[1:13:26] Amen. Let us speak to him.
[1:13:32] Lord Jesus,
[1:13:38] we are here to worship you this
[1:13:42] morning because we know that you care
[1:13:45] about
[1:13:47] us. Many times, Lord, in our
[1:13:52] weakness, many times we
[1:13:57] pretend and hide our feelings from you.
[1:14:04] But Lord, I know that you
[1:14:07] care. And I know you are concerned about
[1:14:09] each and every one of
[1:14:12] us. And I know that you
[1:14:15] desire that we might worship you in
[1:14:18] spirit and in
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:22] truth. And this morning, as we have come
[1:14:24] and gathered around your word this
[1:14:26] morning,
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:29] We have come empty. Fill
[1:14:35] us. We have come with a hunger and a
[1:14:41] thirst. Feed us Lord and quench
[1:14:45] us. Quench our thirst that we have come
[1:14:47] with within our
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:14:50] soul. I ask that Lord you will come and
[1:14:54] touch each of our hearts before we leave
[1:14:56] this place.
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:00] And Lord, by the time we
[1:15:03] leave, May we indeed each of us witness
[1:15:06] the presence of the Holy
[1:15:10] Spirit. Grant it Lord.
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:15] We are
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:23] standing on
[1:15:26] holy
[1:15:30] ground. He said where two or three are,
[1:15:32] he's there.
[1:15:35] And I
[1:15:38] know that
[1:15:40] there are
[1:15:44] angels all
[1:15:52] around. Let us pray.
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:03] Jesus.
[1:16:11] Now we are
[1:16:16] standing
[1:16:18] in his
[1:16:20] presence.
[1:16:27] Oh, now with every eye closed,
[1:16:31] if the musicians can pull it down a
[1:16:33] little
[1:16:35] bit, I'd like us to sing that song
[1:16:39] again. And I want you to believe and I
[1:16:42] want also myself to
[1:16:44] believe that we are in his
[1:16:47] presence. Now he is able to inspire us.
[1:16:52] He's able to uh put words on our lips
[1:16:55] that will just be exactly what you need.
[1:17:02] Now listening to the tapes of a
[1:17:05] prophet many times at the end of the
[1:17:08] service there would be a moment like
[1:17:11] this and then he would speak to the
[1:17:13] people for just a little
[1:17:16] bit and encourage them and tell them
[1:17:19] he's able to
[1:17:21] come and if he comes he will be able to
[1:17:24] call you
[1:17:25] out and he'll be able to speak about
[1:17:27] your
[1:17:28] need and he will tell them only
[1:17:32] believe he's able to come. And he would
[1:17:36] say, "I don't know if he will come or if
[1:17:38] he will not, but I know he promised he
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:43] would." And when the people
[1:17:46] believed in just a moment, he would say,
[1:17:49] "He's now
[1:17:50] here, the Holy Spirit." So friends, I am
[1:17:55] not the prophet. I'm just a preacher.
[1:17:59] But he also in the same way he uses a
[1:18:03] prophet. He uses a
[1:18:06] preacher. The prophet will call you out
[1:18:08] by
[1:18:10] name and tell you about your
[1:18:12] issues. But through the preacher, he
[1:18:15] will speak about your
[1:18:17] issue directly addressed to
[1:18:21] you. So if we will only
[1:18:24] believe, he's able to come and speak to
[1:18:28] you. Let us sing that with all our
[1:18:31] hearts and our hearts lifted up to him.
[1:18:35] Let us approach him the right
[1:18:37] way to surely come and address our
[1:18:41] ears. We are
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:47] standing. Hallelujah.
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:53] on holy
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:19:00] ground. And I I
[1:19:05] know
[1:19:06] there are
[1:19:11] angels all around.
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:21] Great
[1:19:25] praise.
[1:19:28] Hallelujah Jesus.
[1:19:35] Oh yes,
[1:19:38] Lord. We
[1:19:42] are
[1:19:44] singing his
[1:19:46] praises for the
[1:19:49] holy ground. Every hand lifted up. Let
[1:19:52] us sing it one more time. We are
[1:19:57] standing. We are standing.

[1:20:09] morning. Oh, I know there are angels all
[1:20:12] around here this
[1:20:15] morning. I
[1:20:19] know
[1:20:20] there are
[1:20:25] angels all around.
[1:20:30] Come on, let us praise him now.

[1:20:37] praise.
[1:20:41] Hallelujah. Jesus.

[1:21:02] praising
[1:21:06] God. With your hands lifted up, praise
[1:21:08] him. Let us do it now. Let us praise
[1:21:13] him. Let us worship him and tell him,
[1:21:17] Lord, we are here for
[1:21:20] you. Oh Lord, may you come and minister
[1:21:23] to
[1:21:24] us. We are here for you this morning.
[1:21:28] Come and use the preacher this morning
[1:21:29] to minister to our
[1:21:33] needs. We are here Lord
[1:21:37] because of
[1:21:40] you.
[1:21:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[1:22:19] here.
[1:22:24] Father, we are
[1:22:29] here.
[1:22:34] Father, we are here.
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:22:40] We are
[1:22:43] here
[1:22:46] for
[1:22:50] you.
[1:22:55] Spirit, we are here. Can I have someone
[1:23:00] thirsting? Someone hungry this morning
[1:23:03] for his
[1:23:05] presence? We are here. Someone speaking
[1:23:10] to the
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:13] Lord when you dieus.
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:33] Yes, we are here. Truly one
[1:23:43] Jesus. We are here. Oh
[1:23:51] Jesus. We are praying. We are crying. We
[1:23:55] are seeking. We are desiring. Lord, we
[1:23:58] are hungry for you. Lord, we need you.
[1:24:01] Lord Jesus. I need you myself, Lord.
[1:24:05] Jesus.
[1:24:10] We are here this
[1:24:12] morning. We are crying this
[1:24:18] morning. We are
[1:24:23] here. Tell him
[1:24:26] Jesus. Even if you don't feel like
[1:24:28] telling him, just tell him
[1:24:30] anyhow. Tell him I am here alone for you
[1:24:33] this morning. Speak to me. I desire
[1:24:37] you for
[1:24:39] you. Come on now. Everybody should do
[1:24:42] that to him now. Tell him now one more
[1:24:43] time.
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:49] Jesus, I believe the Holy Spirit will be
[1:24:52] pleased to see us hungering for
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:25:01] you.
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:07] Heat. Heat.
[1:25:24] Amen.
[1:25:26] Amen. Amen. Shall we turn our
[1:25:30] Bibles to the book of Psalms chapter 34?
[1:25:53] Psalm 34. We are reading from verses
[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:26:01] 14. You need to decrease this
[1:26:03] microphone. It is having an echo.
[1:26:12] 3414.
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:22] If you are there, say
[1:26:27] amen. I'm happy to see those who have
[1:26:29] sailed through the
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:32] rain. God bless you.
[1:26:35] There are others who failed.
[1:26:39] You need
[1:26:40] to need to break through. We need to
[1:26:43] make our calling and election sure.
[1:26:48] We have to come to the throne with
[1:26:52] boldness. The kingdom of God is taken by
[1:26:57] force. So God bless you for being able
[1:26:59] to
[1:27:01] come. God has something for us.
[1:27:05] He cannot bring us
[1:27:07] here for
[1:27:09] nothing. There is a reason why he has
[1:27:11] brought
[1:27:12] us. Is that a
[1:27:15] man? We are reading from verses
[1:27:22] 14. Um I'm reading from verses chapter
[1:27:27] 34. Depart from evil and do good. Seek
[1:27:30] peace and pursue it. The eyes of the
[1:27:33] Lord are upon the righteous, and his
[1:27:35] ears are open unto their
[1:27:38] cry. The face of the Lord is against
[1:27:41] them that do evil to cut off the
[1:27:43] remembrance of them from the earth. The
[1:27:46] righteous The righteous cry. Everybody
[1:27:50] read
[1:27:51] that. The righteous cry. When was the
[1:27:55] last time you cried?
[1:27:58] When was the last time you, you know,
[1:28:01] became messed up in his
[1:28:06] presence? You see, brothers, don't
[1:28:08] frustrate my interpreter because I don't
[1:28:10] want him to switch
[1:28:13] off. The righteous cry, and the Lord
[1:28:17] heareth, and deliverth them out of all
[1:28:22] their troubles.
[1:28:24] The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a
[1:28:27] broken heart, and saveth such as be of a
[1:28:31] contrite
[1:28:32] spirit. Many are the afflictions of the
[1:28:35] righteous, but the Lord deliverth him
[1:28:38] out of them
[1:28:46] all.
[1:28:56] Number two,
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:15] [Music]
[1:29:34] Amen. You may be seated.
[1:29:38] There are
[1:29:40] times when
[1:29:43] um a preacher comes when he feels the
[1:29:46] fire and is ready to spit it
[1:29:51] out. And there are
[1:29:53] times when he feels convicted about
[1:29:56] speaking a few
[1:30:00] things and sometimes you don't even know
[1:30:03] whether you're going to speak fire.
[1:30:08] And so those are one of the
[1:30:11] days. I just have a few things I feel to
[1:30:14] relate to
[1:30:16] you. And um so I don't know how it will
[1:30:20] come. But um I'm convinced that it is
[1:30:23] the will of God for us to
[1:30:27] hear. Um it's not so much of a do
[1:30:32] doctrine but it it is just basic
[1:30:35] Christianity.
[1:30:38] I I was dealing with the subject of um
[1:30:43] the
[1:30:46] Elijah speaking about
[1:30:49] um um the the the
[1:30:55] C the message staying the
[1:30:59] C. If you've not listened to those
[1:31:03] meetings, I would recommend that you go
[1:31:05] back and listen.
[1:31:09] um because there a few things that God
[1:31:11] was trying to impress upon
[1:31:15] us and I think it would be befitting for
[1:31:18] a church member when you miss a service
[1:31:20] you go back and listen to
[1:31:26] it. Yeah, you do. There was a service
[1:31:29] you didn't where you're not able to come
[1:31:30] to
[1:31:32] church. It is noble for you to either
[1:31:36] stream or when you get time put it on
[1:31:39] and listen. Not jumping jumping listen
[1:31:41] to the whole service.
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:50] It is good for you to listen to I mean
[1:31:53] on YouTube these days there there's like
[1:31:55] every church is
[1:31:58] streaming and we all from time to time
[1:32:01] will go listen to that service listen to
[1:32:03] that church listen to that
[1:32:05] church but I tell you and this I I tell
[1:32:11] you with with all my
[1:32:13] heart it is very important
[1:32:17] for you to follow what is preached in
[1:32:19] your
[1:32:22] church because that is for
[1:32:26] you. We tailor made for
[1:32:31] you only
[1:32:33] you. Um so we we we stream but really we
[1:32:37] are streaming for our
[1:32:43] members from every now and then people
[1:32:46] call from you know text and call from
[1:32:48] different
[1:32:51] countries. Oh I was blessed by the
[1:32:54] ministry and we appreciate that. But uh
[1:32:58] first of all here in the church we
[1:32:59] started
[1:33:02] streaming because when we left Ethiopia
[1:33:05] there was another place in Aasa where
[1:33:07] there was no
[1:33:10] church and those believers were about 30
[1:33:13] or so they were streaming directly from
[1:33:15] us here on Zoom. Actually we're doing a
[1:33:17] kind of Zoom
[1:33:21] connection. If you go back in those old
[1:33:24] old services, you you realize that they
[1:33:26] would also give some special songs and
[1:33:29] you know and so they were like we were
[1:33:35] interconnected and this started way
[1:33:37] before even
[1:33:40] Zoom before the church in Addis was
[1:33:44] established. I remember when we would go
[1:33:46] preach for a
[1:33:48] while two months and then leave the
[1:33:52] believers would be all on their
[1:33:55] own. So we would call
[1:33:58] um I remember how were we calling let's
[1:34:01] try to remember it wasn't we using
[1:34:03] WhatsApp it was something else I don't
[1:34:06] remember either direct call or something
[1:34:09] like that and then we put in a
[1:34:12] conference they would put the phone
[1:34:14] there on the table and I would begin
[1:34:16] preaching a Sunday morning
[1:34:19] service and um well of course the church
[1:34:22] got established in Adis Ababa
[1:34:26] So by the time we left Ethiopia, there
[1:34:29] was need in another area called
[1:34:35] Hawasa where Pastor Ephraim comes
[1:34:39] from and so there at that time they were
[1:34:41] streaming directly by the team. He was a
[1:34:44] deacon um but he was originally from
[1:34:50] Kenya. The believers would gather in his
[1:34:52] home
[1:34:55] And then they would do um those of you
[1:34:57] who were with us in the other small
[1:34:59] place and also at
[1:35:02] home, you remember we used to have uh
[1:35:05] those zoom meetings with
[1:35:09] them and sometimes they would also sing
[1:35:11] their special songs
[1:35:13] and and we would see it and um then we
[1:35:18] would also minister to them.
[1:35:21] technology is
[1:35:22] good if you're using it for the right
[1:35:24] purpose and
[1:35:28] motive. And so uh being that uh many uh
[1:35:33] brethren in Ethiopia look at us as um
[1:35:36] their
[1:35:41] father. When we stopped doing the Zoom
[1:35:45] meetings, I thought it is important also
[1:35:48] to continue streaming.
[1:35:53] That way um even after there are no more
[1:35:56] local service they can always stream and
[1:35:58] and get
[1:36:02] blessed. But also for the believers here
[1:36:05] those who are not able to attend
[1:36:06] services
[1:36:09] sometimes they can be able to
[1:36:12] stream or watch it
[1:36:15] afterwards. Sometimes you even in a
[1:36:18] service and you feel like I need to
[1:36:20] listen to that
[1:36:22] again. That's the purpose why we stream.
[1:36:28] We do not do this because everybody's
[1:36:29] doing
[1:36:31] it. It had an origin which I've just
[1:36:34] given
[1:36:36] you and it has a purpose and a
[1:36:40] motive. It is for
[1:36:43] you. So if a if a service is preached
[1:36:47] and you don't know about it, you are not
[1:36:50] growing with
[1:36:53] others, you will get stunted and it's
[1:36:56] not good. Always go back and
[1:36:59] listen. I was appreciating brother
[1:37:03] polyap. I heard him mention he preached
[1:37:05] for us also on our brother shalom asked
[1:37:08] him to preach in um the home sale.
[1:37:12] So he was mentioning he said that you
[1:37:14] know he missed many services when he was
[1:37:16] at
[1:37:20] school. So when he came back he decided
[1:37:24] to put all of
[1:37:25] them. So since he has been listening to
[1:37:28] one by
[1:37:30] one in the order that it was
[1:37:33] preached. I think that is quite
[1:37:36] noble. I I feel that now streaming is
[1:37:39] for for
[1:37:41] something. He was telling me ah I'm I'm
[1:37:44] I'm being my wife was saying he's
[1:37:48] changing and and I I was also saying he
[1:37:51] was telling me I'm really being
[1:37:54] blessed. He's doing a good work in
[1:37:57] me. I I can assure you if you listen to
[1:37:59] every service that is preached at
[1:38:03] church you cannot remain the
[1:38:05] same. You cannot remain the
[1:38:08] same. Amen. So I was that subject is a
[1:38:12] good subject which you need to go back
[1:38:14] and listen
[1:38:16] to because there was some little
[1:38:19] teaching then putting a few things into
[1:38:22] perspective of what exactly we believe.
[1:38:29] But this morning I want to take another
[1:38:31] turn and speak on the subject vulner
[1:38:34] vulnerable in his
[1:38:42] presence. Vulnerable in his
[1:38:46] presence. Now vulnerability means being
[1:38:50] open about your feelings.
[1:38:58] Being open about your
[1:39:01] fears. Being open about your
[1:39:05] weaknesses. Being
[1:39:07] weak.
[1:39:09] Feble. Accepting to be
[1:39:13] weak. Accepting to be
[1:39:17] feeble.
[1:39:20] Frail without hiding it.
[1:39:26] You see in Lugan I think the word would
[1:39:31] be you know um have you ever seen
[1:39:34] someone who has done something
[1:39:37] wrong and they're being rebuked by an
[1:39:41] elder but they are you know dry
[1:39:45] eyed and um you know they're not
[1:39:49] bothered. They just shrug everything
[1:39:53] off and then when they tell him
[1:39:56] apologize they say okay I'm sorry if
[1:39:59] I've done something
[1:40:00] wrong I'm sorry. You see many people are
[1:40:04] like
[1:40:05] that especially our generation is like
[1:40:08] that. They do not break
[1:40:11] down. They do not accept to show
[1:40:16] weakness. They say if you show we your
[1:40:21] weakness. It means you are going to be
[1:40:24] underlooked you are going to be
[1:40:28] despised. You are going to be seen as if
[1:40:30] you were
[1:40:32] cano. So they always want to I'm so
[1:40:35] happy to see sister Baka. God bless you.
[1:40:37] Nice to see
[1:40:39] you. And you know they say that you know
[1:40:42] uh they don't want to show their
[1:40:45] weakness because according to them
[1:40:48] or according to some of you who are
[1:40:49] listening to me, when you show your
[1:40:52] weakness, you will be taken for granted.
[1:40:55] You will be
[1:40:57] despised. You'll be looked down
[1:41:00] on. So, we have a very strong
[1:41:04] generation that is actually very
[1:41:09] weak. We have a very very strong
[1:41:13] generation that is so fearful
[1:41:18] They have a lot of emotional weak
[1:41:23] feelings but they can never show
[1:41:25] it. You see even that's why when you
[1:41:28] come to
[1:41:29] church you you the word sometimes is
[1:41:33] preached and maybe you are hammered
[1:41:36] seriously and you know that God is
[1:41:38] speaking to
[1:41:39] you but you convince yourself not to
[1:41:42] break it
[1:41:43] down. You convince yourself that you are
[1:41:47] fine. You don't even look down. You look
[1:41:51] at the
[1:41:52] preacher as if to say that uh he's
[1:41:55] preaching to someone
[1:41:57] else. You even don't say
[1:41:59] amen because you feel if you say
[1:42:02] amen, someone may realize they preaching
[1:42:04] about
[1:42:05] you. You see, so you you you behave as
[1:42:09] if that you are fine.
[1:42:12] It's a hypocritical age.
[1:42:15] People don't want to
[1:42:18] break you. You see sometimes when the
[1:42:21] word is
[1:42:22] preached and you know you look at a
[1:42:25] neighbor and say so that they may not
[1:42:30] think it is actually you that was being
[1:42:32] spoken about. So people do not want to
[1:42:36] break
[1:42:37] down yet they are
[1:42:42] broken. You know they are weak. They
[1:42:46] they are feeble
[1:42:48] frail but they hiding it. They are
[1:42:51] actually
[1:42:53] professionals at hiding
[1:42:56] it. They're
[1:42:58] guilty but they will hear the word and
[1:43:01] they will be like a
[1:43:03] rock. They will not accept the word to
[1:43:06] penetrate.
[1:43:08] they will always protect
[1:43:10] themselves because they think if they
[1:43:13] break down they will be embarrassed.
[1:43:17] So today we are speaking about being
[1:43:21] vulnerable in his
[1:43:24] presence. Anyone who is not
[1:43:29] vulnerable can never be received by
[1:43:32] God. Today I want to show
[1:43:35] you by the word that God can only accept
[1:43:41] you if you accept to be
[1:43:46] vulnerable. And if you
[1:43:48] refuse, if you are his
[1:43:50] child, he will allow situations to
[1:43:54] come. He will allow things to happen to
[1:43:57] you that will break
[1:44:00] you. So I have an advice for you.
[1:44:03] Don't let God force you to be
[1:44:06] vulnerable. Unless, of course, if you
[1:44:08] are not his
[1:44:10] child. But if you're his child, he will
[1:44:13] force
[1:44:14] you. He will he will make you. He will
[1:44:18] he will put you in a
[1:44:20] corner until you become
[1:44:23] vulnerable. Until you accept your
[1:44:26] weak, until you cry,
[1:44:30] cry. Then now God will accept
[1:44:34] But you see, you don't have to go it
[1:44:36] that
[1:44:37] way. You can you can hear the word and
[1:44:42] you become
[1:44:43] vulnerable. How? By letting the word
[1:44:46] penetrate into your
[1:44:48] heart by accepting the word to do the
[1:44:51] job it has been sent to
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:56] do. You know, I've often heard that
[1:45:00] preachers that cry on the pullpit are
[1:45:04] despised. And so many times when
[1:45:06] preachers come to
[1:45:09] preach, you know, they they they try not
[1:45:12] to
[1:45:13] cry. They try not to be
[1:45:16] vulnerable. We always try to do that. I
[1:45:19] can assure you. I personally I always
[1:45:23] try not to be vulnerable on the pullpit
[1:45:27] because I look so
[1:45:29] stupid. Imagine a person on the pit
[1:45:31] crying and
[1:45:33] weeping. You look so foolish and stupid
[1:45:35] and as if you don't know what you're
[1:45:38] doing. You look
[1:45:41] childish. But many
[1:45:43] times sometimes you hold it and you
[1:45:46] realize you
[1:45:48] cannot. Why? Because you know you have
[1:45:51] allowed the hol the presence of the Holy
[1:45:54] Spirit to penetrate through your heart.
[1:45:58] I remember there was a
[1:46:00] time uh brother Shalom I think was a
[1:46:03] song
[1:46:05] leading and and you know he started
[1:46:07] crying and and after the service I I
[1:46:12] told him a man you should you you should
[1:46:16] try and and and you know and stand
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:24] and yes I was advising him not to be
[1:46:29] vulnerable. But this morning, I'm
[1:46:32] advising him
[1:46:36] different. It is important for you to
[1:46:41] define, whether you are a song leader or
[1:46:43] a
[1:46:44] preacher, whether you are old or
[1:46:47] young, whether you are big or
[1:46:50] small, whether you are educated or not
[1:46:53] educated, it is a must to be vulnerable.
[1:46:58] in his presence. If you do not
[1:47:01] accept if you are God's
[1:47:04] child, he will make
[1:47:10] you
[1:47:11] today
[1:47:13] please be
[1:47:16] connected because I'm I'm giving you a
[1:47:20] principle which is going to be um which
[1:47:23] is going to be a big breakthrough to
[1:47:25] some of you.
[1:47:29] Now here in the book of
[1:47:31] Psalms, this is King David speaking
[1:47:34] it. And King David had an
[1:47:38] experience
[1:47:39] invulnerability. And so we hearing from
[1:47:41] a man who is
[1:47:44] experienced. He says, "Depart from
[1:47:47] evil, do good, seek peace, pursue it.
[1:47:52] The eyes of the Lord must upon the
[1:47:54] righteous.
[1:47:56] And his
[1:47:57] ears is open unto
[1:48:00] their
[1:48:03] cry. His ears are not open to their
[1:48:07] strength. His ear is not open to their
[1:48:10] prayer. Their strong
[1:48:13] prayers. Oh God, may you do this. Oh
[1:48:16] God. Hallelujah. No. No. No. No. His
[1:48:20] ears are open to their cry.
[1:48:25] God wants to hear a cry of a
[1:48:30] baby. To others, you are a father. To
[1:48:33] others, you are big. To others, you
[1:48:34] educated. But to God, you are a
[1:48:39] baby. When you come in his presence, in
[1:48:43] any situation, anywhere you are, except
[1:48:46] to be
[1:48:48] vulnerable. If you are you are a mother
[1:48:51] or you are a father or you have ever
[1:48:52] been a raised a
[1:48:56] child, you will know that there is one
[1:48:58] thing that devastates a
[1:49:02] parent. Nothing like
[1:49:04] it. That's the cry of a
[1:49:07] baby. The cry of a baby. When a mother
[1:49:11] actually a mother can hear that the baby
[1:49:13] is devastated ways away.
[1:49:19] A mother will have certain things in her
[1:49:21] body which will make her get connected
[1:49:24] to her
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:28] baby when the baby is hungry before even
[1:49:32] the baby
[1:49:33] begins. You know the mother will begin
[1:49:35] to
[1:49:36] feel things
[1:49:38] happening and then her heart will will
[1:49:41] beat for her
[1:49:42] baby. Something must be wrong with my
[1:49:44] child. A mother has a a 60
[1:49:50] sense. She has something some
[1:49:53] connection some connection she has with
[1:49:56] a
[1:49:57] baby. A mother actually mothers have
[1:50:03] instincts. You know when something is
[1:50:05] happening with a
[1:50:06] child you know a mother will feel it
[1:50:08] from a
[1:50:10] distance even if you're in another
[1:50:12] country. One day I was in Tanzania and I
[1:50:16] I was I had gone for a missionary trip
[1:50:18] and I was still going through Salam and
[1:50:21] there I was almost
[1:50:23] killed but my mother back in Uganda
[1:50:27] Uganda you know she felt it she dreamt
[1:50:30] it and she became restless and she
[1:50:33] prayed for me before it even happened
[1:50:36] and I survived because of her prayer.
[1:50:39] What I'm saying a mother has
[1:50:44] instincts before something
[1:50:47] happen and then when you begin crying
[1:50:51] the mother will leave everything she's
[1:50:53] doing. Sometimes I see my wife. You know
[1:50:57] when a baby cry in a bad way. There are
[1:51:00] certain ways that a baby can
[1:51:03] cry that will move a
[1:51:06] mother and there are certain ways a baby
[1:51:08] can cry and a mother will be moved but
[1:51:11] will take longer to
[1:51:13] respond. But but you see there is a
[1:51:16] certain way a baby can
[1:51:18] cry. You know, I remember there was this
[1:51:20] cry that the little baby
[1:51:23] made and my wife was I don't know what
[1:51:25] she was having in her hand, but she
[1:51:28] dropped it and
[1:51:31] she what's happening? Why? There was
[1:51:34] even nothing big. But the way the baby
[1:51:38] cry, but a certain urgent response from
[1:51:42] the
[1:51:44] mother. The Bible calls
[1:51:47] God the blessed
[1:51:49] one. He's our
[1:51:52] mother and he responds to our
[1:51:56] cry. The cry that is
[1:51:59] made. When you become vulnerable,
[1:52:03] when you are weak, when you need help,
[1:52:06] when you are confused, when you cry out,
[1:52:10] our
[1:52:11] father, whenever you cry out, you
[1:52:15] respond and he likes responding to those
[1:52:17] that are
[1:52:19] weaker because those who are weaker are
[1:52:21] more desperate than others.
[1:52:26] They will cry out with a bigger shout,
[1:52:30] with a bigger cry and then mother
[1:52:33] God will come running into the
[1:52:36] earth. Hallelujah. The eyes of the Lord
[1:52:39] are upon the
[1:52:41] righteous. We talked about
[1:52:43] righteousness. It's not your
[1:52:45] righteousness. It is his
[1:52:47] righteousness upon
[1:52:50] you. Amen. Amen. So his
[1:52:53] ears are upon He he his ears are open
[1:52:57] unto their
[1:53:00] cry. Amen. When was the last time you
[1:53:03] cried? When was the last time you cried?
[1:53:05] That's the
[1:53:07] moment. Think about
[1:53:09] it. So, is it to mean that you are not
[1:53:13] vulnerable? Is it to mean you don't have
[1:53:16] problems? Is it to mean you don't need
[1:53:18] help?
[1:53:19] The reason why you've not been crying
[1:53:21] out, the reason why we come here and say
[1:53:24] everybody pray, you can't even cry
[1:53:27] out because you're
[1:53:30] pretending to be strong. You are hiding
[1:53:34] your vulnerability.
[1:53:37] The face of the Lord is against them
[1:53:39] that do
[1:53:43] evil to cut off the remembrance of them
[1:53:46] from the earth.
[1:53:49] But the
[1:53:50] righteous, the righteous, those who have
[1:53:54] become the righteousness of
[1:53:58] God. Are you here this morning? The
[1:54:02] righteous
[1:54:04] cry. Amen. And the Lord
[1:54:07] heareth. Oh my. And deliverth
[1:54:11] them. When you cry, the Lord hear. God
[1:54:16] will hear every
[1:54:18] cry. And when he hears your cry, he will
[1:54:22] not forsake you. He will not leave you
[1:54:25] alone. He will deliver
[1:54:27] you out of all your
[1:54:30] troubles. But the problem when we go
[1:54:32] into
[1:54:33] trouble, we do other things. We don't
[1:54:37] come to be vulnerable in his presence to
[1:54:40] cry out to him.
[1:54:44] You know you have to cry out to God in
[1:54:46] every
[1:54:47] situation. When you are a sinner, you
[1:54:51] realize something has has got a hold of
[1:54:53] you.
[1:54:54] We need to learn to cry out.
[1:54:59] When you don't have money, you don't
[1:55:01] have job. When you're confused, when
[1:55:04] your business is going down, when
[1:55:06] everything is, you know,
[1:55:08] disorganized, you feel you are the one
[1:55:11] who always has problems.
[1:55:13] You have to learn to cry
[1:55:16] out. Stop crying to your friends and
[1:55:19] brothers and
[1:55:20] sisters. The Bible says, "Cast be a man
[1:55:23] who trusts in another
[1:55:26] man." I can help you, but I can't help
[1:55:29] you with
[1:55:31] everything. Your friend can help you,
[1:55:33] but not with
[1:55:35] everything. We need to learn. Crying to
[1:55:38] the
[1:55:39] Lord, being vulnerable.
[1:55:43] in his presence. If you read the book of
[1:55:47] Psalms, you realize what I'm telling
[1:55:49] you. David is our good
[1:55:52] example of a vulnerable man in his
[1:55:57] church. No wonder what God said. We'll
[1:56:00] talk about
[1:56:02] it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now he
[1:56:06] continues on. The Lord is
[1:56:09] near. And to them that are of a broken
[1:56:14] heart. Meaning those who are
[1:56:17] vulnerable. Those who are broken
[1:56:19] broken. Those who have a
[1:56:23] heart that is weak and is broken and and
[1:56:27] has accepted to
[1:56:29] repent and has accepted to
[1:56:32] change and is willing to seek help from
[1:56:35] God.
[1:56:38] God is near
[1:56:40] unto God such that let us be of a
[1:56:43] contrite
[1:56:47] spirit. The righteous will have many
[1:56:52] afflictions. But the Lord deliverth
[1:56:56] him out of all of them, out of them
[1:57:00] all. Meaning, don't you worry, brother.
[1:57:05] Don't you worry, sister. All the
[1:57:08] afflictions that God has permitted to
[1:57:10] come to you, he has the solution. He has
[1:57:14] a solution. No man has a
[1:57:17] solution. But our God, he has a
[1:57:21] solution. But he wants you to cry
[1:57:23] out. He wants you to be
[1:57:26] vulnerable in his presence. And I'm
[1:57:29] going to begin now just reading the
[1:57:31] opening scripture.
[1:57:35] So I'll now begin with a quote from
[1:57:38] questions and
[1:57:41] answers. Uh brother Bam had a very good
[1:57:43] advice for
[1:57:46] me and he asked a question. Wouldn't you
[1:57:49] all like to have a real Bible church?
[1:57:56] Is that a man? Brother Solomon, did you
[1:58:00] hear what the prophet asked?
[1:58:02] He said, "Wouldn't you all like to have
[1:58:05] a a real Bible
[1:58:08] church, a real Bible
[1:58:10] church where all gifts, spiritual
[1:58:14] gifts, we are set in
[1:58:17] order, everything making manifest just
[1:58:20] exactly the way it should
[1:58:23] be. Wouldn't that be
[1:58:26] wonderful? Oh, wouldn't that be
[1:58:28] wonderful if we would have a real Bible
[1:58:31] church?
[1:58:34] Now, you are going to have to
[1:58:39] sacrifice. If we want that real Bible
[1:58:43] church, we are going to have to
[1:58:46] sacrifice. And he said, we are not going
[1:58:49] to have sacrifice
[1:58:51] money. Money will not make a real Bible
[1:58:55] church. It has its
[1:58:57] place. It is not what makes a real Bible
[1:59:00] church.
[1:59:04] What are you going to
[1:59:06] sacrifice? You are going to sacrifice
[1:59:08] some of you your own
[1:59:13] ideas, your own
[1:59:16] ideas. You are going to have to
[1:59:18] sacrifice
[1:59:20] them. And he says you are going to have
[1:59:23] to sacrifice some time in
[1:59:28] prayer. It's not easy.
[1:59:31] Why? Because of time. And you know it is
[1:59:34] so funny. We can have time for
[1:59:37] everything
[1:59:39] else. We usually do for 12 hours in a
[1:59:43] day and 12 hours in the night, but you
[1:59:46] fail to have 30 minutes sacrifice in
[1:59:53] prayer. The the people who sang songs
[1:59:55] they wrote and said, "Take it to the
[1:59:57] Lord in prayer.
[2:00:02] If you go back to that song, if I
[2:00:05] remember, we will sing it at the
[2:00:06] end. Very very good song. Do are you
[2:00:10] discouraged? Do you have are you come
[2:00:12] with a lot of
[2:00:14] care? Do you have issues? Do you have
[2:00:16] problems? Take it to the Lord in
[2:00:19] prayer. But it looks like the church has
[2:00:22] forgotten. We have come to a place where
[2:00:26] prayer is no longer on the menu.
[2:00:30] where fasting is no longer even talked
[2:00:34] about, where time with
[2:00:37] God is no longer
[2:00:40] converted. In every
[2:00:42] revival, there has been
[2:00:45] prayer. There cannot be a revival
[2:00:47] without
[2:00:49] prayer. Even when we talk about the East
[2:00:51] African
[2:00:52] revival, these were men and women of
[2:00:55] pray. the revival in the days of
[2:00:58] wisdom and all these other Pentecostal
[2:01:01] revival. Air was part of the
[2:01:05] ingredient meaning you know you cannot
[2:01:08] become
[2:01:09] vulnerable and not express
[2:01:13] it and you can only express
[2:01:16] it when you are crying when you are
[2:01:19] praying when you are shouting when
[2:01:22] you're falling when you're
[2:01:24] kneeling vulnerability is expressed
[2:01:33] You cannot hide it. But if you don't
[2:01:37] express it, it means you do not have it.
[2:01:43] But if you you are
[2:01:45] vulnerable, you know, you cannot kneel
[2:01:47] before
[2:01:49] somebody unless you respect
[2:01:52] them, unless you accept to submit to
[2:01:57] them. You see, you kneel before your
[2:02:00] husband because you respect him. You
[2:02:03] kneel before whoever your elders because
[2:02:06] you respect him. You see, but you cannot
[2:02:09] kneel before someone you do not submit
[2:02:11] to.
[2:02:14] here in Bugganda. If a woman does not
[2:02:17] kneel to you if you're a
[2:02:21] man, it means she doesn't respect you or
[2:02:26] she feels she's bigger than
[2:02:28] you or she feels you are younger than
[2:02:32] her. That's why women don't kneel before
[2:02:35] children. Is that right? They don't show
[2:02:38] vulnerability before them.
[2:02:41] But when you are expected,
[2:02:44] they kneel before
[2:02:46] you. How much more
[2:02:50] God Christians have forgotten
[2:02:53] to express their vulnerability before
[2:02:58] God? You know when you come before him,
[2:03:01] how many of you even
[2:03:03] kneel now? Now there is no there's no
[2:03:07] posture that you must be in in prayer.
[2:03:14] Prayer is
[2:03:15] prayer. You don't have to always be
[2:03:19] kneeling. I'm saying it's not a doctrine
[2:03:21] to kneel down in
[2:03:23] prayer. But just like uh you know it's
[2:03:27] not a doctrine to kneel down when you
[2:03:29] asking for someone's
[2:03:33] forgiveness. But if you really really
[2:03:36] feel it in your
[2:03:38] heart that sincerely I've hurt that
[2:03:41] person, I've broken that person. I need
[2:03:44] to really move them to forgive
[2:03:47] me. No one will even tell you kneel
[2:03:50] down. It will be automatic. You will
[2:03:54] find yourself kneeling
[2:03:55] down, touching their
[2:03:57] legs, crying,
[2:04:00] forgiving. Why? Because it mean you are
[2:04:03] sincere.
[2:04:05] even with God. You see, you can pray
[2:04:09] while standing, while you know sleeping,
[2:04:12] while kneeling, while moving. I tell you
[2:04:16] what, when it comes to
[2:04:18] vulnerability there, vulnerability has a
[2:04:24] posture. You will
[2:04:28] break. So he says, "You are going to
[2:04:31] have to sacrifice some time in prayer
[2:04:33] for us to have a real Bible
[2:04:40] church." Believers of our time never
[2:04:43] pray. Sister, do you pray? Brother, do
[2:04:47] you pray? Do we pray? If you don't pray,
[2:04:52] you cannot have a Bible
[2:04:54] church. You need time in
[2:04:57] prayer not as a church but as an
[2:05:02] individual because if if we don't pray
[2:05:04] as an individual we cannot even pray as
[2:05:06] a
[2:05:10] church song says let us worship God if
[2:05:15] five people
[2:05:17] drive others reading the
[2:05:19] Bible others looking
[2:05:22] around oh friends there is the problem
[2:05:26] in the
[2:05:27] camp. We need to go back to the
[2:05:30] foundations of
[2:05:32] our we need to be
[2:05:35] vulnerable in his presence whereby he
[2:05:39] can feel amen responsibility of
[2:05:42] answering our cry. Hallelujah.
[2:05:49] He says you are going to have to
[2:05:51] sacrifice your stubborn will.
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:05:58] Many of us are
[2:06:01] stubborn. We are very
[2:06:04] stubborn. You know, you can't even, you
[2:06:09] know, lift up your
[2:06:12] hand is church. It will finish and I'll
[2:06:14] go
[2:06:15] home. And then when you go home, then
[2:06:19] what
[2:06:20] brethren? You see whereby you just come
[2:06:23] here and you are like a
[2:06:25] rock. The word is preached. I'm sorry. I
[2:06:29] I don't mean to ridicule
[2:06:30] you, but I really I'm trying to
[2:06:34] express. You see, whereby you do not
[2:06:39] respond. Where God speaks and you don't
[2:06:43] respond. Where the word goes and you
[2:06:45] don't respond.
[2:06:48] The
[2:06:49] worship, the worship is
[2:06:51] happening and you are just
[2:06:53] there looking
[2:06:56] around. You are not
[2:06:59] responding. You are hiding your
[2:07:03] vulnerability. Let me tell you, you are
[2:07:05] weak. You are
[2:07:07] broken. You have problems. You are
[2:07:10] sinful. But you are hiding it. And
[2:07:13] because you are hiding it, that's why it
[2:07:16] is impossible for you to
[2:07:19] overcome. That's why God is always
[2:07:22] move when he sees
[2:07:25] weakness. He knows he sees it even when
[2:07:28] you have not expressed
[2:07:29] it. But he always responds at the
[2:07:34] expression of
[2:07:38] it. You know many times in a prayer line
[2:07:43] A man would come and then brother begins
[2:07:46] to
[2:07:47] discern we have
[2:07:48] this and then with men he always had
[2:07:53] problems you know he can come and spend
[2:07:56] a little
[2:07:57] time discerning this
[2:08:01] man you go listen
[2:08:03] to why because men always want to
[2:08:06] show they are
[2:08:09] strong the prophet is speaking to
[2:08:12] They're just there. Is that true? Is
[2:08:14] that the truth?
[2:08:17] And then he would just speak a few
[2:08:19] things and tell him, "Go
[2:08:22] believing." But a woman would come
[2:08:25] before he even begin to talk
[2:08:28] she because of the
[2:08:31] presence. The man was he not in the
[2:08:34] presence? He was. But when he felt the
[2:08:38] presence, he shrugged it off.
[2:08:41] Many times we come
[2:08:43] here. The presence is there. The
[2:08:46] presence is tangible. You can feel it.
[2:08:49] You shrug it off. Some of you even move
[2:08:53] out in the time when the presence is
[2:08:58] here and you move
[2:09:02] out. You are not being vulnerable
[2:09:04] enough.
[2:09:08] You have amen to respond to your
[2:09:13] vulnerability and express it before
[2:09:16] God. And you see when this woman comes
[2:09:19] and then brother
[2:09:21] says don't you worry you are fine it
[2:09:24] won't kill you what you're feeling he's
[2:09:28] a presence and then woman is crying
[2:09:31] tears are rolling down after eyes and
[2:09:33] then he would begin
[2:09:34] talking 1 2 3 4 5 6
[2:09:40] 7 about her life and why going
[2:09:44] almost going through her life because
[2:09:47] she has accepted
[2:09:49] vulnerability. She has opened up her
[2:09:52] heart and God is just going through
[2:09:56] it. And let me tell you, brethren,
[2:09:58] that's what we need to do. We need to be
[2:10:04] women cuz we are the bride of
[2:10:07] Christ. We need to be weak. The Bible
[2:10:10] says a woman is a weaker vessel. So we
[2:10:12] need to be like that. We need to be weak
[2:10:15] vessels in his presence.
[2:10:18] That's why he says unless somebody is
[2:10:20] like a
[2:10:23] child, he will never enter the
[2:10:26] kingdom. Meaning grace responds to
[2:10:31] vulnerability, grace,
[2:10:36] grace. When God sees
[2:10:38] vulnerability,
[2:10:40] weakness, expression of
[2:10:43] it, he responds immediately.
[2:10:46] But for us, we are
[2:10:50] stubborn. And he says, you are going to
[2:10:52] have to sacrifice a
[2:10:58] stubbornness. You're going to have to
[2:10:59] sacrifice a
[2:11:01] stubbornness. And he says, you have to
[2:11:03] break down in
[2:11:07] humility. Brother, if you have the
[2:11:09] quote, put it
[2:11:12] here that I'm reading the quote.
[2:11:16] Maybe you see you have to break down in
[2:11:20] humility. Amen. God is not looking for
[2:11:24] powerful
[2:11:25] people. God is not looking for sinless
[2:11:29] individuals. God does not use perfect
[2:11:32] people. But God uses weak
[2:11:36] people. All you the people who are ready
[2:11:38] to be
[2:11:40] vulnerable and accept their
[2:11:42] weak and accept their
[2:11:45] humble accept
[2:11:47] nothing. God loves
[2:11:50] you. That's why look at all the people
[2:11:53] God has
[2:11:55] used the
[2:11:57] ages. These are people who have a lot of
[2:12:01] problems. Call them flaws if you want.
[2:12:07] great servant of
[2:12:08] God has had big
[2:12:11] flaws
[2:12:14] flaws. I can go one by one but I have a
[2:12:18] few I want to show you today and if I
[2:12:21] don't finish maybe on Wednesday I can
[2:12:23] continue this is important for us to
[2:12:27] understand being weak in his
[2:12:30] presence. You have to break down. Tell
[2:12:33] your neighbor you have to break
[2:12:36] down. Accept to break
[2:12:38] down. When you break down, your friends
[2:12:42] may call you a
[2:12:44] fool. They may call you an
[2:12:46] audible. Sometimes I see people breaking
[2:12:48] down in
[2:12:50] church and I see others looking
[2:12:52] at as if to say, "What is wrong with
[2:12:57] you?" You don't know what is wrong with
[2:13:00] you.
[2:13:01] But I will tell you what is wrong with
[2:13:03] them. They are accepting to be
[2:13:07] vulnerable in his
[2:13:09] presence. Hallelujah. When someone is
[2:13:12] vulnerable like
[2:13:14] that, they cannot walk away the
[2:13:17] same. Hallelujah.
[2:13:20] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:13:23] See the world Christian
[2:13:27] move is
[2:13:29] sacrificial. I see one one or two people
[2:13:32] dozing. I'll call you out and it will
[2:13:33] really be a shame. So you better work on
[2:13:37] yourself. I already see two or
[2:13:40] three. I'll help the deacons and I call
[2:13:43] them
[2:13:45] out and it will really really be a
[2:13:47] shame. So please I just wanted to do
[2:13:51] that so you can wake
[2:13:53] up and hear the
[2:13:56] word so you can accept also to to break
[2:13:59] it
[2:14:01] down. Sometimes deacons come they tell
[2:14:04] someone brother you are dozing. No no no
[2:14:07] no
[2:14:09] no
[2:14:12] pretending you know you are you you are
[2:14:15] dozing maybe because you were tired or
[2:14:18] whatever
[2:14:19] accept tell the deacon thank
[2:14:24] you
[2:14:29] someone here you don't accept to break
[2:14:32] down in
[2:14:35] humility you see Brother, you're doing
[2:14:39] no I'm
[2:14:41] not. May God help us. The whole
[2:14:45] Christian move is
[2:14:49] sacrificial. He that will follow
[2:14:52] me. Let him deny
[2:14:57] [Music]
[2:14:59] himself. Let him take up his
[2:15:02] cross and follow me daily.
[2:15:06] Is that
[2:15:07] right? How often do you have to
[2:15:11] sacrifice? Every
[2:15:14] day. Hallelujah. Paul said he died
[2:15:20] daily. Every
[2:15:22] day. May God help me to die for you.
[2:15:29] Amen. David was a man who is a great
[2:15:33] example that I want us to look at. God
[2:15:36] made Saul a
[2:15:38] king. When the Israelites said, "We want
[2:15:40] a
[2:15:41] king." He said, "All right, I'll give
[2:15:43] you a king." So God chose a man and his
[2:15:47] name was Saul. You know how God chose
[2:15:50] him? You know, he told him, "But when
[2:15:53] you go among the prophets, you will
[2:15:55] begin to
[2:15:56] prophesy like them." That will be a sign
[2:15:59] to
[2:16:00] you that you are chosen to be king. And
[2:16:04] when he went among the sons of the
[2:16:05] prophets, he began prophesying the whole
[2:16:08] day to the extent that even the people
[2:16:12] said, "Saul is
[2:16:15] prophesying. Is he one of the
[2:16:19] prophets? That was a sign that God had
[2:16:22] chosen him to be a prophet to be a
[2:16:25] king." So he became a king. God chose
[2:16:29] soul. I'm showing you, God can choose
[2:16:33] you to be
[2:16:36] something. But because you refuse to be
[2:16:39] vulnerable in his presence, he can take
[2:16:43] it away from
[2:16:45] you. Soul never went to
[2:16:48] hell. Saul was not serpent
[2:16:52] sick. God actually forgave Saul.
[2:16:56] You realize that at the end of his
[2:16:58] time when he woke up
[2:17:04] somehow when he woke you called the
[2:17:06] witch of
[2:17:08] endo and they brought up the spirit of
[2:17:11] s he he told him today tonight you be
[2:17:15] with me. You see but we know that
[2:17:18] prophet Samuel was not in
[2:17:20] hell. But of course we know that or were
[2:17:22] going to
[2:17:24] hell in
[2:17:26] paradise in that
[2:17:28] place where they were locked up. But
[2:17:31] when Jesus died and went to uh this same
[2:17:35] place paradise, he opened up those
[2:17:39] doors and he released all of them
[2:17:43] including King
[2:17:44] Saul. So Soul is a
[2:17:46] brother. Call him brother Saul. So,
[2:17:49] brother Saul was chosen by
[2:17:53] God to become a king. But you know, he
[2:17:58] was a proud
[2:17:59] man. He was a man that was having a
[2:18:03] strong
[2:18:04] heart. He never accepted
[2:18:07] correction. He never accepted to be
[2:18:10] humble. He knew who he was. He knew he
[2:18:14] was a king. He always beat up his
[2:18:17] children and he always saw himself above
[2:18:19] his
[2:18:21] brethren because of what God allowed him
[2:18:24] to
[2:18:25] have. Whatever you have in this
[2:18:28] life, God has allowed you to have
[2:18:31] it. The same God who has given it to
[2:18:34] you. He can take it away. But now he
[2:18:38] wants you to humble yourself
[2:18:41] and then you can enjoy the goodness of
[2:18:44] the
[2:18:46] Lord in the land of the
[2:18:49] living. Maybe has given you money. Maybe
[2:18:52] has given you a car. Maybe has given you
[2:18:55] a family. Maybe has given you lands.
[2:18:58] Maybe has given you a
[2:19:01] gift. Whatever he has given you to
[2:19:03] do, he's giving it to you. for two
[2:19:07] reasons. So that your joy may be
[2:19:10] full and also that you may serve
[2:19:14] him and serve his people. But if you
[2:19:18] don't use those things for that
[2:19:20] purpose and you become
[2:19:23] proud and you
[2:19:25] become
[2:19:29] stuffed, he will take it away from
[2:19:32] you. You will still go to heaven.
[2:19:36] But you'll be despised on
[2:19:39] earth. And even in heaven, you can't
[2:19:42] have some
[2:19:44] ranks. What will he say?
[2:19:47] Well done, my good and faithful
[2:19:49] servant. You were good, but you were not
[2:19:53] faithful because you were
[2:19:58] proud. May God help us
[2:20:01] to be humble.
[2:20:05] Praise the name of the Lord. May God
[2:20:07] help you to be
[2:20:11] humble that when I get over
[2:20:14] there, he'll give me his hand. Well
[2:20:18] done, my good and faithful
[2:20:23] servant. I want to be a good
[2:20:25] servant. All of you are
[2:20:28] servants. I want to be a good servant
[2:20:31] and I want to be good and I want to be
[2:20:33] faithful.
[2:20:35] in whatever he has given to
[2:20:37] me. It is for his
[2:20:40] glory for my glory and for his glory. So
[2:20:45] God made
[2:20:47] soul praise the name of the Lord and I
[2:20:50] want to implore
[2:20:52] deacons. You see I was affected a
[2:20:55] bit because of the people moving
[2:20:59] out. Please all of us are adults.
[2:21:04] Some of you, you know, are not very old.
[2:21:06] Most of you are
[2:21:07] young. You can sit through a 1 hour, 1
[2:21:11] hour and a
[2:21:14] half. It is important for you to respect
[2:21:18] the presence of
[2:21:20] God. Stop moving
[2:21:23] up. Please help me with those people
[2:21:26] moving
[2:21:28] up. God bless you. So, we see here Saul
[2:21:34] God made him a
[2:21:35] king. God chose him. And Saul was
[2:21:40] anointed. Don't joke with Saul. He was
[2:21:43] anointed. He was a man of God. He was
[2:21:47] anointed with the spirit of
[2:21:49] God. But you know, Saul was
[2:21:52] proud. He was
[2:21:54] unrepentant. He was
[2:21:57] stiffarted. And you know, God left Saul.
[2:22:02] He removed the kingdom from
[2:22:06] me. I want you to look at verses 10 of
[2:22:09] chapter 15 Samuel.
[2:22:14] He says, "Then came the word of the Lord
[2:22:16] unto
[2:22:17] Samuel, saying, it repenteth me that I
[2:22:21] have set up Saul to be
[2:22:24] king, for he is turned back from
[2:22:26] following me, and has not performed my
[2:22:29] commandments." And it grieved Samuel,
[2:22:33] and he cried unto the Lord all night.
[2:22:45] [Music]
[2:23:03] Friends, I want you I want us to to to
[2:23:05] to to listen to
[2:23:07] this very
[2:23:10] attentively. God chose
[2:23:14] Saul. But Saul refused to do what God
[2:23:18] told him
[2:23:20] to. He became a proud man. And then God
[2:23:23] came down and he says, "I even
[2:23:27] regret. I regret I made soul king."
[2:23:34] Are you one of
[2:23:35] those that are making God
[2:23:38] regret for what he has made
[2:23:41] you? Oh
[2:23:43] God, may I never make
[2:23:48] you. I have set soul to be king. I
[2:23:55] repent. I regret that I set him up to be
[2:24:00] king. for he is turned back from
[2:24:03] following
[2:24:03] [Music]
[2:24:06] me and has not performed my
[2:24:10] commandments and it grieved the
[2:24:13] soul. When a child of God sees another
[2:24:16] child of God in
[2:24:19] sin, it cannot make you
[2:24:22] happy. It will make you
[2:24:25] sad. When Saul had
[2:24:28] that, it grieved him.
[2:24:31] And the Bible say soul cried unto the
[2:24:35] Lord the whole
[2:24:39] night. Not one hour, not two, three,
[2:24:42] four, the whole
[2:24:47] night. What is that?
[2:24:51] Vulnerability. to someone else who would
[2:24:53] have said, "Oh
[2:24:54] God, at least me have been
[2:24:57] faithful, use
[2:25:00] me, let us learn to cry for our
[2:25:05] brothers." Listen, brother, sister, let
[2:25:08] us learn to cry for them when they have
[2:25:12] failed God, when they have sinned, when
[2:25:15] they have strayed away. Let us learn to
[2:25:18] cry. You know he always puts a
[2:25:22] mark on those who cry and
[2:25:25] sigh for the abominations done in the
[2:25:29] city. He loves those
[2:25:32] ones who cry and sigh because of the sin
[2:25:36] in the
[2:25:37] country. We should even pray for
[2:25:40] Uganda. We should pray for our city. We
[2:25:44] should pray for our
[2:25:45] church. When you see someone going
[2:25:48] wrong, pray for them. Pray for the
[2:25:51] leader. Pray for the minister. Don't be
[2:25:55] happy because of sin.
[2:25:57] And then you begin moving it
[2:25:59] around. Oh, cry and
[2:26:02] sad because of the sins
[2:26:05] committed. And then he will seal you
[2:26:08] up. Oh, crying moves
[2:26:12] God. Being vulnerable in his presence.
[2:26:17] We see he has sold the whole
[2:26:22] night he cried unto the Lord. Who are
[2:26:25] you to say you cannot
[2:26:28] cry? Don't you have
[2:26:30] tears? Don't you have
[2:26:33] feelings? Why don't you cry before
[2:26:35] God? Why are you very
[2:26:38] dry? Why are you very dry? Are you
[2:26:41] saying you're very
[2:26:42] strong? That is just religion.
[2:26:46] You have to break down.
[2:26:50] Hallelujah. 1 Samuel
[2:26:53] 15 22. And Samuel said, "As the Lord, as
[2:26:59] the Lord has great delight in burnt
[2:27:01] offerings and
[2:27:04] sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of
[2:27:06] the
[2:27:08] Lord, behold, to obey is better than
[2:27:12] sacrifice.
[2:27:15] and to hecken than the fat of
[2:27:19] rams. For rebellion is at the sin of
[2:27:24] witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[2:27:26] iniquity and
[2:27:30] idolatry because thou has rejected the
[2:27:33] word of the
[2:27:35] Lord. The Lord has also rejected you
[2:27:37] from
[2:27:39] me. Amen. I want I don't want to be
[2:27:42] denied.
[2:27:47] Sister, I want to encourage
[2:27:49] you, brother. Do not let the Lord reject
[2:27:55] you. God can reject
[2:27:57] you and you still go to
[2:28:03] heaven. And you live in this
[2:28:07] world when you you are the one who
[2:28:09] always asks, "But God, why?
[2:28:14] But you still make it to
[2:28:16] heaven. Why does God reject you? Because
[2:28:20] of
[2:28:21] stubbornness, because of of having a
[2:28:23] hard
[2:28:24] heart. You know, you know the Bible says
[2:28:27] because of rebelling against his
[2:28:29] word. You think giving to
[2:28:32] God is better than obeying
[2:28:35] him. Obey his
[2:28:37] voice. And what is his voice? His voice
[2:28:40] is his word. And what I'm preaching to
[2:28:43] you tonight
[2:28:46] is he has said here the Lord is not
[2:28:50] having delight in burnt
[2:28:53] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[2:28:56] the voice of the
[2:28:58] Lord. So
[2:29:00] rather humble yourself, break it down,
[2:29:04] except to be
[2:29:06] corrected. Some people can't even seek
[2:29:08] for
[2:29:10] help. That is
[2:29:13] pride. We are all weak.
[2:29:19] I am a weak
[2:29:21] thing. You are a weak thing. You are a
[2:29:24] weak. All of us are
[2:29:26] weak. We need
[2:29:28] help from the savior.
[2:29:31] Some of you go die with your
[2:29:34] problems because you don't want to be
[2:29:36] held. You don't want to look stupid or
[2:29:39] look foolish or look
[2:29:41] humble. You don't want to be
[2:29:44] despised. You are hiding your
[2:29:47] weakness. Accept
[2:29:52] [Applause]
[2:29:54] vulnerability. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:29:57] Accept vulnerability.
[2:30:01] You know the other day my wife was
[2:30:05] rebuking
[2:30:06] me and she said dear but remember I'm
[2:30:09] your
[2:30:09] wife. I can correct
[2:30:14] you. Okay. It is not
[2:30:17] easy to accept
[2:30:21] weakness especially for
[2:30:25] men. They want always to show they are
[2:30:28] good and the better they on top of
[2:30:32] it. One time I told my wife, "Don't you
[2:30:35] worry even if I don't accept but in my
[2:30:39] heart I've
[2:30:43] accepted later. You will see me
[2:30:47] changing." But I'm preaching to myself
[2:30:50] tonight and I'm preaching to you men.
[2:30:53] Accept weakness.
[2:30:56] Say I am sorry.
[2:30:58] I need to change. I need a
[2:31:01] savior. Pray for me.
[2:31:04] [Applause]
[2:31:06] Hallelujah.
[2:31:08] We need to accept
[2:31:10] weakness. Amen. Because you see
[2:31:14] vulnerability has
[2:31:16] something that moves
[2:31:20] God. Hallelujah.
[2:31:23] Some people think they are higher than
[2:31:26] others. We are all low
[2:31:30] people. We are all
[2:31:33] mas without him we can do
[2:31:37] nothing. We are useless without
[2:31:39] him. We need
[2:31:41] him. You are not higher than
[2:31:45] anyone. All of us are
[2:31:47] nothing. If Jesus Yes. could say without
[2:31:51] him I am nothing.
[2:31:54] What about me
[2:31:57] and without him we are nothing.
[2:32:02] [Music]
[2:32:05] We should always seek for help when we
[2:32:07] need
[2:32:10] it. Hallelujah. And when we come before
[2:32:12] the Lord we should accept vulnerability.
[2:32:18] Oh, when I go and I begin crying, say,
[2:32:21] "Oh, Father, help me." They will say,
[2:32:23] "I'm a big
[2:32:25] sinner. So what?"
[2:32:29] Are they
[2:32:30] not? They're bigger sinners than
[2:32:33] you and they're worse off than
[2:32:36] you because you have accepted to show
[2:32:39] your vulnerability for his
[2:32:44] presence. Hallelujah.
[2:32:47] I want I want to show you this thing
[2:32:49] here.
[2:32:50] God came down and he said,
[2:32:53] "Soul, because of your hard
[2:32:58] hard because I'm not obeying me. Because
[2:33:01] of your
[2:33:03] stubbornness, I have rejected you from
[2:33:05] being
[2:33:06] king. Oh God, use me. God use me." You
[2:33:09] don't need even to pray for him to use
[2:33:12] you. Just break in his prayers.
[2:33:16] Be humble. You remember when God chose
[2:33:21] Saul, he was
[2:33:23] [Music]
[2:33:25] humble. He had obeyed his
[2:33:28] father to go look for a
[2:33:31] lost. That man was humble. He was a
[2:33:36] nobody. God loves choosing little
[2:33:39] nobodyies. He made him a
[2:33:42] prophet. when he was a
[2:33:45] nobody. When God chooses you and you
[2:33:48] accept his God, even when you nobody can
[2:33:52] make
[2:33:54] a after he has made you a
[2:33:57] somebody remain broken in his
[2:34:01] presence. Hallelujah.
[2:34:04] I want you to see
[2:34:07] here when God now chooses another
[2:34:11] man. I want you to see the
[2:34:18] criteria. The criteria or the the
[2:34:21] criteria of
[2:34:25] choice. Yes. Amen. 1 Samuel 13:8.
[2:34:31] and heed seven days according to the
[2:34:32] seven set time that someone had
[2:34:36] [Music]
[2:34:37] appointed and but Samuel came not to
[2:34:41] Gila and the people were scattered from
[2:34:44] here. So here listen listen church
[2:34:46] please. So here is
[2:34:49] Saul in this place waiting for the
[2:34:54] prophet to come and make the
[2:34:57] sacrifice. That was not the duty of a
[2:34:59] king.
[2:35:01] That was the duty of a
[2:35:03] prophet stroke
[2:35:05] priest. But we see here the people were
[2:35:09] scattering from
[2:35:11] soul. And verse 9 says, "And Saul
[2:35:15] said, bring his ab offering to
[2:35:19] me. Bring the peace offerings
[2:35:23] also." And he offered the burnt
[2:35:27] offering. And it came to pass
[2:35:30] As soon as he had made an end of the
[2:35:32] offering, the burnt
[2:35:35] offering,
[2:35:37] behold, brother Samuel
[2:35:43] came, now I want to see this man. Is he
[2:35:47] humble or he is
[2:35:50] proud? And Saul went out to meet
[2:35:54] him that he might salute
[2:35:56] him. And Samuel said,
[2:36:02] prophet to a king.
[2:36:04] Now, what have you
[2:36:08] done? Pastor to a millionaire
[2:36:13] brother. No, pastor to a millionaire
[2:36:20] brother. What have you done? You know,
[2:36:22] many churches, they tend to respect rich
[2:36:26] people. They even give them front seats.
[2:36:30] those ones they cannot do anything to
[2:36:32] them. You cannot rebuke a rich
[2:36:35] person because if they get angry around
[2:36:37] the
[2:36:38] church, the church loses
[2:36:42] offering. But in the message, whether
[2:36:45] you are poor or you are
[2:36:46] rich, you are a brother, you are a
[2:36:50] sister. There is no honorable brothers.
[2:36:55] Honorable sisters, if you're a honorable
[2:36:58] out when you are here, you were a
[2:37:02] brother. Hallelujah.
[2:37:05] Therefore, we should always feel the
[2:37:10] same. There are some churches where they
[2:37:13] don't respect poor people, they respect
[2:37:16] rich ones. And when the offering comes
[2:37:19] from the rich brothers, the pastor will
[2:37:22] pray until he will sweat.
[2:37:26] But when it is from a poor sister,
[2:37:29] brother, God bless him.
[2:37:33] Amen. But I'm so glad. We are not among
[2:37:37] those. We are the bride of Christ. We
[2:37:41] have been
[2:37:42] delivered from those things. We are
[2:37:46] in another place. We are in the bright
[2:37:51] age. Hallelujah.
[2:37:54] We are getting ready for the coming of
[2:37:57] the
[2:37:57] Lord. The things of the
[2:38:01] world, they can't take us. Yes, sir.
[2:38:05] Hallelujah. Amen. We don't despise
[2:38:08] anyone. We respect
[2:38:12] everyone. Hallelujah.
[2:38:14] And if you have ever felt despised by
[2:38:18] anyone, that person who despised you is
[2:38:21] the one with the problem.
[2:38:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:38:28] Listen. So
[2:38:30] Saul was being asked by the prophet,
[2:38:34] what have you
[2:38:35] done? And Saul said, I expected him to
[2:38:39] say, the man of
[2:38:43] God. But what did he say?
[2:38:50] Oh, I
[2:38:52] saw that the people were scattered for
[2:39:01] me, and that thou camest not within the
[2:39:04] days
[2:39:07] appointed, and the Philistines gathered
[2:39:10] themselves
[2:39:15] together. Therefore,
[2:39:21] Therefore, said I, the Philistines will
[2:39:26] come down upon
[2:39:27] me to
[2:39:29] Gila, and I have not made supplication
[2:39:32] unto the
[2:39:36] Lord. I forced
[2:39:41] myself and I offered the B offering.
[2:39:51] But pastor because you came
[2:39:54] late. I decided to do it my
[2:39:59] myself. You have your
[2:40:02] responsibility and even a pastor
[2:40:04] has a deacon has his
[2:40:12] respian. Everybody here has
[2:40:15] which God
[2:40:17] gave
[2:40:19] others that is your
[2:40:26] responsibility that is not allotted to
[2:40:30] you that is
[2:40:35] pride
[2:40:37] say done
[2:40:40] foolishly th not kept the commandment of
[2:40:43] the Lord thy God
[2:40:46] which you commanded thee. For now would
[2:40:49] the Lord have established thy kingdom
[2:40:51] upon Isa
[2:40:54] forever, but now kingdom shall not
[2:41:06] continue. The Lord assought him a man
[2:41:10] after his own heart.
[2:41:16] Amen. The Lord
[2:41:23] ass. Do you know there are people living
[2:41:26] on earth today? There are me men and
[2:41:33] women. Who are those? Those are the ones
[2:41:37] who have a broken
[2:41:40] heart.
[2:41:41] Those are the ones who accept to be
[2:41:46] vulnerable in his
[2:41:49] presence. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[2:41:52] Lord has commanded him to be captain
[2:41:54] over his
[2:41:56] people. When he says you shall be heads,
[2:41:58] not
[2:41:59] tails. He doesn't mean
[2:42:02] everybody. He means these ones, the
[2:42:05] vulnerable one. You shall be heads and
[2:42:09] not
[2:42:10] tails. Amen. Amen. Because you have kept
[2:42:14] because you have kept the commandment of
[2:42:15] the
[2:42:16] Lord, he will remove it from the
[2:42:19] others and he will give it to you. Let
[2:42:22] me tell you, brethren, I'm giving you a
[2:42:25] principle today. If you want favor from
[2:42:30] God, just be vulnerable.
[2:42:33] be vulnerable in his presence because
[2:42:37] there are some brothers, there are some
[2:42:40] sisters who are proud, who are proud,
[2:42:44] who cannot be
[2:42:46] corrected. God is getting ready. He will
[2:42:49] take that grace which had given to them.
[2:42:53] They will not go to hell. He will remove
[2:42:56] it from them and give it to you and he
[2:42:59] will use you. He will make you
[2:43:01] glad.
[2:43:03] Oh, this is the kind of
[2:43:05] blessing that you did not ask
[2:43:11] for. You do not pray for them. You did
[2:43:14] not fast for them. You did not plead for
[2:43:16] them. The only thing you did was to be
[2:43:20] vulnerable in his presence to cry out to
[2:43:24] him in
[2:43:26] prayer to be
[2:43:29] obedient to him. Oh, if God can give us
[2:43:33] two, three, four brothers
[2:43:35] here that can be vulnerable in his
[2:43:40] presence. When they sin, they quickly
[2:43:45] repent. When they go astray, they
[2:43:48] quickly come back. They cry out to the
[2:43:53] Lord. Those are the ones he's looking
[2:43:56] for. Amen. David was not a perfect
[2:44:01] man. David was a man that kind of man
[2:44:05] that had the
[2:44:07] ability of lasting after a woman who was
[2:44:11] not his
[2:44:13] wife and actually took her. He did not
[2:44:16] stop there. He had the ability of
[2:44:19] killing the husband, a man who committed
[2:44:22] adultery, a man who committed, a man who
[2:44:26] murdered. But yet God still say he is a
[2:44:30] man after my
[2:44:34] heart.
[2:44:35] What? So a man after God is
[2:44:39] heart perfect man is a man who
[2:44:43] accepts to be vulnerable.
[2:44:47] When the prophet of God came down, he
[2:44:50] told he told David, "Oh, there is this
[2:44:54] someone to who went and stole the
[2:44:57] neighbor's
[2:44:59] field." Was it a
[2:45:01] field of
[2:45:03] sheep and he killed it for his
[2:45:06] friends? And yet this one had only one
[2:45:10] and the other
[2:45:12] had. and the pretending
[2:45:15] king, the hypoc hypocritical
[2:45:19] king. Many of us many times we
[2:45:24] pretend we are actually
[2:45:27] hypocrites. Many
[2:45:29] times and that's okay as long as you can
[2:45:34] eventually break
[2:45:36] down before the Lord and
[2:45:41] repent. But you see, When the king heard
[2:45:44] that he said what? Who has done
[2:45:50] that? He is to be
[2:45:56] killed. And the prophet
[2:45:59] said, "Live long the
[2:46:02] king. You are the
[2:46:05] one." The king did not say, "I want you
[2:46:09] to see the difference between soul and
[2:46:11] death.
[2:46:14] David not
[2:46:15] say no I have no
[2:46:18] problem I was just you know in my place
[2:46:22] and this girl was showering naked
[2:46:24] there it was a problem and the heavens
[2:46:28] were
[2:46:29] open and I did not mean
[2:46:32] it even the mother
[2:46:35] of I did not do it with my hand I only
[2:46:39] told Joah to put him on the front
[2:46:44] Is he not a soldier? What did he sign up
[2:46:51] for? He
[2:46:53] died. So what have I
[2:46:57] done? But what did he do? He didn't
[2:47:01] explain. He didn't reason with God. He
[2:47:04] didn't question the prophet. He didn't
[2:47:07] rebuke the man of God. He faced the
[2:47:10] wall and started
[2:47:13] crying crying unto you. You alone have I
[2:47:20] s Please God take away my
[2:47:25] sins. Wash me with your cleans me and
[2:47:30] make me whole. Create in me and clean
[2:47:34] out
[2:47:36] of every
[2:47:38] do not take away your Holy
[2:47:41] Ghost. That's a man that has a broken
[2:47:46] heart. That's a man that is
[2:47:51] vulnerable in the presence of
[2:47:54] God. He was
[2:47:57] honest. He was a man after God is on
[2:48:01] hand. And then
[2:48:03] immediately God forgave
[2:48:06] him.
[2:48:08] His first son
[2:48:10] died. But the same
[2:48:12] woman who he had strength for
[2:48:15] Muria gave birth to his second
[2:48:18] son who became
[2:48:20] Solomon, the next king of
[2:48:25] Israel. Talk about
[2:48:27] grace. Hallelujah. I know that
[2:48:31] favor be vulnerable before
[2:48:35] him will give you
[2:48:37] grace you don't
[2:48:42] desire men talking and saying you did
[2:48:47] that will
[2:48:49] say I don't know what they did because
[2:48:52] your
[2:48:54] sins see for us it doesn't matter your
[2:49:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What matters is
[2:49:03] you have been
[2:49:10] vulnerable. Others have done what you
[2:49:12] have
[2:49:13] done. You explained it away. They're
[2:49:16] living with it. They pretending with it.
[2:49:20] But for you, you broke down in his word.
[2:49:24] That is the
[2:49:26] difference. Hallelujah. That is what God
[2:49:29] accepts. He said to this man, "Will I
[2:49:34] look that has a broken
[2:49:37] heart and a
[2:49:39] contrast?"
[2:49:42] Hallelujah.
[2:49:44] Amen. In many
[2:49:46] psalms, David expresses
[2:49:49] fear. He expresses
[2:49:52] guilt. He expresses
[2:49:54] sadness and a longing.
[2:49:58] He hides nothing from
[2:50:00] God. There are many Psalms I would have
[2:50:03] read. But here in Psalm
[2:50:05] 66, he says, "I'm weary with my
[2:50:13] groaning. All the night I make my bed to
[2:50:21] swim. I water my couch with my tears.
[2:50:26] He was a vulnerable
[2:50:29] man, but yet a man
[2:50:35] after. When God chooses to use
[2:50:37] you, it's not because you're perfect,
[2:50:40] brother. Amen. It's not because you're
[2:50:43] perfect,
[2:50:44] sir. It is because you have accepted
[2:50:50] vulnerability. And then he gives you
[2:50:52] another
[2:50:54] chance and then he gives you grace. But
[2:50:57] where you hide
[2:50:58] away and you
[2:51:01] pretend he will reject
[2:51:05] you. You see God told
[2:51:09] brother he says how many of some will
[2:51:13] raise up your hands and say that you
[2:51:14] have you heard me say that the Holy
[2:51:16] Spirit told
[2:51:19] me that it would come to pass that if I
[2:51:23] be
[2:51:24] sincere not greedy with
[2:51:27] money not be try to be some big
[2:51:31] person but be humble and keep little and
[2:51:35] know that he would give to me the
[2:51:40] gift to know the secret of the heart. So
[2:51:43] you you tell me that God gives gifts the
[2:51:46] way he
[2:51:48] wants. He has a basis.
[2:51:52] God is a
[2:52:00] sin. He told the
[2:52:03] prophet, "I've given
[2:52:05] you, I am going to
[2:52:08] add, if you please me, your
[2:52:12] heart, if it pleases me without
[2:52:17] greedy, if you are, if you are honest,
[2:52:22] I've given you the
[2:52:23] healing and I will
[2:52:28] add I will add
[2:52:31] you God will add on
[2:52:33] you what he has given you. It is the
[2:52:37] beginning. Hallelujah. Amen. What he has
[2:52:40] given you just the
[2:52:43] beginning. Just be
[2:52:46] sincere. Be
[2:52:48] humble. Keep little and low.
[2:52:52] To those of you who get a job or who who
[2:52:55] get some kind of
[2:52:56] management or you get an educational
[2:52:58] kind of thing you get whatever whatever
[2:53:02] you have God is getting ready to
[2:53:05] add but there is a
[2:53:08] condition you will keep humble little
[2:53:11] and
[2:53:13] low be
[2:53:16] sincere then he's going to
[2:53:21] How many knows that I said that would
[2:53:24] happen and then the prophet says
[2:53:28] 1959. Now that has
[2:53:32] happened. Now he promised me keep humble
[2:53:36] and I will do exceedingly
[2:53:38] [Music]
[2:53:43] abundantly. And I tell you the same
[2:53:45] thing
[2:53:46] today, brethren. Keep
[2:53:49] humble. Be sincere. Be
[2:53:53] honorable. God will do
[2:53:59] ability.
[2:54:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Before I finish, I I
[2:54:05] want you to give me 20 more
[2:54:06] minutes. I here in life
[2:54:10] story. I'm going to take my time to read
[2:54:13] for you this because many of you are bad
[2:54:16] readers. I want you to to read it for
[2:54:19] you. I want you to hear
[2:54:20] it. Brother Bham gives his life
[2:54:23] story. And here he gives a story about
[2:54:26] his
[2:54:27] family. He had his first wife. And
[2:54:30] because brother Bam
[2:54:32] refused to listen to God, he refused to
[2:54:36] go serve God. God
[2:54:39] killed that
[2:54:43] woman. If you refuse to be
[2:54:46] sincere to be
[2:54:48] vulnerable, don't you worry. God will
[2:54:51] force
[2:54:52] you. But his
[2:54:54] hand when he forces you is
[2:54:59] terrible. None of us want it. Let us
[2:55:02] learn from this story.
[2:55:06] is quite something
[2:55:10] disturbing but it happened in William
[2:55:13] Brham's life and we can use it as an
[2:55:17] example and I will begin in the middle
[2:55:19] because of
[2:55:20] time but then he says I thought it was
[2:55:23] something funny when she got to Fort
[2:55:28] Wayne she he's talking about his wife
[2:55:32] she had to get another pair of stockings
[2:55:35] So here he is giving a
[2:55:37] story. His wife wanted some
[2:55:40] stocks and he went and bought them. But
[2:55:43] you know he was
[2:55:44] proud. She didn't want the woman the
[2:55:46] shopkeeper to
[2:55:49] know that he did not know the
[2:55:51] differences in the
[2:55:53] socks. So he got the one which is not
[2:55:55] the type of his
[2:55:58] wife. And and so later on at the on the
[2:56:04] deathbed his wife tells him, "You
[2:56:07] remember those socks?"
[2:56:09] Actually, those were not my size.
[2:56:12] But brother Bam, when he went to the
[2:56:15] shop, this woman said, "Which type does
[2:56:18] she
[2:56:18] want?" And she mentioned the name. And
[2:56:21] brother said, "Yes, that's right. Yeah,
[2:56:24] give me those." So when he took it home,
[2:56:27] the sister didn't say anything. But what
[2:56:29] if she did? She gave it to the mother
[2:56:32] and for her she bought
[2:56:34] others. And and so that's the part here
[2:56:37] he's talking
[2:56:38] about. But she told me she said there in
[2:56:42] her dying
[2:56:44] hour. She said, "Bill them was for an
[2:56:48] older
[2:56:49] woman. I gave them to your mother."
[2:56:53] She said that she said I kept that from
[2:56:56] you because I didn't want to hurt your
[2:56:59] feelings that you got oh my you don't
[2:57:02] know how but made me
[2:57:05] feel I said bless your heart honey she's
[2:57:08] at the hospital right now hospital
[2:57:10] bed almost dying and they're having this
[2:57:14] moment
[2:57:14] together so she looked up and she said
[2:57:18] I'm
[2:57:19] going and I said are you honey she Yes.
[2:57:23] I said, "Sweetheart, when you go and
[2:57:26] then he says here, you believe anything
[2:57:27] you want
[2:57:29] to, he's not talking to
[2:57:32] you." Brother B is talking to us.
[2:57:35] Believe anything you want to. I don't
[2:57:37] believe a Christian
[2:57:38] dies. There is no scripture for it in
[2:57:40] the Bible. No sir. He that hearth my
[2:57:44] words and believe on him that sent me
[2:57:45] has passed from death to
[2:57:48] life. I am the resurrection and the
[2:57:50] life.
[2:57:52] He that believeth on me, though he were
[2:57:55] dead, yet shall he live, and whosoever
[2:57:58] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[2:58:00] die. Can we all say amen to
[2:58:03] that? So I said, "Honey, I will take
[2:58:06] your body out
[2:58:08] here and I'll bury it up there in walnut
[2:58:12] region and if Jesus tries, I'll be in
[2:58:16] the battlefield somewhere.
[2:58:18] If not, I will be buried by your
[2:58:22] side. I said that morning when the sun
[2:58:25] refuses to
[2:58:27] shine. The moon turns black like
[2:58:30] blood. I said the world is all cold and
[2:58:34] waiting. You go to the city gates. If
[2:58:37] you go before
[2:58:40] me, I said you go over to the city gates
[2:58:43] on the east
[2:58:45] side and you stand there. When you see
[2:58:48] Abraham, Isaac, and
[2:58:50] Jacob, them coming in, I said, talking
[2:58:55] to his wife, go to the screaming, begin
[2:58:58] screaming,
[2:58:59] Bill just as loud as you can. And I
[2:59:03] said, I'll get the kidies
[2:59:06] together. I'll get them together, the
[2:59:08] children, and I'll meet you there at
[2:59:11] the In other words, he's telling the
[2:59:13] wife, don't you worry, honey. we will
[2:59:16] meet on the
[2:59:18] Easter. And she raised up them bony
[2:59:23] hands and embraced around
[2:59:27] it. I kissed her
[2:59:30] goodbye. She closed her
[2:59:33] eyes and we went to meet our God.
[2:59:37] That was my last date with my
[2:59:40] wife and by the grace of God I'm trying
[2:59:43] to my best to make double
[2:59:47] time. That's the reason I tried so hard
[2:59:50] to preach day and
[2:59:53] night one campaign after
[2:59:56] another trying to make up for what I
[2:59:58] lost one
[3:00:00] day. If you refuse to pray, God will let
[3:00:03] situations happen to
[3:00:05] you that they will make you pray 24
[3:00:10] hours. If you refuse to come to church
[3:00:12] and you a
[3:00:13] Christian, God will allow
[3:00:17] situations to bring you here until you
[3:00:19] will be the one coming here before any
[3:00:21] service
[3:00:24] open. You can even call the person to
[3:00:26] see if you have a service on
[3:00:29] Tuesday. God is able to do
[3:00:33] anything. Have a broken heart. Don't let
[3:00:36] God make
[3:00:37] you. If you you refuse to leave that sin
[3:00:41] and you refuse to break down and seek
[3:00:43] for
[3:00:43] help, God will allow things to
[3:00:47] happen that he will humble
[3:00:49] you that you will never even want to
[3:00:52] smell that
[3:00:54] sin. Brother Brandham refused to
[3:00:57] preach now because of what happened.
[3:01:01] He is saying now I preach day and
[3:01:04] night. I'm trying to make up for the
[3:01:09] lost. Oh, it was hard when I went
[3:01:12] home. I went home. I tried to go to bed.
[3:01:16] Mother wanted me to come over
[3:01:18] home. I couldn't. And then I remember I
[3:01:22] went over to our little old
[3:01:25] place. There wasn't nothing there. And
[3:01:29] we didn't have
[3:01:30] nothing. I guess $10 would have bought
[3:01:32] everything we had in the
[3:01:35] house. But it was
[3:01:37] ours. She kept it clean. And it was
[3:01:41] ours. And there was no place like
[3:01:44] home. But now she's
[3:01:47] gone. Now she's gone. He's all by
[3:01:50] himself. I don't care how humble it
[3:01:53] is. There's no place like home.
[3:02:00] So, brother Bam, when his wife
[3:02:01] died, he he tried to go to his mother's
[3:02:04] place, he couldn't fit there. He went
[3:02:08] back to his home, but he wasn't home
[3:02:10] anymore because his wife was no longer
[3:02:14] there. You know, if you want to follow
[3:02:17] the
[3:02:18] story, it was because the wife of um the
[3:02:21] the mother of this woman
[3:02:26] had refused to brother take this woman
[3:02:28] to the meetings and campaigns and things
[3:02:30] like
[3:02:33] that and he
[3:02:35] obeyed. See these things that
[3:02:38] happened. She died
[3:02:42] and now he's gone home and there is
[3:02:46] nothing. It doesn't look like home. He
[3:02:49] says, he says it was so
[3:02:53] small. Some of you have so small things
[3:02:55] at home. Brother says at this
[3:02:59] time,
[3:03:01] $10, that's about 30,000
[3:03:06] shillings, was able
[3:03:10] to buy the things they had in their
[3:03:15] home. Don't despise what you
[3:03:19] have. As long as you are
[3:03:22] happy and God has given you those things
[3:03:26] with a clean
[3:03:29] heart, serve him
[3:03:33] faithfully. Appreciate what you have.
[3:03:38] And he's saying she the wife used to
[3:03:40] keep it
[3:03:42] clean and he says I went over
[3:03:45] there and laid down try to go sleep that
[3:03:49] night. I never forget it. I know a
[3:03:53] little old mouse had gotten down a great
[3:03:56] way. We had some papers up there and I
[3:04:01] heard she used to lay there and she
[3:04:04] would have her some candy.
[3:04:07] and his wife would give her
[3:04:12] something and I sounds like hands and I
[3:04:14] I got
[3:04:16] crying when he had the
[3:04:20] command. Appreciate your wife if you
[3:04:22] still have
[3:04:24] her. Appreciate your husband if you
[3:04:28] still appreciate those small moments
[3:04:30] that you
[3:04:33] have. And I started crying. And I shut
[3:04:36] the door
[3:04:37] together. And hanging on the back of the
[3:04:40] door was was her kimono hanging on the
[3:04:43] back of her
[3:04:46] door. And oh my, there it was all over
[3:04:50] again. And and while I was laying there
[3:04:54] crying, someone knocked at the
[3:04:56] door. It was
[3:04:59] he it
[3:05:01] was the man is called Bro. And he come
[3:05:05] and he said, "Brother Billy," I said,
[3:05:08] "Yes,
[3:05:11] sir. He said, "I got some bad news for
[3:05:16] you." I said, "Brother Frank, I just
[3:05:19] took her to the
[3:05:25] mock." He said, "That's not all of it.
[3:05:29] Your baby's dying also shall be
[3:05:31] lost." I said, "Surely
[3:05:35] I said Dr. Ad is taking He said Dr. Ad
[3:05:38] is taking her to the hospital
[3:05:41] now. He thinks she's
[3:05:44] dying and I couldn't hold it no longer.
[3:05:48] I got up and I tried to walk. I couldn't
[3:05:51] do it. My strength was all
[3:05:54] gone. They had held me by the
[3:05:57] arms. He set me in the old
[3:06:01] truck and he took me out there at the
[3:06:03] hospital and I walked in and there was
[3:06:06] some Dr. Sama there standing at the
[3:06:10] door. He said, "Billy, don't go to
[3:06:15] her. She's dying,
[3:06:17] Sunny. She's contracted from her mother
[3:06:20] this tuberculosis many injured many."
[3:06:25] It went to the
[3:06:27] spine and said she's dying. You can't go
[3:06:31] to see
[3:06:32] her said on account of Billy
[3:06:36] Paul. You can't go to see
[3:06:39] her because he had another
[3:06:41] son who if he went see this
[3:06:45] one also get the
[3:06:47] sickness and bring it
[3:06:50] to. I said talk. I got to see my
[3:06:54] baby. I said, "Let me see her. Won't you
[3:06:59] talk?" He said, "Bill, I can't do it
[3:07:04] on his men in
[3:07:07] son. If you carry in your clothes
[3:07:09] somewhere
[3:07:11] else, I said you can carry it
[3:07:17] out." I said, "Doc, let me go down
[3:07:20] there. Give me some
[3:07:23] chloroform. Give me some chloroform and
[3:07:26] let me die with
[3:07:29] her. I said
[3:07:31] life. What is it to me
[3:07:34] now? Everything I've got is
[3:07:40] God. I'm talking about the story of a
[3:07:45] prophet. A man of God that he
[3:07:48] used. This is what he went through. hate
[3:07:51] him because of refusing to be
[3:07:56] vulnerable and he started crying and a
[3:08:00] nurse stood there and
[3:08:02] said I can't let you go in there
[3:08:05] brother when she turned her
[3:08:07] back I
[3:08:09] slipped anyhow and went down into the
[3:08:14] basement isolated
[3:08:17] place a very cheap like hospital
[3:08:22] And there down there they had this
[3:08:24] little cheese she clo laying over her
[3:08:26] face to keep the flies
[3:08:30] off to keep the flies
[3:08:35] off. He's talking about his little
[3:08:38] girl and her little spasms she was
[3:08:42] having with that that many jets had
[3:08:44] knocked that off.
[3:08:56] And the
[3:08:57] flies was in her little baby's
[3:09:04] eyes. If you don't have a
[3:09:06] child, you may not
[3:09:09] understand. But these things are
[3:09:10] difficult to read.
[3:09:14] and I shued the flies off of her
[3:09:17] eyes and looked at her and said, "Sh,
[3:09:23] honey,
[3:09:26] you are not going to leave, daddy, are
[3:09:29] you?" And I looked at her little old fat
[3:09:34] leg and her little crimple
[3:09:39] hand. Yeah. because of the sickness.
[3:09:43] Yes, the leg was fat, the hand was
[3:09:47] crippled, holding like that as she was
[3:09:50] drawing,
[3:09:51] quivering. And she was looking at me,
[3:09:54] little old lips
[3:09:56] quivering. I said, Sharon, are you going
[3:09:59] to leave,
[3:10:00] daddy? And looked like she was quivering
[3:10:03] so like she looked up at
[3:10:07] me. She was suffering so hard.
[3:10:11] till one of those little baby eyes, her
[3:10:13] little eyes was crossed like
[3:10:18] that looked at her
[3:10:21] suffering. She was looked like she was
[3:10:23] trying to reach her little
[3:10:26] hand and it just tore my heart.
[3:10:32] I thought oh
[3:10:34] god from that day that's the reason
[3:10:38] cross eye
[3:10:40] children just can't stand to look at
[3:10:43] them brother Brham in all his
[3:10:46] ministry he would look at a crosseyed
[3:10:50] child and heal her
[3:10:54] immediately some didn't even have
[3:10:57] eyes because of what he went
[3:11:00] through and it made
[3:11:02] invulnerable. She would look at that
[3:11:05] person and one time he prayed and eyes
[3:11:08] popped
[3:11:14] up. See her little eyes was crossed like
[3:11:19] that. You know, God does those things.
[3:11:24] He has to crush
[3:11:27] something to get the good out of
[3:11:30] it and the prophet was being
[3:11:34] crushed so he can become a man of
[3:11:38] God. I seen that little
[3:11:42] thing I kneel down on the floor and I
[3:11:46] said, "Oh, dear God, I'm sorry that I
[3:11:48] did what I did.
[3:11:52] You took my wife, my darling away from
[3:11:56] me. Now you are taking my baby. Oh
[3:12:00] God, please don't take my little
[3:12:03] girl. I love her with all my heart. I
[3:12:07] said I'll serve you. I've done all I
[3:12:10] know to do except I did not go when you
[3:12:14] told
[3:12:15] me. I said please don't take my baby. I
[3:12:20] said I love her and no please tell me
[3:12:24] God. I said take me instead
[3:12:29] of this is a man who God is
[3:12:33] training to be
[3:12:36] vulnerable. If you don't accept to be
[3:12:39] vulnerable by the word, God will allow
[3:12:44] situation to come and train you.
[3:12:50] as I raise I'm I'm showing you here
[3:12:52] these things happened before the
[3:12:54] international ministry
[3:12:58] brother and that's why brotherham was
[3:13:01] the most humble servant of
[3:13:09] God and everyone
[3:13:12] else talked about the humility of
[3:13:26] to tell the story. Don't interret tell
[3:13:27] the story so people can follow. Amen. So
[3:13:29] as I raised my eyes,
[3:13:31] I looked like a black it looked like a
[3:13:33] black sheet coming
[3:13:38] unfolded. I know she was going
[3:13:42] there. So I raised up and looked at
[3:13:45] her. I said, "God bless you,
[3:13:47] honey." I said, "Your daddy's
[3:13:50] darling." I laid my hand over her head.
[3:13:53] I said, "Oh God," I said, "I don't know
[3:13:56] why you are tearing me up like
[3:13:58] this." But I said, "Still that doesn't
[3:14:02] change my faith in
[3:14:05] you." And I said, "A job of
[3:14:18] God be with you,
[3:14:19] honey. In a few minutes, the angels will
[3:14:23] come and pack your soul to
[3:14:25] mother. I'll pick you up from
[3:14:28] here. I will pick you up from here and
[3:14:32] lay you in mother's arms and bury you to
[3:14:34] God. I said, Lord, I've done all I can.
[3:14:39] It's not my will
[3:14:41] now that thy will be done. I laid my
[3:14:44] hand on her little head like
[3:14:47] that. I couldn't hold myself no more. I
[3:14:51] felt myself slinking and went down to
[3:14:53] the
[3:14:56] floor. If God wants to humble you, he
[3:14:58] can humble
[3:15:00] you. Listen to me. You who is running
[3:15:03] away from his
[3:15:04] presence. God can humble you. And don't
[3:15:08] make a mistake of you thinking I'm
[3:15:09] scaring you
[3:15:11] today. I'm giving you a a principle of
[3:15:14] the
[3:15:15] word. If God is interested in
[3:15:18] you, he will do anything to humble
[3:15:23] you. But don't let him do
[3:15:27] it because the way he does it, you will
[3:15:30] never love it. I felt myself slinking
[3:15:34] and I went down to the floor.
[3:15:37] The angels of God come picked
[3:15:39] her and took her little soul away. Her
[3:15:42] little mouth quit
[3:15:44] quivering and her little legs
[3:15:46] straightened
[3:15:47] out. God taken her away. And I stood
[3:15:51] there, my heart mashed
[3:15:53] pieces. God loves a broken
[3:15:57] heart. God broke
[3:15:59] it. Don't let God break
[3:16:04] it. But I thought
[3:16:06] Oh
[3:16:07] God, oh mercy, I said, Lord,
[3:16:12] why don't you just take me
[3:16:14] long when I was a
[3:16:17] kid? Everybody laughed at me. They
[3:16:21] called me
[3:16:22] I went
[3:16:24] hungry and I went without and everything
[3:16:27] else. Here it comes out to a place. You
[3:16:30] give me a little
[3:16:31] home. I try to live right. Then you give
[3:16:35] me a little home. Don't take it away
[3:16:38] from me. Go let me go with them. I said
[3:16:44] don't let me stay
[3:16:45] here. I don't want to stay. I cried and
[3:16:49] lifted up my hands to him. I said but
[3:16:52] down in my heart
[3:16:56] there something. I love
[3:16:59] you. No matter what you have done, I
[3:17:02] love you Lord.
[3:17:04] I lift up my hand my my hands to
[3:17:07] him. So the nurse come in looked at the
[3:17:11] baby and crossed his little
[3:17:13] hand. She come and picked me up went
[3:17:17] out. Few days later we took her up there
[3:17:21] on the hill. Brother Smith the Methodist
[3:17:24] preacher standing there preaching the
[3:17:26] funeral. When they went out to lower her
[3:17:29] down with the mother man, I looked at
[3:17:30] her.
[3:17:34] He got some old uh clothes of of dirt in
[3:17:37] his
[3:17:43] hand and I saw that I couldn't stand
[3:17:48] it. Little By Paul was leaning on my arm
[3:17:51] [Music]
[3:17:53] here, 18 months
[3:17:55] old. And he goes ahead to tell the story
[3:17:59] of how Billy Billy poor
[3:18:04] didn't know what was
[3:18:07] happening. But then he
[3:18:09] said, "There's a land beyond the
[3:18:13] river that they call a street
[3:18:17] forever. We only reach that shore by
[3:18:20] faith
[3:18:22] decree. One by one we gained a
[3:18:25] portal there to dwell with a mortal."
[3:18:29] Someday the ring has gold and
[3:18:32] bell for you and
[3:18:35] me. I will turn out from the
[3:18:38] grave. It became real to
[3:18:41] him. He became really
[3:18:44] vulnerable. When God told him go, he
[3:18:47] went.
[3:18:49] When God told him
[3:18:51] stop because the gift God gave
[3:18:54] him needed him to be sensitive to the
[3:18:56] spirit.
[3:19:00] Yes. He had to be an o obedient
[3:19:04] man. One time it was somewhere you know
[3:19:08] the plane was grounded and the Holy
[3:19:11] Spirit told him now move. He moved.
[3:19:14] Turn. He turn. He turn. And then he
[3:19:17] found a sick dying
[3:19:20] child. First of all, he understood what
[3:19:22] it means for a mother to lose a
[3:19:26] child. Secondly, understood what it is
[3:19:28] to obey
[3:19:30] God. He was
[3:19:32] vulnerable. He was weak and ready to
[3:19:35] hear and
[3:19:37] obey. Brother, sister, that is
[3:19:42] Christianity. Have a soft heart for
[3:19:45] God. God chose to use brother
[3:19:48] Bannon. First of all, he was born from a
[3:19:50] poor
[3:19:52] body. First of all, he was first fell
[3:19:54] sick. He almost
[3:19:57] died. He wrote that
[3:20:00] stanza though I have
[3:20:03] suffered in many a
[3:20:06] way. What's the next word? I cried for
[3:20:09] my
[3:20:10] healing because he was sick in the
[3:20:13] hospital. He was almost dying.
[3:20:16] Both night and
[3:20:17] day, faith wasn't
[3:20:20] forgotten by the
[3:20:23] father. You know, he wrote this that
[3:20:27] stanza, gave me a
[3:20:29] sign on the wings of
[3:20:32] death. He knew what he was talking
[3:20:35] about. Oh, we need people who are so
[3:20:38] vulnerable. They will write song that
[3:20:41] they write be inspired to preach. the
[3:20:44] whisper to sing, the whisper to
[3:20:47] play by
[3:20:50] revelation by
[3:20:52] vulnerability. You will come to
[3:20:55] church by
[3:20:57] vulnerability. You will
[3:21:00] know you don't have to say after all
[3:21:02] they have called us what will I do. No,
[3:21:06] you because you're drawn to
[3:21:10] God. He once felt sick, almost died. He
[3:21:12] felt
[3:21:14] He felt everything but strong and able.
[3:21:17] He was very
[3:21:20] weak. God reduced him to
[3:21:23] nothing. He fell down and cried like a
[3:21:26] baby. He was a man that was truly
[3:21:29] vulnerable before the presence of
[3:21:32] [Music]
[3:21:34] God. I'm sorry for taking time today,
[3:21:36] but this is a very important
[3:21:38] question. By the time left that
[3:21:42] place, God took him out. He took him to
[3:21:46] the whole
[3:21:47] world. Amen. Tens of millions of
[3:21:52] people were saved and healed and
[3:21:55] delivered because this was a servant
[3:21:57] humble obey
[3:22:00] obedience. Many times when you suffer
[3:22:03] things, it's because you are not
[3:22:05] vulnerable.
[3:22:09] And God is interested in you. He wants
[3:22:13] to use you. And with God, it doesn't
[3:22:16] matter how long it
[3:22:19] takes with Moses. It took 40
[3:22:23] years until Moses became vulnerable. He
[3:22:26] said, "Now God, I'm
[3:22:28] ready." Not ready because he felt
[3:22:30] wanting to
[3:22:32] do. God hears that cry of I'm
[3:22:35] ready. When you say I cannot do
[3:22:40] [Music]
[3:22:43] anything, I am useless. When you feel
[3:22:47] that, it's time for God to use you. So
[3:22:50] God choose to use
[3:22:52] David. He was a man that was really
[3:22:56] vulnerable. He opened up his
[3:22:59] heart before the
[3:23:01] Lord in every
[3:23:04] situation. when he was
[3:23:07] angry, when he was
[3:23:09] sinful, when he was mad at
[3:23:12] God, when he felt, he always opened
[3:23:16] up. Said, "Oh, God, search me from the
[3:23:19] inward
[3:23:21] parts. He he would speak things that no
[3:23:25] one would even dare
[3:23:27] speak." And on Wednesday, I'll continue.
[3:23:31] There's much more talk about it. But
[3:23:33] friends, I tell you, may God help you,
[3:23:36] help me, help all of
[3:23:39] us to break down in the presence of the
[3:23:42] Holy Spirit.
[3:23:45] It's a gift when you have
[3:23:47] it. It's a blessing when you have it.
[3:23:50] when you can sing a song
[3:23:52] and you just break down in his presence.
[3:23:56] You know when when when you you're not
[3:23:58] singing out to just sing but you're
[3:24:00] singing out because something has been
[3:24:03] made personal for
[3:24:10] you. Shall we stand on our
[3:24:15] feet? Hallelujah.
[3:24:30] Hallelujah. May God help us and restore
[3:24:32] that old time religion to us.
[3:24:43] I think
[3:24:44] brother Amram, you always sing that
[3:24:46] song. Can you help us sing that first
[3:24:48] stance
[3:24:50] again? And he says, "No one knew how
[3:24:52] alone I was
[3:24:57] feeling and the emptiness I tried so
[3:25:00] hard to
[3:25:03] hide." God just led
[3:25:06] brotherh brother Iranius to sing
[3:25:09] that just at the right time. Although I
[3:25:13] laughed and said my life was fine
[3:25:14] without you.
[3:25:18] I was covering
[3:25:21] up the secret tears as I
[3:25:24] cried. It's time to bring them
[3:25:27] out. It's time to no longer cover
[3:25:31] up. Then one day someone told me of your
[3:25:35] mercy and the love you showed on a
[3:25:39] hill. There you
[3:25:42] die and purchase my redemption. when you
[3:25:45] broke sin's
[3:25:47] power and set my spirit
[3:25:50] free. I pray that you will do that for
[3:25:52] someone else.
[3:25:55] Amen. Help me, brother. Help me. Help me
[3:25:56] sing it. That first stanza. Hallelujah.
[3:26:00] If you have the words, brother, give it
[3:26:02] to us. Let us all try to sing them if we
[3:26:05] can. I
[3:26:08] knew how
[3:26:10] alone I was.
[3:26:15] Yes, Lord.
[3:26:18] And the
[3:26:20] emptyness I tried so much to.
[3:26:25] [Music]
[3:26:30] Oh, I laughed and said my life was
[3:26:36] finally without you.
[3:26:42] I was covering
[3:26:44] up the
[3:26:47] sacred
[3:26:51] Jesus. And one
[3:26:55] day told
[3:26:58] me your mercy.
[3:27:02] Yes, Lord.
[3:27:07] want to
[3:27:09] heal Calvary.
[3:27:16] There
[3:27:19] you punches my redemption.
[3:27:28] When you broke sinless
[3:27:31] power and set my spirit
[3:27:37] freeing
[3:27:39] now I'm
[3:27:45] amaz that that you love me.
[3:27:49] [Music]
[3:27:51] I'm a
[3:27:54] [Applause]
[3:27:56] man that you
[3:28:02] gave. Through your
[3:28:06] graious
[3:28:08] blood, I found
[3:28:12] my s
[3:28:15] [Music]

[3:29:49] is stronger. I will learn that your love
[3:29:53] is stronger than my weakness. And your
[3:29:58] ear is open every time I pray. And your
[3:30:01] ear is open every time I pray.

[3:30:14] me. For me like
[3:30:17] you. Yes, Lord. Other friends would
[3:30:23] never be as close to

[3:55:41] I give myself. I give myself. I give
[3:55:45] myself.
[3:55:46] I give myself.
[3:55:50] [Music]
[3:55:52] Friends, I want to tell you something
[3:55:54] [Music]
[3:55:57] today. While we are in his presence,
[3:56:03] You
[3:56:05] [Music]
[3:56:07] see
[3:56:10] brokenness comes from two
[3:56:13] things. You can never force yourself to
[3:56:16] be
[3:56:18] broken. It is
[3:56:21] impossible. But you see brokenness comes
[3:56:24] from two
[3:56:27] things. It can come from one of them.
[3:56:31] [Music]
[3:56:32] It can come from hearing the
[3:56:35] word. When you hear the word and you
[3:56:37] open your
[3:56:39] heart and then he convicts
[3:56:42] you, that brings
[3:56:46] brokenness, makes you cry out to
[3:56:49] him, makes you worship him, makes you
[3:56:52] break out in a
[3:56:54] worship, in
[3:56:57] repentance, in tears, in crying out.
[3:57:01] But if it doesn't come from
[3:57:03] that, then it can come from a broken
[3:57:07] heart. We've seen a man I've read for
[3:57:10] you
[3:57:11] here that had a broken
[3:57:14] heart, things he went
[3:57:17] through
[3:57:19] broken. I don't know about you. I would
[3:57:22] not want to go through
[3:57:25] things to get
[3:57:27] broken. I would want at the hearing of
[3:57:29] his
[3:57:31] word to open my heart and listen to the
[3:57:35] voice of the
[3:57:37] spirit and let him break
[3:57:39] me. Let him mold
[3:57:42] me. Let him make me a man, a woman I
[3:57:45] want to
[3:57:48] [Music]
[3:57:51] be. Even as we leave this
[3:57:55] place, I want you to meditate about what
[3:57:58] you have
[3:57:59] heard and ask
[3:58:01] [Music]
[3:58:03] him. Spend time in
[3:58:06] prayer. It's a sacrifice you have to
[3:58:09] make. Find
[3:58:11] time every day. Each of
[3:58:15] us, we should find time every
[3:58:18] day and and be in communication with the
[3:58:21] Lord.
[3:58:24] This cultivates
[3:58:27] brokenness. You just have to be
[3:58:29] vulnerable in his
[3:58:30] [Music]
[3:58:33] presence. Don't worry about the state
[3:58:35] you are
[3:58:36] in. Whatever state you are in, you
[3:58:39] approach him the way you
[3:58:41] are. He will always
[3:58:44] understand. Let me pray for you. Maybe
[3:58:48] you want say I I need prayer.
[3:58:51] This was for me. I need
[3:58:53] prayer. Maybe those of you at the
[3:58:56] altar, just let him know your need. Open
[3:58:59] up your
[3:59:01] heart. Wherever you are, just
[3:59:04] lift. Let us pray
[3:59:07] together. Oh, Holy
[3:59:10] Spirit, loving
[3:59:12] Jesus. We love you, Lord.
[3:59:16] Many times Lord we are carried away by
[3:59:21] things. We are carried away by
[3:59:25] circumstances. But Lord we have heard
[3:59:27] today.
[3:59:29] You would take away what you had given
[3:59:31] to one
[3:59:33] man and you would give it to
[3:59:36] another. Because this man had a heart
[3:59:38] like
[3:59:41] thine. This was a heart which was
[3:59:43] willing to say Lord I'm sorry.
[3:59:47] A heart which was willing to cry out to
[3:59:50] you. A heart which was willing to say
[3:59:52] created
[3:59:54] me. Renew a right spirit within
[3:59:58] me. Take your holy spirit not away from
[4:00:02] me. treat me with high
[4:00:06] Lord, a heart which was willing to cry
[4:00:11] out and say, I wet my pillows at
[4:00:17] night. I cry
[4:00:19] out because I'm desperate for
[4:00:23] you. To the people of the world, that is
[4:00:28] weakness. But to you, that is strength.
[4:00:31] He said to this man, "Will I
[4:00:34] look that has a broken heart and a
[4:00:37] contrite
[4:00:39] spirit? Help me,
[4:00:42] Lord. Help me, Lord
[4:00:44] Jesus. That I will also be more
[4:00:48] sincere, that I'll not preach to others
[4:00:50] and I lose it
[4:00:53] myself. Oh, help me,
[4:00:56] Jesus. Help all the ministers here,
[4:00:58] Lord. Help every brother, every
[4:01:02] sister that we may not miss it
[4:01:05] Lord. It may not become usual
[4:01:09] unc. But this will be something that we
[4:01:12] crave
[4:01:14] afterward to be in your
[4:01:17] presence,
[4:01:19] vulnerable in your
[4:01:22] presence where we can find a a spot and
[4:01:24] we go out and cry out to you.

[4:01:41] confused many commit suicide many go
[4:01:44] into a

[4:01:48] anxiety make wrong
[4:01:50] decisions help us Jesus that we will
[4:01:53] become vulnerable before you will tell
[4:01:56] you exactly what we feel and how we
[4:01:59] feel because you are our solution every
[4:02:03] time. You have solution for us every
[4:02:06] time we come before you.
[4:02:08] Lord, have your way Lord
[4:02:11] Jesus do not reject us but receive us
[4:02:15] father as we come with an open
[4:02:18] heart. Grant I pray

[4:05:58] are not joining another church.
[4:06:01] No, you are you're
[4:06:06] interpreting. You are you are getting
[4:06:09] born into the body of
[4:06:12] Christ. Like your church is not joined.
[4:06:17] a denomination, a religion you can
[4:06:20] join. But the true church of
[4:06:22] Jesus is a family. You are born into it.
[4:06:27] And you become a member of
[4:06:29] that by the Holy
[4:06:32] Spirit. So you've repented,
[4:06:35] you are going to
[4:06:38] baptize, and now God promised he will
[4:06:40] feed you with the Holy
[4:06:42] Spirit. Now when you receive
[4:06:44] him from that moment you are born into
[4:06:48] the
[4:06:48] body. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[4:06:51] so you are in a journey and we want to
[4:06:53] say to welcome you.

[4:07:04] today. But you were always a part of
[4:07:07] him. We were always a part of
[4:07:10] him. Let us give a hand to our
[4:07:14] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. God bless
[4:07:19] you all.

[4:08:34] a testimony?
[4:08:37] [Music]
[4:08:47] God bless you
[4:08:50] brethren. I've come to thank God for two
[4:08:54] issues and even to testify.
[4:09:00] I thank God when this last week was
[4:09:04] starting. We have a young person we work
[4:09:07] with at the
[4:09:09] shop. The woman who serves tea brought
[4:09:12] tea to
[4:09:15] him and the child poured the tea on on
[4:09:22] himself. Child has been bedridden so
[4:09:24] badly off.
[4:09:28] for seven days. But God has had mercy on
[4:09:30] us. The baby is getting
[4:09:34] better. The second miracle God did for
[4:09:36] me
[4:09:39] yesterday. Thieves came and stole my
[4:09:42] phone at my
[4:09:45] workplace. I wanted to rush and do it my
[4:09:47] way.
[4:09:53] But let alone I went to the room where
[4:09:55] we keep our
[4:09:56] money and I said
[4:09:59] Lord I can do this on my own but you
[4:10:02] have the eye. You have the
[4:10:06] eye which saw the person who took my
[4:10:08] phone and you know where they
[4:10:10] are. They say Lord tell that person to
[4:10:13] bring it
[4:10:15] back. Brethren, somebody brought the
[4:10:17] phone
[4:10:18] [Applause]
[4:10:19] back after 3 hours with the phone. They
[4:10:24] brought the phone back. I thank God's
[4:10:31] [Music]
[4:10:34] grace. And I told the thieves he had
[4:10:37] taken a born again his phone, but God
[4:10:39] caught you and told you to bring it
[4:10:42] back. And I told him, I won't do
[4:10:44] anything. you go back. It was God who
[4:10:46] touched you.
[4:10:48] I thank
[4:10:51] God. God bless you.
[4:10:54] When you have when you become vulnerable
[4:10:56] in his
[4:10:58] presence, things are done and be I have
[4:11:02] money. Then you go to police and you
[4:11:06] track. When you can do nothing and you
[4:11:09] go before his presence, things are done.
[4:11:14] Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you for that
[4:11:18] testimony. Father will lead us in the
[4:11:20] songs as we
[4:11:22] dismiss. We meet on Wednesday. We can
[4:11:25] greet one another. Shalom.
