[Music] Hallelujah me I'm happy Hallelujah yes I'm happy to see most of you smil how many appreciate brother Prince praise the Lord now I just have a few announcements to give to you uh uh regarding after the service we having a minister meeting I mean if you you know you carry any office it will be like a little service just have things on my heart to speak to [Music] you the deons school super the teachers the music department other departments all of you ministers you know we shall be meeting after the we shall be having another short service after this service and also we have an invitation here from speckled Ministries they're inviting us to go uh for for Easter meetings get which will begin on Thursday evening 28th March and the arrival will be at uh 4 p.m. on on that Thursday and the meetings will go on up to uh first April so that is Monday and they're saying uh they have invited speakers Brother Joseph greenen from the USA I actually actually happen to have been in touch with him Joseph Green has a great burden for missionary work and I told him I would not be around I I know I'm also going to be in Switzerland during the same time there is other Easter meetings there so brother Daniel and Brother David invited me to go and be a part of those so Brother Joseph was telling me that one of his uh ministers will be in those meetings so I'll meet one of his ministers and you will be uh attending these meetings where Brother Joseph will be preaching so then also brother kith raid from Jama um yeah so basically I think the I saw other ministers but uh so they're saying that if you are going to go uh you should carry personal effects including cups plates beds open and uh the camp will be 30,000 uh if you're planning to attend those meetings throughout there's a c fee to that that would be 30,000 the venue isri school so Endeavor to be in those meetings I was discussing about the Martin of course usually when you have meetings like this not everybody goes to to the meetings and also uh even when many go sometimes you have visitors and so we will we will have our our we will cancel all the other services but we shall have our morning noral noral morning service that will be let me pick up the dates that will be 3 31st March so we shall have one service in the morning on Sunday but the Friday service will be cancelled because we believe that everybody should be there as well and then Saturday everybody should be there then Sunday morning we shall have our normal morning service and after that you can again go back so I believe it will be a wonderful time amen during the time as I already have informed me informed you I con your prayers I'll be a way to swizerland and I believe that uh I will also be blessed there and my being there will also be a blessing amen uh I appreciate the land contribution uh contributions I heard I think the brother made a mistake said this week we were better than last week but I think this week we have declined a little bit I'm looking around for brother Andrew do you have the F the treasure do F I just wanted to clarify that bit uh can I can I have it so this is this week this is last week okay the reason I think the reason for that is what we announced here on Sunday last Sunday was less by 50,000 and that was because one of the groups gave us a wrong amount which is why uh team leaders we have engaged the new way of reporting and using these files which we gave to you and so based on that I see that this week has been better than last week but what we announced was a wrong amount it was less by 50,000 because one one group gave us a wrong amount so I see many groups have declined as much as we have been better than last week I uh I hope when we do the ministers meeting we will meet the groups shortly leers so that we we can hear their problems and their concerns we should not Tire this is a goal which is is attainable and we believe we are going to attain can I hear your amens if you we are going to attain it nothing will derail us or stop us we are going to pursue it nonetheless I appreciate all the givers God bless you amen uh shall we stand on our feet I have a a very uh important subject to share with with the child very important to you very important to us as a church as individuals the approach I may I may take today not many take that kind of approach in the message and so bear with me this morning and pray for me because I feel this is of utmost urgency and importance to us to learn these things and God just gave me a confirmation as I was streaming in my study as I was streaming this morning uh I heard what was the Sunday School report can I have it brother Prince do you have the Sunday School report Sunday school I I sister Fe came to me last night told me to teaching Sunday school and so I connected with brother with the superintendant and I did not even know what she was going to speak but I was surprised when I heard the report I'll give him a moment because it is important thank you amen uh the topic was reaping what you saw I don't know the details yet I was not there but I will tell you what I'm going to minister on this morning I'm going to speak on the principle of sowing and so in in the Sunday School church we did not know what they were going to talk about but we are in the same Spirit God is God is intending to uh to speak to us on that subject so today we're talking about sewing and we're talking about the principle of sewing you know I I I gave a text to uh to brother cosmas now is I've never heard you will forgive me I've never heard of any minister or any believe of the message I'm just giving a comment I've never heard who believes that so I asked him a question I said uh I I said brother cosmas do you believe in the principle of SE Faith well this is after I had gotten the inspiration to speak on this where he said I I absolutely do it is a Biblical principle praise the name of the Lord and the reason why I had to read that text is because uh this is someone that has beli it and experienced it and it has worked actually he goes on to say it brings results and so I want I would like if I love you as a as as a church as you know the people that the Lord has given to be Minister and I know something that is going to better your life I'm going to give it to you now it will be up to you to apply it this service I'm requesting that you really give me your undivided attention and you pray for me also that the Lord will speak to us today shall we just have humble ourselves for prayer father Lord um many things before me here the devil has not wanted me to speak about this for Lord many many months at one point months ago I I felt aned to speak on this subject but I did not know the approach to you I I I I was still Desiring to hear from you and your leadership of and father Lord meeting by the cosmas it just got St up in me once again and going down to study it and Desiring to see the word of God about [Music] this I see that this is in the midd of your word I pray Lord that you will help me give me inspiration anoint me and also the people that are hearing me this morning and even many many who might hear this later on Lord may they not be confused but may they be inspired and may they receive understanding that they will know what it is that they ought to do to be able to attain your promises father give the service to you the reading of your word give the people inspiration as well to receive in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and uh we are opening 2 Corinthians chapter 9 uh before I also forget uh the the next weekend that will be uh the first Sunday of March the Lord willing we are going to have brother Kennedy from Nairobi uh going to come and speak for us so we we should pray that the Lord will will give Inspire him to come and bless us second Corinthians chapter 9 vers six and vers s so I have a lot of hair on my Fork it may be a little while I usually don't want to go beyond 1 hour and a half but there are certain someons I don't want also to break into two parts so this is one of them if you give me youred attention I promise you I won't be long so let us read in Jesus name but this I say he which sth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he also which sth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as he purpose say in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful giver and God is able to make all grace abound toward you that he always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he has dispersed he has dispersed abroad he has given to the poor his righteousness remaineth forever [Music] [Music] for now he that Minister SE to the Ser both Minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness [Music] so it is him that give gives the seed and it is him that multiplies the SE or the increase thereof and so I want us to remember that before we go any further it is him God who gives the seed and it is him who gives the [Music] increase but it is you makes a decision to give God bless you you may have your and I'm also going to read from third John 1 verse 2 I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul pro prospereth a little [Music] two we we in third John brother chapter 1 verse amen amen I know the preacher comes he has inspiration knows where going but The Interpreter must also enter into that same inspiration pray for him amen praise the Lord how many are ready to receive from H you know you will notice that uh of late I've been going a little bit deeper to bring some principles to you to teach you a little bit and so bear with me of course I'm not a teacher so even when I go to teaching I am all over the place but God has a way of by the Holy Spirit taking out what he wants you to hear to make the word real to you so we are now speaking on the principle of and certainly the principle of sowing and repping and so um in the message we have not emphasized or spoken about this not because we do not believe it but because it is a minor and while I will go into it before I do that let us first read a little bit about what a minor is in the message Prophet 196 he says div Divine Healing is a minor in the gospel and you can never measure on a mind that's why in the message of the hour we measure on a measure the measure is the Salvation of the soul but you see it's not the only thing that is in the gospel in the Pentecostal World they have measured on a minor and what is the minor we'll find out he says Divine Healing also is a minor it's a bait that is used to get people to believe in the Supernatural presence the Supernatural is present and then by that if they can recognize his presence then they are healed see Listen by faith believing it now the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God you know everything is by faith believing by Faith by faith you know salvation by faith without faith it is impossible to please God so everything is really by faith even this principle that I'm talking to you today about it can only be applied in your life by faith and I want you to remember that as well and so he says in the message is Faith Express now A gift just like I said last night a gift is wonderful but you can't base your Eternal destination on gifts please hear me now you cannot Maj on a minor and a gift is a minor and sat can any gift that God is he can make something just exactly like therefore we have got to watch all these are minor and callings you know a man of God with a gift of healing with a gift of vision miracles signs and wonders you know prophecies all these things are gifts and minor now not that they but they minor they're not the majors I don't know yes maybe I don't know you will find the right word as we go so you see it is a minor and uh we talk about prosperity and the blessings of God are you following me it's a minor well if you want to learn you you you you you say Amen so all these things are Min in the go it's not the major thing in the Bible the major thing in the Bible is the Salvation and prosperity of the soul that is what will take us to Heaven if you are not healed you can still go to heaven if you are not rich you can still go to heaven are you hearing me if you have never seen any Mir in your life as long as you are saved you can still go to heaven if you have never seen the dead raised you you are saved in your soul you will still go to heaven you know so in other words all these other blessings Prosperity signs and wonders gifts and calling they are the miners of the Gospel we do not best on that to go in the Raptor whether you are poor or Rich you will go in the as long as you a beli of the word are you following me but now because of that we have found that in the message we have a lot of people living defeated lives even here in the church many of us struggling struggling financially struggling in your marriage struggling in your school everything about you is struggle and you know even when we come to church you know we we don't tell you how you can break out and when anybody tries to tell you we fear as preachers we feel that when we talk about it other preachers will say we are now becoming Pentecostal because we are preaching Pentecostal teaching I don't to be talked about I I don't want you to struggle I don't want you to live defeated life I want to give you principles in the word of God will help you to prosper in the physical things as in the spiritual things well of course if you're poor you can still go to heaven but I don't want to go to a poor man in this Bible we read we find one man who was rich amen and and he went to heaven that is Abraham he was very rich because he followed oh hallelujah oh God help me to teach he followed this PR and he was rich and he went to heaven and you find another one his name was Lazarus he was a Begg he was a poor man and he also went to so both of them were in heaven one rich one poor and then another one went to who was actually rich so rich has don't take it to heaven and when this man was in hell he wanted you know some water and he looked he looks across the dimension and he said I need a little more little Qui of my sound the sound is okay but that's the quality so then he when he looked across the dimension he said Father Abraham I need some water he said ah there is a big can't you tell Lazarus just dip his finger in other words he still thought he can undermine Laz because I think because he knew I don't want to be remembered as someone who was very poor very beg even those in Hell our Prophet says the way you die is the way you'll be there nothing changes you just change destination that is deep that is deep but I'll not take it any further I will follow my thought here so in other words whether you poor or Rich you will go to heaven so if it's about going to the Rapture just believe the word of the hour you will make it amen you will make it but today I am not preaching to you about going to the rap at least for this service today let me teach you how to make it in life let me teach you how to prosper in this life whereby you will support the work of God whereby you will be a head and not a whereby you will be a prosperous person where you will be called a son a daughter of prosperity whereby you will give and not not not not borrow these are all Bible principles he says you shall you shall borrow but you will not you will not Lear you will not borrow that's what the Bible says you will borrow to the Nations my God is this the Bible we believe so why is it that especially here in Africa we pray so much but the more we are praying the more poor we become does it mean the god of the Bible does not answer us he answers others the problem is only one we do not know or teach principle of so the Pentecostal who teach it so well they have become so prosperous because the principle works for anyone no they are prospered but they are sold is not secured but we in the message who have secured our soul we live defeated life so now I want to strike a balance today I can bring it to a place where you will you will fulfill the scripture beloved I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health even as th Soul that's the desire of God for you God doesn't want you to be safe but poor God wants you to be happy and also be if let us face it if you don't have resources in your your family even your marriage will be very hard life will be very hard you look at all those sisters they are very happy as long as they lubricated very well with money families that have more money as long as they have gold they happy I'm talking about Believers not because that they have the money but they have no joy they have no but even when you are Holy Ghost F but in the house the wife would say I want food and and you don't say I don't have money and Children Cry that the wife will be very tough that there will be no joy in the house there will be no joy in that family because they don't have enough resources and God does not want you to live like that if you don't have school fees you will not go to school right and you'll be sad all the time have gone but have not if you don't have school fees and they come to chase you even if you begin pray I break all the spirits of schol they will still chase you because they need money and even if you come and fast and pray for the whole day for money you not get it how many have F than prayed for money and they it never came no be honest be yes beere okay what about those ones when the preacher came here he said you can speak it and he said I want money mil and not come how many okay those who have raised and those who have been shy because you did not follow the principle praise the name of the Lord there is a principle to everything and the word of God has all answers the has all answers and and so we have come to a place where we have now as Believers completely neglected the Min El's Ministry remember was to restore all things so if if it restor the meure amen baptism in Jesus name teaching on one God should not be you know the order in the church and all these teachings about our hair that women should not cut their hair and men should cut their hair and our dressing should be holy and all things those are the measur of the world and Elijah's Ministry restored them also El minist restored all the miners of the world Hallelujah so we must know by the message of the hour amen amen to to know what the word of God actually says and speaks about sewing the principle of sowing and reaping amen how to become prosperous you start a business and in three weeks it is when everybody's crying economy is bad you are a Believer you also crying econom that's not right there is a problem because we must be head when others are crying econom is amen we must be crying we we don't know what you're talking about because we have another bank of Heaven amen our bank of Heaven amen does not require us to Amen to go the way of the world we have another way to be able to become prosperous my God are you hearing me now are you following me now actually the whole weekend that brother M was in Uganda he was teaching about this I don't know whether people actually got brother the prince came to me and he said to me I don't know whether people understood what he actually was saying Believers of the message we just love the word amen amen bye I'm going home when say let us give no those are worldly things and I don't even have money we want I don't have for things I would even stop coming from chch because it is putting on pressure we have no understanding We are failing to prosper because we have no understanding of the pro of the principle of sewing whether you like me or not today I'm going to preach whether you call me Pentecost or not today I'm going to preach and because it is biblical it is scriptural and I want you to prosper because the work of God Must Go On I don't believe I should be beggar I have never believed in begging never in all my life I've never believed in it even when I had zero nothing I've never believed in actually I realized I was following this principle without even knowing it and this has made me what I am today because it works giving and sewing is one other Bible truth that we should never reject in the magean church age our Prophet say now this is nothing against rich [Music] people because God can serve a rich man some of God's children are rich now I want you to separate riches and prosperity okay I'm not saying that all of you should be rich not everybody is Rich even the B says not many reach are called but I'm talking about being prosperous in everything you do I'm talking about being in a position where you've got this where you can take care of your do you know that even the Bible says a man a man who has a home a husband a father who cannot take care of his children he is even worse than an Infidel an infid is someone who does not believe so which means father if you can't take care of your home you not even go in the rapt that is how it is serious you are worse than an INF who says that is no God you are worse than that so now it means God wants you to be in a position where you are in control of your life where you run your life according to the principles of God many people want to rely on others that's why people do bad things in this life because everybody wants to rely on another one and the person giving you money will tell you to do things that you don't like to do but because of the money they're giving you you have a rope on your neck so you are servant even the Bible says that a borrower is a slave to the ler someone borrows you money you become their slaves that's why Believers if they follow this principle they should not borrow they should be able to land it's a Bible principle according to the word of God I have never seen Abraham going to Sodom to borrow but why does he borrow why do we borrow today being children of Abraham because we don't follow the principle that he follow and we do not receive the results he received so some of God's children are rich there are those that are rich but even if you are not rich if you follow this principle you can never be poor if you follow this princi you will have enough for you and your family enough to give others you have enough to support the work of God but why are you always crying you're always the one who is saying you don't have because you don't follow this princip of sowing because money can be a snare maybe if a preacher is listening to me today may like be careful on this subject money can be a snare some people actually fear money people fear money God me don't give me money I want to stay away from it as as I can that's your faith receive it according to your faith it depends on what is in your hand and others when they see money they Jo for and the Sal begins to come because to them is their God money is paper to you it's not what it's not about the paper it's about the means to attain your purpose in life if God tells you you you are going to do ABCD God must give you the means to do it and that means is not what you worship what you worship is the god that makes it possible and listen whoever wants to do something for God God will give you the means let me tell you that means will come to you in form of a seed and you have to plant that seed in order for it to come for and bring a lot of result but what do we do we eat seed that's what we do we eat seed we don't care it is difficult this is very little how can I give it God knows it is enough for me let me die at least let me have this and die and God says okay that's all you will have that's all you will have you've eaten your seed you will not Prosper but a wise man a wise woman will take his SE and plant it in good ground and when you plant your seed your seed will germinate will spring up and your seed will bring forth much fruit and he will flourish and prosper not many Believers will like me after I preach this but my real children will love me and this thing will work in their lives after I preach this and after you practice it and you don't get the result then I I'm a false prophet and I will stop preaching but if you practice this the whole world will see that it is the truth not because I preached it because the word of God but money can be such a snare yeah is a snare not only to those that who have it but also to those who don't have it don't say I don't want to get near money it will compromise me even when you don't have money you will be compromised because you don't have money we have seen people getting into big Temptations because they poor even preachers many of them can tell lies in order to get money even preachers many of them can preach a first because they are poor but let me tell you our Prophet says here money is a snare not only to those who have it but even to those who don't have it so it's not about money actually John wiy preached about money and he said make your friend yourselves friends of mmon that's what he saying it is a scripture in the bible make your friend yourself friends of M that even after you have failed will deliver you into Everlasting so it's not about the money it's about what money can do so to us we are not going to pray oh God make me Rich we are going to do the principle and money will come anyhow and when money comes it's not about money it's about our purpose hallelujah hallelujah proverbs 30 vers s and n two things have I required of thee deny me them not before I die these are the words of a he says I request you of two things oh God don't refuse them give them to me one remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty no riches feed me with food convenient for me lest I be full and I deny thee and say who is the Lord or lest I be poor and I steal and take the name of my God in vain so if you poor you are not safe some Believers believe they are safe as long as they poor they will even tell you the Bible says it is very hard for a rich man inher the kingdom of God so now I I don't want to be rich I want to be poor if you don't want to be rich at least don't pray to be poor don't even desire to be poor but be desire to be prosperous 2 Corinthians 9:6 but this I say he which s sparing shall reap also sparing and he which sth bounti B every man according as in his heart let him give not grudgingly of necessity for God love a cheerful gift oh young people I pray that you stay in one place don't move move outside don't miss what I'm teaching you to because it will revolutionalize your life forever it will change you permanently some of you I'm telling you brothers and sisters all of you that are struggling fin if you listen to what I'm teaching today today I'm teaching something practical if you hear it and do it your life is going to change permanently so I want you to listen to me carefully I've never preached something like this before but I've studed the word and I'm convinced it is a Bible a Bible law a Bible scripture Bible teaching so Giver is a s tell your neighbor every Giver is a s every giving is so the law there is a law of the seed everything is Created from a seed there is nothing that is that was created out of no se you see you yourself you a SE from your father and you were planted Hallelujah you were planted somewhere and then you came out for and some of you are having children and some of you are being a blessing to your parents my mother today told me oh be careful about what you tell because up on theit she told me I have no driver today and I don't have enough transport transort so I'm leaving the car but I'm coming son and I'm coming with sever people I want you to take me back home how can I say no to my mother I'm a are you hearing me you are the fruit of your parents you are the increase so we are ourselves we are seed we are planted by our father oh and even more than that we are not the seed of our father we are the seat of the almighty God and we were planted down here on Earth to bring forth increase the man seed is planted forth to bring forth a child and even God himself he planted Jesus are you hearing me Jesus was a seed he planted Jesus in the Earth but what happened after he was planted he not stop there amen there were going to be many more signs that will come out of him he was a seed planted but out of that seed many more Sons will come out that's why the devil did not understand even when Jesus came on he thought he was a normal being not know he was a s when he killed him and he was bued he did not know when you bu a SE it comes out when you bu seed it will bring forth his kind and here we are we are the seed of God we had the increase that came out of the seed which was buried in the Jesus rose again I am the increase you are the increase hallelujah amen everything in the kingdom is based on seed every Harvest you want to see is dependent on your SE everything you want to see in your life it is about the seed so you must know what seed to plant for the harest you want to get what do you want in your life what do you want is the Harvest Right much of what we have been preaching and is Harvest receive your Harvest let me tell you you don't receive you have is like that you must s a seed not every seed the right kind of seed for the Harvest you intend to have you cannot s a seed in one acre and you expect to to to Reap is is dependent on the seed you saw Kingdom principles that simple everything is about sewing and ripping if you saw bitterness you reap bitterness if you saw hatred you reap hat are you hearing me CH if you saw amen Envy reap eny are you hearing me if you saw witchcraft you reap witchcraft if you saw fighting you fighting if you Mur you murder this is a kingdom PR whatever you saw shall you also if you saw prayer let me not get there yet praise the name of the Lord we are going to get there just give me a little time let me build this Genesis 8:20 let us go in the beginning we find out how seed how others planted seed this is After the flood now Genesis 820 please get there quickly uhuh and Noah build an altar unto the Lord and took of every clean beast and and of every clean fall and offered a burn offering on the altar Hallelujah this is after the FL oh Church me me please this is after the FL everything is gone if it is you and you are in a world which has nothing where do you begin from uhhuh tell me I'll show you here this is a man who happened to be on earth on the time when there was nothing the Bible says we come to the world with nothing it is up to you to stay in the world with nothing but to those that know the law and the principle of Soul they can never stay in the world with nothing the Bible says the world and the fullness there God is but how can we reap and from the from this Earth the principle is only one soul and here is a man who knew amen the right principle amen when it came to this time amen he he came out of the Ark and there was literally nothing and the Bible says he took of every clean Beast God never told him do it it was a revelation shwing is a revelation is a revelation you have to receive a revelation is what I'm going to do for the and he took out of every clean bis clean F and he offered burn offerings unto the Lord this man SW remember the principle is sewing is giving giving is sewing and this man sold Beast animals he gave offerings and the Lord oh are you hearing me now and the Lord smelled a [Music] sweet and the Lord said in his did you know that God God in his I Will Not Again cast the ground anymore for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will I against Smite any more thing living as I have done what God say this the man seed moved God said I will not again C The Ground meaning God was saying to to Noah today amen you're going to see increase from this Earth no more CES the Cur will not be amen will be removed because of your seed you are planted right and you're going to receive increase you're going to see all right Genesis 8:22 we continue while this is the same scripture I'm not cooking up stories this is your Bible please look at it while the Earth remain see the time and harvest everybody read after me read with me 1 2 3 go while that's 1% of you you should have your own Bible Brother Where is the scripture I just wanted to be sure you're following moving with me quickly we in Genesis 82 uhuh do you have the scripture brother Marvin is having an issue to come on all right everybody has your Bible okay 1 2 3 go while the Earth remaineth seed time and harvest time uh continue and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease after after no planted the offering he gave God was happy and he said from today I will no longer cast the ground from today I am telling you as long as the Earth remains SE time and harvest time will not cease there will be many seasons but SE time and harvest not Harvest Time Harvest yes thank you because Harvest comes from seed time we'll get to that listen when you decide now are you following me church when you decide it is SE time all right it is your decision no one tells you that's why we don't believe in this hogwash of pict telling people oh give a seed of 1 million that is thieves people stealing from people in the name of the Lord that's the wrong Prosperity teaching but allow me to teach you the right Prosperity Gospel you decide what to S nobody tells you nobody told Noah it was a decision however Harvest is not a decision it is a result of sewing hallelujah amen glory to God when you s you don't say Let Me Now wait for s for Harvest Time no Harvest will come it is not your decision God will make it happen God who is the OWN of this Earth the creator of this Earthen the one who brings forth Harvest will ensure that there will be Harvest there will be Harvest but the problem of it is many Christians they wait for Harvest where they did not s if you choose to S evil it will bear fruit of evil that's why I decided to always be sweet loving and kind even those who hate me and I'll tell you what it has always brought good fruit I'll tell you right here I I do not have bitterness in my heart about any living creature God knows my heart I love everybody even those who hate me you know it has done it has created me more love and more favor from people to the exent if someone wants to hit you they don't know how to start they don't know where to start you get my point if you saw love you will reap joy and love as if you saw good seed you will good oh my my my my my amen all right Hallelujah we on Galatians 6 I am not done I'm just beginning follow me S be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man s that shall he also reap for he that sth of his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption if you saw adultery and fornication you will reap HIV can I hear an amen whether the church catches you or not you will reap gor you will hi because you sold into your flesh corruption so you will reap corruption but if you live as a man of God a woman of God and you live holy oh let me tell you you will reap a joyful life if you saw a life of party what will you you will reting and death but if you saw woring God you are going to reap the blessing of God I'm becoming crazy with this but he that s the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life and let us not be wary in well dooing continue to do well even if when they Hur you do not H them back to be sweet the Bible says we are the salt of the earth the devil will not provoke me to the place where I saw bitterness I refuse to S bitterness I refuse to be angry I refuse to Envy somebody I refuse to hit somebody come on church I refuse to be a to commit witchcraft I refuse Amen to commit abortion IO sisters if you s into abortion you are going to reap bad Dreams and Nightmare help me I have night bad dreams when i s what did you my prayer cannot just simply take it the only way you can take it away is saw something else let us follow this principle and let us not be weary in well dooing for in season we shall reap F not as we have there opportunity did you know giving is an opportun did you know giving is an opportunity while I was studying this everything like many things became clear no wonder whenever I give something I'm so joyful inside because the sleeping is like the joy of a farmer when he SS and he has bed his SE in the ground he walks away expecting he's happy now what I've s after six month he could bring me this mon he can already begin saying I am rich I am rich because I've sold I have a farm of 50 acres and I have sold bountifully I've given much seed I'm expecting to reap bountifully it's a principle you can debate with him it will not remove the fact so there is no there's no there is no room for for you to with me on this and this is a sermon the kind of sermons I can tell you choose to do it or choose not to do it because if you don't do it you will still go to heaven are you hearing me but you will suffer much in this world because you will reap whatever you are sewing and we have there as we have there opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith if you are sowing brother so to everyone but especially the brothers and the sisters so to those ones because that ground is very good it will bring forth much increase because that brother will go and pray for you whenever you give something to amen say God bless you and God will increase you see me by the way I did not realize it until this morning sometimes I I was doing it unconsciously I've realized by way when I go back in my life 17 years of my I've realized suits has never been a problem to me but I've realized I've had a problem sometimes I want to buy suits suit I don't have money to buy them I look for the money I can't get but I've seen in the past things that I was doing unconsciously that whenever I took a brand new suit one of my suits I give to somebody another Minister brother this is yours I've realized I just always get other new suits in ways I never planned or imag so I can come here every Sunday with new I thinking money but you don't know where it is coming from I was sewing suits to somebody and i r amen by way of a miracle of myself getting new suits getting money I never plan to have and without even thinking I buy suits how does that happen it doesn't happen by osmosis it doesn't happen by accident so you try it and see I Dare You Church Believers of the message try it try it you will see what I'm talking about Hallelujah one day I had a sister sister after I got married you know she came to me she she told me a lot of issues her husband was not helping her and you know she was into a lot of trouble she couldn't afford you know even rent then God gave me Revelation buy and build house I said God I don't even have a house myself but it was like a revelation I talk to my wife she said if God has told you and I did it I I bought her land and built her a house she said brother I didn't even have land myself not long after that I went to buy land land was very expensive it is a village but it was very expensive in tens of Millions and I had only million in my hand Hallelujah but i' already given a seed and this was unconscious by the way but what I did I came I told this woman I have only 6 million can can I buy pay down payment anday the I think it was about 18 or something million he said no problem you are a pastor are you know I said yes he said I know God will do a miracle for you I said amen and she said you just pay that one but she said how many months do you give me I said told I told her six months and I went away and then there's a brother at that time I was still living in Ethiopia and you know God bless this brother our ministry and so he forwarded on my account of about I think three or four millions and when I when that money came I did not know it was from him but when I checked on my account I had about 18 million I said where did this money come from friends before I could ask the bank where it came from took all that money and paid my land and I came back I waited for the bank to contact me I was inop at that time I was in EOP at that time the bank did not contact me after a while I said let me contact the bank so I I said what happened I received more money than I expected they said let us check it was an ER in the system someone was sending 4 Millions repeating and so that's how it accumulated on your account he said but I've already used it so how will I pay it back they said we can consider it as a loan and I said but I did not apply for the they said no problem there is no interest and they said you can depose any money you depose we shall take it I said for how long they said for as long as there is money we shall take no problem I got a loan with no interest with no time period Hallelujah am where did it come from it came from the seed I had S without even knowing God gave me land of my own and now I have the land until now it is a lot of value now [Music] friends it's a principle if there is any Harvest you desire in your life find a seed that can produce that Harvest do you believe this or you don't I don't want to have problems with my deons after the sermon if you saw the seed of Honor do you know what you're going to get if the if you pray and God moves on my heart I will take several Services preaching on one seed and harest taking it through the whole Bible and showing you people who sold amen hor and they ripped access and we have many Believers even young ministers they want to be powerful they want to be powerful men of God but they have no access every door has been blocked no one can even let them preach and they don't know why and do you know what they doing they go to fasting and prayer Lord open do for me let Pastor allow me to preach invite me oh God open doors for me and God will not open the doors and they will go to the doors and they will try to push them open those are the ones you find in the churches fighting the pastor because they want to be the pastor now they want to be recognized as a preacher don't know they have to s a seed in order to reap access that seed is called H when you honor man that God has used praise God I noticed in all my life I've dealt with men of God I've worked with men of God are Way Beyond my age all over the world all over the world and sometimes I wondered how was that possible and one time there's a man of God I did not here in Uganda I'll not mention names of course and so God directly spoke to me there are some people who came to me speaking to me negative things about that man of and so I was almost about to start joining in that conversation and the Holy Spirit came to me at night and spoke to me so in a voice he said to me respect give honor you mention the name of the man I didn't even know why but from that day without even knowing this princi unconsciously because of obeying God I humbled myself I honored the man of God and from that time I've realized that I have no place in my heart ever compare myself with any other Pastor I honor all pastors and this will may surprise some of you those in the message and those out of theage I honor them I respect them do you know what that does it gives you access it puts you in places that you're not supposed to be in me honoring not outside honing from the heart you honor the man by the way you talk to them by the way you them what you do for them you can even decide to just take something and and say I would like to give you this Bible and by doing that you are honoring him and wait for access doors will be open does any one of you have open closed doors let me tell you you you you will pray you will even fast they will remain closed maybe you have been praying for open doors but when you go to office to apply for you are not respecting anyone you looking down on them because you think you are more educated than you know you like you are the one who does all those kind of fun you look down on everybody else that's why every door gets closed on you nobody wants you it's until you say I think I'm Beed you are not Beed you simply have not sold the right seat and there are people you find my God God help me to tell there are people you find wherever they go they are loved immediately and you become jealous you don't know what you're doing you don't know what you're doing let me help you those people are doing what you're not doing people are sowing the right kind of seeds they hon others they them you are the one who comes to the pastor and you are the one who will call him so all sorts of things when a pastor who came and said come to the man of God and You Begin speaking things the one who will call the p and you wonder why doors are closed for you and you begin saying but Pastor loves the other one more than there is a problem with you you are not showing the right seat look at the other people who are succeeding in the area where you are failing what are they doing that you are not doing they are so in the right seat how are they talking how are they behaving if you call a man of God he doesn't have to be me call them them Pastor find something don't just move as somebody who does not know the principles of I just give some of you access right now you say my mother-in-law hats me what seeds have you H your husband everything you want get I can talk a lot about that you know if you saw gifts you know giving arms I'll talk a little more about that you will get Prosperity you will get greatness if you s TI you the the B says you will get an open Heaven some of you the heaven is closed on you even your prayers are not being heard but ask yourself a question do you s ti do you pay your ti you see if you saw prayer and fasting what will you get what will you get Church you will get a Revival there is no other ingredient for a Revival if we want a Revival in our church only SE for that is prayer and fasting where you have men and women have a personal revelation pray and fast for the church to pray and fast for the ministry let it will bring Revival nothing else can do that money cannot do it the pastor cannot prayer and fasting for Revival prayer is a seed for breakthrough for healing those are seeds you have to find the right seed to S to attain the Harvest you but it is by Revelation showing something that you you have for something you do not have something you desire for God to do for you in your life what do you do you connect it to the right seat listen listen Church listen please listen I'm going to show you the scriptures a seed can provoke certain things to happen in your life did you understand that if you that say Amen it is only God who can tell you what to lay down what to sacrifice what to give in order to activate that law of sowing you can provoke certain things in your life with a seed listen we talked about a new phase this year a seed can actually end a season in your life and start another but I'll tell you something which will keep in you in one place greed what I have is only for me not anybody else whatever isn't in your life yet that is supposed to be there you just haven't found out how to get it but God has already given it to you by the word so this is a law that unlocks everything you need in your physical life you just know how to do it here comes a man of God and he comes to a woman who has only but little she's about to die her and her son they a little I want you to understand why it happened that and when a man of God comes it seems as if he did not have compassion he had compassion but he was try oh my God let the church receive this he was trying to activate something in this woman is life because she was about to die anyway so he was trying to activate the law of sewing and harvest so he told her give me to [Music] eat she said what this is all I have and he said I said give me to eat first whose decision was it the woman's decision she had to accept to decide to give to S into this man's life so that thatw can be AC and here the man of God emphasizes that's what I've said give me first to he knew it would activate more and the woman said but it's all right it's all right I will do it I will do it he that sth boun free shall reap B free are you hearing me she went and said I'm going to give it all she gave it all I said it's all right I'm going to die now and when she went back more did she expect it not a chance but how did it happen is the LA it's a love giving it's a love Harvest harest come the right way do we believe this or we don't now this is one of the gospels or the teachings that you don't only believe that's why talked about this in the message works is Faith expression you do something for it to be Isaac tells do you want more you want more you want more to to activate the blessing can Pastor are you telling us that now you are becom Pentecost have to give to receive that's the only Bible way if you don't give you can never receive even the blessings from God you will receive nothing you always be suffering you bless them but not doing something you are not and this is the secret I'm giving you today every one of you here has the potential to start another season in your life let me tell you we can even have millionaires in the church here let me tell you if you apply what I'm teaching you today you will prosper so much that we shall not have to suffer for anything many of you will drive no one here was cre that for them they will drive and this will not drive all of you can drive all of you can all of you can buy a house all of you who are going to school can get tution you only have to know the law the right principle and apply and then watch for the Harvest why why are message believer suffering God forgive me but God knows this I've never seen a sting group like the Believers of this Mage in Africa especially here in Uganda we are very Sting If I'm saying the truth help me to say Amen is it not the truth we are very stingy we don't give we don't give to the work of God the conventions they they said 50,000 40,000,000 giv let me tell you let me tell you Church whenever they say the conv is 50,000 the members of dvf don't look for 50 look for 100 and saw it in that Min right now they invited us for Easter meetings whether you're going to sleep there or not whether you going to live there or not so a big SE in yes give it much God reveals it to you they said how much is it 30 you do give 50 give 100 give the way you s is the way you shall reap we should have that Revelation so that the pcal don't go higher than us in anything if we have this we are much higher than anyone in Revelation of the word for Spiritual and physical because our God is a mighty God Amen but we are the ones who always cry they callor you said 30 that's too much can I 5K that you poor you don't have Revelation so much you shall let me show you Genesis 27 and it came to pass that when Isaac was old and his eyes were de so that he could not see he called es his oldest son and said unto him my son and he said unto him behold here I and he said behold now I am old and I know not the day of my death now I pray thee thy weapons thy quer and th bow and go out to the field and take me some vanish hallelujah amen and make me S meat such as I love and bring it to me give it to me bring it to me give it to me bring it to me to me that I may eat that my soul may bless before I die father you're making it difficult you just pray blessing no my blessing you will get after sewing God is the same way all these blessings are available already but you have to S the right seat so Isaac told es to bring a seed are you saying that if somebody else brings a seed will get the same blessing just follow the principle it doesn't matter who you are there is no one there is no one that was created for prosperity and another one was created for poverty I don't care about your background in the your family may be so poor your family may be so so downcast but you can change a face in your if no one has ever driven in your home you can be the fast if no one has ever built a house you can be the F just follow the principle Isaac spoke to es but is was just there around and Rebecca quickly came his son son I have overheard your father going to I know what you can do if you saw the right kind of your father will give you the please Rush this he brought it are you yes the voice is of Jacob anyway let me eat the moment accepted the the ration is there the moment he accepted this he did not go back into this voice simply said iess bless you what happened what happened the PRP of sewing was activated hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and Jacob received the blessing instead of es I don't care who was meant to be blessed someone can say can a man God yes with a SE dvf members are you still loving me am I still Pastor yes you can you can make a god do things for you which will shake everybody just with giving the right kind of just give it to God he simply gave and waited when the other came said the blessings have already been but wait how did it all start the blessing was meant for ES but this boy jaob always been so wise he knew how to snatch the blessing he began snatching it he so into es himself he said what do you want he said I want I want the spage he said that's all you want it is all right if I S Portage I want to reap your birth is that agree he said yes just give me avoid begging avoid begging avoid begging people can take your bir without you knowing the Bible says it is more blessed to give than to receive Jacob was very wise so he gave the P it seemed as if he was receiving nothing when you receive a blessing you don't see it coming you don't hear it coming you don't smell it coming you don't touch it coming but when it comes everybody sees come hallelujah amen and he received that blessing it was an exchange thought it was a joke but don't underestimate the principle of in other words whoever SS into your life is actually reaping blessings more than you so you should be jealous but you actually deciding to to s you go to a restaurant and you sit down and you actually find Believers shying away from paying when it is time for paying taking and then they they find is the bill pay this is the brother who is always poor let me tell you I'm teach DF I want to be rich allow me to teach you this if you want to tap blessings you don't Financial Blessings by prayer prayer brings Revival not money you get the idea prayer brings healing not not money if you if you saw the right kind of if you want you can pray if you don't want you can leave it will be done because Harvest is sure and after you have sold you see everybody has finished eating the people who have Revelation one time I was at a certain airport there's a white man a rich man he came on the table where I was and he started with me we introduced each other a pastor company count I said okay the moment I knew that I said please order for something please order for something he said I will not have anything I said please order I called the waiter come give him something so we at and he to pay afterward the good thing I had thecal we all broughty at the same time the waitress waitress was confused so I told her this is local that forign c so this is better and I was like pushing up so she took mine I said amen praise God I sold into that man so if you see any blessing on me I've been sewing a lot so when you go to eat with somebody don't have this poor mindset every bring everyone you how much okay it is 50,000 divide by poor I want five people in DVM who will say I will never be poor I will never be poor I want to be prosperous so I can serve God with my substance take all the bill pay it if you if you don't have it pay as much as you can you have sold in that people and harvested them amen hallelujah hallelujah some of you who have been doing it unconsciously you can go back and say I remember when I did this when I did this now you know it's a Bible principle do it much more even much more for the household of God of to the Believers don't say brother in need and you watch give them when we are contributing money for our land fun don't say well I want to be humble because if they say I'm the one giving the big one say I am proud those are poor mentality it's a very poor mentality give as much as you why because you are sewing into the ministry and if you the right kind [Applause] of your Harvest reaping allow me to go for 30 more minutes Psalms 1235 they that have sold in tears shall reap in joy that goth forth and weepeth bearing precious the condition is not good for you life is very hard but there is something that you you have a SE amen shall doubtless come again with rejoicing as long as you have a seed and you give that seed you will come back Rejoice bringing your sh with you praise the name of the Lord ezel 4430 and the first of all the first fruits of all [Music] things there's a brother who told me very successful man he told me you know what there is something Believers don't do they don't pay their first FRS you get a job and your you chew it you buy you get a very huge piece of land it's all yours you sell land all the money is needed it's but what does the scripture say the first of all the first fruits of all things every obl of every sort of your blessings shall be the pr it shall be the priest it will be for the priest now Pastor now pastor wants money for [Music] us well have not I've given to this church more than any of you and there's no way that I want money from you but a priest the priest is supposed to reap from the Harvest of the people as a matter of fact brother says TI is not for building the church it's not even for renting the church not for helping the widows of the PO TI is for the minister it is the pastor's income and he said now even first fruits bring it to the priest there is a reason why wait for it he shall give unto the priest the first of your death that he may call that he may cause that he the priest he may cause the blessing to rest in th house and you wonder why you have no bless when you harvest your first crops you chew it when you get you chew everything you chew you chew you chew you don't even even when you are giving tith you don't give full tithe and you expect a blessing you will never be blessed if you don't give full tith don't even bother to give TI at all give all of it that's what the principle says me I have been a tith payer ever since it was revealed to me out of every resources I reive I pay my ties I've been paying my ties ever since I received this Revelation it is not a lot to me the Revelation giving is not never alone Revelation some of you be like H I give my money so I can prosper the p po mentality if you give you are blessed more than the one you are giving the blessing does not go reverse the blessing begins here where the giver is and the more you give the more you receive honor the Lord with thy substance Proverbs 3:9 and with the first fruits of all thine increase so shall thy B Be fill Believers are not saying amen at all let me tell you if I were you I would be shouting aen and dancing on the I am receiving Revelation to come out of poverty honor the Lord don't care how many fear to preach this I am going to preach it even if they HTE me if you want you can go even I am going to say what the word says if I remain with 50 people who are doing it they will prosper we will all Prosper the church will prosper the work of God will prosper and even everybody in the country will know there is something called theti message one message Pastor recently talked to me and said every Ministry has its own inclination and he said to me that now Robert Kay for him his inclination and the grace God has placed upon is prosperity but while I was listening I remembered the video I had watched I remember the video I had watched of Robert Kay when he was in America some years ago and brother when brother kmas was here he mentioned how many remember him mentioning about a man called um what what's the name of the pastor he mentioned how many Benson idosa Benson Osa Benson Osa is like the father of Pentecostal Nigeria very blessed man very wealthy man very spiritual Ed well of course they never had the revelation of the message but they had the understanding of this principle and so now B was poor was a poor from Africa from Uganda he had visited America and and when he he was there and and and you know he comes in a meeting he preaches and this pastor gives him um um I don't remember the amount but I think some amount on the check I think it was either 1,000 or and so I think it was $1,000 I don't remember and and so this BOS came and he started talking how God blessed them in Niger and if you want to search you can search on that man is very successful man I believe those are the men that even raised up people like brother cos because brother cosas himself told us and that's why I'm sharing this testimony because he was with Bon and uh he Benson started speaking people of course this is where Pentecostalism has got it wrong he told the people because they were doing some fundraising for the building there and he said we are not poor Nigeria and you Pastor you're struggling with this church I I'll give you people the principle that will make them rich and will prosper the church so he say to everybody he said everyone here the doors should be locked I said this is where Pentecostalism goes I don't believe that and that everybody here should bring um $5,000 and is the check that Pastor Robert had and Pastor Robert started judging the man said this man is very proud how can he even ask us to no no no no no I'm not giving anything and he came directly to him after a while he said you are going to give $5,000 and quickly a white woman came and brought the money to brother Robert for him to give it because the woman the white people thought that maybe the black man so quickly he was also a black man he rebuked this white woman he said why do you always think you to bail us he has to do it himself take back your money and the woman took back in fear and still Robert said this guy is really proud how could he rebuke a woman like this now we are the only two black people here if they arrest us think we are committing assult long story short eventually he gives the check and the moment he gave it the bishop started jumping up and down shouting say amen hallelujah my friend you are you congratulations God has delivered you from poverty welcome from from poverty well of course Robert was still saying but now and he will give me back my and when they went around after the service the man this is his testimony Robert said they went out the man showed him he opened here a lot of money here a lot of money here Nigerian I'm not poor my friend God has blessed me he said oh no you give me back my money he was think thinking he would give me so he said I see you after the service and so after the service he went to check in the hotel told the man stole from me all my money is but he said even before he left long story short that was the beginning of his prosperity now you can debate with Robert Kay tell me he's a false preacher tell he doesn't know the reage and tell him he's not going in the because he has not know of our Propet and the message of you could be right in all those things but you cannot win the argument in material wealth hased these are men who started Uganda churches and they were begging white people but he's one of those first people and the reason why I gave this ton publicly because Robert claims that his spiritual father is is a te Lor we know thator came out of the ministry by the and and and and and their Church they were so poor but when he received that revelation of fath people and other so friends this principle does not apply only to message believer it applies to anyone who will care to apply it upon their h and so where was I honor the Lord with thy substance and the first fruits of all your increase so shall thy burs be filled with and th preses shall burn shall shall burst out with new wine hallelujah hallelujah honor the Lord all right I have 15 more minutes Listen First Kings 34 and the King went to gibon to sacrifice there I want you to see something here what did God give Solomon wisdom so if you want wisdom what do you do give me wisdom Lord in the name of Jesus Christ me Lord understanding how many have S prayed such prayer let me disappoint you it will never be answered the more you pray for wisdom the more you become listen friends there is a principle before God gave the man wisdom what did he do follow me and the King went to gibon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place what listen a thousand bur [Music] offerings did Solomon offer upon that you are not even giving 50 shs you are saying I don't have anything to give but God give me wisdom because even the Bible says God loves those who have a cont is the offering my friend it does not work that way your offering comes with you in your hands I I can say say that authoritatively because in this Bible we believe there is no one person who has ever worshiped god without an offering find him and I will apologize no worship without an offering and if you come to church without an offering repenting today come with an offering prare it on Saturday don't find the money which is teared I will give that one you pick the smallest that is poor mentality God want to prosper you but you should have a revelation of Solomon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 it must have been a work of I don't know how long offering after offering offering after offering in the Lord appear to Solomon in a Dream by night after he gave his offering God came to him in the somebody say hallelujah and God asked ask what I shall give thee give and he shall receive ask what I shall give thee and Solomon said thou has showed thy servant David my father great Mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and righteousness and in all brightness of heart with thee and thou has kept for him this great kindness and thou has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is as as it is this day and now oh Lord my God was this a dream yes so God comes in dreams and you can have a conversation with god in a dream and now oh Lord my God and some of you don't dream well because you don't succeed you only talk about spiritual husband spiritual whatever nightm so the right seeds my friend my God th made thy servant King instead of of David my father and I am little child I know not how to go out or come in and th servant is in the midst of th people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered no counted of a multitude give there thy servant and understanding heart to judge thy people that I may Des between good and bad for who is able to judge this people are great are you are you hearing me we about to reach and the speech please the Lord that's it was not a prayer it was a speech you just give your seed because it is not your prayer that moves God it is your speech that is accompanying your seed well I will preach it even if you don't like me it is the word of and God said unto him because thou has asked this thing and has not asked for anything for th long for thyself long life neither has asked riches for nor has as the life of thine enemies but but you have asked for yourself understanding to design judgment behold I have done according to Thy word Lord I have given the a wise and un understanding heart Hallelujah let me pause there a moment when God gave Solomon a wise what happened oh my god when God gives somebody Grace you too can tap from that gra how does that happen if you do the same thing that he did what did Solomon do he gave seed and God gave him and understanding what happened later people like the woman of Ethiopia the queen of candes Amen she had of Solomon's wisdom and she gathered a lot of wealth she gathered gold she got a lot of wealth and she went to Solomon she wanted to do what to tap from the wisdom of what did she do she also gave and what happened she received what she received access she received access because she HED solom by giving the right kind of wealth my God this is the principle of the Bible Hallelujah so that there was n like before and God said I'll give you wisdom understanding and I have also given thee that which thou has not asked I have also given you what you have not asked my God I'm having a good time up here I've also given you what you have not asked both riches and hor so that there shall be not be any among the Kings like unto thee all thy days and if thou will work in my ways to keep my statutes and my Commandments as th Father David did then I will lengthen your days that's why all the rich brothers and sisters they themselves the more God makes you bigger the more you humble yourself because you know it has nothing to do with your hard work it is God is Grace and blessings and the more you humble yourself the more God adds on you think Solomon just came across and asked for wisdom and understand so we have people who pray for the same there is a principle what have you sold for what have you sold for it if you give arms to the poor God has promised in Proverbs 1917 he will repay you and when God repays you God repays you handsomely 10 verse1 there was a certain man in ceria called Cornelius of B called it B A Dev man and one that feared God with all his [Music] house which gave much arms to the people and prayed to God always he gave two seeds he gave arms and he was always praying he saw in a vision evidently about the nth hour of the day an angel of God coming into him and saying Himel and when he looked at him he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said unto him thy prayers and arms are you here are you here Church he that your prayers and your what and your what and your what arms I come up for a memorial you're giving your go straight to God and now when God heard that he said send to and call for one Simon whose son name is Peter the man kept sewing prayer and arms prayer and arms God pays back all those who gives arms the man prayed and gave God paid back with the Revival Hallelujah God paid backom because there was prayer added to it and a Revival came broke out in his house and he was prosperous he and his all his house you can give seed for your family there was once a man who did it his name is job he did not know how his children were living when calamity his house he said he gave a bur offering for each of his children he said per Adventure they have sinned before that's another learning for another day you can even give SE for such sin offering this this subject is Broad no wonder this P have made it a subject of every day because it is Broad you can learn it and learn it and but just learn one principle when you give you receive when you give you planted your seed and it shall be given to you and I'll finish with these scriptures Luke 638 give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down Shen together running over give into your B give into your B God is going to bring people into your life Hallelujah that will s into your life I have been there I've been there friends I'm telling you I have been there where I give somebody comes to me telling me their problem and I give them all I have many people think I have a lot because I am rich in my heart and I speak like a rich man and I say am a rich man and so I gave all I had and as soon as I did very day I received 1,000 fold it is a princip of the word men shall give unto you for with the same measure that me with it shall be measured to you praise the name of the Lord I have showed you all things acts 2035 how that so laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive and when you go back again in the scripture we find that Abraham sold Toc all the ti all that he had and later on when he received the Three Angels as they walked in Abraham knew the principle tell your neighbor Abraham knew the and when he saw them coming the Bible says he quickly told sah he told the people please come let us eat let us eat and sah did not say I don't have budget for these people for them I don't s a revelation we are going to be blessed we are going to be blessed we are going to be blessed friends listen if you receive visas in your home planned or not planned for begin dancing we are going to be blessed we are going to be blessed make sure people don't leave your home empty in their stomach give them feed them give them drinks Hallelujah Hallelujah you do not know how much blessings you are collecting there when you do that you are sewing you may be like that that Widow it may be your last portion give it anyhow give it joyful don't hide under don't hide food under the table don't hide it under the bed you know I remember you know the village when I Vis Sometimes some homes when a visor comes one child come say someone is coming in one second everything is under they begin moving [Music] around you are smelling food but you're not seeing food and all of the sudden when you see the heart there is food but not see poor people are like that poor people like that don't be poor brother sister Hallelujah it may be your last meal share it give it away if it means to be empty tell God my children have nothing to eat your servants have come in my home I'm going to give them all I have you have sold into their wait for the har it must come it is a princi of Abraham them hallelujah amen and a moment abrah them he started amen the anointing came now according to the time of life next year your wife shall have a son what come from he [Applause] sold hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen my time is up by 3 minutes but I know this has been longer usually this is one hour and a half but I don't usually do this but how many say this is worth it it has been worth it we have learned this principle but I've not exhausted everything we all know Malachi 3 he says bring all your ties into the storehouse never eat TI is a seed first fruit is a seed never chew it the moment you Che it you coming cures into your home and if you been doing it repent no one should be poor Among Us no whether you are educated or if if Believers did this principle they don't even need to go to Saud Arabia you don't need to do that you don't need Abraham was in in the desert he got a blessing there whever you are the blessing shall find you just saw the seed bring your ti into the may have meat in my house prove me now here with say the lot of if I will not open you the windows of I told you TI is a seed the Harvest is open Heaven I will open you the windows of Heaven When Heaven open ask your neighbor what happens when Heaven open hallelujah amen hallelujah yes I'll open the windows of Heaven I power you out a blessing that there shall be not room to receive it now but if you don't have room for blessings in your house it means you don't PTI but if you pay your ties you will have enough room and room will run out for blessings and it doesn't stop there I will also rebuke the div for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast have fruit before the time you may be a farmer plant your to potatoes even if you plant them in cans at home you will get [Music] plenty if it doesn't work call me I will come and organize the issue find out what is happened but I can assure you it works it works and all the nations shall call you blessed for you shall be at the light some land in he says now ver say the Lord of consider your ways you have sown much but bring in little you eat but you don't have enough you drink but he have not filled clo but there is none warm and wages wages to put it into a with I don't know e this economy you get the money it just passes through you things are Happ bus is hard I don't know it is hard is Harding that amen you have to confess today that shall be no longer my song I shall sing a new song th lot of your ways which ways do you s the right kind of seed to if you it depends on what you want if you want a big blessing saw a big SE Pastor now you're talking like a real pentec yes it's a Bible principle and I'll finish with a testimony of a man called joh I have the quot here but because of time I not read it but if you want it it is in many messages but in faith without works is dead brother bam actually preaches this same teaching through the testimony exactly the same teaching he said John Char was a man that was poor from a poor background and they were selling apples and ni they didn't have much and then this man was married he was looking for a wife and then God gave him a wife and then God did not give them children so were baren so he's married bar and poor that's the situation of many believer but there is something he did that turned around his life forever that every believer loves to talk about don't want to do what he did this man was beating on the roads making trying to make money with his wife and they made some money and so they built a house for themselves after many years of suffer and after buying that house they moved in they were lovely and happy and while the man slept God came to him in a dream and they told him John Char pick some of your clothes and some of specifically told him the belonging to Pi this house there is a man of God my man who is I don't remember the name of the man Dr Dr sat is coming into this city he going to to hold a Revival so give brother Saturn that house praise the name of the Lord and he said give it to him just like that so the man came out of the dream and he came to his wife he said darling wife God visited me in the night and told me I should give we should pack our clothes we should leave everything the way but take only our cloes who agree sisters think about it if your husband told you like that would you agree what what about the children God cannot give you a trial that is more heavy than you that's the reason why he had not given them children yet CU he had to test them and he didn't want children to suffer so he had to test them in order for them to get a bigger blessing so when they get children children will be more comfortable God wants your children to be comfortable if you have children and you don't have the blessings take care of them check area of sewing and the sister said my darling husband God spoke to you it is all right we will do just what he said so they packed up their bags and left the house and told Dr Saturn Saturn this is now your house no you must take it it is your house he said all right he took it the moment he received it it was a seed planted to give his an opportunity you must force your receiver to receive that's why this white brothers in America the Africans beg them and they know some of them are deceiving them but they still give they an opportunity to get more wealth and the Africans think should beg more that's a poor mindset we should not beg we should do what they do we should give we should give I am aie of that all and try and see what and John Char and his wife left the house they went back to the stones after a few years after little while God brought a millionaire woman talk to John Char said you look like a good man I've been sing I can give you a place to leave if you don't have a place to leave in the garage my garage as long as you can take care of my flowers he said it's all right so he went in the garage of this woman and out of there he was taking care of the flowers humility character before a big blessing if you are proud you will never be blessed and then finally the same God who came to joh charity some years ago came to this woman she was sleeping and God said to her take a check of $10,000 and give it to and he came she came to him you been a Christian a bible to read when I slept God spoke to me and told me to give you this check I don't what can I do he said no it is an instruction from I must give it to you will find out what to use with and when John sh took the CH he was with it for a while he didn't and then while they were moving on the road they saw an old house they bought it $6,000 $3,000 and and they renovated it they sold it $6,000 they continued like that bought another one another one and became [Music] millionaires that's a testimony from our Prophet testing to the fact that the principle of sewing is is biblical and of God and that it is possible for someone to become a millionaire because they a good s and they sewing the right kind of if we receive that revelation we shall not struggle with give to the L offering give to the radio broadcast we are very busy here suffering we don't even have money to go on the radio broadcast we only 250,000 a month only know there people here who can afford it yes you may afford it when it is all you have this month this week I'm paying it and you do it I was at spe and brother is a pastor from isaka he shared with me a testimony we were in that room and we Shar Fellowship myself and brother Gideon and he told me has been a model in the country on this thing of giving this is what he said I'm repeating his words said years ago when was still poor and the church was still very L down there the pastor encouraged the people to give and then Pastor Gideon also said yeah we started radio broadcast when people were very poor barely had nothing but they had rast and brother R continued there is a sister who had just served us and he said this sister had nothing she was a housemade and she came in the church and brought her seed of 100,000s and brother turned to brother gide brother Prince you were there right and he said he said to brother Gideon wasn't that said yes she was so it must have been all but never refused it he accepted and brother said po why are you taking the money no let them it sounds inhuman right don't that's the way of blessings the woman long story short she was living somewhere people went abroad and then later on they told her find land she found land they built fire house and they paid school fees for all her children and now she lives in her own home from a housemid a house owner can a housem build a house only God can do that but she followed the principle of sowing SE of sowing seed I cannot preach it better than that rest is now up to you the rest is up to you we we are not going to say okay now now that preached it the one that bring one million come here the one of 500 come we will don't do that it is a revelation you might as well do it if God tells you to do it you know the needs of the church we're looking for land to do radio broadcast you've heard I'm going to Switzerland don't say Pastor let him go let him goast how much is your air ticket and I'll tell you the amount I'll pay half I'm giving you opportunities of giving does it mean I don't have it doesn't mean that but many times we announce oh there is dis need we leave it why we do that we are giving an opportunity for those who have inspiration to SCE so they can reap let us stand on our feet hallelujah hallelujah I said days of the voice Fellowship of The Voice fellowship if we put this to work there shall be no Among Us I did not say we will all become millionaires but I said there shall
