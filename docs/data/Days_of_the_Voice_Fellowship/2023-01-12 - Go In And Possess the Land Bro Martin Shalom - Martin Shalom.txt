TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the Lord Our God spoke I'm reading Deuteronomy chapter 1 verses 6 to Aid the Lord Our God spake unto uh spoken to us in horrib saying you have dwelled long enough in this mountain and take your journey and go to the Mount of Amorite and unto all these places near there unto in the plane in the hills and in the veil and in the South and by the side and by the seaside the land of Canaanites and unto Lebanon and to the Great River the river is ready behold I have said the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them blessed Jesus we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read yes like a prophet tell us that every man can read uh they can turn the pages of this Bible is indeed it is true Lord maybe because he went to school and we know how to read it but I say that is only you who give it the Revelation give us Revelation tonight bless us in one way the name of Jesus Christ amen me now praise be to God yeah this evening uh yes I was told that I want us to share together yeah we have uh it's our common scripture not common as in but it has been read multiple times in different Gatherings and uh I will take that very uh the last scripture we read where it says that behold I've said the land before you go in and possess The Landings my text is go in and possess the land praise be to God hope it is uh I think it's our greatest desire amen God wants us to go in and we possess our land and where we have read here we are seeing God speaking to Moses the Lord uh here they say the Lord Our God's back unto us in a horror they are remembering what God had spoken to them that's why if we keep reading the scripture we will know our promises because like that song say that every promise in the book is mine government foreign that all the rebellious will die and all of the innocent will inherit the land oh there we are they are straight around Mount Holly is but I believe some of them were reading the word they had a promise which God gave them from Moses praise be to God and they say the Lord our Gods back unto us in horrible saying you have dwelt long enough in this mountain ye and take your journey and go to the Mount of amorites they were comfortable where they are not supposed to be much foreign but God reminded them they remember the scripture they remember the promise because the prophet tells us that a Jew will only be blessed when it's in the right place in the promised lands be to God but when we are out of our Promised Land there's no way God can bless us and All Through the Ages we are seeing that unless they are in their right place amen man and told them tell me and take your journey and go to the Mount of amorites all the places near there in the plane in the hills and in the valley and in South and by the seaside near before I'm seeing something here the land which we were supposed to possesses in the plane and in the hills and in the South you have to possess all these places if you know you are right if you know you are inheritance praise the Lord maybe someone comes and tells you that your father left your land somewhere and then you are given a date then when you reach there say that oh do you know what okay I have like this other place the other place uh there's none of my business [Music] that shows that you are not seriously because when the encroach has come they will start with that pushing area and they will end up overtaking you know amen and say I've set the land before you again go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father's Abraham and Isaac are from Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them that is the promise God gave to Abraham so this weather on the on their channel the promised land and God told them you have stayed here long enough they have seen Miracles amen all those things were good but that was not the main thing God had inheritance for them and God was expecting them to move forward and this is sample of our daily life we are testing about God's healing about God setting us free we have seen God doing many things amen that's where our promises lie all these things they are good believe it because if God is quiet we will not be encouraged but when it comes and drops these blessings to us it's like he's encouraging us to move forward so God was not happy with them and he came and told them you have stayed here long enough foreign of all the art passes over before you into them out of the tribe of Israel out of every tribe a man and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priest that bears the act of the Lord the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and there shall stand upon and him yes um [Music] amen and he came to pass when the people removed when the people removed from their turn to pass over Jordan and the priest bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as they bear as and and as they that bear the ark will come unto Jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the aqua dipped into the brims of cream of water for Jordan overfloweth all his Banks and all the time of harvest [Music] remember I told you that this journey was supposed to be for 11 days but because these people they doubted God they marveled against Moses and against God and God at one time want to destroy them stood in between them and God that if you will destroy these people what will the Heathen Nation say [Music] that their God was not even able to deliver them to God but remember when God sends his words this word will not return to him that word must accomplish it is God spoke to Moses and told him I will not destroy them God had another way of doing it turned into 40 years and all Bible readers know that uh it's only two whom it is the promised land those who are among the elders who came out of Egypt praise people at that time the Lord spoke unto Joshua make bishop knives and circumcise again the children of uh the children of Israel the second time and Joshua meant to him and circumcision of Israel at the hill of the foreskin and this is the cause and and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise and all the people that came out of Egypt that were a man even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt more video welcome um [Music] amen Amina remember this too they had a land to possess your Korea go in and possess the land but there is a condition before the possession of the land here God instructed Joshua and told him to circumcise these people the second time remember this was the generation which were born in the wilderness because where we have read we find out that majority died of the elders who are those who came out of Egypt died in the wilderness the Young Generation were born in the wilderness [Music] they were not circumcised remember that the circumcision before the promised land again we must be circumcised [Applause] praise but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt then they are not circumcised [Music] for the chain of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were a man of war which came out of Egypt which were consumed because they obeyed another voice of the Lord and to whom the Lord swear that they would not show them the land which the Lord swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land that flood with milk and honey baby [Music] um and their children whom it raised up in the uh in their state then Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way eight and it came to pass when they are done circumcising all the people that the that they are bored in their places in the camp till they were a whole and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from of you wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day yes [Music] [Music] amen uh let's read 10 after 12. and the Church of Israel uh in the Church of Israel camp in gilgal and kept the Passover on the 15th day of the month at even in the plane of oh sorry of the month at even in the plane of Jericho and they did each of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the Passover and leaving cake and pastures corn in the same in self same day and Manna seized on the moral after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel manner anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Ganon that year universities [Music] [Music] praise be to God and the message Israel and the church the prophet said that come and let let cross the Jordan let's go over and possess the landing the trouble of it is with people today we are trying to depend on uh on experience they had about 20 years ago you know what happened to that manner it's not bad to mention that the past experience but we don't need to be comfortable with those experiences because the Bible tells us in Hebrews Jesus Christ is the same yesterday Guru [Music] foreign it says becomes incarnate in a man [Music] and the Holy Spirit goes up and comes down incarnate man no more oh what a Time praise you to God he said that God put fresh anointing on every Minister here and every lady here is and we must be circumcised before we enter into the promises this year is ending just feel like maybe uh two weeks from now or a few days and we know that God is coming for church without spot or wrinkles and we know that when Jesus comes he will not step here on Earth we must be changed that will meet him on the air praise be to God so friends I don't know how you are I don't know where you are standing tonight but here is the message that God is commanding us to move forward coming to church God still has more we must grow in the splash of the perfect man we must enter the Holy Ghost praise be to God we must live a Victorious life because things are normal we know that gentle days are numbers and soon the Lord is [Applause] the promise given to us we say that in later days I will promise foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] been uh God uh when Joshua had done according to the word of the Lord listen to 13. he said that it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold this to the man over against him we destroyed down in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him and now for us or for our anniversaries [Music] but we are seeing God reminding them you've stayed here too long you are comfortable with only shouting dancing in the spirit speaking in tongue but I want you to enter into the stretch of the perfect man where his presence is real Christian can reach a point Christianity many times there is an astray we are not seriously because we just hear the god of our fathers my husband [Applause] that is foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign God calling us again we need fresh anointing from God remember the Bible says anointing breaks the Yoke you can have Bible again he's saying that Elijah wears second-handed rope when he came to the river but he needed a brand new and that was first-handed call from God and first-handed power from God perform the Miracles amen other people always are walking in something that happened years ago yes sir Mina you see the more you read the message you start challenge yourself personally the government to I have been reading the message for some good time [Music] but there's a time when you reach you want to see these things happening in your life that is the importance of reading the word because the message brings this God that is how he reveals God because ah okay he brings him more and more closer praise be to God and you see God operating in the prophet um manifesting himself amen so that's why we need to read the word praise the lord we have got to learn to possess please and God sent us go in and possess if you just belong to a denomination God don't have any grandchild we are sons and daughters but no grandson and no daughters don't have that cartoon you just have sons and daughters we must encounter God as an individual of us has a promise and told him give me my mountains foreign [Applause] if what will set your heart on fire for God praise the Lord that is what God is looking for people who are determined people are ready to walk with him may God give me the grace may God give me the determination in my heart look the past mistakes of God I remember within this video [Applause] many times among others he had his Target [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] may God give us the grace may God put that desire in our hearts but the Bible says blessed is the man who angers and prosperous but we shall be finished may God give us that task for money I may not ask for food but if God gives me hunger and pass for righteousness amen if we have God we have everything we need is our father is our mother it's our sister it's our brother it's our husband is our groom it's our life it is the Holy Ghost God Jesus told Nicodemus but I wonder that you don't know this thing the only thing we need in our lives what's going to keep us it is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the one who searched in the Deep things of God to walk in the Holy Ghost praise be to God he says if you are kissing and flooding with the world is [Applause] foreign friends my precious Brothers we need to decide we need to stand by our confession amen in this message as I was with Moses so will I be with thee um he says that Reuben meant uh Shepherd agament and God means cattle raise blessed each one of us where he belongs today of what we need a Joshua for today the trouble today when we and when we are come in our Promised Land amen and one want to raise something like the others every man want to be the same let God give one man a gift of healing every man who wants a gift of healing foreign [Applause] but remembers the Holy Spirit blessing us in our rightful place that the Lord is gracious healing your sin is Miracles you have seen his power you have blessed the power of the world what are you waiting for that is amen we must get personal experience God has ever spoken to you yes yes it is but brother sister God can't even speak to you audibly foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] and then we'll shine it down praise you to God maybe that's the way but we as a Christian as long as God has spoken to us whether it is Peter whether it is sweet we just say yes Lord praise be to God believe us we must be flexible we don't need to be stiffness sometimes God speak to us when we are doing silly things pretend as if we have not had foreign [Music] remember that song that he has sounded for the trumpet and it's not sounding for a retreat today but we are moving forward so onward Christian Soldier um [Applause] even at a certain point Jesus wanted to quit amen he wears the garden of God's sermons and he was fighting within him song then he was looking at the heaviness of the Cross because God was going to reject him and he thought of quitting the cross and she was going to lose the whole human race but your will be done so sometimes this cross is heavy but Brothers quit as they don't win he told me whatever things fail Ure denied Saturn do you know the canes I will get you but if I leave my leg here even when I come back I will not be treated like the one who just who left but not to a True Believer Believers when we cross the bridge we are told to break the bridge or you die praise be to God Amen the same applied to the Church of the army of Christ remember we are fighting the battle which Jesus won long time instead of quitting we are in the army of the Lord we have to fight and win this battle today amen so we better decide ask God to give us the grace sir rather we are fighting battles every day yesterday I was thinking about I was looking at what I've gone through this year every year comes with his own challenge but one thing we are sure that when the enemy comes like the flowers praise be to God sometimes people say um where the Prophet says where he was saying that uh okay it was talking about Martin Luther King and say that he will lead the Negroes into that trap praise be to God and uh I was just looking at it in this way if you look at the tension between the blacks and the whites like in U.S mostly especially in U.S foreign in the world in and he said but take a heart if I have overcome our only refugees in Christ ages that's the only place where we are secured remember the grace of God is living the Gentiles and we know as God is winding up with the gentle dispensations may God fill each one of us with the Holy Spirit praise be to God that's the way my young brothers from I believed when I was in senior Too Fast Times and from that time I lived all my life at school for Christ my closest friend was the message book I never attended any sport game
