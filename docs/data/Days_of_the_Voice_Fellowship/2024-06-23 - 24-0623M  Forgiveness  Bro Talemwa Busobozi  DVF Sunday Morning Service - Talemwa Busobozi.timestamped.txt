[1:11:42] heart they believed this
[1:11:45] message now not only that but before
[1:11:48] they traveled back from the
[1:11:51] bar that man was
[1:11:53] baptized in the name of
[1:11:56] our so you see God is able to make a
[1:11:59] trial a
[1:12:02] blessing if it will take him to take a
[1:12:04] life of the
[1:12:07] innocent he will do it to redeem a
[1:12:11] soul well of course the innocent we know
[1:12:13] that they go to
[1:12:15] heaven and so it's Double L to the
[1:12:18] enemy praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:12:22] and this morning I also wanted to
[1:12:23] announce
[1:12:26] that um
[1:12:28] we is the sixth
[1:12:30] month and so we are
[1:12:34] now um usually in this around the end of

[1:12:53] coming we just have six month
[1:12:56] away how many are
[1:12:59] expected amen you don't look like you're
[1:13:02] expected how many I really expect
[1:13:05] expectation well I believe that the Lord
[1:13:07] has great things prepared for
[1:13:11] us H the the news I have to announce to
[1:13:14] you this
[1:13:15] morning is that God had your prayers I
[1:13:18] think about two three weeks ago I told
[1:13:20] you to pray for our guest
[1:13:26] God had laid on my heart to
[1:13:29] invite and um so this morning I would
[1:13:32] like to say they have all
[1:13:37] confirmed
[1:13:39] now one of the brothers I
[1:13:42] invited is an elder in this
[1:13:45] message he has a really Dynamic
[1:13:48] Ministry which I believe is going to be
[1:13:50] a very of a very immense blessing
[1:13:56] to all the young people that will
[1:13:58] come but something
[1:14:00] happened brother Joseph chosi from from
[1:14:03] the
[1:14:06] UK
[1:14:08] um he he of course I visited his work
[1:14:12] his churches in
[1:14:15] Zimbabwe this brother is an
[1:14:18] apostle God has helped him to start many
[1:14:22] churches one of the elders in Zimbabwe
[1:14:26] and so I got an opportunity to visit one
[1:14:29] of the okay his first church in
[1:14:34] m and also
[1:14:36] in um and um of course these churches
[1:14:39] now have other
[1:14:42] pastors but still oversees the
[1:14:45] work for him he now moved to the
[1:14:48] UK and uh he has another church there
[1:14:51] which
[1:14:53] is uh when I I I've been praying about
[1:14:56] it for a
[1:14:57] while so when I contacted him when I
[1:15:01] felt the time was right I contacted him
[1:15:04] and by
[1:15:06] email and told him about the
[1:15:09] meetings and um he said right now I'm I
[1:15:14] think he was at the airport or something
[1:15:15] like that he was traveling to
[1:15:18] Zimbabwe he said I'll let you know I'll
[1:15:22] give you feedback contact me next week
[1:15:27] so that was I think this
[1:15:29] week so I I contacted him this
[1:15:34] week and I received a
[1:15:37] response he said I've
[1:15:40] confirmed come to the
[1:15:42] meeting but here is what I wanted you to
[1:15:46] see as soon as I responded to that
[1:15:51] message uh Pastor Leo sent me
[1:15:58] message with a
[1:16:02] of completely
[1:16:05] dismantled and with a message on
[1:16:08] it saying Pastor Joseph CH has been
[1:16:10] involved in a a terrible car head on car
[1:16:15] accident with a driver who did not have
[1:16:19] lights and uh so he said that you know
[1:16:22] so the message but he said he's in the
[1:16:24] hospital
[1:16:26] I believe I've just I've just answered
[1:16:28] his email which has just sent
[1:16:32] me you know I I
[1:16:34] realized he answered that email when he
[1:16:37] was at the hospital
[1:16:42] bed after
[1:16:46] that and that's when I get the
[1:16:49] response so I had to call one of his
[1:16:52] sons ask him is this
[1:16:55] true he said yes it is true and later on
[1:17:00] um Pastor
[1:17:03] Joseph sent me this message which I
[1:17:05] thought I should share with
[1:17:08] you because I found it to be a very
[1:17:11] Supernatural
[1:17:14] evil he said I am well I do not know how
[1:17:18] I escaped
[1:17:19] that that remains a
[1:17:22] paradox that is the closest I have been
[1:17:25] to
[1:17:27] death it it had to be only
[1:17:30] God I think I must have died for about
[1:17:33] five or so
[1:17:36] minutes I do not recall even how I was
[1:17:39] pulled
[1:17:41] out I only gained Consciousness after
[1:17:44] they stood me up after the
[1:17:49] rescue no bone was
[1:17:52] broken amen
[1:17:55] the Bible says he will protect them that
[1:17:57] even no B will be
[1:17:59] broken I'm still in hospital but I am
[1:18:02] I'm I'm
[1:18:03] St I have some pain and discomfort from
[1:18:07] a cut on the top of my
[1:18:10] head which should have killed me that
[1:18:15] cut it was a head on collision with a
[1:18:17] car without lights
[1:18:25] and my car rolled three
[1:18:27] times and landed on the
[1:18:30] roof I thank God for sparing my
[1:18:36] life you may think this is a
[1:18:40] coincidence I just invite him and then
[1:18:44] this happens I said it's not a
[1:18:47] coincidence the devil was
[1:18:51] angry I believe he did not want him to
[1:18:53] come
[1:18:55] now the devil is going to see what will
[1:18:59] happen because this man who just
[1:19:02] survived
[1:19:03] death has confirmed coming to speak to
[1:19:08] our and I believe
[1:19:10] that the devil will not hinder the will
[1:19:13] of
[1:19:15] God so we have a brother Joseph
[1:19:20] coming also our brother Wayne Lawson
[1:19:23] Wayne from from the
[1:19:26] USA he a wonderful uh uh
[1:19:29] speaker he's been speaking at several
[1:19:32] youth
[1:19:33] camps in in in Europe in Canada in
[1:19:39] America is a pastor in the US I met him
[1:19:42] when I was in
[1:19:44] swizerland I believe his ministry will
[1:19:47] be a
[1:19:49] blessing and also a brother called
[1:19:52] Andrew Glover
[1:19:55] so it's going to be a full
[1:19:57] pack I believe God is going to
[1:20:00] move in those youth meetings so we will
[1:20:04] send out the we'll begin doing the
[1:20:05] invitations and everything after we have
[1:20:07] had our first
[1:20:09] meeting we still have a few things to
[1:20:12] confirm with some service
[1:20:16] providers because I we are intending to
[1:20:19] have there's a school uh called Britain
[1:20:22] it's close to pan

[1:28:14] word in the precious name of
[1:28:17] Jesus amen
[1:28:20] [Applause]
[1:28:22] amen amen we're going to turn to the
[1:28:24] Book of Mark
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:46] 11 from vers 23 to vers 26
[1:29:04] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:29:06] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[1:29:09] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[1:29:13] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:29:16] shall be believe that those things which
[1:29:18] he has said shall come to pass he shall
[1:29:21] have whatsoever he saith
[1:29:37] therefore I say unto you what's what
[1:29:40] what things soever you desire When you
[1:29:43] pray believe that ye receive them and he
[1:29:46] shall have them
[1:29:57] and when you stand praying
[1:30:00] forgive if ye have ought against any
[1:30:03] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:30:06] May forgive your
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:20] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[1:30:24] neither will your father which is in
[1:30:25] heaven forgive your
[1:30:32] trespasses
[1:30:33] amen may you be seated may the Lord
[1:30:35] bless
[1:30:37] us as we hear his
[1:30:40] word so now
[1:30:43] Saints this morning I'm speaking to you
[1:30:45] on
[1:30:48] forgiveness
[1:30:51] forgiveness so this is a little pastoral
[1:30:53] message
[1:30:55] I do not intend to even be very long on
[1:30:58] it but I would like you to really give
[1:31:00] me your undivided
[1:31:03] attention step put as much as you
[1:31:06] can the Lord will bless you for
[1:31:09] that so now we see here that Jesus gives
[1:31:12] this little teaching to the uh to the
[1:31:17] disciples and he says that uh uh
[1:31:21] whatsoever whosoever that shall set to
[1:31:23] this mountain be there removed and be
[1:31:25] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:31:27] his heart but shall be believe those
[1:31:29] things which he has said it shall come
[1:31:31] to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:31:35] [Music]
[1:31:41] sayth therefore I say unto you whatever
[1:31:46] you
[1:31:47] desire When you pray believe that you
[1:31:50] receive them and he shall have them now
[1:31:53] I want to say this many of you have
[1:31:56] prayed and have asked God to do things
[1:31:58] in your life and God has not done
[1:32:03] it I would like to inform you this
[1:32:06] morning one of the reasons
[1:32:09] why is because in your heart you do not
[1:32:12] have
[1:32:14] forgiveness because faith is on the um
[1:32:18] uh faith is on the basis of
[1:32:22] forgiveness it sounds so good when you
[1:32:24] you're commanding a mountain and a
[1:32:26] mountain is removed from one place to
[1:32:31] another it sounds so good you know when
[1:32:34] you want something and you ask God and
[1:32:36] God provides it to
[1:32:40] you it sounds like so so that we have so
[1:32:43] much
[1:32:46] power but listen to me that he says when
[1:32:49] you start
[1:32:51] praying forgive so other words before
[1:32:54] you even begin
[1:32:56] praying you should
[1:32:58] forgive if you do not forgive he says
[1:33:02] your heavenly
[1:33:03] father will also not forgive your
[1:33:07] trespasses now we have so many people
[1:33:09] who claim to be
[1:33:11] Believers but in their heart they so
[1:33:14] filled with
[1:33:17] unforgiveness and and with a lot of
[1:33:19] things that even when they
[1:33:22] pray God canot accept their
[1:33:26] sacrifice you know they are
[1:33:28] hypocrites they
[1:33:30] Pharisees in their hearts but you know a
[1:33:33] Christian is supposed to be a person
[1:33:35] with a clean
[1:33:37] heart and we are supposed to stand pure
[1:33:40] in our mind and in our conscious in our
[1:33:42] approach to
[1:33:47] God because God answers
[1:33:49] prayer you believe God answers prayer
[1:33:53] how many God answ prayer say amen he
[1:33:56] answers prayer but why is it that so
[1:33:58] many of our prayers go and
[1:34:01] answer because we stand
[1:34:03] praying but with a heart full of
[1:34:06] gu but with a heart full of hatred with
[1:34:10] a heart full of
[1:34:11] unforgiveness with a heart full of
[1:34:15] Revenge a prophet in the message perfect
[1:34:19] Faith he says now faith is based on
[1:34:22] forgiveness
[1:34:25] tell your neighbor faith is best on
[1:34:28] forgiv so in other words you cannot you
[1:34:31] are faith cannot be put to
[1:34:34] work if you don't forgive no mountain
[1:34:37] will be removed at your
[1:34:40] prayer if you do not forgive you know
[1:34:44] you will speak to a
[1:34:46] mountain and a mountain will remain
[1:34:48] right
[1:34:50] there because in your heart you do not
[1:34:53] have
[1:34:54] forgiveness faith is based on
[1:34:58] forgiveness and then as we said this
[1:35:01] morning trying to get the church into
[1:35:03] the place to where we could really see
[1:35:06] the apostolic times moving Among
[1:35:13] Us that is what we all H
[1:35:16] for how many Hunger for
[1:35:19] that where you see the power of God
[1:35:22] moving
[1:35:23] where you see signs and wonders where
[1:35:25] you see moving where you see
[1:35:27] happen I don't know about you but really
[1:35:30] I I don't like this Gospel of just
[1:35:32] Doctrine and teaching but no power no
[1:35:34] moving of the Holy
[1:35:41] Ghost you know in my heart I Longing For
[1:35:44] the Dynamics I long for the
[1:35:46] Dynamics I long for the move of the Holy
[1:35:49] Ghost I long for healing to
[1:35:52] happen long for miracles to like the
[1:35:56] testimony we had here brother
[1:35:58] g i so happy when you come to a
[1:36:01] church and you have no job and you hear
[1:36:04] a brother
[1:36:06] testifying prayed for me and God gave me
[1:36:09] a job are you not so happy when you hear
[1:36:11] things like then you feel you are
[1:36:13] encouraged in your faith to also believe
[1:36:16] if God did it for them he will do it for
[1:36:20] me we want those Apostolic times to be
[1:36:23] among
[1:36:26] that's what we all hunger for and he
[1:36:28] says and it's just laying right at the
[1:36:33] door that power is right at the
[1:36:36] door we see it but we want to see more
[1:36:39] of
[1:36:41] it oh I want
[1:36:44] more we want it such we want it such a
[1:36:47] flow that it will be a help to
[1:36:51] us to flow out to
[1:36:56] others that can't
[1:36:58] happen without
[1:37:00] faith without faith it is impossible to
[1:37:04] please God you need Faith to move your
[1:37:07] Mountain you need Faith to make things
[1:37:09] happen in your life you need Faith to
[1:37:12] overcome demons and spirits that are are
[1:37:15] troubling
[1:37:16] you you need to move from the place
[1:37:19] where you are to the place where God
[1:37:20] wants you
[1:37:23] you need Faith to overcome your
[1:37:26] enemies you need Faith to overcome your
[1:37:29] your
[1:37:30] troubles faith it is impossible to
[1:37:33] please
[1:37:34] God but here he says faith is based on
[1:37:43] forgiveness so in other words if you do
[1:37:45] not forgive you stand in a place where
[1:37:49] you might actually have
[1:37:52] faith that faith is
[1:37:56] deactivated the power that activates
[1:37:58] your
[1:38:00] faith
[1:38:02] forgiveness if your heart is filled with
[1:38:06] bitterness if your heart is filled with
[1:38:08] hatred if your heart is filled with
[1:38:10] malice if your heart is filled with Envy
[1:38:14] are you hearing me if your heart is
[1:38:16] filled with
[1:38:17] jealousy then you you cannot forgive and
[1:38:21] if you cannot forgive you are going to
[1:38:23] be
[1:38:26] prayer you are
[1:38:28] praying comes back again to
[1:38:30] you it just comes back against you you
[1:38:33] have no
[1:38:35] access there is no entrance minister to
[1:38:37] you to reach the holy of
[1:38:41] holies because in your heart you have no
[1:38:45] you have no
[1:38:46] forgiveness what is
[1:38:49] forgiveness according to the
[1:38:51] dictionary forgiveness is find as a
[1:38:54] deliberate
[1:38:57] decision a deliberate
[1:39:01] decision to release feelings of
[1:39:08] resentment you decide on your own
[1:39:14] deliberately with an
[1:39:16] intention to release
[1:39:19] feelings of
[1:39:22] resentment of
[1:39:24] vengance toward a
[1:39:27] person or a group who has offended
[1:39:31] you
[1:39:33] regardless of whether they actually
[1:39:36] deserve your
[1:39:39] forgiveness now you have many believers
[1:39:42] who will come up and say I won't forgive
[1:39:45] them they have to come and repent and
[1:39:51] cry and SN and fall down and give me
[1:39:56] that actually in our
[1:39:59] cultures here in Africa for you to be
[1:40:03] forgiven there are certain
[1:40:07] prerequisites you have to
[1:40:10] fulfill if you have offended
[1:40:13] one you saw there was this man here in
[1:40:16] Uganda that that you know shot and
[1:40:18] killed a
[1:40:20] man and you know I Nally survived
[1:40:24] that
[1:40:26] man his name
[1:40:29] is and and and you know he he killed
[1:40:32] killed a
[1:40:33] man because that man you know reversed
[1:40:36] and and and knocked his
[1:40:40] car so there so he got out and shot
[1:40:44] him now I remember the same same thing
[1:40:48] happened between me and that man so I
[1:40:51] came out and asked him I said for
[1:40:54] and and you know because long story
[1:40:56] short I was just entering the
[1:40:58] mall and I was you know I had people
[1:41:01] making
[1:41:02] noise and I thought oh have I knocked a
[1:41:04] child so I quickly reversed and then I
[1:41:08] did not know that he was also coming and
[1:41:10] so I bumped into him and so when I came
[1:41:14] out I said forgive
[1:41:15] me he spoke very many Val words there
[1:41:19] and he said I cannot
[1:41:21] forgive I can't speak those words
[1:41:24] and he said you have to repair
[1:41:26] my he took me to Toyota
[1:41:29] Uganda and when I reached there he said
[1:41:32] you have to commit write a letter here
[1:41:33] you have to commit to
[1:41:37] everything and all the money I had in my
[1:41:41] life I spent it on
[1:41:43] his I'll never forget that day but did I
[1:41:47] forgive him surely I did forgive him did
[1:41:51] he forgive me I do not know but I doubt
[1:41:54] and the same same thing happened between
[1:41:56] him and another man shot him and now the
[1:42:00] family of that man
[1:42:02] said it has been the trending on the
[1:42:04] news how many have seen those
[1:42:06] news family said well for you for us to
[1:42:09] forgive you know you have to come and
[1:42:13] you bring I don't know how many
[1:42:15] bulls you know KNE down and this and do
[1:42:19] that and this is culture this is what it
[1:42:22] requires
[1:42:24] for a person to be for and you find that
[1:42:26] those kind of things also come down into
[1:42:28] the hearts of Christians
[1:42:33] Believers for me to
[1:42:35] forgive me I will never
[1:42:38] forgive you find a brother a
[1:42:41] sister me I will never forgive that
[1:42:46] person what they did to
[1:42:49] me I will I will never forgive and he's
[1:42:53] a brother he a sister speak
[1:42:56] like and others will be like if you want
[1:43:00] me to forgive you you have to come and
[1:43:03] leak my my my
[1:43:06] feet otherwise I I swear I will never
[1:43:11] forgive those words are coming out of
[1:43:13] what kind of
[1:43:15] heart I can almost tell you they are not
[1:43:18] coming out of the heart that is clean
[1:43:21] and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:25] amen if you can't say Amen it means you
[1:43:27] have that kind of
[1:43:29] heart are coming out of
[1:43:32] bitterness those are coming out of
[1:43:36] Vengeance the spirit of
[1:43:38] Vengeance you have done this to me I
[1:43:41] need to do this to you that's why people
[1:43:44] bewi
[1:43:45] others that's why people hate other you
[1:43:48] find someone hting someone with
[1:43:52] passion and when someone hats another
[1:43:55] one they even recruit others to H on
[1:43:58] their
[1:44:00] behalf you know can you imagine what
[1:44:03] that person did to me oh I can't even
[1:44:06] think about it whenever I think about I
[1:44:10] feel like going to
[1:44:11] them squeezing their neck but because
[1:44:15] I'm a Believer I forgave him you are
[1:44:18] lying you did not forgive them that is
[1:44:21] why you filled with bitterness
[1:44:23] you're filled with anger you need to
[1:44:26] receive a baptism of the Holy
[1:44:29] Ghost that it will bring you forgiveness
[1:44:31] in your soul in
[1:44:34] your that God will change you because if
[1:44:37] you don't forgive your faith will always
[1:44:40] be
[1:44:42] inactive whatever you do for the Lord
[1:44:44] you will never please
[1:44:46] him praise the name of the
[1:44:49] Lord and so there are three elements of
[1:44:52] forgiveness
[1:44:55] number one it has to be a deliberate
[1:45:01] action an intentional
[1:45:04] action you cannot forgive by
[1:45:11] accident no you can't you don't forgive
[1:45:16] someone because they have braed you
[1:45:23] you do something to somebody and they
[1:45:27] angry with you but then when you give
[1:45:29] them money they forgive
[1:45:32] you that's not
[1:45:34] forgiveness that's not
[1:45:36] forgiveness if you are going to forgive
[1:45:39] somebody it is a deliberate
[1:45:43] action you to release and
[1:45:47] dismiss feelings of
[1:45:51] resentment regard
[1:45:56] and also the other
[1:45:59] element is that
[1:46:01] forgiveness is usually done or given by
[1:46:05] the
[1:46:10] offended are you following me church are
[1:46:13] you following me Church forgiveness is
[1:46:16] usually given by the
[1:46:21] offended you didn't hear me
[1:46:23] that's why you didn't say Amen on
[1:46:26] forgiveness you hear many people say how
[1:46:30] do you tell me to forgive them they are
[1:46:33] the ones who did this thing to
[1:46:35] me they must
[1:46:38] come do
[1:46:40] ab then I forgive them no you have to
[1:46:45] forgive because you are
[1:46:48] offended now you tell me that is
[1:46:50] hard that is Christianity
[1:46:53] if it is hard for you then you have
[1:46:54] never been a
[1:46:57] Christian the offend and the other the
[1:46:59] other third
[1:47:02] element of
[1:47:03] forgiveness is that the
[1:47:07] offender does not have to deserve it
[1:47:12] first there is none of us that deserves
[1:47:17] forgiveness whoever offends
[1:47:20] another and offends them and make feel
[1:47:24] B it means that the other person they
[1:47:28] offended he has no justification all bis
[1:47:32] to begin to forgive that
[1:47:33] [Applause]
[1:47:39] person what you are telling me to
[1:47:41] forgive that
[1:47:42] person do you know what they have done
[1:47:45] to
[1:47:46] me do you know if you knew what they
[1:47:48] have done to me you would not be telling
[1:47:51] me to forgive
[1:47:53] no no I cannot so tell me who has done
[1:47:58] work that deserves to be
[1:48:01] forgiven are there small offenses and
[1:48:03] big
[1:48:05] offenses every offense is Big to the
[1:48:08] person who has been
[1:48:11] offended if you have been ever been
[1:48:13] offended lift up your
[1:48:16] hand as that offense was it small to
[1:48:20] you it changed your heart
[1:48:23] and the way you were looking at the
[1:48:25] person who offended you it made you feel
[1:48:28] bad about
[1:48:29] life it made you feel bad about
[1:48:33] yourself sometimes it made you feel like
[1:48:35] you are
[1:48:37] used by the person who has offended
[1:48:40] you but let me tell you the other
[1:48:43] element of
[1:48:45] forgiveness is that the offender usually
[1:48:47] doesn't have to deserve forgiveness
[1:48:53] but you
[1:48:55] deliberately you make up your mind and
[1:48:59] you
[1:49:00] decide release and
[1:49:03] dismiss feelings of resentment and hat
[1:49:07] and and you decide to give them the
[1:49:13] offender the one that doesn't deserve
[1:49:16] it you decide on your
[1:49:19] own to give them forgiveness
[1:49:23] hallelujah amen if we want to understand
[1:49:27] forgiveness we we can look at the
[1:49:30] Forgiveness we all have in
[1:49:34] Christ siners were fully
[1:49:38] released from God is just
[1:49:44] penalty all charges against
[1:49:47] us were
[1:49:50] dropped were dismissed
[1:49:53] all charges
[1:49:55] were all of them were
[1:49:57] dropped who deserved
[1:50:00] it none of us deserve his
[1:50:04] forgiveness we were so lost we were so
[1:50:08] undone amen but he
[1:50:11] decided to take it upon
[1:50:13] himself and forgive us we the ones that
[1:50:17] did not deserve
[1:50:19] it we the ones that deserved h
[1:50:23] but God the Bible says but God who was
[1:50:27] so rich in
[1:50:28] Mery he
[1:50:30] decided amen according to his own
[1:50:34] will amen we never begged him for it we
[1:50:38] never asked him for it but he decided
[1:50:42] according to the counil of his own will
[1:50:46] to
[1:50:47] deliberately forgive you deliberately
[1:50:52] dismiss all
[1:50:55] the
[1:50:56] Hallelujah glory to God Amen and that's
[1:51:00] what forgiveness
[1:51:01] is Romans 81
[1:51:04] says let now that's what I said but now
[1:51:08] we want to see what he himself
[1:51:13] says about your
[1:51:15] charges the Bible says we are all born
[1:51:17] in
[1:51:18] sin all Sheed in
[1:51:21] iniquity we come to the speaking
[1:51:23] L if you deserve
[1:51:26] forgiveness pleas
[1:51:28] forgiveness raise up your
[1:51:33] hand none of us you deserve
[1:51:38] forgiveness brother come up here brother
[1:51:41] this brother feels he deserves
[1:51:45] forgiveness why do you think you
[1:51:51] deserve you his
[1:51:53] forgiveness
[1:52:11] why do you have a
[1:52:16] bu a basis of what you have done to
[1:52:18] deserve forgiveness changed his mind
[1:52:23] so you actually believe you are so bad
[1:52:27] that even when he looks at you he should
[1:52:30] not forgive you but by his
[1:52:32] Mercy he can forgive you is it what you
[1:52:35] believe so you just like the rest of us
[1:52:39] we thought you were
[1:52:40] special we all the
[1:52:43] same we are all the same that's what I
[1:52:46] wanted to show you none of us can stand
[1:52:48] up and
[1:52:50] claim I deserve to
[1:52:54] for I deserve to be forgiven it's just
[1:52:57] like somebody giving you
[1:52:58] something and you say I deserved
[1:53:01] it I deserved it why I worked for him
[1:53:05] for so
[1:53:06] long so I deserved it but you know when
[1:53:10] someone gives you
[1:53:11] something and and and you you did not
[1:53:14] know them they did not know you you'll
[1:53:17] be
[1:53:18] like why do you give it to me sir
[1:53:21] because I love you
[1:53:23] I don't deserve it you would even reject
[1:53:26] it he would say please take it I decided
[1:53:29] to give it that's how God has given us
[1:53:32] forg we did not deserve
[1:53:35] it there is nothing we have done there
[1:53:39] is nothing we can do to receive his
[1:53:43] forgiveness to deserve it is all by
[1:53:49] Grace Hallelujah and he in his own
[1:53:53] word this is what it says to us Romans
[1:53:56] 81 there is there for
[1:53:59] now no
[1:54:01] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:54:05] Jesus who walk not after the
[1:54:08] flesh but after the spirit the Bible
[1:54:12] says that Satan is the accuser of the
[1:54:18] Brethren is the
[1:54:19] accuser he goes to God and he tells God
[1:54:24] so and so has done such and
[1:54:26] such but do you know what God the devil
[1:54:30] does know one thing that God through his
[1:54:34] Sovereign mercy and
[1:54:36] grace even though we were so
[1:54:40] undeserving he took away the
[1:54:42] condemnation from
[1:54:43] us and he said that is there for
[1:54:48] now no
[1:54:50] condemnation to them which are in
[1:54:53] regardless of what I did in my life I
[1:54:56] might have been so

[1:55:26] sins there is no small sin and big
[1:55:30] sin are you hearing me there is no small
[1:55:34] sin and big
[1:55:35] sin and we all are
[1:55:38] Sinners by
[1:55:40] default by Nature because of our first
[1:55:44] birth God who is so rich in
[1:55:47] Mercy oh we never begged for it butam

[2:00:25] consolation of sin's
[2:00:29] penalty Hallelujah your sin was so great

[2:03:07] it is
[2:03:08] impossible why because the blood was
[2:03:12] shed for me to go to hell it means the
[2:03:16] blood was
[2:03:18] valueless but the blood was already sh
[2:03:23] and this

[2:04:04] value someone did not even receive that
[2:04:08] Revelation but someone is is about to
[2:04:10] get
[2:04:11] it if you go to a shop my brother to buy
[2:04:15] something it means you are willing to
[2:04:18] give away
[2:04:20] something for this one which means what
[2:04:24] you are getting is of more value to
[2:04:28] you let me announce let me announce to

[2:09:32] he says what the church needs
[2:09:34] tonight is a
[2:09:37] confession and making right to come back
[2:09:40] to the testimonies of the Lord
[2:09:44] God there is
[2:09:46] Mercy there is forgiveness
[2:09:51] seems that it would have it would haunt
[2:09:53] people going on know that you are
[2:09:55] walking hour by hour in the face of
[2:10:04] death why do we continue on with
[2:10:09] selfishness any time you can die
[2:10:12] brother any time you can die
[2:10:15] sister any time you will be gone
[2:10:21] you may you are here today but you may
[2:10:22] not be here
[2:10:24] tomorrow we are walking right in the
[2:10:26] face of
[2:10:27] death so why do you continue the
[2:10:31] selfishness why do you continue with
[2:10:34] greed why do you continue with
[2:10:37] ungodliness and he says our eyes on
[2:10:40] things of the
[2:10:42] world it is time we turn back to God's
[2:10:47] test hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:10:51] forgiveness listen to me Saints
[2:10:53] listen
[2:10:55] forgiveness is a
[2:10:59] demonstration of a
[2:11:04] will is a demonstration of a
[2:11:09] will not a sure of
[2:11:15] weakness let me come to you for just a
[2:11:19] moment many people think
[2:11:22] that if you forgive
[2:11:24] someone it means you are
[2:11:26] weak and they have
[2:11:30] W I don't know how many have been having
[2:11:34] that you feel like you are weak and the
[2:11:38] other person has
[2:11:40] W and some it is true some people feel
[2:11:43] that way they play around with
[2:11:47] somebody they just even when you they
[2:11:49] can't even repent they can't even
[2:11:52] confess and you have to force them and
[2:11:56] eventually they will say okay if if you
[2:11:58] feel I've done something but forgive
[2:12:02] me brother you will you be you will
[2:12:05] answer for
[2:12:06] that you will answer for
[2:12:11] that that is the purchase of the blood
[2:12:13] you're playing
[2:12:16] with but don't worry if he's a
[2:12:19] winner don't worry
[2:12:22] don't worry he may win here but he may
[2:12:25] not win
[2:12:26] there but you as a brother you as a
[2:12:29] sister it is not a show of
[2:12:34] weakness Christ did not grant us
[2:12:37] forgiveness because we deserved
[2:12:41] it we did not deserve it we all have sin
[2:12:44] and have come short of the glory of
[2:12:48] God he however deliberately forgave us
[2:12:51] as a deliberate Act of
[2:12:57] [Music]
[2:12:58] Love liberate show of
[2:13:03] Grace
[2:13:05] love now when I say that some people
[2:13:09] feel like oh I want to forgive my
[2:13:12] Del that's not forgiveness that is sin
[2:13:18] imorality the you remember what did
[2:13:22] some brothers are
[2:13:24] deceived you you are in connection with
[2:13:27] with
[2:13:29] a and she keeps trapping you and each
[2:13:32] time you come up you realize trapped you
[2:13:35] the Philistines are there and then you
[2:13:38] realize
[2:13:39] ah okay I'm forgiven you I'm a
[2:13:44] Believer next time I
[2:13:46] forg she's out to take your soul
[2:13:53] don't twist what I'm preaching
[2:13:55] today the Forgiveness I'm preaching
[2:13:58] about is you not having bitterness in
[2:14:00] your
[2:14:01] heart against someone who has truly
[2:14:04] offended
[2:14:07] you despite our
[2:14:10] sins he forgave
[2:14:13] us now I'd like us to look at John
[2:14:19] 19:3 he says
[2:14:22] when Jesus had received the vinegar he
[2:14:26] said it is finished and he bowed his
[2:14:28] head and gave up
[2:14:40] the now Jesus said it is
[2:14:44] finished Jesus knew what was
[2:14:48] finished Jesus fully paid our de of
[2:14:54] sin the word it is finished here
[2:14:57] symbolizes all our
[2:15:01] sins all our
[2:15:05] trespasses all our
[2:15:07] iniquities all our
[2:15:09] transgressions are
[2:15:12] permanently erased
[2:15:19] without in Psalms chapter 1 103:2 he
[2:15:22] says as far as the East is from the
[2:15:28] West so
[2:15:30] far has he removed our transgressions
[2:15:34] amen our transgressions from
[2:15:38] us he has removed our
[2:15:41] transgression when he said it is
[2:15:43] finished he taken our
[2:15:46] transgressions by the neck and he pull
[2:15:49] it away
[2:15:51] as far as is is from the
[2:15:56] W oh my what
[2:15:59] savior savior he took our sins far from
[2:16:06] us as a matter of fact a prophet says in
[2:16:09] In Living dying burried Rising coming he
[2:16:11] says when anything is
[2:16:14] bured it is hid it is out of
[2:16:19] sight and
[2:16:22] he carried my sins far
[2:16:26] away God can see our sins no
[2:16:30] more so they are
[2:16:32] buried I'm talking about you who has
[2:16:34] repented and confessed before
[2:16:39] him your sins
[2:16:41] areed your sins God cannot see them no
[2:16:45] more you ask me is God
[2:16:48] blind yeah God Is Blind to one thing
[2:16:52] God Is Blind to confess
[2:16:55] sin hallelujah amen that is the only
[2:16:59] thing the devil is better than
[2:17:05] God the devil can see your
[2:17:08] sins even when you have confessed them
[2:17:11] even when you have repented before God
[2:17:13] the devil can see them but to God he
[2:17:18] will never see them the moment you
[2:17:20] confess
[2:17:21] he can ever see them so the devil will
[2:17:24] go to him the devil is the
[2:17:27] accuser so he will go to God and have
[2:17:30] you seen what he I can't see where is it
[2:17:35] I can't see what am I talking about God
[2:17:38] Is Blind to the sins that are under the
[2:17:44] blood hallelujah amen that's why we say
[2:17:47] leave your sins for the blood to cover
[2:17:51] you should confess your sins when you do
[2:17:54] wrong when you live wrong always come
[2:17:58] back before God and put yourself right
[2:18:01] before
[2:18:02] him never sit
[2:18:07] comfortably the moment you do that
[2:18:09] you'll be spiritually
[2:18:12] dead you find someone who was on
[2:18:16] fire clapping his hands and saying Amen
[2:18:18] in the
[2:18:19] church behaving as if you're power
[2:18:23] isol they can't even say an
[2:18:26] amen why because that sin is finishing
[2:18:31] them God can see it the devil can see
[2:18:35] it and can see unconfessed
[2:18:40] sins can be seen by
[2:18:44] everyone
[2:18:46] yourself God and the devil but if you
[2:18:50] confess your sins and you repent of your
[2:18:53] sins you know what you may still see
[2:18:56] them you are human the devil will always
[2:18:59] see them he made you do
[2:19:03] them but God can't see
[2:19:07] them Hallelujah someone come to you say
[2:19:11] you did this oh yes I did because you
[2:19:15] remember but God
[2:19:17] doesn't and you will tell them I am no
[2:19:20] longer the person I
[2:19:24] used God can see our sins no
[2:19:27] more for they
[2:19:29] areed they areed where in the sea of
[2:19:36] forgetfulness Hallelujah think of a sea
[2:19:39] of
[2:19:41] forgetfulness God cannot remember them
[2:19:43] no
[2:19:44] more because they are both dead and
[2:19:47] buried it cannot be even remembered no
[2:19:50] more
[2:19:52] they are out of God's
[2:19:55] memory are you not so happy because of

[2:20:12] heaven with the kind of life you

[2:20:23] there was something a stri of
[2:20:28] blood anyone who crosses
[2:20:31] that it cleanses God's
[2:20:36] memory all that you did in your
[2:20:40] past and the Bible says walk in them no

[2:20:48] forgiveness

[2:28:28] things
[2:28:29] of even when you hear something that is
[2:28:33] sincerely
[2:28:34] true about a brother or a sister it is
[2:28:38] your
[2:28:39] duty to protect them by all
[2:28:45] means by all means by protecting them
[2:28:49] you are protecting
[2:28:53] yourself killing
[2:28:55] somebody is not getting a sword and
[2:28:58] Pi our Prophet told us it is talking
[2:29:02] about a
[2:29:05] brother he said no matter what you do
[2:29:09] never speak evil against a
[2:29:11] brother if someone comes and asks
[2:29:15] you tell me
[2:29:20] how is he brother om some people ask
[2:29:22] those
[2:29:23] things not because they love brother
[2:29:26] om but because they had some
[2:29:30] rumors and they know that you were close
[2:29:32] to
[2:29:49] them e
[2:30:27] person will begin boiling down the
[2:30:31] information he has had he will keep it
[2:30:33] for one week and the second week it will
[2:30:36] be very heavy for him he'll go to
[2:30:39] another
[2:30:40] one my sister you know you you are like
[2:30:43] my
[2:30:47] sister yeah don't you of course you know
[2:30:49] you can trust
[2:30:51] now I'm going to tell you this don't
[2:30:53] tell
[2:31:00] anyone and some sisters especially
[2:31:03] women the moment words
[2:31:06] come it's going to walk like a
[2:31:11] virus that's the
[2:31:13] truth sister is that not
[2:31:16] true I'm not talking I'm you you are
[2:31:18] very good talking about women
[2:31:21] generally don't I'm saying don't you
[2:31:23] know women
[2:31:29] that's like a
[2:31:31] virus and the church will become
[2:31:36] sick
[2:31:39] sick
[2:31:48] wounded because they allow
[2:31:51] the of
[2:31:55] gossip but where does it all begin
[2:31:58] from one thing lack of
[2:32:02] forgiveness if Believers were more
[2:32:06] forgiving let me tell you we would not
[2:32:07] have
[2:32:09] goel forgiveness in the
[2:32:13] family a brother forgiving his
[2:32:16] wife the wife forgiving a husband
[2:32:20] you know learning to forgive one
[2:32:22] another learning to work together in
[2:32:25] tenderness forbearing one
[2:32:29] another any have a
[2:32:32] [Applause]
[2:32:34] against is it possible for a brother to
[2:32:37] have a qu against another brother
[2:32:41] yes but he says
[2:32:45] forgive if you have a forgive one
[2:32:47] another even as Christ forgive
[2:32:51] you so do you
[2:32:54] also in First
[2:32:56] Corinthians
[2:32:58] 1 I read from the Amplified it says it
[2:33:01] is not
[2:33:02] rude it is not
[2:33:04] self-seeking it is not provoked it's
[2:33:08] talking about Love Char it's not rude
[2:33:12] it's not self-seeking is not provoked
[2:33:15] nor overly sensitive and easily angered
[2:33:26] anded it does not now this is the point
[2:33:28] here it does not take into account a
[2:33:31] wrong
[2:33:34] endured you you know keeping
[2:33:41] records of what the person did
[2:33:44] for you know what they did to you last
[2:33:47] year in the month of January the month
[2:33:50] of March the month of Fe and
[2:33:53] December and you keep that fight Pi
[2:33:55] another
[2:33:58] fight and you record all those things
[2:34:00] some of you have those
[2:34:02] records of the wrongs that you you have
[2:34:05] endured
[2:34:07] from love is not that way love is
[2:34:12] kind in Matthew
[2:34:14] 18:21 the scripture says then came Peter
[2:34:17] unto him and said Lord how
[2:34:20] how of shall I shall my brother sin
[2:34:22] against me and I forgive
[2:34:26] him seven
[2:34:29] times Jesus said unto him I say not unto
[2:34:33] I I I say not unto thee until seven
[2:34:36] times but until 70 times
[2:34:43] seven so I say if you cannot forgive
[2:34:46] someone it shows you hold anger
[2:34:50] it shows you have bitterness it shows
[2:34:52] you have
[2:34:54] resentment and I'm mature all growing
[2:34:58] believer should not have place for those
[2:35:00] in their
[2:35:03] heart praise the name of the Lord you
[2:35:06] know this reminds me you know brother I
[2:35:07] saw brother brother OK online I don't
[2:35:09] know where they still
[2:35:11] online Ethiopia you know it even goes
[2:35:14] from person to
[2:35:17] person to to to it goes from that even
[2:35:21] to you know nation and cultur and
[2:35:26] tri you know when I I was in the north
[2:35:29] there I found almost all their
[2:35:31] livelihood is taken from
[2:35:34] them you know the government came and
[2:35:37] wiped out people and killed people
[2:35:39] almost like
[2:35:41] a so I just felt you know to speak this
[2:35:44] to those Brothers over
[2:35:46] there forgiveness that comes from the
[2:35:49] level of a Believer down
[2:35:53] here even to a
[2:35:56] nation imagine you see a
[2:35:59] government that has almost taken away
[2:36:02] everything from
[2:36:03] you what do you do do you Hur them for
[2:36:07] life if you do
[2:36:09] that you won't have your faith won't be
[2:36:13] activated you have to
[2:36:16] forgive you forgive them you let it go
[2:36:20] praise the name of the Lord in first
[2:36:24] John the Bible says if we say that we
[2:36:26] have we have not seen we deceive
[2:36:30] ourselves and the truth is not in us but
[2:36:33] if we confess our sin he is faithful and
[2:36:36] just to forgive us our
[2:36:39] sins and to cleanse us from all
[2:36:43] unrighteous he is
[2:36:46] quick some people say I'll forgive you
[2:36:50] but give me some
[2:36:52] time he is faithful and is
[2:36:55] just to forgive our
[2:36:58] sin if we confess them he forgives us
[2:37:01] the moment we
[2:37:04] confess the moment we
[2:37:07] ADM he forgives us
[2:37:09] immed what about you you tell your
[2:37:12] brother it's all right I'll forgive you
[2:37:15] but give me some
[2:37:17] time some time for what
[2:37:20] anger is brooding in
[2:37:23] you bitterness is brooding in you still
[2:37:26] resent that
[2:37:28] person some of you are even married but
[2:37:31] you're still quaring within
[2:37:34] you and the children see
[2:37:39] that did you know we are having a
[2:37:43] generation that is no longer interested
[2:37:45] to get
[2:37:47] married I've increased seen
[2:37:52] that why because of the
[2:37:55] parents the marriages they've
[2:37:58] seen they've seen they have no interest
[2:38:01] in those
[2:38:03] things someone has grown up seeing
[2:38:06] especially here in Africa seeing a
[2:38:09] father beating a
[2:38:11] mother and is the one who always goes
[2:38:14] there no don't fight don't
[2:38:17] fight now tell that
[2:38:20] boy or that guy to get
[2:38:26] married what are you talking
[2:38:28] about marries for the
[2:38:31] we but let me tell you brethen let not
[2:38:34] the world Define
[2:38:37] us it's not what the world thinks I can
[2:38:41] do what the world says I can
[2:38:44] do what the promises of the word are
[2:38:49] and the Bible actually God tells us that
[2:38:51] marriage is a
[2:38:53] blessing and we must keep it that
[2:38:56] way the married where are you say
[2:39:00] Amen must keep it that
[2:39:02] way you must show love to your
[2:39:05] wife is it important for me to show love
[2:39:07] to my
[2:39:08] wife yes it is important is it important
[2:39:12] for God to show us
[2:39:13] love yes if he forgive us he shows us
[2:39:16] love every day of our Liv
[2:39:19] there it's not only in the
[2:39:21] honeymoon it is past
[2:39:24] honeymoon past years and
[2:39:26] years that is the love we have between
[2:39:29] us and
[2:39:30] Christ Even in our marriages those of
[2:39:33] you who are
[2:39:34] married should continue
[2:39:37] permanently by the way I always tell
[2:39:39] people you don't fall in love you grow
[2:39:42] in
[2:39:45] love you thought you loved them much of
[2:39:48] that was
[2:39:51] much of it but when you
[2:39:53] begin as when you begin in
[2:39:57] Christ you
[2:39:59] Contin grow in that love you continually
[2:40:03] grow in
[2:40:04] that quite frankly I tell you the
[2:40:07] truth 11 years
[2:40:10] pass but if it's a
[2:40:12] feeling I feel that I love my wife more
[2:40:15] than I loved 11
[2:40:21] when I was young I was young and
[2:40:24] foolish at some point I was looking at
[2:40:26] people who lose their
[2:40:28] wives I'm like oh they're getting an
[2:40:30] opportunity to
[2:40:33] change getting another wife and another
[2:40:35] one and I was like I don't know how many
[2:40:37] I will have in my
[2:40:39] life that was
[2:40:41] foolishness but now I look back at that
[2:40:43] and say I must have been foolish I did
[2:40:47] not know what it means
[2:40:49] 10 years into
[2:40:53] marriage if I lose her I will never
[2:40:56] marry
[2:40:58] again it is difficult you you become one
[2:41:02] with a
[2:41:03] person born
[2:41:06] together and marriage is a sum of all
[2:41:09] the Forgiveness that you give to one
[2:41:12] another every single day in that
[2:41:14] marriage
[2:41:20] almost every single
[2:41:23] day but you find people who are in
[2:41:25] marriage and every day they will face
[2:41:29] East and
[2:41:30] West every day because they
[2:41:34] are by something by something by
[2:41:36] something I made up a declaration I said
[2:41:38] when I was
[2:41:40] beginning if there is if there is a qu
[2:41:43] the Bible says use the word here
[2:41:46] a misunder understanding
[2:41:50] between me and my wife that we will not
[2:41:53] sleep over
[2:41:56] it at least we should sleep at 3 or 4
[2:42:00] a.m. in the
[2:42:04] morning but we must handle
[2:42:08] that because what if Jesus comes that
[2:42:12] night you've not forgiven one
[2:42:15] another husband and wife you will go
[2:42:17] both to both of you
[2:42:20] you make it the Rapture you may not go
[2:42:22] to hell you will not make it the Rapture
[2:42:26] you will miss
[2:42:27] out because you are not clean and in
[2:42:30] your heart you have anger you have
[2:42:32] bitterness you have
[2:42:34] resentment I believe that forgiveness is
[2:42:37] a will something that you decide to
[2:42:41] do NE the other party deserves it or
[2:42:45] not now
[2:42:49] in Luke 17
[2:42:51] verse1 it says
[2:43:33] I'm I'm pleading with you Saints don't
[2:43:36] just listen to these things and
[2:43:39] go practice this sumon
[2:43:43] today after you get out begin
[2:43:46] immediately begin correcting the mess
[2:43:50] forgiving one
[2:43:51] another said here if a brother has
[2:43:54] trespassed against you go and tell
[2:43:58] him don't just I'll keep it to myself
[2:44:02] keep and bitterness in your
[2:44:04] heart go to him do you
[2:44:09] remember you offended
[2:44:14] me I am
[2:44:16] Sor the problem
[2:44:37] forgive
[2:44:52] but here he said one thing I want to
[2:44:54] highlight
[2:44:56] here offenses will
[2:45:00] come they will always come but why unto
[2:45:05] him through whom they
[2:45:09] come there are some people who don't
[2:45:12] fear any
[2:45:15] danger they are always the ones to bring
[2:45:18] an offense
[2:45:20] always you the one you are always the
[2:45:22] one why do you want to offend
[2:45:25] Brothers offenses will
[2:45:28] come nonetheless when a brother
[2:45:31] repents forgive tell your neighbor
[2:45:35] forgive let them
[2:45:37] forgive hallelujah praise the name of
[2:45:40] the
[2:45:41] Lord
[2:45:45] amen I just want to find a place to
[2:45:48] finish here
[2:45:50] I want to give you two
[2:45:52] examples of the people having the spirit
[2:45:55] of
[2:45:57] forgiveness and the spirit of
[2:45:58] forgiveness is the spirit of
[2:46:01] Christ in Luke
[2:46:05] 23:33 says and when they were come to
[2:46:07] the place which is called Calvary There
[2:46:10] They Crucified him and the male factors
[2:46:12] one of one on the right and the other on
[2:46:14] the left then said Jesus father forgive
[2:46:18] them for they know not what they do and
[2:46:20] they parted his rment and cast
[2:46:41] lots this is a man that come to save the
[2:46:45] sinners from their
[2:46:50] he was F falsely
[2:46:52] accused you know they they took him to
[2:46:55] the
[2:46:56] Cross they beat him up they tore up
[2:46:59] his and at the end of it all what would
[2:47:03] you think he would
[2:47:05] say I wonder if one of us
[2:47:10] here was to replace Christ on the
[2:47:14] cross I wonder what she would
[2:47:17] say if you are the one being
[2:47:19] beaten when you fely
[2:47:23] accused about two three
[2:47:25] times I've survived being
[2:47:29] caught in China once in Ethiopia about
[2:47:33] twice you know taken being I was almost
[2:47:36] taken to
[2:47:37] jail for preaching Christ but I wondered
[2:47:41] each
[2:47:41] moment I go back in the room and
[2:47:44] say what if I was caught
[2:47:49] what would I
[2:47:50] do in China I remember that one clearly
[2:47:53] I was ready to
[2:47:56] die accepted I remember that's the
[2:47:59] closest I came
[2:48:00] to of course if they catch you
[2:48:03] preaching you
[2:48:05] gone that one I remember but
[2:48:09] Ethiopia several times I was ready to be
[2:48:13] caught in Tanzania I almost died but
[2:48:17] each of these times
[2:48:20] the people these people are filled with
[2:48:22] anger they don't know even what they
[2:48:24] doing because they preaching the gospel
[2:48:26] of
[2:48:28] life but they get anger because you are
[2:48:30] preaching against what they
[2:48:33] believe and and you know Jesus he was
[2:48:37] caught and he was beaten and he was
[2:48:40] taken to the Cross if it was you what
[2:48:43] would you
[2:48:46] do what would you do some of you with
[2:48:49] the bitterness and the anger you
[2:48:52] have you would have Cur like Peter
[2:48:55] did you remember Peter was when they
[2:48:57] wanted to catch him Peter
[2:49:00] cast Peter a brother an apostle he cast
[2:49:06] and rejected Christ with
[2:49:09] passion when this was but you were one
[2:49:12] of wrong with
[2:49:13] you get away from never seen
[2:49:20] but Jesus being who he was he showed us
[2:49:25] the way of a
[2:49:27] Believer after they did everything to
[2:49:30] him they spot on him they beat him they
[2:49:35] they rejected him they accused him
[2:49:37] falsely Hallelujah at the end of it all
[2:49:40] he said
[2:49:42] father forgive them they know not what
[2:49:46] they
[2:49:47] do that is the spirit of
[2:49:50] Christ and if the spirit of Christ is in
[2:49:53] you you will do the same same
[2:49:57] thing the people may do all things to
[2:50:00] you but that's you you have no
[2:50:04] words father forgive
[2:50:07] them others when they say father forgive
[2:50:09] them they're like they meaning God judge
[2:50:16] them have you not seen them
[2:50:19] when they offended do you know who I am
[2:50:22] I'm a Child of
[2:50:23] God may God forgive you but really they
[2:50:28] mean God Revenge
[2:50:31] you that's not the spirit of Christ let
[2:50:34] me show you what the spirit
[2:50:35] of Acts 7 verse 58 will end with
[2:50:40] this and cast him now they're talking
[2:50:43] about St Steven and how they cast him
[2:50:45] out of the city and stoned him
[2:50:50] and the witnesses laid down their
[2:50:51] clothes at a young man's
[2:50:55] feet whose name was s this man Sten was
[2:50:59] preaching by the way and he preached and
[2:51:02] he he starred their hearts and he
[2:51:04] grieved them
[2:51:06] them and when those things
[2:51:09] happened then you know they stoned him
[2:51:13] they dashed his head in and kill him
[2:51:16] took his CLS and
[2:51:19] and and and put it On's
[2:51:22] feet who later became Apostle
[2:51:25] Paul but at this time he was still s I
[2:51:28] want to show you the effect of
[2:51:31] forgiveness and they sted Steven calling
[2:51:35] upon
[2:51:35] God Steven while they was stoning him
[2:51:38] was calling upon
[2:51:41] God saying Lord Jesus receive my
[2:51:46] spirit and he kneeled down
[2:51:49] and he cried with a loud
[2:51:52] voice let not this sin to their
[2:51:58] church and when he had said
[2:52:00] this he fell asleep he
[2:52:04] died did you hear what St
[2:52:08] did he forgave
[2:52:11] them he forgave
[2:52:14] them same thing with the church history
[2:52:18] was Mar or
[2:52:21] some you know how they came to you know
[2:52:24] to to kill him but he told he told him
[2:52:27] wait give me some time let me first I
[2:52:30] think it was two hours or
[2:52:32] something he started praying praying for
[2:52:35] his captain pray for his enemy pray for
[2:52:38] the king for his
[2:52:40] enemies and and also his
[2:52:42] brothers but you if you had a chance and
[2:52:45] someone was killing you because of the
[2:52:46] Gospel
[2:52:50] you first pray for 30
[2:52:52] minutes you just pray for
[2:52:55] your help me to
[2:52:57] go and then you pray for your
[2:52:59] children when I die let them not
[2:53:02] suffer and then remember your mother and
[2:53:05] your grandmother and also your wife and
[2:53:09] also you remember all those ones and now
[2:53:12] you can now you can
[2:53:15] take you don't remember your enemies
[2:53:18] how many of us when we pray we pray for
[2:53:20] our
[2:53:22] enemies if you don't pray for your
[2:53:24] enemies you are not a full
[2:53:28] Christian that brother you don't like
[2:53:31] that sister you don't like pray for them
[2:53:35] and when you are praying for them don't
[2:53:37] say God may you rebuke them you work on
[2:53:40] them Believers don't pray such
[2:53:44] prayers we pray for them what we want
[2:53:47] God to do for us
[2:53:50] that's why some of you are
[2:53:52] miserable because God is bringing the
[2:53:54] prayers that you pray for your enemies
[2:53:55] on
[2:53:58] you let the prayers you pray for your
[2:54:01] enemies be upon you in Jesus
[2:54:06] name that means if you're not saying
[2:54:08] amen you're not praying good prayers for
[2:54:11] them oh may you get a change today in
[2:54:14] this
[2:54:15] service from today begin praying good
[2:54:18] things for your
[2:54:20] enemies amen pray for them God to bless
[2:54:24] them God to reveal himself to them pray
[2:54:27] for God to forgive them their sins pray
[2:54:30] for God to prosper
[2:54:32] them if your enemies
[2:54:35] Prosper is not a problem to you it is a
[2:54:38] blessing to
[2:54:39] you because some of those enemies of
[2:54:42] yours are your enemies because you are
[2:54:45] prospering and they poor
[2:54:49] so if God prospers them then they will
[2:54:52] never be your enemies
[2:54:53] again can you see you are all
[2:54:57] winning we have to have an attitude of
[2:55:00] Christ have to have a heart of a
[2:55:03] Christian a heart of a
[2:55:06] Believer some people have bad hearts bad
[2:55:10] attitudes whenever they see someone
[2:55:12] prospering someone
[2:55:14] happy they feel bad they're like oh God
[2:55:19] that man they always wish I wish
[2:55:22] something bad would happen they can't
[2:55:25] say it but they think
[2:55:27] it it's a bad attitude it's a wrong
[2:55:32] Spirit you should have the spirit of
[2:55:34] Step Steven whereby he
[2:55:37] prayed for these who had killed
[2:55:40] him just before he died he said Lord do
[2:55:43] not lay this sin on their
[2:55:45] church one of those people
[2:55:48] was
[2:55:50] sa he end up being Apostle
[2:55:53] Paul because of
[2:55:59] forgiveness if Steven had not prayed a
[2:56:01] prayer of
[2:56:04] forgiveness you will not be saved
[2:56:08] today you see how powerful
[2:56:10] forgiveness one man
[2:56:13] forgive and the entire gender
[2:56:16] dispensation receive
[2:56:20] would come out of
[2:56:21] that and receive the grace of God and
[2:56:25] the calling of
[2:56:27] God he said I'm the Apostle to the
[2:56:29] Gentiles he preached all over the world
[2:56:32] and we receive the Gospel because of
[2:56:35] apostle Paul why because one brother who
[2:56:39] was offended by
[2:56:41] Paul forgave Paul forgave others
[2:56:45] who the the man actually it is said I
[2:56:50] don't know whether it is Cornelius or
[2:56:51] somebody else but there was a man one of
[2:56:54] them who actually pierced Jesus's
[2:56:59] side but Jesus prayed he said father for
[2:57:03] them among them the
[2:57:06] soldiers they got
[2:57:09] saved friends we should have an attitude
[2:57:12] of Jesus
[2:57:14] Christ we forgive one another we should
[2:57:17] forbear one another
[2:57:20] I know these kind of sermons don't
[2:57:22] excite many people because they feel
[2:57:23] like they're being
[2:57:27] rusted but if I'm going to be your
[2:57:29] pastor I'm going to tell you the Bible
[2:57:34] truth and this Bible truth will set us

[3:20:22] for just a
[3:20:30] [Music]
[3:20:37] moment with every eye
[3:20:40] closed is the holy spirit that convicts
[3:20:43] man of sin
[3:20:46] I can present the Bible truths to
[3:20:50] you but it takes the spirit of
[3:20:53] God to convict you of what you
[3:20:59] done now with every eye close every head
[3:21:06] bow maybe you've been struggling with
[3:21:11] [Music]
[3:21:12] unforgiveness I tell you brother
[3:21:15] sister if you not overcome
[3:21:18] this it's going to hinder your prayers
[3:21:20] to
[3:21:23] God it's going to hinder your
[3:21:27] faith it will render it useless
[3:21:32] powerless but if you can receive
[3:21:35] forgiveness in your
[3:21:38] heart you will receive a
[3:21:43] breakthrough you will activate that
[3:21:45] faith in you
[3:21:49] things that were difficult and
[3:21:52] impossible will become possible
[3:21:56] eventually all you need to
[3:21:59] do is to make up your
[3:22:02] mind to have a
[3:22:05] decision to
[3:22:07] forgive now the other party may not
[3:22:10] deserve it for
[3:22:11] [Music]
[3:22:13] sure but that doesn't matter
[3:22:16] it's your
[3:22:17] choice it's the choice you
[3:22:21] make to forgive the other
[3:22:25] person and to release
[3:22:28] yourself from that
[3:22:30] anger from that
[3:22:33] [Music]
[3:22:39] bitterness I want to how many are here
[3:22:41] today like
[3:22:43] that I'd like to pray with you as we
[3:22:45] close

[3:22:51] and say

[3:30:50] God bless you
[3:30:52] Church
[3:30:53] yeah this is from Brother
[3:30:57] Isaac ISAC yeah brother Isaac is the
[3:31:01] bride to
[3:31:02] be the groom to
[3:31:06] be yeah so he's requesting all the
[3:31:09] members of this
[3:31:12] church in fact all of us we all in
[3:31:16] brother
[3:31:19] is's the one heading the media
[3:31:25] team believe that he's doing a
[3:31:27] tremendous
[3:31:29] work so kindly uh if you are going to he
[3:31:34] want all of us to be
[3:31:37] there but you requested kind to
[3:31:42] register yeah you're going to confirm
[3:31:44] your presence there with
[3:31:51] God bless
[3:31:55] you now I would like to clarify
[3:31:58] something
[3:32:00] here I know I've heard statements like
[3:32:03] some of these young people are proud
[3:32:04] what
[3:32:06] what the young man told me what he was
[3:32:08] planning to
[3:32:10] do I told him I think it is okay in some
[3:32:14] of this developed countries they do
[3:32:16] [Music]
[3:32:18] things it is called
[3:32:20] [Music]
[3:32:23] RVP I don't know what the word in full
[3:32:26] but it means respond so we can know you
[3:32:28] are coming so we can prepare
[3:32:32] for to the extent if you you said you
[3:32:35] are coming only one and you come with
[3:32:37] two more people they will have no seats
[3:32:44] for because everything is prepared and
[3:32:47] booked and
[3:32:50] aranged so so I think it is a if we can
[3:32:53] adopt some of these things it will help
[3:32:56] us most of us are young
[3:33:07] people most of you can do
[3:33:09] this so um I think we can adopt it
[3:33:16] I'm coming with this number of people my
[3:33:20] contribution is this
[3:33:21] much paying it on this
[3:33:23] de the person can also know but now when
[3:33:26] we go CU I've been with most of these
[3:33:27] young people when we are planning for
[3:33:30] weddings and when we go to the venue we
[3:33:33] talking to the service
[3:33:35] providers the question is how many
[3:33:40] people and then you begin
[3:33:43] um 80 90 Maybe
[3:33:48] and then shortly before he said no no
[3:33:51] no and then some people
[3:33:54] promising 200 and then eventually they
[3:33:57] become
[3:33:59] 300 that's Africa for you but I think we
[3:34:03] can change that how many agree with me
[3:34:05] we can change that I believe we can
[3:34:07] change that last youth meetings we made
[3:34:11] a
[3:34:13] record we we I think about
[3:34:18] 300 that was a
[3:34:21] record it was the first time it has
[3:34:23] happened and the first time we said okay
[3:34:26] but a few almost
[3:34:28] n so 3 and 500
[3:34:32] came but I remember I talked to them
[3:34:36] this time we will be very
[3:34:39] strict when someone doesn't
[3:34:44] register we will not serve them we will
[3:34:46] not give them
[3:34:48] priority because we want to prepare and
[3:34:50] arrange accommodation
[3:34:53] this so if someone doesn't how can you
[3:34:58] take so this youth meetings we are going
[3:35:01] to be very
[3:35:03] strict the good thing it is youth
[3:35:06] meetings they can
[3:35:10] learn so I think we should adopt this
[3:35:13] these things
[3:35:16] I was talking to Brother David
[3:35:18] mayor May on our last youth
[3:35:22] meetings he told me uh looks like you
[3:35:26] you are having more than you
[3:35:30] expected I said well what happened is
[3:35:33] when we
[3:35:35] registered
[3:35:37] regra not everyone
[3:35:39] registered so many show up on the last
[3:35:42] minute he was very shocked
[3:35:45] how then can you take care of
[3:35:47] them so in their countries which are far
[3:35:50] developed more than
[3:35:52] ours is a
[3:35:54] shock for you to just show
[3:35:57] up it is it is
[3:36:00] shocking how come you never informed
[3:36:04] us you know but for us even a relative
[3:36:07] can come from the village and visit you
[3:36:10] together with some of I don't know how
[3:36:12] many
[3:36:17] and they sit there you want them go
[3:36:20] away and you want ask them for how long
[3:36:23] are
[3:36:25] you for me I
[3:36:27] ask when they come I say what's your
[3:36:32] [Music]
[3:36:35] program I asked them what the
[3:36:44] program okay I get a picture but even
[3:36:47] then it sounds
[3:36:50] rude what I'm saying our
[3:36:59] generation but we make them
[3:37:10] hard they said they confirm
[3:37:12] 80 now you say they 80 people and then
[3:37:16] 200 people come on the
[3:37:19] day that is why when you're preparing
[3:37:21] you for 80
[3:37:24] people and they
[3:37:27] come that is why we have
[3:37:30] learned
[3:37:32] excess the other ones you give them
[3:37:38] excess those other ones who come you add
[3:37:41] Somey yeah you okay we expect 100 but if
[3:37:44] there is EXT we shall
[3:37:49] pay even the people who are cooking
[3:37:50] instead of cooking for 100 they cook for
[3:37:56] 120
[3:37:57] a on
[3:38:00] theost so if some of these weddings we
[3:38:03] can begin doing these
[3:38:05] things even if we have 20 people on the
[3:38:07] wedding no
[3:38:09] problem no problem the issue is the
[3:38:13] bride theom the
[3:38:17] parents the and a few
[3:38:21] friends and then the is finished don't
[3:38:25] complicate
[3:38:33] it I was we were we were going to see
[3:38:38] some wedding
[3:38:41] venue some younger
[3:38:43] people so they found there was a wedding
[3:38:47] already so they told him Pastor should
[3:38:49] we go and eat
[3:38:52] some what you mean you also
[3:38:57] fler I couldn't believe that even
[3:38:59] Believers fluk
[3:39:03] food I think that is a
[3:39:05] scene for sure anyways God bless you
[3:39:08] your
[3:39:13] old amen
[3:39:18] [Music]
