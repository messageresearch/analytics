that that i will not speak anything from my understanding but just the lord will come down and speak to your situation and speak to your heart let us open the book of exodus chapter 3 and then we're going to read from verses 1 to verses 15. it's a little bit longer reading but i want us to read together and follow through please never make a mistake of coming in the presence of god without the word amen the bible says that heaven and earth shall pass away but his word shall never that's the way yes the bible say that god told uh he told joshua that this word it should not depart from you you should meditate there in day and night amen and so that's it from i'm going to read as you fall through now moses kept the frog of jethro his father-in-law the priest of media and he led the flow to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god eventually and the anger of the lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed a mother said i'll now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not back and when the lord saw that that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the ministry of the bush and said moses moses and he turned say here i am and he said draw not tonight jesus put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where afar your step your standards is a holy ground amen moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob and mother seed his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their crime by the reason of their task monsters for i know they are sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians oh hallelujah let us repeat verse 7 again and the lord said i have surely sinned oh hallelujah the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have a heart oh and i've had their cry by the reason of their task master for i know they are sorrow and i am calm down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land amen and to bring them up out of that land and i'll underlij and do a land flowing with milk and then and to the place of the canaanites and the hebrews and the amorites and the parishes and the heavens and the gem sites now there are for behold the cry of the children of israel is common to me and i have also seen the operation where i read the egyptians for president come now therefore and i will send thee and to fell that thou may bring my people the children of israel amen we're going to stop there a little bit we shall go through let us also open the book of 2nd peter chapter 3 and verses nine second peter chapter three and verses nine amen hallelujah ii peter chapter three and verses nine if you're there say amen amen okay yes okay the bible says um verses nine the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some man counts luckiness but his long-suffering to us what not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance amen may the lord have blessed you in your reading of israel amen father we pray may you anoint this one this whole bible lord it is your word but father we believe tonight to pick us a portion of your will for this hour a portion of the food the daily man alone that he prepared before the foundation of the world may even know it lord that it may bring forth fruit in the mighty name of jesus christ you may be silly brothers and sisters wherever you are hallelujah we want to appreciate god for this wonderful time that he has given us to be in the presence of god hallelujah i believe the lord has kept you well i believe uh he has blessed you and and i want to tell you that though the situation you may look you may be looking around you may be singing opposite what the promise says that god is faithful amen amen he will make a word for you hallelujah we have just read from the book of exodus amen my sermon today is entitled god has not delayed and god has not denied but what are you doing amen god has not denied that's why and god has not denied but brother sam what are you doing amen you know as children of god there are very many times we we we live this journey of life and that and many times we we think that god has blamed to do what he promised to do god has delayed to do to answer our prayers and uh and uh and usually when we see brother shame please help me do me a favor yes you understand and uh and usually when we think that god has delayed it takes us to a moment where we think that god has denied amen we think that god has denied now the sermon is god has not delayed god has not denied but my brother my sister church of god the bride of christ what are you doing right if you think he has the name what are you doing about it these things he has denied what are you doing about it we have just read from them from one of the most important verses in the in the life of israel the journey when god was taking his children from a from from from a land of bondage god was taking his children from a land where he took them himself guru was was talking to people that he had promises that he had made himself oh let me tell you none of the children of israel who were in bondage was let me let me bring it this way no one of the people who were in egypt had anything to do with what white they were there oh let me rephrase it right so that you may get it we believe there was more than two million people but none of them was was even aware or concerned or most of them did not even it was not because of them that they were in the land of captivity it was not their own making it was not this was god is making these men just found themselves in prison these men just found themselves starving past masters they found themselves in the world they didn't ask themselves to be there if it is not the truth are we not exactly the same type we just found ourselves here we found our mothers we just woke up one day and we started seeing daddy and we just started seeing mommy and we just found ourselves in this world we didn't know where we came from we didn't know what what we are doing here but that doesn't mean that whatsoever we were bumped into whatsoever we were caught into it was started by somebody the bible says in the book of philippians chapter 1 and verses 6 when you shall not read that it says that he who began a good work in us that's right he is faithful that he will bring you to accomplishment but now this is where the question comes do you know that the mess you are in the egypt you are in the life you're in somebody had to start that journey do you even know it we are looking at the people who fold themselves in this kind of life but i want to thank god and minister what these people were going through god because it was his plan because it was his will because it was his promise he had prepared a messenger amen he had prepared somebody to come to the sea and let these people know what is going on amen that's right that's right he had prepared a messenger who was to come with a message to let these people know what is going on yes why all the hard work why would the heartache why are they the weeps and i want to tell you my brother my sister this is evil right we are also coaching this mess the lord prepared a messenger and a message for you for this hour amen amen my brother my sister we have a messenger that was ordained specifically to pick a people out of islam to another man he was ordained before the foundation of the world he was purposed and his work was nothing but it would go and pick these people yes from the land where they didn't know about how they went amen that is why my brother my sister was listening to me as long as you don't realize who began a work in you as long as you don't realize the plan he has for you you will always say that he has delayed that's right you will not only say that he has denied yes one day we were praying somewhere and then somebody was asking god that has not answered me and then he was did he give you a timetable did you give me a debt and the time and the hour the week when he will answer have you waited enough like ibrahim have you written enough like moses how many years 40 years why are you saying goodness delayed why are you saying good as me we have a messenger in this hour we have a message my brother and the root and the way and the journey it is all within this ordained messenger that is why my brother my sister you must know your messenger and you must know his message all right that's right probably in egypt those men they were there some of them when moses had come they remembering their feelings as long as they didn't know that the messenger has come they remain crying let me tell you something about know me the bible talks about a man called jacob this jacob had a son he loved so much that the son was called joseph and then very many things happened as you know and he thought his son was dead do you know how many years jacob spent crying weeping in agony for a son a beloved that he thought was dead but let me ask you was the son dead now what was the agony about my sister what is the tears about joseph was not dead i don't know i didn't get time to cultivate how many years did it take but the bible says this man loved him here the bible says those who know their god i want that word in you do you know what heaven is doing in this hour we are in a time which is a very very important time as a ministry and as the bride of christ here as a ministry we are in a time where we are believing we are stepping into the water to start the construction of days of the voice cabana is it true but let me tell you something as we are planning to construct a physical building let me tell you the secret god is also planning actually he's not planning he already started planning to build a spiritual building as we are going together to do this to construct god also wants to construct us by the time this message came to the israelites time was no more we are into building but even god is into building us god is into building our lives god is into building our i don't know whatsoever portion of your life brother give me that message study exodus i believe all of you children of god you know that the moment where we are now we are in what we call the third episode we are in the third exodus i'm saying that the word exodus means cold out we have people who are here to come from somewhere and go somewhere we are not established people we are not just a people we are not pastors we are not just another church you are not just another christian you are not just another brother you are not just another woman no yes we are people of god that have been called from somewhere into some way zombie has confidence in you but what are you doing yes what are you doing about it right right what are you doing about the hours right now what are you doing about the word of the hour what are you doing about the prophecy of the hour what are you doing about the journey that we started when we came to this message what are you doing i'm just grumbling are you guessing my money have you got it my brother the the third exercise uh 6306 30. we're going to read from paragraph 62 and down through amen my brother this is coming yeah it is uh select the last 63 0 6 30 paragraph 62 yeah then we shall go down up to paragraph 68 oh no i didn't i just i just wrote the title here then maybe you can look for the word green amen the third exodus amen thank you very much okay yes paragraph let's go to 62. let's follow closely and see what the prophet was saying before yes before yes please excuse us a little bit before we can find out what this exodus mean and i am going to type the exodus now to exodus then okay so he was talking about the eggs that we are in now and he's going to type into the exodus then now and watch if it isn't run exactly parallel so we're saying we are going to type our exodus today and the other one and see whether things are not running parallel one of them is natural and the very same things that he did in the nature he's typing it again and typing it in now this one is said that what happened in the natural exodus when god was physically taking his children out of this land of captivity out of this land of bondage a landlord crime a land of groaning a land of confusion brothers and sisters is it not the type of this exodus we are in right that's right we're now in a land of questions a land of hard work the land meaning it is getting fulfilled now exactly exactly as it was that is why church of god we need to know what exactly is going on so that we don't just chase the wind now motherless to see the word of god how anyone could say it's not his fire this was about 2800 years ago you know and now that he promised and what he's done and laid it out there for example how he makes the shadow of something to testify of the positive so still giving the time i get to uh i get to that tonight between the moon and the sun the lord willing amen but let's go to this part but first we must review genesis to see why they were down in egypt now let's give it some time i love this part he said and i was introducing i said these people found themselves in a place they didn't know about how they came we are still reading that quote they didn't know but not brother branham he wants to take us back my brother my sister do you know that where you are there was a time you made a choice to be there knowingly or knowing whether it was you or you just fooled yourself do you know it and that's right you see many times as we are writing this many times this in this world we ask ourselves this question why why why you know why people ask themselves that question why it is because down deep inside their hearts something tells them you're not supposed to be here something just brought you here the one preacher said why not but the reason as to why there is always that question in our hearts why why it is because by the time you say why you're not supposed to be there amen i'll go to genesis they were down in need why would goddess people be out of that land why why are goddess people out of that land after all god promised that right there where the beginning was with abraham isaac and jacob in the palestine god gave them that land god had given his people their land god had blessed his people good as continuing people why are we crying here at night why are these things happening to us why are we not in canon felons why are we living below our privileges as children of god why have we reached to a moment where we think god has delayed that yesterday why then after asking you why my question to this from the lord is what are you doing about it god gave them that land this is it oh that why would the people not be in the place that god provided them now let me ask you children of god please leave it are you sure you're aware where god wants you somebody answered me are you really sure convinced in your heart that right now you are where god wants you to be all right now if you're there do you know what is going on now these people they didn't know but probably when mothers came and told them then they got the awareness now we have got the awareness by the believing of this message of the hour but now what are we doing about it those days we didn't know why we are here we were just enjoying our lives we're just living the way we want but ever since we received the message ever since we got the call yes that please you know the good thing i love about this message and about this exodus it was it was more concerned about god of course these children of israel had a law to pray but the biggest rule was already played let me remind you first when jesus died at calvary what did he say he said he is finished amen that's right let me tell you bragg of christ we are just fighting in what we call a cold war a battle that was already finished amen the moment the prophet moses came in the land what these people have to do is to listen to the messenger amen to listen to the message to remain every promise amen claim the promises that's right by the time the prophet comes everywhere what was the children of israel doing what were they doing do you know what heaven is doing do you not a spiritual stand do you know the spiritual campus do you know what heaven is doing now that is why you see the message is not a bunch of rules and regulations those are those it is beyond that my sister yes she said look at this message is beyond putting on the wrong dress it is beyond [Music] that's the question of today also god gave us pentecost i'm not talking about this for denomination god gave us what pentecost he gives us the book of acts amen now let me tell you do you know what the book of acts means okay let us just get the word acts faster the other day was telling us about something that there was a preacher was talking to him and said that me i am a man who gives action let me tell you this message this god this messenger this journey this exodus it is a journey of acts it is a journey of actions that's right amen the president was talking about the true identification of the great church there must be action right brother shame there must be actions there must be acts of the holy spirit in your life amen amen right amen he gave us the book of hearts he gave us the holy spirit to lead us and guide us he give us a land a brother my sister do you believe that there is a land that he gave us do you believe and why are we out of it i am praying with all my heart that the lord may speak to you as we are sharing this why are you out of it why are we not out of pentecost why are we out of the book of acts why why isn't the great christian church today living again like the book of acts yes we have heard messages we are preachers i'm saying that the rapture is over new time is first spent okay if we think god has delayed and some other people even some time ago they gave up buying that if you think god has been ready to come and take his church if you think god has led to take you into the land where you belong what are you doing about it sister what are you doing about it what are you doing about the promise of this hour what are you doing about the pentecost bringing forth the same thing there is some reason for it amen children of god that is what we are here for we are not just here to pass time amen the other time says that when the night of passover came when the passover night came everybody was told to do what to get their names to eat they pass over meat brother says he was dramatizing it and he said that the children were wondering that he was eating the meat while peeping in the window with the stuff hey why the time had come everything you are doing my sister my brother just know that time is here god is just waiting he's just waiting for the blind basically the prophet said that the wedding garment and all its materials are already finished but the problem is some of us are still very huge that we cannot fit in there yet let me tell you that is why i love this message the message tells the symbols using what you are saying to me you should never promise to marry because children when you are not ready because once the pride is [Music] it is a clear sign that you have not yet put on the garment yet the reason as to why jesus has not yet come back yet it is a clear sign that some of us have yes before i married there was a young man who told me you will want to marry them tomorrow the bridegroom is there waiting he just wants us to get married yes as you're working as you planning as you're thinking whatever you're doing let me tell you i think we are the only brand who will be allowed to be doing some business while we are putting on that elf see because we are still waiting for mother we are waiting for somebody to come my brother put on your gum the exorcist is at home go to school with your girl go to them and to the garage with your girl this is no time for no sense that's right amen amen there is a reason my brother get me isaiah 50 verse 1 and 2. tell your neighbour there is a reason why you are where you are that's right my family my family at home there is the reason why we are aware we are brother kevin i'm telling you just there is a reason why you are where you are amen amen there is no i.t man or any manufacturer who first manufactures a speaker that's that speaker he manufactures it and then he asks what do i need for okay now what is the use of these things that are i cannot see that kind of manufacturer who is a manufacturer and again called the friends you brothers what can we use this guitar for that is what you were not good at they are asking very silly very useless characters god you are there was so who has told you that he manufactured that editor who has said that he put that seed in that dark fruit and he didn't know that he could have too bad there is a reason why you are where you are isaiah 50 verse 1 as i said the lord where is the bill of your mother's depression he was asking these people were complaining where is the bill of your mother's divorcement when did i divorce your mother who have i put away so good question we have encountered very many questions in the bible where god was asking such kind of questions in the beginning part of isaiah chapter one he was saying that i gave birth and i nursed but my children don't know so he was asking when did i chase him you are saying that i have delayed when where where when like where when did the guy who told you he said that he has denied to answer who has told you he was asking them can you imagine god was asking this question amen i think you've got to know behind this scene but i believe these children were when these these people were where like they were today m behold for your iniquities have you sold yourselves and for your transgression is your mother put away now here i said there is a reason why you are welcome let me tell you god has wanted and god has not met but what are you doing let me tell you children of god whether you know it or you don't know it you are doing something [Music] you have refused we have decided to be single you are doing something yes but if you say god is great if you're saying things are not changed your sins god is not yes you said where is the god of elijah let me tell you he is asking us have anybody watched you however put you away i've never told you if something is not happening we are doing something oh we are not doing something you are right amen why don't you print another scripture there it is still in isaiah 59 1 what are you doing it is a time to go it is a time of preparation it is a time to make ourselves ready what are you doing before you say god has great what are you doing before you say what has not answered from the scriptures we read let us face so the point it means this people's soul to god his hand was and then he said you people look here my heart is not shortened that god is no longer blessing his truth to change you something is there you ain't not doing it or you're not doing it you're saying his hand is sure in the scriptures there are these people that is why he's coming tonight very sad the never said that enoch worked with god and he was have we yet worked with god to that extent because when we work with him i tell you we shall be known but your iniquities are separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his face from him that he will not hear praise now what are you doing why are we reading the book of isaiah let me tell you in the next one let me tell you man he always had a has a part to play in goddess redemption work let me repeat it man a human being always has a part to play in goddess redemption plan we as the bride of christ we as the days of the voicing of god you as wherever you're watching from you have a path to play in what you think is the way in what you think has been connected to you you have a part play you're either playing the wrong path which is hindering you or you must play the right path which is going to take you to wherever you know how many messages i know i don't want to ask these kind of questions because they sometimes they look as if you're judging people how many times do you do you are you in the message man has a bad too please i don't know my brother with a good canal person we go back to our messaging exercise hallelujah my brothers my sister goddess goddess denied god has not done this you are no longer praying you are complaining you are no longer praying you are explaining [Music] whether you know what you're doing or you don't know what you're doing you are doing something brother son you are doing something the bible says that the children of israel they cried when god came to moses when he was in media he came to him with a report i think in heaven there is a there is a there is an angel who deals with people's prayers now before you complain before you ask those questions what do you think is your paper is it empty is it having complaints is it having what could come to moses right now moses according to the report uh due to these 400 years which passed this is what i've found out from my children why the bible says what they were crying they are groaning they are calling upon their god there is somewhere where the daniel said that i understood through the prophet jeremiah writings they were crying that is the report god brought to his prophet they were pruning and then he said now i have her now brother what are you doing let me tell you dismantle of elijah we are holding it is not a joke it is not a childish plan it is not the story of long ago it is a serious business it is a non-process business look at what the message has become today today there are even divorces in messages today people are still getting married and they they separating them things which cannot even be talked about they're happening today and really wondering at least they repeat the real people who are boring we used to call them the goals are you sure are you sure we are going when we are just divorcing when we are just crying [Music] let me tell you brother paul said that you have not fought to the spirit of your blood that's right we have not the children of israel had to listen yes how did you listen to the message how did you believe the messenger brother please give us that quote and we finish yeah yes we all know that we are broke up yeah please i don't notice he's saying something in 1963 which is exactly for us tonight we all know that we are broken he said in 1963 isn't the world broke up now and we are only in terrible 1967 and in the most terrible condition that that christianity has ever lived in is today brother brother may god bless you he's saying the most terrible condition christianity has ever lived is today do you know what it means for people to sit at home and they don't come to church foreign look what is going on in the christian world brother branhammer said terrible has ever lived is today it is the time and we are on the right on the brim or the blink of a breath now why are we in a very terrible condition it is because this wide brimmer bring to the i was preaching to my family at home in the altar i told them to really carry anywhere we at the age any time that's right the plane takes off from the ground at the speed of which is the fastest on the ground and when it is in anything it knocks it down so the time of swapping up the time it is a very time it is a time of nonsense time amen amen there is no more joke you can't just come to church you know it is not a time for people to be reminded to come to church that's right for people to come to church it is not the time to remind people to fast and pray it is not that time brothers it is time to gather amen we are the brim of the bridge at the edge of a great terrific judgment playing for the church yoga there is a fire that is going to fall on this earth and you cannot even tell somebody passing by that judgment is coming brother repent and you're complaining that you don't have man what is money and before this judgment can happen god is calling an extraorder just like he did then come here though they went down in egypt all because of the jerusalem brother that's the reason that israel went in egypt there is a reason why you know where you are that is the reason why i don't pray my sister there is a reason why you're complaining and god has sent me to tell you that it is not from his side it is yes god let me tell you this when we are traveling let me tell you some of the things i am thinking about when we are traveling to to take when i'm printing those books and we are traveling to to go to these streets to see people who are going to translate in my heart i have very many questions and i am saying do these people know what god has done to make sure that they must do they even know do you know how many millions in that room to make sure my brother you get this book which you only give to your children to pray till now we drive miles and miles and my god there me i mean he noticed in my heart in my number these people really know they understand what god has interested in us my brother before you complain before do you know that's the reason the reason i was in egypt you are there because some things i rather than i want you to understand we are typing the spiritual we are typing the physical we are typing what is going on in your life so i want you to decide what is going on these people were there because of everything remember god's promises was only as long as they stayed in that land there was a promise for the people were born there is a promise for the people 100 message now are you pursuing that promise or you are pursuing advice now can you see what we are speaking in prayer a few moments why did god have to have a pharaoh's heart to put the people to put the people back in the promised land before he could bless them to bring forth the messiah to them let us read this together why did god have to have them rushing into the camera why is it that sometimes things become hard why do you think the world now has reached where it is you know look go the heart in the pharaoh we are let me tell you it is not any president of this world that we are at home yeah no sir it is not any man he had any fellows at heart to put the people back in the promised land before he could bless them to bring forth the messiah today you want to be blessed in a foreign land no you must first get out of it we have a promise we have a promise it is for when he shall appear we shall be like he wants to be like him while you're still in egypt it is impossible that's right in egypt right so they wanted to push them out of this land so that they will go to a place where he will have to bless them from amen he wanted to push let me tell you for that episode has to take place there was a rio pentecost whatever prayer yeah do you name a man called elijah one day he closed heaven brother one day closed heaven but let me tell you a time when it came to open it again the bible says he put his head in the knife yes in order to bring first the rain he had to put his hand then you hear the message believer saying that song in the service oh larry let me tell you we are not a regular zoo we are not here to to give a special song then just come to the public to preach 51 52 they had the two cry out you have to cry out that is the report

this is not a place for games united to know there is a are going to marry and service their wedding this is not playing time the bible says they cried out for help this is the time days of the voice to go on our knees bread of christ this is the time to cry like we have never cried before [Music] they are tears of calvary they are tears of redemption only just being there doing things for the sake right you are not a message builder for the sake god can turn from these stones children to ibraheem don't you know it do you think you're very special you find some people say then you fall and i tell you if you are jonah they will pick you from a frog from a fish's leg stop trying to cry [Music] when the women are producing children because a time of giving birth is another time of this is the time we are supposed to back brother listen it let me read it here and moses was the prophet and now he has to prophesy that he was going to bring israel up he didn't say how he was going to do it but he was going to bring them out of egypt come and ask me brother branham was given this message to all to call out a rebecca for isaac to call a bride for isaac but did i tell him how he's going to do it he just came on the scene and preached that priesthood preached when moses brought this message to the children of israel he didn't know how these things are going to happen but he was going to bring them out if god had said it he had said it and they were going to come out my brother if the prophet of this hour and the word of god promise that there is going to be a church that is going to be raptured in this hour that church is going to be there amen hallelujah whether you're part of it or you're not part of it whenever you were in the boat or you're not in your boat the flats are going to come amen the voice of the sun paragraph 54 51 yes okay uh yes yes please try to drop it a little bit see what is going to do [Music] okay oh yes didn't say i was going to do it but he was going to bring them out of egypt we must get out of this agent my sister you must get out of that egypt it is a must that is the anointing that is on the prophet of this hour we must get what we must have there is no enough devils there is no witches there is no preparations in this area they are not there if there is a bride in this area of god there is nothing to this earth [Music] yes that's the way he does it at the beginning that's the way he does it now he ever does it the same way see the world comes to that prophet we believe in the prophet and moses was the prophet and now he has to prophesy that he was going to bring israel up didn't say how he was going to do it but he was going to bring them up please don't bring put it over my sister even i don't know how god is going to bless you i don't know how god is going to feel you i don't know what is going to use it but as long as he said he is going to do amen all right he's going to do it amen god it has never tell let me tell you god gives the promise but he doesn't give the process he has christ he had had their cries brother what are you doing that is my question shell what are you doing sister stella what are you doing the bible says he had had their crime are you crying enough and they are groans are you groaning enough brother that is where the sun exodus people were that is where you are with them crying enough groaning enough and their prayers when i told you that there were parties there what do you think the tears were about their tears were not about building new houses in egypt their tears are not about their colonized situation in egypt the tears were about the time which has come for them to go out from there [Applause] with jesus god was waiting but he was only waiting for the people to call him into action [Music] yo we need to call that god into action amen i believe he has got the same thing today waiting for his church to call him for the sally pool you have not called him enough the promise of today is ready i just enjoy this meet the promise of today is ready but he has got to get the people to pray and groaning like they were down there but see god has not delayed and has not denied amen but what are you doing that we are praying they are groaning they are calling upon you to come on the sea if we can only do that the god of elijah will come to this land welcome to this number will come in your family that promise is here amen amen you don't need another prophet brother i'm saying that if anybody will ever tell you that there is another this is our moses now we must be here amen amen good pleasure are we together he was waiting for them to cry they cried brother mother the youth in this church the bride of christ that is listening to me my sister my friend my family my wife and everybody that is listening to me everywhere i thought it is a time to go and put the head between the legs like elijah and call upon the girl peter is saying it's not slack past luckiness may be true exodus chapter 3 verse 19 that i am summarizing brother bring it very quickly 3 19 the bible says god said that he will harden the fellow's heart and then he said it will take god's mighty hand to run out of bondage he said it will take and i am sure listen to what god was saying to moses and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go i am sure [Music] i am will not let you go no come to undyal god was testifying then he said not by a mighty hand meaning he will only let you go by almighty amen that is the word brethren that is the word of the lord if that physical exodus types this spiritual exodus we will only leave this earth we will only overcome this earth yes by almighty amen this world one of these days must witness the mighty hand of jehovah amen amen this world one of these days must witness the god of life this fellow one of these deaths must feel the anger of oh my god of the god of the children of israel amen amen wait for now but i'm telling you there are things sometimes they have to fight the bible says after jacob had blessed none after isaac had blessed jacob jacob instead of essa do you have something for me say no i don't have it i don't have my son but then he said that if you will fight if you will work ahead you will break off that yacht of your breath from the days of john the baptist the kingdom of god suffers fire do we have another john the baptist in our age we have another spirit of elijah at this age yes the kingdom of god is suffered by and the violence must take it by science is running so very quickly there's a book i remember oh god bringing to my remembrance well the problem was i think it was countdown he was talking about that as science goes higher the same weight that's in the spirit as science is advancing even the blind of christ in the spiritual things must be advanced right we shall take this land which is full of jebusites my brother blessed me last week which is full of jebusites anakin's humans but wait a minute with the groans with crime we need prayer like never as i summarized it was easy for elijah to close heaven but he had to to even put his head between his knees my brother my sister are you sure i have called out loud are you sure i am called out loud there are very many things that are making but maya has to shut down but he said no sir that is my deliveries that is my rapture that is my holy ghost that is my promised land he continued shouting the woman with an issue of blood had to be bold enough to press through the crowds do you know that woman in nature bruh those days those people were not allowed to come in the public but he said no sir obama hannah had to pray like never before zacchaeus had to climb alex community to see jesus jesus was passing jesus this man realized at this age jesus was prophesying his person he said i must do what other people have not done oh hmm picture happy to repent now as i am reading this i want you to find yourself and i'm also finding myself brother peter had to prepare me daniel knew by books of prophet the number of days the disciples had to wake him up when they were on the trouble they had to wake him up as long as let me read this as i finish as long as they were obedient please listen to this my brothers my sister it is in the message don't bring it it is in the message you can really let her where i think pentecostal failed i must as long as they were obedient as long as they wasn't grumbling and fasting as long as they were obedient and walked humbly before god god went before them and led them by the hand and packed them on the ego's wings but the minute they got out of order god separated himself from them that's right well the journey my sister i'm talking about your journey now the journey was only about 40 miles they could make it in a couple of three days and they were 40 years wandering around out there trying to get ready to go the journey of the rapture the journey of the children of israel getting out of the land of bullet the prophet jesus said it was like 40 miles or something but it took them 40 years my brother my sister as we are winding up as we are studying i don't know how many years the journey is taking for you and it is very possible to take a very long agenda if the physical exodus types the spiritual if people wonder it means even now people might be wondering time is faster brother my sister time is faster was not supposed to be 40 years in the wilderness it was a very short journey but the grammar the cry he has delayed he has none no no the one this [Music] god has given us his promises like he did to israel very mighty promises but you can be moving a journey of 40 days for 40 years what are you doing my brother what are you doing are you just loitering let me let me invite her first the lord bless amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] listen to god [Music] is [Music] you shall receive the holy ghost one more time we sent [Music] [Applause] times [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] see the brother read that scripture in exodus 3 19 and he says i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go and indeed this is true you know one thing i love about the message is that it's a message of types and how he types the the physical things with the spiritual the old testament with the new things that were happening there big shadows of what was happening in the end the end is now our time now so he says i am sure that the king of eden do not let you go no not by a mighty hand that was a very strong one and the preachers told us even today it is the same thing the king of egypt will not let you go no but by almighty what was the mighty heart at that time it was a ministry of a vindicated messenger it was a ministry of a man of god that is sent over down there to egypt and you remember as the preacher was saying when moses stood there oh yes hallelujah it was time for them to move the devil could not do them any longer why because god had vindicated moses god had sent moses the mighty hand of god was moses his ministry and those people after they had received the mothers that we had god had no delay god had not denied their deliverance but what were they doing they had received moses yes but what happened many of them rejected moses sure many of them and we know that there were two over two million but about around 72 million and almost all of them died in the desert and it was another generation that went in the promised land our place is supposed to be the promised land but many have died in the desert of doubt many have died in the desert before they receive the holy ghost of you know self-pity desert of peace they're not a problem you know the bible says the word of god is a designer of the truth i believe that the word of god is designing us you see he knows where each of us are even where no one knows he knows what you're thinking what your party what and what what is confusing you but the other god is designing you right and he's telling you look they died because of that desert because they died because of that they died because you know they they were not doing something right you know when the holy spirit moves when god is moving you need to be found in the right place just doing the right thing amen i kind of feel that the holy spirit is pushing us even in the services before but the man has been preaching brother brother joe also preached i've been also preaching and the holy spirit is pushing us to something in order to enter into a certain atmosphere for certain things to begin to happen why are we at this place are we at this place by by accident i want each of you to think those who are online sister winnie i saw your family there brother martin sister wanga sister rose i saw you there as well the different ones whoever you are those of you who are here but okay father-son why are we in this place now why are we here now god is bringing us into this place so that he can accomplish his will in our life but look we need to understand the place we are in and the time we are in of course we had that the man the father of joseph jacob was crying he was weeping all that time because of his son he did not know that actually his son was fulfilling his destiny which would be their destiny amen there is no place you are going to go to even if it is egypt if god wants you to be at such a place which is of course indeed in this case i want to mean suffering problem doubt worry kobe 19 no school you are out of school two years don't know what the future is going to be like or your plans look as if they're shattered you know you are you're in a press play you never plan to be right now you don't know even what your job is going to be you know you know god has brought you into such a place so that you can fulfill your destiny there is no reason for you to doubt god amen like jacob the only thing he had to do was to enter into the anointing to enter the right atmosphere to understand the season and the time he was living in at that time so that he can be able to glorify god even without knowing what god is doing [Applause] now where does all of the glorified god god still did his do you know power it feels like when god is doing something for you and you don't know and your benefits are complaining do you know what it feels like do you know how the holy spirit feels when is planning something for you when he wants to do something for you and you are they are grumbling doubting we are very what's that you know you know we we are not satisfied jacob now all day i'm sure he might have gone to wedding with his videos if he's alive after all i'm sure he might have gotten to himself and say why did they worry i wasn't all my ears and i wasn't all my timing you know in crying and tears in sadness instead of joy i would not even have been we too have received god's right hand to us in our generation hallelujah [Music] [Music] go back and listen to it maybe you missed out a few things yeah and i i don't know if you read this but somehow i i came across as you were preaching and look brother says in a prophet like aunty moses what if you would find your you are convenient today and you wouldn't be there he's here now why not this be your convenient time you know something was aware the preacher has really preached well you know sometimes the word comes where i will find a convenient time and really seek him more get into deep you know you know then he said sometimes you can't say well yeah let us see for now let me see you like this but when i get a convenient time i will really watch with all my art when i'm in the church and everybody's there then i really do it i'm now home i'm on the screen i'm listening only now i'm just watching but when i'm there yeah it will be a community time for me to worship it is your time now is it here now yes why not this be your community times now this is the hour of salvation this is the time to receive here this is the time to be free to the holocaust oh yes why the holocaust is here present in fiber proof of his word that he lives and because he lives he wants you to live also men and women who are standing here now as predator jesus said he that comes to me i will know why his caster and he said no man can come to me except my father draws you fast we should stop pushing these things for the future yes if god moved in the past he's moving now amen if god is going to move in the future let me not wait for the future me see him in my school let me see live in my life let me see live in my place let me see him in my worries let me we're at a place where you enter our atmosphere there is something about atmosphere when you enter that kind of atmosphere you get to a place where you no longer want it you know when you enter the right atmosphere what do you do you worship the world when you know the right atmosphere what do you do you pray when you read that atmosphere what do you do you rejoice you glorify god you enter into his presence and that things begin to happen even for this that is before us this mountain which seems to be very difficult for us of course each of you individuals have your different small small mountains but i'm talking about here now the mountain that is before us to to do the fundraising for the church for construction this is small before the lord oh yes hallelujah god has got the way to do it for us but i don't deny this what are we doing about it what are we doing when you when you vowed it was a vow when you played to give something some upgrade even give it but when you pledge to give when you vow to give did you just think that it will not happen i want you to have faith what are you doing have faith what are you doing exercising believe it hallelujah look out for it prepare yourself move from where you are in your area of doubt and come to where you are you should be in the place where you should be faith in the finished work of the cross hallelujah praise the name of the lord there are many things that i would comment but our time is fast spent i want to say god bless you let us just uh watch the world a little bit and then we shall close god bless as we we will pray for father henry ford well
