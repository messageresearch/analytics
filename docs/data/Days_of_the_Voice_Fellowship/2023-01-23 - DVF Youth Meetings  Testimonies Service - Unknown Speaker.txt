children missed that you must would say these days because this this name to all the conventions make sure that I saved my youths make sure that they attained all the conversations for them maybe they don't know [Applause] thank God so much [Applause] and in all those meetings I've attended never attended them transport ation I saw young people down here we've never seen I want to thank God so much [Applause] one more thing I've forgotten in the morning my husband wanted me to go to our church service I told him in the morning the preacher told us yesterday so I told him I have to watch I finish it so foreign to display I want to thank God so much I've been receiving and feeling in every meeting I finished it [Applause] amen Glory Glory I believe you young men that are not yet married when I see the sister as young as she is and she still has such testimonies I cannot say as old you know but I'm saying as young as she is where is our daughters can you stand up actually can you come here I had your heart you have testimonies all of you come here yes and and she has such a testimony yeah I know with Jesus of having more and more experience even after having children this site [Applause] the boys who are the boys come on come on all right all right [Applause] oh my God now I think my wife will be your friend's sister Jesse because I say you to have something in common now I need you so what I was saying to you young man all right come on in after the fun this side system yeah those ones who are streaming they want to see you also [Applause] so what I was saying you young men who want to marry you should matter sisters that have received an experience why do you want to marry a girl because she's beautiful someone who has received the Holy Spirit [Music] praise the name of the Lord foreign the Holy Spirit anybody can receive the Holy Spirit if they saw desires haven't we seen God doing it in these meetings so some Believers think when you believe you have received the Holy Spirit that is an experience women or sisters that have not received the holy spirit yet they are spiritual before you marry them they are spiritual before you marry them that one ends they become something else become a monster in the house without the holy spirit so friends let us ensure to have the Holy Spirit so we have our Mama's here sister just say and the other sisters a good example let us emulate them now those ones who are testimonies can stay the others can go back okay the ones who have the testimony foreign I thank God while we were praying yeah [Music] Jesus but she pressed Stone to Jesus himself told him it is not good for me to give the food of the children to that doctor the situations that I have to leave when I when I've received my childhood um those conventions I want to receive the baptism of the Holy now again and I prayed in that Wednesday fellowships that is Jesus keeping his appointments and there she was forgiven her sins my prayer answered I give Gloria an honor back to his name [Applause] is now before the sister speaks let me ask how many here don't understand English anybody okay so we will just use English then God bless you enjoy I want to talk about that I didn't want to come for this meeting precisely because last year in December I attended so many youth meetings and I reached a poet and said now so the sisters of mine kept on calling me on Friday where are you where are you where are you wearing it's like what's up brother I was like I don't want to pack things they told me that you just come just we shall share that books after the size industry as you can see but I want to thank God I've got a fulfillment and there's something that was bothering me so much and I thank God that it was preached by Brother Isaac so actually I gave them that testimony so I want to thank God for that [Applause] it was preached it was bothering you what happened what did the Lord do has the Lord did something about oh yes the Lord has done something I think it was yesterday I I went to Pasta Lima and I told him that I'm having a kind of depression and I think but the reason that's why I've not come to you again it's because I don't have it again Hallelujah [Applause] praise God my name is Sister Miriam chirago I want to thank God for the experience I got it was I had a torment as something like a wall like when you pray you don't feel it okay you don't feel the Breakthrough so I had it before I came for these meetings and I told God I want to get a touch at least the church from you in these meetings so this thing I got it from when I was there's a there's a time which was on Sandy we went to speckled bed Church so the brother called one altar call was for those people who want to get sick so some people came that wanted to to restore their lives as in the backsliders maybe to be prayed for and maybe it was a spirit that told me go there and I refused from that time I felt a block like when I used to pray even when people are getting filled I was not getting a breakthrough so on Saturday when pastor called for the altar call he also said the same words rather give you and say he said that those people want to get saved and the devil came back to me telling don't go yeah those people want to get surgery he said the backsliders and we really mean the backsliders the people who have left us a message started wearing trousers and started cutting their hair and all that so I the devil kept on telling me don't go like you told me last time and I was even scared come in front so I looked and I looked no one was coming he said bow your heads and no one was coming in front but I see if today I'm finishing it so I said I moved in France it was not really easy I took a step and moved in front I said I want like whether it's like so like Jacob he was he wanted he wanted to get that blessing from the Lord he said no matter what comes I must be blessed so I left and came to say and I thank God that she really touched [Applause] before the sister speaks I I want to say that this sister has given a testimony let it impact also your life if God speaks I think you've had ministers saying I say it a lot especially when we're in a time of prayer that whatever he tells you to do you see so she was in a service God spoke to her and she disobeyed and when she disobeyed the devil then came and began to torment her so when you disobey the Holy Spirit the devil will get a room to come in your life it's always good to obey the voice of the Holy Spirit whatever he tells you you might be in a service and it tells you lift up your hands and Shout just as simple as that and you don't and then the Devil comes and commence you so but God is a god of second brother Michael second third fourth fifth sixth seventh chances God is a god of chances and he has given us this another chance and she received devastation we want to praise be to God amen [Applause] praise God my name is Sister patience I I want to thank God for these meetings specifically because last year there are so many things we we attended as they always speaking but there is something they did to me the anointing let me see held me throughout there so this time around I said I must not meet and if I get a chance to attend I must make it minute so I pray to God today in the morning we had morning devotion I prayed but I wasn't feeling a breakthrough but just as brother Michael was preaching and the power went off somehow something told me that's new down there and prayed and I don't know that I was just carried away I thank God for filling me the Holy Ghost again God bless you amen Hallelujah you know by the way nothing goes wrong when we are in the right place you see you know the the power was not supposed to go off we thought that maybe power it was Lord shedding it wasn't you see there was a scenario there the way it got finished in I don't have time to explain it but it was just God wanted it to be that way let me just leave it at that but power went off in the middle of a service but you see it went off at the exactly right moment when the Holy Spirit wanted to come and baptize people at that moment brother brother Michael would have continued so the Holy Spirit had to restrain him by force stop and at that moment the Holy Spirit took over and you can hear such a testimony the devil thought that he was giving us a blow but actually it was God doing his work just like when Jesus Christ went on the cross the devil was happy he was like oh man I'm done with him I'm finishing up with him but he did not know that God was just beginning actually God was climaxing his work for us that's exactly what happened here and we want to thank God for it and for the service that evening praise the name of the Lord amen do you thank God for those testimonies very powerful testimonies [Applause] I have some papers here from the same name so I do not know whether it is the same sister Faith who is this the faith did you write two cheats two papers so probably there is another sister Faith so I'll begin with this I don't know whether you are the one God bless you since I I thank God for the gift of life I have a short testimony is that you no who is this the faith are you still here she's not okay okay then you can come if you're the one I've not read this so but I think you have a testimony you can just come over [Applause] God bless these things I want to thank God for attending this meeting I heard about this meeting from seta convention last year I was yelling and praying to attend on Thursday last week I knew the meeting is starting on Friday I had a lot of morale in me I was telling a certain brother that I don't want to miss the pillar of fire that is going to fall on the Saints I wanted to start with me now on Thursday at night last Thursday I slept I had a dream a certain gentleman was showing me something which was blocking me not to attend this meeting immediately I woke up when I woke up I prayed I said God I have to attend this meeting no matter what to take so on Friday we came we came actually when they were almost starting by preaching and brother Michael preached that we should cut off the way and run it heated my heart I felt touched I felt delivered I felt so happy I felt that burden was in me was all carried immediately so when we were going back to the dormitories I think the devil was annoyed with me saying let me tell you I fell down in that friend I don't know how it happened I got injured my knees were all paining I had pain but I rejoiced I said this is a sign of victory I I talked to a certain brother they gave me first aid so I continued with everything this thing has delivered me I had hatred in my heart for two years I used to pray God how can I forgive these people but it was so hard for me to forgive them because I knew they know the truth they are believers what they have done to me was so painful the moment I think of forgiveness I feel like it is impossible so I thought I'm okay I'm fine glory be to God amen amen Hallelujah God is a heart doctor he just operated that sister you have a brand new heart hatred is no longer in our heart if you're not going to be happy about these things what are you going to be happy about Hallelujah God bless this is a sister Mary peace Tabernacle she says God bless you Saints I just want to take this opportunity to thank the almighty God for the grace that he has given me through these meetings especially in the morning service I think it was written today did you receive this today yes um in the morning service that is I think the Morning Glory or the morning I do not know um really got touched on me in the in a different way and I appreciate him so much for that good work he has done in in my heart for it has been my prayer all along you see when you you pray a prayer to the Lord you do not know how or when but he will always answer those prayers and and then it's she says in capital letters thank you Lord amen then she also says I also appreciate the pastor of this church for this wonderful work and good Revelation come from God and you obeyed it thank you Pastor may God richly bless you Sister Mary amen then this is Sister Esther you also have a testimony can you come up bless your Saints I may testimony the devil has been tormenting my life ever since maybe I was nine years I was doing some things that are not good I have someone who can testify about that Sharon she used to tell me Batista why do you do that you're a young girl and I was like you know no one loves me I'm all alone in this world God has left me my mother is not here so I'm alone that had become my anthem every time no one loves me and Sharon used to say I'm tired of that word stop saying it but I don't know why so when the devil saw that one talk on me he brought something else try to kill me in my body I mean my spirit when he told her when it also did not work out I was going to have motor accidents race that also didn't work out and then he tried to bring out something else for everyone in my family to hate me but when brother America was preaching I don't even know how at the moment he said you know some people you say no one loves me everyone hates me I was like oh is this brother unknown because at that very moment I was thinking about that and they say God loves you and another time Pastor was also preaching and he said even if you don't care God cares even if you think no one cares God will still care for you when brother Michael said that and they remember the words Pastor said I thought that burden was off of my heart I was not going to come to the altar but I wanted to come but still something you told me don't bother going if you go no everyone will laugh at you don't go but I don't even know I just opened my eyes and found myself here kneeling down I thank God that he delivered me but bless you [Applause] and if you have that Spirit of Rejection on you even right now I cast it out in the name of Jesus Christ you know that's a bad Spirit it brings many many things and we thank God that he still delivers you believe that he still delivers Amen brother yes are you are you there are you ready this is an amazing testimony he shared it with me a little bit of wheat I don't know how far he will go in sharing it tonight but uh let us allow him to come this is our brother doing the streaming okay you can come up thank you sister hope from enter the church you can also prepare to come after brother amen God bless you all I don't have where to start from because a testimony it's all the same so I want to start with the scripture sing Galatians chapter 6 verse 8. all right I won't take long but spanning so chapter 8 says for he that soweth in his for he that sow it to his phrase shall of the fresh rip corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life then another one is in Romans oh Romans chapter 8 all right chapter 8 verse yeah versatile are therefore breathing we are datas not the phrase to live after the fresh get that word for if ye live after the flesh he shall die whatsoever kind of death but if you through the spirit do modify the Deeds of the body it shall live for as many as laid by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption where we cry Abba Father so I just realized from Friday through the meetings on Saturday on Sunday today some came out in me that I had never seen I realized I had it's coming to 10 years since I believed and brother Isaac when he was preaching this way he mentioned that there are some people who think like they say that hey for us even if when we were in our mother's wombs we were saying amen and they think that serves them and it's absurd so thought about myself I believed I were under the custody again under the guidance like under a pastor so I was a pastor's son from there I came to him still I became his son so I would have also been like one of those people who say maybe because it's like that stay with the pasta is near me Maybe his righteousness is okay so being too many places many conventions here and abroad but this was a life-changing situation I was there walking alone but sometimes the musician this is this the mission this goes to you sometimes we be you know they are praying that spirit is moving but because you're praying the piano you don't yield and at the end of the door it goes we end up getting nothing because we think we're working for the Lord by throwing that day comes I don't think that would be an excuse so ourselves was going on happens but but his name was something big saint putting that thing there and moving if it falls whatsoever happens Let It Be I came this was on Saturday uh after the morning service when I were here we were many I don't even remember I may wear like besides me so the ministers came and started praying you know and I had one prayer I want the this phrase to die and yeah it has been on my heart you know like everyone in this Christian Journey we are in fresh and we do many things that we think no one is seeing us you know at school at our workplaces we identify that we are born again say for me I'm born again that's how we we say but your words it could be the and uh the things that happen let's say you know your work we are having a party and yes you say I'm I'm born again but when there are those things that other those people do uh you also take part and I believe it's a reproach Christ right so I always say that yeah that was my prayer I didn't have anything else we have any other Pro we have other problems but then I had only one prayer and that was it so as I were needing here the ministers they they were praying and I don't know it was uh touched prayed I was also praying I was feeling one thing someone is going to come and touch my head and pray with me and that will be so I am touching my shoulders prayed like when you didn't pray and moment came one Minister came and before that one was judging me but I didn't do it so I were praying one Minister came and laid the hands on me and that was it felt it's really done rhythm I can't just fight you that I'm no longer a Slave To Fear slave to sin and all the services that had been preached it's been all about my life I don't know about you but me everything a hundred percent so I had never been saved since I was even the best I mentioned it I had never been saved unto you that moment I hope these finds you in a situation whichever situation you may be in it's the only way to go God bless you that's my testimony when that happens there is no better way to explain it by the way you can't explain it the words we are hearing here these people speaking it's just that at the tip of the iceberg that is there's much more that the Lord has done in their life but this is just a little to encourage you also if you've not attained amen uh we appreciate God you know the musicians you know the people that work in the church sometimes they we you miss a lot you I wonder I was in in Kenya I was in western western Kenya and and the Holy Spirit was so interesting the service and and then one young man was at the altar praying and everybody was praying everybody in the church was praying and then the Holy Spirit was just so intense in the service and then this young man started to speak in tongues out loud and so there was like a hush in the congregation and at that time as he was concluding to um to speak in the tongues the Holy Ghost Just Came Upon me and I was going to bust out in the interpretation of those tanks and I I had I had spoken like a one or two and then there was another brother who was incidentally a Pianist sorry a guitarist I don't know which kind of guy was playing and then he got up quickly on on his feet with his guitar in his hands and he put it up in this in in like in the air and he started interpreting the tongues that the other brother had spoken but you see the first two words he spoke was exactly what I had put out on my mouth so I held my peace but the Holocaust was just bubbling in my heart and he said everything that the leader that the first ones he said was exactly what was in my heart to say and then the rest of it that he interpreted but look this brother was a a guitarist if he had not yielded enough to the Holy Ghost you see God would not have used him and when that moment when that happened oh my God that was like you know someone had taken the Holy Spirit and powered it upon everybody there was like a very wonderful worship and so friends that's what we want to have in our fellowship in our fellowships where even the musicians and all the people that work there as people streaming and everybody is touched by the anointing of the holy spirit amen uh who did I call Sister Florence from interview are you here okay you have to be fast because we we have a few more and uh if you've not written I will not call you so you're going to miss out so uh if I call you come a little quickly so you can get to conclude bless your church ah okay and I'm here to testify I think I'm one of the last people that I sent in my testimony and then boom I had to say it I would love it when Pastor said he wanted us to give our testimonies it is not a question and answer session but it's a testimony session Something Told Me I didn't believe that I had to tell the testimony I trembled I was like I'm not doing this but then when I was sitting the sister Florence was like do you think it's worth keeping quiet I just returned my paper right now and I believe what I'm going to say someone else might have gone through it and I pray God will change you um this partner has called me on Wednesday she told me hope let's go for the convention I told her I don't have money but I had 70 000 on me I was like I don't have money I will not go then I sat down I looked at my two friends sleep my roommates but then I did not get sleep in me I sat on a stool and I listened to the song see what the Lord has done I listened to that song more than seven times then something told me you go there you'll get a piece of mine I was battling depression I felt I'm alone I felt I'm rejected I had hatred I had always prayed for God to pick a call like he picked for prophet Isaiah and passed it on his lips that they could no longer speak and clean and that was me today God did it for me I am no longer the same this morning when Pastor was concluding actually a pastor was finalizing the the morning devotion I felt the angel of the Lord stand right next to me and something was like if you don't hold on me now it is now or never I do not know but I felt electricity goes through me and I shouted oh my joy that trials my soul I now know that test of Freedom glory to Jesus I now know what it tastes like to be a true Christian when you're free from what the world holds you accountable for you could go and pray and something tells you um when new friends are not there you talk about about them and now are you wasting your time here praying yesterday in the morning Division I have my best friend she's brother Enoch's sister she's called memory my heart told me today you're not praying for yourself you are praying for memory it told me a Christian does not live for themselves a Christian lives for others I prayed for my sister and I don't know I now feel free to talk about her I feel the burden has been lifted I told God she is not here at this moment she might have missed it but Lord she will not miss my prayer I knew one thing that the Lord has been so good to me and the Lord will be so good to her I want to thank God for the ministers every time they preached I felt attached there is no moment it passed me there is no moment I felt I was not home this is my first time attending meetings but if history needs to be written I am writing it down I want to thank God today for I can sing I am no longer the same God bless you [Applause] that is the Hope God bless you so much is the Hope for that wonderful testimony amen sister Florence are you here also can you brothers be helping me with this microphone God bless you Chad my name is can you can you come like this side I'm really too scared foreign speaking they told us to admit it like when you're scared you admit it before the people and you can't get the confidence I believe God has given it to me yes so I never wanted to give my testimony in the first place but then something touched me and I was like really I can't do this I fear standing before the people but now I feel like I'm not scared anymore yes one thing my dad disowned me after believing taught me you either be a Catholic or a Christian if you're a Christian may I don't give birth to Christians you watch out of my God so I just stood and I said God just help me this is too much on me I love my dad so much it was really too much for me to choose but I had to choose Christ I told my dad you know what I'm a born again I'm served I love your dad and I'm going with Christ he started slapping me and you got a stick and he started hitting me I went out of my father's home when he's throwing stones on me like oh you silly girl did I take you at campus to start being a Christian silly thing so I say to God this cross is too much on me now you told us to take our cross and follow you dead but I'm taking this one God please bear it with me I went out when I I was in a night because he did it early in the morning and Sanders I just stayed when I stepped out of the gate I said to God as long as I get a church or he's gonna be well some of you know me as Pastor like brother Michael's child but I'm not brother Michael's daughter he's just adopted me like after being thrown out yes that man is a good person and really Christians we need to show our works because me I had just come in so when I go to church until they charge they I talked to the pastor my dad never used like he never wanted me to pray whenever he could Pine he could find me praying he used to tell me I told you to pray millember Maria and Stephanie that's all why are you wasting time praying these Christian things in being saved what kind of silly thing is that so I say to God help me but I kept on believing me I had lost hope like I used to ask myself how am I going to leave my father's home because for us we used to just stay in that gate not going out not doing nothing used to take us at school and bring us back home we used to be so irritated and sometimes we could just sneak out and do certain silly things I could I won't talk about them now but I found God damn saved and I stood for Christ I'm encouraging you Christians please stand with the Lord so I was going through something this week actually not this week but through this holiday me and my journalist by profession but I ended up in teaching since I was by the time I left my father's my father's home I was a directories I was running my father's School brother Julius from interview Church some of you know him he's the one who witnessed to me this gospel he came he found me when I'm a Pentecostal I used to love the Lord I used to move with the radio around past that Thomas radio you know Pastor told me I used to listen to that man I could always love the word so my father used to always squirrel I don't want to listen to that thing switch it off what words but since there was a seed in me it kept me going that thing kept me going I wasn't stopped even if it took me choosing between my dad and and Jesus I say it Lord I'm choosing you I did not choose him my me myself I believe he's the one who chose me because I couldn't do that it's undoable it's really hard like leaving your father it's hard I remember the first day I sat with my dad I missed that there like always because I knew which when it was going to happen I knew it I prayed I felt a burden on my heart and I was like I'm leaving this home soon I used to tell my sisters do you know you guys I'm leaving this place soon they couldn't believe me they just kept on laughing they said please you're running mad with that Christianity of yours so when that day came the Lord Jesus gave me the scripture of Luke 1 37 when Pastor you preached about that word I was really blessed because that is my word I keep it I keep it I I keep it as my word because he told me the Holy Ghost shall overshadow there and you will be able to do it really the Holy Ghost overshadowed me and I was able to do it so when I lived with brother Michael for some like I live with him for one and a half yeah yes after this barrier I left his home around May and I got a job there was a certain woman had meters Pro you know it's Pro where we collect exams from I had going to collect exams for my school and she also had one there to get exams so we exchanged contacts as directors and she wanted to visit our school so we did all that and I came to know her so God doesn't do things accident tell that woman happened like she's the one who gave me that job after some time when I had left the other she did not give me the interview I remember I was not a teacher by profession but since I had that experience I was running the school that is how I was able to get that job so when I got that job I I've walked they're not giving me a lot of money but now the way the lady was acting she's she's this kind of a person who doesn't that she doesn't she doesn't have administrative skills she does she just runs her school as if she's managing kids and teachers she's treating teachers as children disrespecting them now me who whom she had helped she has always been telling people I just helped that one she doesn't even have papers I helped her so I was really fed up with that thing I said God I'm really tired of this hypocrisy this woman can come and laugh with me and then go to other people and tell her this and that I said Lord I'm leaving this place I'm not going to work for these people again so then I talked to mommy brother Michael's wife I told her mommy I really don't feel like going back to this place I'm crying every night for sure my pillow has been full of tears I've been crying every night that is what led me here to come for these conversions because I did not know it's hope that one where she's the one who told me on Wednesday that's when I came to know I had only 50 000 with me I said God even if I use it all I don't know what will happen after but let me go for these conversions I really felt depressed I had pain I was crying I said God please help me when I came here I thought that peace when the word was preached I felt encouraged Christians I'm telling you it is really hard to talk to people when you want them to encourage you like to to tell to what are you the other seat that is in you that you can even if you live you leave that job there is there is something God can do I told them I believe God can do something even if I leave this job I'm too stress I can't really money it was even if I go to that school I just my heart just like I just feels too stressed I really can't work in such an environment and apparently I've been sleeping in that lady's house she offered me a house so it is at your house I have to to to leave it so I was really stressed I said good now if I go away from this job I have no father he disowned me if I go whenever where am I going to go should I go back to brother Mike was home the man who has never to help me up to now should I really go back yet I don't want to work here everyone was telling me Florence one bad in your hand is better than 10 birds in the bush you don't know about I was really discouraged I said to God this is not your word Mark 11 22 says have faith in God is that word in vain I said good you're a boyfriend if I leave this job you can still provide so when brother Mike who preached about faith stuff and he said God can strengthen those those ones who are weak I really felt strengthened so after talking to some brothers this evening I was I was there eating supper and then something touched me and told me like if the testimony to this brother I talked to a certain brother when they had my Testament they told me sister you can even if you leave that job you can but all people like my friends from my favorite imitating me Florence don't leave that job don't live and I'm a person who always want to listen to advice I said God if I felt I would say we're told I should not listen I said what you know me I'm just a red Seth by your grace I'm just alone here because it's really do you know the feeling of feeling alone when no one can help you you have not that life you can cry and tell him that I need this and he can provide you all alone providing for yourself so it was really hard I was too stressed I said now I'm done if I leave this job what is going to happen and then on the other side I heard faith I said good if I left my father's home and you've looked after me up to now will you really fail if I leave this job you will not fail isn't it Brethren I said what you can so those Brothers have really encouraged me they have told me you can't and the message has really also encouraged me I can I'm going to leave that job I won't get I won't die because of my job I know my God will not leave me alone God bless you thank you so much something about being rejected and suffering reports for Christ my mother told me if you're going to believe that stuff I'm disowning you you're no longer my son but you see God can turn things around in our favor if we decide to accept reproach for the sake of Christ I know that God will not disappoint you my sister uh there is a sister what's the name of the system where's the star begin you gave you I think I we lost your paper but God remembered you've come praise God Church um I want to sound good that I'm here because I know God doesn't do things by coincidence but I can literally say I'm here I think God had his own programs right now I think I would be at home having supper because it was actually rather Enoch who told me on Sunday that sister Abby we have this uh this this convention on Friday and like I'd not even heard anything about it but I had so many questions that I'd been asking that I listened to Pentecostal pastors a lot until I found that their messages to our preaching while being repeated over and over again and they were still not answering my questions because and that led me to read my Bible because there's a pastor who came to our church and I noticed every time he read a scripture and the scripture seemed to turn into our Paradox he would go to another scripture and that scripture would answer that question so I was like if we could find answers in this Bible I actually read my Bible every night but I would read as a religion you know how you read and you don't get anything that's how I was I started with the New Testament I started understanding Testament when I was about to finish I finished it and I went to some was very nice but I wasn't enjoying it because there are so many nice things and I was so busy trying to get a prescription in my head until I reached a point and I was like God I don't want scriptures to turn into a Bad Thing help me to understand the scripture and enjoy reading it until finally helped me and told me a big girl you want to enjoy because I was reading Psalms and Samuel at the same time first Samuel like the somewhere you read past Samuel is the same way I want you to read psalms because faster mode is a story so there's really not much to memorize so I started drinking sums and I really felt like everything was flowing it was like I was speaking with David and I started understanding so I I kept on looking for answers and at some point I was like I wanted to read a chapter from every book because I thought like there's still certain questions I want to answer and like I would read scriptures in the Bible and I sit on my bed for about 15 minutes trying to meditate on that scripture and find an answer but I'll feel God telling me you keep reading I'll answer that question and I I would I had so many answers I would even forget them even I had questions I feel like God would read my mind because like I'd I'd have questions in my mind that somehow I know God might tell me this one to wait so I don't ask him the question and I just keep it in my mind and I even don't know I asked it but I know I did but I came to this convention and I really felt like God was telling me listen to those pastors because I was beginning to question what you are telling me you know how we like start putting a filter in your head when the pastor is preaching to get only what you need you told me don't do that that is me speaking if you want to get the answers to those questions you have been asking it's going to be now so I put aside that filter and I decided to listen I thank God that he has answered all my questions and also another thing when Pastor Mike was preaching and Pastor Isaac they kept on talking about certain things he talked about Pride they talked about fear and something else that are forgotten but he talked about prayed and honestly I was proud and I didn't know it I was very proud and Nega sister who was next to me pointed at no I was like are you proud and I felt like for real I'm proud I looked at myself and like my mom told me there's certain blessings God did not give me because honestly if you gave me that blessing I was going to disgrace his name and then when she told me that I was like if I have because I talked about what she was talking about she was extremely confident to the point that she couldn't keep quiet and I felt like I had that same issue and man I was thinking I was being confident it was prayed it was real prayed and I told God about blessings that you're supposed to give me if this is the problem then take it away I left it at that but when I think it was Pastor Isaac he talked about Pride I felt like it's still there he talked about fear I thought I wasn't scared but in 2019 at school we had a Christmas production and they said that everyone is going to come in black jeans and for that as in the choir they say black jeans and a plain white T-shirt and by genes I'm not talking about jeans Cuts I mean Jean trousers and I don't wear trousers so in my mind I was thinking of Naman I was like what part of Norman so I told my mom they said changing trousers but maybe we can ask God for a pattern I I was the only one at school who did not wear trousers and I was the only believer you know at least you can just find a Pentecostal to identify with who doesn't wear trousers but as the only person so somehow my mom talks to the principal and they get me a long black skirt but let me tell you ever since that moment I felt mentally tortured I wanted to skip that that production I really wanted to skip it and then the principle comes and gives me a prayer role at the end as look like I'm not going to my mom so that I can stay at home and ask me why didn't you come and I give them some funny excuse but in the principle says oh we want you to pray at the end of the production because it was like a Christian School so I couldn't skip to make matters worse God made sure that the principal's daughter your man looked at me with this face and told me they say trousers and though she emphasizes I remember that time they say pants say trousers like I don't know what they are honestly look at my girlfriends they looked like they were they had so many questions that they didn't want to show at me they kept on complimenting my skirt but let me tell you I didn't enjoy that I didn't enjoy it at all to make matters worse what if it comes you go back to school and they said they are going to change their uniform security from doesn't fit you can come in casual wear until they fix the uniform so everyone is coming casual and you're the only one in trousers I know casual wear children want to show off I don't really think that was in their agenda but they were all in trousers who are extensive and a principal to say no trousers above your knees because there are kids who come in Petras their kids would come in crop tops and you really think how can children do this and you're the only one in skirts and to make matters whilst they would ask you why don't you wear trousers and I do know what to tell them because they're scared I do want to offend them I don't want to confuse them and I was mentally tortured I wear skirts all the time and like I only had two skirts that I knew I could wear to school and they're all going short and I remember time I stopped wearing my spots where I used to wear my sports were shot with mainly from Scott and they asked me why aren't you wearing your sports wear what your sports wear Skies like the short skirts a Canon primary way like you have shorts but they're skirts they asked me why aren't you wearing them and I say that they were short and asked me how short and I told them like yeah and they said ah what's happening yes in here or maybe even higher because they are like I can't walk out of the getting a Patra and I looked at them and but I want to thank God because later on the uniform turned out to be trousers but because they let the high schoolers like just what they wanted because I think the principal wanted them to be free or something of that sort and I was the only one of course who doesn't wear trousers the uniform it turned out to be trousers and my mom again had to talk to the principal and mine turned out to be scared and at that point I was I was beginning to recover from that torture and then they said they only from his cut so somehow I just take a deep breath and I'm like God we're going to go through this together like as they could if you squeeze hands I think I need to feel you squeezing mine to like hold me tight so that can go through this because I don't get pushed at this time let's do this together and so like they they talk to my mom and they first give me my my sweater they give me my sweater and my friends are like because at this point they're only I don't wear trousers and I think they gave up asking me because every time they ask me I'll give them different answers I don't do our trousers until this one something else and you told the add-ons I finally had upset would be that lie that it's my parents and I knew for real even if my parents were not around I wouldn't wear them so I I planned on blaming it on them but finally I knew that was wrong so if they would ask me if I don't know what to tell them I'd rather keep quiet or find a way to go around it but I wouldn't lie I decided to stand with it so I've been forgotten where I was yes that's the jumper part so I get I get my sweater and they come out oh you're kidding okay so like here I come with all these questions like I noticed I was still scared that experience there's a way it broke me that if I went back to school I would still hide my faith and he talked about fear I thought fear was not talking to me but I stood there I think it was maybe this morning I noticed that I'm actually scared I told God I'm scared I need you to make me bold and this morning I was talking to her sister she told me no Abigail you have to be strong you have to testify you have to tell them that truth like this time I'm going back to school I'm not going to hide my faith I'm meant to be bold even if they ask me questions I'll tell them the truth I won't hide why I don't wear trousers I won't hide why I don't wear short skirts I'll tell them the truth and I thank God that he has delivered me from Pride and thank God that I'm not scared anymore [Applause] God bless you these are all wonderful testimonies now I I understand and we really want to hear everything on the background that has led to what God has done for you but because of time and because of more people here that wants to testify I'm going to request you to just hit the point I came to the meetings the Lord has done this for me is that okay amen can I call Brother mukisha Dania God bless his Saints I thank God for I'm here and I thank God for the ministry yeah my my testimony is I didn't have money to come to this conversion by the Lord provided away and uh I was I was talking to our pastor in ginger so you told me that he's going to come I didn't plan it that I didn't know that he was coming to the youth convention but he told me he was coming so he said we can't go together in the morning he brought me up this place paid for me everything I thank God for that and another thing I thank God that he has delivered me out of I I don't know I can explain it but when pastor called that uh some used to come here the ones that really feel a burden of ministering I really fear talking to come to the congregation but I said Lord have my life even if I fear top people I I at times I fear talking to people like a big congregation like this one I really fear so I said how will I do it I feel the fear inside me I said but there's some things that came to my mind I said by the minister is not all about coming to the pulpit so you see our minister of God in any way yeah God bless amen Hallelujah that that sister what's your name sister Lydia are you Lydia Our Sister Abigail what your point you taught us a lot a lot that was building up to this but I trust that many got your point you see are you able to take a stand when you are at school because this is a very important thing do you know that you find yourself in a situation when you are the only believer when you are the only one that has to take a stand and say I do not wear trousers or I don't wear short skirts Believers these days I begin to wear a mini secrets foreign Believers of the message shame on you if you do that it means you do not know what you believe I believe you should be able to take a stand and tell your friends I don't do that why because I'm a Christian but I'm a Christian too no I'm a different kind of Christian they will want to know what type of Christian you are and then you will lead them to church that's what we have to do so sister that boldness you have received here today take it and it will spread like wildfire in your school brother Daniel I believe that fear has gone he just spoke you just spoke so that fear is gone amen God just gave you boldness too amen um brother Daniel I love the way you kept it so short and precise to the point everybody else you like that okay so uh sister fortunate [Applause] praise God Church I thought so much for these meetings and all the ministers and everyone who came I thank God so much who he has delivered me most of the times we pray and ask ourselves before we we fail to forgive ourselves you're praying and the devil is telling you your sin now you know I remember my brother Polly Cup who are praying sometime and he said sometimes the devil lies to you a sinner but today I prayed and I feel I'm free you pray and you feel your prayers are not going but I feel I'm free and I I believe it's finished whatever I've not got today my faith says it's finished and I'm going to get it as I end I urge all the youth to keep praying we it is finished it's finished but keep praying yes and the ministers should also keep praying for us when you are there out there and in here prayer prayer prayer is important amen as a brother Andrew where's brother Andrew Bakker is he there okay oh you are you you have a testimony yes I'm calling you thank you Pastor God bless you Church I thank God for all of you everything thank God for my life first of all I thank God for these meetings by the grace of the by the grace of God I've been on the organizing committee as a vice chairperson but I've seen the hand of God in this we prepared these meetings on a short note but I've seen goddess hand the first prayer for this meeting when I was in my room I prayed God because we we did not have enough food and the projection was was about 100 people but we are overwhelmed by about 300 people so we did not have enough food I pray remember that prayer I told God that you who fed them altitude with the five bread and two fish you're going to feed our youth to our coming and I've been in the kitchen I've seen that God has blessed us we have faith our visitors and I'm happy for that I thank God so much [Applause] I so got this hand when I was speaking to service providers from from those who supplied as water the chairs the attained where we're buying meat where we were buying milk from they were just easy and simple and giving us no hardship so I thank God so much even the cooks they never had in our life so I thank God so much another testimony I have I work in a printing company where we I import I'm the procurement of this and I import uh substrates papers from from from from China and other other countries so when I went to my new job in agar in September I found an ongoing procurement of about 170 rolls of substrates but the supply and the shipping company told us that the expected time of arrival of those substrates will be 16th January and they were this procurement took a lot of time because our supplier did not have enough qualification to pass the pivot certificate so I'm not explain the payback certificate it do not take time but you need it so if to prove that those goods you're bringing into our country are on of standard so it played for about three months to get that certificate but the boss has been on my neck so much the paper has crossed around just buying them from the supplier was about 150 million Uganda Shillings that's just buying uh shipping them to our country the shipper about six about about uh uh six thousand dollars just to ship taxes about 60 million so my boss has been on my neck he thought he told me in Uganda foreign get lost you also get lost I'll look for you so I've been on pressure now the challenge came that the shipper told me that Basics teams the assignment will be in Uganda but on the 16th it was still at the border being held because our business didn't had a problem and I had planned that by 16 I would be done by this pressure so that 19 is the meeting time I can be able to do my work but Saturn came in by 16th had not received these Goods even on Fifth on that day when I was supposed to ask for my leave I'm the one under organizing committee I emphasized that every every member of the committee should ask for a leave so that to be able to serve very well but me when I went to ask they leave they didn't Grant it they said you cannot how do you leave this world and and how do you how can you dedicate it this maturity so I thank God on Friday when I was working there in the kitchen I received a call and they told me your things are coming you need to be at work I use like a motorcycle they nearly knocked me because of that Consignment but I thank God on Saturday I officially received that Consignment and put it in store [Applause] every thank God for the preaching that has been going on I missed many of them especially brother either as reaching I when I was behind there I nearly I nearly stopped what I was doing to come and attend the meeting but I said again how will I come and people not eat that that something told me you're going to stream and you're going to to to be placed in the same way like those who were on the source I thank God so much I managed to attend brother Mike was two meetings I could come and sneak and then go back and go about so may the Lord bless you all may God bless the vessels of whom he has used may God bless you all and on behalf of the organizing committee I would like to say that in case there is anything which went wrong please forgive us may God bless you so much so I allowed him more time because he was supposed to speak earlier in the past service but they were not around but for the rest 2-2 minutes so if it hits two minutes I don't be offended when I stop you I think I have three or four more and then uh and then we shall close amen we thank God for brother Andrew and the others that really did their best to make sure that we had food and everything was going well let us give a hand of praise to God for them [Applause] Sister Mary and uh we know that God has done for you wherever you've been we want testimonies of what God has done for you in these meetings so if you don't have anything that God has done for you in these meetings you can keep that and give it in your home Church all right God bless you chat but excuse me I want to use my language which is Uganda it's okay praise the Lord for his grace when I had not yet because [Music] I had many trials since long ago until when my cousin brother died when we don't know what has led to his death after that appetite for food and whatever which was to be eaten yet she wasn't sick one day I was sleeping after this night prayers foreign [Music] you can you cannot come back when natural get the winter the thing left me my name is I told her to pray I had just prayed during that night mixer foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] may the Lord which bless you that victory is mine I'm no longer going to be defeated amen amen God bless you Sister Mary from Lucaya come on okay uh there is this one who said I hope I've not lost there is someone who said they had a burning testimony I read it but I have lost it okay this one is saying God bless you all up okay she says apologies I can't sit on my testimony allow me testify sister peace come and testify I've allowed you God bless you Saints I'm really really happy to be here let's find this I didn't is that on the microphone I didn't really want to testify like I was asking myself live and do I have a testimony but this evening hey I realized I have a testimony now I didn't know I was going to come like seriously I didn't know I was going to make for these meetings I didn't have any money I didn't where I borrowed money from I had already borrowed so that morning that morning uh brother Pastor boss called me and told me you're coming I was like I I don't have money I was like what if you really wanted to come for these meetings you would borrow but where I borrowed from I've already bought it but thank God that is where I asked us my brother-in-law he managed to give me the money and I managed to come and attend and even pay it back I'm happy so I'm really grateful that he made a way for me to come and how he has confirmed it for me that these meetings really were meant for me is I had a dream sometime ago that was 27th of July last year so brother Pastor Isaac when he was ministering yesterday he spoke of this second stanza over when the battle is over and he was like um it was like um it says um must I be courage to the skies on flowery bedok East While others fought to win the praise and sailed through blood disease so he mentioned that and I remember there is a dream I had last year and I was singing We were singing in a youth meeting and for me I don't like attending youth meetings as such even rather Pastor was asked me you did you attend the Guyana meetings I was like no he was like you should be attending these meetings so and then I dreamed that I was in a youth meeting and we were singing that very song that Sam Sam's tanza and we were with the brother Moses who played the keyboard yesterday here and we were singing so that morning I texted him that was last year I was like you know I dreamed about you that we were singing the second stanza even the the dream is still here in my phone was like I dreamed about you that we were serious in a youth meeting singing this song or this second stance that emphasized on the second stanza and when brother Michael came here he also showed us that same stanza he said I printed this thing at my place Brad Isaac also printed his in his place but it is the same thing so then when when he spoke that and I remembered this dream and I texted him this evening I was like do you remember the Dream I Dreamed that's you know when a youth meeting and we're singing this song A circumstance of when the battle is over we shall wear a crown it was like ah how is that even possible then I resent for him that dream was like oh I remember but hey it is rare for me to even attend youth meeting so it was almost impossible for me so I was like oh thank you Lord you made it possible for me to attend and you saw me in this day that I'll be attending these youth meetings he has confirmed it for me and I thank God for it God bless you praise the Lord you see no one is here by mistake let me repeat that no one came to these meetings by mistake you see so whatever you had even what you are doubting that God did not do I want to assure you God has done if he saw you here then he did not come here by mistake or for nothing his purpose has been achieved and accomplished in your life there is this one who the last one just told me I request to testify but you didn't post your name so I don't know who you are I think one of you young men gave me this paper is from who oh you just wanted me to God what's your name sister I'm Sir John um I wrote badshit but when you read that changed my mother like I'm not going to testify now like it's good I didn't put that name so now when I said we are going to investigate I'm like oh God I'll be a good half just come here meeting [Music] I want to thank God for the Holy Ghost baptism he has granted unto me um and when we came in this service the pastor preached about hindrances something that okay like he talked about small things say that times we consider some things to be small so you overlook them saying it's a small one then he gave an example and said in case you are having he gave some weeds it is she gave down that was some small weights but then he said you keep moving you keep moving you're in Uganda by the time you reach Kenya for example there is a steep he gave an example of mountain s so was like however little that way it might be by the time you reach there it will be very hard for you to claim that step so I had a I I I thank God that the Lord saved me I had like some small hindrance the star first for me I started from a message School the pastor preaches you're not supposed to have boyfriends they're not supposed to to engage in a relationship so I I believe this as like yes you are not supposed but there is a way like and like the whole thing I don't involve I cannot fall into fornication let me keep it at that pace so the brother is a Brotherhood I don't know that it was brother brother Isaac he gave an exam there's a brother in his church no it was in the morning the brother said he told the brother the brother told him for me I attacked the devil slowly I don't I don't rush so I was like so now the brother said by the time right now that the brother left the church he fell into fornication so it had been a bad thing to me every time because every time they preach it but for me there's a way I don't I didn't I didn't open up myself to let it forsake everyone like to live all over them so every time you feel like you're going to leave this one you're like okay one deeper I'm not supposed to like for the world that for a second I've left but again they're like even Believers it's I'm still standing they're like you that stuff it's nonsense so really in this service the Lord has given me a great Victory he has delivered in my life I'm free I'm free from all that I'm not there's no bondage holding me that was a small Hindus but time came it was Heavy I was still living in british talking about it I thought I I thought I had left those things like I thought I don't involve I have no boyfriend but they start seeing you don't tell that person boldly Who You Are so anyway thank God for the delivery amen God bless you all I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I request you to pray for my mother she called Ali this morning saying she feels uh burning under her feet and she feels a lot of body weakness and I believe by your prayers she uh can receive instant healing now this is Sister faith I don't know whether she's the one who came here okay is your mother still sick she she's now well I'm talking to another one she's now well yes amen um then this uh Oh Sister Irene saying she wrote a paper but it did not reach me so whatever you put it forgive them but God has remembered you so you come and be the last [Applause] praise God brethren I was really going to miss this chance uh my very first testimony it's about our lunch time as we were having lunch ahead people saying that oh God this food is not going to be enough uh people are so many already on the line and more are coming I think I shared this testimony with sister Judith yeah she's right there and I sat down and I told God please feed us like multiply this food and to my surprise and for you who are there you know we ate food to a moment that they call people to get more food yes yeah maybe the brother who said this didn't know that someone had him but I had had him and I had to pray to God I thank him that you really fed us we didn't know what you went through to give us the food but I thank God that we all got satisfied and my testimony for these meetings it is very very first time to attend youth meetings you know he is at him that certain meetings and all that but my testimony would be so long but I'm trying to figure out how to shorten it uh my testimony really started when Pastor Jose preached in the set of conventions about having an encounter with good but I understood that someone that I got patience in my mind that were not answered as they could what should I do I'm supposed to meet you but I don't know how I'm going to do this of course there are so many faults in my life it's me alone who knows the behind of the sins of my life I will not go to prove that but I really asked God to show me what to do uh of course I put up some things between that someone like between the moment of that sermon till Friday of this meeting but still I felt it was not finished I felt there was something that I was still lagging on to that I had to really put off um you know I was growing girls we go through so many things sometimes we even get so embarrassed to talk about them I know someone out there is also speaking the same thing as I'm saying but uh when I came to this meeting just to tell you shortly I was the one mobilizing the youths in my church that is evening light brighter is Judge but trust me I didn't have the money I was receiving people's money I didn't have any coin on me I only had 3 000 Shillings in my bag and someone mocked me was like you're the one mobilizing for this but you've not yet paid I was like ah good thing I'm giving the money to me so I will just take it and then I remembered the timer was that there was a time I was to Nairobi I'd kept some Kenyan shillings on me it was almost 2 000 Kenyan shillings I remembered this money I have it in my drawer I got the money I exchanged it very very fast and that's how I ended up coming here with a p a feature faith and I'm grateful about that then with the questions that I had kept from the encounter with God I'm really grateful those questions have been answered I'm a person I met a child by a profession but at my person who likes keeping young I don't know I'm not so old uh but I was keeping young in the wrong way I'm not ashamed to say this I'm a person who is on tick tock you know when they were talking about this I looked at these people talking to me as if they were in my phone you know I sometimes sleep very late but on tick tock sometimes by this time me I'm awake you know but I'm on tick tock like it's really hard to say it out I'm either on tick tock or on a call with a very wrong individual yes so I really thank good for these meetings because there is a special way I feel right now like there is a way I feel like erasing everything in my phone of course there are no dirty things but I feel I should have a new phone like new contacts near everything and I know there is some other person that is going through the certain thing as I was mobilizing you it's in my church there is a gentleman I called he has daughters that I expected to be here but they didn't make it but before I even told you my reason for the call he was like Irene you're wasting a lot of time I was like how hey how why is this the first thing you're telling me so on my way to the convention is I was asking myself how am I wasting time like how am I wasting time he told me broadly you're supposed to be married by this time before before they got married they used to go to mountains and prayer I was like we don't have those things anymore how am I wasting time like what should I do but trust me Believers I now know who I am I now know what I'm supposed to do I now know how I've been wasting all this time I now know that I'm really sad and I've met my encounter with God it's a lengthy but let me stop it at that I really thank God for pasta and the ministers may God richly bless you uh my testimony when I told it was very long when he was telling us to write oh that we shall testify I was like uh-uh I don't have any testimony and I remember him saying it will be a testimony for some of you to testify and sincerely speaking it is a testimony that I got a testimony to testify unto the Lord may God richly bless you amen God bless you Sister Irene there are some how many here how many here don't worry I've asked you a lot of questions this is the last one how many here have smartphones smartphones no it's a SmartPhone looks like this to some of you who don't know a smartphone looks like this just raise up your hand if you have a smartphone how many don't okay but you have a phone now to those of you who have smartphones you you've had a testimony of Sister Irene now I thank God that I started these matters of relationship and Court courtship before WhatsApp was invented but I know we've not talked about these things and people came expecting us talk about them but what what you had was much more important than us talking about those things because you you've had the Holy Spirit was already doing the work and I believe also he has done in some of your lives so you see what I was saying is we used to write letters if you had the love of your life and you love them so much you write a letter and you know you make sure you use a very good handwriting and you know you draw some hearts on there and so you like make the letter very appealing to her eyes so that she can give you a response and you even put some tears maybe you say you see this now some of you don't know those things because you have WhatsApp now this was good but at that time for you to do that even to write a letter and send it it would be very difficult very difficult if you especially if you're a Believer it would be very difficult you you know there is a lot of process involved to write that to to get the paper to get the the good pain to write to put Power your heart sit down think about what you are going to write you know you know make sure you are your hands are dry and there's a lot of process and then you sit down and begin to put yourself in the mood of writing and then you begin writing and then you have to find someone to give that letter to check with the person you are sending it to and you have to make sure that person is faithful does not look at the letter you know the process was so long so that by the time by the time you think about the whole thing just change your mind I will not write the letter after all but nowadays with this Smartphone in just one minute you you have sent you have sent and received messages not only messages pictures not only pictures videos and you find the devil actually taking over your lives let me tell you these smartphones can actually take you to hell if you're not careful because the things that come on there if you don't filter it some of the groups that you are in actually some of you should make a decision to leave them before you leave this place before you leave your hostel in the morning make a decision to leave some of those groups you are in those groups you are like okay I'm a Believer but this one is a group of my friends and but the things they are posting there are influencing your life in a negative way why do you keep there okay sister why do you keep chatting you know with the 10 Brothers at the same time are you going to marry all of them sincerely think about it so to me I think um that's why sisters brothers can propose to sisters and at the end of the day the sister is not accepting to accept any of them because she's not too sure who is the best among them but if you are if you are speaking to someone who has gone through the right channel your pastor your father you know and you're speaking to them then at least you get a chance to get to know them and them alone and then make a decision not based on influence so I don't think this thing of courting or it's not even cutting I think it is um what's the one dating I don't believe Believers that should debt believe I shouldn't debt you're not talking to me but I believe Believers shouldn't date but Believers should Court and courtship involves courtship is done in the light it's not done in the darkness under the butcher it's done in the light when you when your father knows if you especially if your father even if your father is not a Believer your father must know what is happening in your life sister especially if you're still living under his roof did you know that if you make a vow your father can allow that vow so it's very important for you to keep in to be in the light at least if you're not so close to your father and he's not a Believer unless you can confide in your pastor and make sure you are walking in the light that I think sister I read that Testament was very good some of you need to make decisions to wipe your phone or maybe do it a factory reset and start over again praise the name of the Lord well it's almost midnight I shouldn't preach as someone uh brother brother Enoch has a testimony and so I uh I'm going to no I'm not receiving any more papers it's almost midnight I I don't know how many papers are those I just said I'm not receiving but I just but I just remembered God is gracious okay let me read this it seems this is a testament which is written this pastor read for me I do not exactly understand when I read alone so let me read it out aloud and see please Pastor read for me I think he's trying to say read my testimony this is Sister John from YMCA I think evening light bright Tabernacle I lost my sister and mother and job sorry most of most importantly that I learned in the what I learned in this meeting the devil wants me to be with their weak and falling down but I'm going to trust in God and finish it in Jesus name amen sister Joanne may God give you Grace especially through this time of loss and give you strength indeed you finish it by his grace um this is uh or Kitty Richard has a testimony I'm going to give you exactly one minute I'll count it right here so come and please no more no more writing no more writing I think that's that's more than enough for a night okay the brothers can give you the microphone bless your Saints thank God for his grace and mercies that has brought me through thank him for bringing me all this far I did not know that I was going to be here this day I thank him so much for what he has done for me there is okay spirit that was disturbing me when I come like to church and I pray it leaves me but when I go back home and I stopped meditating upon the word of God it comes back again then now when I came to this place this when I realized the trick of the devil when I stopped meditating upon the word of God for it it comes back then after I just remembered what the pastor taught us some time back last year I think you don't remember very well but you say that when there is when you have seen in you when you have sinned you cannot receive now the Holy Spirit unless you first repent you cannot get a bottle full of juice and maybe full of something like that do it so what or what and you want to pour again another thing you have to fast forward that one in the bottle out and you empty the bottom they has got to be emptying out then after you fill in something there so I learned that it was the same to us when we want to receive the Holy Spirit that he was Spirit as God first get out of us then the Holy Spirit be replaced right there so that thing really touched me and I just remembered it and it was my prayer to the Lord and he had my prayer on believed it that though it was led even if I then I only one day the Lord will hear my prayer he will do what I am expecting him to do I will receive what I'm expecting to receive I really thank God so much that he had my prayer and he took that Spirit out of me and bless the Holy Spirit right with me I thank God the Lord bless you [Applause] God bless you amen I know where to start but I want to be so brief first of all I want to thank God for brother usowozzi amen he invited me to the convention and I've been so blessed to come and put my shoulder to the wheel and to see that the convention is so a success amen now my testimony is this uh like everybody of you have been praying like for many things I will not tell you uh many things like in my life so until uh actually there's someone you preaching said an encounter with God it is on YouTube if you could find it it was it was a blessing so uh he preached a message and also brother Arthur on your Pudu he was talking about Jacob and wrestling so brother Arthur was talking about Jacob drawing a line and telling God that God you're not crossing here until you bless me so and then his sermon I'll not go to the sermon now I've been praying for a long time for many things about the ministry about let me tell you marriage you get it and then don't laugh and yeah so blessings are at work and different things challenges you know so when I came to the convention I had some like a desire in my life that God should do something as this year starts actually I told God that this year is my year yeah so before the convention I came I met brother bass booster Jose okay that was a short form as and you know he has testimonies and he talks about this and that so one of the days when we're at his home having a meal as I'm lucky to sit with the ministers you know so he started talk about I think he talked about three testimonies and you know I was so touched by these testimonies he was talking about his wife I will got married and what and of course he's like uh I don't know that call it a challenge or what but he talks about real life he brings a testimony he shows you how God has done it for him so that night I went to bed and I was like oh my God he's so you know he talks about this and the thing is so real before you so I couldn't sleep Honestly though he came here for the service very early so I was like God in this service I need you so uh the brother I don't know I've forgotten his name the brother from Kenya who preached on Morning Glory all those sermons to the brother the main speakers now brother Michael and then brother Isaac you could see that God is here you could their preaching were so intertwined that you could actually realize that God is there but now I wanted that personal experience with God now after brother brothers spoke at the home I was like I need to ask Brian I'm supposed how do you pray because you know I pray ing for the ministry praying for your life praying for the young people those that are back sleeping those from Lifeboat can tell you that we've been praying for we have this prayer together fasting so I was like he has so many strong testimonies how does he pray so I at some point I failed to ask him but now you know the when you sitting here you look at the ministers what they are doing their quotes and everything around oh my God so after the preaching uh brother suppose he came and stood here and he was calling people to pray and I don't know how what it was about but he called people to pray and I was like I need to ask him how he prays but I fear to go back because the past I asked many questions I was asking how did this happen and he was explaining so I was like I think I'll bother him but I wanted to ask him how do you pray so as we are praying everybody is praying uh I think people were in The Altar brother suppose comes and I was seated there and he tells me I have a leadership of the Holy Spirit to pray for you to pray with you and then as he was praying I was like Am I Dreaming because I wanted to ask him how do you pray and then he's telling me the Holy Spirit has come here has told me to come and pray with you now if you don't believe that God was here in this confession I don't know amen so I want to thank God that in his prophecy okay he was speaking when he was praying he was telling me that uh I think he told me that because I went back to him he told me that day what is he spoke he wasn't he it wasn't him so he was telling me God has answered you God is going to bless you and I actually believe that that was the holy spirit because I wanted to go to ask him that I want to ask him why we praise but he came and just told me God has told me to come and pray with you amen so I actually started crying I don't cry any Holy by the way honestly I don't cry but I started crying I was like I was like I'm crying so I started cleaning myself and I had to come here and sing you know so honestly I've been blessed and I I actually believe that God has answered my prayers in this convention God bless you amen so uh just before I sing a song to call to finalize their lost and found properties there's this bug I didn't open it for saturated reasons uh this if it is yours you get it with the brother lumo and then this Kenyan coin uh please if it shows come for it amen the brothers from Kenya said that it's not theirs it means I don't know that it's your sister you said that okay may the Lord bless you
