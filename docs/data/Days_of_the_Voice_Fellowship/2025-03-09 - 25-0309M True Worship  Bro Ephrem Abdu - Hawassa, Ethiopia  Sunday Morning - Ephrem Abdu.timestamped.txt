[1:15:08] Christ amen your neighbor tell them
[1:15:15] welcome amen make sure everyone is

[1:15:23] uh we are certainly thankful to the
[1:15:27] Lord for yet another
[1:15:30] opportunity to be in his
[1:15:33] house um um a few are missing out this
[1:15:39] morning about three or four
[1:15:44] that that are
[1:15:47] traveling maybe uh our recent couple
[1:15:51] sister Marl and brother Alan
[1:15:57] they made mention to me that they went
[1:15:59] to evening light bright Tabernacle to
[1:16:01] you know appreciate them for
[1:16:08] standing so perhaps they join us
[1:16:12] later but for those of you who have been
[1:16:14] able to make it this
[1:16:16] morning it's a
[1:16:18] blessing come and share
[1:16:22] together amen and uh I'm I'm happy to um
[1:16:26] also see Sister
[1:16:29] Sarah uh who is actually the mother to
[1:16:33] our brother
[1:16:36] EP
[1:16:38] and God bless you so
[1:16:40] much for coming to fellowship with us
[1:16:43] this
[1:16:45] morning uh so uh this morning we have
[1:16:48] brother
[1:16:50] ephra going to preach to
[1:16:52] us uh those of you who did not come here
[1:16:55] on Wednesday you missed out a
[1:16:58] lot uh there are a few preachers that
[1:17:01] preach and I get
[1:17:04] excited but I really was excited on on
[1:17:08] Wednesday so I just need a little
[1:17:12] more he has quite interesting
[1:17:17] Ministry he has a good grip on the
[1:17:20] word and I'm sure that his ministry will
[1:17:23] be a blessing to all of us
[1:17:28] you know there are some people who
[1:17:31] would
[1:17:32] um who would categorize
[1:17:39] ministers on the basis of their
[1:17:42] age I happen not to be among
[1:17:45] them because I understand according to
[1:17:48] the preaching of the
[1:17:51] message brother bam when he talks even
[1:17:54] about an elder
[1:17:57] says someone who is seasoned in the
[1:18:01] word and talking about spiritual
[1:18:05] maturity he's not talking about um age
[1:18:11] wise so God has always called young
[1:18:15] men and then from being young of course
[1:18:18] they grow and they grow
[1:18:21] old but it is one thing to have someone
[1:18:24] who has a gift and pre and and can
[1:18:26] preach at
[1:18:30] someone but it's another for someone to
[1:18:32] have um uh you know a Ministry and then
[1:18:36] and then focus and put their entire life
[1:18:39] to the service of the
[1:18:47] Lord the
[1:18:49] word and know what they're talking
[1:18:52] about when I came to this
[1:18:55] message that's exactly what I did
[1:18:58] started the message start everywhere I
[1:19:00] go I don't have to preach and then I say
[1:19:02] oh I'm sorry I was wrong
[1:19:07] here I should know what I'm talking
[1:19:09] about and God has been with us over the
[1:19:13] years and I believe that um uh I see
[1:19:17] brother ephra taking that
[1:19:20] trend is one of the uh few uh Brothers
[1:19:25] in Ethiopia after receiving the message
[1:19:27] that he really took it
[1:19:32] serious and he started he's been
[1:19:35] studying this
[1:19:38] message like listening to it
[1:19:41] stud and um asking questions where
[1:19:45] necessary and also ministering and going
[1:19:48] traveling with all
[1:19:50] his and when I came back from Ethiopia
[1:19:54] gave you the
[1:19:55] testimony for those who did not know
[1:19:57] this is the pastor who was hosting us
[1:20:01] there and we had a very good
[1:20:04] [Music]
[1:20:06] meetings it had a great impact on on the
[1:20:09] local people
[1:20:11] there so he has a lot of work on his
[1:20:15] shoulders a big
[1:20:17] burden and um we should really remember
[1:20:20] him and his wife in prayer
[1:20:24] that God will give them the grace that
[1:20:26] they
[1:20:27] need to fulfill the
[1:20:30] ministry amen amen so this afternoon
[1:20:35] I'll be going to brother Fred brother
[1:20:36] Fred is not here and brother uh his
[1:20:39] brother
[1:20:41] brother
[1:20:46] Jo as you know brother Fred graduated
[1:20:51] recently and so he invited us to go um
[1:20:54] and and and preach to his people to his
[1:20:58] family they Gathering all the family
[1:21:01] members father
[1:21:04] mother of course they having like a
[1:21:08] ceremony like Thanksgiving or something
[1:21:10] like that gradation Thanksgiving
[1:21:15] ceremony so um and then he told me
[1:21:18] Pastor I'm going to give you 1 hour said
[1:21:19] 1
[1:21:21] hour that's even more than we need on
[1:21:23] such a

[1:24:03] as I was planning to
[1:24:06] study I was having a lot in my
[1:24:09] mind and quickly an inspiration
[1:24:13] came where Peter and Silas was in a very
[1:24:17] bad
[1:24:20] situation they did a lot for the work of
[1:24:22] God
[1:24:25] they served him with all of
[1:24:27] their but there come a
[1:24:30] situation where they cannot fulfill
[1:24:32] their
[1:24:34] Duty both of both of their
[1:24:37] hands both of their
[1:24:40] legs tied up they could not
[1:24:44] move they could not
[1:24:46] clap but one Revelation came to
[1:24:50] them in this
[1:24:53] situation where we cannot
[1:24:55] preach where there is no one to hear
[1:24:58] us let us worship our
[1:25:01] Lord hallelujah hallelujah and when they
[1:25:05] Worship the
[1:25:07] Lord unexpected power
[1:25:10] came to release them from their
[1:25:13] situation hallelujah amen and the power
[1:25:17] will come
[1:25:18] today to release us from our
[1:25:21] problem to release us from our burden
[1:25:25] hallelujah hallelujah so you're not
[1:25:28] alone hallelujah hallelujah you're not
[1:25:32] alone so let us open our
[1:25:44] scripture Revelation chapter
[1:25:51] 5 the book we love to read
[1:25:59] from
[1:26:07] verse it says like
[1:26:12] this and when he had taken the book and
[1:26:16] the four pieces and the four 12 Elders
[1:26:19] fell down before the lamp having every
[1:26:22] one of them HS and golden vales full of
[1:26:26] odors which are the prayers of the
[1:26:29] Saints and they sang a new song saying
[1:26:32] thou are worthy to take the book and to
[1:26:35] open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:26:38] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[1:26:42] blood out of every Kindred and the
[1:26:46] tongue and the people and the nation and
[1:26:49] they has made us unto us go God's Kings
[1:26:52] and Priests and we shall reign on Earth
[1:26:55] amen
[1:27:43] God bless you
[1:27:45] you hallelujah hallelujah today I want
[1:27:48] to talk about a true worship
[1:27:55] I will say it again a true
[1:27:58] worship and you see in the
[1:28:02] Bible whenever we approach to read
[1:28:06] it we need
[1:28:09] Revelation and when you see the prophet
[1:28:11] approaching the church
[1:28:16] book The First Foundation he put
[1:28:20] on was Revelation by the spirit
[1:28:25] Hallelujah and last time as we
[1:28:28] said Revelation is not your
[1:28:32] opinion and the book in Revelation
[1:28:35] chapter 5 was
[1:28:38] closed and in Revelation chapter 10 the
[1:28:41] book was
[1:28:43] open the book was not open because we
[1:28:46] said it's
[1:28:49] open the book was not open because we
[1:28:52] believe the message
[1:28:55] the book was not open because we were
[1:28:59] baptized the book was open because we
[1:29:02] have a personal revelation by Jesus
[1:29:08] Christ Hallelujah and that's why very
[1:29:11] important to have
[1:29:15] Revelation you see in Genesis we see
[1:29:17] Abel and
[1:29:20] K you see K had to put a lot of work
[1:29:26] tried to to prove his
[1:29:32] belief K had to go to the garden and
[1:29:35] look for a beautiful things to serve the
[1:29:40] Lord you see Ken was not a bad
[1:29:43] person matter of fact the prophet says
[1:29:46] he was a
[1:29:48] Believer Kan was a True
[1:29:51] Believer but you see the difference that
[1:29:53] he had with
[1:29:56] AB pleased God by
[1:30:00] faith and that Faith brought him
[1:30:04] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah so it
[1:30:07] allowed God to identify himself in his
[1:30:12] [Applause]
[1:30:13] sacrifice Hallelujah so in Ephesians 1
[1:30:17] verse
[1:30:20] 18 it says the eyes of your
[1:30:23] understanding being
[1:30:31] en that he may know what is the hope of
[1:30:34] his
[1:30:37] calling I pray today that our
[1:30:40] understanding eyes will be
[1:30:43] open Hallelujah because K Tau he had
[1:30:48] sufficient
[1:30:51] Faith you see remember heard the same
[1:30:54] voice Abel
[1:30:57] heard every evening God was coming
[1:31:01] to every every evening Kan was attending
[1:31:05] the
[1:31:08] service he Tau the sensation and the
[1:31:12] happiness will take him
[1:31:17] far he thought hearing God's voice only
[1:31:20] will take him far
[1:31:24] it only took him somehow
[1:31:28] somewhere was unable to finish his
[1:31:32] journey so we need to have more than a
[1:31:36] voice more than
[1:31:39] sensation we need to have more than
[1:31:42] happiness that is a
[1:31:45] revelation Hallelujah Revelation is more
[1:31:48] than going to
[1:31:50] church Revelation is more than being
[1:31:52] happy
[1:31:54] Revelation is more than receiving a
[1:31:57] prophecy because Revelation is a
[1:31:59] personal
[1:32:01] reunion between you and God
[1:32:06] Alone
[1:32:07] Hallelujah so we need
[1:32:10] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:14] so that is where the church was buil
[1:32:18] on
[1:32:20] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:32:22] when we read the scripture
[1:32:26] the prophet told
[1:32:28] us in Revelation chapter
[1:32:33] 5
[1:32:36] 6168 paragraph
[1:32:41] 207 it says like
[1:32:44] this now let me just read the rest this
[1:32:48] so I can get you right quickly
[1:32:52] now and when he had taken the
[1:32:56] book and the four bces and the 20 and
[1:32:59] the four Elders fell down before the
[1:33:07] lamp uh having every one of them HS and
[1:33:10] golden vials full
[1:33:17] of it says now this is the time when
[1:33:21] everything must be worshiped
[1:33:27] I'll repeat again it says now this is a
[1:33:29] time when everything must be
[1:33:33] worship it says everything must be
[1:33:39] woried how
[1:33:42] appropriate now I don't want let us miss
[1:33:45] this now listen
[1:33:48] close when all the mysteries of the
[1:33:51] church age was finished
[1:33:56] when all the mystery of Plan of
[1:34:00] Redemption and them Seven Seals were
[1:34:03] opened right immediately after this
[1:34:07] now it is time for
[1:34:12] all everything in heaven and everything
[1:34:15] on Earth to worship
[1:34:21] God now watch what takes place listen at
[1:34:25] just uh this minute and they sang a new
[1:34:29] song saying thou are
[1:34:34] worthy the prophet is telling
[1:34:37] us after the mystery is
[1:34:41] finished we will see a lot of
[1:34:45] worship matter of fact he said this is
[1:34:48] an age of
[1:34:51] worship until you cannot differentiate
[1:34:55] between what is a true worship and the
[1:34:57] false
[1:35:01] worship because the age we live
[1:35:05] in whether they are
[1:35:07] denomination whether they are
[1:35:10] nomination it is a season of
[1:35:13] worship everything worship
[1:35:18] God so it will be very hard to
[1:35:21] differentiate
[1:35:24] where is the true
[1:35:26] worship because here we have our
[1:35:28] brothers they are worshiping
[1:35:31] also here we have brothers also
[1:35:35] worship so we will have a lot of worship
[1:35:40] everywhere and each of them will call
[1:35:42] the name of
[1:35:45] God it is very hard to
[1:35:48] differen which one is a true
[1:35:51] worship and which one is a false worship
[1:35:55] because the season we are living
[1:35:57] in everyone somehow calls
[1:36:02] God that's why in John chapter
[1:36:04] 4 verse 23 it says but the hour
[1:36:09] comes and now is when a true
[1:36:15] worshiper shall worship the father in
[1:36:18] the spirit and
[1:36:21] truth it didn't say for a true
[1:36:25] preacher it didn't say the how comes for
[1:36:28] a true
[1:36:30] preacher it say the hour comes for a
[1:36:32] good
[1:36:34] leader for a true
[1:36:38] worshiper and this true
[1:36:41] worshiper shall worship the
[1:36:44] father in spirit and truth hallelujah
[1:36:49] hallelujah so when we are talking about
[1:36:52] worship
[1:36:54] there was there was a time where God was
[1:36:57] not
[1:36:59] good because the term God means an
[1:37:02] object
[1:37:06] of so for God desired so much to be
[1:37:12] worshiped that he has an tribute to be
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:17] woried he had to create an
[1:37:21] angels so when he's worshiped
[1:37:25] now we can call him
[1:37:27] God the main reason that we are put here
[1:37:30] on
[1:37:32] Earth is to worship
[1:37:35] God hallelujah hallelujah because God
[1:37:39] wants has a desire to be
[1:37:43] God he created
[1:37:46] Adam so he can be a he can be a
[1:37:50] father and God at the same time
[1:37:54] Hallelujah so there was a
[1:37:57] time that Adam was worshiping
[1:38:01] God Adam had a perfect
[1:38:05] worship Adam had a spotl
[1:38:09] worship every day Adam worshiped
[1:38:13] God and there was a devil watching this
[1:38:19] worship the greatest battle ever fought
[1:38:22] in heaven
[1:38:25] was because the devil also wanted to be
[1:38:30] worshiped his desire was want to be like
[1:38:34] God he wants to receive
[1:38:37] worship so he Dees Angel not in Earth
[1:38:41] but in
[1:38:43] heaven to follow the
[1:38:45] devil and he deceive them and to fight
[1:38:50] God on on heaven
[1:38:53] what was the main
[1:38:55] point God wanted to be
[1:38:58] worshiped also the devil wants to be
[1:39:00] worship so the greatest battle ever
[1:39:03] fought on
[1:39:06] heaven was a
[1:39:10] worship God wanted a worship also the
[1:39:14] devil wanted a
[1:39:15] worship so when we are looking the
[1:39:17] church age
[1:39:20] book we are looking the greatest battle
[1:39:23] fought on
[1:39:26] Earth the greatest battle ever fought in
[1:39:30] heaven God throw the devil down on
[1:39:34] us but his intention was never
[1:39:39] changed he has the same intention he had
[1:39:42] in
[1:39:44] heaven so still now he's looking for
[1:39:46] people to worship
[1:39:50] him not in the name of the devil
[1:39:53] but the name of God he has a desire to
[1:39:57] pick go
[1:39:59] God but today I Take
[1:40:02] God in every false
[1:40:05] worship there are few godal
[1:40:09] people that will worship him no matter
[1:40:12] what no matter the situation happen they
[1:40:16] will call up his name they will say you
[1:40:19] are my God they will say you are my
[1:40:22] creator they will say you are my father
[1:40:26] they will say no matter what happen I
[1:40:28] will call your name I am called by your
[1:40:32] name so I'll call your
[1:40:34] name hallelujah hallelujah what is that
[1:40:38] it is a gene of God in
[1:40:41] you Hallelujah Desiring to seek God on
[1:40:48] us hallelujah so when we are looking on
[1:40:51] the church's book
[1:40:54] we see the seed was planted right in the
[1:40:57] Eden
[1:41:01] Garden the tree of life and the tree of
[1:41:05] knowledge
[1:41:06] and so these two
[1:41:09] seeds they always grow side by
[1:41:14] side and they are both religious
[1:41:19] spirits and they want they are you
[1:41:22] always find them
[1:41:24] in the
[1:41:26] church so one have a true Spirit to
[1:41:30] worship and has a false
[1:41:33] spirit so when we are looking the
[1:41:35] churches
[1:41:37] book a battle between right and
[1:41:42] wrong it is a fight between right and
[1:41:46] wrong it is a fight between true worship
[1:41:49] and false worship
[1:41:53] it is a fight between True Word of God
[1:41:55] and false of word of
[1:41:59] God hallelujah hallelujah but there time
[1:42:02] AG go
[1:42:03] time where in the Bible it tells us God
[1:42:08] will restore our
[1:42:12] worship God will restore our
[1:42:16] worship Hallelujah because we never see
[1:42:19] God leave the people alone
[1:42:23] we will never see that the people that
[1:42:26] are called by his
[1:42:27] name they might go away from him a
[1:42:30] little bit but he will still reach out
[1:42:33] to
[1:42:34] them because he is the father to them
[1:42:38] Hallelujah so in Acts chapter
[1:42:42] 15 it speaks like
[1:42:45] this acts chap
[1:42:48] 15 verse
[1:42:50] 13 it says and after they had held their
[1:42:58] peace James answered saying men and
[1:43:02] Brethren heart broken unto me Simon had
[1:43:06] declared how God at the first did visit
[1:43:09] the Gentiles to take out that same
[1:43:14] people for his
[1:43:16] name and to this agree the word of the
[1:43:19] Prophet as it was written after this I
[1:43:23] will return and will build again the
[1:43:26] Tabernacle of
[1:43:28] David which is fallen down and I will
[1:43:32] build again the runes thereof and I will
[1:43:34] set it up amen
[1:44:15] you see the Pharisees came to the
[1:44:19] Gentiles and they told them to be to
[1:44:22] obey the law of
[1:44:26] Moses by making them
[1:44:30] circumcised they try to they tried to
[1:44:33] show them the custom of
[1:44:37] Jewish telling the Gentile this is how
[1:44:39] we worship
[1:44:43] God this is a true way of worshiping
[1:44:47] God and here we see that the Tabernacle
[1:44:50] of David
[1:44:53] was promised to be
[1:44:56] restored when we talk about the
[1:44:58] Tabernacle of
[1:45:00] Moses God told to build the
[1:45:04] Tabernacle on the mount called
[1:45:08] Gideon and they went on the
[1:45:11] Wilderness and they built that
[1:45:14] Tabernacle and this
[1:45:17] Tabernacle have three
[1:45:20] coachs and there is a first C there is a
[1:45:25] second and there is a third
[1:45:28] cat and only a selected
[1:45:32] priest can enter to the holies of
[1:45:37] holies where the presence of God
[1:45:41] is and offer a true
[1:45:45] sacrifice he is only
[1:45:48] person who can worship God by them
[1:45:53] him and him
[1:45:56] alone the rest of the
[1:45:59] Believers have to stand behind the
[1:46:02] veil and that is how they worship
[1:46:07] God so they worship God that was
[1:46:12] hidden they worship God that was
[1:46:16] veiled Hallelujah it was only the high
[1:46:21] priest who can go to the
[1:46:24] second who can go to the iners
[1:46:27] of and it is only him who can sacrifice
[1:46:30] a true
[1:46:33] worship the rest they stay outside and
[1:46:37] they just watch what the high
[1:46:39] priest hallelujah
[1:46:42] hallelujah so that was a type of worship
[1:46:46] in the days of
[1:46:51] Moses theab that they
[1:46:54] have they have all the praise
[1:46:57] altar they have the sacrifice
[1:47:00] altar they have the
[1:47:02] musicians they have the
[1:47:05] elders but when they are
[1:47:08] worshiping they worship a veiled
[1:47:12] God he was never revealed to
[1:47:15] them it was only for the high
[1:47:18] priest that can worship God
[1:47:23] for them they had a
[1:47:25] limit Hallelujah that's why Paul was
[1:47:29] saying how he could
[1:47:31] wish he had this day
[1:47:36] opportunity time
[1:47:39] opportunity all the Mysteries is
[1:47:42] revealed Hallelujah Daniel wanted to see
[1:47:45] this
[1:47:47] day Paul wanted to see this
[1:47:50] day brother Bram wanted to see
[1:47:54] because it was a precious day for us
[1:47:57] where all the mystery was
[1:47:59] open and we can preach an open
[1:48:03] book by revelation of the
[1:48:05] word hallelujah but for them when they
[1:48:09] worship
[1:48:10] God it was a closed
[1:48:13] book because the book was sealed with
[1:48:17] seven and no one was worthy to open the
[1:48:21] book so the opportunities they
[1:48:24] have was to send a high
[1:48:27] priest and that high priest will worship
[1:48:31] behalf of
[1:48:32] them they have all the
[1:48:35] ARs they have chirs for them they have
[1:48:39] guitars here they have keyboards behind
[1:48:43] but all they worship they are
[1:48:45] doing was without
[1:48:48] Revelation because they were didn't have
[1:48:51] the opportunity that we had today
[1:48:54] they didn't have the opportunity we have
[1:48:57] today that's why the prophet said we are
[1:49:01] living in the Golden
[1:49:03] Age we are living in a super
[1:49:06] age where the bride has an
[1:49:09] opportunity to create a word for
[1:49:12] her Hallelujah why everything was
[1:49:16] revealed when God is
[1:49:19] revealed meaning you are also being
[1:49:21] revealed
[1:49:23] your identity is also being
[1:49:25] revealed your work is also being
[1:49:28] revealed
[1:49:31] Hallelujah we have an open book
[1:49:34] today
[1:49:36] Hallelujah so when we come to the days
[1:49:39] of
[1:49:42] Moses the worship they
[1:49:45] have was outside of the
[1:49:50] court now
[1:49:54] let us open uh First
[1:49:59] Chronicles
[1:50:07] verse are enjoying this
[1:50:12] far I'm happy that I'm here
[1:50:16] today 1 Chronicles chapter
[1:50:20] 15 verse one it
[1:50:24] like and David made him a house in the
[1:50:27] city of
[1:50:29] David and prepared a place for the Ark
[1:50:32] of God and Pitch it all a tent
[1:50:46] amen now David wanted to bring the ark
[1:50:51] back to Jerusalem
[1:50:56] and when when we see
[1:50:59] David he is a
[1:51:02] king he is a priest and he was a
[1:51:06] prophet now in the Old
[1:51:09] Testament it is impossible for one
[1:51:14] person to be both
[1:51:17] Prophet a priest and a
[1:51:21] king but God was somehow putting David
[1:51:27] there to type the bride the future
[1:51:30] coming
[1:51:32] Bri where she is a king and a
[1:51:36] priest Hallelujah when we see the
[1:51:39] Tabernacle of
[1:51:41] David it doesn't have three
[1:51:44] courts there is no first Court there is
[1:51:48] no Second Court it only had one Court
[1:51:53] and remember only the king and priest
[1:51:56] can enter in that
[1:52:00] Court David being a king and a
[1:52:04] priest didn't send anyone to go to the
[1:52:08] Tabernacle he went by himself to face
[1:52:12] God hallelujah he didn't need any
[1:52:16] permission to enter the
[1:52:18] Earth because God was typing David
[1:52:22] that this is how the future bride will
[1:52:25] be she is a king and a priest that is
[1:52:29] doming on the
[1:52:31] earth Hallelujah so when David Goes To
[1:52:35] Worship he goes alone to worship
[1:52:38] God he didn't need to advise anybody
[1:52:42] about he can have the access to worship
[1:52:46] God hallelujah
[1:52:50] hallelujah what is that
[1:52:54] typing it is God talking face to face to
[1:52:59] you coming in
[1:53:01] you the hope of glory in
[1:53:04] you that you are the king and the
[1:53:07] priest and you can worship God by
[1:53:11] yourself hallelujah
[1:53:15] amen we thank
[1:53:17] God because worshiping is not just
[1:53:20] singing
[1:53:23] worshiping is not having a good
[1:53:26] vocal worshiping is 24 hours living for
[1:53:30] God
[1:53:33] hallelujah you don't say I worship God
[1:53:36] for for 30
[1:53:39] minutes a worship
[1:53:41] is an experience of
[1:53:44] God Liv you living in you amen
[1:53:57] so when you are going to
[1:53:59] work you're worshiping God when you're
[1:54:02] going to school you're worshiping God
[1:54:05] when you're going to the kitchen you're
[1:54:06] worshiping God whatever you do you do it
[1:54:10] for the glory of God hallelujah
[1:54:13] hallelujah that is what separates you
[1:54:15] from the other
[1:54:17] people you do everything to glorify God
[1:54:23] hallelujah
[1:54:27] amen you are special
[1:54:30] people called by his
[1:54:33] name
[1:54:35] Hallelujah so uh in uh Revelation
[1:54:41] 510 he had made
[1:54:44] us King and
[1:54:47] priest and we shall r on
[1:54:50] Earth hallelujah amen here on Earth he
[1:54:53] has made her King and
[1:54:56] priest what does that mean you go
[1:54:59] straight to the Hol of
[1:55:01] H you go straight to the Shak Glory you
[1:55:06] go straight to meet
[1:55:07] God hallelujah amen you are special
[1:55:14] people hallelujah hallelujah First
[1:55:20] Chronicles Hallelujah hallelu
[1:55:34] huah 16 from verse
[1:55:40] one so they brought the Ark of God and
[1:55:44] set it in the midst of the tent that
[1:55:47] David had pitch for it and they offered
[1:55:51] a in sacrifice and peace offering before
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:10] God and when David had made an end of
[1:56:13] offering and burning sacrifice and peace
[1:56:15] offering he blessed the people in the
[1:56:18] name of the Lord
[1:56:28] and he has dealt to everyone of Israel
[1:56:30] both men and woman to everyone a loaf of
[1:56:34] bread and a good piece of Flesh and a
[1:56:36] flagon of
[1:56:49] wine and he appointed certain of L es to
[1:56:52] minister before the Ark of the Lord and
[1:56:55] to record and thank and praise the Lord
[1:56:58] of God of
[1:57:09] Israel you know it was only the high
[1:57:13] priest who could Bless the
[1:57:17] people you know it was only the high
[1:57:20] priest who can sacrifice a good
[1:57:25] but here David
[1:57:29] ising being a king and a
[1:57:33] priest he sacrifice and burning
[1:57:37] sacrifice and therefore he blessed the
[1:57:41] people hallelujah that was a type of an
[1:57:44] open
[1:57:46] book Hallelujah there is time that the
[1:57:49] book is going to be opened
[1:57:54] where we don't need another
[1:57:56] Prophet where we don't need another
[1:57:59] Revelation where we have this
[1:58:02] Revelation that this is an open
[1:58:04] book and then you can offer a Sacrifice
[1:58:08] by
[1:58:10] yourself that's why salvation is an
[1:58:12] individual
[1:58:15] of father will not be asked your mother
[1:58:19] will not be asked it is upon you you and
[1:58:22] you
[1:58:23] alone Hallelujah your father could be a
[1:58:26] preacher your mother could be a good
[1:58:29] prayer but that doesn't have nothing to
[1:58:31] do with
[1:58:32] you you are there
[1:58:34] alone David was there alone as a king
[1:58:38] and a
[1:58:39] priest typing the bride that is coming
[1:58:43] typing an open book that is coming when
[1:58:46] you have the Revelation you become the
[1:58:49] word you manifest the word
[1:58:55] Hallelujah that's why you don't need
[1:58:57] someone to H his hands on
[1:59:00] you you don't need someone to prophesy
[1:59:03] over you don't need someone to pay and
[1:59:06] to pay money and pray for
[1:59:09] you God has given you an open
[1:59:12] book
[1:59:14] Hallelujah I get confused
[1:59:17] sometimes when people speak so much of
[1:59:19] the Seven Seals
[1:59:21] [Applause]
[1:59:23] they dwell so much on the
[1:59:25] horses the white hor the black
[1:59:28] hor but the Seven Seals is the coming of
[1:59:32] the
[1:59:33] Lord hallelujah hallelujah what does
[1:59:36] that
[1:59:37] mean God is
[1:59:39] coming and he's putting on a
[1:59:42] flesh Hallelujah he's manifesting his
[1:59:45] will on
[1:59:47] Earth Hallelujah that is the coming of
[1:59:50] the world
[1:59:52] r word coming and manifesting in
[1:59:55] you
[1:59:58] Hallelujah so that's
[2:00:01] why they could say it's opening of the
[2:00:04] horse and
[2:00:07] everything for me I will say it is these
[2:00:11] Seven
[2:00:12] Seals is opening
[2:00:14] myself it is telling me my
[2:00:17] mystress it is telling me what I can do
[2:00:21] it is telling me where I came from it is
[2:00:23] telling me where I am going Hallelujah
[2:00:27] the Seven Seals it is a book that is
[2:00:30] revealing you it is telling who you are
[2:00:34] is telling your
[2:00:35] identity
[2:00:38] hallelujah amen so when we talk so much
[2:00:41] of the
[2:00:43] Rapture it is not that we we we fly on
[2:00:46] the
[2:00:48] air and someone with a big hair will
[2:00:51] come and take us
[2:00:55] for us will be
[2:00:57] crying be happy
[2:01:00] no the prophet says the Rapture is in
[2:01:05] you that means you don't expect another
[2:01:08] Rapture because the Rapture is in you
[2:01:12] and Rapture is a
[2:01:14] process Hallelujah Noah had only faith
[2:01:18] of saving his people
[2:01:23] that is the limit that he has his
[2:01:27] faith that is the faith he
[2:01:30] has to save the
[2:01:35] people that is the ability that Noah
[2:01:39] has but Enoch took
[2:01:42] over and it says I'm not saving my
[2:01:45] people
[2:01:46] only I will get rapture with
[2:01:49] him Hallelujah this message believe it's
[2:01:53] not just giving us faith is giving you
[2:01:56] rapturing
[2:01:58] Faith making you a rapturing
[2:02:01] material and that's why you eat a
[2:02:03] different
[2:02:04] food you eat a different food that makes
[2:02:08] you rapturing
[2:02:10] material Hallelujah so Noah had a faith
[2:02:13] of
[2:02:15] salvation but had a phase of rapturing
[2:02:19] faith and this message is building your
[2:02:21] faith
[2:02:25] Hallelujah I believe that I believe that
[2:02:30] hallelujah amen Rapture is taking over
[2:02:34] now hallelujah
[2:02:37] amen so we don't expect Rapture
[2:02:41] somewhere we expect Rapture in
[2:02:44] us hallelujah
[2:02:46] amen amen amen so uh we are the
[2:02:51] spiritual
[2:02:53] priest in First Peter 2
[2:02:58] ver9 it says ye are a chosen
[2:03:03] generation amen I will say you are a
[2:03:06] chosen
[2:03:07] generation you had an opportunity that
[2:03:10] Moses didn't
[2:03:11] have you had opportunity Paul didn't
[2:03:14] have you have opportunity brother
[2:03:18] Bram Hallelujah you have opportunity
[2:03:22] this is a scripture for
[2:03:23] you and this scripture is fulfilled in
[2:03:26] your
[2:03:28] day you are a chosen
[2:03:30] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[2:03:34] nation a pecular
[2:03:37] people hallelujah amen do you know
[2:03:41] Levites when we book of the first
[2:03:46] Chronicles David was talking about
[2:03:49] Levites do you know Levites have to be
[2:03:52] born in a certain
[2:03:56] way someone cannot wake up from
[2:03:59] bed today I am a
[2:04:02] l today I want to go to a Lev school
[2:04:06] they will not accept you you know the
[2:04:09] levit has to be born in a certain
[2:04:13] way that's why even the bride has to be
[2:04:16] born in a certain
[2:04:18] way she's born in a certain way
[2:04:22] she came to the message in a certain
[2:04:25] way no one told her to come to the
[2:04:28] message no Bishop convinced her to come
[2:04:31] to the message because when she was
[2:04:34] born there is a certain gen in
[2:04:37] her that will accept the
[2:04:39] word hallelujah that's why when we go
[2:04:42] out and preach We Don't Preach to
[2:04:45] convince the people we don't preach to
[2:04:48] debate the Bible we preach to reveal the
[2:04:52] word for
[2:04:53] them Hallelujah because we know the
[2:04:57] bride is born in a certain
[2:05:00] way and do you know Lis also live a
[2:05:03] certain
[2:05:04] way they live a separated
[2:05:07] life they have a separated life you
[2:05:11] don't see them
[2:05:13] everywhere they eat a special food they
[2:05:16] live a certain way and the briide live a
[2:05:19] certain way
[2:05:23] that's why the scripture say you are a
[2:05:26] royal priesthood you are a chosen
[2:05:29] generation you are a holy nation you are
[2:05:32] a popular Nation you are special people
[2:05:37] hallelujah so Levites
[2:05:39] know they are different
[2:05:42] people they don't join groups
[2:05:47] anywhere Amen to be a lite
[2:05:52] you don't join a
[2:05:54] levite you have to have from your n a
[2:05:58] blood of
[2:06:01] Levites if you don't have that
[2:06:03] Lage you are not considered to be
[2:06:08] Levites amen that's why you are message
[2:06:13] people not because someone has
[2:06:17] conv but you know your father already
[2:06:19] has made
[2:06:23] your mother your father has made you a
[2:06:24] certain way to believe the
[2:06:27] message
[2:06:30] Hallelujah that's why you could preach
[2:06:32] for an
[2:06:34] hour and some people would not
[2:06:37] understand
[2:06:37] it but there are some people who could
[2:06:41] catch it catch that Revelation and they
[2:06:45] will say this scripture is about me this
[2:06:48] scripture is not for anyone this
[2:06:50] scripture is for me
[2:06:52] why you are a certain
[2:06:56] people you came from a specific
[2:06:59] nation and this Earth is not your
[2:07:02] home hallelujah amen hallelujah
[2:07:08] hallelujah knowing
[2:07:10] this will enable us to worship a true
[2:07:15] God enable us to separate from a false
[2:07:20] worship hallelujah amen aren't you
[2:07:24] happy this is revealed to
[2:07:27] you for many they are struggling to read
[2:07:31] it for many they are hitting the why is
[2:07:34] this not revealed to
[2:07:37] me but for you it is
[2:07:41] revealed not because you have power not
[2:07:45] because you have energy not because you
[2:07:47] are
[2:07:48] smart because you are meant to believe
[2:07:53] hallelujah
[2:07:54] hallelujah so in the days of
[2:07:57] Moses there was a certain way of
[2:08:01] worship in the days of
[2:08:04] David there was a certain way
[2:08:07] of that's why the denominational
[2:08:11] people stuck so much
[2:08:14] there and they miss out the true worship
[2:08:20] today you see there is a difference
[2:08:22] between when the Pharisees CED
[2:08:27] Moses and when Jesus quoted
[2:08:31] Moses when the Pharisees was cting
[2:08:35] Moses was referring to them as a
[2:08:39] history but when Jesus was cting the the
[2:08:45] Moses it was telling them that that
[2:08:48] scripture is fulfilling this day
[2:08:52] Hallelujah but the denominational
[2:08:55] people tend to stay much on the
[2:08:59] history tend to stay much on the
[2:09:02] MS Hallelujah the God we worship is a
[2:09:07] dispensation of
[2:09:09] God
[2:09:13] hallelujah so there is a time where
[2:09:16] Moses worship was a true worship amen
[2:09:22] there is a time where David worship was
[2:09:25] a true
[2:09:27] worship but God say I cannot access
[2:09:30] people like
[2:09:32] that I cannot be here and them be
[2:09:36] here I have to be one in them I have to
[2:09:40] face to face them I have to be in them
[2:09:45] Hallelujah a true worship is in
[2:09:48] you a true worship is in you
[2:09:51] Hallelujah you don't find a true worship
[2:09:54] in the church you don't find a true
[2:09:56] worship in a
[2:09:58] se you find a true
[2:10:00] worship in you because the Seven
[2:10:05] Seals is not ringing a
[2:10:09] pastor is not revealing the prophet is
[2:10:12] not revealing a certain
[2:10:14] Church SE is a revelation of
[2:10:18] you Hallelujah and I'm here to tell you
[2:10:22] through worship shall dwell in you
[2:10:29] Hallelujah that's why Paul and they
[2:10:33] said in this
[2:10:36] situation there is no
[2:10:38] way we shall not
[2:10:41] worship my hand could be
[2:10:44] tied my leg could be tight I may not
[2:10:48] jump but I know one thing I can worship
[2:10:52] God I can call up his name I can sing
[2:10:56] God I can glorify God hallelujah am so
[2:11:01] you can worship God you can
[2:11:04] glorify
[2:11:07] Hallelujah I thank
[2:11:09] God so the
[2:11:13] Tabernacle that we
[2:11:15] see
[2:11:17] identifies the true worship in every age
[2:11:25] you see in the m in the message we
[2:11:27] see the church AG
[2:11:32] types the type of the
[2:11:34] Wilderness Hallelujah and the David
[2:11:38] Tabernacle it types the
[2:11:41] Bri the M
[2:11:43] age it was typing the church
[2:11:46] age they worshiping the
[2:11:49] Wilderness how they Worship in the
[2:11:52] hard in the days of David was typing the
[2:11:56] bride
[2:11:58] Worship in the days of
[2:12:01] Solomon type of a millenum
[2:12:05] rent so it is very important for
[2:12:08] you to identify where you
[2:12:12] belong do you belong in the
[2:12:15] churches for me I don't belong in the
[2:12:18] church for me I belong in the brid
[2:12:22] Hallelujah this is where I am I have
[2:12:26] moved from all this
[2:12:28] worship to David's
[2:12:30] worship I don't have to have three
[2:12:33] courts to
[2:12:34] worship I go straight to the holy of
[2:12:38] H I can access the spirit
[2:12:41] directly Hallelujah am and the spirit is
[2:12:44] given to you now you can worship God now
[2:12:48] you can see God hallelujah amen that's
[2:12:52] why God Moses asked Moses asked I want
[2:12:56] to see your face God told him you cannot
[2:13:00] see my face but I'll show you my back
[2:13:03] Hallelujah today today his face has
[2:13:08] been Hallelujah you could see his
[2:13:11] face Hallelujah
[2:13:14] am that's why I love the court it says
[2:13:18] you are a priesthood Nation you are
[2:13:21] separated
[2:13:22] people
[2:13:25] hallelujah amen amen I thank God for
[2:13:29] that that this
[2:13:32] message is not dwelling so much on the
[2:13:37] history it dwells so much on who you
[2:13:42] are so now it is your
[2:13:45] choice to identify your true
[2:13:49] worship in the ages that
[2:13:53] so when they when the denominational
[2:13:55] people when they
[2:13:57] worship you don't blame
[2:14:00] them you just tell them how Gods
[2:14:04] operate in a dispensational
[2:14:07] way
[2:14:09] Hallelujah I thank God for this
[2:14:12] message it will make you who you
[2:14:15] are it will give you your
[2:14:18] identic hallelujah amen
[2:14:21] so in
[2:14:23] this deceitful worship
[2:14:28] age now you could
[2:14:31] see now you could
[2:14:34] see
[2:14:36] worship Hallelujah not because of me
[2:14:40] because the message has
[2:14:42] revealed Hallelujah many people are
[2:14:47] looking when they want to meet God
[2:14:51] always this person comes in the
[2:14:55] midst he will tell them pay this
[2:14:59] amount for you your sin is very
[2:15:03] heavy so you need to pay heavy
[2:15:08] money and our people are laboring in
[2:15:11] that it is not lack of
[2:15:14] knowledge is lack of
[2:15:17] Revelation so it is upon you to the
[2:15:22] people out of her out of
[2:15:27] thein
[2:15:30] Hallelujah this is the spirit of
[2:15:35] denominationalism it will deceive you
[2:15:37] which age you are living
[2:15:40] in so you will just appear somewhere
[2:15:44] with
[2:15:46] someone telling you to do
[2:15:48] things and you end up following that
[2:15:53] man but because God loves
[2:15:55] you he has come with a
[2:15:58] message today he saying a true worship
[2:16:02] is this
[2:16:03] way true worship is this
[2:16:06] way hallelujah
[2:16:09] amen hallelujah
[2:16:11] hallelujah in Revelation
[2:16:15] 21 it
[2:16:19] says I saw a new Heaven and a new
[2:16:26] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[2:16:29] Earth were passed away and there was no
[2:16:32] more
[2:16:37] sea and I saw a holy
[2:16:41] city a New
[2:16:44] Jerusalem coming down from
[2:16:47] God out of Heaven preparing as a Bride
[2:16:51] adors for her
[2:16:54] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[2:16:59] Heaven behold the Tabernacle of God is
[2:17:03] within
[2:17:05] men he will dwell with
[2:17:08] them and they shall be his
[2:17:11] people and God himself shall be with
[2:17:16] people hallelujah amen now the
[2:17:19] Tabernacle is not in the days of
[2:17:22] Moses Tabernacle is not in the days of
[2:17:27] David

[2:53:35] redeemed it belongs to
[2:53:37] him and for his that was redeemed out of
[2:53:43] it let me tell you
[2:53:45] friends we are redeemed even now
[2:53:49] we are the
[2:53:51] redeemed we are the two
[2:53:55] worshippers amen amen and he says and
[2:53:59] look
[2:54:02] you you are a part of that
[2:54:07] ground and when he redeemed
[2:54:10] you he redeemed the Earth with the same
[2:54:14] thing and you are together again
[2:54:19] oh how much pler can it
[2:54:21] be you have to be
[2:54:23] redeemed because you are a part of
[2:54:26] it if you are not redeemed yet you have
[2:54:29] to be
[2:54:30] redeemed and if the blood didn't drop on
[2:54:34] you he's talking about the blood of
[2:54:36] Jesus you are not redeemed yet you are
[2:54:40] not yet called then he cleanses
[2:54:44] it that's the same thing he does in the
[2:54:47] fire
[2:54:49] even the blood
[2:54:50] dropped it is yet got to be cleansed by
[2:54:56] fire for a dwelling place for
[2:55:00] God but I want to say God his blood has
[2:55:02] dropped on
[2:55:05] me God already took his aboard
[2:55:10] potentially the kingdom of God is in the
[2:55:13] earth
[2:55:14] now let us not look for the kingdom of
[2:55:17] God
[2:55:19] the of God is
[2:55:20] here where the Tabernacle of God dwells
[2:55:23] in
[2:55:25] men the kingdom of God is in the earth
[2:55:29] now in the hearts of his
[2:55:32] Saints oh you ought to shout Amen
[2:55:34] to it is his
[2:55:37] attributes that he begin in the
[2:55:40] beginning now his attributes is
[2:55:44] redeemed what is he
[2:55:46] waiting to red the
[2:55:49] Earth to set his attributes in
[2:55:53] it to fulfill exactly his predestinated
[2:55:58] [Music]
[2:56:02] plan can you say
[2:56:05] amen that's why we don't preach to
[2:56:07] convince
[2:56:10] anyone we preach only to reveal
[2:56:15] you the word reveals Who You Are
[2:56:20] Levites are not
[2:56:22] made they are
[2:56:24] born we are
[2:56:26] royalty we are
[2:56:28] priests offering spiritual
[2:56:32] sacrifices we are revealed in this
[2:56:35] hour the only thing that is remaining is
[2:56:39] redeem the
[2:56:40] Earth but we are redeemed I am redeemed
[2:56:44] if you redeemed just say I am
[2:56:46] redeemed in that in that land of the
[2:56:50] redeemed in that place no Graves no
[2:56:55] tear no more
[2:56:57] Bloodshed no
[2:56:59] teardrops no no more
[2:57:01] walls no more clouds of
[2:57:06] winter it won lay no more on
[2:57:10] it sun will will be
[2:57:13] there there will be no
[2:57:16] desert I'm talking about the
[2:57:19] Millennium but everything that we have
[2:57:21] talked about we potentially the the
[2:57:25] receivers of right
[2:57:27] now let us
[2:57:29] pray Lord there's a lot more we can talk
[2:57:32] about
[2:57:35] this we are looking
[2:57:38] forward to that time when we are going
[2:57:42] to be in that place
[2:57:47] [Music]
[2:57:50] but even now
[2:57:51] Lord we can sing a new
[2:57:54] song because we are the
[2:57:56] redeemed of the
[2:57:59] lord we know who we are
[2:58:02] now by the opening of the
[2:58:05] SE it has revealed who we
[2:58:09] are it has revealed that we are not
[2:58:12] among those that are getting lost in
[2:58:14] Satan's Aiden
[2:58:20] but we are among those of the
[2:58:23] redeemed we are the
[2:58:28] redeemed we are rejoicing in our
[2:58:31] hearts not because we feel
[2:58:34] it but because it is revealed
[2:58:37] us because we know that none of your own
[2:58:40] can be
[2:58:44] lostone
[2:58:46] of father
[2:58:49] in a congregation like
[2:58:53] this I know there might be someone
[2:58:57] Lord that has had questions in their
[2:59:01] heart but trouble Lord
[2:59:04] through but may you impress it upon
[2:59:06] their hearts I
[2:59:08] pray for them to know that they cannot
[2:59:10] be
[2:59:11] lost and that they have no choice but to
[2:59:14] respond to the revealed word of their
[2:59:18] for that se they must
[2:59:20] respond to that word no matter where
[2:59:23] they are no matter who they are you will
[2:59:27] find them you will call them you will
[2:59:29] establish them in the present truth and
[2:59:32] Lord we are among those that you have
[2:59:36] called and we so much appreciate you
[2:59:39] Lord and since we came in this
[2:59:42] place we realize we are
[2:59:46] redeemed and we have a new to
[2:59:49] sing a new song to
[2:59:52] sing nothing of this
[2:59:54] world can make us worry or make us go
[2:59:58] away of your
[3:00:00] grace and nothing of this world can
[3:00:05] satisfy it's only in you we are
[3:00:09] safe we are the true
[3:00:12] worshippers that would worship you in
[3:00:14] spirit and
[3:00:16] in that woman at the
[3:00:19] she receed that
[3:00:21] Revelation that it was not at a certain
[3:00:24] Mountain certain set of doctrines and
[3:00:30] teachs it was the person of
[3:00:32] Christ and she worship
[3:00:36] truly and Lord here we
[3:00:38] are we are the true
[3:00:40] worshipers not by might or by strength
[3:00:44] but by your grace we are grateful to the
[3:00:47] servant of God
[3:00:49] bless him I pray anoint him give him
[3:00:53] more understanding and revelation of
[3:00:55] your whenever he stands you will be a
[3:00:59] blessing to your people I thank you for
[3:01:01] these people Lord that have come
[3:01:03] to in this place let your blessings rest
[3:01:07] upon them Father and Grant every
[3:01:10] need in their hearts Lord in the name of
[3:01:14] Jesus Christ amen
[3:01:19] amen you may be
[3:01:21] seated amen God bless you
[3:01:25] Sister is Brother John
[3:01:29] here sister Esther is Brother John here
[3:01:34] no okay the the last Sunday Sunday U
[3:01:39] this is just a testimony before you
[3:01:42] go um sister Esther you were not around
[3:01:45] you were sick
[3:01:46] then I you give the
[3:01:49] testimony we thank God for your
[3:01:51] healing amen and so um sister Esther met
[3:01:57] somebody
[3:02:00] gentle and this man was
[3:02:04] um
[3:02:06] um Pentecost is a Pentecostal
[3:02:09] there and one of the churches in
[3:02:12] m and so um I think he had gone at
[3:02:19] shop to buy certain
[3:02:22] things and and then sister
[3:02:25] Esther started
[3:02:29] evangelizing inv and then invited him to
[3:02:32] church also told him about the message
[3:02:35] the
[3:02:36] leadership and um also I think he added
[3:02:40] him on a Channel of a certain a brother
[3:02:42] who has a WhatsApp Channel where they
[3:02:44] usually share message
[3:02:49] so this man was always listening to
[3:02:52] these
[3:02:53] things and uh one time of course they
[3:02:56] lost when he left they left they were
[3:02:58] not in
[3:03:01] touch and then she went um so he went
[3:03:04] back to his
[3:03:06] church and now after a while of
[3:03:10] listening to the
[3:03:11] messages ah he started talking about
[3:03:16] it for get to his
[3:03:18] pastors get to the people in the
[3:03:21] church so the
[3:03:23] pastor called him to
[3:03:25] order he said this we don't believe
[3:03:28] this stop spreading it
[3:03:31] around and they they really took a
[3:03:33] problem with
[3:03:34] him and uh you
[3:03:37] know you know he felt out of
[3:03:40] place but these things are the scripture
[3:03:43] the
[3:03:44] Bible we talk about women preachers it
[3:03:46] is in the Bible
[3:03:48] you talk about baptism in the name of
[3:03:50] the Lord Jesus Christ it is in the Bible
[3:03:53] so why are you getting
[3:03:55] offended no no no it's not the do of our
[3:03:58] church and you should not preach these
[3:04:01] things and uh so the brother F out of
[3:04:05] place I remember who connected me to
[3:04:07] these things by the way it was that
[3:04:10] woman
[3:04:11] called so he looked he told me I looked
[3:04:13] for her
[3:04:15] number and I finally found it
[3:04:18] and then last Sunday she called him he
[3:04:22] called
[3:04:23] her and told her I'd like to go to your
[3:04:27] church with you this
[3:04:29] morning she said ah sorry I'm sick I'm
[3:04:32] at home I'm not this Sunday no but you
[3:04:35] direct me I'll
[3:04:37] go so sister called me in the morning
[3:04:40] gave me the contact and we directed him
[3:04:44] so he came and um he he said he
[3:04:48] thoroughly enjoyed
[3:04:51] the and uh I found him okay I was
[3:04:55] meeting a few people so for almost 30
[3:05:00] minutes the man waited and the whole
[3:05:03] time he was with Brother
[3:05:05] Martin and he was telling him this
[3:05:07] testimonies was
[3:05:09] excited and um and I found him still
[3:05:12] waiting he said I want I waited to tell
[3:05:14] you this testimony
[3:05:17] now I have you even my entire
[3:05:21] family I want them I want to bring them
[3:05:24] but I could not come without knowing the
[3:05:27] place first I wanted to come and see the
[3:05:30] place and hear what you preaching then I
[3:05:33] can also bring my entire family so
[3:05:37] imagine so sister
[3:05:38] Esther we have to follow up that
[3:05:42] leadership you know I tell you what
[3:05:44] friends you all are evangelists
[3:05:48] you know God has his seed
[3:05:50] somewhere and his seed can never be
[3:05:53] lost it's not the trying and preaching
[3:05:56] and
[3:05:58] cutting you know that's why this message
[3:06:01] is not a Hellfire
[3:06:03] message the message we are
[3:06:05] preaching is not a Hellfire
[3:06:08] message let me emphasize that
[3:06:11] again the end time message is not a
[3:06:15] Hellfire message
[3:06:19] I know I
[3:06:20] had I had in one of the sermons of
[3:06:25] uh you know what is his
[3:06:30] name he preached and said repent or go
[3:06:32] to
[3:06:35] hell that's okay it belongs to some
[3:06:38] people we preach it but not to
[3:06:44] beli you get a point
[3:06:47] let me clarify to the
[3:06:50] Believers I don't even need to threaten
[3:06:52] you with
[3:06:54] hell hell is not your
[3:07:00] portion there's not no scripture in the
[3:07:02] Bible that says you are going to
[3:07:10] hell okay if you are here because you
[3:07:13] are fearing to go to hell you are in the
[3:07:16] wrong place
[3:07:19] the people we are preaching to we are
[3:07:21] not saving them from
[3:07:26] hell what we are doing I'll tell you
[3:07:28] what we are
[3:07:30] doing we are
[3:07:33] preaching a message that is reminding
[3:07:37] them who they
[3:07:40] are now when they realize who they
[3:07:43] are they begin to even shed off
[3:07:49] a few things that they realize they
[3:07:51] don't need
[3:07:53] any because they have found out who they
[3:07:56] truly
[3:07:59] are a
[3:08:01] prince is not a
[3:08:03] prince because you've chosen them to be
[3:08:05] a
[3:08:06] prince is that amen a prince is a prince
[3:08:11] by
[3:08:13] birth a prince before he is born
[3:08:17] is a
[3:08:19] prince but say if a prince is
[3:08:22] born and then he's taken into
[3:08:25] slavery if he knows he's a
[3:08:27] prince he will continue behaving as
[3:08:30] well but if he does not know and he's
[3:08:34] told you mean I'm a
[3:08:37] prince from that day you will stop
[3:08:40] dressing like the
[3:08:41] other he will stop behaving like because
[3:08:45] he has realized who he is we were born
[3:08:48] in all these
[3:08:49] denominations some of you thought you
[3:08:51] were catholic others thought you were
[3:08:53] angc others thought you P but then you
[3:08:57] had the ego
[3:08:59] scream mother ego screaming calling out
[3:09:01] your
[3:09:02] name and then you're like ah that voice
[3:09:06] is
[3:09:07] familiar and now the prophet says you
[3:09:11] know if the
[3:09:12] bride receives the
[3:09:15] revelation of who she truly is
[3:09:18] she will not be
[3:09:20] defeated she will be an
[3:09:23] invisible if she knows who she is and
[3:09:27] who she stands for so every preaching we
[3:09:30] come here to do is to help you to
[3:09:33] understand who you
[3:09:34] are and who what you stand for that's
[3:09:38] what it's all
[3:09:39] about and I'm so glad that every time I
[3:09:42] sit under the preaching of the
[3:09:44] word I realize more about
[3:09:49] the revelation of Jesus
[3:09:53] Christ brings you the revelation of
[3:09:58] yourself because you are a part
[3:10:03] of the leg is a part of
[3:10:07] me so the leg is
[3:10:10] me you are a part of
[3:10:13] Christ so you are him
[3:10:17] amen that's why the Bible calls you the
[3:10:19] salt of the
[3:10:21] earth the Bible calls you you you the
[3:10:26] light of the
[3:10:28] world but Jesus is the light of the
[3:10:31] world but you are the light of the world
[3:10:34] you are the Epistles written
[3:10:36] Epistles read of all men so you are the
[3:10:39] word of God Jesus is the word of God so
[3:10:43] whatever he is you
[3:10:45] are amen so whenever you that's why we
[3:10:48] by the way we should feed on the
[3:10:50] word we should read the
[3:10:52] messages we should we should read the
[3:10:55] Bible and we should pray because these
[3:10:58] things will help us to understand who we
[3:11:02] are so the summon this morning has been
[3:11:05] one of our kind to remind us who we
[3:11:08] are we are true
[3:11:11] worshipers amen I'm a true
[3:11:15] worshiper so as we dismiss
[3:11:18] I'd like to encourage
[3:11:19] you to some of you have relaxed in
[3:11:26] prayer I believe that a Believer should
[3:11:29] always be communing with
[3:11:34] God we should always be in
[3:11:37] prayer know Jesus do you know that Jesus
[3:11:39] was a man of
[3:11:41] prayer you're not answering me that's
[3:11:45] the truth he was always was a man of
[3:11:49] prayer
[3:11:50] God so we had a prayer
[3:11:54] group um I don't know what's happening
[3:11:57] with them
[3:11:58] days but I pray that God gives you a
[3:12:02] Revival because without prayer a church
[3:12:05] which has no prayer will go
[3:12:09] nowhere and if you want to join that
[3:12:12] prayer
[3:12:14] group please see these brothers
[3:12:18] Brothers see Brother
[3:12:19] Martin and brother Dan or
[3:12:23] Jo sisters you can see I think it is
[3:12:26] Sister Ruth I
[3:12:30] Ruth and those of you others who I think
[3:12:33] Sister Mary is
[3:12:34] there and then let them put you on that
[3:12:36] group the ones who don't want to
[3:12:39] pray talk to them to be
[3:12:44] removed and then the ones who want so
[3:12:47] that the fire can
[3:12:49] continue see I believe prayer is a
[3:12:53] burden which you receive from the
[3:12:55] Lord and some have it others
[3:12:58] don't but the ones who do have it you
[3:13:02] should always keep the fire
[3:13:05] going as much as I believe each of us
[3:13:08] must be at our place of
[3:13:11] prayer each of us we must be men and
[3:13:15] women of
[3:13:18] us let us not relax in pray let us pray
[3:13:21] for the ministry there's a lot of needs
[3:13:24] let us pray for the ministers for the
[3:13:27] church for
[3:13:29] families and the Lord will bless you so
[3:13:32] brother ephra God bless you so
[3:13:34] much we would like to pray for him that
