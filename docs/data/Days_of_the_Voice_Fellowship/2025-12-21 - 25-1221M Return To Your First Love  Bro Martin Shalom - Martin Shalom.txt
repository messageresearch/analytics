This morning, &gt;&gt; uh I want to I'm going to preach about uh I call my text return. I remember I'd never preached this before, but uh I had them in kind of uh I had uh several parts of it. And this morning I'm going to preach uh on return to your first love. Blessed be the name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just pray for me. And the Lord will uh speak to you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And where we have read here, &gt;&gt; uh, Matthew is telling us something in Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; If you read, uh, there is several warning in the scripture. Amen. The Bible says in vers three that and as he sat upon the mount of olive, the disciple came unto him privately saying that tell us when shall uh these things be and what shall be the sign of the coming and of the end of the world. And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Take heed that no man deceive you." For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many. And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, and see that you be not troubled, for all things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. And there shall be famine and pestilence and earthquake in diverse places. And all these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nation for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall arise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall works cold. Praise be to God. We are seeing the disciples here. They were concerned and they wanted to know the signs of the coming of the Lord. Praise be to God. And we have read in this scripture. Very the Lord speaking about many things how nation rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom. He talks of earthquaking, diverse, wars and rumors of wars. Praise be TO GOD. BUT HERE IT tells us that when we see all these things, it is just the beginning of sorrow. The end is yet is not yet. Praise be to God. Amen. We believe, how many believes that we're in the end time? Yes, we are living in the end time and we are seeing these very things going on. BUT JESUS TOLD US WHEN HE HEARS OF WARS and rumors of wars and perplexity in nature. Amen. Talk of the earthquakes, the tornados, the typhoons and ALL THOSE THINGS. YOU SAY that when you SEE THOSE THINGS IS JUST the beginning of sorrow. The end is not yet. Nation rise AGAINST NATION, kingdom against kingdom. Praise be to God. Amen. And many times those are the things we are looking at only those are the signs of the end. &gt;&gt; AND WE THINK THAT THOSE are the in 12. Amen. It says, "Because iniquity shall abound, the love of men shall work. BUT HE THAT SHALL ENDURE unto the end, the same shall be saved." Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE INIQUITY SHALL ABOUND WE LIVING IN THE TIME I believe it's like the time OF JOB BECAUSE SOMEWHERE IN JOB SAY that I made covenant with my EYES not to see EVIL THINGS. I THINK DURING JOB'S DAYS IT was terrible. PRAISE BE TO GOD. BUT WE are the people who HAVE COME TO THE END OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE SEEN THE END of the world. Praise be to God. WE ARE SEEING THE FALSE PROPHET. THEY'RE RISING EVERY DAY GIVING FALSE PROPHECY. PRAISE BE TO GOD. We are the people living IN THE TIME WHERE WE HAVE PROPHETS who sees when it's going to rain. THEY FIRST SEE THE CLOUDS AND THEY PROPHESY. THUS SAYS THE LORD. It's going to rain. And then it failed to rain. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; False prophets. They're all over the uh the social media. THEY ARE DOING THINGS THAT you can't even imagine. Praise be TO GOD. THEY ARE MAKING MERCHANDISE OUT OF PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; There is one I saw and this was this one was kicking women this year prophets. The Bible wonders. Praise be to God. Amen. But we KNOW THAT AMIDST ALL THIS CONFUSION, there is A VOICE OF GOD. AMEN. WHEN GOD SENT MOSES TO EGYPT, MOSES HAD THUS SAYS THE LORD. THAT'S WHAT MADE DIFFERENCE. HE MET GOD IN THE BURNING BUSH. GOD COMMISSIONED HIM TO GO WITH A MESSAGE OF LIBERATION, liberate nation of Israel. Praise be to God. BUT EVEN IN EGYPT ALSO, THEY ALSO HAD PROPHETS. AND THEIR STICK OR THEIR STAFF &gt;&gt; ALSO HAD VOICE BEHIND behind Moses's stuff. IT HAD A MESSAGE. LET MY PEOPLE go behind false prophet STUFF ALSO. YOU ARE GOING NOWHERE. Praise be to God. Amen. But this morning, I want to talk about return to your first life. We can talk about this until Jesus comes. Amen. All of us, we know what love is. Praise be to God. AND ALL OF US HAVE DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION of love. But by the eye of the prophet, the message OF THE HOUR, HERE comes a prophet and gives us definition of LOVE AND THE types of love and tells us there IS A LOVE and love. IT tells us the love of agap is GODLY LOVE THAT WHICH IS UNCONDITION. Praise be to God. Amen. And then after those the ages praise be to God. BUT THE LOVE I'M talking about this morning is the love of God. RETURNING TO THAT FIRST LOVE YOU HAD. AMEN. And I can refer THAT LOVE YOU HAD WHEN you had just believed. THAT FERVENT DESIRE TO PLEASE GOD. And in church ages, WE ARE SEEING GOD REBUKING the church of Ephesus, telling them to return TO THE FIRST LAND. PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let's read this scripture in Revelation chapter. I I believe it's chapter 2. Uh yeah, we're reading from chapter 2 to chapter 2 verse one to uh vers six. It says, "Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus, write these things, says he that hold the seven star in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlestick. I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou cannot bear them which are evil, and thou hast tried them which say they are apostle and are not, and has found them liars, and has borne, and has patience. And for my name's sake thou labored, and has not fainted. Nevertheless, I have somewhat AGAINST THEE, BECAUSE THOU HAS LOVED THY FIRST LOVE. This is what I'm talking about here. &gt;&gt; Remember there are far FROM WHEN THOU HAVE FALLEN and repent and do the works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of uh his place, except thou repent. And this thou hast that thou hastest the deed of Nicolatans which I also had. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in this scripture, God is speaking to the church of Ephesus AND IS RECOGNIZING HOW they are patient, how they never bear those who are evil. BUT HE TOLD THEM TO return to their fast. One time uh I remember I preached a sermon drifting without knowing. Praise be to God. Yeah, YOU CAN DRIFT WITHOUT realizing that you've been drifting because remember BACKSLIDING DOES NOT JUST HAPPEN at once. No, it is gradual. Praise be TO GOD. WHEN THE DEVIL COMES TO YOU, HE DOES NOT JUST COME AND KNOCK YOU. HE MUST COME with a bait. Praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; This very week I was talking to one of my sister's daughters. They were telling me that giving me description of Satan how he has ready eyes with horns with long teeth. And I told them no that's not true. I TOLD THEM THE DEVIL is one of the most beautiful creature. So we went to the scripture and we read about Lucifer how he was beautiful and they were like what? Praise be to God. Then I told them if the DEVIL WAS UGLY, NOBODY WOULD have loved the devil. But he disguise in beauty to entice people. Amen. I NEVER STOPPED THERE BECAUSE I KNOW THEY LOVE PAINTING THEMSELVES so much. So I went, we went and read about Jezebel and the end of Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Praise be TO GOD. SO THE devil uses beauty. He's a HANDSOME GUY. HE'S A beautiful guy. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. BECAUSE JUST IMAGINE IF THE GUY COMES with a horn maybe seven heads like the way the Bible describe him that dragon seven horns 10 everybody will run away BUT THIS GUY WAS HANDSOME AND UP TODAY THIS GUY IS IN BEAUTY THAT'S WHY WOMEN ARE IN TROUBLE OH, IN THE WORLD THERE THEY PAID THEMSELVES UNTIL they go astray themselves. DO YOU KNOW YOUR daughter like for those in the world NOW YOUR DAUGHTER CAN WALK UPON HER SOUL AND YOU BYPASS HER WITHOUT KNOWING THAT SHE'S YOUR daughter that is the generation we are in he will put artificial eyeball artificial teeth, artificial nails. She will bypass you unknowingly. Praise be to God. You find somebody with maybe 60 kg alone of maybe the bombs, things like that. have undressed them. &gt;&gt; You will see a very very portable girl. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; So now here God is rebuking the EphesS church and THE CHURCH WHICH CHRIST IS TAKING. THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS TO RESTORE US BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CHURCH, ORIGINAL POWER, ORIGINAL ANOINTING, ORIGINAL SEAL. YES, SIR. WHEN I'M SAVED, THE BRIDE WILL WRITE ANOTHER BOOK OF ACTS WHERE SONS AND FOLLOWING THE CHURCH AND SHINE, HOLINESS and purity. YES SIR. PRAISE BE TO GOD. SO THIS MESSAGE IS TO TAKE US BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FAITH and the prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. THIS MESSAGE IS NOT TO MAKE US other creatures, not to make us a superman. NO SIR, BUT TO RESTORE US BACK OUR ORIGINAL STATE. blow our MIND FOR US TO KNOW BYPASS OUR THEOPHONY WHICH HAS BEEN CONNECTING US TO THE PRAISE BE TO GOD WHEN WE WERE BORN ON EARTH WE WERE DISCONNECTED from our THEOPHONY AND WHEN WE CAME ON EARTH WE LIVE LIKE ANY OTHER TALK LIKE ANY OTHER PEOPLE, BEHAVE LIKE ANY OTHER PEOPLE. PRAISE BE TO GOD. I WAS IN A PENTECOSTAL, &gt;&gt; but I not KNOW ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN Catholicism and Pentecostal. PRAISE THE LORD. YOU PRAY IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, the son, and the holy. You baptize in the same name. THEY GIVE YOU BAPTISM CERTIFICATE. No difference. And we also used to laugh at them. We also used to laugh at them. We were always they were our cousins. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when we encounter the message, it is the message OF THE HOUR. AMEN. WHICH SHOWED US THAT WE ARE THE SONS OF GOD, THAT WE as good as God, LIVE ABOVE SIN. CAN BE CHRISTIAN AND BE RIGHT HERE, RIGHTEOUS MAN AND WOMAN, RIGHTEOUS SONS and daughters. Praise be to God. Amen. AMEN. BUT AS TIME GOES ON, THIS IS HOW THE DEVIL OPERATES.

YOU can't wake UP IN THE MORNING AND PUT ON YOUR ELEMENT AND THEN YOUR BELT AND THE SHOES AND SAY I HAVE PUT ON the whole armor. shall sincerely research about you. But what am I TRYING TO SAY? ALL THESE THINGS THEY ARE SPIRITUAL. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY CAN NO MAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE things of God. God because God IS A SPIRIT WHO WORSHIP HIM. THEY MUST WORSHIP EACH OTHER. AND THE TRUTH WHICH IS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A WORSHIPPER? &gt;&gt; HOW DO you worship? &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. SO THAT'S WHAT THE DEVIL DOES.

I'm here to tell you, brothers, What are those things that you used to do? You used to come 30 minutes before the service and then you come 3 hours. You are very comfortable. I'm here TO TELL YOU BROTHER NEVER LET YOUR CONVICTION DIE. NEVER LET YOUR CONVICTION DIE. The moment YOU LET YOUR CONVICTION DIE, YOU ARE GONE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU REACH A POINT WHERE YOU STRAY AND YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WHERE YOU SAY PRAYERS AND YOU ARE COMFORTABLE, YOU NO LONGER PRAY, you say. Lord you also know by that it's even late coming to mid. Thank you father was full of a lot but tomorrow will be better in JESUS NAME. ONE man say uh I'm forgetting the other word &gt;&gt; uh leave alone that one it says &gt;&gt; is something like I don't know have something I have time Christian can become a full-time devil Christian cannot overcome a fulltime DEVIL BROTHER. LET ME TELL YOU, EVEN WHEN YOU DEFEAT THE devil today, he just leaves you for A SEASON. WHEN JESUS WAS ATTEMPTED BY THE DEVIL, THE BIBLE SAYS THE DEVIL LEFT JESUS FOR A SEASON. HE goes back into the dark gym. HE GOES BACK INTO THE SPY INTELLIGENCE OF the darkness. What can I add? REMEMBER WE IN THE BATTLE THE STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE INTELLIGENCE. WHEN INTELLIGENCE FAIL DOESN'T MATTER HOW HOW LARGE ARMY YOU HAVE. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AMERICA HAS CIA CIA. &gt;&gt; THEY OPERATE OUTSIDE AMERICAN SPYING FOR AMERICA. THEY HAVE THE FBI FBI &gt;&gt; THAT IS there among others. PRAISE BE TO GOD. WHY &gt;&gt; TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ARMY? So when you have loose intelligence, you already defeated me and physical things, they die, spiritual things. We are LIVING THE END TIME WITH THE PROPHET TELLS MILLIONS OF DEMONS ARE RELEASED IN THIS GENERATION. But believers they there's no brother is better than you think return to YOUR FIRST LOVE. JESUS SAID AS WAS IN HIS FIRST COMING his second coming EVENT IN HIS FIRST COMING THE SAME THING IS happening now. Praise be to God. Be connected to the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE IF NOT THE COMING OF THE LORD HE'S GOING TO FALL ON YOU UNAWARE. You will be amongst us. The foolish virgin. Are you in the church triumphant? Are you IN THE CHURCH TRIUMPHANT? ARE YOU IN THE savior's bride? HAVE YOU BEEN BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY? Or you are not sure? You can't be you cannot be sure for 2 3 4 5 10 years. It's impossible. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot. &gt;&gt; You have to be sure. Praise be to God. You must be sure. And when this thing is preached, people think there's another way. Brother, sister, there's no ANY OTHER WAY of giving birth. There is no other way. GIVING BIRTH HAS THE SAME PROCEDURE. You can't tell us I want children and you don't want to get married or you don't want to marry. Are you going to kidnap? Is that what is in your plan? What are you trying to say? This is what I'm trying to say. UNLESS that sit in you is quickened by the Holy Ghost. You are not even a worshshiper. YOU HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED. AND YOU ARE comfortable waiting for ranch. The magnet, the law of magnetism, &gt;&gt; it only attracts the things which has the ELEMENT OF WHICH HAS MAGNET AND JESUS IS A MEGA MAGNET. And when you LOOK AT THE PROCESS OF THE RAPTURE, THE FINAL STAGE of the RAPTURE tells us we are going to meet him in the air. THERE MUST BE A FORCE IN YOU WHICH is going TO VIOLATE THE LAW OF GRAVITY. YES SIR. AND THAT LAW IS CALLED THE HOLY GHOST. Praise be TO GOD. YOU CANNOT WALK ON WATER. BUT WHEN YOU'RE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, you can walk on water BECAUSE THE BIBLE TELLS THAT IN THE BEGINNING THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. AND JESUS WHEN HE WAS ON EARTH, HE WALKED ON WATER, THE DISCIPLES SAW HIM WALKING ON WATER. HALLELUJAH. WHEN THEY WERE SCARED AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A GHOST, Peter said, "If you are the Lord, be to walk." IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU ARE JESUS, JUDGE ME. I ALSO WALK on water. Praise be to God. AND JESUS told him, "It's okay. Come on, brother." And the brother enjoy the revival was there. BUT WHEN WHEN HE MOVED HIS EYES FROM JESUS, HE started to sing. BUT EVEN THOUGH HE SANK AND Jesus held his hand, &gt;&gt; he remained a MIGHTY MAN. &gt;&gt; THOUGH I SANK, BUT AT LEAST I WALKED some moment. PRAISE BE TO GOD. THAT SINKING DOESN'T mean I never walked ON WATER. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY RIGHTEOUS MAN SEVEN TIMES RISE AGAIN. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY TIME YOU HOW MANY TIME YOU ARE BURIED IN SIN. ARE YOU WILLING TO GO? ARE YOU WILLING TO RUN? ARE YOU WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD? PRAISE BE TO GOD IN THE ARMY IN THE WAR. &gt;&gt; Nobody can say for me they will not even give shoot me even a bullet. Yes, there are nations that I will not speak about. I think they had that nature of army. &gt;&gt; They can they can promote you. Promote you when you have never even hit a bullet. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; NOT JESUS. &gt;&gt; He's a RIGHTEOUS JUDGE. HE'S A FAIR GOD. HAS CHANCES TO GIVE US THE SAME BULLET OF OF THAT BULLET IS FAITH IN THE NAME OF JESUS. AMEN. AND HE SEND US TO THE FIELD. HE SEND US TO THE BATTLE. EVEN WHEN WE ARE BEATEN, HE STILL COMES AND GIVES US A HEART. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND THAT'S WHY HE SAY THE ONE WHO OVERCOMES &gt;&gt; IS THE ONE THAT WILL SIT with me. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many will. It is sin that drives that dries you up. LOSES THAT LIFE OF CHRIST. That's why the Bible tells you sh from any appearance of evil. I always tell the devil is like a hawker. In fact, the devil is a hawker, the advanced one. and is a mobile. He moves with the LASTATION and designs them in a very package. He said no this is the last they say it's the last the pastor will tell you sister I think that is your last thing after the devil will tell you how pastor is really doing you a disservice pastor you don't know how I feel whenever I look at that guy when I just think about his my heart leaps for joy. When I hear his voice, &gt;&gt; I see lightning and thus even when the sky is clear, pastor, you can't just leave this. My daughters always tell me, my sister's daughters is not there for more than 10 years. You don't understand not say that last. You see that guy but there's something he does and you understand indeed you are under spell and that is the devil spell brother when YOU ARE HERE LAST IS LAST YOU DON'T HAVE any other NAME LIE IS LIE WE WILL NOT EVEN SAY THAT HE'S TWISTED WHEN YOU LIE, YOU ARE A LIAR. When you steal, &gt;&gt; don't say no. You see, I picked some &gt;&gt; you have stolen. &gt;&gt; I not come to tell brother I picked your phone the other day. FAIL ME. I WAS overtaken and I stole your phone. Please forgive me. That is repentance. Praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the devil is a HAWKER HIMSELF. THAT'S WHY LET US LOOK AT THE CROSS. THE BIBLE TELLS US LET US LAY ASIDE EVERY WAY. LET US EASILY set us. Not only that, let us look unto Jesus who is the author. He's the auth of that faith. YOU BELIEVE AUTHOR OF THE SALVATION AUTHOR OF SALVATION Jesus Christ. The Bible tells us LET US LOOK TO HIM. THE MOMENT YOU TURN YOUR EYES THIS AND YOU last up to the devil's merchandise, the guy will follow you. He will follow you until you go to the grave. This is not love. This is love. This is normal. It's okay even SLEEP WITH THAT PERSON. HOW WILL YOU know more brother? If you are not sure whether you are normal, come for prayers. Before ministers here remove their hands from you, you already prove that you are more than Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. SO THAT'S HOW THE DEVIL IS. BUT NOW WE living in the TIME sin is everywhere. EVERY SIDE YOU LOOK UNTIL EVEN THE CHILDREN OF God they think it is no MORE THAT IT IS NOT KNOWN. It's not known Christian they ARE CHRISTIAN TIME MEMORIAL until today and God has a reason. Do you think Mary only Mary was the only virgin? I don't think so. No sir. &gt;&gt; There are many virgins. because I call it the Jewish law. A girl was it was abomination. Defile yourself. That's why even Joseph planned to divorce Mary. You see, but God had a reason. Mary had a purpose and you have a purpose. Praise be to God. But I'm in this message. The message this is church 86. The city was rich and owned by the wealth. It was full of culture. Science bounded. day which is rich, the beautiful worship and formal but cold and dead. YOU ENTER IN A CHURCH AND IT'S LIKE this light changing They had smoke blowers. Blessed in the name of VERY BEAUTIFUL WITH A NICE CHOIR dressing so by that information Catholic choirs they don't put on mini skirts and they have different singers this group sings in they call it tener Look at the adventist. No one is pure. But the people in the congregation, some of them are crossing daily WhatsApp, others on WhatsApp. Dead worship. Dead worship. Culture and education have taken the place of this of spirit given word and faith has been has been uh supered by science. THAT MAN IS VICTIM OF MATERIALISM and from out of the CHAOS OF THE MODERN SCIENCE SCIENTIFIC that's where we are LIVING IN OF CULT AND SCIENCE AND EDUCATION and all this modern stuff that's why he says iniquity shall abide Praise be to God. Let me no one here admire that kind of worship. Sincers dress the way they want. The brother can even put pins in the ear. But for us brother, sister, this is old time holy spirit that devil want. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you take our pastor go and preach in one of those CHURCHES just two services where they having 2,000 followers you remain with 12 or 10 because this old time Holy Spirit Bible say THAT THE EARLY CHURCH TIME. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE CHURCH WAS IN TENSION TENSION. I think after the death of praise be to God. And that is the first love BECAUSE GOD TOLD THEM RETURN TO THE FIRST LOVE. God enjoyed THAT BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS THAT FEAR FELL UPON PEOPLE IF YOU HAD TO JOIN THAT CHURCH. THERE IS NOWHERE IN THE BIBLE WHERE THE BIBLE SAY THE CMI CAME TO INVESTIGATE of the MAN AND WOMAN WHO DIED IN TVF. Have you read it anywhere? Just drop some kid on the bin and they meet the child when they are still leaving. All security organizations they will look for you. &gt;&gt; BUT HERE COMES A MAN WHO HAS SOLD THIS LAND AND BROUGHT THE MONEY TO THE CHURCH TO HELP DVF WITH LAND COST. PRAISE BE TO GOD. HE WENT AND SOLD HIS LAND. LET ME take &gt;&gt; we remaining with 75 million. Let me get this 40 million and also take a time brother Julius gave a lot of and then he was recognized that was the spirit behind. So when I sold it 100 million, I think it was sell all and bring. She sold maybe all and brought a quarter. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD IS SO GOOD. ALL NIGHT I WAS PRAYING AND THE HOLY GHOST CAME, God moved in her. My wife is coming. You know, she was quite by anointing. She was she woke up when she was but she's coming and the pastor was worshiping. Wow. Glory. If it is pastor will speak some tongues there if he will want to excite you very well he will speak something that was not the BROTHER IS THIS ALL hallelujah praise the lord Yes, Pastor Peter. &gt;&gt; God always gives chances. ARE YOU SURE? ABSOLUTELY. SURE. SURE. My brother is speaking the truth. You mean you don't trust me? All right. You have not lied me. You've lied the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Imagine brother shalom shalom falling down and dies and then you check the heartbeat and it is no longer there. I doubt whether Praise be to God. What am I trying to show you? That was the fear in the church. SISTER CAME 30 MINUTES with a new bag maybe tinkling shoes because I tr I believe they were Yeah. So everybody had to know that they and maybe the brother had a special seat. The pastor tells us that sit with your wife. So maybe that day brother came and sat in front &gt;&gt; the way where usually brotherham sits there came &gt;&gt; and then sister came with artificial &gt;&gt; probably had put on new hair up to the back with the back and some small uh lip Yeah. There also believer say you know my lips break break. &gt;&gt; So I have to put China. What is the purpose of your saliva in the mouth? Your tongue is to to WET YOUR LIPS. WHY DO YOU WANT artificial one? WHAT IS THE purpose of this? This is wiper when it is raining. Yeah. They wipe that. So you remove it and you write with the rain. Sister came. I am for that. I am REMEMBER THAT WAS shortly after the PENTECOST and the pastor was preaching. Receive the Holy Ghost. NEVER LET YOUR CONVICTION DIE. THEY'RE enjoying meals. They have time to ATTEND FELLOWSHIP. HOW CAN YOU PRAY FOR TWO HOURS? ARE YOU NORMAL? GOD IS EVERYWHERE. YES. The Bible say they KNOW HOW TO QUOTE. THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN YOU'RE JUST OPENING YOUR MOUTH ANSWER, I don't have time to pray long. I just open my mouth. So what about hello? Hallelujah. Maybe when she was entering, she ped the brother of those days of those days. &gt;&gt; I have a test and she had even come late and MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE INCIDENT THAT HAD HAPPENED, maybe brother Julius gave her time to give a taste Praise the Lord, brethren. &gt;&gt; God is good. God is good all the time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That is his nature. Praise the Lord. God did it. This week, AMEN. SISTER &gt;&gt; SISTER SAF is this all that you &gt;&gt; Yes pastor what the husband says even me it is what I'm saying but I thank God that my wife is not like that when I say something that is wrong she will she will interject But SISTER &gt;&gt; don't be yes WOMAN THE BROTHER TELLING IS TELLING TO BREAK THE WORD many and pastor Peter said the men were from buring your husband buring my husband My husband left management. He was spiritual. &gt;&gt; You have not lied to me. But you have lied the Holy Ghost. She also felt the church. Don't joke. And if this message, if the bride is going to write another book OF let us be careful. THE FEAR FELL AMONG HIS PEOPLE. I BELIEVE WHEN THE STATE feared the president say what's happened then maybe they inhered be the name and that is the church God want us to be PRAISE BE TO GOD. WE SHOULD NEVER LET THIS CHURCH BE A FOR BE A FORMAL CHURCH NEVER BECOME A FORMER WASHER. PRAISE BE TO GOD. HOW CAN A CHRISTIAN DOES IN CHURCH? THAT IS THAT IS a sin. Just imagine the president is speaking it is sin. And if you want sin, brother, do you have a proof? &gt;&gt; Yes. When Uticus was dozing in church, God never tolerated that. He allowed him to somersault &gt;&gt; and he died and this is me. I think the reason as why resurrected maybe soul was going in the wrong place. He was dozing when the own of life was speaking. So he had to be given another chance. Blessed be the name of brother says turn on the light. He says the man turn on the light. He said that the grain should mature with the light. The thing is TODAY THE CHURCH GRAIN DON'T WANT TO MATURE. WANT TO STAY BACK TO STAY LIKE IT WAS BACK. BUT THIS IS ANOTHER HOUR. THIS IS ANOTHER DAY. THIS IS THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE GOSPEL. It is coming to maturity. Amen. Many of them look like Christian. Act like CHRISTIAN TO have Christ INSIDE OF YOU. WHICH IS THE WORD MADE MANIFEST. OH, IT WILL NEVER MATURE INTO A REAL BIBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIAN. NEVERTHELESS, I HAVE SOMEWHAT AGAINST you because thou has left your first love. The true church has lost first LOVE as the love of bride and groom. at their marriage and year of wedding of wedded life of a of a complete love and abandonment to God. Praise be to God. Is typing it with our early life of marriage. Praise the Lord. When she steal honey, sweetheart, &gt;&gt; darling, &gt;&gt; babe peps, &gt;&gt; sweet peps, &gt;&gt; Rolex, &gt;&gt; Rolex, &gt;&gt; whichever name you want. &gt;&gt; But many time you forget. that honey crystallizes. That doesn't mean that's no longer honey. Praise be to God. You just need to raise some little tempering for it to melt. Blessed be the name. So that's what the prophet is typing here. First love where you come TO CHURCH. YOU SPEND A NIGHT HERE PRAYING. EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE MORNING ARE HERE AT 7. IT IS ALREADY BURNING. PRAYING PRAYING FOR THE CHAIRS. FOR PULLPIT SPEAKING IN TONG. YOU ARE CRYING TO GOD YOUR HEART FOR THE SERVICE. YOU ARE PUTTING DEMONS UNDER under rest. But time came brother sister JUST KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT PRAYING no one is praying. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. WE ARE DUTY BOUND TO maintain by the grace of God the spiritual temperature of this church high by doing our PART and we leave the rest what we cannot do for God. BUT JUST IMAGINE YOU'VE NOT prayed in the morning. You not prayed through the week and then you come to church at 11 OR AT 10 OR LATE AND when you reach here you just bow your head. Amen. Amen. Amen. Then he started clapping. You missed the morning prayer. THE MORNING ANGEL WHO DID THE FIRST roll call, you were not there. AND THEN BEFORE THE SERVICE END, YOU'RE ALREADY OUT, THE ANGEL COME BACK again for another role. When you take the list before God, you are abusent. Amen. Return to your first love. Let us return to our FIRST LOVE. LET US SEE GOD WHILE HE'S STILL NEAR. Whichever things WE ARE SEEING IS PASSING AWAY. S F AWAY. CLOTHES FADE. EVEN THE FASHIONS THEY PASS AWAY. Today you having a nice hair before you realize it is changing. Praise be to God. YOU CARE A LOT ABOUT YOUR HAIR THAT YOU SPEND TWO hours just doing THE HAIR. YOU SPEND THREE minutes in prayer and you are Christian. Are you Christ like let this be our mirror? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Just know that fashion will fade away. The beautiful mothers we are seeing today. I mean the old mothers we are seeing today. They were once beautiful like &gt;&gt; recent just I think two days ago I was uh I went to the village and I looked at my mother and I couldn't believe But that's nature. So let the hawker devil not deceive you but be soaked in the word. LET THE WORD GUIDE YOU. LET THE WORD GUIDE YOUR DRESSING. LET THE WORD GUIDE YOUR FASHION. BLESSED be the word. AMEN. LET THE WORD BE YOUR DESIRE because heavens and earth will pass. But this word will never pass. DON'T STAY HOME IF GOD IS IN YOUR HEART. YOU CAN'T HARDLY WAIT FOR THEM TO OPEN OUT YONDER. YOU FEEL LIKE NOT GOING to the church, but you work from Monday to Saturday. No single day you feel like not going to but you're working so hard to impress your boss for even a promotion. But let me tell you, the Bible tells promotion comes FROM GOD FORCE, BUT from Almighty. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm so tired. Serving God is a sacrifice. Jesus reached that point and said, "Father, it is POSSIBLE WEARY." &gt;&gt; Have you ever sweated blood? Jesus sweated blood. YOU ARE SAYING YOU'RE GIVING UP. THE BIBLE SAYS, "HAVE YOU EVER RESISTED SIN TO THE POINT OF BLOOD? BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. Listen as I'm winding up &gt;&gt; in here fellowship with your brother. If you don't feel that way, then I tell you it is time you go to pray. If the spirit of God is in your heart, you you will not wait for those doors to be you not sit at home when the service comes. And here he says, if you feel that way, it's time you go to pray. TALK OF YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU KNOW I HAVE examples that's why that is why I wonder somebody slept from 7 in the morning up to 6 in the evening. When he wakes up, the first thing is to go to the phone after the phone eating. After eating &gt;&gt; phone bed, this is a dead generation. Bathing long time forgotten. There's a young girl I know. Uh-uh. She's not here. &gt;&gt; You I don't know. You know, I don't know you, but she she's she can work on herself. She amen. That is the spirit of THIS AGE. TOO LESS EVEN TO SHOWER. LET ME HOPE THEY ARE NOT HERE. Our young brothers, let me hope you don't behave like that. WHEN GOD WAS GOING TO MEET ISRAEL, THIS IS INTERESTING. Let them shower. Let them WASH THEIR CLOTHES AND NOT GET CLOSE TO THEIR WIVES. Maybe that's why you have not received the Holy Ghost. You have repented. You have done everything. But maybe you don't want to shout. Praise the Lord. THAT IS THE SCRIPTURE. GOD IS CONCERNED ABOUT OUR BODY AS WELL. YES. Even our clothes. &gt;&gt; Sometime we come to church. WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO WORK, YOU ARE SMART. BUT WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO CHURCH, YOU REACH HOME, YOU MOVE YOUR DECENT CLOTHES, MAYBE YOU get I have to have to be very careful here. Okay. Maybe you get a t-shirt with the word Uganda Uganda. Hey, brother Martin, you're getting too fast. My brethren, what I'm trying to say is this that God IS SO CONCERNED EVEN about how we present ourselves. Amen. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAMMER THIS, the young PEOPLE OF THIS GENERATION WILL BE SURPRISED. ONE DAY brother will COME WITH A VISIT. BUT WHEN THE HOLY GHOST IS IN YOU, HE WILL GUIDE YOU. I'M GOING THE FATHER, I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU ALONE. AND THE HOLY GHOST WILL HE WILL TEACH YOU THIS THING even how to conduct yourself. &gt;&gt; Jesus never put on a Christian showering is a must. Yeah, you know our church is we have some good passage of young people. We can't speak about this because we don't speak about betting. WE DON'T SPEAK ABOUT GAMBLING. IT'S ALL ABOUT JESUS. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS WE ARE AMBASSADORS. GOD'S AMBASSADOR REPRESENTING ANOTHER COUNTRY OF HOLINESS where purity REIGN of decency. YES. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY WOMEN PUT ON modest appear with SHAMEFESTEDNESS but we are in a generation a woman will look at you. You meet them outside, she will look at you like this and then you look aside, she can look at you and even wink to say what is next but not daughters of God. They have they they have some shame. All Sarah's daughters are like that. They have shame. Shame. He can be there. It's as if he's not on the thing, but he's there. It is godly to be like that as a woman. But a woman saying, "What are you waiting for? Are you a kid? Run for your life. BUT THE DAUGHTERS OF GOD, THE SONS OF GOD. OUR CRY AND OUR DESIRE IS TO BE like him. Walk like Jesus. TALK LIKE JESUS. YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I always say whatever thing which consumes a lot of your time apart from prayer, &gt;&gt; it is the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a small god called phones. Let us be sincere and honest. &gt;&gt; Then it also has applications. You will tell me brother Martin I use this thing to preach the gospel. That is okay. But if at all you're using it to preach the gospel as you're saying, how many souls so far that have been baptized coming from your Tik Tok you are having 3,000 followers. Where are they? What are they following? Are you TAKING THE 3,000 SOUL TO HEAVEN OR TO HELL? So you better go and revisit your platform. Some believers they post funny funny things because they want followers. They follow us as you follow who? PAUL SAYS, "FOLLOW ME AS I FOLLOW YOU. BUT BECAUSE INIQUITY SHALL ABOUND, LOVE OF MEN shall work strong." Some have platforms. AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT SOME BELIEVERS ALSO HAVE THAT PLATFORM, they have account where they do their funny things. And also another account for everyone and there they will even change. I will not put there brother Martin. Uhuh. &gt;&gt; I will not put my name there. I will look for something. Oh, nature peacock. &gt;&gt; Oh, a peacock. Now, as you say, you cannot know who. Don't forget there is an eye washing you. &gt;&gt; THERE IS AN EYE &gt;&gt; WASHING YOU. I DON'T CARE HOW MANY FAKE ACCOUNTS YOU have on your social media platforms, but there's an eye. It knows every account with every name. Don't repent and change and do what is right. And the blood covers your sin of judgment. It will be presented before you. where you record yourself dancing naked. On that day we shall see the real dustless news. My brothers, &gt;&gt; let us return to the first line. Real worship, genuine worship, REAL PRAYER, SERVING GOD, SUPPORTING THE WORK OF GOD, GOD. Praise be to God. We have to say these things because this is what's going on and we have to help our sisters and brothers helping ourselves. You say that brother you have gone too personal if you're doing the right thing. Why don't do things on the light? Yes. M if you're posting the right thing on your status and you block some believers from it. Yes. WhatsApp have that provision WhatsApp. You can hide things from 100 people or a thousand and you only allow two people to see. Why do you want your light to shine for only two people? Let your light shine to the world. Let me hope they are not here. If you here in your heart, I'm sorry because I've never I've never visited apart from pastor's status maybe and some few brother Julius. Yeah. But one person does not check people status. So don't quote me wrong. And I'm speaking this because I'm standing before the pool. I don't check only just button on you. &gt;&gt; It is only some few. May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we rise on our feet? The musician. Oh yes. Precious father in the name of Jesus. We thank you for this afternoon and we thank for the word that has gone forth. Blessed Jesus, we know that when you send your word, it will not return to you vid. Lord, you know the integrity of my heart. I was not attacking anyone, but I just pray because you led me that way. Lord Jesus, you know our downfalling and oppression. You know our failures. Lord, you know our troubles. You know the things we are battling with. I'm not saying this because I'm perfect. I'm fighting as well every day that you give me the grace. Help each one of us where your word has caught us unaware. Father, forgive us. Be merciful unto others. Restore our faith. Give us that love again, that fervent desire to seek you to thirst after righteousness. That is the cry of our heart. Heaven Father, if there be someone whose heart he desire, may the Holy Spirit speak to that heart and compel that heart to know that is not personal. Precious Jesus, give us the grace to overcome. We cannot do without you and we are leaning on your everlasting. Bless the congregation this morning.

So since for the interest of time I just want to send in a prayer request. Yeah. The surgery has not yet been done and there are more risks to take ahead of us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The doctor said that there's a chance of working on the eye and it doesn't work out then I have to wait for one whole year to work on it again. If they work on it many times it gets scars and then later on it fails to work totally. Yeah. The other option they gave us is to work at least to improve this one which has some sight or I wait with this one for one whole year until it's ready to be worked on. And therefore I'm requesting for your prayers so that the surgery comes out successfully. It's going to be around 3rd Jan. That's when we are going to go back for operation and I'm sorry to say that I won't be around for the youth meetings and I missed you so much. May God bless you. I'm going to ask brother. Let us ask brother to come and lead us in this prayer of faith as we pray for our brother. Amen. Pray from the bottom and from the depth of your heart. Let us pray. Almighty God, creator of heaven and earth, give out every good gift, we come before your presence with all our heart, pleading to you. The Bible tells us the chastisement of our peace was upon you. By your stripes, we are healed. Heavenly Father, I pray that you may intervene. Precious upon our brother, many things that he has served you in. And as we love him, Lord, father, we desire that it's well with him. Let the power of the Holy Ghost descend upon him right now. The crown of his head, the soul of his feet. Let it surround him. Father, we pray for a miracle. Father, we know that miracles are have done them before. Lord, you can do it. Father in any way, even the person that is going to work upon you, if it is your choice, Lord, I pray that you may guide those hands by the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Lord, the perfect thing might be done. We surrender our brother right now for the praise and glory of your name in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. So the Bible says that by his stripes we were healed. Amen. And as the prayer has been made, let's keep trusting the Lord that something has been done. Praise God. Have you been blessed by the word? Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Thank you brother Martin for the word. We thank God so much. So as we are going to close let's just sing this uh simple chorus.
