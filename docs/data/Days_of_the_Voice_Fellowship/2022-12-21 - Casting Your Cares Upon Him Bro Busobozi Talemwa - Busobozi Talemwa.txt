TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yes I have a note here there's a lot of cares and so uh the spirit of the Lord led me to speak on this today casting your cares upon Him welcome back sisters amen Amina um casting your cares upon Him a friend in the time I will not belong as usual on Wednesday but I've been so much burdened to speak on this subject and I'm going to begin with a quote which I sent one of us and it was at a time that was uh a bit difficult for them but tonight I'd like us to talk about casting our cares upon the Lord why you Traders all of us here have cares for nobody wants at one point or the other in our life [Music] all of us have problems we go through things but here the prophet says in the message the mighty conqueror under pressure is what he is when he is under pressure have you ever been under pressure raise up your hand can you go now we can see you now smiling we can see you speaking with your friends we can see you laughing but that's not really you now yes the real you or your yeah when you are under pressure is when you are going through a tough time is when things are not going as you expected to go is when you don't have any money in your pocket when you you you have undergone a certain difficult situation [Music] is when you are going through problems is when you are down in the valley that is when we know who really you are a man is under pressure when a man we know a man when he is under pressure his real true characteristics [Music] to see whether there is any flaws in them I remember when we used to be in school especially high school and also the elementary primary you know you people would be there some of them they don't want to [Music] those who behaved as if they knew everything better than everybody else [Music] and you know before the government intervened to say that we shouldn't be children government I remember that we had a teacher his name was Mr walakira to come after the exams have been given and the results are out so he would come with a big Road in the class [Music] Hallelujah and I think brother we understand you need someone needs to help him listen to to make it a very good sound okay so and he would come with this road and then he would say anyone who is below below 60. you're facing it rough today I'm going to give you 10 of them and he would even tell you a day before [Music] I tell you I'm marking your exams and I'm coming back soon I'm bringing your results anyone who is below and not none of you have even from the what I've marked so far none of you is even above 40. anyone who is below and so pressures would begin to go up precious will begin to go up everybody was worried because we did not actually know how many you scored but those of you who knew that I tried my best you know they were a bit calm and those of us who trusted in God said anyway that they will come and they will go so we will not get worried praise the name of the Lord I'm sure that most of you went through that but you see in life because when you grow then you begin to see life differently you don't see life anymore as a child but you see life now as an adult and of course you come from being a younger adult to being an adult you take different pressures in life and then when you get married you get different pressures and then you know when you get jobs or you get different pressures I have to wake up very early in the morning oh I have to find food for my family so now our life really human life is full of a lot of pressure but here what tonight what I'd like to talk about how should a child of God behave under pressure when you find yourself when your back is against the wall you know when you find that you have no hope what are you going to do teach again to cause a child of God praise the name of the Lord during times of distress times when you have wants and needs you don't see anyhow you're going to meet them you need money and you clearly do not know how you're going to get it wait again and maybe your business is no longer working well maybe you've lost a job you know or maybe your parents can no longer take care of you know maybe some people going to loneliness you know there is nothing as bad as loneliness because if you are lonely it can easily get into depression depression and when you go into depression you feel disillusions you feel confused in your heart and you know others get into situations of heartbreak when you had confidence in somebody or something and then you were just let down you know hopelessness there is a lot of situations we can talk about during those hard times in your life and I hope I'm communicating to each of us tonight how do you behave when your back is against the walls when you can't think no more for a solution when somebody has disappointed you when you are in trouble when you feel your heart is ripped in pieces in many ways those are sad times those are hard times and I tell you people often do a lot of things you see you see it in Uganda we have a word you need to find campus but you are confused foreign right all of us here for normal you have been there before praise the name of the Lord people what did you do when you were in such times all of you can speak what you did but your mind mostly people cry what is wrong with you what if I can express what I'm feeling but I can't express when someone asks you what is wrong because we are going through a tough times as if someone has put them on a steroids how does they get angry you know you just talk to them they just sit back at you then you know I think he's distressed right I mean others they disappear or they forsake their responsibility we will find a father because he has no money we have many of us in our generation they leave the family there they disappear interesting because of what they're they're going through in their life they disappear my father was one that did that a lot of things that this distressed and depressed him one word interview and he collected all of us in the home I am the fourth of five children and he said wherever I've taken you in school [Music] that's the best I can do [Music] now all of you when now you need to fend for yourselves and he disappointed us he left us with our mother nature Allah saw him I last had my father in our home when I was 13 years old that's where I had to grow so fast so early I would change and we have a lot of families like that we have a lot of children like that most in our society they've been for seconds why because they are fathers or their parents or their mothers they were depressed they were distressed they were in need they were in confusion who are thrown into you know garbage you find babies who are thrown on the road in the hospital why why because the mother was depressed and distressed and confused and heartbroken [Music] they will find consolation they will find a peace of mind you know others when they are in those situations they break down they become still you know you ask him what is wrong with you he can't speak to you you know have you ever been around people like that when they're depressed they just become foreign [Music] [Music] you used to be happy they break down they lose their morals they lose their Joy they lose they they lose their enthusiasm this is how people different people react in the situation [Music] and the devil lies to them but when they do this they will find consolation they will find Comfort by their funeral is you know others they say oh right now I feel like I can't understand I'm confused I'm put up let me go and take a walk into the nature just leave everything there foreign let me go to the forest somewhere when I feel that Forest when now we need our coming out oh I think I'll I'll be encouraged is that not true to be true people react that way it's about you and others just go to be alone if you you know when Daddy says I want to be left alone not even a rat can pass them you just know he's now he doesn't have money now he's confused I foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] when we are in such situations of distress trouble confusion when we are in need when we don't have money when you are you know in Allah in one foreign [Music] and the pride of Christ we must always be found to be different from all other creatures you know if you were to be bad singers we are Egos and ego flies higher than any other bar um when you feel you cannot move on you feel you're confused when you are distress my sister when you're troubled on every side what are you going to do I want to tell you there is only one thing foreign he is able foreign [Applause] when is my God and his father we are telling him but Samson you are special you are you you are going to fulfill a purpose Samson you're going to redeem Israel from the moment he was a baby and he grew knowing that yeah but when the devil captured him because of lust for an unbeliever woman then the devil captured him they took off his eyes and they made him to make sport for them and oh man remember that brother as he was right there they took him up after he has played games for them he remembered he remembered who he was I'm a Child of God but see the situation I am in and I've been better changed him he would have said yeah let me cry said no I'm not going to cry let me shut down can't be vehicles [Music] if I reach there I will say Lord I also failed if you would have said undergarment let me just Hallelujah it was a desperate prayer he got a pillar and he said he was calm yeah when you are in trouble brother sister why because you have a living God and your God does not sleep and this man was calm but when he reached Hallelujah oh my goodness hey it was more than tongues Charities it was more than prayer it was more than
