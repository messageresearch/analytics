you bless everyone We Appreciate You Lord in Jesus name amen I greet you in the precious name of Jesus this evening amen can you greet your neighbor tell them God bless you amen this evening by the grace of God we are also speaking to evening light by Tabernacle Congress Avenue and Saints on the zoo my greet you in the precious name of Jesus Christ asked us to speak again today and we are also having this as our Wednesday evening service here this will be a blessing to everyone so if you can check your Bible we are opening in second Corinthians and we are reading from verses 3 to verses 6. for for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not Kano But Mighty through God to putting down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled is Father Lord we ask your blessing Lord tonight upon your word that we have read and The Souls of people that you have predestinated to be able to hear the sound of our voice this evening pray Lord it used to be a blessing to every one of us foreign so I'm speaking to you this evening on bringing every thought to captivity bringing every thought to captivity now in the message influence influence in 1963 God is Prophet says God is so many presence knows what you are doing and every soul and every and even your thoughts one time while I was in a vision I was speaking to a big being standing by him back he said your thoughts are louder in the heavens than your voice on the earth [Music] this is now an angel of the Lord speaking to uh brother I'm telling him that your thoughts in heaven are louder than your voice on Earth foreign you might say you you do this and you do that and it but you see down in your heart if you think different you are doing something wrong you should be just what you are the heart the mouth should speak what is in the house and so we find that the people doesn't realize the presence of God you know they ought to be like David the man was the man was after God his own heart [Music] he said the Lord is always before me wherever he goes he remembers God is always before him he's on my right hand and I will not be moved now David always knew the Omni presence of God like you that he was always there God is Not only there when you're in church God is Not only there when you are hearing the word God is always there God is there in your dark moment God is there in your bright time God is there in your Corners deep Corners there God is there at night and is there during that time and now I want to bring to your attention this evening a spirit or a demon that has captivated many people [Music] in our generation to the extent that many of them have come to a point of losing their minds and they've had to go and begin you know they have had to go to the uh to to their hospitals and get medications others have gone to the psychiatrists and this is reality it is happening to people maybe it is happening to some of you that are listening to me they can call it you know oppression or whatever it is but we know what our Prophet says these are demons it's a spirit which has been sent from the kingdom of darkness to come and oppress you come and take you out of your god-given place and bring you to a place of captivity and so now there is something else that is binding the people that is captivating them that is uh the devil is coming in their thoughts the devil is coming in their souls and really has always come in thoughts this is as we shall see this is the place where he usually fights but you see uh we've had people people hear voices you know voices speaking to them and they think things sometimes things that are very nasty sometimes things that are very filthy and they want to overcome this kind of thoughts but sometimes it feels as if that thought unto you is the same person and it might be you know a thought that is filthy in a way of sin [Music] it might be a soul that is not actually about Sin but it might be speaking to you in your mind telling you how bad you are whatever you are good for nothing you cannot accomplish anything you are a failure that you know things are not going to work out for you I am just depressed I am under the control the Captivity of these things I don't know what to do now you may not be safe you may not go to jail but you may be in another situation which is almost similar to that you hear voices whereby you think you know something convinces to go a certain direction of life to do certain actions this is almost like impossible for you to break away from those songs I want to announce to you tonight and let me tell you he's coming in our generation to put all of us under captivity to whereby we cannot attain the god-given promises you know God has already arranged for each of us already arranged for us he knows where you are going what you are going to attain but here is the bad news the devil knows that too and when he comes and don't forget the devil cannot come to anyone that is useless are you hearing me if you you have been fighting these thoughts foreign [Music] [Music] the thought of God about us we know the promises of God for us but you see when the devil brings our other thoughts that that is the difference and let me tell you the one way that the enemy will try to fight that he knows it is almost a sure win [Music] is when he comes to fight you by you know see when if the devil uses somebody else you can write big customers but when the devil uses you now yesterday many times this is difficult so many people that this is the devil and this is me until many times many people have come to a place of acceptance and they say I think this is that is not of God is not you thinking it is [Music] you know and he began to to talk to him many times we think it was the devil leading Jesus and the devil was another person [Music] but it might encourage you to know it might actually comfort you to know that Jesus was actually fighting the devil in his thoughts and this battle Jesus and this battle you will win it because remember we are we are not supposed to fight we are trophies of his grace we are supposed to attain in every victory that he attained for us by faith and so Jesus found the devil in his thoughts yes and we in the same way amen I want to tell you there is a power man there is a power that comes by the word of God that gives us amen the grace to bring down everything to bring it down to captivity amen that's how we are able to stand and we remain standing as children of God otherwise we would have been on medication some of you don't even sleep maybe oh you don't have good sleep because of souls but the Bible says God gives his beloved sleep [Music] foreign foreign we are human beings like anybody else we are not carrying on we are not we are not carrying on our spiritual warfare according to the flesh using the weapons of man we are not going to fight our battle together according to the flesh using guns using words no because we are not fighting a physical battle and I would recommend each of you read the message the greatest battle ever fought alternative [Music] 1962 he says the greatest spot to ever fall she is going on right now in here even now as I'm speaking to you even know the day of your life you've gone through this battle it is going on right even here now so you are thinking this battle is going on she's raging in your in your mind many times we think that people are in church but someone can stand up and walk away not because they have been offended by the preacher but because the devil has overcome them even when the word is going on by those evil imaginations God you will differentiate your voice and the voice of Saturn [Music] those thoughts are not your thoughts those are certainly thoughts is the devil speaking to your mind telling you the negative things because when you speak you will only speak according to his word because you are his sister your son can only speak according to his son can only speak according to his father are you and even Jesus said that without him I can do nothing [Music] as far as I am concerned without him we can do nothing you can do nothing but you see everything else comes in from the wrong one he says the greatest spot to ever fought she's going listen listen she's going on right now in here now you see sometimes the spirit of God will come and speak against what you know you are doing oh what you're going through at that moment the battle is ready God is telling you drop it leave it work away from that life but another voice is telling you no you cannot there is a battle going on and he says Shine Your spear soldiers foreign [Applause] foreign Hallelujah what are preachers to do oh what is the work of the preachers to stand there and motivate you foreign [Music] foreign when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the butter to rage and that Battlegrounds begin in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin or began and that is because that decisions are made from the mind and that listen listen and now they never started it from some organization they never studied it from some mechanical Affairs the grounds of God it says the grounds never started there all territory Jennifer that organization can never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds where you have got to meet your enemies you've got to take to make your choice foreign [Music] that's where it starts and when you hear the word where does it come fast where does it come fast to the mind if your man clears it it goes down to the heart but many times people's minds reject the words and the moment you reject the world it is as if you are a duck the world has been powered out just shake it off and you are still as dry as you were in the beginning and you remain with that Stony heart Nursery because you gathered the word away from your mind the devil will try to bring you this is study and the devil is always trying to point you to someone's failure yes but he tries to keep you away from the real testimony that is genuine when I tell you it is possible for you to marry what government a good wife who is a Believer the enemy will tell you how about the other one and the other one failed and the island failed the devil will never show you one good testimony he will never show you genuine testimony testimony Hallelujah there came ten of them they all had negative testimony the devil showed them negative but there were two amen these are positive testimony they may not have had enough proof to prove all these people why only a few we are the right ones out of the men but what they had was a thus saith the Lord because God said it but his servant is amen Moses it is going to come to pass and they implore the people please believe it God has proved it over and over we have even gone to the land we have even seen the fruits and we can Testify the land is foreign [Music] you are gone praise the name of the lord the devil will take you and bless you in accordance in a very silent place [Music] there's no picture to encourage you anymore there is nothing you are the Lord and you will be there he'll begin coming you know when the devil wants to overcome here he will isolate you first animals like lions can be able to eat this kind of animals isolate them from the cross that's why you have to stay in Fellowship be in charge as much as you can listen to The World God is omnipresent everywhere you are you naturally leave us though God is singing your thoughts in heaven are louder than your wife I'm showing you a way to overcome you can bring those thoughts into captivity I'm not saying you won't have them I'm saying that you can't bring them to captivity you are living above them but he tries to keep you away from the Real Testament that's what the devil does he will point you out to a hypocrite sometime who went out impersonating something he didn't do it because he was impersonating that person because that person failed because he was impersonating but the devil will point you to that person if you have not changed is because you have not opened your mind the devil still captivating your thoughts but I tell you try my God open up your mind and you ought to be able to tell somebody if it never works for you try my God if you can't have a baby someone ought to give a positive testimony if you can't get married if you can't live a holy life young person try my God these are things that God has made others to overcome if you can't overcome them it cannot remove the fact that God is able God is able to heal foreign but if it comes from the true source of the word of God heavens and us shall pass away stay there yeah and I tell you usually I always see those people speaking negative that's a bad example foreign um it must be accepted in the mind meaning the word of God it must be accepted in the mind then just believed then the word of God becomes a reality if you you guard your mind and you don't accept it the word cannot become a reality then every senses of soul and body is just scored out with the Holy Spirit when you accept the word of God in your thinking when you cast down all those evil imaginations then he says the word of God is a reality foreign amen you're feeding you're testing you're hearing you're smelly every part of your will become flattered in the Holy Ghost will be under the subjection of the word of God then your sense of God you're conscious of God everything that is [Music] so you're breaking out of Cycles you're breaking out of addiction you're breaking out of evil Souls you're breaking out of all these sorts of things in the world when it lands in your soul it is too late [Music] he can't stop it and it becomes as if it is God help us everything that is not a doubt anyway there is nothing can rise nothing can rise up there is nothing can come up in the memory and say well I remember Miss Jones try to trust God for healing one time but if that channel has been cleared out and being purged has been filled on the inside with the holy spirit that doesn't even come in memories it is and nobody else but you too there is your battle will kill him at the beginning foreign get a hold of your demons kill them at the beginning right in your mind stop him stop him dead in his truck it ain't how long you can make the world linger see it is stop it right now the problem is many of us try to linger [Music] foreign we've opened that gate and she doubted right in her mind when she had it and reasoning began but it's began in our region I know who you are God said this I won't listen to you tell me more [Music] okay I don't believe that don't entertain evil thoughts when evil thoughts come to you you will Notice cast them down that very moment how do we do for the destruction of fortresses what is a fortress a fortress is a middle stronghold [Music] [Music] you know and this is what cappuccino the enemy builds up in Our Minds The World Keeps coming and there is a fortress but the Bible says God has weapons that he has given to his children and these weapons are not physical they are not but he said they are Mighty they are divinely powerful meaning with these weapons because there is a part of divine in it [Music] guiding that story foreign [Music] hello Goliath was a representation of the evil thoughts of Saturn everyone thought to destroy Israel to Hashem but the Bible tells me the day that trust in the Lord they shall never be ashamed he will never be ashamed brother you have a Divine weapon and when David sent it the power of God came down and down he was down what was that that was a divine power but it was the choice of David all his brothers were just standing there not deciding to cast down this imagination you have to decide to cast down your imagination he says Paul uses military terminology foreign [Music] eternal room Spirit empowered believers to Christo [Music] give it to Christ oh no you cannot live like that as a young man you know be a little happier [Music] before you eat don't let it go through here does it mean you have fear children when exposed to ideas or opportunities [Music] he says here we have a choice we can recognize the danger and turn away someone tells you I'm gonna talk Gamba let's go to the club just for one night no issue no so I'm a believer I'm a Christian but I'm also a Christian let's go that moment you have a choice so well no I'm sorry I'm done I'm talking to young people ought to say it's all right when exposed to ideas or opportunities that might lead to wrong desires we have a choice we can recognize the danger and turn away or we can allow unhealthy thoughts to take us captive you have a choice you can turn away that very moment but what do many of you do you write back go away I don't want to talk to you you've simply declared that you want to talk to them I'm giving it a chance you said God what I want to talk to you again but you keep waiting for the rest so you see it away why is the gospel of Christ when Jesus Christ came he said it used to be you got my child but when you lay with a woman when you lay with a woman that is not your wife but here he says the moment you think it in your mind until some of us who have daughters we don't know how we can oh we shall raise them foreign and you know these female creatures are made in a way to respond to that kind of thing is praise the name of the Lord you just stress look she just looks at you and knows what you're trying to say if you're filled with the Holy Ghost the moment you see that you won't smile rebuke that kind of spirit someone said oh they said nothing um you know what they were trying to say you already knew what they were trying to say if you can't walk away then say something but it is better you don't even say anything just walk away from Southampton foreign he wants to give us his thoughts we can let me finish up this commentary here we can recognize the danger and turn away oh we can allow unhealthy thoughts to take us there are quite many hearings i i i a wrong spirited young man [Music] um by protecting your mind don't give them no smile yeah don't do that you know what it is oh God I can't take the voice of that young man the weekend oh God no way that moment [Music] don't let them hold you captive we capture our fantasies and desires to acquire to um when we honestly admit them to the law we're too much and ask him to redirect our thinking [Music] this is what I have you some of you have had to do for years [Music] honestly I admit this is what I'm thinking my mind is not right my thinking is not right I bring it to the altars away fill me with yourself and then what will it do he will redirect yourself he is the one who programmed you oh yeah yeah I want to announce to you tonight he can reprogram you hallelujah amen he can remodel your fingers he can help you to Captivate everything to the subjection of the world ask God to give you the discernment to keep your thoughts focused on his feet Hallelujah the weapons are in Ephesians 6 from verse 10 to 18. finally my
