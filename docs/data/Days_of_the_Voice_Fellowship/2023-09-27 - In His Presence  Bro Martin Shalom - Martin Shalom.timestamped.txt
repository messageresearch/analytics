[26:46] trust someone again
[26:48] the government that the high priests
[26:51] were in there had to be made out of holy
[26:55] hand a champion
[26:58] again

[31:08] why do you think people get that
[31:11] courageous
[31:13] even to be chatting when they're in
[31:16] charge
[31:18] it is because they are not conscious of
[31:21] the presence of God
[31:25] because they are not in God's presence
[31:30] in the name of the Lord
[31:36] the Bible tells us
[31:43] to seek the presence of God
[31:47] he never went somewhere else
[31:51] but he knew there is something about
[31:53] being in his presence
[31:56] and when he came in his presence he
[32:00] started praying yeah
[32:08] for the grace of God
[32:12] Amen and when the presence of God came

[33:13] [Music]
[33:24] when they're hanging themselves
[33:29] not dreaming you are late Grand
[33:31] grandfathers
[33:44] diabubi but this is spiritual dreams
[33:48] and this is what's supposed to be
[33:51] happening in the church
[34:01] because we know what we believe
[34:07] no this is our problems
[34:13] blessed be the name of the Lord
[34:17] he said the young man will dream they
[34:19] will see Vision
[34:22] not television City

[34:36] but seeing spiritual vision
[34:40] my brothers my sisters

[34:54] blessed with the name of the Lord when
[34:57] Isaiah went to the temple again when he
[35:00] was in the presence of God
[35:02] and God will started revealing to Isaiah
[35:06] the way he was looking like
[35:13] but he was even dwelling amongst the
[35:16] people with Anakin lips
[35:21] in the king's palace
[35:23] [Music]
[35:25] men and women
[35:30] blessed with the name of the Lord
[35:32] foreign
[35:38] [Music]
[35:46] [Applause]
[36:00] that is what happened to that on the day
[36:02] of Pentacles
[36:05] what happened there when the day of
[36:09] Pentecost was fully counted
[36:12] there came a sound of a mind now watch
[36:18] Global tongues
[36:21] what was that charity that was the
[36:25] presence of God
[36:27] and when the brothers came and and
[36:30] possessed them
[36:35] they preached the gospel in another
[36:37] fashion
[36:40] and they hear us were pricked in their
[36:44] hearts
[36:48] the presence of God
[36:54] presence of God Amen
[37:00] that is what we need
[37:03] when the prince of God is in on me
[37:08] you will not struggle with people to
[37:10] clap their hands
[37:12] you will not fight with them to live
[37:15] right
[37:19] the presence of God will do the
[37:23] meaningful
[37:26] praying God is sorrow in the house of
[37:29] men and women yes
[37:37] [Music]

[38:10] you every time when you're on phone
[38:12] you're watching muhanji and uh
[38:20] and these are men and women who are
[38:23] abused they are possessed with demon of
[38:25] obesity
[38:31] foreign
[39:02] oh brother sister
[39:06] we will see that the Rapture is so close
[39:10] the reason asked why you will hardly
[39:13] hear the Pentecostal preaching about the
[39:15] coming of the Lord
[39:19] because the presence of God departed
[39:23] from them it is
[39:37] [Applause]
[39:43] to perform on their platforms
[39:47] to entertain their people
[39:51] demons in the world people entertain
[39:53] demons in their belief so-called
[39:55] Believers amen
[40:03] they are no longer preaching about the
[40:05] second coming of Christ
[40:10] they are preaching about worlds
[40:12] those things they are good
[40:14] but if you are not careful
[40:17] will end up becoming religious people
[40:20] also
[40:23] blessed with the name of the Lord if we
[40:26] don't listen to the world
[40:28] if we don't pray brother sister we are
[40:32] not in
[40:35] me without
[40:40] what keeps you

[40:59] I will not ask you to raise your hands
[41:03] but if you know that you are not doing
[41:05] so

[42:25] that the government that the high priest
[42:28] were in the hand okay we have read that
[42:31] quote
[42:33] we find that John humbered himself the
[42:35] praise of God
[42:38] and the theme of it is
[42:41] my brother my sister and Friends

[44:21] foreign
[44:51] he
[44:55] is
[45:01] how bad the devil can anoint somebody
[45:07] and that's why the Bible says
[45:22] foreign
[45:40] that never know it's a fool satania have
[45:43] come after
[45:45] and comes tinkling shoes
[45:49] and they said today
[45:51] chameleon is going to sample us
[45:58] blessed be the name of the Lord
[46:09] amen
[46:12] the praise of God brings Holiness
[46:15] it brings seriousness
