in your name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we do not come in our own name or the name of some church [Music] the King of Kings and the Lord [Applause] we'll turn to Genesis Chapter 18 and I'm going to read verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent in voice and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thou wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him um it's certainly wonderful to be back together with friends and the family of God especially I want to thank you brother rodolwald for this invitation to be here today I want to thank you as a people of God for your prayers for me because I came through a very difficult time of my life so thank you for standing with me in prayer my friend brother wrote a wall that I so appreciate him foreign and you know we just had a wonderful time with brother George Martin and the Believers here George Martin here and it's my prayer that this church will always stand strong for the message of the hour so the coming of the Lord Jesus there's some common to send Jesus months before breasts away and one night before Buddha Martin he wrote me these words and I'll share this greeting with you today seven times greetings and blessings seven times greetings and blessings I just read through your very Noble defense of the true message of the hour is [Music] separating us son of man from this son of man in the larger designed in einen zone from this mentioned from Dame zone is mentioned to understand I agree 100 with you for years in my little assembly it's like I have cried out for the balance in the message he signed it off George Martin I believe that it was his testimony he loved the Lord Jesus and he served him with all his heart on him he was invited to be here today I wasn't able to come God had a greater plan for him amen but my son Timothy has been able to come to be with me elements on Timothy isn't to come with me and he's my hero and that's mine Health amen not for me this is 53 years of ministry I started preaching this message when I was 15 years old I was born again in this message never preached any other message if you wonder what I'm preaching now I still preach the same glorious message it's just wonderful to be with my Believers today amen I'd look over and see so many friends for the years that I've known foreign so good care of me she was like a mother to me inside of oh it's so good for me thank you thank God Amen God bless you let's see it's so great to be with you and so it is now in these Services I might refer to brother Brandon's book on the exposition of the seven churches you see I was there in 1965. when the first release of the books were brought to the Life Tabernacle in Shreveport that's the Aston house and brother Branham introduced the church age book in the Shreveport meetings he's saying my book is just out on the seven Church ages and I think we have a thousand copies here right now we were there at that meeting and we received the first copies of the churches book we have on daughter and he explained in the Shreveport meetings about his books he said you have all seen in my book well now I can say it'll all be drawn out in the seven churches which he told me which I stand by as a witness to God to be judged in the day of judgment for it um it come from God not my own thinking it's come from God amen amen so it's a book that should be accepted by all believers that's why we refer to it on this opportunity because we believe the truths that are established in that message now we have read it in the Book of Genesis of a prophecy or a type of the last day foreign tube of the legend talk where the word that God appeared unto Abraham and to Sarah as God as Sheen Abram and he asked the question where is Sarah thy wife on The Factory voice and I he said I will certainly return to you according to the time of life shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now hear him lies a prophecy of the last day so here in league and the prophetic as God would come to bring to her to her a message of restoration does God is what I want to speak on today is the message of restorations you see it was like it was in the days of lot is it it's a day when men don't want truth but they want to feel good religion they have disciples however they please and then live however they please but in a day like that Abraham and Sarah foreign and with that visitation comes an open book of inheritance that would identify Sarah in the promise [Music] you see the book is the title to everything that was lost it contains our entrance by a Rapture into the heavens where Adam wants ruled from you understand so foreign the Revelation chapter 10. of the mighty Angel where Christ himself comes down with the open books black bride in this last day so the hours of it brought him let's talk it is it is an open book identifying Us in the promise assistant and this is the crescendo it is the ultimate of all the outpourings of the god spirit this is in Abraham's day in Abraham's Park when the angel of the Lord showed upon the Earth at the end of the sound a Sheen of the earth it was a declaration that the promise of God was about to be fulfilled this sets us apart from the church at Pentecost in Acts 2. a deposit was given to the church but this time the spirit comes but Jesus Malcolm to a guy and is poured out to bring the bride into her full and complete inheritance but don't try to do away with the deposit about the Communist president hiding guys the book of the title deed is for you but without it about all of these the book is not yours is now brother Branham tells us I'm trying to do God of service the understand [Music] to an individual to do so Dennis it can't come to a group it never did that's what God promised in the shadows of the coming for his bride and Eliza and that's not God for heist and then shut in this comments for the brought and elieza so the message of restoration is not a return to Pentecost so as to perpetuate the church ages so this is the last day of harvesting because this is the calling out and the calling home of the bride and Jesus is the sister they were destined to be planted like a grain of wheat is and the early church would decline and go into the ground on the Azteca and come up as a blade but in this day abandoned this was when Seven Seals have been opened allowing us to receive the open books with this title and inheritance to what Adam lost like I said yeah this doctor this advances us to a day that is different from any other day but this is Rapture Day by Jesus talk this is the going home of the Bride about it is the long EST bridge and the mighty Angel is here domestic analyst here the fullness of Christ to usher in the fullness of what was promised to the United States this was a day when Jesus the promised son comes who does is the target but you can't to minimize its importance two thousand years of there was a sea church this is things for 45 hours it was the original Grace but it was planted so when it comes to harvest again I don't expect something different will harvest again with the wheat seeds without the holy ghosts without the Pentecostal experience you are not entitled to this book foreign foreign by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ but the abstract is not coming it's the clearing of the day that is declare on this Palace but you see you have to get a clearing of that deed do most of us the clearances when everything against it has been strictly and you've got an abstract yeah it is yours as it's dying everything that belongs to you Allah and when we believed on Jesus Christ is our savior loudness Jesus Christ and we have repented and are baptized that God recognizes our repentance and our faith toward him sends down the absence foreign this is what God has done for the church God says he does it for the individuals that's it for the church to just feeding a mind the mystery truths that were lost during the past Seven Ages have been restored to us and the claims that Satan had against the church through the past Seven Ages church had to send that a false baptism and all kinds of misinterpreted Theology and the Book of title was closed and sealed up and Jesus and now we know what is our inheritance and it is not something different from the original Church it is Jesus Christ Evangelion from Jesus Christ whole did not come and bring another gospel Paul is Evangelion the gospel was brought by Jesus to his church Jesus and yes Paul expounded the gospel and talked God Powers these Evangelion invited but he did not originate it Peter preached it he said all the apostles and on the day of Pentecost I'm tired from Kingston now the gospel was coming into Mansion it was God writing on the tables of the heart that's why God tells sheep of the tough in his health the very law of goddess now there have been many types of Pentecost before [Music] are now have been pointing to this hour and this time man oh yes hallelujah hallelujah the first Pentecost that's the things came after the slaying of the Passover Lamb come and seven weeks later on Stephen on the 50th day I'm 56 and talk after leaving Egypt police they had the first Pentecost Fest amen Amen on that day on them Todd Moses went up into the Mountain King Moses and he received the law of goddess written on tables of storms that was the first Pentecost that's not let's ask the things amen it was there at Mount Sinai it's my daughter of Maxine the tattoos say that God married Israel Buddhism and took her as a wife because he had entered into Covenant when the people went horn not to other gods and Moses and anger on Moses himself threw down the tablet and this shows that a law that is written only on Stone um but that man would break it about the menstrual expression what doesn't change the heart but his friend at least this house but man's heart can still go whoring after other gods Abu Jesus and things three thousand people died starving dried thousand men because it was a law of death but gazette's taught us amen amen Israel was given Feast to keep the Passover and and and of Pentecost and the jubilees Israel games the 50th day after the Passover was Pentecost 50 years was a jubilee where slaves could go free Australian content but they were only typing I was even wanting to or foreshadowing the coming of the perfect lamb just comment is fully common in love but finally after thousands of passovers now you know they would come uh John who would introduce Jesus and say Behold the Lamb of God come Johannes there is the Lamb yes he will take away the sin of the world and not to pass over and Pastor he became the Supreme sacrifice evidence hurts to opt for for all the sins of man the only certain dimensions for he's the Supreme sacrifice the form for an up first 50 days later through Pentecost king that's why all things can come this was a jubilee of Jubilee that's fine but those who were slaves to sin and foreign [Music] in our day I don't know foreign [Music] but now and yet is when the day of Pentecost fully comes it's been a thoughtful things to fall into filters let me announce it to death this is the Jubilee of jubilees with those who are enslaved Rising sin and darkness to its original s you can take possession to the complete inheritance therefore anything in the book that's what Alice was eating Bugis is ours is is in the book healing is salvation [Music] disguises anymore [Music] amen amen race now don't try to give us a different land than that of Jesus Peter or Paul Jesus papers and Powers this Bible is the land of the Apostles known Jesus Bible is well Paul had something different he he wasn't in the upper room you know the upper room was a place Paul wasn't there when Paul is finally started but Paul received the same experience of Apollos in feet amen don't think we have something different listen hurt when we see Israel going back to their promised lands Israel when the world wanted a solution for the Jewish people but you see they didn't want Uganda Uganda it was a beautiful land that's fine it's the fruit basket of Africa yeah but it wasn't their land they had a land they had no land that was promised to them by God that's even for God for high school no other land would do on kindness and I want to say to you we have returned to the homeland of the Bible this is London Beach so it is the land that foreign don't you dismiss prayer lines we can't get ruptured faith in a prayer line you become well let me just tell you I happen to be and see prayer lines these are brother branhams I was in brother Brandon's meeting when people receive justification I was there when a sister in my church gave a personal witness because she was she was just three or four people away from this or in the prayer line and espressos and baby he said if you repent of those cigarettes God will give you a baby don't give God your own baby and right there when God adores that woman was justified in the presence of God again by goddess and this young sister but also it's a teenager slipping around and smoking at all some teenagers and she began to pray right there forgive me God forgive me I didn't know how wrong this was this and just three to five people away from Floyd week not 10 hours these things the weeks of fasting for fast but in a prayer line he steps up in the presence of the Angel of the Lord and her sins could not be called out only of a certainly because they're now under the blood verses in the absolutely blue I've seen people filled with the Holy Ghost Japanese demons cast out himself the Holy Ghost said we are justified by they're hiding you guys know that don't you yeah the Holy Ghost feels us the Holy Ghost gives us rapturing Faith the hiding you guys no you can't get rapturing Faith in a prayer line so it comes to organize you can get the ticket the tokenization become to the Rapture amen one moment time in the presence of God no I ain't a moment in the game about God your sins canceled that is dinosaurs token of the Holy Ghost because you can't get territory in a prayer life it only comes by suffering now let me tell you suffering will develop character but it doesn't give you character I must keep the kind character character is your nature yeah and your new nature comes by a new birth annoying guys and yes you can get born again in a prayer line if you can receive the nature the character of Christ in a prayer life he can come right to your seats foreign [Music] having no hair on her head because of alopecia a disease it's an autoimmune disease with three little bobby pins with dry cleaning hot water to put in her hair sister brother Timothy Timothy says Uncle Timothy I want to wear these things and she goes through that prayer linear and just months later when I find pamon he's got a full head up here the doctor amen I've seen it over and over again yeah except speed on Vita Gazette I've seen it in prayer line chops demon Spirits were cast out I am a witness it's been a tiger I've seen him while her on the floor he shoves I've seen him turn on the beach upstairs it said it wouldn't come out but in the name of Jesus Christ it had to come out why you say brother Tim you're just turning promotions foreign has tried to prove that this blessed thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotions you see it don't stand up according to their scientific theory well I would like to ask him this what makes them change is what makes the drunkards the Drinker offered to think what makes a prostitute cease their evil life what makes the cancer and diseases depart from the people is he says is that emotion is he said it has a motion with it challenge for sure amen he said it has a motion with it certainly anything that's alive anything that that doesn't have emotion alism excuse the expression and surely it is now stroke but I think we ought to bury some of our emotionalist religions it has no emotion to it in a religion that has that emotion should be buried because it is emotional but we're in the third pole and the vision of the third poem brother Brandon said there was an altar culture somewhere and a prayer line had just been called so in the third pole the opening of the word prayer lines amen so you can't be preaching the third pull and the opening of the words and deny prayer lines and altar calls for life and debates and we cannot replace a true genuine experience with psychology foreign well how would you feel about a doctor Viva is the funeral and Doctor Who read a book on gallbladder surgery and then called himself a doctor and she steps the doctor who wants to take your gallbladder off I want him to go to school a long time and then he can tell me about gallbladders but don't try your psychology on me because you read a book on it amen let me tell you something and it's not psychology we receive this is not a mind change to received by managers so this is the land of the Bible so Jesus this is the land of faith and love and power because it is we are walking where Jesus Walks the abundance we are preaching what Peter preached we are preaching what Paul believes it is not a new gospel it is the land of our fathers and restoration is more than just restoring Doctrine is restoring sons of goddess back to their original position of sonship the land of Israel without his people is just a Barren land that's land Israel only the Lord Islam it was a wasteland in London full of swamps and Barren land full of food until the people of the book best came back to its lands and the Bible or the people without its people ordered is just another book it's Amen you must have the people of the books to their positions hallelujah hallelujah we can go to the land you couldn't get into them ancient landmarks here is Shiloh oh yes God moved in the past yes here's the brook yes these are gliders this is a very broke where David picked out five stones but without the people taking their possession about all the delighted he is the land still belongs to somebody else but in this last stage in this lesson title of allowed itself we receive a messenger and thinking behind it and found behind both angels that advances the church from the Azusa Street movement they are breaking the Mind upon these Azusa here to becoming the bride she was a Pentecost Dustin come to Zion and abroad the weak crop advancing the world of vital foreign foreign and then in verse 28 28 says come to pass afterwards my spirit does his mind guys and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dreamed dreams and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit connection now Peter picked up the same scripture to be his inauguration sermons and he said this is that which the prophet artists there's going to be a restoration come back to the same scripture one more time and it can't be so foreign [Music] foreign God damn manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy ghosts he returned to the same thing we have to have the same pure word of God the power of God signs and wonders foreign [Music] and others have reviewed and dissected the mechanic have every promise of God greater or more than these shall you do why because it was changing from a singular Ministry to a body Ministry so item Library I want to say to you is oh one man's scriptures have been fulfilled Allah we saw the manifestation of God just as it was in Jesus we saw the same Messiah sign yes that Jesus showed them through the prophetic office now thus Jesus yet what the son of man revealed himself as always mentioned these steps allowed and revealed the thoughts and intents of the heart when he said your name is Simon says where he discerned her life you've had five husbands if you're living with is not your husband this was the same sign he showed in the days of Abraham that's what the celebration when he deserves hard in the tent behind him so the sheets and discerned her heart and said why did Sarah laughed because it was the same son of man became and that sign was shown in that day but God indeed this day of a god undies and talk he did not have to gather up dusted himself for the body he had redeemed man he had a last Dimension and now he could step into a redeemed vessel and but see that when we could see the ministry of Jesus Christ repeat again amen all in a one-man Ministry and now all one man's scriptures are fulfilled Iron Man so we go back to John 14 12. so give me yes where that more than this shall you do and it goes into a body Ministry so it's not now just one man having a prayer line so this is Hysteria and you calm down you start in Uganda he's there in Belgium or France or they started in Belgium right here in Germany the same God the Savior God and there are to be healings or does it highlight and deliverance in every ministry as we are commissioned to fulfill Mark 16 to a feeling in my name is the Great Commission it is ours to fulfill it Joshua was commission to take the land so have we been commissions follow you as we did Moses we can speak the same thing that followed Moses following you foreign the things that I do shall you do also he is my name is certainly just think this relationship Amen in the word of God said and he went with his church with signs following them that believe meditation foreign fall that's where he's manifesting himself isn't his bright body inside a broad life this is the bride coming of Christ he came two thousand years ago in Groom Farm yeah and yes we will meet him in the air for the beginning when he comes but he's here right now right now on the earth Guardians here in Pride Farm yes brother Branham I challenge you to believe Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man that's the existence of bodies in the form of solar system human flesh immension flies through the bride's body just in life amen now Christ does three things as he descend knowing this is a shout amen father in vigil the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost is the Capstone until the dead in Christ raised and then they're physically changed from Mortal to immortality and kisses individuals it was a complete sonship with God's approval a psyche for communism amen robbed with power uh with power to cast out themselves on our property baptism of the Holy Ghost he's volatile from him hiding God Jesus checks signing Authority just ask anything in his name for he said you shall receive power then it's not giving father that the Holy Ghost system we who have received the token Vietnam the Holy Ghost we are not waiting for the adoption we are waiting for the Redemption of our body we've gotten off the alusalems as labors but not adoption of sons by receiving the Holy Ghost we have been recognized by God as his sons in the message the token in the voice of the thighs whether Brandon said we have a token in this day we are given open token which is an anotype of that type known this is that these types can be engaging strict citizen tube of that natural token we've been given the supernatural Supreme token tickets I love that don't you yes Supernatural Supreme token when I truly just hurts decisions oh that was worth shattered has not been given to this generation has been given the token Alice was forced to shut it is now we have the Holy Ghost here's our token yes how many hiding guys and it is our identification that that that we have accepted the death of the lamb and it says Not only was Jesus said just for human life to come back on us he was God himself manifested in flesh I was by God Saves manifested in flesh that brought back again the adoption of sons that now we are the sons and daughters of God that is decisions the token it shows that you have been accepted the sight and aside to this that your sins are gone guys [Music] you have been placed in the body of Christ amen it is our identification and Passover it is our identification that we have believed God and God is wow and this happens by the laodicean message in the seventh age the next stage the snakes inside Elder amen after the Millennium will be the Eternal age this Dawns on us when our bodies are changed amen but right now I'm a guardian you can't say we're in the Eternal age no you can't be in Eternal ages until you've received an eternal Immortal body to go with it to Constitution until then you're in the age of times so don't pretend you're already in eternity it's only pretending this is you see the bride leaves the church ages when our bodies are changed but not me brother Jim I'm already in Heavenly places you're already in eternity you're not raptured yet neither are you Immortals simply means you have been positioned in Christ with power and authority and potentially every devil is under your feet if you take possession of every promise so we do it guys so the opening of the seals is a message of restoration and it has brought us into the land of promise it is not another land it is the land of the Bible foreign foreign I don't doubt s amen there is let me just say this there is no word or no message beyond the laodicean age for the Gentiles guys kind voltage it is the last message of Jesus Christ to his church just elect the border from Jesus Christ everything else is a lie Allah I know always right we've had men arise as the eighth messenger the heart and Lord we've had our share of German Eagles that claim to be Aaron until I'm supposed to Ireland design to help Moses say what he couldn't say because he had Kentucky grammar versus Kentucky slang you know Apostles just set an order and bring Clarity to what the prophet said let me tell you the message of Jesus Christ he didn't need need a German eagle to explain it he didn't need some Aaron yeah we're beyond that today something that old Paul didn't have yeah we've got something else we got the opening of the seals the opening of the seals that's Earth from the seagulls only restored the book back to us the truth of serpentine wasn't lost upon the truth of serpentine was not lost to Paul does the divided foreign [Music] not an opportunity the lab book was not sealed to Paul the school foreign they are new to us so those doctrines are new to us he was an original landowner the two new birth was not a mystery to pause and he knew it was more than believing he said if you received the Holy Ghost sensually it was an experience where he was filled with the Holy Ghost is more than speaking in tongues because he knew that someone could speak with tongues of men and angels have the nature of God that wasn't a mystery the prophet of God in this day did not add truce to the Bible [Music] he brought us back to the land where Paul lived in the gospel Paul preached today brought light to the truth that Paul preached last of divine apologies he was a restorer to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father um [Music] oil level listen when Elijah he was a restoring prophet he did not build a new altar yeah he found the old of the old altar foreign God head back in his place the water baptism back in his face the truths of the Gospel back in his place and put Christ there on top of all those doctrines things are sacrifice and he turned the heights of the children back to the original faith on the event of the house and they've kidnaps and that's what the opening of the seals did it exposed the Antichrist spirit it's not his notary Christian guys and laugh who went forth to conquer and to conquer their King had fallen invited through it the church out of the land first us another land the denominations that we didn't belongs you see that's not our homeland you might have lived there a long time your family may have lived there a long time but that's not our homeland is the Bible amen and there must be a people return back to the Bible became sealed to the ages by unbelief starting with the demon Spirit impersonating Christ thing Ahmed and emotions on a white horse and fear going forth to conquer and the Conquering um then that horse turned Blood Red foreign but now the cover and exposed his work through the ages it's been uncovered by the resurrected Christ as Lord lamb who was playing that was close I've sent it down by Revelation the seventh angel on Earth and you have been commanded until the spirit prophesies in you peace foreign and prophecy foreign God will be in the midst of her but God will declare himself in the midst of her in the middle and every age he says he that had the spirit let him hear what the spirit says how tragic it is this first stage to not listen to the spirit thank God in the last stage there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day devolving reminded us she will listen to the spirit but you would hear nothing guys in that day of gross darkness in this outside that their teeth the light will return by the pure word return to the power of Pentecost welcome back to Lord Jesus Christ foreign [Music] Hallelujah that's what's promised in this age doesn't foreign very same thing foreign it's only been led to repentance and water baptism and needs an experience but don't hinder us don't hold back in his the Holy Ghost sanctification there's a deeper shadow of it and it was the Holy Ghost by the baptism of it deeper Shadows but now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of this very person being in here same signs and wonders he did at the beginning well what about those Old Faithful Baptist people save their lives because of disbelief in the infant baptism re-baptize those who come to Christopher they're called Baptists hey you know I think of sister Lydia wrote a while did she hear this is where are you yeah she's over there God bless you yeah right there okay but anyway her grandfather Yeah God's father she helped thousand he helped thousands through the War I have thousand thousand just didn't think it was such bravery he would write Hitler warning him he would burn in fire yes if he kept persecuting Christians and Jews before he stands for the faith he was arrested and while in prison he wrote several books with the anger Sprouts he owned a beautiful home and it was confiscated taken away from him and when the war was over the round and preached he told everyone that after he completed his trip on the exactly Aiden does not amenities last foreign they were not tonight what is a blessing to know that you today can possess the same Holy Ghost is that ought to make everyone of us rejoice that's all the influence you will love because there are no Creeds and darkness to hold it back why doesn't it the evening light is too common and it scattered the darkness upon the world the original life not just a gift of the spirit just to Justified life the original life amen the spirit of God himself just guys call himself the token today you can receive the fullness of the spirit of this guys himself let's understand something let us understand something there were many great prophets down to the age of Old Testament industry but we think we're filled with the spirit um in the Old Testament we think of Moses in my own Testament sealed with the spirit the fruit with him guys John filled with the spirit Johannes from his mother's womb that was a terminology of being filled was referring to in the anointing that's fine you see these men were working and prophesying under the anointing of the spirit for the Holy Ghost could not yet enter into humans but guys under the blood of bulls and goats or did in blood from birth because the nature of those innocent sacrifices while this is not too often for this could not come and dwell in a man Contin ues nature expelled and replaced sin nature and for the first time in all of history were possessed by the holy ghosts this is a new testament Doctrine this is that's why Jesus taught Jesus you must be born again the most following let's go to John 7 37 lessons in the last day of the great uh the great day of the feast um let's talk to The Ghost and talk is the special Jesus stood and cried and said If any man thirst let him come to me and drink stand Jesus off grievance Prophet yeah unjust that they're coming to me until he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters Hallelujah for the Holy Ghost was not yet guys you see the Old Testament Prophet so this is the Old Testament it will be anointed and in that sense be filled with the spirit not in the true sense of the spirit coming to dwell in man abandoned in advance this could not happen until the blood of Jesus Christ was shared business and then men and women could receive a new birth now Moses would get so anointed in the presence of God in the king about God even Revelation from God and things lip to ear to him and only a few days after that grieve the spirit of God I didn't guys do something that would keep him out of the promised land or advice but that's not so under the New Testament Hebrews 13 and 5. for he said I will never leave you I will never forsake his need for Simon so that we can boldly say so that's the kunzaga no it is fear what man can do to me [Music] [Music] he will never lose you hallelujah hallelujah so the anointing and the power of God would come upon men like Samson so it is he would slay thousands of God's enemies hundred thousand what God is fighting Islam only to be seduced by Delilah the
