morning devotion uh and we had also a little praise break so we are so happy and we feel refh freshed and we are ready for this morning how many are ready we are ready for this morning before we change the order of the service I'd like to recognize uh the presence of our Elder who is [Music] here let us give a mighty hand of Praise amen amen you know uh I know we are young and uh we we like saying we are the generation they failed we are going to make it well we can be excited with that and actually we could prosper in many ways that they failed and you know if you don't Prosper more than your father your father did not do a good job but because you prosper more than him it means he did a good job I would want to say this uh I'm 33 years old are you okay to speak your age brother Glover is 28 years old many of you are like really come [Music] on yes is the TR and many of you here are below 40 a few older ones and so I want to so don't D my point and so there's something I'm trying to say here there is nothing we can be without a solid foundation how many agree with me without a solid foundation we cannot become and if we do not appreciate the men of God used before us we cannot amount to anything right and so this morning I want us to stand up because Pastor Steven is um one of the first generation Elders in Uganda personally I did not come to the message through his ministry but the people that I came through the message the message through you find that they were touched by his ministry and so are yours you may not even know him maybe where you come from but back there you realize that these Elders were interconnected and because of them we can have what we are having so let us stand up clap our hands receive Pastor to come and us [Applause] for usap Hees here [Music] [Applause] God God bless you God bless you amen you may be seated ah I'm humbled and uh thank you for those rare words amen um I don't know where to start from but I want to bring greetings from the Saints back home they knew that both I and my wife Sarah would be here this morning and they are praying for this meeting I'm happy to have gathered together with the new wine bottles it can bubble it can bubble it can swell it cannot break I'm happy to have come among young people amen it's the change of [Music] order but each time we came to a junction of there was an overlap so the former age flew into the new age and the new age flows back into the old age so I want to say there will be something you need for the new age from this old wine that's the way God works that's the way God works and I'm really thankful that I've been part of the David generation fight to build the [Music] kingdom but when Solomon comes the kingdom of Peace must be seen speaking peace let the days of battle cease and let the Solomon Kingdom prove to be the kingdom of [Music] Sol that's the way we can go so I really want to appreciate you young people the generation of the upright that are fighting on to bring down the coming of the Kingdom I certainly appreciate you knowing we carry one anointing the anointing of the ego remember the ego never gets old as as young as you are I'm young as you are I know how to renew my anointing there is something about anego it always carries this brotherly love when it sees the older eego it doesn't pick it out but it comes feeds it we've got something new and then this old eag we eat on the new thing and become young again let me tell you we are an everlasting youthful age youth is an attitude the attitude of Cal that takes the so I appreciate you greet you young people Keep Holding On fight on to the coming of the Lord don't be bad be as good as Paul don't fight bad battles but be like Paul I have fought a good fight brother says fought on principes Amen so God bless you so much as to keep gaining every inch of ground in the call that God has given us in this hour you blessed and I appreciate our brothers that have come all the way to come and bless us this time brother Andrew Brother Martin God bless you bless you so much amen bless you brother app Shalom God [Applause] bless now listen to me there is something I want to say one time in our church I preached a sermon titled sowing honor and reaping access problem that our generation has we do not H older people whether they men of God or our parents some of you are here you you you look down on your parents respect them and you know it you know it while you're looking at me you but it blocks access to many things in your life is a Biblical principle trust I finish this in two minutes listen God revealed this to me when I was starting out on Ministry and it has helped me a lot you know Pentecostal they know how to honor their men of God better than message belever in the message if a pastor is not your pastor even when you meet him on the road say how are you when you meet your pastor if God has called a man to be a pastor not a pastor to his local assembly he's a pastor to the entire body of Christ if if a man is a Deon same thing if a man is a singer a woman I mean could be Ministry Administration gift into the entire body of Jesus [Music] Christ and if our generation can learn to give honor we are going to have a limitless access and I will seal those words with the testimony um I spent very many years brother Ed I know this is public and I know Pastor Sten you do not know this um the testimony you know what happened but you don't know the testimony I spent many years but the Edis first invited me to Canada in 2012 and I applied for Visa I was young um you know still in school my Visa was turned down I I was invited again and again maybe three or four five times and my Visa kept on being rejected now don't there's a reason why I'm sharing this Tes I was only applying for a visa to go and Minister I was not going to do jobs but my Visa was turned down but one day something happened Pastor I has been traveling you know in Ministry around the world since the 80s and he has wor out many passports and and so now he had a new passport and he needed a Visa so he called me up at that time I'm a pastor of my own church you know we like saying uh when you the of the local church so he called me up and he told me brother bus I'd like you to help me uh apply for a new Visa these things are complicated online and all that I want you to come and help me do that so when he told me that because of what I just told you I told my wife I don't know what God is up but if Pastor has asked me to come and help there must be something God is cooking I didn't even tell him right away I put fuel in my car I didn't aor why are you calling me don't you know that I'm also an elder I know I'm trying to kill some demons here listen I put Fel I didn't ask him for fuel I put fuel in my own car and I drove to Ginger and we were there the whole day and she he was planning to travel with mama and so we sorted all those things and um he we we placed in the um the application for now his Visa took so long I think a year two years before it you know he received a feedback and so he kept on asking me to check and I kept on ask to see whether his Visa came and there was no response and one day when he when he told me to check and I checked I Heard a Voice speak to me he said it's the it's the time I had been sent the last [Music] invitation I had it in my file and I I I felt I will not apply for this thing again is heartbreaking you know you put in your time and then they say rejected I said no Uganda is the best country on Earth after all I don't need to travel anywhere to be important I can be important in my own I said I will not apply for this so I kept the letter but while I checked his Visa the a voice spoke to me he said the time apply your Visa because of what you have done you are going to get a Visa now it just a voice that I had so I told my wife about it she said go ahead and so I applied three months I had my Visa 3 months now remember he took two years in three months I got Visa until my passport expires I can TR as much as I want as long as I want now some of you are very rightous you are saying pastor you're giving a Visa testimony every testimony is a testimony but right now I'm giving you a testimony to teach you young people when you saw H you reap access I honored the man of God and by that God gave me access that I did not even need at the time maybe you need something just go back and honor your father go back and your mother sub yourself the man God subit to them and you will see what will follow your life now if you believe that can you say a big amen amen I fail to share that it will help someone may we stand on our feet I know we are so late this morning right God is in control this is the last day we have three meetings and our pastor trust Manda is taking the first one this morning and we are ready for God to change elements in our life this morning amen Lord Jesus we are here we are ready we expect we want to see you move we want to see you do what man can Lord I am personally under great expect Lord young people many of them have been struggling especially in the real of their financial situation enough of this something must change something must happen and Lord I believe with all without doubt this is the moment Grant it Lord you have touched us filled us with the Holy Ghost healed many people here saved many now Lord may you also come in this real of our life we commit this service into your and our precious into your Jesus name amen see [Music] Grace how swe [Music] [Music] see let us pray Lord we want to thank you this morning yes Lord for the preliminaries things that have happened just before we thank you for the song service Lord the items that were rendered Lord the words that were spoken Lord we have now come to the most sa part of the service the preaching of the word amen and we know that the preaching of the word cast out devils and we know that the right mental attitude to any of God's Divine promises will bring that promise to pass and the word of God will defeat Satan at any place any where at any time and on any condition Lord you have fortified Us by the word and that word is what you have given us that we preach it and we believe it Lord May Satan be under our control to the glory of th holy name we pray for the congregation that you may circumcise the ears of the hearers and also the lips of the speaker that at the end of the day we may come back with Thanksgiving and speak to you as those men that went to a mouse they say did not our hearts burn within us as he spake to to us along the way bless the efforts that have been put together by every brother by every

pastor bless the church in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen if you may take your seats for a while I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I want to express my gratitude to the pastor again for the invitation I also want to greet the fellow [Music] ministers and the ERS also of the church may the Lord bless you for working together to make this meetings a reality amen May every effort that you put into this be I really want to appreciate brother Andrew and brother Shan they Nots are they not fire PRS are they not powerful men of God don't they preach the message thank you very much it was my pleasure to associate with you we look forward to this combination again uh in country praise the Lord amen yes and thanks for the words that you have said about respect to the [Music] elders and I also want to thank the for his words of wisdom amen May the name of the Lord be blessed and uh I know that I have no time because the time is gone but I just want them to read the scripture and read a few quotes and close if you can stand upon your feet we can read together the scripture I want us to open to the Book of John 1 verse one a very familiar scripture a very loaded scripture but I not going to unpack it I am not going to unpack it I would just mention it to verse three in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made pray that we read John 14 again John 14 verse 20 amen it says here um at that day you shall know that I am in my father and in me and I in you [Music] I want to speak on the the title the logos has a [Music] part amen yes the logos has a part Theos a blessed be the name of the Lorden so uh the prophet um has taught us many things in fact the entire Bible because we are living in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and that seventh angel is the Angel also or is the prophet of Malachi 4 God was going to send just before that great and Dreadful day of the Lord amen so Mal is a prophet to the end time generation just before the rapture but according to Revelation 10 he shall also finish the mysteries of God and the prophet says it is this divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally T the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen the prophet says this this this this prophet of Mal will do two things number one he will turn the hearts of the people of children back to the fathers number two he will finish the Mysteries then it is this divinely revealed mystery truths that will be the vehicle for turning us back to the fathers so the revelation of the word the opening of the book is the means by which our hearts attend to the fathers so he is a prophet that we received amen and he occupied so many spaces in the Bible because the prophet was supposed to be the word to us he was a son of men revealing the son of man and with the gift that God gave him which was the sign of the Messiah which was the word of Hebrews 4:12 which will the hearts of the people he was the Messiah who came in John 4 well and saw that woman of Samaria and he began to talk to her the woman spoke to him and he spoke to the woman and he said woman give me drink the woman said we have no relationship Samaritans and Jews don't have relationship but Jesus began to converse with her and the woman had said you are a Jew and I am a Samaritan but when they began to speak to each other the woman changed her attitude she began not to say you are a Jew but she said he was now a then they went on he said I perceive you are not just a but you are a prophet because the word of God come to a prophet and she went on to say not only are you a prophet not only are you a prophet but we know that when Messiah cometh he will show us these things because Jesus Christ was the prophet spoken about by Moses in Deuteronomy mes say the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me so this woman knew that this man was a prophet and she went beyond that when Messiah would come he will show us the sign of the Messiah and that was the sign of the Messiah to the Samaritan but Jesus Christ had demonstrated the sign of the Messiah to the Jew first of all demonstrated it to the Jew Philip find Nathaniel we have found him who MOS speaks about in the law we have found him the Messiah and Nathaniel said who is this Messiah where does he come from because we know nothing good comes out of Nazareth and Philip said come and see come and see the prophet says that is the best answer you can give to a man come and see Jesus did it one day John sent two disciples go and ask him are you the one to come or shall we look for another Jesus did not answer them he said come to my service come to church come to church come and see it says go and tell John what you hear and what you see I have heard with the hearing of the ear but now I see and Jesus began to demonstrate the spoken word says in Isaiah 61 the sick being healed the BL eyes they are being opened the dead they are being raised and Jesus Christ stopped he said go tell the SI are being healed the gopel is being preached to the poor the eyes of the blind are being opened and he said blessed is he that is not offended in me you know the Bible is so precise when Jesus demonstrated what he demonstrated that was written in Isaiah omitted one thing in Isaiah the Bible goes on to say and the prisoners are being brought out of prison so Jesus did not talk about that because John was in prison and John to say why am I not coming out if the prisoners are coming out and Jesus not touch that because John was in prison it was not the time that time for the prison door to open so Jesus was very precise he did did the same thing in in chapter 4 of The Book of Luke when he came from the Wilderness he was given a book of Isaiah and he went to the scripture the spirit of the Lord is upon me he has anointed me to preach the gospel to preach Liberty to open blind eyes and to help those that are oppressed and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he put a full stop where he put a full stop where there were supposed to be a coma in the book of Isaiah he pred acceptable year and he not say the year of venance the first coming of Jesus Christ was the sound of the trumpet of Jubilee and the prophet says in chapter 4 of The Book of Luke he was announcing a coming Jubilee and when did the Jubilee come he says it came on the day of Pentecost 50 days from the DAT of Ascension from the 50 days from the de of resurrection of Jesus Christ when Jesus rose from the dead he spent 40 days on the earth here showing by infallible [Music] proofs from the dead the 40th Day he ascended but he said in Jerusalem until we endured with power so they Ted for 10 days after the Ascension to make it 50 days after the resurrection so the day of Pentecost was the day of the Jubilee trumpet it was the day of the 50th it was the 50th day which was the day of Pentecost and the Holy Ghost came to give him a Jubilee May the name of the Lord be blessed and when the gospel is sounded that is the Jubilee trumpet now you don't have to wait for 50 days now you don't have to wait for 50 years every day when the scripture is preached that is the in of the T of Jubilee every scripture you read you have got a right on wrting it to drop down the hole and say Satan you can't touch me anymore I have heard the written and God has spoken to me this is the hour of my departure when the word is preached that is the hour of your departure from possession or oppression or oppression blessed be the name of the Lord and we know we know when a man went into Decay as the Bible says if you were poor and you lost your inheritance you had two options one of them if you could pay if you had a relative if you had if you had a close Redeemer if you had a close Kinsman who was rich he could pay for you he could redeem the thing not for himself but back to you you are not able to get back your property but a kidsman comes he gets it back not for himself but for you [Music] do you hear that that was number one way of redeeming your property then number two you were supposed to look at the calendar simply look at the calendar count the number of years count the 10th day of the seventh month there was a priest who go into every village every settlement with a trumpet he will Trum he will sound it when you heard it your freedom was because you have heard it your freedom was because you hat it not because you paid because there was a sounding of the Trum and when the tri sounded if the task master had told you to go up and tree to Pi a m of fruit for him take a m and when you were like stretching your head like this and you heard the trumpet it was now your grace to continue to pick it otherwise you could just come down the tree and say did you not hear that it sounded I'm no longer a slave from the sounding of the trumpet I'm no longer a slave and the Bible says when they will to return they would not go empty away because a 7th year it was a release of the Lord and the prophet says the jubile trumpet amen the return the return the return was not because of you it was not because of the man because it was according it says it was a Act of God it was a Act of God it was the act of God it was the act of God and you are going to go out not because you are righteous not because you are holy not because you can but it's an act of God that one is an amnesty every president has got the powers to issue a clency order amesty to say those that were convicted of such a crime and such a crime those that were sentenced to so many years the courts were right to find you guilty the evidence was right to prove you guilty and the sentence against you was correct but by the powers rested in me as the Commander in Chief I write a pattern and when a pattern is written whether you are guilty I not guilty it's time to go away amen yet there was evidence against you you were properly convicted you properly found guilty but the president has powers to say I paron you and pardon is not a pardon unless it is received and accepted as a pardon the triet of Jubilee is not a tri of Jubilee unless it is accepted as a tret of Jubilee behold I sent you Elijah behold I sent you the trumpet if you accept the trumpet you Exempted from Amon byass Amon because you have listened to a trumpet this Redemption Now by a Kingsman Redeemer was not for the Kinsman it was for the man who was poor that's why when Adam lost the book when he lost the book he went into destitution but one day a man came born of a v woman and died on the cross and he said it is finished he was paying the price the price of redemption that is not where we were redeemed that is not where the claims were made I want you to follow me amen he paid the price but you know if you go to a shop and you pay for your furniture it can remain there unless you come to take it to claim it but he paid the price to free the commodity to free the item but in chapter five of The Book of Revelation John was weeping and yet the price was paid already why was he weeping because what was redeemed had not yet been claimed it had just been paid for I want you to know when Jesus died on the cross yes he paid the price but he did not redeem the world because the book was not yet opened where he was going to claim the things for which he had paid the price John was weeping why he weeping and already died but there was need for a man to come and claim the contents of the book there was need for a man to come and open the book in order for you to see your inheritance your inheritance is not in the first pool it's not in the second pool it's in the fullness of the world and when you see your name you see your name of written in the book and the prophet says no man was Worthy open the book but yet Jesus Christ was busy interceding in the background he was interceding in the background clearing the names in the book your name was being cleared intercessor and John who was weeping he stopped not because the has prevailed not just to die on the cross but to claim has prevailed to open the book to lose the C there of then in chapter 10 what was closed in chapter 5 is now cut open in chapter 10 do you hear when Jesus Christ was in the temple and he opened the book he closed it and gave it back to the minister he closed it and gave it back to the minister but in chapter 10 when the book was opened it never went back to being closed it came down as an open book where you and I can see our names clearly and we now know that we are the sons and daughters of God not because we wanted but he chose us he elected us he prested us before the foundation of the world and what are we today we are an attribute of God being made manifest you are a part of God you were there before the foundation of the world you were shouting in the mind of God and you came down here to manifest him and what are we doing now we fellowshipping with the father we are fellowshipping with the father amen the bride is the part of Theos we are different from the Pentecostals they just believe in the blood but we have the token the life of the blood the b word is what saves us is what puts us in the Rapture glory to God the bleeding word is the Jesus of the message Jesus is not just a name Jesus is the word and we are the word made manifest because the word is a thought expressed the thought of God being expressed here cannot lose you without losing his thoughts because you are the thought of God you are the mind of God God can not lose you without losing his mind but the thoughts of God are Eternal is eternal as God is eternal you are can't be lost you can't be lost you came back you came from God you go back to God you have got the glory of the Father which you had with him before the foundation of the world you were in the logos you were in the mind of God as Jesus condescended you also condescended but you bypassed your you came from God you came from thought to flesh

I'm not reading this I'm just quoting it to you there was a brother called double I'm not reading it this double was a businessman and he was a contractor cont cont build things for government so he came to the prophet he says he wanted to build a post office but there was a man of God who told him don't take that contract because the Russians will come and run over it they will come through Canada to the US but and will clean the whole British Colombia out as they come down so don't take that contract the prophet says the prophet says I went and prayed and the brother had said oh brother Bram brother I needed that contract because I have no job he says what do I do now he says I am out of work but it was such a wonderful job this man went to the he had a contract that he wanted to to perform but he was told by another man don't take that contract but he came to Mal he says I am out of work so if I lose that contract it means I'm in trouble the prophet says I went out to pray and when I went to pray the angel of the Lord came and said go tell him say the Lord go on there because the men is wrong who told you not to take that contract the man is wrong and he said also speak to him this to tell his wife not Not To Doubt about having that baby the prophet had prophesied over this the man's wife years before to say you're going to have a child she was about 43 or so years old and she was told you're going to have a child and and many years passed about 8 years before many years passed and the brother was also out of a job it was a parness in his wife and a parness in the finances but the prophet spoke to the wife you shall have a child eight years later tell the man go and do that work and tell your wife not doubt that prophecy and the man went to have a job the point I'm trying to make is this if you are baren mothers who are here I give you a child if your husband is out of a job I give him a contract on the basis of the spoken word in Jesus name now the prophet says one time I I can't read you the court here he was he was he was designing and he said to another brother he said you brother you are looking for a job he says it is done he says to that other

what are you telling me about our God our God is able do the interpreters here I think I want to bless the interpreters now I am told I am told by somebody that when the prophet went to India and he did what he did in India you know what he did he says the driver who was driving him like our brother here and our brother Joshua who are driving us around the prophet said to him what is your need what do you want God to do for you to the driver and the man said come here I want you to go to the neighbor the neighbor has got a crippled son and I want you to to BU that's my the Prophet The Prophet I'm told he went there and this boy was sitting in the wheelchair all crippled up and the prophet there was a football there was a ball there and the prophet just kicked it towards the little

words he said and it shall be praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I just want to read you the words that he spoke andah theb who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said just a word as the Lord God of Israel live before whom I stand did he see a vision did he hear something I don't know but what I know he said before whom I stand there shall not be due nor rain these years according to my work he didn't say according to the word of God according to my word in flesh and did it come to pass and you know a prophet says and I and I also heard Pastor I quote those words some years ago the New Testament preacher is a prophet and everything we have heard here it has not been Idol talk elements have been moving things have literally taken place things have happened we are now going to begin to hear testimonies flooding let our pastors get ready testimony after testimony tell your neighbor testimony after testimony hallelujah amen if you have not been paying your ti oh that story has changed from today that has changed that has changed you will support the work of God when God prospers you it is not for you is for his name's glory amen we are not going to be Beggars we are going to be givers it is more blessed to give than to receive we are going to give to the work of God Amen we are going to support the work of God Amen Our Generation must leave for God we we should do exploits we should be ready for what God wants to use us for those have not been Idol words I did not know that it could be that way no wonder the devil tried to fight with power going off let me laugh a little bit Satan has not prevailed yes and he will never Prevail the word has been proclaimed like our Pastor said yesterday I have said it I cannot take it back what I have said I have said praise God oh my I don't know how many are feeling good like amen praise God I'm feeling so thrilled this afternoon feeling so thrilled with what is going to happen the pastors and the ministers that are here with us today just get ready these young people are going to be one of the great financiers of the [Music] project Elijah said it and it [Music] happened amen and I remember you know talking about speaking the word a sister when Pastor was giving a testimony of a sister who was following him in Ethiopia this was there was a very faithful sister and I know she might actually be streaming she did not have a job for a long time the Pentecostal ministers by the time we found her they had cheated all our money and she was bankrupt she didn't have anything but she she loved God so one day she came to my office crying said pastor this message is true surely God want me to live like this I am tired of this I want something to happen What can I do and in that atmosphere I do not know what to tell her do you just speak words of encouragement what do you do do you speak presumptuously is going to do something no you because it was a real moment for her and so I desire to know the mind of God and the Holy Spirit led me to that scripture can these Dry Bones live again son of speak can again and you know as as I was sharing that scripture with her faith rose up and when Faith rose up in the place where we I told her now let us pray she had stopped by this time crying and believing that God is going to and as we were praying right there Inspire to speak to her I said sister you are going to get a job it's going to be a big job in a good company and as as soon as I say those words I told her I do not know how long it will take but I know it is going to happen because it was spoken under of course as a man I doubted also like was that God but we've been told so don't doubt it took two weeks two weeks you know what a job came up um from America and they needed uh the head of a financial um it is like Western Union and uh there was no one qualified because you see they wanted someone who um has a financial background at least a degree also speak good English and so they tried to okay they brought it through other people in the church I did not know of it they even sent some CVS and those people were turned down I learned that they couldn't Express themselves well in English they turned them down and then the sister was still you know believing but as soon as I heard of that I told the brother who was handling this I said brother I can almost tell you right now that job I mentioned the name of the he said but the sister not she didn't have a degree she didn't have a diploma I think also she didn't have a certificate but she had been in Dubai and interacted with you know different people and out of that she had learned to speak English and she had quite a good spoken English and so that's all she had and then so the brother said okay I'll try and send her CV so they sent her CV and when they the first call they met to her they told her oh you are good welcome to the team the first [Music] interview and in the second interview so she the after the first interview she came back to be very excited God is doing it I said change change God has done it she said amen and you know Ethiopian people don't say Amen [Music] and so um you know after the second interview on the second interview this question how much do you want to the biggest amount she could think of in that moment she said it that I want to ear I think it was 10,000 b or something like about at that time maybe about three something million shs for someone who has no college degree and you know what they said no negotiation whatever she wanted to ear done and she got that job and supported financially the work whenever we had a problem in the church financial problem you know pastors know who to contact sister Juliet can help you know those people who God has blessed and you know they are also happy and they know where the source of Their Blessings are so if God blesses you you know the source of your blessings don't limit God with what you give him give abundantly and he will abundantly continue to God bless you God bless you amen so you might as well also tell God how much you want to earn how much you want to make in your bus let us stand and sing a song as we close this service let us tell pastor Manda God bless you God bless you him come on God bless you amen thank you sir I have received my house we have received our church land we oh hallelujah

ministering amen shall we bow our heads Lord we want to thank you like the song writer said it is done the great transaction is done father you cannot call us and then we Remain the way we are something has to happen and if something happens on the on the inside it must also show on the outside you said we shall be heads and Nots even the way we look even the way we talk must reflect what your word says about us these have not been presumptuous words I believe he has spoken them under anointing under inspiration and it will bring forth the purpose for which it has been made Lord we believe that you would come down on Earth and tell Peter go and open the fish the very first fish you get and take the money out of where did that money come from we do not know what power put it in who made that money it looked like it was minted by man but we know it came from the bank of Heaven I looked to the hills from Once cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord who made the heavens we shall be head we shall prosper we will leave for God Ser the Lord and we shall declare that our testimony came from the house of God that we are who we are because we say thank you Jesus thank you for sending Pastor our way thank you for using him Lord and for him to allow him you to use him Lord a lot of energy and strength as virtue has left him may you restore back and may he oh God also receive
