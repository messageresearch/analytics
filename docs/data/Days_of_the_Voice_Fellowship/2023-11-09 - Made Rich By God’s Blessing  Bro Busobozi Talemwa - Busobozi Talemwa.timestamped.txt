[19:11] Rich I can never be
[19:15] poor
[19:17] hallelujah amen now I want you to listen
[19:20] here in the Book of
[19:22] Genesis let us see where we get this
[19:24] idea
[19:26] from in Genesis CH 22 vers
[19:30] one I am going to read it only in
[19:32] English so if you you are if you want it
[19:35] in lugand read it in your
[19:40] Bible so listen to me because there are
[19:43] quite several verses and I want to
[19:45] keep there 18 verses so I want to read
[19:48] and you you follow
[19:50] me if you have the scripture you can put
[19:53] it up
[19:55] there and it came to pass after these
[19:58] things things that
[20:00] God did tempt Abraham and said unto him
[20:04] Abraham and he said behold here I am and
[20:06] he said take now thy son thy only son
[20:09] Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into
[20:12] the land of Moria and offer him here for
[20:15] there for a b offering upon uh one of
[20:18] the mountains which I will tell thee of
[20:20] and Abraham rose up Al in the morning
[20:23] and saddled his ass and took two of his
[20:25] younger men with him and Isaac his son
[20:28] and Cave the wood uh for the burn
[20:31] offering and Rose up and went unto the
[20:33] place which God had told him then on the
[20:37] third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[20:41] saw the place a far off and and Abraham
[20:44] said unto his young man abide ye here
[20:48] with the US and I and the Lord will go
[20:50] Yonder and worship and come again to you
[20:53] and Abraham took the wood of the B
[20:55] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[20:58] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[21:01] knife and they went uh both of them
[21:03] together and Isaac and spake unto
[21:06] Abraham his father and said my father
[21:10] and he said here am I my son and he said
[21:13] behold the fire and the wood but where
[21:17] is the Lamb for a burn offering and
[21:19] Abraham said my son God will provide
[21:23] himself a lamb for a bur
[21:26] offering so they went both both of them
[21:28] together and they came to a place which
[21:30] God had told him of and Abraham built an
[21:33] outter there and laid the wood in order
[21:36] and bound Isaac his son and laid him on
[21:39] the altar upon the wood and Abraham
[21:41] stretched forth his hand and took the
[21:43] knife to slay his son and the angel of
[21:46] the Lord called unto him out of heaven
[21:48] and said Abraham Abraham and he said
[21:51] here mine and he said lay not thy hand
[21:54] upon the Lord neither do thou anything
[21:57] unto him him for now I know that thou
[22:00] fearest God seeing that thou Hast not
[22:02] withheld thy son thy only son from me
[22:06] and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[22:08] looked and behold behind him a ram CAU
[22:11] in a Thicket by his thorns and Abraham
[22:13] went and took the RAM and offered him up
[22:16] for a burn offering in the stad of his
[22:18] son and Abraham called the name of the
[22:20] Lord the uh of that place Jehovah praise
[22:24] God as it is said to this day in the
[22:28] Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and
[22:30] the angel of the Lord called unto
[22:32] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[22:34] and said by myself I have sworn sayth
[22:38] the Lord for because thou Hast done this
[22:41] thing and Hast not withheld thy son thy
[22:43] only son that in blessing I Will Bless
[22:47] thee and in multiplying but I want to
[22:50] show you here that Israel is a nation
[22:54] that came out of
[22:56] Abraham and they also came out out of
[22:59] Isaac you see so they are they have a
[23:02] covenant this is the Covenant that God
[23:04] gave
[23:05] them that convenant of the blessing of
[23:08] God flows through that
[23:12] Lage you see they were blessed by God no
[23:15] man can cast them right now as I'm
[23:18] speaking to you Israel is being
[23:21] attacked from many
[23:24] corners is from Lebanon is
[23:26] attacking Hamas from Gaza is
[23:29] attack and other
[23:32] terrorists other nations that hate
[23:36] Israel and everybody is fighting against
[23:38] isra people are going to the streets all
[23:41] over the world by thousands and thousand
[23:45] demonstrating that we want you know
[23:47] Israel to seize the
[23:49] fire but do you realize the target of
[23:52] these
[23:54] people is to kill
[23:56] Israel
[23:58] wipe it out of the
[24:00] M their plan is not for them to live in
[24:03] peace their plan is for Israel to be
[24:06] wiped
[24:08] away but Israel is saying This Is Our
[24:11] Land God gave it to
[24:13] us we we will not leave we can live with
[24:17] the rest of the
[24:19] tribes as long as you allow us to live
[24:21] in peace with
[24:23] you but the others are saying no we will
[24:26] wipe you away
[24:28] Iran for example they saying the
[24:32] same they saying the same Israel must be
[24:35] wiped
[24:36] away they Israel with a
[24:40] passion but do you know what there is
[24:43] nothing they can do to destroy
[24:47] Israel and the Bible says pray for the
[24:50] Peace of
[24:52] Jerusalem every Bible
[24:55] lover every Jesus Lover
[24:58] must not only love Israel but they must
[25:01] pray for
[25:03] Israel and I tell you what Israel has a
[25:06] covenant with
[25:08] God and that Covenant cannot be
[25:12] removed is a covenant that started with
[25:15] with
[25:16] Abraham and it was given to Abraham and
[25:19] that it would follow through
[25:23] Isaac do you know where all these others
[25:26] came came from
[25:29] Hagar haar was a mistress of
[25:34] Abraham and ha got a son and that son
[25:39] was called
[25:41] is and he the he's the father of great
[25:45] grandfather all those Hamas
[25:50] and that is true it is historical
[25:55] isical Israel comes from the
[25:59] lineage of
[26:01] Isaac and God had given Abraham a
[26:06] promise and you know out of what
[26:09] happened because he told him listen to
[26:13] me he said now Abraham you remember
[26:17] Abraham at first never had a
[26:20] child and God promised him I will give
[26:24] you a son I will give you a son trust me
[26:28] believe me Abraham and Sarah believed
[26:33] God and God gave them a son and when
[26:37] Abra when when when ISAC
[26:39] arrived the child of the
[26:42] promise then God came back again and he
[26:45] said Abraham I know you believe me so
[26:50] here I have one more thing to say
[26:52] to give me your
[26:55] son your only son
[26:58] give him to me many times when we hold
[27:03] something we don't want to let
[27:05] go whatever you
[27:08] have whatever you have if it's not Jesus
[27:12] it is
[27:14] nothing it is
[27:16] nothing if you think you have
[27:18] knowledge it is nothing if you think you
[27:21] have wisdom it's nothing if you think
[27:23] you have money it is nothing it's all
[27:26] nothing without him
[27:28] all nothing without
[27:30] him and I can prove that to you by the
[27:33] Bible he is a rich man who came to Jesus
[27:38] and spoke to him and said my good Master
[27:41] what can I do inherit etal life Jesus
[27:45] told him go and do the
[27:48] law I have fulfilled The Works of the
[27:51] law from the time I was a
[27:55] child ah Jesus told him
[27:58] you have done well but there is one more
[28:01] thing go sell all your
[28:04] riches give it to the poor come follow
[28:08] me the rich man was sad he went side in
[28:14] his if you don't believe
[28:17] Jesus you will go a
[28:20] side I always say everybody that hears
[28:23] the gospel being
[28:26] preached and you don't believe it
[28:29] whether you believe it or not you can
[28:32] never be the same
[28:35] again if you if you don't believe it you
[28:39] will go
[28:40] away but if you believe it you will be
[28:44] happy you will be happy you will not
[28:47] only be happy you will also be
[28:52] rich now this Young
[28:54] Ruler he went side because he did not
[28:58] have
[28:59] Jesus the only thing he needed to do is
[29:03] what Jesus
[29:04] said sell
[29:07] everything and take and follow me oh are
[29:11] we ready to do
[29:12] that s
[29:14] everything and follow him we cannot
[29:17] trust anything else we only trust
[29:20] him sell everything and follow me and
[29:24] here then comes we go back to Abraham so
[29:27] then God comes back to
[29:29] Abraham and says now
[29:32] Abraham my friend I want your son give
[29:36] me your son your only
[29:39] son you must be willing to give up he
[29:42] said I will do whatever God
[29:45] says You must be willing to say I will
[29:48] do whatever God
[29:50] says as long as it is his word I will do
[29:54] whatever he says and Abraham said son
[29:58] come follow me he took some of his
[30:01] servants and together they went and the
[30:04] Bible tells me when Abraham reached a
[30:07] place he saw the place that God told
[30:14] him and he knew to he thought to himself
[30:18] there is no way he can go to that
[30:21] place with with these people who are not
[30:23] in the
[30:25] convenant so he looked back
[30:28] and he told all his
[30:29] servants please stay
[30:32] here with the
[30:34] donkeys me and my son are going up on
[30:37] the
[30:38] hill
[30:41] toship the Bible says he that will not
[30:45] leave his mother and father and brother
[30:46] and sister and blah blah blah blah
[30:49] blah is not worthy of me sometimes
[30:52] people want to believe the
[30:54] message they want baptize in the name of
[30:56] our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:58] but they fear what mama will say what
[31:01] papa will say me my mother was my mother
[31:04] disowned
[31:05] me because of this
[31:07] truth but after some years right now as
[31:11] I'm speaking to you I am her
[31:16] pastor for three years for three years
[31:21] she couldn't look at me I couldn't look
[31:22] at
[31:23] her because of this truth if you lose if
[31:27] you save your life you lose
[31:28] it but if you lose your life you will
[31:31] save
[31:32] it and Abraham looked at the servants
[31:36] and told them stay with
[31:38] the oh I love my mom I believe in
[31:41] obeying a
[31:42] parent but when it comes to the word I
[31:46] obeying the
[31:47] word so even me at that time I told my
[31:52] mama I told my brothers I told my
[31:54] sisters stay with the donkeys
[31:58] as for me I am going up on the
[32:01] mountain I am going to worship God I'm
[32:05] going to believe every word of
[32:08] God maybe if you have a friend who
[32:11] doesn't want you to believe the word you
[32:14] have a girlfriend or a boyfriend who is
[32:18] nagging you all the time doesn't want
[32:20] you to believe the word you must be able
[32:23] to tell them stay with the
[32:26] donkeys with a donkey as for me I am
[32:30] going on the mountain I am going on the
[32:33] mountain to Worship the
[32:37] Lord hallelujah hallelujah and then we
[32:40] find you know that they stayed with the
[32:43] donkeys didn't know what was going to
[32:45] take place on the
[32:46] mountain but guess what Abraham went on
[32:50] the mountain with his son Isaac and when
[32:53] they arrived there Abraham Isaac
[32:56] realized
[32:58] there is something missing his father
[33:00] had told
[33:03] him that we cannot
[33:06] worship without an
[33:09] offering so if you come to
[33:11] church come with an
[33:14] offering don't come
[33:17] empty-handed come with an
[33:19] offering are you hearing
[33:21] me it's a way of
[33:25] worship and first offering is your
[33:29] broken
[33:29] heart your contrite
[33:32] spirit you must be willing to submit
[33:36] yourself to the word of
[33:37] God whatever he says I will believe it
[33:41] and then now you can talk about the
[33:43] money now here they didn't have an
[33:46] offering so the he knew
[33:49] somehow God is able to provide a
[33:53] sacrifice do what God is word
[33:55] say will do the
[33:58] rest God will do the
[34:01] rest God will do the
[34:03] rest
[34:06] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise
[34:10] God praise God will always show
[34:14] up will always show up and when they
[34:18] arrived there you know
[34:20] he Abraham put in his
[34:23] eort fear
[34:25] not don't fear anything at all don't
[34:29] fear anything at all because the
[34:32] blessing of God gives wisdom the
[34:36] blessing of God brings
[34:39] remembrance the blessing of God will
[34:42] give you what you
