[1:10:13] sat on the throne, a book written within
[1:10:15] and on the backside, sealed with seven
[1:10:18] seals. And I saw a strong angel
[1:10:20] proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is
[1:10:23] worthy to open the book and to lose the
[1:10:25] seals thereof?" And no man in heaven nor
[1:10:28] in earth, neither under the earth, was
[1:10:30] able to open the book, neither to look
[1:10:32] there on.
[1:10:58] [Music]
[1:11:04] And one of the elders said unto me, weep
[1:11:06] not, behold, the lion of the tribe of
[1:11:08] Judah, the root of David, has prevailed
[1:11:09] to open the book and to lose the seven
[1:11:11] seals thereof.

[1:11:36] the four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:11:38] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:11:41] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:11:44] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:11:47] into all the earth. And he came and uh
[1:11:49] to me, he came and took the book out of
[1:11:54] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:11:56] throne.
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:22] And when he had taken the book, the four
[1:12:24] beasts and the four and 20 elders fell
[1:12:26] down before the lamb, having every one
[1:12:28] of them hs and golden vials full of
[1:12:31] orders, which are the prayers of the
[1:12:32] saints. And they sung a new song,
[1:12:34] saying, Thou art worthy to take the book
[1:12:37] and to open the seals thereof. For thou
[1:12:40] was slain and hast redeemed us to God by
[1:12:43] the blood out of every kindred and
[1:12:46] tongue and people and nation and hast
[1:12:48] made us unto our God, kings and priests,

[1:15:26] don't know if we can be able to
[1:15:34] Okay, I'll just search it out and I know
[1:15:37] I'll get it fast.
[1:15:53] Mhm.
[1:15:54] Now friends,
[1:15:58] um,
[1:15:59] you know, I u
[1:16:06] I'm finding the the right words or the
[1:16:08] best words.
[1:16:11] Um, I thank God for this message.
[1:16:16] uh the entire message which we believe
[1:16:20] um because it's a special message.
[1:16:25] Amen.
[1:16:26] Um I um personally I came from Anglican
[1:16:30] church
[1:16:33] and in the Anglican church I thought
[1:16:36] that I knew what I knew that I knew too
[1:16:39] much.
[1:16:43] But I realized I knew nothing when I
[1:16:45] came into this mess
[1:16:48] and there is no way absolutely
[1:16:51] I can be able to return where I came
[1:16:54] from.
[1:16:56] because of what I know today.
[1:16:59] And to those of you who are in Roman
[1:17:00] Catholicism,
[1:17:03] when you came out, you realized,
[1:17:06] there was a a higher revelation you had
[1:17:09] gotten to.
[1:17:13] Uh you remember the brother I told you
[1:17:15] that I met in uh in uh uh Path in the
[1:17:18] city of Path.
[1:17:21] He told me everything you preached.
[1:17:24] is a brother actually. He follows
[1:17:26] Apostle Grace here.
[1:17:29] He told me, "Oh, you know, I've been
[1:17:32] following TB Joshua.
[1:17:34] When he died, I started following Kaki
[1:17:38] then, but now I'm following Apostle
[1:17:41] Grace and I'm following his ministry
[1:17:44] somehow from Uganda."
[1:17:47] I said, "All right." And I invited him
[1:17:50] to church. So when he came in church and
[1:17:53] he sat and heard the word, of course in
[1:17:56] the me churches we preach the message of
[1:17:57] him.
[1:18:00] He told me
[1:18:03] now everything you are preaching I could
[1:18:05] tell it was the truth.
[1:18:08] Much of it I I already had in my system.
[1:18:13] But there are other things you have said
[1:18:16] that I feel I it is an upgrade to what I
[1:18:21] already have in my system
[1:18:27] and my computer system. My computer
[1:18:30] talking about is spiritual system needs
[1:18:32] an upgrade of with what you have
[1:18:35] computer system.
[1:18:40] All these denominations
[1:18:43] They have so much light
[1:18:47] but they fall short somewhere.
[1:18:50] They fall short. And you see it's been
[1:18:53] in seasons.
[1:18:55] It has been you know right from the
[1:18:57] first church age.
[1:18:59] God has the church of Jesus has been
[1:19:01] progressing
[1:19:04] coming into maturity.
[1:19:08] But that's why you you know the the the
[1:19:10] angry angry will tell the Catholic
[1:19:14] I have father light.
[1:19:18] The Methodist will tell the angry I have
[1:19:22] father light.
[1:19:25] The Pentecostal will tell everybody else
[1:19:28] I have father life.
[1:19:31] And then you have the oneness
[1:19:33] Pentecostals
[1:19:35] the Jesus only they will tell all the
[1:19:39] other Pentecostals and all the other
[1:19:41] denominations.
[1:19:43] We have father light
[1:19:46] and every one of those is right.
[1:19:50] But the light they have
[1:19:53] cannot be any other light apart from
[1:19:55] what God had shined in their life.
[1:20:00] It was God who shined in their day.
[1:20:05] But you know the problem they
[1:20:08] denominated.
[1:20:10] They built a camp.
[1:20:13] Man has always wanted to denominate.
[1:20:18] You know it's just in man. They always
[1:20:22] want to denominate.
[1:20:25] When they denominate,
[1:20:27] they die.
[1:20:29] God leaves them and he continues without
[1:20:34] because you cannot denominate God.
[1:20:38] You cannot organize God and lock
[1:20:40] himself.
[1:20:44] All those denominations
[1:20:46] are saying ours is the truth.
[1:20:50] We are the right ones.
[1:20:52] They are right according to the
[1:20:55] revelation they had in their day.
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:21:01] And the Holy Spirit moved on.
[1:21:05] Where is the Holy Spirit today?
[1:21:08] The Holy Spirit is not in any
[1:21:11] denomination.
[1:21:15] He has moved on. He's calling a people
[1:21:20] with an end time message
[1:21:23] to come out from denominations
[1:21:27] to come out from church systems,
[1:21:31] to come out from religion and be united
[1:21:36] again with the bridegroom Christ.
[1:21:42] And he is using what we are calling the
[1:21:44] end time message.
[1:21:50] people. The problem with people, they
[1:21:51] always wanted to denominate.
[1:21:55] You remember when he when when the
[1:21:57] presence of God came down on the
[1:21:58] mountain,
[1:22:00] the disciples saw that
[1:22:03] it was Peter, Luke, and John.
[1:22:06] And they said,
[1:22:09] "We have a suggestion
[1:22:11] because God is here and we have realized
[1:22:14] who you are. Let us make a three tents.
[1:22:19] Let us make a three denomination.
[1:22:22] We build one here, one there, one.
[1:22:25] And that's what they have always done.
[1:22:28] And how do you know the characteristics
[1:22:30] of a denomination
[1:22:37] will say
[1:22:41] this here
[1:22:44] in the right church
[1:22:48] what I'm talking about today
[1:22:50] is very important
[1:22:53] you are seeing what is happening in the
[1:22:55] world the rapture is about to happen.
[1:23:00] Open your eyes.
[1:23:04] You know when I came back
[1:23:07] when I went to Australia,
[1:23:09] I'll tell you one thing that really
[1:23:11] impacted me.
[1:23:14] I I travel many places
[1:23:16] and I have many times you realize you
[1:23:19] you had an inspiration that you preached
[1:23:20] on before.
[1:23:23] So I'll preach about it again.
[1:23:26] But when I went among some of these
[1:23:28] brothers,
[1:23:30] I could not preach the inspirations I
[1:23:32] had
[1:23:34] before
[1:23:36] I had preached to you.
[1:23:39] And I found out the reason
[1:23:41] is because these brothers are so deeply
[1:23:44] rooted in the word
[1:23:47] in the word of this day,
[1:23:50] in the message of the hour. And I said
[1:23:53] to myself,
[1:23:56] so I went to God in prayer to give me an
[1:23:59] inspiration
[1:24:01] to preach among them. He gave it to me
[1:24:03] and this is where I've been preaching
[1:24:04] since Sunday
[1:24:06] and it will be for a while. I mean
[1:24:09] different titles. It is the same thing.
[1:24:12] I want us to understand something.
[1:24:15] For so long
[1:24:18] preachers in the message
[1:24:20] are preaching what Pentecostals can even
[1:24:24] preach better.
[1:24:31] That is the truth.
[1:24:34] If I come to you and I preach to you
[1:24:35] faith,
[1:24:38] Kenneth Copeland and TD J can do it.
[1:24:44] If I preach to you healing
[1:24:47] and I make my ministry all around
[1:24:49] healing,
[1:24:52] I'm not saying it's not of God. It is of
[1:24:55] God. But I want you to understand. There
[1:24:58] are others from other revivals before
[1:25:01] our generation
[1:25:04] who can actually do it better
[1:25:08] because that's what they had for their
[1:25:10] people.
[1:25:13] But you see, revelation is progressing.
[1:25:18] God in our day is not coming for an
[1:25:22] imperfect church.
[1:25:26] He is coming for a perfect bride.
[1:25:32] So we need the church needs to grow unto
[1:25:38] the deeper things of God.
[1:25:42] Paul said, "When I was a child, I acted
[1:25:45] as a child.
[1:25:48] But when he grew, he did not act as a
[1:25:51] child anymore."
[1:25:53] We see fed them milk, but when they
[1:25:56] grow,
[1:25:57] they start eating the meat of the word.
[1:26:01] How many want the milk only?
[1:26:04] It is time for the church to mature.
[1:26:08] It is time for us to begin eating the
[1:26:10] meat of the world.
[1:26:15] Real meat, tangible,
[1:26:18] something which will re which will make
[1:26:20] you grow muscles
[1:26:24] and which will make you realize who you
[1:26:25] are.
[1:26:28] Milk can only help you at a certain
[1:26:31] stage.
[1:26:33] You have grown at a certain stage.
[1:26:37] You now not only need the milk,
[1:26:41] you need the milk plus the meat.
[1:26:45] So we are not leaving the foundation.
[1:26:49] We need all that.
[1:26:51] But we need to have the building
[1:26:54] finished
[1:26:56] on Wednesdays. Those of you who missed
[1:26:58] Wednesday, go back and listen to the on
[1:26:59] Wednesday.
[1:27:01] There are many things I said on that
[1:27:02] regard
[1:27:04] and I will not go back. And here he says
[1:27:07] the book is not revealed until the
[1:27:09] church ages and denominational ages has
[1:27:11] run out.
[1:27:17] He's talking about this seven sealed
[1:27:19] book
[1:27:21] until all the ages has run out
[1:27:24] and there is no time no more.
[1:27:26] It's only revealed after church ages and
[1:27:28] denominational ages has run out.
[1:27:34] That's the reason the thing is in in
[1:27:37] such a scrapper tonight.
[1:27:41] They pick up a little doctrine
[1:27:45] and they run off here on one side
[1:27:48] and they say, "This is it. Another one
[1:27:52] picks up another doctrine
[1:27:56] and runs off this side." And he said,
[1:27:59] "This is it." and the church and each
[1:28:02] one builds a denomination under it.
[1:28:12] For us, we major on miracles.
[1:28:16] Here we speak on the inner man. Here we
[1:28:19] speak on faith.
[1:28:31] You go to such a church, you can hear
[1:28:32] all names of demons.
[1:28:36] They know them
[1:28:40] and all demon possessed people go there.
[1:28:45] There are very many things you can
[1:28:48] everybody say.
[1:28:52] We are holding this. We are holding
[1:28:54] that.
[1:28:58] picks a certain doctrine.
[1:29:02] This church is a prophetic church. That
[1:29:04] is why
[1:29:07] we only give prophecy.
[1:29:09] And you know they do they record
[1:29:11] themselves
[1:29:12] and then they they they say oh major
[1:29:15] prophecy
[1:29:17] and afterwards they say oh yeah no
[1:29:20] prophet matches our prophet.
[1:29:23] Another one makes another ministry.
[1:29:25] And this inspires people.
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:29] You know, even when you you you you feel
[1:29:31] you are so weak.
[1:29:34] You go there and you you you by the time
[1:29:36] you come out,
[1:29:38] you feel you can carry the whole county,
[1:29:42] you are very strong.
[1:29:44] But as soon as you reach home, you
[1:29:47] forget everything.
[1:29:50] Why? Because these things
[1:29:54] are not the message of the hour.
[1:29:57] They do not have the power
[1:30:00] to bring about the change of your body.
[1:30:07] And these denominations have built their
[1:30:09] entire denominations on these things.
[1:30:15] And each one builds a denomination under
[1:30:17] it.
[1:30:20] until we have hundreds of
[1:30:27] way
[1:30:30] for them. and can pray for four to five
[1:30:32] hours without keeping quiet.
[1:30:42] Now when you go to such a church,
[1:30:46] you really see if you don't do that, you
[1:30:49] don't have heaven.
[1:30:53] Others they fast for 40 days.
[1:30:56] Listen brother,
[1:30:58] they build their lives. They build their
[1:31:02] miss
[1:31:03] on such a thing.
[1:31:07] The message of the hour we preach
[1:31:11] goes beyond all those.
[1:31:14] It goes beyond all those you meet
[1:31:17] others.
[1:31:20] They are only centered on the Holy
[1:31:23] Spirit
[1:31:25] and the gifts of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:29] center around that
[1:31:32] without progressing.
[1:31:36] But when you know the message of the
[1:31:37] hour, you will know.
[1:31:41] You don't need to remain in one.
[1:31:44] You need to grow
[1:31:47] progress
[1:31:49] and you reach a level where you know who
[1:31:51] you are. What power you have?
[1:31:56] What time are you in?
[1:31:59] What promises
[1:32:00] are in the world are you supposed to
[1:32:03] fulfill?
[1:32:05] That is the message of this hour.
[1:32:09] Now listen, but still in all of it we
[1:32:13] see confusion
[1:32:15] the people are wondering
[1:32:18] what is truth
[1:32:20] and he says if that is the isn't the
[1:32:22] condition today
[1:32:25] indeed that's the condition today.
[1:32:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But then he
[1:32:30] promises that when that time has
[1:32:34] finished out
[1:32:36] there will be the sounding of the
[1:32:38] seventh angel's message
[1:32:44] at the finishing
[1:32:46] of the time of the church ages.
[1:32:50] Amen. There would be the sounding
[1:32:53] of the seventh angel
[1:32:55] message.
[1:33:00] Okay, are you following me? Put put here
[1:33:02] Revelation 10:7. It is right there.
[1:33:06] And then the book
[1:33:09] will be revealed
[1:33:11] at that time.
[1:33:14] Listen,
[1:33:16] the lamb opened the book,
[1:33:20] but the book remained obscure
[1:33:25] until the time of the sounding
[1:33:30] of the seventh angel's message.
[1:33:35] Oh my good Lord. So there would be a
[1:33:37] time
[1:33:39] Amen. Amen. There would be a time when
[1:33:43] there will be at the seventh angel
[1:33:49] and the seventh angel's message
[1:33:53] the work his work will be revealing the
[1:33:57] seven seals.
[1:34:02] His work will be different from all what
[1:34:06] the others have done.
[1:34:10] He will tie all the loose ends through
[1:34:12] the church.
[1:34:17] Are you following me? Follow me. Just
[1:34:19] follow me. You see
[1:34:22] people when they when you don't
[1:34:24] understand
[1:34:26] the message that you believe the day you
[1:34:28] are living in. It is easy for you to go
[1:34:31] back to the denomination.
[1:34:34] But no man, no woman that has understood
[1:34:38] the mystery of the day,
[1:34:41] the message of the hour
[1:34:44] can go back to the denomination.
[1:34:49] No one can. It is impossible.
[1:34:53] It is impossible. Yesterday I met a
[1:34:56] friend of mine.
[1:34:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I was with him
[1:35:01] through school.
[1:35:02] preached to him the message. He believed
[1:35:05] he got baptized. But just before he
[1:35:07] could get deeper into the message
[1:35:10] where he might even be streaming, I
[1:35:11] don't know, he went overseas.
[1:35:15] So as he was overseas,
[1:35:18] he he um you know joined Fero there
[1:35:22] and so he now returned and so I sat down
[1:35:26] with him yesterday and I told him so
[1:35:28] tell me oh um what what's happening you
[1:35:32] no longer believe the message quite
[1:35:34] frankly I have never understood deeply
[1:35:37] what the message is all about
[1:35:41] but since I have been in Fero
[1:35:44] there are Many things I have learned
[1:35:46] that I never knew.
[1:35:49] And I told him, you are right only
[1:35:52] because that there is some light there.
[1:35:56] And I told him, even if you are sincere
[1:35:59] and you go to the Anglican church,
[1:36:02] you will rece.
[1:36:06] But if you've been in Fero and you go to
[1:36:08] Anglican church, you may think you're
[1:36:09] wasting your time
[1:36:12] because Fero has father
[1:36:16] compared to the other denomination.
[1:36:18] Are you understanding what I'm talking
[1:36:19] about? And then I told him but see
[1:36:22] brother there is more light.
[1:36:26] You see what you have learned? I can
[1:36:28] tell you something that we have a
[1:36:31] message in our day that is actually more
[1:36:34] like
[1:36:36] than what you have. He said for real. He
[1:36:40] said but I have been comfortable where I
[1:36:42] have been.
[1:36:44] And I told him this. I said let me tell
[1:36:46] you something. If you are in a basement
[1:36:51] and there is a a light switched on
[1:36:55] and and someone tells you come I take
[1:36:58] you there is father light outside
[1:37:03] and then you say no I'm comfortable here
[1:37:06] I am not in darkness
[1:37:09] I have light
[1:37:11] where you are right you have light where
[1:37:14] you are
[1:37:16] but that light is from electricity
[1:37:20] It is not a natural light.
[1:37:22] Every time it will go off.
[1:37:26] But but if you have revelation,
[1:37:28] you will say, "Take me, let me see this,
[1:37:32] father."
[1:37:34] And when you go out,
[1:37:36] you Oh my my
[1:37:44] understand what I'm preaching. You can't
[1:37:46] see further lie.
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:48] When you stay in one place,
[1:37:51] you can't see father
[1:37:53] when you remain in your denomination.
[1:37:55] You can't see father. If you don't go
[1:37:58] out, you have to go out. And when you go
[1:38:02] out, then you will see
[1:38:06] you will rejoice at the power.
[1:38:09] And let me tell you one more thing. You
[1:38:11] cannot go back in the best
[1:38:15] when you see father.
[1:38:18] You cannot go back in.
[1:38:20] Some of you, some of us, we were in a
[1:38:23] basement. We were in a makeshift light.
[1:38:28] But now we have seen the light.
[1:38:31] The light has shined
[1:38:33] in darkness.
[1:38:35] And we have seen the light. And we have
[1:38:38] become the light.
[1:38:40] Oh Lord. Amen. That's why sisters, you
[1:38:44] no longer dress
[1:38:47] the way you used to dress. You no longer
[1:38:49] behave, brother,
[1:38:51] the way you used to behave. What
[1:38:54] happened to you? You receive father
[1:38:56] life.
[1:38:59] Father light
[1:39:01] more than the light you have. This is a
[1:39:04] natural life.
[1:39:06] can never go out
[1:39:08] until the day is done.
[1:39:11] And the day will not be done
[1:39:14] until the rapture comes.
[1:39:17] Hallelujah. Amen. That's when the day
[1:39:19] will be.
[1:39:20] We are in a new day.
[1:39:23] We have new light.
[1:39:25] Oh, father light.
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:31] Amen. If you've not seen it, don't
[1:39:34] worry. You'll see it.
[1:39:36] I met a brother.
[1:39:39] Amen. In a city of Melbourne.
[1:39:42] He's a good brother. He's a a Kenyan
[1:39:45] brother. He came from Kenya. And he went
[1:39:48] to to to Australia.
[1:39:51] And he met me and gave me his testimony.
[1:39:55] I was trying to remember his name. I
[1:39:56] can't remember his name right now. But
[1:39:59] he's a wonderful brother. And he told
[1:40:01] me, "Pastor,
[1:40:04] when I was in Kenya,
[1:40:05] I was in a message church,
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:09] but I had not seen the light yet.
[1:40:14] I had not yet seen the light
[1:40:18] because he was born in the message.
[1:40:23] There are many of you born in families
[1:40:26] that believe the message.
[1:40:28] The reason why you are the way you are
[1:40:32] is because you have not seen this.
[1:40:36] But sister
[1:40:39] when you see this life
[1:40:41] something that happened to your father
[1:40:45] there something will happen
[1:40:49] this man he changed atmosphere
[1:40:53] he went to uh Australia and of course he
[1:40:56] was in all these things drinking smoking
[1:41:00] even weed
[1:41:02] he was into all of
[1:41:04] women, everything.
[1:41:07] But he said when he arrived to
[1:41:09] Australia,
[1:41:11] you know, if he came in this church and
[1:41:14] you know, you know, because he was used
[1:41:16] where he came from
[1:41:19] these people,
[1:41:21] father, mother church, it's a family
[1:41:23] church.
[1:41:26] That's why children of preachers are in
[1:41:27] a danger.
[1:41:31] Children of believers are in danger.
[1:41:34] Hey,
[1:41:39] you rather have a child
[1:41:42] that believes and come to.
[1:41:46] But those called by believers,
[1:41:49] they need to be prayed for a Lord.
[1:41:53] I'm talking about my children I have.
[1:41:56] They need prayer
[1:41:59] because they don't know what you're
[1:42:00] talking about.
[1:42:02] They still had a family religion
[1:42:06] sometimes. No wonder
[1:42:10] parents need to leave those churches
[1:42:14] to go into other message churches.
[1:42:21] I was telling my wife
[1:42:24] one of my daughters if she grows
[1:42:28] and say she wants to go to another
[1:42:29] church
[1:42:31] I won't stop her
[1:42:36] you want to have your children in the
[1:42:38] church feel good
[1:42:41] but if they don't understand what you
[1:42:43] say
[1:42:45] as a family
[1:42:49] change and go under
[1:42:52] God can reveal
[1:42:54] and they will see the light.
[1:42:58] The same man
[1:43:01] said when he went to this church he was
[1:43:02] hearing new things
[1:43:05] but I noticed the same things I used to
[1:43:06] teach
[1:43:08] but to him it was new things. It was
[1:43:11] like someone was reaching out to him
[1:43:16] and he said, "I saw the light, brother.
[1:43:19] I saw the light. I gave up my life
[1:43:23] and and I surrender to Jesus. And from
[1:43:26] that day, I have been new. Things are
[1:43:29] changed. Threw away the alcohol, threw
[1:43:32] away the trials. I love the women
[1:43:37] in the Lord. God, I love this message. I
[1:43:40] said God bless you. I told him I saw the
[1:43:43] light.
[1:43:45] Many of you have seen the light
[1:43:47] and some of you have not seen the light.
[1:43:51] Rather seek the light.
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:43:57] You have to know where you came from.
[1:44:00] You have to know who you are.
[1:44:02] This message is not another
[1:44:04] denomination.
[1:44:06] And by preaching this message, we are
[1:44:09] not saying all the others don't have the
[1:44:12] truth.
[1:44:14] No, all the others
[1:44:17] have some truth.
[1:44:21] Some of them have a lot of truth
[1:44:24] and especially the Pentecostal
[1:44:25] preachers.
[1:44:27] Many of them are actually reading the
[1:44:30] message
[1:44:33] directly. They are reading the message.
[1:44:39] I was thinking whether I should tell you
[1:44:40] this story or not.
[1:44:43] I think I'll tell you without mentioning
[1:44:44] names.
[1:44:46] There's a a pastor friend of mine from
[1:44:48] the UK.
[1:44:51] He told me there's this very popular
[1:44:53] preacher.
[1:44:55] He keeps talking about brother Bam in a
[1:44:57] positive way.
[1:45:00] He told me he went to him and he said
[1:45:03] brother
[1:45:06] uh
[1:45:08] why don't you believe the messenger
[1:45:11] and he told him who is a message
[1:45:13] believer
[1:45:16] this popular
[1:45:17] all of you know him if I mention
[1:45:20] this popular preacher was the one asking
[1:45:24] who is the belief of the message
[1:45:27] the one who believes the message brother
[1:45:28] Bannon preached Listen to me. Yes.
[1:45:32] He he picked up his iPad
[1:45:37] and he showed him.
[1:45:39] What is this? What is this?
[1:45:43] Is it not the message?
[1:45:45] He told him, "I believe it from 1947
[1:45:50] to 1965
[1:45:52] and I read it every day."
[1:45:58] He's a Pentecostal preacher.
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:03] He believes the message,
[1:46:05] but he can't he be like us. Brother
[1:46:08] Banham said he can't quote like that.
[1:46:13] I read you let me
[1:46:17] do that. You have to understand why. Not
[1:46:20] because the things are not correct, but
[1:46:24] because if he does that, he will lose
[1:46:27] the association of other pastors.
[1:46:32] And there's no way he can claim publicly
[1:46:35] he believes this and he quotes it when
[1:46:37] he is not telling the people
[1:46:44] to change their ways and believe
[1:46:45] according to the
[1:46:48] all the women will live.
[1:46:53] his church will become small
[1:46:55] and money will become small.
[1:46:58] And these kind of preachers love money.
[1:47:01] The pump and the big things.
[1:47:04] Imagine if you're a pastor of 10,000
[1:47:10] and you preach this and you you announce
[1:47:13] from today I am believing this message
[1:47:16] and I believe women should not dress
[1:47:18] this because that's what the Bible say
[1:47:21] and I believe men should behave like
[1:47:23] this church should be like this if you
[1:47:26] speak in tongues there should be
[1:47:28] interpretation
[1:47:30] you begin putting the church in
[1:47:32] according to the message
[1:47:34] You must be baptized again in the name
[1:47:36] of our Lord Jesus Christ in much water
[1:47:39] because the first water baptism was not
[1:47:42] according to the Bible.
[1:47:45] If you begin to tell people these
[1:47:47] things,
[1:47:48] they will walk away.
[1:47:51] Who wants that?
[1:47:53] Not even me.
[1:47:57] If half of you leave,
[1:48:01] I may pretend I'm not feeling it.
[1:48:04] But I can feel so bad. Every preacher
[1:48:06] does
[1:48:08] because a shepherd is is a shepherd of
[1:48:10] the sheep.
[1:48:12] You want them to come. You don't want
[1:48:14] them to go away. Sometimes you say go
[1:48:16] away, but that's when you are under the
[1:48:19] anointing.
[1:48:20] You really don't want anyone to come.
[1:48:24] That's the fact.
[1:48:26] And then you see that it has happened
[1:48:28] before in Kenya.
[1:48:31] a brother who had a huge church,
[1:48:34] 5,000 people,
[1:48:36] pastor,
[1:48:38] 5,000.
[1:48:40] He believed this message. He announced
[1:48:43] half the church left.
[1:48:46] He almost had a heart attack.
[1:48:50] But he stood. He got baptized again and
[1:48:53] the whole church that remained.
[1:48:56] Brethren, I tell you it is this is the
[1:48:59] hard way.
[1:49:03] This is the hard way. You see so many
[1:49:05] people who claim to believe Jesus. They
[1:49:09] came to believe the Bible, but their
[1:49:11] life does not match
[1:49:14] and they look like they are blessed by
[1:49:16] God.
[1:49:18] They are in the wide way.
[1:49:20] But this is the narrow way.
[1:49:24] Amen.
[1:49:26] Now I've not started my sermon this
[1:49:28] morning. I was just speaking a few of my
[1:49:31] convictions.
[1:49:33] So let's um get into the message now
[1:49:37] and see how much we will go.
[1:49:41] Maybe I will speak to you for another 30
[1:49:43] minutes
[1:49:45] and then I will continue on on on Sunday
[1:49:48] next
[1:49:50] on Wednesday. Brother Shem is going to
[1:49:51] be speaking to us.
[1:49:54] So uh there's a lot I have to say
[1:49:58] but we only lack time.
[1:50:00] Now Revelation 5
[1:50:04] um here there are many things I can read
[1:50:06] about. I'm just going to dwell on verses
[1:50:09] 9 today.
[1:50:12] But we see the Bible here the scene is
[1:50:14] opening when John is saying he he saw in
[1:50:18] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:50:20] throne a book written within and on the
[1:50:21] back side.
[1:50:28] And this book was sealed with seven
[1:50:30] seals.
[1:50:32] I and he says, "And I saw a strong angel
[1:50:36] proclaiming with a loud voice.
[1:50:40] Who is worthy
[1:50:42] to open the book and to lose the seals
[1:50:45] there?
[1:50:48] No man in heaven,
[1:50:50] nor in earth, neither under the earth
[1:50:55] was able to open the nether to look
[1:50:58] their own. And now the Bible says, "And
[1:51:01] I wept much."
[1:51:04] You see why is John weeping?
[1:51:08] John is weeping because of one reason.
[1:51:12] No one is worthy to open them.
[1:51:15] And he knew because there is no one
[1:51:17] worthy
[1:51:19] and these seals are not open.
[1:51:23] The entire human race was in
[1:51:27] the seed of God was in.
[1:51:31] Are you following me now? If the book is
[1:51:34] not open,
[1:51:36] the seals are not broken
[1:51:40] seed of God
[1:51:43] is in trouble.
[1:51:45] Which means the devil has won
[1:51:47] which means the devil has taken over.
[1:51:50] There would be nothing like redemption
[1:51:53] because this seven sealed book
[1:51:56] is a book of redemption.
[1:51:59] Man had fallen,
[1:52:01] fallen from the glory of God, fallen
[1:52:04] from the image of God.
[1:52:06] Man needed to be restored.
[1:52:10] Man had fallen away.
[1:52:12] Brother puts it this way. He was on the
[1:52:14] other side on the other end of the
[1:52:16] cousin.
[1:52:20] Here is a cousin.
[1:52:23] This side is death, is sin, is
[1:52:29] uncleanness,
[1:52:31] inability,
[1:52:32] failure, sickness, trouble. And this is
[1:52:36] where we are all born.
[1:52:39] But there's another end of the
[1:52:43] perfection, holiness of God, sons of
[1:52:47] God, image of God, impossibility is made
[1:52:52] possible.
[1:52:54] There is no impossibility.
[1:52:57] Are you hearing me? Power, healing,
[1:53:00] miracles. Are you hearing me? This is on
[1:53:03] the other side. And here was John in the
[1:53:07] flesh, knowing he's also on this side.
[1:53:12] Every man that is born of a woman is on
[1:53:14] this side.
[1:53:16] And when he saw the book of redemption,
[1:53:20] this seven sealed book in the hand of
[1:53:23] him that sat on the throne. Who is it?
[1:53:28] This is God himself.
[1:53:30] Amen. Because you know who was the owner
[1:53:33] of this book?
[1:53:35] That was Adam. Listen to me now. Brother
[1:53:39] calls it titled.
[1:53:46] This book is a title.
[1:53:49] Adam lost it
[1:53:51] the moment they sinned in the Garden of
[1:53:53] Eden.
[1:53:56] But you see, he says it could not go in
[1:53:59] the filthy hands of Sat.
[1:54:06] Are you not so glad brother that your
[1:54:09] title did the devil cannot crazy?
[1:54:13] The devil has no power.
[1:54:17] Why? It could not go into his hand
[1:54:21] because he's a filthy devil.
[1:54:24] He has no power over what doesn't
[1:54:27] belong.
[1:54:29] He is only a squatter.
[1:54:32] He has no title deed.
[1:54:36] The title deed belongs to you. Belongs
[1:54:41] to you. Oh, glory to God. Amen. I have
[1:54:45] the title D. It belongs to me. Follow me
[1:54:49] closely. Amen. You know, no one was
[1:54:54] worthy. But that title D even if no one
[1:54:58] was worthy,
[1:55:00] the devil never possessed it.
[1:55:05] What is the title deed? The seven seal
[1:55:08] book. What is the seven book? The book
[1:55:11] of redemption. What is it? The abstract
[1:55:14] title deed.
[1:55:18] The devil couldn't have it.
[1:55:22] Amen. You may be in sin, but you are not
[1:55:26] owned by Satan.
[1:55:29] You may be born in sin,
[1:55:32] but the devil does not own you.
[1:55:36] Sin may touch your body,
[1:55:39] but the devil doesn't own your soul.
[1:55:43] That's why he told Job,
[1:55:46] you know, John Satan, he's all right.
[1:55:50] You cannot touch his body.
[1:55:52] Do not touch his soul.
[1:55:57] Amen. You remember that song. You know
[1:56:00] you can touch my body. You can kill my
[1:56:03] spirit. My soul
[1:56:07] but my soul.
[1:56:09] Hallelujah. Amen. But my soul is in his
[1:56:13] hand.
[1:56:14] The devil cannot kill your soul.
[1:56:20] He can torment your spirit but he
[1:56:22] doesn't own your soul.
[1:56:25] God has a title.
[1:56:28] God has authority
[1:56:30] and he told him you know do not touch
[1:56:34] his soul
[1:56:35] that you can go do everything you want
[1:56:37] to
[1:56:39] but in all that trouble.
[1:56:41] You know Job never cast God.
[1:56:46] No matter what you are going through.
[1:56:49] Amen. If you are se of God, if you are
[1:56:53] fall,
[1:56:56] you cannot cast.
[1:56:59] [Applause]
[1:57:01] The devil may bring you poverty.
[1:57:03] You may be frustrated, but you can't
[1:57:06] cast God.
[1:57:08] You may be sick. You may have an
[1:57:10] infirmity, but you can cast God.
[1:57:15] You may be tormented in your body, in
[1:57:19] your spirit, but you can't cast God.
[1:57:22] Why? There is a seed of God in you.
[1:57:27] Amen. Why? Because you are fornown
[1:57:31] for a knowledge
[1:57:34] point to what? Because you are fornown
[1:57:39] you were predestinated.
[1:57:43] Why predestinated
[1:57:46] to be conformed
[1:57:49] to the image?
[1:57:51] Remember the castle.
[1:57:55] You were predestinated. You are here.
[1:57:57] But before you are here, you are
[1:57:59] predestinated
[1:58:01] to be conformed to the image of son.
[1:58:08] This side
[1:58:10] that's where you belong.
[1:58:12] You need to be redeemed.
[1:58:15] Amen. Amen. And for someone to come,
[1:58:21] Amen. and they say they can redeem you,
[1:58:23] no man can redeem you. No man can come.
[1:58:28] You are already cast
[1:58:30] by unbelief.
[1:58:32] At the moment you believe
[1:58:35] by choice and decision.
[1:58:38] Amen.
[1:58:40] You are passed from death unto life.
[1:58:44] No more cast has power.
[1:58:49] Hallelujah. You have crossed the castle
[1:58:51] already.
[1:58:53] And the blood of Jesus
[1:58:55] atones for all your sins.
[1:59:01] Amen. See the book went into the hand of
[1:59:04] the original owner
[1:59:07] and here is God having a book in his
[1:59:10] right hand
[1:59:13] who is worthy who can take the book
[1:59:17] who can take the title
[1:59:19] and redeem back fallen man
[1:59:23] who the other side of the castle and
[1:59:25] bring him back to where he belong. bring
[1:59:29] him back to his true identity.
[1:59:34] Who is worthy? No man was worthy. No
[1:59:37] angel was worthy. For all have sinned
[1:59:41] and have come short of the glory of God.
[1:59:44] No one was worthy.
[1:59:46] And when John saw that, he knew what
[1:59:50] this meant.
[1:59:52] He knew that everyone is doomed.
[1:59:58] And John began weeping.
[2:00:00] John began weeping.
[2:00:04] Because there was no one.
[2:00:08] But as John was weeping,
[2:00:10] oh my
[2:00:13] I wish I have time. I wanted to go to
[2:00:14] verse 9.
[2:00:16] But as John was weeping,
[2:00:19] one of the elders,
[2:00:22] everybody tell your neighbor, one of the
[2:00:24] elders.
[2:00:26] Amen. One of the elders said unto John,
[2:00:32] Amen.
[2:00:34] Where is that? Vers. And one of the
[2:00:37] elders said unto me, weep not
[2:00:41] weep not. Now, how many elders were
[2:00:44] there?
[2:00:46] 24 elders.
[2:00:48] 12 New Testament.
[2:00:51] 12 Old Testament.
[2:00:53] Amen. Are you following me? John, was he
[2:00:56] one of the elders?
[2:00:58] Oh, yes. He was one of the disciples.
[2:01:01] So, John was one of the elders of the of
[2:01:04] the of the of the New Testament. Are you
[2:01:07] following me?
[2:01:09] So, who which el spoke to John?
[2:01:14] Come on, message me church.
[2:01:17] Which elder spoke to John?
[2:01:20] Was John one of the elders?
[2:01:23] So which which elder spoke to John?
[2:01:26] I can tell you something. He must have
[2:01:28] been an elder.
[2:01:30] Identical to John.
[2:01:33] [Applause]
[2:01:35] Hallelujah.
[2:01:36] Hallelujah. John spoke to John.
[2:01:42] What are you talking about?
[2:01:44] What happened here? It was a revelation
[2:01:49] that struck John.
[2:01:51] Hallelujah. Amen. As he was weeping very
[2:01:54] hard from Ethiop.
[2:02:02] Let me tell you, you may be struggling
[2:02:04] with something.
[2:02:06] But there is something else. There is
[2:02:09] another body,
[2:02:11] a word body that you have. And when you
[2:02:16] hear the word, you hear from your
[2:02:18] thoughts
[2:02:21] speaks to you every day encourages you
[2:02:24] everything. You know what? You know what
[2:02:27] David, you know you can make it. You
[2:02:30] will go through you overcome the what is
[2:02:34] happening. John spoke to John.
[2:02:38] Weep not. Amen. And he said the lion
[2:02:43] of the tribe of Judah.
[2:02:46] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:02:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Where did the
[2:02:52] revelation come from?
[2:02:54] Remember I told you when we beginning
[2:02:56] this service that revelation
[2:02:59] is the biggest thing we should pray for.
[2:03:05] When you have revelation
[2:03:07] of who Jesus Christ is, you have
[2:03:09] received a revelation of who you are.
[2:03:14] John received a revelation
[2:03:18] on who was going to take the
[2:03:23] automatically
[2:03:24] by by that revelation which had come to
[2:03:27] him.
[2:03:29] He had received a revelation
[2:03:31] of who he was.
[2:03:36] Did you get it? Yes.
[2:03:41] He could no longer weep.
[2:03:44] Hallelujah. Because he had known who he
[2:03:46] is.
[2:03:48] So why do I weep?
[2:03:51] Let me even wipe the tears. Why do I
[2:03:53] weep?
[2:03:55] Why was he not weeping?
[2:03:57] Come to him. How did it come to him?
[2:04:01] There was no angel speaking to him.
[2:04:04] there was not able to speak to him. It
[2:04:06] was a revelation which had come
[2:04:09] the same way came to Peter.
[2:04:13] The same came to Peter and he said thou
[2:04:18] at Christ the son of the living. What
[2:04:22] was that revelation?
[2:04:25] There was no one speaking
[2:04:27] but it was a revelation.
[2:04:30] Amen. that he had received from God
[2:04:32] right from within him and the same thing
[2:04:35] here is happening.
[2:04:37] Amen. Weep not John for the lion of the
[2:04:40] tribe of John
[2:04:42] prevailed.
[2:04:44] Jesus told Peter flesh and blood I
[2:04:47] revealed this to you but my father in
[2:04:49] heaven.
[2:04:51] Did Peter go to heaven?
[2:04:54] Heaven had come down.
[2:04:56] Amen.
[2:05:00] When all of us will get this revelation,
[2:05:03] the rapture will go
[2:05:07] heaven and come down. And from that
[2:05:09] moment on, Peter could no longer weep.
[2:05:13] He had received the revelation of who
[2:05:15] Jesus Christ is. John by revelation had
[2:05:18] received the revelation.
[2:05:20] Oh, who is going to take the book?
[2:05:24] Let me tell you something. Something you
[2:05:25] may not know by this time Jesus had
[2:05:29] already died on the cross.
[2:05:34] So why was John weeping?
[2:05:36] Lack of revelation.
[2:05:40] Hallelujah. I feel so good this morning.
[2:05:43] Lack of revelation.
[2:05:45] Why are you weeping? Because of your
[2:05:48] condition.
[2:05:50] Lack of revelation.
[2:05:52] You don't have a revelation on who Jesus
[2:05:55] Christ is and who you are.
[2:05:58] That's the only reason why you are with
[2:06:00] him.
[2:06:02] John who had been with Jesus who had
[2:06:05] testified about him.
[2:06:07] And when he saw the book and no one was
[2:06:09] worthy, he cried. Why do we would he
[2:06:13] cry? He would have known there was one
[2:06:16] worthy who had already come and died and
[2:06:20] and and and and shed his blood
[2:06:23] and breached the cas.
[2:06:29] He would have already received that
[2:06:30] revelation.
[2:06:31] But he had no revelation. But when the
[2:06:33] revelation struck from that moment on
[2:06:37] John stopped weeping.
[2:06:39] Weep not John for the lion. This is how
[2:06:43] we receive the revelation
[2:06:45] for the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[2:06:49] prevailed to turn
[2:06:52] and to reveal to open a seal.
[2:06:55] Are you following me now? John wanting
[2:06:59] to know
[2:07:01] and to see the lion
[2:07:04] that had come to him through that voice.
[2:07:08] He turned to see
[2:07:11] Remember
[2:07:14] whatever you were seeing was in a
[2:07:16] vision,
[2:07:18] not physically there.
[2:07:21] You could see John, but John was not
[2:07:24] there where you thought he was.
[2:07:28] John was working in the realm of
[2:07:30] revelation,
[2:07:32] in the realm of visions
[2:07:35] like us today. The Bible says we are in
[2:07:38] heavenly places.
[2:07:41] When you go in Christ,
[2:07:44] there is a place a hidden place where
[2:07:47] the devil cannot join you.
[2:07:52] Hallelujah. And that is the Sabbath
[2:07:54] rest.
[2:07:56] John was in the Lord's day.
[2:07:59] The Lord's day is Sabbath.
[2:08:01] That means the Holy Ghost
[2:08:04] to the Holy Ghost. The devil can't find
[2:08:07] you. rather hide yourself there.
[2:08:11] Hide yourself there. The devil can't
[2:08:14] find you. And while you in the Holy
[2:08:16] Ghost, revelations will begin to pass.
[2:08:19] Visions of rapture
[2:08:22] bast
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:26] bring for
[2:08:32] whispers of love.
[2:08:36] You now know that song.
[2:08:38] You know, now know that song was
[2:08:40] inspired. That song was inspired.
[2:08:44] You now know that. That's what it means.
[2:08:47] Sometimes we sing the songs and we don't
[2:08:48] understand
[2:08:50] walking in heavenly places. And and as
[2:08:53] John was walking there,
[2:08:55] he turned to see someone might have seen
[2:08:58] him turn.
[2:09:00] What is wrong with John? Remember they
[2:09:02] took him on that island to die,
[2:09:06] but he began to bust.
[2:09:10] The devil might think he placed you in
[2:09:11] that place to die
[2:09:15] right in the middle of your trial.
[2:09:18] If you a son or daughter,
[2:09:21] the devil cannot destroy you.
[2:09:24] But the devil rides on fear.
[2:09:28] And when the angel comes down,
[2:09:31] The first thing you say, "Fear not.
[2:09:34] Don't fear not. Don't fear not. Don't
[2:09:37] fear not. Don't fear." Tell your
[2:09:39] neighbor, "Fear not. Do not fear. Don't
[2:09:42] fear what a devil can do. Do not fear.
[2:09:46] Don't fear what a devil can bring
[2:09:48] because he can't touch you.
[2:09:50] You are in another dimension. You are in
[2:09:53] another realm. You are in a heavenly
[2:09:55] place.
[2:09:57] You are a priest of God. You are the
[2:09:59] king of God.
[2:10:01] Hallelujah. Amen. You are king with God.
[2:10:05] The devil cannot destroy.
[2:10:07] And John did not fear. It was a very
[2:10:11] poisonous island,
[2:10:14] but he was there busting into
[2:10:16] revelation.
[2:10:18] Think about it.
[2:10:21] Hallelujah. May God help me to bust into
[2:10:24] revelation.
[2:10:26] When I have no money in my pocket,
[2:10:29] I can begin
[2:10:31] to pray. He speak in tongue and I b into
[2:10:35] revelation.
[2:10:37] Bing to revelation. And when I see
[2:10:39] revelation, what do I see? I see myself
[2:10:42] blessed. If I need a house for my
[2:10:45] children, I see a home built.
[2:10:49] I I need a church for my for the
[2:10:52] brethren,
[2:10:54] I see a church built.
[2:10:56] on a land that we are collecting money
[2:10:58] for. But I see the church build.
[2:11:03] When you b into revelation, these are
[2:11:06] the things you begin to see.
[2:11:08] If you need marriage,
[2:11:10] you begin to see yourself on your
[2:11:11] wedding day.
[2:11:19] So people will see you in the church,
[2:11:22] others are praying for you are doing
[2:11:24] this.
[2:11:26] What's happening? You are seeing what
[2:11:29] others are not seeing.
[2:11:32] You're on your wedding day.
[2:11:35] Oh, I want God to help us to binge.
[2:11:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. If you
[2:11:44] want a baby,
[2:11:46] Amen. They may say you are crazy.
[2:11:50] Oh, brother Bam talks about Abraham,
[2:11:53] how he went to buy clothes and you know
[2:11:54] these other things.
[2:11:57] The doll is for your children.
[2:11:59] They said, "Papa, what's wrong with
[2:12:01] you?"
[2:12:05] But he was seeing revelations.
[2:12:08] Revelation brings action.
[2:12:12] So if you a mother and you are a baby,
[2:12:15] hallelujah, amen, you can even lose your
[2:12:18] mind.
[2:12:19] Amen. Come to a place where you begin to
[2:12:21] play with your baby. Come on, Junior.
[2:12:24] Don't disturb them.
[2:12:27] What's happening? They can't understand.
[2:12:30] But you are saying
[2:12:32] to them, you're crazy. To you, you are
[2:12:35] seeing a real
[2:12:37] in another world.
[2:12:40] Hallelujah. Amen. That's what I'm
[2:12:42] talking about. Basting into revelation
[2:12:45] where you have nothing to feed your
[2:12:47] children.
[2:12:49] where your husband tells you you go back
[2:12:52] to that church
[2:12:55] your marriage is lost
[2:13:00] and then you go to prayer when you go in
[2:13:02] prayer you pass into revelation you
[2:13:05] begin seeing yourself
[2:13:07] in love with your husband
[2:13:10] and he's saying oh darling I love you
[2:13:12] please go to church so you come to
[2:13:18] But darling, you allowed me to go to
[2:13:20] church.
[2:13:22] Where they allow you? I told you don't
[2:13:25] go to church.
[2:13:28] Are you crazy?
[2:13:30] Of course, you'll be crazy.
[2:13:33] But when you are in the spirit,
[2:13:36] you cannot be crazy.
[2:13:39] When God shows you a vision
[2:13:41] and you just act out the vision,
[2:13:46] You just act it out.
[2:13:49] Brother raised the dead. He never just
[2:13:52] went who where's the dead? Rise up. He
[2:13:56] first saw a vision
[2:13:59] and then he went to act it.
[2:14:02] We are actors
[2:14:04] of a finished work.
[2:14:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And
[2:14:12] John when he turned to see what did he
[2:14:15] see? He saw a lamb.
[2:14:19] You would think a lion is the one that
[2:14:21] is worthy.
[2:14:24] But when John turned to see, he saw a
[2:14:27] lamb.
[2:14:28] The lamb he already knew.
[2:14:31] The lamb had already touched the lamb
[2:14:33] that he had already been.
[2:14:36] So,
[2:14:40] from before the foundation,
[2:14:45] which means all those that the lamb died
[2:14:49] for,
[2:14:51] it was before they were born.
[2:14:55] It was before there was a world.
[2:14:58] Some land Pentecostal babies.
[2:15:04] And I say that because we are mature
[2:15:06] Pentecost.
[2:15:10] We I mean those who are mature.
[2:15:13] But there are Pentecostal babies who are
[2:15:16] un
[2:15:18] praying like this. Oh father come here
[2:15:21] brother.
[2:15:24] Oh father let brother's name here be
[2:15:29] remove
[2:15:30] from the book of death.
[2:15:32] Let it be written in the book of life.
[2:15:36] Go brother
[2:15:38] those kind of prayers
[2:15:41] for unlanded Pentecost.
[2:15:46] Why they have not
[2:15:50] they have not received the revelation
[2:15:54] of the seals.
[2:15:56] When you are preaching from an open
[2:15:59] book,
[2:16:01] there are prayers you can't pray.
[2:16:04] There are places you can't go. There are
[2:16:06] things you can't do. Why? Because you
[2:16:10] are preaching from an open eye.
[2:16:13] But when the book is closed,
[2:16:15] you are seeing through a glass dark.
[2:16:20] You do what everybody does. After all,
[2:16:22] Bishop, Reverend Dr.
[2:16:26] But now here we see there is a book
[2:16:31] and he says when I saw the lamb
[2:16:35] was slain
[2:16:38] before the foundation of the world.
[2:16:43] If he was slain before the foundation of
[2:16:45] the world,
[2:16:47] it means he redeemed those names before
[2:16:49] the foundation of the world.
[2:16:54] It means It means, are you ready for it?
[2:16:58] It means you were saved
[2:17:03] before you were born, brother.
[2:17:06] [Applause]
[2:17:09] I know where I'm standing. Just follow.
[2:17:10] Just follow.
[2:17:13] You were redeemed
[2:17:15] before you came into your mother's womb.
[2:17:21] So why do we preach the gospel?
[2:17:25] Because when you were born,
[2:17:27] you were in the other side of the
[2:17:29] country
[2:17:31] and you had your eyes blinded
[2:17:36] by the circumstances around.
[2:17:40] You had spiritual amnesia.
[2:17:45] So when the gospel is coming,
[2:17:48] you come to yourself,
[2:17:51] your eyes are open, you realize who you
[2:17:54] are. I'm a son of God.
[2:17:58] And then you begin saying many
[2:18:05] earrings.
[2:18:08] Bye-bye.
[2:18:12] Bye-bye,
[2:18:14] brothers. You begin saying
[2:18:18] bye-bye
[2:18:20] prostitutes. Bye-bye.
[2:18:22] I'm going to marry one wife. I'm going
[2:18:24] to live as a son of God. I'm going to
[2:18:26] serve God.
[2:18:28] Bye-bye.
[2:18:30] What happens? You have realized who you
[2:18:33] are.
[2:18:35] Hallelujah.
[2:18:38] That is the result
[2:18:41] of the opening of the seal book.
[2:18:48] Amen. You realize you are the redeemed
[2:18:50] of the Lord.
[2:18:52] You realize, Amen. You are not of the
[2:18:55] lost.
[2:18:56] You are not of those from certain.
[2:18:59] You realize you are a person.
[2:19:03] Amen. This world is not worthy of it.
[2:19:09] Doesn't the Bible say you are a peculiar
[2:19:12] people,
[2:19:14] a holy nation, you are royal priesthood.
[2:19:17] Amen. Amen. That's what the Bible say.
[2:19:21] But we just read those things and we go
[2:19:23] on
[2:19:25] because you have no revenge. And when
[2:19:27] you if you can stop and say why did he
[2:19:30] say I am a person the world is not
[2:19:33] worthy of
[2:19:35] I'm a priest and a king.
[2:19:38] I'm a peculiar person. I am a holy
[2:19:40] nation.
[2:19:42] Hallelujah. Am I preaching to someone?
[2:19:45] You realize
[2:19:47] you are not what your father said you
[2:19:49] are.
[2:19:52] [Applause]
[2:19:54] Stupid foolish girl. You realize that's
[2:19:57] not who you are.
[2:20:00] You realize you are not even a in a a
[2:20:04] denominational person.
[2:20:07] You are not controlled by any man. You
[2:20:10] are controlled by the Holy Ghost.
[2:20:13] Some say if you leave this church,
[2:20:16] your blessings are remaining.
[2:20:21] But then you realize your blessings are
[2:20:23] not with me.
[2:20:26] Your blessings are in the word
[2:20:30] with Christ
[2:20:32] in knowing who you are.
[2:20:36] Your blessings are there.
[2:20:40] So the lamb that was red that there was
[2:20:44] strength for the world.
[2:20:48] Amen.
[2:20:49] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:20:53] Amen. And he prevailed and and and to
[2:20:56] lose the seven seals there.
[2:20:59] When he died at the cross, lose the
[2:21:02] seals.
[2:21:04] Can we say amen to that
[2:21:08] and and I beheld and low
[2:21:11] in the midst of the throne
[2:21:14] and of the four beasts and the mid of
[2:21:17] the elders.
[2:21:18] Praise the name of the Lord. Stood a
[2:21:21] lamb
[2:21:22] as it have been slain
[2:21:25] having seven horns
[2:21:28] and having seven eyes.
[2:21:31] Amen. On the lamp,
[2:21:34] what is there? Seven church agents
[2:21:38] and the messengers there.
[2:21:41] It's all in him. We sing a song. It's in
[2:21:44] you, oh Lord.
[2:21:50] You you know in revelation 3 you find a
[2:21:53] candlestick
[2:21:56] and you know stars
[2:21:58] on the right in the right hand of the
[2:22:01] son of man and he was in the middle of
[2:22:03] the candlestick
[2:22:06] is the same verse here that is speaking
[2:22:07] of the lamb he's the one in the midst of
[2:22:11] the church
[2:22:14] the church is the candlestick
[2:22:17] is the strength of the lamb.
[2:22:20] The horns is what
[2:22:22] any animal uses to fight.
[2:22:27] Amen. And I will tell you what is the
[2:22:29] strength of the animal. The strength of
[2:22:31] Christ, the strength of the lamb
[2:22:35] is you the church.
[2:22:39] You are his strength on earth.
[2:22:41] Amen. are the messengers, seven eyes.
[2:22:46] Amen. I see an eye.
[2:22:49] Throughout the ages,
[2:22:51] in every age, there has been a
[2:22:53] messenger. And you know what? There is
[2:22:56] no way the devil can come from when God
[2:23:00] is not seeing him
[2:23:02] because he has seven eyes,
[2:23:06] seven church ages. What does he have?
[2:23:09] Seven messengers anointed
[2:23:12] to see.
[2:23:14] They don't only now they see a lot when
[2:23:17] they see the enemy and they warn the
[2:23:20] bride where the enemy is coming from.
[2:23:28] Second, what do I see? They see the word
[2:23:32] and they break the word
[2:23:34] to the church.
[2:23:37] They are seers.
[2:23:38] Seers are prophets.
[2:23:41] And he came and took up took the book
[2:23:43] out of the right hand of him that sat
[2:23:44] upon the throne.
[2:23:48] And when he had taken the book, the four
[2:23:51] beasts and the 20ers fell down
[2:23:56] having every one of them hed and goss
[2:23:58] full of
[2:24:00] which are the prayers of the saints. And
[2:24:02] here I'm I was just trying to rush
[2:24:04] through to come to this. And they sang a
[2:24:06] new song.
[2:24:10] Let me stop right there.
[2:24:12] Amen. Because the lamb has taken
[2:24:16] and lamb has lost.
[2:24:19] Amen. We cannot sing an old song.
[2:24:23] We have a new song to sing.
[2:24:26] Tell your neighbor. Tell your neighbor
[2:24:29] you have a new song to sing.
[2:24:33] Amen. We can no longer sing the same old
[2:24:35] song.
[2:24:37] Things are difficult.
[2:24:39] I am dying. I'm getting crazy.
[2:24:43] The world is finishing me. You have a
[2:24:46] new song, brother. I am redeemed.
[2:24:50] I am chosen. I am prevailing over Satan.
[2:24:54] I'm overcoming my sickness. I'm
[2:24:56] overcoming my trouble. I am more than a
[2:24:59] conqueror. I am a child of God. I am not
[2:25:02] going in a rapture and I'm redeemed. I
[2:25:06] have a vision of who I am. I am not a
[2:25:09] failure. I am an overcomer. You are
[2:25:13] singing a new song.
[2:25:16] I am a bride of Christ. I am no longer
[2:25:19] anomination.
[2:25:21] Amen. I am a royal priesthood. I am a
[2:25:25] holy nation. Come on church. We have a
[2:25:29] lot of things we can do.
[2:25:31] [Applause]
[2:25:32] The Bible says, "Is there someone Mary
[2:25:37] sing?"
[2:25:39] Why shouldn't we be happy when the lamb
[2:25:42] has taken and the lamb has lost?
[2:25:55] Why shouldn't we be happy?
[2:25:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why shouldn't
[2:26:00] you be happy
[2:26:01] and you see beyond what you see?
[2:26:07] Hallelujah. Why shouldn't you be happy?
[2:26:10] Your enemy the moment the seals are
[2:26:13] losed.
[2:26:16] Your enemy is no longer.
[2:26:19] Why should that you be happy?
[2:26:23] The seals were open.
[2:26:27] But it has to be revealed to you
[2:26:29] personally.
[2:26:33] If it is revealed to you, then you
[2:26:37] realize who you are. Why shouldn't you
[2:26:40] be happy? When you realize who you are,
[2:26:43] a son of God
[2:26:46] with the authority as good as what God
[2:26:49] has,
[2:26:51] you have no power. But you have
[2:26:53] authority.
[2:26:55] A little a little small police officer
[2:27:00] has no power.
[2:27:02] Even you brother can go and kick him or
[2:27:05] kick her down.
[2:27:07] But she has authority
[2:27:09] will stand before a very huge
[2:27:17] Sharon. Sharon come up here. You just
[2:27:20] met seven years.
[2:27:22] So you can help me preach today.
[2:27:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I wanted to
[2:27:26] imagine a police officer like this
[2:27:30] and you are coming
[2:27:32] brothers some four people come.
[2:27:35] I want I want to demonstrate this to you
[2:27:38] so you can see it. Some big big fat
[2:27:41] people.
[2:27:43] Uhhuh. Extend the other side like go in
[2:27:46] a row. Go in a row. Go in a line. Go in
[2:27:48] a line.
[2:27:50] Behind behind. Right now they're going
[2:27:52] to move. When they begin moving,
[2:27:54] you raise your hand like this. Raise. I
[2:27:57] see how you raise it.
[2:27:59] No, not like that. Like this like a
[2:28:02] police officer on the road. You have to
[2:28:06] be like don't feel you. You have
[2:28:08] authority. I have allowed you. I'm
[2:28:11] I'm now your government.
[2:28:14] No one will touch you. I'm protecting
[2:28:15] you. So don't fear the eyes. Just raise
[2:28:19] your hand with a lot of force. So when
[2:28:22] they coming you will do that under.
[2:28:25] Okay. So when they has authority if you
[2:28:28] don't stop you will receive.
[2:28:32] Come on. You have to stop them if you
[2:28:34] want. You see?
[2:28:37] What is that? Authority. Does she have
[2:28:40] the power
[2:28:42] this one man can carry her and throw her
[2:28:45] in the air?
[2:28:47] But she has authority. I know who is why
[2:28:50] just someone backing you.
[2:28:53] God bless you brothers. God bless you
[2:28:55] sisters. The bride when you realize who
[2:28:58] you are when you know you are redeemed.
[2:29:03] Hallelujah.
[2:29:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Authority has been
[2:29:08] restored to you.
[2:29:11] [Applause]
[2:29:13] Amen. And you have a guarant.
[2:29:17] He's right behind you. No one can touch
[2:29:20] you. No one can do anything to you
[2:29:23] because he is the redeemer of your soul.
[2:29:27] The kings man redeemer. He also the
[2:29:30] kings man avenger.
[2:29:34] Let me tell you he's the protector of
[2:29:37] our ted.
[2:29:40] Hallelujah. And when he redeemed it,
[2:29:44] amen, what did he do? He brought it back
[2:29:46] to you.
[2:29:49] He gave you your true identity.
[2:29:53] Now you on the other side of the cage.
[2:29:56] You are no longer of the of the ones who
[2:29:57] are getting lost.
[2:30:00] You are no longer of those in sudden
[2:30:01] Aiden.
[2:30:03] You are redeemed. To be redeemed means
[2:30:06] you have never sinned in the first
[2:30:07] place.
[2:30:12] You are perfect in the other side.
[2:30:15] So you have authority
[2:30:17] to stop
[2:30:19] anything you want to stop.
[2:30:21] You have authority to speak
[2:30:25] a word by a revelation and inspiration
[2:30:30] and it will happen.
[2:30:33] I've not had time to read for you all
[2:30:35] these quotes,
[2:30:37] but I have a bunch of them here
[2:30:40] that I would have wanted to read for
[2:30:42] you,
[2:30:43] but I've not read anything.
[2:30:46] And that's okay. I will not going to
[2:30:48] read him because time is finished. But I
[2:30:50] want to tell you friends,
[2:30:52] you have authority.
[2:30:55] You're restored back
[2:30:58] to who you were before the fall.
[2:31:03] What Adam lost,
[2:31:05] Amen is now yours.
[2:31:08] You can now say Jesus
[2:31:10] is mine. Why? Because you have the same
[2:31:14] authority.
[2:31:16] Even your sins
[2:31:18] are gone,
[2:31:20] completely gone. Because it speaks of
[2:31:22] the bleach.
[2:31:25] The the the bleach. You know, if you
[2:31:27] take an ink,
[2:31:30] this is one of the quotes I wanted to
[2:31:31] read for you. If you take an ink
[2:31:34] and you throw it into the bleach,
[2:31:40] the ink will disappear.
[2:31:45] Completely. You cannot trace it back.
[2:31:50] It has disappeared.
[2:31:52] That is what the bleach
[2:31:55] can do.
[2:31:57] Bleach
[2:31:59] has power, chemical power, natural power
[2:32:04] to completely erase
[2:32:07] a a stain and the stain will be gone
[2:32:11] permanently.
[2:32:14] It's is an acid turn back completely.
[2:32:20] And now we see brother Bam quotes and
[2:32:22] talks about Abraham. Brother Moses, he
[2:32:26] says Moses was under the blood of bulls
[2:32:29] and goats
[2:32:32] as a bleach
[2:32:34] to cover their sins. But you know what?
[2:32:38] Moses was told by God he could command
[2:32:42] flies to to appear
[2:32:46] and flies appear.
[2:32:48] Frogs and frogs appear. God never spoke
[2:32:52] them.
[2:32:54] Moses spoke them into existence.
[2:32:58] Moses turned water into blood.
[2:33:02] But remember, Moses was under the power
[2:33:06] of the bleach of the blood of boots and
[2:33:08] garments.
[2:33:14] And yet his word
[2:33:17] was made good.
[2:33:20] Because Moses was given authority by
[2:33:21] God.
[2:33:24] Moses had known what who he is.
[2:33:29] Even when he was still under the blood
[2:33:31] of
[2:33:34] how much more us
[2:33:37] who are under the blood
[2:33:41] of the redeemer,
[2:33:46] the one who was worthy.
[2:33:48] The one who took the book, the one who
[2:33:51] lose the sins, he is our redeemer.
[2:33:55] His name is Jesus Christ
[2:33:59] and what he did. Amen. His blood is the
[2:34:03] bleach
[2:34:08] that we all sins
[2:34:11] there and they are remembered no more.
[2:34:16] We are restored. By the power of this
[2:34:18] blood,
[2:34:20] at this point we can speak anything.
[2:34:24] The authority we have is more than what
[2:34:27] Mo Moses had.
[2:34:31] The church of the New Testament is the
[2:34:33] reality of the shadow of the Old
[2:34:36] Testament.
[2:34:42] We can speak things into existence.
[2:34:45] We are sons of God.
[2:34:48] Let me read just a portion as I
[2:34:51] when he he crossed he separated his
[2:34:53] sunship. He's a sinner by nature. He's
[2:34:55] under this the hands of a dominion of
[2:34:57] Satan
[2:35:00] beside him
[2:35:03] and God took a sacrifice
[2:35:06] a chemical of the blood.
[2:35:09] But the blood of bulls and goats
[2:35:13] they did not divorce sin.
[2:35:17] It only covers sin. If I've got a red
[2:35:20] spot on my hand
[2:35:23] and cover it with white,
[2:35:26] the red spot is still there.
[2:35:30] It is still there. But God sent down
[2:35:35] from heaven a bleach for sin.
[2:35:39] It was the blood
[2:35:41] of his own son.
[2:35:44] that when our confessed sins drops into
[2:35:47] God's bleach,
[2:35:54] try to find it again.
[2:35:59] Find those sins.
[2:36:02] Where are they?
[2:36:04] Where are they?
[2:36:06] Hallelujah.
[2:36:11] Let me ask you again. Where are they?
[2:36:19] [Music]
[2:36:20] As far as removed as darkness is from
[2:36:24] God
[2:36:26] in the sea of forgetfulness.
[2:36:31] It's good enough for me.
[2:36:34] Praise God.
[2:36:36] My sins are gone. Hallelujah.
[2:36:39] Yes, sir. I have I hope I I wish I could
[2:36:42] hear many hallelujah.
[2:36:46] The coloring of seeing God's back
[2:36:48] through the mediators
[2:36:53] down through the time
[2:36:56] until
[2:37:03] this good one. until
[2:37:07] it goes all the way.
[2:37:09] Oh my, you are going to love this one.
[2:37:12] And it heals the accuser
[2:37:16] [Applause]
[2:37:24] and he lays on him
[2:37:31] until the day of judgment.
[2:37:38] Yes sir. Hallelujah. Amen. It goes back.
[2:37:42] Why? Because of the bleach of the blood
[2:37:44] of Jesus.
[2:37:48] What happens to the son?
[2:37:51] What happens to you? He becomes in
[2:37:54] perfect fellowship
[2:37:57] with the father again.
[2:38:03] standing on the other side of the car.
[2:38:07] No remembrance of sin
[2:38:12] against you.
[2:38:15] No more. Everybody say no more.
[2:38:18] No more sin. There is no more stain
[2:38:23] of the bleach. Can see anywhere.
[2:38:28] You are free.
[2:38:30] I said you are free.
[2:38:32] Come on, say it. Amen. Believe it. Amen.
[2:38:37] You are free.
[2:38:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just as that
[2:38:40] Clorox or that ink can can never be ink
[2:38:44] no more
[2:38:48] because it is broken up and sent back
[2:38:49] again.
[2:38:54] And when confessed sin is confessed and
[2:38:56] been dipped into the blood
[2:39:01] of Jesus Christ. It kills all symptoms
[2:39:07] and every mole of sin goes back to the
[2:39:09] devil
[2:39:13] and he laid on him till the day of
[2:39:14] judgment.
[2:39:17] That's where his eternal destination
[2:39:18] will be thrown into the lake of fire
[2:39:22] and they cast him bridge
[2:39:25] and never to come in remembrance no
[2:39:27] more.
[2:39:29] and man stands justified
[2:39:33] as a son of God.
[2:39:36] Simplicity.
[2:39:39] [Music]
[2:39:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now in
[2:39:44] conclusion, listen to this. Moses under
[2:39:47] the blood of boo
[2:39:50] with his confession
[2:39:52] in the word of God and God could take
[2:39:55] that simple man
[2:39:58] and put his words
[2:40:01] in his mouth and he proved that he was
[2:40:03] Jehovah's servant.
[2:40:07] God proved
[2:40:09] that Moses was Jehovah's servant
[2:40:13] for he could walk out there and Jehovah
[2:40:15] spoke to him by vision.
[2:40:18] He walked out, stretched his hands
[2:40:21] toward the east.
[2:40:23] And I remember God had spoken to him. It
[2:40:27] is God's thought.
[2:40:29] God uses man.
[2:40:32] [Music]
[2:40:35] God spoke to him.
[2:40:37] It's right. He said, "Go stretch that
[2:40:40] rod
[2:40:42] in your hand
[2:40:44] towards the east
[2:40:47] and say
[2:40:49] flies
[2:40:52] flies.
[2:40:54] Locust, I think it was locust."
[2:40:58] Moses under the blood of that goat,
[2:41:04] he walked out there.
[2:41:08] took that stick, reached towards the
[2:41:10] east.
[2:41:12] Thus sayith the Lord, let there be fly.
[2:41:17] Never had a fly.
[2:41:20] He walked on back. It is already spoke.
[2:41:24] He did not wait for it.
[2:41:27] He spoke. He walked back. It is a
[2:41:31] thought now. It is spoke. It is
[2:41:34] expressed.
[2:41:35] It is the word of God.
[2:41:40] It come into a human lips.
[2:41:43] A simple man under the blood of a boy
[2:41:47] or a god.
[2:41:50] Now he says a fly begin to fly around
[2:41:55] in this pond. That pond the word of God
[2:41:57] was spoken through Moses the creator.
[2:42:00] Moses the creator. Moses the creator.
[2:42:04] the creator. Have you understood it?
[2:42:11] Do you want a situation to be created
[2:42:12] around you?
[2:42:16] You are the creator.
[2:42:18] You the word of God through you as a son
[2:42:22] of God. The creator because under the
[2:42:26] blood you standing in the presence of
[2:42:28] God
[2:42:30] and his words wasn't his word.
[2:42:33] your word, not your words.
[2:42:36] If you abide in me and my words abide in
[2:42:38] you,
[2:42:40] then ask what? Whatsoever you desire,
[2:42:44] it shall be given to you. Amen. Where is
[2:42:47] the church standing up?
[2:42:50] Let there be frogs. And there wasn't a
[2:42:53] frog in the country,
[2:42:55] but in one hour's time, there were 10
[2:42:59] deep foot deep in places.
[2:43:03] What was it? It was God the creator
[2:43:07] hiding himself in a simple man.
[2:43:11] Now I want to ask you something.
[2:43:14] Now I want to ask you something.
[2:43:17] If the blood of a bull and a goat
[2:43:21] be used for a bleach
[2:43:24] which can only cover
[2:43:27] would put a man in a position to speak
[2:43:29] the creative word of God.
[2:43:33] and bring flies into existence.
[2:43:37] Why would you stumble
[2:43:39] at the bleach of Jesus Christ?
[2:43:42] His blood which could speak a squirrel
[2:43:47] or something into existence.
[2:43:49] What I'm talking about has happened in
[2:43:51] our day. Brother Bham under the bleach
[2:43:55] of the blood of Jesus
[2:43:57] he spoke squirrels
[2:43:59] into existence. Squirrels be here one
[2:44:03] here.
[2:44:06] If you've never heard about it, hear it
[2:44:08] tonight. Go and research about it.
[2:44:10] William
[2:44:13] man who God used.
[2:44:16] He died in 1965.
[2:44:19] He created Skittles
[2:44:23] as Moses created flogs and other things.
[2:44:28] But where does the potential come from?
[2:44:31] It is in in that bridge. The other
[2:44:33] bridge.
[2:44:35] That bridge.
[2:44:38] You're no longer under the seat.
[2:44:41] You are on the other side of the c
[2:44:45] when you are restored in power, in
[2:44:48] authority, in ability.
[2:44:50] Where are your words?
[2:44:53] They are God's words. Amen. And your
[2:44:55] thoughts are the thoughts of God.
[2:44:59] create something and it comes into
[2:45:01] existence.
[2:45:03] Many times at home without money
[2:45:08] and have no food.
[2:45:10] When the month is starting,
[2:45:13] I give my wife a monthly budget. I look
[2:45:16] for the money and I give it to her.
[2:45:18] Sometimes
[2:45:21] people the money gets finished. I tell
[2:45:24] her don't return.
[2:45:26] Make sure the money is enough. Now if it
[2:45:29] is not she has to die with it many times
[2:45:32] comes the other day came
[2:45:38] what is happening he said do you know
[2:45:40] what God has created money
[2:45:44] you mean it said yes I didn't have money
[2:45:50] I didn't know what to tell you I said
[2:45:53] God
[2:45:56] create
[2:45:59] And he she forgot
[2:46:02] but she had already spoken the word
[2:46:05] when she went back to check
[2:46:08] there was money not once not twice
[2:46:13] you may see and think we are rich
[2:46:18] by what I'm saying hallelujah
[2:46:23] the creative power
[2:46:26] is already
[2:46:27] bride.
[2:46:29] It is there
[2:46:33] that authority.
[2:46:35] It has been given us
[2:46:37] because we were arrested
[2:46:43] the authority.
[2:46:47] Now if you're going through a situation
[2:46:49] if you still love it, it is up to you.
[2:46:54] The authority is not without
[2:46:56] The authorities with you
[2:47:00] tired of bad situation
[2:47:17] have the revelation when you speak a
[2:47:20] word
[2:47:23] come out of the mouth of God,
[2:47:26] the way you've spoken, it will come to
[2:47:28] pass.
[2:47:32] They under you. You know, even
[2:47:36] even soothsayers, they proclaim
[2:47:42] because they know
[2:47:44] that there is power in the world. The
[2:47:47] devil knows it. There's a power in the
[2:47:50] world
[2:47:52] doing all those things and they make
[2:47:53] sacrifices
[2:47:55] the sacrifice must be made
[2:47:59] sacrif
[2:48:08] then they begin prophesying
[2:48:11] from today hence forth so and so you
[2:48:14] will suffer
[2:48:17] then all your doors has closed. May you
[2:48:20] suffer you not get peace.
[2:48:24] I've spoken it so and so you will
[2:48:28] suffer. And then you see somebody
[2:48:30] suffering
[2:48:32] because
[2:48:36] gave a sacrifice and spoke a word.
[2:48:40] Where does the devil get them from?
[2:48:46] That is what I'm preaching. But you
[2:48:47] don't want to believe it.
[2:48:51] And no,
[2:48:53] [Music]
[2:48:55] that is the third pool you hear about.
[2:49:00] The third pool is the word.
[2:49:05] The word must bear fruits of the word.
[2:49:12] That is a higher level of the ordinary
[2:49:14] miracles.
[2:49:16] That is not the show.
[2:49:18] But the world
[2:49:20] is going to see children
[2:49:23] have been restored
[2:49:30] if they know who they are. Hallelujah.
[2:49:37] Now after the sacrifice for
[2:49:40] the sacrifice is not of not of
[2:49:45] sheep.
[2:49:46] The sacrifice
[2:49:48] is above all sacrifices.
[2:49:51] The sacrifice of Jesus Christ
[2:49:55] and the sacrifice
[2:49:58] prophesy again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:50:02] Amen. Hallelujah. Yes sir. That is why
[2:50:05] the Bible says
[2:50:07] the book is open but
[2:50:11] it is still closed amongst men. But he
[2:50:14] says
[2:50:16] But in the grace of the valley
[2:50:22] when he begins to speak
[2:50:25] the mystery of God shall be finished. It
[2:50:28] didn't stop there.
[2:50:31] The seventh angel has already come. We
[2:50:35] have believed him. We accepted a
[2:50:38] message. It is what we eat. It is what
[2:50:41] we believe.
[2:50:43] But after eating and feeding,
[2:50:47] he says, "It is time to prophesy."
[2:50:52] Give me the verse.
[2:50:54] When I speak the scriptures, give them
[2:50:56] to us.
[2:50:58] It is the 11th chapter
[2:51:02] from verse 8.
[2:51:04] And thou shall prophesy again
[2:51:10] among many people and nations time.
[2:51:14] Hallelujah. And the voice which I heard
[2:51:16] from heaven to me again spake again unto
[2:51:19] me. Speak again unto me. And he said,
[2:51:24] take the reader book. Take the reader
[2:51:26] book.

[2:51:30] the power. Take your true identity.

[2:51:38] Receive your abstract tit
[2:51:42] all the way to the beginning.
[2:51:46] Hallelujah. Take the little book. This
[2:51:48] book is open now.
[2:51:52] Amen. Amen. in the hand of the angel.
[2:51:56] And what are you going to do? Give me
[2:51:58] the next verse. And I went unto the
[2:52:00] angel. Somebody should come to the angel
[2:52:03] this morning. And I went unto the angel.
[2:52:06] And I said unto him, you know what?
[2:52:10] We need to have people
[2:52:14] that really desire what I'm talking
[2:52:15] about.
[2:52:17] You won't be there and everything. They
[2:52:20] just beg you.
[2:52:23] I'm talking about
[2:52:26] it's not about those people there.
[2:52:29] It is for those who know who they are.
[2:52:32] Come to church. Come to church.
[2:52:37] You don't need to just be beaten.
[2:52:43] Revelation
[2:52:45] of God. They don't. They don't beg me.
[2:52:52] I know what I am. These are yours.
[2:52:55] This is this food belongs to those.
[2:53:00] When you go to the angel,
[2:53:03] it's not the angel going to say, "Please
[2:53:05] come.
[2:53:10] Are you getting it?"
[2:53:12] But you
[2:53:14] by revelation.
[2:53:17] Hallelujah. Angel, give me the book.
[2:53:21] Give me the book. Which angel?
[2:53:30] I wish I had another one hour.
[2:53:33] Friends, we have received an open book
[2:53:39] by the end of the seventh angel.
[2:53:43] The seventh angel
[2:53:45] is the prophet of our generation
[2:53:49] and he has preached the message. It's
[2:53:51] not his message.
[2:53:53] It is a title deed which he received
[2:53:57] open
[2:54:00] by the lamp
[2:54:02] revealed it.
[2:54:04] What is it? It's the book of redemption.
[2:54:08] What is it? Is the abstract title deal.
[2:54:13] It shows your true origin
[2:54:16] authority you have.
[2:54:18] Everything that Adam lost.
[2:54:24] Everything is restored to you. When you
[2:54:26] eat this message, when you eat the
[2:54:29] message, you read the message. Eating is
[2:54:32] reading and listening.
[2:54:35] Stop listening to those joking things in
[2:54:37] your homes.
[2:54:40] throw them out. Some of you are buying
[2:54:44] DSTV.
[2:54:47] It's a waste of time.
[2:54:49] The bride is somewhere.
[2:54:52] She's being she's eating from something
[2:54:54] nobody knows about.
[2:54:56] Get into the message, brother. Every
[2:54:59] day, every week, listen to something.
[2:55:03] Every eat something in your home as an
[2:55:07] individual. If you don't have those
[2:55:08] books or those sermons, ask we shall
[2:55:11] give you read the Bible, read the
[2:55:13] message.
[2:55:15] This is the open book.
[2:55:18] And when you eat it, when you eat it,
[2:55:20] when you eat it,
[2:55:24] then you come to a moment,
[2:55:27] you become crazy
[2:55:29] and give me the book.
[2:55:34] And he said it, "Take it.
[2:55:38] Take it. Eat it up." And that's what he
[2:55:42] has done. He taped it.
[2:55:45] Take it. Here is the message. Eat it up.
[2:55:51] And it shall make thy belly bitter,
[2:55:55] but it shall be th in thy mouth sweet
[2:55:57] as.
[2:55:59] It will rearrange everything in you.
[2:56:04] correct everything, clean everything up.
[2:56:06] And now go to verse 10. And I took the
[2:56:09] little book out of the angel's hand and
[2:56:12] I ate it up and it was my mouth. My
[2:56:14] mouth sweet as honey. Isn't this message
[2:56:17] sweet?
[2:56:19] And as soon as I had eaten it, amen, my
[2:56:22] belly was bitter. Come on, brother. And
[2:56:25] he said unto me, thou
[2:56:29] must prophesy.
[2:56:32] Oh,
[2:56:33] amen. You are not like the other
[2:56:38] prophecies.
[2:56:40] They are susayers.
[2:56:42] Even those
[2:56:46] that they prophesying, they not
[2:56:48] prophesying anything because they don't
[2:56:49] have a message. They don't have the open
[2:56:52] book.
[2:56:55] The seven seals to them. They are still
[2:56:59] covered and closed.
[2:57:05] Some things I've spoken tonight,
[2:57:08] others have not gotten.
[2:57:10] Come back, come back, come back, come
[2:57:11] back.
[2:57:13] Get the messages and read. When you
[2:57:15] understand,
[2:57:17] you will get mad the way I am.
[2:57:20] Amen.
[2:57:22] Then now you're going to prophesy.
[2:57:25] That is where you will see men and women
[2:57:28] who know the authority they have when
[2:57:30] they prophesying prophesying.
[2:57:34] They no longer lead
[2:57:37] the man of God anointed man. You know
[2:57:40] the things they do
[2:57:45] for that one.
[2:57:49] I was very bad but the man of God I was
[2:57:52] bad. a man of God. I was battling a man
[2:57:55] of God. Now fine that is fine. But today
[2:58:00] this message it takes you from there and
[2:58:02] takes you somewhere now. Now it is no
[2:58:07] longer in the man of God.
[2:58:09] It is in the men and women. Hallelujah.
[2:58:13] The authority
[2:58:16] has been given to everyone
[2:58:19] that has been redeemed and restored.
[2:58:23] They can prophesy
[2:58:25] today.
[2:58:27] I am
[2:58:31] today.
[2:58:40] Let me tell you when you get the
[2:58:42] revelation,
[2:58:44] you will speak in prophecy.
[2:58:49] The prophecy spoken and anointing,
[2:58:52] it can never fail.
[2:58:54] You won't just prophesy to that person.
[2:58:58] You will prophesy unto everybody.
[2:59:01] That is where we are.
[2:59:04] When you know where you came from and
[2:59:06] where you going, that is the level
[2:59:08] you're supposed to be at.
[2:59:11] Let us stand on our feet. Hallelujah.
[2:59:13] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord a
[2:59:15] clap of praise.
