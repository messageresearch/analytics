[Music] amen i mean uh those of you who missed on the samsung sunday service yesterday we also did not have streaming unfortunately a day that it was [Music] like before we go into the world to let you know that the lord willing we are moving [Music] we have already maybe i'll just tell you this we were praying of course to go to our own land and that's still our target we are believing for that and we are continuing with our contributions [Music] [Music] um actually most of the pieces of of land in good areas are 180 160 170 190. but we shall reach the board [Music] loves us so the lord knew we needed a better place in the twitter singapore it's very expensive to get a better place the owner of there is another church in that hall that they have can you say uh but you should know that most of the hotels actually do not rent out their holes to churches water is a singaporean [Music] so their hall has been used it's been uh they were they had rented it out to a church oh yeah wait you're what we can see are you japan i think they've been there for about five years so well i have to do that so that he he may think we are not really so much in need so that he doesn't increase the money now you're getting away for about two months and i was talking with a brother that whole should really be at least 2 million above some people don't understand why because in this place we sit squeezed and the maximum of 100 can get here right a maximum of 100 can get it and the whole sits more than 300. and we rent four hundred thousand a year one or two pounds but we will be renting five hundred thousand dollars that is a miracle that's a miracle it's is okay so i need to see the document you sent me here so we we collected on on sunday sunday but we did not finish the whole psalm are you i might not be able to get uh the document right peak i do not plan to how about going on uh do you have an estimate brother do you have an estimate on the remaining amount of the people what the people collected on sunday the amount that you and brother andrew are supposed to pay well you better tell me so that i can save you here brother andrew you remember the amount no 230 okay that is if we are collecting 400 000 so we need about 400 thousand now katie traitor guy named that's an estimate so if you've not pledged anything robert alina we need four hundred thousand straight again remainder we will be having our first service there on third august okay so the first would be our last service those who do not [Music] [Music] praise the lord come here so probably we will do the we'll pick the pledges brother the deacons will pass some papers to those who do not pledge on sunday after the service so that they can do the pledge for the 400. so a faith now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report is we give this service to you this morning may you just come and take over forget speak to us look on our faith and may we be energized spiritually today whatever trouble we have come with your neighbors with it today praise the lord come here is the lord good is the lord good bananji i'm praying that you will begin it today [Music] so this morning i i'm going to deal with uh a subject i think of course we speak about it every day but every service but today i'm going to go on it head-on my subject is the sixth sense now the scripture here in hebrews begins by saying now faith is the substance of things hoped for one word [Music] now by faith verse 5 enoch was translated that you should not see this and it was not found because god had translated now i met i had some preachers who were saying that enoch was not ruptured because how could he have been raptured before the death of jesus christ sounds nice but actually and the enoch was a type of the seventh church age bride enoch it is a period of time that god or christ will take in order to gather himself for himself a bride so you know chivang it the resurrection of jesus christ and his ascension to heaven up to the time who has come and said these are not just churches which were uh just in historical churches characteristics that we are pointing to the future generation is the song that needed to make your mind so and that these would be appearing or times and times that god would deal with a gentile by sending a message was the one that god used to now call out a bride from the bible now says in the book of the colonials bible remember that at the last trump of god which is under the same dead in christ shall rise and we who are alive [Applause] all the mysteries of god in this fiber will be [Applause] but without faith it is impossible to please him let us read verse 6 together but without i want to hear you reading with me one two three go but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe when you come to god for charity you hear this message and that is a reward of them that diligently sick without faith it is impossible to please god someone has sent me why did he not praise god because he walked with when he was going into the cycles about how the five senses of on the outer reveal five senses to the body there's only one way you can get into the body that's by those five senses there's no other way to contract the body test field here and he also has five senses the only stock they can just like the corn of the field and weed in the field they can be anointed with the same holy spirit that the real believer is anointed with [Music] foreign now i want to show you brother you can stop that chair let me let me share something for you here praise the name of the lord brother can you project it for me all right so now i want to show you this stream being here you know everybody says it clean your mind all right so here we have man one on two this is who you are who i am [Music] you know these are the [Music] that way more now the spirit also has five senses that's memory imagination and reasoning now [Music] your spirit can be able to uh to have affection you know to contact things in this world one of us brought him on to things that touch us things that we have memory truly now you see but then this is the spirit man but inside of the spirit man is so i'm not talking about something foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] prophet was talking about here obviously not many christians they get filled with a spirit on their body like they get anointed with a spirit on their body that phenomenal [Music] [Music] the holy spirit [Music] no that they can easily connect with the spirit of god you know if you want to know you know actually in the book of uh i think esther it is it talks about the uh receiving a new heart a new [Music] accepting to follow jesus and you also receive a new spirit without having the holy ghost now follow me closely here now the new spirit will help you if you it's not god's spirit symbol you are catholic it's your spirit all of us are born with a bad spirit but not without even no more your movie our spirit oh my god faith god spirit that movie we are born with a bad conscience everything you can get out of your face we are born with our very vulgar imagination we are born with wrong and demonic and satanic reasoning whatever god gives you his word you know in all right now all of us are born that's a network's already where to kill okay our memory we only memorize bad things we are born so much touched by the word of god you begin to yield your members spiritual members your conscious your mind and together in the world of memory you you you can see things people can't see oh superman you'll be so thrilled hallelujah amen you are not ashamed of christ from that spirit [Applause] and his spirit does not only come on your body on your spirit but he wants it to come in your soul hoping for jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] it is by faith that we overcome the world and seek to the one willing by faith that we will go in the rapture it is by faith we praise god oh [Music] you can only contact god by the sick sis not by the imagination necessary and you want things to be a certain way you may not see a that's why they call believers fools they will ask you but if you really think of all the words and reason well he stopped to be a prophet you are coming up here and never said mr man messiah [Music] my faith has brought me to the right let me tell you your faith may take you in the middle of nowhere amen oh hallelujah amen speak and go forward i i [Music] he's saying we should speak and go in the water he will give us those muscles are you in the will of [Music] situated i may not see it foreign [Music] [Music] um [Music] oh i did moving give me all what i need [Music] praise the lord praise the lord come here dr milan i have a question for you a man is going to die does he hear aveda when does a man stop hearing that in the process do you know what foreign here is what i believe i'm not a medical master but he may not talk and time comes when even sight fails and i take that from many testimonies he said i'll give my life to christ [Music] is now remember brother who was dying man of all that we have been there when they're sick that came in the church mechanism even ran around not too congratulations [Music] and i tell you what i think a few um if several of them now more than 10 are baptized counts by hearing not by spelling touching feelings as long as you can hear people let me tell you what the devil will do whatever will always fight you from hearing [Music] and from the messenger the anointed ones are the end times he says what is faith faith is something that faith is something that is revealed to you all
