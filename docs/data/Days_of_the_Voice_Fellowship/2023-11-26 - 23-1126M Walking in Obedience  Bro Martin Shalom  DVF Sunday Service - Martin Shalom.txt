Lord Jesus Christ the Fire come and move in our God may you bless our hearts that Lord will be able to move with the cloud this morning in the name of Jesus CH amen yeah turn with me to First Samuel 1 samel chapter 15 if you're there you say Amen I'll begin from uh vers 22 amen can read [Music] [Music] then you also read 23 [Music] [Music] amen may have your seats on and off uh maybe but don't know uh so this morning uh I'm going to talk about walking in obedience amen blessed be the name of the Lord and where we have read we are seeing uh the prophet of God saying something to the king you know uh God wants us to obey his [Music] word blessed be the name of the Lord and he expect us to walk in obedience and there are some things that we are going to see alongside the way [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord because even Jesus said that if you love me you will keep my commandment so if you read with me uh 1 Samuel chapter 15 We Begin from verses two it says that thus says the Lord of host I remember that which americ did to Israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from [Music] Egypt and now go and Smit Amit and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but SL both man and woman infant and cing ox and sheep camel and ass amen destroy everything here God was giving instruction blessed be the name of the Lord and they were entitled to obey what God was telling [Music] them God had a reason why he was saying so blessed be the name of the Lord and when God gives us directive it is not a parable it is always Direct it God gives it with Revelation blessed be the name of the Lord amen God's law is direct it is not a parable when he says that the wge of sin is death he means that that if we sin we shall surely die praise the the Lord when God spoke in uh in Genesis Genesis 3 and when God gave instruction to Adam and Eve that was Final and as long as they obeyed what God told them to do they were okay and brother in the message talken he says that full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token full obedience to the word of God us to the Token to the Holy Ghost amen if you obey God fully we will have the Holy Spirit he will give us the Holy Ghost that's says the messenger and why are we not seeing the outpouring of the Holy Ghost in our mid why are we not seeing it in Christian [Music] fraternity amen it is there but if you read this quote it shows that if we obey God fully all of us we are entitle to the Token blessed be the name of the Lord if we walk in full obedience to the word of God the victory is on our side blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise the lord we shall go slow and when God requires anything it must be accomplished there is no way of dodging that there is no shortcut for that when God requires us to repent for us to gain another level for us to get somewhere we must repent there is no any other shortcut blessed be the name of the Lord amen and here when he gave his instruction and we are seeing King so went the battle in this very chapter God's instruction was very very clear it was direct it was straight it was in the light blessed be the name of the Lord it was not even in symbols praise be to God Amen when God gives us his word it is not a GU work is not gambling God's word is always direct and he want us to obey his word blessed be the name of the Lord and here where we have read where brother started from you see that Samuel he said that Lord as uh as as the Lord as great Delight in burnt offering and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord that is a question that we may offer our sacrifice we may worship we may shout we may pray in Tong Tong of men and angels but the question still comes back are we obedient to the word of God not obeying some God word supposed to be obeyed fully amen God does not expect us to obey his word infraction [Music] butey the whole blessed be the name of the Lord and when we obey the word of God fully that's when we have Victory and we are going to see here that somewhere when when sa went the battle so fought the Battle he did according to what God had told him amen but somewhere he reached somewhere and he compromised but remember so was not God's choice to begin with you agree with me blessed be the name of the Lord because you remember in Samuel when Israel demanded for the king they wanted to be like other nations who are the king who was leading them and that displeased God blessed be the name of the Lord but God gave them their desire blessed be the name of the Lord and they show sa to lead them because he was great in Tre maybe was giant maybe had six PS it was maybe well trained and for them according to their see their perspective they saw that that man would make a great king but remember God was God was the king of Israel he was the champion of the champion he was the great warrior amen when God LED them in their battles they never lost any battle somewhere in the world the Bible says gave them Victory which they did not even fight for he gave them cities which they never build amen he gave them V which they never [Applause] planted that was their King blessed be the name of oh how important it is to be led by God this reach somewhere they they compromised they admired other kings when they looked at them the way the Kings used to dress huge element putting on arm breasts having huge Spears and we also need to have one and God was not pleased Samuel was not pleased because he spoke for God amen that troubled him so much and asked them for all the time they have been together what he has not done blessed be the name of the Lord but God told samel give them the king praise be to God and they shall Sal be there king that's why when God chooses you that is something different from when men [Music] chooses many time when someone is just chosen Maybe by uh by the church or by organization by group there is a time when he will feel like [Music] amen but when God chooses you no matter what happens you are so sure you are chosen by God Amen when God elects you and reveals his word to you convinced and concerned that you are in the bright no matter what comes your way amen even when you are weak you will expose yourself to stand because you know God called you even when it is raining with snows and thunderstorm and and lightening and you will still come to church inside you there is Supernatural things there is something pushing you to go but when you are just go to come understand there is nothing inside you that pushes you blessed be the name of the Lord I'm talking about walking in obedience God want us to walk in obedience this he want us to Bear the voice of the Prophet amen he want us to live according to his word he wanted to see things the way he sees them that's why the Bible says walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise the Lord walking in obedience this man thought he was walking in obedience and you're going to see when he came back after the battle was over and he was giving a testimony how God gave him Victory how he did according to God's word blessed be the name of the Lord but God's word this approved him blessed be the name of the Lord and here says uh okay we begin from chapter one Samuel also said unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be a king over his people over Israel now therefore Howen thou unto the voice of the word of the Lord not the of Samuel but the voice of the Lord thus says the Lord of H I remember that which am did to Israel how he laid a wait for him in the way when he came up from Egypt am Who are the amenites this are the nation which attack Israel after they had escaped from Egypt blessed be the name of the Lord so the am I'm looking for something here H where the grandsons of Esau you know the es and Jacob so this these are the descendants of Jacob of [Music] es and after the Israel they had uh escaped after they had come out of Egypt amen these people attacked them on their way after that battle they were there like as if they were very weak amen amen then this tribe attacked [Music] them blessed be the name of the Lord and here when Saul was an was anointed and the word of God came to the prophet speaking to him and God remembered he said thus say is the Lord of host I remember that which am did to Israel brother sister do not forget what the devil what the enemy has done to you you should always [Applause] remember amen don't forget what the devil has done to you forget what the devil has done in your life don't forget what the devil has done in your family amen because when you forget you will sit back and relax amen amen but every time you remember you won't give him an opportunity yes sir because you know the Bible says the devil is moving like a ring lion was somebody that made and remember in job the bible say that God asked the devil where are you from he say I was moving to and and God asked him my servant that is the work of the enemy he always moving here and there look for an opportunity so if you forget well with you blessed the name of the Lord so always remember what the enemy did to you maybe you were sick maybe you were bedden and the Lord healed you do not take that for granted maybe you were a sinner we were a sinner there but the grace of God us let us not forget that amen we were in Mar we were in sin but God came from Glory pulled us out of the world and by the grace of God he is feeding us every day do not forget that because even you are God remembered what the am did and let us see what happened to them blessed be the name of the Lord and he says that he laid a wait for he laid a wait for him in the way and when he came up from Egypt now go and smite the am amen amen and utterly destroy all that they have walking in what obedience here God is Not mentioning sparing anything and as the word goes on you just look into your life the in your life are we walking in full obedience blessed be the name of the Lord and if you still have some in your [Applause] life that say the word destroy them amen spare them not but both man and women infant and slings o and [Music] sheep you ask yourself what had the cows done what did the camels do when you go to Tess region and come back with a chicken they call it chicken from Tess region amen amen when you go to toru and bring a hand they say that hand is from Toro that is why the Lord said destroy because those even the cows were Amit blessed the name of the Lord young and old and sa gathered the people together and numbered them inal 200,000 foot men 10,000 men of Judah and so came to a city of and laid await in the valley and sa said the can go apart get you down from among the am you see the man is still following the instruction when he made the Amit he told them to go apart amen praise the Lord oh sorry it's the he told the the Canaanites to get out to get get you down from among the amales who are this can these are the people uh I you can TR for it here amen amen uh these are the people who came out of Jethro the grand uh uh the Moses blessed be the name of the Lord so God is speaking soul is speaking to is telling them to go because God sent him to destroy the Canaanites the amen so the man is even he was even showing Mercy told other ones you depart from this place blessed be the name of the Lord go apart and get it down among the l i destroy you with them for he showed kindness to all the of Israel when they came out of Egypt they showed kindness of Israel when they came out of Egypt so the can departed from among the Amal [Music] and so theit from from hav until Thou come to that is over against Egypt and he took the G listen carefully and he took the god the king of am alive that was contradicting TOS three because God say go and smite the and destroy all that they have not them and soul is sparing the king amen amen not only that and and all the people with age of the SW but soul and the people spared a and the best of the sheep and of the oen and of the fatlings and of the Lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and refused that they destroyed utterly amen church is that amen so the man that is what they wanted God wanted to be their King God knew from the beginning when you get a king after your own choice he will drift away from God's word and at first it's not all about how much you keep the word that you are keeping some of them when we are walking in obedience God demand us to keep all the word blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why the prophet says full obedience all word of God will entitle you to the Token not some word so obeyed bless the name of the Lord talk about separation brother sister the word will come every day it will bound you separate from this separate from that separate from this but there are things we share so dearly in our every time you think about it you beat around the [Music] bush that's what Saul was doing that is what he did amen maybe looked at the king you know the prophet says sin is pleasing sin is Pleasant amen and he says how the how the snake traps the bir it says when the bir's eye get in contact the snake's [Music] eye that is gone that is g there is how he explain how the snake plays around and it becomes like a spell so when the watches it will be there saying by the time it remembers it will be C so is always is Pleasant the devil shows you this why shows Jesus the Bible says he took him The Pinacle and showed him the whole world the riches the women the pleasures the kingdom amen talk of Rome where 90% is made of God because Jesus by the time Jesus was born remember it was even the the Roman Empire amen so when the king looked at this king oh praise to God may he can even be a king after me do you think that King was an ugly one that he was there when he was when he could smile it could be as if he was crying that you could not even understand that King might have looked good and he was powerful amen until Saul was converted and say we are not going to kill we may understanding but God told him the instruction was destroy everything and and the instruction is clear today separate from every unbelieving thing amen God want us to separate from unbel and oby the word fully and walk in full obedience praise be to God this man SP animals he looked the beautiful and he say oh this should be sacrific that was man's judgment God's judgment was so different God says destroyed everything y not yourself with unbelievers because you are not equal amen the instruction is still clear today [Music] God want the church to walk in full obedience to the word amen when he say the sister put on long long dresses dressing modest up don't Bain on that don't compromise with it amen don't say about this one do you know that creature called mid when you put on M you just know how those people look like the hips all become outside blessed be the name of the Lord so this man when he reached there but and the people spared do you know what means in Hebrew means violence blessed with the name of the god in you end from the beginning is amen God knows past and future present past and future Amen brother we don't know what the future is and even we can hardly remember our past bless Lord how he was looking good said this one will work for us at least he will lead the the King's Men or maybe he will lead the farmers he didn't know the prophet says means character amen and this man's name was [Music] [Applause] amen generation it is you call your child wherever they are their friends will cry when they go in the neighborhood they will when they with the young ones they sh even before they spend an hour there they crying what your child has done has beaten the neighbor's child almost breaking their nose because your child is now the man brought the man who is calledo violence then came the word of God the word of the Lord say it repented me that I have set up sa to be the king amen God is repenting for he is turned back from following me and have not performed my Commandments Jesus said if we love him John 14: 15 we will keep his Commandments God is [Applause] regretting he repented me that I have set up the soul to be to be king for you stand back from following Meed my Commandments It gri soul it gried Samuel cry to the Lord all night when you gried home do you cry to some sisters when they grieved they go to their mother's grave father's graen that maybe you know I'm going through mother why did you leave me here but if that mother on that grave will come out you will see that girl will return to where he came she came from but the man of God he cried before the Lord the whole there something to learn from this amen don't go and hide in your bed chamber when you are trouble and you start remembering the one you have lost and you start repeating your trouble what happened to me I have demons cry to God Amen if minister to God the day to God say there is no prayer that pray before God that will not be answered amen he may not answer immediately but still he will answer that prayer blessed be the name of the Lord so this man went before the Lord and he cried the whole night blessed be the name of the Lord and when Samuel Rose and when Sam Rose early to meet Saul in the morning it was told of Samuel saying so came to camel and behold he set him up a place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to Gil and Samuel came to sa and say and sa said unto him don't remember ver vers four the Commandment the direction which God gave you he was supposed to destroy everything but now here when Samuel met Saul and Saul said uh they have brought them from am oh sorry well okay 13 and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be the Lord I have per the Commandment of the Lord you see hypocrisy what and the man of God asked where are you from my brother huah Hallelujah I was in the I was just there pray oh Hallelujah blessed the name of the Lord told my heart went with you when you were going to God first gives you a chance amen God first gives us a chance to repent an is this everything that you have sold oh yes glory to God hallu never even disturbed us it was just [Music] that was opport to repent he I believe had say oh God be merciful to me sin not that we temped we have sped some the Bible say if a wicked man repent God forgives the same was given to when after sister suff maybe going to talk about late coming man has come in the house now we have bought new things we have put a fridge there put there we have bought something else it is understandable for the sister to maybe maybe that was the reason why she delayed sa sa is this they were not streaming their services if they were streaming their services came streaming maybe she wouldn't even have come to [Music] church chur the government did not sue them for killing a person but even if you're the head of would you attack such people a man has lied and they fall dead and they said that fear of God fell upon and people feared to join them the say God added unto them daily amen am it was not pulling put on naked and you will make those Brothers come put on and you willp ameny the word fully blessed be the name of the Lord then the man of God ask what am I hearing bleeding in my ears the lowing of the oxygen which I hear also crying the America way because Soul had brought them amen amen and Saul said what me then this that's Samuel and Saul said they have brought them from the Amit for the people spared the Beast of the sheep he was saying people sped who has given the Commandment when a commandment is given out there should be somebody to speak it out and then there must be followers amen amen now you can't say anything now the man was that people told that these sheep will work they will work for us maybe they were even special Fran hybrid hybrid bless the name of the Lord and they really they were good and he brought for the people Spar them the best of the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord it even shows me that Samuel's God was different for you would have said our God but he was right because Samuel's God told him to destroy all but the other Go's God told him he was speaking as if he was and the rest we have utterly destroyed brother sister it's not about what you have destroyed it is all about what you have spared the Commandment was Destroy Everything amen they destroyed and SP some and when he came before God before the prophet of God is saying we have destroyed others but this one we have spared we have destroyed the little children we have destroyed the mothers we have spared the king some oxen some ass amen blessed be the name of the Lord then Saul said uh uh then Saul said uh said unto Saul Samuel said unto Saul stay stay and I will tell thee what the Lord said to me this night and he said unto him in the night conference [Music] remember Samuel when he had this things his soul was troubled he knew that problem had come in Israel and he went before the Lord to intercede to plead the whole night amen something happened when he was interceding the Lord spoke to him and gave him Direction and when he came to me S maybe if he came before asking inquiring from God maybe they would have fought each other he went to seek he went to seek the perfect will of God God what are you saying about this we have strayed he knew they in problem say message then Jesus come and that when Jesus leaves our home Trouble Is On The Way amen that's why Jesus has to be in our hom so the king said St on and someone said when thou was a little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribe of Israel and the Lord anointed thee over Israel and the Lord sent thee on the journey and said go and utterly destroy is again reminding him of the [Music] word amen he was supposed to obey every word destroy the Sinners the and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then did thou not obey the voice of the Lord liely upon the spoil and is evil in the sight of the Lord [Music] said Samuel I have obeyed the voice of the Lord I have gone the way which the Lord sent me and I brought God the king of am androy ladies and gentleman to be a sinner is so bad that even when God is speaking to our hearts we are reasoning God is speaking to but he's blinded it's not all about obeying we must obey fully we must take every word we must live by every word may God give us the grace amen this man was convinced that because but the thing was clear is always clear amen and when we disobey against the word of God God will confront you amen the only place where God will confront a man when you are disobeying the word we are pulling his through by Disobedience amen this man insisted seriously but the people took of the spoil and sheep and oxygen and sheep of the of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice and the Lord thy God in gilar and samel said has the Lord has a great daylight in burnt offering and sacrifice in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to Heen than the fat of RS you go you win milon you come excited you give your offering that is what was doing you have hit a very very good deal and you have come to give and you want even everybody to know that you're giving you reach where the baskets are you remove your wallet you remove the money put here you count [Music] it is not about that amen amen God want us to obey this man was offering sacrifice of what God forbid him to do but to begin because was he was not God's choice it was People's Choice amen that's why he was pleasing the people but the Bible says the word of God comes to the prophet and the prophet is correcting him and man is still insisting blessed be the name of the Lord this not all it's not about our singing how much you can pray how much you can enter in the spirit how much you can shout God want us to obey his word fully blessed be the name of the lord it's not how much we give giving is good singing is good praying is good but what God is has Delight into obeying his word amen not obeying some word obeying the full word of God that's what supposed to do the Bible tells us that day many will come and they will say cast out demons in your name we pray for the SI and will tell them I never knew what why they obeyed they obeyed some part of the where he says you shall Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover but where he say that be holy because I am Holy that one was very where he says I permit not to teach Authority that one they did not yes weer yeah Jesus called me Jesus called me I died and and he told me to go they are moving they go Church to church that they died and went to heaven they went to hell oh they went in a painted heaven where they found the son the Holy Ghost and the father and the son was bus crying look at the world go and tell them and when you confront the very person and tell about sister look at your position in the word I know who I believed obedience is better the Propet says God calls for total separation amen when God met Abraham he gave Abraham his wife told him leave your father's the promised land amen Abraham started the journey with with his father God never visited Abraham AB obeyed some but thanks be to God if you are the elect of God God will create a station amen somewhere down the road they reached a point and their hmen started fighting against one another the Bible says God is blessing make rich and no this men started fighting one another Abraham thought T said no if you're going east choose first I choose and you say for me I've chosen that where you wanted to choose why did you choose first if If Abraham chose first where he went L because you know there is water there there is so he gave him the he gave him the Rope to to kill himself amen amen the man lifted his eyes he had a wife with a vision he was so political in the home my husband why are we getting Sting with this man all the time we have been with him what have we gained look at the city IED you are a very very very very serious woman you even delay to tell let us go that it amen but he didn't see the destruction that was in Sodom but because ABR was El that very day amen God came down and spoke to Abraham and told him now walk before perfect before me after he had obeyed the word fully now blessed be the name of the Lord if we don't obey the word of God shall the wild for many many years but God want us to walk in obedience and I'm going to take some quotes amen we where read vers says that Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stess as an iniquity and Idol [Music] amen the prophet told us in the quote we read at first in the message talken that full obedience to the word isled amen why are we not having the token amen why you seeking the Holy Ghost and you're not receiving him you said brother fasted I prayed i' have now given up if God want me to go to Rapture I will go to Rapture you will not go because the Bible say right from the days of John the until today the kingdom of God suff violence and what is the kingdom of God the Holy Ghost amen how many believe that you mean when Jesus said let thy kingdom come me that okay it did not mean that that the buildings and the kingdom to come down it is the Holy Ghost amen and it says from that time up to today tomorrow until that Kingdom Sabbath VI it's only those who take it by force who will take it the weaklings will not take it every time you think about fasting you say oh as you prepare to fast two days your neighbor is suffering fromers but here he says why I brought that what is the reason here he says for Rebellion is a sin of Witchcraft how many witches we do we have in churches today they are rebellious amen St as iniquity very St after hearing the word like this they go to the video Hall after getting out of the church they go to pool table and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he had also rejected you the from being King amen if we reject the word God reject us if you draw near unto me I will draw near unto thee amen it is to traffic draw nearer he draws nearer get far he also draw far away amen amen and Samuel said unto him the Lord has rign the Kingdom of Israel from the this day and has given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou amen he lost the kingdom because he did not obey God's [Music] word God wants us to obey his voice amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord the Pro in the message handwriting on the worldall he says something here we are not expelled or we are not immune from God's judgment you hear that yeah we are the bride we are the bride we we are predestinated it is through you pred it is through you the bride but remembering tell us it is the grace of God that t our Heart To Fear amen if you are predestinated you have the grace of God in your soul and you will be careful that's why apost Paul says shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid and the prophet of God says you are not immune from God's judgment when we disobey his Commandment that is right thus goes for a nation our individuals or churches or whatever it is when we disobey God we will receive judgment for it yes sir when we disobey God the Propet says that goes for a nation individuals amen when we disobey God individual or churches or whatever it is Disobedience has a recompense when we disobey God we will God will confront us you remember when Moses son was not circumcised according to the promise which God gave to ABRA every man child born in Israel was supposed to be circumcised and this man was busy in the service he forgot about his own service and the Bible says God wanted to kill Moses the word of God Came Upon Andi was spiritual enough to save the husband she R and circumcised got a sharp cut and it before he says your bloody husband and that stop the blessed be the name of the Lord sometime even ministers forget and you too much their brothers they go for missionary work and even spend eight months they beat the enemy in the field the enemy comes back the name of the Lord and if Jesus told the disciple to go this uh to go this and they went and do something over different if they did they disobeyed and God will never honor Disobedience amen who people who are disobedient are people that have not yet been adopted and placed you have you not been separated person then maybe you haven't been adopted but once adopted positionally place in the body of Christ you are of all things you not for us in the grace Jesus died for us amen notice that when that what God did to his son God did not ask us to do anything that he would not do he took his own son who had been obedient no matter how much you scream how loud you scream how much you pray that devil has got a little right to stay there and he will stay there too that is right he has got a right to stay there not only that but if you supposed to have done something and did not do it he has a legal right of Disobedience you see the devil walk so close to us looking for mistakes and when we error when weay he marks that when you go before the lord the devil chooses and if you don't put that right the prop says he has a right to stay there [Music] you pray you shout you R you jum you the guy is there he has a legal right to stay there because there is something that you have done right but you have not made it right blessed be the name of the Lord amen so what we need to walk in full obedience that's why the message came when we in Pentecost when we're in the world salvation was just a fashion of the aight English speakers men putting on neck tie others used to tie this short one amen so if you young and you get that was [Music] identification but when the message came the message showed us Sal is beyond those things salvation is all about obeying God's word amen and that's when that devil will obey when we obey every word the devil will not ask a right to stay blessed be the name of the Lorden there was no virtue in serpent oh on the pole you remember the BR is the Lord in the wilderness when they disobeyed God sent serent and they by serpent the Wilderness in Exodus amen and very many people were dying Moses went before the Lord and prayed and God gave him a remage he told him go get a make a Bren Serpent and hang it up whoo will be beaten by the snake when he will lift his eyes and see the Bren they not die it was simple obey the word and look at the refuse to look now you are making just we we are being beaten by snakes you are making a br serpent that was none of God's business the remed was look there the answer is today away to [Music] Jesus don't say you have many problem I'm so troubled Look Away to Jesus he has got the answer for you look and you shall not die hallelujah amen am and here they supposed to look at the Bren what you have to do okay sorry neither was there any virtue in the poll nether amen it hanged on but to they who looked they lived it was obedience to God's word amen God never told them that the pren serpent will heal you nether the power was in the PO nether was on the Bren but the virtue and the healing was in oby in God's word look and leave my brother live amen just look and leave blessed be the name of the Lord amen I'm about to close it says bring in the message being certain of God be certain of God when Elijah went to the shite woman he told the lady bring a musle of bread in your hand and fetch me a little water she looked at him there was something told her that man that there's something told her that man knew what he was talking about this is where the Revelation comes in that when you heard the word with your colleagues there was something inside your heart the SE of God in you telling you what that man is saying is the truth but if you in the church for one year two years years you are still debating message in a WR [Music] place what is the difference between me and those girls if I just make a small cut brother sister walk in full [Music] obedi amen most of us that is the mistake we make exactly that's what sa did heed there and debated that is what a did he reached there he saw a Babylonian garment maybe it was expensive Fabric and [Music] say this time my wife will put on and people will wonder as she's coming to offer everybody will look and say she forgot that day reward to sin is death brother Bram said that if one member is not working walking right that can destroy the entire church amen amen he said that one person can hinder somebody's healing because you're not working right he said that on the Judgment you will answer for because you hindered God to do his work that God help us to walk in full OB amen says when the prophet spoke to that woman Something Told The Woman this man knows what he's talking about and Jesus said my sheep knows my voice when the prophet was speaking to this woman she only had a little bread remaining but she was hearing the voice of the master amen praise be to God there was a presence around her and she knew that this is unusual she knew this was a miracle am if you keep some little food what do you do do you pray or you begin calling for help things that here we are remaining with small food I believe this woman was praying each time she goes to pick them pray amen she was saying God you Jehovah is getting little look at my little amen and on the last day the answer came in a different the man came to her and asked her you have some food bring me even a drink but because she was praying she was waiting on the Lord and they that wait on the Lord shall Ren their strength her strength was already renewed her was already renewed amen she heard the voice of God she never hesitated they know whether it is scripture or [Music] not my sheep knows my voice it means you know whether the scripture or not that's why God will not speak to you sister that brother martin is your husband yet he's married God bless church God spoke to me my sheep knows my if you know the scripture I don't know how you chase that Spirit you will condemn it you will cast it and if you could see it you will boil it you will burn it because not the voice she turns in obedience that is what they have got to do and when she turn to obey what the prophet said to do then came the Thunder Hallelujah then came the Thunder From Heaven and every man looks around to hear thus says the Lord thus says the Lord the bar will not go empty oh the cruise run dry until the day that the Lord God sent rain oh Blessed Be the name of Praise the Lord she was waiting on God she was praying she had prayed up amen and God answered her and when you come to Total obedience in the Mage Jehovah then you can have possession till you obey totally blessed be the name of the Lord amen when Abraham came to Total obedience and came to the place that he had everything out of the way his only begotten son God spoke to him and told him give me Isaac he never Abraham knew God given taken blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and he never with this boy this Jehovah G and he told his servants to wait for him he told them I'm going with a little I and him after sacrificing we shall come back amen he was not sure whether Isaac will come abrah never told sah amen sah was at home maybe she was singing redeemed blood of redeemed and so happy in Jes sh forever [Music] she's busy singing the man is taking the son for sacrifice without hesitating amen when God spoke to Abraham he looked at the time frame he waited on the and the promise came to pass he was so sure that God was able to raise this son AB obey fully and he went with his son he removed everything out of the way his father died Lord separated himself then God told Abraham rise and walk through the land it is all yours amen Lord will have to first separate will have to first die Amen Let ter die this afternoon let us separate with the Lord this afternoon let us drop things we are cherishing in our Liv and from today's SP God want to walk with us after getting everything out of the way blessed be the name of the Lord then look unto Jesus look promise am oh I love that every time I think of that I get religious feeling just as soon as I
