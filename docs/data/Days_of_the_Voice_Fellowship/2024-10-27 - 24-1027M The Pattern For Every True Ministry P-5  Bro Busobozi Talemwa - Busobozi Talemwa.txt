in our ministry father we bless your name because of your goodness and of your mercies we thank you Jesus we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen while you're still standing we had a wonderful overnight last night last Friday and um I don't know if the sister is here but we had a very Supernatural service on Friday and if you did not if you were here and you didn't get a visitation then then you really need to have a visitation and um and so she says God bless you Pastor I wanted to follow up on the conversation yesterday I didn't share the full details of the Visions I received but I feel L to share the complete picture with you now in my vision she saw a vision here in the overnight I saw a newly built church amen well she saw the vision here I believe God is speaking about this church and but that's not all with a river flowing through it initially the there was that there was that water initially the water was dirty and stained with dir however in the next part of the vision the water transformed into Clean and Clear Water finally I saw the river overflowing how I ready for this I saw the river overflowing with [Applause] dollars if you receive it social it to you we don't we have not only received the word we've not only received the word the word comes with extra I saw it's not my message it's the message from the Lord s she's saw she's also saying what she saw I saw the river overflowing with dollars presenting an abundance of financial blessings and I've said it here many times that I see many are going to be millionaires but those are the ones who are committed to the work of God who are giving the to the work of God especially the land fund and all that and you has been giving God has showed us our church is going to be built we are not only going to buy land but our church is going to be built praise the name of the Lord and then she says she failed to share the vision with me entire in its entirety we say praise the name of the Lord I believe that was from the Lord amen well we are under expectation for great things God is moving in a m and we had a very wonderful overnight were here the whole night some people who thought they would do we had no time for do we were praying the whole night we had a wonderful worship night and up to 5 a.m. in the morning praise the Lord and so if you missed it don't miss the next one the last Sunday of November last Friday every last Friday we have an overnight it is not worth missing come with a friend and even if they are nonbelievers come with God is up to something friend you believe that amen I know you're going to be SE for a long time so I just want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ isn't the Lord wonderful hasn't he been wonderful amen I believe he has been wonderful before we we get seated we are going to read the scripture but before we go there I have a letter in my [Music] hands we had a school yes that is good now we had a school um in um uh Bethany we had been given a place to do our youth meetings there they changed their mind and they say that now you NE is going to be marking them [Music] but today I'm happy to announce to you we have a better and cheaper School amen praise the name of the Lord and we've not come up with an overall um figure because a because of the change of the school there several things that have changed but at least we've got this school this a letter that is given us that school for 4 million shs amen praise the Lord um it says days of the voice ministries of the voice respon to your request I bring you GRE Christian greetings from Institute of Technology and thank you for the great work you are doing to the nation through your ministry I am writing in response to your request dated 19th for using our facilities to support your Youth Camp [Music] your an it's not a one time offer after thorough discussions with the relevant Institute [Music] authorities I am happy to inform you that your request has been granted amen there are several terms here but the main one is for you to know that we've got it for cheaper than we were getting it and of course they also have the uh beding beds accomodation and so the Lord is good amen so we shall briefly meet with the with the committee after the service to reconcile our new budget so please stay behind after the service shall we go to the scripture now second Timothy thank you musicians God bless you second Timothy chapter 4 second Timothy chapter 4 uh vers five I'm reading in the name of the Lord Jesus but watch thou in all things andure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry [Music] be seated uh all our all our visitors you welcome feel at dvf here we have no love but love Creed but Christ no book but the Bible no membership but Fellowship you're here for your first time feel happy feel relaxed there just a few of us not here this morning but I think I know of Sister Rose who is in Tanzania and the others perhaps are streaming with us God bless you all we certainly want to welcome you amen hallelujah Hallelujah I have a a subject this morning that I'd like to share with you I preached on this um before on Sunday is just a continuation of of Sunday service we I was speaking on the pattern for every true Ministry so how many I enjoying that subject amen and um I always want to finish it with it and then I feel God has more last night last night um I I struggled and I couldn't get what to talk about not that I didn't have things to talk about but I always want to hear the voice of God for the service for every particular so I got frustrated and I I said to myself let me go sleep sometimes I don't even sleep up to what whatever time so when I went to bed and you know um I I was still meditating about the service and what the Lord wanted me to speak about and uh um then there it came and I shouted [Music] Hallelujah afterwards I felt so sorry for my wife said what is happening I said as as it come well she's used to me whenever inspiration comes I just shout and eny and so because it is something from the supernatural world and so this morning I can confirm to you that the Lord wants me to continue this subject and um some different directions that you shall take but uh on the same subject because I've been talking on the pattern about the pattern for every true Ministry and but I I I've taken different directions to it one of the days I talked about um the false Ministries the false prophets uh but Anointed with the right Spirit but having the wrong Doctrine so we talked about that and we saw really I think on Sunday did we talk about that on Sunday and then on on on on on Wednesday we also spoke on the same subject but speaking on the true Ministry so today in a way I want us to continue with that sometimes I think they are more here they are more online than than is here sometimes we hear from them from other countries all over the world from Europe from America sometimes Ethiopia I know there is a Saints who do not have a fellowship in the north part of of the country that follow the ministry here and this morning I was informed by a brother from West n uh Brother s success I think his name is he said he was gathering a few of his friends and they will be following the service this morning and so I pray that the Lord will use us to be a blessing to his bride this morning amen so the pattern for every true Ministry now in second Peter chapter 1 verse 10 it says where for the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure sure I'm not sure what exactly you reading you in that is Timo so I want you to go to Peter excuse him sometimes those things happen um how many are glad to be message Believers we are glad to believe the message of and so this morning I want us to once again go through these things and try to establish how we can be able to um find a true Ministry it used to be that we thought only it is the message versus the denominations but it is no more that way even among those who claim to believe the message there's a lot of messes here and there and so we want to be sure we are under a right Ministry We are following the right Ministry because if you are under a wrong Ministry then you are blind and you being led by the Blind and Jesus said if the blind lead the blind they the one who is being led goes to heaven but the other one falls into the ditch right are you following me he says both of them fall into the ditch so you see many times when a a person receives the receive the truth they did not want to leave their denomination and the reason is they always thought that they would change their denomination so you find that a man like we shall see later on called Martin Luther he was a Roman Catholic priest he did not think that the Catholic church can completely go astray he thought the doctrines were wrong but he he had an idea that he can be able to reform that same church and remain as a part of it but you see later on he realize it is not possible to reform a dead body you can only come out of it you know Jesus said come out of the of all my people be not partakers of a sin so that is why it is very important for you to know who is leading you to know even in the message churches which Ministry are you sitting what does your pastor preach what does he believe because you see what I believe is what I impress on you what the speed behind me is what comes on you if you find the pastor is immoral even if he believes the truth and he begins to preach those immoral spirits will come on the people and you find the same spirit is going around the congregation if a pastor is a man with short temper you find the same thing happens to the congregation you find the people have temp why and then all of a sudden you find their leader is the same way so if your pastor that believes that days of the Miracles are passed you will also find you don't believe in miracles and that's why we left denominations because our leaders did not believe the full councel of the world and we are not in the message to make another denomination we are in the message Amen to follow the right truth the right word and the right word must produce the right results hallelujah amen and and how can we know the right Ministry you see can only know by following the trend the pattern that has been set before so we should and and so I have a few pictures that I first of all want to share with you so you can be able to see how the Gentile church has been formed first we are going to look at it in the perspective of the generation of the age and so if you look at I know I have been referring to this but never reading it but today I want to take a a little time and read it go to the Book of Revelation as brothers you prepared in the pictures online and here um a Revelation chapter one everyone there if you there say Amen uh vers 9 there there's a lot we can read from right from verse one but um in the interest of time let us read from verse 9 I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the Kingdom of and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called partimos for the word of God and for the testim of Jesus [Music] [Music] Christ don't forget that John was cast to the aisle of pmos as an an an outcast it was a sentence is the I think the only one of the Disciples of Jesus that died a natural death all the others were killed but this one they could not kill him and so one time they put him in oil in a drum full of oil you know because of what he believed brother you must be ready to die for what you believe you must not let the devil rob you from what you have received what we have received is nonnegotiable this message is not NE we cannot accept anyone to formulate it into a denomination neither can we accept to submit to man inside of the world this message is much bigger than a man this message is Christ it is God revealing himself in our generation and so John they couldn't kill him there's no one that can kill that God out of you and so they they boiled him in oil and the man could not burn the man in the morning they found he was just there dancing I'm rejoicing night and day as I W [Applause] Up ab Hallelujah he abides with me I'm rejoicing night and this man is rejoicing in the O the same God of the three Hebrew children is the same God of John the same God of John is our God today as long as we believe the same word that they believe is a miracle working God amen amen the devil will do a lot of things to try and kill that life of the word in us but he cannot he cannot because Jesus said amen that all the gates of hell shall not Prevail against the church what does it mean it means all the gates of hell will be against the church who is the church I am the church you are the church the devil will try he will bring sin and if you overcome sin he will bring other Temptations If you overcome them he will try to kill if he doesn't kill you he will try to make you Mone and when you are poor you will feel desperate and he will try to bring you depression but when that doesn't work he will try all he can if you are married he will bring issues in your marriage you know he will try whatever he can but we have the word all hell shall not Prevail why because we are the church triumphant we are made in such a way that we shall always overcome hallelujah amen the devil cannot do that anything with that one amen I'm so they tried to burn John but they couldn't burn John and they say this man now he's a witch you know when a witch tries to be witht you and Witchcraft can't cat you they call you a witch they called joh a witch they said this man is a witch oil can't kill him they do not know the God in us is stronger than all witchcraft by the way believers never fear witchcraft does witchcraft have power oh yes it does but we have a power greater than the power of we have a power we have a God we have a spirit that is dwelling within us it is the power that is greater than all witchcraft that have for never bow down to witchcraft stop singing the song of Witchcraft go beyond it and realize the power of God you and so we see here that John was banished and they sent him to the aisle of pmos Hallelujah and when he reached pmos because they knew now this man will die pimos is a very bad place where there were scorpions snakes poisonous snakes poisonous rats and everything you can think of and you know anything that goes there dies anything but John was not anything the devil knows anyone that comes in his in his um Garden Saturn is Aiden dies but I am not anything I am here in s aen to win to overcome amen I believe that for me and for you if you believe and so John when he reached the a of pus you know they thought he would die but what is John's testimony John says I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation don't worry if you have tribulations in your life John is your companion but John overcame you will overcome Hallelujah he says I was on the aisle of partimos for what for suffering for dying for punishment for depression I was on the a ofus for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ the devil sees suffering John sees the word of God the devil sees death amen John sees the test Tony of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah hallelujah it does not matter what Satan sees about your life some people they dream a dream and they get terrified snake was Ching after me it means I'm going to die I saw you know myself doing this it means this is going to happen come on if the devil if God shows you what the devil is seeing it is because he wants you to see what he sees in you don't always be like a chicken you are always threatened by dreams you are always threatened you are the one when you see a cockroach means come on go beyond that fear we are not given the spirit of fear Hallelujah you must have a sound mind to know the word of your day when you you receive a revelation of the word of your and the ministry with which under which you are sitting then you will not fear because you know this ministry of the word of the hour is one that is sure to take people to Heaven it is not just information some people thought that this message is just information I wish I had time listen is more than information it is the power behind the word okay let's continue first of all saying I am Alpha and Omega I was in the spirit of the Lord this day and I had behind me a great voice as of a trumpet I was in the spirit when on the Lord's day they say the Lord's day is what Sabbath Saturday that's what they say John says he was in the spirit on the Lord's day and everything written in the Book of Revelation John saw it on the Lord's Day do you know how long these Revelations took how many years two to three years I think something like that several years so the question is the Lord is day is how long I thought it 24 hours no John is trying to show us something the Lord is day is not Saturday anymore after the resurrection of Jesus Christ the lord is day is the spirit when you are in the spirit you are in the Lord's Day the Lord's day is the holy spirit that's why every believer must receive the holy spirit because when you receive the Holy Spirit you are in the Lord this day 365 days of your of your of your you are in the Lord this day every day of your life you are in the Lord this day even today for me it is the Lord's day just be in the spirit and you will walk in the Lord's day and when you get into the Lord is day you will see Visions you will see dreams dreams you will see hear prophecies and tell prophecies and see T hear T interpretation and oh I love the Lord is day there is Supernatural in the Lord is day I know some didn't get it but maybe the future we will get to explain it more praise the name of the Lord saying I am Alpha and Omega that's the voice of the trumpet I am the first and the last what you see write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia andto Ephesus andto and I turn to see the voice that spake with me Hallelujah can I have the first slide amen I turn to see the voice that SP with me and I wanted to hear what John says and in the midst um and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks I saw one like the son of man Clos with a garment down to the food and got about the PS with a golden G his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire praise the name of the Lord and he had in his right hand verse 16 Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two EDG the sword and his countenance was the was the sun was as the sun shinest in his strength listen to verse 17 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right uh hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead behold I am alive forever more amen and I have the keys of hell and of death I believe that Jesus is telling us this morning the same words because his word Never Dies so no matter what you are going through fear not fear not and he told him write the things which thou Hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be here after did you see that the things right the things which you have seen the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter so whatever John is going to speak about is for the future that is how we know that these churches of future generations of the gentle Church vers 20 The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sest in thy right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars the angels of the seven churches everybody say angels of the seven churches the seven it says and the seven candlesticks which thou sest at the seven churches can I have the first slide now praise the name of the Lord and so he speaks about the seven churches and he says these are seven churches because they were represented by candlesticks one called Ephesus another one another and he said these are the things to come the angel told him these are the things to come but remember every church had an angel because there are seven stars are you following me and every child had a star all right and every Star was the angel of that church so we have seven GLE churches and remember this is the same Church of Jesus but we are talking about Generations or periods of time from from the first to the last and I will show you here in perspective so now we see that each church had a star tell your neighbor each church had a star each church had a star and the people of that church it was a m for them to follow that star because that star was in the hands of Jesus the star did not have its own light but it was shining the light of the sun the Sun s o n how many I enjoying this and so in every age we have that star but many churches don't know the star of their generation but I'm so glad this morning we know the star of Our Generation we know where we are standing we are more than a church we are more than a group of people who are following some organized writings we are a people that have a star Angel message Hallelujah give me the next slide and so we see here on this next slide you know a period here when the Holy Ghost came the Holy Ghost baptism you know and the people were filled with Holy Ghost and this was after Jesus Christ had already gone but I want to remember that the Jews had a time which we talked about here a timeline called the um uh the uh uh the 7even weeks of Daniel because Daniel saw this in a vision God by the ministration of an Angel Angel Gabriel God told um who is this man Daniel through Angel Gabriel the times that his people who are his people the Jews The Times They were going to have until the end the times we going to have until the Millennium the angel Minister those things to the Prophet Daniel and Daniel said it is 70 weeks that God had revealed to him through Angel Gabriel and we know these are weeks of years so 49 something years but we understand the last week because you know the Messiah was cut off are you following me I want to bring it as simple as it can be the Messiah was cut off right in the middle of the last week who is the Messiah Jesus but when the Messiah was C at that time the time of the Jews was paed when was the Messiah that is when Jesus was killed by the Jews you remember when they said let his blood be upon us and our children he is there in the in the gospels and they took him on the cross and he died because the Jews gave him up they rejected him and they cut him off and from that time God was no longer now God stopped working with the Jews when you reject Jesus he stops working with you he's a gentleman and Jesus is the word when you when you close the word outside God sees to work with you and that's what the denominations have done over the years they Clos the word outside and so when Jesus died you know how long was his ministry his ministry actually started this the last week because he was Min and he ministered for three years and a half so for three years and a half Jesus was ministering physically on Earth are you following me and his ministry covered the first half of the last week of the Jews so how long then are the Jews remaining for God to work with them three years and a half if you're following me say Amen now we see that when the Messiah was C according you go in your own free time and read Romans 11 according to Romans 11 he shows us the dispensation of the Jews and the [Music] Gentiles and he says that you know the the Jews were the original branch which was of course connected to Christ the word cuz he is the vine and they were the original branches but when they unbelieved or they rejected him they were cut off and then Jesus hallelujah amen he went in the forest hallelujah amen glory hallelujah hallelujah amen he went in the forest and he found another tree and he cut off that branch and he brought it and he grafted it where the original Branch was hallelujah amen and and the Bible now says who are the wild brch you and I the Gentile church we are the wild Branch we have been grafted on but in Romans 11 it says don't boast don't boast you do not own the tree but you are owned by [Music] it it is the one holding you the life you have is not your own it is from the tree coming from the roots the life we live is not our own it's the life of Jesus it is not a denominational Church life it is not a the a theological kind of life it is a life of the word the life of Jesus Christ and he said if the original Branch could not be spared because of unbelief how much more are you who are wild by Nature you will be cut off without even a thought but he says don't worry it is when until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in what is the fullness of the Gentiles the fullness of the Gentiles is the seven Church [Music] ages tell tell your neighbor the fullness of the Gentiles is the seven Church ages so now Israel has nothing to do with the church ages the church ages are for the gentle church but you see right from the day the Holy Ghost came down then the first day counted for the for the first church age Hallelujah and who was the angel of the first church age it was Paul hey are you getting it and from this we are now going to see the pattern of every true Ministry from among the Gentiles it all began with Paul that is how we are able to know the True Church the true Ministry the true faith and we see after the church ages then comes the Rapture the Rapture of the church we are going to be C up tell your neighbor I am going to be I am going to be C in a twinkling of an eye I am now in first Thessalonians CH 4 we will be C the Bible says we shall not all die but we shall all be changed in a twinkling of night we are waiting for that day Hallelujah that is a promise and when it comes we will be CAU up our bodies Our mortality will be swallowed up of Life Hallelujah am Hallelujah my God I am feeling my theop right now I'm connecting with it brother that's why when you are in the spirit you connect with your you feel spiritual that's why I don't believe in any motionless religion my God no our Prophet say if your religion is emotionless it is dead he will give you another one with emotion around hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah that's why when we connect with the word we are connecting with our theop and we get excited amen and this body can sweat it can shake why because there is something Beyond this body that you are connecting with that is the body you would have when you are chain in a twinkling of we don't know how he is but when he com we shall be like him hallelujah amen hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord and so friends we see that the Rapture is going to come and when the Rapture comes all the wicked all the those that um you know are sinners will be left behind the look one believer they will be left behind they Hypocrites they will be left behind I don't want to be left behind be filled with the holy spirit it's the only way Brother The Rapture is going to come soon and I will tell you why short why the Rapture is coming soon after the Rapture now hey m Listen by the way our message is at until the rupture every sermon we preach about after the Rapture every teaching that we teach that is within the phase after the [Music] Rapture it is just for our knowledge but but what you need is before the Rapture so we'll talk about tribulation it's for our knowledge just because the rapt has already happened so we preach tribulation just in case some people don't make it they will know what to expect some people they don't want to hear this other message and when you begin to about the tribulation they very attentive because they know where they are going but I know where I am going I am going up y to be with my Lord I want to be attentive I want to know how to receive the Holy Ghost I want to know how to believe the right SE I want to know the true Ministry so that I will make it in the Rapture praise the name of the Lord and then during the tribulation of the Gentiles that's when the two prophets Elijah and Moses will go to the Jews and those Jews will receive their message also the same message we have received the message of the Holy Ghost they shall receive hallelujah amen they will prepare the 144,000 elect juice and so we see many things will happen after that I say I don't want to waste time with that we shall be there and you will know where you belong and during that time the bride will be there in heaven and after all the tribulation and the third world war which is amagon you are seeing what is happening in Iraq in America isra Iran these things there's something cooking you see they say now you should not escalate don't escalate because they have all fearing the third world they know what kind it will be nuclear war they even telling Iran don't don't make nuclear war nuclear weapons don't don't don't because they fear because this one is like a terrorist State because they they just you know they want to unhate or remove the Jews and and so they want they want to be ruled by sh is it called whatever and so the the regime in Iran is not after democracy and so America is feared for Iran to possess a nuclear weapon and and Israel is also fear if Iran possesses a nuclear weapon we are gone they will wipe us but you see there's something I want you to understand America is on the side of Israel and will always be but you see America is the greatest superpower militar mil [Music] speaking but Russia is not on the side of America Russia is also great superow so I want you to now see the world geopolitics and we see that you know America is trying to you know normalize Israel with nations of the world but you see somehow there others who hate Israel the only reason is Israel should not exist they want to wipe Israel out of the map they want to kill everybody there that's why on October 7th you know they just you know weapons they just shoot from Hamas you know from Gaza they just shoot all those bombs or whatever it is on Israel they want everybody to die you saw what Iran also did they sent nuclear not nuclear but Cruise missil they went in just a few minutes you know Israel has what you call um I do not know how they call it Iron Iron Dome I think and so when the when misiles come it it shoots and then they hit those misiles in the sky but this time around when Iran shoot them many of themed they landed and now that infiltrated Israel said we're going to bomb them were going to show them fire now everybody was waiting what are they going to do because see what they were going to do don't think I'm telling you military science this is the Bible I'm in the Bible now if we want to know our timeline we need to look at Israel need to know this you know timeline so we see you know Israel now with a lot ofer they wanted to bom IR if they had done that Iran would also with all their come and B and maybe how dare you do that I'm going to show you fire and Russia was going to come China was going to come up and they begin to allow to do the alliances like it was in the first world war and in the second world war and it will become a World War World War that is what is going to come but what happened that's why you were seeing you know the leaders of America flying into Israel you know please please don't don't don't escalate don't bomb their nuclear energy don't also bomb you know their oil please please please please and then they okay so they also say if you bomb them we shall not defend you so they say okay so they bombed them but they bombed only the military factories and the other ones were angry but not as angry as they would have been and at the same time America is telling Israel is telling Iran okay don't rate if you detate we will show you fire so in other words they're trying to calm everybody but let me tell you there is a war raging time is coming and when they will not calm down when they will have to fight but that war the moment America comes Russia comes Europe comes it's a nuclear war it will finish this world in a minute and the Bible says it's actually the one going said the amdon will clean up the world for the Millennium the will be prep the civilization as we know it today it will be wiped CLE everything removed everything removed it is coming third world war but you see it can't find me here hallelujah the bride is caugh up can't you understand jesus takes care of his bride Jesus Minds about his hallelujahs about his business is me his business I am his business hallelujah hallelujah amen and because of that he said the Seven Stars to prepare us for being CAU up anybody who will follow that star will not go in the tribulation anybody who truly genuine follow that will be filled with the Holy Ghost and this will prepare them for the catching away following a St important if you don't follow a star you get lost how many remember these words we have seen his star and we have come to worship him when Jesus was born no one knew where he was no one who knew who he was but there were wise men three wise men from the East oh my good yes Hallelujah three wise men and when they came they came following a star why were they wise because they could find out the type of start follow it was a North star and they followed the star they followed the star and the star was leading them to where Jesus was to where the Messiah or prophecy was going to be born but when they reached Jerusalem somewhere they met the king and all the priest and they were confused a bit that's why Brothers don't ever be confused by denominations huah or even by preachers even preachers can mislead you or confuse you always read the message on your own know the message if you just hear what I'm saying you you will be lost be like the bans after hearing what the pastor is it like that we are not religious all of us should dip in the oil each of us we should dip our weak in the oil are you following me and so when they reached there they were misled and they were telling them nonsense denominations only have nonsense to say that's true and so this man was telling them the king you what what are you where are you going we are going to meet the Messiah even me have been wanting no he did not want he wanted to kill you because he was protecting his kingdom the denominations are are protecting their kingdoms they know that this message is not of this world so we have no kingdoms to protect and so they he told them when you see him please let me know so I may also worship him but they were wise I said they were wise they said they didn't go back they didn't go back some of you are wise you left denominations and he won't go backen Hallelujah yes sir we know what we have found Hallelujah I have found him whom my soul so long as gra Jesus satisfies my long through his blood I am saved and we see the the wise men when they left the palace the star reappeared when you go to denominations the star will disappear don't waste time in their books don't waste their your time on watching their sermons you are better spend your time with the word because if you waste your time the start disappears from and when you leave the star you are sure to be lost are you following me are you following me and then the star reappeared ah they were happy the Bible says they were exceedingly joyful because the star appeared that's why we are excited when we talk about the prophet of Our Generation why because we know it is not about the star it is about the direction of the star hey hallelujah amen that is what we excited about so when we caugh William BR it is not because of William Bram we excited it is about where he is pointing us and the star appeared and the star LED them and finally they met Jesus the Lamb of God hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and there some men who once came under this inspiration and Leadership of this star of Our Generation and they believed it and they were following it and time came when they reached the palace they saw the money they saw and then they said I no longer follow the star that we think they more wiser they foolish Gans 3 whatever I'm saying is in the Bible don't sayans they started in the spirit you find someone who has been preaching the message 20 years 30 years then they say and they they go on on YouTube and whatever why I left the message with their big bellies they never fast and pray you left the message you can live but for me I'm wise I am following the St I know where I am going I know where I am going I am going in the Rapture hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord and so we see the church ages will be for a period of seven um seven Church ages the gentle dispensation will be for a period of seven Church [Music] ages give me the next the last slide praise the Lord and so we see here seven golden candlesticks and the Seven Stars and so we see here each each age each Church age with the star there who are the stars Angels who are the Angels Messengers men on Earth prophets God used men God will use men God will always use if you don't want to believe a man and follow a man you will never know Christ that's the truth the program of God is he uses a man to speak to a man and when man believes then he will see God you remember that man who was in um in hell in hell he cried in hell he suffered and then he was being alone with the with all you know the tears and he saw Abraham he said Father Abraham I fast please send Lazarus to give me some water and you know I always use that scripture to say don't don't die poor even when you believe of theth you will make it to heaven but even those like that ruler in hell he despised the brother who was in heaven and he wanted to use him as a servant send him down because he knows he was a beggar on Earth don't be a beggar brother The God Who who gives you salvation is able to give you an idea and then he prospers you an idea of business you ask for money money is not reigning from Heaven he will give you an idea build on it and you build wealth amen s Lazarus and so then he said no sorry there is a big um you know we cannot be able to pass from he said okay forget about that thing now I have one more request let me let me go and warn my brothers when they see a man from Heaven they will believe you know he became a preacher in don't wait to become a preacher begin preaching now begin witnessing now this one became a preacher not only a Believer but even a preacher of the of the let me go and tell them and warn them of the impending danger that they may not come here AB don't worry don't worry yourself you see on Earth they are men they are preachers if your people hear them they will be saved and they won't come where you are are you hearing what I just saying on Earth they are made preachers people God is using God always uses People for People praise the name of the Lord otherwise if we do not understand that we even begin to fear mentioning brother bham say I can't fear to say I'm going to tell you what he said and I'm even going to read it for you because he is God's star for Our Generation go back in your Bible every messenger that came quoted other Messengers how did Daniel know the age he was in he read another Prophet before him he said I was reading was he reading Jeremiah or Isaiah Isaiah yes I was reading Isiah so so Daniel you telling us about prophet Isaiah yes because The God Who used him used Isaiah and we see Jesus also quoting other prophets we see John Isaiah who are you John The Voice crying from the Wilderness those are not your words John where did you get it from Prophet Jeremiah prophet Isaiah say it Hallelujah so a true ministry will not fear to quote the words of a true Prophet we know them in our generation big men soal Apostles and Prophet they cannot quot William Bram but they speak his words every time they even title their sermon the titles of brother and then we hear them but we know the truth they're trying to meand claiming they have their own Revelation but they stealing it from the message if any preacher claims to believe this message and he doesn't quote it he's a hypocrite he's not a Believer why am I saying that I'll tell you why they did not know one God before coming to the message right they did not know baptism in the name of Jesus Christ before they came to the message right they did not know about Holiness they didn't know because they didn't do it before they came to the message right they did not know Church order before they read what William bam say they did not know that women are not supposed to be pastors before they came to the message their wives were preaching but when they came they now corrected that and now all these things I'm saying are in the Bible but they didn't know it why they were blind the star will open your eyes will lead you now when they have come and they refuse to quote what the prophet is saying they claiming I believe the Bible no please shut up you don't believe the Bible because if you did you would have believed the man God used to reveal it for you by saying you believe the Bible but you don't believe William Bram it means you do not have a revelation of what the word of God is because what you the revelations you have did not come from Heaven flying it it came through a man by claiming you believe what I'm preaching but you don't even want to identify yourself with me as your pastor there is a problem somewhere but you won't shy away my pastor said right same thing here you cannot believe the message and reject the man you cannot reject the man and believe the message it is one and the same thing you see the the the angels Paul was the one to the Ephesian Church age Iranians to Martin to Pumba Sisley to Philadelphia and William Bram toia now was meaning aim that and then theyed we see came from a word which means a substance which embalms the death and it was bitter so we see this generation of was you know having those two things bitterness and death not time to go into the details pamos you know the word pegamos means married that time that season you have the years there you see the church married with the [Music] state and they became one they married and the first pop was instituted we see where it came from this church which mared with the state became the state church and it was a must belief in their false doctrines and we know the trines be come up and water baptisms and scap came much later and many other things we see that Thea is the dominating female at that time it is the Dark Ages the church almost had no other religion but Roman Catholicism and if you do not believe what they thought they killed you they killed Millions I can say this in public domain because I can prove it even if I'm taken to God it is known church history it is the truth one of the popes recently came up to apologize more than 60 million I think 68 million Christians but we see when sadis came by a man called Luther Who was the St messenger of that age we see that sadis means the escaped ones this man was a priest in the first chch system he escaped it and he began preaching the J shall live by faith alone in Christ not the Catholic church and many followed him and the Reformation of the church started amen and we see you know and by the way all the moves we of God but we see that denominations were being [Applause] formed when this these same movements organized when they organize they die God is not in organization God is in his word that is why the message churches we don't even know how many they are in the world because we are not an organization we don't register anybody bring the church register brother to be a full member do ABC pay this amount of money no we have no membership and we mean it we have no membership but we have Fellowship hallelujah amen and we see sadis is the escaped on they escaped and formulated you know a move reation but you see later on they they be made a Luther and organization and we see later on Philadelphia philia brother age of Brotherly kindness brotherly love this was a great missionary era at time we in school we were studying about the missionaries it is around the 1700s between that and the 19th century they went in India Africa wherever to to spread the gospel of love and Christ T about Jesus and love one another and things you know but through this age God also used the man John wisley and John wisley preached the message of Works he said you know well you cannot claim that you you are Justified but yet your works are still but you're smoking you're drinking no no no no no you have to be change and so it was mly about that how can you claim that you are a follower of Jesus and you cannot sacrifice your life and go out and do something for God and preach the gospel God was with that move it was a move of God and LU sorry wisley was a messenger he was AAR of that generation and you know you know the word of God went around the world and we see that later on they formed methodists and they organized they stated and they die and God kept on moving on Friday we talked about a man called William Sim he was a black brother in America God used him in such a mighty way at the beginning of of the Year 1906 you know we see that you know uh it started thean Church age but the Pentecost move already been going on and you know this man they begin crying and Desiring to see Acts 2 fulfilled in their life they wanted to see the supernatural they wanted to see the signs and wonders they wanted to see what they saw in the Bible only just shall by faith and only good works we also want to see the power the signs and wonders the tongu interpretation and prophecies and we wanted to see those things and you know what God came down ATA Street and began filling them with the Holy Spirit they began speaking in Tong that was a real genuine thing it should have been the True full restoration but it was not because it lacked another ingredient it had the SS of the Dynamics the power of God the S wonders the tongues the healing but it did not have the restoration of the word and oh my I have a lot to tell you but I don't know whether you can take it all can you give me a few more minutes all right and there God had to send another Angel this Angel was not coming with his own idea but his main work was to restore the word are you following me praise the name of the Lord means people's rights and this is the generation we living in people no longer desire anything about God they have their rights let them have their rights but you see those who fear God love will stick with the word more than their rights and in Malachi 4 verse 5-6 he says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful devil and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smile the Earth to the C so we understand please give me your attention for the few more moments we understand that this Elijah the prophet is come to the world five times first elah the second elah thirdly John the Baptist that is the one the Bible speaking about here before the great day of the Lord but there is another one who is supposed to come before for the Dreadful day of the Lord can you go behind the second before the great the Dreadful day of the Lord there is an Elijah supposed to before the Rapture before the tribulation is an Elijah supposed to come Hallelujah before that day of the Lord comes before the tribulations before the rapture just at the end of the Gentile dispensation there will be an Elijah Prophet who will come and his work will be the simplest he will not start anything new he will not bring any new teaching he will not bring any new idea but his work is simple to restore Hallelujah everything the apostles preached to bring it back again to the church so that the people can be prepared for the Rapture praise the lord we are children of God our hearts by that Elijah's message give me the next that last one of the last churches through the ministry of William brother who is he he is our star for our hallelujah hallelujah amen he's our star are you following William br oh yes because he's my star but don't you worry he's not the big deal here I am following him God is leading me somewhere he's leading me to the word he's leading me to Christ not to himself not to his church but to Christ and here is one thing they don't understand the ministries of the prophets have three pools every say three pools come on tell your neighbor three pools but people don't understand the first pool is the miracles signs and wonders that was in the ministry of Jesus Christ when he started out oh people loved it and wonders God mirac being turned [Music] everybody came it attracted thousands second pool designment people reduced a bit but still many we see Jesus designing nathani we see him designing the woman of the well we see him telling Peter his name your name is so and so problem is this and this people loved that is a man of God William is a man of God all these Pentecostals you goarch about them they talked great big things about why because of the first pool of his and the second pool now what we call pools his faces what was pulling people to his ministry but when it comes to the third phase of his ministry just like Jesus many walk away after he did all the Miracles he now said he that will not eat my flesh and drink my blood is not part of me the ones who were saying amen say Amen they began they walked out Jesus was wondering the church is becoming empty where are the people going am I not a powerful preacher said no you offended them those things those words we have strong they they not used to it and then Jesus also told do you also want to go my disciples go now what made them stay in this third pool one thing Peter answered to whom shall we who has the word etal that brother that sister that is the reason why we leaving this message hallelujah amen we are not even here for just Miracles we are here because of the word the opening of the word the revealing of the word when William Bram reached the third phase of his ministry the ones who are saying is a great big man Mighty Man of we don't want you to preach for us no we we're no long associating with you why because he simply preaching what the apostles preaching and he said I am responsible for this world he said they have been pulling me to join their denominations I cannot join it you have to understand we have a message to preach he said I cannot join anything we only are responsible to the message God has given us and this message is not just information this message is preparing the bride for the coming brid hallelujah amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen there is something that comes with the opening of the world something else something else you know what comes with it with it comes the Power with it comes the supernatural amen speaking things into existence where is it the power of the third pH when is it active it is active now it is active now therefore what do you need receive it in the name of Jesus Christ whatever you have need of receive it in the name Jesus Christ Hallelujah that is the power of the third message is not only words there is a power behind it it is already active amen it is not coming it is here you believe it it is here does God fill with the Holy Ghost yes he does does God heal oh yes he does does God set free oh yes he does signs and wonders happening Miracles T interpretation that is our portion as true message Believers because we are under a true Ministry hallelujah amen come on give him praise [Applause] tend Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus that is what the devil doesn't understand that's where many many preachers this message that's where they have gone wrong that is where we have gone wrong where we believe the mechanics the word we believe the power this message also has power yes Hallelujah yes sir and by the way one of the qualities of a true Ministry amen is we see it in Apostle Paul and I want to wrap up now three things we already saw he was absolutely true to the world never deviated from the world no matter what give me that seven he never left the world he was true to the word if you want to know you are under a two Ministry that ministry will be Bible based give me the third one it will be word based this ministry will be true to the work it will never deviat it will never leave right from the beginning Paul said the pattern of that true Ministry so if we want to know the other Messengers The Other Angels it is easy you just find out Paul how was the nature of his ministry number one he was true to the world whatever he preached every messenger who will come his inspiration will fit in the same inspiration that Paul had he was true to the word he never deviated from it hallelujah amen Paul was speed amen not he was unorganized Spirit as when God moved upon Moses to lead up the children of Israel out ofp Jerusalem's counc never sent Paul out none of these Messengers was sent by any councel none of them was sent by any denomination in the second age there was a man called poop He was the spiritual father ofus but irus was a milit against the organization but he was leaning towards the world but you see polyup was leaning towards the organization and the spirit said he's not PO is not po God does not send organization to lead The Messengers all these men Spirit no C sent them out nor did it have any power or jurisdiction over him God and God Alone God sent Paul God sent Iranians God sent Martin God sent Kum God sent Luther Luther was in the system and he rejected the system he protested and protested movement started with him where do you get the authority I get it from the wall the man was obsessed with the word God sent Wiley God sent Bram Bram was in Baptist but when he received the revelation of Divine Healing and many other things his preacher told him he his preacher told him you are running crazy you have a problem he said all right let me go with the word I will still preach the word and all of them respected what he preached because it was the word Paul was not of men of God but there is a second quality his ministry was in the power of the spirit he was demonstrating the spoken word and the written word that's how you know true Ministry they will demonstrate not talk about demon the spoken word and the written word and when is I told you here is a Ministry of William BR is not a man who just spoke spoke spoke spoke he's a man who would preach and he would say he's here now the Holy Spirit I put every spirit in this room under my control for glory of God and then he would say for what I preached is the truth let him come and vindicate the god of the bible let him come and in a moment when he would say those words there would be silence just like we hearing now you could brother bisc said brother bisar is my mentor in the and and and he would say that you would even hear a need of falling on the ground when he said those words there was a harush over the congregation and then he would be silent and he had eyes if you see' seen his pictures like eag eyes inside and when he sees you or looks at you it would be like an ego then he would look over the congregation is watching the movement of the Angel and that angel was with us Friday night here hallelujah amen was yes and I believe he gathers around people who believe this message and then he would begin calling out people by name you say your name is Dixon you're from Ginger you're not from here now those not knowing those statement and he would go he would go more than that he would go into your mind into your heart you've been worried about your future you've been thinking about specific about what is happening in your and he would specifically and let me tell you this each of those times he never went wrong not once forget about what you're seeing these days from the TV prophets they miss they heit and Miss but for him never went wrong why it was God who was there doing it not the man where are the stars in the right hand of Jesus Christ it was him moving him around and then this designment you know until people could believe what he preached is the truth and you know he would preach and Crush women preachers and make and you know thism and then he would say if I preach the truth let God come for and vate and God came down each time and you you look at me now and you tell me William bam was a false Propet there's a problem with a very big problem Paul did not just preach he demonstrated what he preached through the power of the spirit hallelujah hallelujah and there was an evident fruit of that god-given Ministry now as I'm closing I want to finish with this people can debate the teachings that brother bam Tau people can debate the manifestations and the gifts but here is something they cannot de Paul the third quality that he had in his ministry to prove it was a true Ministry he had fruit in his ministry fruit now you you wondering what's fruit you shall know them by their listen to what Paul had to say I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have spoused you to one husband that I may present you the CH vir Christ I be if I be not an apostle unto others yet dless I am to you for the seal everybody seal of my apost are you in the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah amen I am become a fool in glory ye have compelled me for I ought to have been commanded for of you for in nothing I am behind the very chiefest of Apostles though I be nothing praise the name of the Lord Paul could be able to say these things to this people because Paul knew even at one point he said you have 10 you may have 10,000 instructors yet have you not many fathers and he said I have begotten you in the gospel you are the Seal of my apost I've espoused you to Christ I BST because of you that was Paul's fuit William Bram William Bram had fruit of the ministry and he knew oh my God he knew he had it before he did why because he was a prophet God spoke to him and God told record all the messages you're preaching because it will be food for my bride in the end time was that not a prophetic thing and brother would say these steps are listened to these steps are listened to by millions of people all over the world they are recorded and they are going to be translated into every language there in the forest and they'll be reading it amen am I communic someone we are the evidence Hallelujah if oh my God I feel like taking thanks right now I wanted to listen brother B was a prophet of God if someone doesn't believe that he is too late he's too late why you you cannot come now and claim he was a why because you are too late already there are people all over the world in every nation on Earth who have believed this message we are the evident FL of Mal that is not all when you see these people's lives their lives are changed they are filled with the Holy Ghost God is moving in their life God is doing the supernatural we are the evidence F of this true Ministry they are almost in every country on earth now that's not all devil that's not all there is more in these people God is proving himself yet again just like it was in the days of Willi the sick being healed the demon possessed are being delivered Sinners are being set free in this same Ministry in this ministry why the pill of fire which he claim to is still moving with these people same God signs and wonders are in abundance among them they speak in Tong I said they speak in and they interpret the same way the Bible say when the Pentecost say we just speak we just speak it is the spirit but the Bible say there should be interpretation and they said no and God sends William the Star Messenger to the last age and he preaches the message we are the fruit we are the fruit and everywhere this message is tongues are spoken and they are interpreted hallelujah amen why right we are the F preachers preach and God goes be behind them to confirm what they have said so much talking about the first prees in the message we don't have time for that now let's talk about the true ones God is still moving God still has churches all over the world it may even be in America yes you mean even Americans they can get excited speak T interpret them prophesy yes it's happening all over the world praise the Lorden hallelujah hallelujah amen why we are the fruit of the ministry of now let me tell you my brother when you hear someone say William Bram was a FAL Prophet tell them you are too late you are too late you are too late when they ask you why tell them I am the fruit of his ministry and also tell them I am not the only one I am not the only one there are many

minutes one or two minutes before we dismiss I just wanted there's an announcement we forgot to give to you at the beginning of the service and uh I've just remembered just now amen how many have been blessed and nourished amen let's give a clap of praise to our God [Applause] that was for your uncle give to the [Music] Lord amen we have good news uh there are many people who have been previous viously we have had um an online method of paying for the Youth Camp but now we have a better way uh we we have been able to register by God's grace the uh Merchant pay codes how do they call it merant IDs I don't know if that's a m and a I I I think it's going to be good news for many people we now can be able to uh just press a Cod do you have it here did you get it yes give it to us if you have it we can and you can also put it online brother I know there are people who um usually are following our services and uh they cannot I don't know which one are these it was indicated this is for what louder these are for offerings so there are people who follow us online and you would like to know how to participate you participate in the service but you don't participate in giving and that's not good for you it's good there's no worship without giving every worship has an offering according to the teaching of the Bible so we would like to announce that we have air pay and Momo pay these ones are for offerings H just write them down save it somewhere in your phone you can maybe you want to give a seed offering or whatever it is whatever if it is church service [Music] offering you sometimes you find like myself I come to church and I check myself I have no cash I'm like I forgot the money at home but I have my phone and I can give on my phone so from today I've been one those missing to give offering but from today God has opened a way for me I will no longer miss giving offing because I just have to go on my phone and send my offering and um uh also there have been people you have the others okay have you are these the new ones uh there have been people that have been sending me money for Ties on my phone number I um understand sometimes you're in the middle of the week you don't want to use the funds you can't wait until you come to church uh so you have to send it um but then I have a policy here that all offerings and ties are managed by our Treasures as much as the ti offerings are supposed to be for the pastor for the ministry of the word to what we are taugh but I always wanted to go through that so that we can be able to account uh by the end of the year we can be able to let you know look you gave this much you did this much but if you send it to me someone will call me as soon as you send it P I have an issue and I have to send that money away and the treasurers have missed out recording so because of that we would like all ties all tis to be given in two ways we have our TI here we shall get envelopes we working on them if you've noticed we are trying to Rebrand yeah on if you see on the website we've changed our Loos and we looking so we are going to get also envelopes for you so that from here you can be able to take it and whenever you want to give tis you put it in there if you have any prayer request as you're giving your type write it there I'll personally take that envelope the treasurers will bring it to me if there are any needs and I will pray for those need and um we've done that before and it works I believe it works and so um we will Avail those envelopes by Sunday alternative you can if you want to pay your tit in the middle of the week any time if you have it on your phone you can send it on thisch both the MTN M and the a you can write it down if you want to J it down on your phone or whatever and then uh uh okay I think that's these are these are for TI is right can we put again for the offerings okay these are the ones for offerings so if you want clarification you can come see brother Mone from theia department they will then these the ones for offerings now these Merchant cods are also going to be used for our youth camp the ones for tith are only for tith and people who want to give Fast fruits and like that you send on the ones for or you give in the but the ones for all other offerings we shall using these so including our youth camp so you the people who pledged here uh you can pay using this directly from your phone uh is that clear all the ples send it here so that look I don't have to touch the money uh the treasurers don't have to touch the money no one the money but we can they can be able to pull the statements and from here they go straight to the church account you know if you want to do accountability you cannot do it without doing this I'm a strong believer in accountability and so even not only the church even the other people who are paying for the Youth come they will be using this I think we have already put on the youth meetings they can begin paying ASAS now but please if you send any payment onl kindly send your message to the treasurers stand up brother stand up brother Joel yes and brother Baka was helping but he's now a little away I think he's not yet back so these brothers are the ones um helping on this work this is Brother Dan that's brother Jo after you make your online payment anything to do with tithe send a message to brother and any other offering send that message to brother Jo you can just send it on whatsapps whichever and then he can be able to concile it we shall post it properly on the church group for more clarification all right God bless you so much we need more pledges for the Youth Camp so for the Youth Camp so if you have not yet given your PL please meet uh uh one of the treasurers or or um well the treasurers can do or of the ministers here and give you a pledge and also those who pledged please fulfill your Pledge on time and you can also double your pledge and triple it there's no limit if you don't want a limit of your blessings you ought to have shouted Amen on that one amen I I I pledged something I'm I'm planning on doubling it the Lord enables me tripling it when we announcing these things it's not not for you it is for all of us we all give we give sometimes more than we have but God promised to bless us back amen and so I think with those words um we will also encourage you to please um I I heard which group is that that uh finally won Martin Luther who is the leader of that group oh my God let us give another hand wow wow group now that is a Revival the group lead of Martin Luther you have you have more work to do now I hear other group saying we are also coming that's the kind of thing we want and if you are part of the church and you're not contributing weekly don't wait until you get the big money please if you want to prosper hear me our God has already I told you here before that people who are giv towards this they're going to be rich how God will give them Grace and opportunities that he will give them Financial breakthrough because their heart is glued on the work of God and I said that and God speaks through a person who I have even understood later is not even a member of this church he says he she's a sister actually let me read this again um however in the next part of the vision the water transformed into Clean and Clear Water I believe that river is what I preached about here the other time and he said Fin and that's my prayer that the Lord will give us a river at this Fellowship that everyone who comes will drink and get drunk and their thir will be quenched and it says finally and I love this finally because he saying after he has done this after he has questioned then finally my God the sister picked a very powerful choice of words when I read it I could tell it was of the Lord I Saw The River overflowing with [Music] dollars by the way have you come to think of it not in Uganda shs you know all rich men don't keep Uganda [Laughter] Shillings they keep it in dollars because it is much so when you when you start your company and business as long as you give to the work of God you will earn in dollars now I saw the river overflowing with dolls representing an abundance of financial blessings the sister who saw this Vision like I said has not been a member of this church doesn't know what I've been preaching doesn't know what commments I've given I can only say this is god so let's believe it and exercise it so you're not giving to the land fund what are you waiting for you're waiting for the big dollars no it's coming to those who have been giving someone are saying I'm waiting for my seat to be big so I can give no your seed is it begins small you begin with one AC when you harvest then you you you plant again in youest in 10 AC you understand so that should be the progress amen amen now as I I'm I'm going to dismiss you many of our friends in this message I shouldn't even said it that way I should say we Believers we have been very poor over the years the reason is this area of that's why I don't care what people call me I know this thing is going online I don't care what they call me someone I heard say oh those people they love money we don't love money we don't love money we love this message we love God and look giving is not by force giving is Free Will out of the abundance of your I can't even say it a must no if you don't want leave it but of course you will harest but if you want to harvest these dollars don't just give give abundantly as God will bless you and you will see your financial sometimes when people give things go south money becomes challenged I mean they get challenged with money but Pastor told us we shall be it is your faith being tested continue giving and you know if the devil sees ah this one he has the Revelation he will leave you alone but if you you you get challeng and I will not give anymore you have a problem with your Revelation the Lord bless you greet one another greet one another and you all dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ yes the committee please stay back just changing a few things in the budget and then we shall dismiss you God bless you [Music] oh [Music] [Music] 2023 was a great time bringing together over 300 young people from three countries 2024 was another yet wonderful time with over 500 youth
