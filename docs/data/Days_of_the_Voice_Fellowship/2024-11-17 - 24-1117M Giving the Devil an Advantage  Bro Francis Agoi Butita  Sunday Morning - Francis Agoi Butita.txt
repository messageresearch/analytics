get in touch with sister Aga and maybe uh send us some condolence if you can that will be a good thing amen um also brother Alan uh informed me he will be at evening light he was invited by the church by the church there as they wanted to um stand try and stand with him in his upcoming wedding so I think they had some arrangements there uh so informed me to let you know um just one or two things before I invite the minister Jo I think because of time he forgot to announce the tottles um he forgot also to mention the 2,000 Shillings which was put in the offering bag the land fund and this week we have raised a total of 1 million [Applause] 284,000 amen uh make make sure you make this microphone better before the preacher comes is I can't hear myself so that's only for this week and then the

you for your efforts and all these other groups we really really appreciate God bless you for your giving and the leaders for mobilizing we shall attain this Vision only thing which can stop it is if the Lord comes quickly if Jesus comes tomorrow then will but if he comes if he delays to come I say we shall accomplish tell your neighbor we shall accomplish amen I see manys are not here this morning if you have talked to me and um I I calleded them those who SP spoke to me and told me that Pastor I'm not able to come I'm not able to come running this doing that and I scolded them because I I I think as um our Prophet told us we should be at the post our post of Duty and that is in our home church and especially when you see God sending us a visor from afar um I will spare you this morning I will not SC you because the VOR is here but when he leaves we will talk about it as a chch I think there's a few things we need to straighten out but you know to whenever you see a a preacher a Vista coming just know there a lot that goes in there's a lot of finances that as the host we have to incur there's a lot of sacrific and also finances as a v they Inc all for what say for me so if you don't show up when an announcement is given it is a big sh to you as a Christian but like I said we will I will deal with you afterwards but for this morning I don't want to SPO the atmosphere I'd like to just um you know um our hearts already prepared I'd like us to receive the preacher um I'm so thankful um you had a testimony from about sister praise it was so short but it was not easy you know she lost a lot of [Music] blood and twice they went to the hospital at one point even the blood her blood is a bit complicated I think it's all negative so find it was very difficult and uh she she couldn't even stand so to see how here this morning it is your prayers amen and we are so thankful this morning for the Lord who has enabled you sister to here this morning amen um so this morning to those of you who have not been following the services we are privileged to have Pastor Francis all the way from uh kosi Kenya we have been here uh on Friday how many were here on Friday how was the service tell your neighbor how it was I'm telling you you missed if you are not here we really had a jubilee and we were here yesterday doing an interview with him being that he's one of the elders in this message one of the very first Elders in this message in this region and we were privileged to hear his councel his words of wisdom his testimony encouraged us a lot and so for the for one more time this morning is going to preach to us and um straight away after the service he will leave so I don't expect any movement I want you to receive everything as I spoke to you on Friday uh this man byle he expected in his own words expected to make it he thought he would go because he was very sick they announced that he had cancer and the Saints prayed and this yesterday he gave to us a testimony how the Lord healed you and I tell you friends this message is real we Ser a Living God Jesus Christ is not a myth he's real and if God sped him I believe it is for me this

father we want to thank you this morning we thank you for the privilege to be assembled in your father as we approach your word we pray that your anointing will be upon word and may you speak to every heart for in Jesus name we pray amen H just before you sit down let's stand to Romans 6 verse 16 it says this though ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness amen the Lord bless you be seated uh I must say I'm very very very grateful this morning to be in your church um I have uh I have known brother for some time now he has been our church many times some of you have come there and I'm happy to come and pay the debt I may not pay fully but you know loans are paid in inst so this may be my first inst and I believe you will appreciate it amen I believing just after this service immediately I wish I could stay more but there's a brother who pick me from the border so I would like to leave immediately pray for me so that by around 6 at the border but I tell you I wish I could carry you home I really appreciate my wife rang yester my son also and my daughter- inw and they asked me to pass their [Applause] greetings prise the Lord we welcome you for our meetings when we have meetings please come when you had meetings here some of my young men came and for a few weeks I had a reval in my church praise the Lord this morning I want us to talk about giving the devil Advantage it doesn't look positive is it a good thing to give the devil an advantage you see says if you are in a contest you study your enemy you study the weak points and make advantage of the wi you you you you look at your Str strong points and take advantage you we strong points if there's two teams going to play let say foot and the opposing team will always take advantage of the other team if the back is weak the team is going to make maximum use of that wickedness if the team has a we goalkeeper the strikers are going to make use of that and if the if the weak if the team gives the opponent [Music] Advantage some of the Advantage they may give to the opposing team can rep some of the advantages they can give the opposing team is making silly mistakes within the dangerous [Music] Zone if you are going to handle the within the penalty area you are giving yourent an advantage so you avoid this silly mistakes around this dangerous Zone you don't play with the ball around the go because you give your open an advantage and so the devil and us are in a game and we Must Be watchful not to give him an advantage I believe in James 4 verse 7 [Music] if you can read it quickly this is what the Bible says are you there submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you and I want you to notice we like to say resist the devil flee but before you resist the devil you must submit to God if you don't submit you can't resist so the whole game is submitting and resisting you are not willing to submit you are playing a weak game and many people lose this game because they don't want to [Music] submit you don't want to submit to the word and when you don't meet the word the sisters the devil sees a weakness that he can't flee from you praise the Lord so you submit surrender to God surrender to his word and when you surrendered to God you were in a position to resist the devil when Jesus came to this earth [Music] he came surrendered glory to God he came completely surrendered to God and when the devil came to tempt because he was fully surrender Jesus could tell the devil get behind it is written it is written Hallelujah why did he win that battle because look at the river he surrendered to God and God filled his life so much so that he said this is my beloved Son whom I well pleased hallelujah hallelujah you are not going to resist the devil the rule of this game is that you must fully many people want Victory and many people want to speak great things but so long as the devil has a chance to hit long as there's an opening where the devil can you open a gap and the devilit [Music] you but the only way you can Mar to

Mage the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 111 it is your mind that opens up or cles the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affection when your mind closes itself and let God the spirit of his word and let God the spirit of his word come in it Blow the rest of the stff out the the decision to be who you are is in your an the decision to be a vict today your if you open your mind IM you know what im do if you depend on imagination you can't have faith do you remember the children of Israel they came from Egypt and they reach the Red Sea and they looked behind let me put it this way do you know your body has five senses and those five senses are not good for your spirit your eyes your ears yourse your T your cannot make you a very strong believer and the devil knows that he has Advantage there did you know your spirit has five senses memory imin reason which one is one you have them in the message did you know those five spiritual senses canot help you spiritually do you know your imagination gives the devil advant when you are sick your IM going to die right say because you your imagination shows you your funeral and you wonder what will I do now when the children isra were coming from Egypt and they reached the Red Sea and they saw the Egyptians their imagination worked they were not dead but they saw themselves dead they were not dead and they they have nowhere to be IM right right your imagination will tell youe so long as you are feeding on that the devil has an advantage you you see you imagine young man how can a young man survive imagine I imagine I imagine and many men have def their because the devil right so your mind opens up you let the door of your mind open and you open up the devil the Devil comes in you know your mind is a f and this is where the two forces spiritual forces [Applause] meet this is where the ARs of the devil be short this is where the arrows of the world will be SH now if you open the door to the devil the devil will coner you right let me read it more see it is your mind that opens up opens up the door the door and listens to your conscience your conscience is so bad do you know the reason why many people don't believe the what the word says because maybe through life they passed through difficult moments their lives have been Scar and these scars have gone in the conscience and so why they are Christians every time they want to make a move the devil go subconscious maybe something so bad and the devil does not want you to believe that God forg he wants you to believe you are still a and let me tell you if you are here and you suffer that I want to tell you in Romans 81 therefore there is no now no condemnation that are in Christ sins are forgiven you are forgiven glory to God listen you know what that means that God took your when you came at calary you forgetful and they fall fall they have been falling all this time the devil can't retrieve them because he dare not go near that sea that sea of blood that God God you know what God did you know what God did he went to the files the file the F and I give me devil from [Music] your give me's [Music] files for he has come to me amen and he said he saw and I forgiv now devil hand over the fire and he took the record the record that was against you he went up that hill and reached Calvary and took those records [Music] huah am the so let not the devil remind you when God forgives he forgets and God does not remember what you did hallelujah amen but you know what the devil does he goes into your memory and scratches your memory and tells you the one who did this and did you do this and you the one who and you feel oh I'm so bad remember you are Justified and when God [Applause] justifies so if you open your memory you open your imagination you always be a down do you have I'm speaking to you now the reason why you are down you are giving the devil Advantage by opening up your memory open up imin you open up your Reas you know you have to be reasonable just somebody like you it is not possible and he makes you not believe what God I want to ask you today who are you going to believe or do you believe God you believe what God says about or you believe what the devil says about [Music] you oh I remember that man who got saved and he was as how do you feel today I feel I feel wonderful how how is it says there are two big dogs in my house one is white the other one is and they are fighting which one is winning depend the one I'm feeding if I feed the white he WIS I feed the and I want to tell you it depends who you feeding who are you feeding the one you feed win the Holy Ghost wi you yourh will win you open up your mind or you close the door of your mind you listen to your conscience listen to your memory listen to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word It Blow the rest of the stuff out you can blow everything out whatever the devil bu your whatever the devil has told you about yourself the problem with the church today they believe more When God says you are his son the devil tell you you are so many weaknesses can't have a child like but let me tell you something but he says you are his his jeans are in [Applause] you his seed is in you his character is in you praise the Lord Praise Jesus why does he want you not to believe with your father why doesn't he want you to believe you believe your father done if you believe your father if you believe what he says about praise God so if you open to the spirit of his word it blows everything out I want the devil to be blown out of my mind I want his work to be blown out of my life every doubt every fear is God every sensation of the devil every feeling is God there is nothing standing there but the word of God when you open the spirit when you say I stand with the spirit when you say I Take God as his word everything the devil has put in your life is blown up to God can't score go you broke you've defend you made a strong defense when you give chance the word where the where is the child that give God a chance where is the church will give God's word a chance that will go and take the message listen we have message a and message B and message B message a revelation 10 1 that is hisory message B Revelation 8 108 to1 supposed to be here today where are the people who come and message who can go and say I believe what God say I a child of God give me that book give me that book it is my possession it is mine give me that book and sit down and that hallelujah amen message B is about the book message B message a is passed message but message a brought us message and the church in message B are not only talking about message a they actually sit at the table and they have taken the book because they know if they take the book and they put the book in it will blow out the works of the dev it will destroy everything the devil put in their memory and to into trash and make them stand and be where message Hallelujah this is what will make you be Christ the of Christ this is just what I'm seeing Oh what are you see this praise God praise God and spiritually spiritually you are [Applause] what your spirit is formed by what you eat if you take the word of God into Spirit it out everything that is not and forms the image of Christ oh praise God so what am I looking at today I can see because this people at Christ word and in them what is sitting in them is Christ [Applause] himself so listen we don't give the devil Advantage we can't open our mind and Satan cannot battle against that that no no word is in when the word is Tak the seat when the word has Tak that remember Jesus said when a demon is cast out of somebody he goes out to find place and when he does not find I'll go back to my house he comes and find that nobody sitting on are there some people who who have space that is a dangerous place to be because when he sees there is space nobody sees he goes to bring seven more and he comes and this a and he cleared himself he threw away for he left his his drinking his life his everything else was clean what mistake did he do he didn't open the door for somebody to come in come in Christ the Holy Ghost to come and when you stay as a believer in the church and the Holy Ghost is not in your life you are giving the devil an advantage over have you ever wondered people get sick and they were so happy they when but after some time quiet and what they do when they were making noise they were the front they now to the back of and you are the back because you an ADV the devil and you lost something that's right praise the Lord I hope you're not there for that reason but listen you see people shout they happy when the word is then something happen and they keep quiet and when the preacher is coming is as if he coming to circumcise it's Grievious is Grievious and you want what happen in my church I can tell you so and so it's because you see them you see them they let somewhere and the devil took yes sister take advantage of you I remember one time in my I was going to preach I woke up in the morning prepared very well went w every shirt I took there was something wrong with it was something the call was not and I went through all the church and I thought what is wrong to yes he will take advantage of small things before he can take advantage and wants you to have a before the simplest thing is to tell your what is wrong with you and have a small exchange and he has an advantage and when you come to church you are condemned how many couples come to church because the devil raised something and made them qu in morning maybe through breakfast am I alone in that so I looked around every sh was B then I said it can't be the Roans wrong I'll take and whether bad or not and I se that he didn't have the advantage he couldn't make me have a he couldn't have have me defile my soul and go to church feeling guilty today you are because you give you let the devil work on your [Applause] children and when you and you come to church you live the whole Wicked you you are as good as because you the devil occasion who you say I'm very tired listen Jesus was very tired one time even when you are ti don't let TI let me quote this from Raising of J's daughter6 now on this little old sea 10,000 Devils of the sea so that they will drown him while he was laying back there tired you know the devil takes advantage of you you when you get tired he does you he does he does you the same you just get a little tired and out and get discourage praise the name of the Lord you get tired you get war and

advantage of that did you notice when you are tired you moody when you are tired you are frustrated you get disced what happens all these actions are spirits whatever trumpet and works on your flesh

whole day even came and children have not eaten the wife has not eaten and when came from the room she blew up I can't bear this and the children were crying and the toys were being thrown everywhere

can f our hands all that we need is more [Music] than Glory Hallelujah GL the greatest battle ever F 6231 [Music] paragraph paragraph let me see this paragraph 74 paragraph it says the spirit let's get it the spirit has one sense is either dominates it or doubt [Music] exactly and there is only one Avenue to e that is free moral you accept doubt or you can accept Faith either you one you want see therefore Satan begins at the principle part to call the spirit of man knows if I can here get here because there are two things faith if he believes I'm I'm finished if this man believes I'm finished so it is either he believes or he doubt do you know why what the does he preaches to you when he came to Adam in the G of Eden he came with a good maybe titled it what God today we are going to talk about said did God say you not eat of all the he said no he didn't actually say that he said we can eat over all the trees but except of the tree of that is in the middle of the garden the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that one we should not we do that we the devil say praise the Lord praise the Lord you will not surely die you will not surely die in other words God is not saying the truth be [Music] reasonable you not surely he just meant something in the in between and he right into the face is it and so she did what the devil did because she doubted what God Said She doubted she was surely and today can make you doubt what say what God says about your what God says about your what says about you the things you need what God says about your spiritual security God says about Grace what God says about your life if he can make you doubt your destiny and show you you are even lost already and God does not mean you are the people to go the people like you like you mean like is not for people and it makes you say okay yeah I can see I can see even my my history I came from I can see it is true it is true God could not be meaning somebody like me and once you accept what the devil is saying because you doubted God you doubt what God say God will come and take you Satan will come and take you and mess you up get in your mind because he God has given you the freedom to choose that is a very good thing you can choose to be a very spiritual sister God has given you the freedom and there are two choices there are two choices every question there are two choices there is God's choice and there's Devil's choice if you believe what God says you take What God Says and when you take what God says you have the victory you have more than a conqueror Hallelujah you are winner but if you look at what the devil is giving and you see the shadows and you see the doubt and you see the reason and your imagination brings you and your memory bring the past what the devil is a hisory and you will come around with your history and tell you what he used to be oh and tell you what he used to [Music] do me something praise the Lord come do you brother

business your career you are getting off you getting off you don't make business with God's gifts if God give you a good voice sing for his glory [Applause] so you buy those things and make make yourself listen to them music that cannot touch your soul it works on your mind well it your mind but your benefit nothing and you can listen the whole day on stuff and you open a gate to the devil and the Devil comes in you stop a little you stop at that door for a short time where he used to go remember somebody s and said the things I used to do I don't do them anymore because there is a big change in my heart but yet say the the church age book that it will come a time when the second generation comes in that desire for God goes away that Ze for the Lord and the things they never used to do they begin to do them and the things they never they they did they stopped to do today I look the weddings I see the weddings today and I see the whole world in the wedding paint sisters pain themselves sh the ey say is my day you have a day of your and you open the the gate to the no wonder we as powerful as the church cannot move the of this church ought to be a power this church ought to be an armyy defeated but what happened we open the door and Satan came in and P cold cold water and what do we have worship because we stop to think we stop time like this sister let me tell you this let me just finish yes said said well I'm I'm going to think said oh Lord you know I love you though said you know I love you Lord but I can sure remember the time when Lee and I used to win all the cups and so forth said my I remember that old music used to attract me I don't it it doesn't now you just think it don't it's already got you right there got already got you you listen it got into you that picture did something to your mind it is behind your subconscious did something to you that gosp did something to you it influences your decision you think nothing happened something happened inside okay you just think it don't it already got you right there that's just as good as he wants right there how many ever know Nelly Sanders well I guess I lot of you said she said well you know what said maybe if I walk up on the steps up there said maybe I'll be able to testify to some of them oh see you are right on the Devil's Ground stay out of it shine the very appearance of evil and I want to tell you that's what we do we want to get that pleas we'll testify to them one of the small things I knew when we were small young Christians never went to believer party tell us come you never come there sometimes we have business deals somebody tells let's me that that I never go to why that is the Devil's Ground And when you go the Devil's Ground you give the devil an advantage have the home ground always play your game with the home ground oh you think if I go into that CH that Society I tell them the word keep away that the Devil's Ground that the Devil's Ground and the mistake you do is to get there and the devil has a home ground advantage over you yes brother but but she walked up the top of the steps and stood there for a few minutes and first thing you know she was in somebody's arms out on the floor brother that's brother brother brother that's not a brother a man she was already dancing with the man she didn't mean it there she is she didn't mean there it is so then tell me you don't mean [Music] bad it is not how close you can get to see it is how far can you be away from me and the Bible says avoid every appearance of evil it is not how much you can be close to evil how you avoid glory to [Music] God yes then she come to herself then she come to herself and she was standing there crying and going on and said oh I'm lost now for good yeah I thought well I don't know how too much about the Bible but I believe Jesus said this in my name shall they cast out Devils yes and Wayne had done so up a little bit and I was sitting there watching so I said now devil I don't know who you are but I'm telling you now this is my sister and you ain't got no business with holding her she didn't mean to do that she just stopped for a minute that's where she

long rose up from behind her with long hair hanging down out of its wings and off its feet like that was goingo started right towards me just as hard as it come now stopping for a minute and I don't mean it going to see and I'm in a man's arms I you mean it got a demon into her and how many Believers today may be under the influence of demons and yet they s in the church she did something good she looked for brother and that demon was cast out you know by listening just stop to listen to that gossip and you open for the devil you know something enters you do you know watching that video

comeing never more to R open wide [Music] th I'm coming with every eye closed I want you to think about what you have had today many of these things as spirits and demons we don't even get to realize it did you know that listening to the music of the world you give an advantage to the enemy and it brings demons in [Music] you this woman near just went close CL just close to this bar and D party and she thought she would just listen for just a moment just a little bit but you know she was drawn away into the arms of this man it is just so surprising but true true that those demons entered her right there and when she came to herself she run as quick as possible the middle of the night rush to where brother bam was knock the door and the door she was a child of God but she was possessed by wrong spirits because she had given an advantage to the devil and right there you might think that brother bham would just say it's all right you are fine but he realized there are spirits there are demons that were in her and he began to cast them out and this is so real friends he said it came out of her as a big butt [Music] and as a big [Music] Shadow and when it came out of her went straight to attack brother BR and he said oh Lord God the blood of Jesus protect me from that friends this was a battle and Wayne who was sleeping in the bed jumped out of the bed and here it was like a big Shadow it circled around and went over and went down behind the bed out of the bed went Wayne Wayne ran into the next room as as it friend it was a battle the devil is roaming around trying to see who he will be able to get but he can't get you if you are in the word if you in the right ground where you belong there are certain decisions you make you need to make now maybe those bad images you've been looking at you're saying I'm just seeing I'm not doing those things but they're bringing in wrong demon in your life and you come to church so full of them that you can't even open your heart and yield yourself to the holy spirit that when the word comes just go goes over your your ears because you're not yielded to the holy spirit because you gave an advantage to the [Music] devil some of you maybe even have those wrong charts the the preacher was talking about those Tik Tok videos you are feeding on those bars you getting too saying I'm just meeting a friend that is not your [Music] ground that's not your ground before you know it you are doing what they are doing you are dressing the way they are dressing you are speaking the way they are speaking you are behaving the way they are behaving why because demons have possessed you wrong spirits God has spoken to mothers and fathers husbands and wives giving the devil an advantage friends this is the holy spirit ministering to

in this presence in this atmosphere the Lord can meet you all you need to do is to yield yourself repent of your sin With all sincerity and say Lord Jesus I'm tired of sin and strength I'm now coming home I'm going to sort this that and that but I ask you Lord here is my cup feel me when you receive the Holy Spirit then you realize it's not hard to stop the pornography it's not hard to stop the worldly music that appetite that you have to go in a dance party or whatever it is dies permanently you realize that all this desire for Tik Tok fun videos noer your affection is now on things above
