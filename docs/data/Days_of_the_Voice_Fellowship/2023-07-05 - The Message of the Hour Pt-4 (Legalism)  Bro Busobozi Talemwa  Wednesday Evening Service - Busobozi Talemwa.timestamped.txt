[33:11] but your goodness has been running after
[33:15] us
[33:16] is like a
[33:20] Rivers
[33:22] because we were a part of you from the
[33:24] very beginning
[33:27] Lord what can we say
[33:30] but we love you
[33:32] because you first loved it
[33:35] and you purchase our Salvation on
[33:37] calvaries
[33:40] no Lord you went The Last Mile
[33:45] and now Lord we will also take the last
[33:48] mile for you
[33:51] it's a relationship
[33:57] I love we can't understand
[34:00] I love the world
[34:12] tonight we have come in your presence
[34:14] yet again
[34:16] Lord we are not doing this as a
[34:19] religious Act
[34:21] [Music]
[34:23] oh yeah get in your presence
[34:26] because we want to fellowship with you
[34:29] we want to have some time with you
[34:33] oh sometime with the King
[34:36] just a king but the King of Kings
[34:44] Lord how I understand that a wife would
[34:47] want to spend their time with their
[34:49] husbands
[34:53] a friend would like to spend time with a
[34:56] friend um
[34:58] but Lord you're more than a husband
[35:02] you are more than a friend
[35:05] Lord we want to spend time with you
[35:08] today
[35:09] and I pray Lord that you will come and
[35:11] minister to us
[35:13] through the preaching of your world
[35:16] may we be encouraged
[35:21] be brought closer to thee today at the
[35:25] end of this meeting
[36:17] I mean
[36:27] I'd like us to go to the world once
[36:29] again
[36:33] if you can take your Bibles
[36:39] we're reading from a second
[36:48] I know that we
[36:51] we had was speaking on the message of
[36:54] the hour on Sunday
[37:00] and this today I want us to continue the
[37:03] same subject
[37:06] and so this will be like a part foreign
[37:15] [Music]
[37:25] and I think I feel that is a little or a
[37:28] few things that I need to continue
[37:29] addressing and I'm president
[37:33] so that we can come into the Perfection
[37:36] I wonder
[37:39] of Jesus Christ
[37:40] [Music]
[37:42] so we are reading out of second Peter we
[37:44] are reading that scripture once again or
[37:46] maybe for for our reading tonight we can
[37:48] take a different scripture together
[37:53] we will read two scriptures before we
[37:55] get seated is Galatians Chapter 2 and
[37:58] then Acts chapter 16. together is
[38:16] Galatians Chapter 2 verses 20.
[38:23] and it is reading this way
[38:30] I am crucified
[38:32] with Christ
[38:35] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[38:38] liveth in me and the life which I now
[38:41] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[38:45] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[38:48] himself for me
[38:52] gravity Christo
[38:56] yes
[39:01] [Music]
[39:10] [Music]
[39:13] I do not
[39:15] frustrate the grace of God for if
[39:18] righteousness cometh by the law
[39:21] then Christ is dead in vain
[39:24] is
[39:29] [Music]
[39:38] also also read the
[39:41] Acts of the Apostles
[39:45] to me chapter 16 is
[39:53] just about three verses
[39:57] from verses 30.
[40:05] and here in my uh Bible I have a
[40:09] subtitle the only condition of Salvation
[40:12] uh
[40:19] foreign
[40:36] [Music]
[40:47] maybe for the whole to be able to get
[40:49] the whole perspective let us begin from
[40:51] verse 25 and then we can read up to
[40:53] verse 33.
[40:55] if that's okay
[40:58] and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed
[41:00] and sang Praises unto God and prisoners
[41:03] had them
[41:04] and suddenly there was a great
[41:06] earthquake so that the foundations of
[41:08] the prison were shaken and immediately
[41:10] all the doors were opened and everyone's
[41:13] bands were loosed
[41:39] and The Keeper of the prison awaking out
[41:42] of his sleep and seeing the prison doors
[41:45] open he drew out his sword and would
[41:48] have killed himself supposing that the
[41:50] prisoners had been had been fled um
[42:04] but
[42:05] Paul cried with a loud voice saying do
[42:09] thyself no harm for we are all here
[42:18] [Music]
[42:19] then he called for for a light and
[42:23] sprung in and came trembling and fell
[42:27] down before Paul and Silas
[42:36] and brought them out and said SARS what
[42:40] must I do to be saved
[42:59] I mean and they said
[43:04] prioritizes
[43:10] come to church every Sunday
[43:13] be baptized
[43:16] repentance
[43:19] and after you finish that
[43:23] cut your hair a certain way and videos
[43:31] okay
[43:33] was that what he said
[43:35] are you following the scripture
[43:38] get back there again today
[43:41] and they said
[43:46] it's very amazing
[43:47] let's first look at again
[43:50] and so he brought them out in case you
[43:53] missed it he brought them out
[43:56] and says
[43:58] worst what must I do to be saved me away
[44:06] [Music]
[44:09] and they say
[44:14] I'm tempted to speak other things
[44:16] let me read what it says
[44:31] and thou
[44:33] shalt be saved
[44:36] and thy house
[44:39] Amina
[44:40] is that a man
[44:43] and they spoken to him
[44:45] the word of the Lord
[44:47] and to all that were in his house
[44:54] and they took them the same hour of the
[44:57] night and washed their stripes and was
[45:00] baptized
[45:07] and when he had brought them into his
[45:09] house he set meat before them and
[45:14] rejoiced believing in God with all his
[45:18] house now
[45:27] amen Amina I would like to speak to the
[45:31] Lord for just a moment
[45:33] just pray together with me
[45:35] Lord Jesus
[45:38] once again we are coming before you
[45:41] go the subject that I want to speak on
[45:45] Lord
[45:46] I pray that you will guide me
[45:49] on what I will say
[45:51] what I will speak father check my
[45:54] thoughts
[45:57] at this time I surrender all myself and
[45:59] all of me
[46:02] and I pray that you will use me now
[46:05] also my brother who is
[46:08] May this time be a time of blessing for
[46:12] each of us
[46:15] for your people have come from near and
[46:17] fast
[46:19] and their desire is to hear from you
[46:23] foreign
[46:33] once again I want I'd like to greet you
[46:35] in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:37] foreign
[47:52] so I'm happy to see Dixon he uh was able
[47:57] to make it back today from Ginger
[47:59] themselves
[48:01] Ginger and also I'm happy to see every
[48:03] one of you
[48:05] I said God bless you tell your neighbor
[48:08] God bless
[48:11] amen Amina so I'm speaking on the the
[48:16] subject is still the same brother Isaac
[48:18] it's the message of the hour but maybe
[48:20] this time you will Struck it or put in
[48:22] Brackets or whatever you want to do
[48:23] legalism
[48:24] um
[48:32] foreign
[48:38] I don't know if that is the correct or
[48:40] perfect interpretation legalism
[48:48] or let me put this to the excessive
[48:50] adherence to law or or formula over
[48:54] again
[48:57] [Music]
[49:04] and so um remember that we are our theme
[49:07] is taken out of second Peter chapter 1
[49:09] verse 12.
[49:15] Peter said where if I will not be
[49:17] negligent to put you always in
[49:19] remembrance of these things
[49:23] the things that they had earlier on
[49:26] spoken of we spoke of them he says
[49:27] though you know them and be established
[49:29] in the present truth
[49:34] so I mean we don't always preach to you
[49:37] because you don't know what I'm going to
[49:38] preach to you about
[49:41] we don't always preach because we are
[49:43] preaching new things
[49:46] you know one person may say why do we
[49:49] have to go to church each time
[49:53] why don't we just go to church once and
[49:55] that's it
[49:57] we go Friday we go Wednesday we go
[49:59] Sunday we go even other days
[50:06] really are we learning new things
[50:10] there's no new things in the Bible Bible
[50:13] the same things that you have that you
[50:16] have had are the same things you keep
[50:17] hearing um
[50:21] but you see what is done in the process
[50:27] is as you you continue here
[50:31] to get established in the present truth
[50:35] the establishing is not a work that can
[50:38] take place in a day or an even
[50:40] foreign
[51:03] is is uh he says that if faith comes by
[51:07] hearing
[51:10] is that sister praise God bless you
[51:13] you're welcome back
[51:17] and hearing the word of God
[51:20] how are you going to be established
[51:25] in Christ
[51:28] hearing repeatedly
[51:33] it establishes your faith
[51:37] in the present room what is the present
[51:40] truth
[51:41] the present truth is Jesus Christ
[51:45] the same yesterday today and foreign
[52:00] [Music]
[52:45] [Music]
[52:53] because it has been returned or restored
[52:56] back to us the people of the end times
[53:02] the Bible has never changed
[53:05] the message did not change the Bible
[53:08] actually the message is the Bible the
[53:11] Bible because you see when God sends a
[53:13] prophet he doesn't send a prophet to
[53:16] introduce something new that woman
[53:18] sends a prophet to restore the people
[53:20] back to God
[53:27] so now we've read from Galatians and I
[53:30] would like to rehearse these two
[53:31] scriptures once again and then we will
[53:33] take it on foreign
[53:59] [Music]
[54:01] and the life which I now live in the
[54:04] flesh I live by faith in the Son of God
[54:10] um
[54:10] [Music]
[54:17] [Applause]
[54:32] but it was the life of Jesus Christ
[54:37] he calls it I now live in the flesh I
[54:40] live by the faith foreign
[54:43] [Music]
[54:51] [Music]
[55:20] I want you to
[55:23] uh and I'm going a little bit slower
[55:24] because I wanted to really catch this
[55:29] if there was a remedy
[55:34] situations
[55:39] without Jesus Christ
[55:42] he did not need to die
[55:45] if there was something that could be
[55:48] done
[55:50] you could restore a man back to God
[55:54] Jesus didn't have to die yes but the
[55:58] reason why he died was because there was
[56:01] absolutely nothing
[56:04] that could be done
[56:07] mankind to restore their relationship
[56:10] back to God
[56:13] you see there are many things
[56:20] the law was right here
[56:23] because the law made them to do what God
[56:26] intended for them
[56:35] the law could not bring a perfect
[56:37] restoration of the children of God back
[56:40] to God
[56:46] had a temporal kind of effect
[56:52] the Lord did not perfect to do the job
[56:56] and so I can say that the law was a
[56:59] shadow
[57:01] of something else that would come
[57:06] and bring the real things
[57:09] that can be able to restore the broken
[57:12] relationship
[57:14] are you hearing me and that and the law
[57:18] that was a shadow of Grace
[57:22] let me tell you grace
[57:25] everything the law was saying
[57:30] but what was the law telling the
[57:32] children of Israel
[57:51] Jesus Christ came yes Christian when he
[57:55] came he died on the cross
[57:57] and when he died on the cross then Paul
[58:00] says
[58:01] hallelujah he said I'm crucified with
[58:05] Christ
[58:07] and nevertheless I live
[58:10] yet not I since Christ leave us in me
[58:16] and that life
[58:19] amen he says that the life which I now
[58:23] live
[58:25] in the flesh I live by the faith of the
[58:30] son of God
[58:33] foreign
[58:43] [Applause]
[59:21] so what do we need to do
[59:24] in order
[59:26] to be safe
[59:28] Acts chapter 16.
[59:31] we've had the story everyone of how this
[59:35] man is

[59:47] the story you've already read it out for
[59:49] you
[59:52] foreign
[1:01:22] what must I do
[1:01:27] and and this man
[1:01:32] and so they answered him
[1:01:35] let us read it again together
[1:01:41] on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:45] let us read it I can tell your neighbor
[1:01:48] and they said
[1:01:52] on the Lord
[1:01:54] Jesus yes Christo
[1:01:58] I mean and you will be saved
[1:02:01] your house

[1:02:18] that what is preached in
[1:02:21] most of Christendom um

[1:02:37] on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:41] believe
[1:02:43] you want me to say more um
[1:02:51] yes Crystal now let me surprise you we
[1:02:55] have a lot of people
[1:02:57] that are in churches
[1:02:59] but don't actually believe
[1:03:05] no they they're doing the religious
[1:03:07] things
[1:03:08] the Catholics they follow the laws of
[1:03:12] Catholicism
[1:03:18] they are doing everything their religion
[1:03:20] tells them
[1:03:25] as long as they tell them will you shout
[1:03:27] or you speak in tongues they do it and
[1:03:28] they are fine they're safe
[1:03:32] and even in our message
[1:03:35] we have what we can also say if you do
[1:03:38] this on this and if you did all this
[1:03:40] then you you were bright you are going
[1:03:42] to The Rapture
[1:03:46] you know so every religion every
[1:03:51] you know religion even those who are not
[1:03:53] Christians they have their own set of
[1:03:56] rules
[1:03:58] but if you did this
[1:04:02] you are going to heaven
[1:04:05] foreign
[1:04:44] Jesus looked at him he said he was you
[1:04:48] speak well you've done all you're not
[1:04:51] requested but in other words
[1:04:54] you yourself no now what you might still
[1:04:57] avoid in your heart
[1:05:00] because otherwise he couldn't have come
[1:05:03] to Jesus Christ
[1:05:08] he realized
[1:05:12] salvation Christ was not in the Deeds of
[1:05:16] the law Christopher
[1:05:19] but here he was
[1:05:22] hallelujah amen disciples asked a
[1:05:25] question
[1:05:26] this man the prison guard he asked a
[1:05:29] question
[1:05:29] [Applause]
[1:05:30] to the disciples
[1:05:32] what must I do to be saved
[1:05:36] and they said believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ
[1:05:44] foreign
[1:05:58] foreign
[1:06:25] so here Katie Jesus looks at him he says
[1:06:30] you don't need me when to tell you the
[1:06:32] law they wait against
[1:06:37] but there is
[1:06:42] here he didn't quote anything
[1:06:46] he Jesus yes you spoke to him he said go
[1:06:50] now
[1:06:51] sell everything you have to understand
[1:06:53] give the money to the poor Sinners
[1:06:57] you couldn't find that anywhere
[1:07:02] foreign
[1:07:14] am I communicating to some of you
[1:07:17] what Jesus spoke to this man yes
[1:07:20] he could not find it nowhere
[1:07:23] what was it it was Jesus Christ
[1:07:32] it's the same thing
[1:07:34] as this man was told
[1:07:41] the thing was not what Jesus was saying
[1:07:45] the thing was because Jesus said
[1:07:49] yes
[1:07:58] the man would have been saved the Bible
[1:08:01] says the man who went away
[1:08:04] because he had a great possessions now
[1:08:07] listen to me when you come to Jesus
[1:08:10] Christ
[1:08:11] the only thing you need to do
[1:08:14] foreign
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:09:10] get salvation because of what you did
[1:09:15] amen what you do should come out of the
[1:09:19] abundance of your faith in him
[1:09:24] [Applause]
[1:09:25] praise the name of the Lord
[1:09:29] it is so sad that the Church of Jesus
[1:09:33] Christ
[1:09:34] even after the death of Jesus Christ yes
[1:09:38] we can actually we should actually cons
[1:09:41] we should we can actually attain eternal
[1:09:44] life
[1:09:48] by our Deeds
[1:09:52] this is from Gabriel's instruction today
[1:09:54] it says Hear Me That saith the Lord
[1:09:59] God will not deal with his church
[1:10:04] till she comes back to the Homeland
[1:10:07] the message
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:12] describes as the message
[1:10:15] he says
[1:10:56] [Music]
[1:11:11] because you are a member of a certain
[1:11:14] Church
[1:11:17] I'm not going to the Rapture because
[1:11:19] you're a member of dvf okay
[1:11:22] no none of us is going to make it that
[1:11:25] way
[1:11:26] you are going to The Rapture only on one
[1:11:29] bus okay
[1:11:31] genuinely believed on the Lord Jesus
[1:11:34] Christ
[1:11:36] the message
[1:11:38] has come to call us out
[1:11:42] on his system
[1:11:47] organizations
[1:12:01] it is the word of God
[1:12:05] that is the message
[1:12:09] that has always been the message of
[1:12:11] energy
[1:12:17] community
[1:12:33] [Applause]
[1:13:05] maybe another day I'll talk about a
[1:13:07] Calvinism but tonight I'm talking about
[1:13:09] armenianism and I would like us to
[1:13:11] concentrate on that yeah
[1:13:17] which is legalism
[1:13:24] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:43] foreign
[1:13:44] so let us begin with one here from the
[1:13:47] message Jehovah Jireh and the prophet
[1:13:49] says what we need today is back to the
[1:13:51] real message
[1:13:56] because he calls the real message
[1:14:04] God said salvation
[1:14:12] yeah he calls it there he calls it the
[1:14:15] old time
[1:14:17] the real plane
[1:14:23] God sends salvation of Pentecost
[1:14:28] he says
[1:14:32] now some of you when you hear the
[1:14:34] message
[1:14:35] the reason why I'm talking the subjects
[1:14:38] many people have misunderstood
[1:14:41] what this message is
[1:14:44] many of you thought that the message is
[1:14:46] maybe a new church a new religion a new
[1:14:48] idea a new whatever
[1:14:53] time I'm done with this subject we all
[1:14:55] understand what the message is
[1:14:58] why we are not going to attend the
[1:15:00] church in the Catholic Church while we
[1:15:02] are here
[1:15:04] so we need to understand those things
[1:15:10] you see then he says now we find out
[1:15:13] that this dispensation
[1:15:16] then it lasted on that legalistic
[1:15:19] dispensation
[1:15:23] [Music]
[1:15:27] the real Royal seed come
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:30] um
[1:15:32] then he taken all the legalism upon
[1:15:35] himself
[1:15:38] and he paid the price of redemption
[1:15:42] and God is church is bad
[1:16:37] we don't do that
[1:17:10] to be safe
[1:17:13] and Paul told him believe on the Lord
[1:17:17] Jesus Christ
[1:17:20] is this your Prophet saying these words
[1:17:24] if he's your Prophet if it's our Prophet
[1:17:26] Say Amen
[1:17:29] [Music]
[1:17:30] and brother says
[1:17:32] when a sinner comes to the Lord
[1:17:35] he's not talking about a Believer who
[1:17:37] has been a Believer for a while
[1:17:44] some people
[1:17:46] actually thought that the message was
[1:17:48] hard
[1:17:53] the message
[1:18:03] what if that we frustrated the seed of
[1:18:06] God
[1:18:08] but he said when a sinner comes to the
[1:18:11] Lord
[1:18:13] we don't treat them like Paul did when
[1:18:16] the Philippian Jailer said what must I
[1:18:18] do to be said
[1:18:28] Paul said to him foreign
[1:19:31] she already knows that information
[1:19:52] in other words we need to preach Faith
[1:19:57] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:00] he says not come join our congregation
[1:20:03] again
[1:20:08] come stand up before the church
[1:20:23] that wasn't it
[1:20:27] Jehovah
[1:21:32] and this is a very nice story
[1:21:35] and he calls it he says the Bible is a
[1:21:39] Love Letter Bible
[1:22:41] we absolutely and we believe in the
[1:22:44] grace we believe in life
[1:22:47] are you are you is that not right
[1:22:52] from the moment I met her
[1:22:55] has always been loved
[1:22:57] I think if I was not married I would not
[1:23:00] have preached this because
[1:23:11] Hallelujah I mean praise the name of the
[1:23:13] Lord and he says when I get ready to go
[1:23:17] overseas
[1:23:19] everything I'm reading here I'm quoting
[1:23:21] but I'm actually talking about myself
[1:23:26] when I get ready to go overseas
[1:23:29] I don't reach over here and get her see
[1:23:33] my dear Mrs
[1:23:36] Thou shalt not have any more husbands
[1:23:40] Thou shalt not make I
[1:24:04] we do not do it
[1:25:06] foreign
[1:25:10] that's the way we that's the way the
[1:25:13] Christians that's the way we have tried
[1:25:15] to make sure
[1:25:16] yeah
[1:25:19] it's in our minds even you yourself
[1:25:25] with Jesus like that
[1:25:28] until it does not yield any fruit
[1:25:33] because you always think oh he's a big
[1:25:36] God somewhere and he's waiting for you
[1:25:38] to do a mystery he will stick because
[1:25:47] his wife
[1:25:49] waiting for him to not answer your
[1:25:51] questions
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:58] their prayers are not answered
[1:26:03] from today
[1:26:07] hey
[1:26:12] church is not supposed to be that way
[1:26:14] it's supposed to be a love affairs
[1:26:20] between you and Jesus
[1:26:23] hallelujah amen
[1:26:31] oh praise God make your own salvation
[1:26:40] oh my God he says then we kneel down
[1:26:44] we pray and that's what I always do with
[1:26:47] my wife when I'm going to leave
[1:26:52] listen I have never gone for any trip
[1:26:56] asking my wife to pray for me
[1:26:59] and I did not know that even brother did
[1:27:01] it
[1:27:03] and then she asked God to help me
[1:27:06] she stays home take care of the babies
[1:27:10] and I go to work for the Lord I haven't
[1:27:14] been home but just a little bit in 15
[1:27:16] years
[1:27:21] he says in 15 years he's been home in
[1:27:24] just a little bit
[1:27:27] and that's how it has been with me the
[1:27:29] last 10 years of my marriage

[1:28:59] foreign
[1:29:01] let me tell you that's not how you treat
[1:29:03] a woman
[1:29:05] and even God doesn't treat his woman
[1:29:07] like that
[1:29:09] he's a woman
[1:29:11] we are his wife he treats us with love
[1:29:15] confidence

[1:29:47] reason

[1:36:08] is a priest
[1:36:12] that can be touched by the feelings of
[1:36:15] their information today
[1:36:25] I don't know how they call it in the
[1:36:26] Catholics
[1:36:29] who knows it

[1:36:38] penitence okay my son what have you done

[1:37:12] Justice
[1:37:14] I
[1:37:22] understand there are times and
[1:37:24] situations
[1:37:39] but I understand is only Jesus Christ
[1:37:47] can wash away my
[1:38:48] foreign foreign
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:31] hallelujah hallelujah foreign
[1:40:18] interview

[1:40:29] understand
[1:40:30] some people by the way when you are
[1:40:32] praying I don't understand
[1:40:35] because you are the brother and say oh
[1:40:38] Jesus you
[1:40:41] ought to say oh Jesus
[1:40:43] can you have your own relationship with
[1:40:46] Jesus
[1:40:48] whereby a woman would write a husband
[1:40:51] and a woman would the man would read
[1:40:52] between the lines
[1:41:01] easy for Jesus to figure you out yes
[1:41:05] oh this one this one is in this morning
[1:41:12] that's why he says
[1:41:16] he knows
[1:41:18] how do you even provide it because he
[1:41:22] understands it
[1:41:23] data but some of you who don't have a
[1:41:25] relationship with you
[1:41:26] just meet a girl or a boy out there
[1:41:29] you are new to one another
[1:41:32] no relationships
[1:41:35] but if you've been together for a while
[1:41:39] you know I just need to if my wife wrote
[1:41:42] me a text
[1:41:44] I will read it
[1:41:46] you wouldn't understand the thing
[1:41:50] but I will understand
[1:41:54] because I've been without foreign
[1:42:00] [Music]

[1:42:13] that's the way you know this love book
[1:42:15] of God of God again
[1:42:20] it is so complicated to people
[1:42:25] because you are not in love with Christ
[1:42:29] you say it contradicts itself
[1:42:44] foreign
[1:43:41] [Music]
[1:43:54] foreign
[1:44:48] that's not it
[1:44:50] that's not the basis of Fellowship
[1:45:00] is not what you do that matters
[1:45:15] because they don't understand the
[1:45:17] concept
[1:45:18] God wants to have a relationship
[1:45:23] with his children
[1:45:26] let all our works
[1:45:30] out of the abundance
[1:45:36] sometimes I've walked at home
[1:45:38] and my wife gave me a glass of juice
[1:45:43] other times
[1:45:48] cartoon
[1:46:26] [Music]
[1:47:05] they want to rely on other people's
[1:47:08] experience with their God
[1:47:14] it doesn't work
[1:47:27] here in first thess 5 19 it says quench
[1:47:31] not the spirit
[1:47:37] people here it's not our works that
[1:47:39] count before God
[1:47:43] when people hear that they
[1:47:47] develop the attitude that we can do
[1:47:49] whatever we want to do is
[1:47:55] listen to what he says here in the
[1:47:57] message thy loving kindness
[1:48:03] away from God
[1:48:06] see that friend away from God
[1:48:08] um she
[1:48:11] is
[1:48:12] seeing a friend he's talking to seeing a
[1:48:14] friend away from God that is away from
[1:48:16] God
[1:48:20] little woman
[1:48:23] you realize that you are trying to
[1:48:25] quench that fast that God give to you to
[1:48:28] thrust after him
[1:48:33] and you're quenching it with the devil's
[1:48:36] Pleasures
[1:48:39] Moses forsook Egypt to be
[1:48:42] foreign
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:16] of course the bad ones make it clear
[1:49:18] together
