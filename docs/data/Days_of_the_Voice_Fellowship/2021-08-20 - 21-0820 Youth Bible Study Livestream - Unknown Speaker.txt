lord is good all the time and all the time amen amen now this day we by the grace of god i'm going to start on the paga men church age i want to welcome you all in the precious name of our lord jesus um i thought the girls were not going to show up so i thought you gave up the bible study you know because we understand that if anyone will miss twice they'll not be allowed admittedly again i hope you got the information okay so you should be very very serious and then the next time if trainable doesn't read they will also not be admitted so how may i finish the pokemon church age raise up your hand okay sister doctors which play are you on you're about to finish it so if anyone is below sister doctors it means you you are not serious taking this serious you should really be very serious with reading so that when we come you can be able to ask questions which will lead you to understand and for uh be able to discuss with us and give us some good nuggets which can be a blessing praise so um who has something substantial that you'd like to share with us as we start our program today from the programming church age well can i go one by one but i realize if i go one by one sometimes we we take three services three days to finish a church a chapter so uh but idealize also when i ask you to volunteer yourself and this and discuss with us what you have read no one does or if you do so i don't know which strategy we are going to use to involve everybody vertical yes have you finished the chat if affirmative you're about to finish it yes what is it that your already shocked you more almost from the figurement age you see what does it say 81. the prophet said here there was there was an original church and the future was good but uh it talked about nimrod and actually and of because when we see what they did what is it where did the lineage of harm come from okay yes uh my main emphasis is going to be emerald nimrod i think it was actually we had three targets in his life nimrod's first target was to make himself known and popular and a mighty mind his second target was to was to make his own religion and the third target was to to build a great city and when you look at numerous targets they are not really good because when we look at making himself popular the way he was going to make himself popular was really not it was not the right way because how would make himself popular was quick by creating a religion uh this is where the trinity came in he had a prophet say that trinity it's the first thing which came into the church to to spoil it and do everything it started with trinity anyway it says that polytheistic religion of the enemy began with a humanitarian doctrine where we all know trinity we believe in three goods some people believe that one good one good but in three minds something like that it explains somewhere about what people think about trinity but this interim doctrine is really not right actually i believe nicknamed uh foreign whereby it is not you because there is only one god i believe we all know trinity that's why for sure the prophet emphasizes and god has got it with it because even up to today actually i read some might say that it says that let me look for that line but it says that uh that people will they will keep on being lied to until jesus comes about you i didn't think of three goods until jesus comes back that's why for when i first read i was wondering i said for sure i was saying for sure that these things of long trility was overwhelming but here it really showed you that it will be there until you just come back yes so that's that's my mind and also about uh the trinity uh the trinity which the first trinity it was about i think nimrod's wife and the sun when nimrod died that's how they in it to be and so they would worship the mother and the son that is that is that is wife and i think maybe that child but the most surprising thing here the sun here is also your husband or your mother yeah and it explains so much and very many things about things is a very wrong doctrine and it didn't just start to recent it started sometime back actually when the two jews when they took the message to rome they were just away they were sent away and a few remains there were not strong in faith and they continued without talking and up to now we still see it around only right now they call mary as a queen other than which was nemo's wife in the past tense this whole neighborhood she was called she had a very hard name and then what she might so inside is to call the queen of heaven and now they all marry the queen of heaven do you see any religion today that has the resemblance of what the brother is talking about so what does it tell you yeah actually that's emphasized many times he says people die but spirits don't die so that's why when whenever you want to compare what you're seeing today or what you are doing yourself if you don't find it in the scripture then you need to you need to find out where it is who do you compare with if you are so angry you become you angered quickly who do you compare with if you are a liar you speak life you tell rice who do you compare with if you cheat and steal who do you compare with me if you paint yourself who do you compare with and remember the jackal that jacob was meant to go to hell it is israel who is the priest with god amen so if you compare with the old jacob and you're cheating a liar you know where you're going who do you compare with when you listen to the worldly music who do you compare with everything you do today there is someone actually preaching to someone and they call it identification that's right and then it says we are identified with christ but whatever people die but spirits don't die so the things you do only identify you with whoever had it before that's right so you need to check up the things that you follow and the people you make your own models all right can we now have the screen on we are going to share the uh the reading we just go straight over to the reading as we did last time and we really will be listening to a few questions here and there and fast forwarding it to whatever we i feel that there will be a point if there is somebody with a question stop stop me and us so that we can be able to listen but if you do not stop me then i think you don't have a question i'll question you and if you can't answer it then you're going to be in trouble praise a lot amen i hope that everybody will be following this up following very well all right now i would like us to start listening in why following in our books chapter five the pergament church age revelation are we still ancient looks like we already went and to the angel of the church in pergamus right these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is yes sister the sisters were online if you can hear when i play let us know whether you can hear sure we need to reconnect this no we need to be connected now hold this fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days okay let me try to [Music] foreign antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth but i have a few things against thee because thou has there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things you just have to give us a moment okay you can hear where over there but we can't hear so we need to we need to get it fixed first okay let's do it again hmm can you sing the chorus as you try to sergey it's coming so brother what the hell did yourself get some problems yeah usually there are very many beauties guess a problem yeah for some reason whether it is connected now it just disconnected if it is not blinking it means it is connected if it is disconnected it keeps the water white blue but even now that's just connected it may get difficult playing this so you have to put something yeah maybe it is not connected to you okay can that doesn't have a good voice you try that okay so we use that okay those were online forgive us we have uh had a small technical bridge here who disconnected unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate repent or else i will come unto thee and to the angel of the church in pergamus right these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days we're in antipas okay those who are online can you hear me uh can you hear the reading sister sarah is it clear can you hear but imagine right now quest is off but then i want to know that you are here okay so all of you have your books you can follow along with my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth but i have a few things against thee because thou hast dare them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it pergamos pergamum ancient name was situated in missia in a district watered by three rivers by one of which it communicated to the sea it was described as the most illustrious city in asia it was a city of culture with the library second only to that in alexandria yet it was a city of great sin given over to licentious rites of worship of escuelapius whom they worshipped in the form of a living serpent which was housed and fed in the temple in this beautiful city of irrigated groves public walks and parks lived a small group of dedicated believers who were not fooled by the veneer of beauty and abhorred the satanic worship that filled the place the age the pergamian age lasted about 300 years from 312 to 606 a.d the messenger using our god-given rule for choosing the messenger to each age that is we choose the one whose ministry most closely approximates that of the first messenger paul we unhesitatingly declare the pergamian messenger to be martin martin was born in 315 in hungary however his life work was in france where he labored in and around tour as a bishop he died in 399. this great saint was the uncle of another wonderful christian saint patrick of ireland martin was converted to christ while he was following a career as a professional soldier it was while he was still engaged in this occupation that a most remarkable miracle occurred it is recorded that a beggar lay sick in the streets of the town where martin was posted the winter cold was more than he could bear for he was poorly clad no one paid any attention to his needs until martin came by seeing this poor man's plight but not having an extra garment he took off his outer cloak cut it in two with his sword and wrapped the cloth around the freezing man he attended him the best he could and went on his way that night the lord jesus appeared unto him in a vision there he stood like a beggar wrapped in a half of martin's garment he spoke to him and said martin though he is only a catechumen has clothed me with this garment from that time on martin sought to serve the lord with all his heart his life became a series of miracles manifesting the power of god after having left the army and having become a leader in the church hey that way did you get that or you missed it what did you get there someone wants to talk about it and then there was silence and you all said you got it yes my brand surely for me i have just read it when we were starting i just loved it so much i've realized one thing that this man had character he had a good character because it is not godu told him to take care of that big yes it was it was his character he was a good man because usually there was a brother was saying you know our works our works god knew eyes he chooses but when you look at this what this man did you can't say that he was led you can't say it was good because it was jesus but i think he had a very good character yes and there is a question which very many people ask themselves why did god say that david had a heart like that of god even david had that heart if you could die for for a sheep to fight with her and so even this man when god i think so that character that good heart it really so that's one thing this is very powerful why do you think brother do you know sister doctors do you even know the person that the brother is talking about who is he talking about which baby is yes he took he took i wanted to imagine oh yeah you are a christian by the way do you know what religion means to be religious do you know what to be religious means who knows it what does it mean people we're in a bible study these are certain things we must get answers for all right yes so i'd like you to pick up your bible first put up down your church edge book pick up your bible and i want to get you to read jim's chapter one verses 26 brother can you give it to me up here on the screen james chapter 1 verses 26 and 27 okay you need to open a bit faster if your bible is your friend by now you should be you should have reached but if your bible sees you once in a long while and misses you very much i'm sure it is still it should even have some papers which are stuck together it is still as new as you received it but if it is your friend by now it should be there james chapter 1 verse 26 what does it say everybody one two three go if any man among you seem to be religious and breedeth not his time but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this too visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world praise the name of the lord hallelujah now i uh okay for some reason what you've shared has not come up here i don't know why maybe then it looks a bit slow okay but i'll share with you uh the uh the this version here i just love it because it kind of brings it up very very well also it says you can you can put it up on the screen for them to see yeah in gems one verse 26 this is i'm reading from the uh kjv but i can call it the amplified version it says if anyone thinks himself to be religious scrupulously observant of the rituals of his faith huh if you are saying you are a good believer you are you know very religious you are a good man a spiritual huh yes and does not control his tongue but deludes his own art if you don't control your time yeah you delude your own heart your religion is worthless it's futile it's barren you see yes then that's a for another day but look at verse 27 pure and and unblemished religion as it is expressed in outward acts you are and what an unblemished religion as it is expressed in outward actions you know what james i what i love about gems james always said show me your faith by without your works and i will show you my faith by my what so here he is saying pure and any blemish religion as it is expressed in our outward word acts in the sight of our god and the father is this to visit and look after the fatherless to visit and if you know of some people who don't have a father they are called one orphans how many he has ever missed a day of being kind to sometimes you people you have fathers and mothers and you forget there are people who don't have any and there are people here who claim to be christians and they don't even visit or even they know some of them some of you were like couldn't be there even orphans some of you i've never even thought about it you see those who visit the fatherless and also those who look after them those who visit them and those who do what look after them you see that's why it is good for you as a christian always to extend the love of god that is in your heart to someone else especially the fatherless and the widows and the world in their distress so their injury stress they are in problems do something today for them okay i hope you give that to the lord and to keep oneself and contaminated by the secular world so you find someone in distress would you help them you find you believers contaminating themselves with the world out there how do you coordinate yourself how do you contemplate yourself like what okay that's the extreme now going to buzz i really if you're a believer you go to about you you need to even be excommunicated if you're a believer and you go to those dance parties there's a big problem with you you're not even a believer yet i think because i believe it's always been converted yes those parties those you know yeah we talked about your top last time you know watching their movies huh watching the world those were the movies which have casting which have you know things that don't really glorify the name of the lord which has sex which has things like that you find the believers watching things like that that shouldn't be watched by believers you find them listen to the music of the world they are contaminating themselves by the things of the world you know you are listening then before we know if you're also doing the same thing because you are you are feeding on it so don't drop bruce you're contaminating you've got to contaminate yourself you're very valuable tell your neighbor you're very valuable you're very very so these are things of the world these secular things of the world please avoid politics britain brethren each and every one of you i'm encouraging you to stay away from me stay clear from me amen if you do want to take a vote me myself i don't vote i've not got it in my life but it is not a sin to vote so if at any time the time of voting has come and you want to vote your leader go if you prayed over that god is ready to force somebody go and vote okay because voting is exactly what see go and vote after voting go back don't talk about politics please leave those things alone it is not good for you to contaminate yourself for those things leave it alone why am i feeling like i'm hitting a rock leave it alone amen god bless you brother leave those things alone those things don't contaminate yourself then the other thing is uh um helping those who are in distress the widows the fatherless it doesn't have to be only those but anybody who is in need so you find here the bible is not talking about our brother who martin brother might be something that brother has said that he's really that has really attached to me he said that this man was not a you know told by god to go and do this but this was out of his heart you know you cannot help somebody out of your heart and want others to see what you're doing someone asked a question the other day is it right for believers to give in public to me i don't think that is what the bible tells us you know says how men are going to help brother brother so and so for in his problem no one will show up when we tell them come and see the pastor even when you tell them send offerings on phones especially these businesses that we are now online send offerings on the phone people will not send offerings on phone but when they are giving when everybody is seeing for example on funerals on weddings when they are putting them on their whatsapp listen there on things like that everybody's rushing so that their name can be with the biggest number he will look through this was giving 100. this one has a given 200. so he's giving me twenty thousand this one has given 10 million [Music] remember that thing that's the very very speed that is making people do that you as a believer you must not give to be saved by others amen you must not give to be sin by what you must always give because you have a heart of giving you must always do something for someone because you really feel in your heart you want to know but how can you feel that you want to do it really if you do not have character what is character speaking about character character comes only by the things you have suffered the things you have gone through the things you have experienced brother you know you're going through some things in your life and you really don't want someone else to go through them some oh god help me i'm feeling annoyed where i talk about me sometimes people they want to help someone or they think that when only those who have so much they should be the ones to help or they think that because you you you when someone has helped them they think oh they have too much they have plenty they're rich yeah especially in uganda you know that spirit is so strong i've not seen it in some other countries in uganda it is very strong you know when you when someone has helped you you think this person is so rich it means i can even give much more you know and even some people don't give because you think they are not rich that's a bad spirit let me tell you you know when you are going to give yourself because you have too much yes giving is a a character like the mother said a character it's character that you have learned it's a it's something which is in your heart that you really want to do for somebody for for their livelihood for their for their you know someone registered for the brother you know you want to do something for someone because in your heart you oppressed you are led you are you understand it's something you feel and when you do it oh you feel so nice and happy and you don't want anyone to know that you did it let me tell you if you ever do something and you feel you want people to know how to appreciate you then you never did give you never did do that these days before giving cameras even you know they go and head up all the orphans and everywhere they they collect people with camera they go they give while they are you know taking video and showing on tv and pictures and let me tell you when you are giving you don't need to go in the lineup to be seen yes do what you are doing because it is your character it is a part of it is your life amen right now we have like that as we are beginning the pagan church age martin who was the messenger of this church age he found a beggar a beggar how many find a beggar and they dismissed them this man found a beggar laying sick he was a beggar and he was sick on the streets of the town and when martin saw him oh his heart went up to this man he was cold you know the man was dressed badly you know no one paid any attention to his needs and you know it doesn't mean that there were no people or christians passing by they were christians but martin saw this man he was like oh he was touched immediately because he was a christian he he also had a character he also had the love of god in himself there's someone who sang a song said you know nothing until you know the love of god you know i don't know if you have ever heard of that song so the man did not have what to give sure he said what can i do maybe you didn't even have mine to go buy another cloth what did he do he decided to cut a piece of what he had he knew he needed it also but he knew that man also needed some so he said we shall share what we have we shall do what share what let me tell you we as christians do not give because we have too much we don't give because we have sometimes myself personally have given until i never remain with anything at times that we will put my family at risk because i do not know what we will use at home but i give as far as i am led to it not as far as much as i have but as much as i am late and with whatever i have i can share that with somebody else and martin noticed martin you know this must be cut off a piece of his cloth and he covered this man who was freezing he attended him the best he could and went his way he didn't even say what is your number so i can look you up or you know give me a whatsapp number so can be friends he wasn't helping this man because of what he was going to get out of it all the glory that oh even this man i don't even think this man had the strength to tell him thank you he helped him because of the love which was in his heart that made the lord just jesus passed unto him in a vision after he had that man jesus came to him in a vision at night there he stood like a beggar wrapped in a half of martinez garment now some of you are beginning to understand what had happened he spoke to him and said martin though he is only a a cartilage man has closed me with his garment hallelujah imagine this man was able hallelujah to understand that who the person he held was not actually marty it was actually our lord jesus oh what you have done and to the list of the saints you have done it unto me whatever little obvious you do for a child of god you have done it for the lord amen this man wasn't even in the church he wasn't even a believer by the way there would have been people who would have judged martin but now could you do that brother martin this is not even a believer who knows who how do you even know how did he even become sick maybe god delivered him because of his sins maybe god cast him how can how dare you take the resources which would have even helped others and you are you know you're but actually that was the lord jesus who was in that call it was the lord jesus who needed help it was the lord jesus christ who needed to a cloth we needed something and that's why the bible says there's more blessing to again i if each of us is here in this place and those of you who are online those seven connections i cannot look at you right now to know who is there but whoever is connected to this meeting to death really on this portion that we have read just this portion if all of us can make a commitment to the lord and to ourselves not to be receivers only but to be givers to be givers more of givers than receivers if we can each of us make that commitment i tell you oh we are going to be that glorious church without support without ego even you brother you have something to give look at this brother billy now say now what can i give myself brother you have too much that you can give you have a love that you can give there is much that you can give amen you if even if you don't have money you can give what you have you remember those brothers was it peter and john didn't join us they fought that man begging the man he's like this must before this one and you know the did not have money that's right but i told him silver and gold we don't have but what we have you see yes we give unto you what do they have what did they have you remember the two things that must be the true church that's right yeah sister what are those three things that must be in the true church number one the true word of god the true word of god number two number two the manifestation of the power of god amen amen through the gifts and other things these people had the power of god that manifestation of the power of god they said silva and god we have none but one year we give unto you right and a but what they had could make this man rich do you know what you have can make people rich without actually giving them money if people can receive your jesus this jesus is more than just words he is power hallelujah power that can put people to having ideas that's an idea of business hallelujah having that idea of getting an idea what i was thinking talking about that i remember you brother you now have an idea of business and let me tell you if you stick with it without getting faith and i'm saying this online because i know it is recorded and you will hear it if you faint not that business is going to prosper and you are going to be a very rich businessman that's what is going to happen because when you receive these business ideas it's not coming from the devil it's coming from god because god wants us to be given more than receivers and god doesn't want us to be poor and mediocres and vegans you understand so what am i saying you are the hands of god be a giver be a giver if all of us can be given more than receivers there is going to be a revival amen hallelujah amen all right shall we now continue he took a very militant stand against idolatry he cut down the groves broke up the images and pulled down the altars when confronted by the pagans for his deeds he challenged them in much the same manner that elijah did the prophets of baal he offered to be tied to a tree on its underside so that when it was cut down it would crush him unless god intervened and turned the tree around while it fell the wiley heathen tied him to a tree that was growing on the side of a hill assured that the natural pull of gravity would cause the tree to so fall as to crush him just as the tree began to fall god swung it around and uphill contrary to all natural laws the fleeing heathen were crushed as the tree fell on several of them you people huh you didn't hear this please okay but that is mine okay all right now i i i want you i want you to listen to this again after having left the army and having become a leader in the church he took a very militant stand against idolatry he cut down the groves broke up the images and pulled down the altars when confronted by the pagans for his deeds he challenged them in much the same manner that elijah did the prophets of baal he offered to be tied to a tree on its underside so that when it was cut down it would crush him unless god intervened and turned the tree around while it fell the wily heathen tied him to a tree that was growing on the side of a hill assured that the natural pull of gravity would cause the tree to so fall as to crush him just as the tree began to fall god swung it around and uphill contrary to all natural laws the fleeing heathen were crushed as the tree fell on several of them hallelujah hallelujah yes sir they were trying to tell him that god is serving he's not a true god the god i'm serving is not a true god okay do your rest ah you don't even like martin and tell the devil to do his worse okay we'll try you on a tree upside down the other side whereby when we cut it you everyone can see you know by logic by the reality and everything that usually the tree is going to fall on you and keep you because this is we are we are trying to get this side down and why for us we are up here on the hill [Music] friends yes god swung that the tree around uphill contrary to all natural laws amen when god is in your life when you receive this living god he is able to change everything and anything in your life against all natural rules hallelujah why because he is the creator of all this love amen hallelujah if they say that you have to first get to 30 or 40 to prosper god can make you prosper at 15. yes yes if they say you have to first do this to have this god can do the opposite yes verify there is not that our god cannot turn around historians acknowledge that on at least three occasions he raised the dead by faith in jesus name in one instance he prayed for a dead baby like elisha he stretched himself upon the babe and prayed it came back to life and health on another occasion he was called to help deliver a brother who was being carried away to his death in a time of great persecution by the time he arrived the poor man was already dead they had hanged him upon a tree his body was lifeless and his eyes protruded from the sockets but martin took him down and when he had prayed the man was restored to life and to his rejoicing family martin never did fear the enemy regardless of who it was thus he went to personally face a wicked emperor who was responsible for the death of many spirit-filled saints the emperor would not grant an audience so martin went to see a friend of the emperor juan damasus a cruel bishop of rome but the bishop being a nominal christian of the false vine would not intercede martin went back to the palace but by now the gates had been locked and they would not allow him to enter he laid down on his face before the lord and prayed that he be able to get into the palace he heard a voice bidding him arise when he did so he saw the gates open of their own accord he walked into the court but the arrogant ruler would not turn his head and speak to him when they got the cross gets on you god will open them that's why they say that you know i've given you an open door that a man won't be able to cross when god opens a door for you my brother if it was time for god to open a door for you you won't struggle all you need to do is to ask talk and if you're proposing rejected by the workers all the time because the door is the right time for you to open for that particular door god will open it for you without you having to struggle you know my brother and my sister do not struggle with the things of this life amen which is the god who opens doors and just go to classes there are ways to be open suddenly a fire came spontaneously from the seat of the throne and the unhappy emperor vacated speedily surely the lord humbles the crowd and exalts the lowly he goes to the bishop who had knocked himself open amen praise the name of the lord brother can you now hear me here clear are we now clear okay so don't open the doors don't open the doors and after the doors i don't know why but the brother said they cannot hear the rest can you hear us oh okay we just want to make sure that our sound is fine okay how is it now is that better okay okay um [Music] okay let us know is that better is that better it is sorted okay hello brother shalom are you okay the sound is wrong but it is better okay that's fine isn't it okay so i think we'll go with that and in a minute i'm going to excuse myself brother we will help us continue but then i'll be back anyways let us hear that part such was his order and serving the lord that the devil was mightily aroused and i was just uh commenting on how the devil wanted to have him finished and not enter in but he they never couldn't stop him they never cannot stop you where god has sent you yes and when the man when he reached there the man decided to turn his head and when he turned his head god put a fire on his seat god put a fire on his seat and he had to turn by force hallelujah you know if god wants you to meet people even if they don't want to meet you god will put a fire on them to meet you amen that's the god we serve therefore we believe in a god that can do all things we believe in a god who makes all things possible such was his order in serving the lord that the devil was mightily aroused the enemies of truth hired assassins to kill martin they came by stealth to his home and as they were about to kill him he stood erect and bared his throat to the sword as they leaped forward the power of god suddenly hurled them back across the room so overcome were they in that holy and fearful atmosphere that they crawled upon their hands and knees and begged forgiveness for the attempt upon his life too often when men are signally used of the lord they become lifted up with pride but not so with martin he ever remained the humble servant of god one night as he was preparing himself to enter the pulpit a beggar came to his study and asked for some clothing martin referred the beggar to his head deacon the haughty deacon commanded him to leave thereupon he went back to see martin martin arose and gave the beggar his own fine robe and bad the deacon bring him another robe which was of lesser quality that night as martin preached the word the flock of god saw a soft white glow of light around his person surely this was a great man a true messenger to that age never desirous of ought but to please god he lived a most consecrated life never could he be induced to preach until he had first prayed and was in such spiritual frame as to know and deliver the full counsel of god by the holy ghost sent down from heaven often he would keep the people waiting while he prayed for full assurance just to know about martin and his mighty ministry might make one thing that the persecution of the saints had abated not so they were still being destroyed by the devil through the instrumentality of the wicked they were burned at the stake they were nailed to logs face down and wild dogs were turned loose upon them so that the dogs would tear away the flesh and bowels leaving the victims to die in terrible torture babes were ripped from expectant mothers and thrown to the hogs women's breasts were cut away and they were forced to stand erect while each heartthrob poured out the blood until they crumpled in death and the tragedy was even greater to think about when one realizes that this was not solely the work of the heathen but many times it was caused by so-called christians who felt that they did god a favor in exterminating these loyal soldiers of the cross who stood for the word and obedience to the holy spirit john 16 2 they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god's service matthew 24 9 then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake by signs and wonders by the power of the spirit martin was truly vindicated as the messenger to that age but not only was he gifted by a great ministry he himself was forever true to the word of god he fought organization yes god bless you brethren something was in that that paragraph on top there was something very astounding astonishing when martin became so it says here actually it started here behind it says when martin started serving god the devil was mightily arosed the enemies of truth hired assassins to kill him now when you look at this this chapter here it is showing how the devil threw the wicked instrumentality of the wicked ones people were banned people were given to actually have a video on my computer people were burned people were we are beaten people we are people we are fed to lions but when it was coming you know you know when there was a summon when they were preaching and this edge where we are all the spirits and all the challenges which happened in the past ages they're going to be in this age what was inefficient what was in programs what was in theater what was in sudden so one thing which came to my heart when we were passing this part that if the uh the the paragme and church age people were here yeah we are blunted we are tortured the things will come to us the major point we need to learn here is when they come to us it should not be news you know you know it is very much taught in the pentacles the world when you're suffering you don't have a job when you don't have money when things are not well they the the pentecostal religious teachers and people feel you are cast god doesn't know you god doesn't love you but in this age god gave them the grace that we have killed were christian and they come and cut off your head and your sister sister sister sister peace become a trick trick trick and a christian even speak in tongues and they catch you pregnant woman they come and remove the child and they throw them on down they give them another christian speaking in times they are leaders in the church but did it mean that god was not caring for them no so that mindset is very wrong never think suffer problems challenges bad things happening around you they're happening maybe because you're sinning maybe because you have cases no sometimes christians holy spirit filled heading to the promised land can't go through these things that's right they can't be tortured and god is aware he's watching my brother you don't have a job and he knows it you don't have man and he knows it even right now what the world is going through the heavenly father knows everything he knows that you're sitting at home he knows that you don't know what to do and everything is in place yes amen amen amen may the lord bless you oh thanks brother for that submission we're so grateful that is what happened to jesus yeah one was our example sure he was killed by religious people exactly the herodians pharisees they killed him not because you have something bad yeah but the religious and we're seeing also the people are going to persecute the foolish bargains those ones are also going to be a religious group so in each age was a religious group persecuting the others he withstood sin in high places he championed the truth in word and deed and lived out a full life of christian victory a biographer wrote of him on this wise no one ever saw him angry or disturbed or grieving or laughing he was always one and the same and seemed something beyond mortal wearing on his countenance a sort of celestial joy never was anything on his lips but christ never anything in his heart but piety peace and pity often did he weep for the sins even of those his detractors who when he was quiet and absent attacked him with viperous lips and poisoned tongues many hated him for virtues they themselves did not possess and could not imitate and alas his bitterest assailants were bishops the salutation revelation two there's something up here he says about this statement the brothers picked from this it says that his bitterest asylums were bishops you know very many people think that the serpent seed there are those drunkard people there that those as the the prescripts on the road the serpent said brother branham said kyle was a religious man he was a religious man now when you look at the major group of people which tortured brutal and did very many bad things to believers they were doing religious people now let us bring it back to us now jesus said that your greatest enemy will be in your household now to get food from this now it is like this brother shem can do something to you and you can say sister that brother is can you do such a thing now usually the people who let me say that the devil usually uses people who are close to us that is number one he usually uses people who he least expect when you look at peter these guys who are the ones working in in jesus is what when you look at this other these are the guys who are working with jesus but look they are the same where the greatest enemies now to pick from that as i summarize is your brother this brother i am a christian but sometimes i can do something and you really feel oh this man is disappointed so basically the devil can use anybody he can use anybody and that is why we should not hate our brothers right that is why the bible tells us to forgive bishops bishops it means these were high ranking people very big people let me tell you even you even the pastor himself he can tell you something which can cut you in pieces from somebody something with them no don't leave the church so that is what we can take from that part my brother don't when you see people fighting you enemies maybe even at home maybe your father may your mother maybe your sister maybe maybe somebody with you who you thought is very spiritual stand right with god and don't hate people that is what the bible tells us to forgive anything on his did he weep for the sins even when he was quite an absence absent they themselves like what we talk about everything you know to the extent that these people hated him because of because of his virtues i can say that he was bastards he was a christian and that's why i again point out on that that's why we should have the even is is 12b these things sayeth he which hath the sharp sword with the two edges the message to the third church age is about to come forth the third scene of this unfolding drama of christ in the midst of his church is about to be revealed with trumpet-like voice the spirit presents the matchless one he which hath the sharp sword with the two edges how vastly different is this presentation from the time when pilate introduced the lamb of god clothed in mocking robes of purple smitten and thorn crowned saying behold your king now regal robed and crowned with glory stands the risen lord christ the power of god in these words he which hath the sharp sword with two edges lies another revelation of godhead in the ephesian age you will recall he was set forth as the unchanging god in the smernian age we saw him as the one true god and beside him there was no other now in this pergamon age there is a further revelation of his godhead set forth by his association with the sharp two-edged sword which is the word of god hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart ephesians 6 17 and take the sword of the spirit which is the word of god revelation 19 13 and 15 a and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and out of his mouth i know individual individuals is is my um us me is i think someone is someone touching this one how is it now brethren it is fine now so um what was i talking about someone has to remind me because there's something i i really was talking about and then i was talking about the word being a design of the thoughts and intents of the heart how didn't we and then these things got got issues okay so let's get back to that so what i was saying is uh and when the holy spirit gives me something to speak on then it becomes something like a thought like i thought you know like i thought maybe laugh yes i don't know what is it which direction because you can take love on many directions i don't know what exactly i don't take even it is fine now what it is about hashem okay uh please we apologize uh we do not know you need to pray so that uh this thing the devil doesn't uh okay now i would like to know how the sound is right now if that is fine then i think we can go with that okay okay all right so i think there must have been something i wanted to say that the holy spirit was leading me too and the devil tried as hard as possible to stop me so i was reminding you of the meetings which you have just completed recently on the the two consecutive surroundings on the power of free moral agency by the way to those of you who have listened maybe you have even been in the service i am requesting you i've never requested you to go back and listen again because it would seem as if you're not listening to the prophet no i would like you to go back and listen again to those sermons those two servants huh all of us just go back and listen if there are some ones i wanted to listen to again myself people know here that i don't want to listen to myself but those ones those ones because that was a real true inspiration god was speaking to us please go back and listen because i know many of you need to make many decisions in your life and you need to be guided by the whole respect and how to make those kind of decisions so uh brother andrew was asking me to prepare for one of their youth meetings i think i'd have to check that thought again because i kind of thought maybe they also needed some young people there so the word of god is a designer never ever come to church and hear a preacher preaching and then you say oh that he knows me you know it has happened sometimes some place where i was or not everywhere but a preacher preached and a brother came very very angry he said um you know how come you called me a pig because because i was talking about i was talking about it was easter resurrection morning you know i was talking about the the resurrection of jesus christ yeah and under who jesus christ was and why he was the one the lamb of god that to check out the sins of the world he muslim had considered him that's what i was saying he was a sheep he was a what a sheep a lamb therefore adapt rest on him but adapt cannot rest the devil because the time of the holy spirit adam cannot rest on some people with the creatures of pigs of gods of you know you know a pig always loves man that's the goddamn man i appreciate that i called him a pig i didn't call him i could not call him anyone a pig how could they call him a pig but if he failed i called him a pig you know and another sister when when a brother there's a brother who came and preached after preaching for some time then uh you know the world was so good but those of us who were in the church we knew that this brother is preaching about this sister you know i'm like yeah of course the word is for everyone right but sometimes the word comes directly to someone's life so those of you who are around you know everything you know everyone is nature here they can't hear but no they should hear now so uh you know they know you know everyone is nature so uh when uh imagine someone comes up and uh and um and you know brother o'kello you know brother joelle you know isaac and everyone right and then someone comes as a vista from somewhere and begins to roast that person very well so so now you begin you're like ah there's a preacher so not this sister she said this is too much for me the sister said this is too much for me she actually revolted she even went out of the chat while they were still preaching ah she was not happy and then eventually after the service she yeah everybody oh no how could pastor begin to tell my life to that man how could he begin i trusted him as my pastor he went and began to tell everything to him no no no no not already and indeed me i was one of the people who received that man he was a guest when i when we received him he never even spoke to us as ministers and we took him to the pulpit directly so there is no way that he might he he could have known the life of that of that sister but what was happening it was god the word of god designing a heart hallelujah this i saw it working in ethiopia friends when i was in ethiopia when we had just gone there you know the sister would talk to would tell me because even in evangelism evangelism not even in the church would go there meet a person i meet someone i would begin you know we didn't i don't have a formula whenever i meet someone to share the word i just start from whatever the holy spirit leads me you know so the sister will tell me that man you spoke to him everything he has been doing you you were the uh the holy spirit was speaking about it as if you know you oh you know that sister society is quite a character so she was you you undressed him you spoke everything and me i really knew it was the holy spirit that's why i was telling you to continue to continue to continue that's how the word is friends the word is a desire the word is a designer of the thoughts and entrance of man so when you come and you hear peace say ah now my brother might have told you please never do that when you do that you are canon when you hear the word you know touching yourself please receive it please receive it accept it because it is god sometimes even that's why sometimes god doesn't move you know god can come to you like it has happened here several times in prophetic administration or or you know something you know like it can be a time and prophecy it can be anything you know vision or something sometimes i've seen a vision about something sad i think he says the pastor already i told him about that it means he shared that with that person that's right no please believe in the supernatural believe in god believe if you don't believe even if the man knew about your life ask yourself what is it that moved him to speak to you in that manner you know yes what is that that moved him because a preacher under the anointing of the holy spirit is very very different very very different it is not the person that you know that you usually start with okay is usually very very different is god ministering to you god is speaking to you and always listen to that if you do that it will count so much in your life the word of god is a designer of the thoughts and intents the intentions of your heart sometimes even what you've been thinking that you're going to do that is this young man you know you know isaac some of you you remember when we were in prayer here and the holy spirit moved in something like sometimes it does and you know the anointing was so heavy and uh and the prophetic administration was given to him tell me when that serves i think you're doing that service and what you're speaking to the the other brother and uh he he came back to me and said well this time i have believed that god i thought so all jesus has not been believed said this time i believe said why because god spoke to him told him the intentions that he had the intentions of his heart things which had not yet done told anybody but he was intending to do them you know i'm not going to personal things but what does it come to it comes to you to understand that god can god knows your heart right god can design your heart he knows the intentions of your heart even those things which have not shared with anybody god knows what you intend to do and then if i can come and anoint a man someone maybe you know commonly you always talk to say he speaks to you you know maybe by way of a gift or by the word and deserves your heart please whenever you hear that be sensitive to the holy spirit receive it when you know when you can feel god when you can understand when you can design also you must also have some sort of sense of desirement to know that god is designing you you can work and decide oh that's the holy spirit then feel it receive it and apply it upon your life hallelujah emma shall just continue with this now with a sharp two-edged sword john 1 133 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same word was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made which was made first john 5 7 there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one now we can see his association with the word he is the word that is who he is the word in his name in john 1 1 where it says in the beginning was the word the root from which we get our translation for word is logos which means the thought or concept it has the double meaning of thought and speech now a thought expressed is a word or words isn't that wonderful and beautiful john says the concept of god was expressed in jesus and paul says the very same thing in hebrews one one through three god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past under the fathers by the prophets half in these last days spoken unto us by his son logos whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high god became expressed in the person of jesus christ jesus was the express image of god again in john 1 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the very substance of god was made flesh and dwelt among us the great spirit god under which no man could approach which no man had seen or could behold was now tabernacled in flesh and dwelt among men expressing the fullness of god to men john 1 18 no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him god who on occasions would manifest his presence by the cloud or pillar of fire that struck fear in the hearts of men this god whose heart characteristics were made known only by revelation of words through the prophets now became emmanuel god with us declaring himself the word declare is taken from the greek root which we often interpret as exegesis which means to thoroughly explain and make clear that is what the living word jesus did he brought god to us for he was god amen revealed god to us with such perfect clarity that john could say about him in first john 1 1-3 that which was from the beginning which we have heard logos mean speech which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ when god was truly revealed he was manifested in the flesh he that hath seen me have seen the father now back in hebrews 1 1-3 we made note that jesus was the express image of god he was god expressing himself in man to man but there is something else to note in these verses especially verses 1 and 2. god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son i want you to notice here in the margin of your bible you will see a correction the word by is not a correct translation it should be in not by it then reads correctly god spake in times past unto the fathers in the prophets by means of the word first samuel 3 21 be for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord that brings out first john 5 7 perfectly the spirit and the word are one jesus revealed the father the word revealed the father jesus was the living word praise god today he is still that living word amen when jesus was upon the earth he said believe us thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works john 14 10 here it is most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of god in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works that is exactly what we have been teaching all along when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that jesus produced hallelujah the word is god the spirit is god they are all one one cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of god he will have the word of god that is how it was with the prophets they had the indwelling spirit of god and the word came to them that is how it was with jesus in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him jesus both began to do and teach my doctrine is not my own but the fathers that sent me acts 1 1 john 7 16. there's there's a bit there that i really am interested in he says when the bride will get back to being a word bride are you reading with me when the bible gets back to being a white bride she come on read with me she will the very words that jesus produced what are the works that jesus produced number one brethren he healed the sick raise the dead someone said turn water into wine there is a testimony that a brother gave some of you might never ever have had this i listened to it from a person who was sharing it with me i think he was either a witness uh it was on the internet on the youtube so uh as a minister and he he said that uh one day in in the in the church in jeffersonville in jeffersonville brother barnum they were having communion and uh when finished that's right so brother you ever heard of the testimony yeah and so brother never the pastor came close to by the banana i mean the ears and told him when he's finished and of course the people were we are not yet you know [Music] done and there are many more people to sleep to have a sip of wine and and take the bread and so uh brother bran i'm told by the naval let us pray so they didn't involve the church in this you know everybody was continuing what they're doing you know we're there on that day we we take the wine and um and uh take the bread and wash one another's feet while we are praying for one another i hope that we'll be able to do that soon and so as a church so then uh a while by the never prayed with the banham you know it is say that the witness said that he began to see wine you know because there are many like the glasses we use like many glasses small small small very many glasses on a tray that they began to see wine coming up like that filling up all those glasses amen amen when the bride will get back to being a white bride she will produce the very works that jesus produced the very very words when he say that the things i do greater things greater than these things you will do he never meant that we shall do things that are mightier than he did but he meant we shall do the things that he did but more of them will be reproduced in our lives because if it is the same christ which was in him is the same christ in us those very works must be here amen so just for you who said turn water into wine yeah yeah it was this until heal the sick will heal the sick what else did jesus do come on now he raised the dead yeah you will raise the dead in ethiopia we had one day rise up they did they did a party in a village they invited us said we want to see that pastor who raised that lazarus from the dead they called him in in america okay which means the second lazarus the entire village the chiefs everybody came we have the pictures here some of you have showed you some of those pictures when i was in a horse and kind of thing like that the place that place where they come from doesn't even have a a a i mean roads that can pass so we use horses to get there we walked and then we were coming back they gave us their horses so very very far but you know this man the entire village said we want to see that goal we want to see the people who prayed for him we want to see the whole village came and i think more not less than 10 i think should be about 20 about from that very village they came all of them who had about a hundred people we preached to them the message hallelujah amen this god still heals the sick and raises the dead amen amen and also remember jesus saved the sinners yes jesus did what so does this kill steps in us today oh yes do we believe that he's killed some sinners so if you are a sinner he can still save you don't starve for me let me just hide myself with my appetite of sin let me be with it until maybe it will go no if you you are troubled with the sin you come we will pray with you we shall the power of christ in us will save you when the bride will get back to being a white bride she will produce the very works that jesus produced the very works about the joker that jesus produced you shall produce do you believe that hallelujah let's continue right here remember now john the baptist was both the prophet and the messenger of his day he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb when he was baptizing in jordan the word of god jesus came to him the word always comes to the truly spirit filled that is the evidence of being filled with the holy ghost that is what jesus said would be the evidence he said and i will pray the father and he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive now we know what truth is thy word is truth john 17 17 be again in john 8 43 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word did you notice that jesus said that the world could not receive the holy ghost well in this verse i just read neither could they receive the word why because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the holy spirit as the prophets the word would come to you you would receive it in john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you here again we find the word coming because of the spirit of god again in john 16 13 albeit when he the spirit of truth word is come he will guide you into all truth thy word is truth and he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear word of god that shall he speak word and he will show you things to come spirit bringing the word of prophecy you know one thing that i love about this church edible is that brother banham doesn't simply pass his ideas every almost every idea speaks about he brings a scripture every idea brings a scripture so this is not a book okay it's not a book as in a book with ideas but abandoned bringing his opinions like all the books we have in the market uh written by christian pastors and evangelists and stuff like that the church edge book is not like that the church edge book uh is uh a book that throws like a more like a commenter a commenter you know like a bible commentary it doesn't like bring an idea but it only throws light on this very scriptures we have so that's why we always say we have no book but bible bible if you're going to read anything extra like we are doing right now it is really helping us to study the bible that's why we're not calling this a message saturday because the message is not the root here what's the root here the bible therefore whatever we are doing we are studying the bible we are getting to know christ more so this message is not really another like i hear people saying the bible and the message please stop that there is only one thing the word of god and the word of god comes to us in every generation and therefore what we have received in this generation we have it 1200 tips plus what is it it's the word of god so this message is really meant to help us fall in love with god with christ with the bible so the bible is our absolute hallelujah and therefore the message is our absolute interpretation of the bible i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm stealing that a phrase from your father by the political you know he's the one who said that on the ministers for you that the bible the message is the absolute interpretation of the bible in our generation amen that's like paul's message in his day was the absolute interpretation of the bible that they had at that time you know they had the bible and they were like oh you know but we should decide you know peter was saying i know you know the way i see it we should circumcise even we should not eat this and that even we should not by the poor say don't know we can do other things we don't need to circumcise whether you're circumcised or not no problem whether you eat this or no problem now grace has come we are no longer under a school master what was that it was the absolute interpretation of the word of god of the bible at that time hallelujah actually the word bible is not in the bible so when you use bible use it carefully the the what the thing here is the word of god yes hallelujah so because bible actually means a collection of books hey did you know that bible means a collection of books so now that's why the catholics have 81 books and we have 66 books someone now wants to know the difference anyone wants to know the difference oh you already know the difference all right so ask yourself why don't we have the number that they have because we believe that the holy spirit inspired each and every book that is in our bible yes by men to write them and also by men who picked them and put it in the canon and number number number three there are very many reasons number number two this bible was hated by the roman catholic church and they tried to to completely wipe it from the face of the earth they tried to burn as many as possible they couldn't finish them it survived the fires this kjv bible it survived a lot of things survived the water floods it survived everything that could survive but it survived that's another sign it is the authentic book then also this bible it has 66 books and when you check the prophecy of isaiah it has how many chapters 66 chapters and actually when you read through those chapters almost every chapter is speaking of every book in the bible there are very many things that you can be able to look at and surely say ah this bible is authentic it is the absolute truth therefore every man of god who will come in every generation his word his preaching will will um open the people of that generation their eyes to clearly see what god was saying in the generations before us so the interpretation the messengers these seven messengers the interpretation of scripture is the perfect uh and i need to emphasize this before you go back to the reading it is the perfect interpretation of scripture or of the word of god in that generation did you hear that yes now we need to have a standard honestly we need to have a standard what is our standard today yeah i believe that do you have a bible give me a bible give me your bible brother you have this bible this bible is our standard right yes can i surprise you this same bible that is our standard is also owned by the anglican church the same bible did you know that yes this same bible which is our standard is also owned by the pentecostals this same bible which is our standard is also owned by sdas this same bible is owned owned by you know all those groups jehovah witness the mormons and what have you they have this bible and they also call it their word and they read it and they claim to believe it but the difference only is their interpretation their interpretation of the same bible so all the denominations you have today you have them because they interpret this bible in the way they understand it now if we are doing the same thing they are doing it only makes us another group another nomination but what i want to tell you we are more than that hallelujah because we have a standard for this generation oh hallelujah i need to preach on that one day we have a standard for this generation sure like like noah was a standard no other standard nowhere himself he was the standard his word was a sure why the prophecy oh yes in almost 3 7 what does he say surely the lord god speak it with me sure the lord god will do nothing but he revealed his secrets to his servants they they hallelujah so if god used a prophet in the days of noah before a major thing happened on the world he will continue to use a prophet every day because that is his pattern therefore in every generation before destruction or before the end before some major thing happens god must send a prophet with the word of god which is going to be the absolute interpretation of the word of god for that generation hallelujah in the days of moses that was moses in the days of paul that was born in the days of martin luther that was martin luther in the days of uh of of noah that was noah william that was william branham now you find that many people even who claim to believe this message will have their own little you know understandings of the the same word which they say they claim to believe but let me tell you if brother banham saw it this way and i believe you believe is the prophet of this generation you must take his interpretation of it yes not your interpretation of it why because god did not send you as the elijah you have the same spirit by the bottom heart but you are not the elijah of this generation can i hear you say amen you are not the elijah of this generation but you have the same holy spirit that's why you can still preach under the same anointing that he preached under and the same manifestation can also manifest even much more than it was in the days of battle hallelujah why because the same jesus christ is still here on the scene so some people also take that thought and they say so that's why you must not preach again because revelation comes to prophet hey hey please we must preach because the same old gods he had we have hallelujah someone said you know all these titles of brother banham he preached count down come on you have a translator give me more come on count down count down hold the ball attraction prisoner come on fast speak to the rock believe it's not this come on now this is the time everybody speak with your brain coming back you people some of you have not spoken even one message and there are 1200 messages what have you been feeding on are you not the ones who have been listening to this worldly music hallelujah all these titles so someone was saying you know what those are the only subtitles a picture can preach from so don't come and tell us i am going to preach on the power of femoral agents who are you to talk about are you the prophet of this generation did the inspiration come true i said oh yeah i know that the word of god comes to what to a prophet but the word of god has already come to a prophet my generation whatever you're preaching we are preaching we are preaching within that inspiration i'm not bringing a new inspiration it's the same is but the holy spirit is inspiring me still within the message of the hour but paul said about him said i preached what paul preached but he never preached the titles of paul today i'm going to speak on the letter to the corinthians the first late actually today my title is galatians we'll be waiting to you because it is what will say you understand the holy spirit can inspire you to even breach another title as long as your inspiration agrees with the word of god for your day hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord amen also also preaching the title that the prophet has preached is not a scene so you must blast these things when a brother comes next time and say today i'm going to speak on preach speak to the wrong brother what is your own inspiration no no no please stop this the holy spirit can move whichever he wants to move no limitations hallelujah the message is the truth the message is the word of god hallelujah by the time i left ethiopia everybody we had one phrase with you everybody was really loving the message is true the message is true and they usually was saying that because of how they saw the things that was being preached to them the first year their second year their third year and they saw those things coming to pass in a manifestation hallelujah then they had the right to say the message is true hallelujah and you too when god begins to manifest in your life then you'll be able to say the message is true hallelujah praise the name of the lord amen all right let us continue here a little bit i want you to note very carefully that jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of god for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word hallelujah oh you need to annoy that in your book hallelujah amen i love this part hallelujah now of course this part can be misunderstood by some people who are cannot i want you to note very carefully that jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting in and dancing can i read it again yes yes and when i read this right you say amen if i don't read it right you keep quiet or you say no i want you to note very carefully that jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost was speaking in times interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing and therefore those things should not manifest or manga you [Music] praise the name of the lord this is how some people read it this is how some people read it and there are for those things you should not that's how they read it what brother balaam is trying to do he's not attacking these things he's not attacking the manifestation of the holy ghost but he's only trying to say look here that is not the evidence that you have the holy ghost that is only the evidence that you have the manifestation of the gifts of the holy spirit hallelujah but manifestation can be impersonated yes but he says what is the evidence well as much as before we do that as much as it can be impersonated it doesn't mean that the right one shouldn't have it the right must have it actually the right one should have it before the other one who is impersonating it that's how many times you see in the church you can find two people dancing in the spirit one shouting another and shouting and you can surely know this one is an impersonator this one is filled with the holy ghost you can design them i've seen them in the years of ministry i've seen it yes brother i was reading something yesterday in the message debating on the times sometimes yes and the prophet was saying that if i give you this book and it is my gift i have not given you myself yes so you can have my gift yes you don't have me yes that's better you can have the gifts of the holy spirit yet yet you don't have the holy spirit yes that's very absolutely true you can have the gifts of the holy spirit but without having the holy spirit so what should we do should we put all our worry should we put all our worry on on fearing whether we have counterfeit gifts that's what the problem that's the mistake many believers have done that brother banham did not speak it through the genuine believers he was speaking to the pentecostals yes because they were impersonating the gift of the holy spirit but to the believers who have already received the evidence what is the evidence he's saying that the evidence would be that he would be in the truth the truth you will be in the word of god for your work please come on join me now for your what evidence has to do with receiving that word now if you have received that word of your day if you have received that interpretation absolute interpretation of the word of god for your day that is the evidence hallelujah that you are in christ but indeed if you are in christ that manifestation must follow for if it doesn't follow then you lie you are not in christ when jesus christ was here on earth he said that you you said that your father was abraham but actually you are lying why would be would he be able to say that he said you can't believe me in the world and also you can't believe the very words the manifestation you are refusing to believe the word and you are refusing the manifestation verify because of this i know you are of your father the devil can you imagine yes so those two things must always be in your life and this is what the church is trying to say all through major thing two things the true word of god and the manifestations yes if there is no manifestation what you are preaching is not the true word of god we want to see the manifestation brother i love brother charlotte the way he said that sometimes there are churches you find them the zero temperature there is no life there is not no life of movement you know imagine if you were in the bush there and there there is no life of mobile there is no any movement all the grass is just in one place there is no birds there is nothing queen or speaking or waving there is no wind everything is a standstill you would be like oh where am i am i in here you'll be like what is happening even nature itself doesn't have zero temperatures but you find in the churches of so-called believers our churches your churches of course when i say you said i mean you you you the person you i'm meaning you nothing because there's no domination here very cold very cold even and i meant to take another man out of your heart it's like as if you are acting like as an officer yes like the brother is trying to demonstrate it yeah the person is pitching and sweating and you know and you are like just raising up your hand eh i guess you know very very cool huh but how's the service the service was cool let me tell you that's not the church of the living god hallelujah the church of the living god there is happiness that is running around and shouting there is speaking in tongues there is prophet signs there is there is jubilee hallelujah that's how the church of christ ought to be if if you've settled for something less than that you've settled for something wrong oh yeah hallelujah if you read the church in first corinthians 14 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things i write unto you are the commandments of the lord now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what god's prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order paul had to say to those who claimed another revelation verse 36 what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only the evidence of a spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the truth word but to receive the truth word and to believe it and obey it hallelujah can i play that again all right i need to play that again and i need to highlight it here for you to see it clear all right now is that again the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what god's prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order paul had to say to those who claimed another revelation verse 36 what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only the evidence of a spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the truth word but to receive the truth word and to believe and obey it [Music] hallelujah amen all these things i'm reading to you all these things are what and we are sharing i'm not trying to say you produce it no one can produce it hallelujah it is a christ to produce it but if christ is not in you and you try to produce it that's what we call impersonation now you know what is in pentecost now you know because if they don't believe the word of their age if they have not received the true word of god tell me how calm they have those manifestations how come tell me how does it happen that is true impersonations because there is no way you can produce the life of the word if you have not received the word the evidence of the of a spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the truth the word to produce the word to produce the word means to to bring it to pass to make it happen it is not you to do that but yours is receive the truth the word and to obey and to believe it to believe it and to obey the two different things you believe it by accepting it you obey it by practicing it amen hallelujah period the rest is automatic he himself will produce the lights hallelujah he himself will produce the manifestations he himself will produce the gifts he himself will produce the power he himself will produce all those things if he promises in his word remember it is not you that promises it is a ham that promised those things when he says that these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out demons in my name they shall pray for the sick and they shall recover what does it mean in my name they shall do those things are you going to produce it no no they shall preach and the people shall believe are you going to save them no but what you do you believe the word and you obey the rest it is to produce itself some people get worried oh no me i can't even talk a trunk you can't even do it i can't even sing i can't even do that i don't even know how to say my voice is when i begin singing it's like you know what you know it cracks it does this and that because you are not surrendering yourself do do two things believe the one and obey it believe the word and practice do the things don't just be a believer not a doer they always say hear us only but not do us be a hero and i do what you have had practice it in your life once you practice it in your life then you're going to begin to see the fears happening hallelujah the tree it only has one thing to do to obey and to believe what god has meant for it what is it the water is in the ground somewhere the tree will not worry oh now you are planted with me here where will i get water my roots are going to suffer even how can i bear fruit no it is only planted once it is planted in the good ground it is automatic when the rain comes hallelujah that the roots will push down push down and it is automatic the fruits will come anyhow hallelujah so those fruits of the spirit will come anyhow those gifts where people will take and eat and enjoy from you that taste that sweet love that will be around you will come automatically as long as you are planted in good ground hallelujah if the word of god is planted in good ground the ground of your heart whereby you have believed it and deceived it some ground is rocky rocky i tell you it is like on mars some people he's like i don't know he's mass rocky someone help me who has ever been to mars some people's had some people's hearts some people's hearts are very very lucky yeah they're like mountain ranges yeah they're like mountain rings on a mountain elgin or something very very rocky whereby the world of god can't even find anywhere you just plant it there it just goes through some rocks and falls down there and birds eat it you know but i love those people whereby your heart is i have that very good long spiritual soil hallelujah whereby when the world is planted if you are sure it is going to come out when it is planted and the rain comes that's the rain the anointing of the holocaust where you know those times you know come around here and sing and worship god that is it is a must that something must react in you hallelujah why because the word was planted in a good ground amen when others can't understand you you know as i say oh when i get happy i sing and they shout the devil don't believe it i see but i'm filled with the spirit there isn't a doubt and that is what the matter with me you know whereby when you do that people are like what's wrong with him it's just shout it's just too loud you know too loud unnecessarily we talk about the thought but you see it only shows the type of soil the what is the word is the one but what type of soil has been planted as the word been planted in what type is your soil brother and sister what type is your soil if your soil is good if your soil is long long soil that favors plants then it is going to bear the fruits these things we are reading about it's going to happen without forcing it without pushing it without having to first put you in a meeting rather sister neither sit in the meeting and give you concerning if it comes to that it means your soul is still having a problem that's why he said i'm going to fast the first thing that god does oh hallelujah he says i'm going to change the type of yesterday pastor where do you get that from the book of ezekiel he says i will give you a new heart that is your song that's the heart the status of your heart you cannot receive this word with your own heart you can't if you still have your own stony heart you can't receive the word you know he has to first give you the heart of flesh i'll give you a new heart that is what each and every believer needs to have because we are born in this world with a rocky hat with the heart of rocks so you have to first be changed whereby when you hear the word of god god will give you a new heart it will just come in here how will it come i don't know but somehow it will come in and the other one will just be done over with and when you receive the new heart then that's a very good ground for god to begin working on you hallelujah praise the name of the lord sister peace was it you that said that you didn't have a desire for the word you didn't have the desire for those things but now what is the percentage of the desire in you now be be honest be honest don't don't you don't have to say anything to prove what i'm saying just tell me the truth what's the desire in you now what's what percentage between before this study and since we started what's the percentage now what percentage is it at on a scale of one to a hundred where are you like 40 there you are not even above average yet but you are trying you the desire is there and there now actually you you could not even walk there before but now you can walk from home to here what pushes you to work here is it the food or is it the people is it what now i wanted you to see for yourself that's what god did for you you see that moment when the power of god struck you down there don't think that it was where you making it up did you even know what happened to you that was there was something leaving you at that very moment and something was coming in you now do not ever think that now i'm filled with the holy ghost because that happened no but it was the holy spirit working on you you know he does an operation it's a phases what was happening he was taking out the other old stony heart and putting in the new heart now that was an operation that the holy spirit was working on i'm using as an example now that new heart when it comes in you it gives you the desire for the word whereby you cannot listen here when you hear you cannot listen you can settle in you can say you think about it you give it reason all right you you you feel like there's something that is touching you you know but then before maybe you are hearing this is always in my time you know but when you now in the heart amen is change the word begins to settle in yes and when it begins to settle in god also now will give you a new word in your spirit you know what any what when you receive any spirit it is time for god to begin moving hallelujah when you begin to see someone with a new speech but the bottom actually says that when you receive a new spirit it makes you agree agreeable with the holy spirit then your spirit is not the holy spirit it is your spirit okay it is your new spirit because you were born with the holy spirit that holy spirit of yours eh but the bottom actually says that you cannot even live with yourself that holy spirit of yours you can barely live with yourself that's why some people commit suicide some people kill themselves because they have the old spirit whereby they feel bad about everything they feel depressions all the time they you know even even you know it's just like you sometimes your legs can hit one another what is that that's the kind of the old spirit you had you know you can't even agree with yourself how can you now agree with others let alone the holy spirit but if you have a new spirit you agree with whatever the holy spirit brings down on the table when the word of god comes in such power it will bring you the first sense that they leave the holy spirit in the room before others hallelujah when others are still trying to find out what is happening you're already in tears and crying and worshiping god and you know you're already praised and within it in the middle of it you find people like that beginning to prophesy and to speak tongues and bust out and shout and what is happening they have a new spirit hallelujah by the time you receive that god has already paved the way and made it made it enough for you to receive him now you remember the house of canadians they already have received a new spirit to the extent that all the two was for a man of god who was having the holy ghost to preach and anointed someone and while he was preaching their new spirit easily captured that word believed it received it lived it and they received christ himself from the throne of their heart hallelujah and then even the manifestation came immediately they started to speak in tongues and to prophesy that's the house of canadians and they said ah these men who are speaking tongues and unlike us who have received the holy spirit like us then let us let us try to baptize them we see if it is the true holy spirit you will agree with everyone if what you have received is the spirit of god and it is not agreeing with the word please it's not the spirit of god he said please can you come and baptize you said they didn't say our praise can you leave us alone because we have the holy spirit but they said our men take us back and shouting they went in the water yeah i don't know if they never started some water because they were already energized and in you know very very high temperatures of the holy ghost and they went and baptized them and went out again hallelujah that's the kind of god we serve and that god is alive that god is leaving and that god is here hallelujah praise the name of the lord and so what we have learned today is that pegamos was the third church age and as we get deeper into it you'll realize that uh it was not only that god who was working with them uh with by the way well other thing i wanted you to see is that the great the greater the scene or the darkness the greater the light hallelujah you see how darkness was at this time in pegamos and how god was moving and working in martin and these are the saints why because these are they that believed in god and the manifestation of the spirit all through all through there was a little church it was not big it was small but they believed in the word they held on to the truth you know and so it doesn't matter god does not work with numbers god works with those that believe his word no matter how many they are and it's only in the believer's churches where i have seen people preach their heart out even when they have three people 20 or maybe like here 30 40 50 100 2000 you preach the same way hallelujah you know not because the people are so many today i'm going to be announcing so much the reason why they are like that because they know when that happens they are going to to open more pockets so they will they will be more anointed by the god of their stomach because they want to have more but in this message whether you have one soul or two souls you preach the same way whether or not someone is seeing you you live the same life because it's not like a makeup you're not living for anybody you're living for your life to go to heaven your soul to win the kingdom of god so you don't live another life here and another life in your backyard it's the same life because the same christ and you desire the same thing praise the name of god amen hallelujah if we continue we will not stop now but uh we have much to to cover i think we will have to cover it within three subs two services two more services but i really believe that you people are enjoying this yes how many are really enjoying it amen hallelujah this is much much more than what you would have been doing if it wasn't this god bless you sister sarah also god bless you brother martin brother sister sister lynn has been a part of this all through god bless you sister peace also god bless you all uh sometimes it is really very good sometimes when you if when you switch on your videos we can then be able to see you and fellowship with you and know that you are there and following so uh we have we have been enjoying this really really i can see you there by the mountain with your family i'm glad that you're connected and now they can be able also to enjoy uh to enjoy this bible study i'm telling you we're enjoying it i'm going to enjoy it hallelujah amen

reach out to from the previous evangelist evangelism from the previous efforts and still i'm going to invite all the brothers that can really come and sacrifice their time thank god that brother henry is here last time you absconded and disappeared but this time appear if you can again if you can of course martin if you can those of you brothers who came last time if you can please come and we do another moving out [Music] so that you can follow up these people until at such a time when they are ready to be water baptized and be able to continue following you know the word of god so uh that will be tomorrow the lord willing um what time did you start last time at three sorry oh we're supposed to begin at what time at three so brothers by uh 2 30 to 40 we should be here so that uh we go at three we go out and then at least we have about two to three hours then uh those who cannot come you can also come by prayers hey you can dedicate even tomorrow for prayers you can sister unfortunately what are you going to do tomorrow apart from eating and sleeping yeah so you can dedicate the whole day for prayer you know for praying for those souls that we are going to visit in the afternoon you can do that some of you have even never fasted you can decide to fast and pray for them if the lord leaves that pattern on your heart you just fast and say i'm not going to eat since from morning i'm just going to be in prayer praying for those souls so that when the ministers go to speak to them they will be able to see the light sister sarah you are there you can decide to do that and just be in prayer those of you young brothers who are not going to join us you can just be in prayer for us if we know we have you you saw what what happened when you prayed for me when i was going to ethiopia you said what happened yeah started immediately so something can happen god will bring many souls if you really pray prayer is what brings souls and then when they hear the word of god it's coming to a heart which has already been massaged by the power of prayer hallelujah so please remember those needs in prayer and god will bless you and also remember our sunday service and pray brother martin will be taking it um just remember to pray for him so that the lord will be able to use him for our benefit last time the last time he ministered i had very many testimonies from many people both here and also outside the people were really really blessed i'm sure that you will be blessed too amen and yeah there's quite much that that we all are to do there's quite much that the lord wants us to do if we can yield ourselves let us not relent you know there's a lot of inconsistencies we don't know what will happen after this maybe locked another extent maybe not maybe this will happen you don't know but at least you know when you invest your time in the work of god in the word of god you know you have invested in good ground and more so in this message not just churches churches but in the word of god true word of god for this day you know you have made a very good investment hardened well god bless you and you're dismissed in the name of jesus christ well i've got
