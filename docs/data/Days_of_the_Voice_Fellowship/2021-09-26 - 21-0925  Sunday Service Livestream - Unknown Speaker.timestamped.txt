[1:39:42] for herself
[1:39:48] well before
[1:39:50] that you need your head to sing
[1:39:53] you need your help
[1:39:56] you need your head for decisions
[1:40:00] did you realize you can't make decisions
[1:40:03] in life without your head
[1:40:08] and the Bible is
[1:40:14] [Applause]
[1:40:19] even as Christ many Christians
[1:40:26] the church has no rights
[1:40:29] to make any decisions
[1:41:18] it is whenever you
[1:41:20] foreign
[1:42:01] you are not obeying your head
[1:42:05] that's what the church is Jesus
[1:42:29] I can run around
[1:42:32] what what does he says
[1:42:44] the woman where is it here the woman
[1:42:49] who is talking
[1:42:52] the woman shall not wear that which
