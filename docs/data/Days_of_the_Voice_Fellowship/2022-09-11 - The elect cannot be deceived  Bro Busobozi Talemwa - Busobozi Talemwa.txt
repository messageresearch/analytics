use me this morning in the end your children will be blessed just use me lord because i'm coming and use everybody here lord jesus we will all connect with this supernatural woman for the supernatural [Music] amen [Music] and we are going this morning to the book of revelation chapter 6 [Music] is but she was so homesick that she said she has to come home at least for a service they travel all the way from the leader to come and attend this service i want to say god bless you come on come say and i'm reading in the name of the lord and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the football saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and crown and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer him [Music] amen you may be seated so saying this morning i'll be preaching to you but really we'll be delving a little bit deep into the message [Music] and so if you love the message and the mysteries of the word i'm sure that this service will be a blessing to you amen i mean and some people just want to walk over the message and just walk over but i believe we are the uh people of the open book it is a favor and we ought to the deep things are ours alternating is that true and so i'm speaking to you on the subject of the elect cannot be deceived this is our worship this morning am i speaking to somebody this morning what happens is i worship so we i want you to be on the edge of your seat don't just sit and relax and then those those carried out and the since we have another service i don't expect to be wrong english ruling a service and now that's again that wow praise the name of the lord come and even so the earth cannot be deceived and in chapter 6 book of revelation [Music] but you see um dick martin i do not expect you to disrupt me all right so um and i'm i'm asking that everybody please mind your movements because it really affects me so much all right so we have some seats here i see people sitting right ways in the back everyone knows please help me bless the people i have emphasis on the front seats some of those young men just come up here come up here brother solomon unless you're helping the deacons i just can't come right up here mujim turiano all right that that is nice to challenge so the elect cannot be deceived praise the name of the lord come and even i said praise the name of the lord come and give us away praise the name of the lord come here if your neighbor is nothing this early morning just to slap them please and of course we all know on sunday was speaking on redemption of our souls the lion of the tribe of judah became the lamb to see the lions employees i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven close to the clouds and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was actually where the sun and his uh his feet are spirits of fire namaste and he had in his hand a little book open and he said and his left foot and verse 3 and cried with a loud voice come on you can preach with me as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices all right now look at verse four when the seven thunders uttered their voices i was about to write so the thunders had contents everyone had to come beyond him the thunders were not the sounds but the voice spoke to him and said there was a name auntie listen carefully brunch i was about to write i didn't understand i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me love those things the seven thought has happened everywhere to come somewhere you'll get rid of them not so to be wondering because john was not permitted you cannot yeah danielle in the book of uh daniel was not permitted too you know the anger told him find them up history and that would be the but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now do you see why it is important for us to receive the message of the seventh angels because the messengers the angels message [Applause] remained sealed it will remain safe until when took at the until when church until are you following me this morning this is for you tell somebody this is for you guys this is for you this morning the seventh angel malaya it's like a bible class this morning who is the revelation of who is the age of revelation 10 1 malaya yes jesus christ yes to christ the angel the mighty angel he comes down with what yak janaci an open book and it says naganba john do not write them you can't randy kevin you cannot write the contents but in the days of the voice is that the seventh ending this is a mystery [Applause] but without the messenger's message without the message of the seventh angel they are preaching half truth in the in the word of god that will remain filled forever his message when he comes to finish the mystery of god good job and the word of god is god someone will say he will finish the mystery of god he's going to finish all the mysteries of the bible the bible becomes a new book yeah and i think it was peter would say it now let us leave the doctrines of baptisms of of repentance of laying one of hands of peace of god let us go on unto perfection there was a petroleum again all the denominations just are laying the it is that's why some people get me get this message you are not going to be raptured talking you need to be capped off whether or not you need to be the omega bride wait a go room glory ascend by you praise the name of the lord come here and so now here in the book of revelation chapter six saying come and see. and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and had a crown and a crown was given out to him and he went for conquering unto conquer no yeah i took the congratulations you know the bible speaks of beasts could um beasts and the beasts sorrow all right now there are four living creatures what will a return the video which the bible also refers to as forbidden and this is the devil saturn and how people in the tribulation will get the mark of the beast actually they already get in the mark of the beast today by rejecting the revealed word and the things i'm speaking to you is because i have had the seventh angel's message so it's not my it's not i'm not the sauce the things we preach in this chat an introductory mechanism is because we have heard the message of the last days we have had the end-time message we have received the messenger of the end times to stand before you and i tell you i have heard the message of the hour bully i'm not ashamed to quote it for you i'll just see what you are saying preach i will claim to believe is now i was listening there is a very wonderful message that brother eddie biscuit preached some years ago and i found this this phrase very wonderful uh from that verb i quoted it and i thought i should read it for you uh coming from the from the north from northern canada and being a hunter yeah to be able to rest a while and then he would go hunting with brothers strong enough for the animal you intend to smell wabalang you lay it up on you lay it on its part where it usually passes for its food or for day-to-day life the snail is camouflaged you see the purpose of laying a snail is to cause death man is made with an instinct to worship and this beast has laid its snare on that path of man in sereno let me tell you every human being every month is created with any instinct to worship just loves worship within man to worship they have a tree called nakaima and people you know one day i went there roman again i wanted to see what the people do some people even forsake their homes and they begin praying to the tree because they believe this tree was a certain kind of spirit that formed itself into a tree guarding and so it's been there for ages and ages and edges people worship rivers catch up on questions and enemies people worship things around russian saving people because if they don't worship the living gods they will have to do something else to fulfill the instinct but i want to tell you that thing is jesus christ hallelujah amen and people need to realize that when you're taking that i have replaced jesus never take away listen i'm the devil yes worship me people are not gonna do that i'm gonna try to get your color how many of you are going to worship the devil when it tells you i'm in the devil there they don't worship in the churches they go to or in the worship classes they go to while in their they actually got to worship what are they necessary thinking they're worshipping god but i want to tell you that millions today are deceived the devil has ensnared them satania have a kissing on that path of worship the devil has trapped them standing at attention they never come out flagged as himself the trap is not in a in a glare for everybody to see ah category this is hidden and people get deceived but one thing i want to tell you this morning and you see uh this beast that i was speaking of the devil satan he comes in four in forms when the seals were broken brother [Music] he says i say that a true church would always try to be like it was in the book of acts is that right but we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there is a complete black out of truth and in the last day when the lord is about to appear there will be a total black out of truth that let them fall into a state of concrete deception catholic for there shall be he says in the scripture for there shall be shall arise false christ and the false prophet never christ shall show great signs and wonders there is a true church and a false church ow can you send two fools there is a true vine and a must have people seem to believe but of course that false church can you say that uh first fine buddy always strive to assert the position of the true church oh and of course they are able to do that because they have their fashion denominations and they will tell you that our denomination is actually the one with the truth that's why we do not do that here because we believe that when we baptize you we don't baptize you to be a member of the church that is working when you receive the holocaust you are baptized into the body of jesus christ is worldwide why is christopher what you didn't see or not is that right it's a worldwide body so i cannot be able to say that if you don't come to my church you are going to hell that is but there is one thing that will take people to heaven that is the word of god we need to separate the churches and denominations on the system your what will set us free is the truth and you could say that you shall know the truth have developed some kind of issue within themselves but you know the women call them they kind of figure because we are the believers of the message in our confines that is the deception they are making and forming themselves a religion within the message but let me tell you the message is not a religion there are many people that come to our message chat and will never make it to the rapture there are many people who are preaching this message and they themselves will not go in the rapture we have to become the members of the body of christ [Music] and that begins by the belief of the truth and by the receiving of the holy ghost god is not respect of persons hallelujah amen god looks at all of us in the same way and he has one measurement are making their churches as though it is the one that giving is giving them the certificate to the rapture but foreign so are you a member of an organization or you are a member of the body oh remember watching or remember sometimes i wonder what building the body or whether we are building our organizations so church we are building a body canister mobility not organization organizations will take people to hell if they are deceived but there is a group of people called the island why would i want to wait about the organization we but of course that first church the first fine body will always try to assert the position of the true church and contend that she another elect are they real and authentic with your you know it used to be many people when they come to the message for me they thought oh we are going to a perfect group of people oh we are going to a perfect church okay because god has told us i want to show you a few slightly and brother uh brother isaac if you can put it open but i'm having projected for us on the screen the trail of saturn and getting saturn through the edges engaged all right i want you to look at uh let me get it here okay you will need to touch up this project about a little bit so that the black can get out but the people will see what i'm trying to show the little okay just give me the next line okay so i wanted to look at i don't know whether it would be very clear for you but give me the next statement either all right uh i think it's clear for you to see though so the four horse riders are revelation six rider was actually the therefore yeah now i know denominations think it was christ because [Music] [Music] are you the one going to crown here again and i said that preacher had no revelation the bride oh my god he's actually going to ground him okay to take it yes sir i mean he has no crowns now yes you can go the bible later oh hallelujah i love the word speaks of christ after the tribulation and where we shall we be going but then that's not even the the one that really passes if you find someone guiding somewhere with no arrows would you fear to go there oh it's not about you coming to a message he's going to conquer the whole world but listen to me he is not faith christ see a preacher only but he is christ whoever that christian i mean i he can manifest the miracles but not the words listen to me don't put it is it the bible says bibliogram with all lying to do miracles and signs and wonders [Music] but here i'm giving you a mystery in my way chairman he is a deceiver murima he's claiming to be the right one again but he's a deceiver not because there is no abundance of miracles and wonders but because there is no true word of god let me ask you a question you know the biggest denominational church in the world i will tell you that church is the same church that prays that claims their leader and even the leader of the free world noble korean business goes and prostrates beforehand again he is recognized by all around you will find [Music] but it is supposed to be the church of christ i am the real catholic catholic you the elect of god i don't know you are the real catholic catholic church we are the church of christ in every nation to be the real one and the proof they have foreign was the same one the devil yeah you mushy turn changing colors now choose his challenge when he realized that he's the one who he is trying to deceive cannot be deceived so let me kill them now come on come back so he came through i will show you the next slides he came in the next following church agents yesterday is but the church still was not deceived [Music] before amen the church of christ if i tell you it cannot be deceived when you will not be deceived and then comes another horse rider woman he now came in as uh a black horse right now embarrassing because they did it in latin for themselves and also the latin was also not perfect but then we find that a man came like william chinder what a second about younger william tinder martin luther martin luther and others that translated the bible it was first translated into the german language and hallelujah whereby you are not bothered to read the bible by yourself and actually you are not even interested the last time you had a scripture was last sunday when you came to church can never be the same like the one who does not read that's someone a fan an angle and how can you say you read the bible well you don't even own one i'm asking you i'm challenging you this morning how can you claim you read the bible or gamble changes when you don't own a bible well well i i can hear you say when i have one on my with your bible have your bible that is the best christianity our way of christ read your bible and pray every day some of you even reading the bible in your home is something of the past tv and movies have replaced the reading of the word if you are not if you don't feel the calling of a pastor don't marry have you had my brother you must be the best of your wife but let me not blame them much let me come back to you you can change the stethoscope you can start your own good a good family or and then when the devil sees sit anywhere oh my you cannot deceive this you wanted to suffocate them with famine but they realized i can't suffocate them with feminine teachers [Music] hallelujah amen and this man went from place to place from a certain attempt all over germany germany or now all over england england and by the time they called him back in the mukbang he had finished the new testament and they called him and told him never taken two and said he said william you must recount was not deceived homosexuals are in the world and they believe us today they should do the same thing with them if the devil wants to bring you further tell him i'm going to read [Music] foreigner money and cmb uh politics are you over physique religion whenever this reunite you should smell it is a mess something bad is about [Music] if it's not political and it's not financially fusing yeah i don't have time to go through it all but seeing about the beat ambient the seven seals everybody's gonna have a timeline by the banh wood and uh we noticed that the first seal which is what we read today and boom based okay the spirit of god always raises the standards again is the devil open understand right amen and so in the first first ages [Applause] symbolize emperor we see that that lion was symbolizing the boldness of preaching and follow gomez you can look that you can look at that in galatians 1 verse eight is your sovereignty to your students though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be your cast and we know apostle paul was the one who started the church at ephesus it was paul who taught against women preachers it was poor very powerful who said women should not cut their hair back because it is all right i mean and then when god revealed something to another caton maybe to interpret that time oh my goodness let this one also all this money the same anointing i'm afraid that god gave them cannot give up he gives to us again nothing i got to deserve hallelujah hallelujah because rwanda the last age omega receives all the bloods of the devil good for neither corn they've your nadia satan white red black cherub and so god can negotiate i was in all the anointings the next slide brother and so we notice that then there comes the second age the second what what the second first ride the red horse rider a balance in general and got the believers then he gives them the anointing of a curse against me this is a burden of uh a burden of of sacrifice a piece of burden and only if you are ready to recount jesus put your personal custom where you gonna use if you already recorded jesus go out for my will one by one came out of the church and by the time the people uh to walk up the pasta pasta think about one or two people it says wake up continue with your summon thank you buddy those are your believers and everybody taken off if you were a man of the ones who are attacking you so for sure because it sees you everywhere give me the next slide brother and then comes the black horse the first of man was the anointing that god gave them at that time come and then last the next slide the pearl horse got the chance to win and this is our time and [Music] [Music] higher than any other denominations higher than all the other denominations higher than advantages this is the higher than mormonism let me tell you this is that's the reason why it is not a denomination what other denomination can you call disney cheese joins the eater and they get
