the presence of God came down in such a powerful way that the priest could not Minister the presence of God is here so powerful already tonight it's hard to even speak and I wanted to bring you a message tonight on the love of God but before we do I want to bring you greetings from the Saints in Canada the Saints in Grand Prairie Canada the Saints from Grand Prairie and Canada from Grand PR in Canada and that's that's the church where I minister at the church where brother Tim started the work so we're still there by God's grace just pressing the battle and we bring you greetings from our pastor there brother Darren Boer and all of the Saints you know it's good to be a part of the family of God and it's such an honor to be here with the Ugandan people it truly has been a blessing to us and we just want to do what we can to be a blessing to the bride of Christ so why don't we just take our Bibles for a moment I want to just read a a scripture before we begin it's found in Ephesians chapter 3 and [Music] verse4 if it's all right brother brother and just going to take my jacket off before we [Music] start where I come from it's now 0 degre Celsius there so it's pretty warm here but we're enjoying it it's a beautiful country Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 14 Paul says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ so this is Paul's prayer now of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of God Amen let's bow our heads together precious Heavenly Father we are so happy to be gathered here with Saints of like Precious faith to GA to gather around the word of God to encourage one another in the faith to dig deeper in this word than ever [Music] before that we might know the depths of Your Love Lord I just commit myself unto you I pray that you would have the preeminence in the service Lord help me to get myself out of the way and help the hearer to get themselves out of the way that we might be lifted in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that we might hear what the spirit is speaking to the church bless the reading of the word Lord bless the hearing of it we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you can have your seats you might feel like a small group here tonight but this feels Just Like Home to me this is about the size of our church back at home so I'll preach to you just like I'm preaching at home so I want to speak tonight on the love of God but I I won't be able to express it in the way that I want to and let me tell you why it started about a year before I was [Music] born my father and mother received the message about a year before I was born and both of them received it and believed it with their whole Hearts so I was born into a home where my parents belied this message so I grew up as a young boy knowing the power of God knowing that God was a Healer knowing that God was a provider and when I was was about 9 years old I gave my heart to the Lord was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he filled me with his Holy Spirit and when I was about 24 years old I began to preach the gospel and now I'm 38 years old so that was almost 30 years ago when I was baptized and I've read my Bible from the beginning to end many books I've read many many times and I've listened to every message that brother brandham preached many of the messages I've listened to many many times but in all of that living a my whole life Desiring to know more of God in all of those years I have never yet found How deep the love of God goes I have never yet found how wide it is I have never yet found how high it is as the songwriter said if we with ink were to fill the ocean and what the SK of parchment made if every stock on Earth was a quill and every man was a scribed by [Music] trade to write the love of God above it would drain the oceans [Music] dry nor could the scroll contain the whole of it though it was stretched from Sky to Sky so all that I can do tonight is just share a little bit of the love of God that I know even though I feel like I barely scratch the surface of it let me share with you what God's love means to me amen the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 6 in verse one it says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of God you can turn there if you want BR okay Hebrews chapter 6 and verse one let us go on to Perfection did you read the whole verse yes okay praise the Lorden not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptisms and of the laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and verse three says and this will we do if God permits read all the way to verse three so the Bible says let us go on to Perfection we have laid the foundation we' received the word of God we believed it we were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we've been filled with the Holy Ghost now let us go on to Perfection and Perfection means completion let us press into the completion of God's desire for our lives in order to go on to Perfection we had to receive the Perfection of the word in order to go into completion we needed a complete word of God and that's why God said he would ReStore in this day and he has truly restored in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse 8 we're going to read verse 8 to 10 the Bible says charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away [Music] so when that which is perfect is come or when that which is complete is come then that which is in part shall be done away with God the Bible says God once winked at the ignorance of man because the perfect word had not yet come but now that the fullness of the word is here it is our responsibility to walk in it when you're building a building you need many supports you need many scaffold systems you need many ladders you need many temporary structures but when the completion of the building is come all that is temporary must be pulled away so that the beauty of the complete work can be revealed and that is what God is doing in this age he's revealing the Perfection of his work he's revealing his complete work he's revealing his Masterpiece the the word com the word perfection in the Bible means complete of full age like a man com to full age it means brought to its end and finished it means wanting nothing necessary to be [Music] complete and that's what we want to enter into because that's what God has given us in this day when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away so the building of the Lord is what we're talking about and the building of the Lord is like a pyramid the py pyramid has many [Music] corners at the bottom there's many cornerstones but there is only one Chief Cornerstone that is the one that goes on the top the one that holds everything together and the building cannot be complete and the building cannot be strong until that Chief Cornerstone is in place in Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 20 it says we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone so this message coming down in this hour this Capstone message of God's [Music] work had to be Jesus Christ himself and it was Christ revealed in his in Daniel chapter 2 in verse 44 speaking about the dream that Nebuchadnezzar had there was a great image it had a head of gold and shoulders of silver and a torso of [Music] brass and legs of iron and Toes of iron mixed with clay and and and we know that the Bible says when Daniel interpreted the vision that these were the kingdoms of the Gentiles and we've come down to the time of the iron mixed with Clay but when the kingdoms of the Gentiles came to their end the Bible says that in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all of these Kingdom and it shall stand forever and that kingdom was the stone that was heun out without hand and it came down and crashed into the image but then it grew into a great mountain and that great mountain is the kingdom of God and the Capstone of that mountain is Jesus Christ the Bible says it filled the whole world that's the city whose Builder and maker is God that's the place we're going to and the Bible says the Kingdom of Heaven is within you so that Kingdom begins from the inside that kingdom is perfect love and the Holy Ghost is perfect love and that which is inside of you is perfect love and you can't get there without perfect love all perfect love in Revelations 21 and verse 2 it says I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven it was prepared as a bride adorned for her husand what was it it was love it's speaking about love relationship this kingdom is a kingdom of the love of God it's the kingdom of the word made flesh in the people a kingdom where God and man has become one and God is love we know that because that's what the Bible says and we've experienced it so it came down from God out of heaven [Music] prepare it as a bride Adorn for husband and in verse n it says and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and where did the angel take him he carried him away in the spirit to a great high mountain and he showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God and I saw no Temple therein I saw no Temple therein inside of it the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten him and the lamb is the light thereof amen Luke 17 Luke chapter 12 and verse 32 this is the Chief Cornerstone speaking we might we might feel like the kingdom of God is so far away sometimes we might feel like it's such a great thing like how could we ever attain it but Jesus said fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom so fear not because it's his good pleasure it speaks of a a relationship it speaks of a love that God had for you he wasn't giving you the kingdom because he had to he wasn't giving you the kingdom because you bought it he's given you the kingdom because it's his good pleasure he came down and paid the price because it was his good pleasure the Bible is according to the pleasure of his will it's the pleasure of his will Jesus said again in Matthew chapter 22 speaking to the man who asked him Lord which is the greatest commandment and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all th soul with all th mind so the greatest commandment was love this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it oh I like how he added in the second greatest command lest we should be deceived and think that we can pretend to have the Holy Ghost and then turn away from our neighbor but he was reminding us like he said to his disciples by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you have love one for another so says the second is like unto him Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets the foundation amen so so the the this the building of God is built upon the foundation of love and it's capped off with love so though we are at the top living in the day when that which is perfect has come the foundation must be sure the only way we can reach the Perfection of Christ the only way we can reach all that God has for us is if we start with the sure Foundation otherwise the building will collapse and Jesus spoke to this leodan church and and and he reminded Us of three things he said buy of me these three things and the first one was gold tried in the fire which we know is a Christlike character as the Bible says in Romans 8 verse 29 whom he did Forno them he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so the same character that was in Christ God wants to mold in you and it's something that you must purchase from him so it's something that's going to cost you something and white rment that thou mayest be clothed which we know white rapen is the righteousness the righteousness of the word himself Bible says in Revelations 1978 let us be glad and rejoice and let's give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready she made herself ready there were some preparations there was some labors and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and our righteousness is not our own but he took on sin for [Music] us that we might take on his righteousness it was given to her that she could put it on it was granted to her and and we know that the well brother brandom says in in present stage of my Ministry he says I hope he will Crown my Ministry with this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the cloth of the word and for his righteousness in the message of shamed in 1965 he said just the perfect message back to the word this was the Angel speaking to brother Branham when he was searching for a scripture Lord where does my Ministry fit show me where I am in the word and God showed him this scripture he was the elaser sent to find a bride for Isaac and he had been sent to find a bride for Christ to lay out the cloth of the word that she might be clothed in he says that's a Duty or he says go get that bride that's a duty that's what I'm here for that's what I'm trying to do is call out a bride so when you heard this message and you were able to receive it and you able to believe it it's because God was calling [Music] you because you were a part of the Bride you heard his love calling you and there was something in you to respond to that the Bible says we love him because he first loved us we could only answer the call because he was calling us he was calling our name he was speaking our language there was something about it that gripped us there was something about it that we couldn't turn away there was something about it that it just rang true with the word of God something that you've been searching for your whole life and now here it was the love of God to you in the Bible also says by eyes have that you may see so that so we had to have a different Vision in order to see and we know that God sent this end time message under the anointing of an eagle it wasn't the anointing of a lion it was wasn't the anointing of an ox it wasn't the anointing of a man all of those anointings were Earthbound they could only see so far they could only see to the next Corner they could only see to the trees up ahead they could only see up to the buildings that were in front of them but God sent this message under an eagle anointing an anointing that would lift us up above everything that not only could we see where we are today but we could see where we came from and we could see all the way to the end we could see the destination we could see what it was going to take to get there we could see where all the food was laying and we could just come down and get a hold of whatever we had need of that's the anointing we're living under today where wherever whatever we have need of whatever PR promise we need to lay a hold of today we can see it's laying in the word for us why because it's God's love to his bride he doesn't ever want his bride to be lacking he doesn't ever want her to go without whatever the trial may be whatever circumstances might look like yet you're not looking at what's right around you but you can already see the Finish Line you know he's taking you home to Glory you know he's clothing you in his word you know he's bringing you to completion so it doesn't matter what the storm is like around you you're just going to SAR right through [Music] it because that's the promise of God he said I will never leave you nor forsake you right to the end of the world and you can see it because he's given you the eyes of an evil so we know that this is the Capstone message that the message is Christ because he's the Chief Cornerstone and we know that when that which is perfect is come that it had to be Christ so we know he's the one that holds everything together we know he's the one in the midst of his church we know the opening of the seals was the revealing of Christ the Capstone coming down Christ The Mystery of God revealed and he's come down to complete his work he's come down to perfect his bride so let us go on to Perfection this with this Capstone message if we just keep on feeding on the word of God it will take us all the way there because that's the purpose it was sent Zechariah 4:7 who art thou oh great [Music] Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto so this message came down for his bride he sends the message to his bride with Grace he doesn't come down with judgment he doesn't come down to yell at her he doesn't come down to push her around he doesn't come down to say woman get in your place but he comes down with crying of Grace Grace because she is in position she knows her place she knows that she is called to take the book and to eat the book she knows she's called to receive the fullness of the word that the word might have the pinces and because she is a wife she recognizes the headship of Christ Lord and she gives him the prominences so when he brings down his perfect message his Capstone it comes down with crys of Grace Grace because it's a love relationship because there's a love that he loves his bride and she loves him the Bible says that that day ye shall know that I am in the father and the father in me but that's not all you won't just know who the father is you won't just know who the son is you won't just know that there are one in the same but you also know that he is in you and not only will you know that he is in you not only will you know that the Holy Ghost is Christ in you but you will also know your place you will also know that you are in him for he said that day you'll know that I am in you and you are in me so we've come to that hour where we can see who we are we recognize our place we know we are the bride of Christ and and brother brandham said he said the whole thing is God and man one God's plan was God in man one that he might have his prominences in a people the first place the headship like a bridegroom and his bride amen are you thankful to be living in that day in the message what is the Holy Ghost given for don't you want to know why God gave you the Holy Ghost says what is the Holy Ghost it's God in you what's it for to continue his work among his so he's saying God wants to work through you just like it's a husband working through the wife that when they've truly become one they've been married but that's not all of it the the wife gets to know the husband and the husband the wife until these two become one the Bible says that's Ephesians chapter 5 or might be chapter 4 I'm not for sure so read both but but the Bible says it it it says these two shall become one flesh the man and the woman when they are truly one when they've truly been wed when they truly enter into that Union but Paul says I'm speaking a mystery I'm really speaking about Christ in the church these two shall be one flesh Paul says I'm speaking about Christ in the church that these two would be one so the whole plan of God rate from Genesis to Revelation R from the fall of Man to the Redemption of the Cross to the Rapture of the bride all of it God's plan and the whole plan was that God and man might become [Music] one the word United with man the bride and the bridegroom become one that's the completion of it brother BR says to bring his church together we're still talking about what the Holy Ghost was given for to bring the church to a place in this day this day are they Beyond far beyond the Lutheran meth me and Pentecostal whatever denomination you might have come out of it could have been one even of our own making but God called you out of that he's called you to somewhere higher he's called you to go further and you heard his call because you are the bride he says called you out of there into a place to a place of adoption and the rapturing grace Ephesians 1 and verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times are we living in the fullness of times are we're living in the end times that he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen didn't he say that at that day you shall know that I'm in the father and the father and I am in you and you are in me so the message to his people is a message of Grace it was a message of rapture and Grace he doesn't want us to fear he doesn't want us to be afraid because we are his bride so he wants to take all of the fear out of us in Romans 8 verse1 15 Bible says you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father [Music] so if you are still afraid of that which is around you you you came to God and you believed his word and you were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he filled you with his holy ghost but maybe you're still worried about how you're going to make enough money maybe you're still worried about if sickness might come don't worry just keep pressing into the word of God because the spirit that he has sent us will not bring you to fear it will bring you out of fear it will bring you to a place where you are united with the word and when you become one with the word our all fear will vanish Hallelujah because God's Capstone in your life is Christ is perfect love and perfect love casts out all fear so just keep trusting in Him say Lord I I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow but I know that you are in control [Music] tomorrow brother Bram says in the first seal he says and when John started to write those other seven Thunders he said don't write it he had been commissioned to write everything he seen But when these seven Thunders over in Revelations 10 uttered he said don't write them at all they are Mysteries we don't know what they are yet this was in the first seal but my opinion they'll be revealed right away and they were because we know in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound all the mysteries of God were finished and he says and when it do when it does it'll give faith for that rapturing Grace for that church to move out so that message that was revealed under those seven Thunders was a message of completion there couldn't be anything else after [Music] that because all the Mysteries were finished so what was given under those seals had to be the Capstone message had to be Christ to bring the church into Christ to make known his full attention in his full intentions and his love all things must come up into Christ Ephesians 4:15 it says but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so where is he bringing us to he's bringing us to Christ so we have a sure Foundation 2 Timothy 2:19 says nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his hallelujah amen and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity Ephesians 28 and9 for by Grace you are saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast so so this love that we speaking of entering into when Jesus when when in Revelations it says buy of me gold try in the fire in white rment that thou mayest be clothed and isab that thou mayest see we're not speaking about works that we have to do it's not going to cost you works but it's going to cost you surrender to him because he is your headship so we must give all diligence to make our calling and election sure to let the word wash us that's the labor is to stay under that washing of the word to let it continually bring us into line because it's him doing the work he can only work as long as you allow him it's just like a husband and a wife he can only bring her into His Image just as much as she'll allow if she wants to live her own life she wants to have her own career and she wants to chase her own dreams then these two shall never become one flesh that's right and if you want to chase after the things of the world when the Holy Spirit is trying to wash you and God is saying don't do that God is trying to wash something out of your life but because of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes because of the deceitfulness of riches it keeps attracting our attention we can never come into His Image we can never become one with him so we have to labor to be under his head we have to say Amen to every word when we say Amen to the word we're not just saying it with our lips but we say it with our lives because it's not what you say it's how you live and we can say whatever we want we can profess whatever we want but it's our life that proves out who we are so if you say you believe something say it with your life say it with all that you are say it in every decision that you make always put Christ first but don't do it just out of works it must be done out of love and you can only do it out of love when you've been born again by the holy spirit because then it's Jesus on the inside working towards the outside changing us from glory to glory clothing you in the word of God hallelujah second Corinthians or second Timothy 1 ver9 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was was given us in Jesus Christ before the world began so you've been called with a purpose God didn't just fill you with the Holy Ghost for no reason he didn't fill you and say that's the end of it but he filled you so that he might be your guide he filled you that he might lead you to the fullness of the word Bible says if that the spirit that same spirit that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead if it dwells in you it shall also Quicken your mortal body so the only way that God can Quicken you is from the inside out and the quickening of the word the quickening it means to bring us in line with the word of God to Quicken your mortal body means to bring it in line with the word of God to bring it in line day after day to wash you day by day until you're a bride without spot or wrinkle the Holy Ghost is the quickening power of God and it keeps quickening and quickening until one day the very fiber of this Mortal body is changed because the Bible says that this Mortal must put on immortality in this corruption must put on incorruption why does it have to do that because the word said it well because you're his [Applause] bride and he is perfect he is not mortal but he is Immortal he is eternal so if the husband is immortal and the husband is eternal and the husband is perfect he would never leave his bride in imperfection he would never leave his bride in corruption so he says fear not little FL fear not my bride for it's the father's Good Will to give you the kingdom to give you the fullness of his word amen hallelujah so we are called according to his purpose Ephesians 1 verse 9 it says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure he made known his mystery to us he he didn't do it because he had to he didn't sit back with his arms folded say oh my they're just not getting it oh if they just try a little bit harder oh if they just work a little harder but no it was his good pleasure it was always his desire to reveal his will it was always his will to reveal the Mysteries he knew you would need the mysteries in order to receive a body change the only reason he didn't give the Mysteries before was because the word that was hidden underneath there it would have produced a Rapture but it wasn't time for a Rapture yet because you weren't here yet and before the foundation of the world you were called according to his purpose so it had to wait until you were here it had to wait till the last one was here that he might reveal his Mysteries so that then the time that it would take to produce a rapture would be just the right amount of time so that the last one the last member of the Bride the last one that he knew would receive it be here on the earth because he's not leaving one behind he told us the parable of the 100 Chief how that if he counted them and there was only 99 and one was missing he would leave the 99 and he would go and find the one so God had to wait till the last one was here because he's not leaving one behind said don't worry tonight he's not leaving you behind but he gave you his [Applause] word because you are coming home you're a part of his bride you're here tonight because you're a part of him you're receiving this message because you're a part of him you receive this message because you could receive it and only his bride can receive so you've got it tonight so don't worry little FL it's the father's Good Will to give you the kingd so just keep feeding on the word of God keep laying a hold on the promis keep pressing through every trial because he's building a faith within you as you patiently endure he doesn't just want you to know him as God but he wants you to know him as husband he wants a close relationship with you he wants to he wants you to know him he he allows sickness into your life because he wants you to know that he's a sometimes it can look so bad sometimes it looks impossible but he wants it to look impossible he wants you to know that that the only one that could possibly get you out is God himself because he wants you to know that he did it he wants you to know that he is the one that came he wants you to know that he's the one revealing to w oh it's a personal relationship it's not just God in his church it's not just God in heaven it's not just God in Christ but it's God in you oh he wants to be so real in every one of our Lives until we're just walking with him every till every thought is the is a word thought tell every decision that we make it's a word decision oh every time we get up in the morning he wants us to walk according to his will until these two become one flesh all the union of Christ in his blood God and man becoming praise the Lord how are we doing for time Brothers all right praise the Lord hallelujah we've laid a good foundation and he's made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure that he purp he made this decision himself he didn't come to us and say what do you think would you like to be a part of the Bride in ourselves we would say oh we're not worthy how could we possibly be a part of the of Christ but he already made this decision himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times as we are he read that he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom we have obtained an inheritance so in Christ Jesus you will find your inheritance in Christ Jesus you will find all that belongs to you when you are married to him when you are united with him you will find that everything that belongs to him it also belongs to you the Bible says we are more than conquerors through Christ who loved us because he already conquered and he brought it home to his wife and he says this now belongs to you oh you need healing he brings it home he says this belongs to you you need Deliverance he says this now belongs to you you need provision he brings it home and he says this now belongs to you because you are his bride and he loves you so everything that he did it was for you just like everything that a man does is for his wife when a young man sees a young woman and he falls in love with her no other girl means anything to him it doesn't matter how beautiful the other ones might be there's something that's happen between him and this [Applause] special oh you might look at other churches and say they're so beautiful you might look at other ones and say Lord it looks like they have so much they have so much money they have so much education they are just this big International group that even the governments have recognized like in Ethiopia our brother they said oh if you don't have this certain Paper you can't preach here even even the world has recognized these certain churches and we look at them say oh they're so great but God says what does that matter I'm not looking at them I don't got no eyes for them how do you know that God doesn't have eyes for that because he didn't give his word to them he gave his word to you Hallelujah glory to God Amen GL Glory Glory sorry my screen just keeps jumping around maybe it's getting excited too hallelujah hallelujah all of creation's groaning waiting for the manifestation of sons of God there's a little bit of creation somewhere in here there's a little bit of God's creation somewhere in [Music] here so it must be jumping around too where are we we in him we obtained an [Music] inheritance predestinated that means God made sure it would happen because he forew you he could predestinate because of his forn knowledge because he knew you would receive it so he could work out events so that his word would come by your way predestinated according to the purpose of him him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will brother brandham said in the message adoption he said God's will is a mystery and if we stop there we think oh I guess I'll never know the will of God but he says each man has to seek out the will of God his herself God's mystery so it's mysterious to you who you are but it's not God's will for it to stay a so dig into the word of God find out who you are if you're wondering about whether or not God loves you take into the word of God so can find out how much he loves you Colossians 2 and verse 6 you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him oh we got the message brother Sten so walk in him walk with him every day rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving so rooted and built up in him if something is rooted it's been through some hard work Jesus talked about the the wheat that was sewn and some of it fell on Stony ground and it just sprung up really fast and when the sun came and beat down upon it it just withered and died so we can't have Stony ground but we've got to have good ground and when we have good ground the ground of our hearts has been prepared now we can be rooted in Christ and to be rooted it means to push down deep as Paul said I want you to know the depths of the love of God so a tree when it grows they say that the roots of a tree are two or three times bigger than the top so what you see on the top is small compared to what is on the bottom so we always want to be seen and we want people to see what we do for God and we want people to see our works and we wonder why we're always falling down if you want to do something for God then you got to put your roots down in the word you got to feed on the word so that the roots go down deep you want you want to do something big for God then put the roots down the bigger you want to be for Christ the more you got to feed on the word oh it's easy to sit in the presence of the Sun and grow and grow and grow when the sun comes on the tree it just it it just grows leaves and it just produces fruit and the sun pulls everything out of it everything it possibly can and if there's not enough moisture down underneath if there's not enough Roots then it can't come to a place where it gives fruit it will wither and die before it get there but we want to be fruitful in Christ we want to find our purpose in Christ so we got to dig in deep we got to have a lot to draw from we got to have a lot on the inside feeding the holy spirit of God so that when God starts using our life then we have a lot to give for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead body and you are complete in him and besides this Peter says giving all diligence besides what besides the foundation besides the holy spirit that has given you the potentials of everything besides that now you must give diligence to press into all that God has for you that's the work that's the labor you must give that's the price you must pay is your diligence to lay in the word of God because when Peter says add to your faith virtue knowled to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience patience godliness to Godliness brotherly kindness to brotherly kindness love he's he's speaking about a relationship he's not speaking about Works he's speaking about your relationship with Christ he speaking about walking with him speaking about this is how your relationship will grow faith is your foundation and you have a good foundation so we want to go on to Perfection and we want to add we want to add virtue which is strength so as you get to know him and you feed on the word it adds strength to your relationship we're speaking about these two becoming one and they can only become one if you really get to know one another so your relationship must be strengthened and it comes by the word of God your virtue knowledge as you begin to know someone your knowledge of them grows when you know Jesus Christ when you walk with him day by day not theology not intelligence but experience this is a relationship with a person with the person of Christ so you are walking with him you're getting to know him your relationship is strengthening because as you begin to know him you begin to find out that he loves you just like that young man and young woman she he's got his eyes on her but now he begins to spend time with her and after a while she begins to recognize that he's spending a lot more time with me than he's spending with anybody else there's something different Happening Here I think that he might love me it's a deeper relationship so as you begin to know Christ you can only know him when his holy spirit dwells within you Jesus said except you be born again you cannot see the kingdom of God but you when you are birthed by the word of God and what did Brother brandham say the new birth was it was the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you so you recognize who he is you never paid no attention before but now that you recognize that he has an interest in you now all of a sudden you're looking to him as the Bible says in Hebrews 12 laying aside every weight and the sin that be easily besets us let's look to Jesus the author and finish of our pressing towards that Mark so as we see that he has an interest in us now we need to lay aside all the distractions and we need to begin focus our eyes on him because there's something special happening and you don't want to miss it you don't want to miss what God has for you you don't want to miss your healing you don't want to miss your provision and you don't want to miss a body change so we got to keep our eyes on him because there's something special that's happening here this is a love relationship going on and you recognize that he loves you and you recognize that you love him that you came to this word because you fell in love with it you said I believe Lord you said I want to I want to be identified with you I want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I want your Holy Ghost why was it that you wanted those things you look back to there and you recognize it was because you loved him and then you found out in the word you found out that you loved him because he first loved you so now you recognizing that this is a relationship and there's something inside you that says Lord I love you and now Temperance begins to come in your life Temperance is your desires being changed in the Holy Spirit transforms your desires you realize that you no longer desire the things of the world you no longer desire the things of the old man you look back and you say all of those things have been washed away from me you say ever more Lord give me this word like the disciples said to whom should we go for thou alone has the words of eternal life said Lord just keep feeding me this Lord I just can't get enough of it it's it's not because I'm trying to escape hell it's not because I'm trying to be better than the next person it's not because I want to look down on my neighbor it's only because I love you Lord because there's a relationship going on and it's a love relationship just like just like a a husband and a wife oh she just begins to look to him and she begins to to to try to understand what he likes because she wants to wear the things that he likes she wants to learn how to cook the things that he likes she wants to know everything that he likes she doesn't want to miss anything because she wants to please him she recognizes that he loves her and she loves him and she doesn't want to miss this opportunity oh my that relationship gets closer oh into Temperance comes patience as you walk with Jesus Christ you get to know him and you know his word and you know what he likes and you know how he works you know how he comes you know how he heals you know how he delivers because you've experienced it because you've been walking with him so now as you walk through life now you have patience because you know he's working because you know his word says all things work together for good what good to them who love him those who have been called according to his purpose so now you are just walking with him and you have patience with him because whatever the trial might be whatever the hardship might be you know he's working it for your good you know everything is in his hands oh you're just resting in him glory to God into patience comes godliness because you're walking with the Lord you just can't help but have all of the world washed off of you you don't want the things of the world you don't desire the things of the world not cuz you're trying to be a good you just can't help it anymore you're just in a love relationship with the word you're not trying to put it on it's the Holy Ghost doing it the Holy Ghost is working for me ins oh he washing you like as the Bible says that Christ would wash his bride that he might present her to himself as a Chase virgin not having spot or wrinkle or any such oh and from from from godliness to brotherly kindness oh the holy spirit of God working in our lives notice what kind of a bride that he's looking for not looking for one that just forgets about everybody around her but no Jesus said that by this shall all men know your my disciples nether shall all men know that you're part of my bride you have a love one for another the closer you get to Christ the more that you just want to bring everybody else in with you the more you get burdened for those lost souls the more you get burdened for your neighbor oh praise the Lord oh he doesn't forget anyone but he knows the burden of our hearts and he adds brotherly kindness to our godliness oh he bre there's such a love one for another such a burden one for another till we if we see somebody stumble if we see somebody backslide we don't say ah they never had it in the first place but we just want them to come back just come back just repent of what you done the Bible says if we repent of our sins if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our oh no matter how far someone slides back we don't know whether they're seed or not so we just do everything we can to bring them back CU in our hearts we just hope that they're a Believer too you don't want anybody to miss it when you've experienced the love of God you just don't want anyone to miss it and brother Bram said when he went to the other side he said it was perfect love and he said thus sayth the Lord you can only get there with perfect love the Bible says the brotherly kindness he adds charity as you give diligence to heed to the word of God as you press into the word of God as you feed on it day and night holding by faith to the promises of God he's building you up building you up building you up Bible says line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little we might feel like we got so far to go but just look back and see how far he's already brought you oh there's the quote right there in the the message adoption number four thus sayith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all that was there no matter what money how much religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you done whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you're just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you glory to God in the message thy house brother Bram says when you go to church you say well I'm going to join church I'm going to be baptized if that doesn't come from a heart of love to God it'll never go nowhere all you'll do is just join church and be baptized but when you are converted to Christ a love to Christ then you accumulate a faith in Christ just like you would to your wife or your hus you accumulate a faith that you walk in that Faith just something about you you just got something that anchors you in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed this is God's great mystery of Love expressed that God and man became one the whole thing is God and man [Music] one and the Bible says in 1 John 4 and there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear has torment and we're talking about a marriage relationship and what kind of a marriage would it be if there was torment there what kind of a a marriage would it be if the wife was always terrified of doing something wrong but that's not how God expressed his love perfect love cast out all fear as you walk with Christ you walk with him in love he casts out all fear he cast out all doubts until you know that you can never be lost until you know it's just him and you do you know that youve met him in that secret place something is different that you never be the same you look at the Bible in a new way a way that you never looked at it before anytime you open the pages of God's word all you see is God's love to you Romans 8:35 it says who shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter oh what kind of love is that but when you are in love with God when you come to a place where he's open his capsule message to you so you not just see that the message is true but now the message is in you now you have become the message and when you become the message you know it's not about these Natural Things anymore but you are just so in love with God you know you're part of his kingdom you know when John saw that New Jerusalem coming down that you were there that when brother Bram saw them on the other side that you were there because you are in Jesus Christ not only have you recognized that he is in you but you'll recognize that you are in him and death doesn't matter anymore we are counted as sheep for the slaughter all these things we are more than conquerors not by ourselves but through him that loved us for I am persuaded Paul says that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present it doesn't matter what the circumstance is right now no things to come we might think that there's trouble coming down the road when you are in love with God it doesn't matter anymore it's just you and [Applause] Christ nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God and where do we find that love is in Jesus Christ Our Lord amen can we stand and worship Him Hallelujah brother bus won't you come amen glory oh Hallelujah do you love him glory to God
