upon this slain that they may leave so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet and exceeding great Army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our paths therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the Lord God the Lord O My People I will open your Graves and cause you to come up out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves o my

[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] you may be in that Valley this morning but this service is meant to encourage I may be in that Valley this morning but listen to me now he believes the spirit of God is here this morning to do something in your life are you on a backwards you can never come in your life and you remain the same and the spirit of the Lord carried Ezekiel and took him in a valley full of dry bones him to pass by them around above there were very many in the open valleys and here this scripture read it one time as a pastor in Ethiopia that little church starting up and this sister was going through she had gone a lot of uh through a lot of problems in her life and since she believed the message it seemed as if God was not working for her she was going through a lot of trouble and you know Financial constraints problems on every side came to me in the office crying I was a young Pastor I did not know what to do in such instances but you see what would help if the spirit of the Lord came in the room when the spirit of Lord comes in your life he makes a difference that very moment I closed my I was sitting back in my chair and she was messy all over there the other side of the of the bench I just sat back in tour and I closed my eyes because I was trying to feel what she was going on I was trying to relate what with what she's going through and at that very moment the spirit of the Lord came in the room I tell you whenever the spirit of the Lord comes in the room something always happens not not a god of doctrines only he's a God that comes out from the pages of the Bible it comes into reality for sure and again he is not just a more that we are worshiping is a living God and at that moment I experience this power began to carry me up in the dreams of Revelation and you know things began to open up this scripture came in my mind I didn't even know I I don't remember I had not rehearsed it against it but I I told the sister the word of God says but you see my sister he is asking you this question is but why did he ask as a kid because he wanted to know yeah [Music] he wants you to be involved in the Miracles in the miracle of the transformation of Our Lives don't just lay there come on anointed what do you say here is the situation of your life not what God says will you remain like that or can God move you and do something new in your life and Ezekiel was lying there as a kid yeah you know that reminds me what happened with Moses when he reached the Red Sea he started crying the Egyptians Moses why do you cry there is a lot more in you than you know your mind that's why a Believer must never speak either word that's why I do not always like jesting and laughing about things whether I'm going through a bad situation I always say I am rich and actually even in real life many people think I have a lot more than what I really have in animals whatever I prophesy in my life it happens foreign [Music] let me tell you we need to learn to speak to the storms the scripture says death and life are in the power of the past tell your neighbors amen it's not the time is the confession of the past and it's not a tongue that will do it because it is the spirit of the Lord which is going to come and follow the words of a Believers and here you know there's power man yet in the tongue and as I began to speak to that sister I spoke to her and said what do you say about the situation why do you cry can you live again God restore you attack to your glory all this money that is lost all this business all your life and I said my sister what do you say professor prophesy to the bones hallelujah amen prophesied with his bones then saith the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto this born regular [Music] it God followed those who were tattoos and the first time you prophesied there was a noise and the bones came together everything was not yet perfect because there was no life and all the same news they also developed the flesh Came Upon him let me tell you my brother my sister I'm gonna take you through your situation do not rush the process God does not see you as a failure God see you I sees you as a perfect bride a perfect job hallelujah amen your parents can failure your friends it can never happen foreign and at that moment you can say that I spoke through this system she had come from Dubai and worked there many many years and made a lot of money when she returned back to Ethiopia you know all these pastors the fake pastors in the name of frost prophecies you know you're gonna get married she wasn't married she she she didn't have money all that money was lost she became frustrated [Music] situation it seemed as if God was not coming through foreign that he will come through for you then that is not faith is on the basis of believing without seeing okay hoping without knowing knowing this one thing in your heart what he said is good enough for me I may not feel it I cannot say it I may not smell it because foreign I know she was all um you are going to get a job not in a very long time it's going to be a powerful day and if this doesn't happen I will repent yeah and I will confess it to everybody because these are not my words two weeks one two weeks we came in 14 days God ended a suffering that was for more than 30 years chick long story short and she was asked a question how much do you want to earn oh yeah and she spoke any amount she thought it was the largest [Music] sin and they told her welcome on board and they gave her the job a big American company they wanted someone who was qualified none of the people that were sent that we are qualified in paper actually went through but the one that wasn't qualified she didn't have any papers she was given the job and she had that job enough for more than three or four years God gave her a husband mommy God gave her a family foreign prophesy to the bones as believer Believers need to come to a time when we don't want to believe in what God has said to us because his word he can never failure his word is never negative amen and he told him that these bonds that you see is represented in the house of Israel see they were dried dried bones meaning all hope was low that's against us they were cut off from their parts he is speaking of Israel as a country because there was a time that Israel was dispared and they were never in their Homeland and they were taken into Exiles [Applause] that God was prophesying you know these boys that were in the valley was representing Israel all the Hope was lost never be remembered by God again here God sends one of their prophets come on let us take a walk whenever God calls you for a walk with them something for me hallelujah amen I don't know about your brother amen 16 years ago yeah I've seen Miracles demons hallelujah amen praise the name of Allah foreign when we come to hear the words it is [Music] here this morning it must work for you no matter your situation you may be drier than those dry bones and at that moment like I said you know when Ezekiel reached that the value of dry bones exactly where you're too coming true foreign [Music] foreign but here God was telling us I am going to disperse you in the question I'm gonna disperse all Israel you will go to the corners of the earth they will think that their God has left them don't think they'll never be in their Homeland again they will go through the Holocaust they will go through everything they will go through whoever will rise against the land I promise foreign you come down from heaven through the clouds according to the Book of Revelations we are pointing to the multitudes of three nations tongues and people foreign Roma Rome is in control of the world and here that Roman is the most taken over the whole world and then we find out that there was also his feet Mighty angel came down he put his right foot on the sea chicken what does that mean he put listen what are the periods of fire and prices we the body of Christ foreign foreign [Music] America America actually is the source of all immorality America yes you know the gayism the homosexuality

country to spray their Gospel of homosexuals and all their planes were painted with their filthy fraps and that's the agenda that they have but it all comes from Hollywood who comes from America

in the Bible my Bible when was that done we find that Esther called for a collective first because that there was a problem that faced all of them and they needed to fast and break otherwise real prayer and fasting individuals does not work with us the way he worked with the Jews we ought to have people putting up an island in the church almost every day but everybody on their own way like when you come here nobody pulled you somebody have a sister but we are all here together now let us have church in the same way a prayer fasting meeting must be in fields and indeed if you have the spirit of God in you you cannot say from January to January you never have a burden of prayer and fasting only Brothers you need to you ought to be here at least when you come don't just waste time

revelations it was inspiration Hallelujah foreign became a nation again yeah the Jews are not loved by many people in the world but everybody in the world recognizes that the Jews are not alone you're not alone they are not alone because it's proved it over and over Israel is one of the smallest nations in the world but the IDF IDF which is the Israel Defense Forces is one of the greatest military formations in the world they've accomplished missions that even have left America the IDF IDF one of their emissions was right here Uganda in our country but Germany Uganda is that right our great superpower I mean I mean the Conqueror or muami of the Empire the man who made the British is about to him they indeed did they say whether by force and he was feared across Africa when he captured a plane of Israelis the way they came for their people [Music] the man was when you know if those of you who've never watched that that skid or that movie go and watch it what is it called operation Thunderbolt Thunderbird operation Thunderbolt go and watch it it was one of the greatest operations without our others detecting them and they took their people before I mean would realize praise the name of the Lord one of the greatest operations and that's not the only one they have done many operations there's one they did in um I don't know how they call it the country um one of the Arab Nations that wanted to um yes somebody knows it no that wanted to do a a nuclear bomb what yes yes Iran they wanted to make it Iran Irani is actually what we see here in the Bible and they have always wanted to inhalate and highlight Israel Buddhism and so their purpose was actually a child to remove Israel from the mouth but the way IDF infiltrated and it's not the beginning if you believe in the Bible and you take this Bible is the Bible you know this summer you will find many operations but you will always find it in their operation why they were able to pull it off why they were able to pull it over to be successful is because there was always another General behind them is God himself for the Bible says is the Mighty God great in battle don't we always sing that song foreign and how they were like they were like a swarm of peaceful but a man put together an army of about 45 000 yeah don't worry my brother my sister if God is on your side no one shall be against you Hallelujah
