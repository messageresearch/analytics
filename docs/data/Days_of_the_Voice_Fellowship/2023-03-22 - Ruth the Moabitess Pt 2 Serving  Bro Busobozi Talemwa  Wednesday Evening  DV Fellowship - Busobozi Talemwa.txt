for you know every need in our hearts father come and have your way Lord you knew this service and whether it would be oh God and even who would listen father so whoever is listening in this evening father may they be blessed Lord in such a special way in Jesus name I pray amen amen praise the Lord are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen take your Bibles to the Book of Ruth chapter we will first uh read the last portion which we which we left out in chapter one on Sunday uh we read chapter 1 verse 19 and then we will read the we'll go on to chapter two praise the Lord uh chapter 1 verse 19 says so are we all there if you're there Say Amen Okay so The Book of Ruth is after judges and before first Samuel so I'd like us to first read that portion which we left out from verses 19. so so so they too went until they came to Bethlehem and it came to pass when they were calm to Bethlehem that all the city was moved uh was moved up about them and they said is this Naomi and she said unto them call me not Naomi call me Mara for the almighty has dealt very bitterly with me I went out full and the Lord has brought me home again empty why then call ye me Naomi saying that the Lord has testified against me and the almighty has Afflicted me with her which returned out of the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of Bali Harvest so I'd like us now to go on on to chapter two so the person we have now read is a after we have seen a decision of Ruth after Ruth made a decision then now what came next was them to start to take the journey to to the land of Israel or to Bethlehem so when they arrived in Bethlehem then now Naomi did not want to be called Naomi anymore because according to how God had Justified against her and so she said call me Mara for the Lord has testified against me now I would like us to uh introduce something else today in chapter 2. let us read beginning with verse 1. and Naomi had had the king's man of her husband a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was Boaz and Ruth the moabites said unto Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find Grace and she said that to her go my daughter and she went you see I love one thing I love about Ruth is that Ruth was a woman of Revelation Ruth many things were being revealed to her even before Naomi really told her and uh and uh we know that brother Burnham types Naomi as the Old Testament or as the old Orthodox Jewish church and and Ruth as the New Testament the bride and and see so the bride there is something not about the bride of Christ that she has Revelation can we say Amen to that and so I'd like us to look at verse 3 and she went and came and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and her harp was to to was too light to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz who was on the Kindred of early marriage and behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord blessed thee then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the Reapers whose damso is this and the servant that was set over his Reapers answered and said it is the more brightest damso that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab and she said I pray you let me green and gather after the Reapers among the shields so she came and has continued even from the morning until now that the that she tarried a little in the house can the deacons please help verse 8 then said Boaz unto Ruth here is thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hands but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them have I not charged the young man have I not charged the young man that they shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes but thou should stick thou knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger and Boaz answered and said unto her it has fully been showed me all that thou has done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and they land of thy Nativity and had come unto a people which thou knowest not here here to fall the Lord recompersed thy Work and a full reward be given thee for the Lord God of Israel and under whose wings Thou Art come to trust did you look at that verse 12 when you give up everything for the sake of the Lord he recompenses you and he rewards you those are two different things he recompenses all your time all that you lost he decompenses for all that you did for all that you sacrificed for all that you lost he recompenses you and then he rewards you and see so when Boaz came he was very he was he was he was not in the dark about what this woman Ruth had sacrificed knew everything about Ruth and so he now began to tell her because of what you have done may the Lord recompense you for a full reward okay let us go on we shall read up to verse 18. verse 13 now then she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord for that thou has comforted me and for that thou has spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens and by what say down to her at Meal Time Come Thou hither and eat of the bread and deep thy muscle in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers and he reap he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was surfaced and left and when she was reason up to Green but was commanded his younger men saying let her glean even among their sheaves and reproach her not now remember this is an outsider she's not even a Jew she's not even an Israelite she's from outside and now she has come to glean among among the Jews but you see the eye of bawas quota quickly and they began to make friends and he even invited her to come on his table and eat together can you imagine that fast if you have found favor before God I'm saying if you have had the message and you have believed the message then you found favor before God and God has brought you to come and be right there Amen on the table on the high table and sup together with him it's a blessing verse 15 and when she was risen up to Green Boaz commanded his younger men saying let her green even among the sheaves and reproach her not and let let fall also some of the handfuls of of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not so she gleaned in the field until evening and and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an F an effer of Bali and she took it up and went into the City and her mother-in-law saw that what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed let us speak to the Lord a moment father we have just read a portion of This Book of Ruth once again this is your holy inspired word it was written for our example and now Lord I pray that you will come and give us the same inspiration Lord today that your people may be blessed there are not many books in the Bible that are titled by the name of a woman just a few and Ruth happens to be one of them Lord I know that this book of Ruth speaks of you of the Bride of Jesus Christ in this time so while we go through this book and study a few things here and there and go through it Lord father no doubt will not be able to cover everything but whatever the holy spirit will lead us to touch on and may it be a blessing to your people father is my prayer in Jesus name amen amen you may have your seats I was just thinking about that song Let us sing that chorus as we we get into the word that God should love I say should love to sorrow into please [Music] let us sing it again the first one stanza that God foreign [Music] to change my sorrow into Bliss Norris [Music] ready I plan to bring me now how wonderful his life [Music] sing it outside oh yeah [Music] such as [Music] freely in the skin [Music] although it meant his death on Calvary what it is [Music] Hallelujah sing it outside [Music] [Music] I wonder is love like peaceful how we out cause such as [Music] blind the Savior played under diary Redemption 4. our worthless oh yes think about his love for you brother sister oh yes the wonderful is love amen and now he takes you and now he takes me to his heart of sun oh he asks me not well to take a servants please will the fire of country wanderings all the time amen wide open eyes oh yes Lord thank you for your love Lord Jesus thank you for loving us Lord oh yes Lord Jesus Oh Hallelujah my God how wonderful is Love Like Me are you not thankful of his love amen amen God bless you now I was thinking about Ruth the more by it is Ruth the more bites was a woman that truly can sing the song that we have sung because Ruth the moabites was not a Jew and therefore she was not in the original plan and and the way that God had planned these things out but Ruth because of God is Grace Ruth was loved and Ruth was highly favored and Ruth was chosen and Ruth but did you know even if Ruth was chosen Ruth was loved Ruth was favored Ruth was predestinated but it had to take Ruth to make a decision just like us today it has to make to take us to make a decision tell your neighbor you have to take and make a decision tell them you have to make a decision amen praise the name of the Lord why don't your brothers come this side so I look One Direction now friends so today I'd like to talk the second part of this and I'd like to call it Ruth the more about his serving or Ruth serving now I'll begin with that quote from the kinsman redeemer whereby the Barnum said I read it on Sunday I'll read it one more time he said I want to approach it from four different phases Ruth I got it right here Ruth deciding Ruth making a decision Ruth serving Ruth resting and Ruth rewarded as we come back Ruth making the decision Ruth after she made our decision Ruth then Ruth serving then Ruth is resting then Ruth is rewarded let me tell you whether whether you feel it or not you like it or not all of us are going through these four stages everyone that is called of God must go through these four stages I must go through them you must go through them because Ruth is a type of the Gentile bride the gentle church and Ruth goes through four stages when she was called by God and the very first stage is what we covered on Sunday about Ruth making at this her decision and so today I'd like us to cover the second Ruth serving now there is uh here's something and and as I promised you through this subject I'll do a lot of quotes and I would like you to follow me brother if there is a brother if you can put them on the screen and that would be not nice that's what Ruth had to do she had to make sure to come from her own over to another people I was supposed to read this on Sunday but I did not she was converted she made a decision Ruth was converted she made a decision everyone that comes to the Lord must be converted and must make a decision let me ask you a question why do we need to be converted to begin with if we were born perfect we don't need to be converted if we if you were born in a perfect way and that that you know there's some people who say I don't need to repent I don't need to be saved because I have nothing to be saved from they think that someone who repents is someone who has murdered some people they think that someone who repents is or needs someone that needs conversion is a person who smokes who does bad things out there or or who does adultery or fornication but like that younger Rich ruler that younger boy by the way was was as perfect as perfect as we can feel or we can as perfect can be because if you want to look at Perfection brother and you ask me what is the definition of perfection most of us think that a definition of perfection is when someone has never done anything bad right you have never sinned according to us sin is the wrong actions that we do therefore if someone lies tells lies if if I ask you who has never told a lie you lift up your hand who was never stolen something you lift up your hand who has never you know committed fornication lift up your hand who has never done this and that you lift up your hand then it means all of you who have lifted up your hands according to what we think is perfection you are perfect but according to God the definition of perfection is not that we are not perfect because we have not done wrong actions we are perfect because we have accepted the the sacrifice which was given on the cross for us we are perfect because we have accepted amen we have made a decision to be converted because we are born in a perverted way therefore we need to be converted to the perfect way are you following me all of us who were born in sin we were born in sin and because of the listen listen because of the way we were born that's the reason why we need to be converted not because of the things we did when we got born no but we we need to be converted because we were born did you hear that brother Joseph did you hear that you need to be converted because you were born can you imagine some people said oh God is not fair how come that because I was born I need to be converted because you were born in a perverted way and you that we were born in a way of sin we were born in a way of the according to the lust of the Flesh and therefore we need to be born again according not to the lust of the flesh but according to the word of God it's the word of God that makes you and me perfect and when he says that we should be perfect even as god is perfect it means we should be converted into the nature of Jesus Christ and so here Ruth made a decision and I wanted to bring your thoughts together and really follow me tonight and I think it will be better without an interpreter today so that I can cover everything I needed to cover because when we have an interpretation we take longer so if you listen to me and and then we will be able to go faster so listen here it says and you make a decision you got to you God to take your choice you want to go back to the things of the world or you want to go on with God you see it's a decision that we make do you want to go back to the things of the world or you want to go on with God I ask you also today do you want to go on with God or you want to take on to go back to the things of the world what do you want to do say what you want to do you see I want to go on with God and you know when we when we hear oh I want to go on with God many times we think oh going on with God is easy he's better no going on with God we are going to see tonight is the harder way it's not the easy way out it's the other way out but it is a decision that every believer must make in order to please God and go into the Rapture so here he says do you want to act like the world and the rest of them then kiss Christ and say goodbye and go back but if you want to take you away with the Lord is despised the few hold on to God his unchanging hand amen regardless of what the rest of the world says you hold right there God said so it is true I believe it do I have anybody that believes it here today though I can't make it manifest in my life God said so I believe it oh I hold right here and by the way this is the attitude of every believer even when I cannot make some things manifest in my life even when certain things are still very hard for me to achieve and to attain spiritually speaking but I will hold right here I will not give up I will not go back to the world I will not give up I will stay right here in the world because I've made up my mind I've met my choice I'm going to stand right here in the world amen praise the name of the Lord and here some of you promised me that you'll listen to the message the king's man Redeemer how many listen to it raise up your hand still okay two all right those of you who did not listen to it you did not keep your promise so please go back and listen to it tonight because again I'll ask you when I come back to minister so please go and listen to that message I know we might have been busy but create some time for the Lord because if you listen to it and we go through it oh man you just enjoy it so very much so I want you to hear this quote again it says you see I want us to look a little bit on the Journey of Ruth he says she said I will go clean cut decision I will go clean cut okay see this sure would you go I'm not sure let me tell you God does not like mediocre's God likes you see by the band I'm told his son Billy Paul he said if you're going to be anything be the best if you're going to be a bum be the best bum in the world you see if you're going to be a gangster be the best gangster if you're going to be a Christian be the best Christian if you can't if you if you be a Christian and you're not the best Christian you are only robbing your time not God this time you're robbing your time so but if you are going to be a Christian be the best Christian don't be in the middle don't be cold or don't be lukewarm cold not cold not hot but God is looking for people who are hot who are on fire for him who are who are living everything else and making like he said here a clean cut decision quickly mad she could have to eat that's what Ruth did and Alpa went back let me tell you in this journey that we are taking this journey of salvation and like I said it's not an easy Journey even since I started this journey many years ago there have been many we started with and many left it because it was not easy for them they made up their decision to turn back but we kept marching forward is that right brother martin we kept has it been easy for us no has it been a Bed of Roses no how many when you believed how many believed with you and and and and are still with you many of them turned back many of them turned back so it's not for the faint-hearted it's not for the weak and the lazy it is for those that are going to make a clean cut decision when you make a clinical decision and You Begin this journey my friend you have begun a war it's not just a journey it is a war him and this journey of following Jesus Christ and believing the word is not easy it is hard because you are making a bunch of sacrifices you are making many sacrifices that are not going to make you popular you are making sacrifices that are going to make you look as if you were an oddball the amen before even others but when you make that decision you make a clean cut quick decision say I'm not going to go back and he says the journeyed on Ruth in our heart not knowing where she was going can you imagine how many of you know heaven or have you ever we don't know where we are going we don't know heaven we have never been there before but in our soul something tells us amen that that land is good that land is Flowing with milk and honey and we we have never seen it without physical eyes but yet we believe that land is there amen and I know one day I'm going to get into that land Hallelujah and I know that one day these things of the world is going to seem like nothing the suffering of the world is going to seem like nothing the needs and the ones and the things that have been putting me here and there amen one day I will wake up one morning and I will no longer be in this body because all these things will be nothing when I have finally overcome amen and Ruth was going to a land I'm imagining she might have sang that song that song There is a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see the fire grow up she had never gone beyond the board of Moab but here she was amen telling uh telling Naomi I am leaving all my people I am leaving all my land I'm leaving behind my culture I'm leaving behind my tribe I'm leaving behind my friends I'm leaving behind everything I ever knew to the land I have never been to it is the same thing that we believe I should do hallelujah amen brother Dixon before God is looking for a people that are going to keep marching forward are people that do not look back friends let us not look back we have gone through why would you look back now you see Ruth he says the prophet says she they journeyed on and Ruth in her heart not knowing where she was going but a type of the church we saw John like Abraham we are pilgrims in a Strange Land Among Us strange people and on she went and finally she came into the room that had the place where Naomi was bringing her and what did she find everybody parting her on the back and saying Ruth we are glad to have you down here was that the case was that the case I'm asking you Hallelujah that everybody came and when Ruth arrived with the when when Ruth arrived with the what was her name with Naomi and then when they reached what's the name of the place when they reached this place don't think that everybody was parting her on their back and said oh Ruth Naomi oh we are happy to have you here please come and have a cup of tea you think this is how it was you think that's how it was that because she was from there and now when she came back to the land of bed today to to Bethlehem everybody was patting her on the back and welcoming and oh kissing I said oh oh now Ruth you're welcome to Bethlehem you wanted to be like that but that's not how it was yeah it's the prophet saying that by the way it's not me listen to what he says what Mecca immediately a great woman no the first thing Ruth made was to decide to make a right decision then the second thing that Ruth did amen was to serve don't expect to be a king without serving for you to be a king you have to first serve God help us and here the Christian Life he says those preachers they tell you that the Christian Life is a flower a bed of ease whoever says that he says he's either deceiving you oh he has never accepted that experience himself the world hurts you and the people will help will help will help you you've got to take the way of the Lord is despite the few and you have to be laughed at amen does somebody believe this you ought to be made fun of or anything else you have got to be different you are born of another Nation we are Christians from above and here brother now gives a story of him and his wife and how they were talking and he says my wife and I uh are quoted against it seems it seems so well to do it my wife asked me he said why don't the Christian women wear those clothes like the other women do meaning short skirts mini skirts trousers and things like that conditions people not from Uganda they can't they will not understand what I mean by kundi shows but here we know conditions Barca shows and stuff like that you see why don't the Christian women wear those things clothes like the other women and then I said we are all I'm um she said we are all Americans aren't we and brother Barnum said no sir and then she said well what are we but abandon said we are neither Germans we are not French we are not belgiums we are not Swiss we are not African we are not Americans or none of them and then she said but what are we and I said we are Christians Americans act like Americans German acts like a German because it's their National Spirit Are You Gonna Act Like A Uganda because it's hard National Spirit but we have a national Spirit also as Christians and that is the holy spirit coming from God out of heaven and you act like that it makes you conduct yourself as you they do up there because you are one you are of another world that's why even these things of of jesting you know what Justin is Justine you know those things they do it in the world it is common it's normal it is the way you enjoy life you know with your friends you know you you just gist and you joke around and you laugh you you throw another joke you laugh about it did you know that that's the spirit of this world did you not Believers should not do that did you know that the Bible says that a Believer is going to give an account of every what they speak did you know that so you see because we are of another world we should catch another Spirit from the world where we are going amen and the spirit from where the world the spirit of the of the world where we are going is the Holy Spirit and that's what I believe I should cash a Believer must catch him in that Holy Ghost that's why we are preaching the Holy Spirit evident service friends if you don't receive the Holy Spirit you have lost it all you have lost it all you may know the whole Bible in your head it might be packed there but until you receive that power the power of God the power of the Holy Ghost that shakes you up and changes you and converts you then you have not reached at all you have to receive that then it will change your mind and then you will be a complete completely different man here he says we are living in America that's true that's the body part but the soul that's called that conducts us our character is from above we live from above because we are born from above all Christians come from above are you hearing this do you believe it amen as I'm reading it you might as well say Amen Jesus said I am not from below I am from above if I was from below my subjects would fight for me but my kingdom is of above so is every man that's born of the kingdom of God he is from above hey man can you shout and say I am from above Hallelujah now when we were born we were born with many things around us that we need to change we may not have the power to change it but we need to yield ourselves to be adjusted as I'm going to show you here Ruth how to adjust herself you see the prophet says now watching now as we go on we find them coming into the into disappointment is that where you come into when you got the Holy Spirit sure did I did making fun of and everything that then notice life was hard for her and it's hard after you become a Christian even I want to say when someone you know is drunk of the Holy Spirit maybe we are in a service like this and someone and then maybe we are worshiping or singing you know and someone is drunk of the Holy Ghost maybe they're staggering around or falling around or shouting and then you begin to see people turning their necks and then in Surprise and in shock they look at that person that's a very clear sign that that person has not received that experience because if they had that experience they would be acting the same way that person is acting am I preaching to Believers today but he said when you receive the Holy Spirit you will be made fun of when you receive the Holy Spirit you'll be made fan of and everything and then he says notice life was hard for her meaning Ruth and it is hard after you become a Christian when you become a Christian let me say this when you become a Believer life becomes hard for you when you become a Believer it doesn't become easy it becomes hard when you receive the Holy Ghost life becomes hard it doesn't become easy it becomes harder because you got to adjust yourself from one life of gaiety and pleasures of the world to another life of consecration to God have you heard that you see you have got to adjust yourself from a life of gayity you know get here means you know you know fun a life of fun you know a Mary Being Mary or being cheerful you know the people of the world that's all they want to have deity you know cheerfulness they want to be cheerful that they want to be and you know for them they don't have the joy listen listen to me Church listen to me they don't have the joy of the Lord so you know the joy of the Lord comes from the inside of your heart sometimes when you are singing you even feel like shouting and laughing how many have you ever felt that you see when when the word of God is going on or when the word of God is being preached or something like that you've just feel so joyful in your heart and you feel like laughing and and you know it has happened to me many times you know I'm worshiping and I just laugh and laugh and laugh why because I'm joyful in my heart hallelujah or maybe when I'm greeting one brother you know I'm just laughing all the time oh God bless you my brother and I'm smiling all the way you know the people of the world will translate that to mean that you have a lot of money right because for them they are only joyful when they have something of the material wealth but a believer has Joy from the heart Joy from the soul and our that Joy let me tell you you should never let anything take away that Joy because that Joy is the believer's strength when the moment you reach when you feel you have no joy my brother go to prayer because you need that joy to be revived every minute of your life but when that Joy leaves you you know it left you know it left David one time but it left David because David had sinned and he had he had murdered and he had a committed adultery and that's why that Joy left so he went you see the spirit of God never left really because if you're still with the Holy Ghost no matter what you do the Holy Ghost does not leave but you see what left him was the joy of Salvation and he came before the Lord and he said oh God restore the joy of my salvation and you see when he prayed God restored it and he was joyful again are you hearing me so the believer has Joy from within that Joy comes from your soul no sickness can take it away no sin can take it nothing can take it away that Joy should be in there but when you get into things then Briars and then it takes that away when you go into prayer God restores that way because that Joy is your strength and then notice the people of the world don't have that instead the devil gives them things to to spike them and bring them something which looks like the joy of the Lord so the devil gives them Bang weed cigarettes alcohol what else fornication money gambling come on movies come on huh football and things that will give you Joy but for a moment it is it looks like Joy but it is for a moment it wears off quickly says a Believer when you come to the Lord it is hard to be a Christian because you have to adjust yourself from one life of gaity and pleasures of the world you have to add you must adjust yourself you have to adjust yourself from that to another life so it's not all Dandy and wonderful because it's a battle you have battling to to to to to to adjust yourself from that kind of thing you see you have to address yourself from that kind of Lifestyle to another life of consecration to God you have got to realize just yourself over into this other side so don't think it was easy for Ruth Hallelujah it was not easy for Ruth when Ruth had to re-adjust herself from this life to another life and Ruth had to adjust herself from being in a land where plenty where there was plenty to eat and everything respected to our people that was laughing making fun of her into a land she gleaned in the field for what she ate put it in her scarf and take it home and beat it out and make some bread and her and her mother did it imagine I wanted to imagine but they can put that off imagine that Ruth she came from a land where she had everything food was done you know they were very happy and initially before the feminist struck and and actually that's the reason even why now me and uh and who else and El mileage and his family they left Bethlehem to go to the land of MOA because there was enough food plenty so look when they went down there they found everything they needed so Ruth was used to a life of gaity Ruth was used to a life of Pleasures Ruth was used to a life you know I mean to be your question is Ruth was used to that kind of Pleasures a life of yeah you know hype hype hype kind of life and but now it was a time for her amen the prophet says she had to adjust from that kind of life to another kind of life and that is not an entirely Pleasant thing it is something filled with self-denial it is something filled with the sacrifices it is something filled with sometimes even sadness because it is as if you're losing in order to attain something new but I tell you as a Believer every believer must experience that when you feel you are adjusting from this to that it is not easy but you have to serve God amen every boy your girl brother sister man or woman that comes to the Lord must serve God but you can't serve god without adjusting yourself you have to faster the just yourself all right we'll carry on here and he says and Ruth how to adjust herself from being in a land where plenty okay I just read that for you all right I'll go on down here it says when she was there they come to find out while she was gleaning or going to Green now she made a decision that was her deciding now the next thing that she was to do is to serve and that's the church and that's what the church has to do the church after making your decision you have to serve tell somebody you have to serve serve God according to his diagram listen serve God according to his diagram according to his blueprint you must serve God Ruth making the decision now Ruth serving and her decision now watch just a minute now she goes into the field to Green now you must serve God tell somebody you must serve God one more time you must serve God this should be according to his blueprint not according to your desires not according to your am I preaching to somebody not according to your cravings not according to your wants but according to the blueprint you must serve God and a servant obeys the master regardless of the conditions the master sets for you you obey a servant each of us is the servant each of us must be a servant of God not only the preachers or the ones who are on the pulpit are servants every believer in the body is a servant must be a servant of God both woman and man we all must serve just like Ruth served you represent each of us we represent the entire Christian Nation remember our nation is of above and our spirit must be the Holy Spirit and therefore we must all serve under that blueprint which is the word of God that that God has given to us in our time in a message says we would see Jesus and I don't believe that there is anybody that has ever at any time ever heard or read of Jesus but what would long to see him I am sure that we would it will be our desire the desire of every heart of Christianity to see the Lord Jesus that's why we live by that's why we lay aside everything to try to live so that we will be able to see him someday but I wonder if the scriptures plainly say that he is the same yesterday than forever then why can't we see him today I will say the reason why we don't see him today is because we many people want to see him but they are not willing to labor and wait we are not willing to labor in prayer we are not willing to labor in fasting we are not willing to live but we just want a life of deity and you know joy and happiness but this joy that the world gives but you know God Jesus Christ also has the joy he gives and the joy he gives is permanent friend if you accept the joy that amen this word gives you let me tell you one time try it out if you feel sad try to enter into prayer and fasting if you feel like lonely try to identifying and prayer and then all of a sudden you'll feel God is giving you Joy and speakable and full of glory and you want to sing songs and you want to Rejoice why because amen amen there is a fasting within you a fasting to serve God assassin to live for him but you see the devil takes that fast many times and you he wants to satisfy it with the things of the world but if you can be able to take that fast and be satisfied with the things of God then that will be a permanent a permanent Joy now in talking about servant or being servants and how Ruth served I cannot finish without talking about this quality and the message the territorian church age where the Prophet explains very powerful points and as I go through them brother you find out for me so you can put it for the people and as I read it I wanted to follow closely very very powerful points there he says in those dark and Dreadful years the True Vine held its love for God and the love of the Brethren and I want to say in the dark and the Dreadful time when you are in your darker moments are you hearing me when you're in your dark moments in your low moments there is one thing that should not leave you the love for God and the love for the brethren see and he says I know your service Jesus said he that is the greatest of all is servant to all a wise man commented on that saying here is what he said only history will prove the truth of that dictum that man that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sow to always be at the head have gone down in shame and I will repeat that for the interest of those who might have missed it he says all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in Shem who was the according to you who was the greatest man on Earth that has ever been born by a woman raise up your hand and tell her tell us who was the greatest man on Earth yes my sister Hitler okay Hitler was according to the eye to many he was a great man right but the question is who was it the greatest of all that was ever that ever lived on earth yes Jesus he said Jesus but you are saying it with the full of Shem do you believe it say it like you believe it all right now listen friends Jesus I would also agree with you my brother that he was the greatest man that ever lived on earth now do you realize that Jesus knelt down and watch the Disciples of it have you ever thought about that Jesus was a servant and he says now sister where did Hitler go where is he now he went down in shame every man because Hitler was one of those that wanted to be served that were oppressing those that were that demanded to be served and those that you know wanted always to be the head they went down in Shem that's why if you want to see a great leader you will always see them serving great leaders serve great people serve and I want to say great Christians serve you see it is always say that even the church for example that people who clean the church should be the poor ones Among Us but that's a very poor mentality of anybody who has ever had it I remember in growing up and you know as a young man in the church together with the others that we grew up with we were always the one cleaning the church not because we had nothing to do we were students and we were busy but you see you would always come and make sure we come earlier than everybody else and we clean the church thoroughly we clean the pulpit area we clean everywhere and we make sure that by the time others come everything is perfect that is serving so I believe that every believer you know must be a servant every believer must be a servant you know it's not only those who have nothing or who have lit of this world these things that should be servants that should be the ones to serve you you know that you are the big one or because you have more money there's nothing like that in the Kingdom of God in the Kingdom where I come from Amen in the Kingdom of Christians all of us are servants must be servants we all must be servants you see and he says all those who demand it to be served they who were oppressed they who sought to they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in shame even when the very rich are condemned by God when they have not used their wealth rights can you imagine even the very rich when you are rich and you have not used your money in the right way as a Believer you are condemned by God but look into history and you will find out that that truly the great where those who served others can you say Amen to that history can never Acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others Hallelujah he history does not say oh brother so also received a lot from history whatever it is in the Bible yet you will always see about amen names of those who did something for somebody else here we are reading about Ruth what did Ruth do Ruth went and green in a field of a stranger rules when she reached the Bethlehem she didn't you know sleep in her mother in law's house and said well at least we have a room where we can sleep let us just see hey you know sleep here in our language you said foreign looking for me no him and Ruth went out there in the garden in the field where the poor servants were gleading and she said let me clean something here for me and for you mother-in-law great people serve Hallelujah amen Esther was another great woman amen Esther did not just lie there amen after all I'm a Queen's wife nobody will touch me for you you can die but for me I am favored I am blessed by God I am highly favored for you you can die there for me I will not die but when Ruth when Esther had it in her ears you said what they are going to kill my people no no no no no no I am a servant of my people and therefore even if I am a queen I don't care about that I am going to fast for three days and three nights for my people the queen herself she became a servant she didn't say because I'm a queen and I'm loved by my by my husband remove that brother and I'm loved by my husband I know that everything is well you know what did she do she said let me let me fast for three days and then I go before my husband she knew it wasn't about the fasting rather it wasn't about her being the queen it was about her serving serving in prayer serving in fasting so she went there the women fasted for three days prayed for three days and then came boldly before the king amen why do we boldly go before the king because we have been serving him let me tell you that man who was going to die I don't remember his name the king who was going to die what was his name that the prophet had told that you have only a limited time it was Hezekiah and and you know what what hindered God from killing him was a life of service you see he reminded God everything he had done for him he said oh my God how come you're going to kill me now because she will remember everything I've done for you I've done a ABC before you have served I've served you all my life I've been he said okay now I'll add you some more time praise the name of the Lord if you serve God my friend Hallelujah you are going to be on the book on the on the right side of the book of books of God why because you are a servant Hallelujah Ruth was a servant amen I don't know you know how a man how a woman can sit in the church being a part of the body of Christ and you have never seen or found or had the desire to do anything in the in the house of the Lord how possible can that be you know if you're a member of the body of Christ amen you should always yawn to be an active member of the body what can I do Brethren what can I do you try to make yourself useful you try to find and see what am I doing what am I doing to Father the kingdom of God but I'm said if you can't go out there to preach send someone how do you send someone by giving them money even if you don't have so much time to go out there and preach then or then you know take out of what you have worked and then give somebody else who can go and then let them go and preach the gospel but you see every one of us should be an active member of the body of Christ Brothers young men you can't just sit in the church try to find something go on the on the streets and preach if you can't if you are not gifted to do that you can come down in the church and kneel and pray for the ones who are going if you can't do that unless you bring somebody to church do something make yourself busy you know come and try to learn the instruments if you can't learn the instruments come and interpret if you can't repeat come and preach if you can't preach find something clean the church at least but do something by all means by every means find yourself as a servant you can't be you know you can't be a dead part of the body you know if one of the if the one of the parts of the body is not working it is called a dead part and I don't want to be a dead part I want to be a useful part in the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the body of Jesus Christ like I said is worldwide Hallelujah me whenever whatever I find myself and let me tell you I've always told people I love I've traveled I've traveled quite a bit but wherever I go I don't care I don't say that this is not my jurisdiction you know like lawyers and and courts they have a place where they have laws that they cannot uh you know touch they said no no I don't have the mandate to do that my they call it the you know the court does not have the jurisdiction to handle a certain case or something like that but to a Believer as long as you're a member of the body of Jesus Christ wherever you are you're a servant and find yourself useful you see brother martin because you're a dick on here brother Mulan you're a dick on here don't say now when you go to kamuri you know and you are there for a Sunday you have to you know it's go and hide somewhere in the corner no brother you are you can't make yourself useful you you are you are you are a deacon in the body of Christ therefore be that try and you know do something do something even serve serve you know I remember I went to China China you know I was like wondering my brother was telling me you have to stick with me be with me because now this is not an easy country and what I told myself how can I come in China and just to stick to myself and just stick to my unbelieving brother he said I should be out there and I serve I should be a servant I should I do what I know how to do I should evangelize and you know what I did they have an app called WeChat these Chinese don't know English most of them so most of them use Chinese so I had to find a way to talk to them so I found I downloaded that app I install it on my phone and whoever I was meeting you know you just stand like this and then you begin talking there's a way you do it and then they give you their whatever so now we begin talking with them and then of course I begin with what they're doing and then I ask them about Jesus Christ do you know about Jesus Christ and and I really I preached the seven of them and I know one of the if I don't meet them in a Rapture I'll meet them on a day of judgment surely I will tell them I told you restaurant workers and people who are very open-minded you know they find you working and they say let us have a picture together and so I said okay let's share now also contact let us talk on WeChat so I begin preaching to them but many of them would tell me oh me I believe in money or me I believe in myself or me you know they don't even believe in God at all I said oh God have mercy but friends I want to tell you this that even then at least I made myself useful we must find you know when I travel even to cities or to wherever many times when I'm in Nairobi what I do I travel with these trucks you know and I give it to somebody I share I give to somebody I give to somebody you know I give somebody a tract you know make yourself useful I was working with a brother one time he said we went into a bank and uh and I had my like a few tracks I I I I I I was served after I was served then I handed the the lady attract so I think it was about on baptism or godhead so the brother said ah so even in the back you're evangelizing I said Hallelujah brother you you got it brother sister let us evangelize let us amen serve God everywhere we are let us do something for let us have a burden for the word let us have a burden Amen to be useful in the body of Jesus Christ you can't be a stagnant part of the body be a useful part of the body do something where your place wherever you are come on do something amen be moved amen your life you are risking your life Hallelujah do something do something we have to be oh my God help me I don't want to dwell so much on this but something's putting me to say more on this we can't be whether you're a sister or a brother sisters you have even more work to do you have more work to do even by living the life of Jesus Christ by living a life of character you're preaching to thousands out there you know you can go down there and pray pray for your husband pray for your home pray for the church pray let me tell you the church cannot move without prayer the church cannot even progress without people men and women praying and fasting there has to be praying and fasting they have to be the Zeal there has to be that desire within men and women of God to see things happening in the church and that can't happen without people serving and how do you solve by being on you know on Zeal by being on fire you know when you see someone you know someone is becoming weak and don't just begin talking against them and you know spoiling and you know taking the whole thing around and telling the oh do you know Brother Sam says like that no brother when you see something like it should take you before God you know that's how a servant Acts Hallelujah let us do something you see even the rich are condemned even if you have your money it is your money but you are condemned if you don't use it right but look into history you see you'll find that they're truly great where those who served others history can never Acclaim those who for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others now let us apply that to ourselves even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet for the apostles and washes their tired and that defeat he said you don't know now what I am doing but you will know Hereafter but what you see me doing you ought also to do let us watch one another's Feet friends let us serve one another he became a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights and one day in the Judgment of the Saints we are going to hear him say Well done good and faithful Lord now well done good and faithful servants Hallelujah so if you served God by praying if you serve God by song reading if you serve God by you know handling cleaning the church or playing instruments or interpreting or preaching or evangelizing if you serve God by bringing somebody to church by witnessing if you serve the god like that one day you are going to hear that voice in your ears well done my good and faithful servant Hallelujah that's what he's saying here and I believe that's how it will obey well done my good and faithful servant it is hard to be always a servant it is hard not easy it is hard but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be worth it all then let us labor for the master from this done till Setting Sun let us talk of all his wondrous love and care and when all of life is over and our work on Earth is done and the role is Called Up Yonder I will be eternal life do you know what it will be for you if some brother or sister comes to you with need and you have your own program and you have your money and you tell them brother I'll pray for you do you know what it will be on that day for you you have withheld your hand from service you see the Bible says this is even the Bible talks about it say brother comes to you you he's in need and you have something and you just tell him brother they failed God bless you God you know increase you and instead of reaching your pocket and giving him to him that has need it's not always money it can be Comfort somebody can come to you for Comfort or maybe they need a Grace to overcome something they need prayer someone just send something on the WhatsApp group or maybe to use called you and says brother pray for me you say all right I'll pray and you don't pray and you don't pray see you withheld your hand from service but brother if someone says pray for me and maybe they have a need prayer for me brother take it serious you're a servant go down on your knees and pray even if it's for one minute pray for them that is the life of service you are giving your time your life is being spent for others you are doing it for others eternal life is living for others not living for ourselves or our own families but living for others God help us friends to be servants and one day why in the field Boaz will see you Hallelujah oh my when he reached there you know Naomi said uh Ruth said Naomi let me go in the field I want to serve I want to glean I want to go do something I don't want to just be here I want to go down there in the field and do something and and Naomi said all right you can't go my daughter and when she reached there she began you know you know gleaning whatever little she found it was not easy it was hard because there was so little left behind but you see how she was gleaning you know and then Boaz came Boaz is the master of the Harvest but what is the owner of the field this was but what is filled hey Hallelujah I want to say this Christian Journey this Christian field is filled Jesus Christ Our God by us amen hallelujah hallelujah and you see as this girl you know the little Ruth that she was there gleaning you know little by little corn little by little bo ask him and when Boaz came his eyes did not go anywhere his eyes landed on this little girl who was gleaning somewhere some little thing sometimes we may feel oh God my my effort is so little there are many others who can do much more than I it has it doesn't have to be me oh God even me what I do it's not recognized let me tell you God sees every little thing you do for him and for his bride Hallelujah God says it might be just clearing the church it might be just you know you know you know creating the sound there and maybe brother sometimes you are harassed by preachers then they tell you brother make the sound properly and then you are like oh they are not even appreciating me let me tell you God sees every little thing we do you see you might be you might be an interpreter and you interpret and you interpret and you interpret and you interpret and you feel like ah I'm getting sick and tired of this but I want to tell you brother I want to tell you amen that little thing you are doing you are not doing it for anybody else you are doing it for both you are serving and gleaning in the field of ours and one of these days just like it was with Ruth but what will come Hallelujah and his eyes will be right on you and he will say hallelujah who is that woman if the president came around here and said who is that one it means that he Hallelujah you have caught the attention of the president if you catch the attention of the president that means there is something good coming for you hahaha Hallelujah we can never serve for free if you serve in the field above us maybe if it is another field but if it is a field above us amen you can never serve in that field for nothing there is always a reward Hallelujah that's why true Servants of God don't serve for men to please to be many Pleasers I Don't Preach to please you amen that's why you know you don't come here to play instruments so we can pay you some amount of money oh they are doing it in the independecostal churches you find younger men yeah young men are moving around from church to church they can even they don't even listen to the word anymore there was Rob the name of that from a church this Sunday they are here dear they go to the highest bidas who pays them more money is where they will play that Sunday and all that Wednesday or whichever day I say here at dvf will never do it we will never do it in Jesus name we are not going to pay younger men to come here and play for us let the instruments be there if no one is going to play them I don't care they will be there but God must always raise servants Hallelujah this Pulpit is here we are not going to pay people to pay to for them to come and preach to us no we are not going to pay them amen this Pulpit is here God must send preachers Hallelujah that's why you see this church or any true amen church that is founded on the Bible amen is no it's never about the pastor it's never about the man there that man can go the church and the work of God remains because the work is the work above us it's not the Church of talamuala it's not the Church of somebody it's the charge of Jesus Christ he is our great mawas and this great Powers amen he keeps sending greenness he keeps sending greeners walk us into his field and when he sends them there what it does he pays them very well handsomely there is a reward for every servant somebody serving by praying somebody serving by preaching by interpreting somebody silent by cleaning somebody serving by you know being on the piano by being on the drums or whatever it is you're doing in the church or you are evangelizing out there or you are giving out a truck to somebody or you are praying or fasting for the church don't say oh Lord I'm the Holy One only no maybe God has given you that burden to fast and pray brother do it do it without memory doing it without thinking about others do it as a service to the kingdom and the body of the Lord Hallelujah and you will receive fears coming out of that you know it's all about service each of us is gifted and blessed with something that we can do and Ruth went there to serve and when when Boaz came he said who is that beautiful girl Hallelujah imagine Elizabeth if he were that Ruth oh you are Ruth yourself see ah who is that beautiful God she's she's walking in my field and and Boaz was asking who is that beautiful God and you know she was not just lazy sleeping in the church not saying a man because she's young she wasn't doing that she was in the church young but shouting amen you know you young girls but younger boys that are here I can see you looking at me that's very nice when you you come in the church here don't I don't even know why mothers and fathers make them sit behind there bring them to the front let them be here actually deacons help the mothers let all those younger children you know eight nine five you know from at least eight and above seven and above let them sit on the front rows let them always feel the heat of the word let them there let them goes from the I will assure you though not those when they are here they will not teach them to serve in the field this was a little girl Ruth Ruth was a little girl and she was in the field of Bowers and as she was gleaning there you know Boaz came and Boaz was not a married man that's the good part but was not a married man which means he was looking for a bride hey if you know you know he was looking for a bride and right there you know he looked and he died ah who is that beautiful God and somebody said it is the more bitrate Ruth the more about us the one that came with Naomi he said ah okay he said whenever you are green leave something for her so she can get something to take to her home Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you when you are serving God he will make sure I leave something for you Hallelujah you can never serve him for nothing whatever you do for the kingdom of God God will pay you up and he will pay you with enough and that payment is not all there is more coming there is a better reward coming we know where we are going we have a better reward coming but this is just the honest it's just a little bit of what of the bigger one that is coming he says leave us something whenever you are greeting leave for some leave for some live for Assam so you are walking in the line of your service as you are walking in the line of your service you are walking in the line of your blessing did you get a revelation oh my you you think you're on the camera or you're trying to stream the service brother Isaac but no you are serving God not meet God and he's the great boss and he says leave something for him leave something for that little girl and then one time God does not just come like these boys come these days I want to marry you uh he takes time he takes his time take your time brother I'm okay those who have known it I've known it so I'll pass that and so when he reaches here he says now now cheers he comes both himself to this girl himself now he comes to this guy and this guy was like oh I'm even shy that I fall in favor in your sight that you yourself could come down to me yes he says no it's all right I would like you actually to come and eat with me on my dining table said yes come and serve together with me you know what he says in the Bible he says that he says be separate he says that he wants to be our God and he wants us to be his children and he wants to serve together with us you see he wants to eat together with us that's what he did for us did with Ruth you know when when when when when you come in the line of service God does not only give you things or give you things that you need he doesn't provide all that you need but you also bring you he lifts you up from the position where you are and lifts you and blesses you on his own dining table to eat with the Royals do you know what it means to sit on the same table with the King imagine if you're sitting down on the same table with the King what does it mean it means you can never be the same again hallelujah hallelujah it means you can never be the same again if someone said that you sat on the same table with the King it means your life has changed permanently they may not see it yet but I'm telling your life has changed permanently and whenever you come to church here to sit down you are sitting on the same table dining table with a king because the king is dining with you through his wife Hallelujah that's why with good authority I can say you who listen to this message you can never be the same again because this message you know comes to amen amen change you completely change you completely and and this is exactly what happened with Ruth you know from that dining table do you know where else you went oh my God it's just so amazing just so amazing from that dining table the next place she went to was the feet of boys Hallelujah and we'll talk about that in the next service Ruth resting but before we talk about that resting part we'll leave that part and we'll talk about the resting part and then the reward part but here we're talking about Ruth serving Ruth was serving but you see the service was leading us somewhere you don't just come and God rewards you back from glory to glory but you want from glory to glory but you are not living you you it is a glory to glory to glory to glory it's not from grass to Grace like from grass to Glory it is from glory to glory to glory to glory God wants to lift you up but in stages don't outrun God some of us we want to outrun God you want to run faster than God imagine if Ruth had come and she said ah Master let me just sleep at your feet the Ruth would have said can you take away this silly girl take her out and throw her out what is what a nonsense girl this is she would have missed out but she had to take it slowly she had to follow the leadership of the king see yeah of Boaz rather he was the king he's our King so he's like okay now it's time for serving she said okay let me begin with the serving who knows I don't know what will happen I don't even have a husband I don't know but I've given all my chaos to him her concern was not of finding her husband she wasn't there you know maybe Boaz will see me let me put my boobs outside and then she prays up our breasts outside that that Boaz will see her nonsense she didn't do that she knew she needed a husband but she was not going to create a car she was going to do it in the right way whatever you need you need manner you need the husband you need a wife you don't know you don't need to do it the way of the world brother you don't need to do the way of the wild sister see follow the pattern follow the path and everything will be all right and see the next thing she did was to just to go and serve I said maybe she even went in in serving clothes I remember the first time I met my wife it was in a convention and it was dressed in mother's Union do you know mother's Union she was just in mother's Union and you know so I didn't even notice her because she was dressed in mother's Union so but you find these days younger people go to go conversions and they are spacing themselves up so that now brother can see me you know even they change they are working you know because because they have a wrong spit on them you see but once can say something like that right Mark when you say something like that you just look away because you know what you are looking for you see but you see when I imagine Ruth was there and maybe she was dressed in mother's Union also because she had gone to work A working woman is not a A Chorus girl but you Brothers you'll be there looking for chorus guys for a wife it is a shame see this brother was what this sister was dressed in a very I don't know in decent plus way I mean decent plus decent meaning she had overdressed because she had gone through the garden when you go to the Garden you don't dress to impress you dress to overdress because you are going to the Garden that's how she addressed but still she caught the eye of Boaz still she caught the eye about us and the boys were like ah who is that girl and the next thing she was being told come on a dining with me and still she would go even after she left the dining do you know that she went back to her mother in law still and she would come back to Glendale the following day she didn't say you know me I've been with the King therefore I will never clean again I'll never go to dig again ah what are you talking about even if you have been with the king so what you even if you have been with the King be yourself be yourself you know you'll be a place some people you want to live above Who We Are you fine you find people Brothers even some brothers do it because they want to impress girls they want to marry you find him renting a very good car yeah you find brother I don't know which brother should use this I don't want to get issues which brother should I use who is volunteering yeah brother Ivan I used you so you find brother Ivan renting renting a Mercedes-Benz and and you know or taking it from his brother and saying you say brother when I'm going to do something very important then I will come back and then he reaches there and then he you know he he you know closes the the car with a big bump so that they can know that he's done closing it and then he comes out you know working with his shoe which is like this and then you know try to and then you know they go there the restaurant then they begin to tell this sister you see the sister you see God has given us blessings and you know we are not working even at my age God has given me such a castle what do you think he will do for us when we get married but actually this brother is trying to increase his the place when he is still on the lower place you don't need to do that you need to be satisfied there are two things that the Bible says are great again I was talking about it with the brother today two things one one of them is godliness yeah godliness another one is contentment another one is what and he says godliness with the contentment is great gain Hallelujah if you want to gain greatness then my brother have godliness live for others live a Christian Life live simple and then be contented what has God given you in life be contented some people have one wife but they are not contented they want to get a second one you see that's why you they will always be in issues and then they have time for school fees comes they are scratching their head they're running all around because they have this wife this wife this wife this wife this wife why they were not contented and and some people you know God has given me clothes they're very nice clothes but you're not contented with them you want more you know someone God has given you a very slim body you are you know you are you you are you are you know you are portable you know but you want a very big body you're like oh God me I'm not contented with this I want more look now even maybe the other is looking at me because I'm very slim because I'm not only look at even in my bones look I'm not feeling happy about myself you are not contented you see another one is very fat God has given them a very fat body like who here [Music] so God has given a very big body
