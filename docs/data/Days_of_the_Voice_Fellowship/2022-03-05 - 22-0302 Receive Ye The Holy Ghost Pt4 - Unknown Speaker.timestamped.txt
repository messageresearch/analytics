[35:42] the blood was
[35:43] [Music]
[36:11] jesus died on the bride under the cross
[36:13] yes yes
[36:14] two thousand years ago
[36:20] messiah which was shed on the cross
[36:24] not here in a
[36:27] there is no church
[36:28] passing
[36:30] milliliters and liters of the blood of
[36:32] jesus
[36:36] that was that's the chemistry
[37:01] since we are doing a little teaching
[37:03] here let me go let me let's read that
[37:04] part here is
[37:25] let us first read the
[37:28] first read second corinthians chapter 5
[37:29] verse 19.
[37:36] [Music]
[37:37] quickly now
[37:38] the way that god was in christ
[37:40] reconciling the world unto himself not
[37:42] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[37:44] has committed unto us the word of
[37:45] reconciliation
[37:48] by the way
[38:09] second corinthians 5 9 yes
[38:12] 5 17 begin from 17
[38:15] therefore if any man be in christ she is
[38:18] a new creature all things are passed
[38:20] away behold all things have become new
[38:23] amon
[38:24] crystal
[38:31] and all things are out of god who has
[38:33] reconciled us to himself
[38:36] by jesus christ and has given to us the
[38:40] ministry of reconciliation
[38:46] [Music]
[39:04] [Music]
[39:09] [Music]
[39:24] there's quite many scriptures we can
[39:25] read but i
[39:26] think i will uh
[39:32] all right we can we could really join
[39:33] five but for stream five but i think we
[39:35] can skip that for now
[39:38] says
[39:42] okay you why don't you read first john 1
[39:44] 7.
[39:53] now yes
[40:07] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[40:09] cleanses us from all sin
[40:13] away
[40:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[40:18] then
[40:19] he says
[40:21] in revelation 1 5 and from jesus christ
[40:24] who is the faithful witness and the
[40:25] first begotten
[40:29] and the first begotten of the dead and
[40:31] the prince of the kings of the earth and
[40:33] to him that loved us and washed us from
[40:35] our sins in his own
[40:40] [Music]
[40:54] and that is why
[40:58] when we are in christ
[41:04] creature alien
[41:17] because we are under the ministry of
[41:19] reconciliation
[41:23] reconciliation
[41:25] to reconcile
[41:28] means to bring back to uh to bring
[41:31] together two parties
[41:59] [Music]
[42:04] amen what desire to bring us back
[42:06] together with him
[42:08] and come here
[42:10] because he said the soul that sinneth
[42:12] that soul shall die
[42:40] [Music]
[42:41] so what was jesus ministry
[42:44] his ministry what is that was the
[42:46] ministry of reconciliation
[42:49] shedding his blood on the ground
[42:53] which is shot on the cross
[43:36] my brother my sister listen carefully
[43:38] your full attention here
[43:45] [Music]
[43:50] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[44:07] yeah that's why i cannot have a cast on
[44:09] me
[44:11] more that's why you cannot take the cast
[44:12] of cynical no longer hold on your life
[44:17] are you following me
[44:19] what has it done
[44:34] us
[44:36] the meaning the word of god because
[44:39] jesus yes
[44:40] oh hallelujah somebody get it please
[44:43] amen when jesus came on the earth
[44:45] yesterday he came with the ministry of
[44:48] reconciliation
[45:02] so where is the blood atom
[45:04] the blood is in the world oversight
[45:08] amen
[45:10] he said father
[45:12] he sent me number one to man so saying
[45:17] hallelujah amen you sent me to do what
[45:19] one to my question is the ministry of
[45:20] reconciliation
[45:23] back to you
[45:25] but now i live negative
[45:29] i also give them
[45:44] amen amen that's why this gospel drips
[45:48] with blood
[45:51] whenever we are preaching
[45:54] this gospel
[45:55] is the blood of jesus christ
[46:09] hallelujah and then you are reconciled
[46:31] hallelujah amen
[46:33] now of course there were also other
[46:35] false prophets
[46:54] you

[47:08] done
[47:23] and things like that naming two names
[47:26] disorder in the church
[47:29] without interpretation
[47:32] they come with this without generio and
