[26:58] yeah I have something that I want us to
[27:01] share tonight

[27:06] charge attendance
[27:13] praise be to God
[27:16] Amen Amina the Bible tells us
[27:20] we should not forsake assembling
[27:22] together of saints
[27:27] as the manner of others
[27:31] amen Amina
[27:33] as we are seeing the days are
[27:35] approaching
[27:39] amen I mean
[27:41] so thank you for coming everybody in the
[27:44] presence of God
[27:46] that's what God always want us to do
[27:50] they expect us always to come in the
[27:53] service
[27:57] praise the Lord
[27:58] so I'm going to uh
[28:01] talk much about coming to church
[28:08] yeah you can call it attending church or
[28:10] church attendance
[28:14] we've read in Ezekiel
[28:18] Prophet Ezekiel is telling us something
[28:25] and where we read in Hebrews
[28:29] there is something uh like similar to
[28:32] what we have read in Ezekiel
[28:37] praise be to God
[28:41] Hebrews chapter 10.
[28:44] I wonder straight there again
[28:55] Hebrews 10 25.
[29:10] 23 says
[29:14] let us hold fast the profession of our
[29:18] faith
[29:22] without wavering because he is faithful
[29:26] that promise
[29:30] let us hold fast the profession of our
[29:34] faith
[29:38] Amina
[29:39] without wavering
[29:42] for he is faithful that promised
[29:47] you are here because you know that God
[29:50] who gave the promise in this world is
[29:52] faithful to keep it
[29:58] you are clinging to this promise for all
[30:01] these years because you are very sure
[30:03] that God is faithful
[30:17] [Music]
[30:22] what has kept you coming to church
[30:27] it is
[30:33] what has kept you as you're still coming
[30:35] to church it's because of that promise
[30:39] and you are attending you attending
[30:42] church
[30:45] that's where you refuel or you refresh
[30:48] your soul to continue in the battle
[30:52] [Music]
[30:56] blessed in the name of the Lord so there
[30:59] are things which have to hold the past
[31:01] that you are wavy into between
[31:06] and here Apostle Paul said in the
[31:08] letters hold fast the profession of our
[31:10] faith
[31:15] it's not just our faith
[31:18] this is the Faith of Christ
[31:22] blessed be the name of the Lord let us
[31:25] consider one another to provoke and to
[31:29] provoke and to love and to Good Works
[31:40] amen consider one another
[31:44] foreign
[32:06] [Music]
[32:54] who will be in the church bless you the
[32:57] name of the Lord and let us consider one
[32:59] another 25 says not forsaking the
[33:02] assembling of ourselves together
[33:07] [Music]
[33:10] as the manner of some
[33:14] Isa it is Bad Manners
[33:18] not to come for Fellowship
[33:21] blessed with the name of the Lord
[33:23] because when here the Bible is clearly
[33:26] telling us
[33:27] not forsaking assembling to get
[33:30] assembling ourselves together
[33:34] as the manner of some is
[33:37] it is but exhorting one another
[33:42] and so much the more as you see the days
[33:46] approaching
[33:52] the name of the Lord when we come and We
[33:55] Gather in the presence of God
[33:57] we are encouraging one another
[34:01] amen Apostle Paul says that when I'm out
[34:05] there
[34:06] I'm in the body
[34:08] blessed with the name of the Lord but
[34:11] when We Gather like this God brings this
[34:14] word
[34:17] to encourage us to correct us
[34:21] amen that's why we should always not
[34:24] forsake to assemble together
[34:28] as we are seeing the days are
[34:30] approaching
[34:32] we know the Lord is coming soon
[34:36] amen anytime anything any moment
[34:41] Jesus is
[34:46] because the Bible says that the bride
[34:49] has made ourselves ready
[34:52] we know there is a wedding which is
[34:55] going to take place
[34:57] and God is preparing us for that wedding
[35:01] he's walking on our government he's
[35:04] saying we come for service this time we
[35:07] come for Fellowship
[35:09] God's praying comes with the water of
[35:11] the world to cleanse us
[35:17] why it is written though uh that's why
[35:19] the Bible tells us
[35:22] amen that because iniquity shall abound
[35:25] the command
[35:27] the love of men shall works
[35:30] we'll be having form of godliness
[35:38] if we see it willingfully I don't know
[35:41] that we are received the knowledge of
[35:44] the truth
[35:46] they remain not sacrifice for sin
[35:50] because
[36:01] suddenly fearful looking for looking for
[36:04] of judgment and fair indignation we
[36:09] shall defer the adversaries
[36:13] [Music]
[36:18] [Music]
[36:20] praise the Lord
[36:26] amen Amina and if you go back to the
[36:30] scripture we read also in uh a second
[36:34] you see the son of man speak to the
[36:36] children of thy people
[36:41] amen God is telling the prophet
[36:44] to speak to his people
[36:48] and say unto them
[36:50] when I bring the sword upon the land
[36:55] if the people of the land take a man of
[36:58] their costs him
[37:06] for their Watchmen
[37:13] if when he says the sword come upon the
[37:18] land
[37:23] and the brother trumpet and won the
[37:27] people now foreign

[38:21] and God is saying he has set the
[38:25] Watchmen
[38:27] to wash over our souls
[38:31] that's why the prophet says God will not
[38:35] take any man to judge me
[38:38] before first warning that man
[38:42] amen and he goes ahead and says that man
[38:47] takes himself to Hell
[38:50] before you go to hell you will fight God
[38:59] blessed with the name of the Lord when
[39:02] the two things were at the cross
[39:08] amen man
[39:10] still the other evil man
[39:14] even after that last moment
[39:17] if you're a Son of God
[39:20] if you are listening

[39:30] we will send warnings
[39:32] you will not find any of those warning
[39:34] outside there

[1:17:03] imagine the rain which fell the other
[1:17:05] day
[1:17:08] that at least
[1:17:11] a woman in the house
[1:17:14] she owed to if that is the kind of money
[1:17:18] you are

[1:19:51] and they break those glasses are in hell
[1:19:54] not in the church

[1:20:16] who were in Ephesus
[1:20:23] amen praise you to God that is the God
[1:20:27] we served
[1:20:28] and that's why we have to come to church
[1:20:34] yes
[1:20:47] a preacher preaches the word which he
[1:20:50] even doesn't understand
[1:20:52] praise be to God
[1:20:55] but when we came besides

[1:22:42] church for thinking it is decent thing
[1:22:45] to do together
[1:22:49] go to church
[1:22:52] to worship God because
[1:22:56] when you are ready to worship God wait
[1:22:59] against your sins
[1:23:01] this is
[1:23:03] me the good thing this is a midweek

[1:24:21] because Christianity is living for
[1:24:23] others
[1:24:26] they didn't ask why you are doing that
[1:24:28] and you're complaining because you are
[1:24:30] selling fish
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:37] who do you want to clean that chair for
[1:24:40] you

[1:26:49] the devil is like flies
[1:26:54] you see when you are in that when you're
[1:26:57] up country there is
[1:27:04] like here in Africa I don't know in
[1:27:06] Europe

[1:27:19] people some people they move with bunch
[1:27:22] of Lies

[1:27:32] don't enter with them flies
[1:27:36] remain outside
[1:27:38] come and be charged
[1:27:43] with the Holy ghosts
[1:27:48] [Music]

[1:28:01] that is why we come to church
[1:28:04] we come to become a better Christians
[1:28:11] praise be to God
[1:28:22] there are many people who are there they
[1:28:24] say I will no longer go back to church
[1:28:27] there are many in this age praise God
[1:28:30] the Holy Ghost has come he is that
[1:28:33] picture oh my what a quote
[1:28:38] um
[1:28:40] when you get that idea
[1:28:43] you are just wrong
[1:28:47] you are wrong
[1:28:49] but why did the Holy Ghost said teachers
[1:28:53] in church
[1:28:57] if he was going to be that teacher yeah
[1:29:03] we don't need preachers
[1:29:08] are you listening to me
[1:29:12] you will meet them
[1:29:16] fellas
[1:29:18] you don't need to go to church
[1:29:20] here is the answer
[1:29:22] praise the Lord why did God put send the
[1:29:27] Holy Ghost
[1:29:30] yes
[1:29:31] for if he was going to be the teacher
[1:29:34] that is a question
[1:29:38] it is joy to go to church
[1:29:46] sisters again
[1:29:54] if Deborah tells me that
[1:29:57] my daughter she will stay home
[1:30:03] why right she doesn't know why she why
[1:30:07] she to come to church
[1:30:10] is supposed to be Joy
[1:30:12] but thank God
[1:30:15] if she has not come that is
[1:30:20] it is the judgment to me
[1:30:23] they will be the one to remind you to go
[1:30:26] to church it better happened preparing
[1:30:27] to go to church
[1:30:30] so whenever I don't see her here
[1:30:35] amen praise be to God so he says God
[1:30:40] said a teacher
[1:30:43] yatura
[1:30:47] you don't need to come to church
[1:30:52] I want to get that right okay he says we
[1:30:56] are just wrong
[1:30:57] why did the Holy Ghost set preachers in
[1:30:59] the church
[1:31:01] the Holy Ghost is the teacher
[1:31:05] said that teach us in the church
[1:31:08] do you think it's contradicting
[1:31:13] it's joy to go to church
[1:31:19] whether someone is dying
[1:31:22] amen whether you have lost somebody
[1:31:25] through his service
[1:31:27] come to church
[1:31:37] whether it's hot or cold
[1:31:42] whether people are fasting
[1:31:47] whatever they are doing it is
[1:32:01] hard for you to go to church
[1:32:05] and press yourself to come when the
[1:32:08] church is open
[1:32:10] there is something wrong
[1:32:20] the spirit of God will run you right
[1:32:24] straight to the church every time oh the

[1:35:20] to recharge those who attend one service
[1:35:22] a week yeah
