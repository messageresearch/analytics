[1:09:42] I was a hopeless case, a hopeless case,
[1:09:49] an empty
[1:09:51] place,
[1:09:54] if not for grace.
[1:09:58] With every eye closed,
[1:10:02] I want us to understand that we are in
[1:10:04] the presence of God.
[1:10:10] But I also understand that we have
[1:10:12] issues
[1:10:15] in our individual lives
[1:10:19] that sometimes hinder us to worship God.
[1:10:23] But the Bible says that he that comes to
[1:10:25] God
[1:10:27] must believe that he is
[1:10:30] and is a reward of those that diligently
[1:10:32] seek.
[1:10:36] May we all come to that realization
[1:10:40] that the Holy Spirit is here
[1:10:43] and God is God
[1:10:46] and he will reward you
[1:10:48] by the end of the service.
[1:10:51] If you diligently seek him
[1:10:54] with all your heart,
[1:10:56] with everything in you,
[1:10:59] he will reward you. He will answer your
[1:11:02] prayer.
[1:11:04] So for just a moment, why don't you
[1:11:06] speak to him?
[1:11:08] Lift up your heart to him.
[1:11:11] Lift up your voice to him
[1:11:14] and tell him what you want him to do.
[1:11:19] Tell him how hungry you are for him.
[1:11:23] Tell him how thirsty
[1:11:27] you are for him this morning.
[1:11:30] Dear Lord Jesus,
[1:11:32] we are so thirsty for you.
[1:11:35] We are so hungry for you this morning.
[1:11:38] Oh Lord, may you come and have your way.
[1:11:42] May you come and minister to us.
[1:11:45] May you come, oh God,
[1:11:48] and let your presence fall.
[1:11:51] May you wrap us in your arms.
[1:11:55] John, may you take us out of of the way.
[1:11:59] May you come, Lord, and be seen.
[1:12:02] Be glorified this morning.
[1:12:05] Be magnified.
[1:12:07] We call on you, oh Lord,
[1:12:10] for you're the strong and mighty tower
[1:12:13] where the righteous run into.
[1:12:17] We are desperate for you this morning.
[1:12:21] How we desire your word,
[1:12:24] your word of life.
[1:12:26] The Bible says, Lord, Thy word is a lamp
[1:12:29] unto my feet.
[1:12:31] May you come and light our way, oh God.
[1:12:35] Light our way through all the trials and
[1:12:36] troubles and suffering
[1:12:38] and all the questions and the doubts, oh
[1:12:41] God.
[1:12:42] May you come and light our way, oh God.
[1:12:46] Let your light shine, oh God,
[1:12:49] in our lives this morning.
[1:12:52] Oh, how we crave for your presence.

[1:18:43] worship
[1:18:45] you.

[1:18:51] I don't care what else is happening. As
[1:18:53] long as I'm breathing, I know you're by
[1:18:56] my side. Promise never to leave me,
[1:18:59] father. No, never alone. Hallelujah.

[1:19:23] long as you're breathing, you can

[1:19:28] doesn't matter what the devil has tried
[1:19:30] to do against your life. Amen. The Lord

[1:19:36] you're breathing. As long as I'm

[1:20:17] Amen. Lord, it doesn't matter what the
[1:20:20] devil's planned against my life. It
[1:20:22] doesn't matter what I see around me,
[1:20:25] Lord. As long as I have breath in me, as
[1:20:28] long as I can still talk. As long as I
[1:20:30] can still clap my hands. As long as I

[1:20:54] the unseen answers, Lord, I know that I
[1:20:57] know you promise that you never leave me
[1:20:59] alone. You never leave us alone this
[1:21:02] morning. And as long as we are
[1:21:03] breathing, Father, we are going to
[1:21:05] worship you, oh God. We are going to
[1:21:07] lift your name above all names for
[1:21:09] Jesus. Jesus is a name above every name
[1:21:12] and every dimension of the name Jesus.
[1:21:14] Every knee shall bow and every tongue
[1:21:16] shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[1:21:19] Amen. You are Lord over every situation.

[1:22:03] for your grace and your goodness and
[1:22:05] your love.
[1:22:07] Oh father we worship you
[1:22:10] because you are worthy to be worshiped.
[1:22:16] You are God above all else.
[1:22:20] Hallelujah.
[1:22:22] Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] Maybe some people who have the
[1:22:25] microphones help me sing that we bless
[1:22:28] you
[1:22:30] on highest place.
[1:22:32] Hallelujah. For you are the high priest.
[1:22:35] Jesus is the high priest this morning.
[1:22:38] He can be touched by the feelings of
[1:22:39] your infirmities.
[1:22:42] Place him in the highest place. Higher
[1:22:45] than your trouble, higher than your
[1:22:46] problem, higher than your question,
[1:22:48] higher than your doubts. Because it's
[1:22:50] God above all else.
[1:22:52] We bless you
[1:22:59] in the highest
[1:23:01] place.
[1:23:04] Come on, lift up your voice now.

[1:27:03] [Applause]
[1:27:07] [Music]
[1:27:10] Oh yes. Let's let's speak to him.
[1:27:13] Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:27:15] Christ,
[1:27:18] we come before you, Lord,
[1:27:21] approaching your throne of mercy this
[1:27:23] morning.
[1:27:26] Lord Jesus, we don't take this moment
[1:27:28] for granted
[1:27:31] that your children have come
[1:27:34] from both near and far,
[1:27:37] but they have come to visit with the
[1:27:38] king.
[1:27:41] They have come to dine on your table.
[1:27:45] Father Lord, I'm very cognizant of the
[1:27:48] fact that you are here
[1:27:51] and you are here to feed us.
[1:27:55] Lord, every need that you see on the
[1:27:56] hearts of your people.
[1:28:00] May you provide, Lord.
[1:28:03] Take me out of the way.
[1:28:05] I have nothing good in myself,
[1:28:08] but I'm relying and depending on you
[1:28:10] completely.
[1:28:12] But Lord, if you can come and take
[1:28:13] control of the vessel
[1:28:17] that your people shall be fed,
[1:28:19] that their needs shall be met
[1:28:23] and they will be joyful
[1:28:26] in their hearts knowing that the Lord
[1:28:29] minister to them.
[1:28:32] Father, I pray that you bless everyone
[1:28:35] young and old,
[1:28:37] small and big, wherever we might belong,
[1:28:41] and everyone under the sound of my
[1:28:42] voice. And even this those connecting to
[1:28:46] this service from afar,
[1:28:49] meet each of our needs as well.
[1:28:52] In the precious name of our Lord,
[1:28:55] amen.
[1:28:58] Amen.
[1:29:01] The Lord bless you, saints.
[1:29:04] You can take your seat for just a
[1:29:05] moment.
[1:29:09] I just want to greet you in the name of
[1:29:11] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:29:16] Turn to your neighbor, tell them God
[1:29:17] bless you. You're welcome.
[1:29:23] Um I also want to um I want to bring
[1:29:27] greetings from uh one of the ministers
[1:29:30] in Ethiopia, brother Asaged. I
[1:29:33] yesterday,
[1:29:37] you know, he sent me a picture of him
[1:29:39] and his entire family streaming our
[1:29:42] Wednesday service.
[1:29:49] He told me they usually do that on on
[1:29:52] Saturdays,
[1:29:56] but he asked that I I greet the the
[1:29:58] church.
[1:30:00] Amen.
[1:30:01] Amen.
[1:30:04] And also many of our friends many times
[1:30:06] they give me greetings and I forget to
[1:30:07] bring them to you.
[1:30:12] Uh but uh just know that many love you
[1:30:14] all over the world
[1:30:18] and many usually send their greetings.
[1:30:21] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[1:30:23] Lord?
[1:30:25] Amen. Amen. Um, brother Martin, I did
[1:30:29] not see the note. Did Did it come
[1:30:31] through?
[1:30:34] There are quite a lot of things here.
[1:30:44] Sometimes I'm left notes and I miss them
[1:30:46] because sometimes the song leave many
[1:30:48] notes around here.
[1:30:56] So the song always remember to take
[1:30:58] away.
[1:31:03] Um yeah before I read this I just wanted
[1:31:06] to also mention um and make a few
[1:31:08] corrections
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:12] from what brother Joel has read
[1:31:18] he mentioned and I just want to correct
[1:31:20] that statement.
[1:31:23] where he said we reduced we used the
[1:31:27] funds and reduced it
[1:31:32] from the meeting that we had.
[1:31:35] We we found that funds which was used on
[1:31:39] the youth camp
[1:31:44] that was not previously pledged or
[1:31:47] whatsoever.
[1:31:51] uh that was a tune of 30.5 million
[1:31:53] shillings.
[1:31:58] We agreed that we will not reduce it
[1:32:01] from our land fund
[1:32:06] and I single-handedly made that decision
[1:32:10] to use those funds on the youth camp
[1:32:15] and I said I'll take responsibility
[1:32:20] to look for it and paid
[1:32:23] and I also ask that if there is anybody
[1:32:24] who wants to come and show down that
[1:32:26] burden.
[1:32:30] You know these are funds that were used
[1:32:32] for the work of God.
[1:32:35] You are welcome to come and do that.
[1:32:39] That did not reflect anywhere in what
[1:32:41] our brother read.
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:46] We are counting it as if as though we
[1:32:49] have already we already have it.
[1:32:53] that is not a burden that we have placed
[1:32:55] on the church.
[1:32:58] However, the amount that he mentioned
[1:33:01] that was removed from the land fund
[1:33:06] his funds that have already been pledged
[1:33:11] and have not been paid.
[1:33:15] Um
[1:33:17] the first pledges we have taken from
[1:33:19] those that had pledged to support the
[1:33:20] youth camp.
[1:33:25] A brother mentioned to me that people
[1:33:27] don't know whether they have debts or
[1:33:29] not.
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:33] So, brother Daniel,
[1:33:36] this figure I didn't take I didn't make
[1:33:37] it up. You gave it to me.
[1:33:43] Daniel and brother Joel,
[1:33:46] please develop a list, a detailed list
[1:33:53] pledged for the youth camp and did not
[1:33:54] fulfill their wish
[1:34:00] so that they can be duly informed
[1:34:04] and uh they will know that they they
[1:34:06] have something they have to pay.
[1:34:10] Um, also I learned one of those is um a
[1:34:13] sister, sister Rose.
[1:34:18] She's not here. She might actually be
[1:34:19] following online. I don't know.
[1:34:22] But uh you know, I think pledged a
[1:34:24] certain amount. I don't know how much.
[1:34:28] And uh uh she then gave march towards
[1:34:32] the youth camp
[1:34:39] and presumed
[1:34:43] that her debt was fully paid.
[1:34:49] But that's different.
[1:34:51] So if you had pledged you have to
[1:34:53] fulfill the pledge
[1:34:57] because it was it was announced
[1:35:01] and then also from the youth I mean from
[1:35:04] the groups
[1:35:08] especially there are two main groups
[1:35:09] William Brham and Martin Luther
[1:35:14] those um will also be provided of those
[1:35:18] lists.
[1:35:21] that you take care of those debts as
[1:35:23] well.
[1:35:25] Those two debts are the ones that have
[1:35:26] been subtracted from the overall total,
[1:35:33] which is the money, the funds we have
[1:35:35] pledged to give and we have not given.
[1:35:40] Is that understood?
[1:35:43] Amen. So going forward
[1:35:48] until those debts are paid
[1:35:53] the brother will announce what we have
[1:35:58] not what we expect to have
[1:36:01] and when these debts are paid then they
[1:36:03] can be added on the overhead.
[1:36:08] Then also we agreed last uh last week
[1:36:13] that those of you who are in you know a
[1:36:16] member of the different groups
[1:36:20] uh please do not pledge.
[1:36:24] Give what you have.
[1:36:27] Give what you have.
[1:36:29] I believe that's what giving is.
[1:36:32] Don't overstress yourself.
[1:36:36] Give what you have also don't think
[1:36:39] there is anything too small.
[1:36:43] Give what you can.
[1:36:45] And uh these brothers and the the team
[1:36:48] leaders and the sisters we want them to
[1:36:50] announce only what has been given not
[1:36:52] what is expected to be given.
[1:37:00] So the team leaders
[1:37:02] be sure if you tell the uh treasurers
[1:37:05] that you have so much money you have it
[1:37:07] in cash
[1:37:12] we will receive it uh on Sunday not
[1:37:14] later than Sunday
[1:37:19] because if we keep announcing funds
[1:37:22] and it's not on the account
[1:37:25] is not received.
[1:37:27] Then when we reduce it this way,
[1:37:30] it feels like as if there is something
[1:37:32] questionable,
[1:37:35] which is not the case.
[1:37:38] We just make sure that you give what you
[1:37:40] have and what you can.
[1:37:43] And also lastly we on the on this issue
[1:37:45] we found out that there are many
[1:37:46] brethren
[1:37:49] among us here that are not giving at
[1:37:52] all.
[1:37:55] You had the march which was announced on
[1:37:57] our land fund today.
[1:38:00] I do not know I've not I did not ask
[1:38:02] them to give me a report but if we make
[1:38:04] a report you might find that only about
[1:38:06] 15 people have given from all the seven
[1:38:09] groups.
[1:38:18] So brethren,
[1:38:20] I'm just as your pastor, I'm asking you
[1:38:23] to put your shoulders to the wheel
[1:38:27] and our income is not the same,
[1:38:30] our ability is not the same.
[1:38:33] But if our purpose and vision is the
[1:38:35] same,
[1:38:37] then we are all going to do what we can
[1:38:39] in our little way.
[1:38:43] to support the cause.
[1:38:46] If you are not in any of the groups,
[1:38:47] please join one
[1:38:52] and ensure that at least within a week
[1:38:54] you give what you can.
[1:38:57] I have a note here and I think that's
[1:38:59] all for now regarding the land fund.
[1:39:04] Today marks 10 years since u I stood
[1:39:07] before God.
[1:39:12] family and friends and and I said I do
[1:39:17] to the love of my life a woman
[1:39:21] of beauty
[1:39:22] strength and wavering grace
[1:39:28] I'm reading a note from a brother
[1:39:32] a decade later
[1:39:34] I stand with even greater conviction
[1:39:39] to say marriage is truly a gift from
[1:39:41] God.
[1:39:44] In these 10 years, we have laughed,
[1:39:46] cried,
[1:39:49] prayed, fallen, and risen always
[1:39:53] together. God has blessed us with not
[1:39:55] only love
[1:39:58] that endures, but also with beautiful
[1:40:00] children
[1:40:02] who daily reminds us that love
[1:40:04] multiplies
[1:40:07] when rooted in Christ
[1:40:10] to his dear wife. He says,
[1:40:13] "Thanks for walking this journey with
[1:40:15] with him
[1:40:18] for your these are words now from your
[1:40:21] husband, sister. I'm reading them.
[1:40:24] These are words now to one person
[1:40:28] from one man.
[1:40:31] He says, "Thanks for walking this
[1:40:32] journey with me
[1:40:36] for your loyalty,
[1:40:38] laughter, prayers, daily sacrifices.
[1:40:42] You made our house, our home, and our
[1:40:44] heart a heaven.
[1:40:49] You are truly God's reward in my life.
[1:40:54] I did not know brother Martin is
[1:41:00] brother
[1:41:03] has this kind of love. Love is a
[1:41:06] beautiful thing.
[1:41:09] He says as we celebrate this 10th
[1:41:11] anniversary
[1:41:14] I look back with gratitude
[1:41:18] and ahead with great expectations.
[1:41:22] With God at the center, we shall reach
[1:41:24] the goal.
[1:41:27] This is from brother Shalom family.
[1:41:31] Shalom.
[1:41:32] Amen. I'd like to to to say we
[1:41:34] appreciate you, brother Martin.
[1:41:40] And we want to congratulate you
[1:41:43] on your 10th marriage anniversary.
[1:41:52] Amen.
[1:41:55] Amen. It's wonderful to celebrate love
[1:41:57] always.
[1:42:00] And brother, if you want to give a gift
[1:42:06] and a gift, you want to buy something
[1:42:07] for them.
[1:42:10] Feel free. I'm sure they will love it.
[1:42:14] Father, we should learn to celebrate one
[1:42:16] another.
[1:42:19] To celebrate one another,
[1:42:23] to celebrate one another.
[1:42:28] You understand? We should always look at
[1:42:31] them and want the best for them.
[1:42:36] Amen.
[1:42:38] Praise the name of the Lord. I see him
[1:42:40] as a a pillow.
[1:42:44] God bless you.
[1:42:47] Nice to be with you today in the
[1:42:48] congregation.
[1:42:50] This is the father, the grandfather of
[1:42:52] brother polycap.

[1:43:51] chapter 13.
[1:44:06] There are days when I uh preach without
[1:44:10] quoting from the message of brother
[1:44:11] Bernham
[1:44:16] and there are days when all my preaching
[1:44:18] is filled with quotes.
[1:44:23] It's not there's no method to it.
[1:44:27] It's just leadership
[1:44:30] and this service is one of those that
[1:44:32] are going to be filled with a lot of
[1:44:33] quotes
[1:44:36] and the media department. I pray that
[1:44:38] you help me project those both online
[1:44:40] and here
[1:44:47] so that people can as well follow.
[1:44:51] Now we are reading out of the book of
[1:44:53] Matthew 13 24.
[1:44:59] And we are reading um a few verses out
[1:45:03] of that.
[1:45:07] Amen.
[1:45:09] And and we're reading from 24 to 30.
[1:45:14] And another parable put he forth unto
[1:45:16] them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is
[1:45:18] likened unto a man which sowed good seed
[1:45:20] in his field. But while men slept, his
[1:45:24] enemy came and saw tears among the wheat
[1:45:26] and went his way. But when the blade was
[1:45:29] sprung up and brought forth fruit, then
[1:45:32] appeared the tears also. So the servants
[1:45:35] of the householder came and said unto
[1:45:37] him, Sir, did not thou s good seed in
[1:45:41] the in thy field? From whence then hast
[1:45:44] tears? He said unto them, An enemy has
[1:45:48] done this. The servant said unto him,
[1:45:51] "Wilt to thou then that we go and gather
[1:45:54] them up?" But he said, "Nay, lest while
[1:45:57] ye gather up the tears, ye root up also
[1:46:00] the wheat with them. Let both grow
[1:46:02] together until the harvest. And in the
[1:46:05] time of of harvest, I would say to the
[1:46:07] reapers, gather ye together first the
[1:46:11] tears, and bind them in bundles to burn
[1:46:14] them, but gather the wheat into my barn.

[1:47:27] Uganda.
[1:47:33] Amen. Amen. Let us pray.
[1:47:36] Precious Lord, we approach your throne
[1:47:38] right now this morning.
[1:47:42] Lord, when I look at myself,
[1:47:45] my abilities,
[1:47:47] I don't see how I can speak to these
[1:47:49] people to a point where I can say you
[1:47:51] have spoken to them.
[1:47:57] But Lord, if you can come and take me
[1:47:59] out of the way
[1:48:01] and help me to yield to you,
[1:48:04] then surely you can use me, Lord, to
[1:48:06] speak to your children.
[1:48:09] Father, even my brother, the
[1:48:11] interpreter,
[1:48:13] I also commit him to you. Father, it's a
[1:48:17] very soft moment this morning,
[1:48:20] a time where we can sit, relax, and hear
[1:48:23] from you.
[1:48:26] Lord, may you speak to each one
[1:48:30] according to their needs
[1:48:32] in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:48:35] Amen.
[1:48:36] Please be seated.
[1:48:44] Hallelujah.
[1:48:50] Amen.
[1:48:52] There's a young man, Kevin. Is is
[1:48:55] brother Kevin here?
[1:49:00] If you're here, just lift up your hands.
[1:49:08] I've been looking at you, but I did not
[1:49:09] recognize you.
[1:49:12] I spoke a little bit about him in the in
[1:49:15] the wedding the other day in in the
[1:49:17] graduation.
[1:49:21] So I'm so happy to see you today. Please
[1:49:24] join me to welcome him. God bless you.
[1:49:27] Thank you for coming.
[1:49:30] Where is Sister Peace?
[1:49:33] Ah I am I'm used to seeing you here.
[1:49:37] So uh congratulations.
[1:49:40] Let us all congratulate her.
[1:49:44] Amen. We were at her graduation party
[1:49:47] yesterday.
[1:49:49] And uh I know that people were invited
[1:49:52] on Wednesday.
[1:49:54] Those of you complaining, we are not
[1:49:56] invited.
[1:49:58] You just missed the Wednesday service.
[1:50:01] That's how you did not know about it.
[1:50:04] Most of the people who are here on
[1:50:05] Wednesday
[1:50:07] then we got to learn that we were
[1:50:09] invited
[1:50:11] and it was a good time
[1:50:13] that we had. I also believe in sharing
[1:50:15] the word
[1:50:18] is brother Julius here also.
[1:50:21] No,
[1:50:25] can you lift up your hands?
[1:50:28] You brothers are changing seats.
[1:50:32] God bless you. Brother Julius was in
[1:50:35] inaital
[1:50:38] last Sunday
[1:50:40] and he told me he brought he brings
[1:50:41] greetings from there.
[1:50:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:46] So, I'm going to um I have a like I told
[1:50:48] you, it's been a lot of things on my
[1:50:50] heart to share with the church here
[1:50:56] since the past since since the past few
[1:50:58] weeks.
[1:51:00] I do not know how far we'll go, but I
[1:51:02] just pray that you pray for me.
[1:51:05] and uh those on the media department I
[1:51:07] don't know how you are going to title it
[1:51:11] but I'm really continuing with our
[1:51:12] series
[1:51:14] and this morning I'm speaking on a
[1:51:17] subject overcoming overcoming power in
[1:51:19] the seat
[1:51:24] overcoming power
[1:51:26] in the seat
[1:51:28] ask your neighbor are you ready for the
[1:51:30] word
[1:51:33] amen praise the Lord Remember, it's not
[1:51:37] the preacher that preaches.
[1:51:39] It is the congregation that makes the
[1:51:41] preacher preach.
[1:51:44] And if there is a congregation that I
[1:51:45] love,
[1:51:47] it is here at DVM.
[1:51:50] And you really know how to make a
[1:51:51] preacher preach.
[1:51:53] But when you preach to a congregation
[1:51:55] that is dozing,
[1:51:57] sleeping,
[1:51:58] tired, very official,
[1:52:01] they don't want to say amen. then the
[1:52:04] Holy Spirit cannot move.
[1:52:06] But you know how to make the Holy Spirit
[1:52:08] move and may God bless you for that.
[1:52:12] So um overcoming power in the sin.
[1:52:17] Did you know what overcomes the world
[1:52:23] is not in anything that is out of you?
[1:52:31] What overcomes the world
[1:52:34] is something that is already in you.
[1:52:40] We are not made children of God.
[1:52:46] The preaching of the word,
[1:52:48] listen carefully,
[1:52:51] the preaching of this word
[1:52:54] does not make you a child of God.
[1:52:59] It makes you understand.
[1:53:03] You are a child of God.
[1:53:07] The preaching of the word does not
[1:53:08] change you from a pig to a sheep.
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:25] Do you understand what I'm saying? The
[1:53:27] preaching of the word
[1:53:30] makes a sheep
[1:53:33] that is lost
[1:53:36] remember who they are
[1:53:39] come out of the pig pen
[1:53:42] and come back to where they belong.
[1:53:47] You remember the prodigal son. That is
[1:53:49] how that's the purpose of the preaching
[1:53:51] of the gospel
[1:53:54] is for the prodigos.
[1:53:57] That's why we say for the lost.
[1:54:00] We are preaching to the lost.
[1:54:03] We are not preaching to the sin. The
[1:54:05] ones who who are not lost.
[1:54:08] We are preaching to the lost.
[1:54:11] The sinners the ones we call sinners are
[1:54:14] the lost.
[1:54:16] If I have a child
[1:54:19] and I lose my child
[1:54:22] then I would say my child is lost
[1:54:26] but to begin with he is my child.
[1:54:31] So I am not looking for a child I have
[1:54:34] never born.
[1:54:38] If you have never bore a child
[1:54:41] you cannot say my my child got lost.
[1:54:45] Imagine if brother Marvin here
[1:54:48] begin saying I'm looking for my lost
[1:54:51] children.
[1:54:53] Everybody will look at you and say, "So
[1:54:56] brother, you have been here lying to us
[1:54:59] thinking you are a good young man
[1:55:02] who is holy who is not moving around."
[1:55:07] So you have children. You understand the
[1:55:10] concept.
[1:55:11] So brother Marvin can't say he has lost
[1:55:13] children.
[1:55:16] If he knew if he knows the way he has
[1:55:18] lived.
[1:55:20] But if you know you have had children in
[1:55:23] your life biologically
[1:55:28] and you don't have any now,
[1:55:32] but you know they are somewhere in the
[1:55:33] world.
[1:55:35] Then you will have a thirst and a hunger
[1:55:40] to go look and find them.
[1:55:43] Wherever they are,
[1:55:45] you you you you will be determined. I
[1:55:49] have to find my lost children
[1:55:52] because they were yours to begin with.
[1:55:55] So, can they be lost? Not forever
[1:55:59] because they were meant to be with you.
[1:56:02] They came from you. So, they belong with
[1:56:05] you and they belong in you.
[1:56:08] Are you hearing me? Now take it
[1:56:11] spiritually.
[1:56:13] God has not come to save everyone in the
[1:56:17] world.
[1:56:22] John 3:16.
[1:56:24] For God so loved the world
[1:56:28] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:56:32] that whoever believeth in him
[1:56:36] shall
[1:56:42] shall
[1:56:46] shall not
[1:56:50] shall have everlasting life.
[1:56:53] Whosoever believeth in him, oh may God
[1:56:56] help us to see what
[1:56:59] you hear what I'm saying and open your
[1:57:01] heart
[1:57:03] now.
[1:57:05] Those that were in the mind of God,
[1:57:09] the Bible says,
[1:57:11] those that he forneew,
[1:57:15] he also predestinated
[1:57:20] to be conformed
[1:57:24] to the image of son.
[1:57:29] Meaning those that he predestinated,
[1:57:34] he forneew,
[1:57:36] where were they? Did they pre-exist?
[1:57:41] No, we did not preexist.
[1:57:46] But we were in his mind.
[1:57:50] We were in him
[1:57:52] before we came into manifestation.
[1:57:57] Are you hearing me? So the seed of God
[1:58:01] is in us. But you cannot know
[1:58:05] who is who
[1:58:08] because sin came in.
[1:58:10] When the sin barrier came in,
[1:58:14] it blocked everyone
[1:58:18] from coming into the glory of God.
[1:58:21] Another Bible says, "For all have sinned
[1:58:25] and all have come short of the glory of
[1:58:28] God."
[1:58:31] Now listen, church, sin is not
[1:58:34] wrongdoing.
[1:58:37] Everyone a seed of God and the serpent
[1:58:42] sin will do wrongdoing.
[1:58:47] Are you following me? They will all do
[1:58:49] wrongdoing.
[1:58:51] So what determines who we are?
[1:58:55] It is not what we have done.
[1:58:59] You might do good all your life
[1:59:03] when you are not a seed of God.
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:06] We have examples in the
[1:59:10] richer.
[1:59:12] Oh this good man he come to himself
[1:59:15] good man.
[1:59:17] What shall I do
[1:59:20] in order to inherit eternal life?
[1:59:24] What did Jesus answer? He said, "You
[1:59:26] know the law, go and do the works of the
[1:59:29] law." He said, "That what I've done
[1:59:32] since I was a child. I have never
[1:59:37] murdered him. I've never, you know,
[1:59:39] lied. I have never, you know, all the
[1:59:42] ten commandments,
[1:59:45] he mentioned them.
[1:59:47] And he had never broken any of them.
[1:59:53] Are you following me?
[1:59:55] Never broken any of
[1:59:59] he had a void in his heart.
[2:00:02] He felt the law was not enough.
[2:00:07] The works he had done were not enough.
[2:00:12] He needed something else
[2:00:16] which cannot be attained by the works of
[2:00:19] the law.
[2:00:23] Jesus being who he was.
[2:00:28] You know, is this not a scripture that I
[2:00:30] I was meant to read today?
[2:00:33] But now that I've said it, let's go over
[2:00:37] it a little bit.
[2:00:38] May God help you so that you can preach
[2:00:40] this as well.
[2:00:40] Amen.
[2:00:41] Hallelujah.
[2:00:42] Hallelujah.
[2:00:43] Pray for us here.
[2:00:46] God is about to give you something
[2:00:49] which is going to help you.
[2:00:52] This rich young man
[2:00:56] when he came he said good man.
[2:00:59] Jesus answered what? He said why do you
[2:01:02] call me good?
[2:01:04] Only God is good.
[2:01:08] Do you realize what Jesus was saying
[2:01:09] right there?
[2:01:12] Jesus did not deny to be good
[2:01:17] but he he said only God is good.
[2:01:20] The fact that he did not deny he is good
[2:01:25] means he accepted he is God
[2:01:29] and he was actually telling this young
[2:01:30] woman.
[2:01:32] I expect you know who you are talking
[2:01:34] to.
[2:01:37] You are calling me good. Only God is
[2:01:40] good.
[2:01:42] Just know which means if you're calling
[2:01:45] me good then you have come to me. You
[2:01:49] must believe that I am.
[2:01:52] Amen. I am God. I am good. I am able to
[2:01:56] save you. I'm able to fill the void in
[2:01:58] your heart.
[2:02:01] about this that younger man missed it.
[2:02:06] When you come to God and you miss who
[2:02:08] God is,
[2:02:11] God is the word.
[2:02:13] But when you come to God and you do not
[2:02:16] receive him,
[2:02:18] no matter what he says, it can never
[2:02:20] save you.
[2:02:22] No matter what he did, he can never save
[2:02:24] you.
[2:02:27] But this young man,
[2:02:30] he was told everything to do. He said,
[2:02:33] "I've done that." He said, "All right,
[2:02:36] there is one more thing." Hallelujah.
[2:02:38] Hallelujah.
[2:02:39] There is one more thing you must do.
[2:02:41] Sell everything you have. Give to the
[2:02:44] poor. Come follow who? Come follow who?
[2:02:49] Who are you?
[2:02:51] the word.
[2:02:55] Did this man understand it?
[2:03:02] No,
[2:03:03] he missed it.
[2:03:05] And because he missed it,
[2:03:08] he could not get salvation.
[2:03:12] He missed it. When did he miss it? When
[2:03:16] Jesus said, "There is none that is good.
[2:03:17] Only God is good.
[2:03:21] That's when he missed it. He had never
[2:03:23] understood.
[2:03:25] It's not about what the law says.
[2:03:29] The law came
[2:03:31] for one reason. That people may be holy
[2:03:34] even as God is holy.
[2:03:38] For the law is for the end reason,
[2:03:42] not the process.
[2:03:44] So, it's all about you being holy.
[2:03:48] It's all about you being holy.
[2:03:53] It is all about you being holy.
[2:03:57] Not fulfilling the law,
[2:03:59] but being holy as God.
[2:04:03] The law was a school master
[2:04:06] to bring us to real true holiness.
[2:04:11] Real true holiness is Jesus Christ.
[2:04:15] Real true holiness is the full word of
[2:04:17] God.
[2:04:19] But this young man did not understand
[2:04:23] all the law and all the prophets spoke
[2:04:28] about the man standing before him.
[2:04:31] This younger man did understand.
[2:04:34] And when Jesus said God said everything
[2:04:37] you give to the poor come follow me.
[2:04:42] He did not understand why.
[2:04:45] You who is poor, you has nothing. You
[2:04:49] has no place where you
[2:04:53] sell all my goods. I come follow you. I
[2:04:56] cannot. The Bible says, "Hear me. Hear
[2:04:59] me." The Bible says he walked away
[2:05:03] sad in his heart
[2:05:05] because he had a lot of wealth.
[2:05:08] He missed it. But if he had attained it,
[2:05:12] if he had received it, he would have
[2:05:15] understood
[2:05:17] everything else does not matter.
[2:05:20] But the word matters
[2:05:22] and the word at that time
[2:05:25] Jesus Christ himself
[2:05:28] standing before him,
[2:05:30] but he missed it. And even today,
[2:05:34] people still miss it.
[2:05:39] People still miss it.
[2:05:42] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:05:45] May God help you this morning
[2:05:48] so that you do not miss it.
[2:05:51] Tell your neighbor, do not miss it.
[2:05:56] So the kingdom of of heaven
[2:05:59] here in the in in the in the in the
[2:06:01] place where we have read
[2:06:04] is likening it onto a man which sold
[2:06:05] good seed in his field
[2:06:09] and I was talking to you about a seed
[2:06:13] and how the power is in the seed.
[2:06:16] You see before we we continue with this
[2:06:19] verse
[2:06:21] I I was trying to show you
[2:06:24] try and demonstrate for you
[2:06:27] that the power
[2:06:29] is not in the preaching of the gospel
[2:06:36] as much as it is.
[2:06:40] But the power
[2:06:42] is in the seed.
[2:06:45] For God so loved the world
[2:06:49] that he gave his only begotten son.
[2:06:53] Whosoever believeth
[2:06:58] shall not perish.
[2:07:00] Did this young man believe in him?
[2:07:05] Did he believe?
[2:07:07] You are absent.
[2:07:11] Am I preaching to 10 people?
[2:07:15] Did this young man believe in him?
[2:07:18] What did he do? He it he felt it was
[2:07:22] very hard
[2:07:25] and he walked away.
[2:07:27] Why?
[2:07:29] Oh, this is the most interesting part.
[2:07:32] Why did he believe?
[2:07:36] He never received revelation.
[2:07:39] Why didn't he receive the virgin?
[2:07:42] Because he was not a seed.
[2:07:47] Only the seed of God
[2:07:50] will receive the true revelation
[2:07:54] of the word.
[2:07:57] Upon this rock, upon this revelation,
[2:08:01] I will build my church. And the gates of
[2:08:04] hell shall never prevail. against
[2:08:09] the church of Jesus
[2:08:11] built upon the revelation
[2:08:16] but only the seed of God
[2:08:19] every generation
[2:08:22] receive the revelation
[2:08:25] receive revelation
[2:08:28] never receive revelation
[2:08:31] hallelujah
[2:08:33] s
[2:08:34] the original sin they ate apples
[2:08:38] He gave apples. No revelation. But here
[2:08:42] is one with revelation.
[2:08:46] What did he give? He gave blood.
[2:08:50] He gave a sacrifice
[2:08:52] because he had received a revelation.
[2:08:55] S came in by mixing blood.
[2:09:01] Will be taken away.
[2:09:03] shedding of blood.
[2:09:06] That was a revelation
[2:09:08] and a true church
[2:09:10] built upon the revelation
[2:09:13] of the word. The revelation
[2:09:17] of Jesus Christ, the revelation of your
[2:09:20] word. Jesus Christ and the word is the
[2:09:23] same.
[2:09:26] [Applause]
[2:09:28] Amen.
[2:09:29] Hallelujah.
[2:09:31] I feel like beginning to preach.
[2:09:35] and then came God in the garden of Eden.
[2:09:40] He began his sermon.
[2:09:43] His sermon title that day
[2:09:46] was if thou will believe.
[2:09:52] He didn't have to open any book. He was
[2:09:54] the book
[2:09:57] because he was the same yesterday done
[2:09:59] forever.
[2:10:01] He saw what had happened and he turned
[2:10:04] to Cain and he began preaching. Oh Cain
[2:10:08] my son, if thou doest good, will you not
[2:10:12] be received? Will you not be accepted?
[2:10:16] Repent of your ways. Do good
[2:10:20] and I will accept you.
[2:10:24] And Cain looked on.
[2:10:26] Cain could not accept
[2:10:30] when God punished him.
[2:10:33] He said, "My punishment is too great."
[2:10:37] And he was the first human being
[2:10:42] to receive the mark of the beast.
[2:10:52] Some I had thank God for this message of
[2:10:57] I had one one one preacher
[2:11:01] saying, "Oh, and and Cain cried."
[2:11:04] He said, "Oh God, the punishment you
[2:11:06] have given me is too great."
[2:11:08] And God said, "It's all right, my son. I
[2:11:11] put a mark on you, but whosoever sees
[2:11:14] you and he kills you, you will be you
[2:11:17] will be avenged for
[2:11:19] and this mark will protect you from
[2:11:21] being killed." And then the preacher
[2:11:24] began
[2:11:26] saying, "May God give you the same,
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:33] I'm glad you never said amen."
[2:11:36] because you are a true message believer
[2:11:39] who has a revelation.
[2:11:43] You go in the book of revelation.
[2:11:46] The Bible says that it shall it shall
[2:11:48] cause both small and great
[2:11:52] to receive a mark on their forehead or
[2:11:56] in their right hand.
[2:11:58] And this mark those who have it they
[2:12:02] will not be killed.
[2:12:05] When the tribulation begins
[2:12:07] they will not be killed. They will not
[2:12:10] be persecuted
[2:12:12] because they have the mark.
[2:12:15] What is the secret? The devil does not
[2:12:18] persecute his.
[2:12:23] That's the mark of the beast.
[2:12:26] They marked away.
[2:12:29] from the word from God.
[2:12:32] But God gives his
[2:12:35] a life
[2:12:39] which is the Holy Ghost.
[2:12:41] But Cain received the mark of the
[2:12:44] mirror.
[2:12:45] It was to show
[2:12:48] was not a seed of God.
[2:12:52] And Cain can never be a seed of God.
[2:12:56] And that's why you could not overcome.
[2:12:59] You could not believe the first sermon.
[2:13:03] You could not believe the good news
[2:13:04] brought.
[2:13:06] You could not bring believe the gospel
[2:13:09] was preached.
[2:13:11] It doesn't matter. Our preacher is
[2:13:13] preaching.
[2:13:15] Sometimes we preach until we want to die
[2:13:17] on the pullpit.
[2:13:19] But if you have no seat
[2:13:23] or life in you, you will still walk away
[2:13:27] and you will not believe it.
[2:13:31] That is why we do we don't believe in
[2:13:35] babing people.
[2:13:38] Please stay. Please don't go. Okay. We
[2:13:41] shall change what we are preaching.
[2:13:43] Okay. Now women can dress the way they
[2:13:45] want.
[2:13:46] No, we will preach what the word say.
[2:13:50] We will say what the say
[2:13:53] what the Bible say. If you want to walk
[2:13:56] away, you walk away. But Jesus say my
[2:14:01] sheep know my voice.
[2:14:04] They can never walk away.
[2:14:09] That's why brother, we need a word.
[2:14:14] We need a word.
[2:14:17] We need a church
[2:14:19] people
[2:14:23] are charged up eat and feed on the word.
[2:14:29] That's what we need. The rapture is
[2:14:31] going to be for a word bride.
[2:14:36] Amen. It's not going to be a church for
[2:14:39] people who receive so many miracles.
[2:14:43] You can receive all you want. And it's
[2:14:46] our portion.
[2:14:47] We should also receive the miracles.
[2:14:51] Am I preaching to you, brother?
[2:14:54] Stay with me now.
[2:14:56] Are you following me? We believe in
[2:14:59] miracles.
[2:15:00] Tell your neighbor, we believe in
[2:15:01] miracles.
[2:15:04] We believe in signs and wonders.
[2:15:08] But today
[2:15:11] there is a revelation that God is going
[2:15:12] to give you
[2:15:14] that will deficiate
[2:15:18] then you may know
[2:15:20] where you are standing.
[2:15:25] Hallelujah.
[2:15:25] Hallelujah.
[2:15:26] I see a lot of people moving around
[2:15:29] that's really distracting the Holy
[2:15:31] Spirit.
[2:15:33] Please stop it.
[2:15:35] So let's continue here.
[2:15:38] You see whenever we are going into
[2:15:40] another room then somebody begins to
[2:15:41] move around.
[2:15:44] It affects very much
[2:15:48] and if the Holy Spirit is grieved
[2:15:51] because those of you moving around
[2:15:54] I don't know whether he will bless you.
[2:15:56] So please stay put and stay focused.
[2:16:00] There are those who are going to stay
[2:16:01] focused and hear what the spirit has for
[2:16:04] you this morning.
[2:16:07] Amen.
[2:16:09] Praise the name of the Lord. So the seed
[2:16:15] you can bury it but the seed will always
[2:16:20] sprout.
[2:16:22] The seed will always receive the word.
[2:16:27] The seed will always bring forth of its
[2:16:29] kind.
[2:16:31] So overcoming power
[2:16:35] is not something you attain.
[2:16:38] Overcoming power is already in you.
[2:16:43] If you are a seed of God,
[2:16:47] as long as the word is preached,
[2:16:51] as long as the word,
[2:16:54] the seed in you
[2:16:57] will be quickened.
[2:17:00] Will be quickened.
[2:17:03] You see now why it is important for us
[2:17:04] to have a world church.
[2:17:08] Meaning a place where the word is
[2:17:10] emphasized.
[2:17:14] We believe in signs of miracles as the
[2:17:16] power of God.
[2:17:19] But that is the minor of the gospel.
[2:17:25] The major of the gospel
[2:17:27] is the opening of the word
[2:17:31] and the bride major on a major.
[2:17:36] We don't major on a minor,
[2:17:39] we major on the major.
[2:17:43] We emphasize the important things.
[2:17:47] We emphasize the things that make us
[2:17:49] alive.
[2:17:52] That is why Jesus said the sign shall
[2:17:55] follow.
[2:17:58] What are you following?
[2:18:00] You are not following the sign.
[2:18:03] are following the word and the signs
[2:18:05] must follow.
[2:18:08] God will believe in the word.
[2:18:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:18:13] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:18:16] Amen.
[2:18:17] So the kingdom of heaven is likened unto
[2:18:19] a man
[2:18:22] which sold good seed in the field.
[2:18:25] But while men slept
[2:18:28] his enemy and right
[2:18:30] I'll tell you what the men are the
[2:18:32] disciples
[2:18:35] the messengers
[2:18:37] when they slept when they died.
[2:18:40] Then the tears started to be sold.
[2:18:44] Apostle Paul had warned the church and
[2:18:47] he told them when we are going grievous
[2:18:49] wolves shall come.
[2:18:53] Those are the ones who came and saw the
[2:18:54] tears.
[2:18:57] The the the the the field is your heart.
[2:19:02] The church, you see, and and the seed
[2:19:06] that has been planted in you is the
[2:19:07] word. And you
[2:19:10] yourself, you are a seed.
[2:19:13] All right. Now, follow me closely. I
[2:19:16] promise to read a lot of quotes and I'm
[2:19:17] going to begin with one here in the
[2:19:21] discrepancy.
[2:19:25] What is the seed of discrepancy?
[2:19:31] And now as we approach this
[2:19:35] of this sewing of the seed
[2:19:38] and reaping now he interprets it. And
[2:19:42] then I believe that Jesus was speaking
[2:19:44] this parable in his day
[2:19:48] but was meaning it to be at the end of
[2:19:50] the world.
[2:19:54] the end of the age
[2:19:57] which is this day.
[2:20:00] And I believe this little text tonight
[2:20:02] is very appropriate for the hour that we
[2:20:05] are living in.
[2:20:10] Because Jesus distinctly said here that
[2:20:12] a gathering would be at the end of this
[2:20:14] world.
[2:20:20] that there is when the end would be
[2:20:24] the gathering of the wheat and also the
[2:20:27] gathering of the tears.
[2:20:30] Now the tires are the bad seed
[2:20:33] which was sown by the bad swer
[2:20:38] are you following me?
[2:20:41] The good seed is the elect, the word
[2:20:44] bride
[2:20:46] which was sown by God.
[2:20:50] They were
[2:20:51] but the tires
[2:20:53] were sown by the bad
[2:20:57] Satan and other denominations.
[2:21:01] They formed groups and groups and bands.
[2:21:04] But Jesus said, "Do not uproot the bad
[2:21:08] seed.
[2:21:11] Let it grow together in the same field
[2:21:17] of Christianity.
[2:21:20] Let them go together
[2:21:28] where men shall be separated from women
[2:21:33] of any time. That's when Amen. The blade
[2:21:38] the bread he called it you know the the
[2:21:40] it will be sprung up
[2:21:43] the blade will be sprung up
[2:21:45] and it will begin to shift and cut.
[2:21:50] The tears
[2:21:51] they will be bundled together
[2:21:54] for the burning
[2:21:56] and the wheat will be bundled together
[2:21:59] and
[2:22:01] burn
[2:22:03] the rapture.
[2:22:07] It will all be in the end time.
[2:22:10] But Jesus said, "Let it grow together."
[2:22:15] So we have a church
[2:22:17] called the church of Jesus.
[2:22:20] Do not ever think
[2:22:22] every soalled Christian is a true
[2:22:24] Christian.
[2:22:29] Do not ever think every soal believer is
[2:22:31] a genuine believer.
[2:22:36] We have to see it and they growing side
[2:22:40] by side.
[2:22:42] We don't know who is who, but there is a
[2:22:45] time when our seeds are going to be
[2:22:48] separated.
[2:22:50] And that time is the end time.
[2:22:54] It is no longer in the future.
[2:22:57] We have arrived
[2:22:59] in the end time.
[2:23:02] There is no other age.
[2:23:05] Like it says the very last age.
[2:23:10] Give me the picture of the of the golden
[2:23:11] candlestick.
[2:23:13] We're in the very last chapter
[2:23:17] and after this the rapture is the only
[2:23:19] thing going.
[2:23:22] So this is important. We talk about it
[2:23:23] in this hour.
[2:23:27] That's when the end would be
[2:23:29] the gathering of the wheat and also the
[2:23:32] gathering of the tears
[2:23:34] and the burning of them. and they will
[2:23:37] take the wheat into the kingdom.
[2:23:40] All right. I continue here. Now, I'm
[2:23:42] going to read you a story.
[2:23:45] You see right here, this is the first
[2:23:47] church age.
[2:23:50] Ephesus. Paul was the apostle, the
[2:23:53] messenger to the Gentiles.
[2:23:56] And you can see all the way
[2:23:58] that seed has been growing to
[2:24:04] when you read Revelation 1 23
[2:24:08] whenever he talks about a church
[2:24:12] he says to the church of Ephesus
[2:24:15] to the messenger of the church.
[2:24:18] So he is talking he's addressing the
[2:24:21] church
[2:24:23] but within that church if you read the
[2:24:26] things he's talking about that church
[2:24:29] you can see he's addressing two
[2:24:31] different churches within one church
[2:24:38] in every church age
[2:24:41] because that se has been twice
[2:24:47] growing. side by side
[2:24:51] inter
[2:24:53] side by side
[2:24:55] and we don't know which is we but he say
[2:24:59] at the time of the end
[2:25:02] the blood will be sprung
[2:25:07] and when it is then there's going to be
[2:25:10] a separation
[2:25:13] between the wheat
[2:25:15] and the tears
[2:25:18] Ask your neighbor, are you a
[2:25:27] witch or a
[2:25:34] Don't tell me that abusers and you go
[2:25:36] away. It was a question because we don't
[2:25:39] know now
[2:25:43] who is a wareh
[2:25:53] that's 5% of you can preach the 5% of
[2:25:56] you do you want to know
[2:26:00] let's get deeper now there is this story
[2:26:04] that brother gives and I think same
[2:26:07] message uh uh uh paragraph 8.
[2:26:12] Now he he gives this story when William
[2:26:15] Brham was starting his ministry
[2:26:19] and uh he this we're talking about the
[2:26:21] year 1933 there about
[2:26:25] and he's telling this story in 1965
[2:26:30] and he is now telling the people when he
[2:26:33] first came among the Pentecost Remember
[2:26:39] for him he was born a prophet.
[2:26:42] He had a sign. He had supernatural uh
[2:26:47] gift.
[2:26:49] He could discern people.
[2:26:52] You could know who is who.
[2:26:55] Uh but you know he was a Baptist
[2:26:59] by denomination
[2:27:01] at the time. So now he gets him
[2:27:04] introduced
[2:27:06] to the Pentecostal people.
[2:27:09] And here in his own words, he tells the
[2:27:12] story.
[2:27:13] You are about to find out something very
[2:27:15] amazing.
[2:27:17] All right, brother. Give me the words so
[2:27:19] the people can follow. I remember my
[2:27:21] first experience of ever coming among
[2:27:23] the Pentecostal people.
[2:27:28] I was at Mishawaka Indiana
[2:27:32] and I was at a great convention.
[2:27:36] a whole about like this where north and
[2:27:39] south had come together
[2:27:42] because them days of the segregation
[2:27:44] they had to meet up there.
[2:27:48] There were two great orders of the
[2:27:49] Pentecostal brethren.
[2:27:53] I had never heard of them or met them
[2:27:55] before.
[2:27:57] The first time I ever heard speaking in
[2:27:59] tongues,
[2:28:02] it was there at the end of the row of
[2:28:05] the convention.
[2:28:07] Me being not a member among them,
[2:28:10] I was just a Baptist young minister.
[2:28:14] I was seated way in the back. And I
[2:28:17] remember the first time I heard anyone
[2:28:19] speak in tongues.
[2:28:22] I didn't even know that what it was all
[2:28:24] about. And then these two men mainly
[2:28:29] they sat up in the front.
[2:28:33] One would speak in tongues and another
[2:28:36] one would interpret what the man had
[2:28:39] said.
[2:28:41] And I'm so thankful that we have seen
[2:28:42] that happen in our church here.
[2:28:46] Amen.
[2:28:47] It is a blessing that we can still have
[2:28:50] a church
[2:28:51] where tongues are heard
[2:28:54] and interpretation is received.
[2:28:58] Brother Bam here was experiencing it for
[2:29:00] the first time.
[2:29:02] Well, I just started studying by my
[2:29:05] Bible
[2:29:10] because he had never seen it before.
[2:29:15] I almost didn't say it but let me say
[2:29:18] and today we have a lot of message
[2:29:21] Baptists
[2:29:24] who have not ever seen it before.
[2:29:29] For brother Bam was a Baptist Baptist.
[2:29:33] They never seen it before.
[2:29:36] May God give us churches,
[2:29:39] fellowships,
[2:29:41] altars
[2:29:42] where the true Pentecostal message will
[2:29:45] be preached,
[2:29:48] where we will still see signs and
[2:29:49] wonders,
[2:29:51] tongues and interpretation,
[2:29:54] visions and prophecy. Amen. Amen. That's
[2:29:57] the kind of church I want. Not a dead
[2:30:00] Baptist religion.
[2:30:03] We want a real living God.
[2:30:06] [Applause]
[2:30:08] Amen.
[2:30:10] So listen as I follow the story and I
[2:30:13] remember the first time I heard you know
[2:30:16] these two men you know were seated where
[2:30:17] I just started studying my Bible as hard
[2:30:19] as I could
[2:30:23] then there and I found out one scripture
[2:30:28] but that was scriptural.
[2:30:32] Amen. Can you say that is scriptural
[2:30:35] and interpretation is scriptural?
[2:30:39] If you don't like it, I'm sorry. You are
[2:30:41] dev
[2:30:43] here. We believe in tong and
[2:30:45] interpretation.
[2:30:50] That's exactly what the scripture
[2:30:53] the Holy Spirit would do.
[2:30:58] Brother, we are not singing this song.
[2:30:59] Oh, is this a song?
[2:31:01] No, it's a quote.
[2:31:04] All right. You don't have the table
[2:31:06] software. Oh, sorry for you, brother
[2:31:08] Marvin. Get it next time, please. All
[2:31:10] right. Well, let's let's continue to
[2:31:12] paragraph 12. After that,
[2:31:15] I thought,
[2:31:17] well, if brother Marvin doesn't have the
[2:31:19] quote, I'm sure
[2:31:21] brother is reading it properly. You
[2:31:23] listen
[2:31:25] after that. Why? I thought if I could
[2:31:28] only get where these two men main men
[2:31:31] was that spoke in tongues and
[2:31:33] interpreted
[2:31:39] it was burning in my heart. I wanted it
[2:31:42] so bad.
[2:31:44] Well, as I've told you at the beginning,
[2:31:47] a little gift that you pull over,
[2:31:50] you know, gifts and callings are without
[2:31:52] repentance.
[2:31:55] You have them all your life.
[2:31:58] You are born with them.
[2:32:00] If if they are gifts of God,
[2:32:04] if you have a gift, it does not
[2:32:06] necessarily mean you are a very
[2:32:08] wellestablished brother or sister.
[2:32:14] It does not mean you are now mature
[2:32:16] spiritually.
[2:32:18] You can be gifted
[2:32:20] and still a baby in Christ.
[2:32:23] You are born with those gifts.
[2:32:27] I have children who can prophesy
[2:32:30] and things happen but they are babies
[2:32:34] both in Christ and in age
[2:32:37] you are born with them.
[2:32:40] That's what he says. But I thought if I
[2:32:43] could ever talk to them
[2:32:46] where the spirit that was in the
[2:32:47] building felt like it really was the
[2:32:49] spirit of God.
[2:32:54] So I got to talk to them
[2:32:56] and I asked to this man one of them a
[2:32:59] few questions
[2:33:02] and I found he was a real genuine
[2:33:04] Christian.
[2:33:07] There was no doubt about that.
[2:33:10] That man was a real believer
[2:33:14] saw a vision about him.
[2:33:17] He discerned him and he could see he's a
[2:33:20] true Christian.
[2:33:22] But he then he goes to the next man
[2:33:26] maybe the one who was interpreting
[2:33:29] or the one who had spoken to
[2:33:31] and the next man when I talked to him
[2:33:36] if I have ever met a hypocrite
[2:33:40] that was one of them
[2:33:43] and he had children two children by a
[2:33:46] blackheaded woman
[2:33:50] Yet his wife was a blondheaded woman.
[2:34:04] Are you following now? Okay. And I
[2:34:08] thought, well, now what?
[2:34:10] Here it is. I am all mixed up. I'm a
[2:34:13] fundamentalist. It must be the word or
[2:34:15] it is not right.
[2:34:24] reading this. Listen well. Don't
[2:34:25] disconnect.
[2:34:30] Stay connected.
[2:34:32] You know those who love the message will
[2:34:33] stay.
[2:34:36] All right. Here,
[2:34:39] brother Brham
[2:34:41] is talking about
[2:34:44] what he felt.
[2:34:48] He met one man,
[2:34:51] designed him and he saw he was a genuine
[2:34:57] one of the people who was speaking in
[2:34:58] tong
[2:35:00] and then he saw another one. He designed
[2:35:03] him and he saw he was a rascal.
[2:35:09] He is even an adouer.
[2:35:13] He said what?
[2:35:16] He by his gift he could see that
[2:35:20] and yet the people the words they were
[2:35:22] prophesying and interpreting were true
[2:35:23] we are right.
[2:35:27] So he he was confused.
[2:35:30] He was mixed up and he said for him he's
[2:35:32] a fundamentalist.
[2:35:35] It is either in the word or it is not.
[2:35:39] So he wanted to quickly dismiss their
[2:35:41] gifts.
[2:35:44] But I hear that spirit
[2:35:47] one rang out according to all I know
[2:35:49] genuine and the other one was not good
[2:35:51] at all. The spirit falling on both of
[2:35:53] them.
[2:35:59] How can that be?
[2:36:02] It had person.
[2:36:04] And I'm going to skip go to paragraph 16
[2:36:06] and I read you this. Now these real
[2:36:09] visions come without pulling into
[2:36:10] energy.
[2:36:14] He's now talking about how visions work.
[2:36:18] How many times, you know, my wife sees
[2:36:20] visions and I know she can just you can
[2:36:21] be talking there and then she begins to
[2:36:22] see a vision.
[2:36:25] He says
[2:36:28] a vision to see a vision. It just
[2:36:30] happens.
[2:36:32] And he says, I looked
[2:36:35] now in a vision
[2:36:37] and I saw the earth
[2:36:41] was turning out in front of me
[2:36:45] and I seen it was all disked up.
[2:36:52] There was a man dressed in white.
[2:36:56] He went around sowing wheat.
[2:37:00] And after he went around the cvature of
[2:37:02] the earth
[2:37:06] and around came a man
[2:37:09] looking horrible.
[2:37:12] He was dressed in black
[2:37:15] and he was throwing weeds
[2:37:21] all over the earth.
[2:37:23] If some people know how to do skits,
[2:37:28] believers, they would have done this
[2:37:29] into a ski.
[2:37:32] Very good. They both come up together.
[2:37:37] And they did. And when they did, they
[2:37:39] both was thirsty.
[2:37:44] All the seed both of them were thirsty.
[2:37:49] M and when they did because a rain was
[2:37:53] needed
[2:37:55] and each one looked like he was praying.
[2:37:58] [Music]
[2:38:00] They were all withered with his little
[2:38:02] head bent over.
[2:38:06] Lord
[2:38:08] send
[2:38:14] both those seeds,
[2:38:16] the weed seeds.
[2:38:20] and the wheat seats.
[2:38:23] If you're following, say amen.
[2:38:25] And the great clouds come up.
[2:38:28] This is still a vision.
[2:38:31] And a rain fell upon both of them.
[2:38:37] When it did, the little wheat jumped up
[2:38:42] and begin to say, "The little wheat,
[2:38:46] the the wheat, yes." and began to say,
[2:38:49] "Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord." And
[2:38:53] a little weed also.
[2:38:57] It jumped up right at the same side
[2:39:02] and said, "Praise the Lord. Praise the
[2:39:05] Lord."
[2:39:07] The wheat
[2:39:09] is praising the Lord.
[2:39:11] Brother Samuel and the wheat is also
[2:39:15] praising Lord.
[2:39:18] The wheat
[2:39:20] needed rain.
[2:39:23] The seed
[2:39:25] needed rain.
[2:39:28] Both of them prayed.
[2:39:31] They were thirsty for rain.
[2:39:34] Oh God, send your to send your
[2:39:36] anointing. Send it. They both praying.
[2:39:40] And God answered, "Heavens opened and a
[2:39:44] gush
[2:39:46] of the water.
[2:39:48] The spirit came down
[2:39:52] upon the wheat
[2:39:54] and upon the sea."
[2:39:57] The wheat
[2:39:59] jumped up and said, "Praise the Lord.
[2:40:03] Praise the Lord." The weed,
[2:40:08] the weed
[2:40:10] also jumped up at the same time on the
[2:40:15] side of the wheat
[2:40:17] and began also saying, "Praise the Lord.
[2:40:20] Praise the Lord."
[2:40:23] Are you following?
[2:40:26] Okay. It's like a teaching. So, you
[2:40:29] learn something here.
[2:40:31] And the great Okay. Now, let's let's
[2:40:32] let's follow down here. Now, and then
[2:40:35] the vision was interpreted.
[2:40:39] The rain falls on the just
[2:40:43] and the unjust.
[2:40:47] The same spirit can fall in a meeting
[2:40:52] and everybody rejoice in it.
[2:40:56] Hypocrites,
[2:40:58] Christians
[2:41:00] all together.
[2:41:02] Exactly. Right.
[2:41:04] If I see you dozing, I'm going to call
[2:41:06] out your name.
[2:41:08] And from the microphone, I'll tell you,
[2:41:09] brother, you are dozing.
[2:41:13] But what is it? You know, you know, let
[2:41:15] me first suppose
[2:41:19] brethren, stop.
[2:41:23] Stop oppressing the Holy Spirit.
[2:41:27] Please let us stop.
[2:41:30] We are the ones who force our ministers
[2:41:35] to to want to become the take it receive
[2:41:39] it.
[2:41:40] Our generation is spoiled.
[2:41:43] I'm telling the truth.
[2:41:46] If you go to a church and taking receive
[2:41:49] it, you can't even get any sleep that
[2:41:52] day. You will be jumping all over.
[2:41:56] You get it?
[2:41:58] But when we go into the depth, the real
[2:42:01] food, meat,
[2:42:04] we have to go into food. Let's get into
[2:42:06] the food.
[2:42:10] But when we start,
[2:42:12] some of you who don't feed on the word
[2:42:13] during the week,
[2:42:16] you get bored
[2:42:18] and you begin losing.
[2:42:22] We can know your spiritual level by
[2:42:23] that.
[2:42:27] Let us be a word church.
[2:42:30] Help me to preach the word.
[2:42:33] Enjoy the word.
[2:42:36] Amen.
[2:42:40] Don't worry. I'm not scing you. I'm
[2:42:42] speaking to you as your pastor. I love
[2:42:43] you.
[2:42:46] I want us to come and enjoy the word.
[2:42:51] Or else if you can't preach the word,
[2:42:55] and we enjoy it,
[2:42:57] then I'm going to give you food
[2:43:03] and and food will not make you grow as a
[2:43:05] son of God.
[2:43:10] Amen.
[2:43:13] How many of you are going to enjoy the
[2:43:14] word?
[2:43:16] God bless you. Tell me to go deeper
[2:43:20] by your receiving.
[2:43:23] All right, for sure I may not conclude
[2:43:26] today, but let me push on. And then a
[2:43:29] vision was interpreted.
[2:43:32] The rain falls on the just and the
[2:43:33] unjust.
[2:43:37] The same spirit can fall in a meeting
[2:43:40] and everybody rejoicing it.
[2:43:43] Hypocrites, Christians and all. Exactly
[2:43:47] right. But what is it?
[2:43:51] By their fruit you shall know them.
[2:43:56] That's the only way it can ever be
[2:43:58] known.
[2:44:01] We are in a day when we need to preach
[2:44:03] this.
[2:44:07] Wild wheat and grain sometimes
[2:44:10] impersonates a genuine domestic grain
[2:44:17] [Music]
[2:44:19] for clothes.
[2:44:20] that it would deceive the very elected.
[2:44:25] I think he says we are living in a
[2:44:27] timely age
[2:44:31] when these things should be preached on
[2:44:32] and talked about.
[2:44:36] Let me tell you something.
[2:44:39] William Brham was a great man of God.
[2:44:43] God used him. Everyone in the world
[2:44:45] agrees.
[2:44:47] All the preachers agree.
[2:44:50] They do not agree with him on the
[2:44:54] portion of the of the preaching of the
[2:44:55] word
[2:44:59] because whatever he told they disagreed
[2:45:02] with their theology
[2:45:06] but even the gift he had
[2:45:09] many have tried to impersonate
[2:45:13] until you have fought
[2:45:16] it was the same
[2:45:20] But let me tell you, none of them
[2:45:22] operated
[2:45:24] on the same level
[2:45:27] like him
[2:45:29] because he was a prophet of a
[2:45:30] generation.
[2:45:35] Then they will have hit and miss.
[2:45:39] Some of them are right,
[2:45:41] others are not right. You have seen it
[2:45:43] even in our generation.
[2:45:46] Someone will stand up and say,
[2:45:49] "Praise God. There is someone around
[2:45:52] here.
[2:45:56] Your name, your name is Joseph. Joseph,
[2:46:01] your name is
[2:46:03] Enoch."
[2:46:05] Of course, there are 10,000 people
[2:46:07] around you.
[2:46:09] [Music]
[2:46:11] Enoch will come running. I'm the one.
[2:46:16] Enoch,
[2:46:18] what the spirit of God is showing you.
[2:46:23] You You have I see three boys, two guys.
[2:46:27] Yes, my brothers are three. I have two
[2:46:29] sisters.
[2:46:32] So this man will be helping Dan to give
[2:46:34] the prophet.
[2:46:36] There is one I he said I see ABCD.
[2:46:40] Is it true? No.
[2:46:43] No prophet.
[2:46:45] Is it true?
[2:46:48] No prophet.
[2:46:53] You get a point.
[2:46:55] We have not
[2:46:58] come to a place
[2:47:01] try and impersonate.
[2:47:04] But we have the impersonators.
[2:47:09] God has genuine gifts.
[2:47:14] But you but every now now listen to
[2:47:16] this. Every gift that God has,
[2:47:22] it can be impersonated by Satan.
[2:47:28] There is no gift that God has that Satan
[2:47:33] cannot try to impersonate.
[2:47:37] So if you are going to be a person
[2:47:42] that will be driven
[2:47:44] by gifts,
[2:47:46] you are going to be misled.
[2:47:51] Why? You may be under feeling the wrong
[2:47:54] thing.
[2:47:57] thinking because this uh uh church is
[2:48:00] gifted,
[2:48:02] oh this prophet is gifted or that man of
[2:48:05] God is gifted.
[2:48:07] But we have we have been taught well
[2:48:10] and we have been showed here in the end
[2:48:13] time. We shall have faults
[2:48:17] anointed ones.
[2:48:22] The anointing sometimes is not false.
[2:48:27] But they themselves are found
[2:48:31] because they are not giving the people
[2:48:32] the word of truth.
[2:48:36] So we don't have the problem with the
[2:48:38] anointing.
[2:48:40] I am one person who respects the
[2:48:42] anointing no matter who has it.
[2:48:48] I have never felt intimidated.
[2:48:52] Oh because so and so
[2:48:55] They have anointing. No problem.
[2:48:58] Anointing can be anywhere
[2:49:01] because the rain falls
[2:49:04] on the just and the bad,
[2:49:07] on the good and the bad.
[2:49:10] It is God, the spirit of God, the
[2:49:13] anointing of God.
[2:49:15] Some pastors fear gifts in the church.
[2:49:19] They say gifts break the church.
[2:49:22] No, if the church is well founded on the
[2:49:24] word,
[2:49:27] gifts cannot break the church.
[2:49:31] If you are well taught,
[2:49:33] if you are you are founded on the
[2:49:35] principles of Christ, the word
[2:49:39] gifts will defy you not breaking.
[2:49:44] But where you find there's a little gift
[2:49:48] and everybody begins to follow
[2:49:51] and then when this person begins to feel
[2:49:54] oh I am needed I'm wanted then they
[2:49:57] begin to charge them. If you want to see
[2:49:59] the man of God
[2:50:02] being 100,000
[2:50:04] seed
[2:50:08] how can you see the man of God on empty
[2:50:10] hands.
[2:50:12] You see Is these things happening?
[2:50:18] It's what we have seen here.
[2:50:20] The the spirit of God will fall on the
[2:50:22] B.
[2:50:24] I'm trying to show you something where
[2:50:27] overcoming power is.
[2:50:29] You have to know who you are. You are
[2:50:32] not a tear.
[2:50:34] You are the seed of God.
[2:50:40] The seed will desire one thing.
[2:50:44] the word so that the word can activate
[2:50:50] so that the spirit can activate it.
[2:50:53] Before I even continue, let me show you
[2:50:55] something.
[2:50:56] When the spirit of God comes on the tear
[2:51:01] and comes on the wheat, they all rejoice
[2:51:05] under the anointing.
[2:51:08] They all grow under the anointing.
[2:51:12] Can you imagine that? They all grow,
[2:51:15] they all rejoice
[2:51:17] and they look alike.
[2:51:21] But there is a time sister
[2:51:24] when there is going to be a time of
[2:51:27] separation.
[2:51:30] Amen.
[2:51:32] That time is when we are going to know
[2:51:35] which one is the wheat,
[2:51:38] which one is the seed.
[2:51:42] Because the seed,
[2:51:46] the fruit
[2:51:47] will show
[2:51:49] the origin.
[2:51:52] Amen. The anointing, the spirit, the
[2:51:56] word will mature
[2:51:59] big plants.
[2:52:02] So as you are here listening to the
[2:52:04] word,
[2:52:06] you are maturing.
[2:52:09] Whatever is in you, you are maturing.
[2:52:13] That's why sometimes we have people in
[2:52:14] the church.
[2:52:17] The more they come, the more worse they
[2:52:19] become.
[2:52:22] Why? Because the seed in them is being
[2:52:26] Amen. is growing by the word.
[2:52:33] But but the word can never change the
[2:52:37] seed in you.
[2:52:45] The word can only mature what you are.
[2:52:52] The word can only manifest what is in
[2:52:55] you.
[2:52:57] That is why brother sister if you want
[2:53:00] to know who you are
[2:53:03] feed on the word every day of your life
[2:53:07] and then soon you will realize
[2:53:09] you are a child of God. You are a son of
[2:53:13] God and you will no longer be defeated
[2:53:16] by the demons which were defeated
[2:53:19] and then you will begin to overcome your
[2:53:21] problems.
[2:53:23] Why? Because now you are coming to
[2:53:26] maturity.
[2:53:30] Hallelujah.
[2:53:31] We want everybody to come to church. The
[2:53:34] only way you can know who you are
[2:53:37] is by coming to church and hear the
[2:53:39] word.
[2:53:42] I disagree
[2:53:45] with people who put restrictions on
[2:53:47] people who want to come to church.
[2:53:52] Don't come because you are not worthy.
[2:53:56] What is wrong with you?
[2:53:58] Church is for people who are wealthy and
[2:54:01] people who are unworthy.
[2:54:04] The word will manifest who they are.
[2:54:10] If their hair looks like it is going to
[2:54:12] fly away,
[2:54:15] let them come and see.
[2:54:19] You deacons,
[2:54:21] show them love.
[2:54:24] Don't show them attitude.
[2:54:26] or their hair looks like it is flying
[2:54:28] away
[2:54:30] because they have cut a certain style.
[2:54:33] Leave them. Let them come and see
[2:54:36] and let us preach the word.
[2:54:40] If this man is a s
[2:54:43] one day you will wake up and you will
[2:54:45] realize
[2:54:51] what happened. is maturing.
[2:54:55] Laws can never mature anyone.
[2:54:59] Laws make or produce hypocrites.
[2:55:06] We don't want a church that is a bunch
[2:55:08] of hypocrites.
[2:55:11] We want a church that is full of people
[2:55:13] who are on fire.
[2:55:16] Don't you worry about the others who are
[2:55:18] not the wit.
[2:55:21] They will walk away.
[2:55:23] Hallelujah.
[2:55:25] That's the best communication.
[2:55:29] They will walk away.
[2:55:32] Some of you who have worldly friends
[2:55:35] and you are so worried about chasing
[2:55:38] them from yourself.
[2:55:41] Don't worry about that. Love your
[2:55:44] worldly friends.
[2:55:46] And I mean it.
[2:55:49] If they are few friends already,
[2:55:52] keep loving them the best way you know
[2:55:53] how to.
[2:55:56] And the way while you are at it,
[2:55:59] bring them to church.
[2:56:02] Talk about your God.
[2:56:05] Do not bring down your principles
[2:56:07] because of them.
[2:56:11] If they are a seed, they will become
[2:56:14] hungry
[2:56:15] for what you have. If they are not, They
[2:56:19] will walk away from you by themselves.
[2:56:23] Hallelujah.
[2:56:26] Let me tell you, legalism
[2:56:32] is a seed for hypocrisy.
[2:56:36] [Music]
[2:56:37] And if you find many so-called
[2:56:40] Christians
[2:56:42] are hypocrites.
[2:56:44] But what do we need in place of
[2:56:48] we need people to come and sit
[2:56:53] under the power of the word.
[2:56:56] You may not even feel anything
[2:56:58] happening.
[2:57:00] The more you hear the word, the more
[2:57:03] something is happening in you.
[2:57:06] But the problem is the devil can't allow
[2:57:08] you to sit for so long under the water.
[2:57:12] You will walk away.
[2:57:14] You come, you walk, you walk.
[2:57:18] You don't come consecutively.
[2:57:20] You come to church religiously.
[2:57:24] You know, you come when you want.
[2:57:26] That's a problem.
[2:57:28] Be dedicated.
[2:57:30] These people who are borderline
[2:57:32] Christians,
[2:57:35] they will be the most sad when the
[2:57:36] rapture goes.
[2:57:41] They know so much in church.
[2:57:44] Not so much to reveal who they are.
[2:57:48] They know so much in the world.
[2:57:51] Not so much to become fully worldly.
[2:57:54] So they in the middle
[2:57:56] [Music]
[2:57:58] when the rapture happens.
[2:58:00] That's when they would say they would
[2:58:03] tell the rapture happen
[2:58:06] we are left behind. They will become the
[2:58:08] preachers in the tribulation.
[2:58:11] What is the rapture? They will begin
[2:58:13] explaining.
[2:58:18] The rapture is the catching away of the
[2:58:20] bride.
[2:58:22] So who is the bride? They have gone.
[2:58:26] What about you? How did you know this?
[2:58:29] How did you know?
[2:58:32] My friend, I also don't know. I thought
[2:58:36] I was the bride.
[2:58:38] But the problem is you you were pulling
[2:58:39] me
[2:58:41] and so I never really found out who I
[2:58:42] am.
[2:58:45] That's the problem why I'm here and
[2:58:47] that's why I know too much.
[2:58:49] And those people will begin with you.
[2:58:54] How come you knew and you never told us?
[2:58:58] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. It is
[2:59:01] very unfortunate child. If you have a
[2:59:04] sister, if you have a friend, if you
[2:59:07] have family that do not know what you
[2:59:09] believe,
[2:59:12] very unfortunate,
[2:59:15] very unfortunate.
[2:59:17] May God help you to leave this word.
[2:59:22] Now give me uh 10 more minutes
[2:59:26] and then I'll I'll break and then I'll
[2:59:28] continue on on Wednesday.
[2:59:30] Okay. I know after this now your
[2:59:32] concentration begins to reduce. All
[2:59:34] right. Uh I we continue with the with
[2:59:37] the with uh uh uh 19. Now notice in
[2:59:41] verse 41 the two are very close.
[2:59:46] so close in the last days still he
[2:59:48] didn't he couldn't he couldn't depend on
[2:59:51] some certain churches to separate them
[2:59:55] those two seeds those two
[3:00:00] the Methodist or the Baptist all the
[3:00:02] Pentecostals God now will no longer
[3:00:05] depend on these denominations to
[3:00:07] separate the sick
[3:00:17] These two seats
[3:00:20] in the framework of Christianity
[3:00:23] are so close,
[3:00:26] so
[3:00:29] that if it is possible,
[3:00:32] even the elect can be deceived.
[3:00:35] But I'm so glad the elect cannot be the
[3:00:38] same.
[3:00:40] It is impossible
[3:00:43] for the elect to be the seed. Who is the
[3:00:45] elect? Is the seed of God.
[3:00:49] Do I have the elect here?
[3:00:52] You are the elect. You can never be the
[3:00:56] same.
[3:00:58] Impossible. Which means you are the
[3:01:01] overcomer.
[3:01:04] If you are the overcomer,
[3:01:06] it means whatever situation around your
[3:01:10] life
[3:01:13] that you think is so bad
[3:01:16] until sometimes you have said how will I
[3:01:18] overcome it.
[3:01:21] Can you listen to thus sayaith the word?
[3:01:26] You will overcome it.
[3:01:29] You will overcome it.
[3:01:32] Not because I said so.
[3:01:34] Because I know there is overcoming power
[3:01:39] in the sea.
[3:01:42] Hallelujah.
[3:01:44] To them that overcome, they will sit
[3:01:46] with me on my side.
[3:01:49] Even as I overcame because Jesus
[3:01:52] overcame,
[3:01:53] the seed of God will overcome.
[3:01:57] Because Jesus never sinned.
[3:02:00] Amen. They that are born of God
[3:02:03] cannot see.
[3:02:06] Why? Because his seed
[3:02:10] remains in them.
[3:02:14] He said
[3:02:16] you know these two seeds will be too
[3:02:18] close
[3:02:21] until you will not know the true church
[3:02:22] and the false church.
[3:02:27] So what God has done
[3:02:30] is God cannot use the work of
[3:02:34] denominations to separate these two
[3:02:36] seats.
[3:02:41] He will not use the Methodist.
[3:02:43] He will not use the Baptist. He will not
[3:02:46] use the Pentecostals.
[3:02:47] He will not use any denomination
[3:02:50] to separate those seats.
[3:02:53] He said he sends his angels to separate
[3:02:56] them
[3:03:00] when in the end time
[3:03:03] when at harvest time.
[3:03:08] What time are we living in? We are at
[3:03:10] harvest time.
[3:03:13] We are in the season of harvest.
[3:03:16] We are no longer in the season of
[3:03:18] planting.
[3:03:20] We are no longer in the season of
[3:03:21] weeding.
[3:03:23] Oh brother, we are in a season of
[3:03:25] harvest.
[3:03:27] He's getting ready
[3:03:30] to come and take his bride away.
[3:03:33] His we bride.
[3:03:36] He's getting ready to come and cast us
[3:03:39] away to come and translate us to come
[3:03:43] and change us. What happened? send his
[3:03:47] angels
[3:03:49] separate us with a tears
[3:03:53] with a shock
[3:03:55] because the seed
[3:03:57] will be here with
[3:04:01] be a total separation.
[3:04:04] No more confusion,
[3:04:07] no more doubts and question
[3:04:11] come
[3:04:14] in every age.
[3:04:16] There is an angel.
[3:04:20] Hallelujah. Every
[3:04:23] God has said
[3:04:25] and that angel
[3:04:28] comes with a blade.
[3:04:33] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[3:04:36] he separates us,
[3:04:38] cuts us out from the others and
[3:04:42] separates us for what?
[3:04:46] for the
[3:04:49] for the rapture.
[3:04:52] You are the good seed.
[3:04:54] You must be taken into the
[3:04:57] Who is the angel of our generation.
[3:05:00] Hallelujah. The prophet of our age
[3:05:05] every age. a man of God
[3:05:10] with an anointing
[3:05:12] with a word
[3:05:14] who separates us from every denomination
[3:05:20] and he says come out of people.
[3:05:24] This is what we call the end time
[3:05:26] message.
[3:05:29] When we got separated,
[3:05:32] the first thing you do
[3:05:35] is to be baptized
[3:05:37] in much water in the name of the Lord
[3:05:40] Jesus Christ.
[3:05:42] If you have never done it, brother, you
[3:05:45] are not anywhere.
[3:05:47] Begin with that one. Get into the water.
[3:05:51] Get baptized in the name of our Lord
[3:05:54] Jesus Christ. And then something is
[3:05:56] about to happen to your life. It's a
[3:05:59] promise. He's going to fill you with the
[3:06:03] baption of the Holy Ghost. Now when you
[3:06:05] receive the Holy Ghost is a seal
[3:06:10] of God that he has said
[3:06:13] that this one is my finished product.
[3:06:19] This one I'm going to take him with me.
[3:06:23] So in other words, if you sealed
[3:06:25] container
[3:06:28] sealed with what? Sealed with the Holy
[3:06:31] Ghost containing what? Containing seed
[3:06:38] [Music]
[3:06:40] containing the seed of the word.
[3:06:43] If you are sealed,
[3:06:45] you are sealed until when?
[3:06:48] Until when?
[3:06:50] Until you do the next mistake.
[3:06:54] until the day of your redemption.
[3:07:00] It is sure, it is tested, you are going
[3:07:04] in the rapture.
[3:07:09] The moment you are sealed,
[3:07:12] it is sure, it is tested, you are going
[3:07:16] to overcome.
[3:07:22] I don't know what you're thinking right
[3:07:23] now,
[3:07:25] but I'm thinking about myself.
[3:07:27] It is sure. It is tested. I'm going in
[3:07:31] the rapture.
[3:07:33] It is sure. It is tested. I'm going to
[3:07:36] overcome. It is sure. It is tested. I am
[3:07:41] the seed. How do I know I am the seed? I
[3:07:44] have believed every word of God.
[3:07:49] Hallelujah.
[3:07:50] That's how we know who we are.
[3:07:53] When we believe every word of God.
[3:07:56] Hallelujah.
[3:07:57] Amen.
[3:07:58] Hallelujah.
[3:07:59] Hallelujah.
[3:08:00] Come on, say hallelujah.
[3:08:02] Hallelujah.
[3:08:05] Amen. Stand up on your feet.
[3:08:08] I ask you for 10 minutes.
[3:08:11] And I love being a man of my words,
[3:08:14] but there is much much more.
[3:08:18] There's much more in the word.
[3:08:21] There's much more in the word. A
[3:08:24] preacher can only preach for so long on
[3:08:25] Sunday morning.
[3:08:29] We have a limit.
[3:08:32] But I can tell you this
[3:08:35] brother, sister, you need time with the
[3:08:38] word.
[3:08:40] You need time in the presence of the
[3:08:42] Holy Spirit.
[3:08:45] Make time to come to church.
[3:08:49] God is preparing his bride.
[3:08:53] If you can't come to church,
[3:08:55] get online or somewhere archived
[3:08:57] services. Listen,
[3:09:02] don't just say, "Well, we not doing this
[3:09:04] for religious.
[3:09:08] God is fixing
[3:09:10] to take his waiting bride away.
[3:09:17] Are you one of them?
[3:09:20] If the Lord should come now,
[3:09:24] are you one of them?
[3:09:25] [Music]
[3:09:28] Are you ready for his coming?
[3:09:32] May God help us all
[3:09:35] to be ready
[3:09:38] for his coming.
[3:09:41] There's a lot very old song I want to
[3:09:43] sing.
[3:09:47] I don't know the number. If someone
[3:09:48] knows the number, brother Shalom, you
[3:09:50] can come and help me. Says, "When upon
[3:09:52] the clouds of heaven, Christ should
[3:09:58] which number is it?"
[3:10:00] Some people know those numbers of songs.
[3:10:05] Yes.
[3:10:06] 20.

[3:10:10] up on the screen for us. Yes. Number 20.
[3:10:16] I want you to listen to these words of
[3:10:18] this song.
[3:10:22] I remember we used to sing this song
[3:10:24] many years ago and
[3:10:27] we would meditate on these words.
[3:10:31] Very powerful words.
[3:10:35] And upon the clouds of heaven,
[3:10:41] Christ shall come
[3:10:44] to earth again.
[3:10:48] Will the world be glad to see him?

[3:11:26] shall come again,

[3:11:33] bring rejoicing?
[3:11:37] Oh, will we
[3:11:40] bring tears and pain? Are you ready? Are
[3:11:44] you ready
[3:11:47] to receive
[3:11:50] him? When our Lord
[3:11:54] shall come again, they'll be singing

[3:13:19] Jesus called you. Help to God
[3:13:24] [Music]
[3:13:25] in the grave.
[3:13:28] Now then with joy you will meet the
[3:13:33] Hallelujah.
[3:13:35] And when our Lord shall come, think
[3:13:40] about it now. There'll be singing,
[3:13:44] there'll be shouting,
[3:13:47] there'll be sorrow,

[3:14:21] weeping. They'll be praised.
[3:14:24] Amen. When the Lord
[3:14:27] shall come again.
[3:14:33] Amen. I don't know what you will be
[3:14:35] doing when the Lord comes again. My
[3:14:37] brother, my sister.
[3:14:41] I don't know how you are leaving your
[3:14:43] life now.
[3:14:45] [Music]
[3:14:47] I don't know whether you are getting
[3:14:50] ready for his coming.
[3:14:53] How is the status of your heart?
[3:14:58] Are you ready for his coming?
[3:15:02] Is your heart leaving as if he's coming
[3:15:03] in the next minute?
[3:15:07] [Music]
[3:15:08] Don't let anything be in your heart.
[3:15:12] Release yourself at all times
[3:15:16] in his presence
[3:15:18] and be ready for his coming.
[3:15:21] Because for sure we have talked about
[3:15:23] it, sung about it, lived it for years
[3:15:26] and years.
[3:15:28] Others have before us.
[3:15:32] But I can tell you we are in the harvest
[3:15:33] time.
[3:15:35] We are the people that are going to see
[3:15:37] this happen.
[3:15:39] Are you ready? Or you are still playing
[3:15:42] around
[3:15:43] playing around with the world
[3:15:47] with the desires of the world
[3:15:49] things of the world taking you away from
[3:15:51] his presence
[3:15:53] rather there's no time
[3:15:55] sister there is no time
[3:15:58] make your way
[3:16:00] in the presence of God
[3:16:03] that's where your hope and our hope is
[3:16:06] because we know when we are there
[3:16:10] we are ready for
[3:16:11] [Music]
[3:16:13] Oh, may God help us.
[3:16:17] May he give us the grace
[3:16:20] to understand who we are.
[3:16:26] Amen.
[3:16:28] Now I want to speak to you
[3:16:31] that the enemy maybe has told you that
[3:16:33] you cannot overcome.
[3:16:37] [Music]
[3:16:39] Have your head bowed now.
[3:16:44] The Lord, the enemy told you you cannot
[3:16:45] overcome.
[3:16:46] [Music]
[3:16:48] I'm here to speak to you in the name of
[3:16:51] Jesus Christ.
[3:16:54] The overcoming power
[3:16:57] is already in you.
[3:17:00] If you are here,
[3:17:03] desiring the word of God,
[3:17:06] desiring to do everything it says,
[3:17:11] you might be imperfect,
[3:17:15] but you love the world. You want to
[3:17:17] become what the word says.
[3:17:20] Let me tell you, don't listen to the
[3:17:22] devil.
[3:17:25] You are a seed.
[3:17:28] You are a seed.
[3:17:31] And the power to overcome
[3:17:34] is in the sea.
[3:17:37] You must overcome.
[3:17:39] The devil has nothing to do against you.
[3:17:43] Because even the scripture says,
[3:17:48] he that is in us
[3:17:51] is greater than he that is in us.
[3:17:55] Don't worry about the enemy that you're
[3:17:57] fighting with.
[3:18:02] Because he that is in you
[3:18:04] is greater than your enemy
[3:18:08] is greater than the flesh.
[3:18:10] It's greater than your doubts.
[3:18:13] It's greater than your fears.
[3:18:17] The sweet spirit, the sweet presence of
[3:18:19] of the Holy Spirit is here.
[3:18:23] not where I'm just standing
[3:18:26] all over this building
[3:18:30] and sweeping over you
[3:18:33] to confirm that these things I preached
[3:18:35] to you are truth.
[3:18:38] Would you yield to him?
[3:18:42] If you look at yourself,
[3:18:45] you don't see how you can be saved.
[3:18:48] But if you look at him,
[3:18:51] you should see that you can't be lost
[3:18:53] [Music]
[3:18:57] because he died and purchased
[3:19:00] your salvation on the cross.
[3:19:04] He paid a debt you could not pay.
[3:19:07] All you have to do is to yield to him.
[3:19:11] Say, "Sweet Holy Spirit.
[3:19:13] I know I've gone wayward many, many
[3:19:16] times.
[3:19:19] But here I am.
[3:19:21] Take a hold of me.
[3:19:24] Take a hold of me, Lord.
[3:19:26] Wash me in the blood of Jesus.
[3:19:29] Make me right with you, Lord.
[3:19:33] Give me overcoming power.
[3:19:36] The only way you can give it to you.
[3:19:38] It's revealed to you that what I've said
[3:19:41] is the truth.
[3:19:43] And that seed of God is in you.
[3:19:46] There is no way you can be lost.
[3:19:49] There is no way. Absolutely.
[3:19:56] Hallelujah.
[3:19:57] Hallelujah.
[3:20:00] Oh, thank you Lord Jesus.
[3:20:03] Thank you for your grace.
[3:20:06] Everybody just speak to him now. Lift up
[3:20:08] your hands.
[3:20:11] Speak to him.
[3:20:13] Tell him how you feel.
[3:20:19] Speak to him for he knows and he
[3:20:20] understands.
[3:20:25] He knows and he understands.
[3:20:28] He cares.
[3:20:31] Even if no one would care, but he cares.
[3:20:37] You are a human being and you have many
[3:20:38] times found in many mysteries.
[3:20:40] [Music]
[3:20:43] But if you're willing to change your
[3:20:44] way,
[3:20:46] to walk away from the world
[3:20:49] and come back to him, I tell you, he
[3:20:52] surely cares.
[3:20:54] You have to learn to care also.
[3:20:58] Say, Lord, because you care.
[3:21:01] Here I am also, Lord.
[3:21:04] take control of my life.
[3:21:06] I give my life to you
[3:21:10] that you will come
[3:21:12] and use me.
[3:21:16] Hallelujah.
[3:21:18] Hallelujah.
[3:21:31] [Music]
[3:23:00] Amen.
[3:23:03] The lost are
[3:23:08] find their way
[3:23:13] at the sound
[3:23:17] of your great name.
[3:23:22] All condemned,
[3:23:27] feel no shame
[3:23:29] [Music]
[3:23:31] at a sound
[3:23:35] of your great name.
[3:23:40] Every fear
[3:23:44] has no place
[3:23:48] at a sound
