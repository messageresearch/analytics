[1:39:51] amen praise God
[1:39:55] amen just have SE for just a
[1:40:08] moment amen I was just about to announce
[1:40:12] a few people who contacted me and say
[1:40:15] that they were not able to
[1:40:17] [Music]
[1:40:19] come one of them is
[1:40:23] I was happy to see her walking
[1:40:27] in I was told that grandchild I don't
[1:40:30] know she the
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:33] one she was
[1:40:35] sick to go to the
[1:40:38] hospital but it's good that the Lord has
[1:40:40] been I told her I pray that God would
[1:40:42] help you to make
[1:40:45] it amen and sister Joan and is doing
[1:40:50] exams the University
[1:40:53] also Peter
[1:40:55] same please requested the church to
[1:40:58] remember
[1:41:00] them
[1:41:01] amen the one of the children of Brother
[1:41:04] Martin also contracted a
[1:41:10] disease and cont I think it's
[1:41:15] called yeah your are fine now yeah
[1:41:19] they're doing better at first it was
[1:41:21] those of brother Henry
[1:41:26] so um sister Winnie and the children are
[1:41:29] not able to make it this morning because
[1:41:32] of Amen two more things I want to speak
[1:41:35] on before we open the
[1:41:39] scriptures I wanted to I informed you
[1:41:42] already but I wanted to now announce
[1:41:43] that we are starting our uh radio
[1:41:51] program the Lord of course laid it on my
[1:41:53] heart some several months
[1:41:56] ago I was supposed to begin in
[1:42:00] January but somehow uh we've been quite
[1:42:03] busy with other
[1:42:06] things and um so I think this is the
[1:42:11] time um we were able to I was initially
[1:42:16] going to start at is
[1:42:21] it and then before we concluded our uh
[1:42:26] talks with the
[1:42:30] station I saw the announcement that
[1:42:42] uh but my desire was to minister in
[1:42:48] English because of several reasons
[1:42:53] um although I I learned that English
[1:42:56] programs are more expensive than local
[1:42:58] programs slightly more
[1:43:03] expensive uh but nonetheless we are long
[1:43:06] story short we are going to start a
[1:43:08] program at Radio Uganda what you call
[1:43:13] UBC is the national
[1:43:16] station and we will be doing uh I think
[1:43:19] it's called UBC red UBC red
[1:43:23] it's it it goes all across the
[1:43:29] central all
[1:43:32] Eastern all
[1:43:34] North including
[1:43:37] West uh so it has a a wide
[1:43:42] coverage it does not go to the
[1:43:46] West I think there's a lot of work
[1:43:48] already done in the
[1:43:51] west uh it's not enough but I'm sure
[1:43:55] that it's already brothers who are
[1:43:56] evangelizing in that area even on
[1:44:00] radio so God has not led us towards the
[1:44:03] direction
[1:44:05] here but I feel there is quite little
[1:44:07] more work that needs to be
[1:44:10] done spreading this truth this
[1:44:14] message to uh those
[1:44:18] areas um will you pray over this
[1:44:21] pram so uh it will cost us a total of
[1:44:24] 800,000 a
[1:44:27] month for just 15 minutes every
[1:44:32] program four times a
[1:44:35] week Sunday morning um we were supposed
[1:44:38] to begin this Sunday but we sent in the
[1:44:41] recordings a bit
[1:44:46] late informed that we will begin the
[1:44:49] program will begin airing next Sunday
[1:44:55] so
[1:44:59] 7:45 in the morning on
[1:45:01] Sunday up to 8 so that is the
[1:45:05] arrangement so I'd like you to remember
[1:45:08] that in
[1:45:09] prayer but also you can partner with
[1:45:13] us I want Partners who are
[1:45:18] consistent you you come and tell us
[1:45:21] Pastor I have a burden to partner in
[1:45:23] this radio
[1:45:25] program and I'm going to be giving
[1:45:27] 100,000 every
[1:45:29] month
[1:45:30] 200,000 whatever much you can be able
[1:45:33] to even
[1:45:36] 10,000 even five but I want serious
[1:45:40] consistent
[1:45:44] partner because even what God starts
[1:45:46] does
[1:45:49] not yeah I meant he finishes
[1:45:53] does not leave it in the
[1:45:54] middle so if you want a continuous
[1:45:59] blessing come and partner with us
[1:46:03] continue There is no one with a
[1:46:05] responsibility it is you it is us with a
[1:46:09] responsibility those before us did their
[1:46:13] part it is now our part our time do our
[1:46:18] part there is no one who is going to
[1:46:20] evangelize Uganda with this message
[1:46:24] I know we've gone on the streets andiz
[1:46:26] on the
[1:46:27] streets and that will
[1:46:30] continue but I feel that this radio
[1:46:33] broadcast covers a
[1:46:36] bigger
[1:46:39] area and many are able to hear
[1:46:43] that so if you can't
[1:46:45] go and do it let your money go there for
[1:46:50] you amen and God will bless you for that
[1:46:54] and we have believed God here for great
[1:46:58] things we have believed God for those
[1:47:00] who are jobless to get
[1:47:02] jobs and I'm seeing that God is already
[1:47:04] doing
[1:47:06] it uh imagine um brother brother Andrew
[1:47:11] it's not only marriage that did it
[1:47:13] although that's part of
[1:47:16] it but also you are giving yourself to
[1:47:20] the service of God
[1:47:23] imagine someone struggling the whole
[1:47:25] youth meetings is running up and down
[1:47:27] and he does this is one of the people
[1:47:29] who are not
[1:47:31] sleeping and a few several others as
[1:47:33] well God sees you God sees your giving
[1:47:37] and what you
[1:47:39] do to to the to his service and I tell
[1:47:42] you nothing can go unpaid or
[1:47:46] unrewarded sometimes you may be an
[1:47:48] unsung hero and we never talk about what
[1:47:50] you do
[1:47:54] yeah the works you do the things
[1:47:57] you but God sees it God sees it and
[1:48:01] imagine a brother running up and down
[1:48:03] the whole time very
[1:48:05] tired and on the last last
[1:48:09] minute when he's when the youth meetings
[1:48:11] are
[1:48:13] concluded is invited to go and do an
[1:48:16] aptitude
[1:48:17] test that's not easy sever have done it
[1:48:20] and I've failed even after practice and
[1:48:23] and you know trying to prepare
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:26] themselves but he went and passed it
[1:48:29] with
[1:48:30] fly why because he had already prepared
[1:48:33] himself by giving himself and serving
[1:48:38] God and then here he he goes and is in
[1:48:42] the perfect will of
[1:48:46] God is in hison is a perfect will of
[1:48:50] God he was not running around with
[1:48:54] God imag if he was coming out of sin and
[1:48:57] then he received that
[1:49:00] message he would have failed
[1:49:02] terribly but he was in the perfect will
[1:49:04] of
[1:49:06] God and and you know come and get how do
[1:49:10] you know to put on your phone at that
[1:49:14] moment it was not a
[1:49:16] coincidence it must have been the angel
[1:49:18] of the Lord who came and told
[1:49:20] you switch on your phone now
[1:49:23] and he gave you
[1:49:26] allance my
[1:49:30] God we need to serve God if you serve
[1:49:33] him you can he cannot fail you and then
[1:49:37] our brother is here to give a
[1:49:40] testimony that the lord gave him the
[1:49:43] job and just like our brother Joel also
[1:49:45] give the
[1:49:47] testimony and all those who want jobs
[1:49:50] who want better jobs
[1:49:53] just receive it and believe it amen and
[1:49:56] when you get it don't disappear from
[1:50:00] church come and continually serve
[1:50:04] God I can almost tell you if you get a
[1:50:08] job and it makes you disappear from the
[1:50:10] presence of
[1:50:11] God it did not come from
[1:50:15] God I'm not going to apologize for
[1:50:18] that whatever job God gives you
[1:50:22] will make you stay in his
[1:50:26] presence if if you know you are in the
[1:50:28] perfect will
[1:50:30] of the perfect will of God cannot take
[1:50:32] you out of the
[1:50:35] presence so we don't want people who are
[1:50:38] lazy not working saying they always in
[1:50:43] prayer seven days a week no we don't
[1:50:46] want that but you also don't want people
[1:50:49] who are
[1:50:50] busy too busy to be in the presence of
[1:50:55] God we don't want that
[1:50:57] too you know David prayed he said let me
[1:51:01] not be
[1:51:02] poor so I don't ashame you and I
[1:51:05] don't but also let me not be so
[1:51:09] rich that I forget you so that's that
[1:51:12] should be your
[1:51:14] prayer whatever comes from God should
[1:51:17] make you serve
[1:51:18] him and one of the things we were asking
[1:51:21] God to give us jobs and
[1:51:26] incomes was because of the land fund
[1:51:30] project now I have been told by the uh
[1:51:35] team
[1:51:36] leaders that many of our church
[1:51:41] members are becoming dant on the
[1:51:43] WhatsApp groups which were
[1:51:47] formed uh the team leaders sent a
[1:51:49] message
[1:51:52] and you keep
[1:51:54] quiet that's what I've been
[1:51:57] told you you keep
[1:52:00] quiet Brethren God bless you we
[1:52:04] beginning our
[1:52:07] contributions brethren we should be
[1:52:09] ashamed of
[1:52:11] ourselves that is not
[1:52:14] good this is our
[1:52:17] responsibility your tell your neighbor
[1:52:19] it is your respons
[1:52:22] if you're muting other WhatsApp groups
[1:52:24] go
[1:52:27] ahead but the one of the land fund
[1:52:29] should never be
[1:52:32] muted keep it there even if you don't
[1:52:34] have money keep it
[1:52:36] there and you can never say you don't
[1:52:38] have
[1:52:39] money you just don't have what you want
[1:52:41] to
[1:52:43] give but you can give what you
[1:52:48] have how will
[1:52:51] me a man with Des eyes to give
[1:52:56] 5K a beautiful girl like to give 10 it
[1:53:01] doesn't
[1:53:03] matter 2000 give it
[1:53:07] there let the team leaders record and
[1:53:10] then the other thing if a team leader is
[1:53:13] complaining that the people are not
[1:53:18] giving one of the reasons could
[1:53:21] be that you are not being an
[1:53:25] example you know in our
[1:53:28] team which I am a part
[1:53:35] of in ouram he wants to bring himself in
[1:53:38] my team in my
[1:53:39] team you our team leader
[1:53:43] always she's number
[1:53:46] one when she's telling us let us
[1:53:49] contribute she says she brings the list
[1:53:53] number one number two number 20
[1:53:55] 30 but she's number one on the list and
[1:53:58] she's putting how much she has
[1:54:00] given so that's how a leader
[1:54:04] leads show the way show them the
[1:54:08] way and I know many of you team leaders
[1:54:11] are doing
[1:54:12] it and like I said God sees
[1:54:16] that you know keep doing it and um to
[1:54:20] you who have been silent
[1:54:22] you're bringing down our
[1:54:27] contributions and by the way uh I think
[1:54:29] you forgot to read the overall
[1:54:32] amount the total he gave us was only for
[1:54:35] the 24
[1:54:39] weeks 20 something
[1:54:42] Millions at the end of the service I'll
[1:54:44] give you another
[1:54:47] announcement regarding that but for now

[1:54:56] team

[1:56:46] Henry father we are standing before

[1:57:41] them Father we are yielding
[1:57:44] ourselves we ask that you will have your
[1:57:46] way in Jesus name amen
[1:57:50] amen John 16 for God so loved the world
[1:57:54] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:57:56] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:57:59] perish but have everlasting
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:13] life for go for God sent not his son
[1:58:16] into the world to condemn the world but
[1:58:19] that the world through him might be
[1:58:21] saved
[1:58:30] he that believeth on him is not
[1:58:33] condemned let me read that again and
[1:58:35] listen to me while I read it again he
[1:58:37] that believeth on him is not condemned
[1:58:41] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:58:45] already because he has not believed in
[1:58:48] the name of the only begotten son of God
[1:59:04] and this is the condemnation that light
[1:59:07] is come into the world and the men love
[1:59:09] Darkness rather than the light because
[1:59:12] their deeds were evil
[1:59:24] for everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[1:59:28] light neither cometh to the light lest
[1:59:31] his deeds should be
[1:59:43] reproved amen you may be seated
[1:59:47] please
[1:59:50] um today I'm speaking to you on the

[2:00:53] God to grow Also

[2:01:41] name of the
[2:01:43] Lord Amen brother Brian I always love
[2:01:45] you amen it should be the
[2:01:49] biggest the other time
[2:01:52] I spoke on I think it was on a
[2:01:55] wenesday what Resurrection will you be a
[2:01:57] part
[2:02:01] of and um many people told me they were
[2:02:05] blessed but also a few questions came
[2:02:08] out of it as a
[2:02:10] reason because I I did say that there
[2:02:13] are some there are others who will get
[2:02:15] eternal
[2:02:17] life who were previously not the bride
[2:02:21] [Music]
[2:02:24] so this morning I want us to kind of
[2:02:26] maybe learn a little
[2:02:27] bit uh more of the scriptures on on this
[2:02:34] subject and so be ready to delve into
[2:02:36] the scriptures and
[2:02:38] the so put on your spiritual thinking
[2:02:44] caps amen so because you see God gives
[2:02:48] eternal
[2:02:49] life but eternal life
[2:02:53] it is God's prerogative to give
[2:02:56] it do you believe
[2:02:59] that before the
[2:03:02] fall man who was
[2:03:05] eternal okay man who was
[2:03:08] a let that s man
[2:03:13] was there was
[2:03:15] God there was man and there was the
[2:03:19] creation Now God is
[2:03:23] eternal but before Man was
[2:03:26] created God created the Angelic
[2:03:31] being these Angelic
[2:03:34] beings were also I should say
[2:03:37] supernatural
[2:03:40] beings the reason they were
[2:03:43] created was to
[2:03:46] worship okay now that's why if you read
[2:03:49] in the Book of Genesis 1
[2:03:52] the Bible says in the beginning was uh
[2:03:55] in the beginning was God sorry in the
[2:03:57] beginning God
[2:04:00] created the Heaven and the
[2:04:02] Earth what does the word God
[2:04:06] mean the word god
[2:04:08] means the object of
[2:04:12] worship so now it means God was already
[2:04:15] being
[2:04:17] worship this Elohim this eternal being
[2:04:22] the one who was
[2:04:25] self-existent had now created
[2:04:28] beings that were already worshiping him
[2:04:30] day and
[2:04:32] night and that's why here he says in the
[2:04:35] very first verse he was already
[2:04:38] God but there was a
[2:04:41] time God was not
[2:04:44] God you cannot hear any theology saying
[2:04:49] that but our Prophet said that
[2:04:52] there was a time God was not
[2:04:55] God there was a time he was not
[2:04:59] worshiping but then when he created
[2:05:02] beings to
[2:05:04] worship he became God and then he was
[2:05:07] being
[2:05:08] worshiped but you see he had created
[2:05:11] everything all the angels and everything
[2:05:13] on
[2:05:15] Earth but he never did have anything in
[2:05:18] His image
[2:05:22] in his
[2:05:23] likeness so in Genesis 1 verse
[2:05:27] 20 he says let us create
[2:05:31] man in our own IM and the Bible says so
[2:05:36] God created man in his own
[2:05:41] image so now man when he was created by
[2:05:45] God before the
[2:05:47] fall he was eternal
[2:05:51] like God was
[2:05:53] eternal he was all
[2:05:55] powerful like God was all
[2:05:58] powerful he was a
[2:06:00] Creator like God was a
[2:06:02] Creator do you understand what I'm
[2:06:04] saying he was in the image of
[2:06:07] God he was a spirit even as God was a
[2:06:12] spirit everything God
[2:06:15] was Adam
[2:06:17] was amen and man was like they have too
[2:06:20] much sterio here brother and man was
[2:06:22] like God on
[2:06:25] Earth and he enjoyed eternal
[2:06:29] life are you following me now I want you
[2:06:32] to keep your thoughts together here
[2:06:34] praise God man was a CO creator with
[2:06:39] God he was supposed to
[2:06:43] multiply not to reproduce
[2:06:53] he you will get it he was supposed to
[2:06:59] multiply not to
[2:07:07] reproduce amen I don't know if in makes
[2:07:10] sense to you you know
[2:07:13] reproduction would come in later
[2:07:16] on as a result of a can knowledge of a
[2:07:20] man and a woman
[2:07:25] and that the Bible would say we are born
[2:07:30] in
[2:07:31] sin we are not born in
[2:07:34] sin because we um uh you know
[2:07:39] we we we did something
[2:07:42] bad we are born in
[2:07:44] sin because of the way we were
[2:07:49] born our father and our mother
[2:07:53] meeting in in in in the acts they
[2:07:57] did I should say the last full acts of
[2:08:00] their flesh the desires of the
[2:08:04] Flesh and out of
[2:08:06] that came
[2:08:09] people we were born in
[2:08:13] sin man was not supposed to give birth
[2:08:16] like
[2:08:17] that because remember man was like God
[2:08:22] man was supposed to give birth like
[2:08:25] God how did God give birth to
[2:08:29] ad God spoke the
[2:08:31] word amen and man was so Adam was
[2:08:36] supposed to give birth like
[2:08:39] God by speaking the
[2:08:42] word and then and then Eve give
[2:08:46] birth but but when the enemy came
[2:08:49] in everything change and you tell me
[2:08:53] Pastor how is that even
[2:08:55] possible that is exactly what happened
[2:08:58] later as we shall
[2:09:00] see you see he was supposed to
[2:09:03] multiply and fill the Earth by the power
[2:09:07] of the spoken
[2:09:10] word like God but after the
[2:09:14] fall man died man was eternally
[2:09:18] separated from God
[2:09:21] he no longer had access to the life or
[2:09:24] the Tree of
[2:09:26] Life the Tree of Life Is God
[2:09:30] himself he is only God that is the
[2:09:32] source of
[2:09:36] life it is God's life we don't have
[2:09:40] another source of
[2:09:42] Life Satan can't give
[2:09:45] life that is even why when a prostitute
[2:09:48] has a
[2:09:50] baby she says God has given me a
[2:09:53] child and it is
[2:09:56] true when when Eve gave bir to Cain she
[2:10:01] said I've got a child from
[2:10:03] God but that child amen was gotten out
[2:10:07] of
[2:10:09] adultery but it was true even if Cain
[2:10:13] was not a son of
[2:10:15] Adam but Cain was given by
[2:10:18] God because all life comes from
[2:10:23] God is the only source of
[2:10:25] life even the Devil
[2:10:28] Himself his life it came from
[2:10:32] God do you understand
[2:10:35] God there is no life that did not come
[2:10:39] from God and that's what the Bible says
[2:10:43] do not fear Him who can destroy the
[2:10:48] body but cannot destroy the soul
[2:10:52] but he said fear Him who will destroy
[2:10:55] both who can destroy both the soul and
[2:10:57] the
[2:11:00] body praise God brother Dixon you need
[2:11:03] to go and help I'm really struggling
[2:11:05] with the sound I have too much stere you
[2:11:06] here and I I cannot I cannot seem to
[2:11:11] concentrate all
[2:11:13] right praise the name of the
[2:11:17] Lord you people need always to pray for
[2:11:19] the for the service
[2:11:22] because while we come here to fight the
[2:11:25] enemy he also always fights tries to
[2:11:28] find a way he will come through to
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:33] fight I want you to
[2:11:36] imagine that the enemy
[2:11:40] Satan himself the life that he has was
[2:11:45] given to him by God and it can be taken
[2:11:48] away by God
[2:11:51] so the life that you have was given by
[2:11:55] God all right now the sound is good just
[2:11:57] increase it now it can only also be
[2:11:59] taken
[2:12:00] [Music]
[2:12:01] away so now when when
[2:12:05] sickness you know when sin came in
[2:12:08] sickness
[2:12:10] pain it all came
[2:12:12] in man that was supposed to be in the
[2:12:15] image of
[2:12:17] God man that was supposed to have
[2:12:19] dominion
[2:12:21] over everything on
[2:12:23] Earth was now a total
[2:12:26] failure he became a total
[2:12:29] failure we later on see in the
[2:12:32] scripture that
[2:12:34] meth is the longest living
[2:12:37] man and he lived 969
[2:12:41] years me could not even live one day
[2:12:56] so death is total separation from
[2:13:00] God do you understand what this means
[2:13:03] this means the eternal
[2:13:05] life that man
[2:13:07] had that eternal life was taken away
[2:13:11] from him by sin when it came
[2:13:15] in you see but God promis Redemption
[2:13:21] Redemption is to be taken
[2:13:25] back in everything that you
[2:13:28] lost to be given back the glory that you
[2:13:31] love to be given back the life that
[2:13:35] you you know so God promise
[2:13:38] Redemption the devil thought he had
[2:13:41] got he had got Adam Adam the Son of God
[2:13:46] but the devil did not know that he was
[2:13:48] only a piece of what came out of God
[2:13:52] by the spoken
[2:13:54] word if God could create
[2:13:57] sat and he could
[2:13:59] create there is nothing that could go
[2:14:02] beyond what God can
[2:14:06] do are you following
[2:14:08] me when Satan fell from
[2:14:12] Glory he he fell with many angels
[2:14:16] with and he thought he would come down
[2:14:18] to the
[2:14:20] Earth and I will tell you why he came
[2:14:22] down because in heaven he thought he
[2:14:25] would take over but he could not take
[2:14:29] over who can stand before the
[2:14:33] king no one can no one will because he's
[2:14:38] the king of kings he the Lord of lords
[2:14:41] there is no one can go over and beyond
[2:14:44] our
[2:14:46] go and he was cast down here and he
[2:14:50] began dancing
[2:14:51] I am now going to get the human
[2:14:53] race and I will squeeze
[2:14:56] life out of them but he did not know
[2:15:00] that the sameone who cast him out of
[2:15:03] Heaven he gave them that
[2:15:06] life and when he took life out
[2:15:09] of do you know what God was getting
[2:15:14] ready to just
[2:15:16] begin when the devil thought he had
[2:15:19] won was just getting ready to just
[2:15:24] start amen praise the name of the
[2:15:29] Lord praise the name of the Lord you
[2:15:32] need to
[2:15:34] understand there are many things I want
[2:15:35] to
[2:15:36] say please pray for me that God will
[2:15:39] give us a good
[2:15:41] atmosphere for these things to come
[2:15:43] for you need to understand the ministry
[2:15:47] of Jesus
[2:15:49] Christ Jesus was more than a
[2:15:56] prophet he was more than a
[2:15:59] son he was more than a human
[2:16:02] being Jesus was God
[2:16:06] himself amen but what did he do how did
[2:16:09] he create
[2:16:10] Adam I ask you how did he create
[2:16:13] Adam by the spoken
[2:16:16] word so how did he create uh Jesus
[2:16:24] there was a woman who did not know any
[2:16:28] man amen and she was a virgin but God
[2:16:32] came down amen and spoke a word said
[2:16:36] thou shall be with a child amen you call
[2:16:40] his name Jesus said how will these
[2:16:43] things be he the power
[2:16:46] high will overshake
[2:16:51] and you will be pregnant with a child
[2:16:53] tell me how can science
[2:16:57] explain a woman becoming
[2:17:00] pregnant without being touched by a
[2:17:03] man that is beyond
[2:17:06] science that is beyond
[2:17:08] religion that is beyond
[2:17:11] theology amen that can only be explained
[2:17:13] by the
[2:17:15] Supernatural and if you don't believe in
[2:17:17] the
[2:17:19] Supernatural you cannot understand
[2:17:22] this you have to go beyond what you
[2:17:26] know that's why we have
[2:17:29] faith because Faith you believe in The
[2:17:33] Invisible Faith you believe in what you
[2:17:35] cannot
[2:17:37] see you believe it as if you
[2:17:39] possess when the angel told
[2:17:42] Mary Mary you are going to be with child
[2:17:46] she said but how will it be and the
[2:17:49] answer she received
[2:17:51] she could not understand
[2:17:54] it the answer she received she could not
[2:17:57] fom
[2:17:58] it she could not explain it but she
[2:18:02] believed it because the angel said the
[2:18:06] holy spirit
[2:18:08] will the power of of the one on high
[2:18:13] will
[2:18:16] overtake it just like that yes just like
[2:18:19] that who was
[2:18:21] it the same
[2:18:24] word the same word she
[2:18:27] had the word that created a child in a
[2:18:32] womb the same word she
[2:18:35] had is
[2:18:37] Jesus the same word she had is
[2:18:42] Jesus people didn't get
[2:18:44] that the word she
[2:18:46] had in her ears is Jesus the Bible says
[2:18:52] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:18:55] Word was with God and the Word was
[2:19:01] God so the word she
[2:19:03] had was Jesus because in verse 14 he
[2:19:08] says and the Word was made
[2:19:11] manifest was made manifest so the word
[2:19:16] came from
[2:19:17] Glory came anded down
[2:19:21] and was made
[2:19:23] manifest right in the womb
[2:19:25] ofy and Mary was caring the
[2:19:29] word who is the word the word is
[2:19:34] God and Mary was
[2:19:37] caring in her womb what was that it was
[2:19:42] the
[2:19:43] immortal being car by the
[2:19:47] M there is something I'm getting
[2:19:51] it was the immortal being Cared by
[2:19:55] theal can you understand
[2:19:58] that it was
[2:20:00] eternity right within
[2:20:04] Time Eternity came down and United with
[2:20:10] time in order to remove time and to take
[2:20:15] you who living in and take you back to
[2:20:23] when Jesus was
[2:20:24] born he said I came from
[2:20:27] God I came from eternity I come from God
[2:20:32] and I go back to
[2:20:34] God it doesn't mean there was another
[2:20:38] God means he was God he came from God he
[2:20:44] was gone and he's going
[2:20:47] back in the image he was in
[2:20:50] [Music]
[2:20:52] you are getting it now amen so now Jesus
[2:20:57] was the plan of
[2:20:58] God to reconcile us back
[2:21:02] again to redeem us back
[2:21:05] again to our place of
[2:21:10] Eternity he was that
[2:21:13] plan that's why the Bible calls him the
[2:21:17] son of God
[2:21:21] why because the first Son of
[2:21:24] God
[2:21:27] sinned the devil thought that when he
[2:21:30] kills the Son of God
[2:21:32] Adam he will finish
[2:21:34] everything the holy spirit is reminding
[2:21:36] me SC should read for
[2:21:38] you he could not kill the Son of
[2:21:43] God my God my God my god listen I like
[2:21:48] us to go in Corinthians
[2:21:52] where the Bible gives this
[2:21:55] distinction between the first and the
[2:21:57] second
[2:21:58] [Music]
[2:22:00] Adam in 1 Corinthians
[2:22:06] 55 okay we'll begin from verses
[2:22:10] uh all right we just go to 45 right away
[2:22:13] and so it is written the first man Adam
[2:22:16] was made a living Soul the last Adam was
[2:22:20] made a quickening
[2:22:29] spirit are you following
[2:22:32] me the first man
[2:22:34] Adam was made a living
[2:22:38] soul but the last
[2:22:40] Adam who is the last
[2:22:45] Adam
[2:22:49] know Jesus
[2:22:51] the second Adam was
[2:22:53] Jesus the first Adam was
[2:22:56] Adam the last Adam was
[2:22:59] Jesus the first Adam was made a living
[2:23:03] soul and we are from that
[2:23:06] Adam a living
[2:23:09] soul but the last Adam was made a
[2:23:13] quickening
[2:23:17] spirit sayange that a quickening spirit
[2:23:20] a quickening soul but a quicking
[2:23:25] spirit did you get that now do you know
[2:23:29] aing
[2:23:31] spirit amen is a spirit that gives
[2:23:34] life so Jesus was not a mere
[2:23:38] Soul Jesus was the quickening
[2:23:42] SP Jesus himself was the quickening
[2:23:47] power Jesus was the one that gives life
[2:23:52] that's why he said I am the way I am the
[2:23:55] truth I am this
[2:23:58] life no man come to the
[2:24:01] father but by
[2:24:04] me why because he was
[2:24:09] the how B that was not first which is
[2:24:13] spiritual but that which is natural and
[2:24:16] afterward that which is spiritual
[2:24:25] Hallelujah the first man is of the
[2:24:30] Earth the second
[2:24:32] man the second man is the Lord From
[2:24:41] Heaven if you understood it shout
[2:24:45] amen the first
[2:24:47] man is of the Earth
[2:24:52] but the second man the second man he did
[2:24:56] not say he came from
[2:24:57] heaven but he said the second man is the
[2:25:02] Lord From
[2:25:04] Heaven do you believe the
[2:25:07] Bible Jesus was the Lord From
[2:25:11] Heaven praise the name of the Lord
[2:25:14] that's why in Revelation
[2:25:16] 3:4 he say un the end of the L dist
[2:25:20] right these things sayth the
[2:25:23] amen the
[2:25:25] faithful the true
[2:25:27] witness he's a
[2:25:29] faithful he's amen of God he's a true
[2:25:34] witness he the
[2:25:36] beginning of the
[2:25:39] creation the
[2:25:41] beginning did you hear that I thought
[2:25:44] Adam was the beginning of the creation
[2:25:46] of let us create man in our image
[2:25:51] Adam lost that
[2:25:52] image and Adam lost the beginning of the
[2:25:57] creation every child Adam gave birth
[2:26:01] to was now a
[2:26:03] sinner it was no longer the creation of
[2:26:06] God what your mother and father gave
[2:26:09] birth
[2:26:10] to is not the image of
[2:26:12] God that image of God was
[2:26:15] lost long time ago when Adam and Eve
[2:26:20] that's why we have
[2:26:22] failure we have pain we have suffering
[2:26:26] we have diseases we have anger that's
[2:26:29] why we born
[2:26:30] last why because we are trapped in these
[2:26:34] bodies you know we born the bodies of
[2:26:38] sin these were not supposed to be our
[2:26:41] natural our real spiritual
[2:26:44] bodies the glory life because we lost
[2:26:50] image of
[2:26:51] God what is the image of God is a
[2:26:55] spiritual Supernatural Eternal
[2:27:01] image it is
[2:27:03] sinless it cannot suffer pain it cannot
[2:27:06] suffer
[2:27:07] sickness no it is perfect it is just
[2:27:11] like God
[2:27:12] himself and Adam was that when the devil
[2:27:16] came he thought he had finished the
[2:27:19] creation of God
[2:27:20] but God jumped you know you know jumped
[2:27:25] the
[2:27:26] devil and he went right here and created
[2:27:30] for
[2:27:31] himself another
[2:27:37] image praise the name of the Lord praise
[2:27:40] the name of the Lord praise the name of
[2:27:42] the
[2:27:43] Lord praise the name of the
[2:27:47] Lord I wanted to follow Clos
[2:27:53] the
[2:27:55] creation of God everybody the
[2:27:59] creation of God the
[2:28:02] creation of
[2:28:05] God Adam was that image was that Perfect
[2:28:11] Image when you see Adam you
[2:28:15] seen but
[2:28:18] Adam and the devil began
[2:28:21] I'm now possessing
[2:28:23] Adam and all his
[2:28:25] creation that's why you are born with
[2:28:27] things you don't
[2:28:29] want some of you are born with
[2:28:33] anger with
[2:28:36] envy and you are fighting it but it's
[2:28:38] not
[2:28:40] going some of you are fighting with
[2:28:43] lust and Christians are very good at
[2:28:45] hiding
[2:28:47] it Christians want to behave as if they
[2:28:49] have no
[2:28:52] problem but let me tell you says is the
[2:28:56] most sick body on
[2:29:00] Earth you see what is happening we are
[2:29:03] born with all those last fulfilling
[2:29:06] those desires the pride of the world and
[2:29:08] the pride of life and the lust of the
[2:29:10] eyes these things we are struggling
[2:29:14] with are you hearing me we are
[2:29:17] struggling with them we seem not to be
[2:29:20] to break out of
[2:29:22] them trying but
[2:29:24] not
[2:29:26] trying Paul said what when I want to
[2:29:29] do comes before me what is happening we
[2:29:34] are born in a backslid
[2:29:37] step we lost that Eternal
[2:29:41] touch we lost that Eternal you know
[2:29:47] creation and when the devil thought he
[2:29:49] had won
[2:29:51] you know right there at the
[2:29:54] beginning God already had
[2:29:56] prophesied and he prophesied and said to
[2:30:00] the
[2:30:01] woman praise the name of the Lord he
[2:30:04] said because you've done
[2:30:06] this The
[2:30:08] Serpent and you are create
[2:30:12] enmity the
[2:30:14] serent he said that you the child or
[2:30:19] rather let me let me read it properly so
[2:30:20] that I can be able to get the
[2:30:23] context right in
[2:30:26] Genesis if you can turn there with
[2:30:43] me praise God
[2:30:53] and I will put this is 3:15 and I'll put
[2:30:55] enemity between thee and the woman and
[2:30:57] between th seed and her
[2:31:07] seed and it shall Breeze thy head and
[2:31:11] thou shall breath his
[2:31:17] heel are you following me are you
[2:31:20] following me I'll put an enemity between
[2:31:22] thee and the
[2:31:24] woman now I want you to imagine this the
[2:31:28] Bible here is giving God rather is
[2:31:31] giving a
[2:31:32] prophecy and the devil was not
[2:31:35] understanding what God was talking
[2:31:38] about God was speaking in secret in
[2:31:43] Mysteries when he said I'll put an
[2:31:46] between you and the
[2:31:47] woman and your seed and her
[2:31:51] in here follow me closely we able to see
[2:31:56] that the serpent has a
[2:31:59] seed everybody tell your neighbor the
[2:32:01] serpent has a
[2:32:04] seed all right and the woman has a seed
[2:32:08] okay now the woman can't have a
[2:32:10] seed naturally speaking so the seed of
[2:32:13] the woman here is talking about a
[2:32:17] child a boy
[2:32:20] a human being that would be born by a
[2:32:23] woman without being touched by a
[2:32:27] man are you following me has that ever
[2:32:31] happened in human
[2:32:33] history before then no it can never
[2:32:36] happen so there is no way the devil
[2:32:39] could understand what God was
[2:32:43] meaning it was a mystery so that Satan
[2:32:47] has a
[2:32:48] SE and even today we have serpent seed
[2:32:51] on
[2:32:53] Earth did you know that I don't know
[2:32:57] whether we have some
[2:32:58] here I hope we
[2:33:02] don't yes serpent seed is on
[2:33:06] Earth those ones they will never believe
[2:33:09] the word no matter what you
[2:33:11] do you get a hmer and
[2:33:14] Hammer they will never
[2:33:17] accept serp seed
[2:33:21] no matter how the preacher is or how
[2:33:23] good he
[2:33:24] is they will never
[2:33:26] change one day God himself came down
[2:33:30] and that was Kan he said but if you do
[2:33:34] well won I receive you was I accept did
[2:33:38] Kan

[2:34:24] Ser I believe you can be
[2:34:28] change because you are a seed of
[2:34:32] God Amen
[2:34:35] Hallelujah I told you I have a lot to
[2:34:37] cover
[2:34:39] tonight if you give me time and and your
[2:34:42] attentiveness and and you open your
[2:34:45] heart I believe you we in for something
[2:34:48] wonderful
[2:34:50] so see now here is a
[2:34:54] prophecy where he says um I will put an
[2:34:58] between your seed and her
[2:35:01] seed and it shall breathe thy
[2:35:04] head who the seed of the woman will bre
[2:35:08] the head of
[2:35:11] the and and and the seed of the serpent
[2:35:14] or the
[2:35:15] serpent will breee the heel
[2:35:20] of of the of the of the uh the heel of
[2:35:23] the uh of the seed of the
[2:35:26] woman when was that
[2:35:29] fulfilled that was
[2:35:31] fulfilled on the
[2:35:34] cross Jesus was the seed of the
[2:35:38] woman tell your neighbor Jesus was the
[2:35:40] seed of
[2:35:42] the and the serpent breed his
[2:35:48] heal by casting him on the cross and
[2:35:51] beating him piercing his side Anda him
[2:35:54] up and killing him breed his
[2:35:58] heal but that was just a little
[2:36:02] heal a heal does not
[2:36:05] kill if the devil wanted he could even
[2:36:07] cut
[2:36:09] it not just
[2:36:12] breathing it could not
[2:36:14] kill the devil thought he had killed
[2:36:17] Jesus when he he bred
[2:36:21] but he also did not know that Jesus was
[2:36:24] the promised seed of the
[2:36:27] woman who was
[2:36:29] prophesied to come and breathe the head
[2:36:31] of the
[2:36:33] serent and the moment heal of Jesus was
[2:36:38] bre
[2:36:40] the and he was in Hell
[2:36:43] celebrating throwing a
[2:36:45] party imagine all the demons there
[2:36:50] see saying we have won we have won and
[2:36:53] then they
[2:36:55] hear what was that it was the seed of
[2:36:58] the
[2:36:59] woman who had
[2:37:01] appeared right in the head quarters of
[2:37:05] hell and he had come to breathe the head
[2:37:10] of once and
[2:37:13] forever that's why when he died on the
[2:37:16] cross he said it is the f
[2:37:21] the devil did not
[2:37:22] understand what he meant
[2:37:26] BYU it was a mystery just like genesis
[2:37:30] 3:15 was a
[2:37:32] mystery it is finished was a
[2:37:35] mystery until he
[2:37:38] finally opened his eyes and he saw Jesus
[2:37:43] the Same Jesus he had killed he saw him
[2:37:46] in
[2:37:46] Hell calming down to bre the head of
[2:37:51] the to take
[2:37:53] over what had Jesus going to
[2:37:56] do oh listen to me church he had gone to
[2:38:01] set forth a new
[2:38:06] pattern everyone that was
[2:38:09] dying before that
[2:38:12] time going to hell
[2:38:22] even the
[2:38:23] Believers they were going
[2:38:26] to another compartment of
[2:38:30] Hell
[2:38:33] Paradise they were going there were
[2:38:37] there was a lock on the
[2:38:39] door they were in
[2:38:42] prison there were others in another
[2:38:45] compartment who were born unbelievers
[2:38:50] they were also locked
[2:38:51] there they were locked there I had a
[2:38:54] preacher the other
[2:38:56] time saying pcal preacher that
[2:39:00] paradise where the Believers go is in
[2:39:05] hell and I was like oh yeah that's true
[2:39:08] according to the old
[2:39:10] version so he's having the old version
[2:39:13] The
[2:39:14] Gospel but now listen to the new version
[2:39:17] of the
[2:39:17] message Hallelujah
[2:39:19] so now it is true they were in Hell
[2:39:23] locked up there and others were in
[2:39:26] Hell the The Souls of those who were
[2:39:30] nonbelievers chained
[2:39:32] there and there was hell
[2:39:35] itself the Throne of Satan
[2:39:38] itself so now when Jesus came the very
[2:39:41] first place he went
[2:39:43] to was the headquarters
[2:39:47] itself of the Devil Himself
[2:39:51] heu he went there to take over to take
[2:39:56] authority to
[2:39:58] ass his authority as the seed of the
[2:40:03] woman that was promised to
[2:40:06] come and when he arrived there he said
[2:40:09] I've come to take over and the prophet
[2:40:12] dramatized
[2:40:13] it he said he must have
[2:40:17] knocked and the devil asked all the
[2:40:20] are you here are you here and after he
[2:40:23] did the call all of them were around
[2:40:27] said now who Could That Be before he
[2:40:29] could know who it was Jesus B the door
[2:40:33] open and he came you know like those
[2:40:36] movies they used to act many years ago
[2:40:40] rainbow Jesus is our
[2:40:44] champion hallelujah hallelujah amen
[2:40:47] Jesus is our star
[2:40:50] he entered come to take
[2:40:54] over and when he came in the devil began
[2:40:58] Shing began string he said are you the
[2:41:01] one he said I am the one when he was
[2:41:04] saying are you the one the devil knew
[2:41:06] what he was talking about he now knew

[2:45:33] last of both those
[2:45:35] [Music]
[2:45:37] places one of them Jesus told him I'll
[2:45:41] meet you in
[2:45:42] Paradise the other
[2:45:45] one of course he went to help the other

[2:49:47] someone that you reading on in the
[2:49:50] books
[2:49:52] this and a
[2:50:04] moment and many people kept on saying
[2:50:07] appearing disappear disapp disappear
[2:50:12] they were living in another
[2:50:16] dimension and when they finished up
[2:50:19] they wrapped up
[2:50:20] everything and they went in another
[2:50:24] paradise they went in another paradise
[2:50:27] in Heavenly
[2:50:29] plac where they are until
[2:50:33] today one of these days hallelujah when
[2:50:38] a trumpet of God
[2:50:39] shall those people will rise again we
[2:50:43] will be changed and together with them
[2:50:46] we shall go and be with the Lord
[2:50:49] let me tell you this is a
[2:50:51] reality this is how the Rapture will
[2:50:55] be first Thessalonians
[2:50:59] 4 16 you can read it that's what it say
[2:51:03] praise the name of the Lord so you see
[2:51:06] these
[2:51:07] people had got eternal
[2:51:09] life back
[2:51:11] again Jesus from that day he instituted
[2:51:19] another
[2:51:22] Testament this
[2:51:24] testament which was sealed by his own
[2:51:28] [Music]
[2:51:31] blood that's why he's saying for God so
[2:51:36] L that he gave his only begotten
[2:51:40] son follow me closely he was a begotten
[2:51:44] son when the devil killed Adam the son
[2:51:48] of God the devil did not know that God
[2:51:53] who created Adam can create another
[2:51:59] son God said okay that's what you have
[2:52:02] done all right wait for
[2:52:04] me so God
[2:52:07] formed a body a
[2:52:10] son for
[2:52:12] himself Towell
[2:52:17] in the body was
[2:52:20] human spoken word of
[2:52:23] God it was spoken into
[2:52:25] existence the body was
[2:52:31] finite the body was a human
[2:52:35] being the body was just like you and
[2:52:39] me
[2:52:41] 100%
[2:52:44] man but God himself
[2:52:49] in this body this body was called the
[2:52:52] Son of
[2:52:53] God begotten by
[2:52:56] God by the spoken
[2:52:58] word and God
[2:53:02] himself came in him just like
[2:53:05] Adam when he breathed in
[2:53:09] him the Breath of Life Adam was perfect
[2:53:15] was eternal but when sin came
[2:53:18] to do it over
[2:53:20] again and here he created a body in the
[2:53:23] wom of a woman and God himself on the
[2:53:27] day of
[2:53:28] baptism he came right in that body and
[2:53:31] it was even spoken by the
[2:53:36] heavens this is my beloved
[2:53:40] Son in
[2:53:42] whom I'm well
[2:53:45] pleased so God declared
[2:53:48] by the heaven I am right inside
[2:53:54] this whatever he says I
[2:53:57] say whatever he BS i
[2:54:01] b whatever he creates I
[2:54:03] create he is the life I am the life he
[2:54:07] the I am and I am you understand
[2:54:11] whatever oh my God hallelujah whatever
[2:54:14] God spoke about himself in the Old
[2:54:17] Testament he spoke about
[2:54:20] Jesus because
[2:54:22] Jesus was the visible
[2:54:26] image of the invisible
[2:54:29] [Applause]
[2:54:34] God you understand that so Jesus was
[2:54:40] eternal Hallelujah in his
[2:54:44] Spirit he was God
[2:54:47] himself so why did he
[2:54:49] come God loved the
[2:54:52] world but he gave his only
[2:54:56] begotten
[2:54:58] whosoever believe in that son should not
[2:55:03] perish but have everlasting
[2:55:06] life Hallelujah now what is life life is
[2:55:12] God's
[2:55:13] life is eternal
[2:55:16] life he that believeth on him is not
[2:55:20] condemned follow me closely the one who
[2:55:23] believes in the
[2:55:25] son will not be
[2:55:29] condemned what is
[2:55:31] condemnation condemnation is you know on
[2:55:34] the day of
[2:55:39] judgment that's where the condemnation
[2:55:41] is but the Bible says here whosoever
[2:55:45] believeth on the
[2:55:46] son shall not be
[2:55:50] condemned so now you have to
[2:55:52] understand that we only can be able to
[2:55:55] receive
[2:56:01] Eternal in the Son of
[2:56:05] God who is he the
[2:56:10] word the ethopian
[2:56:15] UN he was working with Philip
[2:56:18] water and Philip asked him a question he
[2:56:21] said do you now believe said yeah I
[2:56:24] believe I want you to
[2:56:25] B he said ah if you believe with all
[2:56:28] your heart he said I believe that Jesus
[2:56:32] Christ is the Son of
[2:56:34] God meaning I believe that Jesus Christ
[2:56:39] is God in
[2:56:42] flesh said then I
[2:56:44] bapti and
[2:56:46] heaped and the says he that believes on
[2:56:52] him he that believeth not is condemned
[2:56:56] already because he that has not believed
[2:56:59] in the name of the only begotten son
[2:57:04] of and this is the
[2:57:07] condemnation the light is coming to the
[2:57:10] world and Men love
[2:57:13] Darkness rather than the light because
[2:57:16] their deeds were evil
[2:57:19] for everyone that doeth evil hurs the
[2:57:23] light neither comes to the
[2:57:26] light let his deeds be
[2:57:31] reproved praise the name of the Lord are
[2:57:34] you following church so Jesus fulfilled
[2:57:37] the
[2:57:38] prophecy her seed will breath the head
[2:57:41] of of the
[2:57:43] serpent he literally came to take the
[2:57:46] place of The Sinner
[2:57:49] he came to take the place of
[2:57:51] Adam and his Fallen
[2:57:54] rest Oh Glory to
[2:57:57] God he came and he took Adam's
[2:58:01] Place he was the
[2:58:04] new creation of
[2:58:09] God please understand
[2:58:12] it from the
[2:58:14] spirit here Adam was the first creator
[2:58:18] first Adam second Adam the first Adam
[2:58:23] the second
[2:58:23] Adam came to bring
[2:58:27] back everything the
[2:58:31] other to restore him to redeem him to
[2:58:36] bring him
[2:58:37] back to the
[2:58:39] image the Eternal image of
[2:58:43] God and so he literally took the place
[2:58:46] of Adam
[2:58:49] and by his work on the
[2:58:51] cross he fully restore The
[2:58:55] Sinner back to
[2:58:58] Eternity back to
[2:59:01] Eternity remember there was Ser
[2:59:06] too so now oh my God now you see today
[2:59:11] by the time Jesus came on
[2:59:13] Earth there were two
[2:59:15] seeds the seed of God
[2:59:19] and the SE of the
[2:59:20] serpent but he came to redeem all the
[2:59:26] redeemable but there was
[2:59:29] to so how can we separate
[2:59:33] them how can we say those ones who are
[2:59:37] from the family
[2:59:41] of can we say the white people or the
[2:59:44] people or the yellow
[2:59:47] people cannot do it that way because
[2:59:50] since the days of
[2:59:51] Noah we can no longer follow those
[2:59:56] Lage there was a mix
[2:59:59] up so every oh my God don't miss this
[3:00:04] everything has now been placed under one
[3:00:08] thing

[3:02:23] people and telling them
[3:02:25] lies about the issue of the women

[3:02:48] Deon must be a married man with one
[3:02:52] wife how many say I

[3:02:58] double tonged
[3:03:00] man his wife must also be under
[3:03:03] subje we simp say
[3:03:06] Amen if you find if he says a bishop

[3:03:21] wife you divorce the other one divor
[3:03:23] other even if you divorce that should

[3:04:08] doeth righteousness is righteous and
[3:04:10] even as he is righteous he that commit
[3:04:12] sins of the devil for the devil sinth
[3:04:15] from the beginning
[3:04:36] for this purpose the Son of God was
[3:04:39] manifested that he might destroy the
[3:04:42] works
[3:04:43] of
[3:04:46] hell hell
[3:04:49] the Son of God was
[3:04:52] manifested now the Son of God is
[3:04:56] Jesus he was manifested to destroy the
[3:05:00] works of
[3:05:01] the but also he was
[3:05:04] manifested to manifest more sons of
[3:05:10] God I'll go ahead of
[3:05:13] myself first John 3:2 beloved now now
[3:05:17] are we the sons of
[3:05:20] God tell your neighbor I am a Son of
[3:05:25] God now if you're a Son of God you are

[3:06:28] devil and whosoever that is born of God
[3:06:31] does not commit
[3:06:34] sin for his SE remain in him and cannot

[3:06:47] whosoever does not
[3:06:50] righteousness is not of God nether he
[3:06:53] that loveth not

[3:07:30] the
[3:07:31] word to accept the
[3:07:33] word b into the kingdom of

[3:07:53] Jesus Abraham is our father Jesus sayi
[3:07:57] unto them if ye were Abraham's children

[3:08:49] Jesus brought the word he was the
[3:08:53] word and he came to these

[3:08:58] they rejected him they
[3:09:01] said Abraham is our father we don't know
[3:09:05] you Jesus said to them sincerely If
[3:09:09] Abraham is your
[3:09:10] father and you were his children you

[3:24:18] there is nothing I need to do to get
[3:24:21] eternal life I have already
[3:24:25] receive by
[3:24:27] faith in the Son of God the Son of God
[3:24:31] As I said is the word of
[3:24:35] truth that gives me eternal
[3:24:39] life and the people
[3:24:42] came that day they said s
[3:24:47] what must I do to be
[3:24:48] safe the prison
[3:24:51] God story what must you do said believe
[3:24:56] on the Lord Jesus
[3:25:01] CH by the way the easiest thing to
[3:25:06] do is to go in the
[3:25:10] Rapture Hallelujah because the
[3:25:13] Rapture it is not going to be on the
[3:25:15] basis of your many good on
[3:25:20] it is only on the basis of his good
[3:25:25] work the only thing you have to do is
[3:25:28] say I believe in
[3:25:31] it whatever I said he said I accept it
[3:25:35] don't debate with it even if you can't
[3:25:38] leave it
[3:25:40] yet you you you you you yielded
[3:25:43] yourself God I can't see this in me
[3:25:47] I believe it I want to see it in
[3:25:50] me you come here in prayer you come in
[3:25:53] fasting I want to see God's
[3:25:55] nature I want to see that
[3:25:58] life
[3:26:00] until but let me tell you brother as
[3:26:02] long as you believe every
[3:26:04] word you are sure you are coming in the
[3:26:08] resurrection you are coming in the fast
[3:26:12] resurrection and the Bible says blessed
[3:26:16] holy is
[3:26:17] he that comes in the first
[3:26:21] resurrection the second
[3:26:23] death has no power
[3:26:28] over the ones who go in the first
[3:26:32] resurrection are the ones who would have
[3:26:35] previously received eternal life by
[3:26:37] faith through
[3:26:44] Grace so other words received it Through
[3:26:46] the
[3:26:48] Ages God sent the
[3:26:51] messenger and they grabbed that word
[3:26:54] they believed in and on the basis of
[3:26:57] Faith they go in the
[3:27:00] Rapture tell me this is the easiest
[3:27:04] thing and that's why the devil tries to
[3:27:06] divert
[3:27:09] your he's trying to get many customers
[3:27:11] to take to
[3:27:13] help but brother
[3:27:17] keep coming to
[3:27:18] church because Faith Comes only by
[3:27:21] hearing the
[3:27:23] word amen amen what are we doing we are
[3:27:28] making working out our salvation with
[3:27:31] fear
[3:27:40] and and when the the trumpet
[3:27:42] sounds we will be there
[3:27:46] some people thought that they going to
[3:27:47] be surprised to see some people in the
[3:27:51] rupture no we are not going to be
[3:27:53] surprised no it's just like you're
[3:27:56] telling me we shall be surprised to see
[3:28:00] someone passing
[3:28:02] p7 we not studing with
[3:28:06] them no he has to
[3:28:10] study and prepare for
[3:28:13] exams if he doesn't he will fail
[3:28:18] right our preparation is ongoing
[3:28:21] Now by coming to church by hearing the
[3:28:25] word by yiing our to God and the more
[3:28:29] word we hear the more faith wece the
[3:28:33] more we hear the more Fai we receive in
[3:28:37] one of these days we shall receive
[3:28:41] rapturing and we will fly away
[3:28:46] but there going to be
[3:28:49] others who will get eternal
[3:28:53] life on the
[3:28:56] Judgment it will be the
[3:29:01] hardest the
[3:29:04] hardest I thought today I'll go through
[3:29:06] it but I see I don't have time
[3:29:09] to probably I'll do it on Sunday on
[3:29:13] Wednesday but see friends they are going
[3:29:15] to be
[3:29:17] others who will get eternal
[3:29:19] life on the Judgment
[3:29:22] Day who we are not part of the
[3:29:27] Bride but listen the only thing they
[3:29:30] will
[3:29:31] get is eternal life full
[3:29:35] stop but for us we receive eternal
[3:29:39] life by default here on
[3:29:43] Earth the rest is all the benefits of it
[3:29:49] we have many other
[3:29:51] benefits I can give you a few benefits
[3:29:53] here if I go ahead of
[3:29:56] myself praise the name of the Lord there
[3:29:59] is
[3:30:00] power power it's a
[3:30:03] benefit what is power power for what for
[3:30:06] healing for signs and wonders for gifts
[3:30:10] of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the
[3:30:12] genuine biblical
[3:30:14] ones there's another that this we get
[3:30:16] here on
[3:30:17] Earth all right but then also while we
[3:30:20] here on
[3:30:21] Earth listen we have another
[3:30:25] benefit that is reigning over
[3:30:29] sin because the Bible says we are Kings
[3:30:33] and we are
[3:30:34] priests you can see someone who is not
[3:30:37] going in the
[3:30:39] Rapture they claim to have eternal life
[3:30:42] but their life is a very def life
[3:30:46] they are living in
[3:30:47] sin they are living any like the worldly
[3:30:50] people they going to the parties of the
[3:30:53] world you find a brother sister
[3:30:55] sweating dancing with
[3:31:00] unbelievers you are so
[3:31:02] defeated and you are claiming going the
[3:31:04] Rapture not the Rapture I
[3:31:06] know you can't get that
[3:31:09] benefit because you already failed here
[3:31:11] it's a symbol you
[3:31:13] failed but there's another benefit of a
[3:31:17] Believer who has received eternal
[3:31:19] life they will live an overcoming life
[3:31:22] here on
[3:31:26] Earth you will live above
[3:31:29] sin is God a
[3:31:33] liar God said You shall be
[3:31:37] Kings and Priests a king is somebody who
[3:31:40] rules
[3:31:42] over you rule over sin you rule over
[3:31:48] poverty are you hearing me if you're
[3:31:52] poor don't accept it because you are a
[3:31:55] king you're supposed to rule over
[3:31:57] pover to rule over bad
[3:32:00] situation rule over witchcraft rule
[3:32:04] trouble
[3:32:05] suffering rule bad
[3:32:08] situations rule over bad
[3:32:10] thoughts rule over last you are supposed
[3:32:14] to be a king over this
[3:32:18] you supposed to rule over
[3:32:20] sickness did you know someone who has
[3:32:23] receive eternal
[3:32:25] life should not be
[3:32:29] sick am there it is for
[3:32:32] you I believe that with all my
[3:32:36] heart you should not be
[3:32:39] sick because before the
[3:32:42] fall there was no
[3:32:44] sickness and if been
[3:32:47] restored back again redeemed back again
[3:32:52] we must not be
[3:32:55] sick because the eternal life ised
[3:32:59] within
[3:33:01] us am we must not be sick I don't even
[3:33:05] think Mary was sick when she had Jesus
[3:33:12] in you can check your Bible I don't
[3:33:16] but I doubt because Jesus was eternal
[3:33:19] life he was the source of
[3:33:22] life and when sickness came because Mary
[3:33:26] had the
[3:33:27] body that power that life
[3:33:33] push hallu
[3:33:36] amen but pastor we get
[3:33:39] sick because we are not claiming the
[3:33:41] benefits of eternal life
[3:33:46] yes but if we claim it sickness comes
[3:33:51] you begin
[3:33:52] claiming the Bible says if you are
[3:33:54] sick go let the Elders of the church
[3:33:57] anoint you with oil and PR but what do
[3:34:00] we
[3:34:00] do
[3:34:04] sick and you claim you're a Believer
[3:34:08] with eternal
[3:34:09] life do what the Bible
[3:34:11] says the medicine is right in there
[3:34:15] does it mean I don't know that people
[3:34:17] get sick when they are
[3:34:20] believers that's not what I'm I'm here
[3:34:21] to talk about I'm here to represent what
[3:34:24] the word of God is
[3:34:27] saying I'm giving it to you if you're a
[3:34:30] Believer you will say
[3:34:32] amen amen it is a
[3:34:35] benefit you are supposed to live a life
[3:34:37] beyond and above these
[3:34:42] things that's why when a brother or one
[3:34:44] of us is sick
[3:34:47] we come let us
[3:34:49] pray you remember one of them in the
[3:34:51] Bible even died out of
[3:34:54] sickness I think it was a grandmother of
[3:34:57] what was was
[3:34:59] it very old sister in
[3:35:02] the and she was very
[3:35:04] helpful they said no no no no she was
[3:35:08] Brethren let us
[3:35:10] come she cannot she cannot die who will
[3:35:14] do that when someone dies
[3:35:21] but they knew who they
[3:35:24] were
[3:35:26] can Lord she cannot
[3:35:29] die they called her name back again to
[3:35:33] life that's the God we
[3:35:38] Ser I'm hearing a lot of
[3:35:43] unbelief forget about your reasoning
[3:35:47] [Music]
[3:35:49] is what we
[3:35:51] believe look a
[3:35:54] Believer must live a potent
[3:35:58] life a life that is
[3:36:01] able because you see it's not your life
[3:36:04] it's the Life of Christ in
[3:36:06] you when a situation comes don't own it
[3:36:11] AC
[3:36:16] [Music]
[3:36:19] you understand there are some
[3:36:21] situations we don't have to
[3:36:24] accept we have to change our
[3:36:27] mindset we have to think
[3:36:29] different why because we are
[3:36:34] Eternal did you know right now even if
[3:36:36] you brought a gun and killed me I cannot
[3:36:40] die did you know
[3:36:42] that did you know there are many people
[3:36:44] here on Earth who cannot die kill
[3:36:49] them those are the ones who have eternal
[3:36:54] life you can't kill them you can kill
[3:36:57] their
[3:36:58] body if God
[3:37:01] permits but if God
[3:37:03] permitted not you kill their
[3:37:09] body praise the name of the
[3:37:12] Lord now another benefit
[3:37:16] when we go over
[3:37:18] there we going to with
[3:37:22] him it's a benefit that we will have the
[3:37:26] others won't have
[3:37:28] it we shall have you know
[3:37:31] ranks even
[3:37:34] there the Bible speaks of all these
[3:37:37] things these are benefits but others who
[3:37:40] will get etal
[3:37:41] life on the
[3:37:43] Judgment they will not have anything
[3:37:46] there will be
[3:37:50] commoners look at look at the kingdoms
[3:37:52] of the
[3:37:53] world the way they
[3:37:55] function in many ways it is like the
[3:37:58] kingdom of
[3:38:01] God you have different
[3:38:05] classes in the royal
[3:38:08] family you have different
[3:38:11] classes the servants you have different
[3:38:14] classes
[3:38:17] and now the
[3:38:20] commoners so many people who would get
[3:38:24] life will be
[3:38:28] Comm that's the truth that's the truth
[3:38:32] that's the
[3:38:33] truth on Wednesday I'll try to go a
[3:38:35] little bit deeper
[3:38:37] into you you'll be surprised because see
[3:38:40] if we going if God is going to have a
[3:38:41] kingdom on
[3:38:43] Earth what is the kingdom without
[3:38:47] people you understand it will have to
[3:38:50] have
[3:38:51] people but people who will be ruled
[3:38:55] over and Christ cannot rule over his own
[3:39:02] royalty you understand he have to rule
[3:39:04] the Lesser
[3:39:07] class and so you see the
[3:39:09] Muslims they have something like this
[3:39:13] going they believe the more you do
[3:39:15] better you will
[3:39:18] get that is also
[3:39:21] scriptural and on Wednesday maybe I'll
[3:39:23] touch
[3:39:24] it not for the
[3:39:27] bride these things are not for the
[3:39:30] bride the bride is not going to heaven
[3:39:33] because of our
[3:39:38] works go the Rapture who
[3:39:41] told only believe that was the theme of
[3:39:45] the
[3:39:47] only believe all things
[3:39:49] only if you believe eternal life is
[3:39:53] yours if you believe you going to
[3:39:56] Rapture but we will see on Wednesday how
[3:39:59] there many other
[3:40:01] groups who will suddenly go and attain
[3:40:05] etal life but that's all they
[3:40:08] get and we will rule over them forever
[3:40:11] and ever and ever andever and ever
[3:40:16] even after this world has passed
[3:40:19] [Music]
[3:40:24] away the word of God is
[3:40:27] amazing it is very
[3:40:29] special to be the bride of
[3:40:34] Christ to be the body of
[3:40:37] Christ it is something like
[3:40:41] nothing do not trade it for anything
[3:40:46] do not sell your breth
[3:40:48] right because of some little
[3:40:50] portion some little
[3:40:53] porage what what what is two five
[3:40:56] million what is 10
[3:40:57] million is just some
[3:40:59] page it's nothing compar to the glory we
