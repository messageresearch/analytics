[36:42] small time
[36:45] he he communicated to me i've not been
[36:48] in touch with him but
[36:49] he communicated to me just a few days
[36:52] ago
[37:07] uganda i understand that uh there's a
[37:10] a family here that is related to them
[37:14] families uh
[37:18] he's a pastor musumba from
[37:27] he you know of course that area most of
[37:31] the people farmers
[37:32] actually have a singaporean and
[37:35] he usually works as a broker
[37:41] to go and you know the people come with
[37:44] money they give it to him then he goes
[37:46] buys the
[37:47] the mataki for them and then yeah
[37:55] so he just wrote in and told me
[37:58] now it happened that uh
[38:02] this time when somebody brought his
[38:04] money for him to go and do the
[38:06] purchasing
[38:07] of the matauke somebody walked into his
[38:10] house and stole the money again
[38:16] okay
[38:32] and uh no one has stepped up yet to help
[38:35] or collect anything for
[38:36] them
[38:42] we are the body of jesus christ the
[38:44] truth
[38:54] so i told him that i would bring you to
[38:56] you for prayer
[39:15] for any reason like preaching the gospel
[39:18] or baptizing people or
[39:19] or you know or standing for christ but

[52:34] is coming from verse 2 elect according
[52:36] to the full knowledge of god
[52:43] and so we noticed that uh we are in a
[52:46] generation
[52:48] where we have christians who do not care
[52:51] what they do
[52:52] now first they have preachers who have
[52:56] told them it does not matter what you do
[53:09] we have many believers who have been
[53:10] told well
[53:12] you have been
[53:55] i met this group of people merci canada
[53:58] and
[53:58] uh they were respectarians
[54:03] and i do not know their doctrine right
[54:05] now
[54:07] they loved the world and we were sharing
[54:08] the word
[54:33] [Music]
[54:36] i said what happened we're gonna teach
[54:38] you how to say oh why didn't you why did
[54:40] you
[54:40] not even tell me you know if you had a
[54:42] problem or if you had robbers come to
[54:43] you
[54:47] so you told me i'm selling my brother
[54:50] but the issue
[55:02] and i was really drunk and amid that so
[55:04] it
[55:29] [Music]
[55:32] you
[55:45] young people who like asking this

[58:03] [Applause]
[58:06] non-jews
[58:21] verse verse 2 that's where he talks

[58:44] the irish
[58:47] according to the foreign
[58:59] [Applause]
[59:16] of god

[1:38:29] you didn't even kill his wife
[1:38:33] at one point and i'll give you reasons
[1:38:36] for that
[1:38:37] one point judas yoda
[1:38:41] was among the disciples who went out to
[1:38:44] customers
[1:38:48] and they came back excited
[1:38:52] yes said why are you excited
[1:38:56] oh jesus
[1:39:23] because the demons are running away
[1:39:38] do we agree that judas's name was on the
[1:39:41] book of life
[1:39:46] do you agree with him
[1:39:50] was on the book of life
[1:40:34] and still betrayed jesus
[1:40:39] and somebody said oh he was a bad man
[1:40:45] betrayed jesus because he was an
[1:40:46] unbeliever yesterday
[1:41:00] actually believed in jesus more than the
[1:41:02] rest to you directly it is a numeration
[1:41:05] of sin
[1:41:06] because he had seen the power of jesus
[1:41:10] he had seen what jesus could do
[1:41:14] he had seen him go through people when
[1:41:16] they wanted to throw him
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:29] he really knew that's my money even if
[1:41:33] he goes and gets the money
[1:41:34] to nobody again that jesus can still
[1:41:38] just go through those people
[1:41:41] he knows how my god is great
[1:42:13] that jesus was more powerful to you you
[1:42:14] know just to god
[1:42:16] yes judas
[1:42:20] was different from peter you died
[1:42:23] because
[1:42:23] peter peter was thinking that jesus may
[1:42:26] be
[1:42:26] you know taken and so we have to fight
[1:42:29] that yes
[1:42:35] i'll take the money can you send me but
[1:42:38] also my jesus
[1:42:39] yeshua i want to know oh
[1:43:08] what
[1:43:19] [Applause]
[1:43:22] uh
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:51] while he was thinking those things
[1:43:52] nachos jesus took the ear yes
[1:43:56] from the ground over and he put it back
[1:43:58] on this man
[1:44:00] and the ear went back
[1:44:04] and peter
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:33] saw the chickens let me check back at
[1:44:34] the moment
[1:44:36] i thought i could distract my deal
[1:44:39] they are believers like those kids
[1:44:43] what's your choices that you make in
[1:44:45] your life
[1:45:00] when
[1:45:40] so those of you who don't want to repent
[1:45:42] because you are saying
[1:46:25] against that you should not watch the
[1:46:27] choices that you make

[1:46:36] do whatever you want to do
[1:47:04] oh glory follow me closely now
[1:47:17] please you have to give me this question
[1:47:18] people can follow me now amen

[1:47:31] he is the same god who picked an elected
[1:47:34] judas
[1:47:34] catholic
[1:47:57] that is why we should not take it for
[1:48:02] granted
[1:48:16] you should be happy because of that
[1:48:20] that god being infinite
[1:48:23] in the beginning near the end from the
[1:48:24] beginning

[1:48:34] so he would tell what would take place
[1:48:42] are you following me are you following
[1:48:58] knew the choices
[1:49:05] he knew that judas would make a choice
[1:49:07] to betray him yeah

[1:58:43] thereof when your eyes
[1:58:45] then your eyes shall be opened and he
[1:58:47] shall be as gods

[1:58:58] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[1:59:00] eat and gave also
[1:59:02] to her husband with her and he did it
[1:59:21] [Music]
[1:59:42] she calls the man to leave his place too
[1:59:46] much and i want to speak for just a
[1:59:48] minute to those of you who are married
[1:59:53] in marriage the devil has no access in

[2:00:32] place
[2:00:35] the lord has told you in his word submit
[2:00:38] yourself
[2:00:42] [Applause]
[2:00:48] [Music]
[2:00:53] those things which you feel are not
[2:00:55] appropriate for you to submit to

[2:02:45] looking amen for women who will submit
[2:02:48] to their
[2:02:48] husbands in all things
[2:02:56] but a woman shouldn't leave that
[2:02:58] position
[2:03:12] the church
[2:04:18] that's why a genuine brother who loves
[2:04:20] his wife can never lay his hand upon
[2:04:49] both of them have left their place for
[2:04:51] them before we are in the same way
[2:04:54] when eve left her place
[2:04:58] her place was to obey what her husband
[2:05:01] told her
[2:05:03] [Music]
[2:05:04] but another man
[2:05:15] of god we should stay in our places too
[2:05:32] if
[2:06:00] she fell to the trap now
[2:06:03] category and she left her place another
[2:06:07] forge and she fell to the track
[2:06:10] now what momentum came in
[2:06:13] eve is not supple since we're standing
[2:06:17] but she's seen
[2:06:18] now yeah you know because of our choices
[2:06:21] the devil tried his best standing up for
[2:06:24] nature the only thing he would have done
[2:06:27] i'm sorry i want
[2:06:39] [Music]
[2:06:56] today
[2:07:00] what time is it all right it's 12
[2:07:04] 26 but by now usually i should finish
[2:07:06] but if i finish now
[2:07:07] i'm leaving this topic halfway how many

[2:07:36] you remember when he called him out
[2:07:38] there and he said he would not keep the
[2:07:39] thing as separate from him
[2:07:45] when he was going to destroy sodom and
[2:07:47] gomorrah
[2:07:49] he said foreign himself
[2:07:55] i know that abraham would send this
[2:07:57] message on down from one generation to
[2:07:59] the other
[2:08:06] but god
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:09:02] hallelujah when god elects you
[2:09:07] is electing you so that his purpose
[2:09:10] in you can be accomplished
