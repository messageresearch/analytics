[37:23] house of the
[37:25] Lord your amens are important to me
[37:28] because the way that you respond to the
[37:30] preaching of the
[37:32] word is what says the tone of the
[37:36] service you me
[37:38] down I'll will just remain
[37:41] down but if we are about to
[37:44] fly make sure that your seat belts are
[37:47] fastened because the destinations is in
[37:49] Heavenly
[37:50] places not the First

[38:10] pastor for the opportunity that he has
[38:12] given me and also the Saints of evening
[38:16] light it's such a blessing to be
[38:18] standing before you I always and usually
[38:21] say that it's not hard to preach to a
[38:22] message
[38:23] believer because the message believer
[38:25] knows exactly what you're talking about
[38:28] so if you make a simple mistake don't
[38:31] worry they will be in your inbox in the
[38:32] evening they're telling you brother you
[38:34] misquoted the scripture there brother
[38:37] you misquoted the prophet when he was
[38:38] say hallelujah but we believe that the
[38:41] Lord will give us
[38:42] Grace and the Lord will anoint our
[38:45] lips without further wasting your time
[38:47] let us open in the book of Exodus
[38:52] 12:7 Exodus the book of Exodus 12:7
[38:58] chter 12:
[38:59] 11 how many know that we are in an
[39:03] exodus we are right in the Third
[39:06] Exodus coming out of
[39:09] denominationalism getting into the word
[39:11] of the
[39:12] hour coming out of the ludan church age
[39:16] getting into the bright age praise God
[39:19] hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[39:21] hallelujah now the Bible says in the
[39:23] book of Exodus
[39:25] 12:7
[39:28] and they shall take the of the blood and
[39:31] strike it on the same uh they shall take
[39:33] of the blood and strike it on the two
[39:35] sides of the post and on the upper door
[39:38] post of the houses wherein they shall
[39:40] eat
[39:50] it after that we go to the Book of
[39:54] Leviticus The Book of Leviticus chapter
[39:58] 7 verse
[40:01] 24 verse 27 26 to
[40:04] 27 lus chapter
[40:07] 7 Leviticus The Book of Leviticus
[40:10] chapter
[40:11] 7 vers 26 to
[40:16] 27 it says here moreover ye shall eat no
[40:20] manner of blood whether it be of foul or
[40:23] of beasts in any of the in any of your
[40:26] dwellings whatsoever Soul it be that
[40:29] eateth any manner of blood even that
[40:32] Soul shall be cut off from his
[40:50] people hallelujah then we go to the book
[40:52] of Hebrews chapter
[40:55] 9
[40:57] Hebrews chapter
[41:00] 9:22 it says here and almost all things
[41:03] are by the law preed with blood and
[41:06] without the shedding of blood is no
[41:08] remission of
[41:20] sins again in the book of Hebrews 12
[41:23] verse
[41:25] 24
[41:27] it says here and to Jesus the mediator
[41:28] of the New Covenant and to the blood of
[41:31] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[41:33] than that of
[41:42] Abel Hallelujah let us close our eyes
[41:44] and just commit the word of the
[41:46] Lord precious gracious Heavenly Father
[41:49] come th presence thank you for the
[41:52] anointing and the
[41:54] opportunity I am just but an unpr
[41:56] profitable
[41:57] servant I know not the right words to
[41:59] say or to speak to your people but you
[42:01] have the food already stored in your
[42:04] storehouses may you just help your
[42:06] humble servant in hiding behind the
[42:08] cross may never be seen but that you
[42:10] speak to your
[42:11] children may this word Heavenly Father
[42:13] bring about the breaking of all the
[42:16] chains and ask to return back to the
[42:20] fellowship in the mighty name of our
[42:22] Lord Jesus Christ we
[42:24] pray hallelujah praise God
[42:27] you may be
[42:28] seated now we have read here a portion
[42:31] of
[42:32] scripture in the book of Exodus
[42:36] 12:7 when God spake unto the prophet
[42:39] Moses and told the prophet that you
[42:43] shall kill an a
[42:44] lamp without spot or blemish a lamp
[42:48] without
[42:49] wrinkle now our Prophet when he comes to
[42:51] the sin he explains to us that the Old
[42:54] Testament is just by The Shadow
[42:57] a shadow of the things that were to be
[43:00] it was all pointing to the Lord Jesus
[43:03] Christ why when you read the Bible you
[43:06] do not see the Lord Jesus Christ go back
[43:09] and read it again now we all know that
[43:12] Christ was the Lamb of God the one was
[43:14] without SP or wrink the one without
[43:17] blemish he was the one that was being
[43:20] represented by this lamb that was being
[43:22] spoken here as you better reading the
[43:25] scripture in verse in verse 7 here you
[43:28] hear the Lord was telling Moses that
[43:30] when you shall kill that lamb before you
[43:33] eat it Thou shalt take off the
[43:35] blood and you you you sprinkle it on the
[43:40] post of the door on the lanter you see
[43:44] now this is just but a representation of
[43:46] the Cross because you have something
[43:48] like this and another another sprink of
[43:50] blood which is vertical and another one
[43:53] is diagonal that just brings about the
[43:55] cross
[43:57] it was all pointing back to the Lord
[43:58] Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God now
[44:02] there is something that is important
[44:03] about the blood in the Bible the blood
[44:06] is spoken of 392
[44:09] times and we only have 66 books in the
[44:12] Bible which is enough for the blood to
[44:14] be spoken twice in every book it shows
[44:18] you the importance of the blood now when
[44:21] you read further in the book of
[44:22] levius the Lord is giving an a direct to
[44:26] the
[44:27] people that you are not supposed to
[44:29] consume of any
[44:30] blood any animal now my question is why
[44:35] are we not supposed to consume the blood
[44:38] the prophet tells us that in the blood
[44:41] that is where the Gin of life is for the
[44:44] blood of every animal is the life of
[44:47] every animal the the blood that is in
[44:50] you is the life that is in you praise
[44:53] God hallelujah now even science sence
[44:56] science tells you that in your blood is
[45:00] where the DNA is
[45:02] found what is the
[45:04] DNA the
[45:06] DNA is the
[45:08] blueprint or it is the
[45:11] recipe of the composition of your
[45:14] body in that
[45:16] DNA is a peculiar
[45:18] fingerprint that is different from each
[45:20] and every
[45:21] person God does not duplicate a DNA your
[45:26] blood is different somehow from the
[45:28] person next to you because is the
[45:31] blueprint of who you
[45:33] are also
[45:35] discovered that what causes these
[45:39] diseases to be
[45:41] hereditary because there is something
[45:43] that is in the blood hallah the Bible
[45:46] tells us that Levi paid
[45:50] tithe in the Lo of
[45:54] Abraham did that get transferred to him
[45:57] it was an issue of the blood that's why
[46:00] generational Spirits from where you come
[46:02] from are able to you not because you in
[46:06] Uganda because even if you travel to the
[46:08] United States of America those Spirits
[46:11] would still find why because they follow
[46:14] a certain pattern they follow a certain
[46:17] fingerprint that is found in the blood
[46:20] Hallelujah so the matter of the blood is
[46:23] very important the Bible in the prophet
[46:25] tells us that the devil hates the Book
[46:28] of Genesis why does he hate the Book of
[46:31] Genesis it is the where are the Gen
[46:34] found are found in the blood that is
[46:38] where all things started and originated
[46:39] from in the Book of Genesis that is why
[46:43] whenever I get an opportunity to preach
[46:45] I try to bring my message all the way
[46:47] back to Genesis because that's the
[46:50] beginning of all things Hallelujah now
[46:52] in Genesis you realize and you find out
[46:57] that when when Eve was beged by
[47:00] the fell to
[47:03] sin not being deceived CH to partake of
[47:07] the same sin hallelujah praise godu when
[47:10] he fell into sin God did not come down
[47:15] God was not bothered because he
[47:17] fall but God was bothered when fell into
[47:21] s why because the G the Propet explains
[47:25] to us hallelujah in the message God
[47:28] perfecting his church that the sh of
[47:31] life is found in the male SE is found in
[47:36] the saw the losing of Abraham Adam when
[47:40] he lost his
[47:41] position brought all the
[47:44] blood of
[47:46] humanity and it was
[47:48] stained why the very moment that Adam of
[47:52] the had to come down right there to make
[47:56] a way because he knew that if he would
[47:58] not make a way all atace was going to be
[48:01] lost because the DNA was in the the same
[48:05] way if I P TI in the of Abraham the same
[48:10] way you and I to sin when we were in the
[48:14] Lo of Hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[48:17] are you following me tonight Hallelujah
[48:20] do not miss this because it is important
[48:24] now that is why
[48:26] when we go down further in the Book of
[48:29] Genesis a prophet AB under the
[48:33] anointing knew that this was not a
[48:35] matter of anything else but because it
[48:38] took the blood to
[48:40] throw into being lost it was going to
[48:44] take the blood to bring men back that is
[48:48] why by that same
[48:49] Revelation AB had to offer a lamp of
[48:52] sacrifice pointing again back to the
[48:55] cross of calvary
[48:56] it was a revelation it was not in Beauty
[49:00] so as thought Hallelujah this message of
[49:04] the hour is dripping with blood it is a
[49:08] matter of the blood it's the blood that
[49:10] th that
[49:12] th being lost it is the blood that will
[49:15] bring them back hallelujah praise God
[49:18] hallelujah how many believe and are
[49:20] grateful for the blood the blood that
[49:22] was shed upon the cross of Calvary my I
[49:25] want to tell you that is why we apply
[49:28] the blood what is the blood the blood is
[49:33] the token the prophet goes on to explain
[49:36] as we shall find out in the potations
[49:39] that in that
[49:40] blood God chose to Veil himself in what
[49:44] is called a blood
[49:46] cell because when the prophecy came that
[49:49] a virgin shall conceive the prophet at
[49:52] one time thought that it was an
[49:54] egg God created in
[49:57] evil then he came back and said no it
[50:00] was not an egg but because it were an
[50:03] egg it would have something to do with a
[50:06] woman but God did not want anything to
[50:08] do with a woman that is why he took a
[50:11] blood
[50:12] cell and failed himself the life of God
[50:16] in that blood cell and put blood cell in
[50:20] the
[50:21] woman Mary and that blood cell because
[50:26] it had a life in it it was going to
[50:29] bring forth life because the law of
[50:32] life that life bring forth its own kind
[50:36] now the life that was right there was
[50:39] not the life of Mary was not the life of
[50:42] a Jew nor was it the life of a gentile
[50:45] but it was the life of God himself it
[50:48] was the set o
[50:50] e o n o e z o e the Zoe
[50:58] life of God hallelujah praise God now
[51:02] the blood of Jesus Christ was not of a
[51:04] Jew of a gentile hallelujah praise God
[51:09] so what brought us back into Fellowship
[51:11] was not the blood of a man that is why
[51:14] we read in the book of Hebrews that
[51:16] there is a blood that speaketh better
[51:19] things than the blood of Abel hallelujah
[51:23] hallelujah I did not know that the blood
[51:27] voice the blood speaks because when God
[51:32] whenw God came to Kan and said I hear
[51:36] the blood of your young brother it is
[51:39] calling out to me so there is something
[51:42] that is important there is something
[51:44] that is mysterious that is hidden in the
[51:47] blood hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[51:50] hallelujah that is why my precious
[51:52] brother you cannot have life
[51:56] without the blood there are three things
[51:58] that are there present before life is
[52:02] there is there is the water which is why
[52:05] we are baptized by water there is the
[52:08] blood and after the blood there comes
[52:11] out alive so it is the blood of Jesus
[52:14] Christ that brings about New Birth
[52:18] hallelujah praise God hallelujah that's
[52:21] why you see when Abraham after he took
[52:25] Isaac up the mountain and was about to
[52:28] kill him and God said no stop because it
[52:32] was never a matter of anybody else's
[52:35] blood the blood of the Lamb when God St
[52:39] Abraham anded him to a that c in the
[52:45] ticket hallelujah hallelujah and he took
[52:48] that lamb and he offered it for a
[52:51] sacrifice right after doing that came
[52:54] down to Abra
[52:56] and said Abraham I've seen that you love
[52:57] me and you have not withheld thy son
[53:00] from me and because of this Blood I am
[53:03] now giving you an unconditional Covenant
[53:08] hallelujah praise God that is why
[53:10] without dis spilling of blood there is
[53:13] no remission of sin the blood is what
[53:17] activates the
[53:18] Covenant hallelujah praise God now
[53:21] because you have the blood of Christ in
[53:22] you the Covenant of God and man is
[53:25] forever present and is forever alive and
[53:29] it is hidden in you hallelujah praise
[53:32] God what happened when men what happens
[53:36] when men is born again there is a blood
[53:41] transfusion your blood is done away with
[53:44] and the blood of Christ is what gets in
[53:47] you in other words there is no Spirit
[53:52] from your generation of fathers that can
[53:54] trace after you because what is in you
[53:58] is not your blood but it is the blood of
[54:01] the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that is
[54:04] why cancer there no power because it is
[54:07] not your blood but it is the blood of
[54:10] the Lord Jesus Christ and the blood of
[54:12] the Lamb shall never lose its power the
[54:15] blood of Jesus shall never shall never
[54:20] his power oh praise God I'm reminded of
[54:23] a story Hallelujah after the children of
[54:26] Israel and Paul and other prisoners were
[54:31] shrecked and they were
[54:33] gathering to put in the
[54:35] fire and a very vicious snake that was
[54:39] known on that continent if it were in
[54:42] Africa it would have been a black m
[54:45] because they say the black m is the most
[54:48] dangerous snake but all praise
[54:52] God because we have been given the power
[54:55] to B and to un
[54:57] that Hallelujah glory to God so when was
[55:02] by the they thought that he was going to
[55:04] die 5 Seconds they waited they thought
[55:07] he was going to have problem breathing
[55:10] they waited they thought that he was
[55:12] going to swell and die but Paul did not
[55:16] die and they looked at him and they say
[55:19] this one must be a god they were wrong
[55:23] but they were not so far from the truth
[55:26] because Paul in Paul was the life the
[55:30] life of Christ Christ the literal life
[55:34] that was in him so in other words the
[55:37] blood that was in po was richer than the
[55:39] poison s that is why when greater power
[55:43] comes lesser power must power oh
[55:47] Hallelujah and there is power in the
[55:49] blood precious wonderful power
[55:52] Hallelujah in the blood of the Lamb
[55:55] praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
[55:58] glory to God hallelujah hallelujah there
[56:03] something special about the
[56:04] blood Hallelujah but in the book of in
[56:07] the Old
[56:08] Testament remember the Old Testament was
[56:10] a
[56:12] shadow things that to come now was the
[56:15] blood of bulls
[56:17] ands the blood of bus and gos excuse me
[56:21] I'm just laying a foundation so that
[56:23] when we get to the reading of the qu you
[56:26] might know exactly where we are coming
[56:28] from Hallelujah remember we are coming
[56:31] from the Earthly going to the heaven Le
[56:34] and what is it that guarantees us a
[56:37] place in the heavens is the spilling of
[56:40] the blood remember without the shedding
[56:43] of blood there is no remission of sin
[56:46] hallelujah praise God now blood of bulls
[56:49] and goats bu and goats could not save
[56:52] you from
[56:53] sin blood and God could not save you
[56:56] from
[56:57] harits that is why they would come every
[57:00] year and offer a lamb of
[57:02] sacrifice for the same things that they
[57:04] did last year why because in the blood
[57:07] of BR and there was no power to change a
[57:11] life remember the life of an
[57:14] animal cannot replace the life of a
[57:17] human being so to take the life of a
[57:20] human being to replace the life that was
[57:22] in a man you can take the blood of an
[57:26] animal and put it in a dying man because
[57:29] the DNA does not mat hallelujah
[57:33] hallelujah but he took the blood of God
[57:35] he came down and became a k redemer and
[57:38] was like you and me so that his blood
[57:42] could transferable so that his blood
[57:45] could get in your body and Quicken your
[57:47] weak body
[57:49] hallelujah praise God hallelujah if
[57:52] you're following say Amen you know the
[57:55] power of the blood say amen hallelujah
[57:58] praise God the blood of bulls and goats
[58:01] could not change your life but it could
[58:03] only cover praise God for the Lamb of
[58:07] God that was slain before the foundation
[58:10] of the world Hallelujah he is dripping
[58:14] with blood oh yes is dripping with blood
[58:17] there still place on the atonement seat
[58:21] because the blood is still wet
[58:25] the blood is still
[58:27] flesh hallelujah hallelujah but let me
[58:30] tell you something it's not the
[58:33] chemistry of the
[58:35] blood no say because blood is
[58:39] corruptible Hallelujah if you start
[58:41] bleeding
[58:43] now and your shed gets
[58:45] stained in a few hours that shed will be
[58:49] smelling why because blood is
[58:53] corruptible that's why the prophet
[58:55] explains and says that it was not the
[58:59] blood not just the literal blood or the
[59:01] chemistry of the
[59:03] blood but it was the life the life that
[59:06] was in the blood and that life is what
[59:10] is
[59:11] hidden is what is
[59:13] veiled is veiled by the blood hallelujah
[59:17] praise God hallelujah hallelujah oh
[59:20] glory to God isn't he wonderful isn't
[59:25] wonderful Oh Glory to God now we are
[59:28] going to read from the quotations to
[59:30] hear what the prophet say in the message
[59:34] the unfailing realities of the Living
[59:37] God
[59:41] 60626
[59:44] 6626 from paragraph
[59:48] 26 hallelujah hallelujah it was a matter
[59:51] of the
[59:53] blood was the blood that is why we sing
[59:57] that song I know it was the
[1:00:00] blood I know it was the
[1:00:02] blood hallelujah praise
[1:00:05] God it says
[1:00:07] here paragraph
[1:00:10] 96 it says now every born again
[1:00:14] Christian has a ro set before
[1:00:17] you you got to follow that
[1:00:20] road God marks it
[1:00:22] out what marks the road
[1:00:25] that's the question now the prophet is
[1:00:28] explaining now and is saying the
[1:00:32] blood it is marked by the
[1:00:35] blood and the
[1:00:37] spirit
[1:00:39] always lives in the blood
[1:00:43] Hallelujah but through the blood
[1:00:46] comes life blood
[1:00:50] cell is the Life Cell Hallelujah praise
[1:00:55] God hallelujah that is why we apply the
[1:01:00] blood and he say the Lord says when I
[1:01:03] see the blood I will pass over you what
[1:01:06] is it that he's looking at God is
[1:01:09] looking at his own spirit because the
[1:01:11] spirit's Dwelling Place the prophet says
[1:01:14] it always dwells it always dwells in the
[1:01:18] blood what is life the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:21] life that is why the Bible says
[1:01:25] he that believed on me and received of
[1:01:28] this Blood shall from Death un life
[1:01:32] hallelujah praise God once You' have had
[1:01:34] a blood transfusion you now have life
[1:01:38] the spirit of God that is why you cannot
[1:01:41] have a born again
[1:01:44] experience outside of the blood because
[1:01:48] the
[1:01:49] blood that's
[1:01:51] where that's
[1:01:53] where in in the blood that's where the
[1:01:55] life
[1:01:56] is in other words when the Bible says by
[1:01:59] one Spirit we Bap into one body
[1:02:02] Hallelujah is actually saying by one
[1:02:05] blood the blood of God himself because
[1:02:08] that's where the spirit is found it is
[1:02:11] found in the blood that is why Jesus
[1:02:13] Christ at the cross had to shed that
[1:02:16] blood oh hallelujah hallelujah praise
[1:02:20] God glory to
[1:02:22] God oh Hallelujah go
[1:02:24] again and
[1:02:27] read in the message the
[1:02:30] witnesses
[1:02:31] preach
[1:02:35] 1954 Witnesses preached
[1:02:38] 1954 the thir of
[1:02:40] March the third of
[1:02:42] March it says here he wasn't no man's
[1:02:46] blood yes he wasn't no man's blood it
[1:02:50] means Christ Christ he wasn't no man's
[1:02:52] blood Christ was not any man's blood
[1:02:57] blood he was the creative blood of
[1:03:01] Jehovah who created the blood
[1:03:05] cell he was neither Jew nor
[1:03:08] Gentile by Blood he was
[1:03:11] God God's
[1:03:14] blood God's
[1:03:16] blood saved us we were not saved by the
[1:03:20] blood of Israelite
[1:03:23] nor blood of an
[1:03:25] Israelite once is
[1:03:27] spilled it is corruptible once the blood
[1:03:30] of an Israelite it has got
[1:03:33] bitterness the blood of an Israelite has
[1:03:36] got double
[1:03:38] mindedness the blood of an Israelite
[1:03:41] Hallelujah has got hate that is why you
[1:03:44] have got Wars right now in
[1:03:47] Palestine because of the blood that they
[1:03:51] carry in the blood did you you know that
[1:03:56] temper is found in your blood that is
[1:03:59] why when you get temper you have high
[1:04:01] blood
[1:04:02] pressure why do you think that when you
[1:04:04] are
[1:04:05] troubled your blood pressure Rises it's
[1:04:08] because all those things they have found
[1:04:11] their an
[1:04:12] imprint in the blood that is why it was
[1:04:16] not the blood of an Israelite that was
[1:04:19] able to save us but it was the blood of
[1:04:23] God himself
[1:04:24] hallelujah hallelujah it was the
[1:04:26] creative
[1:04:27] power of God himself now when that blood
[1:04:32] comes in the life of a Believer oh
[1:04:34] praise God he can stand and say father I
[1:04:38] give you
[1:04:40] rain I give you rain and rain comes
[1:04:44] because he is the creative power this is
[1:04:48] why when you have cancer I stand and say
[1:04:51] you evil spirit iure you
[1:04:54] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:56] live and go and demons will live and
[1:05:00] demons will obey because in me it's not
[1:05:04] about the word it's not about the state
[1:05:06] of the body it is about the blood
[1:05:10] composition of the blood that is flowing
[1:05:12] in me hallelujah praise
[1:05:15] God hallelujah hallelujah in questions
[1:05:18] and answers we are going to be reading a
[1:05:20] lot Hallelujah because I don't have any
[1:05:22] words that I can say
[1:05:24] don't have a new
[1:05:25] revelation Mal 4 has given us all the
[1:05:29] Revelation because shall begin to sound
[1:05:32] the mystery of God should be and the
[1:05:35] Mysteries are finished and we as the
[1:05:37] fivefold ministry our job is just to
[1:05:39] Echo back just to read from the books of
[1:05:42] the prophets like Daniel was reading
[1:05:45] from the books of the Prophet Jeremiah
[1:05:47] like Mah could not come and prophesy
[1:05:49] anything outside of what Elijah
[1:05:52] prophesied Hallelujah
[1:05:55] praise God now when we go and reading
[1:05:57] the questions of questions and
[1:06:00] answers of the series the LA having a
[1:06:03] shadow that was preached
[1:06:06] 1954 so that I can read fast in safe
[1:06:10] time wonderful it says from paragraph
[1:06:15] 156 there he goes I hear his old cross
[1:06:18] dragging down the streets making a
[1:06:20] roaring bumpy noise as it goes down his
[1:06:23] poor little bodies moving and they are
[1:06:25] walking along weeping him with a whep go
[1:06:28] on you Holy Roller you got we got our
[1:06:30] organizations we got our churches we
[1:06:32] don't need you to come around and ball
[1:06:35] us out of out and about our church you
[1:06:37] making yourself the god of the Sabbath
[1:06:39] why don't you do something about it now
[1:06:41] oh you Holy Roller and the Very Creator
[1:06:44] listen to this and the Very Creator
[1:06:46] moving along in the flesh there is that
[1:06:49] blood cell moving up and just bathing
[1:06:53] down his back as he moves a little
[1:06:55] further paragraph 157 now let's look I
[1:06:58] notice over his back there he's got a
[1:07:00] rope throw across his shoulder and his
[1:07:02] wolf through out without a SIM and now
[1:07:05] all over the little Rob now a little
[1:07:08] white uh Little Rob now a little white
[1:07:10] Rob there becomes a little red spot look
[1:07:13] at how it started it was a little red
[1:07:17] spot it's the blood coming through back
[1:07:20] where he was by his stripes were are
[1:07:21] healed oh could I deny that God keeping
[1:07:24] me mentally right I don't care if it
[1:07:26] costs me my blood what would my old
[1:07:29] dirty adulterated blood be at at the
[1:07:32] side of his hallelujah praise God what
[1:07:34] would be my blood my dirty blood what
[1:07:38] would be at the side of his that's why I
[1:07:41] don't care of my own blood in other
[1:07:43] words that's why I don't care of my own
[1:07:44] life because in my blood that's where my
[1:07:47] life is but the Bible says he that
[1:07:49] preserves his life the same shall lose
[1:07:52] it but he that loses his
[1:07:54] the same shall gain it that is why the
[1:07:57] prophet here is saying I would I want to
[1:07:59] keep my blood I don't care if they
[1:08:02] persecute me that's the problem we have
[1:08:04] with Christians today they are afraid of
[1:08:06] persecution they are afraid of losing
[1:08:08] their lives but your blood does not
[1:08:11] matter what matter is the blood of the
[1:08:14] lambed a small
[1:08:16] spot
[1:08:18] Hallelujah there I see moving moving as
[1:08:21] them watch as he goes on up them spots
[1:08:23] getting bigger and bigger and bigger as
[1:08:26] he moves on I see him fall I see a
[1:08:29] colored man come along and help him this
[1:08:31] is our forefather the prophet says this
[1:08:33] black man is our forefather here how
[1:08:35] many believe that how many believe that
[1:08:38] how many believe that praise God I see a
[1:08:42] black man colored man come along helping
[1:08:45] him bear with the cross put it upon his
[1:08:47] shoulder he moves on he can hardly move
[1:08:49] now look at him as he goes as he moving
[1:08:51] on all them little spots run into one
[1:08:54] big spot hallelujah amen it was the spot
[1:08:58] of
[1:08:59] Blood on the cross of
[1:09:01] Calvary but the prophet tells us that on
[1:09:04] the cross of Calvary that blood cell
[1:09:08] remember it failed
[1:09:10] life but for the life that was in the
[1:09:14] blood cell to be released the blood cell
[1:09:17] had to be broken in other words the
[1:09:20] blood cell had to be split when the
[1:09:22] blood cell was broken
[1:09:24] remember it started as one spot but
[1:09:27] those spots were becoming more and more
[1:09:29] and becoming bigger and bigger
[1:09:31] transferred from one life of a Believer
[1:09:34] into the other believer One believer
[1:09:36] into the other one believer into the
[1:09:38] other one beli into the other that's why
[1:09:41] there's not stopping the gospel because
[1:09:44] this blood cannot be stopped if it was a
[1:09:46] small spot if it was a small spot and it
[1:09:50] grew bigger that's the same with this
[1:09:52] message it's began in a long cabin but
[1:09:56] now it is around the face of the Earth
[1:09:58] and there are people almost everywhere
[1:10:01] whose hearts are all of flame with the
[1:10:03] fire fill on P hallelujah praise God
[1:10:08] hallelujah hallelujah that's that blood
[1:10:11] spot hallelujah hallelujah and after
[1:10:14] while I hear something now going brother
[1:10:16] bham slowly claps his hand what is it
[1:10:18] it's that old bloody garment beating
[1:10:20] against his legs what is animal blood
[1:10:23] finish
[1:10:24] there is the second Adam remember it
[1:10:27] took the first
[1:10:28] Adam and his blood to throw human race
[1:10:31] into chaos it also had to take another
[1:10:34] Adam and his blood to redeem him back
[1:10:39] and bring back into Fellowship that is
[1:10:41] why the blood cell is the secret of the
[1:10:45] access back to fellowship fellowship
[1:10:48] with the Creator Hallelujah because when
[1:10:50] you have his blood you become kle folks
[1:10:54] when you have his blood you do not just
[1:10:57] become a servant but you become an
[1:11:00] a of what God has but you become in a of
[1:11:04] who God
[1:11:05] is hallelujah you did not get that when
[1:11:10] you become an a of the things that the
[1:11:12] pastor has it means you can have his car
[1:11:16] it means you can have his house but
[1:11:19] there are certain things that you cannot
[1:11:20] have you cannot have the pastor's wife
[1:11:24] even if you in air there are certain
[1:11:26] things that you cannot have meaning that
[1:11:28] if you're in air to the things that he
[1:11:30] has you are limited but because of the
[1:11:33] blood we have become a of who exactly
[1:11:38] God is that is in the message the
[1:11:41] anointed the end the prophet says we are
[1:11:45] Messi we are Messi are
[1:11:49] say the young one of
[1:11:52] cow is a cow the young one of a snake is
[1:11:56] a snake what about the young one of God
[1:12:00] he is a God hallelujah hallelujah it's
[1:12:03] all because of the blood cell it's all
[1:12:07] because of the blood
[1:12:09] transfusion prise God there is the god
[1:12:13] of Heaven that's not animal blood that's
[1:12:16] God's blood Bea
[1:12:18] against second after I'm going to die
[1:12:21] for the human race God made Adam himself
[1:12:25] and living here on the earth I'm going
[1:12:27] to jump some things here paragraph 59
[1:12:30] and the blood of BU and gods could not
[1:12:32] take away sin but in due season Jesus
[1:12:34] Christ comes and makes the the
[1:12:37] worshipper perfected by the baptism of
[1:12:39] the Holy Ghost who Jesus Christ died in
[1:12:42] his place at Calvary you see now the
[1:12:44] prophet is is continuously comparing and
[1:12:48] explaining and that's the Holy Ghost is
[1:12:50] the blood the Holy Ghost is the life in
[1:12:53] the blood
[1:12:56] Hallelujah in another
[1:12:58] message the Lord having a Shad this one
[1:13:00] was questions and
[1:13:02] ANW the having a
[1:13:06] shadow let me look for it
[1:13:09] here hallelujah and after we are done
[1:13:11] reading these things then we'll really
[1:13:14] get into the message and we just finish
[1:13:15] off I have a very small
[1:13:19] message all right um let me skip that
[1:13:22] let me go
[1:13:24] to uh says uh hold on Hallelujah it
[1:13:29] seems as though
[1:13:34] this just some little white Dre of hair
[1:13:38] he was walking through the the place
[1:13:40] looking around and there at once he
[1:13:43] stopped looked over again and started
[1:13:48] weep okay can you hold on let me just
[1:13:50] read through he wept for a few moments
[1:13:53] then I I see him bow his head and begin
[1:13:54] offering prayer wased him for a little
[1:13:56] while on the blood of 127
[1:14:02] Hallelujah if the blood of
[1:14:06] Abra slaves

[1:14:17] spirit Power hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:21] praise God hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:14:25] to
[1:14:26] God this is my last
[1:14:29] quotation CL this one I'm not going to
[1:14:32] read it I'm just going to paraphrase for
[1:14:34] you and I'll just read just a few
[1:14:37] portions now the prophet one day he went
[1:14:41] into a
[1:14:42] restaurant in that restaurant he saw an
[1:14:45] old woman this old woman was had a
[1:14:47] painted face she was all that you can
[1:14:51] call
[1:14:52] Jezebel have perfume it SM like
[1:14:55] Jezebel if you have noticed if you have
[1:14:59] noticed these women of the night they
[1:15:02] use the same
[1:15:03] perfume do you know why do you know why
[1:15:07] they use the same perfume right when you
[1:15:09] smoke a cigarette you are taking in it's
[1:15:14] air but that air when they want to taste
[1:15:17] to test to see if you have taken
[1:15:20] drugs what do they do they take Temple
[1:15:23] of your
[1:15:24] blood that is why these women they use
[1:15:28] the same perfume they the
[1:15:31] Revelation that smell it goes in and
[1:15:34] confuses the
[1:15:35] blood because that's what happens your
[1:15:38] blood gets
[1:15:39] confused then you see them very
[1:15:42] beautiful but if you see her in the
[1:15:44] morning you yourself why was she
[1:15:47] was because at that very moment the
[1:15:50] smell it confused your blood because it
[1:15:53] Go and confuses the blood that is why
[1:15:56] even Solomon says This Woman This harot
[1:16:01] she buys an expensive perfume and goes
[1:16:04] and puts on a linen because the moment
[1:16:07] that you enter there you are confused
[1:16:10] this is not where my message is but I
[1:16:12] just thought I should tell you so this
[1:16:14] woman had a perfume of some
[1:16:16] certain that was confusing the blood of
[1:16:19] many people were there there was a c
[1:16:21] down there red around the young woman
[1:16:25] and they were kissing anding each other
[1:16:28] and making love in the restaurant what a
[1:16:32] sight what a
[1:16:34] sight now the prophet says
[1:16:37] here and then when the prophet saw him
[1:16:40] saw he started condemning him God can
[1:16:43] you just wipe the face of the we tired
[1:16:46] of such things spoil our children that's
[1:16:50] the attitude of many Believers
[1:16:52] tonight is not converted and if you have
[1:16:55] not met Christ that's why you are so
[1:16:57] quick to judge another Pastor that's why
[1:16:59] you are so quick to persecute El because
[1:17:02] you have not yet the experience that the
[1:17:05] prophet after was doing all that he says
[1:17:09] now and the Lord called me behind the
[1:17:11] door and I saw a vision I saw the world
[1:17:15] and it's
[1:17:16] turning and I saw that my sins hold on
[1:17:19] and I saw that my sins and other sins
[1:17:21] was going I thought God why don't you
[1:17:24] just blow the place up I I how can you
[1:17:26] stand it but it but then I seen around
[1:17:30] the world was a crimson stream I seen
[1:17:32] the Lord Jesus Christ standing there in
[1:17:34] all all of his beity as he was looking
[1:17:36] down upon the Earth and I seen my sins
[1:17:38] as they went up to him but his blood act
[1:17:40] like a bumper before God they could not
[1:17:43] come to him I sin every time I do
[1:17:45] anything wrong his blood would stand
[1:17:47] between me and the judgments of God and
[1:17:50] I walked up to him and I said Lord in
[1:17:52] the vision is my sins doing that I said
[1:17:55] then forgive me God I didn't mean to do
[1:17:57] it he stuck his hand in my side and
[1:18:00] reached and reached over and got a
[1:18:02] little
[1:18:03] book uh in the side and reached over and
[1:18:05] got a little book and that name was and
[1:18:08] my name was written on all full of the
[1:18:11] sin and wrot and he wrot pardoned across
[1:18:13] it and throw it back behind him in the
[1:18:15] sea of forgetfulness he said I now
[1:18:18] forgive you for your sins but what are
[1:18:20] you saying about that woman when that
[1:18:22] Vision came out I went down and sat with
[1:18:24] her and I said lady was you ever a
[1:18:26] Christian she said why are you asking me
[1:18:28] for that and I begin to speak to her and
[1:18:30] she told me had broken story of how some
[1:18:32] things come up in the church you see the
[1:18:34] prophet was quick to judge he did not
[1:18:35] know what to put that woman in that
[1:18:37] condition but talking to him he realized
[1:18:40] what
[1:18:42] happened I hope I'm still on time I'm
[1:18:44] left with 10 minutes I'm about to finish
[1:18:47] now I'm going to jump she had taken the
[1:18:49] wrong road she had two daughters and
[1:18:51] they were nice ladies and now and how
[1:18:53] she was uh this is paragraph 24 that I'm
[1:18:55] reading in the message Jubilee 56 09:16

[1:19:01] now and how there was with those two
[1:19:03] drunken men that afternoon I told her
[1:19:05] what the Lord Jesus had showed me and he
[1:19:07] still loved and I reached across the
[1:19:08] table caught her by the hands I said
[1:19:10] lady I don't care what you have done
[1:19:12] Christ still loves you right out of from
[1:19:14] behind that table she went in the middle
[1:19:17] of the floor the cop took off his hat
[1:19:20] and the all the rest of them and when

[1:19:33] men and and women to come back to Christ

[1:19:43] he was so holy he thought he was holier
[1:19:45] than thou but he see the smallest of
[1:19:48] sins that he had done they were causing
[1:19:51] the world to shake and and the W of God
[1:19:55] was coming down but thank God there was

[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:31] cell the devil will follow
[1:25:36] that the reason why I asked you to close

[1:26:47] that can
[1:26:49] follow there is no force of evil that
[1:26:51] can follow
[1:26:54] there is no power that can witchcraft
[1:26:55] that can
[1:26:57] follow there is no sin that can be under
[1:26:59] the
[1:27:01] blood and we have heard that you can
