[30:56] amen amen
[30:58] amen praise the
[31:00] Lord amen after the service
[31:04] tonight I'm going to the
[31:07] airport to pick our first
[31:11] guests
[31:13] amen I've hosted many
[31:17] people uh throughout my life and time in
[31:23] Ministry in Ethiopia and also here in
[31:26] Uganda
[31:27] but I've not seen
[31:30] anyone that the devil has fought with a
[31:35] magnitude like he has fought brother
[31:38] Timothy the devil has prevented him to
[31:41] come from the moment it was declared
[31:44] that he was
[31:46] coming and until
[31:48] recently his motherin-law took
[31:51] sick she was taken to the
[31:53] hospital I was in Kenya at the time in
[31:56] the meetings
[31:57] I spoke to the Believers and told them
[31:59] what was
[32:01] happening and we agreed together and
[32:03] prayed and uh she started
[32:06] improving and was removed from the
[32:09] hospital and uh and uh then then also
[32:12] his
[32:13] wife you know had some
[32:16] conditions and so he asked me to pray
[32:19] and he told me that if his mother in-law
[32:21] in the you know would not be fine then
[32:23] he would not be able to
[32:26] travel
[32:28] and so I said we are believing that God
[32:30] will heal
[32:31] her and so she came out of the
[32:34] hospital and so he took the he took the
[32:37] trip and uh yesterday in Europe in
[32:43] Geneva texted me and and told
[32:46] me that there was he actually sent me a
[32:50] picture there was a huge
[32:53] storm and I asked him is it not
[32:56] dangerous
[32:58] he said he doesn't know so that means it
[33:01] had the potential of being dangerous
[33:05] to you remember Jesus before he
[33:07] delivered that man who was in the tombs
[33:09] of
[33:12] gadara remember what happened a
[33:16] storm and so we see that when the devil
[33:19] raises a
[33:21] storm someone is getting ready to be
[33:24] deliver and so I I I prayed I was at
[33:28] home when he sent me that I was with
[33:31] brother Henry and brother martin so we
[33:35] were in the compound
[33:37] discussing that was last night right so
[33:40] we held hands and prayed and so he was
[33:43] able to get
[33:44] home and God calmed the
[33:47] storm and now he's telling me that his
[33:50] mother inlaw has been taken back to the
[33:53] HP and the devil is trying his best to
[33:56] stop him
[33:58] but I told the devil you are too
[34:00] late whatever you are
[34:03] hindering is not going to happen
[34:06] whatever you are
[34:07] hindering God cannot allow you to
[34:10] make praise the name of the Lord and so
[34:14] I heard him say he was on the flight to
[34:18] come that was the last message I heard
[34:20] from
[34:21] him and so tomorrow
[34:24] tonight after the service
[34:27] I'm receiving
[34:28] him and Brother

[42:51] the Affairs of this life that he may
[42:54] please him who has chosen him to be a
[43:13] [Music]
[43:25] soldier
[43:37] [Music]
[43:42] you may be seated please I'm happy to
[43:45] see you brother
[43:46] Baka I'm always happy to see you in
[43:50] church when I single out several
[43:54] people sometimes it is because because
[43:56] maybe I was thinking of them or praying
[43:57] for
[43:59] them so when I see them I'm
[44:01] happy so when I see you I'm
[44:04] happy
[44:06] hallelujah praise God and uh I like I
[44:11] told you I've been feeling like an
[44:14] evangelist today I had to call out was
[44:16] it today or yesterday I had to call out
[44:18] my
[44:20] daughter and I was evangelizing to her
[44:25] seriously things that uh this fire that
[44:28] is within my
[44:30] heart about what I believe that God
[44:34] desires for us as a
[44:39] generation and uh things that I believe
[44:42] that God wants us to
[44:46] do God wants a
[44:49] generation which will fear
[44:51] Him a generation that is going to
[44:54] desire after
[45:00] Holiness what generation will that
[45:03] be are people that will desire
[45:07] Holiness
[45:09] righteousness Desiring to please God and
[45:14] not did you know without
[45:17] Holiness you cannot see
[45:21] God God is Holy and he wants all of us
[45:24] to be holy
[45:27] and so this evening I'm sharing on
[45:29] entangling in the Affairs of this
[45:36] life and Paul writes to
[45:39] Timothy and he says Timothy my
[45:43] son be strong in the grace that is in
[45:45] Christ
[45:47] Jesus and the things that you have heard
[45:49] of me among many
[45:53] witnesses you know Paul had an Apostolic
[45:56] Grace upon
[45:59] him and there is something quite similar
[46:03] among all or most of the uh people who
[46:07] have the apostolic mantle upon
[46:14] them that they always want to be
[46:17] followed they always want to be
[46:20] hard because what they have is usually
[46:23] some kind of dispensational teaching
[46:28] that can revolutionize someone's
[46:33] life and fully and perfectly Chang
[46:37] it into uh some uh into something
[46:43] else and myself I fed from a
[46:48] Ministry that I believe was some kind of
[46:51] apostolic
[46:54] Ministry and I've never SE said this on
[46:56] pulit
[46:57] before but brother Eddie
[47:00] bisc mentored
[47:02] me you know I heard many things from
[47:05] him you know in text
[47:08] messages on emails and uh never would
[47:12] discuss and
[47:13] talk and sometimes he I don't know but
[47:16] whatever he wrote to
[47:19] me he it really I I should say changed
[47:23] my
[47:24] life sit under that
[47:27] Ministry and watch service after
[47:31] service and I can see my life right
[47:34] now completely
[47:37] changed my my my my aspirations in life
[47:42] Chang my ambitions and
[47:45] plans and we see here brother
[47:50] Paul also is talking to
[47:54] Timothy and says you have heard me speak
[47:58] things and I would want to you also to
[48:01] commit these things which you have heard
[48:03] me teach to Faithful
[48:06] [Music]
[48:09] Men shall also teach
[48:12] others and he says you should therefore
[48:16] endure
[48:20] hardness
[48:23] hardness and as a good
[48:26] so of Jesus Christ and now here is where
[48:31] I took my title out of verse
[48:34] four he says no man Warth entang no man
[48:39] that worth entangleth himself with the
[48:41] Affairs of this
[48:47] life that he may please him who has
[48:49] chosen him to be a
[48:53] soldier now when a Soldier is a
[48:57] soldier we have one in the
[49:00] church and you know that a
[49:03] soldier is someone that lives a
[49:05] dedicated
[49:08] life a soldier dedicates his life to a
[49:13] cause and without you know pursuing
[49:17] anything
[49:19] else he intentionally closes his
[49:24] mind
[49:26] to other
[49:27] things that are contrary to the
[49:32] cause many of many times are not even
[49:34] allowed to get
[49:36] married they discouraged from
[49:39] that others they discouraged for many
[49:42] things and when they training them they
[49:46] train them to follow
[49:49] instruction they follow them they they
[49:51] train them to
[49:52] obey they train them to submit
[49:55] [Music]
[49:57] to their
[49:59] Authority and when they when they pass
[50:02] the
[50:02] [Music]
[50:03] test then now they are
[50:06] graduated and now they positioned in a
[50:10] place it is not
[50:12] easy at the beginning of the year you
[50:14] had a brother omet giving a
[50:17] testimony on how it was difficult and
[50:20] how many others
[50:23] died in the course which they had
[50:25] embarked
[50:26] on and I want to say this friends we are
[50:30] also
[50:31] soldiers and we have been
[50:33] enlisted on the greatest army in the
[50:37] world right now people think the
[50:39] greatest army in the world is the US
[50:43] Army but I want to say the greatest army
[50:46] in the
[50:47] world is the army of the
[50:50] Lord are people that God has
[50:54] recruited people God has called out and
[50:58] he did not call out anybody and
[51:01] everybody he called specific
[51:06] people you know when they enlisting
[51:10] soldiers they have they have qualities
[51:13] they look
[51:15] at they cannot St someone who is very
[51:19] short they cannot take someone who does
[51:23] who does not have a good weight
[51:25] [Music]
[51:26] because they may die the chances of
[51:29] death in training are
[51:32] high so they have to look at you whether
[51:35] you are
[51:38] fit that is even before
[51:41] training and then when they enlist
[51:44] you then that means you are almost
[51:48] fit but then many
[51:51] die because the ones that enlist them
[51:55] are not
[51:56] sure about who they have
[51:59] chosen but now in our army the one that
[52:04] enls
[52:05] Us by calling us is sure about everybody
[52:10] that he
[52:10] [Music]
[52:12] calls sister peace he
[52:15] knows amen that when he chooses you you
[52:18] are going to amen go through the
[52:22] training however hard it is
[52:25] that's why he told him endure
[52:29] hardness however hard your training
[52:33] is however what you're going through is
[52:37] he said endure it endure it because you
[52:41] are a soldier and you are chosen to be a
[52:44] soldier and we are not chosen to be
[52:47] defeated we are chosen to
[52:49] fight and when we fight we must win the
[52:54] battle listen the battle we have our
[52:57] great
[52:59] enemy our greatest
[53:01] enemy is
[53:03] sin which is death which is the devil
[53:07] that is our great enemy and we here on
[53:10] Earth to
[53:12] war against our enemy to fight our enemy
[53:17] to overcome our enemy but is also an
[53:21] enemy that has been
[53:24] experienced
[53:25] for a long
[53:27] time he's not an
[53:29] amateur he knows what he's
[53:32] doing Satan has fought for a long
[53:35] time the Devils were are fighting they
[53:39] the same one that fought against
[53:42] Adam they fought against Eve they are
[53:46] the ones that even fought against
[53:50] Moses same
[53:53] Devils until the man of God
[53:56] said may God rebuke
[53:59] you to those
[54:01] Devils some devils that Joshua fought
[54:05] against some devils that even our lord
[54:08] Jesus fought against they are not new
[54:13] demons same demons same Devils that
[54:17] brother bam fought
[54:19] against would come and CH demons out of
[54:23] people and when he goes to his room
[54:25] hotel
[54:26] room they would be waiting for
[54:29] him to torment him some
[54:33] Demon we are not fting new
[54:40] demons it is a demon it is not a new
[54:44] demon it has been here for ages let me
[54:48] tell you the same some Demon have been
[54:53] defeated many many times
[54:56] many many
[54:57] times Hallelujah and if they were
[54:59] defeated
[55:01] before be defeated
[55:04] again and I believe I am one of those
[55:08] that is born here on Earth to bring all
[55:11] hell to that these demons we are talking
[55:16] about there are people listen listen
[55:21] what I'm saying whether you feel it or
[55:24] you don't feel it
[55:26] it is the
[55:27] truth there are some people who are born
[55:31] on the Earth that we are meant to be
[55:34] enlisted on this
[55:37] Army and all these people were born
[55:41] under that
[55:43] sign that they must
[55:45] defeat all hell they must defeat all
[55:51] demons they must defeat all sin they
[55:55] must
[55:56] defeat death Temptation they must defeat
[56:01] last they must defeat whatever demons it
[56:05] is even
[56:07] sickness did you know sickness are
[56:12] demons there are people who are born
[56:16] that were never going to be overcome by
[56:23] deathu Hallelujah
[56:25] people who can never
[56:28] die why because they have died
[56:31] already the moment they received Jesus
[56:35] Christ they were dead therefore they
[56:39] cannot die
[56:40] again so death can never take
[56:43] me death cannot carry me
[56:46] away that's why apost Paul
[56:49] shout and he
[56:51] said where is your
[56:53] victory victory has no
[56:56] death to a Believer who has been
[57:00] enlisted on this Army he is a soldier
[57:04] and he's a warrior and he's a
[57:07] defeater of demons he's a devil
[57:13] stomper I am one of them if you're one
[57:16] of them you can say I am one
[57:18] of I am one of them even if you're
[57:21] feeling like you are
[57:23] defeated amen you believe in thus sayth
[57:26] the
[57:28] Lord that I am one of
[57:32] them you
[57:33] know when when when soldiers are going
[57:36] to
[57:37] fight usually a captain comes
[57:40] up and he begins charging
[57:44] them speaking words speaking words and
[57:49] even the ones who are feeling like they
[57:50] defeated they begin to say no no we are
[57:53] going to consume our
[57:56] that's why we come for a
[57:58] preaching we are an army of
[58:01] soldiers and a preacher comes to
[58:04] motivate us to remind us who we are to
[58:08] tell us brother we are going to overcome
[58:13] eny don't don't be overcome don't be
[58:16] fearful don't shy away don't hide your
[58:20] face stand straight and look in the face
[58:24] of your enemy
[58:25] stand straight and look in the face of
[58:28] your
[58:29] Temptation and tell him devil I am here
[58:33] I am born to defeat you I am born to
[58:36] defeat you I am born to overcome you I
[58:39] am born to be a
[58:41] coner because he that is a
[58:43] conquer is in me and if in me there is
[58:48] more than all the demons put
[58:50] [Music]
[58:51] together and the Bible here says endure
[58:55] sadness endure hardness
[59:00] rather as a good soldier of Jesus
[59:03] Christ Hallelujah
[59:05] soldiers amen
[59:07] soldiers soldiers always
[59:12] answer Hallelujah when they told to say
[59:16] they
[59:17] [Music]
[59:18] say hallelujah amen
[59:21] soldiers We Are Soldiers of J Christ oh
[59:26] my I love that brother we are in a
[59:32] battle we have to
[59:34] over whatever the devil will do let him
[59:38] be there
[59:40] and we must over this
[59:44] battle no man
[59:47] wor and Tangle himself with the Affairs
[59:50] of this
[59:52] life that's what I'm talking about today
[59:55] if God permits me entangling in the
[59:58] Affairs of this
[1:00:01] life we
[1:00:03] soldiers but the problem of it
[1:00:05] is many people desire to
[1:00:12] entangle into the Affairs of this
[1:00:15] life you cannot win your
[1:00:19] enemy if you are
[1:00:22] entangling in the Affairs of this
[1:00:25] when soldiers go to Afghanistan to
[1:00:28] fight they have no time to use
[1:00:33] WhatsApp they have no time for
[1:00:36] jokes everybody and anybody around them
[1:00:39] is an
[1:00:40] enemy a potential
[1:00:43] enemy so they always on high
[1:00:46] L knowing anybody could be an
[1:00:50] enemy and someone could be a
[1:00:52] terrorist so they're going to be on high
[1:00:56] alarm but the Church of Jesus Christ is
[1:01:00] sleeping they are supposed to be
[1:01:02] soldiers but we are not on high
[1:01:05] L we don't pray
[1:01:07] anymore we don't cry after God we don't
[1:01:11] seek after
[1:01:12] God we don't read
[1:01:15] Bible if you a Christian and you don't
[1:01:17] read your
[1:01:19] Bible you can never live an overcoming
[1:01:23] life we don't read the
[1:01:26] Bible we we used to sing read your Bible
[1:01:29] and pray every
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:32] day but this is never done
[1:01:35] anymore some Believers even don't have
[1:01:39] Bibles now let me talk to you who don't
[1:01:42] have a
[1:01:43] Bible and you think you are a
[1:01:46] soldier how can you be a
[1:01:48] soldier without a
[1:01:51] sword how do you know know when soldiers
[1:01:55] go to
[1:01:56] battle their gun is their
[1:02:00] life and if their life has been taken
[1:02:04] away from
[1:02:05] them they are considered
[1:02:08] dead they tell them if you fall down
[1:02:11] fall
[1:02:12] down but protect your
[1:02:15] G this is your
[1:02:17] life let don't let your enemy
[1:02:20] touch this is your lifeline and I want
[1:02:23] to say the same
[1:02:25] this is our
[1:02:26] life the word of God is our
[1:02:29] life but do we read it or do we just
[1:02:33] have it but if you don't have a Bible
[1:02:36] and you don't even have a
[1:02:39] h I believe no one in this church
[1:02:42] especially should claim that you don't
[1:02:44] have a
[1:02:46] Bible because I believe everybody should
[1:02:48] have a
[1:02:49] Bible and if you don't have a Bible come
[1:02:51] we shall buy you a
[1:02:53] Bible

[1:03:07] doesn't have a Bible in the youth

[1:03:12] Bible I'm telling you and you cannot
[1:03:15] claim that you don't have a
[1:03:17] Bible you don't want to have
[1:03:20] one but God will always raise
[1:03:23] somebody if you don't have a sword God
[1:03:27] will arm
[1:03:28] you he will arm
[1:03:31] you because he needs you to fight and
[1:03:34] the Bible is one of our
[1:03:36] arms and we should fight with it read

[1:06:14] happy until we are carried
[1:06:17] away we begin
[1:06:19] shouting We Begin clapping our we begin
[1:06:23] to feel so sweet
[1:06:25] we sing and sing and sing until we are
[1:06:30] drunk you know it's a s
[1:06:32] atmosphere you sing until you
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:36] prophesy you sing until you speak
[1:06:40] in you sing you know but these days no
[1:06:44] one has time for
[1:06:45] it when you begin a song you begin
[1:06:49] seeing one of one by one going
[1:06:52] away where are they going
[1:06:54] they are going to entangle into the
[1:06:56] Affairs of this
[1:06:58] life everybody is
[1:07:01] busy no hunger no thirst no
[1:07:05] desire no
[1:07:07] pool towards the things of
[1:07:10] God that's a sign of
[1:07:13] backsliding It's a Sign you know what do
[1:07:16] they do when they go
[1:07:18] out you know when they together they're
[1:07:21] just doing you know rumors
[1:07:25] talking this and that did you hear this
[1:07:27] did you see this did you see that did
[1:07:31] you what hear what the pastor say they
[1:07:33] begin talking negative
[1:07:36] things about fellow
[1:07:38] brothers about
[1:07:40] sisters they begin talking about what
[1:07:43] went wrong in the
[1:07:45] church and they can never be among those
[1:07:47] who will bring the
[1:07:50] solutions why because they're entangling
[1:07:53] themselves
[1:07:55] into the Affairs of this life so then
[1:07:58] how can you be a good
[1:08:01] soldier you know all these things I've
[1:08:03] been talking
[1:08:04] about these are tools that can make us
[1:08:09] busy we can become so busy that we don't
[1:08:12] have time for
[1:08:14] B you don't need a pastor to tell you to
[1:08:17] you know do Bible
[1:08:20] study or to tell to hear the message or
[1:08:23] to to go and do
[1:08:25] evangelism I was never
[1:08:29] bored growing up in in this
[1:08:32] message I believe it when I was 15
[1:08:35] years I was just a
[1:08:37] boy but I'm telling you what did what
[1:08:40] what did we used to do you know just go
[1:08:43] up and
[1:08:45] about with nothing about about this
[1:08:48] message brother Dixon we used to tell
[1:08:51] people God sent a
[1:08:52] prophet we were not shying away from it
[1:08:56] we were not
[1:08:58] ashamed but you see what the thing of it
[1:09:02] is the young people are now
[1:09:05] ashamed of standing with what they
[1:09:10] believe do you know if you are not
[1:09:13] concerned you are not
[1:09:17] convinced but anybody who is
[1:09:20] concerned you will be convinced
[1:09:24] about telling
[1:09:26] others about this message I rarely went
[1:09:30] to church
[1:09:34] alone I always picked a friend in the
[1:09:37] week and I would share with them the
[1:09:41] message and prepare them up to the
[1:09:45] level where now they are ready to hear
[1:09:48] the
[1:09:49] preaching and I would bring them to
[1:09:51] church you know and when while the
[1:09:54] pastor is
[1:09:55] preaching I would be on fire not really
[1:09:58] for
[1:09:59] myself but for my
[1:10:01] friend whenever the pastor hit some
[1:10:05] Nots that I had already discussed with
[1:10:07] my friend I look at him like this I T on
[1:10:11] him are you hearing are you hearing
[1:10:15] because I was
[1:10:16] excited about this message and when you
[1:10:20] are excited about the
[1:10:21] message you are going to share it
[1:10:24] others let us come out of our comfort
[1:10:27] zones let us leave those borom
[1:10:30] things and let us be you know on
[1:10:34] fire let us not be
[1:10:37] entangled I never watched
[1:10:40] football I never went to movie
[1:10:44] theaters I never you know went to
[1:10:48] bar I never went to
[1:10:51] lud what was I using my time with
[1:10:54] I was using it to
[1:10:57] evangelize speak to my friends one by
[1:11:01] one I was you know studying the
[1:11:06] message I would take a book and read the
[1:11:10] message while I am taking notes you know
[1:11:14] it's not because I was a
[1:11:16] preacher but it was a desire to know
[1:11:19] more of
[1:11:20] God and I believe each of us can do
[1:11:25] imagine if each of us did that we would
[1:11:28] have a big time
[1:11:31] Revival among
[1:11:33] everybody we would have no time for boy
[1:11:37] girl
[1:11:39] relationships until we are ready for
[1:11:42] marriage we would have no time for
[1:11:46] wasting but if you are
[1:11:49] Idol the devil will have a lot to bring
[1:11:52] your away
[1:11:54] and I don't
[1:11:56] mind is a devil's
[1:11:59] worksh the devil will come to you and
[1:12:02] bring
[1:12:03] ideas and then you will agree with them
[1:12:07] because you have too much
[1:12:09] time because you bored so the devil will
[1:12:13] make you
[1:12:14] busy but I don't know about you as far
[1:12:17] as I'm concerned I don't want the devil
[1:12:20] to make me busy I don't want to be
[1:12:22] entangled in the
[1:12:25] I want to be entangled in the Affairs of
[1:12:28] the
[1:12:30] Kingdom what I'm speaking about I'm
[1:12:33] talking about the life that is
[1:12:36] coming let me tell you life is coming
[1:12:40] but also fire is
[1:12:42] coming what will it be for
[1:12:44] you you know we have to make a
[1:12:47] choice every one of us young people
[1:12:51] especially when you are still young you
[1:12:54] make a choice what will it be for
[1:12:57] you will it be life or
[1:13:01] fire as far as I'm concerned I made a
[1:13:04] choice it is going to be life and
[1:13:08] everything I do the friends I met to
[1:13:12] help me keep the
[1:13:14] life not entangling
[1:13:16] myself in their Affairs in their things
[1:13:21] because I'm a soldier I'm a soldier of
[1:13:25] the army of the Lord I am going to
[1:13:28] overcome I am not going to accept defeat
[1:13:31] I'm going to overcome I'm going to fight
[1:13:35] I am not going to be
[1:13:37] entangle I am
[1:13:39] intentional I am intentional in
[1:13:41] everything I'm
[1:13:43] doing and that's how each of us should
[1:13:48] be but false
[1:13:51] teachers will not tell you that
[1:13:54] first teachers in second Peter
[1:14:00] 2:8 the Bible speaks of them this
[1:14:03] ways when they speak great swearing
[1:14:05] words of
[1:14:07] vanity they Allure they Allure through
[1:14:10] the lust of the flesh through much
[1:14:15] wanton those that were
[1:14:18] clean escaped from them who live in
[1:14:21] error p
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:44] while they promis them Liberty they
[1:14:47] themselves are the Servants of
[1:14:49] corruption for of whom a man is overcome
[1:14:53] of the same is he brought in
[1:15:09] bondage shall come to that for if after
[1:15:12] they have escaped the pollutions of the
[1:15:14] world through the knowledge of the Lord
[1:15:16] and Savior Jesus Christ they are again
[1:15:18] entangled therein and overcome the
[1:15:22] latter end is worse with them than the
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:45] beginning for it had been better for
[1:15:47] them not to have known the way of
[1:15:48] righteousness than after they have known
[1:15:51] it to turn from the holy commandment
[1:15:53] delivered unto them but it is happened
[1:15:56] unto them according to the true proverb
[1:15:58] the dog is is turned to his own vomit
[1:16:01] again and the soul that was washed to
[1:16:04] her wallowing in the
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:22] m
[1:16:40] now this is a very good Evangelistic
[1:16:45] text let me read for you this portion
[1:16:48] the same portion in the Amplified
[1:16:52] Bible
[1:16:53] Verse 18 for uttering loud basts of
[1:17:00] folly they
[1:17:01] beguile and lure with lustful desires of
[1:17:05] the flesh those who are barely escaping
[1:17:08] from them who are
[1:17:11] wrongdoers they they they beguile and
[1:17:14] lure lustful
[1:17:18] desires yes those who are barely
[1:17:22] escaping from them
[1:17:26] who are
[1:17:27] wrongdoers they promise them
[1:17:30] Liberty when they themselves are the
[1:17:33] slaves of De
[1:17:36] privity and
[1:17:38] defilement what good is it for a
[1:17:40] preacher to preach to you Liberty
[1:17:42] Freedom
[1:17:46] power but when you know you are on your
[1:17:48] way to
[1:17:50] hell when you know your life is not
[1:17:52] right with
[1:17:54] God but he says these people they
[1:17:56] promise them
[1:17:58] Liberty when they themselves as slaves
[1:18:02] of De privity and
[1:18:06] defilement for by whatever anyone is
[1:18:09] made inferior or
[1:18:14] worse or is
[1:18:17] overcome to that person or thing is
[1:18:21] enslaved
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:26] if it is
[1:18:28] money if you become a slave if if money
[1:18:32] overcomes
[1:18:33] you if the love and the last for
[1:18:37] it if you become inferior to
[1:18:41] it are you hearing me church if you
[1:18:44] become inferior to
[1:18:46] money the last and the love of
[1:18:50] it then you become a slave of you become
[1:18:52] a slave
[1:18:55] if you become a slave if you if you you
[1:18:58] are under that
[1:19:01] desire that last full desire for
[1:19:05] something for anything it may be
[1:19:09] anything it may be an idea or even a
[1:19:12] person it may be anything but when you
[1:19:16] accept to become
[1:19:19] inferior to become something come take
[1:19:23] away anything but leave
[1:19:26] this when they touch that they have
[1:19:29] touched your heart you stop functioning
[1:19:32] the Bible says you have become a
[1:19:35] slave and we see in the world we are
[1:19:38] living
[1:19:39] now people are slaves to many
[1:19:42] things people are slaves to
[1:19:45] football people are slaves to
[1:19:48] movies people are
[1:19:50] slaves you know to games
[1:19:55] whereby someone ask me is it a
[1:19:57] sin let me tell you if it's not a sin I
[1:20:02] ask you something are you above it or
[1:20:05] are you under
[1:20:09] it anything if it is above
[1:20:13] you if it is not Jesus it is a
[1:20:17] sin anything it may even be a wife or
[1:20:21] husband but if it's above
[1:20:24] you more than Jesus Jesus should take
[1:20:28] the first
[1:20:30] priority in your life but we see they
[1:20:33] overtaken by
[1:20:35] this some people they submit to
[1:20:39] last you know and then they be these
[1:20:41] restful
[1:20:43] desires begin to rule over them and they
[1:20:46] become a slave to
[1:20:48] them you know they will submit to these
[1:20:51] desires
[1:20:53] that is entangling
[1:20:56] yourself in the Affairs of this
[1:20:59] life but as a good
[1:21:02] soldier nothing should be above
[1:21:05] you but you're a
[1:21:08] commander and our war
[1:21:11] Captain our
[1:21:13] commander is Jesus Christ is the word of
[1:21:17] God it should be the only thing above
[1:21:20] us everything else below us
[1:21:23] everything else should not rule over
[1:21:25] us but where you let a
[1:21:28] situation a condition it may even be a
[1:21:32] condition you are
[1:21:34] in or a
[1:21:37] thought and then you are troubled by
[1:21:40] him you are troubled by
[1:21:42] him until you can no longer think
[1:21:47] straight many people get into
[1:21:51] depression why
[1:21:53] because they have become a
[1:21:55] slave to that
[1:21:58] thought can you imagine many people can
[1:22:01] I have a thought that see I am not
[1:22:08] beautiful that's just a thought I am not
[1:22:12] beautiful and then the devil will take
[1:22:14] that
[1:22:15] thought and will
[1:22:18] slowly drag you under that thought
[1:22:25] and then you will not think anything
[1:22:28] else but that you are
[1:22:31] angry when someone looks at
[1:22:34] you you feel bad oh they looking at how
[1:22:39] they are looking at how ugly I
[1:22:42] am oh they looking at how little or
[1:22:45] small I
[1:22:47] am or they're looking at how bad I look
[1:22:53] you have become a
[1:22:55] slave to that little
[1:22:58] thought and that's entangling
[1:23:01] yourself in the matters of this life
[1:23:05] listen I don't care whether I'm
[1:23:08] beautiful
[1:23:09] ugly
[1:23:11] handsome tall short I am a
[1:23:14] soldier I have a fight to
[1:23:17] fight I have a battle to win I don't
[1:23:21] care about how I lost these are matters
[1:23:23] of this life I have a
[1:23:27] restaurant and you see many people are
[1:23:29] overtaken by those
[1:23:31] things that's why women you will find
[1:23:34] them painting
[1:23:36] themselves you will find them you know
[1:23:39] even changing their skin
[1:23:43] color they bleach
[1:23:45] it I'm so black oh goodness I'm so
[1:23:50] black I'm so black and they become a
[1:23:53] slave to
[1:23:54] that and the devil tells them now
[1:23:56] because you're so black bleach
[1:23:59] yourself and they begin
[1:24:01] bleaching I'm so black they become a
[1:24:06] slave why now at that
[1:24:09] moment they are becoming a
[1:24:12] slave and they entangling
[1:24:15] themselves into matters
[1:24:18] Affairs they're losing
[1:24:20] focus when brings a
[1:24:23] blow a bullet it will come
[1:24:27] straight because you are
[1:24:29] distracted many times we are defeated in
[1:24:32] this
[1:24:33] life not because God is not with
[1:24:36] us but because we are
[1:24:40] distracted even a good
[1:24:43] driver can
[1:24:45] knock if they are
[1:24:49] distracted if you look at this or that
[1:24:52] times it is people who will come in your
[1:24:55] life and I tell you without me you are
[1:24:59] nothing without me you are gone without
[1:25:02] me there is no future for you I am your
[1:25:05] blessing if you don't have me you a c
[1:25:09] that is a matter of this
[1:25:12] life I am not going to accept to be a
[1:25:15] slave of any
[1:25:17] man I am only a slave of Jesus Christ
[1:25:22] where he leads me I follow where he
[1:25:25] takes me I go I am only a slave of Jesus
[1:25:29] I am a sold in
[1:25:35] theallu my
[1:25:37] destiny is in his hands no man can
[1:25:40] control it no man can control as long as
[1:25:44] you are in the will of
[1:25:46] God no man can control your
[1:25:49] Destin and some people will come to you
[1:25:51] and say
[1:25:54] words that are very
[1:25:56] sharp maybe some of you are
[1:25:58] here and someone has spoken to you sharp
[1:26:01] things until you cannot go away from
[1:26:06] them and then whatever you do it fails
[1:26:09] to
[1:26:10] prosper then you
[1:26:12] say that person cast
[1:26:14] me for sure it
[1:26:18] worked let me try this and I see maybe I
[1:26:23] will prosper it doesn't work
[1:26:27] out the C is working on
[1:26:30] me you are a
[1:26:32] slave it's a
[1:26:34] thought maybe you you committed a
[1:26:37] sin in your life and it it you know you
[1:26:42] repented of it but the devil knows your
[1:26:47] memory is not like God's
[1:26:50] memory God forgets every sin that is
[1:26:54] under the
[1:26:55] blood but you
[1:26:57] don't and the devil
[1:27:00] doesn't that's the only thing we have in
[1:27:02] common with the
[1:27:06] devil and he will come to you tormenting
[1:27:09] you say ah I think I'm
[1:27:13] cured I know what I did before I
[1:27:17] believe I know I'm under a cur I can't
[1:27:21] come out of this situ
[1:27:23] let me tell you you are a slave you have
[1:27:26] no freedom because you are enslaved by
[1:27:29] that thing which has made you
[1:27:32] INF it has overcome you it may be last
[1:27:36] or last full
[1:27:37] desire it may be a thought like I mean
[1:27:41] this area of life where you become
[1:27:46] enslaved for if after they have escaped
[1:27:49] pollutions of the world through the you
[1:27:52] you know the full personal knowledge of
[1:27:53] the Lord Jesus
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:58] Christ
[1:27:59] and listen church we Are Soldiers
[1:28:02] remember don't allow any
[1:28:05] thoughts to enslave you don't allow any
[1:28:10] mind of the devil to enslave you
[1:28:14] whatever is under the blood is under the
[1:28:18] blood whatever you have walked away from
[1:28:21] it not amen you know change your
[1:28:26] destiny the moment you met
[1:28:29] Jesus things
[1:28:31] changed our destiny was changed and from
[1:28:35] that
[1:28:36] moment the past cannot affect
[1:28:40] you Jesus does not come just make us
[1:28:44] better
[1:28:46] people he comes to change
[1:28:50] everything he you know a soldier is
[1:28:57] timed
[1:28:58] changed change the
[1:29:01] timing they change the
[1:29:05] trajectory when Jesus comes you have to
[1:29:08] be
[1:29:10] changed are you hearing me you know the
[1:29:13] way you think it has to be changeed
[1:29:17] that's why some people they say is
[1:29:20] brainwashing oh yeah it is brainwashing
[1:29:24] because we are
[1:29:27] recruited in the greatest
[1:29:29] army it is an Elite
[1:29:32] Force where our mind has to be
[1:29:35] changed where our mind has to be
[1:29:39] renew whereby we are no longer
[1:29:42] under the thoughts that rule
[1:29:46] over we are being ruled
[1:29:49] over by a higher thought
[1:29:53] which
[1:29:54] thought the thought of the
[1:29:56] world where he says I know the thoughts
[1:30:00] I have toward
[1:30:02] you thoughts of good and not of evil I
[1:30:07] thoughts of
[1:30:08] prosperity the thought of God
[1:30:11] is your mind is tuned
[1:30:16] different oh my
[1:30:20] God
[1:30:22] and he says here we have
[1:30:26] escaped after we have
[1:30:28] escaped the pollutions of the world
[1:30:30] through the full personal
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:36] knowledge
[1:30:43] of they again after they have done
[1:30:47] that they again become
[1:30:50] entangled
[1:30:52] in those
[1:30:53] thoughts in them and are
[1:30:59] overcome that's the problem and that's
[1:31:02] what I'm talking about today many
[1:31:05] Believers after
[1:31:07] believing then they reach somewhere and
[1:31:10] they
[1:31:11] again are
[1:31:15] overcome and they get
[1:31:18] entangled and the Bible says when that
[1:31:20] happens their last
[1:31:24] condition is
[1:31:26] worse for them than the
[1:31:29] first rather if you have decided to be a
