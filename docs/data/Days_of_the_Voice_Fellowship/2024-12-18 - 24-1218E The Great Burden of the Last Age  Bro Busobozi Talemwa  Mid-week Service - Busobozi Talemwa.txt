has arrived and also brother Ken uh actually brother brother s told me he um he he had a chance to lay off a little bit in this Ababa and he was able to meet I think one or two Believers there just

very very bad and our car broke down but the Lord just brought us back safely amen we traveled with those two ministers and also with brother and his wife and also by the praise so thank you for your prayers amen amen shall we now turn to the word this evening we are reading out of the Book of Revelation chapter 2s 24 we just read one verse and then we shall be seated but unto you I say and unto the rest in th as manyas have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depths of Saturn as they speak I will put upon you none other burden amen you may be seated my voice is not fully back yet um so pray for me this evening amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tell your neighbor you happy there amen amen how many enjoyed the song leading of brother am praise the Lord amen God has more young people who are not only willing but they also able to serve you and God is Raising more amen I'd like you to be in prayer for us uh tomorrow the Lord willing we have some baptisms to do in um sister the sister I told you of the Nigerian sister she was able to witness to a few of the people there this this one you know had about Us by the interview we did about the [Music] cosmas and she came down at my house and we had some fellowship she's um she's she was moved by this enti message she's been streaming her Services I'm pretty sure she might be on right now and so uh she has a few people that also would like to be baptized and also herself she she would also want to be [Music] baptized so uh those are very good news when you hear people who uh have a desire of receiving the word those are very good news amen and you're not happy with that we should really be happy with that so then that sister that group um and they all you know close to and then the group that B has been reaching out to uh and you know so those are the people that are really um uh leading us to you know have a burden for the city and the Lord willing tomorrow we will try and and and conclude uh the arrangement of getting that place where we shall be fellowshipping [Music] them you know that place already there is a a church that fellowships there it's a school hall so um they but the administration is ready to also have us because that that group only comes on Sunday morning so we thought what we can do is we can do an evening or maybe like a Thursday evening and also a Sunday afternoon so we will be uh collecting an offering uh for for helping us to acquire maybe a few chairs and also um you know maybe like a Pian piano um I think we need um um you can say about 1.5 million uh to acquire those things so those who are willing and you know to pledge or to WR away give something towards that no cause we will do that after the service when and collect that offering you know the Bible says that until this gospel is preached the uttermost parts of the Earth the end shall not come so we have to bring in every last one and whatever we can do for the Lord let us do it let us do it we do not know how much we have here on Earth we are not trying to build a kingdom our own we we are furing the kingdom of God and we sent to do that how many believe that so in every little way that you can do it maybe by Prayer by giving by going to do something if you can witness do what you can do and and let us father the kingdom of God so this evening I want to speak on the great burden of the last Age The Great burden of the last age you know um I was looking at um we were having a conversation at my dining table with a few of our my young men brother Ken as well as pastor and you know we were talking generally about the age we are living in and brother Ken shared a quote which we are going to begin with and I thought that was very interesting and I thought I should share it with church from thean church age it says now before we go into the promise let me show again that the church has spoken by of of by the spirit in this book has two Vines whose interwinding branches composite but I say unto you and to the rest in as many as have not this Doctrine there it is he is speaking of the two groups one has the doctrine the for Doctrine another does not there they are scattered BR across the nations with each other's Doctrine opposing the other one is of God knowing his depths the other of Satan knowing the depth of Saturn now put it I'll put upon you none other burden so the word for burden is weight or pressure and later on brother bam would go on to show that every age has had has had its press you know I believe from the age from the very first age and here we are in the age called they also had their pressures he says the you know these were the dark edges he says the pressure of the dark edges was either Bend or be broken bow bow or die it was the Inquisition the power of the Empire backing up satanic worship praise the name of the Lord be organized open with your life remember th was the age of of the dominating female where you know the truth was almost completely removed from the earth you know the people you know the try Doctrine was was you know taken all over the world there was a church which which boasted to be the mother Church the Roman Catholic church and you see everybody else who did not support it all the doctrines of that false Church died they were killed you know they were taken in arenas imagine you know and then they would release dogs and and before they release them they'll tell them how many are willing to recount their faith and you know these women would would would refuse and the men would refuse they would say we would rather die and you see so they would take the women and open up their bellies with child and they would take out the babies and throw it to the to the Lions and and and and you know and you know they would leave them to bleed it was very bad but you know these women and children and Men did it for one reason because of what they believe and you see they would do it to one woman and she would see the pain that the other woman has gone through and they would come to her and ask her are you ready to save yourself and recount no I cannot you see there was an anointing upon them amen you know they had anointing upon them they were ready to die they were ready to risk it all the pressure which they had in their generation in their age was you know the Bowing to the organized religion I'm imagining if they can you know tell one of you you know bring a pistol and say whether you just join the Catholic church or you die I don't know how many I would remain with in the church but you see that's not even the only pressure of our age for them that's that was their pressure you know they had to make up their mind they had to bow or die you know it was banned to be broken but you see the Believers the True Believers of in that age they stood the test of time they overcame they stood with the word and those who were weaklings who did not have a backbone they bowed down and you know they then they did not die they accepted the false Doctrine they accepted to believe the false religion and the organized religion and be a part of it and they thought they were saving themselves but you see by doing that they died eternally but the Believers who died they gave their life's blood they will live eternally and those were the Bride of that age they overcame the pressure in their age even if it caused them to die they overcame it was a pressure you know it was a burden in their age but they were willing to pay the price they had a backbone they were willing to stand for the word and overcome the pressure of their but we see he says each age had its precious for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches this is the burden of our age the pressure of riches if I asked here how many have an ambition of being rich all hands will go up it's the Press of edge not only that but also a pressure for soft living oh I'm going to talk about those things today and also another third thing the pressure for nervous tensions pressure of riches and N tensions in a complex age that we seem united we we seem unfitted to live in but you see if God sold fit for us to live in this age he will give us the grace to overcome in thisen when the spirit of the of the Devil comes in like a flag God Spirit come comes in and lifts up a standard the Believers of every age the Overcomers the bride in every age is the Overcomer she's the True Vine and she overcomes and lives above what the others are defeated in the bride in that age she will overcome so I don't care how many pressures have defeated others I am not in this age to be defeated like they are defeated I am in this age to overcome the pressures of my age I am going to live above it Hallelujah I am going to overcome I am going to be the Overcomer and you know the Overcomers in this age the Bible says to them that shall overcome I will give it to them to sit with me on my throne even as I overcame and sat down with my father on his throne the Overcomers of this age are going to rule hallelujah hallelujah amen now let us look at the pressures of this St Revelation 3 and may God help us to design these things as we go through them chapter 3: 17 now I cannot I'll not read the whole chapter but um it is speaking about from from vers 14 but I'm going to read only 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked the people in this generation the people inia they have this testimony that they are rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing you know we have a big pressure for riches whereby people will miss church because they're looking for money and the money they are looking for they will never find they seem to be running after something that is difficult to catch they more they run after eat the more difficult it is for them to catch the pressure for riches we have all these casinos L programs you know they go there why because you know this thing has come in our generation why everybody wants to be rich and to be rich fast H they don't want to invest time in their finding of riches when it comes to finding money they can do anything including Living Church including abandoning Fellowship including you know someone gets a job and it is it is 200 km from away from church and it's going to this place doesn't care whether they will go to church or not as long as I'm getting money you know it is a very weird generation whereby money has become the god of the people amen instead of church bringing them close to church money is taking them far away from church you find the priorities of the people how many of you if you called for a deal just during the church service deal for 1 million shs how many of you will choose to go to church service it's a question that you should be able to answer then you can know whether you are bowing down to the pressures of our age or whether you are overcoming what is more important to you is it attending a service or going out to get the 1 million church is always there but this money is a deal that's why people come to church and they still take a phone calls they leave the phone on vibration because they are under pressure they want money they're waiting for someone who will call them they have made a deal and they know they have to be at church so you just don't wor to call me because whether I'm at church or not this deal must not pass you see they are not prioritizing God and that's why God is not revealing himself to them in a mighty way it is the pressure of the age and um I'm going to read out I'm going to do a lot of reading tonight so just follow me in he says now look at the first phrase of this verse because thou sayest see they were speaking they were talking as the mouthpiece of God this proves exactly what I said in verse 16 to 17 but they say it but but though they say it though they say they are rich that that does not make it right the Catholic Church says she speaks for God saying she is the assured voice of the Lord how many people can be so spiritually Wicked is more than I [Music] know but they produce according to the seed which is in them and we know where the seed came from thean church saying I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing that was her self-esteem the church inia is boasting for having so much riches follow closely now she looked at herself and that is what she saw she said I am rich which means that she is wealthy in the things of this world she is bursting in the face of gemes she's boasting in the face of this scripture in the Book of James chapter 2 I wanted to see what J said chter 2: 5 Heen my beloved you have the verse yes yes Heen my beloved Brethren has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith let me read again has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith what is the poorest country on Earth they said what's the most spiritual country on Earth Cong do you know the church the the country which has the biggest um number of message Believers in the world the world as one country but the poorest Pastor are you preaching us to be poor today just just follow me follow me today so James says God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and haers of the Kingdom which he has promised to them that love him but ye have despised the poor imagine if a brother walks in here poor a poor brother some people don't even want to greet him but when you know a brother or a sister is Rich everybody wants to greet her or him oh sister oh God bless you because you know they have money so somehow you think that you will also maybe they will give you some and some people are very weird very cunning when they see someone coming to church and this someone is loaded with C when we come start pledging this person pledges a lot and gives a lot some people they are very good at strategizing you know they will go to them privately you see me don't didn't you see how song read God has blessed me but but my brother I'm having an issue ah I'm squeezed with life just borrow me some money money and and I promise oh don't worry brother and you see they use you know but this is all over is a spirit of the [Music] age I want to open your eyes to this and I hope after this service many will understand what it means to be a believer to overcome the burden the pressure of this last age and haers of the Kingdom which he has promised to them that love him but ye have despise the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the Judgment seats do not they blashe that worthy that worthy Name by which ye are called and the prophet says now I do not suggest that a rich person cannot be spiritual but we all know that the word says very few [Music] are very few rich men and women are spiritual it is the poor that predominate in the body of the true church in the body of Christ the majority are poor [Music] well this is your Prophet you better say amen and a big one it is the poor that predominate in the body of the true church many Believers that I know are struggling now then if the church becomes full of wealth we only know one thing EAB you know what EAB means the glory is departed has been written over you cannot deny that so that is the word now let's talk about wealth in the church why there never has been such a show of wealth the beautiful Sanctuary he says why there never has been a show of wealth rather that's what he meant yes yes yes meaning at the age of the age we are living in is the age that has showed great wealth in the church compared to all other ages you know our age it is the age that shown great wealth never has been a show of wealth like [Music] today the beautiful sanctuaries they multiplied in number as never before the sanctu is churches the beautiful churches you just go and move around all the churches that were so small and Tiny and looking doesn't matter which religion just go and look around they all Bu The Magnificent build beautiful sanctuaries they have money this is the age which has money even right over here there's one denomination that has built a very beautiful Sanctuary it's a great show of wealth the various groups viy with each other to see who can build the biggest and the lovest everybody who builds they say ours is the most beautiful in the city ours is the most beautiful in the country and they build Education Centers worth unestimated millions and those buildings are used only one hour or two in a week now that would not be that would not be such a terrible thing but they expect this little time spent by the children in the education plant to take the place of the hours of training supposed to be given in [Music] the what what it means that the age we are living in you know parents hand over their children to the school and they expect that the school has trained them over they no longer need to train their children I'm trying to show you by going through this that you see our age has lost the backbone our age has become so weak our age has bound down to the the precious but how many shall overcome money has powered into the church until different denominations own stocks and bonds factories oil wells and insurance companies they have powered money into the welfare and retirement funds now this sounds good you know Church come they come together and they have retirement funds they have welfare funds so if you're a part of the church a member of that church then you know you are a beneficiary you understand many churches have this program and they those these programs are not bad not even the way said it they work and they put their fund they put money to that fund they have a fund they build a fund where by you know when you retire you can always get like retirement funds welfare to help those who need help now this sounds good but it has become a snare to the minister for if they decide to leave their group more light oh for the love of God their pensions are lost to them most can't stand this and they stay with their pressure groups I have been in the mission field and I have seen many preachers you know you bring this message to them they see it clearly but they tell you if I leave I'll be poor if I leave I'll leave my salary if I leave I will leave my pension if I my welfare who will B me the church WIll B me and you know these things if I leave so I am sorry continue preaching this the first man in Ethiopia I met you know he even cried I'm sure my wife remembers him you know he cried after hearing this message he hugged me tight and and he said this message is the truth continue preaching it God is with you but for me oh for me I'm sorry I can't believe it if I believe it there many people will be disappointed and also how will I leave preaching it so is saying because of money many ministers will leave the word and stand with their pressure groups now don't forget that this is the last age we know that this is the last age because Israel has gone back to Palestine if we believe that he really is coming then there must be something wrong with those who are building so vastly praise the name of the Lord where some Believers read qutes like these in the early years and they started and decided not to build churches but you see we believe it but we also believe in building but we don't believe in putting all our program to building we believe we should also look after lost souls by the way that's the real program the true program of the true church you know sometimes we lose vision our vision is not building a big Cathedral our vision is reaching out to the very last Soul if God gives us the man to buy land praise the Lord if he doesn't praise the Lord but through the whole time we must never lose the vision the vision is to find the last one amen that's why we drive you know 10 10 hours go preach you know in these Villages that's why we are you know starting out in this place that place you know actually when I was in you know some place in nebbe Cross as a young man who is doing a great work there and I saw I went there he showed me I was touched you know these are the things we should support you know why because it is bringing in Soul we are into the business of Soul we should never lose the vision we should never lose the vision but whatever else we can do we can do we will do but that's the business we are called it makes one thing that these people plan on staying here forever oh that the coming of Jesus is hundreds years of do you know that Religion Today is known as a big business you know whenever we have tried to find Brokers to fin us property you know they take you to a place and they begin showing you you see now there are people here here you can make good money this is what is in their mind because this is what the denominations have done they think that church is a business and indeed it is a business to them that's why you find even these younger people old ones on the streets preaching you think they are there because of the burden for L Souls many of but let me tell you many of them are there for money they preach and then they collect money offering there's one out down downtown he was collecting I don't know where they still there millions he has this oil he puts you're going to get a blessing 5,000 10,000 puts oil on you puts o on a blessing blessing blessing for money he's making money and you find young people on the streets they preaching because they want offering they want money they want money and you know that's why in the message our drive is not money come on now now our drive in this message is not money without price without money we are declaring this message amen amen you know that's why you young people you should not just always stay here don't look for a chance to preach here go out in the streets and byways go if you have a fire in you go and preach wi Souls be on fire for God do something for the Lord even you sisters go and witness invite a friend but you see church today has become a big business it is an absolute fact that they are placing business managers in the churches to take care of finances is this what God desires did not his word teach us in the book of Acts that seven Men full of the Holy Ghost and Faith serve the Lord in business matters you can surely see why God said you say you are wealthy I never said so you say but I never said so so listen he says there are radio programs television programs numerous Church endeavors that are costing millions and millions of dollars well of course some when they read this quote they also did not read between the lines many of them said we will not do radio program we not do television program because we don't want to spend millions of doar but you see the prophet was showing us the spirit of the age you see wealth and Powers into the church the membership increases along with the money yet the work is not being done as it was done when there was no money men at that time would work there were no cars but the gopel went all over the there were no aanes but missionaries I don't know how they travel but they went all over the world how did they do it listen it was the burden of the word of the Lord but you see we now have more money we have airanes we have cars we have motorbikes we you know we have even how do they call you know those you know uh how do they call them yes Rockets or whatever it is but the gospel is moving slower now than it was moving there on the day of Pentecost they never had microphones think about it they preached on one day to 3,000 3,000 people without microphone we have microphones today but can you imagine there is no one younger man that can even think of taking a microphone or rather a speaker going on the road and preaching to one why is the pressure for money the question the big question will be how do I benefit they would rather sleep in the bed and become so lazy but they don't have the burden for the the burden for L Souls let me tell you our generation is the worst and the pressure for this age you know people will become so traumatized because they don't have money they will not think of anything better because they don't have money it is not with money that you become great it is with a burden you have in your soul Hallelujah there was once two men they looked at the man at the place called Beautiful silver and gold Sur now but what I have I give unto you right in the name of Jesus rise up and walk does the church still have that that is what the church must have you that's what you should have if you don't have that then you have bowed to the pressures of the we must not rest we must not settle until we have what the apostles yes that manifestation that power of God are you following me that can make you eat when you have no money is the same power that made Elijah it he had no money do you know that Jesus said if you go out don't go with any P don't even go with a second clothing why because it's the Jehovah G provides whatever you need listen the church has to come to a place where we become Believers if you know what I mean we are not Believers we don't believe in the power of God but listen we must come to a place where we stop feeling sorry for ourselves because we don't have money like someone else are you hearing me the people who have accomplished a lot in this world for God and not the richest think about that they are not the richest in fact they're the poorest William Bram was a very poor man did you know did you know he didn't have money he even rejected $1.5 million he didn't have money he didn't have money he was [Music] broke and you you can't do anything for God because you feel you are brok let let me tell you our economy the economy of this world is different from the economy of God when God wants to do something nothing can stop him not the lack of money or the availability of it if we the Believers understand that we shall learn to walk by you take your Bible and study it you find all the great men and women of that God me to do big things they were poor as per the world standards all the disciples were poor men why didn't he make zakus one of the disciples zakus oh Zak okay you know he was a tax collector he had a lot of money he had cheated from these kind of friends people he had a lot of money he never made him one of the disciples but he chose Peter a fisherman a poor man and you you are saying you cannot do anything for God because you're poor you cannot dress properly and come to church because you don't have money to buy list we have another economy the work of God is reliant on God's economy we are besting on God his economy my brother not on the economy of this world that's why for you to give to the work of God it is an opportunity for you a great opportunity because you know what if you don't give God will continue with his work if I don't give God will continue with his work if I don't serve God will continue with his work if I Don't Preach God will continue saving Souls how God has a great big economy God has men and women that you don't even know of for you to serve him it is an opportunity you are not helping God God is helping youu you are the masses of him and you find Elijah he was there crying oh God I'm the only one remaining they have killed all of them God said look at this one now look at this don't you know I have more 7,000 that have not even bow a knee to Bow like what what 7000 not 1 2 3 four thousand whatever I am doing I'm not doing it for money I am working and serving at the mercies of God and I know it's an opportunity God has given me hallelujah amen it's an opportunity for me to serve him Hallelujah if I behave bad God has 7,000 God have Mery upon me God you whatever you are doing in whatever area in the house of God brother Marin for you to sit there for you to sit there and just run this thing here as simple as it looks God has 7,000 ready to replace that applies to each of you God has 7,000 ready to replace you you just misbehave okay go on the side what then manner of men should we be and women when we are serving and ministering we should stay consecrated we should you know be desirous of God to you know move in our lives and use us as servants and you see here he says wealth Powers into the church membership increases along with the money yet the work is not being done as it was done when there was no money but men rested solely on their ability given them by the Holy Ghost may God help us to rest on the ability given to us by the Holy Ghost they are paid now here is what he says about this generation there are paid Preachers did you know in most of the churches today preachers are on a salary so they are not preaching because they are called imagine what would you do if someone gives you a job and pays you for it you will do your best to please who your boss and in this case who is your boss the one who pays you so who pays you the church the people right so then you have to please those people not make them sad but you see if you preach what the word says without changing it you are going to make the people sad sometimes you remember I told you story of a pastor who you know had of a brother talking about women preachers and also about you know dressing scany cloths and you know he came and T it in his church and when he told it some two sister three the great financiers of the church the ones who give big seeds they they said ah he's attacking they picked their books and off they left and he saw them leaving he said Brethren please come back in the church I was just joking and they had to come back and the brother changed so today let's go in the real thing and he left the word oh you think it is comedy but wait until you sit in one of those churches and how these people compromise because these people are their [Music] bosses they are paid preachers they paid assistant paid Ministers of music you know you find you know all these people by the way you musicians out there in the world they pay everyone the the drama Rees a monthly or weekly you know organist they have a full band but each person is paid think about that each person and you know what these young men do they cannot play in the same church why because they have to find the church which pays better so if if dvf gives them one 100,000 he will assess look at evening light how much you uh 1 million you will not even see them again they'll be playing the other side you think I'm joking you don't know that these things happening in the in the denominations out there why I love this message of the hour hallelujah amen and the True Believers of this message if God has given you a gift you will not bow to the pressures of with without money you freely given you freely gave we preach to please the Lord you PR to please the Lord this is life of service not profit making but you see the one you are serving is faithful to reward every one of your lab Hallelujah paid custodians programs and entertainment all costing great psms but for all that the power is decreasing yes the church is Rich but the power is not there God moves by his Spirit not by the amount of money or talent in the church we don't want your talent we want the spirit of God working through you praise the name of the Lord that is how amen true servants inia will be you want to be sure spirit of God is using you have waited upon God for your service for the work you're doing for the Lord whether it is in a music department interpretation preaching you know even even being late in the church don't just come let the spirit of God use you you know you cannot receive the word when you are in the flesh enter the spirit and you know you begin to receive it you will begin to amend the word amen amen receive Lord now I want to show you how diabolical this agge for money has become the churches have gone all out to get membership especially of the wealthy these things are really very good principles if we understand it it will differentiate it will help you to understand why we are different from denomination you know they try to get the membership of people especially the wealthy ones everywhere there is cry to make religion so [Music] attractive I've even seen some time back on on YouTube so this Minister who changed literally everything brought something like a bouncing castle in the you know he has this screen you know he puts it there it changes colors very attractive and the colors that are changing are all reflected in what he has dressed and you know you know when you see him walk the way he has cut his hair this kind of style and you know the shoes the whole place looks so attractive and you know um then he was demonstrating whatever he was so he went on this the way he was delivering his suon on this is it called bouncing Castle so he was you know having a microphone of course on him somewhere and so he bounces as talking to the people Mak some acrobatics for and all imagine now someone come to church church is it's not like those places where you go and you are convicted and condemned you see it's all about what it's about getting membership so the money can flow it's all about money everywhere there is a cry to make religion so attractive Catholic pra and you say speak wait am I in religion in by the time I was in we do soft things you know little little slowly but today inating this cathal one of the cathal and they the songs we sing and they Dan I was like what so now you tell a young man he tell you why do I leave I'm I'm enjoying here uh plus I'm not being condemned I'm not being condemned so religion has become so attractive and appealing appe appealing that the rich and cultured and all who have worldly prestige will come in and be active in the [Music] church can't they understand that if wealth is the Criterion of spirituality then the world already has God and the church has nothing because the church is poor the true church has is been poor I don't care how any message Church in the world is to the standards in their country their church is poor the Catholic church in every country is the richest biggest numbers so how come they are that way yet we are the ones with the truth because we don't measure spirituality by how much money we have GED for ourselves now in thean church age brother says now this is nothing against rich people because God can serve a rich man some of God's children are rich but money can be such a snare not only those who have it but also to those who don't have it way back there in the first age James cried out to those who were putting stock in the wealthy people have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with respect to persons have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus with respect to persons have not the faith of of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of pass you know what happened in our church as we were growing up the rich ones the politicians they had special seats the the rich ones they had special seats and the others like that and the poorest they I'll be the other side that's how most of the churches do even in the Pentecostal churches because to them money is everything you see don't have the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons the poor there were trying to but up the rich in order to get help they were buttering them up so that they can get help don't do it Jim says don't do it money isn't everything money isn't the answer tell your neighbor money isn't the answer and today it is not the answer either we more wealth than we ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually it is not with money that God works he moves by his spirit and amen that that moving of the spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the word it is not with money that God works I want to repeat that it is not with money that God works how many want God to work for them it is not with money that God works God moves by his Spirit money is not the answer money isn't everything God Is The Answer God is everything a supernatural experience can give you everything you have ever dream we have more money and yet we have accomplished less you see we we say we are going to do this youth convention and other things some people think if they don't give us their money we will not do it let me tell you if something is the will of God it can never fail no man can fail church is not running because of money we need the money but God gives money anyhow so it is God who runs the church not money please understand what I'm saying in the church when Jesus was the pastor on Earth he even called them from their jobs they were no longer working and then it didn't mean because they're not working they should not pay tax so when the government need a tax wait a moment how are they feeding how are they sleeping we are talking about the economy of God Amen but you see when it came to the time of the government you see they needed money God just told Peter want what money just go to the to the lake fish the first fish open it mouth take out what you'll find inside and give it to the tax what am I trying to share to say to you to share what I'm saying is it is not with money the church is run I'm talking about the Church of Jesus Christ I'm talking about the gospel I'm talking about the word you know whether we go on radio or we go out somewhere or we help this church you know it is by God the church runs whether we want to buy the church and f a sanctuary if it is the will of God if it is the plan of God God will do it somehow because Jehovah Gyra he provides for every need we can't understand that if we are not in the spirit but some people think money is everything my sister money is not everything if God wants you to get married he will provide you the money if God wants you to have a wedding he will give you the money it is God not the money that's why you should go to God whenever you have need don't go to begging go to God because he's the provider for hallelujah hallelujah how much do we pay here 800,000 we can't afford it we can't afford it that's why people who didn't understand that they thought they have to serve God in a place which looks so bad because we can't afford he looks around the people how many will he give me 00,000 we can't afford it even me how much do I have oh we can't afford it ah let's go somewhere under a tree listen friends it is not whether we can afford it or not it is God who places it in our [Applause] pockets fish was fish fish didn't [Music] money but somehow God plac money there amen God told Peter I will make you fish as of men amen we are fish we are been fished out of the world and when God wants to do something he will place the money in our pocket it is not the money it is the god who does it and he's still in that business he provides Jehovah G don't look at your father your mother your pastor look at God that's why if you serve him Faithfully he will always provide don't compromise your stand because you have no money whether you have money or not he provides if he wants you to do something sometimes we have desires and sometimes he doesn't provide for something well because it's not his time it's not his will but if you sure it is God's will what you're doing God provides hallelujah hallelujah he moves by his Spirit no by money church is not run by money but is run by the spirit a preacher is not fueled by money you see in the Pentecostal reals when you invite a minister he asks you how much will you pay me or he says me without $10,000 here I can't come and have to look for it first when you put it on the table they Fu hallelujah hallelujah the anointing is money you see but let me tell you the Bride of Jesus Christ is not fueled by money we are fueled by the spirit Hallelujah and he puts money in our pockets to serve his purpose but you see the the the one of the pressures of this age is money money people want to be rich and they want to find money in one minute you know and and they they very because of that they very lazy you see you look at a man who is a millionaire and you you begin conting them I want to be like that but you're not willing to do what he did I mean the man has told you we had brother cosas here for instance he told us how he suffered how he worked for his uncle for years and he was paid only no at the end of the whole working he was paid he was dismissed and graciously and he was paid and that's all he had after laboring after sweating after working but you see that did not stop him and today he's a multi-billionaire now when people when young people of this generation hear that I want to be like but when it comes to work even little things they can't do you can't even Ser your mother only tell go wash tensil you can't serve her you can't serve your father go SL the compound and you sneak out you go begin playing football with your friends and then you come back is in in your bed l a generation you see but you you want a big thing let me prophesy to you if you continue on that rout you can never get what you want that's the truth you see riches don't come to poor riches don't come to Les people riches come to hard working people find something to do don't be La especially you young people now you are in your holidays stop sleeping 10 12 15 hours okay to those of you who don't want to sleep you sneak out you go in in in football you go out in these other things waste your time you see that's Les and you know the reward of Les is poverty whether you have education or not find something to do become busy are you hearing what I'm saying the Bible actually says a man who cannot provide for his family he is worse than unin in other words he can't make it to the Rapture so what does it mean it is impossible for a man who is working for God to fail to provide for you it's not your job which you provide it is God who provide through the works of your hand because he said I will bless the work of your hands what are you doing with your hands you're waiting for a miracle some people they even go to church Monday Mir oh Thursday Friday Sunday for sure it is coming today it will never come after you have prayed go and find a job work tell your neighbor go and work see that's how God provides he provides through work but don't become lazy the pressure of this age is for people to get money get it fast that's why they are going you know in all these loty programs you know because they want money and they want it fast they will some will do do anything money anything for money they will put the Bible aside we shall come back later for now what can I do to get money no Brethren whatever you are doing First Take it through the lenses of [Music] the if it is not taken through that you will surely fail money is not the answer God Is The Answer praise the name of the Lord and people want to live so I'll finish with this here in the man a man running from the presence of the Lord he says and Jonah here was called on and this one of the Minor Prophets of the Bible to go down to this city and here we find an example of all of us every one of us we always running from something we run from trouble we run from responsibilities and I go down he say sometimes we find ourselves PR to run from work we don't want to we don't want to work some people just thinks they can make their living without working is this our Prophet who saying now you're not saying amen you better shout a big amen is the truth but I think Solomon it was that said we could find here the answer in watching an aunt that's a very deep word I don't even think people understand it you know a little Aunt they tell me if that Aunt doesn't work every Aunt every Aunt must work you know how many they are and you know how many big ants they can be but they can't build it without others working each ant has to work together with another and then they build a big so brother says here they tell me if every ant doesn't work and just lay in that Aunt doesn't eat that [Music] winter so everybody has to work we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody has to face a certain responsibility but our people in this generation the younger people you know what is happening they want soft living without work they want to drive but they don't want to work they want to live in a in a very beautiful apartment they don't want to work you find someone on their phone having a beautiful big house mansion tell this is my dream you tell them what are I doing now to get it I'm praying you're wasting your time you are not looking like someone who is working towards your dream work we got so many things we have to do so much everybody has got a certain responsibility okay our Prophet here says when you choose your wife to get married or to choose when you choose your husband you've got to take a responsibility and then you must remember maybe you've build a home it's a nice pretty home and then remember as a married woman you have got to think of the responsibility of raising children and you got to think of them pretty sequels going to have little dirty handprints all over them then you get you got the responsibility of educating your children you got a responsibility of clothing and feeding are you hearing so when you think about getting married you're not thinking about just enjoying time with your husband or your wife you must think of the responsibility have you matured enough to enter into that responsibility you think it is a Bed of Roses you see when you get married you think of of children you you you think of walls being DED and you have to clean and that's why people don't think of that responsibility when they go for marriage a child does some little things and he will hit him with a big slap until the ears will bur because this man was not prepared you didn't see this coming you must know that this is responsibility marriage is responsibility as a mother you must teach your children you must educate them it is responsibility as a father you must close them Fe it is responsibility everything is a responsibility and it is so easy when the responsibilities face us it is so easy to shock from them and we find out that marriage is a responsibility in all manners and that's why many young people this this time are running away from Marriage they fear responsibility oh God have Mery on our generation it has no backup on every many times this had this is how to say he says but it is true that ministers many times they Shar a responsibility for standing for the true word of God when they are confronted with it they will shock that responsibility when truth of the word of God is brought face to face with the human beings we are PR to shock back until the last resource I just got through talking to my little nephew up there he's a Catholic and I baptized that boy in the name of Jesus Christ here a few years ago and he got with some little girl and turned Catholic and I H his mother's hand while she was dying over there she said to me the last words take care of Melvin and he's just being Dreaming Dreams he he he and he talks about the one of the dreams of Melvin he says he's been Dreaming Dreams he said I would walk into your church Uncle Bill in his dream and he was standing there preaching and I would run up to start to make a confession and then I would wake up he said I have I have been wrong I said Melvin you don't need no interpretation for that your place is down there where you belong but to face up to the responsibility sometimes it takes the very hide off of us to do that as a father to face up the responsibility to give your child a weeping did you know even to beat your child a responsibility children to be beaten to be whipped by your father did you think did you actually know it is his responsibility oh your amens are now very dry yes them little fellows you don't want to do that but as a father oh as a mother you have got to F the responsibility of raising that child because the Bible said spare the road and you will spare your son and that still stands good in the sight of every psychologist there in the world that Still Remains God's truth if there had been more of that of that practiced we wouldn't have had so much juvenile delinquency and and the RO we got in the world today but the old Golden Rule are you hearing me now the old Golden Rule of the home has been broken long Ag and they let the kids do whatever they want every parent has a responsibility you cannot let your children do what they whatever they are if they feel they want to do whatever they are let them get out of the house let them be on their own yes but as long as you are under your father mother's roof it is the responsibility of your father and mother to guide you right but even as I said ministers come to face to face with the truth and then they walk away from it there seems like there's something that they don't want to face up [Music] to they just want soft living let the children do what they did you actually know young people whose parents left them to do whatever they want they even boast about it and they say their parents are good they're not good they're not good a good parent will not let you do whatever you want and even God cannot let you do whatever you want because he's a good parent he will not let you have soft living even when he wants to give you something he will let you earn it he will not make you get it he will let you ear it that's how a good parent does you remember the story thatas M have talked about byas in this service so much he gave us a story here of a boy who was you know um having Rich parents and his father I don't remember the whole story proper but his father told him if you make so much and you bring it to then I think I'll do something for you I don't remember the whole story some of you might but then this boy you know went and um was GI took the first money and gave it to his father his father threw it in the fireplace and the man B and the boy was just there told him dad so what should I go go bring more money and make more money and and then you bring it so you went and brought the second and the it in the and said now that what what do you want me to do says go again now the whole time this boy was being given this money by his mom I think but on this one he said what is wrong with my dad let me go out and make my own money I think this playing a trick some so went and and and and made the money it took him a little longer but he swe it out and he brought it to his dad Dad here is the money this time here is the money and he knew what this money me he had sacrificed he for and his father took the money and he was going to throw it in the fire just like the first two times and a boy ran into the fire said you cannot throw myy like the fire I SED for this for this ah it's all right that's why the father was waiting for and you know why we always don't value what we have because you have not labored for them even God don't expect I'm trying to bring a principle to you here don't expect God to bring money from Heaven into your pocket you need to work but you see what God will do he will train you he will guide you you will ask him yes he will give you whatever you have asked but through your work through your labor and what he does when he brings it to you and you you will cherish it because you have labored for you have labored you not you will not even look for soft living imagine if if if you've gone there to sweep on on the on the road and you made 1,000 let me ask you a question do you think you'll buy a bottle of 1,000 water water you cannot do you can you've sweated for my 1000 you'll be thinking what can I do in this to multiply it but you see why people love so is because they get they get free passes your father gives you 100,000 and then you squand it SP it in one day two days that's what they do at school 100,000 after two weeks it is over now I'm suffering it's finished where did it go they don't know the value of they want stop leaving they can't go like for portion because they don't know what it takes to make thisy and want the soft food you know with his father's money and that's why Believers we don't support the work of God because we don't want to work and probably the money you are receiving you're not getting it properly you're not getting it in the right way but if you're getting your money the right way serving God with your money will be a priority you will choose serving God than having soft life you will not B to the pressures of and because people don't because people keep bowing to they always have they always have n nervous tensions anxiety pain heartbreak these are the things that are attacking Our Generation it's the pressures of our age let us stand our feet but friends I hope this will not just be a sermon these are things that are applicable in your life if you can take it and apply it in your life you will never be the same the musicians can please come let's pray our loving Jesus we know that you have called us for a greater purpose for a greater cause we have a work to do Lord it makes me my heartbreak when I see a lot of work that is supposed to be done for your kingdom and with very few being burdened for standing for you help our generation Lord those who are young and those who are older because this is our time this is our time to stand for you we cannot risk it with soft living we cannot risk it with only the love for money we cannot risk it for anything we want to serve you Faithfully one day we want to walk in and want you to hear you say Well done my good walk ye into the joys of father Lord may you help us each of us father and for many Lord who desire in their heart that they will find something to do help them Lord and provide because of Jehovah some of them need wisdom others need direction
