Yes Lord Jesus. You die on the glory. You die. You [Music] died. Thank you Jesus. [Music] Roat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Amen. Let us speak to him. Lord Jesus, we are here to worship you this morning because we know that you care about us. Many times, Lord, in our weakness, many times we pretend and hide our feelings from you. But Lord, I know that you care. And I know you are concerned about each and every one of us. And I know that you desire that we might worship you in spirit and in [Music] truth. And this morning, as we have come and gathered around your word this morning, [Music] We have come empty. Fill us. We have come with a hunger and a thirst. Feed us Lord and quench us. Quench our thirst that we have come with within our [Music] soul. I ask that Lord you will come and touch each of our hearts before we leave this place. [Music] And Lord, by the time we leave, May we indeed each of us witness the presence of the Holy Spirit. Grant it Lord. [Music] We are [Music] standing on holy ground. He said where two or three are, he's there. And I know that there are angels all around. Let us pray. [Music] Jesus. Now we are standing in his presence. Oh, now with every eye closed, if the musicians can pull it down a little bit, I'd like us to sing that song again. And I want you to believe and I want also myself to believe that we are in his presence. Now he is able to inspire us. He's able to uh put words on our lips that will just be exactly what you need. Now listening to the tapes of a prophet many times at the end of the service there would be a moment like this and then he would speak to the people for just a little bit and encourage them and tell them he's able to come and if he comes he will be able to call you out and he'll be able to speak about your need and he will tell them only believe he's able to come. And he would say, "I don't know if he will come or if he will not, but I know he promised he [Music] would." And when the people believed in just a moment, he would say, "He's now here, the Holy Spirit." So friends, I am not the prophet. I'm just a preacher. But he also in the same way he uses a prophet. He uses a preacher. The prophet will call you out by name and tell you about your issues. But through the preacher, he will speak about your issue directly addressed to you. So if we will only believe, he's able to come and speak to you. Let us sing that with all our hearts and our hearts lifted up to him. Let us approach him the right way to surely come and address our ears. We are [Music] standing. Hallelujah. [Music] on holy [Applause] [Music] ground. And I I know there are angels all around. [Music] Great praise. Hallelujah Jesus. Oh yes, Lord. We are singing his praises for the holy ground. Every hand lifted up. Let us sing it one more time. We are standing. We are standing. on the [Applause] morning. Oh, I know there are angels all around here this morning. I know there are angels all around. Come on, let us praise him now. Holy praise. Hallelujah. Jesus. is praising God. With your hands lifted up, praise him. Let us do it now. Let us praise him. Let us worship him and tell him, Lord, we are here for you. Oh Lord, may you come and minister to us. We are here for you this morning. Come and use the preacher this morning to minister to our needs. We are here Lord because of you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. [Music] We are [Music] here. Father, we are here. Father, we are here. [Music] We are here for you. Spirit, we are here. Can I have someone thirsting? Someone hungry this morning for his presence? We are here. Someone speaking to the [Music] Lord when you dieus. [Music] Yes, we are here. Truly one Jesus. We are here. Oh Jesus. We are praying. We are crying. We are seeking. We are desiring. Lord, we are hungry for you. Lord, we need you. Lord Jesus. I need you myself, Lord. Jesus. We are here this morning. We are crying this morning. We are here. Tell him Jesus. Even if you don't feel like telling him, just tell him anyhow. Tell him I am here alone for you this morning. Speak to me. I desire you for you. Come on now. Everybody should do that to him now. Tell him now one more time. [Music] Jesus, I believe the Holy Spirit will be pleased to see us hungering for [Music] you. [Music] Heat. Heat. Amen. Amen. Amen. Shall we turn our Bibles to the book of Psalms chapter 34? Psalm 34. We are reading from verses [Music] 14. You need to decrease this microphone. It is having an echo. 3414. [Music] If you are there, say amen. I'm happy to see those who have sailed through the [Music] rain. God bless you. There are others who failed. You need to need to break through. We need to make our calling and election sure. We have to come to the throne with boldness. The kingdom of God is taken by force. So God bless you for being able to come. God has something for us. He cannot bring us here for nothing. There is a reason why he has brought us. Is that a man? We are reading from verses 14. Um I'm reading from verses chapter 34. Depart from evil and do good. Seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. The face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. The righteous The righteous cry. Everybody read that. The righteous cry. When was the last time you cried? When was the last time you, you know, became messed up in his presence? You see, brothers, don't frustrate my interpreter because I don't want him to switch off. The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and deliverth them out of all their troubles. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliverth him out of them all. Number two, [Music] [Music] Amen. You may be seated. There are times when um a preacher comes when he feels the fire and is ready to spit it out. And there are times when he feels convicted about speaking a few things and sometimes you don't even know whether you're going to speak fire. And so those are one of the days. I just have a few things I feel to relate to you. And um so I don't know how it will come. But um I'm convinced that it is the will of God for us to hear. Um it's not so much of a do doctrine but it it is just basic Christianity. I I was dealing with the subject of um the Elijah speaking about um um the the the C the message staying the C. If you've not listened to those meetings, I would recommend that you go back and listen. um because there a few things that God was trying to impress upon us and I think it would be befitting for a church member when you miss a service you go back and listen to it. Yeah, you do. There was a service you didn't where you're not able to come to church. It is noble for you to either stream or when you get time put it on and listen. Not jumping jumping listen to the whole service. [Music] It is good for you to listen to I mean on YouTube these days there there's like every church is streaming and we all from time to time will go listen to that service listen to that church listen to that church but I tell you and this I I tell you with with all my heart it is very important for you to follow what is preached in your church because that is for you. We tailor made for you only you. Um so we we we stream but really we are streaming for our members from every now and then people call from you know text and call from different countries. Oh I was blessed by the ministry and we appreciate that. But uh first of all here in the church we started streaming because when we left Ethiopia there was another place in Aasa where there was no church and those believers were about 30 or so they were streaming directly from us here on Zoom. Actually we're doing a kind of Zoom connection. If you go back in those old old services, you you realize that they would also give some special songs and you know and so they were like we were interconnected and this started way before even Zoom before the church in Addis was established. I remember when we would go preach for a while two months and then leave the believers would be all on their own. So we would call um I remember how were we calling let's try to remember it wasn't we using WhatsApp it was something else I don't remember either direct call or something like that and then we put in a conference they would put the phone there on the table and I would begin preaching a Sunday morning service and um well of course the church got established in Adis Ababa So by the time we left Ethiopia, there was need in another area called Hawasa where Pastor Ephraim comes from and so there at that time they were streaming directly by the team. He was a deacon um but he was originally from Kenya. The believers would gather in his home And then they would do um those of you who were with us in the other small place and also at home, you remember we used to have uh those zoom meetings with them and sometimes they would also sing their special songs and and we would see it and um then we would also minister to them. technology is good if you're using it for the right purpose and motive. And so uh being that uh many uh brethren in Ethiopia look at us as um their father. When we stopped doing the Zoom meetings, I thought it is important also to continue streaming. That way um even after there are no more local service they can always stream and and get blessed. But also for the believers here those who are not able to attend services sometimes they can be able to stream or watch it afterwards. Sometimes you even in a service and you feel like I need to listen to that again. That's the purpose why we stream. We do not do this because everybody's doing it. It had an origin which I've just given you and it has a purpose and a motive. It is for you. So if a if a service is preached and you don't know about it, you are not growing with others, you will get stunted and it's not good. Always go back and listen. I was appreciating brother polyap. I heard him mention he preached for us also on our brother shalom asked him to preach in um the home sale. So he was mentioning he said that you know he missed many services when he was at school. So when he came back he decided to put all of them. So since he has been listening to one by one in the order that it was preached. I think that is quite noble. I I feel that now streaming is for for something. He was telling me ah I'm I'm I'm being my wife was saying he's changing and and I I was also saying he was telling me I'm really being blessed. He's doing a good work in me. I I can assure you if you listen to every service that is preached at church you cannot remain the same. You cannot remain the same. Amen. So I was that subject is a good subject which you need to go back and listen to because there was some little teaching then putting a few things into perspective of what exactly we believe. But this morning I want to take another turn and speak on the subject vulner vulnerable in his presence. Vulnerable in his presence. Now vulnerability means being open about your feelings. Being open about your fears. Being open about your weaknesses. Being weak. Feble. Accepting to be weak. Accepting to be feeble. Frail without hiding it. You see in Lugan I think the word would be you know um have you ever seen someone who has done something wrong and they're being rebuked by an elder but they are you know dry eyed and um you know they're not bothered. They just shrug everything off and then when they tell him apologize they say okay I'm sorry if I've done something wrong I'm sorry. You see many people are like that especially our generation is like that. They do not break down. They do not accept to show weakness. They say if you show we your weakness. It means you are going to be underlooked you are going to be despised. You are going to be seen as if you were cano. So they always want to I'm so happy to see sister Baka. God bless you. Nice to see you. And you know they say that you know uh they don't want to show their weakness because according to them or according to some of you who are listening to me, when you show your weakness, you will be taken for granted. You will be despised. You'll be looked down on. So, we have a very strong generation that is actually very weak. We have a very very strong generation that is so fearful They have a lot of emotional weak feelings but they can never show it. You see even that's why when you come to church you you the word sometimes is preached and maybe you are hammered seriously and you know that God is speaking to you but you convince yourself not to break it down. You convince yourself that you are fine. You don't even look down. You look at the preacher as if to say that uh he's preaching to someone else. You even don't say amen because you feel if you say amen, someone may realize they preaching about you. You see, so you you you behave as if that you are fine. It's a hypocritical age. People don't want to break you. You see sometimes when the word is preached and you know you look at a neighbor and say so that they may not think it is actually you that was being spoken about. So people do not want to break down yet they are broken. You know they are weak. They they are feeble frail but they hiding it. They are actually professionals at hiding it. They're guilty but they will hear the word and they will be like a rock. They will not accept the word to penetrate. they will always protect themselves because they think if they break down they will be embarrassed. So today we are speaking about being vulnerable in his presence. Anyone who is not vulnerable can never be received by God. Today I want to show you by the word that God can only accept you if you accept to be vulnerable. And if you refuse, if you are his child, he will allow situations to come. He will allow things to happen to you that will break you. So I have an advice for you. Don't let God force you to be vulnerable. Unless, of course, if you are not his child. But if you're his child, he will force you. He will he will make you. He will he will put you in a corner until you become vulnerable. Until you accept your weak, until you cry, cry. Then now God will accept But you see, you don't have to go it that way. You can you can hear the word and you become vulnerable. How? By letting the word penetrate into your heart by accepting the word to do the job it has been sent to [Music] do. You know, I've often heard that preachers that cry on the pullpit are despised. And so many times when preachers come to preach, you know, they they they try not to cry. They try not to be vulnerable. We always try to do that. I can assure you. I personally I always try not to be vulnerable on the pullpit because I look so stupid. Imagine a person on the pit crying and weeping. You look so foolish and stupid and as if you don't know what you're doing. You look childish. But many times sometimes you hold it and you realize you cannot. Why? Because you know you have allowed the hol the presence of the Holy Spirit to penetrate through your heart. I remember there was a time uh brother Shalom I think was a song leading and and you know he started crying and and after the service I I told him a man you should you you should try and and and you know and stand [Music] and yes I was advising him not to be vulnerable. But this morning, I'm advising him different. It is important for you to define, whether you are a song leader or a preacher, whether you are old or young, whether you are big or small, whether you are educated or not educated, it is a must to be vulnerable. in his presence. If you do not accept if you are God's child, he will make you today please be connected because I'm I'm giving you a principle which is going to be um which is going to be a big breakthrough to some of you. Now here in the book of Psalms, this is King David speaking it. And King David had an experience invulnerability. And so we hearing from a man who is experienced. He says, "Depart from evil, do good, seek peace, pursue it. The eyes of the Lord must upon the righteous. And his ears is open unto their cry. His ears are not open to their strength. His ear is not open to their prayer. Their strong prayers. Oh God, may you do this. Oh God. Hallelujah. No. No. No. No. His ears are open to their cry. God wants to hear a cry of a baby. To others, you are a father. To others, you are big. To others, you educated. But to God, you are a baby. When you come in his presence, in any situation, anywhere you are, except to be vulnerable. If you are you are a mother or you are a father or you have ever been a raised a child, you will know that there is one thing that devastates a parent. Nothing like it. That's the cry of a baby. The cry of a baby. When a mother actually a mother can hear that the baby is devastated ways away. A mother will have certain things in her body which will make her get connected to her [Music] baby when the baby is hungry before even the baby begins. You know the mother will begin to feel things happening and then her heart will will beat for her baby. Something must be wrong with my child. A mother has a a 60 sense. She has something some connection some connection she has with a baby. A mother actually mothers have instincts. You know when something is happening with a child you know a mother will feel it from a distance even if you're in another country. One day I was in Tanzania and I I was I had gone for a missionary trip and I was still going through Salam and there I was almost killed but my mother back in Uganda Uganda you know she felt it she dreamt it and she became restless and she prayed for me before it even happened and I survived because of her prayer. What I'm saying a mother has instincts before something happen and then when you begin crying the mother will leave everything she's doing. Sometimes I see my wife. You know when a baby cry in a bad way. There are certain ways that a baby can cry that will move a mother and there are certain ways a baby can cry and a mother will be moved but will take longer to respond. But but you see there is a certain way a baby can cry. You know, I remember there was this cry that the little baby made and my wife was I don't know what she was having in her hand, but she dropped it and she what's happening? Why? There was even nothing big. But the way the baby cry, but a certain urgent response from the mother. The Bible calls God the blessed one. He's our mother and he responds to our cry. The cry that is made. When you become vulnerable, when you are weak, when you need help, when you are confused, when you cry out, our father, whenever you cry out, you respond and he likes responding to those that are weaker because those who are weaker are more desperate than others. They will cry out with a bigger shout, with a bigger cry and then mother God will come running into the earth. Hallelujah. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous. We talked about righteousness. It's not your righteousness. It is his righteousness upon you. Amen. Amen. So his ears are upon He he his ears are open unto their cry. Amen. When was the last time you cried? When was the last time you cried? That's the moment. Think about it. So, is it to mean that you are not vulnerable? Is it to mean you don't have problems? Is it to mean you don't need help? The reason why you've not been crying out, the reason why we come here and say everybody pray, you can't even cry out because you're pretending to be strong. You are hiding your vulnerability. The face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. But the righteous, the righteous, those who have become the righteousness of God. Are you here this morning? The righteous cry. Amen. And the Lord heareth. Oh my. And deliverth them. When you cry, the Lord hear. God will hear every cry. And when he hears your cry, he will not forsake you. He will not leave you alone. He will deliver you out of all your troubles. But the problem when we go into trouble, we do other things. We don't come to be vulnerable in his presence to cry out to him. You know you have to cry out to God in every situation. When you are a sinner, you realize something has has got a hold of you. We need to learn to cry out. When you don't have money, you don't have job. When you're confused, when your business is going down, when everything is, you know, disorganized, you feel you are the one who always has problems. You have to learn to cry out. Stop crying to your friends and brothers and sisters. The Bible says, "Cast be a man who trusts in another man." I can help you, but I can't help you with everything. Your friend can help you, but not with everything. We need to learn. Crying to the Lord, being vulnerable. in his presence. If you read the book of Psalms, you realize what I'm telling you. David is our good example of a vulnerable man in his church. No wonder what God said. We'll talk about it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now he continues on. The Lord is near. And to them that are of a broken heart. Meaning those who are vulnerable. Those who are broken broken. Those who have a heart that is weak and is broken and and has accepted to repent and has accepted to change and is willing to seek help from God. God is near unto God such that let us be of a contrite spirit. The righteous will have many afflictions. But the Lord deliverth him out of all of them, out of them all. Meaning, don't you worry, brother. Don't you worry, sister. All the afflictions that God has permitted to come to you, he has the solution. He has a solution. No man has a solution. But our God, he has a solution. But he wants you to cry out. He wants you to be vulnerable in his presence. And I'm going to begin now just reading the opening scripture. So I'll now begin with a quote from questions and answers. Uh brother Bam had a very good advice for me and he asked a question. Wouldn't you all like to have a real Bible church? Is that a man? Brother Solomon, did you hear what the prophet asked? He said, "Wouldn't you all like to have a a real Bible church, a real Bible church where all gifts, spiritual gifts, we are set in order, everything making manifest just exactly the way it should be. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful if we would have a real Bible church? Now, you are going to have to sacrifice. If we want that real Bible church, we are going to have to sacrifice. And he said, we are not going to have sacrifice money. Money will not make a real Bible church. It has its place. It is not what makes a real Bible church. What are you going to sacrifice? You are going to sacrifice some of you your own ideas, your own ideas. You are going to have to sacrifice them. And he says you are going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer. It's not easy. Why? Because of time. And you know it is so funny. We can have time for everything else. We usually do for 12 hours in a day and 12 hours in the night, but you fail to have 30 minutes sacrifice in prayer. The the people who sang songs they wrote and said, "Take it to the Lord in prayer. If you go back to that song, if I remember, we will sing it at the end. Very very good song. Do are you discouraged? Do you have are you come with a lot of care? Do you have issues? Do you have problems? Take it to the Lord in prayer. But it looks like the church has forgotten. We have come to a place where prayer is no longer on the menu. where fasting is no longer even talked about, where time with God is no longer converted. In every revival, there has been prayer. There cannot be a revival without prayer. Even when we talk about the East African revival, these were men and women of pray. the revival in the days of wisdom and all these other Pentecostal revival. Air was part of the ingredient meaning you know you cannot become vulnerable and not express it and you can only express it when you are crying when you are praying when you are shouting when you're falling when you're kneeling vulnerability is expressed You cannot hide it. But if you don't express it, it means you do not have it. But if you you are vulnerable, you know, you cannot kneel before somebody unless you respect them, unless you accept to submit to them. You see, you kneel before your husband because you respect him. You kneel before whoever your elders because you respect him. You see, but you cannot kneel before someone you do not submit to. here in Bugganda. If a woman does not kneel to you if you're a man, it means she doesn't respect you or she feels she's bigger than you or she feels you are younger than her. That's why women don't kneel before children. Is that right? They don't show vulnerability before them. But when you are expected, they kneel before you. How much more God Christians have forgotten to express their vulnerability before God? You know when you come before him, how many of you even kneel now? Now there is no there's no posture that you must be in in prayer. Prayer is prayer. You don't have to always be kneeling. I'm saying it's not a doctrine to kneel down in prayer. But just like uh you know it's not a doctrine to kneel down when you asking for someone's forgiveness. But if you really really feel it in your heart that sincerely I've hurt that person, I've broken that person. I need to really move them to forgive me. No one will even tell you kneel down. It will be automatic. You will find yourself kneeling down, touching their legs, crying, forgiving. Why? Because it mean you are sincere. even with God. You see, you can pray while standing, while you know sleeping, while kneeling, while moving. I tell you what, when it comes to vulnerability there, vulnerability has a posture. You will break. So he says, "You are going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer for us to have a real Bible church." Believers of our time never pray. Sister, do you pray? Brother, do you pray? Do we pray? If you don't pray, you cannot have a Bible church. You need time in prayer not as a church but as an individual because if if we don't pray as an individual we cannot even pray as a church song says let us worship God if five people drive others reading the Bible others looking around oh friends there is the problem in the camp. We need to go back to the foundations of our we need to be vulnerable in his presence whereby he can feel amen responsibility of answering our cry. Hallelujah. He says you are going to have to sacrifice your stubborn will. [Music] Many of us are stubborn. We are very stubborn. You know, you can't even, you know, lift up your hand is church. It will finish and I'll go home. And then when you go home, then what brethren? You see whereby you just come here and you are like a rock. The word is preached. I'm sorry. I I don't mean to ridicule you, but I really I'm trying to express. You see, whereby you do not respond. Where God speaks and you don't respond. Where the word goes and you don't respond. The worship, the worship is happening and you are just there looking around. You are not responding. You are hiding your vulnerability. Let me tell you, you are weak. You are broken. You have problems. You are sinful. But you are hiding it. And because you are hiding it, that's why it is impossible for you to overcome. That's why God is always move when he sees weakness. He knows he sees it even when you have not expressed it. But he always responds at the expression of it. You know many times in a prayer line A man would come and then brother begins to discern we have this and then with men he always had problems you know he can come and spend a little time discerning this man you go listen to why because men always want to show they are strong the prophet is speaking to They're just there. Is that true? Is that the truth? And then he would just speak a few things and tell him, "Go believing." But a woman would come before he even begin to talk she because of the presence. The man was he not in the presence? He was. But when he felt the presence, he shrugged it off. Many times we come here. The presence is there. The presence is tangible. You can feel it. You shrug it off. Some of you even move out in the time when the presence is here and you move out. You are not being vulnerable enough. You have amen to respond to your vulnerability and express it before God. And you see when this woman comes and then brother says don't you worry you are fine it won't kill you what you're feeling he's a presence and then woman is crying tears are rolling down after eyes and then he would begin talking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 about her life and why going almost going through her life because she has accepted vulnerability. She has opened up her heart and God is just going through it. And let me tell you, brethren, that's what we need to do. We need to be women cuz we are the bride of Christ. We need to be weak. The Bible says a woman is a weaker vessel. So we need to be like that. We need to be weak vessels in his presence. That's why he says unless somebody is like a child, he will never enter the kingdom. Meaning grace responds to vulnerability, grace, grace. When God sees vulnerability, weakness, expression of it, he responds immediately. But for us, we are stubborn. And he says, you are going to have to sacrifice a stubbornness. You're going to have to sacrifice a stubbornness. And he says, you have to break down in humility. Brother, if you have the quote, put it here that I'm reading the quote. Maybe you see you have to break down in humility. Amen. God is not looking for powerful people. God is not looking for sinless individuals. God does not use perfect people. But God uses weak people. All you the people who are ready to be vulnerable and accept their weak and accept their humble accept nothing. God loves you. That's why look at all the people God has used the ages. These are people who have a lot of problems. Call them flaws if you want. great servant of God has had big flaws flaws. I can go one by one but I have a few I want to show you today and if I don't finish maybe on Wednesday I can continue this is important for us to understand being weak in his presence. You have to break down. Tell your neighbor you have to break down. Accept to break down. When you break down, your friends may call you a fool. They may call you an audible. Sometimes I see people breaking down in church and I see others looking at as if to say, "What is wrong with you?" You don't know what is wrong with you. But I will tell you what is wrong with them. They are accepting to be vulnerable in his presence. Hallelujah. When someone is vulnerable like that, they cannot walk away the same. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. See the world Christian move is sacrificial. I see one one or two people dozing. I'll call you out and it will really be a shame. So you better work on yourself. I already see two or three. I'll help the deacons and I call them out and it will really really be a shame. So please I just wanted to do that so you can wake up and hear the word so you can accept also to to break it down. Sometimes deacons come they tell someone brother you are dozing. No no no no no pretending you know you are you you are dozing maybe because you were tired or whatever accept tell the deacon thank you someone here you don't accept to break down in humility you see Brother, you're doing no I'm not. May God help us. The whole Christian move is sacrificial. He that will follow me. Let him deny [Music] himself. Let him take up his cross and follow me daily. Is that right? How often do you have to sacrifice? Every day. Hallelujah. Paul said he died daily. Every day. May God help me to die for you. Amen. David was a man who is a great example that I want us to look at. God made Saul a king. When the Israelites said, "We want a king." He said, "All right, I'll give you a king." So God chose a man and his name was Saul. You know how God chose him? You know, he told him, "But when you go among the prophets, you will begin to prophesy like them." That will be a sign to you that you are chosen to be king. And when he went among the sons of the prophets, he began prophesying the whole day to the extent that even the people said, "Saul is prophesying. Is he one of the prophets? That was a sign that God had chosen him to be a prophet to be a king." So he became a king. God chose soul. I'm showing you, God can choose you to be something. But because you refuse to be vulnerable in his presence, he can take it away from you. Soul never went to hell. Saul was not serpent sick. God actually forgave Saul. You realize that at the end of his time when he woke up somehow when he woke you called the witch of endo and they brought up the spirit of s he he told him today tonight you be with me. You see but we know that prophet Samuel was not in hell. But of course we know that or were going to hell in paradise in that place where they were locked up. But when Jesus died and went to uh this same place paradise, he opened up those doors and he released all of them including King Saul. So Soul is a brother. Call him brother Saul. So, brother Saul was chosen by God to become a king. But you know, he was a proud man. He was a man that was having a strong heart. He never accepted correction. He never accepted to be humble. He knew who he was. He knew he was a king. He always beat up his children and he always saw himself above his brethren because of what God allowed him to have. Whatever you have in this life, God has allowed you to have it. The same God who has given it to you. He can take it away. But now he wants you to humble yourself and then you can enjoy the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Maybe has given you money. Maybe has given you a car. Maybe has given you a family. Maybe has given you lands. Maybe has given you a gift. Whatever he has given you to do, he's giving it to you. for two reasons. So that your joy may be full and also that you may serve him and serve his people. But if you don't use those things for that purpose and you become proud and you become stuffed, he will take it away from you. You will still go to heaven. But you'll be despised on earth. And even in heaven, you can't have some ranks. What will he say? Well done, my good and faithful servant. You were good, but you were not faithful because you were proud. May God help us to be humble. Praise the name of the Lord. May God help you to be humble that when I get over there, he'll give me his hand. Well done, my good and faithful servant. I want to be a good servant. All of you are servants. I want to be a good servant and I want to be good and I want to be faithful. in whatever he has given to me. It is for his glory for my glory and for his glory. So God made soul praise the name of the Lord and I want to implore deacons. You see I was affected a bit because of the people moving out. Please all of us are adults. Some of you, you know, are not very old. Most of you are young. You can sit through a 1 hour, 1 hour and a half. It is important for you to respect the presence of God. Stop moving up. Please help me with those people moving up. God bless you. So, we see here Saul God made him a king. God chose him. And Saul was anointed. Don't joke with Saul. He was anointed. He was a man of God. He was anointed with the spirit of God. But you know, Saul was proud. He was unrepentant. He was stiffarted. And you know, God left Saul. He removed the kingdom from me. I want you to look at verses 10 of chapter 15 Samuel. He says, "Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying, it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king, for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments." And it grieved Samuel, and he cried unto the Lord all night. [Music] Friends, I want you I want us to to to to to listen to this very attentively. God chose Saul. But Saul refused to do what God told him to. He became a proud man. And then God came down and he says, "I even regret. I regret I made soul king." Are you one of those that are making God regret for what he has made you? Oh God, may I never make you. I have set soul to be king. I repent. I regret that I set him up to be king. for he is turned back from following [Music] me and has not performed my commandments and it grieved the soul. When a child of God sees another child of God in sin, it cannot make you happy. It will make you sad. When Saul had that, it grieved him. And the Bible say soul cried unto the Lord the whole night. Not one hour, not two, three, four, the whole night. What is that? Vulnerability. to someone else who would have said, "Oh God, at least me have been faithful, use me, let us learn to cry for our brothers." Listen, brother, sister, let us learn to cry for them when they have failed God, when they have sinned, when they have strayed away. Let us learn to cry. You know he always puts a mark on those who cry and sigh for the abominations done in the city. He loves those ones who cry and sigh because of the sin in the country. We should even pray for Uganda. We should pray for our city. We should pray for our church. When you see someone going wrong, pray for them. Pray for the leader. Pray for the minister. Don't be happy because of sin. And then you begin moving it around. Oh, cry and sad because of the sins committed. And then he will seal you up. Oh, crying moves God. Being vulnerable in his presence. We see he has sold the whole night he cried unto the Lord. Who are you to say you cannot cry? Don't you have tears? Don't you have feelings? Why don't you cry before God? Why are you very dry? Why are you very dry? Are you saying you're very strong? That is just religion. You have to break down. Hallelujah. 1 Samuel 15 22. And Samuel said, "As the Lord, as the Lord has great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord, behold, to obey is better than sacrifice. and to hecken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is at the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord. The Lord has also rejected you from me. Amen. I want I don't want to be denied. Sister, I want to encourage you, brother. Do not let the Lord reject you. God can reject you and you still go to heaven. And you live in this world when you you are the one who always asks, "But God, why? But you still make it to heaven. Why does God reject you? Because of stubbornness, because of of having a hard heart. You know, you know the Bible says because of rebelling against his word. You think giving to God is better than obeying him. Obey his voice. And what is his voice? His voice is his word. And what I'm preaching to you tonight is he has said here the Lord is not having delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord. So rather humble yourself, break it down, except to be corrected. Some people can't even seek for help. That is pride. We are all weak. I am a weak thing. You are a weak thing. You are a weak. All of us are weak. We need help from the savior. Some of you go die with your problems because you don't want to be held. You don't want to look stupid or look foolish or look humble. You don't want to be despised. You are hiding your weakness. Accept [Applause] vulnerability. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Accept vulnerability. You know the other day my wife was rebuking me and she said dear but remember I'm your wife. I can correct you. Okay. It is not easy to accept weakness especially for men. They want always to show they are good and the better they on top of it. One time I told my wife, "Don't you worry even if I don't accept but in my heart I've accepted later. You will see me changing." But I'm preaching to myself tonight and I'm preaching to you men. Accept weakness. Say I am sorry. I need to change. I need a savior. Pray for me. [Applause] Hallelujah. We need to accept weakness. Amen. Because you see vulnerability has something that moves God. Hallelujah. Some people think they are higher than others. We are all low people. We are all mas without him we can do nothing. We are useless without him. We need him. You are not higher than anyone. All of us are nothing. If Jesus Yes. could say without him I am nothing. What about me and without him we are nothing. [Music] We should always seek for help when we need it. Hallelujah. And when we come before the Lord we should accept vulnerability. Oh, when I go and I begin crying, say, "Oh, Father, help me." They will say, "I'm a big sinner. So what?" Are they not? They're bigger sinners than you and they're worse off than you because you have accepted to show your vulnerability for his presence. Hallelujah. I want I want to show you this thing here. God came down and he said, "Soul, because of your hard hard because I'm not obeying me. Because of your stubbornness, I have rejected you from being king. Oh God, use me. God use me." You don't need even to pray for him to use you. Just break in his prayers. Be humble. You remember when God chose Saul, he was [Music] humble. He had obeyed his father to go look for a lost. That man was humble. He was a nobody. God loves choosing little nobodyies. He made him a prophet. when he was a nobody. When God chooses you and you accept his God, even when you nobody can make a after he has made you a somebody remain broken in his presence. Hallelujah. I want you to see here when God now chooses another man. I want you to see the criteria. The criteria or the the criteria of choice. Yes. Amen. 1 Samuel 13:8. and heed seven days according to the seven set time that someone had [Music] appointed and but Samuel came not to Gila and the people were scattered from here. So here listen listen church please. So here is Saul in this place waiting for the prophet to come and make the sacrifice. That was not the duty of a king. That was the duty of a prophet stroke priest. But we see here the people were scattering from soul. And verse 9 says, "And Saul said, bring his ab offering to me. Bring the peace offerings also." And he offered the burnt offering. And it came to pass As soon as he had made an end of the offering, the burnt offering, behold, brother Samuel came, now I want to see this man. Is he humble or he is proud? And Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him. And Samuel said, prophet to a king. Now, what have you done? Pastor to a millionaire brother. No, pastor to a millionaire brother. What have you done? You know, many churches, they tend to respect rich people. They even give them front seats. those ones they cannot do anything to them. You cannot rebuke a rich person because if they get angry around the church, the church loses offering. But in the message, whether you are poor or you are rich, you are a brother, you are a sister. There is no honorable brothers. Honorable sisters, if you're a honorable out when you are here, you were a brother. Hallelujah. Therefore, we should always feel the same. There are some churches where they don't respect poor people, they respect rich ones. And when the offering comes from the rich brothers, the pastor will pray until he will sweat. But when it is from a poor sister, brother, God bless him. Amen. But I'm so glad. We are not among those. We are the bride of Christ. We have been delivered from those things. We are in another place. We are in the bright age. Hallelujah. We are getting ready for the coming of the Lord. The things of the world, they can't take us. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Amen. We don't despise anyone. We respect everyone. Hallelujah. And if you have ever felt despised by anyone, that person who despised you is the one with the problem. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Listen. So Saul was being asked by the prophet, what have you done? And Saul said, I expected him to say, the man of God. But what did he say? Oh, I saw that the people were scattered for me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and the Philistines gathered themselves together. Therefore, Therefore, said I, the Philistines will come down upon me to Gila, and I have not made supplication unto the Lord. I forced myself and I offered the B offering. But pastor because you came late. I decided to do it my myself. You have your responsibility and even a pastor has a deacon has his respian. Everybody here has which God gave others that is your responsibility that is not allotted to you that is pride say done foolishly th not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God which you commanded thee. For now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Isa forever, but now kingdom shall not continue. The Lord assought him a man after his own heart. Amen. The Lord ass. Do you know there are people living on earth today? There are me men and women. Who are those? Those are the ones who have a broken heart. Those are the ones who accept to be vulnerable in his presence. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Lord has commanded him to be captain over his people. When he says you shall be heads, not tails. He doesn't mean everybody. He means these ones, the vulnerable one. You shall be heads and not tails. Amen. Amen. Because you have kept because you have kept the commandment of the Lord, he will remove it from the others and he will give it to you. Let me tell you, brethren, I'm giving you a principle today. If you want favor from God, just be vulnerable. be vulnerable in his presence because there are some brothers, there are some sisters who are proud, who are proud, who cannot be corrected. God is getting ready. He will take that grace which had given to them. They will not go to hell. He will remove it from them and give it to you and he will use you. He will make you glad. Oh, this is the kind of blessing that you did not ask for. You do not pray for them. You did not fast for them. You did not plead for them. The only thing you did was to be vulnerable in his presence to cry out to him in prayer to be obedient to him. Oh, if God can give us two, three, four brothers here that can be vulnerable in his presence. When they sin, they quickly repent. When they go astray, they quickly come back. They cry out to the Lord. Those are the ones he's looking for. Amen. David was not a perfect man. David was a man that kind of man that had the ability of lasting after a woman who was not his wife and actually took her. He did not stop there. He had the ability of killing the husband, a man who committed adultery, a man who committed, a man who murdered. But yet God still say he is a man after my heart. What? So a man after God is heart perfect man is a man who accepts to be vulnerable. When the prophet of God came down, he told he told David, "Oh, there is this someone to who went and stole the neighbor's field." Was it a field of sheep and he killed it for his friends? And yet this one had only one and the other had. and the pretending king, the hypoc hypocritical king. Many of us many times we pretend we are actually hypocrites. Many times and that's okay as long as you can eventually break down before the Lord and repent. But you see, When the king heard that he said what? Who has done that? He is to be killed. And the prophet said, "Live long the king. You are the one." The king did not say, "I want you to see the difference between soul and death. David not say no I have no problem I was just you know in my place and this girl was showering naked there it was a problem and the heavens were open and I did not mean it even the mother of I did not do it with my hand I only told Joah to put him on the front Is he not a soldier? What did he sign up for? He died. So what have I done? But what did he do? He didn't explain. He didn't reason with God. He didn't question the prophet. He didn't rebuke the man of God. He faced the wall and started crying crying unto you. You alone have I s Please God take away my sins. Wash me with your cleans me and make me whole. Create in me and clean out of every do not take away your Holy Ghost. That's a man that has a broken heart. That's a man that is vulnerable in the presence of God. He was honest. He was a man after God is on hand. And then immediately God forgave him. His first son died. But the same woman who he had strength for Muria gave birth to his second son who became Solomon, the next king of Israel. Talk about grace. Hallelujah. I know that favor be vulnerable before him will give you grace you don't desire men talking and saying you did that will say I don't know what they did because your sins see for us it doesn't matter your Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What matters is you have been vulnerable. Others have done what you have done. You explained it away. They're living with it. They pretending with it. But for you, you broke down in his word. That is the difference. Hallelujah. That is what God accepts. He said to this man, "Will I look that has a broken heart and a contrast?" Hallelujah. Amen. In many psalms, David expresses fear. He expresses guilt. He expresses sadness and a longing. He hides nothing from God. There are many Psalms I would have read. But here in Psalm 66, he says, "I'm weary with my groaning. All the night I make my bed to swim. I water my couch with my tears. He was a vulnerable man, but yet a man after. When God chooses to use you, it's not because you're perfect, brother. Amen. It's not because you're perfect, sir. It is because you have accepted vulnerability. And then he gives you another chance and then he gives you grace. But where you hide away and you pretend he will reject you. You see God told brother he says how many of some will raise up your hands and say that you have you heard me say that the Holy Spirit told me that it would come to pass that if I be sincere not greedy with money not be try to be some big person but be humble and keep little and know that he would give to me the gift to know the secret of the heart. So you you tell me that God gives gifts the way he wants. He has a basis. God is a sin. He told the prophet, "I've given you, I am going to add, if you please me, your heart, if it pleases me without greedy, if you are, if you are honest, I've given you the healing and I will add I will add you God will add on you what he has given you. It is the beginning. Hallelujah. Amen. What he has given you just the beginning. Just be sincere. Be humble. Keep little and low. To those of you who get a job or who who get some kind of management or you get an educational kind of thing you get whatever whatever you have God is getting ready to add but there is a condition you will keep humble little and low be sincere then he's going to How many knows that I said that would happen and then the prophet says 1959. Now that has happened. Now he promised me keep humble and I will do exceedingly [Music] abundantly. And I tell you the same thing today, brethren. Keep humble. Be sincere. Be honorable. God will do ability. Hallelujah. Amen. Before I finish, I I want you to give me 20 more minutes. I here in life story. I'm going to take my time to read for you this because many of you are bad readers. I want you to to read it for you. I want you to hear it. Brother Bham gives his life story. And here he gives a story about his family. He had his first wife. And because brother Bam refused to listen to God, he refused to go serve God. God killed that woman. If you refuse to be sincere to be vulnerable, don't you worry. God will force you. But his hand when he forces you is terrible. None of us want it. Let us learn from this story. is quite something disturbing but it happened in William Brham's life and we can use it as an example and I will begin in the middle because of time but then he says I thought it was something funny when she got to Fort Wayne she he's talking about his wife she had to get another pair of stockings So here he is giving a story. His wife wanted some stocks and he went and bought them. But you know he was proud. She didn't want the woman the shopkeeper to know that he did not know the differences in the socks. So he got the one which is not the type of his wife. And and so later on at the on the deathbed his wife tells him, "You remember those socks?" Actually, those were not my size. But brother Bam, when he went to the shop, this woman said, "Which type does she want?" And she mentioned the name. And brother said, "Yes, that's right. Yeah, give me those." So when he took it home, the sister didn't say anything. But what if she did? She gave it to the mother and for her she bought others. And and so that's the part here he's talking about. But she told me she said there in her dying hour. She said, "Bill them was for an older woman. I gave them to your mother." She said that she said I kept that from you because I didn't want to hurt your feelings that you got oh my you don't know how but made me feel I said bless your heart honey she's at the hospital right now hospital bed almost dying and they're having this moment together so she looked up and she said I'm going and I said are you honey she Yes. I said, "Sweetheart, when you go and then he says here, you believe anything you want to, he's not talking to you." Brother B is talking to us. Believe anything you want to. I don't believe a Christian dies. There is no scripture for it in the Bible. No sir. He that hearth my words and believe on him that sent me has passed from death to life. I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live, and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Can we all say amen to that? So I said, "Honey, I will take your body out here and I'll bury it up there in walnut region and if Jesus tries, I'll be in the battlefield somewhere. If not, I will be buried by your side. I said that morning when the sun refuses to shine. The moon turns black like blood. I said the world is all cold and waiting. You go to the city gates. If you go before me, I said you go over to the city gates on the east side and you stand there. When you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, them coming in, I said, talking to his wife, go to the screaming, begin screaming, Bill just as loud as you can. And I said, I'll get the kidies together. I'll get them together, the children, and I'll meet you there at the In other words, he's telling the wife, don't you worry, honey. we will meet on the Easter. And she raised up them bony hands and embraced around it. I kissed her goodbye. She closed her eyes and we went to meet our God. That was my last date with my wife and by the grace of God I'm trying to my best to make double time. That's the reason I tried so hard to preach day and night one campaign after another trying to make up for what I lost one day. If you refuse to pray, God will let situations happen to you that they will make you pray 24 hours. If you refuse to come to church and you a Christian, God will allow situations to bring you here until you will be the one coming here before any service open. You can even call the person to see if you have a service on Tuesday. God is able to do anything. Have a broken heart. Don't let God make you. If you you refuse to leave that sin and you refuse to break down and seek for help, God will allow things to happen that he will humble you that you will never even want to smell that sin. Brother Brandham refused to preach now because of what happened. He is saying now I preach day and night. I'm trying to make up for the lost. Oh, it was hard when I went home. I went home. I tried to go to bed. Mother wanted me to come over home. I couldn't. And then I remember I went over to our little old place. There wasn't nothing there. And we didn't have nothing. I guess $10 would have bought everything we had in the house. But it was ours. She kept it clean. And it was ours. And there was no place like home. But now she's gone. Now she's gone. He's all by himself. I don't care how humble it is. There's no place like home. So, brother Bam, when his wife died, he he tried to go to his mother's place, he couldn't fit there. He went back to his home, but he wasn't home anymore because his wife was no longer there. You know, if you want to follow the story, it was because the wife of um the the mother of this woman had refused to brother take this woman to the meetings and campaigns and things like that and he obeyed. See these things that happened. She died and now he's gone home and there is nothing. It doesn't look like home. He says, he says it was so small. Some of you have so small things at home. Brother says at this time, $10, that's about 30,000 shillings, was able to buy the things they had in their home. Don't despise what you have. As long as you are happy and God has given you those things with a clean heart, serve him faithfully. Appreciate what you have. And he's saying she the wife used to keep it clean and he says I went over there and laid down try to go sleep that night. I never forget it. I know a little old mouse had gotten down a great way. We had some papers up there and I heard she used to lay there and she would have her some candy. and his wife would give her something and I sounds like hands and I I got crying when he had the command. Appreciate your wife if you still have her. Appreciate your husband if you still appreciate those small moments that you have. And I started crying. And I shut the door together. And hanging on the back of the door was was her kimono hanging on the back of her door. And oh my, there it was all over again. And and while I was laying there crying, someone knocked at the door. It was he it was the man is called Bro. And he come and he said, "Brother Billy," I said, "Yes, sir. He said, "I got some bad news for you." I said, "Brother Frank, I just took her to the mock." He said, "That's not all of it. Your baby's dying also shall be lost." I said, "Surely I said Dr. Ad is taking He said Dr. Ad is taking her to the hospital now. He thinks she's dying and I couldn't hold it no longer. I got up and I tried to walk. I couldn't do it. My strength was all gone. They had held me by the arms. He set me in the old truck and he took me out there at the hospital and I walked in and there was some Dr. Sama there standing at the door. He said, "Billy, don't go to her. She's dying, Sunny. She's contracted from her mother this tuberculosis many injured many." It went to the spine and said she's dying. You can't go to see her said on account of Billy Paul. You can't go to see her because he had another son who if he went see this one also get the sickness and bring it to. I said talk. I got to see my baby. I said, "Let me see her. Won't you talk?" He said, "Bill, I can't do it on his men in son. If you carry in your clothes somewhere else, I said you can carry it out." I said, "Doc, let me go down there. Give me some chloroform. Give me some chloroform and let me die with her. I said life. What is it to me now? Everything I've got is God. I'm talking about the story of a prophet. A man of God that he used. This is what he went through. hate him because of refusing to be vulnerable and he started crying and a nurse stood there and said I can't let you go in there brother when she turned her back I slipped anyhow and went down into the basement isolated place a very cheap like hospital And there down there they had this little cheese she clo laying over her face to keep the flies off to keep the flies off. He's talking about his little girl and her little spasms she was having with that that many jets had knocked that off. And the flies was in her little baby's eyes. If you don't have a child, you may not understand. But these things are difficult to read. and I shued the flies off of her eyes and looked at her and said, "Sh, honey, you are not going to leave, daddy, are you?" And I looked at her little old fat leg and her little crimple hand. Yeah. because of the sickness. Yes, the leg was fat, the hand was crippled, holding like that as she was drawing, quivering. And she was looking at me, little old lips quivering. I said, Sharon, are you going to leave, daddy? And looked like she was quivering so like she looked up at me. She was suffering so hard. till one of those little baby eyes, her little eyes was crossed like that looked at her suffering. She was looked like she was trying to reach her little hand and it just tore my heart. I thought oh god from that day that's the reason cross eye children just can't stand to look at them brother Brham in all his ministry he would look at a crosseyed child and heal her immediately some didn't even have eyes because of what he went through and it made invulnerable. She would look at that person and one time he prayed and eyes popped up. See her little eyes was crossed like that. You know, God does those things. He has to crush something to get the good out of it and the prophet was being crushed so he can become a man of God. I seen that little thing I kneel down on the floor and I said, "Oh, dear God, I'm sorry that I did what I did. You took my wife, my darling away from me. Now you are taking my baby. Oh God, please don't take my little girl. I love her with all my heart. I said I'll serve you. I've done all I know to do except I did not go when you told me. I said please don't take my baby. I said I love her and no please tell me God. I said take me instead of this is a man who God is training to be vulnerable. If you don't accept to be vulnerable by the word, God will allow situation to come and train you. as I raise I'm I'm showing you here these things happened before the international ministry brother and that's why brotherham was the most humble servant of God and everyone else talked about the humility of to tell the story. Don't interret tell the story so people can follow. Amen. So as I raised my eyes, I looked like a black it looked like a black sheet coming unfolded. I know she was going there. So I raised up and looked at her. I said, "God bless you, honey." I said, "Your daddy's darling." I laid my hand over her head. I said, "Oh God," I said, "I don't know why you are tearing me up like this." But I said, "Still that doesn't change my faith in you." And I said, "A job of God be with you, honey. In a few minutes, the angels will come and pack your soul to mother. I'll pick you up from here. I will pick you up from here and lay you in mother's arms and bury you to God. I said, Lord, I've done all I can. It's not my will now that thy will be done. I laid my hand on her little head like that. I couldn't hold myself no more. I felt myself slinking and went down to the floor. If God wants to humble you, he can humble you. Listen to me. You who is running away from his presence. God can humble you. And don't make a mistake of you thinking I'm scaring you today. I'm giving you a a principle of the word. If God is interested in you, he will do anything to humble you. But don't let him do it because the way he does it, you will never love it. I felt myself slinking and I went down to the floor. The angels of God come picked her and took her little soul away. Her little mouth quit quivering and her little legs straightened out. God taken her away. And I stood there, my heart mashed pieces. God loves a broken heart. God broke it. Don't let God break it. But I thought Oh God, oh mercy, I said, Lord, why don't you just take me long when I was a kid? Everybody laughed at me. They called me I went hungry and I went without and everything else. Here it comes out to a place. You give me a little home. I try to live right. Then you give me a little home. Don't take it away from me. Go let me go with them. I said don't let me stay here. I don't want to stay. I cried and lifted up my hands to him. I said but down in my heart there something. I love you. No matter what you have done, I love you Lord. I lift up my hand my my hands to him. So the nurse come in looked at the baby and crossed his little hand. She come and picked me up went out. Few days later we took her up there on the hill. Brother Smith the Methodist preacher standing there preaching the funeral. When they went out to lower her down with the mother man, I looked at her. He got some old uh clothes of of dirt in his hand and I saw that I couldn't stand it. Little By Paul was leaning on my arm [Music] here, 18 months old. And he goes ahead to tell the story of how Billy Billy poor didn't know what was happening. But then he said, "There's a land beyond the river that they call a street forever. We only reach that shore by faith decree. One by one we gained a portal there to dwell with a mortal." Someday the ring has gold and bell for you and me. I will turn out from the grave. It became real to him. He became really vulnerable. When God told him go, he went. When God told him stop because the gift God gave him needed him to be sensitive to the spirit. Yes. He had to be an o obedient man. One time it was somewhere you know the plane was grounded and the Holy Spirit told him now move. He moved. Turn. He turn. He turn. And then he found a sick dying child. First of all, he understood what it means for a mother to lose a child. Secondly, understood what it is to obey God. He was vulnerable. He was weak and ready to hear and obey. Brother, sister, that is Christianity. Have a soft heart for God. God chose to use brother Bannon. First of all, he was born from a poor body. First of all, he was first fell sick. He almost died. He wrote that stanza though I have suffered in many a way. What's the next word? I cried for my healing because he was sick in the hospital. He was almost dying. Both night and day, faith wasn't forgotten by the father. You know, he wrote this that stanza, gave me a sign on the wings of death. He knew what he was talking about. Oh, we need people who are so vulnerable. They will write song that they write be inspired to preach. the whisper to sing, the whisper to play by revelation by vulnerability. You will come to church by vulnerability. You will know you don't have to say after all they have called us what will I do. No, you because you're drawn to God. He once felt sick, almost died. He felt He felt everything but strong and able. He was very weak. God reduced him to nothing. He fell down and cried like a baby. He was a man that was truly vulnerable before the presence of [Music] God. I'm sorry for taking time today, but this is a very important question. By the time left that place, God took him out. He took him to the whole world. Amen. Tens of millions of people were saved and healed and delivered because this was a servant humble obey obedience. Many times when you suffer things, it's because you are not vulnerable. And God is interested in you. He wants to use you. And with God, it doesn't matter how long it takes with Moses. It took 40 years until Moses became vulnerable. He said, "Now God, I'm ready." Not ready because he felt wanting to do. God hears that cry of I'm ready. When you say I cannot do [Music] anything, I am useless. When you feel that, it's time for God to use you. So God choose to use David. He was a man that was really vulnerable. He opened up his heart before the Lord in every situation. when he was angry, when he was sinful, when he was mad at God, when he felt, he always opened up. Said, "Oh, God, search me from the inward parts. He he would speak things that no one would even dare speak." And on Wednesday, I'll continue. There's much more talk about it. But friends, I tell you, may God help you, help me, help all of us to break down in the presence of the Holy Spirit. It's a gift when you have it. It's a blessing when you have it. when you can sing a song and you just break down in his presence. You know when when when you you're not singing out to just sing but you're singing out because something has been made personal for you. Shall we stand on our feet? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. May God help us and restore that old time religion to us. I think brother Amram, you always sing that song. Can you help us sing that first stance again? And he says, "No one knew how alone I was feeling and the emptiness I tried so hard to hide." God just led brotherh brother Iranius to sing that just at the right time. Although I laughed and said my life was fine without you. I was covering up the secret tears as I cried. It's time to bring them out. It's time to no longer cover up. Then one day someone told me of your mercy and the love you showed on a hill. There you die and purchase my redemption. when you broke sin's power and set my spirit free. I pray that you will do that for someone else. Amen. Help me, brother. Help me. Help me sing it. That first stanza. Hallelujah. If you have the words, brother, give it to us. Let us all try to sing them if we can. I knew how alone I was. Yes, Lord. And the emptyness I tried so much to. [Music] Oh, I laughed and said my life was finally without you. I was covering up the sacred Jesus. And one day told me your mercy. Yes, Lord. want to heal Calvary. There you punches my redemption. When you broke sinless power and set my spirit freeing now I'm amaz that that you love me. [Music] I'm a [Applause] man that you gave. Through your graious blood, I found my s [Music] away.

Many times trying to go astray, but I've learned that your love is stronger. I will learn that your love is stronger than my weakness. And your ear is open every time I pray. And your ear is open every time I pray. No one else has ever cared for me. For me like you. Yes, Lord. Other friends would never be as close to me. I'm not afraid.

I give myself. [Music] Friends, I want to tell you something [Music] today. While we are in his presence, You [Music] see brokenness comes from two things. You can never force yourself to be broken. It is impossible. But you see brokenness comes from two things. It can come from one of them. [Music] It can come from hearing the word. When you hear the word and you open your heart and then he convicts you, that brings brokenness, makes you cry out to him, makes you worship him, makes you break out in a worship, in repentance, in tears, in crying out. But if it doesn't come from that, then it can come from a broken heart. We've seen a man I've read for you here that had a broken heart, things he went through broken. I don't know about you. I would not want to go through things to get broken. I would want at the hearing of his word to open my heart and listen to the voice of the spirit and let him break me. Let him mold me. Let him make me a man, a woman I want to [Music] be. Even as we leave this place, I want you to meditate about what you have heard and ask [Music] him. Spend time in prayer. It's a sacrifice you have to make. Find time every day. Each of us, we should find time every day and and be in communication with the Lord. This cultivates brokenness. You just have to be vulnerable in his [Music] presence. Don't worry about the state you are in. Whatever state you are in, you approach him the way you are. He will always understand. Let me pray for you. Maybe you want say I I need prayer. This was for me. I need prayer. Maybe those of you at the altar, just let him know your need. Open up your heart. Wherever you are, just lift. Let us pray together. Oh, Holy Spirit, loving Jesus. We love you, Lord. Many times Lord we are carried away by things. We are carried away by circumstances. But Lord we have heard today. You would take away what you had given to one man and you would give it to another. Because this man had a heart like thine. This was a heart which was willing to say Lord I'm sorry. A heart which was willing to cry out to you. A heart which was willing to say created me. Renew a right spirit within me. Take your holy spirit not away from me. treat me with high Lord, a heart which was willing to cry out and say, I wet my pillows at night. I cry out because I'm desperate for you. To the people of the world, that is weakness. But to you, that is strength. He said to this man, "Will I look that has a broken heart and a contrite spirit? Help me, Lord. Help me, Lord Jesus. That I will also be more sincere, that I'll not preach to others and I lose it myself. Oh, help me, Jesus. Help all the ministers here, Lord. Help every brother, every sister that we may not miss it Lord. It may not become usual unc. But this will be something that we crave afterward to be in your presence, vulnerable in your presence where we can find a a spot and we go out and cry out to you. Many people when they have problems they go to things they go to [Music] people they get headaches they get confused many commit suicide many go into a depression many go into anxiety make wrong decisions help us Jesus that we will become vulnerable before you will tell you exactly what we feel and how we feel because you are our solution every time. You have solution for us every time we come before you. Lord, have your way Lord Jesus do not reject us but receive us father as we come with an open heart. Grant I pray Lord be with us now as we shall dismiss until we meet again. We love you Lord. We just worship your name. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I give myself [Laughter] [Music] away. Give myself away. Brother Shalom. Come on. So you can use me. I give myself away. Is there anyone who would like to give their life to Jesus? Please come away. God bless you. You can come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless you. Are you the one? Come, brother. We've had several brethren doing outreach in their home cells. There's a home sale of brother Dan but said brother. Amen. The sister is coming from that area. Amen. Shall we pray together? Jesus Christ. [Music] [Music] Amen. Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] Uh sister, we are going to I was told you you are you the one who came with your brothers ready to be baptized? Okay. We we are going to arrange for your baptism today. Uh we baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in much water. Amen. That's what the Bible promised. That's what God instructed and that's what we do. You are baptized in which religion? Uhhuh. You are you are from Catholicism direct from Catholicism to the message. Hallelujah. Wonderful. So you you've you are not joining another church. No, you are you're interpreting. You are you are getting born into the body of Christ. Like your church is not joined. a denomination, a religion you can join. But the true church of Jesus is a family. You are born into it. And you become a member of that by the Holy Spirit. So you've repented, you are going to baptize, and now God promised he will feed you with the Holy Spirit. Now when you receive him from that moment you are born into the body. Praise the name of the Lord. And so you are in a journey and we want to say to welcome you. Amen. You were known before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. You've just found out today. But you were always a part of him. We were always a part of him. Let us give a hand to our Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. And I see almost 50% or 40% never came because of rain. I I'll let you know that we are in a season of rain and um it's going to be raining almost every Sunday morning. So if you are going to miss church because of rain, You're really going to be at home for a long time. So please fight. I sent you a text on WhatsApp. Always get ready. Prepare early and try and come on time. Amen. Uh, brother Emma, sister um Sara, brother Julius, Julius, brother Shem, his wife, sister Favor, these came all the way from and rain did not hinder them. We should give them a hand to pray. God bless you. So we shall now be going to the service in and I heard there's a testimony. Who has a testimony? [Music] God bless you brethren. I've come to thank God for two issues and even to testify. I thank God when this last week was starting. We have a young person we work with at the shop. The woman who serves tea brought tea to him and the child poured the tea on on himself. Child has been bedridden so badly off. for seven days. But God has had mercy on us. The baby is getting better. The second miracle God did for me yesterday. Thieves came and stole my phone at my workplace. I wanted to rush and do it my way. But let alone I went to the room where we keep our money and I said Lord I can do this on my own but you have the eye. You have the eye which saw the person who took my phone and you know where they are. They say Lord tell that person to bring it back. Brethren, somebody brought the phone [Applause] back after 3 hours with the phone. They brought the phone back. I thank God's [Music] grace. And I told the thieves he had taken a born again his phone, but God caught you and told you to bring it back. And I told him, I won't do anything. you go back. It was God who touched you. I thank God. God bless you. When you have when you become vulnerable in his presence, things are done and be I have money. Then you go to police and you track. When you can do nothing and you go before his presence, things are done. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you for that testimony. Father will lead us in the songs as we dismiss. We meet on Wednesday. We can greet one another. Shalom.
