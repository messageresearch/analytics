[33:20] thankful

[33:34] funerals are the most ugliest things
[33:37] they are not nice
[33:40] yet it's part of life
[33:42] but to us God has been gracious God has
[33:46] been kind amen
[33:48] maybe if my laws can be a bit
[33:52] of laws can be a bit High it would be
[33:55] fine especially on the monitors
[33:58] um
[34:00] so today I've got a couple of brothers
[34:03] that I want to come up here
[34:05] just share
[34:08] What the Lord Has Done in their lives
[34:11] I've been talking to them in the week
[34:13] and I said you know what you need to
[34:14] come and just share with us briefly what
[34:18] God has done for you
[34:20] amen I'm gonna ask brother Zippo to come
[34:23] come forward
[34:24] when I was talking to him he says pastor
[34:27] I'm a bit nervous to stand before the
[34:31] people
[34:32] but I believe you know when God has done
[34:34] something for you
[34:35] you know
[34:38] you want to testify about it
[34:41] praise the Lord you can come forward
[34:43] brother Zippo God bless you
[34:48] greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:50] Christ
[34:51] amen
[34:54] the pastor is right
[34:56] I'm a bit nervous and I told him during
[34:59] the week that I'm not used to standing
[35:01] in front of the people
[35:03] especially the children of God
[35:06] but I'm so happy
[35:08] that the god that we serve
[35:11] is a true God
[35:15] who is the god that has actually removed
[35:17] the children of Israel from bondage with
[35:21] his mighty hand
[35:23] he's a God who still manifests today
[35:28] during the beginning of the year
[35:31] when we open the
[35:34] congregation
[35:37] the pastor mentioned
[35:40] something positive about DCM
[35:44] I might not put it in his context
[35:49] but I'll tell you how
[35:51] I have received it
[35:54] it was something that was telling me
[35:56] that
[35:58] whatever that is in the weight
[36:01] whatever that is preached
[36:04] it is something that is going to
[36:06] manifest in action this year
[36:10] and I'm standing before you to tell you
[36:12] that yes indeed our God is the great God
[36:16] and he has never failed me he is the
[36:19] true God
[36:21] so he said that when the enemy shall
[36:24] come like a flood he will raise the
[36:26] standard
[36:28] when you're seeing the pastor standing
[36:30] in front of us
[36:31] they carrying the weight it is the
[36:34] standard he's raising that standard to
[36:37] us
[36:38] well I'm gonna go to the testimony which
[36:41] I've told my pastor
[36:44] back at work I'm actually working at
[36:46] school metals
[36:48] we are making steel in that company
[36:52] so during the beginning of the month
[36:55] we had an encounter
[36:58] whereby the employees
[37:01] started
[37:03] to have to it I will call itoi if you
[37:06] want me to call it that way
[37:08] but basically they were craving they had
[37:10] some grievances which actually caused
[37:13] them to do a work stoppage
[37:17] so I'm not gonna be long but I'm just
[37:19] gonna put it in brief but tell you how
[37:21] that has changed me how has that made me
[37:25] to realize that our God is the true God
[37:29] so my brothers and sisters and my
[37:31] pastors before me I want to say that the
[37:35] employees embarked on that strike for
[37:37] something like eight days
[37:41] and management stood up and told them
[37:43] that you know what what you're doing is
[37:45] not right
[37:47] so they gave them an ultimatum to say
[37:49] they need to go back to work
[37:52] however they proceeded
[37:55] with the toy Towing
[37:57] and then later management decided that
[38:00] no now we're going to court to obtain a
[38:03] court interdict
[38:05] which is basically going to prevent
[38:07] distract strike from going further and
[38:10] causing more and more damage because we
[38:13] are living in difficult times
[38:15] these days so this hunger there's
[38:18] poverty there's every sorts of things so
[38:21] when a company is not working it's not
[38:24] only the company that gets affected but
[38:26] it's the children at home the wives and
[38:29] everyone else gets affected so the
[38:31] company had to intervene when it
[38:34] intervened obtained that interdict which
[38:36] said destruct the strike should be
[38:39] called off and yes indeed it was called
[38:41] off
[38:44] but as it was called off it was not in a
[38:47] peaceful manner because police said to
[38:50] intervene intervene people got injured
[38:54] others got
[38:56] to be taken to the hospital so it was
[38:59] not something that was nice
[39:02] but I want to tell you that afterwards
[39:05] management came back and issued each and
[39:09] every employee
[39:11] with a final written warning
[39:14] especially
[39:16] the employees who were involved but let
[39:19] me put it this way especially the
[39:21] employees who are under the organization
[39:23] of numsa because it was that Union which
[39:26] was basically
[39:28] working I mean a Toyota
[39:33] and then all of all of the employees got
[39:36] those final written only
[39:38] and then I also received the final
[39:40] eating warning
[39:42] why simply because the Judgment of the
[39:46] Court did not judge individuals however
[39:50] it judged the union to say the union was
[39:54] at fault at fault for engaging in an
[39:57] unprotected strike so in other words
[40:00] that strike was very much illegal so as
[40:03] a result everyone had to be given that
[40:05] final written warning I also received
[40:08] when my manager came to me and said this
[40:11] is your
[40:13] final written warning I was like
[40:16] surprise shocked and thinking
[40:18] of all the sacrifices that I'm making
[40:21] for the company and sometimes I even
[40:24] have to skip church on Sundays and come
[40:27] and work for the company but now I
[40:30] happen to be the one also who is
[40:32] receiving that final written warning
[40:36] then I I didn't argue or dispute
[40:40] he just showed me sign here
[40:44] we know it that when we have received a
[40:47] final written warning we are human we
[40:49] make mistake each and every day so I
[40:52] would make one mistake then I'm out of
[40:54] the gate so I went back to my office
[40:57] but when I was there
[41:00] I was in grief I was crying
[41:05] crying to the Lord
[41:07] that why me Lord that I'm facing such a
[41:10] thing
[41:11] and yet I also remembered that at some
[41:14] stage
[41:16] I asked my pastor
[41:18] to pray for me at work
[41:21] and I then started to think of that
[41:24] situation differently I looked at the
[41:27] issue of shetric meshech and abedniko
[41:30] that they were faced to go into the fear
[41:34] In fairness however the mighty hand of
[41:37] God also helped them to go through it
[41:41] without being banned without being
[41:44] harmed in that fairness
[41:47] later
[41:49] when everyone had received those final
[41:52] written warnings people were called
[41:54] again for the second time to say
[41:57] you've been involved in that strike but
[42:00] you were seen carrying some dangerous
[42:03] weapon you were seen blocking cars you
[42:06] were seen doing this and that which is
[42:08] illegal and therefore now we're giving
[42:11] you a notice
[42:12] so that notice basically saying that
[42:15] they need to come before the
[42:17] disciplinary hearing and the end of it
[42:20] it's going to be a dismissal
[42:22] I'm standing before you saying that
[42:24] about 40 already are already facing
[42:28] dismissal and this week there's another
[42:30] ones who are going to be facing
[42:32] dismissal
[42:34] but late I think last week if I'm not
[42:37] mistaken
[42:40] um my manager called me and said to me
[42:43] come come to my office and then I came
[42:45] to his office
[42:47] and then he said to me uh Zippo
[42:52] I understood understand that have we've
[42:55] given you the company has given you a
[42:57] final written warning
[43:00] and I would like to say that on behalf
[43:02] of the company the company sincerely
[43:05] apologizes to you
[43:07] and we would like to reject that um
[43:12] that
[43:14] [Applause]
[43:16] that final written warning
[43:18] and remember it's not only the final
[43:20] written warning so they had said that we
[43:23] are even taking the eight days that
[43:26] there was strike because you were a
[43:28] member of the
[43:30] um of the Union I joined that Union
[43:32] because of my father and mother my
[43:35] mother is uh 85 my uh father 90 no one
[43:41] bought it the wrong way my mother is 90
[43:43] the older one and my father is 85 years
[43:46] so there's a funeral cover which was
[43:49] attached to that so I couldn't really
[43:51] drop that Union because I was holding on
[43:54] to that my parents are still alive
[43:57] so they said we're giving you back even
[44:00] those days we're going to pay you for
[44:02] those days
[44:03] so amen
[44:06] [Music]
[44:07] so I want to say glory to God because
[44:10] this God if you think that we are
[44:12] standing before a mountain
[44:15] you know a mountain it can be physical
[44:16] as you know it the mountain is physical
[44:19] however I'm saying anything that makes
[44:23] you not to see on the other side is
[44:26] actually a mountain if you thinking
[44:28] today that what am I going to eat
[44:30] tomorrow what am I going to do tomorrow
[44:33] how am I going to feed my children it's
[44:36] a mountain but God has promised that as
[44:39] lead if you've got as little as a
[44:41] mustard seed
[44:43] is able to move your Mountain so he has
[44:46] moved mine and I thank him glory to God
[44:50] Amen thank you
[44:53] praise God Amen God bless you
[44:56] [Applause]
[45:01] if you have never been faced with the
[45:04] final written warning
[45:05] and 40 people are dismissed and 40 more
[45:08] are coming
[45:09] you will not understand that
[45:12] and you have a family to feed
[45:15] and then God reverses that
[45:18] and for the eight days you have not been
[45:21] going to work while people are talking
[45:22] they say we're going to pay you
[45:25] that's the god that we sell
[45:27] amen praise God I'm going to ask brother
[45:32] and delay to come and briefly share with
[45:34] us is testimony amen
[45:40] God bless your Saints amen
[45:44] my testimony is
[45:47] almost exactly like the brothers women
[45:51] I am about two years ago I was actually
[45:54] suspended at work
[45:58] they said I've committed fraud
[46:01] and that was a false accusation of
[46:04] course
[46:05] then in that during that time
[46:09] six months later they came back to me
[46:13] and said no we have withdrawn those
[46:16] charges amen
[46:18] so
[46:19] after that they
[46:21] just put another charges now
[46:24] they fabricated new charges told me that
[46:28] a
[46:29] and I've misused the
[46:32] state vehicle State resources and
[46:35] everything
[46:36] amen
[46:37] now
[46:39] I went back home they didn't revoke that
[46:44] suspension amen
[46:46] so
[46:48] during that time I was stressing
[46:51] there's depression
[46:53] and literally I we I we also had a
[46:59] challenges when it comes now going to
[47:01] church because I was in Pretoria at that
[47:03] time amen so the devil was just
[47:07] attacking me all the hallway amen
[47:10] so now
[47:12] about
[47:14] to just to cut this testimony short amen
[47:17] this place is not easy to stand
[47:22] so about
[47:24] um
[47:25] three months ago
[47:27] we started coming here amen
[47:30] that's when we were always blessed and
[47:33] we were still praying for the situation
[47:35] amen
[47:36] and
[47:38] just two weeks back when the pastor was
[47:41] preaching about God is not ashamed lean
[47:44] not on your own understandable
[47:46] that's when he just mentioned my
[47:50] situation exactly as it was it just said
[47:55] you know they can falsely accuse you at
[47:58] work so if and not continue correct me
[48:00] but but
[48:02] um if they falsely accuse you if and
[48:06] they continued and continued and just
[48:08] said yes I'm talking to you right now I
[48:11] don't know who you are but I'm talking
[48:14] to you and like I was looking at my wife
[48:17] now saying
[48:19] tell the pastor or something what's
[48:21] happening here but later I realized that
[48:24] it was the Holy Ghost speaking to my
[48:27] situation amen and
[48:31] it was on Wednesday on Friday that week
[48:36] I received a call from work to say come
[48:39] on Monday and get your verdict amen I
[48:42] remember it was now two years going for
[48:44] three years I think
[48:46] so Monday I went there sitting that Big
[48:50] Board Room never spraying my wife
[48:54] praying at home
[48:56] and I'm glad to tell you a Believers
[48:59] that all charges were dropped against
[49:01] you
[49:03] know nothing so I would like to thank
[49:07] the Lord for that amen lean not into thy
[49:11] own understanding amen
[49:14] praise the Lord
[49:19] praise God Amen
[49:23] you see it's the same testimony
[49:27] God is not ashamed
[49:29] [Applause]
[49:30] so I on that on that service I actually
[49:35] say I don't know
[49:37] who I'm talking to
[49:39] but I'm very sure this is for somebody
[49:42] I said God will not will not stop
[49:45] them to falsely accuse you they'll
[49:48] falsely accuse you and God will not stop
[49:51] for the meeting for you to be called
[49:53] you will be called for that meeting and
[49:56] I said God will allow you to be sitting
[49:59] on that table and they'll be sitting
[50:02] there with your verdict but right at
[50:05] that moment
[50:06] God is not ashamed because he wants to
[50:10] see your attitude
[50:12] as you're going through the trial
[50:14] and if you are here and you have the
[50:16] same situation
[50:17] like the preacher said on Wednesday we
[50:21] do not negotiate
[50:22] with terrorists can you say Amen we do
[50:27] not negotiate with devils
[50:31] okay
[50:33] I'm not preaching
[50:35] let's stand up on office
[50:37] and
[50:41] it's a blessed Sunday
[50:44] we have got Pastor Talent
[50:48] from Days of the voice Fellowship in
[50:51] Uganda
[50:52] uh
[50:53] very wonderful men of God
[50:56] I spent yesterday the whole day with him
[51:00] fellowshipping
[51:02] I really loved him
[51:04] it's love at first sight
[51:07] and you know when we were talking he
[51:09] started reminding me of the number of
[51:12] people that I know and he knows and we
[51:15] are connected to these people and it's
[51:17] just amazing that the trip that I went
[51:20] to Ireland to preach at the youth
[51:24] meeting when I got there Pastor Marais
[51:27] told me there's a young brother that was
[51:30] supposed to come and preach
[51:32] these meetings and he was supposed to
[51:36] come from Uganda but unfortunately he's
[51:39] not making it
[51:40] and then I only learned that it was
[51:42] actually him so we were supposed to have
[51:45] met a long time ago
[51:47] but I believe we met before even the
[51:49] issue of Ireland
[51:51] we met before the foundations of the
[51:53] world
[51:54] it's a very seasoned man of God you know
[51:58] in the fellowship you can contact the
[52:00] spirit of a man the maturity in which he
[52:03] you know Converses and handles the
[52:06] scripture it's amazing what God has done
[52:09] through his ministry he established two
[52:12] assemblies in Ethiopia
[52:16] and is Ugandan
[52:18] then after that he then moved down to
[52:21] Uganda where he's established the
[52:23] fellowship which is pastoring right now
[52:25] and I believe it's just the beginning of
[52:27] what God is doing in his life
[52:29] we want him to know that we appreciate
[52:31] him
[52:32] and we want to draw as much as we can
[52:35] from the gift of God by amening the word
[52:39] and you know usually I know after the
[52:42] service the anointing will be just too
[52:44] much and we won't be able to make
[52:46] comments but if he leaves
[52:49] please he must take our greetings with
[52:51] to Uganda tell them we appreciate you
[52:55] God has got a witness in South Africa
[52:58] and we are so great glad that God has
[53:02] got a witness in Uganda brother blessed
[53:07] has been his friend you know they've
[53:10] been driving up and down together taking
[53:13] him to the hotel and we appreciate you
[53:15] so much brother blessed you know he's
[53:19] doing a good job
[53:20] when I see these young brothers that are
[53:24] married doing the right thing I am happy
[53:27] because we know that uh
[53:30] you know we've got a replacement for
[53:33] deacons and trustees by the grace of God
[53:36] when they are aging we have got a new
[53:39] crop that is coming in and the future is
[53:42] secured
[53:43] amen so while we're in there you sing a
[53:46] song that he actually wanted to sing so
[53:49] maybe if you start it then you finish it
[53:51] off there is a rest I must run

[1:01:13] Pastor side ministered for

[1:01:46] all planned by God way back before the

[1:01:52] this morning
[1:01:54] shall We Stand and read the word

[1:02:05] amen the service
[1:02:07] the way it has been going the song
[1:02:09] leader the songs he has sung the
[1:02:11] testimonies that we have had it's all
[1:02:13] been a preamble of what we are going to
[1:02:14] talk about
[1:02:15] and what I'm going to speak to you on
[1:02:17] this morning is when the devil thought
[1:02:20] he had won and so brother I don't know
[1:02:25] your names but when the devil thought he
[1:02:26] had won
[1:02:27] Hallelujah then actually he realized he
[1:02:30] had lost
[1:02:32] praise the Lord let us take our Bibles
[1:02:34] through the Book of Genesis chapter 3
[1:02:35] verse 1.
[1:02:54] now the serpent was most subtle than any
[1:02:58] beast of the field which the Lord God
[1:03:00] had made
[1:03:03] and he said unto the woman yeah has God
[1:03:05] said ye shall not eat of every tree of
[1:03:08] the garden
[1:03:10] and a woman said unto the serpent we may
[1:03:13] eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[1:03:15] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:03:18] which is in the Middle East of the
[1:03:21] garden God has said You shall not eat of
[1:03:24] it neither shall he touch it lest he
[1:03:27] died
[1:03:28] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[1:03:31] shall not surely die
[1:03:33] for God has forgot that know that in the
[1:03:36] day he eat thereof then your eyes shall
[1:03:39] be opened and he shall be as Gods
[1:03:41] knowing Good and Evil
[1:03:42] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:03:45] good for food and that it was pleasant
[1:03:47] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:03:50] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:03:52] thereof and did it and gave also unto
[1:03:55] her husband with her and he did it and
[1:03:59] the eyes of them both were opened and
[1:04:01] they knew that they had that they were
[1:04:03] naked and they sold fig leaves together
[1:04:06] and made themselves aprons
[1:04:10] shall we speak to the Lord for just a
[1:04:12] moment Lord Jesus we have read a portion
[1:04:15] of your word once again
[1:04:17] no doubt in this church and being
[1:04:21] Believers of this message this is a
[1:04:22] portion where we have read many many
[1:04:24] times but father we are asking you oh
[1:04:27] God one more time to just come and give
[1:04:29] us inspiration Lord let your spirit oh
[1:04:32] God come and overtake us that we will
[1:04:34] speak only what you want us to speak
[1:04:36] this morning come and overtake me
[1:04:38] overtake the people and let us all be in
[1:04:40] one channel where we shall hear from you
[1:04:42] this morning in the precious name of
[1:04:44] Jesus Christ amen be seated please
[1:04:47] so no doubt you have a wonderful Pastor
[1:04:50] a wonderful man of God a wonderful
[1:04:52] preacher so I can never preach close to
[1:04:54] how we can preach but this morning I I
[1:04:58] want you to know that we are all
[1:05:00] different and we are all special before
[1:05:01] the Lord just like you're all different
[1:05:03] from one another balam said that God has
[1:05:05] a flower garden and you see if God had
[1:05:08] all you know the flowers red it would be
[1:05:11] redundant and do not look nice if all of
[1:05:13] them were white or if all of them were
[1:05:15] black but God made sure that he is a god
[1:05:17] of variety he puts black red yellow you
[1:05:19] know white and then it's a flower garden
[1:05:21] and it looks beautiful so
[1:05:24] um you know God called him and he has a
[1:05:27] powerful Ministry we all want to sit
[1:05:28] under it and listen but this morning the
[1:05:31] Lord has fallen on me to speak to you so
[1:05:32] bear with me and let us see what the
[1:05:34] Lord will have for us this morning
[1:05:36] amen now when the devil thought he had
[1:05:39] won of course my theme is a generation
[1:05:40] of Overcomers
[1:05:42] and here we
[1:05:46] we start out here in Genesis and this
[1:05:49] story is very common to us this was one
[1:05:51] of the teachings that excited me when I
[1:05:54] first came to the message when I really
[1:05:56] knew that the church actually had many
[1:05:59] things that they did not understand many
[1:06:02] things that we can only understand when
[1:06:04] we believe the message of the hour there
[1:06:06] are many things that they teach out
[1:06:07] there in a perverted way you know in a
[1:06:09] confused way but there are certain
[1:06:11] things that you can actually even never
[1:06:13] be able to understand even they can't
[1:06:15] even try to come close unless they are
[1:06:17] actually exposed to this message of the
[1:06:19] hour and this is one of those teachings
[1:06:21] and I've had some people trying to
[1:06:22] downplay the teaching on the serpent
[1:06:24] seed and and you know we don't need it
[1:06:26] it's not important but let me tell you
[1:06:28] the teaching on the serpentine actually
[1:06:29] opens and unlocks the whole Bible and
[1:06:32] the whole Plan of Redemption and the
[1:06:34] whole reason why God had to come down in
[1:06:36] the form of man and die for us on the
[1:06:37] cross so here we see that the serpent
[1:06:40] was more subtle than any beast of the
[1:06:42] field which the Lord God had made and he
[1:06:44] said unto the woman has God said ye
[1:06:47] shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:06:49] garden and of course we know that the
[1:06:51] serpent did not begin in the garden as
[1:06:52] we progress we'll be able to see where
[1:06:54] he started but God gives the word to man
[1:06:57] and indeed God gave the word to man when
[1:06:59] he created man in his own image man had
[1:07:02] the word and so man kept the word and he
[1:07:04] knew that there were many trees in the
[1:07:06] garden of course I always tell people
[1:07:08] that there were three categories of
[1:07:10] trees there were the trees like the uh
[1:07:13] the mango trees the uh you know these
[1:07:16] other trees that you know are good for
[1:07:17] food and you know physical food and that
[1:07:19] that was one category but there were
[1:07:22] other two categories of trees that were
[1:07:25] in the middle of the garden and the
[1:07:27] Bible says one of them was the tree of
[1:07:30] knowledge of Good and Evil and another
[1:07:31] one was the tree of life now but the
[1:07:34] manam said in the church edge book that
[1:07:36] Jesus Christ is the tree of life
[1:07:38] actually he was the man of life because
[1:07:40] he came actually there's no other man
[1:07:43] that came and spoke like Jesus spoke
[1:07:45] when Jesus came and said I am the way I
[1:07:49] am the truth I am the life so Jesus was
[1:07:52] literally declaring to the people that I
[1:07:55] am the Tree of Life I am the man of life
[1:07:58] and by the bottom said if Jesus was the
[1:08:01] man of life if the if the tree of life
[1:08:03] was a man was a person then that means
[1:08:06] also the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:08:08] Evil is also something else it's just
[1:08:10] figurative it's a figurative language
[1:08:12] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:08:14] Evil was Saturn was the devil who came
[1:08:18] down to the Garden of Eden to deceive
[1:08:20] now God had given man the word and he
[1:08:23] told him you can eat of every other tree
[1:08:24] but he told him but of the tree of
[1:08:27] knowledge of Good and Evil this one you
[1:08:29] shall not eat of it so man passed down
[1:08:31] now who had the word man and then Man
[1:08:34] passed the word down to his wife
[1:08:37] so now the wife also had the word and
[1:08:40] she believed the word and you know it
[1:08:42] was one church it was one family of
[1:08:44] Believers but here the serpent came to
[1:08:46] the woman you know and then beguiled her
[1:08:49] you know the you know maybe uh Adam was
[1:08:53] somewhere in the garden doing his uh his
[1:08:56] normal work that he used to do and and
[1:08:58] you know the devil was like the Bible
[1:09:00] says he knew when and how to meet what
[1:09:04] he wanted the devil whatever he was
[1:09:06] doing whatever actually the devil does
[1:09:08] is on purpose
[1:09:10] and so he came to Eve because Eve had
[1:09:13] the facility that he needed in order to
[1:09:16] accomplish his vision
[1:09:18] and so he came to the woman and beguiled
[1:09:21] her and the woman you know gave in and
[1:09:23] when she accepted to eat of this tree of
[1:09:25] course we know how she was able to be
[1:09:27] overtaken because she added on the word
[1:09:29] and when you add on the word then the
[1:09:32] devil is able to take off of the word
[1:09:34] and then he's able to add afflictions on
[1:09:37] your life and of course you are on the
[1:09:38] ground of the devil and now here we see
[1:09:41] that when she accepted to each of these
[1:09:43] three when she accepted to
[1:09:46] the moment the devil thought he had won
[1:09:50] actually the devil thought he had won
[1:09:53] now the victory of the devil is always
[1:09:55] the stepping stone of God is great works
[1:09:57] Brothers these two brothers can be able
[1:09:59] to tell that when a devil thinks he has
[1:10:01] Victory that's actually when God I want
[1:10:05] to say this is the beginning the victory
[1:10:07] of the devil is always the stepping
[1:10:08] stone of God of God is great works to
[1:10:10] him this was the end of the beginning
[1:10:13] but to God this was just the beginning
[1:10:16] of the end did you hear what I said
[1:10:19] to the devil Hallelujah he thought well
[1:10:22] now I let me go down and confuse the
[1:10:25] creation of God let me go down and
[1:10:28] confuse the domain of man that God had
[1:10:31] pressed on Earth and he thought this is
[1:10:33] going to be the end of everything that
[1:10:36] God had envisioned but actually to God
[1:10:38] Amen God knows all things God knows your
[1:10:42] life even God knows what you do not know
[1:10:44] when you thought you were failing that's
[1:10:46] when God was saying that things are
[1:10:48] starting to work out in your life
[1:10:50] you see to the devil this was the end of
[1:10:53] the beginning but to God this was just
[1:10:55] the beginning of the end things were
[1:10:58] just beginning to the devil things were
[1:11:01] ending but to God things were just
[1:11:03] beginning
[1:11:05] and you know the battle actually started
[1:11:07] in heaven in Revelation chapter 12 verse
[1:11:09] 7 he says and there was war in heaven
[1:11:12] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:11:15] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:11:18] angels and prevailed not neither was
[1:11:21] their place found any more in heaven and
[1:11:24] the Great Dragon was cast out
[1:11:26] did you hear that phrase cast out
[1:11:29] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:11:32] Saturn which deceiveth the whole world
[1:11:34] he was cast out into the Earth and his
[1:11:37] angels were cast out with him now this
[1:11:40] battle was the Battle of angels this
[1:11:43] battle started in heaven and it was
[1:11:44] raging in heaven but this battle I want
[1:11:47] to say the Battle of angels became the
[1:11:50] Battle of man
[1:11:52] that this battle is still raging today
[1:11:53] this battle is between two great forces
[1:11:57] you see Lucifer thought that he will
[1:12:00] um
[1:12:01] I'll say it in a way in the words about
[1:12:03] the banham when he talks about the two
[1:12:05] word forces the message the greatest
[1:12:06] battle ever thought he says now that's
[1:12:08] the two great forces that's coming
[1:12:09] together right now
[1:12:11] they are battling
[1:12:13] they are battling right here in the
[1:12:15] building right now right now even right
[1:12:18] now did you know just now even when
[1:12:20] you're in church right now the battle
[1:12:22] actually goes on you see it says they
[1:12:25] battled day by day with you every Force
[1:12:28] there are two forces you know as you go
[1:12:30] on at your place of work as you go on to
[1:12:32] run your daily errands or when you're at
[1:12:34] home or when you're at work or if you're
[1:12:36] a student and you are at school actually
[1:12:37] this battle continues raging on in your
[1:12:40] life in your mind you might not realize
[1:12:42] that something is going on but we are
[1:12:44] actually walking between two great
[1:12:46] forces and we are battling Within These
[1:12:48] two great force but the badam says we
[1:12:50] battle day by day and this you know
[1:12:53] these two great forces start and
[1:12:54] following you along that great big
[1:12:57] kingly priest Goliath trying to scare
[1:12:59] the liver out of you how many have been
[1:13:01] scared before
[1:13:03] and you went through something and you
[1:13:05] thought that you will not be able to
[1:13:06] sail through or you not be able to
[1:13:08] overcome and have found many people many
[1:13:11] times who feel oh how can I overcome you
[1:13:14] know how can I receive the Holy Ghost
[1:13:16] how can I keep you know defeating the
[1:13:18] enemy how can I keep Victory and I do
[1:13:21] not know how to keep the victory because
[1:13:22] you know they are tempted and they
[1:13:24] backslide they attempted and many of
[1:13:26] them their greatest fear is to fear
[1:13:28] backsliding
[1:13:30] fear backsliding and others fear hell
[1:13:33] let me tell you as a believer of this
[1:13:35] message you should never fear hell
[1:13:37] did you know that hell is not a portion
[1:13:39] of Believers our goddess fear right now
[1:13:41] is not hell because hell is not my
[1:13:44] portion I do not believe this message to
[1:13:46] go to hell let others fear hell but as
[1:13:49] as far as I'm concerned I am here to
[1:13:53] overcome I was born on purpose God has a
[1:13:56] purpose for my life and as I'm speaking
[1:13:58] to you I'm actually speaking to myself
[1:14:01] God has a purpose when he called you he
[1:14:04] called you with a purpose and that
[1:14:06] purpose was not good to go to hell but
[1:14:08] that purpose was actually to go in the
[1:14:10] rapture
[1:14:11] the bride whatever you are you are
[1:14:13] thinking about the Rapture even when you
[1:14:15] are down in the valley you are thinking
[1:14:17] about the Rapture even when you're going
[1:14:19] through a trial you are thinking about
[1:14:21] the rapture
[1:14:23] I cannot fear you know that our
[1:14:25] backslide no you know the Bible I think
[1:14:28] in the book of Mikhail he says Rejoice
[1:14:30] not against me or my enemy when I fall
[1:14:32] down I shall arise when I sit in
[1:14:35] darkness the Lord will be a light unto
[1:14:37] me why why because as a Believer
[1:14:40] whenever you are you are in the hands of
[1:14:42] God
[1:14:44] Jesus Christ said father all that you
[1:14:46] have given me I in my hands and no one
[1:14:49] can black them out
[1:14:54] let me tell you predestination is
[1:14:55] greater than we thought it is we are in
[1:14:58] God's hands and we are walking
[1:14:59] Hallelujah in the past which he has
[1:15:01] favored for us before time
[1:15:04] Hallelujah and you know the devil has
[1:15:07] that greatly great Goliath he tries to
[1:15:10] come and scare the river but the balance
[1:15:12] says they will leave out of you and then
[1:15:15] he says he's right
[1:15:17] and then he says but God
[1:15:22] tell your neighbor but God
[1:15:25] he says you are fortified
[1:15:29] Hallelujah if you believe what I'm
[1:15:30] saying just say Amen

[1:20:51] [Applause]
[1:20:53] if he starts to stick his head in there
[1:20:55] what
[1:20:56] Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:00] I want you to turn with me to the Book
[1:21:01] of Ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13. and see
[1:21:04] what he says down there
[1:21:06] about this Saturn
[1:21:08] that we are speaking of
[1:21:11] thou has been verse 13.
[1:21:13] in Aiden The Garden of God
[1:21:18] excuse me and every preacher's Stone
[1:21:21] was thy covering
[1:21:23] the satyas topaz and the diamond the
[1:21:28] burial the Orcs The Jasper they suffer
[1:21:32] they aim around and the kabank on gold
[1:21:36] the workmanship of the tablets of thy
[1:21:39] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[1:21:42] that thou was created now here he's
[1:21:48] speaking of it began by saying that you
[1:21:51] were in Eden the Garden of God
[1:21:54] so whoever is talking about is somebody
[1:21:56] who was in Eden all right but then also
[1:21:59] as the future verse 13 he says he was
[1:22:02] created so this is a creature now though
[1:22:06] at thou at the anointed cherub that
[1:22:08] covereth and I have said this so now
[1:22:09] here also on also in addition he is a
[1:22:13] Carib he's an angel
[1:22:16] thou was upon the holy mountain of God
[1:22:18] thou has walked down up and down in the
[1:22:20] midst of the stones of fire praise the
[1:22:22] name of the Lord now Satan was created
[1:22:27] how many believe that
[1:22:29] Saturn is a creature of God but Satan
[1:22:32] was walking up and down the stones of
[1:22:34] fire in heaven upon the holy mountain of
[1:22:37] God
[1:22:38] amen Saturn said that he wanted to you
[1:22:41] know lift himself up above the stars of
[1:22:43] God he wanted to make another kingdom
[1:22:46] greater than what Michael had Hallelujah
[1:22:48] and of course we know that Michael is
[1:22:50] there is the Angelic uh is is there is
[1:22:54] there Michael is what I would say the
[1:22:57] manifestation of Christ in the Angelic
[1:23:00] realm and and you see that Michael had a
[1:23:03] great Kingdom and Lucifer wanted to
[1:23:05] overtake that Kingdom so he can have a
[1:23:07] greater Kingdom
[1:23:09] and then we see that as we read here in
[1:23:12] the book of or did we read that in the
[1:23:14] Book of Revelation I think we did not
[1:23:15] read it praise the name of the Lord yeah
[1:23:17] yeah we did read it in the Book of
[1:23:18] Revelation chapter 12. he says that you
[1:23:20] see there was way in heaven Michael and
[1:23:23] his angels fought against the dragon oh
[1:23:26] my and the dragon fought and his angels
[1:23:28] and prevailed not neither was their
[1:23:30] place found any more in heaven and so
[1:23:32] that great Dragon was cast out
[1:23:35] hey man that's right by the banana says
[1:23:37] that's what believers do amen God that's
[1:23:39] his formula he casts house demons he
[1:23:42] casts out spirits in the same way he
[1:23:44] cast out that demon that's something
[1:23:46] that old serpent called the devil Saturn
[1:23:48] which deceives the whole world
[1:23:51] and he was cast down to the Earth and
[1:23:53] his angels were cast out with him and
[1:23:56] now when you come down here he says he
[1:23:59] was an angel he was in heaven he was
[1:24:01] great until iniquity actually was
[1:24:04] perfect
[1:24:04] until iniquity was found in him
[1:24:08] did you see the tree of knowledge of
[1:24:09] Good and Evil
[1:24:11] he had knowledge but he also had good
[1:24:14] and evil but the Bible says he was
[1:24:17] perfect until iniquity was found in him
[1:24:20] so he he he had Perfection he had a good
[1:24:23] but also iniquity was in there so the
[1:24:25] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is
[1:24:27] certain
[1:24:28] Hallelujah and when God said don't eat
[1:24:30] of it he meant do not listen
[1:24:34] what are we doing right now we are
[1:24:35] eating we are eating the word we are
[1:24:38] eating the bread of life and Jesus amen
[1:24:40] wants us to keep eating eating he told
[1:24:43] the disciples if you don't eat amen My
[1:24:46] Flesh and you don't break my blood you
[1:24:48] are not a part of me Hallelujah Jesus
[1:24:51] wants us to eat the Tree of Life
[1:25:01] amen
[1:25:06] they don't have access to the Tree of
[1:25:09] Life
[1:25:09] the rest of the world doesn't have
[1:25:11] access to the tree of life but he that
[1:25:15] will overcome in our generation
[1:25:16] Hallelujah I want to say this message is
[1:25:18] the is the axis to the Tree of Life
[1:25:22] Hallelujah now when you receive this
[1:25:25] message and believe it amen and sit
[1:25:26] under the word what are you doing you
[1:25:29] are eating of the Tree of Life
[1:25:31] that is why the Bible says amen we have
[1:25:34] already passed from death and to life
[1:25:37] did you know you can only die once and
[1:25:40] you die the moment you accepted to die
[1:25:42] to yourself you are accepted to be born
[1:25:44] again of what of The Incorruptible word
[1:25:47] The Incorruptible seed of God you can
[1:25:50] never die again
[1:25:53] Hallelujah and then he said there is
[1:25:55] there a for now no condemnation to them
[1:25:58] that are in Christ Jesus who work not
[1:26:00] after the flesh but walk after the
[1:26:03] spirit
[1:26:03] Hallelujah I want to tell you this that
[1:26:07] the believer will never never there is
[1:26:09] no time they believe I will never walk
[1:26:12] before the Judgment thrown
[1:26:16] is that hard for you do you believe that
[1:26:19] I will never walk before the white
[1:26:21] Throne judgment to be judged according
[1:26:23] to my works because the Bible has said
[1:26:25] now now there is therefore now no
[1:26:29] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:26:33] so you see I am not because of this
[1:26:36] message I am not worried about hell
[1:26:38] because of this message I am not worried
[1:26:40] about death because of this message I am
[1:26:43] not even worried about the day of
[1:26:44] judgment why because all of it has
[1:26:47] happened for me here on Earth I have
[1:26:50] died on Earth I've been judged on Earth
[1:26:52] Hallelujah and the Bible says I died
[1:26:54] amen and now I'm born again of The
[1:26:57] Incorruptible seed
[1:27:00] so the only thing I'm waiting for is my
[1:27:03] victory is my reward with Jesus Christ
[1:27:06] is coming with
[1:27:09] me yes there will be there will be uh
[1:27:13] the Judgment seat of Christ but that is
[1:27:15] not the white Throne judgment for the
[1:27:17] believer and see friends
[1:27:19] then here we see that
[1:27:22] the anointed he was anointed he was
[1:27:25] created and sudden by perverting
[1:27:28] and be guiding the woman to eat of the
[1:27:31] tree he thought that he had won
[1:27:36] I imagine when the devil was cast out of
[1:27:38] heaven and then he came down on the on
[1:27:40] the Earth
[1:27:41] and he had devised a plan you know when
[1:27:46] you're attacking a fortified Kingdom
[1:27:47] because brother said we are fortified if
[1:27:50] you are attacking a fortified Kingdom
[1:27:52] you have to be intelligent and you have
[1:27:53] to know the act of War
[1:27:55] so when Saturn came he he really I love
[1:27:59] this message he really had he thought he
[1:28:02] had the Art of War you know he tried to
[1:28:04] fast take over the Kingdom in Heaven and
[1:28:05] he failed terribly he felt terribly I
[1:28:08] believe even in heaven when he took his
[1:28:11] throne and he sat and he was like yeah
[1:28:13] now I'm going to you know the attack and
[1:28:15] three quarters of heaven and he was like
[1:28:16] oh yeah now I've I've arrived I've taken
[1:28:19] over God now then soon enough hey hey
[1:28:22] hey hey Hallelujah the one I thought yes
[1:28:25] I have overtaken actually is now
[1:28:27] overtaking me and the Bible says he was
[1:28:29] thrown down to the ass
[1:28:31] yeah
[1:28:32] he came o my good lord the devil came to
[1:28:35] the eyes as a loser
[1:28:37] now what tells you that he can win in
[1:28:39] your life he can never win in my life
[1:28:42] because he's a loser to begin with the
[1:28:45] reason why the devil is in hell is
[1:28:47] because he's a loser
[1:28:50] Hallelujah and he thought he had won in
[1:28:52] heaven and then he realized he lost it
[1:28:54] and then and then all of a sudden when
[1:28:56] he came down here on the earth he had he
[1:28:59] had to strategize so he told his little
[1:29:01] demons of course they were angels to
[1:29:02] begin with but now they have become
[1:29:03] demons so he told his little demons now
[1:29:06] let us strategize
[1:29:08] so he began you know sending one I don't
[1:29:10] know the the names of the Demons because
[1:29:13] you know but I know a few Angels so now
[1:29:16] here those demons I don't know maybe you
[1:29:18] know you can you think of any so he
[1:29:20] began called one by one now you take
[1:29:22] that one you got the other side you got
[1:29:25] the other side and as for me I have a
[1:29:27] plan don't worry so he looked at that
[1:29:30] Beast like creature that Beast which
[1:29:32] looked like almost like a man and
[1:29:35] brother said it had a place for a soul
[1:29:37] but it never had a soul that's the only
[1:29:40] difference that Beast had with us
[1:29:43] otherwise it was almost like us it could
[1:29:46] talk it could think it could and the
[1:29:48] devil saw that faculty that it had and
[1:29:51] and even said you see it it is sperm his
[1:29:54] seed could mingle with that of a of
[1:29:56] mankind and actually create a baby
[1:30:00] and the devil knew that so he was like
[1:30:02] okay now for me I know what to do
[1:30:05] he did what he did in the terms of
[1:30:07] gadara you know this was a creature we
[1:30:10] as human beings we were created with as
[1:30:12] free moral agents we are free more
[1:30:14] agents but that creature I don't think
[1:30:16] it was because he did have a soul so as
[1:30:19] it was just there in the garden he
[1:30:21] immediately
[1:30:25] what's happening so it began working
[1:30:29] as a vampire going into Eve did the
[1:30:33] goddess say we should not eat now now
[1:30:37] the the religious world the religious
[1:30:40] world now you see why why the message is
[1:30:43] true
[1:30:44] because what the religions are telling
[1:30:46] us cannot add up
[1:30:48] it had to be this
[1:30:51] and you see they put pictures up with a
[1:30:54] snack coil on a tree speaking to if that
[1:30:57] is alive from the Devil Himself
[1:31:00] Hallelujah the devil is trying to hide
[1:31:03] his Beginnings so that he doesn't arrive
[1:31:05] at his end but let me tell you when the
[1:31:07] devil thinks he has won amen that's when
[1:31:09] God comes down and raises a standard
[1:31:12] against the enemy
[1:31:14] Hallelujah and so right there at that
[1:31:17] moment he began to speak to Eve and Eve
[1:31:20] was shocked yeah he always knew that
[1:31:22] this serpent was was intelligent but
[1:31:25] today it was different he was speaking
[1:31:28] words that were confusing
[1:31:30] so he was like okay since I know this
[1:31:34] happened you know I wanted to
[1:31:35] differentiate The Serpent and the devil
[1:31:38] now see some people confuse that here
[1:31:42] was Mr serpent a beast like a creature
[1:31:46] with four is it for limbs right two
[1:31:49] hands two legs it was not crawling it
[1:31:51] was walking
[1:31:53] with it's to fit it had a mouth like
[1:31:56] yours it had a body almost 100 99
[1:31:59] percent like yours
[1:32:01] and a mind even sharper than some of the
[1:32:04] human beings today
[1:32:05] and so and so as it came and you know
[1:32:09] was walking and talking to Eve the Bible
[1:32:11] says Eve was beguiled
[1:32:14] now to be guile you know that this is a
[1:32:18] um in in a in a an immoral way and Eve
[1:32:22] was overtaken and Eve was excited at the
[1:32:25] words that the serpent was telling her
[1:32:28] but you see what was the sin people ask
[1:32:30] me what was the original sin what was
[1:32:32] the sin that was done you see the sin
[1:32:34] that was done is the sin that many
[1:32:36] people are doing today it is unbelief of
[1:32:38] the truth
[1:32:40] the moment that Eve had what the devil
[1:32:43] was saying that very moment she had to
[1:32:45] say no I don't believe it period I
[1:32:48] believe what my husband told me that God
[1:32:50] said and that set us it
[1:32:53] but the moment Eve considered and
[1:32:55] negotiated with the devil that very
[1:32:58] moment she sinned before God and that is
[1:33:02] your original sin
[1:33:04] and when she sinned when she and
[1:33:06] believed the word from that very moment
[1:33:09] then other things began to creep in
[1:33:12] that's when she realized the other
[1:33:14] things you know when somebody believes
[1:33:16] the word and it goes we have seen them
[1:33:17] they say well why the reason why I left
[1:33:20] the message the moment I believe the
[1:33:22] word they go out there you begin to see
[1:33:24] them on beaches with shorts there were
[1:33:27] men saying they are spiritual but now
[1:33:28] they are on shorts showing all their
[1:33:30] hairs and the women are in in bikinis
[1:33:33] and they say they're putting makeup
[1:33:35] they're saying oh we were in prison ah
[1:33:38] so why did they say they begin to go to
[1:33:40] adultery fornication and drinking so
[1:33:42] these are not sins these are all fruits
[1:33:45] of sin sin is unbelief so now the Bible
[1:33:48] says that eve took what took of the
[1:33:52] fruit of the tree
[1:33:54] and that was adultery Hallelujah the
[1:33:57] Bible says hallelujah so is the way of
[1:34:00] another woman what does she do she eats
[1:34:04] and wipes her mouth and says I've done
[1:34:06] no evil hey that's what if did amen and
[1:34:10] when evil amen went on with the serpent
[1:34:13] and then she came back to her husband
[1:34:15] and said look here darling I found
[1:34:18] something wonderful and then Adam said
[1:34:20] oh yeah oh really tell me about it and
[1:34:22] then the Bible says finally after Adam
[1:34:24] was told about it he also did it with
[1:34:28] how
[1:34:29] praising him of the Lord so it was an
[1:34:31] action done right there but I want you
[1:34:33] to see when the devil had
[1:34:36] excuse me when the devil
[1:34:38] had injected his seed into the human
[1:34:41] race
[1:34:42] he thought he had won
[1:34:45] Hallelujah he thought he had won because
[1:34:48] he thought you know he had made a very
[1:34:50] good strategy on how he was going to
[1:34:52] come in on how he was going to you know
[1:34:54] go around and try you know you know the
[1:34:56] devil does that too even today
[1:34:59] he comes in you know you know what
[1:35:01] brother I'm saying he said and you here
[1:35:04] in benoni are really a wonderful sweet
[1:35:06] group of people I have enjoyed to be
[1:35:08] with you
[1:35:10] but then
[1:35:12] would say you know you're now one one
[1:35:15] big great sweet group
[1:35:17] but the devil can bring in somebody
[1:35:20] and then he comes and he shoots him with
[1:35:22] some poison stuff and he begins to go
[1:35:23] around you know begins to go around he
[1:35:25] says but you see when you see that man
[1:35:26] or that woman love them and how pray for
[1:35:29] them that God will change them and and
[1:35:31] if they are not changed then of course
[1:35:33] they will be put away from among us but
[1:35:35] you see I believe I always say the other
[1:35:38] part is good of putting away but I
[1:35:40] always believe that this word this
[1:35:42] message has power to change
[1:35:45] how many believe that that's why we must
[1:35:48] have love one for the other even when
[1:35:50] you feel that someone is not spiritual
[1:35:51] love them brother love them sister God
[1:35:54] is able to change them this message is
[1:35:57] power
[1:35:59] and so then when the enemy came in like
[1:36:02] that and he was like
[1:36:05] he was now within the womb of Eve in our
[1:36:10] language we say okulata you know when
[1:36:13] somebody does something and he he has
[1:36:15] really scored with flying colors he even
[1:36:17] sits and he begins to shake his leg
[1:36:21] that's I believe that's what the devil
[1:36:22] did he began to okay
[1:36:34] come on sing for me because you know
[1:36:36] these were great singers great singers
[1:36:38] so you see it sing for me but you know
[1:36:40] they were great singers but actually our
[1:36:42] God is the one who anointed them to sing
[1:36:44] so he can anoint us to sing better than
[1:36:45] them I believe that so you see where
[1:36:48] they were there and and they were they
[1:36:49] were like oh yeah we have really oh yeah
[1:36:51] oh what did you do oh I went and did
[1:36:53] this and then I met Adam busy the other
[1:36:54] side oh yeah you did well what about you
[1:36:56] oh yeah I was sleeping the other gate oh
[1:36:58] yeah what about you and then the devil
[1:36:59] now gave his testimony as for me hey I
[1:37:03] have finished the mankind I've finished
[1:37:05] the human race nowhere this was just so
[1:37:09] easy actually it was easier than I
[1:37:11] thought
[1:37:12] and then the demons told them come on
[1:37:14] come on give you the testimony and then
[1:37:16] he began say you do you know what I did
[1:37:18] the very life of Adam the very flesh of
[1:37:21] his flesh the very part of him the very
[1:37:23] part of his bones now actually She's
[1:37:26] Mine
[1:37:28] She's mine I have taken her over and do
[1:37:31] you know
[1:37:34] we have taken over the world and they
[1:37:36] began rejoicing they began shouting they
[1:37:38] began dancing they began you know but
[1:37:40] they did not know that at that moment as
[1:37:42] they thought they are the one it was
[1:37:45] just the beginning for God hallelujah
[1:37:49] God was just fixing to do something
[1:37:52] right there
[1:37:54] and I believe you know some people say
[1:37:56] some people who became artists actually
[1:37:58] they begin to say right there they say
[1:38:00] aha so who created the devil they said
[1:38:03] God okay now when God was seeing this
[1:38:06] happening why didn't he stop the devil
[1:38:09] and then they begin to make some people
[1:38:11] doubt but either way why didn't God stop
[1:38:14] the devil
[1:38:15] he could have stopped him but he didn't
[1:38:16] want to stop him because he was just
[1:38:18] fixing to begin
[1:38:20] the music was just starting Brothers the
[1:38:22] music was just starting do you know how
[1:38:25] bad it is if the music is just starting
[1:38:26] and you're just getting into the hype of
[1:38:28] the music and then just and then power
[1:38:30] goes off Lord shedding
[1:38:33] so what is that now you see so God did
[1:38:36] not want to Lord said
[1:38:38] he said the music is just starting come
[1:38:40] on play on play on I'm fixing to do
[1:38:44] something Hallelujah the high octave is
[1:38:47] coming up I'm fixing to do something and
[1:38:49] all the onions were like come on let us
[1:38:51] go and stop him one would let me go and
[1:38:53] just bring water and sweep everything
[1:38:55] said no wait I know I also have a plan
[1:38:59] the devil thought it was the end
[1:39:01] Hallelujah the beginning but God knew it
[1:39:04] was the beginning
[1:39:06] you know the beginning of his end and
[1:39:09] Adam knew here is the other part that I
[1:39:11] really love but the manam says that Adam
[1:39:13] knew what he was doing
[1:39:17] and I will also put it in this maybe for
[1:39:20] somebody who might ever listen to this
[1:39:21] who is not a believer of the message yet
[1:39:22] you see if the serpent was a snake
[1:39:27] why then was their need for God to cast
[1:39:30] it and make it crawl crawl on the ground
[1:39:34] so you see the crowding on the ground
[1:39:35] came later after the cast
[1:39:37] before that it was an upright creature
[1:39:40] and so he lost he lost in the Garden of
[1:39:44] Eden he lost in in heaven he lost in the
[1:39:46] Garden of Eden what makes you think he
[1:39:48] will win now
[1:39:50] you see so he was wrong
[1:39:54] Saturn by perverting or begotten the
[1:39:57] woman to eat of the tree
[1:39:59] he thought he had won but he was wrong
[1:40:01] the woman was a part of a greater
[1:40:03] purpose
[1:40:05] let me let me let me put this in here
[1:40:07] Adam
[1:40:09] was a son of God in the image of God and
[1:40:14] here Eve was a part of Adam now I
[1:40:18] believe
[1:40:20] well Eve did whatever she was doing she
[1:40:23] was counting on Adam
[1:40:25] that's why as soon as Adam arrived she
[1:40:27] was like yes I was counting on you honey
[1:40:28] come I tell you what I've done
[1:40:32] and right there she explained everything
[1:40:35] and
[1:40:36] Adam would have said ah what have you
[1:40:39] done
[1:40:40] do you know the magnitude of what you
[1:40:42] have done you have killed my entire and
[1:40:44] you now it's you has done so you go and
[1:40:46] die you are going to hell now go to hell
[1:40:48] I don't have anything to do with you
[1:40:51] but you see Adam was like okay this is
[1:40:53] what you have done I mean he felt pain
[1:40:55] he felt bad but he was like it's all
[1:40:58] right I know what to do
[1:41:00] I know what you know Adam was in the
[1:41:02] image of God
[1:41:03] he was like God himself it's just like
[1:41:05] God told the angels I know what to do
[1:41:07] next I'm sure Adam told Eve I know what
[1:41:09] to do just leave it for me so I have to
[1:41:11] partake of this if Adam did not do that
[1:41:14] the entire human race would have been
[1:41:16] destroyed
[1:41:17] God would not have made another Eve
[1:41:20] but God had to redeem Adam
[1:41:23] just like Adam had to redeem Eve God had
[1:41:26] to redeemed Adam
[1:41:28] I wanted to I wanted to hear each in the
[1:41:30] world himself
[1:41:34] excuse me now in the message the
[1:41:36] efficient Church age
[1:41:38] um he says now I know in answering one
[1:41:40] question another one is up to come up
[1:41:42] and people ask if Eve fell that way what
[1:41:46] did Adam do
[1:41:47] for God lays the blame on Adam
[1:41:50] and then he says that is simple the word
[1:41:52] of God is forever settled in heaven
[1:41:55] and I want to say also the word of God
[1:41:57] about your life is forever settled in
[1:42:00] heaven
[1:42:01] hey Hallelujah you brother who came up
[1:42:04] I'm selling on your name but you you
[1:42:06] know that when when the pastor was
[1:42:08] preaching and he called you out what do
[1:42:10] you think that was it wasn't the man of
[1:42:12] God was God he had already settled down
[1:42:15] in heaven even before the foundation of
[1:42:17] the world and he wanted you to go
[1:42:18] through what you went through so that
[1:42:20] you can have confidence in God the next
[1:42:22] time
[1:42:24] the word of God is forever settled in
[1:42:26] heaven before one Speck of us of stopped
[1:42:30] us towards man
[1:42:31] don't tell me that this is a seventh
[1:42:33] grade student
[1:42:34] this is more than that this is God
[1:42:36] speaking to us that word God is law was
[1:42:39] there exactly as it was written in our
[1:42:42] Bible
[1:42:43] now the word of God teaches us that if a
[1:42:45] woman leaves her husband and goes with
[1:42:47] another man she is an adulterous and is
[1:42:49] no longer married and the husband is not
[1:42:51] to take her back
[1:42:53] that word was true in Aiden and as it is
[1:42:56] was true when Moses wrote it in the law
[1:42:59] the word can't change tell somebody the
[1:43:02] word can't change
[1:43:03] Adam took her back he knew exactly what
[1:43:07] he was doing but he did it anyway did
[1:43:10] you hear what the prophet said
[1:43:12] let me read it for you again Adam took
[1:43:14] her back he wasn't supposed to do that
[1:43:16] but Adam took her back
[1:43:18] and and then he says he knew exactly
[1:43:21] what he was doing
[1:43:25] but he did it anyway she was a part of
[1:43:27] him and he was willing to take her
[1:43:30] responsibility upon himself
[1:43:33] that's why I tell you you married
[1:43:35] Brothers you must be willing to take the
[1:43:37] responsibility of your wife as a matter
[1:43:39] of fact brother says you see you will
[1:43:41] answer for your wife but your wife will
[1:43:43] not answer for you
[1:43:44] so that is responsibility when you get
[1:43:47] married you receive responsibility you
[1:43:49] have to make sure your wife is right
[1:43:51] with God yes it is your responsibility
[1:43:53] just like mother you have to ensure that
[1:43:55] your children are right with God you see
[1:43:57] it is a hierarchy that God has blessed
[1:43:59] and it's a Palmer it can be changed it's
[1:44:01] the word
[1:44:03] and so Adam you see here when we take
[1:44:06] the vows we say in our language
[1:44:12] is it sounding the same even in your
[1:44:14] language
[1:44:15] how is it spoken in a
[1:44:17] someone tell me one of the South African
[1:44:19] languages
[1:44:26] yeah yes sister what's your language
[1:44:30] okay is it South African
[1:44:33] what is it in your language
[1:44:38] oh that's a bit long for me
[1:44:40] every
[1:44:43] every
[1:44:47] where
[1:44:51] that that's what we say you say I'll be
[1:44:54] with you in good and bad in Good and
[1:44:56] Evil I'll be with you you know when
[1:44:58] you're sick when you're aware I'll be
[1:45:00] with you when you are back or when you
[1:45:01] are poor or when you are rich I'll be
[1:45:03] with you you know that's not that the
[1:45:04] voice will take
[1:45:06] and I want to say here as a husband and
[1:45:09] the wife you must by all means in all
[1:45:11] circumstances keep those vows because it
[1:45:15] is made before the Lord and so we see
[1:45:17] here that Adam was also ready Adam was
[1:45:20] willing to keep his vows Hallelujah when
[1:45:24] she's seen he knew what he was doing but
[1:45:26] he did it anyhow why because he was
[1:45:28] willing to take her responsibility upon
[1:45:31] himself
[1:45:34] he would not let her go
[1:45:36] I'm talking about Adam and Eve but I'm
[1:45:38] seeing something else he would not let
[1:45:40] her go so if conceived by him he knew
[1:45:44] she would he knew exactly what would
[1:45:46] happen to the human race and he saw the
[1:45:48] human race into sin that he might have
[1:45:50] her Eve for he loved
[1:45:57] if you want to have problems with two
[1:45:59] younger people who are in love try to
[1:46:02] separate them
[1:46:03] that's when he was even if you're a
[1:46:05] relative they will forget you that's
[1:46:07] when you will know that these people
[1:46:09] really maybe are meant for each other
[1:46:10] because they are willing to do
[1:46:12] everything on anything but abandon spoke
[1:46:14] of Romeo and Juliet and you see how they
[1:46:16] had this love for one another you know
[1:46:18] he would do anything to to to you know
[1:46:20] because of the love he had for hand she
[1:46:22] the same way so now you see Adam you
[1:46:25] know when he found Eve had sinned Adam
[1:46:29] you know partook of the same thing that
[1:46:31] she had done but it did painfully
[1:46:34] because he knew he was going to plunge
[1:46:36] the whole human race into sin but he he
[1:46:39] knew also by doing what he did he had
[1:46:42] given over the whole human race
[1:46:45] but not without a redeemer there was
[1:46:47] also another Redeemer
[1:46:49] so now you know she had seen and she had
[1:46:52] gone through all that she went through
[1:46:53] but you see when Adam allowed her to to
[1:46:56] go through that time and you know he he
[1:46:58] came and he partook of the same thing
[1:47:00] and come here brother and and so he he
[1:47:03] put his arms around now they were both
[1:47:07] in the same situation
[1:47:10] and brother can you put your arm around
[1:47:12] me
[1:47:12] and and so as they walked they were
[1:47:16] naked at that moment and they walked and
[1:47:19] they walked and Adam was with Eve and
[1:47:22] then they went and hid somewhere in the
[1:47:24] thickets and they made some fig leaves
[1:47:27] and covered themselves with aprons and
[1:47:30] they were there Adam was there with Eve
[1:47:32] says my Eve I'm not going to let you go
[1:47:35] my Eve I love you so much my Eve I'm
[1:47:38] ready to lose it all for you my Eve I'm
[1:47:41] able to do anything even if the devil
[1:47:43] has won this time don't you worry I have
[1:47:45] your back
[1:47:47] let me tell you that was only a type and
[1:47:50] a shadow of what was about to come
[1:47:53] hey Hallelujah just like Eve had a
[1:47:58] redeemer Adam had a redeemer too
[1:48:02] Eve was a born of born flesh of Flesh of
[1:48:05] Adam but Adam was born of birth flesh of
[1:48:08] Flesh of God himself
[1:48:11] Hallelujah
[1:48:13] we are just when the devil thought he
[1:48:15] had won there was somebody else somebody
[1:48:19] else showed up I said somebody else
[1:48:21] showed up in the garden and then he
[1:48:25] heard a voice not calling Eve because he
[1:48:28] had somebody else to call her
[1:48:31] when I've seen it was Adam who showed up
[1:48:34] said if what have you done today can I
[1:48:37] tell you what I've done but in the same
[1:48:38] same way Hallelujah God showed up and he
[1:48:41] said Adam Adam where are they now
[1:48:45] and Adam was there and he said oh I'm
[1:48:49] right here don't worry now he has come
[1:48:51] just like I showed up for you he has
[1:48:53] showed up for me and everything is all
[1:48:55] right
[1:48:56] when the devil thought he had won
[1:49:00] to change
[1:49:01] love is a great thing Adam was willing
[1:49:04] to do anything to save a part of himself
[1:49:06] Hallelujah so Saturn the tree of
[1:49:09] knowledge of Good and Evil goes to the
[1:49:11] to Aiden after he was cast out of Heaven
[1:49:13] as we have seen I came to destroy to
[1:49:15] kill to steal everything in Adam's
[1:49:17] domain
[1:49:19] as I was studying I wrote this by
[1:49:21] inspiration I said
[1:49:23] these were words of Saturn he said if I
[1:49:25] can't take over your domain
[1:49:28] I will take over your son's domain
[1:49:31] this was Saturn speaking to himself
[1:49:34] about God
[1:49:35] if I can't take over your domain
[1:49:38] I'll go and take your son his domain
[1:49:40] sometimes when the devil defeat they
[1:49:42] could not defeat you
[1:49:43] he tries to that same demon which try to
[1:49:46] defeat you in your life and you overcame
[1:49:48] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:49:49] of your testimony he comes down to your
[1:49:51] children
[1:49:52] and to try and torment them but let me
[1:49:54] tell you the same way you overcome those
[1:49:57] children will have to overcome
[1:49:59] Hallelujah one thing that I am so happy
[1:50:02] about is our God does not change the way
[1:50:04] he does things if we meet the same
[1:50:07] conditions that our parents made we will
[1:50:09] receive the same results Saturn did not
[1:50:11] know the sun is a part of the Father the
[1:50:13] father could never let a part of him die
[1:50:15] just just when he had started to think
[1:50:17] he had won like I said when he has
[1:50:20] started to think I think I've won this
[1:50:22] the table has changed
[1:50:25] questions and answers 59 he says
[1:50:27] everything that God does is perfect and
[1:50:30] eternal
[1:50:32] Hallelujah I am fearfully and
[1:50:35] wonderfully made oh I'm perfect at
[1:50:36] eternal
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:39] did you notice he doesn't say when this
[1:50:42] happens and this happens and this
[1:50:43] happened then you are fearful and
[1:50:45] wonderfully made
[1:50:46] now he says you are fearful and one of
[1:50:49] remed even before anything has happened
[1:50:51] he said I loved Jacob and I hated before
[1:50:56] any of them did anything bad oh good oh
[1:50:58] good so there is none of the good that
[1:51:01] we do we must do the good but none of
[1:51:04] the good that we do is going to give us
[1:51:06] victory
[1:51:08] you understand you have to trust in a
[1:51:11] perfect God and this perfect God has
[1:51:14] revealed himself to us in our generation
[1:51:16] through the perfect world
[1:51:18] now if you receive that word and you
[1:51:20] believe it with all that is within you
[1:51:22] then that perfect God will make you
[1:51:24] perfect
[1:51:25] and he says and when God is very
[1:51:26] thoughts went out for a kingdom or
[1:51:28] people who would worship him then the
[1:51:30] results is eternal they can no more
[1:51:33] perish they can no more perish every
[1:51:36] word of God is eternal Jesus said
[1:51:38] heavens and Ash will pass away both
[1:51:41] Heaven and Earth may pass away but my
[1:51:44] words will never pass away they are
[1:51:46] Eternal with God and if he abide in me
[1:51:48] and my word in you we become a part of
[1:51:50] him his word part of his life for we are
[1:51:52] flesh of his flesh and born of his bones
[1:51:54] and life of his life
[1:51:57] then we can no more perish than God
[1:51:58] himself could perish that's why the Holy
[1:52:01] Ghost is listen whatever challenge that
[1:52:03] we as Believers in this relation Church
[1:52:06] age in this last day is going through
[1:52:08] he's not going to consume us
[1:52:12] how many believe we say Amen
[1:52:16] we are not going to be consumed
[1:52:19] Hallelujah
[1:52:20] I just paused a bit because I was
[1:52:22] reflecting on my life and I was like oh
[1:52:24] praise the name of the Living God
[1:52:26] no matter what trick contract the enemy
[1:52:29] laid against you it cannot consume you
[1:52:33] think about your own life
[1:52:35] and The Traps that the enemy has laid
[1:52:37] for you
[1:52:38] and each of them no you want to attack
[1:52:41] you want me to tell you that you went
[1:52:42] through no you went through because you
[1:52:43] were here so you went through you
[1:52:45] overcome
[1:52:48] so why do we hear the word we hear the
[1:52:50] word to remind us of who we are each
[1:52:53] time whenever we come because whatever
[1:52:55] is you are going to use to overcome is
[1:52:57] Right In You
[1:52:58] you see it's in you but you come here to
[1:53:00] be able to be reminded and to be
[1:53:02] inspired so that you can put that word
[1:53:04] to work
[1:53:06] to praise the name of the Living God now
[1:53:08] I want to show you that that same devil
[1:53:10] will continue on and I want to show you
[1:53:12] this through the life of Samson for just
[1:53:14] a moment Now read with me the Book of
[1:53:17] Judges chapter 16 verse 15.
[1:53:20] and she said unto him of course you know
[1:53:22] the story of Samson but we'll just go
[1:53:23] through a little bit he says and she
[1:53:25] said unto him how can thou say I love
[1:53:27] thee when thine heart is not with me
[1:53:29] thou has mocked me these three times and
[1:53:32] has not told me where in thy great
[1:53:34] strength of life and it came to pass
[1:53:37] when she pressed him daily with our
[1:53:40] words and urged him so that his soul was
[1:53:43] vexed unto death that he told her all
[1:53:45] his heart and said unto her there has
[1:53:48] not come a raised upon my head and for I
[1:53:51] have been a Nazareth unto God from my
[1:53:52] mother's womb if I bishop and then my
[1:53:55] strength will go from me and I shall
[1:53:57] become weak and be like any other man
[1:53:59] and when Delilah saw that he had told
[1:54:01] her all his heart she sent and called
[1:54:04] for the Lords of the Philistines saying
[1:54:07] come up these once for he has showed me
[1:54:09] all his heart then the Lords of the
[1:54:11] Philistines came up unto her and brought
[1:54:14] money in their hand
[1:54:15] and she made him sleep upon his knees
[1:54:18] whenever I read this I Marvel
[1:54:21] he's a man a strong man a powerful man a
[1:54:23] man a child of God a man of God but
[1:54:25] listen he is sleeping on the laps of a
[1:54:28] prostitute
[1:54:29] and she made him sleep let does not live
[1:54:31] below our privileges Saints and she made
[1:54:34] him sleep upon her knees and she called
[1:54:36] from a man excuse me and she caused him
[1:54:39] to shave off the Seven Locks of his head
[1:54:41] and she began to afflict him
[1:54:44] and his strength went from him
[1:54:46] and she said the Philistines be upon the
[1:54:49] Samson and they walk out of his sleep
[1:54:51] and said I will go out as the other
[1:54:53] times before and shake myself and he
[1:54:55] wished not that the Lord was departed
[1:54:57] from him
[1:54:58] but the Philistines took him and put his
[1:55:00] eyes and brought him down to Gaza put
[1:55:03] out his eyes and put him to Gaza and
[1:55:04] bound him with fetus of brass and he did
[1:55:07] grind in the prison house how bad their
[1:55:10] hair
[1:55:10] the hair of his head began to grow again
[1:55:12] after he was shaving now Samsung 2 was
[1:55:15] behind the Enemy Lines if you have ever
[1:55:17] been behind the Enemy Lines you know
[1:55:19] what I'm talking about
[1:55:20] how many have ever been behind the Enemy
[1:55:22] Lines
[1:55:23] a few just a few
[1:55:25] all of us I believe have been behind the
[1:55:27] Enemy Lines when you were in a rock and
[1:55:29] a hard place the enemy had really
[1:55:32] Afflicted Samson he was vexed unto death
[1:55:35] finally Samson gave up his Birthright
[1:55:37] and at that moment you you remember how
[1:55:40] the devil tried he's the best to try and
[1:55:43] get to him try and get to him and you
[1:55:45] know the Assumption was a real man of
[1:55:47] God a real child of God he had given his
[1:55:49] heart to the light of Thor
[1:55:52] and his strength to God
[1:55:55] friends I believe
[1:55:57] we should give our strength and our
[1:55:59] heart to the Lord
[1:56:01] we should not divide this God wants
[1:56:03] everything everything you can give him
[1:56:05] you see especially to the young people
[1:56:07] that are in this Fellowship everything
[1:56:08] that you have everything that you can do
[1:56:11] give it to the Lord
[1:56:13] and when you do that you're going to
[1:56:15] watch how God will use you in a mighty
[1:56:17] way
[1:56:18] but the problem of it is we give God our
[1:56:21] strength for something else and then we
[1:56:22] put our heart on something else and
[1:56:24] that's this mistake that Samson did and
[1:56:27] Samson gave up his Birthright and at
[1:56:29] that moment when he gave it up
[1:56:31] uh ah the devil thought
[1:56:33] I have now won him
[1:56:35] I have now won him but Samson was a
[1:56:37] believer
[1:56:38] now remember I told you that as a
[1:56:40] Believer you can never be defeated by
[1:56:42] the enemy you will be delayed you beat
[1:56:44] the raid but you can never be defeated
[1:56:46] another song we've got the power
[1:56:50] in the name of Jesus
[1:56:53] we've got the power
[1:56:57] in the name of the Lord
[1:57:01] listen don't certain rages sing with me
[1:57:05] now we cannot be defeated
[1:57:09] we've got the power
[1:57:13] in the name of an assumption was there
[1:57:17] one thing that Samson had amen right
[1:57:20] there was a seed of God what you have is
[1:57:24] a seed of God hallelujah even when the
[1:57:28] devil takes that seed and bodies it 20
[1:57:31] feet under the ground that seed must
[1:57:34] grow that seed must come out and show
[1:57:37] that it has the life of the original
[1:57:40] and right there they never thought he
[1:57:42] had won the devil when he you know when
[1:57:44] you found yourself in a you know this
[1:57:46] kind of uh Graves of the Anglican Church
[1:57:48] Graves of sin some of you were in the
[1:57:50] graves of birds others went in you know
[1:57:53] this kind of graves of disco your disco
[1:57:55] you know you find you you find yourself
[1:57:57] dancing and sweating right there I don't
[1:57:59] know if anybody has ever been there
[1:58:01] others were in the graves of smoking you
[1:58:03] know others in the graves of alcohol
[1:58:04] they were the best alcoholics that
[1:58:07] Johannesburg has ever seen yeah
[1:58:14] we found ourselves in and the devil
[1:58:18] thought he had won but there was a seed
[1:58:20] of God in our souls the devil could not
[1:58:22] have defeated us
[1:58:25] and right there you see Samsung could
[1:58:29] not have been defeated and remember
[1:58:30] Samson was born for a purpose you were
[1:58:32] born for a purpose God is purpose for
[1:58:34] your life cannot be defeated amen when
[1:58:36] the devil thought he had won some Sons
[1:58:39] began to grow
[1:58:41] again he destroyed more Philistines than
[1:58:45] before Hallelujah I want to just give
[1:58:47] this declaration to you Hallelujah your
[1:58:50] hair is growing back again
[1:58:52] [Music]
[1:58:54] the devil thought when when he would
[1:58:55] confuse
[1:59:00] in our first doctrines he thought he had
[1:59:03] won but let me tell you with this
[1:59:05] message of the hour our hair is
[1:59:07] beginning to grow up again
[1:59:10] hallelujah our hair is growing up again
[1:59:14] Hallelujah we cannot be defeated we are
[1:59:17] the church triumphant we are washing the
[1:59:19] blood we are going to overcome why
[1:59:21] because we are the generation that has
[1:59:24] received thus saith the Lord
[1:59:27] thus saith the Lord has not fail this
[1:59:30] message is not just another church we
[1:59:32] are not just another religion we are the
[1:59:34] bride of Christ in this generation
[1:59:36] we are the generation of Overcomer
[1:59:38] Saints
[1:59:40] Hallelujah
[1:59:41] I would have read your quote in once
[1:59:43] more but let's just carry on so I can
[1:59:45] bring you to a climax here let's open
[1:59:47] the Book of John Chapter 19 Verse 23.
[1:59:52] where he says
[1:59:53] then the soldiers
[1:59:58] reading about our lord Jesus
[2:00:01] then the soldiers went they had
[2:00:03] crucified Jesus
[2:00:06] took his garments
[2:00:08] and made four parts to every Soldier
[2:00:10] apart
[2:00:11] and also he's got
[2:00:13] now the court was woven was without seem
[2:00:16] woven from the top throughout they sit
[2:00:19] there among themselves
[2:00:21] let us not Rend it but because Lords for
[2:00:24] it whose it shall be
[2:00:28] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[2:00:29] which said they patted my Remnant among
[2:00:32] them and for my vesture they did castles
[2:00:35] these things there are for the soldiers
[2:00:37] did Imagine who was this he was our
[2:00:41] savior he was the savior of the world
[2:00:43] Amen just like just like Adam you know
[2:00:46] came down to rescue to rescue Eve
[2:00:49] Our Savior had come down to rescue Adam
[2:00:53] he had come to redeem Adam and his
[2:00:55] entire race which was now fallen in sin
[2:00:58] and when he came down the Bible says he
[2:01:01] came among his own but his own received
[2:01:03] him not
[2:01:04] and he was after he was bitten and you
[2:01:07] know he went through a lot of suffering
[2:01:08] and he went through the spattering him
[2:01:10] and and here now he is on the cross and
[2:01:15] they took off his garments and they cast
[2:01:16] lots on he to try and just make fun of
[2:01:19] it and they said now who will take who
[2:01:21] will have this they cut Castles On His
[2:01:24] Garment but who was it it was The Lord
[2:01:26] Of Glory the king of glory who was on
[2:01:28] that cross
[2:01:29] and he wasn't on that cross for any
[2:01:31] other reason he was on that cross just
[2:01:34] for you and me he was on that cross for
[2:01:36] the for other a better part of him just
[2:01:39] like Adam decided to partake of whatever
[2:01:41] he was doing did you know that the Bible
[2:01:43] says that Adam never sinned
[2:01:48] yes
[2:01:50] can somebody open for me for Timothy
[2:01:53] yes I wanted to read it for us if you
[2:01:55] can open it to anybody first Timothy
[2:01:56] chapter
[2:01:57] I believe it's chapter two
[2:01:59] all right are you there
[2:02:02] all right can you read us that part that
[2:02:04] portion which says that that Eve was in
[2:02:08] the transgression or something like that
[2:02:10] anybody there
[2:02:13] First Timothy chapter 2.
[2:02:15] all right nobody there yes brother you
[2:02:17] are there
[2:02:22] I wanted you to read it in your Bible so
[2:02:23] you can see this in the Bible
[2:02:27] yes anybody just read it
[2:02:32] which verse is that
[2:02:35] 14 okay yes oh the brother has it right
[2:02:37] here yes and Adam was not yes go ahead
[2:02:52] the Bible says that Adam never sinned
[2:02:55] he was not deceived how so
[2:02:59] Adam was not deceived but the woman
[2:03:02] who being deceived was in the
[2:03:06] transgression so that is so that is true
[2:03:09] it was the woman who sinned but remember
[2:03:11] that is a type because remember it was
[2:03:13] the woman that was deceived by the
[2:03:15] serpent so brother balam said that Adam
[2:03:18] did what he did he knew what he was
[2:03:20] doing he did not do it unconsciously he
[2:03:23] did it consciously
[2:03:26] he knew what I'm doing I had to do it in
[2:03:28] order to redeem my wife
[2:03:31] and this was typing God himself what he
[2:03:34] would do to redeem Adam
[2:03:37] when Jesus Christ came the Bible says he
[2:03:39] became can you get us that that verse
[2:03:41] brother he became sin
[2:03:45] the Bible did not say became a sinner no
[2:03:48] our Jesus did not sin
[2:03:51] but the Bible says he became sin
[2:03:55] so that we who are sinners can be able
[2:03:57] to get the righteousness of God
[2:04:01] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[2:04:03] you see it's the same same thing here
[2:04:05] and when Jesus Christ came here he came
[2:04:08] to take our place
[2:04:10] he came so that he can you know take up
[2:04:12] sin on his shoulders and that way he can
[2:04:15] be able to redeem us and so they cast
[2:04:17] loads and beat him up and now John 19 30
[2:04:20] says when Jesus therefore had received
[2:04:23] the vinegar
[2:04:24] he said it is finished
[2:04:27] and he bowed his head and gave up the
[2:04:29] ghost
[2:04:30] ha
[2:04:32] our friend the devil again thought he
[2:04:35] had won
[2:04:36] you know he was the one afflicting Jesus
[2:04:38] the whole time
[2:04:39] and Jesus was going through the pain and
[2:04:42] Agony and the suffering and the devil's
[2:04:44] like yeah I have him from the time when
[2:04:46] they arrested him in the garden the
[2:04:48] devil was right there watching let me
[2:04:49] now see today I have you
[2:04:52] today I have you you have been escaping
[2:04:54] there is one time they wanted to catch
[2:04:55] him and he just went through him through
[2:04:57] them so but this time the devil had also
[2:05:00] laid another strategy you see you
[2:05:02] remember you tried to catch him the
[2:05:03] other time when he went to fasting and
[2:05:05] and and you know he was trying to trap
[2:05:07] him and tell him if you were if you were
[2:05:09] the Son of God you turned these turns
[2:05:11] into bread if you're the Son of God and
[2:05:12] Jesus overcame him but he was like but
[2:05:14] is he the Son of God could he be the one
[2:05:16] because he was using the word if and I'm
[2:05:19] says because he was using if he wasn't
[2:05:21] too sure who he was
[2:05:23] Hallelujah and I want to say the devil
[2:05:25] is not too sure about who you are
[2:05:27] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[2:05:29] if he was sure he would not have
[2:05:31] bothered with you because he knows he
[2:05:32] cannot overcome and at that moment you
[2:05:35] know Jesus as he was at the Garden you
[2:05:38] know he the devil watched he said aha
[2:05:40] now I've used one of the one of one of
[2:05:43] his men to betray him now I am sure he's
[2:05:45] the one but let me see how he will be
[2:05:47] able to go through this this time I have
[2:05:49] him this time I have him as strategy has
[2:05:52] worked
[2:05:53] and and and under judah's brother Judas
[2:05:56] brother Judas came you know you know
[2:05:58] like you know how Catholics work when
[2:06:00] they are having their robes on see this
[2:06:03] is a Holy Ground because this is Jesus
[2:06:05] and by the way I always thought about
[2:06:06] brother Judas you know brother Judas was
[2:06:07] a real believer almost
[2:06:09] do you know do you know that it is
[2:06:11] brother Judas who was always there
[2:06:13] collecting money he was trusted he was a
[2:06:15] good brother he wasn't a bad brother
[2:06:17] after all he he was I mean we have
[2:06:20] trustees here these are people men who
[2:06:21] are trusted men of good character right
[2:06:23] brother Judas was a man of good
[2:06:25] character he knew how to handle money he
[2:06:27] knew he knew Jesus very very well and
[2:06:29] the other thing about brother Judas was
[2:06:31] that he had a burden he had a burden for
[2:06:35] the ministry he told Jesus Luke we could
[2:06:37] just sell this and you know give it to
[2:06:39] the poor and you know you know try to
[2:06:40] help the poor and you know he had a
[2:06:42] heart for maybe he was genuine about
[2:06:44] these things and also he had seen Jesus
[2:06:47] when you know Jesus was going through
[2:06:49] people just like that when they tried to
[2:06:50] catch him he had seen all that so he had
[2:06:52] seen too much to believe that Jesus can
[2:06:55] just Escape
[2:06:57] maybe he thought this is let me use this
[2:06:59] as an Avenue to get what I want so that
[2:07:00] I can be able to do something for my
[2:07:02] family or for something let me just but
[2:07:05] but you know I know Jesus will escape
[2:07:06] anyhow he's God he's God himself
[2:07:09] let me tell you don't negotiate don't
[2:07:11] negotiate because when the devil tries
[2:07:13] to make a negotiate like Judas
[2:07:15] negotiated he lost the battle you know
[2:07:17] so Judas came and he was walking you
[2:07:20] know he was a Believer a good brother
[2:07:21] Hallelujah and you know as he walked to
[2:07:23] Jesus and you know Jesus was standing
[2:07:26] right there brother and as he was
[2:07:27] standing there he looked at him and then
[2:07:30] he you know you know as you know he just
[2:07:33] came and
[2:07:36] Hallelujah God bless you master said and
[2:07:39] and then he looked at him so said oh
[2:07:42] this is how you betrayed the son of man
[2:07:44] with a kiss
[2:07:45] said at that moment he was like anyway I
[2:07:50] know he had to say that but even if I
[2:07:52] betrayed him first of all he has these
[2:07:54] disciples they have swords they will try
[2:07:55] to protect him even if they could not
[2:07:57] protect him he has power he has
[2:07:58] anointing he'll be able to do something
[2:07:59] about this let me stand aside and watch
[2:08:02] brother Peter brought it I think it was
[2:08:04] brother Peter he brought a sword and cut
[2:08:05] off one man's ear you can't take a
[2:08:07] master and then Jesus went down and he
[2:08:10] picked that ear as he was looking at
[2:08:12] that man and he put it back I believe
[2:08:14] brother Judas whatever he was like yeah
[2:08:15] yeah I knew it I knew it he's going to
[2:08:18] do Miracles here this is a miracle
[2:08:20] worker he's going to change everything
[2:08:21] and but you see he was being misguided
[2:08:24] he had negotiated with Saturn and and
[2:08:26] right there when he saw that happen and
[2:08:28] Jesus told you know the other disciples
[2:08:30] he that fights with the sword will die
[2:08:32] with a sword and at that moment
[2:08:34] the the Pharisees came and caught Jesus
[2:08:38] put chains on him and carried him away
[2:08:41] Judas was like
[2:08:44] I can't believe this
[2:08:50] but he did not know he had negotiated
[2:08:52] with Saturn
[2:08:53] and God bless you brother and at that
[2:08:55] moment the devil was like I tricked the
[2:08:58] Judas I tricked you and now this time
[2:09:00] I've got him forever I've won I've won
[2:09:02] and the devil's again through apartheid
[2:09:04] you know they are very good at throwing
[2:09:06] parties
[2:09:08] they always throw a party when they win
[2:09:10] when they think they have won you see
[2:09:12] but usually there but but is always the
[2:09:14] end in chaos you see their parties
[2:09:17] always end in chaos but whenever you
[2:09:19] come here in church and you throw a
[2:09:20] party you know we can throw a party too
[2:09:22] when we Rejoice under the water and
[2:09:23] shout and rejoice and clap our hands and
[2:09:25] sing Hallelujah that's a real party that
[2:09:28] does not end in chaos it ends in
[2:09:29] Deliverance it ends in God doing
[2:09:31] something in your life that's why you
[2:09:34] should never feel sorry when you come
[2:09:35] here and you release yourself and you
[2:09:37] shout and you rejoice you cry hallelujah
[2:09:39] amen something is happening while that
[2:09:42] is going on
[2:09:44] and right there the devil began to throw
[2:09:46] a party and and it was like yeah this
[2:09:48] time we have got him this time is in
[2:09:50] yeah so the demons he told them come on
[2:09:52] we've got him this time he we must not
[2:09:54] rest until his discipline these guys has
[2:09:57] died on the cross and then they took him
[2:09:59] and beat him and beat him and of course
[2:10:01] they took him before the judges and
[2:10:02] everything the devil was right there the
[2:10:03] whole time
[2:10:04] he was following was like I must not
[2:10:06] rest my number one priority is this guy
[2:10:09] he must die
[2:10:11] when he dies then I will know I have
[2:10:13] finished it but he did not know yes he
[2:10:15] might die all right but that is not the
[2:10:17] end that is the beginning
[2:10:19] wholesale
[2:10:22] always has it wrong whenever the devil
[2:10:24] thinks that he has won that's the time
[2:10:27] God comes on the scene and begins
[2:10:29] watching let me tell you you can read
[2:10:32] the Bible from front to back that is how
[2:10:34] God works
[2:10:36] Hallelujah you remember even the the
[2:10:39] time when brother Lazarus died same
[2:10:42] thing they never thought he had won but
[2:10:44] Jesus came and showed up on the very
[2:10:46] last minute
[2:10:47] Hallelujah
[2:10:49] and then we carry on here as I want to
[2:10:52] bring it to a climax so you see here
[2:10:54] John 19 30 and Jesus therefore had
[2:10:57] received Divine again he said it is
[2:10:59] finished and he bowed his head
[2:11:02] give up the ghost
[2:11:05] that put a smile on somebody
[2:11:07] in hell they're like yes yes thanks yeah
[2:11:12] but look John 19 33 says but when they
[2:11:16] came to Jesus and so that he was dead
[2:11:18] already they break not his legs but one
[2:11:21] of the soldiers with a spear pierced his
[2:11:23] side and forth with came there water and
[2:11:26] blood even in death he testified that
[2:11:31] all is well Hallelujah
[2:11:34] even in death as he died that water and
[2:11:37] blood which came out amen it was
[2:11:39] signifying salvation to signifying
[2:11:41] justification and sanctification amen
[2:11:43] there it was God himself women sending a
[2:11:46] testimony of his own death and the devil
[2:11:48] thought he had won when Jesus died he
[2:11:50] didn't know that he he was just the
[2:11:52] beginning this was not a Reformation
[2:11:53] this was a revolution
[2:11:57] it was a total damage to the kingdom of
[2:12:00] darkness and the whole Christian Empire
[2:12:03] is standing because of what happened on
[2:12:05] that cross
[2:12:06] Hallelujah we are here because of what
[2:12:09] happened on that cross oh I wish the
[2:12:11] devil knew but the devil did not know
[2:12:13] look what has happened because of what
[2:12:16] happened that day
[2:12:18] look at what is happening in South
[2:12:20] Africa here in benoni in Kampala all
[2:12:23] over the world because of what happened
[2:12:25] on that cross
[2:12:27] I wish the devil knew but he did not
[2:12:29] know it was just a beginning brother
[2:12:33] Hallelujah
[2:12:36] and I want to finish with this quote
[2:12:37] here well babadam says in the message uh
[2:12:40] glorified Jesus well I'll read one more
[2:12:42] but then he says here when Jesus died
[2:12:44] you're not Calvary
[2:12:45] for appropriation of our sins he died
[2:12:48] not just as a man
[2:12:50] but as seen none of his own but mine and
[2:12:54] your sin sent him to the regions of the
[2:12:56] Lost
[2:12:56] and I can see him when he died young on
[2:12:59] Calvary hanging between the
[2:13:02] malefacturers crying my God why have you
[2:13:06] forsaken me
[2:13:08] and when he gave up The Ghost and bowed
[2:13:10] his head his Spirit went and preached
[2:13:12] the spirits that were in prison that
[2:13:14] repaired they're not in the long
[2:13:15] suffering of the days of Noah the
[2:13:16] scripture says so now skip a beat and
[2:13:18] read this I can hear him say now he has
[2:13:21] reached the Peace of hell
[2:13:24] remember the Devils did what they threw
[2:13:26] a party they are rejoicing and enjoying
[2:13:28] yourself well we finished the man really
[2:13:30] the man everybody was like ah he really
[2:13:34] confused us

[2:13:40] I lost him but this time I was there I
[2:13:43] would Nest the man's death they even
[2:13:44] pierced his side but the devil did not
[2:13:47] know
[2:13:48] while he thought he had won the tables
[2:13:51] were actually changing at that moment
[2:13:54] I can hear him say Saturn
[2:13:57] I just took the key and give it to the
[2:13:59] Apostle Peter for the kingdom of heaven
[2:14:01] but I come down to get the kiss of death

[2:17:56] demonstrating things and he took the
[2:17:58] case off of his side and he put it on
[2:18:01] his side
[2:18:02] Hallelujah
[2:18:04] this was you know you know this was
[2:18:06] signifying victory
[2:18:09] the devil thought he had won he had the
[2:18:12] case but Jesus grabbed them he says give
[2:18:16] me the kiss and he took the kiss and put
[2:18:18] on his side said now hallelujah
[2:18:20] hallelujah
[2:18:22] and he put it on his side getting near

[2:18:28] up
[2:18:30] praise the name of the Lord I said
[2:18:32] praise the name of the Lord I want to
[2:18:34] say today to you even as we are
[2:18:36] approaching the commemoration of Easter
[2:18:38] Jesus has rose again
[2:18:40] [Applause]
[2:18:42] and he got the keys
[2:18:44] they are right by his side he had the
[2:18:47] keys for your problem brother
[2:18:49] he has the keys for your problem he
[2:18:52] consult even the impossible even what
[2:18:55] you did not think is possible he is more
[2:18:58] than ever
[2:19:00] we believe in a message a message
[2:19:02] Hallelujah that solves impossibilities
[2:19:05] how many believe that here
[2:19:08] oh Hallelujah this is so exciting the
[2:19:11] keys are by his side
[2:19:12] [Applause]
[2:19:14] Hallelujah in our country if someone has
[2:19:16] just bought a car we didn't used to
[2:19:19] drive until recently so now when someone
[2:19:22] has bought a car they usually had the
[2:19:24] key
[2:19:25] by their hand just go checking it and
[2:19:29] everybody was like ah this man is rich
[2:19:31] or
[2:19:33] foreign
[2:19:35] even one that did not have a car so what
[2:19:38] they decided to do they go and buy keys
[2:19:41] when they don't have a car
[2:19:43] let me tell you and I begin checking it
[2:19:46] around
[2:19:47] and they would use those kids to kind of
[2:19:50] appeal to girls this younger man is rich
[2:19:53] but actually when I just bought that key
[2:19:55] from the shop somewhere they don't have
[2:19:56] a car but our Jesus is not bluffing he
[2:20:00] really has the case
[2:20:01] he's the mighty conqueror Hallelujah and
[2:20:05] it can conquer your sugar diabetes he
[2:20:07] can conquer your trouble he can conquer
[2:20:09] your disease he can conquer your problem
[2:20:12] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[2:20:16] oh my can you give him a shot of praise
[2:20:19] can you give him a shot of victory
[2:20:22] Hallelujah
[2:20:24] Hallelujah I said Jesus is here right
[2:20:27] now
[2:20:28] when the devil thought he had won amen
[2:20:31] and he had tormented you and taken you
[2:20:32] through all the toys and suffering this
[2:20:35] is the moment
[2:20:36] this is the time when God is showing up
[2:20:39] on the scene by the preaching of the
[2:20:41] word to settle free
[2:20:44] you remember you told them lose them and
[2:20:46] let them go lose them and let them go
[2:20:50] I believe Jesus is saying the same thing
[2:20:52] today and he says there is the Conqueror
[2:20:55] in the message the Great and Mighty
[2:20:57] conqueror there is the Conqueror you
[2:20:59] talk about jacking off aprons
[2:21:02] and waving it
[2:21:05] people say we are crazy because we shout
[2:21:08] because we run because we scream because
[2:21:12] we holler let me tell you we do that in
[2:21:15] message churches why they have never
[2:21:17] failed the Victorious vibrations of
[2:21:20] Heaven
[2:21:20] [Music]
[2:21:22] they say we do that they can't
[2:21:24] understand it because they have never
[2:21:25] felt what we felt they have never
[2:21:29] experienced what we experienced
[2:21:31] Hallelujah
[2:21:33] sometimes you see a pastor preaching
[2:21:35] jumping up shouting running around let
[2:21:37] me tell you he has experienced
[2:21:39] vibrations from heaven
[2:21:41] oh Hallelujah
[2:21:43] and he says the battle is over
[2:21:47] our Great Mighty conqueror has won every
[2:21:50] Victory and he stands alone this morning
[2:21:55] untouched why don't you give him praise
[2:22:01] Hallelujah
[2:22:04] [Applause]
[2:22:06] at the moment when the devil least
[2:22:08] expected you
[2:22:10] to retaliate
[2:22:13] that's the exact thing and timing God
[2:22:15] intended for you to overcome
[2:22:17] God is giving you now strength in your
[2:22:19] weakness
[2:22:21] at the time of your strength
[2:22:24] your rise into the challenge right now
[2:22:27] at a time when you thought you have been
[2:22:29] defeated there is nothing you can do
[2:22:31] about this situation and condition in
[2:22:33] your home in your life
[2:22:35] you know I'm telling you this is the
[2:22:37] time for you to rise to the challenge of
[2:22:38] the Ark
[2:22:39] because Jesus Christ is the same
[2:22:42] yesterday today and forever
[2:22:44] when you thought you could never receive
[2:22:46] the Holy Ghost that's their oh
[2:22:48] [Music]
[2:22:50] I'll give you this testimony as I'm
[2:22:51] finishing one young man came to me and
[2:22:54] we were walking in the evening his uh
[2:22:56] brother-in-law and and he was sharing
[2:22:59] with me he said I'm a minister even
[2:23:01] started preaching but I don't have the
[2:23:02] baptism of the Holocaust he said what
[2:23:04] can I do I don't know what to do Pastor
[2:23:06] just how can I receive the Holy Ghost
[2:23:08] now then I began to take him through it
[2:23:10] but I'm said he said I pulled out my
[2:23:12] phone and began to read the quote he
[2:23:14] said you must believe the Holy Ghost is
[2:23:16] for you Hallelujah and you must believe
[2:23:18] it and when the moment you believe it
[2:23:20] and by the Bible say the longest they
[2:23:21] waited the longest they waited was 10
[2:23:24] days in the upper room 10 days
[2:23:26] Hallelujah by the others Hallelujah the
[2:23:29] moment you believe the moment you
[2:23:32] believe God can fill you with the Holy
[2:23:34] Ghost right there and there
[2:23:36] because he's more willing to give you
[2:23:38] the Holy Ghost than you are willing and
[2:23:40] this young man we had walked like two
[2:23:42] three kilometers and we were in a place
[2:23:44] where they are full of homes and walking
[2:23:46] in the pathway and right there in that
[2:23:49] moment you know something happened in
[2:23:51] his soul I can't explain it he began to
[2:23:54] explode and and speak in tongues and
[2:23:57] shout and holler and you know I was like
[2:23:59] oh people are not seeing us I was like I
[2:24:01] wasn't feeling what he was feeling but I
[2:24:03] knew right there God had visited him and
[2:24:05] God filled him with the Holy Ghost right
[2:24:07] there and then
[2:24:09] when the devil thought he had won and
[2:24:11] the boy was so confused and he was so
[2:24:14] sad and he thought he didn't maybe you
[2:24:15] were not going to Rapture let me tell
[2:24:16] you don't listen to what the devil tells
[2:24:18] you don't listen to what the devil tells
[2:24:20] you did you hear what I said before I
[2:24:22] leave benoni at least hear this don't
[2:24:25] listen to what the devil tells you
[2:24:27] whenever you come to church hear the
[2:24:30] word of God because the word of God is
[2:24:32] sure the word of God is faithful the
[2:24:34] word of God is at the fading the word of
[2:24:36] God can change you and it can do the
[2:24:38] impossibilities
[2:24:39] [Applause]
[2:24:42] when the devil thinks he has won in your
[2:24:44] life watch God begin to move
[2:24:47] oh I wonder if there is somebody here
[2:24:50] who can heal himself so much to God that
[2:24:52] God will move in their soul
[2:24:56] unless something happened that you
[2:24:58] somebody cannot explain away
[2:25:01] that man came back and he said look all
[2:25:04] I know
[2:25:05] all I know I was lame but now I was
[2:25:08] blind but now I can see I was lame but
[2:25:10] now I can walk I don't care about the
[2:25:12] Fanatics what they say
[2:25:13] what what you need right now is attached
[2:25:16] from him a touch of the master
[2:25:20] kind of singers come let us sing the
[2:25:22] song we are more than conquerors we've
[2:25:25] been made more than conquerors
[2:25:27] Overcomers in this life oh Hallelujah

[2:25:51] of our prophet
[2:25:53] is with us in our generation too
[2:25:57] to prove to you that you are the
[2:25:59] generation of Overcomers
[2:26:01] you are going to overcome this
[2:26:04] the enemy has no power over you

[2:26:09] victory has been won by our Great and
[2:26:12] Mighty conqueror Jesus Christ
[2:26:14] and he is here
[2:26:16] hallelujah it's not because I said it
[2:26:19] but I believe that whenever his word is
[2:26:21] spoken it takes vibrations in the hearts
[2:26:23] of the people and and Faith begins to
[2:26:26] build up and things began to to happen
[2:26:28] and even the impossibilities now become
[2:26:30] possible

[2:54:36] for pastor possible amen
[2:54:40] for being used in mightily of him
[2:54:43] when the devil thought
[2:54:45] he had won
[2:54:48] right at that moment when he thought he
[2:54:50] had Samson
[2:54:52] the Bible says there was a new shock of
[2:54:54] hair that was growing
[2:54:56] and the promise was in his hair
[2:55:00] and it took a lot he said lead me to the
[2:55:02] pillars of this building
[2:55:05] brother Branham says in that day there
[2:55:07] was more Philistines gathered in there
[2:55:10] than ever he had encountered in his life
[2:55:14] he killed more when the enemy thought he
[2:55:18] had won
[2:55:21] you know I was thinking about Samaria
[2:55:23] when it was besieged
[2:55:26] and how there were four lepers that were
[2:55:28] out there
[2:55:30] when the enemy thought he had won
[2:55:34] but God was joining four men
[2:55:37] and amplifying their presence
[2:55:40] uh
[2:55:42] right at that moment brother
[2:55:45] where a man had made a reckless prophecy
[2:55:49] a reckless declaration
[2:55:51] to say tomorrow by this time
[2:55:55] you shall have a measure of flower and
[2:55:57] Bali being sold for a shekel
[2:56:00] when things and odds were against the
[2:56:03] situation
[2:56:05] when it looked like it's not possible
[2:56:08] but God was waking out another
[2:56:10] possibility
[2:56:12] God was working out a plan
[2:56:15] and I want to tell you that God is
[2:56:17] working out a plan in your life
[2:56:20] when it looks like you are down and
[2:56:22] dusted
[2:56:24] your finished brother
[2:56:26] right there your name is being called
[2:56:32] Hallelujah
[2:56:34] imagine in a contest
[2:56:37] and there's 50 people and they're
[2:56:40] calling the names of the winners
[2:56:43] and there was one person that everybody
[2:56:45] thought would be number one
[2:56:47] and they've called the 49
[2:56:50] and you also had counted that person to
[2:56:53] be the number one and there's only one
[2:56:55] name
[2:56:56] that is left
[2:56:58] to be called out
[2:57:01] people everyone's eyes
[2:57:04] will be on that one person that everyone
[2:57:07] suggests to be the winner
[2:57:09] and there the announcement goes
[2:57:12] and your name
[2:57:15] is the one that is called at that moment
[2:57:22] in soccer that's what they call a caved
[2:57:24] ball
[2:57:26] it's a ball that is not Direct
[2:57:29] kicked as if it's going this side but
[2:57:32] somewhere in the air it turns
[2:57:35] that's what happened with Goliath
[2:57:37] after boasting for 40 days asking for a
[2:57:40] man
[2:57:41] and God brought a boy
[2:57:45] and brother Branham says David didn't
[2:57:48] throw the stone on target
[2:57:50] he says he took the slingshot and threw
[2:57:53] the stone anyhow
[2:57:56] are you hearing that
[2:57:57] he threw the stone anyhow and he says in
[2:58:01] the Holy Ghost
[2:58:03] caught a hold of the Stone
[2:58:06] and redirected the stone
[2:58:10] [Music]
[2:58:13] Hallelujah
[2:58:17] if David had missed
[2:58:20] people would have died
[2:58:24] imagine if David had missed Goliath
[2:58:28] that rage that Goliath would have heard
[2:58:31] at the time but right there David was
[2:58:34] not on target
[2:58:36] and everyone was seeing that David is
[2:58:39] not on target the stone is going this
[2:58:42] way and David and Goliath is standing
[2:58:44] that way and the Holy Ghost
[2:58:48] got a hold of the Stone
[2:58:52] Hallelujah
[2:58:54] and the stone started moving towards
[2:58:57] collage
[2:58:58] and collab turned his head like this and
[2:59:01] the stone turns towards his head and
[2:59:03] could attend his head like this
[2:59:06] it was a programmed Stone
[2:59:11] this technology that you hear of the
[2:59:14] anti-ballistic missile that they can put
[2:59:16] coordinates
[2:59:18] to say this
[2:59:20] missile should hit this plane
[2:59:23] those missiles if the plane goes like
[2:59:25] this the missile follows
[2:59:28] it's programmed to the Target and the
[2:59:31] the stone was programmed to the Target
[2:59:33] it was not Stone number two it was Stone
[2:59:36] number one
[2:59:39] many times you know when somebody comes
[2:59:42] to me and say pray for me I pray for
[2:59:43] them
[2:59:44] and they come the second time I ask a
[2:59:46] question
[2:59:47] which prayer should we believe
[2:59:50] should we believe this one that I'm
[2:59:52] making right now or should we believe
[2:59:54] Stone number one I always believe
[2:59:59] Stone number one is powerful are you
[3:00:02] hearing what I'm saying

[3:00:17] paralyzed when the preacher said he says

[3:01:20] and brother Brahm says and he he he
[3:01:22] lifted his leg and give Satan a kick
[3:01:28] brother Brown says
[3:01:30] God gave
[3:01:32] Satan a kick in the spinal cord

[3:06:01] Hallelujah whatsoever we're buying on
[3:06:04] Earth is bound in heaven
[3:06:06] [Applause]
[3:06:09] brother promises the church has the
[3:06:11] power to shut
[3:06:12] and to lose the heavens just like Elijah
[3:06:16] and we don't have to wait for three and
[3:06:18] a half years
[3:06:18] [Music]
[3:06:20] are you hearing me we don't have to wait
[3:06:22] for three and a half years we can chat
[3:06:25] and we can lose
[3:06:27] if with us and when we have lost its
[3:06:31] offer
[3:06:33] [Music]
[3:06:34] [Applause]
[3:06:37] we used to hunt beds with stones
[3:06:41] you shoot it a bit
[3:06:43] you watch your stone and you watch the
[3:06:45] bed
[3:06:46] sometimes you see your stone eating
[3:06:49] right on the bed
[3:06:50] and then and then after some time the
[3:06:54] bid Rises and goes
[3:06:57] if you were a wise Hunter
[3:07:00] you would follow that bet
[3:07:03] we used to call it kafiramberry
[3:07:06] we would say this dead this bed is
[3:07:08] flying but it's flying under shock but
[3:07:10] in the real terms it's actually dead
[3:07:13] that's what I want to tell you
[3:07:15] even if you see that this is flying
[3:07:19] just under shock
[3:07:21] but the stone that has hit it
[3:07:24] it's actually dead while it's lying
[3:07:27] foreign
[3:07:31] [Applause]
[3:07:34] God has removed the element that kills
[3:07:38] in your disease
[3:07:39] are you hearing that so so they can scan
[3:07:42] and they can still see the lump of
[3:07:44] cancer but that the life of the cancer
[3:07:47] has been removed it has been condemned
[3:07:53] Hallelujah
[3:07:55] you say this Prophet is going to die
[3:07:57] because the stone that is heated is
[3:08:01] serious
[3:08:02] this smoking weakness is going to die
[3:08:05] because the stone that has heated
[3:08:09] glory to God
[3:08:12] we have just had our Easter meetings
[3:08:16] God bless you
[3:08:18] God bless you
[3:08:21] God bless you
[3:08:24] my what can we say
[3:08:29] beautiful preaching
[3:08:32] wonderful things
[3:08:34] God works in very simple ways brother
[3:08:38] I usually say if the preacher says
[3:08:40] something about my situation
[3:08:42] to me it's over
[3:08:45] that's what I come to church for
[3:08:47] I am just waiting
[3:08:49] to hear something about me
[3:08:53] if it talks about my theophany
[3:08:56] if he talks about my situation at home
[3:08:58] if he talks about my prayer points
[3:09:01] to me it's over
[3:09:03] are you hearing me I have confidence
[3:09:06] more in God
[3:09:08] when that is done
[3:09:11] and the word is The Descent
[3:09:13] of the thoughts
[3:09:15] you see when we preach we are just short
[3:09:17] of saying thus save the Lord
[3:09:20] but it will be thus says the Lord
[3:09:22] because brother Brown says the bride yes
[3:09:24] God that says the Lord in him
[3:09:27] so the preaching of the word
[3:09:30] is that says the Lord
[3:09:32] you know I say a lot of people get
[3:09:33] excited when they are reading the spoken
[3:09:35] word and you hear a preacher saying you
[3:09:37] see here brother Branham even said
[3:09:39] that's
[3:09:44] if that says the Lord
[3:09:46] [Applause]
[3:09:52] Paul came and right he says it is not
[3:09:55] the Lord
[3:09:57] it is I
[3:09:59] and then at the end of the chapter he
[3:10:02] says but if any man think himself to be
[3:10:04] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[3:10:06] very words that I speak are of the Lord
[3:10:11] just in case you get excited
[3:10:14] that says the Lord
[3:10:18] I would rather believe a positive thing
[3:10:21] being spoken over my life
[3:10:23] than to be told you never make it
[3:10:26] the devil thought he had won
[3:10:30] but Adam was there to say don't worry
[3:10:34] I'll redeem you
[3:10:36] and God was there to say don't worry
[3:10:39] I'll redeem here
[3:10:41] you cannot be lost
[3:10:43] because you're saved
[3:10:45] please check out greetings with
[3:10:48] to Kampala
[3:10:50] tell them we appreciate them
[3:10:53] thank them for releasing you
[3:10:56] if the Lord carries one day will come
[3:10:59] and see them in Kampala
[3:11:02] see the bride in in Uganda
[3:11:05] you know
[3:11:06] [Music]
[3:11:09] I'm always amazed at how God has got a
[3:11:12] witness everywhere
[3:11:14] you know
[3:11:15] you see a man you have never met
[3:11:17] and you can sit and you can talk
[3:11:19] yesterday we had to
[3:11:21] forced to cut our fellowship
[3:11:24] we could have gone on and on
[3:11:27] because you're just seeing a person who
[3:11:28] believes the same thing
[3:11:32] and everywhere I travel I always say you
[3:11:34] know with my natural relatives maybe we
[3:11:37] just talk about what's important about
[3:11:38] the family how is Uncle how is what
[3:11:41] happened to the plot and you know those
[3:11:43] things
[3:11:43] and after three hours the conversation
[3:11:45] is over
[3:11:48] and then you see you start talking about
[3:11:49] politics
[3:11:52] but when you meet
[3:11:56] it's so talking to Soul
[3:12:00] oh brother when the souls were opened
[3:12:03] you know and there was there was
[3:12:04] something that he was uh he was speaking
[3:12:07] about
[3:12:09] when we were fellowshipping and I said I
[3:12:12] didn't tell him then but I said this I
[3:12:14] think this needs to be preached when
[3:12:16] we're talking about the sacrifices
[3:12:18] that's been done for the message
[3:12:20] you know
[3:12:23] um
[3:12:23] he's been very privileged you know to to
[3:12:26] have a relationship with
[3:12:29] some of the greatest ministers in the
[3:12:31] message pastor biscal Pastor Villa ratif
[3:12:34] you know
[3:12:36] uh you know brother John and is dead the
[3:12:39] one that transcribed the message and you
[3:12:42] know those great men and the sacrifice
[3:12:45] that they did for the message and and I
[3:12:47] was thinking while we're fellowshipping
[3:12:50] the other men that I know that God has
[3:12:53] used for the sacrifice
[3:12:55] and we're talking about how young people
[3:12:57] now take this message casually
[3:13:00] you know and just feel like no you know
[3:13:03] we you know these days are different but
[3:13:06] the sacrifice you can't rub it
[3:13:08] and I was thinking of the song is
[3:13:10] dripping with blood
[3:13:12] this Holy Ghost Gospel and I thought but
[3:13:15] we're no longer talking about just the
[3:13:16] Bible now we're talking about the spoken
[3:13:19] word itself
[3:13:20] these men might not have died
[3:13:24] with blood coming out
[3:13:27] but they lost something they a piece of
[3:13:30] them died
[3:13:31] I believe you know maybe next time he
[3:13:34] comes we'll have you know some sessions
[3:13:35] where
[3:13:36] we have you like talk you know you know
[3:13:39] whichever the Lord lays upon your heart
[3:13:41] and
[3:13:43] it will be a blessing
[3:13:45] we appreciate God so much
[3:13:48] for such a wonderful time
[3:13:50] it's been long since since I sang this
[3:13:52] song
