interactive whereby each of you or each of us can be able to speak and highlight those parts while they were reading uh that really made sense to them and while you do that i'm sure that someone else will be blessed and we can always comment on those things as well uh polycarp republica did you give him a church edible okay john did you come with your no you forgot it okay you always ah there's no way you could courage what okay here's what we are going to do in our coming meetings if you leave your bible and your church age we don't allow you to participate which means we shall excommunicate

where are we starting today where are we starting from from this side i may not finish the church edge book the the the the ephesian church age okay good good a good number that's really nice uh how many have not the ones who have not actually is also a good number so i think i think today i do not know i think people are becoming a bit more lazy sister kelo have you finished your efficient church age by show of hands i think somehow your network is not really great so it's kind of lagging a bit behind but uh i saw sister john saying she has finished a house it's always very important that you finish so that by the time we start discussing a chapter you're already a little bit ahead and you can understand what we are talking about okay so sister fortunate have you finished you are have you finished the ephesians church edge why this time you have been a bit lazy okay we are beginning with science uh okay can someone be ready to work on the camera please we need to have a video of each and every person talking so that those who are online can be able to see them and also follow us along uh it seems today the network is not good for very many people but we shall push ahead nonetheless okay so can i just choose where we are starting or there is someone ready to start okay but the job will start and while he does i don't i is are you okay there okay what's the problem can you go and help if you need to help okay we're having the other problem we're having a problem with the other computer so just give it a second uh-huh is it is it well now now i also understand that it is a sister brother okay sister akit joining in today so they could be joining by youtube okay okay okay we shall start with brother joel and we'll go on like these to the other side it's good bless you as he works can you refresh the page where you're reading for everyone page two as he walks in the middle of his church he is aware of the suffering of these people and he cares as it was the base of the captivity in egypt when he had their prize uh he who never changes still hears the cry of the oppressed as he walks a man amongst them never signifies but they suffer from him they were patient and committed committed all to him who had promised lasting perform peace in heaven for what they had given up for [Music] whatever we are going through god knows what we are going through he knows what his children are going through praise god here he knew what these these people in initiation they were laboring they were laboring all for all that they had to serve the lord that's what what was the main uh purpose that they are doing that's what we are also supposed to do [Music] hardships but god knows what you are going through that's what you say that i you know i know that works my liver are my patients so uh 12 patients that means enough to grow some some hard conditions because without without going through hardships then we shall not shall not uh we should our patients should not be proven but when we go through hard times then god will organize what we are going through our patience everything we go through we have to know that god knows what we need and trials are natural normal part of christian life there is only one thing you can do about them commit them all together judge not and leave their house out working it is a normal part of christian life if we are to live in life um praise the lord now uh god bless you brother and no one was uh hearing what he was saying right did everybody hear what he was saying okay so now there is a certain things that he had he has touched that i thought are very important uh you know the ephesian church by the way before we even continue to discuss the there is a part i would like all of us to understand before we start to discuss the edges all the things that i inside the church edges now i want to first ask you a question and this question will be the guiding question for us to be able to start to learn about the edges then we can be able to go into them because now we already that the poet was discussing is a very good one but it is already in the middle but we what we need to understand i want to ask you a question what do you understand when someone just says church ages what do you make of it okay we'll move quickly now we need each of you to give us your understanding brother brother joel what do you understand when we say the church agents uh the church of god in different ages okay that's a good answer can we have another one from what time to what time after some years after some years but from what time how god works in a specific period of time right but when did he start working because we are we are not specifically talking about the church agents the church edges the edges of the church so when did he start working among the church oh during the time of the church when was that do you know that the beginning of that time okay so this is what is intended for you to know all right brother marvin what do you say has been god bless you tell him god bless you all right brother buddy what do you understand what someone says the church agents what do you understand yeah quiet go ahead just continue proceed okay no you don't need to do that yes so you mean the church was like one church how many times different durations from what time from when to so where are we in now where are we in that timeline when the lesson called my my mind god bless you all right let us have you brother you yourself you the one who is on the camera let us have you okay when when someone tells you uh by the way you don't need to keep switching off the camera no problem so and now we need to understand what your your idea or your understanding is when we talk about the church ages the seven church ages what comes to your mind these leaders how do they emerge because there have been very many leaders and preachers and the men of god and prophets all through the since the day of pentecost until today so how how do they emerge yes of course there are other people help them but they are chosen by their lord yeah all right god bless you for that okay brother polika uh that when you hear the church edges what comes to your mind is using some different people different people to take sorry can you clarify on that and be a bit loud people are taking specific messages okay so you've now you've now introduced a new word gentile church so can we now say that these are gentle churches yes okay did you hear what i said are they gender churches or it is the general church okay so what's the difference between the gentle church and the digital churches uh yes all right wow that's very good that's very good god bless you let us have brother shame shame carry on from where he stopped uh he said that he used the word picture but i think he meant that they were symbolic to the charges that we had to come so can we say that uh the the the chat when we say the seven church edges it's not merely what was in asia or is it also that plus today can you carry on from there okay you can just bring your own no problem but in so how do we know which phase we are in okay so we can see certainly the conditions we are in now and the situation of the church the condition of the church but how do we know that the condition of the child that we are in now is the last the second the third or the fourth how do we know how can we know how can you convince somebody you are in the in the last not in the second well it is well explained okay and three yeah from you know the first half these conditions will do you want to give us a sample for that you just feel free to pick any charge of your choice explain the conditions of that child then you try to point ask the fact that it is a past time or it is the current time oh um the beginning good so in other words the condition of the last charge would be or the the last church there called la de caya would be that it is luke 1. so whichever generation that was luke 1 we can say that the last one yes exactly but the generation that the bible says that was luke 1 that would be part of the condition of the last church so friends when do you think was a time when the church was lukewarm do you even know what lukewarm means someone maybe join may not understand someone explain look one what does luke 1 mean yes exactly you are not you are not entirely in christ and also you are not entirely in the world so you are a mediocre you are in the middle you have part christ part world and that is being lukewarm amen so but by the grace of god he has in every church age a people that he calls for his name those that he has intended to call out from that church age so we have okay fine but i'll explain a little bit after everybody has given their view okay can you please proceed to sister peace your idea of the church the church age thank you for that explanation by the shame please if you can stop switching that off god sends different people too yes what is go what is the work of these messengers sorry okay you know you don't just need to to answer it as if you are answering an exam you are answering you to help someone else who don't who doesn't know what you know you know something also you've had for many years not so so you can explain it for sure in a better way that's what you know all right sister can we go to the next sister as well ah why are you skipping the the small one that one is not isn't part of the okay sister elise can you please tell us what you know about the seven churches sit up right please so we can see very well in the camera the camera is already seeing you you want to say something do you want to say something okay can we move to the next sister she has brought another new word the bride that's the one that none of you was able to highlight now remember that these are how many churches but all this one these seven churches the purpose is to pick a bride out of each of them in the book of thessalonians chapter 4 first the thessalonians the bible says the dead in christ shall rise first when jesus christ comes with the trump sounding of the trumpet the dead and god shall rise fast then we which are alive and remain shall be changed shall be caught up to together with them and we go in the sky to meet the lord so there is that time coming where there is going to be a resurrection but that resurrection is the resurrection of who the bride when we say the bride we are not only talking about those of us of this generation we are talking about the bride which was being collected or being gathered from the days of the apostles and that's the first age ephesus those of abraham uh i i i can i can even put them under that age as well because remember when jesus christ came he they rose again actually they had their rapture they rose from the graves and and they they were changed and those who are also together with the believers of the first age waiting on the trumpet of god to sound so when the trumpet sounds they will all arise and then we shall also our body shall be changed these are realities the bible speaks of them but denominations don't but thank god we believe the bible and we have received a messenger in this generation all right brother okela i know you have a load for us on that subject amendment first we have one word it means that the same word is revealed in these seven chapters with a specific message passage another whole new idea speaking of the same god hallelujah the same god in every age it's not a different god that the god of the first age the god of the second age the god of the father no he is the god of all ages you remember how you know in that candlestick he saw what what did he see john what did he see he saw seven golden candlesticks or lampstands and then within that lamp stand was one like unto the son of man and he had in his hand how many seven stars and these seven stars the bible says are actually meaning angels to the churches the seven churches are you following me yes so every every church has one angel every church has one angel but all these seven churches actually have one that is standing be between all of them hallelujah so it was this one who was like unto the son of man who is he it is none other but the lord jesus christ he was the one standing in the middle of the candlestick meaning the candlesticks is what the church and now he is standing in the middle of them and he has in his hands which means even the seven stars they are in his hand he is the one who controls them so i love that idea that you brought of the one god is the same god that's why the teachings of the of all the angels have to almost be similar it has to be the same message they all had to believe one god that's what i was asking you brother isaac you see all these angels all these messengers how do we how can we tell that it is this one this is that one that the same god who said paul is the same god who said his brother the son the same god who sent martin luther is the same god who sent john to easily the same god who said iranians is the same god who said martin you understand so it is the same god therefore these messengers must all have the same same characteristics hallelujah so these are these messengers or these angel messengers they must all have the same characteristics or the same uh yeah not entirely the same message because it is different messages we will go along but uh they are they are those that are assaulted like one god the teaching on one god all those messengers have to believe it you know because that was the basic the basic truth and so they all had to believe in the in the in the in the god being the same yesterday's done forever all of them believed in god and believed in the power of god and the powers of miracles and the unchanging god they believed in the unchanging god so you can see that the messengers were in the right hand of of of god and god was on controlling them all through hallelujah amen brother john you want to say something not yet oh yes what is your understanding currently of the seven of the seven churches please can you repeat i think i missed you somewhere the presents okay the face is okay thank you yeah yes yes and in every church yes yes and does that mean that uh in that particular age there would be no other people that god would use the holy spirit would entirely use only one man to pass a message to people that's a hard one huh yes but what you what you answered was perfectly right but you see i wanted you also to add on this that in every one of those ages there will be other people that god will use but there will be one main prophet one major prophet but there will be very many others that god will use okay it's just like a prophet for example in the first age paul was the messenger god picked him to go and preach the message to the gentiles but does it mean he was the only one no there was peter there was all the other disciples they were still alive even at that time but guess what it was apostle paul with the revelation of the word of the hour at that time you know he had the final say on what was to be believed at that time i'll give you an example do you know that peter believed before paul because peter was one of the disciples of jesus christ but paul came much later so peter believed that the jews cannot that are the only ones to be saved and peter believed that the gentiles cannot hear the gospel and therefore i also believe that it's not even right to eat paul can they he believed it's not right to under jewish traditions it's not right to eat pork it's not trying to preach among a gentiles it's not right to for a man not to be circumcised so i mean the things that the jews believed peter believed as much as he believed jesus and he preached to him but when it came to paul because he was the star of the age the messenger of the age the angel of the age the prophet of the age god gave him a little more revelation than all the others including peter paul preached that you can eat anything as long as you're prayed for for it the blood of jesus cleanses it paul believed even the gentiles must hear the gospel in fact he said that now it is the time for the gentiles paul believed that uh whether you are circumcised or not as long as you believe you understand and they fought with peter peter was saying no brother you are me miss misunderstanding and you are confusing people but the paul said no brother peter you are wrong on this and god came down and confirmed it to peter that he was wrong when the came from heaven and told him you know to go and preach among the gentiles and also to kill and eat so i mean god vindicated in many ways that apostle paul was the angel to that age but there was also others that god used number one number two there were also those who were the prophetic gifts like agaves agaves was in the time of peter i mean paul and paul was a major prophet but agabus was also a prophet you know so that god will always use very many people all over the world in every age but in every generation there is that particular one he uses as a major prophet to that generation amen so i love that uh brother brother can you also give us your understanding i think it's still fine in my perspective what i understand is to receive its message in different times you're done so what's the main point of what you see a period of time what has given each other has given each church now you are summarizing he's summarizing everything the church ages is a specific or as an entirely a period of time that god has allotted to the bride to receive her message to prepare her for the rapture amen all right sister fortunate that's that was that's very nice that's a very good summer reaction from time to time what saw this happening because from the time of pentacles the church has been changing things have been changing so he saw it and made john prophesied something like that those so since things have been changing they have to be a messenger for each age for example right now maybe technology what so they would have to send some other messenger who can preach on those changes because let me talk about it before the last maybe let me say the second church edge maybe there's something that's happening right now which wasn't happening before so god didn't send a messenger to preach about things that are happening now which weren't happening before so i think god was looking at how the world is going to be how they are going to keep changing and sends different amen even you need to give a clap that was very very good now i agree with her that every age is different every age is different and the situations in that ages different ages are always also different so that's why god needs to send a messenger for every age to only look at the condition of that age and give like like there's a problem that's the let me put it this way there is a sickness a spiritual sickness for every age there therefore god has a good doctor he will prescribe the same the same medicine with the same healing power but a different draws for everyday sickness so that you can be healed hallelujah you even see him also using that same language in some of the ages for example when you were reading the the gender the foundation age he he says what he says that by of migo tried in the fire that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and he also said he said that also by that also he called it in amharic they called it cool the eye cell that your eye that you may see you know i said it was like the medicine for the eyes so so god is really a doctor a doctor and he prescribes the medicine of every generation through a messenger of that generation what would happen to our someone who does not accept the message of the messenger of that generation living in that generation two people are saying the same thing what if you don't accept the word do we have let me ask a question do we have a different now we're talking about an angel right a messenger can someone be saved in a generation when they reject the message sent to their generation yes yes can you give an explanation to your answer uh they can reject each of the message and they will be counted by the revelation of the previous [Music] no what i'm saying is you can like let's say for example brother murray but if you reject his message you can and you're a christian i don't mean like predicting it but you reject it as a christian and you feel it's not good for you you will be counted upon the message of the previous fathers the forefathers so can we now say that uh when we never go out preaching and people don't believe they say well i don't believe it but it's nice continue preaching it you know oh fine no problem brother you are my brother you'll be counted in the other generation can we continue preaching like that way no no he is explaining but you won't continue saying grace is there you can't keep rejecting the word of god just because you know exactly now i need i need us to understand that principle here i want us to understand a principle praise the name of the lord god has a principle and he moves along with his principle all through okay whosoever believes him will not what but shall have now when jesus christ came in the world he told them what if ye were if god was your father you should have believed in me and even if you not have believed me but at least for my work sake you would have believed me these people were believers of another generation also but why didn't they believe him and where and what was his conclusion as jesus to them you are of youra he said of your father the devil and yet these people believed in the law of moses they did not ever eat any pork they did not transgress the jewish law they never they kept the sabbath they never coveted someone else's thing i mean they were holy according to the jewish lord we're not even talking about people we're talking about the the very priests the ones who were the preachers of the what of the law but when jesus christ comes to them and they don't accept him they do not see the message of their hour the message of their day he tells them you are of your father the devil why on the basis because they have rejected him now there is a very thin line here i agree that there are people in every generation that will always lack because this chart as you are reading you'll find out that these church edges lap over one another okay so sometimes believers of the other generation will come into another just like that just like that right so we have we don't know where the separating line is but god does but if one is a believer really believing in god with all their heart there is absolutely no reason why they would not see farther light more light when it comes and by the bottom says but what do they do they dominate and when they denominate what happens when they denominate they die whenever they denominate they die they denominate they die they denominate because their denomination cannot bring forth life it's only the word of god through the message of the hour that will bring forth life okay let me keep keep up with the other thought of uh of lapping over the believers of the other generation and i'll give you an example can you please open uh someone read for me acts chapter 19. acts chapter 19 is someone there is someone without a bible yet brother where is your bible oh you are lester to open your bible from verse one hey brother where is your bible oh okay fine okay can you begin reading please someone who is okay john you're reading can you read kjv oh you're good okay let's and start certain disciples he said i'm children have you received the holy ghost since you believe and they say them to him we have loved so much as kindness whether they are being before we proceed are they believers yes why which message do they believe [Music] they believe the message of john that you know you remember john was coming at that time before the general dispensation started you understand so it was john trying to connect the jews who were in the other generation you know johnny came at a time when they they the message was lapping over so now he because he was he was connecting the ones who were in the law connecting them to the grace he was bringing the jews introducing jesus christ to them now jesus has already come john has already died he came died finished his ministry and these ones now are the believers who believe this ministry so and now the bible tells us that apollos who was at corinth and paul now who is paul the messenger of the new generation of the new age okay that god has set now to start the gentile dispensation all right so now paul was passing around there in the upper courts around there around the ephesus you see he was passing around this area and he found his disciples there that's true that they should believe on him we should come after him that is jesus hallelujah can you imagine that uh these people are even already baptized by a person who baptized jesus himself and now john is born is asking them by the way my brothers have you ever seen the holy ghost since you believed they said ah brother paul what are you talking about we don't even know what you're talking about huh the man that do we believe and we didn't hear anything about the world but we know all all about the repentance and the you know how he baptized by john he don't know the one overpriced jesus now once that happens then paul said ah now i know what you're talking about you believe the message but that message is now dead man you heard what i said didn't you the manner was coming in the in in the old testament every day every day every day and whenever a day passed that manner was no longer leaving it wouldn't decay and they don't even have some mangoes in it so which means what did god mean god was meaning that because you remember that is the jewish church and whenever we talk about the jews it is a type always shadow of what's going to happen among the gentiles spiritually so for them to receive the physical manner for us we are receiving spiritual man which is the word of god for them they received his command they eat it so now but that man i was not alive like like the whole week seven days a week no that man was every day they would go and pick another if you say ah me i want i love this one so much let me keep it so that i can now start from there tomorrow you know those ones do like my wool they want to keep the food and then they eat it in the morning because they are so sweet this chicken is so nice let me keep some i'll eat i'll begin from there tomorrow morning now by the time you go to check in your plate you'll find there muggles jumping around because it was there so you had to go there again and look for another one for that the fresh one for that day imagine that's how god put it so easy with the church edges when you lap over to another generation you have to pick another the new message you have to receive the new message for that age amen now we find out here these ones have come in and they are they been lapped over into a paul's age and paul is visiting them ah i know your problem you have believed the old message now let me tell you there's a new message what the other one i was telling here is another very good idea is that all these messengers as much as their message looked like a new but it wasn't entirely new it was the one would be the foundation another builds or need another builds on it you understand the other one this one did not come again refusing the other one no the other night later foundation for this one to come and be good on top so now when paul was coming he said ah yeah but that baptism was not wrong but it was half truth okay because now the baptism paul was baptizing with it did not only have the holy ghost but it also had repentance in it but the one of john was only the baptism of repentance you have you repent you repent of your sins yes you are going to smoke peace you're not going to drink yes you're not going to go to fornication yes okay fine no you come now go be afraid of repentance another one come you understand just deepening what i'm going but that was okay but that was only a little bit now when paul came he began to tell them now you now need to not only paint but you need to receive the gift of the holy ghost and remember you can only receive the holy ghost if you believe in the death and resurrection of jesus christ according to what peter said where in the book of acts chapter 2 someone read for me quickly acts chapter two just go back a little a few verses uh acts chapter two verses uh two chapter two verse number eight quickly quickly read it now who is there can you read in the name of jesus christ yes so he now tells them that they should repent by now this is before peter paul started even preaching can you imagine so no matter which preacher it is churches can be many but if they are all led by the same holy spirit they must say the same things so we find out here that peter was already a preacher before even paul started but the paul is now saying the same thing that peter here is saying he said the same holy spirit was in him telling him to tell them to repent and be baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ for the remission of their sins and that they should receive the gift of hallelujah friends can you go through that procedure one by one what's the first thing repentance the second thing the third thing you skip some things let us start again one repentance number two baptism number three remission of sins number four receive the gift of the holy spirit so now these ones in acts 19 in the ones who were at ephesus they had number one they repented they had repented number two being baptized in much water right yes but now did they receive the remission of sins [Laughter] how many say they did it they did yes how many say they didn't okay can we have two two reasons the ones who said they didn't receive the holy spirit i mean they didn't receive the remission of their sins you are the many people they okay those who are saying they didn't receive the the parts of the world they didn't receive the remission of their sins yes and why because at that time thank you who else you you think why you don't know okay the ones who say they did receive the box of the holy ghost ah of course the remission of sins is what i'm talking about yes yes the holy spirit i think wasn't there me i'm just challenging watch your sage yes you understand yes even during jesus okay that's good now but yeah you know when jesus died he shed his blood and his blood oh this is a very good and i'm enjoying it all right yes do you have another one yeah you don't have a point at all on this in the name of jesus christ were they baptized in the name of jesus christ no so we all agree on that so were their sins forgiven yes yes why they were forgiven friends what does the bible say please let us go back to bible teaching okay uh can i run a scripture here quick quick quick i find it those who are online what are you saying the baptism of john did it remove sins or not the baptism of john did they remain sin they didn't wash away their sins or not please please if you if you have a point just animate yourself and give us your answer okay sister against is saying no they did not can you please give us your reason my my my this is a very good one hallelujah i want you to read i'm waiting for your reason sister as i'm giving you the bible answer not my answer because if i give you mind it would be another opinion and then we can continue from there hallelujah can we begin in the old half if we begin the old testament uh huh you people are i'll kill you with verses i have very many countless of them someone whenever i mention a vast open week you read another one like that like that okay matthew 26 28 first someone opened that another open mark 1 4. repentance for four wait don't conclude where there are sins remitted i mean who was it john was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching baptism of repentance the repentance that they were going to do was the one which would bring forth the remission of sins but wait a moment that was not all of it okay because remember that the the remission of sins could not come without a sacrifice there had to be a sacrifice for the remission of sin to take effect that is why in the in the in the in acts in a well did we read about john no no that's 19 yes these people were believers they had repented because if you have repented you are a believer but they are sins we are not remitted why can you first read for me that give me that one as you are also giving me acts chapter two acts chapter two verse number eight come on quickly now which is shared for many for the revision of sins now listen this one is saying because jesus was the one to wash away their sins all right now listen does water wash away our sins does the water wash away our sins some denominations like the baptists and the oneness pentecostals the jesus only they believe that water washes our sins water does not wash away our sins water is only a symbol whereby you are symbolized or you are identified in the death and value and resurrection of jesus christ or about jesus christ so whatever john was doing was he was doing it in preparation mode for that which was going to come that's why acts 19 what did he tell them accidentally quickly now acts 19 what did he tell them what did paul tell those people john baptized yes it is true he baptized with the baptism of repentance uh-huh listen unto the people saying unto the people that they should believe in him hallelujah that they should believe on him which should come after him in other words jonah's gospel in itself was not enough to remit sins but he the bible says he was not that light but he did what he was bearing witness of the light i mean john chapter one he was preparing the way for the light to come he was bearing witness of that light and the light came only when jesus christ came so here he is telling them he was telling them to repent in pointing them to jesus he was telling them to repent in order for them to receive the remission of her of their sins which would come by the lamb of god which takes away here this is the one okay i'm still giving you more scriptures here all right okay luke chapter 1 verse 7 someone quickly chapter 1 verse 7 and another one open for me quickly luke 3 3. now someone read for me matthew 28 26 28 and it says for this is my blood of the new covenant okay wait a moment for this is the blood of the new testament which is shared for many for the remission of sins the blood of the what come on now are you with me the blood of the world of the new convent which means does it mean where was the old covenant please can someone answer because there is a if this is a new covenant and a new covenant that has blood there must be an old covenant which also had blood the blood of animals the blood of bulls and god's sheep and all oxen that was the blood of the old testament that the priests were using that was the only covenant the old testament we call it a testament is a covenant and there cannot be a testament without blind there cannot be a covenant without blind so we notice a year jesus is saying that now i am giving you of course he was now symbolizing it with the with the somebody speaking also his blood his blood would seal and make and establish the new covenant and the new covenant was oh this blood of the new covenant would be shared for many for the remission of sins now do you remember the other verse in the old testament which says there is no remission without the shading of blood oh you don't know it oh can you open it quickly quickly it's in hebrews 9 22. quickly someone please fast because this is not our subject for today and i do i want i don't i don't want us to be very behind in our study okay is someone giving me hebrews 9 22 yes hallelujah and everything by law almost is fighted with blood and without everybody wanted to go and without shading of blood there you you didn't hear what did he say brother kelly brother what brother solomon brother solomon what did the verse say without oh can you please tell him those of you had one two three go without without shedding of blood there is no remission the blood must be shed hallelujah oh my i feel like preaching right now blood must be shed without blood there is no remission of sins because life is in the blood hallelujah okay can i give you more or you're tired i told you that very many all right quickly now 24 luke 24 did i give it look 34. okay can you read read those which i gave you already hallelujah who would do that right in holiness and righteousness before you mean all the days of our life and thou child shall be called the prophet of the of the highest for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death and guide our feet into unto the way of peace read me the next one luke 3 3. and he came in two and he came into all the country about jenna preaching the baptism of the paintings for the remission of unless you have repented so john was giving them only this the first state okay okay luke 24 20 47 luke 24 47 amen and that repentance uh those of you if you don't want me to forget you those who are on zoom i would be happy if you put on your videos okay and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at hallelujah so can now can we now agree that it is his name that he washes our seeds yes can we say can you sing this song with me what can wash [Music] nothing bad [Music] oh [Applause] i know [Music] hallelujah acts 238 [Music] and another one acts 10 for the three then peter said unto every one them you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit don't interrupt we know you want to read it after but now listen he says what is your you are saying then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ foreign repentance then baptism then remission of sins then holy spirit now read that one first then we shall conclude this point yes jesus christ continue our finish up do him give all the prophets which means through his name hallelujah whosoever does what believes in him so these people in acts 19 did they believe on him yet no also did they receive the religion of sins no so we can now go back and count they had they be no before baptism come on people they had repented they had been baptized and they spoke to them so now the new message now which was coming through the apostles on the specific apostle paul it was now saying they must say remember paul was saying he must receive the holy ghost so that's why they even had to go back in the water because that water was now going to give up another form the first form was the form of repentance but this time it wasn't only repentance it was also the mission of and we have found a remission of sins is where in their name in their name that's why they had to go back again in the water otherwise if it was only praying for them to receive the holy ghost or to believe if it was only believing that jesus is rose again and they don't need to be baptized they will simply pray for them are you following me yes but they did not need to only pray for them they needed to tell them to go back in the water you read there read there again acts 19. this is amazing yeah sure you will ask that but let's first finish this point from uh from four yes you can read from there please who is that man in the camera huh we need this to be in as interactive as as possible all right someone just hear someone reading without knowing where they're coming from so don't think it's an angel okay all right go ahead hallelujah and then when they believe what happened when they had this they were baptized it doesn't even tell you that they believed because already that's a mask so which means some want to be baptized before believing don't even equality baptism you will be number one on hell on the doors over here water does not wash away you says ah me my sins were washed in the lake of victoria no water is water my brain my friend my brother what is what water is water but also blood is blood it is the blood that washes away our sins and the blood of jesus is the only thing that can wash away our sins and remember jesus was not only left on the cross for birds to eat him where did he go jesus was buried hallelujah okay brother henry sister johan please make sure you you always mute your audio at all times okay unless you're going to speak to us okay now what was i saying what was my point sorry water yes water doesn't wash our sins it is only the blood that washes our sins and only the blood of jesus christ that is why a you when you are you have believed in the lord jesus christ as your savior then you must believe that he died he was buried and rose again but that is just by faith only but it should also be put into works you know baptism is not is more of um a fulfillment of faith okay just like a the apostle i mean james says show me your faith without your wax and i will show you my face by my wax so then he believes you believe by being baptized in water that one when you have a place it says what it shows what many things that you believe but really it shows your faith in him and ensure that you believe in what come on it ensures you have believed in one [Music] god bless you this one has the point baptism is symbolic just like the lord is supper is also when we eat that bread and eat that wine it is symbolic what what what does it mean if we eat the bread his body right and the the the wine but you know those things are also symbolic the the the the body is here also right here the one and the wine is where the holy spirit right here hallelujah so we eat it every day but we also do those things as symbols so even baptism water baptism is a symbol it shows when you you go under the water that's why it should not be just reporting a little water here and then that's just they're playing around with you and then they're making you laugh and then cry and stuff like that okay that's i usually call it a child naming ceremony it is it is absurd that big people educated the people they go to school for i don't know how long only to come and play with children it is it is it is true because i'm not sure your version what a baptism is supposed to be a symbol a symbol of faith a symbol of the barrier and the resurrection of jesus christ so how then can someone be baptized when they have not believed how then can someone be baptized when they have not been baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ because that's the name they must believe in how then can someone be baptized if it is smaller water because remember it's the body you can they bother you and then the hand remain up all the leg remain up and then they only put water here and they say we have they put soil only here and now we say we have married so and so even a child will look at you and love that daddy you have married this one yeah i bought it and only as little soy is here on the forehead you know they will laugh even the children will laugh so this is how the angels if the angels were to laugh i think many people are giving angels laughter all through the day that you are baptized baptized baptism must be deep imagined by you because it's a sign that you have been buried with christ and you have when you come out it means you have resurrected with him amen amen john you you read it there in acts chapter where is it somebody romans chapter six these are verses you must you know it should be on your fingertips like this so that whatever you just go you can be able to defend what you believe or else you look like someone who has been indoctrinated romans chapter 6 you can read from verse 1. shall we continue shall we continue in his sin that grace may increase or abound or remain god forbid shall we there was a brother giving me scripture that is now sleeping uh-huh how shall we how shall we how shall we that are dead to unbelief live any longer there are in no you know that is so many of us as the baptist christ don't you know that as many of us who are baptized into the name of our lord jesus christ we are baptized into therefore by baptism wait a moment we are bothered with who with him jesus christ by baptism into death it is not about that john reading his sister so and so but these brothers are recording brother john oh you brother all right so okay we are bothered with him by baptism into death uh-huh that just as christ was raised of life hallelujah just like jesus was buried we are parents just like elasti amen so you know someone was like when i bought i went in ethiopia one day i baptized someone in water and when i brought them out and after everything and after we you know went out to the dress and everything then later uh they told me said a pastor that was so quick i thought i was going to stay there for some for some time so that all my sins can go away i say i said i said oh no i did not teach you that path it's not your the water that washes your sins to begin with that was in your mind taught by those people out there you know it is the blood of jesus washes away your sins what i'm doing here is a symbol only a symbol okay even if i do it for one second it's only a symbol just check you in water and out it's not by praying too much it's not by making you stay underwater for too much it's not but you understand it's as long as it's deep water whereby you can be buried and out sometimes i've even used bathtubs bathtubs in a place where there is completely no water you know we others we have used a big tank you know we got a big tank and then there is a lot of water we just go in there we use it the bubbles do not send natural running water the bible says much water okay john baptized in jordan and at some point he baptized in the river eno because there was mass water there all right so i i'm sure at that time they did not even have the technology of making drums and stuff like that you know uh perhaps so we know that the the issue is not like running water you know some people make a doctrine out of that okay the running water i know is always the best you know always the best but if you can't get it and it's not possible to get it that means you'll go to hell you have to find much water and then you have baptized in there praise the lord so we find out we go back to our point that those people you know we are already believers but they had a message a new message over another generation so when they had it they didn't say ah for you for us to leave us we already baptized in the name of or we have oppressed by john even if it is not in any name but the one the man who please jesus come to think of it he's the one who has baptized us so please please please excuse us they didn't say like that but they said they didn't also say that uh you know what we shall be counted under the generation of gods will believe with john but they say hey this is like we need to know we didn't know but now we are realizing it is the truth please can you take us now they baptized them again in the name of jesus christ and they received you have skipped they received the remission of their sins and they received them so if you have not been baptized in his name your sins are still on you my good lord if you were to die today you would die a sinner you say you believe on him right but your faith in him does not count if you cannot be baptized in his name hallelujah amen and you see you cannot also say ah but you you see i was baptized in his name but if you believe before them it has to be a conflict it has to be a faith and a confession of faith you have to know you are wrong you have to admit you are wrong you have to admit you are a sinner without understanding that's why you don't place babies or else you would say let me baptize my baby by the time she grows she will realize that she was about present she's no longer a sinner no it can't work it has to be another somebody who can hear like you believe like you understand like you then be battered in that water like you amen in the name of the lord jesus christ and remember not just jesus but the name of the lord jesus christ once you have baptized in that name then the remission of yours of your sins takes place how by the water the impact of the blood it you know your faith pulls the blood your faith and the blood they come together because your faith is shown by water baptism and that's why some people could even receive baptism of the holy spirit before what i want why because god had already seen their faith okay so it is the faith that gives you the holy ghost but the faith without works is even those ones who were already baptized before with the holocaust before water they had to go back again to show their faith okay so uh but your faith pulls down the impact of the blood and it's applied upon you and then you receive the holy ghost as a confirmation and a seal into the body of jesus christ so you see why it is very important to be able to baptize yes for the remission of sins and for them before the receiving of the holy ghost hallelujah so some of you are already baptized in that name uh uh you know if you die today i'm sorry to announce to you but the place you are going to i'm not sure what about it you know you must really know you must really know if you want to go to heaven if you want to meet jesus if you don't want to go to hell when i receive this revelation let me tell you me i was a priest's son i had already been baptized by sprinkling on the forehead and i was sure i was not heaven but when i received this understanding my good lord i i continually became restless until i told the people take me to the water now amen and i was taken that very day and i was buried in the name of our lord jesus christ and from that day i have felt good hallelujah oh father you may not tell me from that you must make any mistake oh i've made many mistakes but the more i make the mystics the more the grace of god is power outcome to me why because i am swimming in his blood hallelujah you are his and he is yours you know that song and i know i am his and i know he is mine what how does it stop i am my come and sing with me my i am marked now we're ready oh i am [Music] oh just i am everyone [Music] [Applause] by the spirit divine glory to god hallelujah amen i am his and i know he's my oh glory to god hallelujah amen i am he's a nightmare [Music] he's my you see now it's no longer i know i have heard of him but i know him you know we are we are in a relationship it becomes a love relationship it becomes a connection you know i don't know how many of you have ever had girlfriends of course before you believe that many raise up your hand only brother is very sincere all my people here are looking at me smiling oh my my my you people should be honest you are christians huh yes you are christians brother sister so look you know when you are in a relationship a love relationship you are like you are love struck hallelujah and you feel like them are you and the you are them so in this love relationship with jesus christ you feel like from the day you're baptized in his name you feel like you know him much better much better than anyone can ever tell you so people will not tell you any more about him but you now know him when you you you're not if you were a catholic before you have to go when you whenever you sin because you don't know him you have to run to a priest who supposedly supposed to know him but even him actually he doesn't know him so you run to him and he said holy father i have seen what can i say oh my son you have sinned again you have done that thing again yes holy father oh no problem my son what you are going to do just to go and pray mary mother of god 20 times then you come out man holy man the mother of god pray for us already the mother of good prayer holy mary mother of god we have sinned for us and then he said ah now i've been forgiven just because the man told you others they can even tell you go because you have done this thing very many times now my son my daughter huh go and get an arcade and beat yourself 30 times give yourself further strokes i one day i was in a therapy i found one woman she was kneeling before the picture of mary and she was giving herself strokes and all the back was almost having wounds what and you know this thing is elastic and so painful oh the devil is really putting this people in prison i tell you when you know jesus christ in the power of his might you are liberated and set free from all those things hallelujah when you sin you run to him oh daddy oh jesus christ i have done it again please have mercy he says don't worry my son you just feel his peace coming in your heart and taking over your life hallelujah this is what jesus christ does hallelujah when he comes in your life this is the purpose of this world that is why we are starting this one so we can know him okay so you those of you who have not yet known him it is your time because you know you may not have a lot of time now the end may come any time even if the end does not come you may die before the end and where would you go hey you don't know also you don't know where you will go after you die who knows where they will go glory land you think you are going to go to paradise there is oh my people some people think that they are going to go to paradise look paradise existed before jesus resurrected after he resurrected the believers go to the glory land hallelujah amen they believe paradise was a place a specific prison house where the believers were kept in hell but we thank god we're no longer going there ended the troubles cares all the storyline won't it be wonderful there come on join me now oh river the lord will be keeping us would it be wonderful can you give me that stanza won't it be won't it be one love for that having a finger joyously joyously singing with the hot bells or ringing would it be wonderful what then the fastener say that's the chorus yes that's the one i wanted when we the savior we enter the would it be oh joyously joyously singing without bells or ringing won't it be wonderful then hallelujah the brothers is giving me the words but they are not full you need to change a resolution bro hallelujah end of the troubles and cares of the storyline hallelujah all right now can we proceed i tell you when you talk about those things we just get carried away i would like us to find a place where we can i don't know are we just going to stop on the introduction today because there is something that came up and we discussed that someone was saying that when we don't go to heaven or rather when believers go into another age they believe the message of that age others were saying no even if they don't believe the message of that age they can go to heaven by believing they met their former message even when they're in another age and what i wanted to show you by acts 19 that these people believed but when they came into another age they also had to believe the message of that age also okay that's the standard operating procedure of god hallelujah that is the s of b of god yes then the rest those who are left over and those who will come in another age that's up to go to judge okay it's not yours my work is to tell everyone that without you believing the message of this age you are going nowhere in every generation god sent messengers with a message and their message was the only provided way of god for the people to escape judgment the judgment of god in that age like there is of noah i can continue on and on and on and on you see so even in our age we have received a message we call it the end time message it's almost sometimes we call it the message of the hour because in every hour there is a message and what is that message what how does it come almost 37 someone victory amos chapter 3 verse 7. almost chapter three verse seven show it to me quickly almost three seven what does it say in every age there must be a message but that means it doesn't just come from heaven and drop on the ground it doesn't come by angels with wings it also does not come by denominations or by church denominations no how does it come read it for me surely the lord will do nothing but he revealed surely the lord god will do nothing but that what does it do his secret unto his servant so if he doesn't reveal his secrets to the prophets there is nothing going to happen and no one will know nothing so if there is going to be a message in any age there must be a prophet center of god not prophets in our generation you notice how god works in every generation there has been one major prophet one major prophet one major prophet one major prophet you understand and that one major prophet by him all the others receive the inspiration it doesn't mean that that major prophet will preach everything in detail but he will throw the light in that generation and the other prophet or the other preachers in that generation will take it up and break it down for the people hallelujah so uh but of course by the inspiration of that prophet of the age hallelujah so now the reason why i wanted us to know this because we are now starting the church ages we have gone through the patmos vision we have gone through the revelation of jesus christ we now know about one god we now know about uh john and the message that came to him and everything god was using uh how god introduced himself to him and everything now we want to start to know how god was revealing himself to the edges how he came so we we now know that the ages are seven yes and these are edges like that's why it is called edges not churches ages of the same church because if you say seven churches like it says in the book of revelation people get confused it is not really seven churches because jesus has only one church but indeed here is one part i don't want you to miss these seven churches were surely physically there in asia minor even today some of those places some of those sites can be found here in the present-day turkey yes talk about the care talk about philadelphia talk about sardis talk about there's a common one here that they always talk about [Music] vegamos you know what else huh okay what else philadelphia we already talked about that brother you are not you're not attentive yeah sad is tatira pegamos all these church a churches like you see for example like today here in uganda namugungo give me blessings come on some of you can also bring kaimusi huh you can break a sumo huh you can bring a those of you in uaa you can also talk about sahaja yoga awaksa if you're in ethiopia at this abba you know this we have physical places okay these were physical places and these physical places were having churches so for example the church in a number of what i would say the church in namgoong the church in kaimusi the church in the church you understand the church in now all these churches were not there were very many in asia minor but the spirit of god only picked how many seven and left out all the others why yes my sisters yes all of them that is also one of the reasons we are able to know that these are gentile churches not jewish churches because they were among the gentiles people nations so uh one thing i want you to another thing i also want you to understand before we continue studying the details of the churches is that uh every church which was picked by the spirit was having certain characteristics was having some certain words that would be identified in the future ages to come for example the brother picked for us now they care all out this year and we have been able to find that like this as a city the people of that time there in laodicea lived like this the city was like this the physical futures you understand as you would read and find out in this book there were certain characteristics that were only in that place but also we are significant to the spiritual condition of the people in future age in another future age that's why the spirit of god picked that touch you understand he would go on picking churches depending on their characteristics of those places so you only pick seven because verse seven would be the only significant to the spirit of the spiritual realm about how the condition of the church of christ would be you know we need to understand this because one day i had a man he's here in uganda one of the big preachers here the first of preachers do you know what he's saying let me tell you he said the seven churches represent the seventh mazinga the seven continents and imagine them one africa another one asia another one europe another one north america another one south america south america another one australia another one antarctica are we done are we done seven continents and he said so those are the seven continents those are the seven churches and then and then and then he said also by the way without understanding and this man has many people following he has almost like 10 000 people in the church yes and when he was speaking these things people were shouting and i was like oh without understanding that's why we're the prophet that's why we need to act a prophet hallelujah then another thing he said now the angels let me tell you what the angels are can i tell you amen pastor tell us then they said the angels these are going to be seven men that god is going to send out of each continent he will send them to each of these continents one from africa one from asia one from andy they will be having powerful ministries you know when someone does not have a does not know that did not read it properly and is trying to answer an exam how they are they are fidgeting everywhere they don't know what is right and what is not right so you can say that is almost close to the pointer but also very far from the point another thing i wanted to know before you go into the church ages this book you see it it is the only book that brother banham allowed to be edited of all these messages all the messages you will ever read about the badapanam there is no message with the correct grammar are you hearing me amen even the seals there is no message with correct drama because it was a very very poorly educated person who is in 27 here grade 7 oh brother was about your education level but in english he was right no his english was very poor the truth of the matter is sister richard here has a better english than that of brother banner yes you are in english you are very very well very very well doing very well so the things of god are not revealed by education are you hearing me never think that you are going to go to a bible college to learn god that's why we don't go to bible college yeah yes that's why we want to go to the bible apostle paul to say the things that i teach you they are not from management they are not from managed wisdom what man teaches but it is from the spirit comparing spiritual with the spiritual hallelujah so we find out that the things that we are preaching in this message are not from school i'm not from many wisdom they're not philosophy these are facts i'm giving you about this so you can now know when you get into it another factor you should know is that he preached these summons all these summons every summon on the revelation of jesus christ on the patent vision efficient church age dismantling pegamos until the last and then these are also on tape they are available okay the ordering is preaching but he tasked one brother and his name i told you his name last time his name was leaving and he told him to edit because for him he was a theology and he was educated so he told him to edit and correct all the grammar and even some things he added which was not on the tips but abandoned added those things he would record him a voice and then the other one would do type it in there like on the serpent seed and other things which are also part of the teaching here but were not originally in the original trips so in other words this book now contains most of the teachings of the message because it was a compilation of all of those and it was edited to be grammatically good so that god is very wise he he knows how to get to even the highly educated yes when president said when he came to ethiopia when i was in ethiopia i was by god's grace connected i got connected to uh one brother who currently is the head of the peace and security council of the african union and they had a meeting at the african union so i asked him i said do you meet and can you will you be able to meet because they had the african head of state uh meeting so i said will you meet the president he said oh yeah sure i always meet himself and he's even sitting near me i said oh that's very good so i would like to give you this church edit book take it to him this brother is from togo and he is a believer of this message you know the believers of this message all over hallelujah so i gave him that book and i wrote for i i wrote within it i said dear sir i said something like that i said i'm here in ethiopia but i'm ugandan and i would like to give you this book please take time and read it and i i signed my name so i sent it to the presidential service now at the bottom again i said did you give it to him he said oh yeah you know we were very busy in the last session so and we are coming out i saw him standing somewhere so i was running to uh give it to him but he was also engaged with another head of state of course if he's engaged with another head of state it remains now this one now is a bit lower so he has to uh to wait and he was also running out of time so he said that then i gave it to one of his uh uh you know how they call it whatever so to and then he would he told me he would give it to him so i'm sure they did and even if he didn't give it to him whoever whatever he landed there were those alights and i'm sure when they did it it makes a lot of sense hallelujah you know here in a year here in our fellowship okay we might not be in our fellowship directly but one of the sisters here also works in the government and she did not know of this message out of about the banner and and uh she's a high ranking military officer but when she heard of it and she picked this book she told me she read this book finish it from cover to cover and when she left she said where has this thing been where has it been how come i never knew about it and she was attending graceland vega and the gracely vega is a preacher here in kampala but he is preaching his own thing but uh he takes some of those things from the message and preaches it to the people as his own messages but one day he happened to mention william branham by accident and the sister went and searched william and then she found people talking about it so she told them please send me this book so they sent it over this one and she read it and from that time she said she believed this message high ranking officer but when she came to me she said please take me and baptize me even i remember that place i took at lake guamala it was very very adapted even there were pigs on the and they are they you know made the whole place a mess and it had rained so but here is a this old woman she's saying she's a you know she left all her you know how they call it all asters behind those stones or whatever all her rants to be able to go in that market that thing to be baptized and i have a place today in the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah i'm still holding on to this message so god will call his own and this book is very important because if you study it then you will know many of the teachings of this message and that's another thing you need to know all right so that's why when you read it some words may be difficult for you especially in these latest chapters but if it is difficult for you to understand then as you are reading call your brother or your sister whoever you are with and then try to to chew it down if you can't chew it down then you wait until we have a meeting like this then we can be able to tweet down for you praise the lord yeah so now uh what else do you need to know before we get into this i i am in the introduction by the way i am in the introduction aha one more thing i think we are even going to close with this by now if there is no other thing because i see we are almost gone for two hours and something okay now uh another thing that you have to know about this book is a how did we come up with the names the specific names of the messengers of each church age and also how are we able to know the period the time that this one starts from here to this that ephesians begins from 53 to 170 and the messenger is poor samana 1701 and the message is iranians how are we able to know how many can answer this question and i'm sure you have read it is in the introduction right here in the introduction so most of you are discussing to me now you are going deep deep and yet the introduction you have not discussed it at all i expected you to discuss this about the political can you please put brother pollock up on video do i have to put him on video each time which i actually intended to ask you people so maybe someone could remind me what i had forgotten and now that you have reminded me i want to thank you god bless you there is a point he has brought which i had forgotten to mention and i would like to mention it another thing you need to know about this book that brother banham to come up with this teaching on the church ages because this is merely history most of it is history that's why those of you who had an instrument in school you really be bored while you are reading it how many hated easter you might be bored you might really because this is the history of the church okay this is the i can also another book i can give this one is a comprehensive history of the church but it is not only history it also includes the revelation of god for each age so don't only think you are reading a history book it is much better than history god bless you now now please let me not forget the point erased by the ban i'm read many books of unbiased why unbiased first of all can you people tell me the difference between biased and unbiased history but i told you to compare the two you are only giving me one side so compare and compare for me unbiased and vast history for the people history another narrative that they are promoting history but they are pushing something else yes gives you the facts for you to decide exactly hallelujah so are you following you are enjoying this so they they thank you for patiently waiting okay it seems i cannot see that microphone by the shame for some reason hello can you hear can you hear me can you hear me sister john now we had a problem with our network and uh so uh we went off but we just give it about 15 minutes and we conclude so what was my point before we went off no i had left that point so what was i talking about [Music] okay so here was the point i was getting to i was trying to tell you that uh he quoted many of them he refreshed me he said things that many others had already said and in this book you'll find things that probably some historians have said or things that are fractured in history and some of those people who have left who have no i will not even use the one left but i would use the one who have eventually after some time of thinking they understood the message their intellectual faith failed them and they said you have left their message in courts i said left because no one can leave the message when they're in the message can you is it possible so suddenly they have not been in the vessel before okay but they were only around the message okay so yes brother and we are concluding uh okay okay uh well we are concluding by the channel and um the recording of the someone will be on youtube so i'm sure you can be able to have it shared uh it will be on the youtube channel it's actually even now streaming on the youtube channel so you can be able to share it whoever you want to share it with if that will help you so now uh what was i saying yes they claimed how many are not plagiarism how many know what library means rogers okay brother you know who else knows you you know who else okay can you explain to us what according to your understanding your understanding what plagiarism is go ahead we can't hear you yet you have to admit he is going to bless you amen yes plagiarism is copying somebody's work and you can hope if somebody had a document you copied you'll make your own copy from another another somebody's document okay all right thank you so now uh the have you heard what it means copying what someone else has done and calling it your own now this is the allegation that these people get to brother and they said brother barnum plagiarized the other people's work and courtesy called it his own are you understanding yes but now that we are in a youth bible study you will hear this thing at one point in your crucial journey and you must hear it from a good authority and i will tell you this personally i believe by the parlam to be a message of this generation because god has confirmed it to me in many ways right all right don't look at me as if you don't believe me i'm sure you believe it too but what these people are saying is unfounded it is not true because brother himself has stated very well until that the things he was speaking the history the historic part of it that he was saying was taken from other people's work meaning writings it was facts it was things which it started it was things which he heard others say and it was true from the unbiased historians and bible teachers and whatever you're going to call it but those historians also there were parts when it comes to the regulation part where they will go wrong as a prophet of malachi 4 what was his what as a prophet of malachi for his what was to fold please please hear me now this is very very important because we will conclude with this his what was twofold the first purpose of the first part of his work was as the prophet managed to do what someone told me please you and you are saying the same thing to try to answer them children to their fathers is the same as doing the work of destruction and another one would say so as a prophet malachi 4 he would also be the messenger the seventh angel messenger of revelation 10 and seven which says in the days of that voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of god will be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophet so he is if his ministry finishes the mystery of god so as the revelation of the mysteries like the suffering see the seven seas and other things and also it restores the truth back again to the church the truth which was already there told ready by the others but is bringing it back now throughout church the church ages this truth of god has been mad it has been mixed up here and there and you know all through the ages other messengers all these other messages we are saying something true but not entirely true in everything they say but it's not like i'll show you one of them martin luther [Music] yes he was at this time there was no other faith and luther was a priest in the catholic church but he protested against the catholic church for their false teachings yes which are the first doctrines and he protested against them because they told them that all the things that they they teach but he did not entirely have the revelation of all of them but what he had he had a document of 95 reasons why he is protesting against the catholic church when we come to that age which is the status i will read for you that faces of maternal ruler now you'll notice that material his idea or his revelation that the holy spirit gave him was one that they just shall live by faith alone in christ and not of what but it is their gift of god so he protested against the church which was saying whatever you do if you go against the church you go against god that's why they used to burn people because they thought they they went against the child so they went out against god so much protested against them but this same guy by press babies this man smoked he would preach and then go around and smoke don't look at me like that now i could not use a man like that yes god could because at that at that time that was the man with the highest revelation of the age they just relieved by faith god was only destroyed just a little bit just a little bit you know those songs also came during that time this video i don't mind i'm gonna let it shine this video light of mine i'm gonna let it shine this is the light of mine i'm gonna let it shine let it shine and that was shining at that time nevertheless he had the light but still in a very dim way and lightweight on increasing as time went by so the last messenger's work would be to run through all the work that has been abused and to come and give a final value you know the house has been built he will come in and say no this part is not good this was not good because remember the last day messenger is the one going to oversee the the completion of the building in this case the church he discussed the bride so that the owner christ can come and take her away so he was not going to come at the dude from scratch he was going to come and they fill in the pants which were left you understand that's why you take from what others have done then you would not know but this one was right but he went wrong but then yeah this one is right so that's why you would say i am current finished as long as calvinism is right you know what conversion is hallelujah can one person tell us what calvinism is please either come on now surprise us you can surprise us oh you would do good to surprise us yes yes brother marvin no don't you don't give a disclaimer just tell us what you do no problem feel free matter [Music] calvinism because it was a teaching by a preacher called john calvin and john calvin was a preacher at that time who came after martin luther and he preached in grace he preached grace he preached grace grace grace and when you're about to finish grace grace amen and grace you understand no matter what you do grace is there not a lot to do yes you know you're saved you understand so if they form the respitarian church you know what there is they believe they are saved as long as they believe jesus no matter what they do you can drink you can do it for the great young man you can do whatever you know your grace is covering right you understand so once you are saved yourself for good it sounds nice sir we have a preacher here who is preaching a form of communism in uganda some of you may know him i will not mention but the fact is that teaching has truth in it but not entirely because they go higher okay they they they believe the truth until they over believe it you understand and with everything every bible teaching there is a middle on their own shouldn't you go to the left or to the right and then there's another teaching the armenian teaching who says oh no it is by your words you are saved without your worship i won't be saved so in other words it's all about do do don't do don't do don't do don't and if you do you're going to have it but that's not also right because we are not said by our what it is by grace the gift of god so you can say it's all true but as if it's all not true so in other words where's the truth it's right in the middle of the road and the messenger of the nation by the banner was able to straighten that out for us and show us where we cannot reach and where we cannot go so in other words he was sent to us to balance the board yes so do not expect that whatever is here you will never find anywhere else but there are many things in here that you can never find anywhere else and those small things that are in here when you're reading this book especially if you already been a bible student or you're upgrading other books or other people when you read the challenge you are not really looking for those things for the many things you have already been knowing but you're looking for the little things that you never knew because those are the things that matter hallelujah so when you're reading this book read it prayerfully not just reading her they told us what you should finish give me something let me just finish uh i'm going to finish in one minute here don't read it like that really prayerfully because you need to click that revelation which is in the book not just the words the words are many and even men can speak it okay but you need to repeat that revelation which is found in this message praise the name of the lord so as i conclude as i do that you some of you may say will you even say i'm just concluding here i'll read for you a question because someone else will read first question let someone read can you open please the introduction to the effective chat agent we just finished with that okay uh sharon you want this book on play store i don't think you're going to find it as as uh by itself but you go to a play store and type in either there are two applications one application you

let me know if you're able to find it sister sister all you can post on there and i think you are also on the this is the channel on the youtube group yeah you're on the youtube group if you can't find it post on the youtube group and i'll send you the links okay who is reading okay please can you read that introduction yes exactly right there can you please yeah all right okay in order for you to fully understand the message of the chat hey jess i would like to explain the various principles that allow me to arrive at the names of the messages the length of the edges and other factors of all of them since this study was to be the most serious one i had ever undertaken up to this time i sought god for many days for the inspiration of the holy spirit you heard that part yes then only did i read the scriptures on the chart edges and delve into the many church histories written by the most unbiased historians that i could find god did not fail to answer my prayer for while i read the word and the historians and the histories i was enabled by the holy spirit to see and fold it to see unfolded a pattern that you see unfolded yes that runs through the centuries and right into this present last day so this pattern which that after this age and this one after this and then this one that pattern was not written anyway among these historians it was rather by the bottom by the help of the holy spirit was able to see this pattern and and then run run through this from the beginning to the end of the ages yes the key given me of the lord whereby i was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scripture one in fact it might be you want to miss this past sister why don't you come back okay he's talking about the key yes in fact it might be called the question of the bible if you are done it might be called what is it read it back it is the revelation that god never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is yes in hebrews 13 8 it says jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever hallelujah that's the key stone he used to determine all the the messengers that jesus christ never god never changes that is the cave stone what he did in the other age is doing in this one he's doing in the other one there was a continuity there was a what a continuity hallelujah brother can you can you skip a bit and go to another i'll start with the stanza i love singing another after the scriptures before that one can you read that if someone has got it [Music] please quickly someone [Music] the first you will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be attained apply that to that agent there it is hallelujah what you did at first you would have to keep on doing until it's done for the last time there will never be a change hallelujah oh my god talk about it apply that to the agents the the kind of man that god chose uh-huh the kind of one that watches for the first stage and how god manifested in that man's ministry would be the example for all other ages the kind of money choice and how god manifested himself in that manner's ministry yes that would be the example for all the other agents how did they choose him what kind of man was he that would be the same key that he would use for all the ones can you go down and read thus what the church was at pentecost is the standard down there that's what the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say god does not change that pattern what god did at the beginning was the one body that pentecost he has to keep on doing until they charge 80 schools those scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over don't you believe it such a statement is wrong on two accounts first of all it is wrong to suppose there aren't any more apostles just because the original two trailers are dead and of course an apostle means a sent one and there are many same ones today but they are called missionaries as long as men are being called and set forth with the word of life there is an apostolic going on hallelujah the promise of power okay come on proceed there secondly with the second point secondly they refer to an age of manifested holy ghost power as being over since the bible has been completed that is untrue there is not even one scripture that suggests that but many conclusively state otherwise here is our proof that both of these charges are false and we have already read that proof in our previous session now can you go to the promise of the power down after the scripture the promise of of power with which the apostles were included at pentecost is true is to you jews and to you your children jews and to all that are offered for off and to as many as the lord our god shall cause both jews not to do and death until he stops falling they pay the cost of message so we find out that this key shows us that uh this truth will not change that in believing in the up oh my god i think i'm going to keep this to another service to another time because i i see that i'm going to have a problem of covering this the way i want it because of now the time that is first spent you need to go back home it is already almost six uh but i wanted to show you also syria the introduction we need to really emphasize so much of the introduction because the others can you know just skip over over it and get the major media points but the introduction here is not only for the freshman church age but it's for the whole of the ages and so we did it even if next friday uh or when it was going to be tuesday yeah even if we still were on the chat ages and at least finish it but mainly focus on the introduction so can also be able to know now but let me read for you this other one of this before i conclude now out of this first key that we have received of the law there comes another and slightly less wonderful truth i say that the true church would always try to be like it was in a group of acts that is exactly right but we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there is a complete blackout of truth in the last day when the lord is about to appear so now in the age we are living in we are we we are aware that here we are almost at the time of full black out of the truth you know but we know that the truth of god in every church will continue what is it what's the key that jesus was the same yesterday okay that the true church will always believe that biology those things no longer happen it just happened among the disciples their true child would always believe in a living god then preachers will always believe in miracles signs and ones they will always believe in god who never fails god who is always the same yesterday and forever and i think that will bring you to our clause for today uh we can continue from that next week i'm sure that that was a blessing for us tonight was it not let us come to see why i'm so happy i've accepted that was full [Music] you see why i'm so happy [Music] god was [Music] [Music] i'd like us to sing that one more time and uh while we sing it i'd like one of you brothers to just uh uh you know volunteer come come right here and just pray and close ourselves services [Music] [Music] once again hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign thank you so much because you know jesus this one is going to change thank you so much for sharing lord world lord may you bless them jesus christ or father because there's nothing we do in vain god bless them for sacrifice that give you power please lord give your peace give them joy father i thank you so much yes hallelujah how many are happening tonight hallelujah oh my we need to sing a happy song which song [Music] [Music] of oh are open all the blessings are falling tonight in my heart [Applause] [Music] me [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh
