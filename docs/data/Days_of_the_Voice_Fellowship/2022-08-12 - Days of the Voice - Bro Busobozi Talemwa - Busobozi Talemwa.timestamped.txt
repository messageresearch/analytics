[4:56] it's been with a lot of sacrifices made
[4:58] by very many people
[5:02] those of you who just came and saw it
[5:04] for your first time
[5:24] there have been brothers who have come
[5:26] here
[5:27] and even spent nights here what do you
[5:29] have never seen
[5:32] i did not expect brother wang to have as
[5:35] much strength as he has this morning not
[5:51] you may be wondering what did they do
[5:52] exactly
[5:58] really
[6:00] uh
[6:00] you cannot understand
[6:02] whatever i know that god
[6:05] and all your sacrifice that you have
[6:07] made
[6:09] god says
[6:11] god understands
[6:13] see
[6:14] there was
[6:15] very low lighting here
[6:31] you see the brothers had to
[6:33] put more lighting
[6:39] moving all those people you can't even
[6:41] see them because they have they've
[6:42] gotten so perfect
[6:45] because they've been in your
[6:55] there's also been other brothers who
[6:57] came from other
[6:59] uh church
[7:13] you see all these curtains the carpeting
[7:16] cuppity
[7:19] the wallpaper everything
[7:23] some of you thought it was stones
[7:27] you know whatever you see here with your
[7:29] natural hair
[7:31] you know where you are seated look at
[7:32] around where you're going
[7:34] to the truth between the world today
[7:38] how does it look
[7:40] it's been sacrificed of somebody
[8:01] you see brother andrew holgan andrew who
[8:04] gave me the day he came here
[8:06] i think he was coming from some office
[8:08] or something
[8:10] he
[8:22] and also very smart
[8:32] i want to say we appreciate all these
[8:34] brothers
[8:37] could not even
[8:38] work
[9:07] not call me because you know about the
[9:09] shame who kind of ashamed but the shame
[9:12] was always around to make sure people
[9:14] have eaten sometimes
[9:18] also to do some work here
[9:29] uh
[9:31] you know and i don't know who i have
[9:33] forgotten that was really here
[9:46] and
[9:47] i think some others i might have skipped
[9:50] but god cannot skip yours
[9:54] praise the name of the lord
[9:56] so god has been so good to us
[10:00] um i do not have all the details i would
[10:02] have wanted
[10:21] we felt
[10:23] we felt that we had to do it this way
[10:25] why would it take
[10:27] a song
[10:29] so we've spent money
[10:32] a lot of money
[10:35] which we all including you are yet to
[10:37] pay
[10:39] yes
[10:42] this
[10:45] like i is
[10:46] i don't have all the details and i would
[10:47] not want to give you the half details
[10:56] but i'd like you to remember that and
[10:58] maybe on sunday i'll be able to give you
[11:00] all the details
[11:04] but maybe what i can say is i want to
[11:06] appreciate those who have
[11:08] cleared off their pledges that they made
[11:10] what's the rental for this place
[11:26] which was
[11:28] pledged
[11:31] and one million is due for payment
[11:37] and
[11:39] i believe that god will help you to
[11:40] fulfill those pledges
[11:46] so that we can continue to reach our
[11:48] attack
[11:52] i believe in worshipping god in spirit
[11:54] and in truth
[12:01] [Music]
[12:08] i also believe heaven is not that
[12:11] secret
[12:13] and if i'm going to heaven
[12:16] and i have a little heaven down here
[12:22] it should be portraying where i am going
[12:25] when the one you know
[12:28] so if someone can't if i bring someone
[12:30] to church
[12:32] when they say
[12:33] they're promising them of heaven
[12:47] they would not understand that the place
[12:49] i'm taking them too or that i'm
[12:51] promising them that the bible the word
[12:53] of god is promising them is really real
[13:03] brother was one day
[13:30] god is going to prosecute
[14:00] but i believe that children of god must
[14:02] not live in a sort of state
[14:09] because we worship a god who is more
[14:12] than enough
[14:17] you see what he has given you is not
[14:19] enough he's going to give you more yeah
[14:23] and what he has done for us is not
[14:24] enough he's going to bring more
[14:26] towards it
[14:28] i want to say this is just the beginning
[14:30] they're gonna come back to academy
[14:32] capitan dc

[14:35] went yes of course

[14:50] we are not blind
[14:52] we are not blind
[14:54] i can see
[14:55] and i know for sure the lord who called
[14:58] that cast on their tree is more than
[15:01] faithful
[15:03] i will lead us all the way oh
[15:06] the only thing he's requesting us to do
[15:08] to catch up to someone
[15:10] is to trust him

[48:17] inspiration
[48:33] i'm gonna get it and this young man i
[48:36] forget his name i think his name was joe
[48:38] yeah let me tell you when he asked a
[48:41] question
[48:43] and the question
[48:44] took us to revelation 10.
[48:56] and so i asked her brother isaac to take
[48:58] him through revelation 10.

[49:10] through the other young man through
[49:11] revelation 10.
[49:13] uganda
[49:25] and so as i had them talk i i got an
[49:28] inspiration to speak on this this
[49:30] morning
[49:37] everybody there
[49:40] is
[49:45] but in the days of the voice of the
[49:46] seventh angel
[49:48] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[49:50] of god should be finished as he has
[49:53] declared unto his servants the prophets
[50:24] may the lord bless us this morning may
[50:26] be seated
[50:34] before i forget on thursday the lord
[50:36] willing i'll be traveling through
[50:38] karamoja
[51:20] when i understood that he was in a
[51:23] critical condition i asked i was trying
[51:25] to find out if another brother could be
[51:27] able to take up his responsibility and
[51:29] complete those two last chapters
[51:43] underwent the operation but
[51:45] while he was on the hospital bed
[51:55] he told me please do not give those
[51:57] chapters to anyone remember i want to
[51:59] translate them myself
[52:16] the month of uh july
[52:18] we said he did
[52:20] finish those two last chapters
[52:24] and he also proved several messages
[52:26] which others had done
[52:31] a work that he has never done before
[52:33] the quantity of work he did i was
[52:35] actually even impressed i was about to
[52:36] call him and ask him how did you do all
[52:38] this
[52:42] singing
[52:55] so he asked one of the people uh
[52:58] brothers to take him to the hospital
[53:02] um and and
[53:04] while there that very morning he passed
[53:06] away
[53:08] again so i want to say he really went
[53:11] very well
[53:27] barrio was uh on
[53:30] yesterday actually yes he dwight joe
[53:33] i'm not
[53:34] sure whether he was buried i've not had
[53:36] the latest but i know that the barrio
[53:38] funeral service was could be yesterday

[56:15] service in this place
[56:18] what you know and so
[56:20] don't create a bad impression
[56:24] for the devil
[56:27] stand you know first impression it
[56:28] usually matters
[56:33] if the devil thinks ah this is a sucker
[56:35] like this
[56:41] that is where i will always go so don't
[56:44] be cold
[56:46] you know sometimes i realize when the
[56:48] preacher is not preaching and but
[56:49] teaching getting into
[56:51] people
[56:56] what
[57:25] of the voice fellowship
[57:27] and
[57:28] i think the verse we have read today is
[57:30] the reason why
[57:37] and today what i'm speaking on
[57:51] now
[57:51] we have read the verse
[57:55] it says but in the days of the voice
[58:02] yeah please put it up for us but in the
[58:04] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[58:06] named
[58:21] catch right away
[58:22] which was a
[58:24] mystery rooney charichama and it will
[58:27] continue to be a mystery era
[58:30] until the days of the voice
[58:51] we need to receive the voice at the
[58:52] moment situation
[58:54] i need to know the voice say it's a good
[58:56] demonic we need to hear the voice
[58:58] because without that it doesn't matter
[59:01] we
[59:02] blind not know god to man
[59:03] obama but are
[59:06] praise the name of the lord come here
[59:09] the worst situation that has ever been
[59:11] on earth a man just since there will be
[59:14] a river
[59:16] is for someone to be blind and they
[59:18] don't know
[59:22] someone who is blind but they think they
[59:24] can see
[59:27] someone who is deaf but i think they can
[59:29] hear
[59:45] caddy and they would read out of the
[59:46] book of isaiah and others
[59:50] unto us
[59:52] anything a son is born a child is given
[59:55] oman actually
[59:56] the government will be upon his
[59:57] shoulders
[1:00:13] that
[1:00:14] they turned to jesus
[1:00:16] and they said
[1:00:18] you are
[1:00:20] wait
[1:00:22] a minute
[1:00:25] you hear that
[1:00:26] you
[1:00:27] the scripture they read hey when they
[1:00:30] came
[1:00:31] speaking about him
[1:00:36] but they called him
[1:00:40] after reading
[1:00:53] when he appeared before them we all
[1:00:56] become a sugar they did not see him
[1:01:00] they did not recognize him
[1:01:02] together because they were not
[1:01:05] sensitive to the spiritual things
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:35] how can you say our father is the devil
[1:01:38] [Music]
[1:01:40] okay
[1:01:42] do you know we are the children of
[1:01:43] abraham permanently by the bible and the
[1:01:45] promise was given to the seed of abraham
[1:01:48] next tuesday when saturday and
[1:02:04] but they also were blind never mind
[1:02:07] that here the promise was not to the
[1:02:10] natural seed of abraham
[1:02:17] the real promise
[1:02:19] checkdown was to the royal seed of
[1:02:21] abraham
[1:02:24] satan
[1:02:25] yeah he blamed the darkness
[1:02:27] of abraham
[1:02:32] jesus was the promised seed
[1:02:35] yes
[1:02:38] in the book of genesis
[1:02:40] he was the one the seed of the woman
[1:02:44] and when he appeared on us
[1:02:46] he was the one supposed to possess the
[1:02:48] gate of his enemies
[1:02:52] and that is why
[1:02:55] jesus breathed the head of the serpent
[1:02:57] yes we are returning to mutual minnesota
[1:02:59] but no other could anymore
[1:03:02] how could jesus even do that yes yes
[1:03:05] because it was the sea that was promised
[1:03:07] to come
[1:03:11] but when he came among his own
[1:03:14] they
[1:03:26] because jesus is the same yesterday
