up in the world and many things hit me there one day God took a hold of me and he showed me what you people have and it's what has made me what I done lots of things in the world that I would not make me to be worthy to be a minister but Paul said I thank my God who counted me faithful putting me into the ministry if we are to minister it is by the grace of God because who are we we are nothing but the grace of God I am standing here by a gift that God gave as he gave unto all men some Apostles prophets evangelist and teachers and many other gifts prophesying and T Accord the Bible says in Ephesians 4:16 from whom the body fitly joined [Music] together and compacted by that which every joint supplies we are part of one we are one body different members and Paul says this body is fly joined together and it is compacted by that which every joint supplies exactly that which joins the body together f and compacts the body is what I Supply what he supplies and what you supp that's

words it is 11:44 I will use just 1 hour and 30 minutes I pray God keeps me that Luke chapter 9 verse [Music] 57-62 verse 57- 62 the Bible says and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him Lord I will follow thee with soever thou goest and Jesus said unto him Foles have holes and the bodies of the air have nests but the son of man has not where to lay his head and he said unto another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father Jesus said unto him let the dead bu their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of God and another also said Lord I will follow thee but let me first go be them fairwell which are at home at my house Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God look fore amen may God add the blessing to the of his amen pleas take your seats out of the scriptures brother told us it gives us great consolation that one word from God when we share it among our soul it brings his presence by the reading of the scripture the presence of God comes down we have read here three kinds of people the first one comes and makes a confession to the Lord the Lord did not call him no it just came to pass it just came to pass and the man came to the Lord and said I will follow thee wherever you go I would follow you and Jesus had the statement he said the foxes have hores the birds of the have Nest but the son of man has not where to lay his are you ready to bear that you think you going to follow me and get where to lay your head and get all just good time he says even the FES are better than me he knew what was in the heart of that man and Jesus didn't say all right let us go he just went to another one and told another follow me but this one has made a confession this one has asked it why turn it to another and follow me you have not chosen me I have chosen but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father I want you to look at this this fellow has got excuses moreover and the Lord is calling him the other one had no excuses this one has excuses me I go first bu my father the Lord in on him let the dead bu their dead go thou and preach the kingdom of God why do you insist on this one that is giving [Music] excuses his ways are not your ways his wisdom is past finding out then the third one said unto him Lord I will follow you but let me first go and be them farewell which are at home at my house this is another kind of believer here Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the pl and looking back is fit for the kingdom in Exodus chter 14 verse 15 let me read this chapter this verse the Bible says and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore CEST thou unto me why are you crying unto me but is not recorded that Moses cried God looked in the heart of Moses said Moses why are you crying unto me speak to the children of Israel that they go forward no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God mes speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward don't just cry here go forward my subject is press on Press On don't stop and don't look back press on keep pressing on make sure you don't look back and don't stop as you pressing on don't stop anywhere and don't look back when God brings you out of something when he takes you out is he taking you somewhere he takes you out to take you in he doesn't take you out and leaves you there hungry but he takes you in somewhere that is in Jesus Christ in to to take your position in Christ when you set your foot on the joury you have started the journey when you set your foot to the journey be determined to get through count the cost before you start the channel Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ told us that count the cost because if you don't count the cost you are going to reach somewhere and they will laugh at you he started and has not been able to finish when he started testifying when I started testifying going here and there there is a certain man whose daugh i l to the Lord she was my boss actually the school was father those days after my oliv I was freelancing teaching and when I that to the Lord the father as a Catholic became bit and things like that and God gave her other parents but there's a time this man came to me and his daughter and he said that is just you are just excited two just excited after a little while disappear I said this man doesn't know what talking what disappointed me Believers I want say more details strong believers someone told me you might be just [Music] excited I went back home and I cried because I'm seeing the results and I first prayed and asked God you want me to go tell people it is a burden on me I went to one Elder I asked him what should I do something is pushing he said Let It Go I started and here comes another whom I ought to be learning from he's telling me I might be excited I cried I cried back I didn't say anything but I said God prove to him that you sent me and after his testimony changed and I remembered what I asked what am I saying when we start off to on the journey we ought to be determined to get through you count the cost you must know what it takes and if you are determined to get through I want to assure you that there is light at the end of the tunnel the victory comes to you the joy comes to you after you have suffered while Peter says he will settle you therefore when you start we sing the song I have started in Jesus and I'm going through so when you start Don't Stop Don't Look Back until you get there because when you start you are determined to go somewhere so make sure you make it there one sister gave me a test and she said when I was at the University I told myself this words

victories to win we know what we are doing brother we have lost the sincerity we just come to church and just sing communion just anyhow just anyhow you to be sober and mean whatever we are doing with the Lord help me to run in the rest brothers and sisters we sing that song and we say Lord lift me and let me stand by faith on Heaven a higher plan that which I found PL my feet on Higher Ground my heart has no desire to stay where doubts abound I have no desire to stay there but lift me a little higher a little higher I'm praying on I'm praying on as I onward bow pressing on I know I will get how do I know because God said I'll get there how sure are you that you get there Abraham say the Bible says PA he counted him faithful that promised children of Israel that chose when God had called them out there are some children of Israel of half of the tribe of man and the tribe of God and the Lites these are three tribes they chose when they reach Jordan they chose this a good land numbers 32 numb2 let us read the scure there the Bible says here brother BR told us teaches us by examples I don't want us to have a dry someon we have a dry meeting today and I preach a dry sermon I want the Life of Christ to come in your heart I want something to constrain you to con and say I will make it I want you to be taken into the SP to rise into Christ it's my prayer now the children of Rob just interpret amen the children of and the children of God had a very great mud of c and when they saw the land of Jaz and the land of Gilead that behold the place was a place for the children of God and the children of came and spto Moses and to the priest the priest the pastor and the prophets andto the PRS of the congregation to the leaders it's a place and and and and Beyond even the country which the Lord SM before the congregation of Israel land for C THS and thy servants have C so what so what where for they if we have found Grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy for a possession and bring us not over children but God the purpose of God was to take them Beyond across Jordan here are these tribes they saying This Land is good we can as well bite here and stay here and stop here and don't press on farther and don't go backward anyway but we can stay here don't take us beyond the children Moses said the children of God and to the children of shall your brethren go to and shall you sit here shall your brethren go to the prayer meeting and shall you sit here shall youren give shall you sit here shall they testify make and shall sit here shall they do this and you sit here and where for discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord has given thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh to see the land and when they went up the Valle of and saw the land they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them and the Lord anger the same time and he SW saying surely of the men that came up out of Egypt from 20 years old and upward see the land which I abrah ISAC and Jacob because they have not followed me the son of and the son of they have wor followed the Lord and the Lord is anger was K against Israel and he made them Wonder in the wilderness 40 years until all the generation that done evil in the sight of the Lord was consumed and behold you are risen up in your father's State and increase of sinful men an increase of to arent to increase to increase yet the fierce anger of the Lord towards Israel want to go forth you want to bring forth the the wrath of God the children of is well as it goes on and on they said well we shall go with them what we are going to do we are going to build the cities here for us and our children shall be here but we are going we the men the servants we are going to go with the children of is until they have got their possession then for we go back they stopped they they stopped before Jordan and they went they said we are staying here and when they went into Canan they fought yes gave possession to the children of Israel and for them they moved back and cross brothers and sister you find that Joshua 22 that's not what God had purposed for God had purposed them to go into can the land is Flowing with but they saw somewhere that it was good as the church today does well this is good we have Fellowship together just be there go beyond that well this is good you know Crossing Jordan sanctification entering Canan is the Bap of the Holy Ghost way we are Justified we are Justified let us be there isn't that wonderful it's wonderful it's not enough on until you get where the promise has stay isn't it impossible is impossible brothers and sisters that's the same way we do today we want to stop along somewhere we start something together you reach somewhere and you stop sometimes your behaviors our behaviors in the church is the reason why people don't come to church and that the greatest stumbling block is the people that confess and their life is what they confess s rise up from there I'm not condemning you I'm not judging I've come to tell you you can rise from there I want you to take it in your heart and determine it in yourself that I'll get there when I become a living episode word of all men that looks me sees Jesus in from man come forth the on Earth I long to be like you

I've lost my husband the sons are dead let me go back let me return because I have heard that God has blessed God vised his people let me return brother sister may come in the church but God will his people for the sake of the El in the church it was so in this end time that Calamity had come that when we heard the Lord visited his people we returned the Lord Jesus and the Bible says when the time to go back came fori the daughter is in law her daughter daughter is in law the Bible says chapter 1 verse 7 to8 wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and had two daughters inlaw with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah Andi said unto her her two daughters inlaw brother sister I want you to open your mind open your heart don't let any unbelief take another don't hind another just open your heart and the Lord what that which is Mir that which is Mir drink it that which is meat eat it the bone leave it I will I may throw something out of without

says like this he he preached this in 196 it was recorded on T2 he called it the kingsman Redeemer who is the Lord Jesus Christ he picked it The Book of Ruth there and he opened our eyes and we understood that we have a king and I want to qu something out of that1 what the of God he says and a type of the L one church that once started a type of the church that won't go all the way and you are the church an IND that want go all the way said that sounds pretty good so she kissed her mother inw and returned back again that's a type of the lever they had walked to a certain level certain distance but she CH to return that's a type of aever believe Jesus to be the Christ then turn around and go back into the things she came out of to the man that will take the way with the Lord desp then he turn around and he go back it's like a dog to it vomit and the H that once been washed Peter quoted Proverbs in second Peter 2 and he said they saw they saw the pig there has been once washed returns to water back in the the dog vomits eat the vomit again don't be that way if you been that way change from a pig to a l how can the things be things that are impossible with men with God he can change he can change he can change and make you a lamb the prophet says as the Bible said now she return back to our go many time we return to the gods of our beginning many time we return to we return to is talking to believer I will say this again never push someone to another it comes to you pass me it starts with you start with me Lord do that may maybe we got eyes of last after after the wrong thing we will back to Lasting again maybe we got ID of drinking IDs of smok of all kinds of idol and then [Music] professed turn again what a sad [Music] thing remember it never spoke her name no [Music] was spoking about no more she Ro she lost it all she was excommunicated because of her decision she chose the wrong way brothers and remember his wife in Luke 17 Jesus said that's the shortest it is not the shortest verse but it a full verse he said remember his wife she looked back and became a p of soul but God said don't do that you f you f when you start to look back you be discouraged when you start to look back you will be God brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt and they reached the Wilderness in the book of numbers 11 and 11 and 14 it says they started to last after evil things they mured against the Lord and [Music] Moses look here there's nothing but Deon but in egyp we had the Cucumbers the Gars the onions what a time we had there we had women there we had we were popular Fashion Stars we had money there what a good time we have but here with Moses it is only we want meat we want fish we want this we want Chen it is better be better if we remained in Egypt to die in the wilderness they had never known all the years they walked with the Lord s signs wonders and miracles they were never confed but he is Jehovah that supplies it's different walking with the message and becoming the message being under great anointing does not guarantee you that you are going to make it you must press on you must be determined as an individual in the book of Acts 7 38 and 42 and stepan is preaching he said they griefed L they sin against God and in their hearts theirs not on the out not on the confession not in the dressing in their hearts return back to other you may be dressed well dress like Bel sing like Bel like Bel but in your heart when you are the I want to tell you come back come back bring back your heart to the Lord why we don't see results in our lives it is your heart one preacher that I love they ask him how do you make it how do you launch into the deep he said besides the hard work praying in fasting doing all the sacrifices the condition of your heart Christianity is a condition of the sometimes when we think we are not worthy then in the Lord we are worthy sometimes we think what can I do just a l man just a person that can do something in the they returned back they could not press on they stopped and turned back we are together brothers and S we are together church I want you to be reverent and sincere with God change something today Lord renew me create me a clean right Spirit within don't ever deceive yourself that you can't be you you have you are full you don't need anymore you don't need a renewing you are deceiving yourself say there are preachers that become so reown until they think don't need to wait on the Lord no brother didn't do that bus doesn't do that he waits on the Lord the anointed Prophet anointed prophet of God he could F pray go away just for service why he wanted the spirit of God to come upon the people but the challenge the people don't wait upon the Lord us and he say it takes a St preacher and start up congregation they inspired words must be taken by the his preacher preached to the inspired person inspired the word of God Dell in your hearts in all wisdom

stopping here I'm not going back I'm pressing on with they reached Jordan the sons of the prophets stood up to see how are they going to cross how are you going to be separated how are you going to be separated from the things you love see things that have been binding all the world stands to see and El Elijah got his man the waters and they separated as Christ Smit the the sins and all things by his blood and sanc jic Sanic they cross we know the story that he said but now you have followed really what is it follow Jesus say son what do you ask because you followed then said Lord and that so
