[1:37:41] announcements and it is difficult to
[1:37:44] speak such details
[1:37:51] online because it's meant only for the
[1:37:56] church so we met and prayed over those
[1:38:01] things perhaps after the
[1:38:04] service um I have a moment and um try to
[1:38:09] give it to you in
[1:38:13] brief amen but uh in the short time that
[1:38:17] we were here

[1:38:36] still

[1:39:55] bit you know it all came from I got
[1:39:58] inspired from what pastor
[1:40:02] preached there's something you can do
[1:40:07] about so there's something we can do
[1:40:10] about amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:40:15] but this morning for a little while I
[1:40:17] want to speak to you on the message he
[1:40:19] leadth me
[1:40:25] tell your neighbor he Le
[1:40:32] me the steps of a good man are ordered
[1:40:35] by the
[1:40:36] [Applause]
[1:40:38] Lord I would like to speak about
[1:40:42] Jesus and what he does for those who
[1:40:45] believe in
[1:40:47] him Believers are not like the rest of
[1:40:51] the people in the world
[1:40:54] we are
[1:40:55] special we are a royal
[1:40:59] priesthood a president cannot come out
[1:41:02] from his um presidential
[1:41:06] Palace without a lead
[1:41:09] car will always be
[1:41:13] led a king cannot walk
[1:41:16] alone he will always be
[1:41:19] led how much more we who the Bible says
[1:41:23] we are Kings and we are
[1:41:26] priests we cannot walk
[1:41:29] alone we will always be
[1:41:31] L the the security Personnel always
[1:41:34] ensure the path is
[1:41:39] perfect and I want to say to you this
[1:41:41] morning if you're a child of
[1:41:44] God you know God will always ensure that
[1:41:46] your path is
[1:41:51] perfect he cannot lead you in the way of
[1:41:56] death he cannot lead us this far to
[1:41:59] leave
[1:42:01] us if it is God and it is him leading
[1:42:05] our
[1:42:06] lives he is leading Us in perfect
[1:42:11] path many times sometimes it looks like
[1:42:15] the path we
[1:42:16] headed by following
[1:42:19] Jesus is a path of loss
[1:42:23] it sounds sometimes and it looks like a
[1:42:25] path of
[1:42:28] impossibilities that's what God
[1:42:31] does to prove he is
[1:42:34] God God likes leading Us in path that
[1:42:37] man cannot even dare
[1:42:43] lead so that after he has taken us
[1:42:47] through he will not take the
[1:42:51] credit no man will take the credit
[1:42:54] God
[1:42:56] himself will be
[1:42:59] glorified God wants to be glorified in
[1:43:01] your
[1:43:03] life that is why he wants to lead
[1:43:07] you that is why he wants to guide
[1:43:10] you but many people don't want the
[1:43:12] leadership of
[1:43:13] God and the leadership of God can only
[1:43:16] be found in a place of
[1:43:19] prayer but I want to say this morning
[1:43:23] he leadth
[1:43:24] me and the Bible says the steps of a
[1:43:27] good
[1:43:28] man are ordered by the
[1:43:32] Lord they are ordered by the
[1:43:34] Lord they are led by the Lord he didn't
[1:43:38] say even the
[1:43:40] journey he said the
[1:43:43] steps that's why he told Israel every
[1:43:47] footstep is
[1:43:50] possession every step he leadth you even
[1:43:56] sometimes when you have thought that you
[1:43:58] are in your deepest of
[1:44:02] Valley he will lead you we sing a song
[1:44:06] that the love of
[1:44:07] God go the highest star and even goes to
[1:44:11] the lowest
[1:44:13] hell His Eye Is on the
[1:44:16] spir listen God cannot I want to show
[1:44:19] you a principle this
[1:44:21] morning God cannot
[1:44:24] lose his

[1:45:22] sin
[1:45:24] there was a time when you in your
[1:45:27] weakness deepest of
[1:45:29] hell you know what our anchor
[1:45:33] holds because our anchor is in
[1:45:36] Christ by the way if the devil knew
[1:45:40] that he would stop tempting God's
[1:45:44] children because he cannot lose
[1:45:48] this amen there is no amount of sin
[1:45:53] there is no amount of weakness there is
[1:45:55] no amount of wor there is no amount of
[1:45:58] demons can

[1:46:34] seed or when you bu itat under the
[1:46:37] soil you would think it is
[1:46:39] lost but that seed because it is
[1:46:43] seed it has a gam of
[1:46:46] life it cannot die
[1:46:49] forever when it dies and it decay
[1:46:54] then it
[1:46:57] germinates what am I saying sometimes
[1:47:01] the devil has wanted to BU some of
[1:47:04] you in some sins and also in some
[1:47:08] denominations but do you know what amen
[1:47:11] we are

[1:47:40] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah my my my
[1:47:44] my the steps of a good
[1:47:47] man ordered by the
[1:47:49] Lord and He delighted
[1:47:53] in his
[1:47:55] way God Delight in the
[1:47:57] way of a good
[1:48:00] man amen oh my your amens are very
[1:48:06] small though he
[1:48:09] fall I feel like preaching this
[1:48:14] morning though the righteous man
[1:48:18] fall the good man
[1:48:20] fall he shall not be utterly cast
[1:48:27] down why for the Lord upold
[1:48:32] him with his
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:36] hand Hallelujah I have been
[1:48:39] young and now I am old yet I've never
[1:48:43] seen the righteous for
[1:48:46] seconden I have never seen a wrers for
[1:48:49] second why are we rightous
[1:48:52] oh praise God why are we righteous
[1:48:57] listen to me this morning not because we
[1:48:59] are doing works of
[1:49:02] righteous although that is good but why
[1:49:05] are we
[1:49:06] righteous go back to Abraham the Bible
[1:49:09] says Abraham believed
[1:49:13] God he just believed
[1:49:15] God counted to
[1:49:18] him for
[1:49:20] righteousness so in other words a
[1:49:23] Believer is
[1:49:24] right he that believes the
[1:49:27] word by faith you are
[1:49:31] righteous now when you believe the
[1:49:34] word you know God puts the vitamin in
[1:49:38] you to become
[1:49:42] righteous by faith before you did a a
[1:49:46] work good or
[1:49:49] bad are you hearing me before you did
[1:49:52] any or good
[1:49:54] thing you became
[1:49:56] righteous by believing the
[1:50:00] word oh you are not understanding that's
[1:50:03] why the Bible say he that is born of
[1:50:06] God cannot
[1:50:09] see and listen and he explains it and he
[1:50:13] says why because his seed remains in
[1:50:18] him he cannot
[1:50:20] s it is impossible
[1:50:24] for the righteous to
[1:50:25] sin it is impossible for the righteous
[1:50:29] to fall
[1:50:31] utterly it is
[1:50:34] impossible now when you
[1:50:36] believe the word you receive the power
[1:50:39] of the
[1:50:40] world which is the power of the holy
[1:50:44] spirit that is the power that now makes
[1:50:48] you amen do the works of righteousness
[1:50:53] now those are not your
[1:50:55] works the Bible oh my good Lord the
[1:50:58] Bible says our works of
[1:51:02] righteousness as filthy rugs before
[1:51:07] God so you know so he doesn't want
[1:51:10] it but there are some other works he
[1:51:13] wants he wants his own
[1:51:18] works his works are perfect in US
[1:51:23] amen when we receive the power of the
[1:51:24] Holy
[1:51:25] Spirit then we begin doing his
[1:51:29] work we begin living his
[1:51:32] life that's why the Bible says amen I am
[1:51:36] dead I am dead and the life that I now
[1:51:41] live amen he says it is by the
[1:51:45] faith all the Son of
[1:51:48] God not the faith in the son
[1:51:55] oh my you people enjoying the word this
[1:51:57] morning not by faith in the Son of
[1:52:01] God but by can we read it now this
[1:52:05] morning my God let me just let me just
[1:52:08] get to the
[1:52:09] scripture because that's
[1:52:12] wonderful praise the name of the
[1:52:15] Lord hallelujah Galatians Chapter
[1:52:20] 2 vers 20
[1:52:22] I am crucified with
[1:52:25] Christ nevertheless I
[1:52:27] live yet not I but Christ liveth in
[1:52:37] me are you
[1:52:39] there okay if you can't find it in your
[1:52:41] Bible look on the
[1:52:43] screen and I want you to follow me
[1:52:45] closely I am
[1:52:47] crucified everybody say I am crucified
[1:52:50] with Christ
[1:52:53] nevertheless I
[1:52:56] live I
[1:52:58] live no no he says I
[1:53:02] live but yet not
[1:53:05] I I live yet not
[1:53:11] I are you getting it I live yet not I
[1:53:17] but Christ live in me
[1:53:22] and the life which I now
[1:53:26] live in the
[1:53:29] flesh I
[1:53:31] live by the faith of the Son of
[1:53:38] God not by faith my faith in the
[1:53:44] son it is oh my good Lord I don't live
[1:53:47] by my
[1:53:49] faith the Bible says that just shall
[1:53:51] live by faith
[1:53:54] with faith not their
[1:53:57] faith your faith can do
[1:54:00] anything it is by the
[1:54:03] faith of the Son of
[1:54:07] God it's by the faith of
[1:54:10] Jesus so imagine you know he is in
[1:54:14] you and he's believing his
[1:54:16] word he is in you is doing his work it
[1:54:21] is the faith of the
[1:54:25] who loved me and gave himself for
[1:54:29] me that's why when you receive the Holy
[1:54:32] Spirit there are certain things you can
[1:54:34] no longer
[1:54:36] do because the because he is in
[1:54:39] you living his
[1:54:42] life in you and is leading
[1:54:47] you now can you be
[1:54:49] lost when he's leading you
[1:54:53] I ask you can you be
[1:54:55] lost we cannot be
[1:54:57] lost if he's leading us and he says I
[1:55:02] I've never seen the righteous
[1:55:05] for remember who is the
[1:55:09] righteous the believer in the
[1:55:13] word know his seed begging
[1:55:16] bread he is ever
[1:55:20] merciful and lth
[1:55:23] and his seed is
[1:55:25] blessed you will never beg for
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:30] bread I have always believed that upon
[1:55:33] my
[1:55:35] life and don't tell me this is
[1:55:37] Pentecostal
[1:55:40] approach in anywhere we are
[1:55:43] Pentecostals we are the real genuine
[1:55:46] pente so you should always learn by the
[1:55:49] way let me tell you if you want to enjoy
[1:55:51] the word
[1:55:53] you should not you should always learn
[1:55:54] to take the
[1:55:58] remas take it
[1:56:00] personally hear the word of God for
[1:56:03] you don't just hear the Bible being
[1:56:07] read when I read that will never beg for
[1:56:12] bread
[1:56:16] am so that's why I speak to you that you
[1:56:20] will never beg for prayer
[1:56:23] now when you believe it it is applied
[1:56:26] upon your
[1:56:28] life amen praise the name of the Lord so
[1:56:32] now Saints the way of the
[1:56:36] Lord the righteous Delight in
[1:56:40] it but the way of the Lord is not
[1:56:44] easy the way of the Lord is not
[1:56:51] Dy often
[1:56:53] hard
[1:56:55] squeezed difficult not
[1:56:59] popular when you receive and accept the
[1:57:01] way of the
[1:57:03] Lord because the way of the Lord is the
[1:57:05] way of the
[1:57:07] word either way let me tell you you can
[1:57:09] never accept the way of the
[1:57:12] Lord and you fail to make
[1:57:17] enemies because the way of the
[1:57:20] word is not popular
[1:57:24] many don't believe
[1:57:25] it many don't believe it many refuse it
[1:57:30] so when you accept it they begin to
[1:57:33] separate themselves from
[1:57:34] you many people struggle with worldly
[1:57:39] friends I can't leave
[1:57:41] them you don't need to leave
[1:57:44] anyone the only thing you need to do is
[1:57:48] to walk in the way of the
[1:57:50] Lord if you live in the way of the
[1:57:54] Lord those worldly
[1:57:56] friends will
[1:57:58] automatically dis Fellowship
[1:58:01] you if you take your
[1:58:04] stand and you say this is what I
[1:58:07] believe I am a young person but I don't
[1:58:11] CL I don't drink alcohol I don't keep no
[1:58:15] girlfriend
[1:58:17] boyfri I don't go to
[1:58:22] automatically you will make enemies with
[1:58:27] one but the problem with our younger
[1:58:30] generation they cannot take their
[1:58:35] stand but you see if you make a
[1:58:40] stand brother you will always be in the
[1:58:42] way of the
[1:58:44] Lord and the way of the Lord is
[1:58:47] perfect when you are in the way of the
[1:58:51] Lord he will begin leading
[1:58:54] you how many want to be Leed of
[1:58:57] the then he will begin leading
[1:59:00] you he will begin leading you in your
[1:59:04] marriage some of you who are
[1:59:06] married you should also walk in the way
[1:59:08] of the
[1:59:09] Lord amen what is the way of the Lord
[1:59:13] the position of a man and a
[1:59:17] woman stay in your
[1:59:19] place stay the Bible says man love your
[1:59:24] wife even as Christ
[1:59:27] loved church and he died for
[1:59:31] it so the man should love his
[1:59:34] wife to the extent that he's ready to
[1:59:37] die
[1:59:39] for amen
[1:59:41] Brothers you should love your
[1:59:44] wife if you are close to a married
[1:59:47] person tell them love your
[1:59:49] wife yes love her
[1:59:53] let not don't be overly you know like
[1:59:58] many people are
[2:00:00] angered and then they want to slap them
[2:00:05] if I was not a
[2:00:06] Believer I would have showed you that is
[2:00:09] not love imagine if Jesus was treating
[2:00:12] us like
[2:00:14] that the way of the law his man don't
[2:00:17] beat your
[2:00:20] wife but so you may not beat up with
[2:00:23] your
[2:00:24] hand but many of you message Believers
[2:00:26] are beating them with your
[2:00:30] words stop that if you do that you are
[2:00:34] not loving your wife
[2:00:37] amen love her that is the way of the
[2:00:41] Lord cherish her that is the way of the
[2:00:44] Lord show her love that is the way of
[2:00:48] the Lord walk in the way of the Lord
[2:00:52] will lead you all
[2:00:54] through amen same thing to you
[2:00:56] woman submit yourself to your
[2:01:00] husband now submission does not mean
[2:01:03] when you
[2:01:06] agree or when things are going
[2:01:09] well or when you have understood each
[2:01:12] other submission is
[2:01:16] humility you cannot submit to someone
[2:01:19] you do not honor
[2:01:23] when you honor someone then you are able
[2:01:26] to
[2:01:27] submit when you honor someone you
[2:01:30] reverse them you respect
[2:01:34] them even when they say something which
[2:01:37] you do not agree
[2:01:39] with and you feel you can't take your
[2:01:43] idea first
[2:01:45] submit then discussion can come
[2:01:48] after but these days they find women
[2:01:52] when instead of
[2:01:54] submitting the nose the mouth will be in
[2:01:56] the
[2:01:58] nose they become very angry very
[2:02:02] Grievous to them everything the man says
[2:02:04] is
[2:02:06] Grievous now when I'm preach these
[2:02:08] things I don't mean my wife is is like
[2:02:15] that but what I'm saying is simple to
[2:02:19] the married couples are you hearing me
[2:02:25] submission means
[2:02:29] humility humble
[2:02:33] yourself when you don't humble yourself
[2:02:36] you cannot
[2:02:38] submit when
[2:02:41] you how do we submit to the
[2:02:45] word sometimes we don't agree with what
[2:02:47] he
[2:02:49] say but because we are believers
[2:02:52] we humble ourselves is it the word yes
[2:02:57] okay I believe it let him have his way
[2:03:01] now that is working in the way of the
[2:03:04] Lord to you young men younger ladies
[2:03:08] same thing to walk in the way of the
[2:03:11] Lord you have to
[2:03:13] submit and when you walk in the way of
[2:03:15] the
[2:03:16] Lord then the Lord will lead
[2:03:19] you every step of
[2:03:23] way some people believe the word for the
[2:03:27] church
[2:03:29] only that is religious
[2:03:34] spirit let me give you a little pastoral
[2:03:36] message this
[2:03:39] morning receiving the word and applying
[2:03:43] it only for church and in
[2:03:46] church is a religious
[2:03:49] spirit you have to believe the
[2:03:52] word and apply it in every situation in
[2:03:56] your
[2:03:56] [Applause]
[2:03:59] life to the
[2:04:01] extent it will even control where you
[2:04:04] are renting
[2:04:08] from yes it will
[2:04:11] control you cannot go and rent 40 km
[2:04:15] away from
[2:04:17] church simply because your friends are
[2:04:20] there
[2:04:22] that is not the leadership of
[2:04:24] God the word should control
[2:04:26] you ask yourself what does the word say
[2:04:30] that do not forsake the assembling of
[2:04:32] yourselves
[2:04:34] together as the man of some
[2:04:37] is now if you go in 40
[2:04:42] km will you be able to Fellowship
[2:04:46] regularly if not then you better leave
[2:04:49] that place find another
[2:04:52] place find another place sometimes it
[2:04:57] even is even jobs there are some jobs
[2:05:00] Believers cannot
[2:05:02] take do you know that the world controls
[2:05:06] every
[2:05:08] aspect of your life and you find a
[2:05:11] Believer selling

[2:06:03] University the word should guide
[2:06:06] you even the university you are
[2:06:09] picking the word should guide you you
[2:06:13] find someone picking a very far
[2:06:14] University where there is even no
[2:06:15] Fellowship
[2:06:19] there and they are not even concerned
[2:06:21] and many of them of them go and back
[2:06:26] slide they back slide and then they get
[2:06:29] a in
[2:06:31] education what good is it to get all the
[2:06:35] world and you lose your
[2:06:38] soul Jesus should be number one in your
[2:06:43] life we are not going to be religious
[2:06:46] just we are going to be
[2:06:49] Believers we are going to walk in the
[2:06:51] way of
[2:06:52] Lord going to yield our to him so he can
[2:06:56] lead

[2:07:04] want him to lead my church I want him to
[2:07:07] lead my children in every decision I
[2:07:11] made I want him to lead
[2:07:14] me he leadth Us in the paths of
[2:07:20] righteousness and brother bam in the
[2:07:22] message birth pains he speaks
[2:07:25] about he speaks about the message which
[2:07:28] was given to
[2:07:30] him praise the Lord I think we have a
[2:07:33] problem with this monitor here and so
[2:07:36] this message was given to
[2:07:38] him and uh it was in a way of
[2:07:43] tongues and it was in
[2:07:46] French and someone came and um
[2:07:49] interpreted the French
[2:07:53] and uh I want to read these words to
[2:07:56] you this is the interpretation of those
[2:07:59] of that
[2:08:01] message because you have chosen the
[2:08:04] Narrow
[2:08:07] Path the hard
[2:08:10] way thou Hast walked of your own
[2:08:16] choosing thou has picked the correct and
[2:08:19] precise decision
[2:08:24] the correct and precise
[2:08:27] decision and it is my
[2:08:31] way because of this momentous
[2:08:36] decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits
[2:08:42] thee what a glorious decision thou Hast
[2:08:47] made this in
[2:08:50] itself is what
[2:08:52] is that which will give and make to come
[2:08:54] to pass the tremendous victory in love
[2:08:59] [Music]
[2:09:04] divine I said praise the name of the
[2:09:06] Lord Brother bam made this
[2:09:10] decision this is
[2:09:12] 1965 I think this message was given to
[2:09:14] him around 1963 or
[2:09:17] there we know by this time
[2:09:21] the people had left
[2:09:23] him many had left him because you
[2:09:26] remember brother bam had three pools in
[2:09:28] his
[2:09:30] ministry as I spoke to you this
[2:09:33] morning I'm giving you a pastoral
[2:09:36] message so I want you to keep
[2:09:42] focused I don't want to preach like an
[2:09:44] evangelist this
[2:09:46] morning what because I'm going to give
[2:09:48] you more details
[2:09:51] amen so you can eat and your soul can be
[2:09:55] fed and I want you to follow
[2:09:58] closely are you hearing Brother Sam and
[2:10:01] so brother Bram had three pools in his
[2:10:05] Min the first pull and now when I said
[2:10:08] pool it means a phase something that
[2:10:10] pulled people to his
[2:10:17] ministry and the first pool of his
[2:10:19] ministry
[2:10:21] was the the the
[2:10:24] healing the gift of
[2:10:26] healing miracles signs and wonders now
[2:10:30] this happened in the first phase
[2:10:32] of and as an evangelist traveled wild
[2:10:38] over people received him churches
[2:10:41] accepted
[2:10:42] him old preachers started working with
[2:10:47] him people like Lind
[2:10:52] I think this there was another man there
[2:10:54] there several of them and so they
[2:10:55] started working with him and you know he
[2:10:59] was beloved by
[2:11:00] everyone churches we are telling him
[2:11:02] come join
[2:11:03] us oh we shall support you you have a
[2:11:07] powerful gift he never joined anyone but
[2:11:11] still they received him to an extent one
[2:11:14] time in Canada you know the Oneness
[2:11:18] Pentecostal and the tarian Pentecostal
[2:11:22] they called him in the message I think I
[2:11:25] don't remember the probably God
[2:11:28] explained and so they they called him
[2:11:31] and they sat down with him and they were
[2:11:35] pulling each of
[2:11:36] them because they wanted him for the
[2:11:40] gift he had but now they had seen he was
[2:11:44] working with the
[2:11:46] tarian and working with the p with the
[2:11:49] Oneness
[2:11:51] same time so now they were pulling to
[2:11:54] have him on one
[2:11:56] side and they told him brother Bram you
[2:12:00] a good preacher you have a good gift but
[2:12:03] we want you to make your
[2:12:06] decision which side are you on are you
[2:12:09] on the trinitarian
[2:12:11] side or are you on the Pentecostal on
[2:12:14] the on on the one
[2:12:16] side and they sat down and they began to
[2:12:19] talk to each of them
[2:12:21] and he told them you know you you
[2:12:24] believe in three
[2:12:25] Gods I believe there is nothing like
[2:12:27] [Music]
[2:12:28] that but you the
[2:12:31] Oneness you
[2:12:33] baptized in in Jesus name he said I also
[2:12:37] don't believe
[2:12:38] that because Jesus is not only Jesus he
[2:12:43] is both
[2:12:44] Lord and also Christ so his full name is
[2:12:48] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:51] so he said I defer with both of
[2:12:54] you so both of you are wrong and I'm
[2:12:59] right praise the name of the Lord and so
[2:13:02] they were all
[2:13:03] perplexed so he never joined any of them
[2:13:07] he went around the world seven
[2:13:09] [Music]
[2:13:11] times and everywhere he went he was
[2:13:13] received by people in great
[2:13:17] numbers they believed and accepted his
[2:13:20] ministry many people like Oro
[2:13:24] Roberts um you know a and
[2:13:28] others they talked Billy Graham they
[2:13:31] talked positively about
[2:13:33] him they said he was a great man of God
[2:13:37] Torne even made a statement he said he
[2:13:40] saw
[2:13:41] Jesus walking in human flesh
[2:13:45] again that is
[2:13:48] St and many others spoke powerful
[2:13:52] they talked about brother bham as the
[2:13:54] most humble
[2:13:56] preacher they received him in the first
[2:13:59] pool of his
[2:14:01] ministry when it went to the second
[2:14:04] phase you know the designment of the
[2:14:06] people's
[2:14:08] hearts some started
[2:14:11] doubting they said it is mental
[2:14:15] telepathy on on Wednesday he talked
[2:14:17] about that he gave you a very good story
[2:14:20] about that
[2:14:21] and so many started walking
[2:14:23] away but because it was also having some
[2:14:26] Divine you know
[2:14:29] power and and all that you still had
[2:14:33] many
[2:14:34] following and then when his ministry
[2:14:37] reached the third
[2:14:40] pH or what we call the third
[2:14:43] pool that is now the opening of the
[2:14:47] word the preaching of the Mysteries
[2:14:51] the revelation of the
[2:14:53] seals the serpent seed
[2:14:56] teaching water baptism in Jesus
[2:14:58] name and and know women preachers and
[2:15:03] many of these things were now revealed
[2:15:05] and restored back to the
[2:15:07] church that's when you began to
[2:15:10] see people leaving him in great
[2:15:15] numbers he was
[2:15:18] secluded they divided themselves from
[2:15:20] him
[2:15:22] many did not give him a Pulpit to preach
[2:15:26] anymore because according to
[2:15:29] them the things he was teaching was
[2:15:31] against their
[2:15:34] churches and they refused to be with him
[2:15:37] anymore but you know what there was a
[2:15:41] group that believed everything he
[2:15:44] said because that group was also willing
[2:15:48] to follow the Bible Way
[2:15:53] the narrow
[2:15:55] way and that group was in
[2:15:59] Jefferson but not only in
[2:16:02] Jeffersonville that group is scattered
[2:16:04] all over the
[2:16:06] world God spoke to William
[2:16:09] Bram said record your
[2:16:12] messages it will be the food for my
[2:16:16] bride in the end
[2:16:19] time and see 50 something years
[2:16:24] later here we are believing the same
[2:16:28] message and I told you we are the fruit
[2:16:30] of his
[2:16:32] ministry the devil can debate with his
[2:16:36] message the devil cannot debate with the
[2:16:39] fruit of the
[2:16:42] message hallelujah hallelujah that is
[2:16:46] the third fold pattern
[2:16:50] over true
[2:16:52] Ministry we we looked at it the other
[2:16:54] time you know the you know the the man
[2:16:57] has to be true to the
[2:16:59] word speaking the word the truth that is
[2:17:03] how you know he's a true man of
[2:17:05] God number two his ministry has to have
[2:17:08] the manifestation and power of
[2:17:12] God signs wonders Mir Miracles happening
[2:17:16] the supernatural following his ministry
[2:17:20] that's the second
[2:17:21] fold pattern and the third fold
[2:17:25] pattern is the fruit of his
[2:17:29] ministry if someone says God has sent
[2:17:33] me to go and preach in um in in
[2:17:40] where and then brother
[2:17:42] Brian he comes here and gives us
[2:17:45] testimony and says God has sent me to go
[2:17:48] in it is all right brother
[2:17:52] we are going to support
[2:17:54] you and give you a right hand of
[2:17:57] Fellowship but when you
[2:17:59] go we we must S three
[2:18:03] things number one you must preach the
[2:18:06] true
[2:18:07] word you should not deviate from it
[2:18:10] number two God must come in your
[2:18:13] ministry with the signs and wonders and
[2:18:16] vindicate that he has called
[2:18:18] you and prove he is with
[2:18:22] through you know the supernatural
[2:18:27] manifestation and message Believers are
[2:18:29] living that
[2:18:31] out we believe in
[2:18:34] that that's why we believe in
[2:18:36] tongues we believe in in interpretation
[2:18:39] of times we believe in prophetic
[2:18:42] utterances we believe in superal Divine
[2:18:46] Healing we believe in these things
[2:18:49] because it comes behind the
[2:18:52] ministry God
[2:18:55] confirming I am behind this
[2:18:58] ministry we believe in it and we want to
[2:19:02] see it in our
[2:19:04] ministry a Ministry that does not have
[2:19:06] any
[2:19:08] of without missing my words is a false
[2:19:14] Ministry how can we be
[2:19:17] sure God is with you
[2:19:20] doesn't prove himself to be
[2:19:23] God praise the name of the
[2:19:25] Lord hallelujah hallelujah and so the
[2:19:29] third F
[2:19:31] pattern then we must also see if you
[2:19:33] come back after 5 Years
[2:19:38] brother and you been in
[2:19:42] preaching we are hearing things are
[2:19:45] happening and then you come back and
[2:19:48] then we tell you brother Brian now can
[2:19:51] we can you take us so we can see how
[2:19:54] much God has
[2:19:56] done and then by the time we reach there
[2:20:00] don't even find any
[2:20:02] soul and even the only soul that is
[2:20:05] there you made your
[2:20:10] wife we shall say brother Bri there is a
[2:20:14] problem here God never sent
[2:20:17] you so the fruit of a man is Ministry
[2:20:21] proves that is sent by
[2:20:25] God and I tell you what the devil canot
[2:20:29] debate with that
[2:20:33] proof and we are the
[2:20:36] fruit that God sent a prophet in our
[2:20:41] generation we here are not the only
[2:20:45] ones there are many others all over the
[2:20:48] world there are many in this
[2:20:51] City many churches that believe this

[2:21:04] world there are message

[2:21:12] of the
[2:21:14] world Amen we are all headed to
[2:21:18] heaven but we all preach the same

[2:23:23] country for a city who build
[2:23:28] and we are on our way to canan's
[2:23:33] land who is our leader he leaded
[2:23:37] us Jesus Christ the bishop of our
[2:23:43] scho hallelujah amen and our Prophet
[2:23:46] came down and he chose that hard path
[2:23:51] when he told these things which we now
[2:23:54] believe many separated from
[2:23:57] him in his Baptist Church they separated
[2:24:01] from him in the Pentecostal they
[2:24:04] separated from him and he remained
[2:24:08] alone but he never gave
[2:24:11] up and then one one
[2:24:15] person speaking in French in
[2:24:19] tongues you know tongues can be in a
[2:24:21] human language or an Angelic
[2:24:23] [Music]
[2:24:27] language I've seen before someone who
[2:24:29] didn't even know how to say one word in
[2:24:33] English that was in
[2:24:35] Ethiopia and when the anointing came
[2:24:38] down he began speaking in English
[2:24:42] prophesying to us I asked he knowl
[2:24:46] everything he was being interpreted
[2:24:48] for he said that he doesn't know English
[2:24:52] then we knew it was
[2:24:54] times God gave him
[2:24:56] times in the English
[2:24:58] language I say so here brother bam was
[2:25:01] spoken to in the French
[2:25:05] language and so and the interpretation
[2:25:08] was because you have chosen the Narrow
[2:25:12] Path the path of the
[2:25:14] word amen you two have chosen the
[2:25:19] narrow because you have chosen the nrow
[2:25:22] part I remember when I left my Anglican
[2:25:26] church and my mother you know you know
[2:25:29] disowned
[2:25:30] me it was very hard very difficult very
[2:25:36] hard but I'm so glad this morning I can
[2:25:39] say my mother is

[2:26:01] an
[2:26:03] path hard
[2:26:05] way this message is not
[2:26:09] easy some Pentecostal preachers they
[2:26:12] say rown men here we know
[2:26:15] them they know this message by the way
[2:26:18] they know it but one of them said he's
[2:26:22] quoted saying
[2:26:23] this if you preach this message you will
[2:26:27] become a poor
[2:26:28] man I don't want to be
[2:26:32] poor because if you tell women to remove
[2:26:36] their

[2:26:42] pants oh they will leave the church and
[2:26:45] you know who is in the church more than

[2:30:18] you amen am the way of the Lord has
[2:30:22] always been a narrow and hard
[2:30:27] way in anything in this
[2:30:29] life the easier path is not the one to
[2:30:35] take a decision should be made by every
[2:30:40] individual to take the narrow
[2:30:43] way I remember many times some years
[2:30:47] ago I don't know if the musicians can
[2:30:49] come or
[2:30:52] you know I had this
[2:30:54] inspiration after preaching a

[2:31:13] whether

[2:31:20] with
[2:31:21] truth
[2:31:24] everywh I need a
[2:31:27] change to walk in your
[2:31:30] [Music]

[2:33:00] morning
[2:33:02] amen that's our
[2:33:04] prayer that he will help us to walk and
[2:33:07] dwell in his
[2:33:09] presence that he may help us to walk the
[2:33:11] narrow
[2:33:12] way every day
[2:33:16] amen that's where we can find Mercy and
[2:33:18] Grace and love
[2:33:22] the Bible in Matthew 7:14 speaks of the
[2:33:25] narrow
[2:33:26] way and says because straight is the
[2:33:31] gap and narrow is the way which leadth
[2:33:35] into
[2:33:36] life and few there be that find
[2:33:39] it many people want to come and walk in
[2:33:42] this
[2:33:44] way and they want squeeze in their
[2:33:48] world the way is
[2:33:51] narrow let me tell you Brethren you
[2:33:54] cannot believe this
[2:33:56] message and walk in the life of the
[2:33:59] world and still have the world on
[2:34:04] you if you do or if you can do it it
[2:34:09] simply means you have not opened your
[2:34:11] heart to
[2:34:14] believe you remember we talked about
[2:34:16] three kinds of
[2:34:18] believers Believers nonbelievers and
[2:34:21] real real
[2:34:24] Believers and we saw that you know uh
[2:34:29] nonbelievers they will come in church
[2:34:32] when they hear the preaching of the word
[2:34:35] they will be offended at it they will be
[2:34:38] offended and they will walk
[2:34:40] away but we find there's another problem
[2:34:43] a
[2:34:44] group another group which is the real
[2:34:47] problem these are the make believers
[2:34:51] they linger they stay
[2:34:53] around for a very long time they behave
[2:34:57] like
[2:34:58] believers they look like Believers but
[2:35:01] they are waiting for an
[2:35:03] opportunity to sell out Christ they are
[2:35:07] the Judas of the
[2:35:08] group they will always sell out the
[2:35:11] gospel they will always betray the
[2:35:14] word but we have the genuine
[2:35:17] believer that why will believe it as
[2:35:19] long as the word said
[2:35:22] it and I believe I am a real
[2:35:26] genuine amen you can say that also to
[2:35:29] yourself remembering the Lord 1963 says
[2:35:32] who walks the right life with
[2:35:36] God who takes the straight and narrow
[2:35:40] way but what knows what to be
[2:35:42] misunderstood
[2:35:44] [Music]
[2:35:45] means and the prophet says I am
[2:35:48] misunderstood every person all you

[2:49:57] this
[2:50:00] side and let the Sheep go right over to
[2:50:05] the that is the nature of the

[2:50:47] atmosphere you you are by a sheep you
[2:50:50] are only being
[2:50:51] led and you always trust your
[2:50:55] Shepherd but in this case you're
[2:50:57] trusting a wrong

[2:51:57] willingness to be led by the
[2:52:03] Lord prise the Lord so the nature of the
[2:52:08] goat he will jump

[2:53:26] go and if a fellow doesn't know his
[2:53:31] Shepherd real
[2:53:34] well it is hard to tell the difference
[2:53:36] between the bleeding of God and over
[2:53:43] sheep they are whole lot
[2:53:47] alike nature of them proves what they
[2:53:53] are amen oh I'm so glad that David could
[2:53:57] say the Lord is my

[2:55:48] been preaching since I was 13
[2:55:51] years I've had people call me Pastor
[2:55:53] when they could give birth to
[2:55:57] me why they were not honoring me as a
[2:56:00] man I was simply a little boy but they
[2:56:04] were honoring the anointing of God upon
[2:56:06] my
[2:56:07] life what is that anointing the
[2:56:10] anointing that leads us to the
[2:56:13] world we are not men
[2:56:16] Pleasers we are not following
[2:56:19] blindly we are not following a
[2:56:22] system We are following the
[2:56:25] word he leadth
[2:56:28] me praise the name of the
[2:56:31] Lord and he says here you should watch
[2:56:34] also the kind of Shepherd we
[2:56:37] have sheep are funny little creatures in
[2:56:40] one
[2:56:42] way here is another thing we might learn
[2:56:45] of the ship tonight
[2:56:48] when the weather is real
[2:56:52] hot did you ever see
[2:56:55] sheep they won't
[2:56:58] separate they will not separate
[2:57:00] themselves when it's very
[2:57:04] hot and one be at one place and one at
[2:57:07] another
[2:57:10] no but Right In the Heat of the
[2:57:13] day the Sheep will stand
[2:57:17] together you know what they doing they
[2:57:20] are making shade one for the
[2:57:23] other they having
[2:57:25] Fellowship brother when things are hi

[2:57:34] Fellowship amen and would it be good if
[2:57:37] all God

[2:57:44] on they would all stand
[2:57:46] together when the fire are real
[2:57:49] hard and the heat is on and everything
[2:57:52] going on everywhere if all of God's
[2:57:55] leaders
[2:57:56] ship would just stand
[2:57:59] together we would have the
[2:58:02] coolness of the shed of each
[2:58:06] other the
[2:58:08] Comfort to lean upon each
[2:58:12] other
[2:58:14] amen amen leadership
[2:58:18] amen amen oh my that's why we say
[2:58:22] Amen we bleeding we are Sheep
[2:58:27] amen we are sheep of
[2:58:31] his and he leadth Us beside the Still
[2:58:36] Waters most times when the Lord leads
[2:58:40] us now listen we're going to take a
[2:58:42] corner here as we the
[2:58:45] climax so when the Lord leads us
[2:58:49] list he leads us into impossible
[2:58:56] situations do you know why for him to
[2:58:59] perform seemingly impossible
[2:59:09] things that's why David
[2:59:11] said even though I walk through the
[2:59:15] valley of The Shadow
[2:59:19] I fear no
[2:59:21] evil for thou art with
[2:59:24] me when you accept to walk the nrow
[2:59:27] way the next
[2:59:29] task is to trust
[2:59:35] God sometimes when you follow the the
[2:59:38] right
[2:59:40] path let me warn you now Things become a
[2:59:43] little tough
[2:59:45] sometimes even the money you were
[2:59:47] getting easily when you were in the
[2:59:48] wrong
[2:59:51] path sometimes it
[2:59:53] disappears when you decide to walk in
[2:59:55] the right
[2:59:56] PA many many times I've had people get
[3:00:00] baptized the right what
[3:00:03] baptism and after that soon after
[3:00:05] that Things become
[3:00:08] tough and then they get
[3:00:10] surprised Pastor I thought things are
[3:00:12] going to be
[3:00:14] better you told me behold all things are
[3:00:16] new
[3:00:18] things are very very
[3:00:21] bad and the devil begins to come on
[3:00:24] you you believe the
[3:00:27] wrong you in the wrong
[3:00:30] church that's why things are
[3:00:33] tough but many times when you follow the
[3:00:38] leadership of
[3:00:40] God it becomes
[3:00:43] tough it is a narrow
[3:00:48] you are instead of walking in the way of
[3:00:52] immorality you get
[3:00:54] married and then the devil tightens the
[3:00:59] nuts I thought it is
[3:01:03] easier it is more
[3:01:07] difficult but let me tell you
[3:01:10] church when you walk in the right way of
[3:01:12] the
[3:01:14] lord it's the time now to also add
[3:01:17] another task trust in the
[3:01:22] Lord trust in him to lead you all the
[3:01:28] way do not figure it

[3:02:13] us in you know referring to our land
[3:02:19] as a church and and these other things
[3:02:22] needs we have as a church and he said
