TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so uh we are looking at verses three to six between the summer boxes I thank my God upon every remembrance of you always in in every prayer of mine for you or making requests with joy Neighbors for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now um being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ you know [Music] um so I'm speaking to you tonight when I thought he shall accomplish it foreign on verses 6 in the Amplified he says convinced and confident of this very thing [Music] [Music] okay he says I'm convinced and confident of this very thing but he who has begun a good work in you will continue to perfect and complete it will continue to perfect and complete it is a h yeah that's a big trick in luganda Perfection you will continue to perfect and complete it is yes until the day of Jesus Christ the time of his return so I'm talking about he shall accomplish it is that whatever God begins finish it it does not leave it in the middle go through with it again but many times we as human beings can begin our work and because of one reason or the other questions we may not be able to accomplish so because of unforeseeable uh facts [Applause] you may start to build a house when you have a good salary when everything is going well and then you reach the middle somewhere and you realize you no longer have a job you cannot continue [Applause] and so is life many things in our life we don't get to complete many things you wake up one morning and say today I'm going to do ABCDEFG Channel and then by evening you realize you have only accomplished the two okay [Applause] maybe you put something for two years or three years or four years or five years [Applause] and they've been pushing it ahead ever since foreign foreign some of you are very powerful and very energetic and evangelism [Applause] somewhere you feel you begin to feel cold no longer want to do what you want doing before you know it is in every area of our life that we as human beings it is within us to give up it is within us to failure many times you've not come to church not because you could have or you were not it was not impossible for you to come and be said everything because of one thing you say well I'll go tomorrow maybe you wanted to go and take the message to someone and then you say well maybe I'll some brothers they said why do you push to tomorrow what you can do today it is always good to wait upon the Lord if you're praying and waiting upon the Lord for something that is all right but I believe for things that you are sure this is the mind of God the will of God the word of God I don't believe to pushing it for tomorrow when you can do it today is always the best [Applause] but now in us we fail many times we will accomplish our desires and we have been failures how many have not been failures have always accomplished everything they wanted everybody raise up your hands no one he has raised up their hands because you have accomplished a few command and many you found that you felt shot and even now you're beginning maybe to regret I wish I had done that I would have been here and that is the way of man we regret yourself when we failure we don't accomplish and we feel bad about it but I'll tell you why because as human beings we don't know tomorrow as human beings we see in a [Applause] in our image the devil [Applause] because God faulted don't think that when when the devil came in the garden and they lured the woman that God was shocked tell me am I saying cleared is that the devil doing that Michael what should we do no that's not good that's not our God our God saw it before it happens I said when it happened all the angels we are shocked was not moved because he knew what would happen and because they knew what would happen is foreign foreign hey he says my thoughts what are you thinking about yourself that's not what God is thinking [Laughter] hallelujah amen so I'm like this foreign oh praise the name of the Lord I [Music] value themselves depending on the value people put on them if people think you were a fool our children you begin to feel so bad and they begin to feel like we're a fool if people think of you as a bad person you start to feel that you're bad and that's why we always defend ourselves when someone imagine if you're walking on the road and someone says sister brother be sincere how can you say that I am not a fooling yourself but that is his thoughts it's not the thoughts of God you understand amen don't think of yourself the value people put on you foreignty that their thoughts are not God's souls and those are Services the thoughts of God are very different from you neither are you always my ways for as the heavens are higher than the Earth and my thoughts than your thoughts what are your thoughts about your life what are your thoughts about your success what about your success who are not your Victory but your success somebody throw the word to him if you get it if you don't get it just say it in English let us move on your thoughts are about your success you your thoughts about your children you see when we talk about success we're talking about success we are talking about you know moving from one level to another Texas but spiritually and physically according to the world if you're not highly educated remember there was someone new you don't have a very good paying job students you are not successful that's not the thoughts of God so the thoughts now because people think like that so you begin to think the way they think and you attribute your success to what people think success is always yearning for what people think they decided to um they decided to think they decided to say well their success was on was on the best of how many people they had how how big a following they had um and then and then also they say that uh how big the how how big and beautiful a building was because we have this number following our ministry because we have these many people and we have an auditorium that sits 20 000.1 and they said oh we have been successful God has blessed our denomination but thank God for the message the message of the hour was the thought of God he told us no it's not it's not out for your building it is how you believe the word of God if you believe
