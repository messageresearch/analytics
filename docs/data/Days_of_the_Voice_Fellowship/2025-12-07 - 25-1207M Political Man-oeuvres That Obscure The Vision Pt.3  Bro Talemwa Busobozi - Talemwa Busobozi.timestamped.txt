[1:24:59] Sister Veria Katherine from Sata.
[1:25:02] Can we see you? All right. God bless
[1:25:03] you.
[1:25:05] Sister Can Rose also from right over
[1:25:09] here. God bless you. Thank you for
[1:25:11] joining us this morning. And um we've
[1:25:15] also heard from sister by faith from
[1:25:18] Bujiri by faith and we've already prayed
[1:25:21] for a child
[1:25:23] streaming with us this morning. They're
[1:25:24] in the hospital.
[1:25:26] Trust that the Lord will move on that
[1:25:27] child's life
[1:25:30] and heal her.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then also we've had this
[1:25:32] morning from siza and family in
[1:25:36] Washington. There's a reason why I
[1:25:38] mentioned that because this sister has
[1:25:40] been like almost a part of us here
[1:25:44] and she washes if not all maybe some of
[1:25:47] most of us
[1:25:50] and um and uh we were blessed to meet
[1:25:52] her when we were there
[1:25:55] and I know that they might be watching
[1:25:57] the service as well. So we send our
[1:25:59] greetings.
[1:26:01] Amen. And also uh brother Clement
[1:26:05] from Kenya right over here. God bless
[1:26:08] you, sir. And I'll tell you something.
[1:26:11] You've heard my testimony. When I was
[1:26:13] and I always tell you when I was in
[1:26:14] Kenya,
[1:26:18] I came around and we were having a few
[1:26:19] brothers
[1:26:21] and I I then got burdened for my mother
[1:26:25] for to believe the message and then we
[1:26:27] started praying with those brothers. How
[1:26:29] many remember that testimony?
[1:26:32] And then when I came back to Campala, I
[1:26:34] found her in the church
[1:26:36] and and so I was in that brother's
[1:26:38] house.
[1:26:43] Uh brother brother Clement is a um a
[1:26:47] person I've known for many years. He has
[1:26:48] known me when I was still a boy. And
[1:26:52] we are happy to have him have you here.
[1:26:57] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. And also
[1:27:00] I'm happy to see sister Patricia here
[1:27:02] this morning.
[1:27:03] Amen. You know I talked to her last
[1:27:06] night and
[1:27:07] the wonderful testimony. You remember I
[1:27:09] asked you to pray for the cousin.
[1:27:13] Um they were in the hospital
[1:27:16] suffering from brain cancer
[1:27:18] but she told me that the operation went
[1:27:21] successful
[1:27:24] and uh they're recovering well.
[1:27:29] We want to say glory to God.
[1:27:32] Amen. So you can see I'm trying to hurry
[1:27:35] because there's quite a lot to cover
[1:27:36] this morning.
[1:27:39] Amen. I have two surprises for you this
[1:27:41] morning.
[1:27:43] Where are the brothers who sang that
[1:27:44] song? Brother Dan and brother
[1:27:53] and brother. Was it?
[1:27:56] Okay. Yeah.
[1:27:58] come here and prepare yourself.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; I would like to have all the leaders of
[1:28:04] the land fund
[1:28:07] groups
[1:28:10] to please come forward.
[1:28:13] All the seven groups.
[1:28:15] Let's try to make this quick. I know I
[1:28:17] never told you anything and all that,
[1:28:19] but
[1:28:22] we've done this together. Come and stand
[1:28:23] behind me.
[1:28:26] Most of them are sisters.
[1:28:29] Praise God.
[1:28:31] Hallelujah.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; This is a wonderful army. Sister Mary,
[1:28:36] come join them.
[1:28:38] You've been an assistant. Is there any
[1:28:40] other who as as an assistant of one of
[1:28:42] these?
[1:28:45] If your assistant is there, call them.
[1:28:50] Come close here. I want the camera to
[1:28:51] see.
[1:28:55] The others can even stand by
[1:29:01] we have a testimony want to tell the
[1:29:02] church tonight.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] you know, I went to um we we ag we we
[1:29:11] you know, found we've been praying for a
[1:29:12] long time
[1:29:14] and uh if my wife was not in the
[1:29:17] condition she's in, I would have also
[1:29:18] asked her to pray.
[1:29:23] You know, she's standing with me.
[1:29:27] Praise God. And so when we left the home
[1:29:30] fellowship,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; so we went to uh the other small little
[1:29:35] place we call a little shop always.
[1:29:40] And so the Holy Spirit just moved on my
[1:29:41] arm.
[1:29:43] At a time we were maybe about 30.
[1:29:47] So and then I told the people we need to
[1:29:49] buy land.
[1:29:51] First of all, I refused to rent in a
[1:29:53] school
[1:29:55] because I felt that these schools had a
[1:29:57] certain spirit
[1:30:00] that you go there, they tell you to pay
[1:30:02] 20,000 a month or 30,000 or 50,000
[1:30:07] and you realize
[1:30:11] I said no, I'm going to not go to
[1:30:15] we are going to go and rent and pay
[1:30:17] quite a considerable amount of money.
[1:30:22] Not because we had it, but because we
[1:30:25] had a big goal
[1:30:27] and uh and so we went and rented that
[1:30:29] place.
[1:30:30] At that time, we're paying 400,000
[1:30:32] shillings.
[1:30:34] We didn't have it.
[1:30:36] You know, I I just by faith paid about
[1:30:39] three or four months
[1:30:42] and then we started
[1:30:45] and then from that time the Lord started
[1:30:47] providing through the people that were
[1:30:48] coming.
[1:30:51] And uh you know those of you who are
[1:30:53] some of you are here most of you are
[1:30:54] here actually.
[1:30:56] And uh so then I announced
[1:31:00] being led of the Holy Spirit that we
[1:31:02] need to start collecting money to buy
[1:31:04] our own.
[1:31:07] And it was a big milestone, a big goal
[1:31:11] because we needed 150 million
[1:31:15] by that time. I think four or five years
[1:31:17] ago
[1:31:19] and and so we started collecting the
[1:31:21] money and
[1:31:23] we got I think about 30 something
[1:31:25] millions
[1:31:27] and then we the place became so small
[1:31:29] for us.
[1:31:32] We had to move here.
[1:31:34] We did a lot of renovations and lot of
[1:31:36] payments.
[1:31:38] So the money which was much became very
[1:31:44] and all of you all of us were
[1:31:46] discouraged.
[1:31:49] You remember how we were discouraged
[1:31:51] and so we decided for a few months
[1:31:54] nothing was happening
[1:31:57] but one time I was in my at that time of
[1:32:00] course the way we collected that money
[1:32:02] was pledges.
[1:32:05] You know people someone would pledge
[1:32:07] something and do it.
[1:32:09] But one time when I was in my little
[1:32:11] stud place
[1:32:14] and you know the Holy Spirit gripped me
[1:32:17] like but no we cannot let this vision
[1:32:19] die.
[1:32:21] It is possible. God is able to give us
[1:32:25] land of our own. Of course most of them
[1:32:28] younger children students no money.
[1:32:32] But if God wants to do something,
[1:32:35] you know, you do something in the
[1:32:38] direction God wants wants you to go.
[1:32:42] Then he will start from there.
[1:32:46] He came to Moses and he asked him, "What
[1:32:48] do you have?" He said, "A ro."
[1:32:52] He came to the woman who was crying and
[1:32:55] saying, "I have nothing."
[1:32:57] The prophet of God asked her, "What do
[1:32:59] you have?"
[1:33:00] She said, "I have a little oil.
[1:33:03] That's enough." He came to a widow
[1:33:06] woman,
[1:33:07] you know, the shunami and and she had
[1:33:10] nothing. But the prophet of God required
[1:33:14] a meal
[1:33:16] and a drink. And she had to give this by
[1:33:19] faith
[1:33:21] and God multiply. We We serve a God of
[1:33:24] multiplication.
[1:33:27] He he knows how to take a little and
[1:33:29] multiply.
[1:33:31] And so then he moved on my heart. And so
[1:33:34] we decided, you know, I came up and
[1:33:36] announced to the people what I had
[1:33:37] decided to do
[1:33:40] at a time, you know, we were, you know,
[1:33:42] about maybe 50, 60, 70 people.
[1:33:46] I can say maybe 50 people something. And
[1:33:48] so we made an announcement that we
[1:33:51] needed to start
[1:33:53] continue with our land fund.
[1:33:58] And the way we would do it, and forgive
[1:34:00] me for taking time, but this is
[1:34:02] important
[1:34:04] so that everyone can understand.
[1:34:07] And some of you who have not yet gotten
[1:34:08] board
[1:34:11] to do this with us. This is important
[1:34:13] for you to get the vision to catch the
[1:34:15] vision.
[1:34:17] And so I announced to the uh to you here
[1:34:21] that we are going to take the church
[1:34:24] and divide it into groups and each group
[1:34:28] would have a leader.
[1:34:30] So we we chose with you
[1:34:33] what the name of each group will be
[1:34:35] called
[1:34:37] and we decided that it will be called
[1:34:39] seven church age messengers
[1:34:43] from Paul to William.
[1:34:46] Those are the seven church age
[1:34:47] messengers.
[1:34:50] Put them up there, brother.
[1:34:53] Get that kind of picture if you can.
[1:34:56] And and so um so we we we said now
[1:34:59] everyone we wrote a papers
[1:35:03] and everyone picked at random
[1:35:06] and uh you found yourself in the group
[1:35:07] you are in now.
[1:35:11] I found myself in Martin Luther.
[1:35:14] You found yourself where?
[1:35:17] You found yourself where
[1:35:21] John
[1:35:25] Paul Martin
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; sorry Martin
[1:35:33] John
[1:35:37] and so these people have been steering
[1:35:39] the wheel for us
[1:35:42] and some of you don't like them anymore.
[1:35:46] because they call you and they tell you
[1:35:48] what are you giving this week
[1:35:51] and some of of the people
[1:35:57] and others have left the church
[1:36:00] because they felt the church was money
[1:36:02] minded
[1:36:05] because they they came from churches
[1:36:07] where they are used to the pastor or
[1:36:10] some people doing everything for them.
[1:36:16] But here at DVF, we believe no one is
[1:36:19] going to do anything for us.
[1:36:22] Each of us are going to do it together.
[1:36:26] We should not burden one person or two
[1:36:28] or three.
[1:36:31] I should have had a bigger amen from
[1:36:32] you.
[1:36:35] And so these ones have been driving them
[1:36:39] through misunderstandings, through
[1:36:41] whatever. They pressed forward.
[1:36:44] None of them came to me and told me we I
[1:36:48] want to give up.
[1:36:50] Can we give them a a very hot cup?
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Others have done more than others,
[1:36:59] but all of them have done something
[1:37:02] and together with you the congregation.
[1:37:06] Clap for yourselves.
[1:37:08] And we've had people that are not even
[1:37:10] members of the church here.
[1:37:13] that these people have recruited
[1:37:18] to contribute in their groups.
[1:37:21] Do we have um uh um Habert here this
[1:37:25] morning?
[1:37:28] All right. I would like you to stand,
[1:37:29] sir.
[1:37:32] No one on the camera. Our media
[1:37:34] department I'm going to fire you.
[1:37:39] So,
[1:37:41] this gentleman
[1:37:44] and you know I know he has accused me
[1:37:47] for picking on him like we did on the
[1:37:48] campus
[1:37:52] but you know in the sense of membership
[1:37:54] of being baptized and you know a
[1:37:56] believer he's not yet there
[1:38:02] but he told me he's not an unbeliever
[1:38:06] but here's what I want to say he's a
[1:38:09] friend of mine
[1:38:10] all the way from college. And so he's
[1:38:13] done a lot of work for us in the youth
[1:38:15] camp and many of the things he does it
[1:38:17] without being paid.
[1:38:23] The Lord the angels will clap for him
[1:38:26] and also
[1:38:28] you know he told me every month I'm
[1:38:32] going to deposit 60,000
[1:38:36] from one of the he has two groups.
[1:38:40] Because when he came in here to visit
[1:38:43] who who asked him
[1:38:45] Joel asked him which group is that Paul
[1:38:50] who put him in another group
[1:38:53] and also so both of them attacked him
[1:38:56] they said brother join our group and
[1:38:59] give us something. So he committed
[1:39:01] 60,000 every month
[1:39:04] to each of these groups.
[1:39:07] He's given two groups.
[1:39:10] The one you are considering not to be a
[1:39:12] member of your church
[1:39:14] yet.
[1:39:19] He said this is his church
[1:39:21] but not yet fully.
[1:39:25] We are claiming you in the name of Jesus
[1:39:26] Christ.
[1:39:28] But what am I saying? Some of you have
[1:39:31] done nothing.
[1:39:34] If you do nothing, God will raise people
[1:39:36] like brother.
[1:39:44] What I'm saying, God is able to do
[1:39:46] anything. And I want to say sir, God
[1:39:49] bless you so much for your support.
[1:39:52] We've had people like uh sister, what's
[1:39:55] the name of that?
[1:39:57] Sister,
[1:39:59] pastor Jess's wife. She's given some
[1:40:02] like a lot of money. I don't want to
[1:40:05] mess up the figure, but she's given a
[1:40:06] lot of money.
[1:40:09] Every now and then, she even pledged.
[1:40:12] She fulfills her pledge.
[1:40:14] We've had people like Sister Lisa, the
[1:40:16] one I mentioned
[1:40:18] over I think about two years. every now
[1:40:21] and then she would send in something and
[1:40:23] we were always announcing it on the on
[1:40:26] the for the land fund and different uh
[1:40:30] who did you recruit? Who was this?
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Sorry,
[1:40:35] Mr. Pastor Gideon.
[1:40:38] She recruited him in that group.
[1:40:41] She's a woman of valor.
[1:40:43] She went to him and and and and told
[1:40:45] him, "Pastor, we are collecting money in
[1:40:47] our church to buy land.
[1:40:52] He gives her money every week.
[1:40:55] Every week.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Yet they also have projects in their
[1:41:00] church.
[1:41:03] Make sure I don't forget any of your
[1:41:06] sister
[1:41:08] from Sweden.
[1:41:10] That's I didn't even know about her.
[1:41:13] The sister get recruited her and she's
[1:41:16] been giving. Is it weekly or every now
[1:41:18] and then?
[1:41:19] every once in a while she's been giving
[1:41:21] something. I say we appreciate that.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; We appreciate that.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; And uh who else has somebody that you
[1:41:29] you want me not to forget?
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Sister Dina. Oh yeah. Sister Dina from
[1:41:33] Boston.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; She's a member here but moved there and
[1:41:37] and
[1:41:39] so she's been also giving regularly
[1:41:41] every week.
[1:41:45] Friends, this is what I'm talking about.
[1:41:49] When you lay down the vision
[1:41:53] and some people catch the vision,
[1:41:56] God always brings it to pass.
[1:41:59] If you don't catch the vision, God will
[1:42:01] raise somebody else.
[1:42:06] And so we started collecting that money.
[1:42:10] And now time came last year. Was it this
[1:42:14] early this year?
[1:42:15] We used over 30 million shillings in the
[1:42:17] in the in the in the youth camp.
[1:42:21] We've had a lot of setbacks
[1:42:24] and all the money
[1:42:28] and we needed to pay 100 million.
[1:42:32] But let me tell you, God moved
[1:42:36] and we raised that money in not less
[1:42:38] than three, I think was it three, two,
[1:42:41] three months
[1:42:44] and we were able
[1:42:47] to pay the first installment on the land
[1:42:49] which we had seen.
[1:42:53] I have looked for land
[1:42:56] until I I failed. But then, Sister
[1:42:59] Susan, is she hear this?
[1:43:03] Please stand up sister.
[1:43:06] Let us give her a clap.
[1:43:08] Amen. So sister Susan when we came in a
[1:43:11] meeting
[1:43:13] she tells me she tells us she has seen a
[1:43:16] land
[1:43:18] near her place.
[1:43:21] So we went and saw the land. The moment
[1:43:22] I saw it I knew this is the land and
[1:43:26] everybody that went there loved the
[1:43:29] land. Everybody said the land is good
[1:43:32] flowing with milk and honey.
[1:43:35] And so we paid by faith.
[1:43:38] We met this gentleman.
[1:43:40] No one gives you money
[1:43:43] rather a land unless you have paid all
[1:43:45] the money
[1:43:48] or a considerable like agreement where
[1:43:50] you're going to maybe three months.
[1:43:54] This land is 220 million.
[1:44:02] You know at first we wanted 150 but as
[1:44:04] time goes on land increases
[1:44:11] the price
[1:44:13] 250 20 million
[1:44:16] and God provided 100 million.
[1:44:19] We paid 100 million
[1:44:23] and the gentleman made an agreement with
[1:44:25] us
[1:44:28] that we which was a miracle.
[1:44:32] Another business person had come.
[1:44:36] Listen. And he wanted to take that to to
[1:44:38] buy that piece of
[1:44:40] Was it you who gave me the news?
[1:44:43] The other lady told you
[1:44:47] it was you. Come, come and come and tell
[1:44:50] the people just one minute.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; The lady told us that uh there is they
[1:44:56] had two client.
[1:45:02] This person works for the government
[1:45:05] and he wanted to first pay 100 million.
[1:45:11] Then he gave them something like 3
[1:45:13] months
[1:45:15] to pay the balance.
[1:45:18] Then she also mentioned a client who had
[1:45:20] all the money.
[1:45:24] And then she told us that she asked her
[1:45:26] boss
[1:45:29] that how comes that this way they have
[1:45:30] just given you of 10 million
[1:45:35] and then you refuse and yet this one is
[1:45:37] giving all
[1:45:41] and then she say that uh okay I don't
[1:45:43] remember very well what she the answer
[1:45:46] the gentleman gave me.
[1:45:49] I wish you could finish the story, but
[1:45:51] we don't have time.
[1:45:53] Two clients,
[1:45:55] they had more money than us. But they
[1:45:58] turned them down. Why? Because I had met
[1:46:00] this gentleman.
[1:46:02] And I told him my burden. And I said,
[1:46:05] "Help me reach our generation
[1:46:09] with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:46:12] We may not pay you the way you want.
[1:46:15] The blessing God will give you will be
[1:46:18] bigger than the money.
[1:46:20] So he accepted
[1:46:22] to give us the money. We the land we pay
[1:46:24] him 100 million
[1:46:27] and the rest of the money which is 120
[1:46:30] million
[1:46:32] to pay it in one year.
[1:46:35] That's a miracle
[1:46:37] 12 months.
[1:46:40] And so each which means 120 million
[1:46:43] divide by 12 months that's about 30
[1:46:46] million shillings every every um rather
[1:46:49] that's a we we did four quarters
[1:46:56] which has three months each.
[1:46:59] So every month 10 million
[1:47:04] that means every quarter every first
[1:47:06] every quarter 30 million.
[1:47:10] So this um the their office contacted me
[1:47:13] while I was in Canada
[1:47:15] and they said the time is done first
[1:47:18] quarter.
[1:47:19] We need our 30 minutes. I told him, "I'm
[1:47:22] away for on a mission.
[1:47:25] When I come back, I will pay you."
[1:47:27] And we had about 179.
[1:47:33] And so I arrived back and we we were
[1:47:36] looking for the funds. Don't have the
[1:47:38] funds.
[1:47:40] And um so I knew I had to go meet them.
[1:47:45] I went with the brothers. Why did we go
[1:47:48] there?
[1:47:51] Yes.
[1:47:55] Uh was it this week?
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Friday.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; This last Friday
[1:48:06] and uh we we met of course I went there
[1:48:08] like a rich man who has all the money in
[1:48:10] the world.
[1:48:13] You know brothers impression matters a
[1:48:14] lot
[1:48:18] cuz when I called on the phone and and
[1:48:21] the lady told me how much do you have
[1:48:24] I told her I'm going to bring 20 million
[1:48:27] and then she talked to our boss our boss
[1:48:28] said no tell the pastor we can't take 20
[1:48:31] million
[1:48:33] we want 30 million
[1:48:36] so we came back to you we told you we
[1:48:37] don't have the money we need to get
[1:48:41] but the money didn't come as we expected
[1:48:44] You have been giving what you can.
[1:48:47] We all have been giving what we can. And
[1:48:49] there's some money which was collected
[1:48:51] for youth camp.
[1:48:53] So we we collected as much as we can
[1:48:57] borrowing some from the youth camp.
[1:49:00] If last year we borrowed the youth camp
[1:49:02] what for from land fund why can't we
[1:49:04] borrow from youth camp for land?
[1:49:10] You understand? So, and then we were
[1:49:12] able to get a total of 25.5 million.
[1:49:17] So, I went I knew it was on the account.
[1:49:20] We wrote a check for it and we went. So,
[1:49:24] of course, he's he's happy to see us.
[1:49:27] He's thinking that we are going to pay
[1:49:28] the 30 million
[1:49:31] me. know we have 25.5
[1:49:34] and so we I tell him by the way
[1:49:38] um I'm not you know like trying to plead
[1:49:43] I'm I was giving a statement
[1:49:46] I said by the way for now we have 25.5
[1:49:51] you want to pay it and then to see if we
[1:49:54] can get the the first title
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; it was like throwing a stone in bees to
[1:50:00] hear what comes
[1:50:03] Do you know what he answered? He said,
[1:50:05] "It's all right, pastor."
[1:50:07] I thought he had not had me.
[1:50:10] I thought he had not added.
[1:50:12] So I said what I'm meaning
[1:50:16] we are going to pay 25.5 now
[1:50:21] so that the whole overall balance
[1:50:24] remains 95
[1:50:27] and also
[1:50:29] we want our first title.
[1:50:33] That's what I was meaning.
[1:50:35] He looked at me.
[1:50:38] He said it's all right
[1:50:46] here.
[1:50:51] Praise God.
[1:50:57] Amen.
[1:51:02] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God.
[1:51:08] It is not mine. It is for the church.
[1:51:12] Let them touch it and feel it
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; so that we get hope.
[1:51:20] We pledged on this second phase
[1:51:24] almost the remaining money is all pledge
[1:51:26] almost.
[1:51:28] I think this ring about maybe 15 or
[1:51:30] whatever million the rest is all pledge
[1:51:34] which means if we you decided to fulfill
[1:51:37] your pledge now
[1:51:41] you can pay up that land tomorrow
[1:51:46] and when you give your in your pledge
[1:51:48] you give as much as you can
[1:51:55] we will get this done with
[1:51:58] We build the church and we focus on the
[1:52:01] vision.
[1:52:04] Praise God. Praise God. Tell someone if
[1:52:08] you pledged and you not fulfill it,
[1:52:12] you're putting us behind.
[1:52:16] I he told me we want to transfer the
[1:52:18] title first.
[1:52:21] I said before we transfer it, I want to
[1:52:24] show my people that the land is ours.
[1:52:28] The land is ours
[1:52:32] on this title.
[1:52:35] We are not going to have
[1:52:39] we are going to have days of the voice
[1:52:41] ministry
[1:52:43] of the voice.
[1:52:46] We're not building a family kind of
[1:52:47] thing.
[1:52:49] We're building a a place of worship for
[1:52:51] you, for your children and their
[1:52:53] children. If the Lord carries
[1:52:58] Tell your neighbor, "We can do it.
[1:53:01] We can do it."
[1:53:03] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I think it's a good time to sing.
[1:53:08] The church is moving.
[1:53:12] Let us stand on our feet. We sing.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Well, if you want to sing, of course,
[1:53:16] you will not go back just like that. You

[2:02:48] now
[2:02:53] about
[2:03:03] what God
[2:03:05] was thinking.
[2:03:09] when he
[2:03:18] knew everything I would
[2:03:24] come true
[2:03:34] about
[2:03:39] The sun made the moon to harmonize and
[2:03:43] perfect. One can't move without the
[2:03:47] other.

[2:03:55] for me and I'm for you. Cuz my world
[2:03:59] just can't be right
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; without you in my life.
[2:04:07] I wonder what God
[2:04:10] was thinking
[2:04:14] when he
[2:04:23] knew everything.
[2:04:33] You must keep praying.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; I've been praying.

[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, he knew everything
[2:04:42] I wanted.
[2:04:46] When God met you,
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; I think God made you.
[2:04:53] When dreams come true,
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; when God,
[2:05:03] you must have been thinking
[2:05:08] about me.

[2:14:03] So, let us stand. Thank you, musicians.
[2:14:08] And so, I'd like us to sing a little
[2:14:09] chorus.
[2:14:12] As we now want to change the order of
[2:14:14] the service
[2:14:17] for at least an hour or so,
[2:14:21] uh we go into the word.
[2:14:24] I know we now have a few pending
[2:14:26] weddings
[2:14:29] and ceremonies and things. By the way, I
[2:14:33] wrote it somewhere but I had forgotten
[2:14:34] out there. I'd like you to join me to
[2:14:37] welcome back Sister Ma
[2:14:42] Amen. Amen.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; And Sister Fiona,
[2:14:45] we really really missed you.
[2:14:48] We are happy to be with you today.
[2:14:51] Amen. And I know they've not been
[2:14:54] missing any service.
[2:14:57] I've been watching streaming every
[2:14:59] service.
[2:15:02] And uh so sister Martha is going to have
[2:15:04] the ceremony of her daughter. Is it your
[2:15:06] daughter?
[2:15:10] your last born. So her last born is
[2:15:13] getting married
[2:15:16] the her in-laws are coming to visit
[2:15:20] and so she's invited me
[2:15:23] and but unfortunately as I already
[2:15:25] discussed with her will not be able to
[2:15:26] go.
[2:15:29] I say that with a lot of pain, Sister
[2:15:30] Ma.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; I know what that means to you.
[2:15:36] But uh we've asked I've asked some of
[2:15:38] the ministers here to
[2:15:42] and come and you know just be with the
[2:15:44] family
[2:15:46] perhaps also have some little time to
[2:15:47] share the word
[2:15:49] trusting that the Lord will come and
[2:15:51] move and
[2:15:53] that's only because sister Ruth and her
[2:15:55] husband brother Emmanuel is here.
[2:16:01] They had one year ago appointed me to be
[2:16:04] at their ceremony.
[2:16:09] So you can understand if you had invited
[2:16:11] me one year, you know. So
[2:16:16] we want to be there and support them.
[2:16:24] And so um we will be in Sorati. Is this
[2:16:28] Toro?
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Toro.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, we'll be in Toronto.
[2:16:33] A few that are going also. How many are
[2:16:35] going?
[2:16:37] Toro.
[2:16:40] Okay. So, several are going to
[2:16:45] uh and sister Ruth if not many come
[2:16:48] understand because you know the season
[2:16:50] is very calm.
[2:16:55] We all are behind that.
[2:16:58] Uh, sister Martha, are you inviting like
[2:17:00] as many
[2:17:04] send the ministers
[2:17:10] for five?
[2:17:14] So, we'll have two ministers. So, we
[2:17:16] have three more people. If you want to
[2:17:17] come,
[2:17:21] please uh see Brother Martin about it.
[2:17:27] It is better you see brother Martin not
[2:17:29] sister ma

[2:17:34] she'll feel bad.
[2:17:39] So you go to brother Martin let him
[2:17:41] connect.
[2:17:44] While we are standing I'm going to sing.
[2:17:46] I'd like to invite uh Sister Elizabeth
[2:17:54] uh to please bring a baby for
[2:17:55] dedication.

[2:18:41] baby?

[2:19:03] Brother Bham says, "All life comes from
[2:19:07] God.
[2:19:10] You want to dedicate this to your
[2:19:24] divine blessing.
[2:19:27] For your divine blessing.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. It's a girl boy.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Let let us pray for this little one. Our
[2:19:39] heavenly father, we come in the name of
[2:19:42] Jesus.
[2:19:44] Bringing this little one
[2:19:46] to you, Lord. All life comes from you
[2:19:50] and you've given this one. And we pray,
[2:19:53] oh God, that as this child is starting
[2:19:55] off her life,
[2:19:58] they shall have a long life that will
[2:20:01] stand for your word.
[2:20:04] Father Lord, I know that all those that
[2:20:06] are yours, you come to them early,
[2:20:10] early before the devil comes early
[2:20:12] before all the problems and troubles of
[2:20:15] the world come in.
[2:20:18] Lord, we therefore pray that you will
[2:20:19] take this little one
[2:20:22] and wrap wrap her in your arms of love.
[2:20:26] Watch her all the rest of her life. May
[2:20:29] she be a blessing. And Lord, may you,
[2:20:31] the divine one, be in our lives.
[2:20:35] and continue to be seen
[2:20:37] manifested. May she be a blessing both
[2:20:40] to the mother and father
[2:20:42] and that your grace will continue to
[2:20:43] shine upon me.
[2:20:45] I now dedicate divine blessing
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; divine blessing
[2:20:50] in the name of our Lord Jesus.
[2:20:52] Amen. Amen.
[2:20:56] Amen.
[2:20:59] We don't baptize children.
[2:21:02] We dedicate them.
[2:21:06] We are going to um to to read
[2:21:11] in uh
[2:21:13] Proverbs. Thank you musicians. I think
[2:21:15] that's that's all the singing will be
[2:21:23] 298.
[2:21:26] I'm continuing with political maneuvers
[2:21:28] that obscure the vision.
[2:21:31] time we're talking about it
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; and we are reading uh vers 18.
[2:21:46] Let us read it together
[2:21:50] 298.
[2:21:53] You are there read with me.
[2:21:56] Where there is no vision, the people
[2:21:59] perish. But he that keepeth the law,
[2:22:02] happy is he. All right, let us read it
[2:22:04] again. Where there is no vision, the
[2:22:08] people perish. But he that keepeth the
[2:22:10] law, happy is he. Amen.
[2:22:20] Amen. You may be seated, please.
[2:22:26] I appreciate
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; sister Mariam's song and
[2:22:34] and the rest that sang the special song.
[2:22:36] God bless you.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; You know it's a a few weddings pending.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Julius Julius
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; the faith
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; where are they?
[2:22:56] Is brother Julius here today?
[2:22:59] Your chair is right here.
[2:23:02] I don't know what happened.
[2:23:05] Where is Sister Faith?
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, these ones, by the way, did
[2:23:11] you set your wedding date yet?
[2:23:15] We don't know them. I think we'll need
[2:23:18] to get a board there
[2:23:20] so we can put all those things on the
[2:23:22] board for people to keep remembering.
[2:23:25] Brother Enoch. Enoch. Where? Where?
[2:23:28] Where is Brother Eno? Right over here.
[2:23:31] And sister.
[2:23:36] No.
[2:23:38] Okay. Uh she goes to Life Boat. And
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; also Sister Monica
[2:23:44] right over here
[2:23:46] and u and brother Sadat in in UAE.
[2:23:53] Now, brother Joel, Sister Ruth,
[2:23:58] we just need to keep this in prayers
[2:24:02] in prayers.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; And there's more coming.
[2:24:06] So, it's a season that we are going
[2:24:08] through as a church.
[2:24:10] When I look around, I see others who are
[2:24:12] coming.
[2:24:15] If I was allowed by God, I could mention
[2:24:17] your names.
[2:24:20] Some of you don't know yet.
[2:24:22] But you are the one coming.
[2:24:26] You know, it's good to settle down and
[2:24:27] serve God.
[2:24:32] Amen. But every every season of life has
[2:24:34] its own challenges.
[2:24:38] So I'm happy to see those ones who are
[2:24:39] married like sister favor serving God.
[2:24:46] Where are they? Can they stand up?
[2:24:53] Is he stepped out?
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; You were telling him he missed the
[2:24:58] moment.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Uh you know these ones you know they uh
[2:25:03] travel
[2:25:05] since before even they got married.
[2:25:08] They were traveling from
[2:25:11] not missing a service
[2:25:14] and after marriage it continued
[2:25:18] and I want to say we appreciate that
[2:25:20] kind of commitment.
[2:25:22] We really appreciate that kind of
[2:25:23] commitment
[2:25:25] and brother is he here?
[2:25:29] Yes. right at the post of duty
[2:25:37] minister
[2:25:39] and his wife where
[2:25:43] sister charity
[2:25:45] deacon deacon's wife so many people ask
[2:25:50] at such a time because their mothers
[2:25:54] I know we don't have any place for
[2:25:55] children and all that but
[2:25:57] not so many people should really be
[2:25:59] outside
[2:26:01] and and so these ones have continued. I
[2:26:04] mean I always see sister charity there
[2:26:05] playing.
[2:26:07] I think we want to appreciate those kind
[2:26:09] of labors.
[2:26:12] We want to appreciate those kind of
[2:26:13] labors
[2:26:15] and you know the different ones and so
[2:26:17] even those of you who are married or
[2:26:19] getting married
[2:26:22] let's just continue serving God.
[2:26:25] And I know brother
[2:26:27] um
[2:26:31] uh sister Sarah and brother Emmanuel
[2:26:36] they they have they have a fellowship in
[2:26:39] their house
[2:26:42] and um I don't know you meet every
[2:26:44] Friday right
[2:26:46] and every Wednesday brother Emmanuel is
[2:26:49] here
[2:26:51] and when brother polycap left
[2:26:54] he took the reigns to you know to handle
[2:26:56] the that and so he's always been coming
[2:26:58] even on Wednesdays imagine coming from
[2:27:01] two times a week
[2:27:03] that's a sacrifice
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; on Sunday here the other Sunday I met a
[2:27:07] sister
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; and I was shocked I received the shock
[2:27:11] of my life
[2:27:13] she comes every Sunday from
[2:27:17] is she here this morning she had told me
[2:27:19] she will not be here this year she'll be
[2:27:21] here every Sunday she comes from
[2:27:26] and travels back up
[2:27:29] because there is no church that she
[2:27:30] knows all of.
[2:27:32] I did not know that to me. I think God
[2:27:35] really looks at such sacrifices
[2:27:38] and is pleased by that kind of let us
[2:27:41] serve God by sacrifice.
[2:27:45] Is that a man? Brother Dixon, there is a
[2:27:48] chair right over here.
[2:27:50] Brother Samuel, if you don't minduel.
[2:27:53] Amen. And then we have of course the
[2:27:55] senior the ones who are married. You
[2:27:57] know I was just counting the couples
[2:28:01] and I counted 20 couples.
[2:28:04] You can't believe it. 20 couples.
[2:28:09] And I think we need to give a clap to
[2:28:11] the Lord for that.
[2:28:14] and uh pray that God will give us grace
[2:28:18] you know to uh cuz you know there's a
[2:28:21] lot of work to do both in our families
[2:28:22] raise the families
[2:28:26] but to raise them to like raise them but
[2:28:28] also to to you know to to raise you know
[2:28:30] to do what we can do in the work of God
[2:28:36] and that's why it is important
[2:28:38] for me to be talking about vision.
[2:28:42] Amen. And also without you know I know
[2:28:45] as soon as they got married the bakers
[2:28:47] the baka traveled you know to Karamoa
[2:28:53] but all the same the sister has
[2:28:56] faithfully been coming and
[2:28:59] also one of the leaders of the land
[2:29:01] fund.
[2:29:05] I want to say we sincerely appreciate
[2:29:07] that.
[2:29:09] I know sometimes when you get to
[2:29:11] appreciate people, talk about people,
[2:29:12] you leave out others unintentionally.
[2:29:19] But uh just turn to your neighbor, tell
[2:29:21] them I appreciate you.
[2:29:25] I appreciate you.
[2:29:27] Amen.
[2:29:29] Amen. Where there is no vision,
[2:29:33] people perish.
[2:29:35] Now I'm planning to speak for uh not so
[2:29:38] long because already time is first
[2:29:40] spent.
[2:29:43] If we would normally take our time that
[2:29:44] means I have 30 minutes
[2:29:48] but let's see what the Lord will do
[2:29:52] if you pull on the word
[2:29:55] you will receive your food quickly and
[2:29:58] if you just think about other things
[2:30:02] then you receive nothing.
[2:30:05] Tell your neighbor, I will receive
[2:30:06] something from God.
[2:30:09] I read for you a quote on Sunday trying
[2:30:11] to do God a service without it without
[2:30:13] it being the will of
[2:30:20] God reveals this word in the season and
[2:30:24] to whom he chooses to reveal it.
[2:30:28] See,
[2:30:31] there are seasons and there are times
[2:30:34] and God chooses who
[2:30:38] because remember we're talking about the
[2:30:40] vision
[2:30:42] and we're talking about and if you could
[2:30:44] just give me your univerent
[2:30:48] just about 60 minutes or so see what the
[2:30:51] Lord will speak to you.
[2:30:53] So you know when God is about to do
[2:30:56] something
[2:30:58] we realize he always uses a man.
[2:31:03] There is no single time in history
[2:31:06] where God has done anything
[2:31:10] without using a man.
[2:31:12] That's why in the book of Amos 3:7
[2:31:16] he says surely the Lord God will do
[2:31:18] nothing
[2:31:20] but he revealth his secret to his son.
[2:31:25] And so we see that God at every time,
[2:31:31] at every turning of a corner,
[2:31:36] he uses a man
[2:31:39] to accomplish his vision.
[2:31:42] So then God has a vision
[2:31:46] but then he calls a man
[2:31:49] and he gives him a mission
[2:31:51] in order to carry out or to bring about
[2:31:55] that vision
[2:31:57] for the people.
[2:31:59] So now the man is called the missionary
[2:32:05] or really is called a servant, a
[2:32:07] prophet,
[2:32:09] a pastor. You know this this is a man
[2:32:12] that God called.
[2:32:14] And you see the one that God called
[2:32:17] is not chosen by man.
[2:32:20] That's why I do not believe
[2:32:22] that for a church to move.
[2:32:25] A church needs to determine who is
[2:32:28] holding the vision.
[2:32:34] Yes, the church can.
[2:32:37] But you see the church must rely on God.
[2:32:41] If you notice, brother Bam talks about
[2:32:44] the leadership or rulership.
[2:32:48] And he says, "It's not the rulership of
[2:32:50] man that I believe in."
[2:32:54] He says, "But he believes in that of the
[2:32:56] Holy Spirit by the word."
[2:33:01] When God, listen church, when God raises
[2:33:03] a man,
[2:33:05] he gives, he equips that man.
[2:33:08] If God can call each and every one of
[2:33:10] you here,
[2:33:12] he will give you what to use.
[2:33:16] And you know, he always gives the word
[2:33:19] and the spirit. Those are the two things
[2:33:22] God uses.
[2:33:24] And it can never change at any time.
[2:33:28] Is that a man?
[2:33:30] Notice that even in the days to past,
[2:33:33] God has been using men,
[2:33:36] men that he speaks to,
[2:33:38] man. He speaks mouth to ear.
[2:33:41] And so even the church, any church, any
[2:33:44] local church,
[2:33:46] you want to be sure you have a God
[2:33:48] called man.
[2:33:54] We have many pastors
[2:33:57] but we have few God called pastors
[2:34:01] and we have many apostles
[2:34:03] but very few God called apostles
[2:34:07] missionaries apostles preachers
[2:34:11] but those that are called by God
[2:34:14] are few but you have many that are
[2:34:18] raised by men
[2:34:22] politically maneuver maneuvering with
[2:34:24] their own power and money
[2:34:30] and then they or they bring the Bible
[2:34:33] says they he to themselves teachers
[2:34:38] because they have itching ears.
[2:34:40] They want to hear only what they want to
[2:34:42] hear.
[2:34:44] So the man has to be popular among them.
[2:34:49] You have to say the man has to say what
[2:34:51] they want to hear.
[2:34:53] in order for them to love him. Even a
[2:34:56] man will fear
[2:34:58] to speak the full counsel of the word
[2:35:03] because if he does some people will go
[2:35:07] I just told you here some people have
[2:35:09] left
[2:35:12] of course don't be confused people leave
[2:35:14] every church
[2:35:17] because every ministry
[2:35:20] is very peculiar
[2:35:22] every ministry is special.
[2:35:26] Every ministry is special.
[2:35:28] Tell your neighbor. Every ministry is
[2:35:30] special.
[2:35:32] Amen. I really I really, you know,
[2:35:35] during this subject,
[2:35:38] if you have noticed I'm really
[2:35:40] downloading my vision,
[2:35:44] my assignment
[2:35:46] to you as a church,
[2:35:48] the vision of this church so that we can
[2:35:51] because you cannot run
[2:35:53] without knowing what you are running
[2:35:54] after.
[2:35:57] You need to know why you are here. You
[2:35:59] need to know what we are doing.
[2:36:02] We need to catch the vision. So the
[2:36:04] things I'm speaking about are really for
[2:36:07] the local church for you to be enriched
[2:36:10] and uh and um you know settled.
[2:36:16] So I'm not here really to just preach a
[2:36:18] little sermon or
[2:36:22] I want to speak my heart
[2:36:26] and um this is the third service I'm
[2:36:27] speaking on this
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; and I just pray that you help me to open
[2:36:31] your heart.
[2:36:34] Praise God.
[2:36:36] So you see every ministry is special
[2:36:40] and you know people come to a church and
[2:36:43] people go out of a church. The reason
[2:36:46] why is because you can only stay in a
[2:36:50] church
[2:36:51] when you understand what is being done
[2:36:53] there.
[2:36:56] When you understand the vision,
[2:36:58] if you can't catch it, you can't stay. I
[2:37:02] was in the Anglican church. I left
[2:37:06] because I couldn't understand the vision
[2:37:09] and I received this message and now I'm
[2:37:11] running because I understand the vision.
[2:37:16] So when now in a little now you
[2:37:18] understand when I'm talking about
[2:37:19] callings ministry season I'm I'm
[2:37:21] referring to churches as a as as a as a
[2:37:24] body of Christ
[2:37:30] but I'm also referring to you know
[2:37:32] fellowships
[2:37:34] and I'm also referring to you as an
[2:37:36] individual
[2:37:38] you have to have discernment to know
[2:37:39] what I'm talking about when I'm talking
[2:37:46] And so when God calls a man, he chooses
[2:37:49] who he reveals that mystery.
[2:37:54] God does not, you know, man can choose.
[2:37:58] But God does not use what man has
[2:38:00] chosen.
[2:38:03] God always uses what he has chosen.
[2:38:08] You remember Paul was chosen by God. He
[2:38:12] was fighting the church but God chose
[2:38:14] him. But you see the church the
[2:38:18] disciples they have chosen a man called
[2:38:21] Matus
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; politically maneuvering to do that.
[2:38:27] They they took a vote.
[2:38:30] They didn't wait upon God.
[2:38:33] God never told him told them
[2:38:36] you know separate from me Matus.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; But no That was their own decision.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; You know, you talk about the church
[2:38:48] sometimes, you know, to go into those,
[2:38:51] the Bible says, um, you know, we have
[2:38:53] power or authority to bind. Anything on
[2:38:55] earth is bound in heaven
[2:39:00] and anything we lose on earth will be
[2:39:02] lose in heaven.
[2:39:04] And many times people want to use that
[2:39:08] in the wrong way.
[2:39:11] It is not according to your desire.
[2:39:17] It is according to his will.
[2:39:20] What is the will of God?
[2:39:23] But how can you know the will of God?
[2:39:26] When you are minded,
[2:39:31] the Bible says to be cannally minded
[2:39:36] is death. But you see, for you to
[2:39:39] understand the will of God,
[2:39:42] walk in the realm that God wants you to
[2:39:44] walk,
[2:39:46] you have to be spiritually mind.
[2:39:51] And so these people they simply
[2:39:53] politically did it.
[2:39:56] They didn't wait upon God.
[2:39:59] But God said, "Separate out to me Paul
[2:40:00] and Barnabas.
[2:40:03] He called
[2:40:05] the man he called." He was not liked by
[2:40:08] them.
[2:40:09] They actually feared him. He was a
[2:40:12] persecutor of the church.
[2:40:15] He had killed many of them. But God came
[2:40:19] and chose him. And he said, "I want you
[2:40:21] to go and work with. Oh, I want you know
[2:40:25] God always recruits people that are
[2:40:26] questionable."
[2:40:30] Amen. God always recruits people
[2:40:34] don't approve of.
[2:40:38] He comes and chooses Moses.
[2:40:40] Moses was questionable.
[2:40:43] Moses had mathered somebody
[2:40:45] and had ran away into exile.
[2:40:48] But God did not see anyone in Egypt.
[2:40:54] You know, he only saw one man,
[2:40:57] Moses. Do you know why? Because he had
[2:41:00] actually seen Moses
[2:41:02] before he was born.
[2:41:04] You know, God does not make decisions
[2:41:08] depending on your actions.
[2:41:10] God does not make decisions depending on
[2:41:13] what has happened in your life.
[2:41:16] And then he feels so sorry for you and
[2:41:19] he says over me. Let me now send them
[2:41:22] just for them to feel better. No. God
[2:41:26] chooses you before you are born. You
[2:41:30] only walk into your calling.
[2:41:33] That's why the Bible says make your
[2:41:36] calling an election sure.
[2:41:40] Your calling is already there.
[2:41:44] You make it sure.
[2:41:46] You have to establish it. You have to
[2:41:49] know what God has called you to
[2:41:50] accomplish.
[2:41:53] You have to have vision.
[2:41:55] You have to know what you are here to
[2:41:57] accomplish.
[2:42:00] Praise God.
[2:42:02] If you get married and you don't know
[2:42:05] how many children you want to have,
[2:42:07] you don't know what you want to do with
[2:42:08] your family,
[2:42:11] you don't know nothing, it's the wrong
[2:42:13] choice for you to take.
[2:42:17] You cannot get into a marriage
[2:42:21] without having a vision.
[2:42:23] Every brother, every man should have a
[2:42:26] vision for this.
[2:42:30] Brother, I have a lot of steer if you
[2:42:31] can help me. Now, he says he chose that
[2:42:33] before the foundation of the world.
[2:42:37] All of his doings were for known by him,
[2:42:41] hidden from man. He just reveals them as
[2:42:44] he will.
[2:42:46] It is his chosen season,
[2:42:49] his chosen person.
[2:42:51] Everyone say chosen season,
[2:42:54] chosen person.
[2:42:57] And he never did choose a party, a a a
[2:42:59] party or sect.
[2:43:03] It is a chosen person.
[2:43:05] How does he how he does it? Who is it
[2:43:08] that will dare correct him?
[2:43:12] Now say, Lord, you made a mistake by
[2:43:13] putting this man in the ministry.
[2:43:17] This man doesn't believe like we
[2:43:18] believe.
[2:43:20] who is going to tell God he's wrong.
[2:43:24] It will take somebody that's a little
[2:43:25] more of a living than I am to tell him
[2:43:27] that.
[2:43:30] He knows what he's doing.
[2:43:33] He knows who to choose and he knows who
[2:43:36] not to choose
[2:43:38] and he knows what to do and he knows
[2:43:41] when to do it.
[2:43:47] Can I preach to you for just
[2:43:49] If someone tells you that you were not
[2:43:52] supposed to be chosen by God, tell them
[2:43:55] God knows what he is doing.
[2:43:58] The devil will come and tell you even
[2:44:01] with all those weaknesses.
[2:44:05] Even with all those we your mistakes,
[2:44:09] you know, God chose you
[2:44:11] not depending on your mistakes.
[2:44:15] God chose you
[2:44:17] depending on his will.
[2:44:21] Amen. Amen. Moses, whether you want it
[2:44:25] or not, you are going to go and do the
[2:44:28] mission.
[2:44:31] You can give all the excuse that you
[2:44:34] want,
[2:44:36] but nothing
[2:44:38] God from using you.
[2:44:41] Am I talking to a Moses here?
[2:44:44] Oh, I can't talk very well.
[2:44:47] Oh, I killed somebody. Oh, I'm very old.
[2:44:51] That doesn't matter.
[2:44:53] If God called you and there's a purpose
[2:44:56] in your life,
[2:44:58] purpose must be.
[2:45:02] God calls you when he wants to call you,
[2:45:06] chooses you, and then he sends you out.
[2:45:10] Praise God.
[2:45:13] Now he knows what he's doing.
[2:45:16] No matter how much we think that a
[2:45:18] certain person is qualified to do a
[2:45:19] certain job,
[2:45:22] God knows who is qualified for the time
[2:45:28] or the time and the right time to do it.
[2:45:32] That is why as a body of believers, we
[2:45:35] must never fight to minister.
[2:45:41] When you see a door closed for you,
[2:45:46] don't force it.
[2:45:48] It's not the season.
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; When you see, you're forcing things to
[2:45:55] you're forcing things.
[2:45:57] You have to convince people
[2:46:01] to believe in you. It's not the right
[2:46:03] season.
[2:46:05] Humble yourself. Wait for the right
[2:46:07] season because you know what? God has a
[2:46:10] way of activating whoever he call.
[2:46:14] Hallelujah.
[2:46:20] And God has visited our season.
[2:46:23] He has visited our generation
[2:46:26] and he has sent us a prophet
[2:46:29] with a message
[2:46:31] of restoration.
[2:46:33] Amen. This is the time of restoration.
[2:46:39] Tell your neighbor this is a time of
[2:46:40] restoration.
[2:46:43] Now I don't know if this is this will be
[2:46:46] all I doing in this service but I want
[2:46:48] to show you certain things scriptures
[2:46:52] uh before I continue.
[2:46:55] This is going to be like a teaching
[2:46:58] about five scriptures or so. And I want
[2:47:01] us brother just give me Isaiah 61 and I
[2:47:06] want us to go through the scriptures.
[2:47:09] together.
[2:47:10] I want us to understand. If you have a
[2:47:13] pen and paper, write something
[2:47:16] because I want you to understand the
[2:47:19] promise,
[2:47:20] the prophecy of our time
[2:47:24] of our season. Amen. The spirit of the
[2:47:28] Lord God is upon me
[2:47:33] because the Lord has anointed me to
[2:47:35] preach the good tidings unto the meek.
[2:47:39] He has sent me to bind up the
[2:47:40] brokenhearted
[2:47:42] to proclaim liberty to the captive and
[2:47:46] the opening of the prison to them that
[2:47:48] abound
[2:47:50] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[2:47:52] Lord
[2:47:54] and the day of vengeance of our God
[2:47:58] and to comfort all that mourn.
[2:48:02] Now I want you to see verses two.
[2:48:07] Sometimes
[2:48:09] we say these things quick quick quick
[2:48:13] but I want to go slowly.
[2:48:17] I want you to understand it and if you
[2:48:20] have not understood it after the service
[2:48:23] you are free to send me a WhatsApp text
[2:48:26] and I will explain it.
[2:48:29] See, we proclaim the acceptable year of
[2:48:31] the Lord
[2:48:35] and the day of vengeance of our
[2:48:39] comfort all that more.
[2:48:43] Now this scripture from verses 1 to2
[2:48:47] speaking of the coming of the Messiah.
[2:48:52] You see this scripture was partly or
[2:48:55] partially fulfilled in Luke 4.
[2:49:03] But I first give you background
[2:49:07] in in Isaiah 61.
[2:49:10] He Isaiah is giving a prophecy.
[2:49:13] And this is really about the coming of
[2:49:16] the Messiah.
[2:49:18] And he's saying that the spirit of the
[2:49:20] Lord has anointed me
[2:49:23] to preach good tidings
[2:49:25] unto the meek. He has sent me to bind up
[2:49:29] the brokenhearted
[2:49:33] to proclaim liberty to the captive
[2:49:36] and the opening of the prison to them
[2:49:38] that are bound.
[2:49:40] I ask you church who did that.
[2:49:47] Some are not sure. If Yeshua shouted,
[2:49:49] "Who knew that?"
[2:49:52] Jesus did it.
[2:49:54] &gt;&gt; In him, which coming
[2:49:58] the first,
[2:50:02] the third?
[2:50:05] The first.
[2:50:07] All right. And when he comes, he
[2:50:10] continues on. He says to proclaim
[2:50:15] acceptable.
[2:50:18] If I had time, I would expound on that.
[2:50:21] The acceptable year
[2:50:24] is also the same that the Bible speaks
[2:50:25] of as the year of Jubilee.
[2:50:29] You know, when the the the the Bible
[2:50:33] says that the land will not be sold or
[2:50:35] go forever.
[2:50:39] When one of them lost his property,
[2:50:43] he he you know, he would wait. There are
[2:50:46] many ways of redemption, but he would
[2:50:47] wait. One of these, he would wait
[2:50:50] until the 50th year.
[2:50:53] And when the trumpet would sound,
[2:50:56] then he would be free.
[2:51:00] If he was a slave, if his land was sold
[2:51:04] or taken,
[2:51:06] then he would be free to reclaim his
[2:51:08] land.
[2:51:10] In the year of Jubilee,
[2:51:13] in the year of freedom,
[2:51:16] Year of Jubilee is the acceptable year
[2:51:19] of
[2:51:21] where slaves would be set
[2:51:25] where those who are in prison would be
[2:51:26] open
[2:51:29] where the blind would see.
[2:51:32] Amen. Where the brokenhearted would be
[2:51:34] healed.
[2:51:36] You see, so the the acceptable year
[2:51:39] is the year of salvation
[2:51:42] is a season where the Messiah would come
[2:51:45] down and do the work of salvation.
[2:51:52] But you see that's not all
[2:51:55] that is only in his first coming.
[2:51:59] The Messiah is coming again,
[2:52:03] his second coming. And when he comes, it
[2:52:07] is called the day of vengeance.
[2:52:12] Other parts he calls it a dreadful
[2:52:14] devil.
[2:52:17] The feather shall burn as an oven.
[2:52:21] I know that the many ways we can look at
[2:52:23] it right now
[2:52:26] because we know before the Lord comes
[2:52:29] before his judgment strike the earth
[2:52:32] then the rapture must go.
[2:52:35] Are you following me, sir? Ask your
[2:52:38] neighbor, are you following?
[2:52:40] Please follow.
[2:52:42] Before the judgments of God begin
[2:52:44] striking,
[2:52:47] the rapture must happen.
[2:52:50] And we are waiting for the rapture.
[2:52:53] I know we are already in the rapture,
[2:52:57] but we're waiting for the final
[2:52:59] conclusion.
[2:53:02] Our bodies must put on immortality.
[2:53:07] Amen. Amen. That's what we are looking
[2:53:09] for. But you see, right now we are
[2:53:13] entering into it.
[2:53:15] By the way,
[2:53:17] let me just stick with this. It says to
[2:53:19] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[2:53:23] and the day of vengeance.
[2:53:27] The dreadful day of
[2:53:30] great day. dreadful day, great day,
[2:53:34] dreadful day. So there are two days of
[2:53:37] there is a great day and there's a
[2:53:39] dreadful day.
[2:53:42] The great day is the first coming of the
[2:53:45] Messiah.
[2:53:48] The dreadful day is the second coming of
[2:53:51] the Messiah.
[2:53:53] How many see that? Say amen.
[2:53:56] Now when Jesus, give me Luke 4, Jesus
[2:53:58] came,
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; you know what I love about Jesus,
[2:54:02] he knew every scripture that wrote about
[2:54:05] spoke about.
[2:54:09] Amen. Amen. If it is your season, you
[2:54:12] will see yourself in the word.
[2:54:17] Amen. Even me today, I can read some
[2:54:21] scripture
[2:54:22] and I can say that's me.
[2:54:25] That's me this day in the scripture for
[2:54:31] let us see this Luke 4 17 and there was
[2:54:36] delivered unto him the book
[2:54:39] of the prophet Isaiah and when he had
[2:54:42] opened the book he found the place
[2:54:46] where it was written.
[2:54:48] Now the Bible says, "Oh church, some of
[2:54:52] you
[2:54:53] these things are going over your head.
[2:54:58] Focus.
[2:55:00] Don't miss a thing because I'm speaking
[2:55:02] of prophecy.
[2:55:04] I'm speaking of seasons and times.
[2:55:07] You must understand your season.
[2:55:12] When the book was delivered to here,
[2:55:14] brother, come up here.
[2:55:19] The book was delivered to him.
[2:55:22] Turn to the people.
[2:55:25] It was not a book like this one.
[2:55:27] It was a scroll.
[2:55:30] But you see those each book what we call
[2:55:34] a book today
[2:55:37] like a book of Isaiah
[2:55:39] there were scrolls.
[2:55:42] So there was a book or scroll of Isaiah.
[2:55:47] They gave him the scroll of Isaiah.
[2:55:51] That was not a mystery.
[2:55:54] Who gave it to him? A priest gave it to
[2:55:57] him. That was not a mystery. It was God
[2:56:01] bringing a season.
[2:56:05] Hallelujah.
[2:56:06] When it is the season, you can't force
[2:56:09] it.
[2:56:11] When it is the season for God to fulfill
[2:56:13] something
[2:56:15] in your life, he will open the door for
[2:56:18] you
[2:56:19] and then you
[2:56:22] walk through that door.
[2:56:25] Now we see why did they give him
[2:56:32] I was just going right.
[2:56:36] I was coming because the same thing
[2:56:38] happened.
[2:56:41] Now when the season was right, they gave
[2:56:44] him the book. Now he knew what to look
[2:56:48] for.
[2:56:51] He started looking for a place.
[2:56:54] Do you know where he looked for?
[2:56:57] Can you find what he looked for?
[2:56:59] He started looking. He knows what he's
[2:57:02] looking for because he knows who he is.
[2:57:06] Rather than the victory that overcomes
[2:57:07] the world,
[2:57:11] is in who knowing who you are.
[2:57:16] Amen.
[2:57:21] The victory that overcomes the world.
[2:57:24] It is for you to know who you are
[2:57:28] and to know your position in the
[2:57:30] scripture
[2:57:34] and to know which scripture are you
[2:57:36] fulfilling at this moment.
[2:57:39] After seeing yourself in the scripture I
[2:57:43] confer
[2:57:44] there is no power of the word. There is
[2:57:47] no power of
[2:57:49] that can put you down. Amen.
[2:57:53] Jesus said to Peter,
[2:57:56] "Upon this rock,
[2:57:58] build my church,
[2:58:01] and the gates of hell shall not prevail.
[2:58:05] The church is built
[2:58:08] for a revelation of who Christ is.
[2:58:14] We are not talking about the Christ of
[2:58:16] the former generation,
[2:58:19] but the Christ of this age."
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:23] Christ that is in me
[2:58:26] Christ in you
[2:58:29] hope of your glory.
[2:58:33] If he is in me,
[2:58:35] he will do the miracles he did. He will
[2:58:38] move the way he move
[2:58:42] his life.
[2:58:45] Amen.
[2:58:48] Hallelujah.
[2:58:50] Praise God.
[2:58:52] Let us follow this.
[2:58:54] He found the place.
[2:58:58] Why did he find the place? Because he
[2:59:01] knew himself.
[2:59:03] And what scripture is speaking of him
[2:59:08] and he found the place.
[2:59:11] And when he found it, he began reading
[2:59:15] gave him. Let him read it.
[2:59:20] that the spirit of the Lord is upon me.
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; He's reading now Isaiah 61. Uh-huh.
[2:59:25] &gt;&gt; Because the Lord has anointed me.
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; Stay in Luke. Uh-huh. Continue.
[2:59:29] &gt;&gt; To preach good tidings unto the meek.
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; He has sent me to bind up the
[2:59:35] brokenhearted.
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; Listen. Uh-huh.
[2:59:37] &gt;&gt; To proclaim the liberty to the captive.
[2:59:41] &gt;&gt; And the opening of the prison to them
[2:59:44] that are bound.
[2:59:45] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. to proclaim the acceptable year
[2:59:49] of the Lord.
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; Let me see if you have revelation.
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; And wait, brother, are you sure he went
[2:59:54] all that far while he was reading?
[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:59:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. Can you read a verse two again?
[2:59:59] &gt;&gt; To proclaim the acceptable year of the
[3:00:01] Lord.
[3:00:01] &gt;&gt; Do what? Exactly what he did, brother.
[3:00:04] If you know, if you don't know, you give
[3:00:05] me back the mic.
[3:00:08] &gt;&gt; And he said, uh,
[3:00:10] &gt;&gt; today the scripture is fulfilled.
[3:00:14] after you read.
[3:00:15] &gt;&gt; Okay, I will guide you. Don't worry.
[3:00:17] Read verse two.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; To proclaim the acceptable year of the
[3:00:20] Lord.
[3:00:21] &gt;&gt; Okay, you've stopped there, right?
[3:00:24] Okay, go to Isaiah. I want you. I want
[3:00:27] you to see something. When Jesus read in
[3:00:30] Isaiah 61 quickly somewhere in the
[3:00:32] middle now, he is reading Isaiah 61
[3:00:38] to proclaim the acceptable year of
[3:00:42] a question.
[3:00:44] Does this verse stop there?
[3:00:49] It is continuing.
[3:00:51] That is a comma, right?
[3:00:53] And
[3:00:55] he never read that.
[3:01:00] So give him the microphone. Let us guide
[3:01:03] him to see how Jesus did it. Huh? Read
[3:01:04] verse two. To proclaim the acceptable
[3:01:07] year
[3:01:09] of the Lord.
[3:01:11] Surrender everything. This is what Jesus
[3:01:13] did. Give me the microphone. Give me the
[3:01:16] book. Uhhuh. All right. And then he did
[3:01:20] what? Wait. Wait.
[3:01:23] He went back and sat.
[3:01:30] And he sat down.
[3:01:33] See this man is sat down.
[3:01:36] You see how you're looking at him?
[3:01:38] That's how everybody looked at him. Gave
[3:01:41] him the microphone.
[3:01:45] He didn't even bother to stand up again.
[3:01:49] They expected he will continue reading
[3:01:51] the verse.
[3:01:55] Continue. Today
[3:01:57] this scripture is fulfilled in your very
[3:01:59] eyes in your ears.
[3:02:01] &gt;&gt; In your ears. Okay.
[3:02:08] Many of you have not understood.
[3:02:11] Many of them did not understand.
[3:02:14] But let me bring you understand.
[3:02:17] Jesus while he was sat there and he was
[3:02:20] telling them the portion which I have
[3:02:23] read
[3:02:25] the portion you have heard me read.
[3:02:28] Now
[3:02:30] it is fulfilled.
[3:02:33] It is finished.
[3:02:35] This day what day? season.
[3:02:41] What time my coming
[3:02:46] has fulfilled this portion.
[3:02:50] Amen. He was trying to say I am the Lord
[3:02:55] and I have come to proclaim
[3:02:58] the acceptable year.
[3:03:02] I have come to proclaim.
[3:03:07] I have come to tell everybody you are
[3:03:10] free
[3:03:12] the son of man
[3:03:17] I am here and because I'm here today
[3:03:26] can you imagine that
[3:03:29] this scripture was written
[3:03:31] many many years ago but Jesus came and
[3:03:35] he read
[3:03:37] And he told them it is fulfilled
[3:03:41] because he knew he was the Lord. Others
[3:03:45] thought he was just a good master.
[3:03:49] He was a good teacher. Others thought he
[3:03:52] was a prophet. Others thought but you
[3:03:55] know he knew who he was.
[3:03:58] He knew he was more than a prophet.
[3:04:01] He knew he was God himself.
[3:04:04] failed in human life
[3:04:06] and he had come the first coming.
[3:04:11] He read the prophecy of Isaiah
[3:04:13] and he owned it.
[3:04:16] He said this day the scripture is
[3:04:19] fulfilled. But there was another part.
[3:04:24] Brother,
[3:04:26] don't do what you want. Do what I
[3:04:31] was.
[3:04:33] Isaiah 61.
[3:04:35] &gt;&gt; All right. Are you there yet?
[3:04:39] Two
[3:04:41] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[3:04:42] Lord.
[3:04:45] Read with me. Emphasize that. And I will
[3:04:48] take
[3:04:50] of the Lord. Let us go.
[3:04:55] In other words, this is not one day.
[3:05:02] It is in in one verse,
[3:05:05] but one verse is speaking about two
[3:05:08] days.
[3:05:10] One verse is speaking about two days.
[3:05:13] The first day is the acceptable year of
[3:05:16] the Lord
[3:05:18] and
[3:05:22] the day of vengeance
[3:05:25] of the Lord, the dreadful day of the
[3:05:28] Lord.
[3:05:30] In other words, Jesus knew he had not
[3:05:34] come to proclaim the day of vengeance.
[3:05:39] He had not come to judge anyone.
[3:05:42] But he had come to save everybody.
[3:05:46] But there was coming
[3:05:48] when he would come as a
[3:05:53] we know him to be son of man, son of
[3:05:58] God, son of David. And when he comes
[3:06:01] back,
[3:06:02] son of David, he's going to judge the
[3:06:04] living and the dead.
[3:06:08] But now he had come a son of man,
[3:06:12] a prophet, a God man
[3:06:17] to come and proclaim
[3:06:19] acceptable.
[3:06:22] How did he do it when he was on the
[3:06:24] cross? When he pierced his
[3:06:29] cried out and he said it is fair.
[3:06:36] meant I have now proclaimed
[3:06:40] from this time anybody
[3:06:43] in me
[3:06:45] again
[3:06:52] and the blood which I have shed is the
[3:06:56] covenant
[3:06:57] the blood of my new
[3:07:01] and Jesus declared acceptable
[3:07:05] And until today, the whole world is only
[3:07:10] talking about the acceptable.
[3:07:14] It is called good news.
[3:07:17] It's called good news.
[3:07:20] It's got good news.
[3:07:22] So every church you see is preaching
[3:07:25] good news
[3:07:27] is the acceptable.
[3:07:29] Can I tell you something?
[3:07:31] Jesus does not only come for the good
[3:07:34] news.
[3:07:36] There is also time
[3:07:39] for bad news.
[3:07:41] The kingsman redeemer,
[3:07:44] the kingsman avenger also.
[3:07:48] Let me tell you, he's coming back again.
[3:07:52] Amen. Amen. We have received a message.
[3:07:56] His message has come not only to give us
[3:07:59] the good news.
[3:08:02] Hallelujah. It has also come to warn us
[3:08:07] about the impending judgment.
[3:08:11] That's why William preached a message
[3:08:15] indictment.
[3:08:24] the oncoming judgment, the oncoming
[3:08:26] storm.
[3:08:28] He preach messages like that,
[3:08:31] preach the rapture.
[3:08:33] And he says the hope of the bride.
[3:08:37] Why? If you receive this message,
[3:08:41] you will not go in the coming.
[3:08:45] The Bible says there is there for now.
[3:08:48] I like it that everything is of the now.
[3:08:54] Hallelujah.
[3:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:56] &gt;&gt; When it is a season, brother,
[3:08:58] &gt;&gt; we are living in the now
[3:09:01] tomorrow.
[3:09:03] There is better for now.
[3:09:05] No condemnation
[3:09:09] that are in Christ.
[3:09:12] Brother preached a message. Christ is
[3:09:15] the mystery of God revealed.
[3:09:19] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:09:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, he came. God came in flesh, but
[3:09:24] that's the first time. The second time,
[3:09:28] God is having preeminence in a body of
[3:09:30] believers.
[3:09:34] Everything that was in God,
[3:09:37] he powered in Christ. Everything that
[3:09:39] was in Christ
[3:09:41] into the church.
[3:09:44] We are the embodiment of Christ today.
[3:09:49] So now we see judgment is coming.
[3:09:53] We sing the song. Some of you don't know
[3:09:55] the song.
[3:09:57] You know we sing all these new beautiful
[3:10:00] but old songs are powerful.
[3:10:04] Judgement is coming.
[3:10:06] All will be there.
[3:10:09] Maybe we may edit that song.
[3:10:16] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:10:17] &gt;&gt; Some of us will not be before the word
[3:10:20] of God.
[3:10:23] Yes, sir.
[3:10:23] &gt;&gt; We have passed
[3:10:26] from condemnation.
[3:10:28] We have passed from death to life.
[3:10:33] Hallelujah. But in the sense that we
[3:10:36] shall be there to judge,
[3:10:42] not to be judged.
[3:10:45] So we can sing all
[3:10:48] each one receiving
[3:10:51] justly is due.
[3:10:54] Sprinkle your soul
[3:10:57] in the blood of the lamb
[3:11:00] and I will
[3:11:07] I see the blood.
[3:11:10] When
[3:11:12] &gt;&gt; I see the blood
[3:11:14] When I
[3:11:16] see the breath,
[3:11:18] I will pass. I will pass over you.
[3:11:24] &gt;&gt; What is he talking about?
[3:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:28] Hallelujah.
[3:11:28] &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard a phrase called a
[3:11:31] bleeding word?
[3:11:37] &gt;&gt; I feel so good right now. I'm fasting
[3:11:40] with revelation.
[3:11:42] Why? Because in every generation
[3:11:46] there was that bleeding.
[3:11:49] God sends a message
[3:11:52] with a message.
[3:11:55] It will be the Passover.
[3:11:58] The death angel would pass away
[3:12:01] and hit others
[3:12:04] and you would be saved.
[3:12:07] Why? Why? because I receive the word of
[3:12:10] your
[3:12:15] Amen. The word of the day
[3:12:18] exonerates you from the impending. Amen.
[3:12:28] The dreadful day of the Lord is coming.
[3:12:31] Fire is coming. Judgement is coming.
[3:12:35] But some people will not come into the
[3:12:39] judge
[3:12:41] because before the judgment
[3:12:44] already passed
[3:12:46] from death to life
[3:12:49] judgment has already been
[3:12:53] told you are free.
[3:12:57] You are free. Why? Because
[3:13:02] something happened
[3:13:05] between the acceptable
[3:13:09] of judgment
[3:13:11] and the day of vengeance
[3:13:14] in the middle there
[3:13:16] something.
[3:13:20] What is it? God sends a message.
[3:13:25] Hallelujah. Amen. With a message
[3:13:28] warning us.
[3:13:30] There is fire coming
[3:13:34] here. Receive this message
[3:13:38] and be sealed away.
[3:13:44] I've been sealed.
[3:13:46] Sealed.
[3:13:48] Sealed.
[3:13:50] I've been sealed
[3:13:52] by the spirit divine.
[3:13:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[3:13:58] Hallelujah.
[3:13:59] &gt;&gt; I am his and I know they're just looking
[3:14:03] at me.
[3:14:08] &gt;&gt; Why am I sealed?
[3:14:12] I'm not sealed with the same thing the
[3:14:14] Pentecostal
[3:14:19] is different.
[3:14:21] It's a seal of approval.
[3:14:26] If you stay under the altar
[3:14:31] and you receive the word of the hour,
[3:14:34] you are entitled
[3:14:37] to the token.
[3:14:42] He did not say if you have received the
[3:14:45] message of the hour, you have received
[3:14:47] the token,
[3:14:49] you entitled
[3:14:52] the token.
[3:14:54] In other words, we are the people.
[3:14:57] Hallelujah.
[3:14:58] &gt;&gt; We are the bride. We are entitled to
[3:15:02] talking.
[3:15:04] We must be sealed away
[3:15:06] from the world. They say they sealed by
[3:15:09] the Holy Sp.
[3:15:11] And yet their women still dress like
[3:15:16] they paint themselves like Jezebel.
[3:15:19] The men go around marrying this man.
[3:15:24] Why? Because they not sealed away.
[3:15:28] But if you sealed away by the power of
[3:15:31] the Holy something happened,
[3:15:34] something changes.
[3:15:36] Amen. And you receive a new natur.
[3:15:43] Even all your sins in the past
[3:15:47] don't count anymore.
[3:15:51] Oh, sister. I talk about pure grace.
[3:16:01] &gt;&gt; See, let's go through this now.
[3:16:05] To proclaim the acceptable year of the
[3:16:06] Lord
[3:16:08] and the day of vengeance
[3:16:12] of our God and to comfort all the
[3:16:14] people.
[3:16:16] Now go to four. Jesus comes
[3:16:22] And there was delivered unto him this
[3:16:24] book
[3:16:26] after reading it. He read only up to the
[3:16:30] first part
[3:16:33] and he left out the other part because
[3:16:36] that was about him
[3:16:38] but for another season
[3:16:42] and that season is about to come
[3:16:45] and he closed the book. He gave it to
[3:16:48] the minister. He sat down and all eyes
[3:16:51] were fasted on him.
[3:16:54] And he began to speak unto them this day
[3:16:58] in this scripture fulfilled.
[3:17:01] One verse was speaking about two coming.
[3:17:06] But you see my friends before his first
[3:17:09] coming
[3:17:10] before his second coming there is
[3:17:13] another promised prophecy.
[3:17:18] Am I preaching to someone here?
[3:17:21] I want you to see Malachi.
[3:17:25] Open to Malachi 4:5.
[3:17:49] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[3:17:50] prophet before the coming of the great
[3:17:53] and dreadful day of the Lord. And he
[3:17:55] shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[3:18:01] to the children, and the heart of the
[3:18:03] children to their fathers, lest I come
[3:18:05] and smite the earth with a curse.
[3:18:20] Okay. Now, saints, I want you to see
[3:18:21] this.
[3:18:23] This
[3:18:26] is something the world doesn't know.
[3:18:31] Behold, I'll do what?
[3:18:34] Who will he send?
[3:18:36] Come on, church. Who?
[3:18:39] Elijah the prophet.
[3:18:41] &gt;&gt; When is he sending him?
[3:18:44] &gt;&gt; Before.
[3:18:46] Not after,
[3:18:47] &gt;&gt; but before.
[3:18:49] &gt;&gt; Before what?
[3:18:51] &gt;&gt; The coming of what?
[3:18:58] Before the coming of what?
[3:19:01] The bread and the fruit of the Lord.
[3:19:04] How many days are those?
[3:19:09] Two days.
[3:19:11] One verse. Two days.
[3:19:19] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[3:19:20] &gt;&gt; you better say exactly what I'm saying.
[3:19:22] Amen. Cuz this is
[3:19:25] Hallelujah. You see the great and
[3:19:28] dreadful day of the Lord.
[3:19:33] The first day
[3:19:35] is what?
[3:19:37] Great. The second day is what?
[3:19:42] The great day is the acceptable year,
[3:19:49] the first coming of the Messiah.
[3:19:52] But the dreadful day
[3:19:55] is the day of judgment
[3:19:57] is is is what in Isaiah
[3:20:01] is called a day of vengeance.
[3:20:04] If you have understood it, say amen.
[3:20:08] All right. Now, these are two days.
[3:20:12] The first coming of the Lord
[3:20:15] and the second coming of
[3:20:17] the first coming,
[3:20:19] we have seen Jesus coming and he
[3:20:22] proclaimed it already. But there is
[3:20:24] another day.
[3:20:27] And he shall turn what what shall he do
[3:20:30] when he comes?
[3:20:32] And he shall turn the hearts of the f
[3:20:34] the fathers to the children.
[3:20:37] and the hearts of the children to their
[3:20:39] fathers.
[3:20:41] Amen. Amen. Amen. Listen, listen. Follow
[3:20:42] me closely. When Elijah comes,
[3:20:46] Elijah is coming
[3:20:49] before two days.
[3:20:52] The first day is the great day.
[3:20:54] The second day is a dreadful day.
[3:20:58] Four brothers come here right quick.
[3:21:01] Young people, too short and too tall.
[3:21:04] Help
[3:21:06] me preach this church.
[3:21:08] Praise God. All right.
[3:21:12] If you don't, I'll I'll call. If you
[3:21:13] don't come, I'll call you.
[3:21:18] First people,
[3:21:21] &gt;&gt; I want another tall one. One one of you.
[3:21:24] You go, brother. You You told you're
[3:21:27] short. I don't understand.
[3:21:30] Okay. This pair is good.
[3:21:35] This side. This side.
[3:21:38] Thank you, brother.
[3:21:42] &gt;&gt; Good. Now,
[3:21:44] &gt;&gt; give it space. Give it space.
[3:21:47] Stand close to one another.
[3:21:50] All right. See this?
[3:21:53] Close. Close. Close.
[3:21:55] Now, I want to demonstrate this for you
[3:21:59] so you can understand. We have seen in
[3:22:01] the Bible the two comingings of the
[3:22:03] Messiah
[3:22:05] the first coming and the second coming.
[3:22:09] This coming is great
[3:22:11] and the other one is what?
[3:22:14] Dreadful. Has this one happened yet?
[3:22:20] Yes or no?
[3:22:23] Yes or no? He has already come
[3:22:28] to do what? to declare the acceptable
[3:22:31] year,
[3:22:34] the year of jubile,
[3:22:36] but also he's coming.
[3:22:39] Has this one come yet?
[3:22:42] We are waiting for him until now.
[3:22:45] He's coming soon.
[3:22:48] Amen. Now the Bible has now said in in
[3:22:53] the prophets of Malachi
[3:22:55] before he come
[3:22:58] oh
[3:23:00] before his great day
[3:23:03] and before his dreadful day.
[3:23:07] Elijah is coming.
[3:23:12] Shout it out.
[3:23:14] Elijah is coming.
[3:23:17] Is there Elijah the Messiah?
[3:23:22] &gt;&gt; Is Elijah our savior?
[3:23:26] But who is he? He's a messenger.
[3:23:31] He's coming to do a certain work.
[3:23:35] He's coming to usher in the Messiah.
[3:23:42] Now, the first coming of the Messiah,
[3:23:46] Elijah came. I have a question for you,
[3:23:48] church. Did the people understand who he
[3:23:52] was?
[3:23:57] Brother Ivan,
[3:23:59] &gt;&gt; I'll have you know that when this Elijah
[3:24:02] came,
[3:24:03] he was a very funny guy
[3:24:06] and the people didn't like him
[3:24:09] because you see, he was eating wild
[3:24:12] honey
[3:24:14] and also locusts.
[3:24:17] He also had red lo.
[3:24:22] His father was a priest.
[3:24:25] called Zechariah and his mother called
[3:24:27] Elizabeth.
[3:24:29] But this guy rebelled and he went in the
[3:24:32] forest.
[3:24:34] Yet his family are priests.
[3:24:38] Where was God when this child was going?
[3:24:44] What you would say? Are you honest?
[3:24:47] Where was God? God was there.
[3:24:51] God was preparing his prophet.
[3:24:55] Because God
[3:24:57] likes using things which cannot be
[3:24:59] understood to confuse the wisdom of
[3:25:02] those who think are wise.
[3:25:10] Because the believers are usually simple
[3:25:12] in heart.
[3:25:16] Believers don't use reasoning.
[3:25:20] Believers use faith.
[3:25:24] And John
[3:25:26] became a very confused guy in the
[3:25:28] forest.
[3:25:32] Amen. I tell you what, sister. He came
[3:25:35] out of the forest with a message which
[3:25:38] is confused.
[3:25:42] Because the priests were saying
[3:25:44] something else
[3:25:47] and he was saying something else.
[3:25:50] Repent.
[3:25:54] funny guy.
[3:25:56] Very offending message,
[3:25:59] but he was God's man.
[3:26:02] He was carrying
[3:26:04] the vision
[3:26:07] of God for that season,
[3:26:10] ministering in the power and spirit of
[3:26:14] Elijah.
[3:26:18] &gt;&gt; Let's now go to the scriptures.
[3:26:21] Today you are preaching with me
[3:26:24] and don't worry 15 minutes I'll be done
[3:26:29] not finished but I I'll quit. Okay.
[3:26:31] Behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[3:26:35] before the what? The great day of the
[3:26:38] Lord.
[3:26:40] This one is this one.
[3:26:44] And he shall turn the heart of the
[3:26:45] father
[3:26:48] to the what?
[3:26:50] the children.
[3:26:53] Do you have a projector? No. Matthew
[3:26:55] 11:13,
[3:26:58] all the prophets
[3:27:00] and the law prophesy
[3:27:03] until John.
[3:27:06] And if ye will receive it,
[3:27:09] this is Jesus speaking.
[3:27:12] This
[3:27:14] was for the the Elijah which was
[3:27:19] he that has ears
[3:27:21] let him hear.
[3:27:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[3:27:25] telling the Pharisees
[3:27:27] please come back telling the Pharisees
[3:27:30] this one is the Elijah which was
[3:27:35] yet John himself said I'm not
[3:27:39] but Jesus declared him
[3:27:42] Why? Because the fact is he's not
[3:27:46] Elijah.
[3:27:47] But the fact is he's Elijah.
[3:27:54] &gt;&gt; His name was John.
[3:27:56] &gt;&gt; But he was working under the anointing
[3:28:01] and the spirit of Elijah.
[3:28:05] What was his job?
[3:28:09] Luke 1 13.
[3:28:12] But the angel said unto him, "Fear not
[3:28:13] Zakarias,
[3:28:15] for thy prayer is heard. Thy wife
[3:28:17] Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and
[3:28:20] thou shalt call his name,
[3:28:23] joy,
[3:28:24] and thou shall have joy and gladness,
[3:28:28] and they shall rejoice at his birth,
[3:28:31] and he shall have be great in the sight,
[3:28:34] and will drink neither drink wine nor
[3:28:36] strongly
[3:28:38] And they shall be filled with the Holy
[3:28:39] Ghost, even from his mother's womb, and
[3:28:43] many of the children of Israel
[3:28:47] shall return to the Lord their God.
[3:28:50] And he shall go before
[3:28:54] him.
[3:28:59] It is in the Bible. And he shall go
[3:29:00] before him
[3:29:02] in the power and in the spirit of
[3:29:05] Elijah.
[3:29:09] This one shall go before you shall go
[3:29:13] before the Messiah
[3:29:15] in the power and in the spirit of a
[3:29:18] light and many of the children shall
[3:29:22] return to rather and and shall and then
[3:29:26] he says uh to turn the hearts of the
[3:29:28] fathers
[3:29:30] to the children.
[3:29:34] Listen to me. Do you remember what it
[3:29:36] said in Malachi 4
[3:29:40] vers 6? If you know it, say it
[3:29:45] louder.
[3:29:47] And he shall turn the hearts
[3:29:50] of the fathers to the children,
[3:29:57] the hearts of the children to the
[3:29:58] fathers.
[3:30:00] right here in the book of Luke when he's
[3:30:03] giving the testament of the ministry of
[3:30:05] John
[3:30:08] did you hear anything like father
[3:30:10] shouldn't father
[3:30:16] your amens are very weak
[3:30:19] you are either doing this Bible study or
[3:30:20] you are not
[3:30:26] praise
[3:30:32] See
[3:30:34] what did he say in Malachi?
[3:30:39] He shall turn
[3:30:41] the hearts of the fathers. Look at it in
[3:30:43] your Bible. The heart
[3:30:46] to children and the hearts of the
[3:30:48] children to father.
[3:30:52] But now he has come
[3:30:54] Elijah.
[3:30:56] And the Bible is saying in Luke 1 17, he
[3:31:01] shall go before him in the spirit and
[3:31:02] power of Elijah
[3:31:04] to turn the hearts of the fathers
[3:31:08] to the
[3:31:11] disobedient to the wisdom of the just.
[3:31:18] They disobedient
[3:31:21] to turn them to the wisdom of God.
[3:31:25] They just shall live by faith.
[3:31:30] John was doing that in his ministry. Do
[3:31:35] you see any gap that says fathers to
[3:31:37] children
[3:31:38] fathers?
[3:31:43] Why?
[3:31:47] Because
[3:31:49] that part
[3:31:51] was for another season,
[3:31:54] not for the days of John.
[3:31:57] It was for the season that he was
[3:31:59] coming.
[3:32:02] But John only turned the hearts of the
[3:32:05] what? The fathers.
[3:32:08] Who are these fathers? He turned the
[3:32:11] Pharisees.
[3:32:13] They were the fathers of the law.
[3:32:16] He turned their heart
[3:32:19] to Christ, from the law, to grace. It
[3:32:24] was something new.
[3:32:27] That's why everywhere you see the
[3:32:28] ministry of John spoken about in the
[3:32:29] Bible.
[3:32:33] He's using the word prepare.
[3:32:37] Prepare.
[3:32:38] Prepare. Prepare. Brother, let me ask
[3:32:41] you, sister.
[3:32:43] What does prepare mean?
[3:32:50] Praise God.
[3:32:53] Where is little David?
[3:32:58] Is he in?
[3:33:05] Now I want to ask you a question. Come.
[3:33:10] Give us a the difference between prepare
[3:33:12] and restore.
[3:33:17] I want us to really learn this. Keep in
[3:33:19] mind
[3:33:23] prepare restore. What's the difference?
[3:33:26] So prepare is like
[3:33:31] I'm going I'm preparing myself maybe to
[3:33:33] do my exams. I'm preparing myself maybe
[3:33:35] to go to church. And then restore is
[3:33:38] bringing back something or taking back
[3:33:40] something to its original place.
[3:33:42] &gt;&gt; So which means prepare
[3:33:46] something. You are preparing something
[3:33:48] which was not there before.
[3:33:52] You preparing for something
[3:33:56] you
[3:33:58] restore
[3:33:59] is it new?
[3:34:02] No. You are bringing back what was
[3:34:04] already there.
[3:34:09] Now
[3:34:11] this John was supposed to do what?
[3:34:15] Prepare. Everybody say prepare.
[3:34:18] &gt;&gt; Come on say prepare.
[3:34:20] &gt;&gt; Church. We are learning. You must go to
[3:34:23] the rapture whether you want or not.
[3:34:28] The Bible says to know him is life.
[3:34:33] You are not going to the rapture by
[3:34:34] mistake.
[3:34:43] God doesn't matter how you die.
[3:34:47] Is where you are going.
[3:34:50] So he said my servant come home.
[3:34:54] And this woman he was very angry with
[3:34:56] him. And he they ordered for him to be
[3:34:59] cut.
[3:35:02] ated him and he left the scene.
[3:35:07] He had done his work.
[3:35:09] He didn't come back. Why?
[3:35:13] And now the Messiah came.
[3:35:16] But when the Messiah came
[3:35:19] still, the people
[3:35:21] were confused.
[3:35:23] They did not know that John was the
[3:35:26] Elijah.
[3:35:30] But when the Messiah came,
[3:35:33] he started revealing it slowly slowly.
[3:35:37] And one time, they went on a mountain to
[3:35:39] pray
[3:35:41] with a few of his disciples.
[3:35:44] Even they did not know who Jesus is.
[3:35:47] They thought he was a good teacher.
[3:35:50] They did not know he was the Messiah.
[3:35:52] Do you know you can be with him and you
[3:35:54] don't know who he is?
[3:35:59] The message is Christ.
[3:36:01] You don't know what you have.
[3:36:03] Christ is here among us.
[3:36:07] Oh my god. And they ask I'm trying to
[3:36:09] wind up a question.
[3:36:12] Who then?
[3:36:15] Why did they then say that? Okay. Give
[3:36:18] me the the verses now.
[3:36:21] Since it is teaching, you must get it
[3:36:22] very well.
[3:36:26] Matthew 17
[3:36:28] vers 10 quickly brother. And his
[3:36:32] disciples asked him,
[3:36:35] saying,
[3:36:36] why then said the scribe that the liars
[3:36:39] must first.
[3:36:48] Some of you who don't know what we're
[3:36:49] talking about,
[3:36:52] they went on the mountain to pray.
[3:36:56] And the disciples saw
[3:36:58] Jesus transfigured.
[3:37:01] He was in a cloud.
[3:37:04] They saw Moses. They saw Elijah on the
[3:37:07] sides.
[3:37:11] Now the scripture says the dead in
[3:37:13] Christ
[3:37:15] shall rise fast. We which are alive and
[3:37:17] remain shall be caught up
[3:37:21] and shall meet them
[3:37:24] and and then shall together we shall
[3:37:25] meet the Lord
[3:37:27] and we shall ever be with him.
[3:37:29] So they knew that this is the order.
[3:37:33] This is the order of resurrection.
[3:37:38] Moses was typing those who are
[3:37:45] Moses died not. So
[3:37:47] did Elijah die?
[3:37:50] &gt;&gt; So Elijah was typing those who did not
[3:37:52] die.
[3:37:55] But they were all changed in the cloud
[3:37:59] with Jesus also speaking.
[3:38:03] They received the revelation.
[3:38:05] So you are the Messiah.
[3:38:07] How long you have been?
[3:38:10] And now they remembered the prophecy.
[3:38:14] What? Before the coming of the what? The
[3:38:17] great day.
[3:38:21] Elijah.
[3:38:29] We don't see Elijah.
[3:38:31] Where is El? He had already come and
[3:38:33] gone.
[3:38:37] Jesus answered, "Give me the next."
[3:38:42] And Jesus answered, "And say unto
[3:38:53] you are the one now answering."
[3:38:58] and
[3:39:01] &gt;&gt; Elias truly shall first come and
[3:39:03] restores all things.
[3:39:11] Wait, this is a bit different.
[3:39:16] Did this Elijah restore anything?
[3:39:22] Sisters, are you following?
[3:39:25] Did Elijah restore Answer
[3:39:29] me church.
[3:39:31] What did he do?
[3:39:34] Prepare.
[3:39:36] Okay. So Jesus must be talking of
[3:39:39] another.
[3:39:43] You must be talking
[3:39:48] because when this one come he shall
[3:39:51] restore also.
[3:39:53] Let me show you another right in that
[3:39:56] verse.
[3:39:57] Is it future tense, past tense?
[3:40:04] Those who studed English now show us.
[3:40:07] This is where English helps. I have
[3:40:09] spoken with people sometimes even
[3:40:12] pastors
[3:40:15] and they really get mad.
[3:40:19] This already happened. And I said
[3:40:22] brothers
[3:40:25] will come or what came is it past or
[3:40:28] future tense
[3:40:31] even this brother can tell
[3:40:35] truly shall
[3:40:39] future past
[3:40:46] and when he shall come
[3:40:49] we restore
[3:40:51] The disciples were like,
[3:40:55] "What are you talking about?"
[3:40:59] They were really amazed. They didn't
[3:41:01] understand.
[3:41:08] They not understanding it.
[3:41:11] And now here
[3:41:14] 12.
[3:41:16] But
[3:41:20] do you remember the other one? And
[3:41:26] now he says
[3:41:29] in Ethiopian language we say
[3:41:35] that one is the best one for me because
[3:41:38] it feels like as if after this one there
[3:41:40] is something else happening.
[3:41:49] I say unto you
[3:41:53] that Elias
[3:41:55] has come already
[3:42:00] but I've done unto him whatsoever they
[3:42:02] listed
[3:42:04] and they knew him not
[3:42:09] and when he had said that go to the next
[3:42:11] verse
[3:42:13] then
[3:42:17] now get it.
[3:42:19] It was
[3:42:24] &gt;&gt; But they still missed this one.
[3:42:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Until today, they
[3:42:33] still miss this one.
[3:42:36] The Pharisees of today.
[3:42:42] Amen.
[3:42:43] Hallelujah. Amen. They still miss him.
[3:42:47] But Jesus said the liars truly shall
[3:42:54] come and restore all things.
[3:42:58] Common knowledge should tell you
[3:43:01] the Baptist restored nothing.
[3:43:05] Common knowledge should tell you
[3:43:08] the day of this Messiah
[3:43:10] was not dreadful
[3:43:12] but it was great.
[3:43:15] Hallelujah.
[3:43:17] &gt;&gt; And all those who received the
[3:43:19] Johnaptism,
[3:43:22] they accepted the Messiah.
[3:43:25] &gt;&gt; So the real vision was
[3:43:28] for John the Baptist to usher in the
[3:43:32] Messiah.
[3:43:35] That was the vision. And when he came,
[3:43:38] John the Baptist said, "I am now I I I
[3:43:43] decreased myself
[3:43:45] and he is lifted up.
[3:43:47] &gt;&gt; He shall be increased. I shall be
[3:43:48] decreed."
[3:43:51] Why? Because he understood.
[3:43:53] It is him the Messiah.
[3:43:56] Behold the lamb of God.
[3:44:01] I'm not even worthy to untie.
[3:44:05] Why? It was the vision of John
[3:44:08] was not to make another religion
[3:44:13] to make another denomination
[3:44:16] to build another church
[3:44:18] to start some organization
[3:44:23] to bring forth
[3:44:25] the Messiah.
[3:44:28] That was the vision.
[3:44:30] And the Messiah came and he did his work
[3:44:34] and left.
[3:44:38] Now the whole world, oh my God,
[3:44:42] is talking about this.
[3:44:46] They don't even have an idea
[3:44:49] that he's coming again.
[3:44:54] They only talk about this one. Jesus is
[3:44:57] good. You know, God is good.
[3:45:00] Sisters, don't you worry how you dress
[3:45:05] cuz God,
[3:45:08] our God doesn't dress.
[3:45:11] He's a God full of love.
[3:45:14] He just want you to make to make you
[3:45:16] feel love.
[3:45:19] Just dress any way you want
[3:45:22] because God
[3:45:25] doesn't see on the out.
[3:45:28] He only sees your eyes
[3:45:31] and he died for you.
[3:45:34] He loves you.
[3:45:36] Just hug your brother.
[3:45:40] Tell them I love you.
[3:45:42] Free love for Jesus.
[3:45:52] That's the Jesus they want to preach.
[3:45:55] They don't know the seasons have
[3:45:56] shifted.
[3:45:59] the one who came as a kinsman.
[3:46:03] He's coming again.
[3:46:06] Why is coming as a judge?
[3:46:10] He's coming to revenge. Rather
[3:46:14] all those who refuse to believe
[3:46:19] in Malachi. He said, "Behold,
[3:46:23] the day cometh
[3:46:25] and shall burn as an orphan
[3:46:29] all the proud and all that do wicked
[3:46:33] shall be stable."
[3:46:36] Give me the first
[3:46:38] praise God. Why? Because they refuse to
[3:46:42] believe the word.
[3:46:44] If you not walk in the laws of God,
[3:46:49] it doesn't stop there.
[3:46:50] He continues on and he say unto you
[3:46:55] hear my name
[3:46:58] son of righteous
[3:47:00] arise
[3:47:03] in his wings.
[3:47:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. The day
[3:47:09] cometh
[3:47:11] shall burn.
[3:47:13] But you know what? When he comes before
[3:47:16] he comes to buy up things,
[3:47:19] he comes to take amen his purchase
[3:47:22] possession.
[3:47:29] That is me. He come to take his bride
[3:47:33] away. Amen. He come to take her
[3:47:36] redeemer.
[3:47:39] He comes to claim her.
[3:47:41] The one who redeemed you
[3:47:44] will claim you.
[3:47:49] Let me be honest. There are certain
[3:47:52] things even when you know you are saved.
[3:47:56] They refuse to go.
[3:47:59] You are fighting. Maybe I'm speaking to
[3:48:02] some of you. I'm fighting pastor. I'm
[3:48:04] fighting. Don't worry. The one who
[3:48:07] purchased you will claim you.
[3:48:15] Hallelujah.
[3:48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will claim you coming back
[3:48:19] again. Amen. And to take us away
[3:48:23] us away to change our body this
[3:48:27] mortality
[3:48:29] put on immortality.
[3:48:32] But before he come, before the dreadful
[3:48:34] day, before the shall burn as an off,
[3:48:40] he has promised
[3:48:41] another Elijah.
[3:48:45] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:48:46] &gt;&gt; He said this Elijah
[3:48:48] will do what?
[3:48:52] To restore all things.
[3:48:56] And this one is called in Malachi 46
[3:49:01] the second part.
[3:49:04] And he shall turn the hearts of
[3:49:09] again.
[3:49:15] Let's say it again in English. One more
[3:49:17] time.
[3:49:22] &gt;&gt; All right. I think you got it.
[3:49:25] Turn the hearts of the children
[3:49:29] to their fathers.
[3:49:31] Who are the children? Who are the
[3:49:33] children? I am the child of God.
[3:49:36] We are the children of God. The spirit
[3:49:39] of God in our heart.
[3:49:44] We are the children of God. The end time
[3:49:47] church.
[3:49:51] The end time church.
[3:49:54] As all these denominations,
[3:49:56] religions
[3:49:58] perverted,
[3:50:00] the faith,
[3:50:02] they have changed the teachings.
[3:50:05] And yet this teaching
[3:50:07] is Jesus Christ. Paul said, we have laid
[3:50:11] a foundation. No man can lay another
[3:50:15] foundation. And we have laid Jesus
[3:50:18] Christ. But you see when they teach
[3:50:21] another gospel
[3:50:23] which is not another gospel, they take
[3:50:25] this
[3:50:27] take this Bible
[3:50:30] and they teach another
[3:50:33] they teach another
[3:50:46] Paul under the anointing
[3:50:49] placed a curse
[3:50:51] on all the false teachers.
[3:50:54] So today these false teachers are not in
[3:50:57] shrines.
[3:51:00] The false teachers are not in B. The
[3:51:04] false teachers. They look like me. They
[3:51:07] on a pullpit wearing a nectar and a
[3:51:11] beautiful suit and a microphone
[3:51:14] a bunch of lies.
[3:51:18] They're like me. The way I look, but
[3:51:21] when they begin to talk, they talk,
[3:51:24] deceiving, lying,
[3:51:30] I thank God, but we still have churches
[3:51:34] without preachers who will preach the
[3:51:37] truth,
[3:51:38] the truth without glass.
[3:51:44] And this Elijah in the end time
[3:51:48] is the seventh messenger also
[3:51:52] when he come he comes to do what?
[3:51:56] Hallelujah. He doesn't bring another
[3:51:58] religion.
[3:52:01] He doesn't bring another idea.
[3:52:05] He doesn't come to start his own
[3:52:06] denomination.
[3:52:09] He doesn't come to start another church.
[3:52:13] But when this lighter come,
[3:52:15] he is only having one job
[3:52:19] to bring that which is old.
[3:52:23] The stone which was rejected,
[3:52:27] the word
[3:52:29] and bring it back again to the church.
[3:52:33] This Elijah will come and he will say
[3:52:36] God is not three, he's one.
[3:52:41] He's not the one who who preached that
[3:52:42] fast.
[3:52:44] The apostles preached it fast. He will
[3:52:47] come and he will say water baptism
[3:52:50] be done in much water
[3:52:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:52:55] that is already in the Bible.
[3:52:57] It did not start with him. He will come
[3:53:01] and he will say there is nothing like
[3:53:03] women preachers
[3:53:07] and they will call him a woman hater.
[3:53:11] But he will say no. I'm saying what Paul
[3:53:14] said.
[3:53:16] I'm preaching what Paul preach.
[3:53:19] He will say women should not wear this
[3:53:21] makeup and look like Jezebel.
[3:53:26] They should be natural.
[3:53:29] You know believers of these days who
[3:53:30] believe the message of this Elijah.
[3:53:35] Do you know what they do in normal days?
[3:53:37] They don't wear makeup.
[3:53:40] They wait for the wedding
[3:53:43] to arrive.
[3:53:45] And then they say, "At least for one
[3:53:46] day,
[3:53:48] let us look like Jezebel."
[3:53:52] Shame on you.
[3:53:54] Shame on anyone who does that.
[3:53:57] Find your bearing in the word of God.
[3:54:03] Quite frankly me, I'm not offended
[3:54:06] when I see someone doing those things. I
[3:54:09] just right now I'm saying it because I
[3:54:10] don't see anyone who is doing it.
[3:54:14] Me I never preach to offend. I preach to
[3:54:15] help.
[3:54:18] But now I'm teaching you as a child.
[3:54:20] When I see someone doing that, I don't
[3:54:23] judge them. I see their spiritual levels
[3:54:26] of maturity.
[3:54:33] and I love them anyhow.
[3:54:35] Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. But this Elijah,
[3:54:40] you know, spoke against those things.
[3:54:43] He spoke against men wearing shorts
[3:54:49] and they go in the shopping mall.
[3:54:54] I hope I not touch something.
[3:55:00] brothers.
[3:55:02] Imagine a brother.
[3:55:04] Okay. Okay. Can you imagine
[3:55:07] me coming here with a short
[3:55:14] I can't imagine someone I can't imagine
[3:55:18] and you at your home moving around your
[3:55:22] neighborhood
[3:55:27] you undress before your children
[3:55:31] even women do it.
[3:55:34] These days you find even mothers going
[3:55:36] to shower with their children.
[3:55:40] It's a very obscene generation.
[3:55:43] But Elijah came and splashed
[3:55:48] said we have a standard.
[3:55:51] We believe in holiness.
[3:55:53] The standard of the word is our
[3:55:55] standard.
[3:55:57] It's not because it is hard or easy.
[3:56:00] It is because it is the word.
[3:56:04] modest up.
[3:56:07] You are a Christian
[3:56:09] of God.
[3:56:12] Praise God. And so friends, you know, he
[3:56:15] came and preached about the serpent sea.
[3:56:19] They started with him
[3:56:21] with the disciples
[3:56:23] right in the New Testament. They talked
[3:56:26] about it.
[3:56:28] By there's nothing this Elijah will
[3:56:30] preach that is new.
[3:56:34] He only brings revelation to things
[3:56:35] which are already.
[3:56:39] And this Elijah is coming before the
[3:56:43] judgment
[3:56:44] is coming.
[3:56:46] And his vision is one
[3:56:49] just like the first Elijah.
[3:56:52] Vision is to point people to Christ.
[3:56:59] But people come maneuvering with
[3:57:01] political spirits,
[3:57:07] they begin to say William.
[3:57:13] They don't understand
[3:57:15] what qualifies a prophet.
[3:57:20] It's the word. He must do what the Bible
[3:57:23] say,
[3:57:27] brothers.
[3:57:29] I say
[3:57:31] this Elijah has come
[3:57:35] not many people know
[3:57:38] only a few
[3:57:42] and these ones who know they are the
[3:57:44] ones preparing themselves
[3:57:47] for his coming.
[3:57:49] God bless you.
[3:57:59] Now as I am closing
[3:58:02] I read this sometime but I'm going to
[3:58:04] read you a quote of a disclaimer that
[3:58:06] brother William Brham gives
[3:58:12] the resume of ages. Not for one moment
[3:58:16] do I bring a message to the people that
[3:58:17] they may follow me
[3:58:20] or join my church or start some
[3:58:22] fellowship and organization.
[3:58:24] I have never done that and I will not do
[3:58:27] that. I have no interest in those
[3:58:29] things. But I do have interest in the
[3:58:31] things of God and the people.
[3:58:35] And if I can accomplish
[3:58:38] one thing,
[3:58:41] I will be satisfied.
[3:58:44] That one thing is to see established a
[3:58:48] true spiritual relationship between God
[3:58:50] and man.
[3:58:58] wherein men become new creations in
[3:59:00] Christ
[3:59:03] filled with his spirit and live
[3:59:05] according to his word.
[3:59:09] That's the vision of this message.
[3:59:14] That's our vision.
[3:59:17] It was the vision of William Brana
[3:59:20] as the message of the last
[3:59:22] What is it
[3:59:24] to introduce people to Christ?
[3:59:31] Religion introduces you to a set of
[3:59:33] rules.
[3:59:39] But Christ introduces you to his life,
[3:59:44] his character, his nature which makes
[3:59:48] you live like him.
[3:59:52] We've not received a religion.
[3:59:57] We've been introduced to Christ.
[4:00:00] This message, that's why we want to
[4:00:03] print it, to send it out
[4:00:07] is the vision that we have
[4:00:10] to tell someone
[4:00:12] what God has done
[4:00:15] in this day. God bless you.
[4:00:22] Please stand up on your feet.
[4:00:25] And that was only three pages out of
[4:00:27] nine.
[4:00:32] Um, you know, some thoughts I had on
[4:00:33] nine pages. So,
[4:00:38] I don't I'm not yet sure if I'll be
[4:00:39] speaking on Wednesday,
[4:00:43] but if I do, then I'll continue with it.
[4:00:45] If not,
[4:00:48] If not then I'll continue on Sunday.
[4:00:52] You know friends I need you to
[4:00:54] understand
[4:00:56] what we are trying to do.
[4:00:59] We are not trying to build a man's kind
[4:01:01] of thing.
[4:01:04] We are preparing for a greater thing.
[4:01:08] There's a song, an old song is
[4:01:13] &gt;&gt; I don't know if the brothers know it,
[4:01:14] but brother Shalom, if you can get a
[4:01:15] microphone.
[4:01:17] Some of these brothers don't know.
[4:01:37] Did you get the song?
[4:01:45] No. Yeah. Let us try to sing it.
[4:01:52] Some of these old songs are just
[4:01:53] beautiful.
[4:01:56] We ought to sing it from time to time.
[4:01:59] Amen. In these the closing days of time.
[4:02:06] What the glorious hopes are full
[4:02:12] that see a wonderous truth sublime.
[4:02:17] Oh, he shall reign. King of kings and
[4:02:21] lord of lords.
[4:02:23] Will
[4:02:25] is coming soon. He's coming soon.
[4:02:31] Rejoice we welcome his return.
[4:02:36] When it may be morning, it may be night
[4:02:41] or day. We know when you can drop your
[4:02:45] hands. Amen. as a clown offering to him
[4:02:48] where the signs around in the name.
[4:02:55] Oh, painted on the sky
[4:03:00] with God's faithful
[4:03:03] witnesses declare. Amen. That's the
[4:03:07] coming of the Savior. Now, it's coming
[4:03:12] soon. It's coming soon.
[4:03:16] is coming soon with joy. We welcome this
[4:03:22] river.
[4:03:25] It may be
[4:03:29] night or new. We know he's coming soon.
[4:03:35] The dead in Christ. The dead in Christ
[4:03:42] will come. Let's go for
[4:03:50] the water of the sky. He may share
[4:03:57] our parlor
[4:04:00] when he's coming soon. He's coming soon.
[4:04:08] We will return
[4:04:13] maybe
[4:04:19] we know he's coming soon
[4:04:30] where
[4:04:32] shall be a faithful
[4:04:36] Well,
[4:04:38] we shall just
[4:04:41] amen we
[4:04:45] might
[4:04:49] is coming soon is coming soon.
[4:05:01] It may be one. It may be not
[4:05:09] coming soon.
[4:05:15] Amen.
[4:05:18] Oh, I he
[4:05:21] far away
[4:05:24] stood an all
[4:05:28] ragged cross,
[4:05:31] the emblem
[4:05:34] of suffering
[4:05:37] and pain.
[4:05:40] &gt;&gt; I love that old cross.
[4:05:42] I love
[4:05:45] that.
[4:05:48] Where where the deep
[4:05:52] rest and best
[4:05:55] for a while
[4:05:58] of lost s.
[4:06:04] Come on everybody, let us sing it
[4:06:05] together.
[4:06:07] Now I will shareish
[4:06:12] all
[4:06:21] my
[4:06:24] last
[4:06:35] to the All right.
[4:06:44] I
[4:06:47] sound
[4:06:54] Oh, that old red cross.
[4:06:56] Oh, that old
[4:06:59] rocked cross.
[4:07:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, sing it now.
[4:07:03] despised
[4:07:05] by the world. We has a wonderful
[4:07:16] me
[4:07:19] of God.
[4:07:23] You never
[4:08:02] I

[4:08:08] I will
[4:08:24] forever
[4:08:32] in that
[4:08:35] rocked cross. Sing it with our hearts.
[4:08:38] &gt;&gt; Sing it with what you're singing.
[4:08:47] &gt;&gt; Wondous.
[4:09:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus suffer.
[4:09:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus suffer.
[4:09:07] to battle and to sanctify me. You
[4:09:13] save
[4:09:16] me.
[4:09:28] Oh
[4:09:33] my
[4:09:41] I will sing. I will bring to the old
[4:09:45] I will. Oh yes.
[4:09:54] Hallelujah.
[4:10:04] The last time to the old cross
[4:10:09] to the
[4:10:12] rocked cross. I will ever be true. His
[4:10:20] shame and reproach gladly shame
[4:10:28] away.
[4:10:30] &gt;&gt; And he'll call me someday.
[4:10:38] to my home. My home
[4:10:44] where his glory forever is glory.
[4:11:02] Feel
[4:11:09] my
[4:11:12] last.
[4:11:29] Hallelujah.
[4:11:35] Sunday
[4:11:37] for our
[4:11:44] Amen. Let's invite brother Daniel to
[4:11:46] come and close for us in a word of
[4:11:48] prayer. You know, just think about
[4:11:50] Christ in your heart. What he has done
[4:11:52] for you in this day.
[4:11:56] What a wonderful God he is.
[4:11:58] What a wonderful God.
[4:12:01] Amen. Let's just close and just commit
[4:12:04] your need to him. He knows your need.
[4:12:07] &gt;&gt; Let him just speak to you now. Brother,
[4:12:14] let's pray. Heavenly Father, I want to

[4:12:23] life. Oh God, loving Jesus, want to
[4:12:25] thank you for feeding our souls, oh
[4:12:27] Lord, strengthening us, oh Lord, helping
[4:12:31] us, Lord, to focus again, oh God, on the
[4:12:33] vision that, Lord, you've given the man
[4:12:36] of God. Oh God, may you help everyone,
[4:12:38] Lord, to catch up the vision. Oh Lord,
[4:12:41] Lord, it is my prayer, oh God. May we
[4:12:44] work, Lord, as a family. May we work,
[4:12:46] Lord, as a bride, oh God, loving Jesus.
[4:12:49] For you said, Lord, we have a short
[4:12:51] quick work. Heavenly Father, may you
[4:12:53] help everyone, Lord, to come to
[4:12:54] realization of their position. Oh God,
[4:12:58] loving Jesus, we need you as we're
[4:13:00] going, oh Lord. Lord, you've given us
[4:13:02] the word. May we go, Lord, King of his
[4:13:05] father, and really bring it out, oh
[4:13:07] Lord, in our lives, Lord Jesus. We pray,
[4:13:10] heavenly father, give strength to
[4:13:11] everyone, oh Lord. Lord, as we are
[4:13:13] beginning the week, oh Lord Jesus, give
[4:13:15] us strength, oh Lord, to move, Lord, a
[4:13:18] mile again. Oh Lord, help us, oh Lord
[4:13:20] Jesus, until we meet again. Oh God,

[4:13:27] May you renew him, oh God. Give him,
[4:13:30] Lord, more revelation and inspiration,
[4:13:32] oh God, to lead us, heavenly father. You
[4:13:35] bless him here, Lord. I know for a
[4:13:37] reason, oh God. Loving Jesus, help us,
[4:13:40] oh Lord, to really see the vision. Oh
[4:13:42] Lord, as your word has been preached, oh
[4:13:43] Lord, we cannot we cannot thank you
[4:13:46] enough, oh Lord, for what you've done,
[4:13:48] Lord, to our souls, heavenly father.
[4:13:50] Lord Jesus, even the people that have
[4:13:52] been here, oh God, may they go
[4:13:53] meditating about your word, oh God.
[4:13:56] Loving Jesus, we thank you. We bless
[4:13:58] your name, oh heavenly father. Thank
[4:14:01] you, Jesus. We pray through your mighty

[4:14:15] Turn to your neighbor. Tell them God
[4:14:16] bless you. Thank you for coming in the
[4:14:18] house of God.
[4:14:22] We're going to dismiss you now and we
[4:14:23] are planning to meet in a service
[4:14:25] Wednesday evening.
[4:14:38] So um uh we have a Wednesday service
[4:14:44] &gt;&gt; and then on Sunday
[4:14:46] it's a it's a busy month.
[4:14:50] I know for everyone people are taking
[4:14:52] holidays
[4:14:54] and others are traveling and you know
[4:14:57] it's also busy for us in the ministry
[4:15:01] can hold us in prayer.
[4:15:03] &gt;&gt; So uh with me it's been traveling and
[4:15:06] traveling and traveling.
[4:15:08] So
[4:15:10] someone was telling me to slow down
[4:15:14] &gt;&gt; but I was also thinking while that I'm
[4:15:16] young let me use my speed
[4:15:21] in the evening time of my life
[4:15:24] I have nothing to regret of
[4:15:27] let us serve God when we are young
[4:15:30] serve him when you have strength
[4:15:32] and you will have nothing to regret
[4:15:37] and maybe what I wanted to say to the
[4:15:39] church.
[4:15:41] Some of you who have not yet joined um
[4:15:45] you know any group,
[4:15:49] please join a group.
[4:15:52] You've seen the leadersh
[4:15:56] for them to come to you. Go to
[4:16:00] catch the vision.
[4:16:02] Do something. Do something. We don't
[4:16:06] live for going to school, eating, and
[4:16:07] sleeping and dying.
[4:16:12] God gave you that job
[4:16:14] so you can use it to serve him,
[4:16:18] that education so you can use it to
[4:16:21] serve him.
[4:16:22] that marriage so you can use it to serve
[4:16:25] him. So whatever you have, use it to
[4:16:28] serve him. And I can assure you there's
[4:16:31] no one that has ever served God
[4:16:35] and and regretted it. Do you know of any
[4:16:42] serve God with all our heart?
[4:16:45] And I was thinking, Sister Fibbe, you're
[4:16:46] looking for someone to help you.
[4:16:50] I mean like we're talking about it here
[4:16:52] last time
[4:16:53] &gt;&gt; and while sister you were singing sister
[4:16:56] um
[4:16:59] &gt;&gt; no it's very bad for you to call her
[4:17:00] sister Mariam because you may get
[4:17:01] issues.
[4:17:02] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[4:17:04] &gt;&gt; You understand brother Wang?
[4:17:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:17:06] &gt;&gt; So what should you call her?
[4:17:07] &gt;&gt; Sister Mar. Yes. That that sounds
[4:17:10] better.
[4:17:11] &gt;&gt; So sister Mar you could go to sister
[4:17:13] fibbe.
[4:17:16] I don't know whether you have been added
[4:17:18] on any group but I think she might need
[4:17:20] your help.
[4:17:25] It's my recommendation but you go and
[4:17:26] teach.
[4:17:29] Yeah. So but if you all are in one group
[4:17:34] do the best you can
[4:17:36] you know there are some groups you go
[4:17:38] and
[4:17:41] you find someone pledged 5 million
[4:17:45] how much are they given zero
[4:17:50] for 18 is it now 19 week how many weeks
[4:17:55] this week is week what
[4:17:59] 18.
[4:18:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:18:01] &gt;&gt; Zero. Zero. Not
[4:18:03] &gt;&gt; there's a problem. And you find someone
[4:18:06] who has pledged 100,000.
[4:18:08] They've gave it and they still giving
[4:18:09] more.
[4:18:12] So it's not really how much you give.
[4:18:15] You're giving the best you can.
[4:18:18] And what you pledge try and finish it in
[4:18:22] the shortest time possible. So that our
[4:18:25] vision is not to build a church.
[4:18:29] Our vision is to spread this message.
[4:18:32] We need to have a home
[4:18:35] where we can come out of send preachers
[4:18:38] all over this country
[4:18:41] other countries
[4:18:44] and we we we spread this message.
[4:18:47] Is that a man church? So let's do the
[4:18:49] best we can. I appreciate all the young
[4:18:51] people especially the young people.
[4:18:54] that have caught the vision.
[4:18:56] You know, brother Polyup is, you know,
[4:18:58] there. I don't even know where he gets
[4:19:00] there.
[4:19:02] But when him send him something
[4:19:06] is abroad,
[4:19:08] &gt;&gt; Pakistan Pakistan,
[4:19:10] &gt;&gt; but he's still sending. He caught the
[4:19:12] vision.
[4:19:13] But some of you are not.
[4:19:19] What's the problem?
[4:19:21] Let's do this together.
[4:19:24] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor. Let us do it
[4:19:25] together.
[4:19:27] Yes. Let's do this together.
[4:19:29] Don't leave someone to carry the burden
[4:19:30] alone.
[4:19:33] Let's carry the burden together. I've
[4:19:35] had I'm going to have one Sunday
[4:19:39] and prepare it either before the end of
[4:19:41] the year or after the youth.
[4:19:45] I'm going to to call a testimony service
[4:19:47] of 30 minutes.
[4:19:51] Those that have been faithfully given to
[4:19:54] land fund
[4:19:56] And out of it, God did something.
[4:19:59] So prepare those testimonies and
[4:20:02] actually you can begin informing me
[4:20:03] about them.
[4:20:05] We would want you to come and give and
[4:20:08] don't shy away from my testimony.
[4:20:11] Some people
[4:20:17] fear testimony people come and say
[4:20:21] it is your blessing.
[4:20:26] You are free to say God blessed me. It
[4:20:28] is my blessing. Go and give and you get
[4:20:30] your blessing.
[4:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:20:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[4:20:38] Right. We love you so much.
[4:20:40] Let's dismiss you right now. Those who
[4:20:43] are planning to go either to to Toronto
[4:20:47] or to Sister M's here in Campa.
[4:20:51] Sister Ma is here in Campara.
[4:20:54] So not far from the church, but those
[4:20:57] ones are only three people.
[4:21:01] Yeah. So then the other one, is there a
[4:21:04] limit? Sister Ruth, brother,
[4:21:07] &gt;&gt; sister Ruth,
[4:21:10] no limit.
[4:21:14] So anyone who can
[4:21:17] uh see brother Martin
[4:21:19] and let us organize properly. Let's be
[4:21:22] organized.
[4:21:23] So we can know who is going where
[4:21:26] and stand with these two families.
[4:21:29] So God bless you. Invite the brother to
[4:21:32] come and give us a song as it is.
[4:21:44] In the sweet
[4:21:47] by and by
[4:21:50] we shall meet on the beautiful
