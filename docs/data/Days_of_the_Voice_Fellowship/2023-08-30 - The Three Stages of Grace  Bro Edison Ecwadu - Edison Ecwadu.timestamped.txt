[22:49] a few minutes and we see what the Lord
[22:51] has for us tonight
[22:53] Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1
[22:56] reads
[22:58] and he and you has he quickened
[23:01] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[23:04] wearing in times past you walked
[23:06] according to the course of this world
[23:09] according to the prince of the power of
[23:11] the air the spirit that now walketh in
[23:14] the children of Disobedience among whom
[23:17] also we all had our conversations in
[23:20] time past in the last of our flesh
[23:22] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[23:24] of the mind and where by Nature the
[23:27] children of Wrath even us others
[23:30] but God who is rich in Mercy for his
[23:33] great love wherewith he loved us even
[23:35] when we were dead in sin hath quickened
[23:38] us together with Christ Jesus by Grace
[23:41] you are saved
[23:44] father we thank you we have read your
[23:46] word and your word says that the letter
[23:48] kills but your spirit gives life father
[23:51] we pray come and interpret the
[23:52] scriptures we do not know we don't have
[23:54] understanding of the word but father you
[23:57] are your own interpreter we do not want
[24:00] to put our mind in your word but father
[24:02] you come down and interpret your word

[24:07] we bless your name we thank you
[24:09] granted father in Jesus name we pray and
[24:12] believe
[24:13] amen you may be seated in the presence
[24:15] of the Lord
[24:17] I thank God for these uh
[24:19] wonderful uh privilege that uh
[24:22] God has given me to stand before you
[24:24] tonight
[24:25] just to speak
[24:27] a few words that will
[24:29] a few words of encouragement
[24:32] I have not come with something new
[24:34] tonight praise the Lord
[24:36] I have come with that which you already
[24:38] know and just to add on a letter as the
[24:42] spirit of the Lord leads us blessed be
[24:44] the name of the Lord I want to begin
[24:47] with a testimony uh concerning my life
[24:51] ah the uh
[24:53] the biggest miracle
[24:55] that God can do to a man
[24:57] is the Salvation of his soul
[25:00] praise the Lord
[25:02] if not because of Christ
[25:05] I don't know how and where I would be
[25:07] tonight
[25:09] praise the Lord
[25:10] I believe each one of us
[25:13] has got that kind of testimony
[25:15] of how the Lord
[25:18] abandoned the 99
[25:21] and came looking for you one sheep
[25:25] it is because of the grace of God
[25:28] and I thank God that tonight I can stand
[25:31] boldly in his presence
[25:33] not because I am a strong man but
[25:36] because Christ in me is strong
[25:40] Hallelujah
[25:41] I thank God that we are all standing and
[25:44] I'm also standing because Christ stood
[25:47] at Calvary and that's why I am standing
[25:50] the Bible says he became us that we may
[25:53] become him he took up the nature of sin
[25:56] that you may take up his righteousness
[25:59] Hallelujah Christ went to Calvary on
[26:02] your behalf and that is why there is now
[26:04] no more condemnation to those who are in
[26:07] Christ Jesus those who walk not after
[26:10] the will of the flesh Hallelujah I
[26:13] believe we are the children of the
[26:14] spirit led by the Spirit by the grace of
[26:17] God tonight I'm going to talk about
[26:18] Grace
[26:20] the three stages of Grace
[26:23] praise the Lord
[26:25] I'm going to talk about the three stages
[26:26] of Grace now Grace didn't just begin
[26:29] today
[26:30] Grace never begun when you got saved
[26:32] Hallelujah Grace did not start when you
[26:36] heard the word
[26:37] grace started way back even before the
[26:40] world was formed Hallelujah there are
[26:43] three things that God did one
[26:46] God had his four knowledge
[26:50] now sometimes I ask a question have you
[26:53] ever asked yourself that what was there
[26:55] before Genesis 1. have you ever thought
[26:59] that what has been there what was there
[27:02] before Genesis 1 before God said let
[27:05] there be light Let There Be have you
[27:09] ever bothered to think that what was
[27:11] there before
[27:13] God spoke Hallelujah
[27:15] now God had his thoughts he is for our
[27:19] knowledge and in the foreign knowledge
[27:22] of God God saw everything all throughout
[27:26] the seven Church ages blessed be the
[27:29] name of the Lord and I want to tell you
[27:31] according to God's for our knowledge he
[27:34] saw you
[27:35] and that is why you're here
[27:37] because God had seen you back there
[27:41] you never knew you were going to be here
[27:43] tonight but you are here because God had
[27:46] seen you back there in his foreign
[27:48] knowledge and therefore after God had
[27:50] his foreign knowledge he started
[27:52] ordaining things in accordance to his
[27:55] foreign knowledge and that's why God
[27:57] ordained everything there is Hallelujah
[28:02] and according to God's poor knowledge
[28:05] your ordained Grace to be in the place
[28:08] blessed be the name of the Lord
[28:11] because God was not ignorant that there
[28:14] was going to be the fall of Man
[28:17] God in his foreign knowledge so time all
[28:20] throughout the ages until where we are
[28:23] now
[28:24] and everything has to work according to
[28:27] God's foreign knowledge and God's
[28:28] ordination
[28:30] whatever you see taking place now
[28:32] wherever it takes place God saw it
[28:35] before
[28:37] and therefore God had a preparation God
[28:40] had prepared a plan for whatever we see
[28:44] going on now
[28:45] and therefore that's why God cannot fail
[28:49] because God has already prepared a way
[28:53] before there was even one single problem
[28:56] God prepared a way of Escape God
[28:59] prepared healing before there was one
[29:01] disease on Earth
[29:03] God prepared Victory before there was
[29:06] one demon
[29:09] to try you
[29:11] Hallelujah
[29:12] in God's foreign knowledge God knew that
[29:16] you would not thrive in the law
[29:19] and that's why he brought Grace
[29:21] blessed be the name of the Lord
[29:23] you could not attain righteousness
[29:26] through the law
[29:28] so according to God's foreign he had
[29:30] ordained Grace to be
[29:33] and at God's appointed time
[29:35] Grace came at our time Hallelujah
[29:38] because we could only overcome through
[29:41] Grace
[29:43] now I'm going to talk about the three
[29:45] stages of Grace one
[29:48] is justification
[29:50] blessed be the name of the Lord
[29:53] you love the Lord
[29:55] now justification
[29:58] is when God
[30:01] called you
[30:02] let's talk a little about
[30:05] the three things
[30:06] now
[30:08] God
[30:10] the Bible says somewhere that he
[30:13] ordained he chose us in him before the
[30:17] foundation of the world was laid God
[30:19] ordained you a son or daughter before
[30:23] anything was created
[30:26] that means god knew you before anything
[30:30] God had known you and therefore he had
[30:32] ordained you to be a son and the good
[30:35] news is
[30:36] there is nothing the devil can do about
[30:38] it
[30:40] blessed with the name of the Lord
[30:42] if God has ordained you if God ordained
[30:44] you a son or daughter then the devil has
[30:48] been shut out
[30:49] I'll tell you it doesn't matter what the
[30:53] Devil Makes You Do Hallelujah he record
[30:56] change God's program God's plan about
[30:59] your life why because you are a son and
[31:03] a daughter of God
[31:05] I want to just bring a simple example
[31:08] if I am a father and I have a child at
[31:10] home
[31:11] and that child is very rebellious
[31:14] that's the one to do what I tell him
[31:16] when I try to rebuke him tomorrow does
[31:18] the same thing
[31:19] does that mean that that child is not my
[31:22] child
[31:25] Hallelujah
[31:27] now
[31:28] because the tempter is still here with
[31:30] us
[31:31] because we are still in flesh
[31:33] brother sister
[31:35] the devil is going to try to make you do
[31:37] things that are contrary to the word of
[31:39] God but God has had a way of Grace to
[31:42] bring you back
[31:44] to his word
[31:46] and therefore the devil is defeated why
[31:50] because Grace has prevailed
[31:52] blessed be the name of the Lord
[31:54] now
[31:56] the three stages of Grace not everyone
[31:59] can be able to go through them
[32:02] Hallelujah
[32:04] there are a special category of people
[32:06] who are ordained to complete the race
[32:11] there is a special category of people
[32:13] who are going to go through all the
[32:15] three stages but some will not go
[32:18] through all
[32:20] now remember uh
[32:22] uh in the book of Exodus when the
[32:25] children of Israel
[32:26] left Egypt
[32:32] that was their justification
[32:36] God was calling them out of the world of
[32:40] Egypt
[32:43] Hallelujah and it was a very big
[32:45] congregation
[32:47] very many people moved out of Egypt
[32:51] and they walked there when they saw the
[32:54] goodness of the Lord never again the
[32:56] pillar of fire leading them at night
[33:10] and that's how the church is tonight
[33:15] many are called but few are chosen
[33:18] many people today come to Salvation
[33:21] so many so many come as a group by
[33:26] as well
[33:27] you seek Miracles the word of God being
[33:31] Vindicated
[33:34] and everyone is a Christian

[33:44] when they get to the Wilderness
[33:47] Hallelujah that is where the true seed
[33:51] of God is sin
[33:52] then
[33:54] the Bible tells us not all of them cross
[33:56] the Wilderness
[33:59] because of their unbelief
[34:02] God made them to move
[34:05] rotate in the wilderness
[34:12] praise the Lord

[44:37] Times
[44:38] that you were still living in sins that
[44:42] is
[44:48] close to that chapter

[1:08:03] convinced
[1:08:05] When you pray for somebody
[1:08:07] and that person gets healed
[1:08:19] the character
[1:08:21] is what is needed this is
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:29] actually deny the Christ
[1:08:31] without the Holy Ghost
[1:08:33] praise the Lord the apostles
[1:08:40] they came to Jesus

[1:09:25] know and moreover they didn't have the
[1:09:28] Holy Ghost at that time

[1:11:56] persecution without the holy ghosts
[1:12:02] am I speaking to human beings
[1:12:14] we've got to go through all the three
[1:12:16] stages

[1:12:22] wilderness
[1:12:23] [Music]

[1:12:31] and our Promised Land
[1:12:36] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:12:41] who was saying
[1:12:43] he was saying two laws are struggling
[1:12:45] within him
[1:12:47] when he wants to do Christ truth is when
[1:12:50] that's wrong Hallelujah
[1:12:55] he even said I think in the Book of
[1:12:57] Romans
[1:12:58] what do you think
[1:13:01] the Lord Thrice yeah I besought the Lord
[1:13:04] Thrice
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:07] that it may depart from me
[1:13:11] brother sister
[1:13:14] you know what Jesus what God told him
[1:13:17] he said my grace is sufficient
[1:13:25] brother sister the grace of God is
[1:13:29] sufficient for you
[1:13:32] blessed be the name of the Lord if the
[1:13:35] grace of God is sufficient for you
[1:13:37] then you would say Amen to that oh
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:14:07] that is not the end of the road
[1:14:10] again though
[1:14:14] foreign
[1:14:30] [Music]
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:47] foreign
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:31] it doesn't matter how slow it may be so
[1:15:34] much
[1:15:36] before the Rapture takes place
[1:15:43] amazing
[1:15:45] why because
[1:15:46] God had you in history
[1:15:50] before God said later
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:15:59] and God had prepared cartoon
[1:16:03] where on how you are going to overcome
[1:16:08] you didn't just appear here by mistake
[1:16:12] you didn't just happen on Earth
[1:16:16] there was somebody who planned for you
[1:16:18] before
[1:16:21] so God has prepared your life
[1:16:24] all the programming of your life
[1:16:28] and you've got to do everything
[1:16:30] according to that
[1:16:31] because
[1:16:33] there is nothing you can do to change it
[1:16:37] that's why the Bible says it is not what
[1:16:41] we we we became
[1:16:43] foreign
[1:17:24] you see
[1:17:26] the random says
[1:17:28] maybe I should chip this as a conclude
[1:17:31] now
[1:17:32] this is the greatest gift
[1:17:37] that God has ever sent to the world
[1:17:42] is Jesus Christ
[1:17:47] the greatest gift that God sent to
[1:18:00] the Bible says in the Book of John
[1:18:02] chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning
[1:18:03] was the word
[1:18:05] and the Word was God
[1:18:11] put on flesh and dwelt among us
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:19] because Bible students know that was
[1:18:21] Jesus Christ
[1:18:23] now the greatest gift
[1:18:26] that God has ever sent to the world
[1:18:30] okay is Christo
[1:18:35] you know the word of God
[1:18:38] when you receive it
[1:18:42] what it comes with your salvation
[1:18:45] it comes with your Victory
[1:18:48] it comes with your healing
