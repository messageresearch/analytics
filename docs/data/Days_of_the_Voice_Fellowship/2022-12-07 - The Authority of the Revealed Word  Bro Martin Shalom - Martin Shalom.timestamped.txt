[12:09] [Music]
[12:10] [Applause]
[12:15] [Music]
[12:22] [Applause]
[12:23] [Music]
[12:26] when Jesus was preaching yes
[12:31] [Music]
[12:31] [Applause]
[12:37] [Music]
[12:42] [Music]
[12:43] [Applause]
[12:44] [Music]
[12:49] [Applause]
[12:58] [Music]
[13:07] and come
[13:11] on
[13:15] come on Amen and where they came to
[13:20] Jesus
[13:25] saying that he was wealthy or whom he
[13:29] should do this
[13:32] [Music]
[13:34] this man was a good man
[13:37] he had killed the temples the Bible says
[13:44] I believe that amen so he was a good man
[13:48] he was full of good work
[13:51] but Mindy was not a Jew
[13:55] praise be to God but this man believed
[13:59] in Jesus
[14:01] so when his servant was sick
[14:04] and he heard about Jesus he knew that if
[14:08] we come into an encounter with that man
[14:17] and they sent him
[14:20] and for he loveth our nation they were
[14:23] still giving that Testament about this
[14:25] man
[14:27] and he has peeled our Senegal
[14:31] then Jesus went with them
[14:34] when you call Jesus
[14:37] Jesus will not hesitate he is to take
[14:40] their questions he will go with you
[14:43] praise the Lord amen I mean every time
[14:47] you call on him
[14:49] Jesus as long as you trust him
[14:53] as long as you believe in him he will
[14:56] respond so fast
[14:58] so Jesus followed him
[15:01] praise be to God and then Jesus went
[15:04] with him and when he was now not far
[15:07] from uh from the house the security sent
[15:12] a friend to him
[15:20] saying unto him
[15:24] Lord trouble not thyself
[15:29] remember you had sent for him
[15:32] for I'm not worry
[15:37] that thou should thou shouldest enter
[15:41] under my roof
[15:45] how many like this man tonight
[15:49] Jesus I'm not
[15:53] worrying perfect weakness
[16:02] when we think that we are able
[16:05] when we think that we are somebody
[16:08] that's when we are nothing
[16:14] but when we reach in such a point
[16:18] wherever you call for Jesus you send for
[16:22] Jesus and when it comes
[16:26] you should come under my room
[16:31] that's the only time when God will do
[16:34] something for us
[16:37] foreign
[16:45] that when Jesus had this saying
[16:48] yes
[16:50] he marveled at him
[16:54] but we know
[16:57] and turned him about
[17:00] it
[17:02] and say that other people that followed
[17:05] him
[17:07] I say unto you
[17:10] I have not found so great faith foreign
[18:16] [Applause]
[18:43] foreign
[19:20] for he told them as one that had
[19:24] Authority
[19:27] foreign
[19:34] but the truth is
[19:36] Jesus had Authority yes amen
[19:44] and not as the scribes
[19:49] praise you to God
[19:52] yes sir not as the intellectuals
[20:01] me now
[20:03] praise you to God
[20:06] amen
[20:08] praise the Lord
[20:15] praise the Lord so Jesus had Authority
[20:19] yesterday because I believe he was that
[20:22] he was not revealed
[20:24] it was the word manifested
[20:27] the word became flesh the very one which
[20:31] was spoken in the beginning
[20:34] amen the one which which created in the
[20:37] beginning
[20:38] and that's why Jesus did not played with
[20:41] the demons
[20:43] because he was the word in flesh
[20:46] he just spoke with authorities
[20:50] amen he no speak like the Pharisees
[20:57] they speak about his history
[21:00] foreign
[21:07] [Music]
[21:29] Philip he asked he asked his disciples
[21:32] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[21:36] man I am and they said some say that
[21:40] thou art John the Baptist and some Elias
[21:43] and others Jeremiahs
[21:47] or one of the prophets that is
[22:13] and it says unto them but whom say ye
[22:16] that I am
[22:22] Peter answered and said Thou Art Christ
[22:25] the son of the Living God
[22:33] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[22:36] blessed thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh
[22:40] and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[22:43] but my Father which is in heaven
[22:58] Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[23:03] peel my church and the Gates of Hell
[23:05] shall not Prevail against it
[23:08] [Music]
[23:21] amen
[23:23] and I will give us the Keys of the
[23:27] Kingdom of Heaven
[23:28] foreign
[24:04] shall be born in heaven is
[24:11] shall be loosed in heaven
[24:16] remember we are speaking about the
[24:19] authority of the revealed
[24:22] when the world is revealed to us
[24:26] when the world is revealed to you
[24:30] you have that Authority
[24:33] nothing can hinder you
[24:36] amen because you have known what you are
[24:42] praise me to God when God when it was
[24:45] revealed to Peter
[24:47] Jesus told him that blood and flesh did
[24:50] not reveal that to you yes
[24:52] but my father
[24:58] rather we are living in that time when
[25:01] the world is swallowing in darkness
[25:05] when there is
[25:10] a group of people
[25:13] God himself has revealed himself to them
[25:20] that group is
[25:28] saying that in the last few days
[25:55] [Applause]
[25:58] golden was your fortune amen Mina what
[26:02] will put the pride in her place
[26:06] Spirit and the words
[26:10] because she will recognize her position
[26:13] in the world
[26:18] then she is in Christ
[26:22] will put her in her place
[26:28] praise be to God when we recognize the
[26:32] message of our days
[26:35] when this world is revealed to us
[26:39] this word is spirit and life
[26:44] amen and this world will put us in our
[26:47] rightful place

[1:30:15] amen do you love the Lord
[1:30:18] amen we've been told
[1:30:20] a lot of things today about our
[1:30:23] Authority a traffic a traffic of officer
[1:30:27] has
[1:30:29] Authority but has no power necessarily
[1:30:32] the power of the tropical Feast I cannot
[1:30:34] stop the car
[1:30:36] if a trailer comes and if he or she
[1:30:39] tries to use her power
[1:30:40] they'll just knock her down but she uses
[1:30:44] the authority that she has
[1:30:45] so you may be weak the Bible says let
[1:30:47] the weak say
[1:30:49] let the week say
[1:30:51] so if you are weak it's not your
[1:30:54] strength remember that it's not your
[1:30:55] strength that is going to do it it is
[1:30:58] the authority that you have been given
[1:31:01] each of us has Authority as a a living
[1:31:05] daughter and son of God we've had a lot
[1:31:07] and a lot of gods have been read
[1:31:09] powerful quotes
[1:31:11] we just want to thank God for the word
[1:31:13] let us first pray and also pray for the
[1:31:15] offerings as a deacon will pass the back
[1:31:18] the offering back and then we shall sing
[1:31:21] a song or two to dismiss
[1:31:24] let us first pray
[1:31:26] precious loving Jesus we want to thank
[1:31:28] you Lord for the word which we have had
[1:31:30] our brother martin
[1:31:32] has ministered to us the mind of Christ
[1:31:36] Lord maybe this has been an
[1:31:38] encouragement to someone here who has
[1:31:40] been feeling low and feeling defeated
[1:31:44] and maybe sick in the body
[1:31:47] and weak
[1:31:49] and feeling that within them they can
[1:31:50] accomplish nothing
[1:31:52] father we've been reminded it's not
[1:31:54] about our strength
[1:31:55] it's about the authority which we have
[1:31:59] received because of who we are we are
[1:32:02] Sons and Daughters of God we are adopted
[1:32:05] into your kingdom and by virtue of that
[1:32:09] fact Lord we possess a lot of authority
[1:32:12] whereby we can claim and enforce all our
[1:32:16] god-given promises
[1:32:18] the devil has no right to keep any
[1:32:20] promise of God
[1:32:22] it never has no right to keep healing
[1:32:24] away from us the devil has no right to
[1:32:27] keep provision away from us
[1:32:29] the devil has no right to keep all our
[1:32:31] desires that we have because we have a
[1:32:34] right to claim every one of them
[1:32:36] and father maybe someone has been
[1:32:38] tormented by the devil in our midst Lord
