[1:04:43] to seek the presence of God
[1:04:47] he never went somewhere else

[1:43:16] he got hold of the microphone
[1:43:19] bless the name of the Lord I was looking
[1:43:22] for that quote I'm looking for that
[1:43:23] quote in the message in his presence
[1:43:32] okay let me first quote with this he
[1:43:34] said that when we come to church and
[1:43:36] talk and praise God and so forth but oh
[1:43:40] brother when we see him coming something
[1:43:43] different something will be different in
[1:43:46] our
[1:43:48] hearts
[1:43:53] we might think we do our religious
[1:43:55] duties between the laws
[1:43:58] by God church
[1:44:04] we might think that we keep the laws of
[1:44:07] the church
[1:44:12] but once let us get a look at him

[1:45:19] but yeah in this message the prophet
[1:45:22] talks about Charles Finney
[1:45:24] he said this man who was in the presence
[1:45:26] of God and he prayed
[1:45:29] amen it was in prayer waiting to preach
[1:45:34] in that rephire
[1:45:36] and say that they were when they were it
[1:45:39] was testing the minds
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:51] [Applause]
[1:45:56] one fell off from the platform he said
[1:45:59] that is what is being the presence
[1:46:03] when we are in the presence of God
[1:46:06] many things happening
[1:46:17] and that's what we need to walk in the
[1:46:21] presence when we're in his presence we
[1:46:25] move with a period of fire
