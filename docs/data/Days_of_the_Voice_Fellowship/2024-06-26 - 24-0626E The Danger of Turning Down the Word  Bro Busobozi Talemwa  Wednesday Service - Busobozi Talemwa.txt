amen just give the Lord a clap of praise [Music] amen can I have more sound uh this evening we are also speaking to evening light we send our greetings to the Saints there as well I'd like us to turn to our Bibles God bless each of you your word Isaiah chapter 6 we are reading from vers [Music] 8 Isaiah chter 6: 8 to 10 also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me he said go and tell these people hear ye indeed but understand not and ye and see ye indeed but perceive not make the he the heart of these people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed amen you may be seated so I'm going to speak to you today on the danger of turning down the word the danger of turning down the word so here in the book of Isaiah some of you have read here before this is the place where Isaiah heard from God in the year that King died and he said that in the year King died he saw the Lord he saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and then he goes ahead to describe how the The Throne was and um the Angels is so and so the voice Cries Out who shall I send and who will go for us but you see Isaiah could not accept he said I'm a man of unclean lips unclean tongue and um and he says my eyes have seen the king and the Lord of HS why is me and then one of the Sims flew unto him having a live call on his hand and they had taken it out of the altar with tongues and he laid it upon his mouth and and he said and he he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and th sin is PED and I heard the voice of the Lord saying then whom shall I send who will go for us so then he said here am I send me and then verse 9 he says and go and tell these people hear you indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive no make the heart of these people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes L they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and convert and be healed in other words if they could be able to hear with their ears if they could be able to see with their eyes and could be able to um their had to open up to the word of God they could convert and they could be healed many times I have said here that there is no one no matter how sinful they are can sit under the preaching of the word and not be changed no one I don't care how sinful they are or how sinful they feel if they sit under the preaching of the word there is power in the word to change a sin the word can change a liar from being a liar to being a truth a truth a truthful person the word can change a thief to a real Christian the word can change actually you know a drunker a smoker you know as an immoral person to someone that is really genuinely serving the lord but what makes some people sit under the word and they are not changed is because their ears are sealed their eyes are closed and they cannot understand with their heart so because of that they cannot be converted and they cannot be healed from death spiritual [Music] sicknesses and what causes that as we shall see it later here today turning down the word can cause someone's spiritual ears to be shut and someone's eyes to be closed we are privileged that we can be able to come sit down and hear the word it is a great great privilege but but don't do not misuse it well you have the opportunity to be in the presence of God hear everyone believe everyone open your heart to the word because if you do not do that you are you are risking to come to a place where you can never be converted you can never nevered out of your spiritual trouble and the prophet here says in the second SE and when a man turns down the gospel truth Satan Mar him where at his ear praise the name of the Lord you remember in the Old Testament when the Bible speaks of the um The Year of Jubilee that when when the sound of the trumpet went out everyone that was a slave the sound of the trumpet meant that they were free to go they were free to shout they were free to come out of their slavery they were free to go claim whatever belonged to them but if the sound if they had the sound of the trumpet and they refused to decline going out and they preferred their slave master rather than their freedom that slave would be that they said that the slave master would have to take them and put them on the door of the doorpost and or whatever and then and pin something in his ear like a tug on their ear and that would mean it was signifying that this man was going to be a slave or this woman a slave all their life why because the trumpet of the Gospel sounded trumpet of Freedom sounded but they never accepted the freedom when the trumpet of of Freedom sounds the trumpet of Jubilee and you turn down that Jubilee for slavery you never ever have that opportunity again it will be taken away from you forever now I fear there are so many people who actually go to churches but that opportunity they missed long time when Grace passed them when God visits others and yet them they never get changed I believe you to can testify there are people who can come to church year after year after year but nothing happens on their spiritual life it even be looks as if they go deeper in sin there is no change happening on the inside and of course if there is not change on the inside you cannot see change on the [Music] outside if if when you became saved you were a good liar and five years down the road you are still making a good liar it means you are not being changed if you are if you are a thief or if you an immoral person and you are not being changed years later it means something bad has happened the word actually the more you hear the word the more you sink you know the prophet spoke about the rain rainning actually the scripture would say rainning on the just and on the just and the word of God and when it rains it falls on the good and on the bad but you see the more it rains on them the more it manifests the character that they have inside of them take this example if there is a tear and there is a we the tear was not planted by the owner of the field but the wheat was planted by the owner of the field now when rain comes down rain does not disqualify the tears from the from from the from receiving the benefits of the rain the tears will receive the rain just as much as the wheat not say oh because the tears has received so much rain it means it is going to become good wheat it cannot become it remains te remains te wheat remains wheat so the outp powering of the Holy Spirit the preaching of the word actually does not there is a time a place you reach at there is something you can do that the preaching of the word and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost can literally make you worse instead of good and what am I talking about someone who hears the truth someone who hears the word someone who sees and experiences the outp powering of the Holy Ghost and turns it down and refuses it and rejects it that one their chance is gone they can never have the opportunity again their ears will be shut their eyes will be closed their hearts will never be received bam would go ahead to talk about Russia how that was an out powering there and they they rejected it and see they went into communism look at America same thing America rejected God when when God came down ATA and many other revivals even that during the the time of our Prophet did they reject did they accept the word they refused it and then the prophet says the Revival in America is over why because they rejected it why did God blind the Jews in Romans 11 it says there eyes are blinded they cannot see the truth what is the truth Jesus Christ is the truth he is the way he the life is the truth but they cannot actually be able to receive the Revelation that Jesus is the Messiah even today the Jews reject Jesus as the Messiah why because they rejected him the first time when they rejected him Their Eyes Were shut and now they cannot see even if you teach them their eyes are blinded and the Jew the Gentiles eyes is open while we still have an opportunity let us not play with what we have amen let us not turn down what we have when we hear the word let us receive with fullness of heart because time can come if you turn it down push it away that you will never have another [Music] opportunity that is the danger of turning down the word when a man turns down the gospel truth Satan Mars him he says where at his ear he defens him so he can't hear the truth no more and he's finished he stays with the group that he's with if he want hear the truth no you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the truth makes free how many believe that God Mar his God marks also his when they come God marks his by vindicating his promised word through them John 1412 and another thing if you want to put it down Mark 16 Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe amen that's what God does when you believe the truth when you accept the truth then God comes down behind you to vindicate that truth that's why Believers of this message we don't we are not sign Seekers we are not Miracle Seekers because the the Miracles are supposed to follow us the blessings are supposed to follow us whatever you need in your life amen it may be a blessing it may be a miracle it may be healing it may be you know whatever it is it is supposed to follow you you know if you truly believe the word cannot Remain the way you are year after year after year it is impossible it is impossible to be a believer of the truth and your life remain blessed and changed it is impossible if your life is the same literally it means that there's a level you need to attain of Fai it is impossible for a Believer to remain the same once there was a man called Abraham he was a Buren man his wife was called Sarai she was bur to and together for a space of time but when the word came down and the word met them and they received the word amen the bar became fruitful and that's the same principle when God comes your way and you accept the word you cannot remain the same the word of Truth gives you Freedom the word of Truth gives hope the word of Truth amen gives free if you are bound the word of the word of Truth makes you overcome sinen praise the name of the Lord First Timothy 2:3 he says for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth so God wants everyone to be saved that is why Jesus died on the cross the truth was powered out to us what is the truth Jesus is the truth what is the truth the word is the truth the message of the hour is the truth and the truth was powered out to us he wants everyone to come to the knowledge of this truth but will they come to the knowledge of the truth many have actually rejected this truth you know you talk about baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ many have rejected you talk about one God many have rejected you talk about the Rapture many have rejected many are actually preparing to go through the tribulation you talk about receiving the Holy Ghost many have no time for that and when they turn it down when you turn it down you are in a danger of losing it forever that's why as a Believer you should never reject the word portion of the word even when you don't understand always say Amen say I receive it I believe it receive it and if you don't understand it he will reveal it to you but you should believe it Believers believe that's what we are second Timothy 3:1 I show you something here about people who will actually when they turn down the truth you know they they can never receive it again and the Bible speaks of them here in this portion he says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come so men shall be lovers of their own selves cous bers proud disobedient to parents unth thanful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of them that are good traitors are you hearing what people are going to be like in the last days are you hearing Church traitors highminded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of [Music] God you know that's why you can come to to church and you find 10% of the people even on Sunday morning instead of people coming to church they would rather stay at home and watch something something or go to a certain game pleases in the end time it is prophesied that in the end time people will love Pleasures more than they love God but yet these people are not entirely Sinners or titled or called Sinners they don't even call themselves unbelievers we are talking about Christians here soal we talking about Believers because the B says in verse five having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof now what is the the power of the Gospel the power of the of the Gospel is is the faith of it is the Holy Spirit and they deny it but they have a form of Godly but they deny the truth are you hearing me they will hear the the the preaching and they they will come to church they will say they Christians but they will deny the truth when the truth is being preached they will not open their hearts to receive their hearts are hard like a rock by the time you preach to them they have made up their mind on what they want to believe and they cannot open their hearts to be corrected the Bible says we have those people in the end time they will not say we are nonbelievers they will say we are believers but they will deny the truth and the Bible says from such turn away they will say we are believers but when you tell them a woman is not supposed to dress a thousand they say in our church we don't believe that what is it they don't have the love of the truth but they have Jesus on their mouth when you tell them immorality is wrong you will find men refusing to accept they will say they will ask you a question who can live in this world without being immoral you know they they don't have they cannot retain God in their knowledge they cannot open their hearts to the truth let me tell you you are blessed today if you can hear the word and receive the word and accept correction of the truth amen you come here because you are bad and you want to be good you come here because you a sinner and you want to be saved we come to God because we realize we need a change from the inside but the Bible says these people these men they turn they turn down the truth they deny the power of the word amen and so the Bible says from such we should turn away and that's why we are gathering here that's why we left our big monasteries that's why we left our big Cathedrals and we came together in a small place and the Bible says you are blessed you little FL you are blessed they can't understand why do you Fellowship in small small places why don't you all come in our big cathal amen because they deny the power of the word because they deny the power of God therefore he says from such we should turn away from them and we turned away for for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive City women Laden with sins LED away with diverse lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth praise the name of the Lord they ever learn Bible studies after Bible studies they have their scripture unions they have their theological seminaries you know they they know how to describe Greek and Hebrew and everything some of these people you you take them into the simple teaching of the word then they will take you to Greek then they take you to Hebrew and then they'll try to show you that they understand the scriptures more than they and then some of them in in in evangelism they've asked us how much how much have you are you educated how much theology do you know do you have a masters do you have do you have a doctorate do you have a PhD in theology if you said no then they would say you have nothing to tell it's only in this message of the hour where we have preachers who are preaching because they have an experience with God hallelu to there they amen even when they have not they don't have theology they are pending to go they waiting to go and they're waiting for the money maybe they're waiting for an opportunity but to them qualification of a Preacher is theology but for us we are like Paul we are like Peter these men they stood and say the word you speak unto you and not from man is wisdom it's not what man teaches amen it comes from the anointing of am the Holy Ghost oh praise the name of the Lord amen the true bride of Christ does not learn from theology amen she learns from what she learns from prophecy amen he says behold I would send you Elijah the prophet when Elijah came down with th say the Lord and every child of God their heart hungers their heart thir Amen to hear thus sayth the Lord amen we are we want to eat from inspiration we want to eat fresh kill amen from the supernatural this message is not a mind of a man not a thought of a man it is a fresh kill Hallelujah and we are EOS we are you Eagles CH we are EOS amen and eego eats fresh meat an eego cannot eat rotten meat we are EOS and the message we have today is the anti message is the fresh kill and we have received it and where that meat is amen where the fresh kill is that's where the Eagles are gathered that's why you can't stay at home on day that's why you can't stay at home on Sunday whenever there is a fellowship you run to church why that because you want to be entertained not because you're looking for pleasure but because you are looking for that fresh kill amen because you are an eag we are eag God is Pro is an ego amen God is an ego and he comes down and and breaks the Word of Life to us we begin enjoying we enjoying the fresh K hallelujah amen amen but these people they are ever learning in their theology they know the book this the book that they but they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth my God they can't come to the knowledge of the truth they learn until they called PhD in theology in God soal they learn God until they get a PhD in God but they don't know baptism is in the name of our Lord Jesus they learn but they can't understand that women are not supposed to be on the poit they ever learning but they never able to come to the knowledge of the truth thank God for the message because when we hear the message we come to the truth amen we don't turn it down we accept it whole we receive it with all our hearts oh thank God for this precious message of the hour now as J and jamb with Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further they shall proceed no further for their F shall be manifest unto all men as they as also was cannot proceed no further than their Hallelujah the Bible says their mind are corrupt they reprobate concerning the faith the Bible says they are like Janice and jamb how were they when Moses came down Moses was was having the mind of Christ Moses was having th of was having the truth in his hands and when he came down there came Janice there came and they threw down their their roads and their roads became also and the mouth of of Moses's the snake of Moses open his mouth and swallow the the snakes that came out of J and jamb but there is no scripture that says men repented there is no scripture that shows these men finally saw the truth they are reprobate concerning the truth they rejected Moses and by rejecting Moses amen their F was made manifest and they proceeded no father amen they could only stop where they were at stop with their fly let me tell you church we have a message that is Vindicated by God God came downen and showed himself he was with William Brother William bram's message is not against saying s he is not you know guessing that guessing this the message of William Bram was Vindicated by God th say the Lord amen it is Vindicated by the Bible he said if I preach anything and it is not in the Bible he said leave it alone that is a prophet of God because a true Prophet will not say anything that is against the prophets that came before him a true Prophet is not like Muhammad because Muhammad came 600 years later but things he teaches are not here therefore we don't follow that word we follow our Prophet who has that say the Worden this message is not some new teaching this message is not a new ideology this message is the original Faith the origal truth in which the men of old walked in but others like J and jamb they with Moses even today we have men who are withstanding this message but what happened to them they could proceed no further oh the word is not always preached to be believed sometimes it is for a witness let us keep preaching the word amen if they believe you preach if they refuse You Preach if they accept you preach they turn it down your pre that's why amen if we are called by God I Don't Preach because you are accepting I Don't Preach because you are few or because you are many I preach because I'm called to preach amen why because this word must be preached a witness amen whereby if you reject it Amen on that day The Voice this voice you are hearing tonight will be played back again in your ears amen don't think the word of God dies the voice of the word does not die it continues on ringing it continues on ringing amen if you believe you will meet it the other side but if you refuse it you will meet it the other side so a judgment if I am you brother sister let us believe the word when we hear it every part of the world because every part of the world is truth every part of the world to be believed every part of the word is to be eaten is to be when he gave the open book he said Take and Eat take and eat it will be in your mouth sweet as H it will be in your belly bitter what are we doing we are taking the word the open Word and we are eating it not some of it all of the world Believers believe all of the world even if your that word has not yet manifested in you you believe it and you will become the word amen amen the danger of turning down the word is that you will never get another opportunity and we find here I'll show you an example Matthew 5:20 for I say unto you that accept your righteousness you message Believers except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees shall in no case enter into the kingdom of now the Pharisees had to fulfill the works of the Lord for example thou shal not kill now they had to fulfill the works but for us our righteousness has to go beyond the work now our righteousness is Christ requires us to have his righteousness in our hearts by faith in his word that is righte Hallelujah that is the only righteousness that exceeds the law amen glory to God hallelujah that is the only thing that exists the law because said I did not come to take away the law he came to fulfill the requirement of the law the requirement of the law was that they may be holy even as God is Holy but the Lord demanded you to do certain things certain way according to your ability and the phes did those things to the best of their knowledge but they failed many times they became Hypocrites in the process and Christ came down and proved it to them that they were Hypocrites he asked them if your camel falls into the ditch on Sabbath day don't you remove it and they all looked at one another because they all knew they did it they were Hypocrites amen because within our works our abilities we cannot be perfect and God knows that and that's why he say for us to be able to go to heaven our righteousness must exceed the righteous of the Lord amen what is it it is Christ amen requiring us to have his righteousness where in our hearts by Fai by belief of the truth the Bible says you Sanctified by belief of the truth amen by faith in the word in the truth thank God for the message we have something to believe when you believe the message you are Sanctified you become holy you are made holy and you receive his righteous hallah glory to God Amen this go well over and Beyond just the good works if you turn down that word in your heart your Works will be evil it will always be evil listen if you accept the word your Works will be holy but if you turn down the work your Works will always be evil so now when Christ came he gave us the insurance faith by Grace is an insurance to go into heaven we now know we cannot be denied because we have received it by faith through Grace it is the gift of God am and if we have it in our heart then we will not do evil so we don't need the law we are above the law we above the because we we are fulfilling his will we are Ho by default God 1 John 3:2 nor does who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and where why did he kill him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous why because Abel was predestinated he was a seed of God from before the foundation of the world his works could not be evil because in his heart was the law of God bound are you hearing me who told him that give a lamb who told him shed blood was in his heart it was a revelation faith is a revelation of the will of God and this boy had how did he get it he had it by default it was in him the Bible says they that are born of God canot see why because the seed of God remains in them the seed of God was in AB was a SE of God because of that could not see AB had Fai meaning AB had a revelation his Papa and Mama did not eat apples it was a revelation he had a revelation it had something to do with the blood it was a revelation the Bride of Jesus Christ we have a revelation of who we are we have a revelation we are not here to be B Church do we are not here to join our denomination we are not here to have our Ed somewhere we are here Amen to practice and manifest The Life of Christ in us that at the end of the day we will be carried away to the Rapture that is why we are here it is by Revelation Hallelujah Matthew 13: 10 and the disciples came and said unto him to Jesus why speakest thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whoever has to him shall be given do you have something amen God will add more and he shall have more abundance if you have faith God is going to increase if you have faith God is going to give you what you need you see because you have he will my but whoever has not from him shall be taken away even that he has therefore speak I to them in Parables because they see they see not I want you to see something here and hearing they hear not neither do they understand you remember God told Isaiah in the scripture we read first whom shall I send and the man said here I send me Lord and he said speak unto these people they have eyes but they see not they have ears but they hear not why why now we know why now we know why in Matthew because the Bible is saying here verse 14 and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of [Music] Isaiah in who in the Pharisees and the SES the people who were Jews but what happened with when the Messiah came they saw him they never accepted him rejected him and when they rejected him the Bible says that prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled with them which Say by hearing he shall hear by hearing he shall hear and shall not understand and seeing he shall see and shall not perceive for these people's hearts is wased gross and their ears a of hearing and their eyes they have closed L at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them who Jesus Isaiah was speaking of Jesus when Jesus came Oh Glory to God when Jesus came and he started speaking to the phes and he never spoke to them in words they can understand he spoke to them in Parables and when he finished The Parables he would leave them he would again come another Parable and then he would leave them and one time one disciple asked but why do you speak in Parable today why do you speaking Parables and Jesus answered because they have eyes they can't see they have ears they can't hear it is them it is them it should be fulfilled what is prophesied why do I waste my time to explain what they can't understand but he looked to the disciples and he said back back blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear oh for I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and I've have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them who was hearing the disciples the disciples Jesus knew they had ears to hear they had eyes to hear so he spent time interpreting what the pares meant Jesus won't spend time on someone he knows their D of [Music] hearing they can't see the D of hearing doesn't was his time he doesn't have his precious time but we see in our generation once again once again you remember Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever what he did then he does today today once again he has appeared he has appeared through Elijah the prophet he never wasted time with the Pentecostal babies never even when he went among their churches he preached to them ABCs and when he came to the Tabernacle where the Believers were he preached the Deep Mysteries he went into the seal Hallelujah he went to the serpent SE because God was explaining The Parables of the Bible to you the bride and I want to tell you today blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they he amen glory hallelujah amen we see in John 1: 10 he was in the world and the Word was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own the Jews and he own received him but as many oh I can even say today he was in the world to the world the world was made by him but the world knew him until today they don't know that Jesus was God the world thinks he is the third person of the Trinity they are lost they don't know they are lost they are blind they have eyes but they can it is right in here he is called emuel which means God is with us not the second person not the third person not the first person but God himself they read it they sing it but they have eyes but they can't see after reading and hearing they still call him the second person the they begin singing Jehovah is your name and then they say no for him is just the son they can't understand but you can you can understand the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new is a revelation he was in the world they knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not he came unto his denominations his churches they said they are Jesus's churches he came into his churches they rejected him theyed him not but as many has received him the Believers they are whever they are as many has received him them gave he power to become the sons of God am I have an announcement to make you are the sons of God you are the sons of God we are the sons of God shout it out I am the Son of God even to them that believe on his name hallelujah what is his name his name is the Jesus Christ we are the people that believe on his name which we are not born of blood no of the will of the flesh no of the will of man no of the will of any Church of the will of the not of the will of denomination but the will of God hallelujah the Pharisees rejected the word of Christ their ears were sin blocked from hearing the truth permanently second Timothy 4 he says I charge thee there before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead that is appearing in his kingdom preach the word instant in season out of season reprove rebuke EX with all long suffering and doctr for the time will come when they will not endure s doctr but after their own L shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned to fa but what thou in all things andure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of th Ministry we are going to evangelize this message there is nothing the devil can do to stop us let me tell you the devil tried the devil will try but he cannot stop this briide this briide is Unstoppable they're trying to make us a denomination they even trying to say we should not preach we should only put the TS of our Prophet that is a wrong Spirit no one is going to stop us no one is going to stop this bride we are going to preach it by leaving it we are also going to preach it by quoting it we also going to preach it by inspiration we are going to preach this message regardless the cannot stop this bride Hallelujah we know who we are we are not guessing at this we are not trying we are here because we have a proven message my my time is up but allow me to read a portion here from thean church age when the church allowed herself to move away from the original like Adam and Eve dead set in there is no strength in her she be has become a monstrosity horrific me that the church moved toward form and ceremony and toward priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the Holy Ghost and his word it is not a group of ministers that sanction of preacher listen it is not a group of ministers that start a church it is not a church or a denomination that sends out a preacher what does it is called by the power of the Holy Ghost that is Apostolic he sends that a preacher and a church is started and that church is not led by a denomination is not led by a man that church is led by two things the Holy Spirit and the word hallelujah that very moment death sits and entered and she started to get sick and as she got sick she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument you find ministering I am this don't do this the trth oh we are delivered from that the message of the hour has delivered us from that she could produce nothing in the spirit for our hopes were built on program and not on faith in his word they sold program so they ripped program they sold perversion so they reaped perverted children you tamper with God and you reap exactly what you injected man ought to learn from that that from nature he has tampered with nature he has injected his own ideas into nature and rearranged the molecules Etc and now he is reaping a worldwind just look how they have braed the chicken it is so bread that it is a laying machine that lays itself out is not good for food and it's soft and poor eating they inject substances into the meat and we eat the meat we eat and because of that the human body is changing so that women are getting narrower in the hips [Music] and broader of shoulder and men are getting just the opposite now if you fool with nature and get a mon and backfire what will happen if you change the truth into a lie the answer is you will breed Antichrist Godless system of religion that is so perverted it will not look like or produce what the original did the only answer that God has for a situation like that is the L of fire but I want to say thank God we don't have to go there because we believe the word we have not turned down the word we how many agree with the word we believe the word when we hear the word we say amenu the danger of turning the word turning down the word is you will be blinded forever your ears will be blocked forever and the answer is the lake of fire god Mercy the danger
