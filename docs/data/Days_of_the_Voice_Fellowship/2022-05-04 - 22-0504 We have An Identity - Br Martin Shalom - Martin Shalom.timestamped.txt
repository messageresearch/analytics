[1:32:12] moment
[1:32:15] i just want to greet you all in the
[1:32:17] precious name of jesus christ
[1:32:22] i did not expect that i would make it to
[1:32:24] church today no
[1:32:52] but also they
[1:32:54] i was we had four days of meetings
[1:32:59] and i thought initially that i had a
[1:33:01] backup plan
[1:33:05] i thought that brother
[1:33:07] elder brother charles of mata would be
[1:33:09] helping me
[1:33:13] as a pastor from sorority
[1:33:16] but we we had our first service in
[1:33:18] morocco
[1:33:21] and the reception was really nice
[1:33:23] abandoned
[1:33:25] and so after the preaching we had agreed
[1:33:27] with the past that you will be taking
[1:33:29] we will be alternating the services
[1:33:31] either i take morning it takes afternoon
[1:33:33] i check afternoon next morning
[1:34:05] so
[1:34:06] for uh
[1:34:07] meetings
[1:34:13] sometimes
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:28] as i will show you on sunday i will give
[1:34:30] you a full report on something
[1:34:34] every day uh
[1:34:35] at one time we had a
[1:34:37] a little
[1:34:39] more than 500 people gathered in the
[1:34:40] same place world war ii
[1:35:23] and we gave out messages
[1:35:26] the brothers they took with me helped me
[1:35:27] to distribute their books
[1:35:32] and to drive sometimes i did most of the
[1:35:34] driving because of the bad roads never
[1:35:36] said even
[1:35:39] so but the lord was good in all the name
[1:35:42] of your name come here so you will get
[1:35:44] the full report on the videos for the
[1:35:46] first time i think i will prepare a
[1:35:48] video
[1:35:49] uh a presentation to show you to show
[1:35:51] the whole channel
[1:35:54] will be fun and you know
[1:36:06] you had a wonderful time here on friday
[1:36:23] so the holy spirit is the same my mom
[1:36:25] took over he was moving in karamoja
[1:36:30] so myself uh you need to pray for me to
[1:36:32] get even strength to preach
[1:36:37] i was telling one brother that some
[1:36:39] ministers
[1:36:40] in other countries they take a leave for
[1:36:42] some
[1:36:43] several days or weeks
[1:37:05] one pastor was to do that i think many
[1:37:07] many would judge me and say the pastor
[1:37:09] is becoming cannon
[1:37:16] but i think one of these days i'll do it
[1:37:18] i hope not no one will say that
[1:37:25] because you know from ethiopia ethiopia
[1:37:29] you know kenya kenya
[1:37:31] ministry here
[1:37:42] he said you don't realize that you are
[1:37:44] overworking yourself until you get above
[1:37:46] 50. again
[1:38:06] so you need to pray for me
[1:38:09] i i hope that you people love me and
[1:38:12] pray for me
[1:38:17] um
[1:38:18] before we we give our offerings
