[1:06:01] i'm going to speak about today for now
[1:06:03] to sundays actually three services

[1:06:40] the house of god
[1:06:44] the true
[1:06:59] or hearing how great a preacher is
[1:07:04] but it's about meeting the lord jesus
[1:07:09] and jesus is always made through his
[1:07:11] word
[1:07:40] little to be able to meet him tomorrow

[1:10:42] of god above everybody knows
[1:10:44] financial control because of the way we
[1:10:46] come in the world
[1:10:50] we come in the world in a fallen nature
[1:10:52] and situating
[1:10:55] by past our true nature
[1:11:00] what is our true nature or we don't
[1:11:02] never forget our true nature is the
[1:11:04] nature of god but we don't never follow
[1:11:06] truth
[1:11:07] our true nature is a nature which cannot
[1:11:09] die
[1:11:10] by foreign
[1:11:38] we are not born

[1:23:28] this way
[1:23:30] it was created
[1:24:56] it could
[1:25:38] that even

[1:26:44] himself
[1:26:47] he was cutting the dna in the messiah
[1:26:55] of his father
[1:26:57] and now cathy adam was like god
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:15] so now the bible says i believe so god
[1:27:18] created the man in his own image
[1:27:26] in the image of god created him male and
[1:27:28] female
[1:27:44] he created them by the spoken word

[1:28:29] oh no
[1:28:32] he was not having a body of flesh
[1:28:36] and he told him to call and multiply
[1:28:40] again there
[1:29:21] immediately
[1:29:36] pain
[1:29:38] without suffering
[1:29:39] and then another time
[1:29:42] and they would feel their back to zen
[1:29:44] sick that was the perfect will of god
[1:29:50] and all of them would be in the image of
[1:29:52] god
[1:29:54] furniture those sons of adam would be in
[1:29:56] the image
[1:29:58] something happened
[1:30:02] came oh no
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] that god has not told you
[1:30:21] that you can have actual children
[1:30:25] but when did the suffering come now
[1:30:29] the serpent came
[1:30:32] for genesis
[1:30:47] the ground oh yeah
[1:30:50] the body

[1:30:56] this is not the image of god
[1:31:00] tell your name
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:43] why mobility this body
[1:31:45] and when it was formed
[1:31:48] then god wow
[1:31:50] you know he knew that this is just
[1:31:51] nothing
[1:31:53] but then what did he do
[1:31:55] he breathed
[1:32:21] those of you who have ever bought
[1:32:23] clothes or you pass around you see
[1:32:38] he was like
[1:32:52] and he
[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:33:07] she know charity food this body was dead
[1:33:10] without the breath of god
[1:33:13] without the spirit of god
[1:33:15] because remember
[1:33:17] man was created
[1:33:19] by the breath of god
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:34:02] me
[1:34:12] hallelujah amen and some man was formed
[1:34:40] and then at that moment
[1:34:43] when man became a living soulmate where
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:36:18] [Applause]
[1:36:36] in order
[1:36:49] by the way this man and
[1:37:15] it is true
[1:37:17] the devil knew something they did not
[1:37:19] know
[1:37:22] he was a spiritual being
[1:37:25] and when he went to the woman
[1:37:32] and what is that schedule but the
[1:37:34] manhattan says
[1:37:36] that the seed of the serpent is satan
[1:37:39] could mingle with that with that with a
[1:37:42] without of the woman yes
[1:37:46] to bring forth a child never said oh no
[1:37:51] you're very quiet on me this morning
[1:37:57] and i know this subject
[1:37:59] some of you may be new but those of you
[1:38:01] who know it and you understand it if you
[1:38:03] hear something you believe say amen
[1:38:10] and this seed and seekers
[1:38:13] could mingle yeah yes
[1:38:16] with the human race
[1:38:20] and it continues
[1:38:25] and that is exactly what happened
[1:39:38] the bible
[1:39:52] the serpent would now walk on its belly
[1:39:59] what does it mean
[1:40:00] it wasn't working
[1:40:06] it was not a snake
[1:40:10] it was not a reptile the child
[1:40:13] it was a beast
[1:40:16] like you see me never understand you see
[1:40:19] yourself never worry about having two
[1:40:21] legs
[1:40:25] that is how the serpent was oh gosh
[1:40:29] and it was eating apples from the
[1:40:32] from the garden
[1:41:16] because it was
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:31] did he go get out what the bible says
[1:41:38] did god say
[1:41:40] to your god you shall not eat of every
[1:41:42] tree foreign
[1:42:13] guru after he was um thrown out from
[1:42:16] heaven
[1:42:18] he came down to the earth
[1:42:21] and then how he incarnated into the
[1:42:24] species
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:47] to be able to mix up with the human race
[1:42:52] when saturn was thrown away from the
[1:42:55] kingdom of god
[1:42:59] he thought he would come and destabilize
[1:43:01] the kingdom of man
[1:43:05] because
[1:43:07] the kingdom of man
[1:43:22] let me go to
[1:44:31] but that was not god's perfection
[1:44:58] and once you accept it whatever your kid
[1:44:59] is she received seed enough for an
[1:45:01] instigator and when she received the
[1:45:03] scene
[1:45:04] she became pregnant
[1:45:06] and then the bible says
[1:45:08] she went down to her husband now then
[1:45:10] they were bowed with her
[1:45:12] navidad and they did it
[1:45:42] foreign
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:47:21] satan
[1:47:23] to kill abel
[1:47:26] that seed line of god
[1:47:34] he did not
[1:47:45] foreign
[1:48:02] adam
[1:48:06] was not included
[1:48:09] why why
[1:48:11] his father was not
[1:48:12] attacked
[1:48:15] online
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:57] his blood was not silent
[1:49:17] hallelujah amen and then what did god do
[1:49:21] he gave eve yawakawa through adam
[1:49:25] adam another seed
[1:49:54] of the
[1:50:09] catch him but cain was not
[1:50:12] really that's why seth jovan says the
[1:50:16] bible includes him as the first son of
[1:50:18] adam bible and he can't it says
[1:50:22] when
[1:50:50] in the ground
[1:51:17] adam was in the image of god yeah much
[1:51:20] fun
[1:51:22] but when adam sinned
[1:51:30] and he came down from the image he was
[1:52:01] finding
[1:52:03] god bless you
[1:52:06] all born in that foreign image of god
[1:52:08] furniture
[1:52:11] because the bible says that saith
[1:52:12] biblica
[1:52:13] was in the image of god
[1:52:16] that saith was in the image of god says
[1:52:18] furniture
[1:52:19] seth was in the image of adam rather
[1:52:22] bible gambler says the animated
[1:52:24] financial adam but adam's image robert
[1:52:27] financial adam was a following image
[1:52:39] years later down the road now i say
[1:52:42] shouldn't
[1:53:09] our original path was what was not
[1:53:11] correct
[1:53:16] us into a ton of troubles
[1:53:20] we are born with all sorts of mixed
[1:53:22] feelings
[1:53:53] we are born
[1:53:55] with the form of god
[1:53:58] furniture
[1:54:03] because we are born in a foreign
[1:54:48] [Music]
[1:54:50] why because the seed of god remains in
[1:54:53] them
[1:54:56] but yet
[1:54:58] we were born sinners
[1:55:01] but why does the bible
[1:55:03] by say
[1:55:03] gamblers
[1:55:11] as the bible says
[1:55:13] because
[1:55:14] when we hear the word of god
[1:55:40] amen amen and that's what it means that
[1:55:43] you cannot sin
[1:56:53] hallelujah amen
[1:56:55] and the serpent seed and single yeah you
[1:56:58] can never accept the word
[1:57:01] god came down one day
[1:57:04] and he spoke to cain
[1:57:06] imagine
