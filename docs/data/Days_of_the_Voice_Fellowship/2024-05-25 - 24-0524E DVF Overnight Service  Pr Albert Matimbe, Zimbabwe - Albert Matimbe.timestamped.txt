[19:31] Al all the way from
[19:35] Zimbabwe Allelujah
[19:39] amen specifically from a place called
[19:43] concession concession uh I've been
[19:49] there I
[19:51] think he was the first
[19:55] person to invite me uh
[19:59] out of East
[20:04] Africa uh he I don't know how he got to
[20:07] know me but I think he saw my
[20:11] website which I had put up at that
[20:14] time I was a very young
[20:18] boy it's um I'm trying to see how many
[20:22] years ago it
[20:25] was let me try to do some math here
[20:30] uh okay so that
[20:33] was 13 years
[20:36] ago and uh he I was very young at the
[20:41] time uh but somehow he invited
[20:44] me and we had I remember it was they
[20:48] were holding a convention
[20:53] there I think I don't remember the
[20:55] number of people maybe close to 600
[21:03] were attending that youth youth youth
[21:06] camp and so I was the youngest of the
[21:11] preachers and I think I was 19 or 20
[21:15] around that
[21:18] time and um if you remember brother how
[21:21] many remember brother K
[21:24] sing the South African brother he came
[21:28] here
[21:29] brother kin sing kin oh sing yes yes so
[21:34] brother kin was one of the speakers at
[21:36] that youth
[21:39] comp and that's where we
[21:41] met so Pastor mtim had invited
[21:45] him invited me and that's why
[21:48] met so uh it was a very a very wonderful
[21:54] time that we had at the
[21:56] time I I had planned to
[21:59] I was at campus at University at the
[22:01] time and I had planned
[22:03] [Music]
[22:06] to just go away for about a week or
[22:11] two and but I ended up when I preached
[22:15] on that youth
[22:19] conference uh they
[22:21] uh there were many
[22:24] pastors and so we got many invitations
[22:26] out from that
[22:29] and God gave us more more open doors
[22:34] in so I went planning to spend there a
[22:39] week but I ended up spending there more
[22:41] than one
[22:44] month and it was a very lifechanging
[22:47] time for
[22:50] us we went to many
[22:52] places I remember that that is when we
[22:55] also ministered for the late Pastor
[22:57] Chessa
[23:02] took me
[23:04] toess and then I had a conference with
[23:08] Pastor Chessa a
[23:11] talk I met him for the first time
[23:14] there and uh afterwards when we
[23:18] talked he liked me very much and then he
[23:21] said I'd like you to come on
[23:24] Wednesday and we are going to have a
[23:27] youth meeting
[23:29] I thought we are going to have maybe 100
[23:33] or 200 young
[23:36] people so when I moved from the
[23:40] office very large
[23:42] building so when I moved from the back
[23:44] side of the
[23:45] office and came in the auditorium
[23:49] the I almost fell
[23:53] down almost 3,000
[23:56] people it was my first time
[23:59] time so many uh
[24:03] Believers parked in one
[24:05] place at the same time and not only that
[24:10] that I was supposed to preach to
[24:12] them I lost strength in my
[24:16] knees and I was like H the pastor told
[24:19] me to the
[24:20] youth he should have told me is a
[24:24] service of
[24:26] everyone so I was uh so disappointed in
[24:30] myself that I thought I was not ready
[24:32] for speaking to these
[24:35] people but by God's
[24:38] grace uh I remember I sang a song I
[24:40] still remember that brother M very well
[24:44] I theong um uh I love him I love him
[24:50] because he first loved
[24:51] me and then God gave me Grace felt the
[24:56] anointing of God upon me
[24:59] and I started preaching I preached on
[25:02] desperation it was a wonderful
[25:04] moment together with Pastor matim would
[25:07] then go on to move to other rural areas
[25:09] of
[25:11] zimb remember we went to a place called
[25:15] guu very
[25:18] cold um you know you could feel the
[25:20] coldness through your
[25:22] bones that it was a very rural
[25:25] area we didn't even have a car
[25:29] so we went by public
[25:31] means and when we were coming when we
[25:34] came out of the of the car go to where
[25:36] we were
[25:38] going it was many
[25:41] kilometers I don't remember how many but
[25:43] it was many
[25:45] kilometers and we I I we had blankets
[25:48] and our bags
[25:50] and so I they gave me mine I carried a
[25:54] very huge
[25:55] blanket and put on the head and we began
[25:59] walking I still have that
[26:01] picture and I I was walking and walking
[26:05] he was older than I but I was getting
[26:09] tired and I was wondering that this man
[26:11] is not getting
[26:13] tired he very strong and he really
[26:16] challenged me that I felt I have not
[26:19] done anything for the
[26:21] Lord and I can go on and on relating
[26:24] what what happened on that tree
[26:28] I remember when I was going there on
[26:30] that same trip in
[26:33] Tanzania that is where I also had a few
[26:35] experiences which I've shared with many
[26:37] of
[26:39] you uh I will not go in the details
[26:43] again but several so I mean God used
[26:46] Pastor
[26:48] mtim in the early years of our life and
[26:52] Min I thought that that
[26:55] trip that I had in Zimbabwe at that time
[27:00] was a very good time for for
[27:03] us as we were entering into
[27:06] Ministry Pastor matim is a pastor there
[27:10] in
[27:12] concession but also he a
[27:15] missionary many countries around
[27:18] Africa and uh I just trust whatever he
[27:21] will have to
[27:23] say
[27:25] sing We just have a few moments with him
[27:30] um he will uh shortly after he
[27:34] preaches he's going to go on a bus or on
[27:38] a taxi to uh what's the name of the
[27:41] place
[27:44] to where he will be in the morning
[27:48] ministering for
[27:52] pastorate so you can see he's a very
[27:54] committed
[27:56] man so we should
[27:58] value the time that we have with
[28:01] him and to those of you that have been
[28:03] able to come thank you for
[28:05] coming you've not come in
[28:08] vain Jesus has a table
[28:11] SP amen and
[28:14] uh his sons he has two
[28:18] sons very close friend of
[28:21] mine they're currently in the UK but we
[28:23] keep in touch
[28:26] each so we just pray just commit
[28:29] ourselves the Holy Spirit asking that
[28:32] the Lord will minister to
[28:34] us is that a prayer that you
[28:36] have amen so he's ministered for many
[28:41] years very simple
[28:43] man but a very great man in the in the
[28:46] things of God pray that you just commit
[28:49] yourself to the Lord and that he will

[34:35] experiences where there were some
[34:37] prophetic
[34:39] utterances from within the
[34:43] churches in
[34:45] 1995 when I was in
[34:48] Mala uh there was some some
[34:53] utterances uh with some ministers there
[34:58] they told me uh the Lord is saying you
[35:01] are going to have a
[35:04] Ministry I will share with you on that
[35:07] part I got a dream and in that dream I
[35:11] was in the center of
[35:13] har and it was a well that was so
[35:19] deep and I was told by The
[35:22] Voice you got to go
[35:25] down and build the wall of that
[35:29] well not crumble
[35:32] in so I said no I can't do that I have
[35:37] no
[35:38] experience my father is the one who had
[35:42] experienced when I was
[35:45] resisting there came from
[35:47] Heaven
[35:48] a tied onto a
[35:51] Rob from heaven and then I found myself
[35:56] I was I was thrown into that
[35:59] and the te was rolled
[36:01] the
[36:04] down of the
[36:06] world and I was
[36:08] resisting pushing the
[36:10] Wolves why are you sending me
[36:14] down I told you
[36:17] already but I couldn't
[36:21] overcome the the Rob went
[36:24] down when the te reached the bottom
[36:29] I saw a
[36:31] rock underneath I felt there was a rock
[36:34] underneath the
[36:37] bucket that rock
[36:39] surface pushed
[36:42] that me
[36:44] up to the level ground or the ground
[36:50] level that when I was in that
[36:53] well I could see people outside
[36:58] then when that happened I had some
[37:02] confidence I can build those
[37:05] walls were brothers I
[37:07] saw gathered
[37:09] around and they were giving me ground
[37:13] nuts when I was in
[37:16] that building that and then the
[37:19] interpretation was you have got a work
[37:22] to
[37:23] do you shouldn't
[37:25] resist praise God
[37:28] that was in
[37:31] 1995 in
[37:34] 2006 I went to uh
[37:38] 2006 I went to AA Nigeria after
[37:43] preaching
[37:45] there some a sister came with this a
[37:48] pastor and he said uh when you were
[37:54] preaching the voice from the Lord said
[37:58] I will send you to many
[38:01] nations preaching my gospel you have not
[38:05] done any work
[38:06] yet that was
[38:09] 2006 I come back to 2001 my first
[38:13] experience inala
[38:16] Uganda just after ministering
[38:20] conven there was some prophetic
[38:22] utterances the
[38:24] conation yes and 2002
[38:30] when brother was
[38:34] alive when I was about to finish
[38:38] preaching he started
[38:40] prophesying speaking Tong he said it's
[38:43] not brother M who
[38:46] speaking it's I the Lord who has
[38:50] spoken and when we were there we went on
[38:54] the floor down on our knees
[38:58] in the convention we were praying
[39:02] pastor Pastor Bas was
[39:05] there Pastor
[39:08] Michael there was also Pastor Chris
[39:12] from I'm mentioning those names for
[39:16] Witnesses this is what
[39:19] transpired in the pilgrim or PR walk in
[39:23] my journey as a minister of the Gospel
[39:27] praise God I'm also
[39:30] reminded when we were in
[39:32] Moos the Lord said some
[39:37] prophetic my children don't worry even
[39:41] though you are in this
[39:43] Zone which is politically
[39:47] volatile I am with you in
[39:51] 2013 when we were in
[39:55] groombridge there was some prophet
[39:59] don't worry my children you are going to
[40:01] have a successful
[40:04] convention and you shall have a
[40:07] convention we had a
[40:10] successful I take you to
[40:14] 2016 when I was
[40:19] in I was SE
[40:22] there and I I was being I'd be informed
[40:26] that I would take a service
[40:31] for me I was wondering what is it that I

[40:36] say before many
[40:38] people people had come from
[40:40] America others from Australia
[40:44] Philippines nor itself and other
[40:49] countries I look it

[40:58] to you know English is a second language
[41:01] to
[41:02] us that's not my
[41:05] mother it's a bored language so
[41:08] sometimes you you wonder what grammar
[41:12] would you put
[41:15] for what expressions of
[41:19] prophets you can put
[41:22] across that people can understand
[41:25] you in that
[41:29] dilemma one man in the
[41:32] congregation started speaking in
[41:36] t those of you who know brother
[41:39] strowman brother strowman was in one
[41:42] corner he started to
[41:45] interpret he said my son my son don't
[41:48] worry about what you are going
[41:50] to I've put a thought in
[41:53] you and that thought preach
[41:59] don't get puffed up just humble yourself

[42:25] podium the Lord did
[42:29] prom God

[56:35] second it is high above all other
[56:41] ReliOn don't be ashamed to be identified
[56:44] with Christian
[56:48] faith because the Lord and Savior Jesus
[56:51] Christ rose from the
[56:54] dead yes sir
[56:57] this is the only
[56:59] religion that is managed to put people
[57:04] together which break breaks geographical
[57:11] boundaries real
[57:13] Christianity knows no
[57:16] politics real
[57:18] Christianity knows no racial
[57:22] discrimination real real Christian
[57:27] denominationalism not churchism
[57:35] real there is no geographical
[57:39] boundary there's no separation of
[57:43] Brotherhood there's no doal
[57:47] differences no wonder why
[57:50] Messenger to the ludan
[57:54] church we have no other text
[57:57] book but the
[57:59] Bible we know
[58:02] other
[58:04] other Jesus Christ he said we are change
[58:08] without
[58:09] love but love no
[58:13] boundary the world is my
[58:17] Parish I'm saying tonight real
[58:21] Christianity there's no
[58:24] differences discrimination
[58:28] people are closely bonded to one
[58:32] another in
[58:35] 2008 I made a trip to
[58:38] Israel and I went to find out whether
[58:41] this preachers he preached the
[58:44] truth they he from the death so I had to
[58:49] go there to prove I tell you Brothers
[58:53] his
[58:54] faith been graphically proven to
[59:00] be you go to geography they will tell
[59:04] you
[59:11] exist if you want to go through
[59:13] archology
[59:16] you still
[59:18] prove that the Bible is
[59:23] truth I passed through Egypt on my way
[59:25] to to to I mean to
[59:29] Israel
[59:33] yes and in
[59:35] Egypt there is a museum
[59:38] [Music]
[59:41] there that tormented the children of
[59:45] Israel is there in the glass the
[59:49] museum you see the body is dried
[59:52] up that that body is there
[59:56] so that when we tell you that there was
[59:59] a who
[1:00:01] commended the children of
[1:00:03] Israel
[1:00:05] historically
[1:00:07] archeologically you can prove
[1:00:11] that when the Bible tells you that there
[1:00:14] were pyramids or pyramids in
[1:00:17] Egypt those pyramids are still there
[1:00:21] even today you can go there I went there
[1:00:25] and the
[1:00:26] pyramids it is true the Israel built
[1:00:32] pyamid and what
[1:00:34] not if they tell you that there was
[1:00:39] M Elijah the prophet one man in the
[1:00:43] hands of God challenged the prophets of
[1:00:46] God my brothers there's
[1:00:50] m in isra and your brother by God's
[1:00:54] grace
[1:00:56] stepped on
[1:01:00] those of the Tomb I went into the tomb
[1:01:04] and I stood there is this way my
[1:01:08] master so so I also
[1:01:13] resurrect even if you bury me I will
[1:01:17] just follow the example of my
[1:01:19] master I will
[1:01:22] resurrect I have all reason to believe
[1:01:25] that
[1:01:27] because I gave you a testimony that in
[1:01:30] 2006 I died but I asked the author of
[1:01:34] Life bring me back to life and I lived
[1:01:38] again and you see me today I'm a living
[1:01:43] testimony yes
[1:01:44] sir in case the doubting Thomas is
[1:01:48] here who don't believe that I mean
[1:01:52] Christianity is something that is real
[1:01:56] when you are looking at
[1:01:57] me I'm a living
[1:02:00] testimony I rose from the
[1:02:03] dead just like
[1:02:05] Lazarus just
[1:02:07] like and many others
[1:02:09] in yes that came back to
[1:02:12] life we have proved proven these
[1:02:16] things we are really
[1:02:18] convinced that this is a true
[1:02:22] faith my brothers one day well I got I
[1:02:27] felt
[1:02:28] compassion the
[1:02:31] Muslims and I went to a
[1:02:33] mosque I went there and I I wanted to
[1:02:37] find out if I can get
[1:02:40] one from the
[1:02:42] MOs so I went there MOS you have to know
[1:02:48] how they
[1:02:49] do so I
[1:02:53] asked how do you go about you take off
[1:02:56] your shoes and I took off my
[1:02:59] shoes say you took off
[1:03:02] everything you wash their
[1:03:05] feet and wash your
[1:03:07] head put
[1:03:10] water three
[1:03:12] times you your
[1:03:16] Shir and then you you enter
[1:03:19] the so I did
[1:03:22] that yes but however in Theos
[1:03:26] they don't sit on comfortable
[1:03:30] chairs and I wonder why you don't hear
[1:03:33] the word of
[1:03:35] God why don't you understand the word of
[1:03:38] God and why you don't
[1:03:40] believe because the Muslims they don't
[1:03:44] sit on
[1:03:45] CH they sit on
[1:03:47] FL FL like
[1:03:51] this then they start
[1:03:54] worshiping
[1:03:57] Arabic in
[1:03:59] Arabic and me I joined
[1:04:05] them I join the
[1:04:08] Muslims they sit in
[1:04:13] RS been to
[1:04:15] ethopia he knows that that's what they
[1:04:18] do I had to do
[1:04:22] that and when they were praying Arabic
[1:04:25] language me I was praying in
[1:04:29] Jonah they will not hear or understand
