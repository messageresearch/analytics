somewhere we read about uh this revelation chapter six verses two [Music] some time ago i had a privilege of standing in lisbon a banger named lisbon portuguese and i went up to that old gallery where they used to have slaves and prisoners of war lisbon he was a hero because he had taken the great city area praise be to god i mean it's like you go to museum cheering up again i'm a museum and you find a picture of a hero somebody to watch his sins that praise me to god i mean when they take that something so great and so important and the world has been full of heroes [Music] [Music] most especially in europe there are some people those are those ancient battles [Music] not until i read in this message that was the revelation which god revealed to this man to constantine because [Music] [Applause] [Applause] says [Applause] is [Applause] it was his country yeah on the second year talk of all the world's super powers this man conquered the whole world three years [Applause] and the prophet says that in those days human necrosis maybe when you want your baby to sleep they had a slogan they used to say like maybe the uh the wookman will come for you praise oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] germany the sky was darkened by only one plane germany because the mighty man was coming back [Music] [Music] amen that is a good lesson for the church of the living god if we don't play the game according to the rules we game we are running the race in this race we are running emirates we have got the rules governing it takes upon them that you want only those who are following the rule of the game praise be to god amen napoleon played the game in the wrong way [Applause] [Applause] but when jesus changes his we might be the greatest denomination sorry if we uh if the rule of the game in this place is a man must be born again to enter into the fellowship of christ and his church christ but if we haven't played the rule of the game we will be disqualified at the end now you want to talk goodbye we are bragging about our great church our big powerful pastor i'm assuming but have you ever thought never you know was this have you ever asked yourself are we following the rule of the game oh [Applause] i mean but god goes with minority [Applause] not what you think [Music] [Music] being a great warrior and great conqueror napoleoni he conquered the people under fear praise you to god i mean even our days now some of this man you go ask your pastor again the bible says i read some scripture here and be careful it doesn't make any difference how much we feel like that we are progressing until we get back to the rule of the game praise be to god and the strongest force that i know of is love so if we are going to play this game as we would call it we are going to win we know and we have got to go back to the winning principles [Applause] home get those kids dressings but take them out of your way because you want to go back to the winning principles maybe for [Applause] go kick them out praise be to god i mean some of these things are some of our brothers will be surprised you will go back home from work john the [Applause] amen fear must be forced why do you know sometimes you wonder when we are at church before even we come to fellowship [Music] but when you enter in the spirit of god amen i mean nowadays there's something that i was looking at

great thing praise be to god amina when your life has no foundation you know there are many foundations sample their foundation others feel their foundation on the things of the world [Applause] and that is what each individuals of the church owe to bypass in their hearts to do their very best for the kingdom of god and how do you serve god here when you are serving one another when you are when you are taking the little one when you are taking the little end of their own as it was to say amen amen and men who was ever mounted to down and became not great men sorry and men who have never mounted very much in the world has been men who come down [Music] they made them so small in order to accomplish a purpose praise be to god amen amen i mean you hear what you are saying that that is what is that what is in the figure of the church oh to bypass in the heart a we have to take each one of us to purpose in our heart why would that fail not to renew my religion with image of faith
