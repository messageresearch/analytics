Uh we are going to go straight to the word. [Music] We are going to read from the book of Daniel. Daniel chapter one. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. If you are there, you say amen. Daniel chapter [Music] 1. It's going to be a long reading, [Music] but we shall read up to uh verse seven. Uh then you take your seats. Then uh we shall read up to the last verse. It says, "In the third year of the reign of Joakim, king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. And the Lord gave Yakim, king of Judah, into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Sha to the house of his God. And he brought the vessels into the treasure of the house of his God. And the king spake unto a Aspenaz the master of the unax that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's seed and the princes children in whom was no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace. and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the child. And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank, so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they may stand before the king. Now among uh these were the children of Judah, Daniel, Ana, uh Michel and as a Aar and to whom the prince of the Enochs gave names. Therefore, he gave unto Daniel the name Bel Shaza, unto Ania Shadrach, unto Michel Mishak, unto [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Fore! Foreign! [Music] Foreign! [Music] [Music] Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Fore speech. [Music] Canadia. [Music] [Music] Amen. Amen. You may take your seats. Let's have a word of prayer. Precious loving father, uh we thank you, oh God, for the portion of the word which has been read. [Music] Lord, uh you said in your word, father, that blessed is he who reads and blessed is he who hears the word of this book. So precious loving father we welcome you in this place come and take this bread of life Lord and break it for us Lord I pray for me myself Lord and my my interpreter I'm just a man I pray Lord that you take me out of the way and you speak to the needs of your children. We ask your blessings Lord in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Are you happy to be in the house of God? Amen. Amen. You know standing here is not always easy. You will always be nervous. Hallelujah. Amen. Because it does not depend on your ability or what you've studied or Amen but depends on God. We stand here to be used of God. So it always makes us nervous. But God is gracious. He gives us strength. Amen. So we where we've read in the book of Daniel, it is a simple story about uh this man Daniel. Uh history says that this happened around 350 years before Jesus Christ was born as as we read in the first first verse that it began with uh the siege of Jerusalem. King Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem. When he attacked Jerusalem, he besieged it. Amen. So when he besieged it, the Lord had given Jerusalem unto the hands of King Nebuchadnezzar because of the disobedience of the children of Israel. Amen. Amen. So he gave he he gave them to the hands of their enemies. But when they were given to the hands of their enemies, the Bible says that when the king had beseeched Jerusalem that he took all the treasures which were in the temple, he took them in the house of his gods. And the other thing he did he the Bible says that he he told he told one of his his master of the unax he told him that you should bring a certain of the children of Israel of the king's seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish. Notice he had taken the treasures in the in the temple. But he didn't stop there. He also told his uno that make sure you bring children which are children who come from the king's lineage. He said that these children have to have no blemish. They have to be well favored. They have to be skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace. This is the this is the qualification he wanted that the children he has to choose they have to to meet these qualifications. Why? Because they are going to serve him. Hallelujah. He continues on. He says that when when they when this man chose these children out of out of because remember the kingdom was was was attacked and it was besieged. So he he chose children out of these out of these of these children who are young in this in this kingdom. Amen. And he said he told the king told this man that he appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat. Amen. He told him, "A daily a daily provision of the king's meat." Hallelujah. Because they were going to stand before the king. Amen. Amen. The meat is to make them ready to serve the king. Because this you cannot serve the king when you are weak, when you are looking hungry. So he told him you you have to give them the food that I eat because they are going to stand before me and serve before me. Amen. The Bible says that in these they were children uh of Judah named Daniel, Haniah, Mishael and Ael. And he said in verse seven, he said that in these four in these four children, because the Bible says they were children, he says that he gave them new names. And he gave them other names. Hallelujah. They were given the Babylonian names. Hallelujah. But there was something about uh uh these four children. These four children. If you read from verse 8 to go down, I won't read all through. But if you read this whole chapter in verse 8, it shows that Daniel was purposed in his heart that he's not going to defile himself with the meat which was offered unto him. Amen. Amen. The Bible continues to say that God gave them favor because of that decision they had made. because they had chose the way of God. Hallelujah. Because the Bible tells us that uh uh that the other children for them they accepted to eat the meat. But for Daniel and these four these three other other children they they said no we shall not eat this meat. And the Bible says that the Enoch tried to to encourage them to eat. He encouraged them to eat this meat because the king had commanded commanded him to give them the meat. But the Bible says that Daniel said, "No, we shall not eat this meat." He told he told him you just give us uh he told he told he told the king you just he told him you just give us you don't give us this meat you just give us this you know vegetables and uh without the meat of the king and the and the wine of the king he said don't give us that you just give us this normal normal normal food and he told he told this man that You give us 10 days. You You try us in 10 days. And after these 10 days, you shall compare us with the other ones who ate the king's meat and us who did not eat it. The Bible says that they they were given what they had asked. And after 10 days, the Bible tells us that the the four children eat the the meat. Hallelujah. And the Bible continues to say that after that God blessed them. He the Bible says he gave them knowledge and skill in learning and wisdom. The Bible says that and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So the the Bible continues to say that after that that the king called them these these these four [Music] boys and when he called them he loved them because they had found favor in the eyes of the king. Amen. So like you know like what happened to these boys when they were in Israel? It happens to us in our lives. Amen. We the human race. We are caught we are caught up. We were caught up between the disobedience of of our fathers. Adam. When Adam disobeyed God, God judged Adam and the the judgment fell on his seed after him. Like you see these boys because they were young. When the king attacked them, they were young. They didn't know anything. They didn't they didn't put any input in in what made the king to come and attack them. But it just happened they found themselves in that kind of situation. Amen. The Bible says in Romans 5 12, it says that therefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so forth passed upon all men for that all have sinned. Hallelujah. Some of us are sick without our input. We are simply caught up in the disobedience of those who came before us. Hallelujah. Amen. You you you have a sickness which is tormenting you but you just you just got it from your forefathers. You are not there when they did what made them get that that sickness. But you are now suffering. because you came from them. Hallelujah. That teaches us what? That the decisions we make, they don't stop on us. Amen. Amen. They they go on unto our descendants after us. For example, a mother or a father who teaches not to who decides not to teach his children the will of the Lord. Amen. The children are the one who get in the suffering because for them they have aged they have little time. The punishment goes on the children. Some of us the the the the the sins which easily beset us they they caught us when we are when we are young. Amen. When we are young because maybe we didn't have godly parents who could teach us who could teach us that this is wrong. This is this is like this according to the word and we are caught up in that kind of environment. Amen. I believe in continuity of a blessing. Even when when you make the right decision, the blessing of God does not stop only on you, it goes on unto your descendants. When God when God blessed Abraham, he also blessed his seed after him. When God blessed David, he also blessed Solomon, after when Solomon disobeyed God, the Bible says that God said, "I'm not going to take away this kingdom from Solomon because of his father." Hallelujah. So, we can we can get blessings because of the decisions of our father. For example, this place we are enjoying, we are not the ones who built it. Amen. Amen. There is a man who came and toiled and labored but now we are enjoying it. Amen. We as a Christians should learn the decisions we we make either right or wrong the things which overcome us they will overcome our children. The things we overcome it will be so easy for our children to overcome. Hallelujah. So the Bible says that the king when the king chose chose these these children, he chose those who are blameless. Amen. Amen. The king was typing uh uh the devil. Brother Brham says that the devil wants to use beautiful things. the the the the king, he chose he told him, "You go and look for those children who are blameless, who are wise." Amen. Amen. And you bring them. Amen. Amen. The devil wants to use beautiful things. He wants to build his kingdom but using God's instruments. Remember God is the one who you remember the sacrifice in the Old Testament. It was a sacrifice which was a lamb without blemish. The devil is a copy. He tries to copy what God is trying to make and he tries to use it in his own perverted way. Let me read a quote here where brother Brham talks about that. Let me read that quote here. It's in the message the message three kinds of believers. He says Satan is the one that dwells in beauty. That's exactly what the scripture says. That's the reason sometimes a pretty woman is a bait for Satan. If he can just get a hold of her, he can twist more men into hell than he could than he could with all the Bums in this country. That's right. See, oh handsome, oh great handsome man, that without stand up in his trueeness of manhood. Amen. He can swing them women to the devil and to send them to hell. Yes, sir. He says, notice Satan dwells in beauty. What did he try to do in the beginning? Make a more beautiful kingdom than Michael was. Hallelujah. So you see you see the tactics of the devil. Amen. The people who who who if the like brother Brham has said here, if you go to see these people who who sell themselves on the on the roads, these prostitutes. They are not ugly women. They are not ugly. The devil chooses the beautiful and he wants to use them to build his kingdom. Hallelujah. But this kingdom was given to them by God. Because these children of Israel, this Daniel, the wisdom they had, it was given by God. They were simply taken from the other kingdom using Godgiven privileges that they had. Now this king desired to use those same same things. Amen. The devil does not have uh what he what he needs to build his kingdom. He uses the people of God, uses their beauty. Amen. And deceives them to build his own kingdom. Notice the king tked one of his uns. Amen. Amen. to he told him that you have to make sure that you give these these the these children daily meat and and and wine from from my where I eat from. Hallelujah. The devil is on our case daily. Hallelujah. The devil does not give you rest. The king tked this man that make sure daily. Hallelujah. That's why you cannot be a Christian on Sunday Christian on Wednesday and other days you are not a Christian. Hallelujah. Because the devil uses I'm going to Okay, I'm going to Let's open in First Corinthians 15:31. 1 Corinthians 15:31. 15 31. It says, it says, says, I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I die [Music] daily. Hallelujah. Amen. Paul is telling us that he dies daily. Amen. The battle is is a daily [Music] battle. Hallelujah. Because the devil has assigned his demons to make sure every day. Every day. Make sure you bring them meat. Every day. Daily. Amen. There's no time to rest. Hallelujah. That's why also Paul has told us we have to die daily in one quote he says that in the morning you can wake up when you're Christian and at night you go to bed when you a sinner amen because you've not fought daily you've known the you've not fought the battle amen since the devil's attacks are daily What God does, he also gives us a daily bread. Hallelujah. In his prayer, he told us that we should pray to God to give us a daily break. Why? Because we are attacked daily. So, we have to be empowered daily. Hallelujah. We are not Christians on certain days. We have to be Christian daily. Hallelujah. There's another brother emphasizes on that thing. Let me read it here very fast. He says it is. He says, "And now sin caused all this to happen. And God through this age is gathering up his material. Satan is still here. Present tense is still here. Amen. Amen. That's the reason all these things happen. He is still here. And all of his evil forces are still here. Notice that's why the earth is full of filth. That's why the scam and ridiculous things that goes on, bloodshed, war, politics, sin, adultery, all kinds of filthiness goes on is because that Satan is the ruler of this atmosphere. Hallelujah. Amen. Satan is here. Amen. That's why we see these these things daily. We see murderers. Amen. We see we see politics, sin, adultery. Amen. Let me tell you. Don't be caught up in those things. Amen. Those demons are assigned by Satan. They attack us. So you should learn that these are the attacks of the enemy. Amen. What I'm trying to do, I'm trying to show us the the tactics that the devil uses and to attack us. Amen. He says that the daily meant was meant to make them ready to serve the king. Notice in this age we have we have uh so many things of entertainment and often times some of us are caught up in those things for example these apps Tik Tok and words when you go and watch that thing the entertainment of the world often times when sometimes when you go even to sleep You start dreaming what you saw. Hallelujah. Amen. And imagine people who feed on that day. It is a preparation by the enemy. Amen. Amen. Such that he's going to use him to serve him. Hallelujah. They don't begin when they are worse off. They begin slowly. daily, daily, daily, daily. Hallelujah. Just just like you see sickness when you go to the hospital when you when you've just uh uh received the sickness and uh they tell you it's good you've come early. Amen. But when you go late for example the imag you know cancer you know that there are people who go to the hospital and they tell them that this cancer is in the latest stages the devil has already he for all of you he has eaten you it's a tactic he eats you lady, the the longer you you you take without going to the hospital, when you go there, you already finished. Why? Because he know he knows. He goes to you daily. Notice the Enoch gave them names. Hallelujah. They took away their names. They took away their god-given names. They gave them other names. the names of Babylon. Hallelujah. The same thing that the devil calls, the devil does to many of us in this world because we are caught up in maybe families which are adulterous families, drunkards. He calls you those names. He calls you poor. Because you have that name. Your your father is poor. When you see you are poor, your lineage is poor. So he gives you a name. Amen. A name. He calls you a failure. He calls you poor. He calls you confused. He called you a beggar. He called you blind, deaf, dump. You a holy roller. Hallelujah. The same tactic like we see here. Hallelujah. They remove their names. They gave them their other names. But the Bible is so interesting. The Bible does not say the book of what they called Daniel in in Babylon. Amen. God does not call you by this name. God does not call you a failure. He does not call you poor, confused or a beggar. Amen. He calls you his name. You are still a child no matter the condition you are in. Amen. Amen. And there's something which these boys did. Amen. Which is so interesting. Amen. Amen. God does not call us but by what the world calls us. Amen. Amen. In the Bible, there is no book of Baltas. There is a book of Daniel. God does not know the name they call us here. Amen. Amen. We are from his kingdom. We have his name. Amen. His character in us. He still calls us by that. Hallelujah. Amen. The Bible says that God calls us beloved. He calls us little children. He calls us blessed above all things. He calls us the apple of his eye. Hallelujah. Amen. So we should learn to reject these names that the the world is giving us that the devil is giving us. Hallelujah. Because Daniel did it. Daniel rejected what was offered unto him. Amen. We should also reject the devil's offers to our lives. Amen. Amen. Anything that comes from the devil, however much it looks like uh it is good, you have to reject it. Amen. Amen. Even if it is medicine and it comes from the devil, don't receive it. Amen. What disqualifies the medicine because it has come from the devil. Amen. Amen. The devil does not wish good and worse. Amen. Daniel rejected the the meat. Amen. He was typing that we should also reject the doctrines. Amen. Which are in this world. There are so many doctrines in this world. Amen. Amen. Concerning for example, let me say becoming rich is some some friend I had was preaching to me telling me in this world you can never be rich if you don't steal. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. It was it was the devil's meat. Amen. Amen. giving me his meat because he wants me to eat it. Hallelujah. There are so many things he gives us to eat. Amen. You can never have a successful marriage when you are young. You need to have you know the things the world says. You need to first enjoy the world. My brother, you will marry when you are aged there. That is the devil's meat. Amen. That is not our meat. Amen. We should not eat it. We should reject it. Amen. For example, the devil has brought sicknesses in our lives, poverty, depression, disappointments. Amen. Doubt he's offering it to us daily. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I believe we all fight these battles. Amen. Often times you feel depressed. You feel disappointed. You've worked. You've worked. You don't see any breakthrough. When the devil preaches to you, ah that for you, you live to be disappointed. Hallelujah. Amen. Those are the devil's meat. We should learn to reject it. He does not stop there. He brings anger. Amen. Hatred, malice, he's offering it to us. Does God offer us anger? Does he offer us hatred or malice or sickness? Amen. These are these are things from the enemy. Amen. If you notice you are becoming you you feel like you are trying to hurt some person just know that the devil has assigned that demon come to you. Amen. You have to resist it. You have to reject it. Hallelujah. In James 4:7 the Bible says let's read there very fast. James 4:7 James 4:7 says, "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you." Hallelujah. You have to resist him. Notice he won't walk. He will flee. He will flee from you. Hallelujah. When you resist him, when you reject his offers, hallelujah. And after that, the Bible tells us that after they had rejected this meat, this drink from the table of the king, the Bible tells us that then God gave them favor. Amen. In Babylon, favor before the king. Amen. We also can get this favor. But for us to get this favor in this world, We have to first be obedient and we reject the offers that the devil is offering us. God cannot bless us before we first rejected. Hallelujah. The offers of the enemy. blessing those who reject Satan's offer with what is greater than what Satan offers. For example, Jesus when Satan came and tempted him, he offered him the kingdom. Hallelujah. What did Jesus do? He rejected that offer. Hallelujah. Why? Because the kingdom of the devil has an end. Hallelujah. And God gave Christ after he rejected that a kingdom without an end. Hallelujah. What does that tell us? That after we've rejected the devil's offers, God is going to give us. Amen. Amen. Which has no end. Amen. Amen. If you reject that worldly boyfriend or girlfriend, he will bless you with a genuine daughter. Oh son of God. But you have to first reject. Hallelujah. Often times the challenge we have, we don't reject the devil's offers and we try to pray God to give us. Amen. Amen. They can't. Darkness and light can't walk together. Amen. Amen. You have to choose one. Amen. Amen. The Bible says that Daniel told this un days, I'm sure, you will see that we shall be better than the other ones. We are preaching uh uh uh outdoor and uh brother Anga he was the one preach. He said that if you bring a person and you tell him you obey the word uh obey the word as it says you do and you bring another one and you tell him you don't do you don't follow anything in the word and you bring them after one year there will be a very big difference the one who will believe the word, you wouldn't compare him with the one who has rejected the word. Amen. It is what happened here because Daniel rejected the food which was offered unto him. Amen. And he decided not to eat it. Amen. And he ate the normal food. The name of was typing the word, typing the message. He was a better man. They were better children than all the others who accepted to eat the kings. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. The Bible says that following Christ produces the better quality of life. or the better quality of people. You know our leaders, they try to make laws to make sure people are in order. That won't work. Amen. Man was made to break the law. Amen. Imagine Adam had one law. Only one thing God told don't do it. He broke it. Just one. How many? And you think he will keep all these these many? He will just break them. Amen. Amen. Amen. Because that's his nature. Amen. Amen. It it does not take laws to produce a better kind of life. It takes Christ. It takes the word. Hallelujah. Even in marriage, the better kind of marriage is the marriage of the Christian. The better business, it is the business of the Christian. Hallelujah. What? What? Daniel, you remember what what what happened to Daniel? They had the better. They were fairer than all the others. Amen. Following Christ produces a more fulfilled life than all other ways of life. Hallelujah. Amen. Don't accept the reasons of the devil. Hallelujah. Remember what this un told them that you won't make it. You're going to enjoy the Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But they had that revelation. They knew that they were not of that kingdom. Hallelujah. We are not of this kingdom. We are not of this world. Like for them they were taken from Israel. The physical Israel they they were taken to Babylon. We are also we are just fallen here. We are not of this world. We are children of God. We came from God. We are just here to pastor. So we should have that revelation. Hallelujah. And we should reject the offers of the truth. Hallelujah. My message was Daniel in Babylon. Let me end with a quote. Amen. He says the message life story. He says, "And we each and we each one have a life that God has given [Music] us, we must live it." And I to my humble opinion if you will get this I think the best life in the world the best life in the world no matter whether it's up or down if you will find God's path and walk in it where God has ordained us to walk. If we always if we always walk in that way that God has ordained for us to walk in we find victory no matter. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Hallelujah. God bless you.
