[1:18:00] for the evidence of Things Not Seen for
[1:18:03] by it the elders obtained a good report
[1:18:06] through faith we understand that the
[1:18:09] words were framed by the word of God
[1:18:12] so that the things which are seen we are
[1:18:15] not made of things which do appear
[1:18:18] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:18:21] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[1:18:24] you obtained witness that he was
[1:18:26] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[1:18:29] and by it he being dead yet speaking is

[1:20:08] yeah oh right here I don't never know
[1:20:11] that was the best that you have ever

[1:20:18] the little ones also sang a very good
[1:20:24] amen I mean Hallelujah
[1:20:29] Hallelujah
[1:20:31] the Lord is good the Lord is good
[1:20:38] amen Amina please somebody the deacons
[1:20:41] remind me if I forget I just want few to
[1:20:43] go straight into the word but after the
[1:20:45] word I would like to update you
[1:20:47] regarding our land funds
[1:20:54] so if I forget the deacons are the
[1:20:57] problems
[1:21:04] this series this is the fifth time we're
[1:21:07] speaking on this
[1:21:10] and how men are being really being
[1:21:13] blessed
[1:21:15] how men are not being blessed
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:20] okay so uh really when sometimes we ask
[1:21:25] I seems to be your brother when I'm I'm
[1:21:28] out there
[1:21:30] I sense to be a brother when I'm out
[1:21:31] there
[1:21:35] when I come up here
[1:21:37] speaking on behalf of the Lord
[1:21:41] everybody is coming to speak to you in
[1:21:44] the name of the Lord
[1:21:47] sometimes
[1:21:48] and tell you do
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:23] and the Bible says you see it is more
[1:22:25] blessed to well it says that obedience
[1:22:28] is better than sacrifice
[1:22:31] so let us be obedient
[1:22:34] be the presence
[1:22:37] Hallelujah I mean as a matter of fact I
[1:22:40] love some I love the way people in
[1:22:42] Zimbabwe are so obedient to the spirit
[1:22:46] you see sometimes even when the preacher
[1:22:49] is preaching
[1:22:51] [Music]
[1:23:45] this morning I'm going to continue on
[1:23:48] this subject maybe I'll finish them
[1:23:49] maybe I'm not too sure let's see so the
[1:23:51] power of Revelation today I am dealing
[1:23:54] with a few more things
[1:23:59] and really this is a kind of a teaching
[1:24:03] but because I don't know whether I'm a
[1:24:06] teacher or not I just preach it so let
[1:24:07] us see
[1:24:10] I've spoken in some places and some
[1:24:12] people say that I'm a teacher
[1:24:15] but I don't believe I'm a teacher
[1:24:18] I believe I'm just a preacher
[1:24:21] you know a preacher just can take one
[1:24:23] person and and you know get into things
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:29] sometimes we get into quotes into
[1:24:31] scriptures into verses into now
[1:24:35] I guess I'm just being a pastor to you
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:48] now Faith is a substance of things hoped
[1:24:51] foreign
[1:26:04] do you understand what I'm saying it is
[1:26:07] the evidence of the things you have not
[1:26:11] yet seen
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:13] and the Bible now clearly says here
[1:26:17] actually in Hebrews 11 the whole chapter
[1:26:21] he was giving many examples
[1:26:24] of people that had faith
[1:26:27] and here in this verse 4 he says by
[1:26:31] faith
[1:26:34] he offered unto God a more excellent
[1:26:37] sacrifice foreign
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:53] [Applause]
[1:28:32] [Applause]
[1:28:34] he can never change them a bit foreign
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:30:22] that is why they are preached for two
[1:30:24] thousand years
[1:31:05] somehow they will always be living
[1:31:14] on them because
[1:31:28] foreign
[1:31:47] foreign
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:19] foreign
[1:32:55] and so the Bible now clearly says here
[1:32:58] by faith
[1:33:00] you offered unto God
[1:33:03] more excellent sacrifice
[1:33:08] let me ask you a question why did God
[1:33:11] not accept Cain's sacrifice
[1:33:15] the reason is simple because he did not
[1:33:19] give it by faitha
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:31] that was good sacrifice it was the best
[1:33:35] of the best
[1:33:37] please follow me don't miss this
[1:33:44] and so Cain was a farmer
[1:33:48] who made it
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:34:15] will you not be accepted
[1:34:29] [Applause]
[1:34:39] so this is why I'm preaching on this it
[1:34:41] is because there is power in Revelation
[1:34:45] some of you may be wondering why are you
[1:34:47] saying faith and again Revelations
[1:34:50] God has sent to us
[1:34:56] that what is faith
[1:34:59] faith is the revelation of the will of
[1:35:02] God
[1:35:07] hallelujah
[1:35:10] did not know what God required
[1:35:14] in the sacrifice
[1:35:17] Cain gave apples
[1:35:20] peers
[1:35:21] and everything else
[1:35:26] and when it went as a battle foreign
[1:35:39] foreign
[1:36:14] adultery or Wednesday
[1:36:17] even this happened
[1:36:22] the Bible says
[1:36:39] requires blood today
[1:36:44] foreign
[1:36:56] they ate up us
[1:37:06] by Faith by the eyes of foreign
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:39] oh
[1:37:48] he said thank God
[1:37:55] let me just speak one of myself
[1:37:57] that's the advantage
[1:38:01] I believe of us
[1:38:05] that's the advantage
[1:38:13] that's the advantage a seed of God has
[1:38:23] boots exactly what he puts you in
[1:38:26] exactly where you are supposed to be to
[1:38:28] attain what you need to attained
[1:38:36] but the other seats
[1:38:38] it is very hard for them but if they
[1:38:42] also did exactly what you did
[1:38:44] and they humbled themselves
[1:38:49] but oftentimes they can't
[1:38:51] because they can see it
[1:38:54] they don't see it but thank God
[1:38:59] we are blessing in his kingdom
[1:39:11] hallelujah amen
[1:39:16] today
[1:39:24] we are right here we are right here
[1:39:28] sacrifice has already been given yeah
[1:39:35] foreign
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:04] foreign
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:29] [Applause]
[1:40:31] friends we need Revelation
[1:40:34] the Bible says without Revelations
[1:41:04] it is
[1:41:27] expected to have a disconnection
[1:42:29] yes all right we are still in the world
[1:42:31] foreign
[1:43:33] [Applause]
[1:43:36] foreign let us be connected
[1:43:40] so that someone feel that in their heart
[1:43:42] if you feel it should listen to those
[1:43:45] who feel it
[1:43:49] gotta be connected
[1:43:52] Hallelujah be connected to the world
[1:43:55] Amen cut yourself from the world
[1:44:01] come cut yourself
[1:44:11] ugly movies
[1:45:04] you can never be changed
[1:45:12] was not disconnected
[1:45:16] from his ideas
[1:45:20] why can't God accept me
[1:45:24] God doesn't accept you on your time
[1:45:29] you have to drop your ideas
[1:45:42] let him lead them
[1:45:57] and then watch the light begin to work
[1:46:01] oh my God hallelujah changing every
[1:46:04] place every place in your life
[1:46:08] when I say every place and everything I
[1:46:10] mean
[1:46:21] it makes you happy when you are down
[1:46:24] cast
[1:46:26] when you don't have friends
[1:46:29] when you don't have good Associates
[1:46:41] if you don't have foreign
[1:46:57] disappointed
[1:48:29] that is
[1:48:34] the power of Revelations
[1:48:40] righteousness is not the works you did
[1:48:44] works of righteousness
[1:48:47] you know the righteousness and Holiness
[1:48:50] is
[1:48:54] faith if you have faith in God
[1:48:58] you see what others
[1:49:01] they will call you a fool for a season
[1:49:09] because you haven't attended yet
[1:49:16] because faith is
[1:49:21] believing and holding on to God
[1:49:27] believing that by faith
[1:49:30] you have to do this and then God will do
[1:49:33] the rest
[1:49:34] recorded
[1:49:36] shall we go to the Book of Luke we will
[1:49:38] take this today as our as our
[1:49:42] case study Luke 7 36
[1:49:48] um
[1:49:56] praise the Lord
[1:50:00] my intention is always to speak to you
[1:50:02] for an hour
[1:50:05] because I believe within an hour you've
[1:50:08] already got enough foreign
[1:50:58] house and sat down to meet and behold a
[1:51:01] woman in the city which was a sinner
[1:51:03] when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in
[1:51:05] the Pharisees house brought an alabaster
[1:51:08] box for intimate and stood At His Feet
[1:51:10] behind him weeping and began to wash his
[1:51:13] feet and with the tears and did wipe
[1:51:15] them with the hairs of of her head and
[1:51:18] kissed his feet and anointed them with
[1:51:20] the ointment now whenever Pharisee which
[1:51:23] had been in him saw it he spoke within
[1:51:25] himself saying this man if he were a
[1:51:28] prophet would have known Who had who and
[1:51:31] what manner of woman this is that
[1:51:34] touches him for she is a sinner and
[1:51:36] Jesus answered him say that to him Simon
[1:51:39] I have somewhere to say unto thee and he
[1:51:42] said Master say on there was a certain
[1:51:45] creditor which had two debt us the one
[1:51:48] owed 500 Pence and the other 50 and when
[1:51:51] they had nothing to pay he frankly
[1:51:54] forgave them both tell me the wrong for
[1:51:56] Simon which of them will heal
[1:51:59] love most or which one which of them
[1:52:02] will love him most
[1:52:04] Simon answered and said I suppose that
[1:52:07] that he to whom he forgive most and he
[1:52:10] said unto him thou has rightly judged
[1:52:13] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:52:16] Simon says Thou this woman I entered
[1:52:18] into thine house thou gaveth me no water
[1:52:21] for for my feet but she gave she has
[1:52:24] washed my
[1:52:26] my feet with with the tears and wiped
[1:52:29] them with the hairs of her head thou
[1:52:31] gavest me no kiss but this woman since
[1:52:34] the time I came in has not ceased to
[1:52:36] kiss my feet
[1:52:38] my head with oil without it is not
[1:52:40] anoint but this woman has anointed my
[1:52:44] feet with ointment whatever I say unto
[1:52:47] thee has sins which are many oh my God
[1:52:52] are forgiven for she loved much but whom
[1:52:56] little is given the same love with
[1:52:58] little and he said unto her thy sins are
[1:53:01] forgiven
[1:53:03] and they that sat at meat with him began
[1:53:06] to say within themselves who is this
[1:53:08] that forgiveth or sins also and he said
[1:53:11] unto the woman thy faith has saved thee
[1:53:14] go in peace
[1:53:22] oh my God I have a lot on my heart in
[1:53:25] this about the scripture
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:28] I'm trying to wonder whether I'm going
[1:53:30] to even go a little halfway
[1:53:33] because each of us can be a summary
[1:53:36] so let me try to just bring it as the
[1:53:39] spirit will give utterance
[1:53:42] so here is a woman
[1:53:44] and maybe what I'm going to do I'm going
[1:53:46] to pause a little bit and then I come to
[1:53:48] that a little later amen now I will
[1:53:51] first read this quote have that
[1:53:53] scripture in your mind
[1:53:57] says now there is three elements
[1:54:02] listen to me please
[1:54:04] there are three elements that people
[1:54:08] live in three elements that people live
[1:54:11] in
[1:54:12] there is
[1:54:20] that is ten percent of you if you're
[1:54:23] hearing me say Amen
[1:54:26] first
[1:54:27] I don't want to just pound this on you I
[1:54:30] wanted to receive
[1:54:35] is the humanistic
[1:54:54] what is it
[1:54:56] humanistic number two
[1:54:59] divine revelation
[1:55:03] one brother is making a copy there on
[1:55:05] the on the on the screen all right
[1:55:08] humanistic
[1:55:10] Divine Revelations
[1:55:13] now he says now this like in prayer when
[1:55:17] you pray for anyone
[1:55:19] in humanistic
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:21] um
[1:55:22] we say well I hope you will get away
[1:55:36] that is a human
[1:55:41] and it's all right
[1:55:43] when you pray with somebody
[1:55:45] don't speak presumptuously
[1:55:52] with what Authority did you say that
[1:55:55] you have to have
[1:56:55] you know many times I realized I work in
[1:56:59] one of these three rooms
[1:57:03] you know you just pray for somebody and
[1:57:05] you feel nothing you see nothing and you
[1:57:07] know you just tell them well believe in
[1:57:09] God
[1:57:12] but sometimes while I'm praying for
[1:57:15] something you know Revelation just comes
[1:57:18] down
[1:57:19] amen you know maybe for what to say
[1:57:23] and then I begin to tell them in the
[1:57:26] name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:29] always listen to such a thing when you
[1:57:31] are prayed for by a picture
[1:57:36] usually big attentive
[1:57:38] many times when divine revelation comes
[1:57:42] you need to tap into that again and also
[1:57:46] you need to believe well it is revealed
[1:57:49] to him and it is not revealed to you
[1:57:53] it's very difficult for you to manifest
[1:57:55] in your life
[1:57:57] foreign
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:06] one time remove many I was praying in
[1:58:09] the church
[1:58:10] and and you know I would while I'm
[1:58:13] praying with the brothers we're all
[1:58:15] praying
[1:58:16] and the spirit of Revelation to come
[1:58:20] upon me and then I come to this problem
[1:58:23] happened like three or four times
[1:58:32] let me pray with you it is the
[1:58:34] Revelation that I should pray with him
[1:58:40] when God reveals to you things like that
[1:58:42] don't do it
[1:58:46] we should be spiritual people
[1:58:49] you're laid by the spirit of God
[1:58:52] am I preaching to someone here today
[1:58:58] you shout amen it will not hurt me I can
[1:59:01] promise
[1:59:07] I'll tell you I'll tell him I want to
[1:59:09] pray
[1:59:12] foreign
[1:59:23] [Applause]
[1:59:45] foreign
[2:00:17] [Applause]
[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:45] because that is
[2:00:56] one time I think it has happened to me
[2:01:00] and
[2:01:11] she was saying of South Dakota
[2:01:17] is in the god of the message alive
[2:01:27] I'm tired I'm tired
[2:01:39] because you see this woman you cannot
[2:01:41] hug her and comfortable
[2:01:44] sister those pastors
[2:01:54] it's okay
[2:02:01] sisters
[2:02:02] [Music]
[2:02:03] here is our what our Prophet says
[2:02:25] that's why we don't believe in men
[2:02:27] hugging women
[2:02:31] unless she's your mother or your sister
[2:02:38] or your wife
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:42] are you hearing that
[2:02:45] so younger men don't even attempt
[2:02:48] together
[2:02:56] the younger men don't like that
[2:03:00] I have had very many young men come to
[2:03:02] me
[2:03:03] after falling into Temptations rather
[2:03:06] after falling into foreign
[2:03:19] [Music]
[2:03:36] don't look at me as if you're very
[2:03:37] holiday
[2:03:40] so that's why we don't hug sisters
[2:03:45] brothers sisters
[2:03:47] are you hearing me
[2:03:50] I'm seeing Brother Martin his daughter
[2:03:53] right there

[2:04:26] swallow
[2:04:28] you know any man who wants to argue when
[2:04:31] they are not your husband wife or
[2:04:32] brother

[2:57:49] so much more that you will come and give
[2:57:51] more and also sustain your needs
[2:57:54] Solomon
[2:58:20] and that brings us to a total of 23
[2:58:24] million nine hundred thousand nine
[2:58:27] hundred thirty three thousands
[2:58:33] um
[2:58:39] [Applause]
[2:58:42] bless those who have given
[2:58:53] that this number looks too big after we
[2:58:56] have removed all the money we have been
[2:58:58] removed
[2:59:06] so it was telling me that maybe the
[2:59:08] treasurer has made a mistake yeah
[2:59:13] so I also thought maybe they made a
[2:59:15] mistake
[2:59:16] I went back and they confirmed it
[2:59:21] and they did make a mistake so we so
[2:59:25] I've not counted it brother do you have
[2:59:27] a total figure if if these amounts are
[2:59:30] not are not removed you have a total
[2:59:32] figure a turtle figure is
[2:59:42] okay that means he has not added it up
[2:59:45] next time I'll add it up for you
[2:59:49] guys again
[2:59:53] yeah I mean so
[2:59:55] I will add it up for you so you can see
[2:59:57] how much we are losing towards the rent
[2:59:59] Jessica

[3:00:11] in
[3:00:13] in
[3:00:14] almost two years
[3:00:19] and we have foreign
[3:00:27] and we have been paying rent ever since
[3:00:29] using the same money we are collecting
[3:00:30] for landfalls
[3:00:35] now we are paying rent of how much
[3:00:40] what does that mean
[3:00:43] it means not every one of you is giving
[3:00:46] since people are really giving you
[3:00:54] are giving with all their hearts
[3:00:58] but the many of you that are not giving
[3:01:00] you
[3:01:04] are keeping us behind

[3:02:03] doors for you
[3:02:07] should give who are you to to his work
[3:02:10] and those of you who don't have jobs
[3:02:13] but remember you fit at home
[3:02:17] and you take care of your needs
[3:02:20] out of the litter that you have
[3:02:23] enough God can give you a revelation
[3:02:27] to give a percentage of it towards
