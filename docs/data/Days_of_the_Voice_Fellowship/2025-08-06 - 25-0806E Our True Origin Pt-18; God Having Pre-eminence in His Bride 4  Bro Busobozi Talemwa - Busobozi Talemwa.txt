Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Good evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I would like to uh greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um sometimes our Wednesday service is full. Sometimes it is meagerly attended and so today I don't see many who are supposed to be here. Nonetheless, I have an announcement that I I wanted to make being that I'm traveling on on on Sunday. Um, brothers, can you put up the pictures, please? You you may be seated for just a moment. Do you see anything significant there? So, uh this is myself right there &gt;&gt; with um the vendor of the land we are trying to purchase for the church. Um his name is Mr. Mui. So we were there today, yesterday uh rather today with a few brothers. &gt;&gt; I was brother, &gt;&gt; brother, &gt;&gt; brother Martin, brother Neville who was helping us to do the legal stuff and also brother Joel. So this represented us and uh we we we went into some further negotiations with him &gt;&gt; because you know he he we had agreed that uh before before on 7th August we pay a total sum of 100 million shillings after which we shall be remaining with a total of 120 is payable within 8 months. So um of course it's been a struggle raising the 100 million especially because we used much of it uh in in our youth previous youth camp. We used 30 million shillings in excess of our of of of what we were supposed to spend. Of course, you know, because of the change of the venues and we used two venues and many other things also. We had a problem on on our visitors who are supposed to come the speakers. So, we had a lot of um unexpected expenses. So, but I made a decision in the meeting here with the committee and I announced to them that I'm not going to put that burden of the 30 million shieldings on the church. But I I said I'll put it on myself because I made a decision and um without consulting with with the with the church But also um uh I also made it open that if anybody was willing to contribute something towards it, everybody would be open to do that. So of course we were remaining with some sum to make a 100 plus now that 30 which was remaining unpaid. So we from our collections here we made 100 and um now it remained that debt. So um a few people have come up and really contributed towards it generously uh brother Ken of of Nairobi you know we announced what he gave yesterday. I was impressed when sister Monica, she might be streaming. She she she texted me and said, "Pastor, I have informed my group because she's one of the team leaders of the groups, one of the groups, my group, specifically Martin." &gt;&gt; And so they said that uh they contributed, they collected a certain amount which would support on that debt and yesterday they sent 110,000 shillings. And I thought uh that was really might you might say well it's not covering a lot but it shows the burden and the sacrifice and and that's what we need to have brethren. It's not about the total amount of funds that you give. It's about the sacrifice, the labors and and the desire to serve God. And also sister John called me. She said, "Pastor, we've been praying and um you know this need was brought before our group and said that she told me in one hour I'm going to send $100." And uh you know she said it in dollars. I was like, "Okay." So, I think God is going to lift her a standard. So she sent $100 &gt;&gt; to to the treasurers &gt;&gt; and also sister Esther gave I also announced that on Sunday, &gt;&gt; brother Daniel gave and uh these have all been sacrificial offerings and I have had to you know personally borrow some funds and and ensure that we we we meet our our deadline. And so I have the good news that I have for you today in that picture is that today we paid a total sum of 100 million shillings. If you have been collecting money for four years, you know what this means to us. It's a total sacrifice. But we are so happy that we have been able to reach that milestone. So um so today we we we we topped up 90. We had already given him 10. So that is 100 out of 240 and so we are remaining with a balance of 120. So we try to negotiate with him to give us a more um um payment schedule that is more friendly to us. But even then 8 months is still a lot for a business person. But incidentally we were able to at least get another deal which is better than eight months. Uh we are going to pay the balance in 12 months. In 12 months from from today 12 months from today. So that uh which month are we in? We're beginning August. Yes. So by August next year, we must be done with that uh payment. You know, I was with the brothers. One of the brothers said pastor and actually it opened all our eyes those of us who were there. He said but uh if cuz it is 120. If each of the church members and those who are supporting us that are able and we we we count 100 people who are able to produce uh 1.2 million in other words in our church if each person today can bring 1.2 2 million, [Music] not everybody. Only 100. But we can be able to pay all the 120. So everyone's eyes open. It doesn't have to be a few that are carrying the burden. We can set the goal. Others are able to give 10 million, others five, others three, others two, others one, others 10,000. But on average, if we can count that, everybody, you know, contributes 1.2 million. [Music] and and um you know we keep giving within our weekly um weekly giving in our groups but you make a pledge um to give 100 uh 1.2 million within six months or within 8 months or 10 months whatever it is then we shall attain our goal. And so currently we are working on the on the on the on the plan for that [Music] and um when I'm back from Zimbabwe we shall be able to sit down as a church and and announce to you and discuss with you and see what exactly how we can operationalize that and make it work. But I want to encourage you as a church. We are more than able together. We are more than able. So we already have an agreement and the land is potentially ours. Is ours is ours. And I will tell you this, if we if we now pay extra 10 million, we will even get the first land title. He actually agreed to that &gt;&gt; and I felt that was also another wonderful thing because that that is that would be part payment of of the land because it is 22 240 I mean 220 rather I said 240 but it's 220. So that means each plot is 110. How many understand that? Yeah. So, um we will talk more about this. But for now, I just want to encourage you to double up in what you've been giving. Brother said now it will even be better now that we what we are paying. We we can see and and even they said, "Well, you can even use your land as far as um farming and if you want to grow some crops there or whatever." Well, then I said about farming, we don't want to farm because our faith may reduce. You may think that we will not get the money very soon. We are more than able to take that land. I want to speak like Joshua and Khalif. We are more than able. Tell your neighbor, we are more than able. Amen. Hallelujah. Already what has been done is a miracle. Four years, just a couple young people. It's it's it's it's a miracle. is a miracle and um we certainly thank God for that. So can we stand up on our feet and try to get into the word happy to see one of the elders brother Steven with us tonight. Bless you brother Steven. We always appreciate you. Um we're going to Colossians. chapter 2 &gt;&gt; and I'll ask you to u pray with me first. We are also going to preach to evening light so I'll introduce that afterwards. Let's let's pray. &gt;&gt; Father Lord we we've we've talked about the plan we have for the uh for our land. &gt;&gt; Lord these are are things that are done by faith. If we were to do it according to what we see, we would not see any possibility. But Lord, it's more than what we see. It is what you have promised. For Lord, you did not promise that we will um you know live like poor people or live like low down people. But you promise that we shall be heads and not tails. We will build and inhabit. And Lord, all the good and perfect gifts come from God. It's our desire to have a place of worship, &gt;&gt; a place where um the mothers can be able to have a a a suitable place for their children, babies and and Lord, a a place where we can u we can call a holy sanctuary and and and go there to worship you in spirit and in fruit. And Lord, a place which we can call our own. Father, I remember when Abraham went to buy a piece of land where he would uh bury his wife and the rest of the people. And the people wanted to give it to him for free. He said, "I will not I will not take it for free. I will pay to the last dime." because he knew that no one can share your glory and that you had promised that you would bless him and that you would multiply his seed and that his seed would possess the gate of his enemies. And Lord, he knew who he was. And he knew that you were uh you were the owner of a of over of a thousand cattle on a hill. And father, you blessed his heart and he was able to purchase that piece of land right in Marapella, Lord. And father, Lord, I know that you bless a man according to his revelation. We ask your grace Lord and according to what you have revealed to us. May you bless the people financially as they give to you Lord that you will also uplift their own financial life that they will continue to support their families that as we wait for your coming Lord we will also live like sons of God right here. Not live sorry but live contented and happy. because of what you promised to us. &gt;&gt; Father, I commit the congregation into your hands. The people that are going to listen to me preach tonight. Lord, may you help me. Take me out of the way. I have nothing good to say. I just ask you to help me Lord. And father, help my brother who is interpreting and help everybody to receive. Give us a good atmosphere, Lord. Father, we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So tonight, I would like also to send our greetings to to evening light tabernacle tabernacle. We are streaming as well on Zoom and uh we send our greetings from uh here at DV. So I've been you know dealing with a series of uh of of sermons and I don't know whether to call it a series of sermons but I've been deal dealing with a a series of this subject of our true origin different inspirations and today we are talking about God having preeminence in his bride part four looks like I've not been able to bring that to an end. &gt;&gt; So let's see what the Lord will have for us tonight. So we are reading out of Colossians chapter 2 [Music] and uh we will read a few verses out of that if you are there. Let us read together. Beware, lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power. Amen. You may be seated. God bless you. May May the Holy Spirit help us tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So um we we have talked about Colossians chapter 2 8 quite extensively. And tonight I'd like us to continue a little bit. Let be aware lest any man spoil you through philosophy. And we've talked about philosophy. We've talked about vain deceit, tradition of men, rudiments of the world. And you see all these things combined together. We saw that it is actually the beginning or the uh the um the root cause of of uh cults coming into formation. And we talked about cults and I told and I showed I tried to show you that you know cults are are groups of people that pay their allegiance to a man you know more than anything. If the man said it then it is true. And uh we also found out that uh uh I I tried to give you a definition of uh what a cult is and I showed you that it can also signify intense devotion to a person. Giving themselves to a either a person or an idea. So it doesn't have only to be religious. It can even be political. It can even be social. It can be you know a cult is not only only exclusive to religion. It is just a group of people that have intense devotion to something, a person, an idea, a lifestyle and and you know instead of Christ And you know the Bible says also that they worship the creature more than the creator. &gt;&gt; And I showed you and I've been trying to show you that you see these will believe it as long as their man said it. All their heart, their mind, their everything is towards that man. If you speak about that man then you are in danger with them. Then they will exclude you. Then they will feel bad about you. Then they will dysfellowship you. They will excommunicate you because they feel you are not a part of their set of belief system. And I try to show you also that a cult is very close to what a denomination is. Because you see, a denomination is a group of people that organize under a set of beliefs. [Music] And that's what philosophy means. Philosophy means a set of beliefs a creed. You know, they will tell you that we believe A B C D E F G full stop. So if you dare say anything that is out of what they believe even if it is in the Bible they will push you away they will excommunicate you and that's what every denomination is and that's why brother Bham preached a message and he titled it why are we not a denomination [Music] and and this is what I'm trying to show you that indeed the message came to put await or to divorce the bride away from denominations because denominations were giving us over to the rulership of a man or to a a rulership of of of of a a belief system and and or or to a you know a allegiance to a a society or an organization or even or even a person you know and we even today even here in camp we have many cults potentially a denomination is a cult I will tell you that for sure because if you see the definition of a cult and a definition of a denomination it is almost the same you see you will tell them where do you get your authority to say what you They'll tell you, "Well, our our religion says so." Today, if you go on the road and and take a microphone and begin to preach the things that are in the Bible, you preach against Trinity, you preach against women preachers. You preach against, you know, the systems of man. Then you talk against speaking in tongues without interpretation, you know, and you talk about all these things that are actually being done in our churches or denominational churches today. People will close their ears. Others can even be offended at you. I've actually seen some videos online where when a preacher went out to preach, people came and slapped him or others called police officers to come and arrest them simply because they were offending their religions. They were offending their cults. They have offending their denomination. But you see this message of the hour, it came to show us our true origin. Now when we know our true origin, we will know we are set loose. We are cut loose from any denominational system. They will tell you when you leave our church, you are lost. They will tell you when you leave our denomination, you are going to hell. And that's what happened in the dark ages. That's even what happened during the days of of Luther and Whizzley. We see what did they what did the Roman Catholic Church do? They would take these people simply because you know what what would be their offense because they try to read scripture or to interpret scripture into the common language. [Music] They will take literally take these people and then they burn them with fire after claiming that they have removed them from the grace of going to heaven and they're saying they are going to hell and that the church will help them to send them quicker by burning them with fire. One of the people they burnt was a man who helped us to have this Bible today and his name is is William Tinddale. He was burnt at the stake because he translated the scriptures into the common language of the people there called English. And you know they had their own translations of scriptures into the Latin and and and that was completely a mess. Their translation was not right. It was, you know, not correct actually, but they wanted the people to be to read those incorrect translations. They they were trying to suppress the people. The Bible called it in in the beginning a deed of the Nicolant and then later on he called it the doctrine of the Nicolant. And a prophet told us what it is. He said the doctrine of the nicolant is where a certain group of a few elders or a few so-called bishops or pastors or teachers where they physically assert authority over the entire congregation where you have a holy priesthood that is the the clergy and then you have the lady the people and the people have no say because the spirit works through the leaders, the spirit works through the the bishops and the pastors. And that was brother Banham called it the doctrine of the Nicolante where you cannot claim that you have heard from God but they will tell you God how what did God find you? How did he begin to speak to you? You are not ordained as a priest. To them, God only spoke to an ordained person. And that is philosophy. That is vain deceit. That is tradition of men. That's rudiments of the world. And in every age in every generation, God raised a standard higher than what the devil was doing. And the standard the the Lord raised was to send a man in every generation with a revelation of the true word of God. And that true word of God in every generation liberated the people and set them free from the clause of religion, from the clause of denominationalism, from the from the tradition of men, from philosophy, from vain deceit. And we've talked about many traditions even in this message that people are trying to carry around. But I want to tell to show you and I have already showed you many times that the Lord has set us free from everything that that is to do with traditions of men. And what this message is all about. This message is about Christ. It's all about Christ. Praise the name of the Lord. And even where you find men trying to glue or point us to a man is a shame. Men claiming to believe this message. But then they would say their only their job is to point men to brother Brham. This messenger did not come to point us to brother Brham. This message is not about brother Brham. Brother, &gt;&gt; this message is about Christ. Brother Brham was a carrier of the message. He was only a preacher. He was only a messenger. And he said, "I preach what Paul preached." And what what did Paul preach? Paul preached Christ. 1 Corinthians 3:10. according to the grace of God which is given unto me. Paul said as a wise master builder, I have laid a foundation. I have laid a foundation and another build there on. But let every man take heed how he buildth there upon. For other foundation can no man lay than that that is laid. And then he said, "What is the foundation?" Jesus Christ. Amen. So it's all about Christ. And and brother Bam said, "I preach what Paul preached." So which means what brother Bam preached was not amen about him. It was not about him. I said it was not about him. It was about Christ. The one that died for us. the one that gave his life for us. If there is anything in this world that has tried to remove people from denationalism and cult is the message of God, &gt;&gt; but the ones in the cult, the ones in the denominations, they will not believe it and they will actually call you cult. And even they did to Paul. And Paul said the way they call heresy. Amen. The word they call heresy. &gt;&gt; Yes. I worship the God of my fathers. The word they call a clown. I worship the God of my fathers. For other foundation can no man lay than that which is already laid. And that is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And by the banham said here in the regime of ages, I sincerely believe that the spirit of God has been speaking to us. And listen very carefully because this is a defining moment of brother Banam's message. Not only teaching us the truths of the ages, but he has been faithfully dealing with hearts that they may turn to him. That is the reason for all preaching. That is the reason for all teaching. For it is it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of God and follow him. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. And even today there is preaching and teaching of the word. Because what Jesus did then he will do today he will do forever. And he says not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that I that they may follow me or join my church. Are you hearing now? I want you to understand what brother Bham is saying. He's giving a disclaimer. He said, "I do not bring a message that people may follow me." So if you're following Brother Brham, that's not the reason why he brought the message. Are you following what I'm saying? This message is not so that we may follow. Brother Baron And then he says, I did not even bring it that you may join my church. So if you join the church of brother Brham, that doesn't mean you have received the message. That is not even his purpose. [Music] That's why I believe that's why they named his church tabernacle because he never intended to start a denomination. Trust me, if his church was called something like Capstone Church or Capstone Tabernacle or something, all of us would be named after them and it would be a big denomination all over the world. But who wants to name his church? Because we know better. That was a place where he was preaching. So that's why they named it that God. You know that church was called Apostolic Pentecostal Tabernacle at first &gt;&gt; but they had to change it. God makes no mistakes because he didn't want to start a denomination. [Music] And again he says, "Oh, start some fellowship and organization. So there is no organization that you can tell me we all believers need to be a part of. There is a reason why we have no umbrella. There is a reason friends and let me also say this. It is impossible to have one. It is impossible to have one. You can try it. It cannot work. Why? Simply because the way the message is, the way God package the message, it came in such a way it is impossible to be denominated. When brother Bam had preached for like 30 years, he said is now 30 years you know the message going forward. But we have not formed any denomination. We have not formed an organization. It's now more than 50 years. It's not formed a denomination because this message did not come for a group of people. This message came for individuals. And these individuals are scattered all over the world. in small groups here in big groups there you know some a few handful hundred a thousand tens of thousand but I can tell you they are scattered all over the world. Amen. And he says I have never done that and I will not do that now. I have no interest in those things. But I do have an interest in the things of God and people. He said his interest was in the things of God and people. The things of God is the word of God. We will see it. And if I can accomplish just one thing, I will be satisfied. Now I want us to see what was that one thing that our prophet desired to accomplish that would satisfy him that would make him feel like I have accomplished my purpose. She said that one thing is to see established a true relationship between God and man, between God and man. You cannot do that without pointing people to Christ because it was only Christ that was able to die, that was able to aim and resurrect again. And he was the one who brided the gap between sin and death wherein men become new creations in Christ. Amen. He says, "I want to see that relationship." How many believers today have a relationship between God and themselves? How many? Very many don't. And it is so sad. Many think they have to believe a set of rules or doctrines and they have tried to make this message a set of rules. Oh, can I preach to you this evening? The message is more than rules. The message is more than doctrines. It is more than teachings of God. It is a revelation. Because the church of Jesus Christ is built upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Jesus Christ wants to have the preeminence in his church. &gt;&gt; And then he says, I will be satisfied if they can have a relationship between God and men wherein men become new creations in Christ. filled with the with his spirit and living according to his word. Many think being filled with the Holy Spirit is a mere revelation with no manifestation. But if time allows, we're going to we are going to try to talk about that. He says, "I want to see men filled with the spirit and men living according to his word. And I would invite and bleed and want all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him." So it's all about Christ. And then he finishes up by saying, "God bless you and may his coming rejoice your heart. It's all about him who is coming. It's all about Christ." Oh my my my my. Help me preach to you this evening. It's not about brother Brana. It's not about Tabernacle. It's not about any association or organization. It's about the word. It's about Christ. him having the preeminence in your life. You having a relationship with him, having a personal walk with him. [Music] Colossians 1:26. He says, "Even the mystery which has been hid from all from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glor of of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. which is Christ in you. And brother Bham said that's my purpose. Do you realize that brother Bham came as a seventh angel messenger to finish that mystery to oh my good Lord to finish that mystery. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh angel. And then here he said, "I plead and I want all to hear his voice at this time in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. When he begins to sound, the mystery of God will be finished. given the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now he's made manifest to his saints. Not to everybody, not to everybody, not to denomination, not to religion, not to cult, to the saints. The saints are the redeemed of the Lord. Amen. They that have been born again, born of the world. Amen. And he says to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ. Can you see it church? This is not about our little little church names. You find people so clouded in their church names selling the brand of their church. Listen, we are not here to sell church name brand. Our church name brand has nothing to do with it. If we love our church name so much, Then we are like the rest of the denominations. You find people so obsessed with who their pastor is. People are so obsessed with what they have accomplished as a church or now we have a church building or now we have 500 following us 1,000 20,000. And brother Bam said that's what the denominations were doing. They were so busting because they had the numbers. But let me tell you brother, sister, the move we are in is higher than that. We are no longer looking or seeking for numbers. We are no longer looking or seeking for our church name. For knowing who our pastor is and all that is good, but rather we are looking for one thing. That Christ may be seen. That Christ may be magnified. that Christ may be glorified in your life as an individual. If he is not glorified, if he's not seen, you will not go in the rapture. [Music] He says, "Then whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ, Amen. Where I also labor striving according to his working which workketh in me mighty. Amen. If you're a minister, it's not about you. It's about the working of Christ in you. Amen. If you're preaching, let them see Christ. If you're singing, let them see Christ. If you're playing an instrument, oh, let it be about Christ. Glory to God. It's not about you. &gt;&gt; It's all about him. Amen. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. A prophet says God has had a three-fold purpose. A three-fold purpose. In this great mystery secret, God in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began, he has got a threefold purpose in it. Oh, glory to God. This mystery secret was a secret. will be a secret will remain a secret until the days of the voice of the seventh angel. When he begins to sound, then this mystery secret will be unveiled will be opened. And then here he says it has a three-fold purpose in it. God had this mystery secret before the world began. And now what have we it says what we want to go upon this morning is what is that three-fold purpose. Now I believe by the help of the God who is present he will show you to us. Now if he had this three-fold purpose we want to find out what is this three-fold purpose. The first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people. [Music] Are you following me now? I'm I'm giving you bride food. This is bride material. This is not for chicken. This is for eag. Are you an eagle tonight? Amen. And God wanted to reveal himself to the people in this first mystery, first phase, first purpose. He couldn't do it as a great Jehovah, who covered all space, who covered all time, who covered all eternity. He could not do it. He is too great to be revealed to the people. because it would be too mysterious. God in this great mystery secret which was hid through ages which was hid through generations. He wanted to reveal himself to his people. But then he says he could not do it as the eternal God that covered all space and time and eternity. He was too great to do that. Oh, if he did it, it would have been too mysterious for us to understand. So how could that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond a cycle of hundreds and billions and trillions and trillions of years of light of space and onto out into the infinite into the eternity and a great scripture that was all that and still is. Can you describe that? He's just describing the greatness of God. He was there. He went beyond hundreds and billions and trillions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and on out into the infinite into the eternity. Oh, what a great creature. Oh. But what he wanted to do, he loved fatherhood. He want he was a father. And the only way that he could express it was to become a son, &gt;&gt; a man. Oh my. Glory to God. God, the infinite God, the great eternal God. Amen. He wanted to express himself as a father. But then he says he couldn't do that. He had to express himself as a son, &gt;&gt; as a man. That's the reason Jesus kept saying, the son of man. See, they didn't know what he was talking about. Many of them them that are following philosophy, them that are following vain sick, them that are following tradition of men, they did not know many of them. But now, do you get it? He wanted to express himself. That was his one of his great threefold purposes. He was to express himself to identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in oh my don't miss this. He wanted to reveal himself in Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you following now? God, that great eternal God. He wanted to reveal himself in Christ. That's why the Bible says Jesus was born. &gt;&gt; The Christ my children are born. You are born. Some of you are born the Are you following me now? But there was one that was born. See Christ [Applause] is a mystery of God revealed. You know he was revealing God himself tabernacle in man. Oh my my they did not understand that. They didn't understand that. So when Peter stands up on the day of Pentecost and he says, "Let this be known unto you that uh the Jesus &gt;&gt; whom you have crucified God has made him both Lord and Christ." They didn't understand what he meant. They didn't understand he was meaning he was the revelation of the very God that created heaven and earth. Christ was a real revelation of the godhead. Amen. And that was his first forward purpose. And his second for purpose, this is the most exciting one for me is to have the preeminence. Now I'm arriving finally at our subject to have the preeminence in his body of believers. That is his bride that he might live in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wanted to live in us. This mystery I'm talking about. It is to reveal the glory. It is to manifest the power and the glory of God. He himself wanted to come down and have preeminence. Not in a holy priesthood in a people. &gt;&gt; In a people, &gt;&gt; you and me, he might live in his people. Now he could do that in he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them. When we talk about our true origin I am not actually talking about Genesis 2 because right now we are the man of Genesis 3. We are the fallen man. In Genesis 3, we are the fallen man, right? That's true. We are not in his image anymore. That's why we need to be restored back again. We need to be redeemed back again. In Genesis chapter 2, it was a manifested man into a body of flesh. Because in Genesis 2, you find the man Adam and the woman who was a part of the man. Because literally the word woman means a part of a man. But in Genesis 3, the man you see there is Adam, the man and Eve, mother of all living and and and brother Bham then talks about the hybriding and he talks about her as the greatest or she's or this kind of woman the greatest biggest hybrid. [Music] Hybrid. Yes, &gt;&gt; it is not in the purpose of God for for for hybriding the seed. But we see in Genesis 3, there is a hybrid that actually took place. The Bible says that so is is a way of an adulterous woman. She eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I've done no evil." We we know what the evil was. It was adultery. She ate from two seeds. She received of two seeds. She received of the seed of Adam, the son of God in the image of God, and then received from the serpent. And so then it it brought forth in her womb two different kind of seeds. This was a hybrid. It was not in the in the purpose in the plan of God. And we are all born like that. That's why the Bible says all of us have are born short of the glory. We come short of the glory. We cannot be in that image. We cannot be in that glory. Therefore, we our eyes of understanding a void to the mystery of God. Because the mystery of God, the twofold purpose, the second fault purpose of it, the second fold purpose of it is that God must be revealed or manifested or must have preeminence in his people. Genesis 3, man has lost the preeminence. Man has lost his identity. Genesis 2, that's when it happened when when when man who was spoken into existence and molded through out of the earth. Then we find that the devil took advantage of that. They were not in they had not known no sin. They were perfect as far as sinning is concerned. But the devil found them in that body. So when we talk about our true origin, I am not talking about that body. I'm talking about Genesis 1. Hallelujah. In Genesis 1, there is nowhere the devil could get man. He was he was in Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; He was a part of him. Let there be man in our image. And so God created man in his own image. Even the mystery which was praise the name of the Lord which was from ages and from generations but now it is made manifest with saints. Amen. And then he continues and he says which is Christ in you the hope of glory. So we have now at this level returned to the glory which we had with God in Christ. [Music] You see, it's a process. Praise the name of the Lord. There's one that is happening now being positionally blessed in our rightful place in Christ. Amen. In the right positions and authority in Christ, in heavenly places in Christ, all those things happen in Christ. But then there's a second one that actually will now happen as our bodies are being translated. That is the final act of adoption that we are now waiting for. Praise the name of the Lord. Now let's continue here a little bit. And then he says, "But sin separated them." So now there had to be some way to get it back again. This is rich to me just to even think of it. So what God's purpose was now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that then he would never be able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could have been a father there. That's true. But also he's a savior. You say how do you know he was He is because I've had the experience. &gt;&gt; How many can How many know tonight God is a savior? &gt;&gt; Amen. How do you know he is? Well, I know because I've had experience he is a savior and he had to express that. And how could he do it? Only through Christ. How could he be a son? Only through Christ. &gt;&gt; Come on now, church. How could he be a healer? Only through Christ. All things are wound up in that one person, Jesus Christ. When I think of it, he say, I just see denominations pass off a sin. My my my my you missed that one. When you see the clear picture, you see denominations disappearing. Brother Dixon, you seeominations disappearing. When you understand this is all about Christ and his brain no longer see any church things disappear then you begin seeing Christ. How could he be a healer? only through Christ. So now you are no longer going to see the great anointed man of God. How could he be a savior? Only through Christ. You no longer see your pastor as the only divine savior. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Oh my. Don't you love this? Everything is wound up in him. all denominations pass of the scene and everything else just going see when I see God's great purpose revealing himself and having first revealed himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead body and then to bring that fullness of godhead bodly into a And then he could have the preeminences [Music] meaning the oversight meaning the leading preeminence means the officer. over the overseer. In other words, we have seen so many pastors who want to call themselves overseers. The Bible calls Christ the bishop of our soul. He's a great big overseer. He's the lead one leading. Oh, if a church is led by Christ, the pastor is led by Christ, the brothers and sisters are led by Christ, we are not going to have any problem. We will stop looking at each other. Your brother will offend you. You will still love him because Christ is leading you. So and so will do something to you. You will still forgive them because Christ is leading you. But why do we have hatred among brothers? Hatred among sisters, among families, among churches, camps here, camps there, camps here, camps there, competition here, competition there. Why? Because there is no Christ in these people's hearts. The Bible said with their mouth they worship me, but they were with their works. They don't listen. This is the denomination. This is the generation we're living in. And now this message is calling us back to go back to Christ. [Applause] If you have Christ in your heart, you will love your enemy. And let me put it this way. You will have no enemy. Pastor, do you mean it literally? Yes. Can I announce something to you? I personally have no enemy in this world. If they told you they were my enemy, then they need help. I love them. Guess what? When he was on earth, he had no enemy. He loved everybody. It makes me love everybody. Makes me love everybody. Makes me love everybody. Is good enough to people bad brother. I agree with you. People are bad. So bad. You help somebody and they will go and kill you behind your back. That's right. That's what people are. But that's why Christ came. That's why Christ came. He came that they may have life and have it more abundantly. If Christ is in your heart, you will have no out against anybody. You'll have no bad heart. You will be forgiving. You will love everybody even when they do bad to you. You will still love and pray for them. I challenge you to love everybody. I challenge you to forgive everybody. I challenge you to have a good heart, a good spirit so that they may say you are his disciple if they see that you have love for one another. But be not as Cain who hated his brother and he killed him. He loved him not. He could not love because God is love. Don't be disheartened. That's why Christ came. Let Christ be expressed through you. Let's do a recap here now. First he came to express himself completely God in Christ. Second to have preeminences by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them. Oh help me express yourself through me. And thirdly, to restore the kingdom to its rightful position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked into the cool of the evening which his people talked with them, fellowshipped with them. And he goes ahead to talk about God becoming. I can as well say you are God becoming. God has become you. God has manifested himself. He says when Eve went away from the word, she went away from Hammet. And when the church goes away from the word to her denomination, she rejects and commits fornications with the world of man's wisdom, rejecting the authority of God's word. The Bible said committing spiritual fornications any word in the Bible that's rejected or if any self interpretation put to it is absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the God that is in your that is your husband and anulterist never enters the kingdom of heaven. And you know the three the third food phase of this is that he may restore the kingdom. [Music] That's what Eve done in the first place. So you see now you know we're going to have a kingdom. We're going to live in that kingdom in reality. In reality. Now notice again now watch this three-fold purpose. manifest manifest himself in Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to come into the body of Jesus by Jesus Christ to have the preeminences to what to restore back Eden bring back that which was lost. That was the only thing out of order. All the rest of his things was in order. Another prophet said he only has interest in the things of God. And the only thing that is out of order is what happened in Eden. Must Eden must be restored. The domain of God on earth through the man must be restored. But he had to let he had to put on free moral agency to fall so that he might be a savior to display what is in him. His attribute of savior something had to be lost. And the very thing that man fail and become lost, he become the savior of that taking his own law. And he could not do it as the great Jehovah that covered all space and time. He had to become a man and he took kinship with a man that was lost. He became kinship. Uganda. &gt;&gt; Yes. And became a man. God made flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my something inside brother says God became from God. God became from God to become me. to take my sin upon him &gt;&gt; that he might make me him. &gt;&gt; Okay, are you listening now? Ask your neighbor, are you listening? Listen. God became from God to become me to take my sin upon him that he might make me him. Amen. Back to his great purpose of sons and daughters of God. Amen. That attribute was in him. It had to be displayed. God became hallelujah. Me that I might become him. We are restored back again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give him a clap of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I finish with this. It says it's a revelation. It's an eternal. It's as eternal as God's word is eternal. But a three-fold purpose of God is great mystery. This is an announcement. The three-fold purpose of this God is great mystery [Music] is revealed. Who is announcing this? The prophet of Malachi 4, the prophet of Revelation 10:7 because when it sounds the mystery will be finished. &gt;&gt; And now he says it is revealed. God manifested in Christ. Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the lost Eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden. [Music] That's all. That's the mystery of Christ revealed. Hallelujah. So you have a part to it. It is all about you. When I say it's all about you, I mean Christ in you. Do you love him? Let us stand on our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. &gt;&gt; Precious Jesus. &gt;&gt; Bless your people now. Lord, perhaps some who want you to reveal these things further to them. Lord, open their eyes of understanding. Reveal yourself to them. Open the word to them and may they know you in the power of your resurrection. Thank you Jesus for your love. Thank you for what you have done for us in this house. Bless every brother and sister and those on Zoom Lord in their homes father. I pray that you bless them and open this revelation to them. Bless each of us who are here Lord.
