[1:16:56] you know when when the Elder is in the
[1:17:01] camp all the children are always
[1:17:05] happy
[1:17:08] amen uh this precious
[1:17:12] message uh came in Uganda in the early
[1:17:19] 80s and uh there's been men of God who
[1:17:22] have held this message
[1:17:26] very many of them we cannot enumerate
[1:17:28] all of
[1:17:30] them that God has used over the
[1:17:35] years but there's been different
[1:17:39] Generations there is the first fast
[1:17:42] Generations uh We've hosted people like
[1:17:45] Pastor I
[1:17:47] here where are part of that first
[1:17:52] generation of the people that go got
[1:17:55] this message and started spreading
[1:17:58] it and God used them
[1:18:01] mightly Pastor
[1:18:04] Gideon I if I'm wrong he will correct me
[1:18:07] I think he's from the second
[1:18:12] generation uh after the first then came
[1:18:15] from the
[1:18:19] second brother sh can you please correct
[1:18:21] the error the the echo so he uh comes
[1:18:25] from the second
[1:18:27] generation uh of the
[1:18:30] ministers and uh we come from maybe the
[1:18:33] third or the fourth I don't
[1:18:36] know but I think we come after his
[1:18:41] generation so to
[1:18:43] us he's an
[1:18:45] elder I personally did not come directly
[1:18:49] to the message through his
[1:18:53] ministry but by proxy have come out of
[1:18:55] his
[1:18:57] ministry because they ministered before
[1:19:01] us I remember there was a time the first
[1:19:04] time I saw brother
[1:19:06] Gideon I was
[1:19:08] inana my my
[1:19:11] pastor used these
[1:19:13] words he said there is a brother
[1:19:17] coming because I was from the Anglican
[1:19:20] church and I was leaving with a bishop
[1:19:25] so he told me there is a brother
[1:19:27] coming if it was like in your
[1:19:31] church he would have been our
[1:19:34] Bishop so I was expectant brother when I
[1:19:37] was when he mentioned that and when he
[1:19:41] came I was
[1:19:43] disappointed the reason why I was
[1:19:46] disappointed he did not have the big
[1:19:50] gown in the angc church they used to
[1:19:53] have big big guns
[1:19:56] the big
[1:19:57] Rings he did not have a big ring he did
[1:20:01] not have a big
[1:20:02] gown but when he started
[1:20:04] preaching I noticed why the my pastor
[1:20:08] had said
[1:20:10] that and so um I was immensely blessed
[1:20:14] at that time I think I was uh had just
[1:20:17] believ the message
[1:20:19] then and so we are so honored this
[1:20:22] morning to have a precious Pastor
[1:20:26] Gideon uh that has come to be with
[1:20:29] us and encourage
[1:20:31] us uh it is a sacrifice on his
[1:20:35] part because as you know he just lost
[1:20:38] his
[1:20:41] associate and actually this week earlier
[1:20:45] he told me he had gone
[1:20:48] to he just arrived late last
[1:20:51] night so I mean you can imagine the
[1:20:53] sacrifice
[1:20:55] and so I want you to put in your
[1:20:59] 100% uh because God has something for us
[1:21:04] this
[1:21:06] morning uh God has used our brother in a
[1:21:09] mighty
[1:21:12] way um I think I I would be justified to
[1:21:16] say it
[1:21:18] publicly that he has the biggest church
[1:21:20] of the message Ina
[1:21:24] and and we know in the message we do not
[1:21:26] really count
[1:21:29] numbers but the reason I said
[1:21:31] that is to look at the
[1:21:34] eort the sacrifice the labors that he
[1:21:38] has put in over the over the
[1:21:41] years and so when he comes just know all
[1:21:46] that labor
[1:21:47] experience
[1:21:49] wisdom anointing you are going to be a
[1:21:52] partaker of
[1:21:54] amen so without wasting more
[1:21:58] time I'll just um ask you to
[1:22:01] stand and uh we sing a little chorus as
[1:22:05] we are preparing ourselves to
[1:22:10] invite
[1:22:12] amen once
[1:22:14] again we are
[1:22:16] honored may God bless you
[1:22:19] so when I came to
[1:22:21] cala the the very first person I met
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:26] met was Pastor
[1:22:28] Gideon and um at that time we were not
[1:22:32] too sure what the Lord wanted us to
[1:22:35] do we want we knew but we were not too
[1:22:40] sure but I know one
[1:22:42] thing that if you want
[1:22:46] access if you want
[1:22:49] access the seed to Ser for that is hor
[1:22:54] and if God has honored a man in a
[1:22:58] city and I want access in the
[1:23:01] city that City then I'm going to honor
[1:23:04] the man that God has given
[1:23:07] us and he encouraged me he said you go
[1:23:10] and
[1:23:11] start we are behind you and I'm so
[1:23:15] honored because of
[1:23:17] that so feel free Pastor Gideon to
[1:23:21] rebuke to teach to
[1:23:25] uh to instruct whichever the holy spirit
[1:23:29] will lead
[1:23:30] you amen I'd like us to sing a little
[1:23:35] chorus you're worthy of
[1:23:38] it and if you can just close your
[1:23:41] eyes and in your heart ask the Lord to
[1:23:43] speak
[1:23:46] to you worth all

[1:27:50] stand that is my wife
[1:27:54] then I came with my daughter
[1:27:57] Grace Grace she's a daughter of my elder
[1:28:02] brother then I came with Quinton qu
[1:28:06] brother Quinton I saw him sing I
[1:28:10] think online
[1:28:13] and and of course I didn't come with
[1:28:18] Becky but I know
[1:28:21] her so I'm happy to find her around
[1:28:26] uh as the pastor has
[1:28:29] mentioned uh from way
[1:28:36] day yeah I I had a trip in Wednesday or
[1:28:41] Thursday Thursday sometimes I get so
[1:28:44] tired even my mind gets so
[1:28:47] tired so exhausted so we went
[1:28:51] to BU
[1:28:55] how many know where
[1:28:58] is it is in Masa some part of mas
[1:29:02] greater
[1:29:04] Massacre so and again we went deep
[1:29:07] inside in the
[1:29:12] remote they PL coffee and bananas in the
[1:29:17] same Plantation so we came back
[1:29:19] yesterday
[1:29:21] night we have been uh was invited by a
[1:29:25] Pentecostal
[1:29:27] Church uh who also invited their some of
[1:29:31] their close
[1:29:35] pastors I introduced to them the
[1:29:38] message one major basic doctrine that I
[1:29:42] had to
[1:29:45] handle was baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:29:50] Christ and it goes with godhead
[1:29:55] and they all excitedly received
[1:30:02] it so uh they want
[1:30:07] more they are very hungry
[1:30:10] people what I learned is that even among
[1:30:16] denominations there are some real
[1:30:18] genuine
[1:30:21] Christians they love God with all their
[1:30:23] heart
[1:30:25] but only they have not made the
[1:30:28] truth that's what I
[1:30:31] realized so uh Pastor Talma thank you
[1:30:36] very
[1:30:37] much for the
[1:30:40] invitation and for those kind words that
[1:30:42] you have spoken about
[1:30:45] me as you introduced
[1:30:48] me thank you very much may the Lord
[1:30:50] bless you so
[1:30:52] much and truly is consistent with his
[1:30:58] words when he came to start a church in
[1:31:02] C he told me he believes that God has
[1:31:05] given me a blessing in this
[1:31:10] city and he needed
[1:31:13] to um honor me and respect me for
[1:31:19] that and he has repeated it here
[1:31:24] and I believe God is sharing the
[1:31:26] blessing with
[1:31:29] him mean to
[1:31:32] him
[1:31:34] uh I can see how uh Dynamic this
[1:31:38] ministry
[1:31:41] is and how it's growing very
[1:31:45] fast you can see already the blessing of
[1:31:47] the
[1:31:48] Lord upon this
[1:31:51] ministry and I believe
[1:31:54] it's growing into Great
[1:31:58] Heights well we were friends
[1:32:03] before even before he started
[1:32:06] here even when he was ministering in
[1:32:10] Ethiopia I think I'm one of the very few
[1:32:13] Elders that invited to to preach there
[1:32:17] to preach in his church in
[1:32:22] Ethiopia that is before he relocated
[1:32:25] back
[1:32:26] here his wife is my
[1:32:30] daughter yeah she's she's in that
[1:32:33] category I have a number of
[1:32:36] daughters I have a number of
[1:32:39] daughters
[1:32:41] Believers and she's one of
[1:32:43] them just like
[1:32:46] Becky so uh I'm just at
[1:32:51] home this is my church
[1:32:56] amen uh as he mentioned that uh I I rank
[1:33:02] in the second Elder
[1:33:08] generation I believe it is
[1:33:11] true uh either second or
[1:33:16] third
[1:33:18] amen yes but the Lord has given me
[1:33:21] Grace and I've been serving
[1:33:25] him and we have
[1:33:28] done a few things here and
[1:33:32] there and by the grace of
[1:33:35] God we have influenced the
[1:33:40] nation with the
[1:33:42] gospel yesterday as I was preaching
[1:33:45] among those P Pentecostal
[1:33:49] people I was shocked to find a number
[1:33:52] some of them already
[1:33:54] had heard about my
[1:33:58] Ministry one of the pastors told me he
[1:34:00] was following my preaching on
[1:34:03] radio even before he accepted Jesus
[1:34:05] Christ as Lord
[1:34:09] and and one of the young people actually
[1:34:12] the pastor uh the pastor
[1:34:16] son who was who was in the doing the
[1:34:21] instruments he told me I I've I've been
[1:34:24] watch I have some clips of
[1:34:28] yours yeah on
[1:34:30] YouTube I've been following
[1:34:33] you so I realized the grace of
[1:34:37] God so uh by the grace of
[1:34:42] God uh we have put some little uh
[1:34:48] contribution uh to
[1:34:51] this nation
[1:34:54] influencing it with a
[1:34:57] message I'm saying little
[1:35:01] because there is a lot that
[1:35:04] is
[1:35:07] undone there are many who have not even
[1:35:09] heard about this
[1:35:12] place we pray for the grace of God to
[1:35:16] us and for the generation for you
[1:35:20] people to come and take over
[1:35:32] for
[1:35:34] amen as the put
[1:35:37] it you learned of the tragedy that befil
[1:35:42] us losing the my assistant
[1:35:48] pastor he was more than
[1:35:51] that we started the ministry history
[1:35:55] together and we moved
[1:35:57] together a very composed solid
[1:36:04] man in character and in the knowledge of
[1:36:07] the
[1:36:08] word and but the Lord took him
[1:36:12] home but God does no
[1:36:15] mistakes he knows the why he had to go
[1:36:18] at this
[1:36:21] time I remember that time I put on my
[1:36:25] status
[1:36:27] WhatsApp that he has left me when I
[1:36:30] needed him
[1:36:34] most but that is a human
[1:36:37] being God knows why he had to
[1:36:40] go so that is just the other
[1:36:44] week so my church still is in the
[1:36:47] process
[1:36:48] of mourning
[1:36:51] and and healing
[1:36:56] yes last Sunday I was to be
[1:36:59] here but that was
[1:37:02] crazy because that's the same week we
[1:37:05] buried him we bu him on
[1:37:08] Monday on Sunday it was a funeral
[1:37:12] service on Monday we bued him the
[1:37:16] following Sunday not being with a
[1:37:19] church it was
[1:37:22] bad it would look as if it will look
[1:37:26] bad but more than that I had a vis who
[1:37:31] came to comfort us a pastor who had come
[1:37:35] all the way from
[1:37:36] Kenya and I could not leave him
[1:37:39] alone and in that condition that
[1:37:42] atmosph so I I realized even very
[1:37:47] late had already advertised that I was
[1:37:50] going to be here
[1:37:53] I called him and I apologized I really I
[1:37:57] really took time
[1:37:59] apologizing and I thank God he
[1:38:01] understood
[1:38:02] me and he granted me the
[1:38:07] permission and I asked him to ask you
[1:38:10] for
[1:38:12] apology which I believe he
[1:38:14] did so thank you very much for
[1:38:18] understanding and
[1:38:20] accommodating uh me in that aspect
[1:38:26] amen so even now after this
[1:38:30] service I run very
[1:38:33] fast
[1:38:36] Sister Sister Rebecca I'm sorry I will
[1:38:39] not be able to to stay behind to have
[1:38:43] some lunch
[1:38:47] around because of that
[1:38:50] reason I feel that church there needs uh
[1:38:55] comforting
[1:38:57] comforting amen do you love
[1:39:02] God
[1:39:04] Amen God bless you
[1:39:07] all uh you can stand now for the reading
[1:39:10] of the
[1:39:12] word I'm not going to speak uh for long
[1:39:15] I
[1:39:18] believe and I'm going to speak something
[1:39:20] very simple
[1:39:24] yes a simple sermon from a tired
[1:39:28] man and I pray you'll bear with
[1:39:32] me let us read from the book of second
[1:39:35] Timothy
[1:39:41] 2:3 you are there already thank you for
[1:39:43] being that quick amen thou therefore
[1:39:46] endure hardness hardness as a good
[1:39:50] soldier of Jesus Christ
[1:39:58] no man that worth entangleth himself
[1:40:01] with the Affairs of this life that he
[1:40:04] may please him who has chosen him to be
[1:40:07] a
[1:40:16] soldier catch the word entanglement
[1:40:25] and then we can also read Galatians 5
[1:40:31] verse1 to
[1:40:38] S stand first therefore in the Liberty
[1:40:42] wherein Christ has made us free and be
[1:40:45] not entangled again with a yoke of
[1:40:48] bondage behold I po say unto you that if
[1:40:52] he be circumcised Christ shall profit
[1:40:54] you nothing for I testify again to every
[1:40:57] man that is circumcised that he is a
[1:41:00] data to do the whole law Christ is
[1:41:04] become of no effect unto you whosoever
[1:41:08] of you are justified by the law ye are
[1:41:11] fallen from grace for we through the
[1:41:15] spirit wait for the hope of
[1:41:17] righteousness by faith for in Jesus
[1:41:21] Christ neither circumcision
[1:41:24] neither circumcision ath anything nor
[1:41:27] uncircumcision but Faith which
[1:41:31] worketh by love ye did run well who did
[1:41:35] hinder you that you should not obey the
[1:41:52] truth for
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:41] may the Lord add blessing to the to the
[1:42:42] reading of his word we may be
[1:42:46] SE I want to take a
[1:42:51] subject that I'll call him
[1:42:56] hindrances
[1:42:58] yeah
[1:43:01] hindrances things which
[1:43:05] hinder I think that's what they call
[1:43:08] it something
[1:43:11] like I preach this sermon in and that's
[1:43:14] how they were putting
[1:43:18] it
[1:43:20] amen I will introduce it with a few
[1:43:23] quotes
[1:43:26] here he said you'll be given two
[1:43:37] signs he said you will be given two
[1:43:42] sides as was the prophet
[1:43:45] Moses he said one side will be that you
[1:43:49] will detect diseases through your hand
[1:43:55] when the people contact
[1:43:58] you well you'll be able to tell them
[1:44:01] what disease they have through a
[1:44:03] supernatural
[1:44:09] discernment and then said if you'll be
[1:44:13] sincere then it will come to pass that
[1:44:15] you will tell the people the secret the
[1:44:18] secrets of their hearts
[1:44:23] and the things that they've done in life
[1:44:26] that might have hindered their healing
[1:44:29] and so
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:34] forth look at that word hindered their
[1:44:39] healing now who was speaking
[1:44:41] this I believe many of you
[1:44:45] know
[1:44:47] but we have a lot of new
[1:44:50] people who may not know all the details
[1:44:54] and the history of the
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:44:58] message so this is the Angel of the
[1:45:02] Lord when when he met brother
[1:45:05] Bram in the
[1:45:07] cave to give him a
[1:45:10] commission to take the ministry of
[1:45:12] Divine
[1:45:13] [Applause]
[1:45:14] Healing around the
[1:45:17] world this angel had been speaking to
[1:45:21] him from
[1:45:24] childhood from when he was 3 years
[1:45:28] old
[1:45:29] amen h i don't I will not go into
[1:45:33] details but he spoke to him again when
[1:45:36] he was
[1:45:37] seven remember when he was seated at a
[1:45:40] popular
[1:45:41] tree and then that wind came and and
[1:45:45] blowing into the
[1:45:49] branches he turned there a voice spoke
[1:45:53] from
[1:45:55] there said never
[1:45:57] drink Never
[1:45:59] Smoke never defile your body in any
[1:46:02] way for when you grow
[1:46:05] older there's a great work for you to
[1:46:08] do he heard the voice very
[1:46:10] well he ran home
[1:46:14] Hally but and mother thought maybe had
[1:46:17] been beaten by a
[1:46:20] snake and but brother for him he knew
[1:46:23] what had
[1:46:24] happened said mother man spoke to
[1:46:27] me in that tree his words were very
[1:46:32] clear he told me this this this
[1:46:35] this he said I will never pass by that
[1:46:38] tree by that tree
[1:46:40] again and the same voice that spoke to
[1:46:44] him the same voice that spoke to him
[1:46:47] when he was 3 years
[1:46:49] old and also now on Ohio River
[1:46:54] when he was baptizing his first
[1:46:57] converts that when he reached the 17th
[1:47:01] person that that great light appeared
[1:47:04] the the pillow fire the
[1:47:08] star in Broad day
[1:47:11] light you see a light that outshines the
[1:47:17] sun is a very strong
[1:47:21] light and then came from
[1:47:24] there as John the
[1:47:27] Baptist was sent for around the first
[1:47:29] coming of Jesus
[1:47:32] Christ your Min for second
[1:47:37] coming but all
[1:47:40] through you know he had met a lot uh of
[1:47:45] uh reactions to that voice and to that
[1:47:48] Supernatural that followed him
[1:47:54] some people told him it was
[1:47:56] Satan some people told him it was
[1:48:00] God and he was wondering if it is
[1:48:03] certain how come it's keeping me from
[1:48:06] doing
[1:48:08] wrong and how come whatever he tells me
[1:48:10] comes to
[1:48:13] pass and the time came I said I want to
[1:48:17] know
[1:48:18] clearly perfectly the purpose of my life
[1:48:23] and then he went to seek God he told his
[1:48:26] wife have this money I'm going to seek
[1:48:30] God I'm seeking an answer from God if he
[1:48:34] does not answer me I will not come back
[1:48:38] you know what how you will decide
[1:48:42] thereafter you was so desperate and
[1:48:46] determined to seek God for that answer
[1:48:49] or not come
[1:48:51] back I think it's good good for us to
[1:48:53] seek God that
[1:48:55] way with such a
[1:48:58] determination and we mean
[1:49:01] business and when he while he was there
[1:49:04] in that
[1:49:06] cave I think he didn't spend there two
[1:49:09] days I think he prayed through the
[1:49:12] day and through the night and toward
[1:49:16] morning he had someone
[1:49:19] walking a very heavy set being
[1:49:24] and he turned to see the
[1:49:26] person and when he turned to see he saw
[1:49:29] that pill of
[1:49:31] fire as we have it you know
[1:49:34] it and then the man
[1:49:37] spoke say fear
[1:49:39] not my angel sent from the presence of
[1:49:42] the
[1:49:43] Lord now he says that was the first
[1:49:48] time for him to see the person of that
[1:49:52] voice
[1:49:55] because before he was hearing the
[1:49:58] voice but I never seen the person but
[1:50:01] when he saw when he had the voice fear
[1:50:05] not that was a familiar
[1:50:07] [Music]
[1:50:09] voice the same voice that I started
[1:50:11] speaking to
[1:50:13] him when he was three and again seven
[1:50:17] and again on a on a high river and now
[1:50:20] he's seeing the very person
[1:50:23] of the
[1:50:25] voice so he the one who spoke to
[1:50:28] him words and
[1:50:32] more but our focus is on these
[1:50:35] words you be given two
[1:50:38] signs as was prophet
[1:50:41] Moses amen you will detect the
[1:50:46] diseases through your right hand it
[1:50:49] would be good to go into details of that
[1:50:51] gift how it operated
[1:50:54] but since since it is not the
[1:50:56] subject and we don't have much time we
[1:51:00] shall not go into and he said then
[1:51:02] you'll be able to tell
[1:51:05] them what
[1:51:07] diseases they have through a
[1:51:08] supernatural
[1:51:11] discernment and if you'll be
[1:51:13] sincere then will come to pass that will
[1:51:17] tell the people the secrets of their
[1:51:20] hearts that is a second sign
[1:51:23] and the things that they have done in
[1:51:27] life that might have hindered their
[1:51:32] healing we are talking about
[1:51:36] hindrances here is healing
[1:51:42] hindered a supernatural gift may be
[1:51:46] there the word will is there promising
[1:51:49] you
[1:51:50] healing and even you have the fa
[1:51:54] the person praying for you has
[1:51:55] Faith but there are some things You'
[1:51:57] have done in
[1:52:00] life that are hinder hindering the
[1:52:06] healing that however much you
[1:52:09] pray how much you can be
[1:52:12] Anointed The Devil feels he has a legal
[1:52:17] right to stay there because there are
[1:52:20] things you have done
[1:52:23] that brought him into your
[1:52:25] life the things you did that opened the
[1:52:32] Fortress because as
[1:52:34] Believers we are living under
[1:52:37] Fortress we are living under
[1:52:39] protection but you can do some
[1:52:42] things and you open that Fortress and
[1:52:45] the devil enters and takes over and when
[1:52:49] he has taken over he feels he has the
[1:52:53] right to stay
[1:52:56] there only
[1:52:59] confession when you
[1:53:01] confess and repent of that thing confess
[1:53:05] that
[1:53:07] wrong under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:53:10] the devil has no any right anym to stay
[1:53:16] there he will
[1:53:18] live so brother BR by the gift of God
[1:53:23] no no matter he was very
[1:53:26] successful in healing he could even
[1:53:30] see why that devil is
[1:53:36] there and why he's not
[1:53:40] leaving and then when he reveals it to
[1:53:45] you the very thing you
[1:53:48] know you know what you did you know when
[1:53:52] you did
[1:53:54] maybe it is it's even haunting
[1:53:56] you but you keep suppressing and
[1:53:59] covering but you know it and it tells
[1:54:03] you what you did you know it is God and
[1:54:07] then as you
[1:54:08] confess and then he prays very easily
[1:54:13] the devil
[1:54:15] lives praise God so hinderance of
[1:54:19] healing
[1:54:23] I'm just backing my
[1:54:28] subject and another quote here did you
[1:54:32] ever see a grain of corn planted in the
[1:54:38] ground and let a stick fall over
[1:54:43] it it will grow
[1:54:48] crooked any Vine anything that grows up
[1:54:54] will because something has hindered
[1:55:03] it it's a good seed perfect
[1:55:06] seed but something is hindering you so
[1:55:10] it grows
[1:55:12] CR something has
[1:55:14] hindered that's what the matter with our
[1:55:16] Pentacost of faith
[1:55:18] today we've let too many things Hinder
[1:55:24] e the faith that we have
[1:55:28] taught the Holy Spirit that's been
[1:55:30] living in
[1:55:31] us we've let too many
[1:55:34] things looking at somebody
[1:55:38] else
[1:55:41] hinderance another
[1:55:43] quote all right come
[1:55:46] lady this was in the line of
[1:55:49] De everybody real reverent
[1:55:53] look
[1:55:54] here what's the cause
[1:56:01] of see there are there is several things
[1:56:05] can do
[1:56:06] it but you know if you go to the
[1:56:13] doctor and he would examine your
[1:56:16] ears he would
[1:56:18] say now here the for
[1:56:23] instance he says the nve in the eardrum
[1:56:27] is
[1:56:31] dead well doctor what killed the
[1:56:34] ner I don't know the only thing I
[1:56:38] know is what I can see but I know the
[1:56:42] nve itself is dead in
[1:56:47] the in other words you can't
[1:56:50] hear because the n is
[1:56:53] dead is not passing the
[1:56:58] sound to reach the eard
[1:57:02] Dr that's what the matter with
[1:57:05] you that's why you don't you don't
[1:57:08] hear well what killed the
[1:57:10] N I don't
[1:57:13] know why did it kill all over Why didn't
[1:57:18] it kill it all over its body
[1:57:24] like if there is a transparent band
[1:57:26] around my
[1:57:40] hand can see through
[1:57:45] that maybe you have a transparent cover
[1:57:48] on your
[1:57:50] hand you cannot see
[1:57:54] it the eyes can go through it and you
[1:57:57] don't see it because the eyes can go
[1:58:00] through transparent because it is
[1:58:03] transparent my
[1:58:05] hand uh my hand would turn black and
[1:58:10] blue and swell
[1:58:15] up well the doctor might come and
[1:58:18] say now the circulation stopped in in
[1:58:24] here he will see the blood come and when
[1:58:27] he reaches here it can't pass so the
[1:58:31] hand this side is swen and even turn
[1:58:36] col because there is something
[1:58:41] holding amen if it's
[1:58:45] transparent I can't see
[1:58:50] it I don't know he he may I don't know
[1:58:53] he may say I don't
[1:58:55] know he can't feel
[1:58:57] it that's the only thing that anyone can
[1:59:01] work
[1:59:03] on is what you can
[1:59:07] see
[1:59:08] feel of some of the senses will declare
[1:59:13] will
[1:59:16] declare well now here is what it is is
[1:59:20] the devil
[1:59:22] you see why he's calling it a
[1:59:23] transparent
[1:59:28] band because the devil a doctor cannot
[1:59:31] see a
[1:59:33] demon a demon will come and hold
[1:59:36] there a doctor will not see
[1:59:39] it but its effect will be
[1:59:42] [Music]
[1:59:44] seen he will see that the blood cannot
[1:59:48] pass but what is hindering
[1:59:50] it he will not
[1:59:52] see
[1:59:55] amen that's
[1:59:57] why Divine Healing works much better
[2:00:00] than medical
[2:00:05] healing because
[2:00:08] sicknesses behind sickness is is the
[2:00:12] devil and the devil canot and the
[2:00:14] doctors cannot see the
[2:00:17] demon but for us we can
[2:00:19] see when we see there is a sickness
[2:00:23] we know there is a devil there and we
[2:00:25] have power and
[2:00:27] authority amen when we pray that demon
[2:00:32] goes amen and then when it lives then
[2:00:36] where it is
[2:00:38] holding that place now is
[2:00:41] free here here is what it is it's the
[2:00:44] devil now Jesus said it
[2:00:47] was and you you believe him speaking in
[2:00:51] the Bible terms
[2:00:52] said well the de Spirit come out of the
[2:00:56] man he couldn't
[2:00:58] hear the de Spirit the doctor the doct
[2:01:02] the doctor can't tell why the N is dead
[2:01:07] why it's why it's a demon sitting
[2:01:12] there yeah it's it's cut off the hearing
[2:01:15] of the
[2:01:18] ear now if I wanted my hand to rece
[2:01:21] receive life
[2:01:24] again is to lose this transparent
[2:01:31] band yeah it has to be
[2:01:34] removed if it's not if if nature is not
[2:01:42] hindered why it will function all
[2:01:48] right if nature is not
[2:01:52] I believe this helps us
[2:01:55] even when we are praying for the
[2:01:58] sick oh when we praying for cases and
[2:02:04] circumstances we must
[2:02:07] know that we're not fighting and
[2:02:09] wrestling against flesh and
[2:02:12] blood but against
[2:02:15] principalities and
[2:02:18] Powers the devil can come and get a grip
[2:02:22] of your
[2:02:25] husband he can take a grip of your
[2:02:28] mother of your father of your school
[2:02:32] teacher of your wife they be they behave
[2:02:37] you know un
[2:02:41] reason they become
[2:02:44] complicated and for you now you you set
[2:02:47] your arrows against this
[2:02:50] person this is a very evil man he hats
[2:02:54] me doesn't
[2:02:56] me I don't want to come where he is but
[2:02:59] it is not
[2:03:01] him that child is not the
[2:03:04] one but there is a transparent
[2:03:08] B There is a spirit you cannot see it
[2:03:11] with natur your eyes but it's the one
[2:03:16] influencing the stess is manifesting
[2:03:23] so we must know the
[2:03:26] things
[2:03:28] amen so if nature is not
[2:03:31] hindered why it will function all
[2:03:35] right is that right well the transparent
[2:03:38] band has got everything cut off and so
[2:03:41] nature can't
[2:03:49] function move the
[2:03:53] might not be well right
[2:03:56] then but it will get
[2:03:59] well give it a chance and if the devil
[2:04:02] is gone
[2:04:04] out the man can
[2:04:07] hear that now becomes active
[2:04:10] again and the Bible
[2:04:13] said it was a
[2:04:15] spirit when the deaf and dumb Spirit
[2:04:17] went out of the of the man
[2:04:22] speak and
[2:04:23] hear Jesus gave us power over every
[2:04:29] principality every Power Of
[2:04:31] Darkness as a Believer you have power
[2:04:34] over the devil and the devil knows that
[2:04:38] you have the power over him just like a
[2:04:41] robber
[2:04:41] knows that police has power over
[2:04:45] him he able the robber is able to see a
[2:04:47] police
[2:04:49] officer and there that one is
[2:04:53] they will flee they run away he's able
[2:04:56] to look at the BGE he's able to look at
[2:04:57] the
[2:04:58] uniform even you spiritually you are
[2:05:02] dressed different
[2:05:03] spiritually the is able to see you and
[2:05:07] he knows the kingdom you
[2:05:09] represent the demon said Paul we
[2:05:12] know so Paul was known in
[2:05:15] hell we know Jesus we know but who are
[2:05:20] you those people we not born again but
[2:05:24] for you you are born
[2:05:25] again the demon will say that girl I
[2:05:30] know I know that girl I know that boy I
[2:05:35] know hell knows you so when you tell a
[2:05:38] demon
[2:05:40] live it will
[2:05:42] live praise be the name
[2:05:44] of you see now
[2:05:48] hindrance the ear is not
[2:05:50] hearing because and now is being
[2:05:53] hindered a demon is sitting
[2:05:58] there the heart is not functioning well
[2:06:02] because the demon is
[2:06:04] Hing I will not
[2:06:07] forget h a certain case in our
[2:06:13] church excuse me it sounds funny but you
[2:06:15] just excuse
[2:06:17] me is for illustration
[2:06:21] a certain aged man came to the
[2:06:24] pulit he says in his
[2:06:27] testimony that one time he was suffering
[2:06:29] from
[2:06:30] diabetes he went to some other
[2:06:33] Christians they prayed for him he got
[2:06:36] he but there is a member on his
[2:06:41] body that remained kicked
[2:06:45] off
[2:06:48] disabled and that was his manhood
[2:06:53] so one Sunday he comes in the prayer
[2:06:57] line I didn't know what he was suffering
[2:06:59] sometimes I ask people what they
[2:07:01] suffering from sometimes I
[2:07:03] don't so I prayed for
[2:07:06] him and he went he said at night when he
[2:07:10] was
[2:07:11] sleeping here is the point he saw
[2:07:15] himself passing
[2:07:17] urine as you know men do it and then he
[2:07:20] saw a
[2:07:22] snake this is the point now he saw a
[2:07:25] snake come through the
[2:07:28] urine come out and then when he woke
[2:07:32] up he was now
[2:07:35] okay his man that had been
[2:07:39] off for long now it was
[2:07:42] okay
[2:07:44] exactly fitting with what we are
[2:07:47] studying
[2:07:49] here so that snake is
[2:07:52] so is the one which was somewhere
[2:07:56] holding now any organ of your
[2:08:00] body that's what
[2:08:02] happens when the devil enters there
[2:08:05] holding and disables
[2:08:09] it and hinders it from
[2:08:13] functioning maybe the eyes maybe the
[2:08:16] nose is not
[2:08:18] smelling because the snake is there
[2:08:22] a demon is there but we have power over
[2:08:26] that we have power over that
[2:08:28] demon with
[2:08:30] prayer the devil will
[2:08:33] go the snake will go and when it
[2:08:36] goes you will be
[2:08:39] free that is Divine
[2:08:42] Healing sometimes you take time to
[2:08:48] realize because if the place has been
[2:08:50] held for long
[2:08:53] and it's been paralyzed
[2:08:56] for now the band is been
[2:09:02] Los it may remain in that
[2:09:08] condition that part that place there may
[2:09:12] remain
[2:09:14] paralyzed for
[2:09:17] some before it realizes
[2:09:22] life again but for you now because you
[2:09:24] feel still you not functioning the
[2:09:29] way you start doubting the prophet told
[2:09:32] us when you doubt he said your
[2:09:36] faith cast that demon
[2:09:39] out but your
[2:09:41] unbelief will call it
[2:09:44] back so remain
[2:09:48] believing no matter how long it takes
[2:09:51] you say when the pastor prayed for
[2:09:55] me that this case will
[2:09:59] settle no matter how painful I'm
[2:10:02] feeling no matter how much I'm
[2:10:05] feeling I believe I was healed his St
[2:10:10] some heal maintain your
[2:10:13] faith you will maintain your
[2:10:18] Liberty even your salvation
[2:10:22] you get it by
[2:10:24] believing and by
[2:10:27] confessing praise be the name
[2:10:30] of now hindrances can happen to
[2:10:34] us in many
[2:10:37] ways praise be the name of the Lord
[2:10:40] hallelujah hallelujah now as a
[2:10:44] Believer let us look at uh you are what
[2:10:49] you are as a child of God
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:54] do you know you are a daughter of God do
[2:10:58] you know you are a son of
[2:11:01] God yes you
[2:11:03] are brother if you have accepted Jesus
[2:11:06] Christ as your lord and
[2:11:09] Savor you believe and you're trusting
[2:11:12] your life for for its salvation on
[2:11:19] him you have eternal life
[2:11:23] you are a child of God it doesn't matter
[2:11:26] how
[2:11:27] long you take not feeling
[2:11:31] it not realizing
[2:11:34] it praise be the name of the
[2:11:36] Lord because sometimes it takes
[2:11:41] long you are still
[2:11:43] battling with a flesh and sometimes you
[2:11:47] don't feel like
[2:11:48] yourself it is not by feeling
[2:11:52] Jesus never ask anybody do you feel
[2:11:55] it he said Do You
[2:11:58] Believe do you believe you're a child of
[2:12:00] God if you believe so then you are a
[2:12:04] child of God praise be the name of Lord
[2:12:08] and the seed of God is in
[2:12:11] you and the seed of God is in
[2:12:14] you if you're a child of God the seed of
[2:12:17] God is in if you're a child of God of
[2:12:21] eternal life is
[2:12:22] there if you believe if you're a child
[2:12:25] of God in you there is a SE there is a
[2:12:29] power there is a potential that can get
[2:12:32] you out of
[2:12:34] the amen because you are a child of God
[2:12:39] the of God is in
[2:12:44] yous whatsoever is born of God it
[2:12:47] overcomes the
[2:12:49] world Maybe the time you are being
[2:12:54] oppressed you are being
[2:12:57] oppressed and even some habits are still
[2:12:59] disturbing
[2:13:00] you you have not yet got overcoming
[2:13:04] power I want to encourage you don't lose
[2:13:10] [Applause]
[2:13:11] hope you are a child of
[2:13:15] God the seed in you the seed in
[2:13:19] you you should continue
[2:13:22] confessing and even believing hallelujah
[2:13:26] amen you will get
[2:13:29] Victory the victory you
[2:13:31] think that you must reach
[2:13:35] amen
[2:13:38] now if you a child of
[2:13:41] God what does it mean here is a
[2:13:45] simple
[2:13:49] formula that you know very
[2:13:52] well that if you're a child of
[2:13:55] God it means you are a
[2:14:00] god do you believe that to be a child of
[2:14:05] God is to be an offspring of
[2:14:08] God and the child of
[2:14:14] is amen a child of a cow is a
[2:14:17] cow what about a child of God he's a
[2:14:22] god he's a
[2:14:24] God
[2:14:26] Amen no wonder you called a
[2:14:29] Christian Jesus said I am the two Vines
[2:14:34] you are the branches what is the branch
[2:14:36] of a
[2:14:38] mango a mango if I bring you a branch of
[2:14:42] mang and say what is
[2:14:44] this say that's a mang isn't that right
[2:14:48] so if you're a branch of Jesus Jesus is
[2:14:51] a vine and a branch then what are you
[2:14:55] you are a little
[2:14:58] Jesus little
[2:15:00] Christ you are Christ you are a
[2:15:04] Christian no wonder Jesus said by their
[2:15:08] fruits you shall know them they can they
[2:15:11] can impersonate
[2:15:13] gifts they impersonate healing they can
[2:15:17] impersonate this and
[2:15:19] that but because they are not a seed of
[2:15:24] God because they are not a seed of
[2:15:27] God they have not received the seed of
[2:15:31] God what is the seed of God the seed of
[2:15:34] God is the word of
[2:15:37] God in the beginning was the word and
[2:15:40] the Word was with God and the Word was
[2:15:42] God and the Word was made
[2:15:45] flesh and the Very word that God said in
[2:15:48] the beginning
[2:15:51] be let there be let there be and other
[2:15:55] seeds came from that
[2:15:58] word in other words this one here came
[2:16:03] from the
[2:16:03] word the seed of this was produced by
[2:16:07] the word no wonder you can look at a
[2:16:11] plant and you see the
[2:16:13] Bible because this is an offspring of
[2:16:23] amen but at the end of it
[2:16:27] all God
[2:16:30] himself he gave birth to
[2:16:34] himself he gave birth to himself in
[2:16:38] Adam Son of
[2:16:42] God now
[2:16:44] child gives birth to you that's right
[2:16:47] amen that's right
[2:16:50] your child gives birth to you because
[2:16:55] your child is your
[2:16:57] seed isn't
[2:16:59] it now if they giving
[2:17:01] birth they are multiplying you now
[2:17:06] Adam was a child of God he had to give
[2:17:10] birth his children was to bring
[2:17:14] forth God's children that were in The
[2:17:17] Book of
[2:17:18] Life he was to produce that
[2:17:21] but he failed to do so because he fell
[2:17:25] and what he produced was
[2:17:29] hybrid said every person born on
[2:17:33] Earth be the pop of Rome the
[2:17:37] bishop W he said he born he was born
[2:17:43] between Satan and
[2:17:46] E because that meeting in the in the
[2:17:50] garden
[2:17:52] between Satan and
[2:17:54] EV it it created a
[2:17:58] formula he the word of
[2:18:01] God I breed
[2:18:04] it with
[2:18:05] unbelief with
[2:18:09] wisdom evil
[2:18:11] wisdom a little of that
[2:18:14] hybrid the word of
[2:18:16] God it changed the original formula
[2:18:21] it made a
[2:18:23] formula and through that
[2:18:25] formula we come into the
[2:18:27] world that's why every
[2:18:31] man born between sat and
[2:18:38] Eve no
[2:18:40] wonder you born a sinner brother God has
[2:18:44] does not condemn him for being a
[2:18:48] sinner but he will
[2:18:52] any for remaining a
[2:18:55] sinner put away for
[2:18:58] him to be born
[2:19:00] again why you must be born
[2:19:03] again because the original
[2:19:06] birth has a
[2:19:08] problem therefore it has to be
[2:19:11] repeated the right way the original way
[2:19:16] you you were to be
[2:19:18] born by the one
[2:19:22] by the
[2:19:23] word brother said
[2:19:26] Jesus was that
[2:19:29] se that if was to bring
[2:19:33] forth if was to bring forth
[2:19:37] Jesus and then Jesus would bring forth
[2:19:42] you and
[2:19:45] me but she
[2:19:48] failed why she failed
[2:19:52] Mary
[2:19:56] did hallelujah amen because Mary when
[2:20:00] the word was spoken to
[2:20:02] her said uhhuh just tell me a bit a
[2:20:06] little how is it going to happen it will
[2:20:09] happen like this the power of the most
[2:20:11] high will overshadow you now you have
[2:20:14] received the word now spoken to you the
[2:20:16] word receive it now the power come you
[2:20:21] Quicken that and there a child will be
[2:20:25] formed and she yes I see Amen Let It Be
[2:20:30] unto me according to your
[2:20:33] word she believe the word pated word of
[2:20:39] God and that
[2:20:41] word
[2:20:43] formed
[2:20:46] baby do you know that's one of the
[2:20:48] greatest Mysteries
[2:20:50] that have been revealed to us by
[2:20:53] Malachi no wonder the Bible is a new
[2:20:56] book to
[2:20:58] us the world is saying hail
[2:21:02] Mary Mother of
[2:21:05] God how
[2:21:06] can a human
[2:21:09] being give birth to
[2:21:12] God remember we were to be
[2:21:16] Redeemed by a spotl blood
[2:21:21] perfect spotless stainless
[2:21:25] BL because if you're watching a d
[2:21:28] cross in
[2:21:31] water can it be
[2:21:34] clean so a blood of a
[2:21:37] sinner can it cleanse a
[2:21:40] sin so every human
[2:21:44] race I mean every human being since the
[2:21:47] fall in
[2:21:49] Eden the blood the human blood line was
[2:21:58] contaminated and in the noral
[2:22:02] bath mother
[2:22:05] contributes and father
[2:22:08] contributes and you find a child bearing
[2:22:10] the traits of
[2:22:13] the all the traits of the father because
[2:22:16] they both
[2:22:17] contribute mother contributes egg
[2:22:21] and father contributes
[2:22:23] seed and then a child
[2:22:26] is if Mary contributed an
[2:22:32] egg that would pass the
[2:22:37] contamination of the human
[2:22:40] race of the Fallen adamic
[2:22:44] blood
[2:22:45] blood so she was not to contribute
[2:22:48] anything
[2:22:50] this
[2:22:51] Redeemer was to be
[2:22:54] spotless
[2:22:56] stainless pure
[2:22:58] blood so what
[2:23:01] happened amen the word of God that was
[2:23:05] spoken to
[2:23:06] her created an
[2:23:08] egg and created a seed and the Egg and
[2:23:13] the seed
[2:23:14] formed
[2:23:16] reacted brought for a
[2:23:18] child who is the mother of
[2:23:22] the word who is the father of the
[2:23:25] SE the word Jesus Christ was the
[2:23:30] word made
[2:23:33] flesh praise be the name of the Lord and
[2:23:37] that's how we were to be born
[2:23:39] also we were to be born by the
[2:23:44] world but now we were Bound by the lust
[2:23:47] of the flesh
[2:23:50] no wonder we come into the
[2:23:52] world with an evil
[2:23:55] nature that's why we must be born again
[2:23:58] you see when David Fell you remember
[2:24:01] what he did but when he was
[2:24:04] repenting in Psalms
[2:24:06] 51 he said beh behold I was s in
[2:24:12] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[2:24:15] conceived
[2:24:18] me she conceived me
[2:24:21] David was not born out of
[2:24:24] adultery no he was born under the
[2:24:30] family father and mother Mar
[2:24:34] people but he says I was SE in
[2:24:37] iniquity and in sin I was
[2:24:41] conceived that's the very reason why we
[2:24:43] must be born
[2:24:45] again so when Jesus came here he was
[2:24:48] that perfect SE
[2:24:52] fully from the
[2:24:54] word an offspring of the
[2:24:58] word Jesus was an offspring of the
[2:25:01] word so he was the word in
[2:25:05] flesh praise be the name of the Lord he
[2:25:08] was the
[2:25:10] word and in him was eternal
[2:25:14] life praise God that's why he
[2:25:19] said no man can take away my
[2:25:22] life I have power to lay down and I have
[2:25:26] power to have I received on my father in
[2:25:30] this
[2:25:31] law the law of life that is in

[2:26:56] Grave Hallelujah I cannot die he could
[2:27:00] not he could walk on the
[2:27:02] water he could defy every law of
[2:27:07] nature because he was an offspring of
[2:27:10] super he could defy the law of
[2:27:13] nature water turn water
[2:27:17] into he could multiply bread
[2:27:21] and F tens of thousands of
[2:27:23] people hallelujah he has all the power
[2:27:27] to him belongs all the
[2:27:29] glory that's why every knee must bow and
[2:27:34] every tongue must conf that Jesus
[2:27:38] is in him is eternal
[2:27:41] life oh hallelujah hallelujah glory be
[2:27:45] to and you happen to know you a child of
[2:27:49] God
[2:27:50] you are a child of God you born of that
[2:27:57] incorruptable and Jesus Christ he SP
[2:28:01] three and a half
[2:28:02] years showing that
[2:28:05] seed in the hearts of these men and

[2:28:22] them if a grain of seed if a grain of
[2:28:26] wheat Falls not in the ground and

[2:28:35] in the ground and it dies then it can

[2:29:07] quality he knew the only way it can
[2:29:10] happen he becomes in
[2:29:13] them the life that was in him was to
[2:29:17] come into them and water the seed
[2:29:23] the word
[2:29:24] said that they have
[2:29:29] received
[2:29:35] hallelu
[2:29:37] says the Holy Spirit which was in
[2:29:40] Eden it was there to water the seed that
[2:29:44] God had
[2:29:47] spoken So Adam came forth
[2:29:51] from the
[2:29:52] seed and after being
[2:29:54] quickened by the holy
[2:29:58] spirit
[2:29:59] amen now

[2:32:29] surrounded by men and
[2:32:31] women who are nothing but a
[2:32:36] multiplication of Jesus he that
[2:32:38] believeth in me the works that I do
[2:32:42] shall do them great
[2:32:46] works that is what we need that's what
[2:32:49] it means to be
[2:32:55] Christian and when that original Church
[2:32:59] fell God promised I will
[2:33:03] restore I restore and what has he done
[2:33:06] in the
[2:33:07] restoration he has sent a faithful
[2:33:10] messenger faithful to his
[2:33:13] word a mouthpiece of
[2:33:15] [Applause]
[2:33:18] God the mouthpiece of
[2:33:21] God God could not use a
[2:33:24] theologian God could not use just
[2:33:27] a it's not by flesh and blood but a
[2:33:31] prophet is a mouthpiece of
[2:33:37] God Amen In Those Old Times in the
[2:33:42] king's
[2:33:43] palaces the
[2:33:46] Queens would be kept and protected and
[2:33:49] served
[2:33:51] with
[2:33:52] UNS men who have no
[2:33:55] seed they keep that
[2:33:59] Queen they keep her for her
[2:34:02] husband that's a
[2:34:04] prophet a prophet is a
[2:34:09] un he cannot pass his own
[2:34:12] seed but his faithful to keep the bride
[2:34:16] for the seed of the husband
[2:34:20] but
[2:34:21] theologians they have their own SE to
[2:34:25] pass that's
[2:34:27] why the Bible calls her a great
[2:34:34] hot and she has
[2:34:37] daot those are the denominational
[2:34:41] churches their wombs is not clean it's
[2:34:46] not pure it does not receive seed of
[2:34:50] man but this women they keep receiving
[2:34:54] SE from different
[2:34:57] men you ask
[2:35:00] them where does it
[2:35:02] say that Mary went to heaven with
[2:35:06] without
[2:35:08] dying they say it was said by Pope
[2:35:12] Pas in

[2:35:20] [Music]
[2:35:22] and a child of another pop and a child
[2:35:25] of another
[2:35:26] Po and pcal denominations are no
[2:35:30] different and the anglicans and the

[2:35:39] William
[2:35:40] Bram the seed we have is the seed of
[2:35:44] Jesus

[2:35:51] peace Isaiah didn't have a piece of his
[2:35:54] a seat of his
[2:35:56] own when he said a virgin
[2:36:00] conce if you ask him what do you mean
[2:36:04] how can it be has never happened he
[2:36:07] would tell you I also don't
[2:36:09] know but what I know that the same
[2:36:12] spirit that always
[2:36:14] inspires he the one who Moved My
[2:36:18] T say
[2:36:20] so a prophet is a mouth of
[2:36:24] God so in this age God out to send a
[2:36:30] mouthpiece and through that
[2:36:32] mouthpiece he passed his
[2:36:36] seed and it is
[2:36:38] pure no

[2:41:25] to lose and to

[2:41:31] belong to her there are two
[2:41:34] people who own that
[2:41:38] position that when you
[2:41:40] bind it is
[2:41:43] bound Heaven
[2:41:46] binds and when you lose it Heaven
[2:41:50] loses because your God is
[2:41:54] government down
[2:41:58] here amen I'm told in
[2:42:03] Cong there was some it was a war or some
[2:42:07] family and then there was a Pentecostal
[2:42:11] church that took days of fasting and
[2:42:15] pray and message people were their
[2:42:17] neighbors
[2:42:20] and they wer praying and
[2:42:22] fasting and go told the
[2:42:25] Pentecostals go tell those
[2:42:28] people prophecy broke
[2:42:32] up and those people to pray for when
[2:42:37] they
[2:42:39] pray they are the ones
[2:42:45] here if my people
[2:42:49] called by my name shall humble
[2:42:52] themselves and pray and seek my face
[2:42:56] behold I will hear from
[2:42:59] Heaven There are people who
[2:43:01] pray and God will
[2:43:04] hear
[2:43:13] his the problem you don't
[2:43:16] pray you must know
[2:43:20] that you are the ones who and heaven
[2:43:23] will
[2:43:26] [Applause]
[2:43:28] happen brother said brother Bram
[2:43:32] said he said the body operates by the
[2:43:39] head imagine if my head was flesh
[2:43:50] and my
[2:43:51] body was
[2:43:57] concrete if the head tells it
[2:44:02] move it the information cannot go
[2:44:07] through because they're not the
[2:44:10] same so how can Jesus be the head of
[2:44:17] the he cannot those
[2:44:21] denominations they hear what their
[2:44:25] says what the pass is what they
[2:44:29] follow but there are people in the land
[2:44:32] they don't care who you are whether you
[2:44:34] are Bishop whether you're Pastor whether
[2:44:37] you're overseer you canot you can only
[2:44:41] convince
[2:44:42] them when you saw them the
[2:44:45] word they ask you where is it in the
[2:44:48] word
[2:44:50] Hallelujah because Jesus is their
[2:44:54] husband and Jesus is the word those are
[2:44:58] the people to whom he is
[2:45:05] head and His
[2:45:07] Garment is upon those
[2:45:11] shoulders so brother brah
[2:45:16] said because head
[2:45:19] the same
[2:45:20] material with body if head is flesh body
[2:45:25] is concrete they cannot
[2:45:28] coordinate so there must be a body which
[2:45:32] is
[2:45:33] flesh of the
[2:45:35] flesh the head is flesh the body is
[2:45:38] flesh same
[2:45:40] material the body is word and the head
[2:45:44] is
[2:45:44] W the body is W the head is wor we are a
[2:45:49] worthy
[2:45:50] church amen amen hallelujah and then he
[2:45:55] said he said do you see

[3:01:34] receive can create another
[3:01:40] world it is a seed that will get you out
[3:01:43] of the
[3:01:45] ground if you are buried there

[3:02:06] to
[3:02:09] walk raise the
[3:02:11] dead can create another
[3:02:16] world when brother br spoke those squir
[3:02:18] into
[3:02:20] existence he didn't call them from where
[3:02:23] they were
[3:02:25] hiding he created them from his
[3:02:28] word the squ which were not born by
[3:02:31] father by
[3:02:34] mother they were not born young and then
[3:02:37] had a chance to
[3:02:39] grow they never ate any food on
[3:02:42] Earth he spoke it and and shot
[3:02:46] it and took it home and ate
[3:02:52] it why because he's a child of
[3:02:55] God the child of God
[3:02:58] is a creator that se word that was in
[3:03:03] him in you and
[3:03:05] me that means we can create another

[3:03:16] squirrel speak trees can speak grass can
[3:03:21] speak fish can speak
[3:03:24] crocodile can speak another
[3:03:31] word now that is in
[3:03:37] you but it can be
[3:03:41] hindered that those potentials those
[3:03:44] attributes
[3:03:48] that it will not be
[3:03:49] seen what we need
[3:03:53] today is not pray for more
[3:03:58] power you got enough
[3:04:01] power to make a new
[3:04:04] Earth what you need is Faith to use that
[3:04:09] power what you need is to control that
[3:04:13] life and live such a Godly life
[3:04:19] that when you ask God
[3:04:22] anything you
[3:04:24] know we have confidence in God of
[3:04:28] that we know that if we keep his
[3:04:31] Commandments he will withhold no good
[3:04:34] thing from
[3:04:35] us if we walk with him God working with
[3:04:42] us the power is there but you need one
[3:04:47] is
[3:04:54] life a Godly
[3:04:57] life is anac to your faith ungodly
[3:05:01] life a sinful life is an
[3:05:05] obstacle to Faith because as you come to
[3:05:09] pray the devil floods
[3:05:12] you the things you've been
[3:05:15] doing the things
[3:05:20] so you lose
[3:05:23] confidence but for you to create another
[3:05:26] world you don't need another
[3:05:28] Power you it shall not come from Heaven
[3:05:32] it's in
[3:05:33] you what you need is the
[3:05:36] faith and the good
[3:05:38] [Music]
[3:05:41] life living the life of the world
[3:05:49] now the first thing before we can have
[3:05:52] faith we've got to have some foundation
[3:05:55] for
[3:05:57] Faith there's got to be something behind
[3:06:03] it this is from the message the
[3:06:06] fundamental foundation for
[3:06:10] faith if you got to have if you have
[3:06:14] faith you need a
[3:06:16] foundation fundamental
[3:06:21] one now here is the
[3:06:23] foundation the foundation where you you
[3:06:25] can lay the
[3:06:28] faith where you can
[3:06:31] stand and move
[3:06:34] mountains do you ever think of those
[3:06:37] things along those
[3:06:39] lines we are human beings and what made
[3:06:43] us human beings what made us different
[3:06:45] from anything else us
[3:06:50] the human
[3:06:51] beings no matter what state a man is
[3:06:55] in he's yet a Son of
[3:06:58] God no matter how
[3:07:00] sinful he is how far away he is he is a
[3:07:06] fallen
[3:07:07] son but yet he's a son God is his
[3:07:11] Creator God is his maker God God has
[3:07:15] bought him with a price
[3:07:17] he he may never reconcile himself to
[3:07:21] that he may never accept
[3:07:24] it it may never do him any
[3:07:27] good but yet he's a son and she's a
[3:07:30] daughter of God how many human beings
[3:07:32] are
[3:07:35] here say
[3:07:39] Amen you blessed you're the human
[3:07:43] being to be a human being means you are
[3:07:46] a child of God
[3:07:50] so we are Fallen children of
[3:07:54] God but for us now God has brought us
[3:07:58] back but the other human beings they
[3:08:01] also sons of God they may never
[3:08:04] reconcile
[3:08:07] themselves they never come back to that
[3:08:10] position they lost it and they will
[3:08:13] never come back to but for you you child
[3:08:17] of God who lost it as AAL son but you
[3:08:22] came
[3:08:23] back Hallelujah hallelu that's a
[3:08:26] fundamental
[3:08:28] Foundation now God when he made m in in
[3:08:31] the
[3:08:33] beginning he made him
[3:08:36] Superior to
[3:08:38] anything he gave him the the
[3:08:41] jurdic of everything on Earth to control
[3:08:45] everything he controlled the animal life
[3:08:48] he controlled the for
[3:08:50] Life the fishes of the sea he controll
[3:08:54] the winds he controlled the plant life
[3:08:57] he controlled everything man was made as
[3:09:00] a as a secondary God on Earth he was
[3:09:05] given the power to control things all
[3:09:09] elements of the
[3:09:10] earth that was Adam that was was given
[3:09:14] these great powers
[3:09:17] but then the power that he was given to
[3:09:19] make to make
[3:09:26] himself is where he
[3:09:28] fell Adam could speak to the
[3:09:30] winds and it would stop he could speak
[3:09:33] to the trees and they would obey him he
[3:09:36] could speak to the wild life he would
[3:09:40] obey him he could speak to the
[3:09:42] waters that what it was everything obey
[3:09:45] Adam now that is the beginning of man
[3:09:49] that's why God G him power
[3:09:52] over everything of the earth now through
[3:09:55] the fall he lost that
[3:09:58] power then he becomes
[3:10:03] unconscious of the
[3:10:06] fact after losing his listen man
[3:10:10] suffered
[3:10:13] from amnesia
[3:10:20] does no longer know what he

[4:03:26] our our love
[4:03:29] offering our pastor had to rush because
[4:03:31] they have another service at at
[4:03:34] [Music]
[4:03:35] Z but uh we can surely say that God has
[4:03:38] spoken to
[4:03:40] us
[4:03:42] amen how many can say God has spoken to
[4:03:45] me amen what you heard were not words of
[4:03:49] a
[4:03:50] man but we words of God and so we should
[4:03:54] take it
[4:03:56] serious really take it
[4:03:58] serious whatever we need to take out of
[4:04:00] the
[4:04:02] way we need to take it out of the way
[4:04:06] see young
[4:04:07] people there's a lot of potentials that
[4:04:10] you
[4:04:11] have a lot of potentials
[4:04:15] um a lot of
[4:04:18] things in
[4:04:20] us that the devil is
[4:04:22] hindering and you see let me tell you
[4:04:25] sometimes even those little things that
[4:04:27] you do or you are addicted to or
[4:04:29] attached
[4:04:32] to they may not necessarily take you to
[4:04:37] hell but they will
[4:04:39] hinder the purpose and will of God for
[4:04:42] your life here on Earth
[4:04:45] and you will not leave your
[4:04:47] purpose and you will answer for
[4:04:50] it because there is a
[4:04:52] time when we will all appear before the
[4:04:55] Judgment seat of
[4:04:56] Christ so we really need to take out all
[4:04:59] the hinderances
[4:05:01] and serve God with all our
[4:05:05] hearts and take out what is out in
[4:05:10] us a sinful
[4:05:12] life is obstacle to your
[4:05:15] faith and if you have no
[4:05:17] faith you can please God and if you
[4:05:20] can't please
[4:05:22] God you cannot receive certain times
[4:05:24] even prayers that things maybe for
[4:05:27] healing
[4:05:29] salvation whatever is it is that you
[4:05:32] need so we really need
[4:05:35] to watch
[4:05:36] [Music]
[4:05:38] that may God help us to do
[4:05:41] that is that your microphone
[4:05:52] work praise the
[4:05:58] Lord
[4:06:01] amen we're going to give an
[4:06:05] offering a pastor didn't even stay to
[4:06:07] have
[4:06:09] lunch so I'm requesting us to give
[4:06:12] generously
[4:06:15] because I know they they might break
[4:06:17] Branch somewhere to have lunch or
[4:06:19] something so I pray that we give
[4:06:23] generously so that you can be enough to
[4:06:25] take care of their
[4:06:27] L is that 100%
[4:06:31] amen
[4:06:33] amen and also today you
[4:06:36] notice where is Brother
[4:06:38] Martin you know sometimes the Holy
[4:06:41] Spirit nudges me to do things
[4:06:47] uh like today power was
[4:06:50] fine but you know spoke with Brother
[4:06:53] Martin and he too was being moved by the
[4:06:56] Holy Spirit on
[4:06:58] the said that shall we as shall we need
[4:07:01] a
[4:07:03] generator I said Brother Martin we will
[4:07:06] need a
[4:07:07] generator we need it stand
[4:07:10] by shall we get only the generator or
[4:07:12] also the fewer
[4:07:14] I said everything make everything stand
[4:07:17] by because we we will need it I was
[4:07:20] convinced we will need
[4:07:22] it and so when Brother Martin went to
[4:07:25] our
[4:07:27] Treasurer to get
[4:07:30] funds uh brother Joel called and
[4:07:34] asked I don't think we will need the
[4:07:37] generator because it's a lot of money
[4:07:41] whenever we have a generator it costs us
[4:07:42] 100,000
[4:07:46] I told him uh we will need it
[4:07:50] brother and we indeed needed
[4:07:53] it we indeed needed it but because it
[4:07:56] was not
[4:07:58] ours maybe it is old it did not work as
[4:08:02] we would have wanted it to
[4:08:04] work so church we need a
[4:08:09] generator now I was speaking with one of
[4:08:11] the Deacons
[4:08:14] and I was
[4:08:15] encouraged to do what I want to do
[4:08:18] today there is a lot of things
[4:08:21] here that I've been deeping going down
[4:08:24] into my own Pockets to
[4:08:29] do most of the musical
[4:08:33] instruments the media
[4:08:35] department and these are millions of
[4:08:37] money speakers this and that and because
[4:08:41] of that
[4:08:43] it denies you of
[4:08:47] blessings since we started contributing
[4:08:50] for our land
[4:08:52] fund weekly how
[4:08:56] many can raise up their
[4:08:59] hand and God has supernaturally opened
[4:09:02] Financial
[4:09:07] doors since I started committed giving
[4:09:10] in a committed way
[4:09:14] how many here can say
[4:09:16] that okay now I'd like two or three
[4:09:21] people who have serious
[4:09:24] testimonies on the doors the financial
[4:09:27] doors God has
[4:09:29] opened since we started this I'd like
[4:09:32] you to come up here
[4:09:34] quickly and
[4:09:36] testify so that the others can know what

[4:09:46] testimony brother Isaac are we still
[4:09:48] streaming yeah this is good yes God
[4:09:51] bless you
[4:09:53] Church yeah for me the Lord has done a
[4:09:55] lot
[4:09:58] financi I needed money over
[4:10:03] [Music]
[4:10:04] 1.7 cing for some
[4:10:07] things and money mysteriously came
[4:10:14] it was not from my
[4:10:15] pocket no one had to lend me but money
[4:10:19] was
[4:10:20] coming I thank God for
[4:10:23] that this young man I know of his
[4:10:26] testimony how many read that testimony
[4:10:28] on
[4:10:30] WhatsApp that W I think it was Wednesday
[4:10:33] service he has been given to the
[4:10:36] land right out of the little he
[4:10:40] had practically giving out of no out of
[4:10:45] nothing the little he
[4:10:48] has and before we came to the service on
[4:10:52] Wednesday he came to me he had a
[4:10:55] need he's um trying to run certain
[4:10:59] things and he needed um how much the
[4:11:03] last amount you needed
[4:11:05] 700,000 690,000 and he told me Pastor I
[4:11:10] am
[4:11:10] stuck I have nowhere else I can
[4:11:14] I told him brother I wish you know me I
[4:11:18] don't have problems with M if I have it
[4:11:20] I give but I don't know but I would but
[4:11:24] I told him if God would open a door for
[4:11:28] you and you get
[4:11:30] 400,000 I'll give you the rest I'll
[4:11:32] sacrifice another place and I'll give
[4:11:34] you the rest and I spoke it jokingly
[4:11:38] like that and the brother came here in
[4:11:40] the
[4:11:41] service the need was for that that same
[4:11:44] day and it is a very serious need we're
[4:11:47] not speaking it because the time is not
[4:11:50] yet but at the right time we will tell
[4:11:52] you
[4:11:53] the and and and um as um we came in the
[4:11:57] service some of you were in the service
[4:11:59] you remember how God came down and visit
[4:12:01] us and encouraged us and even I remember
[4:12:05] there were words like um if you even if
[4:12:08] you need
[4:12:09] money
[4:12:11] Remember by the way I was preaching that
[4:12:14] I wasn't even having you in mind at that
[4:12:16] moment but he took it he seized it for
[4:12:20] himself and as soon as he went back home
[4:12:24] someone called him he said God spoke to
[4:12:28] me and said take this amount of
[4:12:31] money and send it to someone who needs
[4:12:33] it
[4:12:35] urgently and God brought him in his
[4:12:39] mind and the money was on that brother's
[4:12:42] account
[4:12:43] from another District he sent it to
[4:12:47] him when this one has not even called it
[4:12:50] to ask
[4:12:51] for how much money exactly what I told
[4:12:55] him if God will provide
[4:12:57] that so he came to me and he said God
[4:12:59] has provided
[4:13:02] his now what is
[4:13:04] yours where is it I had to look for
[4:13:08] it God is God God provides

[4:14:07] Fe yeah and had many trials I was going
[4:14:10] through this and

[4:14:17] something
[4:14:19] for I really trusted in God and I knew
[4:14:22] he would do
[4:14:24] it so one of like who had started giving
[4:14:27] money what
[4:14:31] weeks I was talking to my
[4:14:36] former I did not tell him I need

[4:14:59] going to be doing this and this and that
[4:15:02] you're going to be giving me
[4:15:06] month praise God for
[4:15:09] that
[4:15:11] me I told God I want a land I needed a
[4:15:15] l and I told him as I'm paying for
[4:15:20] this need to question
[4:15:23] that by
[4:15:25] June I need my
[4:15:33] [Music]
[4:15:36] land made
[4:15:38] it now I have my
[4:15:40] land and in I believe
[4:15:44] I'm more
[4:15:47] bless bless God bless you Sister she had
[4:15:51] told me of her need some time back and
[4:15:53] we were
[4:15:54] praying but praying
[4:15:57] alone in terms of things of
[4:16:00] money is not
[4:16:02] enough
[4:16:03] pray but
[4:16:06] give says give and ye
[4:16:09] shall receive and God gave her
[4:16:13] land when she didn't even have the money
[4:16:17] one last
[4:16:19] testimony last
[4:16:23] one bless you
[4:16:25] church I also want to thank
[4:16:29] God he provided for me some like when I
[4:16:34] finished my first when I to at my first
[4:16:40] graduation I had done a certificate in
[4:16:42] level
[4:16:46] I need to do a
[4:16:47] DI
[4:16:50] I but at the same moment the school
[4:16:53] introduced level
[4:16:56] three so I was like I would I would
[4:17:02] never
[4:17:05] Lev so because it was a lot of
[4:17:09] money now me whenever I was praying I
[4:17:12] was praying go to give me money and
[4:17:14] complete level
[4:17:17] two so God provided money at the end of
[4:17:22] last
[4:17:25] year so because level three was not was
[4:17:28] was very
[4:17:30] expensive and ever since they brought it
[4:17:32] no one has even
[4:17:35] joined like the minimum to do was like
[4:17:38] 12
[4:17:41] million so no one was were thinking
[4:17:43] about
[4:17:44] it now I was but but I was saving money
[4:17:49] for
[4:17:53] tution okay it was Mone to to to to
[4:17:57] finish
[4:18:01] level so when when now when I when I was
[4:18:05] saving thaty it was still not
[4:18:09] enough so when they introduced the
[4:18:11] church land fund
[4:18:14] I remember Pastor I was preaching about
[4:18:17] sewing I got the Revelation to
[4:18:20] se so I got all the money that was on my
[4:18:25] account I put it in my
[4:18:28] group when I told Pastor he told me you
[4:18:32] are going to
[4:18:34] get I was
[4:18:36] like no he said he didn't say you're
[4:18:38] going to get he said said God is going
[4:18:41] to make you study
[4:18:44] I was like
[4:18:46] what so
[4:18:48] by I think a few like one month
[4:18:54] ago and they actually I was after
[4:18:57] setting it was
[4:19:00] sound after setting it
[4:19:04] someone I don't receive calls but I
[4:19:06] don't know how I don't know how I
[4:19:08] received
[4:19:10] this and someone's like hello
[4:19:13] this is this is this and this from
[4:19:17] from Dixon you you qualify to get a
[4:19:25] scholarship well when you go in the what
[4:19:27] they
[4:19:29] needed like the
[4:19:31] performance I don't
[4:19:34] qualify but I
[4:19:36] qualified and I'm among the
[4:19:39] few and I'm now studing
[4:19:45] Hallelujah brother
[4:19:48] Dixon is an electrical
[4:19:51] engineer anyone who is
[4:19:55] building you can use his
[4:19:58] Services they're studying it's a
[4:20:00] Canadian kind of course it's
[4:20:04] called PE
[4:20:07] yes very I think there is an there's an
[4:20:11] Arab who put an institution
[4:20:14] Ina and he called
[4:20:17] ITA what international po Technic
[4:20:22] yes they put up that
[4:20:25] course and they partner with PS so it's
[4:20:29] a very sophisticated
[4:20:32] course and it's an inter on
[4:20:34] International level so this scholarship
[4:20:37] is talking
[4:20:39] about it is a huge
[4:20:41] thing and and if he qualifies he can
[4:20:44] work anywhere in the
[4:20:47] world but he took because what he had
[4:20:50] was not enough what he
[4:20:52] needed he decided to S it in the
[4:20:56] ministry and God also opened the
[4:20:59] channel we are not
[4:21:05] talking we don't talk about betting this
[4:21:08] is not betting give this you get
[4:21:11] this what are saying is if you serve God
[4:21:16] faithfully and you take care of his
[4:21:18] business he will take care of your
[4:21:21] business he that is faithful in
[4:21:23] little is also faithful in
[4:21:26] much but if you say what I have is
[4:21:29] little and your team leader calls you
[4:21:31] brother what how much
[4:21:36] you even God will you know take you
[4:21:40] that God bless you brother go and finish
[4:21:43] your course and after that get a
[4:21:45] powerful job in Jesus

[4:21:52] at a
[4:21:53] foundation the elders come and has
[4:21:56] encouraged
[4:21:58] us and he has encouraged us
[4:22:01] to he's told us that God will use
[4:22:05] us but for for God to use us we need to
[4:22:09] walk in the footsteps of those that
[4:22:10] walked before us
[4:22:13] when you hear brother brother gide the
[4:22:16] testimony of brother Gideon
[4:22:18] Ministry how they started and how poor
[4:22:22] they
[4:22:23] were but if you see now a church of
[4:22:26] several hundred
[4:22:28] people a Ministry with an impact of you
[4:22:31] know throughout the whole
[4:22:33] country and poor people that he started
[4:22:38] with are the ones that supported that
[4:22:40] Ministry
[4:22:43] not
[4:22:45] from you understand what I'm saying the
[4:22:49] people C the
[4:22:50] vision the pastor may have the vision
[4:22:54] but people have to cat the
[4:22:55] vision and if we are all into the same
[4:22:58] vision it's not pastor's Ministry or
[4:23:02] church ministry it is our
[4:23:05] ministry if we are convinced we must be
[4:23:09] concerned and God will prosper us
[4:23:11] together
[4:23:13] as a team as families as a
[4:23:17] church amen and so I was speaking with
[4:23:20] the Deacon and I told me Pastor you need
[4:23:23] to stop doing
[4:23:24] this you need to stop taking money out
[4:23:26] of your
[4:23:27] pocket and taking the whole burden
[4:23:30] 100% when we have needs in the church
[4:23:33] let us bring it to the people let us
[4:23:36] teach them how to give so that God can
[4:23:39] bless
[4:23:40] them it is very easy to Pastor a church
[4:23:43] when people are blessed
[4:23:46] financially but when people are poor in
[4:23:48] the church it is a
[4:23:51] headache it's a problem this one Pastor
[4:23:54] I don't have
[4:23:56] transport Pastor my child is
[4:23:59] sick in Africa a pastor is the father of
[4:24:02] very
[4:24:04] many and one of the reasons is because
[4:24:06] we don't teach our people to
[4:24:09] give we always believe someone will come
[4:24:13] believe a miracle will come and knock us
[4:24:15] the responsibility is
[4:24:18] yours the government is
[4:24:21] where where on our
[4:24:25] shoulders on P's
[4:24:28] shoulders the church
[4:24:31] shoulders we can look at it that many
[4:24:34] different
[4:24:35] directions but also in this
[4:24:38] way God is counting on us
[4:24:42] to accomplish his work on
[4:24:45] Earth
[4:24:46] amen so I will not repeat that so from
[4:24:51] today hence forth whenever we have a
[4:24:54] need in the
[4:24:55] church for the church I will always
[4:24:58] bring it to you and we will always look
[4:25:01] for that
[4:25:02] money so that God can bless us
[4:25:05] together so before we start
[4:25:08] giving I I needed to say
[4:25:10] this um we need to look for uh the money
[4:25:14] for the
[4:25:16] generator for the past uh for the past
[4:25:19] how long one
[4:25:21] month
[4:25:23] two about three months how has been
[4:25:27] going off
[4:25:29] during we've been blessed the whole time
[4:25:31] where here power was never going but
[4:25:34] something is
[4:25:35] happening I I heard there changes in and
[4:25:39] things this may be the new normal
[4:25:43] we need a
[4:25:45] generator and that
[4:25:49] generator the brother told me 2.2
[4:25:54] million uh it's um I am which brand
[4:26:04] brother okay well the brother is very
[4:26:07] ver with the technical
[4:26:10] things we have confidence in his
[4:26:13] decisions
[4:26:14] those so but we need also long wire and
[4:26:18] a generator and that will cost 2.2
[4:26:22] million so um I was thinking should we
[4:26:25] take from the land fund I said no we are
[4:26:27] not going to take money
[4:26:30] [Music]
[4:26:32] from we want us
[4:26:35] to we them when we already in the
[4:26:39] place we are moving you how much we have
[4:26:43] where's
[4:26:44] brother assistant chairman where is he
[4:26:48] he's out how much did we collect today
[4:26:50] this
[4:26:52] week we are still going down let us come
[4:26:55] out of
[4:26:56] there even the prophecy came out we
[4:26:59] should go back to our first
[4:27:01] love not only spiritually also
[4:27:04] physically and our Ze for the things of
[4:27:10] God don't give you are in which
[4:27:13] church don't have church everybody
[4:27:15] doesn't have but where does this come
[4:27:18] from it comes from those who
