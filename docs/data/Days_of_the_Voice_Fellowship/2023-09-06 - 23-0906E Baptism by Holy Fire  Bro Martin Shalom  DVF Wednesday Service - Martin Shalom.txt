[Music] and you know how I feel nervous to stand before you are redeemed together only shivering with the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus that speaks good word Lord tonight [Music] break each and every sin Lord Jesus may your grace be sufficient for him in a special way and Lord Minister today depending on your what tonight for we know that your word is bless the word we are going to read you give us inspiration [Music] is why we are still standing [Music] yeah you're going to read with me yeah you're reading with me the Book of Luke chapter 3 verses 16 and 17. foreign uh Luke chapter 3 verses 13. we can start from 12. it says that then came also a Publican to be baptized and said unto him Master what shall we do and he said unto them except he said unto them exact no more than that which is appointed you which is pointed you and the soldiers like was demanded of him saying and what shall we do and say it unto them do violence to no man neither cause any falsely and be content beages it as the people we are in ex as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their heart of John whether he were the Christ or not John answered saying unto them all I I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I come the legend of whom shoes are not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with a Holy Ghost and with fire Luca is foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but the shaft it will ban with fire unquenchable foreign [Music] yeah amen Amina blessed with the name of the Lord how come you all in the name of Jesus and this evening just pray for me that the Lord will give me the utterance amen Amina yeah you're not standing here has never been easy but we trust the Lord that he will speak to us I'm going to have something small to share about baptism by holy fires blessed with the name of the Lord hear where we have read we are seeing uh in the Book of Luke 16 he says that John answered saying unto them I indeed baptize you with the water but one mightier than I come the largest of whose shoes I'm not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with a Holy Ghost and with the fire you can do you believe that even today God still baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen because Hebrews 13 8 says that Jesus Christ yes it's the same yesterday the same today and forever and we believe that a hundred percent because words in this last generation there are three things which God did in time passed but when I go and again and the Holy Ghost comes he will bring these things through your members he was putting emphasis on the Holy Spirit and here when John was baptizing John remember all of us so that he was preparing the way some thought that John was the Messiah but John told them that I am not the Messiah but I'm the voice of the one crying the prophet was the Messiah but he was not the message but he was preparing the way blessed with the name of the Lord and here John tells them that when Jesus comes yes he will baptize you with the fire Holy Ghost and Fire blessed be the name of the Lord and even today Jesus is baptizing Believers yes with the Holy Ghost and Fire no more and without the box of the Holy Ghost without being filled with the Holy Spirit there is [Music] to put emphasis on that is blessed be the name of the Lord amen that we must be baptized with the Holy Fire because you must be baptized with that Holy Fire that is the reason we come to church that's the reason why we pray yes God is not taking up just a good church but Rapture is for those who have experience with God being judgment is not enough being a good singer is not enough and it will take you nowhere coming to church will take us nowhere attending every service will not take us anywhere but our progress as a church in the Bible of the Holy Spirit blessed be the name of the Lord amen Hallelujah says in the message who is this [Music] 650221 it was preached on Sunday 1965. but he tell all the world out of you ideas [Applause] of the Holy Ghost amen I mean the importance of the Holy Ghost the reason why we need him when the Holy Spirit comes in US bless him in the name of the Lord he will remember the world out of you and me praise the Lord and because John knew this John knew that his baptism was not announced and remember in Acts 19. the Bible says when uh when Paul was at country when was passing of the uppermost we can read there let us just read there Acts chapter 19. and he came to pass that while apples was at current Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to emphasis and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and he said unto him we have not as such as had whether there be any Holy Ghost foreign [Music] amen Amina if the same question comes and Jesus is asking the same question tonight have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that is the biggest question amen the sign that you believe the proof that we believe is the holy spirit amen because without the Holy Spirit we have no Journey we are not even worship we have not even started to worship no questions blessed with the name of the Lord these brothers did you see the Holy Ghost since you believe it's unfortunate that they are never very hard about it amen amen [Music] [Applause] they and they say it unto him we have not so much hard whether there be any Holy Ghost the way up saying we have known even ever had on the past things amen amen then Saint Paul John very baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto them that they should believe on him we shall come after him that is on Christ Apostle Paul is referring this disciples because John himself says I am not the one I baptize with water amen who is coming after me it's the one who baptized with the fire or the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord the only thing that can cleanse this stuff that is the fire of the Holy Ghost shall be the name of the Lord when we receive the Holy Spirit Amina foreign I'm interested in the box of the Holy Ghost upon the church for this day that we are living in blessed with the name of the Lord rather we cannot break amen I mean there is too much pressure inside outside the world even in the church and the world can suppress that pressure is the Holy Ghost [Music] because the Holy Spirit looks at the promise of God will never believe in the promises there is nothing to believe the word of God [Music] bless them in the name of the Lord [Music] we are just religious bunch of religious people this push us to go and extra mile foreign blessed with the name of the Lord he was not going to come automatically you must do something we must separate we know we must test for God what we need today it is the Holy Spirit the hospital working in our lives because the Bible tells us amen of God in the city with our spirit blessed be the name of the Lord amen the portion of Jesus Christ in US which Jesus is going to take what's going to lift us off this Earth it's not how much investment we have saving to be Mercury father Spirit of Christ between Daniel and the rest of the Israel he has something special in his soul that is what kept reminding him about that promise me to God Amen Amina Daniel knew because the Bible tells us he said according the number of books according to the prophets of Prophet Jeremiah Daniel knew that time was getting close the Bible tells us that Daniel set his heart to seek after God what made Daniel to do that but it was the spirit of God in him because the spirit of Christ seeketh after righteousness blessed be the name of the Lord I mean if there ever was a time when the disciple picked up the burps of the Holy ghosts one of the mightiest weapons that's ever been given to them to the hand of men and I defeated the devil praise be to God the prophet saying that that purpose of the Holy Ghost is one of the mightiest weapons ever been given to a church to the hand of men yeah and they defeated the Holy Ghost will defeat the Devils the holy spirit will put a wall through your heart just receive the holy ghosts allow God to walk on you it is [Applause] foreign you always want to keep us just just good church members to church we come to church and then sometimes we cry and then we go home we wait on Friday come on no things are fine amen and even the devil will say that's not bad amen because even the Devil comes to church every time of worship he comes and worships and he goes back foreign [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord and if we have any time is now is that time you remember brother says that when uh when uh I was talking about the day of Pentacles amen but all these other days was just yeah the devil was settled when you receive the holy spirit that is the beginning of your battles but without that or before that you are not the threat to the devil amen just put it on like lemon's understanding like we are here the government is very okay with us governments no problem you can go anywhere nobody cares but you wake up in the morning blessed with the name of the Lord televisions I am this did you know [Applause] [Applause] but after you are jumping [Music] let us go back foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] foreign amen [Applause] [Music] if you are scared of the Holy Ghost certifier you will never get in yes sir are you scared of him of course no man is being banned with fund is just laughing you can see the baptism the matters amen man this man you are crying they could ban you and then you melt until when you've done crazy [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord Holy Ghost amenities being a member of the church is not enough blessed with the name of the Lord God wants us to be in his body we are building God a house blessed with the name of the Lord Talk of the Temple of Jerusalem a big stones from different parts of the world at every point every piece that was proud it was just spitting in one another we are building the body we will not judge triumphant he was part of that body is break another one is blessed with the name of the Lord but when you are just a church member it's like when they're building foreign away Brothers we know that very well amen I mean by science science through scriptures the events clear by prophecy it is [Applause] for the last 10 years you can tell also Manya the atmosphere used to have um 50 [Applause] 000 could do something today it is like one thousand what I mean the pressures of today it is it is multiplied than the ten years is the spirit of God out of us to get us back to Sons and Daughters of God you need this holy spirit amen God out of Heaven Guru will straighten the church out oh yeah blessed with the name of the Lord do you know why this generation of restoration [Music] from the truth the church was in darkness and God understood the message of restoration in the name of the Lord amen men and women seeking God every day let's say with the name of the Lord the reason I swear maybe we don't pray much it is because we don't read the word enough [Music] but when we read the word we will desire to be like the world we will see how one thing we are Angela because the Bible says he shall be filled you must thirst for God seek the face of God blessed be the name of the Lord Talk of the time we spent on social media compare with the time you spend on your knees when he woke up in the morning [Applause] [Music] oh prayer comes the Holy Ghost and Fire normally will straighten the church that's why Jesus says [Music] yes because they had no Revelations foreign [Applause] we shall die here over Hunger praise be to God but the promise was just near me blessed in the name of the Lord the days we are counting things maybe it was uh it was 40 days 41. 43.48 blessed with the name of the Lord you know when you're waiting on God when things are hard what are we alone [Applause] they're almost reaching you I believe on the on the 48th birthday they started receiving some magnetism to feel some vibrations she was rejoicing in the spirit thanking God [Applause] it's going to come to pass the Bible says they were in one account amen all these days when they were there God Was preparing their mind Nina [Music] [Applause] foreign praise little God our Sinners just be filled with the Holy Ghost one song is enough to bring the praise of God [Applause] will bring the power of God let us be filled with the Holy ghosts so what we need today is the Holy Ghost it will straighten the church after that revive men and women they were on fire they were living for God they hated amen they were so careful you know the more you get close to God but not just you see yourself every time you feel You Are Holy Spirit I am righteousness you know that I'm weak in this aim is to be there help me brother in such a situations he was the prophet God used to hear maybe to prophesy foreign [Applause] foreign amen foreign [Applause] and when it was cleansed then there comes a voice who will go for it the same system God is using it today the reason as to why God is not looking for somebody to send is because we are not serious enough hola blessed the name of the Lord none of us will go to work again 10 minutes after the arrival time and nowadays they have a digital system um amen foreign [Applause] that medicine is not to help God but to help us when we receive the Holy Spirit he said that complete branding completely Brown new unit these are con this is the message of future home of the heaven bride and artery groom uh here that but you but you are a complete brand new unit [Music] God takes the old man and bans him completely not the church but God taking that old man with the Holy Ghost and Fire no more and comes himself hmm [Applause] [Music] we must be baptized every day every day my today's worship [Applause] must be better than much less worship telling them to believe on the one who's coming get down there at the altar again let us utilize this all the time get down at the altari holy [Music] it is a mess but it brings life it is a mess but it brings life I don't care what scale or what level I have to come on New Birth is a messy it is not matter whether you have six park or no praise be to God you see in the world people who go to gyms they take themselves to be superior foreign [Music] but when it comes to spiritual science what make the difference is a Believer being filled with the Holy Spirit the devil does not fear you because of your praying and shouting and singing and what makes the difference between you and the devil is the Holy Ghost enough many believe ourselves five senses like you our attack kids they breathe like you but they use their nose not gills [Music] like fish so we are at the same level but when we receive the burps of the Holy Spirit when our soul is regenerated when our soul is resurrected in our souls that is what make a difference amen that's when we become an ordinary whether it becomes yes sir that's when we are living in Heavenly blessings in Christ Jesus Christ the Holy Cross will make us modify our members [Applause] [Music] it seems there is no SIM card inside praise be to God do you love him I'm about to finish now listen to this quote in the message to zero six zero six Marco it says now there are many listen careful again there is not believing is seeking the Holy Spirit what were the disciples doing really what were they doing there do you think they're playing Ludo um do you think
