And Lord, we thank you for another chance that you have given us Lord to minister to your purchase, Lord Father. And Lord, there's nothing above above us gathering and feeding on your word. We thank you dear heaven father. May you come and break this little bread of life to us and what we need. We need our hearts to burn within us. Oh Lord, we thank you. and we welcome you in the name of our Lord Jesus. Amen. God bless you saints. God bless you musicians. Hallelujah. Amen. So as we still standing, let us read the book of Revelation 4 from verse one. Okay. After this, I looked and behold, a door was open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter." And immediately I was in the spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. Amen. for [Music] guarantee. May God bless the reading. Be seated. God bless each and every one of us. Again I I thank pastor for another opportunity to serve the bride. I had very many thoughts when I was told to preach and yesterday I prayed God to lead me and then because even uh the other part that we had last time we didn't finish it but I decided to take another direction but we are still on come up hither part three for the title it will be the voice we're talking on the voice maybe for a recap uh last time we talked about the judgment seal that how we we all come under the influence of that judgment seal. And the Lord uses it uses it to position the bride in her homeland spiritually speaking. And now we see that whenever we come at the under the influence of this seal, God just watches how we react. And from this seal it it either leads you to the seven or the mark of the beast like Kane when he came under the influence of this seal and then he said this is too much for me. Hallelujah. Amen. You know, but for us the children of God, we always understand that everything is for the good to them that that love God. Hallelujah. I mean, David, he said, but thy ro and thy stuff they comfort me. And I was thinking that as a shepherd of the flock, every good shepherd have the road and the staff. And we saw that being in position, it is far beyond our children, good life in this world. And that's why God can do anything to put you in position. He can even take your wife. He can take your children. He can take your job to position you. We see that position is more important. And then we saw that this bride has to be smitten by this road. Hallelujah. But because of time I didn't give you the the solution uh whenever we come under the influence of this seal. The only thing I gave it was the warning. But the solution is in James chapter 5 verse 13 he say that is any among you afflicted let him pray and we see that that's the only solution that gave us as far as this judgment is concerned And and then also we saw that every time whenever we come to church, we have come at the judgment throne of God, the judgment seat of God. And then now this is the solution of the children of God. First of all, you first calm And if you're afflicted, you pray. You go in prayer. But we see that the devil has given us another solution. And last time we're talking about dimensions a little bit. But the prophet talks about another dimension. It is the fourth dimension. The communication. But he calls it ether. Hallelujah. Amen. And now we see that he said that the devil came and manipulated that dimension into science. But that's the communic that's the dimension that God placed there to communicate with men. Hallelujah. It is it is accessed almost now by everyone the witch doctors the scientists. Hallelujah. He said now like for example he gave an example of the witch of end how was he able how was she able to communicate he said that she was uh she was uh getting the signals she was advice tapping the signals in the other dimension Hallelujah. And now even God uses a dimension to speak to us. Talk about visions. And also now the the prophet that's why he was able to preach the seals. And then he said that uh have have you seen this mysterious week that we have been having is meaning the week of the seals where the angels have been meeting me. And when he was preaching, he could be able to tap into that dimension where the angels were passing more and he could be able to pick the signal and he brings it to the bride using the gift and that's why even speaking in tongues seeing visions or so God can use that you can use that gift to penetrate and tap into the [Music] And I want to cut it short. Then we go to the preaching of today. Now the devil first of all he first manipulated that dimension to science with an intention. And now we saw last time that people there are people here on earth who are living in hell. They don't go to hell when they die. Never. They just switch their place that they and like how it is that people are living in hell today. We have heard another voice telling us to come up hither. Hallelujah. And now like how people are living in hell and living in that dimension of science. I will give you an example. You remember under the opening of the uh fourth seal the prophet say that he his name was death and hell followed him. But where is he? Where is that guy? He's everywhere. He's on the pull pits. He's walking on the streets. You see? So if that guy is connected to people, then hell also is connected to him, not people. Because God never created hell. Hell came after when man fell. I mean when the devil fell. You see? So uh and before uh before the seals we see that the prophet I believe it was a vision when uh when he went in that dimension Was it a vision or he died? End of the two. He went into the fifth dimension. And then he saw something that he has never seen in his. He saw some conditions that were there and he saw these women like Jezebel putting on lipsticks, eyeballs, working on worked on their nails. And he talks about that I believe in the message souls that are in prison. And then these ladies, they were in a terrible condition and the condition was scaring to the prophet and then he cried and said, "Lord, get me out of here." You see, so when he came out later, he saw these women on on earth for the first time and he almost thought, "Have I gone back to hell? You see, hell is on earth and there are people that are living in that dimension. And I tell you that this dimension is connected to your bodies. It is not a place. It is an existence. It's not a place. It's an existence. You see, but but we've got to overcome it completely because we have received a voice that is separating us completely from that dimension where we are going up. Hallelujah. Amen. And now we see we see that when people get trouble even believers of the message instead of going to the other dimension of Revelation 4, they go to the dimension of the devil, WhatsApp WhatsApp communication. You see and now someone gets hurt they go on internet and they post all their feelings there. You see that is lack of revelation. You are first of all you have to understand that you are under the judgment seal of God. whatever troubles that you're going through and then we see that also Isaiah went through it and then he said he said woe is me Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. So the Bible tells us to break in the presence of God into prayer. And also maybe another thing that I may say on that you have to remember that the the lamp is in control of everything. It is a mystery that has been revealed. You remember in revelation chapter 5 that pastor preached to us on Sunday. Um when you remember the voice that cried out which was the lamp in fact and they say that heart not the oil heart not the oil and the wine. It sounds like a commander which means you can do this but don't do this. You see, like Job, the devil first went to to God and everything that happened to him first pass through the desk check of Jehovah for him to say, you see, so it is the same with us. Everything that the devil is doing, God has sinned, has permitted. All that we need, we need just revelation and to understand that God is with us. And then we take the solution that the Bible gives us and then I'll pick it from Jericho. And we saw that the priest had to blow the the gospel trumpet. and people were to shout. [Music] But before they shout, remember, they were given instructions, shout, but they were never told what to shout. They were never told what to say. You see? And now we see that let first read Joshua 5 uh 15 and 14 say that and said unto him you know u Joshua one morning he was standing facing Jericho and then I believe he was thinking how are we going to bring it down and then As he was still looking at Jericho, then he saw a man standing before him with a sword. And this is what Joshua asked him and said unto him, "At thou for us or for our adversary?" And he said, "Nigh, but as captain of the host of the Lord, now come." Remember the prophet says this was after crossing Jordan. As I'm preaching, I pray that you pray with me. You know, getting an inspiration also to bring it out. And my aim is our hearts to burn within us after. Hallelujah. Amen. So the prophet say that this was after the crossing of Jordan. Remember the crossing of Jordan was the breaking of the seven seals. And then the Bible says that signs and wonders in the world. You know this and that bread which types miracles the the first pool and the second pool. But now the prophet says that this pillar of fire turned into a man and it it put on flesh. It ceased to be the pillar of fire that they were looking for. I believe maybe Joshua was standing there looking whether I can see the pillar of fire. But he saw a man with a sword and he asked him, "Are you for us?" Hallelujah. And who was that? We see also the prophet saw. He received that very sword. And then he said, "What's this for?" He said, "This is the sword of the king, the word of God." Hallelujah. Amen. So, and then we see that now what about these people who say uh the pillow fire has appeared, you know, they take photos, they post everywhere. You see, we we no longer look at the pillar of fire, but we look at the person of Christ who was embodied into the prophet himself. Brother Brham and then brother Brham himself, he became the first fruit of his ministry. and then to the church. Hallelujah. So we see that these people they were told to shout but they were not told what to shout. And then when the prophet was preaching the seventh seal, he said that I saw it clearly. First of all, he said that it was uh revealed in three-fold manner. And he said one was yesterday. One today and another one I saw it clearly but it was in an unknown language. Hallelujah. Amen. So we see but we he said but it is the third book you see. So it it first of all it's unknown in unknown language. Okay. But we see that it is connected to the bride because John said there was no man worthy. So it is to do with the man just specifically man [Music] and we see that that's the min the mystery and and then the prophet said that this man was standing before Joshua. He had power. He could just carry those walls of Jericho. Maybe sweep them with the waters from the Red Sea. But wait, there is a part for the bride and that is the unknown language. Hallelujah. There is a part that the bride has play the third fold for the bride. The angel could just wipe it in a minute. And then the prophet said that say that the pillar of fire now was Christ in us. see that when they crossed Jordan, this pillar of fire became a man with a sword. And then maybe for another time, I may not go there, but we see that it's this man that gave them the instructions of how to bring down the walls of Jericho. what fall and so on. Now we see we know that in the book of Thessalonians says that God himself shall descend with a shout voice of the trump. Hallelujah. Meaning he is coming from the seventh dimension to light matter time and that's why it's called a mystery. Hallelujah. Amen. The prophet said heaven and earth embracing and last time I told that that's the ministry of the bride is to bring heaven on earth to bring heaven on earth. Hallelujah. Amen. And now we see that the voice this voice it is the voice of the archangel. You know there's a Pentecostal preacher I was preaching to and then finally was saying that the angel shall stand in the clouds and then the trumpet and then the he first shout and then after shouting then the voice and then the trumpet shall start and then heaven. You see now we see that this voice of the archangel guess what it is the bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah is the bread coming of Christ. You see, I believe I put here this quote here. They say that and in an exposition of the seven church age, the loudesian church say that until in this last day is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the the final voice, the final edge. Sir, the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It is its own mouthpiece. So God is turning on her. [Music] He will confound in her. He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. for the voice of God of the archangel will be in her. So today we are talking about the voice and I will tell you why we have sung that song I surrender. Hallelujah. We going to pick just a few characters in the Bible if time allows like three and then we'll be done. Let's look at Esther. Do you believe that this great mystery of God? Because the prophecy that it was uh not for public, it was like as if it was not uh broken or interpreted. But he said that it is typed throughout the the Bible. It is typed in the shadow. So it means that we can be able to see it clearly. But he left it for the bread. There is a part for us. How can we see it? You remember the two brothers that were walking to a mouse. First of all, they were a bit confused. They were lacking some revelation. They knew Jesus, but they walked with him without realizing that he's the one because I believe he appeared to them in another form. in another form like how he has appeared to us. You see, but what happened? It took God to take them through the types and shadows through from Moses throughout their eyes open and they knew him. Hallelujah. Amen. Now we see that Esther by tribulation she was able to go to the palace. You know the king had first sent his soldiers to come and hunt for them which seemed to be tribulation. And you see but you have to remember that there was a prophet and that was he gave her the words of wisdom and she kept them. The Bible says if she didn't keep them, she would have not been able to reach preach where she wherever she reached. And now we see one time as she was there then through told her come on Esther you have relaxed enough. Now we are coming now to our topic of today. You have relaxed enough. You have enjoyed enough of the first P and the second P. Do you believe that the seals are throughout the Bible? Hallelujah. Believe. So he told her, "You've got to face the king." She had to speak out. Remember the voice of the archangel is within her. But now remember saints, it is this voice that is connected to the resurrection of the dead. It is this voice that is connected to the rapture. That's why brother Gary last time he said that you are the rapture. Simply he was meaning you are the voice. You are that voice. Okay. Amen. But now the reason why we we may God give us grace. Most times we think that the dead are waiting for us. I mean we think we are waiting for them. But every God is waiting for us. The dead are waiting for us because we are the voice and he has he has entrusted us. Hallelujah. So we are the one to bring the rapture and we are to bring the dead. Hallelujah. So we see that told her Esther come on come on enough of your comfort in the palace. Hallelujah. Amen. And now the Bible says that say that Esther had to make a decision. You see it takes us back to the decision making. She said that if I die, I die. She made that uh decision. And then she she said that I will go to the king. But before she went, she had first pray first prepare herself. We shall come to that also. And now she had to face the king and speak. And now here the secret is of all the people in the palace that didn't know. It was the voice of the king in her speaking to the king because everyone was like what? And now you see that the Bible says Now before now Esther approached there it was 30 days of silence of silence. Nothing is happening in the court. Now that silence it needed Esther to break it tap into that silence. And then we see Esther coming down the aisle. She approached the king. And now what is amazing here, the king as if the king was waiting for her. You see if if you look at the response of the king my queen what's th petitional she say that you and honey if it pleases the king come to the banquet because now the bride has to bring the enemy and the Lord at the same table. You see, and now we see here that it had to take a decision for her. And then here it say that then said the king unto her, thou queen Esther, and what is thy request? It shall be even it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom. Something that has never been said before by the prophet say that this it means equality. It means God in the bride. It means that the bride is equal to God. You see, and then in the message uh Christ the mystery of God revealed this is God's great mystery of love expressed that God and man became one. See equality the whole thing is God and man. One. God and man was one there and God and man is one here now. Hallelujah. Is that wonderful? And then we see that the bride has got to speak out. This voice had have to come out. But now this voice come out. The prophet says that the rapture will take a fully surrendered heart surrendering everything including the worldly pleasures all forsaken. You can even forsake your comfort. Instead of feisting on your four millions salary, you decide to pick like two young families, people who have just gotten married, you follow them up that my brother, how are you doing? God has given me a revelation. I will always give you 500 every month. until you stabilize and then there is church land always one million let me tell you it is possible two millions and it's enough then you sacrifice the two millions you see let me tell you rapture it is not an easy thing it will take a fully surrendered heart you Esther had to say that if I die I die but let me leave my comfort. And now remember all the people people are depending on her for their life. So she had to speak out. This voice had to come. Hallelujah. Save the people. Hallelujah. Now the bride has has to speak. This voice has to come out even for the dead for the dead to be quickened. Hallelujah. And now we see another uh little lady that had to speak something that has never happened in history. You know the eastern culture and the old testament they could not regard any words of the little lady. They had no say. They make for them decisions. But this time around it was a mystery. Rebecca, Rebecca. And you see Elza, we all know that he types the prophet or prophet who went forth to look for the bride. And here he comes. But remember go uh his master Abraham he has told him that the angel God will send his angel the angel will be with you and it is true the angel was with him and everything that he prayed to God answered and I want us to watch just a few moments from this little lady here, she came down and uh the prophet or the man of God just said just one word just water to drink. She did hesitate. I want you to look at her heart. She gave him immediately and said I can even feed you a camel. Now the prophet says that that act it is recognizing the prophet and then recognizing his ministry because you can be a message believer but when we have not recognized the ministry or the message but this lady recognized both. Hallelujah. And now quick she ran and now this man told her told her I've come for the wife I want to take you to be my master's son. You see and now quickly she ran home pack my things and go. But these people they asked And I I will read it here say that and they said we will call the dam and inquire at her mouth for the first time. It has never happened. And now the prophet say that her act of feeding the camels, watering them and the servant of God, it was an unspoken language. The language that the prophet saw and he could not interpret. Hallelujah. Amen. Now here he comes. And now these people they told her, "Okay, you can go but you stay here long a little bit longer. You see remember that condition of you you are not too too convinced to believe it with all your heart and you don't have power within you to reject. So you are just there t here for 10 days 10 days in the laws of Moses. Hallelujah. But what did you see under the third when it comes under the third he say that let let the damsel speak. Let the maiden speak. This voice has to come out. And then what did she say? The Bible says that she said I am going that I will go. I will go. And then the Bible say that away they went. And uh I'm going to read for you this quote here. Say that God's great mystery of how it's a secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody know nothing about it. Even the angels didn't understand it. You see, he didn't reveal it. That's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence and I remember this silence it is the the bride of Jesus Christ step into it like how Esther stepped in those 30 days of sale. Hallelujah. And now we see here again also in the book of Esther chapter 10 say that now the king laid tribute laid tribute. Okay. He laid a tribute on land and on the sea. It is like something is that the word. Okay. He lied to on land and on the sea. You remember revelation 10 this night when he came with an open book. He placed his one leg on the land and another one on the sea. the prophecy that he was suppressing every evil spirit [Music] that will hinder the message of Elijah to reach the bride. You see, we have no excuse. We have no excuse completely. There is only one thing that God requires us to do. It is to make that one decision and reach at a point of total surrender. We completely give ourselves there is a someone I was talking to yesterday and and she say that uh you know for us we would want to come for Wednesday service and somehow we don't manage but this is what I told her that I believe as long as we are trying our best. I believe God is not going to take an imperfect bride. There has to come at least a time for you to be perfect. That's what I was praying that God gives us grace. We be able to surrender everything. We surrender everything. and and let that voice of the archangel inside come out and away we go. And now I'm coming to my conclusion here. Uh you you remember can you believe it that the whole New Testament and Old Testament mystery, it was hinged on that little lady of Matthew chapter 2. She came to Christ. And now you see the prophet says, he says that the way he came Jesus coming and Jesus going is the same thing. But now the way he came at first he laid a pattern. He placed pattern. And then it is the same thing, the same pattern that the the braid going of Christ. Hallelujah. Now I want to tell you something small about this this little lady. She was speaking. She had to speak, but she never uttered words. It was unspoken language. Hallelujah. Amen. Whatever she was doing, she was speaking. It was the voice of the archangel in her because now she was the climax of the going of Christ. She she was the claimax. She's not that climaxed. Yes. So we see that it was because of her act. She was in It was her act that triggered all sleeping demons. [Music] No, it was her act that triggered. Okay, it's fine. That triggered all the sleeping demons. Yes, exactly. And these demons were sleeping in Judas and they were everywhere. And away he ran and immediately they came and took him. But the whole mystery was connected this little lady. But she had to speak out an unknown language that even the disciples were like, "What's this?" And this and this is the same thing that is going to happen. It must happen. And this time around is the going away of Jesus the bride. Hallelujah. The bride has to speak out. And now there's another thing that I want you to see that she was in charge of the last event, the going out of Christ. She was in charge of the last evil. And now you see who is this lady is the bread of Jesus Christ. And now the prophet says that this expensive oil that she had. That's all that she had. And she surrendered everything. She surrendered everything to Christ. She said, "I surrender everything. All the worldly pleasures." Guess what will happen? If the bride comes to full maturity and make that decision, we shall go home. As simple as that. You see, because now it will resurrect all the sleeping demons to an extent that God can no longer let us live here and we have to take a flight. Hallelujah. Amen. And now she was in charge of the last events. Guess what? You are in charge of everything. I didn't make a mistake. You are in charge. You may say, "I thought God, yes, it's God." Hallelujah. But remember, he is in the bride, the archangel. He's in the bride. And it is the greatest mystery that perhaps the demons they can't understand. That perturbs the Judas that perturbs everything you see. But we are in control. We are in control in charge of social media. headline of the news everything because it's all about the last events with a climaxing. See the headline comes that Trump has been selected as a president is a president. this and this Russia, Ukraine war, Iran, Israel, the whole mystery, it is hinged on the little bride of Jesus Christ. She is controlling the last event, but the world doesn't know. But we are the one behind YouTube, everything controlling You see, and that's how precious the bride of Jesus Christ is. You see, I say that the decision she made to surrender all she had she had triggered all the demons to speed the bride coming of Christ. Hallelujah. First of all, we have got to leave behind completely. And after leaving behind under the anointing of an ego, then remember it's not just the ego. We have to go further. The Bible says four living creatures. How about if I say five living creatures? Because now the prophet says that the ego has to give way for the lamb himself. Hallelujah. Of course when I talk about the ego I mean the Holy Spirit only that the Holy Spirit was coming in uh different manifestation and anointings and now we see in our age the anointing we are having is the anointing of ego. Yes. So we've got to come up here, live completely, separate ourselves from the dimension of hell and we bring heaven on earth. We unite the light matter time with seventh dimension. It does not stop there. Remember the lamb himself, he has to speak through the bride, the unknown language. And this is this is the last acts everything and then away we go and then everything is done. But now this evening I'm to tell you that the bride has got the the great work to do. We have a a ministry and that ministry. It is just to surrender everything to God. Everything. Look at anything that can come between you and Christ. surrender it completely. Anything remember I told you you being in position it is greater than anything before God. That job God can take it away. The wife God can take her. He can take the children. He can allow the devil torment you for you to be in the position. And the more you linger, the heavy the judgment seal, the judgment seal, you see. So, we've got make a decision and leave our comfort zones and approach the king and we speak out. And now last time we were talking with brother Polycap and now we're saying that now you see the prophet he had the most complicated job to do because now he had to reveal the seals but in a way that the devil won't get it. the demons will not get it and he has to bring it in a way that the bride will catch the revelation and that's why you see he was not straight forward. He was never straight. He goes here and there and there he's on seventh seal brings the sixth. He goes all the place and he could keep saying that I believe you get it. The reason why he didn't bring it plain plainly. It's because God had already laid the pattern because it was hidden. first coming, the second coming also it is hidden still but revealed in a way that the bride will catch it. You see signs. So I pray that may the Lord give us grace and yesterday night I dreamt I was preaching but as I was preaching I was speaking to myself. I was preaching to myself, may God give us grace and we surrender everything that we have. Unless we do that, we shall not achieve what we are waiting for. In fact, we are waiting for ourselves. And now you may say now if I make a decision what about others you know revival starts with an individual just come to a place make a decision and wait and see. You see the fire can start with a sister here and goes over. I guarantee you that if you start the fire, it will not stop on you because how many wants to go to heaven because we have to go. Hallelujah. And the bride and the spirit they say come Lord. We are all waiting for him. Now as the musicians come, let me finish with this. You see, I talked about uh the dimension. And whenever anything bad happens, don't forget the solution that the Bible gives us. Always go to the knees. and pray to God and God will give you strength to go through it. Remember the the Hebrew children there had to first be the judgment seal upon them which caused them to make a decision. And still they stood for God. And when they were thrown into that fire, they saw the seventh, they saw the son of man. Hallelujah. Amen. And here the secret is that in that furnace, nothing hurt them. So relax. Nothing is going to hurt you. Nothing is going to hurt your soul because the lamb is in control of everything. As the pastor comes, my brother, you can sing that song after after I've prayed this short prayer. May we pray? Oh, dear heavenly father, king of glory, we thank you for your mercy. Lord, I'm weak in the body, but Lord, you I thank you that you have used me to deliver something. Lord, I pray that may our hearts burn within us and may our hearts yearn for something that we ought to have. Lord, King of Father, may you come and speak to our hearts. May you help us. We make that decision. We surrender everything. We surrender everything unto you because we see that we are waiting on ourselves. The Lord is waiting on us and the sleeping saints are also waiting on us. Oh Lord, what a ministry. May you help us to fulfill it. In the might name of Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. I surrender. I surrender. Oh. Ooh. I surrender. Oh. [Music] Oh. To thee, my lied, [Music] I surrender. One more time. I surrender. I surrender. I surrender, Lord. I surrender [Music] your Lord to thee my praise surrender. [Music] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. God bless you, saints. You know, there's that portion in the uh in the uh Laian church age. I think I don't I'm not too sure, but I think he read it. He's talking of the people under their messenger being the final voice to the final age. and that the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. Now he's speaking of the the church church national the denomination is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It is its own mouthpiece. So God is turning on her. He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her, in the church, in the bride. You know, we know that the messenger's voice is the is the voice of God. But you see, it doesn't stop there. Revelation 10 vers 7. Brother, if you give me that verse, it is speaking of the messenger, the prophet of our of our age in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. When he begins to sound, the mystery of God is finished. But then he doesn't stop there. Verses 8 to 11. Are you Are you following me? Is speaking of you, the bride, the church. You see this is about the angel vers seven we spoke on it on Sunday as well but then from vers 8 continue on all the way from to vers 11 I think. Yes. Come on brother give me the next verse. Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tong and kings. There is something that God is trying to do in our in our day to get us to realize what time we are living in. We are no longer in the church ages. We are being called out of there to a to a place where we take our place our position in Christ. Listen to this portion as before we we we give our offerings. It is the rising of the sun. All right? It says as Christ, now listen, as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth, although typed in many places. He was the first fruits of those that slept. He's now speaking of how Christ died in Christ. He was the first fruits of those that slept was the first and then he says in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church. There will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days. waving of the sheath. What was the sheath? The first one that come to mature. The first one that proved it was a wit. That proved it was a sheath. Praise the name of the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. Well, when Jesus rose again from the dead, it was only to show there are many who will rise again from the dead. And in the first resurrection when Jesus rose from the dead, we see there are many who actually physically in reality rose from the dead and at that time and he saw them. You remember they were on the streets of Jerusalem. We see it says in this bright coming of Christ there is another shift that has to be waved to prove it was whe to prove this is real and he says hallelujah I am sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism. There will be a message [Music] that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power, being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there. Praise the name of the Lord. Because I live, ye live also. Speaking to his wife. Because you live. Because I live, ye live also. What a resurrection that that was. And what a resurrection this is. To be quickened from the dead, to be made alive in Christ Jesus. By God's quickening power, he was waved to them. The word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost. The word made manifest. Yeah. The word made manifest. You know after brother Bham preached everything, he also manifested what he was talking about. And you know uh when he spoke the squirre into existence speaking it into existence. What voice was that? It was the voice of God in a man in our day in this bread coming of Christ. And then a fish dead speaks back life to me. God proving I'm I'm again here to prove that there is another group that is going to do exactly this. But you see he brother Bham was waved in this bright coming of Christ to show there are many more that are going to rise in the end time and will do the same thing. And you know the voice that cried to John, come up hither calling him out of the church ages pointing to the rapture. You know, as we know that there's a three-fold uh uh process shout. That is the message that comes through the seventh angel message voice that's going on now. How many are getting it? That's going on now. I want to say we are being called out to come from denominations to come to maturity and there is no way that is going to happen if you are still so looped with what others are doing. Let us focus on this message friends. Um I want to encourage you to read the message to listen to the message. There is a lot of things there. day we were brother polycap and my daughter we were at over sister uh gets Monica was there and you know if you want to take a seat for a moment that's okay and as we were sharing there and talking yeah it's okay musicians you can continue a little bit and uh you know we we we we we were just each of us was sharing what they were feeding on and brother pulled out a message from desperations and and you know put out something from the church ages to the seals and and oh my we had a wonderful time. Let me tell you if you are a believer and you are eating the message and you meet one another and you have been feeding on the message you you cannot just talk flat. Something is happening in the spiritual realm. Even when you come to church and the message is preached and you've been feeding on it, then your heart gets quickened. Don't worry about the small small things disturbing you in this life. Let us feed on the word. The more you feed on the word, the more you become the word and the more you realize your place in Christ. and things will begin to materialize. Amen. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Friends, I want to encourage you. Feed on the word. Feed on the word. Let us read the Bible every day. Let us listen to the message. If you can't read, you can listen. If if you can't listen to English, they are translated sermons really there are many ways now to listen to the message and then you realize something is being done in your life. Amen. And then these things you are hearing like what you have heard tonight can make sense to you. Amen. God bless you, brother Shem. Amen. Let's give a hand of praise to the Lord for for that sharing. Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe the deacons can bring the bags. We Let's pray over the offering and uh we'll be able to give.
