========================================

after the questions we will take in um some questions from the few people that will be here as well as for uh welcome to the bench I am pastori your host now today on the bench we are s uh sitting down with a man who despite a very hard and rough background he turned 200 naira that is about $400 into a multi-million dollar conglomerate one of the top most successful Africans in Africa and notice I said Africans in Africa I will pick more on that later is a believer of the enti message and a preacher of the Gospel now sir it's a honor to have you today and thousands of young people follow this program and will be impacted by your words of wisdom would would you please greet uh our audience God bless you Shalom bride of Christ around the world wherever you are in Africa listening to us we welcome you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ now everyone is interested in knowing who is Dr kosmas maduka and how did you arrive at your success I thought we should be begin with that well um brother cosas Med the way I usually would like to be addressed um I'm a Christian um a lot of people want to address me as um um a rich man or a wealthy man different form subject to where they met me and the way they know me but I love to be addressed as brother cosmas M and that's who I am I'm a Christian my Christian principles and value means so much to me um it's something that amazes a lot of people sometime they wonder and said oh brother you are too humble how do you get down to do things as I said please don't speak don't talk like that just understand that there is a different between a Christian that God bless with money and a rich man who became a Christian so I am a Christian who God blessed with money I am not a rich man who become a Christian amen amen well uh that is very very interesting because notable for Africa not only uh the Africans that have been successful here but also those who live abroad I've met quite a few and you will notice that even the other brothers will say Well when black people get money they kind of behave in a indifferent and so to find someone that God has blessed and he recognizes that they a Christian before they a successful person to me I think that is something of not uh that many uh of young people can learn from thank you um then the other question the other part of the question was uh maybe we can give you a little time to you know narrate and not only narrate but also tell our young people how you arrived here because the reason why I ask this question is we have a lot of get rich quick schemes sure and brother bam talked about that and many young people think that they can arrive at wealth in just a blink of an eye you know invest you know one you know one naira or one sh Shillings and get 500 million in in an overnight yeah so how how was this possible for you okay you know um my story sometime I thought it could have been balling to a lot of people because I have just simple one story that I've repeatedly you know tell around the world um but as an individual I believe our story is somewhat unique unique in the sense that um um um I am a manifestation of the grace of God as an individual MH uh because um um when you people sing that hymn from grass to riches he took a beggar and make him a king I've never listen to that song without breaking down tears coming from my eyes MH because that song Tell My Story absolutely my story um I live to in my generation I just think God raised me up to show people that there is no mountain that is insurmountable there's no hair that is too high to Crime William Braham the prophet of this age let us know that it is our attitude yes that brings the result mhm um and he said that from experience he didn't just said that off his head mhm but was gifted he was a messenger and a prophet for a generation but he never closed his leg and sit back and said because I am a messenger I am called for this uh uh generation God will just download all informations from my head but you could still see him really committed to his call yes what I try to tell young people is to pursue purpose and life yes if you pursue purpose every other 10 will add to it m and what is purpose M purpose is the reason why purpose is why you exist purpose is why things is made and the things that are made 90% Almost 100% of the time don't know its purpose the purpose is only in the mind of the mea the manufacturer if you ask this bottle of water why were you made he will not answer you he didn't know yeah but if you ask the person who made it he will tell you this is made for refreshment you can drink it is water if you ask this chair this where were you made he did not know so if you want to know you ask the maker mhm so who is the maker of human being God God so if you don't understand your purpose of existence that's the reason why you need to go to God exactly because the manufacturer build success in everything that is made but a lot of people try to approach Life by presuming MH if you do not understand purpose M abuse will be inevitable if I don't know that this was made as a table M to hold laptop to hold water I can decide to stand on it I may think it's uh um I I think that uh it's a standing uh I can sit on it if I'm sitting on this or standing on it I'm abusing it exactly and why am I abusing it because I did not know the purpose for which it is made yeah so if it doesn't serve his purpose M then abuse will become inevitable m many people abused their life because they did not know the purpose of their existence now let me back up I was born to one loin that's my mother's name and my father's name is Peter maduk uh 65 years ago um within the four years of my existence onto the Earth my father went to be with the Lord I was a young man who do not know my left or right put your eyes in the mind of a four years baby mhm um the generation I grew up with those days you have to fake sickness to be able to eat rice rice used to be a delicacy a special food and uh only you can only get it if not for a festival you need to really be sick and refuse to eat other food and they ask you can't we find you something to eat what will you eat then you say rice but there was this particular day that everybody was kind to me I ate rice more than five times or eight times anybody pass what you eat rice and I was saying oh my God what a wonderful day this kind of day should never end and uh I I you know some people are come trooping into our house it was like a festival you know and uh um maset were coming people were beating music and things but I saw my mother unlike the rest of everybody feeling happy on the one corner of the wall her hair scattered she was crying and I was asking I was making her angry everybody is Happy why is she uh unhappy L little did I know that that was the funeral of my father but I saw my father in a black suit with a white on a bow tie lying on a bed so I thought he was taking a nap H I didn't know what it is but letter in my life that's the best I can say I knew my father so life was rough uh gave me no opportunity to survive or become anything in life um it was really really difficult but I still respect a lot of Godly women uh William Braham the prophet of this age told us that a Godly mother is the first pastor of the house yes and that the New Testament has four book and the mother is the Fifth Gospel oh um I can truly say I experienced that with my mother my mother was not a Pentecostal or a message person but was a devoted Catholic and really you know she was committed to her belief mhm and um if you ask me to say I would say created the hunger of God in Me because she wakes us up when I was in that age early morning by 5:00 for morning devotion and we had to pray Catholic Rosary you know in Our Father who is in heaven you know after that we say hell Mary full of grace 10 times repeatedly and that was where initially it was difficult but like everything in life practice makes perfect yes and the more you do things the more you get accustomed to it and you love it I saw my mother pray all night really Desiring for God because life was unfair to her she was at tender age her husband went to be with the Lord and he has four kids to take care of so she doesn't have anybody but God and introduce try to introduce this God to us when I was too young so many time we wake up and we feeling sleepy sometime he will use her five pums on our botom to wake us up or any of us feeling sleepy if you that sleep never left you she has a cup of water she emptied it in your head that was the worst that I almost hate God for that one I just said what kind of God is this that this cold water come on your head ear in the morning then sleep will disappear but that was how she knew that's the best she knew she has good intention so from then when I started growing up I wasn't waiting for my mother again to lead me for prayer I started praying on my own you know started having hunger and desire for god um we were Catholics that's our background um um I became an alter boy yes I was an alter boy you know I was a mass servant you know try everything I can but again if the way to live a life is to be honest yes if there's anything even till today when I talk to Believers I said if there's one thing God want us to bring on the table yes it's our honest of purpose forget your mistake forget about anything because you are human being but will you be honest to own up not looking for anybody to hold you in your Adam's ample to get you to accept when you are wrong exactly God required that depth of sincerity sinc and if there's anything that set William Braham has apart from his contemporary was that level of depth of sincerity in approach to God yeah because he knew you can't fool God you can fool a man but you can't fool God so if you can approach god with that attitude of depth of sincerity the sky is your limit yeah in fact you won't have limit because what William BL told us that a man or a woman that completely surrender his heart to God is an omin poent when God can get you to a point you have no reservation you truly want to empty out and let him come in then he can use you you because the the number one enemy you have is not your husband it's not your wife it's not your uncle it's not your children it's not your father he yourself exactly so if you can get yourself out of the way mhm then God will have his way in your life yeah so while you continue sorry to interrupt you you spoke of of your mother so it all whenever I hear you tell this story it really reminds me of my mother and you know most of the people that are listening to us a young people as I told you of this and we see that uh the younger generation the women no longer want to uh be women and they no longer want to be wives and take care of children and train them and raise them in the fear of God but if um a Catholic mother can be able to do that and instill the fear of God in you how much more a believing woman can do well I think a believing woman should do much better uh in every sense because we were once like half spiritual Amia but when we came into this message this end time message God sent William Braham to reveal the heart of God to us yeah so we we are like having an open book we are not gazing Stars anymore we are not supposed to be speculating we are not nois we should know better nobody I've never heard it from anybody that mother is the first pastor of the house I never heard it from anybody that that the gospel had fif gospel and mother should occupy that place so B had used different words to show us how important a mother is exactly because most of the problem we have today Frankly Speaking is not child delinquent many parent are delc it's parent deliquency that we are going through there is no authority figure go in the house anymore people are not properly guided how they should live and the love the the parents need to show to their children to be able to you know take them on but let me say that many people can use this as excuse to their life why they are not important but if you think that is excuse I can also have good excuse because part of the excuse is that I didn't have father care Over Me growing up so at the end of the day we are individually responsible for the choices we made many time we don't like it because we like to abrigate responsibility looking for who to blame why we are not who we are supposed to be MH but heart statement the truth is that every one of us is a sum total of choices we have made in life that's right that's right okay many time we don't acknowledge or appreciate it one wrong choice doesn't make you a failure MH one right choice doesn't make you successful M it's a it's a constant some total M of wrong choices you made over a period of time yeah you become a failure it's a su total of right choices you made over a period of time that make you successful yeah because nobody would say he had never made a mistake so the choices we make really matter exactly the choices we met in life make at the end of the day we are some total of the church choices we made and but a lot of people wonder how can I be successful yeah I believe this is my personal belief that success is predictable yeah okay and failure is also predictable okay because everything a manufacturer build he build success into it mhm so there is a law our success as human beings is good for God MH God want us to succeed every one of us God never build any of us to be a failure that's right but whether we succeed or fail m is up to us mhm I have had I've discussed with some young people and quite a number of times some of them told me where is the place of Grace in this thing I'm saying that I am too hard on them where is the place of Grace I said please listen carefully so that you can understand and appreciate it and they're listening and they listening I said Grace is an enablement but Grace is not disgrace okay if you read the scripture God told Joshua in Joshua Chapter 1:7 this book of law shall not depart from your mouth you shall meditate in it not only in the night not only in the day day and night then he say for D shall thou be successful there are conditions that is tied to it you don't just only meditate on the book but you you said that you should observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou then shall th make thyself not your uncle not your brother not your sister not then shall thou make thyself prosperous so I then explained to some young people I said look many of you don't understand Destiny mhm I go to different church and I hear them sing a song Destiny changer come and change my destiny destiny today come and change my destiny destiny today I said when they get to that Destiny changer I keep quiet they asked me why did I keep quiet I said I don't want my change I love my destiny why am I CH you need your own change pray for it to be changed I don't want my own change I said let me tell you my understanding a little way for you to appreciate Destiny Okay I said if you are born in a rich man family yeah and you want to be a doctor M if that's your desire mm M and your father can pay your school fees to be a doctor you are destined to be a doctor a doctor but whether in real life you become a doctor or not is up to you mhm they say how I said because if you want to be a doctor this is a a a discussion you need to have by yourself you can't be a doctor because you say I want to I want to mhm you need to have self conversation MH I want to be a doctor you ask your you you you have discussion with yourself how mhm nobody become a doctor by mouth I want to that's right I want to doesn't make you a doctor so when you make that discussion self conversation I want to be a doctor you ask yourself how you answer the question it's a conversation you're having with yourself to be a doctor I need to be good in five science subject MH you are beginning okay I need to be good in math MH extra math English biology chemistry beautiful you are not good at it but you have identified them you are making progress exactly the the next thing is that can I get a doctor can I get a teacher who will teach me marks who will teach me English MH and you find out that these subjects are sometime things that frightens you but there's no fear in it if you get a good coach he will Coach you and before you know it you start exploiting this subject they become very easy for you mhm 6 years or eight from that day you become a doctor mhm if you are willing to learn and your father has the money to pay for your school exactly but if your father PID for your school and you went go to school and become a rain gate run around with boys or girls in 6 years you will not graduate exactly and if your father go and bribe the teacher to graduate you for you to begin to kill human being as a doctor is the worst thing he could do to you and to do to his other fellow human being so if you don't agraduate you need to rewrite that class again and there as time it will reach they will expire you from that school if because if you feel you you don't have ability to to to retain what you are learning to put it into practice M so so the choices you make really matter really matter they make you they make you so I told the man I said look there are two smart young people who thought they were very crev and they know everything and in their Village there was an elderly man who is very intelligent highly respected because he can decode anything for you and these two smart smart young man decided we're going to make full out of this man we're going to he think he's smart will show him so they went and got a small B and hid it behind them and get to the Ancient Man and said there is a mystery we want you to decode to us the man said go ahead he said we had a small bed in our back and we want you to tell us whether this bed is alive or dead dead they've already decided if the man said the bed is alive they will squeeze the bed and die die then they will show him a dead bed if the man said the bed is a de he a dead they will show him the bed that he's alive so they met the anent man and said can you please explain I told them I said this is what Destiny is up about can you explain whether this bird is life or dead the ancient man said it's not a problem whether this bird is alive or dead is up to you uhhuh that was the question in other words if you like kill the bird or you like keep it alive the question he gave them he said you want to know whether this bir is alive or dead my answer is that it's up to you it's your choice it's your choice you decide whether you want to keep him alive or kill him so this is what Destiny is all about God had made a provision for every one of us because when he write his vision statement pering human being in Genesis 1:26 he was not under any illusion he said let me make a man mhm in my own likeness after my own kind the way he was is what he wanted to make man mhm so God created a man from beginning to be a Creator MH that's why he didn't even put on that wear for the man when he created him he didn't give him a table he didn't give him a she he didn't give him a cow why because God wanted man to create it to to be part of his creation M he took this table and H it on the tree he took this year kept it on the tree he took automobile keep it on the the team o and the in the mountain the only thing God gave his children which is still what we are fighting for God never gave a man car he didn't give him a shoe mhm he HD it on the cow MH but he gave it sense to be able to get the things out of what is created to be able to recreate the only thing God gave man is land mhm is That's Why They Call property real estate is the only estate that is real yeah that's why that's why they are still fighting in pistan today over land over every problem of the world is land property that is the only thing God gave to his children yeah and I told some of the young believers who once they get the first money the first thing he bought a car the next one is's looking for I said car is not wealth Bible say a righteous man liveth wealth for his children children children if you can't put money in a property and die your child cannot herit your car if you don't have land you have not left any you because if you want to be a righteous man you follow God's principle MH a righteous man liveth weal for his children so the only estate that is real is property so when you start making money invest in property MH so that you can live inheritance for your children don't just buy car buy nice suit and these are not inheritance for anybody so God didn't give a man a cloth but he left the cloth on the wool it's a man's responsibility to think outside of the boss to activate his blame to take the wool and be able to make a clo but the land you cannot make M God gave that to you m but every other thing it is given in your own power to be able to make so let me continue with my story when I grew up as a young man I have an inquisitive mind m i i because so were you at a place when you an alter boy and yes an Al Boy you know God gave us 5 billion cells in our brain average human being use 10% of it if you get to 12% of it you will become a genius there are every that's why William Braham said everything we require to the resurrection is already in us it's not coming it's already there that's right we only need people who can teach us Faith to ATT activate those things and be able to get to our advancement M because my mother had taught me how to pray I heard that Mary visited three children at Fatima they told us this story in Catholic M I went to the bush to pray at the age of seven and I was talking to Mary I said I Le you going to Fatima you can come to n you can come to my Village I want to see you you know P told us about that little child that when the Thunder were um blasing the child was crying and the mother came to the child and said don't worry you know God is with you he said Mom I want god with flesh so I want god with flesh I need I needed I didn't want historical God I wanted to feel God I went to the bush I prayed I didn't see Mary but that didn't stop that hunger of God in Me yeah because if there's a deep calling in your heart there is a deep somewhere to respond for it there's nothing you are taxing for that God has not provided M but the things start from Hunger mhm you can never feed a man a woman who is hungry and you can never teach anybody to be hungry hunger is something that comes naturally naturally so if you don't if somebody is not hungry you are giving him food you are wasting time he had to show that he's hungry and that's how it is so that's why I'm saying everything about us M it's about choices M as I I think um in a message I think it's as I was with Moses B said that 10 years from today you can be an asset to the society but 10 years to today you may be cleaning bathroom because of the choices you make today so our choices matters at the end of the day we are some total life never gave me opportunity but I choose that I will be different I choose I will not be like the rest of the other boys I choose I will not go the popular way every other person is going this was my choice MH we were my had us we are three boys and a girl the girl is my senior brother senior me and they had a we had a we are first three boys and then a girl MH but I was different from all of them not because I have better sense of them but I this my inquisitiveness of trying to know was what led me to my Christian fith because I have this desire my mother had had taught me that there is God and when I was 4 years old she looked me into the eyes and told me to believe in myself mhm and to believe in God MH and that I will go places in life and that it would be difficult for people to say no to me MH at that innocent mind I believe everything my mother told me mhm and I I I practice it in my life MH that's why in Genesis the first thing God did to his son is that he blessed them and then after he blessed them he gave them five strategic means to be able to be like him mhm dominate subdue control you know so rule this Earth for him when you apply those principle the there is nothing that could stop you because so there is a a a a a law of success built on every product M once you obey that success you will get the result take for instance I'm speaking with Dynamic phone uh mic okay this mic that I'm speaking has a battery inside yeah so this microphone do not want battery battery it needs battery to be able to function to be able to function so so battery is not a want but if you remove battery from this microphone and you decide to speak in tongue so that you can start speaking you can fast for 40 days days nothing will happen it will not work so you need to obey the law of the manufacturer first of all and the law of manufacturer is to give it battery yeah if you give it battery it will function yeah if you take put battery on it if you like to pray pray that's if you don't like to pray that's up to you but don't do any other thing without giving it battery because battery is a that makes it function so the need for battery is built on it by the manufacturer and so you find a lot of young people they are not willing to do what they they ought to do actually what they advised to do but they think that prayer is going to make it like magical that's that is what religious religion has done to people okay because that's not Christianity yeah Christianity also teach you that uh ecclesiastic 9 whatever you find yourself to do do it with all your might with all your soul with all your ability and that's why our Prophet also taught us yes what whatever you want to do be the best out of it even if you make up your mind to be a criminal be the best criminal not a mediocre don't don't come halfway on it that's that's the attitude so and if you want to be a Christian be a good kind of Christian don't be Halfway Christian you know become an incubator chicken Christian people must follow you up call you every time to come to church chur throw yourself into it yeah amen that's right when BR prayed about his sick situation and was asking God he said God if I die I will come to heaven and I will tell you I trusted you and I died MH so what does that mean he believed God with all his heart with no reservation M so I had it attitude why I why I make this story is that so you can we can go back to the prophet word when John just speak he speak by inspiration yes that is our attitude that bring result exactly but many of us is that we are living in a generation of irresponsibility where people want to um nobody want to accept responsibility people just want to abortion blame transfer responsibility to other people you don't have good reason to explain why they didn't do anything believing that that reason is enough no reason actually people don't know the war the word poor is not about people who lack mhm check your W poor means unproductive MH the word poor is not about people who lack things people that are referred to poor people and people who are not productive when you are not productive then the word poor is refer is is referred to you exactly so God created a man to be a manager mhm God created a man to work MH if you read your Bible Genesis 1 after Genesis 1 to the end then Genesis 2 was application of Genesis 1 Genesis 2:4 said the eight was filled with rock no Beauty nothing nothing is functional MH because why there was no human being MH man was the motivation of beauty MH until God created man then water came from the ground then Garden was developed so the first thing God did is he took a man he made him Genesis 2:15 and put him in the garden and said cultivate it dress it make it beautiful protect it m so man was made to walk this is before fall this is before the fall so walk is not a c yeah but many of us do not know the difference between work and a job M because I believe they look like the same but they are not exactly the same yeah M okay your job is what they pay you for what you do M but your work is what you are born to do MH your job can never make you wealthy MH it has limitation in making you wealthy what makes you wealthy is your work MH you go to your job to learn your work mhm when you go to your job in the morning you come back in the evening and start practicing your job your your work M because job in job they pay you salary M salary is a medicine for poverty but it doesn't cure it so is there a connection between work and purpose that is a work is actually purpose exactly work is actually purpose the reason actually you can call it devotion the reason why you were born if you find it that is purpose a natural word even establishments that are purposely driven are much more successful than the ones that are profit driven if you pursue purpose M you will achieve success because when you fulfill purpose this is the reason why you are created and that's why people everybody must not be a doctor everybody must not be a lawyer every if God call you to to to sink just go there and sing like and actually you stop walking when you find your purpose yeah when you operate in your purpose you don't do it with any stress yeah because it's like fish to water yeah yes when fish is swimming it's walking but it's wind doesn't pain him when bed is flying he's walking but his wind also never pain him so when you find your purpose of existence you stop working you is something you love to do and by doing it the result will be so evident because you are in your purpose of life yeah it just comes natural it come natural so when I tried all of those things it was life was rough and hard tough difficult because this was before Nigerian civil war which year are we talking about here we are talking about like 19 uh Nigerian civil war broke out uh I think 196 62 or 63 I'm not very sure but Nigeria had this independent in 1960 it wasn't long soon after that I think by 65 or the the the civil war broke out okay and I was still a young man you know little boy uh you know you it's something you don't wish for anybody to see where you see jet fighter come dropping bomb in people's house we run under the bunker people could not go to farm to fish we have to it's about survival we at every anything that is moving to be able to to leave but I have sheer determination that if there's one person that will be alive and survive so it's all about determination we made in ourself that's why when I teach principle I tell people the first thing you need to bring on the table with God is desire MH you must have desire mhm because your desire is like your egg mhm the jam the seed come from God but that seed will not fall on anything if a woman make love with her husband if she doesn't drop egg she can make love as many time as possible nothing thing will germinate those egg will die so the egg has to be there for the seed to come into it and you see life is created so that desire will be there so and that's why Jesus in Mark 11:24 say whatever you desire you believe you receive it and you will have it so desire it come first then the the promise come on it so you need to have that and that desire is what I call hunger and we have a we have an issue here uh I've seen it myself and many have actually even told to me directly when young people desire things let's say big things or they want to achieve certain things in life our society you know we just people would take will talk words to you they say well you're over ambitious you're overly ambitious you're proud you know instead of encouraging and many young people just then just stay back and you know and leave everything to Fed okay so that is the um that is um very important uh point you have made there but I would like us to balance it and what do I mean by I want us to balance it the reality is that the way God want us to live even though we are adult is to live like little children a little child do not know fear God want us to live a Fearless life we are not born with fear we learn fear fear is something we learn as we grow up if you find a child in his innocent level and I I actually tell parents today I teach people if you really want to know naturally who your child is wash him from the age of two to five if that child is a born Chef he will go to the sand I'm putting sand together to make like he's cooking if he's a born um doctor you will see him taking something putting in Pur because what he is is manifesting naturally because that's what he was born to be by the time he's getting to the age of8 or nine his father is a lawyer his father said go to school and learn law you can make money from law all these things doesn't make money then the boy the father decided to live his life through his own child the boy will go and learn law law but he will never win any case in the court because anytime they say something he's looking for book he never get inspiration nothing speak back to him only book he s forc him to become a a doctor because his father is a doctor because you're a doctor your son must be a doctor it doesn't work like that yeah you fish can never climb a tree yeah are you feel what I'm saying yes so allow the children to grow naturally parents many time are dream Killers we parents kill the dreams of our children but the truth also is that if you many time it's a diff a it's really a difficult thing to explain but I told people problem many times is opportunity in life because the word crisis in Chinese language actually means opportunity when you talk about crisis in China m not like in the direct interpretation of crisis in China is opportunity okay you can Google it aming you can Google it so anything you think is an obstacle m is an opportunity mhm if my father is alive I did not believe my father could have allowed me to do some of the things I did MH at my te age that brought me to where I am M so my father's death supposed to be a hindrance but I turned it into opportunity opportunity I knew there are things my children wanted to do that I stopped them my last boy wanted to drive motorbike I said please stop that you break your leg you you cannot do that what stop stop but I drove motorbike at the age of 11 I was not 12 when I drove motorbike yeah my only son who drive motorbike out of my four boy is the one who disobeyed me [Laughter] are you get are you get what is yes but today both of us go out to go and ride bike and you enjoy together yeah we we I'm a biker I have BMW 1,600 so he has Suzuki uh 1,300 we go out now and rode bike and we are the only two people that rode bike in my family but he's able to ride back by disobedient many time you will never find Road without missing road yeah that's right if you keep on following a road that has been taught to you you will not discover new road that's right so you need sometime you need to miss road yeah you may get to the end and you find out there's no Road there you come back it's experience yeah you've gained experience and people ask me why do you say this thing don't you know this thing will confuse young people I said life is not about what all that you are taught you must have inspiration mhm if my father was alive he would never allow me to marry under 20 years H because it's it's not in our tradition so I break tradition for you to do something new you break tradition mhm William Braham did not force himself to see he was born a SE mhm and his brethren in Baptist Church said this is devil you can't what do you say you see because we don't see here what do you say you are seeing we don't believe any such thing you don't believe such thing stop it and he kned down start praying God I don't want evil spirit please take this away from me but the gift and calling of God is without repentance so he couldn't do anything about it so if you are I'm too guided micromanaging people you don't get to see the people fully actualize themselves so sometime we must also allow our young people to make their mistakes because that's part of learning nobody get up one day and say I'm working the way to get to work is you fall how many times no what your daddy is interested is that you are making a to stand up it's not counting you have fall first you have fall the second one you have fall at the thir time no what you are seeing is that that baby is making every effort to cor you never challenge him why did he fall provided he keep on making effort to get up one day his leg will become strong yeah but any baby that were born he said I'm going to sit here I don't want anybody to laugh at me the day my leg is strong I get up to walk he will become a a l person will never walk yeah the process of walking is buil in in rising and falling yeah so people who are so conscious of making mistake never amount to anything in life that's right that's very powerful yeah the prophet supported it he said anybody who do not want have IR Reser the man said I want to work for you but he said why you said don't make mistake but said that person you you don't need him because you will be too careful mhm you will never dare anything in life yeah the correct thing is to have desire to be right your desire was not be to make a mistake but will you make a mistake you must make a mistake that because that's how you learn the development and processes of learning come from mistake M so if you go one way and find that there's no Road there you won't go there again but if you want to be very careful so when that child is growing up the child is so innocent he believes in anything is possible he has no fear if you have a little socket here he will put his hand inside you say it's childish yes it's childish but that is fear that that is that is expression of Freedom how God want us to live if you if a if a serpent is here he doesn't know serpent he go he grab the serpent and St it into his mouth if you leave the baby you have no erter here he's clamming this tap before this boy will follow the angel of God is guiding that child yeah it's not you God has a protection if parents see the things their children did when they were trying to you see the child start to walk it's going like Bree is blowing him you know you almost break his head but through all of those things his leg start getting strong at that tenter age the boy said that buy me something when you are coming back he said what do you want I want a plane the boy said that will buy me a plane he go to his friend and said Daddy is buying me a plane tomorrow I'll show you he go to the person buy got and if the daddy came come back he will go and ask his daddy where's my Aeroplane you know why asking because he believe that his daddy will buy him a plane yeah Jesus said we should be like those children many of us don't believe God and we never go back to go and ask we don't pray with sincerity because we because only expect if you are looking for anything you have to be under expectation yeah that's right and brother BR say you will never live above your confession confession when you believe things you begin to confess it people say many things about me before I have $1,000 before I knew what $500 was on my honor I told people I would with the US dollar millionaire H and people were laughing at me we are too conscious what what happen if I say this thing and it doesn't happen what happen if I say it it doesn't happen because we our s ego is cheating us because we don't want to be laughed at they want we want to be look like we're very responsible but that's where we expose oursel in our foolishness to trust c means I've told them yesterday some people ask me is your head correct I told them I don't know about my head I know about my heart my heart is correct what my head I don't know about it but I meant well my desire is correct that I know because I never desire to do anything wrong wrong yeah can I do wrong yes I can because I'm human being yeah but it's not in my desire to do wrong that's right so I'm not I don't worry about my head I worry about my my heart it's what my heart is telling me is what is matter to me but in my head I can make mistake and that's why you you need to watch me over a period of the time and see how I'm threat telling to know whether I'm consistent in the things I'm doing then you know truly whether you can bet on this person or you can trust this person so that way those little children live is the way we're supposed to live and that's why the prophet said don't promise your child something you will not do because the children will think this is how God is that he make empty promises so he wanted us to learn in teaching children because that innocent heart those children have is what we are supposed to have and that is how we are supposed to live in life to be under expectation that whatever God promised us will happen and then we walk towards it now at certain age your dad will said I'm going to buy you Aeroplane but before I come back I want to make sure you have finished your homework mhm you see engagement has become he's teaching that child now how to take responsibility yes now you will not expect that you will not do your homework and expect me to give you the rlan is that correct because when God took the children of Israel he gave their their true never wore out yeah in the wilderness yeah their cloth never wore out they have breakfast they have dinner and God tell them I have a place I'm taking you Kenna Promised Land M where there is honey where there is this once they enter Canan man hased God said this is the time for management M no free food m h this is it's time for management yeah take your sword War Drive out all these Anarchist in your mountains oh the people said is this one chance uh promise we thought when we enter here everything is already done for us we pick them on the street the land is Flowing with milk and honey honey but that is the training so withness was was was God what God does for you in real life there are a situation where of Independence independency where you are depending on people to do everything to you there are about three or four faces of your life you get to the point now where nobody makes decisions for you you begin to make that decision so that's people need to grow and follow that process because that's how God put everything in life so if we follow that God guarantee he built in every one of us success M but that success will come by obedience let me give you one final analogy then we go to another point the man that makes this phone buil success on this phone M but he didn't give you this phone without manual when you buy phone you see a packet before you get to the phone there are about three or four books one is a diagram which is image you will see first the second thing is a book called warranty the third thing is a manual they hit this phone before you reach to the phone they have expected you to have gone through all of those things before you pick phone before you open it up if you have gone through all of them by the time you have this phone you know how to command this phone to deliver to you the success the man built on the phone MH do you know that I've carried this Apple phone for years I didn't know I can be speaking and this phone will be typing the things that I'm saying because I didn't read the man read the manual what I knew is that this phone can I can receive call and they can send call I can receive email I was in I was in tunisha last last year I was doing something with the man said what is this you are doing I said I'm trying to send me to the children said you are taking too much time he said can I have your phone I open my phone he play something okay say what you are saying I said Junior I've been trying to reach you this my phone started tying I scream put my by the time I say you finish I said send I press button the thing go I said is this what my children are doing before I finish sending the mail they they and I'm wondering how they doing this thing so the next time now my son had just sent mail I play the I said junior thank you very much I understand the things you said God bless you P the thing don't go this phone can recognize your voice and type not voicemail typing but I've carried this phone for 15 years I didn't have never used that function because you did not read the because I did not read the manual and I couldn't make the command on the phone the phone has the potential the ability MH but I need to command the phone mhm so even in the New Age we are going into the AI age mhm what is most important today MH in artificial intelligence MH the colc colum in school has to change because you need if you don't ask the right question MH that human machine will not give you the right correct answer mhm you must know the right command by answering the right question for it to respond to you appropriately so the manual for life is Bible the word of God many of us don't read it and we want to result and that's why we never get result and that's a big problem most of the unbelievers that are successful follow laws that are in the Bible they don't give credit to God they said the universe the universe said this they said they call it Universe they give it any other name so you don't tag them religion all those principle they have used to survive back the origin of it is from the word of God yeah but they don't give credit to God they call it universe so that they don't call them F religious Fanatics yes when they want to talk about Jesus they tell you the wise man they don't say Jesus certainly the wise man give Talent he would say Jesus so that people don't quarrel them yeah they are ashamed but they take those principles and they use them apply them they they apply them and get result so one of the things that helped me is that I became a Christian very early in my life and I think that's what set me apart from my contemporaries MH before I turned 15 I made a commitment to Christ M and I read Bible back to back I follow every principle that I find in the word of God and I apply them in my life and people look at me like I'm a and that I'm a ex extraordinary I'm ordinary person like every one of them because I am not the person that brings result if you follow Jesus in Matthew chapter 16 say I will give you the keys m not one key plural Keys of the Kingdom of [Music] God you guys are located in area of hotel if somebody give you the bunch of the keys of this place and don't show you the very key for this door you can there in this door for 2 hours yeah looking for the right key even you have the key sometime you app it you me small resistance you remove it and you are going around the circle but the man that knows the key just turned the key around he took the right key he put it if the if he push it a little bit the door open and you ask yourself is it the same key that I'm using that this man Ed he applied it with confidence because you know this is the right key by the time you are figing with the key so it makes you feel like this person is extraordinary no he's not because it's the keys that are opening the door so the keys are in the word of God for everything we do many of us want Prosperity M but we do not know the key for Prosperity is not only prayer mhm and many of us fast for 40 days 40 night doing nothing praying mhm nothing will happen M if you do not take a step of faith exactly God asks Moses what is that thing that is in your hand mhm you need to follow this principle because a seed have a law built in a seed mhm if you put a seed on this table if it's not hybrid seed it's an in seed the life that is in that seed is Perpetual but he need the condition to function if you leave it on this table you speak in tongue you pray you fast nothing will happen nothing happens but if you follow the law and get a a land where there is must where there is sun and you prepare the ground you put that seed if you like pray if you don't like don't pray that seed will grow exactly because the law that is in the seed become effective when you get to the ground but if you take the same seed and get hot sand and put it inside the hot sand you circumvent the life that is in the seed it will not grow because you did not follow the law so obedience to law guarantees success success so then you have taken us on the on your journey and of course you did speak about uh what your mother did and her contribution towards that uh but then again you've been talking about life choices and and the choices really make make us what we will become in the future and one of the most important choices you've made that you've been speaking of for the past few minutes is that you decided to be a Christian that's correct and that uh this can we then say that this has been the basis of what you are today absolutely I was 15 living like I am 1550 I was 14 living 140 Christianity gets you to level of maturity beyond your contemporary because the word of God opens to you you see your full potentials you see all that is possible because if you make that decision yourself but if you follow your daddy to church you don't that doesn't mean you a because you've not made a commitment I'm talking about you making a commitment and decision that I'm following Christ it become your own choice that even your father say I don't follow anymore you you don't follow your father you now follow so because St John 1 verse 12 said as many as receive Christ are given power to become the children of God which were born not after the will of man man not after the will of Flesh this born the the born your father or mother born you has been cancelled you are now regenerated you have a new father and you begin to live for him at that point if your natural father said this thing doesn't make sense you say God bless you but because it makes sense to me and so then you had many friends who were your age at the time but then because you of the decision you had taken to follow Jesus Christ it rearranged everything that you were doing started doing it different because when you become a Christian the first thing it does to you is it gives you Vision yeah vision is an Insight yeah you can be in this room four corner wall but you can see beyond this room Yeah by your by your eye mind yeah your inner mind it's not just your physical side that controls you anymore yeah so that Vision create a picture in your mind of your destination yeah it's a journey of a voyage yeah you may not know all the route that will take you there but the end of it you must see it yeah because that will be the motivation that makes you wake up every morning Christian gives you Vision this is where I am going and that thing drives you in everything you do yeah so and that tender age before I turned 15 nobody told me to do that but I've learned Prin disciples from the word of God habakuk 220 if you have a vision write it down yeah don't just say it's a vision many people tell you they have a vision ask them what is the vision they don't know did you see Jesus Christ asking people what would you that I do for you even a blind man he ask him the question the BL man would have said are you blind also but it's assumption you may think a blind man want to see it's assumption for some people it's a virtue yeah it's opportunity to beg yeah that is their [Laughter] business not all of them are blind as we suppose they are even the ones that are really blind there are some of them who think this has God gave me this to be with who I am they are content with it because that's a source of income yeah so Jesus will ask the blind man what will you that I do for you then the blind man said that I might receive my sight and Jesus said your eyes open he never Force anything on anybody yeah so he asks you that's why I'm talking about desire yeah you must desire that thing you desire is what God will do for you because you bring your desire under subjection to his will but so when you have Vision which is plan write it down so I was 15 when I wrote five things I want to accomplish before 25 Yeah by 18 I want to live in three bedrooms apartment of my own number one by 20 I want to take a lady to altar a wife get married number two by 21 I want to have a son not a child a son I wrote a song by 23 I want to have my UNC number four my 25 I want to be a mirian wow I didn't just I wrote them down wrote it in a boat and put it in the wall of my bed so in the morning I go out when I come back I come back here after I pray I look at this from beginning to the end internalize it into my system then I go to my bed I sleep when I'm sleeping I'm dreaming about those things because these are the things that dominate my spirit Romans chapter 6 said know you not that to whom you y yourself servant to oby his servant you are whether of sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness yeah in the morning I pray after I pray before I step out I go back there I look at all of those five things so when I am walking in the street you are talking to me you don't know the way my head is walking MH I'm listening to you looking at you and what my head is telling me is there anything this guy can offer me is there a way he can help me reach this place if there is no if I see from everything you are doing you cannot support this dream I cut you off yeah because you are a distraction you chose the people you relate with you have a vision you choose your friends yeah you don't even get to the Bookshop and looking for book to before you get to the book you know exactly the book because you are looking for everything that support yeah that thing where you are going that's why vision is the first thing that happen in the life of people for them to get the result MH when you write your vision then you write your mission yeah how to be able to so this thing was my driving force people criticize me people say I'm too proud some people say I'm too arrogant people qualify me with all kind of qualification I know I have a good heart but I have a purpose something is driving me that I want to accomplish and I didn't want a distraction MH if you're a young girl and I'm moving with you you ask me for sex I cut you off because un wanted child cannot take me to this place so I was possessed almost like a mad person because this is where I'm going and each year I can come back and ask myself where am I to where I want to be this is part of the reason of writing this down because it drives you it help you hold yourself accountable every year and see what have I done to move me from point A to B you know this thing is so serious that some people don't understand it by 18 years I was living in three bedrooms apartment of my own my senior brother is still living with my mother MH I left home I had my own house because I have plans by 19 18 I started talking to a girl in church to marry mhm and I took her to alar on September 23rd 1978 I would turn 20 on December 24th that year I beat it with by four months I was married at 19 years years plus MH of course I made love to my wife expecting a baby in 21 because that's what I expect to have but God knew that these two baby cannot be making baby shut the wom so that they can get their ass together I pursue my other dream yeah I wanted a car by 23 I got it at 22 yes I wanted to be a millioner by 25 I got it by 24 I made my first $2 million at 24 years not naira not naira dollars dollars at 24 24 years huh 24 years yes till today where I am living that is my home that I still live is a house I built when I was 25 years there is a part that you left out and I know that it might impact some people here uh that are listening to us uh you got the 400 your first income I'll come I'll come back to it that's that's really my that that's I'll come back to it I didn't forget it but I'm I'm building the story because that was my beginning because of the death of my father my mother couldn't support me he was supporting my senior brother so I went to live with his parents my grandparents mhm so I learn industrial I became industrious at very tender age of my life mhm before I turned 8 years I already start criming pal Tre h yes my life is way out of this word that you think you can make a movie out of it and it is comparing and it will sell anywhere in the world so I became a braid winner before when you see some of the small children haing in the street you said their parents abused them I used to be one of them but if that is what abuse is all about all of us should be abused but that was a training point for me because my my mother had convinced me that I'm a likable person and that I can go places and nobody can say no to me don't worry one of the things you require in life to succeed is confidence that actually there are three DS that you must not miss in your life MH desire is Number One MH decision to pursue your desire is number two determination to go through all the OD that will stop you yeah three DS mhm the liation of these three DS are three other things you need to do MH one is Vision second is Faith to Believe in Your Vision mhm third is courage to act in Your Vision courage is not an absence of fear It's ability to act in the face of danger and that means if I perish I perish but this is where I'm going I have sense of direction so because there are things that are going to come and challenge you anything you believe has to be subjected to test yeah for citizen mhm it is at that testing point that many people give up they think this test is to destroy you no this test is to make your root to get more deeper on the ground MH like the prophet told us when the breeze come is not to T of the tree that was when it checks the ground for it to get de rooted so all those Trials Come is not is to adversity is nothing in our life but a refining fire that burns out impurities in our life that's why job said when I am try I shall come forth like gold purify it so trials will come your way things will shake you up but these are school this life is school many times people tell me I am not educated but I told them I went through the School of Life yeah and I graduated with distinction yeah and if you don't believe I am educated you cannot call with my result yeah because they ask Henley Ford who is educated man the man that buil for mobile he said educated man or a woman is a person who organizes thought into productivity H if you can organize your thought organize your thoughts into productivity into productivity you educated but there are many intellectuals with PhD M but they cannot organize that thought to be productive but they can speak good grammar but they have no substance to substate that grammar but they speak impecable English but this impecable cannot put water on the cannot refine water and put it in a bottle what is of that English at the end of the day you find out that many core entrepreneurs and people who drop out of college I don't know whether there's anything assciated with it whether it is B whether it's so many other people they because school is trying to hinder them they ahead of school yeah that's right school is pulling them back they ahead of school after they make money they go back to school yeah because they they have something that makes them wake up every day that they want to accomplish and that that is the internal motivation God put in every human being yeah every one of us have a a a nature a depth of God in us yeah calling for it is called Deep that call after a deep that's right but are you willing to respond to that call and that willing to respond to the call is to show the hunger that this is who you want to show up the if that hunger is in you God is there to be able to uh bless that hunger and make it happen I worked for my uncle for 5 and a half years MH almost 6 years that's our system where I H from we EO people we call it apprenticeship M at what age was that I was about seven when I joined him mhm um because um uh um I should be a a about 8 I should be about 8 because uh that was why when he settled me I was 14 years plus so I should be either s and a half years when when when I join him and I work for him for 5 years 5 years plus usually in our custom mhm after the time of apprenticeship your uncle will give you some Capital but before give you Capital he has to pay for a shop for you it's part of the thing he said to you in fact that he will locate a place pay for one year rent or two years rent give you some merchandise and then give you some capital okay um this is what I expected that's a common practice among common practice but there's nothing contractual nothing is written anywhere okay and it is it didn't say it must be this amount it depends on the ability of your boss how wealthy he is on because both of you are supposed to work together to to build something for him to and I worked very hard while I was working for my uncle we started in Legos where his men shop start we made progress he open a branch in J I managed his branch in J from J he opened a branch in sokoto I managed the branch in Soo from Soo it brought me to Legos I was managing the third branch at okay at the age of 15 when I became a Christian okay um when I became a Christian before the age of 15 we have camp meeting where we go for fasting and prayer mhm the truth is that there's something wrong in the generation we have today compared to the my own generation mhm before I turned 15 I could stay without food for 3 days we go for camping meeting fasting and prayer it was in this camping meeting that we are on the second day and my boss came looking for me and understood I have lock up his shop and I was in church fasting people from my area business is religion we don't play with our business and my boss could not understand on a Monday morning working day I I was in church praying he was a Catholic and I used to be a Catholic for him this is this is fanaticism yeah so he he he sent for me they came to call me that he wanted to see me that evening and I should come with my senior brother and I went to see him he asked me where have I been I told him I went to church and we have a prayer meeting and we are fasting he said fasting he told me what do I repeat the word again I said we're fasting he said I'm starving you didn't have money to eat I said no we are fasting I'm praying for the business to grow so that we can make more progress yeah it's okay he counted 200 naira and gave me so I asked him what is it for he said that is my settlement so I can go back to church and fast it was like a punishment so I went with my senior brother so I said I said Uncle I don't understand if you have decided to settle me there is a custom you need to get me a store put merchandise do I buy one carton of plug we are not selling bread to put it in my head and H it and say buy plug oh I said this has never done so whatever I want to do I should do with it but he doesn't want me to come to a shop from tomorrow I should go face My Religion you know the word of God gives you confidence yeah I've learned Bal principle like I said I was 15 living like I was 15 it was my mother's Junior brother quite senior to me but I look him eyeball to eyeball because one of the things the word of God does to you if you live right is that he give you confidence yeah that's right yeah because you actually you become Fearless yeah obedience to law make you Fearless h I never stole his money I have nothing to fear I looked him straight into the eye I said Uncle I asked you again what do you want me to do with this 200 na I said I told you whatever you like to do with it you do I said Uncle are you listening to me 5 years from today you can make a note if you had who I am your head will be spinning you shook him there are something you don't expect 15 years boy to say when I said that he move on he said he said well I don't care I know you will be successful I said thank you that's what I wanted to hear I wanted to hear that blessing from him he said I know you be I said thank you my senior brother got angry he said leave that thing let us go I turn I said did you have anyone to give me when we get home he says no because I've also learned the principle in the word of God do not negr the beginning of a small thing yeah amen because that's also where many Christians make mistake weize things and say this it's not what that thing is it's what that thing can be in the hand of God that's right it's not who you are yeah it's what if that thing come to the hand two fishes and five rows of bread fed 5,000 when God's Dynamic power come into that thing so it's not what that thing is but what it can be in the hand of God of God yeah so I said if you don't have any why are you asking me to leave this one but I've told my Uncle to watch what happened when we went back so I team up with my senior brother we form a company called Mica Brothers M within 3 months we differ in ideology if if I next time you can read my book there's a book written on me my biography written by ambassad from the the what created the problem between me and my senior brother was that if I'm going to church I take one naira it's like $2 $188 for offering my brother told me you cannot be taking one naira in our business money for offering that in Catholic we give 10 C one1 of that I said P you drink beer I drank coke the offering I gave compensate for the beer you drink he say he's not ready for my Logic Let us part and we parted where God's word call for total separation from every unbelief amen from every unbelief from every unbelief that's how we part it's in the book and my he confirmed it this is true on this principle we parted well but you see if you follow principle you will never go wrong yeah prayer alone cannot make you Welling you need to learn the principle of giving yeah you also need to principle of praying you also need the principle of hard work exactly all of this need to come together mhm it's like it's like a car your engine alone cannot move your car but say mechanics without Dynamics is no good neither Dynamics without mechanics need to come together need to come together yeah he say if you take all the boat and not in the car you haven't gotten nothing but a junk MH the engine is there the body is there but if the n and screws are not there you'll have a junk because it can't move it cannot move so you need to bring all this component together then you get whole thing so this Keys all has to come together for things to do but we take one and run with it and left the others and then we keep on worrying that the other things are not happening every other thing has to come you cannot do prayer alone morning you pray oh till evening and play play and then he said somebody say I throw money you expect a lotac money I've been praying opening cupboard I haven't seen money I learn you walk for money God ask Moses what is that is in your hand is the thing that is in your hand that God can take and take and Jesus said what do they have said two fishes he said bring it yeah then the dynamic power come on it for you know atomic energy come on it for multiplication yeah so you can't come with nothing in future I will give you a testimony how God turn 2 billion NAA worth of an investment in one day to become 14 billion Nair in one day 24 hour one day in 24 hours but there's going to be something for him to turn around nothing I've seen it I've seen things happen but you got to do something you got to start somewhere so and so when you separated with your brother I separated from my brother and then how did you start up and then I somebody a friend of mine gave me um one quarter of his store something like between where you are staying in there and ask me to keep my merchandise for 6 months because I I didn't even have Capital to pay for a shop you know so and I kept the my goods here work hard you know struggle you know everything I know the first money I got I bought a hor speaker for my morning evangelism that was my first EV that was my my first investment yeah I've been on this road for a long time and I've been consistent by the grace of God yeah people look at me some of them laugh and say Jesus the millionaire because I keep on telling them I will be millionaire but they use it as a mocker to me but they call me the name anyhow but there's something about them as they calling me they are they they are multiplying they bringing progress on it and ultimately they live many of them live today to see all of the things I told them to become a reality it wasn't because I am more intelligent to than them it wasn't because I work harder than because many of them work harder than me yeah but God blesses that effort that we put yeah but you can't stay and say God will bless you without making any effort you got to go there give your best there and let me tell you many people I don't agree with definition many of us have for success success is not be another person in the game mhm success is doing what you are giving bir to do yeah so if I'm not doing exactly what God gave me back to do I can be doing better than brother a or brother B but I'm still not successful is when you are you are operating in your gift mhm that's when you can say you are successful exactly because he give Talent one 2 3 4 the prerogative of that number of talent is is depending on God yeah but one other thing I believe is that God only give you based on your ability to manage and that's another problem that many people when they see someone being successful in one area they want to do that exact thing and um many of them also feel like oh uh the other one is going ahead of me I need to do what they are doing so I can be successful like they are and they don't believe in the and what they can be able to accomplish sure we all can never do one thing you just got to find that because when we were small children we used to go to Mango three even with some ant on it biting us what attract Us in that mango tree it's not the it's not the trong it's not the leaf it's the fruit yeah when you supply your gift to people mhm then the reward they give you for that that gift you give them is success is money so you need to look for service Gap you need to look for opportunity success is like opportunity for service when you see where there are problem if you solve that problem money is the reward that comes to you so your your motive and driving forces can I find problem I can provide solution so you keep on thinking when you see problem don't run away from the problem because that problem is your opportunity yeah to become successful yeah but people say no no this thing is difficult no this thing is difficult if you are running away from difficult thing then how do you become successful it's difficult things that you you provide solution now bate used to work for IBM okay big gate got an idea of a of a software mhm and going to the management board and tell them I saw a laptop on every table they say in some table because IBM idea about computer is some big thing that is look like big door here they didn't believe in all of this and the fire bate you cannot fire a man with a gift because his gift goes with him yeah that's right and he go and develop software today all IBM things have biget product on it and brigate become bigger than IBM so you know if you have your gift nobody can fire you m because they didn't put the gift in you that's right n gift goes with you but you go to work for somebody to learn to develop and refine that your gift yeah but you create wealth when you operate in your gift when that gift become functional and being functional because of the product you supply app to people in Africa God said in his word in Genesis multiply the word seed was first mentioned in Genesis 1:1 if you follow the principle of first mentioning M the seed SE is not about making baby but there's African concept about seed of making baby mhm Bible say everything whose seed is in it will bring forth after his own kind MH that thing you have is somebody's seed somebody's brain sh this thing I have is somebody's seed somebody's brain child that's right this is somebody's seed yeah somebody's brain sh the thing is inside okay so for you to understand this the father of all of this is Apple yeah so each of them he born he give him the last name his father's name Apple then this one is Apple 7 this is his first name this one is Apple 12 there's Apple 15 as his borning children it's giving now the owner of this is Living in America but his children is around the whole world bringing money to him so we need to ask our where is our brain child yeah because God gave us a child in our brain to born when you provide that solution when you find problem you will solve to the world the reward that comes to you is money MH so and we see people creating things different apps different things when you Pro when you see when what you need to do any day you wake up is can I find a problem I can solve for people yeah a manager is not a somebody who identify this is problem this is problem no we didn't call you to come and show us problem because we know there's problem we call you to come and help us provide solution Sol that's where you become valuable to us yes when Joseph went to Egypt and provided solution for food crisis and wrote his own job manual and tell fellow look for somebody who will do this for you fellow said who is better person to do this job than yourself you go take the job and Joseph became a prime minister yeah but fellow knew that this knowledge did not come from University of Egypt yeah this culum University of Egypt don't have it what God does for you God don't give you cash he gives you knowledge he gives you information he gives you idea that idea create wealth this idea gives you money MH but you must show up by telling God I am hungry yes I I believe I was not born for nothing and let me tell you young people that are listening to me no human being that is Ungifted even with a person with impediment of sight there's a gift in him that he need to offer the word exactly once you find that gift you find your wealth yeah and uh maybe I'll just speak to the viewers for just a few moments uh that uh what we are listening I can say personally have uh been listening to a lot of speeches by Dr kosmas is a fountain of wisdom when it comes to uh you know principles Christian principles and being able to uh to make the money and and being able to serve God and become successful and the things you are hearing I know in the next few moments we'll ask you to say send in your questions maybe some I've already sent we'll check it out and uh since there are very many people so we will not take all the questions but uh we'll see how we go on time uh but there's this thing that I wanted to talk about uh that I wanted you to address uh today we have a mass Exodus of people from East Africa and many African countries as a whole you know people going for greener pastures to Arab Nations here in Uganda one of our biggest exports is the is the people going the girls especially going to Arab countries to work as housemid and things like that and others go to Europe and other countries so the reason is they say we can't make it here it's dry it's you know we are poor Africa is poor but yet you made all the money uh I mean the last I checked was uh uh you know you were one of the top most richest men in Africa and you made all your money here in Africa not in you know living in Europe but here part of the testimony that you said you said that some people wanted you to stay in in in Europe or was it in the USA but you couldn't stay there okay so the question is what would you advise these young people that's where mindset is important what did I say mindset the way you think MH nothing is as important as the way you think mhm I actually somehow believe that somebody never die until the person accept to die when you take the last bread I've seen people accident happen their legs are caught and the doctors have checked with every scientific means why the person will not leave and the person is alive and some people say it's a wish it's a state of mind you need you are never defeated until they give up so let me say clearly from Bible perspective that Migra migration did not start today M it's as origin as the Bible MH but what I tell people to do is to be sure you had from God that God is telling you before you migrate location okay because we have read in the Bible we've seen people who left full and came empty-handed back in the case of Nomi yeah we've seen the angel tell Joseph take this child and mother migrate to Egypt migration has always been there all the time from IM Memorial but if God asks you to go you will never have regret but if you go by yourself without hearing from God you may be selling yourself to slavery yeah at the end of the day and you come back empty I have opportunity myself to go to America the first time in my life about over 40 years ago 19180 M and everybody did everything to talk me to stay back in America mhm so when people are talking about Exodus it's not today people have been running away in the'80s was it not hard for you then to get the visa it was hard it was difficult in fact we're talking about which year 1960 70 19 19 1980 80 80 I think I went to 1979 was my first time 79 79 was my first time to us um it was difficult but like like I said I I've always been a man of Faith who believe because when I went to American Embassy the first ever overseas trip I made and the guy that interviewed me look at me I was a young man he said young man I'm afraid I'm not going to give you Visa I laughed I look at the man I said what is scaring you you give you give me Vis I go to America and come back to Nigeria I'm sure nobody have asked him that kind of question I left US Embassy with 5 years Visa first time I ever went to Embassy and I went to us and I meant to come back and I came back and he came back yeah people try to convince me to stay back that I'm not educated and I can get a scholarship I go to school those days America was much better yeah once you I came to I have um what do you call Social Security I just came back and I register and the Social Security then doesn't say valid for work or not valid for work so if you have social security you can have driving license you already integrated in the system because anywhere you going to work what they ask is your Social Security and you would have given a social security that have uh you could have given a driver's license I have social security nobody asks you are you an alien once you have it you are already in the system I have them but I decided to go back to Nigeria MH I am a proud African say that again I am a proud Nigerian yeah and I rent from William Bram message yes to be a true America you have to be identified yeah you share in her shame and her glory glory whatever she is is what you are yeah I'm so proud of my country that I want to prove to people that we are not just an idiots yes and that so dust is not in our brain yes there's nothing a white man had that make him Superior than me m we all have common sense yeah nothing like a spirit nothing nothing it's because I am born in Africa where there is hor son that make my skin dark that doesn't make me inferior to anybody yes I my mother help me to build this self-confidence M actually if you want to start war with me is when you think you are better than me then we draw a line before then I respect you we are colleagues but any day you begin to talk to me and talk me down like like I am a black man from Africa therefore my head is not correct then we draw a line I'll tell you you don't nobody gives you that Authority yeah that's right I never feel in in to any fellow human being no matter who you are yeah even even you are Donald Trump I'll talk because what is that I have the Holy Spirit who what did you have yeah I have confidence in my Christian faith exactly that I never look down I respect people but I so much believe on the power of God in my life so if you treat me fairly I respect you I believe all men are born equal equal so amen that's my belief so I deal with you I don't once you are come I don't look at your skin and my body begin to change no anything at all I'll tell you I will employ you and I have quite a number of them working for me he has a lot of white people working for him so it's not about rest yeah no okay so what that does is that um when the the um uh um when um we got to that situation um um um I went to America they did everything to me to stay back I remember in the airp Port one lady asking me what is my frustration I told him I visited here I didn't come here to stay I'm I'm going back to Nigeria they couldn't understand it and I went back to Nigeria let me tell you Africa is where opportunity for development is that's right the growth of the world is going to come from Africa you can still register a construction company today in in in Uganda and become one of the biggest construction company that it is because Africa is still a bush it's a place to organize yeah if you go to Japan if you go to America growth level is very poor the only thing is that they have a system that is balanced that if you succeed it can give you a repo but they are actually living for maintenance but they are not living for development maintain old building maintain this maintenance everything has already been built but here it's a forest it's a dark world we can create things so you can go into Agriculture and create a wealth that people will never believe you can go into mining there are people here don't see the opportunity why is Chinese all running to come to Africa why are they doing everything to come for Africa while us Aman people are running away and tell you this place is useless I tell young people in Nigeria the things you cost never bless you mhm don't say this place is useless mhm because you are taken to captivity by the words of your mouth useless thing canot become useful to you because you already condemn it you need to believe that if God kept me here there is reason why God kept me here and I'm going to make the difference in this place where I am where I am and because opportunity is here yeah you only need to see there are many people who can look but they cannot see but there are very few eyes that can that can see so if God can open your eyes and you see the opportunities here then you see the reason why they are all doing everything to come here because that's where the the opportunity for growth is okay so I saw that and I decided to come back I came back to Nigeria it's not like I was a rich man MH I didn't have $200,000 at this time so you can say I am comfortable I do not but I believe there's opportunity for me here to make it in Africa M and through to it all the people that advis me not to come back to Nigeria the only way they are better than me is that they have 24 uninterruptable power supply because I also have it that when take their own I put my generator so they have uninterruptable that's why I said not that they have more because I say I start the time they interrupt me I put my generator so I have power supply also but my own is interrupted the own is interrupt is interrupted yeah the second thing is because of that they are refug to have a bottle of milk and orange juice on it 24 hours which I may not be able to keep because sometime the light goes off so other than that there's no way they are better than myself yeah and I made it in Africa yeah changing a location does not change you that's a good point yeah you change a location but you have not changed yeah when Adam disobeyed God God came down and said Adam Adam where are thou is it that God do not see God cannot know where Adam is no God is asking Adam are you out of position yeah he's not asking him about location it's about disposition yeah are you out of order yeah I knew where I place you you mismanage your home yeah and Adam was replying God I saw you and I saw I was naked and was closing myself as if God didn't know you are naked when you he you saw already what happened but it's not about location is about disposition so many people change location but nothing has changed and that's why you see some of them living in her blood they still working in a f attendant because if you don't know the secret for Success changing a location does not change you does not change you so I think you would agree with me if if we say that uh this generation needs a mindset change mindset I started with you that it's a mindset it's a mindset shift yeah that this place is not that useless yeah and the opportunities is here to make it yeah but you need to dear life yeah you need to stop being afraid for nothing yeah and dear life yeah and that what it means is that that's why I encourage young people I said the time to make mistake is between 15 and 2528 yeah go if you need to break your leg break your leg if you break your leg it will heal again yeah don't go and break your leg when you are 60 years because it will be difficult to heal if you break your r at 18 or 17 3 months you are you are working again yeah there are years you are given in life that early stage of Life brother Braham said 86% of successful people made it between age of 15 and 28 yeah even statistic prove it including salvation yeah many people that stay through are people who are sa at 14 15 16 16 17 when you get to 30 40 you already being molded do they make it at 60 70 say yes they did but like in pyramid is very rare small the base is on the on the bottom so the time to really de life yeah to have conversation with yourself is that critical age of tender age you are more bended if you want to Som assault try to Som assault before 20 don't Le to some assault at 28 because you have spinal col iny yeah you will be on a wish year so speaking on on mindset change and of course you spoke about Christianity and how it changed your mind and you know to set you apart to be different from your peers uh then that brings another question is does being a Christian or and more so a message believer put one to an advantage of prosperity or success absolutely absolutely because you know when we talk about success of people have really don't get the correct concept of success frankly I do I am one person do not do not believe that money is Success what's your definition of success my definition of success is um my defition of success is um success is pursuing a what a while goal that's why I say life is about purposeful ding m reaching a goal or a destination does not make you successful yeah money does not mean you are successful because Bible say the prosperity of a fool will destroy him yeah as a matter of fact if you're a Christian yeah if you don't have a solid foundation yeah and have the baptism of the Holy Spirit money is the fastest way that can take you to hell yeah because you can Finance your sin and use your money to jam a lag in anybody mouth that ever question you yeah because Bible say money open it every door yeah so there are many people who are wealthy that I had no regard or respect for yeah I'm not picking on CH PRI CH PRI now is a king of England because he was born into a loyer family he doesn't need to work whatever he has was provided for him I would rather go to de lunch with a young boy that lost his father at the age of four and walk himself through college and be able to put food on the table because he has something to show for it you you can inherit wealth it doesn't make you successful what did you contribute to it to that so you need to work hard that shows your Ingenuity bring out that gift God if you're doing something your mother tell you to do and everything is provided for you that doesn't make you successful so success is pursuing a worthwhile goal that God gave to you it's not about destination you reach that's why beauty is not success power is not self success if you want to talk about it a of Nigeria has power your former president IND mean has power Alexander the Great has power yeah but then at 33 H okay so those things doesn't make you wealthy yeah so we want to you what actually how do we know how successful you are is we want to see how you impact nature life life is about impartation William Braham say my life will be worth living yeah when I can touch somebody in a positive way yeah life is not about duration it's about donation how long you live has no meaning if you go to look at your Bible we say said mem Liv 965 years and they died that's the only thing that we said about him Jesus died at 33 we can never stop talking about him Peter died most you because that's why where many of us make mistake you know God promise me 70 life is not duration it's about donation exactly most of the Apostles none of them live 70 yeah did you impact your generation how do we call you a leader is what happened after you left yeah if what you stood for all fell in your presence after you are there you are not you have not imparted anybody Jesus set up a company that we call Christianity at a tender age MH died 2,000 years ago his company is growing getting more client every day and I'm one of his client now people are subscribing to him people are subscribing to his IND every day yeah that's why grobal 500 compan studying the secret of this man servant leadership that 2,000 years ago after he died M he has over two billion client and this his and his compan is still growing every day yeah it become they want to build the company that will last like that they are now studing his son leadership quality that Mak him this successful MH because when you get people committed to your organization in that way then you stop working then everything will be able to do so so his quality of leadership was found in his exit because he built the foundation of it so success is not about making money your dollar in your bank account and all about that how many people do you impart what's sense of direction do you give people what problem did you solve for Humanity yeah that you can be remembered for how did you impact people in a very positive way I consider myself a successful person M and one of the my mindset of this is that life never gave me opportunity for anything yes I wasn't I didn't have any certificate of any form because I stopped in a third grade education but I believe in God's giving common sense and the I challenge status quote from the things that I was brought up from I went through school of life when I was doing apprenticeship for my uncle I could look around and I see some of these things that are being done can be done better many of us hear this word Innovation we think we must go to university to be Innovative Innovation is doing things in a different way finding a better way to do things to get a maximum result which is part of the things God said dominate this eight be in control of it yeah so I begin to say this thing my uncle is doing you know he can be done better so the problem I have with apprenticeship is that it micromanage you it doesn't give you opportunity to exhibit your Ingenuity so everybody must tell you this is what you need to do so when my uncle settled me my excitement was not on 200 na my excitement is that oh finally I can do with my life what I want to do I have the freedom I can now paint the picture on the board of my life where what I wanted and I started painting those picture so it excit me that I'm not under anybody's tutorage anymore but I have my total freedom Amen to Define my future and my destiny and from that day I begin to say this is where I'm going to be this is where is going to happen and so and and let let me finish this story you know I I told the story yesterday in church because when you are Dam even by purpose and vision you keep on knowing where you are to where you are supposed to be after I bought my car my mother was in the back of my car and my wife was in the FL in the seat and we are traveling when this thing come on me I speak like a DEA and dumb person I just spoke to myself because if you led by the spirit I said hey time is running out on me two more years I was 23 I had to be a millionaire but time is running out on me I mean I didn't speak him I spoke out oh yeah you did my mother said can we go this journey in peace I said Mom I never insulted you I just told you what I'm going to do he said please you know this your billion million million make me go to toy please stop talking like that because you don't have 50,000 you are talking about milliion when you drop me you continue with your million my I was pregnant with my vision and my mother wanted me to commit abortion ask women that are pregnant how they protect the baby in their womb I fought back I said mom two more years I will be he said if you said that again I get out of the car and I know my mother very strong woman I stopped the car Wind the glass down I get close to I said mom look at me two more years did you hear I said two I will be a millionaire you want to get down say yes of course I open the car she got down I bang the door start the car my wife said are you out of your mind that is your mother I said if you want I also drop you I drop away I left my mother on the road it was my vision it was not her vision yeah but she to see it happen because two years from that time I was a Miran and I bought her message is 198 she was a good driver so she chop out of the money so well the question was then does being a believer of the message P especially put you at an advantage absolutely because you now know principle yeah you now know principle you know I tell people forget about your logic logic is School way of reasoning your logic will take you from point A to B but it cannot take you beyond that after your point A to B your imagination start mhm imagination you can describe as Faith MH Ephesians 3:20 unto him who is able to do abundantly all that you can think or imagine when that things they T you in school end that imag that's that's why Napoleon said imagination will conquer the world MH Albert Essen said knowledge is limited to everything that is known but imagination can take you beyond what is known and that is fith did you get it it mhm that is faith faith yeah so takes you beyond what is known take you beyond that you know go and check the man called Tesla Tesla was one of the greatest gift God gave us in in technology and information development in our own age he said people are wondering how I knew all of these things that I did go and Google it he said many night I go by my bedside I take a book and I keep a paper inspiration no school will teach you that comes up I make note people see me every day get to the lab begin to do something he said sometime I keep the note in the morning I see something written there I take it to the lab it was the one of the greatest gift inspiration is like imagination it's beyond the four corner wall school what it will teach you and any body who is a Christian understand this because anybody else the thing the natural people call intuition is what we call inspiration insiration intuition is unau knowledge yes you get to a point where a situation arise you never read it from any book the holy spirit will said go left go right this is the way to do it you know this is not a man teaching you anything yeah like I said yesterday I said there was a time I was praying and I wanted to ask God God said why don't you ask me something that make me look like God in other words give me make a request of me that when I did it you know you have no hands in it yeah how could a young man withd great education build an institution that is known today as cies organization with my elementary 3 degree I serve in two public quoted Bank in Nigeria became the chairman of assets Bank the third biggest bank in Nigeria became the chairman of the credit committee for 12 years with third grade education every other person there have PhD M this that that what I brought to table is Street Smart the they bring KPMG to come and assess US every year I will ass we are 14 men Bo I will assess you you will assess me to avoid prudy I don't know what you says about me I don't know what you I said about you KPMG conncted I've never gone beyond the most thought contributor person in that bank I retired in 12 years with my elementary 3 degree H this only God can this Bank sent me to Harvard Business School I went to Harvard Business School with third grade education and I went there met up Nigerian business people there in school what are we studying case study the thing I'm doing every day how the business fell I said these people are studying what I'm doing I contributed better than all of them because it is the things I'm living every day they are doing yeah in 2014 I got invitation from undp United Nation industrial development program to come to vietna in uh to come to vietna in Austria in vietna where the headquarter is to speak on youth entrepreneurship 153 countries of the world was there I never applied but they saw my people are know advertis your gift will make a way for you yeah that's right they bought me business class ticket and pay give me extra code $350 every day and put me in a festar hotel I was treated like a diplomat Nigerian Ambassador received me at the airport and signed three people to me from Embassy to work with me go Google it or check it in YouTube you see me there standing putting things in my ear putting frag Japan was there America was there because inspiration CNN came to carry me in Nigeria for 2 weeks people are paying hundreds of million to be there I never spend the money this how I focus what I'm doing I'm pursuing purpose and by pursuing purpose I'm achieving much more because that gift will continue to make a way for itself so when I tell young people pursue purpose don't pursue money I never pursue money because by the principle of the word of God yeah I am a kingdom citizen of Heaven yeah the country where I came from is a wealthy country nobody's poor in my country there's no poor man in heaven the street of the country where I call from is B up with gold gold I tell people who are Christians if you're afraid of wealth you please considerer whether you want to go to heaven because you you get a you get a culture shop that's a good one I tell I said you get a shock when you get you get a culture sh because you haven't at a good house we are going a street that is M up of gold unless you never believed it if you believe it the country where we came from there's no poverty there so I never pursue money I pursue purpose and in pursuing purpose all of these things were made available to me me our King listen this is not democracy Christianity is not democracy Christianity is theocracy a king over his subject in democracy mhm people vote their president M the president chooses ministers his ministers gives him advice MH if he didn't do well his ministers impeach him mhm in the country where I came from yes there is only one king who choose his subject yes the subject didn't choose the king the king choose the subject yes St John chapter 15 16 ver 13 you have not choos me but I have choosen you past and end you that you should go and bring forth more fruit so the will of the king is our Command yes so if you want to live in this country you have no opinion what ever the king says oh King live forever you do the will of the king amen then the king take care of you take care of your health take care of your family provide you everything you need this is Kingdom citizenship it's not not democracy people confuse it with democracy amen Jesus is not a president he's a king that's right and that's why and he got problem because they think he's come to over because they think there's no they ask him are you a king he told Pate you have said it by yourself he's a he was a king yes he's not a president yes so and he said if you don't if you know this I will call regions of angels from my kingdom and they take care of all of this things so we must understand that we are Kingdom citizens and leave kingom way of of life that's why we cannot follow the natural people to pursue money to pursue wealth we should pursue purpose Amen to stay in the will of God for our life every other thing will add to it man I've never had such an answer to uh to that question I've been blessed by that myself now uh I'm going to I've never I've had a lot of your interviews sure uh but I've never had anybody ask you this question specifically maybe because you are not Believers of the message but I I think I want to put you on record sure um you were a Catholic Roman Catholic that's correct and then you became a Pentecostal that's right what spark you to believe this message of the hour okay good very beautiful question you know God makes no mistake I told a story uh yesterday when I was uh beginning uh two days ago I told people there was a king who has a servant and the servant will always tell the king God never make mistake yes the king say it's okay until the King has an accident and cut his finger mhm and the servant tell him don't worry God never make any mistake M the king get angry God never made a mistake you see my finger cut you ask me to praise God that he never made a mistake the lock is subject to the prison H because you think he has taken it overboard usually the king go and hunt with this servant and because this servant has been imprisoned the king went to haunt alone in the process of Haunting the King was captured by the r mhm and they decided to use him for sacrifice MH but their God demand that they think they would any human being they are going to use would be perfect MH and in process of examining the king they find out his finger was cut so he's not good for the sacrifice and they have to release the king and the King came back and had aink and went to call his servant and said this thing you are saying appear to be truth but one thing I do not understand is why did this God allow me to put you in prison mhm the king said the the servant said everything God does it does it beautiful God know he said can you explain he said oh King if you did not put me in prison both of us would have G and hunt and perhaps if they have captured us and examined you and find you and you are deficient for it they would have used me for the sacrifice so God allow you to put me in prison so that I do not go and hunt with you so God never make a mistake yeah okay I became successful frankly before 25 I made my I made 2 million dollars yeah and um um success is like wifire when ignite ignite here so I decided to build a manufacturing motorcycle L chain you know you have a lot of bike I used to manufactured the chain the driving chain of motorbike I have before that by 25 some of the boys working for me some you know Nigeria were are very clever people some people met them and uh the people working for me in the eastern part of Nigeria and they tell them that uh they can help them make the double money so the boy sold goods from my store collected money from Traders and gave to these criminals M and those criminal locked them them up and this become a big thing in the process I had a problem because they are working for me this time my company was not Incorporated mhm 65 threaders sued me under vicarious liability so I have to be hiring lawyers every day you know that's why I say when you have problem don't think that problem is kill you God is working there are things you cannot see you don't know where it is leading so I have about six or seven lawyers working for me in the process of this I hired one of the lawyer who is a Believer an end time message he's late now by I always see this man carry bible and carry another black book and I was wondering this black book is carrying what is it all about you have Bible why do you need this black book I was a Pentecostal the first thing that happened is that I observed this guy I knew he had the life that I didn't have MH are you following what I'm saying I'm following and he was different he was different and I keep on saying H I hope this guy is not mix up you know it's not like I I don't know how to describe him but I could see a gentle quietness in him in every angle by this time I was becoming successful MH and and I find out even in my Pentecostal life I was having a diminish return uhhuh the more I worked hard to live right the more I see myself struggling yeah like at a time I almost more concluding is this thing not an AB doll story only men will see the good only good men will see the angel I been I I started questioning my belief MH in Pentecost so I became a Christian at the tend that age I never fool around but I'm beginning to see myself lusting after women and things like that and uh this brother love me stay around with me so so many time we talk and he wanted to talk he said the prophet I tell him please forget about this Prophet Bible is there why are we talking about Prophet when there's Bible Bible said that there's a word of God is clear in the Bible so he keep on telling me that this is a message for the end time God sent for his children mhm no matter what I struggle the only way I can become a normal human being is to eat seven spiritual seven C meal and if I don't have it that spiritual seven C Cal that I'll be having some deficiency in my life it got to a point that any slim sliek lady pass is hard for my head to stay straight and I I will turn like this he told me brother you are suffering from Wom womes I he said brother youed you are suffering from womes womes I said what is that he said because your head cannot stay straight so when he around I W out I said my head is going to St before you know it I don't know when my head has turn again said you see I told you I told you but I see because the if if you come to his house you see the picture of brother Braham you see this is so I I said this book we Are carrying is six and seven books of Moses m so we became friends after this court case MH I return return him now as our compan lawyer okay because you know there are some Christians who said you cannot believe the end time message and become a Christian or become a lawyer so many theories but God does everything beautiful that's right so I had this lawyer and when I wanted to build this chain Factory I asked him to travel with me to go and do the agreement so he flew with me to Taiwan I think this would be 81 or 82 or 83 from thaan we went to Japan we were in Osaka Plaza okay I rented a suit and both of us was in the suit okay and in the night he fell asleep and I decided to spy this black Bo book he had I was afraid of it I used my left hand to open it it's called The Revelation seven seal the revelation of seven seal and I open it I never knew this book say anything about God then I read God in Simplicity I said HH this is talking about God I read the first P I moved to second I read it it sounds good I read the third one I started Ling about 8:3 in the night mhm I read this book nonstop till about 12:00 I wonder if the the media can put up that picture for the book of The Seven series when he get 12:00 I tap him I said I said is it the man that is saying this thing that we are calling a false prophet he said why not readon I read that book until 5 a.m. nonstop my goodness I got to a Point as I was reading I was like a a a a balloon somebody was pumping me pumping me pumping me and I was reading I was feeling like I'm going to explode I got to a point but said have you considered the word Justified mhm he said to be justified is like you never did it in the first instance he said when a Christian and then he said if you get a brid of a bucket and drum a ink in it that the the bridge of the that bridge has a power to disintegrate the ink that by no chemical form you can bring the ink back back when you Christian to confess his sin it drops into the brid blood of Jesus Christ and that s goes back to the original owner amen and you I I was like an angle in a in in a cage trying to flu my wing but the wind couldn't happen by 5:00 I cried oh God help me the people in the other room thought somebody injured me H I created a sin and I cried like a little baby my God there is something about hearing from the prophet yes there is what we call the voice of God yes God gave Prophet a different word how he penetrated to the soul yes I cried Revelation struck you some it was but this time I have my hair is afro I have goatee here when I came I came back to Nigeria shove my hair remove the everything went to my house has a house scaming house take all dating movie I have throw them my wife had travel my wife was completing our house at I was at 25 years when this happened they told my wife your husband is getting mental if you come to your husband something is wrong with him it's not normal again and I said I quit business I will not do business anymore because you cannot do business and be a Christian oh this brother told me no there's nothing like that keep on encouraging me I said no no no for six months or eight month I didn't I wanted to get it it was so Revolution because the thing about me is that if I want to do things I do it with all my heart yes so this is my turn around in fact my me my coming to the message shook Pentecost because I was moving with the top guys he might have had somebody like bensona yes I know I used to follow Benson B would take me to school to student you know tell me give this amount to this student you know God put put you you know put you here and bring oil Nigeria because of these are the short and I

borned and everybody say I'm going to come back tomorrow I'm going to come back I hadn't come back till today and I noticed they invite you to speak to them I noticed that they invite you to speak to them now I'm I'm their chain they have accepted me yes I they allow me call Brother Abraham on their pit yes I noticed that last December I spoke in uh I spoke to 100,000 young people noticed that I've been following redeem redeem church and uh my the reason why I respect you so much is because of the way you've been able to stand for the message I in these uh pulpits and it's quite something yeah I'm a Christian and I believe the message and I wanted them to know this is who I am this is what I believe and uh I don't compromise it in fact uh I used to have this badge Jesus is Lord uh it was in I I just we just set because this is also one of my life ambition I wanted to ear a company in Japan I bought a company in Japan so it's in Japan I lost that badge I'm trying to remake it you know Jesus is Lord yeah Jesus is Lord when I whether you are President whether you are Muslim I carry that bag anywhere I go I'm not embarrassed about my faith yeah praise the lord we need to give a a a clap for that for sure amen now this will be my last question and then I'll I'll I'll receive questions from the few who are here and those online so if you have your question uh please just uh post it onl online and on the YouTube and then we can be able to pick that up and we will not deal with very many because our time is fast running out uh but I have this one last one going back to business we we have a lot of opportunities here in Africa but working with I've worked with young people and I work with young people a lot here our church here is uh really youth oriented I might say I realize that the greatest hindrance is capital uh you know uh Banks borrowing rates here not only in Uganda I also believe in n and most of the African country uh countries are very high if at all the young people can uh qualify for one and I'm talking about business oriented uh young people so what to you would be the best way for young people to raise capital okay let me say you know I also work hard to Mentor young people and um try to talk to them uh we do have question and answers also that I take them in one of the occasion where I was talking to young people one of the young man said look we have been over mentored but we have been under capitalized I tell him to shut up because he may not like it but the truth is that the first skill for you if you an enterpreneur his ability to create Capital you a creator Capital doesn't fall from Heaven I said you get a job whether you are carrying smant or block let's see your skill in managing and saving money because you know I talk with a lot of people sometime somebody tell me you know if you give me 100 million by next year I will be this you I tell him forget about that if you want to know the truth based on my experience Capital please you equation of only 20 to 25% in your success in business mhm the knowledge you have in that business PR more than 50% MH there are other things that is required to all come to place MH but capital is not the most important thing and that's why people who do not know have capital and when they lose the capital in business terminology we say you have learned in a hard way and what are we saying your school fees is more expensive there are things you needed to have learned before you get Capital yeah but you refuse to learn it and that's why you lose the capital and the capital you lose now become your school fees because there are things you have learned from that time that you need to go back to the drawing board to do so your face skill as an entrepreneur is to understand Resource Management M God cre create a man to be a manager there are three characteristic of resources that resources is not in plenty Supply is depletable in nature and can easily be used up so your ability to save and conserve money MH is your first skill to show you are born entrepreneur or that you are really an enterpreneur you must manage and deploy resources in a very appropriate way mhm Jesus met those five people he gave different talent and questioned the last person who buried it and said you mismanage the money you could have the wor you could have done the wor would have been to put it in a financial investment where it will yield back something you went to bury it that means you did not manage that resources to yield something you must separate yourself from your business if you are a business person M and know that this business need to grow generate income for its continuity so your ability to manage will will determine what more that will come to you or you are going nowhere MH so I've told a lot of people that you need to learn financial management as number number one scale if you are going into business in fact even running a church or any organization you need to learn financial management if you do not understand it you will it will be very difficult for you to make progress that's true and if you want to know I learned these principles from the word of God Jesus told us he was a businessman M he knew how to manage and deploy resources m one time I think it's in either John chapter 6 or Matthew he had a campaign and they had so many clients after the day was over he started a seminar a business seminar told his disciples give them to eat his disciples are natural people I said what do you mean give them to eat this is a desert did you keep any buet here how do we give them to eat in this difficult place but Jesus speak Faith he belied in his anointing he said we can't leave these people to go like this these are our cry entertain them until one of the disciples came back and said look you know what you're asking us to do are things that are impossible God never believed there's anything impossible but if you want to know there's a young boy here that has his launch box M two fces of fish and R said go and get it they get it they blessed it showed it to the owner the dynamic power come into it Atomic power yeah he took a back seat because he wanted to train these disciples these are clued men 11 clued people two of them are professionals the rest know nothing and started refining them for transformation leadership m M many pastors don't know how to dedicate to grow their people you want to do everything because you're a pastor you can't let people to learn from you to grow Jesus gave them and said give them to eat he took a back seat he could have been doing it but he wanted to show them the power of God and the people are giving if you give this man a fish another fish grow up give another bread bread grow up and they fed 5,000 men and women 5,000 they didn't count women and children after they have fed with that number five five two two two pieces of fish and five roofs of bread Bible recorded and they were filled what is that meaning customer satisfaction these customers were satisfied I I love that yeah it's a business skill yeah it's a campaign then Jesus went into financial management he said pick the crops on the ground let nothing be wasted God of creation who took two fishes and five pieces of bread to fed 5,000 what is he looking for the crop that fell on the ground Christians are wful yeah we do not manage things well we do not manage resources you go to to buet you eat carry food that you cannot eat and mess up the plate and all of those things you have One Life to Live I am wondering that the sisters who entertain me in the last two days will be saying what kind of human being is this because after I eat the plate with it I eat you will not see anything on top of it my wife say it's poverty I said no I said I say it's no it's not poverty it's Bible skill let nothing be wasted yeah pick the crops on the ground why is God asking them he's teaching them Financial skill now after they pick those crops on the ground the customers were satisfied if you satisfy your customer you don't look for them the following day they will be looking for you the following day Jesus left the people jump inside boat jump inside this one looking for him everywhere he is they finally met him oh master master what a wonderful that who have we been looking for you Jesus say why are you looking for me why are you looking for me they said Master hey that yester that yesterday message was wonderful oh Jesus said what is the title they said my oh my my oh my oh it was wonderful why why are you looking for me I want to know the people were hesitating say let me tell you you are not looking for bread you are looking for you are not looking it's not the thing that I said that attracted you you are looking for hand out this ministry is not for a hand out it's for transformation leaders is to make you a leader to change people's life amen from today you don't eat bread and you don't drink mineral water you drink my blood you eat my flesh ah they said this man is too tough he want us to depend on him completely his demand is too high but Bible say his church cut down from 17 to 12 a leader is not motivated by crowd that's why Jesus said B said if there's one person that don't want to leave the church is the holy spirit any other person can leave any other can leave you the natural people will jump up oh there's Revival look at our church is growing because that's what why many people have church member yeah and few Christians that's right if Christianity is what it is Nigeria would have changed do you know how many million people that are Christians in Nigeria but there are church members they are not Christians because they don't stand for any principle yeah they none of them can stand for any principle because it's a popular it's a Prosperity Gospel is not based on Christian principle living MH people are giving and taking bribe what Pastor judge churches how much tith come that's how people are giving it those things are not Bible principle that's right so the church dropped 12 he look at the 12 and said wouldn't you go away H the Peter make that memorable statement Lord to whom shall we go we are not in an enting we we had some business I used to be a Fisher man we a fishing company me and my brother James but since we met you you've not just taught us how to catch fish we are now catching human being our business has even improved only you have the word of eternal life where shall we go there's nothing like this in the face of the Earth Jesus say have I not chose you 12 one of you is a devil all of them say is it me is it I but the says things I said on purpose he put them on their toes to live quality life and things he let her lost one which is Judas but he used the other 12 to create a transformation leadership some of them so committed to him that when they wanted to kill them he said I can't die the way you cruy my RO put me opposite down and they all see their testimony in their blood that is a quality leadership that came from him amen now what am I saying to run a business capital is important but not the most important thing you need skill I am a great believer in apprenticeship apprenticeship is one of the best university any young man can go what do I mean by that where you Ser under somebody to learn yeah every rudiment to run business is taught in apprenticeship we learn purchase we learn accountancy because your book must balance every day in informal way we learn Administration we we keep books everything they teach people in a formal way in we do research yeah in informal way that's the university I went MH so 200 naira was not a problem because I have the rudiment everything that require to run business so this skill when you put small capital on it you can see it grow many time people who if in my country I can tell you a young man that went to University and a young man that did the apprenticeship if you give an apprenticing boy 100,000 and give a university person 1 million give them 5 years the 100,000 will pass the other man and take a lead because he knew every rudiment how to run business so people need to study MH and I tell young people don't tell me if I give you 1 billion you you would change the word m show me what you do one business you have taken from point A to point B how you've been able to manage this and then what is holding you now to move to C is capital but I can see you took this thing from $1,000 and you made it to become $5,000 and what needed this to grow is capital the money will make itself available I tell you yeah you don't need to go to bank yeah you can borrow from bank but borrowing from bank I advise people who are starting business not to borrow more than 20% maximum 10% of their Capital because bank money have interest Saturday Sunday public or a day and they ask you to corize it with everything you have if you make me some people have had 20,000 which they could have managed and lived their life and and went to borrow 80,000 from bank this 80,000 Bank chop interest finished took their 20,000 they are left with nothing so it's better you have one thing that you have successfully managed and keep it so you can borrow from to expand your business when you are starting a business when you want to borrow borrow don't B to speculate yeah B to do already mastered business so it is a shortterm borrowing continue to do business and plow back Capital into your business so when I started my business anything I do not have in my office I do not have it in the home before I have air condition in the house I have it in the office because that's where I'm making the money I grow the business the need of it when I decided to expand my business and started hiring people I paid my staff higher salary than I paid myself because I the skill I'm looking for if I pay them what I'm paying myself I will not get them but I knew I need them therefore I take less salary because I am the owner and whatever that business grow become is my own business I have traveled with some of my stuff they enter into a a shop I'm buying shoe $300 I'm I'm thinking is the head correct I look for TR for $50 25 that will fit me because I need money to put Capital so I'm not competing with my staff because I own the business yeah so I knew the need to rain Capital into the business to be able to grow it because the business will continue to grow with more return Capital but if you fire the staff you take a certificate you look for another job so but some people their ego is what they serve so so they started competing with their staff and therefore making that if you have to do this I have to do this you are not a leader at that point you a leader you as a leader you know this guy is working for you you also providing him leadership so you are not competing with him but you are want that institution to grow yeah this is my mentality until you get the person where you begin to also train him to think like entrepreneur so to run business the first ability you have is to manage and deploy resources once you can do that well the limit will the sky will be your limit today my company borrow in every Nigerian Bank including standard chattered on a negative PL I didn't pick it on the street it's a live dream it's part of those things I'm telling you I asked God he said ask me for big thing no Bank ask me for Cora to learn money in Nigeria M Central Bank of Nigeria knew I lent money on a negative pled even including from them they borrow me on a negative pledge means I do not pledge to anybody and I cannot pledge to you it's a position of strength it doesn't come easy and because I have these resources available to me does not make me dance naked because if I if I mismanage it I will go back to where other people is but when you have unlimited resources in that way you can take on any business with a position of strength but it is a life dream that I have that I prayed for and somebody thought my head was not correct because when you are saying you don't want to see a business you want to do and you don't have money to do it it's like we are saying you want to be God because because Bible say answer it everything you have unlimited resources but I did I I pray for something some people cannot under you your imagination will break your head when you think about it but God give me Grace to have that kind of faith and he had helped me today we run business in Nigeria we run business in Ghana in Koda in um in uh in in Gabon we opened seron 3 years ago go I just registered Zimbabwe last year and then we bought a company in Japan so we are we we created Nigerian multinational brand just by 200 NAA the grace of God and hard working God has shown his might in the little things we are doing and that's why I'm confident to tell any young boy no mountain is too high no dream is too extreme you got to have faith in your God and be willing to dear life amen amen amen now the last question that will come from me uh here a lot of people when they get into business and then they prosper in bus in business uh they get this temptation to enter politics uh especially here in in Africa that happens quite often money is synonymous with politics I know yourself perhaps you've uh you might have been asked to join politics what kept you away and were you asked at any time well I'm a Christian um uh I would like to manage my family first of all um I'm not a politicians I it's it's actually difficult to be a politician because um what Drive politics is um popularity yeah and to be a politician and to be po to to be a a politicians and to create that popularity M you will not have character yeah and um for me um when you cannot keep your word when when you cannot when you compromise when you want to compromise you have to lose cap character yeah to compromise yeah so and my greatest asset is my character amen um so I cannot be a politician there nothing because politics is about compromise a little here a little here and the whole thing is diluted so a Christian I do not believe truly that anybody who is a true Christian can fit into politics you must make room for compromise to be a politician I think that says it all because principle is not what drives it thank you now I have uh someone called Joseph um I don't know where you are from if you ask sending a question please tell us where you are from uh the question is uh how should I leave this satday job should just leave and start with anything I will advise if you have a family don't jump out that's why we advise people to be able to find their feet before they get a wife because once you have a wife and have a children you have a responsibility and there are some speed you cannot run we have an adage in our vernacular that the hand that has a young chicken does not sleep on top of a tree yeah must come down so once you start making family you have responsibility to sustain and to support your family but when you are single you can take more risk if you need to sleep under a car you sleep under the car that's the time to struggle to be able to make it so that's why it's important you are not the first thing God Gave To A man was not a wife he gave him a job it's okay a work so you need to get a work before you take a wife but if you already have a a wife what I will advise you keep that job but don't totally depend on that job that's why if you understand this you will not have time to reply every text I have males here when they become 1,000 that's how I read them I delete it that's how I read it m in fact if you are not on my profile I will not mhm take your calls because it's a distraction but there are people whose job is make sure they WhatsApp and forward every message nobody has come to Guinness book of Le because you are the first person that forward or Whatsapp mail these things are distractions yeah um for a lot of people who do not know from the age of 25 till today I don't watch television I have no television in my house wow and what this has done to me and I be I'm a Christian and I be honest I travel I stay in a hotel for one month I don't know where the remote control is so I shut myself off from distraction MH because there are too many things competing for your attention there's too many things competing for your attention for you to be successful you have to have a single mind what do I mean by a single mind every one of us is a power station if you can if you brother said it go and check if you can channel the energy of your thought in One Direction the power of focus can break a bottle yeah H there electricity actually you are generating electricity that generating electricity in this room where we are there are voices that are going around here moving you don't see it I don't see it there's a power station but we are irradiating things from our thought process if I radiate doubt there are doubts that are going on I will attract them into my life if I radiate faith and positive thing I will track them into my life so signals are moving in here that's why said you are a receiving station and you are a transmission station MH but it depends on what you are transmitting depend on what you are going to receive so the first thing you need to do is your thought process how do you think because as a man think it in his heart so he is the first thing you need to work on is your thought process to make sure your thought is correct and bible teach us how to think whatever is pure whatever is honest whatever is of good report guide your thought process if you can get it right from your thought process every other thing will fit in that's right so the first thing this young man need to do is to said I want to own my own business desire that and determined to do it first of all therefore you need to find a way to support your wife to find a small resources if you want to go and take a risk when you come back go to your job in the morning then come back in your home to start practicing your work see what you are need to do and begin to do it by the side of the way as God continue to bless you over it there's got to be a place where you're going to take a Quon R and take a decision and move but don't be Reckless and leave everything and move if you are single I will tell you quit tomorrow M but if you already if you already have a family don't do that because you cannot uh jeze the life of those children well there you have it Joseph thank you brother cosmas now this uh this one is Alias Ina says uh God bless you Pastor and the guest is it possible or good to start different projects with small small capital or it's better you start one and specialize in it start one make success of that one then move into another one don't take three four five project that's this what what works for me the success you make in one will ignite to the second one and it's a reference point then you become a reference to success every other thing works well I had a young man here uh Daniel he told me before we started that he had the question I'd like to give you an opportunity if you can take a microphone quickly you you have another microphone we can give him this one if he doesn't have and this one yeah God bless you all God bless you yeah my question is what does Plan B come to be executed when run when when you're running out to your vision and how do you make it correspond with your faith in God I want to make sure that I get your questions to be able to answer it problem properly when does Plan B come into place yes that's your question yes when do when does Plan B kickoff in your life Journey yes okay um mean business yeah like in business like in business all your life the passion that you want or something that you want to get in life okay fine I can answer that question um you know when do you really think you are running out of vision because you you are never going to run out of vision if that vision is a true Vision will your vision be tested yes will your vision be subjected to try yes but a man or a woman with a vision you cannot talk him of it if it is a true Vision it may take time it may waste time but that Vision will obviously going to come to pass Plan B is important but Plan B many time show doubt in your plan a but there are situations where you need to have plan B but a many time the way people made it in life is that you close the bridge you break the bridge and that is to say I'm not coming back here once you know there's a link to take you back you can easily Retreat because you want to quickly run back to that nobody make success that did not Frank Chris speaking got to a position like I should throw in Towell people listen to my success story they just thought from the time my uncle said settle me I keep on making money life start coming Rosy no it's not true the person talking to you I've been bankrupt three times but when we talk success story nobody I don't bring that up we talk success story but all of those things that happen is a training ground I actually don't call it f fail failure failure I call it mistakes why I call it mistake is that it's a learning curve that's why I encourage people to determine in what they want to do and wait for it at that time you feel like throwing in toell there are many times you feel in throwing in toell I made success before 23 actually by 21 I was already successful but in between 21 and 22 I lost all my Capital I lost my Capital that I owe my landlord so if you are ow your landlord today the person speaking to you had owe landlord 6 months I couldn't pay for my shop my working Place 6 months I couldn't pay one year for where I was living actually one day I was in this I was in the shop my landlord jti IED him coming there's something we call show grass people thread there's a show glass the count there I hid under because the most embarrassing thing to go through is to meet an angry around Lord I he I didn't want to see the man say where is he where is he my boy I said no day he said okay come out come out let me lock the door I still stay where I am when I hear the door I said here he said please come out I thought he would change his mind I have gone through that embarrassment he locked me out and take the sh key of his shop he said if you get my money come to meet me but we don't tell this story that man was alive when I became a billionaire he did he just di few years ago that locked me out so I've gone through things but is it the time to give up things were so bad I've married have a wife to take care of and there were no food somebody came for my wedding he has given me a waying scale I believe in Dignity of Labor I never give up on myself I took the way scale to the market I Dro it on the ground I CR I said 68 kg line up yourself make you check your weight the people line up the first person want to CL I said wait where's your money 10 C everything is business I created business I started collecting money and people were cling taking the Mone and I took all the money I went back home my wife asked me what did you do I said I took this scale to the market and people were criming on it she cried like a little baby because because for her it was so humiliating is it too bad that this is what you have to do my are you follow what I'm saying yeah my wife does her certificate and went to get a job to support me financially God give you a wife if you are married to support you but he did not give you a wife for the wife to take the responsibility of your home that's why a good wife brother abam said after the baptism of the Holy Spirit the best thing God can give to a man is a good wife that woman is a help mate a help that is meant for you so a woman shows up in a man's life to help him but for him to help you you have to be doing something so when my wife saw that I was serious and I wanted to support her by the the thing I did she took up a job and was supporting me that's why the company I build you call C charies is a combination of my name and my wife name I am Cous my wife was name is Charity I didn't want to call it C charity so he look local so I call it CIS it look Greek some people thought it was a Greek company it's my name and my wife name that I combined so I never gave up on myself if I gave up on myself I would have stayed back in America like I told you when I get opportunity to travel to America but I believe I will succeed your belief to succeed must be greater than your fear to fail for you to succeed so once you keep on keeping that plan B as an exit way many time you want to run back there you want to run back there the correcting is burn the bridge I told you brother Abraham said I told God if I die eating this food I will come to heaven and I tell you I trusted you and and I die that means when you put Faith to work you are close to a mad person because only you can see the things you are doing is contrary to whatever everybody is saying but your inner man continued to speak back to you and said tomorrow will be better than today this is not the time to give up you become less rest you knock at every door until it open not he but not he that knock and went away but he that knock it you continue to knock consistently no success come easy if success come easy everybody will be successful whether spiritual and natural there are many people who are Christians even in their Christian Life they still struggling with one thing or the other it doesn't come easy but if you desire it if you are hungry for it there is a promise is blessed are they that thirst and hunger for they shall be filed that second part of it if you truly hunger that second part of it feel will come because it's also a promise and that is not completely depending in your hand so uh I don't know when point B comes in place each individual need to decide where his point B come from but many time I don't have point B I had one option that I'm going to succeed and I pursued it and God helped me and I became successful but I have I have situations frankly that made me like forget about this I've had situations that make me like do you want to continue to try this and God did the same thing to all his children Abraham Isaac didn't come at 9 9 years that he become a laughing M matter to Abraham Abraham laugh also sah laughed because like can we continue to tell this joke 100 years old but the angel said according to the time of Life by this time next year for everything under the AG there is a time and there is a purpose when that time come Paul say flesh and blood will not confir it will happen but you need to be there to to prove to Satan that you truly believe that this promise over you will be there and you will be making effort and acting like it's going to happen and if you are consistent you never doubt Jesus said if you say to this three be thou remove and shall not doubt in other words if you doubt he will not remove and shall not doubt what will make it remove is that you shall not doubt that's why prop said if you say to a mountain be removed and a grain of sand move that day tomorrow a cup of sand move if you are consistent and stay like that that mountain will come down any mountain in your life Financial Mountain whatever opposition that it is to come down but sometime we have more faith in the negative than in the in the positive and they still faith and because God honor Faith he works that way take for instance a lady goes to hospital and the doctor check him and say oh there's a um um there's a a RS in your breast without her saying the devil will say cancer she said cancer then the next thing the devil tell her dead then in her subconscious he registered dead whatever you are telling her she's a dead dead I'm going to die children dead dead dead she will die if you continue like that know there are people who have been diagonised wronging and they started believing it and that disease shows into their life this is scientific there are people who have dioniz rightly and they refuse they reject it and refuse it and that never become a reality so there are Faith works every time very consistent but that Faith must be held with no turning back and that's why it's like a risk but brother Abraham said I was I wanted to pray the man the man said no no we don't said the man said why do you rob me the only hope I have faith or hope is the only reason for existence when a life has no hope it will submit to Suicide hope is the reason of existence the hope we have is not a hopeless hope the hope we have as Believers are guaranteed hope am amen Romans chap 5:3 for we glory in Tribulation why do you glory glory means something that makes you have we glory in Tribulation tribulation means trial why because tribulation work it patience God is training you for patient wait on me patience experience experience hope hope make it not ashamed God is the Galant of your hope he's the under liigh this hope is not you are not hoping on on on emptiness if it is on God it's guarantee that it will bring something so the need to be stubborn with your faith I read a place to the church yesterday where brother said just one when he knew he had the word of God for it he became Reckless to be Reckless means to throw caution on the Wind you don't care anymore he said can the Church of God be Reckless with their faith that's a topic I taught on yesterday how to live in 2024 is to be Reckless with your faith if you find it in the word of God don't doubt it throw caution on the wing if God cannot keep his word can I keep it mhm you didn't hear me if God cannot keep his word can I keep it no no I have somebody's word for it Jehovah said this I read it and I believe it I put all my faith in it if I die trusting God that's the best place is to die that's the amen there was one Ronald uh I I think um you might have answered him in the in the answer you gave to him as well but I do not know I'll just read it and see if you have any addition to put um curious why do you think most inspiring young entrepreneurs give up on their entrepreneurship aspirations and settle for salary jobs what can keep them motivated the only thing that can keep them motivated is hunger in their heart if they give up on their dream fank speaking they never believed it at all it's like saying somebody is a Christian today and tomorrow he's not a Christian he had never had experience in his belief once you have experience in your belief nothing takes you out of it that's my belief you know you you the the you know you know when life make no sense is When Faith makes sense s faith is not something you see it's not because it happened it's something that and people keep on saying you know when Jesus said whatsoever means anything at all people there are new things people are discovering but so many people think faith has a limit where it stopped the woman with the issue of the blood she she introduced a Fai that were no record in the Bible before then there's nobody that has touched the Hem of a garment of a man and his blood issue stop any Christians can create his own faith today by taking risk to die to say on this I believe God amen amen sure uh I think we'll just uh we'll just come back pause and then come back after a while for a little break yeah uh a few more questions and then we'll call it to our close a you here if you have any question please lift up your hand so I see so okay all you guys that have questions please come and line up around there and then we'll just deal with you one by one and then because you took the time to come here I I I I wouldn't want to prioritize the online people while you are here um okay so we just take it right away I think the live people are we go okay yeah okay thank you so much Pastor for the okay so this is Brother Prince Zimbabwe right yes sir just when you come introduce yourself your names and then you just ask you a question okay I am brother Prince from Zimbabwe I am a brother prince prince okay from Zimbabwe I am a young Minister still growing up um I have a question pastor you know the ministry on its own is a very like time take in terms of time sure it takes a lot of your time just Ministry on its own and it has a lot of requirements then business as well on its own takes a lot of time and there's a lot of requirements that are attached to it then uh like you uh I've seen this video of you preaching in the streets which is where I started preaching in the streets you know it takes a lot of your energy and a lot of your time how do you get to manage you know these three paradigms of going in the streets and preaching at the same time managing the ministry at the same time managing your your your growing business because if as it is it's a very big business it needs you to be there hands on although you might have some people who take care of your day-to-day business but they will definitely come to you with you know very complex and uh situations how do you get to manage such a thing and how can it how can I manage it as as well as a young person who is still growing and once has a vision of someday you know in the nearest of the Futures uh by faith to get to exactly where you are okay let's be very sincere about it something has to suffer we always hear about finding a balance there's no perfect [Music] balance today where I am if I look back I wish I could have done better than I did especially with the attention I should have given to my children than the time I spend with too many things that were competing for my attention so um the same thing happened in brother Brown's life in in most of the ministers life sometime we devote so much time try to help and Mentor other people we mismanage our home finding a balance is usually very challenging uh something I'm not very proud to say but really embarrassing to me I really look for a child when I had my first son I was too busy with so many things that this boy don't see me until he grew up understanding everybody is calling me aa aa means boss so he what he called me is AA he doesn't call me Daddy I say it's embarrassing to me but I had to own up and why because I didn't stay home too often for him to see me and and play the part of a dad but because he only see me maybe once in a week or sometime two times in a month or three because I am here I am here I am other places it affected my friendship with them we are much better today but not young children so that's why I'm saying something must give up something must give way I I I I don't know if what I'm saying is making sense and I'm not saying my own was the best I I'm admitting in public because I'm speaking public that I made a mistake so there's no perfect human being no perfect life if I knew what I knew today I would have let some other 10 suffer more but give my family more attention than I did so that is a mistake I made the question you ask me is how did you find the balance um if I knew I would tell you you need to convince yourself based on your PRI priorities things are much better for me today because if you want to know the truth in the last 30 years of my life I don't sign check I never sign check in CoStar so if I can delegate check signing there's nothing I cannot delegate many self-made people like to sign all the checks to make sure nobody takes the money but I'm saying in the last 30 years I don't sign check in in my company there we have more than five signatories to account but two people must must sign okay so I've delegated that job and if I can delegate that I can delegate others that's why I can be here today I've never called office you know in the last one week but things are working and running in aut autop parot but it's not easy to get there because it takes a lot of energy it is part of those things I build I did that affected my family and some of the things that grew up this institution today that I I don't need to be there for it to run so I have more time today to go for evangelism but I never stopped evangelising from beginning because it was my beginning of my life so but a lot of people were actually were surprised are you not afraid Lagos of 22 million people that somebody could put a gun in your head in that street that is the least thing that c in my mind if God asked me to go to Afghanistan today to go and preach that's the best place I need to be in the face of the Earth amen when I am in the mission field in the course of work of God no fear pass passed through my mind nothing I do a whole lot of things to get people's attention sometime I'm going out on Saturday to go and preach I ride on my motorbike usually government officially attach two senior police officers with me I have about four police people that work with me or guide me when I'm traveling but when I'm going evangelism I'm not going with any police I go on my own actually where I was where they took my my video I didn't know who spotted me I was in a fish market I was in a fish market in in some ruler area and I come with my bike sometime because I I used to do acrobatic I have big bike then I use that bike to gather crowd people come to watch my crown I set up my equipment gospel has started and I preach to the people pray for them tell take some people who made their commitment to church and baptized them on the weekend and some of them have become you know Christians and still remain in faith so I still go for my evangelism so it's not a classroom walk actually any s of day that I am in Legos and I have no speaking engagement is my evangelism time so we have an evangelism group in our church we go to prison to preach we go to different places you know to to do that and then we We join one person will speak this weekend the other person we do we do that almost every Saturday because that's how to not only grow the church evangelism is like also systematic prospecting but Braham say if advertisement works in the natural it also will work in the spiritual and we are God's advertisement agents so but what we need to tell people is not to oversell the product is to let them test the product because a good product will sell itself tell him take this and put it and see whether it work so if the person can believe and put this into he will find out that it works because one is that I am the man Advertiser because I tell you it works for me and if this work for me I believe it will work for you so uh I would tell a young man to totally sell sold out to the word of God that's the advice I will give don't come to this thing with double mind let me give it a try if it doesn't work I go you've seen it work for many other people you will tell yourself I am the only person he going to work for if it doesn't work for another person I will be the next person it work for this stories we had about brother Braham is not a tell they are testimonies of it we found people who met Christ and God transformed their life if you are still doubting whether God can take a beggar and make him a king there's one standing before you so you can say if God can do this with cosmas he can do that with you there's nothing that make me extraordinary I only believe God and he see God saw he could trust me with money it's it's not so much of my hard work my hard work is important but if you can walk as many hard as you can walk unless God bless that effort it's intility whatever effort you are making so we must you do the hard work but your faith is in the god of Miracle who can take five rows of bread and fed 5,000 so for me that thing that happened in the Bible days is not a story anymore because I've seen God use the same Quantum power to change the things I'm doing on on a daily basis and see the thing grow like like at like instantly but many time it has been gradually so when a miracle happen you know this is something you cannot explain you know sometime I don't I I I I I hesitate to give some certain testimonies and the reason why he said to give it is will that become s exaltation how would the people look at it can they contend it because even Jesus said I have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now so you wait for the season and opportunity but I've seen God do things that only make me cry but all of those things is training like I told people brother BR used to go and hunt and people thought that that hunting was just for for casual movement God also trained him during hunting because he will hear a voice I said there's a squirrel you shut that squirrel at the right eye he will shut that squirrel at the right eye you know how tiny small squ is so when he's in the P pit the same voice spoke to him no matter how bad that disease is that to is he will he will say it because it's a training God used it things to train you before he will exhibit you so when you talk about that thing you talk from an informed position because you have experience Christianity is nothing if you don't have experience it's about experience with the reising Jesus Christ so you are not talking intellectually you are not telling people this person say this story this person said this story you talk like a child that tell their mother I want God with fresh you know you have experienced this nobody can talk me out of this thing because there are things I have seen and I knew no human being could have done that and it's not an effort of any human being a miracle are things that are incredible because there's no scientific proof how leg will grow there's no injection you give somebody for the leg to grow if you have seen a short leg grow instantly in your friend you can't the only way you can explain it is to say it's a miracle is that correct okay so if you can take a product that's like say what $10,000 and sell it in one day for $100,000 you will know it's a miracle it's not it's not that that product has higher value than it is but there is something that make that happen and you collect the cash it become real cash not fake money real money so you when you talk about Miracle you say you know it but you know we many of us talk about wealth transfer the wealth of the Gentiles to the hand of the Believers is a tell to a lot of people but people like me have witnessed it have witnessed well transfer because it's instantly it's not that one is not about working hard and money coming one day God just closed one door and move the thing here and the door close I witness it but as time progress I'll give those testimony in a very plain way where people can appreciate it thank you thank you brother gmas can I have another question ask ask we see we see what the time looks like all right can I have another person please if you could stand here welome what is your question I am is this microphone on okay okay my name is Andrew Baka and I Fellowship from this church I am an economics student okay economics teaches us principles of financial management yes tells us to to delay to pay vendors V again the last statement it teaches us to delay pay vendors that's correct or workers that's correct but the Bible teaches us to pay workers before the the sweat dries that's correct M another thing is that you talked about you paying yourself last and less that's right and paying less and paying well the workers that's correct I am impressed by that thank you and yesterday and the other day when I was in the meetings I took the principles of God that I'm going to follow them in my businesses thank you the one I'm going to start and those ones I'm transacting now yeah my question is how how will drive by balance these principles economic principles and godly principles because keeping money with me for some time before I pay it sure is also good sure God bless you thank you very much very valid question I like questions like this that means people are thinking like I said there's no middle way something has to give way something has to pay the price I have quarrel with my financial controller and I told him you have gone to school you we hire you to manage finances for us and I know they've taught you certain things in school but the principle that rule in my company is Bible principle you have to pay our vendors on agreed date if you want to negotiate you must negotiate up front not letter you can't and if you tell somebody you will pay him on the 30th of every month please pay him on the 25th or on the 28th if you pay on the 31st if you pay on the first or second I'll fire you I told him to commit in writing for me that we will not miss payment debt by one day because my understanding based on Bible is to exceed people's expectation and it work like a magic if you understand it the Bible Way is the only way the life to go people think the natural things that taught in the school is the way to go I follow Bible principle so a lot of people cannot understand our campign is a Nigerian company is not owned by Japanese it's not owned by America and the I don't know how many multinational organization borrow money on a negative pled I don't know how many people in my country that Standard chattered Bank can Lear money without corer I didn't pick it on the street it's a life it's a prayer point that I made and I walk towards it you know the Magic The Magic is that I will tell you listen you better take my word for it we are the best people you can do business with forget about agreement if we shake hands my shaking hands with you is greater than anything and I started applying that principle that even when I am sure I will be able to pay you on 30th of the month I would on the 15th of the month I will tell you the only time I can be able to pay you is on the 31st in agreement so that if I pay you by 17th you are happy if I pay you by 25 you are happy if I pay you by 28 you are happy because it's an improvement but nothing will make it exceed so when people want to do business with me I tell you I do business with all my business partner on open account because the best credit you will get is not bank loan the best credit you will get is what we call suppliers credit because it's without Interest Bank money has interest Saturday Sunday when I give you this water to sell without collecting money it's money that I give you but it's in a value are you following what I'm saying if this water is selling maybe $1 and I gave it to you I've given you $1 credit it's money that I gave you so if I give you 10 of it I've given you $10 if I give you 1,000 of it I've given you $1,000 and because I trust you so suppliers credit is the best credit you can get if Bank give me money to buy this 1,000 there's interest on it every day counting on a month and in a year but when a supplier give it to you he didn't tach value to it but he need to agree when to pay him nothing should make you not to pay on that day so when people now want to do business with me I I give them reference get a reference from this person get reference from this person one of the person wrote a Japanese to take a reference of our company the Japanese replied and said c charish money payment arrive like Japanese Express train called shin caner the shank shansen train means one minute to the time you will not find it but exactly to the time is there on dot you never miss one minute and people we have established this reputation so companies that are 200 years old give me credit people say Chinese doesn't give anybody credit anybody that do business with Chinese you pay 30% uh deposit for production when it finish you pay back balance I enjoy 120 days payment t with Chinese I don't make deposit they produce Goods cheap it and wait for 120 days to get their money but it cannot be5 days rather it can be 110 days or it can be 90 days but it will never exceed so we keep this record on a consistent basis and I have use this record to work with BMW they ship me cash on open account Ford Moto company ship me car on open account I used this to break all my suppliers before we start I tell you this is our conditions of payment and you can take reference so we have a pool of resources and people what is important is that we manage these resources to make sure every obligations are made on the due date no compromising and the person in charge I tell him if you fail to meet obligation on a due days you give me your resignation that's the system we run in cies and we have worked with this and the pays off so we bank if if we're working with you as a bank if you make us angry we write you one check and we will not work with you we pay you before we start checking whether you overcharge us interest we pay you Bank asked me why do you do that I said because different people will start quaring the bank become a goose to to delay their payment no I learned some of these principles this principle that I now from Japanese even before I rent it from the the Japanese make commitment with you before the fundamentalist start committing suicide if they come keep obligation they take their life a man I met his name is machita he has gone to dinner with me he wrote a note and tell the people he so sorry that he disappointed them and that he a failure put their life kill kill himself the Japanese have been committing suicide before fundament you know religious fundamentalist start killing themselves if they make a promise to you that's why religion is too strong difficult to penetrate in Japan because everything you are teaching in religion is like their normal standard life so they ask you what more are you the only thing that they drink their beer in the evening so what more are you teaching that they are not doing so they all this Christianity that is based on do this you become a Christian is being a way of living they teach people politeness they teach people hard work they teach people you know um courtesy you know you you don't go to toilet and mess it up you need to clean it after you did so that another person going there will see it in perfect condition they don't go to National s and eat things and throw away they pick it up anywhere they are it's a culture so the this culture make it difficult that many religion cannot because things religion teaches people what to do to make you qualify but those things you want to teach theman is already doing so they felt there's no need for your religion the point I'm trying to make is that Christians should live beyond what the natural law did many people didn't know the meaning of the word holy if you ask any Jewish laby the word holy means one people don't have a revelation but Abraham teaches that there's only one God why we call God holy is because he's authentic and is one the word holy means one I am God there's no other one beside me that's why you cannot tell any Jew about three persons in one God so the correct thing is that you must understand that 2:00 is 2:00 anywhere in the world there's no Nigerian 2:00 and and Uganda 2:00 it is 2:00 if you made a promise keep it and don't ever oversell your compan but overd deliver if you can and that's what the prophet taught us on the message let your life so shine 1961 September 3rd find it there let us not oversell Christ but let us be the advertisement board of him amen by the things we do yes amen uh another question please yes I want to thank you so much for coming my name is Ivan I have two main questions which I want to be so brief about my first question is about uh procrastination I'm sure everyone is a victim of procrastination that's correct people have procrastinated in the past others are procrastinating even today and there are few people who are going to procrastinate a few things they're supposed to do both in the things of God and in business sure and so uh I would want you to help us CU it looks like you have conquered that procrastination and you would also want to overcome it it's possible to overcome it psychologists have discovered that one of the greatest problem of human being like you are saying is procrastination um procrastination comes from Fear you keep on thinking I am not qualified is not yet the time I'll be taking a risk let me get everything right before I start and you never start is the coping mechanism that create that problem and that's why I said desire decision and determination this determination many time is like brother Braham said josua when he had the word of God for it he became less shake the word less to be less is to throw caution on the wind that means I don't care anymore whatever happened from this point point on if you continue to procrastinate you never amount to anything in life because there are good reason why you keep on saying I will do it tomorrow and by the time you are getting tomorrow you will do it next tomorrow and you never get it done and that is where you need to take a step of faith if I perish I perish you need to get to that point to said I think I we have been in this mountain too long look at it uh those rappers who got to that point to make that decision there were famine it was such a famine that was so horrible that people begin to eat their children you bring your children today we cook and eat tomorrow you bring I bring your own a head of an axe was selling for 3,600 sa just ahead of an ass till the people met the king the king said am I God because a woman they have eat his own child The Other Woman refused to bring his own child then he has to report to the king it was the terrible F but three lepers or four lepers made up their mind why do we stay here and die we have a judgment delay is a Justice delay if we stay here if we don't die today we die tomorrow so why do we stay here and die will go to the enemy's Camp it's only one dead that is going to fess us we don't have two Life to Live oh then theonomy 111 came to pass the Lord God of your father make you a thousand time than you are four lepers were walking each St they moving people were hearing 4,000 Horsemen coming there are Le but God multiplied their foot to 4,000 and the people ran left all the gold left all the food everything and the word of the Lord that again show you when a true Prophet gave a prophecy you hang your soul on it amen so I encourage Christians to stop procrastination it's not godly procrastination is expression of fear entertaining fear because people are going to laugh at me actually if you want to be successful you must be willing to be laughed at it's part of the it's part of the secret of being successful I think I'm going to allow two two more people any two more people no okay so you can bring your question and then lastly this question it's more of a it's more of a simple story that it changed the way I view very many things there was a father and a son who went for camping then when they raised their tent they slept so in the middle of the night the father woke up the son and said wake up so he told him to look up when he looked up the father asked him what do you see he said I sister stars then the father asked him what does that mean he started to explain astrology astronomy space and the father slapped him and I know many people could be wondering why why did the father slap him yet he was right sure so the father told him I slapped you because this if you're seeing the Stars that's true it means they have stolen our tent that it means what they have stolen the tent okay sure because when they slept down they raised their tent they were not seeing the Stars that's correct so when the father woke him up in the middle of the night and asked him what do you see he said saw the stars then when the father asked him what does it mean the father expected him to be as simple as they have stolen our tent because when we slept we were not seeing the Stars the tent had covered us that's correct and so it changed the way I view very many things because I try to relate it in like the things School have school has taught us and very many things we have gone through in this life that are too many and then we fail to use the basic knowledge the basic understanding sure now I believe like me there are many things that I studied in school that I believe are not so necessary absolutely if you have read if you read the book of Rich Dad Poor Dad the one of the the guy asked the the teacher theer this things you are teaching me will I use it the man said said so why are you teaching it to me he says in government uh collect columns there are many things they taught you in school that is absolutely unnecessary but they spend time and and somebody look at it and tell you you above average who dare him say you above you are below or above average so my main question was if someone has accumulated all this information that is not necessary mixed together with the information that is necessary how can you get to sa the important things then you leave the ones that are not important okay so that's the reason why we are here the reason why we are here is to focus on the things that are important and leave those things that are not important because there are too many things so many knowledge they gave us in school pump all of those things in our mind that are not really useful for us so the most important thing is important in life is to um know who your God is and live a life that is impactful for people people if you focus on those things you will help you to that's why ask me today who is the the best soccer player in the world I don't know how there are children you ask now they will tell you how much l earn tell you how much how how does those things contribute to my to my value when I was young my mother told me people who watch television never appear in television I should appear in television I should not watch television and I followed my mother instruction today people go to television to watch me but I don't watch the things that is in the television so please these are things that are value if you continue to watch television if you continue to read with all these things they not to catch your attention you need say don't go away another one is coming you spend all your time in it is it important how has there contributed to your life to take you from point A to point B and that's why I say something is going to give way a brother that's here just left what do they teach you in economics opportunity C what do you thread off what is most important for you what do you want to leave for the other things that means something to you is the thread off that is the price you pay for the real thing that you want I didn't go to University to learn economics but I learn home economics in that little way it helped me to guide my thought so that's why I tell you when somebody is talking to me he doesn't know the way my mind is working everything is saying I'm taking him to put him in those five things I wrote and see whether there's a way he can help me get there if I can't find him collaborating with any of those things is a distraction I cut him off did you see how my mind work so as a man think it in his own heart that's how he eat so I I grew up believing that I don't have competition people are afraid about competition but my philosophy is that the only person that can compete with me is a man who think exactly the way I'm thinking so if you can't think like me we are not competing for anything yeah well thank you thank you brother Ivan thank you uh Dr cosmas I uh I'll just say there's one person here uh called muang he said oh my God my life will never be the same again I believe God bless you mightly amen and I believe he represents all the others that have been following uh this program uh I think with those uh words we are going to bring the program to an end thank you but we do sincerely appreciate you for your time I know your time is very valuable and we also would like to appreciate Pastor Gideon uh for allowing us to have you today but before we dismiss uh the young people here and many many many online from many places would like you to pray uh to pray for these young people uh I know that they have uh many desires and many other questions which would we not were not able to get to uh but if we can close with that I I would sincerely appreciate I'll do that it will be my pleasure to do that but um before I pray let me still repeat one of the last thing I said to my audience today about the reason to taking things from point A to point B it cannot be overemphasized don't when you are starting from Grand zero just make effort to be able to create something that is tangible that a substance people can feel there is a wethy man who wanted to have his asset to his child and he told his son to go and walk and end $20,000 and bring it so that he would have learn that money is hard to make so that he can hand him over his asset to manage the boy went out you know the way women did his mother loved him and gave him $220,000 to go and give his father after two weeks the boy come back and told his dad he made $220,000 his dad was reading newspaper and there's a fire uh wall by their side the D said you made $20,000 I said where is it he gave him the $20,000 the father thrw it into the fire the boy didn't move didn't nothing happen he just scratched his head and went away and the dad said I've told you to go and make money if you make $20,000 you bring it to me you went out the mother said don't worry maybe because you brought it so quickly let's wait after 3 months after 3 months or four his father gave him another 20, mother give him another $20,000 his father Closs leg he said that I made the money said where is it he gave it to him the father it inside the fire I said I told you to go and make $20,000 when you bring it I give you my ass mys the boy went back the mother said well maybe we'll wait for one year he said mom leave that thing I'm just going to go and work now I'm just going to go and walk and the boy went toil and walk took him some time but he made $20,000 and they brought the $20,000 and gave his dad and said Dad I've made the money this is a $20,000 the dad did exactly the same thing he did took the $20,000 to5 the boy jump asset you can't destroy my asset you follow the money into the fire oh my God the Father say you made this one now you can earn it my god did you see about management all the others money that he didn't make he didn't Shake nothing happened to him when he threw into the fire this one when he made when they threw he jumped into the fire with the money I said you can't destroy my asset the father said you made this money nothing is given to you until you learn how to manage start small build small once you can have something substantial that is tangible you can show the door and opportunities are open amen but you need to make that sacrifice of early beginning to create something from nothing because God make you a Creator and you have power to create amen but if you like to get everything we Christians God give us so many things in credit but he still want us to end it you are not holy because you say You Are Holy but God credited Holiness to you but he wants you to earn it that's why I said walk out your salvation with fear and trembling but some people want to just say I am a righteous man I am a righteous man and you live in your fornication you live in all your this no you need to hold yourself accountable to become that thing you are confessing amen God trusted you and put it in credit before you and I ask you ear it m he didn't say when you end it I'll give it to you but he said I put it on credit for you but ear it yes so you need to that's why you need to break your human Spirit go all the way you know you can't just sit back and said God make me righteous and you live like the rest of the world like sinner no that means you have taken a higher responsibility you've started where you used to go you stop going there things you need to
