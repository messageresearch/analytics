========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] e [Music] EX [Music] [Music] and I am Pastor babzi your host now at the bench today we have a very interesting person uh Reverend Richard Steven ibal as a senior pastor at even inav Veil uh Ministries in ginger uh Pastor Stephen is one of our elders here in Uganda and for over 40 years he's been I think specifically about 44 years in Ministry and so he has too much experience and for us especially as the Young Generation to draw from and I thought that this would not only be a resource for the Youth uh but also a blessing to the more mature Believers to be able to draw from and so man of God we are so blessed to have you today at the bench thank you I'd like you to maybe take a moment and greet the viewers think you look over this camera uh God bless you all that are viewing now as you've already heard my name is stepen IAL and I am a minister at the inner Veil Tabernacle which falls under the inner Veil Ministries and um I trust the Lord will bless our interaction today amen so it's a a real a real honor to have you and I know even before we invited you we had uh several uh I I was thinking about inviting you in my in my mind uh but I had not yet done so but then some young people came to me they said who will be next are you inviting Pastor Steven to me I said that is a confirmation thank you so much so the Lord knew that this would happen today yeah and so would like to start it off uh with um a question on how how did you come to the knowledge of the message of the hour um well the way I came to the knowledge of the message of the hour is very interesting because the hours 1977 I came to know about the message because in the circles Pentecostal circles where I was there was a a very strong wind that was going around about what they called a cout uh that were thinking like they were going in the Rapture in 1977 on you know the month of July and the seventh day and the seventh Mee everything was 777 So eventually it didn't happen and it was very big talk in the Pentecostal circles where I was so that's when I first heard of the message actually in the negative and uh it was there 1978 now um just as I was going around doing my work as a witness uh for Christ in the town of tororo I came up you know across those people then for the first time I was confronted with the message directly that was in 1978 a year later so how old were you then I was 20 and already a minister yeah so then how did you become a Christian um I first came across the gospel as I knew it when I was really very young that was in 1971 because I was brought up in a Pentecostal background and in 1974 I committed my life to Christ as I knew then so that's how I became a Christian it was first uh you know January of 1974 and it was up on tank mua that's where I committed my life to Christ right here in Cala in kalala that was under which movement at the time I know there are many Pentecostal maybe Pentecostal movements at that time at that time you know uh incidentally it was a group of young men that had come out from the ministry of a man they used to call John yoa obiri and some of those people that projected out of there you can talk about a few like uh Caya I mean like there was his older brother called David makumbi and then we've got uh uh s inba and different ones but at that time uh I was associating with Peterson so and then a man who was called balinda under the redeemed gospel church okay yeah so then now in 1977 you leave campala and go to toroto yeah in 1977 I practically went to toroto just because I believed in winning souls okay yeah so that's what I basically went to do toor to kind of reach out for Christ so by this time you've been uh not only a Christian for some time but a minister for like maybe how many years uh that time I was projecting out into being a minister then that was the first year I was out ministering in 1978 yeah okay and well it is amazing that for about one or two years you you you know in in Ministry but you already had a burden and a desire to go take what the light as you you had it at that time to other areas that's right because um uh brother B when I get you back to my roots um you'll find that uh uh our family was deeply rooted uh in the Pentecostal movement and we've got a mega church right there where my father uh you know we we built a church right there so I I've been a big part of church you know most of my life yeah well that that is um interesting God doesn't just call anybody you know like you can see that he had the Levites and he was calling out of those to go and Serve the People yeah and so um now in 1977 the message so you go to tororo to take the light the word of God as you knew it then yeah and then something happened that you happened yes uh when I was in tororo and then I was moving from house to house um I found this little group of about 15 people and they were in Fellowship so I heard them sing I heard my Bible I walked in and uh I was invited and you know to seat quite at the front and they asked me who I was I told them who I was and there was an Old Gentleman they used to call him Pell Philly okay he was of a malawian citizenship who had settled here in Uganda and he had the background of his ministry with mson bzy so uh he was in Uganda because he believed he had received the message so he was preaching basically two major doct one was come out of her my people okay and two baptism in Jesus name and of course the godhead that was all and um so these people asked me uh that why don't you stand and share with us the word and that was my delight I picked my Bible and I remember I went into the text of Eli a priest with a deeming eye and so after I preached my out uh they they really appreciated me and uh as I sat down one of the younger men you know in his shorts uh asked me unto what were you baptized and you know what that young man happens to be brother Charles oio oh my God yeah you know uh and then as I started trying to present my myself uh you know my faith and you know trying to defend the Trinity and the baptism I was losing it but honestly at that moment I was sure that I was being confronted by these people that uh uh you know they were talking about quite a lot yeah you know that's very interesting especially you know many people ask me say how about these other people who are not in the message how will you know how will God judge them and I always say God has a way of bringing the light of the word to them yeah because you see you went you know with fire with the light that you had to minister to these people and they even let you preach to them that was very gracious of them and then right there you were asked a question you know unto what then were you baptized yeah so how did the day end that's where it started and so I found out that whatever scripture uh that represented the Trinity the way I understood was knocked down in that small meeting MH and uh you know I I was a little bit confused and I said are you the bramit so tell me about your knowledge of the branhamites so-called at that time among the Pentecostal cirs yeah it was just uh a people that were duped okay and uh to believe that they were going into the Rapture okay uh in July of 1977 okay and that's all you know it was they printed a tract at that time which was being distributed in the churches it was Yu Yu you know uh don't talk back Yu yuck don't talk back meaning that you know you shouldn't really answer those people when you come across them and U then they printed another tract they called it spiritual Pi Pockets so you know so you know I try to Resource you know whatever uh material I would re remember from that but uh these people were world best and so you know I asked them confronted them about 1977 then MH so they said 1977 we are not going to answer you directly but we have a book okay and this is the book go and read it you'll come across the 1977 and you know what it was the seventh Church edge book wow my I took the book maybe the brother can Flash that seventh Church ede book on the screen for the people yeah uh and I fed on it uh brother you know I I spent about two weeks reading that book and uh I was just wanting to get into where I can get the questions but you know it was so scripture based and uh by the time I finished the church Ed book I thought I thought there couldn't be anything better than this so then I went back uh to this people and uh they told me well we can give you some more so they gave me the seventh Church hede book and it helped me bring me into the understanding of the prophetic season where we are so uh it just kind of knocked me out and in October 1978 we had to Trail a creek because it was a hot season and most of the water water bodies were were were were were dry so we followed a water creek with brother Dio into the woods and we found a pond which was deep enough uh for me to fit in and I was baptized that year amen praise the name of the Lord and that was the beginning of a great journey because now we can be able to look back and say ah that was the beginning of a great journey then you did not perhaps know it would be a great journey no I didn't know at all and I always think that the ministry is submission to the leadership of God yes because this is the way God used even The Messengers they never knew who they were but they were men who had been subjected to the leadership of the Holy Spirit and every step they took was forain of God and I think uh this happens to be you know on you also and me we just do not know what would be we just discover we are getting involved with quite a lot in the kingdom and I think that's what actually defines the ministry is not knowing whom you think you are but is submitting to the leadership of the holy spirit that it takes you to the ordained fields that you were supposed to be part of in the Harvest amen so that's how interesting it was because at that time um this gentleman came independently into the country and uh he was sowing seed but then little did we know there was another group that was started out in tesso Courage you know and then different brothers were up there and then some of them that when the teaching profession came to throw GS and for the first time in 1980 we were able to meet yeah it was just like you know Saul after believing going into the Arabian Desert and then after some time he meets with the Brethren uh from uh uh I mean in Jerusalem so these were two different uh sources okay of the message coming into the country okay yeah oh so because we've had the other version of toroto girls um of um t t College and then this is another Channel through which the message also came into the country yeah it's completely another Channel okay yeah well that that's news for me as well I know that complete another Channel now I uh before we leave this part of of your testimony and I would want to specifically have you answer one question please the question that you had at the time because perhaps there might be someone listening H that has the same question or maybe they just stumble they may stumble on this video and maybe they have the same question are you Brites you ask them that question yeah and no doubt you receive the answer because there are people that have ascribed this message to Branham branhamism or people who are just simply following Branham um what would be your answer to such people and how would you help them understand what you understood um I think this is my view that uh there is a tenden of branding people yes and uh some of the people have accepted the brand yes you know you talk about the lutherans yes simply because they said yes to Luther's message yes and then we've got uh the whelans yes yes because they said yes to Wes's message MH and uh you know a lot of this goes on too uh you know with the outside world towards us M uh they want to do exactly the same branding to us yeah to us like they did to the Ruther and the different groups that they have done uh brother BS let me say this um I would not want to be called a bromite MH because that's not what I am that's not what I am yeah yeah I'm a Christian amen and uh that's what I am you normally the people who brand they are trying to be negative towards you yeah it's the same Spirit it SPS into the message of the hour and then we begin to Brand one another simply because maybe this group is uh uh so much interested in approaching the message from a different uh you know know uh springboard you know sometimes from the baptism of the Holy Spirit and sometime from the the seven Thunders or sometimes from this so we end up branding one another I think that's not the best thing to do in the message yeah because actually even uh Prophet or the one that we call Brother Bram yeah he actually said that he never brought a message to get a following or get people to his church or to follow him or believe in him yeah but he he was wanting people to have a personal relationship with Christ exactly because the purpose of this message was the revelation of Christ so if you get me branded uh you better brand me you know being a Christian amen because that's the main you know article of the message the main purpose and I always tell the people if we do not have the revelation of Christ now then the ministry of the Prophet failed exactly because that was the purpose why he came it was the purpose yeah to introduce Christ to us so you know uh and just like John the Baptist was he also said that I would rather decrease and increases so the greater object was brought to us and if you have to Brand me brand Me by Christ amen that would be the best amen so I be right to say that all the denominations TOs and their rations but only this message that really points people to Christ that's what should be and that's what it is yeah our focus is Christ amen yeah amen well thank you so much for that um uh for that inspiration I know it will help quite a lot of young people especially those who have been struggling to understand what is this message all about thank you yeah and and so then now this is 1978 and then you get baptized in toroto and then how do how do you then carry on how did you do you now enter into Ministry in the message now how do I enter the ministry in the message this is very interesting because uh uh right from there uh had studied enough to get a turnaround you you know a man who has gone through the major works of the Prophet you know uh especially when I'm trying because I have to give you this good springboard but when I'm getting my ministers trained the first thing I do I buy them a new Bible yeah and uh I would require them to read that Bible because if I give them I mean if they they read their own you cannot be sure it has been read from cover to cover but if I give you a new one sure you've read your Bible from cover to cover so the second book I give them is the seven Church book because that contains all the teaching yes of the message message basically that's the compressed work you know that actually introduces some to the message after that somebody needs to understand the prophetic season where he lives I give them the seven seal book yeah and after that I give them the book of Hebrews yes so that they can be able to understand the doctrine of redemption yeah you see that's where it's really compressed in the book of Hebrews and then afterwards I give them the two volumes questions and answers yeah yeah so then I come back so then after that and I had studied deeply uh the message uh I started preaching it in my former organization until 1980 when I was kicked out you know uh we used to have big meetings and uh the people loved my teaching MH uh uh the problem comes when I started using the name of brother Branham so uh they come up a committee of ministers yeah about 20 or so and uh they wanted me to answer a few questions MH so you know they would come up with this question before I'm in the middle of it another one is asking from what I'm saying and then eventually I couldn't even be able to talk to them I looked at them MH I said nothing so from 1980 I was kicked out and that's where my journey of purely preaching the message begins from yeah and that's the year when I met my wife and we married in May of 1980 on the 17th day yeah actually I was just about my next question I was about to ask you how did you um you know uh for you to tell us about how you found the love of your life uh Mama Sarah yeah ah you know uh Sarah was one of those uh young people who used to come uh to that group you know and uh she really loved my Ministry mhm and uh a few of them one of them is uh the present wife of brother chario okay because she's Elder to my wife okay and then another person was brother Beno actually when I came out he was my first candidate that I baptized okay brother Beno that was in 1980 okay and then uh uh you know I met my wife and uh we kind of proposed to one another she accepted we were very young people but I was looking at myself as a person that was going out into the ministry um with the kind of uh family I came from looked like I had disappointed them because I was supposed to continue with my education but as I read the seven Church ages I mean the Seven Seals I was like a Paul you know Paul lived every day believing he was going the following day exactly yeah he he would say those of us who are still alive and I honestly believed that and I said well I need company of my wife and because after all we are not going to have children MH because time is far spent then eventually the children came I said well they not go to school and then he finally they came to going I mean to the age of going to school I said well they will never finish they finished and now they are married women four of them and I've got seven grandchildren wow so you know it's a very interesting way but we live this life one day at a time yeah yeah that's what matters most amen I I believe many young young people like me uh who are listening to this cuz we have quite a number following on YouTube I'm I believe they would want to say when I grow up I want to be like you Pastor yeah sometimes people say so and they say I would like to be like you simply because they are seeing me now yes but they're not ready to do the sacrifice that you but if they saw me then they would respect Sister Sarah so much yes you know because she got married to nothing exactly you know nothing she just married the love of Christ that's so and um I really appreciate and appreciate her so much and I think you have a way of answering my questions before I ask you because my next question was why is why in your opinion is it increasingly difficult for young people now to start or and to keep the to keep marriage their marriages um there are quite a number of things things that affect marriages today uh first of all the reason why they marry mhm that's very very important uh you are a pastor and uh how many weddings have you had in church here so far well our church has been three years so we had one wedding one wedding and we having others this year yeah I want you to notice the next wedding that comes it may and must be bigger than the one you just had sure you know there is a way of competition yes among the young people yes you know if one marries a girl with this beauty you know prescription another would really like to find one that would equally compete or surpass yeah so you find that the reason why the young people are marrying today yeah is not you know for them to really be the beginning of the church because families is a cell of the major Church M uh God identifies himself with families when he created Adam and Eve he created them on a family specific a mhm and even in times when there is chaos and stuff you know God always desires to work together with families you know Rahab you know she was able to pick the token for the family uh you remember the man who was in prison and uh you know God came down and the light when I mean Paul and Silas were in prison you know the light came down down and the chains fell and the Jailer wanted to kill himself says no don't you know he says we are all here so he desired to have the god of these men and the answer was you shall be saved and your house so God literally uh you know created this nature based on family specification if I can say like that I'll give you an example here that um uh in Ephesians 5 you know when the family is broken down you know it is uh taken on a parallel of Christ and the church so if a man or a woman wants to marry he must be willing to be taking that symbol back home with him of Christ and the church now if both of them uh do their best to replicate what exactly their role is the sister will say well I'm going to study so much and understand what the bride is and then she does her best to bring forth the character of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and the man does his best to bring forth you know the character of Christ then we've got smaller sales of of the church Church from the bigger church but this is not what people are marrying for one they are marrying because they have come to age M two they are marrying because they become too busy yeah they cannot do their clothes anymore so they need a helper they need a cook and they feel like they need to procreate they need some children so you find that entirely the young people today they reason why they marry is fa based on the word and remember God will only defend his word so if he doesn't see the purpose in what you're doing I don't know whether you can really be blessed in it too uh is the social media yeah yeah everything that comes up people have learned to Google they Google about marriages they don't consult pastors anymore so they want to solve their own problems and uh they don't use the ministry to keep them guided in different ways it's completely very difficult so that's the reason why the marriages fail today there's a lot of impatience and uh two also the spirit of the time yeah that's right yeah people are too busy yeah people are looking for money they like lives are always stressed so it has a very big strain on a family relationship yeah well uh maybe for just a moment to you our viewers if you can just please share the link of this YouTube uh uh broadcast let because you see what we're hearing is a lot of wisdom some of the things I'm hearing I myself I'm being impacted by them and I believe that if you can share this it will be don't get don't be selfish you see if you you're blessed by this this wisdom from the man of God please share the link and let others as well come and hear what you're hearing uh I'd like to take you back a little bit uh on the subject of the message yeah um you spoke about you know the very first things first you say that the first thing that you would do or you would do for a person who has come into the message is to give them the Bible no the people who want to get into the Ministry oh oh those who want to get into the ministry all right say say give them the Bible and then next the seven give them the seven Church age book and and and then the other messages like the Hebrews and others yeah so here comes a question and this is a bumb show because it is been overly debated in the message yeah because you you have a lot of people now that say some say well the message and the Bible is different and others said no the message is the Bible and the Bible is the message you have a lot of wisdom and not of your own but because of course you have a calling of God upon your life and a lot of years of experience and no doubt God has blessed your ministry and uh we've seen quite thousands um have come into the message in this country over the years in your ministry what have you taught well brother BS those things come when people have a problem yeah before a man devs a problem he cannot separate Bible and the message to begin with the Bible became a new Bible at the opening of The Seven Seals yeah that the mystery that had being you know hidden from before the foundation of the world was broken with the opening of The Seven Seals now when we talk about the opening of The Seven Seals it's not literally the preaching of the seven seal message MH but the revelation of what exactly Christ was BR the prophet exactly and the pur of the Prophet was to restore the people back to the word now if you find a problem of getting to study the message and you lock yourself to the Bible the Revelation didn't come to you then there's no reason why we needed a prophet you see what I mean exactly so I think any man who really believes this message and believes Revelation 10:7 believes Malachi 4 you know he really hold the ministry of the Prophet highly because that was the only Channel by which we could get back to the Bible yeah so we had Bible throughout you know but nobody ever got this which we have yeah you know but this is exactly what happens brother B that in Egypt they were slaves M they were under whips MH and they were under labor and God says I've heard your cry I've seen your afflictions and then he came down by the ministry of a manh that's the only way they could be delivered you know they went into ex I mean into captivity by rejecting the ministry of an anointed man Joseph if they had accepted Joseph it would be Canan that would be the food basket because that's where the wisdom would be but they rejected him and sent him over MH and out there God used him to understand exactly what was going to happen and then even the the family came to Egypt finally MH you know and then they got caught there the the only way they could be delivered was to reverse you see uh was to reverse their kind of stess against the ministry so God sends them Moses and he says Moses go and Moses goes to bring them out but you know when they came out of captivity and that's noral then we we have got different men who come and says we are also a holy man you know and so because they away from captivity they think now it is easier here they want rise up you know and let me tell you it is such a very very very very uh I don't know which words to use it was quite important that the children of Israel obey Moses exactly you see what I mean when they came out of Egypt they come into the Wilderness when they were in the wilderness you know they would do all kinds of things you know and then Moses would stand there in between and God would save them they would do another thing Moses would stand in there God would save them but when they try to reject Moses again Moses couldn't redeem them from that exactly because they were repeating exactly what they did against Joseph and so God says separate yourselves from these men that's when Moses's uh standing in the Gap wouldn't work wouldn't work yeah and then the ground swallowed them so I don't really think it is wisdom uh after you've studied the message and you seem to understand the Bible that you refuse other people to study the message and then you become The Interpreter I think that's not wise yeah the world purpose is let me take the position of the Prophet now and I think this is basically what Pentecostalism has done because many ministers study the message they have a lot of messages packed in their homes on their iPads and tablets they study the me they really study the message but they pick out what they want to preach and then they add their own Revelations upon it and then they bring a a very you know you know good Revelation to the people and the people are like oh he's a man of God he has powerful Revelation yeah but I think the difference between us and the Pentecostal world is we take the message and give it to the people yeah and you cannot separate the man from the message from his message yeah and that's true brother B because in the 70s and the early '90s we had a public library in ginger and uh most of the people that were coming to borrow these books were ministers from other denominations amazing yeah they did they took a lot so you know I think we should be humble enough to accept this ministry which God sent our way mhm amen amen well I see that you cannot be able to take man out of out of the gospel because God has always used man I see even when in the New Testament even when God even when the house of um of Cornelius I believe it was uh praying and crying for God to visit them and to give them Revelation and he sends them a man yeah he could have sent an angel from heaven but he sent he sent them a man he did but the angel didn't have the formula the angel says go down to Peter is in Joba he has the formula yeah so can we say then that this message is the the Bible I've often said this and you can correct me if I'm wrong that the Bible is the absolute but the message is the absolute revelation of the Bible exactly yeah the Bible is the absolute and the absolute does not mean that it takes away the standard of God yeah because the standard of God you know brother branam says he would have used the wind he would have used the Sun but he chose to use man that's the standard so much as this is absolute it doesn't take away the human Ministry you see what I mean otherwise the people would stay there and just study the Bible and don't come to church yeah you know that you know uh uh because when God deals with us God is dealing with the body you see what I mean yeah I don't believe in a man being saved and hases not become part of the body because every joint must Supply you know you must stand in somewhere and be able to minister as because generally we need to go back to uh to real uh fundamentals um we need to know what a son of God is MHM that's very important because when the Son of God was created he was given a body to live in mhm so the Son of God is that seed Gene that God put in your body you know and that seed Gene comes from a multitude of other genes that are connected to the par gen which is God himself so when God creates men there is a way that he keeps bringing them together and making them function together as a body you see anybody who really says I've got the revelation of the word and is totally separating me away from the rest of the part of the body I think there is a very big problem with that person exactly because church is about the body MH you know so you cannot say now I know what I'm supposed to uh to to believe so I can separate myself and study the Bible MH and uh now I don't need the types and or you can even say now I know what I'm supposed to believe I've got the types I cannot come to church you are completely destroying the concept that the prophet himself built amen you know and with all this kind of thing like we've struck a junction this is the final Junction brother there's not any other Junction there's no greater than Malachi 4 because all the the the Mysteries are revealed you know we are not building more Mysteries so that we can also turn out to be revealers exactly you see so we are dealing with the revealed message there is no other Junction this is the final one it's a finished work yeah yeah so uh speaking about separating from the rest of the body uh then there's something that uh uh you know just came to my mind as you saying that uh you find that uh brother bam said that when they denominate they die um would I be right to say that there is also some kind of level of a denomination Spirit creeping into the message whereby whereby some some person will you know maybe say I have a revel we have a revelation of this and we're the only right ones and that even to the extent that some people may even be afraid to go to go join others in a convention to go you know fellowship with others and they don't even respect other ministers it's only their ministers their pastors their church because they have it all they have the Revelation that's a very big problem brother B um when Believers begin to think like that we have been given uh you know uh what I would call living examples um we can go back to the seven churches that were in Asia Minor these churches they were seven and a small parcel of land brother the Branham says 7 7 square mile piece of land and uh when we come to interact with what those churches were you find that they were all basically answerable to one living Apostle yeah and that's John the Apostle but when you look at the their exploits their victories were not uniform and their weaknesses were not uniform yeah but yet they were under one Ministry I want to say that when you unify churches by trying to build uh a consensus in Doctrine and delivery you destroy the people people mhm because the challenges are not the same from local church to another exactly so when the message was sent over to one local church it was unto the Church of Ephesus so Ephesus received the message but at the end you know he that has an let him hear what the spirit says to the churches so the victor of eus became a teaching example to the rest of the churches you understand what I mean yeah so Ephesus would become a teaching example I think this is also what we should be we are not talking about uniformity in character in the church we are saying that God uses the church here inongo in a different way he uses us down in ginger in totally different way but then whatsoever we have is very very applicable and necessary for the church in namugongo amen yeah exactly the same way what the church in namugongo has is literally important for us because they come as testimony of their Victory this group comes as testimony of their Victory and that group comes and you see as long long as it is the holy spirit there will not be any form of friction amen amen yeah that's right it will not be any form of friction wherever there is friction then you know the car of man has a play in it yeah we are called to be a body and uh you know we are not called just like I always say brother bass I want you to note this that God is a wealthy godh in design so for example talk about the fruits how many thousands of edible fruits do we have in the world they taste different they've got a different shape they've got a different uh uh you know lifespan different one from another he's a god of multiple varieties when you get all different bananas for example they are totally different taste different this so God even in making men he makes black he makes white he makes yellow you know but even in the black Among Us he makes different designs like like in the church here you are the only you and in the world you are the only one who has got this thumb print billions will be tested and nobody will come forth with your thumb print so so there is no need then for competition that somebody's going to take my place yeah that's where I'm going there is nothing like competition in the body you are just fitting in where God has blessed you you know God will and has never duplicated anybody until all those seed gen that were in him are complete then he can take us all together as a body see what I mean amen yeah so we really need to kind of rest that when God calls you to work a certain way do what God has called you to do and don't waste your time criticizing another brother because God has called him to do the way he does it that's right you see and that's the problem that we have today that a man has hundreds of people sitting in front of him but he has got enough time to criticize some other people which are about 1,000 miles away from him so uh I think we need to grow out of that amen and I think I'll just say while a pastor takes a siep of water just speak to you young ministers especially that are following um this uh interview today there there is no reason to criticize others there is no reason to feel like somebody else is taking your place we've had a pastor tell us you see if God called you just follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit do what the Holy Spirit tells you to do and if we all did that then I'm telling you that we would do a lot of damage to the kingdom of darkness but I think the problem that we have especially with the young generation is We are Becoming copycats everybody wants to do what somebody else is doing and when somebody does something they feel like oh they they're going going ahead of me I need to rush after them I need to catch up with them there is no catching up with anybody you know be who God has called you to to be can I say something also and if I ever try to make every Minister like myself then I'm killing the varet of the calling of God Amen that's right yeah and I tell my ministers back home that they do not need to be like me mhm because they are not me they've got a different calling when brother James katumba stands to minister totally different from me m so it's very important that the young men don't put themselves on pressure to be like somebody else and Pastor you travel a lot you travel a lot say that you've traveled to the US or you've going to Germany or whichever country and then Pastor katumba you know he at home and is local pastor and pastoring the people are you not afraid that when you come back he's taking the ministry and you know and you know people are now looking up to him and no longer to you no sir no sir um I don't see things like that MH um I think a man who gets at the center MH of an opportunity mhm and destroy is the work that he has been honored to share in MH has a problem amen yeah and uh I'm here to tell you m every Church which breaks off unceremoniously they never settle MH they never settle mhm yeah I think it's very important uh for ministers to really be able to understand that when God calls you you are not a threat to me exactly you are called of God to serve God God didn't call you to fight me mhm that's not the call God called you to serve his children amen so the objective and motive of every Ministry must be checked amen yeah so I'm not threatened because uh brother James katumba is real tested character real tested character and uh the Lord has so much greatly used him amen yeah and uh I think if we could get men like that we would not uh be overburdened by the work which God has given to us mhm you know perfect love casts out fear yeah that's right you know it casts out fear so sometimes the ministers are breaking their backs simply because they are lacking in the area of perfect love Yeah and uh sometimes we fear too much until we cause the people that work with us a problem yeah you know why are you not settled you asked me to work with you but you unsettled you know this is adoption now yeah uh when we talk about adoption we are talking about somebody who has grown to the r of his father because many times when we teach adoption uh people are giving examples about a natural father but a natural father dies so the spiritual adoption is you coming into position of responsibility with the heavenly father that never dies yeah so you must be able you know when you are coming to your adoption you must be able to come to a level where you are going to be permanently trusted that's right yeah I'll give you an example of The Prodigal Son The Prodigal Son did not know that adoption means permanently being under the leadership of the headship MH he helped his father raise the farm to such a great height and then he said I think if I took my own it would be greater yeah so he says give me what belongs to me he was given he went but the moment he walked away from the headship then that Prosperity anointing left him left him completely because adoption is permanently staying under the leadership of the headship yeah and uh even the younger men that are going to become ministers today you take that same picture that when you really have been trusted by a a headship and given a responsibility in church wait until the Lord moves you from that spot to another spot yeah yeah it should not be you know you trying to say give me what belongs to me you know you go and you squander it and then you're like no longer even respect you you're no longer my you know my pastor I'm a pastor of my own and you know they they like quoting you know what a prophet say that every church is Sovereign so maybe you can throw more light on that so if a church is Sovereign and I came out from under your ministry does it mean that I no longer look up to you I no longer respect you I just do things my way I don't even listen to your councel yeah when we said the church uh every local church is uh you know Sovereign we are not saying that you are pulled away even from your spiritual ancestry you know the church where you came from certainly you have a pastor when you go yeah the reason why we get problems with some of these young ministers is that they have been in church but they've not been pastored yeah yeah they are part of church for 10 years but they have never been pastored why they were there they were interested in hearing what you preach because they wanted to preach yeah but they never subjected themselves to being pastored yeah so they woke out with exactly a rebellious Spirit saying that now I am independent yeah but the independence of a local church is actually in the area of administration mhm yeah not completely saying that now I'm not answerable to the rest of the body of Christ no but responsible for their own you know incomes and plans and uh developments and maybe bringing in visitors they don't have to ask anybody but when it comes to responsibility you know we go back to you know what brother br Tau you know you you you you have a bishop over you exactly you know uh like a man comes from my church uh brother Branham literally say I become his Bishop yeah if he ministers to people who come from under him he becomes their Bishop exactly so it would really be necessary that we keep uh the order mhm the way brother Bram gave it to us I think we can live as a settled church amen amen I think well I couldn't I couldn't agree more and these words are really words of wisdom I know that uh many young ministers are listening to this and even to to this many years after this uh and I trusted to be and continue to be a blessing and still in that part of ministry because you see drawing from a man of an experience of 44 years plus uh I kind of feel inclined more to ask things regarding Ministry and um what is your and this I ask you but I know that it's going to impact the the listeners and they themselves will be able to um to do an inventory on their own life and Ministry uh what was your motivation in going out to preach and start a Ministry yeah uh you see one thing is I believed in winning souls for Christ and uh that's what solar I was one who would go out and be an evangelist and bring souls in and uh even when I got uh to believe the message that's the way I was looking at myself that I would go out here start a group and go and go here start a group and run away M that's what I really thought I wanted so I had passion for Souls that was Point number one so when I started the work down in ginger I knew I was going to leave and go but um um 1986 uh is when I started pastoring out in ginger I had a very little group of people and I thought like um I think after I've established them I should be you know going on and brother Harold came into my life at that time in 1986 and he says brother stevenh that's a mistake brother Bram was a prophet but he was to do the work of an evangelist he pastored the church MH they say it would be very profitable for you if you stayed in a place become a pastor take care of a people be able to raise an example that you are going to car around with you you know that you've got a church back home and he says that will open doors for you that will help you in your mission work you know because there is a problem brother BS we need to be open about it that uh um there's very little about evangelism in the message churches MH and uh that's very very dangerous yeah that is true um to them evangelism is preaching to our own children so that they can maybe believe or something like that the passion for Souls MH has totally been lost that was my driving force right when I was still in organization I wanted to see men saved and when I came into the ministry that's what I thought was my main goal to get men to the Lord Jesus Christ and then afterwards I kind of learned to settle and be able to nurture the men that the Lord had put into my hands so for the last 30 many years how many years now since 1986 you know I've been pastoring people and uh I've been doing Mission work and um you know different churches have been opened up and I'm really thankful that right now I begin to see the original driving force which were seeing so saved here amen well you see uh there some that say talking of predestination that God knows those who are he and you know and so we don't need to we don't need to evangelize they will come anyhow they will come anyhow what what do you say about that I say everything brother B Because with that kind of thinking then the Lord would have just come and stood in Jerusalem as a magnet and all the elect would come to him those who are predestinated life yeah would come to him you see that's uh it's very lame yeah yeah it's very lame it doesn't stand yeah even those who say so they get people in somehow they will share a book they will share a testimony they pray for somebody and somebody gets healed you see it's just uh avoiding the responsibility yeah but even those who say so the people they have they have had to bring them somehow exactly yeah you know the prophet preached someone convinced then concerned yeah I believe we should be concerned about this message and now uh how many churches would you I don't know if you've been taking inventory but like how many have started under your ministry for the past 40 years uh quite a number I know there's been quite an influx coming in recently yeah uh like how many cuz I've been hearing by thousands and maybe some have been hearing also and they would like to hear firstand from you today yeah um about what is happening now yeah the Lord has given us Grace brother BS and um it all started with our radio program M uh people listen to us M People call in and uh after some time there was a man who was heading a Baptist group of people and he had so many churches under him um he came to us and invited us and he said he wanted us to go and uh uh help help him speak uh you know in several meetings that he was going to organize around and little did we know that this gentleman had an agenda yeah because he wanted us to kind of cement his group together so we went in and uh I started taking seriously you know subjects on the name Jesus and uh what is redemption uh what's the new birth what's the blood you know all those kind of catch uh you know areas of the message and these people had never at all had this so we started organizing big meetings out of them we put in some bit of to get them together and uh after some time this gentleman felt like he's losing his people when he tried to back a track more than three quarters of all his people in quite a number of districts wouldn't be able to go back to him we started doing massive baptisms from those people and then eventually what is happening is that this man here believes he reads the books and then he says I want to share this with my neighbor here another Pentecostal or whatever Baptist you know then the next thing is he's calling you there's a man here who has believed he's pastoring a group of about 50 people or 70 people can you come and help him grow and then you know you end up then this one gets to that one is a multiplier effect a very big one and I can tell you that we get very massive meetings when we come together amen now there is a a thas side of it is it true mhm we always say come and see you see that's the only thing we say come and see yeah so we got War lots of people that have believed do we have some numbers in thousands praise the Lord yeah because this is me now the people that I'm working with if I can count we are working with people in about 20 districts yeah and this is me now and the rest of the brothers that are working around in this together with me yeah and uh you know you know the books you print they are swallowed by those people the Bibles you give us they are swallowed by those people and those people are continuing going on discipling others yeah so sometimes um some people may doubt a little bit we actually print over seven seven about 7,000 books a month yeah yeah but people can doubt a little bit and then the question is how can they believe unless they have seen they have sent somebody to them and they don't want to be the ones who are sent yeah so I say that many times um there is a concept that people have that Pentecostal don't believe they don't believe simply because what they give them is not the word yeah but if you take the word there's no reason why those people not believe you know we we we we take Christ at a higher order at a higher level you know most of these people who go out there uh they are not preaching Christ but if you enter into that place and you start preaching Christ at a higher level it's going to challenge those people exactly and they are going to say where do you get this from then that's when I start saying God has sent a prophet to this age amen amen you know but most of these people they go out and say God has sent to us a prophet I think that's the wrong way yeah the approach is wrong yeah the approach is wrong even brother Bram never sent us to preach him yeah that's true you see what I mean you take Christ and then out of that we give them the books yeah and I tell you it lights up their hearts amen yeah amen amen so going back to the message of the hour and I'll just take maybe about two three questions and I'll call it a quit but uh before then I'll ask those of you who are following us online if you have any questions please we'll ask you uh in the next few moments to post it we will take some time to to give those questions to the pastor so you can be able to answer them he's talked about many things regarding a Ministry regarding marriage and many other things that I'm sure you would want to ask about or if there's something else that you have not asked and you want to ask it please feel free to do that now going back to the message of the hour uh and this is just a straight up question yes what to you makes makes it the truth what to me makes it the truth yes the message of the hour you see one the message of the hour in itself it tells me where I am standing in time and you know when you look around when Christ wanted to prove a point he would point back and he would say this day this is fulfilled it's not a philosophy that's right and not just a theology but it's identifying God in season exactly you see what I mean yeah yeah when Christ came you know the circumstances that were around his birth for example you know it was very difficult for the people to believe he was a virgin born yeah but for those who believe believed you know they had look back at what that Christ was supposed to be so to me when I go back into uh the scriptures and I start looking at this season and what is happening and I can be able to say this day this scripture is fulfilled I can see that uh uh you know truth has been restored that had been lost in the apostolic age uh godhead baptism we have been restored to the knowledge of the original seed and all these kind of things and we go back into Acts chapter 3 from Verse 18 where it says that all this has been to has to be restored then so you look at the lining up of all the things that have been kept secret from before the foundation of the World being made brightly lit by the ministry of the Prophet then you really say it cannot be anything other than truth because he completely blends with the Bible amen yeah brother Branham never told things that he could not confirm by the Bible that's right so when I look at prophecy concerning the end of time and look at what brother Bram told and was able to be Vindicated at the same time then it makes this message the truth amen amen praise the Lord I think even this is what made Jesus Christ be the Messiah because when he came he fulfilled what was written of him yeah and even John himself when they asked they they they wanted to know who he was what he did he did he introduced the Messiah this is what Elijah was supposed to do so brother B in our generation has done what he was supposed to do he has fulfilled the scripture which was written of him yeah and more so not only theologically fulfilled but he was Vindicated yeah yeah he was Vindicated not theologically only yeah God is saying this is Truth by signs behind and wonders it's not signs like miracles of walking and so on but you know the pill of fire and many different ways God Vindicated his prophet in this season amen so it literally uh gives us a solid ground to stand on amen amen we we we we have um many that are starting Ministry and many that are already in the ministry for for a while but this question I want to ask you yes please I cannot ask this question to somebody like me who has been the message for maybe 10 years 17 uh I've preached personally the message 18 um 17 years this year um but you you have been in the message longer and I've preached this longer and so I would want to ask you that many have started out in the ministry for so long and then they give up they reach a moment and then they give up and now you being in the ministry for over 40 years and have the question is have you ever felt like quitting the pulpit and if so what is the staying power because you've stayed yeah uh any man who is in the ministry sincerely will always feel like quitting that's to be honest but when you look at the purpose of your call you ask God give me staying power amen the main main main main problem is ourselves yeah many times you see you are a very lucky person maybe you've never been dropped into the Hall of critics that's where you feel like you can quit yeah you'll always feel like I think I quit but then you come to a point and say oh no something I've done all my life you see I keep asking myself if I quit how you know what can I do because this is all I know to do I've never done anything else yeah you know it's your life yeah when you go to uh standing in the Gap yes brother Bram wanted to quit when you go to Bru the serent brother Branham wanted to quit and you see with brother Branham you look at this other side it's the criticism and then he says I cannot go he called them you know Ricky and Ricks and God says no I've got my people there and then on the bruised serpent it's people making him Christ yeah so on two extremes brother Branham wanted to quit yeah but most times a naturally you know Pastor like me you feel like you want to quit because of standing in the Gap brother BS the problem of every member of your church will be your problem MH that's true you see what I mean every failure of the member of your church will be your failure you know the people I was saying I was telling people that you know the last thing that you should ever do is to quit coming to church I said look at a man like a soul he came to church and whenever he came to church the ministry of the man he hated is what was healing his depression he didn't like David you know but David would strum that jitar and the Demons of hate indifference and all would you know leave Soul you understand what I mean so many times um you'll be up there MH and you'll know you are speaking to people and you will know because this is being open to you brothers that you are speaking to people and as you look you are aware of some people who don't believe you but they never leave the church yeah you understand what I me that yeah that's they never leave the church you know it tests your brotherly kindness yeah that's true so that you stand there with perfect love yes you understand understand what I mean so that you are not sidetracked MH and you make a sermon best on one man that's the most difficult thing in the ministry when you are out there and you know I'm speaking here but so and so and so and so and so and so don't believe me I used to go and preach somewhere um hundreds of miles from from here and uh get big big big meetings you know and um there was a brother in the area he would be sitting in the back when you are preaching this he says brother brandham said this brother Bram said this you know and uh you know it takes patience I don't care what he was saying I to really keep taking the people on those are the things that you really feel like you may quit yeah yeah you are going to a place and the best thing that goes ahead of you is the negative reports yeah those make you feel you want to quit like you want to quit is you know preaching is a call M if it was not a call one would quit but it's a call and you really feel like it hangs over on your heart so there are many many reasons why you really feel like why am I into the ring you know where you feel like you need to punch over the devil and then you get you know some other blows from the back those make you like you want to quit MH but impossible amen we have to carry this fight on up to the enden amen amen Paul said the why unto me if I preach not the gospel yeah and I've often spoken to younger ministers those that have nurtured um the few that have nurtured in the ministry told them that do not do not preach situation but preach inspiration because you find that many times ministers young ministers make that mistake in that um when you you find you get frustrated especially if people talked about you or somebody did something you did not want them to do and they in the church like you said they're in the church so that morning you'll change your sermon to be able to feeled that situation that's not right yeah you must know how have you handled that yeah um I've always is known one thing that God never enthrones a man he has not allowed to be tried yeah many times people talk about the trials maybe like the trials of job but the worst trial is the trial of the submission of your human Spirit yeah yeah that one is the worst battle David was in it for a long time when he fought the bear he to it when he fought the lion he toore it when he fought gorth he cut off his head but before he could become king there was a battle with his brother he could not use the same tactics he used against the bear the lion and goth very revealing he needed brotherly kindness my goodness yeah that's the last battle that the church will fight before it is totally enthroned talk a little more about brotherly kindness yeah what is brotherly kindness brotherly kindness is actually now listen you take me back to talking about state of a perfect man um you know in the state of a perfect man uh is a very powerful sermon you know and um I normally always connect it with perfect Faith uh it takes perfect Faith to start building uh you know the Pyramid of your life you know brother Branham used the pyramid simply because he wanted to present to us the fact that the church gets horned as it grows you see what I mean yes and then the Capstone at the top M but when he's literally teaching on stat of a perfect man that's not the same picture he gives us the picture he gives us is that God is building a house yeah and then he says faith is the foundation yeah then when he says he comes to Virtue he says that's the First Column mhm now when he says that's the First Column he's actually saying that's the first wall you know so he says you get your virtue add it to Faith he says you get your knowledge add it to Faith he's bringing everything down to Faith which means now Faith is a foundation which has got six sides to it exactly and then C it yeah with brotherly kindness yeah because I mean c it with Charity yeah because charity is the strength of all these virtues here yeah that's right charity is the strength that keeps the walls strongly held into the foundation yeah okay so that means that when you are building all these walls m you are building them anticipating that charity will come and so we go down to First Corinth 13 you know where he talking about if I have tongues of men and angels if I can sacrifice my body to be burned without charity meaning that charity himself which is Christ must come and stand behind every gift yeah for it to be the gift of God Amen so it's exactly the same thing that he does in the building of the living Tabernacle of the Living God Amen that actually brotherly kindness cannot work if there is no charity M because charity is the strength of all these so all these Seven Virtues is The Life of Christ manifesting itself in a Believer amen like he has given us Faith he has to give us virtue because he says add when it says add is not talking about your Works to go and look for knowledge and put it here but add is saying that add he gives to you to put it there put it there yeah so when you talk about brotherly kindness it can only be given by God amen amen so God himself gives us all these virtues and uh you remember David after the death of Saul M it was very interesting you know David stood and says isn't there any of the House of Soul that remains so that I can show him the kindness of God yeah David as a man he knew I've gone through a lot because of that house if there is any kindness that I can be able to pull out it must be the kindness of God the nature of God in Me yeah so brotherly kindness is a part of the nature of God yeah so it's one thing to preach it as a Doctrine and it's another to allow that living Stream flow out out of you will flow rivers of Living Water it has to be a virtue that is a life of God himself amen amen amen and I believe this is what we need in the ministry because without which uh we're going to look at ourselves as a Lonely Island yeah you know you find some people talking about brotherly kindness brotherly kindness but you see the more they speak of the poit is the more they hate M I think that's not the way God works you know so yeah well too much to learn in there U I believe our viewers can agree with me and please keep your questions coming in in the next few moments I'm going to read your questions and and all your comments or whatever you want to tell the pastor because we about to end the stream in a few moments now I will have one last question on my list here I would have had many more but of course I'll will let the other viewers well given their submissions yeah uh and this it appears we have handled it like I said you have a way of answering my questions before I get to them so that I I had another question here which as much as you might have answered it in a way but this will come direct says how how have you handled criticism from from other Ministry especially those who did not approve of you uh it's very simple very very simple you don't fuel your criticism you know uh when you answer you are giving more firewood to fun to fun you know what's going on um I've always thought this and God forbid that any man who is negative in mind is under atonment yeah and uh when a man brings out vents out he's trying to vent out you know his own torment so when a man is under torment you don't torment him you forgive him amen you don't give back you know when you start going on answering criticism you are going to to waste all the people's time all these people here they are not concerned about it you know you come to to to feed the people yeah you know you don't come to justify yourself before people you know uh people have got a right to say what they want to say because that's on the inside of them yeah yeah I don't feel that I I just keep going ahead I hate battles one brother BS I want to live in a state of mind that I do not need to come and repent and say I'm sorry I did this you would rather come to me and say I'm sorry but not me coming to say I'm sorry I wouldn't want to get into situations of running around I'm sorry I'm sorry and some people complain because I don't fight back they would have rather had you fight back said this man made feel better you you you never hear him you know you you will not hear him talk about you you know a brother told me so I and I I don't know why somebody would need you to fight because the call of preaching the gospel is not to justify myself or to destroy another brother but to lift up Christ that's so well some ministers they would rather fight the people back or the other ministers back especially on their pull pit because they fear they have fear that if they do not the people may run and you know go to to their opposit that's okay you see if the people leave then they were not part of what God ordained for me to take before the found I mean to take you know home with me yes yeah but um you see it's very unfortunate uh when ministers to begin with um begin to publicly fight one another I think maturity uh would help us one day I trust one day when the squeeze comes yes we shall need one another amen and uh I have seen this before that uh sometimes situations come and those situations teach us that we need one another we need one another yeah um if there people that I've learned that from I've learned it from you and I've come to a place where I realize I'm not a Lonely Island I'm just a little PE on the beach and the other day brother B before you continue the brother came to me and says oh this and that you been F I said why would you fight then he says oh these people say things on you I say keep quiet he looked at me and he said that requires a very big [Music] gift but uh we we have to we have to learn uh David changed his tactics yeah brother Bram says David had the ability to tear Soul's church if he wanted to yeah yeah he would even cut a piece of His Garment and just doing that it haunted him yeah I would say this will you permit me please please a little bit strong though please go ahead that I do not really see and understand why a man would directly shoot his brother MH to kill him and rejoice look at Judas Judas knew Christ is very powerful I'm going to take that money those people will not be able to take him when he discovered they had taken him he threw away the money and went and hanged himself H today you may be surprised that a brother can stab another in the back kill his influence and celebrate my goodness Judas wouldn't do that even Judas wouldn't do that so my goodness my goodness I think we should learn to really be to be you know humble and uh you know accommodate to one another yeah yeah not everybody is going to see things the way you see them yeah and the realization that that is so is a revelation on its own because I think ministers have a way of liking those that see things the way they see them and agree with them when everything yeah and I think there's something that you say that I've been thinking about for a while that uhu being in the church there can be a person or people that you know do not actually accept everything you're saying but they will not leave they won't leave and you as a pastor you would want to have everybody agreeing with you 100% that one will not work but it will never happen it will never happen yeah it will never and yet you have to feed everybody oh yeah including them including them yeah you know David had to feed so yeah yeah you have to feed them you know and uh uh generally listen Brothers Jesus during his last days of service here on Earth he says Peter lovest thou me and he says yes I do feed my Lambs you love me yes I do feed my Lambs you love me feed my sheep okay now I want you to see here that there is a difference between lamps and sheep every sheep has ever been a lamp but not every lamp has ever been sheep now lamps were used in religious ceremonies in the Old Testament it was always a lamp a lamp a lamp when Christ came he never became a sheep he remained a lamp a lamp a lamp but sheep becomes independent minded and Isaiah says all we like sheep have gone astray not all we like a lamp but all we like sheep have gone astray in church you will have sheep and you'll have to feed them amen independent minded people m M can I tell you something here sure sheep is a mob animal that if one sheep goes astray all of them will want to go astray I tell you brother B one sheep here can stray or will stray and you are going to be surprised how many sheep can fight back on you not because they are not children of God but they they've developed an independent mind mhm and by Nature sheep are M animals in tury there was a ship that went up on a cliff and jumped and then the next ship jumped and the man lost 1,500 Sheep by jumping themselves to death oh my God so you are a pastor oh feed my lamp feed my sheep so that we can maintain them trying to display the character of a lamb yeah yeah there are people that are going to come they just as smart as you are they think like you sometimes better you know you said this they say well if it was me and they'll be there but even those the shepherd Peter was told feed them amen amen a lot of wisdom a lot of encouragement a lot of instruction we really appreciate this um please we want to hear from you want to see your comments your testimonies and I have one from Sister Mari this is the pastor's wife from Ethiopia she's been following and she says enjoying so much bench this morning Elder Pastor IAL you you walk and surrender to uh to the Lord your work and surrender to the Lord is so amazing from the beginning um the min is submission to the leadership of the Holy Spirit I think you mentioned that so she was saying she was so um impacted by that by that Court submitting to the leadership of the holy spirit that it takes you to uh the ordained field that you are appointed to be in the Harvest amen very powerful Pastor IAL and uh then somebody else here says uh this is kma Moses says thank you Pastor pastors we are so blessed by the elders exaltation very deep words of wisdom and and uh this uh this is another one from a brother he's a pastor as well B Moses he says surely thanks Pastor T for bringing Elder Steven IAL for I'm really blessed by the way he brings out the things God bless you so much and this is a minister I would say within my rooms cuz he's also a younger a younger Minister and so you can see there's many other younger pastors and ministers that have been following and so there is another one called Joshua a brother called Joshua he has a question he says God bless you help on this there are a lot of groups in the same message like seven Thunders morning cry it ISC what do you make about that who is then the one maybe I'll let you answer that and then I'll give other comments yes sir now the Bible has 66 books m brother Isaac which camera should he look at cuz he's answering brother Joshua right you can look over the other camera yeah yes uh the Bible has 66 books but I can use Genesis to preach the coming of Christ his death and Resurrection without going into even the very acts of it in the New Testament you see what I mean so you know if a man decides to stay in Genesis and he sees Christ and presents Christ in Genesis that's okay this message here is different approaches preaching the same Christ the seven Thunders if they can be able to present that Christ then they don't have a problem if the morning cry can be able to present that Christ by that morning cry then that's okay but if a man stands in the Book of Genesis and he says the Book of Matthew doesn't take exist that's where the problem is you see what I mean yeah you know that's where I would say the there is a problem you know so I think um um or if you stand in the book uh of uh Genesis and you criticize The Book of Mark every time you stand up there's a problem yeah so you know I wouldn't uh be able to say much because uh sometimes I do not know the approach of the morning cry yeah you know I don't know the approach of those other people but my question would be are they preaching that Christ yeah can they bring forth that Christ alive and life transforming that's the most important thing amen it doesn't matter what approach you have but if it's being able to bring out Christ directly to the people and Christ having the in his body let them go on brother yeah so I think that's that's what I have for that question yeah amen well uh there is uh one brother brother Joshua brother Joshua this is another brother Joshua John AA he says great wisdom here thank you Pastor tala for inviting our Elder Pastor I I'm really being blessed amen man so then there is uh okay brother brother brother Moses I think is the one you are answering oh no no this is somebody else he says uh he's commenting on what he just said he says even Judas couldn't sell Christ and rejoice much respect sir so deep and deeper may God engrave it uh with an iron pain on our hearts amen and so uh this brother calb he says God bless you Pastor I'm really very humbled by the calm way he brings out points well that's what an elder is for he says God richly bless you Pastor I and uh so the there's um there's this thing question that I've been debating whether I should ask or not decided to leave it but I will ask it it's not doctrinal though it's personal what is your biggest regret in life and Ministry my biggest regret in life and Ministry is when I dropped my vision and tried to hang on another man's understanding MH that one was so big it shook my Ministry M yeah um you know sometimes let me say this and it help people when we get ministers coming through they help us yes and uh because the minister who is coming through should not sound like our pastor mhm he's totally different and that's why the pastor brings him because he sees he's going to compliment yeah the other areas maybe that he doesn't uh effectively work in so when you bring a man he's going to do uh a lot of uh uh effect positively on your people exactly and sometimes like maybe in the United States migration is very simple yeah the people just I'm moving to this state I'm moving to this state and when we are talking about States we are talking about a man moving from here and going to South Africa or migrating to Ghana you see what I mean and they follow that Minister and uh sometimes you find out that when you go out to that man and he continues preaching the way he preached it is good yeah but you'll find out that you are losing again another part where you came from so you discover you made the mistake transferring churches what was so good that day is not everything that you have need of mhm okay so um I came across tapes M and uh I went into for a spell of about two years MH into the seventh Thunder movement M but one thing is I thank God because I was a student of the word m uh when I had questions I had the ability of going back into the word and really get to see am I standing on the right ground I'm sorry to bring this up because you really asked me yeah I found out that I had errored in practice M and I said God have mercy mhm pulling back MH required a lot of humility mhm to say I was wrong and it caused a lot of friction because looks like you are opening up a Battlefront against a man whom you had decided to walk with that's the hardest thing I ever heard you know um to tell the people that associated with my Ministry M that I was wrong to accept the bashing that went with it yeah yeah and then the humility that I needed so that I can be able to restore the fellowship that I had lost from that day I said God when he call a man MH he tells him how to go amen and I always said I'll be obedient to the leadership of the holy spirit amen as he uses me amen as an individual amen from that day I don't do Group movement amen God gave me Grace I can only stand with what I see personally yes as the word amen well that goes out a lot to uh the young ministers uh because you see the Bible says that these things were written for our amples so if one and we appreciate you Pastor for your humility even to share that with us um because it is for ample yeah and we do appreciate it sincerely so um and this one I was supposed to ask it much earlier but somehow I also left it out and I'll finish with that um who was your Mentor in the ministry mainly who was my mentor in the ministry mainly yeah I will tell you the truth that brother Charles oio had a very great impact on my life he's a very humble man M he was my daily example we walked together and we did a lot of things together for many years and God forbid that ego is out there renewing his youth he's going through a very difficult situation Beyond this country brother Harold hilderbrand had a very great impact on my life amen we discussed a lot of international issues that affect this message and my advice to the young people always commit yourself to men that have got a track record amen of humility in service yeah that's very deep that's very deep and um one last one here from somebody I think if you have any more questions uh you've not sent them on time and I'm going to bring it to a close so I will take this one because because someone just sent it in Michael Scana you did not tell us which country you're coming from though he says why in the message some say Thunders and Seven Seals are revealed and others say that it is not yet revealed how can you help us yeah now you see when you go to Revelation 10:7 and it's the scripture that I'm going to read in this interview M if you allow me to do that yeah it is well I think brother Isa can also flash it on the on the screen Revelation 10:7 it's very very very interesting here he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound the mystery of God which is Christ should be finished as he has declared his servants the prophets so you know all the mystery that had been hid from before the foundation of the world should be revealed and the word which is revealed is Christ Christ MH he says Christ is those seals that was revealed brother Bram tells us so there is a difference between revealed and manifested they are two different things yeah so when we come to the seventh seal it's revealed MH but it's a continuing manifestation some of it is in the past tense some of it is in the present tense and some of it is still in the future MH it's a moving Revelation MH so when we say revealed we are not saying that all has been manifested there is more to that seal which is still unfolding because it keeps going and he says it's the end of time yes and as long as we are in time it continues to unfold yes and it's actually the opening of that seventh seal that opens all the other seals yeah because this seals is like roll yeah you know scroll you know and then put a seal then scroll you can't get into the inner unless you have broken the outer the outer one yeah so the outer one now brings forth the revelation of all these other seals amen so uh when we are talking about the seventh seal uh people are talking about specifics but there are so many things in that seal until brother Bram says it's like like a Roman candle and the Roman Candle that's what we call fireworks you know a bigger one comes out then smaller ones keep blowing out you see what I mean so um it is actually that's the world thing right now I always tell the people we are not dealing with Mysteries we are dealing with Revelation Revelation yeah I used to preach the mystery of this the mystery of this but then it looks like I'm just putting a seal on the word because all the seals were pulled back so we are living in the time of Revelation and I totally believe there was nothing left behind that could justify an eighth messenger amen amen well the person that asked that question said amen amen amen and I say Amen too amen now I have uh a few brothers that came up here and I'm going to allow if you could just come and stand right here and answer your question and then after that the pastor will will will close thank you so much Pastor TMA thank you so much uh Pastor IAL yeah it's a pleasure for us young people to be sitting in the presence of the elders we really get to learn a lot I have just a few things to comment on before I ask my question yeah I there something that you said about you know Judas feeling guilty after selling Jesus it really got to me to really know that there actually some brothers who are West than Judas you know please please it's something that is you know it's really strong but it's the truth it passes the point exactly it's it's it's the truth and um I I've read you know where the Prophet when you were speaking about uh the prophet and the Bible the message in the Bible when people try to separate this to you know personally I think it's people who do not understand the hierarchy of how God operat yeah because the prophet tells us that you look at nature you know it's a Bible on its own and you know it's like um uh it's a tree yeah and we are the end products of the tree we are the fruits of the tree yeah you know God is the life which is in the ground yeah so for that life that is in the ground to be transferred to the fruit in the tree yeah there's got to be the roots yeah which is the prophet there's a process yeah there's got to be the trunk M which is the and the the branches which is the fivefold ministry so before the life that is in God gets transferred to the to the fruits that in the tree it's got to pass through the prophet then the fire forward Ministry make more sense which is what actually the prophet says that the men that are coming after me shall make more sense it doesn't mean that there's no sense in it but they shall expound further on it so that the fruit can what can really get to the life that is on that on the tree also um the the pastor asked a question says how do you know that it's the truth you see you have got um how do you know that this is actually the truth separated from every other doctrine that is being preached out there a lemon tree might be very close to an orange tree but how do you get to know that this is an orange tree and this is a lemon tree yeah is when you look at the fruits there of so personally I believe that any Ministry that will bear forth fruits that are Bible fruits M that is a true Ministry there is nothing to dispute about that amen you look at the ministry of the prophet and the fruits that it has actually given forth that these are actually biblical fruits yeah that is going to tell you everything about the source of where that life is coming from amen a watermelon plant might look exactly like a pumpkin plant but how do you know that this is the true watermelon is the fruit that comes out of the plant yeah so basically you know it's people who are you know who really don't understand how God really functions yeah you know when it comes to these things and you spoke about brotherly love I love David as an example the most because there is a time when he wanted to Siege another city and the crippled of that City went and stood before him they rejected him and David said in his own words I hate the crippled yeah at the same time they saw who was a man that was against him and they came a time when he wanted to show grace to the house of Saul yeah and they came with a one called meib yeah but when the uh when Zeba was asked he said but King he is a crippled he knew that that the king hated cripples first of all secondly he knew that he did not he he despised not despised as such but he somehow had a feeling towards so house because of how they treated him and everything so this was two of the things that he did not like but he chose to take him and sit down with him at his table first of all he was from the house of Saul secondly he was a David did not like cripples but you know I wonder why then God would say you know David is a man after my own heart and and all those things and um uh the question that I have now is that there are times you know when a man every man that is called of God like you said you feel like quitting but but before you get to feel like quitting there's something that comes first is you even doubt the calling that God gave to you on your life you begin to think did God even call me to begin with before you get to the quitting part it's it's something that just comes and maybe the passes but that thought will pass through your mind you're like but did God really hey you know you ask yourself that question it's a question that even you know some young ministers we ask ourselves a lot did God really call me you know you're looking at certain things and like but God could God call a man like me you know with a past like this one and you know all these things that I've gone through then you feel like ah the Devil comes and Whispers and says man you were not even called to begin with you feel like you know what let me just quit you know how do you get through that first stage to begin with that did God even call me to begin with yeah um I from Zimbabwe yes sir good okay mhm yeah not not I just wanted to know uh I think brother that's genuinely right brother Branham came to those moments many times and uh what causes that is when you really feel that you are not breaking through any a Ministry that always talks about hi hi hi hi hi everything is uh me everything is good is working out and you know I doubt whether he's being honest many times any Minister will get so low you remember brother brandham and the Seven Peaks mon pigs he says two small ones and then a big one then another and then a bigger one then so you know all those seven pics they typify you know change of ministry and uh you know nobody jumps from one pick to another for you to get the next Peck you come down to the valley brother Branham went through those valleys many times and he says your ministry is written in those mountains every Minister before he gets to another Peck God brings him down into the valley of prayer amen that's where you are tested before you are promoted to the next Peck even our lives the chemistry of Our Lives itself brother Branham had those seven Cycles you know he would pray for people on the platform then excuse himself run to be seek in the bathroom then come back to the platform again you know and sometimes you get into those conditions he's taking his children to school he listens to the radio and then they are talking Evolution and then that Spirit comes and says yeah I think God is not there could you imagine brother Branham that thought passing in his mind then God came back to him again if God is not there then God started shooting questions at him you know what heals those people when you pray for them if God is not there then the devil changes his mind and then he says he's there but he doesn't love you so you know the whole problem goes back to Eve you know in the garden when God created Adam he came from the seed genin but then Eve came from the body and so he Adam kind of had that pill of fire the theophan presence that was going along with him and that was the protection of Eve but when Eve went to meet the serpent she had walked away from her protection and then that's now when the devil now says did God say then says yeah we you know not even to touch he says Ah do you know why because you will become like a God knowing good and evil God had given man one channel and that is knowing good but now here is another Channel of knowing evil and then Eve had no way to control that channel it just opened up she had nowh pulling back that door and she ended up to where she went so sometimes because of that kind of history and then the hybridization we come through that door keeps swinging on us and then sometimes you even doubt whether you've been called and you start doubt whether you've been effective in the ministry all those things and the main problem is when you start you know looking at other cities you know because when they looked at other kingdoms they came back and said H give us a king want to be like those Nations so sometimes we are kind of thrown into a state like the prophet he goes to to Oklahoma and he sees Hon's thing and he he goes down and he sees oh Roberts and then he comes back and oh God so all those things will affect our ministry but when those things cross our mind then we need to go back and talk to God in prayer and God reassures you you know uh he reassures you in certain ways you are my servant you know breaks this Revelation breaks that Revelation he gives you you know like you know Ruth in the farm he said throw some for purpose behind for her so that's what God certainly does but honestly uh before you quit you evaluate yourself when that mind comes why did I fail here why can't I be like so and so why did all those things come yeah thank you well thank you H I think I'll give the chance also to two other brothers thank you brother Prince uh brother musi and well brother Joel is also planning to quickly come yes God bless you sir God bless you my brother I am really blessed by everything you've said and to be brief about and this is a young Minister by the way from he looks like his grandfather by the way yes I knew his grandfather okay yeah we interacted together in the Pentecostal World wow amazing yeah indeed indeed I was T by my uncle that you really told him that thing I want to I want to talk about the thing you've talked about when when the pastor asked you about your greatest regret in your life and Ministry and you say that when you sat back and then you realized it you made you made a statement and you made up your mind to keep the individuality of your call in your ministry now I want to talk about it concerning with the young ministers that are coming up indeed we really love to stay under the the tutorship of the elders because we really learn a lot indeed we do but then it comes there comes a time I don't know but some maybe some people I don't know if they have found it but there comes a time when there's more of a friction in the way way God wants you to go and what you're being told to do I don't know whether I'm being understood so well but there comes a time when you feel a pull to do something or to do to go somewhere but then the leadership or the tutorship or the person you're looking up to is more of telling you or what the you're being told makes you not to follow the thing that you're feeling and I don't know how you conflicting yeah conflict yeah I I tend to understand now you are getting two things uh mixed together one is uh you wanting to go you wanting to do you see that comes now down to the management of what you have yeah and then there is which is the tutorship has nothing to do with the management of your gift so there are two things that the tutor will help you to enlarg your understanding and your relationship to the word that's his part the other part I think uh you need to accept what we call management of your gift yeah sometimes when you are a young man and you are growing up in the ministry there is a lot of excitement and especially you know you you you you want to to to Glow uh like the people should see the fire which is okay but one thing is a man who is tutoring you of course I want you to have confidence in him because you could not have given your soul to a man that you have no confidence in so you also should believe that he wishes you good and when you start to go out you know you are getting into areas that he has been before so he can be able to guide you and I think that any true and good tutor a pastor you know who's helping a Ministry to grow he has uh good intention for it you understand what I mean so you know that's what God told the prophet that if you could get the people to believe you this doesn't work only for the prophet but for all the ministry that you know if you can get the people to believe you so even the people when they can be able to trust their Pastor so there is that kind of necessity of trying to find a working method with your with your pastor because you know when he's mentoring you he's trying to see where your gift can be best used he's not trying to say now you preach like this you understand what I mean so I think that way you'll just discover that the conflict will only be on how to carry your gift but not on what he's giving you on mentorship so even when we are going out it's necessary that we be in harmony yeah uh it's very very important because you see Paul could commission people you know he says Timothy go back to such and such a place I you know and then he says I left my court there you know so you know they are moving under instruction and I think that's very important uh um I'm such an oldfashioned man that I believe in the passing on of the blessing uh Paul could not go you know I mean they said that let us separate Paul and and Barnabas you understand what I mean but Paul was called of God directly but you see it required him to come under the uh mechanism and order of the church and they ordained him for the work of the ministry and so you know it's very very important that when maybe you are trying to go out you know take the blessing of the church with you take the blessing of your pastor with you and if you are going out to start a church why would you just go without his Blessing you know it would be nice to keep passing on that Apostolic anointing from one man to another there's a reason why God did it to allow the hands of an order to really help you yeah I give you an example this is Elijah he's about to go he's passing over his anointing we've got jeu we've got Elisha and Jos you know something like that uh but uh all of them took the anointing from Elijah but then jeu which is very important for the young ministers uh when he went out he overused that anointing you see and God was not happy in the book of HOSA he says there will never be another of the house of oosa come into that place of Duty but he was using real anointing for Elijah but you see the ministers sometimes become so tough and so rough with a god-given gift you know and Destroy because this man says oh I'm now also going to worship bow who are the people who are going to be bow worshipers all of them so they all came younger children and everybody and he killed all of them you see this message is not given to us just to destroy but to give life so I'm sure that in that way you are in relationship with your minister and then he wishes you well then submit and I'm sure that a man who is taking tutorship knows what he wants to get out of you I don't know whether I've answered your question you've answered it God bless I believe it's going to help many of us amen I asked it on behalf of the many that may not be here yes that was perfect wisdom brother Joel do you have a question we really do appreciate that amen God bless you Pastor God bless you we so blessed uh my question is I believe that preaching is a gift and the Bible says that gifts and calling without repentance uh in the one of the in the message the prophet says that no man has a right to preach without the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah so clarify for me on that yeah certainly um no man has got a right to preach without the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's true and um I think any man who comes to the level of wanting to be a preacher should really have been concerned about am I really baptized with the Holy Ghost and it is something that he really seeks before he goes into that Ministry any meaningful Minister will have gone through that Junction because he knows that the ministry is not what you know but whom you know if the person is not there you are not taking anything we are taking the person of Christ to the people and that's now made manifest in Us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so what you say is very very right and uh in a man who desires to be a minister and feels a call upon his life of course this call comes even when you are still a child there is something that keeps you know touching your conscience at that time you start looking you know for God it's just like Moses realizes his call but it takes him another 40 years you know now the problem is sometimes um we are carried by enthusiasm like Simon you know he watched how Peter you know rebuked spirits and gave you know eternal life to people I mean the baptism of the Holy Spirit and then he says I've got some money here so give me that power that upon whose hand you know head I lay my hands so you know he was a gift on the other side you understand what I mean so he wanted to take this anointing and take it to that other side and use it for himself so you know uh but when Peter I mean when uh Moses got into the call feeling really like he has something to do just God himself if you are A God Called Ministry God will separate you to the back side of the desert it's just some kind of a a a feeling that will really get a hold of you and you really desire like God I feel like I'm burning you really seek for the bapm of the Holy Spirit you don't just need a shortcut like Simon you know yeah yeah thank you thank you Pastor now uh there's uh some other younger pastors that have just said is one wife been I think this is from H amen it says I'm blessed God bless you Pastor I and Pastor tala there's another Minister this brother has been going out to Cara uh Pastor EXA jeofrey says so encouraged God richly bless you pastors and there's also another one called Charles M says thanks brother B for these Arrangements we are blessed and God bless you Pastor I for the wise Council so uh Pastor EXA says Pastor I that's a special gift from God may he bless and anoint you more now uh allow me I know there are many other questions but after this I'm going to close my iPads I won't see any other question uh this one comes from yakob Hassan and he says God bless you dear Pastor what is your advice to this generation majorly on the two doctrines of tap Ministry only and the fivefold ministry I thought this is important and we could probably could deal with that before we close thank you um when brother [Music] Branham uh brought us this message God talked to him about storing the food and he put it on the types and forever and ever we have come this far because of the types how would we preach without those types and uh secondly I always tell people that uh if brother Branham was here he would not stop anybody to go out and preach and uh if he was here he wouldn't tell any of us that don't carry your Bible to the field just take the things that I've preached I'm sure he wouldn't do that so um always there is a problem maybe let me approach it this way that when God calls a minister he gives him sheep's food that doesn't mean mean that in the congregation there would be no Gods but he doesn't give him food for the gods the God so he gives him only food for the Sheep so what God gave us is sheep's food if people are trying to deviate from what God gave us the question would be are they gods mhm you see what I mean mhm yeah if they are sheep then they would desire the same food on the Taps but then the reason why people are saying only tpes only types is simply because they are trying to protect the people but who protects the people is it my work to protect you you know they are trying to protect the people from error but even God himself he knew there was hanania and there was Jeremiah you see what I mean God could not stop those men from prophesying exactly because the elect will never be deceived we've got enough food on the tapes and by the way I'm not against the tpes yes even playing them in church I'm not against it yeah but I stand back when you say therefore for the fivefold ministry has ceased because that one was given by by God himself it is sanctioned it's there in the Bible so you know we are told that if you take away from the Bible or if you add to the Bible so somebody must be very very strong to really say that from this day onwards Ephesians 4:11 is no longer part of the Bible M that would be dangerous and as long as it's still part of the Bible then I'm sure that God will allow me to preach up to the End Amen of time amen so you know I don't really think that we have another Junction we got the last Junction and the last instructions we had from Brother brandham are what we need amen yeah amen well to our viewers uh I think we've we are just coming to a clause uh we just titled this uh uh program the bench where we just sit on you knowes these benches and you know and just talk talk about the things of God and uh May main motive and purpose is really to impact the younger generation especially those entering into Ministry and other young people getting uh you know to understand what this message really stands for and what it is and how what we expected to do so uh here we uh talk to people like our Elder Pastor Steven who has lived a life of an example uh for the past 44 years in the ministry and has a lot of wisdom to share with us I just want to encourage you to take this link and share with whoever you feel it will be a blessing too we've been impacted here and we've we've fed we've sat under the oak tree and we are so blessed bless and uh before we we close I'd like you to just maybe give your closing remarks to to the viewers and uh just whatever that you feel on your heart to say yeah God bless you and uh certainly I've appreciated this opportunity um a man who doesn't always like to be highlighted so I was nervous about uh being invited before these cameras and talk to the people but um the min ministry as I said is just obedience to the leadership of the Holy Ghost and will certainly one step after another take you to your own God ordained fields in the Harvest so sometimes um we need to be satisfied with what God has made us because all of us will not be Bible teachers not all of us can be apostles but whatsoever part God has made us let us be satisfied with that that's the best way God would use us amen he has fitted Us in different ways and if your ministry is from God and mine is from God they'll always blend automatically yeah so I just want to encourage the young ministers that uh just keep obeying the leadership of the Holy Spirit uh when we believed there was no big examples for us to follow and it was very very good for us it was very good for us because there was no fields of competition at all yeah but U this present days you know uh young men always like to be like and it causes them a problem but just flow with the leadership of the Holy spirit and he will bring you to what he wants you to be so God bless you and uh uh keep the message and feed on the types and don't go into the extremes just keep going one day at a time amen God bless you amen thank you sir for the honor of having you today God bless you so much yeah God bless you viewers and we we'll see you again on another bench with uh with more men of God God bless you [Music] shalom [Music] for [Music]
