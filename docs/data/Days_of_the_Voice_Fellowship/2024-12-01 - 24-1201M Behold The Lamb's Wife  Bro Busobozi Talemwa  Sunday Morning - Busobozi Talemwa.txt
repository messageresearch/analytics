know if I forgotten one brother Daniel also is doing is into accounting yes sister peace is also actually she's finalizing her degree let us commit these people Lord Jesus you've heard all these names that have been mentioned since we have gathered all of us together here as Saints Lord we would like to take this opportunity to commit the needs of your people into your hands these children are going to be seting ex different institutions of learning different courses wisdom knowledge comes from you will you grant it to them Lord and give them boldness that they may be able to excel at their ex and at the end of the day the glory and honor shall go to your name Grant it father in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord I think I have one or two more things say and then to the so our service will be a little extended we will not finish at one as usual I hope you will be understanding um there is um something going on in um some time back when brother shame was it all started with shame going to uh that College that institution the flying school and so um then he started some kind of fellowship and so I was always going there I think it was once a week and it was a good thing because many people had the word many loved it and I I don't remember but I I know several were baptized sister f happens to be one of them and I know some people have thought maybe shame preached to her so that he can marry her as your pastor can stand here and as a father also of sh and declare to you if I even sense or smelt it I would not have supported him in marrying her why because I would know it won't work out we don't believe that someone you should convert someone for you to marry them we believe God should convert someone for you to Mar you understand it is possible for you to reach out to someone preach to them they believe you and then later on without even you planning and then you end up marrying but these days people very wise they even they can tell now you go to DF that you know me and then you just go there Bap and then the young man maybe is going to and then later on the girl is baptized two months later the young man comes in the church there's a sister in your church that I have loved which which one of them sister so and so know the sister but she's a new believer pastor this one has finished me I know I've seen her you know that is you know it is you know like being a supper you know you are not working right you will bring by the way you think you are faking pastors but you will bring trouble to your own home and you when it comes to marriage don't play yes Brothers I think you have to tune sound is not really good so don't play with marriage let God lead you in amen and so sister Fe was one of the people that really believed and um there was another young lady I don't know where she is now um and the many more things coming out because of that so well of course they moved they got married and moved to an and uh you remember there is a sister Ruth is not here this morning but she one time here prophesied and uh to several brothers and Sham was one of them and he said that it was something about your ministry lining up yourself and hearing from God and being sure like that and so they prayed about it to see what um and the it was to do with the ministry well later on as I told you some time back the Lord would continue to show brother Shame about the place that he was supposed to go to um there was a church which he will receive and the people there will receive the message and so he came and shared with me I told him do you know the place he said yes I know the place but I don't know any church there I said well if God says something he will accomplish it if he said it is a church you keep looking maybe your eyes are not seeing proper whatever God tells you if he says you're a millionaire and you don't see yourself as a millionaire believe what God say you may not see it but it will surely come to pass and so later on one day they were driving past the place and they he called me very excited he said I've seen the place exactly the way it was and um so he walked in there and like he saw in the vision he was received so today I'd like to say that God has been doing a good work and he has been how many times have you been received there to minister they've been going there every is it every day or every Monday the full week every morning every morning is it for one one week no more than yeah so for about a month they've been going there and U so the good news is there are several people there who have decided to be baptized amen and the better news is some of them are here this morning Hallelujah I have not met them yet so can you stand if you're here if you're from that institution the Lord hallelujah God bless you amen this is not about our church about shame or about them it's about the word amen it's about Christ revealing himself to his children amen and so we will be baptizing them right after the service I know there are more and will be looking forward to have them God is doing something in something is happening there and um in the Same Same Spirit there's a brother who has been following our services here for a while now I think for about a year I'm not to sure um I did not know him but one time he contacted me and then we lost contact again but I did not know he was still following the online services and uh so um recently he came and we had some fellowship and told me that the Lord was leading him to come and be mentored by this ministry and be a part of this ministry well I I always told you I believe in the leadership of the Holy Spirit and if the Lord uh if someone tells me the Lord is leading them to do anything I want to stand behind that amen I would it is better I find out later I was wrong than to hinder the Holy Spirit and I find out I was wrong about it and so there there have been several messages and visions and dreams all I can say is that the Lord has led this young man and he's a minister of the Gospel uh and I did not I had never had him preach so I did not really know what type of person he is butth I saw met him on Friday and is the brother who ministered for us here on [Music] Friday so I I I now know most of you who are here on Friday are clapping because you know amen and so brother Julius also here this morning if you can stand up and we to the people we say we receive you my brother in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this young man is also from he's not yet married so my daughters be careful don't don't overlook don't overlook don't overlook praise the name of the Lord it is a young man who is supposed to look amen some sisters be like brother are you not seeing me and today I'm going to speak on a subject to do with marriage and things like that family and so I have another pastoral message this morning so I pray that the Lord will help us so brother Julius is also from I don't know what God is doing but I'm seeing something happen I believe when God is about to do something it's like a puzzle he is the one who makes it happen not you the man praise the name of the Lord amen so we can we now stand for the reading of the word so I just um will speak for 1 hour and a half so you can look at your time now don't look at it later and then you amen it is 12:12 I'm happy to see you brother Andrew it's always a pleasure to see you in church bless you amen Revelations chapter 21 and for our youth meetings I'm happy to inform you for now we have three uh brothers who have confirmed to come from America and one from Zimbabwe so God is uh bringing his own ministers to preach some of them I I not even plann for them to come you are in this church and you have not yet registered you are making a very big mistake register yourself so you can help us to plan and also invite others to [Music] register I don't know brother I don't know whether you have one of those things to register maybe later on after the service you can project it the website is dvf fellowship. o.org df.org d v Fellowship DV Fellowship o r so when you go there you will see how toister for you they warming up to come from All Parts it's going to be a wonderful time please pray over it and also prepare yourself those who pledged fulfill your pledges and the Lord will bless you so we reading only verse 9 and then we shall be seated let us first pray Lord as we are going to go now into your word change the order of the service a little bit Lord we ask that you will help us Inspire us and speak to us today Let Your Presence overflow by the preaching of your word in Jesus name amen I'm reading verse 9 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hether I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife Amen Let us also read Revelation 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God amen the believer say you may be seated please last uh on the overnight uh brother Julius came along with a friend I had some time with him from after the preaching through for about two hours and I'm glad to announce today he's also ready for water [Music] Bap this young man is also from praise the Lord amen so this this morning I want to speak to you on the subject of behold the Lamb's wife if you are receptive receiving the word I'll finish the subject if you you are moving around and disturbing the spirit then I may not finish I love it when people are seated and listening receiving the quietness of the spirit then God comes and speaks to us it's not about me the preacher or The Interpreter it's about your reception and then God coming down to minister to you so let all your thoughts now pause them or stop them put it aside let us be into this 100% that is 10% of you let us be into this 100% amen thank you for that so this is like I said a little kind of pastoral message um where we we get into more details read a few things you know may not be one of those messages where you just you know uh say hallelujah amen sometimes it may be you to just sit back relax and listen and um of course rejoice as you are he the behold the Lamb's wife the scriptures I have read have a lot uh but I only want to take one portion just one line in Revelation 21 he says come he I will show thee the bride the Lamb's wife so the lamb has a wife amen before I continue I want to say I am she amen the church is the wife of the Lamb so don't try to figure out that's it that's what I'm talking about now he says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready so when we talk about the wife of Christ the Lamb's wife we are not talking about the whole chrisan chrom all denominations no please listen not all so-call Christians are the wife of of Christ well they claim to be but that doesn't mean they are he has a wife he recognizes if you want to understand it then you you you go and study the Book of Esther there were many types of women that were prepared to go and meet the king there was only one called the wife I will talk about about that a little bit later on but maybe just to give a little bit of opening here we see that there was a group that went and this there were three different types the first the place where the women were kept those who have never met the king and there was a second group those who have never met the king would now be you know promoted or would progress and go to meet the king but before they met the king they were asked a question do you have anything else you need maybe they would say yes I need some eye pencil I need some makeup I need some earing I need some extra this because I want when I see the king I want him to fall in love with me I want to attract him I want to look so beautiful I want to look so irresistible oh one time we'll talk about that book of and then the these women would all come and go to the king one by one but you see as they came one by one they were rejected one by one but there was another woman this woman was a Jew and her name was Hada and you know she was given the name Esther but you see this woman when also hard time came and they her what else what other thing do you need she would say I want nothing all I want is the KY all I want is the KY throw away your makeup throw away your eye pencils throw away your earrings throw away your lipstick all I want is The King and I know the King when he sees me he will love me for who I am amen and I when I see him I will love him for who he is Take Me To The King and Esther came and when the king saw his oh the King was smitten in the house hallelujah oh my praise God the King was smitten the king loved her the king amen received her and immediately the king took her for a wife him and the other women when they left the king they went into another house they did not go back in the house of the virgins they now went in the house of the contant because the king had seen them but the king had rejected them he did not have desire to have a further knowledge of them so he sent them away and they went into another house where they had another chamberline who was taking care of them and you know that is the house of the con and now these women in the house of the con you know they would never ever be given a chance again in the presence of the king why because the king did not desire them amen but you see the king kept flourish you know giving them all the gifts they needed because they had met the king sound is I'm still struggling you know because they had met the king you know they did not they were they were not like the others who did not meet the king so the king gave them gifts every day so their work was listen to me now their work was to Simply wake up in the morning and open gifts open gifts gift after gifts gifts after gifts but they will never see the King again I don't want to be that kind of woman who has all gifts but I don't have the king and we have those spiritual groups today praise the Lord that's better brother sh we have many of those women now remember woman is a type of a church you know they have all gifts they can heal the sick they can you know the lamb can walk the blind can see they but they don't have the king because the king is the word Jesus is the king and the Bible in the Book of Revelation says his name is the word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the only Glory begotten of the father full of GRA and so who is Jesus Jesus is God in flesh Jesus is the word Jesus is the king are you hearing me now we not is that these people have the gifts of Jesus but they don't have Jesus the word amen but here was another woman and her name was Esther es received the king and Esther had full access to the king 247 and if you have access to the king you have access to all his gifts everything he has to offer you have access to listen the true bride of Christ does not go seeking for miracles 90% of church people today this morning they have gone in a church they seated in a church because they want a miracle let me tell you the true bride of Christ does not go around shopping for miracles I will tell you what she will be like in Mark 16 the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe what do they believe they believe the word they receive the opening of the word the signs and wonders the Miracles the power it has to follow them but they will not go looking for it rather just believe the word the Miracles will follow amen receive the word the word all the time every time of your life and God has to back it up with miracles signs wonders power and we see Esther was the true wife of the king amen and so the Bible now says let us be glad and rejoice amen and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come Jesus is the Lamb of God that takes the of the world but lamb also points to the sacrifice he he B his wife with a very expensive price that no one could pay and so his wife his wife which is his true church has made herself ready and to her was granted that she could be arrayed in fine linen clean and white blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supp of I want you to see here in the book of second Corinthians chapter 2 sorry chapter 11 verse 2 you know Paul says for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I am I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chest virgin to Christ so now Paul here under the anointing tells the Corinthians that that I have espoused you I have engaged you to one husband listen Church the gospel is all about marriage we are being married Amen to Christ we living the old husband AC the new husband we are we are leaving the the devil and accepting Jesus as our new husband amen we are living one headship we are living one which is the headship of the devil when the devil is your head he is your ruler he is your controller he leads you everything he tells you you do and how does he do that through your flesh so for you you do anything you want to do every Temptation that comes your way you are just defeated because you are under the wrong headship but let me tell you Brethren when you accept Christ and you receive the power of the Holy Ghost amen you you change headship you are now no longer under the old that's why the Bible says all things are passed away behold old things are new I am crucified amen with Christ amen and I don't live anymore the one you see that live it is not I that live it is Christ who lives in me I am now having another Ed he's in me controlling me guiding meing the say when he listen the spirit of truth shall come what he will guide you to all he will show you things to come he will you know he will guide your life because that's the work of the Holy Spirit he comes to rule over you praise the name of the Lord and when you are under that head the flesh can no longer overpower you am I preaching to people who have experienced that if you are hearing me and the flesh is still overpowering you you have an invitation today the moment you accept and you baptized in much water after true repentance then amen Christ will fill you with the Holy Spirit there there that is the life that is the power to overcome sin that is the power overcome the world and your friends will ask you how come you can't live like us we want to be like you how do you do it it is not you that does it it is Christ in you that is living the life his life his character his power I am so tired of the Gospel that you know it sounds so good but it's so powerless where people speak like Angels but they live like demons when im spirits come they sweep them like the because they are so powerless I found a gospel a gospel that is the power the Bible says amen I am not ashamed of the it is the power of God and salvation it saves me saving you means redeems you from the clothes of the enemy the hatred dies fear dies immorality dies and you know bad thoughts die wrong desires die and even even if you had an appe for alcohol or for smoking and cigarettes you feel you don't have the desire anymore hallelujah hallelujah amen the brother told us the other day he was even going in shrines you know imagine someone who is there I don't know where they did but you know I don't what they do there you know but I know one of the things they do they smoke P people who imagine smoking a and all your your teeth is red Y and you are under the clothes of the enemy you know brother I don't care what condition it is when you receive this gospel amen it converts you it is a power that changes the timing amen whereby now you are controlled by a different Power the desire for the things you used to have dies everybody said dies it dies completely it dies believe it brother believe it it dies don't say it dies but this one everything dies all things change everything changes when Jesus comes in your heart he comes to abide he comes to stay he doesn't come to visit he comes to stay and when he stays every day you walk it is not you that is working it is Christ working in your life you are a Christian Church in your bedroom at your school Everywhere You Are your work place you are a Christian hallelujah hallelujah today I feel I have a lot to say I just pray really sincerely I ask that you pray with me as you hearing the word be in prayer let God bring forth what he wants to be and so Paul says I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chest virgin to Christ Paul wants to take us and introduce us to our husband oh my good Lord he does he doesn't want to present us are you hearing he wants to present us as virgins so you mean Jesus is not marrying an immortal girlus wants [Music] vir glory to God well if you don't agree with me then you fight with the Bible because the Bible I may present you as a chest chest virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent guide him through his City so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ are you hearing me Christ is going to marry a virtuous bride now there are two different women there is a woman of virtue that the Bible speaks of in in Proverbs 31 but you see the woman of proverbs 31 is the kind that did everything to become [Applause] virtuous she did that she W up in the morning she cooked for everybody struggles she does this she does that and because of that she's virtuous but you see that's not the kind Christ is coming for but he coming for the woman I should say of the Book of Esther es oh my praise God is a true representation of Grace unmerited favor she did not deserve it she was worthless she was not a good one even she not have any good thing on her but you see the king loved her all the other women tried to do something but eser refused it all she said the king will see me as I am just as I am I come to you the true brid it's got to be served by Grace not by works that's why our message is not the message of Works our message is the message of Grace what is Grace Hallelujah Grace is receive the Holy Ghost amen when you receive the Holy Ghost amen now you have the power to do the works of Grace the Pentecostals are preaching another type of listen carefully they are teaching that do whatever you want to do Grace will abound Grace Grace Grace uh youor don't just come with your mins it doesn't matter how you dress is available that is disgrace it is not Grace you are smoking you committing a doubt you are doing you are going to Club imagine a Christian you in CL imagine it right now you're a Christian it is a shame and then when you come to church your pastor tells you no problem will for you Christian and you're drinking alcohol and then afterwards you listen to your pastor you are drunk said don't worry is enough and then you begin is in the name yet you are drunk the Bible says drunkards will go to Hell Fire are you listening and now so the Bible does not contradict Grace does not allow us to sin but Grace picks us while yet we are s [Music] and he brings us to himself he does something that is called justification he brings us the way we are but when he brings us he begins another work hallu come on he begins the work of sanctification he begins to was he begins to cleanse he begins to kick out every he begins to remove everything and then he's not yet done while he's at it is preparing your heart Amen to remove the very root of sin because listen someone can be Sanctified no longer doing the bad things but the desire for those things still there so when he has a chance will go back again like a dog that goes back to his let me tell you that when he is finished with you listen it is impossible to go [Music] back right now be careful about the things I'm saying because I feel the presence of hope God it is the truth it is impossible to go back why I will tell you why because when he himself amen has finished to do justification sanctification then he himself he comes and dwells in the of your in you in you in the midle of your soul comes and takes the Throne of your heart and now he kills every desire your flesh will desire those things but your soul cannot desire them and that is why we live overcoming life why because the flesh is weak but there is a power in us the Bible says that is in is greater when the Holy Spirit is on the ins he overcomes he subdues the Flesh and he makes it powerless he makes it sleep and it can no longer overpower you that is Grace when you receive the Holy Ghost you re re the Grace from that time on the things you do the works you do everything is different from what you used to do why because he's the one doing them not your works anymore can you say Amen not your works anymore it is his work now in you he is coming for a virtuous bride one that has received Grace let me show you something go to Esther 5 now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner Court of the King's house over against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal house over against the Gate of the house and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the King held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand so Esther Drew now and touched the top of the scepter then say the king unto her what Willl thou Queen Esther and what is thy request it shall be given thee to the half of the Kingdom praise the name of the Lord now I want you to see this is very extraordinary amen you know there was a man I think he was called was he called one who wanted to kill them yes and H wanted to kill them and there was another man called was a Jew the uncle of Esther and um you know the queen no one could see the queen because the queen was living in a chamber let me tell you and I'll write quote something in if you're married or if you're not yet married same thing if you're married no one has a right to your body let me tell you if a man if you're married your sisters are married and a boy looks at you smacks at you and then you also you have a bad character you ought not to do that that's a bad character why it means you have a spirit in you how can you smile and and and wink at man another man who is not your wife and you say it's all right under which terms now the queen is always kept away from all other men even the men who serve her are castrated they are Chamberlin they un that's how it was oh a symbol pastors are taking care of the wife of Christ but pastors are not the Lords over the flock no pastors have no seed of their own we are representing him like a chamberline we have no seed of our own to give to you we only have the seed of Christ to lead to you so a pastor in himself you don't follow him because of he himself no you follow pastors because they following Christ and they're leading us to Christ the moment they stop we stop you all are here because I believe the word and I preach the word I tell you if I changed and I began preaching wrong things I believe you will walk away and you'll be justified and I want to announce to you today you should never feel sorry for me if I leave this world for your souls and walk away you didn't come here because of me you come here because of what I represent because of the word hallelujah I am only a steward pastors are stewards but these days me I die with my pastor with my you stand with the word [Applause] you stand with a man who has left the word you go to hell stand with the word praise God Pastor people are going to not love you don't worry if I preach the word they will love me hallelujah amen we are not here to capture to receive the spirit of the pastor we here to receive the Spirit of Christ and we see that the queen was kept away from other women and other men no one could see her not even the uncle because she was a queen listen church we are Queens we are the Lamb's wife we should be kept away from all isms and Creeds and dogmas of man we should only be available to Jesus Christ amen and so you know the man M you know started you know he dressed in in what you would call rugs and then he came in this in the place in the palace and that was bad so people went and told him because he wanted to get he wanted to get the attention of the queen are you hearing me and so the queen heard about it he told them go and tell him press up he had the clothes give it to him he's ashaming me he can't do that and then later on he had new he said I will not dress I will not dress so they told the queen has refused said why what is happening ask him what's wrong he said we are dead we are finished H wants to kill all of us said what and and and and and M told her don't you maybe you've come to a kingdom for such a time as this for such a time as this brethren we have come to the kingdom for such a time as this when the spirits are going around the world are going around the world some people young people love saying you it was easy for you but for us it is very difficult you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this because God wants to accomplish something but he wants to use you everybody say me you have the power to overcome all the Demons of hallelujah amen hallelujah young lady when all the others are wearing lipsticks and make up and they look like Jezebel of the Bible you know what happened you know the women of that time we are not doing that thing but Jezebel was not a Believer she came from another land she was a pagan let me tell you right here makeup is not a sign of civilization makeup is a sign of paganism even here in Africa before civilization we were making up both men and women you don't know that you look at all the ancient tribes you know they would pain themselves I don't know how they would make those things maybe from plants and and then from Blood of chicken and whatever and then they begin painting themselves put things like cut sometimes you know cut cut and even cut part of the ear whatever as a sign of makeup you know but you know even in America and Europe all the ancient tribes and Australia wherever it is that where in their paganism they used to make up so was the tribe of Jezebel they were pagans they did not know God and that's why they were making up but you see when you become a Christian a of Jesus he delivers you from all paganism he takes those things away and when all others are doing it you cannot be attracted to those things why because Christ in you she just rejects it you know Jezebel painted herself and she would come in a mirror for men to see her well she was supposed to be A's wife the king but she didn't care she wanted other men to see her and it's the same Spirit today a woman canot paint herself when she's going to bed you have been shouting by now she cannot paint herself when she's going to bed she cannot paint herself when she's at home with her husband why your husband doesn't need makeup but why do you paint yourself when you are going outan immoral spirit that wants other men to be at you and you know the children of God no matter what generation they are in even before our generation they have always hated that thing why because the spirit of Christ rejected amen it's not an immoral spirit I tell you younger sisters don't worry God has given you the power you have come to the kingdom such a time as this amen we are in a generation where we have homosexuality let's bism and all the spirits are roing around they roing around let me tell you they will fear no one they will fear no place they will only fear he that is protected under the blood but can I say something tonight we have come to the kingdom for such a time as to overcome those demons come on to sh their heads off shop their legs off their hands off to live above them they cannot defeat us because we are under the token we are the Lambs wi hallelujah amen don't accept any of these demons to subdue you and you are women and you wearing trousers very soon I'm speaking on that as a subject because I've seen in the realm of the spirit there is a spirit going around within the message telling girls it is okay to wear trouser the Bible does not sayar the Bible does not say you should not wear all right we shall see we will get into that but I tell you this this morning true Daughters of God will overcome that Spirit yes sir I remember traveling um several airports with my wife you know she she sometimes has very long dresses and sometimes she has those ones which are little like what you would call a party dress and and not too short but below the is but now when we would want to travel she always tells me dear let me dress the very long one so that I will preach the gospel and one day we were at a certain airport and there was this group of women skin tyght jeans and others mins and and for her she was dressed in her [Music] gown and with the children and with me with some of the children and those women could not keep their eyes off of her what do you think she was doing she was showing them I am the Lamb's wife I am different am a person that this world is not worthy of the Saints of the Lord in every generation have been people the world can't understand they have done different things and because of that the world has always hated them but you know what they still stood they still overcame they still had testimony because they were the Lamb's wife and so we notice Esther here and you know she had the news because they want to kill us said the devil is joking all of you let us fast let us pray three days and night and then on the third day eser she there was a law you could not walk to the king without an invitation not even when you are a queen but knew Hallelujah tell your neighbor I know I am tell them I know who I am hallelujah hallelujah I am the Lamb's wife I am the wife of the king I cannot be denied amen hallelujah deserve to die by walking towards the king uninvited she deserve to die but there is one thing she had Grace Grace and Merit favor she had grace before the king and when the king chose her amen she was the embodiment of his character the fact that he chose her demonstrated that she would not be denied she had access someone say I have access come on say loud have because she was a woman of virtue come on now come on enjoy church this morning we have access because we are women of virtue I am a woman of virtue spiritually speaking now the church we are all women you know there's a scripture that says beloved now are we the sons of God but now some sisters feel bad what about us are not Daughters of God but don't worry now the service is yours today we are all women now women of virtue our virtue comes from his grace hallelujah amen and as the queen began walking you know hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord where is my queen is she down there all right come help me to preach today if you don't come quickly I'll get another one slowly praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord just stay there hallelujah hallelujah you see how she obeys that's how Queen is supposed to Hallelujah Hallelujah and as he was standing amen amen and and and and everybody was watching and you know she could not walk in Uninvited she could not do that but now as she started walking coming close slowly working as a woman of oh my God I never you married the princess come on walk closely and as she was walking and the King he was speechless she has gone against my L life is wor but he remembered he remember who she is stay right there he remember and the Bible tells us here now it came to pass es put on her Roy and stood as you standing in the inner Court of the King's house against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Roy house over against the Gate of the house and it was so when the King saw Esther the queen standing in the C that she obtained favor in his sight amen she obtained favor in his side and when she know she obtained favor in his side you know the King was seated there your Chamberlain you just stand and as the king was Seated on his Royal Throne you know when he saw her oh I love that when he saw her some men when they see their wives they don't get attracted anymore they don't get attracted anymore but I'm so happy to see my I don't care what you see me I see beauty you are saying she's too short that's none of your business she's my queen Hallelujah am and when the king saw her don't worry I'm preaching yes but I'm also happy because of my wife when the king saw her she automatically obtained favor his and he quickly picked the septer and he put it up and the queen be when he saw that she began walking closely coming close to him come on my queen she began walking and she touched the tee of the scepter the tip of it hallelujah hallelujah you see how it was it must have been a lovely s and the King said to her what do you want ask anything even half my kingdom I'll give it to you talk about being drunk with love swe what do you want go God bless you God bless you hallelujah hallelujah my my my my and said the king said what will you what is your request it shall be given to thee even to half of my kingdom deserved to die but she had one thing she had Grace unmerited favor when a man chooses you for wife you have obtained favor in his sight when the king chose her she was the embodiment Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the embodiment of everything the King was of his character the fact that he CH her demonstrated he can never deny her she had access because she was the woman of virt but V refused now I'm going to read for you something which I've not read before this was preached in the year 1965 how many were born then one two only two hallelujah amen 1965 preached a message called marriage and divorce this is a very old message but I'm going to quote from it I want this is a man of God that God used in a mighty way and listen to what he said these people they used to say the way it is without fearing how it and today I'll read you a few of his cour listen but a priest could not do that because he had touched oh got a woman to be his wife that was already he could not get a woman to be his wife that was already touched by another man because that would be another man's wife because that shows the VY of the the vcy of the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ the bride will have to be unadulterated the word not one word missing nowhere certainly could you imagine a correct bride one breast off could you imagine that how many brothers would marry a sister with one could you sister who raised up hand sister but if you were a brother you would not one bre off and the other one you know having something another wrong you know that's not going to be the bride of Christ she is perfect she is everything the word no she's everything the word my wife is everything me why to you if you take to my wife thinking she not tell me she tell me everything by the way be careful of married people whatever you tell one another will that's why brother said when God calls A man also calls his wife sometimes I'm surprised when sisters are surprised when they when they ask to meet me and they find my wife wife there but Pastor they will not say because she's there so they will look at me look in other words but I wanted to see you alone if you need me my wife will be there she's a part of me are you hearing me church when God calls a man he also calls his wife she everything the man is and you find men who talk against their wi these ones have they need to be straightened because whatever you speaking about her it is you my wife is very dirty by the way you also dir that is why she's also dir my wife is a hard woman it means even you you are very hard my wife doesn't pray are you the one who prays don't to us as a matter of fact men women who even pray more than them I told you today I would speak pastoral things if I had someone I don't mean it I just want to straighten you up that's you see she's perfect she is everything the word not one word failing anywhere are you hearing Church you have to keep getting your amens coming not one word failing anywhere notice he can put her away but she cannot put him away now here I wanted to think spiritually he did it has proved it in the days when Lu wi and Pentecost when they the denominations refused to become the father part of him having spiritual sexual fear to become pregnant with Father part of the word denominations they refused like refused the King was there and happy with his people and then he said call me my wife let me display her you see her beauty imagine me calling my wife and she said the queen said I will not come I tell the king I also have a party with my friend rebellious woman and that's how it was when the king had that she was so sad so sad sisters always don't be rebellious to your husband your husband is your lord before you think about God think about him that's what the Bible teaches now she was rebellious remember this type the church and Christ he is the word but the church today the denominations they have rejected him by rejecting the word they read in the Bible baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they said we shall do father son baptism of someone after they have believed for us we shall use God fathers and do babies and then you bring women are not supposed to be pastors but what are the churches to they say for us our women are called they are anointed they turn down the word they refuse to accept the word and they take their dogmas they their churches are their own parties I want to be on a party where the king is present hallelujah amen when the word is preached the king is in the car the king is present but when the woman the church is rebellious the King was so sad and he told his chamberline what can I do they said Oh Long leave the king this woman has been rebellious therefore what you should do chase her away divorce her and marry another one so what the king said why I love her said no if you keep her all the other women will do the same that's why go to a church where you find a pastor's wife rebellious which look like if she if she pierces your eyes will come wearing the Min when she sits you just see everything and then you know she comes on the praise God who is she first lady pastor's wife the pastor is the bishop this one is the woman Bishop yes I don't see any in the Bible by the way and just in case you don't know First Timothy 3 the Bible gives the qualifications of a bishop he a husband of one wife so Bishop is not a woman there's nothing like a woman bishop and Bishop means Pastor nothing like a woman pastor and the Bible says he must have his house under subjection he must rule his house well even his wife she should be an example but where you have a church like in that situation whereby the woman well she doesn't say she has rebelled but by taking and assuming a position that is not given to her by the word she's a rebellious woman and you know she comes and praise the Lord church and one brother told me there is a day they came to church and you know the P had gone to visit somewhere so that day it was the sister preaching but you know these brothers the brothers now those Andrews all these others the brothers who minister in the church when the P was not around the sister took over as usual so now she was so angered and because they came late she was Spitting Fire she descended on them on the ppit you are stupid you don't have any knowledge you are not respecting the anointing because she's in the wrong place one brother told me those when I told him a woman is not supposed to be a pastor I will take you even a scenario you see this woman she's rebellious because she has refused to take her god-given place and she has assumed responsibility and a position that is not given to her by the word that is how the church in general has done they have rejected the word and they have taken their Creed dogmas and touch mans and things but the ran Church refused Christ to have any more Desire with her and let me say this you're going to call me something anyhow so is it today every one of them they fail to make that word take that word they refuse Christ when they refuse that word they refuse who the Bible is not up for debate this Bible is not up for ED this Bible is not up for revision it's a perfect word of God if it says something you don't like Drop what you had take what it say and any woman that refuses a man is child he has no right to be a wife to him I'm quoting remember you remember in the Bible when the King married Esther because the queen had refused he just got him another one what happened when she refused to come out with the King and Obey him the same thing it is with a woman that refuses to be wife to a husband and so is it today with the church that refuses to become pregnant in the age that we now live in words are deeper but I want you to understand them in the spiritual do I have spiritual Elders here all right a church should accept to be pred by the word meaning you accept the seed of the word of your day to bring forth children of this age let me bring it this way we have had many generations and many ages from Ephesus to you know pamos and all these Generations the church ages the bride is not only coming in our generation are you hearing me now she she's coming from the very first generations of the Apostles in every age that bride has to accept the word of that age but if she rejects it she refuses it she is refused by the how does that word come in a generation comes by the prophet of that age he's the chamberline that gives it to her we are not lutherans we are not Wiz neither are we Pentecostal we've got to be the children of this age the are supposed to make you feel good I hope you understand we couldn't be pregnant no so what did he do he put her away in divorcement but she Dar not put him away she put her away there is no church which can divorce Christ they cannot but Christ will divorce one by one and he will marry the one who submits to him only he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating him by himself his children begin to kind of look more like him because it is fully mature oh listen become children of the word not oh listen to this one now not children of the church Children of the word Children of the word and the bride oh I loveed this when I read it I shouted actually and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word hallelujah Glory Jesus is not going to marry a bad woman he's going to marry a young woman very beautiful what makes her because she believes every word Jus word bride not Touched By Any man's organization come on receive this by inspiration now not touched by any manade Theory she will be purely unadulterated Bride of the world we are the Bride of the world can I hear an aen from aie I hope you get that out there will be pregant a daughter of God I say praise the name of the Lord I am pregant tonight pregant with the word this stomach this womb cannot be Abed brother it cannot be Abed by the world it cannot be Abed by denomination by reason some people like reasoning me I just believe the word I am PR by the SE word of God as you are hearing now you are receiving the same s the spoken word is the original s hallelujah amen es said she did not want anything else by the king once the bride has been redeemed she is interested in nothing else but the word she is a manifestation of his character on Earth hallelujah hallelujah and I have a quot here in 1961 but the spirit that was in him he sent back down to the church so the church when this Covenant is brought into its full strength amen the Covenant of Abraham when the Covenant is confirmed with God the church the people that goes into this body here is to be his bride they will be exactly the same Spirit interpret it correctly Me singer let me read it again there will be exactly the same spirit that was upon Christ doing the same thing the same Ministry the same power and it will come together and be word by word the same fing the Covenant are you hearing me church that's how the church is going to be not the pastor the church Healing The Sick like Jesus healed the sick raising the day like Jesus ra the are you hearing Church cleansing the leapers like Jesus we everybody say me I have power say it come on to change the world did you do you know what I just say you have power to change the world not just one person but the whole world you have that power let me ask you a question did Jesus have power to change the world so do you because the Same Spirit dwells in you doing the same Ministry now listen identified Masterpiece of God he says so you see he has cut he wants to cut the church out just like he did the son out like he did the bride and the bridegroom to be his bride you must be a part of him not a part of the cre not a part of the church are happy if you're a part of us here you a part of the church but let me tell you when we do evangelism we don't evangelize for people to become a part of our church the denominations do that and then they begin boasting now we have 2,000 members 10,000 why because they see the people no we are evangelizing for people to become a part of the world if we wanted 20,000 people in one year it is possible but it is it depends on the way you Evangel and also the way you preach you can't preach the way we preach and get those masses in the speed at which they get can I talk to you as a pastor it is impossible why because look at the ministry of Jesus he had them by great thousands and they were all in his church and what happened he began preaching deep things you have to drink me and eat me they said ah they all walked out and Jesus was where would I get the money he didn't need the people to preach the gospel that's why when it's time for giving we have a project give it is for your good if you don't give it's up to you but the program of God will continue here we don't beg and fast for money no right Church begs and FES for money and spends more time talking about money and offerings more than time the word listen God doesn't need your money to run his kingdom no God do enough power did he need money to multiply the fish he need Mone to multiply the bread he didn't need those people to do that does things for the people God will do Miracles and wonders not for himself for you so whatever we do whether it is giving whether it is praying whe is dressing properly we are doing it for the glory of God for us so that the world can know that our God is God so we don't evangelize people into our church we evangelize them into the body of Christ yes I know we have fellowship and church and all that but I'm saying it is more than that not part of the denomination but the part of him that's why when we baptize we don't give baptism certificate because we are not baptizing you into our church I know I know some denominations they even make you say from today I'm a member of Adventist Church we don't want you to sign anywh do we have a book here that is for members no members fellow hallelujah amen but let me tell you you need after baptism to be filled with the Holy Ghost when you filled with the Holy Ghost then that is the certificate that you a member of the body of Christ hallelujah hallelujah we are by one Spirit are we all baptized so we are held we are cut out of any other kind of a form you've got to be held from the word the world cut off of you and you just leave the word only leave in you praise the name of the Lord now before I finish I want to talk a little bit about the first and the second Eve and um I want your full attention on this 1 Corinthians chapter 15 45 and so it is written the first Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how bit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth a the second man is the Lord From Heaven did you read that do you have that yes [Music] now in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed how many love more of the word t amen now the complete the complete fullness of the godhead bods in the church in his church the pinenes all that God he powered into Christ all Christ words powered into the church the Believers not denomination we will get that in a few minutes what is his purpose now to now listen church I'm not going to just finish I want you to get the point of this summon today what is his purpose now is to express himself as a son and now that in him might dwell the fullness of the godhead Bly that all through the scripture that's what God's purpose [Music] was to express himself then through the through this life of this son his cross the blood it says here of his cross that he might reconcile himself a body aght he died so he can get a bright which is who the second Eve you and God give it in a type as he did Moses and all of them the same thing he did in Adam and Eve giving a type that they were Christ and the bride he is the second Adam the church is the second Eve and as long as the second Eve compromises against the word now here's the question isn't she doing the same thing the first Eve did tell your neighbor I will not compromise praise the name of the Lord and God has hid this word from the wise and PR decided to reveal to the babies hello babies Jesus Christ such as would Le no reasoning I believe the word that's all praise the name of the Lord we are not going to compromise on the word let me tell you what it does to compromise on the word and then you say God will have mercy on me will have and you and you do what you do what you know you're not supposed to do here is what it does in the message time he says the serpent seed was produced by the first Eve by her getting away from the world when the first Eve left the word It produced what what was the name of that serpent seed because she compromised and what has she got now she's got a bunch of denomination of children morally good but what about it they dead through their Creeds Creeds anything which is not in the Bible is a Creed which is not here that's why we Bible Believers and we are alive through Christ we are not dead we are alive and that's why we should not be compromisers of the word hallelujah and the first Eve failed this second Eve she cannot fail oh my she's not touched by denomination no nothing and I want to show you here about this bride John 15 says and I love this verse when I read it it says just just read it after me it says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever he shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you I loved that I thought about Esther and I said he that's why Esther could not be denied because she did not choose herself the king chose her and you know what the choice this Choice meant one thing that the king cannot deny her the king knew very well what he was looking for and because the king knew what he was looking for he knew eser will bring it forth let me tell you what the King was looking for the King was looking for his character in a woman so now when he saw eser he knew you are the one and he chose her so Esther had no choice to bring forth the character of The King and that's why here he says you have not chosen me God now speaks to our church as me this is now I read it for me you have not chosen me but I have chosen you ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit brother Andre whether you like it or not if he chose you you are going to bring the whatever God Envision did he choose you you must bring the FR if you am a fornicator he chose you who who believes that God chose you if God chose you you are joking fruits must come forth not because you will struggle he has said he chose you to bring Force I don't know how many have understood that Ephesians 1:4 says he has chosen us did he choose us by the way he says in him Hallelujah first thr I went I'm tired that's is an excuse leave it and listen what I'm saying I'm about to finish you know I'm not a very long preacher I preach long if I feel is necessary so usually I would finish by now but give me more minutes through that now listen you two give me 20 more minutes don't switch praise the name of the Lord what does he say here this is the disadvantage of a pastor being a short preacher people get used to [Music] Hallelujah when I was in Ethiopia I used to have a sister called yod I love that lady she used to fire up the whole CH even if she sits behind she will be a firecracker I want I want someone like that sister preferably Hallelujah it's a Ministry oh my all right let's go back to this and see how we can so he says when did he choose us he says he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame him in love his choice of us oh no no no let me bring it down his choice of me me meant that I must bring forth fruit his choice in in his choice of me he chose me not just now when I accepted not on the day of my baptism not on the day I said I am done with sin but it chose me before the foundation of the world before listen before there was any sin before there was any wrongdoing before there was anything he saw me and chose me and therefore I am here let me declare now I am here Amen to do what to bring forth to reflect his unfailing character [Applause] I must reflect his power and His glory there is no he's not going to send angels to reflect his power and Glory he's going to send us you the one he chose before the found amen I am here oh someone tell the devil I have arrived I am here I was born I am here and because I'm here sat be careful be careful because I am here to reflect his power his glory everything God is everything he represents I am here to reflect it the devil can't stop that he has hindered many has killed many but when Jesus came what was he he was the Lamb of God why he came to reconcile a body for himself to bring forth his bride to bring back his dead Church his dead wife so that the the Lord can be able to tell sat behold the Lamb's wife meaning Hallelujah you killed all the others but you could not even you killed me even you killed me on the cross but you cannot kill this one it was for her that I di for her I suffer she cannot die twice that's why the Bible says we live in Christ through Christ we live we are dead to to sin and we are alive through Christ why because we are the Lamb's wife and when we come in the world we come to reflect his glory don't worry your life May look like the glory of God is Not Seen but the glory is coming glory is coming we should begin believing in Miracles these Miracles will be different from those of the House of the these ones will come from the knowledge of Christ from the relationship with Christ don't joke with a gift that comes out of loveah when you give a gift to your wife even if it's just a flower but because she knows you love her she will cherish it and use it for the glory of God in the same way God is going to raise gifts Among Us Supernatural gifts we should believe in those things things which will show the power of God Miracles will happen in such ways and magnitude that no one can be able to you know def no one can even you know go back and say let me do it again talking about things that God will do through his bride I don't know how many but I I am looking for those that are getting ready to say I am the Lamb's wife I want him to reflect his character through my life hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah and I'll finish with this message the choosing of a bride I could not have finished without reading this quotes again the kind of a woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition his character understanding man can they choose a woman who will not give birth to Children is it possible answer Meen it is impossible even Christ is wi if he's choosing a wife a wife he chooses a wife that will bear fruit he wants fruits what are his fruits it is to show for his his glory the life life is here to manifest the glory of God let me tell you even if you have a business and it is as if it is going to don't just give up say it is up to you he doesn't want that whatever he has given you remember what you are don't look at what you have look at what you are you are a bride of Christ now if the business is declining or the job is getting over and you get to wor you don't know what you are Jesus is looking for wives like Esther what they went to kill us it is impossible pray and fast and meet the king Hallelujah he said I will meet the king we are not going to just die going to just die my sister I'm not going to die like this my business is not going to perish like this it is impossible because I am the bride of Christ hallelujah hallelujah he chose us to reflect his character even a man when he chooses a woman he will reflect his character if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to it shows truly what is in him the brothers can you shout amen a woman reflects what is in the man when he chooses for it shows what is done in him no matter what he says outside watch what he now I've given you the clue from today don't believe any man until you watch what he has when you see his wife if you want to know me look at my wife no she's a different type of person she is me I looked at all women in the world and I said she's the best that can reflect who I am when I see her I see myself she's a reflection of my character I am I choose her in the same way today if you want to know a man see know him by the woman he has married that's why fear a younger man who goes around sleeping with nonbelievers he is a nonbeliever that's the truth watch what a man married I go to a man's office and he says he's a Christian around the world and a buy WGY music going on you know some of you want to listen to that kind of music you are rotten you need a savior because those things you're feeding on are rotten you eating on it I don't care what he saying I don't believe his testimony because his spirit feeding on on those things of the world those kind of things of the world music that's what works for you young man when you begin listen to eat now begin to feel different you even want to pull down your because it's a feing on you you begin to put on those and then you begin walking in a because you're feeding on those things so it is now leading you the character of that SP in you even you begin to tune your hair in that mean you mean even connected to the music is the spirit you're feeding on and that Spirit has character it has a nature just like the spirit of Christ has character it has a nature so when you feed on it it molds you you know we dance here many times but watch The Way We Dance is a spiritual danceing but you go in the dance hall actually me I can listen to loud music if only it is woring my head can't take Wordly loud music I can pass out I just feel a lot of but when it is worshiping God it's good Christian music I feel so good sometimes I drive and I put on a music and I want to increase easy so it can blow me up as long as it is worshiping my God I feel so good and one time I was in the car driving and listening to this and I was singing along I don't remember the St I was enjoying it and I did not know sometimes it goes through so when we were in traffic there this man on the side looked at me and he had his mou he couldn't believe that someone could be crazy with the music that worships God but brother younger brother and younger sister be crazy with that kind of music Let it feed your soul so the woman you choose you young man shows your character all right what you say if you would marry a chorus girl or if he would marry a sex queen or just a pretty mod recor it reflects it shows what he has in his mind what his future home is going to be because he has taken this woman to raise his children by and whatever my good Lord whatever she is that's the way she will raise those children I wish I had a bigger voice whatever she is the way she dresses the way she talks the way she behaves the way she treats around with is the way she would raise those children don't expect don't marry a sex Queen children I remember many time many years ago in M we used to have a neighbor and this neighbor was a drunen I think she was these expensive prostitutes you know so she somehow got a baby out of that and so she would keep going back to the club every night but you see she used to go with that child so sad I used to be young but I would still feel sad about it and this child learned how to drink at a very and she was also a girl like her mother so you would find them at home in the morning a child of three years and a mother both having hung they were in the club at night and you find them dancing with all the girl knows how to pull the woman you marry the way she is is the way she will raise your children so when you Maring brother don't think about yourself think about your children you are not marrying for you you are marrying for your next generation and that's why I remember when we see these churches and we call them Churches of Christ you see the Church of Christ by the character of Christ in that church how they dress how they behave how they dance they do their music even our music is different praise the name of the Lord so it reflects what is in the man a man takes a woman like that it shows just what is thinking of the future 90% of young people to get married they think about beauty how your children care about beauty that my mother is beautiful well they won't care about it so much if they they also in the world and and you know these days with makeup there is no ugly woman there a man who married a woman recently later on he took her to court and the reason was that he was fed you know why because they got had a wonderful wedding always seeing her but never seeing her in the morning so when they reached at home this time around after theed the woman removed the eyelids she removed the eyebrows she removed the mouth she removed the ears she removed the makeup and before you know it when the guy woke up in the morning and the wig she removed the wig also this is a true story when the man woke up what is it my daddy who is your daddy who are you and went to went to court filing for divorce this is not the woman I when he saw said what she but thank God that in this message we don't have sisters who fake right we believe in sisters who are original be natural and brother don't look for beauty if you look for a bey Queen you will find her but you regret find that area of character does you have the character that you want the character of Christ the character of the world can could you imagine a Christian doing a thing like that no sir I could not a true Christian will not look for such b Queens accus girl Queens he will look for Christian character you know the way she dress how does she look let me tell you now the sad news to you younger people it doesn't matter who you marry they are going to change I'm speaking about the physical appearance that is going to change some of you have showed you the picture of my wife I don't know if you've not I wish I had given it Mom you remember how she she was who is small here I'm seeing all of you are big she was really tiny all of them are big I was even going to call her daughter but even as she's big she would be nice and small and slender that's the truth I'm not I'm not trying to Hype it it's the truth it's the reality I'm being a pastor this morning telling reality and I did not no one told me she change we had the first child second child third child fourth and before I knew it before he knew it she had added on weight she had and there some women who say I won't even bre why they don't want their breasts to sag they they don't want their body to change they don't want to push child or whatever they want even to at seven eight months so they can go back again let me tell you it's a spirited of the age and when you're marrying don't look at physical appearance whether she's big or small she will change hello brother sh that's the truth brother Andrew I'm not joking it's the truth is hiding himself she would change it's the truth so if you're marrying a woman this one is slender look at her nails everything is going to change look for character the other time I was talking with my wife she told me I should not bring it on the PO now I've just said it already I'll just say a little bit you know I was telling her that's the problem with pastors you know she was wondering whether I still love her the way I did and I I I said I have to I have to be truthful to you let me say the truth because you see let me tell you the truth when you marry and get children things begin changing people have come in between and so she's busy with them time you used to give me begins reducing the time he used to give you begins reducing and many times in marriage you might feel like maybe Love Has Changed not it has changed it has become more busy now sometimes I would want to take out my wife for ice cream one day we wanted to escape from home because and then when one child had everything was daddy mommy you are going without I said now we are not so we we could not do anything but to go with everyone it was not fun for me and her it was not fun as it used to be you see that's why it is good you you marry get children quickly take it out of the way and begin enjoying life together I've heard people who say oh you are supporting people to marry young I believe in marrying Young it is when you a sister don't wait to get the PHD and Mar when a brother comes don't keep when you become 35 the truth you become difficult you have to pray a lot of prayers and fast a lot of fasting and we shall join you but it is more difficult no I'm telling you the truth you young ladies find husbands on your knees and believe for them when you are young 20 to 25 that is the age of you a woman getting married but when when you become 2021 you them this one has a big nose this one is looking bad this one has no money and then when you become 30 I wish the other brother the and then he can't come back he has already moved on with another sister and then now at 38 you come to the pastor Pastor I want to marry say I'm going to pray with you what is your need who who do you want exactly Pastor no problem anything that comes my way I will take as long as he a Son of God they even about to say even if he's not a very serious believer sister don't wait for that time be more serious to desire a man at the right age praise the name of the Lord I have to finish somewhere here now I have to finish somewhere here and see Friends character is what you should be looking for could you imagine a man you know look doing something like that but you see the story I was giving you just to not leave it hanging and so I was telling my wife that dear I have to be honest with you I I used to love you very much but at that time when we were starting out I have something to confess she said what is it I used to think I told her that even if maybe not to say that I wanted you to die but even if God would have taken you I would do I used look at it as an opportunity I will have now more you're Now Quiet that's the truth are used to see brother bam had a wife and the wife died and I was so foolish in my thoughts at that time say ah he was blessed he had more than one I used to think it's a blessing and I was wondering was crying and you know saying oh God I will never marry again I said what's wrong with brother bham it's a blessing take it you know and so I told my wife brother inter you better interpret don't think about what I'm saying so I told my wife that the truth is I I I used to think about it that way the Bible says be happy with those who are happy maybe you can laugh for a little bit but now I told her I used to be so foolish I I told I'll tell you this now right now I don't know whether she noticed it but when I said this I felt even tears I told her but now I became emotional when I was saying that I said I can't even think about life without this is a woman that prays for me a woman that takes care of the children prays with the children reads the Bible for them teaches them the ways of teach them how to be real women for me when I go on Mission I mean when I come back home I get food find hous ready andren can you imagine life without imagine life without so at first my priorities were different but after spending 12 years with I'm realizing she is me life has grown Deeper Life has G more serious it's no longer about no it's no longer it is that and much more it's that much more it is much more than that it is more than physical appearance it is it is more than how will my children look like physically it is it is much more I don't know how I can explain it's like we've become one life without her is impossible and that is what happens when you marry in Christ when you marry character and not Beauty when you Mar character and not a sex queen or whatever it is you see and the prophet says you can't have all things have old things there might be one girl that's really pretty and the other girl maybe she's a St looks like better than this one and you might have to sacrifice one for the other but if she's not the St of a lady a woman I don't care whether she's pretty or not you better look at her character whether she's pretty or not Brethren there is more I can say but I don't want this to be a three hour long summer but I want to finish saying this Christ Jesus wants to marry a church a bride and is called her the Lamb's wife he wants to look at her and say she's life of my life character of my nature of my nature she's my wife not someone you're always fighting let me tell you when you marry someone Tri won't even mean a lot [Music] after won't mean much it won't how much education she has what will it will come down to one thing real mother someone who can take care of your children someone who will love you for who you are someone who you will love for who she is and that's the way it is with Christ it has come down to one thing he's saying you are my wife because your character is like my character you are life of my life character of my character nature of my nature you are my bride that's what Christ looks at not how we look but who we are and that's why he molds Us in his character when we come to him and he wants to be able to say at the end of it all behold the Lamb's wife we may stand on our feet let us pray our heavenly father there are many things that have been said today perhaps a little longer sermon than usual but these are things that have been on my heart and I've been able to say as much as you allowed me to say I believe it as accomplish the purpose for which you purposed these are your
