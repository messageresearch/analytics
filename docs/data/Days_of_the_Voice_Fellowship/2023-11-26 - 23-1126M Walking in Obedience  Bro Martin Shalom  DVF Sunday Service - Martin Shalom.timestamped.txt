[1:14:34] walking in
[1:14:40] obedience
[1:14:41] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:14:45] Lord and where we have
[1:14:48] read we are seeing uh the prophet of God
[1:14:52] saying something to the king
[1:14:57] you know uh
[1:14:59] God wants us to obey his
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:11] word blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:15:15] he expect us to walk in
[1:15:19] obedience and there are some things that
[1:15:21] we are going to see alongside the way
[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:27] blessed be the name of the Lord because
[1:15:30] even Jesus said that if you love me you
[1:15:35] will keep my
[1:15:36] commandment so if you read with me uh 1
[1:15:40] Samuel chapter 15 We Begin from verses
[1:15:45] two it says that thus says the Lord of
[1:15:48] host I remember that which americ did to
[1:15:52] Israel how he laid wait for
[1:15:55] him in the way when he came up from
[1:16:03] [Music]
[1:16:13] Egypt and now go and Smit Amit and
[1:16:16] utterly destroy all that they have and
[1:16:20] spare them not
[1:16:29] but SL both man and woman infant and
[1:16:32] cing ox and sheep camel and
[1:16:45] ass
[1:16:47] amen destroy
[1:16:50] everything here God was giving
[1:16:53] instruction
[1:16:56] blessed be the name of the Lord and they
[1:16:59] were entitled to obey what God was
[1:17:01] telling
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:04] them God had a reason why he was saying
[1:17:09] so blessed be the name of the
[1:17:13] Lord and when God gives us
[1:17:17] directive it is not a
[1:17:21] parable it is always Direct
[1:17:25] it God gives it with
[1:17:28] Revelation blessed be the name of the
[1:17:31] Lord amen God's law is
[1:17:37] direct it is not a
[1:17:40] parable when he says that the wge of sin
[1:17:43] is death he means
[1:17:47] that that if we sin we shall surely
[1:17:53] die praise the the Lord when God spoke
[1:17:56] in uh in Genesis Genesis
[1:18:03] 3 and when God gave instruction to Adam
[1:18:06] and
[1:18:08] Eve that was
[1:18:11] Final and as long as they obeyed what
[1:18:14] God told them to
[1:18:18] do they were
[1:18:20] okay and brother in the message talken
[1:18:23] he says
[1:18:25] that full obedience to the whole word of
[1:18:30] God will entitle you to the
[1:18:36] Token full
[1:18:39] obedience to the word of
[1:18:43] God us to the
[1:18:47] Token to the Holy
[1:18:50] Ghost amen if you obey God fully
[1:18:57] we will have the Holy
[1:18:59] Spirit he will give us the Holy Ghost
[1:19:02] that's says the
[1:19:04] messenger and why are we not seeing the
[1:19:07] outpouring of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:19:11] mid why are we not seeing it in
[1:19:14] Christian
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:18] fraternity amen it is there but if you
[1:19:22] read this quote
[1:19:25] it shows that if we obey God
[1:19:30] fully all of us we are entitle to the
[1:19:36] Token blessed be the name of the Lord if
[1:19:40] we walk in full obedience to the word of
[1:19:44] God the victory is on our
[1:19:48] side blessed be the name of the
[1:19:51] Lord amen
[1:19:55] praise the
[1:19:57] lord we shall go
[1:20:00] slow and when God requires anything it
[1:20:04] must be
[1:20:08] accomplished there is no way of dodging
[1:20:13] that there is no shortcut for
[1:20:16] that when God requires us to
[1:20:21] repent for us to gain another level
[1:20:26] for us to get
[1:20:28] somewhere we must
[1:20:31] repent there is no any other
[1:20:36] shortcut blessed be the name of the
[1:20:39] Lord amen and here when he gave his
[1:20:45] instruction and we are seeing King so
[1:20:47] went the
[1:20:49] battle in this very
[1:20:52] chapter God's instruction was very very
[1:20:56] clear it was
[1:20:59] direct it was
[1:21:02] straight it was in the
[1:21:05] light blessed be the name of the Lord it
[1:21:08] was not even in
[1:21:11] symbols praise be to
[1:21:14] God
[1:21:15] Amen when God gives us his
[1:21:21] word it is not a GU work
[1:21:25] is not
[1:21:27] gambling God's word is always
[1:21:31] direct and he want us to obey his
[1:21:36] word blessed be the name of the
[1:21:39] Lord and here where we have
[1:21:43] read where
[1:21:45] brother started from you see that
[1:21:51] Samuel he said that Lord
[1:21:56] as uh as as the Lord as great Delight in
[1:21:59] burnt offering and
[1:22:01] sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the
[1:22:15] Lord that is a
[1:22:17] question that we may offer our
[1:22:21] sacrifice we may worship
[1:22:25] we may shout we may pray in Tong Tong of
[1:22:29] men and
[1:22:32] angels but the question still comes
[1:22:35] back are we obedient to the word of
[1:22:39] God not obeying
[1:22:42] some God word supposed to be obeyed
[1:22:48] fully
[1:22:49] amen God does not expect us to obey his
[1:22:52] word infraction
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:22:58] butey the
[1:23:01] whole blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:23:04] and when we obey the word of God
[1:23:08] fully that's when we have
[1:23:11] Victory and we are going to see here
[1:23:14] that
[1:23:15] somewhere when when sa went the
[1:23:19] battle so fought the
[1:23:22] Battle he did according to what God had
[1:23:25] told
[1:23:27] him
[1:23:29] amen but
[1:23:31] somewhere he reached somewhere and he
[1:23:37] compromised but remember so was not
[1:23:40] God's choice to begin
[1:23:45] with you agree with me blessed be the
[1:23:49] name of the Lord because you remember in
[1:23:52] Samuel when Israel demanded for the
[1:23:56] king they wanted to be like other
[1:23:59] nations who are the king who was leading
[1:24:03] them and that displeased
[1:24:07] God blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:24:11] God gave them their
[1:24:15] desire blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:24:18] and they show sa to lead
[1:24:22] them because he was great in
[1:24:25] Tre maybe was
[1:24:28] giant maybe had six
[1:24:31] PS it was maybe well
[1:24:34] trained and for them according to their
[1:24:38] see their
[1:24:40] perspective they saw that that man would
[1:24:43] make a great
[1:24:46] king but remember God was God was the
[1:24:49] king of
[1:24:52] Israel he was the champion of the
[1:24:55] champion he was the great
[1:24:59] warrior amen when God LED them in their
[1:25:04] battles they never lost any
[1:25:09] battle somewhere in the world the Bible
[1:25:12] says gave them Victory which they did
[1:25:15] not even fight
[1:25:17] for he gave them cities which they never
[1:25:22] build amen
[1:25:24] he gave them V which they never
[1:25:27] [Applause]
[1:25:29] planted that was their
[1:25:34] King blessed be the name
[1:25:37] of oh how important it is to be led by
[1:25:42] God this reach
[1:25:45] somewhere they they
[1:25:48] compromised they admired other kings
[1:25:54] when they looked at them the way the
[1:25:55] Kings used to
[1:25:59] dress huge
[1:26:01] element putting on arm
[1:26:07] breasts having huge
[1:26:11] Spears and we also need to have
[1:26:14] one and God was not
[1:26:17] pleased Samuel was not
[1:26:20] pleased because he spoke for God
[1:26:25] amen that troubled him so
[1:26:30] much and asked
[1:26:33] them for all the time they have been
[1:26:37] together what he has not
[1:26:40] done blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:26:43] God told
[1:26:45] samel give them the
[1:26:49] king praise be to
[1:26:52] God and they shall Sal be there
[1:26:56] king that's why when God chooses you
[1:26:59] that is something different from when
[1:27:01] men
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:07] chooses many time when someone is just
[1:27:12] chosen Maybe by uh by the
[1:27:15] church or by
[1:27:18] organization by
[1:27:21] group there is a time when he will feel
[1:27:23] like
[1:27:26] [Music]
[1:27:32] amen but when God chooses you no matter

[1:58:59] there we have bought something
[1:59:03] else it is understandable for the sister
[1:59:08] to

[1:59:18] delayed sa sa is this
[1:59:30] they were not streaming their
[1:59:34] services if they were streaming their
[1:59:39] services came
[1:59:42] streaming maybe she wouldn't even have
[1:59:44] come to
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:50] church chur
[1:59:54] the government did not sue
[1:59:56] them for killing a
[2:00:02] person but even if you're the head of
[2:00:04] would you attack such
[2:00:08] people a man has lied and they fall
[2:00:12] dead and they said
[2:00:22] that fear of God fell
[2:00:25] upon and people feared to join them the
[2:00:32] say God added unto them
[2:00:35] daily amen
[2:00:40] am it was not
[2:00:44] pulling put on
[2:00:46] naked and you will make those Brothers
[2:00:50] come put on
[2:00:54] and you
[2:00:56] willp
[2:00:59] ameny the word
[2:01:03] fully blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:01:06] then the man of God
[2:01:10] ask what am I hearing
[2:01:15] bleeding in my
[2:01:19] ears the lowing of the oxygen which I
[2:01:21] hear
[2:01:30] also crying the America
[2:01:33] way because Soul had brought them amen
[2:01:38] amen and Saul said what me then this
[2:01:44] that's Samuel and Saul said they have
[2:01:48] brought them from the Amit
[2:01:52] for the people spared the Beast of the
[2:02:00] sheep he was saying people
[2:02:04] sped who has given the
[2:02:08] Commandment when a commandment is given
[2:02:12] out there should be somebody to speak it
[2:02:16] out and then there must be followers
[2:02:19] amen amen
[2:02:33] now you can't say
[2:02:36] anything now the man
[2:02:38] was that people
[2:02:40] told that these sheep will work they
[2:02:43] will work for
[2:02:45] us maybe they were even special
[2:02:49] Fran hybrid hybrid
[2:02:53] bless the name of the
[2:02:55] Lord and they really they were
[2:02:59] good and he
[2:03:02] brought for the people Spar them the
[2:03:06] best of the sheep and of The Oxen to
[2:03:08] sacrifice unto the Lord
[2:03:22] it even shows me that Samuel's God was
[2:03:26] different for you would have said our
[2:03:30] God but he was
[2:03:32] right because Samuel's
[2:03:35] God told him to destroy
[2:03:38] all but the other Go's God told
[2:03:43] him he was speaking as if he was and the
[2:03:46] rest we have utterly
[2:03:48] destroyed brother sister it's not about
[2:03:52] what you have
[2:03:53] destroyed it is all about what you have
[2:03:57] spared the Commandment was Destroy
[2:04:02] Everything amen they
[2:04:06] destroyed and SP some and when he came
[2:04:10] before God before the prophet of God is
[2:04:14] saying we have destroyed
[2:04:17] others but this one we have spared
[2:04:23] we have destroyed the little
[2:04:25] children we have destroyed the
[2:04:28] mothers we have spared the
[2:04:31] king some oxen some
[2:04:35] ass
[2:04:37] amen blessed be the name of the
[2:04:45] Lord then Saul
[2:04:49] said uh uh then Saul said
[2:04:52] uh said unto Saul Samuel said unto Saul
[2:04:55] stay stay and I will tell thee what the
[2:04:59] Lord said to me this
[2:05:09] night and he said unto
[2:05:16] him in the night conference
[2:05:20] [Music]
[2:05:21] remember Samuel when he had this
[2:05:24] things his soul was
[2:05:27] troubled he knew that problem had come
[2:05:30] in
[2:05:31] Israel and he went before the Lord to
[2:05:35] intercede to plead the whole
[2:05:37] night amen something
[2:05:41] happened when he was interceding the
[2:05:44] Lord spoke to him and gave him
[2:05:49] Direction and when he came to me S
[2:05:54] maybe if he
[2:05:56] came before asking inquiring from
[2:06:02] God maybe they would have fought each
[2:06:04] other he went to
[2:06:07] seek he went to seek the perfect will of
[2:06:11] God God what are you saying about
[2:06:15] this we have
[2:06:17] strayed he knew they in problem
[2:06:21] say message then Jesus come and that
[2:06:25] when Jesus leaves our
[2:06:27] home Trouble Is On The
[2:06:30] Way amen that's why Jesus has to be in
[2:06:35] our
[2:06:39] hom so the king said St
[2:06:43] on and someone said when thou was a
[2:06:47] little in thine own sight
[2:06:52] was thou not made the head of the tribe
[2:06:55] of
[2:06:56] Israel and the Lord anointed thee over
[2:07:01] Israel and the Lord sent thee on the
[2:07:04] journey and said go and utterly destroy
[2:07:08] is again reminding him of the
[2:07:12] [Music]
[2:07:15] word amen he was supposed to obey every
[2:07:20] word
[2:07:25] destroy the Sinners
[2:07:30] the and fight against them until they be
[2:07:37] consumed wherefore then did thou not
[2:07:40] obey the voice of the
[2:07:44] Lord liely upon the
[2:07:47] spoil and is evil in the sight of the
[2:07:50] Lord
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:53] said
[2:07:55] Samuel I have obeyed the voice of the
[2:07:58] Lord I have gone the way which the Lord
[2:08:01] sent me and I brought God the king of
[2:08:05] am
[2:08:14] androy ladies and
[2:08:16] gentleman to be a
[2:08:19] sinner is so bad
[2:08:23] that even when God is speaking to our
[2:08:27] hearts we are
[2:08:32] reasoning God is speaking
[2:08:35] to but he's
[2:08:39] blinded it's not all about
[2:08:44] obeying we must obey
[2:08:47] fully we must take every word
[2:08:52] we must live by every
[2:08:53] word may God give us the
[2:08:57] grace amen this man was
[2:09:01] convinced that
[2:09:07] because but the thing was
[2:09:11] clear is always
[2:09:15] clear

[2:09:21] word of
[2:09:23] God God will confront

[2:09:36] man when you are disobeying the
[2:09:42] word we are pulling his through by
[2:09:49] Disobedience amen
[2:09:54] this man insisted
[2:09:57] seriously but the people took of the
[2:09:59] spoil and sheep and oxygen and sheep of
[2:10:01] the of the things which should have been
[2:10:03] utterly destroyed to sacrifice and the
[2:10:05] Lord thy God in gilar and samel said has
[2:10:08] the Lord has a great daylight in burnt
[2:10:11] offering and sacrifice
[2:10:21] in obeying the voice of the Lord behold
[2:10:25] to obey is better than sacrifice and to
[2:10:28] Heen than the fat of
[2:10:42] RS you go you win
[2:10:45] milon you come

[2:11:44] Choice amen that's why he was pleasing
[2:11:47] the
[2:11:49] people but the Bible says the word of
[2:11:53] God comes to the
[2:11:55] prophet and the prophet is correcting
[2:11:59] him and man is still

[2:26:55] circumcised according to the promise
[2:26:57] which God gave to
[2:26:58] ABRA every man child born in Israel was
[2:27:01] supposed to be
[2:27:03] circumcised and this man was busy in the
[2:27:07] service he forgot about his own
[2:27:10] service and the Bible says God wanted to
[2:27:14] kill
[2:27:17] Moses the word of God Came Upon
[2:27:23] Andi was spiritual
[2:27:27] enough to save the

[2:28:48] disobedient are people that have not yet
[2:28:51] been adopted and
