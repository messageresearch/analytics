us a successful trip and we we visited three different locations in karamoja tournament we visited of course we were sleeping in Morocco but from morato we would go to cotido network um then we went to um we went to Matan also we have two Services there and also we went to a new place I had not gone to this place before it's called a longer road and in that place it's uh because the other I mean we will just go through bushes to go there the road is really not good uh told us that we are going on I think it was on Thursday side on Thursday we are going to a bush I was now surprised I mean we thought we had gone to a bush so which other Bush are we going to now if this is not a bush it was uh amazing so we went in a road it was not tamakt of course and then we reached in a place where we left that road and we now went on a cow path networks and we went into a goat pack it went narrowing and [Applause] um uh it was a wonderful time we had about three or four people who gave their love their hearts to Jesus and brother Michael preached two Services there also Services you know we hit something I don't know of course there was no Road and the shock absorber you know pressed itself and we did not know but by the time we're coming out we were just smelling you know rubber together and by the time we reached on tarmac together let me go and check what is happening I found that the shock absorber was pressing itself against the tires and part of the tire was eaten away so if we had continued driving the tire would busted and that would be an accident so we did not know whether we're going to find anywhere to fix it but long story short I want to say God carried us On Eagle's Wings and we were able to find someone to fix it at least for the moment and we found ourselves amen me now it was a really marathon on Monday morning I could not drive it was still dark so I wanted to drive we had Isaac but I didn't want him to drive in the darkness but I drove until my eyes were also going the whole time the lord gave us Grace and the mission was 100 successful perhaps about a thousand five hundred to two thousand people wherever we went towards in Canada foreign [Music] they

talk a little bit about anchor and anchor how many of us knows what an anchor is praise the Lord amen I was looking for the meaning for the explanation of an Anchorage and according to what I found there the first one is that is a heavy object attached to a attached or kept to a cable or chain s amen mean to hold a ship to the Sea bottom Shiva actually immediately amen typically are having a metallic crank [Music] with a pair of carve dicama Kona amen Nina another one says that an anchor is a person or a thing that provides stability or confidence in other words amen Mina in uncertain situation an anchor a nanga is used by uh those who sail like in the seas like they mean like when they reach somewhere in the middle of the sea if they want to have a little rest or some time when when they are touched by the waves they cast that anchor it has a long shame [Music] which is very strong and it's very long it will go deep deep deep and to the Sea through the whole maybe on a rock I give that ship stability blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord but I thank God this morning that even Christian we have an it says here that uh it's what provide you stability and the confidence in a changing frantic and certain world it is a thing that keeps you grounded [Music] and it keeps you alive from capitalizing um blessed with the name of the Lord I believe that we are living in the time of the coming of the lord we are living in the time where there is a lot of perplex of time we are living in perilous times we are seeing many things happening around us we are seeing the great Falling Away amen people are being drifted away from the message others have gone back to the world others have been moved because of money [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] must be [Applause] is nothing other than the Holy Ghost amen from the beginning of the day the Bible says the kingdom of God suffered violence they take it by force the Holy Ghost has been preached Jesus preached about it yes he said that when he goes [Applause] no longer cannot be your church foreign brethren [Music] [Applause] [Applause] to enter into the holy into the holiest by the blood of Jesus that is he persevered he said let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise Hebrews chapter 10 verses 23. tonight amen [Applause] the one who promised his faithful and that's where our anchor holds our way we know Jesus is faithful yes sir wow the rest you're running into and be ready we are foreign [Music] amen I'm going to my father to prepare your place amen blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord Jesus went fast yes there is a reason as to why we must be anchored behind the face [Applause] don't stop outside don't come up with you don't be be satisfied with crying shouting is good crying in school there is something behind the face where the Mana is fresh every day a man with it yes sir that's where he was sold all to be anchored [Music] bless them in the name of the Lord sometimes we are bored when uh when maybe we are worshiping some it is because there is something missing in your life when you're throwing your life from Jesus Christ oh brother sister you will enjoy worship blessed be the name of the Lord I want to tell you my brothers that is the blood of Jesus sideways to praise the Lord man you must be under the blood or in a better one Messiah that's the only way you can attract God you need your anger to be you need to be anchored under the face that's where God wants you to be in this case we are living in we are living with evil [Music] we have gone worser than where Sodom was sodium in spools it is evil days you need Christ to save your soul you need to run for you alive you don't have Jesus how to uh and God give that God gave them instructions [Music] I remember the time of sacrifice and the prince had to sanctify himself before entering in there because if you enter there when you are unworthy that meant death blessed with the name of the Lord because when they are cutting the sins of the people nobody was supposed was supposed to go there but only the priests I believe it was such a hard thing it is today [Music] foreign one [Music] amen Amina and that's why the Bible tells us here to God now let us come with boldness [Music] amen you must be anchored behind the face [Music] you know when you're on the outer courts [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord in the outer Court here that's where there's a lot of shouting amen everybody can shout around them everybody can jump around blessed be the name of the Lord sometime remember so the lipstick and yeah sometimes even those with the lipstick and he said every single number is yes you know where Believers are in the Holy Place some small things it is because you are in a holy place that's where life is [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah a Christian the prophet says that a Christian is not toast about um you must know where you're standing there you must be sure you must know whom you believe you must be persuaded amen amen you are not coming here because we called you because Pastor invited but because inside your soul something longing for it is [Music] when this word is revealed to you you will not stagger Brothers it I'm Crystal yes yes sir wow there are many other anchors by the way others are angry denominations [Music] [Music] amen I mean others anger is in charge of Uganda Uganda but where is your uncle [Music] blessed in the name of the Lord others say that we believe the message [Music] the devil in flesh amen blessed with the name of the Lord don't put your ank on your husband [Music] your husband is a sinking son [Music] um don't put your hand on your job in anger amen Amina but let your uncle be in Christ Jesus Christ he was tested from the beginning amen amen is the devil's match for you yes yes sir we are there in the convention our death was the great challenge yes sir I mean why are we Anchored In Jesus there is no any other match yes sir I mean apart from Jesus Christ he has never fought a battle and lost one he has never fail in any way foreign [Music] amen amen is the great champion [Music] and it's our Anchorage I know the thoughts I have to adhere oh yes I mean what an assurance to bring you to unexpected ends sometimes you look at yourself [Applause] who are you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you must have something to challenge god with has best on it how many times do you receive such messages and instead of holding your ground you start whipping maybe one day they tell you that the things you do even you are Aunt used to say the name of the Lord amen amen and then you start worrying [Music] that disease even your auntie diabetes and she was even paralyzed every time you pray you see yourself paralyzed brother sister you'll be anchored behind the face you will drop that testimony you will tell them amen I'm not scared by that this is [Music] foreign darker [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord amen Amina let us have church this morning praise the Lord amen every time the world comes the Bible says like it was in the beginning of the spirit of God the surface of the Earth yes sir I mean and God spoke and what if God what is God doing this morning speaking to you it's up to America amen Amina and go with it blessed in the name of the Lord when the word of God the Holy Ghost moves around is looking for the right place amen but when the father speak you'll get it I've I think I've never seen a father speaking business I've never found a dad who speaks business to people who are slumbering praise the Lord in tutoring amen where the Holy Ghost bring back the reports they ask the father will ask the tutor how is on fire again and when he comes back we find when it's now himself is not flame he says praise the Lord then he says okay okay next time when you're coming I'm giving you a package foreign every time he moves around foreign Marina then he rushed back to the phone I told you I told you that is what happened to jokes what's behind the face praise be to God I mean amen he says the Lord Brother sister I believe that today is since we can't we just can't understand amen I mean maybe they were there in the backyard they're moving and their boss came and asked them what is not happening you know you had this statement after I've done all this is because remember when job was at home um the foreign you are not speaking and the man the man was said to it um you'll be saved foreign in other words the devil is double I his eyes are crossed um the person can look at this you may think he is watching this brother decide praise be to God so every time he sees the mistake the devil developed that and because of wanting to see mistakes the devil always wants to look everywhere that is why he sees the Lord but when you're anchored behind the face we thank God for the message we are sucking from him amen amen praise be together and if you are sagging from Christ behind the faith you must apply the token your mother's righteousness will not take you to heaven amen I mean one of these days you live and deny your very mother is all foreign amen I mean that's when you concern or tell your grandmother who is your friends you know that I'm older than you yeah Grandma before the world was crazy amen I mean and that's where the devil fight mostly but if we can know who we are now yes where we came from when Abram crossed this Revelation that was set on fire
