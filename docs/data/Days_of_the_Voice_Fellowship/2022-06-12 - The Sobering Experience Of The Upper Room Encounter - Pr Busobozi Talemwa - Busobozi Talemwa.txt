fishers of men and they straight away left their nets and followed him and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their

some of you say pasta is dreaming baby some of you are he will also do foreign sure that what i was waiting upon was for you and this morning i'm speaking on a subject the suffering experience of the upper room encounter there's a word you missed there suffering okay it is the experience that sobers you you know becomes we understand it from somebody who somebody who is not sober is drunk someone who is not so bad cannot does not have clear vision here [Music] encounters [Music] god bless you now you have it i mean how many understand what i'm talking about hallelujah and so this morning entirely i'm asking that you give me your undivided attention and if you do that uh i will not take longer that now sit on the edge of your seat you know when someone is telling you something that you're really interested in would you sit on the edge of yours you can't wait to hear more let us see what the lord has before they received the holy spirit after they had an encounter with them with the word foreign now the bible says jesus was walking by the sea of galilee and his so true brethren now i want you to understand that there was no problem with these people being fishers praise the lord amen you see they have not been called by the lord jesus but they were by by you know by design all my career they were fishers [Music] they were made to be fishers [Music] now that is before you even receive the the holy ghost for you to have a gift you have a gift the moment you were born a child you have abilities the moment you were born when he was struggling and they were fishers yeah and he told them come follow me i will make you fish as a man it is not a fishing that is a problem it is where you are [Music] when jesus called us yes where peter we did not come to make us dummies director you can't do anything you can't go anywhere you can't watch anything you can't listen to anything they only carry you to church and back at home [Music] so it's what you are doing and where else follow me and i will make you fishers of men you want intended for them to remain fishers but you want the damn to be fishers of men james son of zebedee and john yeah and they were mending their nets and they called them and they immediately left their ships and their father went and followed him never came here to next time we are not here in the church this morning we had nothing to do we are not serving jesus christ because we had nothing to listen to we are worshiping and following jesus because this is what we were meant to do some people say i'm going to serve god because i have nothing i have nothing to do if you are serving god because you had nothing to do time will come and you will get something to do and you will stop serving god [Applause] satisfaction hallelujah amen so these men were enthused they were called but there was something you had to forsake for christ by the way every one of us has to forsake something for christ we have some people who do not want to forsake [Applause] his father flowing with me you know in business you cannot do a business without a risk does somebody call me remove that away you cannot do a business without a sacrifice these men were enthused with their calling but jesus did not call you so you become a good-for-nothing person yes and you ask them what do you do i'm a prayer warrior they are in the church every single hour every single day is it wrong to go in church every day but you must have something to do you must work or you know even just himself what now yes right so he did not call us they are treated to disappoint our life's calls if you're in school continue in school business continuing business [Applause] and he wanted to realign our expectations hallelujah when the lord he realized the world has ever seen and that [Music] [Applause] not sober dutch money back there is still way now we are confusing the fish and the fish you need to enter into my spirit now brother because i how can you interpret the fish and the fish unless you understand what i'm talking about right they were they were still confusing the fish of the sea what happened [Music] and after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this on on this wise showed he himself there were together simon peter and thomas called didmas and nathaniel nathaniel of khanna in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples simon peter said unto them i go off fishing they say unto him we are also coming with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing very was the man that jesus had said to go feed my sheep and here jesus has died yes we are far and has resurrected but the disciples have not yet met with them amen and peter quickly forgot and he led the disciples back to their old life uh peter was that man that commanded respect from the others he was intelligent but he was not educated he and he told him i want to make you a fish of mine security now to make to make you do what i wanted to do i want to make you a fish without education without a college thing without anything i will make you what i want it to be praise god this is what i've done all my life and still a peterson peter peter in his absence so then quickly manual he comes out available hallelujah i wanted to look at the scenario hallelujah amina okay so i want you to uh to look at the scenario here i just i just remove you bro okay so let's follow here there was thomas what about thomas c called didymus what did he move there was nathaniel assaniri unders i feel like going to fish wait a moment what was he doing from the time jesus called him from the sea you remember when jesus called them two by two and jesus was not with them yes the world was not with them they were no longer under the word they have not yet gone to the upper room they never have got that experience that encounter with jesus that you will come to church [Music] foreign is [Music] [Music] with [Music] no matter what you are doing never watching my teacher if you do not have an experience of the upper room it will not prosper if you think you are doing what you're doing because of you we just read it you just saw me they were fishing all night they were throwing here today i told them no no no no no no [Music] i just preached on abide [Music] [Music] [Music] you will not be like them out there [Music] [Music] [Music] to get something you would even get nothing too much do it because that is who you are and then go back and do his own thing they went there all night cast the nets they cast their nets [Music] was it because they did not know what they were doing they knew what they were doing and they failed to understand again and they went back in their old life let me tell you this is a temptation we have to overcome every day of our lives returning to the whole life hallelujah amen despite your experiences at sea in the world hallelujah it is not just a story situ ghetto it is a reality they called nothing magnesium they were meant to be fishes they were meant to be many fishes not fish fishes it is important to unders but if you are you are of the cold you cannot prosper by leaving your own aspiration and lifestyles hallelujah but when the morning was now coming jesus stood on the show yes i underlined this one hey machine when you are back sleeping the morning comes with cheetah bye and bye when the morning but when the morning now comes i'm a child we gotcha let me tell you morning is coming for somebody morning is coming for summer daddy don't want to wake up amen when the morning now come on jesus [Music] hallelujah amen do you think that jesus does not know all things foreign jesus knows [Music] [Applause] that [Music] [Music] interpret that for what it says on the right not the wrong side the right side of the ship hallelujah leave the left side come on the right side which is the right side amen what's the right side of it what is the right right side of the street it is the side of the wall it is the side of the hole [Music] [Applause] [Music] do you really think the whole night when i was a child peter did not even think of casting on the right side of the street there is a song which says if god says no nobody can say no why do you want me watch and see god will not prosper the bible says they call them multitude of fishes on which versus that create okay yeah verse eight managers will a man rob god yet he will a man drop god [Music] all your blessings come from [Music] god yes you have robbed me but you say well how are we robbed backwards is an offering with the curse calling you abruptly now here we go woman after receiving me and i will rebuke the devourer for your sis and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground subtle is the killer praise the name of the lord and not this church these people they cast the whole night but they didn't get nothing too many instructions but when jesus came yesterday they cast their name now when simon peter had that it was the lord he got his fishes caught unto him for he was naked and he did cast himself into the sea simon peter is the same man who told jesus me you will not wash my face and they said if i don't wash your feet then you will not you'll not even be a part of me and then he said okay not only my face wash my head and my whole body now here when he understood that it was jesus oh here he was naked dressed is [Applause] against you hallelujah amen others need praying with you you need jesus i don't need to steal you you need jesus christ you need jesus [Music] hallelujah praise the name of the lord so but they now needed the word to be made manifest in them so to sum them up so they can praise the lord remember verse eight and the other disciples came in and in a leadership for they were not far from the land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes [Music] yes others [Music] m okay again someone help me pull it out you're going to pull out okay hallelujah amen i picture myself right now i came from one of my brother come on [Applause] what's

those who came here on friday did not come up so i was concerned as a man i was strengthening and she kept on asking me do you really think he's okay that although do you really think he's okay you know everybody is gifted but my wife is gifted with uh uh a certain gift in did not know where to start from you know i have just finished my food no come around so i thought maybe i should die and joel was encouraging us also saying but now i have just finished my food nah come on i'm very hungry and i was not busy scenario and i saw the number you know the number i decided to pick it then so then this man speaks and says i am a updf officer if i think they're scams so i i was planning to do the same thing and then he continued speaking now you'll get up your son shame shame [Music] when he spoke that yeah i knew now that it is a problem and i knew he was not a scam he said he was knocked out [Music] but you need to come and pick him up wait i would join and take him to the hospital let me drive you so i stopped thinking my wife almost went into labour [Music] and uh i did not also tell her immediately i just walked out of the house and i remembered i have not told her when she killed my daughter is in trouble he decided to not go to their church so he can be here and help on them i drove like crazy and i reached there on the road a northern bypass someplace and uh and that this i want to say those we picked him up i noticed none of his bones were broken but he could not walk because he was unconscious quiet together and he had been there for a while but as soon as we carried him i smelled the strength of death name i did not know it was it him dying or was it death coming i did not know but i somehow also lost my mind i do not know he's eating him dying but as we were walking into the cross one of the updf officers you know there were about three of them with guns god provided watchmen over him all the time and this woman she was able to be patient she was like a mother mama uh she waited and waited until he gave the phone and this man was stopping me cutting home silicon achievement you know they were in uniform with the guy but also i mean it was a slope for such a big so the other in just a few microseconds but my wife told me later that god revealed it to her and she started praying that god revealed what was happening on the road and the man missed us just by few meters amen i cannot die but leave [Music] and so we went to the hospital and uh the doctor saw that i was bleeding you would understand if the ears bleeding it means maybe there is a brain injury or concussion somewhere or something and uh also there was a big damage we do not see even this one we saw it later that there was a a a damage on the head and so the um first of the year he quickly examined him medicine on him then he said we need to rush him to another hospital how to do a brain scan to determine whether it is a brain so later on he would come back and begin responding and so responded to instructions and then uh yesterday joe um we went to another hospital dragons to see another specialist recommendation of the doctor we had seen earlier he [Music] is it gone for good can you try that but the other side is in touch give us medication and say that uh we would need to go back after a while to go and check and do an examination who really came up i want to say god bless you but now we're going to have them come up and those who have sent prayers they never stole money but they didn't steal life and for that we are so grateful because even [Music] but i will need to step back with the ministers for a few moments oh okay yeah you said you also stepped back for a little moment so the rest you are all dismissed we meet on on wednesday we'll be here i will continue with this subject i'm not finished and jesus hello [Music] victory belongs victory belongs victory below dear lord to you [Music] victory belongs victory [Music] victory below who
