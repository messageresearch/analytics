Listen friends, we have come to worship him this morning. And I'd like you to in his presence, you know, talking about his greatness, how he has kept us, how he has guided us, how he has provided. Many are not alive to testify to him. But how many times did you think you reached your end, but God came through for you? So you have a reason to worship him, a reason to glorify him because indeed he's great in our life. Has he been great in your life? Well, if he has been great in your life, I want you to join me this morning. We're not just singing to, you know, be seen or be heard. You know, singing is a cry of our heart. a heart filled with gratitude for what the Lord has done for you. So I want you to loosen up yourself. I want you to relax in his presence. And you know this is a Sunday morning. It's a day of worship. We have come to worship. The Bible says the father is pleased with those that worship him in spirit and in truth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or just close your eyes and speak to him. Just worship him. Speak to him in worship. Let everybody just worship him in your own little way. If you are just streaming the service, just worship him. The Lord is in this place. The spirit is here to heal us, to raise us up, to encourage us, to bring us into an atmosphere of where all things are possible. An atmosphere which will make us realize that our God is great and is in our midst and he never fails. Oh, we have a reason to worship him. You made our way. Shalom. Come and help me, please. &gt;&gt; You made our way. &gt;&gt; I just feel like worshiping him this morning. Saints, &gt;&gt; when I bounce against the wall, and it looked as if it was over. You made our way. And we're standing here only because you made our way. Tell him once again you made our way. You only Jesus you only you know no one else. Oh, when our mask against the walls against the wall and it save for you and we're standing here only because you made a way. Sing one more time. Come on. You Hallelujah. You believe he made a way for you. Amen. He can make a way for you this morning. You made a way. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. My against the wall in the Lord &gt;&gt; and it looked as if it was. Oh, you made a way. You made a way. &gt;&gt; There is nothing here. only because you made a way. If this has not happened for you yet, just believe it will happen for you. You move mountains, you cause walls to fall with your power. You perform miracles. There is nothing. Oh, the simposible for we standing here only because you made a way. You move mountain. You might you cause wants to fall in our lives every day. Oh, that's why we worship you, Lord.

Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah Lord. Father Lord we worship you this morning. We give you thanks. Everybody just worship. Let us pray. Just pray together. This is a house of worship. Amen. That his house shall be called a house of worship. Oh, thank you Lord for your grace and for the way that you have done for each and every one of us. Father, you have been so faithful indeed. Oh God, we are here to worship you. We're here to give you praise and honor because you deserve it, Father. You have done so much, but we cannot tell it to. We are so happy, oh God, because you have given us breath and an opportunity to live for you, an opportunity to worship you in spirit. You made a way for us in this generation and send us a message, oh God, our hearts back again, came into the hearts of the apostolic fathers. And now we are standing here in this last moment, last time. waiting for the change of our polit. We know it's a living reality, Lord. Oh, we give you glory. We give you honor, Lord. And I pray that you'll come and have your way in this service in the name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you, saints. Just take a moment to sit down. Marvin. &gt;&gt; So, um, are you ready? &gt;&gt; Uh, this morning I just want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's 10%. I said I'm greeting you in the name of Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be back home. I I'll tell you friends um I'll be a liar if I tell you that I have any place that I feel more comfortable than when I'm here. They say east and west home is best. Amen. And I know when it rains, some people feel that it's not possible to come to church, but I'm also aware some are still struggling through. Amen. And that's why we took a little moment to wait on some of them. So, uh, this morning, I just want to say first of all, thank you to those who prayed for me. Uh, the Lord blessed you so much. He answered your prayers, brother Andrew. Andrew, God answered your prayers and um he gave me a real safe trip. It was my first time to go in this part of the world and so I did not know what to expect. But uh it was what what I can tell you even now it's like I'm still flying in in the head. &gt;&gt; It was quite a long long trip. &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to uh show you a few pictures. Brothers, if you can dim this light so that uh people can see the pictures. Um, you know, it was a long trip and um and um you know this u I want you to pray for me this morning that I'll be in the same frequency with the Holy Spirit because to be frank I'm tired. My wife was telling me, "Is it a must for you to preach?" And uh so well to me it's a duty. And and really even the reason why we travel is why brothers travel and they come all the way thousands of kilometers and why we travel thousands of miles to where they are because of the gospel. There is no other reason. And um you know if you're called to minister, you are not called to one little place. The gift that God gave you is for the entire body of Christ. And this is all over the world. We believe that for Jesus said go only to preach the gospel. What did he say? all the world &gt;&gt; and and so you should be proud to have a pastor that is fulfilling that commit that command that the Lord gave you. But I want I want to tell it's just the grace of God. So um brother can you give me the next slide? &gt;&gt; Okay. So when I I went &gt;&gt; um I arrived uh in Toronto Toronto &gt;&gt; over there down there and um I I I had to take after there I had to take another flight to Vancouver which is about 5 hours. Vancouver, Toronto is like the east of Canada. So then you have travel again all the way west to Vancouver and um give me the next slide there. Brother brother Michael received me and I was happy to see him. You know, I've always received him on this side. For the first time, he received me on this side. Um, give me the next slide. Um, there's a lot of pictures and a lot of things I would have showed you, but I have a reason for everything I show you. Now, many places I've gone to, but uh, you know, this place was a bit special for me. Because whatever the Lord did in this place through the ministry by the Edis has really affected many ministries all over the world. Actually I was in Zimbabwe when we were dedicating um when we were at the dedication of uh Pastor Chikos's church in Har. shocked when I heard him as he was giving or reading out his testimony and he said that brother Eddie Biscal uh uh ordained him in the ministry and you know brother Chikosi is one of the elders I can say in Africa. So you can see that brother Edbel's ministry has had a great impact I was one of the very last to be impacted by this. Um you know this is a man that whose ministry impacted was impacted by the life and ministry of brother directly. And so you see this house. I hope brother Isaac we are also having these pictures online for us. So this house I was able to see it actually but the Michael showed it to me. Uh but it was called by they called it Bible way house &gt;&gt; Bible way house. It was the the place where the the church started and you know they were staying uh you know and you know they were many students were coming in and you know hearing the message. It made me feel like at DVF because we have a lot of students, young ones, they all started as young people. But of course, this is this is in the 70s and now many years later when you see what the Lord has done all over the world through the ministry there really it it shows you that Jesus Christ never fails. And when he sets out to do a work, he accomplishes it. Give me the next slide. And uh that that's brother Ed there. And you know, I've placed my picture on the side and I wanted to tell you I I felt when I was there, I felt deeply honored to finally stand on the platform of a person that I've taken as my mentor in this ministry of the um also you know As I as we were entering the building, &gt;&gt; you know, as I was entering, brother Michael was taking me, you know, before the service. It was a very, very emotional time for me. You know, brother Isaac and saw it later, but others who saw me earlier, you know, know that I was listening service after service after service that was preached in this place. Just give me I I have a lot to say but you know we don't have the whole day but let's go to uh this brother this uh I I thought I he asked me to greet the church and uh brother his name is brother Jonathan Jonathan &gt;&gt; you know at that time he was um you know uh in school and he came and he attended my wedding. He was one of those attended my way and so I was happy to see him after all these years. He's now married with a with a child and so that is his family right there. Give me the next slide and uh sister Lisa and her family asked me to greet you as well. You know, uh, some some people are wondering how come you made, you know, the white brethren to sing a Luganda song. &gt;&gt; How many were able to watch to see that song? Actually, it was not me who made them sing. It was them who made me sing it. So, they they requested that if we could sing the song and you know, they watch most of our services here. So, and I was surprised that they could sing it. So, I I told, "Are you sure? ARE YOU READY?" SAY, "YEAH, YEAH." And uh it really went. Did it not go so well? That was really nice. So, that was brother Jeremiah over there &gt;&gt; and and his uh wife. I think the next one there right there, &gt;&gt; Sister Anna Hope. &gt;&gt; Sister Anna Hope is a daughter to Sister Liisa right there. Now, Sister Lisa is not a new name here &gt;&gt; because I think in our second youth camp, &gt;&gt; you remember the Bibles we distributed. She just had a burden and she wrote me and said, "Look, I have a burden to give to the young people Bibles for those who don't have Bibles. They don't have very much." But you know she struggled and and made it possible to make to to distribute all those Bibles. &gt;&gt; And so they sent greetings to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me the next slide. Uh this is a brother. He's a senior brother there in the church. Um uh is originally from Nigeria. Nigeria. &gt;&gt; You you will remember brother Victor who Victor &gt;&gt; who came and ministered. How many remember? Brother Victor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is the father to brother Victor. Victor. &gt;&gt; So he's also called Victor. Brother Victor. Victor. &gt;&gt; So he um he was the when I was contacting brother Ed in the early years, he was the brother that brother Ed Bis asked to contact me and to find out what type of person I was. and uh I think he gave a good report. So he's a he's a nice brother and we we had some little nice fellowship and it was a wonderful time and um I'll give you the next slide there. Yeah. So that those are are the um children of brother Tom &gt;&gt; you know brother Michael who has ministered for us here several times and by the way I'm of the understanding he's going to be coming to u uh I had invited him to come and preach in our youth camp and because they were coming so he wasn't too sure whether he would be able to come back so soon so um but um then things happen and there's a some projects we are working on of of translation of the audio message. So he thought and then he got another invitation from brother Steven to come and take the youth cup. I think he in campala of lifeboat. So I'm of the understanding he he might actually come for that youth camp and he we shall also have him maybe for a service or so. Um, so you don't want to miss that youth camp because one of our very own will be there and he's a very good minister. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so um I really had some wonderful wonderful fellowship with the with the family and you know brother Tom's family extended family. I wish I could but I some pictures I've withheld but I was very glad to you know meet sister Ruth also &gt;&gt; you know and she told me a few words and how thought of me and things like that which meant very much to us. Uh those saints asked me to greet the church and uh so as many of you already saw we took a service there. We we took a service there &gt;&gt; and uh the Lord was gracious. &gt;&gt; So um that was my first leg and uh give me the next slide. So from from Vancouver right here. We now had to fly back all the way to Toronto Toronto. And actually now the next phase that the pictures I'm going to show you I can tell you was the main reason of my original plans to go to Canada. Um because you give me the next slide. If you see brother Hapto there received me and for the first time someone gave me a flower and I thought he was amazing. He was so happy and there's quite a lot I can say but I want to say this invitation by brother Hapto all goes back give me the next slide to the wedding preparations of brother Giri and sister Yodit you know brother Gir sister Yodit as you know was the very first uh was the second person actually the very first woman, but the first um the the second but the very first sister to be baptized and um now through her. We started reaching out to very many people, many of the others who actually believed was because of this including her husband, brother Giri. &gt;&gt; I remember the first time brother Giri heard of the message. You know, sister Yod introduced her to us. So she came, brother, he came to meet me and we talked and talked and then he he told me, "Where is this message that you're talking about? I told him well I have it. He said um he brought his laptop and he told me can you pack it all here? So we loaded it on the laptop and he went away for one month and he came back after one month with red eyes and he was seriously studying the message. I can tell you he's one of the brothers that really believe the message after understanding the message very well. He told me now I'm ready for baptism. And so I've never shared brother's testimony. That's so brother Gai of course had been in the trintarians the one the apostolic church. So now when he was going to get engaged with uh sister Yodi, the day they were going to get engaged, the day they were going to announce their engagement in the church. So brother Gurimai um brought some of his friends and one of them happened to be brother Habton. That's why when you are going to have a wedding or if you're going to have uh announce your engagement, invite your friends who are non-believers because that's an opportunity for them to hear the message. You don't know what God is planning after that. So he invited up brother Hapto. So, Habtom came and uh he heard what we had to say and he was impressed. So, he came and sat down with me and we talked and talked and talked and talked and he he saw the message. The hand of the Lord was revealed for him and give me the next slide and he was baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus. And uh this was on 4th November 2016. That the water you seen up there that that was really very cold. That's the coldest I've ever placed in. And so give me the next slide. You can see those some of those pictures. Uh if you see that man in the blue suit, that's brother Habtom. &gt;&gt; And um you know this is the wedding. Now uh he was the best man. &gt;&gt; And if you notice he was baptized. He came he came for the how do you call the the announcing of the engagement engagement as a nonbeliever. and uh on 4th November he's baptized on 12th November he's coming back as a believer now to be the best man of the of the brother at his wedding if he want it may God also do it for I thought that was a a blessing amen and give me the next slide and on 6th December His wife was also baptized &gt;&gt; by brother Paul, &gt;&gt; a friend of mine that had come in at that time I was in in the north doing but uh you know but she kept on coming to here and we would meet her several times then finally she accepted and believed and was baptized on 6th December 2016. December. &gt;&gt; Give me the next slide. January 7th, 2017, they do their wedding. And that happened to be the second wedding in the church. Praise the Lord. Give me the next slide. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, September we recently when I was in Ethiopia, I meet with brother Habam again. Of course, he had told me that uh they they he had moved to Canada &gt;&gt; and I had already connected him with pastor John there. So he was going to church but you know when I met him he told me I have this burden to reach out to my people there. Brother HTM is But he he has also lived in Ethiopia for many years and and and so it tells me I have this burden to reach the people in um in Canada and he asks me says pastor can you come and help me to to speak to some of them and so that's one of the reasons why we wanted to go give me The next slide. We met several brethren. This is one of them and I wanted to show you this so that you can pray. He's a minister of the gospel. He's called pastor Ephraim. Please remember that name in prayer. I believe that that brother will receive this message. Give me the next slide. Uh okay. That's one of the churches I uh in this place Kitchen called Kitchen is a is a the pastor there is brother Joseph &gt;&gt; and so they also sent their greetings. Next slide. I think brother Joseph by the way has been to Uganda. &gt;&gt; Okay. This is uh another now the church of pastor John in &gt;&gt; in Toronto Toronto &gt;&gt; and um uh we were we also visited there and ministered three services. &gt;&gt; Give me the next slide. Uh okay. So right there I want to show you uh okay I'm trying to look at the pictures here to see who is who. So I can say now if you see the picture on the right &gt;&gt; that is brother &gt;&gt; Habton and the pastor John &gt;&gt; pastor Johnny's wife &gt;&gt; brother Alan one of the associate ministers and his wife and myself but if you look to the this picture to the left brother, a brother called brother Calbal. &gt;&gt; This is one of the brothers that we have really spent time with quality quality time with and he came with us um you know after you know all the time we spent with him. So of course he's still in the denominations but um he came and uh by God's grace we were able to um be with him at the church. And um he wanted also his wife to come and pastor John was very very gracious. In the next service we were going to preach there uh because I was leaving in in a place called Kitchener and the church is in Toronto that's about 1 hour away. Pastor John was able to, you know, find a hotel room for them and for myself close so that we can, you know, have some time more in the word. Give me the next slide. So, uh, so that's pastor John. It is not a young man. He's preached this message for more than 50 years. He's originally from Ghana. I tell you, he's done a great work in that. And so that's his wife. And this is the brother I'm talking to you about, brother Calb. And his wife Luna, Sister Luna, uh, you know, Sister Luna was imprisoned for four years. &gt;&gt; Sister in it because of Jesus Christ. She could have come out if she had recounted, but she did not because that's how much she loves Jesus. I felt and you know when when as I was sharing with them I felt like this is she's another oh man she she's just on you know she loves the work you go in. So her and her husband I believe they would really be a great support brother. &gt;&gt; And so um and the good news is after all the conversations we have you know brother brother Calb made a decision to be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and his wife is not yet there yet but probably brother Calb might be baptized this Sunday. When I hear the testimonies I'll share with you, I remember they're just a lovely, lovely couple. &gt;&gt; They've recently come into Canada as well, and so please remember them in prayer with Amen. And then we also had, give me the next slide, another uh time in another church, the last service minister Pastor Gerald who is seated right right here &gt;&gt; and they also sent greetings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I think you you now at least have in your mind a little bit of brother just hold it there a moment. You have a little bit in your mind uh what um happened when I was in and thank you for praying. Um, I want to show you this next slide because it inspired what I'm going to speak this morning. Three little monkeys. So, when I was at the church in Ker uh at Pastor Jose's church. I saw these three little monkeys on his desk. And for some reason, I had never read what Brother Bam said about it. And this is what he said. I'm going to read for you. and then we shall stand and read the scripture. So give me a moment. Let me find a good little thing you ought to set around on your desk. It's a little thing I had seen down in Florida not long ago. It was three little monkeys and one of them had his hands over his eyes and said, "See no evil, and the other had one hand his fingers on his ears, said, "Hear no evil. And the other one had his fingers in his ears. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, and the other on on his mouth he said speak not. I think that's a good thing. Don't you? That's a very good thing. And I thought I should also show you where I got that inspiration. And today I will be speaking on keep your mind pure on Christ. But before we go into the reading of the word, I'd like to invite um uh it's um brother Steven told me about this um sister Olivia rather she would like to dedicate a child Is she here? &gt;&gt; Can the musicians play for us? Bring them in. And then we shall stand and read the scripture afterwards. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring bring them in from the field of sin. Oh, bring them in. &gt;&gt; Bring them in. &gt;&gt; Bring the little ones to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says that all life comes from God. And so the mother is is the father of the child here? No. Okay. So we are going the child is called Christian. And so let us bow our heads and our heavenly father we have come here before your presence. Lord, we know that all life comes from you. And Lord, this couple has desired to dedicate this child because they recognize this child is not their own making. But it's a life from you, Father. We want to also receive this child on your behalf, and we want to dedicate him to you, Lord. And we want to pray that is her life will be a life of service unto Jesus Christ. The Lord you'll preserve this child from all the powers of darkness you'll keep her Lord from whatever that the enemy might want to to to do in her life. And Lord, whatever that might even have been go uh that might have gone through uh the blood of our parents in the past that has not been good. Father Lord, I pray that you will save her from all that nothing will follow her that's not of God. And Lord, I pray as I dedicate this child unto you, oh God, that you preserve this life and it will be a life of a testimony. Lord, we know that except you use a person or dear father, the enemy will always come and try to possess them. But Lord, you're possessing this child at a very young age right now. Lord, I pray that you will use her and Lord, you provide even for the parents who take care of her. I also pray Lord Jesus that you preserve her from sickness. You preserve her from everything that the the enemy might want to throw in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Father, in the name of Jesus, we dedicate Christian unto you, Lord, for the glory of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. &gt;&gt; Shall we stand? &gt;&gt; We have a visitor also. I'm told brother John from God bless you. Thank you for coming my brother. We are happy to have you. We are going to read from the book of Titus. I will not be very long this morning. So I just want you to stay with me and be in the same spirit as we try to see what the Holy Spirit will speak to will speak to us today. We are reading verses 15. Let us first pray. My heavenly father Lord I come before you this morning Lord just reporting to duty knowing Lord that I have nothing good in myself. I have no abilities Lord. I'm even weary in the body. But Father, I ask that you may come and have your way. May may your word go. May your words of life go through these lips and even through the brother who is going to interpret. And may everyone Lord get connected to the supernatural God who does the supernatural things. And may you bring to us the supernatural word this morning which will encourage us in our future. Father we love you. We give you praise. We give you honor in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are reading verses 15. Unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure. But even their mind and conscience is defiled. Amen. You may be seated. I have greetings here. Brother Ken asked me to greet you this morning. How many we are blessed by that service? &gt;&gt; Amen. and also pastor Cece from the USA. &gt;&gt; Actually the place where he was the place where he was in Toronto is not far away. Pastor Cis is going to be here this coming month and we will be going with him to Karamoja. they have a convention there and they ask me to to come and you know usually if I'm invited to Karamoja I always desire to take you know other ministry which I know will be a blessing there and uh so I would like you to to remember that in prayers uh so pastor sister will be here with us &gt;&gt; in the month of December Um, I'll also pray for the Kamoja meetings. There's quite a lot. You know, November and December is filled with weddings, introduction ceremonies, and you know, meetings and so it's quite a lot going on. But you know, we are going to go through it today. So if someone is having a wedding or something, stand with them. You know, together we are strong. But if you are we are isolated then we cannot be strong. Pastor Tom Ray sent his greetings and brother Michael &gt;&gt; and also pastor John Dana pastor Jose already told you from they sent their greetings and I just wanted to make sure I don't forget them. So are we ready for the word this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask your neighbor, are you ready for the work? &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unto the pure, all things are, but unto them that are defiled, and unbelieving is nothing pure. I kind of feel I might not do justice to this subject today. Uh but if that is the case then we will continue in another service. But for this service I I just want maybe to give it an introduction. Keep your mind pure on Christ. There are many there are three things three major things they talk about. your mind, purity and Christ. So I may not cover all of them. I'm trying to say, you know, someone might quickly think that we are speaking of meats, meats, meats, you know, when you talk about things that are pure and things that are defiled. But you see this scripture is very rich. It goes way beyond that and it speaks of one's mind and one's conscious. But before we get into that, let's also examine a little bit about on this issue of meat. Romans chapter 14 vers 13. Let us not therefore judge one another anymore, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. And I would like you to follow me closely and help me to preach to you because I am weary in the body. I've been preaching service after service plus traveling and you know there's a big time difference. So that brings what maybe they called jet lag or whatever but so you feel like you're floating, you're tired, you you know you just help me to preach to you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now if you look in the New Testament, the Bible speaks so much or rather God has a concern about his elect, about his children, about his seed. Remember this inspiration came from see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. If all of us practiced it, we will be the representatives of Jesus on earth. Our conscience is means so much. And God also minds about uh your brother's conscience, your brother's mind, you know. And the Bible even goes ahead to say, "Let us therefore judge one another. Let us not judge one another anymore. But judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. There there's a lot I'm going to talk about this morning. Do you know conscious is a very important thing that someone you know you may be seeing someone as an angel and someone tell you something bad about them and from that moment onwards your conscience will be defiled and your attitude You will be SPOILED and your words will be bad simply you had because you had evil. But the Bible says, "LET NO MAN put a stumbling block or AN OCCASION TO fall in his brother's way." And he says, "I KNOW AND I'M PERSUADED BY the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself. Now here of course is going into meats as I told you, but to him that esteemth anything to be unclean. Tell your neighbor to the pure all things are pure. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT? &gt;&gt; SO THERE is nothing unclean but to him that it is unclean. But if you esteem something to be unclean, then to you it is unclean. I'll give you an example. Okay, here he's going to talk about meats. But even other things, for example, like a like a necklace, a a nice little simple necklace. You will find some people especially those who go the direction of legalism will tell you oh it is SATANIC but you see it's not biblical for you to say satanic it is not unclean it is not against the scripture but if you wearing it is going to stumble your brother or your sister, then you better not wear it. &gt;&gt; I'll come to that. I'll come to that. BUT IF YOUR BROTHER BE GRIEVED WITH THY MEAT, now thou not charitably. Torture. If your brother is is grieved, listen, interpret this. If your brother is grieved because of what you are eating, AND YOU YOU INSIST TO ME it is okay and you you eat it in his face. It means YOU DON'T HAVE LOVE. YOU ARE NOT WALKING in love. And yet the Bible instructs us to walk in love. BUT IF YOU LOVE HIM, IF YOU LOVE HER, YOU WILL NOT DO CERTAIN THINGS. YOU WILL NOT EAT CERTAIN THINGS before your brother who is weak. LET US CONTINUE. DESTROY NOT HIM WITH thy mate FOR WHOM CHRIST DIED. MEANING YOU CAN DESTROY SOMEONE BY HOW YOU BEHAVE, BY WHAT YOU DO, EVEN IF IT IS NOT EVIL. EVEN if it is not unclean, but you enjoying it and using it before them will destroy them. And yet Christ died for them. You know, we have what we call naughtiness, being not. &gt;&gt; I don't know whether that's the word, but you know, but Some parents they really treat their children in a naughty way. Don't do that. DON'T MAKE THEM. DID YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW GOD ALSO LOOKS AT HIS CHURCH? HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE GRIEVING HIS CHURCH SON OR DAUGHTER. WHY? Because you I AM THE PURCHASE OF THE BLOOD. HE WANTS US TO BE HAPPY ALL THE TIME. HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO OFFEND US. HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO LAY A STUMBLING BLOCK FOR US. SO I want TO SHOW YOU CHURCH HOW DO WE LIVE as believers as a body in unity in love. IT MEANS WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE of one another. Okay. Let not then your good be evil spoken of. For the kingdom OF GOD IS NOT MEAT AND DRINK. OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is not meat and drink. The kingdom of God is not dos and don'ts. Are you hearing me? THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS not laws and rules. THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS RIGHTEOUSNESS, IS PEACE, AND JOY IN THE HOLY GHOST. NOW, I'm going to break it down for you later. FOR HE THAT FOR HE THAT IN these things serve Christ is acceptable TO GOD. AND approved of men. Let us therefore follow after these things which make for peace and the things wherewith one may edify another FOR IT DESTROY NOT THE WORK OF GOD. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for that for that man who eateth with offense. &gt;&gt; It is good neither to eat flesh nor TO DRINK WINE, NOR ANYTHING WHEREBY THY BROTHER STUMBLE. or is offended or is made weak. That's why believers we live the way we live. That's why we dress THE WAY WE DRESS. THAT'S WHY WE EAT WHAT WE EAT. NOT BECAUSE IF WE DO WHAT WHAT THEY DO, WE WILL GO TO HELL. NO. BUT BECAUSE WE ARE AVOIDING STUMBLING ONE ANOTHER, WE WANT OUR BROTHER NOT TO BE STUMBLED. You know the ones in the world don't care what anybody thinks. Okay, you don't need to interpret that. But you see, SO THEY DO THINGS THEY DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY. SPEAK. &gt;&gt; You see, it means you do not have the spirit of Christ in your heart. But if you have the spirit of Christ, you you mind how your brother feels. YOU MIND HOW YOUR BROTHER THINKS ABOUT YOU. YOU YOU ARE CAREFUL, NOT to hurt them, NOT TO MAKE THEM WEAK NOT TO OFFEND THEM, NOT TO STUMBLE THEM. THAT'S HOW THE SPIRIT OF Christ is, friends. But but but now HE GOES AHEAD TO SAY, but the kingdom of God, I hope that today you'll be able to see something. The kingdom of God is not meat and drink. AND HERE HE ADDED, "OH, ANYTHING that stumbles your brother, wine or something that offends them or something that makes them weak." It doesn't have to be foods only. What What is it trying to say? Rules, regulations, dawn. And it has come to a place where many believers actually think that this message is ruled. This the message is dos and don'ts. And they know for as long as I do this and I do that, I'm going to heaven. The one who doesn't that is not going. And you find when someone comes in the church not doing what they're doing, people will be offended. They will look at him with those judgment eyes. You don't belong here. And the person will feel it. AND THE person will go away not desiring to come back again. He didn't see love in your heart. How many of you have non-believers as friends and you have even failed to invite them to church or you fear to invite them to church because you don't want them to be judged or you don't want to judge them or sometimes you can tell your friend come to my church BUT BEFORE YOU COME MAKE sure you dress this way make sure you dress that way make sure you dress this way are Are you following me? You know you are killing that person because he is not of your tribe yet. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND YOUR LANGUAGE. IT IS a believer who must take care of the weaker believer. Hallelujah. But a strong believer MUST GIVE GRACE TO THE ONE WHO HAS NO REVELATION. YOU MUST GIVE GRACE TO SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT SEEN WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN to someone WHO HAS NOT REACHED YOUR LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD. If she's a LADY AND SHE'S WEARING PANTS, WE CALL THEM TROUSERS, YOU KNOW. DON'T JUDGE HER. BRING INVITE HER TO CHURCH. IF SHE'S WEARING MAKEUP AND EARRINGS and everything, DON'T LOOK AT THAT. IF YOU TELL HER TO REMOVE THEM, SHE WILL REMOVE THEM. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN SHE HAS CHANGED. SHE'S STILL THE WAY SHE WAS. WHEN SHE SHE REMOVES THEM, SOME OF THEM REMOVE them when THEY'RE COMING TO CHURCH. WHEN THEY GO BACK, THEY THEY PUT IT ON. SOME OF THEM DRESS VERY WELL WHEN THEY COMING HERE. WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOLS, THEY DRESS LIKE WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT FOUND THAT GRACE AND THAT REVELATION TO UNDERSTAND THE WORD. YOU SEE, SO THE CHANGE IS COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE. BUT THE CHANGE MUST NEVER COME FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE CHANGE MUST COME FROM THE INSIDE. WHAT I'M SAYING, STOP PRETENDING. HAVE A PURE MIND. HAVE A PURE HEART. GOD WILL BE PLEASED. WHEN YOU COME BEFORE HIM PURE, THE BIBLE SAYS TO THE PURE ALL THINGS ARE PURE. AMEN. LET HER DRESS UP PURELY. BUT WHEN SHE HEARS the word, oh, are you following me, Brother Ivan? WHEN SHE HEARS THE WORD, YOU KNOW what the word does? The word convicts. The word touches. How many of you can say I've ever been convicted by the word? You see what I'm saying? The word when you hear the word, YOU WILL TRY TO RUN AWAY FROM IT. YOU WILL TRY TO REASON WITH IT. YOU WILL TRY ALL THINGS. BUT IF YOU A SIN OF GOD, YOU CANNOT RUN AWAY FROM THE WORD. ONE OF THE DAYS, THE WORD WILL GRIP YOU. THE WORLD WILL ARREST YOU AND YOU WILL HAVE NOWHERE TO RUN. BUT YOU SAY, "LORD, I'M SORRY. I AM READY TO CHANGE. I'M READY TO DO YOUR WILL. LET ME TELL YOU, I I LOVE A CHURCH THAT IS OF A PEOPLE WITH A PURE MIND. If you don't have a pure mind, you cannot serve your brothers. You cannot serve your sisters. who cannot serve God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Let not then your good be evil spoken of. FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS not meat and drink. THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NOT rules of don't EAT THIS, DON'T DRINK THAT, DON'T DO THIS, DON'T DO THAT. BUT WHAT'S THE KINGDOM OF GOD? THE KINGDOM OF GOD is righteousness. Everybody say righteousness. Now, WHAT IS RIGHTEOUSNESS? That's a good one. You would think that righteousness is actually um you know doing good things. But what does the Bible say? THAT YOUR WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ARE WHAT? Filthy rags before God. &gt;&gt; I don't eat pork. I don't eat what? Which other things don't they eat? I don't eat. &gt;&gt; I don't drink alcohol. me. I don't put on short clothes. I don't do this. I don't do that. I don't do this. I am me. I am not like them. That is legalism. You are under the spirit of legalism. You've not found the righteousness of God, but you have your own righteousness and you are actually selfrighteous. What am I trying to say? Because you look at them and you compare yourself with them and you say they are they have not reached my level. Look at them. see how they address and they calling themselves believers. Which heaven are they going to? Those ones are chicken. For me, I'm the ego. It is self-righteousness and IT IS A SIN. If if you it means you you are not pure. Some of these people are doing these things when they are pure. They don't know. Their mind is not yet clean. But you see, just let them come under the word. &gt;&gt; You know, when they receive the word, they'll receive another mind. THE MIND OF CHRIST WHICH WILL GIVE THEM ANOTHER PURITY. AMEN. AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, HOW DO YOU RECEIVE THIS RIGHTEOUSNESS? YOU DON'T RECEIVE THIS RIGHTEOUSNESS BY DOING ANYTHING. YOU RECEIVE Oh my. Are you FOLLOWING ME? YOU RECEIVE THIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. AMEN. BY BELIEVING THE WORD. THE BIBLE SAYS ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD AND IT WAS COUNTED UNTO HIM FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS. SO WHAT DID ABRAHAM DO TO BE COUNTED AS A RIGHTEOUS MAN? HE BELIEVED GOD. HE BELIEVED THE WORD. GOD IS THE WORD. WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD and you BELIEVE THE WORD, THEN GOD WILL SAY, "YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS." HALLELUJAH. You are righteous. Amen. THIS IS THE KIND THAT COMETH NOT BY YOUR WORKS, BUT BY FAITH IN A FINISHED WORK OF CHRIST. YOU SEE, FAITH IN THE FINISHED WORK OF CHRIST produces the works. Now, Abraham did not go and say you see I'm better than all others. I'm even sacrificing my boy. Who has ever DONE THAT? WHO IN THE WORLD HAS EVER DONE THAT? I AM BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM. &gt;&gt; NO, that's not the attitude. &gt;&gt; What was What did Abraham do? &gt;&gt; Abraham only heard the word. THE WORD SAID, ABRAHAM, GO AND SACRIFICE YOUR SON TO HIM. Go and sacrifice yourself. All right, my Lord. No questioning, no doubting. HIS HEART WAS FIXED ON HEARING, BELIEVING AND DOING THE WORK. AMEN. Praise God. So if you A BELIEVER LIKE THAT, YOU WILL HAVE simple faith, you read in the scriptures WHERE IT SAYS AND YOU know we have always talked about it but let us read it in the Old Testament. is I think I've never read it for you here. Right. &gt;&gt; Theonomy 22. I want you to see something perhaps in a different way than you have ever seen it. The woman shall not wear that which pertainth unto a man. Neither shall a man put on a woman's garment. For all that do so abomination what others are not accepting. A WHAT? Unto who? unto the Lord thy God. So now you are not going to debate with THE WORD. ACCORDING to God, there are women clothes and there are men's clothes. Is that a man? So now you as a child of God who has the Holy Ghost. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE QUESTION in your heart. You're going to have one question in your heart. You're going to have one question in your heart. What is a man's cloth? What is a woman's clothes? Lord, what is YOUR WILL FOR ME? WHAT you know, a a child of God that is filled with the SPIRIT desires to please God. But the BIBLE SAYS WITHOUT WHAT? FAITH. You can never PLEASE GOD. SO FAITH, WHAT IS FAITH? FAITH IS A SUBSTANCE OF THINGS hoped for, an evidence of things NOT SEEN. BUT THEN BROTHER BHAM COMES AND HE TELLS US FAITH IS A REVELATION OF THE WILL OF GOD. SO NOW WHAT IF YOU HAVE THE REVELATION OF THE WILL OF GOD THEN YOU WILL DO IT without question. So you know, oh there's a woman's CLOTHES OR THERE'S A MAN'S cloth and then you read in the in the New Testament and you see the Bible saying uh first Timothy 2:9 in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and so not with hair or god of ps or costly array. Read, read, read, read. Because that is a very good interpretation, but you have to make sure it is perfect. Amen. 1 Timothy 2:9. Praise God. Oh my. Are you sober? Ask your neighbor, are you sober? &gt;&gt; Okay, let us learn something here. &gt;&gt; If you have a problem with sound, come close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll feel it. You'll hear it. Now, &gt;&gt; let us learn something here. I want our church. this little assembly here to know the message not as a law but to have the right approach to it. You see here now when Paul comes of course this is under grace he doesn't even bring thou shalt not but then what he says that in like manner also that women Let them adorn themselves in modest upper. Now, now tell me which one is modest and which one is not. Do you know which one is not modest? Who makes the judgment? And that's the problem that many times you make the judgment. But you cannot make a judgment for the law of God. The law of God is perfect and you don't need to add your mind. So what you need is faith to fulfill it. Faith is a revelation from God. God will REVEAL TO YOU HOW by his spirit. THAT'S WHY it is a must for each of us to be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Then the the works that we do will be coming out of the revelation by the spirit. So then you can know the MODEST APPAREL. HE SAYS NOT with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array. So then someone said oh the Bible says they should not braid hair but then also says that you should not have costly arly clothes. So which which one is expensive and which one is not? Are we going to have deacons that will always be on the door when a SISTER COMES IN? AH SISTER, how much is this one? Are you sure you have you are not buying you? You can go you. But you the way I'm seeing isn't this 5 million. So how are you going to judge those things? But to a TO A MIND THAT DOES NOT ALL THAT IS NOT PURE IS NOT LED BY THE HOLY GHOST. THEY WILL PUT A LAW. ALL SISTERS HAIR MUST LOOK like this. All of THEM SHOULD DRESS CLOTHES like this. They should be this long. THEY MUST BE. SO BECAUSE YOU SEE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST. THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IS THE ONE THAT MUST GUIDE YOU AND TEACH YOU AND REMIND YOU THE LAWS OF GOD BECAUSE THE LAWS OF GOD ARE RIGHTEOUS AND ARE PERFECT. BUT IN OURSELVES WE CANNOT ATTAIN THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS. SO THEN WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO? WE NEED TO HAVE FAITH IN GOD. BUT FAITH COMES BY REVELATION. As you hear the word, then revelation strikes you. And you know, you cannot even understand it unless you born again. Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness. Praise God. You know if someone is filled with the Holy Ghost and one is not you tell him a sister today you're really dressing a very short dress and a sister who is not food with all of us will tell you ah it is okay I don't see a problem and then you if you don't have a pure mind then you'll begin talking about her Did you see how she was raised? Did you see how he was? And then people's minds is no longer on Christ, but it becomes, you know, defiled. It's all about what to eat, what do But you see, Abraham simply believed God. And God said, "You are righteous. When it came to sacrificing his son, it was not a problem because Abraham was A BELIEVER. WHATEVER GOD SAID, HE WAS WILLING TO DO. AMEN. And that kind of um uh faith produces works. He says the kingdom of God is righteousness and peace. He says, "Peace I leave with you. My peace I GIVE UNTO YOU. NOT AS THE WORLD GIVES, but let not your HEART BE TROUBLED. Neither let LET IT BE AFRAID. SO IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU ARE IN CHRIST, YOU ARE ALWAYS AT PEACE. AMEN. YOU ARE NOT SEEKING FOR PEACE. PEACE IS A PART OF YOUR LIFE. SISTER, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT, YOU ARE MISSING A LOT. BECAUSE IF YOU RECEIVE THE SPIRIT, THEN YOU WILL ALWAYS BE AT PEACE. AND THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING SHALL KEEP YOUR HEART AND KEEP YOUR MIND THROUGH Christ Jesus. THIS PEACE PASSES ALL UNDERSTAND. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, even when you ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE, EVEN WHEN YOU ARE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING HARD AND TERRIBLE, THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CERTAIN PEACE. You know why? BECAUSE A BELIEVER MUST ALWAYS BE AT PEACE, BROTHER. IF YOU DON'T HAVE PEACE IN YOUR HEART, YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. NO MATTER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN YOUR LIFE, YOU MUST ALWAYS BE AT PEACE. LET YOUR HEART NOT BE TROUBLED. AMEN. FOR THE PEACE THAT PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING SHALL ALWAYS KEEP YOUR HEART. AMEN. AND MIND THAT the key mind through Christ Jesus we are coming back to this. I'm just giving you foundation here now. joy and he says also the kingdom of God is joy IN THE HOLY GHOST. YOU SEE THIS IS THE KIND OF JOY THAT DOES NOT go away even in the midst of sufferings in the midst of trials and much tribulations after Paul and Barnabas WERE REJECTED. The scripture in Acts 13:52, you know, it says that the disciples were filled WITH JOY AND WITH THE Holy Ghost. THEY REJECTED BUT ARE FILLED WITH JOY. OF COURSE, WHEN THEY REJECTED THEM, they they they dust off their dust on their feet. To them, IT WAS A CURSE. BUT THE believers did not go away sad. &gt;&gt; No one is believing our message. They were FILLED WITH JOY. AMEN. AND WITH THE HOLY GHOST, LET ME TELL YOU, BROTHER, EVEN WHEN YOU ARE REJECTED, EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL YOU NOT RECEIVED THAT, PEOPLE WERE SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE YOU. AMEN. AMEN. EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL THINGS ARE NOT WORKING OUT FOR YOU. AMEN. YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS JOY. YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE THE HOLY GHOST BECAUSE HE WILL KEEP YOUR SOUL ON FIRE. &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE SONG WHICH SAYS, "THIS JOY THAT I HAVE, THE DEVIL NEVER GAVE IT TO ME. THIS JOY THAT I HAVE, THE DEVIL NEVER GAVE IT TO ME AND THE DEVIL CANNOT TAKE IT AWAY." COME ON CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY WHENEVER WE COME HERE AND WE ARE PREACHING THE WORD OR WE ARE SINGING OR WE ARE IN CHURCH, WE ARE ALWAYS HAPPY. AND THERE IS ANOTHER SONG WHICH SAYS, "OH, WHEN I GET HAPPY, I SING AND I SHOUT. THE DEVIL DOESN'T BELIEVE IT. I SING. WHY? I'M FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AND THAT IS WHAT THE MATTER WITH ME. THIS IS LIKE HEAVEN TO ME. I'VE CROSSED FROM JORDAN TO CAN LAND. LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE WORD AND GOD FILLED YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST, YOU ARE ALWAYS HAPPY. YOU YOU ALWAYS HAVE JOY. BY THE WAY, JOY IS DIFFERENT FROM HAPPINESS. Oh my God. You may not be happy. YOU MAY BE SAD, BUT YOU HAVE THIS JOY IN YOUR HEART. OH MY MY MY MY MAY GOD REVEAL IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. YOU KNOW, HAVE YOU EVER FELT IT WHEN THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL? WHEN YOU ARE CONFUSED, WHEN YOU HAVE LOSSES, WHEN YOU HAVE REJECTIONS, WHEN YOU HAVE SADNESS, BUT SOMEHOW YOU HAVE A JOY YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND. WHERE DOES IT COME FROM? IT DOESN'T COME FROM THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. IT DOESN'T COME FROM MONEY. IT DOESN'T COME FROM FRIENDS. IT DOESN'T COME FROM ANYTHING. IT COMES FROM CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. THAT JOY WE HAVE RECEIVED WHEN WE RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. SO I TELL YOU BROTHER, SISTER, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE JOYFUL. NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH, WHEN YOU HAVE LITTLE SALARY, BE JOYFUL. WHEN YOU HAVE NO JOB, BE SINGING, DON'T SING AS IF YOU WANT A FUNERAL. THIS IS NOT A FUNERAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is A LABOR WORD. WHERE THERE SHOULD BE CRIES AND SHOUTING AND JOY. DID YOU realize the devil had all but silence? YOU GET THE POINT? IN THE LABOR WORLD, YOU WILL HAVE JOY. YOU WILL HAVE SHOUTING. YOU WILL HAVE GROANINGS. YOU WOULD HAVE CRYING. YOU WOULD HAVE ALL THE THINGS AND CLAPPING THE HANDS AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW STOMPING THE FEET AND AND ALL THE CONFUSIONS AND FALLING DOWN AND YOU KNOW BUT SILENCE HAS NO PLACE THERE. SILENCE IS IN ANOTHER PART OF THE HOSPITAL. SILENCE IS ALWAYS IN A MURERY. WHY? BECAUSE THERE IS NO LIFE. AMEN. EVEN THEY TELL YOU THEY PUT A POST WHATEVER IT IS. PLEASE RESPECT THAT DAY. SO EVERYBODY THAT WALKS IN THERE, YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR A NEEDLE FALLING. WHY? THERE IS DEAD SILENCE. IT MEANS THERE'S NO LIGHT. BROTHER, WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WRONG OR BAD OR WHATEVER, BEGIN SINGING. DON'T BE SILENT. THAT'S WHY I LOVE THAT SONG. I WILL NOT BE SILENT. I WILL ALWAYS WORSHIP YOU. IN GOOD TIMES, I WILL WORSHIP YOU. IN BAD TIMES, I WILL WORSHIP YOU. WHEN I'M HAPPY, I WILL WORSHIP YOU. SOMETIMES I WILL SING SONGS. AMEN. THAT WILL MAKE ME WORSHIP HIM. OTHER TIMES I WILL SING SONGS THAT WILL MAKE ME JUMP AND DANCE. BUT I WILL SING. Sometimes I WILL SING A GROANING SONG. SOMETIMES I WOULD SING A BABLING SONG. SOMETIMES I WILL SING. YOU YOU DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION I AM IN. IT DEPENDS HOW I'M FEELING. WHEN I HEAR OF A TESTIMONY OF A MIRACLE, I WILL SING GLORY, GLORY, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. WHEN I HEAR OF A TEST OF A BAD TESTIMONY OF A LOSS, I WILL SAY MUST JESUS BEAR DISGRACE ALONE. BUT I WILL SING THERE. NEVER BE SILENT. BROTHER EVEN WHEN YOU THINK THE DEVIL HAS GOT YOU SOMEWHERE brother sing. YOU KNOW WE HAVE SONGS FOR EVERY SITUATION. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SONG FOR YOUR SITUATION, MAKE ONE BECAUSE ALL THE SONGS WE SING, THERE WAS SOMEONE IN A SITUATION AND THEY CAME OUT OF THE B AND BEGAN SINGING A SONG. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I MUST TELL JESUS. I MUST TELL JESUS. I CANNOT BEAR MY TROULES ALONE. IN MY DISTRESS, he will kindly help me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, if you're in distress, sing that one. BUT AGAIN, SOMETHING GETS TO HAPPEN TO YOU. WELL, I HAVE JOY JOY JOY. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE GOD HAS DONE SOMETHING FOR ME. HE HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME. AND I CANNOT TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SING THAT WHEN YOU ARE SAD. BUT WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY AND A MESSAGE COMES through &gt;&gt; and you know they have given you your prayer request maybe an upgrade or maybe something is approved or maybe you had a testimony sister saying she got a job she always dreamt for you know I don't think sister Shamina Shina is now singing You must tell Jesus. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO. I I I THINK SHE HAS A NEW SONG. WHICH SONG DO YOU THINK she's singing? &gt;&gt; OH YES. VICTORY IS MINE. VICTORY IS MINE. WHY? YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SING THAT SONG WHEN YOU ARE SAD. Imagine victory is mine. Victory is mine. &gt;&gt; No, someone say, "What's wrong with you?" &gt;&gt; But you know, SHE'S SING A SONG BUBBLING WITH SO MUCH JOY BECAUSE OF WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE. HE HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME. I CANNOT TELL IT ALL. I cannot TELL IT ALL. I CANNOT TELL IT ALL. BUT EVEN WHEN YOU SING A SAD SONG, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE PUTTING THE DEVIL ON NOTICE. SATAN, I'M COMING SOON. I'M COMING FOR YOU. I'M COMING TO GET YOU AFTER I'M DONE WITH HIS SONG. THE BIBLE SAYS HE GIVES ME A NEW SONG. I HAVE A NEW SONG TO SING. I CAN ONLY ALWAYS SING THIS ONE SONG. GOD ALWAYS GIVES YOU A NEW SONG. BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST BECAUSE IF you you're filled with joy and the Holy Ghost, you cannot accept the devil to cast you down. PRAISE GOD. SO NOW 1 TIMOTHY 4, THE BIBLE SAYS um um vers one, now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter days shall some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrine of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, HAVING THEIR CONSCIENCE THEIR CONSCIENCE SEE IT with a hot iron. forbidding to marry. Amen. Brother Julius, they're telling you to be a priest. WHO SHOULD NOT MARRY? WHAT WOULD sister faith have done? You can imagine and commanding TO ABSTAIN FROM MEATS. DON'T EAT PORK. Don't eat this. After this service, if there is something you don't eat because when you eat, you get sick. I'm going to set you free. Go and eat it. GOD HAS CREATED IT TO BE RECEIVED WITH THANKSGIVING OF THEM WHICH BELIEVE, NOT TO EVERYBODY, TO THEM WHICH BELIEVE. AND KNOW THE TRUTH. FOR EVERY CREATURE OF GOD IS GOOD and nothing to BE REFUSED. AMEN. AMEN. FOR IF IT BE RECEIVED WITH THANKSGIVING FOR IT IS SANCTIFIED BY THE WORD OF GOD and prayer. Because remember, you know, it's all about the mind. If your mind is not pure, you will think something is evil, SOMETHING IS HOLY. THERE'S NOTHING EVIL AND THERE'S NOTHING HOLY. IT'S ONLY A HOLY GOD. AND IF THAT HOLY GOD IS IN YOUR HEART, HE WILL ALWAYS LEAD YOU TO ALL TRUTH. DO YOU KNOW EVEN WHEN YOU GO TO THE MARKET HE WILL TELL YOU DON'T BUY THIS CLOTHES but what do you do you send a picture send to YOUR FRIEND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS DRESS it's good you buy you are led by man and by feelings and by your mind it's not the MIND OF CHRIST LET US LEARN TO ASK THE HOLY GHOST. Imagine you brother buying a a a VERY BIG JUMP OR JACKET OR SHIRT that has blasphemous word to IT or blasphemous images. When you read it, you automatically feel the chills of the devil over YOU and you go and buy it. YOU ARE NOT LED BY THE HOLY GHOST. YOU MUST BE LED BY THE HOLY Ghost on all these things. You see, YOUR MIND MUST BE CENTERED on Christ. NOT ON PEOPLE. THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE, PEOPLE'S MINDS ARE ON PEOPLE. WE you you should always come as an individual to God. The Bible SAYS WHEN YOU COME TO GOD, YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT HE IS AND HE IS A REWARDER OF THEM THAT DILIGENTLY SEEK HIM. HOW ARE YOU SEEKING HIM? YOU KNOW LIKE DAVID SANG YOU SEE AS A AS A DEER PANTTH AFTER THE WATERS SO DOES MY SOUL LONG AFTER YOU KNOW HE WAS LONGING FOR WATER. HE WAS LONGING FOR THE HOLY GHOST. HE WAS LONGING FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. YOUR MIND MUST BE CENTERED ON HIM AND HIM ALONE. DON'T LOOK AT YOUR BROTHER. DON'T LOOK AT YOUR SISTER. MAYBE THEY ARE WEAK. MAYBE THEY'RE YOUNGER BELIEVERS. MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. LOOK AT HIM. HIM THAT DIED FOR YOU. AND ALWAYS ENSURE YOU PLEASE HIM. HOW DO YOU PLEASE HIM? BY HAVING FAITH. THE BIBLE SAYS WITHOUT FAITH. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE HIM. AND HOW DO YOU HAVE FAITH? YOU HAVE FAITH. BY HEARING THE WORD. BY HEARING THE WORD, YOU RECEIVE THE WORD AND THEN HE REVEALS to you what to do. Paul sorting the believers and actually asking them to keep their mind centered on Christ. WHO IS CHRIST? CHRIST IS THE WORD. NOT LEGALISM, &gt;&gt; NOT A SET OF RULES. The word is a thought of God expressed. Let me first pause there a moment. I have seen for a long time. It's different here at DV because we have a mixed crowd. Some believe from here. Others came from other churches and the churches you came from, you know, approached the word differently. Each of them, not to say they're preaching wrong, but I'm talking about the approach of a little bit leaning towards a direction. And so then, you know, then we get this mixed and differences in Ethiopia. where we had the grace and opportunity to start from scratch. We would have a church and a place which was just a Bible church and we would have an opportunity to invite young people to invite older ones alike. Told everybody invite your friends come. Let me tell you they came with lipstick. They came with earrings. They came with painted nails. They came with long pants. The women, the boys, the shorts. Are you getting my point? They came. But right now, there's no one the way they were. Some left as they were hearing the word. This is not mine. They go back. And then Paul says, THEY WENT OUT FROM US BECAUSE they not a part of us. If they were a part of us, THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED. HOW DO YOU KNOW THE SEED OF GOD AND THE ONE WHO IS NOT? How do you know your word and the one which you never said? People speak words and they forget. But I don't believe they forget. You can never forget your words. I'm going to prove it in a moment. I don't remember I said that. Did I? No, you are lying. Be sincere because me, I may not remember that I said it like this. Like this. But if you say it the way I said it, I will remember. Because my word and I are not two different people. Let me let me prove it. I know brother um Samuel here. &gt;&gt; I know him and I know brother Julius. Now in the evening that that brother Shalom comes to me and tells me that brother Samuel said ABCD and brother Julia SAID ABCD AND I know them. I know how they talk. I will not accept because I know them. I forget ABOUT YOU &gt;&gt; SO AND SO TO SAY LIKE THAT you are lying &gt;&gt; but there are certain words that they may say so and so say this you will say for sure that I don't even need to ask I know I know that person who talks like that you understand because the words of a person are his thoughts EXPERIENCE each of us here has a WAY THEY THINK THE WAY YOU THINK IS NOT THE WAY I THINK. THE WAY YOU THINK is not the way I think. And that makes you you. It makes me me. The way we think is different. We are made different to accomplish a different purpose. Praise God. SO NOW GOD IN THE SAME WAY. YOU SEE WHEN I say the word or CHRIST IS THE WORD. THE WORD IS A THOUGHT OF GOD. BEFORE IT IS A WORD, IT IS A PART OF GOD. AND NOW GOD EXPRESSES. AMEN. SO THE WORD IS A THOUGHT OF GOD EXPRESSED. BEFORE IT CAN BE A WORD, IT MUST BE A PART OF GOD'S FAITH. THAT'S WHY HE SAID IN JOHN 1:1, "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD." HOW WAS IT WITH GOD? IT WAS WITH GOD AS A THOUGHT. IT WAS WITH HIM AS AN ATTRIBUTE. IT WAS WITH HIM AS A PART OF HIM. AND THEN IN VERSE 14, HE SAYS, "AND THE WORD WAS MADE MANIFEST IN FLESH." SO THE WORD THAT WAS WITH GOD AS A PART OF GOD, AS AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD, WAS NOW SPOKEN INTO MANIFESTATION. AMEN. AMEN. WHEN THE ANGEL CAME DOWN TO MARY, HE SAID, "I SHALL HAVE A SON." HE SAID, "HOW SHALL THESE THINGS BE?" HE SAYS, "THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST WILL OVERTAKE YOU, WILL OVERSHADOW YOU, AND YOU WILL HAVE A SON." SHE SAID, "BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO YOU. BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO THY WORD." AND AS SOON AS SHE SAID THAT, &gt;&gt; SHE BECAME PREGNANT. AMEN. SHE WAS PREGNANTED BY THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GETTING IT? MARY WAS A VIRGIN, &gt;&gt; BUT SHE WAS PREGNANTED BY THE WORD. NOW, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. AMEN. YOU MAY BE VIRGIN TO THE WORD. AND DEFILED BY THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; You may be virgin to the word but defiled by the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD CAN DEFILE YOU. &gt;&gt; NO. ENTER INTO what I'm saying, the spirit of what I'm saying, my brother, or else I tell you to sit down in A MOMENT. LISTEN. DON'T be defiled by the world. &gt;&gt; But many times we are defiled by the world. SO YOU CAN BE DEFILED BY THE wire and virgin TO THE WORD. YOU DON'T KNOW THE WORD. YOU ARE NOT CHANGED. YOU DRESS THE WAY YOU DRESS. YOU TALK THE WAY YOU TALK. YOU BEHAVE THE WAY YOU YOU BEHAVE. BUT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT HOW YOU BEHAVE. OUR MIND IS PURE. AMEN. AND YOUR MIND AS A BELIEVER SHOULD ALWAYS BE PURE ABOUT NEW PEOPLE THAT COME IN. BE PURE ABOUT THEM. BE PURE ABOUT THEM. I SAID BE PURE ABOUT THEM. LET THE LOVE OF JESUS OUT OF YOUR HEART. EMBRACE THEM. AMEN. AND SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN. LET THEM SIT UNDER THE PREACHING OF THE WORD. AMEN. IF THEY ARE A SEED OF GOD, YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE AND BRING FORTH A SON. &gt;&gt; A WHAT? A virgin. WHICH VIRGIN? WE DON'T KNOW. But there MUST BE A VIRGIN. SO WE DON'T KNOW. HOW ARE WE GOING TO KNOW? THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT PARTICULAR VIRGIN THAT WE RECOGNIZE WHEN THE WORD COMES AND WE RECEIVE IT. PERHAPS IN THE DAYS OF OF THAT TIME THERE WERE OTHER VIRGINS prepared by the church that they are going to be pregnant by the world because they thought God ONLY COME THROUGH THEM. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, even today we have denominations who have thought for a long time that they are the ones the word of God come through. They thought they speak on behalf of God. They they think they thought that they were speaking on behalf of God. But God, oh I pray that God gives you this revelation. But God left them long ago. The Pharisees and they said, "You see, sister, they thought God was going to use them to fulfill that scripture." So you know they were the keepers of the law for a long time. So who do you think God was going to use to fulfill the law? They thought of course us. How can God bypass our but God had left them? Oh, let me say something RIGHT HERE. TODAY, GOD IS no longer IN THE DENOMINATIONS. GOD IS NO LONGER in the big denominations. Are you hearing me? Oh, you are not getting it yet. But don't worry, you're going to get IT IN A MOMENT. GOD HAS COME DOWN THROUGH AN ANGEL MESSENGER IN OUR GENERATION AND HE HAS SPOKEN HIS WORD. AND HE HAS SPOKEN HIS WORD. THE ANGEL CAME DOWN, ANGEL GABRIEL, AND GOD BYPASSED THE BIG DENOMINATIONS AND HE SPOKE TO THIS LITTLE WOMAN WHO WAS DESPISED AND SHE SAID, "Be it unto me ACCORDING TO THY WORD." WHY DID THE ANGEL COME TO HER? BECAUSE SHE WAS PREDESTINATED TO BE THE ONE THAT WILL FULFILL THAT SCRIPTURE. SHE WAS PREDESTINATED TO BE CONFORMED TO THE image which she was supposed to be in at the moment, nine months pregnant of the God of heaven and earth. Try to run it through your mind. Does your mind understand it? &gt;&gt; God of heaven and earth in a womb of a younger girl, 9 months down. And then she started pushing. Who is she pushing? God. How does she receive him? By accepting the word. How does she manifest him? By receiving that word, she begins to push out. Push out. Push out. She can't give birth to any other character or nature. But God himself now that is history. But let me come down here. We have received a word by an angel. God has come in our generation and spoken to us my brother. MALACHI, IF you don't know what I'm talking about, Malachi 4. MALACHI 4, &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, I send you a legend, &gt;&gt; AND HE SHALL TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS OF THE CHILDREN AND THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN TO THE FATHER. I WANT TO SAY to you, CHURCH, ELIJAH IS COME. TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, ELIJAH IS COME. ELIJAH IS COME. ELIJAH IS COME. WHO IS THIS ELIJAH? THE THE ANGEL THAT GOD PROMISED YOU WOULD SAY IS THE SEVENTH ANGEL. HIS MESSAGE WOULD DO WHAT? HIS MESSAGE WOULD BATH THE WORD IN US. UNDERSTAND THIS ANGEL GABRIEL HIS MESSAGE BIRTH THE WORD IN MARY. AMEN. GOD HAS SENT A PROPHET MESSENGER IN OUR GENERATION. HE CAME TO BRING US BACK TO THE WORD, BACK TO THE ABSOLUTE, BACK TO SHALOM. SHALOM. AMEN. WE ARE BACK TO THE PEACE OF GOD THAT PASSES ALL WE UNDERSTAND. I TELL YOU SAINTS, WHAT WE HAVE HAD IN OUR GENERATION IS THUS SAYETH THE LORD. WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE. AMEN. WHEN I WAS IN CANADA, I HAVE MET A GROUP OF THEM. I WAS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. I MET A GROUP OF THEM. THEY ARE ALL OVER THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. IS SOMEONE CATCHING THIS REVELATION? THEY ARE ALL OVER THIS WORLD AND THEY HAVE HEARD THIS MESSAGE AND THEY BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. WHAT IS IT? CHRIST. THE WORD IS B INTO THEIR LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Our mind should be stayed on Christ. &gt;&gt; Quit seeing this one, that one, this one, that one. Start seeing Christ. But you see, before it was a word, it was a part of God. I feel that some of us are not getting it. It was a part of God. So when the spirit of God comes in you by the word of God, you it don't doesn't stop there. You begin to birth out. Begin to birth. It's not easy. Bathing is not easy. Those who have ever given birth, you know what I'm talking about. The toothache can make you shout. &gt;&gt; What about the birth pains? It's not easy. &gt;&gt; Push. Push. Pushing a baby. That's what we are doing. Friends, it's not easy when you receive the word. You know, he says it was sweet in my mouth, but when it gone down to my belly, give me Revelation 7 at 10. Hallelujah. Got into my belly, which was bitter. Why? Because you have to birth it. You have to manifest that Christ OF THE WORD. And that's the hard part. Every day you push out. You have to be like Jesus. Pray to die. You think it is easy. All bad maners have to die. Fnication. There are some people are pushing fornication. What are you doing? YOU ARE MANIF THAT LIFE THAT CAME IN YOU BY THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD. IT MUST COME OUT. And I took the little BOOK OUT OF THE ANGEL'S HAND and ate it up. What is the book? Remember the book is a book of redemption. AMEN. REMEMBER THIS BOOK. I TOLD YOU IT HAS YOUR IDENTITY. REVELATION 10:7, HE SAYS, "IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL, WHEN THIS ANGEL BEGINS TO SOUND," AMEN. THE MYSTERY OF GOD WOULD BE FURNISHED. AND I TOLD YOU WHAT THIS MYSTERY IS. AMEN. IS CHRIST BEING REVEALED THROUGH THE BRIDE, THE BODY OF BELIEVERS. AFTER WE HAVE KNOWN HIM AS DEITY, IT DOESN'T STOP WITH JESUS. HE COMES DOWN TO THE BODY TO THE CHURCH. AMEN. WHEN HE COMES DOWN, THEN HE SAYS, you know, now the church gets to know who she is and what she stands for. THEN SHE BECOMES AN ARMY WHICH THE DEVIL CANNOT DEFEAT. YOU BECOME AN ARMY. YOU BECOME AN ARMY WHICH THE DEVIL CANNOT DEFEAT. WHY IS THE DEVIL DEFEATING ME OF YOU IN your mind? &gt;&gt; SAYS I'M RUNNING CRAZY. I'M LOSING MY MIND. WHY, BROTHER? LET CHRIST COME IN YOUR MIND. HE WILL GIVE YOU A PEACE THAT PASSES ALL THAT YOU UNDERSTAND. AMEN. And when he comes IN YOUR HEART, YOU KNOW WHAT? You know who you are. I'm a son OF GOD. I'M A SON OF GOD. I MUST BRING FORTH THE LIFE OF CHRIST. HIS NATURE, HIS ABILITY MUST COME OUT OF ME. I HAVE A RIVER OF LIFE FLOWING OUT OF ME. I HAVE A RIVER OF LIFE. IT BECOMES AS A revelation to a lesson. the things you're struggling with, it comes to a time. As you push out, you know, pain is there for as long as you giving birth, but when you are done, you don't remember it no more. You Oh, see. That's why he says we don't know how we shall be but when he comes we &gt;&gt; shall be like him. &gt;&gt; What happened? WE JUST BIRTHED HIM. WE BECAME HIM. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND I TOOK THE LITTLE BOOK. REMEMBER THE BOOK WAS CLOSED. AMEN. BUT NOW THE BOOK IS OPEN. WHY? BECAUSE THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH PREVAILED. WHAT IS THE LIE OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH? WE FOUND OUT THAT GOD HIDING HIMSELF IN SIMPLICITY. HE CAME BY THE WAY OF THE LAMB. THE LAMB AS SLAIN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD AND HAD PREVAILED to take the book. He died for you, for me. We are the purchase of his blood. We are the PURCHASE OF HIS BLOOD. AND NOW YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO be like him. So when when if we are the purchase of his blood, which one is more important? The blood or you? The blood is the cost is the PRICE is the price to pay for what is going to be redeemed. So you are the redeemed. You are not the blood but you are the redeemed. So which one is more important? If you have 1 MILLION AND SOMEONE tells you to buy my house, you need to give ME 2 MILLION. You will look for it and you will waste it. Throw it away. Give it to them. Say, I don't want my money. I want my house. My house is more valued than the money. In other words, THE BLOOD WAS GIVEN TO PURCHASE YOU TO PURCHASE ME. AMEN. WHICH MEANS I AM THE VALUE OF THE BLOOD. WITHOUT ME THERE IS NO VALUE FOR THE BLOOD. WITHOUT ME BLOOD because I was VAL AND GIVE OUT HIS BLOOD THAT HE MAY REDEEM ME THAT I AM THE REDEEMED. I AM THE REDEEMED WHICH MEANS I AM THE POWER OF THE BLOOD. HOW CAN I BE LOST? &gt;&gt; Think about it. And that's why he says well now after the book has been opened everything that was Adam and Adam himself and everything that was his that had fallen was now redeemed. brought back again. Do you know why? Because it has always been a part of God. We were we were at the thought of God. You see now why we are the we are the um the u the value of the blood. because we were a part of him. &gt;&gt; Maybe for you to understand it, it's like if you lose your hand, what would you do to get it back? What would you do? Tell me. Would you be willing to do anything if you can get back the hand? God was willing to do anything to get you back. Hallelujah. He wasn't buying you a new. He was bringing you back because you have always been a part of you. And now after knowing who you are, now he says take the book. You've received the revelation, but you need to go through the process. &gt;&gt; Eat the book. I took the book and I ate and I ate the book and it was my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And then he says, "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy unto many pe uh before again before man, many peoples and nations and tongues and kings. Praise God. We must birth this life." When we prophesy again, what does it mean? We're going to speak again the word. Cuz remember our mind after we are redeemed and his mind is the same. Hallelujah. So now whatever we see in ourselves that's not of God. It has to go. It has to go. But you see it cannot go without the power of creation. And the power of creation is now in us. So we have to prophesy. So we have to speak again like it was in the beginning when God said let there be. SO WE BEGIN SPEAKING. AMEN. AND that's the groaning. That that's the bitterness cuz you have to die. Unless something be born again before it can be word. It has to be a part of God. In s we would see Jesus. You say there is nothing wrong. Everything is going to turn out all right. Don't be scared. Tell that to your friend. Don't be scared. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's big time piece is sticking right along. It will have a church without spot wrinkle. IT WAS HIS THINKING. THE THING OF IT IS, AM I IN THERE? ARE YOU IN THERE in his thinking? Are you want to SAY YES I AM? &gt;&gt; YES I AM. AND HERE HE WAS ETERNAL THOUGHTS OF GOD EXPRESSED INTO SUNSHIP. OH MY. THERE WAS GOD EMMANUEL. NOTICE THAT HE HE WAS THE WORD. You see, don't let anyone spoil you after anything. Philosophy, vanty, tradition of men, rootments of the world, not after Christ. Christ is the image of the invisible God. The firstborn of every creature. God powered himself in Christ. Christ powered himself where? You know, sometimes when I preach or when people preach, we think we preach so hard. &gt;&gt; And sometimes as a preacher, you wonder, are the people getting it? But I tell you what, we we don't get it by our five senses. We get it by the sixth sense. And you don't know you have it until you are in danger. Some of you don't know you can fly until a lion comes to you. That's when you realize you can actually fly. What happened? You had it in you. But if someone tell you hey jump I have no strength. But let the lion come. You will not even know where the power the strength and everything comes from. You will not only jump. You will fly. I don't even know how I I but I found myself outside. It is in you. So the word is actually being formed in you. Give me 10 minutes. I'll finish. SO GOD POWERED HIMSELF in Christ. Christ powered himself in us. SO WE TODAY WE ARE THE EXPRESS IMAGE of Christ on earth. Christ wants to be all in all. to live our life. You know is not no longer our life but he wants to live his life in us through us. listen to this. The indictment HE SAYS THE HOLY GHOST TODAY, today not yesterday, today is not the third person. It is God himself manifested in human flesh. The Holy Ghost is he himself manifested in human flesh by what? The blood of Jesus to sanctify A LIFE THAT HE MIGHT REFLECT himself through. AMEN. I AM THE REFLECTION OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THEY AND THEY CRUCIFY THAT SAME WORD MADE MANIFEST AND THEY ARE CRUCIFYING THAT SAME WORD MADE FRESH TODAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Now listen when when when God was made manifest. &gt;&gt; If you get it, say amen. That means this. &gt;&gt; Brother Joseph, are you getting it? When God was made manifest in Christ, they did what? To him? They crucified him. They did not know. They were crucifying the word man. AND NOW WHEN THE WORK TODAY IS GOD HIMSELF MANIFESTED IN human flesh by the blood of JESUS CHRIST TO SANCTIFY A life that he might reflect himself THROUGH that's me. If you are the one just say that's me. Amen. He wants to manifest his life oh God through me. and they crucify that same word made man. You find people crucifying you for believing what you believe, for refusing their ways, for doing WHAT YOU DO. THEY DON'T KNOW BUT THEY ARE CRUCIFYING THAT CHRIST. The crucifixion of Christ today is the people who will deny the vindicated and manifested son of God among the people. his things that he said he would take place in this day by his word. Have you ever heard of this song? We are the word made flesh today. Give me the song if you have it. Some of these things we sing it but we don't understand it. Brothers and sisters, we need to come to maturity. &gt;&gt; Many believers are still living in the in the realms of legalism. The message is not that come up higher. We are the word made flesh today. This is what the scripture said and our names are seen within in the book redeemed and perfect without sin. We are anointed and inspired by our God who is the original life redeemed. I've already talked about that. Perfect. HEY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT SIN? Do you EVEN GET IT? THEY THAT ARE BORN OF GOD CANNOT SIN. SO I AM REDEEMED. I AM PERFECT. I AM THE WORD MADE FLESH TODAY. I AM THE REDEEMED OF THE LORD. AMEN. I AM INSPIRED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But if you say to the person, you say, "What are you talking about?" Are you making yourself God? &gt;&gt; Don't you know that I'm a part of God? Don't you know that the bride is a part of him? Don't you know he's the head, WE ARE THE BODY. SO WE ARE HIM. M &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THEY REJECT YOUR LIFE, they reject Christ. It's not I'm don't not talking about the WORKS OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WORK OF CHRIST THROUGH YOU. AND THEY SAY she's pretending. He's pretending. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS CHRIST IN YOU. AND THEY ARE PERSECUTING HIM. THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL HIM. THEY'RE TALKING AGAINST HIM. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD NOT SEE ANY EVIL, NOT THINK ANY EVIL, NOT SAY ANY EVIL. WHY? BECAUSE THAT IS A BROTHER, IS A SISTER, IS A WORD MADE FLESH TODAY. EVEN THE MYSTERY WHICH HAS BEEN HID FROM AGES AND GENERATIONS, BUT NOW, TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, BUT NOW. &gt;&gt; BUT NOW, NOT YESTERDAY. OH, HALLELUJAH. BUT NOW IS MADE WHAT? &gt;&gt; Manifest unveiled. To who? To everyone? To who? To his saints. to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery. Christ in you. Now there is a part you have not seen before. You have always read it but I want you to see it and it will blow your mind. What do we preach? We preach the word. But remember I said after you eat the book, prophesy again, speak the word. Why? Because we are preaching the word. It's the word that gives life. The word is a thought of God. Is a thought before it is the word. And then is expressed. But then here he says to whom he says to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery. among the Gentiles, which is which is Christ. &gt;&gt; Come on, say it. &gt;&gt; I want to say those ones with revelation. Say it. &gt;&gt; What? Say it again. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; GOD BLESS YOU. NOT CHRIST IN YOU, BUT CHRIST IN ME. THE HOPE OF GLORY. &gt;&gt; SO IN OTHER WORDS, THIS CHRIST IS THE MYSTERY WHICH WAS HID FROM AGES AND GENERATIONS. THIS CHRIST, BUT WHERE IS HE? &gt;&gt; IN ME. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. H LOOK AT THIS. TO WHOM? &gt;&gt; TO WHOM &gt;&gt; WHOM WE PREACH. NO, NO. VERSES 28, WHOM WE PREACH, WARNING EVERY MAN, TEACHING EVERY MAN IN ALL WISDOM, THAT WE MAY PRESENT EVERY MAN perfect in this Christ Jesus. SO WHO DO WE PREACH? WE PREACH CHRIST. HE'S THE WORD. BUT WHERE IS HE? HE'S IN ME. SO WHO AM I PREACHING? I'M PREACHING CHRIST. I AM NOT JUST PREACHING, BROTHER. I AM SPEAKING THE WORD. &gt;&gt; OH HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU AND I ARE LIVING THE LIFE OF THE WORD BY LIVING THE LIFE OF THE WORD IN US. We are manifesting Christ. We are preaching Christ. But the bam says instead of preaching someone leave me one. There are many people. Oh yes, THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE who can preach maybe better than us believers. I can tell YOU THAT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. They can. They're so eloquent. They can talk so well. But there's one area they lack and they can never get is the life. Why? They know how to talk but they have rejected the word of the hour. It's only the bride in this hour that can manifest the life of the world. So don't you worry. Whatever you're going through, the hardships you're finding, the temptations and sin that easily beset you. Keep pushing. Keep pushing. THAT LIFE MUST COME OUT. IT'S LIKE A WOMAN WHO IS PREGNANT. YOU GIVE BIRTH OR YOU DIE. EVEN THOUGH YOU DIE. AMEN. BUT I WANT TO BE like one of those THAT WOULD SAY I CANNOT DIE. I WILL LIVE. AMEN. What am I going to do? I must give BIRTH TO THIS CHILD. I I MUST PUT TO BED. HEY, I MUST BRING FORTH THIS CHILD. I MUST BRING FORTH HIS LIFE. I CANNOT ALLOW THE FEAR TO DESTROY ME. I CANNOT ALLOW LUST TO KILL ME. I CANNOT ALLOW ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE AROUND ME TO DESTROY MY NATURE. I HAVE SOMETHING IN ME. THE LIFE OF JESUS, I MUST B IT. I MUST BRING FORTH THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's the cry of the bride in this hour. And I finish with a quote I started with. And I think a good little thing you ought to set around on your desk. It's a little thing I sat down on in Florida not long ago. It was three little monkeys. Put up that picture, brother. Three little monkeys. One of them had in his hand over his eyes and they said, "See no evil." And the other one had in his fingers, in his ears, he said, "No evil. Hear no evil." And the other one had in his hand over his mouth, he said, "Speak no evil. And then brother Bam CONTINUES AND SAYS JUST KEEP YOUR MIND PURE ON CHRIST. KEEP YOUR MIND PURE ON CHRIST. WHERE IS HE? HE'S IN YOUR BROTHER. HE'S IN YOUR SISTER. AMEN. I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS YOU ARE SEEING IN AROUND ME. &gt;&gt; NO BROTHER, I DIDN'T SAY THAT. THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU ARE SEEING AROUND ME. THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU ARE SEEING AROUND LANGA. THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU ARE SEEING AROUND YOUR BROTHER. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT DEFINES THEM. THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THIS FLESH. THEY ARE IN THIS HOUSE. BUT I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU THIS MORNING. THIS HOUSE OF GRACE ONE DAY IS GOING TO BUST WIDE OPEN. AMEN. AND THE REAL WILL COME. AMEN. AND WILL COME IN A REAL BODY IN THE THEOPHONY. AMEN. THAT'S WHY WHEN I HEAR THE WORD CONNECT, CONNECTION, CONNECT, CONNECTION, CONNECT. HOW MANY ARE FEELING THE CONNECTION? AMEN. HALLELUJAH. YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY YOUR TRIALS. You are not defined by your weaknesses. Can I come down to you? You are not defined by your weakness. The thing that makes you want to lose your mind is not what defines you. You remember the thing you said you went and pray God if you don't take this AWAY stop praying like that because it's not God to take it away. It is you to birth that life. So what is your work? Keep eating the word. The more you eat the word, the more life comes out. The more life comes out. And one of these days, friends, we are going to manifest that life in fullness, in completeness and in joy. And now he says, just keep your mind pure on Christ. You can't just say well now see if you don't watch well you will get yourself over into a place if you can't keep on thinking that I don't think that you have you you can't leave so perfect till you don't make that mistake now now don't you think you will ever get that way cuz you won't no sir you are not sinless and you will suddenly get off on their track on this side and on that side what he's saying is that we are not going to live perfect in the sense that we are not going to make mistakes We will make those mistakes. But you see, that doesn't define you. Keep your eyes and your mind on Christ. But a man that's once knocked down, if he's a real soldier, He will rise up again. Lord, let me rise and try it again. But a coward as soon as he sees he makes his first little mistake. Just like I said this morning, the bug in the in the water spider will crawl right back in the water again. so refuse all the old prophet bubbling and carrying on and talking. Bubbling means confusion. The Bible said mark those who cause contentions among you. Brother, give me that picture if you have it that I I shared with you. the other picture. Um, if you have it, I want us to just see a little bit about the mind as I as I close. And as he's getting it, he says, "Let me go in your office and you tell me you are a Christian and let me hear you turn on your radio when I'm in there and you are listening to those some kind of old bogy music and let me see that half dressed women and pinups all on the side of your wall. I don't care what you say. I know what your spirit is feeding on. &gt;&gt; You You check it. Check the the DVF media. It should be there. And uh then it says, "And you people that you know here is speaking of the people that uh feed on on stuff cuz I want to show you the the picture on the uh on the mind and um and and on the spirit and body. And uh this is very important friends and maybe if he doesn't get a picture just speak it. You know I want to show you that we have we are we are a triune being. We are soul, body, spirit. And you see in our senses in the body, these are the senses we use to contact the earth. See, hear, feel, taste, smell. But but you know those are the doors through the body that if you open those doors something will come in your spirit which is your mind and many times we see wrong things we hear wrong things we we we we test wrong things and smell and feel wrong things and and and speak wrong things. And when we open those doors, the devil defiles our mind. You may be the best person of the best character, but if someone meets someone and talks them against you, that person or that someone will see you in a different light. Why? Because they open their their hearing and they cannot hear what they have heard. So then their mind, what's the mind? The mind is your memory. You remember everything that you you you had your conscience, your affection, your imagination, your reasoning. This is all your mind is your intelligence. As long as you open those five senses of the body, it comes and affects your mind. And that you find that your mind is not focused on Christ, but it's focused on everything else but Christ. um quote he says, "And you people with these soul blade tempers that's always spouting off in the mouth at somebody. You know, someone just grieves you and you don't have self-control. Some people don't have self-control." Let me tell you, you should always have self-control. Don't answer somebody when you are angry. Be it a husband or wife, daughter, whatever it is, don't answer anybody when you are angry. The Holy Spirit in you should give you self-control that you have heard things and it has made you angry. So you have this TEMPER and you go back, oh, I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have said that. Instead of doing that, always remember when you are angry, the Holy Spirit should give you enough character to stay calm. You feel the devil through the flesh pressuring you. SAY SOMETHING. DO SOMETHING. refuse no &gt;&gt; I will do nothing I will hear nothing I will say nothing I'm put now that's another level of self-control and then when you are calm come back and have a discussion you'll always realize you on top of the can't put up on things like that. If you always have this sole tempers, be careful. You are guilty if you speak a word against your brother. That is not right. That's not just you. go around and tear down. &gt;&gt; You don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him. You can break his character and kill him. You can kill his influence. Speak against your pastor here. Say something about him. you just might as well as shot him, told something that wasn't right about him. &gt;&gt; Well, it will kill his influence with the people and things like that AND YOU ARE GUILTY OF IT. SO, how then should we leave? Don't let temper control you. If you have temper, don't say a word. Give me that picture again. &gt;&gt; I want us to look at it again. Hear no nothing. &gt;&gt; Say no evil. &gt;&gt; Think no evil. &gt;&gt; See Christ in your brother. I CAN'T LOVE THEM. THEY DID THIS TO ME. &gt;&gt; IN THE present water, present ever present water from the rock. It says, "And what we love each other is not because that we are somebody, but it is the Christ in one ANOTHER that we love." Hallelujah. It's the God that is in our beings that we love. Hallelujah. This man has done a lot of bad things to me. But I love him dear. Why? I love Christ in him. Pastor, you mean someone can have Christ in THEM AND DO SOMEBODY STOPPING? Oh yes. Because they still have the flesh. So then you look beyond the flesh. Jesus was God and yet he still wept. He thought he's God. He was sleeping, tired, but yet God, you have Christ in you. But remember that brother is the same. That sister is the same. See Christ in one of you. Turn around. Check your brother, sisters and tell them I love you. Love you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Let us stand on our feet tonight. Amen. Do you know that song which the family of God? Brother Shalom, you know the song. Can you come up and help me sing it? Hallelujah. I don't know. Does somebody know the song? Maybe a sister or something that can help us sing it. You know, we should love one another. &gt;&gt; No matter what, always love your brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. If nobody knows the song, I'll sing another song. Let us sing blessed be the tie that binds. But if you can give us the words of the song. Blessed be the tie that bind our hearts in shine love the fellowship of kindred minds. is like to that above. Oh, we used to sing this song. Very, very wonderful song. Just learn it before our father's throne. our praise. Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one, our comforts and our games. We share our mutual wars, our m and for each other's flows simple. Thinging. Blessed be blessed be that t that binds our hearts in Christian life. My fellowship sheep kind my is to thy aba. Let us sing that one more time. Blessed be blessed be &gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt; that man who shall laugh. The fellow Lord sheep of kind mind is light to that abide. Amen. Never failed me yet. Jesus has never failed me yet. Jesus love and you know that Jesus love is actually in my heart &gt;&gt; for my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us clap our hands and sing this song. Never failed me yet.

We shall Okay, just a moment, brother. I want you to understand what you're singing. Listen, the resurrection morning could be just the next minute. We are going to be changed. Resurrection is talking about a change of life. Amen. And he says this, the death prison BARS SHALL BE BRACKEN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE? Your body, you're going to come out of it and you will rise. Be young forever. Our fathers if you've lost them. Our mothers if you've lost them. Our loved ones, we shall all see them. Apostle Paul and even William Bham our messenger, John, Peter, Luke. We shall see them. We shall rise. I don't have much of a voice, but I feel like singing. So, let's sing it. Amen. We shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise. Amen. We shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise. Amen. In the resurrection morning. Father Shal, help me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We shall in the resurrection morning. What a meeting it will be. Hallelujah. We shall rise.

Is the Lord good to you? &gt;&gt; Has it been good to you, church? Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I just want us to close the service. Before we do, I have to remind you that uh this next coming Saturday is brother Mar's wedding. &gt;&gt; Oh, he can't wait for next Saturday. I I'm sure I did not see you when we were singing the song, but I don't know whether you sang it because you know we always say when a person is going to the wedding said let rapture rapture can wait after my wedding. But we are waiting for the resurrection morning. That's our priority. Praise God. So please um I think brother Martin will come and say a few words perhaps too about the contributions and all that. Uh but I also wanted to say to you, we are doing well as far as our land fund is concerned, but we are not yet there. And I want to thank really from my heart sincerely thank those who have really fulfilled and are fulfilling their commitments. God richly bless you. There's no other way we are going to do this. I tell you the truth. God is going to accomplish this through us. We are people of faith. We expect results. We expect miracles. But we don't want to live by them. We want to live by faith. And if and if by faith faith without works is dead do something or not. If you you know I'm seeing God blessing people simple people with jobs and let me tell you if you're faithful on the work of God he will bless you. I was surprised when I heard her sister. I know she has been working but I know she's one of those faithful givers and you know I was speaking with one of the brothers I think was it in Canada and I think I find it to be true anywhere that sometimes people you expect to give they don't. And sometimes those you expect not to give much, they surprise you. They give a lot and God blesses them in return. It's a program of God. It's not our program. It is a program of God. Let's do it friends. So we need 10 more millions. And by the way, not to mention we used 4 something. How much was it, brother? Someone tell me on the rent. So that 20 is not all there. So but generally I would want to say we need 10 more millions by tomorrow because we need to to pay this gentleman the 30 millions which is the first phase. We need to pay 30 millions four times to be able to now fully occupy our lives. So those are the targets. So if you have pledged and you're not fulfilling, you're putting us behind. Don't wait for the big big blessing. Give the little you can afford every week and God will bless you according accordingly rather. God could not give that widow more oil than the vessel she broke. Right? So God has a lot but the see the principle is you sow and you reap. If you sow sparingly you reap sparingly. I'm not hearing any amen. So let us sow. I'm an example. I truly give and I know many here who also I if I mention names I'll leave out some but those of you have been faithful I want to say God bless your faithfulness and to those of you who sincerely have nothing to give. We pray that God will provide for you, that you will give. And those who maybe feel that they don't have what to give yet they do. May God give you revelation that you may be able to know. God bless you saints. I'll ask you maybe to sit for a minute, but the service is dismissed. meet see you on Wednesday. Pray for me. Potentially I'll be going to West Nile. &gt;&gt; Uh the Lord willing on Tuesday for a few days. We need to meet the pastors there and uh to help them get started with the translation and to try and put a team together to to start that translation. So pray pray pray for that God will give us grace. God bless you all. You can greet one another and tell your brother sister God bless you. God bless you saints. Amen. Good, good, good. I feel good, wonderful, good. &gt;&gt; Sorry. So before you go, sorry. Uh, brother Joseph Good. I feel good. Good. Good. I feel good. Wonderful. Good. Every time I think about Jesus, I feel good. Good. I feel joy. Joy, joy. I feel joy, wonderful joy. Every time I think about Jesus, I feel joy, joy. I feel joy, joy, joy, joy, joy. &gt;&gt; Oh, every time &gt;&gt; I feel joy, &gt;&gt; I feel good. Good. Good. I feel good. &gt;&gt; Yes. Every time I think about Jesus, &gt;&gt; I feel good. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel good, good, good. I feel good, wonderful, good. Every time I think about Jesus, I feel good.
