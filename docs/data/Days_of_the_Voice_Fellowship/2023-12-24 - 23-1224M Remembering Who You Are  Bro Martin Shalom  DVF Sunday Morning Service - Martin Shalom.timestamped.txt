[1:14:04] morning I have a testimony that I want
[1:14:05] to give before uh I go into
[1:14:08] preaching last week I forgot I went
[1:14:12] straight to the word because uh because
[1:14:15] of the
[1:14:16] time uh I remember
[1:14:18] I uh I remember telling you uh giving
[1:14:23] you
[1:14:23] uh the information or the report about
[1:14:26] my journey to the
[1:14:29] east my sister's wedding was last the
[1:14:32] other
[1:14:33] Saturday uh so that night of the after
[1:14:36] the
[1:14:37] wedding uh you know it
[1:14:41] rain and also people were very many so
[1:14:46] it so happened that uh we were caught up
[1:14:49] that
[1:14:50] side by the time you realized it was
[1:14:52] already too late and we did not have uh
[1:14:56] okay they did not have a proper
[1:14:58] arrangement for the transportation of uh
[1:15:01] of of parents so I realized that uh my
[1:15:05] parent were still stuck so I had to
[1:15:08] arrange to
[1:15:10] see how to take them home so we left the
[1:15:14] venue because the venue took place at
[1:15:17] the groom's home so we left at around uh
[1:15:21] it was I think approaching it was
[1:15:22] already the mid
[1:15:24] night so there are two roads that goes
[1:15:27] to our home but the main road had a lot
[1:15:31] of ditches and being that uh it had
[1:15:34] rained so the road was so bad so my
[1:15:37] father told me requested me to take
[1:15:39] another route it's a bit a longer route
[1:15:42] but it was at least was a good route it
[1:15:44] had no dishes so so happened that as we
[1:15:48] were going I was driving them
[1:15:51] home and uh we we reached
[1:15:54] somewhere that place is a little bit
[1:15:58] swampy and if you see it had Rice Garden
[1:16:02] on the either on the both side so it was
[1:16:06] like
[1:16:07] a kind of a swampy place but
[1:16:12] deep so as we
[1:16:16] were okay as I was driving uh I realized
[1:16:20] from afar I saw like it's like I was
[1:16:23] seeing logs on the road so I asked my
[1:16:27] dad that maybe this road is closed so
[1:16:29] what I did I put when I put the full
[1:16:31] light I realized it was like it was a
[1:16:35] roadblock at night it was already
[1:16:37] approaching one something like uh uh it
[1:16:40] was 54 past
[1:16:43] midnight then I saw uh there was
[1:16:45] somebody who was just seated near that
[1:16:48] carod
[1:16:49] block so I first took it easy I said
[1:16:52] maybe
[1:16:57] then I started to reverse so immediately
[1:16:59] after I just engag the reverse gear then
[1:17:02] I saw the man coming toward
[1:17:05] us from nowhere others came from the
[1:17:08] bush like six of them they had pangas
[1:17:12] they had ax they had big logs or big
[1:17:17] sticks so all of them were armed with
[1:17:20] weapon which were not guns you know my
[1:17:23] dad uh he was working with uh police and
[1:17:28] so he told me do you know what those are
[1:17:31] Thugs and guess what we are parked in
[1:17:34] the car we we like eight or nine of
[1:17:39] us so Brethren immediately I felt
[1:17:47] like like the death angel had overed
[1:17:50] over us it was it was like those people
[1:17:54] of nevi where they were told that
[1:17:56] everybody to cry for his
[1:17:58] God blessed be the name of the Lord in
[1:18:02] fact it was so
[1:18:04] scaring and some of even some the things
[1:18:07] which happen in the car which I may not
[1:18:08] tell you but uh I just wondered now how
[1:18:12] we going to go about this we could not
[1:18:14] go
[1:18:16] back and so we just started praying
[1:18:21] because the Bible says that the name of
[1:18:23] the Lord is strong and mighty tower
[1:18:25] where righteous run and also the bible
[1:18:28] say that is a very present hope in time
[1:18:31] of trouble so this guy came others
[1:18:35] putting on jumpers with hood very tough
[1:18:39] very angry and very annoyed they had
[1:18:42] scaring
[1:18:43] continents blessed be the name of the
[1:18:46] Lord H so I thought maybe since my dad
[1:18:49] is maybe will my brother let me tell you
[1:18:54] I learned something in fact I think I
[1:18:58] even I learned a very big
[1:19:00] sermon
[1:19:02] that a security Personnel without gun is
[1:19:09] nobody the big man was so
[1:19:13] quiet because I remember for me I don't
[1:19:16] have any experience even of uh of an
[1:19:18] arrow but we trusted God they started
[1:19:22] asking us very many any question so they
[1:19:24] said they they requested me to come out
[1:19:26] of the car I told them no I cannot get
[1:19:29] out of the car but what I did I locked
[1:19:32] the car and I raised a little bit the
[1:19:36] window and
[1:19:38] honestly I was very sober and
[1:19:42] Vigilant I not even put I don't remember
[1:19:44] putting off the car engine because I
[1:19:47] said if wor comes the wor I will knock
[1:19:50] some whatever happen will happen but
[1:19:53] still I was trusting God because they
[1:19:56] had
[1:19:57] pangas they had
[1:20:00] a they had
[1:20:03] [Music]
[1:20:05] a so finally we were there for some good
[1:20:09] time I think more than 30
[1:20:11] minutes so they asked where are you
[1:20:13] coming from say we from the wedding of
[1:20:15] our daughter where are you going someone
[1:20:17] say he coming from the way and you're
[1:20:18] asking where he's going we are going
[1:20:20] home where is your home
[1:20:23] he told them why are you moving at this
[1:20:25] time as if they the one to determine for
[1:20:29] us so when were there others were
[1:20:32] praying others were scared the prayer
[1:20:35] which they prayed maybe few weeks ago
[1:20:37] was what was standing for
[1:20:39] them uh so they told me when they
[1:20:43] requested me to come out I refused I
[1:20:45] told them
[1:20:46] no and uh they were asking me question
[1:20:50] as I was also asking them question there
[1:20:53] is some how how God gave me boldness and
[1:20:56] maybe I thought that maybe they also
[1:20:59] said but why is
[1:21:01] this this young man Bor like
[1:21:05] this and indeed they also risk because
[1:21:07] if we had guns in our car that would be
[1:21:11] another
[1:21:12] story so finally they went and
[1:21:15] negotiated uh they went and talk to
[1:21:17] themselves then they came back to me and
[1:21:19] they went back
[1:21:21] again so when they came back then they
[1:21:24] asked me for 20,000 Ugandan
[1:21:28] shillings I just knew this battle is
[1:21:32] over and you know what I gave them
[1:21:37] 15,000 I told them I don't have 20 but
[1:21:40] maybe I can I give you what I
[1:21:43] have they never took our phone because I
[1:21:46] realize the magnitude of the problem
[1:21:48] which we had bumped into after we had
[1:21:51] left they would have have taken our phon
[1:21:54] our wallet maybe given us chioko and
[1:21:58] even go with the car but the angel of
[1:22:01] the Lord was
[1:22:04] there God protected us they took nothing
[1:22:08] from us apart from the 15,000 which we
[1:22:11] gave them blessed be the name of the
[1:22:15] Lord so friends our God is
[1:22:19] faithful if it wasn't
[1:22:23] the grace of God it would be another
[1:22:25] story I was there with my mother my
[1:22:29] father my daughter my brother's two
[1:22:33] children my cousin
[1:22:35] sister then my aunt and then a friend to
[1:22:39] our
[1:22:40] mom so that would be another story but I
[1:22:44] thank you for your prayer that's why
[1:22:46] it's always good to pray for one another
[1:22:49] may God bless you so much amen
[1:22:53] amen shall We rise on our
[1:23:00] [Music]
[1:23:05] feet I know people are Waring for

[1:23:11] there and uh we thank God that uh we
[1:23:14] know the prophet tells us that Christmas
[1:23:16] is not a day of Celebration but it's a
[1:23:19] day of
[1:23:20] worship so you are the people who know
[1:23:23] the real Christmas amen precious Lord
[1:23:27] Jesus we come before th throne of grace

[1:33:58] face the pages of this Bible and can
[1:34:01] read maybe because we went to school or

[1:34:56] God

[1:35:02] sons of God and it do not
[1:35:06] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[1:35:10] that when he shall

[1:35:17] see him as he is and every man that has
[1:35:21] this hope in him purifi himself even as
[1:35:25] he is pure
[1:35:28] amen praise the
[1:35:30] Lord where we have read here it tells us
[1:35:33] that
[1:35:35] uh in 1 John
[1:35:38] 3:2 the Bible says that beloved now we
[1:35:41] are sons of
[1:35:44] God now you are sons of God and it do
[1:35:50] not yet
[1:35:52] appear what we shall be but when he when
[1:35:59] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:36:03] shall be like him for he shall see for
[1:36:07] we shall see him as he is nobody is
[1:36:13] going to see the Lord for you you shall
[1:36:16] see him as he is amen
[1:36:22] and this
[1:36:24] morning
[1:36:32] uh we are going
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:38] to we are going to remind ourselves of
[1:36:41] who we are amen because if you don't
[1:36:45] know who you are if you don't
[1:36:48] know where you come like where you came
[1:36:50] from where you are right now and where
[1:36:54] you are
[1:36:55] going then that's where the bible say
[1:36:57] that without
[1:36:58] Vision people perish amen so this
[1:37:02] morning I just want us to remind ourself
[1:37:04] of who we
[1:37:06] are and what I'm what I can tell you
[1:37:09] this morning is that you are the sons of
[1:37:12] God you are the daughters of God Amen we
[1:37:17] are the children of God blessed be the
[1:37:20] name of the the Lord the Bible tells us
[1:37:23] in John 4:
[1:37:26] 24 that God is
[1:37:30] spirit and those who worship him they
[1:37:33] Worship the Lord in spirit and if we are
[1:37:36] the children of God we are supposed to
[1:37:39] worship God in spirit in fact we have
[1:37:42] that element of spiritual being in US
[1:37:45] amen that's why the prophet
[1:37:49] says that without the Holy Spirit we
[1:37:53] have not even begun you have not even
[1:37:55] begun to worship God blessed be the name
[1:37:58] of the Lord and all of us we waiting for
[1:38:01] the Rapture how many wait for Rapture
[1:38:03] here each one of us we know that one of
[1:38:06] these days God is going to take his
[1:38:09] charge but where the secret is the bible
[1:38:12] say that when he comes he will not step
[1:38:14] on
[1:38:15] Earth
[1:38:18] amen those who will be called be when
[1:38:21] they alive they'll be caught up they'll
[1:38:25] fly up to meet Christ in the air blessed
[1:38:28] be the name of the Lord and here where
[1:38:30] we have read in
[1:38:32] Hebrews Hebrews chapter 10: 19-
[1:38:36] 23 it tells us
[1:38:39] something vers 19 it
[1:38:42] says and having there boldness to enter
[1:38:46] into the
[1:38:48] holiest by the blood of
[1:38:52] Jesus without the blood of Jesus we
[1:38:55] cannot have that boldness to come before
[1:38:59] the Lord amen and that's why Jesus
[1:39:04] came because the bible say that for God
[1:39:06] so Lov the world John
[1:39:08] 3:16 that he gave his only begotten for
[1:39:12] what we all know that when man sin in
[1:39:15] the garden of Aiden man lost his
[1:39:18] inheritance Amen in the Bible the
[1:39:20] prophet says that did the title did went
[1:39:23] back to God so man lost his position in
[1:39:26] Eden blessed be the name of the
[1:39:28] Lord and that's why Jesus came to bridge
[1:39:32] that gap between man and God and that's
[1:39:34] why the Bible says that there is no any
[1:39:37] other mediator between man and God L
[1:39:40] Jesus Christ and that's why we Believers
[1:39:44] we don't pray through somebody to speak
[1:39:47] to to
[1:39:48] God Amen because we have an atonement
[1:39:53] and that is the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:39:55] blessed be the name of the Lord and he
[1:39:57] said having therefore Breen bold to
[1:40:00] enter in the Holy in the Holiness by the
[1:40:03] blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way
[1:40:07] amen that is the new and the living
[1:40:13] way the new and the Living Way comes
[1:40:16] through Jesus Christ blessed be the name
[1:40:19] of the Lord
[1:40:21] amen then he
[1:40:26] says and the living way which he hath
[1:40:30] consecrated for us through the veil that
[1:40:34] is to say his
[1:40:37] flesh and having an high
[1:40:40] priest over the house of God you know
[1:40:45] the Bible says Jesus Christ is the high
[1:40:47] priest who is touched by the faing of an
[1:40:49] infirmities
[1:40:51] Jesus knows what you feel even now Jesus
[1:40:56] knows what you're going through Jesus
[1:40:59] knows what is troubling you Jesus knows
[1:41:02] our troubles he knows our cares he knows
[1:41:05] our worries amen he cares for us he
[1:41:09] fights for us blessed be the name of the
[1:41:11] Lord because he is the high priest of
[1:41:14] our confession he is touched by what we
[1:41:19] are going through by what by our
[1:41:22] feelings amen that is what the Bible
[1:41:25] says and that's why most time it doesn't
[1:41:28] matter how you are
[1:41:32] feeling you know the devil
[1:41:36] operates the devil always operates
[1:41:39] through our feelings he comes and
[1:41:42] creates a funny atmosphere around you
[1:41:45] until you
[1:41:49] think
[1:41:52] that is the devil because the devil can
[1:41:54] he can play with your feeling and he
[1:41:57] will still play with it as long as
[1:41:59] you're still in this flesh amen blessed
[1:42:02] be the name of the Lord let us draw near
[1:42:06] with a True Heart in full Assurance of
[1:42:08] Faith having our heart sprinkled from un
[1:42:13] evil conscious and our bodies washed
[1:42:16] with pure water that pure water is not
[1:42:20] like
[1:42:22] Victoria amen but that is the blood of
[1:42:26] Jesus
[1:42:28] Christ there is a song that say that
[1:42:30] water cannot wash away my sin but wash
[1:42:33] me with the blood of the lamb and I be
[1:42:36] white as snow amen so it is the blood of
[1:42:40] Jesus Christ that cleanses us what makes
[1:42:45] the difference between us and den
[1:42:47] domination is not even the way we
[1:42:50] worship
[1:42:51] the way we sing they also sing if you
[1:42:54] get angryan when if you have if you go
[1:42:57] and attend angan anointed worship
[1:43:00] brother I remember when we were still at
[1:43:03] Zana there those they could have there
[1:43:06] overnight and they will start at 7 up to
[1:43:11] 6: a.m. in the morning
[1:43:14] nonstop real worship
[1:43:18] amen blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:43:21] what maketh difference it is the blood
[1:43:23] of Jesus
[1:43:25] Christ and that's why brother sister
[1:43:28] each one of
[1:43:38] us there are
[1:43:40] challenges there are things which
[1:43:42] sometime like for example if you look at
[1:43:46] the most of the preaching if not all of
[1:43:49] the preaching it is put putting emphasis
[1:43:52] on new birth Bap of the Holy Spirit the
[1:43:56] reason as why it's like that because
[1:43:58] without that we have not even become a
[1:44:00] worshiper amen but when we receive the
[1:44:04] spirit of Christ it is him that places
[1:44:08] us in our rightful positions blessed be
[1:44:11] the name of the
[1:44:12] Lord and that's why even the Bible most
[1:44:15] time the Bible tells us you hear where
[1:44:18] we have read in first John tells us now
[1:44:21] we are the children of God he reminding
[1:44:24] us some says you are of God little
[1:44:26] children and greater is he that is in
[1:44:29] you amen John apostle John is reminding
[1:44:33] us amen about who we are we must know
[1:44:39] who we are blessed be the name of the
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:49] Lord
[1:44:54] amen blessed be the name of the Lord the
[1:44:57] prophet gives us example of a slave who
[1:44:59] was sold who was in Europe amen he was
[1:45:03] working one of the chambas there but
[1:45:05] here in Africa where he came from he was
[1:45:08] a
[1:45:09] son of a king amen and the Bible and the
[1:45:14] prophet says that he behaved differently
[1:45:17] why because he knew his identity
[1:45:24] blessed be the name of the
[1:45:34] Lord they are different blessed be the
[1:45:37] name of the
[1:45:38] Lord but when you find a
[1:45:42] Christians young
[1:45:45] Brothers cracking
[1:45:49] jokes
[1:45:51] Chu blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[1:45:55] he say he tells us that having a high
[1:45:57] priest over the house of God let us
[1:46:00] throw with True Heart in full Assurance
[1:46:03] of Faith amen having our hearts
[1:46:08] sprinkled from unevoc
[1:46:11] [Applause]
[1:46:13] conscious and our bodies washed with
[1:46:16] pure water let us hold fast the pro of
[1:46:21] our faith without
[1:46:24] wavering brother was
[1:46:30] wavering let us hold first the
[1:46:32] profession of our faith
[1:46:46] without there must be a line a
[1:46:48] difference between the world
[1:46:51] in the church blessed be the name of the
[1:46:54] Lord
[1:46:57] amen who we are we will be different
[1:47:01] from the world because brother sister
[1:47:04] the world does not come to
[1:47:07] church it is the church members it is
[1:47:10] the Believers in the church it is the
[1:47:13] Saints in the church who goes in the
[1:47:16] world and bring the world to the
[1:47:19] church
[1:47:21] blessed be the name of the
[1:47:24] Lord it is very hard for the world to
[1:47:27] come in the
[1:47:29] church that is the people in the church
[1:47:32] who go out there and bring the world
[1:47:35] into the
[1:47:36] church and the moment the world enters
[1:47:39] the church there is the hinderance to
[1:47:41] the work of God blessed be the name of
[1:47:43] the Lord amen but if we have clear
[1:47:48] conscious amen
[1:47:51] If We Hold Fast that which is
[1:47:57] good would have a wonderful service
[1:48:03] amen blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:48:06] that is the working of the devil those
[1:48:08] are the tricks of the enemy because the
[1:48:11] devil knows it's very hard for him to
[1:48:13] enter here amen because the devil will
[1:48:17] have to get a vessel to work through
[1:48:22] blessed be the name of the Lord but this
[1:48:25] morning brother sister I want us to know
[1:48:27] who we are to realize blessed be the
[1:48:31] name of the Lord that we are the
[1:48:32] children of God we are the redeemed the
[1:48:36] prophet tells us that without you even
[1:48:40] the the apostles the saint will not be
[1:48:45] perfected
[1:48:46] amen without the bride of Christ
[1:48:51] Christ they will remain in their
[1:48:54] grave Abraham will remain where he
[1:48:58] is blessed be the name of the Lord the
[1:49:01] Saints will remain where they are they
[1:49:04] are waiting for us amen and the Bible
[1:49:08] says that the bride has made herself
[1:49:11] ready by
[1:49:13] what by the
[1:49:15] word we are
[1:49:18] cleansed Brothers Samuel I would just
[1:49:21] request you to you try to go and stand
[1:49:24] behind Deacon
[1:49:33] Brothers I don't expect you to do that
[1:49:36] this time unless you're
[1:49:47] suffering begins from here
[1:49:51] amen if they would only the prophet say
[1:49:54] that uh in the message the DAT of Jesus
[1:49:56] Christ that I know this to be the truth
[1:49:59] I know people don't realize who they are
[1:50:02] every person in here can live above
[1:50:09] sin can live without
[1:50:12] sin live in
[1:50:16] God you will make mistakes but the blood
[1:50:20] of Christ will forgive
[1:50:24] you amen and that's what we have read
[1:50:27] here that having there for boldness to
[1:50:30] enter in the Holiness of holies by the
[1:50:33] blood of Christ amen by the blood of
[1:50:37] Jesus and here he says but the blood of
[1:50:41] Christ will forgive
[1:50:44] you if only we realize who we are
[1:50:47] blessed be the name of the Lord every
[1:50:50] man every woman every boy every girl can
[1:50:55] live above
[1:51:00] sin can live above
[1:51:03] unbelief what is hindering the work of

[1:51:32] remember sometime back we read that

[1:52:15] church will be
[1:52:16] taken those will remain here they will
[1:52:20] have no more
[1:52:22] salvation blessed be the name of the

[2:03:43] let me give you this example a young man
[2:03:45] in the Bible who has his father for his
[2:03:48] inheritance
[2:03:50] and the father sold his portion and gave
[2:03:52] it to him and this the Bible says he
[2:03:55] went to a far country and he was there
[2:03:58] he
[2:03:59] enjoyed with girls with
[2:04:02] babes
[2:04:09] cassers with
[2:04:15] cheeks don't think that again
[2:04:19] brother sister there even people in the
[2:04:21] Bible but look at the end
[2:04:25] game blessed be the name of the Lord and
[2:04:29] some they have gotten chance to come
[2:04:31] back and repent but you may not have
[2:04:34] that
[2:04:35] chance
[2:04:38] amen he sold everything he enjoyed
[2:04:42] himself as long as he had
[2:04:45] cash as long as he was big wallet
[2:04:49] he had
[2:04:51] friends he could receive
[2:04:58] calls you know when everything is okay

[2:05:11] moment promotion after promotion Victory
[2:05:14] after
[2:05:16] Victory blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:05:19] but this young man time
[2:05:21] came that's why I always say that
[2:05:26] there's no we need to try our best
[2:05:29] speaking to young men or our young
[2:05:32] children at home but when you are born a
[2:05:35] man child
[2:05:40] brother because time will
[2:05:43] come you don't even need your parent to
[2:05:46] tell you what to
[2:05:47] do hey
[2:05:49] amen because in man man is built with
[2:05:56] responsibility this young man after
[2:05:58] enjoying time came and now life was
[2:06:09] hard he had
[2:06:12] Amnesia Because by the time you get
[2:06:15] appetite for pig
[2:06:17] food
[2:06:28] rotten
[2:06:30] stuff full of
[2:06:36] marot but when he was there blessed be
[2:06:39] the name of the Lord
[2:06:42] amen I believe maybe it was one morning
[2:06:45] maybe that evening he was so angry
[2:06:49] to the extent that that day even maybe
[2:06:51] the boss never fed the
[2:06:56] pigs but something started to move
[2:06:59] inside him amen he had a strong throat
[2:07:04] he had a strong conviction in his
[2:07:08] heart which was
[2:07:11] unusual
[2:07:15] amen he had a restless night like
[2:07:20] Jacob praise be to God Jacob had good
[2:07:24] days he could play streaks and
[2:07:28] everything was okay but one
[2:07:31] day something happened to
[2:07:35] Jacob Jacob was not himself he had no
[2:07:38] peace
[2:07:40] amen he had no
[2:07:42] peace desperation was building in his
[2:07:47] heart
[2:07:49] and
[2:07:50] realize he was not at peace with
[2:07:55] laan
[2:08:17] Jacob
[2:08:19] maybe Jacob came and speak like she SP
[2:08:22] he spoke to the wife and told her you
[2:08:24] know
[2:08:30] what but that was
[2:08:33] not laan that was God Amen when God want
[2:08:39] you to
[2:08:40] move he will do something he will create
[2:08:44] a stuation
[2:08:46] amen when God want to to move from where
[2:08:49] you are he will create a situation
[2:08:56] there so Jacob's time for moving had
[2:09:00] come this young
[2:09:07] man
[2:09:17] brother
[2:09:22] amen that was pig food for your
[2:09:27] information yeah it was Hogs
[2:09:31] food km Hogs
[2:09:35] food
[2:09:40] food blessed be the name of the
[2:09:47] Lord
[2:09:52] that's why I always give that
[2:09:58] example this young man thought T every
[2:10:02] Christian time will come when you have
[2:10:05] to think
[2:10:08] twice amen because inside you there is a
[2:10:11] seed of
[2:10:13] God inside you you have a predestinated
[2:10:17] seed that's why even when Jonah was
[2:10:20] cast in the Well's
[2:10:26] Bell the world could not swallow
[2:10:30] him and when Jonah realized who you are
[2:10:33] when this young man realized who he
[2:10:39] was he said I will go back to my father
[2:10:42] even the servants they are much much
[2:10:44] better than us better than me
[2:10:47] here
[2:10:52] amen and God was watching in the message
[2:10:55] the prodal
[2:11:06] son
[2:11:13] amen by the day he left
[2:11:16] home his father never had peace in his
[2:11:20] heart every day every night maybe it
[2:11:24] became nightmare for her for him the
[2:11:28] mother was not happy
[2:11:31] amen the mother was
[2:11:33] troubled children most time they trouble
[2:11:36] their mother more than their
[2:11:38] fathers blessed be the name of the
[2:11:41] Lord amen when he knew he who he was he
[2:11:46] knew that the father was a king the
[2:11:47] father was rich the father had servant
[2:11:50] then said come and by and that's what
[2:11:53] God want from
[2:11:54] you amen it is a hard decision most the
[2:11:59] time to quit with that
[2:12:02] lifestyle but that is the decision God
[2:12:05] want amen every time God is waiting to
[2:12:09] see when is he making that
[2:12:14] decision blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:12:19] so when he made that
[2:12:21] decision God was
[2:12:24] happy one
[2:12:26] evening maybe it became the father's
[2:12:29] routine every evening was think about
[2:12:31] his son I wish this young man knew how I
[2:12:34] loved him maybe thinks that right now if
[2:12:37] he comes back there's nothing much for
[2:12:39] him but that was just something small I
[2:12:42] want him to First go and face the other
[2:12:44] side of the
[2:12:46] world what we
[2:13:12] [Music]
[2:13:13] amen the only Refuge is the
[2:13:16] word
[2:13:21] but outside the
[2:13:30] word blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:13:33] when this young man realized who he
[2:13:36] was that very day maybe the father was
[2:13:40] there the Bible says when he was there
[2:13:42] he saw him from a far distance then the
[2:13:45] father ran amen
[2:13:48] when man sin in Eden the same God was
[2:13:53] just
[2:13:54] portraying what he did amen that Parable
[2:13:58] shows God when man sin in Eden God was
[2:14:02] not happy amen God missed that
[2:14:10] Fellowship so he was there
[2:14:13] waiting but thank God for Jesus Christ
[2:14:16] blessed be the name of the Lord and when
[2:14:19] he
[2:14:20] came praise the Lord he started
[2:14:24] preaching the gospel telling as the
[2:14:26] kingdom of God is at hand repent amen
[2:14:31] the way back is

[2:15:46] Plantation not all M mures at the same
[2:15:51] time God has a reason why it's like that
[2:15:57] amen but does it mean that the one that
[2:15:59] comes after the first fruit they are
[2:16:02] abandoned the answer is
[2:16:04] no we are in God's Garden amen the
[2:16:09] prophet say that we are different
[2:16:10] flowers in God's
[2:16:14] Garden we are different fruits in God's
[2:16:17] Garden

[2:17:26] God uses
[2:17:28] desperation to squeeze to bring out the
[2:17:31] best of us blessed be the name of the

[2:21:46] go
[2:22:00] and even God is happy when he sees that
[2:22:04] we know where we are standing he says I
[2:22:07] have children who knows that I'm their
[2:22:10] father amen he also brags about us who
[2:22:15] knows their responsibility who knows
[2:22:18] where they are supposed to be what they
[2:22:20] supposed to do and what they are not
[2:22:22] supposed to do
[2:22:24] amen every parent when he sees the son
[2:22:29] doing his will he becomes
[2:22:32] happy that's the same apply to our God

[2:22:38] cannot be
[2:22:41] deceived if you know that brother langa

[2:40:29] were
[2:40:30] beaten they were trying to scare them
[2:40:33] but the Bible says they went and locked

[2:50:10] no it's my right it's my right our
[2:50:14] church
[2:50:15] my
[2:50:18] Bishop but if we know who we
[2:50:21] are that now we are the children of
[2:50:27] God what God want and what God
[2:50:31] detest and we walk accordingly in Joshua
[2:50:35] he say that if you keep my
[2:50:37] commandment and you devate not from it
[2:50:41] it shall be well with you all the days
[2:50:44] of your life not only for a day a year a
[2:50:47] week but all the days of your
[2:50:52] life and that's why God spoke to Joshua
[2:50:55] and told him be strong and be courageous
[2:51:00] as I was with Moses shall I be with you
[2:51:04] but there was a condition if you keep my
[2:51:12] commandment and Jesus said if you love
[2:51:14] me we shall keep we have to keep his
[2:51:16] commandment he says commandment is light
[2:51:18] is easy his yoke is light
[2:51:23] amen may God help
[2:51:27] us may God help
[2:51:31] us I know but may God give us the
[2:51:42] grace it says here that curs not a
[2:51:45] therefore your
[2:51:47] confidence which had a great recompense
[2:51:51] of
[2:51:56] reward do not cast your
[2:51:59] confidence and our confidence is in the
[2:52:05] Lord as I'm finishing say that they may
[2:52:08] be repudiated there may be question
[2:52:11] indeed to human
[2:52:13] Minds
[2:52:16] and they may not even seems to
[2:52:21] qualify nevertheless they are the
[2:52:24] messenger for the age God uses Abraham
[2:52:28] he lied listen to something
[2:52:31] here he used Moses he
[2:52:35] rebelled Jonah
[2:52:38] disobeyed Samson
[2:52:40] sinned David murdered he also used
[2:52:46] Joshua and Joseph and those with severe
[2:52:51] blemish for outnumber those who his who
[2:52:56] his stories seems to be perfect all way
[2:53:00] all and
[2:53:03] are none dare any that he used them by
[2:53:08] and through the holy spirit that they
[2:53:10] may put within them uh that he put
[2:53:14] within him them you
[2:53:18] see I don't think that God sister God
[2:53:21] can use you so God can use
[2:53:25] you it's just knowing that it is God
[2:53:28] working not us
[2:53:33] working he said that comment was written
[2:53:37] and when Paul wrote Abraham's commentary
[2:53:39] he never mentioned one thing about
[2:53:41] Abram's
[2:53:42] unbelief no no no no never was even
[2:53:45] accounted for him he said Abraham
[2:53:49] struggled not at the promise of God
[2:53:52] through unbelief but was strong and
[2:53:55] giving praise to
[2:53:57] God Abraham did not look at his
[2:54:00] weaknesses he looked at the strength of
[2:54:03] God the ability of God the calling of
[2:54:07] God he never even called himself but God
[2:54:10] called him but because God called you
[2:54:14] you never asked you never went to God
[2:54:16] God called me called me no he found you
[2:54:18] where he called you so since God called
[2:54:22] you God has full responsibility of
[2:54:28] you because he
[2:54:41] knows blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:54:45] you know the story of Abraham but here
[2:54:47] he says the commentary was given that he
[2:54:50] never staggered at the promise of
[2:54:57] God in the message show us the father
[2:54:59] and it will sair he say that the life of
[2:55:02] God is in you and his and he's adopted
[2:55:06] you and you are sons of God you were for
[2:55:10] ordained for a Son of God you were in

[2:55:23] his honor and Glory Not For Shame God
[2:55:27] manifested us this day for his honor and
[2:55:32] Glory the same power that spoke the
[2:55:35] world to existence is in those people
[2:55:37] that got the Holy Ghost now you see if
