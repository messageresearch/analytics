[4:31] despising nazareth
[4:35] the extent that some asked a question
[4:40] can something
[4:54] our
[5:25] we went to a university called adama
[5:28] university prague and i'm university
[5:30] but we were not allowed to enter the
[5:32] campus because there was a political
[5:35] situation that because of the political
[5:37] situation that was in the area
[5:40] university
[5:41] yeah
[5:44] we met and witnessed to a few people but
[5:47] it wasn't long until we had to switch to

[6:03] [Music]
[6:05] in which we are witnessing to many
[6:07] university students
[6:12] this is now in adam
[6:17] the lord was trying to plan things
[6:20] i could take a cable and i did not even

[41:18] i want to read
[41:22] that you just
[41:24] be patient
[41:26] how many will do this
[41:28] is the holy spirit
[41:39] there is only one special group of
[41:41] people in this world nsc
[41:46] and that is the christian narrative
[41:49] those who have received jesus christ
[41:52] christ
[41:56] in the name of the lord jesus
[41:58] they are the only special categories
[42:42] and here we have our example
[42:45] and his name is
[42:48] now we are going to go through that
[42:50] scripture in the end
[42:54] for now i would like us to look at this
[42:56] bathroom
[43:50] when he maketh his sons to inherit that
[43:52] which he
[43:56] that he may not make the sign of the
[43:59] beloved first born before the son of the
[44:02] hatred
[44:11] you need to read that out of your lugana
[44:13] bible because that was not a correct
[44:15] translation
[44:16] i'll read verses again then it shall be
[44:19] when he maketh his sons to inherit that
[44:21] which he has that he may not make the
[44:23] first the son of the beloved firstborn
[44:25] before the son of the headed which is
[44:28] indeed the first born read versus
[44:41] [Music]
[45:05] [Music]
[45:17] for the first born by giving him a
[45:19] double portion of all that he has
[45:22] for he is the beginning of his strength
[45:24] and the right of his and the right of
[45:26] the first born is his
[45:29] anger oh
[45:34] [Music]
[45:48] hallelujah hallelujah now i know we will
[45:52] go a bit slow in the beginning because i
[45:54] want to teach something very nice
[46:12] the law
[46:54] you know that very well
[46:56] is that correct she's true you know you
[46:58] will always have the favor right
[47:00] in you and the one who is not the
[47:02] favorite
[47:05] law says
[47:07] if the first
[47:10] [Music]
[47:50] goes to the firstborn
[47:54] i'm already everybody are you following
[47:55] me
[47:57] so now that was the law
[47:59] according to the law
[48:01] then you would continue to say
[48:04] now
[48:05] he would also give the firstborn a
[48:08] double portion of all that he has
[48:12] [Music]
[48:16] hallelujah amen praise the name of the
[48:18] lord come here there's a brother coming
[48:20] from rwanda so i need you to see if he
[48:22] is the one who just helped him give the
[48:24] directions hallelujah
[48:27] hallelujah
[48:28] church i want you to follow me
[48:31] he says
[48:33] that
[48:35] another portion
[48:38] of course everybody gets a portion his
[48:40] question from the father
[48:44] but now when it becomes the firstborn
[48:54] remaining instead of his father when his
[48:56] father is dead
[49:16] gifts of silver and of gold and of
[49:18] precious things
[49:21] and examination
[49:23] with the first cities in judah
[49:27] but the kingdom gave him
[50:32] [Applause]
[50:38] amen
[50:52] the spiritual authority
[50:56] amen amen
[50:58] you know he was the one to become the
[51:00] priest
[51:02] as we will find out later that uh roman
[51:05] reigns
[51:21] for now but let me not go ahead of
[51:23] myself
[51:26] how many are following me
[51:28] i know sometimes when we have to go deep
[51:29] and study the bible some people go off
[51:31] so i want to remember i'm a bible you
[51:33] know you see many together
[52:01] you are the first born into the kingdom
[52:04] of god
[52:08] by the holy spirit
[52:13] we
[52:14] are first born
[52:16] today
[52:24] now remember that we have read in
[52:26] revelation and zechariah must come right
[52:28] after the tribulation
[52:30] the church of the first born does not go
[52:33] through the tribulation
[52:38] there are coming times if he said that
[52:40] he didn't end up with when there will be
[52:42] a tribulation on earth
[53:13] and there will be a new system in the
[53:15] world whatever that way in korea in
[53:17] cameroon see there will be a new world
[53:20] order
[53:22] in pia muncie you know new world
[53:24] financial systems
[53:40] if you don't believe me well that one's
[53:41] the kid is don't believe what i'm
[53:43] telling you
[53:44] you always be here to say yes
[53:47] but it will not be a good time for you
[53:50] because wherever he is
[54:47] and if they are not doing so well they
[54:49] are under a cup
[54:52] [Music]
[56:26] it has happened before
[56:40] it is he that was he that is
[56:45] [Music]
[56:58] they will rise fast
[57:00] what about us
[57:01] hallelujah amen then we wish our life
[57:06] and remain here on our future
[57:08] but also in christ
[57:24] will
[57:36] amen why do you think we get excited
[57:38] when we hear the world
[57:42] because
[57:45] we are calling for that supernatural
[57:46] body
[57:50] it's not a fleshy excitement
