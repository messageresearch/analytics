role less foreign a little more sound luke chapter one verse 26 [Music] ah everyone there for now reading uh verses 26 of 21 28. if you are there say amen amen i am reading in jesus name memory is and and in the sixth month the angel gabriel of galilee named nazareth to a virgin whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that at highly favored the lord is with thee blessed [Music] let us pray father we ask that these words we have read that you will uh power inspiration on them and that they will be a blessing to us with someone but never wasn't no okay i thought with someone now this morning i just want to welcome you the house of the lord we are in the house of the lord and we have a reason to be happy it is sunday morning sunday which means we are remembering the resurrection of jesus christ foreign so this morning i have a special subject to speak on you know but before i get into a requesting for your undivided attention uh i am requesting that you follow me closely and that you let the holy spirit use me to be a blessing to you more how many have ever had a phrase hail mary you see this is the confusion okay but you can put it up on the screen here for me it says verse 28 okay just a moment verse 20 yeah let us back up on verse 36 and and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto the city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin especially to a man who whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virginia's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou are highly favored now to me welcome and so when the angel of the lord and gabriel came from before the presence he came down and he he said unto mary hail mary we have a massage but then again the angel never went ahead to say mother of god that is an addition from the peace of health praise the name of the lord and this morning i say hail mary mary was m [Music] did you know that the church is typed as a woman in the bible and i'm sorry i just went straight to the world you know i've been pondering over these things the whole night so i i i i have a lot to cover so i just went in straight away i want your undivided attention this morning to say come on of the lord a woman of vaccine today what i have in mind is uh the church you know the church is typed for a woman in the bible then of course i will speak also on a woman physical a few things here today that i have on my heart [Music] this was a promise given thousands or hundreds of years before it happens [Music] already given a promise that a virgin shall conceive catholic is and now the church a canister which at that time was supposed to be the virtuous woman you know it had already lost its spiritual virtues instead of having what god had intended for them to have the tempo that m i'm talking about them [Music] she is miserable she thinks that she is uh seeing the chinese and they have taken all the teachings of the word of god and replaced it with their own ideas and you get it as a bible event whenever they come into whatever side and at that time god had given them the word which you said shall conceive and bear a son they it might have been that these pharisees citizens a disease a 47 another said to call you deemed to be the most holy of all of them you decided to prepare where the son will be born i said i would take a taker they must have in their big temples and in their big synagogues prepared a place where the sun will be born [Music] oh [Music] how let me tell you [Music] hallelujah [Applause] but if you to be the bride of god that mary became pregnant maria natsuno and when mary became pregnant the husband was like i thought you gave me a word but he knows i want to be i thought you said you'd be faithful to me i have not seen [Music] is live [Music] is time with me [Music] can you pronounce it on your mouth come on preach with me today oh my god he turned around and went to uh joseph now again and he told him joseph what do you want to do you [Applause] [Music] the life of jesus christ the times i'm going to use might be a little bit theological today but i want you to just open your spiritual mind africa and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and every other every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female created them forgetting to huh [Music] his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living song can you please translate this directly brother and lord the ma dust of the ground hallelujah hallelujah where was the woman oh my gosh the breath of life original in the image of god god expressed the image of himself the woman is always the reflection of the man hallelujah amen that is why [Music] the woman your is you is is when i would a man try to tell you go back to your people one way do you know what you should do comment to his ribs um foreign [Music] [Music] he must he must be somewhere i don't know you hallelujah you see the prophet in the marriage and the voice says also there is nothing that can be so easily deceived as a woman because that can be so easily deceived as a woman young so that the demons can leave his secret frame and another one he must drink petrol and because i've said it come on and show you hallelujah and there is nothing that can be so easily deceived as a woman uh [Music] in the world because they leave their foundations but god has sent us a prophecy get back to the bible praise the name of the lord come here i don't know why you're gonna try it again brother praise the name of the lord you see this fall proves this certainly to be true in the beginning she was not in the original beginning creation oh mukaze [Music] really what they remember but not in a female sex herself at the beginning but she was the byproduct [Music] are you following me now amen praise the name of the lord amen genesis 3 20. let's look at that brother you're distracting me get your get your seat brother genesis 3 20. for his wife's name is listen carefully because she was the mother of all living yes [Music] and why was she called eve hey that was kawa because she was now the mother of only [Music] now are you following me i want to show you a few things in genesis 25. yes genesis 25 and the lord said unto her come on gamba two nations are in the womb malaga and two mana of people shall be separated from thy powers and one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elders shall serve the younger negwanga rimo arena we're talking about red because baker the wife of isaac isaka and before we talk about her name i want you to see the woman because the woman before the fall praise the name of the lord the woman before the fall she was uh called a woman a part of the man but after the woman fell because she ceased to just be a woman [Music] she was now converted from being [Music] isn't that interesting [Music] [Applause] the snake the serpent rather oh no was the beast of the ground why did we go it would work and the bible tells us the serpent [Music] at the same time monkey said she received a seat for my husband and she gave birth to two twins and this twins is hallelujah hallelujah came i will not be killed [Music] [Music] who will of the beast by two ways you mean the right hand of fellowship my fellowshipping with the people that are [Music] foreign and what what is making me speak this way you guys are waiting it will not help you that time what you said watching you get away but now you can be helped [Music] so now we see here in the book of genesis was named because she was the mother of all living and from that time we see it all through scriptures [Music] one of them [Applause] and is and i'm telling you [Music] this [Music] this is the truth we are matching desire to get a messiah we will fly why because i am one of them yes [Music] three three heart tree it's a sad to say but actually this church and then rebecca the true church actually she has twins the name of jesus is hallelujah [Music] my god in the kingdom of god you can move it down through the bible for some of the cheaters i'm a bible you want them to find there's mister people have started back here in heaven and finally we are almost [Applause] um [Music] he became [Music] this is the only way to redeem my brain he accepted to partake of what she did [Music] that we can hallelujah what a great love story hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] let me tell you that is the truth there are some men who have no shame what he had said the ability sister that come on i must those let them die for christ hallelujah amen i don't think i'll finish my stomach hallelujah amen and so if you become a mother of all leaders [Music] god if you're going to give me children in this room i don't have space for nothing and then when you give birth to them begin working with them but followers are working on them teach them raise them up is not legalism hsc might take care of my fault but that is illegal in the way of the world is not illegal my mother here raised me taking me to convention she would refuse me to play with the neighbor's children i never knew why she thought she was being mean oh your father your mother when they don't know who but as long you cannot tell me foreign is okay now let's look at a woman after the four category praise if i left here see number one being a pastor of this church come to america i will neglect you name by the way [Music] believe me not but you see husbands need to give it according to knowledge you are a stupid woman that you can no longer give leadership to my way you need to understand and sometimes i think women demand for too much and then she will come to you why didn't you do it [Music] [Music] and so sometimes when people see that it just falls and my wife happened to sit on that chest and so she almost fell inside that way and she made a noise and then i it made me get a jumper named booker because i was very busy when you never was starting or something nothing in summer i'm sorry [Applause] don't be so lazy and you shall receive giving honor to the wife brother on your wife to jesus [Music] okay [Music] god is [Music] but what does the husband do now your mom is a child he must have a wife and i must have a virtuoso so don't give a reason to your husband look elsewhere you find many times when uh when when a woman is losing a man to other women enough is oh now what are you doing to tell you what he went through but before he tells you you can't even let him get up oh it's like as if i'm
