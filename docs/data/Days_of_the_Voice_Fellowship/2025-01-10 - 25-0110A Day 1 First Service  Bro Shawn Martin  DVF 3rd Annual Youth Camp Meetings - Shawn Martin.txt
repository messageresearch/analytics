accomplish he says I want to tell you something now in the message works is Faith expressed work on that pation that SP of a moment we may not stay here for four five six days you may you may wonder what is this all about you know Gathering people from everywhere different churches different countries different places to just come and be together for just a few days just a few Services I want to say this it doesn't take God a month to do something it takes just a moment and as these men of God are going to be preaching all through these meeting work on that pulsation that SP of A Moment Like Joshua did like Mary Magdalene all those just that moment when something is revealed to you grab it hold to it that SP of a [Music] moment so don't every service is going to be special don't worry about those who have not arrived yet you are here tell your neighbor I am here praise God and when something is revealed to you as the man of God will be speaking don't wait for the next service don't wait for your favorite preacher that SP of a moment he says grab it hold to it something will take place amen amen amen amen this is what I believe for this meeting praise God we are already behind shedule but it's no longer an announcement it is now a reality this is the moment we have waited for amen and God has sent uh the men of God to us how many appreciate them amen uh our pastor trust Manda from Zimbabwe trust Manda amen shall we receive him praise to God Amen and uh brother uh um brother Andrew Glover from the United States amen praise God God has great things in store for this

amen am well it's uh it's uh good to be a Christian amen and to serve the Lord and um I uh just say it's an honor to to be here uh here to speak to you today or this week and uh we're just believe in Mighty things from the Lord amen amen amen and how many's got a need that you need the Lord just to touch amen amen well I I know that God is Not only able to meet your need but he's willing to meet your need amen I believe God doesn't ordain things just to ordain them that he's called this meeting Amen to meet with us amen and do special things and uh so we just counted an honor I uh as your pastor said we hadn't met before but uh it's just an honor to to meet him amen and um an honor to to be here with brother Andrew Glover and uh we've known each other for a few years and and we certainly appreciate him praise the Lord and um if you have your Bibles we're just going to get right into the word amen and we're going to um turn to Psalms 107 and read a couple verses Psalms 107 praise the Lord amen [Music] amen amen uh let's see here Psalms 106 7 and 19 we'll start there amen and it says then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses 20th verse he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions [Music] and then if you'll turn to uh the book of Colossians the first chapter amen and um Colossians 1 and verse 12 amen when you're there you can say Amen it says giv thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of The Inheritance in the of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear [Music] son can you say that with me he hath delivered [Music] us from the power of darkness and the 14th verse in whom we have Redemption through through his blood even the Forgiveness of [Music] sins amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our father precious Lord Lord we've come gather together expecting you to move in our midst father we we believe that you're coming is soon this could be the last service the last meeting that we have and father there's no doubt many needs that are present and we're asking that you would come and just minister to your people father help me get myself out of the way anoint gift that you placed within me and I pray that your Holy Spirit would just move across this [Music] building and touch the lives of your people father may this be the beginning of new great things in you father break the power of Darkness over the people we pray that Faith would arise in the hearts we ask it in Jesus Christ name and everybody says amen amen you can you can have your seats amen so we read here he sent his word and healed them and delivered them and this word healing it means to make free from injury or disease to make sound or whole to restore to change the situation so God sent his word to heal to store to change the situation and the prophet taught us that healing doesn't just go belong to the the physical body but there's also healing of the Soul as well so there is a restoration for our soul as well as for our body and so when God sends his word it's a display of God's grace and I'm so glad that we have the word of God today how glad that you have the word of God Amen now as so many does not understand the importance of the word but you see God did not send his word for us just to uh uh to learn about and to reite but he sent his word to heal and to deliver God sends his word for a reason you see when God sends his word he's looking for results how many believes that amen and when we see that his word has been sent then we look for results yes sir amen so God does not want us to know his word by history God ain't here to give us a a history lesson but he wants us to look look for the results that his word will [Music] bring and he wants us to experience it and I'm so glad I've experienced it I'm not here to paint a fire for you I'm here to tell you about the experience that God has given us now what is a Christian it's the results of God's word God sent his word and it produced a Christian see God's word is powerful and as long as we have that word there ain't no devil that's going to defeat us you see the the prophet taught us that in the beginning God gave man his word amen see he knew that the devil was lurking around he knew what the devil was capable of so he gave his word to man as a defense against the devil the Devil Couldn't man as long as he stayed with the word of [Music] God the devil couldn't touch man he he couldn't ruin creation as long as man believed God's word but because man fell in the beginning we now know what SAT is capable of we see the corruption in the land we see ungodly things that men do but I got good news for you the word of God is still our defense it's a defense against any demon that comes against us that word of God will help the youngest person in here the word of God is Not only just for us ministers it's not just for our parents but the word of God is for you young people as well yes sir you see God gave us his word because it's the best thing that he could give us God knows how to fortify his people God knows the power that the word [Music] has so you see Satan cannot triumph over God's word no matter what the devil does no matter what he tries to bring no matter how discouraged you are Satan cannot try over the word of God the word of God Will Save The rottenest Sinner the word of God will heal the worst uh uh uh uh uh sickness in the land now Jesus proved to us that the weapon is the is the word of God he proved that it's the best weapon against the devil you see Jesus had power upon power but he didn't use one of them powers to defeat the Devil with he used the word of God and the prophet said he did it to show us that the weakest Christian can defeat anytime anywhere any place Hallelujah under any [Music] condition you may not have a lot of gifts in your life you may be one that cannot sing you may be one that just feels like you're nothing but you have the word of God so God did not leave you helpless he didn't leave us preachers helpless he didn't leave us parents helpless and he didn't leave you young people helpless now you don't have to feel saved maybe you're sick here today and you and you've asked God to heal you well you don't have to feel like you're [Music] healed to defeat the Devil you don't have to feel [Music] saved to defeat the Devil you don't have to feel like you're on the mountain top to Beat the Devil with see the prophet said the devil can beat you around and around the stump on your feelings but when he meets the word of God he can't come on that so no matter how low I feel Satan cannot triumph over me no matter how discouraged I am Satan cannot triumph over me for I have the word of God well aren't you glad for that now you see the Book of Genesis shows us that the word of God has to be sent first before the power of God can be Genesis 1 and 2 it tells us that the Earth was without form it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light you see why did God send his word because God was going to change the situation see his word went forth Let There Be and life followed it now the Bible says that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now all I've got to say to you is that God not only wanted light in the beginning but he desired Sons and Daughters of God to stand in this age and Triumph over the [Music] enemy can you say now he sent his word to change the situation and if he did it back then then God doesn't send us an emotion he doesn't send us a feeling today to defeat the Devil with he sends his word can you say Amen now why did God send his word in the [Applause] beginning because there was seed that was laying under the water that needed to come forth well where did that seed come from well God sent his word and created it the prophet said he formed those seeds by his own word for there was nothing else to make that seed out of and the prophet said them seeds would then transform themselves into the plant that the word of God has spoken them to be so God created seeds like a tree a plant a flower grass he planted all kinds of seeds for the purpose of them coming forth and being what he called them to be see he didn't form the seed just to lay dormant and he didn't form you just for you to lay dormant he didn't put them seeds in the ground for them to be powerless by the darkness can you say Amen now the prophet said the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed we know that God made the world out of things that does not appear and he did it by his own word can you say Amen yes sir see the word formed the seed and that's how you are a Christian today is the word made you can you say Amen the word called you to be what you are so that seed laay dormant because the the the darkness was laying or or the world was laying under Darkness the Bible says that the Earth was without uh a form and it was void the prophet said the world was covered with water and laid in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere but the spirit of God moved upon the water and the word went forth and God said let there be light and he sent his word by speaking his word now I want you to know now he sends his word by speaking it can you say Amen the prophet said at that time the Mist cleared away and darkness went to one corner and light shined at the other side what it tells us is that God's word will defeat the power of Darkness you see when God sent his word the prophet said the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a Garden of Eden the power of the word of God we see the power of the word in the vision of the Prophet Ezekiel he had a vision of the dry bones it was such a bad situation Them Bones were scattered all over the place and when God asked that Prophet can these bones live that Prophet had no answer and he just said only thou knowest that God was going to change the situation and he began to speak and and sent that word by a prophet and he said Son of Man prophesy can you say amen and the word of the Lord went forth and it brought about four stages of restoration now we know that in the fourth stage the word brought life to them bones and the Bible says they rose up a mighty Army what that word was was a message of life can you say amen amen the message of life amen and when the message of Life went forth God breathed upon that bones and they begin to live now Church the message of life has been sent to us can you say amen and when God send something when he sends his word then something's got to happen Hallelujah for God promised that the word that goes out of his mouth will not return unto him void but it shall accomplish I said it shall accomplish that word shall accomplish God's going to have the desire of his heart that word is going to have an effect and it shall prosper in the thing where unto he sends it now I want to say this if you want to see God in action look what he promised don't look at what the world's doing don't look at all the chaos don't look at the trouble in your life look at what God promised can you say Amen if you want to see the supernatural look at what God promised yes sir see find out what he promised amen see now you know I don't want to know what man about what man says about [Music] things can you say man you know what I'm not even here to look at you yes and give you my opinion of you [Music] you don't want to know what I what I have to say you can look at yourself and say I am just in a mess and I can look at you and say yeah you're right but that ain't going to help you but see when you see what God has promised God promised I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world God promised that no weapon formed against you is going to prosper that word will never fail that word will not return unto him void whatever he promised is going to happen that's why your pastor fought so hard amen even though the devil was resisting he knew that God would honor his [Applause] word God promised where two or three are gathered in his name he will will be here in their midst and the devil can't stop it the devil can't stop God from coming in Among Us God's word is going to be fulfilled I don't care how impossible it seems you might got a lost loved one that you're praying for you may have been praying for the baptism of the Holy Ghost you may be praying for salvation and the devil is telling you you've gone too far but no matter how impossible it seems God will fulfill his word in your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] life Hallelujah I don't care how long it takes I don't care how dark the hour is God's word is a promise to us I say to you the word that God sends is a promise to us yes sir it's our absolute can you say the word is our [Music] absolute God doesn't send his word for us to argue over God doesn't send his word for as the question God sends his word as an absolute to you you can rest your soul on it you can rest your faith in it it's your defense against the enemy well can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise [Applause] now every promise of God is a predestinated seed how many believes in predestination every word of God is a predestinated seed therefore God cannot lie can you say that with me God cannot lie turn around tell your neighbor God cannot lie I I know it's dark but God cannot lie I know the tears may be flowing that God cannot lie back may be against the wall but cannot [Applause] lie we came all the way here to tell you God cannot lie I didn't come here wondering if God was going to move I know God's going to [Applause] move because God cannot lie he's obligated to his word he cannot lie so he's obligated to his word he's not obligated to you he's not obligated to you he's not obligated to me but he's obligated to this word concerning me he's ated to his word concerning you he wouldn't have sent you his word if he didn't mean it but because he sent his word he is determined to fulfill his [Applause] word amen well do you love him oh [Applause] now what is a word it's an expression of a [Music] thought God's word is an expression of his own thoughts I did not express them all right his word is not an expression of my thoughts it's not an expression of our brother's thoughts it's not an expression of your thoughts his word is an expression of his own thoughts so then the prophet tells us God's thoughts are eternal and they are real see God's word deals with the plan of God and the purpose of God see I may have thoughts about myself I may have thoughts about myself and may be may they may be negative thoughts how many's ever had negative thoughts about yourself you might even have complexes about yourself and you you might think well I just don't know if I'm going to make it I just don't know if I can ever overcome I I I just don't know if I'll ever be healed I've been seeking the Holy Ghost I just don't know if I'll ever get it them are your thoughts not God's thoughts there may be some of you here today that feel like you cross the line cross the line of Mercy but them are your thoughts but God's thoughts are expressed in his word and they are Eternal and they are real they are real well can I tell you God never thought of you being a sinner yeah God never thought of you being a sinner he never thought of you being lost and going to hell he never thought of you being so decrepit and down hardened he never thought of you being defeated by the enemy the Bible says hell was prepared for the devil and his angels they were not prepared for you Hallelujah hell was not prepared for the Sons and Daughters of God so the devil might be telling you you're going to hell but you tell him that was never in the thoughts of God and God's thoughts are Eternal and they are real Hallelujah I know I was born a sinner but God's thoughts about me were were more real than me being a sinner I found out the reason why I could be changed from a sinner to a saint is because God never thought of me as a sinner Hallelujah and anything that was not in God's mind is subject to change [Music] Hallelujah well praise the Lord glorify [Applause] him Hallelujah am see God's thoughts are Eternal and they are real so his thoughts did not form from his imagination you can imagine something and it's not real you can imagine you had a conversation that never happened you can imagine things that never transpire but God's thoughts are Eternal and they are [Applause] real that's why you always were a Son of God that's why the prophet said you were never saved on any given day you was always saved in the mind of God [Music] [Applause] and I'll just tell you right now God's not worried about losing you [Music] [Applause] either Hallelujah as the prophet said you're safe you're safe you don't have to worry about tomorrow you don't have to worry about your future you're safe God sent his word to let you know you're [Applause] safe you're Justified you never did it in the first place Hallelujah glor Glory Glory you see the thoughts of God did not come from God just simply wishing for it but God he formulated a plan by his thoughts the Bible says known unto God are all of his works from the beginning known unto God are all his works from the beginning says the Bible says he knew the end from the beginning the prophet said he created the world first by his thought and I say to you he created Sons and Daughters by his thought first Ephesians 1 and 1 through 5 it says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as hath chosen Us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having pre destinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will you see what Paul is saying God wasn't forced to save you he wasn't forced to predestinate you he did it of his own good pleasure he chose you before the foundation of the world because they pleased him to do so it please God to prepare heaven for you it pleased him to send his word to deliver you see it please God now Romans 829 think of it now created he created sons and daughters in His Thoughts by his thoughts first Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified he did it by his thoughts you're not in your glorified condition yet but you're already there in his thoughts yeah and his thoughts are Eternal and they are [Applause] [Music] real now the prophet said before there was a world you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew you would be wanting it and he chose you himself because you desired he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus any of you was on the [Music] earth and He sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you to himself Hallelujah God's already been working on your behalf before you ever got here hallelujah and there ain't a thing the devil can do about it and then we think that we have to beg God to heal us we think that we have to beg God to give us the Holy Ghost we think that we have to beg God to deliver us you don't have to beg God to do anything he's already prepared he's already died for it all you have to do is believe in it die die out to your own thinking die out to your own thinking die out to your own [Applause] self and accept his thoughts about you Hallelujah can you say Amen this message that God sent to us is not to get us to beg God it's to get us to receive what he's already done remember a pardon is not a pardon unless received that ain't that right now God's word is a seed a Word of Promise and the prophet said the seed of God is actually placed in US from the foundation of the world that Word of Promise was placed in us before the foundation of the world can you say Amen you're not trying to be saved we're not Christians trying to be a Christian we're not saved trying to be saved we're not living this Christian Life scared of hell you shouldn't serve God because afraid to go to hell can you say Amen Church how many times in the Bible the Bible says fear not fear not the prophet said the problem is is people scared that God will not fulfill his promise you don't have to be scared simply believe that Word of Promise is inside of you can you say Amen now we didn't come into this world reflecting what God called us to be the woman at the well did not come into this world reflecting what God called her to be when Jesus came to her she was not reflecting what God had called her to be but she had a predestinated sea on the inside of her she was a prostitute she was an ill famed woman but God knew her in his thinking and he sent his word to her can you say Amen now notice the word came to her in the form of a man the fullness of the word was in him come on church that word came to her seeking her out hello the word didn't come to her to give her a Bible Lesson the word didn't come to her to give her an emotional F hello but the same God that spoke the word let there be light in the beginning was now in a man Jesus [Applause] Christ and God was in Christ reconciling the World his elect to himself and that same [Applause] word had the same power to change that woman [Applause] situation I'm not going to take much longer but a prophet said this as soon as it spoke it the word spoke to her she said I perceive you're a [Music] prophet and she said I know the Messiah will do this now what did he do to identify himself what did he do to identify who he was he performed the same sign that MZ did to Abraham he discerned her heart and told her her life and she knew she had a teaching that when the Messiah come he will do that same sign and he said I am he now the prophet said what did it do it cleaned out the Blackness and made it all white why there was a seed laying there a predestinated seed it was God's thought before the foundation of the world and because she was a predestinated seed she recognized the word that was s to redeem her can you say amen and the word cleared out all the darkness and the mock and the sin in her life to where she could believe it and quickly the prophet said her sins were forgiven her well do you love him now the prophet said when he pressed his Messiah sign by telling her what she had done she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet and we know the Messiah when he comes he will tell us all things notice she was recognizing him as the Messiah the anointed one because he had met the scripture qualifications the two pieces of paper were coming together for she said we know that when the Messiah cometh now he says what did this do putting the old scripture with the experience that Jesus was given her what did it do it made the Messiah and quickly her sins were forgiven because after beginning she was redeemable because she was in God's thinking at the beginning so it redeemed her or brought her back when she seen the expressed scripture manifested of Jehovah what he was and what he is and we have seen that same sign in this last day I say to you it was more than just a prophet Jesus Christ was made manifest not just in a spoken word body but in a redeemed body he was able to take the body of brother Brandon the body of brother brandom and performed the same Messiah sign can you say am man I say to you it was more than a man that came to us in this age now we're not did find brother brandham brother brandham was just a man he was he he had to be saved just like you and I that God was able to so possess that man to where we could see that it was Christ that has come to us in the form of his word son of man [Applause] revealed in this age didn't have to die for us but he came to claim us for he had already paid the price of redemption Jesus Christ paid the price of redemption in that Corporal body and by his blood he was able to redeem a body amen that he could take full possession of and manifest himself through to claim you and I I hope that makes sense now the word has come to claim you can you say Amen not everybody's going to believe this message of the hour but there is a redeemed people that was in his thinking and it's not that we're any better than anybody else it's not that we are a people without problems but we realize that we're more than just them people we are Sons and Daughters of God well how many sons and daughters of God do we have now you know the Bible says that he will rise with healing in his wings the son of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings now church do you realize the prophet said that that healing in his wing doesn't just mean physical healing of a disease maybe you got arthritis or whatever God's been doing that but he said this heal is actually the changing of our body going from Mortal to immortality church he sent his word I'm so glad that he s his word can we stand to our feet and just lift up our hands musicians will come Hallelujah there's something that is drawing us back oh Hallelujah and the moment she believed quickly her sins were forgiven her hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's just sing this little song on Le oh believe that all things are
