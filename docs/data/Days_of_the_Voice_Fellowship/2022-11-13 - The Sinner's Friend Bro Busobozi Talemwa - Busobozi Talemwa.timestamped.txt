[28:18] while we are still standing to turn to
[28:20] our Bibles in the Book of Luke
[28:24] foreign
[29:05] foreign
[29:31] but may God help us and I'm happy to see
[29:34] all of you have made it this morning
[29:44] we are getting to read the scripture
[29:47] this morning and we are believing that
[29:49] the Lord will speak to us
[29:56] amen may the Lord fill the desires of
[29:59] your heart
[30:04] we will read verses 33 and 34 of Luke 7.
[30:08] Luke foreign
[30:12] for John the Baptist came neither eating
[30:16] bread nor drinking wine and ye say he
[30:19] has a devil the son of man is calm
[30:22] eating and drinking and you say Behold a
[30:26] gluttonous man and a wine Bieber a
[30:29] friend of publicans and sinners
[30:33] is
[30:53] [Music]
[30:57] God bless the reading of his word he may
[30:59] have your seats this morning
[31:03] by the grace of God I would like to
[31:07] speak to you this morning on the subject
[31:09] of the scene as friend all right
[31:17] so John the Baptist came eating and
[31:19] drink
[31:20] um the son of man John the Baptist came
[31:22] and he was not the scripture says he was
[31:27] eating he was neither eating bread nor
[31:29] drinking wine and they say they had a
[31:31] devil may I believe
[31:37] so the people never accepted John the
[31:40] Baptist because according to them the
[31:42] way he was
[31:47] because he was you know drinking eating
[31:50] locusts and wild honey yeah yeah
[31:55] um
[31:58] and the way he was dressed
[32:01] you know the way his hair was made
[32:04] and because the Jews were holy people
[32:10] and they had kept all the Traditions as
[32:13] it was given unto them by Moses
[32:16] they spoke and said that John the
[32:19] Baptist had a devil
[32:23] and indeed according to all the Jewish
[32:25] teachings John the Baptist looked like
[32:27] he had a devil
[32:33] praise the name of the Lord and then
[32:36] Jesus came for Jesus was eating and
[32:39] drinking like the rest of them
[32:42] and they say look at this
[32:49] look at this friend of publicans and
[32:52] sinners
[32:54] so among the things that Jesus was
[32:57] blamed or condemned for was that he was
[33:00] a friend of sinners
[33:02] [Music]
[33:06] the people that were blaming and
[33:08] condemning Jesus were actually the
[33:11] people that had been trained under the
[33:13] law of Moses
[33:15] [Music]
[33:20] they had been raised up under that
[33:23] they have been trained to live holy
[33:26] they had been told not to touch not to
[33:29] tests
[33:37] and you know they have been raised like
[33:39] that
[33:40] and so they had developed a conscience
[33:46] [Music]
[34:15] [Music]
[34:18] that actually the Jews had kept for
[34:21] years and years before the coming of
[34:23] Jesus Christ
[34:24] [Music]
[34:34] [Music]
[34:48] [Music]
[34:50] and you know whenever there is a new
[34:52] thing that is always have to be a change
[34:58] a change of course
[35:01] a change of direction
[35:03] if you want listen church if you want
[35:06] God to do something new for you
[35:09] how to open up your mind and your heart
[35:18] so we see that when Jesus came
[35:21] the Jews never received him
[35:25] and the reason why the Jews never
[35:27] received him because he had received the
[35:30] people that according to them were vile
[35:33] it is
[35:34] [Music]
[35:39] and even Peter himself the disciple of
[35:42] Jesus
[35:44] after Jesus had died and rose again
[35:47] yesterday
[35:49] Peter refused
[35:52] to preach among the Gentiles because
[35:55] according to the him the Gentiles were
[35:57] vile people
[36:04] said things that the Jews were not
[36:07] supposed to eat
[36:09] so according to Peter the Gentiles
[36:13] [Music]
[36:16] and they were not worthy of the gospel
[36:19] of Christ
[36:22] but you know the Jews and the Disciples
[36:25] of Jesus
[36:28] they had one thing that they needed to
[36:30] understand
[36:32] that is what we spoke on on Sunday
[36:35] sister Grace
[36:37] it is
[36:41] hallelujah amen do you know Grace
[36:45] have you found the grace
[36:48] these people did not understand that
[36:50] Grace
[36:52] had to go beyond their tradition
[36:57] and she said how to go beyond what they
[37:00] knew
[37:01] it had to go beyond their Doctrine
[37:04] you know God loves us
[37:08] to the extent that he can break all the
[37:11] existing laws
[37:12] [Music]
[37:16] in order to reach one sinner
[37:20] for when he came he called himself a
[37:22] shepherd
[37:24] and he called himself a good shepherd
[37:27] and he said a Good Shepherd will leave
[37:30] 1909.
[37:40] praise the name of
[37:50] [Music]
[38:17] [Music]
[38:29] but according to Christ the gospel was
[38:32] not and never has it ever been meant for
[38:35] the righteousness
[38:41] the gospel was always meant for The
[38:43] Sinner
[38:45] let us look at a
[38:49] version
[38:50] [Music]
[38:54] it says for John the Baptist has come
[38:57] neither eating bread nor drinking wine
[39:07] the son of man has come eating and
[39:09] drinking and you say look a man who is a
[39:13] glutton and a heavy wind Drinker oh man
[39:15] a woman tonight
[39:20] A friend of tax collectors
[39:24] and and sinners including non-observant
[39:27] Jews
[39:32] and here is the verse 35 he says yet
[39:36] wisdom is Vindicated
[39:40] and shown to be right by all her
[39:43] children
[39:50] his children
[39:52] and here in Brackets it says by the
[39:54] lifestyle
[39:58] a moral character named pieces
[40:08] now Jesus is a friend of sinners yes
[40:11] but it is kind of ironic
[40:17] his followers
[40:21] their lifestyle or whatever their moral
[40:24] characters
[40:36] the followers of Jesus
[40:38] they have this moral standards
[40:41] they have this lifestyle
[40:45] by the name they have the good works and
[40:50] you cannot find anywhere else
[40:53] they are people who follow Muhammad
[40:56] another who follow Buddha Buddha and
[41:00] others
[41:03] if you want to see people that have good
[41:06] morals
[41:10] [Music]
[41:16] come and look at the followers of Jesus
[41:19] Christ
[41:21] but what happened
[41:23] followers of Jesus we are supposed to be
[41:26] sinners
[41:28] in other words when Christ comes to you
[41:32] only comes to you while you are a sinner
[41:36] but by the time he's done with you
[41:38] you are no longer a city
[41:43] praise the name of the Lord
[41:47] Christ he's a sinner's friend in all
[41:49] ages
[41:53] but we are here to support now to the
[41:55] sport now he says
[41:59] that they fail to see it
[42:03] [Music]
[42:04] because it was in human flesh
[42:08] I wonder if we will do the same thing
[42:12] I wonder if we will make the sad mistake
[42:15] that they did
[42:18] I failed to know him
[42:20] they fail to understand who Christ was
[42:23] and why he came
[42:27] they fail to understand why he loved
[42:29] Sinners
[42:31] they fail to understand why he always
[42:34] Associated himself with Sinners
[42:38] and do we believe that Jesus Christ is
[42:41] also the same in our generation
[42:58] [Music]
[43:09] he was identified in a human body
[43:14] a boy that had no education
[43:18] that you've never known him going to
[43:21] school
[43:23] he had no credentials
[43:26] even come out of any he even come out of
[43:29] any organization of that day no
[43:31] education
[43:34] he had no reputation
[43:38] nothing but a crazy man
[43:43] he was
[43:45] a friend of
[43:55] listen to these words he was
[43:57] illegitimately born
[44:03] away
[44:05] and taking his name as the Son of God
[44:10] or calling himself a prophet that this
[44:13] girlian so-called a prophet
[44:17] now all the words I've read
[44:21] people's opinion was about Jesus attack
[44:26] [Music]
[44:38] he's a white people what was the first
[44:41] miracle that Jesus did
[44:46] he turned water into wine
[44:50] praise the name of the Lord
[44:54] is supper
[44:56] they drunk wine
[45:02] I cannot see your thinking
[45:06] but remember when he created that wine
[45:08] at the marriage of Canada
[45:11] the Bible says they drank too much
[45:15] they became satisfied
[45:18] hallelujah amen the Bible did not say
[45:21] they became drunk
[45:22] but they became satisfied
[45:27] and Jesus was associating himself yes
[45:32] with the people of Norway protection now
[45:35] than two other telling them and he was a
[45:39] Man From Galilee
[45:41] he had no credentials whatsoever
[45:45] he had no education whatsoever
[45:48] you know if Jesus was in our generation
[45:52] today
[45:55] few people would regard him to be
[45:57] anything about anything
[45:58] [Music]
[46:00] because Jesus was the worst according to
[46:04] the description of the Jewish cultural
[46:06] religion is
[46:22] but the word was made made manifest
[47:01] amen associating himself with Cena
[47:06] if you don't want Sinners to be
[47:09] associated with Christ where do you want
[47:11] them to be
[47:15] if he has not or had not associated
[47:18] himself with Sinners
[47:20] you would have failed at his mission
[47:24] by the mission of Jesus was seen us
[47:27] foreign
[48:46] what was in the foreign
[49:01] hallelujah amen
[49:03] praise the name of the Lord

[51:16] because of their righteous indignation
[51:20] we have entitlements

[51:48] because that is the mindset of a
[51:50] Pharisees

[52:00] of these people who receive the
[52:01] invitations
[52:23] foreign

[53:49] Jesus Christ identified the same Name by
[53:52] his word in every generation yes
[53:57] praise the name of the Lord
[54:02] identified himself by giving us the
[54:05] message
[54:12] he has given power to become the sons of
[54:16] God
[54:18] we know sin is unbelief of that word
[54:24] sin is not drinking smoking foreign
[54:59] foreign
[55:56] if you do any of those things
[56:00] if you begin going to bars
[56:04] and and is it called whatever it is
[56:08] [Music]
[56:09] you know and they begin smoking
[56:12] begin flirting with women no 10
[56:15] suck it is
[56:18] going to adopt your fornication
[56:21] you know if you begin doing those things
[56:24] it is an indication
[56:26] that in you there is no faith because if
[56:31] you have faith in the word of God
[56:34] you will not do those things
[56:37] that faith in the word of God
[56:40] will be your protection
[56:44] it will be the law of God written not in
[56:47] stone but written on your heart
[56:52] [Music]
[56:54] praise the name of Allah foreign
[57:27] you'd rather accept something else
[57:34] we all the Bible says we were born in
[57:37] sins
[57:38] people can be religious
[57:41] and yet still seeing us
[57:44] before the Lord
[57:46] all people were actually born in sins
[57:50] having not previously done any evil acts
[57:53] [Music]
[57:56] the moment you were born you are
[58:00] actually a sinner
[58:03] having not previously done anything bad
[58:06] foreign
[58:37] [Music]
[59:03] [Music]
[59:06] so Jesus being without sin that yes
[59:11] because in Christ there was no unbelief
[59:16] in the Christ there was no sin
[59:19] he knew not sin
[59:23] so him being without sin
[59:25] he was the only one who worthy yeah
[59:32] he however had to become sin
[59:36] in order to reduce
[59:43] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21
[59:45] and according
[59:48] for he made him to be seen for us
[59:53] who knew no sin that we might be made
[59:56] the righteousness of God in him
[1:00:09] praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:16] we know that because he was tested
[1:00:20] when the devil came to him he's tested
[1:00:24] him time and time again
[1:00:26] he says if you be the Son of God
[1:00:29] make these stones to become bread
[1:00:33] if Jesus
[1:00:36] let me ask you do you think that Jesus
[1:00:38] was able to do that yes
[1:00:45] foreign
[1:01:05] he did not become a sinner they are full
[1:01:09] come on only because
[1:01:11] he knew who he was
[1:01:15] he knew he was the son of God
[1:01:18] he knew he was the word of God
[1:01:24] and therefore the devil tempted him
[1:01:28] because Jesus was able and could be able
[1:01:32] to sin
[1:01:35] but he did not because he knew who he
[1:01:38] was and that's the only the reason why
[1:01:41] Jesus came because
[1:01:44] the children of God
[1:01:47] because they have not realized who they
[1:01:50] are
[1:01:51] right and that's why when Jesus came on
[1:01:56] he always Associated himself with
[1:01:58] Sinners
[1:02:01] because he knew they did not know who
[1:02:04] they are
[1:02:06] he knew the moment he goes around them
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:11] will make them come to themselves
[1:02:16] I am not supposed to be a sinner
[1:02:20] I believe the word of God
[1:02:24] and the moment I believe Jesus
[1:02:50] Christ
[1:02:52] [Music]

[1:03:46] God
[1:03:50] if we can only know who we are true the
[1:03:54] devil cannot overcome users
[1:04:02] as many as received
[1:04:04] himself
[1:04:06] [Music]

[1:11:24] that's the only reason why we preach
[1:11:25] area that's the reason why we print
[1:11:28] books
[1:11:30] that's the reason why we go for
[1:11:31] evangelism
[1:11:33] that's the reason why we start a church
[1:11:35] and put chairs for people to come yes
[1:11:39] that's what we do we record our services
[1:11:45] that's why we do everything we do
[1:11:48] we are trying to create an atmosphere
[1:11:51] because I could take to invite a sinner
[1:11:54] it does not be like the Pharisees
[1:12:01] for this Fellowship is that we will have
[1:12:05] a heart that Christ Jesus had
[1:12:08] Christopher Arena a heart of knowing
[1:12:11] that he was a sinner's friend
[1:12:15] and that for him he was always
[1:12:17] attracting Sinners

[1:20:31] praise the name of the Lord
[1:20:37] foreign
[1:20:54] Don't Preach to condemn problem
[1:20:58] and I'll show you examples here of Our
[1:21:02] Lord you know I used to be in a church
[1:21:05] somewhere
[1:21:07] where there was a a brother preaching
[1:21:12] another this is the mindset of many
[1:21:14] people who believe the message
[1:21:17] because of the way it has been presented
[1:21:22] you know and you know whenever you would
[1:21:24] see a woman coming in
[1:21:27] wearing a trousers
[1:21:38] that's not the kind of gospel
[1:21:41] we do not preach to condemn
[1:21:44] we preach to save
[1:21:47] and listen if when we preach
[1:21:50] they don't get changed then we are not
[1:21:54] preaching to begin with
[1:21:59] do you understand what I'm talking about
[1:22:01] if when we preach
[1:22:04] they don't get changed then what we are
[1:22:07] preaching is not the word
[1:22:11] and if what we preach
[1:22:16] is forcing them to change
[1:22:20] can make them do things we have not
[1:22:24] preached the word foreign
[1:23:01] you've been eating things
[1:23:21] but actually God is looking at your
[1:23:24] house
[1:23:31] that's what I'm saying number if we
[1:23:34] preach
[1:23:46] Everlasting effects
[1:23:48] [Music]
[1:23:54] because
[1:23:56] why do I preach to you
[1:23:58] because when that morning of the Rapture
[1:24:01] comes
[1:24:05] [Music]
[1:24:08] sister about our society
[1:24:12] it's about a Rapture
[1:24:16] if the Lord
[1:24:19] a very good sister dressing very well
[1:24:23] oh everybody says
[1:24:32] and we have many of such young ladies
[1:24:38] in charge that claim to preach this
[1:24:40] message
[1:24:43] very well dressed
[1:24:46] [Music]
[1:24:55] guys we have such me younger men there
[1:25:00] their hearts have never changed
[1:25:02] listen to me this message if we feed on
[1:25:07] it listen we have the bible let us read
[1:25:11] it
[1:25:13] let us feed our need to GDA we have the
[1:25:16] message
[1:25:22] let us listen
[1:25:25] don't you worry about what you have
[1:25:28] right around you get the fire of your
[1:25:30] inner worry just feed on that one
[1:25:33] there is power in that world
[1:25:38] and make you what you never thought you
[1:25:41] would be good
[1:25:44] I mean this is what we need because
[1:25:47] Jesus is a sinner's friend
[1:25:51] Jesus is your friend this morning
[1:25:55] Hallelujah
[1:25:57] and then you have a lot of young people
[1:26:01] living so immorally
[1:26:09] if God was to put a camera there
[1:26:14] a screen
[1:26:16] and put a second life of everybody there
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:21] I wonder how many would sit here
[1:26:23] comfortably
[1:26:28] if you feel you might be comfortable
[1:26:32] it's time for you to make a decision
[1:26:35] are you going to continue being a
[1:26:37] Pharisees
[1:26:38] or are you going to have the heart of
[1:26:40] Christ
[1:26:42] therefore disease we are quick to
[1:26:44] condemn others
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:47] but they themselves
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:56] I remember and I always gave this
[1:26:58] testimony
[1:26:59] I was with my wife
[1:27:03] and this year already came you know
[1:27:06] somebody told us oh I'm going to bring
[1:27:07] this woman you know she will believe
[1:27:08] this the message
[1:27:13] actually that is the day my mindset
[1:27:16] changed
[1:27:19] as he was talking about
[1:27:23] I was seeing a very well dressed
[1:27:36] but as I was in my room with my wife
[1:27:41] with this brother no no
[1:27:45] she walked in
[1:27:47] as soon as I looked at her
[1:27:49] [Music]
[1:27:51] I started the Judgment Trends
[1:27:56] now he even wasted my time
[1:28:00] how can he bring me a prostitute
[1:28:03] these messages for people who are
[1:28:05] somewhere
[1:28:07] at least if they are like maybe
[1:28:09] Pentecost or something they just you
[1:28:11] know preach to them and then they
[1:28:12] believe
[1:28:17] I don't believe that anymore
[1:28:21] because I believe this this is not to do
[1:28:25] to help us to personalize easily
[1:28:30] um
[1:28:35] put them from their Church to our church
[1:28:39] but for somebody who is drinking or
[1:28:41] smoking
[1:28:43] a prostitute kind of science
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:28:59] you're powerless
[1:29:01] is this message
[1:29:07] is it Christopher
[1:29:10] can you change
[1:29:12] does it have power

[1:29:27] foreign
[1:30:03] oh
[1:30:11] I don't know what my wife thoughts
[1:30:13] but in a moment maybe

[1:30:25] I realized she was praying the whole
[1:30:28] time
[1:30:29] I don't know what she was praying but
[1:30:32] maybe she was praying oh God this is big
[1:30:34] or whatever
[1:30:37] she went to pray and why because it was
[1:30:41] one room you know and so and then I I
[1:30:45] was very bit of preaching to us but I
[1:30:48] was even preaching fearing now
[1:30:50] whatever I will talk about
[1:30:53] she will think I'm attacking her guys
[1:30:56] so I was just trying to pick a little
[1:30:58] here
[1:31:01] and then she realized what I was trying
[1:31:03] to do
[1:31:06] she stopped me oh I love that sister she
[1:31:11] changed my mindset forever yeah

[1:35:26] thrown all everything that I have yeah
[1:35:31] and I watched God transform my life

[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:05] let me tell you when I come to the
[1:38:07] message
[1:38:08] one thing that attracted me
[1:38:15] sometimes new people come around here
[1:38:17] around to have a pill remove and I watch
[1:38:20] Believers and I Marvel named
[1:38:24] you find brothers and sisters and
[1:38:26] talking to one another because they know
[1:38:28] one another
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:31] and they leave the new people to stand
[1:38:33] there standing
[1:38:34] down we need to have the heart of God
[1:38:39] when you see a new younger sister a new
[1:38:42] younger brother
[1:38:45] don't wait for the pastor to go to them
[1:38:49] sister Brothers
[1:38:51] [Applause]
[1:39:24] not what they have if they're the seed
[1:39:26] of God they need it
[1:39:31] praise praise the name of God what they
[1:39:35] have they need it
[1:39:38] what we have they needed
[1:39:44] his unfailing words of Promise
[1:39:48] he says the word always corrects the era
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:54] how many Believers
[1:39:57] the word always correct
[1:40:03] [Applause]
[1:40:08] shot
[1:40:17] shots
[1:40:20] but I I had one brother pushing and
[1:40:23] ready to court somewhere
[1:40:36] I will not do it again
[1:40:43] in the supermarkets
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:40:55] you know they're like
[1:40:58] many legs are like iron Buzz so you take
[1:41:03] your eye on the bus in a shot
[1:41:09] you know
[1:41:11] I didn't know it was wrong until I had
[1:41:14] it in the message
[1:41:18] and many of you have heard many things
[1:41:20] that you didn't know were wrong
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:31] you do not need to do that
[1:41:34] because the word corrects
[1:41:39] as a child of God
[1:41:42] you will be corrected
[1:41:46] the word always
[1:41:49] and if people could only see it today
[1:41:58] so sometimes you may even want to
[1:42:01] correct somebody or you cannot back home
[1:42:03] even before you bring them to the church
[1:42:11] you have to dress the way we address
[1:42:17] again
[1:42:27] don't worry
[1:42:38] are this my words
[1:42:42] why would you come to church alone
[1:42:46] meet somebody on Saturday
[1:42:49] appoint them
[1:42:51] foreign
[1:43:57] hallelujah hallelujah the time of the
[1:44:00] hour now we know these things are true
[1:44:04] so no matter how great the era might
[1:44:07] seem to be
[1:44:09] yeah the word always corrects
[1:44:14] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:44:19] how many love the Lord
[1:44:24] let me tell you if this mind is in us
[1:44:29] God is going to do exploits
[1:44:33] with us
[1:44:37] with you again
[1:44:42] you young ladies
[1:44:48] see God wants to do exploits with us
[1:44:51] but this will not work
[1:44:54] if you don't have that mind you
[1:44:59] and that I met several scriptures I
[1:45:01] wanted to show you here
[1:45:04] on how Christ was a sinner's friend
[1:45:08] but I'll read one and then I'll leave
[1:45:11] the two or three for another service
[1:45:24] and one of the verses desired him that
[1:45:27] he would eat with him and he went into
[1:45:29] the Pharisees house and sat down to meet
[1:45:31] and behold a woman in the city which was
[1:45:33] a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at
[1:45:35] meat in the Pharisees house brought an
[1:45:37] alabaster box of the ointment and stood
[1:45:40] At His Feet behind him weeping and began
[1:45:42] to wash his feet with tears and did wipe
[1:45:45] them behind uh wipe them with the hairs
[1:45:49] of her head and kissed his feet and
[1:45:51] anointed them with ointment now where
[1:45:54] the Pharisee which had Biden him saw it
[1:45:57] he spoke with within himself saying this
[1:46:01] man if he were a prophet would have
[1:46:03] known who and what manner of woman this
[1:46:06] is that touches her for she is a sinner
[1:46:11] and and Jesus answering say that to him
[1:46:14] Simon I have somewhere to say unto thee
[1:46:18] and and he said unto the master say on
[1:46:21] there was a certain creditor which had
[1:46:23] to date us the one owed 500 Pence and
[1:46:26] the other 50. and when they had nothing
[1:46:29] to pay he frankly forgive them both tell
[1:46:32] me the offer which of them will love him
[1:46:35] most Simon answered and said I suppose
[1:46:37] that he to whom he forgive most and he
[1:46:41] said unto him thou has rightfully judged
[1:46:45] and he turned to the woman and he said
[1:46:48] unto
[1:46:49] Simon Says now this woman
[1:46:52] I entered into the house thou gavest me
[1:46:54] no water for my feet but she has washed
[1:46:57] my feet with tears and wiped them with
[1:47:00] the hairs of my head
[1:47:02] God gave us me no kiss
[1:47:04] but this woman since the time I came in
[1:47:07] has not ceased to kiss my feet
[1:47:10] my head with oil
[1:47:12] thou didst not anoint but this Uber The
[1:47:16] Sinner
[1:47:17] has anointed my faith with ointment
[1:47:19] wherever I say unto thee her sins which
[1:47:23] are many are forgiven
[1:47:26] for she loved the match
[1:47:28] but to whom little Is Forgiven the same
[1:47:31] life is really tall
[1:47:33] and he said unto her thy sins are
[1:47:36] forgiven and they sat at meat with him
[1:47:39] began to say within themselves who is
[1:47:42] this that forgiveth sins also and he
[1:47:45] said unto the woman thy faith has saved
[1:47:49] thee go in peace
[1:47:52] Amina praise the name of the Lord now
[1:47:55] you have heard the scripture
[1:47:58] I believe it's

[1:50:20] Simon thought I don't need this Jesus as
[1:50:22] much
[1:50:40] but I will not shower his feet
[1:50:43] I will not clean his face
[1:50:46] because I don't really need him to be
[1:50:48] safe
[1:50:51] the man did not realize that
[1:50:54] you did not realize that they needed
[1:50:56] this Jesus
[1:50:58] because he realized he didn't have a lot
[1:51:00] of
[1:51:24] and she started to immediately she
[1:51:27] didn't even talk with Jesus
[1:51:30] the person knew she was
[1:51:40] the name of the Lord I mean there's
[1:51:42] another one here but this woman then
[1:51:44] came immediately
[1:51:46] she came right to the feet of Jesus
[1:51:57] was washing the feet of Jesus
[1:52:10] to clean it
[1:52:14] and this woman the Pharisee um
[1:52:18] the one who knew he did not have a lot
[1:52:20] of sins
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:24] he looked at Jesus
[1:52:29] this is not in order
[1:52:31] and you know Jesus
[1:52:33] Simon was not talking
[1:52:36] it was in his heart
[1:52:39] God knows our hearts
[1:52:42] our thoughts
[1:52:45] [Music]
[1:52:47] and Jesus looked at her
[1:52:51] and he said Simon I want to teach you
[1:52:54] something
[1:52:55] so there was a man
[1:52:58] said who had two people that were his
[1:53:00] debtors
[1:53:07] and one of the of them owed him 500
[1:53:11] Pence
[1:53:15] and
[1:53:18] he said
[1:53:21] they were all not having enough to pay
[1:53:24] now before we continue
[1:53:28] this Simon Simon looked at Jesus
[1:53:33] foreign
[1:53:40] Simon looked at Jesus
[1:53:44] and he said what I wish he knew
[1:53:48] what type of woman this woman is
[1:53:56] a sinner
[1:53:58] was he right
[1:54:04] yes he was right
[1:54:05] that's true the truth
[1:54:08] it is true
[1:54:10] but he thought Jesus did not know
[1:54:16] did he know yes
[1:54:19] all right now cut
[1:54:22] and Jesus when he goes to teach time yes
[1:54:25] let me give you this story Simon yeah
[1:54:30] who had two
[1:54:33] creditors
[1:54:50] who do you think that woman was
[1:54:55] foreign
[1:55:02] [Music]
[1:55:32] and at that moment he said he said to
[1:55:35] her
[1:55:37] the man the people couldn't pay
[1:55:41] um
[1:55:41] and he forgive them both and they said
[1:55:45] what do you think
[1:55:47] he was more grateful yeah
[1:55:51] and and Simon says the one who was
[1:55:54] forgiving man
[1:55:57] and Jesus told him a lesson here
[1:56:00] he says you have right here
[1:56:12] [Music]
[1:56:25] [Music]
[1:56:33] foreign you did not kiss me telling you
[1:56:37] again but this woman has been kissing me

[1:57:06] are forgiven foreign
[1:57:18] [Music]
[1:57:44] foreign
[1:58:13] foreign
[1:58:21] and he's right Adam because so many of
[1:58:25] the Believers
[1:58:26] they are like this Pharisees
[1:58:33] who feel the righteous
[1:58:37] they don't need to worship Allah
[1:58:40] and that's why when you go among the
[1:58:42] Pentecostals
[1:58:50] but they have praise
[1:58:53] um why but because they know they're
[1:58:57] like this woman
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:01] but may God help us we may never ever
[1:59:04] feel like this Simon today
