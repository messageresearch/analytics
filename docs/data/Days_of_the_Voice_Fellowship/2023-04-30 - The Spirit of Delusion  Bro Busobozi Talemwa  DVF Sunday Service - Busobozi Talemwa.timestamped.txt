[56:25] not the love of the truth that they
[56:26] might be saved
[56:29] and for this cause God shall send them
[56:32] strong delusion that they should believe
[56:34] a lie that they all might be damned who

[1:00:31] you see the spirit of delusion
[1:00:34] is a very cunning spirit
[1:00:36] is a very stubborn Spirit
[1:00:40] you see if I try to look into the
[1:00:43] dictionary
[1:00:46] to try and find the meaning of the word
[1:00:49] foreign
[1:01:10] foreign
[1:01:23] Ty held despite the in court travertable
[1:01:28] evidence to the contrary occurring
[1:01:31] especially in mental conditions
[1:01:36] a
[1:01:37] beliefs that someone holds
[1:01:40] and is convinced this is true
[1:01:44] despite
[1:01:49] here he says they incontrovertible you
[1:01:52] know they despite the
[1:01:55] the
[1:01:57] explanations
[1:02:06] you tell him this is
[1:02:12] white he is
[1:02:17] what he thinks is right
[1:02:20] you will show him evidence
[1:02:23] you will show him evidence infallible
[1:02:26] evidence
[1:02:28] you will prove to him Beyond reasonable
[1:02:34] that was what you are telling him is
[1:02:40] what I know is what is Right Church
[1:02:43] truth now that is the spirit
[1:02:46] and it's uh called delusion
[1:02:50] and mostly it is in mental cases
[1:02:55] Obama
[1:03:36] oh I am Trump
[1:03:40] I'm the president of America
[1:03:42] oh I am 70.7 and you can't convince him
[1:03:46] otherwise
[1:03:47] jump for you to talk to him you need to
[1:03:51] salute to him
[1:03:59] now it's a condition it's a mental
[1:04:03] condition
[1:04:04] you know according to
[1:04:07] um medicine
[1:04:08] according to the Bible Bible is a spirit
[1:04:13] is a spirit for you and it's called
[1:04:16] delusion
[1:04:18] not everyone gets this listen listen
[1:04:21] church not everyone gets the spirit of
[1:04:23] delusions
[1:04:25] but those who get the spirit of the
[1:04:28] illusion get it this way
[1:04:31] God gives you the truth
[1:04:34] hallelujah man but when you say the
[1:04:38] truth
[1:04:39] you do not get to appreciate it
[1:05:01] so it comes only after rejecting the
[1:05:05] truth
[1:05:07] and that's why Believers of the word all
[1:05:10] over the world
[1:05:13] I love us of the truth
[1:05:16] you must always be a lover of the truth
[1:05:20] and I say what is the truth
[1:05:24] Jesus Christ is the true yes sugar
[1:05:27] mashima he said I am the way I am the
[1:05:30] truth
[1:05:32] no man can come to the father
[1:05:37] Jesus yes he's not here physically
[1:05:40] where is Jesus
[1:05:48] is not a textbook
[1:05:52] we have a lot of books that people call
[1:05:56] us textbooks or reference books or
[1:05:58] something like that
[1:06:00] those of you who have gone to University
[1:06:05] a lot of reference books
[1:06:09] this one here is more than just a
[1:06:12] reference
[1:06:14] this one is the book foreign
[1:06:41] [Applause]
[1:07:09] and Beyond this one
[1:07:12] there is
[1:07:15] the name of the Lord
[1:07:18] Hallelujah
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:24] this word is what we believe us believe
[1:07:29] and anyone who doesn't believe this
[1:07:33] I think you need to bring it down a
[1:07:34] little bit it's vibrating anyone who
[1:07:35] doesn't bring anyone who doesn't believe
[1:07:37] this word
[1:07:42] God
[1:07:43] will accept certain spirits
[1:07:47] to come and attack them
[1:07:52] and these spirits will be very strong
[1:07:56] that you can almost not break them
[1:07:59] it's called illusion
[1:08:02] people will start believing lies
[1:08:09] they will not actually know that they
[1:08:12] are believing lies
[1:08:14] that's what I want to prove to you this
[1:08:16] morning
[1:08:20] but the devil has tried to bring
[1:08:23] and you will see actually by the end of
[1:08:26] the service
[1:08:29] there are so many people deceived
[1:08:32] and they almost can't believe it is
[1:08:41] from the God of this evil age
[1:08:48] the spirit of delusion
[1:08:50] is of the devil
[1:08:54] there was now working in the children of
[1:08:56] disobedience
[1:09:08] at the beginning they are disobedient to
[1:09:11] the true word of God
[1:09:14] that's right
[1:09:17] they are disobedient to the true word of
[1:09:19] God
[1:09:21] the word of God is
[1:09:26] the Bible says when any man comes to God
[1:09:30] first you must believe that he is
[1:09:35] a rewarder of all those are diligently
[1:09:37] Seekers
[1:09:47] to follow whatever he tells you
[1:09:50] believe whatever he tells us don't come
[1:09:54] to go to the bed
[1:09:55] don't come to God to give him your
[1:09:58] opinion
[1:09:59] you don't come to God to suggest to him
[1:10:02] so what do you think you should do
[1:10:05] what do you think he should have done
[1:10:07] but when you come to God
[1:10:10] he wants you
[1:10:12] to submit to everyone
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:41] just cause a disbelief
[1:10:47] contention and their questions
[1:10:51] meant to desire knowledge
[1:10:54] but whoever needs knowledge of wisdom
[1:10:59] the Bible says God gives it
[1:11:02] if you have a clean heart if you have an
[1:11:06] opinion
[1:11:09] God will answer all your questions
[1:11:12] but when you come and you don't
[1:11:15] understand a few things
[1:11:17] together
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:26] am I talking to someone here
[1:11:29] you are going to heaven again on the
[1:11:32] blessings that you believe the whole
[1:11:33] world
[1:11:36] I may not understand everything here
[1:11:40] I tell you this I believe everything is
[1:11:57] what you don't understand
[1:12:00] there's a problem there's a there's a
[1:12:02] question I have

[1:50:53] can't tell them they are not beautiful
[1:50:56] and tell them I should look like other
[1:50:59] creatures
[1:51:01] say this beautiful supposedly beautiful
[1:51:03] woman
[1:51:05] trying to mimic the spirit of a cat
[1:51:12] deceiving
[1:51:38] the women in our generation

[1:52:25] foreign
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:43] [Music]
[1:52:58] from that day you should you should be
[1:53:01] called names
[1:53:05] even they do these things because
[1:53:07] they feel their cats
[1:53:09] they live among cards
[1:53:16] if you come to them and tell them
[1:53:22] she will go to court
[1:53:25] this one called me a Humanity
[1:53:32] foreign
[1:53:59] foreign
[1:54:15] some people people
[1:54:17] and I've been asked this question many
[1:54:20] times
[1:54:22] is there a fashion that every believer
[1:54:24] should do
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:27] no I don't believe there is a uniform
[1:54:30] fashion secret is
[1:54:32] here
[1:54:36] the only scripture is
[1:54:43] it now you are telling me telling us we
[1:54:47] should appreciate nature together
[1:55:04] [Music]
[1:55:08] now the question is
[1:55:17] a young man I was within Zimbabwe I
[1:55:21] thought he had put some stuff foreign
[1:56:00] foreign
[1:56:37] keep your hair and very much like yours
[1:56:40] yes be yourself better Charlie be you
[1:56:44] better don't copy somebody else don't
[1:56:47] copy the Fashions of the world so you
[1:56:50] could be after others
[1:56:55] you understand what I'm saying be
[1:56:57] yourself
[1:57:06] that is okay
[1:57:09] some people
[1:57:11] naturally they they have a bald head
[1:57:15] body
[1:57:21] and they love teachings
[1:57:26] you're not the message
[1:57:41] foreign
[1:57:46] and Naturally Speaking
[1:57:49] they love cutting it
[1:57:52] naturally
[1:57:55] they like having nothing
[1:57:59] so they try to embed that in the message
[1:58:03] so when a brother raises
[1:58:15] to feel
[1:59:11] [Music]
[1:59:15] they want to be like foreign
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:31] there's a balance you have to strike
[1:59:36] give me the next slide
[1:59:40] see this one now
[1:59:43] what do you see
[1:59:46] God has naturally created a monkey with
[1:59:49] its own
[1:59:52] lipsticks
[1:59:55] and you find women
[2:00:03] to go and want to be like monkeys
[2:00:09] get their lips
[2:00:17] I even don't know the men that matter
[2:00:19] these kind of videos
[2:00:22] how they think yeah
[2:00:27] foreign now
[2:00:30] you might not like it
[2:00:33] but if the word says it
[2:00:36] if the word shows us the way and we are
[2:00:39] following the World Series
[2:00:46] God has gathered nature
[2:00:49] let me put it this way there are even
[2:00:52] some things what do you need to we don't
[2:00:54] need the word the Bible the words to
[2:00:57] tell us
[2:00:59] what I'm preaching today that's why I'm
[2:01:02] not even reading too much scriptures
[2:01:06] the Bible says doesn't even nature
[2:01:10] itself teach you
[2:01:13] foreign
[2:01:38] go back to the last one go back to it
[2:01:41] go back together yes now see this one
[2:01:45] and you find boys
[2:01:48] rushing to love girls
[2:01:52] and then you expect a woman with those
[2:01:54] kind of things to raise your children
[2:01:58] in the fear of God
[2:02:04] you are also deceived
[2:02:12] you think you will have the family that
[2:02:14] he wants to
[2:02:17] whatever is inspiring
[2:02:20] she's trying to copy this
[2:02:23] and you will find that the spirit of
[2:02:25] this
[2:02:26] it might even be the one ruling
[2:02:33] look at the next the next one
[2:02:37] I'm seeing my time is up so let me let
[2:02:39] me try to wind up now look at this
[2:02:43] laughs are you here
[2:02:48] you say what is that pasta It's just
[2:02:49] shoes
[2:02:51] this is not just shoes
[2:02:54] whoever made it and whoever buys it has
[2:02:58] a at the speed of delusions
[2:03:00] to try and copy the other one
[2:03:06] is not good enough you should have feet
[2:03:09] like like the hoofs over of a horse
[2:03:14] so they will buy these ones
[2:03:16] and they will begin walking
[2:03:20] foreign
[2:03:45] foreign
[2:04:02] I I had to put this picture so you can
[2:04:04] be confused
[2:04:06] let me ask what is that
[2:04:11] what is this
[2:04:15] you see others yeah this is a snake
[2:04:19] right
[2:04:24] actually this is a man with a tattoo
[2:04:41] very very nice looking
[2:04:43] but we are not called to take up those
[2:04:46] kind of to mimic something
[2:04:50] so why that's why the Bible does not
[2:04:52] allow people to use tattoos
[2:04:55] but that was the Lord
[2:04:59] rejecting the truth and then they go for
[2:05:03] this
[2:05:04] they are not happy with what God has
[2:05:06] made them everybody
[2:05:09] that's your answer
[2:05:11] that's why they do tattoos
[2:05:14] because they are deluded
[2:05:18] Satan to want what they are not
[2:05:22] and you find out everywhere
[2:05:28] you may not have tattoos but if you
[2:05:32] don't appreciate yourself
[2:05:34] you are not different from a man that is
[2:05:42] everyone
[2:06:33] um
[2:06:38] and then the devil will give you all up
[2:06:40] standing now
[2:06:42] but if you take God this way
[2:06:45] there's something that the father has
[2:06:47] not planted in you
[2:06:50] come he will approach it out I bet you
[2:06:52] could jump if it's a sickness that is
[2:06:55] making you tiny God and God Alone
[2:07:00] even if the sin is making you fat
[2:07:05] and then you go and see yourself
[2:07:08] this is
[2:07:18] show all these younger man is
[2:07:25] about to get married
[2:07:31] I will not get tired
[2:07:42] who told you that the white are the one
[2:07:45] who are beautiful
[2:07:55] amen Brothers
[2:07:57] amen Brothers
[2:08:00] a a good man will look for character not
[2:08:02] skin color or massage
[2:08:10] Pastor when you're preaching to us you
[2:08:14] are telling us that we should not look
[2:08:15] for beauty
[2:08:20] [Laughter]
[2:08:23] lies in the hands of the beholders
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:27] sister
[2:08:34] and when they come for you
[2:08:38] when the white ones
[2:08:41] will not take them away
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:51] hallelujah amen praise the name of the
[2:08:54] Lord give me the next slide
[2:08:57] next slide have you seen that what's the
[2:09:02] difference
[2:09:03] is the similarities
[2:09:06] you find a woman
[2:09:10] trying to mimic an ego
[2:09:13] you find them with all those longer
[2:09:15] nails
[2:09:18] like what you see there
[2:09:20] see God gave an eagle
[2:09:24] such Nails
[2:09:26] in order for it to get its praise
[2:09:30] you don't need actually sister with
[2:09:33] those kind of nails you can't even eat
[2:09:37] if you eat you can easily become sick
[2:09:41] I wonder how they even keep hygiene with
[2:09:43] us
[2:09:49] and the devil is destroying a generation
[2:09:59] I say we as Believers of this world
[2:10:02] let us stay above these Spirits
[2:10:11] for we cannot be overtaken by them
[2:10:14] praise the name of the Lord
[2:10:18] living a life
[2:10:20] you can now decide what general they
[2:10:23] want to be
[2:10:24] somebody
[2:10:27] it comes from what we have been saying
[2:10:30] how can a good understanding man or
[2:10:34] massage
[2:10:40] to believe they are a woman
[2:10:42] how can a sober woman
[2:11:00] what God intended for them
[2:11:05] and you find them
[2:11:08] listen church because I'm reaching my
[2:11:10] climax when we get done with this
[2:11:15] getting posters
[2:11:18] foreign
[2:11:34] foreign
[2:11:51] [Music]
[2:12:03] when I was in South Africa I told the
[2:12:06] people you see because in South Africa
[2:12:08] they're like almost in the US
[2:12:15] but in Uganda we think yeah we are still
[2:12:17] okay
[2:12:18] but let me tell you we are not okay
[2:12:33] there is
[2:12:37] absence
[2:12:42] they themselves
[2:12:46] why watch because this is their Heritage
[2:12:52] before the bread comes down they're
[2:12:55] going to take the take over the whole
[2:12:57] world um
[2:13:01] they're the ones with the money sister
[2:13:49] foreign
[2:14:09] [Music]
[2:14:17] he is he is interested to pervert their
[2:14:22] minds
[2:14:26] even in school
[2:14:28] children their mind will become
[2:14:31] perverted
[2:14:33] in our society
[2:14:42] that's why he told women to wear
[2:14:45] trousers
[2:14:47] so that they can think their men
[2:14:49] you thought in the beginning it was a
[2:14:51] style because
[2:14:55] there is a wrong speed behind it
[2:15:00] started by saying women have rights
[2:15:04] and then finally they say yeah
[2:15:10] is the spirit of delusion
[2:15:13] and it's the Looting the whole
[2:15:15] generation
[2:15:16] listen to me no one will survive okay
[2:15:21] that have the mark of Christ
[2:15:34] is the only thing that will make us
[2:15:38] the spirit of delusion
[2:15:41] mankind you can now decide whether they
[2:15:43] are a cow a monkey a donkey a lizard or
[2:15:45] something
[2:15:48] [Music]
[2:15:48] um
[2:15:52] someone saying for me I've discovered
[2:15:55] that since I was born I'm feeling uh
[2:15:59] like a monkey

[2:16:32] in the world
[2:16:35] it's a strong delusion is
[2:16:45] imagine terrorism
[2:16:47] I'm going to nail this properly
[2:16:54] Generations
[2:17:02] as long as they have consented
[2:17:06] so whether we are married or not um
[2:17:22] you have no rights
[2:17:25] kissing a man a woman who is not your
[2:17:27] husband or wife
[2:17:31] you have no rights sleeping with someone
[2:17:35] else's wife
[2:17:36] because whoever is not yet married
[2:17:40] wife or husband
[2:17:47] someone else is theirs
[2:17:49] and if you are the one don't marry them
[2:17:53] the Bible says to you young men and
[2:17:56] women
[2:17:57] if you burn boom
[2:18:02] what's up
[2:18:05] that is the Bible solution Bible
[2:18:10] that's why Rwanda married
[2:18:15] foreign
[2:18:32] [Music]
[2:18:36] no brother this is the word
[2:18:40] so you find a pasta
[2:18:47] that's why you hear the stories
[2:18:51] that's why here days of the voice
[2:19:01] sisters alone
[2:19:10] you have no business
[2:19:13] we believe in Holiness
[2:19:20] it is not the same tomorrow
[2:19:27] you
[2:19:34] will build our society
[2:19:36] [Music]
[2:19:45] think about marriage
[2:19:48] think about foreign
[2:20:07] I don't believe that they're just
[2:20:09] chicken I don't believe that but Pastor
[2:20:12] you're not married
[2:20:18] that we should take the word the way it
[2:20:20] is
[2:20:23] [Music]
[2:20:27] the Bible says
[2:20:31] I don't believe
[2:20:33] that kind of thing two mature adults can
[2:20:35] decide to do anything else
[2:20:43] tell somebody that's alive
[2:20:48] you see they say anybody can believe
[2:20:50] whatever they like
[2:20:52] as long as they believe it they are
[2:20:55] right no that's a lie baptism baptizing
[2:20:59] babies he's alive
[2:21:01] no matter how many people do it
[2:21:03] baptizing babies I say this is
[2:21:14] for there is only one baptism of water
[2:21:20] um
[2:21:26] now the Bible says any other thing is a
[2:21:30] lie of the devil
[2:21:31] Guru
[2:22:07] all right I have two more slides now
[2:22:08] okay of two scriptures
[2:22:11] Romans 1 21.
[2:22:14] because that when they knew God
[2:22:17] they glorified him not as God neither we
[2:22:19] are thankful but became vain in their
[2:22:21] own imaginations
[2:22:23] and their foolish Hearts heart was
[2:22:25] darkened professing themselves to be
[2:22:27] wise they became fools
[2:22:41] [Music]
[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:22:53] the professor they profess to be wise
[2:22:56] and the Bible says they became fools
[2:22:59] brother
[2:23:20] foreign and they begin you know you know
[2:23:24] it's all right to have those nails
[2:23:30] [Music]
[2:23:31] they profess to be wise
[2:23:33] but they became full Neighbors
[2:23:39] you see why am I preaching this
[2:23:41] because we
[2:23:44] have a responsibility
[2:23:46] to tell you these things
[2:23:51] it's a it's a responsibility given to us
[2:23:53] by God
[2:23:56] the spirit of delusions
[2:24:02] taking over mothers
[2:24:08] and and people are becoming fools
[2:24:14] and it says their foolish Hearts was
[2:24:16] taken away imagination
[2:24:24] could take
[2:24:32] here is what it is Lord we have sinned
[2:24:35] all night and taken nothing nevertheless
[2:24:38] at Thy word
[2:24:40] is
[2:24:48] there you are
[2:25:26] with faith believing that God would
[2:25:29] fulfill his word faith would put some
[2:25:31] there singer
[2:25:33] yeah
[2:25:41] I want to finish with this church
[2:25:44] Hallelujah man we are believers
[2:25:47] we are like Peter throwing a pet I said
[2:25:50] we are believers tell somebody
[2:25:54] Hallelujah
[2:25:57] if we believe I tell your neighbor I'm a
[2:25:59] Believer
[2:26:01] don't worry just keep it wrong
[2:26:10] and when Peter had what Jesus said
[2:26:16] he said we have been cast
[2:26:25] because
[2:26:37] if there was no fish
[2:26:42] God would have put fish there
[2:27:42] who can do all things
[2:27:44] the Bible says I am fearful
[2:27:56] I can do
[2:28:25] do you know
[2:28:27] if there is no jobs for you God can make
[2:28:29] you create some jobs even for others
[2:28:38] the God of this message
[2:28:45] he specializes
[2:28:52] he is not looking for possibilities to
[2:28:56] accomplish what he is saying
[2:28:59] he is looking for believers those who
[2:29:03] believe what he says
[2:29:19] it is now time
[2:29:23] [Applause]
[2:29:27] while I'm speaking that I'm having many
[2:29:30] Revelations which I can't even imagine
[2:29:31] Hallelujah
[2:29:36] it is time rather begin playing
[2:29:38] something come on musicians which is
[2:29:40] time Church you know our vision of
[2:29:42] course welcome to be accomplished if you
[2:29:46] stick in the world
[2:29:49] which I said in the beginning
[2:29:52] if you stick in the naturals
[2:29:58] is going to be natural enough
[2:30:04] because the God of this message
[2:30:09] what he has done for others he can do
[2:30:12] for you what is impossible
[2:30:17] that man cannot do it
[2:30:20] that's why we are believers

[2:31:00] believe with me right now I want you to
[2:31:02] believe with me right now God is able to
[2:31:05] take it
[2:31:07] because you believe the truth
[2:31:10] he will not bring the spirit of delusion
[2:31:12] to you
