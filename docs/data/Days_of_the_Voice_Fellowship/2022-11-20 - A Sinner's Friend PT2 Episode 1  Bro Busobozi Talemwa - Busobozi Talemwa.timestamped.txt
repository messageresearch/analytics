[1:05:37] Nairobi on Monday the Lord willing

[1:05:53] and this morning
[1:06:03] Jesus love
[1:06:05] can make the violence
[1:06:11] and then God LED Brother Martin to sing
[1:06:13] such love
[1:06:16] God
[1:06:23] Was preparing us for the message
[1:06:26] so this is really to confirm to me that
[1:06:29] the Lord is in this
[1:06:31] and on the Outreach we did on Sunday but
[1:06:49] and this morning I'm happy to see him
[1:06:52] here
[1:07:01] [Applause]
[1:07:05] and I know there are many people who are
[1:07:07] asking about women preachers go ahead
[1:07:09] and many other subjects that we touched
[1:07:12] on many events
[1:07:21] so this Sunday I'm coming to I'm coming
[1:07:24] back to congruent very well
[1:07:32] have some time to spare today at 5 PM
[1:07:34] please come out in balwa center
[1:07:39] and I believe that the Lord will bless
[1:07:42] you as you bless those who need God
[1:07:51] have you prayed for the service this
[1:07:52] morning
[1:07:56] those who prayed God bless you
[1:07:58] I'd like you to take your Bible and let
[1:08:01] us go to the Book of Luke chapter 7.
[1:08:08] that's this is the most important part
[1:08:10] of the service
[1:08:14] we can sing we can pray we can do
[1:08:17] everything but while we are here on
[1:08:19] Earth we need the word more than
[1:08:20] anything
[1:08:21] foreign
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:51] the son of man verse 34 the son of man
[1:08:55] is come eating and drinking and he say
[1:08:58] Behold a gluttonous man and a wine
[1:09:01] Bieber a friend of publicans and sinners
[1:09:15] foreign
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:10:03] [Music]
[1:10:41] foreign
[1:10:51] but some have actually even thought
[1:10:54] there is no longer Grace for Sinners
[1:11:03] dried up even their hunger and thirst
[1:11:06] for to pray for the Sinners is no longer
[1:11:10] there
[1:11:11] is
[1:11:14] no longer go out to do Outreach on the
[1:11:17] on the road
[1:11:19] they no longer give our tracks to
[1:11:22] somebody
[1:11:24] they no longer tell their friends about
[1:11:27] what God has done for them
[1:11:30] because some believe that the door for
[1:11:34] Grace is close
[1:11:39] and even in their churches
[1:11:42] the moment someone does something wrong
[1:11:45] or bad
[1:11:47] they will kick them out
[1:11:57] as if it were that we actually were a
[1:12:00] Catholic priest joining defects
[1:12:03] but we find that such things are nowhere
[1:12:06] in the Bible
[1:12:09] and that you know people have taken
[1:12:12] Traditions
[1:12:14] when something is done over and over and
[1:12:18] over again
[1:12:21] it becomes gospel truth
[1:12:25] and it replaces the word of God
[1:12:29] for the message
[1:12:33] with the mess that you can never go
[1:12:35] wrong
[1:12:37] because the message is the word of God
[1:12:40] and it corrects the
[1:12:43] errorism so we praise the name of the
[1:12:46] Lord and so you know we have read the
[1:12:49] scripture in First Corinthians chapter 5
[1:12:51] and I'd like you to turn to that
[1:12:55] I wrote unto you verse 9 in an episode
[1:12:58] not to company with fornicators
[1:13:02] yet not all together with the
[1:13:05] fornicators of this world or with the
[1:13:08] Covetous or extrusionals or with
[1:13:11] idolaters for then machine needs to go
[1:13:14] out of the world but now I have written
[1:13:17] unto you not to keep Company If any man
[1:13:19] that is called a brother be a fornicator
[1:13:21] okovacious or an idolater or a real or
[1:13:24] drunk or an extortioner with search and
[1:13:26] want not to eat
[1:13:28] foreign
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:15:30] but now here we see
[1:15:33] the people who have maybe not yet heard
[1:15:36] the word
[1:15:38] the people who are doing all these works
[1:15:42] of the flesh Apostle Paul say do not run
[1:15:47] away from them
[1:15:49] but if somebody is called a brother
[1:15:54] if someone is a
[1:15:56] believers they have heard the word
[1:15:59] they have continued in the works of the
[1:16:02] flesh
[1:16:05] such as drunkenness foreign
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:17:32] by the word of
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:21] all of us here each of us are at a
[1:18:24] different level or stage of Grace
[1:18:29] we have received the same message
[1:18:33] foreign
[1:19:13] [Music]
[1:19:33] you know one thing that I know I believe
[1:19:36] I can never sin
[1:19:38] um
[1:19:41] the Bible says
[1:19:46] help me finish it cannot
[1:19:49] cannot so if you're born of God
[1:19:58] you can't be overtaken in a fall or
[1:20:01] someone
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:08] kick him out of the church is that right
[1:20:11] is that what the Bible says if a brother
[1:20:15] or a sister
[1:20:19] ye who are spiritual you that are still
[1:20:23] standing
[1:20:28] foreign
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:51] if you do that foreign
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:23:24] you are going to be their God
[1:23:44] take me
[1:23:48] what do you see there oh I don't see
[1:23:52] Moses I see Jesus
[1:23:55] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen when man
[1:23:59] had sinned so far away from God
[1:24:03] came down the form of a human body
[1:24:08] Jesus yes he thrown himself between man
[1:24:13] and God
[1:24:14] before you take them again
[1:24:19] because I love them
[1:24:22] they are my friends
[1:24:26] oh my praise the name of the Lord
[1:24:30] no matter what they had done since song
[1:24:33] I teach that is who I am sent to
[1:24:38] he sends a light
[1:24:40] a lot to shine where there is light
[1:24:44] where there is darkness
[1:24:46] that is where the light belongs
[1:24:50] Hallelujah Amina foreign
[1:25:37] original
[1:25:43] in their room
[1:25:45] you have got to stand with the people
[1:25:49] God did not come for Rocks
[1:25:52] come for uh for great and mountains
[1:25:57] this gospel came for people too
[1:26:03] I don't care how people are
