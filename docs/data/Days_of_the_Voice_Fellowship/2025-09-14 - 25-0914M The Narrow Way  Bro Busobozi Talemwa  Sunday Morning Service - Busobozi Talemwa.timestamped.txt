[57:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Billy Paul introduced me to this
[57:53] friend of his
[57:57] for a while. We've been texting back and
[57:58] forth and he has a lot of questions,
[58:02] but he I'm told he desires to be
[58:04] baptized
[58:07] in the name of our Lord Jesus.
[58:10] Father Billip has done a good job.
[58:14] That's the best you can do for your
[58:15] friend.
[58:18] Introduce the truth to them.
[58:21] Amen. How many enjoyed the meetings?
[58:26] Amen. Hallelujah. I I know it has been a
[58:28] very wonderful weekend
[58:32] uh with with a lot with the conventions
[58:36] and um I want to believe that we are all
[58:38] charged up.
[58:41] Amen. I will know. I will know it as I'm
[58:43] preaching this morning.
[58:46] If you're charged up or not.
[58:51] Amen. Uh this morning, I just want you
[58:53] to receive greetings from brother
[58:56] Polyup.
[58:59] We have internet uh we have internet
[59:01] issues because of power this morning.
[59:06] He told me he would be streaming but I
[59:07] know the stream is not very very good
[59:10] this morning
[59:15] for a while he's been trying to process
[59:17] u you know he came to me one time and he
[59:19] told me you see pastor we there's this
[59:21] opportunity that has come up for me to
[59:22] go and study abroad
[59:24] [Music]
[59:28] I don't know what you think about
[59:31] I just told him if it is study I I think
[59:33] about I I think it is good to to take
[59:36] seize the opportunity
[59:39] and so um you know the the country where
[59:43] he has gone to they are very good with
[59:44] technology
[59:48] I think brother Isaac was telling me
[59:50] that China Pakistan and some other
[59:52] countries the the number one
[59:58] he's going to he's going to study a
[1:00:01] course in in AI and robotics
[1:00:07] robotics in Pakistan.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; I have already connected him with the uh
[1:00:12] believers there
[1:00:15] for a few years. I've been corresponding
[1:00:17] with some brothers in Pakistan
[1:00:22] and so even yesterday we had a video
[1:00:24] conference with the brother
[1:00:27] and he was even more than willing to go
[1:00:29] and pick him up at the airport.
[1:00:34] The school already had other
[1:00:35] arrangements.
[1:00:38] I said first thing he arrives the next
[1:00:39] day I'll go and meet the brother.
[1:00:43] I understood there are some brothers
[1:00:44] from America going down there to have
[1:00:46] meetings
[1:00:48] around this this month.
[1:00:52] So he's going to arrive in meetings
[1:00:56] and I think I told him it would be a
[1:00:58] good opportunity.
[1:01:01] is you know to get to meet new people
[1:01:03] and
[1:01:07] it's not a a small course I mean it's a
[1:01:09] four year course
[1:01:12] so we are going to miss him uh really so
[1:01:14] much
[1:01:16] and I believe that God has sent him
[1:01:18] there for a purpose
[1:01:21] amen
[1:01:23] do you have did you receive the the
[1:01:25] document
[1:01:27] I know I did not communicate with you
[1:01:29] but if you could kindly check up on the
[1:01:32] media. There's a a document I've sent.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you can get it on the Is
[1:01:40] the projector working
[1:01:42] because of the power? Okay, let's try to
[1:01:44] do this after the service.

[1:01:48] and a few
[1:01:54] it doesn't work then we'll do it on
[1:01:55] Wednesday.
[1:01:58] Let us stand on our feet and go to the
[1:01:59] word.
[1:02:03] I'm still a bit tired in the body.
[1:02:06] Uh 10 days of uh serious work
[1:02:11] traveling across the country
[1:02:15] and the Lord has done a lot.
[1:02:17] A lot has been accomplished in the realm
[1:02:19] of the spirit
[1:02:22] and thank you for your prayers.
[1:02:25] We are going to the book of Matthew
[1:02:26] chapter 7.
[1:02:30] vers 13.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; We're reading in the name of the Lord.
[1:02:57] Enter ye in at at the straight gate, for
[1:03:00] wide is the gate, and broad is the way
[1:03:02] that leadth to destruction, and many
[1:03:04] there be which go in there. Because
[1:03:06] straight is the gate, and narrow is the
[1:03:08] way, which leadth unto life, and few
[1:03:10] there be that find it.
[1:03:35] Amen. Amen. Let us pray again. Father
[1:03:38] Lord, we just want to commit the people
[1:03:40] now into your hands.
[1:03:44] Lord, as we are going to share a little
[1:03:45] bit of your word,
[1:03:48] may it be a source of encouragement,
[1:03:51] may may we, Lord, be brought into your
[1:03:54] mind
[1:03:56] because we know that you give us your
[1:03:58] word
[1:04:00] to for us to uh walk away from our mind
[1:04:04] that we might receive the mind of
[1:04:05] Christ.
[1:04:09] For your word tells us that we should
[1:04:12] not be conformed to the world,
[1:04:16] but we should be transformed
[1:04:20] by the renewing of our mind.
[1:04:23] We know it's only your word which can do
[1:04:25] that.
[1:04:27] Lord, we submit oursel to the same this
[1:04:30] morning.
[1:04:32] Help me this morning to speak to get out
[1:04:34] of the way
[1:04:36] that Lord I will speak according to your
[1:04:37] will this morning
[1:04:40] and anybody and whoever will hear and
[1:04:42] listen to what we are saying this
[1:04:43] morning
[1:04:45] may they be encouraged
[1:04:48] in the name of our Lord Jesus.
[1:04:51] Amen. Amen. You may be seated please.
[1:04:58] This morning I'm speaking to you on a a
[1:05:00] little subject and I wanted to title it
[1:05:02] the narrow way.
[1:05:09] But maybe before I get into the word I
[1:05:10] just remembered there's a brother the
[1:05:12] first place we went to in Ethiopia
[1:05:18] um is an older brother.
[1:05:21] Uh you've heard of his testimony before.
[1:05:23] I've told it here.
[1:05:26] This is someone that um you know God
[1:05:29] really supernaturally provided a a lake
[1:05:32] for him to be baptized.
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:38] How many remember that testimony?
[1:05:41] Oh, if you remember
[1:05:44] that is in in in in
[1:05:46] Ethiopia, northern Ethiopia
[1:05:50] just about 100 km from the Red Sea.
[1:05:54] So and uh this brother you know
[1:05:57] sometimes they stream our services
[1:06:00] and of course he got to learn that we
[1:06:02] are having a project land fund project
[1:06:08] for the church and he contributed uh a
[1:06:12] sum of in his money 10,000 beer
[1:06:17] [Music]
[1:06:18] and so I refused it. I told him I did
[1:06:22] not come here to collect money.
[1:06:26] He said, "No, there's no way you can
[1:06:28] refuse.
[1:06:30] This one, it's not for you. It's for the
[1:06:32] work of God."
[1:06:35] I said, "All right, I will take it." And
[1:06:38] so I already handed it over to the
[1:06:40] treasurers
[1:06:42] and 250,000 shillings in our money.
[1:06:48] And so that that that goes to our land
[1:06:51] fund.
[1:06:54] And u maybe to add on the words that
[1:06:55] brother Daniel spoke already
[1:06:59] uh you know we are not going to be
[1:07:02] shocked
[1:07:04] if uh one of you gives a million or 2
[1:07:07] million
[1:07:09] or 500,000
[1:07:11] 300,000 whatever it is within a week
[1:07:17] because you see you are not you are
[1:07:19] contributing towards paying your um
[1:07:22] pledge
[1:07:26] and I want whatever you pledged target
[1:07:29] to finish it within six months
[1:07:32] target to do that. So if you pledged and
[1:07:35] you are giving nothing
[1:07:38] which we were reviewing it with the
[1:07:39] treasurers yesterday we there's quite a
[1:07:42] long list of brethren
[1:07:46] who are giving nothing towards their
[1:07:48] place.
[1:07:52] Remember the inspiration is
[1:07:55] you you you pledged and that is you
[1:07:57] brought an empty vessel
[1:08:01] and so now begin to pour in oil
[1:08:04] and that's going to be little by little
[1:08:07] you see but it will fill up. So don't
[1:08:09] say don't wait for the big
[1:08:12] uh breakthrough that you'll get.
[1:08:15] Actually the big breakthrough will not
[1:08:16] come
[1:08:19] if you do not give the little by faith.
[1:08:22] So give little by little by faith.
[1:08:26] If 5,000 is all you have
[1:08:28] or even 2,000,
[1:08:31] I'm talking now to those of you who are
[1:08:32] giving nothing or towards your plan.
[1:08:36] Give 1,000. Give 2,000 because whatever
[1:08:40] you give it will reduce from your place
[1:08:44] and also it will show that you have
[1:08:46] faith
[1:08:48] because faith without works is
[1:08:54] Are you alive? Faith without works is
[1:08:59] dead. So let us be alive.
[1:09:02] Give something if you have faith. And
[1:09:05] you're not giving because you have.
[1:09:08] You are giving because you want to have.
[1:09:12] Amen. And I believe that the Lord will
[1:09:15] honor that.
[1:09:17] Anybody who truly does that by faith
[1:09:22] Do not stress the team leaders.
[1:09:26] Some of them you know told me that they
[1:09:28] were stressed
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:32] because you know they will contact the
[1:09:34] members of their group
[1:09:37] who are actually members of the church
[1:09:40] and the ones who are not members of the
[1:09:41] church will be quicker to respond.
[1:09:45] It's a shame. Okay. If you know you have
[1:09:48] nothing
[1:09:51] on that group at least you encourage
[1:09:54] your team leader
[1:09:57] that is giving something.
[1:10:00] You know when we come here we give
[1:10:01] offering
[1:10:03] but some people have nothing to give
[1:10:06] by coming here by singing by clapping
[1:10:09] your hand you are giving to the Lord
[1:10:13] is that amen you are giving what you
[1:10:15] have
[1:10:16] it's not only money so please encourage
[1:10:19] your team leaders
[1:10:22] encourage them and then they will be
[1:10:24] able to also do better
[1:10:27] appreciate God for the brothers that
[1:10:28] ministered in my absence
[1:10:32] And also I would like to bring my
[1:10:33] condolences to sister Rose,
[1:10:36] some family members
[1:10:41] for those who stood with her and those
[1:10:42] who went to uh you know
[1:10:45] comfort her. God bless you.
[1:10:48] Amen. I know this is the last uh Sunday
[1:10:50] for our students. They're going back to
[1:10:51] school.
[1:10:54] So I hope I'll remember that we pray for
[1:10:56] them.
[1:10:58] the narrow way. Tell your neighbor the
[1:11:00] narrow way.
[1:11:02] That's what I'm speaking about this
[1:11:04] morning.
[1:11:05] Enter ye in at the straight gate.
[1:11:09] For wide is the gate and broad is the
[1:11:12] way that leadth to destruction,
[1:11:15] and many there be which go in their
[1:11:18] heart.
[1:11:19] Because straight is the gate, and narrow
[1:11:23] is the way.
[1:11:26] Can you repeat that? Straight is the
[1:11:28] gate,
[1:11:30] and narrow is the way,
[1:11:33] which leadth unto life, and few there be
[1:11:36] that find it.
[1:11:38] Straight is the gate, and narrow is the
[1:11:41] way. Straight is the gate, and narrow is
[1:11:45] the way. Narrow is the way. When you
[1:11:49] have the truth, you would think that
[1:11:51] everybody will will believe it.
[1:11:54] There are many places I've preached at
[1:11:57] And people came up and told me, "Oh, we
[1:12:00] wish this was preached in a stadium."
[1:12:04] And what they were meaning is that
[1:12:06] everybody needs to hear this.
[1:12:09] You know the message we are preaching,
[1:12:10] friend
[1:12:12] is not um for everybody.
[1:12:16] It is for the elect.
[1:12:19] At one point in time in the past,
[1:12:22] I used to believe that my preaching
[1:12:27] or I should say the preaching of the
[1:12:28] word.
[1:12:30] I used to believe that it will change
[1:12:32] everybody.
[1:12:36] That is true but not entirely true.
[1:12:40] It is true because when you hear the
[1:12:42] preaching of the word,
[1:12:45] you will not remain the same
[1:12:48] whether you have believed it or you have
[1:12:49] refused to believe it.
[1:12:54] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:12:56] You know, you remember the rich young
[1:12:58] ruler who came to Jesus.
[1:13:00] He never believed the word. Did he
[1:13:03] remain the same?
[1:13:06] What happened? The Bible says he went
[1:13:08] away
[1:13:10] sad in his heart
[1:13:13] because he had so many riches. So I
[1:13:15] believe the word will not will make you
[1:13:17] not remain the same.
[1:13:20] When you hear the word you cannot remain
[1:13:23] the same.
[1:13:25] Even you has come here today. You cannot
[1:13:28] go away the way you came.
[1:13:31] It is impossible.
[1:13:33] Amen. When you come in and and you sit
[1:13:37] under the the preaching of the word,
[1:13:39] something will happen. You cannot remain
[1:13:42] the same.
[1:13:44] Okay. But this word cannot make
[1:13:48] everybody believe
[1:13:51] because that is how it was in the
[1:13:52] beginning.
[1:13:54] God himself preached the word.
[1:13:57] Cain never believed.
[1:13:59] So if God can preach and someone cannot
[1:14:01] believe,
[1:14:04] it means there will be people who will
[1:14:06] never believe.
[1:14:09] The problem is not that the word has
[1:14:11] less power.
[1:14:14] But the problem is in the seed.
[1:14:18] It's just like the rain
[1:14:21] when it rains and you you have weed and
[1:14:24] you have wheat.
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:28] Oh, let me say you have maze
[1:14:31] and then you have uh cocoas.
[1:14:36] You understand?
[1:14:38] Those of you who have ever had gardens,
[1:14:41] this is an interesting revelation.
[1:14:44] You will have your maze or your beans or
[1:14:48] wheat and then cocoa bars and other
[1:14:50] weeds.
[1:14:53] You never planted those
[1:14:56] but they grow when you are sleeping.
[1:14:59] So when you go out into your garden,
[1:15:02] you find the cocoa, you find all the
[1:15:04] other types of weeds.
[1:15:06] So you have to weed them
[1:15:10] so that your seed that you planted can
[1:15:12] grow well.
[1:15:15] But for God, he never allowed for the
[1:15:18] weeds to be pruned or removed or weeded
[1:15:21] out.
[1:15:24] He said, "Let them grow together.
[1:15:29] So you see they are all going to enjoy
[1:15:31] the same rain
[1:15:34] and you know the Bible speaks about the
[1:15:35] latter rain and the former rain
[1:15:39] and and you know that means the teaching
[1:15:42] rain
[1:15:44] which is the former rain the teaching
[1:15:46] reign of the word
[1:15:48] the word rain and the latter rain which
[1:15:52] is the rain meaning the spirit.
[1:15:56] So which means that you know rain will
[1:15:58] come down
[1:16:00] upon or upon the garden. Follow me
[1:16:03] closely.
[1:16:05] The word will come down. The spirit will
[1:16:08] come down. But what determines what
[1:16:12] happens to what is in the garden.
[1:16:17] What will be harvested
[1:16:20] is not within the rain's capacity.
[1:16:28] But it is within what is in the garden.
[1:16:33] So you see you know that what you
[1:16:35] planted will have will you know come to
[1:16:37] maturity
[1:16:40] as long as it receives the rain.
[1:16:43] But you see at the end of it all you
[1:16:45] will harvest it and you'll be so happy
[1:16:47] and you'll take it.
[1:16:49] But then there will also be the wheats.
[1:16:52] These ones you never planted them.
[1:16:56] These ones came on their own.
[1:16:59] But you know how did they grow?
[1:17:02] They grew by the same rain.
[1:17:06] The same rain which matures the seed
[1:17:10] will mature the tears.
[1:17:13] So when the word is
[1:17:16] the tears are growing
[1:17:18] but the seed is also growing. The tears
[1:17:21] are growing and the seed is growing. The
[1:17:24] tears are manifesting
[1:17:27] and and and and you know the the the
[1:17:30] good seed is manifesting.
[1:17:32] And let me tell you, we are at
[1:17:34] manifestation time.
[1:17:39] This is a time of manifestation.
[1:17:41] We must manifest what is in us.
[1:17:46] Whatever is in you must come out.
[1:17:49] Amen. If it is seed, it will be seed. If
[1:17:54] it is,
[1:17:56] you cannot pretend
[1:17:59] is in there. When you hear the word, it
[1:18:03] must come out and we have arrived at
[1:18:06] that time
[1:18:08] when people have begun manifesting what
[1:18:11] is in them.
[1:18:15] Jesus was with the disciples.
[1:18:18] for three years and
[1:18:21] Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; He preached to them. He taught them.
[1:18:25] They matured. They matured. And one of
[1:18:28] them at the time of maturity
[1:18:32] manifested who which color he was
[1:18:37] and that was Judas. And Jesus said, "The
[1:18:41] entire call you 12
[1:18:44] and one of you a devil.
[1:18:48] You would wonder, I thought those he
[1:18:51] called
[1:18:52] are all part of the bride.
[1:18:55] Not all he called a part of the bride.
[1:18:59] Some that he called are not part of the
[1:19:02] evil.
[1:19:04] Not all that are called are chosen. Many
[1:19:08] are called, but few are chosen. Not
[1:19:11] everybody that calls himself a
[1:19:12] Christian.
[1:19:16] And there's only a few that are chosen.
[1:19:20] And those are the are the ones that will
[1:19:22] always find a narrow way.
[1:19:25] The narrow way is not an easy path.
[1:19:29] The narrow way is the word way.
[1:19:32] The narrow way is the spirit way.
[1:19:35] The narrow way is the Bible way. But not
[1:19:38] all will find that way.
[1:19:41] Blessed are you. If your eyes see, if
[1:19:45] your ears hear what the word of God say,
[1:19:48] that's what it says in the book of
[1:19:49] Revelation.
[1:19:51] Blessed is he.
[1:19:54] Amen. And I want to say I am blessed
[1:19:58] because I am one of the few.
[1:20:01] I am walking in a narrow way.
[1:20:04] But you see today I want to approach
[1:20:07] this
[1:20:09] uh in a way that I want to think that
[1:20:11] everybody will understand.
[1:20:15] And we are going to use a scripture in
[1:20:17] the book of Jude.
[1:20:20] And if you have your Bible, you can open
[1:20:22] to the book of Jude.
[1:20:29] Chapter Jude has only one chapter.
[1:20:33] Jude is just the book before revelation
[1:20:37] and I hope that today you can get some
[1:20:38] food.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; You know uh we have we are way past the
[1:20:44] time of just making you feel good.
[1:20:50] We want when you a person comes to
[1:20:51] church
[1:20:53] you have labor to come you will come and
[1:20:56] get food
[1:20:58] spiritual food.
[1:21:01] Are you ready to eat?
[1:21:03] Amen. So you must have appetite.
[1:21:06] Without appetite, you will not enjoy
[1:21:09] food. But if you have appetite, you're
[1:21:12] going to enjoy this this morning.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Jude 8.
[1:21:19] I want us to look at um we are going to
[1:21:21] read okay the whole chapter is good but
[1:21:24] the whole book is good but we will just
[1:21:25] read um from 8 to 13 and then we talk
[1:21:28] about it in phases.
[1:21:33] Likewise also these filthy dreamers
[1:21:35] defile the flesh, despise dominion, and
[1:21:37] speak evil of dignities. Yet Michael the
[1:21:40] archangel, when contending with the
[1:21:42] devil, he disputed about the body of
[1:21:44] Moses, dust not bring against him a
[1:21:47] railing accusation, but just said, "The
[1:21:50] Lord rebuke thee."
[1:21:52] But these speak evil of those things
[1:21:55] which they know not, but what they know
[1:21:58] naturally as brutal beasts, in those
[1:22:00] things they corrupt themselves. Woe unto
[1:22:03] them, for they have gone in the way of
[1:22:05] Cain, and reign and and reign greedily
[1:22:08] after the era of Balam for reward, and
[1:22:11] perished in the gain sayings of Kora. Uh
[1:22:13] these are spots in your fists of charity
[1:22:17] when they feast with you, feeding
[1:22:19] themselves with without fear. Clouds
[1:22:22] they are without water carried about of
[1:22:25] winds and trees whose fruit wither and
[1:22:29] without fruit and twice dead plucked up
[1:22:31] by the roots and raging waves of the sea
[1:22:34] forming out of their own shame.
[1:22:36] Wandering stars to whom is reserved the
[1:22:38] blackness of darkness forever. Hm.
[1:22:42] Brother, read it in English. Let the
[1:22:44] people get those words better.
[1:22:56] Foreign
[1:23:06] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[1:23:16] Fore!
[1:23:39] Fore!chch!
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:42] Foreign
[1:23:52] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:20] Now
[1:24:22] those words are powerful
[1:24:24] but those words are referring to the
[1:24:26] people who walk in the uh in the wide
[1:24:29] gate.
[1:24:34] You know the ones that walk in the in
[1:24:36] the broad way,
[1:24:39] the way that leads to destruction,
[1:24:41] these are false teachers.
[1:24:44] Now, the whole book of Jude
[1:24:46] warns us about false teachers.
[1:24:50] If you want to know anything that the
[1:24:51] Bible speaks about false false teachers,
[1:24:53] go and read the book of Jude.
[1:24:58] You know, he talks, he warns us about
[1:25:00] ungodly men.
[1:25:03] But you see this man creeped into the
[1:25:05] church
[1:25:08] and they turned the grace of God into
[1:25:10] sin
[1:25:14] denying the Lord.
[1:25:17] Of course, the Lord we know is the word.
[1:25:20] Amen. and and vers 11 which we have read
[1:25:24] here
[1:25:25] uh we will find that it compares them
[1:25:28] these men.
[1:25:30] Please follow me closely.
[1:25:32] Just just stay you know focused and
[1:25:36] listen very well cuz I want your soul to
[1:25:39] be fed.
[1:25:43] You see these men in verses 11, he
[1:25:47] compares them to three Old Testament
[1:25:50] examples.
[1:25:55] Uh-huh.
[1:25:56] Read verses 11 again and see it.
[1:26:00] Why unto them? For they have gone in the
[1:26:02] way of Cain,
[1:26:06] and reign greedly after the error of
[1:26:09] Balam for reward.
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:14] and perished in the gain sayings of
[1:26:16] Kora.
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:21] So now here he's talking about three
[1:26:23] examples in the Old Testament.
[1:26:26] You know, scripture was given for our
[1:26:28] example.
[1:26:33] And here he gives us three examples.
[1:26:36] And you know, by the way, this is
[1:26:38] amazing. Jude
[1:26:40] was a brother to Jesus.
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; You know she was given birth to by Mary.
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:51] The same one who gave birth to James.
[1:26:54] Are you following me? And you know Jude
[1:26:57] and and some of his brothers never
[1:26:59] believed in Jesus
[1:27:02] until he rose again from the dead.
[1:27:06] And that's why even as he's beginning to
[1:27:08] write,
[1:27:10] he is not saying Jud the brother of
[1:27:12] Jesus,
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:15] he had understood.
[1:27:18] He is to be despised.
[1:27:20] He is to be despised because he has not
[1:27:23] got the revelation of who Jesus was.
[1:27:28] He only knew him after the flesh.
[1:27:32] But after he knew him as the spirit,
[1:27:35] then he said, "Jude, the servant of
[1:27:38] Jesus
[1:27:40] Christ and the brother of James."
[1:27:44] So he now knows his place.
[1:27:47] I'm not even worthy to be called his
[1:27:49] brother.
[1:27:51] I am just a servant. But then he begins
[1:27:54] to warn people
[1:27:57] about those teachers
[1:27:59] that teach against Christ.
[1:28:03] You know, sometimes when you see a
[1:28:05] person who has no revelation of the
[1:28:07] truth,
[1:28:10] don't hate them. Love them as much as
[1:28:13] you can and show them the truth because
[1:28:17] when they grab it,
[1:28:19] they will fight for it with their life.
[1:28:24] Amen. I was one of them.
[1:28:29] I was one of them that did not believe
[1:28:31] this message. I fought against the
[1:28:34] message. I spoke against the message.
[1:28:36] But one day when it was revealed to me,
[1:28:40] oh brother, sister, let me see somebody
[1:28:44] that is saying something against the
[1:28:45] message.
[1:28:47] I will show them
[1:28:49] what Judy was showing them.
[1:28:52] I will speak to them without fear and
[1:28:56] with authority. You know Jesus gave us
[1:28:59] power.
[1:29:01] This power is for what?
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Not to fight. This power is to speak the
[1:29:06] word
[1:29:08] with authority.
[1:29:10] Hallelujah. Without fear, without favor
[1:29:15] of any man. Oh my my. So when you see a
[1:29:19] person trying to go against the word,
[1:29:23] have patience with them. And who knows
[1:29:26] who they might be? The ones that have
[1:29:29] stood for this word
[1:29:31] in many generations before us.
[1:29:34] There were men who fought it. Look at
[1:29:37] look at Saul who later became Paul and
[1:29:41] he stood for the word. He preached the
[1:29:44] word and he said if any man preach
[1:29:47] different from what
[1:29:49] let him be cut. That was a man who knew
[1:29:52] what he was talking about.
[1:29:54] He said the words we speak to you are
[1:29:57] not from the man's wisdom which they
[1:29:59] teach
[1:30:01] but he said it's from the spirit and
[1:30:03] that's what we desire.
[1:30:06] Amen. You need a personal revelation
[1:30:12] of the word.
[1:30:14] Now Jude goes and then he goes on to the
[1:30:18] Old Testament
[1:30:20] and he pulls out three examples.
[1:30:24] Remember he's trying to warn us against
[1:30:27] false teachers.
[1:30:29] He's trying to warn us against those
[1:30:31] that teach heresies
[1:30:35] or those that do not accept to walk in
[1:30:38] the narrow path.
[1:30:41] And then he gives us examples
[1:30:44] of those who refuse to walk the narrow
[1:30:45] way.
[1:30:48] And can we go through them this morning?
[1:30:52] I'm asking you shall we go for the
[1:30:55] first one he gives us is Cain and you
[1:30:59] can look up in Genesis 4
[1:31:03] we will not go there though because of
[1:31:05] you see represents a false worship
[1:31:12] coming to God with his own idea
[1:31:17] instead of coming to God by re
[1:31:20] revelation of the sacrif
[1:31:25] You know, God wants you to come to him
[1:31:28] wi with go with his revealed sacrifice
[1:31:34] which is a blood.
[1:31:36] But Cain could not do that. And those
[1:31:40] today who go the way of Cain,
[1:31:44] they choose they choose religion
[1:31:48] instead of revelation.
[1:31:53] There are things in my heart I want to
[1:31:55] say to you,
[1:31:57] but you will help me to say them to you.
[1:32:01] Amen. If you don't, then I'll just quit.
[1:32:06] So, help me preach this morning.
[1:32:09] Amen. And so, Cain was a man that uh you
[1:32:14] know went by religion
[1:32:17] and not revelation.
[1:32:20] Do do you know the great the worst thing
[1:32:22] that has ever hit the world?
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:26] You know what it is? Religion.
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:31] Religion is the worst thing that has
[1:32:33] ever hit the world.
[1:32:37] Organized religion.
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:32:41] Denominationalism.
[1:32:43] Brother Bam said it's a par brotherhood.
[1:32:47] [Music]
[1:32:49] Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; But you know the bride
[1:32:53] has been liberated
[1:32:56] from dark religion and
[1:32:58] denominationalism.
[1:33:02] And the bride has been given revelation.
[1:33:07] Never replace revelation by religion.
[1:33:13] The purpose of the preacher
[1:33:16] that is inspired by the spirit is to
[1:33:19] preach you away from religion
[1:33:23] into Christ.
[1:33:25] Away from religion into Christ. Away
[1:33:29] from the church into Christ. We are not
[1:33:32] preaching our church to you.
[1:33:35] We are not preaching our religion.
[1:33:38] We are not preaching ourselves to you.
[1:33:41] We are nothing.
[1:33:43] We are preaching to you Christ,
[1:33:46] the word.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the church is built upon the
[1:33:50] revelation of who Christ is.
[1:33:57] And I want you to see here as the
[1:33:59] prophet now begins to speak in the
[1:34:01] message, the God of this evil age.
[1:34:07] And he preached this in 1965.
[1:34:12] And I'm going to quote it for you. Very
[1:34:15] powerful words and they align with what
[1:34:18] I'm saying. Just listen. He says,
[1:34:20] "Notice what he will do.
[1:34:23] His thoughts." He thought God dwelt in
[1:34:26] in worldly beauty.
[1:34:30] He did that in heaven.
[1:34:33] Sin never begin in the Garden of Eden.
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:38] It began in heaven.
[1:34:41] When Lucifer, the son of the morning,
[1:34:44] exalted himself in beauty
[1:34:49] and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than
[1:34:52] that of might.
[1:34:55] And he thought that God dwelt in beauty
[1:34:59] and not his Cain. He didn't want no
[1:35:02] blood sacrifice.
[1:35:04] He didn't want to make himself dirty
[1:35:07] with blood all over.
[1:35:10] You know, blood stinks. Blood, you know,
[1:35:13] you know, makes you dirty and all that.
[1:35:15] Cain did not want nothing to make him
[1:35:18] dirty. He was a very smart boy. He come
[1:35:22] down and offered the fruit
[1:35:25] of the fields
[1:35:27] beauty
[1:35:30] upon the altar.
[1:35:32] Very religious.
[1:35:34] He done everything that just exactly
[1:35:36] like Abel done.
[1:35:38] He offered a sacrifice. He fell down
[1:35:41] before God in worship,
[1:35:44] obedient in every way, but without a
[1:35:48] revelation of the word.
[1:35:51] Doesn't matter how much you do.
[1:35:54] It doesn't matter what you do for God.
[1:35:57] God is not looking for people who will
[1:35:59] do something.
[1:36:01] God is looking for people who would have
[1:36:03] a divine revelation of the word.
[1:36:08] But whatever you do, you do by
[1:36:10] revelation.
[1:36:12] You don't do by the crowd.
[1:36:15] You don't do to be seen. You don't do to
[1:36:17] be hard.
[1:36:19] You don't do to be good. But you do what
[1:36:22] you do
[1:36:24] because you have a revelation
[1:36:26] in your heart. And you know you're doing
[1:36:29] it for the kingdom of God.
[1:36:33] You see, you know, Cain did everything
[1:36:35] that Abel did,
[1:36:37] but at the end of the sacrifice,
[1:36:40] God told him, I am not happy with your
[1:36:41] sight
[1:36:44] because there was no revelation.
[1:36:48] And the word was from the beginning,
[1:36:50] God's plan.
[1:36:54] It was God's plan.
[1:36:58] But God revealed by revelation
[1:37:04] the very thing that he vindicated and
[1:37:06] punctuated that was right.
[1:37:13] He revealed it by what? By revelation,
[1:37:17] not religion.
[1:37:22] Come on now. Not religion.
[1:37:25] not an altar,
[1:37:28] not belonging to church,
[1:37:31] not making a sacrifice,
[1:37:33] not being sincere,
[1:37:35] but by revelation of the word of God.
[1:37:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Someone can
[1:37:41] belong to a church. Someone can make a
[1:37:44] sacrifice. Someone can be sincere.
[1:37:48] Someone can have a religion. Someone can
[1:37:50] sacrifice on the outside. Pray every
[1:37:53] day. and still go to hell
[1:37:57] because they are not doing it by
[1:37:59] revelation.
[1:38:02] God does not require an altar.
[1:38:06] Doesn't require a church. It doesn't
[1:38:09] require sacrifice or charity,
[1:38:12] but it requires revelation.
[1:38:16] God revealing to him what it was. His
[1:38:18] mother God revealed to Abel.
[1:38:22] His mother did not take an apple
[1:38:26] that a snake give her.
[1:38:29] That's what religion will teach you. And
[1:38:32] you know, you remember those books which
[1:38:33] we used to see when we were young.
[1:38:36] I'm so happy my children will not read
[1:38:38] them.
[1:38:40] Putting wrong seed in their mind
[1:38:44] that a snake
[1:38:47] came and told talk to Eve.
[1:38:50] It was in a tree. Have you seen those
[1:38:52] books before?
[1:38:56] And it spoke to Eve. Did God say? Have
[1:39:00] you ever seen a speaking snake?
[1:39:03] It is not existent.
[1:39:06] There's no speaking snake. That's lies
[1:39:09] of religion.
[1:39:11] Lies of religion.
[1:39:14] You see,
[1:39:15] but she had, we now know that she had a
[1:39:19] sexual affair with a person of Satan
[1:39:28] in the form of the beast,
[1:39:31] not a reptile seat,
[1:39:34] but the most smartest,
[1:39:37] the most sist.
[1:39:42] image of man.
[1:39:44] The only thing that that that the seed
[1:39:47] would mix.
[1:39:55] Now science is trying to find him.
[1:40:01] Science is trying to find that beast.
[1:40:05] There is a connection between man and
[1:40:07] animal.
[1:40:11] Where is that beast?
[1:40:13] What is the connection?
[1:40:15] What is the missing link? I can't find
[1:40:18] it. But you and I by spiritual
[1:40:21] revelation, God has sent us a prophet
[1:40:25] with a message. Amen. And he has
[1:40:27] revealed to us what happened in the
[1:40:30] beginning.
[1:40:32] Amen. Amen. Praise God. And they never
[1:40:35] will find him
[1:40:38] because every bone in his body
[1:40:42] changed.
[1:40:44] But the Bible declares it to be so.
[1:40:47] Now it is a crawling rectile.
[1:40:51] Every bone was changed. All the hipbones
[1:40:54] were changed. All the leg bones were
[1:40:57] changed. The head bones were changed.
[1:41:00] And now they can't find him.
[1:41:03] They can't find the missing link.
[1:41:07] But the bride knows.
[1:41:09] [Applause]
[1:41:11] Nobody can believe this.
[1:41:14] Only by revelation.
[1:41:17] If you don't believe it, say, "Well,
[1:41:19] brother, I don't believe it. It's all
[1:41:21] right. You have no revelation."
[1:41:25] When revelation strikes you once,
[1:41:27] you will jump up and you will say, "I
[1:41:30] say it now. I see it now. I see it now.
[1:41:35] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; And in a report which I'll share with
[1:41:38] you, there was a denominational minister
[1:41:41] that came in one of the meetings we had
[1:41:44] ina. And he couldn't see it. The second
[1:41:48] time he couldn't see it. But the last
[1:41:50] time we met, he said, "I see it now."
[1:41:53] And he said, "What hindereth me to be
[1:41:56] baptized?"
[1:41:58] And I told him, if you believe with all
[1:42:01] your heart, you may be baptized. And
[1:42:04] right away, we went to the water and
[1:42:07] baptized him in the name of the Lord
[1:42:09] Jesus. I said Jesus is the same
[1:42:11] yesterday.
[1:42:15] Hallelujah. Amen. Spiritual revelation
[1:42:19] of the word. They reject revelation
[1:42:22] and they take religion.
[1:42:25] So sad. And brother Bam says here in God
[1:42:29] rich in mercy
[1:42:31] they they have run in the way of Cain
[1:42:34] perishing against sayings of Kora.
[1:42:38] They are running the way of Kain
[1:42:41] building altars.
[1:42:44] These days we have so many altars.
[1:42:48] Yes. So many altars
[1:42:52] in many of homes and churches
[1:42:56] building churches.
[1:42:58] How many churches do we have today in
[1:42:59] the world?
[1:43:01] So many right denominations
[1:43:04] making it flowery big more members
[1:43:11] than the rest of them.
[1:43:13] breaking in things. Anything that comes
[1:43:16] along and that jumped up and down or
[1:43:18] shook hands or was baptized in a certain
[1:43:20] way or spoke in tongues or or run
[1:43:22] through the floor or they put their name
[1:43:24] on the book
[1:43:32] say your members are
[1:43:35] no special revelation
[1:43:38] and then turn on the real truth
[1:43:41] that be preached and they deny
[1:43:46] How can it be so? That is what a mess we
[1:43:49] are in now. You see friends, these men,
[1:43:53] the Bible says they crept in unawares
[1:43:57] and they would try to replace to replace
[1:43:59] revelation
[1:44:02] with religion
[1:44:04] without us with the church system.
[1:44:11] Some of these people are sincere.
[1:44:17] sincere
[1:44:22] committed brother says they're sincerely
[1:44:24] wrong.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You see they offer
[1:44:36] sacrifice.
[1:44:37] They can even give themselves to be
[1:44:39] burned.
[1:44:41] They are faithful to their church.
[1:44:46] to the altars
[1:44:48] to their religion.
[1:44:50] Me one time when a preacher was
[1:44:52] preaching to me,
[1:44:54] he was preaching to me water baptism in
[1:44:55] the name of our Jesus
[1:44:58] and his name is brother Paul and I told
[1:45:01] him brother Paul.
[1:45:03] Uh I the bishop said he can emerge
[1:45:08] and he asked me a question and this
[1:45:12] really really moved me.
[1:45:15] He said brother do you think your bishop
[1:45:20] with his gown
[1:45:22] he can go inside the water
[1:45:27] and immerse you?
[1:45:29] When he said that, I felt he ridiculed
[1:45:33] my religion.
[1:45:35] He ridiculed my church
[1:45:38] and I was so bitter with him. And that's
[1:45:41] how it is today. People are so glued to
[1:45:44] their church
[1:45:46] to to their religion to to to their
[1:45:49] church system, to their men of God
[1:45:54] rather than the work. and messaging
[1:45:56] believers, we should never get to that
[1:45:59] level.
[1:46:03] We should never get there where people
[1:46:05] will fight on behalf of their pastor.
[1:46:09] Oh, because my pastor doesn't like you,
[1:46:11] I don't like you.
[1:46:14] I saw one time on television
[1:46:17] when one pastor dragged another to court
[1:46:20] and the people from that church came,
[1:46:23] you know, and they were going to court.
[1:46:26] I know you saw that and and these ones
[1:46:28] were almost undressing
[1:46:31] our pastors were even before you were
[1:46:34] these ones are saying they're Christians
[1:46:36] and the other saying they're Christians
[1:46:38] none of them is a Christian I say
[1:46:41] friends if you have the spirit of Christ
[1:46:43] in your heart
[1:46:45] you will know it's not your church it's
[1:46:48] not your religion it's not your
[1:46:50] sacrifice it's not your sincerity it is
[1:46:53] the revelation
[1:46:55] you have in your heart without Jesus
[1:46:58] Christ.
[1:47:01] Praise God.
[1:47:03] But God is only pleased
[1:47:07] by revelation,
[1:47:09] not how faithful you are to your church,
[1:47:12] not how faithful you are to your pastor,
[1:47:15] not how faithful you are to the religion
[1:47:18] or to your altar or how sincere you are.
[1:47:23] I can tell you I'm so sincere.
[1:47:26] It doesn't matter how sincere you are.
[1:47:30] You can be sincere and sincerely wrong.
[1:47:35] If your revelation
[1:47:39] does not match God's Bible,
[1:47:44] then your your your experience is wrong.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, God is pleased by
[1:47:54] revelation.
[1:47:57] And our faith is a revelation from God.
[1:48:01] Faith is a revelation.
[1:48:04] That is why I want to say just for a
[1:48:05] moment. It's a revelation.
[1:48:09] He has revealed it to you by his grace.
[1:48:17] It is nothing you did.
[1:48:19] You didn't work yourself into it.
[1:48:23] You you understand you you if you ever
[1:48:26] have faith
[1:48:28] it's given to you by the grace of God
[1:48:32] and God reveals it to you.
[1:48:35] Therefore faith
[1:48:37] is a revelation.
[1:48:40] Tell your neighbor faith is a revelation
[1:48:42] brother
[1:48:45] and the world church of God
[1:48:48] is built upon the revelation.
[1:48:53] Open your Bibles to the book of Hebrews
[1:48:54] chapter 6.
[1:48:58] 11 6.
[1:49:09] Praise God.
[1:49:12] I want you to look at that. It says,
[1:49:14] "But without faith,
[1:49:17] it is impossible to please him.
[1:49:21] Amen. Can we read it together?
[1:49:26] But without
[1:49:30] that's that's 1% of you.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; I want I'd like us to read it together.
[1:49:38] One, two, three, go. But without faith,
[1:49:42] it is impossible to please him.
[1:49:49] You want to please God,
[1:49:52] religion won't please you.
[1:49:55] God me I'm a method.
[1:49:57] I'm a Pentecost. I'm born again.
[1:50:01] I'm DVF member.
[1:50:04] I'm this one. God will say, "Nonsense.
[1:50:09] I'm not I'm not pleased."
[1:50:12] But say, "I have faith."
[1:50:15] He'll begin to smile. What did you say
[1:50:17] little bride? I have faith.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; You say yes. We are now beginning to
[1:50:23] talk because remember faith is not
[1:50:28] something you work yourself into.
[1:50:31] Faith is a revelation.
[1:50:35] Amen. Of who Jesus Christ is.
[1:50:39] For he that cometh to God
[1:50:42] must believe.
[1:50:46] that he is and is a reward of them that
[1:50:49] they seek.
[1:50:53] So Cain refused to have faith. Kane
[1:50:56] could not have faith because in his soul
[1:51:00] there was no seed jam of life.
[1:51:05] He couldn't believe what God was saying
[1:51:09] cuz God said if you if you do well will
[1:51:12] you not be accepted? Cain turned around
[1:51:15] and he went and killed his brother. Why?
[1:51:18] Because the Bible says his works were
[1:51:20] evil and his brother's righteous.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Brethren,
[1:51:28] the narrow way
[1:51:30] needs revelation.
[1:51:33] Revelation
[1:51:36] whereby you have a revelation
[1:51:39] that is all about you.
[1:51:42] It's all about
[1:51:44] Jesus,
[1:51:46] nothing about me, nothing about my
[1:51:49] accomplishment,
[1:51:52] nothing about Jesus.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; And in the message, we are not building
[1:51:58] a system
[1:52:01] of religion.
[1:52:03] Am I preaching to believers? We are not
[1:52:05] building system.
[1:52:08] We are building
[1:52:10] the body of Christ.
[1:52:13] by spiritual revelation.
[1:52:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; By spiritual revelation, not by church
[1:52:24] identity. See,
[1:52:26] but by spiritual revelation,
[1:52:29] not by religious identity,
[1:52:32] not by how sincere they are,
[1:52:35] but by revelation.
[1:52:39] And now Jude
[1:52:41] warners
[1:52:43] of the way of Cain.
[1:52:47] And I've just told you today
[1:52:50] the way of Kain. May we never go in the
[1:52:53] way of Kane.
[1:52:56] The way of Kane is a way of
[1:52:58] organization.
[1:52:59] He's a way of denomination. He's a way
[1:53:02] of religion. He's a way of of all those
[1:53:05] sacrifice and what have you.
[1:53:09] But no spiritual revelation of God.
[1:53:14] God is pleased by revelation.
[1:53:18] Have you seen that part? If you have
[1:53:19] seen it, say amen.
[1:53:23] Now let's talk about another way that he
[1:53:25] actually also warned us of
[1:53:29] the way of Balam.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; If you want to read it, you'll find it
[1:53:34] in Numbers 224.
[1:53:39] He represents greed.
[1:53:42] Actually today I cannot finish Balam.
[1:53:46] Even even Kane I just took a little
[1:53:48] piece.
[1:53:51] I can preach on the way of Kane as a
[1:53:52] series for several months
[1:53:57] because there are many scriptures many
[1:53:59] many
[1:54:01] even same thing but let's see what we
[1:54:03] shall cover today. So he represents
[1:54:06] greed and compromise.
[1:54:09] He's a prophet who loved the reward
[1:54:12] and tried to c Israel.
[1:54:15] Those who follow Balam are preachers who
[1:54:19] sell the word
[1:54:22] for money and popularity.
[1:54:30] Revelation 2:14. Let us read that.
[1:54:34] But I have a few things against thee
[1:54:37] because thou hast them there them that
[1:54:40] hold the doctrine of Balac.
[1:54:45] Who taught Balac to cast a stumbling
[1:54:47] block before the children of Israel
[1:54:50] to eat things sacrificed unto idols
[1:54:54] and to commit fornication.
[1:54:59] Praise God.
[1:55:01] There is if you have a church age book
[1:55:02] there is a whole lot of almost a chapter
[1:55:05] sub chapter that brother banam talks
[1:55:06] about balam
[1:55:12] and the pagan church age.
[1:55:15] So allow me to read for you a fraction
[1:55:16] out of it
[1:55:18] but as I read just say amen to the
[1:55:20] world. Now if we are going to understand
[1:55:23] what the doctrine of balum is in the New
[1:55:25] Testament,
[1:55:28] we had better get back and see what it
[1:55:30] is in the Old Testament
[1:55:34] and we apply to the third age and then
[1:55:36] bring it up to the present.
[1:55:41] So we are not going to do all that
[1:55:43] because of time but we just I'm going to
[1:55:45] give you a little summary
[1:55:48] so you can understand how the spirit of
[1:55:50] Balam operated.
[1:55:53] Now the story is found in numbers
[1:55:55] chapters 22-2.
[1:55:59] Now we know that Israel was the chosen
[1:56:01] people of God.
[1:56:04] They were the Pentecostals of their day.
[1:56:07] They had taken refuge under the blood.
[1:56:11] They had all been baptized in the Red
[1:56:13] Sea.
[1:56:14] And they came up out of the water
[1:56:16] singing in the spirit,
[1:56:18] dancing under the energy of the Holy
[1:56:20] Ghost.
[1:56:21] While Miriam
[1:56:23] the prophetess
[1:56:25] played her tambourine.
[1:56:27] Well, after a certain time of journey,
[1:56:30] these children of Israel came to Moab.
[1:56:34] Now you remember those of you who are
[1:56:35] good Bible readers
[1:56:37] that Moab
[1:56:39] was actually the son of Lot.
[1:56:44] You remember how Lot begat Mo?
[1:56:49] You remember when they were going out of
[1:56:50] uh of um you know Sodom
[1:56:54] and the fires were coming down
[1:56:57] and the speed the angels told them go
[1:56:59] run
[1:57:01] don't look back. You you remember that
[1:57:05] and then they started running out of the
[1:57:06] city of Sodom and then there were Lord
[1:57:10] his two daughters
[1:57:12] and the wife of Lord and as they were
[1:57:16] running Lord's wife looked back
[1:57:19] and you know they told them don't look
[1:57:21] back
[1:57:23] but they should look back because of the
[1:57:26] love
[1:57:27] of the things that were getting
[1:57:29] destroyed.
[1:57:31] Brother, if God calls you out of the
[1:57:33] world,
[1:57:35] run and don't look back.
[1:57:38] Some of you want to look back to the
[1:57:40] things you came out of.
[1:57:43] Look back.
[1:57:45] If you came out of something by the
[1:57:48] grace of God, I want to give you an
[1:57:50] instruction this morning.
[1:57:52] Do not look back.
[1:57:55] Tell your neighbor, don't look back,
[1:57:57] brother. Don't look back, sister.
[1:58:00] Come on now. Amen. But Lord looked back.
[1:58:05] Lot wife looked back. And when she did,
[1:58:08] the Bible says she became a pillar of
[1:58:10] salt.
[1:58:13] And right there, they began moving,
[1:58:18] Lord, and the two daughters.
[1:58:20] And the Bible says they gave him alcohol
[1:58:23] and he became drunk because they fell.
[1:58:27] They are going to be all by themselves.
[1:58:31] and they will die without children.
[1:58:34] There was nobody to marry them. Sister,
[1:58:37] never be desperate.
[1:58:42] If you daughter of Abraham,
[1:58:46] never behave like the daughter of Lot.
[1:58:50] Daughter of Abraham
[1:58:52] knows one thing that all that is mine
[1:58:55] shall come.
[1:58:58] It's only a matter of time.
[1:59:02] It's only a matter of time. Amen.
[1:59:05] Abraham's daughter. Allow me to preach
[1:59:07] to you this morning. And I want you to
[1:59:09] say, "Amen. Your husband is coming.
[1:59:13] [Music]
[1:59:16] God cannot allow me to say it if there
[1:59:18] was nobody who needed it.
[1:59:22] And God can't allow me to say it if it
[1:59:24] was not the right time for it."
[1:59:28] Say amen and believe it.
[1:59:32] Amen. But you see these ones were not
[1:59:35] patient enough
[1:59:37] and they gave their father alcohol
[1:59:40] and they used him to get children. And
[1:59:44] now Moab
[1:59:46] was one of those boys
[1:59:49] that was born out of that act.
[1:59:54] And now Israel lady baptized in the Holy
[1:59:57] Ghost.
[1:59:59] Bam says she was a type of the church
[2:00:02] because she was baptized through the Red
[2:00:03] Sea
[2:00:05] and you know they came out singing in
[2:00:07] the spirit dancing with the energy of
[2:00:10] the Holy Ghost and Miriam the prophet
[2:00:13] was playing a tambourine. They were so
[2:00:16] happy. They were shining.
[2:00:18] And then they reached the land of Mo,
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; the land of people that were born out of
[2:00:27] immorality.
[2:00:34] But remember, they had a natural
[2:00:36] connection with
[2:00:39] Abraham.
[2:00:43] because Lot was Abraham's cousin
[2:00:47] rather nephew.
[2:00:50] So, Israel were related with Moabit.
[2:00:53] I want you to see that. Amen. So, you
[2:00:57] know, your Moabites are not entirely
[2:00:59] people you don't know.
[2:01:04] Amen. Stay away from the Moabites.
[2:01:08] Whenever you get to them, ask them for
[2:01:11] one thing.
[2:01:13] Don't ask them to connive and correlate
[2:01:16] with you,
[2:01:18] but ask them for one thing. Give way.
[2:01:22] Let me pass through.
[2:01:25] Let me pass through
[2:01:27] my revival.
[2:01:28] And the Bible says we are here on earth
[2:01:32] as
[2:01:35] we are going somewhere.
[2:01:38] All the people around us. They are the
[2:01:40] moabites.
[2:01:42] We know them. We are born among them. We
[2:01:46] related to them. They don't belong with
[2:01:48] us.
[2:01:50] We have another covenant.
[2:01:53] We are the covenant people.
[2:01:56] We are going in the rapture.
[2:01:58] We are waiting for the body change.
[2:02:01] We cannot come here.
[2:02:04] Let us go through
[2:02:07] Some of you your moabitete is the body.
[2:02:12] Tell your flesh. Come on little more,
[2:02:16] let me through. Let me through. Let me
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; I don't belong here.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere to a land that is so
[2:02:26] beautiful that flow with milk and honey
[2:02:31] where my promise is.
[2:02:34] And I'm giving the honest
[2:02:36] of the spirit. That's why I'm dancing.
[2:02:39] That's why I'm shouting. Why? Because
[2:02:41] I'm Holy Ghost
[2:02:45] of God.
[2:02:48] Amen. And you know they were going
[2:02:50] through. And the Moabites knew the truth
[2:02:55] whether they lived up to it or not.
[2:02:59] When Israel came to the to the borders
[2:03:01] of Moab
[2:03:03] and they sent messengers to the king of
[2:03:05] Moab,
[2:03:08] they said to them like this,
[2:03:11] "We are brothers,
[2:03:13] let us pass through your land.
[2:03:17] If our people or our animals eat or
[2:03:19] drink anything
[2:03:23] while we are going through, we will
[2:03:25] gladly pay for it.
[2:03:28] But King Balac
[2:03:31] who was the king of the Moabites
[2:03:34] was got very excited.
[2:03:38] The head of that Nickelon bunch, that
[2:03:41] head rather, that head king, that head
[2:03:44] of that that Nickelon bunch
[2:03:49] was not about to let the church come
[2:03:52] through with its signs and wonders and
[2:03:54] diverse manifestations of the Holy
[2:03:56] Ghost,
[2:04:02] with their faces shining with the glory
[2:04:04] of God.
[2:04:08] That's why I believe,
[2:04:10] listen church, listen.
[2:04:12] I believe a true genuine believer of
[2:04:15] this message
[2:04:18] filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:04:20] can never be a Nicholant.
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:25] Never never agree with anybody who will
[2:04:27] call another brother a Nicholant.
[2:04:33] Nicholant are Moabites.
[2:04:38] because they don't have the word,
[2:04:41] they don't have the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:43] Therefore, they cannot control the
[2:04:45] people
[2:04:48] by the word and the Holy Ghost. So, the
[2:04:50] only thing they have is their own
[2:04:53] regulations and laws and church and
[2:04:55] systems
[2:04:58] and we are delivered from that.
[2:05:02] We are on the rapture expresses
[2:05:06] are shining with the glory.
[2:05:09] We have them wonders, signs and
[2:05:11] miracles.
[2:05:15] If the devil doubts that
[2:05:17] I am a wonder
[2:05:22] every day I leave is a miracle.
[2:05:27] Hallelujah. Because the devil thought I
[2:05:28] would have been dead.
[2:05:32] So brother Bam says that Nicolant head
[2:05:39] said no
[2:05:41] too spiritual I can't allow them to be
[2:05:43] near my people.
[2:05:46] It was too risky
[2:05:48] and he might lose some of his crowd.
[2:05:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Just like somebody who
[2:05:57] would tell you, "Oh, there's a
[2:05:59] convention here. Don't go there. Why?
[2:06:02] Why? Why? Why?"
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; He's fearing something.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; But you know what I believe? If what I
[2:06:10] have is what you have, if I make a
[2:06:14] convention, let your people come. If you
[2:06:16] make a convention, let my people come.
[2:06:19] If you have what they want, they'll join
[2:06:21] you. No problem. But if I have what I
[2:06:24] want, if I have what they have, they
[2:06:27] will come.
[2:06:29] You understand? Who's are they anyway?
[2:06:34] They are for the Lord.
[2:06:36] Amen. I want to show you how
[2:06:38] denominations work.
[2:06:41] The narrow way is against denomination.
[2:06:47] We are not afraid. You know the
[2:06:49] Pentecost will tell the people
[2:06:52] don't go to those people
[2:06:55] they have a demon in them.
[2:06:58] The demon is called and then they
[2:07:00] mention the name of a prophet
[2:07:04] and they say go among them
[2:07:07] that demon will catch you
[2:07:10] and you will stop believing the trinity
[2:07:13] and you will stop believing. You know in
[2:07:16] our denomination
[2:07:18] you stop believing in women
[2:07:21] you will stop you know putting on makeup
[2:07:25] and you know you will throw away your
[2:07:26] trouser
[2:07:28] if you have been looking as a beautiful
[2:07:29] girl
[2:07:31] so you demon will catch you
[2:07:34] don't go to those what are they afraid
[2:07:37] of
[2:07:38] if that is a demon I wanted to catch me
[2:07:44] I wanted to catch
[2:07:46] Because anything which will take me back
[2:07:48] to the Bible,
[2:07:51] I don't care what it is. God say the way
[2:07:55] that is called heresy
[2:07:58] worship by the God of my father.
[2:08:01] I wanted to catch me. What are they
[2:08:04] afraid of?
[2:08:08] Hallelujah.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; What are they afraid of?
[2:08:12] M
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; let me tell you friends I am I love this
[2:08:16] message so much because we have been
[2:08:18] liberated.
[2:08:20] We have been set free.
[2:08:23] Amen.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; We are moving by the power of the Holy
[2:08:26] Ghost.
[2:08:28] The power of the Holy Ghost is like a
[2:08:30] magnet.
[2:08:32] It will pull everybody. It will pull
[2:08:34] everybody that was predestinated
[2:08:38] to life.
[2:08:41] Where will they where will he pull them
[2:08:43] to?
[2:08:45] Not to join a system or church,
[2:08:49] but to join the Holy Ghost move.
[2:08:55] But you see this man Balac was afraid.
[2:09:01] He said, "Your people may this thing
[2:09:03] might attract me."
[2:09:07] In fact, so great was his fear of them
[2:09:12] that he went to an prophet called Bal
[2:09:20] and I asked
[2:09:24] and asked him to mediate between him and
[2:09:26] God
[2:09:30] and petition the Almighty to c Israel
[2:09:32] and render them important.
[2:09:42] Oh my,
[2:09:44] this one turns me on right now.
[2:09:47] Hallelujah.
[2:09:49] See, the devil wanted to render them
[2:09:51] impotent.
[2:09:54] If Israel was a spiritual church today,
[2:09:58] if it was a Pentecostal church today,
[2:10:02] then that's the same thing the devil
[2:10:03] wants from us to us.
[2:10:07] He wants to c us.
[2:10:10] He wants to render us impotent.
[2:10:14] Can you imagine? We defy the devil and
[2:10:17] all his armies.
[2:10:19] It cannot happen.
[2:10:21] The devil wants to render you impotent.
[2:10:24] He wants to to make you useless.
[2:10:28] You make business, it falls down.
[2:10:31] You get a job, it doesn't work out.
[2:10:34] And then you begin to feel maybe I'm
[2:10:36] cursed.
[2:10:38] Maybe if you are by the hearing of this
[2:10:41] word today, you are being loosed.
[2:10:46] None of you can be cast.
[2:10:49] None of you can be useless.
[2:10:53] Why? Because you are in the Holy Ghost
[2:10:55] camp.
[2:10:58] You are moving by the leadership of the
[2:11:00] spirit.
[2:11:02] You are led by a man of God.
[2:11:06] Who is it? The spirit of God today
[2:11:10] leading us to the promised land.
[2:11:16] and Balam being eager to take part in
[2:11:18] political affairs and become a great
[2:11:21] man.
[2:11:25] So he was only too glad to do so.
[2:11:30] Those kind of preachers
[2:11:32] who are very cheap,
[2:11:35] they will do anything for something.
[2:11:40] Listen, preacher man, if you've been
[2:11:43] called by God, always obey God.
[2:11:47] Now, let me tell you, and I preach to
[2:11:49] you as as as my local church.
[2:11:54] I will never go anywhere
[2:11:57] or do anything in the name of the Lord
[2:12:00] that God never sent me to do.
[2:12:02] The day I reach that point,
[2:12:05] I should quit preaching.
[2:12:08] I believe with all my heart that a God
[2:12:11] minister
[2:12:13] must never serve for money,
[2:12:16] never suffer for something is promised
[2:12:17] to you.
[2:12:20] But you must do what you're doing
[2:12:23] because you have a calling
[2:12:25] because you have an assignment.
[2:12:28] You are led by God.
[2:12:31] And let me tell you, the way of God is
[2:12:33] the narrow way.
[2:12:36] It is not pleasant.
[2:12:39] It will be you will be persecuted.
[2:12:42] Many things will happen to you. But you
[2:12:45] know what? It is a good way. It will be
[2:12:48] a successful way.
[2:12:51] The way of the word, brother,
[2:12:54] will never be defeated.
[2:12:56] The way of the word, sister, is a
[2:12:59] perfect way.
[2:13:02] It is not easy. It is painful.
[2:13:06] But everybody who got through that way,
[2:13:09] the Holy Ghost will be with them
[2:13:12] because he promised. He said, "I will be
[2:13:16] with you and I will be in you. I will
[2:13:20] lead you."
[2:13:22] That's what we believe
[2:13:24] because the narrow way is the right way.
[2:13:28] But Balam wanted power.
[2:13:31] He wanted to be political and great.
[2:13:36] and seeing that he had to approach to
[2:13:38] and receive an audience from God to get
[2:13:41] the people cars.
[2:13:46] So he wanted to go to God and see if he
[2:13:48] can get the permission to go.
[2:13:53] Now isn't just that like the Nikolans we
[2:13:55] have with us today
[2:14:00] everyone that go want to go their way.
[2:14:08] You are leaving this church.
[2:14:11] I c you.
[2:14:13] They may not even say it like that. But
[2:14:16] they may say the blessing of God is not
[2:14:19] with you. Your blessing has remained in
[2:14:22] this church because you have left.
[2:14:25] You know you
[2:14:29] nicolant spirit.
[2:14:33] Bam said they will cast everyone
[2:14:37] that won't go in their way.
[2:14:40] You see that's the spirit. You have to
[2:14:43] understand that when asked God for
[2:14:46] permission to go.
[2:14:48] God turned him down.
[2:14:52] Let me go and cast these people. God
[2:14:56] said no.
[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:00] The devil wanted to cast you
[2:15:03] but God said no.
[2:15:07] No man can cast you because you are
[2:15:09] anointed.
[2:15:11] Do something for me. Amen. Touch your
[2:15:14] head. You know faith without works is
[2:15:16] dead. Touch your head and say nothing
[2:15:20] can no one can cast me
[2:15:22] because I am blessed because I'm
[2:15:25] anointed.
[2:15:27] Hallelujah.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; No one can cast it because we are
[2:15:32] blessed. We are anointed. We are
[2:15:35] inspired by our God who is the original
[2:15:38] life.
[2:15:40] Hallelujah. Glory.
[2:15:43] Glory.
[2:15:46] My my God turned him down.
[2:15:49] But Balac insisted
[2:15:53] promising him even even greater rewards
[2:15:55] than
[2:15:58] join us and do for me this I will give
[2:16:00] you this.
[2:16:02] They say every man has a price.
[2:16:07] Someone will tell you
[2:16:09] I remember this brother here,
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; brother Brian.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Some man came to him that was a real
[2:16:16] true balac.
[2:16:19] He came told him the way I see you and
[2:16:22] the way you know how to speak the word.
[2:16:25] A great man of God.
[2:16:28] Come I will give you this. I'll give you
[2:16:29] this. I'll give you this.
[2:16:31] That was a Nigerian person said I'm
[2:16:33] going to give you this and I'm going to
[2:16:34] give you this. I'm going to give you and
[2:16:37] you will become big and great. Show him
[2:16:39] pictures. You see how big our name is?
[2:16:43] You are going to become big. Wherever
[2:16:45] you are, they don't know who you are.
[2:16:48] They put you.
[2:16:53] Thank God that our brother Brian skipped
[2:16:54] that.
[2:16:57] The devil wanted to make him prophet
[2:16:58] Balam.
[2:17:03] You know, every believer of this message
[2:17:04] knows a lot.
[2:17:07] That's the truth.
[2:17:13] Praise God. And so Balam was given a lot
[2:17:17] of things.
[2:17:19] And and then now one answer from God
[2:17:21] should have been enough.
[2:17:25] But Balam went back to ask God.
[2:17:29] God said no.
[2:17:31] But the way these things I
[2:17:37] if I can get 50 million
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; million.
[2:17:44] Okay. I know it is not right but
[2:17:46] let me ask God again.
[2:17:50] Maybe he will accept so I can be blessed
[2:17:53] also because he said we shall be heads
[2:17:55] and not heads.
[2:17:58] After all is also going to do the work
[2:18:00] of God.
[2:18:03] Even if I'm in the denomination
[2:18:06] and some musicians are in the bal
[2:18:08] anointing
[2:18:12] you find them going to the
[2:18:15] wrong altars
[2:18:19] altars.
[2:18:20] You know, when you play music,
[2:18:23] it's not about you playing for God.
[2:18:26] It's about which altar you're playing on
[2:18:31] and which vision you are pushing.
[2:18:36] You remember in the Bible there was a
[2:18:39] man, the king Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:18:42] you know, he had a wrong vision.
[2:18:45] It wasn't of God, but he had good
[2:18:48] musician.
[2:18:50] I don't know where he got them from.
[2:18:52] Perhaps some of them might have been
[2:18:53] Jews.
[2:18:55] They sold out.
[2:18:57] They and he told the people when you
[2:18:59] hear music,
[2:19:02] I don't know the symbols and the drums
[2:19:05] and the piano
[2:19:07] whatever the drums and everything
[2:19:10] then you bow.
[2:19:13] You know, God uses music
[2:19:16] and the devil copied that.
[2:19:19] You know music brings an atmosphere.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Music.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they started
[2:19:32] they all bow
[2:19:35] and some brothers we are standing they
[2:19:37] said this anointing is not ours.
[2:19:40] Okay we are warning you one more time.
[2:19:44] Okay,
[2:19:50] there's a way we don't play drums. By
[2:19:52] the way,
[2:19:56] there are things we don't play
[2:19:59] because we are inspired different.
[2:20:03] We don't play about entertainment.
[2:20:14] We don't play to entertain.
[2:20:17] Yes, we play to worship.
[2:20:21] But you say again, one more time.
[2:20:28] [Music]
[2:20:30] Everybody bow,
[2:20:32] you know. And then they refused to bow
[2:20:36] because they realized that anointing was
[2:20:37] not there.
[2:20:39] What am I talking about? Musicians play
[2:20:42] at an altar.
[2:20:45] They are worshiping the God of that
[2:20:46] altar.
[2:20:51] So friends, you know, don't go the way
[2:20:53] of Balam.
[2:20:55] Don't go the way of Balam. Someone said,
[2:20:57] "What about a preacher being invited to
[2:20:58] the Pentecost denomination?"
[2:21:04] That's different because Elijah went to
[2:21:06] the altar that was sacrificed to give to
[2:21:09] Bal.
[2:21:12] But he went to restore the altar.
[2:21:16] So the preacher goes with to restore
[2:21:18] those anchors.
[2:21:21] So when I'm invited to the Catholic
[2:21:23] church, I will go
[2:21:26] and I will go to preach the message of
[2:21:29] you get the point. So there's a
[2:21:30] difference. Praise God. Amen. And now
[2:21:34] I'm realizing my time is first spent.
[2:21:36] Let me just about 15 minutes and then I
[2:21:38] I'll I'll cut it and maybe continue.
[2:21:42] All right. But now, okay, are you still
[2:21:45] with me now? Now, one answer from God
[2:21:47] should have been enough.
[2:21:50] But not for selfwilled.
[2:21:55] When God saw his perversity,
[2:21:58] he told him to go to get up and go.
[2:22:03] You see these people who are saying me
[2:22:05] I'm a woman preacher I was going when
[2:22:07] God told me to go
[2:22:11] what do you expect? You went on the on
[2:22:13] the prayer mountain for 40 minutes
[2:22:16] and night
[2:22:17] and you prayed. God saw your perversity
[2:22:21] and said okay go. But that was
[2:22:24] permissive will
[2:22:28] perfect will always agree with the
[2:22:29] world.
[2:22:32] Quickly he saddled the donkey
[2:22:36] and away he went. He should have
[2:22:38] realized that this was simply God's
[2:22:39] permissive will
[2:22:43] and he wouldn't be able to cast them if
[2:22:44] he went 20 times and tried 20 times.
[2:22:51] Now like people today
[2:22:56] they believe in three gods.
[2:22:58] They get baptized in three titles
[2:23:00] instead of the name.
[2:23:03] And yet God will send a spirit upon them
[2:23:06] as he did unto Palum.
[2:23:11] And they will go on believing that they
[2:23:12] are exactly right.
[2:23:16] And here they are actually perfect
[2:23:18] balammites.
[2:23:23] See they don't know.
[2:23:26] Go ahead anyway.
[2:23:28] do it your way. Then you say, "Well, God
[2:23:30] has blessed us. It must be all right.
[2:23:36] I know he has blessed you. I don't deny
[2:23:39] that. But it's the same organizational
[2:23:41] route that Balam took.
[2:23:46] It's defiance to God's word.
[2:23:50] It's a false teaching."
[2:23:53] And friends, we have to be liberated.
[2:23:58] and be freed and never come in contact
[2:24:02] with this way of
[2:24:06] it is real.
[2:24:08] It's a way of denominationalism.
[2:24:12] It's a way of perversity.
[2:24:15] It's a way of the permissive will
[2:24:19] not
[2:24:21] is not the narrow way.
[2:24:23] But the narrow way is the way of the
[2:24:26] world.
[2:24:29] Look, I've not even taken half of what I
[2:24:31] wanted to say,
[2:24:34] but let us stand up on our feet.
[2:24:37] If you want more, you can just come on
[2:24:38] Wednesday.
[2:24:42] Praise God.
[2:24:44] Narrow way.
[2:24:47] May God help us to walk in a narrow.
[2:24:51] There's a song by inspiration I got some
[2:24:53] years ago.
[2:24:57] Brother Shem, I don't I think you know
[2:24:58] it. You've played it before.
[2:25:02] I'd like to sing that little chorus. I
[2:25:04] don't know if the brother you have the
[2:25:05] words. Uh we've sung it here before. I'm
[2:25:07] not sure.
[2:25:11] And I wrote it down. I was in Aasa at
[2:25:12] the time. I think about six years ago.
[2:25:17] Amen. Give me truth, mercy, and love.
[2:25:23] so that I may dwell in your praise.
[2:25:27] Give me truth, mercy, and love.
[2:25:30] I'll begin with the first time and I
[2:25:32] will sing it. Maybe you can listen first
[2:25:33] and then you can join in afterwards.
[2:25:37] Oh my life

[2:27:10] and love
[2:27:13] so that I
[2:27:16] so that I
[2:27:18] may dwell
[2:27:21] in your praisees
[2:27:27] be true.
[2:27:33] Let us try to sing one more time the
[2:27:35] chorus. Give me truth.
[2:27:38] Give me truth.
[2:27:42] I see.
[2:27:47] Give me truth.
[2:27:49] Give me
[2:27:53] mercy
[2:27:55] and love.
[2:27:58] So that I may
[2:28:06] in your praisees
[2:28:12] me.
[2:28:15] [Music]
[2:28:19] Now listen to this song.
[2:28:24] all my life
[2:28:26] with truth everywhere.
[2:28:33] I need a change, dear Lord, to walk in
[2:28:39] your way.
[2:28:45] Give me truth,
[2:28:49] mercy,
[2:28:51] and grace. Praise
[2:28:54] the Lord
[2:28:56] the narrow way
[2:28:59] to walk
[2:29:01] every day. Let's sing the chorus one
[2:29:04] more time. Give me, give me,
[2:29:10] oh mercy
[2:29:13] and love. Hallelujah. Tell him now as a
[2:29:17] prayer. Oh give me truth.
[2:29:21] Give me your mercy
[2:29:25] and
[2:29:27] so that I may
[2:29:32] I may
[2:29:42] be through
[2:29:46] mercy
[2:29:48] and love.
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:53] Everybody shalom can come and help. Let
[2:29:55] us sing. Lead me Lord and I'll follow.
[2:29:57] Lead me Lord and I'll call. You have
[2:29:59] called me and I will answer. Lead me
[2:30:02] Lord I will go. May may may God help us
[2:30:06] that we will follow his leadership into
[2:30:08] the narrow way.
[2:30:12] The narrow way, the wide way,
[2:30:16] that one will never fade you.
[2:30:30] [Music]

[2:30:34] [Music]

[2:31:14] leave me.
[2:31:18] I will die.
[2:31:26] Heat.
[2:31:30] Heat.
[2:31:40] Heat. Heat.
[2:31:46] [Music]
[2:31:53] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:31:54] [Music]
[2:32:03] Heat. Heat.
[2:32:23] I will go
[2:32:28] with every head bow, every eye closed.
[2:32:32] I want to invite those who are going to
[2:32:34] go back to school to come and stop every
[2:32:36] day.
[2:32:38] [Music]
[2:32:45] Everyone
[2:32:49] in reverence.
[2:32:53] [Music]
[2:32:58] Thank you, Lord. Thank you.
[2:33:02] Just stand right here.
[2:33:05] Let us pray.
[2:33:08] Everybody bow your head and pray for
[2:33:09] them.
[2:33:14] Our loving Jesus,
[2:33:17] even as we've been talking about
[2:33:18] leadership
[2:33:21] into your into your narrow way,
[2:33:24] for you said in your word,
[2:33:27] my way is not your way.
[2:33:29] My thoughts are not your
[2:33:33] way that is a perfect way. That is the
[2:33:36] narrow way.
[2:33:38] Lord, even as these uh children go back
[2:33:41] to school,
[2:33:43] I want to commit them into
[2:33:46] some way young and are going to be
[2:33:49] commuting from home.
[2:33:51] Others are young but are going to go to
[2:33:53] some hostages
[2:33:55] and others are older and I commit each
[2:33:58] of them into
[2:34:00] Lord. May you lead them.
[2:34:03] The Holy Spirit go with them.
[2:34:06] We know there are many uh there's
[2:34:07] another god, a god of this evil age
[2:34:10] that rules over this world. But may you
[2:34:13] preserve them. May you encumber around
[2:34:16] them with the Holy Ghost.
[2:34:18] May you keep them away from evil
[2:34:19] spirits.
[2:34:21] May they come back home when they were
[2:34:24] spiritually sound and your name shall be
[2:34:27] glorified. I also pray that you'll give
[2:34:30] them wisdom, Lord,
[2:34:32] knowledge, father, bind every force of
[2:34:34] evil,
[2:34:36] might come to attack them in any way
[2:34:38] that they may not excel in their school.
[2:34:42] That's the wrong spirit of nobody will
[2:34:45] come and try to make them useless
[2:34:49] in the name of Jesus
[2:34:53] that they will go and become useful. I
[2:34:56] will go in the name of the Lord
[2:34:59] Lord in the name of Jesus.
[2:35:02] Amen. And father we pray even for
[2:35:06] brother
[2:35:07] Father Lord who is at this present time
[2:35:09] in Qatar

[2:35:17] an extended period of time Lord it's a
[2:35:20] new place new
[2:35:25] but may you give him grace deserving
[2:35:27] father let your angel always be with him
[2:35:30] father
[2:35:32] and may you oh God turn him into a real
[2:35:35] man of God.
[2:35:37] Stand up to the challenges of your life
[2:35:40] as into the foreign land. We thank you
[2:35:43] father as we ask your blessing upon you
[2:35:46] in the name of Jesus.
[2:35:49] Amen. Amen.
[2:35:53] Amen. You may go back.

[2:35:59] ready? No. No. Okay. So, God bless your
[2:36:01] church.
[2:36:03] I'll invite the song leader.
[2:36:06] Uh I will share with you probably the
[2:36:09] Lord willing the report on Wednesday
[2:36:14] and so that you can be able to know what
[2:36:16] the Lord is doing
[2:36:18] and also I want you to remember the
[2:36:20] youth meetings in

[2:36:35] know a few may not be here for for the
[2:36:38] meeting but uh maybe next Saturday we

[2:36:42] for for those preparations.

[2:36:57] brother Isaac was where's where's
[2:36:59] brother Isaac?
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; Come and give us a report.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; But he spoke and um mentioned that the
[2:37:09] elders I will handle them but I'm
[2:37:11] requesting the elders also to give their
[2:37:13] pledges to him please
[2:37:19] so that we can consolidate everything.
[2:37:22] in one fundraising
[2:37:25] effort. So let him come and give us a
[2:37:28] report so far how far we are
[2:37:33] regarding the preparations and the
[2:37:34] fundraising for the year
[2:37:37] and then afterwards we shall have the
[2:37:39] song that dismiss us with a song.
[2:37:43] [Music]
[2:37:47] God bless you.
[2:37:56] God richly bless you.
[2:37:59] Um
[2:38:01] I'm just going to take uh just a few
[2:38:05] minutes uh not more than five. So uh I
[2:38:09] would love to thank you first uh for the
[2:38:12] contributions and those who pledged uh
[2:38:16] uh God richly uh bless you. So uh we are
[2:38:20] having um
[2:38:23] first of all uh if anyone that pledged
[2:38:26] and has not yet joined the WhatsApp
[2:38:28] group uh kindly uh request brother Dixon
[2:38:33] to add you uh in one way or the other.
[2:38:37] he can send you the link or you give him
[2:38:39] your number or if you want to join uh
[2:38:42] the group that we created that group is
[2:38:44] uh voluntary not that everyone should
[2:38:47] join so if you are not willing to
[2:38:48] contribute um kindly
[2:38:52] don't be there it's only for people who
[2:38:55] prayed for this cause
[2:38:58] so um
[2:39:01] another reminder is we had another list
[2:39:04] I'm not going to read it here uh for the
[2:39:08] people who had to think about it before
[2:39:11] giving a prayer. So for those people
[2:39:14] kindly
[2:39:16] uh before we leave today uh I'm going to
[2:39:19] approach you but if I don't kindly
[2:39:22] approach me or and oh brother Daniel so
[2:39:24] that we can record your pledge that is
[2:39:27] the youth if you are the member of this
[2:39:29] church and and you didn't preach because
[2:39:33] giving is compulsory for you. So um we
[2:39:38] have not recorded uh for today but uh
[2:39:42] briefly here is the report.
[2:39:49] Okay.
[2:39:51] [Music]
[2:39:52] So uh the total amount pledged uh was uh
[2:39:56] 12 million so far 12 12,960,000
[2:40:06] So I think we can clap for ourselves for
[2:40:09] that.
[2:40:11] [Music]
[2:40:13] Okay. So
[2:40:16] so far uh the amount that we have paid
[2:40:20] it is um 859,000.
[2:40:25] [Music]
[2:40:29] So um that leaves us with a balance of
[2:40:33] uh about uh still around 12 million. So
[2:40:37] kindly let's have that cleared. Uh but
[2:40:41] so far we need to to pay
[2:40:45] uh the deposit to the venue uh which is
[2:40:48] likely to be not less than 3 million. So
[2:40:52] uh let us join our hands this week and
[2:40:55] uh give so that we shall have it cleared
[2:40:57] in the course of the week. Otherwise uh
[2:41:00] thank you so much. God bless you.
[2:41:06] God bless you. We had there's quite a
[2:41:08] number of of people going to be coming
[2:41:11] from other countries to come and and be
[2:41:14] a part of this um youth camp.
[2:41:17] Um
[2:41:19] I've not yet confirmed with the brothers
[2:41:21] but I heard that could be more than 60
[2:41:24] coming from Kenya most likely more than
[2:41:27] 70 because that the ones that I'm
[2:41:29] telling you are from Nairobi but I've
[2:41:31] not talked about western Kenya and the
[2:41:32] other places where they usually come
[2:41:34] from so we would not want to have all
[2:41:38] those people come and we've not prepared
[2:41:40] for them. Let us prepare for them. Let
[2:41:42] us be serious with this. This is our
[2:41:44] vision and it's it's working because it
[2:41:47] it is being a blessing not only to those
[2:41:49] people who come in the in the camp but
[2:41:51] also to us as a church and and also to
[2:41:54] our young people here you and also in
[2:41:57] the country. So let us try to do our
[2:41:58] best to give towards that. Um,
[2:42:03] if you want to be blessed in the work of
[2:42:06] your hands, usually when you see
[2:42:08] something come up as in the line of
[2:42:10] serving God,
[2:42:13] be in that. G, give as much as you can
[2:42:15] give and the Lord will always bless you.
[2:42:17] There's no shame on me telling you that
[2:42:20] because that's the way of God. It's the
[2:42:22] way of the word. Amen. And to those of
[2:42:24] you who pledged to the land fund,
[2:42:27] please, like I said in the beginning,
[2:42:28] try to always every week get something
[2:42:31] every week. And whatever else that is
[2:42:33] big that you are planning to get, you
[2:42:34] will get and also you bring. But for
[2:42:36] now, before you get the big blessing,
[2:42:38] give the little that you have. Don't let
[2:42:40] leave all your pledge to remain there.
[2:42:42] It's like the the widow woman bringing
[2:42:44] her um vessels and and the prophet tells
[2:42:47] her begin powering in oil. And she says
[2:42:49] the oil is little. It will not finish.
[2:42:51] She said no, begin powering. Just obey
[2:42:53] and do what you're told to do and see
[2:42:54] what God will do. Amen.
[2:42:57] Um, Sister Rose, I've been told she
[2:42:59] wants to say something. Uh, we can have
[2:43:01] a come.
[2:43:04] [Music]
[2:43:30] I'm standing here to thank God
[2:43:34] and to thank the brethren.
[2:43:38] I thank God for the gift of life.
[2:43:43] The life I've gone through in the couple
[2:43:45] of days before has not been easy.
[2:43:48] [Music]
[2:43:52] Problems, big problems have come and
[2:43:55] have been mightier than my life.
[2:44:00] But above all, I thank God for the
[2:44:02] brethren that have stood with me
[2:44:05] that I have gone through those problems.
[2:44:08] They have not been easy
[2:44:12] because we lost all our parents.
[2:44:17] So we are the only elderly people
[2:44:19] remaining.
[2:44:21] So whatever happens at home, I need to
[2:44:24] be there.
[2:44:26] Our
[2:44:29] first brother who died, he just died
[2:44:31] abruptly without getting sick.
[2:44:42] They brought him on a motorcycle and
[2:44:44] they were telling the mother that find
[2:44:46] out whether this person is still alive
[2:44:51] because all our fathers died. We only
[2:44:54] have mothers.
[2:45:02] He got a little bit sick when they took
[2:45:05] him to the hospital. They sent him to
[2:45:06] the main hospital in Chiboga.
[2:45:11] But as reaching the hospital, he just
[2:45:14] died off.
[2:45:20] So they didn't know what to do. They
[2:45:22] said, "Let us go to the mother and find
[2:45:23] out whether he's really dead or he's
[2:45:25] still living."
[2:45:29] Mother just had two motorcycles standing
[2:45:31] in the courtyard and
[2:45:35] he was saying, "Come and check this one.
[2:45:37] We don't know.
[2:45:40] Truly truly he was dead."
[2:45:44] So we buried him.
[2:45:49] Within the same moment there was a
[2:45:51] ceremony which was prepared. It was for
[2:45:53] my sister
[2:45:57] she was going to have intro I think
[2:45:59] marriage ceremony.
[2:46:03] So they had told us to come over.
[2:46:08] So that Saturday morning we went over.
[2:46:11] [Music]
[2:46:14] because we were returning in the night.
[2:46:16] Then we got news about the death of our
[2:46:18] other brother.
[2:46:21] [Music]
[2:46:27] Most of my related brothers had news
[2:46:29] that don't switch off your phones. This
[2:46:31] person is really very ill.
[2:46:38] I was coming to church. I had almost
[2:46:40] reached N. I saw a message
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; that Captain Michael had died.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; As I reached agenda,

[2:46:55] she was really crying bitterly.
[2:47:01] Mommy, my brother's died even without
[2:47:03] getting sick.
[2:47:09] At the same time we were burying in

[2:47:13] were also burying another relative.
[2:47:17] We were we are in funeral also in
[2:47:20] funeral.
[2:47:22] It was really very difficult for me as
[2:47:25] an elderly person
[2:47:28] and I did not know even where to go.
[2:47:33] But I thank God's grace when I informed
[2:47:35] the brethren here.
[2:47:37] There some brethren who gave me some
[2:47:39] money.
[2:47:41] [Music]
[2:47:43] I managed to go to Mago where the casket
[2:47:46] was sorry where the body was.
[2:47:53] I learned something very great that
[2:47:54] amidst this life we are in death.

[2:48:00] We went with brother Peter. He went with
[2:48:02] me.

[2:48:10] But he just said I can't believe I I
[2:48:12] feel I cannot breathe. I feel I cannot
[2:48:14] breathe. And then he died off.
[2:48:17] And they just took to the hospital a
[2:48:19] dead body.
[2:48:21] to check exactly what what really caused
[2:48:24] the death.
[2:48:25] [Music]
[2:48:28] He said that he got three clothes in the
[2:48:30] heart.
[2:48:32] He was 35 years old.
[2:48:37] Brethren, if we are born again, let us
[2:48:40] repent and walk right
[2:48:43] because amidst this life, we are under
[2:48:45] death.

[2:49:44] had left me off.

[2:49:50] to go back. It was around 7 in the
