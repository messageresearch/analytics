[9:11] and I am Pastor babzi your host now at
[9:15] the bench today we have a very
[9:16] interesting person uh Reverend Richard
[9:19] Steven ibal as a senior pastor at even
[9:22] inav Veil uh Ministries in ginger uh
[9:26] Pastor Stephen is one of our elders here
[9:28] in Uganda
[9:30] and for over 40 years he's been I think
[9:34] specifically about 44 years in Ministry
[9:37] and so he has too much experience and
[9:40] for us especially as the Young
[9:42] Generation to draw from and I thought
[9:44] that this would not only be a resource
[9:47] for the Youth uh but also a blessing to
[9:50] the more mature
[9:52] Believers to be able to draw
[9:54] from and so man of God we are so blessed
[9:57] to have you today at the bench thank you
[10:00] I'd like you to maybe take a moment and
[10:02] greet the viewers think you look over
[10:04] this camera uh God bless you all that
[10:08] are viewing now as you've already heard
[10:12] my name is stepen IAL
[10:15] and I am a minister at the inner Veil
[10:19] Tabernacle which falls under the inner
[10:21] Veil
[10:22] Ministries and um I trust the Lord will
[10:26] bless our interaction today amen
[10:29] so it's a a real a real honor to have
[10:31] you and I know even before we invited
[10:34] you we had uh several uh I I was
[10:38] thinking about inviting you in my in my
[10:40] mind uh but I had not yet done so but
[10:43] then some young people came to me they
[10:44] said who will be next are you inviting
[10:46] Pastor Steven to me I said that is a
[10:48] confirmation thank you so much so the
[10:50] Lord knew that this would happen today
[10:52] yeah and so would like to start it off
[10:54] uh with um a
[10:57] question on how how did you come to the
[11:01] knowledge of the message of the hour um
[11:04] well the way I came to the knowledge of
[11:07] the message of the hour is very
[11:10] interesting because the hours
[11:14] 1977 I came to know about the message
[11:19] because in the circles Pentecostal
[11:21] circles where I was there was a a very
[11:26] strong wind that was going
[11:29] around about what they called a cout uh
[11:34] that were thinking like they were going
[11:36] in the Rapture in 1977 on you know the
[11:40] month of July and the seventh day and
[11:43] the seventh Mee everything was
[11:46] 777 So eventually it didn't happen and
[11:50] it was very big talk in the Pentecostal
[11:53] circles where I was so that's when I
[11:56] first heard of the message actually in
[11:59] the
[12:00] negative and uh it was there 1978 now um
[12:06] just as I was going around doing my work
[12:10] as a witness uh for Christ in the town
[12:13] of tororo I came up you know across
[12:17] those people then for the first time I
[12:20] was
[12:21] confronted with the message directly
[12:24] that was in 1978 a year later so how old
[12:27] were you then I was 20 and already a
[12:31] minister yeah so then how did you become
[12:33] a Christian um I first came across the
[12:38] gospel as I knew it when I was really
[12:41] very young that was in
[12:43] 1971 because I was brought up in a
[12:47] Pentecostal background and in
[12:50] 1974 I committed my life to Christ as I
[12:54] knew then so that's how I became a
[12:57] Christian it was
[12:59] first uh you know January of
[13:04] 1974 and it was up on tank mua that's
[13:08] where I committed my life to Christ
[13:11] right here in Cala in kalala that was
[13:14] under which movement at the time I know
[13:15] there are many Pentecostal maybe
[13:17] Pentecostal movements at that time at
[13:19] that time you know uh
[13:23] incidentally it was a group of young men
[13:28] that had come out from the ministry of a
[13:32] man they used to call John yoa obiri and
[13:37] some of those people that projected out
[13:40] of there you can talk about a few like
[13:43] uh Caya I mean like there was his older
[13:47] brother called David makumbi and then
[13:51] we've got uh uh s inba and different
[13:56] ones but at that time uh I was
[13:59] associating with Peterson so and then a
[14:04] man who was called balinda under the
[14:06] redeemed gospel church okay yeah so then
[14:10] now in
[14:11] 1977 you leave campala and go to toroto
[14:16] yeah in
[14:18] 1977 I practically went to toroto just
[14:22] because I believed in winning souls okay
[14:25] yeah so that's what I basically went to
[14:28] do toor to kind of reach out for Christ
[14:31] so by this time you've been uh not only
[14:34] a Christian for some time but a minister
[14:36] for like maybe how many years uh that
[14:38] time I was projecting out into being a
[14:41] minister then that was the first year I
[14:44] was out ministering in 1978 yeah okay
[14:49] and well it is amazing that for about
[14:51] one or two years you you you know in in
[14:55] Ministry but you already had a burden
[14:57] and a desire to go take what the light
[15:00] as you you had it at that time to other
[15:02] areas that's right because um uh brother
[15:06] B when I get you back to my roots um
[15:11] you'll find that uh uh our family was
[15:16] deeply rooted uh in the Pentecostal
[15:19] movement and we've got a mega church
[15:22] right there where my father uh you know
[15:26] we we built a church right there so I
[15:29] I've been a big part of church you know
[15:32] most of my life yeah well that that is
[15:37] um interesting God doesn't just call
[15:39] anybody you know like you can see that
[15:41] he had the Levites and he was calling
[15:42] out of those to go and Serve the People
[15:45] yeah and so um now in 1977 the message
[15:49] so you go to tororo to take the light
[15:52] the word of God as you knew it then yeah
[15:55] and then something happened that you
[15:57] happened yes uh when I was in tororo and
[16:00] then I was moving from house to house um
[16:04] I found this little group of about 15
[16:08] people and they were in
[16:10] Fellowship so I heard them sing I heard
[16:14] my
[16:15] Bible I walked in and uh I was invited
[16:20] and you know to seat quite at the front
[16:24] and they asked me who I was I told them
[16:27] who I was and there was an Old Gentleman
[16:32] they used to call him Pell Philly okay
[16:35] he was of a malawian citizenship who had
[16:39] settled here in Uganda and he had the
[16:42] background of his ministry with mson bzy
[16:46] so uh he was in Uganda because he
[16:50] believed he had received the message so
[16:53] he was preaching basically two major
[16:58] doct
[16:59] one was come out of her my people okay
[17:02] and two baptism in Jesus name and of
[17:06] course the godhead that was all and um
[17:10] so these people asked me uh that why
[17:13] don't you stand and share with us the
[17:15] word and that was my delight I picked my
[17:18] Bible and I remember I went into the
[17:21] text of Eli a priest with a deeming eye
[17:26] and so after I preached my
[17:28] out uh they they really appreciated me
[17:32] and uh as I sat down one of the younger
[17:35] men you know in his
[17:38] shorts uh asked me unto what were you
[17:43] baptized and you know what that young
[17:46] man happens to be brother Charles oio oh
[17:49] my God
[17:50] yeah you know uh and then as I started
[17:56] trying to present my
[17:59] myself uh you know my faith and you know
[18:03] trying to defend the Trinity and the
[18:06] baptism I was losing it but honestly at
[18:09] that moment I was sure that I was being
[18:14] confronted by these people that uh uh
[18:18] you know they were talking about quite a
[18:20] lot yeah you know that's very
[18:22] interesting especially you know many
[18:24] people ask me say how about these other
[18:27] people who are not in the message
[18:28] how will you know how will God judge
[18:30] them and I always say God has a way of
[18:32] bringing the light of the word to them
[18:36] yeah because you see you went you know
[18:37] with fire with the light that you had to
[18:40] minister to these people and they even
[18:41] let you preach to them that was very
[18:43] gracious of them and then right there
[18:46] you were asked a question you know unto
[18:48] what then were you baptized yeah so how
[18:51] did the day end that's where it started
[18:54] and so I found out that whatever
[18:57] scripture
[18:58] uh that represented the Trinity the way
[19:01] I understood was knocked down in that
[19:04] small meeting MH and uh you know I I was
[19:09] a little bit confused and I said are you
[19:13] the
[19:16] bramit so tell me about your knowledge
[19:18] of the branhamites so-called at that
[19:21] time among the Pentecostal cirs yeah it
[19:23] was just uh a people that were duped
[19:28] okay and uh to believe that they were
[19:30] going into the Rapture okay uh in July
[19:34] of 1977 okay and that's all you know it
[19:38] was they printed a tract at that time
[19:41] which was being distributed in the
[19:44] churches it was Yu Yu you know uh don't
[19:49] talk back Yu yuck don't talk back
[19:54] meaning that you know you shouldn't
[19:56] really answer those people when you come
[19:59] across them and U then they printed
[20:02] another tract they called it spiritual
[20:05] Pi Pockets
[20:08] so you know so you know I try to
[20:12] Resource you know whatever uh material I
[20:15] would re remember from that but uh these
[20:19] people were world best and so you know I
[20:24] asked them confronted them about 1977
[20:28] then MH so they said 1977 we are not
[20:32] going to answer you directly but we have
[20:35] a book okay and this is the book go and
[20:39] read it you'll come across the
[20:42] 1977 and you know what it was the
[20:45] seventh Church edge book wow my I took
[20:48] the book maybe the brother can Flash
[20:50] that seventh Church ede book on the
[20:51] screen for the people yeah uh and I fed
[20:54] on it uh brother you know I I spent
[20:58] about two weeks reading that book and uh
[21:04] I was just wanting to get into where I
[21:08] can get the questions but you know it
[21:10] was so scripture based and uh by the
[21:15] time I finished the church Ed book I
[21:18] thought I
[21:20] thought there couldn't be anything
[21:23] better than this so then I went back uh
[21:27] to this people and uh they told me well
[21:32] we can give you some more so they gave
[21:34] me the seventh Church hede book and it
[21:37] helped me bring me into the
[21:40] understanding of the prophetic season
[21:42] where we are so uh it just kind of
[21:46] knocked me out and in October
[21:51] 1978 we had to Trail a creek because it
[21:54] was a hot season and most of the water
[21:58] water bodies were were were were were
[22:02] dry so we followed a water creek with
[22:06] brother Dio into the woods and we found
[22:10] a pond which was deep enough uh for me
[22:14] to fit in and I was baptized that year
[22:17] amen praise the name of the Lord and
[22:20] that was the beginning of a great
[22:21] journey because now we can be able to
[22:23] look back and say ah that was the
[22:25] beginning of a great journey then you
[22:27] did not perhaps know it would be a great
[22:29] journey no I didn't know at all and I
[22:31] always think that the ministry is
[22:34] submission to the leadership of God yes
[22:37] because this is the way God used even
[22:39] The Messengers they never knew who they
[22:42] were but they were men who had been
[22:44] subjected to the leadership of the Holy
[22:46] Spirit and every step they took was
[22:49] forain of God and I think uh this
[22:53] happens to be you know on you also and
[22:56] me we just do not know what would be we
[23:00] just discover we are getting involved
[23:03] with quite a lot in the kingdom and I
[23:05] think that's what actually defines the
[23:08] ministry is not knowing whom you think
[23:10] you are but is submitting to the
[23:13] leadership of the holy spirit that it
[23:16] takes you to the ordained fields that
[23:18] you were supposed to be part of in the
[23:21] Harvest amen so that's how interesting
[23:24] it was because at that time um
[23:28] this gentleman came independently into
[23:31] the country and uh he was sowing seed
[23:35] but then little did we know there was
[23:39] another group that was started out in
[23:42] tesso Courage you know and then
[23:45] different brothers were up there and
[23:47] then some of them that when the teaching
[23:50] profession came to throw GS and for the
[23:53] first time in 1980 we were able to meet
[23:57] yeah it was just like you know Saul
[24:01] after believing going into the Arabian
[24:03] Desert and then after some time he meets
[24:07] with the Brethren uh from uh uh I mean
[24:10] in Jerusalem so these were two different
[24:15] uh sources okay of the message coming
[24:19] into the country okay yeah oh so because
[24:22] we've had the other version of toroto
[24:24] girls um of um t t College and then this
[24:28] is another Channel through which the
[24:30] message also came into the country yeah
[24:31] it's completely another Channel okay
[24:34] yeah well that that's news for me as
[24:36] well I know that complete another
[24:38] Channel now I uh before we leave this
[24:41] part of of your testimony and I would
[24:44] want to specifically have you answer one
[24:48] question please the question that you
[24:50] had at the time because perhaps there
[24:52] might be someone listening H that has
[24:54] the same question or maybe they just
[24:56] stumble they may stumble on this video
[24:58] and maybe they have the same question
[25:00] are you
[25:01] Brites you ask them that question yeah
[25:04] and no doubt you receive the answer
[25:06] because there are people that have
[25:07] ascribed this message to Branham
[25:10] branhamism or people who are just simply
[25:12] following
[25:14] Branham um what would be your answer to
[25:18] such people and how would you help them
[25:20] understand what you understood um I
[25:23] think this is my
[25:25] view that uh there is a tenden of
[25:28] branding people yes and uh some of the
[25:32] people have accepted the brand yes you
[25:36] know you talk about the lutherans yes
[25:39] simply because they said yes to Luther's
[25:42] message yes and then we've got uh the
[25:47] whelans yes yes because they said yes to
[25:51] Wes's message MH and uh you know a lot
[25:55] of this goes on too
[25:58] uh you know with the outside world
[26:02] towards us M uh they want to do exactly
[26:06] the same branding to us yeah to us like
[26:09] they did to the Ruther and the different
[26:12] groups that they have done uh brother BS
[26:15] let me say this um I would not want to
[26:20] be called a bromite MH because that's
[26:22] not what I am that's not what I am yeah
[26:25] yeah I'm a Christian amen and uh that's
[26:28] what I am you normally the people who
[26:31] brand they are trying to be negative
[26:35] towards you yeah it's the same Spirit it
[26:39] SPS into the message of the hour and
[26:42] then we begin to Brand one another
[26:46] simply because maybe this group is uh uh
[26:50] so much interested in approaching the
[26:54] message from a different uh you know
[26:57] know uh springboard you know sometimes
[27:01] from the baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[27:04] sometime from the the seven Thunders or
[27:09] sometimes from this so we end up
[27:11] branding one another I think that's not
[27:14] the best thing to do in the message yeah
[27:17] because actually even uh Prophet or the
[27:20] one that we call Brother Bram yeah he
[27:22] actually said that he never brought a
[27:24] message to get a following or get people
[27:26] to his church or to follow him or
[27:29] believe in him yeah but he he was
[27:31] wanting people to have a personal
[27:33] relationship with Christ exactly because
[27:36] the purpose of this message was the
[27:39] revelation of Christ so if you get me
[27:44] branded uh you better brand me you know
[27:48] being a Christian amen because that's
[27:50] the main you know article of the message
[27:55] the main purpose and I always tell the
[27:58] people if we do not have the revelation
[28:01] of Christ now then the ministry of the
[28:04] Prophet failed exactly because that was
[28:07] the purpose why he came it was the
[28:08] purpose yeah to introduce Christ to us
[28:11] so you know uh and just like John the
[28:14] Baptist was he also said that I would
[28:17] rather decrease and increases so the
[28:19] greater object was brought to us and if
[28:22] you have to Brand me brand Me by Christ
[28:25] amen that would be the best amen so I be
[28:28] right to say that all the
[28:30] denominations TOs and their rations but
[28:34] only this message that really points
[28:36] people to Christ that's what should be
[28:38] and that's what it is yeah our focus is
[28:42] Christ amen yeah amen well thank you so
[28:47] much for that um uh for that inspiration
[28:49] I know it will help quite a lot of young
[28:51] people especially those who have been
[28:53] struggling to understand what is this
[28:54] message all about thank you yeah and and
[28:57] so then now this is 1978 and then you
[29:01] get baptized in toroto and then how do
[29:05] how do you then carry on how did you do
[29:07] you now enter into Ministry in the
[29:09] message now how do I enter the ministry
[29:14] in the message this is very interesting
[29:17] because uh uh right from
[29:20] there uh had studied
[29:23] enough to get a
[29:26] turnaround you you know a man who has
[29:28] gone through the major works of the
[29:32] Prophet you know uh especially when I'm
[29:36] trying because I have to give you this
[29:39] good springboard but when I'm getting my
[29:43] ministers trained the first thing I do I
[29:46] buy them a new Bible yeah and uh I would
[29:50] require them to read that Bible because
[29:54] if I give them I mean if they they read
[29:58] their own you cannot be sure it has been
[30:01] read from cover to cover but if I give
[30:04] you a new one sure you've read your
[30:06] Bible from cover to cover so the second
[30:10] book I give them is the seven Church
[30:13] book because that contains all the
[30:17] teaching yes of the message message
[30:20] basically that's the compressed work you
[30:24] know that actually introduces some
[30:27] to the message after that somebody needs
[30:31] to understand the prophetic season where
[30:33] he lives I give them the seven seal book
[30:37] yeah and after that I give them the book
[30:40] of Hebrews yes so that they can be able
[30:43] to understand the doctrine of redemption
[30:46] yeah you see that's where it's really
[30:49] compressed in the book of Hebrews and
[30:52] then afterwards I give them the two
[30:55] volumes questions and answers yeah yeah
[30:58] so then I come back so then after that
[31:02] and I had studied deeply uh the message
[31:07] uh I started preaching it in my former
[31:11] organization until 1980 when I was
[31:15] kicked
[31:17] out you know uh we used to have big
[31:21] meetings and uh the people loved my
[31:25] teaching MH uh uh the problem comes when
[31:30] I started using the name of brother
[31:33] Branham so uh they come up a committee
[31:38] of
[31:39] ministers yeah about 20 or so and uh
[31:43] they wanted me to answer a few questions
[31:46] MH so you know they would come up with
[31:50] this question before I'm in the middle
[31:53] of it another one is asking from what
[31:56] I'm saying and then
[31:57] eventually I couldn't even be able to
[32:00] talk to them I looked at them MH I said
[32:04] nothing so from
[32:07] 1980 I was kicked out and that's where
[32:11] my journey of purely preaching the
[32:14] message begins from yeah and that's the
[32:17] year when I met my wife and we married
[32:22] in May of
[32:24] 1980 on the 17th day yeah actually I was
[32:28] just about my next question I was about
[32:30] to ask you how did you um you know uh
[32:34] for you to tell us about how you found
[32:36] the love of your life uh Mama Sarah yeah
[32:41] ah you know uh Sarah was one of those uh
[32:45] young people who used to come uh to that
[32:50] group you know and uh she really loved
[32:53] my Ministry mhm and uh a few of them
[32:57] one of them is uh the present wife of
[33:02] brother chario okay because she's Elder
[33:06] to my wife okay and then another person
[33:09] was brother
[33:11] Beno actually when I came out he was my
[33:14] first candidate that I baptized okay
[33:17] brother Beno that was in 1980 okay and
[33:21] then uh uh you know I met my wife and uh
[33:28] we kind of proposed to one another she
[33:31] accepted we were very young people but I
[33:35] was looking at myself as a person that
[33:38] was going out into the ministry um with
[33:42] the kind of uh family I came from looked
[33:46] like I had disappointed them because I
[33:49] was supposed to continue with my
[33:52] education but as I read the seven Church
[33:55] ages I mean the Seven Seals I was like a
[34:00] Paul you know Paul lived every day
[34:04] believing he was going the following day
[34:07] exactly yeah he he would say those of us
[34:09] who are still alive and I honestly
[34:12] believed that and I said well I need
[34:16] company of my wife and because after all
[34:20] we are not going to have children MH
[34:22] because time is far spent then
[34:25] eventually the children came
[34:29] I said well they not go to school and
[34:32] then he finally they came to going I
[34:34] mean to the age of going to school I
[34:37] said well they will never finish they
[34:39] finished and now they are married women
[34:42] four of them and I've got seven
[34:45] grandchildren wow so you know it's a
[34:48] very interesting way but we live this
[34:50] life one day at a time yeah yeah that's
[34:53] what matters most amen I I believe many
[34:56] young young people like me uh who are
[34:58] listening to this cuz we have quite a
[35:00] number following on YouTube I'm I
[35:03] believe they would want to say when I
[35:04] grow up I want to be like you
[35:06] Pastor yeah sometimes people say so and
[35:10] they say I would like to be like you
[35:13] simply because they are seeing me now
[35:15] yes but they're not ready to do the
[35:17] sacrifice that you but if they saw me
[35:20] then they would respect Sister Sarah so
[35:23] much yes you know because she got
[35:26] married to nothing exactly you know
[35:29] nothing she just married the love of
[35:32] Christ that's so and um I really
[35:35] appreciate and appreciate her so much
[35:38] and I think you have a way of answering
[35:40] my questions before I ask you because my
[35:42] next question was why is why in your
[35:45] opinion is it increasingly difficult for
[35:47] young people now to start or and to keep
[35:50] the to keep marriage their
[35:54] marriages um there are quite a number of
[35:56] things things that affect marriages
[36:00] today uh first of
[36:04] all the reason why they marry mhm that's
[36:08] very very
[36:10] important uh you are a
[36:13] pastor and uh how
[36:16] many weddings have you had in church
[36:18] here so far well our church has been
[36:21] three years so we had one wedding one
[36:23] wedding and we having others this year
[36:24] yeah I want you to notice
[36:27] the next wedding that
[36:29] comes it may and must be bigger than the
[36:34] one you just had sure you know there is
[36:38] a way of competition yes among the young
[36:41] people yes you know if one marries a
[36:44] girl with this beauty you know
[36:48] prescription another would really like
[36:50] to find one that would equally compete
[36:54] or surpass yeah so you find that the
[36:57] reason why the young people are marrying
[37:00] today yeah is not you know for them to
[37:05] really be the beginning of the church
[37:07] because families is a cell of the major
[37:12] Church M uh God identifies himself with
[37:18] families when he created Adam and Eve he
[37:23] created them on a family specific a mhm
[37:28] and even in times when there is chaos
[37:32] and stuff you know God always desires to
[37:36] work together with families you know
[37:39] Rahab you know she was able to pick the
[37:42] token for the family uh you remember the
[37:46] man who was in prison and uh you know
[37:48] God came down and the light when I mean
[37:53] Paul and Silas were in prison you know
[37:55] the light came down down and the chains
[37:57] fell and the Jailer wanted to kill
[38:00] himself says no don't you know he says
[38:03] we are all here so he desired to have
[38:06] the god of these men and the answer was
[38:10] you shall be saved and your house so God
[38:14] literally uh you know created this
[38:18] nature based on family specification if
[38:23] I can say like that I'll give you an
[38:26] example
[38:27] here that um uh in Ephesians 5 you know
[38:32] when the family is broken down you know
[38:36] it is uh taken on a parallel of Christ
[38:39] and the church so if a man or a woman
[38:45] wants to marry he must be willing to be
[38:49] taking that symbol back home with him of
[38:52] Christ and the church now if both of
[38:55] them uh do their best to
[39:00] replicate what exactly their role is the
[39:03] sister will say well I'm going to study
[39:06] so much and understand what the bride is
[39:09] and then she does her best to bring
[39:12] forth the character of the Bride of the
[39:15] Lord Jesus Christ and the man does his
[39:19] best to bring forth you know the
[39:21] character of Christ then we've got
[39:24] smaller sales of of the church Church
[39:27] from the bigger church but this is not
[39:29] what people are marrying for one they
[39:32] are marrying because they have come to
[39:34] age M two they are marrying because they
[39:37] become too busy yeah they cannot do
[39:40] their clothes anymore so they need a
[39:42] helper they need a cook and they feel
[39:46] like they need to procreate they need
[39:48] some children so you find that entirely
[39:52] the young people today they reason why
[39:56] they marry is fa based on the word and
[40:01] remember God will only defend his word
[40:04] so if he doesn't see the purpose in what
[40:07] you're doing I don't know whether you
[40:09] can really be blessed in it too uh is
[40:12] the social media yeah yeah everything
[40:16] that comes up people have learned to
[40:18] Google they Google about marriages they
[40:20] don't consult pastors anymore so they
[40:23] want to solve their own problems and uh
[40:26] they don't use the ministry to keep them
[40:30] guided in different ways it's completely
[40:34] very difficult so that's the reason why
[40:38] the marriages fail today there's a lot
[40:41] of
[40:42] impatience and uh two
[40:46] also the spirit of the time yeah that's
[40:49] right yeah people are too busy yeah
[40:53] people are looking for money they like
[40:56] lives are always
[40:58] stressed so it has a very big strain on
[41:02] a family
[41:03] relationship
[41:05] yeah well uh maybe for just a moment to
[41:09] you our viewers if you can just please
[41:11] share the link of this YouTube uh uh
[41:15] broadcast let because you see what we're
[41:17] hearing is a lot of wisdom some of the
[41:19] things I'm hearing I myself I'm being
[41:22] impacted by them and I believe that if
[41:23] you can share this it will be don't get
[41:26] don't be selfish you see if you you're
[41:28] blessed by this this wisdom from the man
[41:30] of God please share the link and let
[41:32] others as well come and hear what you're
[41:35] hearing uh I'd like to take you back a
[41:37] little bit uh on the subject of the
[41:40] message yeah um you spoke about you know
[41:44] the very first things first you say that
[41:46] the first thing that you would do or you
[41:47] would do for a person who has come into
[41:49] the message is to give them the Bible no
[41:53] the people who want to get into the
[41:56] Ministry oh oh those who want to get
[41:58] into the ministry all right say say give
[42:00] them the Bible and then next the seven
[42:03] give them the seven Church age book and
[42:06] and and then the other messages like the
[42:08] Hebrews and others yeah so here comes a
[42:11] question and this is a bumb show because
[42:12] it is been overly debated in the message
[42:14] yeah because you you have a lot of
[42:16] people now that say some say well the
[42:19] message and the Bible is different and
[42:24] others said no the message is the Bible
[42:26] and the Bible is the
[42:28] message you have a lot of wisdom and not
[42:31] of your own but because of course you
[42:34] have a calling of God upon your life and
[42:35] a lot of years of
[42:37] experience and no doubt God has blessed
[42:39] your ministry and uh we've seen quite
[42:42] thousands um have come into the message
[42:44] in this country over the years in your
[42:46] ministry what have you
[42:49] taught
[42:51] well brother
[42:54] BS those things
[42:57] come when people have a
[42:59] problem yeah
[43:02] before a man devs a problem he cannot
[43:07] separate
[43:09] Bible and the
[43:11] message to begin
[43:14] with the
[43:16] Bible became a new Bible at the opening
[43:20] of The Seven Seals yeah that the
[43:24] mystery that had
[43:26] being you know hidden from before the
[43:29] foundation of the world was broken with
[43:33] the opening of The Seven Seals now when
[43:37] we talk about the opening of The Seven
[43:39] Seals it's not literally the preaching
[43:43] of the seven seal message MH but the
[43:47] revelation of what exactly Christ was BR
[43:53] the prophet exactly and the pur of the
[43:57] Prophet was to restore the people back
[44:00] to the word now if you find a problem of
[44:06] getting to study the
[44:08] message and you lock yourself to the
[44:11] Bible the Revelation didn't come to you
[44:15] then there's no reason why we needed a
[44:17] prophet you see what I mean exactly so I
[44:20] think any man who really believes this
[44:24] message and believes Revelation 10:7
[44:27] believes Malachi 4 you know he really
[44:31] hold the ministry of the Prophet highly
[44:35] because that was the only Channel by
[44:38] which we could get back to the Bible
[44:41] yeah so we had Bible throughout you know
[44:44] but nobody ever got this which we have
[44:47] yeah you know but this is exactly what
[44:50] happens brother B that in Egypt they
[44:55] were slaves M they were under whips MH
[45:00] and they were under
[45:02] labor and God says I've heard your
[45:05] cry I've seen your
[45:08] afflictions and then he came down by the
[45:12] ministry of a manh that's the only way
[45:15] they could be
[45:16] delivered you know they went into ex I
[45:20] mean into captivity by rejecting the
[45:23] ministry of an anointed man
[45:27] Joseph if they had accepted Joseph it
[45:31] would be Canan that would be the food
[45:34] basket because that's where the wisdom
[45:36] would be but they rejected him and sent
[45:39] him over MH and out there God used him
[45:43] to understand exactly what was going to
[45:46] happen and
[45:48] then even the the family came to Egypt
[45:52] finally MH you know and then they got
[45:54] caught there the the only way they could
[45:56] be delivered was to
[46:00] reverse you see uh was to reverse their
[46:03] kind of stess against the
[46:06] ministry so God sends them Moses and he
[46:10] says Moses go and Moses goes to bring
[46:14] them out but you know when they came out
[46:17] of captivity and that's noral then we we
[46:22] have got different men who come and says
[46:25] we are also a holy man you know and so
[46:29] because they away from captivity they
[46:32] think now it is easier here they want
[46:35] rise up you know and let me tell you it
[46:38] is such a very very very very uh I don't
[46:42] know which words to use it was
[46:46] quite important that the children of
[46:50] Israel obey Moses exactly you see what I
[46:54] mean when they came out of Egypt they
[46:56] come into the Wilderness when they were
[46:59] in the wilderness you know they would do
[47:01] all kinds of things you know and then
[47:04] Moses would stand there in between and
[47:07] God would save them they would do
[47:10] another thing Moses would stand in there
[47:13] God would save them but when they try to
[47:16] reject Moses
[47:18] again Moses couldn't redeem them from
[47:22] that exactly because they were repeating
[47:24] exactly what they did against Joseph and
[47:28] so God says separate yourselves from
[47:31] these
[47:33] men that's when Moses's uh standing in
[47:37] the Gap wouldn't work wouldn't work yeah
[47:39] and then the ground swallowed them so I
[47:43] don't really think it is
[47:46] wisdom uh after you've studied the
[47:49] message and you seem to understand the
[47:53] Bible that you refuse other people to
[47:56] study the message and then you become
[47:59] The Interpreter I think that's not wise
[48:02] yeah the world purpose is let me take
[48:05] the position of the Prophet
[48:07] now and I think this is basically what
[48:10] Pentecostalism has done because many
[48:12] ministers study the message they have a
[48:14] lot of messages packed in their homes on
[48:17] their iPads and tablets they study the
[48:19] me they really study the message but
[48:21] they pick out what they want to preach
[48:23] and then they add their own Revelations
[48:25] upon it and then they bring a a very you
[48:27] know you know good Revelation to the
[48:29] people and the people are like oh he's a
[48:30] man of God he has powerful Revelation
[48:32] yeah but I think the difference between
[48:34] us and the Pentecostal world is we take
[48:36] the message and give it to the people
[48:38] yeah and you cannot separate the man
[48:41] from the message from his message yeah
[48:43] and that's true brother B because in the
[48:46] 70s and the early '90s we had a public
[48:50] library in
[48:52] ginger and uh most of the people that
[48:55] were coming to borrow these books were
[48:58] ministers from other denominations
[49:00] amazing yeah they did they took a lot so
[49:04] you know I think we should be humble
[49:08] enough to accept this ministry which God
[49:13] sent our way mhm amen amen well I see
[49:18] that you cannot be able to take man out
[49:20] of out of the gospel because God has
[49:23] always used man I see even when in the
[49:25] New Testament even when God even when
[49:28] the house of um of Cornelius I believe
[49:31] it was uh praying and crying for God to
[49:34] visit them and to give them Revelation
[49:36] and he sends them a man yeah he could
[49:38] have sent an angel from heaven but he
[49:40] sent he sent them a man he did but the
[49:42] angel didn't have the
[49:45] formula the angel says go down to Peter
[49:48] is in
[49:49] Joba he has the formula yeah so can we
[49:53] say then that this message
[49:56] is the the Bible I've often said this
[49:59] and you can correct me if I'm wrong that
[50:01] the Bible is the absolute but the
[50:03] message is the absolute revelation of
[50:06] the Bible exactly yeah the Bible is the
[50:11] absolute and the absolute does not mean
[50:15] that it takes away the standard of God
[50:18] yeah because the standard of God you
[50:21] know brother branam says he would have
[50:23] used the wind he would have used the Sun
[50:25] but he chose to use man that's the
[50:27] standard so much as this is absolute it
[50:32] doesn't take away the human Ministry you
[50:35] see what I mean otherwise the people
[50:37] would stay there and just study the
[50:39] Bible and don't come to church yeah you
[50:43] know that you know uh uh because when
[50:46] God deals with us God is dealing with
[50:50] the body you see what I mean yeah I
[50:53] don't believe in a man
[50:56] being saved and hases not become part of
[50:59] the body because every joint must Supply
[51:04] you know you must stand in somewhere and
[51:08] be able to minister as because generally
[51:13] we need to go back to uh to
[51:17] real uh
[51:20] fundamentals um we need to know what a
[51:24] son of God is MHM that's very important
[51:30] because when the Son of God was created
[51:33] he was given a body to live in mhm so
[51:37] the Son of God is that seed
[51:41] Gene that God put in your body you know
[51:46] and that seed Gene comes from a
[51:50] multitude of other genes that are
[51:54] connected to the par gen which is God
[51:57] himself so when God creates men there is
[52:02] a way that he keeps bringing them
[52:06] together and making them function
[52:09] together as a body you see anybody who
[52:12] really says I've got the revelation of
[52:15] the word and is totally separating me
[52:17] away from the rest of the part of the
[52:19] body I think there is a very big problem
[52:23] with that person exactly because church
[52:25] is about the body MH you know so you
[52:29] cannot say now I know what I'm supposed
[52:32] to uh to to believe so I can separate
[52:35] myself and study the Bible
[52:39] MH and uh now I don't need the types and
[52:43] or you can even say now I know what I'm
[52:46] supposed to believe I've got the types I
[52:48] cannot come to church you are completely
[52:51] destroying the concept that the prophet
[52:54] himself built amen you know and with all
[52:58] this kind of thing like we've struck a
[53:00] junction this is the final Junction
[53:03] brother there's not any other Junction
[53:05] there's no greater than Malachi 4
[53:08] because all the the the Mysteries are
[53:10] revealed you know we are not building
[53:14] more Mysteries so that we can also turn
[53:16] out to be
[53:18] revealers exactly you see so we are
[53:21] dealing with the revealed message there
[53:23] is no other Junction this is the final
[53:26] one it's a finished work yeah yeah so uh
[53:29] speaking about separating from the rest
[53:32] of the body uh then there's something
[53:36] that uh uh you know just came to my mind
[53:40] as you saying that uh you find that uh
[53:44] brother bam said that when they
[53:45] denominate they
[53:47] die um would I be right to say that
[53:50] there is also some kind of level of a
[53:54] denomination Spirit creeping into the
[53:56] message whereby whereby some some person
[53:59] will you know maybe say I have a revel
[54:02] we have a revelation of this and we're
[54:04] the only right ones and that even to the
[54:06] extent that some people may even be
[54:08] afraid to go to go join others in a
[54:11] convention to go you know fellowship
[54:13] with others and they don't even respect
[54:15] other ministers it's only their
[54:17] ministers their pastors their church
[54:19] because they have it all they have the
[54:21] Revelation that's a very big problem
[54:23] brother B
[54:26] um when Believers begin to think like
[54:29] that we have been given uh you
[54:33] know uh what I would call living
[54:38] examples um we can go back to the seven
[54:43] churches that were in Asia
[54:46] Minor these
[54:49] churches they were seven and a small
[54:53] parcel of land brother the Branham says
[54:55] 7 7 square mile piece of
[55:00] land and
[55:03] uh when
[55:05] we come
[55:07] to interact with what those churches
[55:10] were you find that they were all
[55:14] basically answerable to one living
[55:16] Apostle yeah and that's John the
[55:19] Apostle but when you
[55:23] look at the their
[55:26] exploits their victories were not
[55:30] uniform and their weaknesses were not
[55:33] uniform yeah but yet they were under one
[55:37] Ministry I want to say that when you
[55:41] unify
[55:43] churches
[55:45] by trying to build uh a
[55:49] consensus in Doctrine and delivery you
[55:54] destroy the people people mhm because
[55:56] the challenges are not the same from
[55:58] local church to another exactly so when
[56:01] the message was sent over to one local
[56:04] church it was unto the Church of
[56:09] Ephesus so Ephesus received the message
[56:13] but at the end you know he that has an
[56:19] let him hear what the spirit says to the
[56:22] churches so the victor of eus became a
[56:27] teaching example to the rest of the
[56:29] churches you understand what I mean yeah
[56:32] so Ephesus would become a teaching
[56:37] example I think this is also what we
[56:40] should be we are not talking about
[56:42] uniformity in character in the church we
[56:46] are saying that God uses the church here
[56:49] inongo in a different way he uses us
[56:53] down in ginger in totally different way
[56:56] but then whatsoever we have is very very
[57:01] applicable and necessary for the church
[57:04] in namugongo amen yeah exactly the same
[57:07] way what the church in namugongo has is
[57:10] literally important for us because they
[57:14] come as testimony of their Victory this
[57:18] group comes as testimony of their
[57:21] Victory and that group comes and you see
[57:24] as long long as it is the holy spirit
[57:28] there will not be any form of friction
[57:30] amen amen yeah that's right it will not
[57:32] be any form of friction wherever there
[57:34] is friction then you know the car of man
[57:38] has a play in it yeah we are called to
[57:42] be a body and uh you know we are not
[57:46] called just like I always say brother
[57:49] bass I want you to note this that
[57:53] God is a wealthy
[57:57] godh in
[57:59] design so for example talk about the
[58:03] fruits how many
[58:06] thousands of edible fruits do we have in
[58:09] the
[58:10] world they taste
[58:12] different they've got a different
[58:16] shape they've got a different uh uh you
[58:20] know
[58:22] lifespan different one from another he's
[58:26] a god of multiple
[58:29] varieties when you get all different
[58:32] bananas for
[58:33] example they are totally different taste
[58:37] different this so God even in making men
[58:41] he makes black he makes white he makes
[58:45] yellow you know but even in the black
[58:50] Among Us he makes different designs like
[58:54] like in the church here you are the only
[58:57] you and in the world you are the only
[59:00] one who has got this thumb print
[59:02] billions will be tested and nobody will
[59:05] come forth with your thumb print so so
[59:07] there is no need then for competition
[59:09] that somebody's going to take my place
[59:11] yeah that's where I'm going there is
[59:13] nothing like competition in the body you
[59:16] are just fitting in where God has
[59:18] blessed you you know God will and has
[59:23] never duplicated anybody
[59:26] until all those seed gen that were in
[59:29] him are complete then he can take us all
[59:32] together as a body see what I mean amen
[59:35] yeah so we really need to kind of rest
[59:39] that when God calls you to work a
[59:41] certain way do what God has called you
[59:44] to do and don't waste your time
[59:47] criticizing another brother because God
[59:49] has called him to do the way he does it
[59:51] that's right you see and that's the
[59:54] problem that we have today that a man
[59:57] has hundreds of people sitting in front
[59:59] of him but he has got enough time to
[1:00:02] criticize some other people which are
[1:00:04] about 1,000 miles away from him so uh I
[1:00:09] think we need to grow out of that amen
[1:00:13] and I think I'll just say while a pastor
[1:00:15] takes a siep of water just speak to you
[1:00:18] young ministers especially that are
[1:00:20] following um this uh interview today
[1:00:24] there there is no reason to criticize
[1:00:25] others there is no reason to feel like
[1:00:27] somebody else is taking your place we've
[1:00:29] had a pastor tell us you see if God
[1:00:31] called you just follow the leadership of
[1:00:33] the Holy Spirit do what the Holy Spirit
[1:00:35] tells you to do and if we all did that
[1:00:38] then I'm telling you that we would do a
[1:00:40] lot of damage to the kingdom of darkness
[1:00:42] but I think the problem that we have
[1:00:44] especially with the young generation is
[1:00:46] We are Becoming copycats everybody wants
[1:00:48] to do what somebody else is doing and
[1:00:51] when somebody does something they feel
[1:00:52] like oh they they're going going ahead
[1:00:54] of me I need to rush after them I need
[1:00:56] to catch up with them there is no
[1:00:58] catching up with anybody you know be who
[1:01:00] God has called you to to be can I say
[1:01:02] something also and if I ever try to make
[1:01:09] every Minister like
[1:01:11] myself then I'm killing the varet of the
[1:01:14] calling of God Amen that's right yeah
[1:01:18] and I tell my ministers back home that
[1:01:21] they do not need to be like me mhm
[1:01:25] because they are not me they've got a
[1:01:27] different calling when brother James
[1:01:30] katumba stands to minister totally
[1:01:33] different from me m so it's very
[1:01:36] important that the young men don't put
[1:01:39] themselves on pressure to be like
[1:01:42] somebody else and Pastor you travel a
[1:01:44] lot you travel a lot say that you've
[1:01:47] traveled to the US or you've going to
[1:01:49] Germany or whichever country and then
[1:01:52] Pastor katumba you know he at home and
[1:01:54] is local pastor and pastoring the people
[1:01:56] are you not afraid that when you come
[1:01:58] back he's taking the ministry and you
[1:02:01] know and you know people are now looking
[1:02:02] up to him and no longer to you no sir no
[1:02:05] sir um I don't
[1:02:09] see things like that
[1:02:12] MH um I think a
[1:02:16] man who gets at the center MH of an
[1:02:21] opportunity mhm and destroy
[1:02:25] is the work that he has been honored to
[1:02:29] share in MH has a problem amen yeah and
[1:02:35] uh I'm here to tell you m every Church
[1:02:40] which breaks off
[1:02:44] unceremoniously they never settle MH
[1:02:47] they never settle mhm yeah I think it's
[1:02:52] very
[1:02:53] important uh for
[1:02:55] ministers to really be able to
[1:02:58] understand that when God calls
[1:03:01] you you are not a threat to me exactly
[1:03:05] you are called of God to serve God God
[1:03:08] didn't call you to fight me mhm that's
[1:03:11] not the call God called you to serve his
[1:03:14] children amen so the objective and
[1:03:17] motive of every Ministry must be checked
[1:03:22] amen yeah so I'm not threatened because
[1:03:26] uh brother James katumba is real tested
[1:03:29] character real tested character and uh
[1:03:33] the Lord has so much greatly used him
[1:03:36] amen yeah and uh I think if we could get
[1:03:41] men like that we would not uh be
[1:03:47] overburdened by the work which God has
[1:03:49] given to us mhm you know perfect love
[1:03:52] casts out fear yeah that's right
[1:03:55] you know it casts out fear so sometimes
[1:03:58] the ministers are breaking their backs
[1:04:01] simply because they are lacking in the
[1:04:04] area of perfect love Yeah and uh
[1:04:08] sometimes we fear too much until we
[1:04:12] cause the people that work with us a
[1:04:15] problem yeah you know why are you not
[1:04:17] settled you asked me to work with you
[1:04:20] but you unsettled you know this is
[1:04:23] adoption now yeah uh when we talk about
[1:04:27] adoption we are talking about somebody
[1:04:30] who has grown to the r of his father
[1:04:32] because many times when we teach
[1:04:35] adoption uh people are giving examples
[1:04:39] about a natural father but a natural
[1:04:42] father dies so the spiritual adoption is
[1:04:47] you coming into position of
[1:04:49] responsibility with the heavenly father
[1:04:52] that never dies yeah so you must be able
[1:04:57] you know when you are coming to your
[1:04:59] adoption you must be able to come to a
[1:05:02] level where you are going to be
[1:05:04] permanently trusted that's right yeah
[1:05:06] I'll give you an example of The Prodigal
[1:05:09] Son The Prodigal Son did not know that
[1:05:13] adoption means permanently being under
[1:05:16] the leadership of the headship MH he
[1:05:19] helped his father raise the farm to such
[1:05:22] a great height and then he said I think
[1:05:24] if I took my own it would be greater
[1:05:28] yeah so he says give me what belongs to
[1:05:30] me he was given he went but the moment
[1:05:33] he walked away from the headship then
[1:05:37] that Prosperity anointing left him left
[1:05:40] him completely because adoption is
[1:05:43] permanently staying under the leadership
[1:05:46] of the headship yeah and uh even the
[1:05:49] younger men that are going to become
[1:05:51] ministers today you take that same
[1:05:54] picture that when you really have been
[1:05:56] trusted by a a headship and given a
[1:06:00] responsibility in church wait until the
[1:06:04] Lord moves you from that spot to another
[1:06:06] spot yeah yeah it should not be you know
[1:06:10] you trying to say give me what belongs
[1:06:13] to me you know you go and you squander
[1:06:16] it and then you're like no longer even
[1:06:19] respect you you're no longer my you know
[1:06:21] my pastor I'm a pastor of my own and you
[1:06:22] know they they like quoting
[1:06:24] you know what a prophet say that every
[1:06:26] church is Sovereign so maybe you can
[1:06:28] throw more light on that so if a church
[1:06:30] is Sovereign and I came out from under
[1:06:32] your ministry does it mean that I no
[1:06:33] longer look up to you I no longer
[1:06:35] respect you I just do things my way I
[1:06:37] don't even listen to your councel yeah
[1:06:40] when we said the church uh every local
[1:06:43] church is uh you know
[1:06:47] Sovereign we are not saying that you are
[1:06:50] pulled
[1:06:51] away even from your
[1:06:55] spiritual
[1:06:56] ancestry you know the church where you
[1:06:59] came
[1:07:00] from certainly you have a pastor when
[1:07:02] you go yeah the reason why we get
[1:07:06] problems with some of these young
[1:07:09] ministers is that they have been in
[1:07:12] church but they've not been pastored
[1:07:15] yeah yeah they are part of church for 10
[1:07:19] years but they have never been pastored
[1:07:23] why they were there they were interested
[1:07:26] in hearing what you preach because they
[1:07:29] wanted to
[1:07:30] preach yeah but they never subjected
[1:07:34] themselves to being pastored yeah so
[1:07:37] they woke out with exactly a rebellious
[1:07:41] Spirit saying that now I am independent
[1:07:46] yeah but the independence of a local
[1:07:49] church is actually in the area of
[1:07:52] administration mhm yeah not completely
[1:07:55] saying that now I'm not answerable to
[1:07:59] the rest of the body of Christ no but
[1:08:03] responsible for their own you know
[1:08:06] incomes and plans and uh developments
[1:08:10] and maybe bringing in visitors they
[1:08:13] don't have to ask anybody but when it
[1:08:16] comes to
[1:08:18] responsibility you know we go back to
[1:08:22] you know what brother br Tau you know
[1:08:25] you you you you have a bishop over you
[1:08:28] exactly you know uh like a man comes
[1:08:31] from my church uh brother Branham
[1:08:34] literally say I become his Bishop yeah
[1:08:37] if he ministers to people who come from
[1:08:40] under him he becomes their Bishop
[1:08:42] exactly so it would really be necessary
[1:08:46] that we
[1:08:47] keep
[1:08:49] uh the order mhm the way brother Bram
[1:08:53] gave it to us I think we can live as a
[1:08:56] settled church amen amen I think well I
[1:08:59] couldn't I couldn't agree more and these
[1:09:01] words are really words of wisdom I know
[1:09:04] that uh many young ministers are
[1:09:06] listening to this and even to to this
[1:09:09] many years after this uh and I trusted
[1:09:11] to be and continue to be a blessing and
[1:09:14] still in that part of ministry because
[1:09:16] you see drawing from a man of an
[1:09:19] experience of 44 years plus uh I kind of
[1:09:23] feel inclined more to ask things
[1:09:25] regarding Ministry and
[1:09:28] um what is your and this I ask you but I
[1:09:32] know that it's going to impact the the
[1:09:34] listeners and they themselves will be
[1:09:35] able to um to do an inventory on their
[1:09:39] own life and
[1:09:40] Ministry uh what was your motivation in
[1:09:44] going out to preach and start a
[1:09:47] Ministry yeah uh you see one thing is I
[1:09:53] believed in winning souls for
[1:09:56] Christ and uh that's what solar I
[1:10:00] was one who would go out and be an
[1:10:05] evangelist and bring souls in and uh
[1:10:09] even when I
[1:10:10] got uh to believe the message that's the
[1:10:14] way I was looking at myself that I would
[1:10:18] go out here start a group and go and go
[1:10:21] here start a group and run away M that's
[1:10:24] what I really thought I wanted so I had
[1:10:28] passion for Souls that was Point number
[1:10:32] one so when I started the work down in
[1:10:36] ginger I knew I was going to leave and
[1:10:40] go but um um
[1:10:46] 1986 uh is when I started pastoring out
[1:10:50] in ginger I had a very little group of
[1:10:54] people and I thought like um I think
[1:10:57] after I've established them I should be
[1:11:02] you know going on and brother Harold
[1:11:05] came into my life at that time in
[1:11:09] 1986 and he says brother stevenh that's
[1:11:12] a
[1:11:14] mistake brother Bram was a prophet but
[1:11:17] he was to do the work of an evangelist
[1:11:21] he pastored the church MH they say it
[1:11:24] would be very profitable for you if you
[1:11:29] stayed in a place become a pastor take
[1:11:33] care of a people be able to raise an
[1:11:36] example that you are going to car around
[1:11:39] with you you know that you've got a
[1:11:42] church back home and he says that will
[1:11:46] open doors for you that will help you in
[1:11:50] your mission work you know because there
[1:11:53] is a problem brother BS we need to be
[1:11:57] open about it that uh um there's very
[1:12:02] little about
[1:12:05] evangelism in the message churches MH
[1:12:08] and uh that's very very dangerous yeah
[1:12:12] that is true um to them
[1:12:16] evangelism is preaching to our own
[1:12:20] children so that they can maybe believe
[1:12:24] or something like that the passion for
[1:12:28] Souls MH has totally been lost that was
[1:12:33] my driving force right when I was still
[1:12:36] in
[1:12:37] organization I wanted to see men saved
[1:12:40] and when I came into the ministry that's
[1:12:43] what I thought was my main goal to get
[1:12:47] men to the Lord Jesus Christ and then
[1:12:51] afterwards I kind of learned to settle
[1:12:55] and be able to nurture the men that the
[1:12:59] Lord had put into my hands so for the
[1:13:02] last
[1:13:04] 30 many years how many years now since
[1:13:09] 1986 you know I've been pastoring people
[1:13:13] and uh I've been doing Mission work and
[1:13:17] um you know different churches have been
[1:13:20] opened up and I'm really thankful that
[1:13:24] right now I begin to see the original
[1:13:27] driving force which were seeing so saved
[1:13:30] here amen well you see uh there some
[1:13:33] that say talking of predestination that
[1:13:36] God knows those who are he and you know
[1:13:38] and so we don't need to we don't need to
[1:13:40] evangelize they will come anyhow they
[1:13:42] will come anyhow what what do you say
[1:13:45] about that I say everything brother B
[1:13:48] Because with that kind of thinking then
[1:13:51] the Lord would have just come and stood
[1:13:54] in Jerusalem as a magnet and all the
[1:13:57] elect would come to
[1:14:00] him those who are predestinated life
[1:14:03] yeah would come to him you see that's uh
[1:14:07] it's very lame yeah yeah it's very lame
[1:14:10] it doesn't stand yeah even those who say
[1:14:14] so they get people in somehow they will
[1:14:18] share a book they will share a testimony
[1:14:21] they pray for somebody and somebody gets
[1:14:24] healed you see it's just uh avoiding the
[1:14:28] responsibility yeah but even those who
[1:14:31] say so the people they have they have
[1:14:34] had to bring them somehow exactly yeah
[1:14:37] you know the prophet preached someone
[1:14:38] convinced then concerned yeah I believe
[1:14:41] we should be concerned about this
[1:14:42] message and now uh how many churches
[1:14:46] would you I don't know if you've been
[1:14:48] taking inventory but like how many have
[1:14:49] started under your ministry for the past
[1:14:51] 40 years uh quite a number I know
[1:14:54] there's been quite an influx coming in
[1:14:56] recently yeah uh like how many cuz I've
[1:14:59] been hearing by thousands and maybe some
[1:15:01] have been hearing also and they would
[1:15:03] like to hear firstand from you today
[1:15:05] yeah um about what is happening now yeah
[1:15:10] the Lord has given us Grace brother
[1:15:12] BS and um it all started with our radio
[1:15:19] program M
[1:15:22] uh people listen to us M People call
[1:15:27] in and uh after some
[1:15:31] time there was a man who was heading a
[1:15:35] Baptist group of people and he had so
[1:15:39] many churches under
[1:15:42] him um he came to us and invited us and
[1:15:48] he said he wanted us to go and uh uh
[1:15:52] help help him
[1:15:54] speak uh you know in several meetings
[1:15:58] that he was going to organize around and
[1:16:01] little did we know that this gentleman
[1:16:05] had an
[1:16:06] agenda yeah because he wanted us to kind
[1:16:10] of cement his group together so we went
[1:16:15] in and uh I started taking
[1:16:20] seriously you know subjects on the name
[1:16:24] Jesus and uh what is
[1:16:28] redemption uh what's the new birth
[1:16:31] what's the blood you know all those kind
[1:16:34] of catch uh you know areas of the
[1:16:38] message and these people had never at
[1:16:42] all had this so we started organizing
[1:16:46] big meetings out of them we put in some
[1:16:49] bit of to get them together and uh after
[1:16:54] some time this gentleman felt like he's
[1:16:58] losing his
[1:16:59] people when he tried to back a track
[1:17:03] more than three quarters of all his
[1:17:05] people in quite a number of districts
[1:17:08] wouldn't be able to go back to him we
[1:17:11] started doing massive
[1:17:14] baptisms from those people and then
[1:17:19] eventually what is happening is that
[1:17:21] this man here
[1:17:24] believes he reads the books and then he
[1:17:27] says I want to share this with my
[1:17:30] neighbor here another Pentecostal or
[1:17:34] whatever Baptist you know then the next
[1:17:38] thing is he's calling you there's a man
[1:17:41] here who has believed he's pastoring a
[1:17:44] group of about 50 people or 70 people
[1:17:48] can you come and help him grow and then
[1:17:51] you know you end up then this one gets
[1:17:54] to that one is a multiplier effect a
[1:17:58] very big one and I can tell you that we
[1:18:02] get very massive meetings when we come
[1:18:06] together amen now there is
[1:18:12] a a thas side of
[1:18:15] it is it true mhm we always say come and
[1:18:21] see
[1:18:23] you see that's the only thing we say
[1:18:26] come and see yeah so we got War lots of
[1:18:30] people that have believed do we have
[1:18:33] some numbers in thousands praise the
[1:18:36] Lord yeah because this is me now the
[1:18:40] people that I'm working with if I can
[1:18:43] count we are working with people in
[1:18:46] about 20 districts yeah and this is me
[1:18:50] now and the rest of the brothers that
[1:18:53] are working around in this together with
[1:18:56] me yeah and uh you know you know the
[1:19:00] books you print they are swallowed by
[1:19:03] those people the Bibles you give us they
[1:19:06] are swallowed by those people and those
[1:19:10] people are continuing going on
[1:19:12] discipling others yeah so sometimes
[1:19:18] um some people may doubt a little bit we
[1:19:23] actually print over seven seven about
[1:19:25] 7,000 books a month yeah yeah but people
[1:19:29] can doubt a little bit and then the
[1:19:31] question is how can they believe unless
[1:19:35] they have seen they have
[1:19:37] sent somebody to them and they don't
[1:19:41] want to be the ones who are sent yeah so
[1:19:45] I say that many times um there is a
[1:19:50] concept that people have that
[1:19:52] Pentecostal don't
[1:19:53] believe they don't believe simply
[1:19:57] because what they give them is not the
[1:20:01] word yeah but if you take the word
[1:20:05] there's no reason why those people not
[1:20:08] believe you know we we we we take Christ
[1:20:11] at a higher order at a higher level you
[1:20:15] know most of these people who go out
[1:20:18] there
[1:20:20] uh they are not preaching Christ
[1:20:23] but if you enter into that place and you
[1:20:26] start preaching Christ at a higher level
[1:20:30] it's going to challenge those people
[1:20:32] exactly and they are going to say where
[1:20:34] do you get this from then that's when I
[1:20:36] start saying God has sent a prophet to
[1:20:40] this age amen amen you know but most of
[1:20:43] these people they go out and say God has
[1:20:46] sent to us a prophet I think that's the
[1:20:49] wrong way yeah the approach is wrong
[1:20:51] yeah the approach is wrong even brother
[1:20:53] Bram never sent us to preach him yeah
[1:20:55] that's true you see what I mean you take
[1:20:58] Christ and then out of that we give them
[1:21:02] the books yeah and I tell you it lights
[1:21:06] up their hearts amen yeah amen amen so
[1:21:10] going back to the message of the hour
[1:21:11] and I'll just take maybe about two three
[1:21:13] questions and I'll call it a quit but uh
[1:21:16] before then I'll ask those of you who
[1:21:18] are following us online if you have any
[1:21:21] questions please we'll ask you uh in the
[1:21:24] next few moments to post it we will take
[1:21:26] some time to to give those questions to
[1:21:29] the pastor so you can be able to answer
[1:21:31] them he's talked about many things
[1:21:33] regarding a Ministry regarding marriage
[1:21:36] and many other things that I'm sure you
[1:21:38] would want to ask about or if there's
[1:21:40] something else that you have not asked
[1:21:43] and you want to ask it please feel free
[1:21:45] to do that now going back to the message
[1:21:47] of the hour uh and this is just a
[1:21:49] straight up question yes what to you
[1:21:52] makes makes it the truth what to me
[1:21:55] makes it the truth yes the message of
[1:21:58] the hour you see
[1:22:01] one the message of the hour in
[1:22:05] itself it tells me where I am standing
[1:22:08] in
[1:22:10] time and you know when you look around
[1:22:14] when Christ wanted to prove a point he
[1:22:18] would point back and he would say this
[1:22:21] day this
[1:22:23] is fulfilled it's not a philosophy
[1:22:27] that's right and not just a theology but
[1:22:30] it's
[1:22:32] identifying God in season exactly you
[1:22:36] see what I mean yeah yeah when Christ
[1:22:39] came you know the
[1:22:41] circumstances that were around his birth
[1:22:44] for example you know it was very
[1:22:48] difficult for the people to believe he
[1:22:49] was a virgin born yeah but for those who
[1:22:52] believe believed you know they had look
[1:22:55] back at what that Christ was supposed to
[1:22:58] be so to me when I go back into uh the
[1:23:05] scriptures and I start looking at this
[1:23:08] season and what is happening and I can
[1:23:11] be able to say this day this scripture
[1:23:14] is fulfilled I can see that uh uh you
[1:23:18] know truth has been restored that had
[1:23:21] been lost in the apostolic age uh
[1:23:25] godhead baptism we have been restored to
[1:23:29] the knowledge of the original seed and
[1:23:31] all these kind of things and we go back
[1:23:34] into Acts chapter 3 from Verse 18 where
[1:23:39] it says that all this has been to has to
[1:23:41] be restored then so you look at the
[1:23:45] lining up of all the things that have
[1:23:49] been kept secret from before the
[1:23:51] foundation of the World being made
[1:23:54] brightly lit by the ministry of the
[1:23:58] Prophet then you really say it cannot be
[1:24:02] anything other than truth because he
[1:24:06] completely blends with the Bible amen
[1:24:09] yeah brother Branham never told things
[1:24:13] that he could not confirm by the Bible
[1:24:17] that's right so when I look at prophecy
[1:24:20] concerning the end of time and look at
[1:24:23] what brother Bram told and was able to
[1:24:26] be Vindicated at the same time then it
[1:24:29] makes this message the truth amen amen
[1:24:33] praise the Lord I think even this is
[1:24:35] what made Jesus Christ be the Messiah
[1:24:38] because when he came he fulfilled what
[1:24:40] was written of him yeah and even John
[1:24:42] himself when they asked they they they
[1:24:45] wanted to know who he was what he did he
[1:24:47] did he introduced the Messiah this is
[1:24:49] what Elijah was supposed to do so
[1:24:51] brother B in our generation has done
[1:24:53] what he was supposed to do he has
[1:24:55] fulfilled the scripture which was
[1:24:56] written of him yeah and more so not only
[1:25:00] theologically fulfilled but he was
[1:25:03] Vindicated yeah yeah he was Vindicated
[1:25:05] not theologically only yeah God is
[1:25:07] saying this is Truth by signs behind and
[1:25:10] wonders it's not signs like miracles of
[1:25:12] walking and so on but you know the pill
[1:25:15] of fire and many different ways God
[1:25:18] Vindicated his prophet in this season
[1:25:20] amen so it literally
[1:25:23] uh gives us a solid ground to stand on
[1:25:27] amen amen we we we we have um many that
[1:25:32] are starting Ministry and many that are
[1:25:34] already in the ministry for for a while
[1:25:35] but this question I want to ask you yes
[1:25:38] please I cannot ask this question to
[1:25:40] somebody like me who has been the
[1:25:41] message for maybe 10 years 17 uh I've
[1:25:44] preached personally the message 18 um 17
[1:25:47] years this year um
[1:25:51] but you you have been in the message
[1:25:54] longer and I've preached this longer and
[1:25:57] so I would want to ask you that many
[1:25:58] have started out in the ministry for so
[1:26:00] long and then they give up they reach a
[1:26:03] moment and then they give up and now you
[1:26:06] being in the ministry for over 40 years
[1:26:08] and have the question is have you ever
[1:26:11] felt like quitting the pulpit and if
[1:26:14] so what is the staying power because
[1:26:16] you've
[1:26:18] stayed yeah uh any man
[1:26:23] who is in the ministry
[1:26:25] sincerely will always feel like quitting
[1:26:29] that's to be
[1:26:30] honest but when you look at the purpose
[1:26:33] of your call you ask God give me staying
[1:26:38] power amen the main main main main
[1:26:43] problem is
[1:26:45] ourselves yeah many
[1:26:50] times you see
[1:26:54] you are a very lucky
[1:26:56] person maybe you've never been dropped
[1:26:59] into the Hall of
[1:27:02] critics that's where you feel like you
[1:27:05] can
[1:27:06] quit yeah you'll always feel like I
[1:27:10] think I quit but then you come to a
[1:27:13] point and say oh
[1:27:15] no something I've done all my life you
[1:27:19] see I keep asking myself if
[1:27:22] I
[1:27:25] quit
[1:27:27] how you know what can I do because this
[1:27:31] is all I know to do I've never done
[1:27:33] anything else yeah you know it's your
[1:27:36] life yeah when you go to uh standing in
[1:27:39] the Gap yes brother Bram wanted to
[1:27:44] quit when you go to Bru the serent
[1:27:48] brother Branham wanted to quit and you
[1:27:51] see with brother Branham you look at
[1:27:54] this other side it's the
[1:27:56] criticism and then he says I cannot go
[1:27:59] he called them you know Ricky and Ricks
[1:28:03] and God says no I've got my people there
[1:28:06] and then on the bruised serpent it's
[1:28:08] people making him Christ yeah so on two
[1:28:13] extremes brother Branham wanted to quit
[1:28:16] yeah but most
[1:28:18] times a naturally you know Pastor like
[1:28:21] me
[1:28:23] you feel like you want to quit because
[1:28:26] of standing in the Gap brother
[1:28:31] BS the problem of every member of your
[1:28:34] church will be your problem MH that's
[1:28:37] true you see what I mean every failure
[1:28:41] of the member of your
[1:28:43] church will be your
[1:28:46] failure you know the people I was saying
[1:28:52] I was telling people that you know the
[1:28:55] last thing that you should ever do is to
[1:28:58] quit coming to
[1:29:00] church I said look at a man like a
[1:29:06] soul he came to church and whenever he
[1:29:10] came to
[1:29:11] church the ministry of the man he
[1:29:15] hated is what was healing his
[1:29:18] depression he didn't like David you know
[1:29:22] but David would strum that jitar and the
[1:29:26] Demons of
[1:29:27] hate
[1:29:29] indifference and all would you know
[1:29:33] leave
[1:29:34] Soul you understand what I mean so many
[1:29:39] times
[1:29:41] um you'll be up there MH and you'll know
[1:29:46] you are speaking to
[1:29:48] people and you will know because this is
[1:29:51] being open
[1:29:52] to you brothers that you are speaking to
[1:29:56] people and as you look you are aware of
[1:30:00] some people who don't believe you but
[1:30:03] they never leave the
[1:30:07] church yeah you understand what I me
[1:30:10] that yeah that's they never leave the
[1:30:12] church you know it tests your brotherly
[1:30:15] kindness yeah that's true so that you
[1:30:18] stand there with perfect love yes you
[1:30:21] understand understand what I mean so
[1:30:23] that you are not sidetracked MH and you
[1:30:28] make a sermon best on one man that's the
[1:30:32] most difficult thing in the
[1:30:35] ministry when you are out there and you
[1:30:39] know I'm speaking here but so and so and
[1:30:42] so and so and so and so don't believe
[1:30:45] me I used to go and preach
[1:30:48] somewhere um hundreds of miles from from
[1:30:52] here and uh get big big big meetings you
[1:30:57] know and um there was a brother in the
[1:31:02] area he would be sitting in the
[1:31:05] back when you are preaching this he says
[1:31:08] brother brandham said this brother Bram
[1:31:10] said this you know and uh you know it
[1:31:14] takes patience I don't care what he was
[1:31:17] saying I to really keep taking the
[1:31:20] people on those are the things that you
[1:31:23] really feel like you may quit yeah yeah
[1:31:28] you are going to a
[1:31:31] place and the best thing that goes ahead
[1:31:34] of
[1:31:36] you is the negative reports yeah those
[1:31:41] make you feel you want to quit like you
[1:31:43] want to
[1:31:45] quit is you know preaching is a call M
[1:31:51] if it was not a call one would
[1:31:54] quit but it's a call and you really feel
[1:31:58] like it hangs over on your
[1:32:01] heart so there are many many reasons why
[1:32:06] you really feel like why am I into the
[1:32:11] ring you know where you feel like you
[1:32:14] need to punch over the devil and then
[1:32:17] you get you know some other blows from
[1:32:19] the back those make you like you want to
[1:32:24] quit MH
[1:32:26] but
[1:32:28] impossible amen we have to carry this
[1:32:30] fight on up to the enden amen amen Paul
[1:32:34] said the why unto me if I preach not the
[1:32:36] gospel yeah and I've often spoken to
[1:32:39] younger ministers those that have
[1:32:41] nurtured um the few that have nurtured
[1:32:43] in the ministry told them that do not do
[1:32:47] not preach situation but preach
[1:32:52] inspiration because you find that many
[1:32:54] times ministers young ministers make
[1:32:57] that
[1:32:57] mistake in that um when you you find you
[1:33:01] get frustrated especially if people
[1:33:03] talked about you or somebody did
[1:33:05] something you did not want them to do
[1:33:08] and they in the church like you said
[1:33:09] they're in the church so that morning
[1:33:11] you'll change your sermon to be able to
[1:33:13] feeled that situation that's not right
[1:33:17] yeah you must know how have you handled
[1:33:19] that yeah um I've always is known one
[1:33:22] thing that God never enthrones a man he
[1:33:28] has not allowed to be tried yeah many
[1:33:32] times people talk about the trials maybe
[1:33:35] like the trials of
[1:33:37] job but the worst trial is the trial of
[1:33:44] the submission of your human Spirit yeah
[1:33:48] yeah that one is the worst battle
[1:33:52] David was in it for a long time when he
[1:33:56] fought the
[1:33:58] bear he to it when he fought the lion he
[1:34:02] toore it when he fought gorth he cut off
[1:34:06] his head but before he could become king
[1:34:11] there was a battle with his brother he
[1:34:14] could not use the same tactics he used
[1:34:18] against the bear the lion and goth very
[1:34:22] revealing he needed brotherly kindness
[1:34:25] my goodness yeah that's the last battle
[1:34:30] that the church will fight before it is
[1:34:33] totally
[1:34:35] enthroned talk a little more about
[1:34:36] brotherly kindness yeah what is
[1:34:39] brotherly kindness brotherly
[1:34:41] kindness is actually now
[1:34:45] listen you take me back to talking about
[1:34:48] state of a perfect man um you know in
[1:34:52] the state of a perfect
[1:34:54] man uh is a very powerful sermon you
[1:34:58] know and um I normally always connect it
[1:35:02] with perfect
[1:35:04] Faith uh it takes perfect
[1:35:07] Faith to start
[1:35:10] building uh you know the Pyramid of your
[1:35:14] life you know brother Branham used the
[1:35:19] pyramid simply because
[1:35:21] he wanted to present to
[1:35:24] us the fact that the church gets horned
[1:35:28] as it grows you see what I mean yes and
[1:35:31] then the Capstone at the top M but when
[1:35:35] he's literally teaching on stat of a
[1:35:38] perfect man that's not the same picture
[1:35:41] he gives us the picture he gives us is
[1:35:45] that God is building a house yeah and
[1:35:49] then he says faith is the foundation
[1:35:52] yeah then when he says he comes to
[1:35:55] Virtue he says that's the First Column
[1:35:58] mhm now when he says that's the First
[1:36:01] Column he's actually saying that's the
[1:36:03] first wall you know so he says you get
[1:36:06] your virtue add it to Faith he says you
[1:36:10] get your knowledge add it to Faith he's
[1:36:13] bringing everything down to Faith which
[1:36:17] means now Faith is a foundation which
[1:36:20] has got six sides to it exactly and then
[1:36:23] C it yeah with brotherly kindness yeah
[1:36:26] because I mean c it with Charity yeah
[1:36:30] because charity is the strength of all
[1:36:33] these virtues here yeah that's right
[1:36:35] charity is the strength that keeps the
[1:36:38] walls strongly held into the foundation
[1:36:43] yeah okay so that means that when you
[1:36:47] are building all these walls m you are
[1:36:51] building them anticipating that charity
[1:36:55] will come and so we go down to First
[1:36:58] Corinth 13 you know where he talking
[1:37:02] about if I have tongues of men and
[1:37:07] angels if I can sacrifice my body to be
[1:37:10] burned without charity meaning that
[1:37:14] charity
[1:37:15] himself which is Christ must come and
[1:37:20] stand behind
[1:37:21] every gift yeah for it to be the gift of
[1:37:25] God Amen so it's exactly the same thing
[1:37:29] that he does in the building of the
[1:37:32] living Tabernacle of the Living God Amen
[1:37:35] that actually brotherly kindness cannot
[1:37:40] work if there is no charity
[1:37:45] M because charity is the strength of all
[1:37:48] these so all these Seven Virtues is The
[1:37:51] Life of Christ manifesting itself in a
[1:37:55] Believer amen like he has given us Faith
[1:37:59] he has to give us virtue because he says
[1:38:02] add when it says add is not talking
[1:38:06] about your Works to go and look for
[1:38:09] knowledge and put it here but add is
[1:38:13] saying that add he gives to you to put
[1:38:17] it there put it there yeah so when you
[1:38:21] talk about brotherly kindness it can
[1:38:23] only be given by God amen amen so God
[1:38:27] himself gives us all these
[1:38:30] virtues and uh you remember David after
[1:38:35] the death of Saul M it was very
[1:38:38] interesting you know David stood and
[1:38:41] says isn't there any of the House of
[1:38:46] Soul that remains so that I can show him
[1:38:50] the kindness of God yeah David as a man
[1:38:54] he knew I've gone through a lot because
[1:38:56] of that house if there is any kindness
[1:39:00] that I can be able to pull out it must
[1:39:03] be the kindness of God the nature of God
[1:39:07] in Me yeah so brotherly kindness is a
[1:39:11] part of the nature of God yeah so it's
[1:39:15] one thing to preach it as a Doctrine and
[1:39:18] it's another to allow that living Stream
[1:39:23] flow out out of you will flow rivers of
[1:39:26] Living Water it has to be a virtue that
[1:39:31] is a life of God himself amen amen amen
[1:39:36] and I believe this is what we need in
[1:39:37] the ministry because without which uh
[1:39:40] we're going to look at ourselves as a
[1:39:42] Lonely Island yeah you know you find
[1:39:44] some people talking about brotherly
[1:39:46] kindness brotherly
[1:39:47] kindness but you see the more they speak
[1:39:51] of the poit is the more they hate M I
[1:39:54] think that's not the way God works you
[1:39:57] know so
[1:39:58] yeah well too much to learn in there U I
[1:40:01] believe our viewers can agree with me
[1:40:03] and please keep your questions coming in
[1:40:05] in the next few moments I'm going to
[1:40:07] read your questions and and all your
[1:40:08] comments or whatever you want to tell
[1:40:10] the pastor because we about to end the
[1:40:12] stream in a few moments now I will have
[1:40:15] one last question on my list here I
[1:40:17] would have had many more but of course
[1:40:19] I'll will let the other viewers well
[1:40:21] given their submissions yeah uh and this
[1:40:24] it appears we have handled it like I
[1:40:26] said you have a way of answering my
[1:40:27] questions before I get to them so that I
[1:40:31] I had another question here which as
[1:40:32] much as you might have answered it in a
[1:40:34] way but this will come direct says how
[1:40:37] how have you handled criticism from from
[1:40:41] other Ministry especially those who did
[1:40:43] not approve of you uh it's very
[1:40:48] simple very very simple
[1:40:51] you don't
[1:40:53] fuel your
[1:40:57] criticism you know uh when you answer
[1:41:00] you are giving more
[1:41:03] firewood to
[1:41:06] fun to fun you know what's going on um
[1:41:11] I've always thought this and God
[1:41:14] forbid that any man who is negative in
[1:41:19] mind is under
[1:41:22] atonment
[1:41:24] yeah and uh when a man brings out vents
[1:41:29] out he's trying to vent
[1:41:32] out you know his own torment so when a
[1:41:37] man is under torment you don't torment
[1:41:41] him you forgive him amen you don't give
[1:41:45] back you know when you start going on
[1:41:48] answering criticism you are going to to
[1:41:51] waste all the people's time all these
[1:41:54] people here they are not concerned about
[1:41:56] it you know you come to to to feed the
[1:41:59] people yeah you know you don't come to
[1:42:02] justify yourself before people you know
[1:42:06] uh people have got a right to say what
[1:42:08] they want to say because that's on the
[1:42:10] inside of them yeah yeah I don't feel
[1:42:14] that I I just keep going ahead I hate
[1:42:17] battles one brother BS I want to live in
[1:42:20] a state of mind that I do not need to
[1:42:24] come and repent and say I'm sorry I did
[1:42:27] this you would rather come to me and say
[1:42:30] I'm sorry but not me coming to say I'm
[1:42:33] sorry I wouldn't want to get into
[1:42:36] situations of running around I'm sorry
[1:42:38] I'm sorry and some people complain
[1:42:41] because I don't fight
[1:42:45] back they would have rather had you
[1:42:48] fight back said this man made feel
[1:42:50] better you you you never hear him you
[1:42:52] know you you will not hear him talk
[1:42:54] about you you know a brother told me so
[1:42:57] I and I I don't know why somebody would
[1:43:00] need you to fight because the call of
[1:43:03] preaching the gospel is not to justify
[1:43:08] myself or to destroy another brother but
[1:43:13] to lift up Christ that's so well some
[1:43:16] ministers they would rather fight the
[1:43:19] people back or the other ministers back
[1:43:21] especially on their pull pit because
[1:43:22] they fear they have fear that if they do
[1:43:25] not the people may run and you know go
[1:43:27] to to their opposit that's okay you see
[1:43:31] if the people leave then they were not
[1:43:34] part of what God ordained for me to take
[1:43:36] before the found I mean to take you know
[1:43:38] home with me yes yeah but um you see
[1:43:43] it's very
[1:43:44] unfortunate uh when
[1:43:47] ministers to begin with um begin to
[1:43:53] publicly fight one another I think
[1:43:57] maturity uh would help us one day I
[1:44:01] trust one day when the squeeze comes yes
[1:44:05] we shall need one another
[1:44:07] amen and uh I have seen this before that
[1:44:12] uh sometimes situations come and those
[1:44:16] situations teach us that we need one
[1:44:18] another we need one another yeah
[1:44:21] um if there people that I've learned
[1:44:22] that from I've learned it from you and
[1:44:24] I've come to a place where I realize I'm
[1:44:27] not a Lonely Island I'm just a little PE
[1:44:29] on the beach and the other day brother B
[1:44:33] before you continue the brother came to
[1:44:36] me and says oh this and that you been F
[1:44:39] I said why would you
[1:44:41] fight then he says oh these people say
[1:44:44] things on you I say keep quiet he looked
[1:44:47] at me and he said that requires a very
[1:44:53] big
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:56] gift but uh we we have to we have to
[1:45:00] learn uh David changed his tactics yeah
[1:45:04] brother Bram says David had the ability
[1:45:07] to tear Soul's church if he wanted to
[1:45:10] yeah yeah he would even cut a piece of
[1:45:13] His Garment and just doing that it
[1:45:15] haunted him yeah I would say this will
[1:45:20] you permit me please please a little bit
[1:45:23] strong though please go ahead that I do
[1:45:26] not really see and understand
[1:45:29] why a man would directly shoot his
[1:45:33] brother MH to kill him and
[1:45:37] rejoice look at
[1:45:40] Judas Judas knew Christ is very powerful
[1:45:45] I'm going to take that money those
[1:45:47] people will not be able to take
[1:45:49] him when he discovered they had taken
[1:45:52] him he threw away the
[1:45:55] money and went and hanged himself H
[1:46:00] today you may be
[1:46:02] surprised that a brother can stab
[1:46:05] another in the back kill his influence
[1:46:09] and
[1:46:09] celebrate my goodness Judas wouldn't do
[1:46:12] that even Judas wouldn't do that so my
[1:46:16] goodness my
[1:46:19] goodness
[1:46:21] I think we should learn to really be to
[1:46:25] be you know humble and uh you know
[1:46:32] accommodate to one another yeah yeah not
[1:46:35] everybody is going to see things the way
[1:46:36] you see them yeah and the realization
[1:46:40] that that is so is a revelation on its
[1:46:43] own because I think ministers have a way
[1:46:46] of liking those that see things the way
[1:46:48] they see them and agree with them when
[1:46:50] everything yeah and I think there's
[1:46:52] something that you say that I've been
[1:46:54] thinking about for a while that uhu
[1:46:57] being in the church there can be a
[1:46:59] person or people that you know do not
[1:47:02] actually accept everything you're saying
[1:47:03] but they will not leave they won't leave
[1:47:06] and you as a pastor you would want to
[1:47:08] have everybody agreeing with you 100%
[1:47:11] that one will not work but it will never
[1:47:13] happen it will never happen yeah it will
[1:47:16] never and yet you have to feed everybody
[1:47:18] oh yeah including them including them
[1:47:20] yeah you know David had to feed so yeah
[1:47:24] yeah you have to feed them you know and
[1:47:28] uh
[1:47:29] uh
[1:47:31] generally listen
[1:47:35] Brothers
[1:47:37] Jesus during his
[1:47:40] last days of service here on
[1:47:44] Earth he says
[1:47:47] Peter lovest thou me
[1:47:52] and he says yes I
[1:47:54] do feed my Lambs you love me yes I do
[1:47:58] feed my Lambs you love me feed my
[1:48:01] sheep okay now I want you to see
[1:48:07] here that there is a difference between
[1:48:11] lamps and
[1:48:14] sheep every sheep has ever been a lamp
[1:48:19] but not every lamp has ever been
[1:48:24] sheep
[1:48:25] now
[1:48:27] lamps were
[1:48:29] used in religious
[1:48:32] ceremonies in the Old
[1:48:35] Testament it was always a lamp a lamp a
[1:48:39] lamp when Christ
[1:48:42] came he never became a
[1:48:45] sheep he remained a lamp a lamp a lamp
[1:48:51] but
[1:48:52] sheep becomes independent
[1:48:56] minded and Isaiah says all we like sheep
[1:49:02] have gone astray not all we like a lamp
[1:49:07] but all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:49:12] in church you will have sheep and you'll
[1:49:16] have to feed them amen independent
[1:49:18] minded people m M can I tell you
[1:49:21] something here sure sheep is a mob
[1:49:25] animal that if one sheep goes astray all
[1:49:29] of them will want to go astray I tell
[1:49:32] you brother B one sheep here can stray
[1:49:36] or will stray and you are going to be
[1:49:40] surprised how many sheep can fight back
[1:49:44] on you not because they are not children
[1:49:48] of God but they they've developed an
[1:49:51] independent mind mhm and by Nature sheep
[1:49:56] are M animals in
[1:49:59] tury there was a ship that went up on a
[1:50:04] cliff and
[1:50:06] jumped and then the next ship jumped and
[1:50:10] the man lost
[1:50:12] 1,500 Sheep by jumping themselves to
[1:50:16] death oh my God so you are a pastor oh
[1:50:20] feed my
[1:50:22] lamp feed my sheep so that we can
[1:50:26] maintain them trying to display the
[1:50:29] character of a lamb yeah yeah there are
[1:50:31] people that are going to come they just
[1:50:34] as smart as you are they think like you
[1:50:37] sometimes better you know you said this
[1:50:39] they say well if it was me and they'll
[1:50:42] be there but even those the shepherd
[1:50:46] Peter was told feed them amen amen
[1:50:51] a lot of wisdom a lot of encouragement a
[1:50:54] lot of instruction we really appreciate
[1:50:56] this um please we want to hear from you
[1:50:58] want to see your comments your
[1:51:00] testimonies and I have one from Sister
[1:51:03] Mari this is the pastor's wife from
[1:51:05] Ethiopia she's been following and she
[1:51:07] says enjoying so much bench this morning
[1:51:09] Elder Pastor IAL you you walk and
[1:51:11] surrender to uh to the Lord your work
[1:51:14] and surrender to the Lord is so amazing
[1:51:16] from the
[1:51:17] beginning um the min is submission to
[1:51:21] the leadership of the Holy Spirit I
[1:51:23] think you mentioned that so she was
[1:51:24] saying she was so um impacted by that by
[1:51:27] that Court submitting to the leadership
[1:51:29] of the holy spirit that it takes you to
[1:51:32] uh the ordained field that you are
[1:51:34] appointed to be in the Harvest amen very
[1:51:37] powerful Pastor IAL and uh then somebody
[1:51:40] else here says uh this is kma Moses says
[1:51:43] thank you Pastor pastors we are so
[1:51:45] blessed by the elders exaltation very
[1:51:47] deep words of wisdom and and uh this uh
[1:51:52] this is another one from a brother he's
[1:51:54] a pastor as well B Moses he says surely
[1:51:57] thanks Pastor T for bringing Elder
[1:51:59] Steven IAL for I'm really blessed by the
[1:52:02] way he brings out the things God bless
[1:52:04] you so much and this is a minister I
[1:52:07] would say within my rooms cuz he's also
[1:52:09] a younger a younger Minister and so you
[1:52:11] can see there's many other younger
[1:52:12] pastors and ministers that have been
[1:52:14] following and so there is another one
[1:52:17] called Joshua a brother called Joshua he
[1:52:19] has a question he says God bless you
[1:52:21] help on this there are a lot of groups
[1:52:23] in the same message like seven Thunders
[1:52:27] morning cry it ISC what do you make
[1:52:31] about that who is then the
[1:52:35] one maybe I'll let you answer that and
[1:52:38] then I'll give other comments yes
[1:52:41] sir
[1:52:43] now the
[1:52:45] Bible has 66 books m
[1:52:50] brother Isaac which camera should he
[1:52:52] look at cuz he's answering brother
[1:52:53] Joshua right you can look over the other
[1:52:56] camera yeah yes uh the
[1:52:58] Bible has 66
[1:53:02] books but I can use
[1:53:06] Genesis to preach the coming of Christ
[1:53:11] his death and
[1:53:13] Resurrection without going into even the
[1:53:17] very acts of it in the New Testament
[1:53:20] you see what I mean so you
[1:53:24] know if a man decides to
[1:53:29] stay in
[1:53:32] Genesis and he sees Christ and presents
[1:53:36] Christ in Genesis that's
[1:53:39] okay this message here is different
[1:53:44] approaches preaching the same Christ the
[1:53:48] seven Thunders if they can be able to
[1:53:51] present that
[1:53:53] Christ then they don't have a problem if
[1:53:57] the morning cry can be able to present
[1:54:01] that Christ by that morning cry then
[1:54:05] that's okay but if a man stands in the
[1:54:09] Book of Genesis and he says the Book of
[1:54:12] Matthew doesn't take exist that's where
[1:54:15] the problem
[1:54:16] is you see what I mean yeah you know
[1:54:20] that's where I would say the there is a
[1:54:23] problem you know so I think um um or if
[1:54:28] you stand in the book uh of uh Genesis
[1:54:34] and you criticize The Book of Mark every
[1:54:37] time you stand up there's a problem yeah
[1:54:40] so you know I wouldn't uh be able to say
[1:54:45] much because uh sometimes I do not know
[1:54:49] the approach of the morning cry yeah you
[1:54:51] know I don't know the approach of those
[1:54:54] other people but my question would be
[1:54:57] are they preaching that Christ yeah can
[1:55:01] they bring forth that Christ alive and
[1:55:05] life transforming that's the most
[1:55:08] important thing amen it doesn't matter
[1:55:11] what approach you have but if it's being
[1:55:14] able to bring out Christ directly to the
[1:55:17] people and Christ having the
[1:55:20] in his body let them go on brother yeah
[1:55:23] so I think
[1:55:25] that's that's what I have for that
[1:55:28] question yeah amen well uh there is uh
[1:55:32] one
[1:55:35] brother brother Joshua brother Joshua
[1:55:38] this is another brother Joshua John AA
[1:55:41] he says great wisdom here thank you
[1:55:43] Pastor tala for inviting our Elder
[1:55:45] Pastor I I'm really being
[1:55:48] blessed amen man so then there is uh
[1:55:52] okay brother brother brother Moses I
[1:55:54] think is the one you are answering oh no
[1:55:56] no this is somebody else he says uh he's
[1:55:59] commenting on what he just said he says
[1:56:01] even Judas couldn't sell Christ and
[1:56:04] rejoice much respect sir so deep and
[1:56:07] deeper may God engrave it uh with an
[1:56:10] iron pain on our
[1:56:11] hearts amen and so uh this brother calb
[1:56:16] he says God bless you Pastor I'm really
[1:56:17] very humbled by the calm way he brings
[1:56:20] out points well that's what an elder is
[1:56:22] for he says God richly bless you Pastor
[1:56:25] I and uh so the there's um there's this
[1:56:30] thing question that I've been debating
[1:56:32] whether I should ask or not decided to
[1:56:34] leave it but I will ask it it's not
[1:56:36] doctrinal though it's personal what is
[1:56:39] your
[1:56:40] biggest
[1:56:42] regret in life and Ministry my
[1:56:46] biggest regret in life and
[1:56:51] Ministry is when I dropped my vision and
[1:56:55] tried to hang on another man's
[1:56:58] understanding MH that one was so big it
[1:57:01] shook my Ministry M yeah um you know
[1:57:06] sometimes let me say this and it help
[1:57:10] people when we get ministers coming
[1:57:14] through they help us yes and uh because
[1:57:20] the minister who is coming through
[1:57:23] should not sound like our pastor mhm
[1:57:27] he's totally different and that's why
[1:57:29] the pastor brings him because he sees
[1:57:33] he's going to compliment yeah the other
[1:57:35] areas maybe that he doesn't uh
[1:57:39] effectively work in so when you bring a
[1:57:43] man he's going to do uh a lot of uh uh
[1:57:50] effect positively on your people
[1:57:53] exactly and sometimes like maybe in the
[1:57:56] United States migration is very simple
[1:58:00] yeah the people just I'm moving to this
[1:58:03] state I'm moving to this state and when
[1:58:05] we are talking about States we are
[1:58:08] talking about a man moving from here and
[1:58:11] going to South Africa or migrating to
[1:58:13] Ghana you see what I mean and they
[1:58:16] follow that
[1:58:18] Minister and uh sometimes you find out
[1:58:23] that when you go out to that man and he
[1:58:27] continues preaching the way he preached
[1:58:30] it is good yeah but you'll find out that
[1:58:33] you are losing again another part where
[1:58:36] you came from so you discover you made
[1:58:39] the mistake transferring churches what
[1:58:44] was so good that day is not everything
[1:58:48] that you have need of
[1:58:49] mhm okay so
[1:58:53] um I came across tapes
[1:58:57] M and
[1:58:59] uh I went
[1:59:02] into for a spell of about two years MH
[1:59:07] into the seventh Thunder movement
[1:59:10] M but one thing is I thank God because I
[1:59:16] was a student of the word m
[1:59:20] uh when I had
[1:59:23] questions I had the ability of going
[1:59:26] back into the word and really get to see
[1:59:31] am I
[1:59:32] standing on the right ground I'm sorry
[1:59:35] to bring this up because you really
[1:59:38] asked me yeah I found
[1:59:41] out that I had errored in practice M and
[1:59:47] I said God have mercy mhm pulling back
[1:59:52] MH required a lot of humility mhm to say
[1:59:57] I was
[1:59:59] wrong and it caused a lot of
[2:00:02] friction because looks like you are
[2:00:05] opening up a
[2:00:07] Battlefront against a man whom you had
[2:00:10] decided to walk with that's the hardest
[2:00:14] thing I ever
[2:00:17] heard you know um to tell the
[2:00:22] people that associated with my Ministry
[2:00:25] M that I was
[2:00:28] wrong to accept the bashing that went
[2:00:31] with
[2:00:32] it yeah yeah and then the humility that
[2:00:37] I
[2:00:38] needed so that I can be able to restore
[2:00:42] the fellowship that I had
[2:00:44] lost from that day I said God when he
[2:00:48] call a man MH he tells him how to go
[2:00:52] amen and I always said I'll be obedient
[2:00:56] to the leadership of the holy spirit
[2:00:59] amen as he uses me amen as an individual
[2:01:03] amen from that day I don't do Group
[2:01:06] movement amen God gave me Grace I can
[2:01:11] only stand with what I see personally
[2:01:14] yes as the word amen well that goes out
[2:01:19] a lot to uh the young
[2:01:21] ministers uh because you see the Bible
[2:01:23] says that these things were written for
[2:01:24] our amples so if one and we appreciate
[2:01:29] you Pastor for your humility even to
[2:01:30] share that with us um because it is for
[2:01:33] ample yeah and we do appreciate it
[2:01:36] sincerely so um and this one I was
[2:01:40] supposed to ask it much earlier but
[2:01:42] somehow I also left it out and I'll
[2:01:44] finish with that um who was your Mentor
[2:01:47] in the ministry mainly
[2:01:51] who was my mentor in the ministry
[2:01:55] mainly yeah I will tell you the truth
[2:01:58] that brother Charles oio had a very
[2:02:01] great impact on my life he's a very
[2:02:04] humble man M he was my daily example we
[2:02:09] walked together and we did a lot of
[2:02:12] things together for many years and God
[2:02:16] forbid that ego is out there renewing
[2:02:20] his youth he's going through a very
[2:02:25] difficult
[2:02:26] situation Beyond this
[2:02:28] country brother Harold
[2:02:31] hilderbrand had a very great impact on
[2:02:34] my life amen we discussed a lot of
[2:02:39] international issues that affect this
[2:02:43] message and my advice to the young
[2:02:47] people
[2:02:52] always commit yourself to
[2:02:55] men that have got a track record amen of
[2:03:00] humility in
[2:03:02] service yeah that's very deep that's
[2:03:06] very deep and um one last one here from
[2:03:11] somebody I think if you have any more
[2:03:13] questions uh you've not sent them on
[2:03:15] time and I'm going to bring it to a
[2:03:16] close so I will take this one because
[2:03:19] because someone just sent it in Michael
[2:03:21] Scana you did not tell us which country
[2:03:23] you're coming from though he says why in
[2:03:25] the message some say Thunders
[2:03:29] and Seven Seals are
[2:03:32] revealed and others say that it is not
[2:03:36] yet revealed how can you help
[2:03:39] us yeah now you
[2:03:43] see when you go to Revelation
[2:03:47] 10:7 and it's the scripture that I'm
[2:03:50] going to read in this interview M if you
[2:03:53] allow me to do that yeah it is well I
[2:03:56] think brother Isa can also flash it on
[2:03:57] the on the screen Revelation
[2:04:01] 10:7 it's very very very interesting
[2:04:04] here he says but in the
[2:04:09] days of the voice of the seventh
[2:04:14] angel when it shall begin to sound the
[2:04:19] mystery of God which is Christ should be
[2:04:24] finished as he has declared his servants
[2:04:27] the
[2:04:28] prophets so you know all the
[2:04:34] mystery that had been hid from before
[2:04:37] the foundation of the
[2:04:39] world should be
[2:04:42] revealed and the
[2:04:44] word which is
[2:04:47] revealed is Christ Christ MH he says
[2:04:52] Christ is those seals that was revealed
[2:04:57] brother Bram tells us so there is a
[2:05:01] difference between
[2:05:04] revealed and
[2:05:08] manifested they are two different things
[2:05:11] yeah so when we come to the seventh
[2:05:15] seal it's revealed MH but it's a
[2:05:19] continuing
[2:05:22] manifestation some of it is in the past
[2:05:25] tense some of it is in the present tense
[2:05:30] and some of it is still in the future MH
[2:05:34] it's a
[2:05:36] moving Revelation MH so when we say
[2:05:41] revealed we are not saying that all has
[2:05:45] been
[2:05:47] manifested there is more to that seal
[2:05:51] which is still
[2:05:53] unfolding because it keeps going and he
[2:05:57] says it's the end of time yes and as
[2:06:00] long as we are in time it continues to
[2:06:04] unfold yes and it's actually the opening
[2:06:08] of that seventh seal that opens all the
[2:06:13] other
[2:06:14] seals yeah because this seals is like
[2:06:17] roll yeah you know scroll you know and
[2:06:20] then put a seal then scroll you can't
[2:06:23] get into the inner unless you have
[2:06:26] broken the outer the outer one yeah so
[2:06:28] the outer one now brings forth the
[2:06:31] revelation of all these other seals amen
[2:06:35] so uh when we are talking about the
[2:06:38] seventh seal uh people are talking about
[2:06:42] specifics but there are so many things
[2:06:45] in that seal until brother Bram says
[2:06:48] it's like like a Roman candle and the
[2:06:50] Roman Candle that's what we call
[2:06:53] fireworks you know a bigger one comes
[2:06:56] out then smaller ones keep blowing out
[2:06:59] you see what I mean so um it is actually
[2:07:03] that's the world thing right now I
[2:07:06] always tell the people we are not
[2:07:09] dealing with Mysteries we are dealing
[2:07:12] with Revelation Revelation yeah I used
[2:07:15] to preach the mystery of this the
[2:07:17] mystery of this but then it looks like
[2:07:21] I'm just putting a seal on the word
[2:07:23] because all the seals were pulled back
[2:07:26] so we are living in the time of
[2:07:28] Revelation and I totally believe there
[2:07:31] was nothing left behind that could
[2:07:34] justify an eighth messenger amen amen
[2:07:38] well the person that asked that question
[2:07:40] said amen amen amen and I say Amen too
[2:07:43] amen now I have uh a few brothers that
[2:07:46] came up here and I'm going to allow if
[2:07:48] you could just come and stand right here
[2:07:51] and answer your question and then after
[2:07:53] that the pastor will will will
[2:07:56] close thank you so much Pastor TMA thank
[2:07:59] you so much uh Pastor IAL yeah it's a
[2:08:02] pleasure for us young people to be
[2:08:03] sitting in the presence of the elders we
[2:08:06] really get to learn a lot I have just a
[2:08:08] few things to comment on before I ask my
[2:08:10] question yeah I there something that you
[2:08:13] said about you know Judas feeling guilty
[2:08:15] after selling Jesus it really got to me
[2:08:18] to really know that there actually some
[2:08:19] brothers who are West than Judas you
[2:08:22] know please please it's something that
[2:08:25] is you know it's really strong but it's
[2:08:27] the truth it passes the point exactly
[2:08:29] it's it's it's the truth and um I I've
[2:08:33] read you know where the Prophet when you
[2:08:35] were speaking about uh the prophet and
[2:08:38] the Bible the message in the Bible when
[2:08:41] people try to separate this to you know
[2:08:43] personally I think it's people who do
[2:08:45] not understand the hierarchy of how God
[2:08:48] operat
[2:08:49] yeah because the prophet tells us that
[2:08:50] you look at nature you know it's a Bible
[2:08:53] on its own and you know it's like
[2:08:57] um uh it's a tree yeah and we are the
[2:09:02] end products of the tree we are the
[2:09:03] fruits of the tree yeah you know God is
[2:09:06] the life which is in the ground yeah so
[2:09:09] for that life that is in the ground to
[2:09:11] be transferred to the fruit in the tree
[2:09:13] yeah there's got to be the roots yeah
[2:09:15] which is the prophet there's a process
[2:09:17] yeah there's got to be the trunk M which
[2:09:20] is the and the the branches which is the
[2:09:22] fivefold ministry so before the life
[2:09:24] that is in God gets transferred to the
[2:09:26] to the fruits that in the tree it's got
[2:09:28] to pass through the prophet then the
[2:09:31] fire forward Ministry make more sense
[2:09:33] which is what actually the prophet says
[2:09:35] that the men that are coming after me
[2:09:36] shall make more sense it doesn't mean
[2:09:38] that there's no sense in it but they
[2:09:40] shall expound further on it so that the
[2:09:42] fruit can what can really get to the
[2:09:44] life that is on that on the tree also um
[2:09:48] the the pastor asked a question says how
[2:09:50] do you know that it's the truth you see
[2:09:54] you have got um how do you know that
[2:09:56] this is actually the truth separated
[2:09:58] from every other doctrine that is being
[2:10:00] preached out there a lemon tree might be
[2:10:03] very close to an orange tree but how do
[2:10:07] you get to know that this is an orange
[2:10:09] tree and this is a lemon tree yeah is
[2:10:11] when you look at the fruits there of so
[2:10:13] personally I believe that any Ministry
[2:10:15] that will bear forth fruits that are
[2:10:17] Bible fruits M that is a true Ministry
[2:10:20] there is nothing to dispute about that
[2:10:22] amen you look at the ministry of the
[2:10:24] prophet and the fruits that it has
[2:10:26] actually given forth that these are
[2:10:28] actually biblical fruits yeah that is
[2:10:32] going to tell you everything about the
[2:10:33] source of where that life is coming from
[2:10:36] amen a watermelon plant might look
[2:10:40] exactly like a pumpkin plant but how do
[2:10:42] you know that this is the true
[2:10:44] watermelon is the fruit that comes out
[2:10:46] of the plant yeah so basically you know
[2:10:49] it's people who are you know who really
[2:10:51] don't understand how God really
[2:10:53] functions yeah you know when it comes to
[2:10:55] these things and you spoke about
[2:10:56] brotherly love I love David as an
[2:10:59] example the most because there is a time
[2:11:02] when he wanted to Siege another city and
[2:11:04] the crippled of that City went and stood
[2:11:06] before him they rejected him and David
[2:11:09] said in his own words I hate the
[2:11:10] crippled yeah at the same time they
[2:11:14] saw who was a man that was against him
[2:11:17] and they came a time when he wanted to
[2:11:19] show grace to the house of Saul yeah and
[2:11:22] they came with a one called meib yeah
[2:11:24] but when the uh when Zeba was asked he
[2:11:28] said but King he is a crippled he knew
[2:11:31] that that the king hated cripples first
[2:11:33] of all secondly he knew that he did not
[2:11:36] he he despised not despised as such but
[2:11:39] he somehow had a feeling towards so
[2:11:42] house because of how they treated him
[2:11:43] and everything so this was two of the
[2:11:46] things that he did not like but he chose
[2:11:49] to take him and sit down with him at his
[2:11:51] table first of all he was from the house
[2:11:52] of Saul secondly he was a David
[2:11:54] did not like cripples but you know I
[2:11:56] wonder why then God would say you know
[2:11:58] David is a man after my own heart and
[2:12:01] and all those things and um uh the
[2:12:05] question that I have now is
[2:12:08] that there are
[2:12:10] times you know when a man every man that
[2:12:14] is called of God like you said you feel
[2:12:16] like
[2:12:16] quitting but but before you get to feel
[2:12:19] like quitting there's something that
[2:12:21] comes first is you even doubt the
[2:12:24] calling that God gave to you on your
[2:12:26] life you begin to think did God even
[2:12:28] call me to begin with before you get to
[2:12:30] the quitting part it's it's something
[2:12:32] that just comes and maybe the passes but
[2:12:35] that thought will pass through your mind
[2:12:37] you're like but did God really hey you
[2:12:41] know you ask yourself that question it's
[2:12:44] a question that even you know some young
[2:12:46] ministers we ask ourselves a lot
[2:12:48] did God really call me you know you're
[2:12:50] looking at certain things and like but
[2:12:52] God could God call a man like me you
[2:12:54] know with a past like this one and you
[2:12:57] know all these things that I've gone
[2:12:58] through then you feel like ah the Devil
[2:13:00] comes and Whispers and says man you were
[2:13:02] not even called to begin with you feel
[2:13:04] like you know what let me just quit you
[2:13:06] know how do you get through that first
[2:13:09] stage to begin with that did God even
[2:13:12] call me to begin with yeah um I from
[2:13:17] Zimbabwe yes sir good okay mhm yeah not
[2:13:23] not I just wanted to know uh I think
[2:13:26] brother that's genuinely right brother
[2:13:30] Branham came to those moments many
[2:13:33] times and uh what causes
[2:13:37] that is when you really
[2:13:42] feel that you are not breaking
[2:13:45] through any a Ministry
[2:13:48] that always talks about hi hi hi hi hi
[2:13:53] everything is uh me everything is good
[2:13:56] is working out and you know I doubt
[2:14:01] whether he's being
[2:14:04] honest many
[2:14:06] times any
[2:14:08] Minister will get so
[2:14:11] low you remember brother
[2:14:15] brandham and the Seven Peaks mon pigs he
[2:14:19] says two small ones and then a big one
[2:14:22] then another and then a bigger one then
[2:14:24] so you know all those seven
[2:14:29] pics they
[2:14:33] typify you know change of
[2:14:36] ministry and uh you know nobody jumps
[2:14:40] from one pick to another for you to get
[2:14:43] the next Peck you come down to the
[2:14:46] valley brother Branham went through
[2:14:49] those valleys many times and he says
[2:14:53] your ministry is written in those
[2:14:56] mountains every
[2:14:58] Minister before he gets to another Peck
[2:15:01] God brings him down into the valley of
[2:15:04] prayer amen that's where you are tested
[2:15:08] before you are promoted to the next Peck
[2:15:11] even our lives the chemistry of Our
[2:15:14] Lives itself brother Branham had those
[2:15:17] seven
[2:15:19] Cycles you know he would pray for people
[2:15:22] on the platform then excuse himself run
[2:15:25] to be seek in the bathroom then come
[2:15:27] back to the platform again you know and
[2:15:30] sometimes you get into those conditions
[2:15:33] he's taking his children to school he
[2:15:36] listens to the radio and then they are
[2:15:38] talking Evolution and then that Spirit
[2:15:42] comes and says yeah I think God is not
[2:15:45] there could you imagine brother Branham
[2:15:49] that thought passing in his
[2:15:52] mind then God came back to him again if
[2:15:57] God is not
[2:15:58] there then God started shooting
[2:16:02] questions at him you know what heals
[2:16:05] those people when you pray for them if
[2:16:08] God is not there then the devil changes
[2:16:11] his mind and then he says he's there but
[2:16:14] he doesn't love
[2:16:16] you
[2:16:18] so you know the whole problem goes back
[2:16:21] to Eve you know in the garden when God
[2:16:24] created Adam he came from the seed genin
[2:16:28] but then Eve came from the body and so
[2:16:32] he Adam kind of had that pill of fire
[2:16:36] the theophan presence that was going
[2:16:38] along with him and that was the
[2:16:40] protection of Eve but when Eve went to
[2:16:44] meet the serpent she had walked away
[2:16:48] from her
[2:16:49] protection and then that's now when the
[2:16:53] devil now says did God say then says
[2:16:56] yeah we you know not even to touch he
[2:16:59] says Ah do you know why because you will
[2:17:03] become like a God knowing good and evil
[2:17:08] God had given man one channel and that
[2:17:12] is knowing good but now here is another
[2:17:16] Channel of knowing evil and then Eve had
[2:17:21] no way to control that channel it just
[2:17:25] opened up she had nowh pulling back that
[2:17:29] door and she ended up to where she went
[2:17:32] so sometimes because of that kind of
[2:17:35] history and then the hybridization we
[2:17:38] come through that door keeps swinging on
[2:17:42] us and then sometimes you even doubt
[2:17:46] whether you've been called and you start
[2:17:48] doubt whether you've been effective in
[2:17:50] the ministry all those things and the
[2:17:53] main problem is when you start you know
[2:17:57] looking at other cities you know because
[2:18:00] when they looked at other kingdoms they
[2:18:02] came back and said H give us a king want
[2:18:04] to be like those Nations so sometimes we
[2:18:08] are kind of thrown into a state like the
[2:18:12] prophet he goes to to Oklahoma and he
[2:18:15] sees Hon's thing and he he goes down and
[2:18:18] he sees oh Roberts and then he comes
[2:18:21] back and oh God so all those things will
[2:18:26] affect our ministry but when those
[2:18:28] things cross our mind then we need to go
[2:18:32] back and talk to God in prayer and God
[2:18:36] reassures you you know uh he reassures
[2:18:40] you in certain ways you are my servant
[2:18:43] you know breaks this Revelation breaks
[2:18:45] that Revelation he gives you you know
[2:18:48] like you know
[2:18:50] Ruth in the farm he said throw some for
[2:18:54] purpose behind for her so that's what
[2:18:57] God certainly does but honestly uh
[2:19:01] before you quit you evaluate yourself
[2:19:04] when that mind comes why did I fail here
[2:19:07] why can't I be like so and so why did
[2:19:10] all those things come yeah thank you
[2:19:14] well thank you H I think I'll give the
[2:19:15] chance also to two other brothers thank
[2:19:17] you brother
[2:19:17] Prince uh brother musi and well brother
[2:19:21] Joel is also planning to quickly come
[2:19:24] yes God bless you sir God bless you my
[2:19:27] brother I am really blessed by
[2:19:30] everything you've said and to be brief
[2:19:34] about and this is a young Minister by
[2:19:35] the way from he looks like his
[2:19:37] grandfather by the way
[2:19:39] yes I knew his
[2:19:41] grandfather okay yeah we interacted
[2:19:45] together in the Pentecostal World wow
[2:19:47] amazing
[2:19:48] yeah indeed indeed I was T by my uncle
[2:19:51] that you really told him that
[2:19:53] thing I want to I want to talk about the
[2:19:56] thing you've talked about when when the
[2:19:59] pastor asked you about your greatest
[2:20:01] regret in your life and Ministry and you
[2:20:05] say that when you sat back and then you
[2:20:07] realized it you made you made a
[2:20:10] statement and you made up your mind to
[2:20:14] keep the individuality of your call in
[2:20:17] your ministry now I want to talk about
[2:20:21] it concerning with the young ministers
[2:20:23] that are coming up indeed we really love
[2:20:26] to stay under the the tutorship of the
[2:20:30] elders because we really learn a lot
[2:20:32] indeed we do but then it comes there
[2:20:35] comes a time I don't know but some maybe
[2:20:40] some people I don't know if they have
[2:20:42] found it but there comes a time when
[2:20:43] there's more of a friction in the way
[2:20:47] way God wants you to go and what you're
[2:20:50] being told to do I don't know whether
[2:20:53] I'm being understood so well but there
[2:20:55] comes a time when you feel a pull to do
[2:20:58] something or to do to go somewhere but
[2:21:01] then the leadership or the tutorship or
[2:21:05] the person you're looking up to is more
[2:21:07] of telling you or what the you're being
[2:21:11] told makes you not to follow the thing
[2:21:14] that you're feeling and I don't know how
[2:21:18] you conflicting yeah conflict yeah I I
[2:21:22] tend to understand now you are getting
[2:21:26] two things uh mixed together
[2:21:30] one is uh
[2:21:33] you wanting to go you wanting to
[2:21:39] do you see that comes now down
[2:21:44] to the management
[2:21:47] of what you
[2:21:49] have yeah and then there is which is the
[2:21:56] tutorship has nothing to do with the
[2:21:58] management of your
[2:22:00] gift so there are two things that the
[2:22:04] tutor will help you to
[2:22:08] enlarg
[2:22:10] your understanding and your relationship
[2:22:14] to the word that's his part
[2:22:18] the other part I think uh you need to
[2:22:24] accept what we call management of your
[2:22:27] gift yeah sometimes when you are a young
[2:22:32] man and you are growing up in the
[2:22:35] ministry there is a lot of
[2:22:38] excitement and
[2:22:40] especially you know you you you you want
[2:22:43] to to to
[2:22:45] Glow uh like the people should see the
[2:22:48] fire which is okay but one thing
[2:22:54] is a man who is tutoring
[2:22:57] you of course I want you to have
[2:23:00] confidence in him because you could not
[2:23:04] have given your soul to a man that you
[2:23:07] have no confidence in so you also should
[2:23:12] believe that he wishes you good and when
[2:23:16] you start to go
[2:23:18] out you
[2:23:20] know you are
[2:23:22] getting into areas that he has been
[2:23:26] before so he can be able to guide
[2:23:31] you and I think that any true and good
[2:23:35] tutor a pastor you know who's helping a
[2:23:40] Ministry to
[2:23:41] grow he
[2:23:43] has uh good intention for it you
[2:23:48] understand what I mean so you know
[2:23:52] that's what God told the prophet that if
[2:23:55] you could get the people to believe you
[2:23:58] this doesn't work only for the prophet
[2:24:01] but for all the ministry that you know
[2:24:04] if you can get the people to believe you
[2:24:07] so even the people when they can be able
[2:24:10] to trust their Pastor so there is that
[2:24:13] kind of necessity of trying to find a
[2:24:17] working method with your with your
[2:24:19] pastor because you know when he's
[2:24:23] mentoring you he's trying to see where
[2:24:26] your gift can be best used he's not
[2:24:29] trying to say now you preach like this
[2:24:33] you understand what I mean so I think
[2:24:36] that way you'll just discover that the
[2:24:39] conflict will only be on how to carry
[2:24:42] your gift but not on what he's giving
[2:24:46] you on mentorship so even when we are
[2:24:50] going out it's necessary that we be in
[2:24:55] harmony yeah uh it's very very important
[2:24:59] because you see Paul could commission
[2:25:02] people you know he says Timothy go back
[2:25:05] to such and such a place I you know and
[2:25:08] then he says I left my court there you
[2:25:10] know so you know they are moving under
[2:25:13] instruction and I think that's very
[2:25:15] important uh um I'm such an oldfashioned
[2:25:20] man that I believe in the passing on of
[2:25:25] the
[2:25:25] blessing uh Paul could not go you know I
[2:25:30] mean they said that let us separate Paul
[2:25:33] and and Barnabas you understand what I
[2:25:36] mean but Paul was called of God directly
[2:25:40] but you see it required him to come
[2:25:43] under the uh mechanism and order of the
[2:25:47] church and they ordained him for the
[2:25:51] work of the ministry and so you know
[2:25:56] it's very very important that when maybe
[2:25:59] you are trying to go out you know take
[2:26:02] the blessing of the church with you take
[2:26:05] the blessing of your pastor with you and
[2:26:07] if you are going out to start a church
[2:26:10] why would you just go without his
[2:26:12] Blessing you know it would be nice to
[2:26:15] keep passing on that Apostolic anointing
[2:26:18] from one man to another there's a reason
[2:26:21] why God did it to allow the hands of an
[2:26:24] order to really help you yeah I give you
[2:26:29] an
[2:26:29] example this is
[2:26:32] Elijah he's about to go he's passing
[2:26:35] over his
[2:26:36] anointing we've got jeu we've got Elisha
[2:26:43] and Jos you know something like
[2:26:47] that uh but uh all of them took the
[2:26:52] anointing from
[2:26:55] Elijah but then
[2:26:58] jeu which is very important for the
[2:27:01] young
[2:27:02] ministers uh when he went out he
[2:27:06] overused that anointing you see and God
[2:27:11] was not happy in the book of HOSA he
[2:27:13] says there will never be another of the
[2:27:16] house of oosa come into that place of
[2:27:20] Duty but he was using real anointing for
[2:27:25] Elijah but you see the ministers
[2:27:28] sometimes become so tough and so rough
[2:27:33] with a god-given gift you know and
[2:27:37] Destroy because this man says oh I'm now
[2:27:40] also going to worship bow who are the
[2:27:43] people who are going to be bow
[2:27:45] worshipers all of them so they all came
[2:27:48] younger children and everybody and he
[2:27:51] killed all of them you see this message
[2:27:55] is not given to us just to destroy but
[2:27:59] to give life so I'm sure that in that
[2:28:03] way you are in relationship with your
[2:28:05] minister and then he wishes you well
[2:28:09] then submit and I'm sure that a man who
[2:28:13] is taking tutorship knows what he wants
[2:28:16] to get out of you I don't know whether
[2:28:18] I've answered your question you've
[2:28:20] answered it God bless I believe it's
[2:28:22] going to help many of us amen I asked it
[2:28:25] on behalf of the many that may not be
[2:28:27] here yes that was perfect wisdom brother
[2:28:30] Joel do you have a question we really do
[2:28:32] appreciate
[2:28:36] that amen God bless you Pastor God bless
[2:28:39] you we so
[2:28:40] blessed uh my question is I believe that
[2:28:45] preaching is a gift
[2:28:47] and the Bible says that gifts and
[2:28:49] calling without
[2:28:51] repentance uh in the one of the in the
[2:28:54] message the prophet says that no man has
[2:28:58] a right to preach without the baptism of
[2:29:01] the Holy Ghost yeah so clarify for me on
[2:29:04] that yeah
[2:29:07] certainly
[2:29:09] um no man has got a right to
[2:29:13] preach without the baptism of the Holy
[2:29:15] Ghost that's true and um I think any man
[2:29:20] who comes to the level of wanting to be
[2:29:23] a preacher should really have been
[2:29:26] concerned about am I really baptized
[2:29:30] with the Holy Ghost and it is something
[2:29:33] that he really seeks before he goes into
[2:29:36] that Ministry any meaningful Minister
[2:29:39] will have gone through that Junction
[2:29:42] because he knows that the ministry is
[2:29:46] not what you know but whom you
[2:29:50] know if the person is not there you are
[2:29:53] not taking anything we are taking the
[2:29:56] person of Christ to the people and
[2:29:59] that's now made manifest in Us by the
[2:30:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost so what you
[2:30:05] say is very very right and uh in a man
[2:30:10] who desires to be a minister and feels a
[2:30:14] call upon his life of course this call
[2:30:18] comes even when you are still a child
[2:30:20] there is something that keeps you know
[2:30:23] touching your conscience at that time
[2:30:26] you start looking you know for God it's
[2:30:29] just like Moses realizes his call but it
[2:30:33] takes him another 40
[2:30:35] years you know now the problem is
[2:30:39] sometimes um we are carried by
[2:30:45] enthusiasm like
[2:30:47] Simon you know he watched how Peter you
[2:30:52] know rebuked spirits and gave you know
[2:30:56] eternal life to people I mean the
[2:30:59] baptism of the Holy Spirit and then he
[2:31:02] says I've got some money here so give me
[2:31:05] that power that upon whose hand you know
[2:31:08] head I lay my hands so you know he was a
[2:31:13] gift on the other side you understand
[2:31:16] what I mean so he wanted to take this
[2:31:19] anointing and take it to that other side
[2:31:22] and use it for himself so you know uh
[2:31:27] but when Peter I mean when uh Moses got
[2:31:32] into the call feeling really like he has
[2:31:35] something to do just God himself if you
[2:31:39] are A God Called Ministry God will
[2:31:42] separate you to the back side of the
[2:31:44] desert it's just some kind of a a a
[2:31:48] feeling that will really get a hold of
[2:31:50] you and you really desire like God I
[2:31:53] feel like I'm burning you really seek
[2:31:56] for the bapm of the Holy Spirit you
[2:31:58] don't just need a shortcut like Simon
[2:32:01] you
[2:32:03] know yeah yeah thank you thank you
[2:32:05] Pastor now uh there's uh some other
[2:32:09] younger pastors that have just said is
[2:32:12] one wife been I think this is from H
[2:32:15] amen it says I'm blessed God bless you
[2:32:17] Pastor I and Pastor tala there's another
[2:32:20] Minister this brother has been going out
[2:32:21] to Cara uh Pastor EXA jeofrey says so
[2:32:26] encouraged God richly bless you pastors
[2:32:28] and there's also another one called
[2:32:31] Charles M says thanks brother B for
[2:32:33] these Arrangements we are blessed and
[2:32:35] God bless you Pastor I for the wise
[2:32:37] Council so uh Pastor EXA says Pastor I
[2:32:40] that's a special gift from God may he
[2:32:42] bless and anoint you more now uh allow
[2:32:46] me I know there are many other questions
[2:32:48] but after this I'm going to close my
[2:32:49] iPads I won't see any other question uh
[2:32:52] this one comes from yakob Hassan and he
[2:32:56] says God bless you dear Pastor what is
[2:32:58] your advice to this generation majorly
[2:33:02] on the two doctrines of tap Ministry
[2:33:05] only and the fivefold ministry I thought
[2:33:08] this is important and we could probably
[2:33:10] could deal with that before we close
[2:33:13] thank
[2:33:14] you um
[2:33:17] when brother
[2:33:18] [Music]
[2:33:20] Branham uh brought us this
[2:33:24] message God talked to him about storing
[2:33:28] the
[2:33:29] food and he put it on the
[2:33:32] types and forever and
[2:33:36] ever we have come this
[2:33:39] far because of the
[2:33:42] types how would we preach without those
[2:33:45] types
[2:33:48] and uh
[2:33:50] secondly I always tell
[2:33:53] people that uh if brother Branham was
[2:33:58] here he would not stop
[2:34:01] anybody to go out and
[2:34:05] preach and uh if he was
[2:34:09] here he wouldn't tell any of us that
[2:34:13] don't carry your Bible to the field
[2:34:16] just take the things that I've preached
[2:34:19] I'm sure he wouldn't do that so
[2:34:24] um
[2:34:27] always there is a
[2:34:32] problem maybe let me approach it this
[2:34:36] way that when God calls a
[2:34:39] minister he gives him sheep's
[2:34:44] food that doesn't mean mean that in the
[2:34:47] congregation there would be no
[2:34:51] Gods but he doesn't give him food for
[2:34:54] the gods the
[2:34:56] God so he gives him only food for the
[2:35:00] Sheep so what God gave us is sheep's
[2:35:04] food if people are trying to
[2:35:08] deviate from what God gave us the
[2:35:12] question would be are they gods
[2:35:17] mhm you see what I mean mhm yeah if they
[2:35:21] are
[2:35:22] sheep then they would desire the same
[2:35:26] food on the
[2:35:28] Taps but then the reason why people are
[2:35:33] saying only tpes only types is simply
[2:35:39] because they are trying to protect the
[2:35:44] people but who protects the
[2:35:48] people is it my work to protect
[2:35:52] you you know they are trying to protect
[2:35:55] the people from
[2:35:56] error but even God
[2:36:00] himself he knew there was
[2:36:03] hanania and there was
[2:36:07] Jeremiah you see what I mean God could
[2:36:10] not stop those men from prophesying
[2:36:12] exactly because the
[2:36:14] elect will never be
[2:36:17] deceived we've got enough food on the
[2:36:19] tapes and by the way I'm not against the
[2:36:23] tpes yes even playing them in church I'm
[2:36:28] not against it yeah but I stand back
[2:36:34] when you say therefore for the fivefold
[2:36:38] ministry has
[2:36:39] ceased because that
[2:36:42] one was given by by God himself it is
[2:36:48] sanctioned it's there in the
[2:36:51] Bible so you know we are told that if
[2:36:56] you take away from the Bible or if you
[2:36:59] add to the Bible so somebody must be
[2:37:04] very very strong to really say that from
[2:37:09] this day
[2:37:10] onwards Ephesians 4:11 is no longer part
[2:37:14] of the Bible M that would be dangerous
[2:37:18] and as long as it's still part of the
[2:37:20] Bible then I'm sure that God will allow
[2:37:24] me to preach up to the End Amen of time
[2:37:28] amen so you know I don't really think
[2:37:32] that we have another Junction we got the
[2:37:36] last Junction and the last instructions
[2:37:38] we had from Brother brandham are what we
[2:37:41] need amen yeah amen well to our viewers
[2:37:46] uh I think we've we are just coming to a
[2:37:48] clause uh we just titled this uh uh
[2:37:51] program the bench where we just sit on
[2:37:54] you knowes these benches and you know
[2:37:58] and just talk talk about the things of
[2:38:00] God and uh May main motive and purpose
[2:38:03] is really to impact the younger
[2:38:04] generation especially those entering
[2:38:06] into Ministry and other young people
[2:38:09] getting uh you know to understand what
[2:38:10] this message really stands for and what
[2:38:13] it is and how what we expected to do
[2:38:16] so uh here we uh talk to people like our
[2:38:20] Elder Pastor Steven who has lived a life
[2:38:23] of an example uh for the past 44 years
[2:38:26] in the ministry and has a lot of wisdom
[2:38:28] to share with us I just want to
[2:38:30] encourage you to take this link and
[2:38:32] share with whoever you feel it will be a
[2:38:35] blessing too we've been impacted here
[2:38:39] and we've we've fed we've sat under the
[2:38:42] oak tree and we are so blessed bless and
[2:38:45] uh before we we close I'd like you to
[2:38:47] just maybe give your closing remarks to
[2:38:49] to the viewers and uh just whatever that
[2:38:52] you feel on your heart to say yeah God
[2:38:55] bless you and uh certainly I've
[2:38:58] appreciated this
[2:39:00] opportunity um a man who doesn't always
[2:39:03] like to be highlighted so I was nervous
[2:39:07] about uh being invited before these
[2:39:11] cameras and talk to the people but um
[2:39:15] the min ministry as I said is just
[2:39:17] obedience to the leadership of the Holy
[2:39:20] Ghost and will certainly one step after
[2:39:24] another take you to your own God
[2:39:28] ordained fields in the Harvest so
[2:39:33] sometimes um we need to be satisfied
[2:39:36] with what God has made us because all of
[2:39:40] us will not be Bible teachers not all of
[2:39:43] us can be apostles
[2:39:46] but whatsoever part God has made us let
[2:39:49] us be satisfied with that that's the
[2:39:52] best way God would use us amen he has
[2:39:54] fitted Us in different ways and if your
[2:39:58] ministry is from God and mine is from
[2:40:01] God they'll always blend
[2:40:04] automatically yeah so I just want to
[2:40:08] encourage the young ministers that uh
[2:40:11] just keep obeying the leadership of the
[2:40:14] Holy Spirit
[2:40:16] uh when we believed there was no big
[2:40:19] examples for us to follow and it was
[2:40:22] very very good for us it was very good
[2:40:26] for us because there was no fields of
[2:40:29] competition at all yeah but U this
[2:40:33] present days you know uh young men
[2:40:36] always like to be like and it causes
[2:40:40] them a problem but just flow with the
[2:40:44] leadership of the Holy spirit and he
[2:40:47] will bring you to what he wants you to
[2:40:50] be so God bless you and uh uh keep the
[2:40:55] message and feed on the types and don't
[2:40:59] go into the
[2:41:00] extremes just keep going one day at a
[2:41:04] time amen God bless you amen thank you
[2:41:06] sir for the honor of having you today
[2:41:09] God bless you so much yeah God bless you
[2:41:11] viewers and we we'll see you again on
[2:41:14] another bench with uh with more men of
[2:41:16] God God bless you
[2:41:26] [Music]
[2:41:44] shalom
[2:41:52] [Music]
[2:42:44] for
[2:42:50] [Music]
