Lord and great shall be the Peace of thy children in righteousness shall thou be established thou shallal be far from oppression for thou shall not fear and from Terror for it is for it shall not come near thee behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold I have created the the Smith that bloweth the call in Fire and bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the water to destroy noon that is form against the shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shall condemn this is the heritage of the servant of the Lord and their righteous and their and their righteousness is of me says the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord Precious Jesus we thank you for the scripture for the portion of the word we have read for you say that you are the bread of life that comes from heaven and indeed Lord we pray that may the Holy Spirit Come and break this bread of life for us that each one of us will receive his portion tonight Lord Jesus merciful Jesus you know that I am just nobody but lord it's your grace and grace alone that you have given me to stand before your children may this word give life to each one of us us father you say that when you send your word it will not turn the same may it give life to the receiver and father by the end of this service Lord may you make Us Victorious we remember those who are streaming with us this night May you visit them as well in a special way remember our pastor is not here Lord father we thank you for we know that all things work together for good in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen may you have your seats I want to welcome you this evening in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen uh and I would love us to sit close I don't see why we we are scattered like that fact that voice was okay but like I wish you brother Peter do something blessed be the name of the Lord amen this evening I have a thought that I want us to sh share and uh I may not take long it's a prayer night but just pray for me that the Lord speaks to you amen and I call it that we are more than Overcomers blessed be the name of the Lord and I will depend on this very scripture we have read we are living in the time where we are fighting the battle amen but it's the Lord's battle it's not our battles because the Bible says that the battle is the Lord's amen and the Victory Is Ours blessed be the name of the Lord yeah so this night I just want us to remind ourselves that we are more than Overcomers amen we are more than Victorious blessed be the name of the Lord it pleased the Lord to choose us to fight the battle praise be to God you our Prophet tells us that this battle started in heaven and the devil was cast on Earth and still God did not leave the devil to come and torment us blessed be the name of the Lord but God had a plan before the foundation of the world that will come and engage the devil even on Earth praise be to God and we are the people chosen this generation we are the people elected we are the people ordained to fight this battle and if you think uh you are small I'm here to remind you that you are more than Overcomers blessed be the name of the Lord amen he says here that and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the Peace of thy children Amen in righteousness shall thou be established thou shall be far from operation blessed be the name of the Lord the word of God is telling us that we shall be far from operation from operation of the devil blessed be the name of the Lord amen he said that in righteousness the only way we can be established that is e e name of the Lord and this evening I'm here to remind you that brethren we are more than Overcomers last Wednesday we talking about it's not yet over amen that when we think that we are failing when the devil thought I remember one time Pastor preach and said when the devil thought that he had won amen praise be to God so most the time that's what the enemy thinks but the word is telling us that in righteousness shall we be established whosoever Shall Gather against me they shall fall amen the Lord will Smite him and say no that is formed against me you can put yourself as well shall prosper uh brother Bram says here that that I know this to be the truth I know people don't realize who you are every person in here can live above sin can live without sin amen live in God you will make mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you blessed be the name of the Lord I know that every people don't realize who you are and if God can help us know that tonight he says that we can live above sin we can live without sin and we can live in God and when we live above sin and we live without sin and we live without when we live in God we are more than Overcomers blessed be the name of the Lord because if we have those three we are more than Overcomers and if they only realize who you are you are Sons and Daughters of God hairs of the Kingdom right now we are Kings claiming your legal rights don't let Satan press anything on you blessed be the name of the Lord don't let s press even sleep on you because we are more than Overcomers praise be to God we are the army that the Lord has chose to fight and we are here to fight sin amen we are to fight the enemy with all his Devils blessed be the name of the Lord and we are all to live above sin and living above sin meaning living in the word walking according to the word of God blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why we have come here we have come to remind ourself above this word because the Bible tells us to confort one another with this word blessed be the name of the Lord amen he said listen you are Covenant people of God and God tear Christ apart at Calvary making the Covenant an swearing by himself and he took the body up into heaven which will return Someday by the spirit he gave back to lead the church in the same life that was in Christ Jesus in the is in the church tonight by the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord we cannot overcome without the help of the Holy Spirit and that's why Jesus told them T ye on the upper room until you be endured with the power from above blessed be the name of the Lord and when that power comes in us there we become there that's when we are more than Overcomers because not be us fighting the battle but is Jesus in us fighting our battles blessed be the name of the Lord amen and what the church need tonight that's all that we need to realize that Jesus is here Jesus is back to lead the church again the Holy Ghost is here to lead the church to give us that Victory blessed be the name of the Lord we cannot be established in righteousness unless we have the portion of him praise be to God and when he the Holy Ghost is come that portion of Christ where he is in US that is our Victory praise be to God he said that men and women it is time that we found out who we are that the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you are some little troed down something but you are not you are Sons and Daughters of God the deity is not in heaven but it is in you blessed be the name of the Lord he said that noon formed against us shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shall condemn it and this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord our heritage is Victory blessed be the name of the Lord amen we have no promise of being overcome amen but we are more than Overcomers God gave us the promise in his word blessed be the name of the Lord whether you living in sin or whether you're living a defeated life you ought not to live a defeated life because the promise we have in the word of God is to live above sin to live a Victorious Life blessed be the name of the Lord that is what God has given us in this generation and he has made it more clear To Us by sending us Malachi 4 when we used to when we in still in Pentecostal when someone corrects you it's so beautiful you know as a Christian we ought to live an life of example but sometime you do something which is contrary to what you believe and when someone comes to correct you I remember those days uh I I think I've I said it once one time many years back but I heard it from someone who was an elder when someone say but Salvation is not purchased by man you can also buy you can also go get one blessed be the name of the Lord but when we come this side is different story our Prophet tells us that we should live the gospel than preaching blessed be the name of the Lord It's a mandate for every Christian to live a life of an example blessed be the name of the Lord where while it looks hard but when God by the hope of the Holy Spirit it is very possible praise be to God amen amen praise the Lord so here he tells us that noon formed against us shall prosper God has given us his word and he expect us to live a Victorious Life praise be to God Christ when he rose from the dead in the message that on Calvary braam tells us that on that day on Calvary every sin question was settled there and today even when we are living below our privileges we ought to look back and see what Jesus did on Calvary amen our strength is on Calvary and the devil's weakness is also on Calvary because when he looks there he remembers what happened to him amen and that's why brother bam says that a Christian should never forget Calvary we should remember Calvary always in our life because that is where our Victory is blessed be the name of the Lord when I'm weak I will look at Calvary where jesus carried my sin when I'm defeated I will look unto Calvary and remember that Jesus died and rose again blessed be the name of the Lord when I'm sick I will look un Calvary and remember that by his stripes I am healed blessed be the name name of the Lord that's why it's a mandate for us to remember Calvary in every days of our life blessed be the name of the Lord butam say that when we repent of our sin the blood of Jesus breaks that sin amen it's like a Clorox he say it's like a Clorox or call it as like a j that When sin is thrown in the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus will break it and make take it and take it back Amen to its origin where it came from and you know what we all know that the devil is the origin of sin blessed be the name of the Lord so when we repent our sins and our sins is in the blood of Jesus we are sinless and when we are sinless we are Overcomers blessed be the name of the Lord amen and that's why he say that noon formed against Earth shall prosper there are many many weapons amen there are many things there are many devices of the devil there are many ways that the enemy fights us but our one target or our one ambition is to look unto the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord he said but let me uh he said let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God Lives in You Immortal Life my life I give you Zoe the life of God is in human being amen what I'm trying to do is to get to the Pentecostal people to let them realize who they are of Faith through here till they all to be sorry okay he say that when they realize Faith they realize who who they are that they of Faith here till it wouldn't be a sick person that would be in need of having a prayer line if the people that is here realize who they are oh brother that is born that's that's s that's born again and the son and daughter of God call equal with Jesus Christ in his presence oh that is what makes the devil angry is Let the Church of God realize who they are blessed be the name of the Lord when we realize that we are more than Overcomer we are more than conqueror you see people who are well trained say in the military world Amen they are very sure that they are going to win blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord because they know the kind of training they went in they know the kind of the enemy they are engaging blessed be the name of the Lord when Jesus went to the gra of the grave of Lazarus the bible say that Jesus wept Jesus sympathized with them amen with their unbelief he was mourning with them blessed be the name of the Lord but to Jesus that was a simple matter before him blessed be the name of the Lord by the time for that problem amen and when Jesus stood and said that roll away the stone that was different story blessed be the name of the Lord and we are an God praise be to God because he said that the works he did shall we also do and even greater work praise be to God so Brethren praise be to God so it is the time to exercise your faith amen because this is the promise to Believers you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we want to hear those testimonies in our midest don't say it's for Pentecostal God never said this for Pentecostal he says this for every believer not only pastors not only deacons not only evangelist but each and every believer blessed be the name of the Lord by the way how sure are you that you a believer are you sure that you are believer are you sure that you are saved praise be to God are you sure that you are on Overcomer are you sure that you're more than a conqueror ever since you got saved how many demons have you cast out how many patient have you prayed for as an individual not as a church let us pray for Brother Martin seek oh Father we pray for him in the this assignment was given to Believers go therefor into the world preach the gospel amen whoever believes and baptized shall be [Applause] saved and this sign shall follow them that believe believes the sign follows Believers amen so if you want to know that you're a Believer it is right time not a Believer following the sign no sir the sign supposed to follow you praise be to God and I'm here to remind that we are more than Overcomers and this is the time to prove that we are more than over come amen don't let those devil relax don't let those devil settle amen hunt for them praise be to God but Believers have relaxed but demons are not troubled at all because Saints have relaxed but for the demons they have not relaxed see demons at work Believers slumbering praise be to God but Jesus gave us assignment and the ABC of a Believer is you shall cast out demons in my name because he never said those son shall follow Sinners you said Brother Martin but Jesus said that on that day many will come we cast out demon in his name yes go cast them in his name blessed be the name of the Lord because the Bible tells us that noon formed against us shall prosper no demon has a right to torment believer no habit has a right to torment you no stuation has a right to trample on you amen because we are given Authority blessed be the name of the Lord we have the authority of the word we have the Mandate of the word amen to live above demons to give them hard time when you hear that demons are tormenting your neighbor don't lock your door blessed be the name of the Lord God is training you for those duties every time you come here you are undergoing training you undergoing training amen you are receiving training and special assignment blessed be the name of the Lord in one of these days God is going to assign you somewhere brother sister you'll be busy in your shop they'll bring someone with Epsy for you to pray for will you take off brother diction will be at school and they will bring a m person to you let me first call my pastor let me go pray and fast for 40 days one time I was talking to one brother and we discussing over this very things but brother you see Jesus had FY Vision I told him that Jesus never told us you fy Vision to pray for the sick but he told us this sign shall follow them that believeth hey amen let us not give excuses when you are faced with such a situation brother stand on your feet because it's not you working it is the word of God God sent his word and it's what heals amen so when you're faced with such a scenario stand on your two feet amen Lay Your Hands on the sick I don't care whe the person is dead where the person is mad where the person is sick where the person is bound stand on your feet lay your hands on him amen oh her and pray for the person and you will see what the Lord will do amen because the battle is the Lord is and we are more than Overcomers we are more than conquerors Amen in our Gene we have a overcoming Gene Amen in our DNA we have a overcoming DNA blessed be the name of the Lord wherever we go we are more than Overcomers praise be to God and the devil knows that praise the Lord that's why even when you came when attacked Jesus he told that if you are the Son of God if because always is a doubter praise be to God that's why the prophet said when the church will know who they are and where they stand for amen he said we shall be an invisible Army praise the Lord praise be to God the prophet says here I'm not not a sinner neither are you we got a sacri a sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voices but he sees the blood of Jesus the blood of Christ that is all he sees between us and great Jehovah is the blood of his son Jesus and the blood shall speak for us amen the blood shall speak for you and me amen when you're praying for sick brother sister the prophet say that God has not even look at you he hear your voice amen and the blood of Jesus will speak for you and me amen they may be reputated they may be questioned indeed to human mind they may not even seems to qualify nevertheless they are the messenger for their age God is Abraham he lied he used Moses he rebelled he used the Jonah he disobeyed he used Samson he sinned David he murdered he used Joshua and Joseph and those with surve blam for out far outnumbered those whose history seems to be perfect and all we are and are is none dare deny that he used them by and through the holy spirit that he put within them praise be to God when God put his holy spirit within you it is the Holy Ghost doing the work in you that's why we must receive the Holy Spirit that's why we must receive the Holy Spirit blessed be the name of the Lord amen so my brethren I wonder how many of us go to the hospital to check on the sick and pray for them praise be to God because the sun shall follow the sun will not come at your home I say I've come to follow you my brother you must trigger it amen God has put all the potential in us but we must do something to trigger these potentials when God was still Elohim in him was redemption in him was healing in him was Deliverance amen he was a Healer he's still a Healer is even he's still a Healer today blessed be the name of the Lord but when God was still living alone those attribute were not manifested praise be to God but there came a time when this attribute must be manifested praise the Lord Adam had to fall for God to manifest the Redemption ability blessed be the name of the Lord but when we just sit and relaxa he had something substantial something was clinging to the reason that's why sometime we are drifted is because we have never had any experience with God apart from clapping hands in church but my brother my sister there is a time when you're are going to be squeezed at the corner somewhere where only what will make you go through or believe God that God will bring you out is what the Lord has helped you to go through blessed be the name of the Lord so each one of us we need that experience praise be to God very many people are being toasted and drifted here and there they run with two Lords four Lords what it is still the where the problem is is because they have never met that God that's why when someone comes with huge money ah he says why he has not got an experience and after we start growing there's nothing we can do as far as we are our well-being is concerned but God gives us the grace little by little amen the way you are this year I believe you're not it's not the way you were last year the way you were last month is not the way you are today because the Bible tells us that we are moving from glory to glory From Grace to Grace praise be to God and we all to check ourself we are bound to examine ourselves am I growing or not are we overcoming or not praise be to God because every day gone that day will never come back when the seed is planted in the ground that seed when it the moment it germinate it will start growing going upwardly praise be to God and even farmers will be so concerned to do the follow up them they become like a weed praise be to God but my prayer and My Cry is that God let me be the right seed let me grow at your pace amen sometime we don't want to grow at God's place we want to be God's grandchildren praise be to God but God called us to be more than conquerors he has given us all the protection and he says for your sake a thousand will fall for your sake they will rise against but they will not even come near you praise be to God and in righteousness shall we be established no weapon formed against you talk of those weapons no fornication no blast no babing no theft no witchcraft no murderer no backsliding amen God never call us to backslide no sir that's why we don't need to worry whether you're going to backslide tomorrow and you are saved brother you are liar faith is unconscious and they went there to attack before they realize they were naked and running praise be to God because when they confronted the guy they told him that we are chasing the name of Jesus whom Paul Paul cast then the man said that but Paul we know him he always gives us that time but who are you that's what happened to them but for us we know that we are children of God if you doubt that that's up to you but I know I'm a Child of God but but the other day yes that day but I am a child of God but sister we had that so yes you are but I'm a Child of God the other day took some so and so whatever brother it is true but I never sign agreement with God that when this happen I'm no longer your child praise be to God let the devil not lie you because you ate Daddy's sugar and the Devil comes and Whisper to you he's no longer your father he hates you tell the devil it is Daddy's sugar praise be to God because you ate Daddy's meat the enemy can't say you know what it's no longer your dad it's Daddy's meat the blood of Jesus will never lose it power until all the ransom Church of God until all of them are saved to sin no more as long as the bride is still here the blood of Jesus is still active praise be to God I don't believe that our genuine Christian will sin willfully but you will be Tred but let me tell you that blood is still active it is still working on you amen but when I'm tell this body is not saved but he will be saved in the twinkling of an eye praise be to God but there's a inner man we carry amen is the one who is saved is the one who pleads every time he crying that's why the Bible says that our spirit praise be to God Amen it's Christ Our Father our spirit with his Spirit blessed be the name of the Lord so let us look at what God did for us let us look at the ability of God the grace of God in our life even when your brother Strays help him to rise let us not TR our brother say who told you brother we haven't reached the Finishing Line amen but you're running the race toward the Finishing Line how sure are you don't be surprised when that brother will enter fast there's a children story of the T and the ha the ha knew that he's a very first animal amen but one day the T I stole the hair that you know I want overtake in the race and the guy laughed and laughed and laughed I said Hey in the race Mr to was so comfortable yes blessed be the name of the Lord so one day I believe you already know the story I'm talking about they went for the race and this man was even sleeping when the to I started and then all of a sudden he came out like a lightening at a lightening speed and Mr T was comfortable blessed be the name of the Lord Mr T was feeding on the word and Mr T no he knew that the rest is not for the Swift amen praise be to God so the man was so comfortable he had his faith amen and Mr ha thought or knew that the race was for the Swift finishing L that's why the Bible tell us let us lay aside every sin every weight of that do easily beset us let us run the rest with pacience amen looking unto Jesus amen Mr a looked at his ability Mr toas look at the he looked at the Finishing Line praise be to God Finishing Line so my brethren as we are running in this race there are many enting things of the world but let us not be distracted by the things of the world praise be to God let us focus on the word let us run with the word we are more than Overcomers blessed be the name of the Lord we are we are more than conquerors Jesus fought for us amen even when things seems not to be working out let us wait on God because at least we have something that the world does not have when Jesus went the grave of Lazarus one of the sister one of the Lazarus sister knew that Jesus had something special in him he said Master if you were here my brother would not die but even now amen that is what the believer has but even now Lord amen though the stuation the condition has gone B but even now we know that when you pray God will answer when you pray God will hear amen and when Jesus had that Faith praise be to God he said roll out weather stone that Chang in fact that changed everything when said roll a weather Stone blessed be the name of the Lord so brethren we are more than conquerors no weapon formed against us there are many people have spoken bad words against you very many people spoke bad word against my sister who got married last year who but today the whole story changed blessed be the name of the Lord I believe each one of us here there are people are speaking some negative word against you you're not going to make it oh even your grandfather failed even your he was a minister he back lead but we're not going to back lead we're not here to back slide we are here to declare the glory of God God called us for a purpose there are better people and smart people in the world but God left them and came for you in your weakness in you in fact God knows very well the Habit you are fighting with today he knows that every now you try and again you fail but let me tell you there is a point where that answer is amen God is waiting for you at that corner where that habit will never disturb you anymore praise be to God many time message Believers want we want to live like angels brother forgetful it's only God blessed be the name of the Lord but let me tell you if you don't have those like uh if you don't have that kind of background you will not know the grace of God in your life but today when you look at someone who is big pocketing others you remember where that Grace dragged you from amen and you will lift your hands and thank god with even tears that God I thank you because I was once like that fell but that Grace found me amen and today I'm living a Victorious Life each one of us we have down our ups and down including our parents they have their ups and down but God never told us to look at those ups and down when he looked at us he see more than conquerors when God looked at he see Overcomers amen and even right now he's seeing bunch of Overcomers seated here because that's what he called us for blessed be the name of the Lord amen but what I'm say that in commentary was written and when Paul wrote Abram's commentary he never mentioned one thing about Abram's unbelief no no no never was even accounted to him he said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God Amen so my brothers and my sisters let us be strong amen keep giving praises to God brother just keep giving praise to God multiple times winners never quit and quits they don't win amen even in the grave he is Lord even in sickness he is Lord of Lord over that sickness even when we are broke he is Lord over that Brokenness even when we are rejected he is Lord over that because we are more than Overcomers praise be to God we are more than conquerors and we are living in the generation where which we are living the time when we have the revealed word of the hour and when we are talking about this we know it very well that's why for [Applause] we have to fight amen and we are fighting with the demons we are fighting serious battles blessed be the name of the Lord so friends let us cast out demons however there are cases when God can reveal it to you but brother Dixon is sick and you want First Vision to pray for him blessed be the name of the Lord ever been with AB we will not have terrorist in the world we not have Al shababs in the world praise be to God we would be enjoying they so excited with what they believe the God who only knows Arabic you Jesus is Worthy to be glorified he worthy to be praised it's worth to be shouted just Jesus because even when we just shout Jesus demons they like What's Happening Here amen because we are more than Overcomers we are more than Overcomers we are more than conquerors when Jesus went in Hell remember Lucifer fell with a third of angels but one Jesus when he went in the grave my brother my sister demons had to look for holes to flee Satan is just a spirit the devil is weak so the devil has to look for a body whether it's of human being or whether it's that devil manifest in many ways blessed be the name of the Lord I remember one time we living in bua island and there was one man he say that it was in the afternoon he had somebody knocking at his door when he came to see was knocking he found an animal I think was was about a cat something of that kind but had a human voice and and from there the man fell down was unconscious he's dying so the demon Satan that's why when you backl the devil will use you to do things which you will not even imagine just imagine someone goes before the camera and recalls himself as of naked that's what the devil is doing because he must get a body to operate in and the same when God is not in the body God is weak but when God gets the vessel to use amen one Samson s a thousands of philis Amen because there was one man who healed his body his soul to be used by God and that's what God want even today and that's why it pleased him to put on flesh and come and dwell Among Us so friends we are more than Overcomers even when you at school just know that I went through school by the grace of God I never messed up I went to campus and never messed up blessed be the name of the Lord what was that the grace of God God is more than conqueror we've been Bewitched I don't know how many time but none of us have been affected by witchcraft we have been intimidated multiple times but none of those things have ever happened to us why because we are more than conqueror in Christ Jesus and now we been formed against as shall prosper my father worked for the forces until he retired last year but for all his life in forces there's no man that has ever Rose against him who lived un punished life others lost their lives but that's what happened to believer when we have God we have security let us not losing our Focus let us focused on Christ blessed be the name of the Lord yeah shall We rise on our feet but when I'm saying this message the date of Jesus Christ that the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that got the Holy Ghost amen he says in the message of the invisible Union of the bride of Christ that you were for ordained to a Son of God and were in God before the foundation of the world and you are only manifested in this day for his for his honor and glory and the last quote it say that if there wasn't a Lo to that son and daughter of God would create them a world out here and go live privately private life on it you have the power in you to do it and if you've got the shadow of the power of God in you the shadow you've got the power to do it God is om poent so see what I mean the power that is in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are praise be to God we can speak situations change our atmosphere change our testimony praise be to God we have that Authority God has given us that Grace we have got that power may the good Lord bless you Precious Jesus thank you for the word you've sent us this evening I trust that Lord somebody has been blessed and I pray that may the Holy Spirit follow
