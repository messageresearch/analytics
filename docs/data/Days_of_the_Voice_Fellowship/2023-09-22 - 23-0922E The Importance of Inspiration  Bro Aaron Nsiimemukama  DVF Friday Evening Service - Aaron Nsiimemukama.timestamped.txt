[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:13] Praise Him
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:18:11] foreign
[1:18:39] so after the preaching we just have a
[1:18:41] little prayer and then we can dismiss
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:47] so we thank God the brother is already
[1:18:49] here
[1:18:51] to sit down
[1:18:53] Nina
[1:18:59] so uh
[1:19:01] I've not known
[1:19:04] uh personally brother Aaron for long in
[1:19:08] the government
[1:19:12] uh uh I don't think I've even ever had
[1:19:15] interactions with him that much
[1:19:21] but from the few people that attend this
[1:19:24] church that have told me
[1:19:32] no told me that is a good Minister
[1:19:35] and I had an interaction with him on
[1:19:37] phone sometime back
[1:19:41] and from our composition we agreed that
[1:19:45] whenever he comes around Kampala you
[1:19:47] should let me know so he the church can
[1:19:49] also be blessed by his ministry
[1:19:56] so the devil doesn't usually like
[1:20:00] like such good things
[1:20:04] but he can't stop it
[1:20:07] no I always tell you that the devil can
[1:20:09] only you know the devil doesn't have the
[1:20:12] power or authority to disappoint goddess
[1:20:15] program for your life
[1:20:21] he doesn't have the power to stop it
[1:20:27] too late
[1:20:30] so sometimes
[1:20:33] you know for example job was destined
[1:20:35] for greatness
[1:20:38] and the devil didn't like it
[1:20:42] when the Devil Went before God
[1:20:46] he was jealousy
[1:20:49] what God had given to job
[1:20:52] and he told him because you are blessed
[1:20:56] to him
[1:20:57] but you see God said okay if you think
[1:21:01] so
[1:21:02] you can go and touch everything
[1:21:09] so the whole time
[1:21:12] it was just delaying the destiny of jobs
[1:21:18] but it could not hinder it
[1:21:21] because God told the devil but don't
[1:21:23] touch his soul
[1:21:26] and the devil couldn't touch itself
[1:21:30] so whatever God has purpose for your
[1:21:32] life
[1:21:39] whatever you will be you will be
[1:21:42] rejection whatever we were supposed to
[1:21:44] receive this evening
[1:21:48] the devil cannot hinder him
[1:21:51] Hallelujah man he can't stop it
[1:21:54] praise the Lord Brother finally I'm told
[1:21:58] he's arrived here
[1:22:01] and a few moments will be stepping to

[1:32:35] Hands
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:42] Saturday we are consecrated
[1:32:46] and after being consecrated
[1:32:50] meant that they can now bear the actress
[1:33:01] that's why Jesus began Ministry after
[1:33:03] 30.
[1:33:06] John the Baptist was in the bush for 20
[1:33:09] years then came when he was 29 and a
[1:33:12] half and began baptism
[1:33:18] I had always wondered what Jesus was
[1:33:22] doing up to that is
[1:33:33] a high priest of all eternity
[1:33:37] he had to follow the orders
[1:33:40] because he was a perfect picture
[1:33:45] of the Old Testament
[1:33:49] I believe brother tell him
[1:34:08] 50 years
[1:34:10] they would deserve up to 50.
[1:34:17] then they would kind of like a retire
[1:34:21] but not to see it but that burden would
[1:34:25] be off
[1:34:30] they would continue
[1:34:34] and continue like that
[1:34:37] praise be the name of the Lord amen
[1:34:42] God revealed that to me recently because
[1:34:45] I made it started this year
[1:34:53] and you think actually that you are in
[1:34:56] your calling
[1:34:57] when you are just
[1:35:04] you know God sent us a prophet in this
[1:35:07] last days
[1:35:10] and Elijah was to do two things
[1:35:15] to open the the Seven Seals
[1:35:20] right and to restore
[1:35:25] to restore the children
[1:35:29] back to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:35:34] back to the Pentecostal experience
[1:35:44] but you know he was he preached many
[1:35:47] times
[1:35:49] until 1947.
[1:35:52] when actually God says now you are going
[1:35:55] to begin
[1:35:57] to do that
[1:36:03] which God called him foreign
[1:36:31] don't just be a church member today I
[1:36:34] always remember understand the syllabus
[1:36:36] again
[1:36:38] amen understand the spiritual syllabus
[1:36:43] where should I reach
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:47] and now evaluate yourself
[1:36:50] and ask God for Grace
[1:36:58] so he brought that message from 1947.
[1:37:06] now the second one was fulfilled in
[1:37:10] 1963.
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:21] and imagine
[1:37:22] a praise be the name of the Lord
[1:37:25] amen amen and we pray that may God give
[1:37:30] give us Grace
[1:37:32] to find our position in Christ before we
[1:37:36] have faith
[1:37:38] praise be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:41] Christ
[1:37:42] so I'm not much of a vibrant preacher
[1:37:51] uh not because I don't like it but do
[1:37:54] not have it
[1:37:57] analysis special Grace
[1:38:01] you know when the grace Came Upon the
[1:38:03] the donkey of uh of baram it spoke oh my
[1:38:07] name is
[1:38:18] that was the last time
[1:38:22] a horse a donkey a mule preached a
[1:38:26] Prophet
[1:38:29] by Word of Mouth
[1:38:36] I mean
[1:38:38] praise be the name of the Lord
[1:38:41] so for I won't preach wrong
[1:38:46] most of the times when I'm preaching I
[1:38:49] don't use a lot of times
[1:38:56] praise be the name of the Lord
[1:38:58] so uh I want us that you we stand up
[1:39:03] I just want to preach about a simple
[1:39:05] subject
[1:39:08] amen the importance of inspiration
[1:39:17] uh inspiration and anointing
[1:39:23] looked more like the same company
[1:39:28] praise be the name of the Lord and I
[1:39:31] think the word anointing
[1:39:38] because you know when they would be
[1:39:40] translating
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:43] sometimes they would come across a Greek
[1:39:45] word that has no direct meaning in
[1:39:47] English
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:55] and then they would create a word
[1:39:58] because those are the fathers of English
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:04] if you have an a Very personalized
[1:40:09] highly and deep in Uganda language
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:25] did you know that how many know the
[1:40:27] words
[1:40:41] I mean so the word anointing and
[1:40:44] inspiration
[1:40:47] but I want to talk on the side of
[1:40:50] inspiration
[1:40:54] we are going to go to Second Corinthians
[1:40:57] to
[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:04] and we want to look at verse 3
[1:41:14] the Bible says that for as much you are
[1:41:18] manifestly declared to be the episode of
[1:41:21] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:41:25] ink but we see the spirit of the Living
[1:41:29] God not in the tables of stone but in
[1:41:32] the fleshly tables of the hearts
[1:41:35] and such trust have we through Christ to
[1:41:39] go to God word
[1:41:41] note that we are sufficient of ourselves
[1:41:45] to think anything as of ourselves but
[1:41:49] our sufficiency is of God
[1:41:53] foreign
[1:42:31] can we just see close our eyes for just
[1:42:34] a word of prayer
[1:42:37] Heavenly Father this is the word of God
[1:42:39] foreign
[1:43:09] to its perfect meanings
[1:43:14] that we may receive a perfect revelation
[1:43:18] we may receive perfect understanding
[1:43:22] that the man inside of us
[1:43:26] may be made perfect
[1:43:33] fully furnished
[1:43:35] in the knowledge of truth
[1:43:39] that you are very your very life you

[1:43:47] and in our lives every day in the name
[1:43:51] of Jesus Christ amen

[3:53:39] [Applause]
[3:53:43] that is what we believe
[3:53:45] we believe that's what we believe we
[3:53:47] stand for that
[3:53:48] do we believe that every bit of it
[3:53:51] we believe that
[3:53:53] amen you know let me tell you let me
[3:53:55] tell you let me tell you as uh they're
[3:53:58] going to bring the offerings back
[3:53:59] offering bags and we are going to
[3:54:01] dismiss I want to tell you this
[3:54:03] we believe this message with all our
[3:54:05] hearts
[3:54:07] and we have one agenda the rapture
[3:54:12] did you hear that we have one agenda the
[3:54:14] word the Rapture everything else is a
[3:54:17] bonus
[3:54:18] the the message must produce a rapture
[3:54:22] and who is going to benefit out of the
[3:54:24] rapture you and me we are the ones the
[3:54:27] messages for us
[3:54:28] now let me also say this the preacher
[3:54:30] preached it something that I've also
[3:54:32] said in one of the services here when
[3:54:34] the word of God is going on
[3:54:36] you must learn to receive it personally
[3:54:41] you know
[3:54:43] an inspiration oh my if I go in there
[3:54:47] I'm going to preach another sermon
[3:54:49] but I tell you what let me tell you
[3:54:52] myself I don't study I don't go to look
[3:54:55] in the Bible or into the message to find
[3:54:57] something to preach to you until I
[3:55:00] receive inspiration some people were
[3:55:03] telling us that you see now you know we
[3:55:06] believe the message is inspired brother
[3:55:07] Barnum is a prophet to our generation
[3:55:09] Malachi 4 5 Revelation 27 that is
[3:55:12] inspired we cannot add we cannot take
[3:55:15] away amen
[3:55:16] now some people are telling us we only
[3:55:19] have to listen to those steps and we
[3:55:21] cannot preach
[3:55:22] because the prophet of the age is the
[3:55:25] only one inspired yes is the only one
[3:55:28] inspired as the prophet of the age but
[3:55:31] is not the only one receiving
[3:55:32] inspiration from the Holy Spirit why
[3:55:35] because Jesus Christ is the same
[3:55:37] yesterday today and forever
[3:55:40] and and brother Barnum said I preach
[3:55:43] what
[3:55:44] Paul Paul preached now brother Barnum
[3:55:47] did not read repeatedly only the words
[3:55:50] of Paul he was receiving inspiration
[3:55:52] from God and taking what Paul preached
[3:55:55] and then he preaches it to the people
[3:55:57] so you see that's why every preacher
[3:56:00] must have inspiration
[3:56:02] I believe you I don't know you did not
[3:56:04] tell us how you received this message
[3:56:06] which You Preach to us today but I
[3:56:07] believe you received the inspiration to
[3:56:09] preach it
[3:56:10] so every preacher must receive
[3:56:12] inspiration now that's the preacher but
[3:56:15] not the people also he read for us the
[3:56:17] qualities here didn't you hear it I'm
[3:56:19] not going to repeat it again you see you
[3:56:21] also to receive the word you must
[3:56:23] receive it by inspiration
[3:56:25] if you just sit look if the preacher
[3:56:28] doesn't wait for inspiration and it just
[3:56:31] comes on the pulpit to preach things
[3:56:33] that he has read it will be dry void of
[3:56:36] the spirit
[3:56:37] foreign
[3:56:51] and I'm going to bring it to you now if
[3:56:55] it comes to you and you just listen as
[3:56:57] if you are listening to a comedian or to
[3:57:00] a teacher or to some other you know man
[3:57:03] who is reading for you some newspaper
[3:57:05] you will receive nothing
[3:57:07] but if you if you receive it and you
[3:57:09] receive you receive as inspiration
[3:57:11] listen listen
[3:57:13] and you receive it as inspiration from
[3:57:15] God
[3:57:19] I don't even think you can you can sit
[3:57:21] the whole time in the service
[3:57:23] I'm telling you the truth
[3:57:25] it is impossible for you to sit in the
[3:57:27] chair on one position
[3:57:29] and you don't move away from there
[3:57:34] it is impossible for me to when the
[3:57:36] preacher is preaching
[3:57:38] for me to be in one place
[3:57:40] I feel like fire why because I'm
[3:57:42] receiving inspiration like yeah move
[3:57:45] stand up receive it accept it you know
[3:57:48] because it is what it is inspiration
[3:57:53] inspiration go back and listen to that
[3:57:54] message I believe it was that quote was
[3:57:56] from the message you hear ye him
[3:57:58] yes here ye him
[3:58:00] go go and listen to that message I'm
[3:58:03] sure you'll be blessed here you hear me
[3:58:05] 1956 God bless you I don't want to
[3:58:07] preach another service but today was a
[3:58:10] wonderful day how many appreciate God
[3:58:11] for that
[3:58:12] amen
[3:58:14] some of you like brother Dixon you have
[3:58:16] missed you've missed out but you can go
[3:58:17] and listen to it
[3:58:20] is that it
[3:58:25] no no no I I I wanted that one from EA
[3:58:28] him where he says now when a man is
[3:58:29] inspired and he reads the inspired word
[3:58:31] yes yes that must be from here him 1956
[3:58:35] yes so please if you want to write down
[3:58:38] write down and listen to that message
[3:58:40] but I'm having you have had you know
[3:58:42] what to do print the message and give it
[3:58:44] to the people God bless you so much
