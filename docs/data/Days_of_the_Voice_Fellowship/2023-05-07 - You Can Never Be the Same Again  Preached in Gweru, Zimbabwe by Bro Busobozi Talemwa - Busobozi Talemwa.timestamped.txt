[1:25:18] father we invite you Lord to just come
[1:25:21] now through the preaching of your word
[1:25:22] and may may we touch you may we feel
[1:25:25] your presence Lord may you do something
[1:25:28] for us by the end of this meeting Lord
[1:25:29] we just commit ourselves into your hands
[1:25:33] Lord come and take take care of the
[1:25:34] vessel Lord for we do not have any
[1:25:37] abilities of our own we need your help
[1:25:38] Lord Jesus give us enough strength
[1:25:41] father and inspiration also to speak to
[1:25:43] your children this afternoon we give you
[1:25:45] thanks Lord as we ask you these
[1:25:47] blessings in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:25:48] amen
[1:25:50] amen God bless you once again now I'm
[1:25:54] going to ask my brothers to give me a
[1:25:56] little more sound because for The Voice
[1:25:58] I've lost most of the voice
[1:26:00] a sound a man praise the name of the
[1:26:03] Lord
[1:26:04] so we are going to straight away go to
[1:26:06] the world as we are still standing
[1:26:09] and I appreciate I appreciate everything
[1:26:12] we're in the presence of God how many
[1:26:14] already the presence of God
[1:26:17] Amen from the special singers
[1:26:20] you people can really sing that's really
[1:26:22] wonderful amen it just brings down the
[1:26:25] presence of the holy spirit
[1:26:27] amen I just told the pastor that bassist
[1:26:29] is really doing Justice for the best
[1:26:31] guitar that that was really wonderful
[1:26:35] and you have a terrific song reader I
[1:26:38] mean this is just wonderful
[1:26:40] amen and my brother where is he while he
[1:26:43] was speaking I was like why doesn't he
[1:26:44] take the service
[1:26:48] you took away the tire and he brought
[1:26:51] the spare tire I don't know why but
[1:27:04] and we're reading uh only one verse and
[1:27:08] then we shall be seated
[1:27:10] now when they saw the boldness of Peter
[1:27:14] and of John and perceived that they had
[1:27:17] they were unlearned an ignorant man they
[1:27:21] marveled
[1:27:22] hmm
[1:27:23] praise the name of the Lord and they
[1:27:26] took knowledge of them that they had
[1:27:28] been with Jesus
[1:27:30] is
[1:27:51] so we just have a small thought tonight
[1:27:55] and really like her brother was speaking
[1:27:58] whenever we come in the presence of God
[1:28:02] we don't come to power a lot of
[1:28:04] scriptures and quotes to you
[1:28:07] that is not the purpose of the preaching
[1:28:10] because the courts you can read them at
[1:28:13] home
[1:28:15] the purpose of a preaching is that his
[1:28:19] presence will come and that he will meet
[1:28:21] our needs
[1:28:22] and so really if we all can be in the
[1:28:25] same Spirit
[1:28:26] it doesn't take one hour it doesn't take
[1:28:29] 20 minutes
[1:28:30] if it is five minutes and it shows up
[1:28:32] five minutes then that's all that we
[1:28:35] need in English
[1:28:36] amen amen and so a brother that spoke
[1:28:40] after the first meeting in the morning
[1:28:43] I was supposed to preach on something
[1:28:45] else this afternoon
[1:28:47] but I had this in the pipeline and I did
[1:28:49] not know exactly what the Lord wanted me
[1:28:51] to speak
[1:28:53] my brother while he was speaking
[1:28:57] you know the Holy Spirit told me exactly
[1:29:00] the words he spoke them
[1:29:03] you can never be the same again
[1:29:06] and I just picked that up
[1:29:09] I said yes Lord I'll just speaking
[1:29:12] so I'm speaking to you this afternoon
[1:29:14] you can never be the same again
[1:29:17] now I want you to notice Jesus
[1:29:20] today this weekend every Everybody all
[1:29:24] over the world
[1:29:25] they are remembering about the uh Jesus
[1:29:29] but really many of them don't even know
[1:29:32] who Jesus is
[1:29:33] but actually I want to say the bride
[1:29:36] knows who Jesus
[1:29:38] because we know just more than a man
[1:29:41] we know that he is the word we know that
[1:29:45] Jesus Christ was gone
[1:29:47] came down from Glory foreign
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:37] [Applause]
[1:30:49] are able to understand routines you see
[1:30:52] that Jesus was not just a man
[1:30:54] he was the temple of God he was the body
[1:30:58] of God he was the children place
[1:31:04] but now people can be able to worship
[1:31:07] initially they used to go to the Temple
[1:31:09] of Solomon
[1:31:10] but now the temple shifted from
[1:31:14] Solomon's Temple Solomon to the body of
[1:31:17] Jesus and I want to say the body of
[1:31:20] Jesus is here today
[1:31:21] you are the body of Jesus and you are
[1:31:25] the chosen Place
[1:31:27] Jesus Christ has chosen to be
[1:31:29] and he has chosen to dwell in us and to
[1:31:32] live in us and also Jesus Christ is here
[1:31:36] today in the form of the world
[1:31:43] of Yahweh the message
[1:31:46] is Christ did you know that
[1:31:57] this afternoon
[1:32:03] from when Jesus if you read a new if
[1:32:06] you've read the New Testament
[1:32:08] nobody ever met Jesus
[1:32:16] you can check your record again
[1:32:19] no one ever met Jesus and remained the
[1:32:24] same now we notice here the Bible Begins
[1:32:27] by saying they saw the boldness of Peter
[1:32:30] and job
[1:32:41] you have to pray for my interpreter so
[1:32:43] you can preach amen
[1:32:45] praise the Lord amen and that you also
[1:32:48] can say Amen that God will be able to
[1:32:50] come and amen do something for us you
[1:32:52] know they saw the boldness of Peter they
[1:32:56] saw the boldness of John
[1:32:57] because of the boldness
[1:33:06] [Applause]
[1:33:11] they got shocked
[1:33:14] surprise
[1:33:16] that these people at this
[1:33:19] what have they eaten who did they talk
[1:33:22] to
[1:33:23] me and soon the Bible says
[1:33:29] that these two men had been with it
[1:33:34] foreign
[1:34:11] I've never seen the man in my life
[1:34:15] what was that he was full of fear
[1:34:18] Peter was full of fear he did not know
[1:34:22] he knew what he believes
[1:34:25] that that
[1:34:27] encounter
[1:34:29] with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:31] hallelujah amen but wait until on the
[1:34:34] day of Pentecost
[1:34:37] when Peter met Jesus in that form
[1:34:40] everything changed Peter was no longer a
[1:34:44] fearful man
[1:34:48] the Bible says he became
[1:34:51] he became
[1:34:52] let me ask you the question why what
[1:34:56] made him born the people themselves gave
[1:34:58] a testimony
[1:35:00] because Peter had been with Jesus
[1:35:05] of course as I'm going through this
[1:35:07] preaching tonight I want you to
[1:35:08] understand
[1:35:09] when I said Jesus in your mind I want
[1:35:13] you to understand I'm not talking about
[1:35:16] Jesus two thousand years ago
[1:35:19] I'm talking about the Judas today
[1:35:23] I'm talking about the Holy Spirit I'm
[1:35:25] talking about the world
[1:35:31] because it's the same yesterday
[1:35:36] we find the Apostle Peter says
[1:35:39] he did not have enough education even to
[1:35:43] sign his own name
[1:35:44] Jesus gave him the keys
[1:35:48] Peter and John passing through the gates
[1:35:51] called Beautiful
[1:35:54] brother says they perceived they were
[1:35:57] ignorant and unblocked people but they
[1:36:00] took he to them
[1:36:02] knowing that they had been with Jesus
[1:36:04] and he says that is the thing we look
[1:36:07] for today
[1:36:08] is to be associated with Jesus and if
[1:36:13] you ever associate with him you will
[1:36:15] never be the same again and he says that
[1:36:18] is true you can never be the same person
[1:36:20] after once associating with Jesus
[1:36:31] before we get into the into this a
[1:36:34] little bit deeper
[1:36:36] I want us to look at this situation
[1:36:39] but when Jesus was born
[1:36:42] he went among the Jews
[1:36:44] the Jews having received him
[1:36:48] they did not believe
[1:36:50] and so because they didn't believe him
[1:36:52] he left them and went to the Gentiles
[1:36:56] now Jesus Christ has revealed himself
[1:37:00] among the Gentiles and the Jews right
[1:37:03] now are in blindness
[1:37:05] they are blinded for our sake
[1:37:08] I've met a few Jews myself
[1:37:11] I've made a few Jews
[1:37:15] said you know uh Jesus he said what who
[1:37:21] do you mind
[1:37:23] they don't even know the word Jesus
[1:37:29] they
[1:37:33] don't know
[1:37:34] it you think that they know they don't
[1:37:37] know they are blinded but look at what
[1:37:41] Jesus has done for the Gentiles
[1:37:44] our prosperity
[1:37:47] as a nation it's because of Jesus
[1:37:51] look at America America Prosper America
[1:37:55] because of Jesus as long as they worship
[1:37:59] Jesus as a nation America prospers
[1:38:05] as they are turning away from him
[1:38:08] the judgment is coming you know the cup
[1:38:12] has to be filled
[1:38:14] in order for the judgments to begin
[1:38:18] but let me tell you the Bride of Jesus
[1:38:22] will not be here
[1:38:25] when the judgments of God
[1:38:31] I am so glad I will have taken off
[1:38:34] foreign
[1:38:50] [Music]
[1:39:22] do it
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:55] because we know there is one reason why
[1:39:58] America is not attacking Russia America
[1:40:00] foreign
[1:40:31] I will see you in the Rapture because
[1:40:33] I'm not going to be here
[1:40:35] hallelujah amen during those times I'll
[1:40:40] be gone
[1:40:44] Peter and John Peter John
[1:40:47] they changed
[1:40:49] because of being with Jesus
[1:40:52] take your Bible to Acts chapter 3.
[1:41:00] verse 1. if you see a one now Peter and
[1:41:03] John went up together into the temple at
[1:41:07] The Hour of Prayer
[1:41:12] and a certain man
[1:41:14] lame from his mother's womb was courage
[1:41:20] let me first read verse by verse and a
[1:41:23] certain man who lame from his mother's
[1:41:25] womb was carried whom they laid daily at
[1:41:27] the Gate of the temple which is God
[1:41:29] beautiful to ask arms of them that
[1:41:31] entered into the temple
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:36] is beautiful
[1:41:41] who sing Peter and John about to go into
[1:41:44] the temple asked an arms and Peter
[1:41:47] fastening his eyes upon him with John
[1:41:50] said look on us
[1:41:57] praise the name of the Lord are you
[1:42:00] understanding what is is reading is that
[1:42:02] a man
[1:42:04] here is
[1:42:06] a man
[1:42:11] brother come up here is a man seated
[1:42:15] right there
[1:42:16] because he can't walk
[1:42:19] and he meets Two Gentlemen who wants to
[1:42:23] be Peter
[1:42:38] had an encounter with Jesus
[1:42:41] and the Bible says and Peter fastening
[1:42:45] his eyes upon him with John I got tied
[1:42:48] it up already they say look on us
[1:42:51] hallelujah
[1:42:53] give me the next verse
[1:43:04] he said look on us
[1:43:07] this is verse what verse five and he
[1:43:10] gave down to them
[1:43:14] expecting to receive something
[1:43:18] he was expecting to receive something
[1:43:22] this man was expecting to receive
[1:43:24] something from Buddha and John
[1:43:27] say oh you want to give me some dollars
[1:43:32] give me something
[1:43:34] then Peter
[1:43:37] Hallelujah
[1:43:41] and then Peter said
[1:43:44] amen
[1:44:05] and imagine this where Believers like
[1:44:07] you and me
[1:44:09] what happened in their lives
[1:44:15] who just believe let me tell you Peter
[1:44:19] and John we are real Believers
[1:44:21] but
[1:44:23] they didn't have the ability to do this
[1:44:32] because of the encounter of Jesus
[1:44:39] amen
[1:44:52] they met Jesus and they were never the
[1:44:55] same
[1:44:57] and
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:35] [Applause]
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:56] [Applause]
[1:46:13] what happened to him
[1:46:17] I want you to take a look at your life
[1:46:20] since you believe in the message
[1:46:25] are you the same
[1:46:28] many people can be able to look at me
[1:46:31] think about myself so you can now think
[1:46:33] about yourself as well
[1:46:35] they can be able to look at me
[1:46:37] and they can indeed know something has
[1:46:40] happened
[1:46:44] and amazement
[1:46:51] what has happened how can God do this
[1:46:55] I want to say none of those that had
[1:46:58] been with Jesus remain the same energy
[1:47:00] it is impossible to be with Jesus and
[1:47:03] you remain the same
[1:47:04] Peter who was previously fearful
[1:47:08] it's no longer the same the only thing
[1:47:11] the devil can do
[1:47:14] this
[1:47:17] the devil will try and hinder you from
[1:47:20] having an encounter with Jesus but let
[1:47:23] me tell you he can only delay
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:40] I don't care where they are born
[1:47:57] the moment that's it
[1:48:02] that seed has to be changed
[1:48:05] let me tell you the devil can only
[1:48:08] hinder
[1:48:12] some of you believe 10 years ago
[1:48:18] amen what happened the devil tried to
[1:48:22] hinder but he did not hinder
[1:48:25] hallelujah amen
[1:48:28] because you were in the mind of God you
[1:48:31] are a seed of God even the mind of God
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:44] in my hands but I will lose none of them
[1:48:51] the father can never lose me
[1:48:56] you see as I serve God as I live for God
[1:49:00] I always am conscious of that you when
[1:49:04] the devil attacks me in some ways
[1:49:06] I am always comforted
[1:49:09] by the fact that the father can never
[1:49:12] lose me
[1:49:16] he can never lose any of his own
[1:49:19] every seed that was predestinated
[1:49:22] must come in contact with him
[1:49:25] and this is exactly what I'm going to
[1:49:27] demonstrate for you in this service
[1:49:28] tonight
[1:49:30] and maybe we I don't know if all of you
[1:49:32] are believers
[1:49:33] I I don't know but I also know in a
[1:49:36] congregation like this
[1:49:38] no doubt there might be some people
[1:49:41] Seated on the fence
[1:49:44] you know what offense is
[1:49:49] how many understand what I'm talking
[1:49:50] about
[1:49:51] not inside not outside
[1:49:54] you are just there because you're born
[1:49:57] in believing homes
[1:49:59] because your fathers and mothers are
[1:50:01] believers
[1:50:02] you may be think you're a Believer like
[1:50:05] that also but God does not have
[1:50:07] grandchildren right now you must have
[1:50:10] your own encounter
[1:50:12] yourself
[1:50:32] something must happen
[1:50:34] and I want to show you tonight by the
[1:50:38] word and demonstrate it to you here
[1:50:42] and they had a change in their life
[1:50:46] the change may be negative or positive
[1:50:57] now don't get tied down again by
[1:51:00] traditions and Creeds and organizations
[1:51:04] don't be led astray by listening to
[1:51:07] those that deny the power of the world
[1:51:10] and deny that Jesus
[1:51:14] heals they deny that just filled it with
[1:51:17] the Holy ghosts
[1:51:38] now this is the the big one for me
[1:51:41] this message has enough power to save
[1:51:44] [Music]
[1:51:57] you may say why is he talking about
[1:51:59] salvation
[1:52:19] you have never been saved
[1:52:23] you must have an encounter with him
[1:52:26] whereby you have an experience
[1:52:30] you know otherwise you will be in a
[1:52:33] church and you will continue drifting in
[1:52:36] sins
[1:52:59] praise the name of the Lord
[1:53:02] so I'm telling you because I there are
[1:53:04] many people there are 10 of churches and
[1:53:08] I've never met Jesus
[1:53:10] and maybe you may be hearing me today
[1:53:13] I have good news for you today
[1:53:16] I'm not going to chase you out of church
[1:53:23] you can have an opportunity to really
[1:53:27] truly be safe
[1:53:29] you remember Brothers
[1:53:35] he was going with him now this was a
[1:53:38] prophetess son
[1:53:39] he was he even met the angel of the Lord
[1:53:44] amen but I want to tell you this boy
[1:53:48] he initially did not have an encounter
[1:53:51] with Jesus
[1:53:54] despite of all that he would still go
[1:53:58] out and try and to try a drink and and
[1:54:03] escape from home
[1:54:05] try to do his other things
[1:54:08] even try to marry an unbeliever
[1:54:12] let me tell you it takes an encounter
[1:54:15] with Jesus
[1:54:17] when you meet him
[1:54:19] changes your nature when you meet him he
[1:54:23] changes your desires
[1:54:25] who deserves your soul
[1:54:28] at the end of the day
[1:54:32] if your soul is not safe
[1:54:53] oh my God
[1:55:47] and form of Jesus Christ
[1:55:51] Google
[1:56:03] [Music]
[1:56:06] Hallelujah
[1:56:08] come on if you have had it can you put
[1:56:10] on your mouth and say I am God is free
[1:56:11] man
[1:56:14] he said we are loose by his own blood
[1:56:17] if you still hold your faith
[1:56:21] and the denominations
[1:56:24] it is certain
[1:56:26] by the evidence that you have lost your
[1:56:28] faith

[2:03:13] foreign
[2:03:28] there were a fists of the Jews
[2:03:32] and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there
[2:03:35] is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a
[2:03:38] pool which is called in Hebrew
[2:03:42] having five poachers in this layer great
[2:03:45] multitude of important Fork of blind
[2:03:49] Holt with it waiting for the moving of
[2:03:52] the water for an angel went down at a
[2:03:55] certain season into the pool and
[2:03:57] troubled the water whosoever then
[2:04:00] fast after the troubling of the water
[2:04:02] stepped in was made whole of whatever
[2:04:04] disease he had come on and a certain man
[2:04:07] was there which was which had an
[2:04:10] infirmity 30 and 80 years
[2:04:13] when Jesus saw him lie and he knew I
[2:04:17] knew that he had been now a long time in
[2:04:20] that case he said unto him will thou be
[2:04:23] made
[2:04:25] come on give me the next bus
[2:04:27] praise the name of the Lord the
[2:04:29] important man answered him sir
[2:04:32] I have no man when the water is troubled
[2:04:36] but while I am coming another step down
[2:04:40] before me come on
[2:04:43] Jesus said unto him
[2:04:45] rice
[2:04:47] and take up my bed
[2:04:51] zombie
[2:04:53] wait a moment let us understand this
[2:04:56] easy what changed
[2:04:59] this was what was happening
[2:05:02] was it the provided way of God
[2:05:12] yes it was a Revival
[2:05:17] but when Jesus comes when the the word
[2:05:21] of Yahweh comes
[2:05:23] foreign
[2:05:36] buddy I know when the angel of the Lord
[2:05:38] came to my wife you know it had to be
[2:05:41] that the first one to be thrown inside
[2:05:44] whatever disease
[2:05:53] even I believe even if he was poor you
[2:05:56] know today
[2:06:02] he did not say he did not say only
[2:06:04] diseases
[2:06:06] whatever situation
[2:06:09] as long as the angel of the Lord came
[2:06:12] and the person
[2:06:16] here when he came out
[2:06:30] lying on a palette
[2:06:34] and when Jesus came Jesus the Bible says
[2:06:37] this place had all sorts of people
[2:06:42] different man of things
[2:06:46] and this man was sick from one of them
[2:06:54] and Jesus told him would thou be made
[2:07:00] in other words I would want to call it
[2:07:03] this way when Jesus comes you're away
[2:07:05] the first thing he asked
[2:07:08] are you under expectation
[2:07:11] do you want a change
[2:07:14] he wants something to happen
[2:07:17] like the prophet of God like God spoke
[2:07:20] to the prophet of God
[2:07:27] why did God ask him you mean God did not
[2:07:31] know
[2:07:32] but he wanted foreign
[2:08:16] but these next words I love them
[2:08:20] Jesus looked at the moment
[2:08:23] and he told him
[2:08:27] rise up
[2:08:34] now I wanted to hear those words after
[2:08:37] understanding the situation of this man
[2:08:40] um
[2:08:43] [Music]
[2:08:45] does this still apply
[2:08:50] all sorts of conditions what is your
[2:08:53] condition when Jesus comes and the
[2:08:57] brother before I came here declared
[2:08:59] already that Jesus is here
[2:09:02] even the songs
[2:09:15] if what if this man said
[2:09:19] I I have been here all my life
[2:09:22] but I wanted to hear what the Monday
[2:09:25] and immediately
[2:09:28] the man was made
[2:09:31] and the two cup is
[2:09:35] and on the same day

[2:14:35] [Music]
[2:14:36] amen those in the back they do here
[2:14:39] this message
[2:14:43] it's the truth
[2:14:45] Jesus Christ came in a place where there

[2:17:21] that said well even if I don't leave my
[2:17:25] trousers

[2:18:14] foreign
[2:18:24] [Music]
[2:18:45] um
[2:18:46] only Believers of this message believe
[2:18:48] this kind of teaching
[2:18:50] attention
[2:18:54] that when things are good it doesn't
[2:18:58] mean God you know loves you so much
[2:19:01] and when they are bad it doesn't mean he
[2:19:04] has a costume

[2:19:09] we in the message
[2:19:13] they say the blessing of God you must be
[2:19:17] ready
[2:19:30] but we as Believers know there is no
[2:19:34] cast to break anything
[2:19:35] because Jesus Hallelujah when he was on
[2:19:39] the cross
[2:19:44] there is no more castles to break
[2:19:47] as long as you believe in him the
[2:19:51] castles are broken

[2:19:57] and follow us
[2:20:05] I am young

[2:21:41] it off
[2:21:42] for Jesus
[2:21:44] foreign
[2:22:07] whether I feel it or not I believe it is
[2:22:11] the word of God
[2:22:13] and now this man was like the message is
[2:22:17] complicated
[2:22:20] but he had met Jesus he
[2:22:25] said now this is hard
[2:22:28] and he was sad
[2:22:31] and he went away grieved
[2:22:35] foreign
[2:22:50] [Music]
[2:23:10] this man met Jesus he never believed did

[2:23:40] [Music]
[2:24:00] If the message is not real to you stay
[2:24:02] under the world
[2:24:03] [Music]
[2:24:05] cannot remain the same
[2:24:08] let us see one more example here
[2:24:11] hallelujah are you still listening
[2:24:15] John chapter 4 John chapter 4 verse 7
[2:24:18] verse 7.
[2:24:20] there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
[2:24:23] water
[2:24:27] give me a drink
[2:24:30] for his disciples we are gone our way
[2:24:32] into the city to buy mate
[2:24:35] I was imagining how could 12 men go
[2:24:39] about to buy meat
[2:24:40] [Music]
[2:24:44] Jesus did this on purpose
[2:24:49] he lives
[2:24:51] here hallelujah he lives
[2:24:56] he left everybody else it is
[2:25:12] so he can meet the gentlebride
[2:25:16] then saith the woman of Samaria unto him
[2:25:20] how is it that thou being a Jew asks
[2:25:24] a drink of me
[2:25:28] a woman of Samaria
[2:25:32] for the Jews have no dealings with
[2:25:34] summary
[2:25:41] is the gift of God
[2:25:49] foreign
[2:26:22] [Music]
[2:26:39] this message is disorder which Jesus has
[2:26:42] given us
[2:26:44] and we can never fast again amen amen by
[2:26:47] the water that I I shall give him shall
[2:26:50] be in him a well of water springing into
[2:26:53] everlasting life
[2:26:56] the woman answered and says I
[2:27:00] um all right but Jesus said unto her thy
[2:27:04] husband
[2:27:07] the woman answered and said I have no
[2:27:10] husbands
[2:27:13] you have well said
[2:27:15] for you have five husbands
[2:27:20] is now not thy husband
[2:27:24] and so you speak truly the woman said
[2:27:27] unto him sir I perceive the doubt
[2:27:31] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[2:27:36] in the place where men ought to worship
[2:27:39] woman
[2:27:46] believe me stand the hour coming
[2:27:49] he is a neither in the mountain no year
[2:27:52] that Jerusalem worship the father
[2:27:55] you worship you know not what
[2:27:58] do you know what we worship for
[2:28:02] salvation is of the Jews
[2:28:05] and he said but the hour comes
[2:28:08] and now he is when the true worshipers
[2:28:13] shall worship the father in spirit and
[2:28:16] in truth
[2:28:17] for the father secret search to worship
[2:28:21] God is the spirit and they that worship
[2:28:23] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[2:28:25] truth
[2:28:27] the woman said I know I want you to
[2:28:30] follow this story
[2:28:33] which is called Christ
[2:28:36] when he's come he will tell us all
[2:28:41] things amen
[2:28:43] the woman was getting somewhere
[2:28:46] she had not caught the Revelation the
[2:28:48] full Revelation
[2:28:50] she was on the right path
[2:28:52] she was realizing that this is somebody
[2:28:56] else
[2:28:59] and she was realizing
[2:29:01] that this man had spoken to her
[2:29:05] things that no money
[2:29:11] it brings things from Undercover
[2:29:14] you bring things
[2:29:17] it brings things from under cover
[2:29:23] when you sit under the preaching of the
[2:29:26] message
[2:29:27] you know the word begins to design you
[2:29:49] [Music]
[2:30:07] am I
[2:30:09] Iman
[2:30:11] I hope there is no one like that that
[2:30:14] when the word of God is
[2:30:24] the word is a designer
[2:30:27] God brings the world in such a way
[2:30:34] and Jesus said unto the woman
[2:30:38] foreign
[2:30:41] [Music]
[2:31:04] foreign
[2:31:27] as we reach the climax of the service
[2:31:29] this woman is
[2:31:32] not forgotten she was the seed of God
[2:31:37] and God knew her by name
[2:31:40] God had to dismiss all the 12 minutes
[2:31:44] [Music]
[2:31:53] and then when he went remember this was
[2:31:57] the time such women come to draw water
[2:32:01] this was not in the morning
[2:32:04] this was in the afternoon
[2:32:06] we are prostitutes I expected to be at
[2:32:10] the water
[2:32:12] they usually went to a drug lord at such
[2:32:14] time of the night of the day
[2:32:16] so when Jesus came the Bible says he had
[2:32:21] to go to Samaria
[2:32:27] why because there was a woman that
[2:32:31] needed Redemption
[2:32:35] my life can be
[2:32:46] and the woman was not minding her
[2:32:50] the woman wasn't minding him just like
[2:32:53] the nature of man in East
[2:32:55] when you see the nature of man is when
[2:32:58] you sinatasa
[2:33:00] you hide away from God
[2:33:10] they were not interested
[2:33:12] [Music]
[2:33:14] but God as a man who was rich
[2:33:17] was interested in every little thing
[2:33:21] about Adam and his foreign
[2:33:51] and this woman did not know
[2:33:53] but God knew you may not know yet
[2:33:58] your life
[2:34:00] amen at that moment when this woman
[2:34:05] heard Jesus speak
[2:34:08] when you come under the word and you
[2:34:11] hear the word this is Jesus speaking to
[2:34:14] you
[2:34:15] something was already beginning to work
[2:34:18] you know when a child of God hears the
[2:34:21] world
[2:34:24] you may not know you will not even be
[2:34:27] conscious about it
[2:34:31] and one of these days
[2:34:34] it's going to come out on the outside
[2:34:37] and something was foreign
[2:34:53] you know this was her business
[2:34:56] [Music]
[2:35:00] she came
[2:35:03] to draw water
[2:35:06] and this was a business
[2:35:08] some people come to church for other
[2:35:10] reasons
[2:35:14] you come to church for another reason
[2:35:16] but Jesus
[2:35:22] and this woman came for another purpose
[2:35:26] but when she had Jesus speak to us
[2:35:29] she threw up
[2:35:32] support
[2:35:34] she didn't care whether it bricks
[2:35:46] and the Bible says she began to run to
[2:35:50] the city
[2:35:51] she didn't walk to the city
[2:35:55] tell me what was going on
[2:35:58] she met Jesus she was never the same
[2:36:02] again
[2:36:03] she went in the city and told everybody
[2:36:12] [Music]
[2:36:14] foreign
[2:37:14] Hallelujah
[2:37:16] I'd like you to stand on your feet and
[2:37:18] hear these words
[2:37:20] it's already five and I can't continue
[2:37:26] foreign
[2:37:44] speaks from a message I just read a
[2:37:46] portion of this
[2:37:48] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:37:51] the hour is coming when this world will
[2:37:54] shake under the impact of the Church of
[2:37:55] the Living God
[2:37:59] that is moving forward in great power
[2:38:02] Guru how many believe that I'm gonna
[2:38:05] understand
[2:38:07] and Jesus says this man was possessed
[2:38:09] the devil had him all bound
[2:38:12] he's talking about the man in the terms
[2:38:16] and so the devil says I know you Jesus
[2:38:20] why do you come to torment me before my
[2:38:22] time
[2:38:27] the devil spoke right quick
[2:38:31] if you're gonna cast me let us go over
[2:38:33] into the halls
[2:38:36] and they run into those Hogs
[2:38:42] and he notes that something struck them
[2:38:44] that possessed them
[2:38:46] and they all went into the waters and
[2:38:49] drones
[2:38:50] and this man in his right mind
[2:38:54] he closed setting at the feet of Jesus
[2:38:57] Amen
[2:38:59] there you are he says that's the way you
[2:39:01] act when you come in contact with Jesus
[2:39:05] you are never the same
[2:39:10] he says religion could never be the same
[2:39:13] no one is never the same after they once
[2:39:17] met Jesus
