[24:31] is here this
[24:35] morning. Father, Lord
[24:39] Jesus, Lord, when you looked in
[24:42] eternity, you saw
[24:45] Laia. Lord, you saw me. You saw my
[24:49] brothers. You saw my
[24:51] sisters. You saw our
[24:54] weaknesses. You saw our troubles. You
[24:56] saw our
[24:58] desires. You saw how we couldn't make it
[25:02] alone. And Father, you left all the
[25:04] glory in heaven. And Lord, you came on
[25:07] Calvary and you died for us. Father, we
[25:10] want to thank you for the opportunity
[25:13] you have given us to be in your house.
[25:16] Oh Lord, we need you this
[25:19] morning. Father, many have gathered in
[25:22] this place. You said in your word that
[25:24] come unto me all year that labor and he
[25:26] have a laden. Father, you promise that
[25:30] you'll give us
[25:31] rest. Oh God, king of glory. We want to
[25:35] surrender our lives to you this morning.
[25:38] Father the men, father the women, father
[25:41] the ministers, father the song leader,
[25:44] father the the musicians, Lord, father
[25:48] our dear pastor and his family. Lord, we
[25:51] are such a feeble people. Lord, we are
[25:54] such a needy people. Oh God, as the
[25:58] prophet say that the body of Christ is
[26:00] the most sick body. Lord, you said in
[26:03] John chapter
[26:05] 15 that we oh God that we are branches
[26:10] and you are the vine and Lord you say
[26:12] that we can do nothing without you for
[26:15] sure Lord we are we're such a needy
[26:18] people that is why we have come in this
[26:20] sanctuary tonight father Lord this is
[26:23] not the social gathering father oh God I
[26:27] remember at a time Lord you gathered the
[26:29] children of Israel around Mount Siord
[26:32] Lord, and you told Moses that they
[26:34] should purify and cleanse themselves for
[26:37] your coming down. Father, this morning,
[26:39] may you cleanse us, Lord. May, oh God,
[26:42] if there is anything in our lives that
[26:44] may hinder you, oh God, from touching
[26:47] us, oh God, from receiving us, Father,
[26:51] may you forgive us,
[26:53] Lord. How we need you, Lord. The Bible
[26:57] say that your eyes are so holy that you
[27:00] cannot behold sin. And Lord, we want you
[27:03] to look at us. We want you to touch us.
[27:06] We want you to receive us. Father, if
[27:10] there is anything in our lives, in our
[27:12] families, in our pastor's life, in the
[27:15] ministers lives, Lord, this morning that
[27:18] might hinder you from visiting us.
[27:20] Father, may you look at us through the
[27:23] shed blood of Calvary. Father, where you
[27:26] shed your blood and said it is
[27:29] finished. Oh God, please cleanse us. May
[27:32] you accept a sacrifice of praise and
[27:35] worship. May you accept, Lord,
[27:38] everything that is going to be done in
[27:41] this service. May you lead the song
[27:43] leading. May you lead the preaching of
[27:46] your word. Father, we pray. Lord, I
[27:49] remember there was a brother one day. He
[27:52] was brought in your meetings. He was so
[27:55] weak that people had to force him down
[27:58] through the roof. Father, you touched
[28:01] him. Lord, I remember woman who had an
[28:04] issue of blood. She came in the service
[28:07] and she had faith that if only I could
[28:10] touch the hem of his coming. Father,
[28:12] even tonight this morning, I believe
[28:14] there is one who said, "If only I can
[28:17] touch him." Father, there was a widow of
[28:19] Zarafa. She was eating her last meal to
[28:23] die. But you're so merciful that you
[28:25] sent Elijah to pass her way. Lord, there
[28:28] are people here who are like that widow.
[28:31] They are having the last money. They're
[28:33] having the last hope. They're waiting
[28:35] for the God of Elijah to show up.
[28:38] Father, remember the blind Bmas. He was
[28:41] seated in that situation. But when you
[28:44] passed his way, Lord, the man who woke
[28:48] up blind, Lord. Oh God, the day or ended
[28:53] when he was seeing, Father, you met a
[28:56] dead young man on the gates of Oh God,
[29:00] when they were taking to bury him, Lord,
[29:03] when he met with their creator, Lord,
[29:06] you gave them back their life.
[29:09] Father, we want you to come and touch
[29:12] us. We pray for our brothers and sister
[29:15] who are on the way. Lord, may you fasten
[29:17] and quicken their feet. Lord, everybody
[29:20] that is going to be a part of this
[29:22] service, may we receive our portion. May
[29:25] you renew the backsliden, Lord. May you
[29:29] save the savable, Lord. May you heal the
[29:33] sick, Father. May you
[29:37] bless the outcasts, Lord. May you bind
[29:41] the broken hearts, Lord. May you help
[29:45] us, Lord. We need a help,
[29:50] Father. Bless us this day in the
[29:53] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[29:56] We have prayed.
[30:01] Hallelujah. Amen. In the book of Psalms
[30:05] chapter 46, the Bible
[30:08] says you have to be in the house of the
[30:10] Lord this
[30:12] morning.
[30:15] Hallelujah.
[30:17] Says, God is my God is our refuge and
[30:20] strength, a very present help in
[30:23] trouble. Therefore, we will not fear,
[30:26] though the earth be removed, and though
[30:28] the mountains be carried into the midst
[30:31] of the sea, though the waters
[30:34] roar and be troubled. Though the
[30:37] mountains shake with the swelling
[30:40] thereof, there is a river, the streams
[30:43] roar of shall make glad the city of God,
[30:46] the holy place of the tabernacles of the
[30:49] most high.
[30:51] Hallelujah. God is in the midst of her.
[30:54] She shall not be moved. God shall help
[30:57] her. Amen. On that rate, honey.
[30:59] Hallelujah. Isn't our God wonderful?
[31:03] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[31:05] Lord this morning? Amen. Just turn
[31:08] around and look to the person around
[31:10] you. Just shake their hand. Say, "God
[31:13] bless you. I welcome in the house of the
[31:15] Lord." Hallelujah.

[1:51:12] our
[1:51:14] Lord. Amen. Amen. Are we happy to be in
[1:51:18] the presence
[1:51:20] of Amen. Thank you for all the special
[1:51:24] songs and all the items. I believe the
[1:51:26] Lord is in our
[1:51:28] midst. I've been sick the whole of this
[1:51:32] week. It was announced on
[1:51:35] Wednesday. I was not able to be at
[1:51:38] church.
[1:51:40] So I want to uh uh extend my thanks to
[1:51:43] all those who cared to you know send a
[1:51:49] text you know show me some
[1:51:51] love and uh those who
[1:51:55] visited and those who sent something to
[1:51:57] you know encourage
[1:51:59] me. I was just in my bed and you know
[1:52:03] feeling bad and then uh you know someone
[1:52:05] brought a
[1:52:08] drink and he said well I'll not mention
[1:52:10] names they said it's from brother
[1:52:14] so sometimes when you feel bad and you
[1:52:17] know um the pastor comes to encourage
[1:52:20] you you feel
[1:52:24] encouraged but many times we think the
[1:52:26] pastor does not need encouragement
[1:52:31] I'm so grateful to those that really
[1:52:33] encouraged me this
[1:52:36] week. Uh it's been a trying week for me
[1:52:39] and my body. I think I was not really
[1:52:42] sick. I just broke down because of the
[1:52:44] match work that I've been
[1:52:49] doing since last
[1:52:52] year and then you know my immunity went
[1:52:55] down.
[1:52:58] So then flu came in and cough
[1:53:00] and was very weak in the
[1:53:03] body. But even this morning I'm not yet
[1:53:07] 100%. I'm so thankful to the Lord. Who
[1:53:10] cares and certainly also my wife who has
[1:53:13] always been by my side
[1:53:16] too. I was telling the boys at home, you
[1:53:19] know, she was feeding me medicine like a
[1:53:20] baby.
[1:53:26] So I say God bless you to my
[1:53:30] wife. Amen. Also I wanted to mention
[1:53:36] sister is in
[1:53:40] jail. Um I have been made to know I was
[1:53:44] not able to I got to know last
[1:53:47] night. So I was not been able to follow
[1:53:51] up. Sister, how many know
[1:53:55] sister? Um, Sister Sumpta is a very
[1:53:58] faithful member
[1:54:01] here. Um, she participates in every
[1:54:04] church
[1:54:07] activity. And so we got to learn that um
[1:54:10] I think she works in a a financial
[1:54:14] institution. So I think she was duped by
[1:54:18] uh the conmen
[1:54:22] about 1 1.5 million
[1:54:26] sheets. I don't have the details
[1:54:28] directly from her
[1:54:31] yet. So, we are going to determine that
[1:54:34] today. The deacons will determine that
[1:54:36] today after the
[1:54:38] service and then we can be able to let
[1:54:40] you know if she needs if she needs us to
[1:54:42] bail her out in any
[1:54:46] way. Also, brother Joel traveled to
[1:54:49] Arua. He sent his
[1:54:51] greetings. I'm sure he's streaming the
[1:54:55] service. We have sister Maria
[1:54:59] from Yeah. over here. God bless
[1:55:03] you. That chair is
[1:55:05] yours. Since closed
[1:55:08] here, I'm sure you'll always be
[1:55:11] blessed. Um, also I I've been informed.
[1:55:16] I don't know whether it is true that Mr.
[1:55:17] Wander is here. Is that true?
[1:55:21] Oh, right over here. God bless you so
[1:55:24] much. Amen. I think the deacons must
[1:55:27] have missed
[1:55:28] you, but we we welcome you so much. Feel
[1:55:31] at
[1:55:32] home. The children have been
[1:55:34] fellowshipping here for a long
[1:55:39] time. Is brother Neville here? Can
[1:55:41] you sister shalom? Is she here? Oh,
[1:55:44] she's lift it up
[1:55:46] high. Those are her children. So we are
[1:55:49] happy to receive you my sister. God
[1:55:51] bless you so much.
[1:55:53] Thank you to for coming to fellowship
[1:55:55] with
[1:55:56] you. Shall we go to the

[1:57:05] Psalms 34:14.
[1:57:12] Depart from evil. I will read from 14 to
[1:57:16] 19. Depart from evil and do good. Seek
[1:57:20] peace and pursue it. The eyes of the
[1:57:22] Lord are upon the righteous, and his
[1:57:24] ears are upon their cry. Open unto their
[1:57:28] cry. The face of the Lord is against
[1:57:31] them that do evil to cut off the
[1:57:33] remembrance of them from the earth. The
[1:57:35] righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and
[1:57:38] deliverth them out of their troubles.
[1:57:42] The Lord is nigh unto them that are of
[1:57:44] as a broken heart, and saveth such as be
[1:57:48] of a contrite spirit. Many are the
[1:57:51] afflictions of the righteous, but the
[1:57:52] Lord deliverth him out of them all.
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:11] number.chech.
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:43] Amen. May you may be seated.
[1:58:54] I'm requesting um as usual you please
[1:58:56] give me your undivided
[1:59:02] attention. If you have a phone, check
[1:59:05] it and make sure it is either off or in
[1:59:11] silence so that it doesn't interrupt the
[1:59:15] service. And um if you feel you will
[1:59:18] want to go out in 1 hour from
[1:59:23] now, it's better you go
[1:59:25] now. You ease yourself and come
[1:59:28] back so that we can walk together.
[1:59:35] Is that
[1:59:36] amen? So if you have a
[1:59:40] program, let's try to cut off those
[1:59:44] programs. I believe it's not a preacher
[1:59:46] going to speak to us, but the Lord going
[1:59:48] to speak to
[1:59:51] us. We ought to respect the presence of
[1:59:57] God. We have been
[1:59:59] taught in church order.
[2:00:04] the way we are supposed to conduct
[2:00:06] oursel in in in church
[2:00:09] uh you know you find people speaking to
[2:00:12] each
[2:00:14] other and you know they use WhatsApp in
[2:00:18] church you know they're texting in
[2:00:21] church those things are done in the
[2:00:26] denomination for us we don't do that
[2:00:29] here and there is also something I
[2:00:31] observed
[2:00:33] Um I've observed it for a
[2:00:35] while that usually after the service and
[2:00:38] the service is
[2:00:41] dismissed, there are people who stay in
[2:00:44] the church and they begin talking
[2:00:48] and fellowshipping and all
[2:00:51] that. And that's not
[2:00:56] right because this is a place of prayer.
[2:01:02] We have dedicated it for that
[2:01:04] purpose. So if you if the service is
[2:01:07] done and you want to talk to somebody
[2:01:10] else, we request that you please step
[2:01:13] out especially sometimes when it is
[2:01:16] raining. We find that people have stayed
[2:01:18] in
[2:01:19] here then it becomes like a
[2:01:23] market. That should never
[2:01:25] be you. If you want to talk, you just
[2:01:28] step
[2:01:29] out. There are those two rooms
[2:01:32] there. You can always have as much
[2:01:34] fellowship as you
[2:01:35] want. But in
[2:01:37] here, before the
[2:01:41] service, during the service, we expect
[2:01:44] people to either be here in the word
[2:01:46] singing, worshiping, praying or doing
[2:01:47] one of
[2:01:52] those. Also, you know, after the
[2:01:55] service, there are some young people who
[2:01:56] rush to these
[2:02:00] machines to come and practice
[2:02:03] or you are not even
[2:02:05] allowed if you're not um approved
[2:02:11] musician. You're supposed to get
[2:02:13] approval to get
[2:02:17] statement by that is serious and a
[2:02:19] serious note to the young
[2:02:23] But also you're not supposed to do it
[2:02:25] immediately after
[2:02:30] service. You know the musicians can stay
[2:02:33] there play
[2:02:35] softly so that we maintain. Sometimes
[2:02:38] after the service we have dismissed but
[2:02:39] there are people who want to stay and
[2:02:41] maybe pray a little longer.
[2:02:48] At times I've even
[2:02:51] noticed and I noticed that some sisters
[2:02:54] or brothers are in
[2:02:58] church and um they're just trying to
[2:03:01] maybe meditate or
[2:03:04] pray. A group of young people will be
[2:03:06] somewhere
[2:03:09] shouting. This person will fail to
[2:03:13] pray. It is bad. That should not
[2:03:17] happen. This is a house of
[2:03:21] prayer. I had to say that on Sunday
[2:03:24] morning so that all of us can hear
[2:03:27] that so we can ease the work of the
[2:03:32] deacons. Um also our
[2:03:37] sister, I'm not sure if they have
[2:03:39] written your name properly.
[2:03:42] Uh uh um can you lift up your hand if
[2:03:46] you God bless you. You're
[2:03:50] welcome. We happy to be with
[2:03:53] you. Amen. May the Lord bless you
[2:03:56] this. May the Lord bless you
[2:03:58] all. I just want to speak on vulnerable
[2:04:01] in his
[2:04:06] presence. We we looked at vulnerability
[2:04:09] on
[2:04:11] Sunday and we saw that it means being
[2:04:14] open about your
[2:04:19] feelings about your feelings or you you
[2:04:22] are open about your feelings or
[2:04:26] fears, your
[2:04:28] weaknesses. You do not hide them.
[2:04:31] You open yourself
[2:04:33] up to to the Lord about those
[2:04:37] weaknesses, feelings, and
[2:04:39] [Music]
[2:04:41] fears. Vulnerability means being
[2:04:46] weak. Accepting to be weak because you
[2:04:49] are
[2:04:51] weak. you know accepting you know that
[2:04:54] you're
[2:04:56] feeble, you are
[2:04:59] frail, you're not hiding
[2:05:03] it. Many times we we have a put on
[2:05:11] religion because of
[2:05:16] hypocrisy. That's the living of the
[2:05:18] Pharisees.
[2:05:20] You find that the the
[2:05:22] hypocrites they they they are not uh
[2:05:25] they're hiding their true
[2:05:27] identity and when they come to the Lord
[2:05:30] what they express is not truly what they
[2:05:32] are in in the
[2:05:35] inside. And that's why you find that
[2:05:37] many times people have dry eyed
[2:05:43] prayers, dry eyed
[2:05:46] worship, dry eyed
[2:05:50] praise. I do believe if you you you are
[2:05:52] sincere in your
[2:05:54] heart, you know you will you will show
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:05:59] emotion, you will not even intend to
[2:06:02] show
[2:06:03] it. But if it is coming from your heart,
[2:06:06] You cannot hide
[2:06:08] it. It's just like someone I remember
[2:06:11] those days when we was just starting out
[2:06:13] our relationship with my
[2:06:17] wife. You know, you would um one time,
[2:06:19] you know, we're talking and I told her
[2:06:21] how much I loved
[2:06:23] her and the feeling was so real.
[2:06:28] that that experience was so
[2:06:33] tangible that it made me cry. And she
[2:06:37] said, "Dear, we were both on
[2:06:39] phone just about a month or three away
[2:06:42] from to our
[2:06:45] wedding. I could be wrong with the
[2:06:47] dates, but anyway." And you know, as as
[2:06:51] we were talking, she said, "Are you
[2:06:52] crying?"
[2:06:54] I said, "No, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
[2:06:58] you know because I wanted to hide my
[2:06:59] frailty my my
[2:07:02] weakness and many of us are like
[2:07:04] that we want to hide our
[2:07:07] weakness we want to hide our fe our
[2:07:10] feelings we don't we we are not sure how
[2:07:13] the other party or the other person will
[2:07:15] treat us if they know we are
[2:07:19] weak and we we often do that to each
[2:07:23] other but if you are sincere in your
[2:07:26] relationship in the
[2:07:28] feeling. You will express
[2:07:31] it. Just like a a young man that I was,
[2:07:35] how I was able to express my
[2:07:37] feelings. It's not much. It's just
[2:07:40] love. But love would make someone
[2:07:43] cry a man. Can you imagine that? It is
[2:07:48] true. It is possible. Maybe it has made
[2:07:51] some of you
[2:07:53] cry. Simply because of love.
[2:07:56] How many have you ever cried because of
[2:07:58] that? Well, well, of course you you you
[2:08:02] are hiding
[2:08:03] it. You don't want your weakness to be
[2:08:06] known. But you see, you have to accept
[2:08:09] to be
[2:08:11] vulnerable when it comes to
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:15] God. Many of us, we hide our
[2:08:20] vulnerability. You find that someone is
[2:08:22] in church and they're
[2:08:24] praying but you see the their words are
[2:08:27] many
[2:08:28] words but those words have not touched
[2:08:33] it. They cannot touch
[2:08:36] God. Many of our prayers go
[2:08:39] unanswered because we are not accepting
[2:08:43] vulnerability. We are hypocrite. We
[2:08:46] don't want to show our weakness.
[2:08:49] You see, God is not in interested in
[2:08:51] your
[2:08:53] strength. Listen to this. God is even
[2:08:56] not interested in your
[2:08:59] perfection. God is not looking for a
[2:09:01] perfect person, a perfect woman, a
[2:09:05] man. God is interested in a weak woman,
[2:09:08] a weak
[2:09:10] man. God is interested in someone who
[2:09:13] can show their frame.
[2:09:18] That is what he calls a broken
[2:09:21] heart. That's what he calls a contrite
[2:09:25] spirit. Many times we think that God
[2:09:27] will accept us because we we have done
[2:09:30] everything
[2:09:33] perfect because we have lived
[2:09:36] right because we have you know you know
[2:09:39] when you come to pray and then the devil
[2:09:41] brings you to your remembrance
[2:09:43] everything that you did that was bad.
[2:09:46] Then you hold back your prayer. You be
[2:09:48] like the Lord can see that I am a
[2:09:52] sinner. And then you feel like you can't
[2:09:54] even
[2:09:55] pray. Some even fail or fear to come to
[2:09:59] church because of their sin. Why?
[2:10:03] Because they don't they want to hide
[2:10:04] their
[2:10:05] weakness. But let me tell you, the best
[2:10:08] time for you to experience the presence
[2:10:10] of
[2:10:12] God is when you are weak.
[2:10:15] When you you feel weak, when you you
[2:10:18] have a lot of
[2:10:19] fear, that is the right moment for you
[2:10:23] to experience his
[2:10:25] presence. Then come and when you come,
[2:10:29] don't even pay attention to the other
[2:10:31] voices you are
[2:10:33] hearing. God is interested in your weak
[2:10:38] situation. God is interested in your in
[2:10:41] your feeance.
[2:10:45] He is interested in your
[2:10:47] failures, in your fears. He has interest
[2:10:51] in your small
[2:10:53] things. When you come break down in your
[2:10:57] heart, that means you have a broken
[2:11:00] heart. That means you have a contrite
[2:11:03] spirit. Don't come here and try to
[2:11:07] pretend. You see that is a
[2:11:09] Pharisee. You see, he says a Pharisee.
[2:11:12] What does he
[2:11:13] do? He says when we pray, we should not
[2:11:16] pray like the
[2:11:17] Pharisees. They go to the tabernacle to
[2:11:20] the
[2:11:20] temple. They lift up holy hands. Begin
[2:11:24] repeating words. Oh Lord, you are
[2:11:27] powerful. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you
[2:11:29] Jesus.
[2:11:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:11:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you,
[2:11:39] Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh, you're wonderful.
[2:11:44] is that prayer that doesn't move
[2:11:48] God. When you come before God, you have
[2:11:52] to first of all accept your frailty,
[2:11:53] your weakness, your
[2:11:58] fee. You have to express it. If you hide
[2:12:02] it, you will not be
[2:12:05] accepted. But if you express it, God
[2:12:08] will be interested in you.
[2:12:11] because he's a helper to those who are
[2:12:15] helpless. Amen. He's a strength.
[2:12:20] Amen. He understands when nobody
[2:12:23] understands. We should never hide our
[2:12:27] heart from our
[2:12:29] savior. He's the savior of our souls.
[2:12:33] You know, we have a song which says he's
[2:12:34] a savior of my
[2:12:37] soul. When you come to him, the Bible
[2:12:40] says when you come to him, you must
[2:12:42] believe that he is and he is a
[2:12:47] rewarder for all those that diligently
[2:12:50] seek
[2:12:52] him. So when you come, understand that
[2:12:56] have that
[2:12:58] mentality and then be ready to tell him
[2:13:01] how weak you are, how bad you are, our
[2:13:06] sin, then he will embrace it. Amen.
[2:13:10] Amen. Imagine that prodigal son if he
[2:13:13] had come back to his father. Amen. And
[2:13:16] you know maybe he had borrowed some
[2:13:18] clothes and a heart. Of course, you
[2:13:21] know, he was eating with a
[2:13:23] pig. But now out of that
[2:13:26] situation, you know, he would maybe say,
[2:13:28] "Let me go check on my dad." And then
[2:13:31] borrow a suit and borrow a cake and then
[2:13:34] go to his father and tell him, "Daddy,
[2:13:38] how are you doing? I just came to check
[2:13:40] on you. You know, you gave me my portion
[2:13:43] and I'm doing well, daddy. But I just
[2:13:46] came to check on you. What do you think
[2:13:48] would have
[2:13:49] happened?" his father would have ignored
[2:13:53] him because he would he would know that
[2:13:55] is a
[2:13:56] rascal. He he he's doing well. He says
[2:13:59] he's doing well. It's all right. If he's
[2:14:02] doing well, it's all right. And then he
[2:14:04] would have concentrated on the other
[2:14:07] sons. But when this boy came even in
[2:14:11] [Music]
[2:14:12] rats from feeding
[2:14:15] pigs and he came before the father he
[2:14:19] never hid his
[2:14:21] situation. He came the way he was. He
[2:14:25] told him, "Father, I don't even want to
[2:14:27] call you father. I am unworthy because
[2:14:31] of the kind of life I have
[2:14:33] been. I am a sinner. I am unworthy to be
[2:14:37] called your
[2:14:38] son. At least receive me as your
[2:14:42] servant."
[2:14:43] But when the father saw, when he saw
[2:14:47] brokenness, when he saw the
[2:14:49] vulnerability in this boy's life, he
[2:14:52] said, "I can never receive you as a
[2:14:56] servant. My blood is flowing through
[2:14:59] your
[2:15:00] veins." Amen. And he shouted, he said,
[2:15:03] "Help people. Kill the
[2:15:06] fat." Amen. and bring me a robe. Bring
[2:15:10] me a
[2:15:11] ring and for my
[2:15:16] son. Let us have a party. Amen. Amen. He
[2:15:20] would give him a new garment. He give
[2:15:23] him a new ring. He will receive him and
[2:15:26] hug him. That is our heavenly
[2:15:30] father. The Bible say he can be touched
[2:15:34] by the feelings of our infirmities.
[2:15:38] He did not come for the
[2:15:40] perfect. He came for the sinners. He did
[2:15:43] not come for the for the know it
[2:15:46] all. He came for the weak
[2:15:49] ones. Actually in in the New
[2:15:51] Testament. He says that he left the wise
[2:15:54] and the prudent of the
[2:15:56] world and he came for the foolish the fe
[2:16:00] the small things of the world such as
[2:16:02] can
[2:16:04] learn. Amen.
[2:16:07] Amen. I'm willing to
[2:16:09] learn. And brother in the message
[2:16:11] questions and
[2:16:13] answers and I read this last Sunday. He
[2:16:17] says, "Wouldn't you all like to have a
[2:16:18] real Bible
[2:16:22] church, a real Bible church where all
[2:16:25] the spiritual gifts are set in
[2:16:28] order, everything making manifest just
[2:16:31] exactly the way it should be."
[2:16:34] And he says, "Wouldn't that be
[2:16:36] wonderful?" Now, you are going to have a
[2:16:40] sacrifice. You have to have a sacrifice
[2:16:43] to have a real Bible
[2:16:45] church. Is that
[2:16:47] amen? And he says the sacrifice is not
[2:16:51] money. Money has its
[2:16:54] place. It's not money that makes a real
[2:16:56] Bible church.
[2:16:59] What are you going to
[2:17:00] sacrifice? He says some of your ideas.
[2:17:05] And he says you are going to have to
[2:17:06] sacrifice some time in
[2:17:10] prayer. You are going to have to
[2:17:12] sacrifice maybe that stubborn
[2:17:18] will. Some of you are have stubborn
[2:17:23] wills. When God talks to
[2:17:26] you, you just say even if God said
[2:17:30] this but the moment you say but it means
[2:17:35] you have your own
[2:17:37] will. We must never have a
[2:17:40] but after saying the
[2:17:42] word. You can never say God says this
[2:17:47] but a believer should never have that in
[2:17:50] their
[2:17:51] mouth. You just say God says that
[2:17:54] And that settles it for me. I believe
[2:17:58] it. Amen. And so we see here many of us
[2:18:02] have a stubborn
[2:18:04] will. He says, but he says you have to
[2:18:07] sacrifice your stubborn
[2:18:09] will. And then you break down in
[2:18:14] humility. You see the whole Christian
[2:18:17] move is sacrificial.
[2:18:21] He that will follow me, let him deny
[2:18:25] himself, let him take up his cross and
[2:18:29] follow me
[2:18:31] daily. Each of us have our own cross to
[2:18:36] carry. And our cross is not the
[2:18:39] same. The weight is not the
[2:18:42] same because our strength is not the
[2:18:45] same or rather should I say our weakness
[2:18:47] is not the same.
[2:18:50] So then each of us have our own
[2:18:52] crossing. But then he said if you want
[2:18:55] to follow
[2:18:56] him first deny
[2:19:00] yourself. Second carry your
[2:19:05] cross. Follow
[2:19:07] him. How often do you have to
[2:19:11] sacrifice? Every day. We have to
[2:19:14] sacrifice every
[2:19:15] day. Paul said he died daily.
[2:19:20] May we also come to that place where we
[2:19:23] have to sacrifice our stubborn
[2:19:26] will except to break down in
[2:19:29] humility and we sacrifice some time in
[2:19:32] prayer.
[2:19:35] I quite frankly I believe that after
[2:19:38] this um
[2:19:40] subject those who have been
[2:19:43] listening like following it very
[2:19:46] well God will do something for
[2:19:50] you. So we see that um many people are
[2:19:55] stubborn and on Sunday we spoke about
[2:19:59] Saul how Saul was very
[2:20:02] stubborn. God spoke to Saul many times,
[2:20:06] but Saul many times disobeyed
[2:20:10] God. He never listened to what God
[2:20:13] said. He had his
[2:20:16] opinion. When you come to God, are you
[2:20:19] hearing me? When you come to God, you
[2:20:22] have no
[2:20:24] opinion. Tell your neighbor, your
[2:20:27] opinion doesn't
[2:20:30] matter. God is not looking for your
[2:20:32] opinion.
[2:20:34] God is looking for his
[2:20:36] word. God is looking for your
[2:20:38] faith in what he has said because he has
[2:20:42] not brought his word to debate with
[2:20:46] you. He has brought his word to make his
[2:20:49] word accomplish the
[2:20:53] purpose. So if God said in his
[2:20:55] word he's coming back for a
[2:20:58] church that is perfect without spot
[2:21:02] without wrinkle and I believe I'm
[2:21:05] that I believe I must be without spot I
[2:21:09] must be without wrinkle no matter what I
[2:21:12] see around me I am going to die
[2:21:15] daily I'm going to carry my cross daily
[2:21:19] I'm going to deny myself daily until I
[2:21:22] become what
[2:21:26] Now that is
[2:21:27] faith and you can't do that without
[2:21:30] being
[2:21:31] vulnerable. Every day you are going to
[2:21:35] realize you are
[2:21:36] vulnerable because whenever you see what
[2:21:39] God said about
[2:21:41] you, you don't see it in you. So then
[2:21:44] you become vulnerable. Then you cry. All
[2:21:48] great men were vulnerable.
[2:21:51] They always saw
[2:21:53] weakness. They always saw you know um
[2:21:57] fee. But you see God so
[2:22:00] strength, God so
[2:22:02] power. Let the weak
[2:22:05] say that's how it has to be done. How
[2:22:09] can it be if we are so
[2:22:12] self-centered,
[2:22:15] self-righteous and you know you cannot
[2:22:17] break down in his
[2:22:19] word and you are hiding your true
[2:22:21] identity from
[2:22:23] God. Brethren, we should stop having
[2:22:27] religion and we should be
[2:22:30] Christian. Religion will hide
[2:22:34] identity. Religion will be
[2:22:35] selfrighteous.
[2:22:38] But true
[2:22:39] Christianity will be feeble and
[2:22:42] weak and they will be reliant on
[2:22:46] God. Many times you want to show it as
[2:22:49] if believers are perfect
[2:22:54] people. Now I'm I'm sorry if I step on
[2:22:57] some
[2:22:58] toys, but I want to tell you all of you
[2:23:01] who are hearing
[2:23:02] me, you are not perfect.
[2:23:07] In that
[2:23:09] sense, we are all weak.
[2:23:14] So if an unbeliever comes
[2:23:17] in looking for uh
[2:23:21] Christians, he was told Christians are
[2:23:24] people who are
[2:23:25] changed and perfect without spirit,
[2:23:29] without he comes among you. If you do
[2:23:33] not accept
[2:23:35] vulnerability, that man or woman will be
[2:23:39] offended. They will walk away. They will
[2:23:42] say after all, they are sinners
[2:23:44] also. That's why they say touch people.
[2:23:47] Oh, they are the worst
[2:23:49] ones. Do you know why? Let me tell you
[2:23:52] something. We are not perfect, but we
[2:23:55] are not better than
[2:23:57] them. There is something I'm trying to
[2:23:59] preach.
[2:24:01] We are not better than other people who
[2:24:03] are in the
[2:24:04] world meaning that the things they are
[2:24:06] going
[2:24:07] through. We are going
[2:24:09] through the weaknesses they have. We
[2:24:13] have
[2:24:15] the failures they go through. We go
[2:24:17] through the temptations they
[2:24:20] have. We have.
[2:24:23] So if they come to
[2:24:25] us, if they come to you, do not try to
[2:24:29] show
[2:24:30] them that you are a super human
[2:24:35] being. There is no super human
[2:24:40] being. All human beings are the
[2:24:43] same. Muslim, Catholic,
[2:24:47] Anglican, they are all the
[2:24:50] same. Same And when they die, they all
[2:24:55] die and they all buried in the
[2:24:59] soul. And even if you refuse to cry, you
[2:25:03] also feel the pain the other unbelievers
[2:25:06] feel. That's why when Lazarus
[2:25:09] died, Jesus did not
[2:25:12] pretend. Like some believers who pretend
[2:25:15] me not cry because I'm a
[2:25:18] believer. Jesus did not pretend.
[2:25:22] He
[2:25:29] weptus the one we worship he did not
[2:25:32] pretend because he was a human being
[2:25:37] like now but the difference between us
[2:25:40] and
[2:25:41] them is that they accept their
[2:25:46] weakness. They know their weakness but
[2:25:49] they don't know a savior.
[2:25:52] Hallelujah. So when they have
[2:25:55] problem, they cry to one another and
[2:25:58] then they bewitch one
[2:26:00] another. You know, I have a problem in
[2:26:02] my
[2:26:03] marriage. Oh, don't worry. Don't worry,
[2:26:05] my friend. Don't worry, my friend. And
[2:26:08] then I'll take it to
[2:26:10] a this one who is helping them will be
[2:26:16] her. They wish one
[2:26:18] another. They betray one
[2:26:21] another. Don't tell me. Don't tell them
[2:26:23] who told
[2:26:24] you.
[2:26:26] See, you think they
[2:26:29] happen
[2:26:30] problems. I know everything. But don't
[2:26:33] don't
[2:26:34] say. And then when they go back, my
[2:26:37] friend, I'm always there for
[2:26:40] you. They trust in each
[2:26:43] other. The more they trust each other,
[2:26:45] the more they betray each other.
[2:26:47] That's why when you hear people speaking
[2:26:49] things like human beings are
[2:26:54] beasts. It is because they have been
[2:26:56] disappointed before by another human
[2:26:59] being. They trusted in human
[2:27:02] beings. You hear them speak all sorts of
[2:27:05] things about
[2:27:06] people. To me I don't trust people.
[2:27:09] people these
[2:27:10] people that's all true but that talk
[2:27:13] should be in the
[2:27:14] world because for them they have no
[2:27:17] savior when they have problem they run
[2:27:20] to each other they run to which doctor
[2:27:23] they run to doctors they run to
[2:27:26] psychiatrist they run to this and that
[2:27:29] but
[2:27:31] Christian true message
[2:27:34] believers when we are
[2:27:36] vulnerable hallelujah I said hallelujah.
[2:27:40] Hallelujah. We have a savior.
[2:27:44] We have a savior.
[2:27:46] And one who truly
[2:27:48] understand because he has experienced we
[2:27:52] have experienced.
[2:27:54] [Applause]
[2:27:56] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. The Bible say in
[2:28:00] all manner of temptations we go through
[2:28:03] he has gone
[2:28:05] through. And when I tell you that Jesus
[2:28:08] understands, believe
[2:28:11] me. Amen. That's why when you have a
[2:28:14] problem, when you have a weakness or if
[2:28:17] you have a sin that easily be saved,
[2:28:20] brethren, let me tell you, let us always
[2:28:23] run to the
[2:28:25] savior because he always
[2:28:28] understand. He knows what you're going
[2:28:30] through. He knows your weakness. He
[2:28:33] knows your suffering. He knows your
[2:28:36] pain. He understands your
[2:28:39] heart. He has gone through it before and
[2:28:42] is the savior of our
[2:28:45] soul. You do well to trust
[2:28:49] him. So when they come to us, let us be
[2:28:53] truthful. Let us tell them, look, I'm as
[2:28:57] weak as you, but I have something you
[2:29:00] don't like. I have a savior.
[2:29:04] One who keeps me when the whole world is
[2:29:07] breaking
[2:29:08] apart. One who holds me when I have no
[2:29:12] hope. One who encourages me. When I've
[2:29:15] lost
[2:29:16] everything. Amen. When I've had a
[2:29:19] heartbreak, he comforts my soul. Amen.
[2:29:22] Music can try but he cannot do
[2:29:26] it. My friend can try but he can't do
[2:29:29] it. But heus Christ. Amen. He comforts
[2:29:34] my soul. He restoreth my
[2:29:37] soul. Amen. That's what a savior is.
[2:29:43] But the issue is many believers are
[2:29:47] hypocrites. They do not accept to be
[2:29:51] vowed before the
[2:29:53] Lord. You see, you find that we are not
[2:29:58] sincere. Saul was not vulnerable.
[2:30:03] He offered the offerings he was not
[2:30:06] allowed to do that. But what happened?
[2:30:09] He did it anyhow. And when the priest
[2:30:11] came
[2:30:12] when he did not give, you know, like
[2:30:15] care that much, he said, "I did it
[2:30:18] because people were going
[2:30:19] away." And and you know, he was
[2:30:22] rebuked and God took away the
[2:30:25] kingdom. God took away the
[2:30:27] kingdom. Can you imagine? We talked
[2:30:30] about that on Sunday. But then let's
[2:30:32] move on. You see, when God took away the
[2:30:36] kingdom, he gives it to another
[2:30:38] man. Now listen close. He doesn't give
[2:30:42] the kingdom to another
[2:30:45] angel. He gave it to
[2:30:48] another. What's the difference between
[2:30:51] this other
[2:30:53] man and
[2:30:55] this 1 Samuel 13:40?
[2:30:59] But now the kingdom shall not
[2:31:02] continue. The Lord assought him a
[2:31:06] man. Now here is the
[2:31:09] difference. The Lord
[2:31:13] ass his own
[2:31:17] heart. So the difference was that this
[2:31:21] man had a heart like that of God.
[2:31:28] So he had a different
[2:31:30] heart. Oh, David was called a man after
[2:31:33] God's own
[2:31:35] heart because he was
[2:31:39] passed. Hallelujah. But because he
[2:31:43] always
[2:31:45] always was
[2:31:47] vulnerable and
[2:31:49] honest before
[2:31:52] God. So when he came to God, he told God
[2:31:56] what he truly
[2:31:58] felt. You know, he did things worse than
[2:32:00] what Saul
[2:32:02] did. Saul only exercised authority here
[2:32:05] and
[2:32:06] there. He was only a proud
[2:32:09] man. The biggest sin Saul had was pride.
[2:32:18] And the Bible says pride comes before
[2:32:20] the fall.
[2:32:23] But we see David had multiple
[2:32:28] sins. He was an
[2:32:30] adulterer, a lustful
[2:32:32] man. He was a murderer. A
[2:32:38] murderer. But God says he's a man after
[2:32:45] man. Is there last murder and immorality
[2:32:48] in God?
[2:32:54] No, he did not. God doesn't. So what's
[2:32:58] the difference? Why is David a man after
[2:33:01] God's
[2:33:02] heart? Because no matter his
[2:33:06] weakness, he always was
[2:33:09] vulnerable. He accepted. He never hid
[2:33:13] from the presence of
[2:33:15] God. He came to God and he expressed how
[2:33:18] he was.
[2:33:20] When he sinned, he came to
[2:33:22] God to you. To you only have I sinned.
[2:33:28] Wash
[2:33:30] me. P me
[2:33:33] with Let me tell you, David came to God
[2:33:39] openhearted, a broken
[2:33:42] heart, that is a heart like
[2:33:47] unto but pride
[2:33:49] is a heart of
[2:33:52] Satan. But brokenness,
[2:33:56] humility is a heart like unto the Lord.
[2:34:01] This man will I
[2:34:03] look, a man who has a a broken
[2:34:06] heart and a contrite
[2:34:10] spirit, a teachable
[2:34:13] spirit. Sometimes you correct
[2:34:17] somebody they pull their nose and they
[2:34:20] walk
[2:34:22] away that kind of
[2:34:24] heart God can never accept.
[2:34:28] Sometimes you can even preach the
[2:34:30] word a preacher you can see we have
[2:34:33] visitors here
[2:34:34] sometimes and you know you know the
[2:34:37] people and the word will be preached and
[2:34:41] you'll be like ah sister so and so
[2:34:44] brother so and so I'm sure this is his
[2:34:48] son but you turn look at him as a pastor
[2:34:52] like they have missed
[2:34:55] it and yet they were in the
[2:34:58] service. What happened? What went wrong?
[2:35:01] They have a hard
[2:35:03] heart. They don't want to be
[2:35:05] corrected. Instead of say, "Oh, God is
[2:35:07] speaking
[2:35:08] about they are the ones who say pastor
[2:35:12] must have told
[2:35:14] this. I think this church
[2:35:17] has even the preacher talked about my
[2:35:21] case and I had told it to only one
[2:35:24] person."
[2:35:27] Come on. Come on. Do we believe in
[2:35:30] God? Let me tell you, God
[2:35:34] speaks. When God
[2:35:37] speaks, always receive
[2:35:39] it. Whether it is coming from
[2:35:43] inspiration, let me tell you, you can
[2:35:45] even tell me about your
[2:35:47] case. And I know what you're going
[2:35:50] through. as an individual. You have told
[2:35:53] me as your
[2:35:54] person, I will never talk about it here.
[2:35:58] But if the Lord inspires me, I can come
[2:36:01] and
[2:36:02] bless. I'm blessed you about it. And
[2:36:05] like
[2:36:06] pastor, I told him my case for him to
[2:36:10] bless
[2:36:11] me. Not because I wanted that was
[2:36:15] inspiration for that
[2:36:17] moment, for that moment. Always have a
[2:36:20] broken
[2:36:21] heart. Don't be
[2:36:24] hard-hearted. Have a contrite spirit.
[2:36:27] Always be ready and willing to hear from
[2:36:30] God. Am I preaching to someone this
[2:36:33] morning? Amen. Have a vulnerable uh
[2:36:38] heart. Be vulnerable in his presence.
[2:36:42] In many
[2:36:43] psalms, David expressed
[2:36:46] fear,
[2:36:48] failure,
[2:36:50] guilt, long a
[2:36:53] longing. He hide, he hided or he hid
[2:36:56] nothing from God.
[2:37:01] Now on Sunday, I read you the story of
[2:37:05] of of brother
[2:37:08] Brham on uh on how God broke
[2:37:12] him. I said if you refuse to to break,
[2:37:15] God can break
[2:37:18] you. If he speaks to you and you refuse
[2:37:21] to break, he can allow things to come
[2:37:23] and break
[2:37:24] you. And and here is
[2:37:27] another portion of his
[2:37:31] testimony. To those of you who love
[2:37:33] stories, you can take a minute or two to
[2:37:36] listen to this
[2:37:37] one. I notice children love
[2:37:41] stories. You can preach for two
[2:37:44] hours and they will only remember the
[2:37:47] story. Praise
[2:37:49] God. Anyways, listen to this little
[2:37:52] story. that I could see my wife
[2:37:56] going, but I couldn't see that baby
[2:38:00] going. You know, he had seen that his
[2:38:02] wife would
[2:38:03] die, but it never occurred to him that
[2:38:05] even his baby would
[2:38:07] die. So, I just couldn't do it. And I
[2:38:09] said, "Oh,
[2:38:11] God, why did you take that precious
[2:38:14] little thing from
[2:38:16] me?" Something has happened to you and
[2:38:18] you asking God, "Why?
[2:38:20] Why? What is breaking you?
[2:38:24] Here I am. And God only breaks those who
[2:38:27] he is interested
[2:38:30] in. If you have a purpose to hit and you
[2:38:34] are
[2:38:35] proud, God can allow things to come and
[2:38:37] they will break
[2:38:42] you. So you see here he says he's crying
[2:38:45] to God. born. Why did you take that
[2:38:49] precious little thing for
[2:38:51] me? Here I am left alone in the
[2:38:55] world. Me and the boy to wander around
[2:38:59] together. I said why did you take her
[2:39:02] Lord? I got so worked
[2:39:06] up till I said Sherry
[2:39:09] honey that is coming to you this this
[2:39:12] morning. And he's talking to Sharon
[2:39:14] little Sharon who had died.
[2:39:17] and saying that is coming to
[2:39:20] you. Brother, what are you trying to
[2:39:24] do? Let us find out. I pulled off my
[2:39:28] rubber
[2:39:30] glove. Brother Brham was a man who
[2:39:33] worked on electricity
[2:39:36] poles. That was his profession.
[2:39:41] And so he he is now on the on the pole
[2:39:45] up
[2:39:46] there and he pulls off the glove the
[2:39:49] rubber
[2:39:49] glove after saying sh honey daddy is
[2:39:53] coming to you this
[2:39:55] morning is a broken
[2:39:58] man and he pulls off the glove there
[2:40:02] 2300 running right by
[2:40:06] me. It will break every bone in your
[2:40:08] body.
[2:40:11] I had gone crazy. I pulled my glove. I
[2:40:15] said,
[2:40:18] "Sh, I can't stay away from you
[2:40:20] anymore." I said,
[2:40:22] "Go. I had to be a
[2:40:25] coward. But I can't stand it. My heart
[2:40:29] is
[2:40:30] breaking." That's where God wants
[2:40:33] you. And the word this morning can bring
[2:40:37] you in that state.
[2:40:39] But if you it
[2:40:40] doesn't God has a purpose for your
[2:40:43] life. Situations will bring
[2:40:47] you just listen to the word. I let the
[2:40:50] word
[2:40:51] break my heart is breaking. I can't
[2:40:55] stand it. The next thing I knew, of
[2:40:59] course, he just
[2:41:00] went and the next thing he knew, I was
[2:41:03] sitting on the ground.
[2:41:05] [Laughter]
[2:41:10] How did he fall down? Sitting on the
[2:41:13] ground. How I ever got down from there?
[2:41:15] God
[2:41:17] only. I believe. I believe. This is my
[2:41:22] belief. Let me tell you what I believe.
[2:41:25] By inspiration. I believe God must have
[2:41:28] dispassed an
[2:41:31] angel. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:41:33] Yes, sir. Come on. Go down.
[2:41:36] This is a prophet to the
[2:41:39] church. He must not die
[2:41:42] now. Carry him and take him to the
[2:41:46] ground. And the angel must have gone
[2:41:55] with
[2:41:58] sleep. And then he woke up. How' they
[2:42:00] get
[2:42:01] here? He didn't say even power had
[2:42:03] shocked him. Now
[2:42:06] The same angel that was in that burning
[2:42:10] bush must have gone at a
[2:42:12] place. There might have been many times
[2:42:16] when you have wanted to
[2:42:17] die. Why are you not
[2:42:20] dead? Because there is a purpose in
[2:42:24] you. God is not done with you
[2:42:27] yet. You wanted to die because you were
[2:42:31] broken. God wanted you broken.
[2:42:34] to prepare you for your next
[2:42:37] phase. Many times we are all
[2:42:40] broken because God wants to use us
[2:42:44] because God wants to say, "See a man,
[2:42:47] see a
[2:42:48] woman, my
[2:42:52] owner." And brother Bam, the angel put
[2:42:54] him
[2:42:55] down. He only realized when he was done.
[2:42:59] And I
[2:43:01] believe now he also says what he
[2:43:03] believed.
[2:43:06] He said, "I believe if that gift hadn't
[2:43:10] been for ordained and put in
[2:43:15] there, I would have been gone right
[2:43:20] there cuz I made up my mind. I was going
[2:43:24] to take my life in a suicide
[2:43:28] case. I remember one time when we had
[2:43:32] just moved here
[2:43:34] uh when we were just about to move.
[2:43:36] Sorry. I was looking for a house. And I
[2:43:40] was driving I was in my first car. So I
[2:43:42] was driving the other
[2:43:43] side. It's a good nice you know
[2:43:47] Highlander having good ground
[2:43:50] clearance meaning like it was a little
[2:43:53] high. So so and it was new good
[2:43:58] tires. So that I don't know if that is
[2:44:01] what helped me. But here is what
[2:44:03] happened. I was driving, my glasses were
[2:44:06] up, window glasses and then all of a
[2:44:09] sudden I heard people
[2:44:10] shouting and the moment they started
[2:44:13] shouting. I I started dancing and I was
[2:44:16] driving. So I was wondering where am I
[2:44:18] dancing? Why am I dancing? So as I drove
[2:44:22] I said let me stop and see where they
[2:44:24] are.
[2:44:25] When I went back, I saw a threephase
[2:44:31] line on the floor on the
[2:44:35] road. I just drove over
[2:44:39] it. That's why I was
[2:44:41] dancing. It was the effect of
[2:44:46] electricity. I said I should have
[2:44:49] died. The devil wanted to finish me
[2:44:51] right
[2:44:52] there. But the angel of the Lord was
[2:44:55] He was right there. My work was not
[2:44:59] done. You cannot die. Until your work is
[2:45:04] done until your assignment
[2:45:08] done. I speak to you. The name of the
[2:45:10] Lord
[2:45:11] is all of you under the sound of my
[2:45:13] voice. You cannot
[2:45:16] die. God's purpose
[2:45:19] is God has an assignment for you.
[2:45:23] work for you to
[2:45:25] do. Amen. You can fasten that
[2:45:29] work by breaking
[2:45:33] down in his presence and being
[2:45:37] vulnerable. And he says, I believe if
[2:45:39] that gift will not was not ordained and
[2:45:41] put in
[2:45:43] there, I have been gone right there
[2:45:46] because I made up my mind. I was going
[2:45:49] to take my life as a suicide case. I'd
[2:45:53] lost my mind. I've had gone crazy. I
[2:45:57] went home. I said, "Oh, I put my tools
[2:46:00] in the car. I said, I'm going home. I've
[2:46:04] gone
[2:46:07] crazy."
[2:46:08] Sometimes God wants you to get to that
[2:46:11] time when you feel you're losing your
[2:46:14] mind. When our back was against the
[2:46:17] wall,
[2:46:20] and you feel as if it's
[2:46:23] all then he makes a way.
[2:46:28] Amen. Hallelujah. Why does he
[2:46:32] watch until things become
[2:46:37] ugly? Because he wants to come in when
[2:46:40] you have
[2:46:44] broken when you you are vulnerable.
[2:46:48] Let me show you after
[2:46:50] that what happened in life in the
[2:46:54] beginning of Jesus's fame. That is the
[2:46:56] message in
[2:46:58] 1953. I want to show you when you are
[2:47:01] broken then you will always submit to
[2:47:03] his
[2:47:05] word. So I want you to see it's just a
[2:47:08] small portion here that I
[2:47:10] want. And in the book probably some of
[2:47:12] you read of that
[2:47:14] night when the maniac ran to the
[2:47:16] platform out there in Oregon.
[2:47:21] He was going to take my
[2:47:23] life. Friends, this is brother William
[2:47:26] Marion
[2:47:28] brother. The same one who gave his
[2:47:31] testimony how he wanted to commit
[2:47:33] suicide. Actually, at another time when
[2:47:37] he was younger, he he tried to shoot
[2:47:40] himself because God did not allow him to
[2:47:42] be like the rest of the of the
[2:47:45] boys. Whenever he's trying to get a
[2:47:48] girlfriend or to
[2:47:50] smoke, a voice
[2:47:53] speaks. He hears a wall of
[2:47:55] we and he was wondering, why does God
[2:47:58] not allow me to be like my
[2:48:02] badies? I enjoy life.
[2:48:06] So then one time he's just all confused
[2:48:09] and he doesn't want, you know, he goes
[2:48:12] down with his hunting
[2:48:14] rifle and said, "Let me kill
[2:48:17] myself." So he took the gun
[2:48:21] and you know, uh, you know, pulled the
[2:48:25] trigger on his
[2:48:28] head and the bullet did not come out.
[2:48:34] He was so
[2:48:36] disappointed. He threw it away. And the
[2:48:39] moment he threw it out, the blood came
[2:48:44] out. So he couldn't kill himself. Second
[2:48:48] time he wants to kill himself on
[2:48:52] live. Can you imagine? This is a man
[2:48:55] supposed to be the prophet of our
[2:48:58] generation. He wants to commit suicide.
[2:49:01] If I come to you and I give you a
[2:49:03] testimony, said brethren, the whole of
[2:49:06] this week, I was having suicide
[2:49:09] thoughts. How many of you would have
[2:49:11] confidence in me as
[2:49:14] your brother Baka? Would you
[2:49:18] trust? Brother is shaking his
[2:49:22] head. suicide case. But yet here is a
[2:49:26] prophet of a
[2:49:28] generation contemplating murder,
[2:49:32] suicide twice, it needn't work
[2:49:36] out. Someone said now
[2:49:40] here after he has gone through those
[2:49:43] phases of his
[2:49:45] life, God has brought him down.
[2:49:51] God has assured
[2:49:53] him, you are going to do my job whether
[2:49:55] you want or
[2:49:58] not. You are going to preach the gospel.
[2:50:01] You're going to heal the sick. You're
[2:50:03] going to trouble the world whether you
[2:50:05] want or not. And if you don't want, you
[2:50:08] will face
[2:50:10] it. And if you try to kill yourself, you
[2:50:14] can't even die.
[2:50:17] If you try to drown, water will spit
[2:50:20] you. If you try to shoot yourself, I
[2:50:23] will stop the
[2:50:24] bullet. If you try to tell power to to
[2:50:27] to shock you, I will send the angel to
[2:50:30] pull you away. You cannot die until you
[2:50:34] submit
[2:50:35] yourself to become
[2:50:38] vulnerable in my presence for you to be
[2:50:41] used by me.
[2:50:44] William Ram, you must be a man after my
[2:50:48] heart because you are the one I've
[2:50:50] chosen
[2:50:51] for when God is interested in
[2:50:53] you. You don't know what what is
[2:51:00] happening. Sometimes you see you you see
[2:51:03] people but a man of God is not just a
[2:51:09] person. A servant of God is not just a
[2:51:14] human
[2:51:15] being. I wish I could continue on that
[2:51:18] line. I will show you many
[2:51:21] examples. You go and check any so-called
[2:51:23] man of
[2:51:25] God. God truth. You will see that their
[2:51:29] life is not
[2:51:31] normal. God guards them
[2:51:33] jealously. God protects them. They
[2:51:36] cannot die. And I will tell you
[2:51:38] something. Every child of God is a
[2:51:41] servant of
[2:51:43] God. We are all
[2:51:47] peculiar. Yes, sir. If the world thinks
[2:51:50] they can play around with
[2:51:52] you, they are wasting their
[2:51:55] time. Here is a man after brother Bam is
[2:52:00] trained and brother stands on the
[2:52:03] pulpit now to do the will of
[2:52:05] God. And then here is this man, a
[2:52:08] maniac.
[2:52:10] He had been known for
[2:52:13] years. Everybody feared him. So he
[2:52:18] went to go. He told Brother Bam, "I'll
[2:52:23] pull you from that
[2:52:24] pullpit. I'll break every bone in
[2:52:28] your brother Bam remain on
[2:52:31] the A very humble man."
[2:52:35] The de said, "No,
[2:52:37] no. Leave him alone. I'm doing God's
[2:52:41] will. Let him come and break
[2:52:43] everyone in my
[2:52:45] body." So the man
[2:52:49] came. Brethren here is a man who tried
[2:52:53] to kill himself. He couldn't succeed.
[2:52:56] Now you think a man can kill
[2:53:00] you. The devil is a joker. Ah, the devil
[2:53:03] is a joker.
[2:53:06] Oh, brethren, give the brother good
[2:53:07] microphone. This one is not working now.
[2:53:09] You see, listen, listen, brother, you
[2:53:12] don't worry about the microphone. Come,
[2:53:14] if you want, I can give you mine.
[2:53:15] Listen, the devil is a joker. He thought
[2:53:18] he can actually kill this
[2:53:23] man.
[2:53:25] Brethren was a think about it together.
[2:53:29] This is a man who tried to kill you and
[2:53:32] he failed. Do you think the devil could
[2:53:35] now kill
[2:53:39] him? I will fear no evil. The Lord is my
[2:53:44] shepherd. Here is a
[2:53:47] man. In other words, is saying if I
[2:53:50] couldn't kill
[2:53:52] myself, then nothing can kill me but
[2:53:55] God.
[2:54:01] So here when came someone asked him
[2:54:05] brotherham was you
[2:54:07] scared he said no
[2:54:12] sir not a
[2:54:14] bit as long as Jesus is there as long as
[2:54:18] he told me to do this and I am in his
[2:54:22] will there is nothing to
[2:54:25] fear as long as you are doing what he
[2:54:27] says
[2:54:29] do and and and you know you are directly
[2:54:35] led well then there is nothing to
[2:54:37] fear. Perfect love casts out all
[2:54:42] fear. There is no fear in
[2:54:45] God. Love takes away
[2:54:48] fear. That is a man who knows that he
[2:54:51] knows and he knows that God is real.
[2:54:57] And that was not
[2:54:58] pride. I see the same thing in David.
[2:55:01] And that was not pride. Is the same
[2:55:03] thing is the knowing that God is
[2:55:08] real and you are fully submitted to
[2:55:12] him. You're fully vulnerable to
[2:55:15] him. Can I now say this? If you're
[2:55:19] vulnerable in his
[2:55:20] presence, there is nothing can finish
[2:55:23] you before your time.
[2:55:27] Amen. Yes
[2:55:29] sir. When a man kneels before
[2:55:32] God, no demon can amen be able to
[2:55:36] destroy. If you kneel before God, no
[2:55:40] temptation can
[2:55:41] destroy. If you kneel before God, no
[2:55:45] heartbreak can
[2:55:47] break. Your ship may be
[2:55:50] wrecked, but you cannot be
[2:55:52] wrecked. As long as you're
[2:55:55] vulnerable in the presence of God.
[2:56:01] Amen.
[2:56:03] Amen.
[2:56:05] Letting off the
[2:56:07] pressure. Brother says something here
[2:56:09] very
[2:56:10] interesting. He says and you know and
[2:56:13] then the nervous neurotic age that we
[2:56:15] are living in.
[2:56:19] You know, in all of
[2:56:21] this, the doctors don't have the
[2:56:24] answer. Tell your neighbors, doctors
[2:56:27] don't have the
[2:56:29] answer. Dr. Money doesn't have the
[2:56:34] answer. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. You
[2:56:38] know, in all of
[2:56:40] this, because the dog doesn't have the
[2:56:42] answers because they themselves are also
[2:56:44] plagued with it.
[2:56:50] They don't have the answer. They don't
[2:56:52] know what to do. You say, "Oh,
[2:56:55] doctor, I'm just about to blow my
[2:56:59] head. I don't know what to do."
[2:57:03] As well, he would say, "I am
[2:57:11] too. It's a neurotic age.
[2:57:16] Let me tell
[2:57:19] you, I meet people in my office here and
[2:57:23] I'm telling you our generation is losing
[2:57:26] it. People are
[2:57:28] crazy. Maybe because of poverty. But I
[2:57:32] want to say because of
[2:57:33] demon people losing
[2:57:36] it. People are getting
[2:57:39] crazy. They're losing their
[2:57:44] mind. I wish H I wish I could be able to
[2:57:47] give you
[2:57:49] stories but I
[2:57:51] can't but I'm telling you people are
[2:57:54] losing their
[2:57:56] mind. Doctors don't have
[2:57:59] answers. Well, he would say I am
[2:58:03] too. Well, there is nothing you can
[2:58:06] do. He will give you a tranquilizer.
[2:58:12] Well, that wears us
[2:58:14] off. You are more nervous than you was
[2:58:16] in the first place.
[2:58:43] [Music]
[2:58:50] Exactly. And then you get
[2:58:53] better
[2:58:57] after the pain gets bigger. Our
[2:59:01] generation is a generation you are
[2:59:03] finding young children taking sleeping
[2:59:11] medication. Listen listen good. If you
[2:59:15] are here and you are below 40 50
[2:59:19] years and you are drinking sleeping
[2:59:23] medication you need what I'm giving you
[2:59:25] this
[2:59:26] morning. You need spiritual
[2:59:30] help. It's not
[2:59:33] normal. The Bible say God gives his
[2:59:36] beloved
[2:59:41] sleep. When it is when it is night, you
[2:59:44] must be able to sleep
[2:59:46] well. But you find young people can't
[2:59:49] sleep. They are on phone. They're
[2:59:53] working at
[2:59:54] night. Oh god.
[2:59:57] on our generation. What is it? It's a
[3:00:01] end time
[3:00:03] plague. It's plaguing our
[3:00:06] generation. But the Bible says it's a
[3:00:08] nervous
[3:00:13] neurotic and you you don't have sleep at
[3:00:16] night. What? You need help but you you
[3:00:21] don't want to ask for it. You are
[3:00:23] covering it
[3:00:25] up. How I am fine. Are you really
[3:00:29] fine? You're not. You need
[3:00:33] help. You see, you go and doctor will
[3:00:35] give you a trunk like a sleeping
[3:00:39] m as soon as it wears off. You are more
[3:00:43] nervous than you
[3:00:45] was. Like a drunk man taking an extra
[3:00:50] drink to get over his
[3:00:53] drunk. You can do it.
[3:00:56] There is no answer. They don't have the
[3:00:59] answer. But God has the
[3:01:03] answer. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. God has
[3:01:08] the
[3:01:09] answer. Oh, do you believe it,
[3:01:12] church? God has the answer. That is what
[3:01:16] we want to
[3:01:18] take. Talk about to have the
[3:01:21] answer. God has got the answer. Oh, he
[3:01:25] has the answer. He has said it four
[3:01:27] times. God has the answer. God has got
[3:01:31] the answer. Talk about the answer. He
[3:01:34] has the answer. God has the answer. He
[3:01:37] has the answer because he is the
[3:01:42] answer. Amen. Hallelujah. Christ is the
[3:01:46] answer to every problem we
[3:01:50] are. Witchcraft is not the answer.
[3:01:53] Doctors are not the answer. You know,
[3:01:56] you know, psychiatric and all this
[3:01:57] psychology is not the
[3:02:01] answer. But let me tell you, Christ is
[3:02:04] the answer. Jesus is the
[3:02:08] answer. Amen. To every problem we have.
[3:02:12] Now, we are going to talk about him now.
[3:02:14] So, we see God chose to use
[3:02:18] brother. He was a poor he had a poor
[3:02:20] background as we saw.
[3:02:24] He tried to commit suicide two
[3:02:27] times. He was not
[3:02:29] perfect. He suffered things until it
[3:02:31] broke
[3:02:33] him and made him to learn to trust
[3:02:36] God. God has all the
[3:02:39] answers. He was a man that truly became
[3:02:42] vulnerable before the
[3:02:45] president. In the same way God chose to
[3:02:47] use
[3:02:48] David, there was a man who really was
[3:02:50] vulnerable before the Lord.
[3:02:53] He opened his heart before the
[3:02:56] Lord
[3:03:00] situation. May God help us to accept God
[3:03:04] as the
[3:03:07] solution. If you look at Hannah in the
[3:03:11] Bible, Hannah prayed through her
[3:03:14] pain. Hannah was deeply
[3:03:17] distressed because she didn't have
[3:03:19] children. Instead of pretending to be
[3:03:22] okay, she went to the temple and she
[3:03:25] poured out a
[3:03:27] salt. Her vulnerability touched
[3:03:30] God and God answered. 1 Samuel 1 15
[3:03:36] says, "And Hannah answered and
[3:03:38] said, "No, my Lord, I am a woman of a
[3:03:43] sorrowful
[3:03:47] spirit." If you're a woman like that,
[3:03:51] You are in good company.
[3:03:54] I have drunk neither wine nor strong
[3:03:57] drinks, but I have powered out my
[3:04:01] soul before the
[3:04:03] Lord. That is
[3:04:07] vulnerability. She went before the Lord
[3:04:09] and powered out her
[3:04:12] soul. Sister, if you have a sorrowful
[3:04:18] spirit, please don't hold it
[3:04:22] in. No,
[3:04:24] don't. You don't even not need to talk
[3:04:26] to
[3:04:28] me. Go before the
[3:04:31] Lord. Empower your
[3:04:35] soul in
[3:04:38] vulnerability before
[3:04:40] him. This is what Hannah did.
[3:04:44] And God answered right
[3:04:46] there. Because Hannah was vulnerable in
[3:04:48] his
[3:04:49] presence, Job was wrestling with his
[3:04:52] suffering. He lost everything and he
[3:04:55] didn't even hold back, you know, his
[3:04:57] pain and his
[3:05:02] questions. You go and read the book of
[3:05:04] Job. Job questioned
[3:05:07] God until you would think
[3:05:10] Job. He never kept quiet.
[3:05:14] He brought he never held back his
[3:05:18] pain or his questions. He said things
[3:05:22] many wouldn't dare say
[3:05:25] today. But instead of God rejecting
[3:05:28] him, God commanded Job for being real.
[3:05:36] He said, "Though he slay me, yet I will
[3:05:40] trust in him, I will speak in the
[3:05:43] bitterness of my
[3:05:47] soul." This is what he said. That's why
[3:05:50] when prophet Elu came. The first person
[3:05:54] he rebuked was
[3:05:56] Job for ting up
[3:06:00] himself and and making himself feel like
[3:06:02] as if he he was so better than how God
[3:06:06] judged
[3:06:08] him. But he was just
[3:06:11] bitter. Job Job was having a hest
[3:06:17] struggle. But you see that took him into
[3:06:20] a deeper revelation of who God is.
[3:06:26] He said one time even though the skin
[3:06:29] worms destroy my
[3:06:32] body yet you know he spoke by
[3:06:35] revelation with my eyes I will wash I
[3:06:38] will
[3:06:39] see I will see as he is he he had a
[3:06:44] revelation
[3:06:49] Peter was weeping after denying Jesus
[3:06:53] And after he denied Jesus three times,
[3:06:55] the Bible says Peter remembered the word
[3:06:58] of
[3:06:59] Jesus and he went out and
[3:07:05] wept. His tears were for a
[3:07:09] moment, but that moment of
[3:07:13] vulnerability and
[3:07:15] repentance, Jesus later restored
[3:07:18] him in love. But friends, I want you to
[3:07:22] see I want you to look at Peter on one
[3:07:25] side and see Judas on the
[3:07:28] other. Judas on the other side never
[3:07:32] accepted his
[3:07:33] sin. His heart was never
[3:07:37] broken. He was another
[3:07:41] kind. Judas betrayed
[3:07:43] Jesus. Peter betrayed
[3:07:45] Jesus. Same sin.
[3:07:49] But I want you to see the natures of the
[3:07:53] heart. The heart of of of Peter was so
[3:07:59] broken. When Jesus
[3:08:01] said those words, he
[3:08:07] remembered when before
[3:08:10] cross he remembered when he remembered.
[3:08:14] He didn't
[3:08:18] say the milk is
[3:08:20] spilled. So what can I do
[3:08:23] now? After all, he also said it. So he
[3:08:26] knew I would do
[3:08:27] it. So he will have mercy on whom he
[3:08:31] will have mercy. That's not a heart of
[3:08:34] God. They look at the heart. A man with
[3:08:38] a God
[3:08:40] heart. The Bible says he broke down and
[3:08:44] he wept.
[3:08:50] You see, but Judas when he knew
[3:08:56] what he had done,
[3:08:58] he never he even had a
[3:09:01] flesh. He was like,
[3:09:04] "What? You mean have killed him?" At
[3:09:07] some point, actually, I believe that
[3:09:09] Judas was a real real
[3:09:14] hypocrite. But I believe her
[3:09:20] an unbelief. Of
[3:09:24] course, but a believer. You see how
[3:09:26] confusing it
[3:09:28] is? He followed Jesus. Jesus Jesus
[3:09:32] humanly Jesus trusted
[3:09:33] him. He gave him the
[3:09:37] bag. This is a man who went to the to
[3:09:40] these
[3:09:40] people. He had seen what Jesus can
[3:09:44] do. He knows he can turn water into
[3:09:47] he can disappear when they catch him. So
[3:09:50] he knew his master Jesus will do a
[3:09:55] trick and
[3:09:58] disappear. So he said the way I'm
[3:10:01] counting this
[3:10:03] mathematics I can take this money for
[3:10:07] building the kingdom of
[3:10:08] God and then I
[3:10:11] go and kiss him and betray him. But at
[3:10:15] the same time when they catch him he
[3:10:18] will disappear. And I remain with the
[3:10:20] money and Jesus has disappeared and the
[3:10:23] kingdom of God will
[3:10:27] flourish. Those are done by
[3:10:31] unbelievers. Believers never betray
[3:10:34] Jesus at any
[3:10:37] time. Amen. Don't betray him at the
[3:10:40] school.
[3:10:42] They invite you at the
[3:10:43] bar. Tell them I cannot come. I am a
[3:10:51] believer. So let me go at the bar. They
[3:10:54] would drink alcohol. I will drink soda.
[3:10:58] While I am being an example to them and
[3:11:01] I am not alo offending them and I will
[3:11:04] preach to them by my example.
[3:11:12] You are not
[3:11:13] vulnerable. You are being a
[3:11:15] hypocrite. That's not your
[3:11:18] place. Come out
[3:11:20] from what you have been preached
[3:11:22] to. A believer has no place in a
[3:11:27] bar. A believer has no place in a
[3:11:31] discourse. Our place is in the house of
[3:11:35] God.
[3:11:37] David said unto me, I was happy when
[3:11:39] they said unto me, let's go to the house
[3:11:40] of
[3:11:42] God. Amen. And we can dance. But our
[3:11:46] dance is not for the world. Our dance is
[3:11:50] not for worldly music. We will not
[3:11:52] betray Jesus.
[3:11:57] You find a believer because it is a
[3:12:00] cultural
[3:12:02] event dancing those sexual
[3:12:05] dances. Shame on you.
[3:12:08] We have been
[3:12:10] made to come out from among
[3:12:12] them. We are the royal
[3:12:15] priesthood. We are not like
[3:12:18] them. Culture has to
[3:12:20] die. Religion has to die.
[3:12:24] Oh pastor, are you not taking it too
[3:12:26] far?
[3:12:28] Well, I will tell you something. Jesus
[3:12:31] died and when he died, I died with him.
[3:12:35] I am born
[3:12:37] again. I am not
[3:12:46] a
[3:12:48] Christian. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir.
[3:12:52] No for us we
[3:12:53] are see I am not I am called out I will
[3:12:59] involve
[3:13:00] myself in their cultural
[3:13:02] activities as long as they don't make me
[3:13:05] betray the
[3:13:09] word but if it is
[3:13:11] something questionable I am sorry I am
[3:13:15] not going to be a part of
[3:13:17] it I'm not going to be a part of it
[3:13:19] because I am I I am a new creation.
[3:13:24] But you see, Judas thought he will hit
[3:13:29] 50/50 and then he will be a winner. I'm
[3:13:32] a winner either
[3:13:33] way. No, you
[3:13:36] cannot. If you betray him, you are
[3:13:40] done. And he betrayed him and then he
[3:13:45] waited after kissing
[3:13:49] him. I don't know what you can
[3:13:52] do. Jesus, don't disappoint me. I know
[3:13:55] what you can
[3:13:56] do. And then Peter came. Peter, a
[3:14:00] serious
[3:14:01] believer when a man tried to
[3:14:03] cut. Peter was angry, picked a
[3:14:08] knife, cut off the
[3:14:10] ear. And Jesus was there. Jesus, come
[3:14:13] on. Come on. I know what you can do. And
[3:14:17] then Jesus went down. Pet Jesus was
[3:14:23] like, "Let's do it." And then he picked
[3:14:26] the
[3:14:27] ear. And I'm sure whatever Judas was, he
[3:14:31] told one of
[3:14:32] those I told my
[3:14:35] master, "You wait and see
[3:14:38] what he's sweating. The sweat is sweat
[3:14:42] of confusion."
[3:14:45] And he picked the ear and he put it
[3:14:49] back. He that kills with a sword
[3:14:53] die with a sword. Put your swords down.
[3:14:56] And the ear was there. Jesus was
[3:15:00] like, I knew it. I knew it. Now you
[3:15:05] can't catch
[3:15:09] him. Like I
[3:15:12] said, I'm glad to keep the money and you
[3:15:16] can't catch my
[3:15:20] lord. Go and eat the
[3:15:24] boy. You know, you will not escape
[3:15:28] him. You will get a disease unless you
[3:15:33] [Music]
[3:15:37] repent. We believers
[3:15:41] We don't hang out with boys and girls.
[3:15:44] I'm going to hang
[3:15:45] out. A believer going
[3:15:50] for shame on you, sister. Shame on you,
[3:15:53] brother. You are betraying
[3:15:57] Jesus. You're going to hang
[3:16:00] out.
[3:16:05] You sin will take you further.
[3:16:09] then you want to go.
[3:16:14] Younger sisters and brothers should be
[3:16:16] able to shout
[3:16:18] amen. That's what we stand
[3:16:21] for. And then Judas was like, "Money is
[3:16:26] here. My lord is
[3:16:29] in now." Peter who was making himself
[3:16:32] spiritual. Even Jesus has rebuked him.
[3:16:35] He has put back the
[3:16:37] ear that is defending the word. You
[3:16:41] can't defend the
[3:16:42] word for us who decided to go take the
[3:16:46] money. We are
[3:16:51] progressing and at the same time they
[3:16:54] came but they caught
[3:16:58] Jesus. Judas was like come on my Lord do
[3:17:02] the thing. Do the thing. You remember
[3:17:04] the other time when they wanted Jesus
[3:17:06] and he
[3:17:07] disappeared. He thought he was going to
[3:17:12] die and then they caught him another
[3:17:15] hand. They took
[3:17:19] him. He followed. So they're beating
[3:17:23] him. This is different. Something is
[3:17:27] wrong. I've done wrong. I've done wrong.
[3:17:31] But when he realized he has done
[3:17:33] wrong, he did not become vulnerable
[3:17:36] before God.
[3:17:39] But
[3:17:40] he felt guilt.
[3:17:44] A feeling of
[3:17:46] guilt is different from a feeling of
[3:17:54] vulnerability. When you feel
[3:17:57] guilt, it doesn't mean you are repented.
[3:18:01] Any human being has a guilt
[3:18:06] conscience whether they are Christians
[3:18:08] or
[3:18:10] not. But a child of God will become
[3:18:15] vulnerable. Kneel before God and repent
[3:18:18] of your sin. And repentance means never
[3:18:21] go back
[3:18:25] again. And what happened to this man?
[3:18:28] He felt guilty and he went back to these
[3:18:32] people and told them I have changed my
[3:18:37] mind. I cannot take your
[3:18:41] money. They told him Mr. Judas we are
[3:18:45] sorry the job is done. You did a good
[3:18:49] job. You did a good
[3:18:51] job. You can now go with your money.
[3:18:57] Then many young ladies in our generation
[3:19:00] in this neurotic age, they'll begin to
[3:19:03] say I even want to abort
[3:19:06] now. Let me tell you, abortion is
[3:19:12] mother. And unless you repent before
[3:19:16] God, you will be judged if you do those
[3:19:18] kind of
[3:19:20] things. Amen.
[3:19:23] Repentance is accepting your sin
[3:19:26] and being vulnerable before you say God
[3:19:29] have mercy on you.
[3:19:31] Accept me the way I
[3:19:33] am. I am ready to walk
[3:19:36] right. And you know what? At that moment
[3:19:40] they took the money and bought a
[3:19:44] field. And this
[3:19:46] guy went in that
[3:19:48] place and hanged
[3:19:52] himself said I have no hope. I am
[3:19:56] hopeless. He hanged
[3:19:58] himself. He never
[3:20:00] [Music]
[3:20:02] repented. A different heart.
[3:20:06] Same heart that Cain
[3:20:09] had. My punishment is greater than I can
[3:20:14] bear. Genesis 4:13, unrepentant
[3:20:18] heart, hard heart. But God wants those
[3:20:21] who have a
[3:20:23] vulnerable. You see Jesus as our
[3:20:26] example. When he came on earth, he
[3:20:29] showed us the same
[3:20:31] way. He even in his humanity.
[3:20:36] when he was in the garden before his
[3:20:40] crucification, he showed
[3:20:43] vulnerability. He said, and I'm quoting,
[3:20:47] my soul is exceeding
[3:20:50] sorrowful even unto death, oh my father,
[3:20:55] if it be possible, let this cup pass
[3:20:58] through.
[3:20:59] That was
[3:21:01] God in flesh showing vulnerability of a
[3:21:04] human
[3:21:05] being. He brought his raw
[3:21:10] emotions and he still surrendered
[3:21:14] completely. Can you imagine Jesus said I
[3:21:17] even feel like
[3:21:19] dying? That's what it means. I feel like
[3:21:22] dying. Oh
[3:21:24] God. Did God kill you?
[3:21:28] But when he was praying, he expressed
[3:21:30] his
[3:21:31] feelings. Brother, sister, learn how to
[3:21:35] pray, when he come before God. Believe
[3:21:39] that he
[3:21:40] is a
[3:21:42] rewarder of all those who are
[3:21:45] vulnerable.
[3:21:47] Hallelujah. The woman with the alabaster
[3:21:51] box, she wept at Jesus's feet.
[3:21:56] She wept at Jesus's feet. She washed his
[3:22:00] feet with
[3:22:01] tears and anointed them with expensive
[3:22:05] oil. She was risking
[3:22:09] rejection from those around her. But
[3:22:13] Jesus said, "Oh my, it means those who
[3:22:17] come before
[3:22:18] Jesus and
[3:22:20] bow before him, cry,
[3:22:24] wash his feet.
[3:22:29] Your expensive clothes, you put it down
[3:22:30] on the
[3:22:35] floor. You accept to be
[3:22:41] vulnerable. It will do
[3:22:43] something. This woman Jesus told
[3:22:46] her
[3:22:48] sins which are
[3:22:51] many are
[3:22:53] forgiven. Why? Because of her
[3:22:57] vulnerability. Her vulnerability led to
[3:22:59] a deep moment of
[3:23:03] worship and
[3:23:04] forgiveness. It means worship is
[3:23:07] connected to
[3:23:09] forgiveness. Brother, whenever we you
[3:23:11] break down in
[3:23:12] worship, something is
[3:23:15] happening. You see, David would would
[3:23:18] sing many of these psalms. They are
[3:23:19] psalms. They're
[3:23:22] prayers. Create
[3:23:26] me. Oh
[3:23:29] god. And renew a right
[3:23:33] [Music]
[3:23:34] spirit.
[3:23:36] Oh, take me not away.
[3:23:40] You know he was praying from your
[3:23:43] presence that is after the scene of
[3:23:46] mother
[3:23:48] and take not your holy spirit from
[3:23:53] me. Restore unto me the joy of your
[3:24:01] salvation and renew arrived
[3:24:03] [Music]
[3:24:06] spirit. God doesn't reject brokenness.
[3:24:11] and
[3:24:12] weakness. He meets us
[3:24:14] there when we are confused,
[3:24:19] disappointed, and
[3:24:23] worrying. He meets
[3:24:25] us. If you give me 10 minutes, I'm going
[3:24:30] to now
[3:24:32] Samson, he also was broken. In the book
[3:24:35] of Judges
[3:24:36] 16:30, Samson said, let me die with a
[3:24:41] Philistine. And he bowed himself with
[3:24:43] all his
[3:24:44] might. And the house fell upon the
[3:24:46] Lord's and upon all the people that were
[3:24:48] there
[3:24:50] in. So the dead which he slew that
[3:24:54] day were more than they which he slew in
[3:24:56] his
[3:24:58] life. Friends, some times you have to
[3:25:03] die with your enemy.
[3:25:05] Samson, brother Paul preached about him
[3:25:08] the other
[3:25:09] day. Quite an interesting
[3:25:11] subject. Samson, a man who was very
[3:25:17] [Music]
[3:25:19] lustfully. He It was not only
[3:25:22] Delila, there were several
[3:25:25] others one after the
[3:25:27] other. And this thing broke
[3:25:30] him. Sin broke him. But when he reached
[3:25:33] the moment, he said, "No, no, no, no.
[3:25:36] That's our now vulnerability."
[3:25:39] He said, "Now, let me die. If I have to
[3:25:41] die, let me die with my
[3:25:44] enemy." And God did not say no. God
[3:25:48] granted the
[3:25:50] desire, God will receive brokenness
[3:25:52] every time, every time, every time,
[3:25:54] every time.
[3:26:00] You see friends, without money, without
[3:26:04] price, brother says something
[3:26:07] interesting. But when our Lord puts his
[3:26:09] chain of love around your
[3:26:13] heart and he pulls you from the ditch of
[3:26:17] sin. He heals every broken
[3:26:21] heart. He takes away all the
[3:26:23] sin. And the bill is put in the sea of
[3:26:28] [Music]
[3:26:30] forgetfulness. The bill of the the bill
[3:26:33] the
[3:26:36] price. He puts you from the ditch of
[3:26:39] sin. He heals you from every broken
[3:26:42] heart. He takes away all your sin and
[3:26:46] you don't have to pay. The
[3:26:48] bill is thrown into the sea of
[3:26:51] forgiveness to remember against you no
[3:26:53] more.
[3:26:55] Come without money. Come without price.
[3:26:59] No matter how bad you are
[3:27:02] cut, how bad you are
[3:27:05] bruised. No matter how your family has
[3:27:08] done, some of you have had break, you
[3:27:11] know, heartbreaks in family, in
[3:27:14] homes. No matter how your family has
[3:27:17] done or what you have done, there is no
[3:27:20] bill to
[3:27:22] read. He heals the heartaches.
[3:27:25] [Music]
[3:27:29] Amen. Yes, sir. Can you say amen? He
[3:27:32] heals the heartache. He heals the
[3:27:35] heartaches. I said he heals the
[3:27:38] heartache. He takes away all your
[3:27:41] sorrows. If you are sorrowful this
[3:27:44] morning, Jesus takes away all your
[3:27:48] sorrows. He was wounded for our
[3:27:50] transgression.
[3:27:52] He was breathed for our
[3:27:53] in the chastisement of our peace was
[3:27:56] upon
[3:27:57] him. And with his
[3:27:59] stripes, we were
[3:28:01] healed. It's all
[3:28:05] free. Amen. But the problem is many
[3:28:09] won't receive it. Many won't receive it.
[3:28:13] And I will tell you why. Because we are
[3:28:16] dominated by a wrong spirit.
[3:28:21] Some people have a wrong
[3:28:23] spirit dominating over them. We are
[3:28:26] dominated by a spirit of a nation.
[3:28:30] You see I told you this what the prophet
[3:28:35] said the national
[3:28:43] spirit those
[3:28:46] things
[3:28:48] spirit they hinder us from
[3:28:52] breakthrough brethren believe
[3:28:55] this spirit they hinder our victory.
[3:29:00] We are dominated by the spirit of the
[3:29:02] nation, the spirit of the world instead
[3:29:06] of being dominated by the spirit of
[3:29:09] God, the Holy
[3:29:11] Spirit that leads us and guides us to
[3:29:14] all
[3:29:17] truth and makes the Bible
[3:29:21] so perfect strength but perfect
[3:29:24] weakness. Now bound God passes the
[3:29:26] nobles.
[3:29:28] And guess the
[3:29:30] weakness. God passes those who thinks
[3:29:32] they are
[3:29:34] something to take
[3:29:36] somebody that don't know
[3:29:39] nothing to order to work his
[3:29:45] purpose in their
[3:29:49] life. God said to Paul, "My strength is
[3:29:53] perfect in your weakness.
[3:29:56] My strength becomes more
[3:29:58] perfect. As you become more
[3:30:00] weaker, more you can yield to me. The
[3:30:04] better I can use you.
[3:30:06] The more you can forget about your
[3:30:10] education, the more you can forget about
[3:30:13] your
[3:30:15] denomination, the more you can forget
[3:30:17] about your
[3:30:18] stuff and yield yourself to it, the more
[3:30:22] I can use
[3:30:23] it because you've become
[3:30:26] weak. I'll make my own purpose
[3:30:33] strong. When we accept become
[3:30:36] weak, God makes his
[3:30:39] purpose in our
[3:30:42] life
[3:30:48] strong. God can make strength out of
[3:30:55] weakness. That's the reason he always
[3:30:57] does it.
[3:31:00] the humility of his own
[3:31:02] son when he was born in a
[3:31:04] manger in a manured
[3:31:07] bar in the cow
[3:31:09] store and he was wrapped in swaddling
[3:31:13] clothing. See, he could have come
[3:31:15] through a
[3:31:17] palace. He could have come, you know,
[3:31:19] through the corridors of
[3:31:22] heaven full of angels salutes.
[3:31:26] But he
[3:31:27] chose to make Christ the example for
[3:31:30] us. And he brought him in
[3:31:33] humility. He never trained him in the
[3:31:36] schools of this
[3:31:37] world, but he trained him by his own
[3:31:40] power. So he could completely yield
[3:31:44] himself not to the thoughts of man or
[3:31:48] the strength of the word, but the to
[3:31:50] yield himself to the power of God. And
[3:31:53] that's the way that's what is us
[3:31:56] today. We yield ourself
[3:31:59] today. Many times we yield to our great
[3:32:02] denomination. We yield ourselves to our
[3:32:04] denominational
[3:32:05] church. What is God to
[3:32:08] say what they say about it? But that's
[3:32:11] contrary to God
[3:32:13] is we've got to
[3:32:15] yield
[3:32:17] ourself to the
[3:32:19] spirit. the spirit of God and to go
[3:32:23] where the spirit says
[3:32:27] go. If you can be so
[3:32:31] vulnerable, friends, this is so personal
[3:32:34] to
[3:32:35] me. If you can be so
[3:32:38] vulnerable to a moment when God leads
[3:32:42] you, you obey
[3:32:45] him. You say, "Lord, if it's your
[3:32:47] will, I'll go. I'll do it. I don't I
[3:32:51] don't care who says
[3:32:53] that. We are his
[3:32:56] children. He would have let us be born
[3:33:01] sinless, perfect without any
[3:33:03] issues. But he allowed many issues to
[3:33:07] come. So we can be
[3:33:11] weak. And then his perfect
[3:33:15] strength can be made
[3:33:17] known in our weakness.
[3:33:22] Brethren, if we can
[3:33:24] accept to be
[3:33:27] vulnerable in his
[3:33:29] presence, let's bow our
[3:33:42] heads. Oh
[3:33:46] God, forgive us, Lord.
[3:33:52] Many times
[3:33:54] Lord we've tried to hide our
[3:33:58] weakness and try to make ourel as though
[3:34:01] we are perfect
[3:34:04] Lord. But Lord you want us to be
[3:34:07] weak so that you can accept
[3:34:10] us if we can come to you
[3:34:13] Lord and express our weakness.
[3:34:18] Lord Jesus, you are ready to say, "Come
[3:34:22] on, my child. I will then show my
[3:34:26] stranger. I will then use
[3:34:29] you." Lord, that's what you
[3:34:31] did. And you were born in a manger of
[3:34:34] God.
[3:34:37] You were God,
[3:34:39] but you came through
[3:34:42] manure through dirt
[3:34:48] and to show
[3:34:51] weakness to show us that your
[3:34:55] strength is made
[3:34:58] perfect in
[3:35:01] weakness. Lord, we have a couple weak
[3:35:03] people here today.
[3:35:06] No doubt I'm one of them,
[3:35:11] Lord. We're crying out to you,
[3:35:15] Lord. Lord, that you will forsake
[3:35:19] us. Lord, you come and strengthen
[3:35:22] us. Lord, we may accept to be
[3:35:27] vulnerable and night. We may accept to
[3:35:29] carry the
[3:35:31] cross and follow after you.
[3:35:34] You did not want us to be
[3:35:37] perfect, but you wanted us to be
[3:35:39] weak that your perfection may be
[3:35:49] sh you this
[3:35:52] morning while you bow your
[3:35:55] head. You that thinks you're nothing.
[3:36:00] You that thinks you are
[3:36:02] weak, you are good for
[3:36:05] nothing. You don't even feel like you
[3:36:08] you ought to be in the
[3:36:11] crowd. You feel so undeserving.
[3:36:16] Oh, I speak to you
[3:36:18] today. You that feels that you're
[3:36:22] brokenhearted. You that feels you you've
[3:36:25] failed God many times.
[3:36:29] But I have a word for you
[3:36:31] today. And I have a word for you
[3:36:35] today. God, Amen, has come down for
[3:36:39] you. And he's speaking to you that Jesus
[3:36:43] died for
[3:36:44] you. He came for you, not for anyone
[3:36:48] else, you in your weakness.
[3:36:52] He wanted you to be that way. So he can
[3:36:55] manifest his
[3:36:57] power and his strength through
[3:36:59] you. If only you can hold
[3:37:02] on, you're going to see his
[3:37:05] strength in your life. He's going to
[3:37:08] lift you
[3:37:09] up. Brother Brandham was so
[3:37:12] weak. Twice he wanted to commit
[3:37:15] sin. He couldn't do it because there was
[3:37:18] a purpose in his life. And he reached
[3:37:20] that moment when he wanted to die. He
[3:37:24] said, "God, take me
[3:37:26] again." God couldn't do it. There was
[3:37:29] purpose in his
[3:37:31] life. But I tell you something, he
[3:37:34] became a prophet to a
[3:37:36] generation. There is something about you
[3:37:38] that is
[3:37:39] special. There's something special about
[3:37:42] you. And you know because the Lord is
[3:37:45] speaking to
[3:37:46] you. I don't have to call your name. He
[3:37:49] has already called your
[3:37:51] name because this was meant for
[3:37:54] you. It was meant for you.
[3:37:58] Hallelujah.
[3:38:00] Oh, his presence is here,
[3:38:02] friend. Don't fear to break in his
[3:38:05] presence. Don't fear to to be frail to
[3:38:09] to be
[3:38:10] weak. It is for you. He
[3:38:13] died. See a prophet
[3:38:15] cried so weak. But yet there was a
[3:38:19] greater
[3:38:20] purpose for
[3:38:22] him. I am right in the will of
[3:38:25] God. Tell you you are right in the
[3:38:29] will. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh yes.
[3:38:34] Wow. Oh yes. Wow. Oh yes.
[3:38:39] Wow. Oh yes. You are so weak. because
[3:38:43] you have a greater
[3:38:46] purpose. Accept the
[3:38:49] weakness. Confess your weakness
[3:38:51] to confess your fears. You don't need to
[3:38:55] get blood
[3:38:57] pressure. You don't need to get
[3:38:59] anxiety. You get it because you are
[3:39:02] putting your fears
[3:39:05] inside. Express it to your
[3:39:08] savior. You have a savior.
[3:39:11] One who
[3:39:13] understand. One who is here to
[3:39:15] help. He will help you for
[3:39:18] sure. Yes sir. He's a faithful
[3:39:23] God. He's a savior of our
[3:39:25] soul. He's a lily of the
[3:39:28] vine. The bright and morning star. When
[3:39:32] no one
[3:39:33] understands, he surely
[3:39:35] understands. He's closer than a brother.
[3:39:40] He understands you better than your
[3:39:41] husband.
[3:39:44] Your husband or
[3:39:46] wife, he's here.
[3:39:49] I want us to have a
[3:39:51] moment for those who are broken in
[3:39:54] him to just
[3:39:57] express their feeling to
[3:39:59] him. He's a high priest today who can be
[3:40:04] touched by the feeling of you are in
[3:40:06] fact.
[3:40:08] He understands
[3:40:10] us. He loves you. He wants to help you
[3:40:13] out of your
[3:40:14] sin. You may say, "No, I'm a big time
[3:40:17] sinner. I've covered so much." He
[3:40:21] understands that, too. Just confess it
[3:40:24] before
[3:40:25] him. Repent before him. Accept weakness
[3:40:28] and fibers.
[3:40:30] Then the savior will come.
[3:40:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The savior will
[3:40:36] come and carry you.
[3:40:38] When your back is against the
[3:40:41] wall, he will come and help you. You may
[3:40:44] say, "I'm so
[3:40:46] broke. I don't know what to do. I don't
[3:40:49] have any help. No one can help me. I'm
[3:40:52] so poor and wretched." No, he's here.
[3:40:56] He's a friend. He's a friend in a weary
[3:41:01] land. No friends, his presence is here.
[3:41:07] He's a rock in a weary
[3:41:10] land. He's a show and a time of storm.
[3:41:18] Hallelujah.
[3:41:20] Hallelujah. Let's just have a moment of
[3:41:23] real deep consecration before him.
[3:41:27] Confess your sins to him.
[3:41:30] Confess your life to him.
[3:41:33] Just tell him how much you want his help
[3:41:35] and
[3:41:38] cry out to him.
[3:41:40] Don't care about your neighbor. What
[3:41:42] will think about you? It's about what he
[3:41:45] will think about
[3:41:46] you. That's why you have come in his
[3:41:48] presence here today. He will help you.
[3:41:52] No man can help you. But he will help
[3:41:56] you. He will carry you out of your
[3:41:59] problem. He knows your
[3:42:02] weakness. He knows your
[3:42:06] foolishness. He knows the depth of the
[3:42:08] trial and
[3:42:10] temptation and he can carry you out.
[3:42:14] He's a savior. He saves you in every
[3:42:18] situation. Oh, help us,
[3:42:25] Lord. I hate you.

[3:57:40] [Music]
[3:57:46] As we are going to pray now,
[3:57:49] I want you with eyes closed,
[3:57:53] tell the Lord, remember
[3:57:55] me, remember my
[3:57:58] need. If you want me to remember you in
[3:58:01] prayer
[3:58:02] now, just lift up your hand to
[3:58:05] him with every head bowed, every eye
[3:58:07] closed.
[3:58:09] Lord Jesus,
[3:58:12] in a moment like this,
[3:58:15] Lord, through the gift of of the
[3:58:18] prophet, you would call out
[3:58:21] people one by
[3:58:24] one, tell their
[3:58:27] problems, discern their lives, and tell
[3:58:30] them it's
[3:58:32] over. The New Testament preaches a
[3:58:35] prophet.
[3:58:38] We have heard the word of
[3:58:40] prophecy. And at this moment, I'm
[3:58:44] convinced the same Jesus that walked the
[3:58:48] streets of Jerusalem,
[3:58:50] the same Jesus that was with the prophet
[3:58:53] of this
[3:58:55] generation, the same that was with the
[3:58:57] apostles, the God of the Bible is here
[3:59:01] right
[3:59:03] now. Lord, we can feel your presence.
[3:59:11] Oh
[3:59:14] Jesus. Oh Jesus.
[3:59:18] Do not pass us
[3:59:20] by. You see the needs in the
[3:59:23] body. The needs in every
[3:59:27] family. The needs in every
[3:59:30] [Music]
[3:59:31] home. Oh you know and understand.
[3:59:39] Come now,
[3:59:42] Lord. Help my brother make a right
[3:59:49] decision. Yes,
[3:59:51] Lord. You are the same yesterday, today,
[3:59:54] and
[3:59:59] forever. Oh,
[4:00:01] hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's nothing
[4:00:04] impossible in your
[4:00:07] praises. There's nothing
[4:00:10] impossible. All things shall be
[4:00:14] possible. Present, please
[4:00:17] believe. All things are
[4:00:20] possible in his
[4:00:24] presence. He's here to guide
[4:00:27] you. He's here to lead you. He's here to
[4:00:30] strengthen you.
[4:00:33] If you good but
[4:00:35] touch the hem of his
[4:00:39] coming, you'll be
[4:00:41] whole. Maybe you are here. You've wanted
[4:00:45] to take your
[4:00:47] life. You think your back is against the
[4:00:52] wall. You will not take your
[4:00:55] life. Your life is in the hands of
[4:00:57] God and his purpose must be accomplished
[4:01:01] your life.
[4:01:04] to you that is bound in a
[4:01:07] chain, a spiral of
[4:01:12] sin. I'm speaking the name of Jesus upon
[4:01:15] you
[4:01:17] today, let the power of Jesus
[4:01:20] Christ, Amen. And the power that draws
[4:01:23] him from
[4:01:24] that same power which is
[4:01:26] here. Let it touch you right
[4:01:29] now. I deliver you right now because
[4:01:32] he's the savior of your
[4:01:34] soul. That spirit which has been
[4:01:37] tormented. I command it to lose you
[4:01:39] right now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[4:01:44] For is no power that is greater than the
[4:01:46] power of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4:01:49] [Music]
[4:01:51] The yoke is
[4:01:53] broken under the
[4:01:55] anointing for you are being delivered
[4:01:57] right
[4:01:59] now. You are being delivered right
[4:02:03] now to you who is vulnerable in his
[4:02:07] presence. He's granting the desire of
[4:02:09] your
[4:02:11] heart. Now I want you to know whatever
[4:02:14] I'm saying directed by the Holy
[4:02:18] Spirit, he's here right now to tell
[4:02:24] you some of your
[4:02:26] families are receiving a
[4:02:29] touch. Things are not going to be the
[4:02:32] same.
[4:02:34] That power of
[4:02:36] darkness that has changed your
[4:02:40] home. Your home right
[4:02:43] now declaring it
[4:02:50] free. Oh
[4:02:53] hallelujah. Oh
[4:02:57] Jesus. Oh hallelujah.
[4:03:02] Oh Jesus.

[4:03:09] Oh Jesus.
[4:03:12] Listen brother, don't be worried. His
[4:03:14] presence is here to deliver you. He
[4:03:17] knows your situation. He will take you
[4:03:18] out of it. He will take you out of it.
[4:03:21] He has never failed before. You've not
[4:03:23] failed even in your case. There is
[4:03:25] nothing too hard for him. He's
[4:03:28] here to touch you, to deliver you.
[4:03:33] Stand boldly in his
[4:03:37] presence. Stand boldly in his presence
[4:03:39] and watch him do the miraculous. Watch

[4:03:50] yes. Oh
[4:03:52] yes. You feel so insufficient to serve
[4:03:55] God. That's not the voice of God. It's
[4:03:58] the voice of Satan trying to discourage
[4:04:01] you. Drop it off of your life. Accept
[4:04:05] the voice of God into your life. You are
[4:04:07] born to serve God. You are born to live
[4:04:10] for God. You are born to live the life
[4:04:13] of righteousness. Nothing will hinder
[4:04:15] you to do that for it's the will of
[4:04:20] God.
