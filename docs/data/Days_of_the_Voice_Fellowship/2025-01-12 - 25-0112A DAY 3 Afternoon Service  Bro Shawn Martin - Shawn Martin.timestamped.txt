[1:21:42] report since this is we usually do it's
[1:21:45] like a custom that we do every every

[1:21:59] we going to get
[1:22:01] the we going to ask
[1:22:04] ourselves and we divided the church into
[1:22:06] seven
[1:22:08] groups each group collects money every
[1:22:12] week and in some of those
[1:22:15] groups Believers from other Church even
[1:22:21] join and so we compete like that
[1:22:25] and then we announce a weekly
[1:22:29] amount since we did not have our church
[1:22:31] Sunday
[1:22:34] Serv me

[1:27:58] food
[1:28:00] and I was uh hoping that when I come up
[1:28:04] this way I would lose some
[1:28:08] weight I don't think
[1:28:12] that so we'll have to find another way
[1:28:15] but uh we uh we appreciate uh uh the the
[1:28:19] cooking appreciate the musicians
[1:28:28] appreciate the um uh the
[1:28:32] interpretation amen praise the Lord and
[1:28:37] uh it's just always good to be around
[1:28:39] God's
[1:28:42] people uh before we go into the word may
[1:28:45] we just bow our heads and talk to the
[1:28:49] Lord you know in in this day that we're
[1:28:52] living in we we need him
[1:28:56] and uh we certainly need him uh today
[1:28:58] this
[1:29:00] afternoon and if you have any need
[1:29:04] um present it before the
[1:29:07] Lord amen and as we pray
[1:29:11] father lord it's it's just been good to
[1:29:15] to be with your
[1:29:17] people and Lord we know that you care
[1:29:22] for them
[1:29:25] you showed that you cared because you
[1:29:27] gave your own
[1:29:31] blood Lord for
[1:29:34] them and as the prophet said if I had
[1:29:38] two drops of blood in a charger in a
[1:29:44] cup how precious it would be and how
[1:29:50] careful he would be uh uh to handle it
[1:29:56] but then he said he got to thinking how
[1:29:59] standing before him
[1:30:02] and I believe standing before me
[1:30:06] today is something greater than your
[1:30:11] blood it's your
[1:30:13] people father for you gave your blood
[1:30:16] for
[1:30:18] them and Lord I pray that you would just
[1:30:21] come in a special way
[1:30:24] that you would meet every need
[1:30:26] Lord father may your anointing just be
[1:30:31] here not only anoint me but anoint The

[1:30:43] lovely name Jesus
[1:30:46] Christ and the church
[1:30:49] says amen and
[1:30:52] amen if you'd like to turn with me to
[1:30:55] the book of Isaiah the 43rd
[1:31:04] chapter and uh we want to just say we
[1:31:08] appreciate brother
[1:31:10] Josh driving us back and forth to the
[1:31:16] hotel I think this morning all of us
[1:31:19] ministers voted for him to be the best
[1:31:21] driver in this part of Africa
[1:31:27] we certainly appreciate him amen
[1:31:31] appreciate uh Pastor here and opening
[1:31:34] his Pulpit to us and let us uh speak uh
[1:31:39] to the
[1:31:40] church amen and appreciate his
[1:31:42] hospitality and everything that he's
[1:31:44] done for
[1:31:45] us amen uh the book of Isaiah the 43rd
[1:31:51] chapter and um
[1:31:54] let's see the 18th
[1:31:56] verse we'll start there but it says
[1:31:59] remember ye not the former
[1:32:02] things neither consider the things of
[1:32:05] old behold I will do a new thing now it
[1:32:10] shall spring forth shall not uh shall ye
[1:32:15] not know it I will even make a way in
[1:32:18] the wilderness and rivers in the
[1:32:21] desert the Beast of the field shall
[1:32:24] honor me the dragons and the owls
[1:32:26] because I give water in the wilderness
[1:32:29] and rivers in the desert to give drink
[1:32:31] to my people My Chosen amen this people
[1:32:35] have I formed for
[1:32:38] myself and they shall show forth my
[1:32:42] praise amen amen
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:21] mayang
[1:33:27] [Music]
[1:33:42] amen amen you can have your
[1:33:45] seats praise the
[1:33:48] Lord so here we we see that God speaking
[1:33:53] through the proph prophet
[1:33:55] Isaiah he promises to do a something
[1:34:00] new and as we have stated before uh and
[1:34:04] know that any promise of God must come
[1:34:06] to
[1:34:10] pass as the message has taught us that
[1:34:13] God has lotted his word to each
[1:34:19] age and he predestinated a a certain
[1:34:23] people to that
[1:34:26] age to manifest that
[1:34:29] word and we are we are a blessed
[1:34:33] people to be able to look
[1:34:37] back and see what word was allotted for
[1:34:40] the
[1:34:42] age amen and and to see that the people
[1:34:46] that were uh uh predestinated to fulfill
[1:34:50] uh the word for that age
[1:34:54] but we are more
[1:34:56] blessed to know our
[1:34:59] age to know the age that we
[1:35:02] live and to know the word that has been
[1:35:05] predestinated for
[1:35:07] us and not only to know the word that's
[1:35:10] been predestinated to this
[1:35:12] age but to know we've been predestinated
[1:35:15] to that
[1:35:18] word can you say Amen so then we've got
[1:35:21] a
[1:35:22] purpose we're not just floating around
[1:35:26] we're not just accepting
[1:35:28] anything and and I I
[1:35:30] believe that this
[1:35:33] scripture that uh we we read I believe
[1:35:36] it's very applicable for our
[1:35:39] age I believe that we're living in an
[1:35:42] age that God is doing something
[1:35:46] new amen now I I looked this word
[1:35:52] new it means having recently come into
[1:35:58] existence being something other than the
[1:36:01] former or
[1:36:05] old so if it's
[1:36:07] new it's not
[1:36:09] old it's not part of the
[1:36:13] old the thing that has
[1:36:16] been it's not this that is
[1:36:19] new can you say Amen so 2 Corinthians 5
[1:36:24] 17 it says therefore If any man be in
[1:36:28] Christ he is a new
[1:36:31] creature or we could say a new
[1:36:35] creation and notice old things are
[1:36:38] passed
[1:36:39] away because the new has come the old
[1:36:43] has passed
[1:36:44] away you can't have the new and the old
[1:36:47] at the same
[1:36:49] time can you
[1:36:51] say so he become a new
[1:36:55] creation and old things are passed
[1:36:58] away behold all
[1:37:01] things somebody say all
[1:37:03] things are become
[1:37:07] new so you don't have to deal with the
[1:37:10] old you don't have to be identified with
[1:37:13] the old
[1:37:15] anymore when God saved you when he
[1:37:19] filled you with the Holy
[1:37:21] Ghost you don't have to deal with with
[1:37:23] the
[1:37:25] old the old habits are
[1:37:28] gone the old desires are
[1:37:30] gone the old Nature has passed
[1:37:34] away can you say Amen now the Bible also
[1:37:38] tells us in Revelations 21
[1:37:41] And1 John said I saw a new
[1:37:45] Heaven and a new
[1:37:47] Earth for the first
[1:37:50] Heaven and the first Earth
[1:37:53] in other words the old
[1:37:55] Heaven the old
[1:37:57] Earth were passed
[1:38:00] away and there was no more
[1:38:03] sea and I John also
[1:38:06] saw the holy
[1:38:08] city knew
[1:38:10] Jerusalem see the old have passed
[1:38:14] away and the new is come
[1:38:17] in and this New Jerusalem
[1:38:21] joha coming down from God out of
[1:38:25] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:38:28] her
[1:38:30] husband and if you notice in the fifth
[1:38:34] verse John says he that sat upon the
[1:38:37] throne said behold I make all things
[1:38:43] new can you say Amen Church were going
[1:38:47] to some place
[1:38:50] new a city that's new
[1:38:53] a world that's
[1:38:55] new no more
[1:38:57] sickness no more
[1:39:00] pain no more
[1:39:02] suffering no more
[1:39:04] diseases no more mind battles no more
[1:39:08] devil to deal with it's everything is
[1:39:12] new can you say man this life is nothing
[1:39:16] but
[1:39:17] corruption this Mortal life is is uh uh
[1:39:21] full of demonic powers
[1:39:24] amen but we're going someplace
[1:39:27] new and he says and the former
[1:39:31] things will not be
[1:39:34] remembered the old
[1:39:36] things will not be
[1:39:39] remembered can you say amen I want to
[1:39:42] say to you God doesn't want you dwelling
[1:39:44] on the
[1:39:46] old God doesn't want you dwelling on
[1:39:49] your
[1:39:51] path God doesn't want you dwelling on
[1:39:53] your
[1:39:54] failures God doesn't want you dwelling
[1:39:57] on the things that he delivered you
[1:39:59] from can you say
[1:40:02] Amen if if something brings your past up
[1:40:05] to you that's the devil that ain't
[1:40:07] God Amen if there's thoughts in your
[1:40:10] mind that remind you of where you used
[1:40:12] to
[1:40:14] be that's the devil because on that
[1:40:18] something that brings up your
[1:40:20] failures that's the devil bringing that
[1:40:24] can you say
[1:40:25] Amen yes
[1:40:26] sir amen so see the old
[1:40:30] way the old
[1:40:32] life the old condition the old
[1:40:37] creation will be done away
[1:40:41] with amen the Bible says remember ye not
[1:40:45] the former
[1:40:46] things neither consider the things of
[1:40:51] old can you
[1:40:53] amen now if you notice what God Said in
[1:40:56] our opening
[1:40:58] scripture is people have I formed for
[1:41:03] myself in other words God's going to do
[1:41:06] a new thing with this
[1:41:08] people can you say
[1:41:10] Amen he's not only going to make you
[1:41:15] new everything about you is going to be
[1:41:19] new your future is going to be new
[1:41:23] life is new you're coming to New
[1:41:27] thoughts can you say amen that's right
[1:41:30] see amen see so this people is the new
[1:41:35] creation that is in Jesus
[1:42:01] there was a mixed multitude that went
[1:42:03] with us amen there was make
[1:42:06] Believers
[1:42:08] unbelievers and Believers ain't that
[1:42:10] right amen and so along the
[1:42:14] journey we we find that there was
[1:42:18] murmuring there was uh
[1:42:21] grumbling there was uh
[1:42:25] unbelief and and and and to think of it
[1:42:28] even though God performed the
[1:42:32] supernatural now listen now he fed them
[1:42:36] supernaturally he ca Mana to come from
[1:42:39] Heaven amen he fed them by a
[1:42:44] rock amen and it wasn't just a trickle
[1:42:46] of water coming down it was a gusher of
[1:42:51] water coming out of a
[1:42:54] rock can you say man listen it had to it
[1:42:58] had to water two and a half million
[1:43:00] people and plus all their
[1:43:03] livestock ain't that right they had the
[1:43:06] angel of the Lord with
[1:43:08] them they had an atonement with him they
[1:43:12] had the pillar of fire with him they had
[1:43:15] a prophet with
[1:43:17] him and yet they didn't know what God
[1:43:20] was doing
[1:43:23] amen and they
[1:43:25] complained they
[1:43:27] grumbled they
[1:43:28] grabbed they was looking for a new
[1:43:32] way when Dayan and cor cor rose
[1:43:36] up they didn't have the Miracles at
[1:43:39] Moses they didn't have the supernatural
[1:43:42] signs that a prophet
[1:43:44] had and yet because they didn't believe
[1:43:46] in the
[1:43:47] prophet and believe in his
[1:43:50] message they went the way of Kora
[1:43:55] can you say amen that's right see and so
[1:43:59] we find that that any time that trouble
[1:44:01] came their
[1:44:03] way they were filled with
[1:44:07] unbelief and they said we want to go
[1:44:10] back we had it better in the old
[1:44:14] dayses we had it better in
[1:44:18] slavery why did you bring us out here to
[1:44:21] die
[1:44:23] because they didn't know that God was
[1:44:25] taking
[1:44:26] them to somewhere
[1:44:29] new can you say man you see in the land
[1:44:33] of
[1:44:34] Egypt they weren't the
[1:44:39] Conqueror in the land of Egypt they had
[1:44:42] no
[1:44:44] inheritance in the land of
[1:44:46] Egypt amen all they were they they they
[1:44:49] had to do amen what the Egyptians wanted
[1:44:52] them to do
[1:44:55] that God was taking them to a
[1:44:58] land to where they would be the
[1:45:04] Overcomers to where they would have
[1:45:08] Victory to where they could claim their
[1:45:12] rights see so he was leading
[1:45:16] them now brother brandham called uh uh
[1:45:19] uh the ones that were grumbling
[1:45:23] he called them old
[1:45:26] Fighters amen old
[1:45:29] Fighters see they just wouldn't accept
[1:45:31] the leadership of
[1:45:33] God through a prophetic
[1:45:37] Ministry I want to make it clear old
[1:45:40] fighter doesn't mean a person in old
[1:45:43] age can you say man so we don't want to
[1:45:47] look at the elders as old
[1:45:50] Fighters amen I'll tell you what an old
[1:45:52] figh is an old fighter is one that is
[1:45:55] stuck in the in the way of
[1:45:58] traditions he's stuck in the way of the
[1:46:01] past an old fighter is one that is is
[1:46:05] fighting against the progress that God
[1:46:07] is trying to bring to his
[1:46:11] people can you say man an old fighter is
[1:46:15] trying to take the people somewhere
[1:46:16] sales other than what a prophet was
[1:46:18] trying to take them
[1:46:21] to so they take the prophet's
[1:46:24] message and distort it to the
[1:46:27] others so as to get them away from the
[1:46:30] real
[1:46:32] thing so we find that when Israel came
[1:46:35] up to the land of
[1:46:38] promise Moses had sent 10 spies to spy
[1:46:42] out the
[1:46:44] land there in numbers 13 and
[1:46:49] 17 it says that Moses sent them to spy
[1:46:52] out the land of
[1:46:54] Canaan and said unto them get you up
[1:46:57] this way Southward and go up into the
[1:47:00] mountain see the land what it is and the
[1:47:05] people that dwelleth therein where
[1:47:08] whether they be strong or weak few or
[1:47:12] many and what the land is that they
[1:47:14] dwell
[1:47:16] in whether it be good or
[1:47:18] bad what cities they be that dwell in
[1:47:23] whether in tents or in
[1:47:26] strongholds now you think of that God's
[1:47:28] already told him what is in that
[1:47:30] land he already told them all the
[1:47:32] promises that is in that
[1:47:34] land but now God wanted them to to see
[1:47:38] for themselves and give a
[1:47:42] report so the Bible says they saw the
[1:47:45] promised
[1:47:46] land and everything that Moses said was
[1:47:51] true they saw the promise
[1:47:54] there but they saw the Giants in the
[1:47:59] land they saw the world
[1:48:03] cities they saw every obstacle that they
[1:48:06] would face in that
[1:48:08] land so notice what kind of report they
[1:48:11] came back
[1:48:13] with they said we came unto the land
[1:48:15] with thou
[1:48:18] sentest and surely it floweth with milk
[1:48:20] and honey
[1:48:23] and this is the fruit of
[1:48:26] it
[1:48:28] nevertheless in other words
[1:48:32] but the people be strong that dwell in
[1:48:35] the
[1:48:35] land and the cities are walled and very
[1:48:39] great and moreover we saw the children
[1:48:42] of anak
[1:48:44] there the Al
[1:48:47] amales and and well a lot of the enemy
[1:48:50] was in the land
[1:48:54] and the 31st verse it says but the men
[1:48:56] that went up with him
[1:48:59] said we be not able to go against them
[1:49:04] people for they are stronger than
[1:49:08] we they forgot the
[1:49:10] promise they forgot the reality of the
[1:49:15] land that God had promised
[1:49:18] them see and so they brought up an evil
[1:49:22] report of the
[1:49:24] land which they had searched unto the
[1:49:27] children of Israel
[1:49:30] saying the land through which we have
[1:49:32] gone to search
[1:49:34] it is a land that eateth up the
[1:49:37] inhabitants
[1:49:38] thereof and all the people that we saw
[1:49:41] in it are men of great
[1:49:44] stature and there we saw the Giants sons
[1:49:47] of
[1:49:50] anoch which come of the Giants
[1:49:53] and notice what they said we were in our
[1:49:56] own
[1:49:57] sight as
[1:50:01] Grasshoppers and so were we in their
[1:50:06] sight see they didn't see themselves as
[1:50:11] conquerors they didn't see themselves as
[1:50:14] the Seed of
[1:50:16] Abraham they didn't see themselves as
[1:50:19] the promised children of God
[1:50:25] they saw themselves as
[1:50:27] weak they saw themselves as
[1:50:30] unable they saw that the enemy was
[1:50:33] greater than
[1:50:35] them therefore they said we can't do
[1:50:39] it and you know what God let them wander
[1:50:44] around the
[1:50:46] Wilderness until they died
[1:50:48] off can you say am man that we find that
[1:50:52] later
[1:50:54] on God raised up
[1:50:57] Joshua with the ministry to take the
[1:51:00] people over into the
[1:51:02] land and not only take them
[1:51:05] over but he positionally placed them in
[1:51:09] the
[1:51:11] land you see Joshua had been given a
[1:51:16] revelation of the
[1:51:18] mystery where the people belonged in the
[1:51:22] land
[1:51:24] and by
[1:51:25] Revelation he would take them people and
[1:51:29] place them in the
[1:51:31] land he didn't look at and say well
[1:51:33] Caleb you're a little stronger than this
[1:51:35] guy so I'm going to put you where you're
[1:51:37] more able to defeat the
[1:51:40] enemy it didn't
[1:51:43] matter because God gave them the
[1:51:46] land and even the weakest Jew or
[1:51:50] Israelites could take their land
[1:51:53] and the enemy couldn't do nothing about
[1:51:57] it can you say amen amen but notice the
[1:52:01] people that he took
[1:52:02] over it was a new
[1:52:06] generation it was a new
[1:52:08] people the old had died
[1:52:11] out all the grumbling had died
[1:52:14] out all the naysayers had died out those
[1:52:18] that have tried to resist the prophet's
[1:52:20] message died out
[1:52:23] those that wouldn't catch the vision
[1:52:24] died
[1:52:26] out and God raised up a new
[1:52:29] generation to take the people
[1:52:33] over can you say amen hallelujah amen
[1:52:36] see God doesn't want you to keep looking
[1:52:39] back don't keep looking
[1:52:42] back if you come out of the world don't
[1:52:44] look back into the
[1:52:46] world if you come out of denominations
[1:52:48] don't look back in that denomination
[1:52:52] can you say
[1:52:54] Amen denominational teaching doesn't
[1:52:56] belong in this
[1:53:00] message come on
[1:53:02] church that's exactly right say he so
[1:53:06] those who had still had the old ways in
[1:53:09] them had to die
[1:53:12] out and God raised up a new
[1:53:15] generation now Church we've been brought
[1:53:19] to the promised land
[1:53:22] has brought us up to the promised
[1:53:25] land brother Andrew talked about the
[1:53:28] vision that brother brandham
[1:53:31] had of walking on the map of
[1:53:35] Palestine and brother Bram tells us of
[1:53:37] the
[1:53:39] vision he said it looked like I was
[1:53:41] standing on the P map of
[1:53:45] Palestine and I was coming down to the
[1:53:49] Jordan seemed like I could hear the song
[1:53:53] I'm going down to the
[1:53:55] Jordan someone was singing
[1:53:58] it and as I drew near the
[1:54:01] river he said I looked back and I seen
[1:54:05] which way I had
[1:54:06] come and I was 2/3 of the
[1:54:11] way first and second
[1:54:14] pull two3 of the way there to
[1:54:19] Jordan and he turned around and he
[1:54:21] looked to Cross
[1:54:24] Jordan he said oh praise God just on the
[1:54:28] other side is where all the promises
[1:54:34] lay the promises don't lay in the first
[1:54:37] pool promises don't lay in the second
[1:54:41] pole the promise lays in that third
[1:54:45] pole then you say
[1:54:47] amen amen he had come up to that Jordan
[1:54:50] River and he says there's where all the
[1:54:52] promises
[1:54:54] are he said every promise lays in the
[1:54:57] promised
[1:54:59] land can you say
[1:55:01] amen amen now I want to tell you where I
[1:55:05] I just believe the the prophet taught us
[1:55:08] is that on the other side in other words
[1:55:11] is where the thoughts of
[1:55:13] God were to come into
[1:55:17] reality because A promise is the
[1:55:19] word and a word is a thought
[1:55:23] expressed and God had thoughts in his
[1:55:26] mind as we have been
[1:55:27] saying amen and now God was now going to
[1:55:31] bring the people
[1:55:34] over not to reflect
[1:55:38] denomination not to reflect the old ways
[1:55:41] of the
[1:55:44] world but to come into the thoughts of
[1:55:48] God you see the prophet said the third
[1:55:51] pool
[1:55:52] is the opening of the
[1:55:54] word and this is God's
[1:55:57] thoughts in seed
[1:56:00] four can you say Amen God's plan is all
[1:56:04] right
[1:56:05] here God's purpose is all right
[1:56:09] here in seat
[1:56:12] form yes sir SE so the the the uh the
[1:56:17] other side I believe is the opening of
[1:56:20] the word in other words
[1:56:23] see in other words the book wasn't
[1:56:25] closed on the other
[1:56:27] side amen had a lot of things on this
[1:56:30] side of the
[1:56:31] river a lot of revivals a lot of things
[1:56:35] that that uh uh people a lot of
[1:56:38] emotions amen but God wasn't satisfied
[1:56:41] with us just saying in the
[1:56:43] Motions God wasn't just satisfied with
[1:56:46] us just uh uh having Pentecostal ideas
[1:56:49] denominational ideas or or whatever
[1:56:53] God was going to take us into the
[1:56:55] promised
[1:56:58] land to where the word
[1:57:01] is can you say
[1:57:03] Amen see no more
[1:57:06] guessing no more
[1:57:08] wondering whether I'm a Son of God or a
[1:57:11] daughter of
[1:57:12] God it's right here in the
[1:57:15] word and it's opening
[1:57:17] up no more wondering if Rapture is for
[1:57:20] me
[1:57:23] no more wondering if Heaven is for
[1:57:25] me no more wanding
[1:57:28] anymore can you say man no more
[1:57:31] wondering if God loves
[1:57:33] me no more wondering if I'm able to
[1:57:38] overcome no war wandering Where I
[1:57:41] Belong I'm not just a Christian floating
[1:57:46] around can you say man no more confusion
[1:57:51] as what really belongs to
[1:57:55] me the book is open on the other
[1:57:59] side the third pool is on the other
[1:58:03] side see it's the land of
[1:58:06] promise can you say amen I can look at
[1:58:10] set this way over
[1:58:12] there is a new way of looking at the
[1:58:16] word of
[1:58:17] God we've had a lot of theologians
[1:58:22] give us their own interpretation of the
[1:58:24] word of
[1:58:26] God we've had a lot of doctors of
[1:58:29] divinity we've had a lot of ministers
[1:58:31] come
[1:58:32] through and give us their own
[1:58:34] interpretation of the word of
[1:58:36] God can you say
[1:58:38] Amen that God would take a people into a
[1:58:42] new
[1:58:44] way of looking at the word of
[1:58:47] God I don't know about you I was raised
[1:58:50] up in the Pentecostal
[1:58:54] I didn't know how to place the
[1:58:56] Bible I thought a lot of the scriptures
[1:58:59] applied in in
[1:59:01] history I thought the things that Paul
[1:59:03] talked about was was was about his
[1:59:08] death amen and preachers didn't know how
[1:59:10] to place the word of
[1:59:12] God can you say Amen so it brought a lot
[1:59:15] of
[1:59:18] confusion hello church amen see we could
[1:59:21] not look at this Bible as the
[1:59:26] promises we knew that God promised to
[1:59:30] heal that could he do it for
[1:59:33] me we knew that he that that he he
[1:59:36] talked about sons of
[1:59:38] God but what about
[1:59:41] me can you say Amen we know there's
[1:59:44] going to be a
[1:59:45] Rapture but we couldn't Place ourselves
[1:59:48] in that
[1:59:49] Rapture see so then we found find amen
[1:59:53] that because of that third pool
[1:59:57] Ministry we find that it's the authority
[2:00:00] of the word of
[2:00:02] God how many believes that the third
[2:00:05] pool
[2:00:07] Ministry is the authority of the word of
[2:00:12] God we've heard it had it right was
[2:00:16] granted the salvation of her
[2:00:19] boys the dead fish that had been
[2:00:22] floating on the water for 30 minutes or
[2:00:26] so was brought back to life by the
[2:00:30] spoken word of
[2:00:32] God the
[2:00:33] snowstorm amen
[2:00:36] snowstorm amen was brought out of
[2:00:39] existence by the spoken word of
[2:00:42] God can you say amen amen what was it it
[2:00:46] was the manifestation of the third
[2:00:50] pool it was a man was on the earth that
[2:00:53] had an
[2:00:54] authority had an authority over
[2:00:57] creation had an authority over a loss
[2:01:00] Soul had an authority by the spoken word
[2:01:04] of
[2:01:05] God you see the third pool is a word of
[2:01:10] creation amen hallelujah can you say
[2:01:13] amen amen let me repeat it for them
[2:01:40] amen amen so the third pull is the word
[2:01:43] of
[2:01:44] creation remember now the same
[2:01:48] God in the
[2:01:50] beginning that spoke his
[2:01:52] word and brought forth the
[2:01:55] world out of
[2:01:58] nothing that same word was spoken on
[2:02:04] Earth not in Jesus
[2:02:07] day in this
[2:02:10] day and a
[2:02:13] man with the spoken
[2:02:15] word created
[2:02:19] squirrels brought squirrels into
[2:02:24] istence it wasn't Jesus
[2:02:27] Christ standing in a Corporal body or
[2:02:30] his Corporal
[2:02:33] body but it was
[2:02:35] Christ in a
[2:02:40] redeemed a new
[2:02:43] creation can you say
[2:02:45] Amen so that same God that said let
[2:02:48] there be
[2:02:49] life and the power of that word brought
[2:02:52] forth
[2:02:54] light was now
[2:02:57] speaking what was it it was the evidence
[2:03:01] of the
[2:03:03] land to show
[2:03:06] us what lay on the other
[2:03:09] side can you say Amen now listen they
[2:03:13] brought evidence back to show the people
[2:03:15] the
[2:03:16] promises and we find out God showed us
[2:03:20] an Evidence
[2:03:22] of what that third pool
[2:03:25] is it's no longer wishing to
[2:03:28] be it's an authority to
[2:03:32] be it's no longer wishing the mountain
[2:03:35] to move
[2:03:37] hallelujah hallelujah it isn't just
[2:03:39] wishing for
[2:03:41] victory it's now having
[2:03:44] authority to claim
[2:03:46] victory to possess your Mountain
[2:03:51] say amen amen but but but notice
[2:03:55] now brother brandham talked about them
[2:03:59] squirrels of being uh uh
[2:04:02] created he said did you
[2:04:04] notice that was sovereignly
[2:04:09] given he said I never asked
[2:04:12] him Lord let me do this speak these
[2:04:16] things in like
[2:04:17] that do these things
[2:04:20] there he said I never asked him
[2:04:23] that he by his own Divine
[2:04:27] will came
[2:04:30] to and said you go do
[2:04:33] this Hallelujah he said I wasn't asking
[2:04:37] one thing about
[2:04:38] it he said Moses never asked to go down
[2:04:42] in
[2:04:43] Egypt but God sent him down
[2:04:47] to amen it ain't making it on our own
[2:04:53] it's not saying a bunch of
[2:04:55] words it's coming under the inspiration
[2:04:57] of the Holy
[2:05:00] Ghost can you say
[2:05:02] Amen see so we find the authority came
[2:05:06] by the inspiration of God to speak
[2:05:11] it now notice the prophet said the new
[2:05:14] group was some
[2:05:16] Fighters I'm not looking at a bunch of
[2:05:19] Fighters today
[2:05:21] can you say amen I I I'm not looking at
[2:05:24] a bunch of
[2:05:26] unbelievers I'm not looking at a people
[2:05:28] that's resisting this
[2:05:29] message I'm looking at a people who
[2:05:32] desire to go into the
[2:05:36] promises I'm looking at a group of
[2:05:39] people that's Longing To Be
[2:05:42] partakers and
[2:05:44] manifest the thoughts of
[2:05:47] God sir see not Fighters he he let all
[2:05:51] the old Fighters die
[2:05:54] off and when the old Fighters died
[2:05:57] off he took their
[2:06:00] sons raised up among them
[2:06:03] Joshua and sent them over to the full
[2:06:17] PR did not God raise up a prophet Among
[2:06:20] Us
[2:06:24] and the angel of the Lord showed brother
[2:06:28] brandham that his ministry was a Joshua
[2:06:33] Ministry we're not looking for a Joshua
[2:06:35] Ministry to
[2:06:37] come we're not looking for an eighth day
[2:06:41] messenger we're not looking for a man
[2:06:43] with the new
[2:06:45] revelation there's no one that has a new
[2:06:48] revelation that can take us over
[2:06:52] God raised up a prophet in this
[2:06:55] age I ain't going to believe just that
[2:06:58] rhetoric that comes along by some
[2:07:01] Minister I'm going to stand upon the
[2:07:04] message of this
[2:07:07] hour I'll tell you this God didn't waste
[2:07:10] his time by sending us Malachi
[2:07:15] 4 and I ain't wasting my time by
[2:07:18] believing the message of Malachi
[2:07:22] amen can you say
[2:07:24] Amen this message has been
[2:07:27] Vindicated I'm not standing here
[2:07:29] wondering what the prophet
[2:07:32] was I'm not wondering how important his
[2:07:35] message
[2:07:36] was I say that's the Joshua I must
[2:07:41] follow God sent him to take me over into
[2:07:44] the land of PR
[2:08:03] we've had a lot of
[2:08:06] revivals we've had I think what brother
[2:08:08] brandham called proactive
[2:08:10] meetings people get worked up people
[2:08:14] roll on the floor I've seen them do
[2:08:17] flipflops around the
[2:08:19] floor but when the meetings
[2:08:21] over the people's back to where they
[2:08:25] are all that
[2:08:27] preaching all that singing all that
[2:08:30] running
[2:08:31] around it didn't help them they were
[2:08:35] still in a defeated
[2:08:37] situation they were still in the glooms
[2:08:39] and
[2:08:40] doom they were still talking
[2:08:44] defeat they were still saying oh God
[2:08:47] give us Revival give us Revival give us
[2:08:49] Revival
[2:08:51] but a prophet
[2:08:52] came and told us we are that
[2:08:57] Revival the Revival is the Awakening of
[2:09:00] this
[2:09:03] bride amen amen if you want to be
[2:09:06] established in the
[2:09:07] message if you want to be established in
[2:09:11] God believe this
[2:09:13] message if you want to come into the
[2:09:15] realities of the promise believe the
[2:09:18] message if you want to come into the
[2:09:20] reality he had the spoken
[2:09:23] word the
[2:09:33] message see Joshua sent them over to the
[2:09:37] promise that's what this message is God
[2:09:41] said a prophet could take us over into
[2:09:44] the full
[2:09:46] promise that's why we say every promise
[2:09:48] in the book is mine
[2:09:51] chapter every verse every
[2:09:55] last amen I'm not standing on this side
[2:09:58] looking over wonder what belongs to me
[2:10:01] the message has positionally placed me
[2:10:04] in the
[2:10:09] wordo
[2:10:10] [Applause]
[2:10:12] amen he sent him over into the full
[2:10:16] promise so what he done is he sent him
[2:10:19] over into the open of the
[2:10:24] word this new generation saw the
[2:10:28] Giants same Giants that the old
[2:10:34] saw the new generation saw the same old
[2:10:37] world cities at the
[2:10:42] old but they never let that man be
[2:10:45] magnified before
[2:10:48] them they knew they were children of the
[2:10:54] promise
[2:10:56] amen they knew that every giant would
[2:10:59] fall at their
[2:10:59] [Music]
[2:11:01] feet they didn't have to get worked
[2:11:06] up come on Church they didn't have to
[2:11:09] seek for something
[2:11:11] else they didn't need a new
[2:11:13] messenger they believed in the message
[2:11:16] that was given to
[2:11:18] them and by that message
[2:11:21] that giant look like a grasshopper In
[2:11:23] Their
[2:11:29] Eyes by the
[2:11:31] message they saw them W cities fall at
[2:11:34] their feet before it ever
[2:11:41] happen well do you love
[2:11:44] him see the Promise belonged to
[2:11:48] them our brother talked about it today
[2:11:50] the Book of Revelation theth
[2:11:53] chapter there was a
[2:11:56] book that been sealed
[2:11:58] up with Seven
[2:12:01] Seals ain't that right now John was
[2:12:04] caught up over in the Lord's
[2:12:06] day I'm just going to tell you it was
[2:12:08] our
[2:12:10] day the prophet showed that it was our
[2:12:12] day that he was caught up
[2:12:14] in and he's looking at the closed
[2:12:18] book one that sat upon the throne
[2:12:22] had a book in his
[2:12:23] hand sealed with Seven
[2:12:25] Seals and there was a voice that said
[2:12:27] who is
[2:12:29] worth to open and to loose the seals
[2:12:33] thereof and John said I looked around
[2:12:35] but nobody was wor there was no man wor
[2:12:39] Abraham wasn't found wor Moses wasn't
[2:12:42] found wor David wasn't found word Enoch
[2:12:46] wasn't found words there was no man on
[2:12:49] Earth
[2:12:51] No Angel was found worth and John said I
[2:12:55] began to
[2:12:57] weep I mean he
[2:13:01] weep because the brother Bram said the
[2:13:03] reason why he weeped is because if the
[2:13:06] book wasn't open all creation would be
[2:13:11] lost you realize this church if the book
[2:13:15] wasn't open your faith would be in
[2:13:18] vain if the book wasn't open this
[2:13:20] meeting would be in
[2:13:22] vain if the book wasn't open your
[2:13:25] confession would be in
[2:13:27] vain if if somebody didn't open this
[2:13:30] book see this book was the title deed
[2:13:34] of can you say
[2:13:36] amen amen man once had it but he forfeit
[2:13:40] it and it went back to the hands of the
[2:13:43] original
[2:13:45] owner amen and because man didn't have
[2:13:49] it man Liv
[2:13:51] it man was a
[2:13:54] victim man was was a
[2:13:57] sinner oh can you say
[2:14:00] amen he was without
[2:14:02] hope we needed the Redemption book of
[2:14:05] redemption to be
[2:14:08] open and as John began to weep there was
[2:14:11] a voice that said weep not
[2:14:13] John John this is not the time to
[2:14:18] we amen there was going to be something
[2:14:21] scenery was going to
[2:14:22] change the condition was going to
[2:14:26] change the atmosphere of weeping was
[2:14:28] going to
[2:14:30] change can you say Amen we not John
[2:14:34] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:14:38] have
[2:14:39] prevailed he prevailed for you he
[2:14:43] prevailed for me he prevailed over your
[2:14:46] sickness over your sin over your failure
[2:14:51] prevailed over everything that Satan had
[2:14:53] to
[2:15:08] offer can you say amen amen amen but
[2:15:13] notice the Bible says and there stood a
[2:15:15] lamb as it had been
[2:15:17] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[2:15:23] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[2:15:25] forth into all the
[2:15:28] Earth and he came and took the book out
[2:15:30] of the right hand of him that set upon
[2:15:32] the
[2:15:35] throne and when he had taken the
[2:15:38] book notice how the scenery changes now
[2:15:41] the
[2:15:41] atmosphere the four beast and 24
[2:15:44] Elders fell down before the
[2:15:48] lamb having every one of them
[2:15:53] and golden vows full
[2:15:57] ofers which are the prayers of the
[2:16:00] Saints and they sung a new
[2:16:05] song not a song of Doom and
[2:16:07] Gloom not the song of
[2:16:10] traditions not traditional
[2:16:13] singing come on church this was not just
[2:16:17] a traditional church service not on that
[2:16:20] day
[2:16:22] they sang a new
[2:16:25] song The Lamb was able to take the old
[2:16:28] song the
[2:16:31] way can you say
[2:16:34] Amen notice now they sang a new
[2:16:38] song Thou Art
[2:16:41] Worthy now I want to tell you Church the
[2:16:45] days of of of um personalities were over
[2:16:53] the days of man building his own kingdom
[2:16:56] was over on
[2:16:59] Earth the days of man being able to
[2:17:01] glorify himself for before the people
[2:17:04] was over
[2:17:05] there they sang a new
[2:17:09] song th art
[2:17:12] worth this was not man
[2:17:15] worship this was the worship of the Lamb
[2:17:19] the prophet said King L
[2:17:24] worship and I'll just tell you brother
[2:17:26] Braham said it's time for King lamb
[2:17:28] worship
[2:17:32] now can you say
[2:17:34] amen for thou was slain and has redeemed
[2:17:37] us to
[2:17:40] God if you notice they're singing with
[2:17:42] the knowledge
[2:17:44] now they're singing with an
[2:17:46] understanding
[2:17:47] now they Ain sing and learn about their
[2:17:49] problems
[2:17:52] they're not worshiping worrying about
[2:17:53] their
[2:17:56] failures they're now singing a new
[2:17:59] song with the
[2:18:02] Revelation thou H has redeemed us back
[2:18:05] to
[2:18:07] God thou H has by thy blood has made us
[2:18:11] Kings and
[2:18:16] Priests Hallelujah I think that's the
[2:18:19] order of the day it
[2:18:21] that we' quit coming to church worrying
[2:18:23] about things we would quit coming to
[2:18:26] church with their head down we would
[2:18:28] quit coming to church exalting a man and
[2:18:32] we would just give all the glory to God
[2:18:36] because I am now a king and I am a
[2:18:42] priest by th blood Thou made me
[2:18:50] [Music]
[2:18:53] and we shall reain on the
[2:18:56] earth now John was looking at this but
[2:18:59] all of a sudden he come into it
[2:19:04] too you know the prophet said John was
[2:19:07] the type of this last day
[2:19:12] bride now you got to understand that
[2:19:16] John was not a type of the first church
[2:19:19] age he was not a type of the first
[2:19:22] second third fourth fifth sixth Church
[2:19:25] Chas he was a type of
[2:19:29] you and when John saw the book
[2:19:34] open he said all of Heaven heard
[2:19:37] me all creation in the earth the earth
[2:19:42] everyone that had an ear heard I
[2:19:45] Job saying
[2:19:47] blessing
[2:19:49] glory honor
[2:19:51] to the
[2:19:53] lamb can you say Amen his worship was
[2:19:57] directed to the
[2:20:00] lamb because the book had become
[2:20:05] open no more
[2:20:07] crying no more
[2:20:10] weeping no more
[2:20:12] threaten no more woring about his
[2:20:16] future hallu
[2:20:20] he now
[2:20:22] knew he was
[2:20:25] redeemed now the prophet said why did he
[2:20:28] why did John get emotional why did he
[2:20:30] shout
[2:20:32] why he said John must have saw his
[2:20:38] name on the
[2:20:42] bir hallelujah hallelujah
[2:20:47] amen no other age has this book become
[2:20:50] open
[2:20:53] no other age has this been an opening
[2:20:56] book but now that we have come to the
[2:20:59] Jordan
[2:21:00] River God is ready to do a new
[2:21:03] thing and when he got ready to do a new
[2:21:06] thing he wasn't going to bring us to
[2:21:09] another church
[2:21:10] age he wasn't going to bring us to
[2:21:12] another denominational
[2:21:14] age he wasn't just going to bring us to
[2:21:16] another ProTrac of
[2:21:19] Revival he was going to bring us into
[2:21:21] the promised
[2:21:26] land can you say
[2:21:28] Amen the open
[2:21:32] book
[2:21:33] now I can't say or not I don't
[2:21:37] know but it occurred to me I was driving
[2:21:40] down the road one time I think about
[2:21:42] that where brother Brown said John must
[2:21:43] have saw his
[2:21:46] name and I just got to thinking now did
[2:21:49] he just see it
[2:21:52] the first
[2:21:55] page everything was
[2:21:59] blank I don't
[2:22:01] know I just tend to think that John saw
[2:22:06] his name on every
[2:22:10] page every
[2:22:14] promise every promise in the
[2:22:17] book I just happen to believe John saw
[2:22:20] his
[2:22:23] name he knew
[2:22:26] he he knew that salvation was his he
[2:22:30] knew the Rapture was his he knew a body
[2:22:33] change was his he knew
[2:22:37] adoption every promise belong to him
[2:23:00] no wonder he quit
[2:23:07] cry no wonder he started
[2:23:12] rejoicing cuz now he knew he had an
[2:23:16] authority to claim his inheritance
[2:23:25] amen he didn't need to read John
[2:23:30] H to claim his
[2:23:34] inheritance he didn't need to reach some
[2:23:36] author of the book of some other
[2:23:39] book to know what his inheritance
[2:23:42] is God said Propet
[2:23:47] [Applause]
[2:24:01] now you know what this the the prophet
[2:24:04] said when the mighty Angel took the book
[2:24:07] and open the seals
[2:24:10] thereof
[2:24:12] amen I you know the prophet also said
[2:24:16] that Christ was God's love gift
[2:24:21] love
[2:24:24] gift I believe that when he took that
[2:24:27] book now this again just
[2:24:30] me looking into
[2:24:34] it that maybe he looked down and he saw
[2:24:40] people and his heart began to beat for
[2:24:45] them and he thought I can't just keep it
[2:24:47] to it myself
[2:24:50] I got to take it to
[2:24:53] them and God had already promised that
[2:24:56] he would send the prophet
[2:25:00] Malachi and we read in Revelations
[2:25:04] 101 that that Mighty angel came
[2:25:08] down with an open
[2:25:11] book that notice how God orchestrates
[2:25:15] everything the prophet said the seventh
[2:25:17] angel was on the earth at the same time
[2:25:21] of this
[2:25:29] coming because the word always comes to
[2:25:32] a
[2:25:34] prophet now if it was the closed book he
[2:25:37] might have given it to a
[2:25:41] theologian but this was an open
[2:25:44] book this would be a restored word
[2:25:50] the original thoughts of God would be
[2:25:56] unveiled and he gave it to a
[2:26:00] prophet to reveal to his
[2:26:05] people amen amen yes
[2:26:09] sir is this all
[2:26:12] right to reveal to his
[2:26:17] people can you say Amen
[2:26:20] you see now he had the authority to
[2:26:23] claim The
[2:26:25] Inheritance I want to say it this way
[2:26:27] it's not that we just go around claiming
[2:26:29] I claim this and I claim that and I
[2:26:31] claim this and I claim that and I claim
[2:26:35] this we're claiming what's written in
[2:26:38] the
[2:26:40] book under the headship of the
[2:26:45] word now now come on Church we've got
[2:26:48] charismatics back home that claim
[2:26:53] everything I got a family
[2:26:56] member that believes if you in a nice
[2:27:00] house if you ain't driving a nice car if
[2:27:03] you ain't got the nicest things in
[2:27:06] life then you're not
[2:27:14] Sav see it's a perversion of the devil
[2:27:20] come on Church yes you do have an
[2:27:23] authority to
[2:27:26] Acclaim you have an authority to claim
[2:27:28] what's
[2:27:35] yours in the
[2:27:38] book therefore a prophet rightly divided
[2:27:41] the word of Truth
[2:28:00] [Music]
[2:28:04] amen now uh brother Brandon he's he's
[2:28:08] he's in a meeting I'm taking it he's at
[2:28:10] home in in
[2:28:14] Jeffersonville sister Hatty rght is
[2:28:16] sitting in the audience and he has her
[2:28:17] to stand up
[2:28:20] and he says there's the little widow
[2:28:21] woman that the miracle happened on the
[2:28:26] first bypassing all the peoples of the
[2:28:31] world for that thing to happen first to
[2:28:34] that poor little humble widow woman up
[2:28:36] on the
[2:28:40] hillside up there trying to raise a crop
[2:28:42] of corn out of a cross crawfish ground
[2:28:46] out there
[2:28:54] to take care of her
[2:28:56] children that's the one God honored the
[2:28:59] first time since the days of Jesus
[2:29:04] Christ and said ask what you
[2:29:10] will I said I challenge anybody in the
[2:29:12] name of the
[2:29:15] Lord when that Spirit strikes and says
[2:29:19] that
[2:29:22] I don't care what you ask
[2:29:26] for it shall be
[2:29:30] granted
[2:29:32] amen when the spirit strikes like
[2:29:37] that he said now you know why the Pluto
[2:29:41] I guess that's what it's called
[2:29:42] plutocrats didn't get it or the big
[2:29:44] folks like that
[2:29:50] is because God know they had asked
[2:29:53] things that was no good for
[2:29:58] them what more could that woman he said
[2:30:01] what more just tell me anything she
[2:30:04] could ask greater than
[2:30:10] that which was her two
[2:30:13] [Music]
[2:30:14] sons her mother and father is saved
[2:30:21] her little sister sitting in a
[2:30:23] wheelchair was
[2:30:29] saved all the family
[2:30:32] saved except the two boys at that
[2:30:37] time they wasn't
[2:30:39] saved they are poor
[2:30:42] people so they weren't
[2:30:46] Rich they were barely making it
[2:30:51] they are poor
[2:30:52] people he said Shelby told me his
[2:30:55] constant income for good crop he Ned
[2:30:58] $600 a
[2:31:03] year work until the boy is about my age
[2:31:06] and it's all broke down
[2:31:12] everything
[2:31:14] and and working taking care of his daddy
[2:31:17] and mother and they're old and trying to
[2:31:19] take care of his little Afflicted
[2:31:26] sister but he
[2:31:28] saved brother right all of them are
[2:31:33] saved but them too was not
[2:31:36] saved and had he asked the salvation of
[2:31:39] her children long as there is an
[2:31:47] eternity she could have asked for 10,000
[2:31:50] and got
[2:31:53] it she could have asked whatever she
[2:31:57] would but see God knows what you're
[2:32:00] going to ask before he ever places the
[2:32:06] anointing the prophet says he gives it
[2:32:08] to people who he knows will ask the
[2:32:12] right
[2:32:17] thing did you know even James says you
[2:32:19] asked can have not because you ask a
[2:32:24] Miss in other words you ask EV that you
[2:32:26] might bring it upon your own
[2:32:32] lust so there's the charismatics out
[2:32:35] there that's claiming
[2:32:39] everything but they're not under the
[2:32:41] headship of the
[2:32:43] word they're not under the headship of
[2:32:46] the
[2:32:48] promises come on
[2:32:51] chur amen but we're not like the
[2:32:56] charismatics we are the new thing that
[2:33:00] God is
[2:33:05] doing we are the generation that has
[2:33:09] come under the headship of the
[2:33:13] word amen come on
[2:33:16] Church yes the word is in the bride
[2:33:21] yes she has thus say the
[2:33:24] Lord but she stays
[2:33:28] still come on church she keeps still she
[2:33:34] keeps
[2:33:39] quiet until she is told to
[2:33:47] speak amen is this all
[2:33:51] right Hallelujah now I'm going tell you
[2:33:55] a story about my
[2:33:59] wife my first
[2:34:03] wife she had passed
[2:34:07] away but before she had passed
[2:34:12] away she told me she said
[2:34:15] Sean well first of all she came from a
[2:34:17] rough family
[2:34:22] and I don't want to go too off because
[2:34:24] probably online but I don't want to but
[2:34:27] she coming from a really rough
[2:34:33] family
[2:34:38] and uh I I had tried to talk to her mom
[2:34:42] or her dad one time about the
[2:34:46] Lord and it didn't go good
[2:34:50] her mom was claiming to be a Christian
[2:34:51] I'm a
[2:34:54] Christian but just to be honest she was
[2:34:56] a
[2:34:57] [Music]
[2:35:03] heathen and Rebecca she would tell me
[2:35:07] she said
[2:35:09] Sean she said I really want my mom to be
[2:35:13] saved now I'm going to be
[2:35:15] honest I was the D Thomas
[2:35:20] I didn't tell her but in my mind I
[2:35:23] thought there ain't no way that woman
[2:35:24] going to get
[2:35:26] sick was bad to the
[2:35:35] bone but all I would say is
[2:35:39] Rebecca just
[2:35:41] pray so she she would pray for years
[2:35:46] pray one day I was in the living room
[2:35:51] of her home and she was doing some
[2:35:53] laundry in the uh another
[2:35:56] room and I had the take playing perfect
[2:36:00] Faith ever listen perfect
[2:36:05] Faith Church you need to listen to
[2:36:07] perfect
[2:36:10] Faith but I was listening to perfect
[2:36:12] faith and brother Bram just kind talking
[2:36:14] about the promises
[2:36:20] and the spirit of the Lord just dropped
[2:36:21] in that
[2:36:24] place
[2:36:26] amen and Rebecca come out of that room
[2:36:28] come in the living
[2:36:31] room she looked at me and she said
[2:36:34] Sean you believe what brother brandham
[2:36:36] is saying is the
[2:36:38] truth I said you bet it's the
[2:36:42] truth she said well so do
[2:36:45] I she goes back in into doing laundry
[2:36:50] well the tape had finished and I got up
[2:36:52] to go in the
[2:36:55] kitchen and she she came into the
[2:36:59] kitchen we got to
[2:37:02] talking and she said
[2:37:05] Sean the presence of the Lord come into
[2:37:07] that utility
[2:37:08] [Music]
[2:37:10] room I said
[2:37:13] oh she said yeah she said uh something
[2:37:17] happened I said well what was
[2:37:20] it she said oh you you wouldn't believe
[2:37:23] it I said well tell me what what
[2:37:26] happened and she said well oh it's
[2:37:30] nothing I said all right what
[2:37:36] happened she said well Sean believe it
[2:37:38] or
[2:37:39] not when the presence of the Lord come
[2:37:42] down she said I heard myself
[2:37:47] say I send the Holy Ghost after my
[2:37:50] mother but she said Sean it wasn't
[2:37:53] me she said something got a hold
[2:37:58] of and she said I heard myself
[2:38:02] speak I send the Holy Ghost after my
[2:38:06] mother now her mama didn't talk to us
[2:38:09] didn't talk to
[2:38:11] her and so they didn't have much of
[2:38:13] relationship because of our

[2:43:14] people and we are the people of the open
[2:43:17] book
[2:43:21] we are the children of
[2:43:24] promise I don't care what the enemy
[2:43:27] looks
[2:43:29] like I don't care what the opposition's
[2:43:33] like I don't care how many failures I
[2:43:37] have I'm not looking at the
[2:43:41] giant I'm looking at a
[2:43:44] promise and God said I'm an overcomer
[2:43:49] God said I'm
[2:43:51] Victorious God said I'm his
[2:43:54] child and I claim it in the name of the

[2:45:12] word every devil has to fall under your
[2:45:15] feet

[2:45:53] land we ain't woring about false
[2:45:56] doctrines we ain't looking for some new
[2:46:00] agenda we're satisfied with the end time

[2:46:09] leader we are the Caleb of this
[2:46:12] age we're binding ourselves to

[2:46:37] Journey from Egypt to the promised
[2:46:41] land he fed a
[2:46:44] Mana but he told them don't keep that
[2:46:47] manner
[2:46:49] don't keep it for the next
[2:46:51] day and those who did found out that
[2:46:54] that man became
[2:46:58] wormy can you say
[2:47:00] Amen but notice when they come into the
[2:47:03] promised
[2:47:04] land they no longer were eating the

[2:50:51] now look John in Revelations
[2:50:57] 10:8 now he was told to eat the
[2:51:01] book but what was it it was an open
[2:51:05] book he was not eating a clothes
[2:51:11] book he was eating the very thing that
[2:51:15] the seventh angel was given
[2:51:22] so he wasn't bypassing the seventh
[2:51:26] angel the seventh angel had already had
[2:51:29] the
[2:51:31] book now John was to eat that
[2:51:38] book so he was digesting what the
[2:51:41] seventh angel
[2:51:46] had and when he ate it
[2:51:49] he was told to
[2:51:53] prophesy I believe that prophecy was
[2:51:56] none other than a
[2:52:00] confession what the prophet taught he
[2:52:03] was to
[2:52:06] teach what the prophet understood he was
[2:52:09] to
[2:52:10] [Music]
[2:52:12] understand the same spirit that inspired
[2:52:14] the prophet was to inspire him
[2:52:19] the spirit and the bride and the prophet
[2:52:22] will be saing the same
[2:52:30] thing
[2:52:32] amen amen the word is in the
[2:52:35] bride can you say that with me the word
[2:52:38] is in the

[2:52:52] hallelu sir Hallelujah he wasn't eating
[2:52:54] the book that the other ages
[2:52:57] ate they were eating from a close
[2:53:02] book but he had a different
[2:53:05] diet he was not eating partial truth
[2:53:08] mixed with everything else that man put
[2:53:10] in
[2:53:15] it he wasn't eating something that was
[2:53:18] with men's
[2:53:22] ideas a prophet did not preach his own
[2:53:26] opinion he had that sayth the
[2:53:31] Lord
[2:53:34] amen and whatever somebody else says
[2:53:36] well that's his opinion well I'll tell
[2:53:38] you like it's always been said I'll take
[2:53:40] his opinion in day over yours over mine
[2:53:45] over anybody's I'll take a prophet's
[2:53:47] opinion
[2:53:50] can you
[2:53:51] say and I am ashamed of what a prophet
[2:53:55] said see so what he done is he ate the
[2:53:59] original
[2:54:03] word the thoughts that God had before
[2:54:06] the foundation of the world John was
[2:54:08] feasting on
[2:54:13] it can you say
[2:54:15] Amen yes sir see man so we don't want to
[2:54:19] bring in Old mana and feed you with
[2:54:24] that we don't want to we don't want to
[2:54:26] feed off other ideas about
[2:54:29] things but God has done a new
[2:54:32] thing he's doing a new
[2:54:35] thing come on church but you are a
[2:54:39] chosen
[2:54:41] generation a royal

[2:55:27] known to
[2:55:29] us and are being manifested in
[2:55:32] us can I say you we are the
[2:55:36] book we are the
[2:55:39] book this book is taken on
[2:55:43] flesh I'm tired of reflecting man's
[2:55:46] ideas
[2:55:48] I'm tired of reflecting my
[2:55:52] denominations tired I'm tired of
[2:55:54] reflecting Creeds and
[2:55:57] darkness come on
[2:55:59] church God has created us to reflect the
[2:56:04] original
[2:56:05] word what God had in his mind is now
[2:56:09] being made manifest
[2:56:16] [Applause]
[2:56:17] [Music]
[2:56:20] en
[2:56:22] closing Jesus yes was the manifestation
[2:56:26] of the word of
[2:56:28] God the prophet said he was a man of a
[2:56:30] predestinated seat of
[2:56:34] God now Jesus knew who he
[2:56:38] was because he saw himself in the
[2:56:42] book you believe that he had a
[2:56:46] revelation
[2:56:48] he was not just reading about things
[2:56:50] that pertain to Messiah and says well I
[2:56:52] wonder who that
[2:56:56] is but he could read it and say that
[2:56:58] speaks of
[2:57:03] me he he could read it and say this day
[2:57:07] this scripture is being
[2:57:13] fulfilled but the prophet said Satan
[2:57:15] knew the word too
[2:57:21] hello the prophet said he knowed it from
[2:57:23] A to
[2:57:27] Z but Jesus knew the
[2:57:31] word in a different way than Satan
[2:57:37] did Brother Braham said Satan can
[2:57:39] impersonate any kind of gift that God's
[2:57:41] got but he cannot bring that word word
[2:57:43] by word
[2:57:51] in another place he said he know the
[2:57:52] word when he come to
[2:57:57] Eve but he had it by head
[2:58:02] knowledge and it wouldn't
[2:58:04] work he came to Jesus quoting
[2:58:09] scripture he could quote scripture but
[2:58:11] he couldn't place the
[2:58:15] scriptures he knew the word he could
[2:58:17] quote the word
[2:58:20] but he couldn't rightly divide the
[2:58:25] word but Jesus knew the word
[2:58:34] differently
[2:58:36] amen uhuh well do you love it so now
[2:58:40] notice how did he know the word the
[2:58:42] prophet said he knew it by
[2:58:44] faith in the revelation of God's word in
[2:58:47] his own predestinated
[2:58:54] life he said Glory I hope that soaks
[2:58:56] Plumb into your
[2:58:58] heart Jesus knew who he
[2:59:02] was Satan was
[2:59:08] wondering Jesus knew that he was a
[2:59:10] predestinated creature of
[2:59:16] God that God himself was manifested in
[2:59:20] him it wasn't him doing the
[2:59:24] works it was the father that dwelt in
[2:59:28] him he said let the devil fly with all
[2:59:31] of his
[2:59:34] theology see Satan knew
[2:59:36] it he knew the
[2:59:39] word he could quote that scripture
[2:59:42] boy just like a walk in
[2:59:45] Bible he could just quote it like that
[2:59:49] but Jesus just stood
[2:59:52] still for he knew where he was
[2:59:57] standing he know that he was
[3:00:01] predestinated that he was the lamb slain
[3:00:04] before the foundation of the
[3:00:07] world he know that he was that
[3:00:11] person he know that he was predestinated
[3:00:14] for that and that's the way he knew the
[3:00:23] word can you say Amen now I want to ask
[3:00:26] you we've had this Bible for
[3:00:30] years we've had men teaching this word
[3:00:32] for
[3:00:34] years that What Makes You

[3:00:41] different is the way we know this
