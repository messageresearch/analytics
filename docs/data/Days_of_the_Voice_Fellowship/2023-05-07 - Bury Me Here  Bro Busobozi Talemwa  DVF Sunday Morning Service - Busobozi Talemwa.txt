I got saved among the Pentecostals in 83. no yeah and the message I received the revelation of the message in 86. [Music] from 87 I have been a minister of this message [Music] most of the churches in Western Uganda and in mubende I started them so what you have is the truth stand on that because it is the message of the bridegroom is the voice of the bridegroom if the Lord I will come also one time and minister to you but may the Lord bless you with those few words I mean I mean amen I wanted to do that because in in the Traditions you are not supposed to shake the hand of your mother in law but in Christ oh we are very free in Christ we are very free we can share a room with him he's not only my father-in-law is my brother she says amen amen so God bless you uh I noticed I forgot to tell you this when I went to Zimbabwe I met this young man his name is Martin shumba and he writes music and he sings it and Records it I think that's recording so he he gave me these cities as souvenirs us and you know these cities now they have being phased out I see this weather it's being face down so but some of you who still have a way to access uh a CD player named MP3 player please see me after church so I give you I have about seven so the first ones are the ones I will give oh so when they are servicing a wedding uh so I went to Zimbabwe I got friends I brought you the food some friendship is a very good young man he loves the Lord amen amen and uh also I wanted to let the church know that I've been invited to Germany for some meetings there it's called the Pentecostal uh 25th there 25th 25th Pentecostal anniversary meetings so uh I will be I will be going there in so I'm sure that our so those ones are from the USA America and the meetings are in Germany they're hosted by a very old brother his name is brother God Rodwell those brothers are I should say the elders in this message so uh it's my privilege to go and join in with them in those meetings pray with me um I'm still around but I'll be going around the end of this month praise the Lord amen so you know when we travel when you go to tambula we don't only go to preach they together we've got to make friends near together we go to uh to to see the bride in another area we've got to get experiences we've got to be encouraged together on my recent trip in South Africa and Zimbabwe I was really encouraged but again that is Zimbabwe in South Africa very encouraged spiritually so I know I would be encouraged so much when I go this time to Germany man and of course when I'm encouraged then I come back to encourage you that's the end goal yeah so shall we now stand and go to the world so we are going to read from the book of job I got an inspiration for this what I'm going to preach today to you uh when I was in the city of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe is for what I'm going to preach today um so I thought we had agreed by the margin that I will not be interpreted today but I don't know okay is there anybody who must heal Uganda yeah okay her name is foreign if I feel you need an interpreter then I'll call him so Brother Martin be on standby so we are going to read a job Chapter 19 Verse 25. actually without an interpreter I'll even be faster and I trust uh did I say chapter 25 I meant chapter 19. my sister here I want to say you are welcome God bless you I'm happy to see you feel free in the house of the Lord amen uh someone is clapping because of our sister feel free to clap and welcome her also amen we love visitors and we love we love new faces okay verses 25 uh we are going to read up to verses 26 just two verses and then we shall be seated after prayer Okay so for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroyed this body yet in my flesh shall I see God shall we pray Lord Jesus we have read a portion of your holy word this morning and we ask you Lord to just come now and give us inspiration give me inspiration Lord as I speak give me utterance and even the people Lord that Inspire them to receive these words as it is meant for them to receive you today granted Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you see sometimes when we are praying uh to receive an inspiration from the Holy Spirit on what to preach about I don't just go to read oh I don't just go to study in the Bible or in the message on what to preach to you many times I've realized that when I I want to seek the inspiration of the Holy Spirit on what to preach about I just wait I wait upon him it's not only for this place for any other place I've been to I wait upon him and many times even when I went to Zimbabwe I had prepared a lot of summons that I I was going to preach but in almost each service the Holy Spirit gave me a different inspiration and I picked it up and preached it to them and maybe a new inspiration for them but this morning even for last Sunday and even this Sunday there is a thought that has been going on in my heart and I wanted to share it with you on the open door but somehow you see the Holy Spirit has not inspired me to go that direction and so last night as I was pondering and seeing whether to go that direction or this other direction then he brought in this inspiration again and this is what I'm going to talk about bury me here bothering me here and so tell your neighbor bury me here aha I hold your Uganda ah Pastor you're going to talk about body yes I'm going to talk about barringo some people fear death and some people fear by you and others when you talk about barrier they already feel their body tingling because they don't want to die or when they see a dead body they feel like oh this is the end of the world and they get sick some of them get sick some of them can't eat food for a while but I am so thankful that a Believer will die once and we cannot die the second time we die once and when the moment we we die and we are buried in the place I want to tell you today we can never die again and we can never be buried in any other place again the only place that the only thing that is remaining for us or for a Believer is resurrection now there are many things that people are being buried in today there are many many things in the world that the devil his purpose is to bury us in many different things and this reminds me what we uh brother Marvin shared on Friday with us who are not here on Friday you missed a great deal but I'm having shared a very powerful sermon a very powerful inspiration that God gave him and it was a blessing to us how many we are blessed on Friday night Amen Let us give a crap of praise to the Lord for that uh brother Marvin was a doctor last Friday uh yeah this Friday he was a doctor and he was examining our hearts you see and really God dealt with us very very well and we appreciate God for that but today after our hearts are examined we are talking about barriers so because if our hearts are examine and maybe we are dead then we have to be buried but in this case it's not a bad death it's a good death because the bad things are dying and the good things are leaving of course when you die there is a resurrection and many people when they get sick the first thing that they will fear is death ah what if I die but here is a man called job and job was a very wealthy man job was a very blessed man Joe body found the blessing of God found the grace of God in his life praise the name of the Lord where is Brother Martin okay call him up here to come and interpret the Holy Spirit told me there are about three people that must be interpreted here today and so I don't want to disobey the Holy Spirit aha but the matter I told you to be near so uh-huh so I'm going to wait for you now praise the name of the Lord how many love the Lord this morning all right so I've just obeyed the Holy Spirit don't feel bad about me here there are some people when they hear about death they feel bad but here is a man who was sick this man knew he was going to die again that this sickness was taking him to his grave and he had complained to God until he gave up and now his friends were telling him maybe you were a sinner a sacred sinner but you see this man was a seed of God let me tell you something about a seed a seed of God he can never die you can try to bury the seed of God in many things and the seed of God always shoots up afterwards a seed of God can never die a seed of God the moment we are born the devil always envisions to bury us into the things of the world the things that decay some of you we are battered in those things the purpose of the devil was to do that to bother you in this school to bother you in alcohol to bother you in the things that are in this world the Bible summarizes into the three things the last of the flesh the pride of life and the last of the eyes see the Bible summarizes all the things in the world under those three things in the Book of Genesis the devil tried to bury the Adam and Eve in those things you remember when Saturn came to Eve and he told her all those three things is good for the flesh is good for the eyes and so the devil was trying to buy the heart in the last of the Flesh in the pride of life in the last of the eyes when Jesus came on the scene yes we are they never knew and Jesus was a city yes do you know that Jesus the devil could not lava [Applause] for now that's the last of the eyes Jesus yes was supposed to die on the cross in order for him to have all the kingdoms of the world they never knew that he had to go through suffering he had to go through self-sacrifice and then to die and get everything but the devil come to him before he died before he went to the crossbow to me for just one second and I'll give you everything the lust of the eyes see the devil tried to bother Jesus but Jesus refused Jesus could not yes we are gone because he was The Incorruptible sin [Applause] how many times Millennium has never tried to bury us but why are you here this morning because the devil cannot bury you in those things he can try us when he cannot bother you in those days because you have a seed of God in you that seed can never die yes amen Jesus refused to be buried nothing yes all right I will take you he took him right now and he told him look I want you to fly Okay jump ER doesn't the Bible say Bible that he will send his angels that you will not even allow your feet did you hear that scripture that the devil quoted um and Jesus knew yes that is true but not when it is coming out of the Devil's Mouth that the devil tells you out there are actually true but it is a trap to destroy you somewhere and Jesus understood that and they said you are trying to trap me in other words Jesus Saturn was telling us Jesus do you know you can fly or why don't you money you know I am imagining right now in my imagination you know riding it writing and then they put their feet on the around I don't know how they call it and then he begins to to like going down the lane I Can Fly wants to substitute with a true bearing place foreign you have to say Amen if you want me to preach to you today so now yeah the devil wants to substitute with another batting place I could take a water he wants to take you out there why are you feel like the world is on top it is below you what will it answer see anyone see you and you are on top of the world and you are ruling and again and you are the king oh you are the queen of a child everything is below you want to feel the vibe that is the pride of life and Jesus told Jesus you can fly and you will not hurt yourself if Jesus fly yes he would have hurt himself amen but Jesus was it wise because he had that seed of God in him to me and I've tried to convince you begin to fly okay to fly with them I don't care how many will fly Obama with the offerings of the devil here is what I know and I want to tell you this morning I want to announce it to you there is a group of people that have a seed of God in them and these people are all over the world everywhere they are in America they're in Europe they can never accept to fly with the devil because they will realize that's the wrong place I'm interview some of us were about it there but to prove that we are seeds you are here today you are here today oh why because you are saved they never wanted to bother you use it in the pride of life [Music] to have the vibe to be happy with everybody else but you realize comes from the Lord you believe he is you believe he is because we believe God is not a favor God is a reality God is a living God foreign [Applause] but you haven't received an experience with God yet and here is another thing but the devil gives you come to Jesus and he told him now if everything fails let us talk about your flesh this is this flesh also has needs it is the example we see is the devil told Jesus I can see your flesh is hungry um so your body can feel good did you hear that and the devils are just the same thing to ask in our generation do this so that your body can feel good go and drink alcohol so your body can feel excited go and smoke so the body can be excited brother how old are you uh 19. and you don't have a girlfriend and let your flesh be excited excite your flesh foreign this flesh whether you're a Believer for 40 years the flesh is not born again I'm preaching again the flesh is not born again the flesh doesn't have the Holy Ghost the flesh has no experience with God your flesh is the flesh [Music] listen to me Jesus was God yes in the flesh was tempted with the last of the flesh one thing the devil was with him the devil was speaking David [Applause] [Applause] doubt he only saw a woman bathing and the devil told him you see you can make your body happy this man was a king this man had more than one wife [Music] foreign [Music] that's the last of the flesh foreign and the women are taking the leader did you know that these days there's men leaving the homes foreign what is happening the woman left her place as a woman and she has taken the place of a man that's why they even wear trousers that is how it started the people thought it was just about dressing but God sent a prophet his name is William Branham William this Prophet told us that was an immoral spirit that makes a woman dress like that she wants to take the place of a man women want to be men now to begin with as a woman get there because it was hard that started the relationship um foreign foreign hi babe hi babe Hi Sam and when that moment that thing happens you have to open your eyes quickly and Escape these days it is that we will ask to kiss boys please let me talk about this it is the young ladies can you please kiss me oh yeah foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] amen and while in your situation your condition like Jesus yes he denied the devil yes if you are the devil is trying to trap you and bother you there brother the Bible says do what together and then watch that first begin to show its true colors brother the devil will flee from you Satan sister the devil will flee from you don't have time for the devil young people have time for the devil we never say they will not try he is

feel that way you can be able to say I know my redeemer lives I know my redeemer lives he brings them back again I see that his feet some of them very big government people others very educated people

it to us on the screen if you can and others can follow there and Abraham stood up from before his dead and Speck Unto the Sons of Health saying I am a stranger will you give me a possession of a budding place with you that I may bury my dead out of my my sight and the children of Health answer that Abraham saying unto him hear us my Lord thou art a mighty Prince Among Us in the choice of all sepulchers bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee he said power but thou mayest that thou but that thou mayest bury thy day stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even only with them saying if it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entreat me for to Ephron the son of Zohar that he may give me the cave of macpella which he has which he has which is in the end of this of his field for as much money as it is worth He Shall give it to me for a possession and a bearing place amongst you and if from dwelt among the children of health and if from the heated answered Abraham in the audience of each of the children of Health even of all that went in at the Gate of his City saying name my Lord hear me the few would give I Thee and the cave that there is that is therein I give it thee in the presence of that of the sons of my people give I give I eat thee but it I did and Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land and the spec under Ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou would give it I pray thee hear me I will give thee money for the field take it of of me and I will bury my dead there and

they think the Milestone is far-fetched [Music] I want to encourage you it's not always how much we can give us how much we are determined and God says that is our incomes and he's able to start from where we will stop where we cannot continue he can start from there but where each of you who is hearing me and understanding what I'm saying um yes to have some money with you okay to give to this bank make it a commitment in your heart for us we shall continue to announce it on a weekly foreign [Music] for our land funds to be able to achieve our goals for those of you who thought that the goal is unachievable I'm I'm I want to tell you that goal is achievable to buy our own Churchland [Music] foreign if you're doubting that sacrifices it's better not to pledge anything than to tell the Lord in your heart it is better not to pledge than to say that not every heart every Sunday I'm going to give a hundred thousands and they don't give nothing even God detests that God does not love that so friends if you've played it may not be a lot of money but whatever you have pledge please fulfill your pledges this is one way of giving another way of giving is through the pledges you can pledge every matter I'll do this every week I will do this and let us do this with one heart yeah it's all about how much money but the unity we have and the faith that you need to have towards the Bible says if two if every week how much do we have now in the land fund brother and I want to see it increasing every week from the first day of our pledges myself and my wife plagued an amount every month we've had a lot of financial challenges but there is no man that has passed Maybe see my wife my wife text her pledged from her budget her monthly budget please and she told media if I have to feed you beans and she pledged 200 000 every month I don't know how she squeezes it out of there I'm still feeding us at home but it's a sacrifice so you you saved and you bought a phone of 450 out of your foreign [Music] I'm telling you members of my family member of family so you can know that this is the sacrifice and I hope that each of us could catch the vision you know how many saw the newsletter I gave um how many I've been able to say that PDF with pictures on my mission trip yeah one person there with my mission trip to Zimbabwe how many saw it those of you who have not seen it I presume you are not online [Music] but uh uh some of you might have seen it on my status I posted a picture of a church one of the church is not the only church but one of the churches in Zimbabwe Church he's not even believing it it is three thousand seater yeah I preached in that church the second time this on this trip in the first was in 2011. whenever I go there I'm challenged that church was built at a time of a Great Recession in Zimbabwe but those Believers with resilience collected money they collected money and they built now we can do it we can do it but we need Oneness we need Unity we need Vision I was even telling the brother we need even to go on radio broadcast [Music] actually by God's grace I'm going to start a radio program uh it's a lot of money I think I said 30 minutes only 250 000. that's the cheapest we could find with a good audience at that's how much 2 million one million yeah one million um so one million Shillings on Twitter that program starts well not if but when the program starts we need one million every month to reach out to the souls with about this message of the hour which you have received me I am focused I am determined I know what I'm doing but you need to catch the vision we need to support the vision and then God will prosper you is not a problem to God see we don't pull for money in this church you have to put on your heart say Lord I'm going to give oh you know and he will give it to you to give it amen amen if we were in some of those churches we would not saying raise your heart God is about to bless you now touch your
