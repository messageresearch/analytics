And we thank God certainly for this time because it is a wonderful thing for us to be in the presence of God. Praise the Lord. We are going to share something as the Lord will lead. Pastor requested me to stand in because he's not around with us. But we surely thank God for everything. continue praying for him wherever he is that the Lord will use him wherever he is. Praise the Lord. We don't open from the Bible the book of John chapter 8 verse 36. Praise the Lord. Uh John chapter 8 verse 36. I pray the Lord helps us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just going to read only verse one. If the son therefore shall make you free, he shall be free indeed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Dear heaven, most precious loving God, as we approach the throne of mercy, I pray the Lord Jesus that you come and take over, Lord, use this lips, oh, Father, take away everything in it, Lord, that may hinder your word to come out. that your children may be blessed &gt;&gt; that we may return out of this place with a change heart desire to be with you in the service and be with our pastor as well Lord Jesus we commit those who are following online Jesus may please be with them anoint them receive their portion in this service I pray let thy presence come and take over in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ. Let us sit. Praise the Lord. So we are going to share something here brief as the Lord will lead us. Uh we have read from the book of uh John 8:36. The Bible says that if the son therefore shall make you free, yes shall be free indeed. And we are sharing our heading that we are sharing a topic whatever you may call it. A season of freedom. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The season of freedom usually comes after you have gone through a a life of bondage. Meaning there's something which should have tied you. But you would have been desiring to have freedom. But the Bible tells us here, "If the son therefore shall make you free, it is indeed that you're free." It is not a joke. It is not a play as long as you believe it. I say amen to the word of God. Indeed, you'll be free. Praise the Lord. There are there are yolks of bondage that we may share a few of them today. Maybe you can read some of them. A common scripture in the book of Galatians chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Galatians chapter 5 and verses uh 19 to 21 something that we commonly read. But I want us read also now. Praise the Lord. Now the works of the flesh are manifest which are this adultery, &gt;&gt; fornication, uncleanness, lasness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, sed seditions, heresies, uh envy, M mur drunkardness, revilings, and such like of which I tell you before, as also I told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. It simply means that when you do these things here, you are still in bondage. Therefore, you need freedom. Freedom from all these things that the Bible has counted. You need freedom from fornication. You need freedom from uncleanness. You need freedom from living a life of hatred, living a life of strife. You need freedom from murder or drunkenness and many more other things of such because for you to get freedom there must be bondage. And after bondage when you desire if the Lord when you desire freedom, God will come and set you free. Reverend, &gt;&gt; there's need for you to know what your your true freedom is. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we live like we are free yet we are not free. Each one of us can tell that indeed I'm not free from this point here. There's need for you to know the true freedom that we are talking about which the Bible tells tells I yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity and to iniquity. Praise the Lord. EVEN SO NOW YIELD YOUR MEMBERS SERVANTS TO RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TO HOLINESS. For here were the servants of sin. Here were here were free from righteousness. MEANING THAT IN THE OLD OLD man we lived a life of sin without any righteousness. We are not free at all. Every time we lived a life of guilt. Meaning the only man was having dominion. HE WAS having control over you. HE WAS CONTROLLING each and every ONE OF US. WE NEVER HAD A FREEDOM. EVEN SOMETIME WHEN WE SEEMED FREE for sure we're NOT FREE UNTIL CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS THAT YOU ARE SET FREE UNTIL THAT TIME WHEN YOU ARE TOLD THAT CHRIST DIED on the cross for your sins and you believed him. YOU GAVE YOUR LIFE to Christ. YOU ARE BAPTIZED. NOW YOU ARE SET FREE. BROTHER YOU NEED TO BE FREE INDEED. THAT IDENTITY OF FREEDOM MUST BE IDENTIFIED WITH YOU, MEANING THAT it's no longer struggling to be free, but you're free indeed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; For when you ARE SERVANTS OF SERVANTS OF SIN, you have free from righteousness. Verse 21 says that what fruits hast then in those things whereof here are now ashamed for the end for the end of those things death but now being made free from sin and become servants of God to God. Yeah. Have your fruit unto holiness and the everlasting life. I mean and the end everlasting life. It simply means that you have passed from sin to life. Now you are just living this life on this world simply to serve God in freedom. But even after this life there must be freedom IN CHRIST. WHERE GOD WILL WELCOME YOU AND SAY WELL done my servant then you have done all that which is right when you are here on earth Christ will no longer count that which you committed by mistake Christ will not count that which you committed which you committed by mistake it was all it was all put under grace and Christ set you free. Praise the Lord. Now, what is true freedom? True freedom is ability to say no to the works of the devil. When the DEVIL WHEN THE DEVIL TELLS YOU do this, you have a right to say no. That is a true freedom we are talking about. It is also ability to exercise that which you have received from Christ. and obey him all the time. Praise the Lord. The ability to exercise that which YOU HAVE RECEIVED THAT YOU HAVE FREEDOM, you have power, YOU HAVE AUTHORITY TO SPEAK TO EVERY SPIRIT which may come lingering AND NEAR YOU AND TELL IT BEHIND ME SATAN. SATAN DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER YOU TO GO BEFORE YOU. THE SPIRIT OF THE DEVIL MUST ALWAYS GO BEHIND YOU TRYING TO PEEP WHAT TO DO. BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE ROOTED in Christ, you have ability to speak. YOU HAVE AUTHORITY TO SPEAK AND EVERY SPIRIT WILL BOW DOWN AND SAY YES SIR AND YOU CONTINUE YOUR HEAD. Praise God. Praise the Lord. WHEN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST was tempted after his prayer and fasting, he had authority of the word. He had the ability to exercise the WORD BECAUSE IT WAS in him. NOW THAT CHRIST is in you, you too has AN ABILITY TO EXERCISE the freedom that Christ has GIVEN YOU. THAT FREEDOM IS YOU AS BROTHERS. RECEIVE IT EVEN NOW AND GO out there AND EXERCISE IT. PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT is true freedom? &gt;&gt; IS HAVING TRUE FUNCTIONALITY OF YOUR TRUE potential in Christ. MEANING THAT EVERYTHING IN YOU FUNCTIONS LIKE CHRIST IS IN YOU. The members OF YOUR BODY ARE BEING USED TO SERVE GOD, NOT TO EXERCISE EVIL. NOW THEY ARE FUNCTIONING to serve GOD TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. TO DO WHAT IS THE WILL OF GOD. THEY ALL FUNCTIONING towards serving God. Brethren, whatever we do, whether I go to school, whether I go to home, whether I'm with friends, whe I'm at the workplace, THE FUNCTIONALITY OF YOUR TRUE FREEDOM must be exercised. You should not exercise only when you're in church. YOU SHOULD EXERCISE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE. WHERE YOU TELL A FRIEND IN ME are of Christ these things are just easier to deal with AND EVERYTHING WILL BE SORTED. PRAISE THE LORD. MEANING THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF YOUR TRUE POTENTIAL in Christ is now working and that is true freedom. I'm talking about what IS TRUE FREEDOM. TRUE FREEDOM IS TO HAVE AN opportunity ask whatsoever you desire whereby WHEN YOU HAVE FREEDOM. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO CHRIST. TELL CHRIST YOUR SERVANT is I need a job BECAUSE YOU HAVE TRUE FREEDOM IN YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SIN WHICH IS LINGERING AROUND YOU. THAT TRUE FREEDOM GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET WHATSOEVER you desire from God because you are free. Ask whatsoever you want and it shall be given. Knock and it will be OPEN FOR YOU. SEEK AND YOU'LL FIND IT. PRAISE THE LORD simply because one day Christ came to you. He was knocking your heart and YOU OPENED IT. NOW CHRIST IS IN YOU. YOU HAVE TRUE FREEDOM TO GO AND GET WHATSOEVER YOU DESIRE FROM HIM. BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT FREEDOM. It is now you TO GO TO HIM AND TELL HIM, "FATHER, I need a job. Father, I need this AND THAT." BECAUSE YOU ALLOWED HIM IN YOU. NOW THAT IS IN YOU AND YOU HAVE THE TRUE FREEDOM. YOU HAVE ALSO OPPORTUNITY AS A CHILD OF GOD TO GO AND GET WHATSOEVER YOU DESIRE. PRAISE THE LORD. JESUS KNOCKED AT YOUR door and you are able to open FOR HIM. NOW IS LIVING IN YOUR heart your true freedom. Leave us for Christ not as children of the world. Exercise your freedom sister brother. Wherever you go, DO NOT LIMIT THE FREEDOM THAT CHRIST HAS GIVEN to us. Christ has given us freedom without any PRICE TO PAY. WE SIMPLY SUBMIT ourselves to him. Praise the Lord and he will BE WITH US. NOW IF YOU know if you have you have known a true freedom then you own it all. Galatians chapter 5 and verse one. Praise the Lord. Are we together? That is great. Galatians chapter 5. Just verse one. Here the Bible says that stand first therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Paul says here, "Stand fast, therefore." And he says that in the liberty WHEREWITH CHRIST HAS MADE US FREE. That is the kind of liberty that Christ has given you. PAUL IS JUST TRYING TO ENCOURAGE US here that we need to stand fast in that liberty, not hiding our freedom. Praise the Lord. Praise God. That is a freedom that God has given unto us that we need to stand in there for. PRAISE THE LORD. USE YOUR FREEDOM to love God, to love others, not to hate people. not to backbite people, not to be against your brother. Let that freedom be to serve God. Colossians chapter 5 verse 13. The Bible says for brethren, ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. But by love serve one another. Don't use your liberty that you have to speak against your brother who's weak, but instead use that liberty THAT YOU HAVE, THAT FREEDOM that you have to pray for your brother. Not because you're not you're not committing adultery and you're seeing the other IS COMMITTING ADULTERY. SO YOU USE THAT FREEDOM TO SPEAK AGAINST THE OTHER. No brother, that is not the way to do it. Whether he's a believer, you have to love them. BECAUSE THAT FREEDOM that you have, when you really exercise it freely, it will identify Christ to those neighbors of yours. If they hate you, they will come to understand that the person this person has inside him seems like there's something different. You see the way he behaves, even when we talk about against him, even when we talk about against him. Yesterday we beat the other day we beat his child but he didn't act roughly. The person was just gentle because you have the true freedom in Christ. use it to love others, not to hate people. Verse 15 says that, "But if bite and devour one another, take heed that he be not consumed of one another, I say then, walk in the spirit, and he shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh, lust of the flesh, Brother, sister, true freedom is connected to having a spirit of God in you that you may not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Because if you come this freedom, there will come a point when you cannot exercise it. When you're squeezed, when you're tried, when people catch you when they desire to do whatever they want, you can't exercise that freedom. But let that freedom be exercised in a way of Steven. When he was being stoned, HE DID NOT SAY, "YOU FOOLS, WHY ARE YOU STONING ME?" BUT HE WAS JUST PRAYING for them. He was exercising the freedom that he had IN CHRIST. HE WAS NOT USING IT AGAINST PEOPLE. PRAISE THE LORD. BUT IF YOU HAVE A FREEDOM WHICH IS CREATED BY YOU, WHEN SUCH TIME COMES, brother sister, you cannot stand it. You'll simply fall away. FOR THE FLESH lusteth against the spirit, AND EVEN THE SPIRIT VICE vers to the one to the other, so that he cannot do the things that you would. All this true freedom you have tal we have talked about you cannot exercise them because if you live in the flesh and you lust after the things of the flesh YOU ARE AGAINST THE SPIRIT. Therefore brother you have NO AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE this true freedom and it needs you to yield to the spirit and when the spirit has control over you'll be therefore to be against the flesh. AND A FLESH WILL NEVER HAVE CONTROL over you. Praise the Lord. That is a true identity of true freedom. Praise the Lord. We are sharing the season of freedom. I hope this season of freedom will come upon you that indeed come upon you that you may find Christ. Rise aloud. We want to see something here in verse chapter 2 of uh 2 Corinthians. Chapter 3 verse 17. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Are we alive? Are we together? Are we free in Christ? IF WE ARE FREE, LET'S THANK the Lord. Praise the Lord. AND IF YOU'RE [screaming] NOT FREE, GOD WILL SET YOU FREE BECAUSE FREEDOM IS YOURS BY YOU COMING TO CHURCH, YOU DESIRE FREEDOM. THEREFORE, YOU MUST GO BACK FREE. EVERY SPIRIT MUST BE bound and must remain wherever it goes. But for you, you must go back free. Praise the Lord. 1 Corinthians chapter 3:1 17 that freedom brother sister must be identical in the children of God you must exercise it with it is fullness do not limit God when sickness comes all the time you want to identify yourself with the hospital but there must be a time Should I then exercise your freedom and speak TO THE SPIRIT OVER ANY KIND OF SICKNESS that you have no RIGHT OVER ME? THEREFORE, depart away from my body. FOR THIS BODY IS A TEMPLE OF GOD. I AM FREE. Praise the Lord. That is the kind of freedom we desire, brethren. Not freedom of camouflage. Should be a reality. True freedom in Christ. Praise the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:1 17. &gt;&gt; Now the Lord is a is that spirit. And where the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. In the Bible, Jesus moved to different places. &gt;&gt; But wherever Christ reached, liberty must come TO THAT PLACE. FREEDOM MUST COME TO THAT PLACE. HEALING MUST COME TO THAT PLACE. Rising people from the dead must COME TO THAT PLACE. NO problem must come TO THAT PLACE BECAUSE CHRIST HAS REACHED THAT PLACE. Everyone is supposed to be set free except maybe the Pharisees &gt;&gt; who had a different idea who followed after Jesus with their own ideas as human beings. For them they never desired for that freedom. They desire just to look for a way of putting him down. But as long as Christ stepped in every place, there was liberty. Mark 5 verse1. Mark 5:1. We are just going to read something here that will let us know that wherever Christ reaches there is freedom. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Every demon trembles and they run away. Praise the Lord. We are going to share something about the mad man here. Praise the Lord. uh from verse one. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that &gt;&gt; and they came uh over to the other side of the sea &gt;&gt; into the country of the Gadenness. And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tomb a man with unclean spirit. Just immediately the Lord Jesus Christ came out of the ship. After they crossed the water, there was a man, the Bible tells us that immediately he met him out of the tombs, a man with unclean spirit, WHO HAD HIS DWELLING among the tombs, and no man could bind him. No, not with chains. because that he had been often bound with feathers and chains and the chains HAD BEEN PLUGGED AS SAND BY him and fets broken in pieces. NEITHER COULD ANY MAN HIM. [clears throat] THIS MAN WAS SO DANGEROUS. NO MAN COULD TRY HIM. PRAISE THE LORD. and always night and day. He was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones. He was simply a man who was living with no freedom. His work was just crying, cutting himself with stones. That was simply a duty that he was doing because his body was being tormented. demons had possessed him. He was no longer having freedom as a human being. He was taken away by certain spirits and he was no longer living among people. This man was just isolated there. He found himself loving to be alone and even people also on the other hand. He said that he stayed away from them because he had a spirit. The Bible says unclean spirits and but when HE HE SAW JESUS A far off. He ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said, "What have I to do with thee, JESUS, THE SON OF the most high God? I adje by God that thou torment me not? For he said unto him, come out of man, no unclean spirit. THIS IS A STORY of a man. Who could have lived the way we live today? With freedom, you can go to the shop. No one can chase you. You can go to school. No one will send you away. You can go wherever you desire. Everyone will WELCOME YOU. BUT THIS MAN HERE, THE SPIRIT THAT POSSESSED HIM, the unclean spirit, he never had freedom anywhere. HE WAS HATED even by his own people. BECAUSE AT FIRST THE PEOPLE SAID THEY could manage. I TRIED USING CHAINS. LET US TIE THIS MAN AS WE TRY TO LOOK for a solution for him. BUT A MAN COULD JUST STARE DOWN HIS chains and go again after people. Praise the Lord. He was not a man who was living under freedom. He was being tormented by demons and demons were waiting for that moment. When this man would be alone, when he's just alone without people that I could START MAKING HIM CUT HIS BODY, maybe the body was itching. He thought maybe by scratching it could find freedom and there was no freedom. At least maybe when he was with people maybe people could rescue him from cutting himself. He had a bit of freedom, but it wasn't full. BECAUSE THE DEMONS IN him had AUTHORITY OVER HIS BODY. They could command HIS BODY, CUT THE CHAINS, run away and that would happen. Praise the Lord. You see how unclean spirit possess a man and remove all the freedom from you. Praise be name to the name of the Lord. Praise God. This man lived under the tombs. He just lived THERE IN THE MOUNTAINS. JUST A place of ISOLATION WHERE he had no hopes. He had no hopes that no one could ever come before him. NO ONE COULD have set him free BECAUSE THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT had possessed him. I don't know how the unclean spirit possessed him. What he has done, I don't know. But surely We are interested HERE TO KNOW HOW HIS FREEDOM CAME ABOUT. PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE GETTING YOUR FREEDOM, BROTHER, SOMETIMES it doesn't MATTER OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE. YOU SIMPLY NEED TO APPLY. You simply need to apply the FORMULA OF THE FORMULA OF THE HOLY SPIRIT and you get your freedom. Praise the Lord. And it doesn't matter. Whether you get that bondage when you are still in the world before you gave your life to Christ, it doesn't matter. BUT ALL IT MATTERS, HAVE YOU FOUND CHRIST? &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR LIFE TO HIM? HAVE YOU FULLY SUBMITTED YOUR LIFE TO HIM? ALL THE MEMBERS OF YOUR BODY and you set free. Praise the Lord. That is the kind of man this man was just in the tomb alone. Whether his children were eating, he doesn't know. Whether his family was okay, he doesn't know. He was just crying for himself because demons were disturbing him. HE WAS HAVING NO PEACE. He couldn't have it at all. Just demons around him, unclean spirits, just dancing around him, celebrating to see him CUT HIS BODY. DEMONS JUST CELEBRATING TO HIM. SEE him crying. BROTHER, SISTER, NEVER ALLOWS DEMONS TO CRY TO TO BE happy over every situation that you go through life. When a situation comes, you become gloomy. Don't want to talk to anybody. You want just to make sure everyone knows that you have problems. You're just annoyed. You hunt YOUR FREEDOM AND THAT freedom will be a dominion OVER. IT WILL DOMINATE YOUR LIFE AND EVERY TIME YOU HAVE FREEDOM. Even when poverty comes, YOU SEE WHAT IS POVERTY. CHRIST HAS SET ME FREE. I JUST HAVE TO GO TO HIM. GOD, I NEED what to eat. AND THEREFORE HE GIVES YOU AND HE BLESSES YOU WITH THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS and you get it in abundance. PRAISE THE LORD. WHEN SICKNESS COMES by the demon of sickness, Christ let me first pass by to the family of brother. Perhaps I may put him down. GETTING BROTHER WELL CHARGED IN HIS HOME. PRAISE THE LORD. HE HAS FREEDOM ALL OVER HIS HOME. I WANT YOU DEMONS WILL RUN AWAY BEFORE REACHING YOU BECAUSE I KNOW shame is a DIFFERENT PERSON ALTOGETHER. THAT IS THE KIND OF FREEDOM WE NEED, BRETHREN. WHERE SPIRITS cannot take you anywhere. Just dangling you. Just dangling you. Spirit's coming to tell you. You see, you don't have money. Go and gamble, you get money. And then you also say, "Yes, sir." And then you go and do it. YOU SEE THIS MAD MAN here in this place in the He had to obey whatever the spirit say the chains. He said yes sir. And he tears THE CHAIN. WHEN HE SAYS GO AND BEAT PEOPLE, HE SAYS YES SIR. YOU HAVE seen many people around. They can decide to chase you. That is a SPIRIT TELLING HIM. CHASE THAT ONE. CATCH HIM. PRAISE THE LORD. A DEMON TELLING YOU PICK PAPERS PUT ON YOUR BODY. THAT'S HOW MAD MEN BEHAVE. THEY DISOBEY EVERY SPIRIT. BRETHREN, we should not do that. WE SHOULD BE CHILDREN OF FREEDOM. WHEREBY WE HAVE AUTHORITY TO TELL THE DEVIL. You a liar. You can't have opportunity over me. I'M A CHILD OF GOD. I've been set free. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW THIS MAN HERE WHO LIVED UNDER THE tombs day after day the Bible say day and night he had no freedom just crying having no no hopes whether tomorrow will wake up well maybe the demons could give him small freedom to sleep and when he's sleeping maybe if I wake up I'll be fine So he wakes up. The body is still need to be cut. No freedom at all. This man had no freedom. He desired freedom. But he COULDN'T GET IT UNTIL there was one who came from the ship by the name the Lord Jesus Christ. WHEN HE CAME INTO the place, tell your brother, no spirit could stand. All the unclean spirits had to tremble because the princess was no longer the same. The atmosphere was different. Sins were no LONGER THE SAME. DEMONS WERE HAVING FREEDOM TO TORMENT THIS MAN. AND KNOW JESUS CHRIST AND COME INTO the place. The devil has no authority. The devil was just trembling and he was trembling speaking to him and he said, &gt;&gt; but when HE SAW JESUS A FAR OFF, he ran and worship worshiped him and cried with a loud voice &gt;&gt; and said, "What I what have I to do with thee, &gt;&gt; Jesus?" Yes, those son of the most high God. The demons were just NOW BEGGING SOMEONE WHO have authority as a child of God. The demons are just saying those hand out of God. I deserve thee by God that thou torment me not. Then you TELL THE DEMON, "GET GET OUT OF ME, THEREFORE, GET OUT OF my way and let me continue." Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; had a mission somewhere. BUT ALONG THE WAY, DEMONS WERE opposing the area. But where Jesus HAD TO PASS, EVERY SPIRIT HAD TO CLEAN AWAY. ALL OF THEM HAD TO RUN AWAY BECAUSE TRUE HOLINESS WAS PASSING THEM. TRUE FREEDOM WAS PASSING BY AND NO DEMON COULD STAND IT. PRAISE THE LORD. Because the atmosphere was no longer the same. When you HAVE TRUE FREEDOM, THE ATMOSPHERE IS NOT THE SAME AS YOU DO NOT HAVE FREEDOM. Praise the Lord. You walk as in Christ, not as a person who has fallen. Praise the Lord. That is how the demons cried. Son of the most high God, I rejected by the by God. Though torment me not, FOR HE'S SIDE UNTO HIM, COME OUT OF HIM, UNCLEAN SPIRIT. JESUS, YES, &gt;&gt; never had time to play with a demon and tell him, "How did you come to me? When did you come to heal? How did you access him? BY which what MEANS HE COME? JESUS NEVER HAD A TIME. He only had a time to say come out of him. Do not negotiate with demons. The moment YOU GIVE THE DEVIL OPPORTUNITY, SMALL OPPORTUNITY like this to negotiate with him, I do it or I don't do it. The prophet says, "Do not waste your time to debate." If something is not right, just leave it and continue. Cut it out of you that you may have freedom. Praise the Lord. This demon tried to torment this man. A man who also live desired a life like ours. But the devils were trying to come to him. But Jesus came and said, "Come out, come out of the man, th unclean spirit." And he answered him, "What is thy name?" And he answered, saying, "My name is Legion, for we are many." And being, he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. Praise the Lord. It was now demons that were trying to struggle. But at least even if you want to send us out this country here, we still need it to send us out out of this country. It means brother as much as they cast away spirit from a person from one district does not mean that demons have left all people. Demons will continue living around simply cast away from one person. For them they continue operating for others. Now this man was alone. He's the only one who desired freedom at that moment because his LIFE WAS IN TORMENT. HE NEEDED TRUE FREEDOM. BUT CHRIST CAME AND set him free and he was free indeed. Praise the Lord. You need your life to be free. My brother, my sister, when you're free, Christ will always dwell in you and you have authority over everything. Sorry, my phone is going off. Let me open from here. Mark 5, we end verse verse 11 because in verse 10 it says that he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. Now there was there is nine unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding swine feeding. Those are the pigs. AND ALL THE DEVILS BESOUGHT HIM, SAYING, "Send us unto the strength that we may enter into them." And for we Jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirit went out. Remember in the beginning the Bible talks about unclean spirit. But now here we are seeing unclean spirits. Meaning these demons were many. They were all possessing this man. They were all HAVING CONTROL OVER HIM. THAT'S WHY WE SAID EARLIER on every demon HAD A RIGHT TO SAY DO this and a man could do that was a different demon. When a demon say go and kill that person and he was able to obey, that was a demon of murder. WHEN THE DEMON SAID GO AND CHASE THOSE PEOPLE THAT WAS A DEMON OF the demon which you could NOT BE RULED. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. These demons were many. Praise the Lord. Brother, SISTER, WHEN YOU ALLOW ACCESS OF one demon to your life, just know that THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF MANY DEMONS COMING AFTER YOU. Let me give an example of a drunk PERSON STAGGERING AROUND the Lord. He thinks that the road all is. EVEN WHEN A car comes, HE WILL TELL A CAR PASS THERE BECAUSE HE THINKS IN HIS MIND ALL THE ROAD IS HIS. IN THE BEGINNING, it was A SPIRIT OF DRUNKARDNESS. NOW, THE SPIRITS ARE NOW MANIFESTING THEMSELVES. THE ARROGANT SPIRIT IS SAYING pass there, destroy his mind. WHEN A WOMAN PASSES, YOU COME HERE. THAT IS NOT A SPIRIT SPEAKING IN HIM. THAT IS NOT A SPIRIT OF ADULTERY OR FORNICATION. THAT IS HOW SPIRIT CAN ACCESS YOUR LIFE. TRY TO have dominion over you. THEY TRY TO HAVE CONTROL OVER YOU, TRY TO DOMINATE YOU and they want CONTROL OF YOU, TELL YOU WHATSOEVER THEY DESIRE. WHEN ONE SPIRIT COMES UPON YOU, UNCLEAN SPIRIT, many many more spirits come because the house is theirs. The spirit over that will say, "Let me first go and pick a spirit of drunkenness. That might be my visa today." And the spirit of drunkenness comes. Then he said, "No, we need even the spirit of safety or stealing. LET'S GO AND INVITE HIM ALSO. IT IS OUR HOUSE. They having dominion. They have a right TO INVITE EVERY SPIRIT TO COME OVER YOU. BROTHER, SISTER, you must identify yourself &gt;&gt; to be with Christ. Don't allow spirits to dominate you. Praise the Lord. Now &gt;&gt; the spirits after having control over this man, &gt;&gt; Jesus cast them out and they went out and entered into the pigs AND VIOLENTLY DOWN A STEEP AND THOSE RAN violently down a steep place into the sea. I wonder about this part which we are going to read. There were about 2,000 pigs &gt;&gt; and were chocked in the sea. &gt;&gt; 2,000 pigs. [clears throat] How many demons were in this man? If they were all cast away, how many were they? We have seen 2,000. ALL OF THEM THEY RAN ONE AFTER THE OTHER PIG. ALL THE SPIRITS THAT WERE INVITED in they were all coming out. All the spirits of uncleanness, they were all coming out, the works of the flesh, they were not running away because Christ had come to set him free. Demons were very many. ALL THE PIGS HAD TO SUFFER the pain. And they that fed the swing FLED AND TOLD it in the city. And they went out to see what was that was done. Now listen here. And they come to Jesus and see that was AND AND SEE HIM THAT WAS POSSESSED with the devil and had a legion sitting and closed &gt;&gt; and in his right mind and they were afraid. Praise the Lord. People of the world don't care whether you've given your life to Christ. They are still afraid of you. There's anything that you can steal if Christ saved you from safety. They still THINK THAT YOU'RE THE SAME OLD man who likes things of the world. They will still be afraid. Has he really given his life to Christ? Is it really true? He will go to the neighbor. I hear Emma has given his life to Christ according to you. Is it true? We should be careful. They just not allow him anyhow in yet because anything can happen. Man might CHANGE AGAIN. THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT BELIEVING WHAT CHRIST HAD DONE. PRAISE THE LORD. BUT IT ONLY TAKES a true identity of freedom. Only in you who has been set free. Only you. YOU, YOU, BROTHER, SISTER. IT IS ONLY YOU WHO KNOWS, I'VE BEEN LIBERATED FROM SIN. I'M NO LONGER a slave of sin. IT IS YOU WHO KNOWS CHRIST HAS SET ME FREE. WHEN WE CONTINUE READING ABOUT THIS MAN, HE WENT ON TELLING PEOPLE, IT IS CHRIST WHO SET ME FREE. PRAISE THE LORD. HE WAS NOW PREACHING THE GOOD NEWS, TELLING THE PEOPLE, THE ONE WHO SET HIM FREE. Has other people were still murmuring. Who is this man here? Our pigs. See our pigs have gone to the sea. THIS MAN HAS DONE IT BAD. THEY WERE HATING the Lord Jesus Christ. They were not happy for what HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE SAME DEMONS THAT WERE IN THIS MAN WERE NOW SCATTERED AROUND THE COUNTRY. THEY NOW DOMINATED the men around. They had now possessed those people and those people were now having those demons. Each one identifying this demon in him. Some are saying THIS MAN HERE LET HIM GO OUT OF OUR COUNTRY ARE FAR OUT FROM OUR COUNTRY IS THEY SAID IT from the Bible here. HE SHOULD BE HE SHOULD GO OUT FROM THIS COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; HE HAS CAUSED TROUBLE. All our pigs are gone. They were no longer people who were living a life of happiness. You see that one of their own has been set free. Instead, they were sending away the one who set that man free away. The Bible says, "And they come to Jesus and see HIM THAT WAS POSSESSED WITH THE devil and had a legion and he had a legion sitting and clothed." This man was given also nice clothes to put on. Perhaps maybe the the the apostles gave him after he was set free because all demon possessed people. I mean physically demons possess people. There are people many people are demon possessed. Though they are not manifesting as other people manifest but people are possessed with demons. Don't assume. Don't assume my friend so and so doesn't do this so I can go with him. For him, he doesn't like these things of fornication. He doesn't like the things of doesn't like these things of God. So I can GO WITH HIM. BUT AS YOU MOVE WITH HIM, THE MANIFESTATION OF those spirits, unclean spirits will begin to manifest. If he doesn't like girls, he will take you into direction of things that he likes. Brother, they even like calling you brother SO AND SO. YOU ALSO TAKE A little just a little here. Just a little doesn't make you even like us. Now for you who who knew only one thing that your friend does not do has now fallen into a trap. Praise the Lord. Demons can try people and can take people very far. Sin can TAKE YOU FAR THAN YOU EXPECT. AND THEY THAT saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil. and also concerning the swing. This is verse 17 of the Bible says, "And they began to pray to him to depart out of their cost. They no longer wanted Jesus to be there because their spirits were not matching. Jesus was on the mission had finished to do his work. It was now time to continue ahead. Whether men accept Christ, whether they don't accept Christ, brother, sister, continue ahead, move on with your salvation. You don't need to be gloomy that even so and so has refused. My good friend has refused. How can I continue living without him or without her? When Christ finished the work there, he had to continue. Praise the Lord has led by the spirit of God in him. AND WHEN HE WAS COME INTO the the ship that HE HAD, HE THAT HAD BEEN POSSESSED WITH THE DEVIL prayed him that he might be with him. How be Jesus suffered him not but saith unto him. &gt;&gt; Go home to thy friends. And tell THEM HOW GREAT THINGS THE LORD HAS done for thee and has had compassion on you. Even when no one had compassion over this man, Jesus had compassion over him. Jesus had freedom over for him. EVERYTHING WAS IN HIM. JESUS CHRIST CAME WITH A FULL PACKAGE. And even his apostles were carrying a spare clothes. They gave him. He was now a clean man. Now going outside there preaching the gospel of good news. Now that you given YOUR LIFE TO CHRIST, YOU OUGHT TO TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT THE FREEDOM THAT YOU HAVE. THE TRUE FREEDOM THAT YOU HAVE MUST BE KNOWN TO EACH AND everyone that they may either be set free or fall into bondage because IF THEY ACCEPT IT, THEY WILL BE SET FREE AND THEY'LL BE FREE INDEED. and he DEPARTED &gt;&gt; AND BEGAN TO PUBLISH IN THE IN the And he began to publish in the police HOW GREAT THINGS JESUS HAD DONE for him. It was now publishing. It was now to publish. Praise the Lord. I do printing. And when we talk about publishing, &gt;&gt; it means a lot. It goes very far to publish a newspaper. It goes all over Uganda. This man was working tirelessly to publish the great things that Jesus had done for him and all men did marvel. AND WHEN JESUS WAS PASSED OVER AGAIN BY the sheep in unto the other side, much people gathered unto him. AND IT WAS NIGH unto unto the sea. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now Jesus setting men free. He went even over the other side. The Bible says immediately reached there. There was a one ruler of the synagogue, Gyrus by name. And when he saw him, he fell at his feet and besought to him greatly, saying, My little daughter life at the point of death, I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed, and she shall live." And Jesus went to him, and went and and much people followed him and thrown him. and a certain woman which had an issue of blood. SO THINGS WERE JUST CONTINUOUSLY HAPPENING. Freedom after freedom. Praise the Lord. Jesus Christ who is in you is now moving in you setting men free and making THEM FREE. JESUS WAS ON mission to set everyone free to obtain true freedom. Praise the Lord. Now, true freedom cannot be imagined. True freedom &gt;&gt; cannot be imagined. &gt;&gt; I want us read some quotes here as we close. I pray that my power will help me. Amen. The Bible I mean we are going to read from mean this quote here. Allow me get it. Praise the Lord. uh we are getting from uh that book uh I mean from that ceremony the believer's position in Christ we just going to narrate something little about Moses that the prophet talked about and that verse seven paragraph seven I mean then Moses lost all the hope and the power that he had. &gt;&gt; Thinking that freedom wasn't for the children of Israel, &gt;&gt; he had lost all the souls of freedom till God met met one day met him one day in a burning bush. And then when God's season came along just exactly He revealed his plans to Moses. What I what the prophet here is speaking was Moses in his own way trying to create freedom and liberty to the children of Israel. When things got hot, he had to flee and he lost holy hope. Now the reason that Moses had forgotten about the freedom God promised that he would free them. But God hasn't forgotten his promise. Moses tried in himself and failed. That is what the church has done many times. We have tried in ourselves to do things when we fail to find God's element of time. Brother, sister, freedom has an element of time. You cannot forge things out. You cannot camouflage. You cannot try them on your own just like Moses tried. It takes God's time, God's appointed time to come and set you free. If there be any bondage, either your family member or your friend or yourself is going through, wait on God. He will set you free. Praise the Lord. Don't fudge it out yourself. Paragraph 10 says, "So then when Moses find out now the real direct will OF GOD AND THE TIME of God and the revelation of everything to do now to TRY TO KEEP HIM OUT OF EGYPT." &gt;&gt; Now try to keep him out of Egypt. Right back to Egypt. Right back to Egypt. He went just as hard as he could to go for he knew that God had promised deliverance and the time had come for deliverance for it was directly. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When it is God's time, you go with liberty. If there be an opposed person in your family and you really true that you have freedom, you will match that person with true identity of Christ in you with THE FULL AUTHORITY WITH ALL THE FREEDOM AND YOU GO AND SPEAK TO THAT demon in your relative IN YOUR FRIEND'S LIFE. BE CAST OUT IN THE NAME of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. YOU'LL WALK WITH CONFIDENCE. Not with fear. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord because you KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOUR position in Christ. Praise the Lord. Now Moses was looking first at the word. The word of God HAD PROMISED THEM DELIVERANCE. MOSES WENT TO search scriptures. God promised the children of Israel freedom. AT ONE POINT THEY WOULD COME BACK TO THEIR PROMISED LAND. MOSES WAS SEARCHING SCRIPTURES. AND HE FOUND IT RIGHT THERE. HE KNEW THAT WAS GOD'S STAYING AND HE COULDN'T MOVE ANY INCH TO REFUSE TO GO there to set the children of Israel freedom. Praise the Lord. He had known it was a promised it WAS PRO GOD HAD promised them deliverance. He knew the TIME WAS NIGH. Now he had to have a direct CONTACT WITH GOD. AND WHEN TO DO IT. WHEN YOU HAVE FREEDOM, you know how and when to do it. You don't just you don't gamble. You don't just gamble. Today these demons let me come over you. Demons will will beat you. I mean they will kick you because you don't know your position. Praise the Lord. Now that WAS A TIME IT HAD come and I think of Moses how that Moses &gt;&gt; standing up there on the mount by the side of this burning bush. He had lost all hopes of freedom. It didn't seem like that the freedom that it didn't seem that the freedom that the people he so gallantly stood for stood for one time was ever going to happen. But in the light of God standing by the by that burning bush, everything in him changed. All the attitude changed, the behavior changed, the mindset changed, everything in Moses was working out itself. Not by Moses himself, but God in the mountain there before the burning bush. was speaking to Moses. God was relocating his his body. HE WAS PUTTING HIS MIND into a right state to accept freedom for the children of Israel. Moses had to believe freedom first before he could go and proclaim freedom. You cannot go and tell the people of the world freedom when you yourself does not have freedom. It is practically impossible. PRAISE THE LORD. YOU must have an identity in you. Christ working in you and then afterwards you have freedom to go out to speak to them THAT YOU ARE FREE INDEED. PRAISE THE LORD. THAT IS WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO MOSES HERE. MOSES WAS now understanding that this was the time and was need the time for them to go and and bring the children out of bondage. If the sinner could only see that if the sinner would only hear the true gospel, not the joining of the churches, but the preaching of the gospel that you can be free from sin. PRAISE THE LORD THAT YOU CAN BE FREE FROM YOUR SICKNESS. AT A CERTAIN TIME THAT is a time you believe. You know those slaves were so excited. THOSE SLAVES WERE SO EXCITE WERE SO excited and such anticipation waiting for our that they would be free. The prophet was trying to narrate a story here about the slaves who were waiting for freedom because freedom was allocated for them at second time. Praise the Lord that they will gather at the bottom of the of the hill. Mothers and little children all gathered and some of them the old and they were climbed UP TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AROUND MIDNIGHT. They known when THE DAY BREAK AND THE SUN COME up that THEY WOULD BE FREE. IT WOULDN'T TAKE OVER ONE half of the minute to shine the sun from the top of the hill. &gt;&gt; They were JUST WAITING FOR THE SUN TO come and then they would be free until they couldn't wait any longer. Some people had to climb on top of the mountain to wait to see the sun. Is it coming? Is it? Where has it reached? AND THEN THEY SHOUT FREEDOM. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. And then even people down THE HILL THERE WOULD SHOUT FREEDOM BECAUSE FREEDOM HAD COME UPON THEM. This was a story of the the the slaves. PRAISE THE LORD. That was so for those people. They were so excited to see freedom. But when the sun rises one of these days and the sun rose some 1900 years ago, he broke every slave, every slave belt. He set every captive free. He heal EVERY SICKNESS. HE GAVE FREEDOM TO THOSE WHO ARE IN BONDAGE. HOW WE OUGHT to climb and watch and see our freedom coming. The freedom whereby we shall no longer see the things of this world. How much glad shall we be? Brethren when THE FREEDOM COMES WHERE THERE WILL BE NO MORE SIN. THERE WILL BE NO more no more sorrow. Nothing more to worry. We shall be in glory just serving God and praising our father. RIGHT NOW WE ARE PEEPING. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE COMING OF THE LORD. WE ARE PRAYING. WE ARE WATCHING and we are gladly expecting HIM TO COME. WHEN HE COMES BROTHER, SISTER, FREEDOM WILL BE IN ITS FULLNESS. THERE WILL BE NO TEMPTATION, NO SIN, NOTHING ANYMORE. YOU RECEIVE ALL YOUR TRUE IDENTITY AND God will say well done my servant. God will not say again. How did you overcome the other? That will be our testimony TO SPEAK. THE FIRST THING JESUS WILL SAY WELL DONE MY SERVANT. YOU FAITHFUL SERVANT BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE IT RIGHT. This is your sight to be in glory WITH THE FATHER. THERE WILL BE LIBERTY. There will be FULL FREEDOM. NO SIN ANYMORE. NOT AGAIN wondering if I wake up tomorrow. Will I manage to get transport to go to school? School days will be done. Brother going to the clinic will be no more. seeking for the sins of the world will be no more because you would have passed from this life to the other life where Christ himself is our king. We shall be just worshiping him right now. We may not have enough time to worship God as much as we are seeking for that time because many things around the world are occupying our time. But brother, sister When you stay on the Lord, wait on God, there will come a time when you will not be doing anything serving God only, just giving him glory, just serving God in his fullness and God will be with you. May the Lord bless you as we stand up. Praise the Lord. I request brother Shalom to come and sing the same song that we were singing when we began the sermon. Shalom. I hope we are blessed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; By the way, I have a testimony. Before [clears throat] we can sing. Standing in the pp is not easy. The preachers know it and especially we young people. standing before a new people that you have not been standing before. You have that kind of fear. You feel like maybe they know it all. Maybe I'm preaching what they know already. You asking yourselves. But I want to tell you brother when I was preparing this sermon. I said there's freedom. These are my brethren. I must have freedom. I must preach with freedom. Pastor even one time came to me. I said, "Brother Emma, your inspirations are good, but you fear people. You don't want to see people." I said, "Pastor, pray for me." Now God found me in this sermon. When I was searching about it, I found freedom. Now I can speak with liberty because Christ has taken over. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you, &gt;&gt; brother. They sing that song. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, he set me free. Yes, he set me free. He broke the bond [singing] of prison for me. Glory. Oh my [singing and music] Jesus to see it. Glory to God. He set me free. Oh, he set me free. [singing and music] Yes.
