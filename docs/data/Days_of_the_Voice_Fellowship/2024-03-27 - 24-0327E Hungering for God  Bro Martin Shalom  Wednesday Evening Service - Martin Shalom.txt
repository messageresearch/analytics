thank you for coming and may God bless you amen our pastor is not with us uh we are aware all of us most of us are aware that uh he traveled and uh he called me this some few minutes ago is's already in Addis that's why is ministering this evening so you remember him in your prayers amen yeah before we take our seats I just want us to read a portion of scripture here in Matthew Chapter 5 I'll begin from verses three uh says let us read in the name of the Lord blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the Mi for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God Amen Lord Jesus we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read and other scriptures we will read Lord father you know that I have nothing to say this evening I remember one time you came down and shut the mouth of lion when Daniel was cast in the den of lion I pray that even this evening Lord may you come Lord and close my mouth for my own words may the Holy Spirit Come and Echo this Oracle unto your children this evening father we thank you we are trusting and entirely depending on thee this evening in Christ Jesus we pray amen yeah God bless you I was wondering this evening what uh I'm going to share with the body of Christ it has always uh it's always one of the hardest moment of my life to stand before the elect of the Lord so I believe you came when you have prayed and when you are expectant and if you indeed you prayed and you expecting to hear from God I trust that God will speak to you this evening Amen brother [Music] San blessed be the name of the Lord yeah this evening I want to I want us to share we are going to talk about hungering for God I know it has been preached very many time I've also ever preached it uh but I feel this evening I feel to go that direction blessed be the name of the Lord yeah you know hunger when we are hungering for God it's like a driving force that drive us amen if you talk of fervent desire to pleas God it moves together with that hunger because without that hunger we are just ordinary people it is that hunger that gives us that desire you call it like today they I hear them saying that Vibe something that moves you amen blessed be the name of the Lord if you look at people who are running a race they don't just run anyhow and you pray for me I have flu and I've been battling with it but I know God will give me the grace amen uh normally when there is a race or a competition set there must be a price to be WN amen and that price will be the driving force when we go to school we don't just go there to study and study and study no sir but when we go there at the end of the term of the year every time or every semester we get a a a report amen or a result so when we are studying when we are learning we are learning bearing in our mind that by the end of or after the end of this semester we going to have a result of what we have been doing at school or at campus blessed be the name of the Lord but if they had made it that you just go and you study Brother people would have not even bothered say after all ah you just studed St and studying and studying talk of a soccer game they will set there a trophy and then different team will come from different areas amen we hear of different teams in the world you hear of those who support Manu those who support support Arenal Shel and other team Uganda crane but all those people they compete for something amen and and you find them undergoing training they wake up in the morning sometime they call it teas they go for teas they run around they jump the frog jump they make some pushups Amen to prepare them to make their body to make their mind to make them ready for the competition blessed be the name of the Lord and the Bible says that let the physical things teaches as spiritual things amen there is no no difference because in the world there is a spirit driving them and in Christian fraternity we there is also the spirit moving us or driving us blessed be the name of the Lord but if where we have read in Matthew Chapter 5 vers uh it is in verse six Jesus said bless said are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled amen if we don't hunger if we don't thirst we shall not be filled so if blessed are they if blessed are those who do hunger and thirst for righteousness what is the opposite of blessing the opposite is cast so if you don't thirst and if you don't hunger for righteousness then you are casted blessed be the name of the Lord amen this happen even to non-christians you find them looking for happiness what make them looking or go looking for that happiness it is because of the hunger they have in their heart for those things and now Prophet tells us that is the real right hunger but being perverted of the devil amen that man is made in the way that inside his heart he has to worship amen so there is a versum in his heart which that verum what can quench that versum what can fill that Gap is only God and God alone but that devil divert that hunger and you find someone go drink that he won't forget his problem he won't forget his sorrow and then after being drunk for just some few hours he will pretend that has forgotten the sorrow but I've ever found drunkard men crying again not tears of joy that today I'm so drunk that I'm so happy but regardless of that drunkenness still they remember their sorrow and they find them crying maybe because they have been because uh they've been drinking that's why uh their marriage broke and now the man has remembered the time he used to have at home the fellowship with the family and you find the man crying blessed be the name of the Lord so the same thing we are living in the time where there is a lot of things there are many things that try that we are substituting with the hunger for God because we must and we must have hunger for God when a Christians is having conviction when we have Godly conviction in our heart it will always drive us toward righteousness because the Bible tells us that we should be holy be holy because your father in Heaven is Holy so Godly hunger will always drive us toward Holiness amen because when we Are Holy not having our own Holiness but God's holiness God is happy with us amen that is the reason Jesus came Jesus never came that we should remain in our sin in our bondage in our shame but Jesus came to set us free from the bondage of sin amen so we ought to be free people we ought to be people who are hungering and thirsting for God last Friday we talk about the soul travail and if you look at this is almost the same thing but just in another Direction amen blessed be the name of the Lord blessed are they uh blessed are the uh blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God Purity in heart does not just come from nowhere but the hunger of God purifieth our soul blessed be the name of the Lord when we are hungering for God we will be conscious of our sins amen the hunger for God makes a Christian to acknowledge his sins and when we acknowledge our sins we repent we confess them amen acknowledgement of our sin this where we look at ourself we look how short we are how belit we are before God Amen this is when we are seeing what God did for us that we were undeserving blessed be the name of the Lord but God because of his Mercy when he thought of us he came down and redeemed us blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise the Lord hungering for God you can when you are hungering for God or when you are thirsting for God you will be in desperation and you find that uh you find very few Christian with that desperation the word is preached different means they will come and preach and you find you're not desperate but each each time God sends the message each time God sends the word God does not just move just anyhow amen but every time God sends a minister he has a reason he want to do something he's speaking to somebody is speaking to you and me amen and the word comes and sometime you find we are on tension we are on our toes but the following day the fire dies out why because we don't have that hunger we have to reach a point whereby each one of us we build our personal relationship with God we must be certain of God we are having Christian who are not certain of God amen they are not sure whether on the right whether they are believing the right message they're not sure whether they're going to heaven they're not sure whether they are Christian they're not sure whether they are Saint amen they are not even sure whether they're in a church and when you're not certain of God you can easily be deceived because you look at another organization and you will think that they're doing much better than you or us blessed be the name of the Lord amen but Jesus said blessed is the man who hungers and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled without hunger you cannot be filled without hunger you cannot even cook food that mothers cannot if Mom is not hungry and the children are not hungry and Dad is not hungry do you think they will cook no they will not and God each time God comes he always comes to feed the hungry Souls amen there are people almost everywhere whose heart are all a flame what is that flame it is the hunger amen those men and women were hungering for God that's why their hearts were on fire it was bubbling in their soul they were hungering that's why time came when they were threatened and they were kind of losing their morale the Bible says they went and gathered in one of the brothers house and they locked thems there and they prayed and they were rilled again blessed be the name of the Lord when you see things are not moving when you see that you're are not hungering for God you need to go into the closet blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet refers as as iglet he said God is the mother ego and when an ego get when the ego uh get old it goes in the rocks and it revive it strength Christian we must have questions we must be questioning our lives because this is the body of Christ is a healthy body and a healthy body must grow spiritually because we are talking about spiritual matters amen we know ourselves we know whether we are overcoming or whether we are being defeated blessed be the name of the Lord We complain about business and tiredness but that is typically a spiritual problem more than a problem of schedule because you'll find that in such a case where we are Desiring you are Desiring other things more than God but you are saying you are busy you see blessed be the name of the Lord I'm not talking about hunger and thirsting for busyness or our own personal things but we are hungering and thirsting for God because after hipping all it's God that matters blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why Jesus says that what will benefit a man to eat the whole world and by the end of the day you lose your soul blessed be the name of the Lord only the hungry all only the people who are hungering for God or are thirsting after righteousness they are the only people who are filled with the Holy Spirit blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus says in John 4:14 whosoever drinketh of the water I give him will never thirst indeed the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life when Jesus gives you that water you will not thirst for something else but to be thirsting and hungering for God and in John 6:35 is then Jesus declared I am the bread of life which uh I'm the bread of life who came who comes whosoever comes to me will never go hungry and whosoever Believes In Me will never be thirsty and remember uh the Bible says in John 3:37 that on the last on the last and greatest day of the feast Jesus stood and said in loud voice if any man if anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink whosoever Believes In Me as the scripture has said streams of Living Water will flow from within him blessed be the name of the Lord amen you know as the days um as the years are going by as approaching the coming of the Lord the way is getting narrow and narrower blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why you find that uh you Ed not to struggle to some extent but somehow today somewhere somehow you are struggling things are getting worse but Abraham in the message the world is falling apart it says everything is crumbling nations are breaking politics is crumbling churches are crumbling amen look at the Pentecostal World sometime maybe like in the YouTube you go and see what is happening there they are fighting one another there is no life there and we say in the message the life is in the seed which is true but if the life is the seed that seed must be identified amen you must be having a sign of Life inside you in whatever we do in our daily life the life of Christ must be manifested in US amen and how are we going to see these are things which are not just going to presume about or think about it but this are the things which must be manifested when Brother s is hungering for God He will always be here amen you will not force him as far as serving God is concerned his way of worshiping will exchange blessed be the name of the Lord because we have got the full package of the hour and we are not just running anyhow like Apostle Paul say that we are not Bo like people are boxing air we know what we are talking about when comes the Holy Spirit you know what you're talking about you know who he is that the Holy Ghost this is the passion of Jesus Christ in The Believer blessed be the name of the Lord other think that the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues you know much much better than them others think that the Holy Ghost is casting out demons others think that the Holy Ghost is praying and you cry but we are the people who know that when it comes the Holy Ghost we know who he is amen we know what he does when he comes and we know how how to get him we know how to approach God blessed be the name of the Lord amen where is that hunger I remember one time we talked about returning to the first love brother it is the first love which will give us Victory because all of us when we had just believed we were too us amen and God was happy and brother tells us that the early church is the pattern this message the coming of Malachi for is to restore us back to the apostles amen restoring back is all not only the word the power the glory of God the Holy Ghost amen because we run without the word we in denomination without the word and we were seeking God not knowing that we had left him in the word blessed be the name of the Lord we were holding men's tradition yet God is in his word but when the prophet came he told us Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and himself says that the church the pattern it is the book of Acts but if you look at ourself people who are waiting for the rupture and we look at ourself with the book of Acts or the Acts of the Apostles if you wear yourself because the Bible tells us we should make our calling and election sure each one of us will know this amen so my brothers my sisters what happened and what went wrong blessed be the name of the Lord David says in Psalms chapter 63: 1 that oh God you are my God honestly I Seek You My Soul thirst for you my body Longs for you in a dry and we land where there is no water amen honestly will I Seek You When David lost the joy of salvation we are seeing David in Psalms 51 crying oh God restore unto me the joy of my salvation the joy of my salvation the joy of our Salvation is the fuel which keeps the believer to move because without that but what I'm say that when a child of God backslide is not lost but you lose the joy of your salvation you become dry you become Canal when a Believer is living in sin he becomes Canal what happened that Veil moves away and then you remain dry when you come to church 30 minutes you'll be checking on your watch you'll be so anxious of the incoming messages in your phone why because you you lost the joy of Salvation yes sir when the minister is preaching it's like you feel it's taking long we know these things even I was reading that message the other day you see it's because that Joy is not there but get my brother amen get my man or woman who is hungering for God Amen whose hearts are bubbling it will be different story even when you have only two or five in the church the church it will be like the church is parked with hundreds of them blessed be the name of the Lord so my brother my sister if there is something that we need to we need money and other things that is okay but let God give us that hunger in our heart God F me God cleanse me amen God bend me mold me that should be our prayer shape me after your own image blessed be the name of the Lord amen blessed are the poor in spirit for there is the Kingdom of Heaven others mistake this scripture and they think that when you are poor person you are spiritual and sometime they even quote this scripture but say bless are the poor in spirit blessed be the name of the Lord what is the best way of learning prayer It Is by praying amen the best way to learn how to pray is by praying we go before God God give us that burden there are time we say that without the without the birth pain the baby cannot be born and we are carrying the womb we are cutting the seed in us and the Bible tells us as was in the days of Jo uh in the days of Lord as was the days of his first shall it be in his second coming and we seeing this first in first coming the word put on flesh the word became flesh and was manifested Among Us amen and Jesus say as it was in his first coming shall it be in his second coming this same word is putting on flesh again amen and you and me God is being tabernacled in US blessed be the name of the Lord amen he says that whether that how much we pray that I think finally the matter of appetite of hunger for God and all that he is and desire we have plenty of food could it be that the church is the pool of laia the church has backslide and lost their hunger for God we are not going with the flow of the age we need back God in fact we need back God back in his church blessed be the name of the Lord the church has backslide and lost their hunger for God and that is a very very dangerous State praise be to God may God give us that anger because if we lose it we are gone what has kept us moving what has kept me moving for all these years know that I don't make mistakes mistakes will be there but inside your heart something will tell you you can make it try again press on Amen and then you get encouraged and you rise up again and you keep moving on what has kept us moving for this time it is the grace of God that hunger of God in our heart and we should not allow that to die Believers you ought to have appetite for word 24/7 because the moment the devil takes that away you are gone amen and only what can kill our appetite what can kill that hunger is the things of the world you see nowadays you don't need to go in the streets and do something weird maybe see naked women you can even just through your your phones and computers the devil has brought it close to you and if there is something that is keeping us busy so much busy is the gagets around us and sometimes it's very hard it is very hard even to realize the way I always weigh it how much time time do I spend with my phone and how much time do I spend reading the Bible and how much time do I spend in prayer that's the only way you can balance that you say you know I'm doing business yeah it's okay to do business online it is okay but after you are done with your business uhhuh then get your timetable for the whole week for how long and that can tell blessed be the name of the Lord but get someone who's hunger okay physical hunger a child can even fall in the S span because of hunger sometime at home I see my wife when the baby's hungry she comes and gra and grabs here Mommy food this one grabs here it's because that kid is hungry the body is demanding for food amen and physical things and spiritual things they are just the same you cannot tell us that you are hungering for God you are waiting for the Rapture and you're not minding about your soul you come to church occasionally you don't know that because if you're hungering for God you will try your best that you reach there very early you will come singing Praise amen there are some people who come to church they come watching their staffs when it reaches the church entries then switched off the phone
