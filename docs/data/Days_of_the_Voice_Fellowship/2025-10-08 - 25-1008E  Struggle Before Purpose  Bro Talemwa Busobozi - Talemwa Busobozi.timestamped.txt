[33:30] many colors that was on him. And they
[33:32] took him and cast him into a pit, and
[33:35] the pit was empty. There was no water in
[33:37] it. And they sat down to eat bread. And
[33:40] they lifted up their eyes and looked and
[33:42] behold a company of Ishelites came from
[33:45] Gilead with their camels bearing spicy
[33:48] and balm and ma going to carry it down
[33:51] to Egypt. And Judah said unto his
[33:53] brethren, what profit is what profit is
[33:56] it if we slay our brother and conceal
[33:59] his blood? Come and let us sell him to
[34:02] the Ishalites and let not our hand be
[34:06] upon him for he is our brother and our

[36:17] You know sometimes I always tell you to
[36:18] repeat those words
[36:21] is because hearing and speaking are two
[36:24] different things
[36:27] and confession speaking something
[36:31] is usually usually means more to you
[36:36] than just hearing it.
[36:38] So tell your neighbor struggle before
[36:40] purpose.
[36:44] Amen.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; On Sunday last I spoke on uh on on on
[36:50] born for a purpose
[36:54] in budo
[36:56] and um I think it was good for the young
[36:58] people
[37:00] because then I was dealing with I've
[37:01] spoken on it here before purpose. I was
[37:03] dealing on purpose with purpose
[37:06] and I said you know for you to be able
[37:08] to overcome
[37:12] many challenges in this life.
[37:15] For you to be able to excel,
[37:19] for you to be able to be prosperous,
[37:22] you need to have a driving force.
[37:27] And that driving force is purpose.
[37:32] There are many that have given up.
[37:35] Many today, even today, as I'm speaking,
[37:37] they're committing suicide.
[37:40] many who are, you know, taking drugs
[37:44] and others have just given up on life.
[37:48] And you know, when especially you try
[37:50] and try and try and things don't seem to
[37:51] work the way you desire them to be.
[37:57] You know, many people give up.
[38:00] How do you know that someone has given
[38:02] up?
[38:03] Someone giving up does not mean that
[38:05] they will walk away from the church or
[38:06] from the fellowship.
[38:10] all that necessary they'll leave Christ.
[38:13] Sometimes they will even stay.
[38:16] But you know someone has given up when
[38:18] they are you know when when they are not
[38:20] motivated
[38:24] when they say let us sing.
[38:27] You'll be like yeah
[38:29] let them sing. Let us clap our hands.
[38:32] Clap for what?
[38:35] They don't know my sadness and
[38:39] Let them clap and you know say
[38:41] hallelujah. Say hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:43] Say well. Hallelujah. For what? You know
[38:47] they're not motivated.
[38:51] Someone who has given up is someone who
[38:54] eventually becomes cold
[38:58] when then he started hot.
[39:02] You know he always was coming to church
[39:05] and sitting on the front bench.
[39:08] But now he comes late
[39:10] and sits on the back of bed,
[39:13] you know, he does not say amen to the
[39:16] word anymore.
[39:18] is a bit set back
[39:22] you know and sometimes they even stop
[39:24] coming to church
[39:27] and you know they don't fellowship with
[39:28] the with the brethren and
[39:31] because they don't find a reason
[39:34] to do what those things that I mentioned
[39:38] but you see
[39:40] it is easy to give up
[39:43] especially in this world full of
[39:45] uncertaintities is
[39:48] and I'm preaching to you.
[39:51] I'm I'm meaning you.
[39:53] So do not be absent.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; And even you on Zoom, as long as you're
[39:59] hearing the voice,
[40:02] don't be passive.
[40:05] I'm talking to you as an individual.
[40:09] You as an individual. You know,
[40:11] sometimes when you in church, you are
[40:13] like, "Yeah, the pastor is talking to
[40:15] us.
[40:17] So sometimes you don't hear some things
[40:20] because you say that's not mine. Pastor
[40:22] is not talking to us. God is speaking to
[40:25] you.
[40:27] Praise God. And so I want us I want us
[40:29] to be in the service
[40:31] and do not miss what God is trying to
[40:33] speak to you tonight.
[40:36] And so you become passive
[40:40] and there are many things because this
[40:41] world is full of uncertaintities.
[40:47] This world is full of failures.
[40:51] It is full of disappointments.
[40:54] [Music]
[40:55] Someone you trust so much they
[40:57] eventually disappoint you so big
[41:01] and therefore you decide to give up.
[41:04] You say
[41:06] things I'm tired
[41:09] prayed four years, three years. What
[41:12] have I gained? Have you heard people
[41:13] speaking like that? Those are signs of
[41:16] giving up.
[41:18] The surrendering
[41:20] surrender to faith.
[41:23] A believer does not surrender to faith.
[41:27] A believer drives his faith.
[41:32] You are the one that determines what
[41:34] will be in your life.
[41:37] Or else God would not make us femoral
[41:39] agents.
[41:43] Praise God. If you have purpose,
[41:47] you will stay focused.
[41:49] No matter what happens in your life,
[41:52] you know you're going to be on fire for
[41:54] God.
[41:55] When you are single, you're going to be
[41:58] on fire for God. When you get married,
[42:01] you're going to be on fire for God. When
[42:03] you have children, you're going to have
[42:06] to be on fire without children. But let
[42:09] me tell you if you are going to give up
[42:12] to circumstances
[42:15] there are many reasons you will always
[42:17] have to give up
[42:20] so me I can't go to church I have
[42:23] children
[42:25] you have how many two one about the one
[42:29] who has five
[42:32] have you ever read about Susanna
[42:35] and yet the Bible says with all the
[42:36] children rather history says is that all
[42:39] the children she had
[42:42] she took time to pray with each and
[42:45] every one of them
[42:49] and they all became great.
[42:52] One of them is John Wesley.
[42:54] So you mother many of you are giving up.
[42:58] Many of you are becoming cold. You're
[43:01] becoming indifferent. The fire is going
[43:04] down. Why? Why did you start having the
[43:08] fire?
[43:10] Because you you never had purpose.
[43:14] Some of you never had fire because you
[43:16] had the right purpose.
[43:20] They have the wrong purpose.
[43:23] So let me dance so much so that the
[43:26] brothers can see me, so that the sisters
[43:29] can see me. But after you married, then
[43:32] all the fire ever breaks.
[43:35] because you never had purpose.
[43:38] When you struggle a little bit, you give
[43:41] up.
[43:43] Now, I'm going to speak on something
[43:45] real tonight.
[43:48] Praise God. We should not let the fire
[43:51] be quenched.
[43:53] We should not let our prayer be, you
[43:55] know, uh be destroyed. Our prayer life,
[44:00] we should let the fire stay burning.
[44:05] regardless of the struggles of life.
[44:10] And I'm going to show you tonight, Amen,
[44:13] that every child of God
[44:16] must have purpose.
[44:18] But those who have purpose,
[44:22] Amen, according to the predestination of
[44:24] God,
[44:27] those that are born for real great
[44:29] purpose,
[44:32] they will never attain it easily,
[44:37] there will always be strength.
[44:40] Amen.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; If you feel or think you have vision
[44:46] for how you you want your life to be,
[44:50] you have envisioned your life 5 years,
[44:52] 10 years, 20 years from now.
[44:55] And yet it seems each time you try you
[44:59] know trying to achieve what you have
[45:01] purposeful
[45:04] the more you try to achieve the more you
[45:06] struggle and you feel like sometimes
[45:09] some struggles look like as if it will
[45:12] never happen.
[45:17] Actually many believers die
[45:21] on the line of struggle
[45:24] in the face of struggle.
[45:28] But listen, it is the will of God
[45:32] and and let's just get into the word now
[45:35] and talk about this. That was just to
[45:37] introduce to you a little bit.
[45:40] Now we took a case study here on Joseph
[45:46] and we see that Joseph
[45:48] was hated by his brethren
[45:51] but unlike unlike his brethren
[45:56] Amen. Amen. As opposed to his brethren
[45:58] Joseph was born for a greater purpose.
[46:04] He was different from his brethren.
[46:08] I believe I am like Joseph.
[46:12] Not everyone is like Joseph.
[46:14] Maybe you are like Joseph.
[46:17] But maybe others are Judah,
[46:20] others are whoever
[46:22] or
[46:24] Joseph was born for a great purpose
[46:29] and his brothers did not like him.
[46:32] His brothers hated him.
[46:34] struggle began
[46:36] right in his father's house,
[46:40] right in the comfort of his home.
[46:44] But because there was struggle,
[46:46] that was a sign. He was a boy born for a
[46:50] great purpose.
[46:54] And you know the father loved him and
[46:56] then you know gave him a court of many
[46:58] cows.
[47:00] But you know his brothers hated him.
[47:03] They did not love him. They called him a
[47:06] little dreamer.
[47:08] Somebody who always dreamed dream dreams
[47:10] and everything.
[47:12] You know he was gifted.
[47:14] If you have a purpose in this life, a
[47:16] great purpose in this life, I tell you
[47:19] what, God will give you gifts for it.
[47:23] Each of us here has specific gifts
[47:29] for which you do not need to get an
[47:30] education to be able to know you have
[47:32] them.
[47:36] Are you hearing? There is something you
[47:38] can study from school
[47:41] and you can be able to do it.
[47:43] But there is also something else that
[47:46] you will realize you have
[47:50] naturally speaking. How many people have
[47:53] started one thing
[47:55] and yet made a living with another
[48:00] study what they spend 20 years
[48:03] studying one in one discipline
[48:06] but then they end up spending there
[48:09] eight years
[48:11] 46 years
[48:15] doing completely something else.
[48:19] That 20 years was a waste of time.
[48:23] The 16 years was a waste of time.
[48:27] They they studied that because they told
[48:28] them study that.
[48:32] They started that because they thought
[48:33] according to what? Oh, they look at
[48:35] somebody. Oh, so so and so is a very
[48:37] good accountant.
[48:41] Oh, let me also study accountant.
[48:45] Oh, they just walk and then see someone
[48:47] working in the bank.
[48:49] I am going to be a banker.
[48:52] I want to be a teller.
[48:54] I want to be a bank manager. And then
[48:57] they go try to pursue that
[49:00] and waste six years
[49:02] studying that only to use it for
[49:05] nothing.
[49:07] You see, you were looking at somebody
[49:09] who was living their dream
[49:13] and you thought that was your dream.
[49:17] Each of us is created by God
[49:22] to live for a specific purpose of life.
[49:27] And let me tell you my brother, when you
[49:29] find a day you find your purpose
[49:33] is the day you'll begin to be
[49:34] prosperous.
[49:36] The day you find your purpose, you
[49:39] realize you do not struggle so much to
[49:41] accomplish so much.
[49:45] It happens naturally.
[49:48] Praise God. Why? Because you are living
[49:51] your purpose.
[49:56] Praise God. So notice Joseph. He was
[50:00] hated by his brothers and they said,
[50:03] "Well, they took him out and um you know
[50:05] tried teared his court
[50:08] and um then threw him into the pit,
[50:12] you know, and and then you know Judah
[50:14] said,
[50:16] What does it profit us to kill our own
[50:18] brother?
[50:20] Let us not kill him. Let us sell him to
[50:23] these um Ishalites,
[50:27] you know. Let us, you know, sell him
[50:28] out.
[50:30] And so now I want you to this is vers
[50:33] 37,
[50:35] but I want you to now fast track and go
[50:37] to verses 45.
[50:41] Let's go ahead of it. Ahead of it.
[50:44] Chapter 45 rather
[50:46] verses three.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And Joseph said unto his brethren, now
[50:50] this is way after,
[50:54] I am Joseph, that my father yet leave.
[50:58] And his brethren could not answer him,
[51:00] for they were troubled at his presence.
[51:03] And Joseph said unto his brethren, "Come
[51:06] near to me, I pray you." And they came
[51:09] near. And he said, "I am Joseph,
[51:14] your brother,
[51:16] &gt;&gt; whom ye sold into Egypt."
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; When you read the story,
[51:25] about selling him, about tearing his C,
[51:29] about making him feel bad,
[51:32] about throwing him,
[51:34] you feel so sorry for Joseph.
[51:37] But brother, sister, that Joseph might
[51:40] as well be you.
[51:43] Maybe you have been treated like that
[51:46] by people that were supposed to love
[51:48] you, by people who are supposed to be
[51:51] there for you.
[51:52] But let me tell you, my brother, nothing
[51:55] happens by accident
[51:58] to every child or daughter.
[52:01] Amen. If you know you a child of God,
[52:05] nothing has happened in your life by
[52:07] your act.
[52:10] Good or bad.
[52:12] I said good or bad.
[52:15] Even what you don't want to talk about.
[52:18] It happened for a good cause.
[52:22] As long as you are born of God,
[52:25] you were predestinated.
[52:27] You were in his mind before the
[52:30] foundation of the world. His eyes always
[52:32] watch for the sparrow.
[52:38] His eyes has been on you
[52:40] before you were born, after you were
[52:43] born, all through this life's journey
[52:47] up to the end of your life. In your
[52:49] life, his eye has always been on you.
[52:53] And his eyes will never cease to be on
[52:55] you.
[52:57] And he says, I've inscribed you in the
[52:58] palm of my hand. Amen.
[53:02] So you are all right
[53:04] because you are in his hand
[53:07] good or bad happening.
[53:09] It does not mean your purpose has
[53:12] failed.
[53:14] It actually means that it is driving you
[53:17] to purpose.
[53:21] And Joseph many years later
[53:24] his his brothers come to him and he
[53:27] tells them look at me I am Joseph your
[53:30] bride whom ye sold into Egypt.
[53:34] Now therefore be not grieved
[53:37] nor angry with yourselves
[53:41] that he sold me hither.
[53:43] For God did send me before you to
[53:45] preserve life.
[53:50] Amen. Amen.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; For these two years
[53:54] has the famine been in the land. And yet
[53:57] there are five years
[54:00] in the which there shall be neither be
[54:02] here earing nor harvest.
[54:07] And God sent me before you
[54:12] to preserve you a posterity in the earth
[54:18] and to save your lives by a great
[54:21] deliverance.
[54:25] Amen. God made his brothers
[54:29] to sell him so that he will go to Egypt
[54:33] and become a great man that he will go
[54:36] there before them that they will all
[54:39] come after him.
[54:41] [Music]
[54:43] Do you know it is because of Joseph
[54:46] that the children of Israel came to
[54:48] Egypt
[54:51] and they gave them a beautiful land.
[54:55] Did you know Goshan was a very beautiful
[54:58] place,
[55:00] very fatty land
[55:02] that that the Pharaoh who knew Joseph
[55:06] had given to them, he told them, "Take
[55:09] that piece of land and put your people
[55:12] there
[55:13] because Joseph was royalty
[55:17] and so they got this good, beautiful
[55:19] piece of land."
[55:22] Oh, I want you to follow me closely.
[55:24] And you know it was because of Joseph
[55:27] and it was not because of him. It was
[55:29] because of the act of their brothers of
[55:31] his brothers.
[55:35] They sold him
[55:37] &gt;&gt; so they can get refuge.
[55:39] Hallelujah.
[55:43] Believe it when the Bible says all
[55:45] things work together for God.
[55:52] Roman Romans 8:28.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know. Tell your neighbor. We
[55:57] know. We know. How many now know we know
[56:02] that all things not something not
[56:07] something? All things, good and bad,
[56:11] evil and righteous.
[56:14] All things
[56:16] work together for good.
[56:18] to them,
[56:20] &gt;&gt; not to everybody,
[56:22] but to them that love God,
[56:27] to them
[56:28] are the call
[56:31] according
[56:33] to his purpose.
[56:35] [Music]
[56:37] So now I'm talking about the people of
[56:39] purpose.
[56:42] To these people, my brother, all things
[56:45] work together for good.
[56:51] Oh Lord, I did this. I did that. This
[56:54] happened in my life. They did this to
[56:56] me. All things work together for good
[57:01] to them that are called
[57:04] according to his purpose.
[57:07] And God sent me here to preserve your
[57:10] posterity in the earth
[57:14] and to save your lives by a great
[57:15] deliverance.
[57:17] [Music]
[57:18] So now it was not you that sent me.
[57:24] Hallelujah. But God
[57:27] but God.
[57:29] Hallelujah.
[57:31] You know this word h is here
[57:35] &gt;&gt; and I preached on it before but God
[57:39] but also it is there in the book in in
[57:41] the New Testament
[57:43] he says but God
[57:46] who is rich in mercy
[57:49] and now here also Joseph says but God
[57:54] amen. So it was not them
[57:56] it was the mercies of God.
[57:59] Amen. Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; That sent is that sent him
[58:04] into captivity.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; And he has made me a father to Pharaoh
[58:10] and lord of all of his all and and lord
[58:13] of all his house
[58:16] and a ruler throughout all the land of
[58:18] Israel.
[58:20] Praise God. I want to show you God has a
[58:25] pattern
[58:26] and his pattern never changes.
[58:31] before any divine purpose is manifested
[58:36] for your life for a season.
[58:40] There will always be a season of
[58:42] struggle,
[58:48] &gt;&gt; brother. Interpret that correctly. There
[58:50] will always be a season of struggle.
[58:58] That's not an accident.
[59:01] Is God's pattern.
[59:04] Every seed must fall into the ground
[59:09] and every seed must die
[59:11] and then it will bring forth much fruit.
[59:16] Hallelujah. That's what it says in the
[59:19] book of John 12:24.
[59:21] Very verily I say unto you, except a
[59:25] corn of wheat
[59:28] fall into the ground and die, it abides
[59:32] alone.
[59:35] Unless it falls in the ground
[59:38] and die, it abides alone.
[59:41] But if it falling and if it die, then it
[59:46] will bring forth much fruit.
[59:49] [Music]
[59:50] Amen. Hallelujah.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; If there is no death, there is no
[59:54] multiplication.
[59:56] There must be death so that
[59:58] multiplication can
[1:00:02] the struggle is a dying process.
[1:00:07] It is the breaking of the outer shell
[1:00:11] so that the life inside
[1:00:14] Amen. The life inside the call
[1:00:18] begin to be expressed.
[1:00:22] There is a life in you my brother.
[1:00:25] The purpose of God in you
[1:00:29] God. But God by his sovereign mercy and
[1:00:33] grace
[1:00:36] has allowed you to go through the
[1:00:37] struggles of life
[1:00:41] so that his purpose can be revealed.
[1:00:46] Hallelujah.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:49] Amen. Amen. And you realize that so it
[1:00:51] is so easy for somebody.
[1:00:55] Let me tell you, if he's a child of God,
[1:00:58] it's never easy for anyone.
[1:01:02] If you see God blessing someone
[1:01:05] with some material thing,
[1:01:07] don't ever think it came easy.
[1:01:11] Don't take a shortcut.
[1:01:14] go through the process,
[1:01:17] there must be a struggle
[1:01:20] before purpose is revealed.
[1:01:24] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. For
[1:01:27] every victory,
[1:01:29] there will have to be a trial.
[1:01:33] Amen. In a message, what is that in your
[1:01:35] hand?
[1:01:37] A prophet says, "Oh, Moses said, I can't
[1:01:40] talk very good. Lord said, "I'm kind of
[1:01:44] slow of speech."
[1:01:46] He said, "I just can't do it." He said,
[1:01:49] "Who made the mouth of a man?"
[1:01:52] Amen. And begin to really calm Moses
[1:01:54] down.
[1:02:00] That's the way God does,
[1:02:02] brother. He shakes you down.
[1:02:05] He And then he shakes you down and build
[1:02:08] up again.
[1:02:11] Mhm.
[1:02:13] Amen. God is is breaking you.
[1:02:17] Some of you, God is still breaking.
[1:02:21] Even as a church. Amen. God is breaking
[1:02:24] us.
[1:02:25] Amen. Even as a ministry, God can allow
[1:02:29] things to happen in a church.
[1:02:32] Why? Because he's breaking us into
[1:02:35] different pieces
[1:02:38] so that he can build us up.
[1:02:41] That's the way the people today.
[1:02:44] You don't like to be broken. You get
[1:02:46] broke broke up. You got to be broken up
[1:02:49] before you can be remade.
[1:02:54] The prophet went down to the potter's
[1:02:56] house
[1:02:58] to get broke up to get on the wheel and
[1:03:01] span out something different.
[1:03:04] If you are a sinner, get on the wheel.
[1:03:08] God will break you down and he will mold
[1:03:10] you different. He will shape your life
[1:03:13] up different. He will shape your home
[1:03:16] life.
[1:03:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Depending
[1:03:21] on what you are going through.
[1:03:23] Some of you if you have a lot of
[1:03:27] gossip,
[1:03:29] God will take you through situations
[1:03:32] that will break you that will break you
[1:03:36] and break all the gossip out of you.
[1:03:41] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:44] Amen. If you have a lust
[1:03:46] or if you have one of these demons
[1:03:50] still in you, you cannot sit on the
[1:03:52] throne
[1:03:54] with those still tagging along.
[1:03:57] And so he takes you through a struggle.
[1:04:01] Takes you through the fire.
[1:04:03] Amen. So that you can drop all those
[1:04:05] things.
[1:04:07] Amen. Hallelujah. And then you will
[1:04:10] emerge out
[1:04:12] as someone who is remodeled
[1:04:15] according to his purpose.
[1:04:20] That's the law of preparation.
[1:04:24] The struggle is not to destroy the
[1:04:25] believer.
[1:04:28] to form Christ
[1:04:34] [Music]
[1:04:36] as we shall see if I get there if time
[1:04:38] allows me.
[1:04:40] The greatest purpose,
[1:04:44] we have a lot of purposes.
[1:04:46] Each of us as individuals.
[1:04:49] Amen. You have to find your purpose.
[1:04:52] But all of us as a seed of God, we have
[1:04:56] one major purpose
[1:05:00] and that purpose is that Christ may be
[1:05:03] seen in us.
[1:05:06] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:05:10] But the purpose of God even to send us
[1:05:13] this message
[1:05:15] is so that the bride
[1:05:19] will become the mystery of Christ.
[1:05:24] He wants that when we stand
[1:05:28] Christ will stand. When we are seen he
[1:05:32] will be seen when we speak he will
[1:05:35] speak. And that's why I'm called the
[1:05:38] third pool,
[1:05:40] the third phase. And many people think
[1:05:42] it comes easy.
[1:05:45] There is a process. And it's the process
[1:05:48] I'm speaking about today.
[1:05:51] You have to suffer to reign.
[1:05:54] God has to mold your cover.
[1:05:59] Something has to happen in your life.
[1:06:02] You have to struggle, brother.
[1:06:04] You have to struggle, sister.
[1:06:06] You have to go through what you are
[1:06:08] going through.
[1:06:09] Yes, I know you know what you have to
[1:06:11] attain
[1:06:14] and God knows you know it.
[1:06:17] And when it seems as if you are getting
[1:06:19] it
[1:06:21] then things happen.
[1:06:25] It is all part of the plan.
[1:06:29] It's all part of the process.
[1:06:32] He's molding a character.
[1:06:35] Amen. Is driving your life
[1:06:39] to come to purpose
[1:06:42] so that you will know. You will know
[1:06:44] that you yourself will know
[1:06:48] this is what God has envisioned you.
[1:06:52] This is what God has
[1:06:54] desired that I will do.
[1:06:58] Amen. That's the Lord preparation
[1:07:02] is to bring us to a place
[1:07:04] where the word can live through you.
[1:07:14] The struggle
[1:07:15] is God's secret workshop.
[1:07:22] You know, Joseph's pit
[1:07:25] was not a mistake. The pit where they
[1:07:28] threw him in,
[1:07:29] it was not a mistake.
[1:07:32] Hallelujah. Haha. Some of you have
[1:07:35] fallen in some pits.
[1:07:38] Well, I'm looking at angels,
[1:07:40] who have never had any peace
[1:07:44] who have never fallen into any pit. But
[1:07:46] I tell you what, my friend, I have
[1:07:50] fallen in many pits in my life. But I
[1:07:53] have good news for you tonight. Amen.
[1:07:55] those pits that you fell in, it was
[1:07:58] God's reaction.
[1:08:01] Before he could stand before Pharaoh,
[1:08:04] he had to stand alone
[1:08:08] in a prison.
[1:08:11] Joseph was in prison.
[1:08:13] Alone in. Why? Because God was preparing
[1:08:19] to stand before Pharaoh.
[1:08:22] Amen. Moses's desert
[1:08:26] was the place where God stripped him
[1:08:30] from all the selfconidence
[1:08:36] and replaced it
[1:08:39] with divine dependence.
[1:08:45] Some of you, you have a lot of
[1:08:47] self-confidence.
[1:08:51] Don't you ever think
[1:08:53] God will send you do what you know you
[1:08:55] are supposed to do
[1:08:59] until you get divine dependence
[1:09:04] until you lose all your selfconfidence.
[1:09:10] Education trains you to to have
[1:09:11] self-confidence.
[1:09:15] But the Holy Ghost, Amen, trains you to
[1:09:19] have divine dependence.
[1:09:23] Well, like David, you can say, "Amen. I
[1:09:26] look to the hill
[1:09:28] from where cometh my help. My help
[1:09:31] cometh from the Lord who made heaven and
[1:09:35] earth." Now I understand. It's not what
[1:09:38] I know. It's not what I can do. It is
[1:09:41] what God will help me
[1:09:44] to accomplish.
[1:09:46] Even Paul, he had to go through the
[1:09:49] desert of
[1:09:52] after his encounter,
[1:09:54] not to be punished,
[1:09:57] but to be processed.
[1:10:01] Some of you are going through your
[1:10:02] desert,
[1:10:05] don't think it is bad.
[1:10:08] Don't think bad about that fear trial
[1:10:12] because according to God's purpose in
[1:10:14] your life,
[1:10:16] he's processing you
[1:10:19] and the process is different.
[1:10:22] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. It depends on
[1:10:24] what you want to make.
[1:10:28] Amen. If you want to make a thinner
[1:10:30] paper or a bigger paper or whatever,
[1:10:33] the machine will be different and the
[1:10:35] process will be different. Don't you
[1:10:38] ever be uh you know envious
[1:10:42] of what others have. Oh, God.
[1:10:49] What about me? Oh, come on. Enjoy the
[1:10:52] process.
[1:10:54] God is preparing you for a cow, right?
[1:10:59] But for a better person,
[1:11:04] God is preparing you
[1:11:06] according to your his purpose in your
[1:11:09] life.
[1:11:13] The process is different.
[1:11:16] Struggle is all right.
[1:11:19] It's God is secret workshop.
[1:11:23] The prophet said in possessing the
[1:11:24] enemy's case
[1:11:26] was only a few years later when the
[1:11:28] trials come
[1:11:30] and the church got all shook.
[1:11:33] And as is so easy for a congregation of
[1:11:35] people to do when something just don't
[1:11:37] seem to happen the way that it should be
[1:11:39] that it's supposed to be.
[1:11:46] God makes it that way.
[1:11:48] God brings tensions into the church,
[1:11:53] tensions into the family, tensions into
[1:11:56] relationship,
[1:11:57] tensions into your heart, tensions into
[1:12:00] your life.
[1:12:02] Every son
[1:12:04] that cometh to God
[1:12:06] must be tried
[1:12:09] and proven,
[1:12:11] tested.
[1:12:13] He le sickness strike you.
[1:12:16] He lets disease come on you
[1:12:19] and test you and prove you and show the
[1:12:23] world
[1:12:25] that you are truly the seed of Abraham.
[1:12:29] He permits it by his own will.
[1:12:37] Hallelujah. He permits disaster.
[1:12:41] He permits the friends to turn against
[1:12:43] you.
[1:12:45] He permits all these things
[1:12:48] and turns the devils loose
[1:12:51] to tempt you.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:12:57] And he will do all
[1:12:59] I take your life.
[1:13:02] Why are you still alive? You are alive
[1:13:06] because you have a purpose.
[1:13:08] Regardless of what has happened in your
[1:13:10] life, regardless of what you think was
[1:13:13] bad,
[1:13:14] let me tell you, there is a purpose.
[1:13:18] The fact that you are alive and you can
[1:13:21] hear the word.
[1:13:23] Amen. Don't put your eyes on what
[1:13:26] happened before.
[1:13:29] The Bible says putting off your eyes
[1:13:32] from that and you look to what is
[1:13:35] coming.
[1:13:37] Look to what God promising his word
[1:13:40] concerning your life because purpose
[1:13:44] always looks to vision
[1:13:48] is always the end goal.
[1:13:51] What will happen?
[1:13:53] After the trial
[1:13:56] after the struggle,
[1:13:58] my brother, we are going somewhere.
[1:14:01] My sisters, let me tell you, this is not
[1:14:03] your end. You are going somewhere. As
[1:14:07] long as you are alive, you are going
[1:14:10] somewhere. There is a target to him.
[1:14:13] There is a purpose to accomplish.
[1:14:16] Don't give up. Look at the purpose.
[1:14:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; He could throw you on a bed of
[1:14:26] affliction.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; He could turn your neighbors against
[1:14:29] you.
[1:14:31] He could turn the church against you.
[1:14:34] Amen. He can do most anything.
[1:14:39] That's why you must never hate.
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:45] I feel like jumping right
[1:14:48] because I feel like I I have to be. I
[1:14:49] don't know where.
[1:14:51] Why I'm speaking friends is coming from
[1:14:53] another dimension.
[1:14:55] That's why you have to love everybody.
[1:14:58] Don't hate anybody because if they did
[1:15:01] something to you, it was God who allowed
[1:15:07] Joseph turned to his brethren and told
[1:15:09] them, "Hey, my brother, you think you
[1:15:12] sowed me?"
[1:15:14] No, no, no, no. God himself
[1:15:18] sent me here.
[1:15:21] Hallelujah.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; But they even got money pieces of sh.
[1:15:27] But Joseph is telling them, "It was not
[1:15:29] you, my brother. It was God.
[1:15:33] So it was not your brother. It was not
[1:15:35] your sister. It was God who allowed it
[1:15:39] for a purpose."
[1:15:44] Amen. Amen. He could throw you into
[1:15:46] anything.
[1:15:47] He can do most anything
[1:15:57] good and bad.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And it is it is God's will
[1:16:04] for him to do it.
[1:16:07] We are told that it is more precious
[1:16:10] than gold
[1:16:13] to us.
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:17] So the struggle is where God's
[1:16:18] leadership over our lives is proven.
[1:16:24] That's where purpose becomes character.
[1:16:28] And character is what holds the
[1:16:30] anointing
[1:16:33] because God gives you the anointing for
[1:16:34] your purpose.
[1:16:37] But you need character.
[1:16:39] Without character, that anointing can
[1:16:42] kill you.
[1:16:44] You need character before the anointing
[1:16:47] comes. So then God will allow you to go
[1:16:50] through things
[1:16:53] before he anoints you.
[1:16:56] So have a clean heart.
[1:17:00] Look at Joseph. He told his brothers,
[1:17:03] "Don't be guilty.
[1:17:06] It's not you, it's God.
[1:17:08] Look at David. When this man came
[1:17:11] stoning him,
[1:17:14] God wanted to kill him, they said, "No,
[1:17:17] no, no. Don't do that. God has permitted
[1:17:21] him, to abuse me, to stone me. Who am I
[1:17:26] to go against God?"
[1:17:29] His heart was pure. To the pure, all
[1:17:33] things are pure.
[1:17:36] Look at Jesus when they stoned him and
[1:17:39] they killed and they beat him and they
[1:17:42] spotted him and they called him. They
[1:17:46] called him the devil himself.
[1:17:49] He never had a beaten heart.
[1:17:52] He forgave them. Why? He in him was
[1:17:56] purity.
[1:17:58] In him was life.
[1:18:01] Look at Steven when they stoned him. and
[1:18:04] tried to kill him. He he was able to see
[1:18:07] the big picture.
[1:18:11] And he said, "God, forgive them. They
[1:18:15] don't know what they're doing." My
[1:18:17] brother, my sister, when you when your
[1:18:19] mind opens to another mind,
[1:18:23] to revelation,
[1:18:25] you will cease to see things naturally.
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:29] Whatever happens around you, you will
[1:18:32] always have one scripture in your mind.
[1:18:34] And I know for all things, all things
[1:18:39] work together for good. Amen. Why?
[1:18:42] Because I am the call
[1:18:45] according to his purpose.
[1:18:48] Because if Steven
[1:18:51] had not said, I forgive them,
[1:18:53] father, forgive them, soul would not
[1:18:56] have been saved.
[1:18:58] and you would not have been healed.
[1:19:01] So it was all God's purpose
[1:19:04] that Stephen will die and he will become
[1:19:07] a matter
[1:19:09] that Saul will believe and he will
[1:19:12] become Paul and he'll preach the gospel
[1:19:15] and today we can talk about Jesus
[1:19:19] and say we want to be like him.
[1:19:22] It is all God is great big
[1:19:29] s what has happened to you I am here to
[1:19:33] tell you
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; oh my god I remember when the angel
[1:19:38] comes when he came to brother he said
[1:19:42] I've come to speak to you about your
[1:19:45] misunderstood life
[1:19:48] and I'm also telling you what is
[1:19:50] happening to you is all part of God in
[1:19:54] the big picture.
[1:19:59] No one did anything to you
[1:20:02] that is bad. God permitted it for a
[1:20:05] purpose.
[1:20:07] You never did anything that is bad.
[1:20:13] That's bigger now. Yes. Don't be on this
[1:20:16] good side. Be on the bad side as well.
[1:20:20] Even the things that you did
[1:20:23] that you are not proud of,
[1:20:25] God allowed you to pass through that
[1:20:27] life.
[1:20:29] Why? For the great big picture.
[1:20:33] You open your eyes
[1:20:35] into God's great purpose for your life.
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:42] Then you will stop looking down.
[1:20:45] You will look up shoulders
[1:20:48] and say I am a son of God. I am here to
[1:20:53] fulfill God's divine purpose
[1:20:57] for my life. Praise God.
[1:21:01] Amen.
[1:21:03] The struggle
[1:21:05] identify his true sons.
[1:21:09] A struggle is not a sign of rejection.
[1:21:12] It is a sign of sunship.
[1:21:18] If you are without chastisement,
[1:21:21] the scripture says,
[1:21:24] you are an illegitimate son.
[1:21:29] No sin.
[1:21:33] We all don't want chastisement.
[1:21:36] We don't want to struggle. We don't want
[1:21:38] to go through pain and suffering and
[1:21:40] this and that.
[1:21:41] But the Bible says if you after coming
[1:21:44] to Christ
[1:21:46] don't go through it you are illegitimate
[1:21:51] you are not a son
[1:21:54] you know I've seen many many years I'
[1:21:56] have been preaching the gospel
[1:21:58] that almost when someone comes to Christ
[1:22:01] and they believe that's when their
[1:22:03] family will come up against
[1:22:06] all hell will break loose
[1:22:08] someone told me pastor
[1:22:10] after he baptized me the problems became
[1:22:13] worse
[1:22:14] and the devil is trying to share to tell
[1:22:16] them
[1:22:17] that is a false teaching
[1:22:20] that's why you are suffering and you
[1:22:22] know what God allows that
[1:22:25] so that he will test you
[1:22:31] are you a true son
[1:22:34] or you are an illegitimate
[1:22:37] if you a true son Those trials, those
[1:22:41] sufferings, those struggles will purify
[1:22:44] you. They will embolden you
[1:22:49] into the word.
[1:22:52] It struggles identifies the true son.
[1:22:57] I am in the scriptures. By the way,
[1:23:00] Hebrews 12:7, if you and your chesting,
[1:23:04] God dealeth with you as with sons.
[1:23:09] For what son is he whom the father
[1:23:12] chastiseth not?
[1:23:15] But if ye be without chastisement,
[1:23:19] what are all our partakers
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:28] of
[1:23:30] we are chastised.
[1:23:32] We are partakers of chastisement. If you
[1:23:34] you have ever lived in a home
[1:23:38] We with with children that are born in
[1:23:40] the home and the children who are not.
[1:23:44] You know a true father
[1:23:47] will always call his sons and his
[1:23:50] daughters seriously.
[1:23:55] But this other one he will go slow.
[1:23:59] Why? Because this one will never
[1:24:01] understand.
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:04] He'll just speak and say, "What's wrong
[1:24:06] with you?" And this boy will just say,
[1:24:09] "This man is a monster.
[1:24:11] Take a phone. I'm living with a
[1:24:14] monster."
[1:24:17] So, a true father in the home. If I
[1:24:20] never biologically gave birth to
[1:24:22] somebody,
[1:24:23] I have a limit of correction.
[1:24:27] But to a true son,
[1:24:29] biological son, that one I can scroll. I
[1:24:34] can pull ears. I can sl
[1:24:40] say what have you done. Because even
[1:24:43] after scolding him,
[1:24:46] come back to me.
[1:24:49] I'm sorry. Because even if you feel bad,
[1:24:53] you will never run away from your daddy.
[1:24:56] Look at children. When they sad, they
[1:24:59] run going back to their mommy or their
[1:25:01] daddy. Even after chastisement,
[1:25:04] true son are chastised. Are you a true
[1:25:08] son of God?
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:11] And he says if if you don't have
[1:25:15] chastisement,
[1:25:18] then you are bastards
[1:25:20] and not sons.
[1:25:22] So when you are truly born again,
[1:25:25] God will not let you escape his dealing.
[1:25:31] He will deal with you.
[1:25:35] He will take you through fire
[1:25:40] not to harm you
[1:25:42] but to manifest the goal
[1:25:46] of your faith.
[1:25:48] In church age book Ephesians chapter 8
[1:25:49] says worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[1:25:52] bride of Christ.
[1:25:55] Worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[1:25:56] bride of Christ.
[1:25:59] And as gold is malleable,
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; whereas brass will break with the bent
[1:26:06] beating.
[1:26:10] This God of God,
[1:26:13] hello God of God,
[1:26:16] Hallelujah. Amen. This God of God
[1:26:20] will bear her suffering for the Lord.
[1:26:24] Not bowed,
[1:26:27] not broken,
[1:26:29] not destroyed,
[1:26:31] but formed
[1:26:34] as a thing of beauty and joy
[1:26:38] forever by the trials and testings of
[1:26:40] this life.
[1:26:44] If you are the God of God,
[1:26:46] you must go through that.
[1:26:50] That's why before your purpose manifest,
[1:26:53] your faith must be proven genuine.
[1:26:58] The struggle exposes what is real
[1:27:03] and burns away what is artificial.
[1:27:08] We can't go in by pretending.
[1:27:12] We have to go in in reality.
[1:27:16] If we came from there, we have to go
[1:27:18] back to our true origin.
[1:27:21] Not by pretense,
[1:27:23] but in reality.
[1:27:26] You see, purpose without process
[1:27:30] produces pride.
[1:27:32] You see, in the natural, a child born
[1:27:34] before its time
[1:27:38] is premature,
[1:27:40] you know, is weak, unable to survive
[1:27:43] outside the womb.
[1:27:46] And you know spiritually it's the same
[1:27:47] thing.
[1:27:49] If God were to bring you into your
[1:27:51] purpose
[1:27:54] without first taking you through the
[1:27:56] process,
[1:27:58] that purpose itself will destroy you.
[1:28:03] The Bible says in Hebrews 5:8, "Though
[1:28:07] he were a son,
[1:28:10] yet lending he obedience by the things
[1:28:11] which he
[1:28:14] speaking of Christ."
[1:28:17] Philippians 2:8. And being found in a
[1:28:19] fashion as a man,
[1:28:22] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:28:25] unto death.
[1:28:28] He became obedient.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; How? by the things which
[1:28:35] don't think Jesus just obey to die.
[1:28:41] He had to suffer.
[1:28:44] He had to be molded into that kind
[1:28:47] to obey death.
[1:28:50] This is somebody who was a son of God.
[1:28:54] He could speak
[1:28:57] another word and disappear.
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; He was God in flesh.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you something?
[1:29:06] You are like him. Hallelujah.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; The potentials he have,
[1:29:12] you have.
[1:29:14] But you have to suffer like he suffered.
[1:29:18] So you can reign with him.
[1:29:22] Hallelujah. You see, he obeyed unto
[1:29:25] death. Even the death of the cross.
[1:29:29] Wherefore God also highly exalted him?
[1:29:34] After what
[1:29:37] suffering
[1:29:39] and given him a name which is above
[1:29:42] every name
[1:29:44] [Music]
[1:29:47] that's why weakness
[1:29:50] proceed precedes strength.
[1:29:56] Praise God.
[1:29:58] Strength comes after weakness.
[1:30:03] Weakness first then strength. The
[1:30:06] struggle humbles you
[1:30:09] so that when the purpose come,
[1:30:12] God alone
[1:30:15] receives glory.
[1:30:17] Some of you cannot get promotion
[1:30:21] because there is still more character
[1:30:24] molding to do.
[1:30:28] Some of you can get a job
[1:30:31] because there is still character mold in
[1:30:33] you.
[1:30:36] Some of you cannot get married
[1:30:40] because there is still character mode.
[1:30:43] Some of you can get money to buy a
[1:30:45] house, buy a car. Whatever you think you
[1:30:48] need, whatever you think you are
[1:30:50] entitled to,
[1:30:53] there's more character molding.
[1:30:57] You feel you have a calling of God,
[1:31:00] ministry or whatever it is, but you're
[1:31:02] not quite getting it because there is
[1:31:05] still character molding.
[1:31:08] And that's the bitter being.
[1:31:11] But church, I'm asking you to swallow
[1:31:13] it.
[1:31:18] Submit yourself
[1:31:20] to the will of God
[1:31:22] in every struggles of life.
[1:31:26] Don't ever see it as negative.
[1:31:30] Learn to thank God and stop complaining.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Philippians 2, I'm about to say
[1:31:40] Philippians 2:9. Wherefore God also has
[1:31:44] exalted him
[1:31:46] and given him a name above all name
[1:31:49] which is that at the name of Jesus
[1:31:52] every knee should bow of things in
[1:31:54] heaven and things in earth and things
[1:31:56] under the earth and that every tongue
[1:32:00] should confess that Jesus Christ
[1:32:04] to the glory of God the father.
[1:32:07] Now even the Lord Jesus did not escape
[1:32:11] this process.
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:14] Though he was the word made flesh,
[1:32:17] he learned obedience
[1:32:20] by the things which he suffered. Before
[1:32:22] the resurrection came,
[1:32:25] Gethsemane
[1:32:28] happened
[1:32:29] before the crown came
[1:32:33] the cross.
[1:32:34] All of us know that
[1:32:37] but we don't want to carry our cross.
[1:32:40] He says carry your cross
[1:32:43] and we have different crosses.
[1:32:46] If that was the path of the pattern of
[1:32:48] of the pattern son
[1:32:54] how much more his many membered body.
[1:33:00] So when the bride goes through
[1:33:01] suffering,
[1:33:04] it's not punishment.
[1:33:06] God is not punishing you.
[1:33:08] It is identification with the world.
[1:33:13] When the purpose of God is about to
[1:33:14] unfold,
[1:33:17] let me tell you what happens. The enemy
[1:33:20] will fall pressure.
[1:33:24] You can say I've suffered.
[1:33:26] But when you reach a moment and say I
[1:33:29] have suffered enough
[1:33:33] that is the moment don't give up
[1:33:38] things about to happen.
[1:33:41] When you reach that moment of saying
[1:33:44] enough is enough.
[1:33:46] It mean you are reaching a moment of
[1:33:50] your of the manifestation of your
[1:33:52] purpose.
[1:33:57] the closer Joseph came to the palace,
[1:34:02] the darker it looked.
[1:34:05] The closer Jesus came to Calvary,
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; you remember the cross became heavier.
[1:34:15] Hallelujah. And the devil was speaking
[1:34:17] to him, "Give up. Give up. Give up."
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; But I'm God so glad he never gave up.
[1:34:25] And because he never gave up, I will not
[1:34:28] give up. Hallelujah. I will carry my
[1:34:31] cross
[1:34:33] and I will follow Jesus.
[1:34:36] Hallelujah.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; While you are there murmuring
[1:34:40] that, oh, I'm not married.
[1:34:43] There is someone married
[1:34:45] for 20 years without a child.
[1:34:48] And whereas you are saying, oh, I'm here
[1:34:51] 10 years without a child.
[1:34:53] There is someone who has children every
[1:34:55] year and they die every year.
[1:34:58] Stop murmuring.
[1:35:01] Just focus on the purpose.
[1:35:04] Whatever your cross is my brother, my
[1:35:07] sister, bear your cross.
[1:35:10] Follow Christ
[1:35:12] without memory.
[1:35:14] That's the law of contrast.
[1:35:16] The dark hour, the darkest hour
[1:35:21] just before dawn. Hallelujah.
[1:35:27] The Bible says he sit us in the thickest
[1:35:29] of darkness.
[1:35:33] Well, if you think you're in that
[1:35:34] moment,
[1:35:36] he's about to show
[1:35:39] it's about to become a new morning.
[1:35:42] Oh, God.
[1:35:47] Stop crying like a child.
[1:35:50] Start believing and confessing
[1:35:53] victory in the middle of your struggle.
[1:35:58] Hallelujah.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I know I'm I'm a bit off for
[1:36:03] Zoom, but I'm finishing in 5 minutes
[1:36:08] because I know you're being blessed by
[1:36:10] this.
[1:36:12] Praise God. Even as you look away to
[1:36:14] Jesus, it's tightening. He says, "And
[1:36:18] when that time comes and the press comes
[1:36:21] to a place to where you are pressed out,
[1:36:26] then watch what I'm I'm fixing to tell
[1:36:27] you.
[1:36:29] Watch the third pull."
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:33] In other words, the greatest
[1:36:35] manifestation
[1:36:38] of purpose
[1:36:40] which is Christ in his bride
[1:36:43] comes also through pressure.
[1:36:48] Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] The struggle is not the end.
[1:36:54] It's the signal that manifestation is
[1:36:56] near.
[1:36:59] A true believer doesn't inter interpret
[1:37:02] their life by circumstances
[1:37:09] but by the word.
[1:37:11] The struggle is not random.
[1:37:15] It is scriptural design.
[1:37:22] If you can see that your hardship is
[1:37:23] God's hand,
[1:37:27] shaping his purpose
[1:37:30] in your life.
[1:37:32] Then you will stop muring.
[1:37:36] You will you will start yielding.
[1:37:41] You are going to be available
[1:37:44] when everything is good. You'll be
[1:37:46] available when things are bad.
[1:37:50] When the grain is threshed,
[1:37:53] it's not destroyed.
[1:37:58] It is separated from the chaff.
[1:38:02] You know,
[1:38:05] it doesn't mean you're destroying it.
[1:38:08] You are going to begin the work of
[1:38:09] separation,
[1:38:12] the chaff from the wind.
[1:38:15] So let the struggle do its work.
[1:38:21] It is producing a vessel
[1:38:26] fit for the master.
[1:38:37] You know they take it and beat it and
[1:38:39] beat it.
[1:38:42] It's a separation going on.
[1:38:46] This struggle is here for the master's
[1:38:50] use.
[1:38:52] Let us stand on our feet.
[1:38:55] Hallelujah.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[1:38:58] these words that have been spoken today.
[1:39:01] Lord, perhaps it was for somebody.
[1:39:05] Oh Jesus,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; would you help us to no longer look at
[1:39:11] what is happening, the circumstances,
[1:39:16] May we look at the purpose.
[1:39:18] There is a purpose in me
[1:39:21] that must manifest.
[1:39:23] Lord Jesus,
[1:39:25] help me to understand.
[1:39:28] Help me to see, oh God, beyond
[1:39:32] what is around me and do so for my
[1:39:36] brother, my sister.
[1:39:38] Bring them to that realization
[1:39:40] that mammaring is not the answer.
[1:39:44] Crying is not the answer. Self-pity is
[1:39:46] not the answer.
[1:39:49] But faith,
[1:39:51] hallelujah,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; is the answer.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; No matter what happens that their eyes
[1:39:58] are stayed on the purpose
[1:40:01] that they can be all together be able to
[1:40:03] say.
[1:40:05] And we know that for all things work
[1:40:08] together for good to those that love
[1:40:14] and are the cold
[1:40:16] we know all things, not something but
[1:40:20] all things. Bless everyone Lord. And as
[1:40:23] we dismiss tonight, may your presence
[1:40:25] dwell there.
[1:40:28] Grant it I pray
[1:40:30] in Jesus name.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:39] Let us sing one or two songs so we can
[1:40:41] worship him a little bit and before we
[1:40:43] give our offerings,
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; oh Lord,
[1:40:54] surround
[1:40:57] me,

[1:42:19] me.
[1:42:20] Oh Lord,

[1:42:33] And let your presence,
[1:42:36] let your presence
[1:42:39] feel
[1:42:41] this place.
[1:42:43] Tell him one more time. Surround me.
[1:42:48] Hallelujah.
[1:42:50] Hallelujah.
[1:42:53] Oh, surround me.

[1:45:41] Thank you for reminding us we should
[1:45:44] stop murmmoring.
[1:45:46] We should stop looking to the left or to
[1:45:48] the right. We should focus on your word,
[1:45:52] on your promises. Amen. We should focus
[1:45:55] on what you have said in your word for
[1:45:57] us,
[1:46:00] the purpose that you have for our lives.
[1:46:04] Lord, may you help us, oh God. Help
[1:46:07] Abra, every brother, every sister. We
[1:46:10] will come into that place.
[1:46:12] Amen. Of confidence.
[1:46:14] Confidence.
[1:46:16] No matter what happens in our life, we
[1:46:19] should have confidence in your purpose.
[1:46:22] Knowing you can never fail us for
[1:46:25] no matter what happens in this life. We
[1:46:28] are being molded Lord into that stature
[1:46:33] of a perfect man.
[1:46:36] Help us Lord Jesus that we will go day

[1:46:45] looking unto the mark of the pride.

[1:46:57] person, Lord. Help each and every one of
