[1:38:02] 4 God thank you musicians that will be
[1:38:05] all the singing for for today
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:08] so just uh taking from verses
[1:38:16] one so the service today the Lord
[1:38:18] willing will be a teaching service
[1:38:20] service
[1:38:24] I the Lord willing because I'm not that
[1:38:25] much of a
[1:38:28] teacher but just to get a few Basics and
[1:38:32] uh of our
[1:38:34] foundational uh truths here in the
[1:38:41] Bible that I desire that we share
[1:38:44] together with
[1:38:46] you we read from verse
[1:38:50] one
[1:38:52] so I appreciate if you can if you have a
[1:38:54] pen and maybe you have a question just
[1:38:56] write it
[1:39:01] down and then after the service we can
[1:39:04] always you know you can always approach
[1:39:05] me and we can go through
[1:39:10] those so we are reading from verse
[1:39:14] one behold the day cometh that shall
[1:39:16] burn as an oven and all the proud yeah
[1:39:19] and all that do wickedly shall be tble
[1:39:21] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[1:39:24] up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall
[1:39:27] leave them neither root no
[1:39:48] Branch so this day is coming and it is
[1:39:52] coming because God said it is
[1:39:54] coming so you better believe it is
[1:39:57] coming whether you believe it or not it
[1:39:59] is coming
[1:40:01] anyway how many believe that day is
[1:40:04] coming that means we should prepare
[1:40:08] ourselves unto you that fear my name
[1:40:11] shall the son of righteousness arise
[1:40:13] with healing in his wings and he shall
[1:40:15] go forth and grow up as calves of the
[1:40:19] store
[1:40:31] and ye shall trade down the wicked for
[1:40:33] they shall be ashes Under The Souls of
[1:40:36] your feet in the day that I shall do
[1:40:39] this sayith the Lord of
[1:40:44] [Music]
[1:40:49] HS
[1:40:52] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[1:40:54] which I commanded unto him in Horeb for
[1:40:56] all Israel with the statutes and
[1:41:09] judgments behold I will send you Elijah
[1:41:12] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:41:14] great and Dreadful day of the
[1:41:19] Lord
[1:41:25] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:41:28] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[1:41:30] the children to their fathers lest I
[1:41:33] come and smite the Earth with a
[1:41:44] curse you may be seated God bless you
[1:41:46] and bless the reading of your
[1:41:49] word
[1:41:56] so we have been dealing with the subject
[1:41:58] of the ministry of Elijah in the end
[1:42:04] time and I think that this is a part
[1:42:10] six but really most of all the other
[1:42:13] parts we've been looking at the ministry
[1:42:15] of Elijah itself in the
[1:42:19] beginning
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:24] so I am requesting that you kindly give
[1:42:25] me your undivided
[1:42:29] attention try to uh minimize movement as
[1:42:32] much as
[1:42:35] possible so that the the thought which
[1:42:37] will not be so long can be projected to
[1:42:39] you
[1:42:43] properly after the service we are going
[1:42:44] to have a um a meeting with the
[1:42:47] committee members for the Youth uh uh
[1:42:51] our youth
[1:42:57] meetings and I know I'm also meeting a
[1:42:59] few people for cancer so I will not
[1:43:01] delay
[1:43:06] in so I just want us to be together one
[1:43:11] mind don't do on me don't sleep on
[1:43:14] me and just have your Bible
[1:43:17] handy how many have this book
[1:43:21] how many need
[1:43:24] it okay so everybody
[1:43:27] has I hope everybody
[1:43:30] has so this is a a little booklet we
[1:43:33] have been uh Distributing for some time
[1:43:39] now around the
[1:43:42] country it's called the five comings of
[1:43:47] Elijah just 17 pages
[1:43:52] everyone can read
[1:43:53] it in less than one
[1:43:56] hour even the poor
[1:43:59] reader if you're very very very poor
[1:44:02] reader maybe in two hours
[1:44:05] Maxim if you're a good reader in just 15
[1:44:09] to 30 minutes you'll be
[1:44:12] done just very few
[1:44:15] pages really like a
[1:44:19] track about the five comings of
[1:44:24] Elijah and so brother Tim wrote this
[1:44:30] book and I had also um recorded a
[1:44:36] video the five comings of elij and I was
[1:44:39] thinking of putting it into book
[1:44:42] format and I noticed by the team put had
[1:44:45] already written
[1:44:47] this so I I I asked him to give it to me
[1:44:51] so we also translated it into
[1:44:55] ruganda and it's been going around the
[1:44:57] whole
[1:44:59] country there are many who even don't
[1:45:02] know this message that I've received
[1:45:03] this little
[1:45:06] booklet really much of this teaching on
[1:45:10] Elijah's
[1:45:12] Ministry you will find it in this book
[1:45:15] with all the
[1:45:17] scriptures all the
[1:45:19] explanations so you can clearly
[1:45:24] understand uh and for you who are not
[1:45:26] good at reading and just want to listen
[1:45:28] we have a video recorded on that as
[1:45:35] well I think I also um we did it in
[1:45:39] Ethiopia in
[1:45:42] Amar also with we did one here with the
[1:45:45] luganda
[1:45:48] version should be on our Channel
[1:45:52] of the on the YouTube on the days of the
[1:45:53] voice channel so
[1:45:55] YouTube what I'm trying to
[1:45:57] say is when we come in the
[1:46:00] church sometimes you preach things and
[1:46:02] you think everybody has
[1:46:06] understood but not usually I've learned
[1:46:08] over the years not everybody understands
[1:46:10] everything you're
[1:46:14] saying so you have to keep repeating it
[1:46:16] repeating it and repeating
[1:46:19] it and sometimes I've noticed you also
[1:46:22] need to uh put it in small bits and
[1:46:25] pieces where people can be able to break
[1:46:27] it down and understand
[1:46:32] it so that's why we have those videos we
[1:46:36] have and many forms where people can be
[1:46:38] able to
[1:46:41] understand and really be able to to be
[1:46:44] helped to study this in the
[1:46:48] Bible fully are fully Bible
[1:46:52] Church where every teaching we teach is
[1:46:54] based on the
[1:46:57] scriptures and we believe that the
[1:46:59] scriptures are enough for our
[1:47:03] salvation and it is in the scriptures
[1:47:05] that we learn about the ministry of
[1:47:10] Elijah and we notice that the ministry
[1:47:13] as we have come as we have been seeing
[1:47:15] for now about six
[1:47:19] services
[1:47:21] the ministry of
[1:47:24] Elijah uh did not only work at the time
[1:47:27] of Elijah when he was on
[1:47:31] Earth it is also going to work in it is
[1:47:33] Promised or prophesied to work in the
[1:47:36] end time
[1:47:41] also but there is only one man that came
[1:47:45] that was called
[1:47:48] Elijah and we have started his ministry
[1:47:51] or gone through his ministry these past
[1:47:55] Services we have seen everything Elijah
[1:47:59] did from pronouncing a
[1:48:02] drought you know to feeding you know to
[1:48:04] being fed by Ravens and and the Ang of
[1:48:06] the
[1:48:08] Lord you know providing flour and and
[1:48:12] oil to the
[1:48:15] woman all these were Supernatural occur
[1:48:17] occurrences in his
[1:48:19] ministry
[1:48:22] you know he slaughtered the prophets of
[1:48:24] B when he took them to The Showdown to
[1:48:27] prove for them to prove whether their
[1:48:29] God was the true one or whether his God
[1:48:31] was the right
[1:48:35] one and he said the god that will answer
[1:48:38] by fire and consume the sacrifice will
[1:48:40] be the right the right
[1:48:46] God their God was
[1:48:49] silent they prophesied they cut
[1:48:52] themselves they jumped up and down they
[1:48:54] shouted but their God was
[1:48:56] silent so it is from that we learn it's
[1:48:59] not about the shouting the dancing all
[1:49:02] that kind of
[1:49:06] thing it's about having the principles
[1:49:12] right so the god of Elijah is about is
[1:49:15] the god of
[1:49:18] restoration of the principle of
[1:49:22] God of the principles of the
[1:49:25] word the god of Elijah puts everything
[1:49:28] in
[1:49:29] order and then when he calls the
[1:49:32] fire fire comes down not because Elijah
[1:49:36] called the fire but because the time was
[1:49:40] right it was the time of the
[1:49:44] evening which was the time of the
[1:49:46] offering of the evening
[1:49:49] sacrifice
[1:49:50] and then the altar which was messed up
[1:49:54] initially was also prepared properly by
[1:49:58] Elijah and then now we can call
[1:50:01] God and when God comes
[1:50:04] down you know he has to prove that he's
[1:50:06] with
[1:50:08] Elijah and you see the other prophets of
[1:50:12] Bal were ashamed and Elijah slaughtered
[1:50:15] all of
[1:50:17] them you know because their God was not
[1:50:22] and we also notic he prayed and Rain
[1:50:25] came
[1:50:26] down and we also notice that he prayed
[1:50:29] and rain
[1:50:31] stop for three and a half
[1:50:34] years my God I love the the god of
[1:50:38] Elijah because the god of Elijah is the
[1:50:41] god of
[1:50:43] [Music]
[1:50:45] action is the god of
[1:50:48] action not the god of
[1:50:51] words the god of
[1:50:53] action he makes things
[1:50:57] happen so he said it will not
[1:51:00] rain and it did not rain for three
[1:51:03] years let me tell you that is power to
[1:51:08] bind just like Jesus said in the Book of
[1:51:11] Matthew that whatsoever you will bind on
[1:51:15] Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:51:18] whatsoever you lose on Earth
[1:51:20] shall be loed in heaven so Elijah had
[1:51:23] power to
[1:51:24] bind and Elijah had power to
[1:51:27] lose are you following me so we also
[1:51:30] notice that he prophesied the death of
[1:51:33] Jezebel Jezebel was a
[1:51:36] prophet who had lifted herself
[1:51:41] above the word of God but Elijah
[1:51:45] prophesied that she would
[1:51:47] die and Elijah went on he did many
[1:51:49] things
[1:51:51] we can see that his ministry was a
[1:51:53] powerful
[1:51:55] Ministry and actually if you compare him
[1:51:58] with all the prophets of the Old
[1:52:01] Testament he had an outstanding
[1:52:06] Ministry you know he raised a dead child
[1:52:08] back to
[1:52:09] life you know you know I can go on and
[1:52:12] on and on talking about his is many
[1:52:17] exploits so let me put it this way the
[1:52:21] god of
[1:52:22] Elijah is a god of
[1:52:25] restoration the god of Elijah is a god
[1:52:28] of life is a God who prepares things and
[1:52:33] brings back life where there has been
[1:52:36] death you know and also life was
[1:52:39] restored where death
[1:52:42] abounds the only thing that was
[1:52:47] required after Elijah had set everything
[1:52:50] in
[1:52:52] order was for him to
[1:52:59] speak for yes was for him to speak and
[1:53:02] and at the sounding of his
[1:53:05] voice God came
[1:53:08] down are you following
[1:53:11] me now in the times of course we we have
[1:53:15] also been able to look at the times when
[1:53:17] Elijah
[1:53:18] came
[1:53:21] it was a time when Ahab was the king of
[1:53:26] Israel and notice that at that time
[1:53:30] Israel had been divided
[1:53:34] already and and Ahab went after other
[1:53:39] gods just like the other kings before
[1:53:42] him and God displeased go because he
[1:53:44] went and married an
[1:53:47] unbeliever actually he married a PRI
[1:53:50] a a priest's
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:53:54] daughter a priest who believed a priest
[1:53:57] of
[1:53:58] B his name
[1:54:01] was and he expected that you know he
[1:54:04] would still worship His
[1:54:08] God but because he married the PRI of
[1:54:11] daughter of an
[1:54:14] unbeliever he ended up sanctioning the
[1:54:17] building of the temples of B in
[1:54:25] Israel that if you marry an
[1:54:29] unbeliever there is no way you can
[1:54:31] worship the true
[1:54:34] God and that's why Believers always
[1:54:36] matter
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:39] Believers we are the younger
[1:54:42] men can we say Amen to
[1:54:45] that only
[1:54:48] the the young
[1:54:54] ladies is that a young
[1:54:56] lady Believers always Mar
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:00] Believers because if you don't do
[1:55:02] that you end up worshiping other
[1:55:09] gods now these other people were serving
[1:55:11] their
[1:55:13] God and they thought their God was a
[1:55:15] living
[1:55:17] God I want to ask you
[1:55:20] question why do you think these people
[1:55:24] were ready to go for on a showdown with
[1:55:29] Elijah do you think they doubted their
[1:55:33] gods they actually believed their
[1:55:36] God they believe their God will answer
[1:55:39] with
[1:55:41] fire maybe in the past they had seen
[1:55:43] their gods do something for
[1:55:47] them but you see I want to tell you when
[1:55:51] we preach when we talk about the
[1:55:54] message when we talk about the end time
[1:55:57] message and we said the end time message
[1:55:59] is the right truth is the
[1:56:03] truth it does not mean that God is Not
[1:56:08] elsewhere no please I want you to hear
[1:56:11] me
[1:56:12] clearly it does not mean God is Not
[1:56:16] elsewhere God is
[1:56:18] everywhere and some of these people pray
[1:56:21] some of them have
[1:56:23] gifts some of them they have seen God
[1:56:26] work for
[1:56:27] them and there's no way you can prove to
[1:56:29] them that what they have is not the
[1:56:33] truth but listen to me when Elijah comes
[1:56:36] on the
[1:56:37] scene he does not come to debate with
[1:56:41] anybody because for him is a
[1:56:45] prophet not just somebody with a gift of
[1:56:48] Prophecy
[1:56:50] but he is a
[1:56:53] prophet do you know the difference
[1:56:55] between a prophet and somebody with a
[1:56:56] gift of
[1:57:00] Prophecy somebody who has a gift of
[1:57:04] Prophecy can tell a few
[1:57:06] prophecies and he may never tell them
[1:57:09] again he may never prophesy again or he
[1:57:13] can you know some of the prophets may
[1:57:14] even
[1:57:16] fail but let me tell you when we come to
[1:57:19] a
[1:57:20] prophet he is born a
[1:57:23] prophet he is a prophet from the time
[1:57:26] he's in his mother's
[1:57:28] womb and when he comes on the
[1:57:31] seene not one of his prophecies can
[1:57:36] fail why because he's born a
[1:57:40] prophet so even if they reject him his
[1:57:44] prophecy still
[1:57:46] holds now Elijah was rejected
[1:57:50] he came to a place where he even went
[1:57:51] and started
[1:57:53] crying he said Lord I'm left
[1:57:57] alone left alone everybody has gone
[1:58:01] toship but God told him no elah that's
[1:58:05] not
[1:58:05] true there are
[1:58:07] others
[1:58:09] 7,000 who have not bowed and need to
[1:58:13] Bow and there was a prophet I think H uh
[1:58:16] his name was called um uh what what is
[1:58:19] the name of this Prophet uh I think it
[1:58:24] was what it did he was just very busy
[1:58:27] hiding the prophets of
[1:58:29] God hiding them in
[1:58:32] caves and Elijah never knew about
[1:58:35] them so listen Elijah was
[1:58:40] one one man in the hands of
[1:58:43] God there were other true
[1:58:46] prophets but God used only one man
[1:58:51] Elijah for a Ministry of
[1:58:55] restoration one man in a
[1:58:57] generation and he stood he was one man
[1:59:00] versus all the
[1:59:04] prophets Ministry never
[1:59:07] failed and wherever it was
[1:59:10] received his ministry brought
[1:59:14] Prosperity are you following me now
[1:59:16] wherever the Min of Elijah went
[1:59:20] and was
[1:59:21] accepted Prosperity
[1:59:23] followed where there was death life came
[1:59:27] on the where there was no food food was
[1:59:31] provided where there was no hope Hope
[1:59:35] was restored now that is the ministry of
[1:59:38] Elijah the ministry of Elijah brings
[1:59:43] healing the healing of
[1:59:46] God on his
[1:59:48] wings follow me closely here just trying
[1:59:51] to lay foundation for
[1:59:53] you so now Elijah was
[1:59:58] rejected and uh at the end of his
[2:00:03] ministry everything he said
[2:00:07] happened Jezebel
[2:00:10] died and until you know he he spoke rain
[2:00:14] never
[2:00:17] came he was a prophet of
[2:00:21] God and now that is the Old
[2:00:25] Testament so in the portion of scripture
[2:00:27] where we have read
[2:00:29] today there is a another
[2:00:36] prophecy for Behold a day come that
[2:00:39] shall burn as
[2:00:45] anen and all the proud and all that do
[2:00:48] wickedly shall be and the day that come
[2:00:50] shall bur them up say the Lord of
[2:00:56] host I want you to
[2:00:59] understand that the prophecy
[2:01:03] here is speaking of the end
[2:01:07] time let me ask you a question the day
[2:01:10] that is the day that shall burn as an
[2:01:14] oven has it come
[2:01:18] yet
[2:01:21] so it has not yet
[2:01:22] come now this prophecy was given by
[2:01:26] Prophet
[2:01:28] Mal and it is the last book in the
[2:01:33] oldest and you know prophets when they
[2:01:36] prophesy they don't speak on their
[2:01:39] own they speak according to what God has
[2:01:42] told
[2:01:44] them was
[2:01:48] see the day is
[2:01:51] coming over I want to say that day is
[2:01:55] coming
[2:01:56] still if the prophet Mal saw it I want
[2:01:59] to say it must
[2:02:02] happen tell your neighbor it must
[2:02:05] happen it must
[2:02:07] happen it must
[2:02:09] happen because God said
[2:02:12] so the day of judgment must
[2:02:15] happen and the day when we say the day
[2:02:17] of judgment
[2:02:20] the day the judgments of
[2:02:23] God they don't begin only on the last
[2:02:27] white Throne
[2:02:32] judgment the day of Judgment of
[2:02:35] God really listen to me begin after the
[2:02:41] Rapture because after the Rapture of the
[2:02:44] Church of the
[2:02:47] Bride there comes a
[2:02:51] tribulation the
[2:02:53] tribulation is not an easy
[2:02:57] time it's not a good
[2:02:59] time people who will remain
[2:03:03] here they will
[2:03:05] suffer call that the judgments of
[2:03:09] God it will be a time of
[2:03:13] tribulation and then we know that the
[2:03:16] Bible says all that do wicked shall be
[2:03:22] stubble that day shall burn them
[2:03:26] up and we know that there is coming what
[2:03:29] we call the third world
[2:03:33] war are you hearing what is happening
[2:03:36] today in in
[2:03:39] Israel you know some people think that
[2:03:42] these things are just
[2:03:44] happening everything is in
[2:03:47] Prophecy we are standing in a place
[2:03:51] where prophecy is being fulfilled in our
[2:03:53] very
[2:03:57] eyes the world order as it
[2:04:00] is is right here in the
[2:04:03] Bible and the world order as it is going
[2:04:06] to be to
[2:04:08] become is right here in the
[2:04:11] Bible and our
[2:04:13] place as Sons and Daughters of
[2:04:16] God is right here in the scripture
[2:04:20] until you
[2:04:22] understand the Prophecies of the
[2:04:26] world you cannot be able to place
[2:04:28] yourself in the
[2:04:31] scripture and to know where are you
[2:04:34] standing are we just you know worshiping
[2:04:36] a God we do not know and we are going to
[2:04:38] die and go to a place where we don't
[2:04:42] know no listen the Bible speaks about
[2:04:47] dimensions
[2:04:50] you know yesterday one young man was
[2:04:52] asking me seven
[2:04:54] dimensions and those dimensions are
[2:04:59] real when you die today there is a place
[2:05:04] where you are
[2:05:06] going did you know that if you die in
[2:05:11] Christ you are going to a good
[2:05:14] place we call it Heaven oh you want to
[2:05:17] call it Paradise
[2:05:19] whatever you want to call it but that
[2:05:22] place is a
[2:05:25] dimension where your soul
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:29] go people think some people thought that
[2:05:31] oh when someone dies it goes to where
[2:05:32] Jesus
[2:05:34] is no everybody who died in
[2:05:38] Christ has never actually seen
[2:05:41] Jesus never they waiting just like you
[2:05:44] are
[2:05:46] waiting that day is coming
[2:05:49] when we shall see
[2:05:50] Jesus with our very
[2:05:53] eyes in the book of First
[2:05:56] Thessalonians chapter
[2:05:58] 4 since I'm teaching you these things I
[2:06:00] need to read it
[2:06:05] for quickly open there I always refer to
[2:06:09] it but I don't read
[2:06:11] it chapter
[2:06:14] 4 says verse
[2:06:17] 13 I would not not have you to be
[2:06:19] ignorant Brethren concerning them which
[2:06:22] are asleep that ye sorrow not even as
[2:06:25] others which have no hope for if we
[2:06:28] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[2:06:30] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[2:06:33] will God bring with him for this we say
[2:06:35] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[2:06:38] which are alive and remain unto the
[2:06:41] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[2:06:43] them which are asleep for the Lord
[2:06:45] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[2:06:48] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[2:06:50] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[2:06:52] in Christ shall rise
[2:06:53] fast then we which are alive and remain
[2:06:56] shall be CAU up together with them in
[2:06:58] the clouds to meet with the Lord in the
[2:07:01] air and so shall we ever be with the
[2:07:17] Lord
[2:07:43] [Music]
[2:07:47] for
[2:08:10] amen so there are two groups
[2:08:14] here the first
[2:08:16] group are those
[2:08:19] who have have died in
[2:08:24] Christ can you do you have some examples
[2:08:27] of
[2:08:31] those
[2:08:32] Abraham who
[2:08:35] else
[2:08:38] John
[2:08:40] PA
[2:08:42] Peter well Mary those are in the
[2:08:46] Bible do you have examples that you know
[2:08:51] today there are some of those who
[2:08:55] died so you are sure of those in the
[2:08:58] Bible your family members and your
[2:09:03] friends all those that died in
[2:09:07] Christ that believe the word of
[2:09:11] their they are in that place
[2:09:14] together they in one place together they
[2:09:18] w
[2:09:20] to
[2:09:21] resurrect now the Bible says three
[2:09:24] things will
[2:09:25] happen there will be a
[2:09:28] shout a voice and a trumpet now I'll not
[2:09:32] explain it because of
[2:09:34] time but he says that the sounding of
[2:09:37] the
[2:09:38] Trump because it's the last thing to
[2:09:41] sound what is going to happen the dead
[2:09:45] in
[2:09:46] Christ will rise up
[2:09:50] again by the way do you believe
[2:09:53] that this is not a or a
[2:09:57] story listen to me chch this is not a
[2:10:01] bedtime
[2:10:04] story this is a Bible
[2:10:08] prophecy the dead in Christ shall
[2:10:13] rise so what are we waiting for we are
[2:10:16] waiting for them to rise up
[2:10:20] they are going to
[2:10:21] resurrect we are going to see
[2:10:23] them they must right now which forms of
[2:10:26] body are they
[2:10:28] in they are now in another form of
[2:10:32] body in the dimension which they
[2:10:35] in they have to come up
[2:10:38] here and pick
[2:10:41] up another form of
[2:10:44] body here on Earth because you see right
[2:10:47] now right now we are having this form of
[2:10:51] body but this is not the form of body we
[2:10:54] are going to go with
[2:10:56] Resurrection the Bible says even us we
[2:11:00] shall be
[2:11:02] changed our bodies shall be
[2:11:06] Quicken which means this is not the body
[2:11:08] going in the
[2:11:10] rapt they have acted movies on how the
[2:11:12] Rapture is going to
[2:11:15] happen but many of them have it wrong
[2:11:19] you see they think it's just going to be
[2:11:21] a change that is happening one
[2:11:24] day the change is already going on
[2:11:28] now the change is happening right
[2:11:32] now what will when the trumpet of the
[2:11:34] Lord sounds the day Christ shall rise it
[2:11:38] will be the climax of a
[2:11:41] change that has been going on in us for
[2:11:44] ages and
[2:11:47] ages that's why we sing that song I've
[2:11:49] Been Changed I've been reborn all my
[2:11:53] life have been
[2:11:56] rearranged so now those who have been
[2:11:59] changed will meet together with those
[2:12:02] that died in Christ and rose
[2:12:06] again and then they will meet
[2:12:10] together you will see them and they will
[2:12:13] see you you tell God bless you so you
[2:12:17] also made
[2:12:20] Hallelujah you the message
[2:12:22] ofation you you will be able to discuss
[2:12:25] those
[2:12:26] things and then finally the Bible says
[2:12:30] together we shall go and meet the
[2:12:33] Lord that is going to
[2:12:36] happen that is what we
[2:12:39] believe tell your neighbor That's What
[2:12:41] We
[2:12:42] believe We believe that we believe the
[2:12:46] resurrection We Believe
[2:12:49] the change of our
[2:12:51] B that is going to
[2:12:54] happen
[2:12:56] Hallelujah well if you don't believe it
[2:12:58] wait until it
[2:13:01] happens because if you don't believe
[2:13:04] it it will still
[2:13:07] happen and you will be here on Earth and
[2:13:10] you will
[2:13:11] recognize it has already happened and
[2:13:15] you are left
[2:13:16] behind
[2:13:18] but I don't want to be left
[2:13:22] behind what is going to
[2:13:24] happen so
[2:13:26] important that God has said
[2:13:30] behold I will send you Elijah the
[2:13:34] prophet why is God sending Elijah the
[2:13:38] prophet he's sending him so that the
[2:13:41] people can be
[2:13:44] ready for what is going to
[2:13:46] happen
[2:13:50] are you following me
[2:13:51] now all right so I want you to look at
[2:13:54] uh at at that verse
[2:13:58] again in
[2:14:05] vers okay I'll just skip that let's just
[2:14:08] go to verse
[2:14:10] five behold I'll send you Elijah the
[2:14:13] prophet before the coming of the Great
[2:14:15] and the Dreadful day of the
[2:14:16] Lord
[2:14:21] praise the name of the Lord now here
[2:14:24] church is speaking about the two comings
[2:14:27] of Jesus
[2:14:31] Christ he is speaking of his first
[2:14:34] coming and speaking of his second
[2:14:37] coming the first coming of
[2:14:40] Jesus was
[2:14:44] great why because the savior of the
[2:14:47] world came
[2:14:49] he came to die he came to give himself
[2:14:52] he came to bring
[2:14:54] Grace so it was great but was it
[2:14:59] Dreadful I ask you was
[2:15:04] it you can say it was
[2:15:07] Dreadful why it was not
[2:15:10] Dreadful because he did not come to
[2:15:14] bring
[2:15:16] judgment he did not come to bring
[2:15:19] Vengeance came to bring
[2:15:22] Salvation so now you remember I think
[2:15:24] the last service I did some illustration
[2:15:29] here of the first coming of Jesus and
[2:15:31] the second coming of
[2:15:33] Jesus and
[2:15:37] uh maybe I'm trying to see how to avoid
[2:15:40] that but I think I have to do it again
[2:15:44] today so that you can sink in
[2:15:48] I'd like to have four young people if
[2:15:49] you can come up and help me to
[2:15:51] illustrate
[2:15:56] this amen I know you don't want to be
[2:15:58] put on the spot but if you can please
[2:15:59] come and help
[2:16:01] out Isaiah
[2:16:04] 43 as the brothers are coming

[2:24:00] Isaiah we have now seen in
[2:24:02] Isaiah he has
[2:24:04] prophesied and spoken about the first
[2:24:08] coming and the second
[2:24:10] coming where is it Isaiah 61 here he
[2:24:14] says to it is in one verse
[2:24:17] to
[2:24:18] proclaim the acceptable year of the
[2:24:22] Lord and the day of
[2:24:27] v and to comfort all

[2:24:58] one when he
[2:25:00] came isn't he the one he speaking over
[2:25:03] here the
[2:25:05] prophecy but when he
[2:25:07] came he read this verse from verse
[2:25:12] one he reached verse
[2:25:15] two he didn't
[2:25:19] vers he read it up to the part which
[2:25:21] says the
[2:25:26] AC and he left the other
[2:25:29] part he closed the book and he said to
[2:25:32] the people this day this scripture is
[2:25:37] fulfilled why
[2:25:40] because that first
[2:25:43] part of declaring the
[2:25:45] acceptable was fulfilled in his first
[2:25:49] coming the other part was not
[2:25:55] yet

[2:26:02] Chapter Brothers you're going to wait
[2:26:04] until I ustr the part of Elijah if you
[2:26:06] don't
[2:26:08] mind praise God are you there
[2:26:15] Luke
[2:26:17] I want you to see when Jesus I think
[2:26:18] chapter 4 when Jesus Takes this
[2:26:21] book in chapter 4
[2:26:24] ver
[2:26:28] 17 and there was delivered unto him a
[2:26:32] book of the Prophet
[2:26:34] Isiah and when he had opened the
[2:26:37] book he found the
[2:26:40] place he knew what he was trying
[2:26:45] to
[2:26:47] I understand this prophecy he found the
[2:26:52] book the
[2:26:54] place which was
[2:26:57] written the spirit of the
[2:26:59] Lord is upon
[2:27:03] mey this time he was not
[2:27:06] prophesying this time he was reading it
[2:27:11] personally he was declaring to
[2:27:14] them that the spirit of the Lord is upon
[2:27:18] me it was now him he was speaking of
[2:27:23] himself Isaiah
[2:27:25] prophesy Jesus was reading
[2:27:29] that deing it
[2:27:32] himself that the spirit of the Lord is
[2:27:34] upon
[2:27:35] me because he has anointed me to preach
[2:27:38] the gospel to the poor he sent me to
[2:27:41] heal the broken
[2:27:43] heart Deliverance to the cap
[2:27:47] and recovering of the sight to the
[2:27:49] blind to set Li them that are
[2:27:53] bre verse
[2:27:55] 19 now brother Fred
[2:27:59] verse of Isaiah
[2:28:12] 61 now follow me closely here if you if
[2:28:17] you can't explain this after I've
[2:28:18] explained it to you you've not
[2:28:22] understood you have to be able to
[2:28:24] explain
[2:28:25] it to
[2:28:27] somebody so follow
[2:28:29] me now to preach the acceptable year of
[2:28:36] the when Jesus read this
[2:28:40] place he put a full
[2:28:43] stop he put a full stop there's a full
[2:28:45] stop right there
[2:28:48] but where he was
[2:28:49] reading in Isaiah 61 verse 2 there was
[2:28:56] a but Jesus put a full
[2:29:00] St because this was now his first
[2:29:06] coming the other details were not
[2:29:09] necessary at this
[2:29:11] time he was talking about his second
[2:29:15] com
[2:29:22] Hallelujah when you come here yes yes
[2:29:24] you did so well see in
[2:29:27] Isaiah oh brother Isaac if you can flush
[2:29:30] it on the screen there both those
[2:29:32] scriptures Isaiah and and and and and
[2:29:34] and
[2:29:35] Luke you see in Isaiah he says to
[2:29:39] proclaim the
[2:29:44] acceptable are you seeing it in your
[2:29:46] Bible
[2:29:52] the AC the
[2:29:55] Lord the day of venance of our
[2:29:59] God the Messiah is the
[2:30:01] same but his coming is
[2:30:05] different are you following me these are
[2:30:08] just
[2:30:09] illustrating the Messiah who came the
[2:30:12] first
[2:30:13] time is the one who came the second time
[2:30:17] you understand but these on are just
[2:30:19] representing the first and the
[2:30:22] second so now yes yes you the first
[2:30:25] Messiah you can stand there so now when
[2:30:28] he came the first time he was coming to
[2:30:31] to proclaim the acceptable year
[2:30:36] the and he would come again the second
[2:30:40] time to do what to
[2:30:42] proclaim the day of
[2:30:45] vengeance Our
[2:30:47] God by this
[2:30:50] time these words the day of
[2:30:54] Vengeance was not necessary for Jesus to
[2:30:58] speak so when you go to Luke he skipped
[2:31:03] it in of
[2:31:07] a and the Bible says and he close the
[2:31:12] book everybody say close the book he
[2:31:16] closed the book and he gave it unto the
[2:31:21] minister and he sat
[2:31:23] down and all the eyes of them were in
[2:31:26] the synagogue were
[2:31:29] F they looked at him are you trying to
[2:31:35] in and he began to say unto
[2:31:38] them this

[2:32:09] reading is fulfill
[2:32:12] today this day my first coming but there
[2:32:16] is another day another day coming and
[2:32:21] that other words of the day of
[2:32:24] V shall be fulfilled but for now in this
[2:32:29] day this scripture is fulfill in your
[2:32:34] ears they wanted to Stone
[2:32:37] him how can you the
[2:32:41] Messiah oh my goodness I don't know
[2:32:44] whether you get it do you know why they
[2:32:47] wanted to kill
[2:32:49] him
[2:32:52] because they missed
[2:32:58] El they were
[2:33:00] supposed to receive an's
[2:33:05] Min which would prepare them to
[2:33:10] receive but when mesiah came they
[2:33:14] recognized him not they missed the
[2:33:16] ministry which PR them
[2:33:20] understand when this ministry
[2:33:23] came they actually did not recognize it
[2:33:27] also if you miss Elijah of your
[2:33:31] day you will miss the
[2:33:35] Messiah Elijah's Ministry is very
[2:33:39] important because It prepares you for
[2:33:42] the
[2:33:44] Messiah praise praise
[2:33:47] God okay give me now
[2:33:49] Malachi now it says behold I will send

[2:35:11] Jesus turn the hearts of the children to
[2:35:14] the
[2:35:15] fathers
[2:35:20] it is the same
[2:35:21] verse but it speaks to different
[2:35:25] things so when you read the Bible as if
[2:35:27] they newspaper you will miss it you will
[2:35:30] miss that and you don't understand but
[2:35:34] it is in the Bible
[2:35:36] there notice

[2:35:43] of speaks about two comings of
[2:35:50] speaks about two different works that
[2:35:52] this Elijah will

[2:36:11] look how can we
[2:36:13] know that this
[2:36:17] Elijah only did the first
[2:36:20] portion of turning the hearts of the
[2:36:25] father our Bible will tell us everything
[2:36:29] must be in the
[2:36:30] Bible open your
[2:36:33] Bible praise God
[2:36:37] Matthew in the Book of
[2:36:39] Matthew I believe it
[2:36:44] is
[2:36:46] are you all
[2:36:52] there praise
[2:36:55] God speaks about the birth of
[2:37:01] John okay I think I I was looking for
[2:37:04] Luke chapter one me
[2:37:09] pleas Luke chapter
[2:37:11] 1 brother Marin give it to me verse 13
[2:37:17] but the angel said unto
[2:37:20] him fear not zachari for th prayer is
[2:37:24] hard and wife Elizabeth shall bear their
[2:37:28] son shall call him his name
[2:37:32] John now this is John going to be
[2:37:37] born okay everybody say Amen if
[2:37:41] you is going to be born
[2:37:43] now okay and then he
[2:37:46] says for he shall be great in the sight
[2:37:49] of the
[2:37:51] Lord and shall drink neither wine nor
[2:37:53] drink no strong
[2:37:56] drink John I hope you don't drink those
[2:38:00] things a very good
[2:38:02] type and he shall be filled with the
[2:38:05] Holy
[2:38:07] Ghost even from his
[2:38:14] mother's
[2:38:16] When God Says
[2:38:19] something has to come
[2:38:22] to his word never
[2:38:26] fails that's the reason why I've served
[2:38:28] Jesus all the 70
[2:38:31] years because I trust him every day more
[2:38:34] and
[2:38:36] more he can never
[2:38:40] fail he said something that has never
[2:38:44] happened
[2:38:47] that this John would receive the Holy
[2:38:51] Ghost in his
[2:38:53] mother's have you ever seen it
[2:38:57] happen but when God spoke it by an
[2:39:02] Angel it was potentially
[2:39:07] fulfilled and when
[2:39:10] Mary met
[2:39:12] Elizabeth hallelujah oh sister Eliz God
[2:39:16] bless you when Mary met
[2:39:19] Elizabeth Elizabeth had a baby in her
[2:39:24] sto baby
[2:39:27] John and baby John was almost
[2:39:32] dead he had never
[2:39:35] responded but
[2:39:37] when Mary came to
[2:39:40] Elizabeth you know they were
[2:39:43] cousins so when they met
[2:39:46] Mary had
[2:39:48] Jesus in the stomach let me tell you
[2:39:52] there is nobody else who gives the Holy
[2:39:54] Ghost but
[2:39:59] Jesus Hallelujah he started giving the
[2:40:02] Holy Ghost when he was in the
[2:40:07] womb when Mary's
[2:40:09] bu met with
[2:40:13] Elizabeth when they huged
[2:40:17] Jesus touched
[2:40:20] John and joh
[2:40:24] began why he was filled with the power
[2:40:28] of the Holy
[2:40:29] Ghost right in the stomach
[2:40:32] of to fulfill the
[2:40:35] prophecy which say he shall receive the
[2:40:39] Holy Ghost in his mother's
[2:40:44] womb
[2:40:46] hallelujah hallelujah the word of God
[2:40:49] never
[2:40:52] fails and then many of the and then he
[2:40:56] continues on and because of
[2:40:59] John many of the children of
[2:41:03] Israel shall be turned to the Lord their
[2:41:10] God and
[2:41:12] John shall go before Jesus
[2:41:19] John shall come before
[2:41:22] Jesus in the
[2:41:24] power and in the spirit
[2:41:31] of in your
[2:41:34] Bible in the spirit and power of
[2:41:38] el Hallelujah this man here
[2:41:42] John was not coming as John
[2:41:46] he was not coming as a son of
[2:41:48] Zarah he was
[2:41:50] coming according to what the Bible
[2:41:54] say power and in the spirit of
[2:42:01] Elijah to do
[2:42:04] what do you all remember Malachi
[2:42:10] 4:6 let us remind
[2:42:13] ourselves Mal chter 4 verse 5
[2:42:18] 6 and he shall
[2:42:21] turn the hearts of the
[2:42:25] fathers to the
[2:42:27] children everybody
[2:42:34] and and the Heart of the children to
[2:42:36] their fathers now let us go to
[2:42:40] Luke what will John
[2:42:43] do the scripture say
[2:42:46] when Jo's Ministry
[2:42:49] comes he shall go in the power and in
[2:42:52] the spirit of
[2:42:54] Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers
[2:42:57] to the

[2:43:29] disobedient the wisdom of the just to
[2:43:31] make ready a people prepared for the
[2:43:34] Lord let me ask you a question where did
[2:43:38] turning the hearts of the children to
[2:43:39] the fathers
[2:43:44] go
[2:43:49] are you following
[2:43:50] me are you
[2:43:52] confused are you confused
[2:43:55] church are you following
[2:43:58] me did you understand that so what what
[2:44:02] is he talking
[2:44:04] about he's talking about John's
[2:44:07] Ministry being in the power and the
[2:44:09] spirit
[2:44:10] of to turn the hearts of the
[2:44:14] fathers but he did not mention children
[2:44:16] to
[2:44:19] fathers that was not for
[2:44:23] John that was for this
[2:44:26] El are you
[2:44:28] following now who are the fathers to the
[2:44:33] children these are the sades and
[2:44:38] phes fathers of the
[2:44:40] law their hearts are going to be turned
[2:44:44] by
[2:44:46] when he was preaching to them
[2:44:48] repent repent it was being turned from
[2:44:52] the Lord
[2:44:56] to from the Lord to
[2:44:58] Grace from Moses to
[2:45:01] Jesus John's Ministry was
[2:45:04] fulfilled by simply preaching
[2:45:09] repent and when his ministry was
[2:45:12] finished John was K
[2:45:19] they cut off his
[2:45:21] head and they put it on
[2:45:29] a because his ministry was
[2:45:36] finished so Pastor why did they cut
[2:45:40] his I ask you a question why didn't they
[2:45:44] cut off his head before he finished his
[2:45:48] work it doesn't matter how you
[2:45:51] die but when you
[2:45:53] die it means god is finished with
[2:45:57] you and you cannot die until God is
[2:46:03] finished are you hearing me that's why
[2:46:06] me I don't fear
[2:46:08] death when it comes it
[2:46:10] comes but as far as I know when I is not
[2:46:14] done with me

[2:46:17] nowhere whether someone sends you
[2:46:20] witchcraft whether someone hates you

[2:46:40] going nowhere same for you brother
[2:46:43] sister you are going nowhere

[2:46:50] long as Jesus is not done with
[2:46:52] me I have more work for
[2:46:55] him and John stayed for as long as Jesus
[2:46:59] wanted him to accomplish his
[2:47:03] work and when Jesus was done with
[2:47:09] him was Jesus done with
[2:47:12] him the day
[2:47:15] John introduced Jesus to the
[2:47:20] world he says
[2:47:23] Behold the Lamb of
[2:47:26] God Tak the of
[2:47:30] the his
[2:47:38] true but the people are
[2:47:41] still what is he talking about they
[2:47:45] understand they they missed
[2:47:48] John they were waiting for a man called
[2:47:52] Elijah elah came but for them what did
[2:47:55] they see they saw a man who is having
[2:47:59] rugs a man who is not
[2:48:02] educated a man who is who doesn't know
[2:48:05] how to speak very well who was eating
[2:48:08] wild
[2:48:09] H and lo they said you are crazy
[2:48:13] man
[2:48:15] you see all the the dreadlocks and
[2:48:17] everything you have a problem John John
[2:48:20] please excuse
[2:48:22] us they came to him and asked him who he
[2:48:26] was who who he was let me show you
[2:48:29] something here let me show you something
[2:48:32] talking about
[2:48:35] John Isaiah
[2:48:38] 43
[2:48:39] prophesied the voice of him that cth in
[2:48:42] the
[2:48:43] wilderness
[2:48:45] prepare ye the way of the
[2:48:47] Lord make straight in the desert a
[2:48:50] Highway To Our
[2:48:52] God if you heard it say
[2:48:56] Amen that is the prophecy of
[2:49:00] John Malachi
[2:49:02] 31 behold I will send my
[2:49:06] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[2:49:08] before
[2:49:09] me and the Lord whom you
[2:49:12] seek shall suddenly come to his
[2:49:14] [Music]
[2:49:16] Temple is that
[2:49:18] amen they didn't understand but those
[2:49:22] prophetes both were speaking about
[2:49:26] joh where is my John can you come back
[2:49:30] here people stood before
[2:49:35] John I have a scripture here the says
[2:49:38] and this is the record of
[2:49:40] John John 1
[2:49:43] ver when the Jews sent
[2:49:47] priests from Jerusalem to ask him who
[2:49:51] are
[2:49:54] you the people didn't understand
[2:49:57] who so they came to
[2:49:59] ask who are
[2:50:01] you and he confessed and denied not but
[2:50:07] confessed I am not the
[2:50:11] Christ remember we are learning now
[2:50:14] listen
[2:50:15] carefully he
[2:50:17] confessed that he was
[2:50:19] Christ sorry that he was not the Christ
[2:50:23] but he denied
[2:50:24] not that he was
[2:50:31] Christ Christ means the anointed
[2:50:38] one so he denied to be the
[2:50:43] Christ
[2:50:46] but he accepted that he was
[2:50:50] anointed with a spirit
[2:50:53] of listen Church the spirit of
[2:50:56] Elijah was not a man Elijah incarnating
[2:51:00] in another
[2:51:04] man it is the spirit of Jesus
[2:51:08] Christ or rather call it the spirit of
[2:51:10] God that worked upon Elijah
[2:51:16] that God used on other
[2:51:20] men so you see John was anointed with
[2:51:22] the spirit of
[2:51:24] Christ but he was not the
[2:51:29] Christ this one was the
[2:51:31] Christ but this one was
[2:51:34] John
[2:51:36] elah so when they asked him he said no
[2:51:39] I'm not I'm
[2:51:41] anointed but I'm not the Christ
[2:51:46] and they asked him what then are you
[2:51:50] Elijah and he said I am
[2:51:55] not hallelujah hallelujah now to people
[2:51:59] who did not believe that John Was
[2:52:03] Elijah John himself spoke in his own
[2:52:06] mouth and he said I'm not
[2:52:11] elij so how do you do with that
[2:52:15] now before I
[2:52:17] continue before I
[2:52:19] continue let me read for you Matthew
[2:52:23] 11:13 in the words of
[2:52:26] Jesus all the prophets and the law
[2:52:29] prophesied until
[2:52:33] John and if ye will receive
[2:52:36] it this is
[2:52:39] El which was for to
[2:52:43] come
[2:52:45] he
[2:52:57] has don't worry let me give you some
[2:52:59] ration now here Elijah who was John they
[2:53:04] asked are you Elijah he said
[2:53:08] no why did he said
[2:53:13] no because
[2:53:15] because these
[2:53:18] people when they saw John and they were
[2:53:21] calling him Elijah they thought he was
[2:53:23] this
[2:53:26] Elijah so he said I'm not that
[2:53:30] one even when they saw the
[2:53:33] Messiah they thought he was this
[2:53:37] Messiah he said no I'm not
[2:53:41] that you you understand people always
[2:53:44] want to push things
[2:53:46] ahead or behind they don't want to
[2:53:49] believe what is
[2:53:50] happening they were accepting
[2:53:52] Jesus as long as he is the Messiah who
[2:53:55] is coming to rule the
[2:53:57] world to sit on the throne of
[2:54:00] David but he said no I'm not my kingdom
[2:54:03] is not of the this
[2:54:05] world that's why the Jews never accepted
[2:54:08] the
[2:54:09] Messiah they were confused the Messiah
[2:54:13] is supposed to sit in the
[2:54:16] why is he not
[2:54:19] accepting I believe I believe even Judas
[2:54:22] is he must have believe that
[2:54:25] idea that's why he betrayed him because
[2:54:29] he knew he must sit on the throne
[2:54:33] and he was waiting for Jesus to
[2:54:36] reain to rule over the world so he
[2:54:40] didn't expect him to
[2:54:41] die you have to understand when Jesus J
[2:54:45] died people lost
[2:54:47] hope but the problem was one they
[2:54:51] misallocated Bible
[2:54:56] prophecy so if you miss it
[2:54:59] today missing the
[2:55:03] Messiah are you Elijah he said no I am
[2:55:07] not that
[2:55:08] Elijah but Jesus
[2:55:13] said
[2:55:14] are you that
[2:55:16] prophet he said no do you know what that
[2:55:20] scripture means says are you that
[2:55:24] Prophet how many Bible readers do we
[2:55:28] have very few okay how many Christians
[2:55:31] do we
[2:55:34] have I'm trying to challenge you I
[2:55:37] know you have to read the Bible
[2:55:39] Christians read the
[2:55:42] Bible in theonomy
[2:55:45] there was a
[2:55:46] prophecy that the Lord God shall raise
[2:55:48] up a
[2:55:50] prophet like unto
[2:55:53] me Moses spoke
[2:55:56] that a
[2:55:58] prophet like unto me that was not
[2:56:03] John that was speaking of the
[2:56:07] Messiah are you following me so here
[2:56:10] when they were asking are you that
[2:56:13] prophet were promised that he will
[2:56:16] come like unto
[2:56:18] Moses he said no I'm
[2:56:21] not John knew his place in the
[2:56:27] script are you following me are you
[2:56:30] following me so now they asked him a
[2:56:33] question so tell
[2:56:35] us who are
[2:56:40] you that we may give an answer to them
[2:56:42] that sent us
[2:56:44] what say thou of
[2:56:47] th and
[2:56:50] he he
[2:56:52] said I am the voice of one crying in the
[2:56:58] wild make straight the way of
[2:57:02] the the
[2:57:06] prophet
[2:57:08] saidh that's what John
[2:57:11] answered I am the voice of one crying in
[2:57:14] the
[2:57:16] wildness straight the way of the
[2:57:19] lord The Way of the
[2:57:24] Lord you know that prophecy was speaking
[2:57:27] about the coming
[2:57:30] Prophet
[2:57:33] Mah and
[2:57:35] Jesus when he came these people did not
[2:57:40] because they miss
[2:57:43] John they miss the
[2:57:45] Messiah so they killed him and when they
[2:57:48] killed him and he left the sin I'm sure
[2:57:52] I not to call you
[2:57:53] back so when he left the
[2:57:56] scene after he had announced the
[2:58:00] people who he
[2:58:04] was the people still didn't understand
[2:58:07] him you know you remember we asked him
[2:58:10] whether he's
[2:58:11] Elijah he said he's not
[2:58:15] and again we ask him whether is that
[2:58:17] prophet and he said is not and when we
[2:58:21] asked him who he is he said I am the
[2:58:25] voice from the
[2:58:29] Wilderness do you know that that
[2:58:32] prophecy is actually speaking about of
[2:58:35] el yes so why did
[2:58:39] he let us leave this John
[2:58:42] guy but by doing that they did not solve
[2:58:46] the puzzle of the
[2:58:49] prophecy they missed the
[2:58:52] Messiah so they asked him who are
[2:58:55] you and he said before
[2:58:59] Abraham was I
[2:59:01] am Abraham just to see my he saw it and
[2:59:04] he
[2:59:05] was who are you I'm the resurrection and
[2:59:08] the
[2:59:12] life this is
[2:59:15] confusing who are
[2:59:17] you if you don't believe I am
[2:59:20] here you will die in
[2:59:24] your how can he speak like
[2:59:29] that because they
[2:59:32] missed and when the Messiah
[2:59:36] came he told them if you will receive
[2:59:40] it John Was Elijah which was to come
[2:59:46] but still they didn't
[2:59:48] understand
[2:59:53] knowled one day they come to him
[2:59:57] again they come to the Messiah
[3:00:00] again brother give us that
[3:00:02] scripture I'm approaching the finishing
[3:00:04] of
[3:00:06] this listen they come with a scripture
[3:00:11] again in the Book of Matthew
[3:00:15] vers 17 vers
[3:00:18] 10 my
[3:00:20] my are you
[3:00:23] there marthew 1 ver
[3:00:26] 10 praise
[3:00:29] God and his disciples asked him
[3:00:35] saying now his disciples
[3:00:38] again they asking the
[3:00:41] Messiah why did describe
[3:00:46] say that Elijah must first
[3:00:50] come let me ask my students this
[3:00:53] morning where did the scribes say
[3:00:57] that in which
[3:00:59] prophecy does anyone who has been
[3:01:01] following
[3:01:05] know Malachi
[3:01:12] chapter five
[3:01:15] good
[3:01:16] students now the scribes
[3:01:21] said before the great
[3:01:25] and now this is Jesus now the great day
[3:01:28] of the Lord they missed
[3:01:30] John now they asking Jesus we are
[3:01:34] confused we can't place
[3:01:37] scriptures why did the scribes
[3:01:41] say must
[3:01:46] why why did they ask that
[3:01:49] question follow me closely please follow
[3:01:53] me why did they ask Jesus that
[3:01:56] question if you read from verse
[3:02:00] one this is the Mount of
[3:02:04] transfiguration you remember that when
[3:02:07] Moses and Elijah
[3:02:11] appeared and Jesus was changed
[3:02:15] and he was in aoud together with MES
[3:02:19] and they received the
[3:02:21] Revelation did did Moses
[3:02:25] die did Moses
[3:02:28] die
[3:02:30] yes did Elijah
[3:02:33] die so Elijah was a
[3:02:37] type of the those who did not
[3:02:42] die
[3:02:44] who are still alive Moses was a type of
[3:02:49] those who are dead in
[3:02:52] Christ Jesus was the
[3:02:56] Messiah you remember the scripture in
[3:02:58] first
[3:03:02] thalon which we read
[3:03:04] here you remember
[3:03:06] it the dead in
[3:03:08] Christ shall rise
[3:03:11] F Moses then we which and Al remain
[3:03:16] shall be changed El and then we shall
[3:03:20] meet the
[3:03:21] Lord in the air they saw
[3:03:26] Jesus and then they say so you are the
[3:03:29] Messiah you are the Messiah so you have
[3:03:32] been the
[3:03:34] Messiah now solve this for us if you are
[3:03:38] the
[3:03:39] Messiah if you are the Lord so tell us
[3:03:43] why have you come
[3:03:49] before why did the scribes
[3:03:53] say must first
[3:03:55] come we have not seen El and if you the
[3:03:59] mesiah how come
[3:04:02] El did not
[3:04:05] come they even said the scribes they
[3:04:08] they doubted whether that was a
[3:04:12] prophecy
[3:04:14] they thought someone just
[3:04:17] WR but Jesus answered
[3:04:20] them oh I love Bible
[3:04:22] prophecy and I love Jesus he is God he's
[3:04:27] not just a man he's more than a
[3:04:31] man he gave his word and he knows how to
[3:04:36] interpret
[3:04:38] it Hallelujah so Jesus answered them
[3:04:42] Jesus answered them here praise God are
[3:04:46] you following
[3:04:48] me okay let me find my scripture
[3:04:51] here so Jesus answered and said unto
[3:04:55] them El
[3:04:59] truly mesiah please come come
[3:05:02] closer look the other
[3:05:04] side when they ask him why did they say
[3:05:08] that elas must first
[3:05:10] come we have not seen
[3:05:12] El
[3:05:14] so Jesus answered them yeah yeah yeah
[3:05:18] true Elias elah
[3:05:25] truly is
[3:05:31] pointing
[3:05:33] not
[3:05:35] but first
[3:05:41] come now have you got the
[3:05:45] understanding have you got the
[3:05:47] Revelation now the wisdom of the spirit
[3:05:50] have you got the
[3:05:53] understanding it enter
[3:05:55] bro he talked about the Elijah who
[3:06:01] is shall first
[3:06:04] come and he introduces another
[3:06:09] word and restore all
[3:06:12] things
[3:06:14] let me ask you a question did John
[3:06:16] restore
[3:06:19] anything if you have been following me
[3:06:22] what did he
[3:06:24] do he pre
[3:06:28] he
[3:06:32] he he prepared for something
[3:06:36] new the Messiah was coming he prepared
[3:06:39] for the Messiah and when the Messiah
[3:06:42] came when his ministry was
[3:06:45] finished but now here oh hallelujah
[3:06:49] hallelujah the mesiah is say El shall
[3:06:56] trly and restore all
[3:06:58] things that is another
[3:07:01] Ministry that is another man coming in
[3:07:05] the end
[3:07:06] time not John the
[3:07:08] Baptist Jesus was simply telling
[3:07:11] them yes
[3:07:13] before I come the second
[3:07:16] time Elijah will first come and restore
[3:07:20] all
[3:07:22] things hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus
[3:07:26] also
[3:07:27] knew elah had
[3:07:29] already and people had missed
[3:07:32] him so he
[3:07:35] continued but in in
[3:07:38] Ethiopia we say again again but
[3:07:48] I sayto
[3:07:50] you El is come
[3:07:56] already
[3:08:06] Hallelujah but I say unto you that
[3:08:10] Elias is come already
[3:08:19] already so he says is come already and
[3:08:22] they knew
[3:08:28] him and you did unto him whatever
[3:08:31] you like shall also the son of
[3:08:35] man even me I'm going to
[3:08:37] suffer like that because you don't
[3:08:39] understand
[3:08:41] me when he say that
[3:08:43] he
[3:08:45] said he's talking
[3:08:51] about after John has
[3:08:55] already but that one was already
[3:08:59] fulfilled already
[3:09:03] already and Jesus was telling
[3:09:05] them he already
[3:09:07] came but that when they missed it just
[3:09:10] like when he told them he will come they
[3:09:12] also missed
[3:09:16] now we are here Mah already came
[3:09:23] and we are
[3:09:25] here the question is are we going to
[3:09:30] miss proph the way they
[3:09:36] did this is a Bible
[3:09:39] prophecy it must
[3:09:41] happen
[3:09:43] Elijah must
[3:09:45] come and rest
[3:09:49] all when this elah
[3:09:52] comes he will rest
[3:09:54] all and Mah will
[3:09:58] come where are we we are right
[3:10:02] here we are right
[3:10:04] here don't miss
[3:10:08] it Elijah must
[3:10:11] come with anti
[3:10:15] Ministry to restore all
[3:10:19] things there will be many
[3:10:22] prophets many preachers many churches
[3:10:26] in but when Elijah come he's coming with
[3:10:30] a special
[3:10:32] Ministry his ministry is going to be
[3:10:35] different he will talk against women
[3:10:38] preachers because the Bible says so he
[3:10:41] will he will talk against infant
[3:10:44] baptism because the Bible says he will
[3:10:48] preach one go and he will preach against
[3:10:50] the
[3:10:52] Trinity because the Bible says he will
[3:10:56] teach every
[3:10:58] teacher the apostles
[3:11:00] told because his work is to restore
[3:11:05] all all teachings of the Apostles all
[3:11:09] Bible teachings all foundational
[3:11:12] teachings of chran
[3:11:15] he will
[3:11:16] restore Elijah must
[3:11:19] come this
[3:11:21] time if he doesn't come Jezebel will
[3:11:25] finish his
[3:11:27] life spiritual
[3:11:29] isra if he doesn't come jeel will finish
[3:11:35] you the Bible speaks and prophesies of a
[3:11:38] spiritual
[3:11:41] jeel read your
[3:11:43] Bible he says a
[3:11:46] woman I wish I had time I go
[3:11:49] there a woman seated
[3:11:55] upon with names of
[3:11:58] blasphemy what is she she a church
[3:12:03] system covering the whole
[3:12:06] earth and the B says she makes the kings
[3:12:10] of the
[3:12:11] Earth
[3:12:13] to commit spiritual
[3:12:16] fornication and all the
[3:12:18] multitudes and all the people because
[3:12:21] that is the
[3:12:23] water she was Seated on it's
[3:12:27] symbolic in the Book of
[3:12:29] Revelation so the Bible speaks about
[3:12:32] Jezebel in the end
[3:12:35] time Jezebel is here
[3:12:37] again is here again telling children to
[3:12:41] be baptized
[3:12:44] baptizing babies who are simply
[3:12:47] crying Bing
[3:12:49] them in the name of the father and of
[3:12:52] the
[3:12:54] son where is that in the
[3:12:56] Bible
[3:12:58] Doctrine Jezebel Doctrine she teaching
[3:13:03] people in the same time it's okay you
[3:13:07] can
[3:13:11] be get no
[3:13:14] problem Grace is
[3:13:16] there teaching of
[3:13:20] Jezebel letting men and women be
[3:13:24] moral leaving the standards of the
[3:13:28] World and St being so
[3:13:31] low teachings of
[3:13:34] B they think they standing for
[3:13:39] God
[3:13:41] jeel made all the peoples of the
[3:13:45] world to fornicate
[3:13:48] spiritually with her spiritual
[3:13:52] immorality and that's why this is the
[3:13:56] time that God promised to send Elijah
[3:14:01] again when Elijah comes he comes with a
[3:14:04] ministry of food
[3:14:07] restoration of the whole word of
[3:14:11] God the way it is in the
[3:14:13] scriptures there will be men and women
[3:14:17] who will hear the message of
[3:14:19] Elijah and there will be different from
[3:14:21] all the
[3:14:23] world and they'll be prepared for the
[3:14:26] Rapture I am one of
[3:14:28] them I'm one of them Elijah has come
[3:14:33] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah last
[3:14:37] night I listened to somebody called
[3:14:39] Robert lson
[3:14:41] or and and he was speaking on William
[3:14:43] Bram Bram and he said William
[3:14:48] Bram was the greatest
[3:14:51] Prophet the reals of
[3:14:55] Prophecy since the days of
[3:15:01] Jesus and this man
[3:15:04] said William
[3:15:06] Bram you could not compare him with
[3:15:09] anybody but then he says but he died a
[3:15:13] tragic
[3:15:14] death and it says
[3:15:17] because he he
[3:15:20] Backle and went into
[3:15:22] teaching and yet his ministry was in the
[3:15:26] prophetic when I listen to that I was
[3:15:29] going to switch it off I said let me
[3:15:31] finish it and then when I finished it I
[3:15:34] just simply noticed these men are not
[3:15:37] given to
[3:15:39] know the Bible says huah there are some
[3:15:43] who are given to know the mysteries of
[3:15:46] the kingdom of
[3:15:47] heaven but some are not given
[3:15:50] to I believe I'm one of those who are
[3:15:54] given William Bram William Bram was a
[3:15:58] prophet everybody in the religious World
[3:16:03] believes they believe he was just a
[3:16:07] prophet to
[3:16:09] prophesy to heal and to raise the
[3:16:13] they actually believe in his
[3:16:15] ministry to that
[3:16:17] extent but when it comes to the teaching
[3:16:20] of the
[3:16:21] word they said it is not his
[3:16:24] place they even understand the
[3:16:28] Bible in the Bible the ministry of a
[3:16:32] prophet is the one that receives the
[3:16:35] revelation of the
[3:16:38] word all the other
[3:16:41] prophets
[3:16:43] spiritually worldly
[3:16:51] bar but when Elijah came what did he do
[3:16:55] he stoop down took the
[3:16:58] stones them
[3:17:00] together the
[3:17:02] does teaching the
[3:17:05] right placing back the
[3:17:09] landmarks and after that
[3:17:12] he now called upon
[3:17:14] God the miracle of
[3:17:17] fire comes to vindicate the word which
[3:17:21] is
[3:17:25] being brother Bram on the day of his
[3:17:31] accident do you know what
[3:17:35] happened there's a drunk driver who
[3:17:39] came and he's he was driving on the
[3:17:42] opposite side of the
[3:17:44] Lan which brother bam was
[3:17:48] driving and brother Billy Paul was in
[3:17:51] the other
[3:17:53] car which was
[3:17:54] ahead so they saw the drunk driver
[3:17:58] coming brother was in the car with his
[3:18:01] wife and so B Paul dodged the
[3:18:07] driver and then the driver just came
[3:18:10] brother B had not seen him so he hit
[3:18:16] and so they
[3:18:17] crashed and when they crashed they went
[3:18:20] through the
[3:18:23] windshield again so they were in that
[3:18:26] ruin the sister died
[3:18:28] immediately the wife of brother
[3:18:31] bam and and and and and brother bham was
[3:18:34] still
[3:18:35] alive many bones were broken
[3:18:39] over and uh then you know bil ran
[3:18:44] back and found him there and then she
[3:18:48] said he
[3:18:49] said is Mommy
[3:18:51] alive said no they touched his she was
[3:18:55] gone said place my hands on
[3:19:00] her so laid his hand on her said Lord
[3:19:05] help
[3:19:05] us in our time of
[3:19:08] trouble let Mommy not
[3:19:10] die and just a few words he
[3:19:14] mattered and in a moment she came back
[3:19:17] to and in all his ministry he rose up
[3:19:21] five people from the dead she was
[3:19:25] the and yet he died from the same
[3:19:33] accident John the
[3:19:35] Baptist died a tragic
[3:19:38] death but he was
[3:19:41] Elijah
[3:19:44] Elijah who received the spirit of Elijah
[3:19:47] the first time he died theyed him but
[3:19:52] his death also had
[3:19:56] questions did you know that in his death
[3:19:58] he
[3:20:02] rose they threw a dead
[3:20:06] body on
[3:20:09] him and because it touched him
[3:20:14] the person came
[3:20:16] back I'm talking about
[3:20:19] elah Elijah nobody knows where he is
[3:20:23] because he never died it's
[3:20:26] question the ministry of
[3:20:29] Elijah is entirely
[3:20:32] questionable confuses the
[3:20:35] confus but to those it is
[3:20:38] sent no
[3:20:40] question because it's not about the
[3:20:43] man it's about the
[3:20:46] ministry it's about the word which they
[3:20:49] brought for and I want to tell you in
[3:20:52] our
[3:20:53] generation Elijah has
[3:20:57] come by the way Billy Paul has lived
[3:21:00] ever
[3:21:01] since he just died I think this past
[3:21:03] week
[3:21:06] or 88 years but I want to say this they
[3:21:10] have been living
[3:21:13] people who have seen the
[3:21:18] Min Jesus would prophesy and
[3:21:21] say Tru shall first come and restore all
[3:21:25] things and I want to tell you that Jesus
[3:21:29] spoke has already come and has restored
[3:21:32] all things we now know B in the name of
[3:21:36] Jesus CHR we now know the teachings of
[3:21:39] the
