But you told us that when the spirit that raised Christ from the dead, when he dwelleth in us, he will quicken our motor. It's only can make this service a service. One time you came in the den of lion and you shut the lion's mouth.

Vers 10. [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise be to God. I greet you again once again this morning. Yeah. Uh our pastor is not with us. Yeah. But you keep him in prayer. We last communicated yesterday in fact through the text and this morning I've not heard from him but we know all is well. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh this morning I want us to I'm going to take my I'm going to call my text we are not alone. Praise be to God. And I always say that uh the hardest moment for me is standing in front of all ministers know that So just pray for me that the Lord will speak to you. I have nothing of my own. I don't have my own message but we have one message and that is the message of the hour. Amen. Amen. Uh yesterday was somewhere far I was doing some work and uh the devil tried to disorganize me. I request the people those are working the sound to increase my sound. After I was done with the work and when I was coming I realized my iPad was missing and yet I was very far. So I thought of going back and coming. I needed to use it this morning. I was not sure where it was because I had it when I was leaving work and I happened to use like two borders. So I was not sure but at least the one uh the one the second one when I was coming my mind told that something was missing checked my phone I had other tools I use for I had them then after I had traveled some good kilometers maybe like 20 I realized it was not Praise be to God. But my heart was firm because my iPad has a lot of things. Has my quotation, my work and other things like that. My sermons and getting a single sermon is not easy. So I was telling God, what am I going through? But I just believed God said let me go back. I went to the mobile money point where I where where I carried some transaction and the told me I not the thing was not there. So what I went to the I went to police and I reported uh the I reported the case of losing my property because that's always the first step. So they asked me the suspect. Indeed, there was someone I was suspecting. That was the first border border guy. But I did not enclose the name to the police. I told them that I first want if it happened that he's the one with I want first give him a chance. So I went to the community radio near that place. They don't have I wanted to pay for an announcement. Yeah, that's how important my iPad is. So when I was still there, then I saw a missed call from the guy I was working, the one was helping me. Uh so I called back before I paid the money. He told me, "Hey, by the way, you forgot your thing here. It's really costed me a lot of money. Yeah, because I used board. I was trying to beat catch up with time and come have some time. But I thank God that I have it. Amen. Praise be to God. So this morning I spend a night here praying. I was waiting on God, asking God, what can I do? What can I speak about? Praise be to God. But as I was praying, I just heard like the Holy Spirit whispering to me that we are not alone. Praise be to God. And that was that settled it. Praise be to God. I don't know what you're going through. I don't know the challenges you're facing. We don't know what we are facing. Amen. But one thing I'm sure of, we are not alone. And I believe God has a reason why he brought that message. Praise be to God. Amen. Just give me your undivided attention and I trust the Lord will speak to you. And where we have read, we are seeing uh the birth of Moses. [Music] Praise be to God. Moses was a prophet. And we are seeing how we uh we've read many time how God used him. And we know the story how they went in bondage, how they suffered there. Praise be to God. And you know it goes way back. It started with Joseph. Amen. And we shall speak a little bit about Joseph and we and we shall see how God protected Joseph. Praise be to God. Remember there is a mark of high calling and that is so important to us as Christians. And when apostle Paul says that laying aside we are supposed to lay aside everywhere. Amen. Every sin that was easily be set up and let us run toward that mark. Praise be to God. There is a mark of our calling that we are aiming at and whatever we are doing, no matter what we are going through, the challenges we are facing, we should focus our eyes onto Jesus. Jesus is that man. And as long as we are looking unto Jesus, we will never go wrong because he's the one leading the way. Praise be to God. Amen. When God met Moses and gave him the gave him commission to go and liberate Israel, he gave Abraham the promise. of the promised land. And Moses went with that message. Praise be to God. He was to liberate them from Egypt and take them the promised land. And we can say the mark of calling that time. It was the promised land. It wasn't the wilderness. It wasn't the Red Sea. Amen. It wasn't the Amalachites. Praise be to God. Amen. So when God met them, he only gave them one promise and that is the promised land. Amen. God never spoke about the Red Sea. No sir. He never spoke about the mountain. He never spoke about the wilderness. They were not supposed even to suffer in the wilderness as long as they had focused their eyes on God. Suffering came after they med against God and against Moses. Praise be to God. That is the way it was in the beginning. The prophet tells us that in the beginning when God created the world, when he created everything, everything was perfect. Amen. And he goes ahead and tells us how Adam named the animals, how he could call the lion and maybe use it as a pillow. Praise be to God. Worms had know that that kind of things. Amen. Trees had no thorns. Amen. Animals were not violent, they were friendly because sin had not come into the world. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But when man sinned against God, when man rebel against the word of God, sin, everything went into mess. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And from that time up to today, we are seeing anity. Animals are using their own for protection. And you realize man is the most dangerous animal. They fear you than even lion. We fear one another than even lion. Praise be to God. That's why someone will construct a house. He will put balance. He will put like three layers of windows. Then he will build a perimeter wall of 99. Then you put rest on top of it. You put electric on top. He'll put a camera. As if that is not enough, he will give a one of 360. The one which can rotate and monitor the whole place. Some put laser beam. motion sensors, alarms and security guards. And on top of that, they even have their guns. That is not to protect themselves against lion or buffalo, but against their fellow man. Praise be to God. There is the stress in the world. But there is a group of people in this earth, hallelujah, whose guns are invisible, whose weapons are invisible. And they are the most secured people on earth. Hallelujah. Men who are guarded by angels. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Men who can turn the world upside down. One man called Elishah. Elijah one day when the king troubled Israel and he met the king he told him praise be to God from this day hence for we will never have even a drop of rain not even a mere word spoken word praise be to God and I believe that was the revealed word of that hour when he spoke the word maybe maybe the king he just laughed at him you saw Elijah sometime you're old so you go extreme how can that happen so now you becoming a god you're even commanding them not to rain be serious Praise be to God. Let me tell you, God always work in simplicity. That's why message believers, they don't box the demons. We've seen people praying for someone who's possessed. You find there's love on them, speak them for as we speak. [Music] Amen. We declare and we decree. Hallelujah. Amen. And it happens. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. So I'm here to tell you this morning that brethren, we are not alone. We have God who created heavens and earth. But most times we remove our eyes from God and we look at the situation in front of us. We look at the condition around us. But this morning I want us to see things from different perspective. Amen. The way God want us to see it. Hallelujah. David one time says, "I was young, but now I'm old, but I have never seen a righteous forsaken." No, no. He said begging for bread. Amen. I believe David was speaking that when he was of age that God had never disappointed him all through his lifetime even when he sinned. God never disappointed. And here the man is giving a testimony. He say I was young but now I'm old but I have never seen righteous forsaken. Amen. God cannot forsake his own. We are part of God. And without you, God is not complete. Without you, brother, sister, Jesus is not complete. Let that sink in your heart. That without you, in your weak condition, in your need state, in your sick condition, God is not complete without you. For the Bible says we are the members of his body. Praise be to God. And remember God is perfect. So without you it means meeting is missing some part and we cannot believe in that God. when he comes and say now I'm God putting on flesh and is with one ears you will not accept that praise be to God but is a supernatural God. Praise be to God. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let us you go with me to Jeremiah chapter 29. [Music] vers 11. The longer I [Music] read, I know the thought I have toward you, says the Lord. The thought of peace, not bad thought. to give you hope to give unexpected hope. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Are you seeing the thought God has toward you that stamps the other one that we are not alone. God will bring us to an expected end. God has an image in his mind. He has a masterpiece in his mind and whatever he's doing is driving us toward that. Praise be to God. You will have hinderances alongside the way. Challenges will come. Sickness will strike your home. But all those things they are driving you toward unexpected end. Praise be to God. There is nothing that can stop that. There are not enough demons in hell that can stop that brother sister. Whatever comes our way it is a push toward that. Amen. How many have ever seen someone who knocks himself and falls behind? Praise be to God. When you're walking and knock away, you just go forward like three steps. Praise be to God. Amen. But most times when we hit on a stone, We complain about our toes and we forget the three steps ahead. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now whatever the devil is bringing our way. It is to push us forward, not to go backward. That is the working of God. Amen. God is a mathematician. There is no equation which God cannot solve. When the devil want to hurt our toys, God gives us three step ahead of the devil. Praise be to God. That's why Apostle Paul say all things work together for good for them who love God and for his purpose. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But many times we are looking at our failures. We are looking at the anarchs. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And he forget to look at the promise. We know that we are not alone. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why Jesus told us to pray every day. Pray without ceasing. Because when we pray, we shall know the will of God. When we pray, we shall get the direction of God. When we pray, the devil will give way. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He says, "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name." First of all, here you have to recognize that you have a father in heaven. You don't have a father in state house. You don't have a father at home, brother. It's not a father in the supermarket. There is a father in heaven. Hallelujah. Where angels are, where holiness comes from, where the fountain of healing is, where is. And when you have recognized that, that my father sits in heaven and you are just like your father. Your father is holy. Your father is righteous. Your father is powerful. Your father is able. Your father is rich. Your father is mighty. He has control over the nature. Control over your body. Amen. And he sits in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. And what is the kingdom? The prophet tells us, the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost. Praise be to God. Let the Holy Ghost come. Amen. And when the Holy Ghost will come, his will be will be done because the Holy Ghost will do the will of the father. Praise be to God. So God is thing the way God works or the way he operates. Everything is citulated. Praise be to God. You cannot do the will of the father without the holy spirit in you. But when the holy ghost comes in you automatically he will do the will of the father. We always refer the Holy Ghost like as an example of a magnet. When the magnet is in you, he will only pull the things which has magnetism in them. He will never pull a plastic. So when the Holy Ghost is in you, he will only attract the things of God in you. He will never attract the things of the world. Praise be to God. That's why we need the Holy Ghost. That's why every believer need the Holy Ghost. Every mother need the Holy Ghost. Every minister need the Holy Ghost. Every believer need the Holy Ghost. Yes sir. When the Holy Ghost comes in us, blessed be the name of the Lord. There you can walk and say, "I am not alone." When the Holy Ghost comes in you, these are the things going to to attract. He will pull healing. He will attract deliverance. He will attract joy. The Holy Ghost brings you happiness, godliness, patience, deliverance, gifts, prophecy, tongues, interpretation. That's why we need the Holy Ghost. Yes sir. That is a sign that we are not alone. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I will show I will give you an example as we move and we see men who had challenges in their life but they never walked alone and the challenges they had drove them. Hallelujah. Amen. It drove them to God toward God. We read about Moses. Hallelujah. When he was born, the mother never said. But I see this child is notorious. The way he looks the eyes, he looks the eyes, brother. The way the way he turns the eyes, it doesn't seem right. Probably you have not got any child. Not Moses's mother. Moses's mother knew. I prayed for this baby before he was conceived. I prayed for him when she was in the womb. And I'm praying for him at at the place of birth. Amen. The guy was already anointed. Praise be to God. He already attracted God. She attracted the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Spirit was with Moses. And when Moses was born, he was born a peculiar boy. Hallelujah. Those are the things done by the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost comes in your life, you will be a peculiar brother. You will be a peculiar sister. Hallelujah. That's what the Holy Ghost will do. Yes sir. You will not be the one who brings joke every time. Every time you you become a comedian, you find people you you've gathered the brethren and you find them laughing and maybe you think, "Hey, maybe uh maybe the P of God is moving their reach there, you see a brother showing them cartoon, receive the Holy Ghost. Praise be to God and you will never be alone. Either you love God or devil in your soul. You have to choose one. But this morning, I'm speaking to those who are walking with God. Hallelujah. There is one man in the Bible. This man walked with God. He lived for so many years. Hallelujah. Amen. The years of playing playing around. The Bible does not tell us that from Anoa's birth, he walked with God. But the Bible tells us. Hallelujah. After he reached a certain age, he gives us his geology. He was the seventh from Adam. Then he he begot sons and he begot sons and from there this one got this one and he live for this year. Hallelujah. And he walked with God. Praise be to God. Last Sunday we were told, we were told here, there are things which happen, things we go through when when we undergoing the growth it is natural. Praise be to God. But there must come a time where they say and brother Martin walked with God. Hallelujah. The man of 10 years ago is not the one of today. The one of today, he thinks different. He's careful. He knows where he's going. Hallelujah. Amen. But the one of 10 years ago, he used to play around, kiding around, kissing, teasing around. Praise be to God. But thanks be to God. Up to today, I'm still look at the mark of my God. Hallelujah. Amen. I have been beaten many times. I've been cast down many times, but I have never said, "God, I'm giving up. I have never cast God in my life. I've gone through challenges. I've gone through pain." Hallelujah. Amen. But despite the fact that all those things have happened, I am still moving on. It is not me moving on. Hallelujah. But there is someone walking with me. There is someone holding my hand. Praise be to God. I'm not walking alone. If if I was walking alone, I would have given up long time ago. Maybe at this time I would have been in a bar telling bartender had me on. Maybe I will not be married to a beautiful wife like my wife. Praise be to God. May we not be having beautiful flowers like I have. But all those are the benefit of not walking alone. Hallelujah. When God gives your wife, he gives you even [Music] overdose with all the nutrients. But don't forget, even when you're enjoying uh chicken, there is a bone somewhere. But even that bone is part of the chicken. Praise be to God. And what are those bones in sisters? There are some things that you just have to overlook and then you move on. Praise be to God. After all, if you get a chicken and you you remove all the bones from the all the bones from the what? How do they call it? From the meat, put them in the kilogram. Put them on a weighing scale and you you realize you have 10 kg of meat and a quart of bones. So those are not a big deal. Praise be to God. But when you are walking alone brother, the Bible says the way of transgressor is very hard. Yes sir. I remember one time uh one time pastoron was preaching and he was preaching about when someone is cast. Say when you are casting the city, Deuteronomy 28, they even cast in the village. But when you are cast in the village and maybe you are going to the city now, the c will enter the bus first and even the chicken they have given you in the village. But when you reach in the city, please let us cut and eat. That that chicken by the time you come out of the bus, you find when it was it was suffocated and even dead in the past because overtook you fast. Praise be to. Amen. And before you reach someone who's going to receive you, maybe you're like me who comes from the east and before you reach, the person gives you a call. Oh brother, I'm sorry. I've got a lot of problem. I will not be be able to have you at my place. I will let you know when things praise be to God. That's the danger of walking alone. That's why people hang themselves. The devil magnifies their problems and make them think that they're the only people suffering on earth. But before you think of your suffering, before you think of your trouble, I will offer you free transport and I will take you uh I'm talking of the person who thinks like that and we go visit the cancer institute. You'll realize you are the most health person on earth. One day I was very sick. I'm one person I think by the grace of God going to hospital maybe now that I think I'm now growing. I'm blessed the name of the Lord. And one day I went to the hospital and just something came in my mind to go and to some words. Brethren I want to tell you within just no minutes I was healed. I told God I am very fine. These are the sick just moved home. Praise be to God. We are not walking alone. We have a God. And this God is not just leading us anyhow. No sir. We are meandering in the wilderness. We are wandering in the wilderness. Because of our unbelief, this God knows where he's taking us. He has unexpected end. He has a thought of peace, not of suffering, not of pain. The pain we have today in our bodies. The trouble we are going in. The trouble sea we are sailing into it is just pushing us toward the the will of God. Praise be to God. You are not alone. You will never be alone. Even when you have trouble at work, you just you have a bad day. You have a friend. You have your big brother. You have your sister. You are undisputed. Amen. Praise be to God. Just keep pressing on. Tell the devil turn that circumstance into a blessing. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Tells us in the message as the ego stareth that in the eyes of the storm that's where the ego go few days two days ago I was laying a drainage system. So and also I was doing some maintenance of others which had some damages. There is something that I saw and it was so amazing. I went on the one on the last money hall man. These are the these are where the the two pipe are joined. So when we poured water there, I know that there are some rats living in those pipes and water was going toward the west and the end game of that pipe, it goes into the septic tank. [Music] Amen. So this thing tried to run but I think it realized by instinct maybe it used to to when the pipe was dry up to the end and the pip reaches here and this is a very a deep kind of septic of over 14 ft. [Music] So when the thing saw that the water was much, I was so shocked it decided to run toward the side where the direction where the water is coming from and the thing maneuvered. Praise be to God. That's why there is a saying that when the when you see the rat running toward the fire, you know what is chasing it, it's more dangerous than the fire. Praise be to God. But now here God has an expected end. This animal It realized if I run backward because I've been touring this place, I'm going to survive. If I fall in the safety, I'm going to drown. And indeed, that was it. These are animals without soul. But it's so beautiful. to see a child of God going toward sin [Applause] instinct. Praise be to God. He comes to church. He hears the word. The Holy Spirit moves. He enjoys the blessings of God. He goes out. it goes back to sin. You better pinch your conscience. But I'm here to tell you, you are not walking alone. If you're being if you've been doing those things, thinking that you are walking alone, know that there is a partner. There is a friend whom you have been hurting for all. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. God has a good thoughts toward us. He has a good plan for us. Praise be to God. Some even even when our children seems like they're going astray. Let us keep on our knees, knowing that God has a good plan for us. Amen. It is not yet over. Don't make the final conclusion that maybe he gave birth to serpent sin. Hallelujah. Amen. Don't make that conclusion. Praise be to God. It's not a serpent se until the end. Praise be to God. Why are you closing the ark in the seven days of grace? Hallelujah. Don't be brother Jonah. When God sent Jonah to Navy to go and preach the gospel and Jonah rebelled against God. Oh my God. Praise be to God. Now look here. Jonah thought that he was running away from God. Amen. But his rebellion, his disobedience draws him back to God. He refused to go to Navy and he went to Talis thinking was running away from God. But when he was cast into the sea, it was perfect will of God. Hallelujah. God had a special way. Not a speedboat this time. Not a titanic. No sir. It was a national speedy boat. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. The man thought now let me even die now. Oh God. Look here. Jonah when he was cast into the sea. I trust he thought that was his end. It is finished. Then in Jeremiah 29, I know the thought that I have church, are you seeing this? He thought it had ended. He thought he was finished. He thought he was going to drown and perish. Hallelujah. Amen. But God said that is not his son. It is not yet over. I know they thought that I have to worry. And when Jonah fell there, hallelujah. The well was waiting and swallowed the guy. And Jonah was deep there. He realized he was not swallowing water. He realized he was not in the bottom of the seat and again was not on the top of the seat. So he started touching around say that Jonah had the worst symptom. Yes. Before you think your symptom is nagging that my situation is so worse. He never even said that Job had worse. He said Jonah remember the word of God comes to the prophet surely sure the Lord God will do nothing. Blessed be his seven servants the prophet. He said when Jonah touched this time, he touched on the wells for it. When he touched this time, maybe we rotten fish and other things like that. Praise be to God. He had the worst symptom. You think that your stomach ache is the worst symptom compared to Jonah's symptom? Amen. Maybe you here and you are going undergoing pain and you have licked it. I want to speak to that problem and tell it now. It is not yet over. God has not finished with me. He has a good plan for this moment. is going to turn my stomach trouble into a testimony and one of his days. You are going to stand here and you tell the church, "God bless you. I've been battling with kidney problem for this years, but God has healed me. Praise be to God." and another sister at the corner will say, "Praise be to God." Maybe the one who is about to give up, he will be she will be encouraged by your testimony. And both of you will glorify God. What you have to know, God has a good plan for us. Yes, sir. Maybe you don't even have a plot, a piece of land. Yes, sir. Maybe you don't even have fears for next term. Maybe you are not even sure whether your mother will get healed. But I have a message for you. God has a good plan for you, not for only you, for your entire family. He's bringing you to unexpected end. And all those things happening around us is driving us toward that. Yes, sir. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. So when Jonah was in the well, Jonah never had any stop over. Yeah. Yeah. The well never had any [Music] stopover. It was called well express. Express. Well express. Amen. He refused to go the good way. It means to use the sheep. God said, "I have Oh, hallelujah." Amen. Jesus says, "If you stop them from praising, I can command these stones." Amen. When Jonah refused to use the ship, God had well expressed express when he fell inside. eat. He remained a little on the stage because when a fish eat something, according to the aquatic professionals, they say if something from water eats something, it goes at the bottom, it will just be there as it even a big snake when it swallows the python. When the python if it swallows something and say let me go look for another one. It can even take months in one place because it might swallow a cuff. Even all the bones and everything. So it sleeps as digestion takes place. But when Jonah entered that that stage, it remained somewhere. And it released that that insulin which beats up the food which breaks down those food. The food is not becoming soft. Praise be to God. This time the the became the Amen. Amen. I try to rest. Try to maybe try to vomit it. The thing will not come out. May it be it went to the colleague. Something is disturbing me. Praise be to God. The master was still under control. Amen. How did that started? May be there is a part which I'm which I was missing here. When Jonah was there for three days and three nights, he realized he was he was not dead. There was the seed of God in Jonah. Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe when he was in the in in well belly he started moving in the walls of what was he doing? He was looking for a network. He was moving there. You can you can pray from here. Praise be to God. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. When he got connected. Hallelujah. Amen. When the Bluetooth was connected and maybe had that sound Bluetooth connected connection, brother, sister started praying. Hallelujah. Amen. said, "Lord, you spoke." When they leave their eyes, he was in the B under the ocean. How did he know he was facing Jerusalem? The man was connected. Hallelujah. The man was connected, brother. So the network was pulling. The Bible says it the angel of the Lord come round about those who fears the name of the Lord. When the presence of God comes in you feel it when the angel is moving in the camp rather you feel the B. But for three days for the first day the man was struggling. The prayer was not moving. Have you ever woken up and pray and the prayer is not moving and you give up and begin talking to yourself and you again you start again. Praise be to God. But something was happening the second day. Hallelujah. He started filling the pool. He engaged the prayer gear. Hallelujah. The third day he forgot that he was in the belly of the fish. He was seeing the power of God. The Holy Ghost revealed to him that he was wrong. He rebelled against God. They say, "Oh God Almighty, you spake through your servant. will fall in trouble. He knew he was in the trouble. When he lift his eyes and look at Jerusalem, Jerusalem temple and pray to hear his prayer in heaven. Then the world started stomach ache, fever, yet it was in the water. Praise be to God. Amen. Then the master commanded, "Amen." I believe the well got confused. But also remember that it had a maker. The maker signaled the well and started. Praise be to God. The people of Nenev, they were worshiping idols. They had an God had their unexpected endon was not the God they supposed to worship in their ignorance. God had a special plan for them. Amen. And maybe it was their maybe it was their Christmas and they were around the beach that they enjoying sisters naked brothers putting on box children bathing and this hallelujah men on their shorts with their bish and all of a sudden the water was come. Hallelujah. Before they realized they saw something coming. So it is a sign of a wave. Oh, blessed be the name of God had a special gift for them. The well came to the seashore and be there. They had never seen their God in that in that manner. It was thus says the Lord. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. The man started to preach. Jonah realized he was not alone. He had a reason to preach. Now, if you're waiting for problem to come, you are Then you start evangelizing. Then you start preaching. I'm here to tell you it's just then at the neighbor's door coming. But don't wait for that. You better start now. Amen. Then Jonah preached like never before. Those people they believe. All of them believe. The king left the throne and he came down and covered himself with ashes and sack clothes. He commanded the entire kingdom with even animals. Yes. Animal fasted. Praise be to God. No food, no water. And God's word was removed from the people. And the will of God was performed in. And the Navian were brought to God's unexpected end. Rather, we have a God who has a plan for us before the foundation of the world. He designed us, created us, and worked on us. He shaped us according to his will. And that is where we are going. Nothing will stop us. Hallelujah. There's nothing that is going to stop us. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You see the plan God had for Jonah. Joseph was thrown in the dish by his brethren. And from there he was sold to Egypt. And when he was in Egypt he was in Porta's house serving there. report how her wife wanted to know Joseph. Joseph escape, he was imprisoned. All those things were driving Joseph to God's perfect will. Amen. When Joseph was in the dish, his brother said before that let us kill him. But is our brother you know shedding human blood is not easy. People who shed their friends blood their demon incarnate. Then one brought a suggestion. Let us throw him in the throw the guy there. And the guy was deep there crying. Baba brother Baba brother. Give me some water, brother. The whole night that was irritating. So they had to remove him. And the following was sold to those who buy slaves. But God had a plan for Joseph. Nothing could harm Joseph. No sir. But all those things were driving him toward his success. Hallelujah. Just imagine from the wilderness where he was with his brothers and from there Joseph went to Portifa's house he was a high ranking man. And from there he enjoyed those privileges from anyone. Then after that the man ended up in prison. Joseph never cast God. Sister, are you here? Did you cast God when you were there? Amen. He never cast. And even when he was in the prison, my brother, his brother had a gift in him. Amen. Amen. He started where he stopped. He was a son of prosperity. He had Jesus in him. And Jesus is the son of prosperity. When he was at Pifer's house, everything was organized. Everything was okay. Everything was flowing until the boss's wife say this man is even smarter than my husband. I wish I can get him. I believe he was looking good and behaving well with good discipline very very good putting on modestly. Anyhow, why do you put on those tight clothes? You look as if you're tied up. Not Joseph. I believe the man was organized and it was nice because he had the spirit of Christ and where the spirit of God is, there is liberty. There was liberty all over the man's home. All the chaos was kicked out until he was admired by Portfas. But God was driving him to his perfect will. When Joseph was in prison, he was there with those two guys. One was a butler. The other one have forgotten what he was doing. Yes. Amen. And then one came up with a dream. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I believe this guy even smiled. Say, "Hey God, you are even here. You have come." Because he knew this guys telling him the dream. God made them to speak their dream. because an interpreter was there. Amen. He interpreted the dream and it came to pass. God had a plan. He was not alone. Believers, we are not alone. We will never be alone. Even when Jesus died and we reached that death bed, when I come to the river at the ending of the day, when all the battle is won, there is somebody waiting to show us the way. Hallelujah. Amen. When we come to the end of the river, when the Lord brother and maybe we are going maybe we are we are dying of the whole earth. Oh God allowed us to be taken by sickness is still leading the way because the Lord God us all our but one thing we are sure of. Be sure that you are not alone. Be sure that you have the Holy Ghost. Visualize God leading your life. When you come to that time, you will give a smile. You'll tell them taking care of you at the hospital. And your relatives, this is my humble request. You've done your best. You've prayed, pastor. I've prayed. church. They are praying. You've done your best. Doctors have performed their part. Now relax. I'm going home. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. And if those people are believers enough, they will not go beyond that. I remember one time I told of a pastor He preached a sermon like this after when he had preached either night before I'm I'm forgetting either night before before he left he prayed for his family pray for the wife prayed for his children prayed for everything and then he left and that day he preached his last sermon. My wife don't be scared that my life. No, I'm here. I'm waiting for rapture. But if he calls me now, I'm still a winner either way. We are winner either way. Amen. Amen. When rapture takes us, the better. When God calls us now, we are winners. There is no losing in God. No loss because we are not alone. When we come at the end of the river, my angel will be there waiting for me. Your angel will be there waiting for you. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just know you are not alone. When you are sinning, know there is an eye washing you. When you are abusing, when you are arduing, mind you, there is an eye. Amen. Someone is watching at you. You are not alone. When you are sick, when you are hungry, don't steal because you are hungry. You are not alone. Amen. Amen. When there is no food, instead of stealing, use that tool as a blessing and tell the devil. Speak to hunger is not the devil. Stealing is the devil. The devil come and hide in the hunger. Speak to that hunger. and tell that hunger man shall not live by bread alone. Hallelujah. But by every word that comes from the mouth of God. Are you a student, you are school, you have run out of you have no sugar, no ginat, no pocket money. Your neighbor has forgotten his suitcase open. His suitcase is there open. And you seeing abundance of 200,000 5 kg of gut and your heart is pumping like like a heart. You are not alone. He's just washing at you. He won't see what are you going to do. Many time when I'm broke. When I go to the shop, you give the person 5,000 then they give a change of 40 48,000. What do you do? It always happens at night. You go to the mobile money, you withdraw 10,000 or 20, they give you 50. What do you do? You are not alone. Don't speak like our Muslim brothers. This is Allah has decided it but Jehovah's not decided and you are not a Moses. You are Christlike. We are Christians. Praise be to God. Just know you are not alone. But one thing I'm sure of When you overcome that temptation, two days will not elapse without a miracle. That is the God we are serving. Amen. That is the God we are serving. Brothers, we are not alone. There are many, many, many more examples. There are many people spoke about. Hallelujah. And as I'm finishing, my good lord, there is still a lot. But there are many examples people who thought they walking alone and Hannah was troubled. every penny is giving birth and I believe adding with even some bad words. I know my confused husband loves you so much. It's just because he's confused. I can give a wonderful woman like me. I'm giving birth, but I'm so beautiful. I look 20 yet I'm in my 40s. But you you look like a scrub man when he come he gives you a bigger portion that one of these days his eyes will be open and that's what the devil speaks to each one of us. Do you feel like a Christian? Are you bride of even Christ? You know Christ for I saw that I saw him there. You can't be his bride. And then you also accommodate the same thought. You did this. You're just from abusing your son. But you are praying. What are you praying? God is holy. And what you must be holy. And you listen to the guy's gospel. Brother, you already know what to do. When you hurt your husband, you know how to tune him. Praise be to God. Tell the devil. It is true. I've been abused accidentally. But that one does not take away my love for him. Amen. We made a vow. He made unconditioned covenant. Look the devil in his eyes. Tell him you blind but devil serpent. God have unconditional covenant. to begin with. I never chose him. He shows me the way I am with my life. He's working on me. I know what I'm going to be. He knows what he want me to be. Amen. And that is going to even improve your relation relationship with God. Lord, I've hurt you, Lord, but God, I'm sorry. Give me the grace not to do it again. And the devil will call in his tail. The devil has every bad description. The devil fell so deep. The Satan Satan fell so bad. He operates in B in sometime even in Iraq. He tried pigs but pigs were smarter than him. So the guy fell. He's in the drunkards in which adulterers, fornicators, how can you dare that guy is preaching to you a sermon. Don't even give him a second. The Bible say resist the devil and the devil will flee. Submit yourself to God. Throw near around to God. He will throw near to you. Resist the devil and the devil will flee. Shall we rise on our feet? Hallelujah. Amen. That is the God we shout. We are not alone. We have a God who moves the mountain. Do you have any mountain this morning? Are you troubled in your soul? I have brought you Jesus. And I and I challenge you this afternoon to open your hearts to Jesus Christ. I not got a sermon from the blue but God himself brought it and I trust you have a reason why he wanted to encourage us brother. My sister that we are not alone. Do not fear, do not worry. Musician, you give us that song of only belief. All things are possible because you have known that we are never alone. We are not alone. Brother, sister, Jesus is in our midst. He says two or three gathers in his name, he will come and be in their midst. That God who spoke in the beginning, the word into existence, who spoke your body, is here to correct you. He's here to heal it. Just lift up your hand this afternoon and believe Jesus that is here that is going to heal you. Maybe you are sick. You are troubled in your spirit. I challenge you this afternoon to believe the word of God to believe the message of the hour. I have quotes but I not even reached there. But my brother, my sister, I have preached you the full word of God because he told us he will never leave us again. A thousand will rise and 10,000 but not come near. They will come in one way. He will scatter them in seven direction. That same God spoke to Moses and told him that I will be with you. I will never leave you. I will never forsake you. That God spoke to Moses. He spoke to Joshua. Be of good courage. God spoke to Joshua. He specializes in things impossible. And that God is speaking to you this afternoon that you are not alone in that condition. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. You are not alone in that physical condition. You are not alone in that financial condition. But God is working it out for you. Whatever you're going through this afternoon will bring you to an expected end because he knows the plan he has toward you. It's only him who knows. That's why when the devil thought that he had finished Jesus God had a plan. He told Job I know he spoke to he spoke to this church and told them I know you are suffering. I know what you're going through. I know you are troubled. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why don't you speak to him this afternoon? Why don't you surrender your hearts to him? Maybe you are sick and athletic. I want to assure you in the name of the name which is sanctioned the name above all other names when that name is mentioned sickness will have to go one day that name was mentioned hallelujah at the gate of beautiful and the lame man he lived and he walked that name put on flesh which is the pool of path tiger and the sick man who was there for 38 years.
