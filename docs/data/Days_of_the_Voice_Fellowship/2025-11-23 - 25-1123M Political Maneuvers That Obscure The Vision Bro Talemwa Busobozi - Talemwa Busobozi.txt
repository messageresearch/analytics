But the Bible membership faith we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ washes us from all sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought online I saw brother Om God bless you brother. Amen. God bless you. Uh would you come and tell us what you are um planning? Cuz I people have been asking me is it a wedding? Is it ceremony. What is it exactly? Please come. They're planning a ceremony with his wife. Maybe for just a minute or two, you can be seated. You can come over here. God bless you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you, pastor. Uh I greet you in the name of the Lord. My name is Emanuel. Work in the army, air force in particular. And this is my second born. Uh my wife is uh over there. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, I call her my wife because the parents allowed me to go and wed her after we went to get introduced with a promise that I will take their which I am intending to fulfill next and I've been in touch with the pastor. Well, it's very supportive. Surely I really have to thank you. [applause] I intend on the 13th December, I'm sure with the help of the Lord and my brethren here, I can say I'm so grateful for this [applause] just shortly when I I some years ago We used to stay somewhere in. &gt;&gt; So when I was going for my military course, we shifted here. The next day I was supposed to leave. I didn't know this church was here. So my wife after a long hassle in the in the in the course, she told me I have got a home and truly I can assure you this is home. [applause] I can talk more and very many many more. I can just stop in there. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you first. &gt;&gt; All I invited you. So 13th December, where is it going to be? Toro at sister Ruth's place. So, as we heard, they already wed. This is going to be like just a ceremony, but you know, they've they told me they just wanted to really be an opportunity for the family people to hear the word and uh so maybe they'll just try to make some time in the middle of the proceedings so that we can preach the word. I I know on the same day sister sister sister Martha also their children organized to give do an introduction ceremony. So uh but I told her you know brother brother brother Omn told me about this almost a year ago. So I am needed on both functions. I don't know how I'm going to do it. One is in one is so but I think we would sister maybe s sister ma will have to understand because um and I know she might be hearing uh perhaps maybe we can have one of the ministers. God has blessed DVF with good ministers. We appreciate God for that. Amen. And so yesterday we were at the wedding uh ceremony of brother brother &gt;&gt; Joseph who I believe is on his people are checking where he certainly you don't expect him to be there unless he's a man of real faith. I'm not saying he doesn't have reason but myself and my wife we were we came to church. We understand if someone doesn't you're tired after all the ceremony brother Joseph wanted to thank God for his ceremony because man did not give me a lot of headache. He took responsibility for his function and did and did most much much of the planning much of the planning really at the end. We're just all along just going to see how guiding to see how and so thank you to those who came and I know many did not come but many some came from But I wanted to tell you this. Even if you're not invited to go to the reception, if you're a part of the church and a young man or young lady here is married, regardless, please come at least and be in the church. That alone is encouraging to him. You know on weddings we usually have a lot of new people that come really a lot of new people that you have family the families of the boys friends these people are not believers an opportunity to as a church to reach out to them. I gave you the testimony last Sunday. Brother Hapto now who is um you know you know ministering and is in Canada now one of those that believed in the first years in Ethiopia received the message because his friend invited him during his engagement and then by the time he was coming for the wedding to be the best man he was already a believer. baptized. So what I I wanted to encourage you friends, you are expected to be here when we have a wedding. You if you're not invited to the reception, you are free to go home after that. But but uh I would encourage you to please always come on the wedding ceremonies. Is that a man church? God bless you if you things went very well and uh we thank God for that. Sister Mariam and his pastors were here. They told me they always stream our services. We thank God for uh for them and and for what they doing there. Amen. Amen. Also, I wanted to mention that pastor Joshua is here. Please stand. Pastor Joshua is a young man that has um you know he came and met me some years ago. How many years ago is that? &gt;&gt; Three years is when we we first met. you can be seated. And he he had he came and told me that he had a burden. And this burden was to go to uh back to his home place. And God, the Holy Spirit specifically gave him this uh the name of a town where he should go and evangelize. And so he obeyed without having any money, without having knowing what to do. who you were determined. But you see, he obeyed and he went. Don't you think that is wonderful? That's really wonderful. So, we've uh tried to stand with him. We will see what the Lord has in the store in the future. I've been even there to see what he's doing. And uh this week I have been very busy. uh you know as you know that uh when I returned from the trip I did not rest well. I believe you know when I came back friends I came back with a heavy burden that I have to do all I have to do while I have the grace and the chance the opportunity to do it for the Lord. And so I I mean I saw I saw especially I was so impacted you know when I was at Clo &gt;&gt; and I was taken in this room and I saw a lot of tapesh that brother Ed had preached over the years. But I also saw, you know, just to see and see the years that did back and how much this one man and with many standing with him that he had accomplished for the Lord and how much impact his ministry had all over the world. So I came you know with a zeal to do more for them. So that's why I did not rest. I immediately went to uh West Nile. I was here on Sunday. Um still struggling with jet lag. So then I on Tuesday did I travel on Wednesday? On Tuesday? Yeah, on Tuesday on Tuesday we went to on Monday we were trying to purchase some computers &gt;&gt; that we would u and then on Tuesday. &gt;&gt; I was in touch with the pastors there and they had they had already been trying to look around to see the people that fit the qual that would propose and think that they are able to do the work of translation. So they brought me about how many were there? 14. Yeah. So we we spent time with I needed only four. So we spent time with them and uh you know to to what you would want to call it maybe an interview or something you know to check how how's the computer skills how is the knowledge of the message studying of scriptures and you know how how much they can be able to do. So, we were able to get the number we needed. And then in the middle of it all, the Holy Spirit reminded me of Brother Joshua. Um, I remembered that he had told me that he was already I remembered the Holy Spirit just brought it back to me. We had just had a light moment and he told me he had told me that he was already starting to do translation on his own. and uh but he could not be able to continue because of you know many reasons. He was trying because he wanted to get the message into his life to his own people and so I called him immediately and well long story short he's one of the the team one of that team that is going to translate. Amen. And uh he's also a pastor in that town now. How many believers do you do you have? Yes. From nothing now to 15. I think that is a that is the hand of God. and he has not even been cons like very busy there because he had to also look for a living and you know I'M ALWAYS ON FIRE WHEN I SEE another fellow younger man on fire for I used to call myself the youngest preacher in the message but these days I also have others I can call younger men it means that time is really rushing you may think you are young but time is going. So do what you have to do for the Lord while you can do it because the the the you know the evening the end of the end of time is just closing on us. Amen. We appreciate you brother Joshua and what you are doing for the Lord. We will have you come and minister to us one time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, are you happy this morning? Amen. We uh we are going to have this next Saturday &gt;&gt; the ceremony of brother uh Enoch. &gt;&gt; Uh it's not going to be the wedding ceremony on this Saturday. It's going to be the introduction introduction, right? Yeah. At his um fiance's home. So you remember him in prayer. He still is in much need. But uh this is not a wedding. It's just introduction ceremony. Let's pray for him that all go well. And lastly also remember to pray uh on the third week of uh weekend of December. I've been invited to Kamoja for a convention major convention. These people are usually in thousands. We need to remember those meetings. Shall we stand and we go into the word? I know also brother Julius has been invited in one of the you know this some of the brothers called me and they said to have him go and support in the in the meetings some youth some deaths in December I think. So we are happy to pray for him and stand behind. So we are going to the book of Amos chapter 3. This morning I was at uh with a group of seven. We went to St. Henry's College Henry's &gt;&gt; and we had a very good service there and uh one soul gave their heart to God. And I believe God will give us grace there because the the the director said he will invite us more and more. They're not even believers of the message. But uh you know &gt;&gt; it means that praise and noble have had a good testimony because they have influenced the administration to invite us. If you are a student always do something at your school. God has sent you there as an ambassador. Amen. Amen. So we are reading Amos 3:7 and we will be seated after that. Can we read it together? We Okay, we have it on the screen so you can look up here and let us read it together. &gt;&gt; Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets. Amen. You may be seated. I have it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to speak for long, but I have a lot to say this morning uh that the Holy Spirit has laid on my heart. I had to leave the wedding uh a little early yesterday. I was having this burden but I did not know exactly how to approach this subject. So I needed to you know spend time in the presence of God. And so I had one hour to rest in the night and I had to wake up early to go to the school. So when we came back, I rested another one now to be here this morning. And I just I'm feeling, you know, I'm feeling good and I hope that you're feeling good also believing that the Holy Spirit will minister to us. And um today I just want to deal with a subject of political maneuvers that obscure the vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if my pronunciation of obscure obscar is is perfect. I don't know. But the word there means hinder. Political maneuvers. I'm I'm praying and I'm requesting you church to give me your undivided attention. Let us let us be shut in with God and avoid movements. And if possible, you switch off your phone or put it in silence. Check it. If you're not sure, check it now so you don't get interrupted. Mine was not in silence. So, check your phone as well and be sure. so that you're not interrupted. Praise the Lord. Ask your neighbor, are you ready for this? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I said, praise God. Amen. Now, I'm talking about a vision and then political maneuvers. You see, God always has the vision for the church. And when I say the church, I not only refer to the New Testament body of believers, I not only talk about that. However, I am also referring to his people at every season, every generation. every time in history. We can even bring it down and say every city, every location, every place, including here in you see God has a vision and we can also put it now in times and say, you know, the time we are living in, you know, God always has a a vision. YOU SEE, BEFORE HE DOES anything major, he always sends his man that he would anoint a man that he would sanction. A man that HE WOULD USE TO CARRY OUT a mission, a mission that would fulfill the vision God has for his people. You understand what I'm saying? There are great men that have come and gone. But you see, the vision of God must always be accomplished. You see, we need leaders. God always gives us leaders both in politics and spiritually and physically, naturally. We all have leaders. We need to be led. If you WANT TO GET ANYWHERE, YOU ALWAYS have to accept to be led. Okay? But if you don't acknowledge, the leadership OF GOD FOR your season, for your life, then you are set UP FOR FAILURE. SO WE DON'T always see you know like God he has from generations before us always sent men but we ARE NOT FIT according to people's judgment. You remember the scripture we READ IT SAYS GOD WILL do nothing. HE WILL DO NOTHING. IF YOU WANT GOD TO DO SOMETHING, HE HAS TO SEND A MAN. He has TO SEND A PROPHET. IF HE DOESN'T SEND A PROPHET, HE WILL DO NOTHING. AND I TELL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFENDED by the prophet of this house, A MAJOR PROPHET, GOD HAS SENT TO OUR GENERATION AND THEY ARE OFFENDED AT IT, THEN THEY GOD WILL DO NOTHING FOR THEM. BUT TO THOSE OF YOU WHO RECEIVE THE PROPHET GOD SENDS FOR OUR SEASON FOR OUR GENERATION, GOD WILL DO EVERYTHING FOR YOU. WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE LIKE GOD FROM GENERATIONS BEFORE US AND YOU HAS ALWAYS SENT MEN. BUT THIS MAN ACCORDING to people's JUDGMENTS ARE ALWAYS NOT FIT. In the DAYS OF THE FLOOD, HE SENT NOAH, a man that was old, a man that probably was A DRUNKARD, A MAN WHO WAS NOT WORTHY, MAYBE HAD NO DIFFERENCE WITH HIM, BUT THE BIBLE SAYS NOAH FOUND GRACE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD. SO, IT WASN'T THAT NOAH WAS BETTER THAN THEM. GOD CHOSE HIM AND GOD SENT HIM BECAUSE HE WAS THE MAN THAT GOD HAD CHOSEN TO USE AT THAT HOUR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And you know when GOD CHOOSES A MAN, HE ALWAYS HAS A WAY, HE ALSO TAKES from his home and family. No, when he chooses a man on that line of the calling, he also chooses his family. Did you know that? I want you to THINK ABOUT IT. GOD SENDS A PROPHET TO THE WHOLE WORLD. ONE PROPHET to the whole world. In that time, it was perhaps more developed than this, more civilized. But God chose one man to the whole WORLD AND HIS MESSAGE WAS THE ONLY MESSAGE WAS THE ONLY MESSAGE THAT CAME FROM GOD. IF NOAH DIDN'T SPEAK, GOD DIDN'T SPEAK. IF NOAH DIDN'T COME, GOD WOULD DO NOTHING. AND HIS MESSAGE WAS REFUSED BY THE WHOLE WORLD. WAS REJECTED BY THE WHOLE WORLD. BUT THAT DID NOT HINDER GOD. UNBELIEF CANNOT HINDER GOD. IF NO ONE BELIEVES THE MESSAGE, THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEBODY, [screaming] SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE THAT GOD HAS ORDAINED TO RECEIVE THAT MESSAGE. IF GOD SENDS A MAN, THERE IS SOMEONE SOMEWHERE [screaming] THAT WILL BELIEVE IN THAT MINISTRY, THAT WILL RECEIVE THAT MINISTRY. AND THAT MAN, YOU SEE, Noah walked with GOD AND HE DID WHAT GOD TOLD HIM TO DO. THINK ABOUT IT. Only eight people were saved at that time. Who are they? All family members of the house of Noah. Have you thought about it? Now ask yourself a question. How come you send a message to the whole world and only one family would feel safe? Why didn't he just kill everybody and save that family? Because people have a choice. WHEN GOD SENDS YOU A A MAN, YOU HAVE A CHOICE, BELIEVE HIM and that man will HELP YOU. BUT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT MAN, THAT MAN CANNOT HELP YOU. EVEN IF HE'S ANOINTED WITH A FLOWING ANOINTING, THAT MAN CANNOT HELP YOU. You know, brother, I'm saying, YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN PEOPLE AND TALK ABOUT THEIR PASTOR, RIDICULE HIM, AND DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS. HOW CAN THAT MAN EVER HELP YOU? HE CANNOT HELP YOU. RIGHT? SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN THE MAN FIRST to to hear from God. AND YOU SEE GOD TOLD BROTHER BAM, the prophet of this. He spoke to him and he said, &gt;&gt; you know, if people if you will make the people to believe you want people to believe me, if you will make the people to believe you, IT WILL COME TO PASS that not EVEN CANCER will stand before you. THINK ABOUT IT THAT THEY HAD TO BELIEVE THAT WILLIAM BRANA IS A PROPHET TO THIS GENERATION. THAT IS A MAN OF GOD THAT GOD HAS SAID AND THEY HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT AFTER THEY BELIEVE IT WHATEVER DISEASE THEY HAVE IT COULD NOT STAND BEFORE THE ANOINTING THAT WAS UPON WILLIAM. YOU see that's how God works in the days of Noah. SAME THING. IN THE DAYS WHEN ISRAEL HAD FORSAKEN GOD, he sent them the prophet HOSEA WHO MARRIED GMA, A PROSTITUTE, &gt;&gt; A PROPHET OF GOD, MARRYING A PROSTITUTE. HE WAS A MAN [screaming] SENT FROM GOD, ANOINTED FOR THAT. WHY DID GOD ALLOW HIM TO MARRY A PROSTITUTE? GOD WAS SHOWING THAT THE SITUATION AND ATMOSPHERE, &gt;&gt; THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH, THEY'RE LIVING IN SPIRITUAL ADULTERY. [screaming] THEY THEY'RE LIVING IN IMMORALITY. THEY'RE GOING AFTER OTHER MEN. THEY'RE GOING AFTER OTHER IDEAS. [screaming] INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER ME, MY WIFE, MY HUSBAND, BUT THEY HAVE REFUSED ME. THEY HAVE GONE UNTO OTHERS TO SEEK FOR THEIR DESIRES. AND SO GOD TOLD THE MAN OF GOD, "MARRY A PROSTITUTE." AND THIS PROSTITUTE WAS GOING AFTER OTHER MEN, WHILE SHE WAS [screaming] MARRIED TO THE PROPHET OF GOD. WHY GOD ALLOWED IT WAS TO SEND A MESSAGE SO YOU COULD JUDGE THE MAN OF GOD ALL YOU LIKE. BUT HIS LIFE WAS A TESTIMONY IN THAT GENERATION. YOU COULD TRY TO MANEUVER AND TRY TO TO DISCARD HIM AND SAY HE'S NOT WORTHY AND HE'S NOT FIT FOR THE CALLING. BUT GOD HAD CHOSEN HIS MAN [screaming] AND IT WAS IN THE PROGRAM OF GOD WHATEVER HE WAS DOING WITH THAT MAN. LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WHEN GOD CALLS A MAN, GOD WANTS TO GUIDE THAT MAN. GOD WANTS TO LEAD THAT MAN. HE DOESN'T WANT THE CHURCH TO LEAD HIM. HE DOESN'T WANT THE CHURCH THE CHURCH TO CONTROL HIM. HE DOESN'T WANT THE MAN TO GUIDE HIM. HE WANTS HIMSELF [screaming] TO LEAD AND GUIDE HIM. THAT'S WHY HE SAY THE CHURCH IS NOT LED BY A SET OF DEACONS. A CHURCH IS NOT CONTROLLED BY A COMMITTEE. A CHURCH. YOU KNOW, GOD DOESN'T NEED YOUR MIND FOR HIM TO DO WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. GOD SENDS HIS MIND WITHOUT ASKING FOR YOUR OPINION AND THEN HE USES HIM [screaming] THE WAY HE WANTS TO USE HIM. THAT'S WHY EVERY CHURCH IS SOVEREIGN. [screaming] GOD PUTS A MAN THERE. HE ANOINTS HIM. HE SPEAKS TO HIM. HE GIVES HIM THE WORD AND THAT MAN IS ANSWERABLE TO GOD AND IS ACCOUNTABLE TO GOD. WHATEVER HE PREACHES, GOD WILL JUDGE HIM. [screaming] SO DON'T JUDGE HIM. LET GOD JUDGE HIM BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SEND HIM. THAT GOD WHO SENT HIM ALWAYS JUDGE HIM. IF YOU RECOGNIZE THAT GOD HAS CALLED A MAN, JUST SUPPORT THAT MAN. IF YOU THINK THE MAN IS OFF, PRAY FOR THAT MAN AND GOD WILL REWARD YOU AS WELL. AMEN. AND AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE STORY OF GMA is wonderful. Well, I believe those are their names. When David became so sinful, God sent them the prophet, A MAN WHO WAS NOT ONLY A NONITIZEN OF NINEVEH, BUT ALSO THE MAN WHO DEBATED WITH GOD. UNTIL TODAY, PEOPLE SEND JONAH WAS A FOR WAS A A A FALSE PROPHET. WHO WAS how do they call him? They say he someone knows the word. A dis a runaway prophet, a disobedient prophet. Wait a moment. Was he a prophet or not? &gt;&gt; HE WAS A PROPHET. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN? &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD IN HIS MIND, HE HAD CHOSEN JONAH [screaming] AND HE KNEW HE WOULD SEND HIM. GOD CHOSE JONAH, &gt;&gt; NOT FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. BUT HE SENT JONAH AND HE CHOSE JONAH FOR I DON'T KNOW [screaming] WHERE ELSE JONAH WENT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE JONAH ACCOMPLISHED. BUT WHAT I KNOW [screaming] JONAH HAD A TH SAYETH THE LORD FOR ONE CITY. [screaming] GOD CAN CALL A MAN FOR ONE CITY. GOD CAN CALL A MAN FOR ONE MINUTE. GOD CAN CALL A MAN FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE. [screaming] GOD DOES WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. AND WHEN HE CALLED JONAH, JONAH DISOBEYED GOD. BUT EVEN THAT [screaming] WAS A PART OF THE BLOOD OF HELL. HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN JESUS CAME, THEY SAID, "GIVE US A SIGN. SHOW US A SIGN." JESUS SAID, "YOU WANT A SIGN? I HAVE NO OTHER SIGN TO GIVE YOU. BUT I GIVE YOU THE SIGN OF [screaming] PROPHET JONAH." AMEN. AMEN. HOW HE WAS IN THE WHALE'S [screaming] BELLY FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHT. THAT WAS A SYMBOL. THAT WAS A SIGN THAT WAS SAYING THE MESSIAH IS COMING. AMEN. HE WILL DIE FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHT, BUT THEN RISE AGAIN AND BRING SALVATION TO THE WORLD. YOU SEE JONAH PROPHESIED THEY WERE GOING TO DIE BUT THEY WERE SAVED. That was a SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. THOSE WHO RECEIVE THE MESSIAH THEY CANNOT DIE. THEY WILL ALWAYS BE SAVED. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS AMEN WE ARE DEAD AND OUR LIFE IS HID WITH GOD IN CHRIST. [cheering] WE CANNOT DIE THE SECOND TIME. WE DIED ONCE AND THAT SETTLES IT. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE RESURRECTION. HALLELUJAH. I SAY HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God chose Jonah anyways. YOU COULD DEBATE WITH GOD ALL YOU WANT. YOU COULD JUDGE JONAH ALL YOU WANT. BUT GOD [screaming] IS SAYING JONAH IS MY PROPHET. WHEN ISRAEL THOUGHT THEY WERE comfortable with the Lord, God sent John THE BAPTIST. &gt;&gt; WHO WAS JOHN THE BAPTIST? HE WAS A REBEL WHO LIVED A QUESTIONABLE LIFE. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE FATHER OF JOHN THE BAPTIST IS CALLED ZECHARIAH. WHO HAS GOD ZECHARIAH? THIS MAN WAS A PROPHET OR RATHER A PRIEST and he served in the temple. Amen. and and HIS MOTHER WAS ELIZABETH. AND THIS WOMAN WAS BARREN. THIS IS THE same woman, YOU KNOW, WHO MET JESUS OR RATHER WHO MET MARY BECAUSE SHE WAS A COUSIN OF MARY. AND AT THAT TIME, YOU KNOW, SHE HAD A WOMB. BUT THIS WOMB WAS ALMOST DEAD. JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS IN THERE. ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? AND THEN MARY CAME. MARY WAS THE WOMAN. THAT ARE FULFILLED SCRIPTURE. UNTO US A SON IS BORN, A CHILD IS GIVEN. You know THE MESSIAH WAS IN THAT WOMB. A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE BRING FORTH A SON. THAT SCRIPTURE WAS FULFILLING MEN. THEY WERE COUSINS, BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT EACH OF THEM WAS FULFILLING PROPHECY. GOD IS IN THE BUSINESS OF USING RELATIVES. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? EVEN WHEN IT CAME TO ISRAEL, HE TOLD THEM, "LOOK, I AM GOING TO CHOOSE ONE TRIBE. THE ONE OF LEVI, THAT ONE IS MINE." AMEN. YOU GO AND WORK AND GET THE LANDS. LET THE REST BRING GOD ALL THEIR TITHES AND TITHE TO THIS ONE. GOD USED ONE TRIBE. I CAN SAY GOD USED ONE family to BE PRIESTS IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY AND FOREVER. THAT'S WHY MANY TIMES LOOK AT EVERY PREACHER YOU KNOW. AMEN. IF THEY WERE IF THEY WERE IF THEIR FATHER WAS NOT A PREACHER, THEIR GRANDFATHER WAS. IF THEIR GRANDFATHER WAS NOT, THEIR GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS. AND SOMETIMES IF YOU THINK THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY MINISTER IN THEIR FAMILY is only because you do not know the generations before. WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY? GOD IS INTO THE BUSINESS OF DEALING WITH RELATIVES. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M SAYING THIS. ALL I'M SAYING IS I'M SEEING IT IN THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; MARY [screaming] WAS RELATED to Elizabeth. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH WAS RELATED TO MARY AND THEY GOING TO GIVE BIRTH TO CHILDREN WHO ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER. AND THESE CHILDREN, ONE WOULD BE THE MESSIAH, ONE WOULD BE THE PREPARE THE PREPARER TO prepare for the Messiah. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND AND WHEN JOHN WAS DEAD, &gt;&gt; JESUS YES. &gt;&gt; WHILE BEING IN THE WOMB OF MARY [screaming] RESURRECTED HIM QUICKENED HIM. YOU KNOW, AS THEY HUGGED THE WOMB OF MARY TOUCH THE WOMB OF ELIZABETH, her womb, A CHILD WAS QUICKENED. AND THE BIBLE TELLS ME JOHN RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST IN his mother's. [screaming] What do you want TO DO WITH THAT SCRIPTURE? AMEN. THERE IS NO FORMULA OF RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST. GOD GIVES IT TO WHOEVER HE DESIRES. [screaming] AMEN. AMEN. HE HATED ESAU. AND HE LOVED JACOB BEFORE THEY WERE BORN. I AM SO GLAD THIS MORNING. I AM AN ELECT OF GOD. I AM A SEED OF GOD. I WAS IN THE MIND OF GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF the world. AND YOU KNOW THIS CHILD CAME FORTH AND THE FATHER WAS A PRIEST. BUT BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING. THIS boy rebelled. He didn't come to church. He refused. WHEN OTHERS WERE VERY BUSY FULFILLING THE LAW FOR HIM, HE WAS very busy doing and living against the law. See how he kept HIS HAIR. YOU THINK IT WAS NORMAL? NO, IT WAS a priest had you you if you go in the Old Testament in Leviticus and you read the qualifications of PRIEST the way they had to do their beard their hair AND EVERYTHING. JOHN WAS OPPOSITE. They even they THEY EVEN GOD EVEN TOLD THEM WHAT TO EAT. JOHN WENT AGAINST THAT TOO. HE ATE LOCUST and wild honey. John did NOT EVEN LEAVE. THEY EVEN HAD TO LIVE IN INDEENT ENVIRONMENTS. WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING DEAD, [screaming] they even had TO BE CLEANSED FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS. JOHN LIVED IN THE FOREST IN THE BUSH. THAT IS STICKING THINGS. SO HE HE WAS DISQUALIFIED AS A PRIEST. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN GOD HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WENT OVER THE PEOPLE'S FAULT. AND HE SENT JOHN. THAT'S WHY JOHN WAS NOT RECEIVED AS THE ELIJAH. AND WHEN JESUS THE MESSIAH CAME, HE SAID, "IF YOU WILL RECEIVE IT, THIS MEANING JOHN WAS THE ELIJAH [screaming] WHICH WAS FOR TO COME." MEANING, I KNOW IT IS HARD FOR IT TO RECEIVE. BUT I TELL YOU, [screaming] JOHN WAS ELIJAH. JOHN WAS ELIJAH. BUT STILL, THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. ONLY THE ELECT CAN UNDERSTAND. EVEN IN OUR GENERATION, WILLIAM BRHAM [screaming] IS THE ELIJAH IS THE MALACHI 4 TO OUR GENERATION. BUT THEY CAN'T RECEIVE IT BECAUSE [screaming] THEY ARE NOT ORDAINED TO RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE TO BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. BUT YOU AND I, MY BROTHER, [screaming] WE ARE ORDAINED BY BE BELIEVERS OF THIS MESSAGE. WE SAY ELIJAH IS COMING. ELIJAH IS COMING. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; JOHN THE BAPTIST &gt;&gt; WAS, you know, QUESTIONABLE &gt;&gt; and he was a rebel, &gt;&gt; but yet God called him. ALL MEN THAT GOD SENT TO HAVE A TURNING POINT AT EVERY SEASON OR GENERATION, they never felt they themselves that they were QUALIFIED and the people never APPROVED OF THEM. Only God thought they were the right MEN for the mission that would fulfill God's vision for his people. Exodus 3. Brethren, I'm beginning to move. Please, please. Try your best to sit for at least one hour. Exodus 3:7. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I'm reading there to try and show you the example of Israel when God called Moses. And the Lord God said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt. And I've heard their cry by reason of their task masters. For I know their sorrows. And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of the that land, and unto a good land, and a large, and unto a land flowing with milk and honey, to a place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Heivites, and the Jebites. Now therefore, behold, a cry of the children of Israel is come unto me, and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt. And Moses said unto God, Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh, and I should bring forth the children of Israel out of the Egypt, out of Egypt? And he, excuse me, vers 12. And he said, suddenly I would bring I'll be with thee, and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt. Ye shall serve God upon this mountain. Now I want you to see that Moses. When God sent him, Moses quickly felt unworthy to do this noble work. That's why brother Bham tells us the man that wants TO DO THE JOB IS NOT the man that God wants for the job. BUT THE MAN WHO DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT, THAT'S THE ONE THAT God has called. YOU UNDERSTAND? NO ONE MAN OF God that God has ever called, has desired or wanted or was fighting for doing what God wanted. It has always been a am I worthy? Am I prepared? Am I the right guy? And you know, THERE'S THAT SEASON WHERE YOU HAVE TO STEP BACK and listen and ask yourself, am I the am I the God? Am I the man that God really HAS CALLED? SO MOSES WHEN GOD TOLD HIM, he felt quickly unworthy. HE SAID, "GOD, WHO am I?" You remember I preached on a man. I'm a man under divine assignment. YOU know when GOD CALLS THAT MAN, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MAN. It's about the divine assignment that THAT DID YOU KNOW GOD GAVE AN ASSIGNMENT EVEN TO THE PERSON that bore you naturally. YOU SEE, GOD DETERMINED WHO WOULD BE YOUR FATHER and your mother. SOME OF YOU ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER YOU HAVE. SOME OF YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE BELIEVERS, others because they disappointed you in life and you ended up here. You end up believing the message. I AM ONE OF THOSE. WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY? GOD DETERMINED WHO WOULD BE YOUR FATHER BECAUSE HE GAVE THAT MAN AN ASSIGNMENT. RAISE MY SON. THERE'S AN ASSIGNMENT FOR HIM. But he COULD NOT SAY NO. AMEN. IF GOD HAD [screaming] PICKED THAT MAN, THAT MAN CANNOT SAY NO. IF GOD HAS SPEAK TO YOU, BROTHER, IF GOD HAS SPEAK, YOU CANNOT SAY NO. WELL, YOU CAN TRY BUT YOU CANNOT MANAGE TO SAY NO. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT GOD HAD PREPARED MOSES FOR THIS JOB RIGHT BEFORE HE WAS IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB WHATEVER GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO DO. HE PREPARED YOU BEFORE YOU WERE IN YOUR MOTHER. YOU ARE PREPARED. I SAY I AM PREPARED. DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR WEAKNESSES. DON'T WORRY [screaming] ABOUT YOUR FAILURES. AM I PREACHING TO SOMEONE HERE TODAY? IF YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED BY GOD, YOU HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY GOD AND YOU MUST DO WHAT GOD CALLED YOU TO DO. YOU MUST ACCOMPLISH IT. IT'S NOT EASY THOUGH. But you have to do it. Beautiful things are always found in thorns. You are that one. THERE ARE THORNS AROUND YOU. BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE THORNS. WORRY ABOUT THE ROAD [screaming] IN THE middle of the throne. GOD HAD A PURPOSE FOR HIS LIFE. HE HAD ORDAINED HIM TO CARRY OUT A mission that WOULD FULFILL God's vision. AMEN. IS IT AMEN, CHURCH? ALL RIGHT. Let deacons ask those who are outside to come and feast. If you feel it is hot, just come in and let it be hot. But God will help you. I remember in Tabernacle, they used to stand way behind because the chairs were all full and they would stand through a three-hour service. And I'm not even going to probably maybe preach half of it. Let us go through this. Tell your neighbor, "LET'S GO THROUGH THIS." &gt;&gt; AMEN. Exodus 3. Exter 3. This morning, God has anointed me with THIS INSPIRATION. And I hope it will help you TO SEE what God is doing in your life and in our generation. Verse three. AND I AM COME DOWN. [screaming] This is God DECLARING HIS VISION. AND I AM COME DOWN. TO DELIVER THEM OUT OF the hand of the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I prophesy? &gt;&gt; CAN I PROPHESY? [screaming] GOD HAS COME DOWN THIS GENERATION TO DELIVER YOU TO DELIVER ME OUT [screaming] OF THE HANDS OF THE EGYPTIANS. AMEN. AMEN. CALL ME A FANATIC IF YOU LIKE. AMEN. THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; BUT HOW DOES GOD COME DOWN? GOD COMES DOWN THROUGH SENDING A MESSENGER WITH A MESSAGE [screaming] OF RESTORATION. [cheering] I'M COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM out of the hand of the EGYPTIANS AND TO BRING THEM UP OUT OF THAT LAND UNTO A GOOD LAND AND A LARGE UNTO A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK and honey. God wanted to take THEM TO A LAND. GOD WANTED TO TAKE THEM TO THAT WAS THE VISION. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO TAKE US TO OUR LAND. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; COME ON, [screaming] RECEIVE THE REVELATION. GOD WANTS TO TAKE US TO OUR LAND. AMEN. AMEN. [screaming] AMEN. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? BEFORE GOD TAKES THEM TO OUR LAND, HE HAS TO SEND THEM A MAN AND ANOINT HIM WITH THE ANOINTING OF THIS VISION. [screaming] HOW IT IS GOING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. &gt;&gt; IF THEY BELIEVE IN THAT MAN, THE VISION WILL COME RIGHT QUICK. IF THEY DON'T, THE VISION WILL STILL COME SOON, but it will delay. But always it comes by the man God has. SEE, DAVID WANTED TO BUILD A TABERNACLE FOR HIM. GOD TOLD HIM, NO, THANK YOU. You are not the MAN I'VE ORDAINED. GOD HAD ANOINTED DAVID WITH ANOINTING OF WAR TO ANOINTING OF WAR. HE WAS A MAN OF WAR TO DESTROY THE ENEMIES OF ISRAEL TO EXPAND. BUT YOU SEE, THAT WAS HIS CALLING. THAT WAS HIS ASSIGNMENT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? DAVID WANTED TO OVERSTEP HIS ASSIGNMENT AND HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. WHEN GOD CALLS YOU, BETTER KNOW WHAT HE HAS ASSIGNED YOU TO DO. EVERY CHURCH HAS A VISION. IF YOU'RE A PASTOR, YOU MUST KNOW WHAT HAS GOD CALLED YOU. IF YOU'RE A MINISTER, IF YOU'RE AN EVANGELIST, [screaming] IF YOU'RE A PROPHET, YOU MUST KNOW WHAT IS MY ASSIGNMENT, God who SIGNS YOU UP, GIVES YOU AN ASSIGNMENT. GOD WHO CALLS YOU GIVES YOU [screaming] WHAT TO DO. IT MIGHT BE MARRIAGE. WHEN YOU'RE WALKING INTO A MARRIAGE, YOU MUST KNOW [screaming] THIS IS WHAT GOD WANTS YOU. WHY ARE YOU MARRYING THAT MAN? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ACCOMPLISH? SOME OF THEM ENTER INTO A MARRIAGE AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THIS MAN WANTS TO HAVE 12 CHILDREN. AND THEN YOU GET IN THERE AND FOR YOU WANT TO HAVE ONE. AND THE MAN SAYS, "I WANT TO say [panting] and THEN MARRIAGE BREAKS." SO YOU WALKED INTO THAT MARRIAGE WITHOUT KNOWING YOUR ASSIGNMENT. BROTHER, SISTER, WHEN YOU ARE QUOTING EACH OTHER, FIND OUT, ARE YOU MEANT FOR THAT MARRIAGE? FIND OUT [screaming] IS THIS ONE THE RIGHT ONE FOR ME. HOW DO YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW THEM BY THEIR CHARACTER. FIND THAT MAN'S CHARACTER. FIND THE WOMAN'S CHARACTER. WHAT IS HIS VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF HIS HOME? WHY YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT VISION? IF NOT, jump out. BUT PEOPLE JUST SAY, "HEY, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. YOU MAKE ME FEEL THINGS. WHEN I SEE YOU, I JUST FEEL A cry and then they get married and they realize the vision is different." You see, oh, THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS. GOD SAID, I'M TAKING YOU TO A LAND, A LAND [screaming] FLOWING. That was God's vision. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. AND TO A PLACE OF THE CANONITES, OF THE HITTITES, OF THE AMORITES, OF THE PERISITES, [screaming] THE JEITE. OH MY MY DON'T BE LIKE A ROCK ON YOUR HEEL IN YOUR LIFE. BE LIKE AN EAGLE FRIEND. SET YOURSELF FREE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; TO BRING THEM OUT OF EGYPT WAS THE VISION &gt;&gt; TO TAKE THEM TO CANON. THIS [screaming] LAND WAS NOT BARE LAND. God was taking THEM TO A LAND THAT WAS NOT FREE. THIS LAND WAS OCCUPIED [screaming] BY THE ENEMIES OF ISRAEL. BUT GOD HAD ANOINTED A MAN WITH A ANOINTING THAT REGARDLESS REGARDLESS IF THERE ARE PEOPLE [screaming] THERE. THIS MAN WAS ANOINTED WITH A VISION. WE MUST DRIVE EVERYONE. HALLELUJAH. THAT MEANS GOD ENVISIONED THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE OUT THE INHABITANTS [screaming] OF THE LAND SO THEY COULD POSSESS IT. THIS IS A TYPE OF THE VISION GOD HAS FOR THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH. TODAY THE TRUE CHURCH MUST POSSESS [screaming] EVERY REDEMPTIBLE OF GOD IN THIS HOUSE. WE MUST DRIVE OUT [screaming] OUR ENEMIES FROM OUR LAND FROM EVERY PROMISE OF THE WORD OF GOD. BUT LET ME TELL YOU SAINTS, GOD HAD ANOINTED A MAN. AMEN CALLED MOSES. HE WAS ANOINTED TO DRIVE OUT EVERY ENEMY, EVERYITE, EVERY EVIL, EVERYONE [screaming] OUT OF THEIR LIFE. BUT YOU SEE AS I WILL SHOW YOU SHORTLY, POLITICS CAME AND SUFFOCATED MOSES AND PUT MOSES IN A SITUATION WHERE [screaming] HE COULD NOT HELP THEM. Oh goodness. &gt;&gt; Listen church. GOD IN THIS HOUR HE HAS SENT US A MOSES. I SAID MOSES, THE PROPHET OF THIS HOUSE. HE'S ANOINTED. HIS MESSAGE IS ANOINTED. I don't know whether you HAVE EVER HEARD THIS. IT SAYS LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; As I sent JOHN as John for my first come, your message will my second coming. THE VISION IS IS coming and THE MISSION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A PROPHET. HE HAS TO FOR HIS MESSAGE TO FORAN. IF YOUR NEED IS COMING, JESUS IS COMING. RECEIVE THE PROPHETY'S MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? TODAY PEOPLE ANOINTED WITH A SPIRIT OF POLITICS. THEY ARE TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE PROPHET OF THIS HOUR. SAYING ELIJAH IS NOT COMING. THEY SAYING WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR. WE HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT. ANSWER ME THIS QUESTION. WHERE WAS THE HOLY SPIRIT WHEN GOD SENT MOSES? ARE YOU SAYING TO ME THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS NOT THERE YET? HE WAS THERE ENOUGH TO FILL JOHN IN THE WOMB. BUT HE [screaming] WAS NOT THERE WHEN GOD SAID, "I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM WITH A MIGHTY HAND." SO WHY DIDN'T HE SEND A SPIRIT COME OUT? GOD DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. HE HAD TO USE A MAN ON THE GROUND. AMEN. [screaming] AMEN. TO BRING A MESSAGE. A MESSAGE WAS SAYING COME OUT OF OUR LET ME PREACH TO YOU NOW. WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSENGER IN THIS GENERATION. OH, HELP ME PREACH SOMEBODY. WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSENGER WITH A MESSAGE. COME OUT OF MY PEOPLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF CATHOLICISM. COME OUT OF THE NATION. COME OUT OF PENTECOSTALISM. COME OUT OF ALL [screaming] IN LODGES. COME OUT. COME UP HIGHER. [screaming] HIGHER IN REVELATION. HIGHER IN THE RAPTURE AGE. COME OUT OF LADIA. COME IN THE BRIGHT [screaming] AGE. WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE. AMEN. AMEN. OH, GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S A RAPTURE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S A RAPTURE MESSAGE. ANYONE WHO SAYS GOD DID NOT SEND A PROPHET, WELL, you have COME TOO LATE. SOME PEOPLE here believe it. SOME PEOPLE HERE BELIEVE [screaming] IT. If you doubt it, don't you worry. The Holy Spirit will reveal it to you in a moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, LET ME GO HIGHER. THIS MESSAGE IS ANOINTED IS ANOINTED TO HELP YOU TO HELP ME DRIVE OUT OUR ENEMIES FROM OUR GOD-GIVEN PROMISES. BROTHER, WHENEVER YOU RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE, WHENEVER YOU HEAR THE WORD, YOU ARE GETTING ENERGY. YOU'RE BEING ENERGIZED TO DRIVE OUT YOUR ENEMIES OUT [screaming] OF YOUR HOME, OUT OF YOUR JOB, OUT OF YOUR LIFE OUT OF YOUR CHURCH, OUT OF YOUR SITUATION, OUT [screaming] OF YOUR LIFE, OUT OF YOUR EMOTIONS. YOU'RE DRIVING OUT YOUR ENEMIES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DOUBTS, ENEMIES OF DOUBTS, ENEMIES OF SICKNESS, ENEMIES OF POVERTY, ENEMIES OF SADNESS, ENEMIES. YOU KNOW THESE ARE OUR ENEMIES. WE ARE GIVEN THIS REDEMPTIVE RIGHT [screaming] BY THE WORD OF REDEMPTIVE TO KICK OUT OUR ENEMY. IF I WERE YOU RIGHT [screaming] NOW, I'LL BEGIN KICKING OUT MY ENEMY. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? If you WANT TO GET MARRIED AND IT'S NOT WORKING FAST, LET ME TELL YOU, IT'S YOUR REDEMPTIVE RIGHT. TO BE MARRIED, TO GET MARRIED. IF [screaming] YOU DESIRE IT, THEN GOD HAS SOMEONE SOMEWHERE FOR YOU. [screaming] But the PRINCE OF THE POWER OF THE AIR IS CATCHING IT. AND I'M HAVING A MESSAGE FOR YOU THIS MORNING. AMEN. WE HAVE RECEIVED A WORD. AMEN. WHICH WILL HELP YOU TO DRIVE OUT THAT ENEMY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, THIS IS NOT ONLY TO EXCITE US. THIS IS BEYOND EXCITEMENT. THIS IS NOT STIMULATION OF REVELATION. When revelation BUSTS IN YOUR MIND, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING CRAZY. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HOW MANY CAN FEEL IT, CHURCH? STIMULATION OF REVELATION. I'M JUST TRYING TO STIMULATE YOUR REVELATION. That is the vision. &gt;&gt; GO POSSESS YOUR ENEMIES. &gt;&gt; GO DRIVE OUT YOUR ENEMIES. TAKE YOUR LAND. [screaming] TAKE YOUR LAND. &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU HAVE AMEN. A NEED FOR A JOB. WE ARE WE HAVE AN OPEN BOOK. THE SEALS ARE OPEN, BROTHER. RECEIVE YOUR JOB. RECEIVE YOUR HUSBAND. [screaming] RECEIVE YOUR WIFE. RECEIVE YOUR JOB. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE WANT TO BE, you know, upgraded on their on their job. Promotion is not there. IT'S NOT WITH YOUR BOSS. PROMOTION IS RIGHT HERE. IF YOU WANT TO PASS EXAM, DON'T DO ANYTHING BAD. IT IS RIGHT HERE. YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY ANY BRIBES FOR ANYTHING. LISTEN. GET DEEPER WITH GOD. AMEN. YOU CAN RECEIVE YOUR PROMOTION RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; LET ME CHALLENGE YOU. &gt;&gt; I'M A PROPHET OF GOD RIGHT NOW. A NEW TESTAMENT PREACHER IS A PROPHET. IF YOU NEED A JOB, [screaming] I'M CHALLENGING YOU NOW TO BELIEVE FOR YOUR JOB. BELIEVE FOR YOUR JOB. I SAID BELIEVE FOR YOUR JOB IN THE NAME OF JESUS AND YOU [screaming] SHALL HAVE IT. OKAY. HOW MANY WANT PROMOTION? RECEIVE YOUR PROMOTION. &gt;&gt; RECEIVE YOUR PROMOTION. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WANT TO PASS EXAM? COME ON CHURCH. BEL RECEIVE IT &gt;&gt; AND IT SHALL HAPPEN. YOU KNOW THE WORD IS SPOKEN [screaming] AND IT MATERIALIZES. GOD THINKS IT DROPS DOWN INTO THE PREACHER'S MOUTH. IT BECOMES A WORD. BUT THEN IT MUST BE MANIFESTED. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE SAY HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You see that's the vision. You may be seated. Then a mission. Exodus 3:10, HE SAYS, "COME NOW, THEREFORE, AND I WILL SEND THEE UNTO PHARAOH." NOW HE'S GIVING HIM THE MISSION THAT THOU MAY SPRING FORTH MY PEOPLE, THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT. Exodus 7:16. AND THOU SHALT SAY UNTO HIM, THE LORD GOD OF HEBREWS HAS SENT me unto thee. That's why Bam says before you begin preaching, be sure God has called you. How on those sacred sons? If you don't know, if you don't know you are called, DON'T STEP ON THE PIT. WHY? BECAUSE IF YOU'RE CALLED, YOU EVEN know the duty, your job, your assignment. We are not looking for good quotes and good scriptures to read for people. BEFORE I BEGIN PREACHING, GOD HAS TOLD ME WHAT THAT SERVICE IS GOING TO ACCOMPLISH. SO, AS I'M PREACHING, THAT THING IS MATERIALIZING. BEFORE MOSES WENT, GOD HAD TOLD HIM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO. HE KNEW IT. AND HE KNEW WHEN HE SAYS, "LET [screaming] MY PEOPLE GO." HE knew the people will GO because it's not his word. He did not go to theology or started to get a good word to speak. That's why preaching must be by inspiration. THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME IN THE WILDERNESS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And here too that thou would not hear. Now when God sends a man, he has prepared him and given him a message. Many people are running aimlessly without any message. Do you know the story of Akmas? One time Abselum went against his father. his father David. &gt;&gt; And uh you know David had a a a captain CALLED JOB. JOB WAS THE CAPTAIN OF THE HORSE. AND uh you know you know uh the king told uh the THE JOB GO OUT [screaming] TRY TO KILL THAT UH REBELLION but make sure my son Abselum is not killed. Don't touch him. But go and make sure they stop that kind of thing. AND SO HE WENT AND AS THEY WERE FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING, [screaming] YOU KNOW. UH THEN ABSELUM WAS ON A HORSE TAKING OFF AND THEN THEY REACHED SOMEWHERE AND THE HORSE WENT STRAIGHT FOR a tree. AND THIS TREE HAD A VE AND THE HEAD OF ABSELUM WAS squeezed there. HELP ME SOMEBODY HELP ME. SOMEBODY HELP ME. SOMEBODY HELP ME. AND THEN JOB CAME AND YOU KNOW WHAT? BEING A SOLDIER THAT HE WAS AND KNOWING HOW MUCH TROUBLE THIS MAN HAD CAUSED HIS LIFE WAS TAKEN. And then you know uh IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF COMMOTION AND THINGS [screaming] AND PEOPLE everybody shouting heard the noise. He quickly RAN TO JOAB AND TOLD HIM, "JO, CAPTAIN, PLEASE LET ME GO TO THE KING. LET ME TELL HIM THE NEWS." AND HE SAID, "YOU TELL HIM, LET ME TELL HIM WHAT I HAVE HEARD. I HEARD A lot of noise and commotion." He told him, "You can't go. You will go another day. TO THIS DAY you cannot go because you DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE TO GO TO TELL THE KING BUT I MUST say my my captain PLEASE GIVE ME THIS CHANCE LET ME GO GIVE ME ALSO DELIVER THE the king some news he SAID OKAY SINCE YOU HAVE INSISTED YOU CAN go and called Kushi. &gt;&gt; Kushi was THERE THE WHOLE TIME. &gt;&gt; HE SAW EVERYTHING AND HE TELLS KUSHI, &gt;&gt; "You've seen everything, &gt;&gt; yes, you've heard everything. &gt;&gt; Yes. go and tell the king what you have seen and heard and started running and was not just RUNNING TAKING OFF AND HE NOT EVEN USE THE MAIN ROAD. He used a shortcut. SO BEFORE KUSHI [screaming] ARRIVED, had already arrived AND THE THE SOLDIERS IN THE BALCONY. SO I WAS RUNNING AND THE KING SAW SOMEONE RUNNING. AND THEY SAID, "HEY, they said this running who is that one?" But the running is like the running of Akmas. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, Don't run like arguments without an assignment. I HAVE ZEAL. WAIT UNTIL GOD ASSIGNED HIM. And he ran and he ran and he arrived and the king. He said, "I want to see the king. I WANT TO SEE THE KING. He must have had crossed legs because he's like that of Akmas. And when he arrived sas was received by the king and the king told him because the king was testing tell me what happened MY SON. HE SAID, "OKAY, LONG LIVE THE KING. Long live the king. What is it? My son, YOU ARE THE BEST." HE JUST WANTED TO BE IN the presence of the king. He didn't have a message. Oh king, A MESSAGE, I TOLD YOU. THERE WAS A LOT OF NOISE AS THEY WERE SHOUTING. I HEARD ANOTHER NOISE AND THE KING IS WAITING FOR the king. SO AND AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN [screaming] I MUST TALK AND THEN SHOUTING STAND ON THE SIDE BE QUIET. [screaming] THE KING ORDERED him said, "You have no message today." And as SOON AS THAT HAPPENED, SHE ARRIVED. Long live the king. I'm here to I'm here to bring tith. But I'm sorry the son is dead. THE KING BROKE DOWN. IF you are HAVING AN ASSIGNMENT, YOU WILL BRING A message that will break people's hearts to receive Christ. Cuz our hearts are hard. I tell you, IT TAKES GOD. IT TAKES AN ANOINTING. IT TAKES A CALLING AND THE GRACE of God upon someone. See friends, One, many people are running aimlessly LIKE I WAS WITHOUT ANY MESSAGE. BUT GOD AT EVERY JUNCTION OF TIME, he will send a cushy ANOINTED WITH A WORD OF DELIVERANCE TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT the vision. Now, I want you to listen to a few quotes I'm going to quote for you. In the discernment of the spirit, the prophet says, "A New Testament prophet is a preacher." The New Testament prophet is a preacher. We all KNOW THAT JUST ANY MINISTER THAT'S A PREACHER IS A PROPHET. AMEN. PRAY FOR HIM. We still have about 20 more minutes. AMEN. A NEW TESTAMENT PROPHET IF HE'S PROPHESYING, PREACHING, NOT TO TRY TO EDIFY HIMSELF, to make a BIG NAME OR TO EDIFY HIS ORGANIZATION. AMEN. He should be where he SHOULD BE IN AN ORGANIZATION. HERE I AM WITHOUT ONE. But yet preaching, YOU SHOULD BE YOU should be part of. THAT'S RIGHT. EVERY MAN OUGHT TO HAVE A CHURCH HOME. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A PLACE NOT JUST TO FLOAT FROM PETER TO POP. TODAY YOU ARE HERE. NEXT WEEK YOU WERE THERE. THE OTHER WEEK YOU WERE THERE. THE OTHER WEEK YOU WERE THE OTHER SIDE. SO WHAT IS YOUR CHURCH? WHO IS YOUR PASTOR? YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE [screaming] A BLESS NOT JUST TO FLOAT FROM A BAD PERIOD OF PASS. SOMEWHERE YOU PAY YOUR TITHES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOMEWHERE YOU YOU YOU PAY YOUR TITHES. SOMEWHERE THAT YOU HELP SUPPORT THE CAUSE. WE ARE COMING TO THAT. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE CAUSE? IT MEANS A MINISTRY OR A PART OF MUST HAVE A CAUSE MUST HAVE A VISION MUST HAVE SOMETHING THAT DRIVES THEM. WHAT I'VE SEEN IN MANY OF OUR CHURCHES LET ME NOT PUT IT THAT WAY UNDERSTOOD WHAT I'VE SEEN AMONG MANY BELIEVERS OF THIS MESSAGE. WE DON'T HAVE A CAUSE. WE ARE JUST RUNNING AIMLESS. WE'RE JUST PREACHING AND PREACHING AND PREACHING AND OTHER PEOPLE'S CAUSE IS JUST TO PREACH LAWS AND LOSS AND LAWS. Don't don't. AND THEN YOU WONDER WHAT'S THE CAUSE? WHAT'S THE VISION? WHAT'S THE ASSIGNMENT THAT WE AS A BODY OF BELIEVERS HAVE? AMEN. IF WE'RE PART OF A CHURCH, YOU MUST HAVE A CAUSE. AMEN. THAT THEY KNOW EVEN YOU GO [screaming] TO ANOTHER PLACE TO PREACH. YOU ARE WITHIN that same vision. &gt;&gt; YOU SUPPORT THE CAUSE. YOU HAVE TO [screaming] HAVE A CHURCH HOME. EVERY BELIEVER SHOULD WHERE THEY SUPPORT THE CAUSE. YOUR CHOICE. And I've put that in big capital letters. TAKE YOUR CHOICE. YOU SEE, YOU DON'T YOU CANNOT BE FORCED INTO A CHURCH. That's why you have TO TAKE A CHOICE BECAUSE REMEMBER YOU HAVE to believe in the cause of the church. BUT THEN DON'T NEVER DYSFELLOWSHIP THE [screaming] OTHER MAN BECAUSE HE DON'T BELONG TO YOUR GROUP. DISERN SPIRIT AND SEE IF HE'S GOT THE SAME PURPOSE IN HEART. Then you go TO FELLOWSHIP ONE WITH HIM. YOU ARE WORKING FOR ONE GREAT CAUSE. THAT'S THE CAUSE OF CHRIST. I think that's absolutely true. Now I want to TELL YOU CHURCH. GOD ALWAYS SENDS A PROPHET TO RUN WITH A VISION. If you preach or rather if you read a message Christ is the mystery of God revealed the cause of this hour, the cause, the vision. A New Testament preacher IS A PROPHET. EVERY BELIEVER SHOULD ACCEPT HEADSHIP. IN THIS MANNER. [screaming] YOU KNOW, YOU MUST HAVE A PROPHET TO GUIDE YOU. AMEN. IN YOUR LITTLE WORLD, IN YOUR LITTLE PLACE, WHEREVER YOU ARE, I'VE I've seen people who say, "Well, me, I'M AN EVANGELIST. I WORLD OVER, but they have no pastor. They don't pay tither anywhere. WATCH TELEVISION. ALL MONEY YOU PAY IN TAXES IS NOT TO ENRICH ME. IT IS TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE WE AS A CHURCH ARE STANDING FOR YOUR OBLIGATION AS A MEMBER OF THE BODY TO SUPPORT THAT VISION BY PAYING YOUR TITHING. THAT'S WHY GOD SAID IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR TITH YOU ARE A ROBBER. YOU'RE MAKING THE WORK OF GOD DIFFICULT. YOU'RE DEFEATING [screaming] THE CAUSE. YOU'RE MAKING US LAG BEHIND. EVERY CHRISTIAN MUST SPARE THEIR TITLES, including the pastor. Praise God. Every believer, you know, well, I'll not go there. EVERY BELIEVER SHOULD ACCEPT HEADSHIP IN THIS. IT IS A PROGRAM OF GOD. THE SPIRITUAL HEADSHIP YOU ARE UNDER MUST HAVE A VISION. IT MUST HAVE A CAUSE. IT MUST HAVE A MANDATE. YES, I UNDERSTAND ALL PREACHERS ARE SERVANTS OF GOD. BUT WHAT IS THE CAUSE? THE ASSIGNMENT GOD HAS PLACED IN THE HEART of a man of God, of a pastor. you have submitted yourself to what is that mandate he has before YOU MAKE A CHOICE THAT SHOULD BE THE MOTIVATION I saw the man that mentored me in this message you No, he accomplished a lot in his lifetime. Built a large church, beautiful building in the 80s, beautiful building even to the present day. But if they tell you the history, it was not easy. But the people believed in his vision, STOOD BEHIND IT. SUPPORTED THAT WORK WITH ONE HEART BECAUSE they saw his money. He's built a school have a large campground acres and acres. This was not done in one year, TWO YEARS, THREE YEARS, MANY YEARS OF A COMMITTED MAN and people that supported that vision. THAT'S HOW GOD WORKS. But what was his vision? And I'm glad his vision I realized many years ago. I made it my vision. HIS VISION WAS TO SEND THIS MESSAGE TO EVERY TRIBE TO EVERY TOWN AND WHOEVER CAN LET THEM. WHY? If you believe THIS IS A WORD OF GOD FOR THIS DAY, THEN OUR generation needs. &gt;&gt; And then when PEOPLE PAY THEIR TITHES, and I can tell you DVF, &gt;&gt; WHENEVER YOU PAY YOUR TITHE, YOU CAN BE 100% SURE almost more than 100 of what you GAIN goes to the work of God, goes to support that view. Amen. &gt;&gt; God doesn't want mixers. HE WANTS SEPARATE. SEPARATE ME PAUL and and and Barnabas. Separate yourself from the things OF GOD. GOD HAVE MERCY. GIVE US SOME OLD TIME PREACHERS THAT WILL PREACH THE GOSPEL. CALL BLACK AND WHITE WHITE. and lay the gospel WHERE IT WILL. AS JOHN THE BAPTIST SAID, THE AX IS LAID to the root of THE TREE. GIVE US MORE PREACHERS LIKE THAT. WE WILL GET BACK TO GOD'S WAY ABOUT THINGS. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT FRIENDS. AMEN. EVEN IN THIS CHURCH, MAY GOD RAISE PREACHERS THAT WILL CALL BLACK WHITE AND WILL PREACH THE WORD WITHOUT SUFFERING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT. THEY DON'T fear to make anybody angry. IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE INSPIRED, LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT HERE. I HAVE NEVER PREACHED ANYTHING HERE BEHIND THE PULL pit because I know someone's experiencing. If I KNOW YOU'RE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING, I will never preach about it. I will WAIT IN THE FUTURE. GOD GIVES ME ANOINTING FOR IT. BUT BEFORE THEN I CANNOT. WHY? BECAUSE THEN THAT WILL BE CANO. YOU SEE I HAVE TO PREACH INSPIRATION. I'M TELLING YOU CHURCH. IF YOU EVER HEAR ME PREACHING ANYTHING AND YOUR FEAR IS EXPOSING YOU, THAT IS BECAUSE GOD HIMSELF HAS DESIGNED YOUR HEART. I may not EVEN REMEMBER WHAT HE TOLD ME. I'M JUST PREACHING MY HEART BECAUSE IT'S AN assignment God has given and in questions and answers HE SAYS WE BELIEVE IN CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT IS ORDERED OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE BIBLE. THE PASTOR IS ALWAYS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. THE PASTOR IS ALWAYS THAT IS God is elder. IN ORGANIZATIONS YOU HAVE TO COME THROUGH THE BISHOP. THERE IS NO HIGHER [screaming] ORDER IN THE BIBLE THAN THE ELDER OF THE CHURCH. Just tell ME WHERE IT'S AT. THERE'S NO HIGHER ORDER IN THE BIBLE FOR THE CHURCH THAN THE elder which is the pastor. HE'S THE HIGHEST ORDER OF THE BIBLE. Now don't receive any accusation against your elder. No brother, don't receive any accusation. Find the word for accusation UNLESS IT IT FIRST BE BY TWO OR THREE WITNESSES. WELL, you can call it. NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS ABOUT, this is no way talking ABOUT ME. SOMEBODY SEE AS A CHILD. DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT UNTIL YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE WITNESSES? WHY WOULD [screaming] GOD SAY THIS? BECAUSE IF THE PASTOR IS STRUCK, THE WHOLE FLOCK WILL FEEL IT. IF ONE MAN BEGINS TO RUN OUT WITH A LOT OF GOSSIP ABOUT THE REVIVAL WILL DIE. PEOPLE'S HEARTS WILL BE WILL BE LIKE STONE. THE PASTOR CAN NO LONGER HELP THEM. WE HAVE SO MANY CHURCHES LIKE THAT WHERE THE PASTOR CANNOT EVEN PREACH ANYTHING AND PEOPLE RECEIVE IT BECAUSE OF SO MUCH GOSSIP IN THE CHURCH. SO THEN GOD HAS A STANDARD. SOMEONE COMES WITH GOSSIP BECAUSE GOD IS PROTECTING THE VISION. HE SAYS, "DON'T YOU RECEIVE IT. DON'T [screaming] YOU RECEIVE IT? BUT IF YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A CHANCE HAVE TWO WITNESSES, HAVE THREE WITNESSES. AND THESE ONES MUST FIRST BE PROVED." WHY IS GOD DOING THAT? IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MAN. IT'S ABOUT THE OFFICE. THE OFFICE IS A CUSTODIAN OF THE VISION. WHEN ANYONE GOES AGAINST THE PASTOR OF ANY CHURCH, LET ME TELL YOU THAT PERSON, THAT PERSON IS ANOINTED BY THE DEVIL TO DESTROY THE VISION. IF YOU EVER FEEL AT ANY TIME AND I KNOW WE HAVE SOME VISITORS HERE AND PROBABLY SOME OTHER PEOPLE STREAMING, WE HEAR FROM THEM FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. SO THIS IS NOT ONLY FOR YOU. SOMETIMES IF YOU EVER FEEL YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR PASTOR, YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED. LET ME TELL YOU, FIND ANOTHER CHURCH. BUT DON'T YOU [screaming] EVER CAUSE TROUBLE IN A LOCAL BODY OF BELIEVERS BECAUSE GOD WILL HOLD [screaming] YOU RESPONSIBLE AND LET THEM WITNESSES BE TRIED FAST. AND THEN IF THAT ELDER HAS DONE SOMETHING WRONG, THEN THESE THREE HOLY GHOST WITNESSES HAS BEEN TRIED AND PROVEN THAT THEY'VE REALLY DONE SOMETHING TO THE ELDER, then go to the elder and that sin openly rebuke so that others may see and take heed way. YOU CANNOT LIVE ANY HIGHER THAN YOUR PASTOR. HE says &gt;&gt; how the angel came to me. &gt;&gt; All right. Please brothers give me a few moments. I need to conclude this IN ONE SERMON. NOW I BELIEVE MOSTLY MOSTLY TO BLAME and not to blame but mostly is the way the people are taught AND THE CHURCH WILL NEVER LIVE HIGHER [screaming] THAN ITS PASTOR TEACHES. You seldom FIND THAT. IF YOU GOT A GOOD SOUND, SAINT GOSPEL TEACHER, YOU WILL USUALLY FIND THAT TYPE OF CHURCH, you will usually FIND IT. AND IT'S JUST WHERE YOUR pastor leads you, the pastor that feeds you. You see, whatever your PASTOR FEEDS YOU WILL BE YOUR MAKEUP. IF HE'S THE KIND THAT IS THE GUY THAT RUNS DOWN EVERYONE AND DISRESPECTS EVERYONE, you will find that spirit on the people's feet. That's why brother Bham says pastor, sorry, churches carry spirits. That's why you should not just go to every church. Churches carry spirits. Before you try to go to a church, even when you travel somewhere in a town or in a distance in a country, text your pastor, call him, ask, "Do we have a church around?" DON'T ASK FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. FIND about your what you're going TO FEED ON. BECAUSE YOU SEE, YOU GO IN A CHURCH one time, YOU FIND THE PASTOR has this critical SPIRIT ON HIM. CRITICAL CRITICAL critical critical CRITICIZING talking bad about my other pastor. FIND THE PEOPLE ARE THE SAME WAY SAME SAME WAY THEY TALK AGAINST MEN OF GOD EVEN ON WHATSAPP THEY DON'T RESPECT MEN OF GOD BEFORE I COMMENT I ALWAYS look at that person where does he go to church then I'm surprised YOU GET THE ISSUE THIS IS WHAT IT IS BROTHER IS TELLING YOU CANNOT LIVE ANY HIGHER THAN YOUR PASTOR. HOW HE FEEDS YOU, HOW HE takes the word seriously, YOU WILL TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. IF HE MISINTERPRETS THE WORD, YOU WILL INTER M. SO IT IS IMPORTANT WHO FITS YOU. [cheering] In Christ is the myster of God revealed. HE SAYS LOVE ONE ANOTHER ABOVE EVERYTHING. Love one another. Don't don't no matter WHAT THE DEVIL TRIES TO SAY, YOU ARE NOW GOING TO GET BIG SWEET GROUP. BUT REMEMBER MY WARNING. S WON'T LET THAT STAY THAT WAY. HE WILL SHOOT EVERYTHING. IF HE HAS TO BRING SOMEONE TO MAKE THAT TARGET, HE WILL BRING some critical OR he will sit him down and he cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness AND THINGS. THEN HE WILL SHOOT THAT GUY WITH SOME KIND OF POISON STUFF AND THAT GUY WILL RUN AND START THROWING THE CHURCH WITH HIM. Are you not seeing these days? The pastor has a problem. Give me the ministry things are sick. What do you see? &gt;&gt; Yes. Brother Wa told me the church is sick. These people are short have a shot from the death. See the prophet told us amen well if you don't have that spirit you will be saying amen and rejoicing. &gt;&gt; And if you have it say amen and let it go what without some kind of stuff and you will start you know don't you take s with it. Don't you have NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING ELSE. YOU STAY RIGHT LOVING AND SWEET AND KIND TO ONE ANOTHER. PRAY FOR THAT MAN THAT HE WILL BE SAVED TOO, THAT woman or WHOEVER IT IS. PRAY FOR THEM TO AND STICK ONE WITH ANOTHER AND STAY WITH YOUR PASTOR. HE IS THE SHEPHERD AND YOU GIVE HIM RESPECT. HE WILL LEAD YOU THROUGH. [screaming] HE WILL LEAD YOU THROUGH because he's ordained OF GOD TO DO SO. NOW, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THE ENEMY WILL COME AND WHEN HE DOES CLING THAT MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER AND THE ONE THAT THE DEVIL IS USING [screaming] FOR HIS ENEMY WILL EITHER GET OUT OR HE WILL COME IN AND BE ONE OF YOU. THAT'S ALL. DON'T NEVER TALK. MAKE YOURSELF win the poor. WIN the win. We the JOTH [screaming] they don't LIKE US THEY SEPARATE WITH THE BLACK WITH THE BROWN WITH THE TOMBLING at a moment LIKE THIS STAND THERE AND LISTEN we who are like this we should never claim WE SHOULD BE ONE BIG STREET GROUP ALL THE TIME. [screaming] ALL RIGHT. NOW I'M COMING TO THE SERMON OF TODAY so I can close it. NOW AS THEY WERE GOING IN THE JOURNEY, OH MY MY COMES A BROTHER, THE SON OF IS AND THE BIBLE SAY THEY TOOK MEN AND THEY ROSE UP BEFORE MOSES WITH SOME CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, 250 PRINCES, &gt;&gt; prince Prince, [screaming] famous in the congregation, MEN ARE RENOWN. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF POLITICAL MANEUVERS. WHEN YOU WANT THE CHURCH TO FALL, ENTERTAIN POLITICAL MANEUVERS. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL GO AROUND THE CHURCH WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RESPECTED RESPECTABLE MEN OR WOMEN THEMSELVES. But then they BEGIN TO GO AROUND. THEY DON'T GO TO ANYBODY. THEY GO TO THOSE ONES WHO THEY KNOW THEY PAY BIG TES. THEY GO TO THOSE ONES WHO THEY KNOW ARE EDUCATED. THEY GO TO THOSE ONES WHO THEY KNOW CAN CAUSE A REVOLT. AND THEY CALLED 250 NOT COMMON MEN BUT PRINCES men of reor and they GATHERED THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAINST MOSES AND against Aaron. They said unto them, you take too much UPON YOURSELF, SEEING [screaming] ALL THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY. EVERY ONE OF THEM AND THE LORD IS AMONG THEM. WHEREFORE THEN LIFT YOU UP YOURSELVES ABOVE THE CONGRE. And when MOSES HAD IT, HE FELL UPON HIS FACE. THIS IS A MAN WHO HIDE FROM GOD [screaming] THE VISION OF THE HOLY GH people who are only led or moved by political maneuvers. HE FELL UPON HIS FACE. AND HE SPAKE UNTO KORA, NOT STANDING, BUT FALLING DOWN and unto all his company, SAYING EVEN TOMORROW. THE LORD WILL [screaming] SHOW WHO ARE HIS AND WHO IS HOLY AND WILL CAUSE HIM TO COME NEAR UNTO HIM. Even him WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN WILL HE CAUSE TO COME NEAR UNTO HIM. YOU KNOW ABOUT ONE THING ABOUT A MAN OF GOD OR A WOMAN OF GOD. IF GOD CALLED YOU AND ONE RISES UP AGAINST YOU NEVER FIGHT THEM. NEVER ANSWER THEM. LET [screaming] GOD THE ONE WHO CALLED YOU FIGHT FOR YOU. ANSWER [screaming] FOR YOU. THAT'S THE characterism of a man that is called by God. this do. &gt;&gt; All right. And then and and and he says and put incense in them. Take take you know sensors and put incense in them. Sensors and put in them and before the Lord tomorrow and it shall be that the man whom the Lord does choose, he shall be holy. You take too much upon you. No, he's also telling them you take too much upon you. You sons of Levy. They were sons of Levy. But they were not priests. And he's telling them, you've taken too much upon him. THE THING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BEYOND your level. So let God prove. And Moses SAID UNTO KORA, "HERE I PRAY YOU, sons of Levi," she may fit but a small thing unto you, THAT GOD of Israel has separated you from the congregation of ISRAEL to bring you near to himself to yourself, the tabernacle of the Lord to stand before the congregation to minister to them. Do not despise the office God HAS PLACED YOU IN. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, quickly pray and find one. You need to FIND WHERE YOU BELONG HOW YOU SUPPORT THE CAUSE. Can I have a resounding amen on that? You see, he says, "And he has brought near unto him." Please church, just pardon me. Give me grace. Let me finish. See, but a small thing unto you. Okay. All right. I finish that now. says, "And he has brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren, the sons of Levi with thee, seek ye the priesthood also, for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the law. And what is Aaron?" The imam against him. And Moses sent to call and Abraham the son OF HE SAID, "BRING THEM TO ME HERE." AND THEY SAID, "We will not go. PASTOR IS CALLING US, we will not go." And he said, "IS IT A SMALL THING THAT THOU HAS BROUGHT US OUT OF THE LAND THAT FLOWTH WITH MILK AND HONEY?" This is their complaint. TO KILL US IN THE WILDERNESS EXCEPT you you have already only made thyself altogether a prince over us. MOREOVER, THOU HAS NOT BROUGHT US INTO A LAND THAT FLOWTH MILK AND HONEY. NOT GIVEN US INHERITANCE OF THE FIELD AND VENIENT. Will thou put out THE EYES OF THIS MAN? WILL YOU PUT OUT THEIR eyes if you don't come? If we don't come, he had called them. We will not come. If we don't come, will you remove our eyes? We will not come. You can imagine such contempt. AND MOSES WAS VERY RO AND HE SAID UNTO THE LORD GO [screaming] RESPECT NOT THOU THEIR OFFERING. When I read that I said so the prayers of our pastor matter don't ever put a man of God in any situation to pray such a prayer on you. I'm telling you, I have not taken one us from them. May have hurt one of them unto be thou and all like company before the Lord that they said unto Mora and take every All right, let me just go down because of time verses 20. And the Lord came down of course and he spake unto Moses and unto Aaron SAYING yourselves from among the congregation that I may consume them in a moment. You see HOW GOD WAS ANGRY. He wanted to KILL THESE PEOPLE in a moment. But you see, Moses had a heart of a he said, "No, God, don't do it. Don't do it. God didn't do it." But he did it. If God makes up his mind to do something, They didn't die in a moment, but they died over a period of time. Only their children made it to the promised land. Vers 30, I'm reaching the climax now. But if the Lord make a new thing and the earth open, mouth and swallow them up with all that pertainth unto them. And they go down quick INTO THE PIT. THEN YOU SHALL UNDERSTAND [screaming] THAT THESE MEN ARE provoked the Lord. And it came to pass as he had made an end OF THE SPEAKING OF THIS WORD THAT THE GROUND CLEVER that was under them. And the earth opened that mouth swallowed them and the HOUSES AND ALL THE MEN THAT PERTAIN UNTO KORA AND ALL THEIR AND ALL THAT PERTAIN TO THEM. THEY WENT DOWN ALIVE INTO THE PIT, and their eyes closed upon, AND THEY PERISHED AMONG THE CANADIANS. [screaming] And all Israel THAT WERE AROUND ABOUT THEM FLED the cry of them. They say, "Lest the earth swallow us upwards." AND I CAME OUT OF FIRE FROM THE LORD. I CONSUMED THE 250 MEN THAT OFFERED IN Abraham try to do political maneuvers in the congregation. THEY SOUGHT FOR POWER INSTEAD OF A mission or mandate from the Lord. See how the people perished. See how the Lord stopped moving them into the direction of fulfilling the word. these people CONTINUED CIRCLING IN THE DESERT FOR YEARS. ALL BECAUSE OF MEN ANOINTED BY SATAN that obscur their vision by political maneuvers them lose focus on the vision. God has given us a vision. We should stay the course. Brother Bam then goes ahead. I'm not quoted because of time in a Theian church age. You can go and read it in the church age book. talks about Jezebel and how you know should you know how I have married Jezebel and he did some political maneuvers to strengthen his kingdom and secure it and that's exactly what the church did under Emperor Constantine Constantin THEY UNITED THEY FORMED THE COUNCIL THAT'S WHAT THE CHURCH HAS DONE TODAY. YOU SEE THE KINDS OF CHURCHES. IT'S A POLITICAL MANEUVER. God is not in it. That's why we are not part of any denomination. That's how we HAVE HEARD A MESSAGE. COME OUT [screaming] OF MY PEOPLE BE NOT PARTAKERS OF OUR SINS. AND WE ARE OUT OF the we are not going to be a part of it. God is calling a bride. Prepare her for the coming king. But where are you? Which side are you on as the musicians come please? It was con conser idea to get everyone together pagans and nominal Christians and true Christians. And for a while it looked like it WOULD BE SUCCEED. BUT THE REAL BELIEVERS CAME ALONG TO SEE if they could bring back the ones that had drifted away from them. But when they saw THAT THEY COULDN'T BRING THEM BACK INTO THE TRUTH, they were forced to break away from the body political. Then when they did, they were called heretics and they were persecuted. Let me say this right here that we have the very same thing going on right now. The people are all coming together. They are writing a Bible that will suit everyone whether it is a be a Jew or Catholic or Protestant. I say they have already written it. They have their own SIN COUNCIL BUT THEY CALL IT the ecumenical council. begin to pray softly and do you know whom all these organizations FIGHT THEY FIGHT THE TRUE PENTECOSTALS I don't mean the organization CALLED PENTECOSTALS I MEAN THE ONES WHO ARE PENTECOSTAL BECAUSE THEY ARE FILLED WITH THE HOLY [screaming] GHOST AND THEY HAVE SIGNS AND GIFT IN THEIR midst because they WALK IN TRUTH JEZEBEL SPIRIT IS STILL HUNTING US TODAY. BROTHER, let's keep our eyes on the vision. We did not come TO PLAY. We are human beings filled with a lot of insufficiencies both you and I. But you know what? Each of us has a different assignment in the body of Christ. Find your mission. Find your assignment. CATCH THE VISION AND AS ONE BODY. LET'S CARRY ON. LET'S PUSH FORWARD. WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO IN OUR GENERATION, LET'S DO IT. LET ME TELL YOU FRIENDS, I AM DETERMINED.

Are you among those that ran out from among those and said, "We don't want to be swallowed up. Where are you? Who are you? What are you doing in this place? If God has planted you even in this little ministry called me, just a little bit of of what God is doing all over, but he has planted you here for a purpose. I've never invited any of you. But God knew that you would be here and he has planted you here. for a purpose. What would you have him do for you? What would you have him do for you?

But uh so I'm sorry if they've not announced it yet. So but uh you know we we as a church should plan to be there and if you can make it that will be a blessing and our youth camp. This is the last month December. So let's register. Um [music] I saw we've printed some things but those codes I saw brother Isaac they lost. You cannot rescan them anymore. So what we are going to do I think we'll reactivate them but uh you need to [music] put for the people the website here. Do you have the website? Can you don't have internet? Where is brother? Can you come and put internet here so we can reject the website so we can show the people how to let him sing a song one song as brother Isaac comes to work on this. I want to show you how to register right on the screen. It is very easy.
