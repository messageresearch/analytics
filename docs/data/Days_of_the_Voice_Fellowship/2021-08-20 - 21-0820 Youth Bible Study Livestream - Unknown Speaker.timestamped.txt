[35:49] of our lord jesus
[35:51] um i thought the girls were not going to
[35:53] show up
[35:54] so i thought you gave up the bible study
[35:57] you know because
[35:59] we understand that if anyone will miss
[36:01] twice they'll not be allowed admittedly
[36:03] again
[36:04] i hope you got the information
[36:07] okay so you should be very very serious
[36:09] and then the next time if trainable
[36:11] doesn't read they will also not be
[36:12] admitted so
[36:15] how may i finish the pokemon church age
[36:17] raise up your hand
[36:22] okay
[36:24] sister doctors
[36:26] which play are you on
[36:31] you're about to finish it
[36:33] so if anyone is below sister doctors
[36:36] it means you you are
[36:38] not serious
[36:39] taking this serious
[36:44] you should really
[36:46] be very serious with reading
[36:48] so that when we come you can be able to
[36:50] ask questions
[36:52] which will lead you to understand
[36:54] and
[36:55] for
[36:57] uh
[36:58] be able to discuss
[37:00] with us
[37:01] and give us some good nuggets which can
[37:03] be a blessing
[37:05] praise
[37:08] so um
[37:10] who has something substantial that you'd
[37:12] like to share with us
[37:14] as we start
[37:15] our program today from the programming
[37:18] church age
[37:20] well can i go one by one
[37:22] but i realize if i go
[37:24] one by one
[37:25] sometimes we we take three
[37:28] services three days
[37:31] to finish a church a chapter so
[37:34] uh but idealize also when i ask you
[37:37] to volunteer yourself and this and
[37:39] discuss with us what you have read no
[37:41] one does
[37:42] or if you do so i don't know which
[37:45] strategy we are going to use to
[37:48] involve everybody
[37:50] vertical yes have you finished the chat
[37:52] if affirmative
[37:56] you're about to finish it yes
[37:58] what is it that your already shocked you
[38:01] more
[38:02] almost
[38:04] from the figurement age
[38:11] you see
[38:24] what does it say
[38:40] 81.
[38:58] the prophet said here
[39:01] there was
[39:02] there was an original church and the
[39:04] future was good
[39:07] but
[39:09] uh it talked about nimrod and actually
[39:12] and
[39:26] of
[39:27] because when we see what they did
[39:30] what is it where did the
[39:32] lineage of harm come from
[39:40] okay yes uh my main emphasis is going to
[39:44] be emerald
[39:48] nimrod
[39:50] i think it was actually
[39:53] we had three targets in his life
[39:58] nimrod's first target was to make
[40:00] himself known and popular and a mighty
[40:02] mind
[40:03] his second target was to was to make his
[40:06] own religion
[40:08] and the third target was to
[40:12] to build a great city
[40:15] and
[40:16] when you look at numerous targets
[40:19] they are not really good
[40:22] because when we look at making himself
[40:24] popular
[40:27] the way he was going to make himself
[40:28] popular was really not
[40:30] it was not the right way
[40:32] because how would make himself popular
[40:34] was quick by creating a religion
[40:37] uh this is where the trinity came in
[40:40] he had a prophet say that trinity
[40:44] it's the first thing which came into the
[40:46] church to
[40:47] to spoil it and do everything
[40:50] it started with trinity anyway
[40:53] it says
[40:55] that
[40:56] polytheistic religion
[40:58] of the enemy began with a humanitarian
[41:02] doctrine
[41:03] where we all know trinity we believe in
[41:06] three goods
[41:07] some people believe that
[41:10] one good
[41:11] one good but in three minds something
[41:14] like that
[41:15] it explains somewhere about what people
[41:17] think about
[41:19] trinity
[41:21] but this interim doctrine is really not
[41:23] right
[41:25] actually
[41:26] i believe nicknamed
[41:29] uh foreign
[41:34] whereby
[41:35] it is not you because there is only one
[41:38] god
[41:42] i believe we all know trinity
[41:46] that's why for sure the prophet
[41:48] emphasizes and god has got it with it
[41:50] because even up to today
[41:52] actually i read some might say that it
[41:54] says that
[41:55] let me look for that line but it says
[41:57] that
[41:59] uh
[42:00] that people will they will keep on being
[42:03] lied to until jesus comes about you
[42:06] i didn't think of three goods until
[42:08] jesus comes back
[42:10] that's why for when i first read
[42:13] i was wondering i said for sure
[42:20] i was saying for sure that
[42:23] these things of long trility was
[42:25] overwhelming
[42:27] but here it really showed you that it
[42:29] will be there until you just come back
[42:33] yes so that's that's my mind
[42:36] and also about
[42:38] uh
[42:40] the trinity uh the trinity
[42:43] which the first trinity
[42:45] it was about
[42:47] i think
[42:48] nimrod's wife
[42:50] and the sun
[42:54] when nimrod died that's how they
[42:57] in it to be
[42:58] and so they would worship
[43:01] the mother
[43:02] and the son that is that is that is
[43:06] wife
[43:07] and i think maybe that child
[43:09] but the most surprising thing here
[43:11] the sun
[43:13] here is also your husband or your mother
[43:20] yeah and it explains so much and very
[43:23] many things about things
[43:29] is a very wrong doctrine and it didn't
[43:32] just start to recent
[43:34] it started sometime back
[43:36] actually when the two jews when they
[43:37] took the message to rome
[43:40] they were just away
[43:42] they were sent away and a few remains
[43:45] there
[43:45] were not strong in faith and they
[43:47] continued without talking and up to now
[43:49] we still see it around only right now
[43:52] they call
[43:53] mary as a queen other than which was
[43:55] nemo's wife in the past tense this whole
[43:58] neighborhood she was called
[44:00] she had a very hard name
[44:03] and then what she might
[44:08] so inside is to call the queen of heaven
[44:11] and now they all marry the queen of
[44:13] heaven do you see
[44:14] any religion today that has the
[44:16] resemblance of what the brother is
[44:18] talking about
[44:20] so what does it tell you
[44:27] yeah actually
[44:28] that's emphasized many times he says
[44:30] people die but spirits don't
[44:33] die so that's why when whenever you want
[44:35] to compare what you're seeing today or
[44:38] what you are doing yourself
[44:40] if you don't find it in the scripture
[44:43] then you need to
[44:45] you need to find out where it is
[44:47] who do you compare with
[44:50] if you are so angry you become
[44:52] you angered quickly who do you compare
[44:54] with
[44:56] if you are a liar you speak life you
[44:58] tell rice who do you compare with
[45:01] if you cheat and steal who do you
[45:03] compare with
[45:04] me
[45:09] if you paint yourself
[45:11] who do you compare with and remember the
[45:13] jackal that jacob was meant to go to
[45:15] hell
[45:17] it is israel
[45:18] who is the priest with god amen
[45:22] so
[45:23] if you compare with the old jacob and
[45:25] you're cheating a liar
[45:26] you know where you're going
[45:28] who do you compare with
[45:31] when you listen to the worldly music
[45:34] who do you compare with
[45:36] everything you do today there is someone
[45:40] actually preaching to someone and they
[45:41] call it identification
[45:43] that's right
[45:44] and then it says we are identified with
[45:46] christ but whatever people die but
[45:49] spirits don't die so the things you do
[45:51] only identify you with whoever had it
[45:54] before that's right so you need to check
[45:57] up the things that you follow and the
[45:59] people you make your own models
[46:02] all right can we now have the screen on
[46:04] we are going to share
[46:06] the
[46:07] uh the reading we just go straight over
[46:09] to the reading as we did last time
[46:12] and
[46:13] we really will be listening to a few
[46:15] questions here and there
[46:17] and fast forwarding it to whatever we
[46:20] i feel that there will be a point if
[46:22] there is somebody with a question stop
[46:24] stop me and us so that we can be able to
[46:26] listen but if you do not stop me
[46:29] then i think you don't have a question
[46:30] i'll question you
[46:32] and if you can't answer it then you're
[46:33] going to be in trouble
[46:35] praise a lot
[46:37] amen i hope that everybody will be
[46:39] following this up following very well
[46:45] all right
[46:48] now i would like us to start
[46:51] listening in
[46:55] why following in our books
[46:57] chapter five the pergament church age
[47:01] revelation
[47:03] are we still ancient looks like we
[47:05] already went
[47:17] and to the angel of the church in
[47:18] pergamus right
[47:20] these things saith he which hath the
[47:22] sharp sword with two edges
[47:25] i know thy works and where thou dwellest
[47:27] even where satan's seat is yes
[47:30] sister the sisters were online if you
[47:32] can hear
[47:33] when i play let us know whether you can
[47:35] hear sure we need to reconnect this
[47:39] no
[47:40] we need to be connected
[47:44] now hold this fast my name and has not
[47:46] denied my faith
[47:48] even in those days
[48:01] okay let me try to
[48:05] [Music]
[48:09] foreign antipas was my faithful martyr
[48:11] who was slain among you where satan
[48:13] dwelleth
[48:14] but i have a few things against thee
[48:16] because thou has there them that hold
[48:17] the doctrine of balaam who taught balak
[48:20] to cast a stumbling block before the
[48:21] children of israel to eat things you
[48:24] just have to give us a moment
[48:29] okay you can hear where over there but
[48:31] we can't hear
[48:34] so
[48:34] we need to
[48:39] we need to get it fixed first
[48:50] okay let's do it again
[49:14] hmm
[49:28] can you sing the chorus as you try to
[49:30] sergey
[49:54] it's coming
[50:05] so
[50:24] brother what the hell did yourself get
[50:26] some problems
[50:28] yeah usually there are very many
[50:29] beauties
[50:31] guess a problem
[50:45] yeah
[50:46] for some
[50:52] reason whether it is connected now
[50:56] it just disconnected
[50:57] if it is not blinking it means it is
[50:59] connected
[51:01] if it is disconnected
[51:03] it keeps
[51:04] the water
[51:06] white blue
[51:20] but even now that's just connected
[51:23] it may get difficult playing this
[51:26] so
[51:30] you have to put something
[51:31] yeah
[51:33] maybe it is not connected to you
[51:37] okay can that doesn't have a good voice
[51:40] you try that
[51:56] okay so we use that
[52:02] okay those were online
[52:05] forgive us we have uh
[52:08] had a
[52:09] small technical bridge here
[52:16] who disconnected
[52:30] unto idols and to commit fornication

[54:09] which no man knoweth saving he that
[54:11] receiveth it
[54:14] pergamos
[54:16] pergamum ancient name was situated in
[54:19] missia in a district watered by three
[54:21] rivers by one of which it communicated
[54:23] to the sea
[54:24] it was described as the most illustrious
[54:26] city in asia
[54:28] it was a city of culture with the
[54:29] library second only to that in
[54:31] alexandria
[54:32] yet it was a city of great sin
[54:35] given over to licentious rites of
[54:36] worship of escuelapius whom they
[54:38] worshipped in the form of a living
[54:40] serpent which was housed and fed in the
[54:42] temple
[54:43] in this beautiful city of irrigated
[54:45] groves public walks and parks
[54:48] lived a small group of dedicated
[54:49] believers who were not fooled by the
[54:51] veneer of beauty and abhorred the
[54:53] satanic worship that filled the place
[54:56] the age
[54:59] the pergamian age lasted about 300 years
[55:02] from 312 to 606 a.d
[55:06] the messenger
[55:08] using our god-given rule for choosing
[55:10] the messenger to each age that is we
[55:13] choose the one whose ministry most
[55:14] closely approximates that of the first
[55:16] messenger paul
[55:18] we unhesitatingly declare the pergamian
[55:20] messenger to be martin
[55:22] martin was born in 315 in hungary
[55:25] however his life work was in france
[55:27] where he labored in and around tour as a
[55:29] bishop
[55:30] he died in 399.
[55:32] this great saint was the uncle of
[55:34] another wonderful christian saint
[55:36] patrick of ireland
[55:38] martin was converted to christ while he
[55:40] was following a career as a professional
[55:42] soldier
[55:43] it was while he was still engaged in
[55:44] this occupation that a most remarkable
[55:47] miracle occurred
[55:48] it is recorded that a beggar lay sick in
[55:50] the streets of the town where martin was
[55:52] posted
[55:53] the winter cold was more than he could
[55:55] bear for he was poorly clad
[55:57] no one paid any attention to his needs
[55:59] until martin came by seeing this poor
[56:02] man's plight but not having an extra
[56:05] garment he took off his outer cloak
[56:07] cut it in two with his sword and wrapped
[56:09] the cloth around the freezing man
[56:12] he attended him the best he could and
[56:13] went on his way
[56:16] that night the lord jesus appeared unto
[56:17] him in a vision
[56:19] there he stood like a beggar wrapped in
[56:21] a half of martin's garment
[56:23] he spoke to him and said
[56:25] martin though he is only a catechumen
[56:27] has clothed me with this garment
[56:29] from that time on martin sought to serve
[56:31] the lord with all his heart
[56:33] his life became a series of miracles
[56:35] manifesting the power of god
[56:37] after having left the army and having
[56:39] become a leader in the church
[56:41] hey that way did you get that or you
[56:42] missed it
[56:45] what did you get there
[56:47] someone wants to talk about it
[56:51] and then there was silence
[56:54] and you all said you got it
[56:58] yes my brand surely for me
[57:01] i have just read it when we were
[57:03] starting
[57:04] i just loved it so much
[57:06] i've realized one thing
[57:10] that this man had character
[57:14] he had a good character
[57:17] because
[57:18] it is not godu told him to take care of
[57:21] that big yes
[57:22] it
[57:23] was it was his character he was a good
[57:26] man
[57:27] because usually there was a brother was
[57:29] saying you know our works our works god
[57:31] knew eyes he chooses but when you look
[57:34] at this what this man did
[57:36] you can't say that he was led you can't
[57:38] say it was good because it was jesus but
[57:41] i think he had a very good character yes
[57:44] and there is a question which very many
[57:46] people ask themselves why did god say
[57:49] that
[57:50] david had a heart like that of god even
[57:53] david had that heart if you could die
[57:56] for for a sheep to fight with her and so
[57:59] even this man when god i think so that
[58:02] character that good heart
[58:04] it really
[58:05] so that's one thing
[58:08] this is very powerful why do you think
[58:10] brother
[58:12] do you know sister doctors do you even
[58:14] know
[58:14] the person that the brother is talking
[58:16] about
[58:17] who is he talking about
[58:30] which baby is
[58:45] yes
[58:46] he took he took
[58:53] i wanted to imagine
[58:54] oh yeah you are a christian by the way
[58:57] do you know what religion means to be
[58:59] religious
[59:01] do you know what to be religious means
[59:03] who knows it
[59:06] what does it mean
[59:17] people we're in a bible study
[59:19] these are certain things we must
[59:21] get answers for
[59:23] all right yes so i'd like you to pick up
[59:26] your bible first put up down your church
[59:27] edge book pick up your bible
[59:31] and
[59:34] i want to get you to
[59:37] read jim's chapter one
[59:44] verses

[59:49] brother can you give it to me up here on
[59:50] the screen
[59:55] james chapter 1 verses 26
[59:59] and 27

[1:00:08] if your bible is your friend by now you
[1:00:10] should be you should have reached
[1:00:12] but if your bible sees you once in a
[1:00:15] long while and misses you very much
[1:00:17] i'm sure it is still it should even have
[1:00:19] some papers which are stuck together
[1:00:21] it is still as new as you received it
[1:00:25] but if it is your friend by now it
[1:00:26] should be there
[1:00:28] james chapter 1 verse 26 what does it
[1:00:31] say everybody one two three go
[1:00:33] if any man among you seem to be
[1:00:36] religious
[1:00:38] and breedeth not his time
[1:00:41] but deceiveth his own heart
[1:00:44] this man's religion is vain
[1:00:47] pure religion and undefiled before god
[1:00:52] and the father is this
[1:00:54] too visit the fatherless
[1:00:57] and widows in their affliction
[1:01:00] and to keep himself unspotted from the
[1:01:04] world

[1:01:27] uh
[1:01:28] the
[1:01:30] this version here i just love it

[1:01:41] for them to see
[1:01:42] yeah in gems one verse 26
[1:01:45] this is i'm reading from the
[1:01:48] uh
[1:01:49] kjv but
[1:01:51] i can call it the amplified version
[1:01:53] it says
[1:01:55] if anyone thinks himself to be religious
[1:01:58] scrupulously observant of the rituals of
[1:02:01] his faith huh
[1:02:03] if you are saying you are a good
[1:02:04] believer you are you know very religious
[1:02:07] you are a good man a spiritual huh yes
[1:02:12] and does not control his tongue
[1:02:14] but deludes his own art
[1:02:17] if you don't control your time
[1:02:19] yeah you delude your own heart
[1:02:21] your religion is worthless it's futile
[1:02:24] it's barren
[1:02:26] you see yes then
[1:02:28] that's a for another day but
[1:02:30] look at verse 27
[1:02:32] pure and
[1:02:34] and
[1:02:35] unblemished religion
[1:02:39] as it is expressed in outward acts
[1:02:44] you are and what
[1:02:46] an unblemished
[1:02:58] religion
[1:02:59] as it is expressed in outward
[1:03:03] actions you know what james i what i
[1:03:05] love about gems
[1:03:06] james always said show me your faith by
[1:03:08] without your works
[1:03:10] and i will show you my faith by
[1:03:13] my what so here
[1:03:15] he is saying
[1:03:17] pure and any blemish religion
[1:03:20] as it is expressed in our outward word
[1:03:22] acts
[1:03:23] in the sight of our god and the father
[1:03:26] is this
[1:03:28] to visit and look after the fatherless
[1:03:34] to visit and
[1:03:37] if you know of some people who don't
[1:03:39] have a father they are called one
[1:03:42] orphans how many he has ever missed a
[1:03:45] day
[1:03:47] of being kind to sometimes you people
[1:03:49] you have fathers and mothers and you
[1:03:51] forget there are people who don't have
[1:03:52] any
[1:03:53] and there are people here
[1:03:54] who claim to be christians
[1:03:56] and they don't even visit or even they
[1:03:58] know some of them some of you were like
[1:04:01] couldn't be there even orphans
[1:04:03] some of you i've never even thought
[1:04:05] about it
[1:04:07] you see
[1:04:09] those who visit the fatherless and also
[1:04:12] those who look after them
[1:04:17] those who visit them and those who do
[1:04:19] what
[1:04:19] look after them
[1:04:21] you see
[1:04:22] that's why it is good for you as a
[1:04:24] christian always to extend the love of
[1:04:27] god that is in your heart to someone
[1:04:29] else especially the fatherless
[1:04:33] and
[1:04:34] the widows and the world
[1:04:37] in their distress
[1:04:39] so their injury stress they are in
[1:04:40] problems do something today for them
[1:04:44] okay i hope you give that to the lord
[1:04:47] and to keep oneself
[1:04:50] and contaminated by the secular
[1:04:54] world
[1:04:56] so you find someone in distress
[1:04:59] would you help them
[1:05:02] you find
[1:05:03] you believers contaminating themselves
[1:05:06] with the world out there how do you
[1:05:08] coordinate yourself
[1:05:10] how do you contemplate yourself
[1:05:15] like what
[1:05:20] okay that's the extreme now going to
[1:05:22] buzz i really if you're a believer you
[1:05:24] go to about you you need to even be
[1:05:25] excommunicated
[1:05:28] if you're a believer and you go to those
[1:05:29] dance parties there's a big problem with
[1:05:31] you you're not even a believer yet i
[1:05:33] think
[1:05:34] because i believe it's always been
[1:05:35] converted yes
[1:05:38] those parties those you know
[1:05:41] yeah
[1:05:42] we talked about your top last time
[1:05:46] you know
[1:05:47] watching their movies huh watching the
[1:05:50] world
[1:05:51] those were the movies
[1:05:54] which
[1:05:55] have casting which have you know things
[1:05:58] that don't really glorify the name of
[1:06:00] the lord which has sex which has things
[1:06:01] like that you find the believers
[1:06:03] watching things like that that shouldn't
[1:06:05] be watched by believers
[1:06:07] you find them listen to the music of the
[1:06:09] world they are contaminating themselves
[1:06:12] by the things of the world you know you
[1:06:14] are listening
[1:06:16] then before we know if you're also doing
[1:06:17] the same thing because you are
[1:06:19] you are feeding on it
[1:06:21] so don't drop bruce you're contaminating
[1:06:23] you've got to contaminate yourself
[1:06:24] you're very valuable
[1:06:26] tell your neighbor you're very valuable
[1:06:28] you're very very so these are things of
[1:06:31] the world these secular things of the
[1:06:32] world
[1:06:33] please avoid politics
[1:06:42] britain
[1:06:44] brethren each and every one of you i'm
[1:06:47] encouraging you to stay away from me
[1:06:49] stay clear from me amen
[1:06:52] if you do want to take a vote me myself
[1:06:55] i don't vote i've not got it in my life
[1:06:59] but it is not a sin to vote
[1:07:01] so
[1:07:02] if at any time the time of voting has
[1:07:05] come and you want to vote your leader
[1:07:07] go if you prayed over that god is ready
[1:07:10] to force somebody go and vote okay
[1:07:12] because voting is exactly what see go
[1:07:14] and vote after voting go back don't talk
[1:07:17] about politics

[1:07:24] good for you to contaminate yourself for
[1:07:26] those things leave it alone
[1:07:30] why am i feeling like i'm hitting a rock
[1:07:33] leave it alone amen
[1:07:35] god bless you brother
[1:07:37] leave those things
[1:07:39] alone
[1:07:40] those things don't contaminate yourself
[1:07:43] then the other thing is uh
[1:07:45] um
[1:07:46] helping those who are in distress
[1:07:49] the widows the fatherless it doesn't
[1:07:51] have to be only those but anybody who is
[1:07:53] in need
[1:07:54] so you find here the bible is not
[1:07:57] talking about our brother who
[1:08:00] martin
[1:08:02] brother might be something that brother
[1:08:04] has said that he's really that has
[1:08:05] really attached to me
[1:08:08] he said that this man was not
[1:08:11] a you know told by god to go and do this
[1:08:14] but this was out of his heart
[1:08:16] you know you cannot help somebody out of
[1:08:19] your heart and want others to see what
[1:08:22] you're doing
[1:08:23] someone asked a question the other day
[1:08:25] is it right for believers
[1:08:27] to
[1:08:28] give in public
[1:08:30] to me i don't think that is what the
[1:08:32] bible tells us
[1:08:34] you know says
[1:08:35] how men are going to help brother
[1:08:37] brother so and so for in his problem
[1:08:41] no one will show up
[1:08:43] when we tell them come and see the
[1:08:45] pastor
[1:08:47] even when you tell them send offerings
[1:08:50] on phones especially these businesses
[1:08:51] that we are now online
[1:08:52] send offerings on the phone
[1:08:54] people will not send offerings on phone
[1:08:58] but when they are giving when everybody
[1:09:00] is seeing for example on funerals
[1:09:02] on weddings when they are putting them
[1:09:04] on their whatsapp listen there on things
[1:09:06] like that
[1:09:08] everybody's rushing so that their name
[1:09:10] can be with the biggest number he will
[1:09:11] look through
[1:09:13] this was giving 100. this one has a
[1:09:14] given 200. so he's giving me twenty
[1:09:17] thousand this one has given 10 million
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:27] remember that thing
[1:09:28] that's the very very speed that is
[1:09:30] making people do that
[1:09:31] you as a believer you must not give to
[1:09:33] be saved by others amen you must not
[1:09:36] give to be sin by what
[1:09:38] you must always give because you have a
[1:09:40] heart of giving you must always do
[1:09:42] something for someone because you really
[1:09:45] feel in your heart you want to know but
[1:09:46] how can you feel that you want to do it
[1:09:48] really if you do not have character
[1:09:52] what is character
[1:09:55] speaking about character character comes
[1:09:57] only by the things you have suffered the
[1:09:59] things you have gone through the things
[1:10:01] you have experienced brother you know
[1:10:03] you're going through some things in your
[1:10:04] life and you really don't want someone
[1:10:06] else to go through them
[1:10:07] some oh god help me i'm feeling annoyed
[1:10:09] where i talk about me sometimes people
[1:10:11] they want to help someone or they think
[1:10:13] that when only those who have so much
[1:10:17] they should be the ones to help or they
[1:10:19] think that because you you you when
[1:10:21] someone has helped them they think oh
[1:10:23] they have too much they have plenty
[1:10:25] they're rich yeah especially in uganda
[1:10:28] you know that spirit is so strong i've
[1:10:30] not seen it in some other countries in
[1:10:33] uganda it is very strong
[1:10:35] you know when you when someone has
[1:10:37] helped you you think
[1:10:39] this person is so rich it means i can
[1:10:41] even give much more
[1:10:42] you know and even some people don't give
[1:10:45] because you think they are not rich
[1:10:47] that's a bad spirit let me tell you
[1:10:50] you know when you are going to give
[1:10:51] yourself because you have too much yes
[1:10:53] giving is a a character like the mother
[1:10:56] said a character it's character that you
[1:10:58] have learned it's a it's something which
[1:11:00] is in your heart that you really want to
[1:11:03] do for somebody for for their livelihood
[1:11:05] for their for their you know someone
[1:11:07] registered for the brother you know you
[1:11:09] want to do something for someone because
[1:11:11] in your heart you oppressed you are led
[1:11:13] you are you understand
[1:11:15] it's something you feel and when you do
[1:11:17] it oh you feel so nice and happy and you
[1:11:19] don't want anyone to know that you did
[1:11:21] it
[1:11:22] let me tell you
[1:11:23] if you ever do something and you feel
[1:11:26] you want people to know how to
[1:11:27] appreciate you
[1:11:29] then you never did give
[1:11:31] you never did do that
[1:11:33] these days before giving cameras even

[1:11:36] go and head up all the orphans and
[1:11:38] everywhere they they collect people with
[1:11:40] camera they go

[1:11:49] don't need to go in the lineup to be
[1:11:50] seen yes
[1:11:52] do what you are doing because it is your
[1:11:54] character it is a part of it is your
[1:11:56] life
[1:11:57] amen right
[1:11:58] now we have like that as we are
[1:12:01] beginning the pagan church age
[1:12:03] martin who was the messenger of this
[1:12:05] church age
[1:12:07] he found a beggar a beggar how many find
[1:12:10] a beggar and they dismissed them
[1:12:13] this man found a beggar laying sick he
[1:12:16] was a beggar and he was
[1:12:19] sick
[1:12:20] on the streets of the town
[1:12:24] and when martin
[1:12:25] saw him
[1:12:27] oh
[1:12:28] his heart went up to this man he was
[1:12:30] cold
[1:12:31] you know
[1:12:32] the man was dressed badly you know
[1:12:35] no one paid any attention to his needs
[1:12:37] and you know it doesn't mean that there
[1:12:39] were no people or christians passing by
[1:12:41] they were christians but martin saw this
[1:12:44] man he was like oh
[1:12:46] he was touched immediately because he
[1:12:48] was a christian he he also had a
[1:12:50] character he also had the love of god in
[1:12:52] himself
[1:12:56] there's someone who sang a song said you
[1:12:58] know nothing
[1:13:00] until you know
[1:13:02] the love of god
[1:13:05] you know i don't know if you have ever
[1:13:06] heard of that song
[1:13:08] so
[1:13:09] the man
[1:13:10] did not have what to give
[1:13:12] sure
[1:13:14] he said what can i do maybe you didn't
[1:13:15] even have mine to go buy another cloth
[1:13:18] what did he do
[1:13:20] he decided to cut a piece of what he had
[1:13:22] he knew he needed it also but he knew
[1:13:24] that man also needed some so he said we
[1:13:27] shall share what we have
[1:13:28] we shall do what share what
[1:13:31] let me tell you
[1:13:34] we as christians do not give because we
[1:13:36] have too much
[1:13:38] we don't give because we have sometimes
[1:13:40] myself personally have given until i
[1:13:42] never remain with anything
[1:13:45] at times that we will put my family at
[1:13:47] risk
[1:13:48] because i do not know what we will use
[1:13:51] at home but i give as far as i am led to
[1:13:54] it
[1:13:55] not as far as much as i have but as much
[1:13:58] as i am late and with whatever i have i
[1:14:01] can share that with somebody else
[1:14:03] and martin
[1:14:05] noticed
[1:14:06] martin
[1:14:08] you know this
[1:14:09] must be cut off a piece of his cloth
[1:14:12] and he covered this man who was freezing
[1:14:16] he attended him the best he could and
[1:14:19] went his way he didn't even say what is
[1:14:21] your number so i can look you up or you
[1:14:23] know give me a whatsapp number so can be
[1:14:25] friends
[1:14:26] he wasn't helping this man because of
[1:14:28] what he was going to get out of it
[1:14:30] all the glory that oh even this man i
[1:14:32] don't even think this man had the
[1:14:33] strength to tell him thank you
[1:14:36] he helped him because of the love which
[1:14:38] was in his heart
[1:14:40] that made the lord just jesus passed
[1:14:43] unto him in a vision after he had that
[1:14:45] man jesus came to him in a vision at
[1:14:47] night
[1:14:48] there he stood like a beggar wrapped in
[1:14:51] a half of martinez garment
[1:14:54] now some of you are beginning to
[1:14:55] understand what had happened
[1:14:57] he spoke to him and said martin
[1:15:00] though he is only a a cartilage man
[1:15:03] has closed me with his garment
[1:15:07] hallelujah
[1:15:09] imagine
[1:15:10] this man
[1:15:11] was able
[1:15:13] hallelujah to understand
[1:15:16] that
[1:15:18] who the person he held was not actually
[1:15:21] marty
[1:15:22] it was actually our lord jesus oh
[1:15:26] what you have done and to the list of
[1:15:29] the saints you have done it unto me
[1:15:33] whatever little obvious you do for a
[1:15:35] child of god you have done it for the
[1:15:38] lord amen
[1:15:39] this man wasn't even in the church he
[1:15:41] wasn't even a believer by the way
[1:15:44] there would have been people who would
[1:15:45] have judged martin but now could you do
[1:15:47] that
[1:15:48] brother martin
[1:15:51] this is not even a believer who knows
[1:15:53] who
[1:15:54] how do you even know how did he even
[1:15:55] become sick maybe god delivered him
[1:15:57] because of his sins
[1:15:59] maybe god cast him how can how dare you
[1:16:01] take the resources which would have even
[1:16:03] helped others and you are you know
[1:16:04] you're
[1:16:08] but actually that was the lord jesus
[1:16:10] who was in that call it was the lord
[1:16:13] jesus who needed help it was the lord
[1:16:14] jesus christ who needed to a cloth we
[1:16:16] needed something
[1:16:18] and that's why the bible says there's
[1:16:19] more blessing to again

[1:17:18] those brothers was it peter and john
[1:17:22] didn't join us
[1:17:24] they fought that man begging
[1:17:26] the man he's like this must before this
[1:17:28] one
[1:17:29] and

[1:17:40] you see yes we give unto you what do
[1:17:42] they have
[1:17:45] what did they have
[1:17:47] you remember the two things that must be
[1:17:49] the true church that's right yeah sister
[1:17:52] what are those three things that must be
[1:17:53] in the true church number one
[1:17:56] the true word of god
[1:17:58] the true word of god number two
[1:18:03] number two
[1:18:07] the manifestation of the power of god
[1:18:10] amen amen through the gifts and other
[1:18:13] things these people had the power of god
[1:18:16] that manifestation of the power of god
[1:18:18] they said silva and god we have none but
[1:18:20] one year we give unto you right
[1:18:24] and a
[1:18:31] but what they had could make this man
[1:18:34] rich
[1:18:37] do you know what you have can make
[1:18:38] people rich without actually giving them
[1:18:40] money
[1:18:41] if people can receive your jesus
[1:18:44] this jesus is more than just words he
[1:18:48] is power
[1:18:49] hallelujah power that can put people
[1:18:53] to having ideas that's an idea of
[1:18:55] business
[1:18:56] hallelujah
[1:19:01] having that idea of getting an idea what
[1:19:04] i was thinking talking about that i
[1:19:05] remember you brother you now have an
[1:19:07] idea of business and let me tell you if
[1:19:10] you stick with it without getting faith
[1:19:11] and i'm saying this online because i
[1:19:13] know it is recorded and you will hear it
[1:19:16] if you faint not
[1:19:18] that business is going to prosper and
[1:19:20] you are going to be a very rich
[1:19:22] businessman
[1:19:25] that's what is going to happen
[1:19:26] because when you receive these business
[1:19:28] ideas it's not coming from the devil
[1:19:30] it's coming from god
[1:19:32] because god wants us to be given more
[1:19:34] than receivers and god doesn't want us
[1:19:37] to be poor and mediocres and vegans you
[1:19:39] understand so what am i saying you are
[1:19:42] the hands of god be a giver be a giver
[1:19:45] if all of us can be given more than
[1:19:47] receivers there is going to be a revival

[1:19:54] a very militant stand against idolatry
[1:19:56] he cut down the groves broke up the
[1:19:59] images and pulled down the altars
[1:20:01] when confronted by the pagans for his
[1:20:03] deeds he challenged them in much the
[1:20:05] same manner that elijah did the prophets
[1:20:07] of baal
[1:20:08] he offered to be tied to a tree on its
[1:20:10] underside so that when it was cut down
[1:20:12] it would crush him unless god intervened
[1:20:14] and turned the tree around while it fell
[1:20:17] the wiley heathen tied him to a tree
[1:20:19] that was growing on the side of a hill
[1:20:21] assured that the natural pull of gravity
[1:20:23] would cause the tree to so fall as to
[1:20:25] crush him
[1:20:26] just as the tree began to fall
[1:20:29] god swung it around and uphill contrary
[1:20:31] to all natural laws
[1:20:33] the fleeing heathen were crushed as the
[1:20:35] tree fell on several of them
[1:20:38] you people

[1:20:55] this again
[1:20:57] after having left the army and having
[1:20:59] become a leader in the church he took a
[1:21:01] very militant stand against idolatry
[1:21:04] he cut down the groves broke up the
[1:21:06] images and pulled down the altars
[1:21:08] when confronted by the pagans for his
[1:21:10] deeds he challenged them in much the
[1:21:12] same manner that elijah did the prophets
[1:21:14] of baal
[1:21:15] he offered to be tied to a tree on its
[1:21:17] underside so that when it was cut down
[1:21:20] it would crush him unless god intervened
[1:21:22] and turned the tree around while it fell
[1:21:24] the wily heathen tied him to a tree that
[1:21:26] was growing on the side of a hill
[1:21:28] assured that the natural pull of gravity
[1:21:30] would cause the tree to so fall as to
[1:21:32] crush him
[1:21:34] just as the tree began to fall
[1:21:36] god swung it around and uphill contrary
[1:21:38] to all natural laws
[1:21:40] the fleeing heathen were crushed as the
[1:21:42] tree fell on several of them
[1:21:45] hallelujah
[1:21:48] hallelujah
[1:21:49] yes sir they were trying to tell him
[1:21:52] that god is serving he's not a true god
[1:21:55] the god i'm serving is not a true god
[1:21:57] okay do your rest
[1:21:59] ah you don't even like martin and tell
[1:22:01] the devil to do his worse
[1:22:05] okay we'll try you on a tree upside down
[1:22:08] the other side whereby when we cut it
[1:22:10] you everyone can see you know by logic
[1:22:13] by the reality and everything that
[1:22:15] usually the tree is going to fall on you
[1:22:17] and keep you because this is we are we
[1:22:19] are trying to get this side down and why
[1:22:21] for us we are up here on the hill
[1:22:33] [Music]
[1:22:51] friends yes
[1:22:52] god swung that the tree around uphill
[1:22:56] contrary to all natural laws
[1:23:00] amen when god is in your life when you
[1:23:03] receive this living god he is able to
[1:23:06] change everything and anything in your
[1:23:09] life against all natural rules
[1:23:13] hallelujah
[1:23:14] why because he is the creator of all
[1:23:17] this love amen
[1:23:22] hallelujah if they say that you have to
[1:23:25] first get to 30 or 40 to prosper god can
[1:23:29] make you prosper at 15.
[1:23:32] yes
[1:23:33] yes if they say you have to first do
[1:23:35] this to have this god can do the
[1:23:37] opposite yes verify there is not that
[1:23:40] our god cannot turn around
[1:23:43] historians acknowledge that on at least
[1:23:45] three occasions he raised the dead by
[1:23:47] faith in jesus name
[1:23:49] in one instance he prayed for a dead
[1:23:51] baby
[1:23:52] like elisha he stretched himself upon
[1:23:54] the babe and prayed
[1:23:56] it came back to life and health
[1:23:59] on another occasion he was called to
[1:24:01] help deliver a brother who was being
[1:24:02] carried away to his death in a time of
[1:24:04] great persecution
[1:24:06] by the time he arrived the poor man was
[1:24:08] already dead
[1:24:10] they had hanged him upon a tree
[1:24:12] his body was lifeless and his eyes
[1:24:13] protruded from the sockets but martin
[1:24:16] took him down and when he had prayed the
[1:24:18] man was restored to life and to his
[1:24:20] rejoicing family
[1:24:23] martin never did fear the enemy
[1:24:24] regardless of who it was
[1:24:27] thus he went to personally face a wicked
[1:24:29] emperor who was responsible for the
[1:24:30] death of many spirit-filled saints
[1:24:33] the emperor would not grant an audience
[1:24:35] so martin went to see a friend of the
[1:24:37] emperor juan damasus a cruel bishop of
[1:24:40] rome
[1:24:41] but the bishop being a nominal christian
[1:24:43] of the false vine would not intercede
[1:24:46] martin went back to the palace but by
[1:24:48] now the gates had been locked and they
[1:24:50] would not allow him to enter
[1:24:52] he laid down on his face before the lord
[1:24:54] and prayed that he be able to get into
[1:24:55] the palace
[1:24:57] he heard a voice bidding him arise
[1:24:59] when he did so he saw the gates open of
[1:25:01] their own accord
[1:25:02] he walked into the court
[1:25:04] but the arrogant ruler would not turn
[1:25:06] his head and speak to him
[1:25:09] when they got the cross gets on you god
[1:25:11] will open them
[1:25:14] that's why they say that you know i've
[1:25:16] given you an open door that a man won't
[1:25:17] be able to cross when god opens a door
[1:25:21] for you my brother if it was time for
[1:25:22] god to open a door for you you won't
[1:25:24] struggle
[1:25:38] all you need to do is to ask
[1:25:40] talk
[1:25:41] and if you're proposing rejected by the
[1:25:43] workers all the time
[1:25:45] because the door is the right time for
[1:25:47] you to open for that particular door god
[1:25:50] will open it for you without you having
[1:25:52] to struggle
[1:25:53] you know
[1:25:55] my brother and my sister
[1:25:57] do not struggle with the things of this
[1:25:59] life
[1:26:00] amen which is the god who opens doors
[1:26:02] and just go to classes
[1:26:04] there are ways to be open
[1:26:13] suddenly a fire came spontaneously from
[1:26:15] the seat of the throne and the unhappy
[1:26:16] emperor vacated speedily
[1:26:19] surely the lord humbles the crowd and
[1:26:20] exalts the lowly
[1:26:23] he goes to the bishop who had knocked
[1:26:25] himself
[1:26:29] open
[1:26:33] amen praise the name of the lord brother
[1:26:38] can you now hear me here clear
[1:26:40] are we now clear
[1:26:46] okay
[1:26:47] so
[1:26:49] don't open the doors
[1:26:51] don't open the doors and after the doors
[1:26:54] i don't know why but the brother said
[1:26:56] they cannot hear
[1:26:58] the rest can you hear us
[1:27:16] oh

[1:30:00] and in a minute i'm going to excuse
[1:30:02] myself brother we will
[1:30:05] help us continue but then i'll be back
[1:30:08] anyways let us hear that part
[1:30:14] such was his order and serving the lord
[1:30:16] that the devil was mightily aroused
[1:30:19] and i was just uh
[1:30:20] commenting on how
[1:30:24] the devil wanted to have him finished
[1:30:26] and not enter in but he they never
[1:30:29] couldn't stop him they never cannot stop
[1:30:30] you where god has sent you yes and when
[1:30:32] the man when he reached there the man
[1:30:34] decided to turn his head and when he
[1:30:37] turned his head
[1:30:38] god put a fire on his seat
[1:30:41] god put a fire on his seat and he had to
[1:30:43] turn by force
[1:30:46] hallelujah
[1:30:49] you know
[1:30:50] if god wants you to meet people even if
[1:30:52] they don't want to meet you god will put
[1:30:54] a fire on them to meet you
[1:30:56] amen that's the god we serve
[1:30:58] therefore we believe in a god that can
[1:31:00] do all things we believe in a god who
[1:31:03] makes all things possible such was his
[1:31:05] order in serving the lord that the devil
[1:31:07] was mightily aroused
[1:31:08] the enemies of truth hired assassins to
[1:31:10] kill martin
[1:31:12] they came by stealth to his home and as
[1:31:14] they were about to kill him he stood
[1:31:16] erect and bared his throat to the sword
[1:31:19] as they leaped forward the power of god
[1:31:21] suddenly hurled them back across the
[1:31:22] room
[1:31:24] so overcome were they in that holy and
[1:31:26] fearful atmosphere that they crawled
[1:31:28] upon their hands and knees and begged
[1:31:30] forgiveness for the attempt upon his
[1:31:32] life
[1:31:33] too often when men are signally used of
[1:31:35] the lord they become lifted up with
[1:31:36] pride but not so with martin he ever
[1:31:40] remained the humble servant of god
[1:31:42] one night as he was preparing himself to
[1:31:44] enter the pulpit a beggar came to his
[1:31:47] study and asked for some clothing
[1:31:49] martin referred the beggar to his head
[1:31:50] deacon the haughty deacon commanded him
[1:31:53] to leave
[1:31:54] thereupon he went back to see martin
[1:31:56] martin arose and gave the beggar his own
[1:31:59] fine robe and bad the deacon bring him
[1:32:00] another robe which was of lesser quality
[1:32:03] that night as martin preached the word
[1:32:05] the flock of god saw a soft white glow
[1:32:07] of light around his person
[1:32:10] surely this was a great man a true
[1:32:12] messenger to that age
[1:32:14] never desirous of ought but to please
[1:32:16] god he lived a most consecrated life
[1:32:18] never could he be induced to preach
[1:32:20] until he had first prayed and was in
[1:32:22] such spiritual frame as to know and
[1:32:24] deliver the full counsel of god by the
[1:32:26] holy ghost sent down from heaven
[1:32:28] often he would keep the people waiting
[1:32:30] while he prayed for full assurance
[1:32:33] just to know about martin and his mighty
[1:32:35] ministry might make one thing that the
[1:32:36] persecution of the saints had abated
[1:32:39] not so
[1:32:40] they were still being destroyed by the
[1:32:42] devil through the instrumentality of the
[1:32:44] wicked they were burned at the stake
[1:32:46] they were nailed to logs face down and
[1:32:48] wild dogs were turned loose upon them so
[1:32:51] that the dogs would tear away the flesh
[1:32:53] and bowels leaving the victims to die in
[1:32:55] terrible torture
[1:32:57] babes were ripped from expectant mothers
[1:32:59] and thrown to the hogs
[1:33:01] women's breasts were cut away and they
[1:33:02] were forced to stand erect while each
[1:33:04] heartthrob poured out the blood until
[1:33:06] they crumpled in death
[1:33:08] and the tragedy was even greater to
[1:33:10] think about when one realizes that this
[1:33:12] was not solely the work of the heathen
[1:33:15] but many times it was caused by
[1:33:16] so-called christians who felt that they
[1:33:19] did god a favor in exterminating these
[1:33:21] loyal soldiers of the cross who stood
[1:33:23] for the word and obedience to the holy
[1:33:25] spirit
[1:33:26] john 16 2
[1:33:29] they shall put you out of the synagogues
[1:33:31] yea the time cometh that whosoever
[1:33:33] killeth you will think that he doeth
[1:33:35] god's service
[1:33:37] matthew 24 9
[1:33:40] then shall they deliver you up to be
[1:33:42] afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[1:33:44] shall be hated of all nations for my
[1:33:46] name's sake
[1:33:49] by signs and wonders by the power of the
[1:33:51] spirit martin was truly vindicated as
[1:33:54] the messenger to that age
[1:33:56] but not only was he gifted by a great
[1:33:58] ministry he himself was forever true to
[1:34:00] the word of god he fought organization
[1:34:05] yes god bless you brethren
[1:34:08] something was
[1:34:10] in that
[1:34:11] that
[1:34:12] paragraph on top
[1:34:15] there was something very
[1:34:16] astounding astonishing
[1:34:20] when martin
[1:34:22] became so it says here
[1:34:25] actually it started here behind it says
[1:34:28] when martin started serving god
[1:34:32] the devil was mightily
[1:34:34] arosed
[1:34:35] the enemies of truth hired assassins to
[1:34:38] kill him now when you look at this this
[1:34:41] chapter here it is showing
[1:34:44] how the devil threw the wicked
[1:34:46] instrumentality of the wicked ones
[1:34:48] people were banned
[1:34:50] people were given to actually have a
[1:34:52] video on my computer people were burned
[1:34:55] people were
[1:34:57] we are beaten
[1:34:59] people we are
[1:35:02] people we are fed to lions but when it
[1:35:05] was coming
[1:35:06] you know you know
[1:35:08] when there was a summon when they were
[1:35:10] preaching and
[1:35:12] this edge where we are all the spirits
[1:35:15] and all the challenges which happened in
[1:35:18] the past ages they're going to be in
[1:35:20] this age
[1:35:22] what was inefficient what was in
[1:35:23] programs what was in theater what was in
[1:35:26] sudden
[1:35:27] so one thing which came to my heart when
[1:35:28] we were passing this part that if the
[1:35:32] uh the the paragme and church age people
[1:35:34] were here
[1:35:35] yeah we are blunted we are tortured the
[1:35:38] things will come to us
[1:35:41] the major point we need to learn here is
[1:35:44] when they come to us
[1:35:46] it should not be news
[1:35:48] you know you know it is very much taught
[1:35:50] in the pentacles the world when you're
[1:35:51] suffering you don't have a job when you
[1:35:53] don't have money when things are not
[1:35:55] well they
[1:35:56] the the pentecostal religious teachers
[1:35:58] and people feel you are cast
[1:36:00] god doesn't know you god doesn't love
[1:36:03] you but in this age
[1:36:05] god gave them the grace that we have
[1:36:08] killed were christian and they come and
[1:36:11] cut off your head and your sister sister
[1:36:13] sister sister peace become a trick trick
[1:36:16] trick and a christian even speak in
[1:36:19] tongues and they catch you
[1:36:22] pregnant woman they come and remove the
[1:36:25] child and they throw them on down they
[1:36:27] give them another christian speaking in
[1:36:29] times they are leaders in the church
[1:36:32] but did it mean that god was not caring
[1:36:35] for them
[1:36:36] no
[1:36:37] so that mindset is very wrong never
[1:36:40] think suffer
[1:36:42] problems
[1:36:43] challenges bad things happening around
[1:36:46] you they're happening maybe because
[1:36:48] you're sinning maybe because you have
[1:36:50] cases no
[1:36:53] sometimes
[1:36:54] christians holy spirit filled heading to
[1:36:58] the promised land can't go through these
[1:36:59] things that's right they can't be
[1:37:01] tortured and god is aware he's watching
[1:37:04] my brother
[1:37:05] you don't have a job and he knows it
[1:37:08] you don't have man and he knows it
[1:37:11] even right now what the world is going
[1:37:13] through the heavenly father
[1:37:16] knows everything he knows that you're
[1:37:18] sitting at home he knows that you don't
[1:37:20] know what to do and everything is in
[1:37:23] place yes amen amen amen
[1:37:27] may the lord bless you
[1:37:30] oh thanks brother for that submission
[1:37:32] we're so grateful that is what happened
[1:37:34] to jesus yeah one was our example sure
[1:37:37] he was killed by
[1:37:39] religious people exactly the herodians
[1:37:42] pharisees
[1:37:44] they killed him
[1:37:46] not because you have something bad yeah
[1:37:50] but the religious and we're seeing also
[1:37:54] the people are going to
[1:37:56] persecute
[1:37:57] the foolish
[1:37:59] bargains
[1:38:00] those ones are also going to be a
[1:38:02] religious group
[1:38:04] so in each age was a religious group
[1:38:07] persecuting the others
[1:38:11] he withstood sin in high places he
[1:38:14] championed the truth in word and deed
[1:38:16] and lived out a full life of christian
[1:38:18] victory
[1:38:19] a biographer wrote of him on this wise
[1:38:23] no one ever saw him angry or disturbed
[1:38:25] or grieving or laughing
[1:38:27] he was always one and the same and
[1:38:29] seemed something beyond mortal wearing
[1:38:31] on his countenance a sort of celestial
[1:38:33] joy
[1:38:35] never was anything on his lips but
[1:38:36] christ never anything in his heart but
[1:38:39] piety peace and pity
[1:38:41] often did he weep for the sins even of
[1:38:43] those his detractors
[1:38:45] who when he was quiet and absent
[1:38:47] attacked him with viperous lips and
[1:38:48] poisoned tongues
[1:38:50] many hated him for virtues they
[1:38:52] themselves did not possess and could not
[1:38:54] imitate and alas his bitterest
[1:38:56] assailants were bishops
[1:39:00] the salutation
[1:39:02] revelation two
[1:39:06] there's something up here he says
[1:39:23] about this statement the brothers picked
[1:39:25] from this
[1:39:27] it says that his bitterest asylums were
[1:39:31] bishops
[1:39:32] you know very many people think that the
[1:39:35] serpent seed there are those drunkard
[1:39:37] people there that those as the the
[1:39:40] prescripts on the road
[1:39:42] the serpent said brother branham said
[1:39:45] kyle was a religious man
[1:39:47] he was a religious man now when you look
[1:39:49] at the major
[1:39:51] group of people which tortured brutal
[1:39:54] and did very many bad things to
[1:39:57] believers they were doing religious
[1:39:59] people
[1:40:00] now let us bring it back to us now
[1:40:03] jesus said that your greatest enemy
[1:40:06] will be in your household
[1:40:09] now to get food from this now it is like
[1:40:12] this
[1:40:14] brother shem
[1:40:15] can do something to you and you can say
[1:40:18] sister that brother is
[1:40:22] can you do such a thing now usually the
[1:40:26] people who
[1:40:28] let me say that
[1:40:29] the devil usually uses people who are
[1:40:32] close to us
[1:40:34] that is number one he usually uses
[1:40:36] people who he least expect
[1:40:40] when you look at peter
[1:40:42] these guys who are the ones working in
[1:40:44] in jesus is what when you look at
[1:40:47] this other
[1:40:51] these are the guys who are working with
[1:40:53] jesus but look they are the same where
[1:40:56] the greatest enemies now to pick from
[1:40:59] that as i summarize is
[1:41:01] your brother this brother
[1:41:12] i am a christian
[1:41:14] but sometimes i can do something and you
[1:41:17] really feel
[1:41:18] oh this man is disappointed
[1:41:20] so basically the devil can use anybody
[1:41:25] he can use anybody and that is why we
[1:41:28] should not hate our brothers right that
[1:41:31] is why the bible tells us to forgive
[1:41:34] bishops bishops it means these were high
[1:41:37] ranking people very big people let me
[1:41:40] tell you even you even the pastor
[1:41:43] himself
[1:41:44] he can tell you something which can cut
[1:41:46] you in pieces
[1:41:48] from somebody
[1:41:49] something with them no don't leave the
[1:41:52] church
[1:41:55] so that is what we can take from that
[1:41:57] part my brother
[1:41:58] don't when you see people fighting you
[1:42:01] enemies maybe even at home maybe your
[1:42:03] father may your mother maybe your sister
[1:42:05] maybe
[1:42:06] maybe somebody with you who you thought
[1:42:08] is very spiritual stand right with god
[1:42:12] and don't hate people that is what the
[1:42:14] bible tells us to forgive
[1:42:53] anything on his
[1:43:08] did he weep
[1:43:11] for the sins
[1:43:13] even
[1:43:19] when
[1:43:20] he was quite an absence
[1:43:22] absent
[1:43:36] they themselves
[1:43:58] like
[1:44:01] what we talk
[1:44:02] about
[1:44:03] everything
[1:44:33] you know to the extent that these people
[1:44:35] hated him because of
[1:44:36] because of his virtues
[1:44:39] i can say that he was bastards he was a
[1:44:41] christian
[1:44:42] and that's why i
[1:44:44] again point out on that
[1:45:00] that's why we should have the
[1:45:14] even
[1:45:28] is
[1:45:42] is
[1:45:59] 12b
[1:46:00] these things sayeth he which hath the
[1:46:02] sharp sword with the two edges
[1:46:05] the message to the third church age is
[1:46:07] about to come forth
[1:46:08] the third scene of this unfolding drama
[1:46:10] of christ in the midst of his church is
[1:46:13] about to be revealed
[1:46:15] with trumpet-like voice the spirit
[1:46:16] presents the matchless one
[1:46:19] he which hath the sharp sword with the
[1:46:20] two edges
[1:46:22] how vastly different is this
[1:46:24] presentation from the time when pilate
[1:46:25] introduced the lamb of god
[1:46:27] clothed in mocking robes of purple
[1:46:30] smitten and thorn crowned saying
[1:46:32] behold your king
[1:46:34] now regal robed and crowned with glory
[1:46:37] stands the risen lord christ the power
[1:46:40] of god
[1:46:42] in these words
[1:46:43] he which hath the sharp sword with two
[1:46:45] edges lies another revelation of godhead
[1:46:49] in the ephesian age you will recall he
[1:46:51] was set forth as the unchanging god in
[1:46:54] the smernian age we saw him as the one
[1:46:56] true god and beside him there was no
[1:46:59] other
[1:47:00] now in this pergamon age there is a
[1:47:01] further revelation of his godhead set
[1:47:04] forth by his association with the sharp
[1:47:06] two-edged sword which is the word of god
[1:47:09] hebrews 4 12
[1:47:11] for the word of god is quick and
[1:47:13] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:47:16] sword piercing even to the dividing
[1:47:18] asunder of soul and spirit and of the
[1:47:20] joints and marrow and is a discerner of
[1:47:23] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:47:26] ephesians 6 17
[1:47:28] and take the sword of the spirit which
[1:47:30] is the word of god
[1:47:32] revelation 19 13 and 15 a
[1:47:36] and he was clothed with a vesture dipped
[1:47:38] in blood
[1:47:39] and his name is called the word of god
[1:47:42] and out of his mouth
[1:48:08] i know
[1:48:45] individual individuals
[1:49:23] is
[1:49:36] is
[1:49:55] my
[1:50:12] um
[1:50:35] us
[1:50:50] me
[1:51:05] is
[1:51:27] i think someone is someone touching this
[1:51:29] one
[1:51:34] how is it now brethren
[1:51:40] it is fine now
[1:51:44] so
[1:51:45] um
[1:51:46] what was i talking about
[1:51:50] someone has to remind me because there's
[1:51:52] something i i really was talking about
[1:51:54] and then
[1:52:00] i was talking about the word being a
[1:52:02] design
[1:52:03] of the thoughts and intents
[1:52:05] of the heart
[1:52:06] how didn't we
[1:52:08] and then these things got got issues
[1:52:11] okay so let's get back to that so what i
[1:52:14] was saying is uh and when the holy
[1:52:16] spirit gives me something to speak on
[1:52:19] then
[1:52:20] it becomes something like a thought like
[1:52:22] i thought
[1:52:23] you know like i thought maybe laugh
[1:52:26] yes
[1:52:29] i don't know what is it which direction
[1:52:31] because you can take love on many
[1:52:32] directions i don't know what exactly i
[1:52:35] don't take even
[1:53:48] it is fine now
[1:53:52] what it is about hashem
[1:53:59] okay uh
[1:54:01] please we apologize uh we do not know
[1:54:03] you need to pray so that uh
[1:54:05] this thing
[1:54:07] the devil doesn't uh
[1:54:13] okay now i would like to know how the
[1:54:15] sound is right now
[1:54:17] if that is fine then i think we can go
[1:54:19] with that
[1:54:30] okay
[1:54:33] okay
[1:54:35] all right so
[1:54:36] i think there must have been something i
[1:54:38] wanted to say that the holy spirit was
[1:54:40] leading me too and the devil
[1:54:42] tried as hard as possible to stop me
[1:54:44] so i was reminding you of the meetings
[1:54:47] which you have just completed recently
[1:54:50] on the the two consecutive surroundings
[1:54:53] on the power of free moral agency by the
[1:54:56] way
[1:54:57] to those of you who have listened maybe
[1:54:58] you have even been in the service i am
[1:55:00] requesting you i've never requested you
[1:55:02] to go back and listen again because it
[1:55:04] would seem as if you're not listening to
[1:55:05] the prophet no i would like you to go
[1:55:07] back and listen again to those sermons
[1:55:11] those two servants
[1:55:13] huh
[1:55:14] all of us just go back and listen
[1:55:16] if there are some ones i wanted to
[1:55:18] listen to again
[1:55:19] myself people know here that i don't
[1:55:21] want to listen to myself but those ones
[1:55:24] those ones because
[1:55:25] that was a real true inspiration god was
[1:55:28] speaking to us
[1:55:29] please go back and listen because i know
[1:55:31] many of you need to make many decisions
[1:55:33] in your life and you need to be guided
[1:55:35] by the whole respect and how to make
[1:55:36] those kind of decisions
[1:55:38] so uh brother andrew was asking me to
[1:55:42] prepare for
[1:55:44] one of their youth meetings i think i'd
[1:55:45] have to check that thought again because
[1:55:47] i kind of thought maybe they also needed
[1:55:49] some young people there
[1:55:51] so the word of god is a designer
[1:55:54] never ever come to church and hear a
[1:55:57] preacher preaching and then you say oh
[1:56:01] that
[1:56:02] he knows me you know it has happened
[1:56:04] sometimes
[1:56:05] some place where i was
[1:56:07] or not everywhere but a preacher
[1:56:10] preached
[1:56:11] and a brother came very very angry
[1:56:14] he said um
[1:56:15] you know how come
[1:56:18] you called me a pig
[1:56:21] because because i was talking about
[1:56:25] i was talking about
[1:56:27] it was easter resurrection morning you
[1:56:30] know i was talking about the the
[1:56:31] resurrection of jesus christ yeah and
[1:56:33] under who jesus christ was and why he
[1:56:36] was the one the lamb of god that to
[1:56:37] check out the sins of the world
[1:56:39] he muslim had considered him that's what
[1:56:42] i was saying
[1:56:43] he was a sheep he was a what a sheep a
[1:56:45] lamb therefore adapt
[1:56:47] rest on him
[1:56:49] but adapt cannot rest
[1:56:51] the devil because the time of the holy
[1:56:52] spirit adam cannot rest on some people
[1:56:56] with the creatures of
[1:56:59] pigs of
[1:57:00] gods of you know you know a pig always
[1:57:03] loves man
[1:57:05] that's the goddamn man i appreciate
[1:58:00] that i called him a pig i didn't call
[1:58:02] him i could not call him anyone a pig
[1:58:04] how could they call him a pig but if he
[1:58:06] failed i called him a pig you know and
[1:58:09] another sister when when a brother
[1:58:11] there's a brother who came and preached
[1:58:14] after preaching for some time
[1:58:16] then uh
[1:58:18] you know the world was so good
[1:58:21] but those of us who were in the church
[1:58:22] we knew that this brother is preaching
[1:58:24] about this sister
[1:58:26] you know
[1:58:27] i'm like yeah of course the word is for
[1:58:29] everyone right
[1:58:30] but sometimes the word comes directly to
[1:58:33] someone's life
[1:58:34] so those of you who are around you know
[1:58:36] everything you know everyone is nature
[1:58:38] here
[1:58:40] they can't hear
[1:58:41] but no they should hear now so uh
[1:58:44] you know they know you know everyone is
[1:58:46] nature so uh when uh
[1:58:48] imagine someone comes up
[1:58:50] and uh
[1:58:54] and um
[1:58:55] and you know brother o'kello you know
[1:58:57] brother joelle you know isaac and
[1:58:59] everyone right
[1:59:00] and then someone comes as a vista from
[1:59:02] somewhere and begins to roast that
[1:59:03] person very well
[1:59:08] so so now you begin you're like ah
[1:59:11] there's a preacher so not this sister
[1:59:13] she said this is too much for me
[1:59:18] the sister said this is too much for me
[1:59:20] she actually revolted she even went out
[1:59:22] of the chat while they were still
[1:59:23] preaching ah she was not happy and then
[1:59:26] eventually after the service
[1:59:28] she yeah everybody
[1:59:34] oh no how could pastor begin to tell my
[1:59:36] life to that man
[1:59:38] how could he begin i trusted him as my
[1:59:40] pastor
[1:59:41] he went and began to tell everything to
[1:59:43] him no no no no not already and indeed
[1:59:46] me i was one of the people who received
[1:59:48] that man
[1:59:50] he was a guest
[1:59:52] when i when we received him he never
[1:59:54] even spoke to us as ministers
[1:59:57] and we took him to the pulpit directly
[2:00:00] so there is no way that he might he he
[2:00:02] could have known the life of that
[2:00:04] of that sister
[2:00:06] but what was happening it was god the
[2:00:09] word of god designing a heart
[2:00:11] hallelujah
[2:00:13] this i saw it working in ethiopia
[2:00:15] friends
[2:00:16] when i was in ethiopia
[2:00:18] when we had just gone there
[2:00:20] you know the sister would talk to would
[2:00:22] tell me because even in evangelism
[2:00:24] evangelism not even in the church
[2:00:26] would go there meet a person i meet
[2:00:28] someone i would begin you know
[2:00:30] we didn't i don't have a formula
[2:00:31] whenever i meet someone to share the
[2:00:32] word i just
[2:00:34] start from whatever the holy spirit
[2:00:35] leads me you know
[2:00:36] so
[2:00:37] the sister will tell me that man
[2:00:41] you spoke to him everything he has been
[2:00:43] doing you you were the uh the holy
[2:00:46] spirit was speaking about it as if you
[2:00:47] know you oh you know that sister society
[2:00:49] is quite a character so she was
[2:00:51] you you undressed him you spoke
[2:00:53] everything and
[2:00:55] me i really knew it was the holy spirit
[2:00:56] that's why i was telling you to continue
[2:00:57] to continue to continue
[2:00:59] that's how the word is friends the word
[2:01:01] is a desire
[2:01:02] the word is a designer of the thoughts
[2:01:04] and entrance of man so when you come and
[2:01:07] you hear peace say
[2:01:08] ah now my brother might have told you
[2:01:12] please never do that when you do that
[2:01:13] you are canon
[2:01:14] when you hear the word
[2:01:16] you know touching yourself please
[2:01:18] receive it please receive it accept it
[2:01:21] because it is god sometimes even that's
[2:01:23] why sometimes god doesn't move you know
[2:01:25] god can come to you like it has happened
[2:01:27] here several times in prophetic
[2:01:28] administration or or you know something
[2:01:31] you know like it can be a time and
[2:01:32] prophecy it can be anything you know
[2:01:34] vision or something sometimes i've seen
[2:01:35] a vision about something sad i think he
[2:01:37] says the pastor already i told him about
[2:01:39] that it means he shared that with that
[2:01:41] person that's right no
[2:01:43] please believe in the supernatural
[2:01:45] believe in god believe if you don't
[2:01:48] believe even if the man knew about your
[2:01:50] life
[2:01:52] ask yourself what is it that moved him
[2:01:54] to speak to you in that manner
[2:01:56] you know yes what is that that moved him
[2:01:59] because a preacher under the anointing
[2:02:00] of the holy spirit is very very
[2:02:02] different
[2:02:03] very very different it is not the person
[2:02:05] that you know that you usually start
[2:02:07] with
[2:02:08] okay is usually very very different is
[2:02:10] god ministering to you god is speaking
[2:02:12] to you and always listen to that if you
[2:02:15] do that it will
[2:02:17] count so much in your life the word of
[2:02:19] god is a designer of the thoughts and
[2:02:21] intents the intentions of your heart
[2:02:25] sometimes even what you've been thinking
[2:02:27] that you're going to do
[2:02:29] that is this young man you know you know
[2:02:32] isaac
[2:02:34] some of you you remember when we were in
[2:02:36] prayer here and the holy spirit moved in
[2:02:38] something like sometimes it does and you
[2:02:40] know the anointing was so heavy and uh
[2:02:43] and the prophetic administration was
[2:02:45] given to him tell me when that serves i
[2:02:46] think you're doing that service and what
[2:02:48] you're speaking to the the other brother
[2:02:50] and uh he
[2:02:52] he came back to me and said well this
[2:02:54] time i have believed that god
[2:02:56] i thought so all jesus has not been
[2:02:58] believed
[2:02:59] said this time i believe said why
[2:03:01] because god spoke to him
[2:03:03] told him the intentions that he had the
[2:03:05] intentions of his heart things which had
[2:03:07] not yet done told anybody but he was
[2:03:09] intending to do them
[2:03:11] you know i'm not going to personal
[2:03:13] things but
[2:03:14] what does it come to it comes to you to
[2:03:16] understand that god can god knows your
[2:03:18] heart right god can design your heart he
[2:03:21] knows the intentions of your heart even
[2:03:23] those things which have not shared with
[2:03:24] anybody god knows what you intend to do
[2:03:27] and then if i can come and anoint a man
[2:03:30] someone maybe you know commonly you
[2:03:32] always talk to say he speaks to you you
[2:03:34] know maybe by way of a gift or by the
[2:03:37] word and deserves your heart please
[2:03:39] whenever you hear that be sensitive to
[2:03:41] the holy spirit receive it when you know
[2:03:43] when you can feel god when you can
[2:03:45] understand when you can design also you
[2:03:47] must also have some sort of sense of
[2:03:48] desirement to know that god is designing
[2:03:51] you you can work and decide oh that's
[2:03:52] the holy spirit then feel it receive it
[2:03:54] and apply it upon your life
[2:03:56] hallelujah
[2:03:57] emma shall just continue with this now
[2:04:03] with a sharp two-edged sword
[2:04:06] john 1 133
[2:04:09] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:04:11] word was with god and the word was god
[2:04:14] the same word was in the beginning with
[2:04:17] god
[2:04:18] all things were made by him and without
[2:04:20] him was not anything made which was made
[2:04:23] first john 5 7
[2:04:26] there are three that bear record in
[2:04:28] heaven the father the word and the holy
[2:04:31] ghost
[2:04:32] and these three are one
[2:04:35] now we can see his association with the
[2:04:37] word
[2:04:38] he is the word
[2:04:40] that is who he is
[2:04:42] the word in his name
[2:04:45] in john 1 1
[2:04:47] where it says
[2:04:49] in the beginning was the word
[2:04:51] the root from which we get our
[2:04:52] translation for word is logos
[2:04:55] which means the thought or concept
[2:04:58] it has the double meaning of thought and
[2:05:00] speech
[2:05:01] now a thought expressed is a word or
[2:05:03] words
[2:05:04] isn't that wonderful and beautiful
[2:05:07] john says the concept of god was
[2:05:09] expressed in jesus
[2:05:10] and paul says the very same thing in
[2:05:12] hebrews one one through three
[2:05:15] god who at sundry times and in diverse
[2:05:18] manners spake in time past under the
[2:05:20] fathers by the prophets half in these
[2:05:22] last days spoken unto us by his son
[2:05:25] logos whom he hath appointed heir of all
[2:05:28] things by whom also he made the worlds
[2:05:31] who being the brightness of his glory
[2:05:33] and express image of his person and
[2:05:35] upholding all things by the word of his
[2:05:37] power
[2:05:38] when he had by himself purged our sins
[2:05:41] sat down on the right hand of the
[2:05:43] majesty on high
[2:05:45] god became expressed in the person of
[2:05:47] jesus christ
[2:05:49] jesus was the express image of god
[2:05:52] again in john 1 14
[2:05:55] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[2:05:57] among us
[2:05:58] the very substance of god was made flesh
[2:06:00] and dwelt among us the great spirit god
[2:06:03] under which no man could approach which
[2:06:05] no man had seen or could behold was now
[2:06:08] tabernacled in flesh and dwelt among men
[2:06:11] expressing the fullness of god to men
[2:06:14] john 1 18
[2:06:16] no man hath seen god at any time the
[2:06:19] only begotten son which is in the bosom
[2:06:21] of the father he hath declared him
[2:06:24] god who on occasions would manifest his
[2:06:26] presence by the cloud or pillar of fire
[2:06:29] that struck fear in the hearts of men
[2:06:31] this god whose heart characteristics
[2:06:33] were made known only by revelation of
[2:06:35] words through the prophets now became
[2:06:37] emmanuel
[2:06:38] god with us declaring himself
[2:06:42] the word declare is taken from the greek
[2:06:44] root which we often interpret as
[2:06:46] exegesis
[2:06:48] which means to thoroughly explain and
[2:06:49] make clear
[2:06:51] that is what the living word jesus did
[2:06:55] he brought god to us for he was god amen
[2:06:58] revealed god to us with such perfect
[2:07:00] clarity that john could say about him in
[2:07:02] first john 1 1-3
[2:07:06] that which was from the beginning which
[2:07:08] we have heard
[2:07:09] logos mean speech
[2:07:11] which we have seen with our eyes which
[2:07:12] we have looked upon and our hands have
[2:07:15] handled of the word of life
[2:07:17] for the life was manifested and we have
[2:07:18] seen it and bear witness and shew unto
[2:07:20] you that eternal life which was with the
[2:07:23] father and was manifested unto us that
[2:07:26] which we have seen and heard declare we
[2:07:28] unto you that ye also may have
[2:07:30] fellowship with us and truly our
[2:07:32] fellowship is with the father
[2:07:34] and with his son jesus christ
[2:07:37] when god was truly revealed he was
[2:07:39] manifested in the flesh
[2:07:41] he that hath seen me have seen the
[2:07:43] father
[2:07:45] now back in hebrews 1 1-3
[2:07:48] we made note that jesus was the express
[2:07:50] image of god
[2:07:51] he was god expressing himself in man to
[2:07:54] man
[2:07:55] but there is something else to note in
[2:07:57] these verses especially verses 1 and 2.
[2:08:00] god who at sundry times and in diverse
[2:08:03] manners spake in time past unto the
[2:08:05] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[2:08:07] last days spoken unto us by his son
[2:08:10] i want you to notice here in the margin
[2:08:12] of your bible you will see a correction
[2:08:15] the word by is not a correct translation
[2:08:18] it should be in
[2:08:20] not by
[2:08:21] it then reads correctly
[2:08:23] god spake in times past unto the fathers
[2:08:25] in the prophets by means of the word
[2:08:28] first samuel
[2:08:30] 3 21 be
[2:08:32] for the lord revealed himself to samuel
[2:08:34] in shiloh by the word of the lord
[2:08:37] that brings out first john 5 7 perfectly
[2:08:41] the spirit and the word are one
[2:08:43] jesus revealed the father the word
[2:08:46] revealed the father
[2:08:48] jesus was the living word
[2:08:50] praise god today he is still that living
[2:08:53] word amen
[2:08:54] when jesus was upon the earth he said
[2:08:57] believe us thou not that i am in the
[2:08:59] father and the father in me
[2:09:01] the words that i speak unto you i speak
[2:09:03] not of myself
[2:09:05] but the father that dwelleth in me
[2:09:07] he doeth the works
[2:09:09] john 14 10
[2:09:12] here it is most evidently set forth that
[2:09:14] the perfect manifestation of god in the
[2:09:16] sun was by the indwelling spirit
[2:09:18] manifesting in word and works
[2:09:20] that is exactly what we have been
[2:09:22] teaching all along
[2:09:23] when the bride will get back to being a
[2:09:25] word bride she will produce the very
[2:09:27] works that jesus produced hallelujah the
[2:09:30] word is god the spirit is god they are
[2:09:33] all one
[2:09:35] one cannot work apart from the other
[2:09:37] if one truly has the spirit of god he
[2:09:40] will have the word of god
[2:09:42] that is how it was with the prophets
[2:09:44] they had the indwelling spirit of god
[2:09:46] and the word came to them
[2:09:48] that is how it was with jesus
[2:09:50] in him was the spirit without measure
[2:09:52] and the word came to him
[2:09:54] jesus both began to do and teach
[2:09:57] my doctrine is not my own but the
[2:09:59] fathers that sent me
[2:10:01] acts 1 1 john 7 16.
[2:10:05] there's
[2:10:06] there's a bit there that i really am
[2:10:08] interested in he says when the bride
[2:10:10] will get back to being a
[2:10:12] word bride are you reading with me
[2:10:15] when the bible gets back to being a
[2:10:17] white bride
[2:10:18] she
[2:10:19] come on read with me
[2:10:21] she will
[2:10:25] the very words that jesus produced what
[2:10:28] are the works that jesus produced
[2:10:30] number one
[2:10:35] brethren
[2:10:37] he healed the sick
[2:10:39] raise the dead
[2:10:42] someone said turn water into wine
[2:10:44] there is a testimony that a brother gave
[2:10:47] some of you might never ever
[2:10:49] have had this i listened to it from a
[2:10:52] person who was sharing it with me i
[2:10:55] think he was either a witness uh it was
[2:10:57] on the internet
[2:11:00] on the youtube so uh as a minister
[2:11:03] and he he said that uh one day in in the
[2:11:07] in the church in jeffersonville
[2:11:10] in jeffersonville brother barnum
[2:11:12] they were having communion
[2:11:15] and uh
[2:11:16] when finished
[2:11:18] that's right so brother you ever heard
[2:11:20] of the testimony
[2:11:21] yeah and so brother never the pastor
[2:11:25] came close to by the banana i mean the
[2:11:27] ears and told him
[2:11:29] when he's finished
[2:11:31] and of course the people were we are not
[2:11:33] yet you know
[2:11:34] [Music]
[2:11:36] done and there are many more people to
[2:11:38] sleep to have a sip of wine
[2:11:40] and and take the bread
[2:11:42] and so uh
[2:11:44] brother bran i'm told by the naval let
[2:11:47] us pray
[2:11:48] so
[2:11:49] they didn't involve the church in this
[2:11:50] you know everybody was continuing what
[2:11:52] they're doing you know we're there on
[2:11:53] that day we we take the wine and um
[2:11:56] and uh take the bread and wash one
[2:11:58] another's feet while we are praying for
[2:12:00] one another i hope that we'll be able to
[2:12:02] do that soon and so as a church so then
[2:12:06] uh
[2:12:07] a while by the never prayed with the
[2:12:09] banham
[2:12:10] you know
[2:12:13] it is say that
[2:12:15] the witness said that he began to see
[2:12:19] wine you know because there are many
[2:12:20] like
[2:12:22] the glasses we use like many glasses
[2:12:24] small small small very many glasses on a
[2:12:26] tray
[2:12:27] that
[2:12:28] they began to see wine coming up like
[2:12:30] that
[2:12:31] filling up all those glasses amen
[2:12:35] amen
[2:12:37] when the bride will get back to being a
[2:12:40] white bride she will produce the very
[2:12:42] works that jesus produced
[2:12:44] the very very words when he say that the
[2:12:47] things i do
[2:12:49] greater
[2:12:50] things greater than these things you
[2:12:52] will do he never meant that we shall do
[2:12:54] things that are mightier than he did but
[2:12:57] he meant we shall do the things that he
[2:12:59] did but more of them will be reproduced
[2:13:02] in our lives because if it is the same
[2:13:05] christ which was
[2:13:06] in him
[2:13:07] is the same christ in us those very
[2:13:10] works must be here amen so just for you
[2:13:13] who said turn water into wine yeah yeah
[2:13:15] it was
[2:13:16] this until heal the sick will heal the
[2:13:19] sick what else did jesus do come on now
[2:13:22] he raised the dead yeah you will raise
[2:13:25] the dead
[2:13:26] in ethiopia we had one day rise up
[2:13:29] they did they did a party
[2:13:32] in a village they invited us
[2:13:34] said we want to see that pastor who
[2:13:36] raised that lazarus from the dead they
[2:13:38] called him in in america
[2:13:42] okay
[2:13:43] which means the second lazarus the
[2:13:45] entire village the chiefs everybody came
[2:13:47] we have the pictures here some of you
[2:13:49] have showed you some of those pictures
[2:13:50] when i was in a horse and kind of thing
[2:13:52] like that the place that place where
[2:13:54] they come from doesn't even have a a a
[2:13:57] i mean roads that
[2:14:00] can pass so we use horses to get there
[2:14:02] we walked and then we were coming back
[2:14:04] they gave us their horses so
[2:14:06] very very far but
[2:14:08] you know this man
[2:14:10] the entire village said we want to see
[2:14:13] that goal we want to see the people who
[2:14:15] prayed for him we want to see the whole
[2:14:17] village came and i think more not less
[2:14:19] than 10 i think should be about 20 about
[2:14:22] from that very village
[2:14:23] they came all of them who had about a
[2:14:25] hundred people we preached to them the
[2:14:27] message
[2:14:28] hallelujah amen this god still heals the
[2:14:31] sick and raises the dead amen amen
[2:14:35] and also remember jesus saved the
[2:14:37] sinners yes jesus did what
[2:14:41] so does this kill steps in us today oh
[2:14:43] yes do we believe that he's killed some
[2:14:46] sinners
[2:14:47] so if you are a sinner he can still save
[2:14:50] you
[2:14:50] don't starve for me let me just hide
[2:14:52] myself with my appetite of sin
[2:14:54] let me be with it
[2:14:56] until maybe it will go no if you you are
[2:14:58] troubled with the sin you come we will
[2:15:00] pray with you we shall
[2:15:02] the power of christ in us will save you
[2:15:07] when the bride will get back to being a
[2:15:08] white bride she will produce the very
[2:15:11] works that jesus produced the very works
[2:15:13] about the joker
[2:15:15] that jesus produced you shall produce
[2:15:17] do you believe that
[2:15:19] hallelujah let's continue right here
[2:15:21] remember now john the baptist was both
[2:15:23] the prophet and the messenger of his day
[2:15:26] he was filled with the holy ghost from
[2:15:28] his mother's womb
[2:15:29] when he was baptizing in jordan the word
[2:15:31] of god jesus came to him
[2:15:34] the word always comes to the truly
[2:15:36] spirit filled
[2:15:37] that is the evidence of being filled
[2:15:39] with the holy ghost
[2:15:40] that is what jesus said would be the
[2:15:42] evidence
[2:15:43] he said
[2:15:44] and i will pray the father and he will
[2:15:46] send you another comforter that he may
[2:15:49] abide with you forever
[2:15:51] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[2:15:54] cannot receive
[2:15:56] now we know what truth is
[2:15:58] thy word is truth
[2:16:00] john 17 17 be
[2:16:03] again in john 8 43
[2:16:06] why do you not understand my speech even
[2:16:08] because you cannot hear my word
[2:16:11] did you notice that jesus said that the
[2:16:12] world could not receive the holy ghost
[2:16:15] well in this verse i just read neither
[2:16:17] could they receive the word
[2:16:19] why
[2:16:20] because the spirit and the word are one
[2:16:22] and if you have the holy spirit as the
[2:16:24] prophets the word would come to you you
[2:16:26] would receive it
[2:16:28] in john 14 26
[2:16:30] but the comforter which is the holy
[2:16:32] ghost whom the father will send in my
[2:16:33] name he shall teach you all things and
[2:16:36] bring all things to your remembrance
[2:16:39] whatsoever i have said unto you
[2:16:41] here again we find the word coming
[2:16:43] because of the spirit of god
[2:16:45] again in john 16 13
[2:16:48] albeit when he the spirit of truth word
[2:16:50] is come he will guide you into all truth
[2:16:53] thy word is truth and he shall not speak
[2:16:56] of himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[2:16:58] word of god that shall he speak word and
[2:17:02] he will show you things to come
[2:17:04] spirit bringing the word of prophecy
[2:17:07] you know one thing that i love about
[2:17:08] this church edible
[2:17:10] is that
[2:17:11] brother banham doesn't simply pass his
[2:17:13] ideas
[2:17:15] every almost every idea speaks about he
[2:17:18] brings a scripture
[2:17:19] every idea brings a scripture so this is
[2:17:22] not a book
[2:17:24] okay
[2:17:25] it's not a book as in
[2:17:26] a book with ideas but abandoned bringing
[2:17:29] his opinions like all the books we have
[2:17:31] in the market uh
[2:17:34] written by christian
[2:17:36] pastors and evangelists and stuff like
[2:17:38] that
[2:17:39] the church edge book
[2:17:41] is not like that
[2:17:42] the church edge book
[2:17:44] uh is uh
[2:17:46] a book that throws like a
[2:17:49] more like a commenter
[2:17:51] a commenter you know like a bible
[2:17:53] commentary
[2:17:54] it doesn't like bring an idea
[2:17:56] but it only throws light on this very
[2:17:59] scriptures we have
[2:18:00] so
[2:18:01] that's why we always say we have no book
[2:18:03] but
[2:18:04] bible bible if you're going to read
[2:18:06] anything extra like we are doing right
[2:18:08] now it is really helping us to study
[2:18:11] the bible
[2:18:12] that's why we're not calling this a
[2:18:13] message saturday because the message is
[2:18:15] not the root here what's the root here
[2:18:17] the bible therefore whatever we are
[2:18:19] doing we are studying the bible
[2:18:21] we are getting to know christ more so
[2:18:23] this message is not really another like
[2:18:25] i hear people saying the bible and the
[2:18:27] message please stop that
[2:18:30] there is only one thing the word of god
[2:18:33] and the word of god comes to us in every
[2:18:35] generation and therefore what we have
[2:18:37] received in this generation we have it
[2:18:38] 1200 tips plus
[2:18:41] what is it it's the word of god
[2:18:43] so this message is really meant to help
[2:18:46] us fall in love with god with christ
[2:18:48] with the bible
[2:18:49] so the bible is our absolute hallelujah
[2:18:53] and therefore the message is our
[2:18:55] absolute interpretation
[2:18:58] of the bible i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm
[2:19:01] stealing that
[2:19:02] a phrase from your father by the
[2:19:04] political you know he's the one who said
[2:19:06] that on the ministers for you that the
[2:19:08] bible
[2:19:09] the message is the absolute
[2:19:12] interpretation of the bible in our
[2:19:14] generation amen
[2:19:17] that's like paul's message in his day
[2:19:20] was the absolute interpretation of the
[2:19:24] bible that they had at that time
[2:19:27] you know they had the bible and they
[2:19:28] were like oh you know but we should
[2:19:30] decide you know peter was saying i know
[2:19:32] you know the way i see it we should
[2:19:34] circumcise even we should not eat this
[2:19:36] and that even we should not by the poor
[2:19:38] say don't know
[2:19:40] we can do other things we don't need to
[2:19:42] circumcise whether you're circumcised or
[2:19:44] not no problem whether you eat this or
[2:19:46] no problem now grace has come we are no
[2:19:48] longer under a school master
[2:19:51] what was that it was the absolute
[2:19:54] interpretation of the word of god of the
[2:19:57] bible at that time hallelujah actually
[2:20:00] the word bible is not in the bible
[2:20:04] so when you use bible use it carefully
[2:20:08] the the what the thing here is the word
[2:20:10] of god yes hallelujah so because bible
[2:20:14] actually means a collection of books
[2:20:17] hey did you know that
[2:20:19] bible means a collection of books
[2:20:22] so now
[2:20:24] that's why the catholics have 81 books
[2:20:27] and we have 66 books someone now wants
[2:20:30] to know the difference
[2:20:33] anyone wants to know the difference
[2:20:35] oh you already know the difference all
[2:20:37] right
[2:20:38] so
[2:20:39] ask yourself why don't we have the
[2:20:41] number that they have
[2:20:43] because
[2:20:44] we believe that the holy spirit inspired
[2:20:47] each and every book that is in our bible
[2:20:50] yes by men
[2:20:52] to write them and also by men who picked
[2:20:55] them and put it in the canon
[2:20:57] and number number number three there are
[2:20:58] very many reasons number number two this
[2:21:01] bible was hated by the roman catholic
[2:21:03] church and they tried to
[2:21:04] to completely wipe it from the face of
[2:21:06] the earth
[2:21:07] they tried to burn as many as possible
[2:21:09] they couldn't finish them
[2:21:11] it survived the fires this kjv bible
[2:21:14] it survived a lot of things survived the
[2:21:16] water floods it survived everything that
[2:21:19] could survive but it survived
[2:21:21] that's another sign it is
[2:21:23] the
[2:21:24] authentic book
[2:21:27] then also
[2:21:28] this bible
[2:21:30] it has 66 books
[2:21:33] and when you check the prophecy of
[2:21:35] isaiah it has how many chapters
[2:21:38] 66 chapters and actually when you read
[2:21:40] through those chapters almost every
[2:21:42] chapter is speaking of every book in the
[2:21:45] bible
[2:21:46] there are very many things that you can
[2:21:48] be able to look at and surely say ah
[2:21:49] this bible is authentic it is the
[2:21:52] absolute truth
[2:21:53] therefore every man of god who will come
[2:21:55] in every generation his word his
[2:21:58] preaching
[2:21:59] will
[2:22:01] will
[2:22:02] um
[2:22:03] open the people of that generation their
[2:22:05] eyes to clearly see what god was saying
[2:22:07] in the generations before us
[2:22:09] so the interpretation the messengers
[2:22:11] these seven messengers the
[2:22:13] interpretation of scripture is the
[2:22:15] perfect
[2:22:17] uh and i need to emphasize this before
[2:22:19] you go back to the reading it is the
[2:22:21] perfect
[2:22:24] interpretation
[2:22:25] of scripture or of the word of god in
[2:22:28] that generation
[2:22:30] did you hear that yes
[2:22:32] now we need to have
[2:22:34] a standard honestly
[2:22:37] we need to have a standard
[2:22:38] what is our standard today
[2:22:43] yeah i believe that do you have a bible
[2:22:45] give me a bible give me your bible
[2:22:48] brother you have this bible
[2:22:50] this bible is our standard right yes
[2:22:55] can i surprise you
[2:22:58] this same bible that is our standard
[2:23:04] is also owned by the anglican church
[2:23:07] the same bible
[2:23:10] did you know that yes
[2:23:11] this same bible which is our standard
[2:23:14] is also owned by the pentecostals
[2:23:18] this same bible which is our standard
[2:23:21] is also owned by sdas
[2:23:25] this same bible is owned
[2:23:27] owned by
[2:23:28] you know all those groups
[2:23:30] jehovah witness the mormons
[2:23:34] and what have you they have this bible
[2:23:37] and they also call it their word
[2:23:40] and they read it and they claim to
[2:23:42] believe it
[2:23:43] but the difference only is their
[2:23:46] interpretation their interpretation of
[2:23:48] the same bible
[2:23:50] so
[2:23:51] all the denominations you have today you
[2:23:54] have them because they interpret this
[2:23:55] bible in the way they understand it
[2:23:59] now if we
[2:24:01] are doing the same thing they are doing
[2:24:04] it only makes us another group
[2:24:07] another nomination
[2:24:09] but what i want to tell you we are more
[2:24:11] than that
[2:24:12] hallelujah because we have a standard
[2:24:16] for this generation
[2:24:17] oh hallelujah
[2:24:19] i need to preach on that one day
[2:24:22] we have a standard for this generation
[2:24:24] sure like
[2:24:26] like noah was a standard
[2:24:29] no other standard nowhere himself he was
[2:24:31] the standard his word was a sure why the
[2:24:34] prophecy oh yes in almost 3 7 what does
[2:24:37] he say surely the lord god speak it with
[2:24:40] me sure the lord god will do nothing but
[2:24:42] he revealed his secrets to his servants
[2:24:45] they
[2:24:46] they
[2:24:48] hallelujah so if god used a prophet in
[2:24:50] the days of noah
[2:24:52] before a major thing happened on the
[2:24:54] world he will continue to use a prophet
[2:24:57] every day because that is his pattern
[2:25:00] therefore in every generation before
[2:25:02] destruction or before the end before
[2:25:04] some major thing happens
[2:25:06] god must send a prophet
[2:25:08] with the word of god
[2:25:10] which is going to be the absolute
[2:25:12] interpretation of the word of god for
[2:25:14] that generation
[2:25:15] hallelujah in the days of moses that was
[2:25:18] moses in the days of paul that was born
[2:25:21] in the days of martin luther that was
[2:25:23] martin luther in the days of uh of of
[2:25:27] noah that was noah
[2:25:29] william that was william branham now you
[2:25:31] find that many people even who claim to
[2:25:33] believe this message will have their own
[2:25:35] little you know understandings of the
[2:25:38] the same word which they say they claim
[2:25:40] to believe but let me tell you if
[2:25:42] brother banham
[2:25:44] saw it this way and i believe you
[2:25:46] believe is the prophet of this
[2:25:48] generation you must take
[2:25:50] his interpretation of it yes not your
[2:25:52] interpretation of it why because god did
[2:25:55] not send you as the elijah
[2:25:57] you have the same spirit by the bottom
[2:25:59] heart
[2:25:59] but you are not the elijah of this
[2:26:01] generation
[2:26:02] can i hear you say amen
[2:26:05] you are not the elijah of this
[2:26:06] generation but you have the same holy
[2:26:08] spirit that's why you can still preach
[2:26:10] under the same anointing that he
[2:26:11] preached under and the same
[2:26:12] manifestation can also manifest even
[2:26:15] much more than it was in the days of
[2:26:16] battle
[2:26:17] hallelujah why because the same jesus
[2:26:19] christ is still here on the scene
[2:26:21] so
[2:26:22] some people also take that thought and
[2:26:23] they say so that's why you must not
[2:26:25] preach again because revelation comes to
[2:26:26] prophet hey hey please
[2:26:29] we must preach
[2:26:30] because the same old gods he had we have
[2:26:34] hallelujah someone said you know all
[2:26:36] these titles of brother banham he
[2:26:38] preached count down come on you have a
[2:26:39] translator give me more come on count
[2:26:41] down count down
[2:26:43] hold the ball attraction
[2:26:45] prisoner come on fast
[2:26:48] speak to the rock
[2:26:49] believe it's not this
[2:26:51] come on now
[2:26:53] this is the time
[2:26:56] everybody speak with your brain coming
[2:26:58] back
[2:27:06] you people some of you have not spoken
[2:27:07] even one message and there are 1200
[2:27:10] messages what have you been feeding on
[2:27:12] are you not the ones who have been
[2:27:13] listening to this worldly music
[2:27:16] hallelujah
[2:27:18] all these titles so someone was saying
[2:27:20] you know what
[2:27:22] those are the only
[2:27:24] subtitles a picture can preach from so
[2:27:26] don't come and tell us i am going to
[2:27:28] preach on the power of femoral agents
[2:27:30] who are you to talk about are you the
[2:27:32] prophet of this generation did the
[2:27:33] inspiration come true i said oh yeah i
[2:27:35] know that the word of god comes to what
[2:27:38] to a prophet but the word of god has
[2:27:39] already come to a prophet my generation
[2:27:41] whatever you're preaching we are
[2:27:42] preaching
[2:27:44] we are preaching within that inspiration
[2:27:46] i'm not bringing a new inspiration it's
[2:27:48] the same is but the holy spirit is
[2:27:50] inspiring me still within the message of
[2:27:52] the hour but paul said about him said i
[2:27:54] preached what paul preached
[2:27:57] but he never preached
[2:27:59] the titles of paul
[2:28:02] today i'm going to speak on the letter
[2:28:04] to the corinthians
[2:28:07] the first late actually
[2:28:11] today my title is galatians we'll be
[2:28:14] waiting to you because it is what will
[2:28:15] say you understand
[2:28:18] the holy spirit can inspire you to even
[2:28:21] breach another title
[2:28:23] as long as your inspiration agrees with
[2:28:26] the word of god for your day
[2:28:28] hallelujah amen praise the name of the
[2:28:30] lord amen also also preaching the title
[2:28:33] that the prophet has preached is not a
[2:28:34] scene
[2:28:35] so you must blast these things
[2:28:38] when a brother comes next time and say
[2:28:39] today i'm going to speak on preach speak
[2:28:42] to the wrong
[2:28:43] brother what is your own inspiration no
[2:28:45] no no please stop this the holy spirit
[2:28:48] can move whichever he wants to move no
[2:28:50] limitations hallelujah
[2:28:52] the message is the truth the message is
[2:28:54] the word of god
[2:28:55] hallelujah by the time i left ethiopia
[2:28:58] everybody we had one phrase with you
[2:29:00] everybody was really loving the message
[2:29:02] is true
[2:29:03] the message is true
[2:29:05] and they usually was saying that because
[2:29:07] of how they saw the things that was
[2:29:09] being preached to them the first year
[2:29:12] their second year their third year and
[2:29:14] they saw those things coming to pass in
[2:29:16] a manifestation
[2:29:18] hallelujah then they had the right to
[2:29:20] say the message is true
[2:29:22] hallelujah and you too when god begins
[2:29:25] to manifest in your life then you'll be
[2:29:26] able to say the message is true
[2:29:28] hallelujah
[2:29:30] praise the name of the lord amen
[2:29:32] all right let us continue here a little
[2:29:34] bit
[2:29:38] i want you to note very carefully that
[2:29:40] jesus did not say that the evidence of
[2:29:41] being baptized with the holy ghost was
[2:29:43] speaking in tongues interpreting
[2:29:46] prophesying or shouting and dancing
[2:29:48] he said the evidence would be that you
[2:29:50] would be in the truth
[2:29:52] you would be in the word of god for your
[2:29:54] age
[2:29:55] evidence has to do with receiving that
[2:29:57] word
[2:29:58] hallelujah
[2:30:00] oh you need to annoy that in your book
[2:30:02] hallelujah amen i love this part
[2:30:05] hallelujah
[2:30:07] now of course this part can be
[2:30:09] misunderstood by some people who are
[2:30:11] cannot
[2:30:12] i want you to note very carefully that
[2:30:15] jesus did not say that the evidence of
[2:30:17] being baptized with the holy ghost was
[2:30:19] speaking in tongues interpreting
[2:30:21] prophesying or shouting in and dancing
[2:30:23] can i read it again yes yes and when i
[2:30:26] read this right you say amen if i don't
[2:30:28] read it right you keep quiet
[2:30:30] or you say no
[2:30:31] i want you to note very carefully that
[2:30:33] jesus did not say that the evidence of
[2:30:35] being baptized with the holy ghost was
[2:30:37] speaking in times interpreting
[2:30:39] prophesying or shouting and dancing and
[2:30:41] therefore those things should not
[2:30:42] manifest or manga you
[2:30:45] [Music]
[2:30:47] praise the name of the lord
[2:30:48] this is how some people read it
[2:30:51] this is how some people read it
[2:30:53] and there are for those things you
[2:30:54] should not
[2:30:55] that's how they read it
[2:30:58] what brother balaam is trying to do he's
[2:30:59] not attacking these things
[2:31:01] he's not attacking the manifestation of
[2:31:03] the holy ghost but he's only trying to
[2:31:06] say look here that is not the evidence
[2:31:09] that you have the holy ghost
[2:31:11] that is only the evidence that you have
[2:31:13] the manifestation of the gifts of the
[2:31:15] holy spirit hallelujah
[2:31:18] but manifestation
[2:31:21] can be impersonated
[2:31:23] yes
[2:31:24] but he says what is the evidence well as
[2:31:28] much as before we do that as much as it
[2:31:29] can be impersonated
[2:31:31] it doesn't mean that the right one
[2:31:33] shouldn't have it
[2:31:35] the right must have it
[2:31:37] actually the right one should have it
[2:31:38] before the other one who is
[2:31:39] impersonating it
[2:31:41] that's how many times you see in the
[2:31:42] church you can find two people dancing
[2:31:44] in the spirit one shouting another and
[2:31:46] shouting and you can surely know this
[2:31:47] one is an impersonator this one is
[2:31:49] filled with the holy ghost
[2:31:51] you can design them i've seen them in
[2:31:53] the years of ministry i've seen it yes
[2:31:55] brother i was reading something
[2:31:57] yesterday in the message debating on the
[2:32:00] times sometimes yes and
[2:32:02] the prophet was saying
[2:32:04] that if i give you this book
[2:32:08] and it is my gift i have not given you
[2:32:11] myself yes so you can have my gift yes
[2:32:14] you don't have me yes that's better you
[2:32:17] can have the gifts of the holy spirit
[2:32:20] yet
[2:32:21] yet you don't have the holy spirit yes
[2:32:23] that's
[2:32:24] very absolutely true you can have the
[2:32:26] gifts of the holy spirit but without
[2:32:28] having
[2:32:29] the holy spirit
[2:32:31] so what should we do should we put all
[2:32:33] our worry
[2:32:35] should we put all our worry on
[2:32:39] on
[2:32:40] fearing whether we have counterfeit
[2:32:42] gifts
[2:32:43] that's what the problem that's the
[2:32:44] mistake many believers have done
[2:32:47] that brother banham did not speak it
[2:32:49] through the genuine believers he was
[2:32:51] speaking to the pentecostals yes
[2:32:53] because they were impersonating the gift
[2:32:55] of the holy spirit
[2:32:57] but to the believers who have already
[2:32:59] received the evidence what is the
[2:33:01] evidence
[2:33:03] he's saying that the evidence would be
[2:33:04] that he would be in
[2:33:06] the truth the truth you will be in the
[2:33:09] word of god for your work
[2:33:12] please come on join me now for your what
[2:33:16] evidence has to do with receiving
[2:33:19] that word now if you have received that
[2:33:22] word of your day if you have received
[2:33:23] that interpretation absolute
[2:33:25] interpretation of the word of god for
[2:33:26] your day that is the evidence hallelujah
[2:33:28] that you are in christ
[2:33:31] but indeed if you are in christ that
[2:33:34] manifestation must follow
[2:33:36] for if it doesn't follow then you lie
[2:33:39] you are not in christ
[2:33:41] when jesus christ was here on earth he
[2:33:44] said
[2:33:44] that
[2:33:45] you
[2:33:46] you said that your father was abraham
[2:33:48] but actually you are lying
[2:33:51] why would be would he be able to say
[2:33:52] that he said you can't believe me in the
[2:33:54] world and also you can't believe the
[2:33:56] very words the manifestation you are
[2:33:58] refusing to believe the word and you are
[2:34:00] refusing the manifestation verify
[2:34:02] because of this i know you are of your
[2:34:04] father the devil
[2:34:06] can you imagine yes so those two things
[2:34:09] must always be in your life
[2:34:11] and this is what the church is trying to
[2:34:13] say all through
[2:34:15] major thing two things the true word of
[2:34:18] god
[2:34:19] and the manifestations yes
[2:34:21] if there is no manifestation what you
[2:34:23] are preaching is not the true word of
[2:34:24] god we want to see the manifestation
[2:34:26] brother
[2:34:28] i love brother charlotte the way he said
[2:34:29] that sometimes there are churches you
[2:34:31] find them the zero temperature
[2:34:35] there is no life there is not no life of
[2:34:37] movement you know
[2:34:40] imagine if you were in the bush there
[2:34:42] and there there is no life of mobile
[2:34:44] there is no any movement
[2:34:46] all the grass is just in one place there
[2:34:49] is no birds there is nothing queen or
[2:34:52] speaking or waving there is no wind
[2:34:54] everything is a standstill
[2:34:56] you would be like oh where am i am i in
[2:34:58] here you'll be like what is happening
[2:35:01] even nature itself doesn't have zero
[2:35:03] temperatures but you find in the
[2:35:05] churches of so-called believers
[2:35:08] our churches your churches
[2:35:11] of course when i say you said i mean you
[2:35:12] you you the person you i'm meaning you
[2:35:15] nothing because there's no domination
[2:35:16] here
[2:35:18] very cold
[2:35:20] very cold even and i meant to take
[2:35:22] another man out of your heart it's like
[2:35:23] as if
[2:35:25] you are acting like as an officer yes
[2:35:27] like the brother is trying to
[2:35:28] demonstrate it
[2:35:29] yeah
[2:35:30] the person is pitching and sweating and
[2:35:33] you know and you are like
[2:35:37] just raising up your hand eh i guess you
[2:35:40] know very very cool huh
[2:35:42] but how's the service the service was
[2:35:44] cool
[2:35:46] let me tell you that's not the church of
[2:35:48] the living god hallelujah
[2:35:50] the church of the living god there is
[2:35:52] happiness that is running around and
[2:35:53] shouting there is speaking in tongues
[2:35:55] there is prophet signs there is there is
[2:35:57] jubilee
[2:35:58] hallelujah
[2:35:59] that's how the church of christ ought to
[2:36:01] be
[2:36:03] if if you've settled for something less
[2:36:05] than that you've settled for something
[2:36:07] wrong oh yeah hallelujah
[2:36:10] if you read the church in first
[2:36:11] corinthians 14 37
[2:36:14] if any man think himself to be a prophet
[2:36:16] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[2:36:19] the things i write unto you are the
[2:36:20] commandments of the lord
[2:36:22] now see that
[2:36:23] the proof of the indwelling spirit was
[2:36:25] to acknowledge and follow what god's
[2:36:27] prophet gave for his age as he set the
[2:36:29] church in order
[2:36:30] paul had to say to those who claimed
[2:36:32] another revelation verse 36
[2:36:35] what came the word of god out from you
[2:36:37] or came it unto you only the evidence of
[2:36:40] a spirit-filled christian believer is
[2:36:42] not to produce the truth word but to
[2:36:44] receive the truth word and to believe it
[2:36:47] and obey it
[2:36:53] hallelujah can i play that again
[2:36:56] all right i need to play that again
[2:36:59] and i need to highlight it here for you
[2:37:01] to see it clear
[2:37:03] all right now is that again the proof of
[2:37:05] the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge
[2:37:07] and follow what god's prophet gave for
[2:37:09] his age as he set the church in order
[2:37:12] paul had to say to those who claimed
[2:37:14] another revelation verse 36
[2:37:17] what came the word of god out from you
[2:37:19] or came it unto you only the evidence of
[2:37:22] a spirit-filled christian believer is
[2:37:23] not to produce the truth word but to
[2:37:26] receive the truth word and to believe
[2:37:28] and obey it
[2:37:31] [Music]
[2:37:36] hallelujah
[2:37:37] amen all these things i'm reading to you
[2:37:41] all these things are what
[2:37:42] and we are sharing i'm not trying to say
[2:37:45] you produce it
[2:37:47] no one can produce it
[2:37:49] hallelujah it is a christ to produce it
[2:37:52] but if christ is not in you and you try
[2:37:55] to produce it that's what we call
[2:37:56] impersonation
[2:37:58] now you know what is in pentecost
[2:38:02] now you know
[2:38:04] because if they don't believe the word
[2:38:05] of their age if they have not received
[2:38:07] the true word of god tell me how calm
[2:38:10] they have those manifestations
[2:38:13] how come
[2:38:17] tell me
[2:38:18] how does it happen
[2:38:22] that is
[2:38:23] true impersonations
[2:38:26] because
[2:38:27] there is no way
[2:38:28] you can produce the life of the word
[2:38:31] if you have not received the word
[2:38:34] the evidence of the of a spirit-filled
[2:38:36] christian believer
[2:38:38] is not to produce the truth the word to
[2:38:41] produce
[2:38:42] the word to produce the word means to
[2:38:46] to bring it to pass to make it happen
[2:38:49] it is not you to do that
[2:38:51] but yours is receive the truth the word
[2:38:55] and to obey
[2:38:56] and to believe it
[2:38:58] to believe it and to obey the two
[2:38:59] different things
[2:39:01] you believe it
[2:39:02] by accepting it you obey it by
[2:39:05] practicing it amen
[2:39:06] hallelujah
[2:39:08] period the rest is automatic
[2:39:12] he himself will produce the lights
[2:39:15] hallelujah
[2:39:16] he himself will produce the
[2:39:17] manifestations he himself will produce
[2:39:19] the gifts he himself will produce the
[2:39:21] power
[2:39:23] he himself will produce all those things
[2:39:24] if he promises in his word remember it
[2:39:27] is not you that promises it is a ham
[2:39:30] that promised those things
[2:39:32] when he says that these signs shall
[2:39:34] follow them that believe
[2:39:35] in my name they shall cast out demons in
[2:39:37] my name they shall pray for the sick and
[2:39:39] they shall recover what does it mean
[2:39:42] in my name they shall do those things
[2:39:44] are you going to produce it no no
[2:39:47] they shall preach and the people shall
[2:39:49] believe are you going to save them no
[2:39:51] but what you do you believe the word and
[2:39:53] you obey
[2:39:54] the rest it is to produce itself some
[2:39:56] people get worried oh no me i can't even
[2:39:58] talk a trunk you can't even do it i
[2:40:00] can't even sing i can't even do that i

[2:40:03] when i begin singing it's like you know
[2:40:06] what you know it cracks it does this and
[2:40:08] that

[2:40:09] yourself do do two things believe the
[2:40:12] one and obey it
[2:40:13] believe the word and practice do the
[2:40:15] things don't just be a believer not a
[2:40:17] doer they always say

[2:40:23] i do what you have had practice it in
[2:40:26] your life

[2:40:31] fears happening hallelujah the tree it
[2:40:35] only has one thing to do to obey and to
[2:40:38] believe what god has meant for it what
[2:40:40] is it

[2:40:43] tree will not worry oh now you are
[2:40:44] planted with me here where will i get
[2:40:46] water my roots are going to suffer even
[2:40:48] how can i bear fruit
[2:40:51] no
[2:40:52] it is only planted once it is planted in
[2:40:54] the good ground
[2:40:55] it is automatic when the rain comes
[2:40:57] hallelujah that the roots will push down
[2:41:00] push down and it is automatic the fruits
[2:41:01] will come anyhow
[2:41:03] hallelujah so those fruits of the spirit
[2:41:05] will come anyhow those gifts where
[2:41:07] people will take and eat and enjoy from
[2:41:09] you
[2:41:10] that taste that sweet love that will be
[2:41:12] around you will come automatically as
[2:41:14] long as
[2:41:15] you are planted in good ground
[2:41:18] hallelujah if the word of god is planted
[2:41:20] in good ground the ground of your heart
[2:41:22] whereby you have believed it and
[2:41:23] deceived it some ground is rocky rocky i
[2:41:26] tell you it is like on mars
[2:41:28] some people he's like i don't know he's
[2:41:30] mass rocky
[2:41:33] someone help me who has ever been to
[2:41:34] mars
[2:41:39] some people's had
[2:41:40] some people's hearts
[2:41:42] some people's hearts are very very lucky
[2:41:44] yeah they're like mountain ranges yeah
[2:41:47] they're like mountain rings on a
[2:41:48] mountain elgin or something very very
[2:41:50] rocky whereby the world of god can't
[2:41:52] even find anywhere you just plant it
[2:41:54] there it just goes through some rocks
[2:41:56] and falls down there and birds eat it
[2:41:58] you know but i love those people whereby
[2:42:01] your heart is i have that very good long
[2:42:04] spiritual soil hallelujah whereby when
[2:42:07] the world is planted if you are sure it
[2:42:09] is going to come out when it is planted
[2:42:12] and the rain comes that's the rain the
[2:42:13] anointing of the holocaust where you
[2:42:15] know those times
[2:42:16] you know come around here and sing and
[2:42:18] worship god that is it is a must that
[2:42:20] something must react in you hallelujah
[2:42:22] why because the word was planted in a
[2:42:24] good ground amen when others can't
[2:42:26] understand you you know as i say oh when
[2:42:28] i get happy i sing and they shout
[2:42:31] the devil don't believe it i see
[2:42:33] but i'm filled with the spirit there
[2:42:35] isn't a doubt and that is what the
[2:42:37] matter with me
[2:42:39] you know whereby when you do that people
[2:42:41] are like what's wrong with him it's just
[2:42:42] shout it's just too loud you know too
[2:42:44] loud unnecessarily
[2:42:46] we talk about the thought but you see it
[2:42:48] only shows the type of soil the what is
[2:42:51] the word is the one but what type of
[2:42:53] soil has been planted
[2:42:56] as the word been planted in
[2:42:59] what type is your soil brother and
[2:43:00] sister what type is your soil
[2:43:03] if your soil is good
[2:43:04] if your soil is long
[2:43:06] long soil that favors plants
[2:43:09] then it is going to bear the fruits
[2:43:12] these things we are reading about it's
[2:43:13] going to happen without forcing it
[2:43:16] without pushing it without having to
[2:43:18] first put you in a meeting rather sister
[2:43:20] neither sit in the meeting and give you
[2:43:22] concerning if it comes to that it means
[2:43:24] your soul is still having a problem
[2:43:26] that's why he said i'm going to fast the
[2:43:28] first thing that god does oh hallelujah
[2:43:30] he says i'm going to change the type of
[2:43:31] yesterday
[2:43:33] pastor where do you get that from the
[2:43:34] book of ezekiel he says i will give you
[2:43:37] a new heart
[2:43:39] that is your song
[2:43:40] that's the heart the status of your
[2:43:41] heart
[2:43:43] you cannot receive this word with your
[2:43:44] own heart you can't if you still have
[2:43:46] your own stony heart you can't receive
[2:43:48] the word you know he has to first give
[2:43:50] you the heart of flesh i'll give you a
[2:43:51] new heart
[2:43:53] that is what each and every believer
[2:43:55] needs to have because we are born in
[2:43:56] this world with a rocky hat
[2:43:59] with the heart of rocks so you have to
[2:44:01] first be changed whereby when you hear
[2:44:04] the word of god god will give you a new
[2:44:05] heart it will just come in here how will
[2:44:07] it come i don't know but somehow
[2:44:09] it will come in and the other one will
[2:44:11] just be done over with and when you
[2:44:13] receive the new heart then that's a very
[2:44:16] good ground for god to begin working on
[2:44:17] you hallelujah
[2:44:19] praise the name of the lord
[2:44:20] sister
[2:44:22] peace
[2:44:23] was it you that said that you didn't
[2:44:24] have a desire for the word you didn't
[2:44:26] have the desire for those things but now
[2:44:29] what is the percentage of the desire in
[2:44:30] you now
[2:44:32] be be honest be honest don't don't you
[2:44:34] don't have to say anything to prove what
[2:44:35] i'm saying just tell me the truth what's
[2:44:37] the desire in you now what's what
[2:44:38] percentage
[2:44:40] between before this study
[2:44:43] and since we started what's the
[2:44:45] percentage now
[2:44:49] what percentage is it at on a scale of
[2:44:51] one to a hundred where are you
[2:44:57] like 40 there you are not even above
[2:44:59] average yet but you are trying you the
[2:45:02] desire is there and there now
[2:45:04] actually you you could not even walk
[2:45:05] there before but now you can walk from
[2:45:08] home to here
[2:45:09] what pushes you to work here
[2:45:11] is it the food or is it the people is it
[2:45:13] what
[2:45:15] now i wanted you to see for yourself
[2:45:18] that's what god did for you you see that
[2:45:21] moment when the power of god struck you
[2:45:22] down there don't think that it was where
[2:45:24] you making it up
[2:45:27] did you even know what happened to you
[2:45:29] that was there was something leaving you
[2:45:31] at that very moment
[2:45:32] and something was coming in you
[2:45:34] now
[2:45:35] do not ever think that now i'm filled
[2:45:38] with the holy ghost because that
[2:45:39] happened no
[2:45:41] but it was the holy spirit working on
[2:45:43] you you know he does an operation it's a
[2:45:45] phases
[2:45:46] what was happening he was taking out the
[2:45:48] other old stony heart and putting in the
[2:45:52] new heart
[2:45:53] now that was an operation that the holy
[2:45:55] spirit was working on
[2:45:56] i'm using as an example
[2:45:58] now that
[2:46:00] new heart when it comes in you
[2:46:03] it gives you the desire
[2:46:06] for the word
[2:46:08] whereby you cannot listen here when you
[2:46:09] hear you cannot listen you can settle in
[2:46:11] you can say you think about it you give
[2:46:13] it reason all right you you you feel
[2:46:15] like there's something that is touching
[2:46:16] you you know but then before maybe you
[2:46:18] are hearing this is always in my time
[2:46:23] you know but when you now in the heart
[2:46:26] amen is change the word begins to settle
[2:46:29] in yes
[2:46:30] and when it begins to settle in god also
[2:46:32] now will give you a new word
[2:46:34] in your spirit you know what
[2:46:36] any what
[2:46:37] when you receive any spirit
[2:46:39] it is time
[2:46:41] for god to begin moving hallelujah
[2:46:44] when you begin to see someone with a new
[2:46:46] speech but the bottom actually says that
[2:46:47] when you receive a new spirit
[2:46:49] it makes you
[2:46:52] agree agreeable with the holy spirit
[2:46:55] then your spirit is not
[2:46:57] the holy spirit
[2:46:58] it is your spirit okay
[2:47:01] it is your new spirit because you were
[2:47:03] born with the holy spirit that holy
[2:47:05] spirit of yours eh but the bottom
[2:47:07] actually says that you cannot even live
[2:47:08] with yourself
[2:47:10] that holy spirit of yours
[2:47:12] you can barely live with yourself that's
[2:47:14] why some people commit suicide some
[2:47:16] people kill themselves because they have
[2:47:19] the old
[2:47:20] spirit whereby they feel bad about
[2:47:23] everything they feel depressions all the
[2:47:25] time they you know even even you know
[2:47:28] it's just like you sometimes your legs
[2:47:29] can hit one another what is that that's
[2:47:31] the kind of the old spirit you had you
[2:47:34] know you can't even agree with yourself
[2:47:36] how can you now agree with others let
[2:47:38] alone the holy spirit
[2:47:40] but if you have a new spirit
[2:47:42] you agree with whatever the holy spirit
[2:47:45] brings down on the table
[2:47:47] when the word of god comes in such power
[2:47:49] it will bring you the first sense that
[2:47:51] they leave the holy spirit in the room
[2:47:52] before others
[2:47:54] hallelujah
[2:47:55] when others are still
[2:47:57] trying to find out what is happening
[2:47:59] you're already in tears and crying and
[2:48:01] worshiping god and you know you're
[2:48:02] already praised and within it
[2:48:05] in the middle of it
[2:48:07] you find people like that beginning to
[2:48:09] prophesy and to speak tongues and bust
[2:48:11] out and shout and what is happening
[2:48:14] they have a new spirit
[2:48:16] hallelujah
[2:48:18] by the time you receive that god has
[2:48:20] already paved the way and made it
[2:48:23] made it enough for you
[2:48:25] to receive him now
[2:48:27] you remember the house of canadians they
[2:48:30] already have received a new spirit
[2:48:32] to the extent that all the two was for a
[2:48:35] man of god who was having the holy ghost
[2:48:38] to preach and anointed someone and while
[2:48:40] he was preaching their new spirit
[2:48:43] easily captured that word believed it
[2:48:46] received it lived it
[2:48:48] and they received christ himself from
[2:48:50] the throne of their heart hallelujah
[2:48:53] and then even the manifestation
[2:48:55] came immediately they started to speak
[2:48:57] in tongues and to prophesy that's the
[2:48:59] house of canadians and they said ah
[2:49:01] these men who are speaking tongues and
[2:49:03] unlike us who have received the holy
[2:49:04] spirit like us
[2:49:06] then let us let us try to baptize them
[2:49:07] we see if it is the true holy spirit you
[2:49:09] will agree with everyone if what you
[2:49:11] have received is the spirit of god and
[2:49:13] it is not agreeing with the word please
[2:49:14] it's not the spirit of god
[2:49:16] he said please can you come and baptize
[2:49:18] you said they didn't say our praise can
[2:49:19] you leave us alone because we have the
[2:49:20] holy spirit but they said our men take
[2:49:23] us back
[2:49:34] and shouting they went in the water yeah
[2:49:36] i don't know if they never started some
[2:49:38] water because they were already
[2:49:39] energized and
[2:49:41] in you know very very high temperatures
[2:49:43] of the holy ghost and they went and
[2:49:45] baptized them and went out again
[2:49:46] hallelujah that's the kind of god we
[2:49:48] serve
[2:49:50] and that god is alive
[2:49:52] that god is leaving and that god is here
[2:49:55] hallelujah
[2:49:56] praise the name of the lord
[2:49:58] and so
[2:49:59] what we have learned today
[2:50:01] is that pegamos
[2:50:02] was
[2:50:03] the third church age
[2:50:05] and as we get deeper into it you'll
[2:50:08] realize that uh it was not only that god
[2:50:11] who was working with them
[2:50:13] uh
[2:50:14] with by the way well other thing i
[2:50:16] wanted you to see is that
[2:50:17] the great the greater the scene or the
[2:50:20] darkness the greater the light
[2:50:24] hallelujah
[2:50:25] you see how
[2:50:27] darkness was
[2:50:28] at this time
[2:50:30] in pegamos
[2:50:31] and how god was moving and working in
[2:50:34] martin
[2:50:36] and these are the saints why
[2:50:39] because these are they that believed in
[2:50:41] god and the manifestation of the spirit
[2:50:44] all through
[2:50:45] all through there was a little church it
[2:50:47] was not big it was small but they
[2:50:49] believed in the word they held on to the
[2:50:51] truth
[2:50:53] you know
[2:50:54] and so it doesn't matter god does not
[2:50:55] work with numbers
[2:50:57] god works
[2:50:59] with those that believe his word
[2:51:01] no matter how many they are and
[2:51:05] it's only in the believer's
[2:51:06] churches where i have seen
[2:51:08] people preach their heart out even when
[2:51:10] they have three people
[2:51:12] 20
[2:51:13] or maybe like here
[2:51:15] 30 40 50 100 2000 you preach the same
[2:51:19] way
[2:51:20] hallelujah
[2:51:22] you know
[2:51:23] not because the people are so many today
[2:51:25] i'm going to be announcing so much
[2:51:28] the reason why they are like that
[2:51:29] because they know when that happens they
[2:51:31] are going to to open more pockets
[2:51:34] so they will they will be more anointed
[2:51:38] by the god of their stomach
[2:51:40] because they want to have more
[2:51:42] but in this message whether you have one
[2:51:43] soul or two souls you preach the same
[2:51:46] way
[2:51:47] whether or not someone is seeing you you
[2:51:49] live the same life
[2:51:50] because it's not like a makeup you're
[2:51:53] not living for anybody
[2:51:55] you're living for your life to go to
[2:51:57] heaven your soul to win the kingdom of
[2:51:59] god
[2:52:00] so you don't live another life here and
[2:52:02] another life in your backyard it's the
[2:52:04] same life
[2:52:05] because the same christ and you desire
[2:52:07] the same thing
[2:52:09] praise the name of god amen hallelujah
[2:52:12] if we continue
[2:52:13] we will not stop now but uh
[2:52:15] we have much to to cover i think we will
[2:52:18] have to cover it within three subs two
[2:52:19] services two more services but i really
