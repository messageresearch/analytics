us close to thee as we share your word lord bless the people that are gathered lord wherever they are and let your word have an impact on them amen praise the name of the lord amen i want to greet the three of you that are here in the name of jesus christ and also the three connections uh on zoom i'm happy to see sister lydia brother joel and the family there and uh may the lord bless you and those that are gathered at my home now we did not announce to the believers yet that we shall be connecting by zoom as those of you are here and and some of you already know we are in lockdown here again so we cannot be able to meet uh i'm trying to see whether my audio okay brother joel is asking for the link just get a link for my status you can be able to share that with whoever wants it uh i hope my audio is fine now uh we have not yet announced the believers how we are going to be doing this but i think we shall this is the way to go we'll just be doing it by zoom because for a period of uh two two months we are not going to be able to meet in the church because of the soaring cases of the covet but i believe that god will give us grace to go through it again amen so let us just start use a few minutes uh probably about 30 or 40 minutes just uh i thought it is a must as much as i had not announced it but it is a must to fellowship and and give the world the bible says that we should be ready in season and out of season amen and so it looks like out of season this time but we don't have to sleep and say that i will not do it now uh i do not think that there is anybody who needs interpretation uh if there seems to be somebody i'll let you know all right let us go to isaiah 66. if there is anyone who needs interpretation please just send us uh send us a text so we can be able to have the brother interpret uh isaiah 66 verse one two five brother kelo i'm happy to see you i know that you have uh been battling as well uh how are you now yeah i can see you're strong we thank god we thank god i believe many people were infected but the grace of god is taking us through brother kelly you came here on sunday and i know you couldn't even finish the service but we thank god that he has given you grace and healing thus faith the lord i'm reading from verse 1 of isaiah 66 that saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my food still where is the house that he built unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things has mine hand made and all those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i look even to him that is of a poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word he that killeth an ox is as if he's you a man and he that sacrifices alarm as if he cut off a dog's neck he that offereth an oblation uh as if he offered swans blood he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol yeah they have chosen their ways their own ways and they are so delighted in their own abominations amen may the lord bless you and bless his word you may have your seats and by the shame i don't think you may want to tamper with that until as we hear that if somebody says the because you cannot be able to monitor the sound for now okay but uh i think but brother joel or sister can you tell us if the audio is fine before we we start the sharing is the audio fine you can answer that through whatsapp or just through the your whatsapp the zoom message so that i am sure that the audio is fine and no one is answering me so i can't continue i do not know if the audio is fine okay he just said it is fine now uh i i was trying to connect this on the on the new channel that i just created uh called days of the voice fellowship on youtube but as i somehow failed because i had not tried to to use the new channel yet uh the other channel the message site i just wanted to leave it for uh the outreach mainly you know because these are long meetings one hour or so and uh but the other channel i'm just really been praying and thinking about continuing to make some of these clips that we made in in our sign your house is the lydia uh the lord willing we shall be able to make more of this here uh just for the for the outreach so the other channel i'll leave it for that and uh and then uh the uh this other new channel which i created we can be able to use it to stream the uh the meetings the meetings here for whosoever may want to stream that from from the youtube later so but for now i think i'll have to just either upload this later or we'll just have to begin streaming from another service so i would like i've already preached on this two times so i want to have uh to take to speak on it again this that time to this but to this man will i look and i take that from uh i take that from this verse verses two for all those things as my handmade and all these those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i look uh even to him that is of a poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word so suddenly you have been following and you know from verse one we have been able to see god saying that everything that is he is the one who has created it the heaven and the earth and everything therein the heaven is his throne and the earth is his footstool so which house can you build for the lord and indeed we found out that there is no house we can be able to build for the lord because he does not delight in a physical building he does not delight in a physical house in a physical uh focused building but he has something that he delights in and he has been able to say on verse two he says that for all those things his hand has made but then he says but i will look to this man will i look but to this man will i look now which man is he speaking of we have been able to in detail uh talk about this man and uh i first of all in the uh previous service i was able to we went a little bit in the godhead some of you might have thought it was a little off topic but it wasn't because uh it was jesus that was the perfect manifestation of the of god as you see in the book of malachi chapter 3 and i think we shall read it quickly malachi chapter 3 i did speak of this but i did not read it previously so let's read it malachi 3 1 he says behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye the light in behold they shall come saith the lord of hosts so the messenger of the covenant is the same as the lord okay he is the one who made the covenant with uh with noah that he would not let the wild or not destroy the earth with water again and he put that [Music] rainbow as a sign as a convent as a sign of the covenant that they made or to seal the covenant that they made and so then here we notice that is the also the one that uh swore by himself to be able to do the work of redemption or the work of salvation and also we see he says that and the lord whom he is sick of course the jews at this time they were seeking for the lord of hosts the god of glory the the one who was the creator of heaven and earth the god of abraham isaac and jacob and he says the lord whom he is sick will now come in his temple suddenly will come in his temple now suddenly before anybody would know anyone would find out before even the religious man would figure out amen who that god is he would suddenly come in his temple and we notice that that temple in the new testament jesus christ picks up the scripture and he says you can destroy this temple you can destroy this temple in one day and i will be able to raise it up in three days and of course they thought he was meaning the temple the body uh the building rather the building of solomon the temple of solomon and they were so sad they were angry actually at him how can you destroy this temple in how can you destroy and and how can you raise it up in three days when we have built it for very many years i think it was about 40 years 40 something years we've raised this temple for over 40 years and you being one man you were actually saying that you can raise it up in three days so this was offensive for them because they did not understand that jesus was no longer speaking of the building made with hands he was now speaking over a more holy temple he was now speaking of a more precious temple he was now speaking of a temple that was not made with hands a temple that he himself built a house where amen he would be housed he would be able to dwell now god had changed the dwelling place he was no longer dwelling in the holy of holies and somebody was asking me that what is the shekinah glory the sheikah glory is the presence of god that dwelt in the holy of holies and that no man was uh was able to end all would enter there but only he that was sanctified only he that was ready and worthy to enter in and uh that was the high priest and he also did not enter in whenever he wanted he entered in that place once in a year and he entered in there to be able to stand between or to uh to to uh uh to mediate for the sins his own and and those of his brethren and uh he would enter in there as we saw with chains on on his uh or you know tied on him in case he fell down they could not even enter in there all they had to do is to pull him out because that was the holiest of holy it was where god dwelled it was where the act of the covenant was it was where the presence of god was it was where the shekinah glory was and so in there was life and god himself dwelt in there so the jews respected that place the jews respected the temple of solomon because the temple of solomon was the dwelling place of god literally dwelling place of god himself amen god who dwelled in heaven amen now had come down among the men tapping accord with men in that temple of solomon but now notice when jesus christ came amen he had now transferred the dwelling or the coming of jesus transfer the dwelling place of god from just the building which was made with the hands of men to allow a building which was created by god himself you know he would say which which which place will you will you build for me which dwelling place will you make for me which house would you make for me heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool so which place which which place will you build for me that my hand does not mean and so we see that there was no place but the one that he himself had created by the spoken word and jesus christ actually is the spoken word of god jesus christ is the flesh is god himself spoken into the human body and so we see that he was that temple the temple now was transferred from being the temple of solomon it was now jesus christ so jesus was now at that time the temple of god so notice but we have to take it from there 2000 years ago because when we talk about jesus as being the temple of god we are talking about what happened 2000 years ago but we have to take it also from 2000 years ago and bring it to our time now what is what place what house will we build for the lord what will be the dwelling place of god is now no longer also the body the literal body of jesus because it's no longer here on earth but there's another body amen a body which amen he has prepared for himself to dwell in it's no longer the body of the literal man jesus but it's the body of jesus christ here on after day amen which is you and me amen which is the the bodies of the the the the hearts of the predestinated amen those seeds of god who have been known before the foundation of the world amen that they will receive eternal life those are the ones that god would like to dwell in today in our generation that's why he says but to this man we like luke at the time of jesus he was able to look unto him and even sounded him and the voice from the heavens and he said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased of course to dwell in and we see that that at that time was jesus but today amen it is me says jesus it is you the body amen that he is calling in amen we the body of christ on earth today the body of christ is all over the world it's not in one place it's not in one fellowship it's all over the world and that body of christ is they that have had the gospel believed the gospel filled with the holy ghost amen going through those three stages of grace they've been called by the grace of god and justified and have been sanctified and they have been filled with the holy ghost they are the body of our lord jesus christ and and then he says but to this man will i look and we notice that he is he says that what type of a man the man that is of a poor and a contract spirit and he that trembleth at my word at his word we noticed that i also took you through the genesis and we talked a little bit about cain we talked about abel and we examined each of them and saw that cain did not have a faculty within him to receive the word because cain was serpent seed no matter what you would do no matter how many preachers would preach to him no matter how anointed the preacher would be he could not move the heart of cain because cain did not have a seed jam in him that would be able to sprout out that would be able to bring forth life you see cain was a serpent uh seed he was the seed of the serpent he was not the seed of god and and and today we have that seed in the world today you see all people in the world are not equal no matter how much you want to make them equal all of them are not equal and somebody told me so you mean god is a segregationist i said well i do not know how you want to understand it but here is what i believe that all human beings on on this earth are not of the same seed amen there are those the bible says are the children of the devil and there are those that the bible says are the children of god and then the bible says that they that are born of god amen do not sin why can they not sin because the seed of god remains in them so no matter how much you would like to bring the equality and try to say that all human beings on this earth are equal and they are entitled to the same rights that's not the god i know the god i know has only one right that he has given to every believer or not even a believer to every human being and that right is the right to make a choice be it serpent seed or goddess seed they have even their free moral agents they can be able to decide what is it that they want to do what is it that they want to live what kind of life they want to live what kind of thing they want to do where they want to go what they want to do what they want to be god doesn't decide those things for you no matter what is in your heart you decide hey don't think they can do those kind of things for you you know god has made you a free moral agent so that well of course he being god he for one knew he knew what would be but he never made what was to be do you understand what i'm what i'm saying he knew what would be he knew that he would be a believer but he never tried to pull you and enforce you and and make you a believer no you had the word you had the gospel and when you hear the gospel in your heart you yourself you receive it and accept it why because in your heart there is a seed of god and now when you accept it god knew that you would accept it why because within your heart is a seed to believe but god never uh coerced or foster or moved on on your heart and and and forced you but he moved on your heart and them and compelled you by his word for you to make a choice you see eve eve was a child of god you could say she was a seed of god but eve was the same why was she deceived she was deceived because she chose to be deceived she knew the word but she was deceived because she accepted she gave in amen now we have a right also amen to either give in to the devil or refuse the devil amen even what is going around now around the world called the coronavirus and killing very many people and even here in uganda many people starting to die and many other countries but here is what i want to tell you as believers yes we have to take all the precautionary measures but we have to understand that our goal the god we believe is much greater than any disease that would ever come on this planet whether it is formed in a laboratory or whether just coming as a pandemic or whether it is sent out from god i don't care what i want to believe as believers we we have to stand out amen against all these demons you see but what does the devil do the devil brings in fear in our hearts to make us disbelieve what god has said so that he can be able to take us away from our god-given rights and our god-given rights is to make a choice now we amen have made a choice to believe what god has said and god has said tell me that by my stripes you are healed amen and we should keep believing that but abandoned say that you know even if he prayed for i don't know how many thousands of people and each of them died they would still be preached and believe divine hearing why amen it's not about how many people have been healed when he prayed for them it's about how many people it's about his faith in the word of god it's about our faith in the word of god not about what we have seen happen but what we have heard him say he said it we believe it that settles it you believe that with all your heart hallelujah and so he says but to this man we like luke and then he begins to describe the kind of man that is going to even look at now why did he look at jesus did you know that when jesus was on this earth the whole eyes of heaven were upon him did you know that all heaven all heaven was on jesus and brother banham said that whatever was in god he powered in jesus he pardoned christ and whatever was in christ he powered in the church amen all the eyes of heaven was upon him why because he was even the begotten son of god he was a born of bones of god and nature of the nature of god the flesh of the flesh of god and every character that was in him was the character that was in god and so all eyes looked upon him did you know that jesus never did anything but what was written in the word about him you know they came john sent them go and find out if he is jesus and uh and uh uh and he said that uh they went to him and they tried to uh they tried to do them they asked him are you john said he sent us to you to ask you are you jesus are you the one oh we should wait for another praise the name of the lord hallelujah and uh john answered rather jesus answered and told told them he said go and tell john what you have seen and heard me do because john knew jesus rather jesus knew that john was a bible prophet and that john would understand that if jesus was the messiah he would do everything the bible told or spoke of him so now if you want to know who you are if you want to know whether you're a seed of god if you want to know whether you're a child of god it's not difficult it's very easy the only thing you need to do my brother my sister is to ask somebody else ask your brother ask your sister how am i they will tell you by your works by your fruits he said by your by their fruits you shall know them by what you do and by what you say go and tell john what you have heard and what you have seen go and tell him it's by what you do and it's by what you say that's how we judge you that's how we judge you that's how we can be able to tell what kind of seed is in your heart and now we are able to know who jesus was not because he at any time said i am jesus the messiah but because of what he did what he did spoke of what he would do in the world when he comes he stood up and he knew right where the bible spoke of him and he took up the book of isaiah chapter what's this verse chapter 61 i believe it is you can open it up quickly praise the lord and he takes it and begins to read and he says the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach the good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and he ended it there and he said everybody looked at him let us hear what you will say about the scripture remember what he's going to say will tell who he is this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears what is said was exactly what was happening or what had happened at that time jesus even was invading himself amen as the savior of the world as the redeemer as the kinsman our kingsman redeemer as the one that came to declare the acceptable yeah of the lord he declared who he was amen by knowing what part of scripture spoke of him he knew what where he was in the word of god do you know where you are in the word of god now of course all eyes in heaven were upon jesus now we see today all eyes in heaven are upon you and me hallelujah and how do we know that we know that because it says but to this man now of course we are reading in isaiah 66 where we've been but to this man will i look which house will you be with me but to this man will i look even the man who has a poor uncontrolled spirit what is a poor and contrast spirit we did talk about that a little bit a poor and a conduit spirit is that kind of spirit that will receive the word [Music] that kind of spirit that will tremble that kind of heart which will tremble at the word of god whatever the word of god says you believe regardless of your own opinion you will be ready to surrender your opinion for the word of god no matter how much you feel that this should be this way in your own opinion but what is god's word is no longer our opinion that is why we believe this message that is why we receive this message my brother my sister because we have desire to surrender our own opinions amen to receive the word of god regardless of what i think about it regardless of how i want it to be regardless of what i thought it should be amen is what god has said it should be not my opinion of what it should be hallelujah i will receive his word no matter what i think no matter what i want no matter what i feel i will receive his word if you also will be that way then he says to this man well i look such a man and on on on sunday i did speak a little bit about the the the three things that god is going to do as it comes in to take over your heart and i was reading a quote for you i never did finish it but i think i'll take that verse once again and read it and then finish up the other quote which i started and then we can finish for tonight and i'll sanctify now of course i'm reading in ezekiel chapter 36 to those who were not uh here on sunday ezekiel 36 23 to 27 and i will sanctify and you'll forgive us we did not prepare to give you the quotes today it's the first time we are doing this zoom this zoom thing and i'll sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which we have profaned in the midst of them all mine and the heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes and i did speak and dwell on that march on sunday for i will take you from among the hidden and gather you out from or gather you out of all countries and i'll bring you into your own land then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you now many people come to the lord but they do not want to let go of their idols what is an idol an idol is something that you worship other than god and who is god god is a spirit but god is a a dwell god dwells in his own word and so an idol is something or that opinion of yours that you have that you cherish so much or higher than god and that kind of opinion it can be an opi opinion that you hold it can be a thought that you hold it can be a something that you have it can be anything whatever it is as long as it is anti-word it's against the word it is an idol but i'm gonna say that i'll clean you i will take you away from all these idols i'll bring you to your own land amen i'll take you from all these things and i'll take you from all your idols and i will cleanse you the desire the purpose of god for you and me my brother is for you for for us to be cleansed for us to be watched for us to be sanctified not only justified remember when he says i will take you it means i will justify you because justify means to be rendered sinless you were a sinner by choice amen an iron by birth but now you've been adopted you've been made sinless you've been made holy you've been made a child of god you've been made perfect before the sight of god even without you doing anything yet and that is justification when you hear the word of god and you receive it then it takes you from your idols that it takes you from the world and he takes it from the heathen from among the heathen that is justification and when he brings you down here then he says that i will cleanse you from all your idols then i'll cleanse you from all your opinions then i crazy from all your perspectives this is how i see it that's how i see it amen in this message it is no longer how you say it it is how god says it amen no matter even if all the world sees something in one way you will see it another way because god sees it another way such a message and a bad nego they were told to bow down they were told to bow down to an idol but because their god saw that in a wrong way in a bad way he saw that something wrong they also refused to bow down to the idol the king said when you hear the drums when you hear all kinds of music bow down and worship so you see we can go on that match but here's my point you see the king had everything arranged he had everything figured out how the people would be able to dance to his music and every day the purpose of the king of the world the purpose of the devil today is to make us dance to his music my brother he wants us to dance to his music he wants us to dash to his music and eventually he wants us to bow to his idols but god amen by his grace hallelujah he has given us a mind to understand his word he has given us a new mind he has given us a new understanding he has given us a new faith able to receive his word he has cleansed us from all our idols and when these people saw and heard the music they said we will not bow we will not bend we will not bow we will not bend my brothers and sisters let us not bow let us not bend no matter what the devil does let us not bow let us not bend and if there be any young person listening the others would could go in the dance parties and in the beer parties but you even whoever had the word of god and you've been released from your idols you will say i will not bow i will not bend they can go on with their smoking but for you you will not bow you're not burned they can go on with their alcoholism you will not bow you will not burn to these things they can go on even with their you know uh uh fornications and um one day i i i will speak on those three things the pride of life the last of the flesh and the last of the eyes i want to speak only on it probably when i'm done with this and i believe that the lord will bless you so much especially for the young people now i want you to understand that god by his grace is calling us out of all these things like message saddrish and a bad neighbor to say even if all the world forsake jesus even if all the world bows down and bends to the sound of the music of the king of the world i will not bow i will not bend do to me whatsoever you will and god has never forsaken his own god will not forsake us he will stand with us he will fight for us he he'll give us victory if we don't bow and if we don't bend the others can take the bribes and they can you know try to even some believers it is so it's a shame it is a shame you know some believers that try to put bribes in the bible and try to support it say if you're driving and a traffic officer arrests you then he is like well i'll take you to jail i'll take you to jail unless you you give me something so he says well settle with your with your neighbor before he takes you to court or whatever so that was how settle i would settle with her i'll settle with a traffic officer let me give him something small if you do that you have already bent your your back you have already bowed down to the idol we want believers god is looking for believers who will not bow who will not bend amen they will speak with a word hallelujah amen even if it is something small even if it is you know something which looks so small you will stand him and write to the values of god amen the word of god because that is what god wants you to live by we do not live by anything else we live by faith in the word of god we do not leave amen by the the the the favor of man we live by the word of god we do not even leave amen by other people helping us or by somebody doing something for me or because you know those kind of things we live by faith in the word a sincere child of god don't even live because of your job amen you go to work and you put in all your efforts but you don't even leave by your job or work you leave by faith in the word of god i'm living by faith in the word of god you must live by faith in the word of god faith will always take you through because we have sinned and had it in this day that a prophet has told us that faith in the word of god as long as you believe the word of god for the word of god amen we will be faithful at all times in any time the word of god will ever come in any season in any place it will overcome the word of god will take you through the word of god will guide you all your life hallelujah to this man will i look and then he begins to speak of those idols that he's going to cleanse us from i will cleanse you allow god to cleanse you yield yourself surrender your will and let him cleanse you let him make you a man a woman he wants you to be a new heart also will i give you and we found out that's the first thing he will do and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i'll give you a heart of flesh praise the lord and i'll put my spirit within you and cause you to work in my statutes and ye shall be my shall keep my judgments and do them amen the only way you can be able to do the judgments of god and to keep his word is if you have his spirit in you and that's why he says i'll give you a new heart and i'll give you put within you and your spirit and eventually i'll give you my spirit and when you receive his spirit then you can be able to do his will we cannot be able to do his will in the nature that we have been having from birth we need to be reborn we need to be born again we need to receive a divine nature that is picked off in in the book of peter will not receive the divine nature the nature of christ what is the nature of christ the nature of christ is the opinion of christ about life is the idea of christ is the perspective of christ is the life of christ you don't look at things anymore the way others look at it you look at things in a different way with different eyes in a different fashion and others will say you are different and some of them may even say what is wrong with you because they can't understand what kind of life you are living my sister you will dress that dress because you you have the nature of christ you will throw away them trousers you will throw away at the miniskirts you would throw away those things of the world and make ups you will throw them all away and people can't understand why you do that but because you have received the divine nature the nature of christ my brother you leave them dance parties and their beer parties and them and the and the smoking and the drinkings and all those pleasures of the world why because even you have received that divine nature a nature which is not of the world the nature which is of christ and sometimes we think it's living only the bad things but also even leaving the evil communication because the bible says do not have evil communication through your mouth you find yourself sometimes when you are you you know you are together with the people with the believers what do you talk what the bible says think on these things what things is there praise on them is there you know is there a virtue on them you know think on these things things which will build your inner man amen we have to encourage one another whenever we meet you know why because the devil doesn't like it but you see we love it we love the nature of jesus christ praise the name of the lord let me read a little bit of a function of this of this uh uh of this quote and then uh we can we can we can finish up [Music] praise the name of the lord now i'm reading from the message why so many christians find it hard to live why is it that so many christians find it so hard to leave a christian life now that is uh 570303 for those who might want to look it up now he says well now we got all kinds of everything for coming and you haven't got it till you get it now he's talking about the holy spirit but brother you haven't got it until you until there is the spirit of god comes from heaven and changes your life so your life has to be changed and by the time your life gets changed then you can now tell that you have the holy spirit it's not a feeling it's not an emotion so i can feel it now i have it mm-hmm we found out that that will be the new spirit but not the holy spirit actually one of the mysteries that the prophet was able to open to us in this hour is the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation did you hear that the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation that's one of the mysteries that have been revealed in this day so what does it mean does it mean you receive the holy ghost like a baptist certainly not but it just rather means that the holy ghost is no longer ascribed uh to being shouting uh to being speaking in tongues to being any of these emotions or gifts but at the holocaust is rather the life of jesus by the nature of jesus christ living in you bringing forth that which was in christ whereby people will be able to see you and see the fruits amen emanating out of you human which is no longer that of you on making but that that christ has made through you it's like he said now you leave my word you will do my word and you will keep my judgments you see because it's another life in you i've got a life of g of christ in me i've got a life of christ in me i've got his nature i've got his ability i have the life of jesus christ in me it's no longer my emotions it's nothing to do with it follow here he says but brother you haven't got it until there is the spirit of of god comes from heaven and changes your life that makes the future of your life a different person did you hear that when he comes in oh my hallelujah everything about you changes you become a different a different person means your nature your character changes and then he says but they are fruit you shall know them that's the reason you have so much ups and downs you get a new spirit you know you get a new spirit you quit your drinking you get a new spirit you quit your you're lying you get a new spirit you can do most anything with that spirit did you hear a lot with that news now remember the new spirit is not the holy spirit the new spirit is your spirit that god gives you but it says under that face of your spiritual life you can do most of the things that a christian does you can quit your life you can quit your drinking you can actually speak times you can you can be lovely many things will happen you can shout you can dance you can yell you can laugh in the holy ghost why because you have a new spirit and it says under you get a new spirit you can do most of everything with that spirit but that isn't what god is talking about [Music] a new spirit he said i will give you now watch i'll give you a new heart and a new spirit why he would have given you he would have given you a new spirit he would have to give you a new spirit to live for him amen when he gives you a new spirit it enables you it gives you the ability even to live for him to yield yourself because with your own spirit in that old nature of yours you cannot be able to yield to him you are starchy cold you you are formal you you are in your own ways you have a stretchy spirit but it says but to this man when i remove he hallelujah that has a poor and a contrite spirit and the poor and accomplished spirit is the new spirit that god gives to you and it says why you couldn't even live with yourself with the spirit you did have oh many people with the old spirit the old nature that they had him and many of them even commit suicide can you imagine someone can hate themselves so much that they take their own lives so with the old spirit that you had it says you couldn't even live with yourself you couldn't even live with your neighbor you couldn't even associate with the next man in the next corner you couldn't even associate with these christians you can't because that old spirit of yours is selfishly bad why you would have an awful spirit you had it so he has to give you a new spirit my brother hallelujah amen he has to give you a new spirit i'll give you a new heart amen and a new spirit now watch and i'll put after all that then he says and i will put amen my spirit in you and he says there is the difference i will put my spirit in you and there is where you find it so hard that you go down to church and you get a different concept you know what i believe i ought to go to church then you go back home and say hallelujah i got it now you haven't then you go down to church and you say oh i believe that something just happened i believe something happened to me i don't look at things the way i used to do hallelujah and then in a few days you find yourself right down into the same old rat that you was he here you find that you got down into the same old rat that you was doubting reasoning everything else you see what did you get it wasn't the holy ghost it was the new spirit when you receive the new spirit it can get you get into all those kind of high ups and you feel like oh yeah i got it then you go back down in your old life you find that oh you're still being defeated it is hard to live a christian life these things are so boring it is so hard it's oh god i can't make it have mercy on me why because all you got was a new spirit and your spirit will help you to come close to god to have an association a relationship but you see within it it's there's no holding power there's no you know power of of con uh uh of sustaining sustainability in the christian world and he says well now if pastor if pastor so and so say that that wasn't right i don't believe it's right i'll just take his word for it and i and i tell you i'm going to do this and do that and you find yourself up and down in and out you just didn't go far enough so many christians find it so hard to live a christian life because they did not go far enough even they go as far as receiving a new spirit but they don't go as far as receiving the holy ghost and so you find that they sometimes this looks like they have it and sometimes it looks like they they are very far away sometimes it's easy for them to you know say amen to the world sometimes it's so hard sometimes they will take something because the pastor said it sometimes you know it's a struggle why because they have not yet received the holy ghost and you say brother panama i got all the evidences you know i can talk tongues i can shout i can you know dance to the holy ghost i can do that on this i can roll on the floor i'm a holy roller it means i have the holy ghost oh no no wait a moment he says i know but we are not talking about evidences we are talking about the product hallelujah that's right yes sir i've seen even shout i've seen them speak with tongues i've seen them lay down a pencil and write in the unknown tongues and on them and i wish raise up and read it and interpret and tell the truth if a man could speak with times if a man could shout if a man could see visions if a man could do any of those things that he can do without divine love they are lost divine love brother banana is trying to bring in here as the product because remember he says god is love and so if god is love then our product is to be like him is to have his nature his character that's right christ is the christ is in the heart he has to be in there so don't be deceived by signs and evidences they are all kinds of signs the bible said in the last days false prophets will rise up and show signs it will deceive the very elect if it were possible do you know why it would have almost received the very elect because the elect would only believe the world okay and these signs that these first prophets will show are part of the world so the elect will almost want to believe it because they see it in the world until we have even had some believers who say let me go to prophet saw and so even if it's a pentecostal but at least what he he does is in the bible it is what is in the bible he has a gift you see it would almost deceive the very elect and let me tell you never go there because you would be deceived and if you are the elect you shun them things and your source will be the message of the hour your source will be the word of god for this day hallelujah if you will deceive the vedic that if you are possible thank god is not possible come back to the bible science notice now i'll give you a new spirit and i will put my spirit now notice the new heart is put right in the middle of you and the new spirit is put right in the middle of your new heart and his spirit is put right in the middle of the new spirit his spirit is put right in the middle of your new spirit and it's just like the main spring in a famous watch the mainspring in a famous watch where all the other how do they call it they move around that mainspring when that main spring sets in the middle of the watch it controls every movement of that watch and that's what the matter friends now i hope you see this and i'm not saying it to try to twist or to be indifferent i'm only saying it because i know that some but someday i'll stand in the judgment with you you see if the holy spirit is in the middle of your spirit and that watch spring makes all the rest of the movements just stick just exactly to the place keeping perfect time when the holy spirit is in the middle of your spirit it makes every action of the holy spirit in you tick off just exactly according to god's time piece the bible so you don't lie you don't steal you you you got associates and you are and you are lovely and you've got peace joy and long suffering goodness weakness patience why oh the future of the spirit just sticks right with that main spring see what i mean oh my this is just so lovely hallelujah you see now i'm about to finish now it says now it's the main spring that does it it's the holy ghost that does it it's your church that does it it isn't just church that does it it isn't your pastor that does it it is not your shouting that does it it's not your speaking with tongues that doesn't it's not your healing service that does it it's the holy ghost that does it god is holy ghost in the middle of your new spirit it makes the whole church operate just exactly one big band of life hallelujah and he says friends examine ourselves today examine it by the way and we as believers ought to examine ourselves every day we need to examine ourselves every day may the lord bless you and my prayer is that he will give you that holy spirit he will give you that part of him he himself will give himself to you that you will be in the stature of a perfect man that you will be in the nature of jesus christ it's my prayer for you and
