since no matter what is happening around us no matter what you're going through our God is able to amen man he can come the storm in your life part of your life Jesus Christ sideways Christmas set free amen let's sing a civil Precious Blood of Jesus Church of God amen uh shall return to our Bibles today Bible is afraid and read with me in the book of Jeremiah chapter five [Music] chapter five are you there is if you're there you say Amen we are reading verses 6. up to seven wherever a lion out of forest shall slay them in a wolf of the evening shall spoil them a lower part shall watch over their cities everyone that goes out thence shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many and they're backslidings are increased how shall I pardon thee for this thy children are forsaken me and sworn by them that are not gods when I heard fed them to the full they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the Hollywood's house foreign [Music] [Music] precious Lord Jesus it's a Christian window we thank you for the reading of the world Lord you know how weak I am come on how insufficient I Am Lord and why the Lord open this the pages of this book pray that may the blood of Jesus in Jesus we are reading another scripture in the book of Hosea foreign he says this and my people are bent to backsliding from me though they call them to the most high none at all would exalt him how shall I give thee up Ephraim how shall I deliver thee Israel how shall I make thee as asthma how shall I set thee as zebon my heart is turned within me my repentance are kindled together foreign blessed in the name of the Lord this evening I will call my text backsliding praise be to God it may not be backsliding as in uh maybe committing sin like maybe falling in our adultery idolatry Queens Linda also it's a monk that's part of it also but mainly we are going to look at the conditions blessed in the name of the Lord and backsliding it means to move back America I remember last time we shared about being washful not to be not uh not to drift um and you know drifting it's not like a sudden movement it is not something which happens very rapidly blessed the name of the Lord but realize drifting in something that's happened slowly and by the time you realize you are very far blessed in the name of the Lord and here we are seeing God speaking to Israel where we have read in Hosea that is chapter 11 verses 7. and my people are bent to backsliding from me amen Mina and we are living in the time when the charge is backsliding the church is drifting from their grounds amen are this happening gradually [Music] that's why the Bible tells us to watch and be vigilance [Music] what shall we pray amen the prophet says that we backslide every day blessed with the name of the Lord but the backsliding I'm looking at tonight is where we are drifting from our positions [Music] where we are moving us from the first love [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord and remember even in scriptures where God is rebuking the first church the church and the prophet says it's a compound word meaning it means together aiming I'm looking for it somewhere here blessed with the name of the Lord I believe I'll see it and relaxed [Music] blessed the name of the Lord rebuking them he's telling them to go back to the first love and he told them about I have someone against you amen man go back that you to the first love and what is the first love Jesus said I'm the alpha and the Omega yes these people they were aiming [Music] that but some of their dreams and they relaxed and God became concerned and he rebuked them and told them repent and go back the first language in the first way back is repentance the only way we can go back the First Love Is by repentance and maybe by the end of this service we will shake ourselves and everybody will see where is one thing blessed be the name of the Lord amen here he says that uh that my people bent to backslide from me again amen amen message Believers are the message Believers have determined to backslide from me every single day it draws Us near to the coming of the Lord and if the church which is going to be Rapture has to be in that same condition it was the first church was where are we living today how far have we moved to time the queen can achieve blessed with the name of the Lord amen [Applause] I am aware of God the material we have the message of preparation preparing us amen man every time we come in the service the world is preparing us bring us to Rapture conditions blessed with the name of the Lord you cannot induce foreign praise the Lord and if you're living in the Rapture time the church must be ready because Christ is ready because amen blessed with the name of the Lord in the message the prophet says that don't fed back into the very things that you came out of there you are drifting praise the Lord amen amen amen backsliding is drifting back [Music] moving back but remember Christians not supposed to be neutral um you don't have to be neutral ground either you were hurt but you cannot be neutral and in Christianity God expect us to move forward blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen laying aside everywhere being a side every sin running the rest which you said before around amen this is not the microphy calling there is Jesus Christ and that's where our Target is send me the name of the Lord amen man me now so God rebuked them here God is complaining God is telling them from me God is willing to walk with us God wants us to move forward but many times means the church want to stand straight and remember in scriptures amen the church has stayed in this condition for so long we are reading the word every day and we are contented but friends we are on the journey amen there's no we can pitch our tents here praise the Lord we are on our way when you are going somewhere if you are very important Journey you cannot move remember this is the race the minister uh home minister told us um he was talking about the race and he said we are the last restaurant [Music] amen started to Luther yeah [Applause] if you look into that kind of race I think it's called five thousand meters nobody is given a stick and they ran and reach somewhere and then they sit down but it's very possible with the church sometimes things which are impossible with it physically they are possible spiritually [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord amen Amina but we better watch [Music] backsliding or going forward you ate the backslide forward in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today so God wants us to move forward he wants his church to grow he want us to move forward every time we hear the word we must act upon that word we must live according to that word amen this message still takes us back the first love we talked about because the first love is the Alpha and the first love is blessed be the name of the Lord is not a position with God [Music] amen but don't go back to what we we should not go back to what we came from you know backsliding is funny you may not know that you're backsliding because you are drifting slowly amen [Music] amen used to come early for fellowship at you stretch yourself for five minutes that is the condition of Believers blessed with the name of the Lord amen that is a sign of backsliding you are moving back slowly you find even clapping for the Lord is a heavy burden to you it may not be a big thing but God is interested in those small things you are doing you spend the whole week without praying you spend the whole day without even singing one song you are always busy Brothers but the Bible says are you ready for the flower foreign amen seven steps and Perfection blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm here to tell you let us repent and go back and do that which that which we have dropped to correct go back to the first love praise be to God Amen Amina Christ wanted to be in love with him that sweet love when you are just started I would sing the whole day doing your work when you are worshiping God deep in God sent me the name of the Lord but what happens amen Amina he says I noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying getting out of the line this is a this is when the when when God told the prophet that uh do you want to see that preview of The Bride cartoon [Music] Amen in the message the Rapture and the prophet says I noticed one of them crying two or three of them trying but really getting out of the line and I screamed and they cannot stay in the line and the vision left me and I was still standing in the room screams the prophet saw you [Applause] [Applause] he says well for the lion out of the forest shall slay them in a wolf and a world of wealth of the evening shall spoil them Allah shall wash over their cities every one of them everyone or everyone that goes out theirs shall be torn into pieces because their transgressions are many and they're backsliding are increased here God was speaking to Judah area because their transgressions were made you've heard up here he said that a lion out of the forest of the evening shall spoil them almost shall watch over their cities in oculated how shall I pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken me and stole by their by by them that are no Gods our God is a jealous of God God shares his glory with nobody is better for us to stay tuned [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord but God want us to move forward blessed with the name of the Lord here God was speaking type of a pride it's Financial he's telling them they have box leading but they did but any say in here we see how I would say they'll be eaten by foreign when he saw some of them were moving out how are you standing tonight if you check yourself by the mirror of the world where are you brother sister be the name of the Lord amen are you still on your knees are you still watching and praying are you still sober in the future blessed be the name of the Lord God said I will speed and stand the first love that's where God won this church that's where God whatever amen [Music] thank

[Applause] blessed with the name of the Lord amen God was there when Adam sinned he did not even want to look at Adam oh something has just come into my mind it's like when you are when you're in courtship and maybe somewhere somehow you get some misunderstandings and everyone said I will not call huh I remember I think our days what's happened whether it was I think it was not there Obama sometimes you write a message you feel you are dying of somebody and you write a message you want to text me fast foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign blessed with the name of the Lord amen praise be to God Katana famous Talk of the Lamb of God that is what God is missing and that's what why God told them repent go back the first one God loved the first love my my third first love amen
