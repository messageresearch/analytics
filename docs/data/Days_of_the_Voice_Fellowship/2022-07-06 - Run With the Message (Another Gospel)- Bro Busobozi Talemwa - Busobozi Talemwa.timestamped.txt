[12:19] jesus shall come back
[12:26] amen
[12:27] let us go to the scripture tonight
[12:30] the book of colossians chapter 1 verse 6
[12:35] happy to see every one of you
[12:39] this evening uh we are having my little
[12:42] sister account
[12:47] the sister to my wife
[13:19] wonderful family there
[13:21] and the family are we
[13:22] you and uh
[13:24] we are we're glad to have them
[13:28] for going about charity day it was very
[13:31] painful for for my wife for my for her
[13:34] sister to get married
[13:41] together
[13:44] but now they're meeting again after many
[13:46] years
[14:32] a marvel that he has soon removed from
[14:34] him that called you into the grace of
[14:36] christ and to another gospel
[14:39] which is not another but there be some
[14:42] that trouble you and would pervert the
[14:44] gospel of christ
[14:54] christ
[15:10] jude chapter one so my name is
[15:14] okay
[15:16] verses three and four all in iraq
[15:20] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[15:22] you of the common salvation it was
[15:24] needful for me to write unto you and
[15:26] exhort you that he should honestly
[15:28] contend for the faith which was once
[15:30] delivered unto the saints for there are
[15:32] certain men crept in unawares who were
[15:35] before of old ordained to this
[15:37] condemnation and godly men turning the
[15:40] grace of god of our god into our
[15:42] seriousness and denying the only lord
[15:45] god and our lord jesus christ
[16:42] amen i mean
[16:47] so let us
[16:48] pray
[16:50] lord jesus uh we
[16:52] just commit ourselves into your hands
[16:54] and disservice
[16:58] that you will speak to our hearts one
[17:00] more time
[17:01] we're gonna name it
[17:11] are you happy to be in the house of the
[17:12] lord this evening
[17:16] so today
[17:18] tonight
[17:18] i'm speaking on it's going to be more
[17:21] like a part two to run with a message
[17:28] but my title tonight is
[17:44] because if you notice the way apostle
[17:46] paul speaks it to the galatians
[17:50] he says i marvel that he has soon
[17:52] removed from him
[17:57] into the grace of christ with such a
[17:59] christian he called you into the
[18:01] christians
[18:02] with such a christian but you are soon
[18:03] removed
[18:05] from him
[18:08] and we talked about the calling for uh
[18:11] several services here
[18:21] [Applause]
[18:48] and he expounds on that phrase
[18:52] and he says it's not entirely another
[19:09] uh the inspiration really that i have to
[19:11] speak on this subject
[19:15] you know i was with brother
[19:16] brother henry uh a few days ago
[19:19] no organ henry
[19:21] and he told me you know what he spoke on
[19:24] sunday was very appropriate
[19:27] too for you because at the time he had
[19:29] just started to look at uh some
[19:33] some ratings of a certain man who
[19:36] had been a pastor
[19:42] and he was now claiming that he is no
[19:44] longer believing the message
[19:50] now
[19:52] that always comes across as as if it
[19:55] were something new
[19:59] and someone or anybody would want to try
[20:02] and find out i'm going through another
[20:04] and yeah i got the
[20:10] so how come that someone would come up
[20:12] and say i was in the message
[20:18] i no longer believe
[20:32] this is a continuation i don't have new
[20:33] notes
[20:37] and so
[20:38] you hear you often hear people saying
[20:41] that they were in the gospel oh would it
[20:42] have been troubling and if it were the
[20:44] moon judy but they have received a new
[20:47] understanding
[20:50] that they now feel that what they
[20:52] believed is not true
[20:57] tonight i would like us to talk about
[21:00] the gospel
[22:46] [Music]
[22:50] vindicated by god himself
[22:55] and if there is going to be another
[22:57] ghost
[23:00] government indicated the same way now
[23:03] you can discover the first one
[23:05] you know
[23:22] [Applause]
[23:35] so it's the same bible by ibrahim but
[23:38] men perverted by what happened
[23:40] it's the same gospel engineering but men
[23:42] perfect
[23:44] by bringing in their ideas
[24:15] [Applause]
[24:16] around that because here whenever you
[24:18] see him behind your neck another one
[24:21] comes
[24:22] and he brings another revelation
[24:25] understanding of scripture
[24:27] and they view their whole church about
[24:30] it
[24:43] or private interpretation of scripture
[24:51] this message is not on the foundation
[24:53] that brother came and brought his
[24:55] interpretations
[25:00] [Music]
[25:41] brother balaam
[25:44] they fed on his steps
[25:48] they saw everything
[25:50] but they only pulled out what they loved
[26:02] [Music]
[26:22] one by one
[26:25] and this one of the of the woman
[26:27] president in america
[26:30] america really shook them so much
[26:33] yeah and you know one of them
[26:36] came up and he talked about it
[26:40] you know he wanted to give a prophecy
[26:42] but he realized he cannot give it as
[26:44] himself because he knows that
[26:46] already giving it many many many years
[27:18] we can
[27:22] [Music]
[27:38] this time he was saying uh he was saying
[27:40] that he noticed you know he started to
[27:43] tell the people
[27:45] actually
[28:09] and we have very many of such ministers
[28:12] and preachers with big followings even
[28:14] in our country nemo
[29:23] and i can see the light on somebody
[29:27] and when he saw that light and everybody
[29:29] understand that go over somebody
[29:31] you would look at that
[29:33] and then it would fade into a vision
[29:37] and then he would begin to see things
[29:38] about
[29:53] were nuclear amen and friends because
[29:57] that was just the beginning
[30:00] of a ministry everywhere that was
[30:02] actually prophesied off in the
[30:04] scriptures
[30:06] that would
[30:48] the animal he was god very controlled
[30:51] bringing this message
[30:54] restore us back to the foundation of the
[30:56] scriptures
[30:58] so we are not looking for vindication
[31:00] that is
[31:14] foreign
[31:58] why did they believe it to be the truth
[31:59] in the first place
[32:08] that's the first thing the second future
[32:09] committee now that they have received a
[32:11] new truth
[32:38] [Music]
[33:08] the gospel come not through the word
[33:11] only
[33:15] but through the power and the
[33:18] manifestation of the holy spirit
[33:31] amen amen look for that manifestation of
[33:34] the holy ghost
[34:04] shall be given
[34:18] foreign
[34:32] because
[35:00] quotation he asks
[35:03] a conjunction
[35:06] he's talking about mark 16.
[35:09] shall follow them that believes
[35:15] [Music]
[35:24] [Applause]
[35:31] [Music]
[35:43] a man cannot qualify himself as a
[35:47] believer until this has happened
[35:55] to god
[36:09] without that experience
[36:23] what you believe by reasoning
[36:29] no man not anymore
[36:32] out of your experience
[36:38] amen i knew where i was going
[36:41] i knew i was going to be a priest
[36:44] i was convinced
[36:47] after hearing the message for a very
[36:49] long time
[36:52] six good months
[37:46] [Music]
[38:10] [Music]
[38:26] [Music]
[38:29] he said what is that spirit
[38:46] but something even when she did not you
[38:48] know something kept on keeping a hold of
[38:51] one when she naturally connecting with
[38:53] her something moved my heart
[38:55] sin i got voice
[38:58] what does it were myself speaking to me
[39:00] the knee answer you'll get an answer
[39:02] stand down
[39:03] raise up your hand when you get confused
[39:04] i don't know what happened
[39:07] what i remember saying i was talking
[39:08] about i was on my feet
[39:10] with my hands
[39:12] and
[39:26] in the name of our lord
[39:46] [Music]
[40:02] [Music]
[40:04] no church can have the right to of
[40:05] calling themselves a believing church
[40:07] until the science has followed them
[40:11] now
[40:16] that is what jesus said
[40:18] was it doing it
[40:20] it's making the word manifest she no
[40:23] [Music]
[40:35] of god
[41:04] amen hallelujah amen you must receive
[41:08] the gospel
[41:10] you must accept the gospel
[41:13] what is it
[41:14] when you receive the word
[41:16] of god
[41:32] only switch gamble you can't say the
[41:35] gospel come to us not in word only
[41:40] but through power with a man and
[41:42] demonstration no
[41:44] no no collaboration
[42:55] i never knew even vocabulary
[43:09] how to capture the young people's mind
[43:13] that's not the way of god there you see
[43:15] him
[43:17] how does god speak to you
[43:19] god comes to you i don't want to get you
[43:21] out of the way and expect when there is
[43:24] sometimes it may be a rough way
[43:27] sometimes it may be at the moment
[43:32] there will be one thing that is sure
[43:34] what you do
[43:36] is always proceed with vindication
[43:44] and something solid
[43:46] or something like i never come to you
[43:48] like this
[43:50] but i come to you knowing only one thing
[44:36] you brothers that are listening to me
[44:39] you only need that manifestation
[44:44] hallelujah and every one of you is
[44:46] potentially a preacher
[45:16] memory
[45:18] and be millionaires
[45:21] today
[45:22] the preachers that we have
[45:25] have gone on our quest
[45:29] to have millionaires
[45:43] and preachers in uganda
[46:35] [Music]
[46:55] it means your ministry is blessed by god
[46:57] forever in every single opening
[47:01] but if you are a poor man never worry
[47:03] about anymore oh god has not blessed you
[47:05] don't know where is it
[47:08] the way god blesses
[47:36] this message
[47:50] not our
[48:18] is the one that the
[49:13] hello
[49:42] oh
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:22] is
[50:39] amen
[50:43] my my my my amen one day
[50:46] sometimes preachers when you speak these
[50:48] things
[50:50] my god why did you call me a bachelor
[51:48] thank god for the prophet of malachi 4.
[51:52] god sent a prophet
[51:54] to me
[51:55] according to malachi 4.
[51:58] if someone doesn't believe it
[52:01] i have nothing to do for them but i
[52:04] believe
[52:05] because malakai fought five to six has
[52:07] to be fulfilled
[52:11] there had to be a prophet to come why
[52:13] did not power
[52:14] you know
[52:15] for around the first coming of jesus
[52:17] christ
[52:20] then there was another
[52:22] woman who is to come you know
[52:25] the second coming
[52:28] that is
[53:14] for you to qualify to be a prophet of
[53:16] god
[53:18] it means the word of god qualifies to
[53:20] come to you
[53:24] the word of god
[54:30] three uh manifestations of of christ as
[54:34] a son
[54:36] christopher
[54:51] our daughter now jesus yes as a son of
[54:55] of god of man
[54:58] who was a prophet
[55:02] he was the one
[55:17] [Music]
[55:33] he he said he was not yeah
[55:36] but he denied naught
[55:38] meaning
[55:39] john the baptist
[55:42] indeed he was not elijah yeah yeah yeah
[55:45] but he had the spirit of the life
[56:14] revealing himself in flesh
[56:17] god manifested in flesh
[56:21] and god in flesh he came as a prophet
[56:27] because a prophet
[57:10] you did not come to prophesy the secular
[57:14] something which you couldn't do
[57:17] the others prophesied and said that that
[57:20] saith the lord
[57:23] jesus said very very
[58:05] he would do the miracles
[58:42] [Music]
[58:48] and this
[59:03] done i mulited your navy nakola and she
[59:05] said isn't this the very messiah
[59:11] meaning
[59:13] she and others knew oh
[59:15] i never never even when she
[59:30] and jesus
[59:44] what
[59:56] but what dispensation are we in really
[1:00:01] chicago we are at a time pretty much
[1:00:03] when now he has progressed from just
[1:00:07] being a son of man
[1:00:08] what the
[1:00:11] to being a son of god
[1:00:14] as a son of god no man in catholic he is
[1:00:16] now the holy ghost
[1:00:20] and that progression
[1:00:22] started on the day of pentecost
[1:01:37] jesus son of david yes
[1:01:41] he is
[1:01:42] a king
[1:01:44] let me correct myself connected okay
[1:01:48] who was promised hey as soon as the one
[1:02:19] listen kev what do you know about
[1:02:20] genders
[1:02:22] he promised yes
[1:02:27] someone quickly opened whatever
[1:02:30] matthew 17 mata yesterday
[1:02:45] what does it say
[1:02:58] brother are you there
[1:03:42] up
[1:03:56] oh
[1:04:38] and what
[1:04:52] we know jesus 20 years outside of man
[1:04:56] son of david
[1:04:57] with the son of god
[1:04:59] we know he has already finished his
[1:05:01] office as a son of man
[1:05:06] who is the son of man
[1:05:08] he is a prophet
[1:05:11] if you read the book of the bible
[1:05:13] he tells us
[1:05:17] a prophet
[1:05:19] so we see him
[1:05:34] will be
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:47] shall be revealed again
[1:06:30] when
[1:08:23] and we have seen that ministry
[1:08:24] everybody's opportunity i've seen a man
[1:08:26] come on the platform
[1:08:30] would speak they're helpless
[1:08:34] i would say i've only preached to you
[1:08:38] but i can't make anything happen
[1:08:41] i have to wait for him
[1:08:43] the son of man
[1:08:45] like you are waiting for him
[1:08:47] and when he comes question he will do
[1:08:50] the watch
[1:09:19] and and he would say now you'll get up
[1:09:22] now i gotta catch he is here why
[1:09:26] not
[1:09:27] the holy spirit
[1:09:29] is here while he chooses and he can be
[1:09:32] touched
[1:09:34] by the feelings
[1:09:38] have faith but who killed that point he
[1:09:40] said he said i have nothing to do with
[1:09:42] it
[1:09:44] is here what would i do and if you have
[1:09:46] enough faith
[1:09:48] he will call you out i can't quite
[1:09:52] and that would be a heart
[1:09:55] and the moment you would come and that
[1:09:57] would help you listen to the message
[1:10:00] he
[1:10:14] and after that moment
[1:10:17] he said there is no
[1:10:19] life nagaman
[1:10:21] that would be hidden
[1:10:27] if you are there
[1:10:41] or something like that
[1:11:35] who was a lunatic or something like
[1:11:38] anything would have a
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:15] [Music]
[1:12:27] and there are many countless countless
[1:12:29] countless countless
[1:12:31] things that happened one would have
[1:12:32] intervened yes
[1:13:30] people's names were called your
[1:13:32] government to guide you from me to

[1:14:14] was after he was preaching
[1:14:18] about that angel commander
[1:14:22] that came
