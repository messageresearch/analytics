[24:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you church. Let us turn to our
[24:39] Bible to the book of Matthew
[24:42] [Music]
[24:45] verse seven.
[24:56] We read this on Sunday. I'm just going
[24:58] to read it for perhaps the people who
[25:00] did not follow on Sunday.
[25:08] Chapter 7 vers 13
[25:12] &gt;&gt; and 14.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Enter ye in at the straight gate. For
[25:18] wide is the gate, and broad is the way
[25:20] that leadth to destruction, and many
[25:22] there be which go in there. Because
[25:25] straight is the gate, and narrow is the
[25:26] way which leadth unto life, and few
[25:29] there be that find it.
[25:33] [Music]
[25:52] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[25:56] Amen. Many of our students are back to
[25:58] school now.
[26:02] And uh I was you know this this um this
[26:05] evening this this evening I was just
[26:07] texting I received a text from brother
[26:10] polyup
[26:13] telling me I can't wait for the service
[26:15] I can't wait for the service
[26:20] I know he's
[26:23] praise God
[26:26] amen to
[26:31] Brother Brian.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; So this evening I just want to speak on
[26:36] the narrow way. I I we spoke on this on
[26:37] Sunday
[26:41] and um I promised that I would finish it
[26:43] today. But let's see how the Holy Spirit
[26:44] would inspire us if we finishing it. I'm
[26:46] not too sure.
[26:51] The narrow way is the is the subject.
[26:56] This scripture here is very significant
[27:00] because it was given to us by our Lord
[27:04] as he was warning us of the false
[27:05] prophets
[27:07] in sheep's clothing.
[27:09] Our enemy is not the one that is
[27:12] without.
[27:14] But our enemy is the one that is within.
[27:18] The enemy of the church is not coming.
[27:21] The enemy of the church is here.
[27:24] And if you read the church age book,
[27:27] you understand that brother Bham spoke
[27:29] about the two seeds.
[27:32] Um in some places he calls them the two
[27:34] vines,
[27:36] other places he calls them the um uh the
[27:39] two spirits.
[27:42] And then he says that this is within the
[27:44] framework
[27:45] [Music]
[27:48] of the of the Christian church
[27:52] talking about the false vine and the
[27:53] true vine.
[27:55] And so then somewhere else in the church
[27:58] age book, brother Bam now begins to ex
[28:00] explain
[28:03] how a believer can be able to overcome.
[28:07] And he says that a believer will only be
[28:09] able to overcome
[28:13] If she can be able by the spirit of God
[28:15] to discern
[28:19] the the the right spirit from the wrong
[28:22] the wrong spirit
[28:25] and um he he said that if she can be
[28:27] able to discern the true church and the
[28:29] false church.
[28:34] He then says that she will be invisible
[28:36] before the devil.
[28:40] Praise God.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Let me just get this for you. I did not
[28:45] plan to read it, but uh it just came to
[28:46] me as I'm just starting right now.
[28:51] Listen. He says um he knows this is the
[28:53] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[28:56] He says he cannot the devil cannot stand
[28:58] revelation
[29:01] of the true church. And please if you
[29:04] can follow me please
[29:07] because we usually have a very little
[29:09] time on Wednesday
[29:12] but you know he cannot stand revelation
[29:16] the the revelation of the true
[29:17] revelation of the true church
[29:20] and what she is and what she stands for
[29:25] and that she can do the greater works.
[29:28] And then he says um let me go back a
[29:32] little bit and he says uh that this book
[29:34] of revelation reveals and exposes Satan
[29:41] reveals his attempted destruction of
[29:43] God's people.
[29:49] The devil has always wanted to discredit
[29:51] God's people.
[29:54] [Music]
[29:55] Always. By the way, the spirit that
[29:58] would discredit
[30:00] God's people is a spirit of Satan.
[30:06] But the spirit of Christ will never
[30:10] discredit a brother.
[30:14] A spirit of Christ will always lift up a
[30:16] brother.
[30:19] Will always bless and not curse.
[30:22] Praise God. Amen. Even when that brother
[30:25] you think is wrong,
[30:28] even when that brother you think has
[30:30] gone astray,
[30:33] if you have the spirit of Christ in you,
[30:36] you have the love for that brother and
[30:39] you want to lift him up and you want to
[30:42] bless him and not curse.
[30:44] But the spirit of Satan
[30:47] will has always been desiring to destroy
[30:50] God's people
[30:53] to discredit the word of God.
[30:57] You see, you see, he cannot stand it,
[31:00] he knows that. And then let me go down
[31:03] now. If they get the people, the
[31:06] believers, the true believers, if they
[31:07] get a true revelation
[31:11] of two spirits
[31:14] within the framework of the Christian
[31:16] church,
[31:19] our enemy is not coming.
[31:22] Our enemy is within.
[31:24] And this is right at the beginning of
[31:26] the church age.
[31:30] I'll just show it to you. I hope you
[31:31] you'll be able to get it tonight.
[31:34] Praise God. And and and he says um if
[31:38] they get a true revelation of the two
[31:40] spirits within the framework of the
[31:41] Christian church
[31:44] [Music]
[31:47] and by God's spirit discern and
[31:50] withstand the antichrist spirit.
[31:57] So the antichrist spirit
[32:00] is not coming. is already within the
[32:03] framework of the Christian church.
[32:10] So a true believer should have the
[32:13] discernment
[32:15] and know the wrong spirit
[32:19] from the right one. You cannot know only
[32:22] by discernment.
[32:27] By godly spirit discern,
[32:30] not only discern but withstand
[32:35] the antichrist spirit.
[32:38] So there is a spirit which is against
[32:40] Christ
[32:43] and Bam said anything that is anti-word
[32:45] is antichrist
[32:49] and that spirit is within the framework
[32:51] of Christianity.
[32:54] He says if the true church can be able
[32:55] to discern it
[32:59] satan will be powerless
[33:02] before her. Yes.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[33:05] And so when you talk about the narrow
[33:07] way,
[33:09] the narrow way is the way of those that
[33:11] have discerned the spirit of the
[33:13] antichrist.
[33:19] They have known the antichrist.
[33:22] They have discerned it. They have found
[33:24] it out and have been able by God's grace
[33:27] to withstand it
[33:30] and they walking in the narrow way.
[33:34] But the broad way, the big way, the
[33:38] Bible says many find it.
[33:41] It seems be it seems right. That's why
[33:44] many find it.
[33:47] And and and you know, many walk there
[33:49] again.
[33:50] But we know the ends thereof is the ways
[33:52] of.
[33:55] Then he says, "Straight is the gate
[33:58] and narrow is the way which leadth unto
[34:02] life and few there are be that find it."
[34:06] And the prophet preached a sermon one in
[34:07] a million.
[34:11] Not all claim to be Christians
[34:14] are going in the rapture. Not who claim
[34:16] all who claim to be the bride
[34:19] are going in the rapture. It's only one
[34:21] in a million.
[34:24] They are the ones walking in a narrow
[34:26] way.
[34:28] They are the ones who have designed the
[34:29] wrong spirit
[34:31] and they are walking in the narrow path.
[34:35] I believe I am one of them. You are one
[34:38] of them tonight.
[34:40] Amen. And now I wanted to show you that
[34:44] Jude
[34:46] Jude actually Jude exposes and I I I try
[34:51] to give you a a summary on Sunday.
[34:54] [Music]
[34:56] how Jude was one of the people that did
[34:58] not believe in Jesus as such as when he
[35:00] was alive.
[35:05] Most of the natural brothers of Jesus
[35:06] did not.
[35:09] But you see after his ascension
[35:13] of course death, resurrection and
[35:15] ascension
[35:17] they now believed on him. and and Jude,
[35:20] if you see when Jude begins to write,
[35:25] he's defending the Lord.
[35:28] And um his words are very powerful.
[35:32] He was about false teachers.
[35:34] He was talking against antichrist
[35:36] spirit.
[35:38] He was talking against the broad way or
[35:40] the big way or the wide way.
[35:43] And he was pointing people to the narrow
[35:44] way.
[35:46] May God help us to walk in a narrow way.
[35:50] Right at the beginning here in Jude,
[35:54] Jude begins to say these words
[35:57] uh in verses three,
[35:59] &gt;&gt; beloved, when I gave all diligence to
[36:02] write unto you the common salvation,
[36:05] it was needful for me to write unto you
[36:07] and exalt you that you should earnestly
[36:10] contend for the faith which was once
[36:12] delivered unto the saints.
[36:25] contend for the faith.
[36:27] But is are people contending for the
[36:29] faith anymore?
[36:32] People are no longer contending for the
[36:33] faith.
[36:35] They contending for other things like
[36:37] religion,
[36:39] their groups, their denominations, their
[36:41] ideas, but not the faith. But Jud is
[36:45] saying content for the faith.
[36:48] Amen. Which was once delivered unto the
[36:51] saints.
[36:53] For there are certain men
[36:57] crept in unawares.
[37:01] Now Jude begins to unveil the antichrist
[37:04] spirit
[37:08] and he says there are men. They are not
[37:11] out there. They are not out there
[37:15] but they are among us.
[37:17] And he says these are certain men who
[37:19] cropped in unawares
[37:22] who were before of old ordained to this
[37:25] condemnation
[37:28] and godly men
[37:30] turning the grace of God into
[37:32] lasciviousness
[37:35] and denying the only Lord God
[37:38] and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:41] Now Jude goes ahead
[37:44] and he explains and he gives us three
[37:47] examples
[37:50] which we can now use
[37:53] to be able to know who those men are.
[37:57] He gives he gave us three examples from
[38:00] the Old Testament which we in the New
[38:02] Testament can also use to be able to
[38:06] know who are.
[38:09] Praise God.
[38:11] And and if you want to look at it, you
[38:12] can go to vers 8.
[38:16] Okay? He gives us those three examples 8
[38:18] to 13. Let us try to read.
[38:22] Likewise also these filthy dreamers,
[38:28] defile the flesh, despising dominion,
[38:31] and speak evil of dignities.
[38:39] Verse n. Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Yet Michael the archangel when
[38:43] contending with the devil, he disputed
[38:45] about the body of Moses dust not bring
[38:47] against him a railing accusation, but
[38:49] said, "The Lord rebuke thee.
[39:02] But now verse 10 says, "But these men,
[39:05] these
[39:06] evil of those things which they know
[39:08] not,
[39:10] but what they know naturally as brute
[39:13] beasts, in those things they corrupt
[39:15] themselves,
[39:16] [Music]
[39:20] war unto them, for they have gone in the
[39:24] way of Cain,
[39:26] and ran greedly after the era of Balam.
[39:30] for the reward and perish in the gain
[39:33] sayings of Kora.
[39:37] Right there are your three examples.
[39:40] You see, as I told you on Wednesday or
[39:43] on Sunday, the whole book of Jude warns
[39:46] us about these false teachers
[39:49] and ungodly men who creep into the
[39:51] church,
[39:54] turning the grace of God into sin.
[39:58] denying the Lord.
[40:00] You see verses 10 and 11 as we have read
[40:04] it
[40:06] because it compares them to the Old
[40:09] Testament examples
[40:13] and on Sunday we extensively looked at
[40:15] the first one
[40:17] being Cain
[40:19] because he said war unto them for they
[40:22] have gone in the way of Cain.
[40:25] So the way of Cain,
[40:28] are you following me? Church represents
[40:31] false worship.
[40:34] Coming to God with your own idea
[40:38] instead of God's revealed idea or
[40:40] sacrifice.
[40:44] Those who go by the way of Cain,
[40:47] they choose their own idea
[40:51] which is their own religion
[40:54] without revelation.
[40:56] I want you to understand what religion
[40:57] is.
[40:59] Religion is your idea
[41:02] that is uh is without revelation of the
[41:05] word.
[41:07] That is religion. And it doesn't matter
[41:10] what you claim to believe.
[41:13] As long as it is not the revelation of
[41:15] the word,
[41:18] you are just having a religion.
[41:21] But this message come to deliver us from
[41:24] the religion.
[41:26] Amen. Out of religion. He said come out
[41:28] of her people. Amen. Be not partakers of
[41:32] our sin.
[41:34] We are joined with what? with Christ
[41:38] by religion, by not religion but by
[41:40] revelation.
[41:43] You know what were you baptized into?
[41:46] You were not baptized into this church.
[41:50] You are not a member physical member of
[41:52] this church by water baptism
[41:57] but you are baptized into the body.
[42:02] The Bible says by one spirit
[42:06] by one spirit. Where is the body of
[42:09] Christ?
[42:10] Where is the church? We are talking
[42:11] about is the one we call the church
[42:14] triumphant.
[42:16] We here in DVF are just a little
[42:19] representation
[42:22] of that body.
[42:25] You know talks calls it the mystical
[42:27] body.
[42:30] It is all over the world.
[42:33] And you know we we all are born into
[42:35] that.
[42:37] We don't join the body by a handshake
[42:41] by water baptism by all these other
[42:44] things as much as they are all good. We
[42:47] we are born into the body
[42:51] by a birth
[42:53] holy ghost baptism.
[42:55] When you receive the word and you're
[42:57] born again then you become a member of
[43:00] that body.
[43:02] Amen. And you know there are many
[43:04] members of that group and they all over
[43:07] the world. We are just a little piece of
[43:10] them.
[43:13] We are not the whole body but we are the
[43:15] real body.
[43:18] We together with all of them
[43:20] are the body of Christ on earth.
[43:23] So when when when we are having victory
[43:25] here
[43:27] it is the body of Christ having victory.
[43:30] When our brothers in another church
[43:33] who are the body of Christ are having
[43:36] victory, amen, we are having victory.
[43:40] Their victory is our victory. Our
[43:42] victory is their victory. And brother
[43:44] Bham said elect cannot persecute elect.
[43:50] Amen. Praise God. But you see the way of
[43:54] Cain
[43:56] will never go by revelation.
[43:59] Amen. The way of Kane will always go by
[44:01] religion.
[44:03] God, receive me the way I am according
[44:06] to what I believe. Accept my way of
[44:09] worship.
[44:10] Accept my way even if it's not exactly
[44:13] what you desire.
[44:17] Receive me the way I am. That's the way
[44:20] of Cain.
[44:21] [Music]
[44:22] No revelation,
[44:25] no blood sacrifice,
[44:27] you know, but the bride
[44:29] You know she has revelation.
[44:32] She's okay
[44:34] to to be made by the blood.
[44:38] Amen. We are happy to get soaked in the
[44:40] water.
[44:44] Let me tell you brothers and sisters,
[44:46] the bride loves the word.
[44:49] If you want to know who the bride is,
[44:52] you will know them by how they love the
[44:55] world.
[44:57] Amen. Peter spoke unto him and he said
[45:00] to whom shall we go who has the words of
[45:03] a power?
[45:06] We are not staying because of miracles.
[45:09] We are not staying because of signs and
[45:11] wonders. We are not saying yeah we know
[45:13] you made them. You made a fish
[45:19] and we loved it. But for us we are
[45:22] staying here not because of those
[45:24] miracles. When the miracles have dried
[45:27] up, we are staying here because of the
[45:31] revelation
[45:32] that we have of the word. And you know
[45:36] what? The revelation of the word. They
[45:39] now had to understand.
[45:42] It was not something they had got.
[45:46] It was something that they had received.
[45:54] It was a person.
[45:56] They were with him. To him he came among
[45:59] his own but they rejected him but was
[46:02] many received him. To them gave him
[46:06] power to become the son.
[46:10] Amen. And now we know he was the light.
[46:14] He came and shined in the darkness but
[46:16] the darkness loved the darkness
[46:20] more than the light.
[46:23] Jesus is the light of the world.
[46:25] And now he speaks to them and he says
[46:27] who do you think I am? And then they
[46:30] said by revelation
[46:33] you are Jesus
[46:35] the son of the living God. You know he
[46:38] asked them and he said who do you think
[46:41] I the son of man?
[46:45] The son of man is a human being.
[46:48] And they said okay as a human being they
[46:50] call you a prophet.
[46:52] And he said, "Okay, but what about you?
[46:55] Do you think I'm also a human being?"
[46:58] Peter was just right there. But
[47:00] something struck him. The same thing
[47:02] that struck.
[47:04] It was revelation. Amen. Oh, we love
[47:08] revelation.
[47:10] The bride overcomes by revelation.
[47:13] Brother, you need revelation.
[47:16] If you need to pray for anything, pray
[47:18] that God will give you revelation.
[47:22] Because if you do everything by
[47:23] revelation,
[47:25] you will understand. I mean, it's not
[47:28] about you. It's not about the brother.
[47:32] It's about what God has done
[47:35] in you and in your brother.
[47:39] Revelation. And Peter said,
[47:42] "For you are the son of the living God."
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus looked at him. You didn't call me
[47:51] a son of man. You didn't call me a human
[47:54] being. You saw me as a human being. But
[47:57] you looked beyond the bad skin.
[48:01] You looked beyond the flesh
[48:04] and you saw me as God.
[48:08] Of course, son of cow is cow.
[48:12] Son of God is God. Son of man is man.
[48:15] But son of God
[48:17] is God.
[48:19] Hallelujah. Peter had received
[48:22] not from flesh and blood. And Jesus knew
[48:27] that Peter had heard from Ethiopia.
[48:31] And and Jesus said unto him, "Oh Peter,
[48:34] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[48:37] this, but my father in heaven, upon this
[48:42] rock, upon this revelation,
[48:46] I will build my church."
[48:48] So the church of Jesus is built upon
[48:51] revelation.
[48:53] Hallelujah. Amen. The revelation
[48:56] of who Jesus Christ is.
[49:01] And I told you when you receive the
[49:02] revelation of who Jesus Christ is,
[49:07] then you receive the revelation of who
[49:09] you are.
[49:14] If you have a revelation that Jesus is
[49:17] God, then you will understand. He had
[49:20] God put on flesh
[49:23] and he died like a man
[49:26] so that you a man will overcome as God.
[49:31] Hallelujah.
[49:34] Banam says this. He became you
[49:38] that you may become him.
[49:41] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Christ is a mystery of God today.
[49:48] Amen. Do you believe that?
[49:50] You are the mystery of Christ.
[49:54] Amen. We are here not to reveal our
[49:57] frailty.
[50:00] That God has given us the revelation of
[50:02] the word
[50:03] that he may reveal our power, our
[50:05] strength, our omnipotence.
[50:11] That's the mystery which was hid from
[50:14] ages which was hid from generations but
[50:17] now it has been made manifest
[50:21] Christ in you
[50:23] the hope of glory
[50:25] you know in the message Christ is the
[50:27] myster of God revealed
[50:31] that is a three-fold purpose
[50:37] and the third one he said that he might
[50:39] have preeminence
[50:42] in the body of believers.
[50:46] When he's in you, he wants to have
[50:49] preeminence.
[50:51] You don't struggle with sin anymore.
[50:55] Because you see, if he's in you, he does
[50:57] the works.
[50:59] He lives the life. He overcome. He will
[51:03] change his body.
[51:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see the narrow way of
[51:12] revelation.
[51:13] You know whenever I talk about
[51:14] revelation
[51:16] I become very excited.
[51:18] Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Because you see that's our victory.
[51:23] Remember the woman at the well how she
[51:26] was before she received the revelation.
[51:29] But you see as she was speaking to
[51:31] Jesus,
[51:32] you know, and and Jesus said, I that
[51:35] speaketh to you, I am he
[51:39] because he was talking about giving you
[51:40] the waters
[51:43] which when you drink them become thirsty
[51:45] again. And you know if you knew only the
[51:49] kind of waters I would give and as and
[51:52] as they converse that woman
[51:56] something sparked
[52:00] and and you know what
[52:02] she's threw her water picture down.
[52:07] You know when revelation strikes you
[52:10] throw down some some anger you had with
[52:11] you.
[52:15] When revelation strikes, you just
[52:17] receive love all of a sudden.
[52:21] I don't believe the love we have to love
[52:22] our brothers with
[52:25] is a human love.
[52:30] God knows that our human love is
[52:33] insufficient.
[52:35] That's why he has to give us divine
[52:37] love.
[52:40] Divine love comes by revelation.
[52:44] when it strikes you makes you love
[52:46] everybody.
[52:48] Hallelujah.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; And and it struck this woman. I want you
[52:52] to notice what she did. She threw a
[52:54] water picture. That is her old
[52:58] revelation.
[53:01] She came to this water source
[53:05] to to fetch water. This is what she
[53:08] knew. This is what she had done for
[53:10] years. But when the revelation struck
[53:13] her,
[53:14] She threw the old revelation.
[53:17] Hallelujah. She threw the old waters.
[53:21] She said, "I don't need this
[53:22] denomination anymore.
[53:25] I don't need this religion anymore. I am
[53:27] set free."
[53:30] Hallelujah. Amen. The waters I now have.
[53:35] Amen. I cannot carry them in this little
[53:37] be.
[53:39] I've received it all over my heart.
[53:43] flowing like a river.
[53:45] Let me go to the whole city and I will
[53:50] tell them, hallelujah, I have found a
[53:53] man that has told me everything that
[53:56] I've ever done.
[53:59] You know what? Something was bubbling in
[54:02] her mind.
[54:04] And that's how it is when someone
[54:06] receives revelation.
[54:08] Well, yeah, you might say, "Brother,
[54:10] sounds like the Holy Spirit.
[54:13] It sounds like the Holy Spirit.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's true. Because you cannot
[54:18] receive the Holy Spirit
[54:20] without revelation.
[54:22] With a revelation, one day I remember I
[54:24] was walking with brothers
[54:27] on the road as we were moving. And we're
[54:30] talking about the Holy Spirit and how a
[54:32] man can receive the Holy Spirit. What
[54:34] happens when you receive the Holy
[54:35] Spirit? As we were talking, you know,
[54:38] I'm walking down. So you mean that the
[54:41] Holy Spirit is Christless.
[54:43] So how do you receive it? When you
[54:45] believe it and you believe the word, the
[54:48] full word, then you are entitled.
[54:53] Not no no no no no no not not it's not
[54:55] about you.
[54:57] You are entitled
[55:00] to receive the Holy Spirit.
[55:03] That's what the prophet say and said oh
[55:05] just like that. He said as simple as
[55:07] that. Even now as we are walking
[55:11] and you know as
[55:13] you know in just a second he became
[55:17] drunk right now.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And started rejoicing and shouting
[55:22] speaking in just on the road.
[55:26] Brothers let me tell you this is real.
[55:30] The revelation when it strikes you
[55:33] cannot remain the same.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our our faith is not a religion.
[55:40] We don't just join church. We don't just
[55:42] do a ritual. We are not just members. We
[55:45] are more than members.
[55:48] We have to be born into a family by
[55:51] revelation. Spiritual revelation
[55:54] that comes from God. And when it strikes
[55:57] your heart,
[55:59] you will be like Abel. You'll be like
[56:01] Seth. You will worship the Lord. Praise
[56:05] God. And brother says that the word from
[56:08] the beginning God's plan
[56:11] was revealed by revelation.
[56:15] The very thing that he vindicated and
[56:17] punctuated that that was right.
[56:23] Not religion, not not the altar, not
[56:27] belonging to a church, not not the
[56:29] altar,
[56:33] not making a sacrifice, not being
[56:35] sincere. And I told you that someone can
[56:38] be sincere
[56:40] but sincerely wrong.
[56:42] but by revelation of the word.
[56:45] That was God's plan from the beginning.
[56:50] God always gives his word
[56:53] by spiritual revelation.
[56:56] That's why when you are hearing a
[56:57] preacher preach,
[57:00] you receive revelation.
[57:01] Now you know why we have a church
[57:03] service.
[57:05] Faith comes by.
[57:09] What is faith?
[57:11] said faith is everything.
[57:14] Amen. Now you know what faith is. He's
[57:17] not saying right feeling
[57:22] is a revelation which comes by hearing
[57:24] the word. Hallelujah.
[57:28] Amen. And it is in the spir of a moment
[57:32] then something is revealed. That's why
[57:34] you begin shouting and you say amen.
[57:38] That's what happened to sister right.
[57:41] And when brother was talking about the
[57:42] scripture and she said brother that's
[57:46] nothing but the truth
[57:49] said amen she said the right word by
[57:52] revelation
[57:54] and now by revelation also God came to
[57:58] brother
[57:59] ask her whatever she wants she will get.
[58:03] Brother said even if she had asked for
[58:06] $1 million
[58:08] in that moment she would get it whatever
[58:11] she would have asked for. Why? Because
[58:14] it was not by human ability.
[58:18] It was not by you know like praying
[58:20] praying hard.
[58:22] It was not by a worked up faith.
[58:25] It was by revelation
[58:27] because she had received the revelation.
[58:30] She said amen.
[58:32] And then brother Bham
[58:34] &gt;&gt; was moved by the Holy Ghost and by
[58:37] revelation also spoke to her ask
[58:40] whatsoever you want.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the Holy Spirit knew what
[58:44] she wanted.
[58:46] Amen. And and you know she could not say
[58:48] anything
[58:50] let me tell you if I ask you by the
[58:53] flesh to ask whatever you you need
[58:57] and you by the flesh you ask what you
[59:00] need.
[59:02] nothing will happen. But if it's by
[59:04] revelation I ask you
[59:07] and you by revelation
[59:09] I assure you
[59:12] in that moment you cannot even you
[59:15] cannot even ask for what you thought you
[59:16] needed
[59:20] you remember later
[59:22] I asked for that one because revelation
[59:27] is not your mind
[59:30] not your thought
[59:32] is the thought of the Holy Ghost.
[59:35] Peter said you are Jesus the son of God.
[59:39] That was not his thought that came from
[59:41] above. Jesus said it has come from
[59:44] above. So even sister
[59:47] that came from above. He said I want the
[59:50] salvation of my body.
[59:52] He said you can have it.
[59:56] Oh brother, if revelation can strike us,
[1:00:00] we can create another world. If
[1:00:02] revelation can strike us now, we will
[1:00:05] forgive our enemies. If revelation can
[1:00:08] strike us now, we shall live in power as
[1:00:11] sons of God, daughters of God.
[1:00:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. But
[1:00:19] the problem with us these men they crept
[1:00:22] in
[1:00:24] and they tried to replace revelation
[1:00:28] with religion with altars
[1:00:32] with church
[1:00:34] sacrifice sincerity
[1:00:37] my church my religion my altar my pastor
[1:00:42] my sacrifice I have given too much I
[1:00:45] have given this I've given this off
[1:00:48] should do this for
[1:00:49] No,
[1:00:51] he does not look at any of those.
[1:00:54] When the angel of God comes,
[1:00:58] he's searching for one thing,
[1:01:00] revelation.
[1:01:03] And if you have it,
[1:01:05] Amen. then he's pleased.
[1:01:08] The Bible says without faith, without
[1:01:12] revelation, it is impossible
[1:01:15] to please God.
[1:01:17] So if you want to please God, just have
[1:01:20] revelation.
[1:01:21] Even what I'm preaching right now, don't
[1:01:24] receive it by the flesh.
[1:01:27] Please, you know, when a preacher is
[1:01:28] preaching,
[1:01:30] never hear things and filter them in
[1:01:32] your mind.
[1:01:34] That's why you can even do those because
[1:01:37] you are hearing in the flesh.
[1:01:40] Even a preacher should not preach in the
[1:01:41] flesh.
[1:01:44] You know,
[1:01:48] says that the demon has come over you.
[1:01:51] Have you ever seen a person
[1:01:55] the demon has come? They don't speak as
[1:01:58] them something.
[1:02:00] The demon is seated on them. They will
[1:02:03] speak and even swing
[1:02:07] and everybody will listen. Others who
[1:02:09] listen
[1:02:11] the ones who listen must listen in the
[1:02:13] same spirit.
[1:02:20] That is the same way it is in the
[1:02:21] spirit. We don't fight against flesh and
[1:02:24] blood.
[1:02:25] To understand the things of the spirit,
[1:02:27] you have to come out of flesh. Come out
[1:02:30] of blood. Amen. The word is preached by
[1:02:33] revelation.
[1:02:35] Amen. Get drunk in the spirit. Receive
[1:02:39] it by revelation.
[1:02:41] Receive it by revelation.
[1:02:43] And you see that's how then it is
[1:02:45] applied upon your life
[1:02:49] but Cain received it cannally
[1:02:52] and he refused revelation and that's why
[1:02:55] God never accepted
[1:02:58] and his sacrifice did not please God.
[1:03:01] Oh may God help us that we might always
[1:03:04] have revelation.
[1:03:06] You've always heard people say, "Oh, the
[1:03:09] pastor talked against me." That's
[1:03:11] because they heard the word in the
[1:03:12] flesh.
[1:03:15] You've always seen ministers who will
[1:03:17] change their sermon because of the
[1:03:20] situation.
[1:03:21] Hey preacher, preach by inspiration,
[1:03:26] not by situation.
[1:03:28] Amen. Then you can be sure you are
[1:03:31] preaching by revelation.
[1:03:34] May God have mercy on us.
[1:03:36] Now there's a lot we can talk about uh
[1:03:39] uh you know that first one
[1:03:42] the way of Cain but we talked about on
[1:03:45] Sunday. So let's also now talk about the
[1:03:47] way of Balam
[1:03:50] because the second one is said the error
[1:03:52] they go after the error of Balam for
[1:03:56] reward.
[1:04:01] Anyone who walks the way of Balam
[1:04:04] is not walking in the narrow way.
[1:04:07] He represents greed and compromise.
[1:04:10] A prophet who loved the reward and tried
[1:04:13] to curse Israel.
[1:04:16] Those who follow Balam are preachers who
[1:04:18] sell the word for money and popularity.
[1:04:25] In the book of Revelation
[1:04:27] chapter two, he speaks about them. And
[1:04:30] he says, "Because thou hast them that
[1:04:32] hold a doctrine of Balam,
[1:04:37] who taught Balac to cast a stumbling
[1:04:39] block before the children of Israel,
[1:04:43] to eat things sacrificed unto idols
[1:04:46] and to commit fornication."
[1:04:49] You know if a man or woman is having or
[1:04:53] under the influence of the spirit of
[1:04:55] balam
[1:04:59] they will do anything
[1:05:02] say anything
[1:05:04] for material gain
[1:05:07] you see balam
[1:05:09] when balac came and told him
[1:05:12] you remember on Sunday I gave you
[1:05:13] details
[1:05:16] of balam
[1:05:18] and balac
[1:05:19] And we saw that these people
[1:05:22] were really related to because they were
[1:05:24] Moabites.
[1:05:27] They were related to Abraham.
[1:05:31] Amen. And I wish I can go back into the
[1:05:33] details, but because of time
[1:05:36] I may not go there. But um you know this
[1:05:40] this man tried to do everything
[1:05:44] even when conscious was coming back to
[1:05:46] him. Remember
[1:05:49] the reward.
[1:05:53] You should never serve God for reward.
[1:06:00] The moment you do,
[1:06:02] you've gone into the way of battle.
[1:06:05] I'm not saying that God doesn't reward
[1:06:06] himself,
[1:06:08] but we don't suffer for reward.
[1:06:13] Amen.
[1:06:15] Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let me just try to read for
[1:06:19] you a little through in the PGA church
[1:06:21] age. If you're going to understand what
[1:06:23] a doctrine of balum is
[1:06:26] in the Old Testament church, we had
[1:06:29] better go back and see what it was in
[1:06:30] the Old Testament church
[1:06:34] and then we applied.
[1:06:37] Okay, they were the Pentecostals of
[1:06:39] their day
[1:06:41] is speaking of the Israelites. They had
[1:06:44] taken refuge under the blood.
[1:06:47] They had all been baptized in the Red
[1:06:49] Sea.
[1:06:50] And they came up out of the water
[1:06:52] singing in the spirit
[1:06:54] and dancing under the energy of the Holy
[1:06:56] Ghost.
[1:06:58] While Miriam the prophet has played hard
[1:07:00] tambber
[1:07:03] now. The the the Pentecostal bunch is
[1:07:06] coming
[1:07:08] led, you know, by by the by the spirit
[1:07:11] of God
[1:07:13] through their messenger.
[1:07:15] and they wanted to go through Moab.
[1:07:19] So, Israel came up to the borders of
[1:07:20] Moab
[1:07:22] and sent messengers to the king
[1:07:25] saying, "We are brothers."
[1:07:28] Remember I told you that these came from
[1:07:29] Lord,
[1:07:32] you know, from the from the union of
[1:07:34] Lord and daughters
[1:07:37] and and so they knew the truth,
[1:07:41] but they did not believe it. So we are
[1:07:43] brothers. Let us pass through your land.
[1:07:47] If if our people or our animals eat or
[1:07:50] drink anything, we will gladly pay for
[1:07:51] it.
[1:07:54] But King Balac got very excited.
[1:07:58] That head of that Nicolant bunch was not
[1:08:00] about to let the church come through
[1:08:02] with its signs and wonders and diverse
[1:08:04] manifestation of the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:13] with their faces shining with.
[1:08:17] Amen. It was too risky
[1:08:20] as he might lose some of his crowd.
[1:08:24] You know the Nicolantan bunch
[1:08:28] were the nonbelievers
[1:08:31] who did not believe in the Holy Ghost
[1:08:33] move
[1:08:35] and they were afraid of the people who
[1:08:38] were moving by and through the Holy
[1:08:41] Ghost.
[1:08:45] So Balac refused to let Israel pass
[1:08:48] through.
[1:08:50] In fact, great was his fear of them
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; that he went on our hearing uh and
[1:08:56] hearing prophet called Balam and asked
[1:08:58] him to mediate between him and God
[1:09:04] and and petitioned the Almighty to cast
[1:09:06] Israel
[1:09:09] and to render them important.
[1:09:12] And and you can now see I told you as we
[1:09:13] were beginning how this first group
[1:09:15] always will want to kill destroy the
[1:09:19] right group.
[1:09:23] And Balam being eager to take part in
[1:09:26] political affairs and become a great
[1:09:28] man,
[1:09:34] he was only too glad to do so.
[1:09:38] But seeing that he had to approach he he
[1:09:40] had to approach to and receive an
[1:09:41] audience from God to get the people cast
[1:09:47] because he couldn't do it by himself.
[1:09:50] He went to ask God if he could have his
[1:09:52] permission to go.
[1:09:55] Isn't that just like the Nicolantes we
[1:09:57] have with us today?
[1:10:00] They curse everyone that won't go their
[1:10:03] way.
[1:10:07] God bless you DVF.
[1:10:09] They c everyone
[1:10:12] and won't come to DVF.
[1:10:15] They c everyone and go won't go to their
[1:10:17] group.
[1:10:19] Remember that's the Nicol.
[1:10:23] But I'm so glad that in this message we
[1:10:26] do not have a Nicolantan bunch.
[1:10:31] You remember brother Bam said that when
[1:10:32] they begin to denominate
[1:10:36] and then they say we are the right ones
[1:10:41] the others are wrong
[1:10:43] and then they begin to become
[1:10:44] indifferent.
[1:10:46] Say we believe this and this and this
[1:10:48] and this and this. Anyone who believes
[1:10:50] something beyond this
[1:10:53] is wrong. But the message of the hour,
[1:10:57] listen friends, the message of the hour
[1:11:01] has liberated us from that
[1:11:05] because that's a spirit of the
[1:11:05] antichrist.
[1:11:08] Because you see it is like to say that
[1:11:09] God has an end.
[1:11:12] There is no end to God's revelation.
[1:11:16] But also be careful not to call a
[1:11:19] brother who doesn't see the way you see
[1:11:24] and you call him Nicolant
[1:11:29] or because they do things different.
[1:11:33] That's a wrong attitude.
[1:11:36] We see people like sister um Priscilla
[1:11:42] and brother Aquilla. They came and met a
[1:11:44] man who was a great preacher of the word
[1:11:48] for years but he had this less
[1:11:51] revelation
[1:11:54] but they did not begin to tell him
[1:11:56] brother I mean this guy I don't know
[1:11:58] what was his name somebody remember me
[1:12:00] remind me
[1:12:02] yes thank you to say brothers
[1:12:06] oh you are a nicolon
[1:12:08] because the way you are teaching you and
[1:12:11] you know he was a mighty man
[1:12:13] He had taught many. No doubt he had many
[1:12:16] following him.
[1:12:18] But they who had further revelation
[1:12:21] did not call him a nickel. Did not call
[1:12:24] him a false. Did not call him a false
[1:12:26] brother. And what did they do? The Bible
[1:12:29] says they took him and unto themselves
[1:12:34] with love and instructed him in further
[1:12:37] revelation of the word.
[1:12:42] Elect cannot persecute El.
[1:12:46] The moment you have a negative attitude
[1:12:49] about another brother,
[1:12:53] oh just know this spirit is now
[1:12:55] attacking.
[1:12:57] You should always love one another.
[1:13:00] Love the brothers going to other
[1:13:01] churches.
[1:13:03] Love the ones going to this church. Love
[1:13:06] the ones you disagree with.
[1:13:09] Let me tell you the test of true
[1:13:11] Christianity
[1:13:14] is if you can bitterly disagree with
[1:13:16] somebody,
[1:13:21] disagree with them.
[1:13:24] Yes.
[1:13:28] But you still love them.
[1:13:34] Someone told me, "I thought you disagree
[1:13:36] with that brother's idea.
[1:13:39] I saw you with him. I said yes. What is
[1:13:43] wrong? I thought in other words like it
[1:13:46] is confusing.
[1:13:49] You don't always walk or fellowship with
[1:13:52] the ones you agree with.
[1:13:56] You agree with as much as you can.
[1:14:01] I always say this, agree with none, but
[1:14:04] agree with the word.
[1:14:09] But even then it is the revelation that
[1:14:12] you have of the word.
[1:14:15] And our revelation is not always the
[1:14:17] same.
[1:14:19] Even here in this church right now,
[1:14:24] we pick one subject.
[1:14:26] We sit around the table. We begin to
[1:14:29] talk about it. We are going to disagree.
[1:14:34] Some others will disagree.
[1:14:38] No, no, no. Pastor, it is like this.
[1:14:41] I did not know that pastor you believe
[1:14:43] like that.
[1:14:46] You know, we will disagree and that's
[1:14:49] okay because our revelation is not the
[1:14:53] same.
[1:14:56] But maturity is to understand that
[1:15:01] and to know I can defer on something
[1:15:03] with my brother.
[1:15:08] They are my brother.
[1:15:10] I love them because we are going to
[1:15:13] heaven together.
[1:15:16] Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm not afraid of him and he's not
[1:15:21] afraid of me. I have a few more minutes.
[1:15:23] Let's continue here. When Balam asked
[1:15:25] God for permission to go,
[1:15:28] God turned him down.
[1:15:31] My that st but insisted
[1:15:35] promising him ever greater rewards than
[1:15:37] one.
[1:15:38] So Bam went to God. Now one answer from
[1:15:41] God should have been enough.
[1:15:45] But not for self-willed Balam.
[1:15:49] When God saw his perversity,
[1:15:52] he told him to get up and go.
[1:15:55] Quickly he sowed the donkey and away he
[1:15:56] went.
[1:15:58] He should have realized that this was
[1:15:59] his was simply God's permissive will.
[1:16:04] And he wouldn't be able to cast the them
[1:16:06] if he went and 20 times and tried 20
[1:16:09] times.
[1:16:12] And people are like that.
[1:16:15] I don't care what God thinks.
[1:16:18] Brother, always care about what God
[1:16:20] thinks.
[1:16:23] Do things according to the conviction
[1:16:25] you have
[1:16:29] and according to the revelation
[1:16:32] that is given to you
[1:16:34] no I must side with my pastor
[1:16:38] I must side with my brother with my
[1:16:39] sister with my mother that's no
[1:16:42] revelation
[1:16:44] that's canality always side with the
[1:16:47] word
[1:16:50] always side with inspiration that you
[1:16:52] have received from God.
[1:16:57] Not, oh, they're giving me money here.
[1:17:00] And I said, brother, what do you think?
[1:17:04] Your heart tells you something else,
[1:17:06] but your mind tells you another
[1:17:10] because of the money.
[1:17:14] Okay.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But and then they begin to
[1:17:20] stammer.
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:23] Because of the money that is balam the
[1:17:27] way of
[1:17:28] is very painful
[1:17:33] has been given something to do something
[1:17:36] wrong. Their mind tells them something.
[1:17:38] Their heart tells them something
[1:17:41] but their mind reminds them.
[1:17:44] You ate something.
[1:17:48] Speak according to what you ate.
[1:17:51] not according to what you believe.
[1:17:55] But God will respect you and honor you
[1:17:58] and bless you if you always do things
[1:18:00] according to your conviction,
[1:18:05] not what somebody else has done,
[1:18:08] promised you, I will make you big, I'll
[1:18:10] make you this, I'll make you that.
[1:18:13] That has helped me in my ministry.
[1:18:16] I don't care what anybody say.
[1:18:19] I do things by conviction
[1:18:22] and spiritual leadership.
[1:18:24] That's the only way to escape balam.
[1:18:29] I wish I had time to get into the the
[1:18:32] depth of it, but
[1:18:34] so let's just read a little more. I have
[1:18:36] about 10 minutes.
[1:18:39] Listen, it says um so see the doctrine
[1:18:41] of balam
[1:18:43] go ahead anyway. Do it your way. They
[1:18:45] say well God has blessed us. It must be
[1:18:47] all right.
[1:18:49] I know he has blessed you. I don't deny
[1:18:51] that. But it's the same organizational
[1:18:53] route that Balam took.
[1:18:58] Defiance to God's word
[1:19:02] for teaching. So Balam went wildly down
[1:19:06] the road until the angel of God stood in
[1:19:08] his way.
[1:19:13] But that prophet, that bishop,
[1:19:17] that chairman, that president, that
[1:19:19] general overseer
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; was so blinded to spiritual things
[1:19:28] by the thought of horn and glory
[1:19:32] and money
[1:19:34] that he could not see the angel standing
[1:19:36] with a sword.
[1:19:40] There is two to block the mad prophet.
[1:19:45] I tell you they say man speaks and it is
[1:19:47] true
[1:19:49] and you you are saying it doesn't
[1:19:50] because you have not got a temptation
[1:19:56] I wish I had time I would give you some
[1:19:57] stories
[1:20:00] one time maybe I'll give you this one a
[1:20:03] man wrote me and you know and he says we
[1:20:05] want to come and support your ministry
[1:20:06] and all that
[1:20:09] I was in Ethiopia that and says money is
[1:20:12] not our problem we have God has blessed
[1:20:14] us with a lot
[1:20:16] I was like wow I'm a believer. Are you a
[1:20:19] believer? Yes. We are preaching the
[1:20:21] message of
[1:20:22] but as my custom is
[1:20:26] I I I had to make a research and find
[1:20:29] out about the brothers. I asked the
[1:20:32] brothers that come from the area. He
[1:20:33] said he come.
[1:20:36] Yeah. It is true. He has the money.
[1:20:39] He owns gold mine.
[1:20:42] It is true. like little gold mines
[1:20:48] and and so it is true. I said it is also
[1:20:51] true.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; He's a polygamist
[1:20:55] and he he preaches polygamy.
[1:20:59] I said I'll ask him.
[1:21:02] So I asked him I said brother what is
[1:21:06] your say on polygamy?
[1:21:09] says brother on that issue
[1:21:12] God has God is here to reveal to us more
[1:21:16] we are still praying for more resolution
[1:21:20] what is your opinion
[1:21:23] and and then I I I sent him a text
[1:21:25] brother marriage and divorce
[1:21:29] where he said
[1:21:31] you know go tell your children let them
[1:21:34] tell their children never to do it again
[1:21:39] if you know what I'm talking about? Go
[1:21:40] and read it.
[1:21:42] So, so I I sent it to him. He never
[1:21:46] responded to me again.
[1:21:48] But that's how I lost a lot of millions.
[1:21:53] And And that's not the only time.
[1:21:56] As a minister, you are going to be
[1:21:57] tempted,
[1:21:59] especially younger minister.
[1:22:01] Money, glory, power,
[1:22:05] you get it. and then you'll be known and
[1:22:07] fame and things. But you see that's the
[1:22:10] spirit of
[1:22:13] but the spirit of Christ will not stand
[1:22:16] with the organization.
[1:22:19] The spirit of Christ will stand with the
[1:22:21] world.
[1:22:23] Loves the word love with Christ because
[1:22:26] this is all about him.
[1:22:29] It's not about us.
[1:22:32] It's all about him. Not about our
[1:22:34] organization.
[1:22:36] not about our accomplishments.
[1:22:38] It's all about him. And that's the
[1:22:41] narrow way.
[1:22:43] Well, then the devil begins to tell you
[1:22:46] if you'd have accepted that,
[1:22:49] you would have, you know, not been
[1:22:52] suffering here. Yeah, you can suffer.
[1:22:56] And let me tell you, God's way
[1:22:59] is not easy.
[1:23:01] It's a narrow way. It's painful.
[1:23:06] It's the narrow way.
[1:23:08] It's a narrow way.
[1:23:11] It's not easy.
[1:23:14] Praise God. I've I've just been looking
[1:23:17] and in closing in closing. I've just
[1:23:20] been looking
[1:23:21] and hearing a few people every now and
[1:23:23] then
[1:23:25] from the fellowship here saying well
[1:23:28] well uh I would rather go to another
[1:23:31] church
[1:23:33] where they don't ask for building fund
[1:23:36] because yeah they don't ask there they
[1:23:38] don't ask
[1:23:42] some of times not not even that way but
[1:23:44] because they don't ask
[1:23:48] but have you Ask yourself what is God's
[1:23:51] way
[1:23:54] of of a of a a local church
[1:23:58] getting their own building.
[1:24:01] What is God's way?
[1:24:03] God's way is what we are doing.
[1:24:08] That is God's way. The people, the local
[1:24:11] people,
[1:24:13] support the local work
[1:24:16] as they supporting it.
[1:24:18] with their substance, little mega as it
[1:24:22] may be,
[1:24:24] then God will bless and prosper them
[1:24:28] in return.
[1:24:30] That's God's way. It's a narrow way.
[1:24:32] It's not easy.
[1:24:34] Let me tell you, there is no pastor
[1:24:35] maybe in the Pentecostals. I don't even
[1:24:37] think in the Pentecost
[1:24:40] who loves standing before the people
[1:24:43] telling them, "Oh, you need to give, you
[1:24:44] have this name, you need to give that
[1:24:48] Everyone wants to just come and preach
[1:24:49] about heaven
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:53] and especially in the message you want
[1:24:54] to do that only
[1:24:56] don't talk about money
[1:24:59] but I don't talk about money
[1:25:02] I will not talk about money and then I
[1:25:04] will go to brother Steven
[1:25:07] and beg him
[1:25:09] to provide for you a building.
[1:25:14] Is that the way of God?
[1:25:18] The way of God is narrow, I'm using that
[1:25:23] to give you an example.
[1:25:25] The way of God is narrow.
[1:25:29] But it must be walked into
[1:25:32] by revelation.
[1:25:34] Hallelujah. And when you walk and do
[1:25:36] something by revelation,
[1:25:39] if you are sacrificed by revelation,
[1:25:42] if if you you know you do something by
[1:25:44] revelation, you worship by revelation.
[1:25:47] Whatever you do by revelation,
[1:25:50] then God stands behind.
[1:25:53] He's pleased
[1:25:55] and he blesses.
[1:25:57] For it is impossible for him to be
[1:26:00] pleased without revelation. But when he
[1:26:03] sees revelation,
[1:26:05] It is impossible for him not to be
[1:26:07] peace.
[1:26:09] And as you stand on your feet, here
[1:26:12] comes Abraham. And Abraham by
[1:26:14] revelation, he went to sacrifice a boy.
[1:26:18] And and you know the boy asked him, "Oh,
[1:26:21] we have firewood. We have where's the
[1:26:23] sacrifice?"
[1:26:25] By faith. He said, "God shall provide
[1:26:27] for him
[1:26:29] a sacrifice." That was revelation. That
[1:26:32] was faith.
[1:26:34] Amen. As the musicians can come and at
[1:26:36] that moment,
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; you know what? He created the sacrifice.
[1:26:43] Hallelujah.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Who created the sacrifice?
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Abraham did by faith. He said, "God
[1:26:50] shall do it." And but you see, he was
[1:26:54] doing what he was doing by faith, by
[1:26:56] revelation. I said, "I'm going to kill
[1:26:58] this boy." It was a hard thing for him.
[1:27:02] It was a narrow way,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; but right there, God blessed him. He
[1:27:09] said, "Abraham, you can't do that. Look
[1:27:12] on the side. He has a sacrifice. Do not
[1:27:16] kill your son,
[1:27:18] brother, sister.
[1:27:20] That's what we need to overcome.
[1:27:26] As I'm continuing with this subject,
[1:27:30] I'll get to the place where brother Bam
[1:27:32] was spoken to by the angel of the Lord
[1:27:34] by the Lord.
[1:27:37] And I told him because you've chosen an
[1:27:39] arrow path.
[1:27:41] They had a way.
[1:27:44] It's a correct decision.
[1:27:47] It is my way.
[1:27:50] What a glorious decision.
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:54] You see friends,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; it's a glorious decision
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; to not always go through the popular way
[1:28:01] but the narrow way.
[1:28:07] May God help us.
[1:28:10] All my life
[1:28:12] with truth every way.
[1:28:19] I need a change
[1:28:22] to walk in your way.
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:29] Give me truth,
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:32] mercy,
[1:28:34] and grace.
[1:28:37] Lord, the narrow way
[1:28:41] to walk every day.
[1:28:48] Give me truth,
[1:28:52] mercy,
[1:28:54] and love.
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:00] Give me truth,
[1:29:04] mercy,
[1:29:06] and love
[1:29:09] [Music]
[1:29:12] so that I
[1:29:15] may dwell
[1:29:18] in your presence.
[1:29:23] Give me truth,
[1:29:28] mercy
[1:29:31] and love. Let me sing the first time one
[1:29:34] more time. Will hold my life
[1:29:39] with truth every
[1:29:43] way.
[1:29:45] Is it your prayer now? Oh, I need a
[1:29:49] change
[1:29:51] to walk in your way.
[1:30:00] Give me truth.
[1:30:03] Hallelujah. Mercy
[1:30:06] and grace,
[1:30:10] Lord.
[1:30:12] the narrow way
[1:30:15] to walk every
[1:30:19] day. We sing the chorus one more time.
[1:30:21] Give me truth. Oh, give me truth.
[1:30:28] Oh, mercy
[1:30:31] and love.
[1:30:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:37] Give me truth.
[1:30:40] Hallelujah.
[1:30:41] Oh mercy
[1:30:44] and life
[1:30:50] so that I
[1:30:54] may dwell
[1:30:56] in your praise.
[1:31:03] Give me truth. Hallelujah. Lord mercy.
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:14] Let us pray. Father in the name of
[1:31:16] Jesus, I want to come before you Lord
[1:31:19] tonight
[1:31:20] to thank you for the grace that you have
[1:31:23] given to us to walk in this narrow way.
[1:31:27] We know we cannot do it on our own
[1:31:30] but help us Jesus to walk in this narrow
[1:31:33] way. Give us grace. Give us truth. Give
[1:31:36] us mercy. Give us love
[1:31:39] to walk in this way and help us to love
[1:31:42] one another
[1:31:44] to know Lord is not an easy road
[1:31:48] but this is the way the narrow way
[1:31:52] that we must walk
[1:31:55] as we overcome every day Lord in our
[1:31:58] lives. We must walk your way the way of
[1:32:02] your word. Bless my brothers and
[1:32:04] sisters.

[1:32:17] every giver. Father,
