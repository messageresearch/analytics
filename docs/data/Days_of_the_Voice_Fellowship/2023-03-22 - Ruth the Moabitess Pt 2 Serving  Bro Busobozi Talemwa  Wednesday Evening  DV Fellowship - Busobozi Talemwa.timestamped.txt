[15:59] amen praise the Lord are you happy to be
[16:02] in the house of the Lord
[16:03] amen take your Bibles to the Book of
[16:05] Ruth chapter we will first
[16:07] uh read the last portion which we which
[16:11] we left out in chapter one on Sunday
[16:14] uh we read chapter 1 verse 19 and then
[16:17] we will read the
[16:18] we'll go on to chapter two
[16:27] praise the Lord
[16:30] uh chapter 1 verse 19 says so are we all
[16:35] there if you're there Say Amen
[16:52] Okay so
[16:55] The Book of Ruth is after judges and
[16:57] before first Samuel
[17:07] so I'd like us to first read that
[17:09] portion which we left out
[17:16] from verses 19.
[17:19] so so so they too went until they came
[17:23] to Bethlehem and it came to pass when
[17:25] they were calm to Bethlehem that all the
[17:28] city was moved uh was moved up about
[17:32] them and they said is this Naomi and she
[17:36] said unto them call me not Naomi call me
[17:38] Mara for the almighty has dealt very
[17:40] bitterly with me I went out full and the
[17:44] Lord has brought me home again empty why
[17:47] then call ye me Naomi saying that the
[17:49] Lord has testified against me and the
[17:52] almighty has Afflicted me
[17:59] with her which returned out of the
[18:02] country of Moab and they came to
[18:04] Bethlehem in the beginning of Bali
[18:06] Harvest so I'd like us now to go on on
[18:09] to chapter two
[18:12] so the person we have now read is a
[18:16] after
[18:17] we have seen a decision of Ruth after
[18:20] Ruth made a decision
[18:22] then now what came next was them to
[18:25] start to take the journey
[18:27] to to the land of Israel or to Bethlehem
[18:31] so when they arrived in Bethlehem
[18:34] then now Naomi did not want to be called
[18:37] Naomi anymore because according to how
[18:39] God had Justified against her and so she
[18:42] said call me Mara
[18:44] for the Lord has testified against me
[18:46] now I would like us to uh introduce
[18:49] something else today in chapter 2.
[18:54] let us read beginning with verse 1. and
[18:57] Naomi had had the king's man of her
[18:59] husband a mighty man of wealth of the
[19:02] family of elimelech and his name was
[19:04] Boaz
[19:05] and Ruth the moabites said unto Naomi
[19:08] Let Me Now go to the field and glean
[19:11] ears of corn after him in whose sight I
[19:14] shall find Grace and she said that to
[19:17] her go my daughter
[19:19] and she went you see I love one thing I
[19:21] love about Ruth is that Ruth was a woman
[19:25] of Revelation Ruth many things were
[19:28] being revealed to her even before Naomi
[19:30] really told her and uh and uh
[19:34] we know that brother Burnham types Naomi
[19:36] as the Old Testament or as the old
[19:39] Orthodox Jewish church and and Ruth as
[19:43] the New Testament the bride and and see
[19:46] so the bride there is something not
[19:48] about the bride of Christ that she has
[19:49] Revelation can we say Amen to that
[19:53] and so I'd like us to look at verse 3
[19:55] and she went and came and came and
[19:58] gleaned in the field after the Reapers
[20:00] and her harp was to to was too light to
[20:04] light on a part of the field belonging
[20:05] unto Boaz who was on the Kindred of
[20:08] early marriage and behold Boaz came from
[20:11] Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the
[20:14] Lord be with you and they answered him
[20:15] the Lord blessed thee then said Boaz
[20:18] unto his servant that was set over the
[20:21] Reapers whose damso is this and the
[20:24] servant that was set over his Reapers
[20:26] answered and said it is the more
[20:28] brightest damso that came back with
[20:30] Naomi out of the country of Moab and she
[20:33] said I pray you let me green and gather
[20:35] after the Reapers among the shields so
[20:38] she came and has continued even from the
[20:40] morning until now that the that she
[20:43] tarried a little in the house can the
[20:45] deacons please help
[20:47] verse 8 then said Boaz unto Ruth here is
[20:51] thou not my daughter go not to glean in
[20:54] another field neither go from hands but
[20:58] abide here fast by my maidens let thine
[21:02] eyes be on the field that they do reap
[21:04] and go Thou after them have I not
[21:07] charged the young man
[21:11] have I not charged the young man that
[21:14] they shall not touch thee and when thou
[21:17] art a thirst go unto the vessels and
[21:21] drink of that which the young men have
[21:23] drawn then she fell on her face and
[21:27] bowed herself to the ground and said
[21:29] unto him why have I found Grace in thine
[21:32] eyes
[21:34] but thou should stick thou knowledge of
[21:37] me seeing I am a stranger and Boaz
[21:40] answered and said unto her it has
[21:44] fully been showed me all that thou has
[21:47] done unto thy mother-in-law since the
[21:49] death of thine husband and how thou Hast
[21:52] left thy father and thy mother and they
[21:54] land of thy Nativity
[21:57] and had come unto a people which thou
[22:00] knowest not here here to fall
[22:04] the Lord recompersed thy Work and a full
[22:06] reward be given thee for the Lord God of
[22:09] Israel
[22:11] and under whose wings Thou Art come to
[22:15] trust
[22:17] did you look at that verse 12
[22:19] when you give up everything for the sake
[22:21] of the Lord he recompenses you and he
[22:24] rewards you those are two different
[22:26] things
[22:27] he recompenses all your time all that
[22:31] you lost he decompenses
[22:33] for all that you did
[22:35] for all that you sacrificed for all that
[22:37] you lost he recompenses you and then he
[22:40] rewards you
[22:42] and see so when Boaz came he was very
[22:46] he was he was he was not in the dark
[22:50] about what this woman Ruth had
[22:54] sacrificed
[22:56] knew everything about Ruth and so he now
[23:00] began to tell her because of what you
[23:01] have done may the Lord recompense you
[23:04] for a full reward
[23:05] okay let us go on we shall read up to
[23:08] verse 18.
[23:12] verse 13 now then she said let me find
[23:15] favor in thy sight my lord for that thou
[23:19] has comforted me and for that thou has
[23:21] spoken friendly unto thine handmaid
[23:23] though I be not like unto one of thine
[23:26] handmaidens and by what say down to her
[23:29] at Meal Time Come Thou hither and eat of
[23:33] the bread and deep thy muscle in the
[23:36] vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers
[23:39] and he reap he reached her parched corn
[23:43] and she did eat and was surfaced and
[23:46] left
[23:47] and when she was reason up to Green but
[23:51] was commanded his younger men saying let
[23:54] her glean even among their sheaves and
[23:57] reproach her not now remember this is an
[24:00] outsider she's not even a Jew she's not
[24:02] even an Israelite she's from outside and
[24:05] now she has come to glean among among
[24:07] the Jews but you see the eye of bawas
[24:11] quota quickly and they began to make
[24:13] friends and he even invited her to come
[24:16] on his table and eat together can you
[24:18] imagine that fast
[24:20] if you have found favor before God I'm
[24:22] saying if you have had the message and
[24:25] you have believed the message then you
[24:26] found favor before God and God has
[24:29] brought you to come and be right there
[24:31] Amen on the table on the high table and
[24:34] sup together with him
[24:36] it's a blessing
[24:37] verse 15 and when she was risen up to
[24:40] Green Boaz commanded his younger men
[24:44] saying let her green even among the
[24:46] sheaves and reproach her not and let let
[24:50] fall also
[24:52] some of the handfuls of of purpose for
[24:56] her and leave them that she may glean
[24:58] them and rebuke her not so she gleaned
[25:02] in the field until evening and and beat
[25:05] out that
[25:07] she had gleaned and it was about an F an
[25:11] effer of Bali and she took it up and
[25:15] went into the City and her mother-in-law
[25:17] saw that what she had gleaned and she
[25:20] brought forth and gave to her that she
[25:22] had reserved after she was sufficed
[25:27] let us speak to the Lord a moment father
[25:30] we have just read a portion of This Book
[25:32] of Ruth once again this is your holy
[25:34] inspired word it was written for our
[25:36] example and now Lord I pray that you
[25:39] will come and give us the same
[25:41] inspiration Lord today that your people
[25:44] may be blessed there are not many books
[25:46] in the Bible that are titled by the name
[25:48] of a woman just a few and Ruth happens
[25:51] to be one of them Lord I know that this
[25:54] book of Ruth speaks of you of the Bride
[25:56] of Jesus Christ in this time so while we
[25:59] go through this book and study a few
[26:01] things here and there and go through it
[26:02] Lord father no doubt will not be able to
[26:05] cover everything but whatever the holy
[26:08] spirit will lead us to touch on and may
[26:11] it be a blessing to your people father
[26:12] is my prayer in Jesus name
[26:15] amen amen you may have your seats
[26:22] I was just thinking about that song Let
[26:24] us sing that chorus as we we get into
[26:27] the word that God
[26:29] should love
[26:31] I say
[26:36] should love to
[26:41] sorrow into please
[26:46] [Music]
[27:01] let us sing it again the first one
[27:04] stanza that God
[27:08] foreign
[27:09] [Music]
[27:17] to change
[27:20] my sorrow into Bliss Norris
[27:26] [Music]
[27:27] ready
[27:30] I plan to bring me now how wonderful
[27:37] his life
[27:44] [Music]
[27:52] sing it outside
[27:56] oh yeah
[27:58] [Music]
[28:11] such as
[28:13] [Music]
[28:28] freely in the skin
[28:32] [Music]
[28:33] although
[28:35] it
[28:37] meant his death on Calvary
[28:42] what it is
[28:50] [Music]
[29:04] Hallelujah
[29:08] sing it outside
[29:17] [Music]
[29:25] [Music]
[29:29] I wonder
[29:31] is love
[29:33] like peaceful
[29:40] how we
[29:43] out cause such as
[29:47] [Music]
[29:50] blind
[29:52] the Savior played under
[29:56] diary
[29:58] Redemption 4.
[30:01] our worthless
[30:04] oh yes
[30:20] think about his love for you brother
[30:23] sister oh yes
[30:43] the
[30:44] wonderful is love
[30:48] amen and now he takes you
[30:52] and now he takes me to his heart of sun
[31:00] oh he asks me not well to take a
[31:08] servants please
[31:10] will the
[31:12] fire of
[31:14] country
[31:16] wanderings all the time amen wide open
[31:21] eyes
[31:34] oh yes Lord thank you for your love Lord
[31:37] Jesus thank you for loving us Lord oh
[31:41] yes Lord Jesus Oh Hallelujah
[31:46] my God
[31:55] how wonderful is Love
[31:59] Like Me
[32:04] are you not thankful of his love
[32:08] amen amen
[32:12] God bless you now I was thinking about
[32:14] Ruth the more by it is Ruth the more
[32:16] bites was a woman that truly can sing
[32:19] the song that we have sung because Ruth
[32:22] the moabites was not a Jew and therefore
[32:25] she was not in the original plan and and
[32:27] the way that God had planned these
[32:28] things out but Ruth because of God is
[32:31] Grace Ruth was loved and Ruth was highly
[32:34] favored and Ruth was chosen and Ruth but
[32:37] did you know even if Ruth was chosen
[32:39] Ruth was loved Ruth was favored Ruth was
[32:41] predestinated but it had to take Ruth to
[32:44] make a decision
[32:46] just like us today it has to make to
[32:49] take us to make a decision tell your
[32:51] neighbor you have to take and make a
[32:53] decision tell them you have to make a
[32:55] decision
[32:56] amen
[32:57] praise the name of the Lord why don't
[32:59] your brothers come this side so I look
[33:01] One Direction now friends so today I'd
[33:04] like to talk the second part of this and
[33:06] I'd like to call it Ruth the more about
[33:09] his serving or Ruth serving
[33:18] now I'll begin with that quote from the
[33:21] kinsman redeemer whereby the Barnum said
[33:23] I read it on Sunday I'll read it one
[33:24] more time he said I want to approach it
[33:26] from four different phases Ruth I got it
[33:28] right here Ruth deciding Ruth making a
[33:31] decision Ruth serving Ruth resting and
[33:33] Ruth rewarded as we come back Ruth
[33:35] making the decision Ruth after she made
[33:37] our decision Ruth then Ruth serving then
[33:40] Ruth is resting then Ruth is rewarded
[33:42] let me tell you whether whether you feel
[33:45] it or not you like it or not all of us
[33:47] are going through these four stages
[33:49] everyone that is called of God must go
[33:52] through these four stages I must go
[33:55] through them you must go through them
[33:57] because Ruth is a type of the Gentile
[33:59] bride the gentle church and Ruth goes
[34:03] through four stages when she was called
[34:04] by God and the very first stage is what
[34:07] we covered on Sunday about Ruth making
[34:10] at this her decision and so today I'd
[34:13] like us to cover the second Ruth serving
[34:17] now there is uh here's something and and
[34:20] as I promised you through this subject
[34:22] I'll do a lot of quotes and I would like
[34:24] you to follow me brother if there is a
[34:26] brother if you can put them on the
[34:28] screen and that would be not nice
[34:31] that's what Ruth had to do she had to
[34:33] make sure to come from her own
[34:36] over to another people I was supposed to
[34:39] read this on Sunday but I did not she
[34:40] was converted she made a decision Ruth
[34:44] was converted she made a decision
[34:46] everyone that comes to the Lord must be
[34:49] converted and must make a decision let
[34:52] me ask you a question why do we need to
[34:53] be converted to begin with if we were
[34:56] born perfect we don't need to be
[34:57] converted if we if you were born in a
[35:00] perfect way and that that you know
[35:02] there's some people who say I don't need
[35:03] to repent I don't need to be saved
[35:05] because I have nothing to be saved from
[35:07] they think that someone who repents is
[35:09] someone who has murdered some people
[35:11] they think that someone who repents is
[35:13] or needs someone that needs conversion
[35:15] is a person who smokes who does bad
[35:18] things out there or or who does adultery
[35:21] or fornication but like that younger
[35:22] Rich ruler that younger boy by the way
[35:24] was was as perfect as perfect as we can
[35:27] feel or we can as perfect can be because
[35:30] if you want to look at Perfection
[35:31] brother and you ask me what is the
[35:34] definition of perfection most of us
[35:36] think that a definition of perfection is
[35:38] when someone has never done anything bad
[35:41] right
[35:43] you have never sinned according to us
[35:45] sin is the wrong actions that we do
[35:48] therefore if someone lies tells lies if
[35:51] if I ask you who has never told a lie
[35:53] you lift up your hand who was never
[35:55] stolen something you lift up your hand
[35:57] who has never you know committed
[35:59] fornication lift up your hand who has
[36:00] never done this and that you lift up
[36:02] your hand then it means all of you who
[36:04] have lifted up your hands according to
[36:06] what we think is perfection you are
[36:08] perfect
[36:09] but according to God the definition of
[36:11] perfection is not that
[36:12] we are not perfect because we have not
[36:14] done wrong actions we are perfect
[36:18] because we have accepted the the
[36:21] sacrifice which was given on the cross
[36:23] for us we are perfect because we have
[36:26] accepted amen we have made a decision to
[36:29] be converted because we are born in a
[36:32] perverted way therefore we need to be
[36:34] converted to the perfect way are you
[36:37] following me
[36:38] all of us who were born in sin we were
[36:41] born in sin and because of the listen
[36:44] listen because of the way we were born
[36:47] that's the reason why we need to be
[36:49] converted not because of the things we
[36:51] did when we got born
[36:54] no but we we need to be converted
[36:57] because we were born did you hear that
[37:00] brother Joseph did you hear that you
[37:02] need to be converted because you were
[37:04] born can you imagine some people said oh
[37:06] God is not fair how come that because I
[37:08] was born I need to be converted because
[37:10] you were born in a perverted way and you
[37:13] that we were born in a way of sin we
[37:16] were born in a way of the according to
[37:19] the lust of the Flesh and therefore we
[37:21] need to be born again according not to
[37:23] the lust of the flesh but according to
[37:25] the word of God it's the word of God
[37:27] that makes you and me perfect and when
[37:31] he says that we should be perfect even
[37:32] as god is perfect it means we should be
[37:34] converted into the nature of Jesus
[37:36] Christ and so here Ruth made a decision
[37:39] and I wanted to bring your thoughts
[37:40] together and really follow me tonight
[37:42] and I think it will be better without an
[37:44] interpreter today so that I can cover
[37:46] everything I needed to cover because
[37:48] when we have an interpretation we take
[37:49] longer so if you listen to me and and
[37:52] then we will be able to go faster
[37:54] so listen here it says and you make a
[37:56] decision
[37:57] you got to you God to take your choice
[38:00] you want to go back to the things of the
[38:02] world or you want to go on with God you
[38:04] see it's a decision that we make do you
[38:07] want to go back to the things of the
[38:09] world or you want to go on with God I
[38:12] ask you also today do you want to go on
[38:15] with God or you want to take on to go
[38:17] back to the things of the world what do
[38:18] you want to do say what you want to do
[38:21] you see I want to go on with God and you
[38:24] know when we when we hear oh I want to
[38:26] go on with God many times we think oh
[38:28] going on with God is easy he's better no
[38:31] going on with God we are going to see
[38:33] tonight is the harder way it's not the
[38:36] easy way out it's the other way out
[38:39] but it is a decision that every believer
[38:41] must make in order to please God and go
[38:45] into the Rapture so here he says do you
[38:48] want to act like the world and the rest
[38:49] of them then kiss Christ and say goodbye
[38:52] and go back
[38:54] but if you want to take you away with
[38:57] the Lord is despised the few
[38:59] hold on to God his unchanging hand
[39:03] amen regardless of what the rest of the
[39:06] world says you hold right there God said
[39:09] so it is true I believe it do I have
[39:12] anybody that believes it here today
[39:13] though I can't make it manifest in my
[39:16] life God said so I believe it oh I hold
[39:21] right here and by the way this is the
[39:25] attitude of every believer even when I
[39:29] cannot make some things manifest in my
[39:31] life even when certain things are still
[39:34] very hard for me to achieve and to
[39:35] attain spiritually speaking but I will
[39:38] hold right here I will not give up I
[39:41] will not go back to the world I will not
[39:43] give up I will stay right here in the
[39:46] world because I've made up my mind I've
[39:49] met my choice I'm going to stand right
[39:51] here in the world
[39:53] amen praise the name of the Lord
[39:56] and here
[39:59] some of you promised me that you'll
[40:01] listen to the message the king's man
[40:02] Redeemer how many listen to it
[40:05] raise up your hand still okay two all
[40:09] right those of you who did not listen to
[40:10] it you did not keep your promise so
[40:13] please go back and listen to it tonight
[40:15] because again I'll ask you when I come
[40:16] back to minister so please go and listen
[40:19] to that message I know we might have
[40:20] been busy but create some time for the
[40:23] Lord
[40:24] because if you listen to it and we go
[40:26] through it oh man you just enjoy it so
[40:28] very much so I want you to hear this
[40:30] quote again it says you see I want us to
[40:32] look a little bit on the Journey of Ruth
[40:33] he says she said I will go
[40:36] clean cut decision I will go clean cut
[40:40] okay
[40:42] see this sure would you go I'm not sure
[40:45] let me tell you God does not like
[40:47] mediocre's
[40:49] God likes you see by the band I'm told
[40:51] his son Billy Paul he said if you're
[40:54] going to be anything be the best
[40:56] if you're going to be a bum be the best
[40:58] bum in the world
[41:00] you see if you're going to be a gangster
[41:01] be the best gangster if you're going to
[41:04] be a Christian be the best Christian
[41:06] if you can't if you if you be a
[41:08] Christian and you're not the best
[41:10] Christian you are only robbing your time
[41:11] not God this time you're robbing your
[41:13] time so but if you are going to be a
[41:15] Christian be the best Christian don't be
[41:17] in the middle don't be cold or don't be
[41:19] lukewarm cold not cold not hot
[41:23] but God is looking for people who are
[41:25] hot who are on fire for him who are who
[41:28] are living everything else and making
[41:30] like he said here a clean cut decision
[41:34] quickly mad she could have to eat that's
[41:37] what Ruth did and Alpa went back
[41:41] let me tell you in this journey that we
[41:43] are taking this journey of salvation
[41:46] and like I said it's not an easy Journey
[41:47] even since I started this journey many
[41:50] years ago
[41:52] there have been many we started with and
[41:54] many left it because it was not easy for
[41:58] them they made up their decision to turn
[42:00] back but we kept marching forward
[42:03] is that right brother martin
[42:05] we kept has it been easy for us no has
[42:08] it been a Bed of Roses no how many when
[42:11] you believed how many believed with you
[42:13] and and and and are still with you many
[42:15] of them turned back
[42:17] many of them turned back so it's not for
[42:21] the faint-hearted it's not for the weak
[42:23] and the lazy it is for those that are
[42:25] going to make a clean cut decision when
[42:28] you make a clinical decision and You
[42:30] Begin this journey my friend you have
[42:32] begun a war it's not just a journey it
[42:34] is a war him and this journey of
[42:36] following Jesus Christ and believing the
[42:38] word is not easy it is hard because you
[42:41] are making a bunch of sacrifices you are
[42:44] making many sacrifices that are not
[42:45] going to make you popular you are making
[42:47] sacrifices that are going to make you
[42:49] look as if you were an oddball the amen
[42:51] before even others but when you make
[42:53] that decision you make a clean cut quick
[42:57] decision say I'm not going to go back
[43:00] and he says the journeyed on Ruth in our
[43:04] heart not knowing where she was going
[43:05] can you imagine
[43:07] how many of you know heaven or have you
[43:10] ever we don't know where we are going we
[43:13] don't know heaven we have never been
[43:14] there before but in our soul something
[43:16] tells us amen that that land is good
[43:18] that land is Flowing with milk and honey
[43:20] and we we have never seen it without
[43:22] physical eyes but yet we believe that
[43:25] land is there amen and I know one day
[43:28] I'm going to get into that land
[43:30] Hallelujah and I know that one day these
[43:33] things of the world is going to seem
[43:34] like nothing the suffering of the world
[43:36] is going to seem like nothing the needs
[43:39] and the ones and the things that have
[43:40] been putting me here and there amen one
[43:43] day I will wake up one morning and I
[43:45] will no longer be in this body because
[43:46] all these things will be nothing when I
[43:49] have finally overcome amen and Ruth was
[43:52] going to a land I'm imagining she might
[43:55] have sang that song that song There is a
[43:58] land that is fairer than day and by
[44:02] faith we can see the fire
[44:25] grow up she had never gone beyond the
[44:27] board of Moab but here she was amen
[44:30] telling uh telling Naomi I am leaving
[44:33] all my people I am leaving all my land
[44:37] I'm leaving behind my culture I'm
[44:40] leaving behind my tribe I'm leaving
[44:42] behind my friends I'm leaving behind
[44:44] everything I ever knew to the land I
[44:47] have never been to
[44:49] it is the same thing that we believe I
[44:51] should do hallelujah amen brother Dixon
[44:54] before God is looking for a people that
[44:57] are going to keep marching forward are
[44:59] people that do not look back friends let
[45:01] us not look back we have gone through
[45:04] why would you look back now you see Ruth
[45:08] he says the prophet says she they
[45:11] journeyed on and Ruth in her heart not
[45:13] knowing where she was going but a type
[45:15] of the church we saw John like Abraham
[45:18] we are pilgrims in a Strange Land Among
[45:21] Us strange people
[45:22] and on she went and finally she came
[45:25] into the room that had the place where
[45:27] Naomi was bringing her and what did she
[45:30] find everybody parting her on the back
[45:33] and saying Ruth we are glad to have you
[45:35] down here was that the case
[45:38] was that the case I'm asking you
[45:41] Hallelujah
[45:43] that everybody came and when Ruth
[45:45] arrived with the when when Ruth arrived
[45:48] with the what was her name
[45:51] with Naomi and then when they reached
[45:53] what's the name of the place
[45:58] when they reached this place don't think
[46:00] that everybody was parting her on their
[46:02] back and said oh Ruth
[46:05] Naomi oh we are happy to have you here
[46:07] please come and have a cup of tea you
[46:10] think this is how it was
[46:13] you think that's how it was
[46:15] that because she was from there and now
[46:17] when she came back to the land of bed
[46:20] today to to Bethlehem everybody was
[46:22] patting her on the back and welcoming
[46:23] and oh kissing I said oh oh now Ruth
[46:26] you're welcome to Bethlehem you wanted
[46:28] to be like that but that's not how it
[46:30] was
[46:32] yeah it's the prophet saying that by the
[46:34] way it's not me
[46:36] listen to what he says
[46:38] what
[50:47] Mecca immediately a great woman no the
[50:51] first thing Ruth made was to decide to
[50:54] make a right decision then the second
[50:56] thing that Ruth did amen was to serve
[51:00] don't expect to be a king without
[51:02] serving for you to be a king you have to
[51:05] first serve
[51:07] God help us
[51:09] and here the Christian Life he says
[51:12] those preachers they tell you that the
[51:14] Christian Life is a flower a bed of ease
[51:17] whoever says that he says he's either
[51:18] deceiving you oh he has never accepted
[51:21] that experience himself
[51:23] the world hurts you and the people will
[51:26] help will help will help you you've got
[51:28] to take the way of the Lord is despite
[51:30] the few and you have to be laughed at
[51:33] amen does somebody believe this you
[51:35] ought to be made fun of or anything else
[51:38] you have got to be different
[51:41] you are born of another Nation
[51:43] we are Christians from above and here
[51:45] brother now gives a story of him and his
[51:49] wife and how they were talking and he
[51:51] says my wife and I uh are quoted against
[51:54] it seems it seems so well to do it my
[51:57] wife asked me he said
[51:58] why don't the Christian women wear those
[52:02] clothes like the other women do meaning
[52:05] short skirts mini skirts trousers
[52:09] and things like that
[52:11] conditions
[52:14] people not from Uganda they can't they
[52:16] will not understand what I mean by kundi
[52:17] shows but here we know conditions Barca
[52:20] shows and stuff like that you see why
[52:22] don't the Christian women wear those
[52:24] things clothes like the other women and
[52:27] then I said we are all I'm
[52:30] um she said we are all Americans aren't
[52:32] we and brother Barnum said no sir
[52:36] and then
[52:37] she said well what are we but abandon
[52:40] said we are neither Germans we are not
[52:42] French we are not belgiums we are not
[52:45] Swiss we are not African we are not
[52:47] Americans or none of them and then she
[52:50] said but what are we and I said we are
[52:53] Christians
[52:54] Americans act like Americans German acts
[52:58] like a German because it's their
[53:00] National Spirit Are You Gonna Act Like A
[53:01] Uganda because it's hard National Spirit
[53:03] but we have a national Spirit also as
[53:06] Christians and that is the holy spirit
[53:09] coming from God out of heaven and you
[53:13] act like that
[53:16] it makes you conduct yourself as you
[53:18] they do up there because you are one you
[53:21] are of another world
[53:23] that's why even these things of of
[53:25] jesting you know what Justin is
[53:28] Justine
[53:32] you know those things they do it in the
[53:35] world it is common it's normal it is the
[53:38] way you enjoy life you know with your
[53:39] friends you know you you just gist and
[53:42] you joke around and you laugh you you
[53:45] throw another joke you laugh about it
[53:46] did you know that that's the spirit of
[53:48] this world did you not Believers should
[53:51] not do that
[53:52] did you know that the Bible says that a
[53:54] Believer is going to give an account of
[53:56] every what they speak did you know that
[53:58] so you see because we are of another
[54:00] world we should catch another Spirit
[54:02] from the world where we are going amen
[54:05] and the spirit from where the world the
[54:07] spirit of the of the world where we are
[54:09] going is the Holy Spirit and that's what
[54:11] I believe I should cash a Believer must
[54:13] catch him in that Holy Ghost that's why
[54:15] we are preaching the Holy Spirit evident
[54:17] service friends if you don't receive the
[54:20] Holy Spirit you have lost it all you
[54:22] have lost it all you may know the whole
[54:24] Bible in your head it might be packed
[54:26] there but until you receive that power
[54:28] the power of God the power of the Holy
[54:30] Ghost that shakes you up and changes you
[54:33] and converts you then you have not
[54:34] reached at all
[54:35] you have to receive that then it will
[54:37] change your mind and then you will be a
[54:39] complete completely different man
[54:41] here he says we are living in America
[54:44] that's true that's the body part but the
[54:47] soul that's called that conducts us our
[54:49] character is from above
[54:52] we live from above because we are born
[54:54] from above all Christians come from
[54:56] above are you hearing this do you
[54:57] believe it amen as I'm reading it you
[54:59] might as well say Amen Jesus said I am
[55:01] not from below I am from above if I was
[55:04] from below my subjects would fight for
[55:06] me but my kingdom is of above so is
[55:09] every man that's born of the kingdom of
[55:11] God he is from above hey man can you
[55:15] shout and say I am from above
[55:18] Hallelujah
[55:20] now when we were born
[55:23] we were born
[55:25] with many things around us that we need
[55:28] to change
[55:30] we may not have the power to change it
[55:31] but we need to yield ourselves to be
[55:34] adjusted as I'm going to show you here
[55:36] Ruth how to adjust herself
[55:39] you see the prophet says now watching
[55:42] now as we go on we find them coming into
[55:44] the into disappointment is that where
[55:47] you come into when you got the Holy
[55:49] Spirit sure did I did making fun of and
[55:53] everything
[55:54] that then notice life was hard for her
[55:57] and it's hard after you become a
[56:00] Christian even I want to say when
[56:02] someone you know is drunk of the Holy
[56:04] Spirit maybe we are in a service like
[56:05] this and someone and then maybe we are
[56:07] worshiping or singing you know and
[56:10] someone is drunk of the Holy Ghost maybe
[56:11] they're staggering around or falling
[56:13] around or shouting and then you begin to
[56:15] see people turning their necks and then
[56:18] in Surprise and in shock they look at
[56:19] that person that's a very clear sign
[56:21] that that person has not received that
[56:23] experience because if they had that
[56:25] experience they would be acting the same
[56:27] way that person is acting
[56:29] am I preaching to Believers today
[56:32] but he said when you receive the Holy
[56:34] Spirit
[56:35] you will be made fun of
[56:37] when you receive the Holy Spirit you'll
[56:39] be made fan of and everything and then
[56:41] he says notice life was hard for her
[56:43] meaning Ruth and it is hard after you
[56:46] become a Christian when you become a
[56:47] Christian let me say this when you
[56:49] become a Believer life becomes hard for
[56:52] you when you become a Believer it
[56:54] doesn't become easy it becomes hard when
[56:56] you receive the Holy Ghost life becomes
[56:58] hard it doesn't become easy it becomes
[57:01] harder because you got to adjust
[57:04] yourself from one life
[57:08] of gaiety and pleasures of the world to
[57:12] another life of consecration to God have
[57:15] you heard that you see you have got to
[57:18] adjust yourself
[57:20] from a life of gayity
[57:23] you know get here means you know you
[57:27] know fun a life of fun you know a Mary
[57:31] Being Mary or being cheerful you know
[57:34] the people of the world that's all they
[57:37] want to have deity you know cheerfulness
[57:40] they want to be cheerful that they want
[57:42] to be and you know for them they don't
[57:44] have the joy listen listen to me Church
[57:45] listen to me they don't have the joy of
[57:48] the Lord so you know the joy of the Lord
[57:51] comes from the inside of your heart
[57:52] sometimes when you are singing you even
[57:55] feel like shouting and laughing how many
[57:57] have you ever felt that you see when
[57:59] when the word of God is going on or when
[58:02] the word of God is being preached or
[58:03] something like that you've just feel so
[58:05] joyful in your heart and you feel like
[58:07] laughing and and you know it has
[58:09] happened to me many times you know I'm
[58:11] worshiping and I just laugh and laugh
[58:13] and laugh why because I'm joyful in my
[58:15] heart
[58:16] hallelujah or maybe when I'm greeting
[58:19] one brother you know I'm just laughing
[58:20] all the time oh God bless you my brother
[58:22] and I'm smiling all the way you know the
[58:24] people of the world will translate that
[58:26] to mean that you have a lot of money
[58:28] right because for them they are only
[58:31] joyful when they have something of the
[58:33] material wealth but a believer
[58:36] has Joy from the heart
[58:39] Joy from the soul and our that Joy let
[58:43] me tell you you should never let
[58:45] anything take away that Joy because that
[58:47] Joy is the believer's strength
[58:50] when the moment you reach when you feel
[58:52] you have no joy my brother go to prayer
[58:55] because you need that joy to be revived
[58:58] every minute of your life but when that
[59:01] Joy leaves you you know it left you know
[59:04] it left David one time but it left David
[59:07] because David had sinned and he had he
[59:10] had murdered and he had a committed
[59:13] adultery and that's why that Joy left so
[59:16] he went you see the spirit of God never
[59:18] left really because if you're still with
[59:19] the Holy Ghost no matter what you do the
[59:21] Holy Ghost does not leave but you see
[59:22] what left him was the joy of Salvation
[59:25] and he came before the Lord and he said
[59:27] oh God restore the joy of my salvation
[59:31] and you see when he prayed God restored
[59:33] it and he was joyful again
[59:35] are you hearing me
[59:38] so the believer has Joy from within that
[59:43] Joy comes from your soul no sickness can
[59:46] take it away no sin can take it nothing
[59:48] can take it away that Joy should be in
[59:51] there but when you get into things then
[59:53] Briars and then it takes that away when
[59:55] you go into prayer God restores that way
[59:57] because that Joy is your strength
[59:59] and then notice the people of the world
[1:00:02] don't have that instead
[1:00:05] the devil gives them things
[1:00:07] to
[1:00:09] to spike them and bring them something
[1:00:11] which looks like the joy of the Lord so
[1:00:13] the devil gives them Bang
[1:00:16] weed
[1:00:18] cigarettes
[1:00:20] alcohol
[1:00:22] what else
[1:00:24] fornication
[1:00:26] money
[1:00:28] gambling
[1:00:30] come on
[1:00:31] movies
[1:00:34] come on
[1:00:36] huh
[1:00:37] football
[1:00:40] and things that will give you Joy but
[1:00:44] for a moment
[1:00:46] it is it looks like Joy
[1:00:48] but it is for a moment it wears off
[1:00:51] quickly
[1:00:54] says a Believer when you come to the
[1:00:57] Lord it is hard to be a Christian
[1:00:58] because you have to adjust yourself from
[1:01:02] one life of gaity and pleasures of the
[1:01:06] world you have to add you must adjust
[1:01:09] yourself you have to adjust yourself
[1:01:11] from that to another life so it's not
[1:01:14] all Dandy and wonderful because it's a
[1:01:17] battle
[1:01:18] you have battling to to to to to to
[1:01:21] adjust yourself from that kind of thing
[1:01:23] you see you have to address yourself
[1:01:25] from that kind of Lifestyle to another
[1:01:28] life of consecration to God you have got
[1:01:31] to realize just yourself over into this
[1:01:34] other side so don't think it was easy
[1:01:36] for Ruth Hallelujah it was not easy for
[1:01:40] Ruth when Ruth had to re-adjust herself
[1:01:43] from this life
[1:01:45] to another life
[1:01:47] and Ruth had to adjust herself from
[1:01:50] being in a land where plenty where there
[1:01:52] was plenty to eat and everything
[1:01:54] respected to our people that was
[1:01:55] laughing making fun of her into a land
[1:01:58] she gleaned in the field for what she
[1:02:01] ate put it in her scarf and take it home
[1:02:04] and beat it out and make some bread and
[1:02:06] her and her mother did it imagine I
[1:02:08] wanted to imagine but they can put that
[1:02:10] off imagine that Ruth
[1:02:13] she came from a land where she had
[1:02:16] everything food was done you know they
[1:02:17] were very happy and initially before the
[1:02:20] feminist struck and
[1:02:22] and actually that's the reason even why
[1:02:24] now me and uh and who else and El
[1:02:28] mileage and his family they left
[1:02:30] Bethlehem to go to the land of MOA
[1:02:32] because there was enough food plenty so
[1:02:34] look
[1:02:36] when they went down there
[1:02:38] they found everything they needed so
[1:02:41] Ruth was used to a life of gaity
[1:02:44] Ruth was used to a life of Pleasures
[1:02:47] Ruth was used to a life you know I mean
[1:02:50] to be your question is
[1:02:57] Ruth was used to that kind of Pleasures
[1:03:00] a life of yeah you know hype hype hype
[1:03:03] kind of life and but now it was a time
[1:03:07] for her amen the prophet says she had to
[1:03:10] adjust
[1:03:12] from that kind of life to another kind
[1:03:16] of life and that is not an entirely
[1:03:19] Pleasant thing
[1:03:21] it is something filled with self-denial
[1:03:25] it is something filled with the
[1:03:27] sacrifices it is something filled with
[1:03:29] sometimes even sadness because it is as
[1:03:32] if you're losing in order to attain
[1:03:34] something new but I tell you as a
[1:03:37] Believer every believer must experience
[1:03:39] that
[1:03:40] when you feel you are adjusting from
[1:03:42] this to that it is not easy
[1:03:45] but you have to serve God
[1:03:48] amen every boy your girl brother sister
[1:03:51] man or woman that comes to the Lord must
[1:03:54] serve God but you can't serve god
[1:03:57] without adjusting yourself
[1:03:59] you have to faster the just yourself all
[1:04:02] right we'll carry on here and he says
[1:04:04] and Ruth how to adjust herself from
[1:04:07] being in a land where plenty okay I just
[1:04:09] read that for you all right I'll go on
[1:04:11] down here it says when she was there
[1:04:13] they come to find out
[1:04:15] while she was gleaning or going to Green
[1:04:17] now she made a decision
[1:04:20] that was her deciding now the next thing
[1:04:23] that she was to do is to serve and
[1:04:26] that's the church and that's what the
[1:04:28] church has to do
[1:04:29] the church after making your decision
[1:04:32] you have to serve tell somebody you have
[1:04:35] to serve
[1:04:37] serve God according to his diagram
[1:04:40] listen
[1:04:42] serve God according to his diagram
[1:04:44] according to his blueprint you must
[1:04:47] serve God Ruth making the decision now
[1:04:49] Ruth serving and her decision now watch
[1:04:52] just a minute now she goes into the
[1:04:54] field to Green now you must serve God
[1:04:57] tell somebody you must serve God one
[1:04:59] more time
[1:05:00] you must serve God this should be
[1:05:02] according to his blueprint
[1:05:04] not according to your desires
[1:05:07] not according to your am I preaching to
[1:05:10] somebody not according to your cravings
[1:05:12] not according to your wants but
[1:05:15] according to the blueprint
[1:05:18] you must serve God and a servant obeys
[1:05:21] the master regardless of the conditions
[1:05:24] the master sets for you you obey a
[1:05:27] servant each of us is the servant each
[1:05:29] of us must be a servant of God not only
[1:05:32] the preachers or the ones who are on the
[1:05:34] pulpit are servants every believer in
[1:05:37] the body is a servant must be a servant
[1:05:39] of God both woman and man we all must
[1:05:42] serve just like Ruth served you
[1:05:45] represent each of us we represent the
[1:05:48] entire Christian Nation remember our
[1:05:50] nation is of above and our spirit must
[1:05:52] be the Holy Spirit and therefore we must
[1:05:54] all serve under that blueprint which is
[1:05:57] the word of God that that God has given
[1:05:59] to us in our time
[1:06:01] in a message says we would see Jesus and
[1:06:04] I don't believe that there is anybody
[1:06:05] that has ever at any time ever heard or
[1:06:08] read of Jesus but what would long to see
[1:06:12] him I am sure that we would it will be
[1:06:15] our desire
[1:06:17] the desire of every heart of
[1:06:18] Christianity to see the Lord Jesus
[1:06:21] that's why we live by
[1:06:23] that's why we lay aside everything to
[1:06:26] try to live so that we will be able to
[1:06:28] see him someday
[1:06:31] but I wonder if the scriptures plainly
[1:06:33] say that he is the same yesterday than
[1:06:35] forever then why can't we see him today
[1:06:38] I will say the reason why we don't see
[1:06:40] him today is because we many people want
[1:06:43] to see him but they are not willing to
[1:06:45] labor and wait
[1:06:47] we are not willing to labor in prayer we
[1:06:50] are not willing to labor in fasting we
[1:06:52] are not willing to live but we just want
[1:06:54] a life of deity and you know joy and
[1:06:56] happiness but this joy that the world
[1:06:58] gives but you know God Jesus Christ also
[1:07:00] has the joy he gives and the joy he
[1:07:02] gives is permanent friend if you accept
[1:07:04] the joy that amen this word gives you
[1:07:06] let me tell you one time try it out if
[1:07:08] you feel sad try to enter into prayer
[1:07:11] and fasting if you feel like lonely try
[1:07:13] to identifying and prayer and then all
[1:07:15] of a sudden you'll feel God is giving
[1:07:17] you Joy and speakable and full of glory
[1:07:19] and you want to sing songs and you want
[1:07:21] to Rejoice why because amen amen there
[1:07:24] is a fasting within you a fasting to
[1:07:27] serve God assassin to live for him but
[1:07:29] you see the devil takes that fast many
[1:07:31] times and you he wants to satisfy it
[1:07:33] with the things of the world
[1:07:35] but if you can be able to take that fast
[1:07:38] and be satisfied with the things of God
[1:07:41] then that will be a permanent a
[1:07:43] permanent Joy
[1:07:45] now
[1:07:47] in talking about servant or being
[1:07:49] servants and how Ruth served I cannot
[1:07:51] finish without talking about
[1:07:55] this quality and the message the
[1:07:57] territorian church age where the Prophet
[1:08:00] explains very powerful points and as I
[1:08:02] go through them brother you find out for
[1:08:03] me so you can put it for the people and
[1:08:05] as I read it I wanted to follow closely
[1:08:07] very very powerful points there he says
[1:08:09] in those dark and Dreadful years the
[1:08:12] True Vine held its love for God and the
[1:08:15] love of the Brethren and I want to say
[1:08:18] in the dark and the Dreadful time when
[1:08:21] you are in your darker moments are you
[1:08:23] hearing me
[1:08:24] when you're in your dark moments in your
[1:08:27] low moments there is one thing that
[1:08:29] should not leave you the love for God
[1:08:31] and the love for the brethren
[1:08:33] see and he says I know your service
[1:08:36] Jesus said
[1:08:38] he that is the greatest of all is
[1:08:41] servant to all
[1:08:44] a wise man commented on that saying here
[1:08:48] is what he said only history will prove
[1:08:52] the truth of that dictum that man that
[1:08:56] man was right all the truly
[1:09:00] great men of history have been servants
[1:09:03] they they who demanded to be served they
[1:09:07] who oppressed they who sow to always be
[1:09:10] at the head have gone down in shame
[1:09:15] and I will repeat that for the interest
[1:09:17] of those who might have missed it he
[1:09:19] says all the truly great men of history
[1:09:22] have been servants they who demanded to
[1:09:25] be served
[1:09:27] they who oppressed they who sought to
[1:09:30] always be at the head have gone down in
[1:09:33] Shem
[1:09:35] who was the according to you who was the
[1:09:37] greatest man on Earth that has ever been
[1:09:39] born by a woman
[1:09:43] raise up your hand and tell her tell us
[1:09:47] who was the greatest man on Earth
[1:09:50] yes my sister
[1:09:52] Hitler
[1:09:54] okay
[1:09:55] Hitler was according to the eye to many
[1:09:58] he was a great man right but the
[1:10:00] question is who was it the greatest of
[1:10:03] all that was ever that ever lived on
[1:10:05] earth
[1:10:07] yes
[1:10:09] Jesus
[1:10:11] he said Jesus
[1:10:13] but you are saying it with the full of
[1:10:14] Shem
[1:10:16] do you believe it
[1:10:18] say it like you believe it
[1:10:20] all right now listen friends Jesus I
[1:10:25] would also agree with you my brother
[1:10:26] that he was the greatest man that ever
[1:10:29] lived on earth
[1:10:30] now
[1:10:32] do you realize
[1:10:34] that Jesus
[1:10:36] knelt down
[1:10:39] and watch the Disciples of it
[1:10:42] have you ever thought about that Jesus
[1:10:44] was a servant
[1:10:49] and he says
[1:10:51] now sister where did Hitler go where is
[1:10:54] he now he went down in shame
[1:10:57] every man because Hitler was one of
[1:10:59] those that wanted to be served that were
[1:11:01] oppressing
[1:11:02] those that were that demanded to be
[1:11:05] served and those that you know wanted
[1:11:08] always to be the head they went down in
[1:11:09] Shem that's why if you want to see a
[1:11:12] great leader you will always see them
[1:11:14] serving
[1:11:16] great leaders serve great people serve
[1:11:19] and I want to say great Christians serve
[1:11:24] you see it is always say that even the
[1:11:28] church for example that people who clean
[1:11:31] the church should be the poor ones Among
[1:11:33] Us
[1:11:34] but that's a very poor mentality of
[1:11:36] anybody who has ever had it
[1:11:38] I remember in growing up and you know as
[1:11:42] a young man in the church together with
[1:11:44] the others that we grew up with we were
[1:11:45] always the one cleaning the church not
[1:11:47] because we had nothing to do we were
[1:11:49] students and we were busy but you see
[1:11:51] you would always come and make sure we
[1:11:52] come earlier than everybody else and we
[1:11:55] clean the church thoroughly we clean the
[1:11:58] pulpit area we clean everywhere and we
[1:12:00] make sure that by the time others come
[1:12:01] everything is perfect that is serving so
[1:12:05] I believe that every believer you know
[1:12:08] must be a servant
[1:12:11] every believer must be a servant you
[1:12:14] know it's not only those who have
[1:12:16] nothing or who have lit of this world
[1:12:18] these things that should be servants
[1:12:20] that should be the ones to serve you you
[1:12:23] know that you are the big one or because
[1:12:25] you have more money there's nothing like
[1:12:27] that in the Kingdom of God in the
[1:12:29] Kingdom where I come from Amen in the
[1:12:31] Kingdom of Christians all of us are
[1:12:33] servants must be servants we all must be
[1:12:36] servants you see and he says all those
[1:12:39] who demand it to be served they who were
[1:12:41] oppressed they who sought to they who
[1:12:44] oppressed they who sought to always be
[1:12:46] at the head have gone down in shame
[1:12:49] even when the very rich are condemned by
[1:12:53] God when they have not used their wealth
[1:12:55] rights
[1:12:57] can you imagine even the very rich when
[1:12:59] you are rich and you have not used your
[1:13:01] money in the right way as a Believer you
[1:13:04] are condemned by God
[1:13:06] but look into history and you will find
[1:13:08] out that that truly the great where
[1:13:11] those who served others can you say Amen
[1:13:14] to that history can never Acclaim those
[1:13:17] for whom much was done but it will
[1:13:19] forever praise those who did much for
[1:13:23] others
[1:13:25] Hallelujah he history does not say oh
[1:13:28] brother so also received a lot from
[1:13:30] history whatever it is in the Bible yet
[1:13:33] you will always see about amen names of
[1:13:36] those who did something for somebody
[1:13:37] else here we are reading about Ruth
[1:13:40] what did Ruth do Ruth went and green in
[1:13:44] a field of a stranger rules when she
[1:13:46] reached the Bethlehem she didn't you
[1:13:48] know sleep in her mother in law's house
[1:13:50] and said well at least we have a room
[1:13:52] where we can sleep let us just see hey
[1:13:54] you know sleep here in our language you
[1:13:55] said
[1:13:58] foreign
[1:14:12] looking for me no him and Ruth went out
[1:14:16] there in the garden in the field where
[1:14:19] the poor servants were gleading and she
[1:14:22] said let me clean something here for me
[1:14:25] and for you mother-in-law
[1:14:27] great people serve Hallelujah
[1:14:31] amen Esther was another great woman amen
[1:14:33] Esther did not just lie there amen after
[1:14:36] all I'm a Queen's wife nobody will touch
[1:14:38] me for you you can die but for me I am
[1:14:40] favored I am blessed by God I am highly
[1:14:42] favored for you you can die there for me
[1:14:45] I will not die but when Ruth when Esther
[1:14:47] had it in her ears you said what
[1:14:49] they are going to kill my people no no
[1:14:52] no no no no I am a servant of my people
[1:14:54] and therefore even if I am a queen I
[1:14:57] don't care about that I am going to fast
[1:14:59] for three days and three nights for my
[1:15:02] people
[1:15:03] the queen herself she became a servant
[1:15:07] she didn't say because I'm a queen and
[1:15:09] I'm loved by my by my husband remove
[1:15:11] that brother and I'm loved by my husband
[1:15:14] I know that everything is well you know
[1:15:16] what did she do she said
[1:15:18] let me let me fast for three days and
[1:15:20] then I go before my husband she knew it
[1:15:23] wasn't about the fasting rather it
[1:15:25] wasn't about her being the queen it was
[1:15:28] about her serving serving in prayer
[1:15:30] serving in fasting so she went there the
[1:15:33] women fasted for three days prayed for
[1:15:35] three days and then came boldly before
[1:15:37] the king amen why do we boldly go before
[1:15:40] the king because we have been serving
[1:15:42] him
[1:15:44] let me tell you that man who was going
[1:15:46] to die
[1:15:47] I don't remember his name the king who
[1:15:49] was going to die what was his name that
[1:15:50] the prophet had told that you have only
[1:15:53] a limited time
[1:15:54] it was Hezekiah
[1:15:57] and and
[1:15:59] you know what
[1:16:00] what hindered God from killing him
[1:16:03] was a life of service
[1:16:05] you see he reminded God everything he
[1:16:07] had done for him he said oh my God how
[1:16:10] come you're going to kill me now because
[1:16:12] she will remember everything I've done
[1:16:13] for you I've done a ABC before you have
[1:16:15] served I've served you all my life I've
[1:16:16] been he said okay now I'll add you some
[1:16:19] more time
[1:16:20] praise the name of the Lord if you serve
[1:16:22] God my friend Hallelujah you are going
[1:16:24] to be on the book on the on the right
[1:16:26] side of the book of books of God why
[1:16:28] because you are a servant
[1:16:30] Hallelujah Ruth was a servant amen I
[1:16:34] don't know you know how a man how a
[1:16:36] woman can sit in the church being a part
[1:16:38] of the body of Christ and you have never
[1:16:40] seen or found or had the desire to do
[1:16:42] anything in the in the house of the Lord

[1:16:55] yourself useful you try to find and see
[1:16:57] what am I doing what am I doing to

[1:17:02] if you can't go out there to preach send
[1:17:05] someone how do you send someone by
[1:17:06] giving them money even if you don't have
[1:17:08] so much time to go out there and preach
[1:17:10] then or then you know take out of what
[1:17:13] you have worked and then give somebody
[1:17:14] else who can go and then let them go and
[1:17:17] preach the gospel but you see every one
[1:17:19] of us should be an active member of the
[1:17:21] body of Christ Brothers young men you
[1:17:23] can't just sit in the church try to find
[1:17:25] something go on the on the streets and
[1:17:27] preach if you can't if you are not
[1:17:29] gifted to do that you can come down in
[1:17:31] the church and kneel and pray for the
[1:17:33] ones who are going if you can't do that
[1:17:35] unless you bring somebody to church do
[1:17:37] something make yourself busy you know

[1:19:26] I told myself how can I come in China
[1:19:29] and just to stick to myself and just

[1:19:53] was meeting you know you just stand like

[1:20:40] this that even then at least I made
[1:20:43] myself useful we must find you know when

[1:21:34] a stagnant part of the body be a useful
[1:21:37] part of the body do something where your
[1:21:39] place wherever you are come on do
[1:21:42] something amen be moved amen
[1:21:56] your life
[1:21:58] you are risking your life
[1:22:01] Hallelujah
[1:22:02] do something do something we have to be
[1:22:05] oh my God help me I don't want to dwell
[1:22:07] so much on this but something's putting
[1:22:09] me to say more on this we can't be
[1:22:11] whether you're a sister or a brother
[1:22:13] sisters you have even more work to do
[1:22:15] you have more work to do even by living
[1:22:17] the life of Jesus Christ by living a
[1:22:19] life of character you're preaching to
[1:22:20] thousands out there you know you can go
[1:22:23] down there and pray pray for your
[1:22:24] husband pray for your home pray for the
[1:22:26] church pray let me tell you the church
[1:22:28] cannot move without prayer the church
[1:22:30] cannot even progress without people men
[1:22:32] and women praying and fasting
[1:22:35] there has to be praying and fasting they
[1:22:37] have to be the Zeal there has to be that
[1:22:40] desire within men and women of God to
[1:22:42] see things happening in the church
[1:22:45] and that can't happen without people
[1:22:47] serving and how do you solve by being on
[1:22:49] you know on Zeal by being on fire you
[1:22:52] know when you see someone
[1:22:54] you know someone is becoming weak and
[1:22:56] don't just begin talking against them
[1:22:58] and you know spoiling and you know
[1:23:00] taking the whole thing around and
[1:23:01] telling the oh do you know Brother Sam
[1:23:02] says like that no brother when you see
[1:23:04] something like it should take you before
[1:23:06] God you know that's how a servant Acts
[1:23:09] Hallelujah
[1:23:11] let us do something
[1:23:13] you see even the rich are condemned even
[1:23:16] if you have your money it is your money
[1:23:17] but you are condemned if you don't use
[1:23:19] it right but look into history you see
[1:23:22] you'll find that they're truly great
[1:23:23] where those who served others history
[1:23:25] can never Acclaim those
[1:23:28] who for whom much was done but it will
[1:23:31] forever praise those who did much for
[1:23:33] others now let us apply that to
[1:23:35] ourselves even as the son of man came
[1:23:38] not to be ministered unto but to
[1:23:40] minister so we are to follow that
[1:23:43] example see him as he bows himself over
[1:23:46] the feet for the apostles and washes
[1:23:49] their tired and that defeat he said you
[1:23:52] don't know now what I am doing but you
[1:23:54] will know Hereafter but what you see me
[1:23:57] doing you ought also to do let us watch
[1:24:00] one another's Feet friends
[1:24:02] let us serve one another he became a
[1:24:05] servant in order that God could Elevate
[1:24:07] him to the highest Heights and one day
[1:24:09] in the Judgment of the Saints we are
[1:24:11] going to hear him say Well done good and
[1:24:14] faithful Lord now well done good and
[1:24:17] faithful servants
[1:24:19] Hallelujah
[1:24:21] so if you served God by praying if you
[1:24:24] serve God by song reading if you serve
[1:24:26] God by you know handling cleaning the
[1:24:28] church or playing instruments or
[1:24:30] interpreting or preaching or
[1:24:31] evangelizing if you serve God by
[1:24:33] bringing somebody to church by
[1:24:35] witnessing if you serve the god like
[1:24:37] that one day you are going to hear that
[1:24:39] voice in your ears well done my good and
[1:24:42] faithful servant
[1:24:45] Hallelujah that's what he's saying here
[1:24:48] and I believe that's how it will obey
[1:24:51] well done my good and faithful servant
[1:24:54] it is hard to be always a servant it is
[1:24:56] hard not easy it is hard but those who
[1:24:59] spend and are spent for others will one
[1:25:02] day be seated with him in his throne
[1:25:05] it will be worth it all
[1:25:07] then let us labor for the master from
[1:25:10] this done till Setting Sun let us talk
[1:25:12] of all his wondrous love and care and
[1:25:14] when all of life is over and our work on
[1:25:16] Earth is done and the role is Called Up
[1:25:18] Yonder I will be
[1:25:22] eternal life
[1:25:25] do you know what it will be
[1:25:28] for you if some brother or sister comes
[1:25:31] to you with need
[1:25:33] and you have your own program and you
[1:25:35] have your money
[1:25:36] and you tell them brother I'll pray for
[1:25:38] you do you know what it will be
[1:25:41] on that day for you
[1:25:43] you have withheld your hand from service
[1:25:47] you see the Bible says this is even the
[1:25:49] Bible talks about it say brother comes
[1:25:51] to you you he's in need and you have
[1:25:53] something and you just tell him brother
[1:25:54] they failed God bless you God you know
[1:25:56] increase you and instead of reaching
[1:25:58] your pocket and giving him to him that
[1:26:01] has need it's not always money it can be
[1:26:03] Comfort somebody can come to you for
[1:26:05] Comfort or maybe they need a Grace to
[1:26:08] overcome something they need prayer
[1:26:10] someone just send something on the
[1:26:12] WhatsApp group or maybe to use called
[1:26:14] you and says brother pray for me you say
[1:26:16] all right I'll pray and you don't pray
[1:26:18] and you don't pray
[1:26:19] see you withheld your hand from service
[1:26:22] but brother if someone says pray for me
[1:26:24] and maybe they have a need prayer for me
[1:26:25] brother take it serious you're a servant
[1:26:28] go down on your knees and pray even if
[1:26:30] it's for one minute pray for them that
[1:26:33] is the life of service you are giving
[1:26:35] your time your life is being spent for
[1:26:37] others you are doing it for others
[1:26:40] eternal life is living for others not
[1:26:43] living for ourselves or our own families
[1:26:45] but living for others
[1:26:47] God help us friends to be servants and

[1:37:07] they may not see it yet but I'm telling
[1:37:09] your life has changed permanently and
[1:37:11] whenever you come to church here to sit
[1:37:13] down you are sitting on the same table
[1:37:15] dining table with a king because the
[1:37:18] king is dining with you through his wife
[1:37:21] Hallelujah that's why with good
[1:37:24] authority I can say you who listen to
[1:37:27] this message you can never be the same
[1:37:29] again
[1:37:31] because this message you know comes to
[1:37:34] amen amen change you completely change
[1:37:37] you completely and and this is exactly
[1:37:39] what happened with Ruth you know from
[1:37:40] that dining table do you know where else
[1:37:42] you went
[1:37:44] oh my God
[1:37:46] it's just so amazing
[1:37:48] just so amazing from that dining table
[1:37:51] the next place she went to
[1:37:54] was the feet of boys
[1:37:58] Hallelujah
[1:38:00] and we'll talk about that in the next
[1:38:02] service Ruth resting
[1:38:04] but before we talk about that resting
[1:38:06] part we'll leave that part and we'll
[1:38:08] talk about the resting part and then the
[1:38:09] reward part but here we're talking about
[1:38:11] Ruth serving Ruth was serving but you
[1:38:14] see the service was leading us somewhere
[1:38:17] you don't just come and God rewards you
[1:38:19] back
[1:38:20] from glory to glory but you want from
[1:38:22] glory to glory but you are not living
[1:38:23] you you it is a glory to glory to glory
[1:38:26] to glory it's not from grass to Grace
[1:38:28] like from grass to Glory it is from
[1:38:31] glory to glory to glory to glory God
[1:38:36] wants to lift you up but in stages don't
[1:38:38] outrun God
[1:38:41] some of us we want to outrun God you
[1:38:44] want to run faster than God imagine if
[1:38:46] Ruth had come
[1:38:48] and she said ah Master let me just sleep
[1:38:50] at your feet
[1:38:54] the Ruth would have said can you take
[1:38:56] away this silly girl take her out and
[1:38:58] throw her out what is what a nonsense
[1:39:00] girl this is
[1:39:02] she would have missed out
[1:39:05] but she had to take it slowly she had to
[1:39:08] follow the leadership of the king see
[1:39:10] yeah of Boaz rather he was the king he's
[1:39:13] our King so he's like okay now it's time
[1:39:15] for serving she said okay let me begin
[1:39:16] with the serving who knows I don't know
[1:39:19] what will happen I don't even have a
[1:39:20] husband I don't know but I've given all
[1:39:22] my chaos to him her concern was not of
[1:39:24] finding her husband she wasn't there
[1:39:30] you know
[1:39:32] maybe Boaz will see me let me put my
[1:39:35] boobs outside and then she prays up our
[1:39:37] breasts outside that that Boaz will see
[1:39:40] her nonsense she didn't do that she knew
[1:39:42] she needed a husband but she was not
[1:39:44] going to create a car she was going to
[1:39:46] do it in the right way
[1:39:48] whatever you need you need manner you
[1:39:50] need the husband you need a wife you
[1:39:51] don't know you don't need to do it the
[1:39:53] way of the world brother you don't need
[1:39:56] to do the way of the wild sister see
[1:39:58] follow the pattern follow the path and
[1:40:00] everything will be all right and see the
[1:40:02] next thing she did was to just to go and
[1:40:04] serve I said maybe she even went in in
[1:40:06] serving clothes I remember the first
[1:40:08] time I met my wife
[1:40:10] it was in a convention and it was
[1:40:13] dressed in mother's Union do you know
[1:40:14] mother's Union
[1:40:19] she was just in mother's Union and you
[1:40:22] know so I didn't even notice her because
[1:40:24] she was dressed in mother's Union so but
[1:40:26] you find these days younger people go to
[1:40:27] go conversions and they are spacing
[1:40:30] themselves up so that now brother can
[1:40:32] see me you know even they change they
[1:40:33] are working you know because because
[1:40:36] they have a wrong spit on them you see
[1:40:38] but once can say something like that
[1:40:40] right Mark when you say something like
[1:40:42] that you just look away
[1:40:44] because you know what you are looking
[1:40:45] for you see but you see when I imagine
[1:40:49] Ruth was there and maybe she was dressed
[1:40:50] in mother's Union also because she had
[1:40:52] gone to work A working woman is not a A
[1:40:55] Chorus girl
[1:40:58] but you Brothers you'll be there looking
[1:40:59] for chorus guys for a wife
[1:41:01] it is a shame
[1:41:03] see this brother was what this sister
[1:41:05] was dressed in a very I don't know in
[1:41:09] decent plus way I mean decent plus
[1:41:11] decent meaning
[1:41:17] she had overdressed because she had gone
[1:41:20] through the garden when you go to the
[1:41:21] Garden you don't dress to impress you
[1:41:23] dress to overdress because you are going
[1:41:25] to the Garden that's how she addressed
[1:41:27] but still she caught the eye of Boaz
[1:41:31] still she caught the eye about us and
[1:41:33] the boys were like ah who is that girl
[1:41:35] and the next thing she was being told
[1:41:38] come on a dining with me and still she
[1:41:40] would go even after she left the dining
[1:41:42] do you know that she went back to her
[1:41:43] mother in law still and she would come
[1:41:45] back to Glendale the following day she
[1:41:47] didn't say you know me I've been with
[1:41:48] the King therefore I will never clean
[1:41:50] again I'll never go to dig again ah what
[1:41:51] are you talking about even if you have
[1:41:53] been with the king so what
[1:41:55] you even if you have been with the King
[1:41:57] be yourself be yourself
[1:41:59] you know you'll be a place some people
[1:42:01] you want to live above Who We Are
[1:42:05] you fine you find people Brothers even
[1:42:08] some brothers do it because they want to
[1:42:10] impress girls they want to marry you
[1:42:12] find him renting a very good car yeah
[1:42:14] you find brother
[1:42:16] I don't know which brother should use
[1:42:18] this I don't want to get issues which
[1:42:20] brother should I use who is volunteering
[1:42:21] yeah brother Ivan I used you
[1:42:24] so you find brother Ivan renting renting
[1:42:28] a Mercedes-Benz and and you know or
[1:42:31] taking it from his brother and saying
[1:42:32] you say brother when I'm going to do
[1:42:34] something very important then I will
[1:42:36] come back
[1:42:37] and then he reaches there and then he
[1:42:39] you know he he you know closes the the
[1:42:42] car with a big bump so that they can
[1:42:44] know that he's done closing it and then
[1:42:46] he comes out you know working with his
[1:42:48] shoe which is like this and then you
[1:42:51] know try to and then you know they go
[1:42:53] there the restaurant then they begin to
[1:42:55] tell this sister you see the sister you
[1:42:57] see God has given us blessings and you
[1:42:59] know we are not working even at my age
[1:43:01] God has given me such a castle what do
[1:43:03] you think he will do for us when we get
[1:43:04] married
[1:43:05] but actually this brother is trying to
[1:43:07] increase his the place when he is still
[1:43:10] on the lower place you don't need to do
[1:43:12] that you need to be satisfied
[1:43:15] there are two things that the Bible says
[1:43:17] are great again I was talking about it
[1:43:19] with the brother today two things one
[1:43:21] one of them is godliness
[1:43:24] yeah godliness another one is
[1:43:27] contentment another one is what
[1:43:30] and he says godliness with the
[1:43:33] contentment is
[1:43:35] great gain Hallelujah
[1:43:38] if you want to gain greatness
[1:43:41] then my brother
[1:43:42] have godliness
[1:43:45] live for others
[1:43:48] live a Christian Life live simple and
[1:43:51] then be contented
[1:43:54] what has God given you in life
[1:43:56] be contented some people have one wife
[1:43:58] but they are not contented they want to
[1:44:00] get a second one
[1:44:01] you see that's why you they will always
[1:44:03] be in issues
[1:44:05] and then they have time for school fees
[1:44:07] comes they are scratching their head
[1:44:08] they're running all around because they
[1:44:09] have this wife this wife this wife this
[1:44:11] wife this wife why they were not
[1:44:12] contented
[1:44:14] and and some people you know God has
[1:44:16] given me clothes they're very nice
[1:44:17] clothes but you're not contented with
[1:44:19] them you want more
[1:44:21] you know someone God has given you a
[1:44:23] very slim body you are you know you are
[1:44:25] you you are you are you know you are
[1:44:27] portable you know but you want a very
[1:44:29] big body you're like oh God me I'm not
[1:44:31] contented with this I want more look now
[1:44:34] even maybe the other is looking at me
[1:44:35] because I'm very slim because I'm not
[1:44:37] only look at even in my bones look I'm
[1:44:39] not feeling happy about myself you are
[1:44:41] not contented you see another one is
[1:44:44] very fat God has given them a very fat
[1:44:45] body like who here
[1:44:47] [Music]
[1:44:48] so God has given a very big body you are
[1:44:51] you are supposed to be big and happy you
[1:44:53] know you can say God has given a big
[1:44:55] blessing of a big body but you're also
[1:44:57] not content and you're like oh God I am
[1:44:58] very saggy my body is very sad I wish I
[1:45:00] was tired Slimmer like the other one not
[1:45:03] contented you see another one has a very
[1:45:05] nice skin but they want a lighter one
[1:45:07] other one they want to be a musungu
[1:45:09] another one wants to be darker another
[1:45:10] one wants to be reader another one wants
[1:45:12] to be whiter another one wants to have
[1:45:14] long hair another wants to have shorter
[1:45:16] another one wants everybody is not
[1:45:17] contented but the Bible says godliness
[1:45:20] with the contentment is great gain
[1:45:24] as Believers we must learn to be
[1:45:26] contented with the the little the match
[1:45:29] we have
[1:45:31] everything God has given to you at your
[1:45:33] level it is what you want you to have
[1:45:36] and there is more coming but for now be
[1:45:39] contented

[1:45:49] still walking no way it can't happen
[1:45:51] and then they go the other one I want to
[1:45:55] show them no no they can't pass me they
[1:45:57] are not contented

[1:46:00] what God has made you be contented you
[1:46:02] see God has given us blessings here at
[1:46:04] dvf but there are things he has not yet
[1:46:06] given us and we should be contented
[1:46:19] and what God wants us to have in the
[1:46:22] right time we shall have it
[1:46:24] whatever he wants you to have in the
[1:46:26] right time you shall have a Ruth was
[1:46:28] supposed to be contented and I thank God
