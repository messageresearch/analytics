[18:38] tonight
[18:40] amen um and and so before we are going
[18:43] to go to the book of second Kings
[18:44] chapter
[18:50] 4 but just before we turn there I would
[18:52] like to just give you a a few uh two hot
[18:57] testimonies
[19:02] uh there is um brother praise has a
[19:05] friend at
[19:08] school uh they both in senior
[19:12] 3 so this young man um her mother is a
[19:16] preacher
[19:18] [Music]
[19:20] p uh but but for a while now I think
[19:24] it's been how long since 1 year is it a
[19:28] year yet no not a year a few
[19:32] months we've been trying he has been
[19:34] trying to reach reach to
[19:36] him
[19:38] message and uh he has he even brought he
[19:42] invited me to say I went to school I met
[19:44] him and then the young man also one time
[19:47] he came at home we shared a little
[19:50] bit so they've been at home praise did
[19:54] not have a
[19:55] phone but when he got a phone
[19:58] he used it as an opportunity now to take
[20:01] itth at school so that they can be
[20:04] listening the young man can be listening
[20:06] to the message
[20:10] directly and so the young man got on
[20:15] fire he he sent me a
[20:18] letter I read it yesterday it was just
[20:22] amazing do you have it here no you have
[20:24] it here can you give it to me it's
[20:27] amazing it's just amazing
[20:29] praise God I thought this is good to
[20:32] encourage some of
[20:35] you letter in this
[20:38] booklet just he was having quite many
[20:42] questions out of what he has been
[20:43] listening
[20:46] to and just listen to it it just
[20:49] thrilled my heart I hope it will
[20:52] also it says Dear Pastor I greet you in
[20:54] the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:57] Christ it has been a long time since we
[20:59] last talked but by the grace of God what
[21:02] you told me has made a change in my
[21:09] life thanks to you and and my brother
[21:12] praise that I have been able to unveil
[21:14] the revelation of Our Lord through the
[21:16] power of the Holy
[21:22] Spirit say praise gave me a book for the
[21:26] seven Church ages
[21:29] which is very
[21:31] helpful especially when it comes to the
[21:33] godhead and the true
[21:37] baptism but though I am getting to
[21:39] understand the
[21:41] Revelation I have a few challenging
[21:43] questions on the
[21:45] way he says number one is Jesus Christ
[21:49] the first born the first of all the
[21:54] creation number two what are the
[21:57] dimensions that
[21:59] exist number three how many Heavens are
[22:03] there and what is in
[22:06] them number four how can I do the
[22:10] passion of my heart that is science as
[22:12] well as do the will of
[22:17] God number five how can I preach how can
[22:21] I preach to others tell me the
[22:25] steps number six I would also like to be
[22:29] listening to some of brother Bam's
[22:31] audios and praise had told me he will
[22:33] assist me with his MP3 because he used
[22:36] to bring his phone and I used to learn a
[22:38] lot but he stopped bringing his
[22:46] phone and he says may our Lord be with
[22:48] you until the end time end of time and
[22:52] another thing is I am not sure of my
[22:55] baptism
[22:56] now I feel like I wish to be baptized
[23:02] again
[23:04] Hallelujah and the questions are
[23:07] endless another question is how do you
[23:10] pray in Revelation how can I pray in the
[23:13] Revelation how do I know that I have the
[23:15] Holy
[23:16] Spirit how do I know that I'm speaking
[23:19] the right
[23:21] tongues it's endless and I said praise
[23:25] God where did he get all this question
[23:29] after hearing the message of
[23:32] the so I said the message has
[23:34] life to the seed not to everybody but to
[23:37] the
[23:39] seed he that has the seed of God in them
[23:41] when they hear the message the message
[23:43] quickens their their
[23:48] SE so the young man wants to be
[23:51] baptized he's in a hostel he can't be
[23:53] allowed to come out of school so that's
[23:55] why he had to send this
[23:56] letter
[24:00] and I'm yet to respond to
[24:02] it and I think in the Hol day we shall
[24:04] be baptizing him in the name
[24:07] of and the other testimony
[24:10] is fellowship that I've told you always
[24:13] to pray
[24:15] for sister brother
[24:18] sh
[24:21] friends so um yesterday so we now we we
[24:25] now moved it from Saturday to Monday
[24:30] so this Monday I was there once again
[24:32] for the first time
[24:35] actually and here's the amazing thing
[24:38] shame had shared because the other past
[24:40] monday had shared on to them on Malachi
[24:43] chapter
[24:45] 4 and he was emphasizing on verse
[24:49] two which says unto you that fear my
[24:53] name and here when I went back without
[24:56] knowing everything he shared that's
[24:57] exactly what I shared on as
[25:01] well and I was emphasizing on the name
[25:03] above all
[25:05] names and why the name of our Lord Jesus
[25:08] Christ why it is connected to
[25:11] Salvation and we Shar quite a lot of
[25:14] things on the line of
[25:16] Salvation the Judgment that is coming
[25:19] and the grace of God for our
[25:22] salvation and by the end of our
[25:25] sharing two young people decided to be
[25:30] bz and the big testimony is this
[25:33] one one of
[25:35] them is a young man that has been
[25:38] listening to us for a
[25:41] while but he has been opposing
[25:44] us and he's a brother to sister
[25:49] f but he made up his mind on
[25:53] Monday he said I've also decided I want
[25:56] to be baptized now
[25:58] praise God Amen these things should put
[26:01] us on
[26:03] fire Amen on fire not only to
[26:06] sit to continue sharing the word God has
[26:10] more seed out
[26:12] there that are hungering to hear this
[26:15] word and how will they come how will
[26:18] they hear they will hear it by
[26:21] you so may God use
[26:23] you praise God I thought those
[26:26] testimonies are very touching
[26:30] amen so this evening uh we are also
[26:33] speaking to evening by
[26:38] tabac so I would like to greet the
[26:40] Saints at evening on
[26:45] zoom in the name of our Lord
[26:48] Jesus so if you can all turn with me to
[26:51] Second Kings
[26:56] 4
[27:04] and we have already uh spoken on the
[27:08] ministry of Elijah in the end
[27:14] time and we've been speaking on this
[27:17] subject for quite a while
[27:22] now but to the Saints on Zoom I left up
[27:25] uh I left on somewhere I just it will
[27:27] just be a continuation for
[27:32] us and for all of us even here at the at
[27:34] the
[27:36] church it will be a
[27:40] continuation and uh just I have a few
[27:43] things that I have on my heart to speak
[27:44] to
[27:47] you may the Lord
[27:49] just you know give us inspiration to
[27:53] speak we are reading from vers
[27:56] 32
[28:00] and we shall read up to vers
[28:04] 36 I'll read verse by verse with my
[28:09] brother and when elishah was come into
[28:11] the house behold the
[28:14] child was dead and laid upon his
[28:19] [Music]
[28:26] bed went in there and shut the door upon
[28:30] um and he went in there and shut the
[28:34] door upon them Twain and prayed unto the
[28:37] [Music]
[28:41] Lord and he went up and lay upon the
[28:43] child and put his mouth upon his mouth
[28:46] and his eyes upon his eyes and his hand
[28:49] upon his hand and he stretched himself
[28:51] upon the child and the Flesh of the
[28:53] child Works
[28:56] warm
[29:11] then he returned and walked in the house
[29:13] to and fr and went up and stretched
[29:16] himself upon the child upon him and the
[29:19] child sneezed seven times and the child
[29:22] opened his
[29:26] eyes
[29:36] [Music]
[29:37] and he called
[29:39] gazi and he called gazi this is a verse
[29:43] 36 and said call this shunamite so he
[29:47] called her and when he was come in unto
[29:50] him he and when she was come in unto him
[29:54] he said take up thy son now
[30:09] amen let us pray father we commit
[30:12] ourselves to you at this
[30:15] moment Lord may you give me
[30:18] utterance may you just give Grace to us
[30:21] tonight for we do not know how to
[30:24] speak but may you give us utterance Lord
[30:28] give us inspiration father people that
[30:30] are listening to
[30:31] us oh God for these are the pches of
[30:35] your blood I pray that you reveal
[30:38] yourself to them that amen for your
[30:41] purpose that they will hear
[30:44] tonight will you open their eyes of
[30:46] understanding and may they see the
[30:48] deeper things of
[30:49] God in Jesus name amen amen you may be
[30:55] seated I'm speaking to to you today on
[30:58] the ministry of Elijah in the end time
[30:59] part
[31:03] seven and maybe for a little inspiration
[31:07] tonight a little phrase at the seventh
[31:10] time SE
[31:15] sneeze amen at the seventh time
[31:20] Snee so I want to say that we have
[31:23] established from all these things we've
[31:25] been looking at
[31:27] [Music]
[31:29] so we have established that the Bible
[31:31] teaches on the five comings of
[31:37] Elijah the first time Elijah
[31:40] came that was elah
[31:43] the and and and we've seen everything
[31:46] that elah the
[31:49] did he was
[31:51] anointed he was a prophet of
[31:54] restoration he rose the a child from the
[31:56] dead
[31:58] you know uh his ministry brought
[32:00] restored
[32:01] food restored life restored you know the
[32:05] power of
[32:06] God brought down
[32:09] rain you know went against the false
[32:13] prophets that was the first coming of
[32:17] Elijah and and the second time we see
[32:20] Elijah's
[32:23] Ministry in
[32:26] elishah because elishah received a
[32:28] double portion of the spirit which was
[32:30] upon
[32:34] Elijah so now I want to say it this way
[32:38] when we say the spirit of
[32:41] Elijah we do not really mean Elijah
[32:44] incarnating other
[32:50] people we are meaning that the spirit of
[32:53] God which was working upon
[32:56] Elijah
[32:59] in the nature that he
[33:02] worked he continued working again on
[33:05] other
[33:08] men in other
[33:11] Generations the second time It Came Upon
[33:14] elishah and when you see the ministry of
[33:18] Elisha listen the ministry of Elisha is
[33:21] really I can say h a duplicate of the
[33:24] ministry of
[33:25] Elijah
[33:28] [Music]
[33:31] everything elishah
[33:33] did is what Elijah had
[33:36] done but in a double
[33:40] portion so that's the second
[33:43] time we see Elijah's Ministry the third
[33:46] time we see Elijah's
[33:48] Ministry is through the ministry of John
[33:51] the
[33:53] Baptist now when John the Baptist came
[33:55] they did not know who who uh who he
[34:01] represented they asked him who he was
[34:05] and he said I'm the voice crying from
[34:06] the Wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[34:11] Lord make his path
[34:14] straight so John the Baptist
[34:17] again when Jesus came he said he was the
[34:21] Elijah which was for to
[34:25] come in many denominational
[34:29] circles they believe that John the
[34:32] Baptist was the one to finish the
[34:35] ministry of
[34:39] Elijah they understand listen they
[34:41] understand that
[34:43] John had the spirit of Elijah on
[34:46] him and they actually think that that
[34:49] Ministry ends with
[34:52] John but I want to tell you tonight the
[34:55] ministry of Elijah continues was on
[34:57] after
[35:00] John because John only uh fulfilled his
[35:06] portion of preparing the coming of the
[35:11] Lord turning the hearts of the fathers
[35:14] to the
[35:16] children which were the
[35:18] Jews previously not knowing Jesus
[35:22] Christ so the ministry of John prepared
[35:25] their hearts
[35:28] to receive the
[35:30] Messiah but you see the Bible says he
[35:32] was in the his ministry was in the power
[35:34] and spirit of
[35:39] Elijah but the people never
[35:42] understood at the time before the coming
[35:44] of the
[35:46] Messiah the people never understood that
[35:48] the ministry of
[35:50] John was actually in the power and
[35:53] spirit of
[35:55] Elijah they missed
[35:57] and because they missed it they also
[36:00] missed the coming of the
[36:03] Messiah when the Messiah came they never
[36:06] understood who he
[36:08] was why because they missed
[36:11] John when you miss the coming of
[36:14] Elijah you will miss the coming of the
[36:18] Messiah Elijah's
[36:20] Ministry only comes to prepare the
[36:23] people's hearts to receive the
[36:25] Messiah
[36:27] and so we found that John the Baptist
[36:29] was that third
[36:33] Elijah his name was
[36:35] John but his ministry was in the nature
[36:38] and in the spirit and in the power of
[36:43] Elijah if you understand that say
[36:46] amen and then we see Elijah comes the
[36:49] fourth
[36:50] time you see the fourth time now is is
[36:54] coming to the
[36:55] Gentiles
[36:58] and we notice that this was William
[37:01] Bram now I trust that all of you believe
[37:05] that some of you don't believe that
[37:07] William Bram was the fourth
[37:11] Elijah you can have another service to
[37:13] prove that to
[37:15] you but today we want to to also go on
[37:18] that line a little
[37:21] bit to prove to you why William Bram why
[37:25] this age has receiv received
[37:27] William Bram who is actually the
[37:33] fourth and why in the end
[37:36] time so I say that unequivocally without
[37:40] any
[37:42] doubt will Bram was the fourth
[37:46] elah that is without any
[37:49] debate agree with me you can say
[37:52] Amen praise God but that is to the
[37:55] Gentiles
[37:58] we are coming back to that just hold
[38:01] that for a moment and then we notice
[38:03] that the fifth time Elijah
[38:05] comes he comes now to the
[38:09] Jews and in Revelation
[38:12] 11 the Bible speaks of two
[38:15] witnesses it says that one of them had
[38:18] the power to turn water into
[38:23] blood that is
[38:25] Moses other one he had power to call
[38:29] fire from
[38:31] heaven so that is the the ministry of
[38:34] elij so we notice that the Jews will
[38:37] also receive the ministry of Elijah
[38:42] again but that will be after the
[38:48] Rapture therefore that is not our
[38:53] ministry that Ministry is not really
[38:57] about the
[39:00] Gentiles coming after the
[39:03] Rapture the salvation of the 144,000
[39:10] Jews but for now where are we we are
[39:15] right here at the coming of the fourth
[39:19] Elijah now listen to me all the five
[39:22] comings of
[39:25] Elijah really benefit the
[39:28] Jews except for the fourth
[39:32] one William Bram went from
[39:36] America and he was going to go to
[39:39] Israel but do you know what the Holy
[39:41] Spirit stopped
[39:44] him God spoke to him when he was up in
[39:46] the
[39:48] air and told him don't you do
[39:51] that don't you go there why don't you
[39:56] understand
[39:57] that William BR you know you have to go
[39:59] and find that
[40:01] video they interviewed him and they
[40:04] asked him whether he thinks that he his
[40:08] ministry will be received in
[40:12] Israel he believed yes he said yes I
[40:14] believe
[40:15] it he said because the Bible says the
[40:19] the Greeks seek after
[40:21] wisdom and the Jews seek after
[40:24] signs and the min of William Bram was
[40:27] that Anointed with the Min with with the
[40:30] spirit of
[40:33] Elijah do signs and wonders to call fire
[40:37] from heaven to show the sign of the
[40:40] Messiah if if he went to
[40:43] Israel their eyes would have
[40:46] opened they would have understood the
[40:49] Messiah and it was not yet
[40:53] time for them to receive the Messiah the
[40:56] time of the
[40:58] Gentiles was not yet finished so God did
[41:02] not allow him to go
[41:04] there there would come another man who
[41:07] would have the same
[41:09] anointing like
[41:11] Elijah John like Willam and he would go
[41:15] to the
[41:17] Jews but that would be after the Rapture
[41:20] of the
[41:23] Gentile so God stopped him told him you
[41:26] cannot go there it is not yet
[41:31] time praise God so only the fourth
[41:36] Elijah came to the Jew the
[41:39] Gentiles everything about the Jews is
[41:43] known everything about the Jews is
[41:46] numbered so much that we even know how
[41:49] many will be saved among the
[41:52] Jews but for the Gentiles it is to by
[41:58] Grace by grace and grace
[42:01] alone God is dealing with us as
[42:05] individuals Ephesians
[42:08] 2:8 it says for by grace are ye saved
[42:11] through
[42:14] faith amen tell somebody we are saved by
[42:18] grace we are saved by grace in Romans
[42:22] 11:
[42:24] 24 amen I'm sorry I have a limited time
[42:28] here and so I'm going a little
[42:30] faster so you have to think
[42:33] quick follow follow these details
[42:36] now and so Romans
[42:38] 11:24 it says for if thou call cut out
[42:42] of the Olive
[42:43] Tree which is Wild by
[42:49] nature and you were graft contrary to
[42:52] Nature into a good olive
[42:55] tree
[42:59] to
[43:02] Nature how much more shall
[43:05] these which be the natural
[43:09] branches be crafted into their own Olive
[43:14] Tree follow me closely here God intends
[43:17] to cut off the
[43:20] Gentiles God intends to do
[43:24] it God intends to cut off the Gentiles
[43:26] and return to the
[43:29] Jews but first the times of the Gentiles
[43:34] must be
[43:37] fulfilled for he said you were saved by
[43:41] grace the Gentiles you came in by
[43:44] grace and he said you were the Wild
[43:47] Olive
[43:50] Branch you were removed from the
[43:54] world and you were you know wrote onto
[43:56] this Olive
[43:58] Tree and the original branch of the
[44:01] Olive
[44:03] Tree was cut off and then you you were
[44:07] grafted
[44:08] on says he asks a question then if God
[44:13] can take a wild
[44:15] branch and it onto the Olive
[44:19] Tree how much
[44:21] more those who were the
[44:24] original how easy will it be for
[44:28] him to bring it back and graft them
[44:31] again let me tell you Israel is the
[44:35] original
[44:37] Church the gospel came to them
[44:40] first but because they rejected it they
[44:44] were
[44:45] blinded for your sake that you may
[44:48] receive the
[44:49] Gospel you were grafted on by Grace not
[44:54] of your works
[44:56] that you can boast of
[44:58] it hallelujah hallelujah that is why I
[45:01] cannot understand anyone who preaches
[45:04] the gospel of
[45:07] works because the gospel among the
[45:11] Gentiles is a message of
[45:14] Grace amen we have been grafted
[45:17] on by Grace but remember not
[45:23] permanently up to some time
[45:27] when the
[45:29] fullness of the Gentiles has
[45:32] come then we shall be cut again and then
[45:36] Jesus will go back to the original
[45:40] Branch Israel and graft them back on
[45:45] again okay let me interpret it what he
[45:49] is saying that the Jews right now don't
[45:53] believe Jesus because their eyes were
[45:57] blinded so that God can now call the
[46:00] Gentile
[46:02] bride when the last Gentile bride has
[46:05] come
[46:06] in it is time for Jesus now to go back
[46:10] again to the
[46:12] Jews the Gentiles will be left in their
[46:16] denominations in their and
[46:18] dogmas will go to the
[46:21] Jews so he says now I want you to follow
[46:23] me closely
[46:24] here
[46:27] 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you
[46:30] should be ignorant of this mystery lest
[46:32] you should be wise in your own Concepts
[46:34] that blindness in part is happened to
[46:37] Israel until the fullness of the
[46:40] Gentiles become
[46:54] in
[47:04] praise God praise God so there is a Time
[47:08] coming and here it is when the fullness
[47:12] of the Gentiles has
[47:15] coming how long or when will it come
[47:19] in please listen to me the fullness of
[47:22] the
[47:24] Gentiles in by seven Church
[47:29] ages from epes
[47:34] to that is the time of the
[47:37] Gentiles from
[47:39] Ephesus Jesus is beginning to call his
[47:45] bride he continues calling his
[47:48] bride up
[47:51] to Revelation 1 verse
[47:54] 10
[47:56] I was in the spirit of the Lord's
[47:58] day and I had behind me a great
[48:02] voice as of a
[48:05] trumpet saying I am Alpha and
[48:08] Omega the first and the
[48:11] last what thou
[48:14] seest write in a book and send it unto
[48:17] the seven
[48:19] churches which are in
[48:21] Asia now this is John
[48:24] seeing his visions and the Bible says he
[48:28] actually gives a testimony that he was
[48:29] in the spirit of the Lord
[48:34] is the Lord this day I told you is the
[48:36] day of the Holy
[48:39] Ghost when you receive the Holy Ghost
[48:41] you are in the Lord in
[48:44] the when you receive the Holy Spirit you
[48:46] have received your
[48:49] Sabbath if you understand it say
[48:51] Amen so now he says here I you know I am
[48:55] Alpha and
[48:57] Omega what you see right in a book and
[48:59] send it to the seven
[49:00] [Applause]
[49:03] churches and he says these churches are
[49:07] where in
[49:09] Asia Asia is the Gentile
[49:13] land not
[49:15] Israel so these are gentle
[49:18] churches the first one is ephes the
[49:22] second one is the third is PG
[49:28] [Music]
[49:31] and and he continues on and
[49:35] verse where where he speaks of the
[49:37] mystery of the candlesticks and the
[49:39] Mystery of the
[49:45] stars please follow me Clos verse 12 he
[49:49] says and I turned to see the voice that
[49:50] spake with
[49:53] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[50:00] candlesticks and now this is John
[50:02] turning
[50:04] and he wanted to see the voice that
[50:06] spoke with
[50:07] him and he saw seven golden
[50:11] candlesticks and in the mid of the of
[50:14] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[50:16] son of
[50:19] man closed with a gar down to the
[50:23] foot and got about the PS with
[50:30] all right now his head his head and his
[50:33] ears were white like
[50:37] wool as white as
[50:40] snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[50:44] fire and his feet like the fine like
[50:46] unto fine
[50:50] brass and if they bur in a
[50:53] furnace as if they Bur in a
[50:57] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[51:00] many
[51:02] Waters and he had in his right
[51:05] [Music]
[51:06] hand Seven
[51:09] Stars tell your neighbor Seven
[51:11] Stars and out of his mouth went that
[51:15] sharp two-edged
[51:17] sword and his contance was as the sun
[51:20] shineth in his
[51:23] strength so when he turned
[51:26] he saw seven golden
[51:30] candles and he also
[51:33] saw amen one that was in the middle of
[51:36] the seven golden
[51:39] C like a son of
[51:42] man and then he also saw in his right
[51:46] hand there was seven
[51:49] stars all right so we coming we are
[51:51] seeing s
[51:54] S7 began with
[51:56] Elisha Elisha prayed stretch himself
[51:59] over the
[52:01] child and the child sneezed how many
[52:05] times seven times so we coming down to
[52:09] find the seven Gentile
[52:13] dispensation which is the time of the
[52:17] Gentiles and it comes in its fullness
[52:20] after the seventh Church
[52:24] a
[52:27] but we cannot understand
[52:29] that until we see the vision of
[52:33] John John saw the Gentile
[52:37] Church John saw the the Gentile church
[52:40] as a seven
[52:42] candles so the seven
[52:45] Candlestick was the fullness of the
[52:48] gentille listen after the
[52:52] candlesticks then comes Israel again
[52:56] right before the candlesticks is
[53:00] Israel after the candlesticks is
[53:04] Israel so now we are seeing the
[53:06] candlesticks in the middle
[53:08] there so in your mind you can draw the
[53:11] the Star of David here and the Star of
[53:12] David here and the candlesticks in the
[53:20] middle are you following me now but yet
[53:23] in the middle of the candle
[53:26] there were seven there was
[53:29] one who was like the son of
[53:31] man and in his hand there were seven
[53:37] stars what does it mean every Church
[53:41] age had a star every church had a star
[53:47] but those stars were in the hands of
[53:51] God it was in the hands of Jesus amen
[53:55] they weren't on their on their
[53:59] own they were in the hands of him him
[54:03] that is Alpha and
[54:04] Omega him that is the beginning and the
[54:07] end these Stars don't have their own
[54:11] message these STS don't have their own
[54:14] life remember the
[54:17] son that was in the middle of the of the
[54:21] candles is the one who has the light
[54:26] the stars reflect the light of the
[54:30] sun are you following me the Stars don't
[54:35] have their own
[54:36] light the stars reflect the sign the
[54:39] light of the
[54:42] sun well here is talking of the s o n
[54:45] but we know it can it might as well be
[54:47] the
[54:50] S praise God because they they were
[54:53] reflecting the s o n light
[54:55] [Music]
[54:59] the Son of
[55:03] God so what does the candlesticks
[55:07] mean what does the stars
[55:09] mean Revelation
[55:12] 117 and when I saw him I fell at his
[55:15] feet as
[55:17] death and he and he laid his right hand
[55:20] upon
[55:21] me saying unto me fear not I am the
[55:26] first and I am the last I am he that
[55:30] liveth and was dead hallelujah oh I'm so
[55:35] glad to serve he that is
[55:38] alive he does not say I am he that is
[55:41] dead who was
[55:44] alive but he's saying I am he that
[55:47] live I am he that was dead and is alive
[55:53] I want to say Jesus is Alive and
[55:56] he's alive in his church he's alive in
[55:59] his
[56:00] bride churches out there are praying for
[56:04] Revival but we are in the bride's
[56:07] Revival we are waiting for Brother
[56:10] CH our Revival is
[56:13] here amen our Revival am is the message
[56:18] of the amen that comes by the power of
[56:21] the Holy
[56:23] Ghost change our
[56:25] bodies one of these
[56:28] morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[56:31] we will wake up to the
[56:37] resurrection I'm he that was dead and
[56:40] behold I am alive
[56:42] forever amen and I have the keys of hell
[56:48] and he has the
[56:50] keys Hallelujah tell your neighbor he
[56:54] has the keys
[56:56] he the KE he has the keing oh my
[57:01] good write the things which thou has
[57:04] seen and the things which are and the
[57:08] things which shall be
[57:10] here mystery of the Seven
[57:13] Stars which you have seen in my right
[57:17] hand and the Seven golden
[57:20] kind the seven stars are the Angels
[57:26] tell your neighbor the Seven Stars are
[57:27] the
[57:29] Angels of the seven
[57:33] churches and the Seven
[57:35] candlesticks which you have seen at the
[57:38] seven
[57:40] churches how many churches does Jesus
[57:44] have he has only one
[57:46] Church which is said upon this
[57:48] revelation of the
[57:50] world upon this revelation of who I
[57:53] am I will build my
[57:56] church and the GS of Hell shall not
[57:58] Prevail
[58:00] against the Church of Jesus Christ is
[58:03] built upon the
[58:05] revelation of Jesus
[58:08] Christ and and and this is the same
[58:12] church that has been in all the church
[58:15] all the Seven
[58:17] Ages when he says seven
[58:20] churches it is just symbolic to Seven
[58:23] Ages so the gentle Church
[58:27] therefore is alloted in a period of
[58:30] Seven
[58:34] Ages 1 2 3 4 five six
[58:39] seven how many times remember in the
[58:41] child
[58:44] sneeze seven times we are coming back to
[58:48] that epes what was it meaning they aimed
[58:53] that and then relax
[58:57] you know you know was the
[59:00] beginning they had the anointing of a
[59:03] lion and they had the truth the purity
[59:06] of the
[59:07] word and then somewhere they began to
[59:11] relax is simply you know it simply talks
[59:15] about two
[59:16] things death and
[59:19] bitterness you know and you know the as
[59:22] the church started now to receive
[59:24] persecution
[59:27] and you know means
[59:29] married the church now married
[59:32] [Music]
[59:34] state became
[59:40] one the church and the politics
[59:44] married and there that was the beginning
[59:47] of the Roman Catholic Church
[59:52] movement but remember in each of of
[59:54] these
[59:56] ages God had a star
[1:00:00] Messer that kept the light
[1:00:04] shining it might have been a little
[1:00:07] light but it was shining
[1:00:10] any it kept life
[1:00:13] in and then come after
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:17] p means the dominating
[1:00:21] female that is when the doct of the
[1:00:24] trity the
[1:00:27] whole now almost the truth was
[1:00:31] lost God had a little
[1:00:34] light God had a little light in
[1:00:38] that praise
[1:00:40] God hallelujah hallelujah oh my I wish I
[1:00:43] go in the
[1:00:44] details come
[1:00:47] s you know s means the escaped
[1:00:51] on why because this was the era or the
[1:00:56] age of Martin
[1:00:59] Luther protestantism
[1:01:03] started when there was gross
[1:01:06] Darkness covering the Earth amen God had
[1:01:10] his little
[1:01:12] star Martin
[1:01:14] Luther came and he began to
[1:01:17] Shine the Light of the
[1:01:20] World by preaching they just shall live
[1:01:23] by fa
[1:01:27] alone you know he
[1:01:29] escaped the false Church
[1:01:31] system and began the Reformation
[1:01:36] movement which we call the Protestant
[1:01:40] movement and then comes the 60th Church
[1:01:45] age
[1:01:46] Philadelphia Philadelphia means
[1:01:48] brotherly
[1:01:50] kindness brotherly love this was a
[1:01:53] generation
[1:01:55] where the gospel went all over the
[1:01:58] world and the star of that
[1:02:02] age being a man called John
[1:02:06] Wiley a man who preached love a man who
[1:02:09] preached
[1:02:11] sanctification amen man who preached
[1:02:13] that if you have love for your
[1:02:17] brother you are going to go and give him
[1:02:19] the
[1:02:20] gospel amen a man who preached if you
[1:02:24] you you you have amen Christ in you if
[1:02:28] you're truly justified by faith you must
[1:02:31] truly be
[1:02:33] Sanctified by the word of
[1:02:36] God you know and then after
[1:02:39] Philadelphia then
[1:02:42] comes the Street
[1:02:46] Revival which amen brought a new era of
[1:02:52] Pentecostalism also this was the
[1:02:54] beginning of the last
[1:02:57] age last
[1:03:00] Candlestick are you following me now the
[1:03:03] last
[1:03:06] cand praise God and
[1:03:09] then you know means people's
[1:03:14] rights that's why I say we are
[1:03:16] here we are
[1:03:18] in
[1:03:21] we people's rights Women rights
[1:03:25] children's rights homosexual rights
[1:03:29] everybody's rights this is the time this
[1:03:32] is the last age the seventh age then
[1:03:36] where is the seventh
[1:03:39] star the Seven Star must be
[1:03:43] here oh we are not
[1:03:47] in each Church
[1:03:49] age have a St
[1:03:52] messenger by the grace of God go the
[1:03:55] last one would actually be the Elijah to
[1:03:59] the
[1:04:02] Gentiles Hallelujah I want to say this
[1:04:05] is not a
[1:04:07] coincidence some people like
[1:04:11] Alexander they thought they were
[1:04:14] Elijah but their Ministry did not
[1:04:17] fulfill Elijah ministry as prescribed in
[1:04:21] the
[1:04:23] Bible
[1:04:25] alander
[1:04:27] thought he was going to restore
[1:04:30] righteousness and Hol by building
[1:04:34] cities that are
[1:04:37] holy
[1:04:39] phally what they call Zion city in
[1:04:43] America and he was planning to buy a
[1:04:46] great big piece of land in
[1:04:49] Israel to buy a to build a big Zion City
[1:04:52] there for the Lord
[1:04:55] we found that that's not the
[1:04:58] way that Elijah's Ministry would
[1:05:01] be Elijah's Ministry in the end
[1:05:05] time would restore all
[1:05:08] SE Hallelujah not start some
[1:05:12] religion not start some
[1:05:15] denomination some some or something or
[1:05:18] some
[1:05:21] mement I want to say that's why we
[1:05:23] believe William
[1:05:26] his ministry was that of
[1:05:29] Elijah because it
[1:05:31] fulfilled everything the Bible said
[1:05:36] El God spoke to to William
[1:05:39] BR in
[1:05:41] 1933 when he was baptizing the 17th
[1:05:47] person seven
[1:05:49] again Hallelujah and he spoke to him and
[1:05:53] said out of the pill of
[1:05:56] fire thousands of people were
[1:06:01] there John the
[1:06:04] Baptist was sent for my
[1:06:08] first message will on my
[1:06:13] second God
[1:06:15] himself declared who
[1:06:19] El in the end
[1:06:22] time just like Jesus
[1:06:25] he came and declared that John Was
[1:06:28] Elijah Even in our
[1:06:31] generation Jesus himself through the
[1:06:34] pill of fire declare that William BR was
[1:06:39] the Elijah in
[1:06:41] the praise God then he returned we are
[1:06:45] back to Kings
[1:06:47] now he returned and walked in the
[1:06:50] house to and fro and he stretched
[1:06:53] himself upon the

[1:37:20] to apologize
[1:37:23] to
[1:37:25] uh uh I had forgotten to read to you
[1:37:28] this even now I had
[1:37:30] forgotten we we have we had we were sent
[1:37:34] this uh wedding invitation
[1:37:41] electronically and like I was telling my
[1:37:43] sister that I always disregard
[1:37:45] electronic
[1:37:50] things
[1:37:54] it's just like young people sometimes
[1:37:56] they send me important things on phone
[1:37:59] on
[1:38:03] WhatsApp they ought to have made a call
[1:38:05] or G to a physical
[1:38:09] meeting so I believe we have technology
[1:38:12] but certain things should not be
[1:38:13] replaced by
[1:38:19] technology so we have this wedding
[1:38:23] invitation this is the family uh
[1:38:26] extended family actually of our sister
