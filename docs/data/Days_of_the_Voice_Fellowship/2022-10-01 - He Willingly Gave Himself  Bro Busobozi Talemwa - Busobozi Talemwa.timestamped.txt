[1:40:48] Christ loved the church
[1:40:52] he gave himself
[1:40:56] for the church
[1:41:00] you know when when a man loves his wife
[1:41:03] or massage
[1:41:06] he gives himself
[1:41:09] especially a boy or a man before they uh

[1:41:15] girl
[1:41:18] um
[1:41:20] [Applause]
[1:41:24] because he wants to make his desire
[1:41:27] known
[1:41:30] the God is going on another way
[1:41:34] but the boy is around
[1:41:38] himself

[1:48:09] to you
[1:48:10] God loved us so much that he willingly
[1:48:13] gave himself
[1:48:18] and I will not be long this morning
[1:48:22] I always say that and sometimes I'm
[1:48:24] wrong
[1:48:26] but I hope I will not be wrong
[1:48:29] so if it wasn't for his actions
[1:48:35] we would still be Sinners
[1:48:38] we would still be lost
[1:48:41] we would be unloved we would be hopeless
[1:48:53] but I want to tell you this morning
[1:48:57] and love
[1:48:59] song
[1:49:01] you have no reason of feeling lost
[1:49:06] foreign
[1:50:17] that you said
[1:50:19] we are we all come to the world speaking
[1:50:22] lies
[1:50:25] saved by grace
[1:50:31] and that's why church this morning
[1:50:33] I want us to appreciate they're gonna
[1:50:36] have to see me what the word
[1:50:39] Jesus Christ yes Christian has done for
[1:50:42] us in this house
[1:50:44] he has willingly given himself to us
[1:50:50] you know you're willingly he willingly
[1:50:53] without being forced
[1:52:01] come up here
[1:52:04] come come right
[1:52:05] yes you're wondering I'm not brother
[1:52:07] Adam
[1:52:08] but your brother Adam now
[1:52:10] Adam was in sin
[1:52:12] and he hid himself somewhere
[1:52:21] and Adam was there
[1:52:25] really was hiding his face okay
[1:52:29] and he was having his wife with him
[1:52:33] the brother's wife is still with him
[1:52:37] and he was hiding right there but I want
[1:52:42] to show you what love is
[1:52:45] what Grace is
[1:52:54] and that's why sometimes we preach
[1:52:55] things you think you don't need
[1:52:59] it is
[1:53:04] [Applause]
[1:53:09] only crying and hiding himself
[1:53:13] but when God came
[1:53:15] he began from wherever he was standing
[1:53:18] yeah
[1:53:28] foreign
[1:54:09] you can only seek after a God who has
[1:54:11] already sought after him
[1:54:15] hallelujah amen he sold for us
[1:54:20] give us that stand he says he loved me
[1:54:23] before I knew him
[1:54:26] and all my love is due here
[1:54:31] he plunged me
[1:54:34] to Victory
[1:54:36] the cleansing flowers
[1:54:42] it is his action not ours because
[1:54:49] when I look at myself he said we need to
[1:54:52] know leader I seek insufficient
[1:54:55] I say helplessness because never sitting
[1:54:58] up your army I have broken heart
[1:55:01] um
[1:55:03] but when I look at him
[1:55:06] I can now say
[1:55:09] I know he truly loves me
[1:55:15] he willingly gave himself to become a
[1:55:18] ransom for all yeah and
[1:55:26] the church sometimes has become a
[1:55:28] hindrance
[1:55:32] to
[1:55:34] receive Christ
[1:55:40] when God came down
[1:55:43] and he looked
[1:56:01] so everybody was pointing at somebody
[1:56:05] and sometimes when the Lord comes down
[1:56:07] to reach down your hands
[1:56:11] you begin quitting at some others
[1:56:14] and others Point At You
[1:56:17] they sometimes others behave as if
[1:56:19] they're holier than others
[1:56:23] look at somebody as if they are seen as
[1:56:26] a new you are better than them but
[1:56:37] here today
[1:56:41] who is spiritual
[1:56:46] praise the name of the Lord
[1:56:49] well nobody said I'm spiritual
[1:56:54] but yet during the week you will be
[1:56:58] pointing at somebody that is the
[1:56:59] Cardinal Brothers
[1:57:03] that brother is not even saved
[1:57:06] that brother should even be fired
[1:57:12] because it's not good
[1:57:16] so this morning I want to approach you
[1:57:19] if you have that attitude
[1:57:24] that God gave himself
[1:57:34] we're insufficient priority all of us
[1:57:37] were helpless
[1:57:43] we are sinners all of us couldn't we are
[1:57:47] hell-bounds
[1:57:48] but when he came and he gave himself he
[1:57:53] for us we did not force him ask him but
[1:57:59] why are we here we are not here by
[1:58:01] asking 41. yeah
[1:58:05] you are not here by accident sister 31
[1:58:08] you are not here you are here by Design
[1:58:12] [Applause]
[1:58:13] you are here because God gave himself
[1:58:16] for you
[1:58:17] [Applause]
[1:58:19] and you realized it again oh God has
[1:58:24] given himself for me
[1:58:26] I am a part of him
[1:58:33] you also gave him your heart and I'd
[1:58:37] like you today to give your hand to the
[1:58:38] Lord Jesus
[1:58:41] because he already has given his hand to
[1:58:44] him
[1:58:47] of the two five he says for there is one
[1:58:49] God and one mediator between God and man
[1:58:52] the man in Christ Jesus who gave himself
[1:58:55] for a random for all
[1:59:45] you could say if he was speaking from
[1:59:48] the grave or Moon
[1:59:52] he would say I am the first and the last
[1:59:57] foreign

[2:00:47] he was not a man speaking I didn't even
[2:00:50] try again yes Jesus was a hundred
[2:00:52] percent man
[2:00:55] after he died and rose again
[2:01:01] but now I am alive so this is not a man
[2:01:05] speaking
[2:01:06] this is God this is deity
[2:01:10] man Adam took life and turned it into
[2:01:13] death
[2:01:16] but this man Jesus
[2:01:20] and turned it into life yet

[2:57:58] let us take it line by line God knew
[2:58:01] what he was doing
[2:58:03] when he looked through the blood of the
[2:58:07] illness
[2:58:12] or to the guilty
[2:58:18] that's blood red
[2:58:22] this is
[2:58:28] I want two people to come here
[2:58:32] all right now let one stand right there
[2:58:35] um
[2:58:40] both of you say no no it's all right
[2:58:42] yeah both of you look this side
[2:58:45] look at me okay now here is Jesus oh no
[2:58:50] yes
[2:58:51] the Innocence
[2:58:54] and right there is
[2:59:05] he looks at the scene the the Innocence
[2:59:16] and he sees the sinner
[2:59:20] but he sees him as
[2:59:22] without kids
[2:59:29] for you to be the righteousness if
[2:59:36] Jesus is out of the picture yes
[2:59:45] you see and who is Jesus yes
[2:59:54] you will see your sins and everything
[2:59:56] I've ever done
[3:00:01] without him but when Christ comes in the
[3:00:05] beginning Christopher James and then he
[3:00:09] sees you through him yes
[3:00:18] [Music]
[3:00:34] amen what did Jesus do yes he gave
[3:00:38] himself
[3:00:48] not because you are righteous
[3:00:51] but because you have accepted the
[3:00:54] righteousness of God through Christ
[3:01:06] not because of something that you do
[3:01:08] situation not because of some good deeds
[3:01:12] you do the thing you do the Good Deeds
[3:01:16] because you are a Believer
[3:01:24] trousers because you're a
[3:01:26] Believers
[3:01:30] [Applause]
[3:01:32] your earrings because you're a Believers
[3:01:46] you no longer do the balance things
[3:01:50] and work as if they'll put something in
[3:01:53] your no
[3:02:06] you are
[3:02:12] not together so
[3:02:15] when somebody
[3:02:17] is trying to know Christ
[3:02:18] [Music]
[3:02:21] some of you approach it wrong way
[3:02:24] [Music]
[3:02:26] you approach it the wrong way
[3:02:28] you approach them the wrong way
[3:02:33] can you imagine see what you are doing
[3:02:38] no even you've got to come to our church
[3:02:59] why watch
[3:03:01] why what
[3:03:03] because when you have no Revelation
[3:03:06] yourself foreign
[3:03:32] but when they have never believed
[3:03:34] our brothers who have no Holy Spirit
[3:03:39] [Music]
[3:03:41] both of you have no Holy Spirit
[3:03:45] but if you had the Holy Spirit you would
[3:03:48] look beyond what you see one is
[3:04:03] do they have these things
[3:04:13] what makes them happy
[3:04:14] movies of the words
[3:04:20] what makes them happy songs
[3:04:26] so it's not the words that save you at
[3:04:28] all
[3:04:30] some good things that make you righteous
[3:04:34] you do the good things because you are a
[3:04:37] Believers
[3:04:39] that doesn't do sorry but that isn't
[3:04:43] what it does
[3:04:45] and that isn't what does it
[3:04:49] but that doesn't do it by Good Deeds
[3:04:54] joining church is all right
[3:04:57] and that isn't what does it that has it
[3:05:01] that isn't what does it
[3:05:03] it's when you recognize that you are a
[3:05:06] sinner
[3:05:10] you are lost the only way that God can
[3:05:14] see you righteous is through the blood
[3:05:17] of Jesus
[3:05:22] and when it sees you through the blood
[3:05:24] of Jesus
[3:05:26] is you as innocent as his own son
[3:05:33] that's the gospel story friends
[3:05:53] hallelujah hallelujah
