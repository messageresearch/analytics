much to us we have come with one desire this morning that we shall see you will have fellowship with you we shall rejoice that has come this morning and those that are streaming with us and those that shall see this service will excite us this morning amen [Music] why don't you greet your neighbor tell them God bless you um thank you brother are you ready before we see it before we see it another true naturally we need um I just wanted to give you as you are just still standing because I'd like us to sing A Chorus as we are passing the offering back if the brothers can make it ready our youth meetings are here actually they are here so this coming Sunday Sunday we are having our youth meetings on Friday services and this I told you these are our meetings is going to come in and others will also participate but we are the ones hosting these meetings [Music] I don't know about you but for me I'm excited about it amen so the young people in this church I would like you to be to Avail yourself from Thursday and try and ask around whatever you can do suppose many other brothers [Music] these brothers ask them where can I be of help meanwhile we need the fans against CB you know if I think we have prepared these meetings in just uh four weeks or three less than that and uh it it looks like it is going to be more than we expected so [Music] a little time for us to be able to raise funds but our God is a Jehovah [Music] you can actually provide through us if you don't give someone else and if someone else gives the blessing we'll go to them amen so we've only pledged two millions 99 000. and not all of it a little of that is a fraction of that is pain so uh we we believe that the Lord will provide uh why don't the brothers move the offering back if you want to give something towards those youth meetings [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh how sweet to walk in this liquor [Music] days [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'd like to feel [Music] with my love to me [Music] said oh yes [Music] while we are standing shall return to the Book of John image how many came expecting to hear the words amen that's the uh the main service you see whatever we do in the in a church is good but the most important thing when we go to church is the preaching of the words everything you know is to what's that so let us read uh chapter one of John yokana verses 10 to 13. everybody there if you're there say Amen foreign was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave him power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which we are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God foreign [Music] foreign Amen Let us speak to him Lord Jesus we want to give this service now back to you could not be seen But when you be seen at this moment we need you Lord just come and speak to us in Jesus name amen can I have a little more sound brothers so this morning I'm speaking on the generation of Overcomers the generation of overcast amen Mina I don't know whether you believe you are a part of that generation but I believe I am a part of that generation as a matter of fact this is going to be our theme for the Youth meetings and I am really looking forward to the youth meetings I believe we shall have a marvelous time amen amen now John says that Jesus or Christ was in the world but the world was made by him yes imagine he is the one that made the world and the world he came to the world that he met but the world knew him not whatever is [Music] so some people actually say they have failed to believe because of the church where they attended I've even found people in the message comparing preacher to preacher sounds comparing churches to churches where you can do that but I don't really believe in that because I believe that as long as the word of God is being preached if you don't change the problem is not the preacher's problem the problem is yours last time we talked about the pattern of every true Ministries and we noticed that I don't want to go back into that but if you want you can go back and listen to it so as long as you are safe a true God Living Ministries because a true Minister will be true to the world he will never deviate from the world he will never bring or bridge to you something else other than what the word says will always yield himself the spirit amen a true Minister will not be sent by man but he will be sent by God as long as you are sitting under a true Ministry it's not about the stature of a man it's not about the ability of the man it's not even about how many people attend at the church where you go how much things whether you have a full band or you have nothing foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] then we also had some brothers they tried to devise some means of getting some musical instruments so they went to this old uh metallic bottles put some holes in it put some Stones [Music] that's where we were changed in such Services that's where we met God [Music] and I want to encourage you tonight but as long as you are sitting under the true word of God God will always meet you there and you must always overcome regardless of what you're fighting since Jesus was God yes and God came in the world that he himself had created but the world did not know him the Bible says he came to his own Bible but his own received him so in other words whenever you come to a service you know the Lord is coming to speak to you listen this is not me that you know or the brother to know that is speaking to you from this time we give the service to him and we have asked him to come and speak to us so we believe is now at this time speaking to us through his words how many will receive him receive him in our generation [Music] foreign gone by God doesn't give birth but here the Bible says otherwise the Bible says as many as received Jesus Christ how many have received him here the Bible says he has given you the right be a Son of God someone says God has no children I will tell them your son left look at me even to them that believe in his name is are born by our mothers our fathers they never even ever said that was the that was a blood now because the will of a man tells according to the last of the flesh for us to be born again foreign foreign [Music] because he died for all we know that he died for all but to those that he received that receive him he gave them a promise of adoption one of those who received him he gave them power to be the sons of God when he receive him you have promises from him listen to this when he receive him the moment he receive him he gives you promises that will never failure how can we fail to our a promise that he has given me because of receiving him then I know that I am going to be a part of the Overcomers I'm gonna take a quote here and then we'll we'll go to study a little bit of what happened in the desert I want us to look at this brother says and remember that the reproach of the word the word has always bore a reproach all through the edges God is Anointed words you are going to be reproached [Applause] what this is let me begin that way to live as a Christian if you don't understand what is but if you understand what is in here to be a Christian you will not be an effort on your part of Christ will not fight to overcome because you will know that is one that has overcome for you and say here is where I stand on the world then you will know that the promises of the word must always apply to a Believer who has taken his turn I'm going to show you example today so I wanted to follow me here would be very hard to live a Christian Life foreign foreign [Music] but a married woman she has no need to fear reproach because to why it is not reproached because the Bible says when they reproach you for the sake of Christ blessed are you hallelujah amen when you become pregnant and you are married you'll even take pictures and everybody will be happy and no one will look at you as a bad woman everybody will look at you as a blessed woman and the Bible says the fruit of the womb is your reward so in the sun somewhere why the people fear the reproach of Christ through our children because they don't understand Christ is to them but only if you can understand Christ is your life is the word of God is everything you need everything you need is in the word of God if you can understand that you want fear to be reproached because you believe the world will you stand for what the word says fight to your other friends about Christ and when they don't accept him you won't feel ashamed hallelujah amen because you know thank God man you are ready to take the reproach of Christ universe listen you always have to stand this reproach in order to give your testing every man that comes to Christ for the purpose that God has ordained you foreign there is a purpose God has ordained for you again praise the name of the Lord you know the husband just brought me to you right now do you think there is a purpose of God has ordained you foreign [Music] sincerely if that is what life is to you you've lost it you don't have purpose every child of God has a purpose and remember if you can just keep quiet remember if he has called you for this foreign you know I was I was 13 about exactly 15 when I found out when I found my life's purpose and when I found my life's purpose nothing mattered challenge whatever I decided to do was going to help me achieve my life's purpose we need to make in our life connections we need to cut off from ourselves because we have found our lives [Music] purpose needed to force him to leave his people because had found his life's purpose and when it dawned on him that he had to let Lord go and that was because he realized Lord was hindering him from achieving his life's purpose you see if you don't know your life you are as a cow without a driver you are you don't know where you are going you are playing that is like an autopilot and you don't know where you are going anytime you might you know might hit something anytime you might you know have an accident let me tell you especially the younger generation the younger people you know you need to realize your life's purpose because you know you're being reproached because of Christ or a crystal Christ will give you your life's purpose this word is meant to give us our lives hallelujah amen listen then He says every man that comes to Christopher is ordained for a purpose remember if he has called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening Hallelujah I mean there are things that God has purpose for us to achieve in this life but also there is a main purpose all of us the real purpose of this message that is my life's purpose that is it is people especially in politics and other rooms of Life they will do anything for their greater purpose and that's all right we as Believers we also have a greater purpose are you ready to do anything for that purpose [Music] but I'm talking about cutting them out of your life if if it will call you to to do some rational decisions if it will make you to be misunderstood [Music] because you must your purpose is only on one thing the coming of the Lord nothing is going to hinder there's one sister's brother who sang a song he says there I want nothing [Music] it makes no difference [Music] whether it means that you are going to be the poorest of the poor or that's it again and it will take that for you to go wherever it means you have to be the richest of the richest from everything else let us have that purpose of lives here I'm going to make it I'm going to go to the road foreign another purpose Hallelujah I mean nothing is going to stop it from happening brother Fred God has called me to be an overcome afraid to overcome loudest in Temptations The Temptations God has told me for this amen and I'm going to say it until my body learns to believe it I'm going to say it until it happens in my life you must say that it happens in your life I'm going to live above sin in the time to live above the pride of life Hallelujah you are born for a purpose and nobody can take your place hallelujah amen we talk of Gideon but they could take their place come on speak your name let us talk of your name hallelujah amen foreign let us draw from him [Music] let us draw from him you know God doesn't want children who don't draw from him [Music] he calls himself the breasted one cartoon calls himself the blessing Hallelujah you know a child must sucker we are suckering right now so when you are suckering you have to show that indeed you are receiving [Music] hallelujah amen amen whether the devil loves it or not when a child of God begins to sucker foreign it happened to uh to Sarai is she became young again and do you know what she used that strength foreign [Applause] [Music] God is word will Triumph it cannot fail but she is a limited one there is where every Christian ought to Stars knowing that and trials will come and see him everywhere to you but remember God has a purpose and it all will work right hallelujah hallelujah at this time I'd like us to look at somebody some people who were a generation of overcomes [Music] open with meaning in your Bible to the Book of Numbers versus two foreign and um it's all good but we can read from verses 17. this is where Moses Musa according to the instruction of God he sent out spies amen amen and let us read together let us read verse by verse I mean and Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and say done to them get you up this way Southward and go up into the mountains and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many foreign [Music] whether there be water in or not and be of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the first striped grips so they went up and searched the land from the Wilderness of sin until men come to hamath and they ascended by the south and came unto Hebron where are human and they tell Maya they should not wear now Hebron was built seven years before Zone in Egypt a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs [Music] the place was called The Brook of escort because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut from down from themselves for a Time Moses their prophet had given them the message and the message was God has sent me to take you to a land I'm going with milk and honey you will love it all you young men and young ladies and all the ones thanking all of you my name is you know how it was there and you know God stood with them because they were with the prophet and they reached a place called um this uh the the one that I just Kadesh never to come fetch it was and at this time God told Moses tell these people to choose among themselves [Music] America 12. let them send these people to Canada and let them spy out the land bucket take in Sea and so they went to Canaan never again and spied out the land the market and see and as they were going we found that now they reached and they they were able to get some because Moses had told them be of Guru College get something from some something from there a fruit or something go and come back and tell us because I know what God told me is true the land is good and synonyms and so when they went back in that verse 25 says and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to iron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel and to the Wilderness apparent to parent unto kaddish and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land is always true always true but usually what God does he stands here at the beginning of your life here is where I'm taking you it's perfect that's what God does he doesn't tell you the process and many of us are excited become a Christian even they got a song I don't sing that song because you you don't just flow you are not just flowing to heaven then I'm good you are going through battles it's not easy since the Christian life is not easy you have to take a stand and here you promised them that you are going over to a land sit flowing with milk and honey please be of courage take some fruits and bring them to us I don't know how they went there because they were spies they have to make themselves look like spies they had to go in a very subtle way they will not be understood their mission but when they arrived they found the fruits everything God had said it was true but there was something foreign they are strong and the city is a world and moreover we saw the children in the land of the South they dwell in the mountains [Music] we are not able who said we are not able to days of the voice Fellowship days of the Voice who said we are not able and yeah because we are few Quran actually numbers we need to buy our church [Music] even if we found that money tonight [Music] [Music] [Music] there are others who talk like this we are not able they were fearful and the Bible says and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched they brought an evil report to the children of Israel they said they landed through which we have gone to search to search it is a land that eats up the inhabitants thereof bergamotions someone May Scare You to achieve your life's purpose the journey I have started in my life foreign [Music] hallelujah amen as long as you know customers because you are a generation that is not going to face hallelujah amen amen and while I preach to you I'm preaching to myself this morning and they are so we saw giants the sons of anarch which come of the Giants and we're in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their side the majority of this spies fear to go to possess the land foreign you must overcome they looked at the impossibilities ahead of them they looked at how strong and fierce their enemy was they removed their eyes from the God but I said there was another generation there was a generation of Overcomers women men who did not fear hallelujah amen who were ready to look at their amen their enemies face to face and to tell them God says hallelujah amen you'll read verse 30 and see what I'm talking amen oh my God you have another Caribbean this morning hallelujah amen everything the others were saying it was making people those that was ready to stop hallelujah amen and he told all of them please shut up he told all the friends of jobs please if you may shut up and let me speak let me tell you if you're a part of a generation of Overcomers you don't fear nonsense amen you don't fear your enemies foreign let us go again tell them you can do this hallelujah amen oh my if your business is fading I'm telling you you shall overcome you have a problem and he said before we are well able to overcome it twins we are able to overcome it I also say we are able to overcome I love Joshua yeah I say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let us give him a clap of praise [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and as we bring it to a climax here I'd like us to look at Joshua chapter 14. stand there with me again yeah verse 6. then the children of Jordan Judah came out to Joshua and Giga and he carried the son of Jeffrey the Kennedy said unto him thou knows the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh banaya yes [Music] 40 years old was I when mothers the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh banaya to Aspire other land and I brought him word again as it was my in my heart is nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melts but I wholly followed the Lord my God um I mean did you hear that all the others made everybody that melted but as for me I have four I've wholly followed the Lord my God [Music] how many here are going to have such a testimony and mother swear on that day saying surely the land we're on thy feet have thrown and shall be thine inheritance and thy children is forever because thou has already followed the Lord my God is and now how can that the Lord has kept me alive at this time they are in the promised lands and at this time they want to begin possessing every inch of the land for the cartoon you can see and Caleb remembered he is not giving his testimony the Lord has kept me alive these fourth and five years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses and now low I am in this day for school and five years old okay that was 45 years later the children of Israeli spent a generation in the desert did you know says that all the other people died all of them but never offer because they murmured and they didn't believe the world we are the only ones survived of the other older generation because the holy believe the world and now that they were in the promised land 45 years later friends can't you see this says 40 is a generation this was a new generation the other one died out died this is a new generation and just call it stood before and say you remember how I was faithful you remember how I believe the whole world when everybody was making the children of Israel to shake and to fear you remember you remember I gave a testimony and I told everybody that the Lord is good I told you that we are more than able to take the land name again do you remember why was he telling him these things this was a time Hallelujah the battles we are now it was time Joshua for Joshua to calebra was giving a testimony I am as strong as I was there I am still able to fight everybody else died but why did they die they died because of unbelief let me tell you if you don't believe the word you will die spiritually where the rest are progressing [Music] you progress spiritually you also progress physically now we're getting a message are you hearing me when you progress spiritually even spiritual physically progressed because of unbelief he remained alive and he was able to fight around 45 years later he told them verses and as yet I am strong as this day as I was in the day that mother sent me as my strength was then if you are in Christ you don't become any less strong even so is my strength now both to go out and come in if you ever received any portion of the Holy ghosts Hallelujah will be the same today because the Holy Spirit does not grow old the Holy Spirit grow stronger and stronger and stronger your desire for the word of God and the things and as we are coming to a close tonight I want to finish this scripture and read your quotes after he has given all his testimony this man I don't know how he was looking maybe he was shot such men are usually shot I don't know oh yeah because like Paul Paul was a short man and imagining him like that face and he's giving his testimony even when everybody and everybody made the children 45 years later I am alive and as strong as I was there and then he said something else now there are far cutting all the way to give me this mountain where of the Lord speaking that day hardest in that day how the anakims were there and the cities were great Advanced if so be the Lord will will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord say I mean please listen those people we are still there the anakins this boy this man here um he had seen them 40 years later ago 45 years everybody was shaking because of them but for him he said let us go at once together and possessed give me this mountain my enemies are there but give me this mountain foreign are you going to negotiate with them are you going to run away from them you will die if you do face your enemies give me my mountain give me my mountain and Joshua blessed to him and given to Caleb the son of Jeffy Hebron foreign [Music] [Music] you remember the scripture we began with a challenge for as many as received him again he gave them power he gave them the right to become the sons and I say you have your god-given rights healing is not God given right Holiness it is we shall claim wealth to Japanese no people rise in the name of the Lord claim your god-given privilege and he says to glorify God and to receive the spirit and His blessings his age and the message expectations I'll conclude
