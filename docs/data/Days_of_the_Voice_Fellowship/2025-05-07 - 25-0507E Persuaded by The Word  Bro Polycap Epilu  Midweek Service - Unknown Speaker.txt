Maybe let's first read before uh we are going to read from the book of Hebrews. Hebrews chapter 11 from verse 11- 16. Can I read? Amen. Um it says through faith also Sarah offered uh through faith also Sarah received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised. Therefore sprung up even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand, which is by the seashore innumerable. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. They seek a country. And truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire better country that is unheavenly. Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. And heath prepared for them a city. Amen. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! [Music] [Music] Fore! Foreign! Foreign! [Music] for a singer. [Music] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Uh I just this is what I wanted to say before I read. I would like to I'd like to thank pastor in his absence for giving me this opportunity. to stand before you today. I'm not the best and maybe I'll not be the right person to stand here, but I just thank God for his grace that he has allowed me to stand here. Uh so today I'm going to call my sermon uh persuaded by the word. Being persuaded being being persuaded means to be convinced. It means to be convinced or to be one over. Yeah. So when I say persuaded by the word, I mean being warned by the word, being taken over by the word. When when I look back at these verses I have read. These are very solid verses whereby when you read them, you can never exhaust them because they have a really big I feel they have something really big within them. uh maybe highlight. I wanted to highlight verse 30. And then it says, "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them, and have embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on [Music] earth. Amen. And then verse uh verse 15 it says and truly if they had been mindful of that country from when they came back they might have had opportunity to have returned. I mean that's why I I I chose that that title persuaded by the word because these people they they were really persuaded and confessed to be strangers on this earth. As I said being persuaded means to be one over or ought to be convinced. Maybe someone introduces a new idea to you and then you buy it. A completely new idea. Either I've convinced you by my words or by anything but most times it's a very new idea and then persuaded by the word. So I asked myself what is the word? What is this word which can persuade people? What is this word which can make people lose their minds and say they are strangers on this earth? Do you notice? Do you notice that that is a very big thing? You know someone telling you that you are seed of God and in yourself maybe you don't feel it. Someone tells you this is not where I'm supposed to be. There is somewhere we are going but it never looks like we on a journey because we are ever stationary sometimes. And some people even maybe they had faith that Jesus would return sometime back but they see they are so stagnant. What kind of word is this which can touch someone's heart which can change their lives completely which can change the way they act which can change what they desire which can change everything about their lives. I believe each of us when we look at our lives maybe when we look back we have changed completely and if you haven't changed then you have to look back at the word you're following I I wanted to bring it to this uh in Mark 4:20 I wish you could open to uh Mark [Music] 4:20 I'm going to read only one verse and it says and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruits some 30folds some 60 and some 100 So here this is a parable of the ser who went out to sow. And so when he went out to sow, he saw on different grounds. But there was a ground where he sowed. He saw the seed and it produced some 34, some 64. which means there were fruits. There were fruits out of this ground. And and and when this parable is explained, that seed was the word. And then the good ground were the good the hearts, the hearts which could receive the which could receive the word. And then in in John chapter 1 verse one, we all know that scripture. It says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was then how the word became flesh and so we can see that the word at this point was a person. The word is a person which came down and dwelt among the people. Can you imagine staying with the word something which has to change you but you live with it every day and some people couldn't see it but he lived among the people and those he called he changed them and he he gave them new ideas and like Peter [Music] how we told them they would be fishes of men. So then that word which came among us, this word was tried before this man was killed. He had to be tried before many before many judges. Let me [Music] say I like it. I like it what the preacher from South Africa said. He had to be tried and asked many times, "Are you the son of God? Are you the king of the Jews?" Ask him several times. And after all that, you say, "This man has has done nothing [Music] wrong." And then he's asked again and again to find out who exactly is this guy. Satan didn't know the whole plan of God. The whole plan of God is that Jesus had to be proven worthy. He knew that his life was going to go out and that is the life we are living by. So whenever he went there and and and this man would wash his hands and say this man has no fault on him. And actually when you read it closer, you notice that this man would say, "I have no problem with this man, but you kill him." It was so funny. Why would an innocent man be killed? But he had to be killed for us. God God did all that on purpose. So that in our day no man no one can claim that Jesus was guilty because even after proving that he was innocent they said kill him anyhow. So the Bible says in in uh John chapter 12 verse 24 It says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. So this was actually This was Jesus who gave this parable. He was literally saying unless I die, my life can't come into you, unless I am killed because unless that seed fall and and and die, it abideth alone. But now Jesus had to give his life. He had to give his life for the church. And that is the word which comes to someone's heart and someone feels convinced beyond doubt that this is the truth and people give their necks for that word. Hallelujah. Amen. So that is the word. And then why I also say persuaded by the Lord, it means that there are two forces fighting. There are two forces fighting. We we can see that in uh in Galatians 5:1 17 it talks about it talks about how the flesh lusts against the spirit. So these are two things fighting. The spirit lusts after the things of God, but this body laughs for the things of this world. So there's a fight inside every one of us. the world trying to overcome us. And also when the word comes to our hearts, we feel like the word wants to overcome us. But then sometimes people are unstable until they fail to choose where they want to go. They failed to choose what they want to do. Otherwise if everyone was following maybe the voice of the spirit maybe they would have been growing. We can see that most of us were called from very many things which we left when we're in the world and we f we fed our souls on the things of the word and and followed what our bodies were saying and and ignored what our spirits wanted. Even the seeds of God are like that. Even when you want to do good, sometimes most times your body is against you. Brother said that his biggest enemy is William Brandham. Just imagine the prophet himself having such a problem. It is not a mistake that it happens to us also. It happens to every one of us. Even even where I've read from about these people how they saw themselves strangers on this earth, it doesn't mean that maybe their bodies failed or something because the Bible says that they died in faith. They died believing that So I want I want to read a quote here. It's in question and answers. Someone said he said well since uh me received the Holy Spirit. He said there's been two dogs inside of me and one of them is black and one of them is a white dog. He said they urge you all the time. Say they growl and fight at one at one another and say the white dog wants me to do good and the black dog wants me to do bad. So this was a man filled with the Holy Spirit. A man everyone can look up to and say I want to be like that man. But this is the man himself complaining that there's there's like a black and a white dog and they are fighting against each other that is a spirit and a body and then and then and then they asked him well chief which one of them wins the fight. Then he said he said that depends on which chief feeds the most. Then say, "So I think that's a good answer here." So this man is actually maybe he was perplexed. He has the Holy Spirit and but still we see that he needs the word. He needs the word in his life. This word is alive. As I said that Jesus died and and and his life was given to the church that on our own we can't we can't live on our own life. Paul said that he can't depend on his own righteousness because if it was our own righteousness God would have been so unjust to judge Cain. You can imagine that uh brother Brandham said that Kane was a religious man. Yeah. But uh just because he didn't have a revelation of the word and so he offered a a wrong sacrifice. So uh here I want to I want to uh show you a few men who who are actually persuaded by the word. Uh one of them is Job. Uh we are going to read in Job chapter 19. As we know, Job was one who was really tried. Job was tried in thick and thin. You know, one time the devil was moving on earth and then and then uh and then he goes back before God and God asked him, "Have you seen my servant?" Let's read that in Job chapter 19. Actually, that is in is in some other scripture. I just want to In Job chapter 19, I shall read from verse 25. It says that for I know that my redeemer liveth and he shall stand at the last at the latter day upon the earth. [Music] And after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. So Job was one who has really tried in everything. But the devil goes before God and tells God that Job is just righteous because of what God has given [Music] him. But we can see there's a difference in in in Job's life. Job was one who was convinced. You know in the first in the first verse we read it says that those people died even without receiving the promise. Which means that these people are most likely either poor or maybe they didn't have anything [Music] much. But there was something in their hearts which had life. There was a hope in their hearts. The Bible talks about those who don't have Christ, they literally don't have hope because what can they hope in? They have nothing to hope in. So the devil thought maybe Job was like one of them since God has given him all these things. Maybe he has decided to trust in God. And then the devil comes one by one sweeping everything away. And that is what Satan does in our lives. Many times we go through hard trials and and we think God has left us. Sometimes Satan wants to prove by himself that these are actually children of God. Because being a child of God is not only about coming to church. It's about the life which you have in you. What life do you live when you go out? What life do you live in your home? When someone enters your home, can they see Christ without talking to anyone? You know, there's an atmosphere which is created around the children of God. that you can walk into a place and walk out. You'll notice that there's something different in there. You can talk to someone and mess with them and be like, "This person is different." Sometimes the devil wants to prove that by himself. So Satan comes to Job and he takes away everything he had, every hope he had, every happiness. You know, Job had no fault before God. Job was righteous. Even God would bear a testimony of him. In addition to being righteous, he used to sacrifice for his family. Because he knew his children were not righteous. Whenever they would go for a party after, he would sacrifice for them. Which means that Job was most probably very right with God. And then Satan tries to sweep him and off his legs and takes everything. And Job keeps quiet for very many days. And many people come to him telling him that maybe he has sinned. He should repent. They tell him, "Job, have you done this? Job have you done this?" and he says no. And then let let's look at what he said. He said that I know my redeemer lives and he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though and though after my skin worms destroy his body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. So here we can notice that Job was fully persuaded He said, "No matter what you take away from me, no matter what sorrows you befall on me, no matter what you bring upon my life." Job goes back and reads the Bible. He notices that uh that that he will see God one day. He notices that he has not done anything wrong. He just knows that he will see God one day. And he knows that my redeemer lives. That's how we should be today. Many times things come across our ways. And what we do? We go to our friends and we tell them this this whenever I'm pressed down, I go back to the Bible because this Bible has everything you need. It doesn't matter what condition you're in as long as you get persuaded. The best thing you can do is to get persuaded. There is something I left out at the beginning. Uh we realize that these people actually they had faith and they could not be persuaded by the things they are seeing. But the Bible says that they were seeing something. But it doesn't mean it doesn't mean they were seeing these things with physical eyes. These people had faith and they were looking at a city to come whose builder and maker is God. They didn't look at what they had around. After all, the Bible said that they didn't even get the promises. But that means they were having faith. And then the Bible tells us that faith comes by hearing. And by hearing the word of God. So hearing the word of God can help you actually to grow that seed within you. When that seed grows within you, you start noticing that you're not of this country. You start noticing that something is wrong around here. You notice that this is not your home. If you've been from the world, you feel like coming back real quick. Uh I remember one of the one of the questions which uh uh pastor was asked, pastor Keith, they asked him, "What would you say to the younger cave? He said I would I would ask him to pray more. I would ask him to mean business. I would ask him to do this and that. So when that seed inside you grows, you start noticing that there are better things you would have done. You start noticing that maybe you wasted time out there. and then you get to business. But that only happens when you're persuaded with the word. And so the more we feed on the word, the more we get convinced like that seed which fell in the in the good ground and some produced 30 some 64. I believe that people have different measures of faith because of how they feed on the word. Let us learn to feed on the word. Another man was Abraham. Abraham was a man who lived in the land of Ur and his his parents died and now he's there maybe having a hope of of staying there and uh getting land for his great grandchildren and something. But now God comes to him and tells him. God tells him to move. Can you imagine what do you think in Abraham really made him to move? I I believe that Abraham was a real seed of God. The first word he had believed and and there are very many people who are like that. Uh in in Genesis chapter 12 verse one it says now the Lord said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred. house and to a land that I will show thee, and I'll make of thee a great nation, and I'll bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a father of many generations, and I'll bless them that will bless thee, and cast them that cth thee. And in this shall all the families of the earth be blessed. So Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and Lord went within with him and Abraham was 75 years old when he departed from her. We can see Abraham was another person who has touched in his heart. That word which God came which God told him it immediately touched his heart and he noticed he he had to leave. He was in a wrong place. But God doesn't take you from a a good place to a worse place. God always takes you to a better place. So many times in our lives, there are things we don't want to move away from. When that word comes to us, it comes to us in power. And I believe it comes to us with the power of love. It's it's only by love that we could be saved. Because after all, we are all sinners. And even if I leave this, I have already done [Music] it. So I believe that the word comes with love. It comes with a a certain kind of grace. So uh when when we when the world tells us to leave certain things, sometimes we harden our hearts. And when you harden your heart, it means that now the word can't win you. Jesus talked about those who hardened their hearts by themselves and they refused to move away from what they were doing. And then in in in uh in the sermon here, we have no continuing seat. It says it I think of when Abraham left the city of Ur and the land of the children. He was sitting a city whose builder and maker was God. Now there was something in Abraham that he could that he could see that that he could see that great city of Ur. [Music] Uh it says and by instinct or by the leading of the Holy Spirit he hunted that city whose build and maker was God. [Music] So he so journed in a strange land professed to the pilgrims to be pilgrims and strangers and seeking a city and dwelling in tents with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and so forth. So Abraham actually left his homeland and he was going to a strange land. He literally left all the riches of his father and he was now going to a strange land where he doesn't know where he's going. He doesn't know where it's located. But I can say that when you follow God, you don't have to know what's ahead of you because what's ahead of you is perfect. So you don't have to say if I go for service maybe I'll get an accident. Don't think like that. God knows what's ahead of you. You can imagine this man literally denied his homeland. And and here it says that they were sleeping in tents. Can you imagine living maybe a very big comfortable place and then he goes just wandering around looking for a land which he doesn't know uh in in Philippians 3:7-9 it says that But what things were gained to me? Those I counted lost for Christ. Let me just read. But what things were gain to me? Those I counted loss for Christ. Yeah. Doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Jesus my savior for whom I have suffered the loss of all things. and do count them dang but and do count them but dang that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith. So this is Paul is another who was persuaded in his heart. Paul is a man who had much education, maybe more than any of us here. I don't know how the education was, but Paul was a man who had a he had a basis of his life. Maybe even if Paul was just from the church, he would have riches to continue with. I can say he had an enough knowledge to make him more wealth. But when Paul met the pillar of fire, when he was when he was still soul by then, when he met that when he met that pillar of fire and he asked and he asked it, "Who are you?" And he said, "I am Christ to your persecutor." At that very point, I believe Paul was a man who really loved God. Paul was a man who did all he can to protect the name of God. I can still say Saul when he was still Saul, he had a really good heart. He had a heart for God only that he was following the wrong thing. But when Paul met that pillar of fire and he said, "Who are you?" Because he could see it clearly. And then he says, "I'm Jesus you're persecuting. Paul immediately got I don't know how he felt but I'm sure he really screamed all along he thought he was worshiping God all along he thought he had studied his theology to come and serve God to the best and maybe Paul was sure that when Jesus comes he will be he would be uh maybe credited for for for protecting the word and these were keepers of the law. But when Paul made that pillar of fire and then the person who prayed for him was one of those he was persecuting and even they baptized him. Paul noticed that this God uh these people were serving was a true God. Immediately Paul got so convinced and he says, "But what things which were gained to me, I counted loss for Christ, completely lost." Can you imagine someone giving up their life's plan? The only way you can do that is when you are fully persuaded. And what we need today is to get convinced. We need to get convinced by the word. We need to sink deeper in the word because you can't finish what is here. Uh last time I was talking to Shem and they were talking about a certain a certain someone [Music] by all of us were saying whenever we go back we get a new thing. We get a new thing. That happens when you read the word. You can never exhaust it completely. So he counted all those things are loss and then he says that he counted them d that I may win Christ. There are many things in our lives we have to count as d. There are many things in our lives we need to give up. There are many things we hold on to as life to us. They are suffocating our spiritual life. I believe Saul's education was suffocating his spiritual life. It was real. It was really suffocating him until until it couldn't hold anymore until until Jesus had to meet him and change him. Jesus has to meet each one of us and change us. And then another one was uh was David. I believe David was one also who was persuaded that even when David would sin, David knew that my God can't leave me. I believe David knew his position. Many times he go astray and we we hold on to ourselves and we cry on our own. Something I noticed is that that crying, if you're crying on your own, it is a loss for you. You rather spend that time going to work. God is not pleased with unbelief. Now, when David noticed that whenever David would go against God, David used to go before God because he was so persuaded. And then he says in uh in Psalms chapter 23 verse 4 Psalms 23 verse4 says yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy road and thy staff they comfort me. David was talking about walking a rough path. David was convinced in his heart that God can't leave me. David was persuaded in his heart that no matter what happens, no matter what I do, God won't leave me. Whenever I would come before God, You tell God, I am but a man. I'm a man born of a woman. David noticed the grace of God. He noticed that he found favor before God. And he will just come before God and say, "God, I know I am persuaded that you're able. I'm persuaded that you're able to forgive me. I'm persuaded that you're able to carry me. I'm persuaded that even if I fail, you won't fail. I believe we all have to come to an an understanding that God can't fail. And the Bible says uh Jesus talks about those who come to him, he will in no wise cast them away. But many times we fear to go. It's because we are not convinced. Who is God to you? Jesus asked his disciples, who do men say that I am? And then they said, some say you're this, some say that. Then he said, who do you say I am? And then Peter was inspired and he said, you're the son of God. So today I can say that who is God to you? How has God revealed himself to you? You know there are people who have a gift of healing but they believe beyond doubt that when they lay their hands on you that you will heal. You'll get well. But those people can cry for food. Maybe they don't have enough faith that God can give them food. Maybe God has revealed himself to them. Maybe they know God is a healer. But us as believers, we know that God is everything. God is everything. We don't have to go to him because maybe I need food, then I can't ask for this. God should be our friend. And I believe that God can reveal himself to us in any way. God can convince you. God can put you in a situation which can convince you that he can do anything for you. I believe that God can do for me anything even when I feel as low as low. I go back in the Bible and I read that I won't leave you comfortless. I will be with you. I will carry you through. It's because I am persuaded. God has taken me through things that when something comes, however long it takes me, I remember my experience and I remember that I am really persuaded. I am sure that you won't fail me and I'm sure that I'm sure that God won't fail me in any way. And and the last one I wanted to read is in the book of Philippians chapter 3 verse seven. Uh sorry we already read that it is uh maybe I didn't write it but uh it was Timothy it's in the book of I think first Timothy where Timothy was confessing he says that I know who I have believed I am fully persuaded that he is able to to to take which I've committed against him. So he was completely persuaded in today. We really need to get persuaded. If you feel you're not yet persuaded, go back to the word, read the word. go deeper in the word. You can't exhaust the word. You may not realize that you're growing. You may not notice that that seed inside you is growing. But there's going to come a time. Maybe you'll come to church one day. You may be silent the whole service and that one word will just make you scream because that seed is growing. Your life is growing. I remember pastor preached a sermon of you can never be the same. As long as you stay under the word and you subject yourself under the word, you may never notice what is happening. You may never notice what is changing but there is something changing in your life. When you hear the word of God, this is something I learned from pastor. Even if you can't believe it, say amen, I believe it. Even if it's too hard for you, say amen. I remember during our pastor used to most times ask the main brothers they were called back then are those who are really active in the service and then he would he would bring a few to church during when others at their homes so that they can cheer the word. You know when you share the word it appetizes the preacher. So we used to come and say amen. Amen. But me and myself seriously sometimes I wasn't that amen just say it sometimes. But in me I knew that I'm saying amen with my with my mouth. God is going to recognize my faith and feed that seed inside of me. You don't have to feel anything to say amen. When when they say something and you want it, just say amen. I receive it. Amen. Say amen means I believe it. Be it unto me, I receive it. And that's how we should be as believers. Just like that, you're going to realize that your heart is taken away. You ask yourself how he left the things of the world. As I finish, I wanted to give a testimony. Uh back then in COVID, I was a really different person from what I am right now. Completely different. Those who saw me can believe me now. I was different. I was not anything close to this. I was completely a not even a nobody but nothing. I couldn't stand and talk before anyone. I was at my lowest point spiritually so deep down there. And then uh I I I used to come and sometimes pastor would preach and I think something in me woke up and back then I thought it was I used to just wonder what is this and then and then uh I remember I used to go back home and then something just makes me text pastor. And I tell him, I want to see you tomorrow. I see you tomorrow. He's like, "Come." So I come, I sit in used I sit in his car and then he asked me Polap. He wanted to meet me, talk to me. So then I'll just sit there and I tell him I also don't know what. So we used to talk other things and then I go back home. And then next time I text him, pastor, I want to come. I want to come. So then I come again. I sit with him and there's nothing. It bothered me. I think he also got bothered. But one thing I really like, God gave us a very patient path. So I went back home and I think it was either the third or fourth time. So I came back and I sat with him. I told him, "Poly, you've been here for two or three times. What do you have to say? What do you want to tell me?" And then I I just kept quiet. And at that point I was actually my heart was taken. I was so pulled that he didn't have to say any word to me for me to say to see the the the faults in my life. So then this time he started asking me okay I'm going to ask you did you do this? No. Have you done this? No. Did you do this? No. And I was also I don't know what was up with me that time. And then I just burst into tears. And then I told him, "Pastor, I don't know why I'm here, but whenever at home I don't have peace. Something just tells me to come here to come and meet you." And that's how it was. Something in my heart persuaded me. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know what I wanted. He just took me there. And and just like that, uh I believe pastor being a man of God, God directed him on how to deal with me. So from completely knowing, not knowing what is wrong, Now I can stand before you today. I can just say it's the grace of God. You don't have to fight your way there. Just stay under the word. I can say that the word has power. To do anything if you believe the word you can say anything and it will be that. Don't doubt. Don't doubt the God you have believed. Many times uh uh uh God has performed signs and wonders to prove this message. You don't have to be on the on the background watching for is there anything wrong with the message looking for looking for faults in the message. That is not your place. Just believe the word. You'll find yourself where you have never been. God bless you. Uh let's sing this song as we invite brother Martin. But I know I [Music] have and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep the which I've committed and to him against the dead. [Music] But I know I have believed and I'm persuading that he to keep that which have me and to I miss that [Music] day. Speak my [Music] Lord. Speak my Speak. Come and I will cry to answer thee.

It was not brother Paul is speaking but the Holy Spirit speaking to us. Just surrender yourself to the Lord. Are you persuaded by the word or you've just been coming? But brother, we ought to be persuaded by the word. We have to be convinced. And the only we can be concerned after being convinced is when we are persuaded, fully persuaded like the saints of all. For the Bible says that our fathers, they lived in sheep's skin. They rested in tents. They put on those sheepkin brother sister. But they were persuaded by that city whose [Music] builder and maker is God in soul. And a brother told us some even died without seeing that city. But by faith they were persuaded. Hallelujah Lord Jesus. Father, we surrender our hearts to you this evening. We thank you for the word you have sent us this day. Father, we pray that may the great Holy Spirit may come and compel us tonight and persuade us, Lord Jesus, that this is true, Lord Jesus, like the disciples were persuaded. And they said that this very word, the word which was spoken, the word which was in the beginning, we ate with him, we walked with it, we touched him because they were persuaded by that word, Lord. Heaven Father, thanks what we need, Lord. We are living in the time, Lord Jesus. in the ends of the end time and we are seeing many are leaving Lord. Many are forsaking the way it's because they have never been persuaded Lord. But father we thank you but that you have brought us this long way because we are persuaded Lord.

Hope I believe to believe the word. Father, we bless you and your name. We love you, Lord Jesus Christ. Father, we need more of you. More of your grace, Lord, more of your anointing, more of your blessings and more of your revelation is because they had the revelation of the word. That's why AB gave more extra sacrifice. Precious father, Lord Jesus, we know that you may not be feeling it, Lord. But the Holy Spirit in the minister saying that we just have to believe it anyhow Lord must believe it Lord Jesus because nobody comes and you chase him out Lord restore the comes to be father to you. Must believe that you are and you are reward of those who seeketh you tell must be persuaded that you are. For you are the high priest touched by the feeling of father.

We ask that you bless him where he has gone. May the great Holy Spirit use him in a mighty way. Lord, he will come back with a testimony and we shall be careful to give you the glory and praise.
