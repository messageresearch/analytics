may we be all encouraged in the world amen amen amen [Applause] away helping the family of brother Peter is moving from iganga back to Kampala yeah I understand they had delays but we thank God that

I'm talking about for the service this is [Music] young people there are really Desiring to hear the word I was there last Saturday Saturday two weekends with the one which we had a visit and another one where I was in Nairobi in a super weekend but when I returned they told me that I should keep going back again yeah we were about to get into Community they are of course as you know all members of that Aviation school but I believe God is starting something there let us just remember them in prayers I'll be there once again so actually I was informed that one or two I don't know the number but they're planning to come and join us they've already been joining us along foreign and we are reading verses 3. uh to six [Music] so as usual just have uh I'll just have a small sharing and then we will go to prayer thank you for your sacrifice to be here amen first sorry Philippians chapter 1 verses foreign so this is a poor writing today uh right into the Philippians and it says brother you need to sort that you need to find out what the problem is and get it sorted um on Fridays we usually have have uh half teams so maybe he's not the person so uh we are looking at verses three to six I thank my God upon every remembrance of you always in in every prayer of mine for you or making requests with joy foreign for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ you know [Music] so I'm speaking to you tonight on a thought he shall accomplish it is on verses 6 in the Amplified he says convinced and confident of this very thing [Music] [Music] so the problem is this one okay he says I'm convinced and confident of this very thing but he who has begun a good work in you will continue to perfect and complete it will continue to perfect and complete it is yeah that's a big trick in luganda perfect you will continue to perfect and complete it is yes until the day of Jesus Christ the time of his return so I'm talking about he shall accomplish it yeah that whatever God begins finish it it does not leave it in the middle go through with it again but many times we as human beings can begin our work and because of one reason or the other question we may not be able to accomplish so because of unforeseeable facts [Applause] and so is life many things in our life we don't get to complete many things you wake up one morning and say today I'm going to do ABCDEFG and then by evening you realize you have only accomplished and then you begin again I didn't accomplish it all right I'll do it tomorrow and there are many people who are very good procrastinators I think I want to watch they like pushing things if I fail today I'll do it tomorrow some of you may be are the ones looking at me now and you you are you are you have been culprits of that yeah well I will do something tomorrow I'll do it another day I will do it another day that very thing you've kept on pushing it ahead and you've not accomplished maybe you put something for two years or three years or four years or five years [Applause] and they've been pushing it ahead ever since foreign SpongeBob and then someone many times you've not come to church not because you could have or you were not it was not impossible for you to come and be said every single word because of one thing you say well I'll go tomorrow maybe you wanted to go and take the message to someone and then you say well maybe I'll talk to them tomorrow foreign [Music] we see foreign [Applause] foreign because God faulted don't think that when when the devil came in the garden and they lured the woman that God was shocked Gabriel tell me am I saying cleared is that the devil doing that Michael what should we do no that's not good that's not our God our God saw it before it happens I said when it happened all the angels we are shocked was not moved because he knew what would happen and because he knew what would happen accomplishes everything is foreign I was going to preach on something else this evening but the Holy Spirit as I was in the bathroom I had these words and I said quickly to put some flesh on this and so I'm going to you know to to share it and let us eat it together I believe God started me he must accomplish me I am a worker man the ship of God oh my good Lord in the book of Isaiah chapter 55 8. hey hmm he says my thoughts and not your thoughts I think about that my thoughts are not your thoughts is speaking foreign [Laughter] I can't make it that's not what I'm thinking it is very hard for me that's not what I'm thinking God says my way oh praise the name of the Lord our ways I want you to understand this many people they value themselves depending on the value people put on them if people think you were a fool our children you begin to feel so bad and they begin to feel like we're a fool if people think of you as a bad person movie you start to feel that you're bad and that's why we always defend ourselves when someone imagine if you're walking on the road and someone says sister brother be sincere sister brother what will be your reaction many of you will turn your face but that is his thoughts it's not the thoughts of God you understand amen don't think of yourself the value people put on you foreignty that their thoughts are not God's songs the thoughts of God are very different neither are your ways my ways for as the heavens are higher than the Earth and my thoughts than your thoughts what are your thoughts about your life what are your thoughts about your success what about about your success who are not your Victory but your success somebody throw the word to him if you get it if you don't get it just say it in English and let us move on your thoughts about your success you your thoughts about your children you see when we talk about success we are talking about you know moving from one level to another foreign according to the world if you are not highly educated remember that he was someone new you don't have a very good paying job you are you are not successful that's not the thoughts of God so the thoughts now because people think like that was about you so you begin to think the way they think and you attribute your success to what people think success is always yearning for what people think they decided to um they decided to think they decided to say well their success was on was on the best of how many people they had how how big a following they had um and then and then also they say that uh how big the how how big and beautiful a building was because we have this number following our ministry because we have these many people and we have an auditorium that sits 20 000. and they said oh we have been successful God has blessed our denomination no it's not the same thing beautiful your building is how you believe the word of God if you believe the word the true word of God and let me tell you we are successful hallelujah amen in this message I said we are successful this is the most successful Ministry in the whole world hallelujah amen you know but our soul our thoughts about our church our thoughts about you know or whether we shall make it to the Rapture or not our thoughts about marriage and also watches let me when I talked about our church when you're gonna sell free and sometimes even our first about our preaching as preachers many times we think that um I don't know for you preachers if you have ever preached and you say ah today it was a massive it was wonderful that's when you know everybody was happy and there was a noise but there are times when everything is but then all of a sudden someone comes and tells him so it was my thoughts sometimes sometimes when people jump and Shout we think oh yeah but that's your thoughts he knows that you God cartoon moves where his word is how we feel it or not I will read for you in a few moments say he says his word you cannot return unto him when his word is giveness that's a life-changing impact it impacts your life and changes you forever you see your thoughts about marriage I don't think I'll ever get married this is difficult but what is God's thoughts your thoughts about your income about your job you thought about you the ministry you thought about foreign see who but let me ask you a question who are you guani why are you here well I told you how did you get here either was the hotel one you were a child of God and you are a work of God that means he started it that means he must accomplish it again hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord amen in Isaiah 51 10 it says for us the rain cometh down inside and there's no from heaven and makes it bring forth and birth [Music] that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater hallelujah amen who does that Ania College God makes the rain to come down God makes the snow from Heaven to come down and it does not return the rain does not return the water does not return and you know it brings forth whatever is in it that it may give seed to the sower and may give bread to the eater so in the same way he says he says so shall my word be that going forth out of my mouth he says it shall not return unto me voice the word is Jesus Christ what is the message whether you think it will or not accomplished hallelujah amen as long as what I'm preaching to you is the world that's why I always tell you yes let the Sinners come in here if they come with their sin praise the name of the Lord amen you know even my sister you know let me tell you our sister for a while she was not born blind sister foreign [Applause] and when the person would believe citizen what God can do then God will move to the prophet and he would look at the bill of fire and out of that he sees a vision and then he only declare us you are in this condition oh yes you you believe you I believe it in the name of Jesus and right there and then a person would receive it is in the Church of the Living God hallelujah we believe it shall accomplish this is why you may not feel it you may not see it but if you believe it your eyes are able to open up hallelujah amen he can't open one person's eyes the work which is started in the beginning the Bible says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and foreign why it has been sent out of my mouth it shall not return unto me foreign it shall not return the rain comes from the sky and it falls down and he cannot return the word of God has already gone now it cannot return without accomplishing the power passes he shall accomplish that which is which he pleases not what I but he is he will accomplish it is hallelujah amen did he start your life you will accomplish it [Music] I take foreign [Music] [Music] I am okay he did not rely on you to accomplish yes God doesn't rely on me to accomplish yes I may not be the most perfect person make many mistakes
