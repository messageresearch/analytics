that to my king jesus you may forgive us throughout the day of jesus christ we are very sorry thank you jesus christ okay so i just want to meet you in the name of jesus christ yes god bless you those who are here god bless you amen uh i believe that we are going to have a wonderful time this evening uh where i'm just trying to get the network here okay okay i think everything is fine now yes um uh amen we are happy to see you over there there's another sister which is some messiah peace does anyone know says where are you oh you're very funny supposed to be near somewhere do you know sister peace cheese sorry you know her okay so sister peace would you like to greet us would you like to so that we can get to know you if you can hear us would you like to switch on your video and you greet us so you can know who you are i would appreciate that very much otherwise uh i'm expecting i was expecting also this is brother martin's house to be a part of the fellowship this evening but i see that maybe they've got a challenge of the network well uh we've already prayed and uh how many are ready for the fellowship for the bible study this community amen i guess we are all ready so now uh brother carol i'd like i would like you to uh maybe begin by giving us a report on what is covered or what was supposed to be covered and how much uh you mind doing that would you like to come here or you can try to go over there and see if the sound is fine okay bye unless you judge it's a privilege to be talking to you this afternoon as the program was shared i hope each one got the program how the lesson plan was much about it just like to give you the objective of the plan the objective of this plan it's a daily study plan to keep us reading the message every day not even for single day are we going to be out of the program and daily and maybe we are going to do as it's saying that form that you received so we got started with the chapter one the revelation of jesus christ and um we're so happy to i may say we've covered one chapter and by this time i hope that everyone is ready but all in all i pray that god gives us the grace to study is what may give us that young let us to study the one i'm so happy to here means studying the world like when you go to church you go and have singing you have specials and then the word what introduces us to the widely the songs that we see so i'm here to discuss with pastor and how we can have that song practice also on that team and i believe my plan that will be on wednesday at least on wednesday we do come here for the service that starts around six seven so if we can come early enough round five we can have some practice also conducted that is what i'm coming up with but it's not yet approved why i'm coming up with this is because many of us don't know all the songs in the simple book that small book that's why we see you it's not having a special song on sunday we have become church ladies and therefore really we are not doing much that's what i can say because what i know about our generation is the youths is one that the devil is so much targeting because i don't believe that the devil can talk like my mom at this time because for her it's like she's in her 70s now so if i compare her life and mine it's quite challenging in that i so much have like so many temptations reasons when i leave faster states i slow down i see so many women around me have been trained you understand it by the time i get home i've seen what my mother has not seen why she's at home she's sitting she doesn't even if she has another phone she has less use of it but you and i who i use are so much excited to these things there are four that is why i so much appreciate our pastor for coming up with such a plan i'm also happy to bring attention that we shall be having youth meetings this youth meetings helps a lot like for instance when as students many of other students when you come back home from school we are not guided this is the youtube that i'm talking about before we go to school it's my suggestion that we'll be having a meeting as use guided by our pastor and some other who can be in our minds to discuss with us also the purpose for the youth meeting is to allow for correction remember the child of god loves to be collected and therefore in whatever way it comes to us as long as it's a correction it's my prayer that will receive it i don't have much to say since most of the things i have here have not been approved in the past but i promise the next meeting which will be on friday love all these things will give you how the program will run all right otherwise i'm so happy maybe bless you as we share amen well brother god bless you so much and really thank you so much for uh for that wonderful introduction uh you know when i was in ethiopia on one of the last trips actually one of the the last trip they election not one of the last trips but the last trip that i was in ethiopia brother o'kello and i spoke and i really saw something in him that he has a burden for the young people to be that close to the lord and i know that god will use him so being that we are in a lockdown uh here of course in uganda uh i see i see you now sister peace i think you are with your sisters and is that a brother uh i can't see him clearly uh well whoever you are we are happy to be with you i think this these are the only young people that are visiting us that we have but there is the rest of us are from here we know one another already i want to welcome each of you and uh my vision is we're in a lockdown now and uh what are you doing at home well of course you me you might be reading books uh but are you reading books every every moment how many read books for two hours during this lockdown raise up your hand books not bible not bible message not bible message your books at school for at least two hours at least two hours so we only have one person my my my my oh we have one more there okay you guys are doing well you're really trying huh because to read the three books in this locker room for at least two hours i know you might you must have struggled so it's not it's kind of tough you know and uh you know the first locker down the people came in and they said well uh they tried to read even i have shame here i try to read and read and read but after a short time ah he just gave up and he was like ah we shall even go back to school so soon so friends what i'm saying is uh lockdown kind of gets us disoriented and you you find many people going into many unnecessary things yet they could have used time to do valuable things like this now which i think we are doing this is the most valuable thing that you can ever do sometimes you don't have enough time to go to get into the message even read the message you know it's kind of too many kind of they say it's boring because you know you're just reading and you're not used to of course if you do something that you're not used to doing certainly it will be boring for you let me assure you of that if you're not used to reading the message and you start reading it you it will be boring for you if you've not been listening to the message and you start listening to it it will be boring for you but the question is can we take this time of the locker down and use it for the glory of god because we do not know how long it will be it might be how many more days now ah this is saying yeah but you're not entirely sure whether to say yeah uh you said i know how many days of the days we were given 42 days how many days are remaining they gave us how many so far we have covered one week so how many days remain how many weeks 31 days so it should be 31 days remaining so let's say it was going to exactly be 31 days which many of you i can see already doubting it let us say it's going to be 31 days remaining in this locker down what would you have become if you were reading the message in this 31 days and what would you not have become if you are not reading the message and certainly if you not become something spiritually speaking you will become something you know physically or cannot speak if one thing doesn't possess you another thing will possess you one day in ethiopia i preached at someone and i titled it uh you know uh you know yielding oh i can't remember the title but uh i was speaking on yielding your life and being purposed on a cause and uh there is no way you can say that in my life i don't look up to anybody i don't look up to anything there's nothing that controls me certainly in your life something controls you and if it is not christ then the world or the opposite of christ which is the devil is controlling you so we want to really focus on the world we want to focus like brother kelly was saying yes we should have time also you know for songs and you know whenever people talk about youth literate's youth meetings youth that they only think about singing and talking about marriage i think that's not the way it should be you know the the the reason why we are having problems in in young people's lives is not because they don't know about marriage or because they don't know how to see actually many of them sing very very well i tell you many young people sing very very well already so people already know how to sing and they even already talked about marriage but the reason they have problems even in those areas is because they do not know the word they don't know what they believe so but if we can be able to get into the word if we can be able to get into the message to know what we believe to know what we stand for then i tell you no matter what comes we shall be intact even if the lord comes at any time we shall be ready to go even if we go at school the lord will give us grace to go through you understand so what you feed on is what you become so during this time because we have a limited time and uh it's not like it's a uh an eternity that we have we gave out church edges discharged eight books if you have it raise it up so let us see it okay there are some people without anyone here without okay yes i can see your sister uh johan also uh sister peace messiah do you have a yes yes you have what about those friends of yours i can't see do they have look if you do not have and you want a church edge book because for you uh to continue on with this bible study it will be very good for you to be reading and to be on the same page with us so we can be able to follow along very well together okay so uh now i uh we gave out these books and we have been trying to uh we have been trying to get into it i uh we have a reading plan brother kevin but i think has given out a reading plan to each and every one of you uh is that correct please i would like to hear an answer yes you have a reading plan for the first chapter so how many have finished the first chapter here how many are finished in the first chapter wow one two three four okay i stay about four hands one two three four how many have not finished the first chapter one two three four five okay so we have more that i've not finished the first chapter uh sister uh johan did you finish the first chapter yes uh okay uh what about sister a piece over there did you read the the the first chapter of this book she never knew okay but i believe by now she has really if she had the book she probably had some time taking time time to read the first chapter okay well i uh i see that so we we agreed that we would read we have a reading plan brother can i have a copy of that plan so i can go through it a little bit before we get into the details do you have a copy of it here is it on the whatsapp group okay let me check it out here uh i think all of you received that reading plan on the whatsapp group and if you're not in the whatsapp group and you want to be there for this youth bible study please let us know and uh you there i can't find it i don't think it's on the whatsapp group oh yeah it is so uh i see the revelation of jesus christ it was meant to be read for three days from 26th to 28th and today is 29th so i believe by now everybody should have finished the first chapter but i see there are many actually that have not finished it than the ones who have finished it but i'd like to encourage you please please should i kneel down let me request you kindly protect this series this is more serious than anything that you have ever done than any books that you have ever read why because it is connected to you're going in the rupture how can you go to the rapture when you don't know that you're supposed to go in the rupture it is this message that is going to let you know that you are supposed to go interruption that you're supposed to get that confidence that you're you're supposed to get that revelation that you're supposed to go and now that i received these questions from those that have been reading of course there are there are also those uh other chapters the reading plan you will have it so i will not go i will not read it through and the purpose is that uh we are able to finish this book we get into more books as well and uh before i i get into the questions there is something i noted here that brother banham says those of you who have read who have read this uh introduction i don't know if you took time to read the introduction you can look at it there he says he says this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the revelation talking about the church ages for out of the ages meaning the church edges calm the seals shame can you get me a silver and out of the seals come the trumpets and out of the trumpet calm the vials did you see that yeah we have the book of the revelation of the seals some of you maybe just look at it and see it in a distance and you have maybe never even touched it how many have read it all of it okay so one person only brother keller have you read this book all of it so we only have one person that has completed it two people and one has not completed it and uh if you have not if you do not know the relationship of the series let me put it to you today you don't know the message yet you don't know what you believe yet the the church edge book is like the foundations because because the the doctrines all the foundational doctrines you find it taught here on godhead on water baptism on a on on a you know the the coming of the lord on the serpent seed you know all these other major major teachings it is taught in this book of the church edible and actually i find more scriptures in here than the ones of batabana you know it puts most every idea he brings he accompanies it with the what with a scripture and by the way some of you may not know but this church edge book is the only book that we have in the message did you hear what i say what does that mean all these others are summons preached sermons even by the bottom preached on the charts seven church edges one by one by one by one but this one was the only edited one they took uh uh they i forget the name of the brother what's the name of the brother you used to call him doctor who brother carol can you help me some somebody help me the one who edited the church edge book anybody knows yes sorry no no no no no not didn't say his name is level dr dr liv vale is the brother that uh that uh edited this church this exposition the book on the exposition of the church agents there are things that brother banham had said in other summons that he had not preached within the series of the seven churches church ages so he also told him to incorporate them so and this book was edited perfectly it is it has proper grammar whereby even if someone is reading they have con it has continued are you following me uh you're not following me right you're following me so it has continued so that you can be able to study one by one by one by one and understand everything okay so uh they may the major basic teachings of the message really are in this book once you finish it and understand it we can say now you understand the message now the next thing would be for you to receive the what the spirit because the holy spirit and understanding are two different things you can understand but if you when you understand it does not necessarily mean that you are filled with the life of that word which you have read so but for for the understanding for the purpose of understanding it is this book once you read and finish it so i'm believing that when we study it and many of you who have who have thought you were believers we realized maybe you need to believe very well now after reading and finishing this book amen so uh how are we doing it we are not going to be coming here to read why because it will take much time and it will not yield much so the the arrangement is you read at your own pace at your own time according to the reading plan which is given then we just meet here for the liberating we're talking about those things which you have read you understand yes so then maybe if you have questions we take those questions if you you know you have a comment but for for us i have three people here who asked questions one is sister peace another one is unfortunate and sister rachel and i think i have more i saw on what's up and really those ones who came in much later i will not deal with them because brother carol was encouraging you please send in your questions much earlier please you know because since we have a limited time we want to cover everything in we have already covered already much time now and we have not covered much so you can still whenever we meet we have much to talk about and we have better little time but i'm going to first give in about the first 10 minutes to some three or four individuals to tell us to give us their highlights something that they did not know that they read and got to know for the first time all right the bench is over there please take it up and give a give us give us something that you read that something that was really you what you can call a highlight in this first chapter or in a portion that you read and whatever you are speaking of course it's not for you it's not for us to judge you it's for you to encourage someone else it doesn't have to be a whole chapter you just tell us a highlight a small highlight something that was made real to you i want two brothers two sisters oh since the sisters are more three sisters two brothers okay where do we start besides the sisters okay yeah take the bench yes i'm so grateful for this gathering i'm so grateful that you said it's very good my name is and one thing that i learned it was in some portion i thought jesus jesus and christ and god are different but when i read i found out that jesus is god is he is the lord he's just one person okay i can do it here no problem so uh you know that let's go with the highlights god bless you sister fortunate for that and uh i i love the way you arrange the the the questions this is really really nice you know you give the question and the line you're getting it from on the page and the paragraph that's quite commendable i just pray that everybody every one of you will do this this is really good huh it's really good you should check this and look through and then you should really do it like this so that whenever you give me the questions i can know what it is that you've been reading and what it is that you have a question on uh well i do not take a picture of this i should have put it for you and zoom as well uh sister johan but uh you know you just know that she puts a question the line where it is from and the paragraph where it is from on the page where it is from and i think this is quite commendable because it helps me to be able to address the question knowing what was in her mind when she was asking that question okay uh one more brother two more brothers yes okay polika please can you tell us what it is that was a highlight for you as uh you read this just a moment i'll tell you to go yeah thank you very much god bless you my name is brother polly cup uh what i already learned from the book i was reading chapter and it actually actually talks of revelation what we are reading is not knowledge of any mind yeah but it's revelation so giving us as we read the realization i might understand whatever you're reading i mean god bless you what i highlighted my name is richo what i highlighted is that the devil hates me two books in my bible and that is genesis and revelation you who is not clapping i'm wondering what was your greatest time like okay brother okay yes go ahead it's good i thank god for this opportunity also this time for these meetings i thank god that when i was reading chapter one i found out that this revelation is for a selected special group of people treat and understand that not all of us not all people that we really understand the revelation that is for a group of people [Music] this message is not for everyone to understand that's the truth they will try but only the bride will surely understand this message amen i think i'm waiting for one more sister who could that be [Music] yes who has not spoken can i bother through that please okay and god bless you brethren yeah for me i was very blessed and my name is my headlight was from the first revelation but which says that it is a very good a big blessing for us to hear the books and the words which are written in the revelation and and those who here and those who read so it is a very big blessing for us praise the name of the lord amen now i would like us to at this time get into the questions uh i'd like us to get into the questions i know that there could be some with questions that you've come with but i'll request you to bring them still and if we don't get to cover those questions we'll cover them later even the ones i already have here i don't think we're going to cover all of them uh but they are i'm going to begin with a scripture first of all that speaks of something that i feel that uh i did not prepare that scripture but let me get it for you here in just a moment okay i guess uh brother are you able to get me the verse it says whatsoever your hand finds to do do it or do it with all your heart i'm just trying to search it here where is it can you ready for us but the butter can protect it for us i think it's um chapter 9 verse 10 okay can you give it to us brother ecclesiastes chapter 9 or anyone who has found it okay right there it says uh whatsoever they hand findeth to do do it with their minds for there is no work no device no knowledge nor wisdom in the grave where with a thou goest have you heard how many things are in the grave can we mention them no work knowledge wisdom can we mention them again one work device knowledge wisdom so these things you cannot find them in the grave they are here on earth and that's why it says do what you have to do when you're still alive and whatever whatsoever your hand if you find yourself in school and you are studying do it with all your might you know don't go and start coupling and you know boyfriend girlfriend and stuff like that like the way they are doing the young people are doing in a while today whatever your hand friends do now at this time god has given you this opportunity to be able to get into the message and to read it god expects you to do it with all your might so when i see that some young people without in the locker down without any work to do and you have not even finished one chapter i feel ashamed i feel ashamed one chapter how many pages rather 42 pages with how many days 32 pages 32 pages within how many days four five days three days but really how many days have they had the books like four days surely it is a shame so i'm encouraging you that let us take this serious maybe god has allowed it and permitted it that we have this local down so that maybe your relationship with jesus christ can be improved and use the chance where you have the chance now i'm going to start dealing with the questions that are coming from those that have been reading and if your question has been answered let us know if not then we can be able to get into more detail now i'll begin with this some questions that sister fortunate asked and i don't know i don't know if you you want me to mention that you are the one who asked or not but the question was did john write everything in the book of revelation and all that he saw including the seven church edges did john write everything in the book of revelation did john write everything what do you mean that do you mean that could there be someone else who helped him to write who is this unfortunate oh you are writing does that mean is that meant to mean or to ask could there have been someone else who helped him to write okay that's good actually you know in the church edge book can you give me that quote please give us this course that the others also can be able to follow uh but the banham says describe and then he puts in brackets not the author the scribe not the author of this book is saint john the divine the brother on the on the projector you're acting quite slow now i'm expecting you to use a bit more speed than that okay there you go historians it says historians agree that he lived the last part of his life in ephesians though at the time of the writing of this book he was on the isle of patmos it is not the life story of john but it is the revelation of in the future church ages in verse 3 it is called a prophecy and that is actually what it is now there is something of note that i wanted to mention here uh i might have just said it but let me read it also from another message queen of sheba it says there is one thing about it a true child of god you can't hide him from prayer you cannot hide that true shade of god from prayer they tried to scold it out of john and they put him on the isle of patamus after they had boiled him in greece for 24 hours you couldn't boil it out of him can you imagine this man the reason why the holy spirit came to visit him when he was at the isle of patmos was that he was alone and he was in a time when the holy spirit you know sometimes you need to be alone for the holy spirit to come and visit you how would you expect to be close to the lord when in your ear there are earphones you are tuned in to some kind of worldly music you are dancing also their music sometimes they say well i just want to see what they are doing but i'm not actually participating no you're feeding on them things and then whatever you feed on let me tell you is what will will capture your spirit even when you go to bed what you will dream will be from the things you fed on what you talk about is what will be in your life regardless regardless of uh yes regardless of what whatever it is that you do what you feed on what you see what you hear you know i was speaking to was it you brother polycarp the other day and i was telling him that we have this is unfortunate where sister peace i don't see her is she around okay maybe the father was removing that so you can be able to concentrate here and i think it's a good idea look we have five senses how many know them one [Music] okay one by one how many senses five senses and by the bottom also in some places it calls them gates you see these are gifts that you have uh to your spirit you know uh well their guests on your on your body but you see these are guests that you will welcome things to come into your in into you you know things that maybe you may not think that is gonna come in your life and control you but whatever you see if you feed on it by seeing it you are welcoming it into your life whatever you hear whatever you touch whatever you know you can you can smell something and it will ruin your life oh it will bring you closer to god they didn't know that yes you know they are these sadistic perfumes have you heard of them you know someone will wear it and you will think of them for a fortnight you know it's meant to entice you to pull you to them and because it's what the devil does you know he wants to captivate to captivate the people's minds away from the lord and he would use what we what god has given to us because the devil is not a creator the devil only perverts what god has created so it takes the same senses which you can use to glorify god for you to be able to use them for the one okay now what is my point my point is simple is that sometimes you need to be alone with god in order for the holy spirit to come and minister to you you know you need to cut off some people out of your life in order for the holy spirit to minister to you you remember what happened to john they boiled him in oil because this man was considered to be one of the uh how they used to call them the enemies of the state the enemies of the people because he was preaching christ he was preaching one god he was preaching what do you believe what i believe and he was captured and they they boiled him but abandoned calls it greece or oil in a drum of oil can you imagine for how many hours this is according to historians and maybe one of them is naturally and he said for 24 hours this man was boiled in oil and they expected him to die of course to beat to pieces by morning you would be in pieces hello by morning before the man they are jumping and i'm like what is happening this man must be a witch so they captured him and put him in chains and took him far away they like condemned him to death of course they had already condemned him to death by putting him in oil but it did never work so they said these people who cannot die they are witches we should take them to places where they cannot come out of them unless they have wings to fly so they took him in an island or an isle of patmos patmos was a very bad place whereby you would have a lot of dangerous substances that you know dangerous frogs dangerous scorpions dangerous snakes dangerous all that kind of stuff was there crocodiles and this is what they placed him but god wanted him to get there so he can come and visit him and now all the entire book of revelation that we have today is now taken out of the revelations that we are coming to john while he was there can you imagine and john would see and hear things and it would come immediately and begin what begin writing and this is what we have today is the book of revelation so yes john never authored the book actually but the banham says that it is the only book that jesus christ wrote by himself the only people the others you know the the gospels the first words according to peter john mark luke but then the others of course you know by inspiration but now he says revelation was the only one that jesus christ himself dictated a wonderful one and john was only writing what he was seeing and what he was hearing and so the book of revelation that's why the devil hates it and we shall come to that because it was also a question which was asked and someone asked a question also and he said only who it is let me see who it is do you want me to mention names no okay this person asked and said is god eternal someone wants to talk about that if i ask a question on mine you say i want to say something about that please you are allowed to do that immediately okay it's got a turn does one someone have a question in that rather an answer you want to say something for that okay but the polycarp wants to say something on this okay can you unmute him [Music] [Music] many places but i want to understood and what is the bible actually saying something eternal there's no beginning and no end so many people ask the question really good stuff from nothing else are good about it but there's no beginning and there is okay that's what i understand what do you understand by the way [Music] i always say that i do not know if i'm always able to answer questions spot on like how the brother did that was fabulous but i don't think that i am very good at answering questions spot-on but anyways i'll try i will try i'll try and i hope if your question is not answered well then let us know so we can be able to uh get into more detail okay now that answer that he gave is correct yes god is eternal but there is something i wanted to build on i wanted to build on it because the sister has asked this question taking it from uh page 21 can you please open page 21 page 21 paragraph 2. can you read can someone read okay maybe you might want to involve sister john sister john you want to read that for us something on page page 21 paragraph two [Music] um people talk about jesus being the international of god now isn't that a contradiction however [Music] [Music] is [Music] manifested in the flesh amen god bless you for that now it is true that god is eternal but i think that the question of the sister was uh is jesus christ because there is a there is a portion there do you have it opened up places that which one where first paragraph oh yes people talk about jesus being the eternal son of god now isn't that a contradiction whoever heard of us a son being eternal a son being eternal sons are beginnings okay so now the question is is jesus god so if jesus is good how come now that he's not eternal okay so i think that's the question that the point of the question is if jesus is god how come that then is not eternal and by the bottom he's trying to say it's a contradiction for you to say oh to talk about eternal son but truly don't signs have a beginning actually we recall that brother wang and i recorded some videos that we are going to play one of the first one tomorrow uh the lord reading in the service in the evening and one of the videos on this line so i will leave it to be answered to whoever i ask this question in that service but i'm going to give a little more explanation on this as well now indeed god is eternal but he can come in many forms because god is the spirit he comes in many forms and that we are not looking at the ethanol cloud we are not looking at the tunnel pillar of fire we are not looking at the eternal you understand burning bush we are not looking at the eternal manifestation of god there is nothing like an eternal manifestation of god because that is only for a space of time and once that time is done it ceases to be all right so now when you talk about god being eternal we are talking about the great spirit god because god is a spirit can you read it in john do you have your bibles or you only carry the church edges john you don't have a bible oh please those who don't have a bible and you you have only a little money to buy let brother okay or not by the time you leave so that you can be sure to take your number and how much to take your names and how much money that you you are left with and then you shall be able to contribute for you to have a bible so but okay i hope you will not forget to do that next time on friday i want each of us to have a vibe okay so uh can you read for me john 20 john 4 24 and i see brother martin there god bless you brother martin welcome uh and the sister there as well yes god is the spirit and they that worship him in spirit yes god is a what so god is not flesh and blood so whenever we say that jesus is god we are not trying to say we are not referencing to the flesh we are not referencing to the uh referencing to the sun we are referencing to the god in no no we're refreshing to god who is the spirit but that god is in where in in jesus christ okay are you following me okay now let me read for you certain things and then i will explain uh uh some more points here okay give me this point and how we find out that we through his grace have eternal life now the word forever is for a distance for a space of time this is in line with what you were explaining brother pelican it said in the bible forever and forever a conjunction but forever only means at but eternal means forever oh now i know that might bring another question again okay i'm waiting for you to give me that quickly please and only everything that had a beginning hazard end are you looking at it there all right where was i highlighted please for me is that the message no no no no again another message i am in hebrews chapter five and six okay so he says only and only everything that has uh okay just a moment and only everything that has at the beginning has an end but things which had no beginning has no end so god had no beginning and he has no end are you following me god had no beginning and he has no that is what you can say is there a tunnel but the question here is but abandoned before i go to our question now but abandon also brings another new idea here which actually we dealt with in ethiopia when some people were asking me is hell a ton that's a good one is hell a tunnel please let us let my show of hands how many say hell is the turn okay good bye but how many say it's not eternal truth say it's the tunnel how many seconds okay how many are not sure okay well my my mind now but the banana leaves with this and i think we will use another another quote but let us use just this one okay and how we find what is that work a little bit up up up not down okay and how we find out that we through his grace have eternal life now the word forever is for a distance for a space of time you know the bible says that they will go away they will they will they will go in everlasting punishment or everlasting uh fire or some everlasting one how does this put it okay some are going to go into life and others will be will go to hell but the bible calls this hell they will how long will they be there even ii thessalonians 1 9 3 talks about it who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the prince of the lord and from the glory of his power remain on that what i wanted then here he says all right okay he talks about how long someone was asking me how long will hell be how long forever and forever and ever right but but the balamia says forever and ever is only to mean a space of time some people say even evangelists we like preaching it that way you you get saved now and you will go to heaven and have eternal life oh you leave your eternity in hell you either leave your eternity in heaven or in hell but actually there is no eternity in here because uh let me first finish it with this squat then i give you more you're going to enjoy this and we find out that we through his grace have within life the word forever is for as a distance for a space of time it is said in the bible forever and forever a conjunction but forever only means a time but eternal had a beginning i mean ethanol was that but etano means forever and only everything that had a beginning has an end but things which have no beginnings and had no end now here is my question now of course this is another question but it just came in here about hell is does hell have a beginning yes was hell created therefore is it a tunnel because everything that had the beginning has an end but that which had no beginning does not have an end and therefore hell was created so it has a beginning and it will have an end because the bible says that you have an end now if that if you want to ask that you will ask it separately and you will deal with it separately because i don't prepare the scriptures for that for now but um let's carry on with our question now we're talking about the eternity of god okay but eternal means forever and the only thing that had a beginning i mean only everything that had the beginning has an end but things which have no beginning has no end so god has no beginning and he has no end but did jesus have a beginning was jesus born so therefore what does it mean if jesus as a son of god at the beginning you will certainly have an end but god who was in christ who was in jesus christ did not have a beginning and he will never have an end okay are you following me now because jesus was a son he was begotten and i want us to look at that as well okay so uh the word begotten okay let us first read genesis chapter five genesis chapter five verse three to four and adam lived 130 years and begot a son in his own likeness after his image and afghani and he called his name seth and the days of adam after and the days of adam after it began saith we are 800 years and and he began sons and daughters and the word was made all right now uh before we get into john 1 let us look at that for just a moment okay verse 3 can you give me verse 3 brother yes up there all right now he says uh are you in genesis 3 i'm in genesis 5 i do not know what is wrong with my my projector today genesis 5 verses 3 to 4. and adam lived 140 years and we got a son you see the reason why i would like to have a projector on the screen because there are some people who do not have bibles here and they want to follow that as well as those who are streaming might not have a bible handy so they want to be sure to look at the scripture okay now uh we already have the scripture for you on the screen uh it says and adam lived 130 years can you highlight from me and begot the word begot yes okay can you click that what we got just click it go down go ahead and screw it scroll a little bit okay just just there okay can you go up a little bit i want us to study that together go up go up okay yeah it says this word is from the hebrew okay and the hebrew word is called yaland the god yalat are you following me okay it says it means what to break to bear to bring forth to beget can you go down to bring forth a child back of childbirth to bring forth or to have a child uh and then he says okay right that's to begin is to have a child or to bring forth can you now go back just the back arrow right there yes he says and uh we got a son so who who got a son adam a son in his own likeness after his what image and he called his name saith now i want you to quickly now go to uh the new testament and i want us to look at john are you there john 1 14. okay there's something i wanted to see here which will open your eyes and once you understand this then you will be able to understand every script in the new testament which talks about jesus christ and where you would be like seeing you'll never see that he's the second god anymore you will only see that he's a son of god and the son of god means god in flesh not another god but the god the very god the jehovah god putting on flesh okay read that again for us verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory remember who is the word jesus christ right you want to give us verse one verse one go quickly quickly quickly quickly to verse one okay verse one says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word right there and the word was god the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god verse two the same was in the beginning with god now if we're able to just scroll quickly and let's go back to verse 14. it says that uh in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with who okay but now verse 14 says remember the word who was what god so now this god are you following me sisters yes brothers everybody and and the word now can we not put god there can we read it together and god was made flesh you see now so we have here god and we have the flesh okay but it is the same person right but here he's changing a form and god was made flesh and he dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only you see of the only begotten can you can you click for me the word begotten there begotten of the father so he was now a son he was now a begotten son uh a begotten son okay i do not know why sister peace is saying that uh she cannot hear can everybody else here sister can you hear me okay so sister peace it might be your connection that has a problem okay all right now uh the word begotten there takes us to it says only begotten click down only only child single of its kind only used of only sons or daughters so it still points to the the other word of bringing forth child okay let's read one last one here verse 18 verse 18 no man has seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he has declared him and we can have very many verses for you which speaks of jesus as the begotten son begotten son a son which was brought forth okay a son which was born a sandwich but now in this case who is his father god now the question is when we say that abraham begot children how did he beget children the way abraham begets is not the way god begins the way abraham begets is through intercourse but the way god begins his first son that he begot was adam can you type in first adam second adam then you give us that quote as well the way that that uh god begets he doesn't beget should be got the the gay children he doesn't bring forth children like we do today that's why we are born in sin because of the way we were begotten okay but the way god begets children is through our spoken one and that's why when adam was brought forth adam was a son of god but what happened with adam he sinned and he died so therefore he needed to be kind of redeemed and for god to redeem him he had to come as as not no come on right first adam no no i just do not want you to go into the greek lexicon i just want you to go to the verse such a bible vasco and then you just type in for me first adam you'll get that quickly i think it's in 18 corinthians okay let me give you a bible verse first corinthians chapter 15 verse 45. quickly now it says can you get there if you have a pen and paper you can write it down i hope you're taking notes on on this subject and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul and the last adam was made awakening spirit howbeit that we albeit that was not fast which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the art athe who is that adam right the second man you see the other one was the first man and now this one also is the second man where is it see the first man and this is the second man he is the lord from heaven oh you people are not following me are you verse 47 the first man is off the earth athe the second man is the lord from from heaven as is the atheist such as they also that are happy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly of course if you are born according to the nature of the natural man you will be natural or acting like the natural man adam if you are born in a sinful nation the way we are born you will be sinful that's why we have to be born again according to the nature of the one who is not sinful who is the lord of heaven he says the second man he calls him a man but he says the word the lord from heaven so he has this part of a man and he has the other part of the lord so he is a golden man that's why in a video we met there i called him a god man a prophet god a god prophet you understand he was both he was a man a hundred percent but he was god also a hundred percent he was adam and that's why the bible says he was this only begotten son because the first one sinned and never fought so jesus christ was the only begotten son begotten meaning he was brought forth how did god bring him forth can someone tell him god bless you by the spoken one you know god gets begets his children by uh by their spoken word and therefore i think i don't know how we can help uh sister uh there's a sister who is saying she cannot hear us and for some reason i do not know how to to to help her okay all right right here okay so now uh the what was my point yes adam how did you how did god beget adam do you even know how adam was born come on god more than he that's a good answer but that's genesis chapter chapter chapter 2 but what happened in chapter 1. can do you have a bible can you go to genesis chapter one everybody genesis chapter one genesis chapter 1. verse 26 i'm waiting for the verse here for the for the scripture here can you read somebody let us make man in our images [Music] verse 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of both practice in him male and kingdom prejudice praise the name of the lord so god created man in whose image in in his image ah you just put it off come on i think you should let this thing be yeah so that where's the remote you can use the remote instead of just skipping on and off right now it says that uh and so god made money in his own image the image of god requested he he male and female created ye them brother buddy do you see anything like molding here so what happened go to verse 26 and tell me what happened because you said god more than man so what happened verse 27 and god and god no come on read it and god and god don't rush and god did you hear that that's all i wanted you to see and god said then verse 27 after god's saying what happened so come on read with me god created man in his own image so now was this man created mode so what happened here god said god spoke man into existence and was this a man with bones and flesh no he was a spirit man like god is a spirit man so god created man before he ever molded him now when you go to verse 2 chapter 2 rather sorry go to chapter two everybody and now you can read from verses um uh where is that okay yes verse 7 and and the lord god read with me now formed man of the dust of the crown and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a leaving soul and when you come in second corinthians where we're reading he said that god made the first man happy but this the second man the lord from heaven the first man he made him a living soul but the second man he made him a quickening spirit you know what a preparing spirit is a quickening spirit is a spirit which gives life so the second man adam was a quickening spirit but the first man adam was a living soul so jesus you cannot call him a soul okay but jesus was god that's why we do not call him a man but we call him god because jesus was a quickening spirit but yet he was a man and that's what confuses the people how could he be a man and a quickening spirit at the same time that is the simplicity of god he reveals himself in humility or in simplicity he hides himself in simplicity and he reveals himself in simplicity now you may ask you may ask me how does genesis connect now with what we are looking at because in genesis it shows us that man was created fast by the words and then later he was molded okay so the molding was really the manifestation of that which was already created because he never did create again he only breathed into him into his nostrils and then he became a living soul so now buddy before god ever formed anything uh rather ever formed man molded him he created him and before god before anything happened before anything manifests god spoke it fast into existence god is one is equal to its fulfillment whatever he speaks he fulfills it before he fulfills it before it actually happens he speaks and his word is as good as done so now let's go back to our point we are looking at a god the creator of heaven and earth the eternal god and he spoke man into existence and man was adam and in the same way spoke man to into existence in john 1 it says underworld remember the word which was not spoken right became this time it became flesh where where in the flesh of jesus in on earth in the body of a man called jesus that was the word that was god who had become flesh but now do not confuse do not say that oh jesus was the father and the son and the holy spirit jesus was the son of god a manifestation of god god has manifested himself as the father in the old testament and as a son in the new testament through jesus christ the son of god but he has also manifested himself today in us in the form of the holy spirit but the name of jesus christ is the name which is above every name and that name has manifested the name of the father the name of the son and the name of them the holy spirit so that's why when we say the lord jesus christ we mean father son and holy spirit but jesus as a man here on earth he was the only begotten do you have that one how was he begotten now can someone answer that how was he begotten to who to mary he told what mary says the peace what did god tell mary since you're a sister you may remember that very well what what did god tell mary when he came to mary through gabriel in judah do you remember that you have forgotten buddy can you help him can you help her yes it says you are blessed among women okay that you will be you'll bear a son and you shall call his name jesus so now you can see that word medicine how will these things be i am only a virgin and then what did she what did the angel answer you say he said that the holy spirit will over shadow thee and you will have a son now she said what did she say after that be it unto me come on now amen people get into yes yes she said amen but what what there's something i want from the bible there she said be it to me come on people yes come on get get the scripture don't don't get out your thoughts she said be it unto me because you see these are the things that you take for granted and then you realize you don't know them you know so once one scripture can change your entire thought of the bible it's in the book of matthew let me get it okay we can look look it up here in the gospels you can look it up but um at look just uh look at luke chapter 1 verse 38 okay can you read now but from verse 7 for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary shall mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to according it is just right there yo come on can you go back up he says bear it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed did you see what she said can you read that do it again beat it unto me all of us together one two three go [Music] according to thy what i wanted to emphasize that thing according to thy word how was jesus a begotten son by the spoken word of god he spoke the word and the word created now here is the interesting part the word created both the egg and the seed did you ever know that no because mary naturally she would have to get a husband you know the husband provides seed and the woman provides egg most of you are in school you know that right but in this case god outer outer the way of man he outed it completely and therefore he doesn't need a seed for man he doesn't need egg from woman he only needs a womb from the woman because remember once the seed fertilizes the egg then on down it goes into the womb not so but in this case god canceled the other part of the fertilization of the of the seed of the man and there yeah he canceled all that kind of thing and what he instead did he came himself and created the egg and he created the seed are you following me and then he he used his word his word to create both put it together and then a life was formed in the womb of mary the next time mary realizes is a child is growing in a womb what was that it was the spoken word of god therefore jesus was the only begotten son of god because it means what brought forth begotten means what a child born or brought forth so jesus was brought forth by how how does god bring his father's children by the spoken one even today if you want to be born again you can only be born again by the way that's why we take this time to get into the bible into the message to learn it to know so that you can also be born again one day when you're here let me tell you don't worry if now it's not really making a lot of sense to you it's all right just keep on keeping on one day when you are hearing you'll just understand the older side what was wrong with me for all those years now i see you to clear it you see what has happened you have just been born into the kingdom you see we too can only be born by the watch you see we just have to keep under but the balance says that you keep under the altar uh revelation is striking after revelation striking after revelations right you see and then immediately without even you know preparing for it there it will be it will come the holy ghost the life of christ himself now you also be a begotten son how by the way you see by the way that's why let me tell you in this process in this i don't know if you have 31 days or more but something will happen someone will be devoted praise the name of the lord and so that's how jesus was a begotten son and when we said that jesus was not eternal son we mean he was begotten also like all of us have to god yeah he will have an end but listen he that was in him is god the almighty and he had no beginning and he will have no and and therefore he is god and he alone is god actually in the video which we recorded i took even time to explain the the three of the god is going to use this sun in three offices does anyone know them yes one father son holy spirit nope nope father son holy spirit is god right but now as a son god as a son he has manifested himself in three ways also in three times three officers three dispensations doing different things other son as a savior who is he son of a who son of man yes you are bringing something you see these are the things you need to know in the message son of man son of god son of david when does son of man start sorry his ministry when does the ministry of son of man take place no no no not years not years i mean what did he do in that ministry and son of man can you refer to jesus now the son of man oh to the son of man in prayer we always say son of god right oh son of god that mercy on me oh you know because now a son of god is a spirit right he says the holy spirit is son of god but son of man he was a prophet he was a man on earth even ezekiel was called son of man son of mine is a prophet usually so when we say son of man we mean a prophet and jesus was a prophet from the time he started his ministry to the time when he went on the cross he finished that minister of son of man and now he is continuing from pentecost until the rapture he is in the ministry of son of son of god and we are waiting for the ministry now of son of david but did you know according to the scripture in i think luke 17 30 if i'm not mistaken the bible promises there will be another manifestation of the ministry of son of man again between son of god and son of david okay is that so deep can i can we go into that a little bit now someone wants to say something on it first before we go into come on now no one yes no son of god yes you want to say something all right you can sorry son of god yes we are now in the son of god this translation for the jews thank you son of man but he has already manifested himself as son of man for the jews yes he he he jesus when he was on earth he came in as as what did he do as a son of man you need to first understand the ministry of jesus as the son of man yes you want to take them so because that the others can also join you no you can't go come on go ahead go ahead no problem you can't even stay there all right yes you want to contribute something okay okay yes right and son of mine he was like after being born four years later of course they killed his father calling the disciples then read that okay now that's correct yes as the son of man he did all that but you also have to remember that jesus christ as a a son of man he had a particular work to do a particular work to do do you understand that his major purpose was to die on the cross as a son of man that was his major purpose but he also manifested himself in as a like you said as a healer as a deliverer as a savior you know did many things while he was on earth before his death but one of those that manifesto showed his ministry come on you should know this he manifested it one time to a woman and she ran to the city and said come see a man who has told me everything of that he said this the very messiah what told her that that's the messiah but who was that woman first of all let us remember how fast this is a marijuana woman and what did this woman do well of course she had she was a prostitute kind of okay she had many men and she lived her life and then and then eventually she she meets this man jesus christ that told her that she had lived with six uh six men rather six five men yes and that even the sixth that he was with was not uh a husband what was jesus trying to say he was saying you've been with five men even the six even the sixth right now is not yours in other words to mean i am the man now the seventh i am the one who has come to you indirectly jesus was trying to announce him his arrival i am the messiah i am the man who has promised to come i am he like it all those people if you do not believe that i am he you will do what die in your sins and here jesus begins to talk to that woman and the woman you know jesus did not announce himself of course like that but i'm telling you what he was trying to do by what he did you understand that so now after he you know asked her those questions and you know everything that the woman you know what when jesus said give me water she's she was like ah first we have some matters there's a question about somebody confused i will deal with that in our next meeting i say afros we are surmising what do we have to do with you you know we don't like you you don't like us so what what is it huh and you know of course even the time she had to come at the well it was not a good time certainly it shows you know in israel there are women that are unknown the good ones go in the morning and the bad ones go at the time when the sun is so hot right so this one was a bad one you just knew that she was going to beat her so now by the time that she just met her she was like you know like a kind of thing so by the end of the conversation jesus said if you knew she said if you knew what kind of a man was that was asking you to give him water you would know that the water i would give you if you drink it you will not fast again go fetch me your husband i have none i have none leave me alone say yes you spoke well you don't have any you have been having five and now you are even living with the sick but even this is not yours he said what he said what was in her heart her heart was cut to pieces and she remembered because samaritans and the jews knew the prophecy of the coming of the messiah and what the messiah would do because the messiah would be the son of man you understand so now when her heart was discerned you remember that the only one that was can be able to design your heart and tell your name what you have done and everything in your heart not in your mind but in your heart we are not talking about the gift let me let me bring this to the end now because i need you to understand this you will now eventually help you to understand this message in a better way look we are not talking about then one of the gifts in the nine spiritual gifts because there are nine spiritual gifts and one of them is the discernment of the spirit of the people right you you know you know you you see prophets many times you spend the pentecost i see in my spirit and i begin training it right so now we're not talking about that kind of gift we are talking about the sign of the messiah what is the sign of the messiah please follow here the sign of the messiah follow follow this thought now the sign of the messiah is that which shows the characteristics of the characters and the nature of god himself when do we see it first we see it with melchizedek you remember that you remember how mere kisses they came to abraham and he told him that you are going to get a son after according to the time of life you know next year and and and the sarah was in the tent and it was in our heart not outside but merry christmas the tent was behind him but he was able to hear that and he said hmm abraham said why did you sad your wife laugh and santa had that she said ah i did laugh did you hear me laughing but then she laughed she laughed in her heart so she expected no one would know that she laughed now who was that that would be able to tell or sarah what she has done in her heart who was that that would be able to call sarah by sarah no sarai abram by abraham not abraham who was that that knew their names their new names that knew what they had done and knew what they were expecting from the lord it was god himself right yes and that was the first time he manifested that sign that messianic sign but we don't see it again until jesus came and he was born and when he was born he manifest that among other jews he called nathanael he told him where he was you remember that he called who was who is the call a peter he told him that he was son of jonas he called you remember and then eventually he meets the samaritan woman and with the samaritan woman is very very clear he tells her everything this woman was like this is this messiah we were waiting for he's the one he must be the one children and she went to the city she's gonna say you people come and sit for your setups come and see and here was her statement she wasn't too sure but she was sure by herself but she wasn't she wouldn't judge for them right so she told them come and see this man who has told me everything i've done he said this the very messiah you understand why was she suspecting that this could be the messiah show of hands yes yes yes yes yes that's the same thing but everybody could speak that so what's special about it yes god bless you as the as i was waiting for she this woman rather this jesus did what was expected of the messiah to do when he should come so she went and told them come and say isn't this the messiah you know when someone tells you when when uh when ocaro comes he will be you know like this and he will tell you this way so when he comes and he tells exactly and he looks the same way you'll be like come and see this okay you understand you've never seen okay you don't know keller but because you know what a color would do and you know how it would look when it comes you will surely be able to tell you understand and these people came running and when they arrived there they saw the woman they saw jesus they looked at the woman they said you woman we have believed but not because you did what not because you told us but because we have seen with our very eyes and we have had by our own ears they saw also and they confirmed that he was the word now do you know that jesus revealed himself as the messiah among the jews and the gentiles but he never revealed himself as the messiah among the i mean among the jews and the samaritans but he never revealed himself as the messiah among the gentiles does anyone know why he never did reveal himself among the gentiles at that time show of hands yes but he did work with the samaritans he revealed himself to the samaritans so yes that's correct but not entirely correct yes look people the jews were expecting him not sir the generals were they the samaritans were expecting him not so not so did the genders even know about anything about the jesus the messiah did they so where are we expecting him no because our great great fathers were not expecting him they didn't even know anything about that they had never read the books so how could they expect someone they don't know so jesus had to wait for more than 2 000 years and the genders know him very well and then he will come and also reveal himself among them and there is a prophecy on that can we read it yes all right and then i will tell you what has happened now generation okay go to the book of luke give it to me here on the screen luke luke chapter chapter 17 do you have it chapter 17 verse 24. okay it's right there okay for us the lightening that lightens out of the one part under heaven shines under the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his dna he's talking about who the son of man are you following actually following yes he's talking about the son of man right okay verse 25 please let us follow on we are about to finish okay but first master he suffer many things and be rejected of his generation of this generation and as it was and as it was in the days of who as it was aware so shall it be also in the days of the son of man continue what happened in days of noah they were given a marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all now hey please can you can you sit down now friends i want you to hear this can we can you agree with me if i say that the days of noah where was the end time of that generation and actually of the whole world can you agree with me come on some of you don't agree why do you agree that it was the end times only that because people even people die today everyone yes okay that's a significant point but here was the reason why it was the end time one there was a man that god sent with a message specifically to that generation and that they were supposed to accept that message of perish right that that qualifies it to be an end time because before god does anything in the world according to the book of amos chapter 3 verse 27 surely the lord god will do nothing but but he revealed his secrets these scriptures you should read write and then read later but the reveal is seconds to who to his servants the prophets in other words before anything major happens in this world god first reveals it to his servants the prophets after he uh he reveals it then it happens you understand so we see also in the days of jesus uh in the in the days of noah rather he had said it would rain did it rain yes sister peace what happened the days of noah it rained and what happened after dre yes and those who did not enter what happened they died so in other words uh if if people today do not accept the message of today like in the days of noah they will perish like the people of noah perished but the only difference is the days of noah they perished with by water but today they are not perished by whether they will perish by fire can you imagine can you imagine people how serious must we be when we know that there is a message in our land like it was in the days of no you now see how serious this is getting so i want to come conclude with this and and i'll just summarize if someone wants to do something and the rest of the questions will deal with them the next time okay now for us the lightening okay we are continuing with that verse we are continuing with that verse we are continuing with that verse luke 17 24 you you must be following very very closely okay listen to this for us the lightening that lightens out of the one part under the heavens shining under the other part okay we were already down there on verse 28. likewise also as it was in the days of lord they did eat they drunk they bought they sold they planted they built it just like our generation people are doing all these things are they not but the same day that lord went out of sodom and of manner again the same day that lord what the same day that you the bride will go out of this ass the same thing which happened in sodom will happen again they did it they drank and they bought they saw they planted they built it but the same day the lord went out of sodom it rained what and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them now why is he trying to quote lord and noah because these were examples of the end time you understand he's trying to get to a point which i wanted to get to because remember he was talking about the sound of man you remember so let's go down but now i want i want even all of us to read this together one two three go for starting even that shall it be in the day when the son of man have you seen it there is a time when the son of man is the knockers when the son of man is going to be revealed again but remember he's not talking about the time when jesus was on earth because by the time he's talking about this this is when jesus now is on earth and actually jesus himself is talking these words and he's saying he's giving them examples example examples the son of man was already on earth at that time right but was it like those days when he was on earth the question is when the jesus was on earth was it like the days of lord on the days of no no the world had not come into the labor way praise the lord sorry we went off our network here had issues okay now i want to conclude on this the son of man was supposed to be revealed again in which conditions can now can you now tell me which condition the sound of my supposed to repeat himself which one is condition number one [Music] the condition the prevailing condition that would be during the time when the son of man is going to reveal himself again one people would be drinking eating giving in marriage marrying you know continuing on with the life and with everything about life and enjoying life you understand and they will reject you know the word and you know that kind of thing now he is trying to say i don't have it here if you don't mind now he was trying to say this and i wanted to hear this now jesus was on earth at that time he was the son of man do you agree yes but he is saying the condition of the world is going to be like this when the son of man must start when the son of man is revealed what does it mean when we are in the end time the son of man is going to reveal himself again now remember he's not he's not saying he's going to come again but he's saying he's going to reveal himself again is someone getting a revelation are you getting a revelation here the son of man is going to do that to be revealed again who is the son of man jesus christ himself yes remember he is not our son of man he is the son of man god himself in the flesh he revealed himself when he came i mean he manifested himself when he came on earth but he is going to reveal himself again in the end time and when is that time when is that time says isn't this the end time it is our generation so has the son of man remember oh hallelujah i don't want to preach but now i'm getting anointed to preach now listen when he reveals himself how shall we know that he is the son of man the spirit the same thing he did when he went to abraham and sarah when he went to the woman of the world when he went you understand when he went to nathan when he went to all those people the same things he did he will do again now you will know why brother panama's major theme of preaching was jesus christ they saved yesterday today and forever it was the major theme of both campaigns and meetings and entire ministry he was trying to say we are revealing just again today like he was revealed in the past you don't seem excited you do not seem to see this do you say it yes who sees it and of course if you sit i'll tell you to explain it look here before you ask let me finish this for inspiration now brother barnum don't make mistakes oh who you mean by the bottom was jesus we need to know oh come on put that trash down was not jesus like i told you he was it wasn't another coming of the son of man but he was revealing the son of man he would come to you and he would say he would preach the message right after preaching that the message then he would say if water preaches the truth then and let me tell you there is no preacher in our generation and since the time of jesus that has ever done that only by the banana has done today we have many prophets right listen to them on the youtube yeah i do you don't see me listening to them sometimes i will tell you none of them has ever said this and i will tell you who are listening to me none of them has been able to say what brother i'm saying after preaching someone then he would say if what i've preached is the truth then let the god of the bible come now and vindicated to be the truth and i'm not asking about feeling i'm not talking about feelings and excitement and people oh he's here no i'm not talking about those kind of things he tells everybody be quiet sit be down relax quiet everything is quite like here then he would say it's so deep it's recorded if you want you can listen then he would say if what i pushed you and what he was preaching he was it was so hard so tight and so cut into the heart and he would say if what a priest is true then let the god of the bible come and vindicate me and vindicate this truth to be the truth and he would keep quiet and wait for him to come hey you people what are you talking about we are talking about saint luke 17 30. it was in play it was in action and then after a moment he would say empty and then he would say he's here he's here now not that he's feeling not even excited or anything but he would be the way he was but then he would say he would announce he would make the announcement and he would say he is now here he is not two feet from where i am standing he did not say he's here because he felt nice but he would say it's here because you saw him that's how much it was he would see visions he would see in this financial world and see also in this world then he would say is he here he would call him the holy spirit he would call him the angel of the lord he would call him many things but he would say he's here the end of the covenant he's here at the end of the lord he's here not to feed from where i am standing now he would say the things now would change he the son of man christ jesus would take over this man's voice and he would now say i now put every spirit in here whether it is cancer what demons whatever it is you say now i put every spirit in this building i'm talking about thousands of people and all of them i put every spirit in here under my control for the glory of god quiet and then after that in our next meeting remind the mind machine i'll i'll put some of these clips for the people so they can feel the intense of the meetings and then be able to listen to it by themselves after that then listen i said after that moment then do you know what would happen what would follow under that annoying thing hallelujah i feel like talking times right now us under that anointing brother killer he would be able nothing would go unnoticed under that anointing nothing he can be able to call out any name he can be able to tell anybody any problem they have he can be able to tell them even what happened to them they got to call their names to tell them even their addresses and house numbers what are they talking about is there a man who can do that on earth it's not a man that was god himself the son of man revealing himself in our generation remember it was the revelation of jesus christ he was trying to show that he has money he has a calm of course every god called the prophet really reveals jesus christ right generally speaking but now in the ministry oh you people are you getting what i'm saying i want to finish with this but i want to get it also there are three groups of people and the categories of people in the world today even as it was before the first category do you know it the sodomites are you hearing that uh-huh the second category and the children hey elizabeth please can you tell the children to be silent okay now we have the first category the first category are the sodomites the second category are the low types if you follow what i'm saying and the first category and the third category abraham okay are you following me the lord tights the sodomites the abrahamides i'm good i'm making might mesmerize coming out of there sodom and meaning those sodomites are meaning the ones who are living in sodom the ones who were they the the ones who didn't care what whatever will happen let us live our life even don't we have them today don't we have the sodomites today they don't care what will happen or what god will say as long as they do what makes them happy they even call themselves the other name that they have made for themselves gays you know what they mean you don't know what game mean does anyone know what game mean it means what god bless you who said that yes some of you thought that gay is a bad word gay means happy i'm gay you are gay gay means happy you understand it means happy but the devil has received this sort of minds to think that they are happy yet they are not happy they are gloomy but they've called themselves gay in order for them to feel that they are what they are happy they are doing what makes them happy and therefore they are gay searched out a new dictionary it means happy right and so but they're not happy they're gloomy so they were going to die but i didn't care fire was coming but they didn't care you understand the angels of the lord came in their city but they didn't because they were thought they were gay so we have that category in our world today and they're the biggest of them they're the biggest right they're in governments and everywhere okay so even i'm talking t.b joshua before he is death he said something about healing such people and they they since he had the big following on youtube and of course this is on youtube now i hope they don't block me also since he had a huge following on youtube they blocked him they said he can no longer you know use youtube because how come he he he infringes on other human rights okay well they have a right to do what they want to do all right but we also have a right to do what we want to do are you following me and uh that is the first group and they are the biggest in the world my q we have another group you know that other group the royalties there are types those ones are religious those ones are the nomination of people those ones are so-called christians they they fear god they love god but they don't love him enough to run away from sin and worries they want a little bit of christ and they want a little bit of there well this man lord he was in the sort of imagine he was in sort of living there he had medicine in his home and then eventually these people when they came to him they say the angels come we go and they and then these men were coming no no we want those men who have just entered your house and then was like no tech please take my daughters they even still buy them they said ah whatever we want your daughters we want these men who have just entered in here and then and then he said brothers did you hear what you say he called them brothers he was among them these are the pastors even who they said well who am i to judge they have big followings the biggest churches can you hear that even the pope the other day he has the biggest chat in the world he said who am i to judge he can't judge the sodomites he will not do what they do but he says do not judge them all right see he will not judge them okay so friends what are we dealing with today that is the second category of the what low tides these people they oh please don't don't lose the devil is trying all right you can't make you not lose this point please stay focused here now the second category are there low types for them they are christians but they are not their bride because of many reasons and these ones they go through the tribulation they do what and the bride will not go through the tribulation but the church will the church will but the bride will not the true church of jesus christ won't of course but the church naturally nominated church will go through the tribulation now we find out that these law tites they even went to um how do i know that they go through the tribulation because you remember that fire the fire started falling when they were running so they suffered really you know even one of them the wife of lord became a what became a period of sword and many things happened then we can continue on even what happened to lord and his daughters and everything so you can see that they go through the tribulation they make it somehow but they go through the tribulation their life is not life like the life of abraham but then we have another group hallelujah that is the group of the abrahamites those ones who receive merica's neck those ones who receive the priest of the most high those ones who receive god himself the visitation of god himself in that generation in their camp so three camps are even today in the world we have the camp of the lord and of course what happened in the camp of abraham you know don't you know what was it the angel came and and he revealed the secrets of their heart and so now you can see that camp had those with who would reveal secrets of the heart but they couple the lotus had only those ones who could do miracles but the miracles they were doing they were blinding the people not so are you getting a revelation here the angels when the men we want them act they just escape and they slack at them blind by the miracles but just by power divine power right so we see that we have three cat camps even in the world today we have one camp which are the unbelievers they will not go anywhere they're just there they are they are not believing and then we have another camp that's the camp of the the the the denomination of the evangelicals they you know the you know spirit whatever they say their spiritual pentecostals what those kind of groups they will save gifts miracles signs and wonders you know prophets prophetic you know the prophetic they call the prophetic ministry they're running around with that but those miracles those sins and ones that god has given among them it is meant to blind them can i give you an example if we are if you you know how many knowledge are dismantling in the in the charismatic church you you know you are from the catholic church who knows the charismatics also here you don't know charismatics you don't have charismatics charismatic you don't know you just don't say i don't know you see the charismatic people are part of the catholic church but they worship they get in the spirit they speak tongues even did you know and after that then they begin praying hail mary mother of god now tell me is there any kind of deception bigger than that one it's the highest form of deception to make you feel you also have the spirit so why do you need to join the other group of the speakers and the the ones which were chasing demons and praying for the sick when you can do it also in the catholic church so they remain there so also god will send people in the world many people are anointed listen to this many people who are anointed to do science miracles and wonders but these signs are miracles that will be meant to do what to blind the eyes of those people because they rejected the life of the truth can you imagine then eventually we shall have another group that will be the group of the abrahamics they will receive the angel of the covenant the angel of the lord they will receive the son that they what would we call today the revelation of the son of man is ministry this message is the revelation of the son of man as you are reading this search edge book you notice he talks about revelation we didn't even cover that today but we'll talk about it next time when we meet he talks a revelation this message is all about the revelation of the son of man it's a minister of the revelation of the son of man christ himself revealing himself among us and brother banham's ministry was all about that you see the design between him he even talked about the three major messengers of the end time one he talked about billy graham two he talked about come on billy graham oral roberts and william branham that's where he talks about his name as abraham branham and you can talk about that much when you read the message you find all those things but what is the concept here god this number is what come on now if you don't shout it god is number seven god this number is seven and manny's number is six and god this number is seven uh seven is the number of god of completion right so we notice that uh god reveals himself god is this visits us in a man named in our generation a man named william how many letters mario now many letters brown hammer many letters with a h-a-m-h-a-m is god himself elohim abraham there's a lot of connotation on that anyway i'm i'm just giving it to you as uh something to inspire you is sort of like a doctrine but i wanted you to know that abraham after he hears and receives this marriage deck there is something that happened do you know what happened what was it god bless you his name was changed what what happened next sister john what happened when god visited abraham what happened yes abraham went to another land what which land was that abraham's name was changed and abraham received a child he gave birth to a child when the lord visits you in this generation with a message of the hour the purpose of the message listen to me now you'll use a different word here the purpose of the message is to impregnate you with the spirit of god so that you can bring forth a child who will be the child who will be the child with the child the child is christ god bless you the child is jesus christ he is the one we are bringing forth in this generation you are bringing forth christ out of your life you know it will be within you this word a world of springing living water a way of living water within you you can see now why you need to study the message because it is so much we can talk until now it is only me talking what about when you start and the other one starts and the other one starts you see why we need to study this message it is so broad it is so lovely it is if you believe this message you're not excited to study it and get into it then there is a problem for sure you either don't believe or you don't know you don't know what you believe you've not yet believed you see yes so friends you see today it was just an appetizer to appetize us but you have seen how much and how deep we have gone do you know how saint luke 17 is fulfilled if there is something you want to go you want to go out with today go out with this one do you know how said luke 17 is fulfilled ministry can you add that through the ministry of brother branham because brother barnham's ministry introduced jesus christ to us again and that jesus christ is william today in the form of the word the revealed one the spoken word is the review what the review what is this in our generation today that's why we call these books the spoken word books why because christ has come down to us to be revealed he has revealed himself to us again in our generation saints you now see why we need to study this message we don't need only to be students of this message but we need to to love god to the exit whereby he will reveal himself to us those who have not attached the the first chapter please read it by the time we meet again we shall dwell on the first chapter also so you have an opportunity also to read again those who are finished you can read again or continue reading again praise the name of the lord i want to end the live stream it's been so long but um is there anybody who wanted something that's something that is burning them and they wanted to talk all right is it something that you want to okay you can go ahead and brother can we put a video for you yes come on go ahead you need some clarity okay what's that can you please go ahead yes [Music] where was the holy spirit when jesus was on earth and i'm repeating that for the one who is here because they can't hear you so we discussed and um this is how we concluded yes she requested me to give us so i say lord jesus and the holy spirit are one god was the father of jesus the holy spirit was the father jesus too as much during the declares but while [Music] [Music] and that's true that's true perfectly all right yes so i don't like this look at teaching the scriptures yes did i get by yes jesus [Music] that's the spirit [Music] so what is the question now because now i don't know what i gave at the right thing [Music] but from the line of thought that you were having that was perfect that was perfect you see there is no distinction between god and jesus but the only thing to understand there is that god is a spirit and that jesus was the begotten son of god and because inside we've gone through that now to understand that jesus was the body but god was the spirit in him and any scripture that you read will tie in together with that and of course you cannot separate the body and the spirit that's why jesus christ is going okay i'm sure you want you you still need more clarity go ahead yes and then one thing also i want to tell everybody is that the word is never something that you study or learn like you learn your books in school you understand yes when you go to school they will teach you something maybe the law of gravity and you you can even just cram it and then that it will be to remain what you quran no matter how many years it is but the word isn't that way the word is god and god is huge and he only allows us to understand what he has revealed to us next time we're going to talk much about revelation and revelation is progressive progressive progressive progressive the more you yield your heart and yourself to the word the more you understand and the more revelation you receive of the same verse that you had many years ago the revelation you had is not the same that you had even after our session today it is increasing increasing it is progressive according to what you hear and what because it is faith revelation is faith we talked about it the other time revelation is faith the more you hear the more you believe faith comes by what by hearing the word and so you get into the word and the more you get into the word the more revelation you receive and certainly the more faith you believe you receive to stand by what you believe praise the lord there is a song i want us to sing as we are concluding it's about the word the original life i if you do not know it i want to teach you that song and i want all of you to participate the original life have you got it do i tell the story that

night before you sleep come on get get around you know and see you know pelican you know sing and worship the lord really for like 30 minutes what have you been doing you know do it early if you are

okay can you try now god bless [Music] god bless you god bless you everyone god bless you everyone amen amen hallelujah god bless you everyone very much god bless you everybody yes god bless you everyone amen amen hallelujah actually i've i've also been here within the service beyond my wife and sister joanne we we've really enjoyed the service and the idea precious pastor thank you so so much for for such an in-depth teaching of the word of god the only word i would like to to wish the youths today is one of the things which helped me overcome the temptations of the world was the word of god because i remember when i was still a young man there is a verse i read in the bible and that verse i i'm not very sure right now where it is but it says that whoever is joined himself to a harlot it is actually the scripture says they become the same spirit that like you share the spirit of any person you join so when i read that word all through my youth though i was still in the pentecostal world without the word but that word there is a way it kept me through so i just want to challenge you that let us not only be here as of this wonderful word but let us put it into practice shalom and may the lord god bless you all in the name of our lord jesus christ okay so god bless you so much that was uh wonderful we do appreciate that uh brother henry but i saw brother martin somewhere there brother martin you have something you would like to say we can't seem to hear you yet hello we cannot seem to hear you brother martin your connection oh you are still muted you are still muted uh let's see if i can try to unmute you now ask to unmute just unmute yourself and then we can be able to hear you okay there you are okay it seems that uh your connection is not stable by the martin but god bless you i saw you are coming in and out uh otherwise we appreciate you uh being a part of the service uh i think your guard there also was uh listening throughout god bless her and god bless you all we are dismissed as we uh just with one another and sing one more chorus just feel free to be dismissed in jesus name [Music] is victory today is mine oh victory is my
