have to be a bit loud so you can be able to hear it's my name stage that's where you are sister please where have you reached uh which page which page are you on we need to know we need to know so we can be able to follow very very closely which way is that it means you have not yet completed the equation am i right but you did not raise up your hand when i asked those who have not completed why you know you remember the last meeting i was a bit tough and i told you that we should take this serious if we are not going to take these syrias if anyone is not serious we shall seriously exclude them from this discussion because we do not want to be unserious if we are unserious then whatever we are doing is not going to be beneficial to us sister fortunate how far are people one one so you already listed okay so i don't know since that piece why you're not ready because this is quite many pages for you to have what happened you need help no i mean we all know one another so you don't have to feel like a big thing without just be honest if you really need help or if you can't read someone else can be hired for you so you need prayer so all of you have had as i have all of you had what does this sister need indeed seriously because this is serious it is silly really serious but the song where have you reached brother isaac where have you reached 171 okay that's nice uh-huh sam where have you reached 122. okay that's good sister sarah where have you reached for me to hear what you're saying you have to unmute yourself fast yes i mean you got me an uncatch edge 177. oh that's very good that's very good okay hey hey sister john where are you where have you reached are you pleased with yourself you tell us why you agreed so john where have you reached in this reading if you're reading at all that's right did i hear you correctly okay uh i hope you said one other and further too that is money that means that uh i see your network is not very good as usual uh maybe you have changed location uh but if you are not hearing make sure you hear us so you are sitting in a place where you can be able to hear well okay so who have i not asked that i need to ask brother paulica where are you 115. so you have been asleep at this time you have been reading slower slowly you've been reading other books oh you finished adoption not yet i saw they were seriously they they took two books and they're gonna finish it in one night that's that is it i love that uh brother marvin where have you reached 110 okay now it seems in the political that's where you reached where are you you are that's one of the things so which means you you are just on this man okay but uh you should have done better than that right how far the brothership you are better quiet as if you approached the world but how far have you gone 119. 119 because you already wished so there are others that have not finished completed the second chapter even on the invasion church age they've been reading other books so those of you have not even you know finished you know this chapter i think we all have only one among us you can now see that we are really left behind that is not acceptable our local down is about to get over and uh i do not know if we shall continue to get such a chance to study like this of course when lockdown is over we we we we're going to go but some of you are going to go back to schools and uh you're going to go back into another atmosphere and maybe you you may even put your chat edit book on under the pillow that is if you go with it you know others may even forget where you have thrown it so really i am suggesting and proposing that you you use make use of your time as a matter of fact you if i were you i wouldn't even do what brother o'kara suggested for to us to read according to proportion i would read the whole book finish it and then come back and then be reading whichever part we're going to be covering at that time you understand so by the time you go to school you have nothing to lose you have finished the whole book and you have already asked all your questions that you need to ask and you know what you really believe you've had a strong sister will sing that song or do you want me to play it again the tears you will cry again when you are you are left from the rapture you cry them now you cry them now time is is coming when people will cry those years time is coming when those people will now will now say oh god let me be spiritual let me say all the world oh god i've now remembered i have to really be serious with you oh lord even if it is reading the church edible if all i have to do is read the church to go the rapture let me do it at least in 72 hours long or even at least in two to two hours i can do it i can make it i'm sure you know those prayers cannot help you at that time because the rapture will already happen so please let us be serious use your time when you have it don't you know don't wait when it is too late this message is not for the for the people out there this message is for us there are people out there who don't know even this message but whatever you know they have really studied it they have really learned it they really know it too well that you believe the message don't even know what you believe but yet they know what they believe because the younger people are too lazy the other people are too weak i tell you that i'm sorry to speak in this way but generally speaking young people in the message they are too lazy to read a message too lazy then you wonder if the our fathers who came in before us were also lazy like us would we even be having anyone to preach to us anymore do you know you are the preachers of a few years to come into our terrace so how are you going to be preaching and telling others to read when you yourself never read it it's going to be a shame it's going to be a shame so i'm encouraging you to take this serious read the message seriously be sincere i remember when i was still in school i saw this someone here who did what i did i i would take a friend this friend of mine did not even believe the message at that time i would take him we go somewhere i tell him you know what i have something very sweet that i want to read for you i'll just read about you only two pages and then we can now revise the books so we would go this would of course be now after our preps so we have to sleep but now instead of selecting i'll tell you before we sleep let us go and read up these two pages we will take message books like i remember there is a message book we do titled why are we not at the nomination that one i'll never forget it so i took it and i told him let me read because i wanted him to see the differences of what i believe and the the the church he was in so i started reading when i finished the first page i went on the second on the last page which is the second page i promise that i'll read only two pages and by the time i finish the second independently you know what please continue i said okay no problem i continued i i i opened i kept on flick flipping the pages that he was him telling me my that is nice continuously god anointed me in such a way that i was reading it and he was so sweet in his yeah so he joined me please continue a bit continue and preach and guess what we think we want to finish the church in the on only one night about two hours i'm not the church but why are we not that denomination we will finish it just like that because the thing was true that we continued reading reading reading you know if you cannot read listen if your tune is reading some people are not good at reading you can listen you know we have all these things on top many of you have messaged prayers even those who don't have someone who has so at least put that thing on and listen okay listen where you are you know why they are following you know me i love listening i put on and then i just follow you know you see and then when i want to analyze something or just to reason on something i underline it i have to pause the play the tape and then i listen i i first think and and you know study it very well then i play again i continue listening are you please are you concentrating here yes so friends what am i saying you should be serious about this issue this is this case it's a serious case it's a serious matter praise the name of the lord so if we take it serious trust me you will get out of it much more than you expected that you will ever get out hallelujah amen we have uh sister peace also there on the on the uh sister base uh i would like to know if this is a just following or if they are also really which stuff is someone reminding me yes okay sister face are you there how how much have you read uh are you about to speak to us we would like to know if you have been reading also or you have not been reading you know sister sharon also please tell us animate yourself and tell us okay are they hearing me or they have not been reading and they are inside into new to themselves and they also switch up their videos and sister now lego sharon would like to know i know is this a sister in the uae hey what is this sister yes she is he's the one yeah sister charon and we would like to know whether you have been reading the church edge book and how much i'm doing where are you now before we go into the discussions okay so shadow and sister peace uh not talking you will have to find out brother either now or later so that we know whether we are following or not praise the name of the lord can we now start reading and discussing i did not get any questions brother okay there is a question that you say that was asked i i lost track of that question i do not have it anywhere near me so you have to forward it to me in my private whatsapp number okay now i'd like us to proceed with where we start where did we stop yeah i really the name man so we were still in the introduction the ethereum okay okay who is the beginning of the reading okay can you that brother for me so that you can meanwhile you can start brother now let us be very careful that we are not confused at this point thus will seek the wife to validate this claim let us go back to the book of the beginning genesis in the garden of eden there are two trees one was good one was evil one produced life that have produced death there are two children who ordinarily go let me repeat that they both offered sacrifices to god genesis 4 3-5 and in the process of time it came to pass that came brought to the front of the ground right on the fast floor of his floor and the fact they are wrong and alone had respect and to abel and jesus came and she is offering he had no respect but one which is k was evil [Music] the same parents they were the twins of isaac one was the elect of god and the other was your prophet both worshiped one in every single case there was worship of god involved in every case the demolition the writers and persecuted the writers in some cases that they would destroy their ideas but notice they were planted together they live together they both made claims upon whether not okay now before we continue i uh i'd like to ask a question amen sister [Applause] i was going to ask to call the other name but i know i always mess it up so sister burgers how much have you read yo have you finished this ma the efficient age okay now i would like to ask a question to all of us all of you yes uh how can you remember why the church edge book is different from all the other message books we have yes go ahead uh okay since you're already in the highlight yeah because the prophet you also tried to put up your voice a bit the prophet allowed other people to correct the vocabulary and to edit it is that expressed perfectly this is stuff this is uh uh uh this is a question that says no so you you want to tell us why why the touch edge book is different from all the other messaging books we have um brother are you if this uh highlighted people were always going to talk so you understand their needs perhaps okay but yes brother son because keeps adding the chain putting some passes and vocabulary but that one is not a perfect explanation it's the same thing that brother polycarp said but it's not a perfect explanation yes not that i'm not i'm not appreciating it but i'm i'm saying that it's more missing more to say okay yes brother joe yeah okay now you're coming but what they're saying what can you say about it what they say yes what they were already answering do you have anything you want to say about it no ok dragon is yes we are not uh saying no but also that answer i we need to spice it up a little bit because when you just say someone edited it's like as if someone came and put their own ideas uh so yes brother and where do you get that from so you mean you do not need the regulation of the whole speed when you are dealing with the rest of the message books so did he also write the rest of the messages that's the part about what i was looking for okay we are coming back to that but uh people hold it there but i love it you have something else you want to say elaborated more is to underline the parts which are which have questions and the prophet he sat down and tried to explain those parts which are and so can you compare this church edible with the rest of the messaging books that we have that's that was the initial question how different is it from the other message books so did brother also write the other books yes okay yes yes can you can you also give me your submission write them brother he was recognized just transcribed into the platform but yeah but about the title he read to reference to put the language straight into a language that the land people would all right now the last two people including all of you have given us some substantial information i would like to say this again that we can understand because sometimes we we forget to understand what this is all about you have this church right yes brother banham was not educated as we all might think he was a seventh grade student so he was not a doctor of theology don't expect him to start going to write books he never did write books he actually never did maybe he's attract he wrote some quite a bit earlier in his years i don't remember the title but it was about divine healing and things like that all the message books we have can you give me some samples oh you don't even know yeah come on give me give me okay there is this one why it had to be shepherd give me another come on yeah you can see already people are really doing quite a lot of business and reading okay this the other one that one this one was printed can you bring one that we do here this one was printed by uh uh by uh brother oh i'm forgetting the name about in south africa over there in south africa is that who printed this and uh they just said this recently okay then this one was created by voice of god recordings everlasting life and how to receive it you see then this one also splits by voice of god recordings absorption it seems this is a series of messages and there is something that uh i'd like someone to read for me you see this yes what's going behind there this is the first time for [Music] from the map from the magnetic check recordings to the printed page and are printed here in and updated and distributed by the voice of god means it is not changed it's not touched what was spoken on the magnetic tape what was preached on verbal it is exactly what was put there that's why the other daughter said it is a transcription it's all right a transcription you don't change anything just like the things i'm speaking now you record it and then you you sit down you hear me talking and you write what i will say what are these messenger books these ones we do here all these messaging books you know are transcriptions of the words of the preaching that balabana was preaching that's why when you say i want to read inspiration with which he gave this message why number one he preached this message probably in one hour and a half or even less this one message and here you take it and listen and read it for one month you read one page you keep you read one page you keep you will never get the inspiration you need to sit down and play the team the best for you to understand and get the inspiration you need to sit down play that tape and not brother but listen and say i will continue listening now tomorrow no if you're in a service do you work out no are you kidding me yes what are you doing in a service you sit down you listen to the service you say amen you take your nuts you get up after you've been blessed so in the same way these messages are preached and not always let it be a culture you know that whenever you're going to read a message you give yourself time okay don't pick one big move and so i'm going to read this one now and finish it no depending on the time you have you planned yourself this morning i don't have much time about one hour or so in the morning what i'll pick a small book perhaps maybe like a everlasting life and how to receive it this is quite small you can read it within a one hour or less okay how many can do that okay how many can read in 30 minutes look you can wait too fast but maybe when you're not understanding also yes it is good to read if you preach it for one hour and a half since it is ready you can read it for two hours or an hour about 40 minutes you understand yes in order for you to fully understand what it is that is being propagated but if you are listening you listen for exact time he was preaching what are you saying is better because when you listen you receive more it's always good to listen i better listen yes see every page is under oh my i love this don't you have it let's look at that just look at that every page is on the right oh i just love this now is it before i put on an ipad that's how i used to do also in my books but nowadays i have ipad i just highlight them you know technology is improving every time but we we just the issue is listen and read the message that's the most important thing okay success love this brother is very very serious oh my the whole book is nothing with his brain which means which means that oh most of these things are written in that [Music] [Music] he has written in his book and exposition he has already preached if you want to hear those messages he preached he he we but in each message he was dealing with with the with the one thing one thing one thing you understand but now when it comes to the church edible it's not only does someone's edited in perfect grammar grammar okay not everything the teaching but everything there rama please hold that in your heart not only is the grammar edited but also new teachings are put in this booklet that we are not in those original preached summons when i said mutations i don't mean like he knew that from the teaching of alabama but actually i mean that they're teaching their speech to earth like the serpent's seat yes he if now he's the one who are healing me that's why i wanted us to i understand this because you'll be like we are starting to church ages now how does the supremacy become here you have to understand like the suffering see like about one god yeah you understand so many of these teachings are incorporated in this book and actually all the majorities of the message are in here so if someone says why do people believe giving this book if he's a serious person if he reads it you will know everything we believe if you read it you will know everything you preach yes by the way let me tell you never call yourself a message if you don't know what the message preaches the whole thing not some of it the whole thing me when i believe the message i was on fire to know everything that they wanted to preach everything i was in my church and they talk about the rapture like this what does the message say about the rapture i was there and they talked about the three four six what does the message say about triple six do you understand i was there and they said they were saying i was there and they were telling us to come before the priest and we confess our sins what does the message say about how is it called in in english that confession is this really confession the sacrament is called one itself no no no no no no no no yes yeah yes you see what was the message you know i i was there and they told uh you know these are how they uh you know how many know about evolution evolution er different evolution what does the theory of the evolution mistake is animals wow and and then what happened how come they're human beings now it's it continues on huh what until now we became perfect human beings so through the fives how many of you are teaching how many did not know hey that is what i was teaching did you know that i know you i think you are a statistician [Music] and slowly by slowly the tail broke off slowly by slowly this thing kind of broke off with the defector the fat the fires broke over there and the horns also brought off and then eventually the that that was their conclusion but what does the message say about that if it is the editorial message it must have a final conclusion let me tell you if this message we are preaching is the end time message it must have a conclusion on every major matter in the world for your information you know why because the end time prophet will be sent by god fulfill revelation 10 and 7. what does it say without reading you of course from the beginning but uh-huh yes brother but in the days but in the days of the voice he says the mystery of girls god bless you hallelujah what is the mystery of god the mystery of god is god himself what he has hidden within him right the mystery of god is the mystery of his will and the mystery of god is the word itself and a veil everything that was never understood every question that man has ever had the the last day prophet the end time you wrap the key to unlock all those mysteries hallelujah and uh yes yes have we heard this message yes have we believed this message why because this message at the is of god yes the conclusion of god before he takes the break in the night so talk any type of topic you want to talk about let me hear your topics one water baptism the conclusion is in the message marriage yes it is amazing that the youngest is not to talk about you but marriage the conclusion is in the message yes trinity the conclusion is right here [Music] yes i tell you don't ever think that you will get something in the message and something's out of the message if you are that kind you may not last in this message salvation all that you need to be prosperous in this life and to be prosperous in the world to come is in this message if the message is the word of god then everything we need is right there what is the message here's what i always say what is your bible you know okay oh yes yes sister i can see you oh she said you don't have my bible what is your ass please hold it up someone is holding up a black book do you know all the denominations have bibles yes so why do you think you are different from them [Music] [Music] this message is a higher regulation than what is in the denominations but they also have the same do you know now you with this variable you will also understand if you have a problem with your eyes and the difference is too big that you remove your eye glasses as much as you have your bible can you read it very well can you why because you need to apply [Music] you need to apply glasses when your progress is you are comfortable number one number two you can see where number three you can drink you can read and you can know you understand yes so now the message this book we are starting these books we are reading the topics we are hearing is the ideas when you don't have it you can't even get your bibles because if you you don't have anything because you can't understand it but when you bring the message you read through it it is going to be your filter now to be able to understand the message and people the problem they have leaving the life of this message is because when they were in the denominations there they were reading the bible in the filter of the of those denominational teachings so when you now give them the message it is very hard for them why because they think that is still those things maybe if they were in the world or they did not know the lord or the word or they were catholic so they were you understand so when you whenever you read a scripture for them they may even shout a man but actually they are shouting a man to the that they had the understanding that they absolutely think that they have but thank god when we come to this knowledge of the truth we receive another filter the filter of the world which is god himself because this message is christ himself coming down because remember that star was in his hands you know and it is him who is giving life to that star so that that right can illuminate us also so that we can be able to understand what god wants us to understand so we can be able to see what god wants us to see can we now go back to the church having understood all goals then now we can be able to know speak of all these things in uh you know uh and right here now he's talking about kane and the aber and kenji that wicked one and he says that uh again there are two children from the flesh of the saint parents uh for some reason you're not giving me those buses but isaac but uh i think you were meant to and there were two children from the from of this the same parents they were the twins of isaac and rebecca and one under one was the elect of god and the other was both worshiped god in every single case there was worship of god involved in every case the evil hated the writers and persecuted the righteous in in some cases the evil destroyed the righteous but not just they were granted together they lived only foreign do you know that even if any prophets are going to make a claim of god do you know that they will make a claim of god but that does not necessarily mean that god is actually hearing or respecting their suffering his uh their sacrifices okay who is reading the next paragraph these illustrations depict perfectly this illustration perfectly the parable of the lord jesus christ when he said that the kingdom of heaven was like until a man who sowed good saved only to have an enemy come and plant tears amongst amongst those good sins what did not plant that certain plantations there's right amongst the good seeds of food those two kinds of plants in tobacco's people from two different seeds grew up together they particularly the nourishment in the same earth they shared in the same sign and all other benefits and both harvested in their time do you see it don't ever forget these truths as we study the church edges and later they say hallelujah did you get the point the major point there before before did you get another point there what's the major point your salvation please what is happening in that chapter you are sitting very very fast today huh i don't know why uh-huh what what's happening okay and what happens after that yes the two different states grew together uh-huh come on now i need someone else to give a know what do i understand by that question but they all receive the same rain and everything but what is different is the word but they all receive that same everything and go together okay now what when you say they all receive the same everything and go together what do they receive we might fail to understand he was talking about seeds and he says that they also these illustrations depict perfectly the parable of the lord jesus christ when he said that the kingdom of heaven was like a man who so would sit only to have an enemy come and plant stairs amongst those good seats where did not plant the tears saturn planted downstairs right amongst the good sea of gold those two kind there's two kinds of plants before from two different seeds grow up together how many types of plants two that was followed by in the same earth you know this is the spiritual language now yes yeah those ones who did not love math here it goes back again to math because you have to know what stands for x stands for this and y stands for this so you have to understand this spiritual language someone would read these things he's talking about his sins it's not about chaos it's talking about that i can't understand these things it's not confusing even as a matter of fact i even feel headache in this thing why because you are not tuned because you are not entered into the spirit you remember we talked about where you need the spirit so if you want to understand these things you have to be entered into the spirit of real fast yes before you start even reading it so what is talking about the seeds one was burnt by god those are the one people the seed of god right yes and then another one was planted right yes so that that seed also was there so we we now have god is sin and sabbath stop and see so now by the way this fact people some people they don't believe many christians don't believe this they don't even know others but in this world we have something to see that god is saying believe what you want to believe but that's the truth we have observancy okay now the towers are the serpent seed the good seed are the seed of god now these both partake of the same nourishment in the same house you will find those even those who cannot see any christianity they will be in the same church or the same christianity now you call that the earth okay the soil where they are planted it is the atheist the church so we are looking at the two findings they share the same sun one sun here s-u-n what is here do you like math so yeah you are now confused but actually you don't need to know math you already need to connect in the spirit so the s-u-n here means s-o-n the sun means the sun give it to me that beautiful one oh yes give it to me right here i want to demonstrate something for everyone here to see you see this beautiful flower as much as it is beautiful it will die if it has not so it will need water and the light so what does this hallelujah look you say like i've planted this beautiful flower here if this was a garden you will find also other weeds growing from in a year and enjoying the same light but in this case future we're talking about the right of the overworld oh he says [Applause] jesus [Applause] oh [Music] jesus [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] jesus [Music] civil rights that we need the son of jesus the son of god amen that we need is the same word that those tales will also meet they the submarine the second order this thing needs the same water that we don't need in that case rain is a symbolic to the straight spirit of carrying off the spirit you know just like a plant needs both water and sun we do [Applause] the spirit so now you when you receive the holy ghost you are the true child of god you will speak in times you will speak in but also out there they will also speak anyone so somebody is right and who is wrong they spoke entirely and you spoke in terms until some believers don't believe in speaking times anymore because the other spoken times it's just like uh i i i'm amazed saying ah me i'm not going to i'm not going to bear fruits anymore because these cocoa bears are also bearing fruits let them bear me uh can i [Applause] um [Music] but [Music] my god help me so i can just for you something when you when you receive give them the word the body will come to them the holy spirit will come to them but they will bring salt of their kindness [Music] the same spirit that matures you to be a perfect son of god is the same spirit which will take them even further away from god [Music] is planted it has two things two major parts of it it has the the amaze how is it coming which looks like this is it how is it called the whole thing how is it called a flower no this is a flower it has got a shark i don't think the shark even had amazing projects we understand they will receive the same son that means you will receive the same sound so whether it may receive the same song you that as a matter of fact as long as it rejoices it will not be there with a shot it will not be there with the sea the seed can never be healed you understand yes when the the rain of the holy ghost comes down the serpent seed will rejoice after the same anointing that you as a seed of god will reduce under so don't ever be deceived by the rejoicing everyone will rejoice don't prophesy they will dream dreams they will have gifts and they will have signs and learners all of them among them actually don't fear because they have them but fear because you don't have them actually fear don't fear because they have they have those things don't fear because they have the manifestation but fear because you don't have the manifestation i mean what i'm saying yes when you say i don't know why i want to continue down i'm like stuck here because maybe someone needs to understand something look if you see on the other side for instance uh uh two plants and this you know they were all almost dying like that and then it rained and the other one slowly started to come out and the incident you just rejoice under that water and this beautiful sun and the other remains like that what do you say sister you are not because so what's happening it is dying right yes so the church without the manifestation of the spirit is dying is that they try to regardless of what what they call themselves even if they call themselves believers are you hearing me even if they call themselves but if there is no manifestation of the spirit that church is dead the manifestation of the holy spirit shows the life of the spirit and then that spirit of god if you are a seed of god it will bring forth out of you that life of god because you are a ceo but to them it will not bring for that life because they are not so they only bring forth who they are yes if you give water to uh to uh you know like you know they started the eagle sister basically that story last time you know that you know she was hatched under they eat their cheeks but it ended up a you know as much as you all look the same at the same food and everything but while they were eating from the time when they were very small as they grew as they grew each was showing their own characters yes so as you are here in this world you will end up doing your god so let us pray that you are all going to be the character of christ which is in you before the foundation of the world did you answer that point yes can you do it that it is in this last edge when the chairs are getting burned for their burning that they will solve out the wheat that is to be garnered by the lord i want to carry this salt all the way through so let us go a step further have you ever studied the history of revivals now the revivals now it never fails in the days of the great welsh revival and there was a great display of the devil power to take away the attention from god it's written that in wesley's day the people would not the people the most for peculiar things that would definitely also try to mock the goodness of the power quote in luther's days it said that the miracle of his means she did not claim the fact that he successfully produced the roman catholic church but the miracle play in the fact she could indeed stay sound and sing amidst the fanatics who are often filled with and guided by wrong spirits and if you have been aware of this last ministry you will have noted the same inversion of false and wicked spirits it has to be that way now i hope and trust you are spiritual minded enough to get that and capitalize on it just still responding the true and false veins mainly and demonstrating the two spirits that are at work let us look into first john chapter four one one to four and jude chapter three chapter [Music] let's revivals in something that uh usually happens in every revival because this same thing is happening in our bible today go ahead we i think let me invite you to this reading from where it says that saturn is there okay it says and every time god moves starting with that it never fails so it really shows us that it's taking us about also oh i'm going to show you something there is always someone to oppose so and that person is in a form of a spirit and their security that tries and that person is with you only okay cannot be in you at times but and be that okay that comes for instance when there is a revival that is starting and those will come to persecution or discourage you that's what i can say is also moving if you break you down and bring your thoughts you can't manage it no one is listening to you okay yes you'll be that is what i can say as far as when god moves i suddenly lose and you always have to know that it will never fail yes even if when you okay for instance this message we've always met people who tell us the way they sing their cold blood day personally i've had people who are minorities who tell me that following a man so they may try if you're not very punctual if you don't know what to do you may you know fail it comes by yes a development will start in your mind changing you from where you are trying to take into account i mean something that i wrote it down again that i wanted to system yes something that i wanted to say okay it's giving me something here okay as you are continuing this is uh that way explaining i want to say it's if the spirit of the devil the spirit of god the spirit of the devil can either impersonate or try to mimic can either mimic or or oppose any opposite or basically today what the the true spirit is bring it can either oppose or join but to bring the shame at the end of the the end of the the end of the day example sometimes you may have a revival in the church whereby some people can speak the tanks and others in the parade or some others prophesy but you find that availability can be interpreting the tanks and visa is a gay or is a is a fornicator so the devil wants this when this fornication will be revealed now they will result of their holy spirit to be there of the devil are you getting me yes the devil will come either either to put a shame or to persecute he can persecute whatever the holy spirit is doing or try to to be under the influence of the same spirit but at the end of the day the wicked will be revealed then the devil will see their own banjo was of the devil [Music] anyway you know by the way friends this is quite a very very important thing especially during our time where we're living i'm pleasing your attention all of you you see that uh god god works in his people in every generation we are only looking at the official church agent we will be able to see but i want you to understand that whenever there is a move of god the devil also moves and like father i was saying and brother o'carroll to try what is the purpose listen to this please what's the purpose to try and describe what god is doing to end up saying to to make it feel as if what god was doing was not really credible what god was doing was not really that big a big deal you understand the devil has always wanted to discredit the move of god always and he has given us an example here that in the day of vu he says in the day it is that in his day the people who do most peculiar things that were definitely of saturn you know in joining within this day this was the time when god was moving in power another time of revival and this was the time that missionaries were going all over people are loving one another that's preaching holiness and love are you following me yes yes and uh this were that was the time that uh also the same time that the devil tried to make the people do very very different or strange things that were observed what was the purpose to try and move the goodness and power of god and then he said also in ruler's day it is said that the miracle of the of the ministry of luther was not because he protested the roman catholic church but the miracle was that he was able to stay sane to stop sober you know in the right direction uh regardless of uh is a fanatic is someone who i would i prefer to present this way a fanatic is someone who believes something and goes overboard any other yes a fanatic is someone who over believes something and it's like you've often seen people who say that they are in the spirit i don't know if i should say this let me let me say this we have seen people and i will not give examples from outside the message but i i will have i will give uh an example within the confines of the believers of this message sometimes you find you form groups that tend to say they accept the holy spirit but they tend also to go overboard you know you've seen we've had moments whereby a preacher can preach and no one is even able to hear what the preacher is saying but okay you know what i'm talking about and uh why because everyone is shouting at the same time with the preacher also preaching preaching the word so then you often wonder which one what is right because imagine a pitcher is preaching a point like right now i'm preaching a point you're all listening right yes but now for them to claim that they're in the spirit i'm preaching and this one is also shouting on top of this place and also running up coming here to meet me at the other side almost everyone is going to put it all shouting almost even carrying me to the you know you know and it's like confusion in the church that's to me it's like fanaticism you know you know it's you know the preacher is preaching and you are you are rolling on the floor you know you're running you know this church you know they accept the manifestation of the spirit and all that but you say they give them enough time to pray and to you know when it comes time for him to teach now of course he has preaching sessions and when it is a teaching station he tells the people i want you sober okay i want you to be sober like all of you are sober right now sit down and here and now there's a sister who are still in this spirit okay shouting and praying you know and she was distracted everybody was from hearing what was going so the pastor stopped and he said sister he called her name said sister can you please go back to your seat and let me know also minister my that takes now huh it's like someone said oh you're broke the floor of the spirit but the pastor put the sister in order just like uh paul has told us if we are going to have times to be spoken in the church not everyone is going to speak at the same time you understand yes if everyone speaks times at the same time it will bring confusion and not edification to the church why the others are like fanatics why because they do not observe or even believe in the order of the operation of the gifts in the church but in the message you know to strike this balance to text the grace of god because many have thought that they are striving to strike the balance and they end up becoming also one you know it's aggressing people who are in the spirit and you know breaking anointing and you know by saying that we believe in order does not also mean we don't believe in the flow and manifestation of the spirit yes you understand what i'm saying you know we believe in praying in times we believe in prophesying we believe in the same vision to believe in shouting in the church oh you guys you just raised up your hands but you didn't even shout at all and you said you believe it do you believe in shouting in chat i feel like as if i'm not in the right place maybe i'm in a you say much of the way your friends very quiet things even even if you you are allowing the person when you mean brother you know you will be quiet not enough that you are paid but that you are you know among the dead so in other words what i'm saying is our churches should not be more chinese because we believe the message [Music] god that level of balance sometimes it takes the grace of god right it takes the grace of god but what i'm going to be trying to explain here is that in the days of jerusalem for example around the days of uh uh for example what he had to fight and to read through was fanaticism what is fanaticism these are people on tour that would go and begin breaking the uh because they were producing the catholic church right so they would go and get the idols before they tried to go there wrong adultery we are not against the people that preached our doctrine you get a problem so i'm not going to talk about the beginning you know what i'm saying i'm saying you're not an evangelistic message so i begin crushing them and putting their names i'm behaving like a fanatic right because i think it's like i am holier than that it's a holier-than-thou you know so sometimes you find it i often also see that when i believe by the way i believe in you know in getting drunk in the spirit you can even sometimes roll on the floor and shout and you know whatever the whole spirit comes in you can't control those states you know it's like you are in the spirit but i also believe that the spirit of god is ordered okay you're not going to break all the chairs in the chat because you were in this field okay so really some people become fanatics you know you grab the chair and it was because you were in your spirit really then a lot of time you you said that in lures they said that the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protested but that the mirror connected the fact that he could and he did stay around and send i mean it's the fanatics it's it needs to say sound sorry it is the sound and send sen means what you know in the right mental attitude in the right mental uh understanding a medius in the middle of the fanatics who were often filled with and guided by wrong spirits so somehow so in our generation today the unit is the same thing now please this is very sensitive and you must hear me and understand me very well what we see among the pentecostalism today the so-called metaphors dependent [Applause] when you ask this person why did you you know sometimes they even it's the preacher was pushing on them and then before that and then they kind of said it was the spirit you know what are these things they hear these things are here because they have to discourage what god is doing among the members of the bride yes the holy spirit is moving and wanting to move in great power in the members of the bride with the members of the true church of the true we are fighting to sleep down here but that true vine that the first fight is trying to come in and describe it the true vibe so that when the people see it they will say ah i won't be afraid [Music] so that now people will fear they will say i will not associate myself with us they never thought that that would hinder the true move of god but you can never hear the true move of god because the true vine in every direction will always be steered and focused on purpose and they will be aligned to the right the right way the right way but what will somehow hold them and put them in the right path to be able to overcome the uh all the fanaticism and all the uh of the generation so you see all the false prophets in our generation the false prophets the false christ the falsehood man of god here man of god money man of god everywhere almost every road on every street that is meant to do what to know what god is doing so right now i will say i saw you you you know i was there you know that telling them how about a banana was designing because one was one of the medications they are like even in here whenever someone ever comes to you and says that they are prophet or their pastor their man of god can design i want you to remind them two things i'm going to give this equipment to you now number one no man since the days of jesus christ has had a discernment ministry like that of badavana it only seems to be in the name of jesus christ until the prophet of malachi for the virgin tense that's when it happened i'm not talking about the designate of the spirits i'm talking about resentment of the heart to where to the extent that that woman had to run until the people come and see a man who was talking to me the things i did in my heart is that this is the messiah so what jesus did show the heart that this was the ministry of the promised messiah the minister of alabama was in fulfillment of group 17 and [Music] the ministry of the messiah again in our generation jesus christ manifested himself in flesh in a ministry of a prophet on earth one thing tell them that it does never happen again what does that what i mean it has never happened before what does that mean of course before you get affected what do you have [Music] come number one number two their ministries when they say that they have designment of their ad it's not true why because all of us who are afraid to have it it fails at one point and they tell things which are right right right right and then finally they tell one which is wrong another which is wrong but all through the midst of that gift it has never told anything that it was wrong it is all recorded on death not not one like this i said not one like this that was ever wrong or discredited at any time what does it show you that was the real deal okay so but anyways people today have you know many i have powering the anointing and things like that so now it is meant to move and to try and blind the people's eyes from the reality but they should have got their eyes a little bit divine from the reality are you following me okay can you read one [Music] [Music] they are of god because many universe prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye the first prophet is [Music] eat with the world of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world judy foreign when i give all delegates to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you episode to you that you should honestly condemn for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints but there are certain men tripped in unawares these have come into into the fall by means of the dog and there are four robbers who where before or fall ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the rest of our word into last graciousness and denying that only lord god our lord jesus christ these are spots in your fists of charity when they face with you feeding themselves without fear cannot be denied the first of these scriptures that the true church and the first church are in that queen having been planted together but of different things they and until today the true church and the false church are intertwined they are together you cannot almost separate them okay let us continue now then i think there is something else you ought to know the seven churches which are addressed by young are in asia minor and are all gender churches he does not speak to the church at jerusalem which was mostly jewish with perhaps just a few gentiles in it the reason is that god had turned from the jews to the gentiles thus the world of the child's ages is god dealing with the gentiles and calling out a gentile bride to himself that makes the church edges and the fullness of the gentiles the one and the same thing acts chapter 13 verse 44 48 and and the next sabbath they came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god but when they used solemn attitudes they were filled with enemies and sparked against those things which were spoken before contradicting and just blessed family it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life no down to million times for so hard the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the youngest that thou should best be for salvation unto the earth of the earth and when the gentiles had this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were then life believed from the gender dispensation now you will know where i'm coming from in the videos series of the data dispensation now so uh but i wanna let's just look at that last paragraph there now when i think that something else you want to know the seven churches which are addressed by jonah in asia minor and are all gendered chances all of them yes the general churches it doesn't speak to the church of jerusalem which was mostly jewish with perhaps just a few genders in it the reason is that god had turned from the jews to the gentiles that's the one of the church ages is god dealing with there and calling out agenda to himself now you remember he does also deal with the jews but the jews have their time running when he deals the difference between you and gentiles let me ask three people two uh two sisters two brothers brothers let us begin with you what's the difference between gentiles is [Music] okay perfectly safe yes the next one sisters do you agree with what these young men are saying what do you know about this [Music] okay so what the land use well not in israel so it is right now as a country that is not non-jews not a person from israeli so what's that now and so god does not deal with that at the same time and their timing is in the seven in 70 weeks and the hours is fitted in now by grace within the period of the jews there has been four hours to be put on so theirs is cut off they are cut off for us to be grafted in so we can now see that we are in this digress hallelujah tell your brothers you are into this by grace [Music] the seven stars in his right hand who walkers in the midst of the seven golden thunder stages i know they looks i know they work and they live and their patience and how the cannot bear them which are equal so if some of you are you are finding difficult in reading that you can even read like this i know your works your labor your patience i also know how you cannot bear them which i give you right okay continue and now let's spread them which say they are apostle and a note and as found them less and as born and as an as patients and for their name sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have i have somewhat again against thee because thou has left their first love remember therefore from from whence thou had fallen and repent and do and do the first words or else i will i will come unto thee quickly and will remove that kind of stick out of his place except though repaint but this door has that though it is the deeds all of us together now that is the message point number one that's the message that you phrase and church age it to the message of the presidential age this is all embedded in regulation chapter 2 verses one two to seven now straight away we're going to go into the next sub-topic there to learn about the messenger of discharge age okay uh i know you already read this so can someone please explain that first paragraph without having to read it yes touch your hands with brother polycarp you want to do that please famous and messenger saying that the refugee church h was paul and paul was actually at first which is the jews but then we just recognized the previous uh paragraph sets he told the dude that god has told us now to talk to the gentiles and the first gentile church was the church at emphasis if you don't take it uh and now he was pretty good about stretch so i think just for that can you say it is poor what authority do you have to say this boy why not peter what the what imagine you are meeting a friend and you say and your friends okay show it to us if huh okay but it's in uh page 71 second program and sister john will be very very attentive because i'm coming back [Music] they came almost the whole city of together but when the jews saw them all jesus they were filled with envy and what did they wear actually okay but when they just saw their mouth suits they were filled with envy and spread against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming then paul and barnabas was bold said it doesn't necessarily the god of god should first should first have been spoken to you but seeing it put it from you and that your soul is another life no we turn to the gentiles who would have commanded us let me stop there but uh what i can actually tell someone that paul finished that part definition yeah that fast would you have that the yes should be for salvation until the end of the earth and when the gentiles had these girls lord and glorified the word of the lord and as many were ordained eternal life believed yeah i finished reading okay but actually it's okay yeah explain to us paul had the authority to say this and also the other thing which i which i like from it is that uh the jews said what paul was talking was contradicting and blaspheming and most of the things which the jews were doing would actually change their living because now the things like eating they had their own culture and stuff so it changed most of them and starts falling and by now you will think that your sdf plane is convinced then then maybe if it tells me to speed up and i remember one time we talked about when peter and paul actually were arguing about some things then would show peter at what write it down after you finish go check it out is it in the bible with the message once your eyes is there oh you will now use it also once your house is not there come back to me but faster you say this what is it what is it in before you really run around with something you have to ensure that it is in the world can someone read from romans 11 13 because that one is direct to the point so we can now authoritatively say paul was the apostle to the gender that's what i'm about yes he saw no money but he did but they led him by their hand and brought him into the massacres and he was eight days without sight and neither did no break and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called strange and inquire in the house of judas for one gold star of justice for behold he prayed and he and have seen a vision a man named coming in and looking at his hand from him that he might receive his sight then anonymous answer lord i have heard by many of this man how much people have done here we have authority from the chief priests combined all that fall from thy name but the lord said that i wait for he is the chosen verse of one to me to bear my name before the gentiles [Music] ah no one can doubt it no one can do it okay uh someone can you wait for me that a paragraph there after romans 11 paul founded the church at ephesus all right this enables us to set the date for the beginning [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] do you read anyway in the bible it's unfortunate do you have a bible church it's a place do you have a right where do you see that in the bible friends [Music] all come on someone someone no one oh no one can try even okay someone can try [Music] give it to me here chapter 19. ah obama said me equations one one what does efficiency one one say sorry your brother um are professors and to their faith jesus hallelujah that one is good he writes to the ephesians but not necessarily saying that he started go ahead and give me that class you're pleased okay can you read [Music] [Music] yes but not in the new testament well i believe as following after the faith of repentance only john's ministry okay continuity brother that's he said unto them have been received was sincere believed and they said unto him we have not so much as hearts whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them and to what then were he baptized and they said unto john's baptism then saint paul john really baptized you the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they had this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and so is the beginning of the ephesians church these things were right they were in ephesians yes paul found them fought with them further praised them paul prayed for them right the people are not necessarily only 12 about not necessarily only about 12 but the bible says maybe it means the main you know we do not know maybe they never measured the sisters and and the other you know so perhaps they were more than 12. yes but we know that the first chapter that uh were about twice the first started was at the ephesus and these were started by poor so about the middle of the first century have you seen where it starts yes okay now he said what those means we have a three-four equality three qualities now the way we have overstayed on this efficient chart age is because we are also making a foundation for all the others so the first we set a sequence for us even for the next strategies and the messengers and everything so paul was absolutely true to the world that's the first point he never deviated from it no matter what the cost paul never left the world never developed from the world paul never compromised the word sir was exactly true to the world you can see those next scriptures i'm sure you read them where it says if any man preach another gospel and what you have preached even if it is let them be cast even if it's an angel from heaven this word of god [Music] because it's like man can change his word at any time i'm sorry we mean that you see but god cannot change his words yes because god cannot repent what he says first is perfect even before he says it hallelujah so the word of god can never be changed whatever was told by the apostles including paul can never [Applause] [Music] [Applause] each of you should be a member in a certain church a place where you go and you play your wrath you are right some of you don't even know what it is we shall teach you about that and some of you are babies in christ i'm sure so we have to teach on that so when you you have your families you have your rights where you belong where you come from all right even the church of christ should be that with the believers you shouldn't just be here where you are whatever happens i have decided that this is my own church what you know that is a joke of course you can visit anywhere else but you know i belong here yes my life i paid here uh when i need prayer or whatever this one is my pastor i i look after him i look at him for leadership guidance according to the holy spirit right okay having said that now let me put that out here is what i wanted to say the true believers are not controlled by man the true believers are not controlled by a council of men or by a church or committee or by the degrees or by their pastor for that matter yes a true church the true church of jesus christ is controlled only by god and by the holy spirit the word comes heavy with you and sends you to god somewhere you're not going to go and they begin building your brother faster faster you know we would say okay please faster can i go please please let me go pastor please bless me and the man of god says yes pastor i am not ready that you should go to that place oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] but i'm teaching you that you must always be spiritual even if i sent you to go preach in some area where the holy spirit never sent you nothing will happen you must go somewhere where the holy spirit has sent you where the world [Music] [Applause] [Music] begin going out to giving up trucks and telling people comparing them to come to christ right you must be raised by the world speaking whatever you do foreign oh they make it very hard for people so when faster god is leading me to go someplace then they will begin casting them let all the casters be on you even you will not see any blessing because your blessing is remaining here i am the one who would be this for you and one who prayed so if you go to another place you are going with all the casters you don't have my blessings oh yeah if god is within you will press for you bye that kind of man is not ready by god when he does that and no person should ever do that therefore if any of you ever feel that if you make this your own church and you ever feel like i want to move on to another place god be with you deal with again because i believe that each of us is not confirmed by god we are controlled by it i had the holy spirit of course you you must have the holy spirit to control you yes some people don't have it and they said they always speak to me where they find you when you can have i know [Music] [Music] they don't you don't find the soldiers but it's what the child believes he said i'm sorry i would not do it that's how i'm left the baptist church and when he left the baptist church he went straight away and followed the leadership of the world spirit went in this place in jeffersonville brought a piece of land and started the tabernacle that church there and from there came a message over the world so don't begin to tell me that one cannot be the main and by the time he was doing all that i'm sure his child was feeling like he is now having all the classes on him this young man is just you know communicated you know he's looking for perspective he wants to you know get rich or something like that or he wants to make a name for himself for him no no matter what people think about you if you know it is god speaking to you if you're not is the word of the holy spirit because when you told me the word never lies everywhere never forget that whenever god moves suddenly moves also but god is always there in your heart to make you listen to his spirit don't say because i'm being i'm being sourced from every eternity i'm out of the world of god no as a matter of fact it's a clear sign of god it's with you hallelujah oh my gosh preaching that secondly three things i think we come to conclude with citizens we're not going now into the message separately his ministry was in the power of the spirit but by demonstrating the spoken hand so he wasn't just coming with uh [Music] oh man forgive me i'm just getting excited with this now what's the third thing sadly the three things to know that god sent you the three things to know at once yes number two will of course not be controlled by men will be controlled by god right number two your ministry will be in the power of that spirit demonstrating not be written and yes [Music] [Music] i came here only with my family but now even in that small church i'm sure when you come with the girls but okay we will not fit there anymore i don't think we shall fit i don't think we can fit it anymore but i was at first with only my family but now how many it's not even a more than a year right and it's been also a year of lockdowns but already sources are believing the message right and even those who have been a rupa and god is lifting them up right what does it show you it shows you what indeed is going to say that yeah that's the evidence of the ministry yes and that should be in each and every one of our lives hallelujah you people this one is very good i i should even have something to talk about more of it in the church amen oh that one got me anointed all right now i think i want to bring you to our close uh allow me because really if we just rush through this thing we are not going to get it very well because all of us now we will discuss on the city of ephesus then now we go to the message of that church let me say that let's go through it quickly but i know that you have heard these things i've integrated with these things so starting with a question on these messages of the message okay let us also deal with a let us also deal with the city of ephesus i think i'll explain this one part and then someone would read that really quickly through it please the city of ephesus is one of the three greatest cities in asia it was often called that city [Music] it was a very city the government was wrong but the language was greek historians believed that mary peter andrew and phillip for all buried in this beautiful city paulo founded the true faith in this city pastored here only about three hours but when he was absent from the flow he was continually prayerfully mindful of them timothy was the first bishop first timothy 1 1-3 for an apostle of christ of jesus christ by the commandment of god our savior and the lord and lord jesus christ which is our hope and ultimately my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord as i either as i be sought to be to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that thou might have charged some that they teach no other doctrine the very name fss has a strange compound meaning aimed at and relaxed the high aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of god whereby they were aiming at the high calling of god began to give away to a less watchful attitude unless i ident a less added following of christ jesus christ began to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of saturn it had become relaxed and was drifting already the edge was back sliding it had left it for its first love the tiny seed planted in that efficient edge would one day grow in the spirit of error until all foul bites in the air would rust in its branches so inoffensive to human reasoning would that little plant appear to that new eve a new church that again should be deceived by saturn the efficient age had presented to her the opportunity for what's best and for well she prevailed and relaxed and in that unguarded and in that unguarded moment saturn planted the seed of complete renation have you had that yes you know it doesn't matter how you start it matters how you end yes you might begin playing fasting reading oh with nursing and then you become a bit lazy that's when something will come and and hit you yes you see so you must really always be on guard at every time because remember the moments when you are on fire the network is not happening so when he says you react you will come quickly he will come quickly at you and that's how you came in at the first church and then we see that that's how he came in and when they got relaxed and he saw that's the discord there continue the very religion of ephesus steps out perfectly his first search engine sets the tenor of the ages to come in the first place the magnificent temple of dana that was so many years in building housed in its safer courts the most beautiful las stellas and unobstructed and unobstrusive image of dinner that one could imagine she was absolutely unlike any other other images sitting seated in the other temples dedicated to her she was simply an almost shirtless female figure that finally sunk into the block of wood from which she was carved and had two arms or formed of two simple bars of iron how perfectly it depicts the spirit of antichrist lost in the first age there he has lost in the midst of the people and yet took no shape as to alarm the people in the two arms of iron ball said that it was his intent to crush the ark of god as he made his inuit and no one seemed to notice him or what he was being but one day they would notice when those arms of iron his deeds became doctrine and his doctrine became the law of an empire the order of temple service is also a very is also very willing there are firsts of all priests who are eunuchs this terrible pursuit you say austerity over people who would give from the life for people who claim to know god apart from the word as barren as life as is asteroids enough secondly the temple had within its confines the virgin priestesses who performed the religious acts of the temple this showed forth the day that ceremony and form rituals and ritual and works will take place of the holy spirit and no longer would charismatic manifestation fill the temple of god over them all was the high priest a man of love power and public influence portraying what was already in progress though not too manifested that is the church would soon be given over to the leadership of man man's plans and ambitions and thus saith the holy ghost would no longer be a living reality and underneath them over the temple slaves who had no choice but obedience religious hierarchy what can this mean but the day would come when the vested clergy by political maneuvering state health and the substitution of the word and spirit for christ dogmas and human leadership would enslave the lady while the leaders laborated in ill-gotten world and enjoyed their filthy pleasures and the poor people who were to be served according to god now became their servants my god this is so happy yeah yes very very hearty and you find these things that were at ephesus and later in the age are also today here in the churches it's the same spirit all through the same spirit all to remember people die but spirits don't die what used to happen then is happening today but in another card in another way yes so we as believers should always be on god especially we should not let the holy spirit die out of our lives we should always respect the holy spirit when i talk about respect in the holy spirit i mean respecting his leadership respecting his control and rule over us and yielding ourselves to him you see those three things respecting his leadership whatever he tells you to do it you know whatever you do if he tells you well go and pray go pray because you go and do something for somebody we are going to begin saying people surprising one another you know you're gonna see someone here without shoes having issues and then you wonder what happened to this brother you know and then you you come back and give your testimony i thank god i have no issues god provided and if you were made by the holy spirit you won't even want that to mention your name but you find people saying hey he buys this insanity for someone [Music] you might be you know having some connection with some people some people you talk to some people you deal with some things you do and the word speaking will speak to you by the way you people sometimes when i say the holy spirit speak to some people so how does he even speak someone i think is about to ask how does he even speak do you hear a big voice or a smaller voice let me tell you how many have ever said something told me raise up your mind okay okay okay how many have never felt something tell them to do something say something is that your hand also okay i'll now tell you the holy spirit is a person it is god it's not a thing it is christ in you the hope of your birth and what does this say he sits on the throne of your heart right there to give commandments to give rules and to give leadership if if i am in libra what will happen to me i'll become stupid you will behave like me you wouldn't like me you will look like me you will talk like me you will walk like me there are many chances you might even dress like me why because our literature is one leading and controlling and guiding you your life is mine in the same way if your spirit is sitting on the throne of your heart you will do everything like him okay and so right but when you have the holy spirit your holy spirit will agree i mean the holy spirit will agree with your spirit and he will begin giving you instructions so it will no longer be something like your spirit it will be the wrong spirit on the throne of your heart confronting you leading you telling your faith yes to another why don't you just get in the news new heart new spirit holy spirit once you have all that you're going to be in complete seat with god you realize you are wearing a mini a mini skirt or a trouser or whatever it is you know the clothing and i was talking about the other day the pastor is not going to go with you when you're going to the shop every time telling her this one leave it this one pass out about this one i just want to know about it around this one but now you see these ones on it first people think sometimes in that kind of perspective we totally aware that god wants you to dress modest both brothers and sisters i am not going to go with you to the show neither other neighbor is going to go with you to the shepherd or the minister it is you laid by the holy spirit amen [Music] yes this is a powerful testimony [Music] you can imagine you know was you know dressing her whatever those things that she has told you but when she received the work and got provided she went and they did shopping no one i wanted did not go without the shop i didn't buy this leave back by this neighbor in him he leads you he guides you he tells you to do things he tells you not to do things right brother man leads you he speaks to you and you must obey whatever he tells you to do if he tells you cut off that friend cut him off but some of you you have the holy spirit speaks to you not even through your past i'm talking to you speaking to you in your heart okay this is what you're preaching from the past i'm telling you about hearing the holy spirit speak to you because [Music] such people said i will accept them and when you receive that holy spirit he will give you instructions he will lead you he will tell you the buddha it's no longer how the lord is because when he sees on the throne of our hearts he takes control he leads he goes he commands he instructs he stops he you know he tells you to move he tells you sit down get out don't rest that dress back do this don't do that bring in that one and he will tell you whatever to do every part of your life will be controlled by him but some people have that kind of spirit you know you know refusing to be made by the holy spirit hallelujah praise the name of the lord amen hallelujah and someone says if i have him tonight pray to get him again look once you have the holy spirit you are saved in the presence of him amen amen if a man tells you loves your sister and you marry them and then all of a sudden when you have him now then he don't want to do what he wants you to do you disobey him you don't cook for him right suffer you don't wash his clothes you don't do anything nice for him and yet he does everything for you with that relationship continue if you would reach a breaking point and he would say you know what have your life if you don't love me go back to your parents because that is a two-way thing it's not a rather thing so what's the holy spirit once you have your husband you have to keep nourishing him once you have your wife you have to keep nourishing up something so once you have the holy spirit you have to keep noticing him you have to continue abiding in that presence where the presence will meet you he will break you he will do whatever he wants to go with you obeying and and so you keep you keep on getting more and you know when you make your husband out what did he do he will bring you a special gift you will never have him but now you may bring a special gift he may bring something nice he may you understand why if you have a worthwhile he so friends we see that in the first church in the depression church you know they were abiding in the holy spirit but it says in this show that the day that's the ceremony and form reach on what will take the place of the holy spirit from charismatic manifestations of god listen lord has never come to that spot whereby anything else we take uh will take place in our life whereby something else will lead us but not the holy spirit let us never get to that place whereby something else is reading us but not the holy spirit because there is nothing as rushed as trying to be something you think you are when you are known hallelujah glory be to god and uh and you always have to keep in that presence of the holy spirit and uh do not grieve him because if you breathe him he will leave and when he leaves the bible says that you cannot be restored again judas was not restored again that's right he he became a son of condition he became a devil he became you know he his name was removed from the beach so don't read the holy spirit you are sealed until when the day of your redemption and keep positive all the time don't don't you look at the negative things that you that might happen look at the positive thing that will happen because as long as you are fighting that presence the positive thing will happen in your life yes well god bless you we'll pick it up from there next time i'd like someone to come and close uh [Music] me [Applause] is we are preparing to also to go for baptisms they're not meeting tomorrow and uh in the morning i i get to find out if everybody is ready but i want to say this and i want to say this before we end up meeting everyone who is not truly convicted in their hearts for it i advise you not to do it because to be able to multiple okay do not try it out god is not they don't try him out they don't monkey you must be ready to forsake the world you must be ready to yield and give your life and you give your life to him you have to repent of your sins what is the repentance the greatness is the decision to recount the world to refuse to connect with the god of animals to do anything in your life to refuse to work in the things that you have been working in before you repent and yield your life to a new thing that god is going to be doing in your life you say this is what repentance is living with the old and stabbing the knee and brother only if you have two people i don't care as long as that person has truly repeated because i know you're going to feel them in the holy spirit that's the most important thing let us see that once again brother joey will come across [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] because you love that jesus
