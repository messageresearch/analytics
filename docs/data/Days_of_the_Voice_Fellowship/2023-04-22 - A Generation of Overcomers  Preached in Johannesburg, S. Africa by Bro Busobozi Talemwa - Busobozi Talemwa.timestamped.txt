[25:41] you're welcome so maybe she'll walk in
[25:44] later if not maybe some other time
[25:48] I visited brother Niven today is doing
[25:52] very well
[25:54] the kidney
[25:56] the kidney was was successful the
[25:59] operation
[26:01] and
[26:03] he was really grateful for life
[26:06] they said in the same word that he was
[26:09] in
[26:10] there was a lady that had gone before
[26:14] him and I think she passed on
[26:17] and he says it was it's an open theater
[26:19] so you actually hear conversations of
[26:23] come and take the cups and things like
[26:25] that and
[26:26] he says your
[26:28] it's not easy
[26:30] and I said you know what God has got a
[26:33] purpose for you
[26:35] that's why he has preserved your life
[26:38] and indeed he's not done with you you
[26:41] are still young your family is Young
[26:43] and we love him so much let's continue
[26:46] uh supporting him with our prayers
[26:49] you must probably be discharged tomorrow
[26:53] so let's continue praying for him I will
[26:58] ask him whether he is prepared for
[27:00] visitors or not because sometimes when

[27:06] overwhelm them with your presence it
[27:08] might disturb the resting process

[39:12] and I noticed in our communication that
[39:15] he's I told him and I told him this I
[39:18] said you're a friend of friends so that
[39:21] means you're my friend because I noticed
[39:24] a few of uh several of my friends that

[39:28] and other countries other continents uh
[39:31] ministers that we relate with and work

[39:58] usually they say it's seven days to
[40:01] apply for a Visa
[40:02] but mine took 15 days

[40:08] maybe we'll just cancel the South
[40:09] African leg and maybe just be in
[40:11] Zimbabwe but you know I I just uh I
[40:15] think we call it striking I say it on
[40:17] the last minute I am going to walk to
[40:19] the visa application center and pick my
[40:21] passport and so I walked there and and
[40:24] they had not called me they had not

[40:30] have we called you they said no we um I
[40:33] said you've not called me but I've come
[40:35] for my passport and so it was the lady
[40:38] was going to dismiss me and at that very
[40:40] moment they are called Center came you
[40:43] know called me and A call came on my
[40:45] phone

[41:07] so but we thank God for his grace and I
[41:10] might be new to you but we are not new
[41:14] to one another we've been in his mind
[41:15] before the foundation of the world
[41:17] and uh I I know that I'm not going to
[41:21] say new things
[41:22] uh whatever we have I think two services
[41:25] or so but in this during this time I I
[41:28] don't expect to hear new things but I'm
[41:31] here to just you know encourage you and
[41:33] you know share uh fellowship with you
[41:36] and see what the Lord is doing in your
[41:38] midst and you hear what the Lord is
[41:39] doing with us and that way we can be
[41:41] encouraged and it will bring us closer
[41:44] to the coming of the Lord
[41:45] amen so receive greetings from the
[41:48] church back home they sent their regards
[41:52] my wife also my wife Rebecca Center
[41:55] regards also to you
[41:58] um and our five uh five children I was
[42:01] telling brother
[42:02] uh the brother that I was with brother
[42:05] Luca and uh I don't know the other
[42:08] brother
[42:09] yes brother blessed I was telling him I
[42:11] said look I have
[42:12] five children and well he said you look
[42:15] young I said yes but I have five
[42:17] children and it's a blessing
[42:18] so he said
[42:21] I'm saying whatever you do
[42:24] it well or don't do it at all and so
[42:29] um if God has given me a wife and a
[42:32] family I should have a family indeed or
[42:35] I shouldn't have a family at all
[42:37] so I'm so grateful and you know God has
[42:41] been a blessing to us
[42:43] and so there's quite a lot that uh I
[42:46] might say but I know usually in the
[42:48] midweek we have a little time and so we
[42:51] want to spare most of the time at least
[42:53] for the sharing of the word and maybe on
[42:55] Sunday we can get to know more of each
[42:57] other and maybe
[42:59] share a little more testimonies of what
[43:01] the Lord has done for us otherwise maybe
[43:03] for a little introduction like the
[43:05] Pastor said I started way earlier in
[43:08] life in the ministry especially I
[43:10] started preaching actually I believed
[43:13] and started preaching this message when
[43:15] I was 15 years by God disgrace
[43:18] and you know God got a hold of me I um
[43:22] my father was a priest in the Anglican
[43:24] church and I thought I was also going to
[43:26] be one because the bishop of our church
[43:28] got a hold of me when I was
[43:30] almost 13 years and it took me in to
[43:34] live with him in his Palace and so I
[43:36] started training me and I started
[43:37] watching him Minister and wearing his
[43:39] big robes and I admired them because you
[43:42] see these people look as if they're very
[43:44] close to God and you also want to be
[43:46] close to God and you feel you want to do
[43:48] something that will bring you close to
[43:49] God so I started admiring you know
[43:51] wearing those robes and having that big
[43:54] ring with a Crosser need to how he gave
[43:56] people you know the blessing and
[43:59] you know you would be in a room and then
[44:01] you pray and then afterwards he's the
[44:03] last one to uh to give them a blessing
[44:06] so then he would say the blessing of the
[44:08] you know the I need to give you the
[44:10] blessing in the name of the father and
[44:12] of the son and of the Holy Spirit and oh
[44:15] everybody would feel like God has spoken
[44:17] and so I kind of felt that at that time
[44:20] that oh I really want to be this close
[44:23] to God and I want to serve God like this
[44:25] so it was my dream to be a bishop and
[44:29] and uh so one time the bishop asked me
[44:32] can you preach and we're on the dining
[44:34] table you know he had kind of adopted me
[44:36] and so I was 13 years and he said can
[44:39] you preach so I said uh I don't know
[44:42] what to say but of course if he has
[44:44] asked I did not want to turn it down
[44:46] because I I knew in my heart I always
[44:47] wanted to be like him so I say it by
[44:49] God's grace I think I can so it was then
[44:52] that he told me now tomorrow I'm going
[44:55] to uh to go to one of the
[44:57] archdictionaries and I would like you to
[44:58] preach
[45:00] and of course in the Anglican Church to
[45:02] preach you have to put on account so
[45:04] that whole night I didn't sleep I was
[45:07] awake because I was nervous I had never
[45:10] stood before people and whenever the
[45:12] bishop would visit you are expecting at
[45:15] least a minimum of 500 people and I was
[45:17] young and I had never spoken to this uh
[45:20] you know kind of congregation so I
[45:24] didn't sleep the whole night and in the
[45:27] morning you know I was nervous the whole
[45:29] time as we traveled but when I we
[45:31] arrived there of course in the night the
[45:33] lord gave me an inspiration to speak on
[45:34] Galatians chapter 3 and so when we
[45:37] reached there I long story short I I
[45:39] just preached on that and a few people
[45:41] believed on Jesus Christ because I was
[45:44] preaching Jesus Christ
[45:45] as their Savior and so they accepted
[45:48] Christ as their Savior and so about 100
[45:50] people came and the bishop came and
[45:53] blessed them and he said now you are
[45:54] saved you can go back to your seats
[45:56] and so
[45:58] um from that day I felt that maybe God
[46:01] was you know calling me to the ministry
[46:03] and the bishop loved it so he started
[46:05] each time whenever he would travel to
[46:06] ask me to you know tag along and you
[46:09] know speak in the places where he was
[46:10] going so the whole two years of my life
[46:13] I was with a bishop you know you know
[46:16] traveling with him and preaching and he
[46:18] named me the decision young evangelist
[46:22] and and so the Archbishop one time came
[46:24] and he introduced me said uh the this is
[46:28] our decision young evangelist and in my
[46:30] heart I felt like yeah now it means I'm
[46:33] on the path of becoming a bishop and so
[46:36] because I felt that you know to be a
[46:37] bishop was to be very close to God and I
[46:41] just wanted to be close to God and to
[46:43] serve God and to serve his people that
[46:44] was the desire of my heart it was my
[46:46] ambition you know I don't know how many
[46:48] young people here have Ambitions that
[46:50] was my ambition and so uh that was my
[46:54] plan but God had other plans anyways and
[46:56] so
[46:57] um
[46:59] so that would continue on until I I
[47:02] became 15 and it was at that time when I
[47:05] was 15. that the Lord brought me among
[47:09] Believers of this message and I started
[47:11] hearing the message of the hour
[47:14] I saw this picture for my first time
[47:17] and incidentally my mother
[47:20] brought me in this family friend's house
[47:22] where I was supposed to stay and live
[47:24] with them for for about four years of my
[47:27] school but she told me these people
[47:31] the family friend was a pastor in this
[47:33] message
[47:34] and so and I was supposed to live with
[47:36] him but my mother told me
[47:39] you see that picture I said yes
[47:41] that's the Monday worship so be very
[47:44] careful
[47:45] don't don't hear what they have to say
[47:48] because they are in account so be very
[47:50] careful don't believe what they have to
[47:53] say and they said okay so I always
[47:55] looked at that picture
[47:56] and I wondered I waited for them to bow
[47:59] to that picture but that day didn't come
[48:01] until I asked because they had shared
[48:03] the godhead that shared water baptism
[48:05] they are talked about uh you know Rome
[48:08] and its influence and its false
[48:10] doctrines they are talked about most of
[48:11] the things in the scriptures but they
[48:12] had not talked about that picture
[48:14] so then I waited for them to bow to the
[48:17] picture they did not so I was confused I
[48:19] said my mom told me they worship this
[48:21] man and so one day I asked this uh
[48:25] brother he said who is that man he said
[48:28] oh that's a very good question so then
[48:30] we sat down and
[48:32] for he preached to me for three hours
[48:34] and during that time he of course showed
[48:37] me the script the pro the prophecy how
[48:39] God promised uh that there would come
[48:41] and Elijah and this Elijah would come
[48:43] and turn the hearts of the fathers to
[48:44] the children and the hearts of the
[48:45] children to the fathers and and how is
[48:48] not the man that they are going to
[48:50] worship but he's going to introduce to
[48:52] them Jesus Christ
[48:54] through the his ministry would introduce
[48:57] to them the word which is Jesus Christ
[48:58] and so as we went through that
[49:02] it made sense but nothing in me really
[49:05] wanted to leave the glory which I had
[49:08] been promised the other side
[49:10] and so the bishop had even told me by
[49:12] the way that he would take me to the U.S
[49:14] and you know I would study Theology and
[49:16] then of course I would rise up in the
[49:19] ranks so I didn't want to give up that
[49:21] and this made sense but not it I
[49:24] accepted it in my in my head but in my
[49:26] heart I had I was still holding on to
[49:29] what I I was believing the other side
[49:31] and so here was my turning point and I
[49:35] want to get to this and then we'll get
[49:37] to the one
[49:40] because I was living with a bishop
[49:42] rather with a pastor now and I didn't
[49:45] give you the whole story because of time
[49:46] but I was now living with the pastor of
[49:48] the message in his home
[49:50] I had to go to our church our Anglican
[49:54] Church very early in the morning
[49:56] and then in the up in the mid morning
[49:58] there because of course you know
[49:59] anglicans we just pray for one two hours
[50:02] and then in the mid morning then I would
[50:05] come to the message Church of course I
[50:06] had nowhere to go I had no home to
[50:08] return to
[50:09] they were still at church so I would go
[50:10] and join them and so
[50:13] um I I left
[50:15] that day to go to our church and I
[50:18] reached our church it was the English
[50:20] morning service
[50:22] I don't know how many here were
[50:24] anglicans
[50:27] okay at least I have my fellow Anglican
[50:30] there and so it was the early morning
[50:33] English service and so there were many
[50:36] things that were that of course are done
[50:38] in the church and that day uh the bishop
[50:42] uh rather the oh the bishop stuck in my
[50:45] head so the the the priest came up and
[50:47] she was a woman that day and so she
[50:49] preached a very good someone and but
[50:52] then as she was preaching my heart was
[50:54] telling me because of course remembering
[50:56] what these people were sharing with me
[50:57] the whole time for about six months so
[51:00] you know it's wrong for a woman to a sub
[51:03] authority over a man or to teach and and
[51:05] this woman is teaching and then the
[51:07] other mind was telling me anyway it's
[51:08] once in a while after all most of the
[51:10] time it's a man who preaches so well my
[51:13] mind was telling me to forget it but my
[51:15] heart was telling me it is wrong and
[51:17] then in the same service they taught us
[51:19] to turn towards I think the East and
[51:22] then to recite the Apostles Creed and
[51:24] then within the Apostles Creed there is
[51:25] this phrase and I believe in the Holy
[51:28] Catholic church and this brother I
[51:31] remember the words of the brother when
[51:32] he told me you are Catholic I told him
[51:35] no I am Protestant that's why I am
[51:38] protesting Catholicism so I cannot be
[51:41] Catholic so when everybody was reciting
[51:44] that and he said and I believe in the
[51:45] Holy Catholic Church I said to myself so
[51:48] I was deceived all these years and I
[51:50] didn't know and so
[51:52] um so I was my I was losing my mind I
[51:55] was beginning to lose my mind at that
[51:57] moment because the reality was now
[51:59] beginning to strike me to strike my
[52:01] heart and then they taught us to to turn
[52:04] to look in the red to the to the ray of
[52:06] the church and when we did it was a
[52:08] baptism service so the priest called
[52:11] who is the Godfather and of course you
[52:14] know if you you've been there like my
[52:15] sister you know the pros the pros the
[52:17] process of the procedure so then they
[52:19] gave the name uh to a child to the baby
[52:22] and then the man was the one answering
[52:24] on behalf of the baby and the whole time
[52:27] my mind my heart was telling me this is
[52:29] wrong this is wrong where is it in the
[52:31] Bible where is it in the scripture
[52:33] and so uh at that moment I began to hear
[52:38] a wall something like whirling around my
[52:41] my head I thought it was uh in my head
[52:44] inside my head but I was hearing it also
[52:47] in my ears
[52:49] so I began to look around and wonder
[52:52] what what it was and it was at that very
[52:55] moment as this man was baptizing this
[52:57] baby I baptized in the name of the
[52:58] father taking the holy water so-called
[53:00] and then the voice came out of that and
[53:03] said called me by name you see friends
[53:06] whenever I say this sometimes I wonder
[53:08] whether the people believe it that here
[53:09] but the truth is this is exactly what
[53:12] happened
[53:13] and the voice called me by name and said
[53:15] talimua find the nearest exit and leave
[53:19] this place because you were in the wrong
[53:21] place and when I heard that I didn't
[53:24] believe it myself
[53:26] and then and then at that moment you
[53:30] know the the voice came the second time
[53:31] and I was just lingering and the voice
[53:33] when the voice came the third time I
[53:35] didn't do it I picked my Bible it had a
[53:37] red cover just like this and then I
[53:39] swung my way out of the church and that
[53:42] was would be my last time as a member in
[53:45] the Anglican Church
[53:48] but make no mistake I had not made up my
[53:50] mind to join the message yet so because
[53:53] I this voice pulled me out of that but
[53:56] it did not pull me out of the other I
[53:58] mean into the other so I had now I was
[54:00] pulled out but I still had nowhere to go
[54:02] I had many questions I was too confused
[54:04] to go anywhere or to join any uh in a
[54:07] church because now here I had dumped my
[54:10] lifelong ambition
[54:13] and so of course as usual I found myself
[54:15] in a believer's church because that's
[54:17] where the people that I was living with
[54:19] were going I had nowhere else to go
[54:22] Brethren I found
[54:25] the other time I think a few days ago I
[54:28] Saw You Preach and that's how that
[54:31] brother was preaching
[54:33] he was preaching as if he had fire
[54:37] under his toys
[54:39] and and he was pounding the word
[54:42] pounding the word and do you know what
[54:44] he was preaching about the things I left
[54:46] in my church one by one he was hitting
[54:49] them one by one by one by one
[54:51] I couldn't help it but my heart because
[54:54] my heart you know you know begun to
[54:57] respond to what I was hearing and it was
[54:59] at that very moment that uh when he
[55:02] finished preaching he called us who had
[55:04] given their lives to Jesus Christ I was
[55:06] still you know hesitating to go and and
[55:09] that atmosphere came back again around
[55:12] where I was and I you know I began
[55:15] uncontrolling it I was not able to
[55:17] control myself I began to shake my body
[55:19] was like shaking
[55:21] you know friends the presence of God is
[55:23] real
[55:23] the power of God is real the holy spirit
[55:27] is real and if only we can believe it if
[55:30] you have never experienced it just
[55:31] believe it one day you're going to
[55:33] experience it
[55:34] and so as I was shaking uncontrollably
[55:38] at that moment that voice came back
[55:40] again and and called me again by the
[55:43] same surname said talimoire stand up on
[55:46] your feet raise both your hands up and
[55:48] declare on top of your voice that you
[55:50] have believed this message to be the
[55:52] truth and you would like to be baptized
[55:55] and then I first a battle that I had
[55:59] never faced before that voice would
[56:01] speak and another voice would speak that
[56:02] voice would speak it came second when it
[56:05] was coming the third time I felt like I
[56:08] had no control over this and I wanted to
[56:10] let this go so I stood up and you know
[56:14] tears began flowing through my eyes and
[56:16] I lifted up one of my hands it said two
[56:19] but because maybe because of fear I I
[56:21] you know lifted up only one and I tried
[56:24] to shout but I couldn't shout and I just
[56:26] said I've believed this message and I
[56:29] would like to be baptized in the name of
[56:31] our Lord Jesus Christ and you know
[56:34] everybody started clapping their hands
[56:36] and you know there was like commotion
[56:38] that there were about 15 people but you
[56:40] would say you would maybe think they
[56:42] were like 200 because of exact the
[56:44] excitement that was there
[56:46] and they were not rich people they were
[56:49] very poor people and of course this is
[56:50] one of the reasons why I didn't want to
[56:53] believe the message because where I was
[56:55] they were well to do living in Palisades
[56:58] big churches here they are poor they are
[57:00] living in Ashanti place which they are
[57:03] calling a church place and I was really
[57:05] looking down on them but here the Holy
[57:08] Spirit arrested me I didn't remember any
[57:10] of that and so they collected a little
[57:12] money and and put fewer in one of the
[57:15] cars that was there at the time and they
[57:17] took me and baptized me and at 15 I got
[57:20] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[57:22] Christ
[57:24] and Friends
[57:26] from that moment when I came out of the
[57:28] Waters of baptism I made up my mind
[57:31] and I pledged my life to serve the Lord
[57:34] and tell people about this end time
[57:36] message
[57:37] because guess what I believe this
[57:40] message now to be the truth
[57:42] and if there is one thing I've come to
[57:44] do here is maybe to give a testimony to
[57:48] inspire one or two
[57:50] and encourage them and tell them that
[57:52] this message is the truth
[57:54] praise the name of the Lord
[57:57] it's been how many years since brother
[57:59] Barnum left the sin 50 80 years I was
[58:02] just looking at it today he preached the
[58:04] last sermon 58 years ago and there's
[58:08] been brother Barnum told us that a
[58:10] generation is 40 so it's been one
[58:13] generation past and another one is also
[58:15] going and another one will come we do
[58:17] not know when the Lord will come but we
[58:18] know soon and very soon he will come but
[58:21] if the Lord comes we want to find
[58:23] ourselves ready
[58:24] but I believe that we are living in a
[58:26] Time friends if you look around yourself
[58:29] and you see the age and the age that you
[58:33] have and the age that somebody else has
[58:35] and the Ministries that God is raising
[58:37] up in our time surely No Doubt
[58:41] we are in another generation
[58:43] and we are in a generation of people
[58:45] that must
[58:46] not only believe the message but be
[58:49] enthused about the message be zealous
[58:52] about this message
[58:53] and be able not only to preach it but to
[58:56] take it out not to preach it in the
[58:58] church only but to take it out to the
[58:59] streets to the byways
[59:02] if this message is worth
[59:05] living for then it is worth dying for
[59:07] and we should do all that we can to take
[59:10] this message out and so friends without
[59:13] wasting more time I'd like you to stand
[59:15] we'll check one um just one line out of
[59:18] James chapter 4 verse 7.
[59:21] and um I woke up at 3 A.M yesterday was
[59:26] it today yeah you see I've even lost
[59:28] track of time on on time so I'm not a
[59:32] hundred percent sober because I didn't
[59:34] have enough time to rest but when the
[59:36] Holy Spirit takes all takes over I
[59:39] believe that he will be able to I think
[59:41] it's better that way when I'm not sober
[59:42] so that he can be able to take over and
[59:45] speak whatever he wants to speak to the
[59:46] people
[59:47] Pastor I'd like to know how much time do
[59:49] we have
[59:51] praise the name of the Lord well I'll
[59:54] preach as long as you can you can bear
[59:55] me with me
[59:57] James chapter 4.
[1:00:03] verses 7.
[1:00:08] submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:00:10] resist the devil and he will free flee
[1:00:14] from you

[1:00:27] of the word let us pray Lord Jesus we
[1:00:31] want to commit this session into your
[1:00:33] hands the little moments we're going to

[1:00:42] and take over guide my lips guide my
[1:00:44] mind guide My Heart Lord Jesus and even
[1:00:46] the people father that oh God you will
[1:00:48] inspire all of us together into the
[1:00:50] channel that you have desired and
[1:00:52] designed for all of us today that we
[1:00:54] will hear from Heaven Lord in the
[1:00:56] precious name of Jesus Christ amen you
[1:00:59] may have your seats
[1:01:01] so this morning I'd like to speak or or
[1:01:03] not only this evening but uh the the for
[1:01:08] the for the whole time I'll be here the
[1:01:09] Lord willing what I have on my my mind
[1:01:12] is what I just introduced to you a
[1:01:14] generation
[1:01:15] the general a generation of Overcomers
[1:01:18] but this evening I have a little thought
[1:01:20] and this came to me while I was asking
[1:01:23] the Lord what I will speak on and you
[1:01:25] know the word just came to me no
[1:01:27] negotiations and so I wanted to look
[1:01:30] through the scripture and find out about
[1:01:31] this negotiation I don't know if we have
[1:01:34] a salesman here or sales people here you
[1:01:37] know they're very good at negotiating if
[1:01:39] you uh you go especially here in Africa
[1:01:41] I don't know in South Africa it is South
[1:01:43] Africa but I'm from Uganda where it is
[1:01:45] Africa I had Pastor call it Africa so
[1:01:48] here it is South Africa and in Africa we
[1:01:50] like negotiating When someone tells you
[1:01:53] that something is 5000 you don't easily
[1:01:55] bite at 5000 you ask them can you reduce
[1:01:58] for me can you make it can you make it
[1:02:00] can you can the price go down a little
[1:02:02] bit so you know we negotiate and some
[1:02:04] people are very good negotiators and you
[1:02:07] know and so but you see there's
[1:02:10] something that I believe as a generation
[1:02:13] the time that we have arrived at that we
[1:02:16] must not negotiate with vote
[1:02:19] you see there are many things that the
[1:02:22] devil has desired to Rob away from us
[1:02:25] you see this message that we have
[1:02:27] believed the end time message is a
[1:02:30] message of restoration
[1:02:32] God has sent a prophet with a message of
[1:02:35] restoration it is not to bring or to
[1:02:39] form another denomination or another
[1:02:41] church this message came to bring death
[1:02:44] to to make to bring uh I should say to
[1:02:47] bring life out of death now you remember
[1:02:49] that story of Ezekiel you know the voice
[1:02:52] told him Ezekiel can this uh at bonds
[1:02:55] Dry Bones live again you know you see
[1:02:58] this message is the life that can make
[1:03:01] and put life again in the dry bones
[1:03:04] praise the name of the Lord and so we
[1:03:07] are in a wrestling match with the Devil
[1:03:09] and you know as we all know the battle
[1:03:11] did not start here the battle started
[1:03:13] way up in heaven so actually we are
[1:03:16] fighting the Battle of angels the battle
[1:03:19] started in heaven but we are right now
[1:03:21] we found ourselves in the middle of this
[1:03:24] battle actually one brother one time uh
[1:03:26] one of the uh children of mine in the
[1:03:29] Lord in Ethiopia he was preaching and he
[1:03:31] said this and it really stuck with me he
[1:03:33] said
[1:03:34] why did God not finish the devil why did
[1:03:37] he throw him down to the Earth because
[1:03:40] he wanted you know God is God and how
[1:03:43] could God destroy the Devil he would how
[1:03:45] could he stoop someone to destroy the
[1:03:47] Devil he had to throw him down here so
[1:03:49] that his sons can finish him so we are
[1:03:52] here to finish this battle we are here
[1:03:55] not to negotiate with the devil we are
[1:03:58] here to finish whatever we are fighting
[1:04:00] this is a battle of angels and it be you
[1:04:03] know it became the Battle of men and
[1:04:06] most like the Fallen Angels you know
[1:04:07] will be outmatched by the devil and it
[1:04:10] is so sad to see even sometimes people
[1:04:12] claiming to believe this message after
[1:04:14] 30 years
[1:04:16] they come up and say well I uh why the
[1:04:18] reason why I left
[1:04:20] and it is so sad that even Believers
[1:04:23] would waste their time to listen to such
[1:04:25] stuff as that
[1:04:27] you know the devil wants us to come to a
[1:04:31] place of compromise the devil wants us
[1:04:33] to lose vision on what we have received
[1:04:36] the devil is working every day to try
[1:04:39] and hinder us the devil is working every
[1:04:42] way to try and take us away from the
[1:04:46] prize that God has intended for us in
[1:04:48] this in this our time our day our
[1:04:50] generation but I want to tell you there
[1:04:53] are many people falling for the trick of
[1:04:55] the devil there are many people who are
[1:04:57] outmatched by the devil but there is a
[1:04:59] race there is a people there is a
[1:05:01] generation that is going to overcome did
[1:05:04] you know that in every generation there
[1:05:07] was a people there was a race there were
[1:05:09] those that were called that were known
[1:05:11] by God before the foundation of the
[1:05:13] world and they were predestinated to
[1:05:16] overcome
[1:05:18] I believe I'm one of them
[1:05:20] Hallelujah when I believe the message I
[1:05:23] had them sing that song one of them oh I
[1:05:25] love that song one of them one of them
[1:05:28] I'm so glad that I can say I am one of
[1:05:30] them
[1:05:31] I did not believe this message only to
[1:05:34] be defeated by the devil
[1:05:36] I believed this message to overcome the
[1:05:39] world I believe this message to live as
[1:05:42] an overcomer and I believe friends there
[1:05:45] is nothing can overcome a Believer who
[1:05:48] will stand on the grounds of the world
[1:05:51] how many believe that
[1:05:53] Victory Is Ours over the world and Over
[1:05:56] The Temptations they are of their many
[1:05:58] Temptations in the world there are three
[1:06:01] things that the Bible speaks of the
[1:06:03] pride of life the lust of the eyes and
[1:06:06] the lust of the Flesh and these are the
[1:06:08] things that have you know come to attack
[1:06:10] every living mortal every one of you has
[1:06:14] been attacked by those three things
[1:06:16] every living human being will be
[1:06:18] attacked by those three things even
[1:06:20] Jesus himself was attacked by those
[1:06:22] three things
[1:06:24] but did you know that Jesus overcame
[1:06:27] why did you overcome because Jesus was
[1:06:30] born for a purpose and the purpose of
[1:06:34] Jesus's birth was to overcome the devil
[1:06:37] once and for all
[1:06:40] and I want to say that as Believers of
[1:06:43] this message when you receive this
[1:06:45] message hallelujah praise the name of
[1:06:47] the Lord
[1:06:48] this message
[1:06:50] is putting us in a place whereby we can
[1:06:54] be able to overcome the devil
[1:06:56] all the people out there cannot be able
[1:06:58] to overcome the overcoming power is
[1:07:00] within the message of the hour
[1:07:04] and I would like to say let us march on
[1:07:07] let us fight for every inch of ground
[1:07:10] that the Lord has promised us
[1:07:13] we should never come to a place of
[1:07:15] negotiation negotiating with Saturn we
[1:07:18] are to fight because Victory is assured
[1:07:21] I'd like you to look at First Peter
[1:07:23] Chapter 5 Verse 6 it says humble
[1:07:25] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[1:07:26] hand of God that he may exalt you in due
[1:07:29] time casting all your cares upon Him for
[1:07:33] he cares for you be sober be vigilant
[1:07:36] because your anniversary the devil has a
[1:07:39] rolling lion walketh about seeking whom
[1:07:42] he made divine
[1:07:45] whom resists steadfast in in the faith
[1:07:49] in their faith knowing that the same
[1:07:53] afflictions are accomplished in your
[1:07:56] brethren that are in the world
[1:08:02] unless you praise the name of the Lord
[1:08:04] now I'd like you to look at this he says
[1:08:07] that because your adversary the devil
[1:08:09] has a rolling lion worketh about seeking
[1:08:12] whom he may divide it you know that
[1:08:14] every day that you rise up early in the
[1:08:17] morning the devil has a trap set for you
[1:08:19] did you know that the devil never sleeps
[1:08:22] he never actually he never Slumbers he
[1:08:24] is always awake to try to see how he
[1:08:26] will trap you to try to see how he will
[1:08:29] divert you you try to see how he'll
[1:08:31] bring you down but the Bible says listen
[1:08:34] he says what should we do as Believers
[1:08:36] he says we should resist him
[1:08:39] study firstly in the faith he did not
[1:08:43] say by faith he said in the faith so
[1:08:46] what faith in the faith which was once
[1:08:48] delivered unto the Saints
[1:08:51] in the master of the hour amen knowing
[1:08:54] that the same afflictions are
[1:08:56] accomplishing your brethren that are in
[1:08:57] the world Amen there is nothing that you
[1:09:00] are going through that no that another
[1:09:02] brother is you know has never gone
[1:09:04] through whatever you are going through
[1:09:06] somebody else has gone through it
[1:09:09] and that's not all whatever we are going
[1:09:11] through Jesus Christ went through it
[1:09:14] what did you know that whatever battle
[1:09:16] you're fighting Jesus Christ fought it
[1:09:19] to the extent that brother said he was
[1:09:21] tempted with all manner of temptations
[1:09:23] that we attempted with even sexual
[1:09:26] Temptations
[1:09:27] there is no temptation that you go
[1:09:29] through amen that Jesus did not go
[1:09:32] through but Jesus went through it and
[1:09:34] overcame it
[1:09:35] Hallelujah in order for what in order
[1:09:38] for us also to overcome
[1:09:41] Jesus was first with the devil but Jesus
[1:09:44] if there is one thing that Jesus never
[1:09:46] did Jesus never negotiated with Satan
[1:09:49] whenever he met Satan he stood on his
[1:09:53] ground he never negotiated he never
[1:09:56] negotiated but the problem that we have
[1:09:59] in our generation many young people many
[1:10:01] people and negotiating with the devil
[1:10:04] when you know your god-given rights when
[1:10:07] you know your god-given promises but you
[1:10:09] wash and see the devil take it away from
[1:10:12] you and you do nothing about it
[1:10:16] why does the devil done Even in our
[1:10:18] message fraternity the devil has
[1:10:20] replaced the fire of God the Devils
[1:10:23] replace Let the Fire of God the baptism
[1:10:26] of the Holy Ghost with just church and
[1:10:28] doctrines
[1:10:30] I'm sorry if I say what you don't want
[1:10:32] to hear
[1:10:33] Hallelujah the devil has replaced it you
[1:10:36] know with just formality the devil has
[1:10:38] made a Baptist religion but let me tell
[1:10:41] you we are not about this religion
[1:10:44] we are believers of the end time message
[1:10:47] hallelujah holy ghosts filled thanks
[1:10:51] speaking
[1:10:52] fire pact children of God Amen who are
[1:10:56] being prepared to go in the rapture
[1:10:59] I will tell you why I left the Anglican
[1:11:02] Church I left the Anglican church
[1:11:04] because I want to go in the rapture
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:08] and I am determining I am determined no
[1:11:12] matter what comes my way I must go in
[1:11:14] the rapture
[1:11:15] [Applause]
[1:11:18] Hallelujah
[1:11:20] we are not going to negotiate with the
[1:11:22] Devil
[1:11:23] Hallelujah if you want to replace him
[1:11:26] and the fire of God with the religion
[1:11:28] what are we going to do we are not going
[1:11:30] to negotiate with the Devil
[1:11:33] Hallelujah
[1:11:35] praise the name of the Lord
[1:11:38] do you love the message
[1:11:44] When you pray for people you apologize
[1:11:46] say Mr devil
[1:11:49] would you please
[1:11:51] move over and let me
[1:11:56] did you know there are some people in
[1:11:58] the message
[1:12:00] who are no longer praying for the sick
[1:12:04] and they are preaching it as a Doctrine
[1:12:06] now I believe when you are here when
[1:12:08] you're in your seats and you're hearing
[1:12:09] the word I believe the word can heal you
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:13] but I also believe in praying for the
[1:12:15] sick and laying on of hands amen
[1:12:19] but you see
[1:12:21] you know they would say
[1:12:22] you know Mr Deva would you please move
[1:12:25] over here and let me you know and by the
[1:12:27] manam says nothing faith has got masses
[1:12:30] and here on its chest when it speaks
[1:12:34] everything else shuts up don't go in Mr
[1:12:37] devil you move out
[1:12:41] Hallelujah
[1:12:43] get out here I'm a Son of God I'm
[1:12:47] commissioned of God leave them alone and
[1:12:50] he says that moves you have no apology
[1:12:52] to the devil nothing to do with him not
[1:12:55] ashamed of the word of God not ashamed
[1:12:57] of your commission not ashamed of who we
[1:12:59] are we know who we are and we are not
[1:13:01] going to be ashamed of it we are not
[1:13:03] going to be apologetic we know what we
[1:13:06] believe we are not going to happen to
[1:13:08] apologize for what we believe
[1:13:10] Hallelujah we are not ashamed of this
[1:13:13] message we are not ashamed to tell the
[1:13:15] people God has sent a prophet in our
[1:13:18] generation we are not ashamed to say we
[1:13:20] believe Amen in the bathroom of the Holy
[1:13:22] Ghost we are not ashamed
[1:13:25] Hallelujah let me tell you if you are
[1:13:29] ashamed of it it means you don't believe
[1:13:31] it but if you believe it you cannot be
[1:13:33] ashamed of it
[1:13:36] oh Hallelujah
[1:13:38] the key is in knowing who you are if we
[1:13:42] know who we are we will not be ashamed
[1:13:44] of the word if we are amen not ashamed
[1:13:47] of the word we will not negotiate
[1:13:52] if we are not ashamed of the word amen
[1:13:55] we will not negotiate
[1:13:58] let me tell you something here I was
[1:14:01] just reading an article here and
[1:14:04] and this whoever wrote it I just read it
[1:14:08] for you
[1:14:09] so that you can get
[1:14:11] the understanding of what negotiation is
[1:14:15] and it says for new kids
[1:14:18] politicians in the U.S and the UK have
[1:14:20] gradually stated that we do not
[1:14:22] negotiate with terrorists
[1:14:24] arguing that it is both morally
[1:14:26] indefensible and impractical likely to
[1:14:29] encourage mortalism and Lead
[1:14:31] ministerialist aims and in March 1973
[1:14:34] members of a Palestinian militant
[1:14:37] organization took a group of hostages in
[1:14:40] the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum among them
[1:14:43] three westerners now asked at a press
[1:14:46] conference how his government would
[1:14:49] respond U.S president Richard Nixon
[1:14:51] replied
[1:14:53] I love this response so seemingly off
[1:14:56] the card that there could be no
[1:14:58] negotiation with terrorists
[1:15:01] his people
[1:15:03] we are caught we are Behind Enemy Lines
[1:15:07] and he understood that this might mean
[1:15:10] actually signing a death warrant for
[1:15:13] them
[1:15:14] but he knew if he negotiated with the
[1:15:17] terrorists it was going to start up or
[1:15:19] to put a precedent which was going to be
[1:15:22] very hard for him and for his government
[1:15:25] so he knew he had a decision to take
[1:15:28] imagine the devil maybe might have taken
[1:15:30] some of your things hostage he might
[1:15:33] have taken some of your loved ones
[1:15:34] hostage he might have done something bad
[1:15:37] in your family something bad in your
[1:15:39] life something bad amen you know he
[1:15:41] might have taken your Victory away from
[1:15:43] you amen but the many Believers what do
[1:15:45] they do they want to negotiate with the
[1:15:47] devil but let me tell you here is aiming
[1:15:50] a politician amen Richard Nixon the
[1:15:53] President of the U.S at the time he said
[1:15:54] let me let me tell you there will be no
[1:15:57] negotiation with terrorists
[1:16:01] do you know what happened
[1:16:04] the following the Western hostages were
[1:16:06] killed
[1:16:07] since then the policy has become all but
[1:16:10] impossible to roll back from becoming
[1:16:13] integral to us and to UK foreign policy
[1:16:17] Doctrine I thought when I was reading
[1:16:20] this I thought they were going to change
[1:16:21] their mind they never changed their mind
[1:16:23] even when their people died
[1:16:26] I
[1:16:28] who do I remember he
[1:16:35] man when they stood amen before the
[1:16:37] tourists of that time they said listen
[1:16:39] we shall not bow we shall not Bend we
[1:16:43] shall not negotiate we know who we
[1:16:45] believe we know and we are persuaded he
[1:16:48] is able to keep every promise in man
[1:16:51] [Applause]
[1:16:52] Hallelujah
[1:16:54] and he said I will throw you through the
[1:16:56] I will throw you in the fire he said
[1:16:57] well you can try but even in the fire
[1:17:00] amen we will not negotiate
[1:17:04] and right there when they threw them in
[1:17:06] the fire oh my God praise the name of
[1:17:08] the Lord when they threw them in the
[1:17:10] fire he was right there in the fire
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:15] Hallelujah
[1:17:16] let me tell you the devil is a terrorist
[1:17:19] his intention is from the very beginning
[1:17:20] have been to steal to kill and to
[1:17:24] destroy God has given us his unfailing
[1:17:27] promises in the message of the hour how
[1:17:29] many believe that
[1:17:31] the message of Yahweh is God is
[1:17:33] unfailing promises to us amen and you
[1:17:35] know to negotiate with the Devil
[1:17:39] oh you know to uh to negotiate with the
[1:17:42] Devil is actually for Faith what belongs
[1:17:44] to you
[1:17:45] what belongs to us and his message the
[1:17:49] message of the hour the promises it is
[1:17:51] given to us is is given I would like to
[1:17:54] say that the message of the hour is our
[1:17:56] Birthright how many believe that
[1:17:59] the message of the hour is our Promised
[1:18:01] Land
[1:18:02] the message of the hour is Our Hope
[1:18:04] the message of the hour is where our
[1:18:07] anchor holds
[1:18:11] I'm in another song The Anchor Holds
[1:18:14] even when the ship is battered but The
[1:18:16] Anchor Holds
[1:18:18] amen and therefore let me tell you we
[1:18:21] should not negotiate with the devil in
[1:18:22] any way because if we do we are
[1:18:24] forfeiting what belongs to us
[1:18:27] to negotiate with him is legitimize he's
[1:18:30] terrorist aims to negotiate with him is
[1:18:34] actually morally indefensible and
[1:18:36] impractical just like the amen President
[1:18:39] Nixon said
[1:18:41] Hallelujah
[1:18:42] what is yours
[1:18:44] is yours
[1:18:46] and you claim it
[1:18:49] Hallelujah
[1:18:51] oh my my whatever whatever you are
[1:18:54] hearing I'm just introducing myself to
[1:18:56] you and I'm not going to get into big
[1:18:58] meat I'm just go you know going into a
[1:19:00] little thing so I just wanted to catch
[1:19:02] it receive it don't wait for me to
[1:19:03] preach I'm already preaching
[1:19:06] whatever is yours is yours claim it
[1:19:11] Hallelujah
[1:19:13] praise the name of the Lord
[1:19:15] can you imagine
[1:19:17] I don't know whether you have that here
[1:19:19] but back in our country there would be
[1:19:21] people
[1:19:23] who actually are satisfied
[1:19:25] with
[1:19:27] head knowledge
[1:19:31] at the expense of the power the
[1:19:35] manifestation of life
[1:19:37] the message of the hour is not just the
[1:19:40] knowledge
[1:19:42] that is the beginning
[1:19:44] you see the message of the hour is the
[1:19:48] life
[1:19:49] that is why you've seen people who
[1:19:51] actually can come in church like this
[1:19:53] and I believe in listening to tapes I I
[1:19:55] listen to them I've given a lot of
[1:19:57] people a means to be able to listen to
[1:19:59] the message of the hour I mean to listen
[1:20:00] to the verse about the bottom I believe
[1:20:01] in that 100 and you see when when you
[1:20:04] talk about what I'm going to say many
[1:20:06] people say oh you're fighting brother no
[1:20:08] nobody no we're not fighting brother
[1:20:09] actually we are saying what he's saying
[1:20:11] because we are in the spirit of what he
[1:20:14] was in Hallelujah when badam said he was
[1:20:18] saying what Paul said he did not read
[1:20:20] the letter to the Corinthians and then
[1:20:23] you know chapter one chapter two chapter
[1:20:25] three what by what no he was preaching
[1:20:27] in the same anointing and In The Same
[1:20:29] Spirit in the same manifestation of
[1:20:30] power
[1:20:32] and so you find people who are satisfied
[1:20:34] and you see this is an evil spirit which
[1:20:36] is coming to drain the power of God out
[1:20:39] from the church to try and make this
[1:20:41] message powerless to try and bring it to
[1:20:44] a place where God is not moving to try
[1:20:46] and bring it to a place where people are
[1:20:48] not being filled with the Holy Ghost to
[1:20:50] try and bring it to our place where it
[1:20:52] is undermining the power of God to move
[1:20:55] in the lives of the people where it is
[1:20:57] undermining the power of God and the
[1:20:59] potential of the work
[1:21:02] where they will tell people look you
[1:21:04] don't have to you know to to preach you
[1:21:07] just come and we'll put a tape and then
[1:21:08] afterwards you will go home
[1:21:10] even they're making you know the tape
[1:21:12] weird couples they're even making depths
[1:21:16] evangelize out there they are making you
[1:21:18] know what is this this is not God doing
[1:21:20] this
[1:21:22] it cannot be God
[1:21:24] because Jesus Christ I know of the Bible
[1:21:26] amen he says it's the same yesterday
[1:21:29] today and forever
[1:21:32] if he sent Holy Ghost preachers in the
[1:21:35] beginning he will do it today he will do
[1:21:38] it tomorrow he will do it every time
[1:21:42] Hallelujah a church amen that we will
[1:21:45] believe in the power of God a church
[1:21:47] that you will believe amen that this
[1:21:49] message can be able to come down from
[1:21:52] the tape
[1:21:53] and be able to live in US
[1:21:56] one time I was
[1:21:58] I was you know just to prove to you that
[1:22:00] this message is alive I believe this
[1:22:03] message with all my heart and when I
[1:22:04] believed I was young but I I started to
[1:22:06] listen to the tips right away
[1:22:08] and I remember there is a one tip I was
[1:22:10] listening to I was in my bedroom and I'd
[1:22:12] close the door and I was just there
[1:22:14] listening and I had stomach ache and I
[1:22:16] had headache and I was not really in
[1:22:18] good in good health condition and I sat
[1:22:20] down there to listen to the message and
[1:22:22] and as brother Barnum was designing
[1:22:25] he preached of course the sermon and I
[1:22:27] usually love to hear until now I usually
[1:22:30] love to hear what he's designing you
[1:22:32] know what is that it is God vindicating
[1:22:35] that what he preached was true
[1:22:39] did you did you notice it is very few
[1:22:41] Services where brother Barnum preached
[1:22:43] and God did not vindicate himself
[1:22:45] in most of the services after there was
[1:22:48] a preaching you know you hear tongues
[1:22:49] after that I was preaching you see this
[1:22:51] element coming for you see healing you
[1:22:53] see this you see what God Amen
[1:22:55] confirming his presence in his people
[1:22:59] and I believe that same that is the same
[1:23:01] God today
[1:23:03] and brother Barnum you know what as I
[1:23:05] was listening I used I usually love that
[1:23:08] part and I I was not in a good health
[1:23:11] condition
[1:23:12] and as I I listened
[1:23:15] it came to a place
[1:23:16] where he started designing people one by
[1:23:18] one and I prayed in my heart softly and
[1:23:21] I said God
[1:23:23] you know I don't know if you have ever
[1:23:24] prayed an impossible prayer
[1:23:27] Pastor I prayed I said God
[1:23:30] if this
[1:23:32] message
[1:23:34] be true those were the times that I just
[1:23:37] believed that I was on fire for the
[1:23:40] locations
[1:23:41] said if this message be true and this
[1:23:44] man of God be indeed the prophet to our
[1:23:46] generation to the whole world
[1:23:49] I was not there in his time
[1:23:51] but I want him to design me now as I'm
[1:23:54] listening I want him to design me that's
[1:23:56] what I prayed
[1:23:58] and as I was listening he designed one
[1:24:01] sister she left another and she left and
[1:24:03] then he could come here brother I was
[1:24:05] like all the time under expectation who
[1:24:07] do you call me and then that brother
[1:24:09] left and then he called this man and
[1:24:12] listened to me
[1:24:13] oh my I still remember that that
[1:24:16] atmosphere
[1:24:18] and as he called this man I just feel as
[1:24:20] if you know when someone called your
[1:24:21] name no matter where you I just feel
[1:24:23] like something jumps within you you know
[1:24:25] they've called your name so he said come
[1:24:27] here sir and when they came said yo you
[1:24:29] were a brother oh you're a minister
[1:24:32] and this was so far all true to me and
[1:24:35] then he said uh you you have stomach
[1:24:39] trouble
[1:24:40] and then he started explaining why what
[1:24:43] caused the stomach trouble and when I
[1:24:45] start to reflect on my life I noticed
[1:24:46] that was actually the same same thing
[1:24:49] and he said he began to pray to pray for
[1:24:52] him and he told him to lift up his hand
[1:24:53] so I lifted up his hands and tears were
[1:24:55] flowing down on my eyes and let me tell
[1:24:57] you friends at that exact moment I
[1:25:01] received my healing
[1:25:03] and it it only him you were healed I was
[1:25:07] also receiving my healing and he never
[1:25:09] mentioned the name of the man
[1:25:11] I believe it was on purpose because I
[1:25:14] had to listen to that and I had to apply
[1:25:16] it upon my life Hallelujah you know he
[1:25:19] says that our names were not on that
[1:25:22] book and he says not like Joshua not
[1:25:24] like you know we were right there in his
[1:25:27] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:25:30] this message is here to call your name
[1:25:33] this message is here to give you life
[1:25:35] this therefore what am I trying to say
[1:25:37] I'm trying to bring to convince you to
[1:25:39] understand that listen you don't need to
[1:25:41] negotiate with the Devil because God has
[1:25:45] given us a message which has everything
[1:25:48] that we need if we believe this message
[1:25:51] in his entirety amen we can see the same
[1:25:55] thing that was there in the days of the
[1:25:57] Apostles
[1:25:58] if we believe what Amen brother Barnum
[1:26:01] preached to us and we really not just
[1:26:03] understand it but believe it in our
[1:26:05] heart God can come and be made manifest
[1:26:07] enough you know I made it what is ours
[1:26:10] is ours and we must claim it
[1:26:13] hallelujah what is yours
[1:26:16] I want to say healing is yours
[1:26:19] I don't have to amen live here in benoni
[1:26:22] when I believe the message and I am sick
[1:26:24] and I am coming to church I'm going back
[1:26:26] sick no
[1:26:28] until some Believers are going to
[1:26:30] Pentecostals for healing who told you
[1:26:32] there is no healing here
[1:26:35] I want to say healing is yours victory
[1:26:39] is yours Holiness is yours overcoming
[1:26:42] power is yours
[1:26:44] Hallelujah
[1:26:45] some people think that this message has
[1:26:47] no power to make you live a holy life no
[1:26:51] that is a Lie from the Pips of Hell amen
[1:26:54] there is enough power in this message to
[1:26:56] turn a sinner into a saint
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:00] Hallelujah
[1:27:02] one day I was in Ethiopia
[1:27:05] and this prostitute came to approach us
[1:27:07] for business
[1:27:10] I was with a brother from Nairobi you
[1:27:12] know the brother Pastor mahere because
[1:27:14] you were in their Church
[1:27:15] and I was with his brother
[1:27:18] his name is Paul
[1:27:20] and brother Paul was in the world before
[1:27:21] he believed the message
[1:27:23] he was arrested and everything so I told
[1:27:25] him brother Paul I think you know how to
[1:27:27] do this brother Paul might be listening
[1:27:29] actually I don't know so
[1:27:31] I told him you might have more
[1:27:33] experience than I so can you please
[1:27:34] start start her so you started her and
[1:27:38] because she came to approach us
[1:27:39] we did not know initially but when we
[1:27:41] found out that you know this was her
[1:27:43] intentions so I told Brother Paul to
[1:27:46] talk to her and then so we spoke to her
[1:27:48] and then we gave her an appointment so
[1:27:49] she came and met us later on and and we
[1:27:52] were with her sister
[1:27:54] who had believed earlier
[1:27:56] and
[1:27:57] guess what happened
[1:27:59] you see like those two young men said
[1:28:02] silver and gold we have a Havana but
[1:28:04] what we have we give unto you so this
[1:28:07] woman wanted money
[1:28:09] and wanted an immoral life
[1:28:11] but what we had we gave unto her the
[1:28:15] following day we baptized in the name of
[1:28:17] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:20] after being a prostitute for more than
[1:28:22] 10 years
[1:28:24] now tell me that this semester you
[1:28:25] cannot turn a sinner into a saint
[1:28:31] to the extent that when we see people
[1:28:33] especially young people
[1:28:35] I'm sorry I have a burden for young
[1:28:37] people so I don't know I I I'm not
[1:28:40] looking at each of you so I don't know
[1:28:41] how old you are but you know what I want
[1:28:43] to say is until the young people you
[1:28:46] know no longer find uh peace to come in
[1:28:50] our message churches why
[1:28:51] because when they come and you know
[1:28:53] they're overtaken in the world and so
[1:28:56] when you know
[1:28:58] sister you can't dress like that
[1:29:02] well of course we believe in dressing
[1:29:03] well as believers
[1:29:05] but there's a better way in reaching out
[1:29:07] to a Cena
[1:29:09] Hallelujah do you know the better way
[1:29:11] is introducing to them the power that
[1:29:13] can change them
[1:29:14] Hallelujah
[1:29:16] you know there is nothing as good as
[1:29:18] watching a scene as someone coming to
[1:29:20] church taking drugs someone coming to
[1:29:22] church as a drunk and someone coming to
[1:29:24] church wearing trousers and watch the
[1:29:26] Power of the word transform them into
[1:29:28] the image of Jesus Christ
[1:29:32] there is nothing as beautiful as that
[1:29:34] and I want to say this is ours we should
[1:29:37] claim it we should not negotiate with
[1:29:39] the devil but you know we should do this
[1:29:41] and that no amen Holiness is ours him
[1:29:45] and the overcoming power is ours you
[1:29:48] know Rapture is ours how many believe
[1:29:49] that
[1:29:50] and I want to say Amen even you only
[1:29:52] believe in children they are yours you
[1:29:55] can claim them they are yours amen your
[1:29:58] children amen are yours your wife amen
[1:30:00] maybe if your wife is unbelieving or
[1:30:02] whatever it is amen or somehow some who
[1:30:04] are not married yet and they are praying
[1:30:06] and they're waiting and they are not
[1:30:07] seeing until they even feel that they
[1:30:09] are losing hope in the church they think
[1:30:11] maybe he's the church the problem or the
[1:30:13] past the problem let me tell you the
[1:30:15] devil is just trying to negotiate with
[1:30:16] you Hallelujah you must just believe
[1:30:18] that your wife is yours whatever she is
[1:30:21] believed for her God is able to bring
[1:30:23] her
[1:30:25] Hallelujah
[1:30:26] do not negotiate about it just claim
[1:30:29] whatever belongs to you never negotiate
[1:30:32] without because when you negotiate with
[1:30:33] him you are setting a wrong precedence
[1:30:37] now I'm going to give you an example of
[1:30:40] one brother who actually refused to
[1:30:42] negotiate with the devil how many want
[1:30:44] to see him
[1:30:45] just open with me the book of Exodus
[1:30:47] chapter 10 verse 24.
[1:30:49] and Pharaoh called unto Moses and said
[1:30:51] go ye and serve the Lord only let your
[1:30:54] flocks and your hearts be stayed let
[1:30:57] your little ones also go with you and
[1:30:59] Moses said thou must give us also
[1:31:02] sacrifices and banned offerings that he
[1:31:06] we may sacrifice unto the Lord Our God
[1:31:08] our cattle also shall go with us there
[1:31:11] shall not and who be left behind
[1:31:14] for thereof must we take to serve the
[1:31:17] Lord Our God and we know not what with
[1:31:20] what we must serve the Lord until we
[1:31:23] come hither
[1:31:27] here is a man
[1:31:29] talking of Moses
[1:31:31] who actually grew up in
[1:31:35] in Egypt you remember the story of how
[1:31:38] it all started with Joseph and how these
[1:31:41] these Jews came in Egypt and how later
[1:31:44] on they became slaves in Egypt
[1:31:48] and after many many years well of course
[1:31:52] they wanted to kill and Moses happened
[1:31:54] to be one of the boys that survived did
[1:31:57] you hear that he survived you were here
[1:31:59] because of a reason
[1:32:01] and I believe I am in this generation
[1:32:03] because God has brought me here God
[1:32:05] brought this message my way because he
[1:32:07] knew I survived for a purpose so that I
[1:32:09] can be able to hear it
[1:32:11] that go with God there is nothing that
[1:32:13] happens by coincidence this is not
[1:32:15] coincidence that right now I'm here in
[1:32:17] benoni
[1:32:18] or that you are here or that this is
[1:32:21] your pastor it's not a coincidence it is
[1:32:23] all designed by God before the
[1:32:25] foundation of the world and it
[1:32:27] everything God was bringing it so that
[1:32:29] you can be able to overcome because in
[1:32:32] every generation they are Overcomers
[1:32:34] they that shall overcome in every
[1:32:36] generation must be there they are you
[1:32:39] know you notice in the in the church
[1:32:42] ages it says to to the to the Overcomers
[1:32:45] he has a message to the Overcomers in
[1:32:47] every Church age in every Church age in
[1:32:49] every Church age so I believe in ours
[1:32:51] also there are Overcomers
[1:32:54] and
[1:32:56] here Moses survived death and survived
[1:33:00] to be killed and he grew up in the
[1:33:01] palace and after a while Moses now was
[1:33:05] representing the generation I want to
[1:33:07] say he was representing the generation
[1:33:09] over the Overcomers
[1:33:11] he was representing the generation of
[1:33:13] the people who were not going to
[1:33:14] negotiate with the devil whatever was
[1:33:16] theirs was theirs actually mothers was
[1:33:19] was so zealous that you remember how he
[1:33:21] took down that Egyptian and he killed
[1:33:23] him with his own bare hands because he
[1:33:26] he had that thing in him that what is
[1:33:29] mine is mine and nobody can take it from
[1:33:31] me and when he saw he when he saw this
[1:33:34] Egyptian you know trying to strike the
[1:33:37] the Jew he felt bad and I said no no no
[1:33:39] no no I can't let this happen brother
[1:33:42] sister business but don't be over don't
[1:33:45] out don't let yourself not out should I
[1:33:49] say out zero the word
[1:33:51] should be within the word
[1:33:54] Hallelujah and so this brother you know
[1:33:57] he had not received an experience with
[1:33:59] God he had not received the Holy Ghost
[1:34:01] that's why we have to be patient with
[1:34:02] some people sometimes they do things
[1:34:04] wrong because they have no experience
[1:34:05] with God but wait until they receive
[1:34:07] that experience you will notice amen
[1:34:09] that they will change actually when you
[1:34:11] receive the Holy Ghost you don't even
[1:34:12] need to trumpet it everybody will see
[1:34:14] your life you will change you will be a
[1:34:16] changed woman you change the younger man
[1:34:17] it changed the point change the woman
[1:34:19] change it man
[1:34:20] and so Moses you know was so full of
[1:34:24] zeal and he went out there in the desert
[1:34:27] and uh
[1:34:30] he met with God
[1:34:32] and when he met with God he came down to
[1:34:34] Egypt he did not come he came on a
[1:34:37] mission but his mission was not to
[1:34:38] negotiate
[1:34:44] and so as the plagues of course you know
[1:34:47] the whole story of the plagues and when
[1:34:49] they Heat and the Heat and the Heat
[1:34:52] the king or the Pharaoh the only thing
[1:34:55] he could think of was to negotiate with
[1:34:57] this man you know when when two armies
[1:35:01] uh
[1:35:02] uh each of them when both of them are
[1:35:04] like very strong
[1:35:06] and uh they feel that this Army feels
[1:35:10] like I cannot overcome the other army or
[1:35:12] I can overcome them some some place but
[1:35:14] then again I will have a lot of losses
[1:35:17] here in my own Camp they try to
[1:35:21] negotiate instead
[1:35:23] you remember the other time when uh the
[1:35:27] the
[1:35:30] Goliath came down and he said
[1:35:32] well send me your best
[1:35:35] I'll just uh when you win us well then
[1:35:39] we consider that victory is yours that
[1:35:42] was negotiation he was trying to
[1:35:43] negotiate with them you see and that's
[1:35:45] that's usually The Art of War they try
[1:35:47] to because you know nobody was going to
[1:35:50] beat him
[1:35:51] don't think that David negotiated with
[1:35:53] him he did not negotiate with him you
[1:35:56] know Moses I mean David came up and he
[1:35:58] said who is he who is he that can defy
[1:36:01] the armies of the Living God who is he
[1:36:04] that's why even David refused all these
[1:36:06] things they're trying to put on him
[1:36:07] because he did not need anything to try
[1:36:09] and negotiate with amen with this man he
[1:36:12] knew that what he had was enough
[1:36:15] he had Jesus he had faith in the world
[1:36:18] and by the bottom said faith has masses
[1:36:20] amen he had the word and we have the
[1:36:23] word today and this word is enough to
[1:36:26] overcome the devil and and at that
[1:36:29] moment you know when he's swung that
[1:36:34] stone it hit right in the head of uh in
[1:36:37] the head of Goliath because it had Faith
[1:36:39] behind it and so we will notice here
[1:36:41] that Moses the same thing when Moses
[1:36:43] came
[1:36:45] and
[1:36:47] Pharaoh tried to negotiate with him say
[1:36:49] Well now I think what we can do Moses
[1:36:52] okay I agree now because this uh
[1:36:56] pestilences and plagues and they're
[1:36:58] really so heavy on my kingdom and so now
[1:37:01] I'm no longer God okay now let us talk
[1:37:04] man to man let us negotiate now so now
[1:37:07] I'm requesting that at least to you that
[1:37:09] a man can go and serve you our God
[1:37:12] but for these children they cattle and
[1:37:15] everything that one can remain for sure
[1:37:17] but the rest Let It Go
[1:37:19] and see what Moses said
[1:37:21] he said
[1:37:23] thou must give us also sacrifices and
[1:37:27] bad offerings that we may sacrifice unto
[1:37:29] the Lord our God our cattle also shall
[1:37:32] go with us notice that the way he is
[1:37:34] phrasing his words he's not saying might
[1:37:36] could
[1:37:38] should he say
[1:37:40] avocado also shall go with us they are
[1:37:44] shall not and hoof be left behind
[1:37:48] for they all must we take to serve the
[1:37:51] Lord Our God and we know not with what
[1:37:53] we must serve the Lord until we come

[1:38:17] another Arab and claim them apply the
[1:38:21] talking of the word apply the talking of
[1:38:22] the blood and God is more than able to
[1:38:25] save them and redeem them and change
[1:38:27] them
[1:38:29] Hallelujah
[1:38:31] and this man believed that everything
[1:38:35] that they needed and everything that was
[1:38:37] theirs nothing should be left behind and
[1:38:39] in Exodus chapter 10 verse 8 notice he
[1:38:42] says and Moses and Aaron were brought
[1:38:44] again unto pharaoh and he said unto them
[1:38:46] God serve the Lord your God but who are
[1:38:49] they that shall go and Moses said we
[1:38:51] will go with our younger men and with
[1:38:53] our old and with our sons and with our
[1:38:56] daughters and with our flocks and with
[1:38:57] our head hurts we will go for we must
[1:39:00] hold a feast unto the Lord and he said
[1:39:02] unto them let the Lord be so with you as

[1:41:33] Hallelujah the message of Moses was let
[1:41:36] my people go

[1:41:39] message the message of William Branham
[1:41:41] is let my people go that was from God
[1:41:43] not from William Branham

[1:42:28] raptured you are being transformed into
[1:42:30] the image of Jesus Christ
[1:42:33] that's why you should not allow the
[1:42:35] devil to negotiate with you let me tell
[1:42:37] you this message is let my people go
[1:42:41] let me tell you it is not going to be on

[1:42:53] world not on the devil's terms on your
[1:42:54] terms

[1:43:00] world distance not on an education term
[1:43:01] not on a politics times Hallelujah are
[1:43:04] you hearing me
[1:43:06] there are many things there are many
[1:43:07] encumberences that actually bring us
[1:43:09] down politics you know the education and
[1:43:13] you know the the systems of the world
[1:43:15] the way they are fashioned and the
[1:43:17] tribalism and someone said do you have
[1:43:19] tribes here yeah
[1:43:22] in in our country in our country we have
[1:43:25] tribes and our president comes from one
[1:43:27] specific tribe so most of the people
[1:43:28] don't like that tribe now
[1:43:31] and because they feel the those ones are
[1:43:33] the oppressors and these ones are the
[1:43:35] oppressed and so you you feel like you
[1:43:37] know even here in South Africa you know
[1:43:39] you had our parasite
[1:43:41] we say we study about it all over and so
[1:43:44] you see these are the things that
[1:43:45] actually people you find even Believers
[1:43:47] putting themselves into those kind of
[1:43:49] things the devil wants you to negotiate
[1:43:51] on his terms
[1:43:53] Believers are believers all over the
[1:43:56] world we are not to be taken or
[1:43:58] overtaken by the spirits of politics or
[1:44:00] by the spirits of all countries we are
[1:44:02] supposed to be overtaken by one spirit
[1:44:04] amen the spirit of heaven and that's the
[1:44:07] Holy Spirit
[1:44:08] Hallelujah so Moses amen I want to say
[1:44:12] how to go and his people had to go but
[1:44:14] it was not going to be on Pharaoh's
[1:44:16] terms Saturn things he has but he
[1:44:19] actually has no choice but to let you go
[1:44:24] he has to let you walk into your
[1:44:25] god-given promises even even as I was
[1:44:28] writing this I said to myself yes atan
[1:44:31] has to let me walk into my god-given
[1:44:33] promises he has no choice but to let me
[1:44:36] go listen I was just a little boy bound
[1:44:38] there Amen in the Anglican church and
[1:44:41] the devil thought yes I'm going to take
[1:44:43] this young man his life and I'm going to
[1:44:44] ride it and I'm going to write on it and
[1:44:46] to take him here to take him there that
[1:44:48] was his terms but listen the devil did
[1:44:50] not know that he cannot take me on his
[1:44:53] terms how many you are here on the times
[1:44:55] that God has set for you
[1:44:57] not what the world has given you even
[1:45:00] Jesus said I give them peace not what
[1:45:02] the word gives them but what their
[1:45:04] father gives them let me tell you this
[1:45:06] message has come with a power amen that
[1:45:08] is so different from what the world can
[1:45:10] give you another Son of God you are
[1:45:12] going to make this you are going to
[1:45:14] overcome this you are going to overcome
[1:45:16] the world the Bible says that they that
[1:45:19] are born of God
[1:45:21] overcome the world
[1:45:25] we are going to overcome the world on
[1:45:27] our terms
[1:45:29] Hallelujah on our times not on the
[1:45:33] devil's terms
[1:45:36] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:45:42] Exodus 12.
[1:45:44] I wanted to look at that
[1:45:46] and Pharaoh rose up in the night and he
[1:45:49] he and all his servants and all the
[1:45:51] Egyptians
[1:45:54] and there was a great cry in Egypt
[1:45:57] for there was not a house where there
[1:45:59] was not one dead
[1:46:01] and he called for Moses and Aaron by
[1:46:03] night and said Raisa and get you forth
[1:46:06] from among my people both ye and the
[1:46:09] children of Israel and go and serve the
[1:46:11] Lord as ye have said
[1:46:14] huh
[1:46:16] I want you to see the agency that with
[1:46:18] which this man is speaking what was
[1:46:20] happening with him at first he thought
[1:46:23] he was God
[1:46:24] do you know that some people they look
[1:46:27] for jobs and they don't find jobs
[1:46:31] and they said well you can't get job a
[1:46:34] job without corruption you have to do
[1:46:36] something in order to get a job but let
[1:46:38] me tell you you have to learn that a
[1:46:41] Believer if you know who you are you
[1:46:43] should never negotiate with the Devil
[1:46:45] whatever you are going to get you should
[1:46:47] get it on your terms it should be the
[1:46:50] devil to bow down to you not you to bow
[1:46:52] down to him you see here this man who
[1:46:56] was sitting up there like God himself
[1:46:59] now he is the one coming down here and
[1:47:01] he's saying uh hey please hey please
[1:47:04] raise up and get get you forth from
[1:47:07] among my people go go go go go you and
[1:47:09] your children oh they should not be said
[1:47:11] go go and serve the Lord as you have
[1:47:13] said did you hear that as you have said
[1:47:19] and then he said
[1:47:21] that was not all versator 2. also take
[1:47:25] your flocks and your hearts
[1:47:28] as ye have said
[1:47:31] and be gone and bless me also
[1:47:34] and the Egyptians were urgent upon the
[1:47:37] people they were urgents upon the people
[1:47:39] that they might send them out of the
[1:47:42] land in haste for they said we will all
[1:47:46] be dead men imagine the devil trying to
[1:47:50] release you to trying to let your
[1:47:52] blessing go try and let your Victory go
[1:47:54] because he knows he will be dead if he
[1:47:58] doesn't do that
[1:48:01] because he knows he cannot negotiate
[1:48:04] with a believer
[1:48:07] and the people took their Duff before it
[1:48:10] was leaving their needing troughs being
[1:48:12] bound up in their clothes upon their
[1:48:15] shoulders and the children of Israel did
[1:48:16] according to the word of Moses and they
[1:48:18] borrowed of the Egyptians Jewelers of
[1:48:21] silver and jewels of God and Raymond and
[1:48:23] the lord gave the people favor in the
[1:48:26] sight of the Egyptians
[1:48:28] so that they lent unto them such things
[1:48:30] as they required and they spoiled the
[1:48:33] Egyptians and the children of Israel
[1:48:35] Janet from Ramesses to suck off about
[1:48:37] 600 000 on foot that were men beside
[1:48:41] children
[1:48:42] that is going to happen but on your
[1:48:45] terms
[1:48:46] Hallelujah maybe somebody's dozing tell
[1:48:49] your neighbor on your terms
[1:48:51] come on tell your neighbor on your time
[1:48:53] it's going to happen on your terms it's
[1:48:55] going to happen on our times
[1:48:59] the devil has no legal right and but the
[1:49:02] bottom says here but brother when you
[1:49:03] get a courage enough to step out toy to
[1:49:06] toi line with the devil and cut him off

[1:49:12] deed for my house if I went in there and
[1:49:15] someone was laying there drinking and
[1:49:16] carrying on and doing uh wrong I would
[1:49:19] say you will have to get out my friend
[1:49:21] well this is a house for human beings
[1:49:23] you would say I I've got a right to be
[1:49:25] in here then I would say you do not I
[1:49:27] possess this house it's mine you see the
[1:49:30] devil will bring you all sorts of things
[1:49:31] sickness that I will bring you
[1:49:32] depressions listen there is some demons
[1:49:35] that the devil is using As Weapons
[1:49:37] against the children of God in our time
[1:49:39] now ah depressions
[1:49:42] you know he's using this against
[1:49:44] Believers but let me tell you depression
[1:49:47] is one of the most stubborn demons it
[1:49:50] comes unto men's Believers you know they
[1:49:53] are depressed and they are oppressed by
[1:49:54] the by by the kingdom of darkness and
[1:49:57] maybe some of them don't know you feel
[1:49:59] your Joys has gone and you no longer

[1:50:09] you it's a devil
[1:50:11] but let me tell you here like brother
[1:50:14] but I'm saying here when you find that
[1:50:16] devil on your property you have a right
[1:50:18] to tell them listen you have no right to
[1:50:21] be here
[1:50:24] and then they will tell you well I have
[1:50:26] a right then you would say no I possess
[1:50:28] this house it is mine
[1:50:31] where you would say gonna write just
[1:50:33] like sickness under the body of sin or
[1:50:35] whatever it is say where the other one
[1:50:36] bring the other ones drink the other
[1:50:39] ones do this or the others this way but
[1:50:41] he has no legal rights the devil has no
[1:50:44] legal rights
[1:50:47] the devil has no legal rights to bring
[1:50:49] you a tormenting spirit
[1:50:52] did you know that people can come and be
[1:50:54] in church and be seated in church and
[1:50:56] you know enjoy the world but when they
[1:50:59] have tormenting Spirits spirits that are
[1:51:01] tormenting them because the devil the
[1:51:03] devil realizes that he cannot actually
[1:51:06] Hinder
[1:51:07] the purpose of God for your life so what
[1:51:09] does it do he tries to delay your
[1:51:12] breakthrough he tries to divert you he
[1:51:15] tries to confuse you he tries to bring
[1:51:17] in things maybe in your home or in your
[1:51:20] family that will try to take you away
[1:51:22] from the the things you should be
[1:51:24] looking at you see it it tries to do
[1:51:28] that but listen I want to tell you
[1:51:29] tonight the devil has no legal rights
[1:51:33] Hallelujah bear with me a few more
[1:51:35] minutes he says and I couldn't I could
[1:51:37] take my abstract deed and go down to the
[1:51:39] courts and say look here someone has
[1:51:42] moved in here that doesn't belong here
[1:51:44] this is mine it belongs to me and the
[1:51:46] law would come up and put them out
[1:51:49] because I have an abstract written deed
[1:51:52] to that property
[1:51:53] brother and sister Hallelujah we have an
[1:51:57] abstract written date tonight we have an
[1:52:00] abstract to Salvation
[1:52:02] we have an upside to Divine Healing and
[1:52:05] the devil's has not right
[1:52:08] oh Hallelujah
[1:52:10] trust God and the Holy Ghost to put him
[1:52:14] out that's all amen say I feel religious
[1:52:17] tonight somehow I really do all right
[1:52:19] the devil has no right how many feel
[1:52:21] good about that
[1:52:24] when I was reading that and I thought
[1:52:26] about my life I said yes
[1:52:28] the devil has no rights
[1:52:31] he can try to put in something in your
[1:52:34] home in your life even in the church but
[1:52:36] let me tell you the devil cannot span
[1:52:39] because he has no legal rights
[1:52:43] to torment the church to take them away
[1:52:45] from their birthrights the Devil by the
[1:52:48] bottom says he's a bluff don't worry as
[1:52:49] soon as you make your decision the devil
[1:52:51] is going to give you a shock don't worry
[1:52:53] he's the biggest Bluff I know of but he
[1:52:56] is the only he is only a bluff did you
[1:52:59] hear me he is a bluff he says that's all
[1:53:01] he is
[1:53:03] he ain't got one legal power
[1:53:06] Jesus Christ stripped him of everything
[1:53:09] he had on Calvary
[1:53:11] the full sin penalty was paid at Calvary
[1:53:14] and the devil has no legal rights at all
[1:53:19] what is there left for a believer
[1:53:23] if we can know who we are where we are
[1:53:27] standing there is a song that says
[1:53:29] Standing on the Promises of God
[1:53:32] you know sometimes you know when you
[1:53:34] travel different places and you know
[1:53:37] things that others know and you you know
[1:53:39] songs that they know you know things
[1:53:40] that they know you you say Amen to the
[1:53:43] same things you really believe the
[1:53:44] Rapture is going to happen the heaven is
[1:53:47] surely there it must be there surely you
[1:53:49] know recently a brother came a brother
[1:53:52] came from Sweden to our fellowship and
[1:53:54] and I didn't even know he was a minister
[1:53:57] only to find out he's a pastor so I
[1:53:58] asked him to minister to us and and when
[1:54:00] he got to preach he preached exactly
[1:54:03] what I wanted to preach and he was
[1:54:05] speaking exactly what he was in the
[1:54:06] church and no one knew
[1:54:08] you see what is that it is to prove that
[1:54:10] these things are real and God is real
[1:54:12] and Heaven is real and the message is
[1:54:14] real and the Rapture is real and the
[1:54:15] holy ghost is real God is real
[1:54:19] and therefore we as Believers must just
[1:54:21] realize who we are and our ground amen
[1:54:25] if we can stand our ground and not
[1:54:27] accept negotiate with the devil this is
[1:54:29] what I'm sure you your pastor is ready
[1:54:30] to you many many times but let me just
[1:54:32] rehearse a little bit as we finish here
[1:54:34] he says now remember this Christ is the
[1:54:36] true church Christ in the true church is
[1:54:39] a continuation of the book of Acts how
[1:54:41] many believe that
[1:54:43] Hallelujah
[1:54:45] but the Book of Revelation shows how
[1:54:48] that the Antichrist Spirit would come in
[1:54:51] to the church and Define it the purpose
[1:54:54] of the devil the desire he has is to try
[1:54:58] and defile the church
[1:55:01] let me post there a moment the devil
[1:55:04] wants to make it a lukewarm Church
[1:55:09] the devil wants to make it a formal and
[1:55:12] Powerless charge
[1:55:14] where they will take things that
[1:55:16] actually are Apostolic and they will
[1:55:17] tell you that those are for Pentecostals
[1:55:21] where they will take the promises that
[1:55:22] God has given us to us in his word and
[1:55:25] they will say we do not need them
[1:55:28] the devil's purpose has always been to
[1:55:31] make us look warm for more powerless
[1:55:35] but this book exported Saturn revealing
[1:55:38] his works
[1:55:39] what is his works the attempted
[1:55:41] destruction of God's people and the
[1:55:43] discrediting of God's word right under
[1:55:45] the time he is accustomed to the Lake of
[1:55:47] Fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[1:55:50] he knows that if the people get a true
[1:55:52] revelation of the true church and what
[1:55:55] she is and what she stands for and that
[1:55:58] she can do the Greater Works the devil
[1:56:00] knows that she will be an invisible Army
[1:56:04] do you know what an invisible Army is
[1:56:07] which you can try to fight but you are
[1:56:10] fighting it at your own burial
[1:56:12] you will not win no matter what you do
[1:56:15] I don't know whether that is sinking in
[1:56:18] imagine the devil fighting you as much
[1:56:19] as he wants to fight you but he can
[1:56:21] never win imagine that
[1:56:23] he if he brings this you overcome he
[1:56:26] brings this you overcome he brings this
[1:56:27] and he keeps bringing more things but
[1:56:30] each thing he brings you overcome you
[1:56:32] overcome you overcome
[1:56:35] the True Believer of this message is
[1:56:38] actually an invisible Army
[1:56:40] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:56:43] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:56:45] Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:56:46] design and withstanded Antichrist spirit
[1:56:49] Saturn will be powerless before her
[1:56:52] imagine your enemy being there as an
[1:56:56] enemy but powerless
[1:56:58] can't overcome he will be as definitely
[1:57:00] thwarted today as when Christ withstood
[1:57:03] his every effort to gain power over him
[1:57:06] in the desert yes Saturn hates
[1:57:09] revelation
[1:57:10] but we love it how many love revelation
[1:57:13] with the true Revelation in our lives
[1:57:14] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:57:17] us
[1:57:18] but we will prevail over them we will
[1:57:21] prevail over every Spirit we will
[1:57:23] prevail over every demon that will come
[1:57:25] to fight us in our generation
[1:57:28] right now in our country
[1:57:31] how many have heard about the bill that
[1:57:33] the parliament has tried to put up in
[1:57:36] Uganda oh not many people are informed
[1:57:39] about it
[1:57:41] yes the the the the the it's called the
[1:57:44] homosexuality bill in our country so
[1:57:46] that many people are calling it
[1:57:48] Draconian or whatever it is to begin
[1:57:50] with it wasn't supposed to be there but
[1:57:54] I when I when I saw what our
[1:57:57] government is trying to do or what the
[1:57:59] parliamentarians are trying to do to
[1:58:01] protect what they call the culture the
[1:58:03] Norms of the people and at what lengths
[1:58:08] they can go to try and protect that
[1:58:10] I often wonder what do you think that
[1:58:13] God will do or not do to try and protect
[1:58:16] his church
[1:58:18] but with whatever they're doing actually
[1:58:20] they can't stop what the devil is doing
[1:58:22] they can't stop it you see remember as
[1:58:25] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[1:58:27] be and these are the days that we are
[1:58:29] living in and this is a time that
[1:58:31] actually the son of man has been
[1:58:33] revealed
[1:58:35] we are living in that time where it was
[1:58:38] promised that Jesus Christ would be
[1:58:40] revealed
[1:58:41] as a son of man again and that has
[1:58:43] happened already in our generation so
[1:58:46] what are we waiting for we are waiting
[1:58:47] for the coming of the lord we are
[1:58:49] waiting for the rapture
[1:58:50] we remember I was speaking on the four
[1:58:52] stages of Ruth actually the only thing
[1:58:55] we are now waiting for is the reward and
[1:58:57] he says he's coming down and his reward
[1:58:59] is with him he's coming down to reward
[1:59:02] him and those that labored in the field
[1:59:04] of boys amen how men are waiting for
[1:59:07] that time
[1:59:09] and now what is the bride is supposed to
[1:59:11] do the bride is supposed to rest we are
[1:59:13] supposed to rest at his feet we are not
[1:59:15] supposed to negotiate with the Enemy why
[1:59:18] don't you stand with me on your feet the
[1:59:20] enemy wants us to negotiate with him you
[1:59:23] know I wonder here
[1:59:26] where you stand
[1:59:35] I want you to just take a moment and
[1:59:37] think about your life right now
[1:59:39] and the many times you've tried to
[1:59:41] attain victory over this
[1:59:44] and the enemy it would seem as if he has
[1:59:47] taken away and robbed you of that
[1:59:49] Victory again and you try again and it
[1:59:52] seemed as if it slips away and you try
[1:59:54] again and it seems as if he slips away
[1:59:56] maybe you've been negotiating with him
[1:59:58] maybe you've been wondering about what
[2:00:00] the devil is doing but I want to tell
[2:00:02] you that today you don't have to
[2:00:03] negotiate with the Enemy the devil has
[2:00:06] no legal rights
[2:00:08] he has no legalized we've had what the
[2:00:10] word said if if the true church can know
[2:00:12] who she is and what she stands for she
[2:00:14] will be an invisible Army now I want to
[2:00:16] challenge you I want to challenge you
[2:00:18] and put you to a challenge tonight
[2:00:19] before we end this service
[2:00:21] maybe the service was for you
[2:00:24] this little sharing tonight
[2:00:28] if you're that person and you say this
[2:00:31] is a Friday night and maybe I've been
[2:00:34] tired but I've heard him speak to me you
[2:00:37] know when the Lord speaks to you you
[2:00:38] would know you would know that that is
[2:00:40] his voice and he's speaking to me about
[2:00:42] this matter
[2:00:44] maybe if you are here
[2:00:46] and you would say
[2:00:48] Lord I'm tired of negotiating with the
[2:00:50] Enemy I'm not going to negotiate I want
[2:00:52] to take my stand on the world and
[2:00:55] believe for this this is the time it is
[2:00:58] going to happen
[2:00:59] you know it can happen right now
[2:01:07] so if you believe we shall pray together
[2:01:10] Lord Jesus
[2:01:13] this has just been a
[2:01:15] a little sharing Lord with your people
[2:01:17] and
[2:01:18] talking of your promises in your word
[2:01:21] and
[2:01:22] knowing that we are the generation Lord
[2:01:25] and you are raising our generation
[2:01:27] father and Ami
[2:01:28] of of people or that are not going to
[2:01:31] look back to the failures that are in in
[2:01:35] their past or in the past of them but
[2:01:37] they're going to look forward and see
[2:01:38] the promises Lord I remember when I I
[2:01:42] read of David Lord as when he came in
[2:01:45] and he found his brothers all shaking at
[2:01:49] the sound of Goliath and he was
[2:01:52] representing that generation
[2:01:55] that was going to overcome anyhow he was
[2:01:58] not going to negotiate with Goliath he
[2:02:00] was just going to come and take what
[2:02:01] belonged to him
[2:02:03] father Lord I know that there could be
[2:02:05] somebody here father Lord in standing in
[2:02:09] that place standing in that place of
[2:02:11] David tonight standing in that place of
[2:02:14] Moses
[2:02:15] how Moses claimed everything that
[2:02:18] belonged to him he knew he was in Egypt
[2:02:20] for a purpose he had been representing
[2:02:22] that generation that he would not
[2:02:24] negotiate with the Enemy but would know
[2:02:26] that look I am here I've come to possess
[2:02:28] nothing else I've come to possess what
[2:02:31] belongs to me I don't care the
[2:02:33] impossibilities I don't care the
[2:02:34] feelings I don't care what I feel what
[2:02:36] I've been told I don't care what the
[2:02:38] doctor said I don't care what Whoever
[2:02:40] has said but I'm here to possess what
[2:02:43] has been given to me by my Lord
[2:02:46] father I pray that they may receive it
[2:02:48] father Lord may you let that Faith rise
[2:02:51] up within their hearts to know that you
[2:02:54] are more than able to come down lord god
[2:02:56] of glory and your word cannot fall to
[2:02:58] the ground
[2:03:00] oh Lord Jesus that they will take their
[2:03:03] faith and stand on that word and claim
[2:03:06] what belongs to them and possess it and
[2:03:08] how and say look I'm not living here
[2:03:10] without this I'm living with my victory
[2:03:13] I'm claiming everything that belongs to
[2:03:15] me I'm claiming my husband I'm claiming

[2:03:41] experience and an encounter with the
[2:03:43] Holy Spirit
[2:03:45] did you know that the moment you
[2:03:47] believed you can have it
[2:03:57] why doesn't each of us just have a
[2:03:59] little moment of prayer and a little
[2:04:01] consecration before the Lord and
[2:04:03] just consecrate yourself and say Lord
[2:04:05] Jesus I just received this and I believe

[2:10:49] it's got to be a generation of believers
[2:10:54] and that will be a generation of
[2:10:56] Overcomers
[2:10:59] a generation that does not negotiate
[2:11:03] doesn't negotiate with the Devil
[2:11:08] for the Devil is a terrorist
[2:11:12] the Bible says he comes to steal to kill
[2:11:15] and to destroy
[2:11:19] there's no negotiation with sickness
[2:11:23] there's no negotiation with atonement of
[2:11:26] the Devourer in your life
[2:11:30] many times I say we have accepted
[2:11:34] things we we're not supposed to accept
[2:11:38] because we like to negotiate and give
[2:11:41] Satan room in our lives
[2:11:44] but tonight I believe this message is
[2:11:50] you know is a pinching of the conscience
[2:11:55] to say Lord
[2:11:57] something
[2:11:59] as to give in that something is the
[2:12:02] devil
[2:12:04] he's got to give in
[2:12:06] because we're not living any hope behind
[2:12:10] we're not leaving any child we're not
[2:12:11] living in an old person
[2:12:14] they are all going to pass through the
[2:12:15] Red Sea
[2:12:17] and you are going to hold off the walls
[2:12:20] and far is gonna watch us walk
[2:12:23] nothing we're not living anything behind
[2:12:29] we will leave it because we want to live
[2:12:31] it not because the devil is saying leave
[2:12:39] I love you Lord
