driver katie wanna do right now i'm going to lecture today and they came and they were you know welcome it was the first time they saw they didn't know who is who nevermind and the driver had dressed like you know like a real phd holder driver quality so when they welcome there never came into via one d cup you know things that you cannot learn you cannot understand everything together so he was just speaking together and doing some science over there what he had seen albert einstein [Music] this professor professional professor driver professional motto was just putting physics into their minds physics and you just take you know some little water just like a real professor would drop his eyeglasses down like this nadine of god of indianapolis and the whole class was just you know it was paralyzed and after you know after after the session they started asking questions and they answered them very well and just when they were about to finish now for him to sit down there was a young man on the corner that asked a question that had never been asked before amen i mean when i'm talking about that driver i could do that for you that is you you'll get a cook you are that driver what do you like for you you have been with jesus long enough but the devil will never let you down [Music] upside down have you been in such a situation after you prayed you felt a breakthrough after you came to church here and you felt today if the rapture happens today i'll be the first to go no but after coming from a revival by the time you reach your guest you'll find that therefore waiting for you guru if i find favor before god i may be among the numbers but as soon as i'm standing right here god knows [Music] the the sweat started coming there was some heat in the body hey man i mean understood like i'm standing right now before i give you my what do you think yourself how how would you answer this question if it was you was asked seeing everybody mmm [Music] so for you to prove that it's too low let me take a sip of water your coriander and let my driver here answer you oh no i'm going to actually yeah i mean as i take a cup of water let this driver who brought me here answer you that person oh no driver he came and answered in a very short way hallelujah amen you have professor jesus yes and when you are not able to send amen i mean hallelujah amen call upon jesus in your day of trouble he will answer you right he is a master so this morning what is your impossible question in nature whatever brought before you the teacher he meant you to say like you cannot make it he changed it no you can make it or somebody amen and i'm here to kind of i don't even see where i'm going i've been in this message [Music] yes i know the word is true i believe the truth is here over there you see anyone coming in on 20 hours of nourishment and there was honey as well why do you don't be screened and they said that troop you are honey not have an expiry [Music] it ghost there is no expiration that life is continuous never flowing hallelujah so and we know all that they went through will know all personalize the door to the promised land would you be putting all the jerusalem and what is our promised land it is the holy ghost and what is the land of the holy ghost it is your possession in [Music] hallelujah amen armenia amen amen i mean there must be a calling why do you not buy or carry where the prophet is where the prophet is not be charity and he can look in the world he can wonder now and there's a time he cried to the lord over your cabinet after all the work we have done is this the product made in a different demo when she saw that to a american woman america dressed like a witch amen wonder is it all our efforts amounts to this he was in the condition of moses the whole crowd was [Music] amen so he took the reproach of christ and in this message of the hour there is a time of taking the reproach there is a time of separation is not the weakness of the ministers are we together to defend now this is the backbone of my message today you can see all the wrongs in the church you can feel like you're not prospering anywhere but now you are separated to christ you are united with christ hallelujah amen and christ will take you on your um and now he loved his brother living words somewhere living word one which come by one to our move and we call them all to come to my ear and receive their promise but praise foreign come on separated but yet he loved the people he took the reproach of christ they even took stone they [Music] caleb instead of caleb dying they're the ones who died but caleb was persistent he was passionate gumik he even stayed 40 more years in the desert amen but eventually he made it to the promised land regardless of how something can seem to sing songs it cannot amen we have billy graham prior inaudible but you cannot find all his preachings you can just find out for some portions of them but maybe they are not even more than 20 or fifteen videos and yet there were even more famous preachers than brother branham union of singapore they are robots they were all their great preachers but their summers were never recorded continuously because they did not have the message of the house they did not have the vision of christ in this generation amen amina now they finally entered the promised land diamond center and you see they started conquering [Music] is not selfish bless my brother instead actually the business seems like it's going down down down down ah and there is another brother who just went and bought something and started a business [Music] and then [Applause] [Music] of course we are human beings and we are exposed to this condition but after all the depression and all that conditions when your brother is being the bible says i believe that god is not like a human being he is not first forget the labors of life amen i mean you just do good do good just have a good heart tell god to give you a good heart come katunda home team you are stagnated tell god create me creating me the right heart lord um and give me the right spirit to focus the only true love of god with the children of judah he was not a child of judah but he was given possession among the children there is a day [Music] [Music] [Music] and just support only bbo and when caleb was there he was happy helping others but there's one day i mean the lord remembered often one to another and the lord happened and had it and the book of remembrance was written before for that before for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name is [Music] jesus for you my brother [Applause] i'm not looking at what's wrong you have done because that is your work is to surrender oh my god wherever you follow the voice of the lord oh god of remembrance before the face of the lord hallelujah hallelujah verse 17. after the book is brought before the lord the book of remembrance and they shall be mine says the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man's spirit his own son that serveth him then shall he return and discern between righteousness and the wicked between him that servant god and him that servant him not malignant [Music] is hallelujah because when the book of remembrance is brought to you by the table god only wants to see the good works in your life god wants to see at what is in your heart there please [Music] foreign give me my mountain amen give me amen i mean oh there is a time of praying one word [Music] spoke to jesus yeah you're gonna ideas you give me my mountain power give me my promise of young you promise this was actually no i need it if you don't you'll make me doubt your word we are afraid you know to tear and even sometimes we approach god actually with the fear that we have for for kabakka or someone else you know because these kings they they just always have a hard face so when you go to them you just think they can slap you away and we also paint a picture of a god who is ever hungry it just means respecting him referencing him in your heart of vengeance the same god of love he was born the lord and christ yes but remember that along the way he called his apostles so it's not all the time that you got to god like he's not burning fire there's a time of speaking to him as your big brother
