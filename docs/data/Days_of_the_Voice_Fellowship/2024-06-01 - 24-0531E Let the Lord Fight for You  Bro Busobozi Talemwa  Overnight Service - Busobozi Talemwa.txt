better the Lord shall fight for you and he shall hold your [Music] peace amen amen everybody say amen amen amen God bless you you may be seated I'm going to speak on let let the Lord fight for youen in the message God is provided way for this day the prophet says of course this is going to be a short sharing as we go into prayer he says and so is a genuine Christian you don't have to Baby him and part him yes and tell him this or that or the other he has he has got something in him the baptism of the Holy Ghost that throws all the rest of it off don't have to you don't have to beg him around because he is a genuine plant of God he has got something in him that was something in him that was a Christian fights for every inch of ground he stands on he must do that if he ever expects to exist and by doing it there is something in that takes care of him now brother bam here is talking about God's provided way and he speaking of a Christian not just a Christian but a genuine Christian he's saying that every genuine Christian you don't baby him you don't him you don't have to beg them to come to church you don't have to beg them to pray you don't have to beg them you know to put them on the back and you know make them feel good because because they are having a problem you know you are because you are having a problem you did not come to church you are not a genuine Christian because you don't have money you do not come to church you are not a genuine Christian I did not say you are not a Christian but I said you're not a genuine Christian because you know they do not pay you on time or because you felt you know a little bad about something and then you said I will not even go to church I will not even you know you know go there let let them come and call me and some people have realized one one person can decide to stay at home waiting to see someone calling him and if no one calls him he will say they don't even care I will not even go to church they don't even love me I will not even go to church you are not a genuine Christian the prophet says a genuine Christian you don't have to Baby him you don't have to part him you don't have to tell him this to tell him that or tell him the other he has got something in him a genuine Christian has got a baptism of the Holy Spirit it says that throws all the rest of it what does it throw off it throws everything the devil brings to him a genuine Christian is not is not is not someone that does not uh does not do wrong oh he's not talking about someone who is perfect no Christian is perfect in the sense of human Perfection but every every genuine Christian is perfect in the sense of God is perfection but there's something the prophet was trying to get to here he's saying he it will throw everything that baptism of the Holy Ghost in him will throw all the rest of it off you don't have to beg him around because he's a genuine plant of God you know a genuine Christian is like a like a a real plant that is not what is the other what are the others called yes but they have a name these days you know they they just make them in the lab and if you plant it it cannot reproduce itself yes it is hybrid yes hybrid it is hybrid is not original here in Uganda we used to have a lot of uh original Plants but you know some people came up with ideas from the West maybe and they brought it here I told people you see now when you plant this one you will have a higher yield if you plant this one you will become richer faster you see it's all about getting big things it's all about being richer faster it's all about getting plenty but when whatever you get out of it you can it cannot reproduce itself you have to go back and buy the seeds from them because those seeds are hybrid but what we had here in Africa what we still have but it's not it's not no longer as much as we used to have is we used to have original seeds whereby you know if you plant beans you don't need to go and buy seeds again you plant seeds beans and when you have vest you take out what we call seed you you you you you you keep a few kilograms which will be seed for another season and again if it is maze same thing if it is another plant same thing now because of the hybrid plants they are very weak they need to be parted on the back they look so beautiful and it looks like Brother Joseph they yield a lot but when you plant them you you you have to P them on the back you have you have to bring you know I don't even know what they they put on them you know it's called man you know you have to bring a lot of that you have to spr them you have to spray them you have to you know try your best to ensure that you know it doesn't die off is that right because it is hybrid but original you don't need to do anything on the original original is strong original is genuine original has that genuine you know genuiness in inside it original has Life original will reproduce itself original has a power within it that self activates in the same way the prophet is talking about a genuine Christian you cannot stay at home and way to be bed around when there is a prayer meeting because you feel ly because you feel weak because you don't have money in your pocket because of this and that you feel so discouraged and you decide not to serve God and you are waiting for someone to beg you please brother come you know God has something prepared for you please come we pray together just try your best you'll never know what God will please how many one that kind of encouragement if you are one of them you're not a genuine Christian the prophet is saying a genuine Christian has the baptism of the Holy Ghost he has got something in him amen that throws all the rest of it out no matter how you feel let me go before the Lord no matter what is going on around you let me go before the Lord I know God has a solution for me you don't feel like it but there's something on the inside of that calls for what you are receiving right now because you're a genuine Christian and he says he has got something in him that was amen hallelujah am it's not a lazy something the Holy Ghost is not a lazy something the Holy Ghost Wars the Holy Ghost Wars against SE the Holy Ghost Wars against your evil thoughts are you here with me don't just shake your head say the Holy Ghost gives you overcoming power the Holy Ghost gives you strength to come to church the Holy Ghost amen helps you to live above sin that's what he does he says a Christian fights say a Christian fight fights a Christian fights people don't understand why we pray sister fortunate I tell you why we pray because that's how we make war we don't make war by you know crying we don't make war by staying at home we don't make war by you know crying to our friends and neighbors we make war by prayer people can't understand why we pray but I'll tell you why we pray is because there is something in us that makes War a Christian fights for every inch of ground he stands on God has a lot of promises in his word for us but there is not of these promises we are going to receive by being lazy there is none of these promises we are going to receive if we do not pray amen there is none of these promises yet the promises are so many but we are here tonight to fight for every inch of ground we are here tonight amen to possess every inch of ground he says he must do that if he ever expect to exist if you expect to exist as a Christian be ready to fight for every inch of ground hallelujah amen and by doing it there is something in him that takes care of him and and because you are doing it tonight there is something in you that is going to take care of you hallelujah amen Christians we don't fight our own battles God fights our battles but you see we have to be willing to fight for every inch of ground and then he will take care of the rest of the Lord will fight for us and I'm here to tell you the Lord will fight for you praise the name of the Lord amen I read for you the other time about Joshua chapter 6 and we are going to read it again and then we read other two scriptures before we go to prayer Joshua 6: 1 now Jero was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came in and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given have given it into th hand Jero and the King thereof and the Mighty Man of Val and he shall Compass the city all ye Men of War and go about the city W thus shall thou do six days and seven priests shall bear before the Ark of the seven trumpets of rams and the seventh day ye shall Compass the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpets the priest shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the Ram's Horn and when he hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout and the wall of the of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend up every man

we're going around six times six days he on the seventh day on the seventh day you shall accompass the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpets the P shall blow with the trumpets this is the time the priest the priest is a preacher amen and he says the priest will blow with a trumpet and while you hear the trumpet of the Gospel while you hear the gospel being preached to the word of God being preached to you whatever God brings on the pulpit it is because he has seen the desire of your heart and when you hear a preacher preach about something and you say Lord that is me Lord that is me it means something is fixing to happen and they went around Jero seven times and and the priest blew the trumpet and he says shall come to pass that when they make a long bless with the arms hor and when you hear the sound of the trumpets how many are hearing the sound that the sound of the message of the hour the sound of the Gospel you know how many times were they six times six days and I want to say for six days six days before us six Generations before us six Church ages before us every every age one priest was blowing a trumpet Paul blew the trumpet it was the Gospel trumpet it was the message of Freedom it was the message for us to go and possess the land and then came the seventh rather the second age Iranians blew the trumpet then came the third age Mar then came the fourth theth Martin Luther Lu then came the sixth the and now we are in which age the seventh age there is something that is going to happen in the sevene Hallelujah he said in the seventh day you are not going to go around one time you are going to go around how many times seven times there are going to be several seasons we I do not know which season we are in but I know since brother bam was here there has been more than 50 years now more than 50 years but in in there has been several seasons I believe we are in the real last season when you see what is happening in Israel you Sur can see we in the last season of redemption God is fixing to do something for us we are just about to possess the land we are just about to go in the rapture we are just about to live this world we're just about to overcome we should not give up Brethren it's a battle we are fighting it's a battle with sin it's a battle with the world let us not give up let us keep fighting because we are in the last season because he said on in on the last day you about to go around seven times seven times and and he says it shall come to pass when they make a long blood with a Ram's Horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet when you hear the of the trumpet when who hears when you hear those that will be there in the seventh day we are right here in the seventh day we are right here in the Seventh Generation the seventh age we are in the last season of it and have we heard the sound of the trumpet it's a question have we heard the sound of the trumpet how many have heard the sound of the trumpet we have heard the sound of the trumpet sounding Jubilee we have heard the sound of the trumpet of the message of the earth amen what is it it's a great shout it's a great shout you remember what he said in the book of First Thessalonians the Lord himself shall descend with how many things three things number one he shall descend with a shout amen amen with a shout what is a shout anybody know what the sh the prophet that's why we should read the message friends if you read the message you will enjoy the preaching more amen amen let us have the appetite for the message what is the shout it says the shout is the message that goes for first already we in by already we in the Rapture how many knew that we in the Rapture the Rapture is going on right now the rapt started many years ago if you believe it shout amen the Rapture started with a shout what is a shout the shout is the m That Goes Forth by the messenger of the age it's the same thing called The Midnight Cry you know when everybody was asleep there was a shout that went forth you know you know to to tell them to wake up and their LS let me tell you we are we have already had the shout this end time message is the shout the the shout has already gone forth and now it is the time for the voice now it is the time for The Voice what is the voice the bride is the voice we let me tell you we only waiting for the last pH to happen and that last phase is the trumpet of God and that's why we sing a song and we say when the trumpet of God shall sound amen then we shall rise the day in ch shall rise and then we which are alive and remain shall be changed to meet the Lord in the air so we are waiting for that last moment praise God hallelujah but now he say here I wish we had enough time because I would quote all these things for you but then here he says when you go around then you hear the sound of the trumpet after the seventh time then all the people shall Shout with a great shout all the people shall Shout with a great shout you cannot shout unless you have the victory you cannot shout unless you have seen something that has happened in your life what do you need brother what do you need sister if I tell you you now have received it you will begin shouting hallelujah [Music] hallelujah today you can receive it amen he said it they did not see it they did not see Jero coming down but they were told when you hear the sound of the trumpet when you hear the PRI sounding the trumpet when you hear the preacher preaching to you the message when you hear the word amen in your ears when you hear the word coming in your ears that is the moment for you to shout don't sit there and linger and wait the moment you hear this trumpet then you begin to shout then you begin to shout even before the walls have come down and as they and as they heard the trumpet they began shouting all of the people together and the wall of the city was still standing they contined shouting the words of the city were still standing but as they continued shouting and they continued shouting and they continued shouting did not doubt they did not look at their inability they did not look at their failures they they did not look at the impossibilities of the worldall falling did they look at they knew the trumpet had sounded therefore we must shout and as they began shouting the world began falling the world began falling the world began falling and the whole city had fallen down flat amen this is only one example of people that can obey God and what God can do to fight for you let me ask you a question is it the people that is it the people that brought down the walls or God answer me is said the people oh God God threw Down the Walls they did not even have to fight all they needed to do was to shout all they needed to do was to hear the trumpet and then watch God fighting for them he said the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace praise the name of the Lord amen and we see here over into 2 Samuel chapter 5 verse 17 and when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David King over Israel all the Philistines came up to seek David and David heard of it and went down to the hold and the Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of refin and David inquired of the Lord this is the thing we do not do many times David the moment he was anointed as king his enemies brought War to him his enemies came to make war with him did you know the moment you cross over is the time the battle begins did you know the moment you in the place where God wants you to be is when the war begins how many knew that you see here when the moment they crossed over the Red Sea and went over to the other side they thought they had suffered in the desert all these years this was going to be the beginning of War but God fought that war god fought that b for and we see here when the moment that David was anointed king over is that very moment the people heard of it and and and and and the Philistines came to seek David and and David heard of it and he he he went down to the hold and the Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of your enemy is not going to get scared of you and run because you are a message believer because you are a message believer because we are believers of this message we are number one target of the enemy amen and I thought some you know young people thought were telling me Oh because when we get married it means we've now overcome know and I would reserve some of this for the married couples meetings on Sunday afternoon do you know the moment you get married is when the devil is now more interested in you because the moment he get Eve was married to Adam Eve was married to to Adam and that's the moment the devil came why didn't he come before because Adam was there the whole time and the devil never showed up but after their marriage after their wedding that's when the devil showed up because he knew he was going to get the whole family and by getting the whole family he will get the whole genealogy the whole generation the moment you walk into the whe of God for your life is the moment the Devil comes to fight the moment you know you you become a serious believer is the moment the devil will bring water to you the moment you you you you know you begin you you drop your girlfriend and you drop your boyfriend that's the moment the devil will now come to you seriously more than ever the moment you believe this message and you are baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is the moment the devil will now come and spread himself around you those of you who are not genuine Believers the devil has no much interest he has no much interest he has no much interest if you know yourself if you're not a serious believer the devil has no much interest but the moment you become a genuine believer the devil will have a lot of interest in you that is when even things that we we never fighting you will begin ask some of these genuine believer they will tell you how much they are fighting but I've come here to tell you the Lord will fight for you the Lord will fight for you brother you won't have to fight any B the Lord will fight for you everybody shout the Lord will fight for me hallelujah amen glory glory glory amen and we see here David you know you know the moment he was anointed as king of Israel then the Philistines came they did not oh my just don't miss this they did not come when he he killed Goliath did he not come when he fought the other battles they did not come when he killed I don't know how many were they 100 Philistines or 200 they did not come but they came brother brother Baka brother the moment they came was when he became anointed as king over Israel if you are going through a battle any sort of battle it might be luck it's a battle it might be sin [Music] Temptation it might it might be anything else and you're going through a battle the reason is because you are anointed to overcome [Music] in every generation please listen in every generation there are Overcomers and to those of you having difficulty hearing me because you are doing you are doing you're tired it's because you've told your mind you are tired and it is but we are going to be here two hours this is like normal service so slap yourself and tell yourself you are not supposed to do all right so listen to me let's go back to this David was anointed and the moment he was anointed the moment he was anointed is when the enemy came in every age there are Overcomers if you read it says to those that overcome from epes toia there are Overcomers now the Overcomers who are they they are predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ there are people in this world today that are predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ now no matter what the devil will do no matter what the devil can do he will not hinder their transformation he cannot in because I'm here to fulfill a scripture I'm here to fulfill what was written about me I must be transformed I must be conformed to the image of Christ I am anointed to overcome you are anointed to overcome hallelujah oh my God I am anointed to overcome I am in this generation Amen to be a King he said there shall be Kings and Priests Kings and priest and says what does it mean a king what is a king a king is a ruler a king is a ruler Hallelujah we we must rle over whether the devil feels like it or not I must R over sin hallelujah amen there is another law that works in my body but I have another law that works in my soul that shall put my body under subjection and I must be a king over sin I must be a king over this flesh Hallelujah and be priests with God am must be able to live worthy and holy am and David was anointed king oh my I wish you get the Revelation here the moment David was anointed king that's when the Philistines came they all came around the valley [Music] there were so many why because he was anointed king was he King yet was he King yet well if you can't answer that then you can't answer that over your life he was not yet King but he was King how many understand that by the virtue of the anointing he was a king but he had not been enthroned yet physically so now listen closely we are already anointed Kings and Priests we are already Kings we already Kings over the world Kings over sin Kings over the flesh Kings we are already Kings you don't feel like it because you are not yet Seated on the throne but oh glory to God why are we preaching we are preaching to tell you who you are you are already King even before you because already anointed to be a king I'm already anointed to be a king and in this state in this place before I take my Throne When shall I take my Throne re 3 to they that shall overcome is talking about those in the age of the seventh age to them that overcome I will give Amen to them to sit with me on my Throne can you imagine the reward of the Overcomers of the is to sit on the throne that's when we are going to sit on the throne that's when we will know surely we have overcome that's when we shall surely know we were anointed that's when we will surely know we we were not only the bride we are the wife of the groom that's why we sing a song and we say we shall understand better buy and buy when we are there we shall understand everything we you will understand everything don't worry about what you're feeling those little things you're feeling because of of the problem here and there some of you can be so worried because you have no money I'm talking about that many times because I know I've seen I know my people they get so worried someone can literally get out of the spirit because they have no money get out of the spirit I don't even feel like going to church why I have no money I'm feeling bad let me tell you don't worry about the money just keep coming keep coming keep feeding on the word because when you feed on the word you will get anointed you will get anointed with the anointing that shall help you to overcome amen when we sit on the throne we will no longer remember the days we spent without money you will no longer remember the heart breaks you receive you will no longer remember the job they refuse to give you oh how many are enjoying this tonight hallelu you will no longer remember the day is a night to spend without eating you will no longer remember what your husband did to you what your wife did to you you will no longer remember what you never go and others because you shall have overcome you no longer Remember The Temptations you went through tempted and tried and you of met to wonder why it should be th all the day long many others living about us living so wicked and yet they prosper and yet you are righteous you are trying to live for God and they are not they are prospering and you are not prospering when you get there you will no longer remember all that you will Now understand it you will Now understand Hall you will Now understand it because you shall have overcome Hallelujah and we see here David before he could have his throne he was anointed and the moment he was anointed the never began to come sent his army all all the Philistines came around let me tell you we are like David today the moment you get filled with the Holy Spirit is the moment the devil will send his army around you he will not leave you alone he will send his armies around you but I have a medicine for you I have a secret to share with you today when David amen was surrounded by the Philistines and they were in the valley of RAF David inquired of the Lord you see that's why we should be here to inquire of the Lord he came to him and says shall I go up to the Philistines will you deliver them into my hand and the Lord said unto David go up for I will doubtless deliver thee deliver the Philistines into th hand that's what God is telling us to know when we when you come in pray Oh Glory to God when when we come to God In Prayer let it not be a dry prayer let it be a a conversation I don't know how many here have ever prayed up to a moment when you hear God speaking back to you you ask him things and he begin also answering back I've experienced that before and I tell you it is the sweetest environment you want to be in when you begin to go in prayer you begin to speak to the Lord you know you it is it is enjoyable you begin to talk to him and you begin to talk to him and you begin to tell him how you feel what you've been through your enemies around you Lord see this Spirit here see this thing here see this thing here I don't know what to do Lord what should I do should I fight it how should I fight it and he will speak back to you and he will tell you go up I will deliver that enemy into your hands amen hallelujah amen my my my my oh [Music] Hallelujah and and and and David came to a place called bism and David smart them there and and say the Lord has broken forth upon my enemies before me as the breach of waters praise the name of the Lord amen therefore he called the name of the place bism and there they left their images and David and his men burned them isn't not not very interesting when when the Devil comes to fight you and he runs so fast away from you that he leaves his images behind that he leaves his behind and when the brothers will see them they would just collect and burn them let me now prophesy to us whatever your enemy has been what is your enemy speak your enemy now speak your enemy poverty is your enemy sin is your enemy what is your enemy joblessness is your enemy what is your en you have no enemies Church come on speak your enemies speak your enemies don't fear your enemy maybe for for you is a spirit of Witchcraft say witchcraft is my enemy maybe for you there's a spirit of telling lies you say lies is my enemy you speak your enemy I'm here to tell you you are going to fight your enemy tonight in prayer and the Believers will capture all the remaining idols and burn them that's the fire of Believers that is in prayer they went to war we go to war in prayer David went to war with his man we go to war in prayer Hallelujah and the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the Valley of the and when David inquired of the Lord he said Thou shalt not go up but f a compass be behind them and come upon them against the mberry trees and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the malberry trees when thou shal thyself for then shall the Lord go out before theee to Smite the horse of the f and David did so as the Lord had commanded and SM the Philistines from G until Thou come to gazar I want you to imagine this friends that was the first time then the second time the Philistines came back again and sleeping all around and David inquired of the Lord the problem we have as beli we never pray we go to fight our enemies using our kind senses when you have problems you got to cry to your neighbors to your friends to your relatives when you have issu isues inquire of the Lord but we should always inquire of the Lord and the inquiring of the Lord is really prayer when you you feel that your back is against the war that's the time for us to go and pray and every the second time he again went before prayer and he said the first time the Lord said go preached a message presuming many Believers presume that God is with me even the first time I went to him when I was in such a problem it was still the Philistines that had come to me and he told me go so even this time I'm sure God wants me to not every time God will tell you to do the same thing he told the past God knows what your enem is plotting the strength of your enemy the wisdom of your enemy and God Alone can help you out of your trouble and how is he going to help you prayer prayer the first time God told him the second time God told him M wait don't go hold back put your men around and here is what you should do you will you will wait and when you hear the sound going around on the top of the malberry trees then you will know the Lord has gone before you to Smite your enemy that's why I was telling you that let the Lord fight for you this is how God fought for David and David was just going to fight but God had gone brother Dixon come and here was God and he went before him come here brother and go behind this brother walk behind him walk behind him that's how God wants it to be that's how God wants it to be God was ahead of him God simply told him wait because he God is not a man God is a spirit so how could David see God he could not see him but God made he told him he made a provision and he said there is trees here before and um you will hear a wind [Music] when you hear that now you can begin to move but the whole time God was standing come come come God was standing and David was standing but David did not know God was before him what do we do many times you as a human being you are seeing your enemies you are seeing your enemies coming against you and even if God told me to wait let me go and you pass God and you whatever you will find there all the suffering you will find there God will not be with you you will suffer alone you will suffer locally God will not help you brother you need God you don't need education you need God you don't need money you need God no matter what comes and goes stay with God if he tells you wait wait he said wait until you hear the sound of the malberry trees that is how he fights for you that's how he wants to fight for us and that's why we are here tonight to let God fight for us because we are inquiring from him when you inquire from God she will tell you what to do and and David was told to wait and then later on when he had the sound what was it what was the sound it was now God who had gone before him and then now he says now you can move now when you hear the sound God bless your brothers when you hear the sound and you you see it is impossible to defeat your enemy enemies Let Me Wait your enemies will still destroy you let us follow him he wants to fight for us God bless you let us stand amen amen when you go back home you read second Kings chapter 1 there's a story there I don't have time to read it for you but there's a man who did not allow God to fight for him you will read about him when he was sick he inquired of other gods instead of inquiring from God God wants you to inquire from me not to inquire from other and that's why we are here tonight so let's to and then we shall each of us go to pray amen and amen I standing on within the presence of the Lord in whom the wisdom of the ages lies For Whom the rain in of the Sea subsid The Living Sacrifice the only source of life my hope he's in the Lord from this time on and never more oh my hope is in the [Music] Lord forever more he tender meres come with every Rising
