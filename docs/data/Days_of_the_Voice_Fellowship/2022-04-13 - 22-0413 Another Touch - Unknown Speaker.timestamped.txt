[24:53] [Music]
[25:23] [Music]
[25:25] such
[25:37] [Music]
[25:40] and it reads summary watch and he took
[25:43] the blind man by the hand and led him
[25:46] out of the town and when he had spit on
[25:49] his eyes and put his hands upon him he
[25:51] asked him if he's so old
[25:53] and he looked up and said i see men as
[25:56] trees walking
[25:58] after that he put his eyes he put his
[26:00] hands again upon his eyes and made him
[26:03] look up and he was restored and he saw
[26:06] every man clearly
[26:08] makko
[27:05] your own interpretation of your wife
[27:10] it shall be a blessing to us
[27:14] jesus name we pray
[27:18] you may be seated in the presence
[27:26] uh you people are falling victims of my
[27:28] life
[28:14] you will not go unrewarded
[28:17] you want to go unrewarded
[28:22] especially
[28:25] i thank him so much for giving me this
[28:27] opportunity
[28:56] they took the blind man
[28:59] that jesus jesus took the blind man yes
[29:04] by hand and led him outside of the tower
[29:08] i want us to compare that
[29:10] with
[29:18] [Music]
[29:22] praise the lord amen he could not deal
[29:25] with us while we still in the world
[29:29] we were blind in the world
[29:33] in sin
[29:36] the king of this world had blinded us
[29:52] one by one
[29:55] take you by hand
[29:57] and lead you outside of the world now
[30:01] praise the lord man
[30:03] when he let you outside of the world
[30:06] see praise the lord man he brought you
[30:08] to salvation
[30:10] that was the first touch that he gave
[30:12] you
[30:16] because we were blind
[30:18] we were under the masses of jesus
[30:22] and it took obedience for us to obey
[30:27] we have not obeyed
[30:30] that we are not accepted to follow
[30:32] christ
[30:34] christ will not have anything to do with
[30:36] you and me
[30:39] why because he cannot deal with you in
[30:41] the world
[30:45] pick you out of the world
[30:48] and then
[31:01] now let's think like this second close
[31:03] the vertices
[31:04] if that blind man oh my god
[31:07] whom jesus led uh outside of the town
[31:09] yes
[31:12] because he was not seeing jesus in the
[31:13] first place
[31:16] because
[31:43] you think jesus would have opened his
[31:45] eyes yes
[31:47] praise the lord amen if he had insisted
[31:49] not to god see again
[31:52] if he had lost trust for jesus
[31:54] christ
[31:55] jesus was a wrong character
[31:58] yes
[32:11] praise the lord amen this calls for
[32:13] obedience
[32:16] he recalls for obedience
[32:19] christ demands for obedience from you on
[32:21] youtube
[32:23] the things of god are not understood
[32:25] using intellectual understanding
[32:52] you cannot discover the purpose of god
[32:54] in your life
[33:08] if
[33:22] they may
[33:44] things may not make sense in the
[33:46] beginning
[33:48] you may not understand the way things
[33:49] are going on in your life now but i'm
[33:52] here to tell you my sister my brothers
[33:54] one day things will make sense
[33:57] one day you will understand why things
[33:59] are going on in your life the way they
[34:00] happen
[34:02] i am telling you don't seek for answers
[34:04] for why things are happening in your
[34:06] life that way i mean
[34:08] do not look for answers for why things
[34:10] are happening in your life in the world
[34:14] one thing you must find out jordan
[34:16] is that are you in the will of god
[34:30] are you worshiping jesus oh you're
[34:31] worshiping riches oh
[34:43] and the bible tells us
[34:44] that when jesus led this man inside the
[34:46] outside of fire
[35:01] streets walking never abandoning
[35:02] anything it means he was not saying
[35:04] clearly
[35:06] now come to think of it
[35:08] if this man had saved from a second
[35:10] cigar now that at least i can see
[35:13] directly i have never
[35:30] when he caught when he laid his hands on
[35:32] him
[35:33] he asked him that do you see now
[35:35] he said i see men as trees
[35:38] of jesus
[35:41] he knew this man was not actually seeing
[35:42] well
[35:56] what will
[36:06] praise the lord and that is the way we
[36:08] saw when we just came to salvation
[36:24] praise
[36:26] [Applause]
[36:32] praise the lord amen where back in the
[36:34] world everyone said when you were in the
[36:36] denominational world
[36:38] you would sit
[36:52] it means you were feeding on worms
[36:55] that's not eagle's food
[36:57] that's not the food of all eaglets
[37:00] you try to eat the worms
[37:02] but you could not get satisfied with it
[37:05] you knew something was wrong somewhere
[37:07] oh man you are the world where you're
[37:08] about to anyhow you could not help
[37:09] yourself
[37:10] you didn't know what to do again
[37:13] you didn't know which path to take how
[37:14] many you covered oh my you were blind
[37:18] god had a provided way
[37:20] but you did
[37:48] how much you are blind yes
[37:50] you said no i don't see that voice
[37:53] but i can't hear it
[37:55] i feel i belong to that voice
[37:57] praise the lord
[37:59] and you walked by faith
[38:01] you came out of the catholic no fire you
[38:03] came out of that process protestant
[38:05] church
[38:05] you came out of the ph
[38:08] and you walked anyhow no america you
[38:10] didn't know where you were going
[38:12] you didn't know where you were going
[38:14] but inside of you you were walking
[38:30] praise the lord amen he brought you in
[38:33] jesus hallelujah
[38:35] why don't we thank god this evening
[38:38] has opened your eyes
[38:40] why don't you thank god
[38:43] that is
[38:57] praise the lord amen and when you heard
[39:00] this word
[39:01] the very first time you heard it
[39:03] your heart agreed with it
[39:06] you did not ask questions they were
[39:08] you didn't doubt in your heart
[39:11] in your heart you knew this is home
[39:12] momentum
[39:18] amen that was the spirit of the lord
[39:20] jesus christ
[39:22] it was a blessing to you
[39:24] it opened your eyes
[39:40] back okay
[39:42] you were in the denomination
[39:44] you were living in lies
[39:47] and yet you thought you were serving the
[39:48] lord
[39:50] you tried your best to please him
[39:53] and then somehow you could not do it to
[39:55] your business
[39:57] why because the flesh was still calling
[39:58] right
[40:00] praise the lord amen the bible says lay
[40:03] aside everything that easily be said
[40:06] your nature and run your race with
[40:07] patience
[41:05] it is not because you are better than
[41:06] them no
[41:07] by a single it is not because you are
[41:09] worthy for anything good no since your
[41:11] granny day children it is by the grace
[41:13] of god
[41:16] brother says
[41:18] you are here by the grace of god you
[41:19] want to write such a controversy that's
[41:20] because he had compassion on you
[41:23] he had mercy on you
[41:25] then he picked you out of a million
[41:28] days of all those people that were out
[41:29] there brother and troubled
[41:31] he decided to grab your heart
[41:56] ourselves you tell us the meaning of the
[41:58] paradigm
[42:00] jesus said
[42:28] amen i want to tell you this
[42:30] there are people who are predestinated
[42:34] i want you to accept
[42:36] that that they are those people
[42:39] that he knew even before the foundation
[42:40] of the world
[42:42] i know that
[42:48] [Music]
[43:09] we came to this particular
[43:29] [Music]
[43:51] he saw this man was blind he didn't know
[43:54] that was god
[43:56] he never needed that pool anymore
[43:59] he needed
[44:00] god now charity
[44:02] of healing
[44:04] he never needed water again
[44:21] you that was his turning point and we
[44:22] are choking god gave him that touch
[44:25] and he went home rejoicing
[44:28] praise the lord
[44:29] why did he abandon all those people
[44:32] and he came to pick this particular man
[44:46] amen if your heart agrees with this
[44:48] truth oh my god if your heart has
[44:51] accepted you to believe this message
[44:55] that is the proof
[44:57] that my brother my sister
[44:59] he touched you yeah
[45:01] if anything
[45:03] you don't have the ability to believe
[45:04] this word
[45:07] that is why
[45:09] the denominations will speak anything
[45:10] about it
[45:12] i think you've gone crazy
[45:14] why because
[45:16] they cannot believe the word
[46:08] praise the lord you don't need someone
[46:10] to convince you to believe the word
[46:54] is the word of god
[47:31] praise the lord amen what matters
[47:34] is that god understands you i am
[47:48] jesus promised yes that we are going to
[48:19] tuck it down your nose praise the lord i
[48:21] mean you are on that solid ground
[48:24] hallelujah
[48:26] jesus asked peter yesterday
[48:29] people say that
[48:31] near you they gave very many answers
[48:38] of the lord
[48:40] it is not flesh and blood
[48:44] who is in heaven
[48:46] let me tell you
[49:14] of agreeing with every single judge from
[49:16] this world
[49:18] you know what the world says
[49:20] the bible says
[49:22] he's coming for a church
[49:24] without spot or wrinkle
[49:26] every church
[49:27] that has eaten the word
[50:11] if there's still a spot in you
[50:13] god somehow does not agree with the
[50:15] certainty
[50:17] i want to tell you my brother my sister
[50:20] get to the monastery
[50:23] get to the honors bench
[50:40] [Music]

[52:22] of a certain man

[52:31] he got so desperate
[52:34] that he needed another touch
[52:36] he said i can't do without it
[52:38] oh look what he did
[52:40] he left his home
[52:42] he left the glamour
[52:44] he left the fancy building
[53:12] he went to the garden
[53:14] and he knelt down enough
[53:16] he cried
[53:17] praise that he cried
[53:19] he told god
[53:20] if you don't feel me what does it do if
[53:22] you don't feel me

[56:45] and led him outside now
[56:47] if this man had rejected this
[56:49] i am sure he would let him go
[56:52] praise the lord amen because christ is
[56:54] not an author of confusion
[57:23] the song says his eyes his hands are
[57:24] wide open
[57:38] i am saying

[58:21] it is about living a transformed life
[58:25] it is about being a converted person
[58:28] it is about taking a step of faith
[58:30] it's about leaving one spot and going to
[58:32] another
[58:33] open house it's about abandoning
[58:48] bible

[1:00:12] it is not a trial and error
[1:00:15] praise the lord come here it is not
[1:00:17] gambling

[1:00:59] you've wandered away from him
[1:01:02] far from him
[1:01:03] and he's been bleeding
[1:01:05] he has never stopped
[1:01:07] he's still pleading even up to now

[1:51:10] i posted something on that about that on
[1:51:12] the on the what's up group i'm sure you
[1:51:13] have already seen it
[1:51:15] so
[1:51:16] we have decided to go as a church
[1:51:22] so those of you
[1:51:24] who have your own cars the
[1:51:25] transportation means my body name in

[1:53:09] prepare to go with something
[1:53:17] you know

[1:53:20] but you will need to take care of
[1:53:21] yourself
[1:53:43] whatever you can grab
[1:53:46] uh
[1:53:46] so and also changing clothes of course
[1:53:49] amen unless you're going to be coming
[1:53:50] from home going
