sick wife [Music] uh he had some problems some years ago that son got an attack was a demonic attack i don't know where i would be when this is [Music] [Music] but that's how that going uh it was that's [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the same thing as also okay she has all supported that attack nagaman [Music] i remember the scripture where jesus met the blind man and the disciple asked him who sinned yesterday [Music] that maybe god is where it's working his way out even yeah this song of mine is a minister in one of the pentecostal church there because and even his pastors never bothered even to go and pray with him nervous yes i was talking to him he was kind of busy but still i would talk to him i just request you to pray for me let us join prayer that we pray for him insanity i believe one of these days when the lord paves us away we will go and pray with him because i've always encouraged him that if you want to see god if you want to prove this god that god we are serving just believe this god man [Music] because the bible tells us [Music] and i just think that the pastors there they fear to be disappointed because uh how comes that you are one of the chief got problems [Music] and i believe that when we pray [Music] may god bring you disgrace [Music] until the day [Music] street as we sing this song [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen i just want to say that god bless you tagalog sir you appreciate the word by the martin martin i know that each of you can surely say that the lord has spoken to you in shamanian i just want to request you to have your seat for a few minutes and while our brother martin was uh preaching organization and i want to read it to you before we close the message we would see jesus 1962. where he says now the word is a seed now most of you brethren are here i suppose and you put a seed in the ground and the next morning you go out and dig it out and say no my corn ain't where is that part brother and you say my corn isn't growing yet you go back and see if it is growing it never will grow like that just over the cooler way do you know every time you dig it up you delay it it isn't that right that story was also appropriate and told us as much as naturally mr tortoise is slower than mr hair yet on it's not about how fast you can get it but it's about uh how uh you can make progress every day that's [Music] [Applause] don't give me the coat again and then you come and then you know you you you put your seed under the ground again the seed is sure it's going to grow amazing but if you you say well you planted today you say let me go in the morning i check it never what do you do you know the earth was made to grow the corn oh my god that is the purpose of the earth that's the purpose of your heart [Applause] [Music] it's not up to you to manifest the future it's not up to you to manifest the move of the holy spirit but it is up to you to commit that seed in your hearts i can't do this [Music] and then you go out there in the world the sins that may endanger it from growing or you could be living just keep on believing it i'm going to commit it to god makes it grow you all believe that any promise that god makes you you just plant it in your heart and say it's mine any promise expedition [Music] promise to you i've i've made a promise to you so every promise that god makes you but it's still young i don't know just plant it in your heart when you see them motivated and say it is mine oh god god gave it to me katrina it is mine god gave it to me catanda achieved can you say that it is mine god gave it to me he said by your stripes you are healed by my stripes you are and the devil will speak back and say no you will not overcome how how you can't agree with me and remain the way you are talking about corn crop as soon as you plant your core but potentially it is there now as long as you leave it alone we can strong and every word of god is dramatized by god [Applause] please please linger on along with me for a few minutes and let us finish this quote because it's really very important it says that's right don't keep digging it up now you will read it objection read your crop every time you do that just committed to god and believe it which way that don't look it is there and now he says now for instance say for instance i was up here on the mountain somewhere i'm a room that i had nothing to eat and before i could get anything to eat a loaf of bread would say um i would say a lot of a lot of blood would save my life and the purchase price of a loaf of bread say is 25 cents where somebody come in and say what's the matter about brothers why don't you get some bread no i'm a restaurant and then i would say i haven't got no money when a loaf of bread is worth it it's 25 cents yes sir but i haven't got twitter well you would say here brother i can be just as happy with the water in my hand to buy the love of bread as i will be with the love for bread itself because i have got the purchasing power for the love for breakfast [Music] just like there is there is the store all i have to do is lay it down and i get the love for breakfast so i can be just as happy with the quarter in my hand as i could be with the love of great because it is the buying power of the love for breath what do you need this morning right now i want each of you to speak what
