[51:17] Jesus how that song fills our heart with
[51:21] joy to know that we have got the power

[51:31] us through all the generation, Lord. The
[51:35] enemy has always fought, Lord
[51:38] Jesus, but your word is
[51:41] unstoppable. That's why we are here
[51:43] tonight, Lord, because you are
[51:45] manifested children of
[51:47] God. Father, Even now, Lord God, as you
[51:52] approaching the throne of
[51:53] grace, your word is
[51:57] dependable and we are leaning on your
[51:59] hand
[52:00] tonight. We ask you to have mercy upon
[52:02] us this
[52:04] evening. Come and cleanse us, Lord. Come
[52:08] and p each and every worer, Lord Jesus.
[52:11] May your word be preached in a mighty
[52:14] way, your anointing tonight, Lord Jesus.
[52:18] Heal those who are sick and
[52:20] afflicted in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:23] Christ. For you send your word and your
[52:26] word heals us and delivers us from our
[52:29] destruction. Father, tonight you have
[52:32] prayed. We are sending your word to our
[52:35] loved ones who are afflicted this
[52:37] evening Lord in the name of Jesus
[52:41] Christ. Father we rebuke every devil. We
[52:44] rebuke every forces of the enemy. We
[52:47] come against every yoke of the devil in
[52:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[52:54] Heaven father arise
[52:56] Lord. Let your enemies be
[52:59] defeated. May you come and bless us
[53:02] Lord. Anoint this
[53:05] service. Take me out of the
[53:07] way. Lord may you come and speak to
[53:11] us. Without you Lord we cannot do
[53:15] anything. But Lord is my
[53:18] desire that in this father hour we are
[53:22] here to come and minister to
[53:25] us. You know how fable I
[53:29] am. How weak I am
[53:32] Lord. But I'm leaning on your
[53:34] everlasting
[53:36] heart. You come and speak to your
[53:38] children. Those whom you purchase with
[53:40] your own
[53:42] heart. When Adam sinned in
[53:45] Eden, you kill an
[53:47] animal and you dress them with a skin of
[53:51] animal. But the bride of
[53:54] Christ, purchase them with your own
[53:57] blood. Lord, I
[54:00] surrender. May you come and take the
[54:02] full preeminence
[54:03] tonight. May you bless every listener
[54:07] forever wherever they are. Those who are
[54:10] streaming this service,
[54:13] to meet
[54:14] after those who are not here
[54:17] Lord. May you help them Lord. I pray for
[54:20] my family this
[54:23] evening. May the angel of the Lord visit
[54:25] them as well in the mighty name of the
[54:28] Lord
[54:29] Jesus. We have
[54:31] prayed. Amen and amen.
[54:35] Give the Lord a bigger hand clap of
[54:38] praise. Blessed be the name of the Lord
[54:41] Jesus.
[54:43] Amen.
[54:46] Do you love the Lord this evening?
[54:50] Amen. Amen. Yeah. I thank the Lord for
[54:54] the grace he has given
[54:57] me to stand before you this
[55:02] evening. I just need your prayers.
[55:06] Amen.
[55:08] Yeah. Bring greetings from our pastor
[55:10] this evening.
[55:14] Yeah. He's not feeling fine in the
[55:18] body. Remember him in your
[55:22] prayers. Yeah. But I trust he uh is
[55:26] streaming.
[55:30] Amen.
[55:32] Yeah. Praise be to God.
[55:36] Yeah. But we thank the Lord that his
[55:38] family is here.
[55:42] Praise be to
[55:44] God. Shall we turn to our Bible this
[55:47] evening
[55:50] and read with me
[55:56] in Romans.
[56:12] uh Romans chapter
[56:16] 8, no chapter
[56:19] n shall read from vers
[56:23] three. Shall we read in the name of the
[56:25] Lord?
[56:28] For I could wish that my soul were a
[56:31] cast uh a cast from Christ for my
[56:35] brethren
[56:37] uh my kinsmen according to the flesh who
[56:41] are Israelite to whom pertainth the
[56:43] adoption and the glory and the covenant
[56:47] and the giving of the law and the
[56:50] service of God and the promise.
[56:53] Who uh whose uh the father and of whom
[56:57] as concerning the flesh Christ came who
[57:00] is over all God blessed forever. Amen.
[57:06] Not as though the word of God hath taken
[57:09] not none effect for they are not all for
[57:14] for they are not all Israel which are of
[57:18] Israel. Neither because they are seed of
[57:21] Abraham are they all children. But in
[57:25] Isaac shall uh shall thy seed be
[57:28] called that is they which are the
[57:32] children of the flesh. These are not the
[57:35] children of God but the children of uh
[57:37] but the children of the promise are
[57:40] counted for the seed. For this is the
[57:43] word uh this the word of this the word
[57:45] of promise. At this time will I come and
[57:49] Sarah have a son. And not only this, but
[57:53] when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
[57:56] even by our father Isaac, for the
[57:58] children were not yet born, neither
[58:01] having done any good or evil, that the
[58:04] purpose of God according to election
[58:07] might stand, not of works, but of him
[58:11] that calleth.
[58:17] [Music]
[58:22] Crystal.
[58:37] [Music]
[58:51] to attend. And there is a
[58:54] way. Amen.
[59:16] forchech.
[59:47] [Music]
[59:53] [Music]
[59:58] [Music]
[1:00:04] Amen.
[1:00:10] Not of works, but of whom who calls.
[1:00:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:16] And I will call my sharing
[1:00:20] tonight. You have a
[1:00:23] purpose. You have a purpose.
[1:00:30] Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of
[1:00:35] God. Praise be to God. And that purpose
[1:00:39] cannot be defeated.
[1:00:43] Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:00:45] you for the portion of the scripture we
[1:00:48] have
[1:00:49] read and for other
[1:00:52] scriptures. Lord, I pray that you
[1:00:55] come take me out of the
[1:00:59] way. And Lord, may you take the bread of
[1:01:02] life and break it for
[1:01:04] us.
[1:01:06] Remember one time in the
[1:01:09] Bible he closed the mouth of
[1:01:13] lion. May you come
[1:01:15] tonight and separate me from my
[1:01:19] mind and may the mind of Christ be
[1:01:22] echoed to your
[1:01:25] church. May you close my mouth from my
[1:01:27] own
[1:01:29] words and may the Holy Spirit take the
[1:01:31] full
[1:01:33] prayer in Christ Jesus name.
[1:01:37] Amen. May be seated.
[1:01:41] Praise be to
[1:01:44] God. Amen.
[1:01:48] When I was told this uh
[1:01:52] morning that I would stand this evening
[1:01:57] I was wondering what I would share with
[1:02:02] you. Blessed be the name of
[1:02:05] God. But as I was in prayer
[1:02:09] praying, something came in my
[1:02:13] mind and I started looking at my
[1:02:17] life. Praise be to God. the things that
[1:02:21] I've gone
[1:02:23] through and indeed I realized it was not
[1:02:28] me. Blessed be the
[1:02:31] name. Praise be to
[1:02:33] God. But it's because God has a purpose
[1:02:37] in my
[1:02:40] life and the same thing apply to you.
[1:02:45] God called us in this
[1:02:47] journey. This journey has never been
[1:02:52] easy. Praise be to God. And I trust you
[1:02:56] know what I'm talking
[1:02:58] about. It will never be
[1:03:01] easy until
[1:03:04] rapture. Praise be to
[1:03:07] God. Christianity is all about battles.
[1:03:12] It's all about fighting the Lord's
[1:03:16] fight. Praise be to God. And the devil
[1:03:20] has a reason to
[1:03:23] fight. That's why he's fighting you
[1:03:25] night and
[1:03:27] day. The devil knows where he came
[1:03:30] from. Praise be to God. And he has full
[1:03:34] reason to hinder you.
[1:03:38] And let me tell you my brother and my
[1:03:40] sister, the devil will fight you until
[1:03:42] the
[1:03:44] end. Praise be to
[1:03:47] God. Amen. But each time we know that we
[1:03:50] have a
[1:03:51] purpose and God called us before the
[1:03:54] foundation of
[1:03:56] God. Amen. That gives us a reason to
[1:04:01] stand. The Bible says resist the
[1:04:05] devil and the devil will
[1:04:08] flee. Amen. The devil will not
[1:04:12] stay. As long as you resist to
[1:04:15] him, he will have to go. He says,
[1:04:18] "Submit yourself to the
[1:04:21] Lord. Draw near unto him and he will
[1:04:24] also draw near unto
[1:04:26] you." Praise be to
[1:04:29] God. Amen. Amen. And where we read, the
[1:04:33] Bible showed us that before Jacob and
[1:04:37] before Essa and Jacob were
[1:04:40] born, God loved
[1:04:43] one and he hated the other one. Before
[1:04:46] they were still
[1:04:49] innocent, blessed be the name of the
[1:04:51] Lord. But God being
[1:04:54] infinite he look through
[1:04:57] eternity. Praise be to God. He looked
[1:05:00] these two
[1:05:01] children and he put them on weighing
[1:05:04] scale and he show
[1:05:07] them praise be to God and God knew that
[1:05:12] Esau would not take birthight as
[1:05:14] something
[1:05:16] important but
[1:05:18] Jacob would even die for it.
[1:05:22] Praise be to God. And because of that,
[1:05:26] God
[1:05:27] said, God said, "I love
[1:05:31] Jacob and
[1:05:33] Israel. Blessed be the name of the
[1:05:35] Lord." God looked at the purpose in the
[1:05:38] life of
[1:05:40] God. Praise be to God. What keeps us
[1:05:43] moving in this
[1:05:45] journey? the purpose of God about our
[1:05:49] life as a reason why we are
[1:05:53] here. Amen. And that's what fuel us
[1:05:56] every single
[1:05:59] day and when we are beaten when we are
[1:06:03] cast
[1:06:04] down.
[1:06:05] Amen. Amen. Amen. But there is
[1:06:09] something within you, that pushes you
[1:06:13] that encourages you to rise and move
[1:06:17] again.
[1:06:19] Blessed be the name of the
[1:06:21] Lord. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. If
[1:06:26] you look at yourself here
[1:06:27] tonight, you are not the only child in
[1:06:30] your
[1:06:31] family, but you realize you're the only
[1:06:34] believer in your family.
[1:06:37] Because God had a purpose in your
[1:06:40] life and that's why God called you out
[1:06:43] of your
[1:06:44] family. That's why you are seated here
[1:06:47] tonight because there is a reason and
[1:06:51] that purpose nothing can defeat
[1:06:54] you. There's no that can put that down.
[1:06:57] There's no challenge that can put
[1:07:00] down and there's no way you will ever
[1:07:02] give up.
[1:07:05] Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Look
[1:07:09] at Abraham's calling. Genesis
[1:07:13] 17. After the intervian
[1:07:16] world, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:07:19] God looked into the whole
[1:07:21] world and saw man
[1:07:24] Abraham who was
[1:07:28] atheisted with the name of the Lord. The
[1:07:31] man who worship uh cre
[1:07:34] creation instead of the
[1:07:37] creator. The man was a moon
[1:07:39] worshipper. But one day God visited
[1:07:43] Abraham and told him to leave his
[1:07:47] country to leave his
[1:07:49] kindred to go to the land he was taking
[1:07:53] him. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:07:56] Abraham had not done anything
[1:07:59] good by the grace of
[1:08:02] God. Grace found him. The grace called
[1:08:06] him. Praise be to God. That same grace
[1:08:10] is what called
[1:08:12] us. Grace is what what is keeping us
[1:08:17] moving. Praise be to God. I think
[1:08:20] Abraham was not discouraged somewhere.
[1:08:24] He must have reached somewhere alongside
[1:08:26] the
[1:08:27] way and he was not seeing the land which
[1:08:29] God spoke
[1:08:31] about. He was not seeing that
[1:08:34] promise. Praise be to God. But each time
[1:08:37] Abraham
[1:08:39] remember that this God who called me, he
[1:08:43] has a reason the purpose of my
[1:08:46] calling. Amen. He kept on
[1:08:50] moving. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:08:53] If you look at God's
[1:08:55] election, it's
[1:08:58] amazing. Of all the women of the
[1:09:01] world, God called
[1:09:04] Sarah. Sarah, who was even
[1:09:08] buried, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:09:11] There was a purpose in her
[1:09:13] life. God's calling has a
[1:09:17] purpose. Praise be to God. God does not
[1:09:20] call us just for
[1:09:24] granted. Tell your neighbor you have a
[1:09:28] purpose. Tell that brother you have a
[1:09:31] purpose.
[1:09:34] Amen. I have a purpose. The devil knows
[1:09:38] that we have a
[1:09:40] purpose and that purpose must be
[1:09:42] achieved.
[1:09:45] purpose must be
[1:09:46] accomplished no matter what comes our
[1:09:49] way. Praise be to God. Amen. When God
[1:09:54] called Paul and one day they are in the
[1:09:57] ship.
[1:09:59] Amen. And the ship
[1:10:01] wrecked blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:10:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Remember before before
[1:10:08] they started that
[1:10:10] journey a man
[1:10:12] called he came and prophesy over
[1:10:15] Paul raise me to God and told him not to
[1:10:19] go but Paul never obeyed him. Praise the
[1:10:23] Lord and Paul started their journey.
[1:10:26] when they reach in the middle of the
[1:10:28] sea to
[1:10:31] shipwreck because God had a
[1:10:33] purpose in Paul's
[1:10:36] life. Nothing bad defeated
[1:10:40] him. Praise be to God. I'm here to tell
[1:10:44] you my brother, my
[1:10:46] sister, I just want us to encourage
[1:10:48] ourselves
[1:10:50] in that there is a purpose in our life.
[1:10:55] Amen. Amen. And that purpose cannot be
[1:10:59] denied when you look at the mystery of
[1:11:03] birth. What happened when you were
[1:11:07] born? Amen. That you managed to reach
[1:11:10] the finishing
[1:11:13] line out of the million jam of
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:19] life which came from your
[1:11:22] father. But you are the only one.
[1:11:25] who made it
[1:11:27] and the rest died.
[1:11:30] Praise be to
[1:11:31] God. And the devil make us
[1:11:34] think that we are just defeated
[1:11:38] people. We know what we are talking
[1:11:41] about. And we know where we are
[1:11:44] going. Amen. Amen. We have a
[1:11:49] vision. Praise be to God. We have a
[1:11:52] promise.
[1:11:54] We are people of the
[1:11:56] covenant. We are covenant
[1:11:59] people. And there's no way we can be
[1:12:03] defeated. Praise be to God. When I'm
[1:12:06] here to encourage you, we are going to
[1:12:09] make it. No matter what comes our way,
[1:12:14] we are called by
[1:12:15] God. We are chosen by God. We are
[1:12:19] ordained by God. We are guided by God.
[1:12:22] Praise be to God. Amen. When God looked
[1:12:26] through
[1:12:29] eternity, he knew that there would be
[1:12:32] confusion. Praise be to God. Amen. But
[1:12:35] still, he never left us
[1:12:37] alone. When he looked
[1:12:41] at many false
[1:12:43] doctrines, many false
[1:12:46] preachers. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:49] God in his mind, in his
[1:12:53] preparation, as he said in
[1:12:55] Jeremiah chapter
[1:12:57] 29:11, I know the thought I have toward.
[1:13:01] I have a thought of peace, not of evil
[1:13:05] to bring you to an expected
[1:13:08] end where you did not even expect to
[1:13:12] be. That's where what God has prepared
[1:13:15] for
[1:13:16] you. And he looked at this
[1:13:19] generation and his purpose in our
[1:13:22] life. Praise be to God. Amidst this
[1:13:26] confusion, he sent us the
[1:13:30] prophet and is guiding us by his
[1:13:33] eye, the eye of the
[1:13:36] prophet. Blessed be the name of the
[1:13:38] Lord. And that's what we are
[1:13:41] following. Praise be to God. You have a
[1:13:45] purpose today.
[1:13:48] We have a
[1:13:49] purpose that cannot be
[1:13:52] defeated. Blessed be the name of the
[1:13:54] Lord.
[1:13:56] Hallelujah. Amen. We are called for a
[1:13:59] greater
[1:14:01] purpose. Not something minor but a
[1:14:05] greater
[1:14:07] purpose. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:11] Praise be to God.
[1:14:14] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:14:16] And by faith
[1:14:19] we are going to make it.
[1:14:21] Whether the devil like it or not,
[1:14:25] we are going to make
[1:14:30] it. Amen. Amen. Because we know God's
[1:14:35] purpose cannot
[1:14:37] be. And we shall read in Hebrews
[1:14:40] 11. And we see men and women who had
[1:14:44] purpose in their
[1:14:45] lives. What they went through, but still
[1:14:49] God's
[1:14:51] purpose stood and
[1:14:53] prevailed. Blessed be the name of the
[1:14:55] Lord.
[1:14:57] Amen. Yes sir. Hallelujah. Glory. We are
[1:15:01] not going to die
[1:15:04] premature. We are going to be raptured.
[1:15:08] Amen. Amen. If the Lord
[1:15:10] tries, we shall rather we rather
[1:15:14] sleep. Hallelujah. Through the old
[1:15:18] age. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. But if the
[1:15:22] Lord comes
[1:15:24] first, we are going to be
[1:15:27] raptured. And that is the purpose of
[1:15:31] God. Praise be to God. God has a bride.
[1:15:36] You are that
[1:15:37] bride. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:15:40] The devil try through the
[1:15:43] ages can put down
[1:15:47] that. Amen. Amen. But that bubbas cannot
[1:15:50] be
[1:15:53] defeated. Amen. Amen. Praise be to God.
[1:15:58] That's what is pushing us every day.
[1:16:03] And that's what the devil has failed to
[1:16:06] understand.
[1:16:09] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:16:12] Amen. that even when he comes and tries
[1:16:15] you, when he comes and put you down,
[1:16:25] still because something holds
[1:16:29] you.
[1:16:31] Amen. There is a
[1:16:33] purpose why we are
[1:16:37] here. And deep in our souls, in our
[1:16:39] hearts, we we also know
[1:16:43] there are things you have gone through.
[1:16:45] You've gone through thick and thin,
[1:16:49] but you also don't know how you managed
[1:16:51] to
[1:16:54] overcome. You can't even
[1:16:59] explain. But it's because of the purpose
[1:17:01] of
[1:17:03] God. Praise be to God. Remember I was
[1:17:07] told when I was young
[1:17:12] uh my mother
[1:17:18] nearly almost died. Blessed be the name
[1:17:21] of the Lord. I was just of
[1:17:25] months and when they tell you the
[1:17:30] story you get emotional and even
[1:17:35] cry but now I know why God preserved my
[1:17:40] life. It's because God has a reason.
[1:17:44] It's because we are holding something so
[1:17:47] precious and that thing cannot die
[1:17:50] premature.
[1:17:54] Hallelujah. It must reach the harvest
[1:17:59] time. Amen. Praise be to
[1:18:02] God. And I thank God that
[1:18:05] today he has given me that
[1:18:08] grace that we are also giving the devil
[1:18:10] hard
[1:18:13] time. He wanted to take
[1:18:16] advantage when we were young.
[1:18:20] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[1:18:22] know there are many things which happen
[1:18:24] when children are being
[1:18:27] born. Some queer
[1:18:30] things. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:18:34] Hallelujah. Amen. But I thank God that
[1:18:38] evening. Amen. When I was being born, my
[1:18:42] angel was there. He was guarding me
[1:18:46] because he knew. Praise be to God. There
[1:18:50] is a purpose. There's God's purpose in
[1:18:53] my life. And he knew that when I get
[1:18:56] off, I will stand. I will choose serve
[1:19:01] the Lord in this wicked
[1:19:05] generation. Praise be to God. The same
[1:19:08] angel. The same angel of the Lord which
[1:19:11] protected Moses when he was sailing on
[1:19:14] the rear on river N.
[1:19:18] same angel protected you when you were
[1:19:20] born before you were born. He was there
[1:19:24] on
[1:19:25] God. Praise be to God. Amen. Maybe your
[1:19:28] mother had some some kind of
[1:19:32] sickness and that womb almost came
[1:19:35] out and the devil tried whatever he
[1:19:39] could. But it's time the devil tried.
[1:19:42] The angel of the Lord
[1:19:43] say it will not come out until you were
[1:19:48] born. And when you were born, still the
[1:19:51] devil tried by taking you in sin by
[1:19:55] doing this and that. But that same
[1:19:58] angel, he has protected you until today
[1:20:02] because the purpose of God cannot be
[1:20:06] defeated.
[1:20:07] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. The seed
[1:20:11] of God dwells in
[1:20:13] us, brother,
[1:20:15] sister. This is the time. It is your
[1:20:19] turn. The other time it was the devil's
[1:20:21] turn.
[1:20:23] Praise be to God. But now it is your
[1:20:26] turn because then you did not know right
[1:20:30] from
[1:20:30] wrong. You are living in sin like
[1:20:33] others. You are abusing like others. You
[1:20:36] are of sin like others.
[1:20:39] Hallelujah.
[1:20:41] But now it is different
[1:20:44] story. Now it is different story.
[1:20:48] Amen. You will decide by your
[1:20:52] soul to serve the
[1:20:54] devil to live unclean
[1:20:57] life. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:21:00] But one thing I want to tell you
[1:21:02] tonight. This is the time to revenge
[1:21:05] against your enemy.
[1:21:09] because now you know that there you have
[1:21:11] a purpose in your life and as long as we
[1:21:15] live that purpose cannot be the chicken.
[1:21:21] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:23] That is what keeps me going.
[1:21:27] I've been struck by many
[1:21:30] problems. Challenges
[1:21:32] come. They come and go. Trouble comes
[1:21:36] and
[1:21:37] go. Hallelujah. Sometime it comes and
[1:21:41] attack the whole
[1:21:43] family. But the grace of
[1:21:45] God has never fail us. Every time the
[1:21:50] devil comes
[1:21:51] like the spirit of the Lord always.
[1:21:55] Hallelujah. Amen. And that makes me to
[1:21:58] know
[1:22:00] you have a
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:04] purpose. Hallelujah. Even my children,
[1:22:08] they will live to serve the
[1:22:09] Lord. Praise be to God. And I know that
[1:22:13] devil will try whatever
[1:22:14] he will try to stress us. He will try to
[1:22:19] trouble my family. But I stand and speak
[1:22:22] like Joshua.
[1:22:25] I and my family, I and my house, we
[1:22:29] shall serve the Lord, all the days of
[1:22:33] our lives. And this is a time for you to
[1:22:37] make a
[1:22:38] resolution to make a stand for the Lord
[1:22:41] and say, I and my family in my youthful
[1:22:45] age, I will shout the Lord. All the days
[1:22:49] of my
[1:22:51] life, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:22:55] Amen.
[1:22:57] Praise be to God.
[1:23:04] There is two thing going on in the world
[1:23:05] today.
[1:23:08] Because remember the two seed which came
[1:23:10] from Eden.
[1:23:13] Blessed be the name of the
[1:23:15] Lord. Praise be to
[1:23:17] God. We thank God for Jesus Christ.
[1:23:22] We thank God for electing
[1:23:24] us. The Bible say before they even did
[1:23:29] any
[1:23:32] wrong, he loved one and hated
[1:23:36] her. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:23:40] When God looked into the life of
[1:23:44] Jacob, he saw his
[1:23:50] resilience. Praise be to
[1:23:52] God. And I believe God's
[1:23:56] smile. Say,
[1:23:59] "Wow." Yeah.
[1:24:03] This praise be to
[1:24:05] God. Say, "Yeah, I I love his spirit.
[1:24:11] Praise be to God. And no wonder when
[1:24:14] they were
[1:24:16] born. This boy was
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:21] restless. He knew very well that the
[1:24:25] Lord says the birthight was for the
[1:24:28] first
[1:24:31] born. Blessed be the name
[1:24:34] of. and he was looking for how he would
[1:24:37] steal that
[1:24:41] birthday. He knew that he had a purpose
[1:24:43] in his
[1:24:47] life. Praise be to God. Look at man like
[1:24:52] Abraham. Maybe it was an
[1:24:55] evening. He was there worshiping the
[1:24:58] moon. He's worshiping the moon. Maybe
[1:25:01] giving the
[1:25:03] sacrifice. And all of a sudden the scene
[1:25:09] changed.
[1:25:10] Amen. And here God called him for the
[1:25:14] first
[1:25:15] time. God spoke to
[1:25:18] him.
[1:25:20] Hallelujah. The moon could not
[1:25:23] speak. But that day he had a voice of
[1:25:26] God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. No
[1:25:30] matter what situation you are into,
[1:25:36] God, if you're a child of God, God will
[1:25:40] speak to
[1:25:41] you. God will give you
[1:25:44] direction. Blessed be the name of the
[1:25:47] Lord. He will give you
[1:25:49] direction. He will guide
[1:25:52] you. Praise be to God. Let us be like
[1:25:56] the
[1:25:58] Israel because we are the spiritual
[1:26:00] Israel.
[1:26:02] I was reading in the
[1:26:03] morning when the king saw that Elijah
[1:26:06] was Elishah was about to
[1:26:09] die. He went to him and
[1:26:12] inquired about their
[1:26:15] future. Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:26:18] about their
[1:26:19] enemy. Praise be to
[1:26:22] God. He asked the king. He asked the the
[1:26:25] prophet. I have come to inquire. I've
[1:26:28] seen your sicknesses unto death.
[1:26:33] Praise be to God because God spoke
[1:26:35] through his
[1:26:36] prophet. The word of God comes to the
[1:26:39] prophets.
[1:26:41] So the king knew that when this man is
[1:26:44] gone, they are going to be in
[1:26:49] darkness. And he inquired from him and
[1:26:52] ask him, I've come to inquire about our
[1:26:57] future with
[1:27:00] Assyrians. Blessed be the name of And
[1:27:04] the prophet told
[1:27:05] him, "Get an
[1:27:09] arrow. Praise the Lord. And
[1:27:16] shoot. Hallelujah.
[1:27:19] And the king did
[1:27:23] so. And he asked him how many times had
[1:27:26] shot the
[1:27:30] the praise be to
[1:27:34] God. And the king told him three times.
[1:27:38] They said, "What have you
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:44] done?" When God gives you opportunity,
[1:27:48] utilize
[1:27:51] it. Utilize it
[1:27:56] thoroughly. Because that chance might
[1:27:59] not come
[1:28:01] again. And the king spoke and the
[1:28:03] prophet spoke to the king and told him,
[1:28:06] "You will only fit them three
[1:28:11] times. Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[1:28:14] And up to today, there is still war in
[1:28:17] Middle East. Middle East because the
[1:28:20] king shot the arrow only three
[1:28:24] times. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:28:27] When you come in the presence of the
[1:28:28] Lord and when the presence of the Holy
[1:28:30] Ghost come down, brother surrender your
[1:28:34] soul. Amen. Tear your heart before God
[1:28:38] and tell God today is my day. Deal with
[1:28:42] me according to your word. Be according
[1:28:45] to your
[1:28:46] word. Take everything that you have for
[1:28:49] me because you don't know what tomorrow
[1:28:52] holds. Today is the day of your
[1:28:55] salvation.
[1:28:58] Amen. God gave the king that
[1:29:02] chance. But not utilized
[1:29:07] it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And that's
[1:29:10] why the Bible says from the days of
[1:29:13] John until this day, the kingdom of God
[1:29:17] suffered
[1:29:19] violence. Amen.
[1:29:24] Much as God has a
[1:29:26] purpose, much as there's a purpose for
[1:29:29] you, but still you have to do
[1:29:33] something.
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:37] Amen. Hallelujah. You have to go beyond
[1:29:41] the
[1:29:43] camp. There is something you supposed to
[1:29:46] do. Don't just say God knows
[1:29:49] me. If God want me to If God want me to
[1:29:53] go in the rapture, I will
[1:29:57] go. Father, you will not
[1:30:00] go. You have to do
[1:30:03] something. Praise be to God. Because
[1:30:06] when the angel of the Lord when the
[1:30:09] angel went to
[1:30:11] Sodom to call out
[1:30:13] Loot, if L had
[1:30:16] said, since angels have come, yeah, we
[1:30:19] are safe, you can guide us here and that
[1:30:24] settles it. He would have
[1:30:27] perished. Praise be to
[1:30:31] God. He had to do something.
[1:30:35] He had to listen to the
[1:30:37] voice. He even said, "But you see now
[1:30:40] I'm old man. I cannot run over the man.
[1:30:42] Let me go this
[1:30:47] side." Praise be to
[1:30:51] God. You must do
[1:30:55] something. I know they have preached to
[1:30:58] us. We are preachers have preached about
[1:31:02] this about the purpose of
[1:31:04] God. You cannot fail. It cannot be
[1:31:09] defeated. Praise be to God. It is
[1:31:13] true. But you must do
[1:31:17] something. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:31:21] Amen.
[1:31:24] You see if you read Psalms 10 say I
[1:31:27] encourage myself in the
[1:31:31] Lord sometime you need to encourage
[1:31:34] yourself in the
[1:31:36] Lord. You speak to this
[1:31:39] body. You speak to your heart and you
[1:31:43] speak to yourself and
[1:31:45] say my heart be of good courage.
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:51] Man knows what I'm talking
[1:31:53] about. Sometime you are
[1:31:56] pressed until you say what can I do but
[1:32:00] the Holy Ghost remind
[1:32:02] you can do something. Then you start
[1:32:05] speaking to
[1:32:07] yourself and you say no matter what is
[1:32:10] happening around me I am moving forward
[1:32:15] I'm not giving up. I'm not going to do
[1:32:17] that because the Lord has
[1:32:20] it me out of
[1:32:22] this. Praise be to God.
[1:32:26] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:30] But when you hear believers
[1:32:32] saying, "The way I'm so
[1:32:35] stressed, anybody should commit
[1:32:42] suicide." Praise the Lord.
[1:32:45] And even if you hold on when you are
[1:32:49] trick for
[1:32:51] me others they are
[1:32:54] okay. God will just look at
[1:32:58] you say look at this one with
[1:33:03] ammonia. Praise be to God. Even the
[1:33:07] people in the world they are
[1:33:09] stressed. They even have more
[1:33:13] trouble and they have nowhere to run
[1:33:16] to. Praise be to God. Yesterday one man
[1:33:20] was telling me that they came and stole
[1:33:23] his
[1:33:25] screen. So a friend told him there is a
[1:33:29] man I know. He just pay some little
[1:33:32] money within just two three days.
[1:33:40] That man uses
[1:33:43] peace to the
[1:33:45] arrest and the man will bring your
[1:33:49] screen and that man that man told me
[1:33:52] he's waiting up to
[1:33:55] date. It is
[1:33:59] yours. Uhhuh.
[1:34:05] And then in my heart see just what how
[1:34:08] human being can be
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:12] deceived. But I thanked
[1:34:15] God. Thanks be to God because I have the
[1:34:19] creator of the
[1:34:21] beast for him will not send the beast to
[1:34:23] bring
[1:34:25] my to him soul.
[1:34:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Then I remembered a
[1:34:32] man in
[1:34:34] meeting whose cars were whose car was
[1:34:37] stolen. When he was in the meeting and
[1:34:40] the prophet said, "Let us pray." And
[1:34:43] they made a prayer. And the Holy Ghost,
[1:34:47] the law enforcer went and convicted the
[1:34:50] thief and the guy drove the
[1:34:52] car. Hallelujah. Amen. And parked it
[1:34:58] somewhere and took off. And I remembered
[1:35:02] I remembered sister Ro's testimony on
[1:35:05] Sunday when her phone was
[1:35:08] stolen. The other one went to the witch
[1:35:10] doctor.
[1:35:12] The witch doctor is too weak to go and
[1:35:14] look for
[1:35:15] it. He has to send a
[1:35:19] creation. He has to send a
[1:35:22] be. But our sister
[1:35:25] prayed and believed God. And the thief
[1:35:29] brought back the
[1:35:30] phone. That is the God we are talking
[1:35:33] about. Hallelujah. This is not just a
[1:35:37] story. There is a living God in heaven.
[1:35:40] And that God is in our
[1:35:42] midst. Hallelujah. Amen. That God who
[1:35:45] speaks to our
[1:35:47] body and the sickness
[1:35:49] flee. God speaks to our
[1:35:52] problem disappear. The God who make the
[1:35:56] lamb to
[1:35:57] work. Hallelujah. And that is the God
[1:36:00] who called
[1:36:02] us with a holy
[1:36:06] calling. You are not on a guest work.
[1:36:10] You are here for a special
[1:36:12] duty. We are evil
[1:36:15] delegates. Hallelujah.
[1:36:19] Yes
[1:36:20] sir. God sent us on earth for our
[1:36:24] purpose. He has a reason why we are
[1:36:27] here. He has a reason why you are
[1:36:30] inongo. Why you are not
[1:36:33] in the reason why you are here.
[1:36:37] And you are in
[1:36:39] Uganda. We are special envoy from
[1:36:43] heaven. We are that
[1:36:47] envoy. Ambassadors of Jesus
[1:36:50] Christ. We are here for special
[1:36:54] assignments. We don't care what the
[1:36:57] devil is doing
[1:36:59] around. Praise be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:37:02] Amen. Amen.
[1:37:06] Amen.
[1:37:08] You find them driving those cars with
[1:37:10] number CD.
[1:37:16] Blessed be the name of the
[1:37:18] Lord as embassy.
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:26] Not just a honorable.
[1:37:30] These are delegates from another country
[1:37:32] who represent their their nation in
[1:37:35] another
[1:37:40] country. Blessed be the name of the
[1:37:42] Lord. We are the children of
[1:37:45] God who came from glory and God sent us
[1:37:49] on
[1:37:50] earth. Amen.
[1:37:55] [Applause]
[1:37:58] Yes sir. And we have come on earth to
[1:38:02] fight for our
[1:38:04] right because the mankind was sold in
[1:38:09] sin. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:38:12] But when Jesus died and he paid the
[1:38:16] price. Amen. Then sent men on
[1:38:21] earth. He sent men on earth.
[1:38:26] Then he say, "Therefore go into the
[1:38:29] world, preach the gospel. Whosoever
[1:38:33] believes and
[1:38:35] baptize, hallelujah, there are men on
[1:38:39] earth." There are men today who are
[1:38:42] living in sin whom the devils made them
[1:38:46] to think that they of this
[1:38:50] world because they walk like others.
[1:38:53] They go to market like others. They eat
[1:38:56] like others, sleep by like others. And
[1:39:00] they
[1:39:01] think they're like
[1:39:04] others. Praise be to
[1:39:07] God. But God chose you and
[1:39:10] me and sent us on earth to tell them
[1:39:15] that they are not like
[1:39:17] others. Amen. that they are eager.
[1:39:23] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:39:28] And by the way, eagles does not
[1:39:32] walk but they jump
[1:39:36] jump because when they walk like this be
[1:39:40] that they have the
[1:39:41] clothes they going
[1:39:44] to they will be holding grass around.
[1:39:47] Blessed be the name of we thank
[1:39:51] God. Hallelujah. Sometime even you lack
[1:39:55] what to
[1:39:57] say. Amen. There is something in your
[1:40:02] heart like Daniel of old who say I will
[1:40:06] not bow
[1:40:09] down because he knew the purpose he had.
[1:40:16] That's all we need to
[1:40:18] know because we'll stay
[1:40:22] focused to know that we have a
[1:40:24] purpose and there is God driving
[1:40:28] this and that cannot
[1:40:31] fail. Abraham old
[1:40:33] man because there is purpose there was a
[1:40:36] purpose in his
[1:40:37] life at his old age. God revived him.
[1:40:42] God renewed his strength. God restored
[1:40:45] Sarah's
[1:40:46] womb. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:40:49] Amen. Things may be hard today, but when
[1:40:53] the purpose is about to be
[1:40:55] accomplished, something is got to
[1:40:58] happen. And the devil cannot reverse it
[1:41:02] because it is God doing
[1:41:04] it.
[1:41:07] Hallelujah. Why does it take
[1:41:09] long? God follows the law of nature.
[1:41:14] That is his law. You can plant maze
[1:41:18] today and harvest tomorrow. But when you
[1:41:21] plant, you'll have to prune it. You'll
[1:41:24] have to weed it until the harvest time.
[1:41:28] Blessed be the name of the Lord. But
[1:41:31] thanks be to God that we are living in
[1:41:33] the harvest time.
[1:41:36] Hallelujah. Amen. where every
[1:41:40] story, every life is coming to an
[1:41:45] end. Blessed be the name of the
[1:41:49] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:41:51] I'm here to tell you, there is a great
[1:41:53] day we are waiting
[1:41:55] for. There's a great day
[1:41:57] coming. Hallelujah. Amen. The rapturing
[1:42:01] of the
[1:42:02] bride is going to take
[1:42:04] place one of these days.
[1:42:08] Blessed be the name of the
[1:42:10] Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. But let us keep
[1:42:13] moving on.
[1:42:16] Amen.
[1:42:20] The Holy Spirit is calling the bride out
[1:42:22] of the
[1:42:24] church and a church out of a church
[1:42:29] member. members from every
[1:42:32] denomination making up a bride
[1:42:35] tree. Bride is coming
[1:42:38] out. Call and call. Call and that and
[1:42:41] that is the one that the bride tree
[1:42:47] is. Blessed be the name of the
[1:42:50] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. One day
[1:42:55] Lazarus died. He became sick and Jesus
[1:42:59] had about he had of his sickness but he
[1:43:02] never went there because Jesus knew that
[1:43:06] had a purpose.
[1:43:09] Amen. And what was that purpose? He was
[1:43:14] going to demonstrate
[1:43:16] resurrection. The voice of resurrection.
[1:43:20] Hallelujah. Lazarus
[1:43:22] relatives, Lazarus sisters, they never
[1:43:26] knew what was going on. God knew what
[1:43:29] was going
[1:43:30] on. Hallelujah. He knew that purpose
[1:43:33] cannot be
[1:43:35] defected. And when Jesus preached that
[1:43:38] Lazarus
[1:43:39] grave in John chapter 11 vers
[1:43:43] 43, blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[1:43:46] Bible says, "And when he had and and
[1:43:50] when he that had
[1:43:53] spoken and he cried with a loud
[1:43:57] voice, Lazarus come forth. And he that
[1:44:01] was
[1:44:02] dead came forth and
[1:44:05] bh and bound hand and
[1:44:09] foot
[1:44:11] clothes. And his face was bound about
[1:44:14] with a napkins.
[1:44:17] And Jesus says unto them, "Use him and
[1:44:22] let him go." Hallelujah. Amen. His
[1:44:26] purpose was not yet
[1:44:29] done. And when he died, brother, you
[1:44:32] will never escape your
[1:44:35] purpose. Even if you take
[1:44:37] poison, the Lord will not allow you to
[1:44:40] go. Hallelujah. Until that purpose is
[1:44:44] accomplished.
[1:44:46] blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:44:49] When Lazarus died, he had a purpose in
[1:44:52] his life. And when Jesus came,
[1:44:56] hallelujah, and he called with a loud
[1:44:59] voice. And we know one of these days,
[1:45:03] that same voice, he's going to call out
[1:45:05] the dead again. And the Bible tells us
[1:45:09] and the dead in Christ they shall rise
[1:45:13] first. Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe brother
[1:45:17] will be in the streets
[1:45:20] of those who will be
[1:45:22] alive. They will change in the twinkling
[1:45:26] of praise be to God. Amen. Let the
[1:45:29] coming of the Lord find you in the
[1:45:32] rightful
[1:45:35] position. Amen. I pray that that day,
[1:45:39] let that define us in fellowship, let it
[1:45:42] find us understood
[1:45:44] somewhere, maybe on a crusade.
[1:45:47] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:45:51] Amen.
[1:45:54] Where will you
[1:45:58] be when the when the voice of the
[1:46:01] resurrection will cry out?
[1:46:08] How do you spend your leisure
[1:46:13] time? Praise be to God. Are you spending
[1:46:17] your last time reading the
[1:46:20] word or you spend it playing with
[1:46:24] girls? Do you spend your time
[1:46:28] praying or you spend it playing cards?
[1:46:34] Praise be to
[1:46:37] God. When you look at your life
[1:46:40] today and you compare with this uh you
[1:46:43] compare with with Esau and
[1:46:46] Jacob and you connect the mind of
[1:46:50] God, what do you think God is saying
[1:46:52] about
[1:46:55] you? Praise be to
[1:46:59] God. Hallelujah.
[1:47:01] Do you know that we living in the end
[1:47:04] time? So that Jesus is coming
[1:47:07] soon. He's coming for the bride. Are you
[1:47:11] the bride of
[1:47:12] Christ? What are you doing for your
[1:47:15] groom? Hallelujah. Do
[1:47:20] something. Because there is a voice
[1:47:22] coming. The voice of
[1:47:25] resurrection. Where will you be?
[1:47:32] Hallelujah.
[1:47:35] We must do something.
[1:47:39] God's protection upon us is not for
[1:47:43] granted but is for his
[1:47:46] purpose. That purpose is not for you to
[1:47:49] boycott
[1:47:51] services to do your own things to mind
[1:47:54] on your own
[1:47:55] business. Hallelujah. God has a
[1:47:59] business. Amen. And God minds about his
[1:48:03] business. And he want his children to
[1:48:05] mind about his
[1:48:09] business, not your business. There is
[1:48:12] time for your
[1:48:13] business. There's time for God's
[1:48:16] business. Blessed be the name of the
[1:48:19] Lord. Amen.
[1:48:24] But saying the message, who do you say
[1:48:27] this
[1:48:29] is? If you ever was or ever will be in
[1:48:36] heaven, you was in heaven to start
[1:48:42] with. Do you believe
[1:48:45] that? Yes. Part of God. You are part of
[1:48:48] God.
[1:48:50] You were his thoughts.
[1:48:52] He knew your name. Talk about your name,
[1:48:56] brother. God knows your
[1:48:59] name. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:49:02] God knows my
[1:49:04] name. God knows my
[1:49:06] address. He knows my trust
[1:49:10] state. Amen.
[1:49:13] The president of Uganda
[1:49:16] knows you as a
[1:49:18] citizen through you boss.
[1:49:21] They just tell him.
[1:49:24] In fact, he does not even know your
[1:49:27] name. He knows the name of his
[1:49:30] grandchildren and his
[1:49:33] sons. And I doubt whether even he knows
[1:49:35] all the names of his sons and daughters.
[1:49:39] He knows the name of some of his other
[1:49:41] and
[1:49:44] ministers. Praise be to God.
[1:49:51] Amen. But God knows our
[1:49:54] names. Each one of
[1:49:56] us. He knows your likes and
[1:50:00] dislikes. He knows your
[1:50:02] appetite. He knows your footstep.
[1:50:08] He knows your plans.
[1:50:12] Yes sir. He knew the blood of Jacob
[1:50:15] before he was
[1:50:17] born that boy loved he
[1:50:20] loved he loved
[1:50:26] inheritance. Praise be to God. And he
[1:50:29] looked at
[1:50:32] lousy who loved his stomach more than
[1:50:38] he praise be to
[1:50:41] God. Amen. And as they were
[1:50:46] growing, Jacob learned Esau's
[1:50:54] weakness. Praise be to God.
[1:50:57] Hallelujah.
[1:50:59] How did he know?
[1:51:01] Maybe every time when the food is
[1:51:04] brought in the
[1:51:07] dining is
[1:51:09] restless. When the mother is
[1:51:12] giving, praise be to God. Even in self
[1:51:16] service, he will even forget that the
[1:51:18] father his father has not served
[1:51:23] himself. And Jacob say,
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:29] "Oh, and they are believers like
[1:51:35] that. They can even sell their birthight
[1:51:37] because of
[1:51:42] food. They can sell their birth because
[1:51:45] of
[1:51:48] money. Praise be to God." They say, "I
[1:51:52] will do it and come and repent.
[1:51:55] your
[1:52:01] brother. Praise be to
[1:52:05] God. Doesn't
[1:52:07] care. After all, the birthight is mine
[1:52:11] according to the law. So, I will just
[1:52:14] tell him. Let me
[1:52:17] eat. Praise be to God. Jacob was smart.
[1:52:24] One day the brother was so hungry.
[1:52:30] Praise be to God.
[1:52:34] You know when you're about to get your
[1:52:37] victory. You will always
[1:52:40] know. Yes, you will see
[1:52:44] signs. Praise be to God.
[1:52:54] Praise be to
[1:52:57] God. Everybody who's giving you money
[1:53:01] 50,000 they give you in millions. Praise
[1:53:05] be to God.
[1:53:06] So that
[1:53:10] day the young man went and fried the
[1:53:13] thing, spiced
[1:53:18] the do you know that when you
[1:53:23] smell that that they call it what?
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:36] You smell the the the aroma aroma. Yes.
[1:53:41] Even the hunger increases increases. And
[1:53:45] maybe the man who was walking now even
[1:53:47] the knees started to
[1:53:49] break. Then he kept his
[1:53:51] brother. I'm
[1:53:55] dying. Are you
[1:53:57] sure? You first have a look.
[1:54:06] Ask
[1:54:07] whatever. Are you sure? I want your
[1:54:10] birthight.
[1:54:12] Birthright. I thought you going even to
[1:54:14] ask for my cow
[1:54:17] name. What is this
[1:54:19] birthight? Sincerely
[1:54:22] speaking, what is this birthight? You
[1:54:25] can even save me from
[1:54:28] hunger. Are you sure my brother?
[1:54:32] You know what you're talking about. I I
[1:54:34] believe he also pretended as if he does
[1:54:36] not want
[1:54:38] it. But my portage
[1:54:43] also but anyway you can have it.
[1:54:48] But before I have
[1:54:50] it first swear, my young brother, I
[1:54:54] swear in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:54:59] Christ from today and
[1:55:01] forth giving you my
[1:55:03] birthright. Hallelujah. Amen. Receive
[1:55:06] it. He say amen.
[1:55:09] And maybe when he said amen.
[1:55:13] Hallelujah. Amen. Something changed in
[1:55:16] his life.
[1:55:18] Brethren, the word
[1:55:21] speaks and the word
[1:55:24] creates spoken word is the original
[1:55:27] seed. Hallelujah. Esau's word was
[1:55:32] anointed because that was the right
[1:55:36] time to shift the birthight to
[1:55:39] Jacob. And I believe when he spoke and
[1:55:43] Jacob
[1:55:44] received something happened.
[1:55:47] like Mary when received the word of the
[1:55:51] angel and he said be unto me according
[1:55:54] to your word something happened in the
[1:55:58] womb of Mary.
[1:56:01] Hallelujah. And maybe Esa also felt like
[1:56:04] the anointing leaving
[1:56:09] him. Praise be to God. And you know God
[1:56:13] is so interesting.
[1:56:16] I
[1:56:17] believe few days after that
[1:56:21] time they started addressing Jacob in
[1:56:24] kind of a special
[1:56:29] way. Yes
[1:56:31] sir. When Jacob when David was
[1:56:35] anointed he never remained the same.
[1:56:39] Things started to change. It was
[1:56:42] gradually but the change was taking
[1:56:45] place. Hallelujah. Because anointing
[1:56:48] breaks the
[1:56:49] yoke. The moment David was
[1:56:52] anointed. Amen. The yoke started to
[1:56:58] break. Hallelujah.
[1:57:02] Amen. And maybe God
[1:57:06] say did I did I say that this guy will
[1:57:11] you
[1:57:13] see that's why
[1:57:16] sometimes when you advised by our
[1:57:20] pastor and they tell you that under no
[1:57:25] circumstance to the believer
[1:57:28] manelver say but pastor she is so
[1:57:31] beautiful
[1:57:33] wash
[1:57:37] out but when I look in
[1:57:42] church the other thing oh my good
[1:57:48] lord she's beautiful tube not even
[1:57:54] square forgetting the devil has spiced
[1:57:58] it the devil has spiced the portage
[1:58:05] He wanted to sell your bathroom.
[1:58:12] Praise be to
[1:58:15] God. You know when the devil blindfolds
[1:58:25] somebody, even you use the donkey to
[1:58:28] speak to you.
[1:58:32] You will go and start proposing to an
[1:58:37] unbeliever and she will tell you but I
[1:58:41] thought you are born
[1:58:44] again. And then said you
[1:58:47] know we
[1:58:49] human shame on
[1:58:52] you if you are
[1:58:54] there. I have had
[1:58:58] that where a brother went and going to
[1:59:01] see an
[1:59:05] unbeliever. See even born
[1:59:11] again, you are
[1:59:13] marked. And if you have a
[1:59:16] purpose and you know why you are
[1:59:19] here, you will run for your
[1:59:22] life. Come before at the altar. and
[1:59:25] repent. Say, "God, I'm sorry because
[1:59:29] your grace have found me."
[1:59:32] Yes,
[1:59:36] sir. Psalms and Philistians are on
[1:59:40] you. He comes then and tear those
[1:59:45] roads not knowing
[1:59:48] the devil is looking for. He's on his
[1:59:50] way.
[1:59:53] You know the devil
[1:59:56] those those
[1:59:57] devil's
[2:00:02] daughters they are also under
[2:00:07] anointing. She will just whisper a
[2:00:11] words and you will get a
[2:00:17] stroke. Maybe God is speaking. That is
[2:00:20] the devil's
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:25] anointing. Run for your life because you
[2:00:28] have a
[2:00:30] purpose and there are many things
[2:00:32] fighting against
[2:00:34] that. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:00:37] And don't forget this. God is watching
[2:00:41] you. What are you going to choose? must
[2:00:45] remember my
[2:00:47] brethren that we cannot be tempted
[2:00:49] beyond our
[2:00:53] face. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I
[2:00:57] don't care how spies that the devil has
[2:01:00] sp that
[2:01:03] Jezebel. Even if that Jezebel comes to
[2:01:06] you naked,
[2:01:09] you will escape still.
[2:01:12] Joseph was in Porta's house.
[2:01:16] He was serving
[2:01:17] there and the woman and first
[2:01:21] woman started lusting after
[2:01:25] Joseph.
[2:01:28] Joseph never said now the opportunity
[2:01:31] has shown up. The Bible only tells
[2:01:35] us where that incident
[2:01:40] happened. But if you read between the
[2:01:45] line, Joseph might have resisted
[2:01:48] trillion
[2:01:54] temptations. I remember one time I was
[2:01:56] working
[2:01:57] somewhere after spending the whole night
[2:02:00] in
[2:02:01] [Music]
[2:02:02] prayer. Praise be to God. In the morning
[2:02:07] when I came out of my
[2:02:09] room and I was going to the
[2:02:12] washroom, the washroom was out
[2:02:15] [Music]
[2:02:17] and there was a lady who was from
[2:02:30] showering when she saw me going toward
[2:02:33] the direction she was coming from.
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:37] And she just dropped her
[2:02:40] towel. I told her, "You do it next time.
[2:02:43] I will fire you from
[2:02:45] here." Because I was their
[2:02:49] boss. What am I trying to do? But
[2:02:53] wife might have done
[2:02:56] everything until that was the last
[2:02:59] trial.
[2:03:03] Maybe cut walking before Joseph. Joseph
[2:03:05] are you not
[2:03:09] see putting on dresses and comes
[2:03:15] and when Joseph sees some may be
[2:03:19] coming Joseph goes
[2:03:22] another and was
[2:03:24] hurting brethren. I know. I know how it
[2:03:29] is. A woman to tell you that she loves
[2:03:33] you and you turn her down.
[2:03:40] One day I was in senior
[2:03:43] six and there was a girl, she was my
[2:03:49] classmate and uh we were kind of not
[2:03:52] that close
[2:03:54] friend but we were sitting on the same
[2:03:59] desk and when I was in my high
[2:04:03] school I used to move with my everyday
[2:04:05] used to carry a message
[2:04:08] book every time. At least I remember for
[2:04:11] all the years I was I was at
[2:04:13] school, every day I read a
[2:04:19] message. Praise be to God. And then I
[2:04:22] did know that the girl was lusting after
[2:04:31] me. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:04:37] And then time came for
[2:04:41] preps. The dressing God started to
[2:04:44] change. And when she finally speaking to
[2:04:47] another
[2:04:48] [Music]
[2:04:49] girl and that was trouble, then I
[2:04:53] smelled
[2:04:55] her
[2:04:57] said one
[2:05:00] day. I think she gathered courage like
[2:05:03] for two months.
[2:05:05] [Music]
[2:05:07] And she came and told me, "Do you know
[2:05:10] that I love you? It was my first time in
[2:05:20] life. I I became
[2:05:26] confused because when I was
[2:05:28] growing, I used to fear ladies and girls
[2:05:31] so much.
[2:05:33] I was so
[2:05:35] shy. But at least I knew my
[2:05:40] stand. So when she told me
[2:05:44] that, I said
[2:05:47] impossible because community where we
[2:05:49] grew up
[2:05:50] from that that person is considered as a
[2:05:54] prostitute. How do you tell a man that
[2:05:56] you
[2:06:00] love? I told her
[2:06:03] sister. He said, "I'm not your
[2:06:09] sister." Praise be to God. All along
[2:06:12] that's how I've been seeing
[2:06:16] you sayhuh. She told me for me they
[2:06:19] don't reject me. Go and think about
[2:06:24] it. I told I don't need to think about
[2:06:29] this. I have told you
[2:06:32] I'm a
[2:06:35] Christian. I'm also
[2:06:40] Catholic. And the way that thing that
[2:06:44] girls, the way the thing hurted her,
[2:06:48] she was hurt to the extent that she
[2:06:50] changed the
[2:06:54] school. And after her senior
[2:06:58] six, when she came back, she looked for
[2:07:01] my
[2:07:03] number because her cousin was my
[2:07:07] friend and still she called.
[2:07:12] My
[2:07:16] brethren, I never looked at that as an
[2:07:22] opportunity and that was not
[2:07:26] enough. There were other two
[2:07:28] girls near our
[2:07:32] neighborhood. But one day, it was a
[2:07:35] Saturday, God sent a pastor from Cases.
[2:07:40] called Pastor Easter.
[2:07:42] Praise be to God. He preached on Sunday
[2:07:45] and these are the words he told me. He
[2:07:48] told my brother, "Be careful. The devil
[2:07:52] is after
[2:07:54] you." And I said, "How did he
[2:07:57] know?" But because there's a purpose in
[2:08:00] my
[2:08:02] life, God protected me. I never messed
[2:08:07] up. Amen. all my years of
[2:08:12] school up to
[2:08:15] today and I trust by the grace of God I
[2:08:20] will never mess
[2:08:22] up. Temptations are
[2:08:25] there, women are there, girls are there
[2:08:28] and
[2:08:30] ladies. Amen. But the grace of God will
[2:08:34] hold
[2:08:35] me because I have a
[2:08:38] purpose. Amen. Praise be to
[2:08:44] God. Wife became
[2:08:47] annoyed. Tell the
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:52] guys Joseph had a purpose.
[2:08:56] And you have a purpose.
[2:09:00] The reason you are slothful
[2:09:02] sometimes is because you don't know your
[2:09:06] purpose. But brother, you have a
[2:09:09] purpose. It cannot be
[2:09:11] defeated. Never, never, never, it cannot
[2:09:15] be defeated. Even when you are going
[2:09:18] through the fire, it will never be
[2:09:20] defeated.
[2:09:23] Hallelujah. Praise be to God.
[2:09:26] It is the word keeping us.
[2:09:31] Let us cling to the
[2:09:33] world. Let us be glory. Let us be at
[2:09:36] afraid of the
[2:09:37] cross looking unto Jesus. Forgetting
[2:09:41] about our yesterday where we have failed
[2:09:44] yesterday, where you failed this
[2:09:46] morning. But I'm the voice right now.
[2:09:50] The voice of God telling you, you have a
[2:09:52] purpose in your
[2:09:54] life. Stay focused.
[2:09:58] be to God.
[2:10:01] Amen.
[2:10:07] Praise the Lord.
[2:10:16] There is so many entertaining things of
[2:10:19] our day.
[2:10:22] There is so much to entice people to to
[2:10:25] to what they would call
[2:10:28] [Music]
[2:10:30] pleasure. And it is for all people and
[2:10:33] all
[2:10:36] ages. But to you have a
[2:10:38] purpose, you cannot be
[2:10:42] shaken. Praise be to God. Jesus had a
[2:10:47] purpose. He knew why he was on earth. He
[2:10:50] knew his mission. He knew the mission
[2:10:52] was not for him. Even when the devil
[2:10:54] told him to turn water into to turn a
[2:10:57] stone into bread,
[2:10:59] Jesus never paid the
[2:11:01] devil because there was a purpose and it
[2:11:05] must be
[2:11:08] accomplished. Blessed be the
[2:11:12] name. I'm just I'm ending with this
[2:11:14] scripture.
[2:11:19] Let's read in
[2:11:27] uh in Romans chapter
[2:11:33] 8 vers 20. We shall begin from
[2:11:37] 28. We start from 27. And he that
[2:11:42] searchth the heart knoweth what is the
[2:11:44] mind of the spirit because he maketh
[2:11:47] intercession for the saint according to
[2:11:51] the will of God. And we know that all
[2:11:53] things work together for good to them
[2:11:56] that love God.
[2:11:59] To them who are the called according to
[2:12:01] his purpose.
[2:12:08] [Music]
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:26] Amen. According to his
[2:12:31] purpose. God's purpose is your purpose.
[2:12:36] And the Bible say all things work
[2:12:38] together
[2:12:40] for
[2:12:45] whe they work for our
[2:12:52] good for whom he did for no he also
[2:12:57] predestinate to be conformed to the
[2:13:00] image of his son that he might be the
[2:13:04] firstborn among his many
[2:13:07] [Music]
[2:13:14] brethren. And more and moreover whom he
[2:13:17] did predestinate them, he also
[2:13:23] called. And whom he called them, he also
[2:13:26] justified.
[2:13:31] justified them. He also
[2:13:36] glorified. What shall we say
[2:13:40] then to these things? If God be for us,
[2:13:44] who can be against
[2:13:47] us? Who can be against
[2:13:50] you? Even death can't be against you. No
[2:13:54] trouble can be against you. No challenge
[2:13:56] can be against you. No problem can be
[2:13:59] against you.
[2:14:03] Amen. If God be for me, who can put me
[2:14:08] down? Which problem can put me down?
[2:14:12] Hallelujah. Amen. I will go through the
[2:14:15] storm. But the storm will not tear me
[2:14:18] down because I am an eagle. I am
[2:14:22] designed to face the
[2:14:24] storm. And it is said it is said in the
[2:14:29] eyes of the storm. That's where the
[2:14:32] eagle
[2:14:34] face when the storm is coming
[2:14:37] westward. The ego will not go
[2:14:39] eastward. The eagle will go
[2:14:43] northwestward. Blessed be the name of
[2:14:46] the Lord. Because the ego knows after
[2:14:49] gone through the
[2:14:51] storm. Hallelujah. There is company
[2:14:54] behind the
[2:14:57] storm. Don't run away from your
[2:15:00] storm. Yes, even I have my
[2:15:04] storms. But every single day, every
[2:15:07] single moment I am facing my storm and
[2:15:11] I'm going through one by one. I pass
[2:15:14] through
[2:15:15] to I go through Katrina and I go.
[2:15:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Whatever comes my way
[2:15:23] My brother, my sister, if God be for us,
[2:15:27] who can be against us.
[2:15:31] Amen. I know the plan I have
[2:15:35] toward. Not what you are seeing right
[2:15:39] now. That's not what God has
[2:15:43] toward. But God is promising you in your
[2:15:47] weakness, in your trial, in your
[2:15:51] failure. in your sinful situation.
[2:15:56] Amen.
[2:15:58] He will lead you to unex he will give
[2:16:01] unexpected
[2:16:03] yes and when you look
[2:16:06] back you will speak like summer of
[2:16:09] oil and
[2:16:13] say see how far the Lord has brought
[2:16:18] us sir do not
[2:16:22] panic don't be
[2:16:25] shaken the Lord is on our
[2:16:29] side. Praise be to God. I know he's on
[2:16:33] my
[2:16:34] side. The me you're looking at
[2:16:36] today is not what I'm going to be the
[2:16:39] next. What I'm going to be the next day
[2:16:42] is what God has prepared me to
[2:16:44] be. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:16:47] Because the Bible gives us a
[2:16:49] promise that we don't know what we shall
[2:16:52] be. But he gives us again assurance. One
[2:16:56] thing we know when he will
[2:16:59] appear let him appear even now and he
[2:17:03] will know what I'm going to
[2:17:05] be. I'm going to be
[2:17:07] spotless without wrinkle an overcomer.
[2:17:12] So he who
[2:17:13] overcome will sit with me on my father's
[2:17:18] throne. Do you know the kind of people
[2:17:20] are going to sit with Jesus on his
[2:17:22] father's throne?
[2:17:25] Look at me.
[2:17:31] Yes. Maybe brother not. You are just
[2:17:33] excited. I am
[2:17:38] not. Maybe I'm excited because I'm going
[2:17:41] to sit with
[2:17:43] him. You don't even look like overcomer.
[2:17:45] I
[2:17:47] am. Overcomers. They don't have three
[2:17:49] legs. They have two like mine.
[2:17:57] The Bible tells
[2:17:59] us
[2:18:01] Elijah, he was just an ordinary man
[2:18:04] like he just broke the world three and a
[2:18:08] half years no
[2:18:12] rain. You are joking.
[2:18:16] If God be for me, if he if he be for
[2:18:20] Elijah, he spoke to the king
[2:18:23] jokingly and told him king, it will not
[2:18:27] rain even two will not fall for three
[2:18:30] and a half years and he locked heaven.
[2:18:33] And he put the key in his pocket and
[2:18:36] went to the
[2:18:39] cave. The situation affected Elijah.
[2:18:45] Oh, the raven was
[2:18:47] prepared to take care of the man of
[2:18:50] God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. And Elijah
[2:18:54] had
[2:18:55] revival. It was not
[2:18:57] raining. They looked for Elijah. He was
[2:19:00] nowhere to be seen. Hallelujah. The man
[2:19:04] had gone
[2:19:07] dark. Hallelujah. He had revival with
[2:19:11] the
[2:19:12] angels. That was not ordinary
[2:19:14] [Applause]
[2:19:16] leaven. A raven cannot even carry this
[2:19:19] live of this
[2:19:21] size. But God has a special
[2:19:24] raven. Hallelujah. And Jesus Christ is
[2:19:27] the same
[2:19:28] yesterday forever. Amen. There is a
[2:19:32] special ra for
[2:19:34] you. Don't you worry. Stay with the
[2:19:37] word. Hallelujah. Amen. God will take
[2:19:40] care of you. He will take care of us.
[2:19:45] Hallelujah. Amen. He said, "I will
[2:19:48] restore whatever is eaten by conqueror,
[2:19:51] by
[2:19:52] caterpillar, by worms, by locals." We
[2:19:56] are living the time of
[2:19:59] restoration. Praise be to God. The rean
[2:20:02] fed the man of
[2:20:05] God and the man was now when he saw the
[2:20:09] brook dried up
[2:20:12] And God told him, "Uhuh, move
[2:20:16] on. I still have, brethren, Elijah had
[2:20:21] an expected
[2:20:23] end when the brook dried
[2:20:26] up." God took him to the
[2:20:31] wind. Praise the Lord. Let God be for
[2:20:35] you. your
[2:20:43] enemies. Praise be to
[2:20:45] God. What I heard one sister was giving
[2:20:48] a
[2:20:49] testimony where she work where she
[2:20:51] works. Everybody says her, you mess with
[2:20:54] that one, you in
[2:20:56] problem. God, let God be for
[2:21:00] you. Your enemies will be in
[2:21:03] trouble. May God, May the Lord bless
[2:21:05] you.
[2:21:06] Shall we rise on our feet
[2:21:11] as the deacon is bringing uh the as
[2:21:14] we're going to give in our offerings and
[2:21:17] time. Precious father in the name of
[2:21:19] Jesus. Lord we thank you for this
[2:21:22] evening. We thank for the word you have
[2:21:24] given us. I trust that God you have
[2:21:26] encouraged
[2:21:28] us. We are the people
[2:21:30] Lord of the book. We are the last race
[2:21:34] father, the last race
[2:21:37] runner. We are that invisible armor you
[2:21:39] spoke
[2:21:41] of. And father, we know that we are
[2:21:45] and we believe we are that invisible
[2:21:47] armor. Lord, even tonight you have
[2:21:50] spoken. It's our desire. We open our
[2:21:54] understanding to know who we
[2:21:58] are. Father, we bless your name. May the
[2:22:02] Holy Spirit take this
[2:22:03] word and awaken it in our soul. May you
[2:22:07] help us not to lose the
[2:22:09] track to stay
[2:22:11] focused. We know that we have a
[2:22:14] purpose and that purpose will come to
[2:22:18] pass. Receive the glory Lord Jesus in
[2:22:21] the most precious name of the Lord.
[2:22:26] Father, we pray oh
[2:22:29] God for the offerings and
[2:22:31] tithes as we be even as we be leaving
[2:22:34] here going back to our homes. We pray
[2:22:36] that Jehovah God you go with each one of
[2:22:39] us. May this word keep on echoing in our
[2:22:44] hearts. Blind us from the things of the
[2:22:47] world. Capture our mind oh
[2:22:49] God each day. Prepare our heart for your
[2:22:53] visitation. May he open our eyes to see
[2:22:56] the things
[2:22:57] above where Christ lived from the father
[2:23:00] where Christ our father in the right
[2:23:02] hand of
[2:23:05] God. We pray for our pastor this
[2:23:09] evening. We send the word of healing
[2:23:11] upon his
[2:23:13] life victory in the name of
[2:23:15] Jesus. May release the anointing upon
[2:23:18] him Lord and may every yoke
[2:23:21] break. Let every fetus
[2:23:25] Lord be loosed in the name of Jesus
[2:23:28] Christ. May the angel may your angel
[2:23:31] minister unto us.
[2:23:34] Bless each one of us and as father we

[2:23:56] Lord Jesus Christ.
