Uganda and many others those that will watch this service after many days foreign and this is just I was just trying to do a sample to see how it would be we did not make any prior announcements and really most of you uh youth in this church okay they can maybe can help us the statutory is that so different uh okay so you didn't count yourself foreign foreign [Music] uh I'm sure we will have more

of course we did not announce the meeting early enough so they could not allow him because they had a supervision at his place of work and I know there are others in that category so I was just trying to do a sample to see how it would be this is our first youth meeting amen amen and I know there will be many more that will follow I will be bringing in guest speakers to speak to you again I have in mind about two brothers in Nairobi who have a real good Ministry
