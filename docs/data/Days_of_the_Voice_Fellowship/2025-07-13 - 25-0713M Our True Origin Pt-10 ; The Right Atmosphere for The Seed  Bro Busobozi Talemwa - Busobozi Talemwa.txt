[Music] Lord, I can't satisfy those. But you are the cohort that satisfies everything. May you come Lord and minister to us through your word this week and may our needs be met. Grant I pray bless us now as we go in your word as we open the pages of your word. Inspire us Lord, what we shall say and how your people will receive. I just ask your leadership, &gt;&gt; your presence in Jesus mighty name. Amen. Amen. Amen. I have some announcements this morning. But I'm just going to request you we just go straight to the word first and then we'll come back with the announcements. I think this will help you. We are going in the book of Luke chapter 8 vers um we're going to read from 8 to 15. [Music] So I'm going to read first and uh then my brother will read next. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city, he spake he spake by a parable. A ser went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it was trodden down, and the folds of the air devoured it. And some fell upon a rock. And as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away because it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns. and the thorn sprung up with it and choked it. And others fell on good ground and sprung up and bear fruit 100fold. And when he had these things, he cried. And when he said, sorry, these things he cried, he that has ears to hear to hear, let him hear. And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? And he said, "Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but unto others in parables, that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand." Now the parable is this, the seed is the word of God. Those by the wayside are they that hear. Then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. They on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy, and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. And that which fell among thorns, are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring forth no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground are they which in unhornness and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. Amen. Brother, maybe you want to read um we are in the book of Luke chapter 8 begin from vers 4 and read all the way forchech. [Music] [Music] forget [Music] forchech. [Music] [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. May God bless your church. You may be seated. Thank you musicians. God bless you. Brother Peter, nice to see you. Pray for brother Langa's voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't work, I'll call brother Peter to come and interpret today. Praise the name of the Lord. Well, I just wanted to say that I have an announcement, a major announcement today. regarding um our land um uh fund and all that and uh so you don't want to miss it. But usually um when there's an a good atmosphere like this, you just want to straight away go to the word any other business can come come out because there are some people maybe even I had some people visiting with us for the maybe their first time. They have not come to hear our business. They have come to hear the word. So I think we should give the word priority. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So um and then after the um right after the word we will get into those things and uh I'm sure that it's going to excite your heart. Um so this morning I'm speaking on um we're still on our series of our true origin. I'm happy to see you brother Joshua. It's &gt;&gt; been a while. Oh brother Neville. &gt;&gt; Wow. God bless you brother. You know, it's it's always good to see you in church. Amen. Whenever you you don't come to church, your pastor feels bad. And if your pastor feels bad, it means your God feels bad. So your pastor is not your God, but is your shepherd. He represents Christ. And so we are going to um speak on today. Brother Isaac, I don't know whether you'll call it overcoming power in the seed part three or you'll call it the right atmosphere. The right atmosphere, [Music] but really today I'm speaking on the right atmosphere for the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to begin with a few things maybe that I've uh talked about here. And if you missed the if you miss any part of this series and maybe you are not able to come to church, please I encourage you to always go back and listen. So this morning I'm I'm speaking on we have been talking much about the seed and maybe today we can also first of all read John chapter 17. on on verses 10 it says, "And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. And I am now and I am I'm now and now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. And I come to thee, holy father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one even as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Those that thou gavest me, I have kept and none of them is lost, but the son of pedition that the scripture might be fulfilled. I spoke on that extensively on Wednesday. Um, excuse me, brother Julius. I know you came with your blood brother. Is he here? Where is he? Is he the one next to you? God bless you, sir. You're welcome. God bless you, sir. Amen. feel feel at church and uh just open your heart and now you see in this scripture Jesus is speaking of his disciples his 12 disciples are you following me this series are really much of study and so it is good you be alert Even if you go out for a minute, you come back, you may miss the whole thing. So stay in one place and in your mind. So here we notice that um Jesus is speaking about his 12 disciples and this is what he was he was speaking of them as he was praying. He says, "All mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. I come to thee, holy father, keep through thy own name those whom you have given me that they may be one." Christ loves his to be united. Amen. Is it's very important for the church to be united. The church of Jesus Christ to be united. It's just like your body. If your body is disintegrated, you imagine if you are coming here on Sunday morning and you look for your legs and you can't find them or you look for your hands and you can't find them and you're like legs, where are you? Hands, where are you? Eyes, where are you? You understand? You would be a disintegrated body. But we notice Jesus also has a body. God has a body on earth. He's no longer here on earth, but he has a body on earth. And and this body is the body of believers. And he wants that body to be united. If we are united, there is no force can defeat us. If the body is united, there is no power can destroy us. Because God said through Jesus Christ that even all the gates of hell shall not prevail against that body of Christ against the church. But remember, we've been talking about the true church and the false church. We've been talking about the true vine and the false vine. You know, the the true vine and the the false vine are both in the same But but you see he said at the time of the harvest we are going to be able to separate the false from the from the truth. And it is so close that if it were possible it will receive the elect. But in that scripture when he says if it were possible it means it is impossible to deceive the hect. So I am sure that the elect cannot be deceived. And that's why even Jesus while he was praying he said I have I have kept them in thy name those that are in Christ are kept in the name of Christ. The name of God is Jesus Christ. And the Bible says those that have been baptized into Christ I have put on Christ. I have kept them in thy name. That those that thou gave me I have kept and none of them is lost. But you remember he called 12 but he says none of them is lost. So does he mean even Judas was not lost? No. is not talking about Judas here because Judas was not among those that cannot be deceived. Judas did not have the seed of God in him. Judas had a serpent seed in him. There are people on the world today who have a seed of the sermon. &gt;&gt; Let me put it this way. Who are the seed of the ser? &gt;&gt; They can never be saved. &gt;&gt; That's one of the teachings that we differentiate with all the other denominations. [Music] Some denominations teach all will be saved. And some one denomination that I know of. Even if you have an uncle and he died, he was never baptized. They will tell you to baptize on his behalf because they believe everyone is to be saved. But that's not true. The Bible in the book of first John says there are children of God and there are children of the devil is in the Bible. So we have two different vines, two different seeds in the same church but they only manifest properly in the end time. All right. What makes them who they are? It is not what they do or what they don't do. Are you hearing me now? Be very alert this morning. If you are not careful, you can dismiss a child of God and call them serpentes because they have done something wrong. And if you're not careful, you're going to summarize everything and put it under legalism. And you will say the seed of God cannot do this, cannot do this, cannot do that. So it means if someone does something wrong one or two or three times it means there are but who among you here can stand and say since they believed the message since they came to Christ has never done anything wrong. All of you are guilty. You have done things wrong. But I'm here to tell you whether you what you have done that is wrong does not testify to who you are. What you have done that is right does not make you who you are not. You cannot say because I dress well, I don't drink, I've never lied, I've never done any moral thing. Therefore, I'm a seed of God. No, what you do that is good in your own self is not necessarily recognized by God. because he even says the works of your own righteousness are as filthy rags before God. [Music] So when God looks at the good things that you do, he sees you as a mad person because it is only a mad person that wears filthy rugs. So does it mean you should not do good things? You should not live the right kind of life. No, that's not what is meaning. He's saying I am not looking at what you are doing. I am not looking at what you have not done right or wrong. But I am looking at the seed that is within you. That is what separates you from everything else. And they that have the seed of God in their life, there are they that will overcome the world. This is the victory that overcomes the world. We can preach the word. We can shout the word. We can talk the word. It cannot make you a seed. &gt;&gt; The word will only bring out who you are. So both will do wrong. But there's something that differentiates them is the nature of the seed. in them. Now, those that have the nature of the seed of God, they don't just become, they were in the mind of God before they were born. You understand what I'm saying? That's why it's not even water baptism that saves you. If it was the thief on the cross would never get it. How many are following me? You really need to follow me closely. It's not water baptism that makes you the elect. Because if it was, some who were never baptized in water like the thief on the cross would never get it, but he got it. Why? Because he had a seed of God in him. So how do you know he that has the seed? The one that has the seed, will always believe the word, will always receive the word, he will be a good ground. He will have a good atmosphere, the right atmosphere for the word to flourish out of their life. and he will be like a river of water that is gushing out of him. So we see that Jesus here is praying and he says none of them none of them is lost. Meaning the ones you have given me none of them is lost. But then he says, "But the son of pedition was he one of the 12 years." Who? Judas. And I got on Wednesday I gave you an example. And I said Judas did wrong, but also Peter did wrong. Which was a better sin? Which was the worst? [Music] Both of them were sinners as far as what they did was concerned. But that did not define who they were. Are you following me? But here when Judah sinned, he did not have a heart that convicted him to walk away from his sin. He did not have the mind to believe in the saving blood of Jesus. He did not understand the power of grace. He could not listen follow me here. He could not forgive himself. &gt;&gt; He condemned himself. more than God. And he hanged himself and went to hell. But Peter, he did the same thing. But what happened? He was convicted. He felt so sorry that he had done what he had done. He was not proud of it. He was not happy about it. His heart condemned him. Yes. And condemnation translated into conviction. Amen. And then he realized there is nothing good himself that can save him that can redeem him. So he turned to the wall. He cried to the glory of God because he knew his help cometh from the Lord. Creator of heaven and earth, the seed of God will always will always will always will always turn to God because we know we know that we know we cannot redeem ourselves. We cannot save ourselves. We cannot help ourselves, we are helpless without God. And when we come and turn to him and cry out to him, then he says, "Oh my son, what is it? What have done? What did you do? I don't see it." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You remember the bleach of the blood? I don't see it. Cuz the moment you confess your sin, the Bible says if we say we have no sin, we make God a liar because we have all sinned. If we are we confess our sin, he is righteous. He is just to forgive us of all our sins. He there's a bleach of the blood will wash it away. But even the best of the demons cannot be able to find it again. When a child of God has sinned and has confessed his sin. That sin goes under the blood and is divorced from him. God never sees it again. And when he comes to accuse you before God, God says, "I can't see anything they have done. I can't see anything they have done. They are perfect. They are right. They are holy. They have no blemish. Why? Because they that are in Christ are a new creation. Old things have passed away. All things behind [Music] of them is lost. &gt;&gt; If you are a seed of God, you can never be lost. Tell your neighbor, it doesn't matter who they are, if they are the seed of God, they'll never be lost. But if they are not, even if you tell them, it doesn't change anything. So tell them you will never be lost. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When if the seed of God when they hear that the seed in them is somehow quickened. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the son of petition H let me record something that I I read already. We further learned this is from the Ladian church that these two vines would grow side by side until the end of the age. When both would come to maturity and both would be havevested, the first vine would not overcome and destroy the true vine. The first vine has a mission. Follow me here now. The mission of the first vine is to destroy the true vine. But here he says the false vine can never overcome and can never destroy the true vine. But then neither would the true vine be able to bring the first vine into a saving relationship with Christ. Revelation is progressive. &gt;&gt; I'll confess. &gt;&gt; I used to think that as long as you preach the word to somebody, they will change. I used to think that but I was wrong. [Music] You can preach the word to the false vine. It can never change them. Matter of fact, it will make them worse. The more they hear the word, the more they realize who they are. Let me tell you church, the word shows or let me call it put it this way manifest your true origin. It doesn't matter who you are. The word removes the mystery, reveals the hidden things. Because the Bible say the word of God is powerful. Is powerful. It's powerful. He's like a two-edged sword. Soul and SP will design you. That's how powerful the word is. The word will show your joy. The word will reveal who you are. The word will show your true colors. The word will expose you. The word will manifest you. So if you are a false vine, you will become worse. If you're a true vine, you will become better and better, better, better and better. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The more of the word you enjoy, &gt;&gt; the more you will improve. Who are you? &gt;&gt; I am a true vine. [Music] But then here he says, "Neither a true vine cannot be able to bring the first vine into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ. So listen, bring your friends to church. You don't know who they are. Some of them may be true vine, but they hidden in those things. Are you following me? Bring them to church. We don't know who they are. That's why even on the pullpit, you preachers, quit quit telling people what to do. Quit being legalistic. Just give them the word. Whenever you give somebody the word, it doesn't matter how they are. It doesn't matter who they are. The word will reveal who they are. Amen. Bring them here wearing trousers. Bring them wearing trousers. We know women are not supposed to wear trousers according to the Bible. But they don't know. So bring them. Let them hear the word. Amen. I will never talk about it when they come. I will not. So don't fear to bring your friend because she's wearing a trouser. Some of you, you killed a seed before they even realize who they are. You can come, but don't wear a trouser. But I don't have anything else. I'm sorry. First to get money and buy a skirt. What? God forgive you. God forgive you for thinking laws can save everybody. Bring them the way they are. I can assure you in not so long a time when they hear the word you are hearing. They will realize who they are. Many of them will say, "Oh, I I don't need to wear them. There is a precious brother in Ethiopia &gt;&gt; called professor professor &gt;&gt; in the university. &gt;&gt; You know what happened? He came to a church and he loved this message. Another sister y brought him. So so he loved the word and he told me pastor I love this message so much and I showed who I am. I need to be baptized. So I baptized him in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. And then he told me, "Pastor, but I don't want to tell my wife about it now because I fear for my marriage. We may divorce because I know she can't receive this. It is very difficult." But I told him, "Brother, why do you say so?" And he said, "Oh, she loves makeup. Oh, she loves hearing. Oh, she loves wearing trousers. I said, don't you worry about it, brother. Bring her to church. Don't talk about it. And I said, brother, I promise you, I will not talk about it. Just bring her to church and see what God is going to do. We cannot know who she is. until she hears the word. But I tell you church, when she came to church, 1 2 3 4 5 6 months, within the first 3 months, she reduced her makeup. She started wearing trousers and sometimes she was not wearing. The next three months, trousers was completely gone. No one told her to stop. Makeup was completely gone. No one told her to stop. Within the end of the sixth month, she told me, "I want to be baptized." No one told her to do it. We just kept on preaching the word. Brother, I tell you this word has no power. &gt;&gt; But the power it has only will manifest who you truly are. It will show your true origin. If you came from God, the word will remind you you are not of this world. You came from above. You came from God. You don't need to live in sin. You don't need to live like that. &gt;&gt; You don't need to live like that. I won't tell you. I won't tell you. But the seed of God in you will be quickened. Oh, help me preach this church. The seed will be quickened. And you will be energized. And all of a sudden, you will say, "I don't need this anymore. I don't need this anymore. I don't need &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you believe this?" &gt;&gt; So, we cannot bring the false vine into a relationship. But we don't know who they are. So bring them unless give them the water and we'll find out. He continues to say, "We learned the most amazing truth that the Holy Spirit could and would would fall upon the unregenerated vine Christians and he will manifest powerfully in various signs and wonders. Even as Judas had a definite ministry in the Holy Ghost, he himself was pronounced to be a devil. Is that Sister Mary? Your chair is right here. There's a Please come over here. I love my amen corner to be on this side. Praise the name of the Lord. So follow me closely now. What does he say? He says that the Holy Spirit, not an evil spirit. The Holy Church, are you here today? The Holy &gt;&gt; will do what will fall upon the false vine. and manifest powerfully in various signs and wonders. Pastor, how come? Because it is possible for the false vine to be religious but not a Christian. Even Judas had a definite ministry. &gt;&gt; Judas cast out demons. Judas drove away powers of darkness. Yet he himself Jesus said, "I call 12 of you and one of you is a devil." Yet he did miracles, signs, and wonders. So the way we are able to know who is who is not by signs, miracles and wonders. If you are looking at that, you are looking in the wrong place, signs, miracles or wonders or nothing doesn't define who the person is. It is possible for someone to have a ministry of miracles, signs and wonders and preach a false doctrine. Balam was one of them. He had a powerful min prophetic ministry. He How many agree with me that he was hearing from God? &gt;&gt; He was the man was anointed truly. genuinely and his prophecies were accurate. But his teaching ministry was false. He led the people away from God. He told them to go in the parties of non-believers. He told them it was okay to dress the way they wanted. He told them it was okay to go to the unbeliever's parties. He told them it was not a big deal if they fornicated. He told them it was not really really bothering God. Grace covered for that. And these people ended up in those kind of patterns. And when God saw it, he destroyed them all. But they were misled by an anointed man with a false ministry. Never be destroyed or deceived by the anointing. Do not look at the anointing, brother. Look at the word. Test every ministry by the word. What are they teaching? Do they believe in one God? Do they believe in water baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. What do they believe about the ministry? What is the position of women and men in the ministry? This is how you test every ministry. They have to be true to the word. If they are not, walk away even from the anointing because it will mislead you. So you see church. Now harvest time. Yes, harvest time. The two vines that grew together and intertwined their branches are now being separated at harvest time. The fruits of those vines which were at such variance will be gathered into separate Ghanas. The two spirits will go to their separate destinations. Now, now in the end time, now it is time to heed the final call. that comes only to the witch bride. Am I having a witch bride here? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Come out of our my people. Amen. That ye be not partakers of our sins. But ye the wheat receive not her tears plagues plagues are coming. Plagues are coming. Tell your neighbor plagues are coming. Plagues are coming. The Bible says come out of that's why we don't have fellowship with them. Come out of that's why we don't even go to their churches. come out of our so we can join in the cast of churches with them. The voice of the end time message the end time messenger is crying out to the wy bride. Come out of her my people. Come out of her. Do not receive of her plagues. What is it? The great tribulation which is the sixth seal. It is coming is not my portion. The tribulation is not my portion but it is coming and some are preparing and waiting for it. It's not my portion. [Music] All elect of God be aware. Study closely. Be careful. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling. Rely upon God and be strong in his might. Your adversary. The devil is even now going about like a rolling lion seeking whom he will devour. Wash unto prayer. and be steady fast. This is the end time. Both the true and the false vine are coming into maturity. But before the wheat matures, those ripened tears must be bound for burning. How are they being bound? They are being bound in the an organization called World Council of Churches is a bundling for burning. If they are a member or a part of it, they will not receive they will they will not be persecuted. They receive the mark of the beast to mark that they abandoned together for burning. But what about the bride? She will not join them. Hallelujah. She will be prepared for the ch for the translation, for the change of our body, for the rapture. But right now the two spirits are at work in two vines. Come out from among the start to overcome. &gt;&gt; Start to overcome. Start to overcome and you may be considered praiseworthy for your Lord and you'll be fit &gt;&gt; to reign and rule with him. [Music] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now let me go into the learning the teaching for today for maybe 25 minutes or so. Listen, the the right atmosphere &gt;&gt; is what the seed needs to be able to mature. If you a seed of God, the last thing you should worry about is whether you will make it in the rapture or not. Are you following? The last thing you should be concerned about is whether sin will defeat you or not. You can't be defeated by sin. Hallelujah. You cannot. You cannot now. It doesn't matter what you think about it. Hear what I'm telling you. You may be saying, "Pastor, you're speaking like that because you do not know my life." You know what I go through in my mind, in my life, in my actions, in my in my this and that. Do you think God doesn't know it? Oh, you think it took him by surprise? Oh, pastor, what about my past? Well, none of us has a good past. If it was on the basis of the past, none of us would be saved. So friends, you have to look beyond all that. Do not put your mind always to your weakness to the extent that you will even fail to come to church. You let your problems and your weaknesses define you to an extent. You cannot do anything for the Lord. It's like the devil has put you in cups and you are a slave of the devil. But I want to tell you this morning, here is what you should do. Your problems, I call them insufficiencies. in encumbrances. Are you following those encumbrances, trouble, things that are heavy, you know, he heavy loading, your weaknesses, your fears, that is not even in the picture here. We are not even talking about it. It is so insignificant, so insignificant that if you are a sin, God doesn't even address you about it. No, no, no. He doesn't address you about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't address you about it. Why? He only speaks &gt;&gt; and he says, "I'm I'm coming back to take a church, a church without spot." Without wrinkle, without spot. How many here have no spot? Without wrinkle. What? Washing the blood of the lamb that is holy, sinless, justified. That's what God says. So do you mean God is blind? Can't you see that you brother someone is a so insignificant that he doesn't waste your time and his time talking about it because he knows this one thing. Whatever he has said will be whatever he has seen must happen because he is God. And that's why he said in every generation they are overcomer over. That's what he said. He took all your sins. He took all your problems. He took all your weaknesses &gt;&gt; and he put it under one word over. Hallelujah. What are you overcoming? &gt;&gt; You're overcoming your weakness, your problem, your trouble, your weakness, everything. I must overcome. Tell yourself, I must overcome. I am an overcomer. That's what God sees and that's what the devil hates for you to know. Praise the name of the Lord. But only the elect will not be deceived. The shark and the tears, the shark of the tears cannot be hair with a seat. Overcoming [Music] power is not in the word itself. But it is in the seed. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where is it? &gt;&gt; Where is it? Overcoming power is in the sea. &gt;&gt; Overcoming power is in the sea. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look around if your neighbors doors and tell them wake up. The devil doesn't want you to hear this. Overcoming power is where is in the seed. &gt;&gt; I feel like saying that a million times. overcoming power. Now, did you realize the word also is a seed? &gt;&gt; So, what seed am I talking about? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the seed which is already in you. Why? that those whom he forneew he predestined men. Listen to be conformed to the image of who? Of God. Now, now listen to this. He chose you when and where he chose you in him when &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. There was nothing to choose from because remember there was no pre-existence. So there was only God. And he says he chose you in him. So who are you? You are God. Hallelujah. What is the word? The word of God is God. In the beginning was the word and the word was God. The word was with God. The word was God. So now the word is a seed and you are a seed. How many now get it? [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when I say overcoming power is not in the word. I mean is not in the preaching of the word but truly overcoming power is in the word because the word is a seed and you are a seed. So when you hear the preaching of the word because you are a seed the seed in you is by the preaching of the word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And that's why what the bride rejoices over the bride amen is stimulated when they hear the preaching of the word. Why? Because it is showing who they are. It is reminding them where they come from. [Music] Amen. Only the seed can be quickened. The seed needs a certain atmosphere. to be quickened and to be able to come to maturity. You may be now I'm talking to seed. I don't have time for ser. If you are the seed of God, you may still be confused in this world and lose what you need to get and lose totally completely your identity because the atmosphere is wrong. [Music] But before I continue, I will say this, &gt;&gt; it is impossible for you to be lost. The reason is the reason is you were in him. And he says none of them is lost. So the devil can delay you, but he can't stop you. Oh mama. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel like preaching about the devil can delay you but he cannot stop you. The Bible say you were predestinated. That means God saw your end at the beginning. So your destiny is not lost. God knows your destiny. God knows how this will end. God knows how you will end up. Someone may say you will end up bad. No, no, no. If you are a seed of God, you can never end up back. Because God has predestinated. &gt;&gt; He knows where you will end up. Hallelujah. The devil can delay your he may stop you with discoveries. He will deny you with this. He may push you with that. But the devil has to understand you are a seed to begin. He cannot stop your destiny. My destiny is not lost. I know where I am going. like Jesus. I know where I came from and I know where you are going because I am in the image of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know the devil can bring some little demons and make you think you you are an immoral person. No, you are not an immoral person. He's delaying you with that. But he has to understand soon and very soon you shall see the king soon and very soon you will go where you are supposed to go. The devil can delay you with poverty because he knows when you're poor you can't study the word and you will be disturbed in your mind. But you know what? You know what? Even poverty cannot stop you. poverty is only a delaying tactic. So the devil might as well know &gt;&gt; in everything that comes to me to you. He better gives up is fighting a losing battle. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it may be your family the devil is using to delay. Yes. But let me tell you, my the devil used my mother for some time and I spent about a few several months feared, bleeding because she said, "I've disowned you." If you're going to believe that happens to this. So the devil thought the way I love my mother, he will make me stop. He will cut me off from the message. He delayed me for a few months, but he could not stop me. Tell your neighbor, the devil may delay you for a while. He cannot stop you. Hallelujah. Oh, we need to shout about this church. &gt;&gt; We need to rejoice about it. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So the seed cannot be stored. &gt;&gt; But you see, for the seed to mature, the seed needs a certain atmosphere to be able to mature. Amen. And there are three specific things that any seed need to be able to come to maturity. Number one, the seed needs good ground soil, fertile soil. Are you following me? The seed needs water, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Without water, it cannot grow. &gt;&gt; Even if it is seed, right? The seed needs sunlight. Without a sunlight, even if you make all the electricity light, it will not help the seed. It needs natural sunlight [Music] and we will talk about each of these. &gt;&gt; Not today. But for tonight, today I just want to you know just wrap up a little bit about ground and then I'll try to find a place where I can finish. Now in the um in the in the seal, brother Bham says something here. We have uh someone may say well we are having our youth for Christ we are making youth meetings every young person in a message must believe and go to the right you may say our church is having a meeting oh we are going to make Crusade. We want so many members. Nothing against that. That's all right. But that is only atmosphere. You are only creating the atmosphere. You don't know who for sure. You don't know how many for sure. But you are only creating atmosphere. That might be an old hen's feathers what you're doing. It may be an old hands feather. But if you will get the right atmosphere that's it. Oh my. [Applause] Yes sir. If you will get the right atmosphere there, it will hatch ego. If you are an eagle, [Music] if there is ego eggs there [Music] and if you were for ordained of God to see it, you can't help from seeing you are coming forth for a resurrection. Oh my. That's why we have church services to create the right atmosphere for the sick. Hallelujah. This place is not for the saved. It's not for the perfect is not for the best in Uganda. But it is a place where it combines the good, the bad, the ugly. We there are many eggs here. But what are we trying to do at &gt;&gt; with all the music? Why do we buy musical instruments? Someone may say, "Pastor, you're wasting money. You're wasting church money this money. We could have done this." Oh my friend, you know nothing about how God works. Having good music is not wasting money. Singing good songs is not a waste of time. Why don't we just come to church and just hear the someone we go? You just don't understand how it works. Why do we sing? Why why do we why why why do they tell you, "Oh, please bring your song and practice it before you sing. Because we are trying to create an atmosphere, the right atmosphere because there are many eggs going to come. Hallelujah. Some are eggs of bats. Some are eggs of hens. Are you following me, church? Some are eggs of pigeons. But I will tell you something. Some are eagle eggs. Hallelujah. Yes sir. Some eagle. Amen. And when eagle eggs come here and the atmosphere is right before even the word comes, you have already been stimulated by the revelation of the atmosphere. You already feel something good coming. You already feel something on the inside which comes out on the outside. And many times people begin shouting. People begin rejoicing. People begin falling what is happening. It is the atmosphere that causes it. And I will tell you something and many times in church services eggs hatch you don't know what eggs. Sometimes they are old eggs. Sometimes they are eggs of hens. You know they cry differently. When a is it will cry like that. Am I speaking mysteries? This is nature. It is reality. Amen. Have you ever seen this kind of old? How does how does all tell us and say on a good day she has fallen don't waste your time thinking leave that alone because even me I don't Some of you will keep opening your eyes. She's the one demons come out of the other one and enters you. Things are happening. When we are in the spirit, everybody be in the spirit. Close your eyes. Be in prayer because things are touching. That's why. Hallelujah. Women when things are happening, we always I take the microphone. I tell you things are happening happening. We don't know what exactly is happening. Sometimes sometimes there is things we don't understand. But I will tell you something. There must be eagles when the word is preached. And many times it is the word bride hatching coming into view. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So when you come, you are coming into a right atmosphere. The song leader sing the right kind of song. The musicians play. Don't just come here without praying. You are coming out of your whatever and you you come and touch away instrument team leader. You have to be very careful. You are the pastor of the music department. You are helping the pastor of the church. Ensure that people are in the right atmosphere. So they can bring people in right at home. Sometimes someone comes with all his data hands and then he touches the instrument. The whole service is real friends. Atmosphere is very important. If you were wondering why we don't do those kind of dances, you know, we can't even do them with this kind of large pullpit. Maybe if you had a small place and then we put it aside and then we call the brothers and sisters in their tight clothing, they begin throwing their legs up, turning here, turning there, turning here, turning there. What kind of dances are those? &gt;&gt; They are worldly dances. The atmosphere they are creating is not the right atmosphere that would hatch eos. But it's the right atmosphere to hatch worldly people. That's right. It will hatch wrong things. That's why you see the way they dress, the way they behave, the way they think, the way they do things, the way they teach is all for entertainment. And we're not really really it's the systems. The people are good. But those systems are bound and they can't understand how this works. So we do this because we are creating the atmosphere. That is why we organize youth camps. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, you might you might wonder this these meetings take a lot of money in millions. Millions millions. What was collected last year? I already told some of you know it already. We had to spend 30 more million from what was collected by you and the people. 30 more million because no one brought it. We had to spend it. So what am I talking about? Is it for what? For a show. Matter of fact, I have never preached in any of the brings people all over the world. Not me. sometimes I think it's been about nine countries. Many young people. This is not to put our church on the map. [Music] This is not to to to give me a name. If I wanted a name, I'd have been calling them and then I preach to them so they can also know I'm a good preacher. This is not about that. It's not about my family. When God calls a man, he gives him every ministry that God has called, he gives them an assignment. [Music] And that's the assignment God gave me. And trust me, every year I've wanted to say every after meeting I say I'm not going to do another one because there's no money for it right from the first one. People are rejoicing and me I'm in my room in my office there completely confused. Oh God this money. What are we going to do? And while you are there testimonies are coming. Test testimonies are coming. Testimonies are coming. So God we are coming next year again coming next year again. Why it is for the purpose of arching the eos. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends. If we spend 100 million on one youth meeting and the the right atmosphere is created then The seed of God is bath. Even if he's one, that's worth it. That is worth it. Friends, you need to understand that we do these things to create an atmosphere. Amen. And if you've noticed, I don't we don't hold these meetings anywhere anywhere. We don't do them anywhere. You go in a place where it looks like as if they put west on the walls and then you come and pray for the Holy Ghost to come in that atmosphere. I believe I'm a stronger believer in if I can't do something and I do it the best I should not even do it at all. And if you DVF church can get that spirit. Oh, we can do a lot together. &gt;&gt; We can do a lot. Where are we collecting money to go buy a church? Are we planning to enrich the pastor? For your information, if I wasn't in ministry, I would have done it better in my life financially. I'm talking financially. But I went ministry and I'm not doing and I'm not doing this for money or for selfish gain. or for something or the other. Why are we looking money for church land? And then you say I will not give. I think these people they are trying to play tricks on us. You can't understand what we are doing. We are get wanting to get a place where an atmosphere can be created where we can have our own building where mothers can have a place where they can go breastfeed. They come here they're breastfeeding and they should have a nursery. where you should have a cry room where mothers go with children where you can have Sunday school places. This is what we have in our mind. We want a better atmosphere. [Music] Who told you only white people should have this? Africans are weakest. and your church member. I said, "Let them do it." And your church member, you need a revival. I'm I'm telling you, you need a revival. If I pray that they may be one even as we are. God wants unity in the body that your pastor came up. He said God has led me to do that. We should help brother Peter and we give him 10 millions. Our sister here we helped some time back. Oh, we we help and we give brother Peter 10 million. Sorry, today I'm picking up on you because you're and then you say huh brother is even better off that should be me. So I will not even give where is the unity. Do you have confidence in the man of God that he has sent you? Do you believe God can speak to him for the body? If you believe that, then you would support everything that we have as a leadership of the Holy Spirit. I know that is surely God. It's not having anything to do with a man. [Music] That's why we organize the youth camp right atmosphere. That's why we listen to the message at home. That's why we pray. Praying God can't save you. Let me tell you it can't. But it helps you to create atmosphere around. That's why we sing. All these things cannot and will not change us if we are none sick. But it can only make you realize who you are. That's what happens. The right atmosphere has to be created. I would stay at home and I would stream. You cannot receive what you would have received if you come here. The atmosphere at home is different. But the atmosphere in the church is also different. You understand what I'm talking about? So atmosphere is very important. And part of it is the good ground, the soil that the seed is planted in. some people are bad ground. I want to find a place to stop now. See the the ground is a problem. You find that someone is a rock. Oh my god, I'm just going to keep myself now. You see, they receive the word with joy cuz there is no root. When temptation comes, you walk away from the word. You know some people are on the roadside. The devil comes and steals what you have heard immediately. Some people are funny. You know you are shocked. You receive the word. You hear the word you receive. You are a seed. But you know you you the the things come and choke that word. the cares of life, desire for riches, pleasures of life, then you end up with no fruit. But God is looking for good ground, a place that I can say you are honest. Hest means when you are wrong, accept you are wrong. Stop pretending. Accept you are wrong. Accept you need help. Accept you need prayer. Accept you need to to to be taught. If you're wrong, you're wrong. Then you see, be honest, you know, have a good heart, not a bad one, not a hard one like a rock, not a sty one. have a good heart, a teachable heart that can keep the word. And then that kind of heart when the seed of the word comes, it takes some time, friends. It doesn't happen immediately. But but the Bible says it will bring fruit with patience. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You keep coming. &gt;&gt; If you are the good ground where then the word comes. Oh God, I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I didn't need that. Change me. Oh God, but when you go back it doesn't appear you are changed. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, keep coming. You receive the word again until people will say you don't know something is happening. It is a good ground for the world. Amen. because they must bring fruit with patience. Patience means there is waiting to do. Some people they want to use the word as witchcraft. They want to come here. Get changed. That's the problem. Even the church is you are not patient. Keep coming. Every promise of God is true. Every word is true. Amen. Keep coming. Keep giving. Keep praying. Keep waiting. I believe for something bigger to come. [Applause] Amen. Amen. The seed can only grow in fatted ground. I have not preached about this thing of good ground very well. We will start on it on Wednesday. Amen. Let us stand on our feet. God bless you. May God help us to always create the right atmosphere [Music] for the word. to perform every promise of God in our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Danius, where are you? Could you come and sing that song again? Lead me, Lord, and I'll follow. I just appreciate the song leaders. Many times they sing songs that are really in the line of what I'm talking about without even me telling them. It just shows that we are walk also waiting upon the voice. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Could you please help me? Let us sing it. Some sisters with some microphones help us sing it. Hallelujah. Sing it with all your heart, brother.

Every work, every promise because he is faithful throughout all the seasons up to the time of the harvest. He is so faithful. Oh. It's just something that has touched my heart friends to know that whatever you are waiting upon the Lord. I want to just encourage you. Our God is faith. Don't be nervous. Don't be anxious.

Praise the name of the Lord. Has the Lord been good to you. Amen. You know friends, as I keep feeding on the word, I find that there is honey in the ro in the song. Oh, there's honey in the row. How many I ever sang that song? We used to sing it many years ago. &gt;&gt; Oh, there is honey in the rock, my brother. Well, there is. Tell your neighbor now. You're telling your neighbor, &gt;&gt; you &gt;&gt; for you. Leave your sins for the blood to cover. But I'll tell you, there is honey in the rock for you. There is a name in the room my brother and my sister. There is a room for you. Oh your father to come. I tell you there is an end for you. Okay. Then we used to sing, have you tested that the Lord is gracious? Do you walk in the way that is new? I tell you, have you drunk from the living fountain? Oh, there is a ro for you. There is a ro. Amen. There is a road for you. You and me your sins to cover. &gt;&gt; I tell you there is in the rock for you. Woo. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is something about those old time. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we should sing them more often. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I have news for the church. &gt;&gt; The good and the bad, &gt;&gt; but the bad depends on how you look at it. The good is going to be good for everybody. But the one like I have the bad is not non-existent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So which ones do you want to to hear first? The bad, &gt;&gt; the good. Everybody says, "I want good news, no bad news." Praise the name of the Lord. The good news is Oh yeah, you can stream this portion and there's a portion which we will not stream but I was being asked whether they should stream them. I know there are those on the internet that are members of the church that I know of. were not able to come. And there are also those that I know like sister Dina all the way in Boston. &gt;&gt; She used to attend a local church there. But the last I heard that she was not able to go to church. She streams every service and she's a very active giver. Uh um I think she gives uh where is the Martin Luther is that is that correct? So she's she's an active giver towards this project and others as well giving so they should hear. Amen. It's like a major update. I'm doing it intentionally to try and raise your expectation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tell your neighbor. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I have in my hand? &gt;&gt; It is copies of two land titles where we are going to build our church. [Applause] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in summary, by faith, we already have our children. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So if the devil thought it is not possible, He's too late. I don't know whether you can see him, but if you can see him, tell him, "Devil, you're too late." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In my hand, I have um um an agreement here. on Tuesday. H on a Tuesday last week, I went with brother Martin to meet the owners of these two plots. Um you remember the there's a meeting we had the first meeting we had um and uh everybody was pushing for no let's have our land, let's have our even if it's in the village. Let's have our land. But there are some standards I cannot agree with. But uh we agreed that uh we should all have our land. We were looking for land in this area. By the time we started um uh two plots were 150 million. You remember those of you who were with us the other side, three years ago, two plots were 150. But now one plot in this area is 150 million or more depending on the location. So it it appear that it is not going to be possible. for us to be able to attain that goal if we just keep collecting funds when we have not booked a plot. But it is impossible to book a plot without a big the biggest chunk. If land is 200 million usually they want 170%. that would be more than 150 or around 140 then so and we had not raised that much and that's why we were not able to book any plot but when we had that meeting here we expanded the uh we realized we cannot now buy around by the time we get so we decided that we we now expand [Music] our perimeters. So we informed you to go out and look and see if you find a good piece of land. You come back and let us where is sister Susan. Could you please stand up? Where's brother? Uh yeah, brother Brian. So brother Brian calls me shortly. I think following day after the meeting and he told me pastor there is a land in it is 200 he told me 250 60 million that's what they told him so um I say no that's too much that's what I told you because all the lands I've seen I mean I know the areas. I have a lot of experience with land in this area for four years. I've been driving everywhere with brokers. So, so he took me to that land and we found sister Susan there. So apparently sister Susan around there crossed that line and she knew that they are set in that line. So she told brother Brian Brian and brother Brian informed me for those of you who don't know sister Susan came to this message through brother Brian Brian uh and also her husband. So we baptized both of them. I think have we baptized his husband as well? &gt;&gt; Yes. So they are both believers. I think they are they believed in this church and uh so you can be seated. So so we went there saw the land as soon as I reached there. I was so excited because the land was good from just a stone throw away from the road. Um those of you who know uh Shell matter of fact after this I want those who can if possible everybody I want us to go there. We claim that land. We see it. We pray. So I I don't need to direct you because I will take you there. So I said, "Okay, the money is a lot, but we found a money." He gave us a contact. We met the owner. The first time he told me ah pastor that land it is 260 million as you can see is on the road you can put anything there. I told him but for us we don't want to put business we want to put a worship center we are Christian &gt;&gt; and also we don't have much so we are requesting you allow us to pay what we have he said how much do you have I said we want to pay we we have a budget I told him we have a budget of 180 million for all that land he laughed And he said, "Do you know L?" I said, "Yes, sure, I do. I'm not saying it's that's what it is worth, but I'm I'm saying that we want you to help us and reduce the amount for us." Well, he said, "No, I cannot give it to you at that much. The best I can do is 240." I said, "No, we don't have 240. Uh I I said he said you have how much? I said we have 180. And um um I I spoke by faith. I told him if you take 180, we will give you 150 up front. And so he got excited. So I told him and then he said no. Since I can see you a buyer, let's um let me give you this land. He kept quiet for a while. He said, "Okay, you are a church. I'm also a Christian. This is what we are going to do. I'm going to give you that land at 225 million." And uh you you pay you you told me your payment plan. I came back here and I told you about that. Many of you already know. So now the information you don't know is when we went back with brother Martin on on I think was it brother Martin Monday or Tuesday? I now forget. Uhhuh. We went back there. &gt;&gt; I think on Monday. So I told him um sir we we want to give you a small down payment on the loan and then we pay the rest in one year. He loved he said you can't buy land like you're buying tomatoes but he said pastor not to waste your time. Uh have you first of all agreed with the total sum I I told him no we have not we would like to pay at least 220. [Music] He said no the 5 million is for the brokers. I told him no we don't have brokers. So then I said our sister in the church the brother are the ones who directed us to this land. He said no but there's someone who gave you my contract. I said, "Well, you can call him." So, he called him. He said, "Yes, I'm the one who gets the contact. I'm a neighbor here. I need to be paid." And also, there is another woman who brought them. So, uh the man then says um well um these ones are saying they had no broker. It is a a member of their church who brought them. Long story short, the sister, they call her and she says, "I know me. I don't want money. It's our church. We are buying for me. I'm sorted. Let them sort." So he said, "Okay, fine. What whatever they want to give me." So I told I told the man, "You see, so this 5 million you are putting it." He told me how much are you willing to give him? I told him tell him 500 instead of 5 million you know certain things you speak by faith. The man was they told him the pastor is saying 500,000. He said no at least 1 million or at least 700. and finally says, "Okay, it's all right." If the other lady is saying she doesn't want anything 500, okay, fine, no problem. And so the 225 becomes 220 500,000. [Music] Um and um so um he says okay so how are you going to pay? I told him I told you already how you're going to pay. He said okay pastor do this. Give me 100 millions cash within one month from now and the rest. He said something which brother Martin and I were shocked. He said the rest you can pay in eight months. And um and uh he said but for me to wait for you to raise the 100 million within 30 days I need to remove this land from the market. You need to commit to me that you are going to buy this. And if you give me your commitment fee and you don't raise that money, you will forget your commitment and that commit payment fee is 10 million. Then in the 8 months uh in the in the in the in one month you bring um uh 90 million to make a 100. I looked at brother Martin. He looked at me. We looked at him and we told him give us the payment details and we paid the 10 million share. Now those who don't have faith are already saying this is the bad news. We are going to lose 10 million. Can I have a report on how much we have brother? Can you can you bring me the report for Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need the whole file. I need only the report for this. &gt;&gt; I know you have a lot of records, but I only want the record for today. &gt;&gt; Okay. M &gt;&gt; um so [Music] uh to as of today we have this money I'm going to read includes the 30 million shillings which we used on the youth meeting which we need to which I said I'm going to find which I do not which we don't have. But I believe by the end of the month myself and those of you who have who are going to receive the faith for this will raise that much and the remainder of it as well. So as of today we have 93 million 779,000 [Music] which means we need to find how much 6,400,000 6,300,000. &gt;&gt; That's what we need. Yeah. &gt;&gt; We need to find 6.3 between now and 7th August. If we don't, we are going to lose 10 million. Are you hearing me church? So you need to look for 6.3 million and then we take the 90 million and pay it on that land and then the rest we can now talk how we going to raise the rest will be 120 million 500,000 which I'll need to look for 15 million per month. If you go to the bank, they can give you this money, but then you will pay it in five years and you will end up paying double. We can look for this money. We can work as a team. Those of you who have not been giving, this is your church. It's our church. You start giving even if it is small. Just be giving and we will raise this money. So I want to speak like Joshua and Khaled. We are more than able to take this land. Now if you are among the 10 because I know these amounts are given by the minority in this church. Not the majority, the minority. So if you're among the 10 who are saying it is impossible, my brother, my sister, me, I'm among the few, the Joshua and the who are saying even if the land has giants, we are more than able to take it. And I'm going to keep raising money. I'm going to ask my friends. I'm going to ask my brothers. I'm going to ask my sisters. And we're going to raise this money. How many are going to do that in your group where you are and we raise this money? So this is what we need to do. But I tell you friends, going forward, we are now looking for money. We are going to look for money and we know where we're going to invest it. But if you don't have faith, I'm asking you to do one thing. Make sure when we are going to the land now, you come with us. Because when you see faith will come. Have you had church? All right. So, how many are planning to go to the raise up your hand eyes? Okay. How many are not going going to go? Raise up your hand. Okay. Okay. I see the majority are going. for directions. Um uh if when you reach after the Protestant shrine and uh I I think I'd like you to uh put off the uh the streaming for now. My of you have been following, God bless you. Pray for us. Join us. Let's do this. Amen. So when you reach the Protestant shrine, you continue you will find Starbucks. You continue through that valley. &gt;&gt; Yeah. which has a swamp. What would you be wonderful [Music] when we sing? We enter the glory. Won't it be wonderful there? Tell me the troules and cares on our story line. Won't it be wonderful? Won't be wonderful there. [Music] Having nobody else to bear joyously singing with bells are ringing. Want to be will never walking and talking with Christ the SP won't it be wonderful there [Music] praising adoring the bless won't be one who want It be wonderful there. I mean nobody should be joyously singing.
