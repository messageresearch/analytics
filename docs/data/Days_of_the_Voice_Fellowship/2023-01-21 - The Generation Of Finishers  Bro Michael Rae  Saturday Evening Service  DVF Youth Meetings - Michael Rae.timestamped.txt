[32:40] foreign
[33:38] it's worth it all foreign
[34:05] amen so let's just press into the
[34:07] kingdom a little bit more tonight
[34:11] let's turn to our Bibles in Luke 14.
[34:30] we're going to start at verse 25.
[34:40] I'm just going to speak tonight
[34:42] on a title maybe we'll just call it uh
[34:46] we'll just stay with a theme I guess
[34:48] that we've been setting um
[34:52] we started with a generation
[34:54] unrestrained
[34:56] a generation of power
[35:02] and tonight maybe we'll just be going to
[35:03] generation of finishers
[35:11] verse 25 and Luke 14.
[35:16] and there went great multitudes with him
[35:19] and he turned and said unto them
[35:21] If any man come unto me and hate not his
[35:24] father and mother
[35:26] and wife children
[35:29] Brethren sisters
[35:31] yea and his own life also he cannot be
[35:37] my disciple
[35:53] foreign
[35:59] foreign
[36:03] verse 28
[36:05] sorry verse 27 and whosoever does not
[36:07] bear his cross and come after me cannot
[36:10] be my disciple
[36:14] um
[36:21] for which of you intending to build a
[36:24] tower sitteth not down first and
[36:26] counteth the cost whether he have
[36:29] sufficient to finish it
[36:31] foreign
[36:46] he is not able to finish it all that
[36:49] beheld it begin to mock him saying this
[36:52] man began to build and was not able
[37:12] um
[37:13] amen amen amen you may have receipts
[37:16] tonight
[37:20] I want to focus on that scripture
[37:25] he that he has to count the cost
[37:29] if he was intending to build a tower
[37:34] Jesus is saying he would sit down
[37:36] shouldn't he sit down first yes
[37:39] and count the cost
[37:42] whether he has sufficient
[37:46] to finish it no one wants to be in a
[37:50] position
[37:51] where is Jesus said in verse 29 yes
[37:54] I would behold and begin to mock him uh
[38:00] the feeling of being able to accomplish
[38:03] something
[38:07] feeling
[38:12] like something a project or something in
[38:15] life where you you had anybody create
[38:17] to-do lists
[38:21] I mean there's a lot of things wrong you
[38:23] can do on these devices but I don't know
[38:25] do you use this for a to-do list anybody
[38:27] use one of these to do for to do you
[38:29] know
[38:31] yeah okay
[38:34] thank you he keeps things in check
[38:38] because you want to know okay I got this
[38:41] to do I got that to do I got some tasks
[38:43] here
[38:47] then you're able to go back and you're
[38:49] like yeah
[38:51] did that you know
[38:56] you keep track of your accomplishments
[39:00] and it feels good to check it off
[39:05] are we all human here
[39:10] you know that some people actually will
[39:12] create a to-do list
[39:16] for tasks they've already done
[39:21] just so they can check it off
[39:27] believe it or not because it's human
[39:29] nature we enjoy there's something that
[39:31] we receive when we're able to check off
[39:33] I did it
[39:37] it's over
[39:40] and there's a feeling of accomplishment
[39:46] that's just how we're built it's
[39:48] Humanity
[39:50] but when something is in your back your
[39:53] mind
[39:54] and you know it's kind of left
[39:56] unfinished
[39:58] oh that's not a good feeling
[40:02] it just kind of sits there wearing at
[40:05] you
[40:08] you haven't been able to finish it yet
[40:13] because some things are hard to finish
[40:18] it takes a little bit of effort to
[40:21] finish
[40:23] yeah some certain projects that you want
[40:25] you want to attain
[40:28] maybe it's a degree in school that you
[40:30] want to get um
[40:32] you have a certain profession you want
[40:34] to make
[40:37] there's a lot of effort involved to get
[40:40] there again
[40:43] it takes time
[40:45] it takes money
[40:47] it takes sacrifice
[40:50] takes determination
[40:53] all of that's required
[40:56] so at the end of that period of time
[41:00] you can say I did it
[41:06] you can check the box off
[41:09] yes Amina
[41:12] but then if you leave them you know
[41:14] certain tasks it's kind of lingering and
[41:15] lingering
[41:18] it can kind of start to churn you up a
[41:21] little bit
[41:24] sometimes though then something strikes
[41:26] ya
[41:28] I'm gonna get that done
[41:32] right man does that feel good
[41:36] but a builder as scripture was stating
[41:39] here a builder
[41:41] he will plan yeah
[41:44] he'll prepare yeah
[41:48] years in advance
[41:53] he orders supplies
[41:57] he gets his workers lined up
[42:02] he calculates what is needed to finish
[42:05] that
[42:09] correct because Jesus said he wouldn't
[42:12] want to stand there
[42:16] yeah you know what I'm just going to
[42:17] start this project right there in
[42:20] foreign
[42:52] to his community
[42:54] [Music]
[42:56] that's right no one's no one's star
[42:58] let's go to the to the example of a
[43:00] racer as we've done over these last few
[43:02] services
[43:07] or how about a soccer team
[43:10] who went to the FIFA World Cup this last
[43:12] few months ago
[43:15] I know nobody here you know watched or
[43:18] tracked that
[43:20] of course not um
[43:23] huh oh you did okay
[43:31] I don't know what team you were looking
[43:33] for
[43:36] we'll leave it right there
[43:38] but no soccer team going to FIFA World
[43:41] Cup
[43:43] not one of them
[43:46] get on to them get into the match again
[43:50] get playing their heart out
[43:54] and halfway through the first half
[43:57] yeah we're done with this
[44:01] we're just walking off the pitch
[44:04] we don't have it we don't have it in us
[44:08] we'll never make it
[44:13] they didn't get nobody even thinks of
[44:15] doing that
[44:17] they are determined
[44:20] to go all the way
[44:23] they're gonna finish that game
[44:26] they're gonna give every ounce of energy
[44:29] possible
[44:31] to try and win
[44:36] they figured out what they need to do
[44:40] no hiker
[44:42] [Music]
[44:44] the hiker like uh
[44:46] hiking up a mountain
[44:50] a hiker going up Mount Everest Everest
[44:56] he would not get halfway
[44:58] um
[45:05] and just go halfway
[45:09] you don't do that
[45:12] you train
[45:14] you prepare
[45:17] you get supplies ready huh no no no
[45:20] foreign
[45:39] [Music]
[45:56] foreign
[46:27] foreign
[46:33] but we have a mighty Champion
[46:38] greater than any Expedition
[46:41] greater than any athlete
[46:45] that was able to speak those words
[46:49] in scripture
[46:52] amen only in the New Testament
[46:56] other words it is finished
[47:00] because only one
[47:04] was able to lay claim to that word
[47:08] it says in John 19.
[47:12] after this Jesus knowing that all things
[47:15] were now accomplished
[47:18] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[47:22] saith I thirst
[47:24] he said now there's a vessel full of
[47:27] vinegar
[47:29] and they filled a sponge with vinegar
[47:32] they put hisself upon it uh Tennessee
[47:34] put it to his mouth
[47:37] and when Jesus therefore had received
[47:40] the vinegar yes
[47:43] he said it
[47:45] nagamba is
[47:47] finish
[47:49] amen and he bowed his head
[47:53] and gave up the ghost now are you
[47:57] the more you're with
[47:58] that word in Scripture
[48:00] it is finished
[48:03] it's a translation of the word with the
[48:05] word in Greek to tell us
[48:10] and I want you to grab a hold of what
[48:12] this means
[48:14] because it's not just oh I finished
[48:16] something
[48:19] I checked that off on my to-do list
[48:23] it's not a past tense word
[48:28] it's a present tense word
[48:33] because it doesn't just speak as
[48:35] something that happened two thousand
[48:37] years ago
[48:41] it means it's happened then
[48:44] and what happened then is still in
[48:46] effect today
[48:51] he wasn't just saying well everything
[48:54] then is accomplished
[48:57] redemption's plan is all
[49:24] it's finished
[49:29] amen men have goals
[49:32] oh they say I accomplish this
[49:35] I got my doctorate
[49:38] I did a certain I climbed a certain
[49:41] Mountain
[49:43] but no one yeah could say the words
[49:48] it is finished like Jesus could not yes
[49:53] amen Amino
[49:56] before Jesus said those words
[50:00] he waited out
[50:07] think about the cost
[50:09] a muedo
[50:12] that he had to go through
[50:15] before he could speak those words
[50:20] when he said it is finished
[50:22] the whole book is
[50:27] Allah
[50:29] and the prophets never nothing all that
[50:32] was spoken of him
[50:33] all the prophecies all the types and
[50:37] shadows
[50:46] all the types
[50:48] from the red heifer to the turtle dove
[50:53] to Solomon's Temple
[50:56] oh we're fulfilled in him
[51:00] every prophecy
[51:02] every dream
[51:04] every aspect of scripture
[51:07] we're wrapped up in him
[51:10] and it all had to be done for him to be
[51:14] able to say it is finished
[51:19] let's just take let's just take Jesus
[51:21] Christ let's put him on the put put him
[51:23] to the side here
[51:26] and I don't want to give you the Old
[51:28] Testament
[51:30] let's just say we give the Old Testament
[51:32] to a wise man
[51:36] I got a problem for you to figure out
[51:41] I want you to go home
[51:43] I want you to construct in your
[51:46] imagination
[51:48] the ideal character
[51:51] who shall exactly fit
[51:56] all that's foreshadowed in description
[52:01] okay well that's a big task yeah I need
[52:04] you to find that person
[52:06] remember
[52:09] he's got to be like Moses he's got to be
[52:13] like Moses
[52:15] but he's going to be a champion like
[52:17] Joshua
[52:19] but it must be like Aaron and
[52:21] Melchizedek
[52:23] he's got to be like David
[52:25] like Solomon
[52:27] he's got to be represented in Noah yeah
[52:34] in Joseph oh
[52:37] I gotta find somebody that matches all
[52:39] all those Shadows
[52:41] every one of you are not can't miss one
[52:44] he's a line of the tribe of Judah yeah
[52:49] he was the perfect type in Joseph
[52:52] [Music]
[53:09] he must be like the altar yeah
[53:12] the Tabernacle The Mercy Seat the show
[53:15] bread
[53:20] the wise man is just like I I know I
[53:22] can't I find something like that
[53:26] I'm gonna remind you
[53:29] some of those prophecies are seem
[53:31] contradictory
[53:34] remember if scripture says all Kings
[53:36] shall fall before him
[53:38] and all nations Shall Serve him
[53:41] but yet this one oh no has to be
[53:45] despised and rejected of all men
[53:49] he must be a man of Sorrows
[53:52] but he's also born of a virgin
[53:55] because a virgin shall can see
[54:00] Amina this must be a man without spots
[54:03] without blemish but yet one upon whom
[54:07] the Lord
[54:09] one upon whom the Lord
[54:11] does cause to meet all our iniquities
[54:16] he must be the Glorious one I think
[54:20] son of David
[54:22] dry ground
[54:27] how am I to find somebody like that
[54:30] and you can take all the intellectuals
[54:33] of the world
[54:34] they could get together huh they could
[54:37] get together
[54:39] go to the scripture
[54:41] search through all of history
[54:44] searching for one man
[54:47] one person that could meet every one of
[54:50] those criteria
[54:53] I tell you they could not do it
[54:57] and they so the wise man would have to
[55:00] come back
[55:05] I have to just Proclaim
[55:08] but there's no other
[55:11] than the Cross of Christ and the Son of
[55:15] God
[55:16] that's the only one that can match every
[55:20] single one of those scriptures
[55:24] when he said it is finished
[55:27] every single one of those scriptures
[55:30] every prophecy but it would not be every
[55:34] shadowed in him
[55:36] brother Brandon says when Jesus came yes
[55:40] he was the word in its fullness
[55:45] because the whole Plan of Redemption
[55:47] laid in him
[55:50] it didn't lay in Moses
[55:53] it didn't lay in Joseph
[55:56] it didn't land Elijah
[55:58] they were part of the world
[56:05] Amen he said see the whole plan wasn't
[56:08] in them they were pointing to it
[56:15] so here Jesus now
[56:18] as he's coming up to the cross
[56:22] the cost is needing to be counted
[56:28] and he gets to Gethsemane
[56:31] he gets on his knees
[56:45] he didn't say wait
[56:48] I wasn't quite ready for this cost
[56:52] I don't know this is too hard to carry
[56:56] he didn't get up from his knees and say
[56:58] no can't do it
[57:00] it's too great
[57:03] it's just too much I can't yeah
[57:08] he counted the cost
[57:10] so that he had exactly in mind what he
[57:13] needed
[57:16] as the great drops of sweating blood
[57:19] went from his brows
[57:22] he started to feel the burden
[57:25] the cost
[57:27] door of what it was going to take
[57:31] to get rid of
[57:33] and he starts to wrestle through the
[57:34] garden
[57:37] for you and I he says
[57:41] he says no my bride When My bride is too
[57:44] valuable to me
[57:47] Nothing's Gonna Stop Me
[57:49] I'm gonna go to Hollywood all the way I
[57:52] gotta finish this
[57:53] he was alone and denied
[58:00] my loved one
[58:03] she's lost
[58:05] sin created a Chasm
[58:08] she's bound
[58:11] I'm gonna finish it
[58:15] he gets hauled into herod's court
[58:18] they take him and bind him
[58:21] there they start to beat him and they
[58:25] bruise him
[58:27] and every single time he takes a blow
[58:31] he says I'm gonna finish it
[58:34] I have someone in Uganda
[58:37] is my blood on his cross
[58:43] Uganda
[58:46] Satan stood watching saying there's no
[58:48] way
[58:51] he's not able to accomplish
[58:54] do you know the cost required
[59:01] and they started with
[59:04] they scorched him
[59:15] in his mind
[59:24] spit roll off his face as
[59:28] a shoulder spit this alive on his cheeks
[59:33] I'm finishing
[59:37] [Applause]
[59:38] was placed on his head
[59:45] I can just see in his heart he said
[59:49] I'm gonna go all the way
[59:52] he brought a cross up the hill for you
[59:55] when he was out of strength
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:12] I'm not stopping halfway
[1:00:17] Hallelujah
[1:00:19] laid out his hands on the cross
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:22] and the Romans drove took the nail place
[1:00:35] I'm finishing it I'm finishing it is up
[1:00:40] has he hung there on a tree
[1:00:43] naked
[1:00:48] gasping for final breath
[1:00:58] if one prophecy
[1:01:00] had been missed
[1:01:03] all of it would have been broken
[1:01:06] it would have been all broken
[1:01:09] everything had to be accomplished for
[1:01:12] the words full effect
[1:01:14] that's why scripture says
[1:01:17] scripture says when all things were
[1:01:20] accomplished that the scripture might be
[1:01:23] fulfilled
[1:01:24] scripture has to be fulfilled
[1:01:27] God's word cannot lie if he had a type
[1:01:31] and Shadow in the Old Testament
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:34] it had to match perfectly
[1:01:37] foreign
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:45] but one was left
[1:02:51] one was left
[1:03:00] that the scripture would be accomplished
[1:03:04] he had to make sure that everything else
[1:03:06] prior had transpired exactly according
[1:03:11] to scriptures
[1:03:16] there's one more foreign
[1:03:50] since curse had been paid
[1:03:53] those are the three most beautiful words
[1:03:55] why do we know that you and I could ever
[1:03:57] hear why do we know
[1:04:03] oh that's something worth praising about
[1:04:04] yeah
[1:04:05] there's a lot of things that you could
[1:04:08] say
[1:04:10] but the most beautiful words
[1:04:15] is it it's finished
[1:05:11] sin has no more hole
[1:05:15] when he screamed it is finished
[1:05:19] it did

[1:07:03] he said God can see your sins
[1:07:11] he said where are they buried
[1:07:14] in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:07:17] he said God cannot remember them no more

[1:15:07] provided
[1:15:09] the unbeliever being separated from his
[1:15:11] sins
[1:15:14] then he looks towards the congregation
[1:15:17] we're talking about the Tabernacle
[1:15:21] there was an outer court
[1:15:25] and the holiest of holies
[1:15:28] you can pass through the waters
[1:15:31] separation

[1:15:35] and looking now he said towards the
[1:15:37] congregation
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:53] he said we have to realize the word

[1:16:16] he says you can have Fellowship in the
[1:16:19] outer Court
[1:16:21] you can have fellowship with other other
[1:16:24] people in the inner court
[1:16:28] but to fellowship with God
[1:16:32] you have to go into the presence of God
[1:16:38] he said that's into the Shekinah Glory
[1:16:44] it's only a halfway walk brothers and
[1:16:47] sisters
[1:16:49] if you recognize well I'm separated from
[1:16:52] sin amen

[1:18:25] even recognizing the blood that atones
[1:18:39] for Fellowship
[1:18:41] you needed to go into the prayer okay
[1:18:48] that's why we've been made Kings and
[1:18:49] Priests
[1:18:55] could go once a year
[1:18:59] but Jesus on the cross of Calvary
[1:19:03] made a way for you and me

[1:19:17] to step foot in the Old Testament

[1:26:15] this weekend
[1:26:17] to clean it out
[1:26:20] but you can't leave it right there

[1:30:22] holies
[1:30:24] okay I mean he said all down through the
[1:30:28] generations
[1:30:30] when a man entered in Beyond the Veil
[1:30:36] when a high priest stepped into the
[1:30:39] inner Veil

[1:31:12] some kind of emotional or mental makeup
[1:31:15] you don't have to take something from

[1:31:19] said but every believer
[1:31:22] that comes from the altar to a
[1:31:24] consecrated life
[1:31:31] cannot get only a mouthful
[1:31:40] of the original baptism
[1:31:46] not some halfway mixed up things
[1:32:01] don't you dare take anything less

[2:17:52] Hallelujah
[2:18:00] what an atmosphere tonight
[2:18:05] amen Amina
[2:18:10] foreign
[2:18:13] how many here
[2:18:16] in this Congregation of 40 years and
[2:18:18] below
[2:18:25] out straight
[2:18:29] now I wanted to look around
[2:18:32] while you raise your hand look around
[2:18:34] in Kono so you can put it down
[2:18:39] almost almost
[2:18:41] more than 95 percent of us here are
[2:18:44] beautiful
[2:18:48] 40 by the Barnum said that 40 is a
[2:18:50] generation
[2:18:55] in brother Isaac said he's 44. Brothers
[2:19:01] it's an age group
[2:19:03] is that okay how old are you
[2:19:07] he's 40. yewana
[2:19:10] you just made 40.
[2:19:13] is it your birthday
[2:19:17] is Battle just passed away
[2:19:21] I I don't know I think I'm 32.
[2:19:26] brother Ken how old are you
[2:19:31] 30.
[2:19:32] 27. brother Enoch how old are you
[2:19:44] but the Enoch is 30.
[2:19:46] I didn't ask sisters because with
[2:19:48] Brothers we are okay with that
[2:19:54] we don't have a problem telling our age
[2:19:58] the reason I did that some writing
[2:20:00] concession
[2:20:02] is to say
[2:20:05] a whole generation
[2:20:09] is in our handsafe
[2:20:14] if you've not noticed
[2:20:16] even here in our country
[2:20:18] there is a generation passing
[2:20:22] and there is a generation coming on
[2:20:26] things cannot always be the same
[2:20:30] change must come
[2:20:34] and if you live a little longer even in
[2:20:37] politics
[2:20:38] soon in our country things will change
[2:20:46] it's a must it's going to happen soon
[2:20:51] that's the truth
[2:20:54] most of our parents
[2:20:57] are above 50.
[2:21:00] others above 60.
[2:21:02] some of your parents are pastors
[2:21:06] how many pastors children are here raise
[2:21:08] up your house
[2:21:12] so it's okay
[2:21:15] so you see we have a lot of pastors
[2:21:20] so most of you pastors
[2:21:25] are your fathers
[2:21:27] and to some of you are your grandfathers
[2:21:31] there is a generation
[2:21:34] and there is a generation coming on
[2:21:37] there is something I want to impress on
[2:21:40] you in just a few moments before we we
[2:21:42] dismissed
[2:21:45] that our whole generation is in our
[2:21:47] hands
[2:21:49] and I just wrote these words by
[2:21:51] inspiration as our brother Michael was
[2:21:52] speaking nothing
[2:21:55] a whole generation is in our hands
[2:21:59] what shall we do with it
[2:22:03] our elders did their best
[2:22:09] and we in enough all of us here are the
[2:22:12] result of their work
[2:22:18] we know that our elders
[2:22:21] our pastors not all of them agree with
[2:22:25] one another
[2:22:29] not necessarily in Doctrine
[2:22:33] but maybe in some principles and in the
[2:22:36] way they do things
[2:22:39] and some of you who are a little mature
[2:22:41] you know that one church does not work
[2:22:43] with another one
[2:22:50] and I was speaking with one some of our
[2:22:54] ministers here at days of the voice
[2:22:58] of the voice and I told them nimba Gamba
[2:23:02] we call
[2:23:03] I know and I'm saying this with all
[2:23:06] humility
[2:23:08] and I told them I said this is a neutral
[2:23:11] place
[2:23:16] and that
[2:23:18] I felt about it to call a youth meeting
[2:23:23] because this is my generation
[2:23:26] and that this is a neutral place
[2:23:31] no brother find the right word it's I
[2:23:34] don't know somebody help you I need this
[2:23:36] to be passed only the right way
[2:23:39] brother Center where are you
[2:23:43] where is brother Center
[2:23:48] I'm requesting to kindly help me just
[2:23:50] for two minutes just come up
[2:24:00] thank you brother Alex
[2:24:03] and and I was saying that this I told
[2:24:06] them that this is a neutral Place
[2:24:07] foreign
[2:24:48] foreign
[2:26:07] taco
[2:26:30] and if you notice that all the preachers
[2:26:34] in these meetings you know are young
[2:26:37] people
[2:26:41] foreign
[2:27:15] 29 is 29.
[2:27:18] his father was a pastor and he is now a
[2:27:22] pastor
[2:27:23] where is your church brother
[2:27:26] he is
[2:27:29] a young Pastor
[2:27:33] I want this point to sink
[2:27:36] because he has received it by
[2:27:38] inspiration
[2:27:41] there is a generation
[2:27:46] it's not because I said it
[2:27:49] but because it is the reality
[2:27:56] if the lotteries
[2:27:59] we also like our elders like our fathers
[2:28:02] nothing
[2:28:04] we have an opportunity
[2:28:16] I'm sorry to be emotional friends it's
[2:28:18] it's just cutting me deep because
[2:28:24] we have an opportunity
[2:28:27] to finish what they started
[2:28:34] when his message came to them
[2:28:36] they were on fire
[2:28:38] they didn't have smartphones smartphone
[2:28:41] they didn't they didn't a few of them
[2:28:43] had access even to email but you know
[2:28:46] a few of them had computers
[2:28:50] some of them were just reading the
[2:28:52] message after writing it on paper
[2:28:57] when the when they received the tape
[2:29:00] of the message they were fighting
[2:29:05] we will listen to it
[2:29:08] some of you may not know about these
[2:29:11] things
[2:29:12] and then a book they were borrowing from
[2:29:15] one to another uh
[2:29:19] but our generation
[2:29:22] fake we have smartphones everywhere
[2:29:24] between a smartphone now we have iPad
[2:29:26] trainers we have computers between a
[2:29:28] computer electrified with electronics to
[2:29:30] enabled because technology
[2:29:33] [Music]
[2:29:38] the whole message is
[2:29:43] 20 of you
[2:29:47] but what is our what has our generation
[2:29:50] done about it
[2:29:54] we have put it on the pillow
[2:29:57] some of you may not maybe you've never
[2:30:00] even listened to one tip one message
[2:30:08] we are so busy today
[2:30:22] you find one young lady
[2:30:29] I don't know I don't want to make it
[2:30:32] like so big but it is true you find them
[2:30:34] speaking with hundreds of Brothers
[2:30:44] sincerely are you looking for a husband
[2:30:47] like that
[2:30:49] foreign
[2:31:19] [Music]
[2:31:31] because how will they come back here
[2:31:35] if someone has not gone
[2:31:38] how shall they go
[2:31:41] except they Ascent
[2:31:44] but how can you be sent to me without
[2:31:48] having an encounter with God
[2:31:51] when you have never received the Holy
[2:31:54] Spirit
[2:31:56] remember
[2:32:16] foreign
[2:32:30] [Music]
[2:33:06] good music
[2:33:10] and after when the preacher comes on the
[2:33:13] pulpit
[2:33:15] they disappear
[2:33:18] um
[2:33:31] and
[2:33:34] these days we stream our services
[2:33:57] now tell me
[2:33:59] how can we have an atmosphere
[2:34:04] for something like this that happened
[2:34:06] here to happen in our churches
[2:34:15] we have made our pastors we have
[2:34:17] burdened them
[2:34:20] instead of them preaching to us the word
[2:34:22] foreign
[2:34:53] here is what I'm
[2:34:55] just imploring
[2:35:02] let us come to a realization
[2:35:07] that we should take this responsibility
[2:35:12] should rest on our shoulders
[2:35:14] if there is anything we are going to
[2:35:16] take from these youth meetings
[2:35:20] let us
[2:35:23] go with the burden
[2:35:26] okay
[2:35:28] and responsibility of knowing now you
[2:35:32] are the one responsible you
[2:35:36] you wake up because
[2:35:42] you where you are the one who is
[2:35:45] responsible
[2:35:46] for this message now
[2:35:52] some of you may not know it but you're
[2:35:53] going to be past us soon
[2:36:00] and some of you are going to be pastors
[2:36:01] wives
