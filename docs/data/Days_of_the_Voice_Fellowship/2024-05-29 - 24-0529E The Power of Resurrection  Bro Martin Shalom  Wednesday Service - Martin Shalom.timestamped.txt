[36:12] receive something from you Lord father
[36:15] for we have us all in Christ Jesus we
[36:17] pray amen you have you can have your
[36:21] seat praise be to
[36:24] God yeah it is quite an interesting
[36:27] testimony about uh
[36:31] Lazarus death and
[36:33] Resurrection blessed be the name of the
[36:35] Lord
[36:36] Jesus and this
[36:39] evening uh yesterday was when I was told
[36:42] to stand I was
[36:45] wondering what to say I was asking God
[36:50] you know yesterday you came back when
[36:51] too
[36:53] exhausted so but I trust uh
[36:57] God that this evening he has given me
[37:00] something that we going to share in the
[37:02] few minutes we are going to spend
[37:04] here amen and I'm going to talk uh about
[37:08] the power of Resurrection or
[37:11] resurrection power blessed be the name
[37:13] of the Lord we are here because of that
[37:17] amen how many believe that we shall
[37:22] resurrect how many believe that he will
[37:25] resurrect amen
[37:28] yeah there's a
[37:29] Resurrection coming and already going on
[37:32] even now blessed be the name of the Lord
[37:35] and here where we have read uh I've put
[37:39] down some
[37:40] scriptures uh that we are maybe God
[37:43] willing we
[37:45] shall peep on
[37:47] them and uh we are seeing in John where
[37:50] we have just
[37:53] read the story of Martha
[37:59] and
[38:01] uh uh and Lazarus blessed be the name of
[38:04] the Lord and we are seeing here Jesus is
[38:07] the key
[38:09] point the bible say that when Jesus
[38:11] heard that the first time he heard about
[38:14] Lazarus death he did not
[38:17] come but he
[38:19] continued with the gospel blessed be the
[38:22] name of the Lord it is because Jesus he
[38:25] say that there's nothing I can do L my
[38:28] father shows
[38:30] me so when Lazarus
[38:33] died the father told him to
[38:36] continue with a saving of Soul business
[38:40] because death is not Shock to God
[38:43] blessed be the name of the Lord the
[38:45] power of life and the power of death is
[38:48] in the hands of God blessed be the name
[38:51] of the Lord and here where we have read
[38:55] if you read from 23
[38:58] it says that uh Jesus said unto her he
[39:04] was telling Martha thy brother shall
[39:07] rise again Jesus was very sure that this
[39:12] man was dead and mother said unto him I
[39:16] know
[39:18] that he shall rise again in the
[39:23] resurrection at the last day blessed be
[39:26] the name of the Lord
[39:28] Lord Mara believed in the
[39:31] resurrection but at the last day blessed
[39:35] be the name of the Lord amen Mata
[39:38] believed he knew that Jesus that his
[39:41] brother that Lazarus would rise or would
[39:43] resurrect but in the last day and the
[39:47] prophet tells us that the devil
[39:51] always shows
[39:55] us what happened and what will happen in
[39:58] the
[40:00] future blessed be the name of the Lord
[40:03] and it does not want us to know what is
[40:06] happening right now blessed be the name
[40:08] of the Lord and I remember one time one
[40:10] Minister preached and he told us that uh
[40:13] when Jesus or when the disciples were
[40:17] talking about Jesus the devil was was
[40:20] busy enjoying his
[40:21] seat by the day after the Pentecost when
[40:25] the devil had
[40:27] that the lame man at the gate of
[40:30] beautiful God made him to walk that day
[40:34] the devil came out of his seat and then
[40:36] it caused chaos blessed be the name of
[40:39] the Lord because this men they proved to
[40:42] the world that the same Jesus who died
[40:45] and rose again and went to heaven came
[40:48] back and is now dwelling in US blessed
[40:51] be the name of the Lord and there the
[40:53] devil started to wage war with them
[40:56] praise be to God
[40:58] and the reason why God sent this message
[41:00] is to remind us that Jesus Christ is the
[41:04] same yesterday is the same today and
[41:07] forever and the difference between as
[41:09] and denomination is that we know that
[41:12] the same Jesus who walked here on Earth
[41:15] 2,000 years ago the same Jesus who came
[41:18] back on the day of Pentecost in the time
[41:20] of the disciple that same Jesus is
[41:23] living in the Believers today blessed be
[41:27] the name of the Lord amen that is what
[41:30] maketh difference amen I'm talking about
[41:33] the resurrection power or you call the
[41:36] power of
[41:37] Resurrection the power of
[41:40] Resurrection is in is within the circle
[41:44] of Christianity blessed be the name of
[41:46] the Lord and we shall see scripture
[41:49] where Jesus referred himself as he is
[41:53] the resurrection and life blessed be the
[41:56] name of the Lord there's no man in
[41:58] history who had ever made such a
[42:01] statement apart from the Lord Jesus
[42:04] because he was God in flesh praise be to
[42:08] God Amen and the reason asked why we
[42:12] come to
[42:13] church what make a difference between us
[42:16] and
[42:16] denomination it is that power of
[42:21] Resurrection when we were in Catholic we
[42:24] used to sing and say we shall rise
[42:27] Hallelujah we shall
[42:28] rise but in fact the kind of
[42:34] Resurrection or Rising we're talking
[42:36] about is the same one which Martha is
[42:39] speaking about here that I know that my
[42:42] brother shall rise but in the last day
[42:46] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[42:49] that's what the devil want you do
[42:51] whatever you want you live the kind of
[42:53] life you want but if you die you will
[42:55] rise in the last day that is a big lie
[42:59] which kind of Resurrection are you going
[43:01] to resurrect
[43:05] to they will resurrect there are those
[43:08] who resurrect to face the white Throne
[43:10] judgment but there is a group of people
[43:13] who are going to be raptured amen and
[43:16] still what is going to make us being
[43:19] raptured is that resurrection power and
[43:23] that resurrection power lies in the word
[43:25] of God and that is the life of God in
[43:28] The Believer blessed be the name of the
[43:31] Lord amen out outside there they sing we
[43:36] shall
[43:40] rise we shall rise in the day of Our
[43:42] Lord but when you tell them that God
[43:46] heals diseases they say it is impossible
[43:49] you
[43:50] see so if you are doubting that God can
[43:54] heal fever
[43:57] cancer
[44:00] AES how can you convince us that you
[44:03] will
[44:07] resurrect look here you died maybe 50
[44:12] years Jesus comes after 50 years when
[44:16] you already died many years ago how are
[44:20] sure our assuring us that you shall
[44:22] resurrect when you are doubting the
[44:25] power of Divine Healing that is a big
[44:27] lie blessed be the name of the Lord
[44:31] amen hallelujah but we are obtaining oh
[44:35] we are getting this power right now
[44:38] every time we are feeding on the word
[44:41] the word is working in our life praise
[44:44] be to God that's why we encourage
[44:48] Believers to receive the Holy Ghost
[44:50] because the Holy Ghost is that
[44:53] resurrection power amen and when we have
[44:57] him in us we can speak like Jesus break
[45:01] this temple in 3 days I will build it
[45:05] praise be to God
[45:08] Amen if you read John chap 10:
[45:12] 17 and 18 let us go
[45:18] there St John chapter 10:
[45:22] 17 it says that
[45:25] uh therefore do my
[45:29] father love me because I lay down my
[45:33] life and I might take it
[45:37] again no man taketh it from me but I lay
[45:43] it down of myself and I have power to
[45:47] lay it down and I have power to take it
[45:51] again this commandment I have received
[45:55] of my father blessed be the name of the
[45:58] Lord Jesus was so sure about what he's
[46:01] talking about Jesus knew that he is that
[46:05] seed of woman who will braise the head
[46:07] of the serpent blessed be the name of
[46:09] the Lord Jesus knew that he was that
[46:12] incorruptable seed praise be to God that
[46:16] even when Jesus died on the third day
[46:19] the prophet tells us that corruption
[46:21] takes place on the fourth
[46:23] day but even death could not hold him
[46:26] captive blessed be the name of the Lord
[46:29] and that's why we sing and say even in
[46:31] the grave he is Lord praise be to God
[46:35] that is the God we are serving he is the
[46:37] Lord of our life he's the Lord of every
[46:40] situation he's the Lord of whatever we
[46:42] are going through is the Lord of your
[46:44] storm it's the Lord of your sickness
[46:47] praise be to God in each and every
[46:50] situation Jesus is Lord praise be to God
[46:55] David says in Psalms 16: 10 that for
[46:59] thou will not leave my soul in Hell
[47:02] neither will thou suffer thy Holy One to
[47:05] see
[47:07] corruption God revealed this thing to
[47:10] David and David saw Christ and here he
[47:14] says Thou will not leave my soul in Hell
[47:19] neither will thou suffer thy Holy One to
[47:22] see corruption blessed be the name of
[47:24] the Lord and the prophet in the message
[47:26] what is the Holy Ghost he says that what
[47:30] the holy spirit is is the Seal of
[47:33] God that you have found Grace in his
[47:38] sight and he loves you and he believes
[47:43] you and he puts his seal upon
[47:47] you and the Seal of God that is the
[47:50] power of the
[47:53] Resurrection praise be to God no matter
[47:57] how good we are no matter how nice we
[48:00] are how good church member we are but
[48:04] without that we have no Journey blessed
[48:07] be the name of the Lord and if there's
[48:09] something that somebody has to cry for
[48:12] is for the presence of God is for God to
[48:15] give us that new birth blessed be the
[48:18] name of the Lord because it is later
[48:20] than we think we must be sure that when
[48:23] I die maybe you may die in a car crash
[48:26] maybe you may be die of any kind of
[48:29] death but are you sure that you're are
[48:31] going to
[48:33] resurrect are you sure that you have
[48:35] that power that you have acquired that
[48:38] power of resurrection and the power of
[48:41] Resurrection is in Christ
[48:45] Jesus and when you have it brother you
[48:48] are sure praise be to God you see the
[48:51] good thing with the message it is not
[48:53] all about guess work we to be in our
[48:58] domination when you just think and
[49:00] presume that
[49:03] ah maybe because you sang in the spirit
[49:06] maybe because you spoke in tongues maybe
[49:08] because you pray for the sick and the
[49:10] sick get healed and you presume that ah
[49:13] everything is right but when you come
[49:15] this side it's different story why as
[49:18] John the Baptist was sent to forun my
[49:20] first coming your message will for on
[49:23] the second coming amen praise be to God
[49:29] so in this time round we have to be
[49:34] sure amen you must be
[49:37] sure because there is no any other
[49:40] message it is this message for running
[49:43] the second coming of
[49:45] Christ and that's why we believed
[49:48] it praise be to God and that's why we
[49:51] have a better understanding we know when
[49:55] we're talking about worship we know what
[49:57] we are talking about when we talking
[49:59] about Christianity we know what we're
[50:01] talking about when we talk about the
[50:03] Holy Spirit we know what we're talking
[50:06] about amen I remember when we were still
[50:09] in Pentecostal denomination at home when
[50:12] they start speaking in tongues you would
[50:14] think that what was
[50:16] happening my mom in tongues my brothers
[50:19] my cousins my
[50:21] unles but what's surprisingly when we
[50:25] when we we believe the message
[50:28] I wonder where the tongue disappeared
[50:32] from I think I've never I've never heard
[50:35] my mother speaking in tongues and she
[50:38] used to be the
[50:41] Pioneer praise be to
[50:44] God someone speaks in tongues until he
[50:48] suffocates and I was wondering what kind
[50:51] of tongue is this one but when the True
[50:54] Light Came in our family
[50:57] amen that disappeared praise be to God
[51:01] that today when someone is under
[51:03] anointing and speaks in tongues God
[51:06] comes and interprets
[51:08] it praise be to
[51:11] God Amen so we used to be threatened by
[51:15] those big men how dare you I'm a bishop
[51:19] I'm this and this but you
[51:21] come this side and see the different
[51:27] however big you are however great you
[51:30] are we have the waying the measuring
[51:34] stick is here blessed be the name of the
[51:36] Lord amen praise be to God so the
[51:40] prophet said that what the holy ghost
[51:42] that the holy spirit is the Seal of God
[51:45] that you have found Grace in the sight
[51:47] of
[51:48] God we ought to be sure that each one of
[51:52] us have found Grace in the sight of God
[51:55] not because we see sing and shout and
[51:58] cry and dance and jump and roll up and
[52:00] down you must be sure praise be to God
[52:04] because it's later than we think are you
[52:08] having that resurrection power in you
[52:11] praise be to God Amen because there is a
[52:15] man called Jesus Hallelujah who knows no
[52:19] Str praise be to God he cannot be
[52:22] threatened even by death and that Jesus
[52:25] want to Dell dwell in our soul praise be
[52:29] to God for the Bible says be holy for
[52:32] your father in Heaven is
[52:36] Holy it is only through Holiness that we
[52:40] can see
[52:43] God God only sees that token in our
[52:47] lives and that is the righteousness of
[52:50] God not the righteousness of
[52:52] denomination blessed be the name of the
[52:54] Lord Jesus amen Amen Hallelujah Jesus
[52:59] tells us
[53:01] hallelujah praise be to
[53:03] God that Jesus in Romans chap 1:
[53:07] 34:3 he say that Jesus Christ Our Lord
[53:10] was made of the seed of David according
[53:13] to the Flesh and declar to be the Son of
[53:17] God with power according to the spirit
[53:22] of
[53:24] Holiness amen by the resurrection from
[53:28] the
[53:32] dead Christ Our Lord was made of the
[53:35] seed of
[53:37] David according to the
[53:39] Flesh and declared to be the Son of God
[53:44] with
[53:45] power according to the spirit of
[53:49] Holiness by the resurrection from the
[53:53] dead blessed be the name of the Lord am
[53:57] amen
[53:59] friends there is a power of Resurrection
[54:02] in
[54:05] Christ and that is what we
[54:08] need praise be to God and because
[54:11] Apostle Paul knew that he had that power
[54:15] that's why when he reached his dying
[54:18] moment he said I have ran the race
[54:21] blessed be the name of the
[54:23] Lord amen when there was strike by
[54:26] Revelation and say that what shall
[54:29] separate us from the love of God which
[54:32] is in Christ Jesus the love of God is
[54:35] not in the things of the world the love
[54:38] of God is not in the things that we do
[54:40] but the love of God is in Christ Jesus
[54:44] amen when you have Jesus you have the
[54:47] love of God when you walk according the
[54:50] word of God we walk in the love of God
[54:53] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[54:57] praise be to
[54:59] God
[55:05] Amen in the message uh thou knowest all
[55:11] things butam say that Zoe zo means the
[55:15] life of
[55:16] God and you become an offspring of God
[55:21] and God can't hurt you without hurting
[55:24] himself
[55:26] blessed be the name of the
[55:32] Lord when we when we receive the spirit
[55:36] of Christ in
[55:39] us when we have that life that power of
[55:45] Resurrection because know it's only God
[55:47] who can resurrect blessed be the name of
[55:50] the Lord the prophet say that that is
[55:53] the life of God remember zo that's what
[55:56] came from God Amen praise be to God and
[56:00] that is the Son of
[56:03] God which means the life of God what
[56:08] makes us children of God is not this
[56:11] flesh but it is the life of God in us
[56:15] blessed be the name of the Lord that is
[56:18] the life of
[56:19] God and it says that the life of God
[56:22] that so it means the life of God and you
[56:25] become an old of God and God can't hurt
[56:28] you without hurting
[56:31] himself when he sees the blood he will
[56:34] pass over you why the blood was on the
[56:39] doorpost the blood had a voice the blood
[56:43] was the life amen and when the when the
[56:47] death angel when he was passing Egypt
[56:50] the blood was crying we are dead we are
[56:53] dead and that angel passed over them
[56:56] blessed be the name of the Lord because
[56:58] the life was in the blood amen and here
[57:03] he say that God cannot hurt himself if
[57:07] you have the spirit of Christ in you the
[57:11] prophet tells us you are already sealed
[57:14] good amen and that seal cannot be broken
[57:18] until you are day of your Redemption and
[57:21] that is the resurrection power I'm
[57:23] talking about blessed be the name of the
[57:25] Lord that when Jesus comes in us the
[57:28] Bible says that when the spirit that
[57:31] raised Christ from the dead there is a
[57:34] spirit that raised him from the dead
[57:37] amen that Spirit knows no law of
[57:41] gravity that's why when Jesus died
[57:44] Hallelujah he carried our sins praise be
[57:48] to God after he paid the dead we did not
[57:52] we he pay the debt we
[57:54] owe in fact the Dead Jesus
[57:57] Paid It Is Us who owed that
[58:00] de then he paid the debt we could not
[58:04] pay and when he died and buried there is
[58:08] a secret the spirit of Life praise be to
[58:12] God and that's why the bible say that
[58:15] when the spirit that raised Christ from
[58:16] the dead dwelleth in us what you need is
[58:20] that Spirit to dwell in you amen he will
[58:24] Quicken you m of body he will Quicken
[58:27] your weak body he will Quicken your weak
[58:30] Faith amen he will Quicken our children
[58:34] because he's the spirit of Life blessed
[58:38] be the name of the Lord that same spirit
[58:41] in Genesis chapter one The Bible says
[58:44] that the Earth was messed up amen but
[58:48] that same Spirit was brooding over the
[58:50] Earth
[58:52] Hallelujah and that same Spirit brought
[58:55] life
[58:57] blessed be the name of the Lord when the
[58:59] spirit comes upon us the commotion is
[59:02] settled blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:05] amen say that you stand un unadulterated
[59:08] a born again son and daughter of God
[59:11] with the life of God in you to speak the
[59:15] word blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:17] Jesus said that break this temple in 3
[59:22] days I will build
[59:24] it Jesus
[59:26] was the spoken word praise be to God he
[59:30] was it was the spoken word because
[59:34] remember that the angel spoke to Mary
[59:36] and Mary believed so Jesus knows the law
[59:40] which was operating within blessed be
[59:43] the name of the Lord
[59:45] amen he knows that even the power of
[59:48] gravity the force of gravity could not
[59:51] hold him praise be to God that's why
[59:54] when Jesus made the blind blind
[59:57] man you know how sensitive the eye
[1:00:01] is so this man was
[1:00:04] blind and I believe he needed an extra
[1:00:08] care when it comes to his eyes but what
[1:00:12] Jesus
[1:00:23] did blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:00:26] because he is the
[1:00:28] resurrection and life the first born of
[1:00:31] all the creation blessed be the name of
[1:00:34] the Lord so friends I want to introduce
[1:00:36] you that power blessed be the name of
[1:00:38] the Lord and that power is in the word
[1:00:41] hallelujah if you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:00:45] you have that power in you but if you
[1:00:47] die without the Holy Ghost you are lost
[1:00:51] praise be to
[1:00:54] God he
[1:00:56] amen without the Holy Ghost we are
[1:01:00] lost but because God loved us for God so
[1:01:03] love the world he said that when he the
[1:01:06] Holy Ghost will
[1:01:08] come he gave us the promise of the Holy
[1:01:10] Spirit praise be to God this body has it
[1:01:15] desire it has a lot of need and without
[1:01:18] the Holy Ghost amen we cannot manage it
[1:01:22] blessed be the name of the Lord but I
[1:01:24] want to tell you this after this evening
[1:01:26] that the power of Resurrection lies
[1:01:28] within the word of God Amen if you
[1:01:32] receive Jesus if you receive this word
[1:01:35] if you receive it and walk according to
[1:01:37] it amen and we go further from
[1:01:40] justification from sanctification until
[1:01:43] the B of the Holy Ghost then there we
[1:01:46] are having the power of
[1:01:49] Resurrection praise be to God that power
[1:01:53] does not only work within us but even
[1:01:57] within the creation praise be to
[1:02:01] God that's why you can pray for a tree
[1:02:05] and it get healed what is that it is the
[1:02:09] power of
[1:02:10] Resurrection amen that power lays within
[1:02:16] you that you can speak we have heard
[1:02:19] Pastor telling us how he SP to the rain
[1:02:22] that is the power of creation amen the
[1:02:26] Bible tells us go into the world and
[1:02:28] preach the whole gospel to Every
[1:02:29] Creature not only human
[1:02:33] being amen creatures have ears and they
[1:02:38] hear the word of God that's why one time
[1:02:42] the prophet was hunting and then the
[1:02:44] storm was coming he did not know praise
[1:02:47] be to God and when he saw the storm
[1:02:49] coming he started running for his life
[1:02:53] but the voice spoke and told him turn
[1:02:55] back back and speak to the storm what
[1:02:58] was that that was the power of
[1:03:01] Resurrection amen the prophet had that
[1:03:04] power to speak the
[1:03:06] creation blessed be the name of the
[1:03:10] Lord hallelujah that resurrection power
[1:03:14] is the righteousness of Christ in us and
[1:03:17] that's why Apostle Paul tells us it
[1:03:20] tells us in Philippians CH 3:9 that and
[1:03:23] be we found in him not having my own
[1:03:26] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:03:29] that which is through the Faith of
[1:03:31] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[1:03:35] by faith blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:03:49] amen praise the Lord in the message God
[1:03:52] hiding himself in Simplicity the prophet
[1:03:55] say that that you stand
[1:03:58] unadulterated a born son and daughter of
[1:04:01] God with the life of God in you to speak
[1:04:05] a word of creation let this mountain be
[1:04:10] moved and it will remind
[1:04:14] you praise be to
[1:04:17] God you remember in Job 14 where it says
[1:04:20] that if man die shall he live
[1:04:23] again and all the days of of my life
[1:04:26] appointed time will I wait till my
[1:04:30] change
[1:04:33] come
[1:04:35] Hallelujah for the corruptable must put
[1:04:38] on incorruption that is 1 Corinthians
[1:04:40] chapter 15 vers
[1:04:50] 53 praise be to
[1:04:54] God he amen and
[1:04:57] amen turn to me let's let's read Romans
[1:05:00] chapter
[1:05:01] 10: chapter 8 rather verses
[1:05:07] 10 to 11
[1:05:31] we can start from five say for they that
[1:05:33] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[1:05:36] of the flesh but they that are after the
[1:05:38] spirit the things of the spirit for to
[1:05:41] be caral minded is death but to be
[1:05:45] spiritual minded is life and
[1:05:48] peace because the kind of mind is
[1:05:51] enemity against God for it is is not
[1:05:57] subject to the law of God neither indeed
[1:06:01] can be
[1:06:05] amen so they that are in the flesh
[1:06:08] cannot please
[1:06:10] God but you are not in the flesh but in
[1:06:15] the spirit if so be that the spirit of
[1:06:17] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[1:06:21] the spirit of Christ is none of his as
[1:06:25] ask yourself do you have the spirit of
[1:06:28] Christ are you sure that you have the
[1:06:30] spirit of
[1:06:31] Christ he says you're none of his if you
[1:06:34] don't
[1:06:35] have Christ is putting
[1:06:38] emphasis Apostle Paul is putting
[1:06:41] emphasis
[1:06:42] here and is reminding the
[1:06:45] church
[1:06:47] amen that caral mind is enemity to God
[1:06:51] caral person will always think about
[1:06:53] caral things his conversation will be
[1:06:55] caral his sacrifice will be caral his
[1:06:59] prayer life will be carel amen
[1:07:03] everything he will do will be
[1:07:05] carel when a cause comes like maybe
[1:07:08] there arise a CA like maybe uh we want
[1:07:10] to get something it is kind of people
[1:07:13] who will complain
[1:07:14] fast every time you're making
[1:07:17] contribution every time this and that
[1:07:20] praise be to
[1:07:22] God and remember God hate maming
[1:07:26] the Wild and his fullness is of the Lord
[1:07:29] amen praise be to God it is our role to
[1:07:33] support the work of God and when we are
[1:07:36] walking in the spirit it will be light
[1:07:38] to us amen this will not be a burden
[1:07:43] that's why a kind of man cannot serve
[1:07:45] the Lord a can of man cannot praise
[1:07:48] cannot worship and a kind of man God
[1:07:51] will never accept his
[1:07:54] sacrifice praise to
[1:07:56] God so Apostle Paul is reminding us that
[1:08:00] a mind is an enemity to
[1:08:04] God praise be to God because God is
[1:08:08] spirit and those who worship Him will
[1:08:10] worship Him in spirit praise be to God
[1:08:13] but you are not in the flesh but in the
[1:08:17] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:08:21] dwells in you now if any man have know
[1:08:24] the spirit of Christ
[1:08:26] he is none of his and if Christ be in
[1:08:29] you the body is dead because of
[1:08:34] sin by the spirit is life because of
[1:08:38] righteousness blessed be the name of the
[1:08:40] Lord when the spirit of God is in us our
[1:08:44] body will have to die because our body
[1:08:47] will be operating under another law
[1:08:49] praise be to God and that's the law of
[1:08:52] life not the law of death praise be to
[1:08:55] to God
[1:08:57] Amen may God give us the spirit of
[1:09:00] Christ but if the spirit of Christ if
[1:09:03] the spirit of him that raises Christ
[1:09:06] from the dead dwelleth in you he that
[1:09:09] raised Christ up amen from the dead
[1:09:14] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:09:16] a spirit that dwelleth in you your
[1:09:19] mortal body cannot be quickened unless
[1:09:22] the spirit of Christ dwells in you
[1:09:26] praise be to God and these are things
[1:09:30] which sometime we take them for
[1:09:33] granted every Christian must be sure
[1:09:36] that the spirit of Christ dwells within
[1:09:39] us praise be to
[1:09:44] God when you don't have the spirit of
[1:09:47] Christ forget about
[1:09:50] Rapture praise be to
[1:09:54] God don't even call yourself
[1:09:59] worshipper because when you are
[1:10:00] worshiping God is not even looking I
[1:10:03] [Music]
[1:10:04] say praise be to
[1:10:12] God therefore brethren we are debors not
[1:10:16] to the flesh to live after the flesh for
[1:10:20] if you live after the flesh you shall
[1:10:23] die but if you if you
[1:10:26] through the spirit of the spirit do
[1:10:29] notify the Deeds of the body you shall
[1:10:33] live for as many as led by the spirit of
[1:10:35] God they are sons of God praise be to
[1:10:39] God
[1:10:41] Amen praise the Lord
[1:10:56] so also is there the resurrection of the
[1:10:58] Dead in uh 1 Corinthians
[1:11:01] 15 uh 42 verse 4 says so
[1:11:06] also is the resurrection of the dead it
[1:11:09] is sown in corruption it is raised in
[1:11:13] incorruption and the message the token
[1:11:15] the prophets tells us that you must
[1:11:17] present the token that you are subject
[1:11:20] for the resurrection you see because the
[1:11:23] resurrecting power is is already in
[1:11:27] you do you believe that that the
[1:11:30] resurrect power is already in
[1:11:33] you present the token then you are the
[1:11:37] subject for the
[1:11:40] Resurrection The Token is the
[1:11:42] resurrection
[1:11:44] power and all of us we know the token
[1:11:46] what is the token the token is the Holy
[1:11:48] Ghost and if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:11:51] that is the resurrection power praise be
[1:11:53] to God and Jesus when he was being
[1:11:55] baptized the Bible says Heaven opens
[1:11:59] amen and the voice spoke this is my
[1:12:02] beloved Son whom I'm well pleased to
[1:12:05] dwell in he in him amen and because
[1:12:09] Jesus the Holy Ghost was dwelling in him
[1:12:12] God himself incarnate in flesh was
[1:12:15] dwelling in Christ that's why Jesus said
[1:12:18] put this Temple down I will raise it up
[1:12:21] in 3 days praise be to God and that's
[1:12:24] why when he had about Lazarus death that
[1:12:27] was just a minor
[1:12:30] thing he said let us go and resurrect
[1:12:33] him because himself was
[1:12:36] resurrection and when Jesus reached
[1:12:39] there and Martha came and said I know he
[1:12:42] will rise in the last day Jesus asked
[1:12:45] them for the grave blessed be the name
[1:12:47] of the Lord and that's why Jesus never
[1:12:51] attended funerals amen because when Jes
[1:12:55] Jesus comes to your funeral you just
[1:12:57] know their Resurrection is going to take
[1:13:01] over praise be to God Amen Jesus is life
[1:13:08] when Jesus meets death something happen
[1:13:12] praise be to God and what we want
[1:13:15] tonight we want Jesus in our dead
[1:13:17] condition because he is the resurrection
[1:13:20] he is that resurrecting power praise be
[1:13:23] to God when he comes and meet our dead
[1:13:26] condition it is going to resurrect am
[1:13:29] because Jesus is that resurrecting
[1:13:33] power what the church need tonight is
[1:13:37] Jesus in our lives not only in our
[1:13:42] mids Jesus in our midst and Jesus in in
[1:13:45] US those are two different
[1:13:48] things you need Jesus inside you you
[1:13:52] need Jesus in your soul
[1:13:56] let that anointing comes inside of you
[1:13:59] out let that praise come inside of you
[1:14:02] out because Jesus is in your heart
[1:14:06] blessed be the name of the Lord the
[1:14:08] prophet tells us that no man had ever
[1:14:10] spoken like that that I can lay down my
[1:14:13] life and bring it up Talk of the great
[1:14:15] mens of the world we have had them all
[1:14:17] over we have read about them amen but
[1:14:22] when they died that marked their end but
[1:14:25] when Jesus died even
[1:14:28] today there is an imput grave proving
[1:14:32] that he is resurrection and life blessed
[1:14:35] be the name of the Lord so let us
[1:14:38] present that token praise the Lord in
[1:14:41] the message ister s the prophet say that
[1:14:43] we are you are creature with the
[1:14:46] resurrection power within
[1:14:49] us so the
[1:14:51] church is in it is complete
[1:14:59] maturity in it complete
[1:15:02] maturity if you look at when we believed
[1:15:05] and where we are today there are many
[1:15:08] years praise be to God just imagine the
[1:15:12] seed was planted 20 years ago do you
[1:15:14] think that seed is still in the
[1:15:18] ground it germinated it has been growing
[1:15:21] amen we are approaching the coming of
[1:15:24] the Lord
[1:15:25] we are living in the Harvest Time praise
[1:15:28] be to God and what we are seeing in the
[1:15:31] Pentecostal that is the seed which was
[1:15:34] planted we are now seeing the fruits
[1:15:36] they are bearing they cannot bear
[1:15:38] something much better than that amen
[1:15:41] because that was the seed which was
[1:15:43] planted in the beginning praise be to
[1:15:46] God don't expect them to get better they
[1:15:49] will get worse and
[1:15:51] worse because that is the seed praise be
[1:15:55] to
[1:15:57] God and the prophet tells us the seed
[1:15:59] shall not inherit with a
[1:16:03] Shar so we are living in the Harvest
[1:16:09] Time this when we are seeing the true
[1:16:12] seed which was planted in the beginning
[1:16:14] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:16:19] amen praise the
[1:16:23] Lord the power of of Resurrection is in
[1:16:27] Christ and that power is in the
[1:16:30] church because Jesus said whatever was
[1:16:33] in whatever was in father he poured it
[1:16:37] in Christ and whatever was in
[1:16:40] Christ every Miracle every Divine
[1:16:43] Healing every Power every uh
[1:16:47] righteousness which was in Christ Jesus
[1:16:50] he has poured it in the church and you
[1:16:54] are in that you are that church not in
[1:16:57] this building no sir you are in that
[1:17:00] church you are that church amen Christ
[1:17:03] has poured it in you that's why most
[1:17:06] time ministers are preaching reminding
[1:17:10] us about our inheritance that is our
[1:17:13] inheritance praise be to God you must
[1:17:17] have your inheritance we must know our
[1:17:20] inheritance first amen that you inherit
[1:17:24] the Holy
[1:17:27] Ghost and the Holy Spirit is the power
[1:17:29] to live Christian Life praise be to God
[1:17:33] is the power of Resurrection it's the
[1:17:36] power of rapture it's the power of
[1:17:38] worship
[1:17:41] amen praise be to
[1:17:44] God and when
[1:17:47] Jesus told them show me the
[1:17:50] grave he was resurrection and he is
[1:17:53] resurrection even
[1:17:55] today and he is life blessed be the name
[1:17:59] of the
[1:18:00] Lord
[1:18:03] amen in Romans chapter 8 verse1
[1:18:07] 17 he said that if children then the
[1:18:10] hairs the hairs of God and Joint hairs
[1:18:13] with Christ do you believe that that we
[1:18:16] are the hairs of God and the joint hair
[1:18:19] with
[1:18:20] Christ
[1:18:23] amen and the prophet in the message uh
[1:18:26] the Lan Church age he says that with the
[1:18:29] resur with the restoration of the power
[1:18:32] with with the resurrection of the word
[1:18:34] will come the resurrection of the power
[1:18:40] amen and it says that perfect faith is
[1:18:43] the master of all
[1:18:45] circumstances perfect Faith Masters all
[1:18:48] circumstances no matter what it is it
[1:18:52] Masters
[1:18:53] it amen
[1:18:55] amen and he said that oh Lord send the
[1:18:58] Holy Ghost just now somehow into this
[1:19:01] resurrection and may they rise to their
[1:19:04] feet in the resurrection power and be
[1:19:08] identified with Christ in his
[1:19:10] resurrection Amen in the message Paradox
[1:19:13] the prophet says we pray father that you
[1:19:15] will send down Grace in the resurrection
[1:19:19] power of Christ that you might restore
[1:19:23] resurrect us to a Living Faith in the
[1:19:26] word of this day and I believe that is
[1:19:31] what the church need and I believe
[1:19:33] that's why God sent this message to
[1:19:36] resurrect us to the power of Christ that
[1:19:41] he might
[1:19:42] restore resurrect us to a living faith
[1:19:46] in the Living Word of this day blessed
[1:19:51] be the name of the Lord amen shall We

[1:26:43] the tree uh it was very very amazing and
[1:26:47] uh we preached this message without fear
[1:26:49] or
[1:26:50] favor and five Souls we are ready to be
[1:26:53] baptized by the time we fin finished so
[1:26:55] I thought that was a very wonderful
[1:26:56] thing so the the one of the brothers of
[1:26:59] sister Lilian and a few others they said
[1:27:02] now there must be a church in this place
[1:27:05] so there is no church in that area uh
[1:27:08] but we believe that a church is going to
[1:27:10] begin in that in that place in the name
[1:27:12] of Jesus Christ so already we have uh
[1:27:15] the sister of haret is also I mean the
[1:27:16] sister of Leen who is AR yet she's also
[1:27:19] uh a Believer but she wasn't
[1:27:22] fellowshipping for a long long time so
[1:27:24] now some of our children also were part
[1:27:26] of those that believed and a few others
[1:27:29] are going to be believing we had pastor
[1:27:32] Pastor obia jofre also from L who
[1:27:34] escorted us there and he was
[1:27:35] interpreting interpreting in langi so uh
[1:27:38] it was a very good time we had a good
[1:27:40] time so we also introduced him to them
[1:27:43] uh we hope by the grace of God we shall
[1:27:45] keep going back to help them and by the
[1:27:48] obia will also be coming to help them so
[1:27:50] let us remember that family and that
[1:27:52] area of Lord Ro in prayer you know this
[1:27:56] message must move and we are the ones
[1:27:59] going to move
[1:28:00] it God is going to use us Amen Let us
