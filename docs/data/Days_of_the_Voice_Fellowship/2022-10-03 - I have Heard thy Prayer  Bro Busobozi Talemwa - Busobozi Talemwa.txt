========================================

second team second Kings chapter 20 verses 1. and we are going to read from one to seven I trust that you have your Bible and that you're opening it is [Music] [Music] I'm speaking to you this morning on a very important subject is second Kings chapter 20 from verse in those days was Hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet Isaiah the son of Moses came to him and said unto him thus saith the Lord set the in-house in order for Thou shalt die and not leave then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech thee O Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with the perfect with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah whip so and it came to pass before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the Lord came unto him saying turn again until Hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have seen the tears behold I will heal thee on the third day Thou shalt go up into unto the house of the Lord and I will add unto thy days 15 years and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Prayer and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David is sake and Isaiah said take alarm or fix and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered is um foreign [Music] foreign amen Lord Jesus look at my ears we object and a portion of scripture we are breaded as men but we ask for inspiration from Europe not come here to see one another I have not even come here to talk to these people of my own language I need you Lord to give me utterance Use Me Lord because the sun will come up and may you put bind us all together in the same spirit this morning that your word will have free points praise the Lord praise the Lord come and give us the way as usual I want to request for your undivided attention and try to limit movement as much as you can plus that your Pawn is in silence so that you can be here a hundred percent praise the Lord I want you to look at that you know how many I've ever read this portion of scriptures okay what about those who have never heard of this portion of church and so I want to believe that we are all Christians and so um here was a man a man who whose days had come to an end and God now sent a prophet to him and you know God is always in the business of sending prophets Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he never changes so if he did send prophets once you will always send foreign men believe in prayer great women have been women of prayer and if you want to be great in this life you must be a man a woman of prayer if you are not a prayerful man or woman you are not great but if you are a prayerful man or woman you are a great man or a great woman and so this was a king and with all that he had done for the Lord suffering and affliction and I want to say that suffering and afflictions are a part of our Christian journey and many times we are in need [Music] times it might sound strange but it is not strange one point in your life [Music] you know once always for us to keep focused on those things the devil's plan is to allow you to focus on those things and God will not take them away he will not take away those things a Christian suffers Affliction and we went through that sometime back and you're driving that every Christian in this world at one point will suffer Affliction how men have ever been in need I'm not speaking something strange I'm talking about our everyday life yes how many have ever wanted to have something how many have ever been desperate you know in every continent there is a problem that is prevalents to the Western World you find a lot of natural disasters and a lot of sickness well now you you find that you will they will get Wildfire back to normal and people will lose their property foreign [Music] here in Uganda there has been some sort of lack of food and people go with it with empty stomachs we have also lack of money you find everybody's eyes open trying to see where can they get money people don't come to church because they're trying money people snacks people's phones because they want to save the money so really you know there is problems everywhere like I said here in Africa our greatest physical problem is lack of that's why people become you know they become hard-hearted you know people don't go to churches anymore even when they do they have a form of godliness you have also seen many fresh pastors of us is to try and make some money for themselves they just go there and do some comedy because I knew that people usually are calling for I don't know why over around 20 minutes you know they just deceived in people are and oh they just go and take the money when the man of God tells them look I want you you know I I want to show you something here you know they play their games the lame person many times it is already a false Ministry [Music] true Ministry is usually settled on Christ or where is our emphasis is not a man a man our emphasis is not our Bishop Community this is on Jesus Christ that's the purpose why we are Christians because they want money and they will get this money and they will try to go marry second wife and I will go abroad by Mansions they will drive cars which look like people never foreign [Music] see no more academic but you know when Jesus came in I think it was Simon's house you know they never washed his feet they never they never cleaned him up he never gave him a good seat and they simply told him they just looked at him and he walked in and went to a park a seat nobody attended to him let me tell you that is the the the condition of the churches of Our Generation they have invited Jesus to come in their churches yes they have not attended to him how have they not attended to him by not hearing the word I'm not preaching the word what makes them accepted is not the word foreign foreign foreign praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen I am not standing here to entertain you see me I'm standing here in the name of the Lord give you the word of God give you the mind of God I am not giving you the word of God they can now says my son I'm not the one talking now demons have come on now I'm prophesied What About Us by the way right in our Amina everything can failure is the word of God they are never says you're overcoming your enemies bear is a weapon but any believer can use and praise God it works out how many can shout and say it works you can never be spiritual not to pray because foreign if you don't pray you are not a Christian foreign prayer is the only communication medium between God and Men amen I want you to see this in a message Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever said well I believe some places the some place the Bible says when the weakest of saints God to their needs Titania kankana but what a woman not the powerful one who is weak here when you go to your neighbors never begins why why because they know the outcome of that is when you go to your knees are in problems what a powerful and a privilege had been given to the church I mean when you fall to your knees in a prayer Masala even the devil's tremble name is Simone to the weakest of Christians you don't have to be powerful man you don't have to know how to speak in Italian you don't need to be spiritual to be a sinner you only need to believe in God you believe in Jesus baby [Applause] [Music] God answers Ephesians chapter 6 verse 18. brother praying always with all prayer and you need to be very fast right so he says praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching the country with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints we are reading Ephesians 6 18. this is [Music] sometimes um amen I mean is it a man he said praying always somebody praying always pray praying always with all prayer no and supplication in the spirit listen church prayer is not simply opening your mother say hello Jesus thank you foreign [Music] I woke up if you you if you cannot shut tears in prayer you have not prayed letters [Music] am I speaking to someone here if you think you're a prayer warriors that is just a speech God is not calling for a speech God is calling for prayer and I'll prove everything I'm saying by the Bible in James 4 7 it says resist the devil and he will flee for me how do you resistance Hallelujah when you take your knee watches you that's why the devil always fights seriously I wanna he doesn't want you to go to your knees when you're about to go there bring something by now I need to sleep and now after you've done everything then the baby cries you're the man said I have to go to work I have to do this you may never find time to pray foreign [Applause] um yes sir I mean praise the name of the Lord believe in God 1953 he says that is the reasons foreign [Applause] The Authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon is [Music] the most powerful weapon is [Applause] it even changes everything my goodness it will change the mind of God oh Christ after death was pronounced foreign [Applause] [Applause] so if is that powerful that is [Music] my we do not realize how great it is we don't really realize how great prayer is there is no prayer that is foreign hallelujah amen God answers prayer I'll I'll show you an example here let us go to the book of Acts chapter 12. it's a little long reading but it's very powerful for us and I wanted to go through it you can open there open there with me and let us read slowly your brother put the cross on the screen up I was kept in prison kept in prison I prepared this before but Solomon was in prisoners kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church God for him and when he wrote a Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with the two chains and they keep us before the Torah kept the prison saying [Applause] foreign and raised him up saying hallelujah hallelujah Peter was just there brother can you come up here it's just down kneeling down and his hands were born together is this magic oh my goodness because prayer involves the greatest power in heaven on Earth from his hands on thy sandals foreign vision soon [Music] and the second word they came up and I get the leaders under the city which opened to them of his own accord and went out and passed on through one street and fought with the angel departed from him I don't care who has crossed the guests things like that let me tell you in the name of the Lord expectations Hallelujah listen and when he had to considered the thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was back we have made me gathered together everybody right now [Music] yes and as Peter not at the door of the gate Adams came to take a named water and when Road knew Peter's voice she did not open the gate because of joy and gladness and so she read and told how Peter stood before the gate and they said unto her uh oh my goodness but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then they say that it is the it is when they had opened the door and they saw him they were astonished Hallelujah man Hallelujah church I said I said Hallelujah Peter was kept in prison but prayer was bad without by believer who believed in prayer they come together they say let us pray for me now that we are together for anyone it was not a one person we are now together imagine if the weakest of Christians what about if they're more weak Christians uh say what what year um you are weak I understand you may be weak no problems oh my goodness another sister it was supplication oh my God I don't know oh my God oh my God everybody [Applause] foreign come on get into the description and he went out and followed him and wished not that it was true which was done by the angel that thought that but thought he was he saw a vision foreign [Music] that could not stand before a man that is Amen in front of prayer no John Wayne Hallelujah my goodness I just feel like speaking in tongues because he was great there were great prayers foreign [Applause] foreign that man was left outside with when you when they get is closed my brother continue on I said go on we're hungry humans press on don't give up black secretary what do you think he was doing they called they said he had a witchcraft [Music] yeah and do you know what happened the gate said okay you can call me it gets open and I believe the gods were surprised they said this man is a witch how can he come in just like that who even opened for him foreign [Music] foreign you have a powerful weapon or the natural Quran is dynamic use it everywhere you go and submit your application after that don't just go there I did it very well I'll be giving the joke Hallelujah they would think you are crazy but brother prayer answers hit them so it is [Music] Amina research the Angels appears were never there is a prayer family the angels are ministering Spirits from Before the Throne of God and whenever you pray God is constrained I don't understand don't ask all Angels prayers who don't believe that we have access to God speak to God you are not that you are sinner you cannot speak to God the final name of someone who died and is rotten in hell then you have to pray through them all foreign foreign the ones who go to heaven die when they are saying [Music] and here the Bible says Peter was in prison the Saints we are praying that's what the Bible says the ones we are praying we are Saints I have say it's here today if you believe jealous if you believe Jesus as your personal savior in his name nobody is answer The Monuments you accept this serving Grace foreign they will find a joy foreign foreign are you and Maryam is in heaven now Hallelujah in heaven I will meet Peter yeah I must say it because if you want engines to appeared and it's an angel sent down from heaven and if you don't believe in angels and if you don't believe Angel's administering spirits sent from the presence of God then you don't know the Bible is angels and ministers have you ever seen engines then you need to do this if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God of the things of the world go about your business go to your church whatever you are you're not going to keep your mind on him all day and all night long the ones I am is foreign ah foreign [Music] foreign you know foreign foreign yeah you know yeah it's like I'm here in Kansas you are the only one I have been okay so when I'm hearing such songs foreign you're not supposed to listen to the word songs of the world already now worried I mean the angels will never appear to you on what crowns because you know me when I hear Michael Jackson Michael Jackson it puts me in the spirit because the boys you know when he breaks himself wear a

saw a vision if you pray God will say I have had thy prayer I will send Angel to lead you out of your prison Hallelujah who [Music] to the extent you will think that you are seeing a vision ever prayed it's my audience foreign foreign [Music] with him they are not ashamed they must swallow older yeah with a supernatural to the extent you think it's a vision he will do things for you that you
