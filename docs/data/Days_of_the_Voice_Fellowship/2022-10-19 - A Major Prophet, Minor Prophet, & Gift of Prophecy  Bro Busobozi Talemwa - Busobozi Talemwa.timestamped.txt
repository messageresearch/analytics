[4:39] almost the smaller book
[4:42] I'm gonna see
[4:45] around after it's okay
[4:53] I must get
[4:57] this concerning
[5:06] signing the pattern of God that's what
[5:08] we want us yeah
[5:16] agree
[5:20] I must see is
[5:24] for the sake of our reading tonight we
[5:26] shall just read verse 7 and visit yeah
[5:35] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[5:38] he revealed his secret unto his servants
[5:40] the prophets
[5:51] amen Amina Lord Jesus we permit this
[5:55] scripture that we have read the
[5:57] preaching over tonight
[6:12] we go into a little bible study tonight
[6:21] for each and every one of us here
[6:35] we may visit
[6:41] so I will just I want to greet you all
[6:44] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[6:52] of marriage tonight
[6:54] and so I I have a lot to cover and I'll
[6:58] just go straight into the scripture
[7:03] I'm requesting the people decide if you
[7:06] can check this site for at least 30
[7:09] minutes
[7:14] amen Amina
[7:20] and so tonight I'm going to speak on a
[7:22] Major Prophets
[7:33] and a gift of prophets
[7:35] did you hear that
[7:42] I don't know I don't know
[7:57] okay we will understand as we go along
[8:01] I know someone is
[8:06] so there are many interpretations to eat
[8:09] but uh I like Brother Martin said we
[8:13] want to look at a major prophet or a
[8:15] prophet of the age
[8:16] why are you kidding the drugs
[8:26] not explain it yet because that would be
[8:30] wrong in Spanish I'm just a prophet
[8:34] that is better I'm a gift to Professor
[8:38] would not be the prophetic or prophecy
[8:42] is a wonderful thing to the church a
[8:44] wonderful gift to the church in general
[8:50] and brother Ken
[8:54] spoken spoke about a voice
[8:59] and he he spoke about the the voice of
[9:04] the Prophet
[9:07] that we should hear the voice
[9:13] whenever God sends a prophet he expects
[9:16] us to hear his voice
[9:22] has been used and misused in our
[9:25] generation that we do not uh understand
[9:28] its meaning anymore
[9:30] [Music]
[9:44] they do not want to hear it
[9:47] because to them a prophet is somebody
[9:50] who deceives others and takes their
[9:52] money in the name of speaking in the
[9:55] name of the Lord
[9:57] [Music]
[10:02] especially in our generation
[10:05] and also here in Uganda
[10:08] Uganda we have a lot of people calling
[10:10] themselves prophets
[10:12] and others even call themselves Major
[10:14] Prophets
[10:16] and so then you do not understand but I
[10:19] want us to look at this in a scriptural
[10:21] point of view
[10:26] does God still use prophets
[10:34] that's prophecy still happened today
[10:37] what is prophecy anyway
[10:40] but I would like us to see that in the
[10:43] Book of Amos he begins by saying surely
[10:45] the Lord God will do nothing but he
[10:47] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[10:50] the prophets
[10:59] so now in every generation and I would
[11:02] like you to follow me closely
[11:04] because you will be doing some quotes
[11:07] and scriptures
[11:10] on Wednesday we usually have a Bible
[11:12] study whatever you want to call it but I
[11:15] hope that we all have our spiritual
[11:18] antennas tuned tonight
[11:25] amen are you all right brother amen
[11:28] foreign
[11:57] [Music]
[12:20] they reached that time and they wanted
[12:23] that King like the people of the land
[12:26] the promised land what were they said
[12:32] and they said we want a king to rule us
[12:35] just like in other kingdoms
[12:40] initially the plan and the pattern of
[12:42] God was to lead his people by a prophet
[12:45] is
[12:54] a prophet whatever you want to call it a
[12:57] prophet is a compound word one argument
[13:00] [Music]
[13:03] just like sanctification is a compound
[13:05] word
[13:08] it means cleaned and set aside
[13:14] and so there's many words and especially
[13:16] in English the words that are compounds
[13:28] [Music]
[14:15] so you see that is and the inspiration
[14:20] but also a
[14:22] prophecy could mean or a prophet is
[14:25] somebody that foresee something
[14:30] and also in another message here the
[14:33] identification of Christ in all ages
[14:37] he says in the beginning he spoke to the
[14:40] prophets and the word of the Lord came
[14:42] to the prophets
[14:47] and the prophet being able to foretell
[14:49] Divine things and it happened just like
[14:52] that was his identification
[15:04] means one who forth tells or Tales forth
[15:08] is
[15:13] a Divine interpreter of the written word
[15:21] anybody knows anybody that knows that
[15:24] knows what a prophet means
[15:29] now the English word Prophet is
[15:37] just anybody preaching
[15:40] is
[15:46] which was referred to as a prophet
[15:50] he was the one that forced things
[15:55] he said if there be one among you who is
[15:58] spiritual or a prophet I the Lord will
[16:01] make myself known unto him
[16:06] and what he says
[16:10] shall come to pass and what it says if
[16:13] it comes to pass then hear him
[16:18] actually in the Old Testament if
[16:20] somebody came up and said I am a prophet
[16:22] and I'm not and I'm speaking in the name
[16:24] of the Lord and he said something and it
[16:26] never came to pass they stunned him to
[16:28] death
[16:34] because the prophet had to be Asia
[16:41] the word of the Lord came to him
[16:45] a lot of what he said was touted or
[16:48] supposed to be doubted
[16:51] everything he said was that say it alone
[17:24] [Music]
[17:29] is born in the world
[17:32] he is ordained for ordained of God to do
[17:35] that
[17:40] because gifts and callings are without
[17:42] repentance
[17:48] how we are going to look and address
[17:50] this tonight
[17:53] we are going to cut it into three phases
[18:00] first of all look at our prophet
[18:03] then we look at a minor prophet and then
[18:05] we look at the gift of prophets
[18:15] then we see the differences and what
[18:17] works when and what we have in our
[18:19] generation and what we must have in our
[18:21] time
[18:27] how can I expect them tonight
[18:30] hey man this is a good subject for us as
[18:33] Believers of the message to look at
[18:36] foreign
[19:01] [Music]
[19:19] [Music]
[19:36] foreign
[20:54] foreign
[20:55] [Music]
[21:00] [Applause]
[21:06] [Applause]
[21:11] [Music]
[21:54] that Jesus there is no profit
[22:00] but the Bible I read tells me now
[22:04] that our God is the same and he never
[22:06] changes
[22:08] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[22:11] and forever
[22:14] the god of the Jehovah of the Old
[22:16] Testament again is the Jesus of the new
[22:19] yes
[22:24] and he will do tomorrow
[22:26] if we use the prophet
[22:29] he will always use
[22:32] because whatever he thinks is perfect
[22:35] the first time he thought it was
[22:47] that's why the Bible the Bible does not
[22:50] have another Edition
[22:54] the Bible is there is the one true word
[22:57] of God
[22:59] people can write many versions of it
[23:04] according to their understanding
[23:08] of this Bible is one it's the word of
[23:12] God that does not change
[23:15] whatever it requires
[23:19] today
[23:21] so we see that God uses Major Prophets
[23:28] there is a Moses
[23:36] Jeremiah
[23:39] Elijah you can go on and on
[23:42] are you and these were all prophets in
[23:44] our generation
[23:46] but God did not use a Daniel and an
[23:50] Isaiah in the same generation
[23:54] he did not use a Samuel and a Moses at
[23:58] the same time
[24:01] in one generation
[24:59] you know what the other people are
[25:01] saying
[25:04] it's not popular opinion
[25:21] [Music]
[26:06] with one one purpose
[26:15] I noticed if you we can look at one by
[26:19] one anybody
[26:22] tried to run away from that calling oh
[26:24] we'll do your name
[26:31] and even after that they had to go until
[26:34] uh
[26:37] because they were born prophets
[26:43] Anointed with the spirit of prophet
[26:47] they were born to prophesy
[26:50] speak the word of God
[27:51] it is
[27:54] foreign
[27:59] [Applause]
[28:21] he couldn't help being a Moses
[28:29] God sent him down and gave him life on
[28:33] Earth
[28:35] and all the Pharaohs in the world
[28:37] couldn't have killed him anymore
[28:47] and whenever God sends this man
[28:53] when their work is
[28:58] no matter how they die
[29:08] he gave his message his voice was the
[29:12] voice of God
[29:14] when the man
[29:17] you know what happened
[29:19] they killed him
[29:21] foreign
[31:03] are you here guys people say
[31:07] oh so and so was not a prophet because
[31:11] of the way they died
[31:13] that is not how you vindicate a prophet
[31:17] you must know your Bible or you don't
[31:20] manage people to you
[31:21] hallelujah amen Jeremiah chapter one you
[31:26] know Jeremiah was one of the Major
[31:27] Prophets
[31:30] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[31:35] this is
[31:52] hallelujah amen the prophets did not
[31:55] need the ordination of the council
[31:59] the process did not need you know the
[32:02] crowning of the society or the
[32:04] denominations
[32:21] foreign
[32:51] unto thee a prophet from the midst of
[32:54] thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto
[32:58] him
[33:06] um
[33:25] [Applause]
[33:36] hmm
[33:37] remember that God told Moses
[33:40] he will not be only a prophet with them
[33:43] but you will be gone
[33:47] and so he was a prophet
[33:49] god cartoon
[33:52] and now here he was giving a Prophets
[33:55] The Lord God will raise up another
[33:59] Prophet gods of your medicine
[34:40] they come to us
[34:44] and when he came in John 14 11 he said
[34:46] believe that I am in the father
[34:55] else believe me for the very Works
[35:00] did you see how Vindicated how prophets
[35:04] have Vindicated
[35:09] [Applause]
[35:19] Hallelujah Amina
[35:21] I need to try to show them he was the
[35:25] god yeah but again he told them he was
[35:29] the son of mine
[35:30] he was mine too so what was he trying to
[35:34] say yeah
[35:43] but did they understand did they believe
[35:46] it but they did not understand it again
[35:49] they did not understand him in the Book
[35:53] of John chapter one
[35:59] but his own received him
[36:02] but to as many as received here
[36:12] hallelujah
[36:14] [Applause]
[36:16] at least if you can't believe what I'm
[36:18] saying
[36:20] let me show you
[36:27] you know
[36:30] Hallelujah man a prophet a true prophet
[36:33] of God
[36:36] comes to fulfill that which was written
[36:38] of him
[36:46] and that's the Vindication
[36:54] identify him
[36:59] I mean Hallelujah
[37:03] Matthew 11 2.
[37:07] now when John had her
[37:10] yeah when Jonah
[37:15] because I wanted to get it in the Bible
[37:17] have a very big Bible in in in your in
[37:21] your place it says Matthew 11 2 says now
[37:24] when John had heard in the prison The
[37:27] Works of Christ he sent two of his
[37:29] disciples and said unto him after thou
[37:32] he that should come oh do we look for
[37:35] another
[37:36] Jesus answered and said unto them go and
[37:39] show John again those things which ye do
[37:42] here and see
[37:45] yes
[37:56] [Music]
[38:07] find receive their site
[38:09] [Music]
[38:19] the poor have the gospel preached to
[38:22] them
[38:26] and blessed is he
[38:28] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[38:35] what did the scripture say that when the
[38:38] Messiah comes
[38:43] if you know your Bible very well
[38:47] in the book of Isaiah chapter 61.
[38:51] we will not stand there but you can read
[38:53] it later
[38:54] he says
[39:05] you know and he talked about setting
[39:07] free the captions
[39:09] it talks about you know uh you know
[39:13] giving the sight to the Blind
[39:16] and now hear Jesus when when John was in
[39:20] the prison
[39:23] he sent the people to go and ask whether
[39:25] Jesus was that Prophet which he expected
[39:29] to come yeah
[39:33] I wanted to really think about this for
[39:36] a moment
[39:40] a man who declared that this is Jesus
[39:51] and he's telling his followers
[39:58] but just go and ask him directly
[40:01] [Music]
[40:02] it seems as though he has now become
[40:05] like a Pharisee
[40:10] because he had things that made him
[40:12] doubt it was
[40:14] if he was the one how come I'm in prison
[40:20] can you let me try here
[40:23] I believe if the Messiah was to come the
[40:26] Messiah would would open the prison to
[40:29] those who are in prison he would he
[40:30] would set them free
[40:32] [Music]
[40:37] how can I be in prison
[40:42] go and find out boys
[40:52] that I announced to the people
[40:55] so that if it's not the right one then I
[40:58] can apologize I've given a public
[40:59] apology
[41:20] [Music]
[42:03] [Music]
[42:06] foreign
[42:25] [Music]
[43:17] foreign
[43:45] [Applause]
[44:12] we must manifest Christ to renew God
[44:14] exactly we must bring forth his nature
[44:16] his life
[44:19] praise the name of the Lord
[44:22] and Jesus was standing there yes
[44:30] he went to the lamb prayed for
[44:32] themselves
[44:50] foreign
[45:06] called himself Elijah Williams
[45:12] show me any Scripture where William run
[45:13] up or in a court because all the
[45:16] messages of William Panama are recorded
[45:20] foreign foreign
[45:32] [Music]
[45:48] [Music]
[46:16] the only way to vindicate a major
[46:18] prophet is whether or not he fulfills
[46:21] what is written of him
[46:29] let me ask you a question
[46:31] how many of you were in the
[46:33] denominations
[46:36] hallelujah
[46:45] amen there is
[47:09] too late
[47:47] the word of God comes to him
[47:50] there are repercussions if you do not
[47:53] listen to him
[47:56] but before God does anything in a
[47:58] generation
[48:19] does it mean that because there is a
[48:22] major prophet in our generation God does
[48:24] not use others as prophets
[48:34] in the message proving is what it says
[48:36] to watch when they go to
[48:40] Kardashians
[48:44] sent out one of the of each tribes
[48:51] to go spy out the land
[48:54] see which way they was to enter
[48:59] foreign
[49:29] Honda
[49:57] during the time
[50:00] even if it did
[50:03] it's not recorded
[50:05] what is important is the message of the
[50:08] major prophet
[50:12] the message of the Minor Prophets
[50:15] to individuals
[50:22] certain things
[50:26] but the message of the major prophet
[50:30] is a message to the whole world
[50:36] the whole world the whole world has to
[50:39] hear that message
[50:41] the whole world has to believe
[50:43] and if they don't believe it there is
[50:46] repercussions
[50:57] whether the others don't even get to
[50:59] hear about it it doesn't matter
[51:08] maybe God can use me or God can use
[51:11] somebody else to give a message to
[51:13] Uganda
[51:16] Uganda such and such will happen
[51:19] they don't even need to be Believers of
[51:21] the message
[51:24] gifts and callings of God without
[51:26] repentance
[51:29] and so don't think that this idea of
[51:31] prophets is is supposed to be those in
[51:34] your circles or those that believe what
[51:36] you believe
[51:41] that's why many people did not believe
[51:43] William Brothers
[52:03] the Oneness we are saying the Oneness we
[52:07] are saying
[52:09] are you one of us really
[52:11] if you're one of us what are you doing
[52:22] we have accepted you as a prophet of God
[52:24] choice
[52:54] that both of you are wrong
[52:57] and I am right
[53:02] beside you to Italian
[53:06] you you want to make God like as if he's
[53:09] a bunch of great
[53:12] people you you want to say that is a
[53:15] there is a separate God who is the
[53:16] father God who is the son and a separate
[53:18] God who is the Holy ghosts
[53:27] you want to baptize calling the name of
[53:30] each of those three gods
[53:34] and you are mistaken to think that
[53:36] father son Holy Ghost are his names
[53:46] to you my Oneness Brothers
[53:50] you understand that God is
[53:54] [Music]
[53:57] that but you are wrong when it comes to
[53:59] baptism
[54:02] because you simply baptized in the name
[54:03] of Jesus
[54:05] he said Jesus is the man
[54:09] but we know that Jesus was more than a
[54:12] man
[54:13] he had the title
[54:16] God himself so he was the Lord
[54:20] Jesus yes and he was also created and so
[54:25] he says I I don't believe your baptism
[54:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:33] and that is the interpretation of father
[54:36] son Holy Ghost
[54:39] and all the Oneness we are scratching
[54:41] their heads
[54:46] and he's still associated with all of
[54:49] them
[54:50] because he was a prophet he was sent to
[54:55] all of them
[54:57] a prophet comes from no denomination and
[55:00] the prophet is sent to all you know
[55:03] [Music]
[55:59] that's why I let them come foreign
[56:18] [Applause]
[57:01] foreign
[57:49] from around him tied his hand
[57:53] and said thus saith the Lord yep
[58:10] the man that he
[58:12] the man and here he was his prophecy
[58:16] the man that this has bound will be
[58:20] bound in Chains when he gets to
[58:23] Jerusalem
[58:24] um
[58:29] seeing the visions of the people then to
[58:31] read of Paul storms he told them said
[58:34] don't lose from this place and go
[58:37] because it will be to your harm now we
[58:40] all know that when Paul reached in
[58:42] Jerusalem he was bound in Chains
[58:46] and here is a
[58:48] foreign
[59:39] so his message is not even implicative
[59:41] it's not rather it's not uh there's no
[59:44] repercussions to his message
[59:50] you know it was just like informing Paul
[59:53] yeah
[59:54] but Paul already had seen it in a vision
[59:58] so you understand
[1:00:00] so these Prophets
[1:00:02] uh Prophets
[1:00:04] who are anointed to give the prophets
[1:00:11] in Acts chapter 21 it says and as we
[1:00:14] turn it there many days there came down
[1:00:16] from Judea a certain Prophet named and
[1:00:19] when he was come unto us he took Paul's
[1:00:21] garden and bound his own hands and feet
[1:00:24] and said thus saith the Holy Ghost so
[1:00:26] shall the Jews of Jerusalem bind the man
[1:00:29] that owned this garden and shall deliver
[1:00:31] him into the hands of the Gentiles
[1:00:33] to
[1:00:43] it's your
[1:00:44] Acts 20 21 10 21 10 which one is
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:01:49] was a new testament Prophet
[1:01:53] look at the Spirit of Prophecy falling
[1:01:55] down there and telling Paul about it
[1:02:03] from Jerusalem and found Paul and tie
[1:02:06] this God around him and turn over and
[1:02:09] say thus saith the Lord the man that all
[1:02:11] this will be by chains when he gets to
[1:02:14] Jerusalem
[1:02:30] who stood up and told foretold what
[1:02:33] would take place he was a prophets
[1:02:42] not a man with a gift of prophets
[1:02:47] foreign
[1:03:02] just like we have
[1:03:04] pastors
[1:03:06] to me
[1:03:09] we also have the office
[1:03:27] and they can prophesy In The Name Of The
[1:03:30] Lord
[1:04:30] foreign
[1:05:29] do you believe it
[1:05:47] right mean
[1:05:51] we cannot have two major prophets in our
[1:05:55] generation
[1:05:57] remember this prophet of our time during
[1:06:01] the night was supposed to come yeah
[1:06:09] so before between this message and the
[1:06:11] Rapture there is no other message
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:16] there is no other message
[1:06:21] and yes there are many other prophets
[1:06:28] who are real gifted men
[1:06:32] real prophets I was in Nigeria and I sat
[1:06:37] next to a brother
[1:06:40] Uganda and this brother uh kind of
[1:06:43] started to prophesy
[1:06:48] without finishing he was speaking of my
[1:07:09] still are in existence
[1:07:14] Hallelujah
[1:07:23] he is
[1:07:28] Hallelujah I mean and you are not
[1:07:30] supposed to follow his message like life
[1:07:33] and death uh
[1:07:38] why because you already have a message
[1:07:49] and that is
[1:08:18] America or some other place or even or
[1:08:22] even in in moment
[1:08:25] they will not be affected by my message
[1:08:41] [Applause]
[1:08:58] must be filtered through the major
[1:09:01] message of the major prophet yes
[1:09:08] hey man I mean
[1:09:10] so if a pastor comes and says I'm the
[1:09:12] prophet here and then he begins to
[1:09:13] preach things that are not in the
[1:09:15] message
[1:09:42] you see now this is a gift to professors
[1:09:46] it's among the nine spiritual gifts
[1:09:50] and this is what you find in many of the
[1:09:52] Pentecostals
[1:09:55] and they mistake it for Prophets
[1:10:03] so let me let us go through this then we
[1:10:06] shall conclude after that
[1:10:09] Solomon is here
[1:10:11] now there is a lot of difference between
[1:10:13] I give to prophecy and the prophet
[1:10:16] is
[1:10:19] the prophecy may be on one night on one
[1:10:23] tonight
[1:10:34] it's them nine spiritual gifts that
[1:10:37] works in the body area
[1:10:41] but a prophet is Born the prophet
[1:10:46] all done through their life
[1:10:59] someone just walk over to you
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:03] foreign
[1:12:31] that means people are not yielding
[1:12:33] enough for them not believing them
[1:12:35] anymore
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:13:16] yes now
[1:13:28] we have the word of wisdom
[1:13:30] word of knowledge
[1:13:33] this designing our Spirits
[1:13:37] diverse kinds of tongues and the
[1:13:39] production of tongues Faith healing
[1:13:44] of Miracles are you following me are you
[1:13:48] here
[1:13:52] foreign
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:14:08] [Music]
[1:14:53] [Music]
[1:15:00] foreign
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:43] coffee
[1:15:58] that's wisdom
[1:16:01] now that's a revelation
[1:16:03] there's a word of knowledge
[1:16:08] understood what brother had and they
[1:16:11] thought they had word of knowledge
[1:16:14] foreign
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:17:12] just think and then you give a profit
[1:17:15] if you have ever given a prophecy
[1:17:18] of the prophets you will notice
[1:17:22] oh that is also speaking in tongues
[1:17:28] and giving a prophecy this is
[1:17:39] the word of knowledge or
[1:17:42] wisdomania everybody is
[1:17:47] but one of them has a gift
[1:17:51] you understand I believe when when
[1:17:54] Solomon passed the Judgment many people
[1:17:57] must have laughed
[1:18:00] but the gift of Prophecy
[1:18:03] speaking in tongues
[1:18:06] this is inspirational
[1:18:09] it comes with inspiration
[1:18:12] you know when a preacher stands here
[1:18:15] is that being a gift to Professor
[1:18:18] it must be inspired
[1:18:21] it's not dry yeah comes with inspiration
[1:18:27] it's not from him
[1:18:31] according to your prayers
[1:18:36] and whenever it comes it also inspires
[1:18:39] you
[1:19:15] and not be a prophet um
[1:19:20] I'll give you examples here
[1:19:23] first was one of them
[1:19:25] Hallelujah I mean I wanted to hear the
[1:19:28] prophet of escape
[1:19:30] and one of them in John 11 49.
[1:19:35] and one of them named Caiaphas being the
[1:19:37] high priest that same year I said unto
[1:19:39] them you know nothing at all no consider
[1:19:43] that it is expedient for us that one man
[1:19:46] should die for the people and that the
[1:19:48] world nation perished
[1:20:03] foreign
[1:21:27] foreign
[1:22:33] foreign
[1:22:59] so the prophets can be given by the good
[1:23:01] and the bad
[1:23:05] that's why it has to be done
[1:23:08] that is right or wrong
[1:23:12] oh I love the Lord don't you love the
[1:23:15] Lord
[1:23:16] I'll give you another example here
[1:23:21] he wanted to kill David and hear this in
[1:23:26] first Samuel chapter 19 verse
[1:23:34] and told him that all Soul had done to
[1:23:37] him and he and so Samuel went and dwelt
[1:23:40] in Niles
[1:23:43] and it was told Saul saying behold David
[1:23:46] is at Nile in Rama and so said
[1:23:49] Messengers to David and when they saw
[1:23:51] the company of the prophets prophesying
[1:23:54] and uh excuse me and Samuel was standing
[1:23:58] as appointed over them the spirit of the
[1:24:01] Lord was upon the messengers of soul and
[1:24:03] they also prophesied
[1:24:16] foreign
[1:24:47] and I believe they even maybe had swords
[1:24:52] they were sent to go catch him alive or
[1:24:55] dead
[1:25:02] this boy was going to take over his
[1:25:04] kingdomeness
[1:25:09] order is given
[1:25:11] the boys like dogs
[1:25:21] I mean David was hidden
[1:25:25] question is
[1:25:27] you know Samuel was a prophet and I
[1:25:31] believe there were many other Minor
[1:25:32] Prophets
[1:25:37] we are all in one company
[1:26:15] foreign foreign
[1:26:28] thank you
[1:26:30] what were they prophets no the spirit of
[1:26:34] Prophecy that just come upon him
[1:26:37] let us continue this is amazing and when
[1:26:41] Saul was told about peace
[1:26:44] he sent other Messengers
[1:26:47] and they prophesied also likewise
[1:27:05] easy
[1:27:18] your majesty oh which team send me
[1:27:20] information I'll bring that boy here
[1:27:23] okay go ahead again this is the third
[1:27:25] time is usually the perfect time
[1:27:35] foreign
[1:27:54] hallelujah
[1:27:58] oh my God I mean whoever is today I must
[1:28:01] have said this is like a saga Williams
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:11] himself said let me go myself
[1:28:44] and the spirit of the Lord was upon him
[1:28:52] foreign
[1:29:23] foreign
[1:29:58] [Applause]
[1:30:49] was a stronger man Hallelujah
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:31:08] hallelujah
[1:31:16] amen
[1:31:19] all the things
[1:31:52] [Laughter]
[1:32:07] hallelujah amen was it of God
[1:32:12] it works it was a man a prophet no um
[1:32:20] where there are some people who are
[1:32:22] going to judge this purpose of course
[1:32:23] why do I have one
[1:32:30] problems
[1:32:38] and the man was the enemy of David
[1:32:42] I tell you what's the whole night sorry
[1:33:07] and everybody was shocked
[1:33:10] his soul also has it become one of them
[1:33:16] that's how the Pentecostals are confused
[1:33:20] when they prophesy like that they think
[1:33:22] they're also prophets
[1:33:24] and they said they don't need William
[1:33:26] Brothers
[1:33:53] somewhere
[1:34:07] Samuel was still there somewhere else
[1:34:18] in Acts chapter 21 verse
[1:34:22] and when we had finished our course we
[1:34:25] came to uh
[1:34:27] solemis and saluted the Brethren and
[1:34:30] Abode with them one day and the next day
[1:34:32] we we that way of Paul's company
[1:34:35] departed and came unto Syria and we
[1:34:37] entered into the house of Philip the
[1:34:39] Evangelist which was one of the seven
[1:34:41] and aboard with him and the same man man
[1:34:44] had four daughters pageants
[1:34:47] which they professor
[1:34:49] Netflix
[1:35:06] [Music]
[1:35:21] and they did prophesy
[1:35:25] so even sisters
[1:35:39] it is of the Lord
[1:35:42] God will make it fall upon anything
[1:35:46] oh Brothers you should pray for your
[1:35:48] sister for your little daughters to be
[1:35:50] perfect
[1:35:54] let them prophesy

[1:36:01] Hallelujah
[1:36:03] praise the name of the Lord these things
[1:36:06] are ours we need to be afraid
[1:36:08] for our children and our grandchildren
[1:36:13] these gifts are not only for Pentacles
[1:36:19] actually the True Church of Jesus Christ
[1:36:32] of denomination Pentecost it can you say
[1:36:35] into foreign
[1:36:49] and these prophets have indicated in
[1:36:51] First Corinthians 14 29 where he says
[1:36:54] let them be judged with
[1:37:01] read that and let us read this as the
[1:37:04] last scripture in First Corinthians 14
[1:37:06] 29-33 let the prophet speak two or three
[1:37:09] and let the other judge if anything be
[1:37:12] revealed to another that seated by let
[1:37:14] the first hold his peace and for ye may
[1:37:17] all prophesy one by one that all may
[1:37:19] learn and all and that all may be
[1:37:21] comforted and that the spirit of
[1:37:22] prophets are subject to the prophets for
[1:37:25] God is not the author of confusion but
