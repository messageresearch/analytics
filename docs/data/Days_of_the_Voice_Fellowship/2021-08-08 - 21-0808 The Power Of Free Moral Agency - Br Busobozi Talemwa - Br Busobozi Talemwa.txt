wonderful week where the lord has been able to graciously give us some souls and yesterday we had uh after the the crusade you know that was was done uh we had a few people who came actually one young man came and he he said he wanted to give his life to jesus i he said that uh he had been he had gone to a church somewhere and they had told him to give first of all the requirements for baptism was number one he had to pay his drive number two he had to have to bring his parents one of the parents and number three he had to pay baptism [Music] man but uh yesterday when he heard us preaching and he said i believe the lord brought this for me was able to reach out to him and you know get to talk to him a little bit and he said yeah i'm ready which i put up for you as the service was starting if you missed if you missed it you can check it out on youtube later you know he is the young boy with a short one every final service and also some two more people one actually called me after we had even left the scene a total of three souls amen praise the lord [Music] we appreciate those who came to participate and take part in the meetings sister grace also came in [Music] of you brother by the marvin organ and many of you that i might not mention here we want to appreciate you all for coming to take part [Music] so this morning i have something that i'd like to speak to you from my [Music] but i pray that the lord will use it will use me to be a blessing to you so pray with me and now as i uh see what the lord has for us for now i request you to stand on your feet if you can and let us read the scriptures genesis chapter 4 6-7 i have uh very i caught a very important subject because it will address a lot of things that you know many young people could have in their minds [Music] unto cain why at thou wrath and why the continents if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well see life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him lord have blessings upon his word this morning i'm going to be speaking on the power of free moral agents this is going to ask for you to be very attentive to be able to grasp what the world spirit and i also request you to help me preach by receiving it by saying a man wherever you are if you're still standing you can be seated so now i'm speaking on the power of free moral agents as usual i don't usually plan to speak for long maybe an hour or less if at any time i got beyond one hour just to know the holy spirit is just trying to push me maybe someone else is still getting something now this subject is a very good subject to speak about during these trying times of the pandemic that is going on all over the world many people are blaming things that are happening around them towards the pandemic that is happening and going on again and so they are saying this is happening to me because of coffee that is happening to me because of coffee and if it weren't for coffee i wouldn't be this way but they went and uh some also blame others i was not you know just away from my job or laid off i wouldn't be this way singapore if i had not married this man i wouldn't be this way if i did not you know the problem is this woman oh my god you know the problem is that man that friend of mine that's so and so i'm a security final and so everybody thinks that their problem is someone so they think that they would not be in the situations or conditions they are in if they had not met someone in their lives one thing this morning but god has given a power to you the human race that he has not given to anything else [Applause] whatever happens around you and in your life is because of you brother said that the greatest enemy he had was william branham and therefore the greatest enemy that you have in your life that will hinder you that he needs you to achieve the things you want to achieve in your life is you know achieved [Music] [Applause] even jesus himself cannot force you to do anything power to do good is before you power to do bad is before you will be guaranteed so it is up to you to really do what you want to do if you want to be a good christian the power is in your hands this kind of power god never gave it to animals god never gave it to birds god never gave it to uh to the floor and found cartoon natives god never gave it to insects that god has given to the human race and that nothing will happen to them without their input god has decided to and the times [Applause] amen in the nature and in the image of god himself but there is something man never lost him man had it before the fall and the man still has it after the fall [Music] and that thing my brother and sister children of ghana is the power of free moral agency hallelujah [Music] before the fall how did the father in your motor what is acceptable and pleasing to me will you not be accepted the way now i wanted to remember that god here is talking to kane who is yes some people don't know that but it has been revealed to us in this precious message the king was not a seed of god declaring it was the seed of the serpent amen could not be saved if you do what is good single correct if you do what is acceptable to me if you do what is pleasing to me will you not be accepted don't kill this way so don't tell me that god was just telling lies don't tell me that god was just having a light moment just joking around god is god and it does not change and what he says he fulfilled and here he tells this voice he tells cain if you knew well i will accept if god has the power to save [Applause] its desire meaning to it is [Music] [Music] ye that is something that separates us from the rest of the creatures all the other creatures don't have this power you are responsible for your own actions yes can you tell yourself right now we're gandhi wherever you are you're not you're already tell yourself i am responsible for my own actions [Music] come on come on don't begin blaming the devil the [Music] [Applause] i am not a prophet some of you might say well just like a woman is chosen a woman doesn't choose herself so it's the man that chooses her career so you know this came to me as i was as i was you know combing my hair and then this revolution just dropped down you know chances and come to think of it and you know the man makes a choice brother also says we're gonna pronounce i did not prepare that quote here i know even but he also says that the sister also she has to make a choice let me see if i can get it quickly for you i think it is in the message the marriage of the lamb hallelujah amen if i don't get it we'll just quote it later this is good for young sisters and younger brothers and old ones for you to know that the choice you make jokes did you get it this just came to me moments ago and i did not be get the quote for you but i want to get it for you here just give me a moment if i get it number one all right the choosing of the bride uh okay brother you can just get these words in many things of life we are given a choice [Music] choose our own way that we want to live oh quest education is a choice we can choose whether we are going to be educated or whether we are not going to be educated boy and girl has to choose whether they are going to try to live right or not live right it is a choice choice is a good thing your eternal destination is a choice and maybe tonight some of you will make that choice of where you are going to spend eternity before this service ends tonight there will be one time that if you turn god down many times there will be one time you will never turn him down oh that you will turn him down the last time there is a line between mercy and judgment and it's a dangerous thing for a man or a woman boy or girl to step across that line for there is no return when you step across that dead life one word whatever so tonight it might be the time that many will make their decision where they will spend the endless eternity a younger man or a younger woman stepping out on life [Applause] has been given a right to make a choice the younger woman has a right to accept or to reject it but it is still a choice on both sides [Applause] amen praise the name of the lord we find out that that even if it is the younger man that makes the choice listen to me a girl that would ever go to approach a younger man to ask for marriage or to ask for love that one is not free to be a wife to anyone completely have you can't be done because that you can never make a good wife younger sister if you felt you have the energy and the power to go and propose to a brother named [Applause] many people say i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and i saw to god and i saw to god and i showed god. no he says no he did not seek him [Music] but even if it is that way in the same way we find out that still you have a right to a choice to accept his choice of you oh praise the name of the lord therefore you do not need to be ashamed and refused by saying i'll pray over it five brothers coming to you i will pray over it i can give you many people come to jesus christ they come around him like their wife he chooses them and then they linger here one feet in the world one feet in christmas if you love jesus forsake the world if you love jesus make that choice tell him jesus i love you i know you are mine i have forsaken all the pleasures of the wise praise the name of the lord amen in a message of prisoner brother gave me that quote the prophet says something here very interesting because he must put every man on the same basis oh he put the first one he put the first man on the wrong buses [Music] if he must put every man on that as he must make every man as a free moral agent just like he did the first one if he does not give you a right of choice it means that you put the first man adam and eve on the wrong basis exactly tonight like adam and eve there is no difference right and wrong sex before either or either one of us uh hallelujah it's unfortunate it's a fortunate right and wrong since before you are happy you can make your choice that's the way adam and eve did it forget about those people who tell you it is god who caused everything to happen [Music] yeah the prophet says that god knew that adam would seal it so that you can do that choice to sin by himself and because god knew that would happen being a good god he wanted that to happen so that he can be a savior himself to bear the price of death he had to die so that the price can be paid and then it can go back to uh all over again to free moral agents and he says his subjects that desire to be free they could go what is what is finding you this morning judge me please i want you to listen to me whatever is bringing you this morning to your next visit you have the power within you to god free in hell no matter how many demons come to attack you they may be powerful yes but they have no power over you if you choose not to bow down by choosing [Applause] you are sorry so you can't make it you are sorry those demons of your clan of family or relatives listen to me in the name of the lord what it is they have not power over you by making a choice this morning and you have the you have power to go freely listen to me this morning you have the power to make a choice [Music] there's a condition that you can be included one way like yourself when you get up some may say well maybe i'm serving seed maybe this message was not meant for me maybe it is not meant for me listen in the message things that are to be uh of course we know that jesus has gone to prepare our place the tremendous to receive a people unto himself oh great why did i learn to be who those people are i want to have a chivalry i hope it's we that you might [Applause] amen even if you don't feel you are a part of those people that he has chosen if you feel you are not among those you are going to prepare our place i'm here to tell you this morning [Applause] [Music] [Music] if i want to live for christ i will live for christ oh yes sir yes sir if you want to start that business you can't start that business over 4000 scriptures where shoes will and other words expressing volition or will are used [Music] [Applause] your relationship with god is entirely on a voluntary basis [Applause] [Music] and every choice you make will have a consequence if you behave as if you're serving him when he don't love him in your heart god is not mocked god will be entirely responsible for all evil for all sickness for all poverty for all rebellion and all like 200 kilometers per hour and you get an accident is god responsible [Music] if you choose to go and get someone's daughter that you're not married to and you cause them a man to be pregnant is not responsible for if you go out there and commit fornication and get hiv and he becomes sick is god responsible [Applause] if you choose not to go to school and you are not educated and you get no job is god responsible [Applause] if you have education and you don't find a job and you don't get money and you become poor [Applause] choices [Music] and you become very dry no we don't know that it's god is responsible for the never will tempt you and then next thing you'll be saying maybe it is god's will it is not it's jesus if you choose not to sing when others are singing and you don't receive the blessings of god it's good responsibility if if you are a believer and you don't pay your tithe and god the bible says that you must pay yourself and you don't pay it it's good response but if you don't if if it doesn't bless you you have a power to make a choice revelation 2 verse 17 says and the spirit and the bride says come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is at us come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely 22 17. the holy spirit and the bride which is the church or the believers say come lord oh my god [Music] and let the one who here say come here let the one who wishes take and drink the water of life without costs the one who chooses to take the word let him take it oh yes if you are thirsty and you choose not to drink and you die because of constipation what is wrong with them it is your choice if [Music] john 3 16 4 so god loved the world and he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life [Music] is really up to you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not a filthy locker but of a ready mind first peter 5 2 peter in the amplified bible it says shepherd and guide and protect the flock of god among you [Music] some have even gone oh god help us to an extra mile of saying that the ones as fast as to choose [Applause] [Applause] we should go for an event [Music] so not loading [Applause] set a pattern of integrity for your congregation versus two to three amplified version amen hallelujah i mean now listen to me amen at this time we shall continue with the other quote which we were reading from the other source listen he says god has god has different purposes all working towards the ultimate purpose of bringing man back to the place where he was before the fall the beginning of the year you need to get there your church you know come here and pardon him of all possibility of failing in the future he is bringing us out into a place folk before the fall and also is removing from us he's purging us of all the possibilities [Music] i before the fall man [Applause] the kingdom of love is the plan of god to ev to end evil and suffering for us give me first christian chapter 15. according then come at the end when he shall when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet the last enemy shall be destroyed is death under his feet he has put all things under his feet but when he said all things are put under his him it is manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all uh originally [Applause] is to have a kingdom a kingdom not ruled by men but a kingdom that he himself will rule yes [Applause] and i pray that whatever it is has been binding your life to the next problem under his feet but at the end of it all he will take you to our place [Applause] and accept him to be the lord of your life let me finish the other quote no one recognizing that that endless decisions are necessary to daily life can deny the fact of free acts and conduct for we know we have freedom of action did you hear what i said can i read it again no one recognizing that endless decisions are necessary to daily life can deny the fact of free acts and conduct terrible dwellings man has to have endless decisions in life you believe that end that you have to decide every day in your day life then you have freedom of action or you make them mediocre you have freedom of moral action for the next game you have freedom of god you know concerning right and wrong oriented courage to furniture are you hearing me brother sister obedience is meaningless without the possibility of disobedience what good is the law if what good is the law if there is nothing to break and then your [Music] i've seen you know even attractive sent me how you are reaching out and telling many about this message that's wonderful that's how young men ought to be whether in school or not you can make a choice to tell our people about jesus or not [Music] [Applause] the possibility of disobedience is always there we are until now you have made more than a thousand choices oh or not you made a choice to cut your fingernails you made a choice whether to to paint your face or not you made a choice you i saw some sisters saying you know what brother branham's wife i saw she was wearing a skirt which looked like it was just below a little bit above the knees if that [Applause] it is your choice how you want to be known how you want to present yourself to the people it is your choice as a christian for one person oh my brother and sister it is your choice this morning if god imposes his own will god has you are blinded to this denomination that saturn has twisted you into and it's the perversion of goddess original word george no longer son of god no longer a son of god no longer a son of god i'm continuing hanging down in his face no longer [Music] that is not a son of god [Applause] saturn has succeeded in perverting and taking over this world and making it his kingdom that man was put on by three more agents to choose for themselves what kind of the of life they desire and that shows what is in your heart you know you know you have a miniskirt no no i'm not sure i am a discussion on your very best saying god bless you don't you worry sister sacrifice i will tell you what the prophet says your actions speak so loud that your voice is [Music] let me go to a man and say oh we are all christians we belong to church and strip jesus is hanging all over his office oh i know here in africa most of our sisters they don't have really long i have seen sisters who had short hair their hair couldn't grow but god gave them long hair you know better than that if you see a sister saying she's the sister but she has short hair let her say she's a christian wearing paint and makeup short a christian christian you're not better than that oh my name is the word of god teaches you better than that that you could sex how is god going to put a dishonorable thing in his kingdom [Music] no son not at all no sir yourself they show their desire [Music] that bitter substance is not any part any god anymore we have lost the god now because we are children of god when our children have our catholics there are things we can no longer age nature you can't eat that anymore that's what i've been you can't dare look at it anymore if someone brings it close to you you would just leave it oh my gosh you can't there is nothing in you you can't you know watch those uh wildly movies and see you you there's certain things you can no longer do what where you interact yes certain books you can no longer read one way you people will tell you they seem to be your friends please please can you can no
