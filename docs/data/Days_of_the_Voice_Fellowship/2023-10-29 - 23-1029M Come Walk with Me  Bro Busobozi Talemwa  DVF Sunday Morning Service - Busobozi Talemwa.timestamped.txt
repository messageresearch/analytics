[1:35:04] not yet started the
[1:35:06] process don't feel bad for those ones
[1:35:08] who are already in the
[1:35:11] process as a matter of fact all all of
[1:35:13] you young people who have not yet
[1:35:14] started the process you should support

[1:35:38] for
[1:35:40] them amen so I'd like to uh also
[1:35:46] announce that uh we had a meeting last
[1:35:50] Sunday
[1:35:53] and we we made a few changes regarding
[1:35:57] our youth meetings
[1:36:02] preparations we had planned to have the
[1:36:04] youth meetings here in this
[1:36:08] place but we have changed that because
[1:36:12] we found a better
[1:36:15] venue um we were going to we were
[1:36:18] planning to have a Friday night here
[1:36:23] and then Sun Saturday and Sunday in a
[1:36:26] tent which is rented at the
[1:36:32] school and then you know we we we use
[1:36:36] the
[1:36:37] school but that is proving to be quite
[1:36:40] more
[1:36:44] expensive as well as inconvenience in
[1:36:47] many
[1:36:48] ways of course if it rained if the
[1:36:50] weather was not good would also be
[1:36:55] suffering but God gave us a good a
[1:36:58] better
[1:37:01] venue I also did not know it
[1:37:05] previously it's called
[1:37:07] past's uh what's thatw P's discipleship
[1:37:14] Network it is
[1:37:18] in you can Google it and you will be
[1:37:21] able
[1:37:24] we sent out a new flyer brother Isaac
[1:37:27] made a new
[1:37:30] flyer uh if you have a
[1:37:33] smartphone and there is a Cod
[1:37:38] there does anyone have that

[1:37:51] anybody has
[1:37:55] [Music]
[1:38:00] that yes no

[1:38:12] their okay I'm trying to find it here
[1:38:14] but I can't find it
[1:38:17] right you'll have to excuse me because I
[1:38:19] did not plan to show you this
[1:38:25] but we have also we have also done a few
[1:38:27] prints yes can you uh bring it
[1:38:32] up so
[1:38:37] uh it's okay you can hold your
[1:38:40] phone so you see on this
[1:38:45] flyer there
[1:38:46] is
[1:38:49] uh there there is is a how do they call
[1:38:53] it it's not a

[1:39:12] there like I'm doing
[1:39:14] now it will bring you a link to
[1:39:19] click and it will take you to that
[1:39:24] address so what's this
[1:39:27] address showing you
[1:39:29] that discipleship
[1:39:32] Network so anyone can will be able to
[1:39:34] find the
[1:39:37] address like that so we are going to put
[1:39:39] that also on on the website is not yet

[1:40:07] whoever wants can be able to sleep
[1:40:11] there so they have HS where they will
[1:40:14] put
[1:40:17] mattresses I I believe that most of the
[1:40:20] most of all all of the members of this
[1:40:22] Fellowship they should sleep
[1:40:28] there help us concentrate and Camp
[1:40:32] there and uh we are going we are
[1:40:34] planning to have a wonderful
[1:40:37] time we are praying for the young people
[1:40:39] to have an encounter with
[1:40:42] God it's a wonderful time of the year
[1:40:44] for
[1:40:46] us so uh we agreed that every member of
[1:40:50] the church will at least contribute
[1:40:57] 100,000s to help contribute towards the
[1:41:01] cause we need about uh on the new venue
[1:41:05] we needed more but now we need about 26
[1:41:11] Millions
[1:41:13] so prepare to do
[1:41:16] that to contribute on that I don't think

[1:43:05] it the ministry of yeah told to me
[1:43:08] luganda the ministry of Elijah in the
[1:43:09] end
[1:43:12] time I thought on doing something a bit
[1:43:15] uh out of the out of the ordinary
[1:43:19] today
[1:43:22] take a question and answer service
[1:43:23] Sunday
[1:43:27] morning
[1:43:30] subject but I changed my
[1:43:33] mind I'm thinking maybe uh on
[1:43:38] Wednesday uh we could plan it this
[1:43:40] Wednesday if you have some
[1:43:43] questions on that subject it's a wide
[1:43:47] subject uh how many have questions out
[1:43:50] of that subject
[1:43:55] on the coming on the five comings of
[1:43:59] Elijah I'm not going to ask you to ask
[1:44:01] now but if you have a question just
[1:44:03] raise up your
[1:44:06] hand no one has a
[1:44:09] question okay the other one was Raising
[1:44:11] and then he noticed that
[1:44:14] other okay I'll ask again how many if
[1:44:17] you have a question just lift up your
[1:44:19] hand I want to know is there only one
[1:44:23] person okay how many we following these
[1:44:26] these seven services on
[1:44:32] Elijah okay okay how many did not have a
[1:44:35] chance to follow
[1:44:39] through okay so here's what we are going
[1:44:42] to
[1:44:43] do I'm going to ask you to go uh and
[1:44:47] follow through those
[1:44:49] services
[1:44:51] all of them if you
[1:44:53] can I believe you should if you
[1:44:56] can this
[1:44:59] Friday Friday night we're going to have
[1:45:01] a question and answer
[1:45:06] session on on on on on that subject we
[1:45:11] stream it for those who can't make it
[1:45:14] they can still send their questions and
[1:45:15] then you can deal with
[1:45:18] them but this morning I just want to
[1:45:21] take a little bit of a different time
[1:45:23] and speak on another
[1:45:26] subject not a teaching as
[1:45:29] such just something to share with us and
[1:45:32] encourage us this
[1:45:34] morning let us read again in Psalms
[1:45:39] 23 vers
[1:45:42] one I'll read one verse you read the
[1:45:44] second I read the third you read the
[1:45:45] fourth the Lord the Lord is my shepherd
[1:45:47] I shall not
[1:45:49] want
[1:45:57] he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the
[1:46:00] paths of righteousness for his name's
[1:46:14] sake amen amen now when we speak on uh
[1:46:19] this Psalm that David
[1:46:22] wrote David if there is something that
[1:46:25] David knew David knew he
[1:46:30] God and he knew that God was up for real
[1:46:38] business he was
[1:46:41] confident that he will always be with
[1:46:46] him and
[1:46:47] he he says here that even though I walk
[1:46:51] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:46:56] death I will fear no
[1:46:59] evil for thou with
[1:47:01] me there is something about walking with
[1:47:07] someone I don't know if some of you have
[1:47:10] ever taken a
[1:47:12] walk a lonely walk is a very difficult
[1:47:16] thing if you walk
[1:47:19] alone it's very difficult but if you
[1:47:22] walk together with
[1:47:25] somebody you you are you are happy you
[1:47:28] have company even even the Bible says
[1:47:32] that two are better than
[1:47:35] one you know God created
[1:47:39] everything and after creating everything
[1:47:42] each of them he said it is good it is
[1:47:44] good it is
[1:47:47] good when he created man in his own
[1:47:49] image
[1:47:51] he said it is not
[1:47:53] good for man to dwell
[1:47:57] alone can you imagine because man was
[1:48:00] walking
[1:48:02] alone and God knew that man desired to
[1:48:05] walk with
[1:48:09] somebody so brother Andrew now it is not
[1:48:12] good for you to be
[1:48:14] alone but very
[1:48:17] soon brother Andrew will walk with
[1:48:19] someone in this
[1:48:23] praise God those of you who are married
[1:48:26] you are not alone you are walking with
[1:48:30] somebody that is why I believe that
[1:48:32] marriage is not just marriage to have
[1:48:37] children marriage is for
[1:48:41] Comfort marriage is you know to have
[1:48:44] somebody for
[1:48:46] companionship marriage you know you
[1:48:48] someone you can share your trouble with
[1:48:51] someone that you can go through this
[1:48:53] life's journey
[1:48:55] with someone that can understand you and
[1:48:57] someone that you can
[1:49:00] understand so in the same way you know
[1:49:04] David here speaks these words he said
[1:49:07] even though I walk through the valley of
[1:49:08] the shadow of
[1:49:11] death he says I will fear no
[1:49:14] evil why won't he
[1:49:17] fear because God is with him
[1:49:21] you know you don't you don't have a lot
[1:49:23] of
[1:49:24] fear if you're walking with
[1:49:27] someone bam one time spoke of a little
[1:49:30] child a little boy going through a
[1:49:36] graveyard and you know
[1:49:39] alone and you know because of too much
[1:49:42] fear you know he tried to behave as if
[1:49:45] he was fearing
[1:49:48] nothing and walked through while
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:54] whistling but really that was because of
[1:49:58] fear and many people in this
[1:50:00] life are like that little boy in a
[1:50:05] graveyard they're walking
[1:50:07] alone and because they're working
[1:50:10] alone they have too much fear they have
[1:50:14] things begin to build
[1:50:16] up anxiety builds
[1:50:19] up has build up because of too much fear
[1:50:24] fear of the
[1:50:25] unknown you know like this little boy is
[1:50:27] walking through the through you know the
[1:50:31] graveyard he's imagining things because
[1:50:34] he's all alone but if I'm
[1:50:37] walking and one of the dead bodies comes
[1:50:41] out and then it finds me alone here oh
[1:50:45] all these people are dead you know the
[1:50:47] dread the fear comes with all
[1:50:51] that even just some little wind
[1:50:55] passing scar this little
[1:50:58] boy and you know life and the world is
[1:51:03] like that
[1:51:05] graveyard and you cannot go through this
[1:51:09] graveyard without Jesus and you go
[1:51:12] through well so that's why I'm speaking
[1:51:15] to you this
[1:51:16] morning come walk with me
[1:51:22] Jesus is telling us the same come
[1:51:26] with d said even though I walk through
[1:51:29] the valley of
[1:51:30] Shadow I will fear no evil why because
[1:51:34] you are with me if you with a
[1:51:36] companion if you are with a friend no
[1:51:40] matter what comes your way you know you
[1:51:42] have hope you have someone where you can
[1:51:45] run to you have somewhere where you can
[1:51:48] receive comfort
[1:51:51] and and and you know the Bible says in
[1:51:53] the Book of Genesis 5:
[1:51:56] 24 and Enoch walked with
[1:51:59] God and he was
[1:52:02] not because God took
[1:52:05] him there is something good about
[1:52:07] walking with
[1:52:09] God if you walk alone in this
[1:52:13] journey you can never
[1:52:16] overcome the Troubles of the world will
[1:52:19] consume you
[1:52:21] the problems of the world will
[1:52:23] consum I want you to understand that
[1:52:25] both Believers and nonbelievers face the
[1:52:28] same
[1:52:32] demons in times when Temptations around
[1:52:35] us
[1:52:37] B when s like C roll as the sing
[1:52:41] songwriter
[1:52:44] said when disease and pain has gripped
[1:52:48] its victim
[1:52:52] those moments when your back has hit
[1:52:54] against a
[1:52:57] wall you need to be able to speak like
[1:52:59] David
[1:53:00] spoke the Lord is my
[1:53:04] sheer the Lord is my sheer I shall not
[1:53:08] want he leadth me he's walking with me
[1:53:12] imagine those times when you don't have
[1:53:15] a coin in your
[1:53:17] pocket if you don't have a coin in your
[1:53:19] pocket
[1:53:21] at dvf we don't always talk about
[1:53:23] money but sometimes we do and this is
[1:53:27] one of those moments when you are poor
[1:53:31] when you are
[1:53:33] empty you're looking as at me as if you
[1:53:35] have never gone through that
[1:53:37] situation some of you may be going
[1:53:39] through it right
[1:53:41] now when it is very
[1:53:44] difficult when you don't have anywhere
[1:53:47] to
[1:53:48] run Jesus is telling you this morning
[1:53:51] come walk with
[1:53:53] me praise God
[1:53:57] hallelujah when when when thieves have
[1:53:59] come and stolen away something from you
[1:54:03] when the devil has come and taken away
[1:54:05] your joy you know when sickness has come
[1:54:09] and creeped your life you know when when
[1:54:12] Sorrows have come and swept over your
[1:54:15] soul when Temptations around you and
[1:54:18] trials beat and
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:22] and you feel you have nowhere to
[1:54:24] run let me tell you if you have Jesus
[1:54:28] you are working with him amen you are
[1:54:31] going to be able to say the Lord is my
[1:54:35] shepherd and he says come walk with
[1:54:38] me let's take a moment to talk about a
[1:54:42] Shepherd who is a
[1:54:45] Shepherd John 10:
[1:54:48] 11 it say say I am the Good
[1:54:52] Shepherd you could open brother and read
[1:54:54] out of out of the Bible it says I am the
[1:54:56] Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth
[1:54:58] his life for the Sheep but he that is
[1:55:00] unhearing and not the shepherd whose own
[1:55:03] the Sheep are not seeth the wolf coming
[1:55:06] and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the
[1:55:08] Wolf catches them and scattereth the
[1:55:10] Sheep the hearing fleeth because he is
[1:55:13] an hearing and carth not for the Sheep I
[1:55:16] am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep
[1:55:18] and I'm known of mine as the father
[1:55:20] knoweth me even so know I the father and
[1:55:23] lay down my life for the
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:48] Sheep
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:56:13] all right so now he says I'm the Good
[1:56:18] Shepherd that give my life for the
[1:56:22] sheep and he give an example he gives an
[1:56:25] example of an
[1:56:30] hiring he said he not a
[1:56:33] Shepherd you know let me tell you if you
[1:56:36] have a
[1:56:37] God the Bible says if the Lord does not
[1:56:39] keep the
[1:56:41] city they that keep keep in
[1:56:45] vain they watch in
[1:56:47] vain because why let me tell you if a
[1:56:50] thief
[1:56:51] came and and a God knew that his life
[1:56:56] may be at
[1:56:59] risk he may just take
[1:57:02] off and he will run away but if the
[1:57:07] owner of the home knowing that his
[1:57:10] children are
[1:57:11] here knowing that everything he has made
[1:57:13] is
[1:57:14] here he will die trying to save his
[1:57:18] family we are not just a friend of
[1:57:21] Jesus Jesus is not just our
[1:57:24] friend Jesus Is Our
[1:57:27] Shepherd Jesus is our
[1:57:30] family we are his family we are a part
[1:57:33] of him he is a part of us he is not
[1:57:37] willing to lose us at any
[1:57:40] time he's willing to give himself for
[1:57:44] us why because he's our
[1:57:47] Shepherd can you say Jesus is my
[1:57:51] shepherd amen he laid down his
[1:57:54] life for the Sheep because he knew the
[1:57:57] way down
[1:57:59] here not easy it is not easy to go
[1:58:03] through life's
[1:58:05] journey I cannot let them walk
[1:58:09] alone I cannot let you walk
[1:58:12] alone come walk with
[1:58:16] me the way may be sorrowful
[1:58:20] the way may be straight and
[1:58:23] narrow with
[1:58:25] me we need to realize
[1:58:28] friends no matter where the the the the
[1:58:31] the Winds of Life blows
[1:58:34] us the Temptations of of this
[1:58:38] life the lust of the
[1:58:41] world the pride of life the things that
[1:58:44] keep pulling on
[1:58:46] us the sorrow of life
[1:58:50] appointments I've seen people who were
[1:58:52] once
[1:58:54] heartbroken and
[1:58:56] disappointed that they themselves became
[1:58:58] AR
[1:59:01] W completely
[1:59:03] nothing they become
[1:59:06] useless because they don't have anyone
[1:59:09] if they trusted somebody so
[1:59:11] much and this person gives them
[1:59:15] up you know dumps them I am one of those
[1:59:20] My Father I remember was in in
[1:59:25] P when my father you know sat down with
[1:59:30] us I grew up watching my father as a
[1:59:35] preacher watching him preach to the
[1:59:38] people people getting saved and then in
[1:59:41] the evening time of his life you know he
[1:59:45] gets entangled with things of
[1:59:47] life he got entangled with things of
[1:59:53] Life cares of
[1:59:55] life and he back and then you know
[1:59:58] things began to change
[2:00:01] swiftly we sat around that table I
[2:00:04] remember that
[2:00:06] clearly which class are you in
[2:00:10] brother P5 I was almost his
[2:00:14] age you know come here brother I wanted
[2:00:18] to watch this
[2:00:21] age this young boy here has a whole life
[2:00:25] ahead of
[2:00:27] you but our
[2:00:30] generation is having many of
[2:00:34] them
[2:00:37] heartbroken disappointed about
[2:00:40] life where you cannot prove to
[2:00:43] them that there is a
[2:00:45] hope that things will be better
[2:00:49] and I was his
[2:00:51] age and my father
[2:00:54] said I've taken all of you to
[2:00:57] school and I was the fourth born he said
[2:01:01] from from
[2:01:03] today I'm I wherever you have stopped is
[2:01:06] where you
[2:01:10] would I thought about
[2:01:12] that in my young
[2:01:15] head I couldn't
[2:01:18] understand and then later on he left
[2:01:21] home and we were left alone with our
[2:01:25] mother who did not almost have
[2:01:29] anything all she had was relatives who
[2:01:31] had some
[2:01:34] money she worked hard that's why mothers
[2:01:37] you should work hard for your
[2:01:40] family to stand behind your husbands and
[2:01:43] to stand behind your your
[2:01:46] family to walk with them all through
[2:01:50] there is nothing like a good
[2:01:54] mother who will walk with his children
[2:01:57] no matter
[2:01:59] what no matter what life brings their
[2:02:02] way we will walk with them my mother
[2:02:05] walked with us sometimes she would come
[2:02:08] at
[2:02:09] school and you know you know you know go
[2:02:12] and her whatever and then pull out some
[2:02:16] money and and would give it to you and
[2:02:19] said now this is my
[2:02:21] transport this is your money you can use
[2:02:25] it and she's giving you maybe 20,000 or
[2:02:28] 10,000 and she's remaining with
[2:02:32] 10,000 I would look at those
[2:02:34] things it would touch my heart because
[2:02:37] at that moment I had someone that would
[2:02:39] walk with
[2:02:41] me but I'm telling you in life you have
[2:02:44] a lot of people who are
[2:02:47] heartbroken a lot of people who are
[2:02:51] heartbroken and by the way for that I'm
[2:02:53] preaching it is Sunday morning but I
[2:02:55] want to appreciate you mother you walked
[2:02:56] with
[2:02:59] me you really walked with
[2:03:02] me praise God praise God she was young
[2:03:06] she could have gotten married
[2:03:09] again I think she was 35 or something
[2:03:12] like
[2:03:13] that but she decided not to marry again
[2:03:16] but take care to walk with her children
[2:03:20] praise God God bless you mothers who
[2:03:23] have walked with
[2:03:26] your Hallelujah there's nothing good
[2:03:29] like a
[2:03:30] mother who will stand
[2:03:33] behind
[2:03:35] children stand behind a husband stand
[2:03:39] behind a home and this is my
[2:03:42] place I am not going to allow any demons
[2:03:45] to come and destroy my
[2:03:47] children
[2:03:49] I'm going to pray for them I'm going to
[2:03:52] do everything I can to walk with them
[2:03:56] through this life
[2:03:57] journey and our generation is
[2:04:01] heartbroken many young children are
[2:04:04] heartbroken many of them have turned to
[2:04:07] drugs many of them have turned to many
[2:04:10] things to immorality not because they
[2:04:14] desire but because the people they
[2:04:17] trusted
[2:04:19] the people they looked up
[2:04:22] to forsook them left them alone and so
[2:04:26] they had no
[2:04:28] hope and what did they decide to do they
[2:04:32] decided to walk alone in this dark LLY
[2:04:37] word and even as I'm preaching to you
[2:04:40] this
[2:04:41] morning I didn't plan to preach on
[2:04:43] this but yesterday you know I Heard a
[2:04:47] Voice I didn't know what was going to

[2:05:40] with
[2:05:41] us praise God he says I'm the I'm the

[2:05:55] them to inherit I have nothing to look
[2:05:59] up

[2:06:17] you you may be a woman and you were
[2:06:20] forsaken by your
[2:06:22] husband and you were left all
[2:06:25] alone to figure your way through
[2:06:28] life but I'm here this morning to tell
[2:06:31] you Jesus is saying come walk with
[2:06:35] me come walk with me I am a good
[2:06:39] shepherd and I'm going to give my life
[2:06:41] for my sheep I am not a hiring
[2:06:45] no amen he says the hiring
[2:06:51] fleeth because he's
[2:06:53] uniring and he does not care for the
[2:06:56] ship I am the Good Shepherd and I know
[2:07:00] my sheep and I am none of
[2:07:03] mine oh praise God and he said I lay
[2:07:07] down my life for the
[2:07:10] shame this is somebody that can never
[2:07:13] forsake
[2:07:14] me by the way if we if it comes down to
[2:07:17] our address
[2:07:20] and we realize we are talking about
[2:07:23] someone who is
[2:07:27] reliable we are talking about someone
[2:07:29] you can count
[2:07:32] on if you have never gone through any
[2:07:34] distress in
[2:07:37] life the suon this morning is not for
[2:07:41] you but if you've gone through those
[2:07:44] moments then God is speaking to you this
[2:07:47] morning amen because Jesus is
[2:07:51] reliable he can never forsake his
[2:07:55] subject because we are not just his
[2:07:59] subjects we are his children we are his
[2:08:03] family he will do everything and
[2:08:06] anything to save us he came down from
[2:08:10] glory and he gave his
[2:08:13] life for his

[2:08:26] shepherd he laid down his life for the
[2:08:29] Sheep we are the Sheep of his
[2:08:32] flock do we know him do you know him he
[2:08:37] says we know him and he he knows
[2:08:41] us Christ Alone he was crucified for us
[2:08:46] not a man not some
[2:08:49] organization you find very many
[2:08:52] people they listen to their Earthly
[2:08:56] Shepherds instead of The
[2:08:59] Shepherd of our
[2:09:01] souls but Jesus is The Shepherd of our
[2:09:04] soul he can never forsake
[2:09:07] us amen he he gave his
[2:09:11] life very
[2:09:13] life that we might have life more
[2:09:17] abundantly and even when life becomes
[2:09:21] difficult he's always there with
[2:09:24] us in First Corinthians chapter 1
[2:09:27] verse2 he says now this I
[2:09:30] say that every one of you sayth I am of
[2:09:33] Paul I am of appos and I
[2:09:42] ofas is Christ
[2:09:45] divided was Paul crucified for you
[2:09:49] oh you baptized in the name of
[2:09:52] Paul and I thank God that I baptized
[2:09:55] none of
[2:09:56] you chispas and
[2:09:59] gas L any should say that I had baptized
[2:10:02] in my own
[2:10:05] name so who was crucified for
[2:10:09] us Christ was crucified for us with
[2:10:13] canot walk with any other
[2:10:16] name even water
[2:10:20] baptism he says come walk with
[2:10:23] me Hallelujah we we can follow
[2:10:27] anybody as long as they following
[2:10:30] Christ but if somebody tells us to
[2:10:32] follow
[2:10:34] them when they're not walking with
[2:10:37] Christ then that is a
[2:10:41] hiring and they will mislead
[2:10:43] you but Jesus Christ can never mislead
[2:10:47] you
[2:10:48] he can never mislead his
[2:10:51] own Paul here says some say that I am of
[2:10:55] Paul I am
[2:10:59] of even in the message church is
[2:11:02] coming where people begin to follow
[2:11:06] pastors let let me say something here
[2:11:09] you see we we used to have churches
[2:11:12] Pentecostal
[2:11:15] churches making sign posts
[2:11:18] and you know on their sign
[2:11:20] post they put their
[2:11:23] picture and their names just like I I
[2:11:27] put days of the voice
[2:11:29] Fellowship fellowship and I put my wife
[2:11:31] there and
[2:11:35] myself
[2:11:38] Bop what
[2:11:44] is and then people are coming to our
[2:11:47] church
[2:11:49] because they're following
[2:11:51] us and you can say anything you want to
[2:11:56] say these people are really followers of
[2:11:59] these
[2:12:01] men you will tell them
[2:12:03] anything they tell you but Papa said
[2:12:07] something as long as he said something
[2:12:11] else they don't care what the Bible
[2:12:14] says but in the message this message
[2:12:17] which we
[2:12:19] what we call the end
[2:12:20] message that is not the
[2:12:23] case for us we have one
[2:12:25] Shepherd that is Jesus Christ is the
[2:12:29] shepherd to our souls he is the one we
[2:12:32] are
[2:12:33] following we are going to follow any
[2:12:36] man as long as he's leading us to that
[2:12:40] sh you know even Paul himself in the
[2:12:44] book of 1 Corinthians 11 he said be ye
[2:12:48] followers of
[2:12:49] me even as I also I am of
[2:12:53] Christ so in other words if I I don't
[2:12:57] follow
[2:12:58] Christ don't follow me and if I follow
[2:13:02] Christ then follow me brother bam one
[2:13:06] time he said if I said
[2:13:09] anything that is not in the
[2:13:12] Bible leave it
[2:13:15] alone amen why do we
[2:13:19] brother why do we quot his
[2:13:21] messages why do we believe him as El of
[2:13:24] the end time because everything William
[2:13:28] Bram
[2:13:29] preached every do every
[2:13:33] teaching been pointing us back to our
[2:13:37] shepher back to the
[2:13:39] Bible back to Jesus
[2:13:42] Christ I do not know any religion in the
[2:13:45] world or any religious movement in
[2:13:50] points people to Christ than this
[2:13:54] message this message does not point us
[2:13:57] to a
[2:13:58] [Applause]
[2:13:59] system you know some people they go
[2:14:02] around the
[2:14:04] world and and they preach they go two by
[2:14:09] two that those people who dress always
[2:14:11] they dress
[2:14:13] properly and they will always lead you
[2:14:15] to their
[2:14:16] organization you know they will always
[2:14:19] lead to their Church they will always
[2:14:21] lead you to their man of
[2:14:23] God the enter message
[2:14:27] listen not meant to point us to William
[2:14:36] Bram are you following me it's not meant
[2:14:39] to point us
[2:14:43] toam or your P or some great man
[2:14:48] this message has one purpose to point us
[2:14:52] to The Shepherd of our
[2:14:54] soul Jesus
[2:14:57] Christ who gave his life for
[2:15:00] us Paul the first church age
[2:15:04] messenger he said I have heard from
[2:15:07] among
[2:15:09] you for us we
[2:15:13] are for us no no no no for us we are
[2:15:16] following for us we are owned by by by
[2:15:21] Paul for us we are of Christ he say what
[2:15:25] are you talking
[2:15:27] about is Christ
[2:15:30] divided I ask you a question is Christ
[2:15:33] divided Christ is one so what Christ are
[2:15:37] the denominations
[2:15:41] projecting and you even find certain
[2:15:44] times people will only go to one
[2:15:50] group they will never go to any
[2:15:54] other even when they have an
[2:15:57] opportunity and I'm not talking outside
[2:15:59] I'm talking about
[2:16:02] inside are you following

[2:16:07] things this
[2:16:09] morning you find that somebody like

[2:16:30] there he
[2:16:32] cannot why because he's not a member

[2:16:40] follow because that is the right one is
[2:16:43] the only right one the only one is
[2:16:45] following that's what Apostle Paul is
[2:16:49] he saying did die for
[2:16:52] you did Paul die for you did die for you
[2:16:56] look we have one
[2:16:59] Shepherd and that is the one who bled
[2:17:01] and

[2:34:45] quick now my time is running let us look
[2:34:47] ATK Mark 8
[2:34:52] 8:34 and when he had called the people
[2:34:54] unto him with his disciples also he said
[2:34:58] unto them whosoever will come after me
[2:35:01] let him deny himself and take up his
[2:35:04] cross and follow
[2:35:15] me
[2:35:21] this is important
[2:35:22] now forever will save his life shall
[2:35:25] lose it but whosoever shall lose his
[2:35:27] life for my sake and the gospel's sake
[2:35:29] the same shall save
[2:35:39] itet a man if he shall gain the whole
[2:35:42] world and lose his own
[2:35:44] soul

[2:35:51] his
[2:35:53] soul whoever shall be ashamed of me and
[2:35:57] of my words in this adult and sinful
[2:36:01] generation h of him also shall the son
[2:36:04] of man be ashamed when he cometh in the
[2:36:06] glory of his father with the Holy
[2:36:14] Angels
[2:36:25] how many want to walk with
[2:36:26] Jesus he says come walk with
[2:36:29] me but he says if you are going to walk
[2:36:32] with
[2:36:33] me there is a
[2:36:35] cost there is a price also
[2:36:38] to he says you have to be
[2:36:42] ready to deny
[2:36:44] yourself
[2:36:47] and take up your
[2:36:49] cross and follow
[2:36:51] him whoever will save his
[2:36:57] life whoever shall lose his
[2:37:00] life for my sake and the gospel sake
[2:37:05] will save it I'm so glad that 17 years

[2:40:56] know who he was they did not understand
[2:40:59] why he did things way he
[2:41:02] did they thought his kingdom was here

[2:42:23] wife and even the Bible tells me God
[2:42:27] wants you to be
[2:42:29] happy with the wife of your
[2:42:32] youth brother and the moment you get

[2:43:06] are more more us
[2:43:11] there the Bible believes in a boy being
[2:43:16] happy with a
[2:43:20] girl in the right
[2:43:24] way the right way is when God gives you
[2:43:28] a
[2:43:29] wife where did Adam get his
[2:43:32] wife the Bible doesn't say Adam began
[2:43:37] demonstrating no not good I'm not happy
[2:43:41] now how can you do this everything is to
[2:43:46] only
[2:43:49] one my body my body
[2:43:54] my Adam was
[2:43:56] patient Adam was in the presence of God
[2:43:59] Adam waited for the will of

[2:44:04] immorality Adam waited for God to say it
[2:44:08] is not good for Adam to be
[2:44:12] alone and when God said that
[2:44:15] then God gave adam a
[2:44:18] wife the Bible says he that gets a
[2:44:22] wife has got favor from the
[2:44:27] Lord you see it is favor from the
[2:44:31] Lord when I say fav don't all of you go
[2:44:33] running to

[2:44:41] favor you get favor from the
[2:44:43] Lord when God gives when God gives your
[2:44:47] wife praise God oh my God Brother Martin
[2:44:52] you are
[2:44:55] favored brother
[2:44:57] fav brother
[2:45:00] fav come on anybody who has a wife here
[2:45:03] you favored let me tell you you should
[2:45:06] love your
[2:45:07] wies love
[2:45:09] them if the world out there you find
[2:45:13] them doing all sorts of things
[2:45:17] you who has your own show the world how
[2:45:21] it is
[2:45:22] done treat her like a
[2:45:25] princess show the wife that a wife is a
[2:45:29] precious
[2:45:31] thing Hollywood has taken a woman and
[2:45:36] uses a word which many people think is
[2:45:40] VG Hollywood has actually turned a woman
[2:45:44] into a sex
[2:45:50] G
[2:45:52] is what Hollywood has made a
[2:45:55] woman a woman is the most precious thing
[2:45:59] on
[2:46:01] earth after
[2:46:03] salvation when God gives you up a woman
[2:46:07] it means god trusts
[2:46:12] you so if you don't have a wife
[2:46:15] and you want one it means you have not
[2:46:18] earned the trust of God
[2:46:20] yet it means you should pray
[2:46:23] more and get God his trust so he can
[2:46:27] bring his daughter and give
[2:46:29] her and when you get a daughter of God
[2:46:33] and you treat her like your like your

[2:46:41] problem brother B would say wife a good
[2:46:45] wife a wife is the next best thing to

[2:47:33] disagreements you will disagree many

[2:50:47] but one that is God but if thou Willl
[2:50:50] enter into life keep the

[2:51:32] kept from my
[2:51:34] youth what like I
[2:51:37] yet Jesus said unto him thou will be
[2:51:43] perfect

[2:51:52] have treasure in and come and follow
[2:51:56] me praise God praise God I want us to
[2:52:01] look at two things
[2:52:03] here number one Jesus Is a Good
[2:52:08] Shepherd when he came to this young
[2:52:12] man and this young man etal
[2:52:16] life we have already seen that you have
[2:52:19] to deny
[2:52:21] yourself Lose Yourself so you can gain
[2:52:24] him but now here he's telling
[2:52:28] Jesus that uh uh what should I do please
[2:52:33] follow me here now and Jesus said go and
[2:52:36] do the
[2:52:38] Commandments okay the young man said
[2:52:41] I've done all this
[2:52:43] Commandments ever since I was a child
[2:52:46] I've done all of
[2:52:48] them Jesus now said if you want to be
[2:52:52] perfect there is one thing that you
[2:52:56] should how many want to be
[2:52:59] perfect I want to be
[2:53:02] perfect and here is one thing we should
