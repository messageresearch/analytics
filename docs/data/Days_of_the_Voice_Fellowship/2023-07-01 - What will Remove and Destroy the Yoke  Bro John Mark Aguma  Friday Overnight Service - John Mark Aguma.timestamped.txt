[56:13] they went to uh in those things with the
[56:16] family
[56:23] amen and so this evening
[56:27] the weather is not here I hope it's
[56:30] online and whoever is not here and
[56:32] online they're missing out yeah
[56:37] that's why we thought we should stream
[56:40] so that the others who are
[56:42] it's usually Miss Friday they can also
[56:44] partake of the services take
[56:51] you know we we labor to football to
[56:54] ensure that you get the food we get the
[56:56] food
[56:59] so imagine that a preacher prepares to
[57:03] preach and then you don't come
[57:07] in
[57:10] the world service loses meaning
[57:13] yeah so that's why your presence here is
[57:16] very important
[57:18] new uh uh this Pulpit is because of you
[57:24] amen God has more for you
[57:29] that's why whenever we we have a service
[57:32] we want to be here
[57:36] there's a brother Michael that is
[57:39] fellowshipping with us for the first
[57:40] time

[1:18:19] yeah briefly we shall look at some texts
[1:18:24] of the the word
[1:18:28] really yesterday when I boarded the bus
[1:18:32] I was also wondering what can I go and
[1:18:34] say
[1:18:37] what will I tell the people
[1:18:40] but there's something there is a
[1:18:42] scripture that came into my house
[1:18:45] which is the description
[1:18:54] let's look at that scripture
[1:18:57] and I want you to take the text of the
[1:19:00] message today
[1:19:03] what will remove
[1:19:09] nature
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:20:09] Saturday
[1:20:26] and it shall come to pass in that is
[1:20:31] that his burden shall be taken away um
[1:20:41] shall be removed off from thy name
[1:20:49] shall be destroyed because of the
[1:20:51] anointing
[1:20:54] that's what the scripture says
[1:20:58] we want to know what is
[1:21:02] and we want to know
[1:21:07] we are believers we are the message
[1:21:11] but do you know the burden that you are
[1:21:14] you know
[1:21:17] the devil has tied you with foreign
[1:21:49] foreign
[1:23:11] [Applause]
[1:23:20] foreign
[1:24:05] the flesh is not happy
[1:24:40] there are three enemies
[1:25:04] flesh is
[1:25:09] and because of the flesh
[1:25:15] the Lord
[1:25:18] me I'm so happy because he did that
[1:25:22] I was not going to be safe yes
[1:25:28] Korea
[1:25:42] Hallelujah
[1:25:44] yes that's one great enemy yeah
[1:25:53] it is
[1:25:56] a burden to our Salvation
[1:26:06] amen Amina the second thing is this
[1:26:10] world that we are living in yeah that's
[1:26:13] one of the enemies
[1:26:16] remember what the devil told the Lord
[1:26:18] Jesus
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:27] and because of the things that belong on
[1:26:29] them because of the glittering things
[1:26:41] [Music]
[1:26:43] that's another
[1:26:45] factor or another thing
[1:26:48] that always hinders us and see churches
[1:26:52] so the third one is
[1:26:56] the master of everything
[1:26:59] those are the great enemies
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:04] but we want to look
[1:27:07] what will remove
[1:27:11] but at the last of that scripture
[1:27:15] says it will be destroyed by the
[1:27:18] anointing
[1:27:22] foreign
[1:28:30] has told us anything
[1:28:33] which is
[1:28:36] only be removed
[1:28:38] it will only be destroyed by that
[1:28:42] anointing
[1:28:45] the book of ethical chapter 9 verse 2.
[1:28:53] so we we are going to look at some
[1:28:57] people there there were six men together
[1:29:03] that one of uh among those men there was
[1:29:08] one man who was dressed with white linen
[1:29:11] clothes
[1:29:19] foreign
[1:29:37] and
[1:29:41] saying day and night because of the
[1:29:44] Abomination which is in the world
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:56] then later
[1:29:59] they were instructed
[1:30:05] everyone without you
[1:30:09] um
[1:30:17] in the book of Ephesians chapter
[1:30:28] do not grieve
[1:31:07] takes place
[1:31:10] a change of life will take place
[1:31:18] because Christ is the Holy Ghost is in
[1:31:22] you
[1:31:26] is it the one who lives in you not you
[1:31:30] living
[1:32:29] come on foreign
[1:32:46] are we together
[1:32:48] oh I'm just making noise
[1:32:51] are we together are we getting something
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:57] Hallelujah man what will he remove and
[1:33:00] destroyed yoke
[1:33:03] is by anointing of the world
[1:33:07] anointing of the world
[1:33:11] let's give an example
[1:33:13] when Elijah
[1:33:16] what God are offended because the
[1:33:20] children of Israel went back
[1:33:23] he went to the mountains
[1:33:28] he wanted to be taken by God
[1:33:31] but God told him
[1:33:37] this is
[1:33:57] there was transformation that took place
[1:34:00] there was some transformation that took
[1:34:03] place
[1:34:04] there was some change that took place in
[1:34:07] the life of religion
[1:34:09] there was something that took place in
[1:34:12] your Elijah's wife
[1:34:18] but when the Holy Ghost came up
[1:34:20] what happened to you all of us know the
[1:34:24] stories
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:32] but by the time when the mantle landed
[1:34:36] on him
[1:34:43] so he got transformed
[1:34:46] he got separated
[1:34:49] he killed all the auctions
[1:34:55] he kissed themselves their parents
[1:34:59] then he said let me follow me
[1:35:05] amen Amina but before that anointing
[1:35:10] or the Elisha having that leadership in
[1:35:13] his mind
[1:35:18] was he having that yeah
[1:35:22] all the change all the transformation
[1:35:24] took place after the anointed
[1:35:26] [Applause]
[1:35:29] what was the reason why he killed all
[1:35:32] those Hawks Bros
[1:35:40] so that when he moves
[1:35:45] when he first has challenges
[1:35:48] he will not be remembering
[1:35:51] when he sleeps hungry he will not recall
[1:35:57] when he faces a problem he will not
[1:36:01] recall the animals
[1:36:08] when the Holy Ghost is
[1:36:22] seek the Heavenly things
[1:36:26] about the Heavenly things
[1:36:29] I'm only those things will happen for
[1:36:33] that to seek every living where the Holy
[1:36:35] Ghost is upon us
[1:36:39] but if it is the flesh the flesh will
[1:36:43] drive us to think about the worldly
[1:36:45] things
[1:36:47] my brother my sister so when that
[1:36:51] anointing took place there was a great
[1:36:54] transformation in the Life
[1:36:57] there was a great change
[1:37:04] that there is a God in Israel
[1:37:09] he followed Elijah he followed him he
[1:37:14] got that double portions
[1:37:20] he forgot about the world Hallelujah
[1:37:56] amen amen
[1:37:58] yes
[1:38:01] what will remove
[1:38:05] if you want to escape from this world of
[1:38:08] confession
[1:38:12] to rule with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:16] my brother my sister
[1:38:19] this is the time for you to seek for the
[1:38:23] holy spirit
[1:38:24] because it is
[1:38:33] the Angel of Death to pass over you um
[1:38:44] we look at the first Exodus
[1:38:47] like the movement of Israel from Egypt
[1:38:49] to the promises
[1:38:57] when the angel of death came
[1:39:01] to do something
[1:39:11] like at the door at the entrance
[1:39:15] so that when the angel passes amen
[1:39:30] do we know that story
[1:39:33] by that time
[1:39:39] that was used to save the people of that
[1:39:43] time
[1:39:44] amen that was the thing is
[1:39:57] foreign
[1:41:01] foreign
[1:41:08] am I saying something
[1:41:12] hallelujah hallelujah so this is the
[1:41:15] silver our time
[1:41:19] without that
[1:41:21] idea my sister my brother yeah
[1:41:38] foreign
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:48] [Applause]
[1:42:03] [Applause]
[1:42:19] Hallelujah
[1:42:24] you know when you're anointed
[1:42:27] you only love righteousness
[1:42:30] you will love righteousness
[1:42:33] you will avoid wickedness
[1:42:38] but you love what oh yeah
[1:42:41] because the Holy Ghost is foreign
[1:42:47] and everyone with the Holy Ghost
[1:42:50] always does the right things
[1:42:58] amen Amina
[1:43:00] yes when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:43:03] you always keep the right thing
[1:43:08] and you'll do the right things every day
[1:43:16] that's in the Book of Psalms 105.
[1:43:20] you can read it from verse 15.
[1:43:24] that's not my anointed
[1:43:29] and do not harm to my prophets
[1:43:35] so we need to be anointed
[1:43:39] because that's the only thing that will
[1:43:42] destroy and remove the Earth
[1:43:44] it is
[1:44:39] foreign amen Mina save this great
[1:44:42] message that God has brought us
[1:44:47] joining
[1:44:49] unknown region a well-known region
[1:44:53] making a villager also to say something
[1:45:00] how great is that love
[1:45:03] that God passed through his message
[1:45:09] foreign
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:34] [Applause]
[1:46:07] Hallelujah Amina
[1:46:10] yeah but when you look
[1:46:12] when you hear people talk about it
[1:46:14] you feel not even to reach there is
[1:46:21] you love the place
[1:46:25] yeah you love the place
[1:46:28] you see if I still now Pastor let's go
[1:46:31] tomorrow
[1:46:39] I know he has good love
[1:46:41] with the other side there um
[1:46:48] he has good love with the camera
[1:46:54] amen but the anointing which we have
[1:46:58] received of him
[1:47:03] amen Amina
[1:47:06] and you need not any man to teach you
[1:47:11] when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:47:14] you will not need again any man to teach
[1:47:16] you
[1:47:18] God's cries with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:23] is
[1:47:36] there with you
[1:47:38] Hallelujah so we need really to seek
[1:47:42] foreign
[1:48:02] foreign
[1:48:24] in one of his sermons
[1:48:29] but small service
[1:48:32] but but small like baptism
[1:48:40] in 1950.
[1:48:45] if you can't really have that we see
[1:48:49] what the prophet said about that
[1:48:52] we see what he says about it
[1:48:57] and then we see where we are
[1:49:01] because
[1:49:03] the Holy Ghost
[1:49:06] is the only seal that can make us see
[1:49:10] him
[1:49:14] amen Amina
[1:49:18] I don't know whether the brother is
[1:49:20] there yes as is still looking at that
[1:49:23] we have also other quotations
[1:49:26] but I went first to read this one yeah
[1:49:31] because his son Billy Paul
[1:49:35] um wanted to go for the ministry
[1:49:39] but that day he wanted to be anointed
[1:49:44] amen but
[1:49:46] the prophet he was too happy
[1:49:50] when he had his son
[1:49:53] when you look at the message that he
[1:49:55] preached
[1:50:01] that was 1951.
[1:50:07] it's a bit long somewhere
[1:50:10] but I want to say something here
[1:50:50] foreign and in the last three days the
[1:50:55] Same by you there is going to be two
[1:50:57] classes of people
[1:51:01] that there is going to be how many
[1:51:03] classes
[1:51:11] and then the other group of people will
[1:51:14] be having the mark of the business
[1:51:19] now a question comes which class do you
[1:51:23] want to belongs
[1:51:26] do you want to belong in the class of
[1:51:29] the Seal of the Holy ghosts
[1:51:33] belong in that class
[1:51:43] even in this world we have two kingdoms
[1:51:48] we have one for God the kingdom of God
[1:51:54] we have also two groups of people the
[1:51:58] group of the peoples of the devil
[1:52:01] foreign
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:53:01] by God
[1:53:03] and they will never see life
[1:53:06] and they will never see salvation
[1:53:10] I'm sorry for them
[1:53:12] because they will go foreign
[1:53:44] amen Amina
[1:53:46] we talk of the world endings
[1:53:51] when the world ends in you see
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:58] oh by the time when you die go food day
[1:54:02] the world has come to an end from here
[1:54:04] and communication
[1:54:08] the time when I die in fact the world
[1:54:12] has come to announcement
[1:54:15] I pray that before that time comes
[1:54:22] by the holy ghosts
[1:54:28] because always
[1:55:06] are we
[1:55:10] waiting foreign
[1:55:14] amen I know many talk about the coming
[1:55:17] of the Lord
[1:55:18] my brother you can talk it a thousand
[1:55:21] and million trillion times
[1:55:25] let me tell you without the anointing of
[1:55:28] the Holy Spirit
[1:55:33] you're wasting your time
[1:55:37] Hallelujah
[1:55:38] you are wasting your time
[1:55:41] even if you preach how many times
[1:55:48] foreign
[1:56:26] those putting over a mark there
[1:56:30] my brother my sister
[1:56:33] preachers always preach
[1:56:36] but do you always get marked in that
[1:56:39] preaching
[1:56:42] do you always get sealed in that
[1:56:46] pressure
[1:56:48] because when they send the slaying
[1:56:51] Angels
[1:56:53] when they send those slaying Angel to
[1:56:57] the city
[1:56:58] they were instructed
[1:57:02] repentance
[1:57:23] [Music]
[1:57:36] hallelujah hallelujah but this is your
[1:57:39] opportunity and God is putting seals
[1:57:43] God is putting ourselves on you
[1:57:47] you're going to be silly okay God is
[1:57:51] putting a mark on you my brother my
[1:57:54] sister
[1:57:55] hope you'll not be one of them without
[1:57:59] him
[1:58:04] because that's what the scripture says
[1:58:07] maybe let me fly to that scriptures
[1:58:16] we want to read that and see
[1:58:19] what they were instructed to do
[1:58:24] but I want to start from verse 6.
[1:58:30] Young
[1:58:35] body mates and little children and women
[1:58:39] but come not near any man upon whom
[1:58:43] the mark
[1:58:44] upon whom is the mark and begin at My
[1:58:47] Sanctuary
[1:58:48] then they began at the ancient men which
[1:58:52] were before the house

[1:59:24] foreign
[2:00:06] Hallelujah
[2:00:09] say come not near any man with a mark
[2:00:18] but before they say destroy heartily or
[2:00:22] kill actually the old and young children
[2:00:25] and women and so others
[2:00:32] those are people without the mask
[2:00:37] even if you're a child
[2:00:39] and your parents are here are their
[2:00:42] Believers
[2:00:44] of the message
[2:00:49] what the message
[2:00:58] better you go and start afresh
[2:01:03] from the Scripture it does not segregate
