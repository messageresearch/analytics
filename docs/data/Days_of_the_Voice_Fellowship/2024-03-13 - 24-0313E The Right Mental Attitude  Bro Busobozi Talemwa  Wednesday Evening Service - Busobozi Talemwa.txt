whatever you've laid on My Heart Lord I'm nothing and I do not know even how to bring it to your people I'm confident in your abilities if your spirit can come this evening you will make a difference in our lives come and have your way in Jesus name amen amen amen I would like to invite you now to your Bibles please we are reading out of the book of Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 and uh we will be reading from vers 21 amen we had a lot of testimonies for Sunday last week how many were blessed on Sunday such moments are usually rare and when the Holy Spirit comes down like that you want to be sure that you get your blessing before you leave the service trusted this evening give us a little more of him amen we are reading verses 21 brother Prince was restored faith on Tabernacle on Sunday and I heard from him he said it was wonderful there Benjamin you were there is that true that we are blessed too amen so we are reading verses 21 vers 24 if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that he put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness for amen amen you may be seated I do have a lot to talk about this evening so I'm trusting that you kindly give me your undivided attention that we you don't do a lot of movements that we may be able to in the end to learn something so sometimes forget our live uh congregation so we send you our greetings we ask that the Lord will bless you this evening and when people here say Amen you also say Amen how many are prepared their Amen in the praise God so I'm going to speak on a subject which I believe will help a lot of young people so if it blesses you as usual you kindly share the service service with other young people I do have not prepared to preach that much just a few thoughts I need to share about the right mental attitude okay isn't that what you interpreted isn't that the right attitude or the right mind and I don't know I don't know you will find the right right mental attitude what is mental in Uganda obongo no that's brains that's brains that is head so so you have to find the right word mental what is mental somebody help us ah that is close yes yes I always thought you were the best interpreter now what is happening today the right mental attitude I think that is perfect that is good that's a good one now that's really what I want the subject I'm going to talk about but I'll be talking about different things I've been waiting on you are you ready okay if you're ready can you put that picture for us and brother Isaac you you I sent you something with that picture as well if you can be able to get it and put it up for the people online there's something I want to illustrate for them before we continue because if I get started I may not be able to get into that and I hope you don't disappoint me because you told me it's going to work okay I mean brother Isaac you have it already Okay so I'll just continue um there are three Realms of man you are a Tran being you are really three in one brother Marvin whatever I'm saying I want people to see it to make sure that happens shortly if you can so uh usually what we call man is what we see but that is the outer man that's the body and each of each each part of man has uh different gats so the outside part of man the body has five gats which we call five senses and that is SE the sense of the sense of feel smell hear and taste now all these are five GS or five senses that uh bring things into that man and now that all happens actually on the outside body on the outside man but you see there is another man who is the innermost being who is the real you and now that is the soul I know brother B in the beginning he said it's a spirit but later on as he progressed in Revelation he said no it is the soul and many Pentecostal still teach that you know the inner man is the spirit but the inner man is not a spirit the inner man is the soul and now in the soul is only one gate and that gate is either Faith or doubt and now when you believe you have faith in the word of God that gate will open all the blessings of the word every promise of of God in your life but if you doubt the word of God then that gate will open in a lot of things that are for the doubter so I believer should have the Gate of faith in their but you see there is the inner man that's the innermost man the soul and then the outer man is the spirit the body but then we have the inner man that is the spirit and that's the one I want us to dwell on the one I want us to dwell on today the Inner Man the spirit also has five gates just like the outside man the body now the first gate is called memory the other is called reasoning the other is called affection and then imagination un conscious and we will get into those things in details later on shortly so we see that all these five gats in your inner man are in your spirit now I have another word for Spirit we may want to call it intelligence we may want to call it mind or brain if you will but really we find that you see the man's mind is the man's Spirit you see are you following me now praise the praise the Lord do you understand what I'm talking about we all have those things I'm not talking about things from the Moon I'm not talking about zombies I'm not even talking about aliens I'm talking about human beings that's how our makeup whether we know it or we do not know praise the name of the Lord and now when man is born man is born with all the three Body Soul Spirit and the moment you come into the world you know you realize that you already uh have in your spirit memory affection imagination conscious and reasoning five G okay finally you you you overcame brother God bless so right over there point on the Spirit Room brother right there the yellow that's memory affection imagination conscious and reasoning but you see out of man there are many things that come at him that come to attack him pull him down to defeat him but you see those things cannot come into the man without using the gats they will use the gats for example last will come in and when last comes it will first come and attack the body and when it attacks the body it will have to have a gate it has used maybe the the Gate of taste maybe the Gate of feeling maybe the Gate of smell maybe the Gate of sin you know you see something and you become so lustful you know you you hear something and you know like that's why it is wrong to hear the wrong kind of music that's why it matters what we hear what we see what we smell what we you know we taste it is very important you know because those are gates to your soul you know if you close those Gates then your soul will be protected but you see before you reach you arrive at your soul the if those Gates on the body have opened up then you will find that the GS on the spirit also you know will open up because you smelled something or tested something or saw something then you begin to imagine it you see a right a wrong kind of video and then even if you are no longer seeing it the moment you open the gate of your eyes then now even if you close that gate and you see now I don't want to see you cannot un see because it has already entered now it goes into another another another Realm Of You the real of your spirit and now it will go in your imagination and then you begin to imagine the things you have seen you begin to see pictures the same same things you saw with your eyes you begin to see it in your [Applause] spirit you begin to imagine it and you can even remember it can go and be deposited in your memory even for [Applause] years and you remember what you saw many years ago and the moment you remember it it takes you back again in the feeling you have all these are interconnected and now you know when now you open the the gates of your spirit it comes straight at your soul and it begins to bring you doubt you begin to doubt the word of God instead of believing and then that's why you find many people backsliding someone who was in the church but then they they reach a moment they feel they are no longer Believers but you find that they had opened all these Gates when you open your Gates it opens you open it to a lot of spirits and when all those demons and spirits come in you they begin to eat up on you like cancer they eat you up they eat you up slowly but slow by slowly and before you know it you know you no longer believe you now have doubt on the word when someone reads you the word you're like I don't really see it that way I don't agree I don't accept because you have doubt and what brings doubt is because you open these other gates in your spirit but but but you see there is something very special about a be a child of God not a Believer but a child of God are you hearing me when do you believe praise the name of the Lord when do you believe do you believe before you are born answer me when do you believe you believe long before you were born when did you believe answer me Church you believe before when do you believe when he became of age how how did you believe after hearing H now we are coming after you hear the word then you you agree with it when you heard it you believe it you know the Bible says thatth we believe we hear with our ears that's now the Gate of hearing and we believe with our hearts right because when you open those Gates it goes straight on your heart and then you believe it and then you confess with your mouth so it it comes in your ears all the way to your heart and it comes back again on your mouth so you believe after hearing but when did you become a child of God yes my brother you be oh praise the name of the Lord you didn't even become a child of God you always a child of God before you were even born you were in the mind of God before the foundation of you are only come here in a space of time to be manifested to prove to the devil that you were always a child of God and that's why you see some people they come in the church and backslide and they never come back again but there are those who come and backslide and they will think that I never come back again but somehow they will always come back again why because there is something pulling on you in your heart amen among all children of God there is something we call a seed gen you know the the predestinated seed Gene as long as that Gene is in your heart you can never fall away from grace are you understand what I'm preaching you can never fall Away From Grace a mango cannot fall so far from the tree even when you fell away by the natural birth you were born in because now you need to put on your spiritual thinking capes today so you can understand what we're talking about because the way the nature we were born we were born in a nature that is sinful we were born you know with all our gates open to a lot of things our spirit was a wrong kind of spirit our our body was a wrong kind of course it's a wrong kind of body and in our hearts we had unbelief just like everybody else everyone is born like that but there is something special about you and me that we had a seed gen you cannot kill that seed Gene the devil cannot remove that he may take you in the world you can do a lot of things the world you can regret about what you did but one thing you will never fall Away From [Music] Grace because somehow when you hear the word the word will pull you back again to come where you belong a seat of God belongs in the house of God the seed of God must believe the word of God the seed of God can Never Fall Away a child of God can never go to hell this is truth this the truth I'm speaking this evening not very many people know it not very many people know it and even those who know it they know it unconsciously but we know it because of this precious message and that's why we ought to shout amen when it is being spoken I want you to imagine and think about it critically that you can never go to hell think about it that you can never go to hell you come to church because you're fearing to go to hell you are coming to church because the seed gen is drawing you here amen even when you do the wrong things the seed G when it hears the word it be pulled back again to the word let me tell you many of us even if he wanted to do the wrong things God will not allow us to do them not because we don't have the ability but because we have a SE in us that keeps pulling on us you know In the Flesh this flesh is sinful the Bible actually say there is there is another law working in this flesh amen there is another law completely different from the law of the word it's different from the law of the spirit and when you receive the Holy Ghost there is another law working in your soul and the moment that law is in there it will colonize and overcome the law in your flesh in that the flesh will have all the desires but there is something that happens that the law of the spirit in your soul will close all the gates Hallelujah it will be amen it will be a protector he'll be your God Amen to protect all the gates and not allow you to open any gate amen when you try to open the gate of seeing wrong things that law will tell you come on close that g Hallelujah and you find yourself closing the where if you want you know to hear the wrong kind of things you know that love the spirit will tell you come and close that gate and you I can't hear that do you know a Believer when even if you sat in even if you are renting around a place where they play wrong kind of music and you they make you hear it by [Music] force do you know you can't find peace until you actually go away from there and find another house you can't find peace because the law of God in you will keep telling you close that gate close that gate until I can't stay here if you if you that's what happens for us not to fulfill the law of the flesh the the desires of the flesh otherwise if our gates were open then we like others would fulfill the desires of the flesh praise the name of the Lord so when I talk about the right mental attitude I'm really referring to the spirit now the spirit man and I want us today to talk about the spirit man when we come into to Christ we come with a wrong kind of mind our spirit is not good our spirit is confused our spirit is sinful our spirit has bad bad conscience you know wrong imagination wrong affections bad memory and when we come to the Lord the Bible says and be not conformed to the world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect and with the will of God how can you prove what is the will of God what is acceptable to God what is perfect to God what is good to God how can you prove it by transformation each of us has to go through a transformation amen our mind has to be renewed in Ezekiel 11:9 he says and I'll give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will make I will take the Stony heart out of their flesh and I will give them an heart of Flesh that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances and do them that they shall be my people and I will be their God now did you hear that if you don't have a new heart a new mind a new spirit you cannot keep the statutes and the ordinances of God there is something I want us to learn today you see the problem that we have we have many uh people who are intending to be Believers but they cannot be able to keep up with the life because they do not have the ability if you understand say Amen to live a Christian life to live a life that is pleasing to God you must attain the ability look at a look at for instance um a pig the pig does not have the ability to live like sheep if you clean it up you wash it properly and you perfume it and you tell now little piggy I've built for you a beautiful house I want you to stay in here it's a nice glass house don't you ever go back into that M do you hear me little piggy will say yes I agree it's a LW to the little piggy and the pig will keep that law for as long as you have locked the door are you hearing but make when it rains and all mud is out there little piggy will be inside but dying to go out there I wish I wish I can get an opportunity to go and do those things look at other people the they mingling with the and the I'm missing out I'm missing out the the Sheep will tell the other the pig can't you see where where we it is clean and we enjoying ourselves put a song and the Sheep will begin singing I'm no longer a slave to I am a child God and the pig will be like I don't enjoy this music my heart and my makeup and my nature is out there please let me go he will try even to break the glass and the moment the door is open the at the earliest opportunity this little pig will rush and go into the slope and enjoy because that's his nature are you hearing me a True Believer can never be that one if you are like that it simply means the nature in you is not yet changed you need a change of Nature and a change the Bible says here you cannot fulfill the law of [Music] Christ you cannot keep his ordinances if he has not put a new heart in you and then he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts he sping you are you hearing me otherwise you are just aie obeying the laws but you don't have the ability to live a Christian Life and if you're doing the works of the law you can never please God because those are your own works of right you know you dress well you don't dress miniskirts sisters you don't dress trousers you don't use makeup you know Brothers you don't do those and you wear as if they powered you and you begin walking like a girl because your nature is not yet changed but you see why you desire those things it's because your nature is not yet changed but if your nature is changed you cannot desire in your heart those things but now listen on the other side are you hearing me if you do these things in obedience to God's laws still it does not please God and there are many believers who are like that they are believers because they dress well they don't drink they don't smoke they come to church every service and because of that they Believers and they have never had an experience and they have never changed but they Believers by name but these kind of Believers at the earliest opportunity you will find them behaving like the other people in the world and many of us we are surprised I thought the brother was a Believer don't don't even say you thought he was never a Believer to begin he was simply following laws and rules and when you ever feel that this message this word of God is rules and laws because you have never had an experience but the moment you have an experience your right your mental attitude about the word will change to fulfill the word will be so easy because it is not you do fulfill the word it is Christ in you fulfilling his own way it's a new nature a new life in you oh may God give us a new mind we are all born with a perverted mind we were all born in sin we were all born lasting after the things of the world everybody lasted after the only thing that keeps many Believers and I said Believers in qutes the only things that keeps many Believers soal Believers from doing the things that they used to do is good parents solid Society cultures in our culture we don't behave like that you don't do that and then you don't do those things if you're born in a good family or maybe your church is very strict and the teach or maybe even religion religion for example Muslims dress dress they cover their body because of their religion but the Bible tells us women should dress modestly but there are many even believers who are not dressing good yet Muslims are covering their whole body so I'm showing you that it is possible to to to do the laws of the word because you doing it religiously or you fulfilling your cultural norms that does not please God that does not prove that you have a renewed mind to try and acquire the promises of of the word you would need to fulfill the law of God which is the word of God no no man in their natural mind can fulfill the law of Christ you didn't get it let me man in his natural [Music] mind the law of Christ no man no man in his natural mind so you have to lose your mind to fulfill the law of Christ the mind you were born with is not the right mind you have to renew your mind all right I know you are listening in and that is good but I want I want this to stay with you we would need to have a new mind we would need to be you know how can a man who already born have a new mind when he's alive already that man would need to die first and then be born again that's why the Bible says in the book of you know John that he must be born again he must be born again it is not may be born again can be born again he says must be born again are you hearing what I'm preaching brother you must be born again if you remain the way the are you can never please God the me I'm you will never see God you have to be born again but to be born again you need to die first and what can you do to be to to to be to die that's the problem many Believers don't want to die they don't want to die to their to their original Natural Life they want to remain the way they were are that is why I believe that when you become a Believer even some cultural Traditions have to die as long as your tradition is against or contrary to the world then it must die or you can never born again you find someone keeping a shrine someone keeping a shrine behind the house but they are saying they Christians they reading the Bible some of them are even preaching how can you prove to us that you can amen keep your culture of having a shrine and worshiping the small God and worshiping your idol and you are born again you have not died to begin with you have to die to those things you have to die to your mind you have to die to your thoughts you have to die to your way you have to die to everything when a man dies he does not die halfway you die fully and you are buried but this case the Bible says when we are bued in Christen We rise up again amen the Bible says all things have passed away behold all things are new we dead to the old man we born again to the new man our mind has been renewed but the problem with the younger generation they don't want to renew their that's why you preach the word and they will never do those things they will remain at saying amen but they don't have the power to do that when they hear them they say from today I'm going to do this but when they go from the church from that day they will do the way they were doing it what is the problem they want to do it but they don't have the power they don't have the ability the ability of fulfilling the ways of God is only in dying is in being renewed The Nature has to be change Take This Heart of the pig Hallelujah and give it a new heart take the spirit of a pig and give it a new spirit and then put in a spirit Hallelujah of God in there and then notice it will live a different life the desires will change permanently Brethren it is not difficult to live a Christian life but the trouble of it is many try to live a Christian Life with their old nature that's the problem your Nature has to die tell your neighbor your Nature has to die your Nature has to die how does it die you submit yourself before God say Here I Am Lord I I I admit I am born in sin my nature is right Lord kill me where do you die you die at the altar that's where death happens and whenever we come in the house of God we are coming to die Paul said I Die daily you have to die every day that's why you have to read the word of God every day that's why you have to pray every day because we die daily if you try to be a believer with your original nature that will show fail it will fail you cannot do it because that nature was created rather was born in a fallen [Music] State because of sin we were we were born by last of the flesh all of us all of you we born that way and that is why sin RS in our body that is the reason why you want to do good but evil is PR so how can you overcome that the have to be closed but the gates for them to be closed you will need something powerful on the control center you need a controller on the control center where is the control center of your kingdom right there on your soul amen if Jesus is Seated on your soul then he's controlling you then he's leading you and how can Jesus sit there by filling you with the Holy Ghost how do you receive the Holy Spirit you receive the Holy Spirit by Believing by faith but he first he said I'm going to put a new heart what will the new heart do heart will accept the word it is a good atmosphere and then he will put a new spirit and today we are speaking about the spirit when he puts a new spirit in you all the doors cannot open the doors of your spirit cannot open to the wrong side and once he has protected you then now he himself will come and take the seat on the throne of your heart now people ask me questions does it does it mean the desire on my flesh the desires of the world go away does it mean last is no longer in my body does it mean that I I don't have any even a piece of hatred do mean all these things are gone no but they are on the outside of you but the gates if they were open those things will come right back to you and when you receive the Holy Spirit he keeps all the gates closed he gives you what we call selfcontrol you are he's controlling from the Tower of your heart well if you listen to wrong music the holy spirit will tell you shut shut that door shut that door shut that door and he walk away from that kind of and when you walk away you protected yourself from many many things but was it your action it was a work of the Holy Spirit you you you will not you will go to your page to your computer to your iPad to your phone to go and watch wrong things and the Holy Spirit will tell you close that g close that G but now a Christian who does not have the Holy Spirit doesn't have that power are you following me you know I'm preaching this because I want you to see the need to have the Holy Spirit you will be a Christian you believe everything every Everybody believes you agree with the word of God but within you you do not have Christ on the control center of your heart so you will do wrong things at the earliest opportunity he will have mercy on those have mercy on let me do it and I will repent you have never been changed you've never been reborn there's a song that talks about Grace says God's grace taught to fear you know when you come to him even when you come next to sin you it brings a lot of fear on your you will feel uncomfortable how many have ever felt that right there that is the holy spirit he he creat that fear in you you can't do that you can't do that and let me do it you cannot and then you will walk away I can't do it what happened he's on the control tower the man on the control tower he's controlling you it's not that he's controlling us we also have our will to make but now that's what I'm talking about today our will our mind so enclosed in with his we agree with him in Genesis before sin came in would say that God left Adam to name all the animals Adam would say it's a lion God would say amen that's right because that's the mind of God Adam did not create it it was the mind of God but Adam agreed with God because his mind was one with God the things you do all the things you do you have already done them in your mind before you do them in the and that's why the law we have received oh my may you receive this today the law we have received is not the law of sin and death it's not the law like that of the Old Testament the law of Works rules of do and don'ts the message is not that way the law we have now is the law of spirit of life when that amen Jesus Christ the spirit of him when he he dwells in you he quickens your mot body and he brings your B unto subjection whereby in the Old Testament they were supposed to do an act and then they are sinners but here today before even the ACT has been done we already arrested already arrested spiritual law it works within our members it works within our souls that's why I said before you do anything you have already done it and the Bible says when a man looks at a woman to last after he has already committed in his heart with her how come yet in the Old Testament it was not that way it was until he has done the act so the difference here is the one today is more powerful amen it arrests us before we actually sin it brings righteousness that's why he said here let me read this portion again for you and he put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness true Holiness is not our works but true Holiness is his Works in us when a man has no Holy Spirit he has no power to do the works of the Holy Ghost that is doing his own works wish to go a filthy rugs so you have many believers who are actually before God not holy through Holiness and through righteousness is from the working of the holy spirit in you so now the question is what can I do if I don't have the power to live right seek the Holy Spirit come before God reverently go in a personal altar somewhere go somewhere and pray because you each of us know each other we know ourselves you know whether you are born again or not you know whether you filled the holy ghost or not you cannot be born and you don't know I am born and and you are born and you all of us so if you born again by the spirit of God you know praise God and so if you need to amen live that kind of life and you realize you're living a defeated Christian life you don't have to struggle about anything you don't even have to come and do this halfhazard prayers when the pastor preaches and the word touches you because you have a seed gen of of God in you like I believe it Lord from today I'm not going to do that anym you are a liar you know you will do it again stop promising God that you will not do anything the more you do that the more God looks on and laughs at you because God knows within you you have no power to do that if you did why did he die he died in order Hallelujah he died in order to give us the power he died Amen to give us the ability oh come on listen to me amen he died to give us the ability to live a Christian Life he died to give us the ability to do the things we could not do before he died to make us more than conquerors and his death has done that for us because when he died he rose again and when he rose again he went up to heaven and then he came back again in the form of the Holy Ghost so what is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the mighty conqueror living in the heart of a Believer and if you do not have the Holy Spirit you have no power to overcome you will always live at defeated Life as [Music] a and what you can promise God from today I'm no longer doing this and as a human being according to your resilience and strength you will try you will do it step for a while and then you say this is too much for me and some even leave church they said these things are difficult your standard is too high that's why when you bring new people in the church pointing them to the rules of dos and don'ts they have the power within them to do it they don't so what do they need they need to be pointed to Christ Christ is the word Christ is the Holy Ghost if if new people can come in then you know come at the alter of the word the outter prayer you know what do what happen is God will fill them with the Holy Spirit change them permanently and they will change their appetites they will change their friends they will change their circles they change their mind their thought why it is not you doing it it's not a pastor doing it it is Jesus Christ on the throne of their heart and that's why when a church when you're preaching to to people who don't have the Holy Spirit that church is very difficult even to Pastor a church of people who the majority when they don't have the Holy Spirit it is a very difficult Church to Pastor I'm telling you because everybody are pushing them pulling them you're forcing them even to come to church you're forcing them you're pushing them even on the small small things praying they can't even have family let me tell you if you have the Holy Spirit you can't sleep without praying so some of you who are asking do I have or do I not let me tell you if you are sleeping without praying you don't have the Holy Spirit and you you are in a family and you don't have family alar you don't pray you don't read the word you don't have an in your home which means you don't have the Hool spirit so what then do you need to do come and ask God to fill you with the Holy Spirit he fills the holy spirit with those who desire it I'm imagining is in somebody and somebody comes to church and the word is going on and they sleeping think about it that may be difficult for you let me give you another example think about this someone has a spirit football in him and he goes to a football and begins have you ever seen anyone do that I've never seen anyone they all on fire removing their it's a spirit of football in the same way if you have the spirit of Christ in you will your team if have the Holy Spirit when you come to church you will not be cold you will not be lukewarm you will not be indifferent I'm sorry I'm making very hard statement when you come to church and the only thing you do is just to be there even saying amen is very heavy your is coming from very far it means your mind is not r it means you are still heavy you need to be filled in your house let me tell you have the desire if you know you are not filled in your heart come out of your comfort zone go somewhere and pray it's not just to come and preach to you and then you receive no go go and seek him like like this man Jacob he wrestled all night said leave me he said I'll not leave you until you fill me and change my name change my name that's when I will leave you bless me that's when I will leave you let me tell you you have to go somewhere and pray me I mean you know just believe the word then don't worry you have the Holy Spirit it is beyond that the devil also believes the word you know that the Bible says you believe in one God and it says even the devil believes it and even [Music] trembles now you believe but you don't even some believer don't even tremble but the devil believes and it begins because of the word so believing is not enough after believing then you need to take another step amen of asking God to come in your life and fill you with his life you have to have an experience you have to know for sure that I have received the Holy Ghost in my soul and the Holy Ghost is not emotional because you were emotional and then you was fill no the Holy Ghost is not emotional it's not even speaking Tong it's not even prophesying it's not falling down the Holy Ghost is not those things although when he comes those things can happen and always those things happen but the holy spirit is a life when it comes in your life your life will change your mind shall be renewed you receive a new mental attitude and told us here that when you have a right mental attitud the word of God praise the name of the Lord there are many things talk about on this subject but let us see how the holy spirit will lead us in the next few moments I'll close in the next few moments now let us go through these things a little uh what is a new spirit um first of all we have seen the five gats which one of them is your memory now when you get a new memory you will you will only remember what God speaks of you are you hearing me all things have passed away to you all things are new praise God your mistakes your sins and the past are behind you like God you forgot all I'm not hearing any amen like God you forgot all of your past you know when you come and repent your sins before God God forgets it how many knew that say amen God forgets it now when the devil the says the devil is the accus of the Brethren so when the Devil comes to accuse you before God God will say I don't remember what did he do he did this and this I don't remember but now when you receive a new mind your memory will also change it will be how many know the memories in in a laptop or computer we even know memory card in our phones you know you can change that memory you can remove that memory and you put a new memory now when God gives you a new spirit he changes your memory he removes your old memory and puts a new memory whereby you don't remember the things you did in your natural memory you remember but in your new memory someone will tell you come on we used to do this I'm sorry I am a new man I don't even know how to do that thing anymore because I I am changed praise the name of the Lord number two you are affections affection is a feeling of liking care or fness for someone or something you know affection some you know the things you care about you know when you he oh so and so will know that I've done this and you'll feel bad you know I like so so much this thing I like you know I like something or someone so much you know I'm so fond of this so F of that some people are so fond of alcohol other are so fond of you know immorality affection other people are so fond of movies you know you find that so and so Loves movies so much they will watch until past midnight until and especially Our Generation you find younger people they don't sleep at night because they are watching films or they doing those kind of things and that's why they become so lazy during day time they can't do anything sensible because that that Spirit has already taken all the strength out of them he created night for sleep and for work but they so fond of things they're doing at night and they can't sleep and then during day they can't work they can't even think of ideas to to generate income you know others they so F of games even when he's in church his hands are moving the pastor is preaching but really his hands is already doing the games the pastor saying hallelujah his hands already doing the I hope I don't have anyone like that here today they so fond of that your affection is towards those [Music] things that is a clear sign you you don't have even a new spirit because when it gives you a new spirit your affection changes Colossians 3:22 says set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead tell your neighbor you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God praise the name of the Lord you are dead and your life is hid in Christ with Christ in God set your things set your affection on things about what what do you cherish let me take a moment I know today I know I was going to talk things that like are really Discerning your lives I wanted to take it slowly I wanted to think about this where is your affection where is your affection what is it that you put your heart [Music] to they have put their affection on money others and family things that are not seen not seen but they have put their affection on those you can't even put your affection on things above you can't even think about the supernatural things you can't think about the things of God that's why they never pray never find for God never read the Bible if I ask here how many have finished this Bible how many will raise up their hands and one Muslim said Christians are people who never read the it's what we believe it's what makes us who we are but very few Christians take the time to sit down and take the Bible and read it where is our affection when he gives you a new spirit he changes your affection he changes also your imagination The Faculty imagination is a faculty or action of forming new ideas or images or concepts of external objects not present to the senses so your thinking capability for new to form new ideas you imagine things you know uh there are many scriptures I would have read about imagination but in Proverbs 12 it says 20 deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil and so and and God in Genesis 65 he says and God saw that the wickedness of a man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually so you see this is after after the sin came into the world so man continue to imagine evil let me ask you a question today when you sit there what do you always imagine I even know of people who you know they repeatedly become sad you know some people have that kind of spirit they're happy happy happy and then you find them like that you one time I asked one young lady I said tell me what goes on in your mind said nothing said tell me and then after she said I be imagining bad things what if this happens what that happens I will do this I it's a wrong spirit because they don't have a new spirit your old nature of your old spirit gives you wrong imaginations you begin imagining wrong things bad things you never imagine good after sin came into the world the Bible says the hearts of people continually imagined evil their imagination the thoughts of their heart was evil continuous and God wanted to destroy all of them do you know that your bad your evil imagination can actually make God destroy you but you have no power until God gives you a new spirit when he gives you a new spirit you begin imagining new things is completely different you are no longer imagining evil but you are imagining right things what you will open your gate the Gate of imagination too if I I put it to [Music] myself can I reach out to 10 Souls every month I can 10 Souls every month and then you'll pick up a book I'm going to begin writing them I reach out to somebody give them a tra invite them to church teach them tell them about the message what I know and then I invite them to church and I write their name and contact and I'll keep contacting them it's an imagination you tell me to prove it I just imagined it right now you to can imagine things like that what can you do for the if your affection is set things above then your imagination is going to be a good imagination but you find younger men women if you were to oh God have mercy if you were to just brother let me see through the door of your imag that silence means it all your imagination what are you imagining God sees everything God knows everything and doesn't want you to be that he wants you to have a new imagination and when it gives you a new spirit you have a new imagination I'll take two more and then I'll close conscience if he gives you a new spirit he gives you a new conscience conscious is a passionate moral sense of right and wrong [Music] viewed as acting as a guide to one's Behavior the Bible speaks about people having their conscience seared with a hot iron but to the pure he said all things are pure to the def and and believing is nothing pure and even their mind and conscious is defiled the speaks the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times shall depart from the faith giving he to seducing spirits and of devils speaking Li in hypocrisy having their conscience seed with a h iron do you know that when human being can give himself to seducing spirits to wrong doctrines after he has departed from the faith and he listen listen don't miss this and his conscience will actually be seed with a hot iron whereby he does not have a sense of right and wrong have you ever seen people who murder others recently actually sister Esther you know called in and told me someone came into her house with a panga broke into the house she was outside and when when she entered in the person tried to pull her in so that he can cut her so that he can cut her but somehow you know God helped her and she pulled herself out and then she shouted and people came to help and the man ran away and threw the panga down what do you think that kind of man is conscious does he have a conscious any his cons his conscious is seed you can cut your neck and not feel a thing may God help us that we will have a sense of right and wrong that our conscious will always lead and guide us to actually make the right decision and in in the the the in mark 2:6 it says but there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts and this is I wanted to show you the last one here about reasoning logical thinking about something in a logical or a sensible way many times we take reasoning instead of Faith do you know that we are born man is born in such a way that he wants to reason everything you find the scribes what kill the scribes and the Pharisees and made them not see Christ was their reasoning every time Christ came to them they started reasoning reasoning but when we receive the Holy Spirit he you know God loves wants us to be foolish you are quiet because you don't believe that let me read that for you in first Corinthians 1:27 but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world confound the things which are might the Way Up Is Down you know your reasoning will not get you anywhere does it mean that we should never use our reasoning we should reason through the filter of the word but where you begin to reason and out reason God thinking you are sensible that's where reasoning fails when a man receives a new spirit they receive new reasoning now these are things that we can each of us relate in our personal lives and I pray that after we we have seen the state of life where we are then you can know how to direct your prayers to God I I'll finish this later on get get to other Courts for now let us stand and if you have you know after hearing the things that have been spoken today I [Music] wonder what do you think of it would you want God to come and perit through your heart would you want him to give you a right mental attitude towards his word give you a new spirit that's my desire today if you like me you can just lift up your hand and we'll pray together Lord Jesus there many people here Lord raising up their hands no doubt and maybe online as well my prayer Lord is you will come and visit them let their mind be renewed give them a new Mind by giving them a new spirit Lord Jesus forgive those that have lived outside of their abilities because it's been Pride that has kept us into those uh uh those places instead of coming and asking you to feel us because if you feel us then we can live like you we can have a mind like yours you can have a good conscience you can have a good memory you can have a new spirit Lord where our life will be an example to many feel each of us father I pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ create in me a clean oh God and renew a right Spirit within created me created in me I cleaner oh oh
