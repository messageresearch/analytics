[36:01] Jesus Christ

[36:10] this will be a blessing to all of us
[36:14] I'm speaking to you out of Hebrews
[36:17] chapter 6 verse 13 20.
[36:20] [Music]
[36:25] foreign
[36:32] for when God gave
[36:34] so when God made promise to Abraham
[36:37] because you could swear by no greater he
[36:40] swear by himself saying surely blessing
[36:44] our blessed thee and multiplying I'll
[36:46] multiply thee and so after he had
[36:50] patiently endured he obtained a promise
[36:52] for men verily swear by the great by the
[36:57] greater and an oath for confirmation is
[36:59] to them and end of all Strife where in
[37:04] God willing more abundantly to show unto
[37:07] The Heirs of the promise the
[37:09] immutability of his cancer confirmed it
[37:11] by an earth that by two immutable things
[37:15] in which it was impossible for God to
[37:17] lie we might have a strong consolation
[37:20] who have fled for Refuge to lay hold
[37:23] upon the Hope set before us
[37:26] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[37:29] Soul both sure and steadfast and which
[37:33] entereth into that within the Veil
[37:36] and and which entereth into that within
[37:39] the veil whether the Forerunner is for
[37:41] for us entered
[37:43] even Jesus Medan high priest for a
[37:47] Forever After the order of Melchizedek
[37:51] Buffet
[38:51] amen
[39:30] we ask that the presence of God will
[39:32] just come
[39:34] be pleased with our fellowship tonight
[39:38] you know that the hearts desire of your
[39:40] children
[39:46] and even those that would stream this
[39:49] service
[39:57] and that your word is
[40:03] impossible for it to failure
[40:07] and it is also unchanging
[40:10] when you gave it once
[40:14] it is
[40:17] now may you come and dwell in the
[40:20] presence of your children
[40:22] let words be spoken from your throne
[40:26] that will encourage them
[40:32] first moment now to you
[40:35] take me out of the way Lord
[40:38] you speak to them
[40:41] in Jesus name
[40:43] amen amen amen please be seated
[40:50] I'm speaking to you I'm still continuing
[40:52] on our subject which we spoke on last
[40:55] the message of the hour
[41:00] I'm speaking on the anchor
[41:04] praise the name of the Lord
[41:10] amen Amina
[41:13] if you have a neighbor near you tell
[41:15] them the anchor
[41:17] the anchor in Anger now this is a very
[41:21] important thing
[41:23] because I believe that in every age
[41:28] God has given an anchor
[41:33] the people of that age
[41:36] and without an anchor
[41:39] the Sheep is in trouble
[41:43] is a tool lowered into the bottom of
[41:46] water to keep the sheep in its place
[41:51] [Music]
[41:53] this is especially during a bad weather
[41:56] you know bad weather conditions or
[41:58] during a storm
[42:02] or maybe a typhoon
[42:05] and so the anchor secures those aboard
[42:09] the ship
[42:09] [Music]
[42:14] the ship does not sink
[42:18] it's usually a chain
[42:21] and this chain you know you know it is
[42:24] thrown into the water
[42:26] and it goes all the way to the bottom
[42:30] of the water body let us say maybe it is
[42:35] [Music]
[42:37] and so the anchor is very important
[42:41] on a boat or on a ship rather
[42:44] and without it
[42:46] the sale is very dangerous
[42:53] and so tonight I want us to talk about
[42:56] the Anchorage
[42:58] and I want to talk about this in
[43:00] connection with the message that we have
[43:02] received in this generation
[43:08] when the boat there is a lot of bad
[43:12] weather conditions
[43:14] and you know you see the bot of life
[43:18] our life is almost in danger
[43:21] and you see that has been the case in
[43:24] every generation
[43:27] people have been in danger
[43:30] in danger of death in danger of losing
[43:34] it and the only
[43:48] [Music]
[44:33] that our life is not secure without
[45:08] [Applause]
[45:28] I was reading something and there is
[45:30] this one Reverend Johnson he said
[45:32] something very stunning for me I thought
[45:34] I should quote it for you you know
[45:36] [Music]
[45:42] figuratively of the Christian's
[45:44] confidence
[45:49] having security of Hope in Christ
[45:54] [Music]
[45:56] this symbolizes
[45:58] [Music]
[46:04] steady fastness
[46:07] and stability
[46:10] so as a sheep itself when at an anchor
[46:14] so are we
[46:25] is a symbol of us being grounded in
[46:28] Christ when we experience crisis
[46:34] chaotic conditions
[46:37] are you hearing me
[46:39] disturbing difficulties
[46:46] all these things in our lives when we
[46:51] experience them
[46:52] we have an anchor
[46:56] now when when all these waves and the
[47:00] storms of life when they come to eat
[47:04] if you
[47:08] [Applause]
[47:14] but the lives will not be lost
[47:17] because
[47:20] I am telling you there is nothing in
[47:23] this life
[47:25] that can help us if we don't have this
[47:27] anchors
[47:30] there are times when you're rich in life
[47:32] and you are so disappointed or depressed
[47:36] [Music]
[47:38] when you don't have a meaning to life
[47:41] [Music]
[47:43] when you try to chase after things and
[47:45] it seems it is not working out
[47:49] when you are working on something and it
[47:52] is not progressing
[47:55] when you ask for things and it seems God
[47:58] is not answering you
[48:01] and when you find yourself in a place
[48:05] when it seems you are all by yourself
[48:09] if you were disappointed
[48:13] let me tell you you need an anchor
[48:54] [Applause]
[49:12] We Trust in our church
[49:37] [Applause]
[50:14] Hallelujah I want
[51:15] foreign
[52:12] because they wanted to find other
[52:14] solutions to their problems
[52:27] I want to read you this Hebrews this
[52:30] scripture in in the Amplified version of
[52:32] the Bible
[52:34] yes it says for when God made the
[52:37] promise to Abraham yes
[52:45] by himself
[52:47] since he had no one Greater by whom to
[52:50] swear
[52:53] saying I will surely bless you and I
[52:56] will surely multiply you Gaga
[53:00] and so having patiently waited
[53:03] [Music]
[53:05] he realized the promise
[53:07] [Music]
[53:09] meaning yes in the miraculous birth of
[53:13] Isaac as a pledge of what was to come
[53:15] from God yes
[53:24] by one greater than themselves elves and
[53:27] with them in all disputes the Earth
[53:30] serves as confirmation of what has been
[53:33] said and is an end of that dispute
[53:42] [Music]
[53:50] even these days when someone is
[53:53] borrowing money they tell them to bring
[53:54] a guarantee
[53:59] one greater than you oh
[54:03] um
[54:04] when you fail to pay that they will be
[54:07] the one to be answerable yeah
[54:12] and so he says
[54:16] God in his desire to show to The Heirs
[54:19] of the promise the unchangeable nature
[54:21] of his purpose
[54:35] so that by the two unchangeable things I
[54:40] won't already into everybody
[54:43] they are true unchangeable things
[54:47] one is his promise
[54:54] God gave the promise
[54:57] and he swear by himself
[55:00] because there is no greater than him
[55:03] so he gave the promise
[55:09] and these are the true unchangeable
[55:12] things
[55:15] by these two unchangeable things
[55:18] in which it is impossible for God to lie
[55:24] we who have fled to him
[55:30] for Refuge
[55:32] we will have strong encouragement
[56:14] and the that the waves May blow Cartier
[56:19] and everything will come at this
[56:23] but as long as the anchor holds
[56:26] the sailors are hopefuls
[56:30] this is not even Faith
[56:36] they have something they know because I
[56:39] have something
[56:41] I have where I am holding
[56:44] and he says so that we can hold tightly
[56:49] to the Hope set before us
[56:54] and he says this hope I can assuming you
[56:58] know this confident assurance
[58:02] [Music]
[58:07] [Music]
[58:15] foreign Hallelujah
[58:18] [Applause]
[58:30] our prophet in the message Jehovah Jireh
[58:32] says
[58:35] like in the North Star
[58:38] is the typos to every shipmaster
[58:45] the campus points him only to that North
[58:48] Star yes
[58:54] the word is every Christian's North
[58:58] Stars
[59:03] if you are lost
[59:05] and the Holy Spirit is what points you
[59:08] to
[59:09] um
[59:11] it won't point to nothing else
[59:16] and so forth and Christianity mixed up
[59:19] in it whatever it may be
[59:23] it's like the world shifting
[59:26] [Music]
[59:29] it changes those stars
[59:33] but it cannot change
[59:36] that you neither can anything change the
[59:39] word of God
[59:41] and he says
[59:50] [Applause]
[59:53] foreign
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:19] [Music]
[1:01:49] if that happens
[1:01:53] your life is upside down
[1:01:56] but if you put your heart
[1:01:58] if you anchor it in the word of God
[1:02:02] oh friend the word of God never changes
[1:02:13] time is filled with swift transitions
[1:02:18] [Music]
[1:02:20] you find even many people in the
[1:02:23] churches
[1:02:24] they put all their hope in their pastors
[1:02:30] some they even worship their pastors
[1:02:37] when something happens to the past
[1:02:41] all of them a few of them remain
[1:02:44] Believers
[1:02:47] if you put your anchor in the world
[1:02:50] it doesn't matter what changes
[1:03:48] my heart in the word of God
[1:04:51] there is one
[1:05:37] [Music]
[1:05:40] that actually you are left alone
[1:05:43] [Music]
[1:05:51] thank God for the anchors
[1:05:56] Hallelujah
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:56] yeah blessed our anchor there
[1:06:59] let me tell you young people
[1:07:02] there are many things
[1:07:05] you can put your life
[1:07:11] and you say as long as I study no guy
[1:07:14] must say we're not summer I am sure I
[1:07:16] will have money
[1:07:18] I'm sure life will be well soon
[1:07:21] but I am I here to disappoint you yes
[1:07:27] oh that is
[1:07:31] change in just a moment
[1:07:33] in
[1:07:35] just a moment
[1:07:37] you can actually study yeah you might
[1:07:40] study your studies
[1:07:46] you may get a job and you get fired and
[1:07:51] you get fired and they get fired until
[1:07:54] many have become depressed
[1:07:58] and many have blamed God
[1:08:02] but this the reason was simple
[1:08:05] they put their anchor in the wrong
[1:08:07] things
[1:08:14] give your heart all your hope in God
[1:08:18] they say don't always put your eggs in
[1:08:21] one basket
[1:08:23] but as long as this is concerned
[1:08:28] put all your eggs
[1:08:46] Mina
[1:08:48] proving his word he says and I wanted
[1:08:50] you to be sure to see that
[1:08:54] the anchor that we have
[1:08:57] we are not anchored by a church
[1:09:01] we are Anchored In Christ
[1:09:04] you see he is the only way
[1:09:07] he is the only place of safety change
[1:09:11] the only place that God ever put his
[1:09:15] name
[1:09:17] and God said he would meet the people in
[1:09:20] the place he chose to put his name again
[1:09:29] but in the gate that he chose
[1:09:32] and in that place
[1:09:36] and there only
[1:09:40] and we find out that God never put his
[1:09:43] name anywhere else but in his son Jesus
[1:09:56] if our anchor is in Christ
[1:10:01] he called it an assurance
[1:10:07] this hope is confident Assurance
[1:10:16] of the Soul amen what Assurance if we
[1:10:20] are Anchored In Christ
[1:10:22] everything is sorted if you are Anchored
[1:10:26] In Christ
[1:10:33] please provide your needs
[1:10:36] in Christ
[1:10:38] he will take away your problems
[1:10:45] he will hold you there he will make sure
[1:10:49] they don't destroy it
[1:10:51] even some of you who are Anchored In
[1:10:54] Christ
[1:10:55] you can give a testimony
[1:10:57] there are things that came
[1:11:00] you were almost sure it was going to
[1:11:03] destroy your life
[1:11:04] [Applause]
[1:11:07] yeah he was still standing together
[1:11:10] what is that the alcohol
[1:11:13] can you say it on your mouth the uncle
[1:11:16] oh
[1:11:18] hallelujah amen and because of that I
[1:11:22] said keep trusting in Jesus
[1:11:26] you remember those times when you cried
[1:11:28] and cried and cried
[1:11:31] when you prayed and you thought God
[1:11:34] can't even hear yourself
[1:11:43] God Gave You Grace
[1:11:47] because The Anchor Holds
[1:11:51] Hallelujah
[1:11:53] that's why we are throwing our anchor in
[1:11:55] Christ
[1:12:01] I don't fear no windows
[1:13:04] to run away from the ship
[1:13:07] foreign
[1:14:12] because they're throwing their anchors
[1:14:28] but Brothers
[1:14:37] these storms
[1:14:44] I wanted to see here in the book of Acts
[1:14:47] chapter 27.
[1:14:52] was it happened to be at Sea um
[1:14:57] and there was a very big way a typhoon
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:05] and it was with soldiers and a centurion
[1:15:09] and and it's long story but I just read
[1:15:13] a little portion of it
[1:15:17] I'm just reading out of verses 23 to 26.
[1:15:23] and I'll give you the background
[1:15:27] support here says
[1:15:32] he says for this very night an angel of
[1:15:34] the Lord to whom I belong
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:53] God has given you the lives of all those
[1:15:57] who are sailing with you
[1:16:00] so keep up your courage man
[1:16:04] for I believe God and have complete and
[1:16:09] have complete confidence in him that it
[1:16:10] will turn out exactly as I have been
[1:16:13] told
[1:16:17] but we must run
[1:16:20] the Sheep are ground on some islands
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:26] now the background of the story is that
[1:16:28] for about 14 days Paul and those on the
[1:16:30] ship had been battered by a big storm
[1:16:37] and for 11 days they were in total
[1:16:41] darkness
[1:16:44] and they were in suspense
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:49] you know
[1:16:53] maybe none of us has ever been at Sea
[1:16:56] obviously
[1:16:58] so we may not relate
[1:17:02] from reading
[1:17:04] this scripture here it shows us that the
[1:17:08] the they were in this big ship
[1:17:12] and it was going a certain direction
[1:17:17] and when this storm Cameo it blew them
[1:17:23] so they couldn't resist it
[1:17:26] so they let themselves go as God the way
[1:17:31] it is taking them
[1:17:35] but they have thrown the anchor
[1:17:38] and so the first anchor that thrown it
[1:17:41] down
[1:17:42] and so they were on the on the board and
[1:17:45] it was just the storm was just taking
[1:17:48] them
[1:17:51] they reached a place
[1:17:53] where they were in suspense
[1:17:57] completely hopeless
[1:18:00] the place where they were was dark
[1:18:05] for 11 days
[1:18:12] 11 days
[1:18:20] one two three four five six seven eleven
[1:18:22] days
[1:18:26] [Music]
[1:18:35] we just don't know when death is
[1:18:41] I said but now yeah the anchor had been
[1:18:45] cast
[1:18:48] The Anchor was holding
[1:18:51] praise the name of the Lord
[1:18:55] and that's the only thing that
[1:18:57] encouraged encourages
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:18:59] the anchor was holding while all this
[1:19:02] was going on
[1:19:05] do you know suspense
[1:19:09] when you don't know what is coming next
[1:19:14] foreign
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:20:27] I don't want you to be afraid
[1:20:30] he said stop in the amplifier he says
[1:20:32] stop being afraid Bible yes
[1:20:37] tell your neighbors
[1:20:43] stop being afraid
[1:20:45] brother some stopping Africa
[1:20:48] stop being afraid
[1:20:50] Hallelujah stop being afraid
[1:20:54] then you spoke to him
[1:20:56] the reason why he says stop being afraid
[1:21:00] because there is some good news
[1:21:03] that was some good news
[1:21:11] he said stop being afraid
[1:21:15] you know you must stand before Caesar
[1:21:19] stop being afraid you know you must
[1:21:22] stand before the devil
[1:21:25] and defeat him um
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:43] to stand for a testimony
[1:22:41] the lives of all those
[1:23:41] they died
[1:24:25] God has given all of them
[1:24:29] I don't know whether you're getting some
[1:24:30] deeper definition
[1:24:49] and they will come to him
[1:24:54] he would say
[1:24:56] oh yes I'm the one that you preached to
[1:24:59] indeed engineer let me tell you we are
[1:25:03] going to be there together you behind
[1:25:05] our message

[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:51] you are not going to die that is the
[1:25:54] Promise
[1:25:58] by these two impossible oh my God God
[1:26:01] cannot lie
[1:26:03] we have a promise
[1:26:21] foreign
[1:26:54] do you know you can you you you you can
[1:26:58] plead for your children
[1:27:04] foreign
[1:27:30] Paul
[1:28:14] confidence in him that it will turn out
[1:28:16] even as exactly as I have been told
[1:28:53] foreign
[1:29:10] you know many times we think it's only
[1:29:13] the anchor the anchor that works
[1:29:18] but the anchor has a chain on it
[1:29:22] this chain which is connected to the
[1:29:24] Anchorage
[1:29:26] I said the chain is also
[1:29:31] Christo balances
[1:29:45] depending on what you're going through
[1:29:48] you know God katonda will give you more
[1:29:51] grace
[1:29:52] the Bible says he giveth more grace
[1:29:56] what is that it gives more power
[1:30:00] he gives his presence
[1:30:07] and this is and it cannot
[1:30:10] failure is immutable
[1:30:14] and as I'm approaching to
[1:30:15] congratulations is when I look and see
[1:30:17] the nation is broke
[1:30:21] I see politics
[1:30:24] I see the homes broke I see the church
[1:30:27] broke there is just nothing else can
[1:30:30] mend it
[1:30:33] that's all
[1:30:35] because they have not nothing else the
[1:30:38] morals of the nation is
[1:30:42] the political parties
[1:30:46] you are saying what is happening
[1:30:48] recently you know if they see even
[1:30:49] within themselves they're fighting and
[1:30:51] then another party they're fighting with
[1:30:52] another party
[1:30:58] and
[1:31:03] the police so much in our politics they
[1:31:04] are broke
[1:31:08] and some great fellow in in England not
[1:31:11] long ago he said well democracy was all
[1:31:13] sales and no anchor
[1:31:16] um
[1:31:23] he was saying that it is democracy is
[1:31:27] all sales and no anger government
[1:31:29] democracy
[1:31:33] he's not talking well about it he's
[1:31:35] saying it's just sales without an anchor
[1:31:37] okay
[1:31:43] that said they would have there would
[1:31:46] come a time that they would be on us on
[1:31:48] soapboxes electioneering he says well
[1:31:50] that's true he says but he didn't think
[1:31:51] of his own beloved House of Lords
[1:31:53] meaning in England how it was also a lot
[1:31:56] of sales and no anchor too it will be
[1:31:58] aware also
[1:32:06] you see this is um uh someone from
[1:32:10] England
[1:32:12] trying to say that the democracy
[1:32:18] was not good
[1:32:21] and them in England they're better off
[1:32:25] but brother is trying to prove a point
[1:32:27] here that all politics is
[1:32:32] all sales
[1:32:36] and every Kingdom of this world will be
[1:32:39] brought to Pieces
[1:32:42] Jesus Christ will rule and Reign yes
