[58:11] you know now we are very much connected
[58:13] most of you are already on social media
[58:15] and you are seeing a lot of invitations

[58:24] be guided by our pastors
[58:28] don't always run to wherever you are
[58:30] invited
[58:32] you must always receive guidance
[58:37] not everywhere you are going you will
[58:39] you will get food since

[58:45] but we have a lot of invitations even
[58:47] now as I came in I just received one
[58:49] that I had not seen before to YouTube
[58:54] so I don't know whether you will
[58:56] conflict with our programs but we'll
[58:58] look at it
[59:02] but from 22nd to 26th of this month
[59:10] we have uh two conventions
[59:15] and they are all believers conventions
[59:20] myself and a few of you have always been
[59:22] a part of the convention in Kenya
[59:26] [Music]
[59:26] um
[59:29] during that time this is usually called
[59:31] Christmas meetings
[59:36] so this time again they have invited us
[59:39] to go and be a part of those meetings
[59:44] anyone that has a national ID and a pass

[1:05:27] money has been doing that you have been
[1:05:29] giving throughout the year
[1:05:36] uh we have to account to you because you

[1:05:43] it and also we have a project that we
[1:05:45] are currently running that is the our uh

[1:05:55] and I think at this time I can also give
[1:05:58] you an update
[1:06:02] um
[1:06:04] noticed that since we moved here is
[1:06:11] those of you who were on fire
[1:06:15] giving
[1:06:17] daily and weekly
[1:06:20] you just stopped um I think when you
[1:06:24] arrived here you thought you have now
[1:06:26] bought the Churchland
[1:06:31] we have not bought the church lands
[1:06:35] and we have not arrived yet
[1:06:39] in the business meeting I'll talk more
[1:06:41] details
[1:06:50] only a handful of names and these are
[1:06:52] recording names
[1:06:57] and most of them are actually members of
[1:06:59] my my family
[1:07:02] that is myself
[1:07:08] and then also uh brother
[1:07:11] calebu and brother Peter burganda Peter
[1:07:17] um brother Solomon also gave something
[1:07:19] on November 3rd burgundy Solomon
[1:07:22] those are the only names I've seen
[1:07:25] since October first
[1:07:29] okay October 1st yes if you've given
[1:07:34] anything since October first
[1:07:39] and I've not talked about you
[1:07:43] that means we never received it and
[1:07:48] um
[1:07:52] brother Tim brother Tim Dort came and
[1:07:55] visited us here all again the team
[1:07:58] uh he was his time was short so he
[1:08:01] didn't have time to minister uh to us
[1:08:03] this time
[1:08:07] but when he came
[1:08:11] and his wife
[1:08:14] and my family the family we were able to
[1:08:17] meet him Brother Martin Thomas thinking
[1:08:19] he had a little Fellowship
[1:08:22] foreign
[1:08:30] books that we supply to the whole
[1:08:32] country
[1:08:36] also across the borders
[1:08:41] Ethiopia and also to to Rwanda
[1:08:44] so those Brothers sponsor the pepper and
[1:08:48] some of you here contribute your time
[1:08:51] you volunteer to print that but they
[1:08:53] come Fatima
[1:09:04] teams
[1:09:06] and when he came here
[1:09:08] he was surprised and he was moved you
[1:09:13] know the other Church where we were can
[1:09:15] you say he went right I think it was
[1:09:17] just half of this section
[1:09:21] those of you who don't know that mother
[1:09:24] just a section there outside
[1:09:30] so
[1:09:31] um
[1:09:32] he was moved and he was impressed how
[1:09:36] far we have gone yeah
[1:09:40] and I want to say and to let you know
[1:09:43] that he also contributed 1.4 million
[1:09:49] a
[1:09:52] um
[1:09:53] I think that is so far the only money we
[1:09:56] have received from someone from another
[1:09:58] country
[1:09:59] from another country
[1:10:03] to support our calls
[1:10:07] but that together with everything we've
[1:10:09] contributed
[1:10:13] since September 19th of last year
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:19] you remember the person who gave the
[1:10:21] very fast my
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:49] and uh
[1:10:51] I want to tell you we have we are not
[1:10:53] stuck with the vision
[1:10:59] but from what I'm saying here
[1:11:02] I think many of you
[1:11:09] every day
[1:11:11] I know that it's not been easy in these
[1:11:13] past few months
[1:11:16] but I believe you can surely do much
[1:11:19] better than this
[1:11:22] I will reserve my comments and most of
[1:11:25] the details in our business meeting
[1:11:30] but I want to say to that we've given a
[1:11:34] total of 29 Millions 149 000.
[1:11:44] now some of that when we were moving
[1:11:47] here we we used it to do a few things
[1:11:50] here

[1:11:57] details in the business meeting

[1:21:13] I see
[1:21:17] let us pray
[1:21:21] Lord Jesus
[1:21:25] we know it is a reality
[1:21:29] that one day you were born in a manger
[1:21:31] okay
[1:21:35] that is
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:22:02] I pray that we will recognize you this
[1:22:04] morning
[1:22:06] and as we speak on this
[1:22:10] rare subject
[1:22:13] Christ in Christmas
[1:22:19] at the end of this service
[1:22:24] give me inspiration
[1:22:27] let your Holy Spirit
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:36] foreign
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:22:49] I'm just praying that the Lord will
[1:22:51] count me down and uh
[1:22:54] so I don't just go over the things but
[1:22:57] be sensitively his spirit
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:04] and if we don't get done maybe we'll
[1:23:06] just carry on on Wednesday probably
[1:23:07] about time
[1:23:14] this is the month they say
[1:23:18] that Jesus was born
[1:23:22] of course we know that is not true
[1:23:24] um
[1:23:33] okay so those are the things I want us
[1:23:35] to deal with
[1:23:37] I said it's a rare subject
[1:23:41] and this is one that actually shocks a
[1:23:43] lot of people when they get to realize
[1:23:45] it
[1:23:48] if there is one thing that is really so
[1:23:51] bad
[1:23:52] is nothing as bad as tradition
[1:23:58] we
[1:23:59] Slowly by slowly
[1:24:04] and the truth sometimes and many times
[1:24:07] is actually replaced with tradition
[1:24:11] Al
[1:24:15] and when you tell somebody a tradition
[1:24:18] is not true
[1:24:21] they will disfellowship with you
[1:24:24] they will disconnect themselves from you
[1:24:30] and they will say you have a first
[1:24:32] doctor
[1:24:34] like you know when we tell people that
[1:24:36] the Trinity is a Doctrine from hell
[1:24:42] it's a Catholic Doctrine
[1:24:45] it has nothing to do with the Bible
[1:24:48] oh they will frown at you
[1:24:50] they will tell you what because the
[1:24:54] Trinity has been preached as a major
[1:24:56] Christian doctrine for centuries
[1:25:03] but last Sunday we dealt with that next
[1:25:07] Sunday
[1:25:08] we were able to find out there is
[1:25:10] nothing like a trinity or person
[1:25:14] there is only eternity of a person what
[1:25:18] do you
[1:25:30] that manifests himself in three
[1:25:33] different manifestations
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:39] but then they said father is God's son
[1:25:42] is God and holy spirit is God and each
[1:25:44] of them is independent
[1:25:49] um
[1:25:53] but that is not true there is nothing
[1:25:56] like an eternal son
[1:25:59] because to be an eternal son you have to
[1:26:02] be without beginning and without ending
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:09] but we know that Jesus
[1:26:11] at the beginning
[1:26:29] and then we also found that there are
[1:26:31] people who try to make Jesus father son
[1:26:33] holy spirit
[1:26:38] so we found out that is not true
[1:26:42] we dealt with that on Sunday will not go
[1:26:44] back
[1:26:46] you can go and listen to that someone is
[1:26:49] called
[1:26:50] the unrecognized Christ
[1:26:56] so this morning we are going to deal
[1:26:59] with Christ in Christmas
[1:27:03] now I know among the message circles
[1:27:08] they don't even Christmas is one of the
[1:27:10] words that is they're so allergic too
[1:27:12] much
[1:27:15] because everybody else in the world
[1:27:19] is you know 25th December is a great day
[1:27:25] they cook good food they shop wonderful
[1:27:29] things
[1:27:32] because of that or Rachel many Believers
[1:27:36] I don't know where they got that from
[1:27:38] men
[1:27:40] decided even to eat beans
[1:27:45] because they want to look different
[1:27:48] we should not do something because we
[1:27:50] want to look different
[1:27:53] and I want to thank God because we have
[1:27:56] a guide
[1:27:57] the Holy Spirit
[1:28:00] but the Holy Spirit uses men and women
[1:28:06] Bible
[1:29:36] but we thank God for the prophet of this
[1:29:39] hour
[1:29:43] foreign
[1:30:21] we will read from verses 1 to 7.
[1:30:29] and it came to pass in those days that
[1:30:30] they went out a decree from Caesar
[1:30:32] Augustus that all the world should be
[1:30:34] taxed and this taxing was first made
[1:30:36] once tyrannius was governor of Syria
[1:30:40] and all and all went to be taxed
[1:30:45] everyone into his own City
[1:30:50] and Joseph also went up From Galilee out
[1:30:53] of the city of Nazareth into Judea and
[1:30:56] to the city of David which is called
[1:30:58] Bethlehem because he was the he was of
[1:31:02] the house and lineage of David to be
[1:31:05] taxed with Mary his espoused wife being
[1:31:08] great with child and so it was that
[1:31:10] while they were there the days were
[1:31:12] accomplished that she should be
[1:31:14] delivered and she brought forth her
[1:31:16] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[1:31:19] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[1:31:21] Manger because there was no room for
[1:31:23] them in the Inn again
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:26] because there was no room for them in
[1:32:29] the inner
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:33] negative can we repeat that again
[1:32:35] everyone now because there was no room
[1:32:39] for them in the air amen you may be
[1:32:42] seated
[1:32:44] now in the message the acts of the Holy
[1:32:46] Spirit
[1:32:50] the prophet of God says
[1:32:54] now as we are approaching Christmas time
[1:32:57] now and here the things are decorated
[1:33:00] all up with Santa Claus instead of Jesus
[1:33:06] you know Santa Claus Santa Claus who
[1:33:11] knows Santa Claus Santa Cruz all right
[1:33:14] you know that that big man
[1:33:16] with red onion something white around
[1:33:21] with big I don't know how exactly I can
[1:33:24] describe
[1:33:25] but he's called Father Christmas
[1:33:29] you know he's everywhere and all over
[1:33:33] you know and they're decorating that
[1:33:36] you know and instead of Jesus
[1:33:43] we are approaching Christmas foreign
[1:34:13] [Music]
[1:34:36] and instead of rejoicing under the
[1:34:39] spirit of God
[1:34:42] they go out and get drunk and rejoice
[1:34:47] and listen to me the prophet of God says
[1:34:50] here that is what makes the difference
[1:34:56] foreign
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:33] [Music]
[1:35:42] they get drunk but and then they Rejoice
[1:35:45] so I want to ask you a question why are
[1:35:48] they rejoicing is it because of the
[1:35:51] mouth of
[1:35:52] Christopher because of the alcohol
[1:35:58] what is the celebration about
[1:36:00] from the beginning the birth of Jesus
[1:36:03] Christ was not celebrated
[1:36:08] from the beginning
[1:36:10] we've read it together
[1:36:13] you know it was time the time of taxing
[1:36:16] Charities
[1:36:18] and the emperor had given an order
[1:36:35] Joseph you know the story of Joseph and
[1:36:38] Maryam how Joseph was espoused engaged
[1:36:42] with Mary history
[1:36:44] and then she he found one day he woke up
[1:36:48] and found
[1:36:49] his girlfriend pregnant
[1:36:54] and you know there is only one reason
[1:36:58] that a man can divorce a wife
[1:37:05] praise the name of the Lord praise the
[1:37:08] name of the Lord if that girl
[1:37:11] um
[1:37:12] fornicated
[1:37:14] as a matter of fact Jesus himself when
[1:37:17] he came yesterday he said If any man um
[1:37:21] divorces his wife
[1:37:24] and marriage
[1:37:28] accept it before the cause of
[1:37:30] fornication
[1:37:34] um
[1:37:40] now listen let me explain that a little
[1:37:43] more so there is a difference between
[1:37:45] fornication and adultery
[1:37:49] no Wednesday
[1:37:50] right
[1:37:53] fornication is allocating living
[1:38:00] is immorality
[1:38:03] before marriage
[1:38:11] done by somebody who is married
[1:38:20] there is no such a divorce in the Bible
[1:38:26] brother you can catch already
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:30] but you can't divorce
[1:38:32] if you want to divorce
[1:38:36] and he will she will remain
[1:38:39] because she is your wife
[1:38:43] does not warrant divorce
[1:38:58] so how can a married woman foreign
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:43] go back because they never married to
[1:39:45] begin with
[1:39:48] marriage must be made on the basis of
[1:39:51] good faith or before
[1:39:55] on Truth praise the name of the Lord so
[1:39:59] if there is a lie in it
[1:40:02] and she did not disclose his life
[1:40:06] to him
[1:40:09] and he finds out later
[1:40:12] and she that means that he can put her
[1:40:15] away
[1:40:22] that means you should when you are going
[1:40:25] to get married
[1:40:27] before you accept to be married
[1:40:31] you must confess your life to him
[1:40:35] just like we confess our life to Jesus
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:41:10] so here we find out that Joseph was
[1:41:14] engaged with Mary YouTube
[1:41:17] Mary was a virgin Mary
[1:41:20] but later on
[1:41:23] Joseph finds out that Mary is pregnant
[1:41:29] she must have lied to me
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:36] in the public
[1:41:38] so he wanted to leave her but privately
[1:42:05] and we notice that Jesus yes was not
[1:42:08] made out of the egg of Mary yes
[1:42:12] but he actually came from the word of
[1:42:15] God yes
[1:42:18] he himself was the word
[1:42:22] Dua praise the name of the Lord
[1:42:25] and so now Joseph carries on with his
[1:42:28] wife
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:30] and he said okay let us now raise this
[1:42:32] child
[1:42:34] and one day they have gone to do the
[1:42:38] taxing
[1:42:40] with Mary the Maryam and Mary was about
[1:42:43] to deliver Mariam was in the late stages
[1:42:46] of the pregnancies
[1:42:49] and while they were there the Bible says
[1:42:52] the days were accomplished
[1:42:56] we shall come back to this but I want to
[1:42:58] ask you how many days does a woman take
[1:43:00] to deliver um
[1:43:07] foreign
[1:43:36] foreign
[1:43:39] because there was listen now to this
[1:43:41] because there was no room for them in
[1:43:44] the inner
[1:43:49] Jesus yes are you hearing me church
[1:43:53] was born yes tell someone Jesus was born
[1:44:00] listen to this the day he was born
[1:44:04] was actually not celebrated
[1:44:09] did they celebrate it
[1:44:10] as a matter of fact when Mary was going
[1:44:13] to give back
[1:44:14] she went to the uh
[1:44:17] with Joseph
[1:44:19] to try and find just a room
[1:44:23] where Jesus where Jesus will be born yes
[1:44:27] but everybody told them sorry
[1:44:31] we are busy
[1:44:33] they must I'm sure they must have gone
[1:44:36] in almost every place
[1:44:41] if they were the only available places
[1:44:59] for the savior of the world
[1:45:03] be born let alone celebrate his birth
[1:45:09] foreign
[1:45:22] did not celebrate it but nothing
[1:45:24] eventually
[1:45:26] the Romans the national leaders
[1:45:30] they did not celebrate it the family of
[1:45:34] both Mary even the family
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:38] you don't know what we are talking about
[1:45:41] do you not giving birth to a child
[1:45:45] is not celebrating
[1:45:49] it means it is
[1:45:54] you know children you know children are
[1:45:57] joy in the home
[1:45:59] and you know even whenever a girl even
[1:46:02] becomes pregnant without being married
[1:46:06] you know many people will not celebrate
[1:46:09] the birth of a child and to banjo your
[1:46:12] money but at least
[1:46:22] foreign
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:33] so they thought they were outcasts study
[1:47:36] by himself
[1:47:41] so they left them aside they didn't even
[1:47:45] have a place
[1:47:46] for Jesus to be born so they decided to
[1:47:51] go out there
[1:47:53] and in a Manger
[1:47:57] where a sheep is born
[1:48:05] a despised place
[1:48:08] that is the only place where they found
[1:48:11] rooms
[1:48:15] Jesus was born yes
[1:48:18] hallelujah amen but there was no one
[1:48:22] woman two years
[1:48:25] from the political fraternities
[1:49:04] or something else
[1:49:09] it is evident from The Works
[1:49:13] they do not celebrate questions
[1:49:20] not our Christopher this I will prove to
[1:49:24] you in a few moments
[1:49:26] because the Bible in the book of second
[1:49:28] Timothy chapter 3 verse
[1:49:34] in the last days
[1:49:38] for men shall be listen man shall be
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:44] loverselves
[1:49:54] disobedient to their parents
[1:50:01] in our generation you give somebody
[1:50:03] something and they say only this is
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:51:07] question say my hand will be so so bad
[1:51:13] the condition will be worse
[1:51:16] would have come from good to worse
[1:51:22] men will be traitors
[1:51:40] then he says there will be lovers or
[1:51:43] Pleasures
[1:51:45] more than lovers of God
[1:51:49] man in our generation
[1:51:52] they want pleasure
[1:51:54] I always see you know at home
[1:51:58] you know one day I was just thinking
[1:52:00] about it
[1:52:01] you know on the screen I was putting
[1:52:04] certain things for my children
[1:52:07] I know foreign
[1:52:34] foreign
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:34] are the form of godliness
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:44] are you hearing me now in the days of
[1:53:47] the birth of Jesus
[1:54:01] can we say that our generation is better
[1:54:04] praise
[1:54:05] our generation loves Jesus
[1:54:15] there is a form of godliness
[1:54:21] you can't find you can realize it
[1:54:23] together when I tell you people are not
[1:54:25] worshiping uh celebrating the birth of
[1:54:27] Christ
[1:54:43] not actually point to the fact that they
[1:54:46] are celebrating the birth of Christ
[1:54:51] that is a form of God
[1:54:57] do you know what the power is
[1:55:00] the world
[1:55:02] the power is the gospel the Bible says
[1:55:06] in the Book of Romans
[1:55:12] why because it is
[1:55:21] and this gospel is the power I am not
[1:55:24] ashamed to carry my Bible this is
[1:55:30] why I tell my friends about Jesus
[1:55:34] tell people I believe in Jesus Christ
[1:55:45] is the most sinful day on Earth
[1:55:52] hey
[1:55:54] what is wrong with you Pastor today
[1:55:57] I'm saying the truth
[1:56:00] even people over here
[1:56:02] and probably literally they leave church
[1:56:07] in the early morning
[1:56:10] and they go to bars
[1:56:12] why today is our day
[1:56:16] it is Christmas
[1:56:20] anymore
[1:56:25] they have removed Christ
[1:56:28] because there is nothing about Jesus
[1:56:30] Christ
[1:56:33] and then they bring their father
[1:56:35] Christmas
[1:56:37] Connection does he have with the Bible
[1:56:39] Father Christmas in the Bible
[1:56:43] I want to say to you
[1:56:46] days of the voice
[1:56:48] hallelujah amen let us put Christ back
[1:56:51] in Christmas
[1:56:57] hallelujah amen they say they are
[1:57:00] celebrating his boss
[1:57:11] foreign
[1:57:32] and their father will go again
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:57:40] [Music]
[1:57:43] nothing to do with Jesus Christi
[1:57:54] let us tell our children
[1:58:01] of Jesus
[1:58:05] as a matter of fact the Bible does not
[1:58:09] tell us to celebrate the birth of Christ
[1:58:13] if we celebrate our own birthdays
[1:58:17] remember the Bible never told us
[1:58:21] I want to say this to you
[1:58:24] as the true bride of Christ
[1:58:27] kind of people to celebrate the birth of
[1:58:30] Christ amen
[1:58:35] in the right way
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:39] is not a celebration
[1:58:43] it is a worship it is
[1:59:24] through deception
[1:59:29] they have depressed Christ with X
[1:59:31] crystal is
[1:59:36] clearly this is just a form of godliness
[1:59:42] let me show you the two celebrations
[1:59:54] praise the name of the Lord
[2:00:00] and there and they were in the same
[2:00:03] country shepherds abiding in the field
[2:00:05] keeping watch over their flock by night
[2:00:07] and Lord the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[2:00:09] them and the glory of the Lord Shone
[2:00:11] right about them and they were so afraid
[2:00:14] and the angels said unto them fear not
[2:00:16] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[2:00:19] great joy Hallelujah we shall be to all
[2:00:23] people read that Lucas is
[2:00:46] all right I mean yes
[2:01:08] amen I want you to see how Jesus one
[2:01:12] should receive his birth yes
[2:01:17] Jesus did not go to the priests
[2:01:19] yesterday against he did not go to the
[2:01:22] to the king say again he didn't even go
[2:01:25] to the damn churches
[2:01:29] but where did he go by infestation of
[2:01:33] angels
[2:01:34] he went to the Shepherds
[2:01:37] where was Jesus born yes yes
[2:01:45] so he went to the Shepherds
[2:01:48] who understand the manger
[2:01:53] I mean hallelujah amen so you went to
[2:01:57] the supper they were at the lowest
[2:02:02] sized people
[2:02:04] of their time even today
[2:02:07] [Music]
[2:02:09] what is the
[2:02:12] shepherdachi you know when you go to the
[2:02:14] Village
[2:02:15] you find them you know having a road
[2:02:20] stinking clothes
[2:02:23] is smelling cows
[2:02:28] having that you know just you know
[2:02:30] having even the belly dressing
[2:02:34] and then you know you're just you know
[2:02:37] going with the cows
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:41] yeah
[2:02:44] no so when you really pass a Shepherd
[2:02:47] wood
[2:02:49] you look down you look down on them
[2:02:53] oh poor fellas
[2:02:57] shepherds are not great people
[2:03:01] just like Lambs
[2:03:06] something was happening May one way to
[2:03:08] get in the mass what was being born that
[2:03:10] day
[2:03:12] was
[2:03:14] the lamb did not need the religious
[2:03:17] people
[2:03:26] hallelujah amen and when the angel of
[2:03:29] the Lord came down and light the glory
[2:03:30] of the Lord Shone around about them
[2:03:34] and the angel said unto them fear for
[2:03:39] behold I bring you good tidings of great
[2:03:41] joy
[2:03:44] which shall be to all people
[2:03:47] front to you is Born This Day in the
[2:03:50] city of David a savior
[2:03:54] did you hear that or you did not
[2:03:58] you is born this day
[2:04:01] for the city of David a savior
[2:04:05] which is Christ the lord
[2:04:08] now many people
[2:04:10] they think that those wise men
[2:04:14] they came on the day Jesus was born
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:22] the wise man
[2:04:24] they came between one another and two
[2:04:28] years after the birth of Jesus
[2:04:31] [Music]
[2:04:34] you remember that after they left but
[2:04:38] I'm out of fire and the King wanted to
[2:04:41] kill the children because he wanted to
[2:04:42] kill Jesus
[2:04:46] killed everyone two years and below
[2:04:53] because Jesus at that time was in that
[2:04:55] age group
[2:04:58] but the people around that made the
[2:05:01] birth of Jesus on the same day Christo
[2:05:19] and this shall be assigned unto you you
[2:05:21] shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling
[2:05:23] clothe is lying in a Manger okay
[2:05:31] and suddenly there was with the angel of
[2:05:34] multitude of the Heavenly Host praising
[2:05:37] God and saying glory to God in their
[2:05:41] eyes and on the earth peace Good Will
[2:05:44] toward men
[2:05:46] and it was it has it and it came to pass
[2:05:48] us the Angels were gone away from them
[2:05:50] into heaven the shepherd said unto one
[2:05:52] another let us now go even unto
[2:05:55] Bethlehem and see this thing which is
[2:05:57] come to pass which the Lord has made
[2:06:00] known unto us and they came with haste
[2:06:02] and upon Mary and Joseph and the Babe
[2:06:04] lying in a manger and when they had seen
[2:06:07] it they made known abroad the saying
[2:06:09] which was told them concerning this
[2:06:11] child and all that they had and all they
[2:06:14] that had it wandered orders at those
[2:06:17] things which were told them by the
[2:06:20] Shepherds but Mary kept all these things
[2:06:22] and pondered them in our heart and the
[2:06:25] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[2:06:26] praising God for all the things that
[2:06:29] they had had and seen as it was told
[2:06:33] unto them now I want you to see several
[2:06:35] things here one way of interview with
[2:06:36] everyone number one that the news or the
[2:06:39] message of his birth was ministered by
[2:06:41] an Angel not Santa

[2:07:01] is not going to be administered by
[2:07:05] a priest
[2:07:07] [Music]
[2:07:08] by some religious order
[2:07:11] um
[2:07:23] really the first three chapters
[2:07:26] of the Seven Angels
[2:07:34] Came in every age to be clear at the
[2:07:38] birth of Jesus
[2:07:41] was the Declaration of the birth of
[2:07:44] Jesus
[2:07:47] of course in this case
[2:07:50] it is a spiritual declaration
[2:07:53] because it's not the Jesus that was born
[2:07:55] at that time we are looking for now yeah
[2:07:58] foreign
[2:08:56] the message will always come to the
[2:08:58] vilest of sinners

[2:09:06] that Jesus was in a Manger
[2:09:11] the most unexpected place for him to be
[2:09:14] 84.

[2:17:55] maybe it's around late much
[2:18:01] it's the end of June
[2:18:03] then the the due date would be around
[2:18:06] the airport

[2:18:33] much or apple
[2:18:35] um
[2:18:36] in December December it is winter
[2:18:43] and no Lambs can be born
[2:18:55] yes
[2:18:58] you might be a Catholic
[2:19:00] and they believe Jesus was born on 25th
[2:19:02] December
[2:19:04] I have a question for you was Jesus born
[2:19:08] as a premature yes
[2:19:17] was he put into a woman
[2:19:23] the Bible already has told us
[2:19:26] in Luke chapter 2 verse 6.
[2:19:34] that easy to say of Jesus being born yes
[2:19:39] the Bible did not say oh because Joseph
[2:19:43] and Mary were walking yes
[2:19:46] the pregnancy
[2:19:49] went upside down
[2:20:02] if Jesus was born on 25th December
[2:20:11] but according to the Bible Bible he had
[2:20:15] full time
[2:20:18] he had to have full time
[2:20:23] be a hundred percent a month
[2:20:27] in Israel are usually born around that
[2:20:29] time
[2:20:33] even when you see when Jesus was born
[2:20:35] they wanted a Manger
[2:20:38] there was no snow
[2:20:43] but whenever you see people celebrating
[2:20:45] Christmas
[2:20:47] during snow time
[2:21:01] why did they choose that day
[2:21:04] that debt was already there
[2:21:07] before the birth of Jesus
[2:21:10] and they were already celebrating the
[2:21:12] other gods
[2:21:16] of December
[2:21:20] and our Jesus
[2:21:22] he's actually born yesterday in the
[2:21:25] springtime
[2:21:30] God bless you
[2:21:32] thank you for opening my eyes
[2:21:41] of Jesus
[2:22:00] [Applause]
[2:22:05] but now as it is
[2:22:08] they have completely there is no Christ
[2:22:25] it's about other gods
[2:22:28] [Music]
[2:22:41] giving all those kind of gifts of
[2:22:43] alcohol
[2:22:46] and they go out naked
[2:22:49] fornication
[2:22:55] Christmas
[2:22:56] it's not even Christmas anymore
[2:23:01] because the Christ they're celebrating
[2:23:04] is not
[2:23:05] ourselves
[2:23:13] put back Christ in Christmas
[2:23:18] they are celebrating their own Christ
[2:23:26] have our Christmas
[2:23:31] we must tell our children have a
[2:23:34] favorite story
[2:23:36] what is wrong with food a military coach
[2:23:39] we must have wonderful food
[2:23:42] because our Jesus Christ he was born yes
[2:23:46] anyone was he born on 25th yesterday
[2:23:51] he wasn't they are very well I can
[2:23:53] choose to celebrate Christ even today
[2:23:57] what is wrong with that attention the
[2:24:01] queen had two best days
[2:24:07] yeah
[2:24:08] one I think was I don't know I don't
[2:24:10] know how they call it
[2:24:12] would be the official one and then her
[2:24:15] real birthday

[2:24:37] that's the wrong date
[2:24:44] laughs
[2:24:49] that that that's that's the one she told
[2:24:51] me at first
[2:24:53] and then recently destroyed me it was
[2:24:55] another one
[2:24:57] they forgotten again
[2:25:00] I mean praise the name of Allah but I
[2:25:04] celebrated
[2:25:06] he doesn't make me another person

[2:26:33] also had ever had a gift
[2:26:37] I can't remember
[2:26:40] but I'll sure be happy to get one man
[2:26:42] yes sir

[2:27:47] Jesus was not born on the December the
[2:27:49] 25th yesterday
[2:27:55] the hills of judeaf was full of snow at
[2:27:58] that time
[2:28:01] so how could it be
[2:28:04] remember that the Shepherds were they
[2:28:07] are grazing their sheep
[2:28:11] no you're not in the snow
[2:28:15] spring pie
[2:28:20] so you see Jesus commonly by astrology
[2:28:24] so forth and by all of it was born first
[2:28:27] around the first of April yesterday
[2:28:32] so when it was time and she said
[2:28:38] but this is a day

[2:28:55] any Memorial of his coming to the world
[2:28:59] [Music]
[2:29:01] one of the greatest gifts that God ever
[2:29:04] give to the world was Jesus Christ
[2:29:17] giving themselves those kind of gifts
[2:29:24] we are going to give us ourselves the
[2:29:27] gifts
[2:29:28] Chicago

[2:30:29] expect they can't understand
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:31] you have Revelation they don't or you
[2:30:34] know and then he would put the gifts
[2:30:37] under there
[2:30:38] and and you know they would come and
[2:30:40] pick it
[2:30:42] up and they would be so happy that it
[2:30:46] would make their time
[2:30:49] of telling his children

[2:31:06] have most of these I'll share them some
[2:31:08] of them on Wednesday if I feel late if

[2:31:11] and you can all right
[2:31:16] let me read a little more for you in
[2:31:18] Divine Healing he says and the fact of
[2:31:20] all the era and everything there is
[2:31:23] about there is something about it that
[2:31:25] the world tries to make it an Xmas
[2:31:30] moving to the Xmas
[2:31:39] he says and the fact of all the errors
[2:31:44] and everything there is about it
[2:31:54] in this thing there is something about
[2:31:57] it that the world tries to make it an
[2:31:59] X-Men is
[2:32:06] that the the error is is really the
[2:32:10] world Mexican
[2:32:12] [Music]
[2:32:15] but God has still got a Christmas in
[2:32:19] need Christmas
[2:32:25] somewhere I went to our house hasn't he
[2:32:30] he saw us he's got something about it
[2:32:35] justice the very names and the thoughts
[2:32:38] of the birth of the Lord Jesus
[2:32:43] Oh the world has put Santa Claus in his
[2:32:46] place
[2:32:49] but not the Christians
[2:32:54] still a Christmas a child Christmas
[2:32:58] that's what your Prophet says
[2:33:01] Christianity is still a Christmas
[2:33:05] we have not done it as a next month
[2:33:11] removed Christ we shall not remove
[2:33:14] replace him with Santa Claus Santa Claus
[2:33:25] praise the name of the Lord
[2:33:28] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:33:31] Christmas is the day of worship
[2:33:32] Christmas
[2:33:34] the prophet says and let me read another
[2:33:37] here in Christianity versus idolatry
[2:33:39] says Christmas is no more a worship
[2:33:41] Christmas
[2:33:42] is a celebration
[2:33:46] gambling arousing just Pagan to the
[2:33:51] limit for God feed your resources maybe
[2:33:53] after Christmas I'll speak again on
[2:33:55] Christmas
[2:33:57] so it won't deprive the little meaning
[2:33:59] of the children
[2:34:02] but you can't tell that that to little
[2:34:05] children like that
[2:34:08] they see little fellows on Christmas
[2:34:10] night getting Christmas presents
[2:34:15] and things like that so they can't
[2:34:18] understand it
[2:34:19] who is a very holy brother
[2:34:33] Merry Christmas
[2:34:35] and he's seeing the other children
[2:34:36] received
[2:34:40] no wonder
[2:34:42] very many young children who were raised
[2:34:44] by parents who believe the message
[2:34:57] they didn't follow what the prophet said
[2:35:01] are you hearing me Church
[2:35:03] fathers who are here mothers were here
[2:35:05] it's all right to give your gifts to
[2:35:08] your children on Christmas
[2:35:14] is perfectly all right
[2:35:16] but you can't tell that to leave the
[2:35:18] children like that they silly the
[2:35:19] fellows on Christmas night getting
[2:35:21] Christmas presents and things like that
[2:35:23] they don't understand it
[2:35:28] again
[2:35:31] and you've got to remember them
[2:35:33] they have things in common
[2:35:36] we've got to bring ourselves down to
[2:35:39] remember them little fellas
[2:35:45] praise the name of the Lord
[2:35:47] in Psalms we would see Jesus
[2:35:53] they have taken the sacredness from
[2:35:56] Christmas
[2:35:58] to make it not a Christmas
[2:36:04] day of Celebration
[2:36:09] we do not
[2:36:10] you hear people say we are going to
[2:36:13] Celebration we are going to celebrate
[2:36:14] Christmas
[2:36:17] what is wrong we should never celebrate
[2:36:20] Christmas
[2:36:21] is a day of worship Christmas
[2:36:29] Hallelujah
[2:36:35] but looking back on my life I wonder
[2:36:37] where it happened
[2:36:40] from them little Christmas says when we
[2:36:43] hung up our stockings and Mama would get
[2:36:45] would probably get an orange and two or
[2:36:47] three little pieces of stripped candy
[2:36:48] and that was a great Christmas to us
[2:36:57] Christmas but you know kids they look
[2:36:59] forward to the to those to them gifts
[2:37:03] we find out that that Christmas is is uh
[2:37:07] to the is mainly children
[2:37:12] that they look forward to that foreign
[2:37:45] and I can go on and on and on and on
[2:37:51] praise the name of the Lord
[2:37:57] I want to thank that lady I can't think
[2:37:59] of her name
[2:38:02] Billy just told me that had given me a
[2:38:04] box of Christmas candy yeah
