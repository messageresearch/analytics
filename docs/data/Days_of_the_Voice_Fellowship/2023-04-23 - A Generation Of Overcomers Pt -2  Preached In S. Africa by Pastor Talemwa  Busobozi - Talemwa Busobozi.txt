sitting there she's welcome amen appreciate god let's continue praying for brother Niven that he had a successful operation and we're thankful to God for the preservation of life and you know God is always good all the time and I'm so glad that he has been keeping us I was thinking about it yesterday that God has really been keeping the Saints in benoni and I've just been grateful to him and I want to be thankful that we shall live to see the rapture amen we shall live to see the Rapture is my prayer you know funerals are the most ugliest things they are not nice yet it's part of life but to us God has been gracious God has been kind amen maybe if my laws can be a bit of laws can be a bit High it would be fine especially on the monitors um so today I've got a couple of brothers that I want to come up here just share What the Lord Has Done in their lives I've been talking to them in the week and I said you know what you need to come and just share with us briefly what God has done for you amen I'm gonna ask brother Zippo to come come forward when I was talking to him he says pastor I'm a bit nervous to stand before the people but I believe you know when God has done something for you you know you want to testify about it praise the Lord you can come forward brother Zippo God bless you greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen the pastor is right I'm a bit nervous and I told him during the week that I'm not used to standing in front of the people especially the children of God but I'm so happy that the god that we serve is a true God who is the god that has actually removed the children of Israel from bondage with his mighty hand he's a God who still manifests today during the beginning of the year when we open the congregation the pastor mentioned something positive about DCM I might not put it in his context but I'll tell you how I have received it it was something that was telling me that whatever that is in the weight whatever that is preached it is something that is going to manifest in action this year and I'm standing before you to tell you that yes indeed our God is the great God and he has never failed me he is the true God so he said that when the enemy shall come like a flood he will raise the standard when you're seeing the pastor standing in front of us they carrying the weight it is the standard he's raising that standard to us well I'm gonna go to the testimony which I've told my pastor back at work I'm actually working at school metals we are making steel in that company so during the beginning of the month we had an encounter whereby the employees started to have to it I will call itoi if you want me to call it that way but basically they were craving they had some grievances which actually caused them to do a work stoppage so I'm not gonna be long but I'm just gonna put it in brief but tell you how that has changed me how has that made me to realize that our God is the true God so my brothers and sisters and my pastors before me I want to say that the employees embarked on that strike for something like eight days and management stood up and told them that you know what what you're doing is not right so they gave them an ultimatum to say they need to go back to work however they proceeded with the toy Towing and then later management decided that no now we're going to court to obtain a court interdict which is basically going to prevent distract strike from going further and causing more and more damage because we are living in difficult times these days so this hunger there's poverty there's every sorts of things so when a company is not working it's not only the company that gets affected but it's the children at home the wives and everyone else gets affected so the company had to intervene when it intervened obtained that interdict which said destruct the strike should be called off and yes indeed it was called off but as it was called off it was not in a peaceful manner because police said to intervene intervene people got injured others got to be taken to the hospital so it was not something that was nice but I want to tell you that afterwards management came back and issued each and every employee with a final written warning especially the employees who were involved but let me put it this way especially the employees who are under the organization of numsa because it was that Union which was basically working I mean a Toyota and then all of all of the employees got those final written only and then I also received the final eating warning why simply because the Judgment of the Court did not judge individuals however it judged the union to say the union was at fault at fault for engaging in an unprotected strike so in other words that strike was very much illegal so as a result everyone had to be given that final written warning I also received when my manager came to me and said this is your final written warning I was like surprise shocked and thinking of all the sacrifices that I'm making for the company and sometimes I even have to skip church on Sundays and come and work for the company but now I happen to be the one also who is receiving that final written warning then I I didn't argue or dispute he just showed me sign here we know it that when we have received a final written warning we are human we make mistake each and every day so I would make one mistake then I'm out of the gate so I went back to my office but when I was there I was in grief I was crying crying to the Lord that why me Lord that I'm facing such a thing and yet I also remembered that at some stage I asked my pastor to pray for me at work and I then started to think of that situation differently I looked at the issue of shetric meshech and abedniko that they were faced to go into the fear In fairness however the mighty hand of God also helped them to go through it without being banned without being harmed in that fairness later when everyone had received those final written warnings people were called again for the second time to say you've been involved in that strike but you were seen carrying some dangerous weapon you were seen blocking cars you were seen doing this and that which is illegal and therefore now we're giving you a notice so that notice basically saying that they need to come before the disciplinary hearing and the end of it it's going to be a dismissal I'm standing before you saying that about 40 already are already facing dismissal and this week there's another ones who are going to be facing dismissal but late I think last week if I'm not mistaken um my manager called me and said to me come come to my office and then I came to his office and then he said to me uh Zippo I understood understand that have we've given you the company has given you a final written warning and I would like to say that on behalf of the company the company sincerely apologizes to you and we would like to reject that um that [Applause] that final written warning and remember it's not only the final written warning so they had said that we are even taking the eight days that there was strike because you were a member of the um of the Union I joined that Union because of my father and mother my mother is uh 85 my uh father 90 no one bought it the wrong way my mother is 90 the older one and my father is 85 years so there's a funeral cover which was attached to that so I couldn't really drop that Union because I was holding on to that my parents are still alive so they said we're giving you back even those days we're going to pay you for those days so amen [Music] so I want to say glory to God because this God if you think that we are standing before a mountain you know a mountain it can be physical as you know it the mountain is physical however I'm saying anything that makes you not to see on the other side is actually a mountain if you thinking today that what am I going to eat tomorrow what am I going to do tomorrow how am I going to feed my children it's a mountain but God has promised that as lead if you've got as little as a mustard seed is able to move your Mountain so he has moved mine and I thank him glory to God Amen thank you praise God Amen God bless you [Applause] if you have never been faced with the final written warning and 40 people are dismissed and 40 more are coming you will not understand that and you have a family to feed and then God reverses that and for the eight days you have not been going to work while people are talking they say we're going to pay you that's the god that we sell amen praise God I'm going to ask brother and delay to come and briefly share with us is testimony amen God bless your Saints amen my testimony is almost exactly like the brothers women I am about two years ago I was actually suspended at work they said I've committed fraud and that was a false accusation of course then in that during that time six months later they came back to me and said no we have withdrawn those charges amen so after that they just put another charges now they fabricated new charges told me that a and I've misused the state vehicle State resources and everything amen now I went back home they didn't revoke that suspension amen so during that time I was stressing there's depression and literally I we I we also had a challenges when it comes now going to church because I was in Pretoria at that time amen so the devil was just attacking me all the hallway amen so now about to just to cut this testimony short amen this place is not easy to stand so about um three months ago we started coming here amen that's when we were always blessed and we were still praying for the situation amen and just two weeks back when the pastor was preaching about God is not ashamed lean not on your own understandable that's when he just mentioned my situation exactly as it was it just said you know they can falsely accuse you at work so if and not continue correct me but but um if they falsely accuse you if and they continued and continued and just said yes I'm talking to you right now I don't know who you are but I'm talking to you and like I was looking at my wife now saying tell the pastor or something what's happening here but later I realized that it was the Holy Ghost speaking to my situation amen and it was on Wednesday on Friday that week I received a call from work to say come on Monday and get your verdict amen I remember it was now two years going for three years I think so Monday I went there sitting that Big Board Room never spraying my wife praying at home and I'm glad to tell you a Believers that all charges were dropped against you know nothing so I would like to thank the Lord for that amen lean not into thy own understanding amen praise the Lord praise God Amen you see it's the same testimony God is not ashamed [Applause] so I on that on that service I actually say I don't know who I'm talking to but I'm very sure this is for somebody I said God will not will not stop them to falsely accuse you they'll falsely accuse you and God will not stop for the meeting for you to be called you will be called for that meeting and I said God will allow you to be sitting on that table and they'll be sitting there with your verdict but right at that moment God is not ashamed because he wants to see your attitude as you're going through the trial and if you are here and you have the same situation like the preacher said on Wednesday we do not negotiate with terrorists can you say Amen we do not negotiate with devils okay I'm not preaching let's stand up on office and it's a blessed Sunday we have got Pastor Talent from Days of the voice Fellowship in Uganda uh very wonderful men of God I spent yesterday the whole day with him fellowshipping I really loved him it's love at first sight and you know when we were talking he started reminding me of the number of people that I know and he knows and we are connected to these people and it's just amazing that the trip that I went to Ireland to preach at the youth meeting when I got there Pastor Marais told me there's a young brother that was supposed to come and preach these meetings and he was supposed to come from Uganda but unfortunately he's not making it and then I only learned that it was actually him so we were supposed to have met a long time ago but I believe we met before even the issue of Ireland we met before the foundations of the world it's a very seasoned man of God you know in the fellowship you can contact the spirit of a man the maturity in which he you know Converses and handles the scripture it's amazing what God has done through his ministry he established two assemblies in Ethiopia and is Ugandan then after that he then moved down to Uganda where he's established the fellowship which is pastoring right now and I believe it's just the beginning of what God is doing in his life we want him to know that we appreciate him and we want to draw as much as we can from the gift of God by amening the word and you know usually I know after the service the anointing will be just too much and we won't be able to make comments but if he leaves please he must take our greetings with to Uganda tell them we appreciate you God has got a witness in South Africa and we are so great glad that God has got a witness in Uganda brother blessed has been his friend you know they've been driving up and down together taking him to the hotel and we appreciate you so much brother blessed you know he's doing a good job when I see these young brothers that are married doing the right thing I am happy because we know that uh you know we've got a replacement for deacons and trustees by the grace of God when they are aging we have got a new crop that is coming in and the future is secured amen so while we're in there you sing a song that he actually wanted to sing so maybe if you start it then you finish it off there is a rest I must run amen keep me through [Music] Lord Jesus Keep Me true Hallelujah [Music] [Music] give him to be true [Music] [Music] there is is lift your hands to him foreign [Music] there is a race there is [Music] it is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] alive One More Time Lord give me true Lord Jesus [Music] Jesus can be true [Music] [Music] oh Hallelujah worship him thank you Jesus there is a race ahead of us we must run this race and we must win this race Hallelujah everything is working in our favor Lord Jesus because you're on our side we're more than conquerors Lord Jesus through Christ that defeated hell death on the grave and we are here this morning Lord Jesus lift up your name in the name above all names we are here to say Lord we have reported to duty oh God that he will come down and revive us one more time father then you come and O Lord assure us one more time that you are with us you are the one that called us and you did not call us to fail you called us all further to overcome to win this battle to win this race ahead of us Lord we keep the service to you all over Deliver us we will go into the reading of the word the preaching of the word father as the people receive your word Lord Jesus we desire that your holy spirit will be present Among Us it's our desire this morning Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ we ask him amen amen you may be sitting for just a moment I just want to greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus it's a blessing to be here I was here on Friday we are here on Friday together and I'm sure that the Lord encouraged Us in the few words we were able to share I'd like to appreciate uh Reverend mahere for the invitation to come and be with you here at benoni City Tabernacle he is hard of Even in our country a few Brothers have been sending little Snippets of his summons and so that's the first time I I saw him and and so I had not even heard of him so I just saw and I was like yeah this preacher is uh is hammering the gospel really really well the way I believe it and so I'm happy to meet him and now I can even call him my friend it's a blessing amen yesterday we had a wonderful time at home with his precious wife sister Mary we I I told I told them that I I ate my best meal in South Africa since I had come and so I appreciate her so very much do you appreciate sister amen [Applause] brother blessed brother Luca we appreciate you all now um like he said he is a friend of many of our friends and uh so but somehow the Lord knew how he would be able to meet Pastor side ministered for at a convention in Kampala where I also happened to minister and and so after the meetings later on he would you went ahead to tell me that he would want us to come and take meetings in Zimbabwe in Guero but they told me before you come to us there is another wonderful man of God I'd like you to bypass and visit them and be with them and so that's how we were able to be linked up with a reverend my Harry and to be here but I want to say it is all planned by God way back before the foundation of the world and I know that he has something for us this morning shall We Stand and read the word I want to bring greetings from our fellowship days of the voice Fellowship in Kampala my family the fellowship they all send their regards amen the service the way it has been going the song leader the songs he has sung the testimonies that we have had it's all been a preamble of what we are going to talk about and what I'm going to speak to you on this morning is when the devil thought he had won and so brother I don't know your names but when the devil thought he had won Hallelujah then actually he realized he had lost praise the Lord let us take our Bibles through the Book of Genesis chapter 3 verse 1. now the serpent was most subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yeah has God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and a woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the Middle East of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall he touch it lest he died and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God has forgot that know that in the day he eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and he shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did it and gave also unto her husband with her and he did it and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they had that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons shall we speak to the Lord for just a moment Lord Jesus we have read a portion of your word once again no doubt in this church and being Believers of this message this is a portion where we have read many many times but father we are asking you oh God one more time to just come and give us inspiration Lord let your spirit oh God come and overtake us that we will speak only what you want us to speak this morning come and overtake me overtake the people and let us all be in one channel where we shall hear from you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen be seated please so no doubt you have a wonderful Pastor a wonderful man of God a wonderful preacher so I can never preach close to how we can preach but this morning I I want you to know that we are all different and we are all special before the Lord just like you're all different from one another balam said that God has a flower garden and you see if God had all you know the flowers red it would be redundant and do not look nice if all of them were white or if all of them were black but God made sure that he is a god of variety he puts black red yellow you know white and then it's a flower garden and it looks beautiful so um you know God called him and he has a powerful Ministry we all want to sit under it and listen but this morning the Lord has fallen on me to speak to you so bear with me and let us see what the Lord will have for us this morning amen now when the devil thought he had won of course my theme is a generation of Overcomers and here we we start out here in Genesis and this story is very common to us this was one of the teachings that excited me when I first came to the message when I really knew that the church actually had many things that they did not understand many things that we can only understand when we believe the message of the hour there are many things that they teach out there in a perverted way you know in a confused way but there are certain things that you can actually even never be able to understand even they can't even try to come close unless they are actually exposed to this message of the hour and this is one of those teachings and I've had some people trying to downplay the teaching on the serpent seed and and you know we don't need it it's not important but let me tell you the teaching on the serpentine actually opens and unlocks the whole Bible and the whole Plan of Redemption and the whole reason why God had to come down in the form of man and die for us on the cross so here we see that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman has God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and of course we know that the serpent did not begin in the garden as we progress we'll be able to see where he started but God gives the word to man and indeed God gave the word to man when he created man in his own image man had the word and so man kept the word and he knew that there were many trees in the garden of course I always tell people that there were three categories of trees there were the trees like the uh the mango trees the uh you know these other trees that you know are good for food and you know physical food and that that was one category but there were other two categories of trees that were in the middle of the garden and the Bible says one of them was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and another one was the tree of life now but the manam said in the church edge book that Jesus Christ is the tree of life actually he was the man of life because he came actually there's no other man that came and spoke like Jesus spoke when Jesus came and said I am the way I am the truth I am the life so Jesus was literally declaring to the people that I am the Tree of Life I am the man of life and by the bottom said if Jesus was the man of life if the if the tree of life was a man was a person then that means also the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is also something else it's just figurative it's a figurative language and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was Saturn was the devil who came down to the Garden of Eden to deceive now God had given man the word and he told him you can eat of every other tree but he told him but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil this one you shall not eat of it so man passed down now who had the word man and then Man passed the word down to his wife so now the wife also had the word and she believed the word and you know it was one church it was one family of Believers but here the serpent came to the woman you know and then beguiled her you know the you know maybe uh Adam was somewhere in the garden doing his uh his normal work that he used to do and and you know the devil was like the Bible says he knew when and how to meet what he wanted the devil whatever he was doing whatever actually the devil does is on purpose and so he came to Eve because Eve had the facility that he needed in order to accomplish his vision and so he came to the woman and beguiled her and the woman you know gave in and when she accepted to eat of this tree of course we know how she was able to be overtaken because she added on the word and when you add on the word then the devil is able to take off of the word and then he's able to add afflictions on your life and of course you are on the ground of the devil and now here we see that when she accepted to each of these three when she accepted to the moment the devil thought he had won actually the devil thought he had won now the victory of the devil is always the stepping stone of God is great works Brothers these two brothers can be able to tell that when a devil thinks he has Victory that's actually when God I want to say this is the beginning the victory of the devil is always the stepping stone of God of God is great works to him this was the end of the beginning but to God this was just the beginning of the end did you hear what I said to the devil Hallelujah he thought well now I let me go down and confuse the creation of God let me go down and confuse the domain of man that God had pressed on Earth and he thought this is going to be the end of everything that God had envisioned but actually to God Amen God knows all things God knows your life even God knows what you do not know when you thought you were failing that's when God was saying that things are starting to work out in your life you see to the devil this was the end of the beginning but to God this was just the beginning of the end things were just beginning to the devil things were ending but to God things were just beginning and you know the battle actually started in heaven in Revelation chapter 12 verse 7 he says and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out did you hear that phrase cast out that old serpent called the devil and Saturn which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him now this battle was the Battle of angels this battle started in heaven and it was raging in heaven but this battle I want to say the Battle of angels became the Battle of man that this battle is still raging today this battle is between two great forces you see Lucifer thought that he will um I'll say it in a way in the words about the banham when he talks about the two word forces the message the greatest battle ever thought he says now that's the two great forces that's coming together right now they are battling they are battling right here in the building right now right now even right now did you know just now even when you're in church right now the battle actually goes on you see it says they battled day by day with you every Force there are two forces you know as you go on at your place of work as you go on to run your daily errands or when you're at home or when you're at work or if you're a student and you are at school actually this battle continues raging on in your life in your mind you might not realize that something is going on but we are actually walking between two great forces and we are battling Within These two great force but the badam says we battle day by day and this you know these two great forces start and following you along that great big kingly priest Goliath trying to scare the liver out of you how many have been scared before and you went through something and you thought that you will not be able to sail through or you not be able to overcome and have found many people many times who feel oh how can I overcome you know how can I receive the Holy Ghost how can I keep you know defeating the enemy how can I keep Victory and I do not know how to keep the victory because you know they are tempted and they backslide they attempted and many of them their greatest fear is to fear backsliding fear backsliding and others fear hell let me tell you as a believer of this message you should never fear hell did you know that hell is not a portion of Believers our goddess fear right now is not hell because hell is not my portion I do not believe this message to go to hell let others fear hell but as as far as I'm concerned I am here to overcome I was born on purpose God has a purpose for my life and as I'm speaking to you I'm actually speaking to myself God has a purpose when he called you he called you with a purpose and that purpose was not good to go to hell but that purpose was actually to go in the rapture the bride whatever you are you are thinking about the Rapture even when you are down in the valley you are thinking about the Rapture even when you're going through a trial you are thinking about the rapture I cannot fear you know that our backslide no you know the Bible I think in the book of Mikhail he says Rejoice not against me or my enemy when I fall down I shall arise when I sit in darkness the Lord will be a light unto me why why because as a Believer whenever you are you are in the hands of God Jesus Christ said father all that you have given me I in my hands and no one can black them out let me tell you predestination is greater than we thought it is we are in God's hands and we are walking Hallelujah in the past which he has favored for us before time Hallelujah and you know the devil has that greatly great Goliath he tries to come and scare the river but the balance says they will leave out of you and then he says he's right and then he says but God tell your neighbor but God he says you are fortified Hallelujah if you believe what I'm saying just say Amen you are fortified I am fortified can you put your mouth I am 45. amen with the gospel I want to say with the message I am fortified with the message of the hour Hallelujah no matter whatever does the message is a fortification to a Believer who knows who they are he says we are fortified with a message with the gospel with the word of Truth around your lion and it says glory and he says preacher that's what it is helmet of salvation The Shield of Faith the sword waving it in your hand and he said and he says Saturn I'm coming to meet you hallelujah oh my who can preach with me today Saturn I have this sword I have this message in my hands Satan I am coming to meet you Saturn I am coming to meet you I am no longer going to be a slave of fear I am coming to meet you because I have a sword in my hands oh my my listen to what he's saying he says you meet you meet me in the name of science you made me the name of culture you made me the name of organization you made me the name of this or that or the other but I made you in the name of the Lord God of Israel I'm coming right after you he says give way every death itself can't stand there chop a hole right through it with the sword you have I am not giving an inspirational speech I'm recording for you the message of the hour foreign is our inspiration hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you we don't need to listen to the inspirational speakers Hallelujah when you read the message when you hear the message you receive inspiration Hallelujah even when you are down you now begin to feel like you have big great big muscles amen you have eaten something because the world is our inspiration so let me tell you one time when you're down Castle when you're feeling depressed or when you're feeling difficult when you're feeling bad play the tape listen to the message go to church Hallelujah even when you're feeling bad this morning I want to say you're in the right place right now because God is here to inspire you by the word Hallelujah and he says we are commissioned to cast out what certain brains he says suddenly's Army brings diseases it's an army at all these two great forces and if you're hanging with me I'll not be very long this morning I promise you I might not be long but maybe Christ might be long I don't know say suddenly his army brings diseases and God this Army is commissioned to cast them out amen there you are every time Satan throws any on unto you God is Army is to cast it out amen cast it out where is God's Army this morning do we have got his army in benoni it's not only the pastor amen is the pastor the preacher the deacons they believe that the sister there you are God is great big army the honor we spoke about as an invisible Army which the devil cannot defeat whenever a god whenever the devil brings on diseases amen God is amen I want to say we are under a commission to cast him out that's the very technique that God used Southern used the army of Destruction to disbelieve God's word and set him up a better Kingdom than Michael hard and God did what cast him out God is method is to cast out the evil and you'll bear with me this morning I'm used to be interpreted so sometimes I I speak and I wait for The Interpreter to interpret so I have to get used to preach without interpretation Hallelujah and when Reverend maheri comes to kampal I'm sure he will suffer the same problem because he will not be waiting for The Interpreter to interpret for him listen he says and set him up and Michael hard and God cast him out goddess method is do you have it there look at it look at it it says what is goddess method let us all say it Hallelujah that is God is Merced is to cast out evil cast and reasoning cast on superstitions cast don't worry cast on diseases cast down sin amen you are above it you are resurrected in Christ Jesus setting in Heavenly places with every devil under your free [Applause] [Music] with every demon or wolf worry under your feet with every demon of joblessness under your feet with every demon of depression under your faith with every demon of disease under your faith Hallelujah [Applause] if he starts to stick his head in there what Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord I want you to turn with me to the Book of Ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13. and see what he says down there about this Saturn that we are speaking of thou has been verse 13. in Aiden The Garden of God excuse me and every preacher's Stone was thy covering the satyas topaz and the diamond the burial the Orcs The Jasper they suffer they aim around and the kabank on gold the workmanship of the tablets of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created now here he's speaking of it began by saying that you were in Eden the Garden of God so whoever is talking about is somebody who was in Eden all right but then also as the future verse 13 he says he was created so this is a creature now though at thou at the anointed cherub that covereth and I have said this so now here also on also in addition he is a Carib he's an angel thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked down up and down in the midst of the stones of fire praise the name of the Lord now Satan was created how many believe that Saturn is a creature of God but Satan was walking up and down the stones of fire in heaven upon the holy mountain of God amen Saturn said that he wanted to you know lift himself up above the stars of God he wanted to make another kingdom greater than what Michael had Hallelujah and of course we know that Michael is there is the Angelic uh is is there is there Michael is what I would say the manifestation of Christ in the Angelic realm and and you see that Michael had a great Kingdom and Lucifer wanted to overtake that Kingdom so he can have a greater Kingdom and then we see that as we read here in the book of or did we read that in the Book of Revelation I think we did not read it praise the name of the Lord yeah yeah we did read it in the Book of Revelation chapter 12. he says that you see there was way in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon oh my and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and so that great Dragon was cast out hey man that's right by the banana says that's what believers do amen God that's his formula he casts house demons he casts out spirits in the same way he cast out that demon that's something that old serpent called the devil Saturn which deceives the whole world and he was cast down to the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and now when you come down here he says he was an angel he was in heaven he was great until iniquity actually was perfect until iniquity was found in him did you see the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he had knowledge but he also had good and evil but the Bible says he was perfect until iniquity was found in him so he he he had Perfection he had a good but also iniquity was in there so the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is certain Hallelujah and when God said don't eat of it he meant do not listen what are we doing right now we are eating we are eating the word we are eating the bread of life and Jesus amen wants us to keep eating eating he told the disciples if you don't eat amen My Flesh and you don't break my blood you are not a part of me Hallelujah Jesus wants us to eat the Tree of Life amen they don't have access to the Tree of Life the rest of the world doesn't have access to the tree of life but he that will overcome in our generation Hallelujah I want to say this message is the is the axis to the Tree of Life Hallelujah now when you receive this message and believe it amen and sit under the word what are you doing you are eating of the Tree of Life that is why the Bible says amen we have already passed from death and to life did you know you can only die once and you die the moment you accepted to die to yourself you are accepted to be born again of what of The Incorruptible word The Incorruptible seed of God you can never die again Hallelujah and then he said there is there a for now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who work not after the flesh but walk after the spirit Hallelujah I want to tell you this that the believer will never never there is no time they believe I will never walk before the Judgment thrown is that hard for you do you believe that I will never walk before the white Throne judgment to be judged according to my works because the Bible has said now now there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ so you see I am not because of this message I am not worried about hell because of this message I am not worried about death because of this message I am not even worried about the day of judgment why because all of it has happened for me here on Earth I have died on Earth I've been judged on Earth Hallelujah and the Bible says I died amen and now I'm born again of The Incorruptible seed so the only thing I'm waiting for is my victory is my reward with Jesus Christ is coming with me yes there will be there will be uh the Judgment seat of Christ but that is not the white Throne judgment for the believer and see friends then here we see that the anointed he was anointed he was created and sudden by perverting and be guiding the woman to eat of the tree he thought that he had won I imagine when the devil was cast out of heaven and then he came down on the on the Earth and he had devised a plan you know when you're attacking a fortified Kingdom because brother said we are fortified if you are attacking a fortified Kingdom you have to be intelligent and you have to know the act of War so when Saturn came he he really I love this message he really had he thought he had the Art of War you know he tried to fast take over the Kingdom in Heaven and he failed terribly he felt terribly I believe even in heaven when he took his throne and he sat and he was like yeah now I'm going to you know the attack and three quarters of heaven and he was like oh yeah now I've I've arrived I've taken over God now then soon enough hey hey hey hey Hallelujah the one I thought yes I have overtaken actually is now overtaking me and the Bible says he was thrown down to the ass yeah he came o my good lord the devil came to the eyes as a loser now what tells you that he can win in your life he can never win in my life because he's a loser to begin with the reason why the devil is in hell is because he's a loser Hallelujah and he thought he had won in heaven and then he realized he lost it and then and then all of a sudden when he came down here on the earth he had he had to strategize so he told his little demons of course they were angels to begin with but now they have become demons so he told his little demons now let us strategize so he began you know sending one I don't know the the names of the Demons because you know but I know a few Angels so now here those demons I don't know maybe you know you can you think of any so he began called one by one now you take that one you got the other side you got the other side and as for me I have a plan don't worry so he looked at that Beast like creature that Beast which looked like almost like a man and brother said it had a place for a soul but it never had a soul that's the only difference that Beast had with us otherwise it was almost like us it could talk it could think it could and the devil saw that faculty that it had and and even said you see it it is sperm his seed could mingle with that of a of mankind and actually create a baby and the devil knew that so he was like okay now for me I know what to do he did what he did in the terms of gadara you know this was a creature we as human beings we were created with as free moral agents we are free more agents but that creature I don't think it was because he did have a soul so as it was just there in the garden he immediately what's happening so it began working as a vampire going into Eve did the goddess say we should not eat now now the the religious world the religious world now you see why why the message is true because what the religions are telling us cannot add up it had to be this and you see they put pictures up with a snack coil on a tree speaking to if that is alive from the Devil Himself Hallelujah the devil is trying to hide his Beginnings so that he doesn't arrive at his end but let me tell you when the devil thinks he has won amen that's when God comes down and raises a standard against the enemy Hallelujah and so right there at that moment he began to speak to Eve and Eve was shocked yeah he always knew that this serpent was was intelligent but today it was different he was speaking words that were confusing so he was like okay since I know this happened you know I wanted to differentiate The Serpent and the devil now see some people confuse that here was Mr serpent a beast like a creature with four is it for limbs right two hands two legs it was not crawling it was walking with it's to fit it had a mouth like yours it had a body almost 100 99 percent like yours and a mind even sharper than some of the human beings today and so and so as it came and you know was walking and talking to Eve the Bible says Eve was beguiled now to be guile you know that this is a um in in a in a an immoral way and Eve was overtaken and Eve was excited at the words that the serpent was telling her but you see what was the sin people ask me what was the original sin what was the sin that was done you see the sin that was done is the sin that many people are doing today it is unbelief of the truth the moment that Eve had what the devil was saying that very moment she had to say no I don't believe it period I believe what my husband told me that God said and that set us it but the moment Eve considered and negotiated with the devil that very moment she sinned before God and that is your original sin and when she sinned when she and believed the word from that very moment then other things began to creep in that's when she realized the other things you know when somebody believes the word and it goes we have seen them they say well why the reason why I left the message the moment I believe the word they go out there you begin to see them on beaches with shorts there were men saying they are spiritual but now they are on shorts showing all their hairs and the women are in in bikinis and they say they're putting makeup they're saying oh we were in prison ah so why did they say they begin to go to adultery fornication and drinking so these are not sins these are all fruits of sin sin is unbelief so now the Bible says that eve took what took of the fruit of the tree and that was adultery Hallelujah the Bible says hallelujah so is the way of another woman what does she do she eats and wipes her mouth and says I've done no evil hey that's what if did amen and when evil amen went on with the serpent and then she came back to her husband and said look here darling I found something wonderful and then Adam said oh yeah oh really tell me about it and then the Bible says finally after Adam was told about it he also did it with how praising him of the Lord so it was an action done right there but I want you to see when the devil had excuse me when the devil had injected his seed into the human race he thought he had won Hallelujah he thought he had won because he thought you know he had made a very good strategy on how he was going to come in on how he was going to you know go around and try you know you know the devil does that too even today he comes in you know you know what brother I'm saying he said and you here in benoni are really a wonderful sweet group of people I have enjoyed to be with you but then would say you know you're now one one big great sweet group but the devil can bring in somebody and then he comes and he shoots him with some poison stuff and he begins to go around you know begins to go around he says but you see when you see that man or that woman love them and how pray for them that God will change them and and if they are not changed then of course they will be put away from among us but you see I believe I always say the other part is good of putting away but I always believe that this word this message has power to change how many believe that that's why we must have love one for the other even when you feel that someone is not spiritual love them brother love them sister God is able to change them this message is power and so then when the enemy came in like that and he was like he was now within the womb of Eve in our language we say okulata you know when somebody does something and he he has really scored with flying colors he even sits and he begins to shake his leg that's I believe that's what the devil did he began to okay come on sing for me because you know these were great singers great singers so you see it sing for me but you know they were great singers but actually our God is the one who anointed them to sing so he can anoint us to sing better than them I believe that so you see where they were there and and they were they were like oh yeah we have really oh yeah oh what did you do oh I went and did this and then I met Adam busy the other side oh yeah you did well what about you oh yeah I was sleeping the other gate oh yeah what about you and then the devil now gave his testimony as for me hey I have finished the mankind I've finished the human race nowhere this was just so easy actually it was easier than I thought and then the demons told them come on come on give you the testimony and then he began say you do you know what I did the very life of Adam the very flesh of his flesh the very part of him the very part of his bones now actually She's Mine She's mine I have taken her over and do you know we have taken over the world and they began rejoicing they began shouting they began dancing they began you know but they did not know that at that moment as they thought they are the one it was just the beginning for God hallelujah God was just fixing to do something right there and I believe you know some people say some people who became artists actually they begin to say right there they say aha so who created the devil they said God okay now when God was seeing this happening why didn't he stop the devil and then they begin to make some people doubt but either way why didn't God stop the devil he could have stopped him but he didn't want to stop him because he was just fixing to begin the music was just starting Brothers the music was just starting do you know how bad it is if the music is just starting and you're just getting into the hype of the music and then just and then power goes off Lord shedding so what is that now you see so God did not want to Lord said he said the music is just starting come on play on play on I'm fixing to do something Hallelujah the high octave is coming up I'm fixing to do something and all the onions were like come on let us go and stop him one would let me go and just bring water and sweep everything said no wait I know I also have a plan the devil thought it was the end Hallelujah the beginning but God knew it was the beginning you know the beginning of his end and Adam knew here is the other part that I really love but the manam says that Adam knew what he was doing and I will also put it in this maybe for somebody who might ever listen to this who is not a believer of the message yet you see if the serpent was a snake why then was their need for God to cast it and make it crawl crawl on the ground so you see the crowding on the ground came later after the cast before that it was an upright creature and so he lost he lost in the Garden of Eden he lost in in heaven he lost in the Garden of Eden what makes you think he will win now you see so he was wrong Saturn by perverting or begotten the woman to eat of the tree he thought he had won but he was wrong the woman was a part of a greater purpose let me let me let me put this in here Adam was a son of God in the image of God and here Eve was a part of Adam now I believe well Eve did whatever she was doing she was counting on Adam that's why as soon as Adam arrived she was like yes I was counting on you honey come I tell you what I've done and right there she explained everything and Adam would have said ah what have you done do you know the magnitude of what you have done you have killed my entire and you now it's you has done so you go and die you are going to hell now go to hell I don't have anything to do with you but you see Adam was like okay this is what you have done I mean he felt pain he felt bad but he was like it's all right I know what to do I know what you know Adam was in the image of God he was like God himself it's just like God told the angels I know what to do next I'm sure Adam told Eve I know what to do just leave it for me so I have to partake of this if Adam did not do that the entire human race would have been destroyed God would not have made another Eve but God had to redeem Adam just like Adam had to redeem Eve God had to redeemed Adam I wanted to I wanted to hear each in the world himself excuse me now in the message the efficient Church age um he says now I know in answering one question another one is up to come up and people ask if Eve fell that way what did Adam do for God lays the blame on Adam and then he says that is simple the word of God is forever settled in heaven and I want to say also the word of God about your life is forever settled in heaven hey Hallelujah you brother who came up I'm selling on your name but you you know that when when the pastor was preaching and he called you out what do you think that was it wasn't the man of God was God he had already settled down in heaven even before the foundation of the world and he wanted you to go through what you went through so that you can have confidence in God the next time the word of God is forever settled in heaven before one Speck of us of stopped us towards man don't tell me that this is a seventh grade student this is more than that this is God speaking to us that word God is law was there exactly as it was written in our Bible now the word of God teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she is an adulterous and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true in Aiden and as it is was true when Moses wrote it in the law the word can't change tell somebody the word can't change Adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway did you hear what the prophet said let me read it for you again Adam took her back he wasn't supposed to do that but Adam took her back and and then he says he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself that's why I tell you you married Brothers you must be willing to take the responsibility of your wife as a matter of fact brother says you see you will answer for your wife but your wife will not answer for you so that is responsibility when you get married you receive responsibility you have to make sure your wife is right with God yes it is your responsibility just like mother you have to ensure that your children are right with God you see it is a hierarchy that God has blessed and it's a Palmer it can be changed it's the word and so Adam you see here when we take the vows we say in our language is it sounding the same even in your language how is it spoken in a someone tell me one of the South African languages yeah yes sister what's your language okay is it South African what is it in your language oh that's a bit long for me every every where that that's what we say you say I'll be with you in good and bad in Good and Evil I'll be with you you know when you're sick when you're aware I'll be with you when you are back or when you are poor or when you are rich I'll be with you you know that's not that the voice will take and I want to say here as a husband and the wife you must by all means in all circumstances keep those vows because it is made before the Lord and so we see here that Adam was also ready Adam was willing to keep his vows Hallelujah when she's seen he knew what he was doing but he did it anyhow why because he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself he would not let her go I'm talking about Adam and Eve but I'm seeing something else he would not let her go so if conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he saw the human race into sin that he might have her Eve for he loved if you want to have problems with two younger people who are in love try to separate them that's when he was even if you're a relative they will forget you that's when you will know that these people really maybe are meant for each other because they are willing to do everything on anything but abandon spoke of Romeo and Juliet and you see how they had this love for one another you know he would do anything to to to you know because of the love he had for hand she the same way so now you see Adam you know when he found Eve had sinned Adam you know partook of the same thing that she had done but it did painfully because he knew he was going to plunge the whole human race into sin but he he knew also by doing what he did he had given over the whole human race but not without a redeemer there was also another Redeemer so now you know she had seen and she had gone through all that she went through but you see when Adam allowed her to to go through that time and you know he he came and he partook of the same thing and come here brother and and so he he put his arms around now they were both in the same situation and brother can you put your arm around me and and so as they walked they were naked at that moment and they walked and they walked and Adam was with Eve and then they went and hid somewhere in the thickets and they made some fig leaves and covered themselves with aprons and they were there Adam was there with Eve says my Eve I'm not going to let you go my Eve I love you so much my Eve I'm ready to lose it all for you my Eve I'm able to do anything even if the devil has won this time don't you worry I have your back let me tell you that was only a type and a shadow of what was about to come hey Hallelujah just like Eve had a redeemer Adam had a redeemer too Eve was a born of born flesh of Flesh of Adam but Adam was born of birth flesh of Flesh of God himself Hallelujah we are just when the devil thought he had won there was somebody else somebody else showed up I said somebody else showed up in the garden and then he heard a voice not calling Eve because he had somebody else to call her when I've seen it was Adam who showed up said if what have you done today can I tell you what I've done but in the same same way Hallelujah God showed up and he said Adam Adam where are they now and Adam was there and he said oh I'm right here don't worry now he has come just like I showed up for you he has showed up for me and everything is all right when the devil thought he had won to change love is a great thing Adam was willing to do anything to save a part of himself Hallelujah so Saturn the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil goes to the to Aiden after he was cast out of Heaven as we have seen I came to destroy to kill to steal everything in Adam's domain as I was studying I wrote this by inspiration I said these were words of Saturn he said if I can't take over your domain I will take over your son's domain this was Saturn speaking to himself about God if I can't take over your domain I'll go and take your son his domain sometimes when the devil defeat they could not defeat you he tries to that same demon which try to defeat you in your life and you overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony he comes down to your children and to try and torment them but let me tell you the same way you overcome those children will have to overcome Hallelujah one thing that I am so happy about is our God does not change the way he does things if we meet the same conditions that our parents made we will receive the same results Saturn did not know the sun is a part of the Father the father could never let a part of him die just just when he had started to think he had won like I said when he has started to think I think I've won this the table has changed questions and answers 59 he says everything that God does is perfect and eternal Hallelujah I am fearfully and wonderfully made oh I'm perfect at eternal [Music] did you notice he doesn't say when this happens and this happens and this happened then you are fearful and wonderfully made now he says you are fearful and one of remed even before anything has happened he said I loved Jacob and I hated before any of them did anything bad oh good oh good so there is none of the good that we do we must do the good but none of the good that we do is going to give us victory you understand you have to trust in a perfect God and this perfect God has revealed himself to us in our generation through the perfect world now if you receive that word and you believe it with all that is within you then that perfect God will make you perfect and he says and when God is very thoughts went out for a kingdom or people who would worship him then the results is eternal they can no more perish they can no more perish every word of God is eternal Jesus said heavens and Ash will pass away both Heaven and Earth may pass away but my words will never pass away they are Eternal with God and if he abide in me and my word in you we become a part of him his word part of his life for we are flesh of his flesh and born of his bones and life of his life then we can no more perish than God himself could perish that's why the Holy Ghost is listen whatever challenge that we as Believers in this relation Church age in this last day is going through he's not going to consume us how many believe we say Amen we are not going to be consumed Hallelujah I just paused a bit because I was reflecting on my life and I was like oh praise the name of the Living God no matter what trick contract the enemy laid against you it cannot consume you think about your own life and The Traps that the enemy has laid for you and each of them no you want to attack you want me to tell you that you went through no you went through because you were here so you went through you overcome so why do we hear the word we hear the word to remind us of who we are each time whenever we come because whatever is you are going to use to overcome is Right In You you see it's in you but you come here to be able to be reminded and to be inspired so that you can put that word to work to praise the name of the Living God now I want to show you that that same devil will continue on and I want to show you this through the life of Samson for just a moment Now read with me the Book of Judges chapter 16 verse 15. and she said unto him of course you know the story of Samson but we'll just go through a little bit he says and she said unto him how can thou say I love thee when thine heart is not with me thou has mocked me these three times and has not told me where in thy great strength of life and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with our words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death that he told her all his heart and said unto her there has not come a raised upon my head and for I have been a Nazareth unto God from my mother's womb if I bishop and then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man and when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the Lords of the Philistines saying come up these once for he has showed me all his heart then the Lords of the Philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand and she made him sleep upon his knees whenever I read this I Marvel he's a man a strong man a powerful man a man a child of God a man of God but listen he is sleeping on the laps of a prostitute and she made him sleep let does not live below our privileges Saints and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called from a man excuse me and she caused him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the Philistines be upon the Samson and they walk out of his sleep and said I will go out as the other times before and shake myself and he wished not that the Lord was departed from him but the Philistines took him and put his eyes and brought him down to Gaza put out his eyes and put him to Gaza and bound him with fetus of brass and he did grind in the prison house how bad their hair the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaving now Samsung 2 was behind the Enemy Lines if you have ever been behind the Enemy Lines you know what I'm talking about how many have ever been behind the Enemy Lines a few just a few all of us I believe have been behind the Enemy Lines when you were in a rock and a hard place the enemy had really Afflicted Samson he was vexed unto death finally Samson gave up his Birthright and at that moment you you remember how the devil tried he's the best to try and get to him try and get to him and you know the Assumption was a real man of God a real child of God he had given his heart to the light of Thor and his strength to God friends I believe we should give our strength and our heart to the Lord we should not divide this God wants everything everything you can give him you see especially to the young people that are in this Fellowship everything that you have everything that you can do give it to the Lord and when you do that you're going to watch how God will use you in a mighty way but the problem of it is we give God our strength for something else and then we put our heart on something else and that's this mistake that Samson did and Samson gave up his Birthright and at that moment when he gave it up uh ah the devil thought I have now won him I have now won him but Samson was a believer now remember I told you that as a Believer you can never be defeated by the enemy you will be delayed you beat the raid but you can never be defeated another song we've got the power in the name of Jesus we've got the power in the name of the Lord listen don't certain rages sing with me now we cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of an assumption was there one thing that Samson had amen right there was a seed of God what you have is a seed of God hallelujah even when the devil takes that seed and bodies it 20 feet under the ground that seed must grow that seed must come out and show that it has the life of the original and right there they never thought he had won the devil when he you know when you found yourself in a you know this kind of uh Graves of the Anglican Church Graves of sin some of you were in the graves of birds others went in you know this kind of graves of disco your disco you know you find you you find yourself dancing and sweating right there I don't know if anybody has ever been there others were in the graves of smoking you know others in the graves of alcohol they were the best alcoholics that Johannesburg has ever seen yeah we found ourselves in and the devil thought he had won but there was a seed of God in our souls the devil could not have defeated us and right there you see Samsung could not have been defeated and remember Samson was born for a purpose you were born for a purpose God is purpose for your life cannot be defeated amen when the devil thought he had won some Sons began to grow again he destroyed more Philistines than before Hallelujah I want to just give this declaration to you Hallelujah your hair is growing back again [Music] the devil thought when when he would confuse in our first doctrines he thought he had won but let me tell you with this message of the hour our hair is beginning to grow up again hallelujah our hair is growing up again Hallelujah we cannot be defeated we are the church triumphant we are washing the blood we are going to overcome why because we are the generation that has received thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord has not fail this message is not just another church we are not just another religion we are the bride of Christ in this generation we are the generation of Overcomer Saints Hallelujah I would have read your quote in once more but let's just carry on so I can bring you to a climax here let's open the Book of John Chapter 19 Verse 23. where he says then the soldiers reading about our lord Jesus then the soldiers went they had crucified Jesus took his garments and made four parts to every Soldier apart and also he's got now the court was woven was without seem woven from the top throughout they sit there among themselves let us not Rend it but because Lords for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which said they patted my Remnant among them and for my vesture they did castles these things there are for the soldiers did Imagine who was this he was our savior he was the savior of the world Amen just like just like Adam you know came down to rescue to rescue Eve Our Savior had come down to rescue Adam he had come to redeem Adam and his entire race which was now fallen in sin and when he came down the Bible says he came among his own but his own received him not and he was after he was bitten and you know he went through a lot of suffering and he went through the spattering him and and here now he is on the cross and they took off his garments and they cast lots on he to try and just make fun of it and they said now who will take who will have this they cut Castles On His Garment but who was it it was The Lord Of Glory the king of glory who was on that cross and he wasn't on that cross for any other reason he was on that cross just for you and me he was on that cross for the for other a better part of him just like Adam decided to partake of whatever he was doing did you know that the Bible says that Adam never sinned yes can somebody open for me for Timothy yes I wanted to read it for us if you can open it to anybody first Timothy chapter I believe it's chapter two all right are you there all right can you read us that part that portion which says that that Eve was in the transgression or something like that anybody there First Timothy chapter 2. all right nobody there yes brother you are there I wanted you to read it in your Bible so you can see this in the Bible yes anybody just read it which verse is that 14 okay yes oh the brother has it right here yes and Adam was not yes go ahead the Bible says that Adam never sinned he was not deceived how so Adam was not deceived but the woman who being deceived was in the transgression so that is so that is true it was the woman who sinned but remember that is a type because remember it was the woman that was deceived by the serpent so brother balam said that Adam did what he did he knew what he was doing he did not do it unconsciously he did it consciously he knew what I'm doing I had to do it in order to redeem my wife and this was typing God himself what he would do to redeem Adam when Jesus Christ came the Bible says he became can you get us that that verse brother he became sin the Bible did not say became a sinner no our Jesus did not sin but the Bible says he became sin so that we who are sinners can be able to get the righteousness of God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord you see it's the same same thing here and when Jesus Christ came here he came to take our place he came so that he can you know take up sin on his shoulders and that way he can be able to redeem us and so they cast loads and beat him up and now John 19 30 says when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost ha our friend the devil again thought he had won you know he was the one afflicting Jesus the whole time and Jesus was going through the pain and Agony and the suffering and the devil's like yeah I have him from the time when they arrested him in the garden the devil was right there watching let me now see today I have you today I have you you have been escaping there is one time they wanted to catch him and he just went through him through them so but this time the devil had also laid another strategy you see you remember you tried to catch him the other time when he went to fasting and and and you know he was trying to trap him and tell him if you were if you were the Son of God you turned these turns into bread if you're the Son of God and Jesus overcame him but he was like but is he the Son of God could he be the one because he was using the word if and I'm says because he was using if he wasn't too sure who he was Hallelujah and I want to say the devil is not too sure about who you are hallelujah praise the name of the Lord if he was sure he would not have bothered with you because he knows he cannot overcome and at that moment you know Jesus as he was at the Garden you know he the devil watched he said aha now I've used one of the one of one of his men to betray him now I am sure he's the one but let me see how he will be able to go through this this time I have him this time I have him as strategy has worked and and and under judah's brother Judas brother Judas came you know you know like you know how Catholics work when they are having their robes on see this is a Holy Ground because this is Jesus and by the way I always thought about brother Judas you know brother Judas was a real believer almost do you know do you know that it is brother Judas who was always there collecting money he was trusted he was a good brother he wasn't a bad brother after all he he was I mean we have trustees here these are people men who are trusted men of good character right brother Judas was a man of good character he knew how to handle money he knew he knew Jesus very very well and the other thing about brother Judas was that he had a burden he had a burden for the ministry he told Jesus Luke we could just sell this and you know give it to the poor and you know you know try to help the poor and you know he had a heart for maybe he was genuine about these things and also he had seen Jesus when you know Jesus was going through people just like that when they tried to catch him he had seen all that so he had seen too much to believe that Jesus can just Escape maybe he thought this is let me use this as an Avenue to get what I want so that I can be able to do something for my family or for something let me just but but you know I know Jesus will escape anyhow he's God he's God himself let me tell you don't negotiate don't negotiate because when the devil tries to make a negotiate like Judas negotiated he lost the battle you know so Judas came and he was walking you know he was a Believer a good brother Hallelujah and you know as he walked to Jesus and you know Jesus was standing right there brother and as he was standing there he looked at him and then he you know you know as you know he just came and Hallelujah God bless you master said and and then he looked at him so said oh this is how you betrayed the son of man with a kiss said at that moment he was like anyway I know he had to say that but even if I betrayed him first of all he has these disciples they have swords they will try to protect him even if they could not protect him he has power he has anointing he'll be able to do something about this let me stand aside and watch brother Peter brought it I think it was brother Peter he brought a sword and cut off one man's ear you can't take a master and then Jesus went down and he picked that ear as he was looking at that man and he put it back I believe brother Judas whatever he was like yeah yeah I knew it I knew it he's going to do Miracles here this is a miracle worker he's going to change everything and but you see he was being misguided he had negotiated with Saturn and and right there when he saw that happen and Jesus told you know the other disciples he that fights with the sword will die with a sword and at that moment the the Pharisees came and caught Jesus put chains on him and carried him away Judas was like I can't believe this but he did not know he had negotiated with Saturn and God bless you brother and at that moment the devil was like I tricked the Judas I tricked you and now this time I've got him forever I've won I've won and the devil's again through apartheid you know they are very good at throwing parties they always throw a party when they win when they think they have won you see but usually there but but is always the end in chaos you see their parties always end in chaos but whenever you come here in church and you throw a party you know we can throw a party too when we Rejoice under the water and shout and rejoice and clap our hands and sing Hallelujah that's a real party that does not end in chaos it ends in Deliverance it ends in God doing something in your life that's why you should never feel sorry when you come here and you release yourself and you shout and you rejoice you cry hallelujah amen something is happening while that is going on and right there the devil began to throw a party and and it was like yeah this time we have got him this time is in yeah so the demons he told them come on we've got him this time he we must not rest until his discipline these guys has died on the cross and then they took him and beat him and beat him and of course they took him before the judges and everything the devil was right there the whole time he was following was like I must not rest my number one priority is this guy he must die when he dies then I will know I have finished it but he did not know yes he might die all right but that is not the end that is the beginning wholesale always has it wrong whenever the devil thinks that he has won that's the time God comes on the scene and begins watching let me tell you you can read the Bible from front to back that is how God works Hallelujah you remember even the the time when brother Lazarus died same thing they never thought he had won but Jesus came and showed up on the very last minute Hallelujah and then we carry on here as I want to bring it to a climax so you see here John 19 30 and Jesus therefore had received Divine again he said it is finished and he bowed his head give up the ghost that put a smile on somebody in hell they're like yes yes thanks yeah but look John 19 33 says but when they came to Jesus and so that he was dead already they break not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forth with came there water and blood even in death he testified that all is well Hallelujah even in death as he died that water and blood which came out amen it was signifying salvation to signifying justification and sanctification amen there it was God himself women sending a testimony of his own death and the devil thought he had won when Jesus died he didn't know that he he was just the beginning this was not a Reformation this was a revolution it was a total damage to the kingdom of darkness and the whole Christian Empire is standing because of what happened on that cross Hallelujah we are here because of what happened on that cross oh I wish the devil knew but the devil did not know look what has happened because of what happened that day look at what is happening in South Africa here in benoni in Kampala all over the world because of what happened on that cross I wish the devil knew but he did not know it was just a beginning brother Hallelujah and I want to finish with this quote here well babadam says in the message uh glorified Jesus well I'll read one more but then he says here when Jesus died you're not Calvary for appropriation of our sins he died not just as a man but as seen none of his own but mine and your sin sent him to the regions of the Lost and I can see him when he died young on Calvary hanging between the malefacturers crying my God why have you forsaken me and when he gave up The Ghost and bowed his head his Spirit went and preached the spirits that were in prison that repaired they're not in the long suffering of the days of Noah the scripture says so now skip a beat and read this I can hear him say now he has reached the Peace of hell remember the Devils did what they threw a party they are rejoicing and enjoying yourself well we finished the man really the man everybody was like ah he really confused us the devil's like at one moment I thought I had I had him but I thought then again I lost him but this time I was there I would Nest the man's death they even pierced his side but the devil did not know while he thought he had won the tables were actually changing at that moment I can hear him say Saturn I just took the key and give it to the Apostle Peter for the kingdom of heaven but I come down to get the kiss of death and you are going to give them up which must have first which the devil must have Fest in hell that day imagine I wanted to think as they are throwing a party and rejoicing and I don't know which key they were singing that day where is the song leader which key is very good which is very high F sharp it must have been maybe an F sharp they were just enjoying and the music was going on and you know singing the you know the kind of demonic songs yeah we've got him yeah we have overcome him yeah Lucifer Lucifer is the man yeah he's still you know triumphant yeah they all hear us Justified yeah let everybody Rejoice yeah today is the day and as you know the kids were going up and music was like there he had a knock on the on the door and and brother said when he walked in he just bumped in and he came in and he told him Saturn I just took the key and I've given it to the Apostle Peter and now I have come down here in the air I need something from you I need a kiss of death I need a kiss of hell and you are going to give them up and I can see him reach over there and he said but wait a minute wait a minute there is a sin appropriation you remember you remember do you remember I caused the eve to sin do you remember because if the sin and the devil is trying to remind Jesus there is nothing you can do about this because I cause the eve to sin and therefore your kingdom yo your small kingdom here on Earth is done he did not know what Jesus did on the cross was actually coming Amen to bring Hallelujah a Redemption for the foreign Adam and his entire race and I am part of that race I am part of the church Royal father I have not come here to be overcome no I say no even Mercy itself on the cross say no I am not going to let you go I am not going to let you slip away you should not be afraid you must be redeemed you must overcome you must overcome Hallelujah and and you know and Jesus said just a minute just a minute I also have something to tell you I am the Virgin born son of God the devil that's the moment he knew oh I missed it long time ago that version Oh my God I remember I was even looking for that boy to kill him but I don't know how he escaped I remember oh my God and Jesus was standing there and he gave the announcement I am the Virgin born son of God hallelujah the price has been paid [Music] help me and preach with me and said the price has been paid the price has been paid my blood is still wet on calvary's Cross you can't Bluff the people anymore [Music] Hallelujah I have come to take over I have come to take over this is Jesus saying I have come I'm come to take over Hallelujah let me tell you this message has come to take over to take over hell to take over days to take over the craft of sin [Music] have come to take over see him reach over there and he Jack the keys off of his side and he hung them on his own side oh my God who has kids here oh my god do you have kids somebody has keys here oh yes this is very good my brother he took the case this word by the bottom said and I love demonstrating things and he took the case off of his side and he put it on his side Hallelujah this was you know you know this was signifying victory the devil thought he had won he had the case but Jesus grabbed them he says give me the kiss and he took the kiss and put on his side said now hallelujah hallelujah and he put it on his side getting near daylight he is going back he just starts up praise the name of the Lord I said praise the name of the Lord I want to say today to you even as we are approaching the commemoration of Easter Jesus has rose again [Applause] and he got the keys they are right by his side he had the keys for your problem brother he has the keys for your problem he consult even the impossible even what you did not think is possible he is more than ever we believe in a message a message Hallelujah that solves impossibilities how many believe that here oh Hallelujah this is so exciting the keys are by his side [Applause] Hallelujah in our country if someone has just bought a car we didn't used to drive until recently so now when someone has bought a car they usually had the key by their hand just go checking it and everybody was like ah this man is rich or foreign even one that did not have a car so what they decided to do they go and buy keys when they don't have a car let me tell you and I begin checking it around and they would use those kids to kind of appeal to girls this younger man is rich but actually when I just bought that key from the shop somewhere they don't have a car but our Jesus is not bluffing he really has the case he's the mighty conqueror Hallelujah and it can conquer your sugar diabetes he can conquer your trouble he can conquer your disease he can conquer your problem hallelujah praise the name of the Lord oh my can you give him a shot of praise can you give him a shot of victory Hallelujah Hallelujah I said Jesus is here right now when the devil thought he had won amen and he had tormented you and taken you through all the toys and suffering this is the moment this is the time when God is showing up on the scene by the preaching of the word to settle free you remember you told them lose them and let them go lose them and let them go I believe Jesus is saying the same thing today and he says there is the Conqueror in the message the Great and Mighty conqueror there is the Conqueror you talk about jacking off aprons and waving it people say we are crazy because we shout because we run because we scream because we holler let me tell you we do that in message churches why they have never failed the Victorious vibrations of Heaven [Music] they say we do that they can't understand it because they have never felt what we felt they have never experienced what we experienced Hallelujah sometimes you see a pastor preaching jumping up shouting running around let me tell you he has experienced vibrations from heaven oh Hallelujah and he says the battle is over our Great Mighty conqueror has won every Victory and he stands alone this morning untouched why don't you give him praise Hallelujah [Applause] at the moment when the devil least expected you to retaliate that's the exact thing and timing God intended for you to overcome God is giving you now strength in your weakness at the time of your strength your rise into the challenge right now at a time when you thought you have been defeated there is nothing you can do about this situation and condition in your home in your life you know I'm telling you this is the time for you to rise to the challenge of the Ark because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when you thought you could never receive the Holy Ghost that's their oh [Music] I'll give you this testimony as I'm finishing one young man came to me and we were walking in the evening his uh brother-in-law and and he was sharing with me he said I'm a minister even started preaching but I don't have the baptism of the Holocaust he said what can I do I don't know what to do Pastor just how can I receive the Holy Ghost now then I began to take him through it but I'm said he said I pulled out my phone and began to read the quote he said you must believe the Holy Ghost is for you Hallelujah and you must believe it and when the moment you believe it and by the Bible say the longest they waited the longest they waited was 10 days in the upper room 10 days Hallelujah by the others Hallelujah the moment you believe the moment you believe God can fill you with the Holy Ghost right there and there because he's more willing to give you the Holy Ghost than you are willing and this young man we had walked like two three kilometers and we were in a place where they are full of homes and walking in the pathway and right there in that moment you know something happened in his soul I can't explain it he began to explode and and speak in tongues and shout and holler and you know I was like oh people are not seeing us I was like I wasn't feeling what he was feeling but I knew right there God had visited him and God filled him with the Holy Ghost right there and then when the devil thought he had won and the boy was so confused and he was so sad and he thought he didn't maybe you were not going to Rapture let me tell you don't listen to what the devil tells you don't listen to what the devil tells you did you hear what I said before I leave benoni at least hear this don't listen to what the devil tells you whenever you come to church hear the word of God because the word of God is sure the word of God is faithful the word of God is at the fading the word of God can change you and it can do the impossibilities [Applause] when the devil thinks he has won in your life watch God begin to move oh I wonder if there is somebody here who can heal himself so much to God that God will move in their soul unless something happened that you somebody cannot explain away that man came back and he said look all I know all I know I was lame but now I was blind but now I can see I was lame but now I can walk I don't care about the Fanatics what they say what what you need right now is attached from him a touch of the master kind of singers come let us sing the song we are more than conquerors we've been made more than conquerors Overcomers in this life oh Hallelujah oh thank you sweet Holy Spirit oh Hallelujah why do you stand on your feet everybody now do you feel that nudge of the Holy Spirit that same God that was in the meetings of our prophet is with us in our generation too to prove to you that you are the generation of Overcomers you are going to overcome this the enemy has no power over you the enemy has no power because the victory has been won by our Great and Mighty conqueror Jesus Christ and he is here hallelujah it's not because I said it but I believe that whenever his word is spoken it takes vibrations in the hearts of the people and and Faith begins to build up and things began to to happen and even the impossibilities now become possible is the god Hallelujah that is ever present oh yes thank you Lord Jesus thank you Jesus oh Hallelujah we have been made

Branham says in that day there was more Philistines gathered in there than ever he had encountered in his life he killed more when the enemy thought he had won you know I was thinking about Samaria when it was besieged and how there were four lepers that were out there when the enemy thought he had won but God was joining four men and amplifying their presence uh right at that moment brother where a man had made a reckless prophecy a reckless declaration to say tomorrow by this time you shall have a measure of flower and Bali being sold for a shekel when things and odds were against the situation when it looked like it's not possible but God was waking out another possibility God was working out a plan and I want to tell you that God is working out a plan in your life when it looks

was one person that everybody thought would be number one and they've called the 49 and you also had counted that person to be the number one and there's only one name that is left to be called out people everyone's eyes will be on that one person that everyone suggests to be the winner and there the announcement goes and your name is the one that is called at that moment in soccer that's what they call a caved ball it's a ball that is not Direct kicked as if it's going this side but somewhere in the air it turns that's what happened with Goliath after boasting for 40 days asking for a man and God brought a boy and brother Branham says David didn't throw the stone on target he says he took the slingshot and threw the stone anyhow are you hearing that he threw the stone anyhow and he says in the Holy Ghost caught a hold of the Stone and redirected the stone [Music] Hallelujah if David had missed people would have died imagine if David had missed Goliath that rage that Goliath would have heard at the time but right there David was not on target and everyone was seeing that David is not on target the stone is going this way and David and Goliath is standing that way and the Holy Ghost got a hold of the Stone Hallelujah and the stone started moving towards collage and collab turned his head like this and the stone turns towards his head and could attend his head like this it was a programmed Stone this technology that you hear of the anti-ballistic missile that they can put coordinates to say this missile should hit this plane those missiles if the plane goes like this the missile follows it's programmed to the Target and the the stone was programmed to the Target it was not Stone number two it was Stone number one many times you know when somebody comes to me and say pray for me I pray for them and they come the second time I ask a question which prayer should we believe should we believe this one that I'm making right now or should we believe Stone number one I always believe Stone number one is powerful are you hearing what I'm saying she has been released to you this morning it looks like the devil is with the LIE of the devil the devil is when he fell down that was to me I was paralyzed when the preacher said he says when Satan fell you feel as a loser [Music] the title changed from Lucifer to loser are you hearing me that table is a loser man you you can't lose to a loser what what do you become are you here he has lost already he fell as a loser [Music] we we we are in a battle whose outcome has been determined hearing while we are fighting the battle my belt is written winner already Satan's boat is written loser you know where to put your money Jesus said give me the keys foreign give me the keys of hell give me the keys of death and brother Brahm says and he he he lifted his leg and give Satan a kick brother Brown says God gave Satan a kick in the spinal cord he says and he broke Satan's back [Music] okay wait wait this is another level now Satan was a loser but did you know he's also in a wheelchair he's got a broken back in other words he can't stand the spinal cord is the the discs are dislocated are you hearing me that's why Satan is a bluff what is a bluff a bluff is a dog without teeth but it can bark so he goes me [Music] bite me are you hearing me [Music] thank you we'll be seeing you about to run we're saying don't run don't land don't run that Devil is a bluff [Music] he was defeated already even if it looks like he's judging towards you just tends to stand still Moses wanted to run God says stand still and see the salvation of God Israel wanted to backslide because they stand still tends to speak and go forward you wanted to cry God says why Christ speak your destination has already been determined uh maybe you missed it when the preacher was saying the preacher is saying that story is over Jesus on the cross said it is finished are you hearing me it is finished and I'm here I'm coming to back it up I am saying it is finished the Bible says thus said the Lord it is finished your issue of papers is finished your issue of the job is finished your issue of children is finished your issue of the car is finished hey winner those that believe it shall partake of it Satan is down he can't rise again [Music] Hallelujah there is no more battle brother the petal is over the pride is overcome my brother my sister you have overcome a I am redeemed do you know that what that means it's over when the issue of redemption is being questioned I am redeemed is over I can't be judged because I am redeemed therefore there is no more condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus the issue is over who is your accuser this morning look him in the face I am not a sinner are you hearing me Satan says you have seen I looked down don't receive this message is not for you you are the one I'm talking to this morning Pastor you don't know what I was doing last night I don't need to know he knows your name I'm not the one who called you to this church I'm not the one that called you into this message Jacob have I loved is so have I hate it you can't do anything to kick yourself out of the Kingdom you can't kick yourself out of what you never put yourself in hell is not secure hell is not secure there is no keys to help you can only close the gate but you can't lock it but in heaven is secure and we have got the keys are you hearing me we've got that case to open heaven for you and let you in we have the keys we are the Peter of this day and we also have the keys of death we can look dead and say for no one is going to die can you say man Hallelujah whatsoever we're buying on Earth is bound in heaven [Applause] brother promises the church has the power to shut and to lose the heavens just like Elijah and we don't have to wait for three and a half years [Music] are you hearing me we don't have to wait for three and a half years we can chat and we can lose if with us and when we have lost its offer [Music] [Applause] we used to hunt beds with stones you shoot it a bit you watch your stone and you watch the bed sometimes you see your stone eating right on the bed and then and then after some time the bid Rises and goes if you were a wise Hunter you would follow that bet we used to call it kafiramberry we would say this dead this bed is flying but it's flying under shock but in the real terms it's actually dead that's what I want to tell you even if you see that this is flying just under shock but the stone that has hit it it's actually dead while it's lying foreign [Applause] God has removed the element that kills in your disease are you hearing that so so they can scan and they can still see the lump of cancer but that the life of the cancer has been removed it has been condemned Hallelujah you say this Prophet is going to die because the stone that is heated is serious this smoking weakness is going to die because the stone that has heated glory to God we have just had our Easter meetings God bless you God bless you God bless you my what can we say beautiful preaching wonderful things God works in very simple ways brother I usually say if the preacher says something about my situation to me it's over that's what I come to church for I am just waiting to hear something about me if it talks about my theophany if he talks about my situation at home if he talks about my prayer points to me it's over are you hearing me I have confidence more in God when that is done and the word is The Descent of the thoughts you see when we preach we are just short of saying thus save the Lord but it will be thus says the Lord because brother Brown says the bride yes God that says the Lord in him so the preaching of the word is that says the Lord you know I say a lot of people get excited when they are reading the spoken word and you hear a preacher saying you see here brother Branham even said that's if that says the Lord [Applause] Paul came and right he says it is not the Lord it is I and then at the end of the chapter he says but if any man think himself to be spiritual let him acknowledge that the very words that I speak are of the Lord just in case you get excited that says the Lord I would rather believe a positive thing being spoken over my life than to be told you never make it the devil thought he had won but Adam was there to say don't worry I'll redeem you and God was there to say don't worry I'll redeem here you cannot be lost because you're saved please check out greetings with to Kampala tell them we appreciate them thank them for releasing you if the Lord carries one day will come and see them in Kampala see the bride in in Uganda you know [Music] I'm always amazed at how God has got a witness everywhere you know you see a man you have never met and you can sit and you can talk yesterday we had to forced to cut our fellowship we could have gone on and on because you're just seeing a person who believes the same thing and everywhere I travel I always say you know with my natural relatives maybe we just talk about what's important about the family how is Uncle how is what happened to the plot and you know those things and after three hours the conversation is over and then you see you start talking about politics but when you meet it's so talking to Soul oh brother when the souls were opened you know and there was there was something that he was uh he was speaking about when we were fellowshipping and I said I didn't tell him then but I said this I think this needs to be preached when we're talking about the sacrifices that's been done for the message you know um he's been very privileged you know to to have a relationship with some of the greatest ministers in the message pastor biscal Pastor Villa ratif you know uh you know brother John and is dead the one that transcribed the message and you know those great men and the sacrifice that they did for the message and and I was thinking while we're fellowshipping the other men that I know that God has used for the sacrifice and we're talking about how young people now take this message casually you know and just feel like no you know we you know these days are different but the sacrifice you can't rub it and I was thinking of the song is dripping with blood this Holy Ghost Gospel and I thought but we're no longer talking about just the Bible now we're talking about the spoken word itself these men might not have died with blood coming out but they lost something they a piece of them died I believe you know maybe next time he comes we'll have you know some sessions where we have you like talk you know you know whichever the Lord lays upon your heart and it will be a blessing we appreciate God so much for such a wonderful time it's been long since since I sang this song let's say amen amen shows I'm happy let's end up on our feet [Music] um [Music] [Music] I miss you [Music] amen [Music] oh once I've been a
