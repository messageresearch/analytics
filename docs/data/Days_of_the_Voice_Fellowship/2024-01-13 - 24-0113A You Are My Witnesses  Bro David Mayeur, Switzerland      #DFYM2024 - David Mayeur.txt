just Changing Times praise the Lord if the devil thinks he will do something to upset us will instead ruin himself you know in the last year brother Mel brother Michel R was preaching everybody it's like the devil I think he must have regreted how many of you remember that you know everybody went into worship and even when I'm in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me we had we had a video day that day the came back just screamed it all the Lord had done everything us and so a lot of things to coordinate with the with the people here so whatever else is not going well our desire and prayer is that God will give us our permanent place for these youth meetings I've told some a few Brothers a few of our close friends and sometimes you know some people have told me no that's being over ambitious it's not about being ambitious you canot be over ambitious about the work of all the men of God that went before us and did great things that have made us who we are today you know they had to do things that were was greater than them so we believe God will give us our own Youth Center amen I don't care how long it takes anyways we charged up for the service now and I'd like to invite Brother David right away and take over but I I want to be to continue being expectant and believing for each service God will do something for you amen shall we do only believe and then we shall have Brother David come Amen brother have a microphone can only believe [Music] all things are possible all things are possible only believe [Music] only only [Music] all things are [Music] POS oh Lord I believe Lord [Music] I Lord [Music] I all [Music] things [Music] I [Music] Lord oh things are POS [Music] hallelujah amen Lord I [Music] believe God has greatly blessed us but I say this afternoon once more Lord I am hungry about the word word of God Amen because that's food that keeps me all through eternity Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word of God last forever amen amen amen God bless you richly those that wer in there last night bless you we love [Music] you and it's a great honor to be standing here amen and pray will be a blessing for you you know when Christ saved me and saved us there were a million of people groping in sin but when God saved us he had a purpose in doing so we heard it this morning you are precious in God's eyes he loved us before we were unlovable and even now he want to continue and bless us God saved us for a purpose and I am determined how many can say this afternoon I am that by his will I will do God's purpose amen amen let us go into the word let's go to Mark please excuse me I'll take my jacket off because it's not like in Switzerland where it's freezing but there's one thing we have in common atmosphere when the people of God gather the Saints start to praise we create the atmosphere welcome God and He does the supernatural amen so Mark 11 verse [Music] 22 and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he had said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said now Jesus talks to us therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them Jim now whose word do you want to believe this afternoon the [Music] president any so-called intellectual guy Professor Doctor Give Me Jesus his word can never fail amen act one verse four and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the per promise of the Father which said he ye have heard of [Music] me or John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to [Music] Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times nor the seasons which the father had put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth here in Uganda amen for a title this afternoon we heard what the word said and it speaks of the future you shall be I'm bringing it to present tense you are my Witnesses that's my title this afternoon the prophet says every God called witness must ued with power from on high before he can be a witness many people can talk they have an intellectual knowledge they can put quotes together by the intellect he we don't want intellectual sermons we want God to confirm his word because we serve a living God we want to be a personal witness to be endued from power from on high a witness has to know something see something know what he's talking about and it's not the intellect that can do it it's only experience change so you know what you're talking about know who I believe glory be to God let's have a word of prayer dear heavenly father once again we counted such a great honor father to be standing in your presence Lord God yes like the prophet said have chosen Millions Lord to think that you chose me chose us how thankful we are father I pray Lord God take full control over the service may take away every tiredness everything that is contrary to your word in Jesus Christ name we pray and the church says amen and amen you may amen we heard this morning that you are precious why don't you look to your neighbor and says I'm precious in God's eyes Hallelujah there goes away all complexes brother Timothy there goes away all [Music] complexes just think Saints ye are not here by chance but by God's choosing his hands formed us and he made us the person we are and he Compares us with nobody else we are one of a [Music] kind we lack nothing that his grace cannot give us and he by his grace has allowed us to be here in these meetings in this time of History to fulfill his purpose for this generation so let's just put things in focus [Music] if you were in the for knowledge of God and you are a part of God the only brother says the only way you can be a son or a daughter of [Music] God you had to be a part of God you want some good news God isn't complete Without You hallelujah amen I feel good I hope I'm not the only one without me therefore there are no big eyes and small years there is only and he is the one we worship amen the same power that spoke the world into existence is now in those people has the Holy Ghost it's time we found out who we are that's why God gave us a message message to tell us who we are where we come from where we going I don't come from Uganda I don't come from char andam come from God [Music] Amen Satan is trying to hide you back to tell you that you are a little Trot down [Music] something does he do that only to me you'll never make it you way too small you way too small it's not the size that matters of my I servant be God is he that is in me is against me and every sister you are not says the prophet you are not a little Trot down something you are Sons and Daughters of God D is not in heaven it's in you hallelujah amen have faith in God s believe him and he will bring it to pass amen oh he says what the Holy Spirit could do just at this moment this minute if we people could just let them go let them do [Music] it Lord Jesus have th own way I don't want to think about what's coming after my stomach may say I'm hungry my soul is saying give me more amen hallelujah amen why would we accept the substitute whatever Satan tries to give you why would he accept the substitute when disg are full of the real Holy Ghost down the fire lord fire fire fire like the day of as day don't be satisfied with what Satan tries to lure you me the real the real fire I'm not ashamed of the Gospel and if your experience is not the same as you as they had in the upper room new experience brother brandham says it this way I don't know if they play a lot of basketball hereas not really we bring it to soccer he says when people see a football game they cheer up they cheer but now he says if our Master is winning the fight can we can sure could do a little cutting up once in a while we can we can sure could do a little cutting up once a [Music] while you know let him know how we appreciate the victory what Victory the victory that he gave us that's right so we don't want it to be a dead meeting this afternoon that church we wanted to be alive we are not cheering our national team we are giving praise to our father to our god oh and as he has already won the victory Shout the victory victory is victory is mine I called Satan to get the behind hu amen that's the way we must think says the prophet he says we see somebody here being healed and others miss it saints of God don't miss it these are not just ordinary meetings receive your portion then for those who misses he said what what is it lack of faith because God doesn't treat his children one way and another way for somebody [Music] else God blesses the same way for the youngest to the oldest no matter where we come from we heard it this morning he love me he love you amen but we have to think his thoughts for the sake of time you can read it back home Romans 122 we have to be renewed and the prophet says when you begin to think his thoughts you will begin to live his life and do the things that he did you see what I mean not because it's it's not you it's Christ cast down reasoning these thoughts you can have in your mind that actually the word called strongholds come back to that in a moment strong walls going to keep you bound the prophet says amen the problem today people don't want to die to themselves simple leading of the Holy Ghost own you can think your thoughts his thoughts let the mind that was in Christ amen he thinks God's thoughts brings God's blessings and God's power to you oh now it says it can make a mess out of of you for who it can make a mess out of you as the world is concerned I don't want to be fashioned like the world no no no no fashion like the word of Amen old not as as far as the world is [Music] concerned but it will bring new life bring Resurrection Life bring thoughts it will bring a new person it bring you faith it bring you from death to life amen amen amen amen as long as you are in that way then God cannot do nothing for you what a statement you know what brother Bram says my biggest enemy is me don't put it on the word of God because the word is being spoken using vessels because he knows the needs of his people just Reed let it be so Lord according to Thy word amen amen amen when you think your thoughts then God's thoughts don't have a [Music] chance but if you quit thinking your thoughts he said my thoughts are not your thoughts if there be any praise if there be any virtue these things not what some church says about it what some personality says about God says about must again the word of God now the church is not only having Miracles the church is not only having miracles you know many people today even in the message well miracles happen you know after the upper [Music] room through different ages and then brother Brenham comes you know Miracles don't really happen anymore you come too late to tell me that turns Miracles he's doing them right now here amen amen amen amen amen and we're getting ready we're getting ready for we preparing for a miracle what is the miracle he says give me a church ready ready visualized the omnipotent God the great power of God moving amongst his people the Rapture will be an easing thing the Rapture will be an easing thing you know why because we are believers what do we do we believe every opposition so many laws of gravitation gra when I I come back if you don't believe me because that's laws that are put here but now there is another law that is the word of God that tells me I'm preparing for a body change miracle I fly away I Fly Away hallelujah amen nothing can hold me back a type of the Bride he was tired sick and tired of the world and he just went for an afternoon walk couldn't be in Uganda walk he had enough of this world believe me Saints I have enough of this world but Enoch the prophet says Enoch just went for an afternoon walk every step he took took him higher higher higher higher higher higher high yes I'm flying higher I'm putting Satan lower lower amen glory glory glory amen hallelujah amen Faith brings things when there are no things Faith creates takes doubt away takes doubt away the negative and puts it positive faith is not a mythical [Music] something something work up worked up something worked up or manufactured it's an absolutely fundamental result that happens in a person's heart Satan chose the Battleground here battle going on now God chose so it's not by intellect you believe all things are possible all things are possible to have a foundation the foundation on Christ the solid all the ground is sinking s hallelujah amen we are now in the power of the Resurrection says the prophet I'm I'm just putting a foundation here to bring us Higher and Higher and high so we are now in the power of the Resurrection that's the power isn't in the church now he says but there's a law to that that is fa Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe so whatever God will lead your soul to believe not what you think about it not what you feel about it what your soul believes that is yours and every place The Souls of your foot can set upon by faith it to hallelujah amen Footprints means possession now listen amen faith is the act that God has [Music] did in you to make you a Son of God so it's God doing if you want to try by yourself you're never going to make it you're never going to make it you know God ordained us before the foundation of the world you know he chose his elect the Propet example he says you don't need to tell to a sheep to produce wool born again son and daughter of God ask them to live according by the word when you have a true lifechanging experience you don't it's not you must or you don't let thy will be done Lord amen and I'm saying that I was born in the message you may say Brother David lucky you you know what you can be raised in the message without the true Born Again experience yes yes I was born in the message but I had to have my personal experience out at the where you say Lord I need you amen and now is our time Saints amen that's why we have these meetings amen so let's release our faith let's release our faith because the prophet says as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have sat may tell you your little little little little little something David I've seen it work in saw goath he knew he experienced the power of the almighty God he was a witness Goliath glory glory amen Saints I'm putting in a present tense we Are [Music] Witnesses let's take an example in the Bible that one off so we forget about time we're creatures of [Music] Eternity hey the Bible tells us when Jesus was speaking when the apostles were speaking you know where the power of God is you lose time when they came out of Egypt amen the power of God was there with them their clothes didn't wear out and God provided for their [Music] food so if you're hungry go to the angel take the little book need the little book so you can the little book and you'll never thirst again you'll never h [Applause] again amen let's take Joshua an example Joshua meaning savior he says see brother PR says in Victory Day he had the enemy all [Music] rooted everywhere but he had to hunt them down to kill them that's all there was to it because that was his commission so the enemy was everywhere but Joshua was commissioned just like you heard yesterday we are commissioned and the prophet says you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you better get rid of your bad habits by surrendering to God in meetings like this where I surrender all amen Joshua says amen he said he knew if it was going to be night time they would have time to mobilize again to get organized again don't leave any chance to Satan organized brother Bram was in a meeting amen and he was saying because people were here Bound by demons this demon was crying to another person there was possess that in the presence of God nothing can stand your faith before prayer don't get let them get organized so Joshua said I need [Music] light what do you need Miss Jesus [Music] Christ Hallelujah am I need light son stand still and God listened to a man's word stopped the Sun what a paradox what a paradox God did it anyhow how by a man not a great angel coming down from heaven but a man with faith in the mission that he was given to take and possess the land and the word of God was behind it I give you this land I give you the open book that's the land of promise amen amen am the sun Stood Still the moon over aelon because a man a human being was in line of duty he commanded the son to stand still and if we are Christians okay let me bring it to your front door now how many confess to be real true Born Again Christians so if we are real Christians we have to believe the word of God the infallible word of God he stopped the world he stopped the son brother BR says ever he did the son stood still for 24 [Music] hours and Mark 11:22 says we read it if you say to this mountain said it will come to pass amen Joshua stopped the sun Joshua IM does that make a Superman out of him I'm asking you the question you know people like to raise up people brother Bram created squirrels does make a Superman out of it no sir because God chose vessels amen amen his work for brother of Malachi 4 is done here here but we have to continue the commission we have to utterly destroy Satan's kingdom by God's word fa in God's word me all things are possible With God all things are possible to you also nothing impossible to them that listen to what the prophet says I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their Authority I'm afraid that the Holy Ghost born man don't realize their Authority The Authority that God has permitted in his church that's why God came down to break the seals so we know our position in Christ Jesus so exercise your faith God have his way Joshua was promised the whole land my but here comes some big walls in front of him some big chains some big [Music] fortresses but we need to destroy them look at joshuaa before one rock ever came out of the building of the walls of Jero what was Joshua's [Music] attitude good I have your [Music] attention you know Joshua and Caleb when they heard you know the spies were sent out they were the only ones that didn't have a pity party they didn't have the attitude of defeat well they saw the Giants they saw the same thing as the others did but they said we are more than able because God has already spoken the word Joshua said how how can I destroy these walls you gave me the land but there's got to be a way that the land becomes mine I'm bringing up to us now there has to be a way that the seals come open the seals don't come open see our full possession our true [Music] identity while Joshua seeks the the Lord in prayer the Lord comes down he sees a man and he draws the sword are you for me or against me that's a real Soldier are you with me or against me the battlefield I'm going to destroy every demon but here he says I am the captain here I am in charge here I am going to lead you so we don't need another leader we don't need an eight person Holy Ghost will lead you in all truth the Holy Ghost will lead you amen even brother Bram needed the angel of the Lord to come down and to reveal the seals he says I would have made a horrible mistake no one is worthy to take the book only the lamb is Worthy Revelation is not brother branham's intellectual property property so many men try to point to themselves I have to follow up what brother Bram said no no no the only one we can point toist amen the original word God's Property and he Reveals His Own word God chose His Bride and he is in charge no manade system will ever make it so now we see Joshua seven Church ages walks around the walls in silence now in the seven Church age yes in L yes I am in the bright age but according in the lapse of time because when the bride is raptured it's over with amen so seven Church ages but now in the days of the voice he shall begin to sound the mystery shall be revealed and these walls seals they will be revealed these Thunders will UT their voices will have a jubilee for some it is silence for some it is silence but for the bride because it's back toig the shout of the king is in [Music] this hallelujah amen so Joshua how many joshuas do we have this afternoon I'm taking the quote now before one rock the walls ofer Joshua walked around the walls shouting the victory seven times there was silence G they had to walk seven times the seven seal was open of victory in the amen why could Joshua be like that why could he be like that he was looking at the UNC it was a promise that God made but now he brings it to us how much can you walk around your wheelchair if you go by your reasoning I'm in a wheelchair how can I so maybe you're not in a wheelchair maybe you're not in a wheel you are may be bound for many years you are May Bound for many years start walking proclaiming the victory he says how much you can walk around the cancer how much you can walk around your sin Victory God gave you the promise amen when you can see him who is the invisible when that pulsation comes into your heart I am the Lord God that he your time Saints to utterly destroy if even Satan tries to pop up his head a [Music] little amen hallelujah hallelujah amen you know when God gives a commission he will finish it [Music] perfectly so when he commissioned us he said I'll be with you even in you until the end of the Earth we are not alone in this battle Mighty in [Applause] battle Joshua got the commission to UT destroy you know the word of God is perfect anybody who doubts God is we know the story of [Music] RAB she wasn't necessarily A Lady of a good reput just like me just like us we are all sinners but how God does things amen because out of a certain lineage what lineage let's look at it Boaz Boaz he comes from the Lich of salonon Solomon Salon was married to [Music] RAB Ruth 4 verse 21 sayson andot and Jessie and Jessie David Matthew verse says andon boas of Rabon Ruth Jessie Jess and Jacob got Joseph husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus called the Christ amen amen now Joshua jhua he gave a clear instruction Raab when she saw the two when she saw the spies she accepted the word come on Saints she didn't look on her past worthy to receive you in my home come I'll you okay so now Raab knowing what it represents starts confessing [Music] saying do you know what she she starts being a witness hehua do youy Joshua josua do you know the whole arm God let me tell you you know that right now oh hell is trembling because the Lord God tells me the Lord God tells me when the weakest of the Saints oh hell [Applause] [Music] soab starts testifying being a witness jul but Joshua Joshua I have some requests savior I have some requests Joshua says if you apply the token th and thy household whoever you bring under the blood claim you have them you have them apply the token God Will Make A Way amen glory be to God Amen so Joshua gave clear instructions and we can read that in Joshua 6 and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old if you go by your reasoning you'll say come on joshuaa you mean this little baby [Music] little any kind of sight all these sites that you go on in your secret room you better destroy your enemy before the enemy destroys you don't start reasoning with the word destroy every young sheep with the of the sword God's word is perfect now I just told you Jesus came from the lineage of Rahab amen she applied the token Joshua commanded to utterly destroy do you know why that [Music] was because I can see down the road now a few years later I can see the high priest standing before RAB [Music] andon who are going to marry her past was terrible but she applied the token the blood of Jesus makes the viol sinner clean so here she stands andon and the high priest says they are going to get married into this holy state these two persons are coming here to be joined together so as any Pastor just like the prophet Tau us we quote the word the high priest stands there he says if there is any person here that can show a Just Cause why they should not lawfully be joined together in this holy matrimony may he now speak or from heref forever hold your [Applause] peace nobody could say whatsoever glory be to God Joshua made sure there was no witness left no Ox no goat nobody could say whatsoever amen amen hallelujah me he Sanctified me I've already glorified me I have never done it in the first place hallelujah amen hallelujah amen trying to wind up here the Lord made sure that all accusation are amen erased erased deleted [Music] erased amen when Jesus was walking here well we found this woman starts writing he hear Stones Fall according to the law we should Stone a person when Grace comes on the scene where are thy accusers now thank you Jesus he L me he loved me he forgave my [Applause] sin and it's in the sea of forgetfulness to be reminded again amen I can hear Jesus say that's where he erased where he provided at Calvary Calvary then he went down to Hell listen he says I am the Virgin born son of [Music] God I came from the ivory palaces of my father and I came to Earth and on the earth is bathed this morning my blood that I gave I paid the price of death Satan give me these Keys hallelujah amen stupid devil stupid Satan realiz this afternoon even has his keys to his own kingdom Satan has keys glory glory glory [Applause] amen My Savior says these words I am taking over from here on am you've kept the people in bondage you've kept them in fear but I'll take over Hall
