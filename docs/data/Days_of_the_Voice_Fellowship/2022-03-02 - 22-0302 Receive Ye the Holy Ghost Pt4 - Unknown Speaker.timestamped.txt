[20:48] [Music]
[21:28] we desire
[21:42] him
[21:46] if you are not filled with the holy
[21:47] spirit
[21:49] whenever you are coming to the service
[21:50] well you know service believe that that

[21:56] holy
[22:05] [Music]
[22:21] we shall realize that all the church
[22:23] services we have to go to
[22:54] [Music]
[22:59] you know many people when they come to
[23:01] the message they think that it's all
[23:02] about understanding the mysteries of the
[23:04] message
[23:21] many corridors should be able to take us
[23:23] to the promised land be taken to someone
[23:26] since you because if the mysteries
[23:27] cannot take us to the promised land
[23:31] of the holy ghost
[23:33] of the restoration you could dissipate
[23:35] with the redemption
[23:38] then we don't need the reviewed business
[23:40] area maybe even creator but also we
[23:42] cannot be able to go to the promised
[23:44] land
[23:46] we cannot attain the redemption of our
[23:48] souls
[23:51] [Music]
[23:59] without having restored back to the
[24:01] revealed truth
[24:17] stereo if you can be able to control
[24:19] that and give me a little more bass and
[24:21] decrease the stereo amen
[24:23] when jesus christ came yes
[24:26] he
[24:27] after resurrection

[24:43] he had already taught them for a space
[24:44] of three
[25:22] [Music]
[26:03] [Music]
[26:36] refused to follow him
[26:38] to the death of five questions you see
[26:41] when that time comes
[26:44] when your faith stands
[26:49] when you you are supposed to leave you
[26:52] take it
[26:55] to to to walk the talk
[27:00] to live according to your confession
[27:16] that is when we shall not believe us an
[27:18] unbeliever
[27:25] [Music]
[27:33] when the time and the moment comes like
[27:35] i said i know
[27:36] when you have to manifest the light or
[27:39] you know call this over them
[27:41] that you claim to have with organ and
[27:44] jewelry is when you can be able to know
[27:46] whether you have the holy ghost or you

[48:37] and today
[48:39] we have both those things and interviews
[48:43] we have the end of death
[48:48] and we have the blood to ruin a normal
[48:50] messiah jesus died on the bride under
[48:53] the cross yes yes
[48:55] two thousand years ago
[48:57] jesus
[49:08] there is no church
[49:09] passing
[49:10] milliliters and liters of the blood of
[49:13] jesus christ
[49:29] that blood of jesus christ oh messiah
[49:34] the bible in the book of first john
[49:35] bible
[49:37] what does he say again he says
[49:40] he calls it
[49:41] let me
[49:42] since we are doing a little teaching
[49:43] here let me go let me let's read that
[49:45] party
[49:49] hallelujah
[50:06] let us first read the
[50:09] first read second corinthians chapter 5
[50:10] verse 19.
[50:17] [Music]
[50:20] god was in christ reconciling the world
[50:22] unto himself not imputing their
[50:23] trespasses unto them and has committed
[50:25] them to ask the word of reconciliation
[50:32] first second
[50:33] five corinthians five verse nine
[50:35] verse nine biblio
[50:52] yes
[50:53] 5 17 begin from 17.
[50:56] therefore if any man be in christ she is
[50:58] a new creature all things are passed
[51:01] away behold all things have become new
[51:03] omotri and
[51:05] crystal
[51:06] register
[51:11] and all things are out of god who has
[51:14] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[51:18] and has given to us the ministry of
[51:21] reconciliation
[51:33] whereas
[51:44] [Music]
[52:03] now
[52:04] there's quite many scriptures we can
[52:06] read but i think uh
[52:08] i i will uh
[52:12] all right we can we could read john 5
[52:14] but for stream 5 but i think we can skip
[52:16] that for now
[52:18] it says
[52:19] [Music]
[52:22] okay you why don't you read first john 1
[52:25] 7
[52:30] or in your
[52:47] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[52:50] cleanses us from all sin
[52:54] away
[52:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[52:58] then he says
[53:00] [Music]
[53:01] in revelation 1 5 and from jesus christ
[53:04] who is the faithful witness and the
[53:06] first begotten
[53:08] um
[53:09] and the first begotten of the dead and
[53:12] the prince of the kings of the earth and
[53:14] to him that loved us and washed us from
[53:16] our sins in his own blood
[53:26] foreign
[53:35] and that is why
[53:39] when we are in christ
[53:48] that is why all the things pass away
[53:53] that is why all things become new
[53:57] why
[53:57] because we are under the ministry of
[54:00] reconciliation
[54:04] reconciliation
[54:06] to reconcile
[54:09] means to bring back to uh to bring
[54:12] together two parties
[54:16] i could call it a restoration or
[54:18] restoration of friendly relationships
[54:33] [Applause]
[54:44] amen what desire to bring us back
[54:47] together with him
[54:50] because he
[55:19] of reconciliation
[55:20] [Music]
[55:22] so what was jesus's ministry where is
[55:24] that
[55:25] his ministry what is that what was the
[55:27] ministry of reconciliation
[55:31] on the ground
[56:01] on verse 19 he brings it on down to
[56:03] asanas
[56:06] and he says
[56:08] do we
[56:10] that god was in christ
[56:29] himself
[56:31] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[56:36] he has not and he cannot and he will not
[56:38] impute my trespasses tonight
[57:23] amen when jesus came on the earth
