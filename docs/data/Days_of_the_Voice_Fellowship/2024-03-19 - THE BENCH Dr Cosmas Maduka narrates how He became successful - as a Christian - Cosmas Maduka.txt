TRANSCRIPT
========================================
can give you a little time to you know narrate and not only narrate but also tell our young people how you arrived here because the reason why I ask this question is we have a lot of get rich quick schemes sure and brother bam talked about that and many young people think that they can arrive at wealth in just a blink of an eye you know invest you know one you know one naira or one Shillings and get 500 million in in an overnight yeah so how how was this possible for you okay you know um my story sometime I thought it could have been balling to a lot of people because I have just simple one story that I've repeatedly you know tell around the world um but as an individual I believe our story is somewhat unique unique in the sense that um um um I am a manifestation of the grace of God as an individual uh because um um when you people sing that hym from grass to riches he took a beggar and make him a king I've never listened to that song without breaking down tears coming from my eyes because that song Tell My Story absolutely my story um I live to in my generation I just think God raised me up to show people that there is no mountain that is insurmountable there's no hell that is too high to Crime William Braham the prophet of this age let us know that it is our attitude yes that brings the result mhm um and he said that from experience he didn't just said that off his head m b was gifted he was a messenger and a prophet for a generation but he never Clos his leg and sit back and said because I am a messenger I am called for this uh uh generation God will just download all informations from my head but you could still see him really committed to his call yes what I try to tell young people is to pursue purpose and life yes if you pursue purpose every other 10 will add to it and what is purpose purpose is the reason why purose is why you exist exist M purpose is why things is made and the things that are made 90% Almost 100% of the time don't know its purpose the purpose is only in the mind of the maker the manufacturer if you ask this bottle of water why were you made he will not answer you he didn't know yeah but if you ask the person who made it it will tell you this is made for refreshment you can drink it is water if you ask this chair this where were you made he did not know mhm so if you want to know you ask the maker mhm so who is the maker of human being God God so if you don't understand your purpose of existence that's the reason why you need to go to God exactly because the manufacturer build success m in everything that is made but a lot of people try to approach Life by presuming M if you do not understand purpose abuse will be inevitable if I don't know that this was made as a table to hold laptop to hold water I can decide to stand on it I may think it's a uh um I I think that uh it's a standing uh I can sit on it if I'm sitting on this or standing on it I'm abusing it exactly and why am I abusing it because I did not know the purpose for which it is made yeah so if it doesn't serve his purpose then abuse will become inevitable many people abused their life because they did not know the purpose of their existence m now let me back up I was born to one loin that's my mother's name and my father's name is Peter Muk uh 65 years ago um within the 4 years of my existence onto the Earth my father went to be with the Lord I was a young man who do not know my left to right put your eyes in the mind of a four years a baby M um the generation I grew up with those days you have to fake sickness to be able to eat rice rice used to be a delicacy a special food and uh only you can only get it if not for a festival you need to really be sick and refuse to eat other food then they ask you can't we find you something to eat what will you eat then you say rice but there was this particular day that everybody was kind to me I ate rice more than five times or eight times anybody pass what you eat rice and I was saying oh my God what a wonderful day this kind of day should never end and uh I I you know some people are come trooping into our house it was like a festival you know and um masr were coming people were beating music and things but I saw my mother unlike the rest of everybody feeling happy on the one corner of the wall her hair scattered she was crying and I was asking what's making her angry everybody is Happy why is she uh unhappy L little did I know that that was the funeral of my father but I saw my father in a black suit with a white shade on a bow tie lying on a bed so I thought he was taking a nap h I didn't know what it is but letterer in my life that's the best I can say I knew my father so life was rough uh gave me no opportunity to survive or become anything in life um it was really really difficult but I still respect a lot of Godly women uh William Braham the prophet of this age told us that a Godly mother is the first pastor of the house yes and that the New Testament has four book and the mother is the Fifth Gospel um I can truly say I experienced that with my mother my mother was not a Pentecostal or a message person but was a devoted Catholic and really you know she was committed to her belief MH and um if you ask me to say I would say created the hunger of God in Me because she wakes us up when I was in that age early morning by 5:00 for morning devotion and we had to pray Catholic rosing you know in Our Father who is in heaven you know after that we say hell Mar full of grace 10 times repeatedly and that was where initially it was difficult but like everything in life practice makes perfect yes and the more you do things the more you get accustomed to it and you love it I saw my mother pray all night really Desiring for God because life was unfair to her she was at tender age her husband went to be with the Lord and he has four kids to take care of so she doesn't have anybody but God and introduce try to introduce this God to us when I was too young so many time we wake up and we are feeling sleepy sometime he will use her five pums on our botom to wake us up or any of us feeling sleepy if you that sleep never left you she has a cup of water she emptied it in your head that was the worst that I almost hate God for that one I just said what kind of God is this that this cold water come on your head in the morning then sleep will disappear but that was how she knew that's the best she knew she has good intention so from then when I started growing up I wasn't waiting for my mother again to lead me for prayer I started praying on my own you know started having hunger and desire for god um we were Catholics that's our background um I became an alter boy yes I was an alter boy you know I was a mass servant you know try everything I can but again if the way to live a life is to be honest yes if there's anything even till today when I talk to Believers I said if there's one thing God want us to bring on the table yes it's our honest of purpose forget your mistake forget about anything because you are human being but will you be honest to own up not looking for anybody to to hold you in your Adam's ample to get you to accept when you are wrong exactly God required that depth of sincerity and if there's anything that set William Braham has apart from his contemporary was that level of depth of sincerity and approach to God yeah because he knew you can't fool God you can fool a man but you can't fool God so if you can approach god with that attitude of depth of sincerity the sky is your limit yeah in fact you won't have limit because what William BL told us that a man or a woman that completely surrender his heart to God is an omin poent when God can get you to a point you have no reservation you truly want to empty out and let him come in then he can use you because the the number one enemy you have is not your husband is not your wife it's not your uncle it's not your children it's not your father it's yourself exactly so if you can get yourself out of the way MH then God will have his way in your life yeah so while you continue sorry to interrupt you you spoke of of your mother so it all whenever I hear you tell this story it really reminds me of my mother and you know most of the people that are listening to us are young people as I told you of this and we see that uh the younger generation the women no longer want to uh be women and no longer want to be wives and take care of children and train them and raise them in the fear of God but if a a Catholic mother can be able to do that and instill the fear of God in you how much more a believing woman can do well I think a believing woman should do much better uh in every sense because we were once like half spiritual Amia but when we came in into this message this end time message God sent William Braham to reveal the heart of God to us yeah so we we are like having an open book we are not gazing Stars anymore we are not supposed to be speculating we are not know this we should know better nobody I've never heard it from anybody that mother is the first pastor of the house I never heard it from anybody that that the gospel had Fifth Gospel and mother should occupy that place so B had used different words to show us how important a mother is exactly because most of the problem we have today Frankly Speaking is not child delinquent many parent are Del it's parent delinquency that we are going through there is no authority figure in the house anymore people are not properly guided how they should believe and the love the the parents need to show to their children to be able to you know take them on but let me say that many people can use this as excuse to their life why they are not important but if you think that is excuse I can also have good excuse because part of the excuse is that I didn't have father care Over Me growing up so at the end of the day we are individually responsible for the choices we made many time we don't like it because we like to abrigate responsibility looking for who to blame why we are not who we are supposed to be MH but heart statement the truth is that every one of us is a su total of church choices we have made in life that's right okay many time we don't acknowledge or appreciate it one wrong choice doesn't make you a failure m one right choice doesn't make you successful it's a it's a constant Su total MH of wrong choices you made over a period of time yeah you you become a failure it's a su total of right choices you made over a period of time that make you successful yeah because nobody will say he had never made a mistake so the choices we make really matter they the choices we made in life make at the end of the day we are some total of the choices we made and but a lot of people wonder how can I be successful yeah I believe this is my personal belief that success is predictable yeah okay and failure is also predictable okay because everything a manufacturer build he build success into it mhm so there is a law our success as human beings is good for God God want us to succeed every one of us God never build any of us to be a failure that's right but whether we succeed or fail m is up to us mhm I've had I've discussed with some young people and quite a number of times some of them told me where is the place of Grace in this I'm saying that I am too hard on them where is the place of Grace I said please listen carefully so that you can understand and appreciate it and they listening and they listening I said Grace is an enablement but Grace is not disgrace okay if you read the scripture God told Joshua in Joshua Chapter 1:7 this book of law shall not depart from your mouth you shall meditate in it not only in the night not only in the day day and night then he say for then shall thou be successful there are conditions that is tied to it you don't just only meditate on the book but you said that you should observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou then shall thou make thyself not your uncle not your brother not your sister not then shall thou make thyself prosperous so I then explained to some young people I said look many of you don't understand Destiny mhm I go to different church and I hear them sing a song Destiny changer come and change my destiny destiny today come and change my destiny destiny today I said when they get to that Destiny changer I keep quiet they asked me why did I keep quiet I said I don't want my destiny change I love my destiny why am I you need your own change pray for it to change I don't want my own change I said let me tell you my understanding a little way for you to appreciate Destiny Okay I said if you are born in a rich man family yeah and you want to be a doctor MH if that's your desire MH and your father can pay your school fees to be a doctor you are destining to be a doctor doctor but whether in real life you become a doctor or not is up to you mhm they say how I said because if you want to be a doctor this is a a a discussion you need to have by yourself you can't be a doctor because you say I want to I want to MH you need to have self conversation mhm I want to be a doctor you ask you you you you have discussion with yourself how MH nobody become a doctor by mouth I want to that's right I want to doesn't make you a doctor M so when you make that discussion self conversation I want to be a doctor you ask yourself how you answer the question it's a conversation you're having with yourself to be a doctor I need to be good in five science subject M you are beginning okay I need to be good in math MH extra math English biology chemistry beautiful you are not good at it but you have identified them you are making progress exactly the next thing is that can I get a doctor can I get a teacher who will teach me marks who would teach me English mhm and you find out that these subjects are sometime things that frightens you but there's no fear in it if you get a good coach he will Coach you and before you know it you start exploiting this subject they become very easy for you mhm 6 years or eight from that day you become a doctor mhm if you are willing to learn and your father has the money to pay for your school exactly but if your father pay for your school and you you went go to school and become a rate run around with boys or girls m in 6 years you will not graduate exactly and if your father go and bribe the teacher to gradate you for you to begin to kill human being as a doctor is the worst thing he could do to you and to do to his other fellow human being so if you don't agraduate you need to rewrite that CL again and there time it will reach they will expire you from that school if because if you you you don't have ability to to to retain what you are learning to put it into practice M so so the choices you make really matter really matter they make you they make you so I told the man I said look there are two smart young people who thought they were very clev and they know everything and in their Village there was an elderly man who is very intelligent highly respected because he can decode anything for you and these two smart smart young man decided we're going to make full out of this man we're going to he think he's smart we will show him so they went and got a small B and hid it behind them and get to the Ancient Man and said there is a mystery we want you to decode to us mhm the man said go ahead he said we had a small bed in our back and we want you to tell us whether this bed is alive or dead dead they've already decided if the man said the bed is alive they will squeeze the bed and die die then they will show him a dead bed the man said the bed is H dead is a dead they will show him the bed that is alive so they met the Ancient Man and said can you please explain I told him I said this is what Destiny is up about can you explain whether this bird is life or dead the ancient man said it's not a problem whether this bird is alive or dead is up to you uhhuh that was the question in other words if you like kill the bed or you like keep it alive the question he gave them he said you want to know whether this bed is alive or dead my answer is that it's up to you it's your choice it's your choice you decide whether you want to keep him alive or kill him so this is what Destiny is all about M God had made a provision for every one of us because when he write his vision statement pering human being in Genesis 1:26 he was not under any illusion he said let me make a man mhm in my own likeness after my own kind the way he was is what he wanted to make man mhm so God created a man from beginning to be a Creator MH that's why he didn't even put on wear for the man when he created him he didn't give him a table he didn't give him a sheer he didn't give him a cow why because God wanted man to create it to be part of his creation M he take this table and hit it on the tree H it took this year kept it on the tree he took automobile keep it on the the team o and the in the mountain the only thing God gave his children which is still what we are fighting for God never gave a man car he didn't give him a shoe MH he HD it on the cow but he gave him sense to be able to get the things out of what is created to be able to recreate the only thing God gave man is land mhm is That's Why They Call property real estate it's the only estate that is real yeah that's why that's why they are still fighting in paristan today Overland over every problem of the world is land property that is the only thing God gave to his children yeah and I told some of the young believers who once they get the first money the first thing he bought a car the next one is's looking for I said car is not wealth Bible say a righteous man liveth wealth for his children children children if you can't put money in a property and die your child cannot herit your car if you don't have land you have not left any you because if you want to be a righteous man you follow God's principle m a righteous man liveth wealth for his children so the only estate that is really is property so when you start making money invest in property mhm so that you can live inheritance for your children don't just buy car buy nice suit and these are not inheritance for anybody so God didn't give a man a cloth but he left the cloth on the wool it's a man's responsibility to think outside of the bus to activate his blame to take the wool and be able to make a a clo but the land you cannot make God gave that to you but every other thing it is given in your own power to be able to make so let me continue with my story when I grew up as a young man I have an inquisitive mind m i i because so were you at a place when you are an alter boy and yes an alter boy you know God gave us 5 billion cells in our brain average human being use 10% of it if you get to 12% of it you will become a genius there are every that's why William Braham said everything we require to the resurrection is already in US is not coming it's already there that's right we only need people who can teach us Faith to activate those things and be able to get to our advancement MH because my mother taught me how to pray MH I heard that Mary visited three children at Fatima they told us this story in Catholic M I went to the bush to pray at the age of seven and I was talking to Mary I said I L you going to Fatima you can come to n you can come to my Village I want to see you you know told us about that little child that when the Thunder were um blasing the child was crying and the mother came to the child and said don't worry you know God is with you he said Mom I want god with flesh Soh I want god with flesh I need I needed I didn't want historical God I wanted to feel God I went to the bush I pray I didn't see Mary but that didn't stop that hunger of God in Me yeah because if there's a deep calling in your heart there is a deep somewhere to respond for it there's nothing you are taxing for that God has not provided but the things start from Hunger mhm you can never feed a man or a woman who is not hungry and you can never teach anybody to be hungry hunger is something that comes naturally naturally so if you don't if somebody is not hungry you are giving him food you are wasting time he had to show that he's hungry and that's how it is so that's why I'm saying everything about us it's about choices M as I I think um in a message I think is as I was with Moses B said that 10 years from today you can be an asset to the society but 10 years today you may be cening bathroom because of the choices you make today so our choices matters at the end of the day we are some total M life never gave me opportunity but I choose that I will be different M I choose I will not be like the rest of the other boys I choose I will not go the popular way every other person is going it was my choice MH we were my mother had us we are three boys and a girl the girl is my senior brother senior me and they had a girl we had had a we first three boys and then a girl MH but I was different from all of them not because I have better sense of them but I this my inquisitiveness of trying to know was what led me to my Christian faith because I have this desire my mother had had taught me that there is God and when I was 4 years old she looked me into the eyes and told me to believe in myself MH and to believe in God MH and that I will go places in life and that it would be difficult for people to say no to me MH at that innocent mind I believe everything my mother told me MH and I I I practice it in my life that's why in Genesis the first thing God did to his son is that he blessed them MH and then after he blessed them he gave them five strategic means to be able to be like him mhm dominate subdue control you know so rule this Earth for him when you apply those principle there's nothing that could stop you because so there is a a a a a law of success built on on every product mhm once you obey that success you will get the result take for instance I'm speaking with Dynamic phone mic okay this mic that I'm speaking has a battery inside yeah so this microphone do not want battery it needs battery to be able to function to be able to function so so battery is not a want but if you remove battery from this microphone and you decide to speak in tongue so that you can start speaking you can fast for 40 days days nothing will happen it will not work so you need to obey the law of the manufacturer first of all and the law of manufacturer is to give it battery yeah if you give it battery it will function yeah if you take put battery on it if you like to pray pray that's if you don't like to pray that's up to you but don't do any other thing without giving it battery because battery is a that makes it function so the need for battery is built on it by the manufacturer
