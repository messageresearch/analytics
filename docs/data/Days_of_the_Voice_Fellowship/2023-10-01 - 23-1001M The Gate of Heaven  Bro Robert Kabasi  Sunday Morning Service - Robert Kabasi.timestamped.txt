[1:06:48] moment but before we do that quickly I
[1:06:51] just want to get something out of the
[1:06:53] way
[1:06:56] you know uh this is a young
[1:07:00] fellowship and you know like I always
[1:07:02] tell
[1:07:03] you we are not a
[1:07:05] church we are just part of the
[1:07:09] church or maybe let me put it this way
[1:07:12] we are a church but we are not the
[1:07:22] church
[1:07:25] okay yes you know you know we are just a
[1:07:29] members of a church of the
[1:07:32] church this is a
[1:07:34] fellowship and we have the Church of
[1:07:36] Jesus is all over the
[1:07:39] world even here in CA there are many
[1:07:44] members of that church so we just a
[1:07:47] little
[1:07:48] Fellowship part of the Church of Jesus
[1:07:52] Christ church is the one built upon the
[1:07:55] rock of
[1:07:57] Revelation and he say the Gates of Hell
[1:08:00] shall not Prevail
[1:08:02] against and so we believe we are part of
[1:08:04] that triumphant
[1:08:07] church but this little
[1:08:10] Fellowship has uh been in existence for
[1:08:13] I I did not go back to check but I
[1:08:15] believe for uh perhaps two years and a
[1:08:18] few
[1:08:21] months someone who knows the dees you
[1:08:23] can throw it
[1:08:27] started a little bit in my home

[1:29:35] family you know we just shortly uh back
[1:29:38] fromis
[1:29:40] Ababa and we just back
[1:29:43] Uganda living
[1:29:45] inana but then the Lord led us to move
[1:29:50] here so I of course spoke to a few
[1:29:53] friends that we had in
[1:29:56] Cala
[1:29:58] pastors and uh they all encouraged
[1:30:01] us to do whatever the Lord had laid on
[1:30:04] our
[1:30:05] heart you know if you are
[1:30:09] young and in
[1:30:12] anything you need to seek counsel from
[1:30:15] those that have gone before
[1:30:19] you even if you thought that the Lord
[1:30:21] had led you
[1:30:24] and so uh Pastor Robert is one of
[1:30:28] those that uh encouraged us to
[1:30:33] continue you know he told me have you
[1:30:35] started the church
[1:30:36] yet I said no we in the
[1:30:39] house we are we are he said no you
[1:30:43] start once you start the Lord will give
[1:30:46] you Grace and we are behind you there
[1:30:50] many who said that
[1:30:52] but Pastor Robert has really meant it
[1:30:54] all these
[1:30:57] years amen and he has been standing with
[1:31:01] us recently we had our youth meetings
[1:31:04] here how many enjoyed the song reading
[1:31:07] of brother
[1:31:10] en this is the pastor
[1:31:13] brother and so uh most of these young
[1:31:16] people were
[1:31:18] here and even when they have their own
[1:31:21] youth meeting
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:24] but after their they still came to
[1:31:25] support
[1:31:28] ours and I know even this year they are
[1:31:30] going to have
[1:31:33] theirs which we are intending to
[1:31:37] support and I'm sure they intending to
[1:31:39] support
[1:31:41] our it's a blessing to have men of
[1:31:44] God that do not have Mo other motives in
[1:31:48] preaching the
[1:31:50] gospel but they just have one
[1:31:54] motive the
[1:31:56] souls you know those are usually God
[1:31:59] called
[1:32:00] men and I've sat down with brother
[1:32:02] Robert several
[1:32:04] times and I can you know tell you
[1:32:07] without missing my
[1:32:09] words I believe he A God Called
[1:32:12] man I believe that with all my
[1:32:16] heart his only business is to send out
[1:32:18] the
[1:32:20] message printing a lot of messages

[1:32:26] here when we went

[1:57:41] from home how can you be blessed and yet
[1:57:44] you have no home how can you be blessed
[1:57:48] and you have no
[1:57:51] pillow pillow he had was a stone and he

[1:58:00] there then then a dream comes is that
[1:58:04] amen at the very
[1:58:06] spot where he laid where he put his head
[1:58:11] without knowing that the Lord had L the
[1:58:15] Bible says the feet of

[1:58:28] like you running away sometimes you have
[1:58:31] lost it but you have not lost it why God
[1:58:36] is still in control if God has chosen
[1:58:39] you he knows
[1:58:41] exactly where you are is that amen and

[2:16:20] gates they will not enter they will not
[2:16:24] enter they will not

[2:17:39] is a gate where everybody will
[2:17:42] enter the tribes will enter certain is
[2:17:48] that amen and then the Bible is telling
[2:17:50] us every gate has got a

[3:37:13] I just want you
[3:37:15] to before you leave this
[3:37:19] place just take a moment
[3:37:22] now while you close your
[3:37:24] eyes to meditate a little bit about what
[3:37:27] we have
[3:37:28] [Music]
[3:37:32] heard the Gate of
[3:37:35] Heaven did you
[3:37:37] know we are the people
[3:37:42] that have arrived at that
[3:37:44] [Music]
[3:37:45] place where Jacob
[3:37:50] was but the problem of it
[3:37:53] is people are still running
[3:37:58] away why your life is still the same and
[3:38:00] there is no change because you're still
[3:38:02] running
[3:38:05] away but if you can come to yourself
[3:38:11] and you
[3:38:13] realize what God is doing in our
[3:38:17] generation like
[3:38:19] Jacob you will
[3:38:22] realize I'm in the house of
[3:38:25] God where his
[3:38:27] [Music]
[3:38:29] bread his bread for the end
[3:38:31] [Music]
[3:38:33] time has been
[3:38:35] SED Jesus has a table
[3:38:38] spread where his Saints have
[3:38:42] fed and he's inviting you come and
[3:38:45] die oh this is the message of the
[3:38:48] hour we have an
[3:38:51] invitation to come to the house of God
[3:38:53] is
[3:38:55] PR we will not need to pray and fast for
[3:38:58] the for the gate to be open because it
[3:39:00] has already been
[3:39:02] [Music]
[3:39:04] open healing is
[3:39:09] yours what do you have need
[3:39:12] of whatever you have need
[3:39:14] of is
[3:39:17] yours is
[3:39:22] yours the man of God has been an angel
[3:39:24] of God ministering to
[3:39:29] you if only you can receive a personal
[3:39:32] [Music]
[3:39:34] revelation what this
[3:39:39] is
[3:39:43] it was not a
[3:39:45] coincidence that Jesus Christ was born
[3:39:47] in
[3:39:51] Bethlehem where the man of God Jacob had
[3:39:53] seen the Revelation
[3:39:57] already of the
[3:39:59] [Music]
[3:40:05] place and the man of God has read to us
[3:40:07] a
[3:40:09] court
[3:40:10] [Music]
[3:40:11] and he said he built his Tabernacle of
[3:40:14] [Music]
[3:40:16] Flesh and
[3:40:18] [Music]
[3:40:20] Bones and lived in that
[3:40:23] Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With
[3:40:27] Us he built himself a
[3:40:31] house to live in it so he could reflect
[3:40:35] his
[3:40:36] word to his
[3:40:39] subjects through
[3:40:42] that you know what God
[3:40:45] is when you see
[3:40:50] Christ where is
[3:40:53] Christ the Bible says that there shall
[3:40:55] be many false
[3:40:59] anointed many false Christ in the end
[3:41:03] time but God has sent
[3:41:06] us the true anointed one
[3:41:11] the messenger the angel the star of this
[3:41:13] [Music]
[3:41:16] generation to come and restore us back
[3:41:18] to the
