[1:07:14] wedding so uh you are going to make this
[1:07:18] sound better this sound does not sound
[1:07:20] good my sound especially this one by the

[1:07:27] so uh we I want to ask again how many
[1:07:32] here enjoyed the wedding
[1:07:34] yesterday oh my we had a had a good time
[1:07:38] I think it was a good
[1:07:38] [Music]
[1:07:40] ceremony wasn't it a good
[1:07:43] ceremony I believe it was a good
[1:07:46] ceremony it was a good ceremony
[1:07:48] indeed and we we thank God for it we
[1:07:52] thank God for brother Andrew brother
[1:07:54] Andrew thank God for uh sister
[1:07:57] phbe they did not embarrass
[1:08:00] us uh you know like I I've been
[1:08:04] wrestling with many of you young
[1:08:07] men I was I really wrestled with brother
[1:08:11] Andrew and
[1:08:13] uh he's not here but I'll share this
[1:08:18] testimony it came to a
[1:08:21] point that he was feeling he was going
[1:08:23] overage
[1:08:26] and he said
[1:08:27] pastor I've
[1:08:29] tried but I can't find a
[1:08:32] wife and I'm giving
[1:08:35] up and I'm going to marry an
[1:08:42] unbeliever so I looked at
[1:08:45] him and I told him brother
[1:08:48] and you want to marry an
[1:08:51] unbeliever it is all right with me
[1:08:55] this is your
[1:08:56] choice you see if you an
[1:09:00] unbeliever you will not go to
[1:09:02] hell but if you
[1:09:05] unbeliever you bring hell to
[1:09:10] yourself so it is your
[1:09:12] choice and I told him when the prophet
[1:09:16] says under no
[1:09:19] circumstance it does not
[1:09:21] mean that if you marry an unbeliever
[1:09:24] it will take you to
[1:09:25] hell but it will bring hell in your
[1:09:29] life whereby you will have a you will be
[1:09:34] pierced it's like sitting on a
[1:09:39] throne and you be piered throughout your
[1:09:42] life you will not be
[1:09:45] happy because you are two different
[1:09:48] people from two different uh aspects of
[1:09:52] life
[1:09:55] and you want to be
[1:09:57] sure that you you marry someone who
[1:10:00] believes like you
[1:10:02] do not only that but Maring
[1:10:06] someone who has true
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:10] love true love can only be received by
[1:10:14] someone receiving the Holy
[1:10:16] Spirit that's what I preached on
[1:10:21] yester the bis of love
[1:10:26] it is true
[1:10:28] love that the Bible calls
[1:10:31] charity that one cannot
[1:10:34] fail but if you Maring on the basis of
[1:10:37] feelings which you call
[1:10:41] love oh when I think about that
[1:10:45] person
[1:10:48] me it's just
[1:10:50] feelings and that can be there tomorrow
[1:10:53] it will not be
[1:10:55] and you don't want to marry on that
[1:10:59] basis you want to marry a daughter of
[1:11:02] God so I told those things to brother
[1:11:06] Andre and I wrestled with
[1:11:10] him and I told him but brother
[1:11:12] Andre one more thing I'll tell
[1:11:15] you everything is done by
[1:11:20] faith you believe by faith you go to
[1:11:24] Heaven by faith you receive the Holy
[1:11:26] Spirit by faith even a good
[1:11:28] wife you find her by
[1:11:31] faith you may not you may not see her in
[1:11:33] the church you may not even see in other
[1:11:37] churches actually young people at dvf
[1:11:39] you have a wonderful
[1:11:43] opportunity
[1:11:47] every all the young people all over the
[1:11:52] country come to
[1:11:56] you but even after one
[1:11:59] year of hosting a youth
[1:12:03] meeting he did not find
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:06] any and his wife was there but he didn't
[1:12:08] see
[1:12:12] her but I told him it is faith that does
[1:12:18] it and uh he said okay pastor brother
[1:12:23] Andrew is not a man that
[1:12:26] uh has a hard
[1:12:29] heart he has a soft heart when you adise
[1:12:34] him he hears and takes
[1:12:38] Cel all the people all the young people
[1:12:40] that have married through my
[1:12:44] hands I will tell you one thing about
[1:12:47] them M gave his testimony here
[1:12:50] I'm they all listen to C
[1:12:54] if you do not listen to the C of
[1:12:58] your and You Begin your marriage on that
[1:13:03] basis I can almost tell you you be
[1:13:08] doomed I'm telling you you have to
[1:13:11] listen to
[1:13:13] Cel it will help you it will go a long
[1:13:17] way in a way for
[1:13:19] you and said okay
[1:13:21] pastor what can I now I said what you
[1:13:25] can do is very
[1:13:27] simple just
[1:13:29] believe that God is able to give you a
[1:13:33] wife he said pastor I'm giving God only
[1:13:36] one
[1:13:38] month I told I told Brother Andrew you
[1:13:42] can even give him three
[1:13:44] days but if you take him at his
[1:13:48] word and you believe it we will pray
[1:13:53] believe it and he will do it and I told
[1:13:57] him you just need to stay in
[1:14:02] fellowship and then later on I
[1:14:05] emphasized you want an
[1:14:07] unbeliever I can even
[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:10] you but that's that will be your
[1:14:15] help so he said no I've
[1:14:18] decided I'm not going
[1:14:21] to just pray for me
[1:14:24] to bring my
[1:14:26] wife so we
[1:14:28] hands and we
[1:14:31] prayed in that same
[1:14:34] month he gave God one
[1:14:36] month in that same month I think was the
[1:14:39] third
[1:14:40] week he came back to
[1:14:43] me I have found
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:46] her hallelujah amen I found her I've

[1:42:24] follow are you under expectation this
[1:42:28] morning I certainly feel privileged to
[1:42:30] stand before
[1:42:32] you many thanks to the
[1:42:37] pastor I like words to
[1:42:40] describe he's a man that has had an
[1:42:42] impact in my
[1:42:46] life in the
[1:42:49] ministry and it's to find such
[1:42:53] people especially in the
[1:42:55] message for a pastor to give his
[1:43:00] Pulpit someone like me as young as I
[1:43:03] am it's not something
[1:43:06] easy they they tell you sit down young
[1:43:11] man eat the word first young man eat the

[1:43:18] and exercise this gifts when we come and
[1:43:22] EXC we are right in the line of the
[1:43:25] scripture because there has to be a mod
[1:43:29] David

[1:43:34] Titus we thank the Lord for this open
[1:43:39] door that we can
[1:43:41] stand and I know this is
[1:43:43] home so I feel so happy to be here and
[1:43:47] to have been part of the first weddding
[1:43:50] in div
[1:43:54] and we really thank the Lord for this
[1:43:56] testimony it's just an encouragement I
[1:43:59] will
[1:44:01] say that there are Cel and
[1:44:06] prayers is bearing
[1:44:09] fruits and I believe it's going to be a
[1:44:11] Gateway

[1:44:17] more we just wish you guys all the best
[1:44:21] down in Nairobi Kenya I bring
[1:44:24] greetings from my
[1:44:26] pastor from other
[1:44:28] Brethren so many of them sent me with
[1:44:31] greetings brother Paul brother
[1:44:34] morus be preaching for them in Nairobi
[1:44:37] today have brothers that you do not know
[1:44:41] them but I believe you'll get to know
[1:44:43] them
[1:44:45] if brother M brother
[1:44:48] Moses good friends of our pastor
[1:44:52] we had him for quite some time
[1:44:55] there was a real blessing to
[1:44:57] us and I know sometimes it may sound
[1:45:02] cliche you know it's said over and over
[1:45:08] again but Brethren you're
[1:45:12] blessed don't ever get used to your
[1:45:16] pastor you might walk close to your
[1:45:19] pastor but remember this is a man given
[1:45:21] to you by
[1:45:25] God for you to receive the benefits that
[1:45:28] you lead in this
[1:45:32] life don't get used to
[1:45:35] him I know it's something strange to
[1:45:37] say when you get so familiar with
[1:45:41] someone to see them you can be able to
[1:45:43] even meet them on the
[1:45:46] street but if you want to reap the
[1:45:49] benefits what God has put in this
[1:45:52] man do not be familiar with
[1:45:55] him Accord him the respect and the honor
[1:45:58] he
[1:46:00] deserves pray for him because if you do
[1:46:03] not see the value that he has to you
[1:46:04] being that he's
[1:46:08] here I want you to know he's of value to
[1:46:11] many
[1:46:14] others so now that you have him
[1:46:16] here utilize him to the best way that
[1:46:19] can
[1:46:23] we can speak so much congratulations to
[1:46:26] the new
[1:46:29] couple I've had an experience of a
[1:46:31] Ugandan
[1:46:33] wedding together with my brother
[1:46:38] Prince we have quite a
[1:46:42] report but anyway since we came to
[1:46:44] preach the
[1:46:45] word let's turn to the
[1:46:48] scriptures in the Book of Daniel chap
[1:46:50] chapter
[1:46:52] 11 and I request that you pray for
[1:46:55] me uh the thought that I have is quite
[1:46:59] white I may not be able to push it in in
[1:47:01] one
[1:47:02] service but I just pray for the time
[1:47:05] that I shall be
[1:47:06] here I'll just give you the
[1:47:09] thought plant an idea in your
[1:47:13] heart and my prayers I was studying and
[1:47:18] preparing that I asked the Lord
[1:47:21] may this little
[1:47:23] idea be a
[1:47:26] spark that will ignite the lives of the
[1:47:31] Brethren so I pray that you'll also pray
[1:47:33] with
[1:47:34] me as you speak these things Daniel
[1:47:40] 11:32 and such as do wickedly against
[1:47:42] the Covenant shall he corrupt by
[1:47:49] flatteries
[1:48:02] but whenever you see the
[1:48:05] word it changes
[1:48:08] everything remember
[1:48:10] Peter I've toed all
[1:48:13] night I have got
[1:48:15] nothing
[1:48:17] nevertheless
[1:48:19] but when you say
[1:48:21] B everything that has been said
[1:48:24] before to be wiped
[1:48:26] away because there's something else that
[1:48:29] is going to come
[1:48:30] next you need to pay attention
[1:48:34] to so the people that do
[1:48:37] wickedly is that for you if you're a
[1:48:41] wicked person you get until
[1:48:47] there behold I go
[1:48:51] send you Elijah the
[1:48:53] prophet send
[1:48:55] you I God sent
[1:48:59] you before Elijah
[1:49:01] came you are there because I will send
[1:49:05] you
[1:49:07] Prophet without you there's no
[1:49:11] Prophet but here's the
[1:49:13] catch
[1:49:15] before the
[1:49:19] coming great and Dreadful day of the
[1:49:24] Lord uhhuh there's a prophet
[1:49:26] coming are you waiting for a dreadful
[1:49:30] day to them that are waiting for his
[1:49:33] appearing it is a great day to
[1:49:36] them so we want to read the
[1:49:39] scripture get the whole
[1:49:43] context but not be like chicken and say
[1:49:46] this is not for
[1:49:48] us it may not apply to to
[1:49:51] me it is a warning to
[1:49:54] me simply because I
[1:49:56] know I will not do
[1:49:59] wickedly let me go to the next
[1:50:02] part and
[1:50:04] see God this is the reward of the
[1:50:08] wicked I don't plan on being
[1:50:12] Wicked what about
[1:50:16] me God is a just
[1:50:19] rewarder
[1:50:22] he's a
[1:50:23] rewarder of them that diligently
[1:50:28] seek but the
[1:50:30] people that do know their
[1:50:34] God people that know their God do wicked
[1:50:39] things but the people that do their that
[1:50:41] do know their
[1:50:43] God they shall be
[1:50:47] strong hallelujah amen that is why we
[1:50:49] were
[1:50:51] singing there's a song that calls all of
[1:50:53] my
[1:50:54] strength is in
[1:50:57] you early in the
[1:50:59] morning during the
[1:51:01] daytime at night all of my
[1:51:06] strength is you
[1:51:08] God so as a strong
[1:51:11] person how do you define
[1:51:15] strength you did not Define
[1:51:18] strength by the muscles the
[1:51:22] arms you do not even measure
[1:51:30] strength your strength is
[1:51:33] measured by The
[1:51:35] Works that you
[1:51:40] do let's go to First John chapter
[1:51:44] 5 14 to
[1:51:48] 15 so we know
[1:51:51] there are people that do wickedly
[1:51:52] against the
[1:51:55] Covenant but being that is not our
[1:51:59] portion we take that scripture as a
[1:52:01] warning
[1:52:02] yes but we look for our
[1:52:06] portion now this is the thing there are
[1:52:10] people who know they
[1:52:11] God when you know
[1:52:14] something and you know that you
[1:52:17] know the Bible is defining you as a
[1:52:19] strong person
[1:52:22] and it says he will do
[1:52:25] exploits first John 5:14
[1:52:30] says and this is is the confidence that
[1:52:33] we have in
[1:52:34] him that if you ask anything according
[1:52:37] to his will he heareth
[1:52:48] us
[1:52:56] you have a
[1:52:58] confidence that when I ask according to
[1:53:01] his
[1:53:02] will he will
[1:53:04] hear that is for a people who know their
[1:53:12] God praise the Lord amen and if we
[1:53:16] know so the knowledge is continuing
[1:53:22] we know our
[1:53:23] God and we have confidence in
[1:53:26] him and we have confidence that he hears
[1:53:30] us and if we know that he hears us
[1:53:34] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[1:53:37] the petitions that we desired of
[1:53:48] him
[1:53:56] I know my
[1:53:57] God I have confidence in me I I have
[1:54:01] confidence in him I know that he hears
[1:54:04] me and big that I know he hears
[1:54:07] me I know that whatever I have
[1:54:10] asked I have
[1:54:13] it this is for our people who
[1:54:17] know and we know let me jump to
[1:54:21] 19 and we know that we are of
[1:54:28] God oh we know we are of
[1:54:32] God and the whole world lith in
[1:54:41] wickedness I want you to see something
[1:54:44] here John speaks
[1:54:47] about people that know God and wicked
[1:54:52] Daniel spoke of the
[1:54:55] same Daniel spoke of the
[1:54:58] same wickedness and people who know they
[1:55:03] God so we want to really bring a good
[1:55:08] demarcation I know we
[1:55:11] stand yes we want to do
[1:55:15] a and say you're either a wicked
[1:55:18] person and
[1:55:20] remember the
[1:55:22] wickedness and the strength of knowing
[1:55:25] your
[1:55:26] God will be seen by The Works that you
[1:55:29] [Applause]

[1:57:07] Lord Jesus you can have your
[1:57:09] seat I want to speak about this
[1:57:13] afternoon a very small
[1:57:16] thought I've preached on on the subject
[1:57:19] uh some different texts on
[1:57:25] it I've been speaking about I
[1:57:28] know and when I knew that I was coming
[1:57:31] to this
[1:57:32] site I was really struggling in my heart
[1:57:35] and asking God what can I speak
[1:57:38] on and I still fa to continue in the
[1:57:41] same
[1:57:43] line but I want to bring a different
[1:57:47] thought and for a text I want to use
[1:57:49] this
[1:57:50] words led to a
[1:57:54] faith I've never had
[1:57:58] before I'm speaking
[1:58:00] about a
[1:58:02] faith I've never had
[1:58:06] before a faith I've never had
[1:58:10] before we know that Christian life is a
[1:58:14] journey oh
[1:58:17] sorry I have never had like it's this
[1:58:20] towel I've never had this towel
[1:58:23] before a type of
[1:58:25] faith that I have never had
[1:58:29] before no we know a Christian Life is a
[1:58:32] life of
[1:58:33] growth grow from Grace to Grace from
[1:58:37] glory to glory from anointing to
[1:58:39] anointing from power to power and I want
[1:58:42] to tell you this afternoon you also grow
[1:58:47] from
[1:58:48] faith to Faith that is what we are
[1:58:51] talking about being
[1:58:54] led the spirit of God leading
[1:58:57] you to this place where you get a faith
[1:59:01] that you've never had
[1:59:05] before our Christian Life is a life of
[1:59:10] faith brother tells
[1:59:12] us standing up from your seat and
[1:59:16] walking that he takes faith you've got
[1:59:19] to have faith that your legs are going
[1:59:22] to be able to
[1:59:24] your whatever it is that you do there's
[1:59:27] an aspect of
[1:59:29] Faith he says that faith is so
[1:59:33] unconscious it doesn't have to be
[1:59:36] intellectual it is just
[1:59:39] there you may not know it but you have
[1:59:43] faith you have faith as
[1:59:46] simple that when you breathe in you have
[1:59:49] faith that that air will go to your
[1:59:55] lungs that air will be absorbed in the
[2:00:00] blood it will go to the brain it will go
[2:00:02] to the heart it will go to each and
[2:00:04] every
[2:00:06] place how does it happen I don't know
[2:00:10] but it takes
[2:00:12] faith that is why there are certain
[2:00:15] people people that have a negative
[2:00:18] attitude they do not believe that they
[2:00:20] can be able to do a particular
[2:00:23] thing and for sure they try to do
[2:00:26] it and it
[2:00:28] fails simply because they do not have
[2:00:32] that simple faith that they can do
[2:00:36] it but I want to tell you there are
[2:00:39] different levels of
[2:00:41] Faith yes there are different levels of
[2:00:46] Faith so uh pastor preached to us one
[2:00:48] time
[2:00:49] time and he was telling us that faith is
[2:00:53] so
[2:00:54] simple we the ones who tend to
[2:00:56] complicate it
[2:00:58] sometimes when you Ser when you've
[2:01:00] served your meal maybe it's
[2:01:04] lunch you've put the meal on the
[2:01:06] table you tell the Lord bless this food
[2:01:11] may you sanctify it before I eat it you
[2:01:15] do not wait for an angel to come from
[2:01:18] heaven do not wait for the pillar of
[2:01:20] fire to come and overover over the food
[2:01:24] for you to know that it is
[2:01:26] Sanctified after saying amen you pick
[2:01:29] your
[2:01:31] spoon oh in in Uganda there are not
[2:01:34] spoons you pick your
[2:01:36] fork and you di into the
[2:01:39] F that is
[2:01:42] Faith and that is the faith that I want
[2:01:44] to talk about
[2:01:46] today the faith of you've gotten to a
[2:01:50] place where you have
[2:01:53] confidence and you can stand and
[2:01:56] say
[2:02:04] I and I want to ask
[2:02:06] you what is it that you know this
[2:02:10] afternoon Bible tells us in First
[2:02:13] Corinthians chter
[2:02:15] 13 vers 11 to
[2:02:17] 12
[2:02:21] Saint I want to leave this pull
[2:02:23] pit I want to leave this pull pit uring
[2:02:27] that we've gotten
[2:02:29] somewhere and I know I have a short
[2:02:32] time but if you catch it within 30
[2:02:36] minutes I'll be out of
[2:02:39] here but I'm not going to live here
[2:02:42] until you catch
[2:02:44] it the sooner you forget other
[2:02:47] things soon you're here
[2:02:51] 100% a quick short
[2:02:54] work you get to a place of
[2:02:57] know we shall be out of you 1
[2:03:00] Corinthians
[2:03:03] 13 11
[2:03:06] 12 when I was a
[2:03:09] child I speak as a
[2:03:11] child I spake as a
[2:03:14] child I understood as a
[2:03:17] child
[2:03:20] I thought as a
[2:03:23] child so the
[2:03:27] understanding which Builds on the
[2:03:32] thinking which Builds on the
[2:03:36] speaking is like that of a
[2:03:40] child but he
[2:03:42] says but when I became a
[2:03:46] man I put away childish
[2:03:50] things I put away childish
[2:03:54] understanding I put away childish
[2:03:57] thinking I put away childish
[2:04:02] speaking it is unfortunate we're
[2:04:04] Believers of the
[2:04:06] message but some of our conversations
[2:04:08] are childish
[2:04:11] conversations some of our thinking is
[2:04:13] childish
[2:04:15] thinking some of our understanding is
[2:04:17] childish understanding
[2:04:20] some of the things we have in the
[2:04:21] message
[2:04:23] today is because people still have a
[2:04:25] children
[2:04:28] mentality start and
[2:04:30] say we are bringing brother Bram in the
[2:04:32] pull
[2:04:35] pit that is childish
[2:04:39] thinking to start
[2:04:42] with can I have the pull pit for the
[2:04:44] time that I'm here to start with I never
[2:04:48] removed brother Bram from this
[2:04:51] pulit you bring back something that you
[2:04:54] had
[2:04:56] removed these are people that have moved
[2:04:59] away from Brother bram's
[2:05:03] message trying to sanctify or sanitize
[2:05:06] their
[2:05:08] conscience playing AE in the
[2:05:12] church but in real
[2:05:14] sense they need a holy ghost fi preacher
[2:05:19] come tell them get back in the
[2:05:24] line
[2:05:26] amen so we are putting away childish
[2:05:31] thinking but see as a full grown
[2:05:34] man you can take the
[2:05:37] Bible the Bible and the message is the
[2:05:40] same there is no
[2:05:42] difference because the same same Bible
[2:05:44] will tell
[2:05:46] you Hallelujah I don't know I'm getting
[2:05:49] in this
[2:05:50] life maybe there's someone here and
[2:05:52] maybe there's
[2:05:56] someone we have Malachi chapter
[2:06:00] 4 what does that speak
[2:06:02] of speaks of brother
[2:06:05] Bram that we know for
[2:06:07] sure we have Ephesians chapter
[2:06:10] 4 what does that speak of the fivefold
[2:06:14] ministry but brother it doesn't end
[2:06:17] there we also have Revelation chapter
[2:06:22] 4 where John himself is
[2:06:25] saying and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[2:06:28] talking to me and telling me come up
[2:06:34] higher brother Bram is not the
[2:06:39] standard the fivefold ministry is not
[2:06:41] the
[2:06:43] standard Jesus Christ is a
[2:06:46] standard you Pi brother told you you
[2:06:50] pick up brother I'm told you you've
[2:06:53] taken a
[2:06:54] step you come to church listen to what
[2:06:58] the
[2:06:59] ministry you've taken a
[2:07:01] step that is not the end of the

[2:07:56] back
[2:07:59] backup yes substitute sub you can be
[2:08:03] able to name all of
[2:08:05] them but you're coming to church you

[2:11:17] thinking is
[2:11:19] gone so we want to approach
[2:11:22] this and be able to get to an
[2:11:25] understanding but before we get to that
[2:11:27] I
[2:11:29] know I want to bring something across to
[2:11:33] you says this
[2:11:35] statement and he says
[2:11:38] Christians I am not trying to hurt
[2:11:40] you I am not I'm trying to stimulate
[2:11:43] your
[2:11:46] faith don't pay attention to what
[2:11:49] anybody tells you if it is contrary to
[2:11:51] that says the
[2:11:57] Lord and at the bottom there he says Now
[2:12:00] put on your thinking
[2:12:04] cup at this time he was
[2:12:06] closing but for now we
[2:12:09] opening I'm going to tell you put on

[2:12:40] afternoon because I want us to start
[2:12:44] thinking I want you to
[2:12:46] know before you get to to that place of
[2:12:50] knowing there are certain things that
[2:12:52] you need to
[2:12:54] understand and you need to
[2:12:57] understand before you know there's a God
[2:13:01] in heaven who
[2:13:03] knows sometimes we go through so many
[2:13:05] things in
[2:13:06] life and we start
[2:13:08] wondering does God know what I'm going
[2:13:11] through you're in school you're in
[2:13:13] college in high
[2:13:16] school there so many in the work
[2:13:20] environment and you're

[2:13:25] through having to wear this long
[2:13:28] dress my colleagues and my peers are
[2:13:31] painting their nails and their
[2:13:33] faces and I always feel I can not
[2:13:38] boy does God know what I'm going

[2:13:53] say that some of us grow up to a certain
[2:13:58] extent but in
[2:14:00] reality we are nursing childhood
[2:14:05] traumas certain
[2:14:08] experiences that shaped our lives in a
[2:14:10] certain
[2:14:11] direction and you get into those moments

[2:14:37] up struggling with

[2:19:44] things so
[2:19:45] now by his
[2:19:48] eyes there was a
[2:19:50] sea that was standing before
[2:19:53] them have you ever been in a
[2:19:56] situation you are in a
[2:19:58] fix you didn't
[2:20:00] know how things worked
[2:20:03] out it is because God has
[2:20:07] eyes Angry
[2:20:12] Eyes sister there was there was a young
[2:20:15] man from the
[2:20:16] world
[2:20:17] that was trying to approach your
[2:20:20] inbox you are faithful in your
[2:20:23] heart and right now you look

[2:20:33] Angry
[2:20:36] Eyes amen there's a time that your
[2:20:38] business was going

[2:20:58] [Applause]
[2:20:59] one amen be conscious of these things
[2:21:05] Saints be conscious of these
[2:21:07] things Hebrews
[2:21:10] chapter praise God praise God
[2:21:14] Amen Hebrews chapter 2: 16 Hebrews
[2:21:21] for
[2:21:23] verily he took not on him the nature of
[2:21:27] angels but he took on him the Seed of
[2:21:40] Abraham
[2:21:46] sorry
[2:21:50] he
[2:21:51] chose he
[2:21:54] chose Hebrews
[2:21:58] 2:16 he did not come as an
[2:22:01] angel but he decided to take on the form
[2:22:03] of the Seed of
[2:22:08] Abraham and he says verse
[2:22:10] 17 wherefore in all
[2:22:16] things
[2:22:18] it behoved him to be made like unto his
[2:22:25] brethren we have God
[2:22:28] above and then we have
[2:22:30] angels and then human
[2:22:32] beings so God
[2:22:35] himself decided to come to the lowest
[2:22:40] of he could have come as an
[2:22:43] angel but he didn't he could have
[2:22:46] decided to stay as
[2:22:48] God but he
[2:22:50] didn't but in all
[2:22:53] things all
[2:22:56] things it behoved him to be made like
[2:22:59] unto his
[2:23:02] bre you know now I might come to your
[2:23:06] house assuming you're not well
[2:23:09] off and you will only give
[2:23:13] [Music]
[2:23:15] me there'll be no at
[2:23:18] all and maybe that day that I'm visiting
[2:23:22] you I come with some
[2:23:24] meat and you cook for me that meat eat
[2:23:27] it together and then I go back
[2:23:31] home but that's not
[2:23:34] God you only
[2:23:36] have and
[2:23:38] ground that is what I will come and that
[2:23:41] is what we shall
[2:23:45] eat God
[2:23:47] as he came as a human
[2:23:49] being he came so that he can be like you
[2:23:52] in all
[2:23:56] things let's finish this and then we'll
[2:23:58] read that that he might be a merciful
[2:24:00] and faithful high priest in things
[2:24:02] pertaining to
[2:24:04] God to make reconciliation for the sins
[2:24:06] of the people
[2:24:16] 17
[2:24:32] for in that he himself has suffered
[2:24:34] being tempted
[2:24:40] W look at your situation
[2:24:43] now as you're talking about these Saints
[2:24:45] this is not theory that I'm giving you
[2:24:49] the reason I'm preaching it like
[2:24:51] this because I
[2:24:54] know so I know that you also know these
[2:24:58] things so let us get
[2:25:00] ready be able to se God for who he
[2:25:03] really
[2:25:05] is because many of times you either pray
[2:25:07] or
[2:25:09] Miss and we end up missing on so many
[2:25:12] things because we do not know our
[2:25:14] God but let us know our God
[2:25:18] he himself had suffered being
[2:25:24] tempted the biggest Tri that you've gone
[2:25:27] through what the biggest Temptation that
[2:25:29] you've gone
[2:25:31] through he is able to Su them that are
[2:25:43] tempted he went through all those things
[2:25:46] so so that as you are going through
[2:25:51] them he can be able to be coming there
[2:25:53] with
[2:25:54] you
[2:25:56] son you can do this my daughter you can
[2:26:01] do this so we see one time brother
[2:26:05] Bram Ser God
[2:26:07] faithfully and was just s there
[2:26:10] wondering oh God I look at other
[2:26:15] pies this great
[2:26:18] evangelist they seem to have done so
[2:26:20] much for the kingdom of
[2:26:22] God see that have done so
[2:26:24] little they have so much
[2:26:28] money it seemed like I don't even have
[2:26:31] anything and he was just there
[2:26:34] wondering and questioning
[2:26:36] God what is wrong with me God oh God

[2:27:02] connected the only way I can be
[2:27:05] swept the only way I can be
[2:27:08] swept is if I'm not
[2:27:11] connected but if I am
[2:27:14] connected remember that ship
[2:27:18] that is on the
[2:27:19] sea no matter how much the storms may
[2:27:24] ra the wind
[2:27:27] blow everything will come and toss the
[2:27:30] Sheep but there's an

[2:32:07] down he became
[2:32:09] man and brother Bram says he's not
[2:32:13] ashamed to be called our
[2:32:15] brother
[2:32:19] look at yourself in a holy
[2:32:23] state in your lowely
[2:32:27] state he could have stayed as
[2:32:30] God and tried to do what he could have
[2:32:32] been able to do
[2:32:35] from but he didn't do
[2:32:40] that he could have come as an
[2:32:43] angel come with a proclamation and a
[2:32:45] message
[2:32:48] but he didn't do
[2:32:49] that he came
[2:32:54] down do you know the reason why when we
[2:32:58] preach we insist that you must go all
[2:33:00] the
[2:33:02] way because
[2:33:04] Jesus also went all the
[2:33:07] way he does not do any halfway
[2:33:11] jobs some he
[2:33:13] says when he saves he serves
[2:33:18] completely when he heals he heals
[2:33:22] completely Jesus goes all the
[2:33:26] way he left the seventh
[2:33:30] Dimension and went all the
[2:33:33] way where human beings
[2:33:36] are that was not
[2:33:38] enough he went all the
[2:33:41] way of
[2:33:44] hell why did he do that so that when he
[2:33:48] comes and tells you keep pressing the
[2:33:52] botle you will look at his
[2:33:55] life and say
[2:33:57] Jesus just as you
[2:34:00] overcame and you're Seated on your
[2:34:02] father's
[2:34:03] thr I will
[2:34:05] overcome and sit on your
[2:34:09] throne that's the
[2:34:11] promise for the ENT
[2:34:15] believer but you're
[2:34:17] wondering how can I
[2:34:21] overcome it's okay we will get
[2:34:23] there but let us know our
[2:34:26] God because when we know our
[2:34:29] God we will know who saved
[2:34:32] us and we know he does not do halfway
[2:34:36] job he's he's not ashamed to be called
[2:34:39] our
[2:34:41] brother for he was tempted just like we
[2:34:43] are
[2:34:45] tempted because he stood the same kind
[2:34:47] of attemptation that you
[2:34:54] stand listen to this now and he took
[2:34:57] your
[2:35:01] place knowing that you couldn't take it
[2:35:11] yourself amen is that thinking clearly
[2:35:22] the reason why he came
[2:35:25] down and that's the reason that
[2:35:28] Christ
[2:35:30] God God had to become king folks to
[2:35:36] us and he come down and was made a
[2:35:40] man and he suffered
[2:35:43] Temptation and he was laugh at
[2:35:47] and made fun
[2:35:49] of and
[2:35:52] persecuted and
[2:35:56] ignored and called B
[2:35:59] boob and scoffed
[2:36:02] at and suffer death under capital
[2:36:10] punishment he had to be king folks to
[2:36:14] us
[2:36:17] he had he had to be falsely
[2:36:21] accused because you are falsely
[2:36:27] accused get these words
[2:36:30] clearly you are falsely
[2:36:34] accused he had to Bear
[2:36:38] sickness because you are
[2:36:44] sick he had to
[2:36:47] sins because it was your
[2:36:52] sins and he had to become Ken
[2:36:57] folks the only way he could redeem
[2:37:01] us was to be king folks to
[2:37:06] us and how did he become king
[2:37:09] folk by taking on the form of sinful
[2:37:14] flesh
[2:37:17] and he paid the price for our
[2:37:22] Redemption so now we
[2:37:24] see the
[2:37:29] word means to
[2:37:33] sympathize suffered all these
[2:37:36] things so that he can Su you when you
[2:37:43] tempted so that he can simp
[2:37:46] so that he can sympathize with
[2:37:49] you and there's nobody that can
[2:37:51] sympathize with you if they do not feel
[2:37:53] your
[2:37:56] pain so
[2:37:58] he he knows your
[2:38:00] pain he knows what you've gone
[2:38:03] through and that's the reason he become
[2:38:06] this that he might be sympathetic with
[2:38:11] you when you have your ups and
[2:38:14] downs
[2:38:16] and your little ins and
[2:38:20] outs he knows how to sympathize with
[2:38:26] you he sits there to make
[2:38:29] intercessions he sits there to love
[2:38:32] you and though you go
[2:38:36] astray he will not leave
[2:38:39] you and now can I tell you one
[2:38:42] thing if you know these things you
[2:38:46] cannot go
[2:38:48] astray because you already
[2:38:50] know I cannot go deep in
[2:38:54] sin the moment I do something
[2:38:57] wrong I run quickly and
[2:38:59] repent I will not
[2:39:02] let this conversations with a
[2:39:05] sister end up to meeting with her
[2:39:07] without the parents knowledge or
[2:39:09] something like
[2:39:12] that I wouldn't let it go to that place
[2:39:14] where
[2:39:16] we are talking late in the
[2:39:18] night we are meeting in certain
[2:39:21] places because you are a person who
[2:39:23] knows your
[2:39:26] god what we
[2:39:28] need is to get to a place
[2:39:31] where we get to know our
[2:39:34] God because when we know
[2:39:37] God there are certain things no matter
[2:39:39] how we go
[2:39:42] through we will be able to stand and say
[2:39:46] before I went through
[2:39:49] this God saw
[2:39:51] it God knows it so you go back to
[2:39:56] God and inquire from
[2:39:59] God God should die
[2:40:05] do because God has an answer for every
[2:40:10] situation God has an answer for
[2:40:13] everything I hope we can be able to see
[2:40:15] that
[2:40:16] now that this God has a
[2:40:19] hand that his ears are not
[2:40:22] heavy that his eyes can be able to
[2:40:26] see and that is why he could tell
[2:40:31] Jeremiah he tells him that even before
[2:40:33] you were
[2:40:35] born let me just get that exact
[2:40:38] scripture in
[2:40:40] Jeremiah 1 verse
[2:40:44] 5
[2:40:47] we want to a we want to get to a place
[2:40:49] where we will know
[2:40:51] right says before I formed the in the
[2:40:54] belly I knew thee before thou camest
[2:40:58] forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee
[2:41:01] and ordained the a prophet unto the
[2:41:07] Nations 1 verse
[2:41:14] 5
[2:41:33] Jeremiah
[2:41:35] 29 I know the thoughts that I think
[2:41:38] towards of peace and not of evil to give
[2:41:43] you an expected end
[2:41:45] also show you that God has already
[2:41:47] planned out
[2:41:49] everything where we really miss out
[2:41:52] on is we get out of the plan of
[2:41:55] God Sint if God is making you go through
[2:41:58] a certain
[2:42:01] trial God has a reason for
[2:42:03] it remember what he said concerning
[2:42:06] job the devil was there and it was like
[2:42:10] have you seen my servant
[2:42:12] job I think let's read that in Job
[2:42:14] chapter one
[2:42:22] Job chapter
[2:42:32] one job chter 1
[2:42:35] ver we will come back to job as we
[2:42:38] finishing and the Lord said unto Satan
[2:42:41] hast thou considered my servant job that
[2:42:44] there is none like him in the the earth
[2:42:46] a perfect and an upright man one that
[2:42:48] fearth God andth
[2:43:08] evil before job went whatever it is that
[2:43:10] he went
[2:43:12] through God had a testimony concerning
[2:43:14] him
[2:43:16] I can say God knew
[2:43:18] him God knew his
[2:43:21] life and if you continue
[2:43:24] reading see that sat is given
[2:43:27] permission to go and do whatever he
[2:43:29] wants with
[2:43:30] him so did God know whatever Satan was
[2:43:33] going to
[2:43:35] do yes God
[2:43:38] knows because he knows
[2:43:40] everything and if I can go ahead of my
[2:43:42] sermon and tell you
[2:43:44] this when you realize that God knows you
[2:43:47] this
[2:43:49] way it changes the way you
[2:43:53] think it changes the way you do
[2:43:57] things it's very easy during
[2:43:59] preaching to keep on quoting and
[2:44:02] saying that names were written in the
[2:44:05] Lamb's Book of
[2:44:07] Life even before the foundation of
[2:44:10] the it's very easy to repeat that
[2:44:13] stat but get me a person who
[2:44:17] knows who really really
[2:44:20] knows that their name is in the
[2:44:23] book there is nothing that you can do
[2:44:25] that can move this
[2:44:29] man his thinking is
[2:44:32] different he knows I came from
[2:44:35] God and I go back to
[2:44:38] God because why was your name written in
[2:44:40] the
[2:44:42] of because God in his book it's a great
[2:44:47] book of
[2:44:49] redemption God was playing a
[2:44:52] drama and in the preview of the
[2:44:56] drama you know before they release a
[2:45:00] movie a movie can be three
[2:45:04] hours now the young people are looking
[2:45:06] at
[2:45:07] me know these things you watch those
[2:45:12] movies before a movie is released
[2:45:17] what comes
[2:45:19] before a trailer thank you thank you for
[2:45:22] the honest
[2:45:24] Brethren there's a
[2:45:27] trailer a
[2:45:31] preview so it is just a few
[2:45:35] sections of the
[2:45:39] movie that shown in
[2:45:43] advance to give you some
[2:45:46] sight of what the drama is going to be
[2:45:51] about so the preview that God
[2:45:55] gave was a
[2:45:57] book and this
[2:46:00] book he SLE a
[2:46:03] lamb and he dipped his finger in the in
[2:46:05] the blood of the
[2:46:08] lamb and he wrote the
[2:46:11] names in the
[2:46:13] book that was the end of the
[2:46:19] preview that was the end of the
[2:46:22] preview now here we are acting out the
[2:46:28] movie what is the movie all
[2:46:31] about the drama is in the
[2:46:34] book so when the preacher is
[2:46:37] coming God is the
[2:46:40] director using the
[2:46:42] preacher relay the film to you
[2:46:46] and when you're hearing the
[2:46:48] message what is
[2:46:50] happening names are being
[2:46:53] called when your name is
[2:46:55] called it is my
[2:46:57] time let me tell you
[2:46:59] now there are certain
[2:47:02] places and certain things that were not
[2:47:05] shown and these things were
[2:47:08] hidden that is the reason why you are
[2:47:11] coming to this
[2:47:13] world was through
[2:47:18] perverted you remember the wise
[2:47:21] men they came one
[2:47:24] way went back another
[2:47:28] way what am I trying to tell you these
[2:47:32] are previews concerning
[2:47:35] you we have a
[2:47:37] drama inside a
[2:47:40] drama and the people that
[2:47:42] know it has to take people
[2:47:46] that are
[2:47:47] thought receive the understanding that
[2:47:50] John was talking
[2:47:53] about can be able to get in the
[2:47:56] drama decod their
[2:47:59] positions because what is a
[2:48:01] drama one person can wear even up to 20
[2:48:09] masks one
[2:48:11] actor one actor and we are let by one we
[2:48:16] are led by
[2:48:18] one the
[2:48:20] producer the
[2:48:22] director said I'm not going to sit up in
[2:48:27] heaven when they shooting those
[2:48:30] films the director usually sits on a
[2:48:33] high
[2:48:35] chair he backs
[2:48:38] instructions by the
[2:48:40] director the producer of the
[2:48:43] film I'm not going to see in
[2:48:45] heaven and give
[2:48:48] instructions I am going to go
[2:48:51] down because one of those
[2:48:54] Mas
[2:48:55] involve a
[2:49:01] Dr one of those
[2:49:05] masks
[2:49:07] involve a
[2:49:09] prostitute one of those
[2:49:13] masks
[2:49:16] whatever sin you can
[2:49:18] mention all those are
[2:49:21] masks
[2:49:22] Jesus he came down I'm not going to stay
[2:49:26] up in
[2:49:27] heaven I am going to come
[2:49:30] down I am going to
[2:49:33] feel each and
[2:49:35] everything that the actors go
[2:49:40] through but this is the
[2:49:43] thing
[2:49:45] a
[2:49:46] drunkard he's an
[2:49:50] actor let me ask you
[2:49:52] something is a drunker really
[2:49:57] himself he's playing a
[2:50:01] part he's playing a part in God's Great
[2:50:07] drama we want to know so let us go back
[2:50:11] we are going to the mind of God
[2:50:13] now could not become a
[2:50:16] savior if there was no
[2:50:19] sin he could not become a
[2:50:22] Healer if there was no
[2:50:24] sickness there has to be low moments in
[2:50:27] your
[2:50:28] life so that he can be the one who lift
[2:50:31] you
[2:50:32] up I want you to
[2:50:35] understand I want you to
[2:50:37] know whatever you're going through in
[2:50:41] life that is not you
[2:50:51] I want you to look at your challenge
[2:50:53] now I want you to look at whatever has
[2:50:56] been oppressing
[2:50:58] you you've been a Believer all this
[2:51:02] time but you're not reaping the fruits
[2:51:04] of the
[2:51:05] message look at those things now now and
[2:51:10] tell them this is not me
[2:51:23] you've struggled with something for so
[2:51:27] long right now right after service speak
[2:51:31] to
[2:51:32] it this is not
[2:51:39] me speak to that
[2:51:41] issue speak to that challenge
[2:51:45] because we've started
[2:51:46] growing in the knowledge of Jesus
[2:51:49] Christ we've started
[2:51:52] knowing sometimes when these
[2:51:56] actors their roles for so
[2:52:01] long they sort of forget who they
[2:52:06] are but I thank
[2:52:08] God day after
[2:52:11] day names are being
[2:52:13] called brother Bram says you are
[2:52:17] hearing from your
[2:52:20] theop so what

[2:52:30] sister the part of a never failing
[2:52:33] person the part of a defeated
[2:52:36] Christian the part of a prayerless
[2:52:40] Christian but the
[2:52:42] director is holding the
[2:52:45] book and reminding
[2:52:47] you this is just God's Great
[2:52:52] drama if you feel lost if you feel
[2:52:56] lost this is what
[2:52:59] happens you know they acting on the
[2:53:03] stage and behind them is a
[2:53:06] cutting when you get so carried away in
[2:53:08] your

[2:53:47] curtain what is
[2:53:50] happening they
[2:53:52] you P the C of
[2:53:54] time is introducing
[2:53:59] yourself I know this will sound
[2:54:03] confusing when oh Hallelujah just allow
[2:54:06] me I'll read these quotations later
[2:54:08] they're all in the message when the
[2:54:10] message is going
[2:54:11] forth it his names being called
[2:54:16] and the names that are being

[2:54:39] this we need to
[2:54:42] know we need to know
[2:54:45] remember the
[2:54:46] story of that little
[2:54:49] boy that only had a small piece of
[2:54:52] mirror his father used to shave his
[2:54:55] beard and he had to struggle to see
[2:54:58] where the beards
[2:55:00] are and this one
[2:55:02] time they visited their auntie in the
[2:55:06] city and they happened to have a big
[2:55:10] mirror before he got to the
[2:55:13] Mirror of a perfect man before he could
[2:55:16] get to the top of the
[2:55:18] mirror he had to climb seven
[2:55:23] steps
[2:55:24] amen he had to climb seven
[2:55:27] steps while you coming to church you're
[2:55:30] climbing the seventh
[2:55:32] step from step
[2:55:35] one and as he's
[2:55:37] climbing maybe from the first
[2:55:40] step he could see the top of his
[2:55:43] head when you came to the
[2:55:46] message something in he was not agreeing
[2:55:48] with me and and
[2:55:51] preachers something and he was not
[2:55:52] agreeing with painted
[2:55:55] faces was not agreeing with wearing
[2:55:57] trousers for
[2:55:59] women you're climbing the step of
[2:56:02] Faith you could see a little
[2:56:05] portion and you climb another
[2:56:07] step you see another
[2:56:10] portion you CL
[2:56:12] again when you see your
[2:56:15] you don't start
[2:56:17] rejoicing the more you
[2:56:19] seeing the more you keep on
[2:56:22] going the more they went into the
[2:56:25] land the more they kept on
[2:56:28] fighting there was no
[2:56:30] rest the more they kept on
[2:56:33] going when you see what God has in store
[2:56:36] for

[2:56:40] today and God answers it don't stay
[2:56:43] there

[2:57:12] on and on until he got to the
[2:57:16] top when he got to the
[2:57:19] Top This was something
[2:57:23] strange yet so
[2:57:30] familiar does that sound something to

[3:02:07] word of
[3:02:09] God and that it was Eagle
[3:02:12] food then you left the other
[3:02:17] thing you have then been formed into the
[3:02:19] living image of the
[3:02:24] living you
[3:02:26] heard from your
[3:02:32] theop amen praise the Lord amen that is
[3:02:36] why coming to
[3:02:37] church if you take coming to church as
[3:02:39] an ordinary
[3:02:42] thing
[3:02:44] you what unto
[3:02:47] you
[3:02:51] the speaking to someone
[3:02:56] today praise the Lord amen so you see
[3:02:59] this
[3:03:00] here there's so many things I wanted to
[3:03:02] get to
[3:03:04] and I've not even scratched the
[3:03:08] surface but I trust we are knowing
[3:03:11] something we are getting to see our
[3:03:14] identity because since the sooner we see
[3:03:19] this the better it will be for
[3:03:22] us and we no longer going to live under
[3:03:24] privileged
[3:03:26] lives First Corinthians chapter 13 where
[3:03:29] we
[3:03:31] were we'll read verse
[3:03:42] 12
[3:04:01] 1 Corinthians 13:12 says
[3:04:06] this that we' read
[3:04:09] previously for now we see through a
[3:04:11] glass Darkly
[3:04:23] but then face to
[3:04:32] face now I know in
[3:04:36] part
[3:04:37] then shall I
[3:04:40] know even all even as all
[3:04:50] amen since I hope we see
[3:04:54] this there's a
[3:04:56] place where we are
[3:04:59] known and I want to bring it in this
[3:05:03] context Paul
[3:05:05] says that
[3:05:08] then
[3:05:10] then then like referring to a future
[3:05:15] time that
[3:05:17] then shall I
[3:05:19] know and I just want to tell you these
[3:05:23] things
[3:05:25] then is no longer there
[3:05:29] now but
[3:05:32] then is now
[3:05:35] now let me show you this you see the
[3:05:40] Devil is a master doing things
[3:05:46] brother Bram say
[3:05:49] somewhere that if you get to a
[3:05:52] place I think she'll been Church
[3:05:56] ages where the bride where the bride
[3:05:58] knows who she really
[3:06:00] is he actually says that
[3:06:03] Satan will be
[3:06:06] powerless before
[3:06:09] her now I'm just going to take it
[3:06:11] through a little bit so that we can
[3:06:12] catch these things
[3:06:16] and he
[3:06:17] says he
[3:06:18] knows that if the people get the true
[3:06:21] revelation of the true
[3:06:25] church and what she
[3:06:29] is now I want you to understand brother
[3:06:32] bram's
[3:06:34] words Paul as he was
[3:06:37] writing was referring to a
[3:06:42] future
[3:06:43] but brother Bram is
[3:06:46] saying revelation of the true church and
[3:06:48] what she will
[3:06:53] be no but the revelation of the true
[3:06:56] church and what she
[3:07:04] is what she will stand
[3:07:07] for no
[3:07:10] sir but what she stands for
[3:07:14] and that she will
[3:07:19] do but she can do right here right
[3:07:26] now that she can do the Greater
[3:07:32] Works once she knows
[3:07:35] that then she will be an invincible
[3:07:42] Army
[3:07:44] this is the
[3:07:45] Revelation that Satan has been
[3:07:48] fighting since time
[3:07:50] Memorial he doesn't want you to look
[3:07:52] past the curtain of
[3:07:54] time he wants to look at the you that is
[3:07:57] acting the
[3:08:00] drama he does not want you to hear your
[3:08:03] name when the director is reading the
[3:08:09] script because the preaching of the word
[3:08:13] it is names that are being
[3:08:16] called Satan does not want you doing
[3:08:19] that he wants to keep you in a
[3:08:23] place where you are looking for
[3:08:27] it instead of looking at
[3:08:30] it you're looking for something in the
[3:08:34] future not
[3:08:36] realizing that it is actually right here
[3:08:39] with
[3:08:40] you remember that little boy
[3:08:43] that had a small piece of
[3:08:45] stamp that was worth quar million
[3:08:48] dollars quar million
[3:08:51] was but he didn't
[3:08:53] know what
[3:08:55] happened in his
[3:08:57] mind when he had the
[3:09:00] stamp he could only think of an ice
[3:09:03] cream and the
[3:09:07] postman he I'm going to the
[3:09:10] postman get some 5 cents
[3:09:14] and with the five
[3:09:16] cents I'm going to get an ice
[3:09:19] cream but that that
[3:09:22] stamp was wor a lot
[3:09:26] more that is
[3:09:28] why that is why we are putting our
[3:09:31] childish
[3:09:33] thinking we are putting our childish
[3:09:35] understanding we are putting our
[3:09:37] childish
[3:09:39] speaking we are coming to church to be
[3:09:43] taught so that we can understand the
[3:09:47] value of the
[3:09:48] stamp that is in our
[3:09:51] hands because five cent
[3:09:56] mentality is not going to cut
[3:09:58] it because this little boy have the
[3:10:02] purchasing
[3:10:03] power to buy a whole ice cream
[3:10:07] store and buy other
[3:10:09] things and that is the power that is in
[3:10:13] the church
[3:10:14] today only she can
[3:10:17] know but the devil doesn't want you to
[3:10:20] know even this
[3:10:22] afternoon he doesn't want you to know
[3:10:26] but I want to repeat it
[3:10:27] again they that know their
[3:10:30] God they that know who they
[3:10:33] are they shall do
[3:10:38] exploits the devil wants you to keep on
[3:10:41] postponing
[3:10:43] you keep on
[3:10:45] postponing you know we looking for that
[3:10:47] super
[3:10:49] Church you and
[3:10:51] who I have already found
[3:10:54] it I have already found
[3:10:57] it is why I'm here
[3:11:00] sweating telling her that you need to
[3:11:04] know that you need to come up
[3:11:07] here you need to go to the
[3:11:09] angel and take the little book
[3:11:13] because in the book is your
[3:11:18] identity in the book is your
[3:11:23] name
[3:11:26] amen praise the Lord
[3:11:29] amen
[3:11:31] hallelujah
[3:11:34] amen so many things that we could get
[3:11:38] to but I just want to finish with
[3:11:41] this
[3:11:43] we've read about
[3:11:45] job a man that was loved by God so
[3:11:49] much a man that God spoke great things
[3:11:53] conc and you see he got to this
[3:11:58] place why he went through so
[3:12:00] much and he was always SE on the
[3:12:04] As and brother Bram says we are all on
[3:12:08] the
[3:12:09] aips we have our troubles
[3:12:13] our ups and
[3:12:15] downs our bad
[3:12:17] moments our
[3:12:20] sicknesses our
[3:12:22] heartaches and our
[3:12:25] disappointments but he
[3:12:27] says but then in the midst of all that
[3:12:32] trouble God came to his
[3:12:36] rescue job is seated in the
[3:12:39] asip the problem was not only his
[3:12:42] sickness
[3:12:45] he had boyss all
[3:12:47] over he had
[3:12:49] troubl he had
[3:12:51] heches his family was
[3:12:54] gone his wealth was
[3:12:56] gone and he was looking at
[3:12:59] creation and is
[3:13:01] wondering I know there is someone that
[3:13:03] brought me to this
[3:13:05] earth I just couldn't come here by
[3:13:08] myself I want Saints the moment you
[3:13:12] start asking this
[3:13:14] question know this time you're going to
[3:13:15] read it when you get back
[3:13:18] home you need to get to a place where
[3:13:20] you ask God questions for God to prove
[3:13:22] to you that you are his
[3:13:30] son Abraham was a father of many nations
[3:13:33] right but there came a time God spoke to
[3:13:37] Abraham look at the
[3:13:41] Sand generation is going to be comes to
[3:13:45] him again moves him from the
[3:13:48] dust to the
[3:13:50] stars look up to the
[3:13:52] Stars you're receiving this
[3:13:55] message that is moving you from the dust
[3:13:59] to the stars from the
[3:14:02] Earthly to the Heavenly from time to
[3:14:07] Eternity from the Earthly the
[3:14:11] terrestrial to
[3:14:13] celes but hearing these
[3:14:16] things is not
[3:14:18] enough Genesis
[3:14:21] 15:7 Abraham asks
[3:14:24] God how will I
[3:14:29] know
[3:14:32] God you said that you'll give me the
[3:14:34] Holy
[3:14:37] Ghost How Will I
[3:14:41] Know God you
[3:14:43] Sav I will lay hands on the
[3:14:46] sick and they shall
[3:14:48] recover
[3:14:51] how
[3:14:53] no God said that if I know who I
[3:14:58] am I become an invincible
[3:15:03] Army will I
[3:15:07] know that's right Saints just give me
[3:15:11] some few more minutes
[3:15:15] amen what does God do right
[3:15:18] there he enters into a covenant with
[3:15:24] Abraham you'll forgive
[3:15:26] me I wanted to rush to job so that I can
[3:15:31] finish but I've been asked to go back to
[3:15:36] Abraham so let me be
[3:15:38] obedient and I trust you'll also go with
[3:15:41] me
[3:15:46] amen so now Abraham has
[3:15:50] asked how will I
[3:15:52] know and
[3:15:54] God is a faithful God
[3:15:57] Saint so what happens
[3:15:59] here he says Lord
[3:16:02] God
[3:16:04] whereby shall I know that I shall
[3:16:07] inherit
[3:16:11] it
[3:16:13] How will I know God the promise of the
[3:16:17] Rapture the promise of a body
[3:16:20] change all these are great
[3:16:22] promises God your word is so
[3:16:25] sweet when I hear it something in my
[3:16:29] heart always says
[3:16:31] amen that God I want to move to a
[3:16:34] place of not just
[3:16:37] hearing but I have heard with my own
[3:16:40] ears and now I see
[3:16:43] and when you hear and you
[3:16:45] see now you can
[3:16:48] know and you're telling God all these
[3:16:51] things are
[3:16:52] good but I want to
[3:16:55] know and the Bible says and he said unto
[3:16:59] him Me 3 years old she T and pigon all
[3:17:03] those
[3:17:04] [Applause]
[3:17:08] things and at this
[3:17:10] point at this
[3:17:13] Point God was entering into a covenant
[3:17:15] with
[3:17:17] him and the Bible is very
[3:17:21] clear and brother Bram tells us that
[3:17:24] this
[3:17:25] Covenant was an unconditional
[3:17:31] Covenant a covenant between two
[3:17:34] people but
[3:17:36] Abraham all you need to
[3:17:39] do
[3:17:41] only be
[3:17:46] [Applause]
[3:17:47] [Music]
[3:17:49] praise God Amen and you wonder why the
[3:17:52] angel loved this
[3:17:55] song you wonder why the angel loved this
[3:17:59] song it reminds the angel of the
[3:18:04] Covenant and there's nothing as powerful
[3:18:06] as when a people that know their God and
[3:18:08] their Covenant remind God of their
[3:18:11] Covenant
[3:18:18] in his Fallen
[3:18:21] condition brother sister does not matter
[3:18:23] how far you've
[3:18:25] gone it does not matter how far the
[3:18:28] children have gone
[3:18:31] Wayward I'm against this teaching in the
[3:18:34] message I'm against this teaching in the
[3:18:37] message I'm against this teaching in the
[3:18:41] message
[3:18:43] that if your children go
[3:18:46] Wayward you leave them alone God will
[3:18:48] deal with
[3:18:50] them Pastor if I'm wrong you'll come and
[3:18:52] correct
[3:18:54] it say let me ask you why would God give
[3:18:58] you children to trouble
[3:19:04] you yeah fine we know we saved as
[3:19:06] individuals yes but why would God give
[3:19:08] you
[3:19:11] children
[3:19:14] do you know your
[3:19:15] God your God is Not That
[3:19:19] unfair the our God is Not That
[3:19:23] unfair and I'm challenging any parent
[3:19:28] today if your children have gone
[3:19:32] Wayward I want you to remind God of his
[3:19:37] Covenant this is why I said we need to
[3:19:40] put our childish thinking
[3:19:46] why would God give you children to
[3:19:48] trouble in your later
[3:19:53] years you can't sleep well at night
[3:19:55] because you're always wondering what of
[3:19:57] my children out of my
[3:20:01] children I just I'll just ask you one
[3:20:04] thing as you are bringing them
[3:20:07] up did you teach them the
[3:20:09] Bible Check Yes did you take them to
[3:20:12] Sunday
[3:20:13] school check yes did you take them to a
[3:20:16] Bible believing
[3:20:18] Church yes God I did my part to the best
[3:20:23] of my
[3:20:27] ability I apply the
[3:20:30] token I am not going to have
[3:20:34] children that are disturbing me
[3:20:36] heartaches day and
[3:20:38] night oh
[3:20:40] God God of
[3:20:43] sister intervene in my
[3:20:46] situation why you know your
[3:20:52] God while we struggle and get tossed up
[3:20:55] and
[3:20:59] about is because we do not know our
[3:21:03] God but look
[3:21:06] atun she didn't know much of the
[3:21:09] Bible she didn't know much of the
[3:21:11] message
[3:21:13] but she knew her
[3:21:14] God and when a person who knows their
[3:21:17] God goes down their
[3:21:20] knees the airport was busy that
[3:21:26] day flight to Switzerland flight to this
[3:21:29] place Europe to this
[3:21:31] place but there was an
[3:21:34] atiim that knew her God and when he got
[3:21:38] she
[3:21:39] got her prayers
[3:21:42] created a
[3:21:44] storm
[3:21:45] why she knew her
[3:21:50] God
[3:21:53] am so Abraham Abraham go bring
[3:21:58] this and what was God
[3:22:01] doing God was giving a
[3:22:05] preview of
[3:22:07] Calvary and he says this
[3:22:10] here notice this
[3:22:13] he told Abraham now he cost a deep sleep
[3:22:14] to come upon
[3:22:21] Abraham you haven't got nothing to do
[3:22:23] with
[3:22:27] this am going to do
[3:22:31] it that's the problem with young
[3:22:34] people you don't want to get into good
[3:22:37] sleep for God to give you
[3:22:40] wife
[3:22:43] sleeping means You Close Your
[3:22:47] Eyes Adam slept God gave him a
[3:22:51] wife Abraham
[3:22:53] slept God confirmed his
[3:22:56] Covenant now we see this
[3:22:58] here God was showing I want you to
[3:23:02] notice God was showing Abraham
[3:23:06] Calvary what he was going to confirm
[3:23:09] this
[3:23:10] Covenant
[3:23:13] between
[3:23:14] Abraham and Abraham's seed
[3:23:20] forever so I want you to understand
[3:23:23] that we go back to job and job says here
[3:23:28] he's in this place of
[3:23:30] disappointment and he's wondering I want
[3:23:32] you to have Calvary in mind now
[3:23:35] okay a place of
[3:23:38] disappointments his wife is telling him
[3:23:40] why don't you cast God
[3:23:44] he's looking at the
[3:23:45] tree if the tree goes
[3:23:48] down it leaves
[3:23:50] again when the flower goes down it comes
[3:23:53] up again but when a man goes to
[3:23:57] sleep when he dies the family just
[3:24:02] comes and They Mourn the death of the
[3:24:04] person and They Mourn the death of the
[3:24:08] person and they go away and he was
[3:24:13] wondering and he might be there
[3:24:16] wondering I'm having many
[3:24:19] challenges more
[3:24:21] now than even before I was a
[3:24:25] Christian more than before I came into
[3:24:27] the
[3:24:28] message we have more troubles when we
[3:24:30] become
[3:24:32] Christians and the Bible says that many
[3:24:35] is the afflictions of the
[3:24:38] righteous
[3:24:40] but the
[3:24:43] Lord delivers him from them
[3:24:46] all so I want you to look at your
[3:24:49] challenge I want you to look at your
[3:24:52] Affliction and see the promise of
[3:24:55] God yes he promised
[3:24:58] afflictions he promised strange
[3:25:01] things some that would even be beyond
[3:25:03] our
[3:25:05] understanding but they are always done
[3:25:07] for our
[3:25:09] good that is why you have someone like
[3:25:12] Paul has gone through so many
[3:25:15] things
[3:25:17] imprisoned he's been
[3:25:19] beaten he's been
[3:25:21] mocked
[3:25:25] Shipwrecked but he stands and
[3:25:27] say I am not
[3:25:30] ashamed I
[3:25:32] know whom I have
[3:25:34] believed he says we are troubled on
[3:25:36] every
[3:25:38] side but we are not
[3:25:40] distressed
[3:25:42] we are
[3:25:43] perplexed but we are not in
[3:25:46] despair we are
[3:25:48] persecuted but we are not
[3:25:50] forsaken we are cast down and we are not
[3:25:55] destroyed
[3:25:57] why Paul knew
[3:26:00] something Paul knew
[3:26:02] something and he was
[3:26:05] speaking according to the revelation of
[3:26:07] his
[3:26:10] faith so we see
[3:26:12] you will see if you could grasp that
[3:26:15] today that all our
[3:26:18] troubles that there is none of us that
[3:26:20] is immune from
[3:26:22] them if you realize if that they are for
[3:26:26] our own
[3:26:27] good our thinking will
[3:26:30] change it is to bring us to a
[3:26:34] place where God can make himself more
[3:26:38] real to
[3:26:40] us
[3:26:42] than when the trial
[3:26:45] come that thing that you going
[3:26:48] through that challenge that you
[3:26:51] facing that Temptation that you're going
[3:26:54] through it is to bring you to a
[3:26:57] place where God can make himself more
[3:27:00] real to
[3:27:04] you than he was before
[3:27:08] the that sickness that has been
[3:27:12] troubling you for so
[3:27:14] long it is
[3:27:16] there so that the glory of God can be
[3:27:20] seen we are knowing right amen we are
[3:27:24] knowing let us keep on knowing now
[3:27:27] because many of
[3:27:28] times challenges will
[3:27:31] come we praise the challenge instead of
[3:27:33] praising
[3:27:36] God but when we
[3:27:39] know our thinkings change
[3:27:42] and brother Bram will say this
[3:27:44] himself and I want to join in this
[3:27:46] morning with
[3:27:48] job to say that I've lived a long enough
[3:27:51] life to know that that is a
[3:27:55] truth that I've seen it in my own
[3:27:58] life he was there
[3:28:01] wondering how about my
[3:28:03] life and then God comes and visits
[3:28:06] him and he says and he see Satan tries
[3:28:10] to make us nervous upset
[3:28:14] us to get us to
[3:28:17] think why did this
[3:28:19] happen why couldn't I have been like
[3:28:21] this why couldn't I have been like
[3:28:23] brother so and so why couldn't I have
[3:28:26] been like sister
[3:28:27] so you are like
[3:28:30] that so that the glory of God can be
[3:28:34] seen I want you to start knowing these
[3:28:37] things you are peculiar in his sight you
[3:28:41] you are peculiar in his
[3:28:45] sight what does that
[3:28:47] mean even if you are the only person on
[3:28:51] Earth
[3:28:53] Jesus would have still left
[3:28:56] Heaven come down to die for
[3:28:59] you that is how precious you are to
[3:29:03] him and he knows he knows your
[3:29:09] trouble and he says
[3:29:12] but you
[3:29:13] see and all these
[3:29:15] things all of
[3:29:17] them he he got to a
[3:29:20] point where he
[3:29:22] saw this is job now God is speaking
[3:29:24] about
[3:29:25] job he saw the vision of
[3:29:29] Easter remember job as he's going
[3:29:33] through all these
[3:29:34] things God knows him
[3:29:37] right he got to a place where he even
[3:29:40] stood and
[3:29:41] Sav even if he slays
[3:29:44] me yet I will still serve
[3:29:48] him brother Bram gets to a point in
[3:29:51] life even if I serve God all this
[3:29:55] time and after all my
[3:29:58] life he sent me to
[3:30:01] hell I will go to hell praising the
[3:30:05] Lord why he knew
[3:30:09] something we want to catch this
[3:30:12] things what these people
[3:30:15] knew what Abraham
[3:30:17] knew after the calary
[3:30:21] experience in that message that on
[3:30:24] Calvary brother Bram says there has
[3:30:27] never been a day like
[3:30:30] Calvary and there never will be a day
[3:30:32] like
[3:30:33] Calvary there's something special about
[3:30:37] Calvary because at
[3:30:39] Calvary that is why you
[3:30:43] know hallelujah amen we sing a
[3:30:47] song that while he was on the
[3:30:51] cross I was on his
[3:30:55] [Applause]
[3:30:56] mind since I wish we had time we could
[3:30:58] have gone through all these
[3:31:01] things in that message brother Bram
[3:31:04] says you can be
[3:31:07] honest you can be
[3:31:09] just you have to forgive me brother if
[3:31:13] you can really get that place I I feel
[3:31:14] like these things are very
[3:31:16] important because if you do not know
[3:31:19] these
[3:31:20] things we will keep on beating around
[3:31:22] the
[3:31:23] bush
[3:31:25] 64 paragraph 64 on Calvary he broke the
[3:31:28] powers of
[3:31:29] Satan he broke he opened the prison
[3:31:31] doors of
[3:31:34] Hell to every man that was shut up in
[3:31:37] this
[3:31:38] earth in the prisons
[3:31:41] fearing that when he
[3:31:43] died what death will do to
[3:31:46] him on
[3:31:48] Calvary he opened those cell
[3:31:50] doors and he let every captive Go
[3:31:55] free that is what that is what Paul
[3:31:58] could
[3:32:00] say where is your
[3:32:04] sting where is your
[3:32:07] Victory Paul knew
[3:32:09] something
[3:32:11] because he said I want to know
[3:32:15] him and know him in the power of his
[3:32:19] resurrection you don't have to no longer
[3:32:22] be torn down by
[3:32:27] sin is there something you're struggling
[3:32:29] with
[3:32:31] today you don't have
[3:32:34] to I came all the way from Nairobi to
[3:32:37] tell
[3:32:38] you and my prayer and my hope is that
[3:32:40] you
[3:32:42] know you don't have
[3:32:49] to you don't have to no longer be Tor
[3:32:52] down by
[3:32:55] sin you don't have to no longer yield
[3:32:58] your members to
[3:33:02] sin drinking smoking gambling telling
[3:33:09] lies gossiping
[3:33:13] biting I do not know this the spirits
[3:33:15] that bother dvf but there are some
[3:33:21] here but I came to tell you that you
[3:33:23] don't have
[3:33:25] to you can be
[3:33:28] honest do you know you can be
[3:33:31] honest you can be
[3:33:34] just
[3:33:36] ight and
[3:33:38] Satan and Satan
[3:33:41] and
[3:33:42] Satan can do
[3:33:45] nothing
[3:33:47] Satan can do
[3:33:49] nothing do you
[3:33:52] know Satan can do
[3:33:55] nothing Satan can do nothing about
[3:33:59] it that is what Calvary should mean to
[3:34:02] you I'll not continue the rest but there
[3:34:04] are some other
[3:34:06] quotations and brother continues to
[3:34:09] say that that is what these people
[3:34:13] knew and that is the reason why someone
[3:34:15] like
[3:34:16] Abraham was looking for a
[3:34:18] city whose build and maker is
[3:34:21] gone that is why the
[3:34:24] elders the prophets were being buried in
[3:34:28] Israel because that is the
[3:34:33] resurrection I believe I preached this
[3:34:35] year some time
[3:34:37] back where I was asking you where was
[3:34:41] Moses
[3:34:42] buried the Bible tells us that nobody
[3:34:46] knows where he's
[3:34:47] buried but by Revelation I can tell you
[3:34:51] Moses had to have been buried in the
[3:34:52] promised
[3:34:54] land because that is the only
[3:34:57] way I could appear with
[3:35:00] Jesus in
[3:35:03] Transfiguration because
[3:35:05] rure to
[3:35:07] place in the Promised
[3:35:09] Land
[3:35:11] Elijah was taken up in the promised land
[3:35:16] that is
[3:35:17] whyless of whatever it is that you go
[3:35:21] through you need to be buried in
[3:35:25] Christ because that is the
[3:35:27] place where you find your
[3:35:31] identity and he says
[3:35:33] this then he must have seen the vision
[3:35:35] of
[3:35:36] Easter and that is when he
[3:35:39] cried I know
[3:35:41] oh my redeemer
[3:35:43] live I know that I shall see him and at
[3:35:49] the last
[3:35:50] days he will stand on the
[3:35:52] earth oh hallelujah hallelujah for I
[3:35:55] know my
[3:35:57] redeemer brother Bram asks what do you
[3:36:00] know
[3:36:01] job I know I
[3:36:05] iing what do you know
[3:36:07] brother I know my God
[3:36:12] heals all
[3:36:14] diseases I know my God
[3:36:19] forgives all
[3:36:21] iniquities I know my
[3:36:26] God what do you
[3:36:28] know as he stand on our
[3:36:31] feet what do you know this
[3:36:36] afternoon and he says
[3:36:38] this and if job by a vision could stand
[3:36:41] so firmly Upon A
[3:36:52] Promise how much more ought we to do
[3:36:56] after Christ has risen from the
[3:37:04] dead and send back the Holy Spirit as a
[3:37:06] seal of
[3:37:09] promise
[3:37:11] that we too shall
[3:37:15] leave you see they were all looking
[3:37:17] forward to this
[3:37:20] things by
[3:37:22] Vision it had not really
[3:37:25] happened but for
[3:37:27] us it has
[3:37:29] happened since there's nothing new I'm
[3:37:32] bringing to
[3:37:34] you this
[3:37:36] message is to bring you to a place where
[3:37:38] you know who you are
[3:37:43] that each and every that you go
[3:37:46] through Saints I hope you really really
[3:37:49] catch
[3:37:50] this each and everything that you go
[3:37:54] through is specially
[3:37:59] designed and it is for a
[3:38:02] purpose brother
[3:38:04] Bram went through a sudden Series in his
[3:38:08] life we all know that he had that
[3:38:10] nervous condition which was a stomach
[3:38:14] problem and he saw the Lord concerning
[3:38:17] it for so
[3:38:20] long and it really troubled him so
[3:38:23] much but it got through a certain place
[3:38:25] I won't get into the
[3:38:28] story but he got into a certain
[3:38:30] place where God led him through a series
[3:38:33] of
[3:38:34] events and God confirmed to
[3:38:38] him that actually I know of your
[3:38:42] trouble and your deliverance is about to
[3:38:46] come and you know what
[3:38:48] happened that
[3:38:50] time the song that we usually
[3:38:54] sing on the wings of a snow
[3:38:59] white it usually had two
[3:39:03] verses it only had two
[3:39:05] verses but after this
[3:39:08] experience brother Bram another
[3:39:11] verse and this is what he
[3:39:14] says though I have
[3:39:16] suffered in many
[3:39:18] ways I cried for
[3:39:21] healing both night and day but Faith was
[3:39:25] not
[3:39:27] forgotten by the father
[3:39:29] above he gave me his
[3:39:32] sign on the
[3:39:37] wings what am I trying to drive atten
[3:39:40] I want you to start looking at your
[3:39:43] life not from a physical point of
[3:39:47] view I want you to change your
[3:39:50] view remember the cloud that was
[3:39:53] photographed for quite some time brother
[3:39:57] Bram used to view it
[3:39:59] wrongly until the angel came to him and
[3:40:02] told him turn it to the
[3:40:04] right and when he turned the
[3:40:06] view he could not see the face of Jesus
[3:40:09] Christ
[3:40:11] you've been looking at your
[3:40:12] life and nothing seems to be going
[3:40:15] right you've been asking a lot of
[3:40:18] questions I just want you to do
[3:40:21] something change your point of
[3:40:23] view change your eyes
[3:40:26] now pick the eyes of
[3:40:29] God look at your life Through The Eyes
[3:40:31] Of
[3:40:32] God look at your life through
[3:40:35] his and you will
[3:40:37] realize you are a supernatural
[3:40:41] being going through a natural
[3:40:44] life and after this
[3:40:47] experience these are the words that
[3:40:49] brother Bram
[3:40:50] speaks dear
[3:40:52] God I thank you for these things
[3:40:55] father you gave no other
[3:40:59] sign you gave no other
[3:41:04] sign you gave the world a
[3:41:07] sign and you give me a
[3:41:11] sign this was something that was so
[3:41:16] personal L him to this point of I
[3:41:21] know and he says this and the next they
[3:41:24] sing that eagle
[3:41:27] flying there's a message coming forth
[3:41:30] now and I pray
[3:41:33] God that you will let the dve
[3:41:36] lead Grant it
[3:41:39] Lord it led me to a faith I never had
[3:41:45] [Music]
[3:41:51] before and listen to the next
[3:41:54] words a faith that he's never had
[3:41:59] before makes him say
[3:42:02] this I

[3:42:44] eagle you might have been living among

[3:43:14] before so he needed to stretch
[3:43:19] out and needed to exercise a little
[3:43:22] bit the muscles were cramped up a little
[3:43:28] bit it had not flown for so
[3:43:32] long your life of prayer has not been
[3:43:34] active for so

[3:44:52] off and you climb
[3:44:55] up and you climb to one level of
[3:44:59] justification that's good enough

[4:17:45] many has God spoken to
[4:17:48] today amen we thank God for that you
[4:17:51] know there's something I've
[4:17:53] seen last Sunday we had Pastor
[4:17:57] Jesse and the other Su I think it is me
[4:18:00] who
[4:18:02] ministered but from the from the
[4:18:04] beginning God has emphasized the
[4:18:05] inspiration he gave at the beginning of
[4:18:07] the
[4:18:11] year he said it will be another
[4:18:15] phase and it was going you know it was
[4:18:19] about that red SE
[4:18:23] Crossing and how when they were crossing
[4:18:25] the Red
[4:18:27] Sea they were entering into another
[4:18:29] phase of their
[4:18:32] Liv and at the Red
[4:18:35] Sea when they were
[4:18:37] crossing the Egyptians also came chasing
[4:18:40] after
[4:18:42] them and God now the pill of
[4:18:46] fire brother if you could give us that
[4:18:48] pill of fire
[4:18:50] again that pill of
[4:18:52] fire was always the Bible says he was
[4:18:54] always leading the children of
[4:18:58] Israel God was dressed or clothed within
[4:19:01] that pill of
[4:19:04] fire so we can say that the pill of Fire
[4:19:06] is
[4:19:08] God it is the same Pillar of Fire that
[4:19:10] made
[4:19:12] Paul how many remember that in the book
[4:19:15] of Acts the same P of fire met
[4:19:19] Paul and blinded his
[4:19:22] eyes and when Paul said who are
[4:19:25] you out of that a voice said I am
[4:19:31] Jesus and that is the simp pill of
[4:19:34] fire and God in the in in the in in the
[4:19:38] first
[4:19:40] Exodus he he was leading them with in
[4:19:43] the pill of
[4:19:44] fire giving them light by the
[4:19:48] night and in darkness and that same pill
[4:19:51] of
[4:19:52] fire now when the Egyptians were coming
[4:19:55] to to kill them from
[4:19:58] behind running after them that pill of
[4:20:01] fire
[4:20:02] moved from the front of the children of
[4:20:05] Israel to their back
[4:20:08] and the Bible would go on to
[4:20:10] say
[4:20:12] God looked at the
[4:20:16] Egyptians through that Pillar of
[4:20:19] Fire and just by looking at
[4:20:22] them their Childs began tearing
[4:20:26] apart they you know they began dying
[4:20:30] just by God looking at them through the
[4:20:32] pill of
[4:20:34] fire oh my God
[4:20:37] and all of them were
[4:20:39] destroyed and that pill of fire is right
[4:20:41] behind
[4:20:42] us hallelujah amen and the brother
[4:20:46] spoken about the same thing also spoke
[4:20:49] about the same thing
[4:20:52] also I never told them what I was
[4:20:55] preaching God has
[4:20:57] eyes seeing through the pill of
[4:21:02] fire there are two things in this
[4:21:05] picture there is this
[4:21:08] man called William
[4:21:10] Bram a prophet of
[4:21:12] God a preacher from
[4:21:15] America he died
[4:21:20] 1965 more than 50 years
[4:21:23] ago and his
[4:21:26] ministry was actually a
[4:21:29] worldwide
[4:21:32] Ministry and his ministry fulfilled
[4:21:34] Malachi 4: 5
[4:21:41] which the brother
[4:21:42] quoted and says behold I send you Elijah
[4:21:47] the brother Isaac if you could also put
[4:21:49] that online for our view online viewers
[4:21:51] as
[4:21:53] well and that man's
[4:21:58] ministry as Elijah had Elijah anointing
[4:22:02] upon
[4:22:04] him the anoint of
[4:22:07] Elijah does not come on a group of
[4:22:10] people it usually comes on one
[4:22:14] man it was elah the with
[4:22:17] it and Elish was the first
[4:22:20] one to have that
[4:22:24] anointed then John the Baptist was the
[4:22:28] second and now the third time we see the
[4:22:30] spirit of el coming upon
[4:22:33] another was in this man's Ministry
[4:22:38] and while he was you know because after
[4:22:41] the second world
[4:22:44] war his
[4:22:46] ministry introduc reintroduced the
[4:22:48] healing
[4:22:53] movement many people were
[4:22:55] opposing saying God cannot
[4:22:58] heal without a
[4:23:00] doctor but in William bram's
[4:23:03] Ministry we saw Divine he being
[4:23:09] restored forget about what you're seeing
[4:23:11] now on TVs and
[4:23:13] everything many of it is
[4:23:16] fake and some of it is
[4:23:18] true but that anointing was
[4:23:22] restored in the days of the ministry of
[4:23:24] this
[4:23:27] man follow me closely here because I
[4:23:31] know there are some who did not know
[4:23:32] what the brother was talking
[4:23:34] about and so his
[4:23:37] ministry also restore to
[4:23:41] us the
[4:23:43] teachings of the
[4:23:47] Bible the it Resto to us the true
[4:23:50] understanding of the
[4:23:53] Bible if you notice I'm saying
[4:23:58] restore restore does not mean to bring
[4:24:01] anything
[4:24:03] new it means to bring back what was
[4:24:06] already
[4:24:08] there so William bram's
[4:24:11] Ministry did not did not introduce a new
[4:24:15] religion but it
[4:24:19] restored the original
[4:24:22] teachings of the
[4:24:24] Bible which the
[4:24:27] churches and the
[4:24:29] religions took
[4:24:32] away I'll give you two or three
[4:24:35] examples
[4:24:36] water
[4:24:37] baptism it is supposed to be in much
[4:24:41] water in the name of our Lord Jesus
[4:24:45] Christ to
[4:24:51] ad and understand and
[4:24:53] believes
[4:24:55] but the religion remove and
[4:25:00] they with infant baptism and they
[4:25:03] replace
[4:25:05] it
[4:25:15] God instead of somebody to decide
[4:25:20] for they
[4:25:22] brought introduced Trinity baptism
[4:25:25] Father Son and the Holy Ghost
[4:25:28] but but when
[4:25:30] the he came and and
[4:25:34] kicked told him let us go back
[4:25:37] let us go back
[4:25:39] to go back the
[4:25:43] gopel to the of who
[4:25:48] understand name of the Lord
[4:25:50] Jesus and the whole
[4:25:54] world there is nobody who baptized in
[4:25:57] Apostolic
[4:25:58] baptism apart
[4:26:02] from those who believes in the message
[4:26:04] of this man why
[4:26:06] because his
[4:26:07] message that's why he say that's not
[4:26:09] different from because his it brings us
[4:26:13] back to the scriptures
[4:26:18] amen and
[4:26:20] he true understanding of
[4:26:23] God because they used to teach us there
