Lord, you saw me. You saw my brothers. You saw my sisters. You saw our weaknesses. You saw our troubles. You saw our desires. You saw how we couldn't make it alone. And Father, you left all the glory in heaven. And Lord, you came on Calvary and you died for us. Father, we want to thank you for the opportunity you have given us to be in your house. Oh Lord, we need you this morning. Father, many have gathered in this place. You said in your word that come unto me all year that labor and he have a laden. Father, you promise that you'll give us rest. Oh God, king of glory. We want to surrender our lives to you this morning. Father the men, father the women, father the ministers, father the song leader, father the the musicians, Lord, father our dear pastor and his family. Lord, we are such a feeble people. Lord, we are such a needy people. Oh God, as the prophet say that the body of Christ is the most sick body. Lord, you said in John chapter 15 that we oh God that we are branches and you are the vine and Lord you say that we can do nothing without you for sure Lord we are we're such a needy people that is why we have come in this sanctuary tonight father Lord this is not the social gathering father oh God I remember at a time Lord you gathered the children of Israel around Mount Siord Lord, and you told Moses that they should purify and cleanse themselves for your coming down. Father, this morning, may you cleanse us, Lord. May, oh God, if there is anything in our lives that may hinder you, oh God, from touching us, oh God, from receiving us, Father, may you forgive us, Lord. How we need you, Lord. The Bible say that your eyes are so holy that you cannot behold sin. And Lord, we want you to look at us. We want you to touch us. We want you to receive us. Father, if there is anything in our lives, in our families, in our pastor's life, in the ministers lives, Lord, this morning that might hinder you from visiting us. Father, may you look at us through the shed blood of Calvary. Father, where you shed your blood and said it is finished. Oh God, please cleanse us. May you accept a sacrifice of praise and worship. May you accept, Lord, everything that is going to be done in this service. May you lead the song leading. May you lead the preaching of your word. Father, we pray. Lord, I remember there was a brother one day. He was brought in your meetings. He was so weak that people had to force him down through the roof. Father, you touched him. Lord, I remember woman who had an issue of blood. She came in the service and she had faith that if only I could touch the hem of his coming. Father, even tonight this morning, I believe there is one who said, "If only I can touch him." Father, there was a widow of Zarafa. She was eating her last meal to die. But you're so merciful that you sent Elijah to pass her way. Lord, there are people here who are like that widow. They are having the last money. They're having the last hope. They're waiting for the God of Elijah to show up. Father, remember the blind Bmas. He was seated in that situation. But when you passed his way, Lord, the man who woke up blind, Lord. Oh God, the day or ended when he was seeing, Father, you met a dead young man on the gates of Oh God, when they were taking to bury him, Lord, when he met with their creator, Lord, you gave them back their life. Father, we want you to come and touch us. We pray for our brothers and sister who are on the way. Lord, may you fasten and quicken their feet. Lord, everybody that is going to be a part of this service, may we receive our portion. May you renew the backsliden, Lord. May you save the savable, Lord. May you heal the sick, Father. May you bless the outcasts, Lord. May you bind the broken hearts, Lord. May you help us, Lord. We need a help, Father. Bless us this day in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have prayed.

So I want to uh uh extend my thanks to all those who cared to you know send a text you know show me some love and uh those who visited and those who sent something to you know encourage me. I was just in my bed and you know feeling bad and then uh you know someone brought a drink and he said well I'll not mention names they said it's from brother so sometimes when you feel bad and you know um the pastor comes to encourage you you feel encouraged but many times we think the pastor does not need encouragement I'm so grateful to those that really encouraged me this week. Uh it's been a trying week for me and my body. I think I was not really sick. I just broke down because of the match work that I've been doing since last year and then you know my immunity went down. So then flu came in and cough and was very weak in the body. But even this morning I'm not yet 100%. I'm so thankful to the Lord. Who cares and certainly also my wife who has always been by my side too. I was telling the boys at home, you know, she was feeding me medicine like a baby. So I say God bless you to my wife. Amen. Also I wanted to mention sister is in jail. Um I have been made to know I was not able to I got to know last night. So I was not been able to follow up. Sister, how many know sister? Um, Sister Sumpta is a very faithful member here. Um, she participates in every church activity. And so we got to learn that um I think she works in a a financial institution. So I think she was duped by uh the conmen about 1 1.5 million sheets. I don't have the details directly from her yet. So, we are going to determine that today. The deacons will determine that today after the service and then we can be able to let you know if she needs if she needs us to bail her out in any way. Also, brother Joel traveled to Arua. He sent his greetings. I'm sure he's streaming the service. We have sister Maria from Yeah. over here. God bless you. That chair is yours. Since closed here, I'm sure you'll always be blessed. Um, also I I've been informed. I don't know whether it is true that Mr. Wander is here. Is that true? Oh, right over here. God bless you so much. Amen. I think the deacons must have missed you, but we we welcome you so much. Feel at home. The children have been fellowshipping here for a long time. Is brother Neville here? Can you sister shalom? Is she here? Oh, she's lift it up high. Those are her children. So we are happy to receive you my sister. God bless you so much. Thank you to for coming to fellowship with you. Shall we go to the Bibles? The book of Psalms chapter 34. Um, we're just going to I was supposed to preach this on Wednesday. I thank brother Martin who stood in for me. How many we are blessed? Thank you so much, brother. Those coming, I had a few names coming from the new names. God bless you. We we are so much happy to have you. So we are speaking on part two of what we shared on on Sunday. We're continuing with it. We spoke on vulnerable in his presence. Amen. Amen. We are reading the same scripture. Psalms 34:14. Depart from evil. I will read from 14 to 19. Depart from evil and do good. Seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are upon their cry. Open unto their cry. The face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and deliverth them out of their troubles. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of as a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliverth him out of them all. [Music] number.chech. [Music] Amen. May you may be seated. I'm requesting um as usual you please give me your undivided attention. If you have a phone, check it and make sure it is either off or in silence so that it doesn't interrupt the service. And um if you feel you will want to go out in 1 hour from now, it's better you go now. You ease yourself and come back so that we can walk together. Is that amen? So if you have a program, let's try to cut off those programs. I believe it's not a preacher going to speak to us, but the Lord going to speak to us. We ought to respect the presence of God. We have been taught in church order. the way we are supposed to conduct oursel in in in church uh you know you find people speaking to each other and you know they use WhatsApp in church you know they're texting in church those things are done in the denomination for us we don't do that here and there is also something I observed Um I've observed it for a while that usually after the service and the service is dismissed, there are people who stay in the church and they begin talking and fellowshipping and all that. And that's not right because this is a place of prayer. We have dedicated it for that purpose. So if you if the service is done and you want to talk to somebody else, we request that you please step out especially sometimes when it is raining. We find that people have stayed in here then it becomes like a market. That should never be you. If you want to talk, you just step out. There are those two rooms there. You can always have as much fellowship as you want. But in here, before the service, during the service, we expect people to either be here in the word singing, worshiping, praying or doing one of those. Also, you know, after the service, there are some young people who rush to these machines to come and practice or you are not even allowed if you're not um approved musician. You're supposed to get approval to get statement by that is serious and a serious note to the young But also you're not supposed to do it immediately after service. You know the musicians can stay there play softly so that we maintain. Sometimes after the service we have dismissed but there are people who want to stay and maybe pray a little longer. At times I've even noticed and I noticed that some sisters or brothers are in church and um they're just trying to maybe meditate or pray. A group of young people will be somewhere shouting. This person will fail to pray. It is bad. That should not happen. This is a house of prayer. I had to say that on Sunday morning so that all of us can hear that so we can ease the work of the deacons. Um also our sister, I'm not sure if they have written your name properly. Uh uh um can you lift up your hand if you God bless you. You're welcome. We happy to be with you. Amen. May the Lord bless you this. May the Lord bless you all. I just want to speak on vulnerable in his presence. We we looked at vulnerability on Sunday and we saw that it means being open about your feelings about your feelings or you you are open about your feelings or fears, your weaknesses. You do not hide them. You open yourself up to to the Lord about those weaknesses, feelings, and [Music] fears. Vulnerability means being weak. Accepting to be weak because you are weak. you know accepting you know that you're feeble, you are frail, you're not hiding it. Many times we we have a put on religion because of hypocrisy. That's the living of the Pharisees. You find that the the hypocrites they they they are not uh they're hiding their true identity and when they come to the Lord what they express is not truly what they are in in the inside. And that's why you find that many times people have dry eyed prayers, dry eyed worship, dry eyed praise. I do believe if you you you are sincere in your heart, you know you will you will show [Music] emotion, you will not even intend to show it. But if it is coming from your heart, You cannot hide it. It's just like someone I remember those days when we was just starting out our relationship with my wife. You know, you would um one time, you know, we're talking and I told her how much I loved her and the feeling was so real. that that experience was so tangible that it made me cry. And she said, "Dear, we were both on phone just about a month or three away from to our wedding. I could be wrong with the dates, but anyway." And you know, as as we were talking, she said, "Are you crying?" I said, "No, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. you know because I wanted to hide my frailty my my weakness and many of us are like that we want to hide our weakness we want to hide our fe our feelings we don't we we are not sure how the other party or the other person will treat us if they know we are weak and we we often do that to each other but if you are sincere in your relationship in the feeling. You will express it. Just like a a young man that I was, how I was able to express my feelings. It's not much. It's just love. But love would make someone cry a man. Can you imagine that? It is true. It is possible. Maybe it has made some of you cry. Simply because of love. How many have you ever cried because of that? Well, well, of course you you you are hiding it. You don't want your weakness to be known. But you see, you have to accept to be vulnerable when it comes to [Music] God. Many of us, we hide our vulnerability. You find that someone is in church and they're praying but you see the their words are many words but those words have not touched it. They cannot touch God. Many of our prayers go unanswered because we are not accepting vulnerability. We are hypocrite. We don't want to show our weakness. You see, God is not in interested in your strength. Listen to this. God is even not interested in your perfection. God is not looking for a perfect person, a perfect woman, a man. God is interested in a weak woman, a weak man. God is interested in someone who can show their frame. That is what he calls a broken heart. That's what he calls a contrite spirit. Many times we think that God will accept us because we we have done everything perfect because we have lived right because we have you know you know when you come to pray and then the devil brings you to your remembrance everything that you did that was bad. Then you hold back your prayer. You be like the Lord can see that I am a sinner. And then you feel like you can't even pray. Some even fail or fear to come to church because of their sin. Why? Because they don't they want to hide their weakness. But let me tell you, the best time for you to experience the presence of God is when you are weak. When you you feel weak, when you you have a lot of fear, that is the right moment for you to experience his presence. Then come and when you come, don't even pay attention to the other voices you are hearing. God is interested in your weak situation. God is interested in your in your feeance. He is interested in your failures, in your fears. He has interest in your small things. When you come break down in your heart, that means you have a broken heart. That means you have a contrite spirit. Don't come here and try to pretend. You see that is a Pharisee. You see, he says a Pharisee. What does he do? He says when we pray, we should not pray like the Pharisees. They go to the tabernacle to the temple. They lift up holy hands. Begin repeating words. Oh Lord, you are powerful. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh, you're wonderful. is that prayer that doesn't move God. When you come before God, you have to first of all accept your frailty, your weakness, your fee. You have to express it. If you hide it, you will not be accepted. But if you express it, God will be interested in you. because he's a helper to those who are helpless. Amen. He's a strength. Amen. He understands when nobody understands. We should never hide our heart from our savior. He's the savior of our souls. You know, we have a song which says he's a savior of my soul. When you come to him, the Bible says when you come to him, you must believe that he is and he is a rewarder for all those that diligently seek him. So when you come, understand that have that mentality and then be ready to tell him how weak you are, how bad you are, our sin, then he will embrace it. Amen. Amen. Imagine that prodigal son if he had come back to his father. Amen. And you know maybe he had borrowed some clothes and a heart. Of course, you know, he was eating with a pig. But now out of that situation, you know, he would maybe say, "Let me go check on my dad." And then borrow a suit and borrow a cake and then go to his father and tell him, "Daddy, how are you doing? I just came to check on you. You know, you gave me my portion and I'm doing well, daddy. But I just came to check on you. What do you think would have happened?" his father would have ignored him because he would he would know that is a rascal. He he he's doing well. He says he's doing well. It's all right. If he's doing well, it's all right. And then he would have concentrated on the other sons. But when this boy came even in [Music] rats from feeding pigs and he came before the father he never hid his situation. He came the way he was. He told him, "Father, I don't even want to call you father. I am unworthy because of the kind of life I have been. I am a sinner. I am unworthy to be called your son. At least receive me as your servant." But when the father saw, when he saw brokenness, when he saw the vulnerability in this boy's life, he said, "I can never receive you as a servant. My blood is flowing through your veins." Amen. And he shouted, he said, "Help people. Kill the fat." Amen. and bring me a robe. Bring me a ring and for my son. Let us have a party. Amen. Amen. He would give him a new garment. He give him a new ring. He will receive him and hug him. That is our heavenly father. The Bible say he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities. He did not come for the perfect. He came for the sinners. He did not come for the for the know it all. He came for the weak ones. Actually in in the New Testament. He says that he left the wise and the prudent of the world and he came for the foolish the fe the small things of the world such as can learn. Amen. Amen. I'm willing to learn. And brother in the message questions and answers and I read this last Sunday. He says, "Wouldn't you all like to have a real Bible church, a real Bible church where all the spiritual gifts are set in order, everything making manifest just exactly the way it should be." And he says, "Wouldn't that be wonderful?" Now, you are going to have a sacrifice. You have to have a sacrifice to have a real Bible church. Is that amen? And he says the sacrifice is not money. Money has its place. It's not money that makes a real Bible church. What are you going to sacrifice? He says some of your ideas. And he says you are going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer. You are going to have to sacrifice maybe that stubborn will. Some of you are have stubborn wills. When God talks to you, you just say even if God said this but the moment you say but it means you have your own will. We must never have a but after saying the word. You can never say God says this but a believer should never have that in their mouth. You just say God says that And that settles it for me. I believe it. Amen. And so we see here many of us have a stubborn will. He says, but he says you have to sacrifice your stubborn will. And then you break down in humility. You see the whole Christian move is sacrificial. He that will follow me, let him deny himself, let him take up his cross and follow me daily. Each of us have our own cross to carry. And our cross is not the same. The weight is not the same because our strength is not the same or rather should I say our weakness is not the same. So then each of us have our own crossing. But then he said if you want to follow him first deny yourself. Second carry your cross. Follow him. How often do you have to sacrifice? Every day. We have to sacrifice every day. Paul said he died daily. May we also come to that place where we have to sacrifice our stubborn will except to break down in humility and we sacrifice some time in prayer. I quite frankly I believe that after this um subject those who have been listening like following it very well God will do something for you. So we see that um many people are stubborn and on Sunday we spoke about Saul how Saul was very stubborn. God spoke to Saul many times, but Saul many times disobeyed God. He never listened to what God said. He had his opinion. When you come to God, are you hearing me? When you come to God, you have no opinion. Tell your neighbor, your opinion doesn't matter. God is not looking for your opinion. God is looking for his word. God is looking for your faith in what he has said because he has not brought his word to debate with you. He has brought his word to make his word accomplish the purpose. So if God said in his word he's coming back for a church that is perfect without spot without wrinkle and I believe I'm that I believe I must be without spot I must be without wrinkle no matter what I see around me I am going to die daily I'm going to carry my cross daily I'm going to deny myself daily until I become what Now that is faith and you can't do that without being vulnerable. Every day you are going to realize you are vulnerable because whenever you see what God said about you, you don't see it in you. So then you become vulnerable. Then you cry. All great men were vulnerable. They always saw weakness. They always saw you know um fee. But you see God so strength, God so power. Let the weak say that's how it has to be done. How can it be if we are so self-centered, self-righteous and you know you cannot break down in his word and you are hiding your true identity from God. Brethren, we should stop having religion and we should be Christian. Religion will hide identity. Religion will be selfrighteous. But true Christianity will be feeble and weak and they will be reliant on God. Many times you want to show it as if believers are perfect people. Now I'm I'm sorry if I step on some toys, but I want to tell you all of you who are hearing me, you are not perfect. In that sense, we are all weak. So if an unbeliever comes in looking for uh Christians, he was told Christians are people who are changed and perfect without spirit, without he comes among you. If you do not accept vulnerability, that man or woman will be offended. They will walk away. They will say after all, they are sinners also. That's why they say touch people. Oh, they are the worst ones. Do you know why? Let me tell you something. We are not perfect, but we are not better than them. There is something I'm trying to preach. We are not better than other people who are in the world meaning that the things they are going through. We are going through the weaknesses they have. We have the failures they go through. We go through the temptations they have. We have. So if they come to us, if they come to you, do not try to show them that you are a super human being. There is no super human being. All human beings are the same. Muslim, Catholic, Anglican, they are all the same. Same And when they die, they all die and they all buried in the soul. And even if you refuse to cry, you also feel the pain the other unbelievers feel. That's why when Lazarus died, Jesus did not pretend. Like some believers who pretend me not cry because I'm a believer. Jesus did not pretend. He weptus the one we worship he did not pretend because he was a human being like now but the difference between us and them is that they accept their weakness. They know their weakness but they don't know a savior. Hallelujah. So when they have problem, they cry to one another and then they bewitch one another. You know, I have a problem in my marriage. Oh, don't worry. Don't worry, my friend. Don't worry, my friend. And then I'll take it to a this one who is helping them will be her. They wish one another. They betray one another. Don't tell me. Don't tell them who told you. See, you think they happen problems. I know everything. But don't don't say. And then when they go back, my friend, I'm always there for you. They trust in each other. The more they trust each other, the more they betray each other. That's why when you hear people speaking things like human beings are beasts. It is because they have been disappointed before by another human being. They trusted in human beings. You hear them speak all sorts of things about people. To me I don't trust people. people these people that's all true but that talk should be in the world because for them they have no savior when they have problem they run to each other they run to which doctor they run to doctors they run to psychiatrist they run to this and that but Christian true message believers when we are vulnerable hallelujah I said hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have a savior. We have a savior. And one who truly understand because he has experienced we have experienced. [Applause] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. The Bible say in all manner of temptations we go through he has gone through. And when I tell you that Jesus understands, believe me. Amen. That's why when you have a problem, when you have a weakness or if you have a sin that easily be saved, brethren, let me tell you, let us always run to the savior because he always understand. He knows what you're going through. He knows your weakness. He knows your suffering. He knows your pain. He understands your heart. He has gone through it before and is the savior of our soul. You do well to trust him. So when they come to us, let us be truthful. Let us tell them, look, I'm as weak as you, but I have something you don't like. I have a savior. One who keeps me when the whole world is breaking apart. One who holds me when I have no hope. One who encourages me. When I've lost everything. Amen. When I've had a heartbreak, he comforts my soul. Amen. Music can try but he cannot do it. My friend can try but he can't do it. But heus Christ. Amen. He comforts my soul. He restoreth my soul. Amen. That's what a savior is. But the issue is many believers are hypocrites. They do not accept to be vowed before the Lord. You see, you find that we are not sincere. Saul was not vulnerable. He offered the offerings he was not allowed to do that. But what happened? He did it anyhow. And when the priest came when he did not give, you know, like care that much, he said, "I did it because people were going away." And and you know, he was rebuked and God took away the kingdom. God took away the kingdom. Can you imagine? We talked about that on Sunday. But then let's move on. You see, when God took away the kingdom, he gives it to another man. Now listen close. He doesn't give the kingdom to another angel. He gave it to another. What's the difference between this other man and this 1 Samuel 13:40? But now the kingdom shall not continue. The Lord assought him a man. Now here is the difference. The Lord ass his own heart. So the difference was that this man had a heart like that of God. So he had a different heart. Oh, David was called a man after God's own heart because he was passed. Hallelujah. But because he always always was vulnerable and honest before God. So when he came to God, he told God what he truly felt. You know, he did things worse than what Saul did. Saul only exercised authority here and there. He was only a proud man. The biggest sin Saul had was pride. And the Bible says pride comes before the fall. But we see David had multiple sins. He was an adulterer, a lustful man. He was a murderer. A murderer. But God says he's a man after man. Is there last murder and immorality in God? No, he did not. God doesn't. So what's the difference? Why is David a man after God's heart? Because no matter his weakness, he always was vulnerable. He accepted. He never hid from the presence of God. He came to God and he expressed how he was. When he sinned, he came to God to you. To you only have I sinned. Wash me. P me with Let me tell you, David came to God openhearted, a broken heart, that is a heart like unto but pride is a heart of Satan. But brokenness, humility is a heart like unto the Lord. This man will I look, a man who has a a broken heart and a contrite spirit, a teachable spirit. Sometimes you correct somebody they pull their nose and they walk away that kind of heart God can never accept. Sometimes you can even preach the word a preacher you can see we have visitors here sometimes and you know you know the people and the word will be preached and you'll be like ah sister so and so brother so and so I'm sure this is his son but you turn look at him as a pastor like they have missed it and yet they were in the service. What happened? What went wrong? They have a hard heart. They don't want to be corrected. Instead of say, "Oh, God is speaking about they are the ones who say pastor must have told this. I think this church has even the preacher talked about my case and I had told it to only one person." Come on. Come on. Do we believe in God? Let me tell you, God speaks. When God speaks, always receive it. Whether it is coming from inspiration, let me tell you, you can even tell me about your case. And I know what you're going through. as an individual. You have told me as your person, I will never talk about it here. But if the Lord inspires me, I can come and bless. I'm blessed you about it. And like pastor, I told him my case for him to bless me. Not because I wanted that was inspiration for that moment, for that moment. Always have a broken heart. Don't be hard-hearted. Have a contrite spirit. Always be ready and willing to hear from God. Am I preaching to someone this morning? Amen. Have a vulnerable uh heart. Be vulnerable in his presence. In many psalms, David expressed fear, failure, guilt, long a longing. He hide, he hided or he hid nothing from God. Now on Sunday, I read you the story of of of brother Brham on uh on how God broke him. I said if you refuse to to break, God can break you. If he speaks to you and you refuse to break, he can allow things to come and break you. And and here is another portion of his testimony. To those of you who love stories, you can take a minute or two to listen to this one. I notice children love stories. You can preach for two hours and they will only remember the story. Praise God. Anyways, listen to this little story. that I could see my wife going, but I couldn't see that baby going. You know, he had seen that his wife would die, but it never occurred to him that even his baby would die. So, I just couldn't do it. And I said, "Oh, God, why did you take that precious little thing from me?" Something has happened to you and you asking God, "Why? Why? What is breaking you? Here I am. And God only breaks those who he is interested in. If you have a purpose to hit and you are proud, God can allow things to come and they will break you. So you see here he says he's crying to God. born. Why did you take that precious little thing for me? Here I am left alone in the world. Me and the boy to wander around together. I said why did you take her Lord? I got so worked up till I said Sherry honey that is coming to you this this morning. And he's talking to Sharon little Sharon who had died. and saying that is coming to you. Brother, what are you trying to do? Let us find out. I pulled off my rubber glove. Brother Brham was a man who worked on electricity poles. That was his profession. And so he he is now on the on the pole up there and he pulls off the glove the rubber glove after saying sh honey daddy is coming to you this morning is a broken man and he pulls off the glove there 2300 running right by me. It will break every bone in your body. I had gone crazy. I pulled my glove. I said, "Sh, I can't stay away from you anymore." I said, "Go. I had to be a coward. But I can't stand it. My heart is breaking." That's where God wants you. And the word this morning can bring you in that state. But if you it doesn't God has a purpose for your life. Situations will bring you just listen to the word. I let the word break my heart is breaking. I can't stand it. The next thing I knew, of course, he just went and the next thing he knew, I was sitting on the ground. [Laughter] How did he fall down? Sitting on the ground. How I ever got down from there? God only. I believe. I believe. This is my belief. Let me tell you what I believe. By inspiration. I believe God must have dispassed an angel. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Come on. Go down. This is a prophet to the church. He must not die now. Carry him and take him to the ground. And the angel must have gone with sleep. And then he woke up. How' they get here? He didn't say even power had shocked him. Now The same angel that was in that burning bush must have gone at a place. There might have been many times when you have wanted to die. Why are you not dead? Because there is a purpose in you. God is not done with you yet. You wanted to die because you were broken. God wanted you broken. to prepare you for your next phase. Many times we are all broken because God wants to use us because God wants to say, "See a man, see a woman, my owner." And brother Bam, the angel put him down. He only realized when he was done. And I believe now he also says what he believed. He said, "I believe if that gift hadn't been for ordained and put in there, I would have been gone right there cuz I made up my mind. I was going to take my life in a suicide case. I remember one time when we had just moved here uh when we were just about to move. Sorry. I was looking for a house. And I was driving I was in my first car. So I was driving the other side. It's a good nice you know Highlander having good ground clearance meaning like it was a little high. So so and it was new good tires. So that I don't know if that is what helped me. But here is what happened. I was driving, my glasses were up, window glasses and then all of a sudden I heard people shouting and the moment they started shouting. I I started dancing and I was driving. So I was wondering where am I dancing? Why am I dancing? So as I drove I said let me stop and see where they are. When I went back, I saw a threephase line on the floor on the road. I just drove over it. That's why I was dancing. It was the effect of electricity. I said I should have died. The devil wanted to finish me right there. But the angel of the Lord was He was right there. My work was not done. You cannot die. Until your work is done until your assignment done. I speak to you. The name of the Lord is all of you under the sound of my voice. You cannot die. God's purpose is God has an assignment for you. work for you to do. Amen. You can fasten that work by breaking down in his presence and being vulnerable. And he says, I believe if that gift will not was not ordained and put in there, I have been gone right there because I made up my mind. I was going to take my life as a suicide case. I'd lost my mind. I've had gone crazy. I went home. I said, "Oh, I put my tools in the car. I said, I'm going home. I've gone crazy." Sometimes God wants you to get to that time when you feel you're losing your mind. When our back was against the wall, and you feel as if it's all then he makes a way. Amen. Hallelujah. Why does he watch until things become ugly? Because he wants to come in when you have broken when you you are vulnerable. Let me show you after that what happened in life in the beginning of Jesus's fame. That is the message in 1953. I want to show you when you are broken then you will always submit to his word. So I want you to see it's just a small portion here that I want. And in the book probably some of you read of that night when the maniac ran to the platform out there in Oregon. He was going to take my life. Friends, this is brother William Marion brother. The same one who gave his testimony how he wanted to commit suicide. Actually, at another time when he was younger, he he tried to shoot himself because God did not allow him to be like the rest of the of the boys. Whenever he's trying to get a girlfriend or to smoke, a voice speaks. He hears a wall of we and he was wondering, why does God not allow me to be like my badies? I enjoy life. So then one time he's just all confused and he doesn't want, you know, he goes down with his hunting rifle and said, "Let me kill myself." So he took the gun and you know, uh, you know, pulled the trigger on his head and the bullet did not come out. He was so disappointed. He threw it away. And the moment he threw it out, the blood came out. So he couldn't kill himself. Second time he wants to kill himself on live. Can you imagine? This is a man supposed to be the prophet of our generation. He wants to commit suicide. If I come to you and I give you a testimony, said brethren, the whole of this week, I was having suicide thoughts. How many of you would have confidence in me as your brother Baka? Would you trust? Brother is shaking his head. suicide case. But yet here is a prophet of a generation contemplating murder, suicide twice, it needn't work out. Someone said now here after he has gone through those phases of his life, God has brought him down. God has assured him, you are going to do my job whether you want or not. You are going to preach the gospel. You're going to heal the sick. You're going to trouble the world whether you want or not. And if you don't want, you will face it. And if you try to kill yourself, you can't even die. If you try to drown, water will spit you. If you try to shoot yourself, I will stop the bullet. If you try to tell power to to to shock you, I will send the angel to pull you away. You cannot die until you submit yourself to become vulnerable in my presence for you to be used by me. William Ram, you must be a man after my heart because you are the one I've chosen for when God is interested in you. You don't know what what is happening. Sometimes you see you you see people but a man of God is not just a person. A servant of God is not just a human being. I wish I could continue on that line. I will show you many examples. You go and check any so-called man of God. God truth. You will see that their life is not normal. God guards them jealously. God protects them. They cannot die. And I will tell you something. Every child of God is a servant of God. We are all peculiar. Yes, sir. If the world thinks they can play around with you, they are wasting their time. Here is a man after brother Bam is trained and brother stands on the pulpit now to do the will of God. And then here is this man, a maniac. He had been known for years. Everybody feared him. So he went to go. He told Brother Bam, "I'll pull you from that pullpit. I'll break every bone in your brother Bam remain on the A very humble man." The de said, "No, no. Leave him alone. I'm doing God's will. Let him come and break everyone in my body." So the man came. Brethren here is a man who tried to kill himself. He couldn't succeed. Now you think a man can kill you. The devil is a joker. Ah, the devil is a joker. Oh, brethren, give the brother good microphone. This one is not working now. You see, listen, listen, brother, you don't worry about the microphone. Come, if you want, I can give you mine. Listen, the devil is a joker. He thought he can actually kill this man. Brethren was a think about it together. This is a man who tried to kill you and he failed. Do you think the devil could now kill him? I will fear no evil. The Lord is my shepherd. Here is a man. In other words, is saying if I couldn't kill myself, then nothing can kill me but God. So here when came someone asked him brotherham was you scared he said no sir not a bit as long as Jesus is there as long as he told me to do this and I am in his will there is nothing to fear as long as you are doing what he says do and and and you know you are directly led well then there is nothing to fear. Perfect love casts out all fear. There is no fear in God. Love takes away fear. That is a man who knows that he knows and he knows that God is real. And that was not pride. I see the same thing in David. And that was not pride. Is the same thing is the knowing that God is real and you are fully submitted to him. You're fully vulnerable to him. Can I now say this? If you're vulnerable in his presence, there is nothing can finish you before your time. Amen. Yes sir. When a man kneels before God, no demon can amen be able to destroy. If you kneel before God, no temptation can destroy. If you kneel before God, no heartbreak can break. Your ship may be wrecked, but you cannot be wrecked. As long as you're vulnerable in the presence of God. Amen. Amen. Letting off the pressure. Brother says something here very interesting. He says and you know and then the nervous neurotic age that we are living in. You know, in all of this, the doctors don't have the answer. Tell your neighbors, doctors don't have the answer. Dr. Money doesn't have the answer. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. You know, in all of this, because the dog doesn't have the answers because they themselves are also plagued with it. They don't have the answer. They don't know what to do. You say, "Oh, doctor, I'm just about to blow my head. I don't know what to do." As well, he would say, "I am too. It's a neurotic age. Let me tell you, I meet people in my office here and I'm telling you our generation is losing it. People are crazy. Maybe because of poverty. But I want to say because of demon people losing it. People are getting crazy. They're losing their mind. I wish H I wish I could be able to give you stories but I can't but I'm telling you people are losing their mind. Doctors don't have answers. Well, he would say I am too. Well, there is nothing you can do. He will give you a tranquilizer. Well, that wears us off. You are more nervous than you was in the first place. [Music] Exactly. And then you get better after the pain gets bigger. Our generation is a generation you are finding young children taking sleeping medication. Listen listen good. If you are here and you are below 40 50 years and you are drinking sleeping medication you need what I'm giving you this morning. You need spiritual help. It's not normal. The Bible say God gives his beloved sleep. When it is when it is night, you must be able to sleep well. But you find young people can't sleep. They are on phone. They're working at night. Oh god. on our generation. What is it? It's a end time plague. It's plaguing our generation. But the Bible says it's a nervous neurotic and you you don't have sleep at night. What? You need help but you you don't want to ask for it. You are covering it up. How I am fine. Are you really fine? You're not. You need help. You see, you go and doctor will give you a trunk like a sleeping m as soon as it wears off. You are more nervous than you was. Like a drunk man taking an extra drink to get over his drunk. You can do it. There is no answer. They don't have the answer. But God has the answer. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. God has the answer. Oh, do you believe it, church? God has the answer. That is what we want to take. Talk about to have the answer. God has got the answer. Oh, he has the answer. He has said it four times. God has the answer. God has got the answer. Talk about the answer. He has the answer. God has the answer. He has the answer because he is the answer. Amen. Hallelujah. Christ is the answer to every problem we are. Witchcraft is not the answer. Doctors are not the answer. You know, you know, psychiatric and all this psychology is not the answer. But let me tell you, Christ is the answer. Jesus is the answer. Amen. To every problem we have. Now, we are going to talk about him now. So, we see God chose to use brother. He was a poor he had a poor background as we saw. He tried to commit suicide two times. He was not perfect. He suffered things until it broke him and made him to learn to trust God. God has all the answers. He was a man that truly became vulnerable before the president. In the same way God chose to use David, there was a man who really was vulnerable before the Lord. He opened his heart before the Lord situation. May God help us to accept God as the solution. If you look at Hannah in the Bible, Hannah prayed through her pain. Hannah was deeply distressed because she didn't have children. Instead of pretending to be okay, she went to the temple and she poured out a salt. Her vulnerability touched God and God answered. 1 Samuel 1 15 says, "And Hannah answered and said, "No, my Lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit." If you're a woman like that, You are in good company. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drinks, but I have powered out my soul before the Lord. That is vulnerability. She went before the Lord and powered out her soul. Sister, if you have a sorrowful spirit, please don't hold it in. No, don't. You don't even not need to talk to me. Go before the Lord. Empower your soul in vulnerability before him. This is what Hannah did. And God answered right there. Because Hannah was vulnerable in his presence, Job was wrestling with his suffering. He lost everything and he didn't even hold back, you know, his pain and his questions. You go and read the book of Job. Job questioned God until you would think Job. He never kept quiet. He brought he never held back his pain or his questions. He said things many wouldn't dare say today. But instead of God rejecting him, God commanded Job for being real. He said, "Though he slay me, yet I will trust in him, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul." This is what he said. That's why when prophet Elu came. The first person he rebuked was Job for ting up himself and and making himself feel like as if he he was so better than how God judged him. But he was just bitter. Job Job was having a hest struggle. But you see that took him into a deeper revelation of who God is. He said one time even though the skin worms destroy my body yet you know he spoke by revelation with my eyes I will wash I will see I will see as he is he he had a revelation Peter was weeping after denying Jesus And after he denied Jesus three times, the Bible says Peter remembered the word of Jesus and he went out and wept. His tears were for a moment, but that moment of vulnerability and repentance, Jesus later restored him in love. But friends, I want you to see I want you to look at Peter on one side and see Judas on the other. Judas on the other side never accepted his sin. His heart was never broken. He was another kind. Judas betrayed Jesus. Peter betrayed Jesus. Same sin. But I want you to see the natures of the heart. The heart of of of Peter was so broken. When Jesus said those words, he remembered when before cross he remembered when he remembered. He didn't say the milk is spilled. So what can I do now? After all, he also said it. So he knew I would do it. So he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy. That's not a heart of God. They look at the heart. A man with a God heart. The Bible says he broke down and he wept. You see, but Judas when he knew what he had done, he never he even had a flesh. He was like, "What? You mean have killed him?" At some point, actually, I believe that Judas was a real real hypocrite. But I believe her an unbelief. Of course, but a believer. You see how confusing it is? He followed Jesus. Jesus Jesus humanly Jesus trusted him. He gave him the bag. This is a man who went to the to these people. He had seen what Jesus can do. He knows he can turn water into he can disappear when they catch him. So he knew his master Jesus will do a trick and disappear. So he said the way I'm counting this mathematics I can take this money for building the kingdom of God and then I go and kiss him and betray him. But at the same time when they catch him he will disappear. And I remain with the money and Jesus has disappeared and the kingdom of God will flourish. Those are done by unbelievers. Believers never betray Jesus at any time. Amen. Don't betray him at the school. They invite you at the bar. Tell them I cannot come. I am a believer. So let me go at the bar. They would drink alcohol. I will drink soda. While I am being an example to them and I am not alo offending them and I will preach to them by my example. You are not vulnerable. You are being a hypocrite. That's not your place. Come out from what you have been preached to. A believer has no place in a bar. A believer has no place in a discourse. Our place is in the house of God. David said unto me, I was happy when they said unto me, let's go to the house of God. Amen. And we can dance. But our dance is not for the world. Our dance is not for worldly music. We will not betray Jesus. You find a believer because it is a cultural event dancing those sexual dances. Shame on you. We have been made to come out from among them. We are the royal priesthood. We are not like them. Culture has to die. Religion has to die. Oh pastor, are you not taking it too far? Well, I will tell you something. Jesus died and when he died, I died with him. I am born again. I am not a Christian. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. No for us we are see I am not I am called out I will involve myself in their cultural activities as long as they don't make me betray the word but if it is something questionable I am sorry I am not going to be a part of it I'm not going to be a part of it because I am I I am a new creation. But you see, Judas thought he will hit 50/50 and then he will be a winner. I'm a winner either way. No, you cannot. If you betray him, you are done. And he betrayed him and then he waited after kissing him. I don't know what you can do. Jesus, don't disappoint me. I know what you can do. And then Peter came. Peter, a serious believer when a man tried to cut. Peter was angry, picked a knife, cut off the ear. And Jesus was there. Jesus, come on. Come on. I know what you can do. And then Jesus went down. Pet Jesus was like, "Let's do it." And then he picked the ear. And I'm sure whatever Judas was, he told one of those I told my master, "You wait and see what he's sweating. The sweat is sweat of confusion." And he picked the ear and he put it back. He that kills with a sword die with a sword. Put your swords down. And the ear was there. Jesus was like, I knew it. I knew it. Now you can't catch him. Like I said, I'm glad to keep the money and you can't catch my lord. Go and eat the boy. You know, you will not escape him. You will get a disease unless you [Music] repent. We believers We don't hang out with boys and girls. I'm going to hang out. A believer going for shame on you, sister. Shame on you, brother. You are betraying Jesus. You're going to hang out. You sin will take you further. then you want to go. Younger sisters and brothers should be able to shout amen. That's what we stand for. And then Judas was like, "Money is here. My lord is in now." Peter who was making himself spiritual. Even Jesus has rebuked him. He has put back the ear that is defending the word. You can't defend the word for us who decided to go take the money. We are progressing and at the same time they came but they caught Jesus. Judas was like come on my Lord do the thing. Do the thing. You remember the other time when they wanted Jesus and he disappeared. He thought he was going to die and then they caught him another hand. They took him. He followed. So they're beating him. This is different. Something is wrong. I've done wrong. I've done wrong. But when he realized he has done wrong, he did not become vulnerable before God. But he felt guilt. A feeling of guilt is different from a feeling of vulnerability. When you feel guilt, it doesn't mean you are repented. Any human being has a guilt conscience whether they are Christians or not. But a child of God will become vulnerable. Kneel before God and repent of your sin. And repentance means never go back again. And what happened to this man? He felt guilty and he went back to these people and told them I have changed my mind. I cannot take your money. They told him Mr. Judas we are sorry the job is done. You did a good job. You did a good job. You can now go with your money. Then many young ladies in our generation in this neurotic age, they'll begin to say I even want to abort now. Let me tell you, abortion is mother. And unless you repent before God, you will be judged if you do those kind of things. Amen. Repentance is accepting your sin and being vulnerable before you say God have mercy on you. Accept me the way I am. I am ready to walk right. And you know what? At that moment they took the money and bought a field. And this guy went in that place and hanged himself said I have no hope. I am hopeless. He hanged himself. He never [Music] repented. A different heart. Same heart that Cain had. My punishment is greater than I can bear. Genesis 4:13, unrepentant heart, hard heart. But God wants those who have a vulnerable. You see Jesus as our example. When he came on earth, he showed us the same way. He even in his humanity. when he was in the garden before his crucification, he showed vulnerability. He said, and I'm quoting, my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, oh my father, if it be possible, let this cup pass through. That was God in flesh showing vulnerability of a human being. He brought his raw emotions and he still surrendered completely. Can you imagine Jesus said I even feel like dying? That's what it means. I feel like dying. Oh God. Did God kill you? But when he was praying, he expressed his feelings. Brother, sister, learn how to pray, when he come before God. Believe that he is a rewarder of all those who are vulnerable. Hallelujah. The woman with the alabaster box, she wept at Jesus's feet. She wept at Jesus's feet. She washed his feet with tears and anointed them with expensive oil. She was risking rejection from those around her. But Jesus said, "Oh my, it means those who come before Jesus and bow before him, cry, wash his feet. Your expensive clothes, you put it down on the floor. You accept to be vulnerable. It will do something. This woman Jesus told her sins which are many are forgiven. Why? Because of her vulnerability. Her vulnerability led to a deep moment of worship and forgiveness. It means worship is connected to forgiveness. Brother, whenever we you break down in worship, something is happening. You see, David would would sing many of these psalms. They are psalms. They're prayers. Create me. Oh god. And renew a right [Music] spirit. Oh, take me not away. You know he was praying from your presence that is after the scene of mother and take not your holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of your salvation and renew arrived [Music] spirit. God doesn't reject brokenness. and weakness. He meets us there when we are confused, disappointed, and worrying. He meets us. If you give me 10 minutes, I'm going to now Samson, he also was broken. In the book of Judges 16:30, Samson said, let me die with a Philistine. And he bowed himself with all his might. And the house fell upon the Lord's and upon all the people that were there in. So the dead which he slew that day were more than they which he slew in his life. Friends, some times you have to die with your enemy. Samson, brother Paul preached about him the other day. Quite an interesting subject. Samson, a man who was very [Music] lustfully. He It was not only Delila, there were several others one after the other. And this thing broke him. Sin broke him. But when he reached the moment, he said, "No, no, no, no. That's our now vulnerability." He said, "Now, let me die. If I have to die, let me die with my enemy." And God did not say no. God granted the desire, God will receive brokenness every time, every time, every time, every time. You see friends, without money, without price, brother says something interesting. But when our Lord puts his chain of love around your heart and he pulls you from the ditch of sin. He heals every broken heart. He takes away all the sin. And the bill is put in the sea of [Music] forgetfulness. The bill of the the bill the price. He puts you from the ditch of sin. He heals you from every broken heart. He takes away all your sin and you don't have to pay. The bill is thrown into the sea of forgiveness to remember against you no more. Come without money. Come without price. No matter how bad you are cut, how bad you are bruised. No matter how your family has done, some of you have had break, you know, heartbreaks in family, in homes. No matter how your family has done or what you have done, there is no bill to read. He heals the heartaches. [Music] Amen. Yes, sir. Can you say amen? He heals the heartache. He heals the heartaches. I said he heals the heartache. He takes away all your sorrows. If you are sorrowful this morning, Jesus takes away all your sorrows. He was wounded for our transgression. He was breathed for our in the chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes, we were healed. It's all free. Amen. But the problem is many won't receive it. Many won't receive it. And I will tell you why. Because we are dominated by a wrong spirit. Some people have a wrong spirit dominating over them. We are dominated by a spirit of a nation. You see I told you this what the prophet said the national spirit those things spirit they hinder us from breakthrough brethren believe this spirit they hinder our victory. We are dominated by the spirit of the nation, the spirit of the world instead of being dominated by the spirit of God, the Holy Spirit that leads us and guides us to all truth and makes the Bible so perfect strength but perfect weakness. Now bound God passes the nobles. And guess the weakness. God passes those who thinks they are something to take somebody that don't know nothing to order to work his purpose in their life. God said to Paul, "My strength is perfect in your weakness. My strength becomes more perfect. As you become more weaker, more you can yield to me. The better I can use you. The more you can forget about your education, the more you can forget about your denomination, the more you can forget about your stuff and yield yourself to it, the more I can use it because you've become weak. I'll make my own purpose strong. When we accept become weak, God makes his purpose in our life strong. God can make strength out of weakness. That's the reason he always does it. the humility of his own son when he was born in a manger in a manured bar in the cow store and he was wrapped in swaddling clothing. See, he could have come through a palace. He could have come, you know, through the corridors of heaven full of angels salutes. But he chose to make Christ the example for us. And he brought him in humility. He never trained him in the schools of this world, but he trained him by his own power. So he could completely yield himself not to the thoughts of man or the strength of the word, but the to yield himself to the power of God. And that's the way that's what is us today. We yield ourself today. Many times we yield to our great denomination. We yield ourselves to our denominational church. What is God to say what they say about it? But that's contrary to God is we've got to yield ourself to the spirit. the spirit of God and to go where the spirit says go. If you can be so vulnerable, friends, this is so personal to me. If you can be so vulnerable to a moment when God leads you, you obey him. You say, "Lord, if it's your will, I'll go. I'll do it. I don't I don't care who says that. We are his children. He would have let us be born sinless, perfect without any issues. But he allowed many issues to come. So we can be weak. And then his perfect strength can be made known in our weakness. Brethren, if we can accept to be vulnerable in his presence, let's bow our heads. Oh God, forgive us, Lord. Many times Lord we've tried to hide our weakness and try to make ourel as though we are perfect Lord. But Lord you want us to be weak so that you can accept us if we can come to you Lord and express our weakness. Lord Jesus, you are ready to say, "Come on, my child. I will then show my stranger. I will then use you." Lord, that's what you did. And you were born in a manger of God. You were God, but you came through manure through dirt and to show weakness to show us that your strength is made perfect in weakness. Lord, we have a couple weak people here today. No doubt I'm one of them, Lord. We're crying out to you, Lord. Lord, that you will forsake us. Lord, you come and strengthen us. Lord, we may accept to be vulnerable and night. We may accept to carry the cross and follow after you. You did not want us to be perfect, but you wanted us to be weak that your perfection may be sh you this morning while you bow your head. You that thinks you're nothing. You that thinks you are weak, you are good for nothing. You don't even feel like you you ought to be in the crowd. You feel so undeserving. Oh, I speak to you today. You that feels that you're brokenhearted. You that feels you you've failed God many times. But I have a word for you today. And I have a word for you today. God, Amen, has come down for you. And he's speaking to you that Jesus died for you. He came for you, not for anyone else, you in your weakness. He wanted you to be that way. So he can manifest his power and his strength through you. If only you can hold on, you're going to see his strength in your life. He's going to lift you up. Brother Brandham was so weak. Twice he wanted to commit sin. He couldn't do it because there was a purpose in his life. And he reached that moment when he wanted to die. He said, "God, take me again." God couldn't do it. There was purpose in his life. But I tell you something, he became a prophet to a generation. There is something about you that is special. There's something special about you. And you know because the Lord is speaking to you. I don't have to call your name. He has already called your name because this was meant for you. It was meant for you. Hallelujah. Oh, his presence is here, friend. Don't fear to break in his presence. Don't fear to to be frail to to be weak. It is for you. He died. See a prophet cried so weak. But yet there was a greater purpose for him. I am right in the will of God. Tell you you are right in the will. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh yes. Wow. Oh yes. Wow. Oh yes. Wow. Oh yes. You are so weak. because you have a greater purpose. Accept the weakness. Confess your weakness to confess your fears. You don't need to get blood pressure. You don't need to get anxiety. You get it because you are putting your fears inside. Express it to your savior. You have a savior. One who understand. One who is here to help. He will help you for sure. Yes sir. He's a faithful God. He's a savior of our soul. He's a lily of the vine. The bright and morning star. When no one understands, he surely understands. He's closer than a brother. He understands you better than your husband. Your husband or wife, he's here. I want us to have a moment for those who are broken in him to just express their feeling to him. He's a high priest today who can be touched by the feeling of you are in fact. He understands us. He loves you. He wants to help you out of your sin. You may say, "No, I'm a big time sinner. I've covered so much." He understands that, too. Just confess it before him. Repent before him. Accept weakness and fibers. Then the savior will come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The savior will come and carry you. When your back is against the wall, he will come and help you. You may say, "I'm so broke. I don't know what to do. I don't have any help. No one can help me. I'm so poor and wretched." No, he's here. He's a friend. He's a friend in a weary land. No friends, his presence is here. He's a rock in a weary land. He's a show and a time of storm. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just have a moment of real deep consecration before him. Confess your sins to him. Confess your life to him. Just tell him how much you want his help and cry out to him. Don't care about your neighbor. What will think about you? It's about what he will think about you. That's why you have come in his presence here today. He will help you. No man can help you. But he will help you. He will carry you out of your problem. He knows your weakness. He knows your foolishness. He knows the depth of the trial and temptation and he can carry you out. He's a savior. He saves you in every situation. Oh, help us, Lord. I hate you. [Music] Awesome. Awesome. Come [Music] on. Back to you. I will not find me closer to you, Jesus. I'll be closer to you, oh God, everything. Oh Jesus, I bless you. I bless you, Lord.

Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh. Oh, yes. Spirit of God moving here. His presence is here, friends. There's nothing impossible for him to do. He's calling you out by [Music] name. He's a sweet Jesus.

I'll save you out of your troubles. Oh yes, Jesus. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Jesus is the [Applause] savior of my soul. Hallelujah. He is the savior. [Music] As we are going to pray now, I want you with eyes closed, tell the Lord, remember me, remember my need. If you want me to remember you in prayer now, just lift up your hand to him with every head bowed, every eye closed. Lord Jesus, in a moment like this, Lord, through the gift of of the prophet, you would call out people one by one, tell their problems, discern their lives, and tell them it's over. The New Testament preaches a prophet. We have heard the word of prophecy. And at this moment, I'm convinced the same Jesus that walked the streets of Jerusalem, the same Jesus that was with the prophet of this generation, the same that was with the apostles, the God of the Bible is here right now. Lord, we can feel your presence. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Do not pass us by. You see the needs in the body. The needs in every family. The needs in every [Music] home. Oh you know and understand.
