our lord jesus christ i trust that you've had a wonderful week and uh we too have had a good week the lord has been gracious you know as uh you know with the week has been going on wiki tumblr i noticed that uh many messages came through you know this one has died the other one has died it is really disheartening to know that uh they are leaving us you know at the beginning of the actually i think it was the beginning of this week i spoke to brother peter who is a doctor and he told me that they're having very many cases in the hospital there was a container if you do not mind uh one of you have to remind me we'll have you talk to talk to us and tell us what the condition is and maybe to just help the people and uh encourage them to take care whatever they are because you are on the front line and you know whatever is happening there so i'm gonna have yesterday the wife of our brother brother charles omarta just passed away oh proudly your matam challa away against it and uh also in the same week i think a few days ago there's a pastor here i think he's been known by by very many you know uh he passed out with you to cover it but that is not to mean that we our god is dead nature isn't catholic uh he still can heal and deliver people from covey because that's what they say that you would take these sicknesses of the egyptians away from us and uh myself i got the coffee then the lord delivered me so if you get covered or if you have any symptoms and science do not fear to tell us and let us know so that we can be able to pray with you because we believe the lord is still on the throne the different families gathered in their homes we are just the three of us here one two three two oh four actually three bananas myself the brother who is interpreting and uh uh several of you i see brother sam there never uganda you want to show us many of them who are seated there all of you god bless you and i know there are many who could be on the other side my name is yes i think that the sister peace and that peace uh thank you for coming for the fellowship this morning these are people that are just our neighbors and so i know that uh we we are in the same area

the meeting this morning so god bless you for that come on come uh please remind me if i forget send me a text to let me know that you have to speak to us at the end of the service okay so the others have their videos switched off our videos otherwise uh i was thinking that uh they will uh switch on their videos so we can be able to fellowship and just this would be around the time when we would say greet one another you know i i was just thinking this is technology but then there was internal technology it's always good for us to use it for the glory of god i'm always encouraging you to leave whatever it is that you are doing and sit down and have your phone or your computer whatever it is that you're using to attend the service yes because you know that's the reason why we have uh the online church not for you to be doing whatever it is that you are doing and then you know you just listen you are not a spectator you're not just listening in we want you to be participants that's why we are using zoom song on youtube quite a few youtube also uh brother kello holgando god bless you come on come on and uh everybody else that might be on youtube we said you are greetings amen maybe you want to share uh the link with somebody and let them also hear the words praise the name of the lord [Music] [Music] the other time i said inika shaka but it's not kashaka it is uh have i already forgotten again yes [Music] they are gathering with us they are meeting with us actually and they usually uh i think it's youtube youtube i'm sure they're now listening [Music] they were singing that they worshipped their worship they had the service with us and my mind was just once and so they are working with us i believe that where you are you are singing you are clapping you are dancing when we do whatever we are doing you are a part of it bring down the atmosphere of jesus christ in your room someone said is christmas praise the name of the lord amen and let us sing this song when a trumpet of the lord shall sound and time shall be no more [Music] god [Music] when the trumpet of the lord shall sound and time shall be no more and the morning breaks a ton of bright

and see i beseech you there for brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies are living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be it transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god coming up [Music] if you can also give me some for me just some little sound let's pray loving jesus we want to take this moment this morning to thank you for the time that you have the opportunity and the time you have given to us to be in your presence i just pray lord that you will come and take this service lord come and savage yourself father i surrender myself to you come anyway i'm speaking to the pastors of the blood lord jesus give them amen i mean you may have your seats okay so uh this morning by the grace of god i'm speaking on uh so i'm speaking on uh transformed into the nature of christ and before we go into this uh scripture and there's just something which came on my mind right now and i had forgotten about it in ethiopia in the city of awesome we are doing construction soon for the temporary structure for the church so if there is anyone that has a burden to do something there financially to support you no matter how much it is that you really want to give never church and can't extend you and your god who are you uh you are welcome to give two questions i encourage you to give because towards that work that is happening in the city of awesome now the inspiration of this summon was received by me in the service that we preached when i was speaking on the elect according to foreign i will be looking at it in the line of transformation into the nature of christ so i'm requesting uh politely that each of you will you know be fully focused and uh part of the uh thing that tells me that you are focused those of you who are on zoom is for you to switch on your videos [Music] uh i i just pray that you do not divide your attention on this and that nature and server service and when you switch on your video just know that we are also looking at you yeah [Applause] amen amen now i'm speaking on transformed into the nature of christ and uh maybe sister lydia will watch this later but uh you know i was in in in a house brother tim's house you know what's happening and i did by [Music] i think she's about uh oh my wife will judge me for this now because i can't remember i think she's about nine eight or nine no zarya no no no no no so well romans chapter 3 verse 23 it says for all have sinned and have come short of the glory of god i've [Applause] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] did my mother conceived [Music] you don't go to heaven because your mother or your father [Applause] according to the last of the flesh so the bible says for all have sinned of the glory of god amen now that includes all seven have sinned but never you know and have come short of the glory of god this little girl started crying tears just came down i told her are you okay you said you can take an ask and find out upstairs well they sorted it out but it turned out later that her mother told me maybe she said she's fearing injection in the hospital treated her are the ones the bad guys out there and she was like because i am a sinner is [Music] realize [Music] and she said she wanted to be baptized and we baptized her that same day lord jesus christ hallelujah we need to give praise and honor to the father to watch humanity who serves and delivers speaking the seed of god can never perish [Applause] no matter who we are today we might be the seed of god please your question you might be the seed of god or not [Applause] and someone was thinking oh i'm a seed of god because my parents are believers no it doesn't make you a seed of god oh jacob was the younger brother they started fighting the seeds are different they are not the same scissors one is of god and one is not everywhere one was seven seed and another was the seed of god standing there killed more than 68 million christians because they believed they were the only true church and they said the ones that were killing they were heretics and souls [Music] you'll never be son of god [Music] is the bible says in the book of acts chapter 2 as they heard even peter speaking their hearts they were hearing the word being preached the seed of god whenever they hear the word of god their hearts spread them their hearts why because you come in contact with god through this message of the house amen you are not going to let go of it going to read it together come on i am putting on a new nature with you the nature of jesus christ hallelujah can somebody say amen whatever me now praise the i'm also preaching to myself amen and so notice the nature of the seed of the nature of the seed of god it is created in the image of god when adam was created in the image of god but remember the nature of the first man adam was the nature of god [Music] amen his nature was mad have you done that his nature was spoiled and he became a sinner now come on that he was indeed a sinner he was just we have to sin if you tell them when you dress oh hallelujah hallelujah when you trust the nature of the serpent and you trust [Applause] is all right we are born with the nature of sin present when i would turn the way to be both serpent seed and the seed of god we all born we are all born speaking lies envy now to you as a son of god there is no way you can remain that way i am here to announce to you then you are no longer there is no way you can be remain like that about you it is a must to take it that you must be transformed by the renewing of your mind it is a mask [Music] which adam had before of jesus christ i'm missing your presence oh my that's [Applause] already apart from [Music] no it is what are you serious born again when he says every man remains [Applause] christ comes in here holy spirit and he kills them yes your father jesus died of god because he was seen meaning that he died that he might kill the nature of every human being crystal i tell attorneys that the christ kills the nation all the nations that have their new nature christians christ will be born into you tonight oh then if you surrender yourself completely to christ crystal and it comes in here can you highlight that for me and it comes in you next yeah i feel it is too small to emphasize what i'm you [Applause] making a man do his will i will read another quote but you see now why that man was more than just a teacher people say he is today a philosopher or a good man or a prophet i want to run and we recorded a series of videos we shall have them coming out soon i think we shall begin uh this one is the lord willing to look out for those videos project one one segment i was using english and the brother was uh translating to uganda so we were talking about jesus [Applause] of displaying himself in a body that he built for himself amen it reflected and the sinful nature of a man could not do the thing that he did every one of us who was born by our mothers amen that nature came running after us [Applause] of sin no what do you want underwater you become a slave what cannot do of the nature of sin all condiments that's right many times you do not want to do something something is putting on need filled child of god but something is putting on you forcing you to run away from it and that thing which is putting on new sounds and feels nice and it makes you feel satisfied and we are all on with it the because i am son of god the sinful nature of man could not do could not do the thing that he did [Applause] so it had to be god making and reflecting himself in the mind making a mirror really hallelujah [Music] perfect oh he is the perfect [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] it had to display itself and he could not be a savior and and be a natural born man how could he be how could he be a savior if he was born by sexual desire he could not have been born according to the last of the flesh [Music] word of god yesterday he was the even spoken word seed of god that came to restore the lost state yahwah and he gave gifts to men and one of these gifts is the one now god is using to remind you of these things he had to be more than a man it is i found a friend in jesus christ he is everything to me he is the fairest oh ten thousands to my soul [Music] make me see so that my nature i wish you can tell your soul your inner man give me so that my nature can be changed [Music] he was the only one that could do this so much that he was sinless by nature it was sinless [Applause] he wasn't wearing that essa would be that way by star can choice choose the nature of god because within it quran there is no deep to respond to the nature of god look if you do not love me and i tell you shouting on top of my voice i love you you only [Applause] everybody [Music] is [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] hallelujah before he knew what abraham would do you remember when he called him out there and he said he would not keep the thing as separate from him [Applause] god himself i know that abraham will send this message down down from one to the other generations oh then he told abraham in the beginning that he would save him and save his seed after him will run away from the pride of life i know they will not go in the embers run away from those things and because god knew that he called you he knew my brother god because he knows that your nature is with him everybody when [Music] who told you that this is not your father i know mommy i'm going to kill you mama wait then i'll get you down and the mother will go down the couch but [Music] all your siblings look like him but not you are you really the son of the father they say you are the god of the word people come to think of it my father is why because the woman is a type of a church if you want to know your true nature ask yourself which message are you hearing [Applause] a message one day i jesus christ yes because we found have you found your trinity have you found and he says he told abraham in the beginning that he would save him and and save his seed after him and give him the unconditional covenant that he he made with abraham not because abraham was good man because god was good i am not i i am not here in this message because i'm the best singer some people when they come to this message they expect to find angels the only difference between this message and their denominations is because people in this message are on the right track of finding their true nature [Music] the [Music] but this in itself will not be enough for you to find your true nature foreign so if you are hearing someone who is not encouraging you to eat this one then my brother you are not still on the right track every to read the message listen to it because the message where is our lecture our lecture is right here in the bible that's where our nature amen if you understand stop doing the you because he is good man immerse yourself in the message when you kill him don't try to manufacture what we are teaching you know [Music] let the light flow here is a christian tonight because not that you are good but because god was good to call you hey you couldn't even come yourself you just couldn't even uh you just couldn't what did you say you see he said make a pig believe he's wrong eating slow because it's his nature what hello [Applause] it is a transformation [Music] you just stop drinking alcohol some because the people you live with don't want you to drink alcohol because you will reform but you are not transformed i can't see you on zoom doing that transform game that you can and you begin with a soul you begin with the soul before the world was ever formed you begin with a soul it takes care it moves with this if you just get why god chose you right because they knew you would overcome your mind because he knew you had an inheritance and that inheritance is with him praise the name of the lord come in hallelujah hallelujah i'll have to put this to the next service but for now naked receive the nature of christ what is the nature of christ specifically that is what we are going to go into it talks about several things faith virtue knowledge it's real quick whether or not you have the nature of christ you know i can simply say the nature of christ is the holy spirit but i wouldn't want it to just ease it up for you that way yes i got a chicken she goes away into you because you will have many questions after that i will definitely be how can i receive the holocaust can [Music] influence what is you must be transformed you take the truth into the nature of christ the holy ghost is not something that just comes down the nature of christ something which just comes down switch into a chima like a cow and see it is a transformation you know when we talk about the holy ghost it is the same thing as the nature of christ church you know upon their christians because the holy spirit says it is a person it's not something sitting it is a person [Music] of william branham see now but they never turn around i would behave like him i would talk right now i would do things if i had the nature of william shakespeare if i had the nature of the world singing but they know the ways i would do the things of the world and see if i had the nature of my church i would behave the way my church behaves this is them hungary you know sometimes people go in churches and instead of finding the nature of christ they go shopping the nature of those churches [Applause] our god is expecting us to have his divine nature transform transformation they were being transformed into the nature of christ whereby he would cease to be you it will not be him in you doing his will in you then you can stand and vividly without doubt and testify no julia i have the holy spirit i'm filled with the holy ghost i'm going to the rapture why because you have the nature of christ amen god bless you all amen i mean i'll continue from there on sunday amen hallelujah

do not have the internet and things like that if you want to support you can send it directly to brother can you put up that contact for the titles and offerings you can actually go ahead and also send your typhus and your offerings on those numbers and uh if you're sending some money to support this youth program let us know also okay let us pray and then uh i'll have uh is brother peter still here yes as that number is there i think let me invite brother peter to uh to pray for us after prayer then he will speak to us a bit about he's a doctor and uh i'd like i would like for the church and for all of you to know how serious this thing is and for you to be very serious in protecting yourself and your loved ones okay can you all see him i think you might know what we're gonna do we shall put up the number for you again a little bit remember jesus yes brother peter god bless you can you hear me come on thank you for the gift of life and that we are still alive i mean these days accomplishes that we are passing through father i would like to glorify your name and we turn the praise back to you god as we are passing through uncertainties we appeal to you that you abide with us let your guidance lead us through until your will will be done i pray for each brother that is attending the program that you may lead us and guide us in wisdom and knowledge of your word help us that at the end of the day the life of christ may be bestowed upon us in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen so i would like to thank our pastor chance that he has given me [Music] blood am i clear yes we are clear and we can hear you yeah this person that is uh is around is still very uncertain so right now from our side the medical want the people to do their best to fulfill all the standard operating measures we should note them good let the people keep their masks as much as they can we want the people to sanitize and wash their hands the best that they can we want the people to try to avoid unnecessary meetings because the science is true that the disease is transported by people so we want to uh keep all the sops until the wave has passed and we want to encourage the people to feed well because when your immunity is up it is easy for you to come over this problem and the from my side i want to ask the people so that we trust god because at the end of the day what is a good physician uh those few words i would like to say god bless you all and shalom brother peter before you go i just wanted to ask you uh in your hospital are you having convinced patients also we have had patients but we have discharged we only left one patient right now of course otherwise we have been quite a number of them so it's it's quite serious it's quite on the rise now yes yes yes so so so much now yeah so god bless you for that information and thank you also for praying for us so saints you have had i just pray that you keep yourself safe you keep your loved ones safe you keep your family safe we are also doing as much as we can to always keep ourselves safe uh you know while you pray well let us utilize this time to do the right things you know let us not only because schools are closed no one is going to school and you know instead of speeding your mind with whatever is going going on out there take your time to prepare yourself for the coming of the lord i think that's the most noble thing you can do at this time uh so instead of uh you know uh going out with friends and we're not even believers and maybe you get covered do the bible study i'm talking to the young people now do the bible study get into the message read it take your time read it and uh we will be very very serious whenever we meet we want to find what everybody has read and how they understand what they read and let's see what the holy spirit will do in us during this time of lockdown i just believe that the lord will surely move in our hearts uh if you want to send in your offering your your type please use those two numbers they are numbers of brother joel brother yowery uh he is uh our current uh uh uh treasurer i think i should call him is helping us with a with a uh keeping these offerings so please send it over to him and do not give to the lord as if you were giving to man give to the lord as you again as if you were given to the lord you know give generously because it is going to be used for a noble cause there is nothing that you give to the work of god that we are using the wrong way we use all of it for the sake of the lord personally i've never taken anything out of it whatever you give it is used for the work of the lord so i believe that god will bless your giving as as you do as you give those of you who are on youtube god bless you and thank you for attending the service and uh may he bless you so much amen did you get that song from me oh this people did not get the song all right so uh let us pray and then we shall sing a chorus as we dismiss let us pray at this missing prayer blessed precious jesus we love you so much we give you praise we give you honor and glory you've done marvelously you've done wondrously and you've given to
