[38:12] evening late bright Tabernacle is
[38:19] streaming this
[38:21] by way of zoom on their Channel
[38:27] so we send our greetings to the Saints
[38:30] there as well
[38:33] we are taking our Bibles the book of
[38:36] First Genesis the first book of the
[38:39] Bible Genesis
[38:46] Genesis chapter one
[38:48] verses 1 to 4.
[39:07] but if you're not kindly because
[39:14] so we're looking at Genesis 1. today
[39:18] videos
[39:26] [Music]
[39:31] are we happy to be in the house of the
[39:33] Lord
[39:40] so these are the first words in in your
[39:43] Bible
[39:45] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[39:48] and the Earth
[39:50] and the Earth was without form and void
[39:53] and darkness was upon the face of the
[39:55] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[39:57] the face of the waters
[39:59] foreign
[40:36] praise the Lord come here may be seated
[40:39] I'm speaking to you today on chaos stand
[40:41] to order by the spoken one
[40:43] [Music]
[40:43] um
[40:49] God is not man to God is God and
[40:54] whatever God speaks
[40:58] man can speak presumptuous
[41:01] but God speaks surely
[41:04] that is why he the word of God is called
[41:07] a sure Word of Promise
[41:11] God
[41:14] speaks what he knows
[41:17] God and whatever he knows
[41:21] whatever he says
[41:27] powerful
[41:29] tell your neighbor God is what is
[41:31] powerful
[41:34] and you see no matter the chaos
[41:59] [Music]
[42:17] [Music]
[42:25] [Music]
[42:35] foreign he said well if they keep quiet
[42:38] the stones
[42:41] how could the stone shout because they
[42:45] would shout because they were they would
[42:46] have been under
[42:50] instructions
[42:51] [Music]
[42:54] everything must bow
[42:56] to the spoken word
[42:59] remember when uh Prophet Balaam was
[43:02] going to cast Israel
[43:05] God told him don't go
[43:08] and because he thought he was Heavy High
[43:11] minded
[43:13] a love of money more than lover of the
[43:16] word of God
[43:19] he thought that he had his own free will
[43:22] moral agency
[43:27] like many of us many times we think we
[43:30] can turn God and I'm twist him to do
[43:32] what we want um
[43:55] it has been established and so the
[44:00] prophet thought that he will you know
[44:01] God told him it's all right you can go
[44:03] again
[44:05] but that was permissive
[44:09] but the original word of God is usually
[44:12] the perfect will of God
[44:17] and so the prophet decided to go again
[44:21] with a permissive will of God
[44:23] can you allow me to say tonight that the
[44:26] will of God always stands
[44:34] you can bother yourself somewhere
[44:44] [Music]
[45:06] [Music]
[45:32] you know
[45:34] that's enough you cannot pass here
[45:37] and the donkey could see the angel of
[45:41] the Lord yes
[45:48] was full of himself
[45:55] I did not want to he did not want to
[45:58] hear the world
[46:05] that we had to say
[46:16] the animals
[46:20] [Music]
[46:24] but the man was so blinded
[46:27] that he could not see that this was an
[46:30] animal speaking
[46:33] [Music]
[46:48] foreign
[47:00] so God spoke in the beginning
[47:03] when God spoke in the beginning
[47:07] he did not speak to human beings
[47:11] today where no human beings forgot to
[47:13] speak to the world
[47:15] but God spoke his word into air
[47:20] the Bible says he had created heaven and
[47:22] Earth
[47:24] but the Earth was without forms
[47:29] and darkness was upon the face of the
[47:31] day
[47:33] that was chaos
[47:36] in the beginning there was chaos
[47:41] he spoke to chaos
[47:44] Hallelujah and he says let there be
[47:47] light
[47:49] who did God speak to Katrina there was
[47:52] no human being he was speaking to chaos
[47:57] he was speaking to all that confusion
[48:00] to the mixture of darkness and you know
[48:03] you know you know Waters and everything
[48:06] you know you know he spoke
[48:29] [Music]
[48:33] [Applause]
[48:38] the Bible says in verses
[48:41] um in verses 3 says and the spirit of
[48:44] God moves
[48:49] and the spirit of God moves
[48:53] do you know always the spirit precedes
[48:56] the word or whatever the judge
[49:02] and also always the spirit proceeds
[49:05] [Music]
[49:09] you cannot hear the word accept it and
[49:12] believe it without the spirit
[49:19] why are you here today why are you
[49:23] hearing this to those of you on zooming
[49:28] to those of you who are here you decided
[49:30] to come
[49:32] how come you were here the spirit of God
[49:38] to come to this place you know you see
[49:41] the spirit of God goes out fast yeah and
[49:45] then he brings the world
[49:47] now when the world comes you cannot
[49:51] receive the word
[49:53] without the spirit of God
[50:00] spirit of God will always
[50:04] precede the word and to proceed the
[50:07] words
[50:09] are you hearing me
[50:19] [Music]
[50:21] the spirit of God moves
[50:26] if you have someone next to you tell
[50:27] them the spirit of God
[50:31] the spirit of God moves
[50:34] and what
[50:37] we have time when God spoke the word
[50:45] and when the word went foreign
[51:29] foreign

[1:09:47] is somewhere
[1:09:49] you know the first king soar yeah
[1:09:53] Saul was not even a spiritual man
[1:10:01] God Came Upon him the spirit of God
[1:10:07] and before you know it the man was
[1:10:10] jumping up
[1:10:11] prophesy
[1:10:16] has it now also become one of them
[1:10:22] that when the spirit of God Came Upon
[1:10:24] David
[1:10:26] what did he do
[1:10:28] he did I would take two things he did
