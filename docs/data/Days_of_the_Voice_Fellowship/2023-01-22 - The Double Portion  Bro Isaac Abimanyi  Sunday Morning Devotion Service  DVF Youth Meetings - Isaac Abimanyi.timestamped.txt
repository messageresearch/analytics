[12:22] we talk about something
[12:26] and then
[12:28] second Kings chapter 2 verse 9.
[12:36] all right
[12:38] and it came to pass when they were gone
[12:41] over
[12:42] that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I
[12:47] shall do for thee before I be taken away
[12:49] from thee
[12:51] and Elisha said I pray the late a double
[12:54] portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[13:00] foreign
[13:04] foreign
[13:36] foreign
[14:22] and it is according to God's purpose
[14:26] and you should understand that you are
[14:30] here for a purpose
[14:32] otherwise you would have been somewhere
[14:34] in the world enjoying the world
[14:38] never to waste any single moment

[15:48] praise God
[15:49] Hallelujah
[15:51] praise the Lord Jesus Christ so I want
[15:54] to talk about some little thing here
[15:57] expecting
[16:15] foreign
[16:49] it seems to be funny but some of us we
[16:52] don't pray in the morning
[16:55] I was there in the dormitory yesterday
[16:59] but some youth not even
[17:01] prayers yes we come from the bed and
[17:04] then they take off
[17:06] my name is
[17:09] a minister told us that we should cry to
[17:12] the Lord every morning
[17:14] that is when you commit your day to the
[17:17] Lord
[17:19] praise God
[17:21] Hallelujah I mean this should be our
[17:23] custom
[17:25] it should be our Behavior yeah
[17:28] when we are I fight as Christians
[17:32] praise God
[17:35] who knows about it is a matter about
[17:38] money not every morning you have to go
[17:40] down on your knees and you pray
[17:43] but yet
[17:45] [Music]
[17:47] praise God what you prayed in the
[17:50] morning for the Lord to give you is
[17:54] praise God
[17:56] praying in the morning
[17:59] that is where you get your strength from
[18:07] I want to talk about this man called
[18:09] Elijah
[18:11] I was a young man like you
[18:14] like you Hallelujah I mean
[18:19] praise God
[18:21] Elijah serving God
[18:24] and then his time was over
[18:27] to take him home
[18:30] then Elijah
[18:32] was the man that was following Elijah
[18:35] now it was time for Elisha to take over
[18:39] foreign
[19:12] we have got about ahead
[19:15] and time is going to come when the
[19:18] pastor shall be taken out
[19:20] today you are a sister you're going to
[19:23] be a mom
[19:25] ENT
[19:30] you're going to be a minister
[19:33] some people have to look at you
[19:35] picking the character you have
[19:38] as an example
[19:40] foreign
[20:17] is there something that should come into
[20:20] your mind
[20:21] that you come here for a purpose and a
[20:24] purpose is to serve the world
[20:26] Hallelujah I mean some of you maybe you
[20:29] came here just to see your brother your
[20:31] sister
[20:32] and even some of you maybe you came
[20:35] looking for a some young sister
[20:37] [Music]
[20:42] whatever
[20:47] foreign
[21:19] elders
[21:23] [Music]
[21:31] Ray is The Wonderful Name of Jesus
[21:33] Christ
[21:39] I talk about the elders
[21:41] Hallelujah when I talk about the elders
[21:45] I talk about the pastor other Elders in
[21:49] the church
[21:51] time is going to come
[21:54] when you will have to take over what the
[21:56] pastor has been doing has been doing
[21:59] [Music]
[22:00] you will have to stand and preach
[22:04] today but you have to start it now
[22:10] [Music]
[22:12] praise God
[22:13] hallelujah not just to pass on time but
[22:18] he's just molding his character in you
[22:21] such that you can serve him
[22:24] praise God now Elijah
[22:28] understood his purpose or the purpose in
[22:32] his life
[22:34] and he decided to follow Elijah whatever
[22:36] he could go
[22:37] [Music]
[22:42] was going to be taken away
[22:44] and no one was with him other than
[22:47] Elijah
[22:49] hallelujah praise the wonderful Jesus
[22:52] Christ
[22:54] when time came in verse 9 where are we
[22:57] ready
[22:59] says it came to pass
[23:01] when they were gone over
[23:08] I shall do for this
[23:11] before I be taken away from me
[23:14] and Elisha said
[23:18] let a double portion of thy Spirit be
[23:22] upon him
[23:29] the overcoming generation we have been
[23:32] talking about
[23:34] we don't need a single a single person
[23:38] we need a double portion
[23:41] in everything that we ask from God we
[23:45] should ask for a double portion
[23:48] Hallelujah because God is able to give
[23:51] it to you more than you think
[23:54] blessings
[23:57] for a double portion
[24:00] that is this year that is what this
[24:02] young man got uh got revealed on
[24:06] I'm thinking about Elisha he knew that a
[24:10] single person is not enough for him
[24:15] Hallelujah it was an energetic
[24:18] was powerful he was determined and
[24:22] ambitious I knew very well that a single
[24:25] person
[24:26] it's not going to take him anywhere
[24:29] so he asked for a double portion
[24:33] hallelujah praise God and you should ask
[24:37] for another person everything you asked
[24:39] from God you should ask about it
[24:43] praise God I mean because the Bible's
[24:46] God promises everywhere we read
[24:49] and they are our promises because we are
[24:52] the seed over Abraham we are the
[24:55] spiritual Israelites
[25:03] and more
[25:05] according to your faith
[25:07] so whenever you're asking God
[25:09] praying to God in the morning tell him
[25:12] Lord give me a double portion
[25:16] hallelujah praise God let us catch the
[25:20] same Revelation that Elisha coach
[25:25] put in the Bible as our example foreign
[26:02] that you might learn from
[26:05] Hallelujah and you become an overcoming
[26:08] a generation
[26:12] Hallelujah why is it that we don't
[26:15] overcome these days
[26:17] because we limit ourselves
[26:20] when you go to pray you pray for one
[26:23] hour I mean for 30 minutes
[26:26] 20 minutes
[26:27] Hallelujah and even some of you you pray
[26:30] when you are on your bed already lying
[26:34] Hallelujah I mean sometimes even some of
[26:37] you pray foreign
[26:45] [Music]
[27:08] spiritual blessings
[27:22] some of us even don't even take time to
[27:25] read the Bible
[27:27] Hallelujah yes the Bible should be uh it
[27:31] is considered to be a
[27:35] a shield and a spirit of a Believer
[27:42] praise God
[27:45] even even though when you are at school
[27:47] you have to be having the Bible you read
[27:50] it today
[27:52] is The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ
[27:54] away I know you've got Bibles on your
[27:57] phones
[28:00] you have to have this Bible
[28:05] praise the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah
[28:08] amen so we should be youth of purpose
[28:12] that is when we are going to overcome
[28:14] all right
[28:19] no foreign
[28:51] Hallelujah not to just sing about it
[28:55] to just sing about it
[28:58] sometimes we sing one of the people and
[29:01] then you see people singing and shouting
[29:03] Hallelujah I mean because when there are
[29:06] some songs that takes us back to air uh
[29:10] maybe we get accumulated when we sing
[29:14] when we sing about one of them you see
[29:17] people getting stimulated they dance
[29:21] their hands everywhere
[29:23] [Music]
[29:25] but then when you tell them sing I
[29:28] Surrender
[29:30] [Applause]
[29:32] Hallelujah they say
[29:39] forgetting that there is a certain
[29:41] meaning in that song
[29:45] about it it lifts you up and higher
[29:49] for them they like songs that let them
[29:52] flow their hands in the air and they
[29:55] dance and they enjoy
[29:56] reflecting
[30:00] how they used to do it when they were in
[30:02] this in the Disco
[30:05] praise God I mean Hallelujah I mean
[30:07] praise God but we should ever meditate
[30:11] upon those words you know
[30:14] when you're singing one of them let it
[30:16] be your prayer the Lord
[30:20] hallelujah praise God not just to sing
[30:24] anyhow
[30:25] so it should be a prayer every morning
[30:28] when you're going to church
[30:30] if you're going to visit one person in
[30:33] that church or in our church I'd be one
[30:36] of those people
[30:39] back to have praise God that is the
[30:41] purpose of praying in the morning
[30:44] Hallelujah that is where your strength
[30:46] comes from
[30:51] don't pray in the morning
[30:53] if you don't pray any money if you don't
[30:55] start your day by reading the word of
[30:57] God
[30:58] I don't know where your strength comes
[31:00] from
[31:01] Hallelujah I mean that is why we are
[31:03] having a weak generation
[31:06] but we came here we come here
[31:11] hallelujah to give you some golden
[31:14] nuggets
[31:15] that you might be rejuvenated
[31:18] that you may get transformed
[31:23] Jesus Christ
[31:25] is why you came here
[31:28] Hallelujah
[31:33] praise God so make sure I don't live
[31:36] here when you're not in the Bible
[31:40] you are still called somehow you're
[31:42] still formal oh yeah
[31:45] because when you should go down on your
[31:46] knees
[31:48] for the remaining services
[31:50] to me touch me once more not just to
[31:54] sing about it
[32:02] they deliver
[32:04] when you're contemplating about the
[32:05] message
[32:08] Hallelujah the people that composed
[32:11] those songs
[32:18] came after composing such songs
[32:22] Hallelujah I mean the anointing Came
[32:25] Upon them they composed the songs after
[32:29] composing them when the anointing left
[32:32] to them
[32:34] some of them killed themselves
[32:38] this song
[32:41] There is a fountain to always filled
[32:43] with bread
[32:51] the anointing afterwards left
[32:55] then he
[32:56] searched for that Fountain welcome he
[32:59] searched for that Fountain but he could
[33:02] not find it still when he hanged himself
[33:06] what I mean the songs had anointing upon
[33:10] them
[33:11] and they are still having anointing upon
[33:14] them
[33:15] they've got deep deeper meaning
[33:18] foreign
[33:32] [Music]
[33:52] a generation of Overcomers
[33:55] [Music]
[33:58] he was so ambitious
[34:01] for the things of God
[34:04] not ambitious for the things of the
[34:06] world
[34:08] because when you love the world
[34:10] is not in you
[34:13] praise God
[34:15] they are contrary if you love the things
[34:17] of God
[34:19] you learn to hate the things of the
[34:21] world
[34:23] praise God hallelujah I'm saying Elisha
[34:28] was a person that loved the things of
[34:30] God
[34:31] sorry forsook the world and followed a
[34:34] servant of God
[34:38] that is what we should do
[34:40] it
[34:44] whatever we have on our side
[34:48] the preacher said every way we should
[34:50] late aside
[34:53] Hallelujah and run this race
[34:55] successfully and Faithfully
[35:02] Hallelujah every way hatred which I
[35:05] married
[35:13] when he's a liar
[35:22] praise God
[35:24] maybe it is a way of Escape
[35:28] praise God I mean but I'm telling you
[35:30] brother sister
[35:33] then the same thing
[35:38] [Music]
[35:39] because they are all flute so
[35:45] yeah
[35:46] who can tell me lie mother mother
[35:51] fornication
[36:06] because you know what to do and then you
[36:09] reject to do it
[36:12] then that is unbelief as a Believer you
[36:16] know it's very well that you should not
[36:17] lie
[36:19] you should not commit fornication
[36:24] the pastor is not seeing me the
[36:27] difference
[36:28] when you enter into that house of that
[36:31] boy knowing
[36:33] the house of that sister
[36:38] praise God hallelujah what does the
[36:42] devil does in this generation
[36:44] he uses fornication
[36:47] among the youth
[36:49] praise God take away the power okay
[36:55] praise God I mean the power would have
[36:58] used to serve God
[37:01] praise God Amen then he takes it away
[37:05] with fornication
[37:10] he takes away the love of God and then
[37:13] he gives you lies
[37:17] instead of overcoming whatever you go
[37:19] down on your knees
[38:16] [Music]
[38:18] because God has got a purpose over your
[38:21] life
[38:23] Hallelujah when he looks out to you
[38:26] he sees an overcomer he sees an
[38:30] overcoming generation
[38:32] of
[38:33] Overcomers now
[38:38] pictures of preached the gospel
[38:40] why does oh what is the devil going to
[38:43] do
[38:45] he is going to tempt you in the very
[38:47] things you've had here again
[38:53] that is where the Temptations are going
[38:56] to come from when you go back home
[39:04] to watch and pray
[39:08] some of us we pray and then we don't
[39:09] watch
[39:11] just pray and go on then you find the
[39:15] person who was praising in the church
[39:19] then he's taken under fornication
[39:22] why because we pray and sometimes we
[39:25] don't watch
[39:32] [Applause]
[39:37] seven
[39:50] Hallelujah Nina praise The Wonderful
[39:53] Name of Jesus Christ
[39:54] I pray you take these words and it's so
[39:57] crucial yeah
[40:02] praise God because we don't know whether
[40:05] we shall get this one this time uh This
[40:08] Moment again
[40:10] we don't know what is going to happen
[40:12] tomorrow maybe we shall be taken the
[40:13] tomatoes

[40:21] that is why you should even have
[40:23] somewhere you're joking
[40:25] Hallelujah

[40:50] that James chapter 7.

[41:19] s
[41:23] we just resist the devil
[41:28] by praying and watching look I'm reading
[41:33] the word of God
[41:35] hallelujah hallelujah
[41:41] I was talking to a certain brother
[41:42] sometimes
[41:44] I don't rush for the devil and he said I
[41:48] don't rush
[41:51] I give him some time praise God so after
[41:56] some time he was taken under fornication
[42:02] up to now he's not back to church
[42:06] he was giving devil some space of time
[42:09] you understand he said I don't rush for
[42:12] the devil
[42:15] God of him
[42:19] and now it is here there it is years
[42:22] he's not hit back to church
[42:25] please just resist the devil
[42:28] praise God
