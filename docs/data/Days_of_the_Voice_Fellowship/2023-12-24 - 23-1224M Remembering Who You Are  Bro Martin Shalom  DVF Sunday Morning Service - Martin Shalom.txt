to give before uh I go into preaching last week I forgot I went straight to the word because uh because of the time uh I remember I uh I remember telling you uh giving you uh the information or the report about my journey to the east my sister's wedding was last the other Saturday uh so that night of the after the wedding uh you know it rain and also people were very many so it so happened that uh we were caught up that side by the time you realized it was already too late and we did not have uh okay they did not have a proper arrangement for the transportation of uh of of parents so I realized that uh my parent were still stuck so I had to arrange to see how to take them home so we left the venue because the venue took place at the groom's home so we left at around uh it was I think approaching it was already the mid night so there are two roads that goes to our home but the main road had a lot of ditches and being that uh it had rained so the road was so bad so my father told me requested me to take another route it's a bit a longer route but it was at least was a good route it had no dishes so so happened that as we were going I was driving them home and uh we we reached somewhere that place is a little bit swampy and if you see it had Rice Garden on the either on the both side so it was like a kind of a swampy place but deep so as we were okay as I was driving uh I realized from afar I saw like it's like I was seeing logs on the road so I asked my dad that maybe this road is closed so what I did I put when I put the full light I realized it was like it was a roadblock at night it was already approaching one something like uh uh it was 54 past midnight then I saw uh there was somebody who was just seated near that carod block so I first took it easy I said maybe then I started to reverse so immediately after I just engag the reverse gear then I saw the man coming toward us from nowhere others came from the bush like six of them they had pangas they had ax they had big logs or big sticks so all of them were armed with weapon which were not guns you know my dad uh he was working with uh police and so he told me do you know what those are Thugs and guess what we are parked in the car we we like eight or nine of us so Brethren immediately I felt like like the death angel had overed over us it was it was like those people of nevi where they were told that everybody to cry for his God blessed be the name of the Lord in fact it was so scaring and some of even some the things which happen in the car which I may not tell you but uh I just wondered now how we going to go about this we could not go back and so we just started praying because the Bible says that the name of the Lord is strong and mighty tower where righteous run and also the bible say that is a very present hope in time of trouble so this guy came others putting on jumpers with hood very tough very angry and very annoyed they had scaring continents blessed be the name of the Lord H so I thought maybe since my dad is maybe will my brother let me tell you I learned something in fact I think I even I learned a very big sermon that a security Personnel without gun is nobody the big man was so quiet because I remember for me I don't have any experience even of uh of an arrow but we trusted God they started asking us very many any question so they said they they requested me to come out of the car I told them no I cannot get out of the car but what I did I locked the car and I raised a little bit the window and honestly I was very sober and Vigilant I not even put I don't remember putting off the car engine because I said if wor comes the wor I will knock some whatever happen will happen but still I was trusting God because they had pangas they had a they had [Music] a so finally we were there for some good time I think more than 30 minutes so they asked where are you coming from say we from the wedding of our daughter where are you going someone say he coming from the way and you're asking where he's going we are going home where is your home he told them why are you moving at this time as if they the one to determine for us so when were there others were praying others were scared the prayer which they prayed maybe few weeks ago was what was standing for them uh so they told me when they requested me to come out I refused I told them no and uh they were asking me question as I was also asking them question there is some how how God gave me boldness and maybe I thought that maybe they also said but why is this this young man Bor like this and indeed they also risk because if we had guns in our car that would be another story so finally they went and negotiated uh they went and talk to themselves then they came back to me and they went back again so when they came back then they asked me for 20,000 Ugandan shillings I just knew this battle is over and you know what I gave them 15,000 I told them I don't have 20 but maybe I can I give you what I have they never took our phone because I realize the magnitude of the problem which we had bumped into after we had left they would have have taken our phon our wallet maybe given us chioko and even go with the car but the angel of the Lord was there God protected us they took nothing from us apart from the 15,000 which we gave them blessed be the name of the Lord so friends our God is faithful if it wasn't the grace of God it would be another story I was there with my mother my father my daughter my brother's two children my cousin sister then my aunt and then a friend to our mom so that would be another story but I thank you for your prayer that's why it's always good to pray for one another may God bless you so much amen amen shall We rise on our [Music] feet I know people are Waring for Christmas out [Music] there and uh we thank God that uh we know the prophet tells us that Christmas is not a day of Celebration but it's a day of worship so you are the people who know the real Christmas amen precious Lord Jesus we come before th throne of grace this morning Lord your word is dependable and nobody has ever trusted and depended on your word and

when Jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when you come our tears are wiped away you take the Gloom and Jesus the life is filled with glory Lord Jesus you told us to father to pick up the broken pieces and bring them to you as you say that come unto me all those who are yoke with the heavy lading and Lord you will give us rest Lord we need your rest this morning come Lord Jesus and have your

chapter 10 vers 9 to 23 Hebrews chapter 10 having therefore Brethren having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the Hol and in the holies by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he ha consecrated created for us through the through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from un evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise let us consider one another to let us consider one another to provoke and to love and to Good Works forsaking not not forsaking assembling of our soul together as the manner of some is but exalting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching Lord Jesus we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read we know that any man can turn the face the pages of this Bible and can read maybe because we went to school or because we know how to read but it takes you to make this word alive and we seeing you said in your word that when the spirit that raised Christ from the dead when he come and dwelleth in us he will Quicken our motor bodies precious father come and Quicken our motor bodies this morning Lord Jesus speak to each one of us and by the end of this service that we live here Lord when we are blessed and encouraged in Christ Jesus we pray amen yeah our visitors you're welcome we are glad to have you this morning in our mid East Amen Let us read 1 John Chapter 3: 2 also 1 John 3: 2 pray for me this morning for God to uh speak to you beloved now are we sons of God and it do not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that has this hope in him purifi himself even as he is pure amen praise the Lord where we have read here it tells us that uh in 1 John 3:2 the Bible says that beloved now we are sons of God now you are sons of God and it do not yet appear what we shall be but when he when but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for he shall see for we shall see him as he is nobody is going to see the Lord for you you shall see him as he is amen and this morning uh we are going [Music] to we are going to remind ourselves of who we are amen because if you don't know who you are if you don't know where you come like where you came from where you are right now and where you are going then that's where the bible say that without Vision people perish amen so this morning I just want us to remind ourself of who we are and what I'm what I can tell you this morning is that you are the sons of God you are the daughters of God Amen we are the children of God blessed be the name of the the Lord the Bible tells us in John 4: 24 that God is spirit and those who worship him they Worship the Lord in spirit and if we are the children of God we are supposed to worship God in spirit in fact we have that element of spiritual being in US amen that's why the prophet says that without the Holy Spirit we have not even begun you have not even begun to worship God blessed be the name of the Lord and all of us we waiting for the Rapture how many wait for Rapture here each one of us we know that one of these days God is going to take his charge but where the secret is the bible say that when he comes he will not step on Earth amen those who will be called be when they alive they'll be caught up they'll fly up to meet Christ in the air blessed be the name of the Lord and here where we have read in Hebrews Hebrews chapter 10: 19- 23 it tells us something vers 19 it says and having there boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus without the blood of Jesus we cannot have that boldness to come before the Lord amen and that's why Jesus came because the bible say that for God so Lov the world John 3:16 that he gave his only begotten for what we all know that when man sin in the garden of Aiden man lost his inheritance Amen in the Bible the prophet says that did the title did went back to God so man lost his position in Eden blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why Jesus came to bridge that gap between man and God and that's why the Bible says that there is no any other mediator between man and God L Jesus Christ and that's why we Believers we don't pray through somebody to speak to to God Amen because we have an atonement and that is the blood of Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord and he said having therefore Breen bold to enter in the Holy in the Holiness by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way amen that is the new and the living way the new and the Living Way comes through Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord amen then he says and the living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God you know the Bible says Jesus Christ is the high priest who is touched by the faing of an infirmities Jesus knows what you feel even now Jesus knows what you're going through Jesus knows what is troubling you Jesus knows our troubles he knows our cares he knows our worries amen he cares for us he fights for us blessed be the name of the Lord because he is the high priest of our confession he is touched by what we are going through by what by our feelings amen that is what the Bible says and that's why most time it doesn't matter how you are feeling you know the devil operates the devil always operates through our feelings he comes and creates a funny atmosphere around you until you think that is the devil because the devil can he can play with your feeling and he will still play with it as long as you're still in this flesh amen blessed be the name of the Lord let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from un evil conscious and our bodies washed with pure water that pure water is not like Victoria amen but that is the blood of Jesus Christ there is a song that say that water cannot wash away my sin but wash me with the blood of the lamb and I be white as snow amen so it is the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses us what makes the difference between us and den domination is not even the way we worship the way we sing they also sing if you get angryan when if you have if you go and attend angan anointed worship brother I remember when we were still at Zana there those they could have there overnight and they will start at 7 up to 6: a.m. in the morning nonstop real worship amen blessed be the name of the Lord but what maketh difference it is the blood of Jesus Christ and that's why brother sister each one of us there are challenges there are things which sometime like for example if you look at the most of the preaching if not all of the preaching it is put putting emphasis on new birth Bap of the Holy Spirit the reason as why it's like that because without that we have not even become a worshiper amen but when we receive the spirit of Christ it is him that places us in our rightful positions blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why even the Bible most time the Bible tells us you hear where we have read in first John tells us now we are the children of God he reminding us some says you are of God little children and greater is he that is in you amen John apostle John is reminding us amen about who we are we must know who we are blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord amen blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet gives us example of a slave who was sold who was in Europe amen he was working one of the chambas there but here in Africa where he came from he was a son of a king amen and the Bible and the prophet says that he behaved differently why because he knew his identity blessed be the name of the Lord they are different blessed be the name of the Lord but when you find a Christians young Brothers cracking jokes Chu blessed be the name of the Lord amen he say he tells us that having a high priest over the house of God let us throw with True Heart in full Assurance of Faith amen having our hearts sprinkled from unevoc [Applause] conscious and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the pro of our faith without wavering brother was wavering let us hold first the profession of our faith without there must be a line a difference between the world in the church blessed be the name of the Lord amen who we are we will be different from the world because brother sister the world does not come to church it is the church members it is the Believers in the church it is the Saints in the church who goes in the world and bring the world to the church blessed be the name of the Lord it is very hard for the world to come in the church that is the people in the church who go out there and bring the world into the church and the moment the world enters the church there is the hinderance to the work of God blessed be the name of the Lord amen but if we have clear conscious amen If We Hold Fast that which is good would have a wonderful service amen blessed be the name of the Lord and that is the working of the devil those are the tricks of the enemy because the devil knows it's very hard for him to enter here amen because the devil will have to get a vessel to work through blessed be the name of the Lord but this morning brother sister I want us to know who we are to realize blessed be the name of the Lord that we are the children of God we are the redeemed the prophet tells us that without you even the the apostles the saint will not be perfected amen without the bride of Christ Christ they will remain in their grave Abraham will remain where he is blessed be the name of the Lord the Saints will remain where they are they are waiting for us amen and the Bible says that the bride has made herself ready by what by the word we are cleansed Brothers Samuel I would just request you to you try to go and stand behind Deacon Brothers I don't expect you to do that this time unless you're suffering begins from here amen if they would only the prophet say that uh in the message the DAT of Jesus Christ that I know this to be the truth I know people don't realize who they are every person in here can live above sin can live without sin live in God you will make mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you amen and that's what we have read here that having there for boldness to enter in the Holiness of holies by the blood of Christ amen by the blood of Jesus and here he says but the blood of Christ will forgive you if only we realize who we are blessed be the name of the Lord every man every woman every boy every girl can live above sin can live above unbelief what is hindering the work of God in church or in our life it is unbelief amen but when we know we who we are the Bible tells us that those who are waiting for his coming they purify themselves we not going to make mistakes because as long as we in this flesh remember sometime back we read that quote as long as we are in this flesh we are going to make many mistakes but let us not be oppressed or put down by our mistakes amen like that song say that as long as the ransom Church of God is still here the precious blood of Jesus will never lose it his power amen if the church is here that blood is still working that blood is still active that blood has never lost in his strength the blood of Jesus will lose meaning after the Rapture amen when the church will be taken those will remain here they will have no more salvation blessed be the name of the Lord but as long as you still here and you believe that you're an elect of God as long as we are still here brother sister the precious blood of Jesus Christ is still strong as it was yesterday as it was 2,000 years ago blessed be the name of the Lord so let us claim that blood while time is still here praise the Lord now you are sons of God God has sons and daughters and God also has his people blessed be the name of the Lord there is a notorious Thug who was uh killed few weeks ago this man came in the media but here we are talking about the sons of God because the reason why this message came this message came to show us to reveal to us who we are amen we were in denomination thinking in fact we are just religious people we were religious sinners in our denomination in our churches there amen not until we came in contact with a message and the message showed us that we can live a holy life amen we used to read come out of my people out of blessed be the name of the Lord but when God sent Malachi 4 he revealed to us he help us to know who we are amen that you can be in a church when you are sinner you can even be a preacher when you are going to hell where will you get that only in the message blessed be the name of the Lord and that's what made us to come out of our Pentecostal churches in our and our denomination our religions our father's religion blessed be the name of the Lord because we realize that he for all this time we have been wasting our time you are being to church will not take you to heaven you are being to church will not take you for Rapture amen blessed be the name of the Lord there are people who grow up in churches until they even get married thinking that they are in the message when they are not in the message and it will be Terri by the way it will be so terrible for message Believers we are the people who will be so shocked when we miss rapture amen there are people who will not be surprised do you think pope of Rome will surprise to miss Rapture no he will not be surprised blessed be the name of the Lord do you think which doctors will be surprised no sir because where your theop is that's what influences you Amen brother sister how do I know that my theophany is in Glory by seeing my likes amen what do you say about serving God what influences you most blessed be the name of the Lord the Holy Ghost has never influenced somebody to go and smoke cigar praise the Lord hallelujah you are body you know it is in the message where the Prophet reveals to us that our Mansion is not like this building Yonder but it is our bodies our heavenly bodies our theop bodies Over Yonder amen that is your mansion and that is what influences you even when you in church how do you respond to the word blessed be the name of the Lord amen oh what a revelation when I was in the denomination I thought when we go to heaven we are going to find apartments there and everybody will own maybe an apartment car of thinking but the Bible says things of God they understood by the spirit of God amen and when God show you where you are when he show that Zeal in your heart when he saw how you loved him in your denomination he said no I will have to make a way that's why you never died in your mother's womb blessed be the name of the Lord that's why you have escaped many accidents because God wanted you to sit here today amen he wanted you to be among those who will be raptured he wanted you to be among those who will receive this message don't allow the devil discourage you just go and sit back just look at yourself brother you are testimony the devil will point you things which you have not received which you have not got yet but let let us be satisfied let us thank God for what he has given us now let us thank God for the life he has given us for this Mighty Revelation amen and after appreciating the bear and the lion testimony God is going to promote us blessed be the name of the Lord it is those little things which is going to make us move to obtain a bigger things but the devil always want us to overlook that if really God Is With Us brother that is none of your business I cannot force my daughter there to develop breast if I ask right now s doesn't just he just smiling but believer sometime we want to force things blessed be the name of the Lord but when we realize the working of God how God does his things amen God is low God is word the way God does his thing he does not violate nature God works according to the law of nature amen it is gradually blessed be the name of the Lord we are running the race but everybody is running at his pae as long as you in the will of God that is what matters brother sister let me tell you the rewarder who is standing at the finishing line is the Lord Jesus himself he will reward each one of us [Applause] amen the good thing with our Lord you know I remember when we were still uh when we were still in school uh not all those who participate in athletics they are given a reward from number one to number 10 rounds 2 rounds but thanks be to God not with our God if we keep the word of God God gives us the same reward amen and in this race we are running each one of us is going to be rewarded provided that we have kept the word amen so let us keep running blessed be the name of the Lord and what's going to keep us running is knowing Who We Are blessed be the name of the Lord way amen what am I trying to say we have to know who we are amen that is the strongest gear for us to move forward blessed be the name of the Lord let me give you this example a young man in the Bible who has his father for his inheritance and the father sold his portion and gave it to him and this the Bible says he went to a far country and he was there he enjoyed with girls with babes cassers with cheeks don't think that again brother sister there even people in the Bible but look at the end game blessed be the name of the Lord and some they have gotten chance to come back and repent but you may not have that chance amen he sold everything he enjoyed himself as long as he had cash as long as he was big wallet he had friends he could receive calls you know when everything is okay brother hey you'll be surprised hello God bless you bro yeah I was just checking on you wow oh what a moment promotion after promotion Victory after Victory blessed be the name of the Lord but this young man time came that's why I always say that there's no we need to try our best speaking to young men or our young children at home but when you are born a man child brother because time will come you don't even need your parent to tell you what to do hey amen because in man man is built with responsibility this young man after enjoying time came and now life was hard he had Amnesia Because by the time you get appetite for pig food rotten stuff full of marot but when he was there blessed be the name of the Lord amen I believe maybe it was one morning maybe that evening he was so angry to the extent that that day even maybe the boss never fed the pigs but something started to move inside him amen he had a strong throat he had a strong conviction in his heart which was unusual amen he had a restless night like Jacob praise be to God Jacob had good days he could play streaks and everything was okay but one day something happened to Jacob Jacob was not himself he had no peace amen he had no peace desperation was building in his heart and realize he was not at peace with laan Jacob maybe Jacob came and speak like she SP he spoke to the wife and told her you know what but that was not laan that was God Amen when God want you to move he will do something he will create a stuation amen when God want to to move from where you are he will create a situation there so Jacob's time for moving had come this young man brother amen that was pig food for your information yeah it was Hogs food km Hogs food food blessed be the name of the Lord that's why I always give that example this young man thought T every Christian time will come when you have to think twice amen because inside you there is a seed of God inside you you have a predestinated seed that's why even when Jonah was cast in the Well's Bell the world could not swallow him and when Jonah realized who you are when this young man realized who he was he said I will go back to my father even the servants they are much much better than us better than me here amen and God was watching in the message the prodal son amen by the day he left home his father never had peace in his heart every day every night maybe it became nightmare for her for him the mother was not happy amen the mother was troubled children most time they trouble their mother more than their fathers blessed be the name of the Lord amen when he knew he who he was he knew that the father was a king the father was rich the father had servant then said come and by and that's what God want from you amen it is a hard decision most the time to quit with that lifestyle but that is the decision God want amen every time God is waiting to see when is he making that decision blessed be the name of the Lord so when he made that decision God was happy one evening maybe it became the father's routine every evening was think about his son I wish this young man knew how I loved him maybe thinks that right now if he comes back there's nothing much for him but that was just something small I want him to First go and face the other side of the world what we [Music] amen the only Refuge is the word but outside the word blessed be the name of the Lord when this young man realized who he was that very day maybe the father was there the Bible says when he was there he saw him from a far distance then the father ran amen when man sin in Eden the same God was just portraying what he did amen that Parable shows God when man sin in Eden God was not happy amen God missed that Fellowship so he was there waiting but thank God for Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord and when he came praise the Lord he started preaching the gospel telling as the kingdom of God is at hand repent amen the way back is repentance if they only realize who you are you are Sons and Daughters of God hairs of the Kingdom right now we are kings claim your legal right don't let Satan press anything on you you you are of God the devil is pressing a lot on you he's showing you very many things even me by the way speaks to me but I'm here to tell the devil God is not finished amen he has not finished with us amen God has his Pace we are running at God's Pace not our Pace blessed be the name of the Lord when you grow a maze Garden if you grow a maze in a maze Plantation not all M mures at the same time God has a reason why it's like that amen but does it mean that the one that comes after the first fruit they are abandoned the answer is no we are in God's Garden amen the prophet say that we are different flowers in God's Garden we are different fruits in God's Garden they are those who mature us very first they grasp the word two three days one week one year they receive the Holy Ghost they're moving very fast that is their Pace blessed be the name of the Lord but all of us we are in the hands of God just know who you are just know that you are Christian know you a Believer know that the Holy Spirit belongs to you know that God gives it to his children amen know that God cares about his blessed be the name of the Lord amen in the message desperation the prophet say that if God uses desperation to squeeze to bring out the best of us blessed be the name of the Lord and he has got no right to hold it don't let sat press anything on you the devil can come and press something on you and make it so heavy on you until you think it's part of you but the Bible says whatever is not planted by God must be uprooted amen look at your life this afternoon what God has not planted uproot it by the word amen blessed be the name of the Lord because remember we are Covenant people when we receive the token God takes full full responsibility because we are finished good we are SE until the day of our destination until the day of redemption storms will come the prophet uses a good example like when good like for example let us use a trailer he seal maybe from mumbasa it is coming to Uganda they put there enough seal those good will reach when they are intact amen does it mean that they are not going to you mean those people in the sea they don't face storms those huge waves blessed be the name of the Lord it praise the Lord so my brothers my sisters when we realize who we are we come to know that we are not like others sister why do you why don't you put on uh this and that is because our church brother is not your because we know you know the word and you're doing what your father want amen so if we know who we are you know who you are I'm a Christian I'm I born again get over let me tell you I mean I believe we are different go and even God is happy when he sees that we know where we are standing he says I have children who knows that I'm their father amen he also brags about us who knows their responsibility who knows where they are supposed to be what they supposed to do and what they are not supposed to do amen every parent when he sees the son doing his will he becomes happy that's the same apply to our God because when you know who you are you cannot be deceived if you know that brother langa is your father I cannot convince that you are my daughter oh my son because you know you are dad amen praise be to God then why is the devil convincing some people that for me I can give you that ah I can give you iphon know but let God give you amen blessed be the name of the Lord God knows what is good for you and me amen God knows what is best for you and he will give you something which will not destroy you but if you give it to [Applause] yourself the very guy who gave it to you the very devil he will destroy you but let God let God's will be done in our life blessed be the name of the Lord because if we know that God is our father we know that he cares for us he hold Thousand Hills of cattle he's responsible of each and everything that happens around us there are many invisible forces which we may not see with our eyes amen sometime we Grumble because of the carnal the physical thing not knowing the invisible things the invisible forces which God we don't sometime we can't even imagine how many forces would have destroyed you you you wake up in the morning you bought a taxi you are going somewhere far you don't know even the mechanism how those wheels are running what holds those nuts you think is a spanner it is the grace of God and that's what God want us to know that's what God want us to do blessed be the name of the Lord you are Covenant people God tore Christ apart at Calvary making the Covenant swearing by himself he took the body up into heaven and will return someday but Christ he gave back to the church the same life that was in Christ Jesus is in the church tonight by the Holy Ghost doing and acting and Performing the same thing he did when he was here on Earth you receive it you have got the Covenant it is written to you swore by God you can't fail that makes the devil mad sure you can't fail God tear crust apart that on Calvary blessed be the name of the Lord men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little tring down something those are the Agents of the devil you know we are living the time where the devil is trying to devil evil worshippers brother sister the soal illuminatis and the drunkard all are devil worshippers but the devil try it is the same same devil the same demon operating in Witch is the same demon operating in Thief praise be to God so sometime the Devil comes and want to make the other one say what they are so bad even unbelief even church member is unbeliever because they don't believe the word of God blessed be the name of the Lord amen okay praise the Lord realizing and that's what's going to keep us going I was at school I knew that I'm a Believer there are things I did not do there are areas I did not go because I knew I was a Believer come to church knowing that you are believer you are coming to meet God Amen we don't come here to meet one another and just one another no sir we come here to have communion with God we don't come here for showing off we come to consecrate our life to become better citizen of Heaven blessed be the name of the Lord that's why when we come here we ought to have few stories but we mean business with God God the year is ending I still have this problem God help me in this area that's what God want to hear you've been at home and there's no change that thing has not gone where is the solution the solution is here amen let's be on our knees F bound to if each one of us everybody take his stand in the word B we convert we should convert spiritual gifts convert prophecy but prophecy not going to come when you on your there are believers who are busy playing praise be to God can the time you spent you know where your heart is where your treasure is that's where your heart will be if our treasure is in glory all our efforts going to be focused toward Glory praise be to God but if our treas on Earth whatever we are doing whatever we do it will be toward that praise be to God blessed be the name of the Lord yeah it's challenge to us those are the things we have to do challenge ourselves we give ourselves challenges the strength of the believer our strength is in the word our strength is in service our strength is in worship our strength is is in uh uh living a Christian Life that is our strength amen worshiping God that is our strength we are not like brother we are not ordinary human being and that is true we are not ordinary human beings blessed be the name of the Lord we just need to know and that if you read the figures in the Bible what helped those people to overcome was knowing who they are yes sir they knew where they were standing that's why Paul say that what will separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus he knew that his Sol Foundation was Christ Jesus amen and all things he spoke about he was saying what will separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus will it death poverty hatred praise be to God the same applies when you reach to your death bed it is it is that point but when we know where we are standing at least we be sure in fact we must be we must be sure of where we are going when we are still sober you know that scri that say that remember your creator in the day of your youth for evil days are coming amen there are evil days coming for each one of us as long as the Rapture delays those days are coming but the Bible tells us remember the day of your youth he say that when the keeper of that house will [Music] tremble at least let us live the rest of our life in service for God praise be to God I never have Club but I don't regret I don't regret brother sister I'm honest to begin with I can only tolerate this the sound at church blessed be the name of the Lord booing uhuh I don't great because I not boo Running With God I don't regret I'm now getting I'm now growing getting even older I think blessed be the name of the Lord but what kept me is because I knew where I was standing and what is keeping the church is the church to know their stand in the word praise be to God Amen you have a tag on you the devil knows it very well everywhere you go you are the target of the enemy that's why you have to know where you are standing tell J there is no soldier who goes anywhere and is not conscious of what he is when he hear the blood is shot the first thing he has to First investigate whom are they looking for why was that blood shot and after he solve the problem you see blessed be the name of the Lord there are people in the government there are people in security whom the government consider to be an asset maybe billions of doar blessed with the name of the Lord but even in God's kingdom brother sister we are God's ass said we are Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ amen the most Precious Blood that's why every wherever we go God is watching us God's eye moves all over the world Amen what God is watching you there's an eye following you and me because God knows what happened on Calvary he teared Christ apart he's only begotten for your sake amen why do you what about tomorrow why do you care about ABC D God is responsible he takes full responsibility because before we were born God arranged for each one of us our duty is only to find out the will of God for our lives praise be to God it doesn't mean that you're going to make me but the moment you learn the will of God that settles it amen there is somebody who owns US amen God owns each one of us he take care of us many time we we we we we get worried but I always wonder have you ever worried wor ask yourself you go in the Saloon or you go in the buba shop then you shave your hair but I've never met one brother who's worded brother I have shaved of my hair I don't know whether it will grow you just know it will grow it is automatic and that's how God want us to be to leave the rest to him and relax do your part leave the rest to God blessed be the name of the Lord all the heroes of the the Bible what troubled them most was they wanted to figure it out they try to ask for explanation like Gideon how we going to make it how we how are we what and here God comes say ahh you g on you might man of Val he was just like it was like a sprank making him to know who he was blessed be the name of the Lord the same thing happened to the disciples when Jesus was taken from them they were beaten after the day of Pentecost they were beaten they were trying to scare them but the Bible says they went and locked thems in the room and prayed then you know what the Bible says after prayer the Holy Spirit came down the house Shook and they were encouraged and when they came out of that house they were no more cowards amen because they knew that God was with them and what trouble us most is is because we don't we are not sure whether God is with us so but I'm here to assure you that God is with you if you can just believe that from the word of God that God is with you that settles it in whatever you are doing God is responsible of you God takes for responsible God said that that a suling mother can forget a child but not with God I have never read anywhere maybe I'll try to Google that the scientist knows how much how much hair you have on your head but he says that he knows the numbers of hairs on your head this God I don't think whether there is any statistics that knows the number of SC the number of stars in the galaxy but God says I know each one of them and I call them by their names God knows each one of us he even call us also by our names God knows you are home blessed be the name of the Lord God is so concerned about the course you are taking at the University he's so concerned about the point you are going to get he knows your address amen God knows our address but sometime we think in human nature it is possible sometime things happen but brother sister thanks be to God that in inside our heart there is something there is a voice amen some calls it a feeling but I call it a voice and that is the voice of God that is the Breath of God Amen inside your soul that keeps encouraging you sometime you wake up in the morning and you feel like you not coming to church but there is that voice inside your heart heart that tells you boy it is getting late for church that is the voice of God sometime you think you even you fallen off the grace that is the devil I always tell you that you don't need somebody else to tell that your father does not love you brother en can I is it possible for me to convince you that your father does not love you you say this brother is even crazy and the devil is crazy because that is his work he comes your father does not love you your brother does not love you your husand does love you your does not love you that is the work of the devil can you believe that believe that physically but Spirit you believe brother sister God loves you that's why even he gives you the Holy Ghost because he loves you amen God loves us God knows this Fellowship that's why you are here amening the word God knows about our youth meeting amen that's why God is working on it blessed be the name of the Lord let us just us know that we are children of God that's why the messenger came because if the prophet never came then who would have not known these things blessed be the name of the Lord we used to say it is okay you can dress the way you want but here the word of God com say no you cannot dress the way you want because you are somebody's property amen there's someone who takes full responsibility of you blessed be the name of the Lord you can act the way you want it's my right the child will say it's my right at home but not it's not your right to step on that to stand on that your father's table is your right to be a son yes but not to do everything is you are right you are my son but not to break my laptop even God has no go areas for each one of us it is your life indeed but you don't have right to put what God has not want want you to put on this on that life it's my right to put on artificial nail that is not your right as a Believer amen and you know sometime you know the devil is so cunning they put on arici nail and again they cut on this one why don't you just leave this one it grows it outow BR you see conscious there's one person I met and I wondered I even got scared the way she does and when she was something and it is their right you know the devil is full of Rights rights but when it comes to God God dictates God dictates over his children you do what he says you to do blessed be the name of the Lord and if we do his will ah he gives us everything but the devil gives you what you don't want to destroy you and when he see you going just like young people you are told by your mom don't do this don't do that there's one family I know I personally spoke to those girls and he was like but today it's prity blessed be the name of the Lord when it come to our young sister you are obligated to obey your mother provided our parents word is good is as good as our pastor's word every single advice you are given by your pastor if you don't follow it brother believe me you will realize that and you will remember very well that very Point that's why the prophet say that man takes himself to Hell God sends the prophet he comes with a message you say no he send the Evangelist he send the teachers he send the pastors and he said no it's my right it's my right our church my Bishop but if we know who we are that now we are the children of God what God want and what God detest and we walk accordingly in Joshua he say that if you keep my commandment and you devate not from it it shall be well with you all the days of your life not only for a day a year a week but all the days of your life and that's why God spoke to Joshua and told him be strong and be courageous as I was with Moses shall I be with you but there was a condition if you keep my commandment and Jesus said if you love me we shall keep we have to keep his commandment he says commandment is light is easy his yoke is light amen may God help us may God help us I know but may God give us the grace it says here that curs not a therefore your confidence which had a great recompense of reward do not cast your confidence and our confidence is in the Lord as I'm finishing say that they may be repudiated there may be question indeed to human Minds and they may not even seems to qualify nevertheless they are the messenger for the age God uses Abraham he lied listen to something here he used Moses he rebelled Jonah disobeyed Samson sinned David murdered he also used Joshua and Joseph and those with severe blemish for outnumber those who his who his stories seems to be perfect all way all and are none dare any that he used them by and through the holy spirit that they may put within them uh that he put within him them you see I don't think that God sister God can use you so God can use you it's just knowing that it is God working not us working he said that comment was written and when Paul wrote Abraham's commentary he never mentioned one thing about Abram's unbelief no no no no never was even accounted for him he said Abraham struggled not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong and giving praise to God Abraham did not look at his weaknesses he looked at the strength of God the ability of God the calling of God he never even called himself but God called him but because God called you you never asked you never went to God God called me called me no he found you where he called you so since God called you God has full responsibility of you because he knows blessed be the name of the Lord you know the story of Abraham but here he says the commentary was given that he never staggered at the promise of God in the message show us the father and it will sair he say that the life of God is in you and his and he's adopted you and you are sons of God you were for ordained for a Son of God you were in God before the foundation of the world and you only manifest only manifested in this day for his honor and Glory Not For Shame God manifested us this day for his honor and Glory the same power that spoke the world to existence is in those people that got the Holy Ghost now you see if we get the Holy Spirit the same power is in US son and daughters of God will create them a world blessed be the name of the Lord It's just knowing may God help us may God reveal to us these things we have an identity sanctioned by God before the foundation of the world God knows that I have a group of people who are in days of the Voice who are going to make it for the Rapture if you doubt that I believe it 100% that in this church we have candidate who are going to make it for the rapture and it is my desire and my prayer that may God help each one of us to work on our salvation with fear and trembling amen oh what a joy we have been taken for the Rapture blessed be the name of the Lord may the Lord bless you [Music]
