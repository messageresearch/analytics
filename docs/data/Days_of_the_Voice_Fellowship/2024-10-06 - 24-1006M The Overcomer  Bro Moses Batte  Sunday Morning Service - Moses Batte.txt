thatth and hearth from the book of law Lord we have already gotten the blessing we pray that you may Lord continue speak to us Lord as more in the name of Jesus render powerless all the evil spirits

Christ help my interpreter Lord God Almighty let all the glory and honor be brought back to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen so God bless you so much uh you may take your seats hallelujah amen so I'm so grateful once again glory be to God Amen uh to be that I'm going to speak to you people the purchase of the Lord Jesus Christ so I'm going to speak this morning on the Overcomer glory be to God amen amen amen yeah the prophet preached a message which he called titled how can I overcome praise the Lord amen so I'm here to tell you that we are fighting a de a defeated fellow praise the Lord amen and I want to tell you there is nothing that a devil can do in this last days was already defeated do you believe that Hallelujah the weapons of mass mass destructions are here all the weapon destruction they all here glory be to God am so I want to tell you I'm a winner either way glory be to God if I die or if I live I'm a winner either way I'm here to tell you we are winners because it was already declared in the scriptures that you are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus God cannot speak that before he sees the end of the battle God declares a winner from the beginning Hallelujah so he said through Paul you are conquerors in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen why because God Amen saw the end from the beginning glory be to God that's why the prophet says if the devil tries to remind you of your past when when he tries to remind you of the past amen amen what you do you should also show him end glory be to God amen hallelujah amen Point him tell him preach to him okay tell him you have preached to him to me I was once this I was I was this and okay let me also preach to you let me give you a sermon do you know the Lake of Fire do you know the Lake of Fire it is waiting for you praise God so we are going to speak about un Overcomer picking my inspiration from that message how can I overcome praise the Lord amen how can I overcome amen amen because just like I've told you that all the materials whatever you need From Here to Eternity it is with you hallelujah amen I always tell my church I tell the people that before God delivered the children of Israel before bringing them out of Egypt God prepared whatsoever they need in the journey out to the promised land it was already there God was ready hallelujah amen all the materials all the equipments whatever that is necessary to take them to the promised land was there Hallelujah so it was about his people toze them hallelujah amen praise God amen amen amen so when God begins a work hallelujah amen finishes it actually God finishes the work from the start amen hallelujah amen that's what the Bible says look unto Jesus the the and a finisher of our faith is the one who begins and is the one who finishes glory be to God Amen so if you want to become an overcomer what you must do is just one thing take your eyes take your eyes from all things and look unto Jesus amen there is a message which was preached in our days which was titled Look Away to Jesus it means take your eyes away from all things and look away unto Jesus for the Au and the finisher of our face if you can do that you'll be an overcomer in any way hallelujah amen because the battle is not yours neither mine hallelujah amen but the battle is is of the Lord glory be to God Amen so I'm going to speak about that picking my inspiration that message how can I overcome hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen because everything was laid before us here all the materials are here no excuse everything to defeat that Devil Is With Us Praise the Lord amen amen I always tell people that the problem we are facing amen sometimes we have weapons but we don't know how how to use them just imagine a policeman having a gun amen and he being chased by somebody with a with with a bon with a stick praise the Lord amen he has a gun but he doesn't know amen how destructive it is praise the Lord with a gun you don't have to get close to to the enemy you can shoot it's a long range praise the Lord am but somebody with a stick has to get close to you now look at the policeman running running from somebody who is having a stick hallelujah amen so I believe what we are having is even more than a God glory be to Jesus so we are Overcomers in either way praise the Lord if we can if we can learn how to place how to utilize praise the lord we are Overcomers amen amen so we are talking about that now we have seen in the scriptures here Book of Revelation where the Lord says behold I stand up a door and knock any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come in to him and will sh with him with me amen Amen to him that overcomes will I gr to sit with me in my throne even also as I overcame praise the Lord amen so the prophet tells us that the Lord was speaking to this last age this age isan Church Ag and God was rebuking this age praise the Lord amen because it's the age where the Lord speaks when he outside of it it's out of the church and he rebuking it from outside and he speak and is's calling amen he's telling knocking whoever hears my voice and hallelujah amen If any man hear my voice open the door I come into him and will with him and he with me God is Not yearning to enter into the church as an AG pray the Lord Desiring to enter into the temple Hallelujah if you hear my voice it is a singular it's not a plural If any man hears My Voice Hallelujah and opens for me I will enter hallelujah it's an individual glory be to God to hear the voice of the Lord and to open for him he will enter in he will sh with you and thou sh with him hallelujah amen and he said unto him he said unto him praise the Lord to him this is a personal thing praise the Lord amen so that's how the Bible is written in this age glory be to God and you know very well when the Lord was when the Lord was dealing with a with with with the Jews he deals with the Jews as a nation hallelujah amen but when it comes to the Gentiles God deals with us as an individual not as a group that's why he says he that Hearth my voice he that Hearth me Hallelujah he that overcomes it is an individual one person amen amen I will grant to sit with me with my throne in with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father he overcame he overcame that's why he SE in the how many desire to sit in the must be an overcomer there is something that you must fight must F to amen so the Lord fought and he overcame in verse 22 says he that has an ear one person he that has un let him hear what a spirit says unto the churches churches are many but one person praise the Lord amen and the prophet preached the message the five definite identifications of the True Church of the Living God hallelujah amen and it told us what the church is what is the church hallelujah amen and he said the church is the called out one that called out one that church is the called out one ated and is made different praise the Lord amen that is the church the called out one separated made different for the service of a certain Kingdom hallelujah amen so that's what the church is it's an individual Affair hallelujah amen it's an individual Affair it's not a group Affair and it says when God before he call the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt they were called his people but they were not the Church of God but when they came out of Egypt and they got into the Wilderness then God called them the church why because they were called out they were separated from the thingss of Egypt to serve God so they became the Church of God and God was now giving them his instructions when they were still in Egypt God could not there is no way God could give them instructions because they were mixed up the Egyptians are giving them their orders Hallelujah their Traditions their cultures hallelujah amen so it was hard for them to grasp the word of God so God had to separate them and put them in a place where they separated where God can give them his instructions where they were called The Church of God were call the Church of God in the desert praise the Lord now when it comes to us the Gentiles it is different God does not deal with us as a group God deal with you as an individual so we can as well say when you're still in the world that is Egypt there was an influence upon you the influence of the world was upon you Hallelujah God wanted to make you a different person so God had to bring you out he had to separate you from Egypt Hallelujah to the Wilderness amen amen you know Wilderness Wilderness represent sanctification praise the Lord amen so I have to call you out and sanctify you praise the Lord amen to make you different amen because you have become a church now that called out one separated and made different Hallelujah to serve in the kingdom of God praise the Lord am so if you get that Revelation do not serve God as a group glory be to God Amen Hallelujah for example now if God comes and he says in this place I'll take one person who would be that person some people say Pastor maybe maybe brother M because the way we see him the way he walks with the word I think he's the one who is worthy to be taken glory be to God Amen but I want to tell you me I cannot give it to the pastor I can't give it to brother I can't give it to any sister if God is coming to one it is I it is I because a Church of God who was called out amen hallelujah amen so now that teaches me that when it comes to serve God I not serve God under the influence of a group amen am if we come here in the church and the song leader say let us worship God hallelujah look at Brother Martin whether is worshiping worshiping or is not worshiping Hallelujah not be influenced by him I will worship why because I am the called out one I am the separated one if it comes to support the work of God not look where so is supporting is not supporting how support because I was [Applause] called I'm a called one I'm a separated one to Ser the kingom glory be to God amen amen amen when it comes to worship when it comes to give I'll not look at one I'll look at myself if something is not going well in the church I not look at Brother s look at sister s is my responsibility because God will require it amen praise the Lord that is the right way to understand the word of God hallelujah amen praise God it's an individual affair now here in the prophet says now this is not a church that building is not a church this place tomorrow it can become a bar hallelujah amen but what makes it a church is because there is a gathering of the called out on Hallelujah am you gather here that attitude that I am called by God to Ser the kingdom of God we create an atmosphere here we create the Heavenly atmosphere we feel at church amen hallelujah amen glory be to God Amen and I want to tell you if you come here with a strange atmosphere Hallelujah you can spoil the the whole thing that's why the prophet said Hallelujah if you can come with a pill of Fire e to one an individual so tonight I'm speaking to an individual I'm not speaking to to all of you I'm speaking to one person glory be to God now it's up to you position [Music] yourself in in in the right Channel hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen because I always say I always tell people you see the weddings we conduct Amen in the wedding praise the Lord amen there is a it has a group of people amen the mes best p boys the peg boys flower girls the flower girls and even Theo Lord amen they are all in the same what praise the Lord but that wedding is not for all of them it is for the two people it is a day of two people the groom and the bride so when it comes to to loocking we are not going to call the all in we are going to call only two people the bride and the groom praise but these ones are all escorts it's the same thing it depicts our journey some people put their focus upon the mat upon the Grooms men upon the flower girls and they never put their focus upon the groom and the bride praise the Lord hallelujah that's why the Bible says 2 million came out of Egypt but only two married to the prom what is that one in a million yes sir so the Bible is addressing to one person to an individual I pray that you you you make your you you you you you become that one person amen amen glory be to God amen hallelujah amen yeah praise the Lord hallelujah so the Lord said amen he say that uhing amen amen whoever hears my voice and opens I'll come in glory be to God Amen I'll come in and S with him amen and I want to tell you uh the scripture I told us here he that overcomes he that overcomes oh gr to sit with me in my Throne he that overcomes Grant him to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down in with my father in his throne that is the reward of the edge that is the reward of the Overcomer in this last age in every age God has promised a reward but I've been looking through those rewards and have not seen the greatest reward that he has given us in this last age do you know that it is the greatest do you know that it is the greatest reward of all ages and I was wondering why did God from such a great reward to the last age hallelujah amen because if you look at the age of Paul the reward was to eat from the Tree of Life hallelujah amen if you come to the age of su you shall not be hard of the second death Hallelujah in the you shall eat of the Hidden Manner and you shall be given a white sto glory be to God Amen now when we come to amen I give you power over Nations then we come to sad I'll give you a rainment amen when we come to Philadelphia he says I'll make you a pillar in the temple of my father glory be to God there shall be a pillar glory be to God that will St reward because a pillar it is one of the thing that hold a building glory be to God am so they shall be made pillars amen amen now when it comes to the ede [Applause] of he says I'll make you sit with me sit with me in my thr not you not you shall not be a pillar not to be a partake of Tree of Life Hallelujah not be given a white stone but you shall you shall sit it with me in my Throne just like I overcame so the age ofation it is the greatest age it is the age which is rewarded with the greatest reward to sit with the Lord in his throne to re with him Hallelujah so you must be ready to overcome if you are train how many want to sit with Jesus Hallelujah when you speak of that you are meaning I'm ready I'm ready to do anything necessary to overcome this age so that I can sit with him amen are you ready for that there is a woman who came to Jesus the mother of zebede and he said Lord will you allow my I I pray I request you that uh in your kingdom you let my two sons one to sit on your left and another one on your right hallelujah amen and Jesus said it's not me to to to to do it hallelujah amen but are they ready to take of the cup to be baptized the way I shall be baptized praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen you may think of you may think of being yes I be baptizing in water Jesus name is okay but this kind of baptism was different amen through suffering we enter the kingdom of God are they ready to do it yes and Jesus said they might they might be they do it but it's not it's not for me to do it to give it praise the Lord amen so uh if you say that you want to be uh to get reward you want to with Christ Hallelujah you signing your meaning I'll go all the way I'll do whatever necessary and I'm here to enourage you pray the Lord you will do it if you determined Hallelujah will you will do it if you can determine in your heart it depends on on your determination amen because all our fathers they made it we have examples the Bible shows us we have a cloud of witnesses cloud of witnesses amen so many examples there are so many and they watching over us we are in an arena we are in an arena praise the Lord so are there Spectators the angels are watching over you the Moses are watching over you amen the cloud of witnesses watching witnessing amen praise the Lord amen amen how are you going to play it how are you going to play it yeah the devil also has his the other side and God has his praise the Lord amen they also cheer Cheer Up cheer up brother cheer up sister I overcame that you can overcome it I overcome it you can overc it glory be to God so there is a cloud of witnesses so don't fear you will overcome it all the weapons all the requirements whatever you need in this journey to overcome the devil it is with you hallelujah amen I may not finish my preaching pra the Lord because it's a long one Hallelujah am but I'll do what God will enable me to do and I believe we shall we shall be blessed hallelujah amen now uh this last age it is the age where we have a great reward amen am to sit with our Lord in the throne to with him hallelujah amen praise God Amen and I've been wondering why why did God made it so why did he made this reward to be so great because you knew things that are packed in this last age it is the end of all things praise the Lord amen I want to tell you the thing that you're fighting the devil that you're fighting this is a fighter who fought from Eden throughout Noah's age glory be to God so we are not fighting with an amateur Hallelujah we are fighting with an timer praise God Amen you're fighting the Oldtimer but I'm so glad Hallelujah that we are not alone for us the one is on our side the one is on our side the one who is on our side Hallelujah amen is the amen so fear not fear not the Lord is with you fear not the battle is not yours is of the Lord hallelujah amen so we are fighting with a veteran praise the Lord amen but the one is on our side is more [Applause] higher it's more greater it's more powerful he above everything hallelujah amen I'm so glad to know hallelujah amen s when God looked in his store maybe let me call it the arm praise God Amen he went he looked through them say now this weapon will fight in this age this one will fight in this age this one will fight in this age this one will fighting this age God alloted them that [Applause] way Hallelujah I'm so glad that when God looked in his arm he saw that you can put your name Hallelujah will be a good weapon to fight in the last [Applause] days so he appointed me he appointed me to be the last days hallelujah amen and the prophet said if the Lord asked me which age would you desire to be in in the age hallelujah amen when Noah was building the ark I would say no in the age when Moses plagues to Egypt Hallelujah am and when Moses separated already SE I say no my Lord should I put in the edge where the Lord was walking on the earth when I was in the flesh walking and Open the Eyes he would say Lord I wish to be there but I wish to be this last age Hallelujah why because it is the grandest of all ages it is the Golden Age it is the age where eternity with time that is the desire praise God amen hallelujah amen amen amen so I would speak together with my Prophet Lord I also wish to be in this age Hallelujah am because it is the closing of time hallelujah amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so Church of the Living God in this age God chose the best fighters you see you watch the walls amen America we he of America Russia those great countries amen I want to tell you they cannot unleash their dangerous weapons amen amen when the battle is still in this kindergarten praise the Lord amen they cannot release them not only nuclear but they have weapons no nuclear is I think it is the highest because it destroys the whole thing but they have weapons like uh hydogen bombs yes those ones I believe nuclear is the last thing yeah it is the last but there are some others amen for the example I can give like people people can write don't expect the government to bring those no they bring theg amen the MERS the plastic bullets rubber bullets and things but let us be invaded by another country that's when you know that you has been having all this in the praise the Lord so it is what God is doing at the last time the end of the battle he releases the best so you are the best in the of God Hallelujah that God has chosen you get what I'm saying amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so you are the best in the armor of God and God has has has uh has has has prepared a great reward amen amen so the prophet says here but when we come here we are here for one specific purpose are you here for that one specific purpose this is the house of collection this is the throne this is the Throne of God and judgment gospels from the house of God and here is where we come together Gather in [Music] love with one another as only Christians can love but in here we are under the leadership of the spirit of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is a man us and we are here to take recording among us to see where our short places are praise God amen hallelujah amen where our short places are our shortcoming and how can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be and that's what that's what we study Minister study those places for their people when they see the people they lack when they begin on that that is the duty of a minister when he looks at A Flock and sees where the luck is he goes to God and seeks for inspiration Hallelujah and he brings it glory be to God hallelujah amen so and he looks for what to feed those people now soon I think that the church maybe should be taken just a little step step higher glory be to God amen amen I don't I don't plan on doing it this morning of showing the things but I think the Lord willing before we preach on these trumpets I want to bring the church just something that you should know and believe now you believe that this is the need of the hour Hallelujah am let me tell you church we must always look in the word of God and examine where we are and know where we supposed to be praise God Amen know the need of the hour praise the Lord amen and now we are speaking on this overcoming the word overcome of course you know what it means you've got to have something to overcome you've got to have something to overcome and this church agge the Holy Spirit was rebuking about atan church age as have just been through it it needed a rebuking had to be rebuked because of its IND different towards Christ it had put Christ outside in their age and Christ was on the outside trying to get back on the inside that is love after he had been put out of his his own house he was trying to come back and said that he that open the door I'll come into him the church itself in Hall had put him out now I already say this Christ getting out of the church it was not his wish hallelujah amen because the Bible tells us is walking in the midst of the seven candlesticks hallelujah amen so his wish is to be with the church but there are some circumstances that forces him out of the church praise God amen hallelujah amen are you give this example when if you want to chase a Muslim out of your house when if you want to chase a Muslim you don't have to quar with him don't waste your breath you you know what you do just go buy a qu and you display put it somewhere I want to bet you that will be the end of shake coming to your house praise God it is the same with our God God loved so much to keep in the church but there are some conditions that forced him out now you understand what I'm talking about praise the Lord amen so there are some abominables which were brought in the church and God could not bear with them and stepped out glory be to God Amen so what keeps God in the church is Holiness righteousness if you accommodate sin in the church you are telling God please leave us alone and leave us with our sin and you know what God do will not go very far will not go very far because he has that love he has that love he stands outside whoever hears he comes out of that Tommy root [Applause] and meet the Lord Lord have heard your voice now this last age it is not the edge of Jesus saves and Jesus heals no praise the Lord I believe some of you have seen the for us we go out every Sund we reach out the gospel we preach amen come out of her the gospel for today is not Miracles it's not Jesus saves and heals hallelujah amen the gospel of today come out my people Babylon Babylon is falling come out so that you should not be partakers of our sin that is the gospel for today calling out people out of denominations come and meet Christ because the system is rotten it is dead it cannot be revived God is calling out people hallelujah it is an exodus we are in the of hallelujah amen glory be to God am and even in the message Church there must be an exodus hallelujah amen to those to those who are from the denomination and they entered into the message and the message has become also something so God is calling out those he says come the come theer out of because amen amen however much we claim we are notan we are not in amen amen that's what we say hallelujah amen but when you get in the message Church you see the spirit audition dominating so God is saying come Out Come the [Applause] higher that is the rapture hallelujah amen come the higher come out of laition come out of the kindergarten come here come higher and the Bible says when I looked in heaven that is chapter four of Revelation I saw an Open Door what is the open door the Propet says Jesus Christ is that opens the door to the sheep for because I said I'm the door she fold Hallelujah am so you come out of and you go higher what do you see you see Jesus you walk with Jesus it is a time of Walking With Jesus it is a time we in the of Enoch praise the Lord amen because Enoch was the seventh from Adam to Enoch the seven but you know what en did defied the law of death why because he came out of that age he looked what as what all his papers have gone through this praise the Lord amen when it came to Enoch the seventh the bride in the seventh age hallelujah amen he said now to escape this I must go higher I must go higher Hallelujah and the Bible says walked with God Genesis 5 think from 23 had children had a wife praise the Lord amen but the Bible says Enoch walked with God praise the Lord amen and Enoch walked with God this age Des age of coming higher amen and following Jesus praise the Lord amen those who follow him there are you are going to defy def the law of death praise God Amen it nowhere decided I will walk with a prce of life when we walk with the Lord in the light of his world while Glory sh we do his good will he abides with us [Music] still and with all who will trust I love that Hallelujah so Enoch decided to walk with him in the light of his word and shed the glory he walked with God until death could not come near feared Enoch it did not fear Enoch it feared that God was with amen you you you are all aware of that nevered wherever he could go for the funeral flee Hallelujah so decided to walk with the one the of life so when death came to reach Enoch it saw the brightness of God and said no no no no no and Enoch pleased God he pleased God and the Bible says God took Enoch God said I cannot leave my faithful servant my child we have become friends when God was going oh yes now you the are [Applause] inam you are not Adam age you are not in's age you are in en's the age of translation and Enoch saw it and he prophesied the Lord come through the thousands he saw you saw me so it is an age of Walking with God glory be to God so the age of put God out amen amen amen now even you you can put God out of your life or you can retain him praise the Lord amen amen amen praise the Lord amen how but you might put her with that [Music] pork praise the Lord amen amen amen so that man can come hallelujah amen now with God if you want to have him there are things that you must lay aside is you to become an overcomer because you can overcome as you walk with him praise the Lord amen that two canot together unless they agree that is 22 that walking two walking together it can be like this I'm walking I'm following my brother why I put his step that's why I put we are in agreement so now God is leading us hallelujah amen so if you want to walk in agreement with him why he puts his step that's why you put your step that is walking in agreement with God two cannot walk together unless they agree Hallelujah am that's what did but for us some of us we want to walk in according to our wish and we expect to get the same results you cannot do so hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen so listen to this amen amen the prophet says here

Lord he wronged God so many times he WR until he lost the sight so the sight means the vision he lost the vision of which he was called to amen amen but he played with sin he played with sin until he lost the vision you can play with a sin until you lose the vision Hallelujah am when I got saved I had a vision praise the Lord amen but along the way the devil tries to divert if you continue with him even lose the that's what happened to Samson but Samson when he was in the prison he was always regretting this thing has put me in this [Applause] dungeon I'm supposed to kill the pH but now I'm grinding meal for them praise the Lord amen but the Philistines did not recognize that hair were growing samon was repenting some of you maybe you want God to put you somewhere in the corner that's when you repent but God doesn't want it that way hallelujah amen it's good you do it hallelujah amen so Samson lost the site now the time came of making spot the Philistines the Devils can you imagine Satan to put you that law the child of God who was to serve God and now you are entertaining Devils but when Samson realized samon and he was brought into the arena all the the fighters the of the Philistines they were drunk their wives are drunk there was a lot of Applause and Samson realized I was called for the purpose now see where I am hearing the uplo the laughing and of the drunkards and among those people there were some people were discuss of samon one some even lame because of Sam but today samon is being brought to entertain said no Lord Lord hallelujah amen and samon told the L because could not even lead himself you can get to that state where you cannot even lead yourself you cannot even pray you cannot even read the the Bible you cannot to church hallelujah amen and he said take me to the pillar which is holding this and after run for your life and Samson was hallelujah amen and the boy took him to the column which is holding the and he said boy run for your life and Samson knelt down and said Lord just one more time give me Grace to avenge for my two eyes Hallelujah and God had a pray of Sam Samson was restored and he started to push the pillar which is holding the building and his people thought is just playing because they were drun and they were laughing shook the pillar and the pillar started shaking they became desperate but was finished the time was no more hallelujah amen and the building all of them and the Bible says Samson killed many people in his death than those he killed when he was alive and the prophet said some people they don't want to be like Samson Hallelujah am they want their enemies to die but not them to die but Sam prayed Lord give me Grace give me strength to die with my enemies to avenge for my two eyes so I'm
