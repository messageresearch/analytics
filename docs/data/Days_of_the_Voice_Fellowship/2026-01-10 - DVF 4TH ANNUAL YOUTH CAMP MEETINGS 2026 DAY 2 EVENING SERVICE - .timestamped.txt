[33:16] Amen.
[33:18] As I told you yesterday
[33:21] uh some few years ago
[33:25] when I was in uh
[33:28] Benoni, South Africa,
[33:32] you know, we had some little fellowship
[33:33] with uh pastor Maher
[33:37] and we were speaking about you know our
[33:39] generation.
[33:42] He's my senior by about three years and
[33:45] so we are the same age group. And we're
[33:48] speaking about our generation and the
[33:50] message and
[33:53] how uh you know there's a a changing of
[33:56] of the baton and
[34:00] and you know I told you my thoughts he
[34:02] told he told me his thoughts
[34:05] and I felt
[34:07] this is a man that had a real burden
[34:11] for our generation.
[34:13] So I told him right then
[34:16] that I'm going to invite you for our
[34:18] youth camp.
[34:22] We thought I I thought it would be the
[34:23] second youth camp. It didn't work out.
[34:27] But this one the Lord just placed on my
[34:30] heart and
[34:33] and uh I felt this was the right time
[34:38] and and I believe it was no mistake
[34:41] and I would like us to just be expectant
[34:44] as we have been. The Lord has already
[34:46] been moving.
[34:49] This is a man with one of um uh the
[34:52] fastest growing churches down in the
[34:54] south.
[34:58] I know many already know been following.
[35:00] I was just talking to one of the young
[35:02] people in the church. He said he has
[35:03] been following his ministry and
[35:07] but there are also those who do not know
[35:09] him for you
[35:11] to know the calib of money. He is
[35:14] someone with a backbone
[35:17] to say what the tape says
[35:21] and to to preach what brother Bham
[35:22] preached.
[35:24] I thought what kind of person should we
[35:26] invite?
[35:29] We really want just the message to be
[35:31] preached.
[35:34] I hope you are under expectation.
[35:38] We're not really limiting the time.
[35:42] This is our last service.
[35:44] We have an expectation for our time, but
[35:46] you know, we put no limits.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; And so I'm personally under expectation.
[35:55] So, uh, Pastor Maher
[35:59] from Benoni, South Africa,
[36:02] &gt;&gt; please come and take over. God bless
[36:04] you.
[36:16] God bless you.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:21] You appreciate God.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; You're happy to be here.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Uh do you know the song? Amen.
[36:36] Let's let's try that one.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; The Kenyans are not happy. I didn't sing
[36:42] it in Kenya.
[36:44] I didn't sing this sign.
[36:47] Um
[36:49] someone told me please I beg pastor ask
[36:53] pastor Maha to sing that song. I was
[36:56] supposed listen I was supposed to ask
[36:58] you but I forgot.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; So this must be the spirit.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; So
[37:04] if
[37:06] if he had sang a song inviting me I was
[37:08] not going to sing.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; But now I have to sing.
[37:16] Amen.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[41:26] I greet you once more in the name of our
[41:28] Lord and Savior.
[41:34] I'm very happy to be here.
[41:38] I sing when I'm happy.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; We appreciate God for the servants of
[41:46] the Lord that has preached before me.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; We appreciate Pastor Mike.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; We appreciate brother Joshua.
[41:59] They did a a good job
[42:03] &gt;&gt; and uh I was so delighted.
[42:08] I told Pastor Mike that I'm not happy
[42:10] with him.
[42:14] Yesterday he preached I was very happy.
[42:17] I was blessed
[42:20] because he's my countryman.
[42:23] Deep down I was bleeding.
[42:29] And this this morning he repeated the
[42:31] same thing.
[42:34] and and the way he was smiling when he
[42:36] looks at me
[42:40] is like he knew exactly what he was
[42:42] doing.
[42:45] But uh nonetheless,
[42:48] it's a gift of God.
[42:51] And when you see something being done
[42:52] and being done properly,
[42:56] it does something to you.
[42:59] And brother Joshua didn't preach like a
[43:01] white man at all.
[43:05] I realized there's a black man in him.
[43:09] He was all over the shore.
[43:12] He was a real blessing.
[43:15] We look forward to a time where both of
[43:16] them will come to South Africa.
[43:20] South Africa and be a blessing to us.
[43:23] I know I was I was sort of speeding
[43:26] yesterday.
[43:28] I'll try and be slow.
[43:32] something happens along the way
[43:34] and if it happens forgive me
[43:38] I I wish to just take it step by step.
[43:43] Uh you know I had to rearrange certain
[43:46] things
[43:48] and rearrange and re IS ELOHIM.
[43:53] HE SAYS BUT THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH.
[43:56] SO WHEN JOHN LOOKS BACK,
[43:59] HE SEES ONLY UP TO THE FIRST CREATION OF
[44:02] GOD.
[44:04] THE FIRST THING EVER TO BE CREATED
[44:08] WAS THE LIGHT,
[44:10] NOT THE SU.
[44:13] But the light, the logos,
[44:16] THE PILLAR OF FIRE,
[44:18] THE EXPRESSION OF THE INVISIBLE FATHER.
[44:23] BUT WE HAD A GREATER THAN MOSES IN THIS
[44:26] DAY.
[44:28] WE HAD A GREATER THAN JOHN THE REVELATOR
[44:30] IN THIS DAY.
[44:32] HE WENT BEYOND THE BEGINNING
[44:36] AND HE WENT BEYOND THE CREATION OF THE
[44:38] PILLAR OF FIRE.
[44:41] HE SAYS LET US GO BEYOND THAT.
[44:45] LET US LOOK AT GOD
[44:48] BEFORE HE WAS GOD
[44:50] WHILE HE WAS STILL ELLA ELOHIM.
[44:54] WHEN HE FILLED ALL TIME, MATTER AND
[44:56] SPACE,
[44:59] HE WAS THE SELFEXISTING ONE.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANAM
[45:04] DID NOT ONLY DESCEND THE MINDS OF MEN.
[45:09] WHAT MAKES HIM THE GREATEST PROPHET
[45:12] IS HE WENT BEYOND MAN. HE DESCEND THE
[45:16] MIND OF GOD.
[45:18] HE SAYS I CAN SEE GOD
[45:21] IN HIS IMAGINARY MAKEUP.
[45:24] HE BEGIN TO THINK AND SAY
[45:27] WHAT IS HE LOOKING AT? THESE ARE NOT YET
[45:30] WORDS
[45:32] BECAUSE THE PILLOW FIRE IS NOT CREATED
[45:34] YET.
[45:36] HE'S SEEING THAT THOUGHTS OF GOD.
[45:39] HE SAYS HE BEGIN TO THINK AND SAY
[45:42] LET THERE BE LIGHT.
[45:44] IT'S NOT THE LIGHT OF GENESIS 1. HE'S
[45:48] THE LIGHT OF GENESIS ZERO.
[45:51] HE SAYS, "AND I SEE A LIGHT PROCEED OUT
[45:53] OF HIM."
[45:55] HE SAYS, "IT IS CALLED BY THE THE BY THE
[45:58] THEOLOGIANS
[46:01] OF TODAY THE LOGOS."
[46:04] HE SAYS, "I CAN SEE HIM
[46:07] DANCING BEFORE THE FATHER'S DOOR
[46:10] LIKE A SON."
[46:13] THAT IS THE FIRST THING EVER TO BE
[46:15] CREATED.
[46:17] IS THE SON OF GOD,
[46:19] THE EXPRESSION OF THE FATHER.
[46:22] BUT AT THIS LEVEL
[46:25] IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE NATURAL EYE.
[46:28] THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO TAKE A TRIP.
[46:32] YES. BEFORE MATERIAL EXISTENCE
[46:35] IS ONLY VISIBLE
[46:37] TO A PROPHETIC CLASS
[46:41] with prophetic INSIGHT
[46:44] AND THE ABILITY TO OBSERVE
[46:47] AND DECODE THE SUPERNATURAL.
[46:50] IT IS THE PILLAR OF FIRE.
[46:53] NOTHING WAS MADE
[46:55] OUTSIDE OF THAT LIGHT.
[46:58] WHAT LIGHT? THE PILLOW FIRE LIGHT.
[47:02] HALLELUJAH.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S GENESIS 0.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; AND GOD ALLOWED CLINKERS TO BREAK OFF OF
[47:10] HIM.
[47:13] CLINKERS WERE BREAKING OFF.
[47:16] HE CREATED THE SUN. IT WAS BURNING AND A
[47:19] BURNING
[47:21] AND OUT OF IT CLINKERS WOULD BREAK FORTH
[47:26] AND HE WOULD LOOK AT THEM IN IN ETERNITY
[47:29] AND SEE THEM FALLING.
[47:32] HE WOULD ALLOW IT TO GO TO A CERTAIN
[47:35] DISTANCE.
[47:37] AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME, HE TELLS
[47:40] IT TO STOP. HE SAYS, "YOUR NAME IS
[47:42] MASS." HE ALLOWS ANOTHER ONE TO GO.
[47:46] HE ALLOWS IT TO STOP. HE SAYS, "YOUR
[47:49] NAME IS JUPITER." HE ALLOWS ANOTHER ONE
[47:51] TO GO. HE ALLOWS YOU TO STOP. HE SAYS,
[47:55] "YOUR NAME IS PLUTO."
[47:57] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S WRITING THE FIRST
[48:00] BIBLE.
[48:03] AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT BROKE OFF
[48:08] AND IT WENT VERY FAR. BUT SOMEHOW THE
[48:12] PILLOW OF FIRE
[48:14] INTEREST IN THIS ONE,
[48:16] SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ONE THAT HE LIKES
[48:19] ABOUT IT, BUT IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE
[48:22] SUN.
[48:24] SO IT GOT THAT COLD.
[48:27] IT BECAME A BALL OF ICE.
[48:31] BUT THE LOVE OF THE FATHER
[48:34] IN THAT LITTLE CLINKER
[48:37] FOLLOWS IT TO THAT DIRECTION.
[48:40] WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
[48:42] PREDESTINATION.
[48:44] THE CLINKER DID NOTHING TO DESERVE TO BE
[48:47] LOVED.
[48:49] BUT THE LOVE IS ALREADY THERE. THERE'S
[48:53] SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT. THOUGH IT
[48:55] HAS WANDERED AWAY FROM THE SU N.
[49:01] THOUGH IT HAS WANDERED AWAY FROM THE S,
[49:05] THE SON HAS LOVE FOR IT.
[49:08] HE TAKES A HOLD OF IT
[49:10] &gt;&gt; AND HE STARTS BRINGING IT BACK. HE
[49:13] STARTS BRINGING IT BACK. HE REALIZED IF
[49:16] I PUT IT CLOSE TO PLUTO,
[49:18] IT BECOMES TOO COLD FOR IT. IF I PUT IT
[49:21] TOO CLOSE TO MARS,
[49:24] IT BECOMES TOO HOT. BUT IT MUST BE TOO
[49:27] NEAR BUT YET TOO FAR IN THE RIGHT
[49:30] POSITION DISTANCE TO THE SUN.
[49:35] WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT ONE?
[49:37] IT'S CALLED
[49:40] YOU AND ME.
[49:42] WE WANDERED AWAY FROM GOD. WE WERE GOING
[49:46] TO GET TO PLUTO.
[49:48] BUT GOD SAID NO. HE PREDESTINATED YOU
[49:53] AND HE STARTED BRINGING YOU BACK, BACK
[49:56] TO THE WORD,
[49:58] BACK TO THE HEAT, BACK TO THE MESSAGE.
[50:02] AND WHAT HAPPENED?
[50:04] THE ICE
[50:07] THAT HAD GATHERED AROUND THE EARTH
[50:10] BEGAN TO MELT
[50:13] FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO
[50:16] &gt;&gt; DOWN TO AANAS
[50:18] DOWN NEAR TO THE BOTTOM OF SOUTH AFRICA.
[50:21] IT STARTED TO SEPARATE
[50:24] TO ALLOW THE EARTH THAT WAS HIDDEN BY
[50:26] THE WATER
[50:28] TO BE IN THERE. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM
[50:31] SAYS, "NOW WE ARRIVE
[50:35] AT GENESIS 1.
[50:37] IN THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED
[50:41] THE HEAVENS
[50:45] AND THE EARTH AND THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT
[50:48] FORM
[50:49] AND DARKNESS WAS UPON THE FACE OF THE
[50:51] DEEP.
[50:53] BUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS WERING
[50:58] UPON THE WATERS.
[51:00] OH, GLORY TO GOD. THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS
[51:05] OFFERING
[51:06] &gt;&gt; UPON THE WORD UPON THE WATERS.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT SPIRIT?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE LOCOS.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; WAS IT JESUS?
[51:18] YES. JOHN SAYS IT
[51:23] THE PILLAR OF FIRE MADE FLESH AND DWELT
[51:27] AMONGST US. THAT'S WHY ONE DAY WHEN THE
[51:31] DISCIPLES CROSSED OVER
[51:33] JESUS SAID I'M FOLLOWING
[51:36] BUT THE SPIRIT BROTHER SAYS IF THE
[51:39] SPIRIT
[51:40] &gt;&gt; OF BEETHOVEN
[51:42] &gt;&gt; IS IN YOU WILL DO WHAT BEETHOVEN DID.
[51:46] THE SPIRITS OF SHAKESPEARE IS IN YOUR
[51:50] YOU WRITE PLAYS
[51:52] AND YOU WRITE BOOKS
[51:55] AND IN THE PILLOW OF FIRE
[51:57] JESUS CHRIST IS SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT HE
[52:01] DID IN GENESIS ONE.
[52:03] WHAT DID HE DO? THE SPIRIT HOVERED UPON
[52:07] THE WATERS.
[52:09] JESUS DID NOT NEED A BOAT.
[52:13] THE SPIRIT IN JESUS COULD NOT SINK IN
[52:16] WATER
[52:18] IN GENESIS
[52:20] EVER SUNK IN WATER.
[52:22] SAY AMEN SOMEBODY. AND IF THE SAME
[52:25] SPIRIT THAT RAISED UP CHRIST FROM THE
[52:28] DEAD
[52:30] IN YOU, THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF
[52:35] THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF THIS YEAR THAT
[52:38] SHALL DESTROY YOU. WHEN THE DEVIL COMES
[52:41] LIKE A
[52:43] SPIRIT OF GOD, RAISE UP
[52:47] A LITTLE.
[52:56] Satan is in trouble.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; If the devil doesn't know what TO DO
[53:04] WITH YOU,
[53:06] HE WILL touch the things THAT SURROUND
[53:08] YOU.
[53:10] YOU touch the pierces,
[53:13] YOU TOUCH THIS, YOU TOUCH,
[53:15] BUT ME HE CAN TOUCH.
[53:18] FOR THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
[53:20] CAME ROUND ABOUT
[53:22] THEM THAT FEAR HIS
[53:27] AMEN.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Tonight I feel like preaching.
[53:34] Hallelujah.
[53:36] Hallelujah. Pastor said, "Don't bring
[53:38] your tired self."
[53:44] That was a zodiac.
[53:47] The first Bible
[53:50] names were written in there.
[53:53] I'm not preaching on that,
[53:55] but one day I'll preach about it.
[53:59] AND OUT OF THE ZODIAC
[54:01] WAS A TRANSLATION.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; THE PYRAMID
[54:06] &gt;&gt; IS A TRANSLATION
[54:08] OF THE ZODIAC.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Isaiah 19:19
[54:20] Isaiah has got 66 books like the 66
[54:23] books of the Bible.
[54:28] It starts with the story of Genesis and
[54:30] it ends with revelation in the
[54:31] millennium.
[54:39] 1919 it says
[54:43] it says IN THAT DAY
[54:46] SHALL THERE BE AN ALTAR
[54:49] &gt;&gt; TO the Lord in THE MIDST OF THE LAND OF
[54:51] EGYPT
[54:55] PILL AT THE BORDER THEREOF TO THE LORD.
[55:01] You seeing that
[55:04] EGYPT
[55:06] &gt;&gt; WAS THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.
[55:10] AND GOD SAYS, "THERE SHALL BE AN ALTAR
[55:16] OF THE LORD IN THE MIDST OF THE LAND OF
[55:19] EGYPT.
[55:22] AND THIS ALTAR
[55:24] SHALL BE A PILLAR
[55:27] AT THE BORDER THEREOF OF THE LORD."
[55:33] And he says 20, "AND IT SHALL BE A SIGN
[55:38] AND FOR A WITNESS UNTO THE LORD OF HOSTS
[55:42] IN THE LAND OF EGYPT.
[55:47] FOR THEY SHALL CRY UNTO THE LORD BECAUSE
[55:49] OF THE OPPRESSORS,
[55:53] AND HE SHALL SEND THEM A SAVIOR,
[55:56] AND A GREAT ONE, AND HE SHALL DELIVER
[55:59] THEM. THIS ALTAR
[56:03] &gt;&gt; AT THE CENTER OF THE EARTH
[56:05] &gt;&gt; IS A PILLAR IS A WITNESS
[56:09] IS A SIGN THAT IS SPEAKING OF JESUS
[56:12] CHRIST.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS THING IS THE PYRAMID OF
[56:17] ENOCH
[56:20] IS THE PYRAMID OF KOPSY.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE STUDIED ARCHITECTURE THEY
[56:26] CALL IT THE PYRAMID OF KOPS.
[56:32] WHICH IS TRANSLATION TO THE PYRAMID OF
[56:36] ENOCH.
[56:39] THIS PYRAMID
[56:41] IS A TRANSLATION OF THE ZODIAC
[56:46] IS A SUMMARY OF THE GOSPEL IN THE
[56:49] HEAVENS.
[56:54] A PYRAMID IN EGYPT
[56:57] &gt;&gt; naturally
[56:59] is is is a tombstone.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; It's a it's A IT'S A BURIAL PLACE.
[57:11] BUT THIS ONE
[57:14] IS NOT LIKE THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT,
[57:22] &gt;&gt; YOU FIND THE SARCOPHAGUS,
[57:26] THE THE THE SARCOPHAGUS WHERE THEY BURY
[57:29] THE KINGS,
[57:32] they are treasures.
[57:35] BUT THIS ONE, IT HAS TWO CHAMBERS
[57:41] WHERE PEOPLE COULD BE BURIED.
[57:44] IT HAS GOT A CHAMBER WHICH THEY CALL THE
[57:46] BRIDE'S CHAMBER
[57:50] OR THE QUEEN'S CHAMBER.
[57:53] AND you ascend
[57:56] IN THE GRAND GALLERY
[58:00] AND THE GRAND GALLERY
[58:03] HAS GOT SEVEN STEPS.
[58:07] NOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO COUNT THE STEPS
[58:09] AS THE TREADS THAT WE USED TO CLIMB UP
[58:11] HERE,
[58:14] YOU'RE GOING TO CONFUSE YOURSELF
[58:16] BECAUSE THOSE ARE NOT THE STEPS THAT WE
[58:18] COUNT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PYRAMID.
[58:22] THE SEVEN STEPS IS THE ROCKS THAT HAVE
[58:24] BEEN PILED ONE AFTER THE OTHER
[58:29] WHICH THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGY UP TILL
[58:32] TODAY
[58:36] 10 January 2026
[58:40] THAT CAN EXPLAIN
[58:43] HOW THAT TYPE OF A ROCK
[58:47] COULD BE CARRIED THAT HEIGHT
[58:51] STACKED TOGETHER IN THAT PRECISION
[58:56] on site.
[59:00] BUT
[59:01] ON SIDES ON ON THAT PLACE WHERE WE ARE
[59:04] MOVING.
[59:05] NOW
[59:07] THERE IS NO TYPE OF STONE LIKE THAT
[59:12] WITHIN A RADIUS THAT IS REACHABLE BY A
[59:15] VEHICLE.
[59:19] YOU HAVE TO CROSS THE SEA.
[59:22] TO GET THAT TYPE OF GEOLOGY
[59:26] THAT SHOWS WHATEVER TECHNOLOGY WAS USED
[59:32] WAS BEYOND THE TECHNOLOGIES OF TODAY.
[59:36] Seven steps
[59:39] takes US INTO THE KING'S CHAMBER.
[59:42] BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THE KING'S
[59:44] CHAMBER,
[59:46] THERE IS WHAT WE CALL THE GODS.
[59:49] THESE ARE THREE HUGE BOULDERS
[59:53] THAT PROTECT THE KING'S CHAMBER.
[59:57] BUT THE THE CONSTRUCTION WAS DONE IN
[59:59] SUCH A WAY
[1:00:01] ARCHAEOLOGIST HAD TO BREAK IT TO WANT TO
[1:00:04] ACCESS THE KING'S CHAMBER.
[1:00:10] EVEN AFTER YOU BREAK IT, YOU CAN'T ENTER
[1:00:13] INTO THE KING'S CHAMBER
[1:00:16] WHILE YOU ARE STANDING UPRIGHT.
[1:00:19] YOU HAVE TO BOW YOURSELF DOWN
[1:00:22] BECAUSE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THE KING'S
[1:00:24] CHAMBER.
[1:00:26] AND WHEN YOU ARE IN THE KING'S CHAMBER,
[1:00:28] THERE IS A LITTLE PORTION THAT IS BUILT
[1:00:33] WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO
[1:00:34] CONTAIN A A A COFFIN OF SOMEBODY,
[1:00:40] BUT INSIDE THAT THERE'S NO COFFIN.
[1:00:43] THE MEASUREMENTS OF THIS LITTLE THING
[1:00:47] IS THE EXACT MEASUREMENTS TO THE ARK OF
[1:00:50] THE COVENANT.
[1:00:54] AND THERE WAS A BROTHER
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; CALLED BROTHER GREEN.
[1:00:59] BROTHER GREEN
[1:01:02] IS THE ONE WHO SANG
[1:01:05] DOWN FROM HIS GLORY.
[1:01:07] WHEN BROTHER BRHAM WAS COMING TO PREACH
[1:01:09] THE UNVEILING OF GOD,
[1:01:13] BROTHER BRHAM TOLD BROTHER ANGRY,
[1:01:17] YOU HAVE SANG WHAT I'M ABOUT TO COME TO
[1:01:19] PREACH ABOUT.
[1:01:21] BROTHER BRHAM WAS COMING TO PREACH THE
[1:01:23] SEVENTH SEAL
[1:01:25] AND BROTHER ANGRIM
[1:01:28] CAME TO BROTHER BR.
[1:01:30] THIS IS IN THE BOOK GENERATIONS.
[1:01:34] IT'S A COMPILATION OF THE TESTIMONIES OF
[1:01:35] BROTHER.
[1:01:38] HE SAYS, "BROTHER BRANA,
[1:01:40] I WENT TO SEE THE PYRAMID OF ENOCH
[1:01:45] AND THERE IS NO HIEROGLYPHICS.
[1:01:49] THERE'S NO EGYPTIAN WRITINGS.
[1:01:53] ALL OTHER PYRAMIDS HAVE GOT EGYPTIAN
[1:01:55] WRITINGS IN THEM
[1:02:00] TO SHOW THEY WERE BUILDED BY EGYPTIANS.
[1:02:05] BUT THIS PARTICULAR PYRAMID
[1:02:08] HAS no hyographics.
[1:02:12] BUT AS WE WENT TO THE SEVENTH STEP,
[1:02:16] THE LAST STEP THAT USHERS US
[1:02:20] INTO THE KING'S CHAMBER.
[1:02:22] THERE WAS A LITTLE WRITING
[1:02:25] AND I ASKED THE TOUR GUIDE.
[1:02:28] I SAID, "WHAT IS THIS?"
[1:02:31] AND HE SAID THIS IS APRIL 1909 0906 1909
[1:02:45] HE SAYS THERE'S NO WRITING
[1:02:49] IN THE ENTIRE PYRAMID. BUT BROTHER,
[1:02:52] BROTHER, YOUR BIRTHDAY
[1:02:55] IS RECORDED
[1:02:58] IN THE PYRAMID OF
[1:03:02] WE GET INTO ETERNITY,
[1:03:06] WHICH IS THE KING'S CHAMBER.
[1:03:11] THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT I COULD HAVE
[1:03:12] BROKEN DOWN,
[1:03:15] but it would have been nice if I put it
[1:03:17] on a table.
[1:03:20] I started this when I was studying.
[1:03:24] You would have enjoyed it, but it would
[1:03:27] have been a lecture.
[1:03:29] Today, I'm not a lecture. I'm to preach.
[1:03:33] So, let's pause.
[1:03:37] How many are with me so far?
[1:03:41] SO, THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING
[1:03:43] INSIDE OF THIS PYRAMID.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; THE MATERIAL
[1:03:49] THAT ARE USED IN THE MAKING OF THE
[1:03:51] PYRAMID.
[1:03:54] THEY ARE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL. SOME OF
[1:03:56] THEM
[1:04:00] THOSE THAT STUDY TECHNOLOGY
[1:04:04] THEY SAY TESLA'S LAW
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE TRANSFER OF
[1:04:09] ELECTRICITY WITHOUT CABLES
[1:04:15] WIRELESS TRANSFER OF ELECTRICITY.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; THE PRINCIPLES
[1:04:22] DRAWS THEM FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
[1:04:24] PYRAMID.
[1:04:29] IT CAN'T BE A LIE
[1:04:32] BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS
[1:04:34] IN THE MESSAGE OF THE STATION OF A
[1:04:36] PERFECT MAN
[1:04:39] THE STATION OF A PERFECT MAN
[1:04:43] LIKE A PYRAMID
[1:04:45] AND HE SAYS YOU MUST BE BUILT
[1:04:50] TO BE A STATION OF THE PERFECT
[1:04:54] WORDS YOURSELF SITTING
[1:04:57] YOU ARE PART OF THE PYRAMID.
[1:05:00] AND HE SAYS, "I'M NOT HERE
[1:05:04] TO BUILD A CHURCH, NOR TO BUILD AN
[1:05:07] ORGANIZATION,
[1:05:09] BUT I'M HERE TO BUILD THE INDIVIDUALS
[1:05:13] SO THAT THEY CAN BE A POWERHOUSE,
[1:05:17] A DWELLING PLACE OF HIS SPIRIT
[1:05:21] TO SHOW THAT A PYRAMID
[1:05:24] IS A DISTRIBUTION POWER OF POWER.
[1:05:29] PYRAMID.
[1:05:33] YOU ARE A SOURCE OF POWER.
[1:05:37] YOU ARE A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY.
[1:05:41] THAT'S WHY BROTHER
[1:05:44] CAME AND PREACHED THE MESSAGE. THERE'S A
[1:05:47] MAN HERE WHO CAN TURN ON.
[1:05:52] WHERE IS THE LIGHT? THE LIGHT IS SITTING
[1:05:55] HERE.
[1:05:56] BROTHER, BROTHER, WHEN HE HAD PREACHED
[1:05:59] THE CHURCH HES
[1:06:01] THROUGH THE SEVEN CHURCHES
[1:06:04] AND HE PUT LOUDIA
[1:06:06] IN GROSS DARKNESS
[1:06:08] AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE CAME DOWN IN.
[1:06:14] IT WENT TO THE BACK OF THE TABERNACLE
[1:06:17] AND STARTED THROWING
[1:06:20] SUDDENLY WHAT BROTHER HAD DRAWN.
[1:06:26] EXACTLY.
[1:06:29] BUT ON THE SEVEN CHURCHES,
[1:06:33] BROTHER PUT TOTAL DARKNESS.
[1:06:36] THE PILL OF FIRE CORRECTED THAT.
[1:06:39] HE PUT A LITTLE LIGHT THERE.
[1:06:47] THERE SHALL BE LIGHT.
[1:06:49] WHEN BROTHER COMES, HE SAYS THERE'S A
[1:06:52] MAN HERE WHO CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT.
[1:06:56] LIGHTS.
[1:06:58] YOU AND ME,
[1:07:00] BROTHER SAYS,
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; "THE EVENING LIGHTS
[1:07:05] ARE HERE IN UGANDA,
[1:07:07] UGANDA, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ONCE CALLED
[1:07:10] DARKNESS.
[1:07:12] BUT AFTER THE PREACHING OF THE MESSAGE,
[1:07:15] WE HAVE MOVED FROM DARKNESS
[1:07:19] AND WE HAVE BECOME TO SAVE THE LIGHT OF
[1:07:22] THE WORLD.
[1:07:24] THE WORLD WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT.
[1:07:27] THEY SEE YOU.
[1:08:08] Let's put our hands together for
[1:08:15] must catch these things.
[1:08:18] WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU.
[1:08:20] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS NOTHING ELSE
[1:08:25] BUT A STORY ABOUT YOU.
[1:08:28] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU, BROTHER.
[1:08:31] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU, SISTER.
[1:08:34] THAT'S WHY EVEN WHEN WE SING THESE
[1:08:35] SONGS,
[1:08:37] WE PUT OUR NAMES IN THERE,
[1:08:40] WE ARE NOT WORSHIPING MEN.
[1:08:42] COME ON NOW. WHEN HE SAID, "LET US MAKE
[1:08:46] MAN IN OUR IMAGE." HE WAS TALKING TO ME.
[1:08:51] I CONTRIBUTED
[1:08:53] IN THE CREATION OF MYSELF.
[1:08:56] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? YOU WERE THERE UNTIL
[1:09:00] ONE DAY WAS A MAN BY THE NAME OF JOB.
[1:09:04] YOU WENT INTO AMNESIA
[1:09:07] WHO YOU ARE
[1:09:10] UP YOUR
[1:09:12] ANSWER ME LIKE A MAN.
[1:09:14] WHERE WERE YOU?
[1:09:17] WHERE WERE YOU? THE MORNING STARS.
[1:09:23] THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOY
[1:09:27] 26.
[1:09:30] I HAVE AN ANSWER
[1:09:33] QUESTION. I WAS THERE WHEN I WAS
[1:09:37] CREATED.
[1:09:39] I WAS THERE WHEN THE DEVIL WAS CREATED.
[1:09:43] I WAS THERE WHEN HE WAS KICKED OUT OF
[1:09:45] HERE.
[1:09:48] Can you say amen?
[1:10:08] TO RESPOND TO THE MESSAGE OF
[1:10:11] IT. HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:55] CHURCH.
[1:11:06] HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:08] SAY AMEN.
[1:11:10] It's natural to you.
[1:11:28] HEY,
[1:11:45] I THINK GOD HIMSELF
[1:11:49] KEPT THE PYRAMID OF KOPSY
[1:11:53] AND IN THE BOOK OF ISAIAH.
[1:11:56] IT SAYS IT'S A PILLAR,
[1:11:59] WHICH MEANS IT'S A MEMORIAL.
[1:12:02] A PILLAR IS SOMETHING THAT STANDS OVER A
[1:12:04] LONG TIME.
[1:12:07] IT SAYS IT'S AN ALTAR.
[1:12:11] IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A PLACE OF
[1:12:12] SACRIFICE.
[1:12:16] IT SAYS IT'S A WITNESS.
[1:12:20] IN OTHER WORDS, IT TELLS A STORY.
[1:12:24] WHAT STORY DOES IT TELL?
[1:12:27] TELLS A STORY
[1:12:29] THAT ONE DAY,
[1:12:31] EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE PYRAMID,
[1:12:34] THERE ARE WATER LINES
[1:12:37] and marks.
[1:12:45] THE BIBLE SAYS, "PRESENT YOUR BODIES
[1:12:50] A LIVING SACRIFICE."
[1:12:53] YOU HAVE A STORY TO TELL.
[1:12:56] CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; THEY CANNOT BE GLORY
[1:13:01] without a story.
[1:13:06] They cannot BE REIGNING
[1:13:09] WITHOUT CHARACTER.
[1:13:11] KNOW YOU NOT
[1:13:13] KNOW YOU NOT. YOU ARE A TEMPLE. YOU ARE
[1:13:17] A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND ONE DAY,
[1:13:22] SATAN EVEN TRIES IT.
[1:13:25] TO DESTROY YOUR BODY.
[1:13:27] HE COMES AGAIN
[1:13:30] AND COVERS THAT PART.
[1:13:32] HE SAYS, "IF THIS EARTHLY
[1:13:37] BE
[1:13:41] WAITING ALREADY
[1:13:47] IN THE HEAVENS
[1:14:20] AMEN.
[1:14:22] TELLING them this means that
[1:14:26] this means that.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; So these are the truths
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; that has been lost throughout the ages.
[1:14:37] So he's telling them the fruit in the
[1:14:40] garden of Eden.
[1:14:43] A GOD
[1:14:46] is not a cheap subject.
[1:14:50] It's not A CHEAP SUBJECT.
[1:14:53] IT SOUNDS SO CHEAP
[1:14:56] TO SAY IT'S ONE GOD
[1:14:58] WHO OPERATES IN THREE OFFICE. BUT IT'S
[1:15:01] not as simple as that.
[1:15:33] AS TO US A SON
[1:15:36] IS GIVEN
[1:15:38] AND THE GOVERNMENT
[1:15:41] SHALL
[1:15:42] AS IN THE FUTURE WHEN HIS BODY IS A SON
[1:15:47] WHEN HE'S BORN AS A
[1:15:49] BUT IN THE FUTURE, THE GOVERNMENT SHALL
[1:15:52] BE UPON HIS SHOULDER.
[1:15:55] THE SHOULDER
[1:15:57] IS THE BODY PART
[1:15:59] WHICH IS THE BRIDE, THE CHURCH
[1:16:03] BECAUSE HIS BODY IS THE CHURCH.
[1:16:06] CHURCH IS THE MYSTICAL BODY OF THE LORD
[1:16:09] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:16:13] And his NAME
[1:16:16] WHEN HIS BODY IS NOT CALLED
[1:16:19] LATER
[1:16:21] SHALL BE CALLED
[1:16:23] WONDERFUL
[1:16:26] MIGHTY GOD. HE IS NOT BORN GOD
[1:16:30] BUT HE SHALL BE CALLED.
[1:16:32] WHY? BECAUSE MALACHI SAID, "SUDDENLY,
[1:16:38] SUDDENLY SHALL THE LORD ENTER INTO HIS
[1:16:41] TEMPLE."
[1:16:44] THE TEMPLE THAT MALACHI IS TALKING ABOUT
[1:16:48] IS NOT THE TEMPLE OF ZERUBBABEL.
[1:16:51] THE TEMPLE IS TALKING ABOUT IS THE ONE
[1:16:54] THAT JESUS SAYS, "DESTROY THIS TEMPLE
[1:16:58] IN THREE DAYS.
[1:17:00] I WILL RAISE IT UP." THAT'S WHY THE
[1:17:04] BIBLE SAYS WHEN HE COMES TO JOHN
[1:17:09] AS A LAMP
[1:17:11] BECAUSE THE EGG CELL AND THE SPERM CELL
[1:17:13] WAS BOTH CREATED BY GOD.
[1:17:19] BUT JOHN S WHEN YOU SEE THE HOLY GHOST
[1:17:25] DESCEND LIKE A D UPON HIM
[1:17:28] AND FEEL HIM THEN YOU SHALL KNOW IN
[1:17:32] OTHER WORDS EVEN JOHN DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL
[1:17:35] THAT DAY AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND JOHN
[1:17:39] SAYS THERE GO
[1:17:41] TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD
[1:17:46] DOING WHAT WAS JOHN DOING PREACH
[1:17:49] TEACHING COLOSSIANS 2
[1:17:52] WHICH SAYS AND THE FULLNESS
[1:17:55] OF THE GOD
[1:17:57] DWELT IN HIM
[1:17:59] BODILY.
[1:18:01] YOU ONLY HEAR ABOUT ONE STORY
[1:18:04] WHEN HE'S AT THE AGE OF 12
[1:18:07] DEBATING WITH LAWYERS,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; DEBATING WITH LAWYERS OF THE WORD,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; THE DOCTORS OF THEOLOGY.
[1:18:19] AND FOR THE NEXT 18 YEARS,
[1:18:22] YOU HEAR NOTHING ABOUT HIM.
[1:18:25] THE FULLNESS OF GOD, FELT IN HIM, YOU
[1:18:29] START HEARING ABOUT HIM.
[1:18:32] GOD COULD NOT DIE.
[1:18:36] GOD CANNOT DIE.
[1:18:39] YES. SAY
[1:18:43] BROTHER SAYS
[1:18:45] JESUS DIED MORE A DEATH IN
[1:18:52] he did at the cross.
[1:18:55] WHY A DEATH IN?
[1:18:59] BECAUSE IT WAS IN GETHSEMANE
[1:19:02] WHERE THE FATHER
[1:19:04] SEPARATED
[1:19:06] WITH THE SON
[1:19:08] THE FLESH PART
[1:19:11] COULD GO AND BE CRUCIFIED.
[1:19:14] DO I HAVE EVIDENCE
[1:19:16] WHEN HE WAS ON THE CROSS
[1:19:19] AND HE IS BEING CRUCIFIED?
[1:19:21] THE BIBLE SAYS HE CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD
[1:19:24] VOICE.
[1:19:25] SAID
[1:19:30] WHICH IN TRANSLATION MEANS
[1:19:33] FATHER MY FATHER
[1:19:36] WHY HAS THOU FORSAKEN HIM WHEN HAD THE
[1:19:39] FATHER FORSAKEN HIM
[1:19:43] SO HE CAN DIE
[1:19:45] A SINNER
[1:19:47] CARRIED THE SIN OF THE WORLD
[1:19:51] IS NOT A SINNER
[1:19:53] YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
[1:19:56] AND WHEN THE BODY DIED,
[1:19:58] THE SPIRIT WENT DOWN
[1:20:04] IN PRISON.
[1:20:06] THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT I'M PREACHING
[1:20:07] ABOUT
[1:20:10] ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST,
[1:20:12] IT IS THE SPIRIT THAT IS PREACHING TO
[1:20:14] YOU TODAY.
[1:20:19] THAT'S WHY BROTHER SAYS IF HE COMES
[1:20:22] TODAY
[1:20:24] IN THE BODY OF MEN AT 33
[1:20:30] I WILL REJECT HIM. IT'S A DIRECT
[1:20:32] QUOTATION. HE SAYS IF JESUS COMES BACK
[1:20:35] TODAY
[1:20:37] IN THE BODY OF HORSEMEN AT 33
[1:20:41] I WILL REJECT HIM BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE
[1:20:44] PROMISE
[1:20:46] OF HIS COMING
[1:20:48] OF JESUS COMING
[1:20:50] WEARING A BLUE SUIT,
[1:20:53] A BLUE SHIRT, A RED TIE WITH AN ORANGE
[1:20:57] MICROPHONE AND PREACHES TO YOU KNOW I
[1:21:01] COME IN THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK
[1:21:05] IS WRITTEN
[1:21:07] GOD AND HE SAYS IT'S ONLY BY THE HOLY
[1:21:12] GHOST THAT YOU CAN CONFESS
[1:21:15] THAT JESUS
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; IS COME
[1:21:24] IS COME PRESENT AND CONTINUOUS.
[1:21:29] YOU MUST RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME
[1:21:33] AND ITS MESSAGE.
[1:21:35] YOU MUST RECOGNIZE
[1:21:37] JESUS OF TODAY. THAT'S WHY WHEN BROTHER
[1:21:40] PREACHED,
[1:21:42] HE DIDN'T PREACH WHO WAS THAT
[1:21:46] BECAUSE WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE
[1:21:49] MECH OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
[1:21:52] ABOUT WHO IS THIS MEC
[1:21:57] WHERE ISC
[1:22:00] PEOPLE ASKING WHERE ISC
[1:22:04] HE SAYS WELCOME TO THE UNVEILING OF
[1:22:09] WHERE WAS GOD? FAILED BEHIND THEM AND
[1:22:13] THEY DIDN'T CATCH IT AND THEY DIDN'T
[1:22:16] CATCH IT AND INVITED THEM AGAIN. HE SAYS
[1:22:20] THE MIGHTY GOD
[1:22:22] AND FAILED
[1:22:24] BEFORE US.
[1:22:27] AMEN. THE WORLD
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD IS AGAIN
[1:22:33] CONDITION AND THREE THINGS MUST HAPPEN
[1:22:42] MUST BE ON EARTH TO WITHSTAND THE
[1:22:44] PROPHET MOSES THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY WE
[1:22:48] HAVE A LOT OF PREACHERS THAT ARE TRYING
[1:22:50] TO IMITATE BROTHER
[1:22:53] THE SPIRIT OF JANICE AND J
[1:22:56] ONLY ONE AMEN. WHO HAS THE RIGHT
[1:23:00] TO DESEND THE HEARTS OF PEOPLE FROM THE
[1:23:06] being question?
[1:23:14] CAN WE SAY AMEN? NO PASTOR HAS A RIGHT
[1:23:17] TO DISCERN YOUR HEART.
[1:23:21] BROTHER SAYS THERE'S ONLY ONE IN AN AGE.
[1:23:25] HE HAS ONLY ONE ALSO IN A GENERATION.
[1:23:29] AND HE SAYS IN THE CHURCH BOOK, THOSE
[1:23:32] THAT LEAD OTHERS ASTRAY
[1:23:35] BIND THE PEOPLE TO THEMSELVES
[1:23:39] BY FEAR
[1:23:40] AND THEY OPERATE A GIFT WITH A MARGIN OF
[1:23:43] ERROR.
[1:23:45] IF YOUR GIFT IS NOT 100%,
[1:23:48] GO TO THE BACK ROOM OF THE CHURCH WHERE
[1:23:51] WE HAVE TO JUDGE YOUR PROPHECY. YOU
[1:23:54] CANNOT DESERT THE SHRINE OF CHRIST
[1:23:58] BECAUSE THAT'S THE MESSIANIC SIDE.
[1:24:03] I FEEL SOMETHING ON ME. I FEEL SOMETHING
[1:24:07] ON ME. STOP ME. YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
[1:24:11] WHOEVER CALLED ME, YOU CAN.
[1:24:13] I'M HERE BY THE MIGHTY ARGUMENTS OF
[1:24:15] CALVARY.
[1:24:17] ADVOCATING FOR THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:24:20] YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU MUST CATCH THE
[1:24:22] REVELATION OF HIS MERCY.
[1:24:25] WE ARE TYING THE TALES OF THE FOXES.
[1:24:29] WE ARE TYING THE TALES OF THE FOXES.
[1:24:33] WE WANT TO BEND CAMPALA.
[1:24:37] THE FIELD OF THE PHILISTINES
[1:24:41] MUST BEND
[1:24:43] AND YOU NEED AN EQUIPMENT.
[1:24:46] YOU NEED AN IGNITION
[1:24:48] OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT IS ALREADY IN YOU
[1:24:52] WHICH is the message.
[1:25:02] Say amen.
[1:25:08] Hallelujah.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; If I touched some nerves, forgive me.
[1:25:17] spoken with.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, I'm not sorry.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; We are trains to the message.
[1:25:35] trained man.
[1:25:37] I can take the message
[1:25:39] to others to hand it over to go and
[1:25:44] burn.
[1:25:45] This is not just a youth meeting.
[1:25:48] Gather here and get excited
[1:25:51] but want to TRAIN A PEOPLE
[1:25:54] NOT WITH a banana backbone.
[1:25:58] We are not THE SONS OF KISH.
[1:26:00] WE ARE THE SONS OF JACOB.
[1:26:04] SAY AMEN.
[1:26:06] ABRAHAM HAD 318
[1:26:09] TRAINED SERVANTS.
[1:26:11] ABRAHAM
[1:26:15] 318
[1:26:18] TRAINED IN THE HOUSE OF ABRAHAM
[1:26:21] AND WE ARE SERVANTS
[1:26:24] TRAINED IN THE HOUSE OF BRHAM
[1:26:28] to handle the SWORD OF THE WIND.
[1:26:35] Can you say amen?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; A mirror in the pyramid pyramid.
[1:26:48] SO HE FINISHES EXPLAINING
[1:26:53] THE THE INSCRIPTIONS AROUND THE PYRAMID.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM WAS HANDED A CROWVER.
[1:27:03] AND HE RIPPED THE TOP PART.
[1:27:09] AND HE SAYS THERE WAS A WHITE GRANITE
[1:27:12] ROCK
[1:27:16] WHERE NO SUN HAS EVER SHOWN. YES.
[1:27:21] AND HE TELLS THE MINISTERS,
[1:27:25] "LOOK ON THIS."
[1:27:28] THAT'S THE COMMISSIONER.
[1:27:31] ON THIS
[1:27:34] FOR I GO WEST
[1:27:37] TO CONNECT WITH THE ANGELS
[1:27:41] AND I WILL COME BACK
[1:27:44] THE INTERPRETATION
[1:27:47] OF THE WHITE ROCK
[1:27:50] BROTHER BUT YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING US A
[1:27:53] LOT OF THINGS
[1:27:55] WE WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN OUR NOTES
[1:27:58] WE FEEL LIKE WE WANT PREACH
[1:28:01] BUT THE COMMISSION IS DON'T GO LOOK ON
[1:28:06] LOOKING on the WHITE
[1:28:09] AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE HAVE BEEN
[1:28:12] LOOKING ON THE WHITE
[1:28:17] we have been LOOKING

[1:28:23] EYES ON THE MESSAGE SET YOUR EYES ON THE
[1:28:25] MESSAGE LOOK ON THIS LOOK AT PUSH

[1:28:39] UGANDA. UGANDA. LOOK ON THIS. LOOK ON
[1:28:42] THE MESSAGE.
[1:28:44] THERE'S A LIGHT
[1:28:46] THAT IS COMING.
[1:28:48] THE LIGHT COMES. YOU SHALL UNDERSTAND.
[1:28:53] WHAT'S THE SECRET
[1:28:56] BENEATH THE ROCK?
[1:29:01] Look on this brother.
[1:29:04] LOOK ON THIS BROTHER. LOOK ON THIS
[1:29:06] SISTER. AND THIS BROTHER BRANA WAS GOING
[1:29:10] UP AND DOWN
[1:29:14] IN THE VISION.
[1:29:16] HE SAYS, "I LOOKED AT THE CORNER OF MY
[1:29:17] EYE.
[1:29:19] I SAW BROTHERS FROM GEORGIA,
[1:29:22] MANY OTHER PLACES. THEY WERE EXCITED
[1:29:24] ABOUT THE INSCRIPTIONS.
[1:29:27] They said, "We don't know how long
[1:29:28] brother is going to take.
[1:29:32] Let's go AND START PREACHING ME. WE
[1:29:34] ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH. THEY ESTABLISHED
[1:29:37] MINISTRIES,
[1:29:39] BASED ON dos and DON'TS
[1:29:42] based on Old TESTAMENT
[1:29:48] UNTIL THE MESSAGE IS DEFINED AS PEOPLE
[1:29:52] WHO DON'T WATCH television
[1:29:55] and people who wear long dresses.
[1:30:02] WE ARE KNOWN MORE FOR WHAT WE DO NOT DO.
[1:30:07] THAN WHAT WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE
[1:30:10] BECAUSE IT'S MEN WHO TOOK THE
[1:30:12] INSCRIPTIONS AROUND
[1:30:15] BEAPT.
[1:30:31] BUT THERE'S MORE TO THE MESSAGE.
[1:30:34] THERE'S A RAPTURE.
[1:30:36] THERE'S A
[1:30:38] THERE'S A BODY CHURCH. THERE'S A THIRD.
[1:30:41] THERE'S A FUTURE HOME.
[1:30:44] There's a token.
[1:30:47] THERE'S TOO MUCH IN THE
[1:30:51] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:30:55] I GO WEST.
[1:30:57] I GO
[1:31:00] TO CONNECT WITH THE ANGEL.
[1:31:03] AND THE BIBLE SAYS, "AS THE LIGHTNING
[1:31:07] SHINETH
[1:31:09] FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST, SO IS THE
[1:31:14] COMING OF THE LORD."
[1:31:18] FOR IS THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.
[1:31:21] IT SAYS AND THERE
[1:31:24] WHERE THE CARCASS IS
[1:31:27] WHERE THE THE GATHERING OF THE EAGLES
[1:31:33] WHERE
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; IN THE EAST WEST THE GATHERING OF THE
[1:31:37] EAGLES.
[1:31:39] IT'S HAPPENING IN THE WEST.
[1:31:41] WHEN YOU HEAR WEST IS THE PLACE OF THE
[1:31:44] SETTING OF THE SUN.
[1:31:51] And brother Brham when he was young he
[1:31:54] would meet these people fortune tellers
[1:32:00] say about him
[1:32:02] you moment they see you
[1:32:06] you brother says I was never I would try
[1:32:10] to
[1:32:12] every time they
[1:32:15] SAYS YOU BORN UNDER HIS
[1:32:19] YOU WERE BORN IN THE CROSSING OF THE
[1:32:22] STARS.
[1:32:26] WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
[1:32:28] THERE WAS A WRITING IN THE ZODIAC
[1:32:32] that announced your birth.
[1:32:35] YOU WERE BORN THE SAME TIME
[1:32:38] THAT Jesus Christ WAS BORN.
[1:32:41] YOU HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL.
[1:32:44] NOT FOR INDIANA
[1:32:47] BUT FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD.
[1:32:49] BUT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE SUCCESS
[1:32:52] UNLESS YOU ARE IN THE WEST.
[1:32:55] NOW BROTHER,
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; America is in the west.
[1:33:00] But it was not west enough for the west
[1:33:08] because in THE WEST THAT THE SUN sets
[1:33:14] and being IN THE WEST WHERE THE SUN SETS
[1:33:16] was not enough.
[1:33:21] yet to FIND A PLACE THAT IS CALLED
[1:33:22] SUNSET IN
[1:33:33] the chickens. We have LOST THE CHICKENS.
[1:33:35] NOW WE ARE PREACHING TO YOU
[1:33:43] ON SUNSET
[1:33:45] to be WORTH
[1:33:58] IT NO LONGER THE MINISTRY OF MEN.
[1:34:03] IT CHANGED FROM THE MINISTRY OF MEN.
[1:34:07] IT BECAME THE MINISTRY OF ANGELS.
[1:34:11] SEVEN ANGELS
[1:34:14] FROM ABOVE
[1:34:16] CAME DOWN.
[1:34:18] BIG BROTHER
[1:34:20] INTO A CONSTELLATION
[1:34:23] THEMSELVES.
[1:34:26] NOW, NOW BROTHER IS INSIDE.
[1:34:31] 56 MILES HIGH.
[1:34:37] An aeroplane can't even move in.
[1:34:43] Here is a man
[1:34:46] WITHOUT ANY REGALIA to protect him from
[1:34:48] the weather up there.
[1:34:52] In other words, brother Brham had to
[1:34:54] experience a body CHANGE
[1:34:59] for him to be in the consolation.
[1:35:03] BUT HE WAS THEN GIVEN A MYSTERY.
[1:35:07] HE SAYS, "THEY TOOK ME INTO A
[1:35:09] CONSOLATION OF THEMSELVES,
[1:35:13] AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THINGS THAT ARE
[1:35:15] ONLY KNOWN TO THEMSELVES."
[1:35:20] THE THINGS AROUND THE PYRAMID
[1:35:23] ARE KNOWN TO EVERYBODY.
[1:35:26] THE THINGS AT SUNSET MOUNTAIN
[1:35:29] IS A MYSTERY THAT WAS HIDDEN THROUGHOUT
[1:35:31] THE AGES.
[1:35:35] AND WHILE HE WAS IN THERE,
[1:35:37] HE SAW SOMETHING.
[1:35:39] THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE PYRAMID.
[1:35:43] THERE WAS EVERY SEVEN ANGELS.
[1:35:47] HE SAYS SIX OF THEM WERE ORDINARY.
[1:35:51] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. BUT THE SEVENTH
[1:35:53] ONE WHO WAS A SPECIAL ONE,
[1:35:57] IT DOESN'T MENTION
[1:35:59] ABOUT THE SIX ANGELS HAVING WINGS.
[1:36:04] AND HE SAYS THE SEVENTH ONE AND SWEPT
[1:36:07] BACK THE WINGS.
[1:36:12] WHY THEY ARE BRINGING
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; THE POWER TO FLY AWAY
[1:36:20] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THE REVELATION
[1:36:23] OF THE SEALS IS THE WINGS. THERE'S A
[1:36:25] BROTHER WAS SAYING ABOUT
[1:36:29] I DON'T HAVE WINGS BUT
[1:36:32] I LIKED IT BECAUSE THE WINGS THAT YOU
[1:36:34] HAVE
[1:36:36] PHYSICAL WINGS THERE ARE WINGS CAME WITH
[1:36:40] THE SEVEN ANGELS
[1:36:43] ARE THOSE WINGS
[1:36:45] THE BIBLE SAYS THERE'S A WOMAN THAT WAS
[1:36:47] TRAVAILING THAT'S REVELATION
[1:36:51] THERE WAS A WOMAN THAT WAS TRAVAILING
[1:36:54] WAS GIVEN
[1:36:55] TWO SETS OF WINGS
[1:37:00] SO SHE COULD FLY AWAY TO THE WILDERNESS
[1:37:05] FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS.
[1:37:08] WHAT IS THAT? RAPTURING FAITH
[1:37:12] TO MAKE YOU ESCAPE
[1:37:14] THE THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF THE
[1:37:15] TRIBULATION
[1:37:18] AWAY
[1:37:20] BE IN THE LORD'S SUPPER.
[1:37:23] WHAT I AM PREACHING
[1:37:25] IS RAPTURING FAITH
[1:37:28] BECAUSE THIS DIVINELY REVEALED MYSTERY
[1:37:30] TRUTH
[1:37:33] LITERALLY TURN THE HEARTS OF THE
[1:37:35] CHILDREN
[1:37:37] TO PENTECOST
[1:37:40] TO OUR FATHER
[1:37:42] TO WHO YOU ARE
[1:37:46] BROTHER
[1:37:48] WAS IN THERE. HE SAYS, "I SAW THE FIRST
[1:37:51] ONE, BUT THE SEVENTH ONE
[1:37:54] WAS MORE NOTABLE
[1:37:57] UNTO ME.
[1:38:00] And if I COME TO UGANDA
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; AND I'M IN THIS CHURCH AND I SEE ALL OF
[1:38:05] YOU, WELL, YOU ARE SPECIAL.
[1:38:09] I APPRECIATE YOU. THERE'S NO PROBLEM.
[1:38:12] BUT IF I SEE SOMEBODY WITH A blue suit
[1:38:16] which has stripes, A BLUE SHIRT, A TIE
[1:38:20] THAT IS RED, A SHIRT WITH CUFFLINGS,
[1:38:24] SIDE
[1:38:27] WITH TEETH LIKE THIS, EYES LIKE THIS,
[1:38:32] NOSE LIKE THIS. EVEN IF I WAS WALKING, I
[1:38:36] WILL STOP A LITTLE BIT. I WILL SAY WHO
[1:38:38] IS THIS ONE? BECAUSE THIS ONE IS ME.
[1:38:44] I SEE.
[1:38:48] I SEE MYSELF.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THERE WAS A PROCLAMATION.
[1:38:53] WHERE AM I NOW? REVELATION CHAPTER 5.
[1:38:57] WHO IS WORTHY TO TAKE THE BOOK TO LOSE
[1:39:00] THE SEA OF? OH, THERE WAS NO ONE FOUND
[1:39:04] WORTHY
[1:39:06] IN HEAVEN. NOT ON EARTH, NOT UNDERNEATH
[1:39:09] THE HEAD. JOHN HAD THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:39:15] JOHN WAS THERE ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST.
[1:39:19] REVELATION 5
[1:39:21] AND JOHN WEPT.
[1:39:24] IT MEANS THE HOLY GHOST
[1:39:27] PENTECOST
[1:39:29] WAS NOT ENOUGH.
[1:39:32] YES.
[1:39:36] IF THE SEALS ARE NOT REVEALED,
[1:39:38] EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, WHAT
[1:39:41] HAVE YOU DONE, THAT'S WHY JOHN WEPT?
[1:39:44] BECAUSE THE BOOK HAD A MYSTERY,
[1:39:48] A MYSTERY OF WHO JOHN WAS.
[1:39:51] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. WE ARE TALKING
[1:39:53] ABOUT THE MIRROR IN THE PYRAMID. WE ARE
[1:39:55] STILL LOOKING. WE EXPECTING TO SEE
[1:39:58] SOMETHING.
[1:40:00] BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, ONE OF THE ELDERS
[1:40:03] SAYING,
[1:40:05] JOHN, WEEP NOT. I WANT TO ASK YOU A
[1:40:08] QUESTION.
[1:40:10] THERE ARE 24 ELDERS.
[1:40:12] 12 OF THEM ARE PATRIARCHS OF THE OLD
[1:40:14] TESTAMENT
[1:40:16] AND 12 OF THEM ARE THE APOSTLES OF THE
[1:40:20] NEW TESTAMENT.
[1:40:22] SO OF THE 24 ELDERS,
[1:40:24] ONE OF THEM WAS JOHN. SO WHICH ONE OF
[1:40:30] THE 24 ELDERS
[1:40:32] SAID UNTO JOHN,
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; WEEP NOT JOHN, THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF
[1:40:37] JUDAH.
[1:40:39] WHO SPOKE TO JOHN?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Who spoke to JOHN
[1:40:51] to John?
[1:40:57] JOHN WENT TO HEAVEN.
[1:41:00] JOHN SAW
[1:41:07] WHEN THE BOOK WAS REVEALED.
[1:41:10] JOHN DID NOT SEE IT IN ACTION. JOHN
[1:41:12] DIDN'T SEE YOU. JOHN SAW HIMSELF
[1:41:16] AND HE CHANGED
[1:41:18] FROM WEEPING TO REJOICING.
[1:41:22] AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:41:25] TRUE WORSHIP
[1:41:28] DESPITE THE REVELATION
[1:41:30] WE CAN ONLY SHOUT. AMEN. WE CAN ONLY
[1:41:34] SHOUT
[1:41:35] WHEN THE SEALS ARE REVEALED.
[1:41:39] AND WHEN THE SEALS ARE REVEALED,
[1:41:42] WE SEE OURSELVES.
[1:41:46] THERE WAS A BOY WHO FINISHED HIS
[1:41:50] FATHER'S LIVING
[1:41:52] IN RIOTERS LIVING
[1:41:56] AND HE WENT TO A FAR AWAY COUNTRY
[1:42:02] JOINED HIMSELF WITH A CITIZEN OF THE
[1:42:04] WORLD STARTED EATING WITH THE PIG.
[1:42:08] BUT ONE DAY THE BIBLE SAYS HE CAME TO
[1:42:13] HIMSELF.
[1:42:15] I HAVE A QUESTION.
[1:42:17] WHO CAME TO HIM?
[1:42:19] WHO CAME TO
[1:42:26] HALLELUJAH TO TELL YOU?
[1:42:37] HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:43] That's right.
[1:43:08] HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:27] HE CAME TO HIMSELF.
[1:43:30] IT'S NOT YOUR BROTHER.
[1:43:32] IT'S NOT YOUR SISTER WHO'S GOING TO COME
[1:43:35] TO YOU
[1:43:37] OF THE HOUR. THE INTRODUCTION
[1:43:42] OF YOURSELF TO YOURSELF.
[1:43:45] PAUL SAYS WE LOOK, HE SAYS, "WHEN I WAS
[1:43:48] A CHILD,
[1:43:51] AS A CHILD, BUT NOW THAT I'M
[1:43:55] SPEAK,
[1:44:03] I'M NO LONGER A CHILD." THE BIBLE
[1:44:07] A A CHILD A SON AS LONG AS HE'S A CHILD
[1:44:12] DIFFERENT NOTHING FROM A SER
[1:44:17] IS UNDER TWO
[1:44:19] UNTIL A TIME THERE IS A TIME
[1:44:23] THAT TIME APPOINTED AND WHEN THE TIME
[1:44:26] COMES HE'S GIVEN AUTHORITY
[1:44:30] AND PAUL SAYS
[1:44:32] NOW WE IN PART
[1:44:36] IN PART
[1:44:40] WHEN THAT WHICH IS PERFECT
[1:44:44] IS NOT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR WHEN THE
[1:44:48] MESSAGE
[1:44:50] IS COME WHICH IS IN PART.
[1:44:58] Look in a CLASS
[1:45:02] BUT DAY WE SHALL SEE FACE TO FACE. WHAT
[1:45:08] ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
[1:45:11] YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOURSELF.
[1:45:14] THE BIBLE SAYS ONCE THE LORD HAS SPOKEN
[1:45:18] BUT TWICE.
[1:45:20] HE SAYS ONCE THE LORD HAS SPOKEN BUT
[1:45:22] TWICE HAVE HEARD HIM.
[1:45:26] HOW DO YOU HEAR TWICE
[1:45:29] SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN SPOKEN ONCE?
[1:45:32] IT MEANS YOU HEAR FIRST
[1:45:36] IN YOUR THEOPHONY
[1:45:38] AND THEN YOU HEAR IN YOUR FLESH. THAT'S
[1:45:41] WHY BROTHERS
[1:45:44] WERE OPEN.
[1:45:45] WE HEARD FROM OUR
[1:45:51] AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE ARE HEARING
[1:45:55] FROM OUROPHONY.
[1:46:00] It's my theophony.
[1:46:03] IT'S MYOP
[1:46:06] THE
[1:46:08] BOY.
[1:46:09] THE BOY CAME TO HIMSELF.
[1:46:12] AND WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF,
[1:46:14] HE SAYS, I WILL ARISE AND GO BACK TO THE
[1:46:17] FATHER. THE FATHER WAS WAITING FOR HIM.
[1:46:22] THE FATHER BEFORE THE BOY LEFT,
[1:46:26] HE HAD TAKEN A picture of THE BOY.
[1:46:29] EVERY NOW AND THEN THE FATHER WOULD LOOK
[1:46:32] AT THE PICTURE
[1:46:34] AND SAY, "MY BOY IS COMING.
[1:46:36] MY BOY IS COMING. MY BOY IS COMING." AND
[1:46:40] WHEN THE BOY ARRIVED, THE FATHER LOOKED
[1:46:43] AT THE OLD PICTURE. HE SAYS, "YOU ARE NO
[1:46:46] LONGER LOOKING LIKE YOUR OLD PICTURE.
[1:46:51] SHAVE HIS BEARD
[1:46:53] BODY. GIVE HIM A NEW ROBE. GIVE HIM A
[1:46:57] RING. HE MUST LOOK LIKE HIS PICTURE.
[1:47:05] GOD TOOK A PICTURE OF YOU
[1:47:09] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH
[1:47:12] AND HE PRESERVED IT IN GLORY.
[1:47:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND AS YOU ARE COMING, MAYBE
[1:47:19] YOU ARE SICK.
[1:47:21] LOOSEN THE PICTURE. HE SAYS, "THIS IS
[1:47:24] NOT YOUR PICTURE.
[1:47:26] MAYBE YOU ARE POOR. THAT IS NOT YOUR
[1:47:29] PICTURE. MAYBE YOU'RE INNIA.
[1:47:32] THIS IS NOT YOUR PICTURE. I'M HERE TO
[1:47:35] ASK YOU A QUESTION.
[1:47:36] IF I TAKE A PICTURE WITH MY PHONE
[1:47:40] RIGHT NOW AND I GIVE YOU MY PHONE AND I
[1:47:43] ASK YOU, WHO IS THE FIRST PERSON THAT
[1:47:46] YOU'RE going to look at?
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NOT LOOK AT OTHERS, YOU LOOK AT
[1:47:53] YOURSELF. AND IF YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED
[1:47:56] INH
[1:48:06] SO IF MY PICTURE
[1:48:09] I AM SICK DELETE THAT PICTURE IN MY
[1:48:13] PICTURE I DON'T HAVE MONEY
[1:48:16] THAT IN MY PICTURE I DON'T HAVE THE HOLY
[1:48:20] GHOST
[1:48:22] I
[1:48:26] WANTS MY PICTURE. MY ORIGINAL PICTURE,
[1:48:31] MY ORIGINAL PICTURE.
[1:48:34] I AM THE PICTURE OF WHO I AM.
[1:48:38] THERE WAS A BOY
[1:48:40] WHO WAS IN THE RURAL AREA.
[1:48:42] THERE WAS A BOY IN THE RURAL AREA
[1:48:45] AND HIS FATHER HAD A LITTLE MIRROR THAT
[1:48:49] HE WOULD USE TO SHAVE.
[1:48:51] THE WORDS IS A PICTURE THAT YOU CAN ONLY
[1:48:54] SEE THE MOUTH
[1:48:56] AND THE MOUTH PART IS A PENTECOST.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; THE MOUTH IS PENTECOST
[1:49:02] WHICH IS aerodynamics
[1:49:06] speaking in times AND INTERPRETATION.
[1:49:08] IT WAS JUST A LITTLE PENTECOSTAL
[1:49:11] AND BROTHER SAYS YOU HAD TO CLIMB ON A
[1:49:14] LITTLE CHAIR
[1:49:16] FOR YOU FOR HIM to see his mouth.
[1:49:20] In other words, he need a little
[1:49:21] seminary EDUCATION
[1:49:24] JUST TO SEE HIS MOUTH. BUT ONE DAY HE
[1:49:28] WAS INVITED TO THE CITY. NOW THE RURAL
[1:49:31] AREA IS A SLOW DIMENSION.
[1:49:35] BUT THE CITY IS A FASTER DIMENSION. HE
[1:49:39] WAS MOVED FROM A SLOW DIMENSION TO A
[1:49:41] FASTER DIMENSION AND HE VISITED HIS
[1:49:44] AUNTIE
[1:49:46] BOY IN HIS AUNTIE
[1:49:48] AND THERE WERE SEVEN STEPS
[1:49:51] JUST LIKE IT WAS IN THE PYRAMID
[1:49:54] AND THE BOY WAS PLAYING HE WENT THE
[1:49:57] FIRST STEP
[1:50:01] AND WHEN HE GOT TO THE SEVENTH STEP
[1:50:03] THERE WAS A MIRROR
[1:50:06] A FULLS SIZE MIRROR
[1:50:09] SOMEBODY
[1:50:11] SOMEBODY
[1:50:13] APPEARED
[1:50:14] ON THE OTHER SIDE
[1:50:17] AND HE WAS SHOCKED.
[1:50:19] I DIDN'T KNOW. MY AUNTIE HAS ANOTHER
[1:50:22] CHILD
[1:50:24] AND HE
[1:50:27] WAVED AT THE BOY.
[1:50:29] THE BOY WE BACK
[1:50:33] AT THE BOY

[1:50:51] NOBODY TOLD HIM HE SAID MAMA MAMA MAMA

[1:51:14] LOOKING FOR A WHITE GRANITE ROCK. AND

[2:03:21] that you are taking milk from my cow.

[2:03:44] to tie fire on your tails
[2:03:50] so that you can go and burn the seat.
[2:04:48] so much.

[2:04:56] we thank you for your goodness.
[2:04:59] Thank you for
[2:05:01] making us your children.
[2:05:04] What a great privilege
[2:05:07] that we are called children of God.
[2:05:11] The world does not know us
[2:05:14] as he did not know you.
[2:05:17] But Lord God, there is no greater
[2:05:19] privilege
[2:05:22] than to be children of God.
[2:05:26] We thank you for that Lord.
[2:05:28] Thank you for this convention.
[2:05:31] Since yesterday you have spoken
[2:05:34] You are equipping us
