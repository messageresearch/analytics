TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends uh you're welcome once again to uh to this interview uh this is our second interview and uh uh brother Isaac was asking me what are we going to call this I said well just call it the bench because we seated at the bench uh so uh in this interview we are going to be interviewing and having a conversation with brother Prince Gareth from uh Zimbabwe I met brother Prince uh a few months ago it all started about two years ago when I was in invited by Pastor Joseph and Tha of evening late by tabot to minister here in our national convention uh in SATA and it happened that so happened that I I was preaching two Services there and then uh there was another Pastor a guest preacher Minister from uh from Zimbabwe uh brother side Pastor side and so Pastor side would preach after me or I would I was preaching after him whichever but we're just preaching uh after each other and we enjoyed one another's Ministry and so he did invite me to Zimbabwe and we had a wonderful time there and the Saints uh in guu and so when I went to preach their Easter Easter meetings in guu I by God's grace came in contact uh with this uh brother I think about two people had interpreted for me and then this young man also came to interpret and and after the ministry I was I felt a a big connection with him I I spoke a few words to him there uh but then that connection would lead to his invitation to come in Uganda I believe there is more I did not know a lot or any actually about his testimony and about his life story uh but I kind of felt that he had a calling to to to the ministry and I actually spoke of the same to him directly and little did I know that he was trying in the past to run away and so uh he has since come and been with us here in Cala for about now a month or so he uh came to the youth meetings that we had recently and also has been uh with us here in the local fellowship and you know we've had fellowship with him and and and trying to do as much as we can uh in the work of the ministry uh before I have him greet us I'd like to read Revelation 12 Revelation 12: 11 which says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death and so it is by the word of Our Testimony that we overcome and so brother Prince you're welcome you're welcome uh to to Uganda many are are seeing you for the first time and we'll actually see you for the first time and uh I know you've been with us here at dvf and in the youth meetings and uh you've sung for us you preached to us my you I'm I'm I'm having a difficulty in finding out whether you are a preacher or whether you are a singer uh but brother Prince why don't you uh greet the people just so that they can hear your voice shalom shalom and God bless you it's a pleasure to be here in Uganda the pearl of Africa It Is by God's grace that we are here I'm so glad to be here with uh my fellow pastor Pastor tala it's a pleasure sir so uh I I I talked about singing and I know in this conver in this conversation we are going to talk a lot about singing so so before we continue people need will need to know and I'm doing this uh because of a reason so if you want to maybe I don't know we don't have musicians here with us today but if you want to do an capella for us for just a minute or so I would just allow you to do that for now that's all right thank you so much Pastor tala so growing up uh my mom used to my mom was the singer in the family and my dad as well but my mom is the one that really sang okay so she would sing a song uh that says remind me dear Lord I love that song because it's speaks a lot is in the things that were happening in my life you get to a point of realization and you realize that I am human but you know the lyrics of the song themselves will Minister something to a person so it says those things that I love I hold dear to my heart they have just borrowed they're not mine at all oh Jesus only let me use them to brighten my life so remind me remind me dear Lord so back the curtain of memories now and then Lord show me where you've brought me from and where I could have been dear Lord remember I'm human Lord as humans we forget so remind me remind me dear Lord thank you so much praise the Lord hallelujah my uh you know I uh I thought I know how to sing but whenever I hear you sing I get challenged I'm like oh God do I know how to sing you know you you've been gifted by God and um we will talk a little more H in in the coming few moments on music and this gift that God gave you and where which places it has landed you to and and we'll get into those things later but for now I'd like us to know and the listeners I'm sure they would want to know uh how did it all start where were you born were you born in the message were you born out of the message and yeah let's start there okay um it all started uh many many years ago once upon a time uh I was born in Zimbabwe guu to be precise I am born and raised in Zimbabwe so I was born in the message my my mom and my dad they met I think in 19 uh 80 something there they got married in 1990 and I was born a few a few years later in the message you know I'm part of those children they used to sleep under the bench so when you called it the bench it was quite inspirational because that's where exactly it all started under the bench under the bench exactly I was born in the message I was raised in the message and I grew up in the message you know the teachings of the message uh my mom and dad would read to me the supernatural books is uh you know the Bedtime Stories and all those things so I grew up with all the knowledge and all you know the fundamentals of what the message of the hour is but uh you get to realize that it's a different dimension Al together being born in the message and the message being born in you you see it's a whole different story all together you know most of us when we grow up you know you are growing up you are basing on the experience of your parents so me going to to church was because my I had no option you you you you see I had no option but in the few moments that I would get you know where I used to stay there was a Seventh Day Adventist Church I would go there sometimes you know when I'm not at church uh at my home church I would go there and fellowship with them uh Apostolic Faith Mission I would go there you see so I was curious with this whole religious with this whole religion thing it was for me it was um I wanted to know a lot I wanted to get in you know so many circles in these Ministries see things so the message was not born in me for me it was just going to church because I was born there you know if you'd ask me I would tell you because that's where my mom and dad go but I had no experience about you know what the message of the Hour really was uh were you like the only one born of your parents or uh you were like you have other siblings okay I come from a very big family family uh we are six children and I am third oh you're number three I am third and you know what three means Perfection indeed and and and uh you see that uh God was you know people need to understand there something that you said you were born in the message yes sir but the message was not born in you and we have a lot of people especially the Young Generation and of course uh we this these kind of interviews were really making them to benefit the Young Generation because there's quite a lot going on and we need to to to to to help ourselves to understand what it is that we believe what we stand for the principles of our faith and so many young people think that because their parents are believers of the message that they are also Believers and and and because I've actually when I asked there's a young man I asked one time I said uh when did you believe the message he said oh from since when I was in my mother's womb so you know kind of thought that if their mother was a Believer before they were born so they were also a Believer before they were born actually because you know they were their mother was a Believer so they Believer by proxy but we know by the BAM says that God does not have grandchildren that's right he has sons and daughters and so that phrase that you said you were born in the message but the message was not born in you and so um you would come in church and you would say there's something what phrase was that under the bench how did you say that oh yes uh I would sleep under the bench aha during service during service yes and so now you come into teenage so when does this message really begin to mean something to you okay um were you baptized did you make up your mind at at all at some point in life okay yes I was baptized I was baptized I think it was I was 13 years old then when I got baptized into the message into the body of Christ as we like to say by one Spirit we baptized into one body so I was baptized by Water full immersion into the water when I was 13 years old after I had confessed you know the whole process is you know how we we really do it as according to the the directive of the word of God you know you confess your sins then you get baptized so I think I was 13 years old but even then you know it was more of um what can I say more of culture you see when you um you see other people doing something you you you see it's something that has been done for so long until we be we begin to do it as as religion not because it's an experience or you've actually a very you know that deep conviction in your heart it's you doing it because it's you know it's culture it's our culture in the message that you know you've got to confess it's our culture in the message that you've got to you've got to be baptized yes then you get B you get baptized and you try to live the uh a Christian life and you know the word that I said try I'll explain later what I'm exactly trying to say when I say you try to live a Christian Life you try not to steal you try not to lie and all those things so the message of the hour for me uh the journey is I can say personally the journey started for me when I was 13 years old you know when I made a decision personally you know I made a decision you know what I want to get baptized you know so yeah that's when it started when I was 13 years old MH so and so you you were baptized we would like to hear the ending of that story so you were then baptized and you now continued in church um where were you really sold out to the Lord Jesus during that time 13 years old in the beginning yes I was very you know I was part of those people they would call Pastor at school uh during break time when others are eating at the primary school elementary school where I went we had this place where where there were benches as well so I would these benches were um had four sides you know one facing the North East the South and the West so in the middle of the it was an empty space there had a tree inside so during break time when people would go for break me I would go to that bench and go inside the bench inside the tree I would kneel there I would pray you know I was very serious I was very zealous about you know about God the head Master would actually call me to pray during assembly at school you know uh this young man comes from a very reputable Church you know they have a very good Doctrine eyes he's a young man it's a choice young man he can he come and give offer a word of prayer during assembly I would do that so I was very serious I was very zealous you know uh back then in in those years early years of the you know of making a decision mhm and so uh you you're 13 years old you're serious at school you're being um you know actually I I used that word on you L I know that someone else had used it on you a choice young man you know they kind of noticed that you are this young man that was zealous and loved the Lord now uh but remember you're born in the message and you've done um you've been baptized religiously and but in your heart you have this desire in you to to love God and to serve him right yes sir and so do you ever then continue on to to serve God after that so after that yes I did continue but then you know primary school elementary school and high school they are two different dimensions Al together M you know you know as you continue to grow the the lock that your parents have on you it gets loose a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more you see when you are now in high school you spend less time with them you are far from them so you get exposed to certain things you get exposed to certain crowds that you were not exposed to before and there the there's these people from different places different areas who have uh who have grown up from you know different uh you know teachings yeah you see you get to meet such people some of them they do not even have a conscience at all some of them they are notorious to begin with some of them you know all those things you get to meet certain people there's actually something that I want to interject here you know the scripture says that um we should raise our children in the way we want them to go we should train them up and that when they grow they will not live that way uh let me ask you a question cuz I've heard of people who say well if somebody is raised in the message they actually raised in a bubble why because they are not exposed to the world and to the way things are done in the world and so when they get there the the devil and the world is waiting on them and they'll just grab them but the question I have for you brother Prince is uh the things that your parents used to teach you and when now you went into this Society let's say into the world now you are exposed you're still in church but you're exposed to the world did it a ring a bell at all were you as much as you being pulled towards the world but did the things that your parents taught to you ring a bell at any time okay I would like to you know answer it in this way you grow up from one year up to 13 years there's something that is your parents instill in you you know repetitively every single day you are told my son you see do not do this do not be like this one do not do this do not do this it's something that has been instilled in you for 13 years and that thing cannot just disappear within a year it does not just go you know you choose what you will actually do is you will choose to ignore but the conscience will be there will be there right before you make a decision that voice will come back to you and say but young man is this the way that you were brought up you know better but it's you who actually choose to silence that still Small Voice that speaks to you yeah so you see so in other words the the the things that your parents teach you from 1 to 13 mold you or mold a certain character or a certain conscience in you whereby even when the world pulls you a certain way you just choose to ignore that conscious that character that that that uh you know way about you that has been molded in you but it never goes it never goes and so well then you're exposed to the world and you know you you keep coming to church and then now you you're being pulled by two forces the world and the church tell us about that okay so you know this is like a cycle every time you get to 13 these teenage years they are very tricky you know your body starts to go through changes hormones are all over the place and you know your blood is rushing you get so curious you you you get so active you want to see this you want to do this you want to try this you know and you also want to be cool yeah if there is a if there is a generation that is being troubled by wanting to be cool it's these these teenagers you know you you try so hard to be cool you try to be you know the best dressed you try to be the slickest one of them all you try to be that one who you know who has so many girlfriends who has influence who's charismatic you know in school the most popular the most popular exactly you want to be the bad boy so we used to call it you know this one is bad I'm I'm I'm a bad boy yeah you see you you really want to be like that you want to be assimilated into their society now you see but the thing of it now is these people like in the world they have not they did not grow the way that you did they were not raised up the way that you were raised up so with them there are certain things that they do not even think twice when they want to do but for you you have to second guess every decision orice so at the end of the day you realize that you will never prosper in their area uhhuh you might try to be you try so hard to be like this one you try so hard to speak in slang you try so hard to do certain things but you'll never Prosper the way they do because for them it comes naturally but for you you second guess every time and when you second guess you know when you second guess yourself you never do anything confidently and and actually right here I want to tell the young people that are listening whether or not you were raised in the message if you have a seed of God in you because you see there is this thing that brother banam called a seed Jam a jam of life in you if at all you have that seed of God in you and you go in the world you can never prosper in the world because your Prosperity is in the in the promised land in the in the land of the word in in in in the word of God that's where our prosperity is you cannot Pros in the way they do them they will always outdo you you know if you want to be a thief there is always somebody who will be a better Thief than you if you want to be a fornicator or an adulterer or you know if you want to go in these dance parties and stuff there will always be someone who will do it better than you and you will not actually Prosper like they do prosper and even if it comes to making money and cheating and doing this kind of things you can never outdo them because they know what they doing it is in their blood and something else is in your blood if you want to prosper it is in the promised land this is where our land is is the word of God that's very true and so you you you you so did you become one of those bad boys oh yes I did in in fact you know I I believe personally that you know God gifts people in certain ways there are certain people who are just born to be leaders there are certain people who are just born to be influential people yeah you know you've got people like absolom the son to David he was a very influential young man he turned the whole Kingdom he turned even the uh the chief general of his father against his own father you see now he was just influential like that so you realize that in high school I became very influential in the sense that I would uh I was you know the person would bring an idea yeah you know I would Influence People I would incite people to do certain things you know even though I would excuse myself for example uh during summer we used to wear shorts mhm so me one one day I would just wake up and says you know what guys tomorrow we are going to come all of us we're going to be wearing trousers our winter uniform for no reason you see and everyone else tomorrow comes wearing their winter uniform the people that I played with they come wearing their winter uniform on that day me I won't come to school so when they get in trouble now I'm not there but every other day I'm seen with them to the extent that my head Master asked my parents your young man the people that he plays with but we have never caught him why but the crowd that that he hangs around there were people who used to smoke people who used to beat teachers people who used to escape from the hostels to go and party in these clubs and all these things you see now but I was never caught with them because I was the person who would incite people to do things then later on excuse myself you see now and so while all this was going on I understand that you were also still in church I was and so were you not being convicted at all to to be honest with you you know you get convicted when you get to church mhm and the pastor speaks the very same thing that you were doing that week then you feel so you know in your heart but you you continue to silence that voice because it's a conscience that is always there you continue to silence it until it will come a time when you can easily do anything yeah you see because that conscience you've been suppressing it for a very long time until you know God is a gentleman God will never force himself on you until God will say you know but do what you want to do and that's the problem that we have many people silence the voice of God in them and if only we can be able to yield I always use that word yielding to him you know there's a lot he can achieve through us to the people to the world there's a lot that he wants to achieve through us and so um now you are in high school and and the whole time were you in church the whole time of high school school did you ever get a change of heart especially uh after now leaving these years 13 14 15 16 uh tell us some about your life during that time okay so from then uh fast forward I went to do my a level which is uh fifth and sixth year of my high school yeah so for some time yes I was still going to church but now what had happened I was no longer going to The Message Church okay exactly I had now started going to AFM and I was uh part of the youth there I was actually in the committee the youth Committee in AFM there okay wait a moment now you're taking us fast okay let's hit the breaks a little so what prompted you to leave the message church now to go to the AFM or one of these denominations churches uh well I can say and when did that happen yeah okay I can say that they were friends okay I used to you know hang around friends I was into music my friends liked music okay and the AFM church it was like really really close to where I stayed okay and I was a bit more exposed to you know music playing instruments and you know those denominational boys can really kill it as they say they can they know what they're doing they're so committed m and and when it comes to practice they they practice on a Saturday and you think it's a main service exactly they take it as a job yeah they take it actually they actually get they actually do what we call gigs uh whereby they get hired by certain churches to go and play there so for you to stay at the top of your game you've got to practice you've got to be the best you've got to be the best so these guys were people that I looked up to and say you know what when I grew up I want to play like like this one this one plays the way that I like so the more that you try to imitate them and in the message now their music is not the the way that we play our music yeah so you feel like you are you are constricted like this and you want your freedom you want to learn more you want to explore so I started going with them uh little by little until I was part of them yeah and this part of them sort of when uh the preacher would preach what was your response when the preacher would preach I would also you know in the denominations they speak in tongues you know they are jumping up and down walking up and down they're speaking in tongues and you you look and you're like you know what I want to do this you you try to emulate them you try to there was a point when I would actually go on YouTube listen to tongues of these Mighty Men of God you know these Giants that we call that we used to call train yourself on other speaking Tong that we used to exactly that we used to call you know God's generals ah this one is a Heavenly Commander so and so this one is General this one is Major so and so you know you you listen to their Tong when you get in prayer you are very zealous you know you are very sincere but the prophet says you are sincerely wrong exactly you are so I was so sincere in doing you know all these things but at the same time I was living a double life yeah remember there's the school life there's this outside life then there there's this church life yeah so in church you very zealous in the world you're also what very zealous very zealous in the way that they do their things the way that they dress you know at some point I did not have a girlfriend in high school okay so when I would when we would leave High School like we would walk I think about a kilometer or two from school into town then we separate ways then go to board our you know taxes to go home so I would walk alone with my MP3 player there very small ones and some earphones with my bag everyone is with his own girlfriend you know and I'm walking in front of them or behind them then back home there is a term that they call Chim meaning that you one without a girlfriend or one without hope that they ever going to get a girlfriend you you a church guy you are still scared of this whole dating thing yeah so it really got to me to the extent that you know I I promised them I told them the next time that I'm going to get a girlfriend I'm going to get one that's better than all of you and I did I actually dated a colored girl when I was in high school so there's that life and there's this church life you know and back then we used to go to this uh old people's homes you know share the word uh different places and I've always surrounded myself with these uh people that I thought that they were you know better than me spiritually mhm so I would go with them to the mountains and pray but still you see now in the message of the hour I believe personally that's the only place you can have power actually to overcome sin yeah because out there you can play Church yeah but still living another kind of a life because there is no power for you to overcome that sin that's right you see now so this is something that I I had gotten into I had become part of this world cycle with this world circles and you know people that do certain things and I was influenced into doing certain things so so here now you had become an early mage of Swords you had come from uh Bethlehem and here you are in Moab in the land of Moab you got yourself a girlfriend now and you know you can play music and you know you you're dressing like them you're speaking like them and and you know what pastor uh in this world I believe the message of the hour produce is the best product amen if you go out there from the message of the hour if you go into the denominations they are going to make you a pastor yeah if you go out there they are going to make you a leader because exactly have substance you've got substance so when I was there I would preach they realize you have something they do not have you see now they would give me opportunities to preach I was a very young man know still in high school I would how old were you then uh I think I was now 6 16 years old 16 17 18 somewhere there I would preach even in school the school that I went to I was supposed to be made the the head boy of that school until I did something that I you know I was ashamed of and I had to what I had to run away I had to transfer schools and all those things but I would preach even in assemblies and all these things because You' have got substance you know you are of a higher class where you are coming from there's you know you are grounded you know the scriptures you know the Bible and these ones they all know the know theology so when you get in their circles now you know they appreciate they look at you and say this young man you know he's good Revelation this this one this one you know he's a Seer this one he knows you know he's he's deep he's deep General he's a general he's really what he's really deep so you have that you know you have that um that time in my life where I was very serious about this whole thing about you know um preaching about uh testifying in the streets about doing all these things yeah so um fast forward now I was now in you know my lower six and upper six in school I used to learn at this other high school called Mambo there there was a certain brother his name is called shum Muki you know I would preach in scripture Union so on that particular day I was reading like what they do in the denominations they read from the message of the hour and they preach it in their churches but they do not acknowledge way they are getting it from you see now these people they are very slick and very clever so I was reading from the message that the prophet preached at Kadesh ban yeah so that's the message that I went and preached in scripture Union and that certain brother was there in scripture and after I preached he comes to me and says brother I want to ask you where did you get what you were saying because I know it from somewhere I've heard it from somewhere and I was very open to him about it and I told him you know what I actually was even though I was out there in the world I would always acknowledge that you know what God sent a messenger in our day so it's not something that I was ashamed of so I told him you know I was reading this I actually had the spoken word and I gave it to him he like brother which church do you go to I told him I go to AFM and all these things he says h brother I go to the message of the hour you know under Pastor s and all these things so I got so challenged in my heart that this young man you know just comes up to me and just starts talking of you know um the message of the hour and at that moment that's the moment I decided you know what I am done with these denominations I want to go back to where I want to where I came from amen so in other words uh that young man reminds you of who you are exactly he helps you to come to yourself at that moment and uh so it doesn't really matter whether you're preaching or not uh but the life that you live can really help restore somebody am maybe someone is backsliding or someone has you know lost hope but the life that you live will be a sermon to somebody but the BAM said that uh instead of preaching me as someone leave me one you know um and so that young man Leed you as someone and uh it was enough to uh minister to your heart and say well I need to go back home and so you go back to the church yes so that was now in 2015 2015 M so I I went back in you know to church and and all the things I was now very serious you know I would come from school I would go home at home we have this chick chicken pan that we have behind you know I got so challenged I would go in the in the chicken pan it was empty so I would get in there I would pray for 4 hours straight wow you know going and I'm praying I'm so you know hungry you know to get to know more to get to see the move of God in my life you know I'm in these circles I was in these Circles of these you know prophets and all these things now I know oh I'm backing the message and I know that there's something that is why is it in the denominations when they preach demons they fall and manifest but in the message of the hour have not seen that why is it that but yet we claim to have you know that very thing that is yeah the power we claim to so I was so hungry to you know for God to be seen in my life so I would pray I would do all the I would fast and do all the things preach in school testify in the streets but you know the devil is slick and he's clever yeah you see oh this time this was me trying fast forward to 2017 I was in the message of the hour I was an interpreter in church then I went to University yes now this is a different devil Al together is different from the one in in high school different from the one in primary school you know now you are free I wasn't you would go to school even if you would come back home at around 12:00 p.m. 12:00 a.m. in the morning you still tell your parents I know what I was I was in a discussion even if you weren't they don't don't have any way to prove it yeah you are free as a bird you can do literally anything yeah you see now so I started you know uh fully I was doing music now uh how did you choose how did you choose your course uh I have always had a passion for music there's a certain brother at church his name is brother Silas magaga okay he used to play the bass I loved how he play the bass I would sitting that's the only instrument that I could hear so I asked him how he told me I know I'm doing music in school and all this so I grew up with the mentality that I want to go and do music in school so when the opportunity came I had two choices it's either to go and do psychology or to go and do music and I said you know what psychology I can always do it but let me chase after my what my passion so I went into University and started doing music now music is a very tricky Avenue now that's where we are now reaching at uh the place that we have longer waited for because uh part of the reason why I really wanted to have this testimony go out is we have a lot of young people that are getting into this trap the the Trap Of Music Now music is of God and uh we know that Lucifer was a music leader in heaven and so if God had a music leader God must have loved music that's very true and so I know that uh we we we we worship God through music and that music brings the atmosphere the right at osphere David you know danced and we believe in music we believe in dancing we believe in using all musical instruments and we believe in training them as well training to to to to use them as well uh but when I listened to your testimony I I was really impacted and I felt that there are many others that would want to hear and especially there might be some who are struggling in this area and doing things the wrong way so tell us about uh your University and the music thing and you are now back in church you even interpreting you are now becoming a prayer Warrior and and then now you go back to University so it looks like you've gotten back on your feet now uh you're getting older now you know you're leaving childish things behind you and and now you're going into college and and now you choose um I do not know even how you arrived at that choice of choosing to do that course yes you told me that there's a brother who was inspiring you and he said he was in doing the music school did you ever seek your pastor's councel on that whether or not you should do that I did I actually went to the pastor and the Pastor said you know what music is a very good thing you know besides after you do music you can train also our young people now here in the church you can groom them you know so before you go there and do music um you are innocent yeah you do not know what it entails yeah you know you have very innocent so I you know I was so excited the Pastor said you know what you can actually go and do music it's a it's a good program you know so I went and did music so when I go there now um I grew up in the church when you grow up in church you learn instruments you learn to do things so when I go to school I was already a musician I I was already playing the Basse I was already playing the keyboard I was already a singer yeah so I get there in my class I'm I'm up there and others they're following you see now so of you know there there's this policy that they had when you are level one it's very hard for you to get into the band but me I was the first person to be inducted into the band M as a second basist and vocalist right from L right from the GetGo you see now so when you get into the band they don't play church music by the way remember they play worldly music now they really played in on a professional scale give me some of these songs the examples of them some of the songs that you used to play um the songs by John Legend they used to play the songs by the legendary James Brown they used to play songs by uh satm they would play our local music Thomas mumo oliv this traditional music you know the ones that incite mediums you know that kind of music that's the music that they would play so you are getting into such circles remember now music is very tricky because music has got an influence behind yeah music has got a spirit and inspiration that is behind it so when you partake in it there is this spirit that comes over you I would always wonder why is it you know there's this instrument that we call back home that these people who uh you know communicate with the dead play every time they play it their heads are going I used to ask myself why is it every time they are playing this instrument they all of them three qus of them they've got dreadlocks yeah I used to ask myself why but then you would realize it's an atmosphere that when you start playing you get into that atmosphere literally you get besides your body and get into that atmosphere it's like you put on a certain character you put on a certain even the way that you dress changes by the way mhm you you you start to wear these shambas you start to wear these necklaces with the African map you start wearing oh this funny funny Colors oh there funny hats there funny shoes funny trousers you know funny things because you are it's an image it's not only sound it comes as well as an image it's not only an image it comes as well as a spirit and as an as an inspiration so you start to do things that are very weird and very very strange you see I would go into clubs I was now getting into clubs playing in the name of school in the name of school yeah you see in the name of school I'm playing in clubs the band is a session somewhere the a certain politician is coming I go there there I sing a song everyone claps your hands and you know when people clap your hands you start to feel this this certain thing becoming something after that girls and music ah these ones they Inseparable girls would come with without you even asking for their phone number they would give you their phone number you know I like your voice hey you are so sweet I like the way that you dress you know you've got the style you smell so good this and that they give you all these compliments remember this is not something that you are used to and now the the level of these girls now is different from those ones that High School in high school they are wearing uniforms now in University they dress different M they look different so it's something that is you know it's a sight to be old you're like hey this one she's light skinned she came and gave me a number without me even asking Slowly by slowly you're what you're drifting more and more you're going to BU these women they come elderly women and by this time were you still attending church I was now but remember I was now getting hired to play music in different churches so it started as a Wednesday gig okay and Wednesdays we used to have service tell us about these gigs because as I Know It uh there are many musicians message musicians that do these gigs especially here in Africa where there are not many opportunities for jobs and income generating uh opportunities especially for young people who are not yet up there in in life you're not fully educated yet but gifted musicians and so they they do gigs so tell me about this life of gigs all right now the life of gigs is very enticing remember you are doing what you love that's the first thing yeah and you are getting paid for it yeah so it's like killing two birds with one stone yeah H you doing what you love already and you are getting paid to do what you love I don't know which camera you're looking to I want you to to look at that those young people straight to their eyes and and and tell them tell them all right over here all right so my fellow brothers and sisters music is a very it's a rabbit hole it's very enticing especially these gigs you are doing what you love and you are getting paid for it you know and they pay you handsomely especially not when you're playing in churches especially when you play in the world there the people from the world they not sting with money like the people in the church people in the church they will give you $10 for playing the whole service which is 4 hours but in the world therefore for playing for 30 minutes they'll give you $50 so you compare now in the church I'm being paid $10 to play for 4 hours in the world I'm being given $50 to play 30 minutes where would you rather go and play in the world wow in the world exactly getting more money so it started as just playing in church Wednesday we used to have church in my home in my home church we used to have services on on wedes on Wednesday and I had a gig on Wednesday so that means on Wednesday I'm no longer coming to what no long coming to church in my mind we are still serving God but now I'm being paid to serve God I can now buy a very nice trousers I can now buy a time I can now do this I can now do this you know I'm enabling myself so as I thought so it started with abs scoring Wednesday service from Wednesday became Wednesday service and Friday all night from then it would become even on Sunday on Sunday in church there's more money because it's the main service they would pay you more money than on Wednesday or on Friday so now I stopped coming to church entirely I became a visitor in church when my conscience would tell me man you haven't gone to church for a very long time I just go on a Wednesday after school just you know just to get my names so that they say you know what was your sitting position in church then when you would go right now when I would go in church I wasn't doing anything in church I would just go and sit in church Church sit in the back yeah just to quieten my conscience yeah you see I love the way you say down in Zim in the back MH yeah you sit in the back yeah you say in the back we say the back exactly so you see I usually say if a young person you are young you energetic you're strong and you are sitting in the back of the church why there is there's a problem somewhere that's very true sincerely if you see people sitting sitting in the back of the church true when they are seats in the front there's a problem with them to begin with there's something that they're trying to avoiding the fire the place where they can be changed and a place where they can meet God and a place where they can you know Express themselves to God what are you what are you running away from yeah that's you know so I noticed even before you told me you must have been sitting in the back yes I was I was I would sit in the back and you know once in a while I would call the pastor ah Shalom D how are you I'm I'm doing well know that's wonderful how was my mind how was you know my my siblings I know they all right I know that's wonderful you and you know when you talk to the pastor and the pastor responds positively you feel like yeah God God is still with me everything is well you know one thing that I've noticed about my pastor is he's he's not someone who's indifferent yeah he's not a bitter person yeah you know he's very humble Pastor s is very humble you know when he never makes you feel like you are the worst sinner yeah he will make you feel that there is hope yeah yes you are backsliding but there is hope even the way that you talk to you are my son you know ah we miss you and all these things so when he's talking to you like that and you are like you know what after all I'm the pastor is still you know saying calling me son I'm I'm still good yeah you see and you see this is not only your pastor it's the attitude of the father is the attitude of God exactly I don't believe that this message has come to ridicule us or pull us out and judge and condemn us and and show us a very tough God who is just about to to kill and you know do something bad to us or judge us and you know take us out of of uh of his grace and I believe that this is a message of Grace amen and um and even pastors it really comes to also show that we have to to show Grace to these young people because many of them are running away from church because they are heartbroken maybe they don't feel they received in church or maybe because they they feel sinful or maybe because they feel they they rejected you know in the message circles we have this kind of righteous indignation about us you know someone come addressed in a way that is not usual or speaking or or you know that so and so might have backx done something bad immediately you become indifferent and then you know you show them attitude and you know and these things push them even harder and even harder into the world and so it really comes to show that not only the pastors but even the people the L the people themselves we should be more receiving we should be more gracious to the people because these maybe young people are struggling and they need God they need to find a reason to come back home that's right and that reason will always be love because love will always conquer amen that's and that's why the father re received the son the prodal son received him back he didn't say oh no go back he said I I will receive you not not as a servant I'll receive you as my son because your blood my blood is still flowing through your veins and so the pastor Pastor side and I really appreciate him is um like you said a humble man of God I've been in his house hosted there a few um several days actually and I noticed that he and his wife and family they very Gra very kind people and they really love the Lord and this message with all their heart and so he he would you know each time talk to you and he was very gracious to you he was yeah so he was very gracious to me and you know he would talk to you and you would feel like you know what even if I would go back I still have a place to go back to MH you see now that's his attitude yeah that's how he does his things you see now so uh after that I was doing all this gigs and everything so I remember once I almost got killed I almost died mhm so I became very popular in this secular music okay you know I hadn't released my own songs but I would do cover songs I would sing certain people's songs on weddings I would sing certain people's songs in clubs and all these things I was now getting into clubs and once you get into clubs now you start drinking okay it's that's the atmosphere of clubs you start drinking you pick up smoking so I picked up drinking I picked up smoking I picked up women what exactly were you smoking I was smoking marijuana we call it weed we call it weed because bang exactly because you know they say that weed is different from cigarettes cigarettes they can kill you because they' have got so much nicotine but the the herb as they say it's natural it's now you're taking something natural so you are convincing yourself no this is very natural you know there are no side effects to this yeah so I picked up drinking I picked up smoking I picked up women there was a certain time when I what kind of women oh um just women little girls middle aged older women all kinds of women my goodness all kinds of women I remember um there was a point when I would I would have I'm not proud to say this but I am you know what this is my testimony and I know that probably there's someone who's going through the same thing I would date women my age under my age even way older than me MH you see so I would have a girlfriend for every week my God I would have a girlfriend this week next week I'm bored with this one because I was exposed to a lot of them and I could pick any remember I'm a musician you know they like you know this guy and all these things he's got curly hair he's got a nice voice you know his skin color and all these things so I would I had a wide range to choose from outside this one this week this one next week until it got to an extent I remember at one point I played the base at a certain church and I was training their vocals and there I met Another Woman She's an Old Woman married woman by the way she tells me you know what I like your voice I want you to teach my children how to sing that's how it started MH gave me a phone number and all these things we went to this other Camp there I did not bring my blankets she gave me a blanket of her own she calls me weeks later you know what I'm just laying in my bed and I realize you my blanket smells like you this is how the conversation started my blanket smells like you she gets you know she started getting free with me she started even to call me around 2:00 a.m. in the morning I'm bored let's talk and all these things so from calling me with my name she started calling me babe babe this babe that babe this babe that she was a business woman I wanted to get into business so personally so you felt like this was an opportunity way exactly this is an opportunity for me you know and before I know before there was no evil in your mind like you know living immoral with this woman or something like that there was nothing at all because I I was gone and now I was really gone I would drink every Friday I would get drunk church sometimes I wouldn't even go I would do a lot of things Pastor I would do a lot of things so I started dating this woman this other time I remember she says you know what I'm going to to I want to introduce you to a few people in AR business mul there you know what and and everything so I went with her to arari and when we got there she hired a presidential Lord you see she's someone who drove these very fancy cars so it was her and her friend and then me we went there hir had a very booked a very made a reservation at a very fancy fancy uh presidential Lodge in Mount Pleasant there and all these things we went there and you know this other time she tolds she tells me you know what uh I want to go I want you to accompany me to the lodge MH I want to go and take a shower this is a married woman remember M she's telling me accompany me to the lodge to take a shower huh you know where this thing is going already but I don't know God had just a way of you know keeping me away from it they got into an argument about me going with her so apparently the friend now got interested in me of this married woman she got interested in me so now they are fighting this friend is not married telling the married woman you are married and you want this young man for yourself you are married for crying out loud you see let me have him one one one little demon fighting against another for you another for you exactly so personally when I look at it now you remember uh Jehoshaphat when he was you know all these Kings they come to fight them and God Made Them Fight one another yeah so personally I believe that specifically for that night God Made Them Fight one another for my sake because if I had gone my God this is a married woman and it was going to go very bad H and and I just I when you said that I just felt the presence of God and I want to speak to maybe somebody who is listening I'm so convinced in my heart friends that this is not just a testimony by the prince but is reaching out to somebody that needed it at this moment and I just fa to say to you that the your enemies will fight against one one another God will fight for you and that's how he fights for you if only you can if only you are listening to this that's all it takes it just takes a moment you know and um the Lord will make it happen for you if you can just believe and and brother please go ahead with that testimony so they fought and they had these keys to the BMW you know those fancy cars so while it's fighting one through the key and smashed against the wall I don't know what happened to the cords in there when we went to the car tried to start the car the car would not start the car would not go anywhere so in we didn't go anywhere at the end of the day a few days later or a few weeks later I received a call on my phone God from the husband now wait a moment I still can't get this around my head God put up a fight between these two women in order to protect you amen well someone may say well what about all these other women and the smoking and the things well yes all that happened and was actually happening and this was not a thing for you because uh it's not the only thing that you had that you would have had you would have had you would have done but God stopped you from going this farh because he was protecting you from some something you actually did not know what you were getting yourself into that's very true that's very true so what happened after that the husband calls me on my phone the same day no weeks later after all this had happened we went back home nothing happened for the first week the second week the husband calls me apparently I don't know how he got the messages asks me a question what's going on between you and my wife try to explain where you at this moment I was back home in your room no I was at work actually I was at work I was sitting in the office I received a call from a number that I don't know this very funny number is someone who's linked to the government or something you know they've got these numbers that they use the office numbers so it calls me with an office number what's happening between you and my wife and I'm like nothing happens because I know him H I know him when on our way from harar I actually met him I sat down with him I spoke to him but he did not know what was going on so he says what's what's happening I said nothing says how do you know which wife I'm talking about I said I know you he says who are you I tell him like you that young man that I sit down with I treated you like my own son I treated you like my own my own young brother and this is what you were doing all this time having an affair with my wife I'm Coming For You young men do not run away from me do not hide remember this is a man is is AA we call thema those people thata means what illegal gold mind gold Partners or Prospectors of gold or what whatever it is these people that carry know this this knives there's these bullies that will come and they'll cut your head off without even thinking twice you know because they've got some protection that they have I don't know and this is not something that I want to get into but so he calls me I'm coming for you young man you I said you know what I'm sorry nothing happened she's just a friend how old are you I tell him my age do you know how old my wife is my wife is 45 years old what relationship what friendship can you possibly have with my wife you and my what friendship can you have with my wife we have a child the same age as you you see now so he tells me don't run away from me don't hide I'm coming for you you are not sorry you're going to be sorry the wife calls me on my phone hey Prince this is what is happening whenever just say you are sorry because he's very Furious now hey don't tell him that you knew that I was married and all these things now look at the thing that I'm now in between now I tell you if there's a time that I prayed I went home I knelt down beside my bed before all this had happened my mom had told me my son I don't like the way that you're talking with this woman yeah because I I'm a woman I know women this is not going the way that you are thinking that it is going yeah she's getting too comfortable she's a married woman how can she get so comfortable to call you at around this time and what was your response my response was you know M you know in the world they do these things besides I know how to take care of myself so in my mind I'm like I'm dismissing mama you know what you have started my you know this this something that mothers have I think it's a gift that God actually gives them you know I like to believe that mothers are prophets yeah they can tell if something is going on in your life even before you tell them they can tell and ask you ah what's going on so my mother has got that she's got she's got this strong intuition she says certain things and we deny it everyone denies it then it goes exactly the way that she said like you see you remember that day I told you this and this and this and like yeah so I knew that my mom somehow she knows and this is what's going to what is going to happen but in my mind I was dismissing it so after that I went home I knelt down beside the bed I prayed and that's why really uh if you have a mother you need to listen to your mother definitely because God uses mothers God speaks to mothers and if only you can be able to listen to them uh if their counsel is Godly listen to it even if they're not Christians by the way even if they're not Believers still God uses them to help us and yeah and then you went down on your knees and started praying and I prayed and I told God God you know me I never touched that woman remember that day I was supposed to go with her but because of the fight that they had I did not go the end nothing happened so I had a basis to go before God with and I'm like God you know what I never touched that woman and and you are praying a prayer and I'm praying a prayer you actually of course I know you in desperation at this moment but you don't even have an idea I don't that it is God who actually let that happen so that you'll be able to come to him on that same basis on that same basis I did not know so I know done beside the bed God I promise if you get me out of this one I'm done with married woman with married women I'm never the funny thing is God hears and he heard me instantly that man never called me up to this day he never called me again he never sent a message to me again he just went quiet he just went silent you was going to come and shoot me HH he was going to kill me the wife told me says Prince this is a bad situation do not retaliate because he he always Carries a Gun things can go sideways he told me that I can make you disappear young man that's the husband there's nothing that you can do about it I can make you disappear just like that tell me a little more about the prayer you prayed and everything that you promised to God in that desperation mode in that desperation mode I promised God you know what God I'm done with this life if you get me out of this one I'm done I'm uh for me it's this is the end of it I'm coming back but you know God is God knows your heart God knew my heart that I was just saying this to get out of this situation even after I did I continued drinking I continued smoking until one day I remember very vividly I was so I would never used to get drunk I would drink everyone that I would drink with would get drunk but not me but on this particular day I got drunk and I told myself you know what let me just go in the house and just wash my face I entered into the house went and stood before the mirror it was dark I stood before the mirror past I felt convicted I looked at myself it's like I could see inside myself I felt so convicted God what am I doing I'm drifting I'm lost I started crying I had my hands on the sink there te tears falling down my face God I'm never going to get to do this this is the last time that I'm going to drink I promise the next day I got so sick from the alcohol that I drunk last night I got so sick to the extent that I was so sick people they call it hangover but no that was not hangover I got so sick and that was the time that was close to the Easter meetings I think of the Year 2020 or 2021 that time Pastor May Pastor was coming to know him preached for him some time last year he a very important someone in my life that I hold so dear because he plays a very pivotal and important Ro as I'm about to tell you so before that when he came I talked to him I spoke to him I remember these were the days that I was you know used to pray a lot I used to sing and people would get healed just from singing in church I would sing and someone would tell you you know what I was going through this when you sang this is what happened so that particular the the previous Easter meetings they came and they preached and I sang a song I found a friend a good friend in Jesus that's the song that I sang and the Holy Ghost came down then he came to me and he spoke to me afterwards says young man there's something that God has put on your life you know protect this gift very jealously I want to tell you women with this gift they like this be very careful but even though after that I went and did whatever I did when he heard when Pastor because he loved me so much when Pastor s told him that the young man is gone he got so hurt in his heart so when he came now 2021 I think to preach for us at the M Easter meetings I was not there I was at my gig playing at another church in the same vicinity same area the way that I was dressed so the previous night he calls my young brother says I have a burden in my heart I want to pray for your for your older brother but he's not here but I'm going to pray for you he prays for my young brother I'm not here I'm not there I'm home at the same night the same same night that he prays for my young brother that's the same night I wed to the mirror and felt so convicted in my heart God I'm not going to do this anymore on the more I was done with drinking I go to that church I start playing Bas something in me just tells me you know what young man just go to church I did not care how I was dressed the way that was I had this ripped jeans very nice sneakers you know I was you know this this young man you know I was playing at a certain church and you know you're trying to get the girls as you're playing and all these things so I go to church like that I sit in the back and after the service end back again in the back again after the service ends the pastor my says you know what young man I'm so happy to see you he never mentioned anything about you know what you've been doing and all these things no he did not do that he showed me love yeah I'm so happy that you are back you know I that's what we need to do that's what we need to do I've been praying for you in fact yesterday I actually prayed for you and all these things and I tell you the next day after that the next week I told my friends that I was playing with in this churches my friends thank you so much you've been so kind we've played together for so long but you and I this is the way that we part ways I'm going back remember I so full of sins but I told God I you know you on Wednesday you preach the message that there is guilt you know false guilt personally I believe that what God the one that comes from God is actually not guilt I believe that it's conviction yeah that's what it is the devil makes you feel guilty yeah but God does not make you feel guilty God makes you feel convicted that's right so guilt takes you from the presence of God yeah but conviction brings you to God brings you to God so I was convicted I came to God I told God you know I did not have the power to confess then I was just coming to church with my sins every service I would go before the altar I would cry for my life God help me you know the way the things that I've been through the things that I've done I don't deserve to be here I would cry with my life every single day until one day God just spoke in a certain way that he spoke to me I went to the pastor I sat down with him Pastor you know what I've come to to make my life right I'm going to tell you everything even the things that I've confessed before I want to turn over a new live I sat down with the pastor I confessed my sin so bitter in my heart I got so bitter you know when you're out there let me tell you one thing that I know when you are a child of God and you have gotten the knowledge of the truth and you go out there in the world to sin you have no peace yeah at all I had no peace I wouldn't sleep at night when everyone is sleeping even up to today I'm still affected by it I don't sleep people can sleep everyone else can sleep me I'm always awake M now I get awake I read the Bible I I I listen to music and I listen to the tapes now but back then it was me and my thoughts where am I going what is my life going to be like but I had no power to overcome but still I would feel so guilty the way of a transgressor is hard I lost appetite for food I got into anxi anxiety anxiety turned into depression I started to look at you know my these other people that I used to go to church with you know they have gone so far in their life and I'm so I'm still behind I don't have any money all the money that I used to have I I don't have it anymore I used to go in these clubs and I would and I remember even after coming back to church I had this other gig that I had at this other club called Milan it's a family restaurant so it was a competition for vocals I would go there I would sing and I actually the in the competition when others went to youth in Z I did not go to youth because I had a gig that I had to go to on Saturday my my my and I had to go and sing and I went and I sang and I won they gave me money $500 you see other people started giving me contracts this and that but I had to turn those contracts down because now I had given I had made a choice I I want to go back to church and the way that I did it was because I said I want to buy a bass guitar for myself so I'm just going to go to that compet win the money and B buy the bass guitar and I did I bought the Bas I actually brought it to church it was dedicated in church that bass guitar that I got there and I played it in church for some time until I started feeling guilty you know we started having these all nights with these brother other brothers friends of mine you know brother brother Michael Brother Martin schum you've met brother yes we used to go to the mountains brother far Elisha would go to the mountains and pray and we told ourselves that young men we are going to be very honest with one not this is a safe space if you have anything that is bothering you when we come here before we pray let's talk about it talk about so I would tell them you know me I'm having a problem I'm failing to let go of this girl that I'm dating I was dating a very beautiful young woman there very prosperous coming from a very rich family you know she was a musician as well a very prominent musician she was loved by so many even the people in politicians who had money they actually wanted her but she would reject because she Li she liked me so I couldn't let her AG go for me it was like it was a drug but every time I would go up that mountain I would tell them my friends I'm failing to overcome this issue I'm failing to overcome this issue of playing in and singing in clubs and all and they would pray for me we would pray together there was no judgment Brothers I'm I'm I'm troubled but you know the spirit of pornography and masturbation would pray about it and one day I tell you God is the prophet says even when you you sin do not run from the presence of God stay there stay there God one of these days is going to find Mercy for you exactly he's going to meet you at your point of need so he met me at my point of need I came back I confessed my life Slowly by slowly slowly by slowly slowly by slowly all these things passed away all these things went they just died and went so I started you know I had a conviction in my heart you know what I I feel like I want to go and preach in the streets there to let these other people know but I did not want but I I was afraid because in my mind I'm like is this even the will of God for me to do that before you get to the part of praying the part of uh preaching you you mentioned about these things CU you see you've taken quite some time talking about them but uh I am sure someone wants to hear a little more on how you were able to overcome them did they just evaporate did they just go did they go slowly they went immediately what what was the experience like okay for me the experience was it was a process it's not something that I was like I just woke up in the morning and I said you know what I'm done with this the same the way that I did with drinking beer and you know it was different now because this this thing had a different hold on my life you see I was an addict to these things like I'm I'm not I'm not ashamed to say it I was an addict to pornography sides I was an addict to sleeping around I was an addict to sex itself because remember there was a time I would have a girlfriend every other week and with this girlfriend is not just sitting down to talk no it wasn't you see so I became an addict so for me to let go of such things it was very hard but it took just praying praying going to the pastor every day Pastor you know what I fail again today the pastor would pray for me you know what but one thing that I tell you for you to overcome evil spirits have got uh uh a ground where they operate the reason why we fail to live a Victorious Life is you know you be you you're sining because you are living in Sodom you go and confess and after you confess you go back again to Sodom it's the breeding ground for that spirit that Spirit would still come back because you are giving it access you are enabling that Spirit to come to you so what I had to do was to change the people that I hang around with I had to change the influence so there are certain things that you had to intentionally do because of what you wanted to do exactly there are certain things that you have to do as a Christian intentionally because you know that if I continue along this path I'm going to end up here let so so you had to change your friends I had to the people you were hanging around the places you were going to what else did you have to change I had to change uh a lot of I had to change a lot of things Pastor I had to change uh the sites that I would even go to on my phone I had to change a lot of things I had to change the way that I dress I had to because there are certain spirits that come to you because of the way that you dress M you see now everything what about the songs I had to change my music that's one thing that I really had to change I had to delete I had more than I don't know more than 100 or 200 albums by emm by JayZ by you know this Bob males by the Nina Simons but I knew a lot of these musicians but I had to change every music that I had because the spirit feed on those things on those things they feed on those things you see the prophet gives an example and says there was this a pachy person who had two dogs he says I have two dogs in in me they always fighting the white dog and the black dog and the prophet said which dog wins the fight says the one that you feed the most so that's just how it is you know you've got this flesh you are human no matter how saved you are yeah no matter how filled with the Holy Ghost you are you are human as long as you in this flesh you are susceptible to falling into sin exactly you see now but now what gives you the power to overcome is what do you feed on you have got to change your diet because you are what you eat if you Feast on worldly things that flesh will overcome if you Feast on the word of God that spirit that is in you that will what it will overcome that's right so I had to change everything I had to change my music I had to change the places I used to hang around I had to intentionally these things remember you have to do them intentionally you have to come to a decision and say you know what I'm not going to hang around you anymore yeah some of them you actually had to tell them to their face and say you know what my friend I think where I'm going and where you want to go there are two different places I'm now a Christian ah you you seem to like your beer too much me I a Christian we don't have any grounds for communication anymore we've got to part ways I'm not doing this because I resent you I I hate you no I'm praying for you that one one of these days you follow in the same light that I'm what that I'm now walking in but as of our friendship mhm I'm sorry it has got to end here mhm that's how I had to overcome I had to spend more time with those Brothers I would go up the mountain with we we made we devised a way that we would meet even though we have nothing to do would just meet in town would sit would go for Bri would talk with just to you know keep yourself around you know such people and when you do so Pastor when you fall in sin when you just go around to hang with them you feel convicted in your heart after you have sinned to get to go around such you know such people to to just fellowship with them you feel so guilty what do you have to do you have got to go go and confess so it's an atmosphere now that is encouraging you to confess it's an atmosphere that is encouraging you to stay closer to God it's an atmosphere that is encouraging you to stay away from sin because you know that if I get into sin and I've got to meet those Brothers on Friday for all night you are so convicted that you know I cannot go and pray with them these guys have been praying they've been listening to the tapes they've been you know testifying and I'm coming with my sin in you know the of these people I've got to make my life right yeah so in other words you had to change um the places you went to the friends you kept your contact list contact L your contact CH and and you know have a new contacts and people you are now whatsapping and texting back and forth and you also have to change your music you had to change your dressing you had to change looks like you had to do a real change yeah it was a revamp a renovation of a lot of things but remember these things you don't just let them go it's slowly by little by little intentionally taking the right step the right direction exactly intentionally sometimes you let go of you know uh dressing a certain way but maybe two weeks later you find yourself you know what I missed the way that I was used that I used to dress it was free you know you'd go back there but then You' feel you know what I've got to the extent that I remember when you came I used to wear these really really tight jeans you remember then you talk to me about it but you know it's something that I had to grow out of slowly I used to wear ried jeans yeah even my friends at church they knew Prince even always ripped jeans to church yeah these ones with you know I would just put something underneath so that it doesn't show my skin but it was ripped anyhow I remember telling I was like this this young man has something but how well these jeans are too tight I had to tell you brother Prince this jeans are too tight exactly yeah it looks like you're poured into it exactly I don't know what you thought of me when I said that exactly so it's it's one of those things but you the more the love that you have for God the prophet says it's your attitude yeah towards God that's right you see that and the another thing that I want to tell you people it's not you that has got to try mm because as long as you try as long as it's you that is trying you can never overcome that's right you have got to come to a certain point where you say you know what God I've tried so many times you know on Wednesday I I ministered you refer to that in your speech uh on false guilt and I spoke a little bit about God is righteousness there's so much about people thinking that it's all about uh when we talk about Holiness and righteousness It's All About Us trying to be like God trying to be holy it has nothing to do with you or with me it has all to do with him you see it is his righteousness that he has imputed unto us by faith cuz you see the only thing you have to do is to believe you know like you believe that this is not you this is you and you desire to be righteous and you desire to be so then you by faith took steps towards the direction which you desired to go into and then God in the process gave you his righteousness you see I think it's in the message who is God the prophet says that if you say you are a drunkard and you want to drink don't worry you'll start drinking if you say you are a sinner and you want to sin don't worry about it just along the line you'll start sinning because God will make your body fall into subjection to your confession is the high priest of our confession exactly you read a scripture they overcame with the blood of the lon the word of their what their testim of their testimony you've got to want it yeah you've got to want to change yeah you've got to say I will change and you have got to surrender to God and say you know what God it has got to be you doing it in me I'm surrendering mhm when you fall do not beat yourself too much when you fall go back to God and confess God I'm sorry I did not want to do this you know in my heart I don't want to sin against you you pray about it and God I tell you this things will just fall beat by beat fall the more that you build a relationship with God the more that you spend more time in prayer with God certain things just begin to drop off exactly it's an atmosphere it's like a rocket a rocket before it's launched it's as big as this bottle M when it's launched it gets to a certain level it drops something it goes higher it goes to a certain level it drops something it goes higher until it's only the capsule with the astronauts inside that's the same way it is in Christianity the more that you go higher with God the more things begin to drop because that atmosphere does not allow you to get in that atmosphere with certain things they've got to naturally they will drop on their own it's just like uh when I was in primary school there were certain friends that I used to play with when I got to grade seven and I passed my grade seven some of them failed if they just dropped off I did not go to them and say stop playing with me anymore them themselves they just felt you know what this guy is now going to high school we are we have got to go back to to primary school and you know what your conversations they they became different when I passed my old level certain people that did not pass my their all level with me they just dropped off the same way when I went to University the same way it is when you get in in Christ they will just drop off on their own these people they start to see you know what every time they start to want to speak vulgar you're like please when I'm around please don't don't talk like this all of a sudden they start to feel guilt and say this one is holier than thou do you do you know do you actually know that song of set your wings on the Winds of Faith yes I know it ahuh you can s that chorus is exactly what you are saying talking about exactly so uh that's how it is these things will begin begin to fall off but remember it is not you that has got to do it yeah youve just got to want it in your heart yeah and you you said something that it is your faith yeah someone asked me a question yesterday actually after the service I was out there you know a certain sister walked up to me and asked you know brother Prince you've spoke I've heard you speak about your testimony but I want to ask you how do you overcome such things because remember you know what it's hard you know what and I said you know why it's hard it's because you are the one who's trying yeah you are trying that's why it is hard yeah the very moment you stop trying become Christianity must not even be hard it must not it must be it's a life it's not like it's hard for you to Blink yeah it's not because it's part of who you are so if Christianity is part of who you are and it's God who has got to do it these things will just go and they'll just fall away yeah so you said something about you know it being uh faith faith the Bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God if you stay away from the from the word of God you will never have the faith to believe for your salvation and your Victory or to even overcome at all you will never you will live a defeated life you see now if you want to see the prophet actually speaks about and says for you to if you want to see um the devil can only get to you when you go outside of that blood of Christ mhm when you step outside of the blood then the devil has got you mhm you see now so you've got to stay in that City of Refuge and the word of God is that City of Refuge young people we have got to stay glued to the word of God that's right we are wasting so much time on Instagram we are wasting so much time on Facebook we are wasting so much time on so many things a day that is 24 hours you realize that 20 hours or 18 hours you're on your phone 3 hours you sleep you only have 1 hour to read the Bible you have one hour to pray you have 1 hour to do all these things and to do other things as well so you're now just squeezing in God for 5 minutes you know what just for 5 minutes with God just for 5 minutes to read just one chapter or a quotation that has been posted by another sister on their status that's the one that you reading you like I know what I read the quotation today so I can pray but that's not the prophet says now other people will actually take their WhatsApp and uh activate all the other chats and groups and all the church groups and the the the the Believers and whatever whatever to do with with church and you know the word of God and God they will archive it that's very true okay and then you just come back to when you feel you have a moment you're bored and you're free we just give you 10 minutes and just go through it and then you're like okay now that's a day just to silence your conscience yeah just exactly I've been there I know exactly what it is it's to silence your conscience it's not because you love God but your conscience is telling you man you've spent too much time watching movies yeah um come on you start to feel something you you know then you're like I know what let me just quiet this voice and just kneel down besides the bed for 5 minutes and pray yet the prophet says if you spend 3 hours in the world World equal amount of time in prayer you see now you've got to spend that equal amount of time think that you have had 18 hours you are looking at this Instagram post these naked women you're looking at all these things you're looking at this one dressing this certain way this one they speaking a certain language there's a certain music that is playing there and in your mind that song is already playing you are harming it and you're not even aware that you are harming the song that was sung by Beyonce some some time ago you are Hing it but you saw it on what you saw it on Instagram Instagram whatever you asked me in the afternoon there's this song that I was singing that song it stuck with me because I was on Instagram looking at this other friend of mine he's a basist he's the one who taught me bass his name is called Liberty know really so I was he was he played a cover to that song and I listened I I was like you know what this guy knows how to play I switched off my phone and it's been two days now I've been singing that song back to back I've been singing But simply because I saw it on an Instagram real now imagine how many things you seeing on an Instagram real some of the things are not music but they get in your mind they influence you how you think along the line you see now you well some of us at some point I had to delete Facebook I had to delete you know all those Instagram and you know social medias I had to completely delete it off off of my phone because I needed time to focus to focus on the ministry to focus on um on on time with God on family on on on you know studying you know for the ministry and and things so you see if you know what is good for you you intentionally do things to help you achieve the desired end that's and you were going to say the prophet said something and then I interrupted you I don't know whether you remember what you wanted to say uh just now yeah a few a while ago uh I forgotten well then again you were talking about prayer and how prayer really got you to this place uh of of Victory you know it it was yes I I know I all this came because I was asking you to tell us a little more on how you overcame these things and U then of course prayer coupled with prayer it was not only going slowly by slowly and hearing the word but also prayer prayer exactly and you were not praying alone you had a group and a team that you praying together so you see we have to pray one for another the Bible says confess your faults your sins to another and pray one for another and and so that's very important I believe that that was part um has formed part of your victory yeah that's very true and so so then you said you came to now a place where you now can say that is behind me exact drinking is behind me smoking is behind me women is behind me or do you still go back to this stuff no so yesterday when I was having that conversation with that sister she says you know what but sometimes you you feel like you know what I want to do this and I say you know what the reason why you want to do it is because the desire is still in you you are running from sin with your body but your heart still is in it yeah your body is the one that is running but your heart is still there your heart still desires so as long as your heart is still there as long as you still have that desire for sin yeah no matter how much you might try to avoid it you will go back to it yeah you see now you will still go back to it so I I can safely say that God has worked on the desire for me it has been the desire that God took care of of these things I used to like whiskey a lot I used to like it it about it they used to have um this some Believers even say it's not written anywhere that we should not drink so well then talk about this did God take away that desire for whiskey for me totally I used to love whiskey a lot Pastor you know that smelled just hey I feel like you know what I want to you feel you already in the anointing of whiskey and it's it's tastes sweeter you know than than all these other things it's so nice you know it's smooth it's you know it's got this thing to it plus you know when you are it's got the style that it has you know this guy has got style he drinks expensive beer you know what it's expensive so when I was there in the world I would never not at one point lack money to buy whiskey I was never too broke to get drunk I will tell you the honest truth I was never too broke goodness it was after I came into the message that I would fail to even get money to go to church but when I was out there every Friday we are going out every Friday we are going to drink and we we would spend more than $150 on different types of beer my god of whiskies and all those things but after that right now if I pass through by someone who has been drinking that smell on its own I feel like I want to vomit this is me and this is not only you my precious brother it is everybody that has received the doors of the Holy Ghost exactly and I I think this is where we need to tell the young people look you don't the moment you receive a dose a good dose of the Holy Spirit you will not even have to debate whether or not is written anywhere that you you should not drink you should not drink yes because you see the holy spirit will take away the appetite just like a drunk woman rather a pregnant woman if she's pregnant she doesn't have appetite for things she would normally do so we would normally want to drink would normally want to smoke would not normally want to go live immorally but you see when you receive a doors I call it the doors of the Holy Ghost amen when you receive that experience when you meet God first to first when you have that encounter with God when you have that experience that desire dies and it dies permanently it cannot stay right in there it caes can to the extent that you even detest the smell of whiskey exactly exactly so for me it's the smell on its own hey it's really you know I feel the that feeling that you you know what you want to throw up you know these days I'm I'm even allergic to smoke if I pass through by someone who's who smoking I get home my eyes are so itchy my nose is you know you having those G sounds in your ears you are constantly you know that's but I used to smoke mhm remember I used to smoke W but now if I just pass by someone who's smoking I already problems or the song says I've Been Changed exactly I've been reborn amen my whole life has been rearrange what a difference it makes you see when the Lord comes in your life he completely changes you whereby imagine a man who used to smoke but now would become allergic to smoke to smoke tell me about that tell me about that if it is not the Holy Spirit that's right so you see if anybody struggling with these things if you're struggling with pornography if you're struggling with smoking if you're struggling with immorality you don't need to beat yourself of or even try to stop all you need to do is to yield to the Holy Spirit and be filled with the Holy Ghost the day you are filled with the Holy Spirit you will never have that desire again it dies permanently we are hearing brother Prince's testimony but but we've have we have a lot of testimonies of people like this that can tell you I had desire for this desire for that desire but now it's gone and you can't find it anymore it's you know you a new creation you know if we do not have people like you how can we even testify of the saving power and the redeeming power of the blood that's right you see brother Prince apart from communion I've never had whiskey in all my life I've never smoked I've never I remember when I was about 5 years or six years you know I we used to see people smoking you know on the road and so I picked a paper I said let me try smoking so I lit it and I put on my lips I coughed and coughed and coughed that was the last I said I'll never try again so so I do not know really what it feels like to smoke or what it feels like to drink or what it feels like so sometimes we preach these things and and the people be like ah Passa doesn't know what he's talking about because he has not experienced this kind of life he has never been into into the club so what about this man then what will you talk about this man you see I'll tell you it's not about whether I've experienced it or not if I preach it it's by inspiration and it works and here is a living testimony to tell you that no matter how much you've gone how deep in sin you've gone amen There Is Power in the Blood there is power in the in the power of the Holy Spirit the moment you receive the Holy Spirit you are changed and you are changed forever am and so brother you were then talking about when you receive this change and this experience with God then you took to street preaching yes I actually did take to street preaching uh it was after you had come and you you had spoken to me uh my dad always you know he always knew somehow he always spoke to me about it somehow you know I don't remember exactly what I spoke to you but I know that we were in in this campgrounds at at in guu gu yes and then I know you interpreted for me and uh as I was preaching I received the Revelation that this young man has Ministry blah blah blah I don't remember exactly how I phras it do you remember I do what what was the words after after after service I was in the tent you actually sent a brother to call me okay I was in the tent there so brother he came and said brother Prince Pastor TMA wants to talk to you okay so I came to the car where you were standing by the pastor's car and you said um young man you preach that's the word that's exactly what you said young man you preach I said uh no brother was there he can attest to this I said ah no and he said no I'm not asking you I am telling you I remember that yeah you actually said I'm not asking you I am telling you and I'm telling you this under inspiration when you were praying there you know the Holy Spirit came and I felt that I should come and pray with you I actually wanted to come and pray with you but the Holy Spirit told me no don't pray with him let me deal with him when he's there on the altar then after that then you spoke to me and said you know what um uh you are are you are you are you a preacher I said h no I Don't Preach you said I I'm I'm not asking you you even went to the extent of telling the pastor and you said Pastor said if you will not let this young man preach in your Pulpit the first time that he's going to preach on the pulpit will be in my church in Uganda and it happened exactly the way that the way that you said it so after that I I went and I spoke to the pastor and the pastor I remember he actually said you know what I know I think you remember he said I know that this young man has got yeah afterwards we spoke to him he said I I yeah I remember those he actually said that I know already so with Pastor s now he what he does is that he won't come and tell you you are supposed to come and preach in church yes says if God has called you to preach go and preach yes it does not necessarily mean go and preach in the church yes go and preach in the streets yes if God has called you to preach there's one way that you can that you can really know that God has called you to do something try it and if God is in it God will prosper it yes that's right so I was having this debate where I wanted to say I was having this debate in my heart should I should I not should I should I not go and just testify in the streets so I remember one day you know I had the Holy Spirit spoke in my in my heart countless times and I would say you know what I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it then I remember one day I was in a in a texi going into town there was a man who was sitting in front of me he was he was drunk was holding a bottle he was drinking all of a sudden that man started to preach he started to preach the coming of the Lord is now I know you are judging me because I'm holding this drink I do not even want to drink myself you know what he was like so Frank and so open and he looked at me and said am I lying my brother am I lying he was asking me am I lying they said no you're not lying you're telling the truth I felt so convicted the Holy Spirit asked me a question so you are now going to let drunkards preach to You Preach to you instead of you preaching instead of you preaching to them I felt so convicted after that I went and I spoke to the pastor I said you know what pastor this is what I've been feeling yeah and the Pastor said my brother if God has called you to go and preach go and preach so after that we had an all night after praying and everything I was sleeping in my bed everyone slept so me I I hardly fall asleep so I was sleeping I was just laying in the the bed and I was thinking so with this whole preaching thing this whole street preaching thing heyh this is hard now this is hard so at the same time that I'm thinking about it a certain brother a friend of mine called brother job masasa sends me a short video of Pastor Perry green when he was talking of how he the prophet helped him to know the will of God in his life and said if you have a desire for it that's the first thing is it scriptural that's the second thing the third thing is good who Finance it that's how you get to know the will of God so at the same time I'm thinking I'm asking myself how do I know the will of God pertaining to this issue at that very same moment that brother out of the blue remember it's very very early in the morning he just sends me that that uh out of nowhere he just sends that to me I I read it I felt so convicted the next week we started this we called it a comie Ministry in the comes we know we just started as a joke we're sitting after church we would sit in the back of the of the combi there going into town soes taxis taxes exactly we call them comes back home so sitting there with the brothers just say brother you know you are going to make brother F to preach today in the comi we are just going to make him to preach today don't tell him about it so when everyone sits in the com and it's going home in the taxi one brother will just say uh good evening parents I would like to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know what we we just coming from church today and we have a brother with us today is feeling you know the push of God in his life to just share with you a few words brother far is going to preach to you today brother far is not even aware that this is what is going on but everyone is now listening brother far has got nothing to do now he's got to speak something after he speaks he says like brother Prince is going to speak as well you know so it just started something like that and it graduated it graduated graduated until one know of this days I went into the into the streets there I just said God I'm just going to go there I just went and that's just how this whole preaching thing started preaching in the streets and I remember one day was very vividly I was supposed to go with some of the my friends to go to preach together they did not show up and I told God and I'm like today I'm tired and my friends did not come so I'm going home I was in the office I'm going home the holy spirit said there are there your friends that called you to do this mhm that today you will tell me that because your friends did not not come so you are not going to go mhm it's your friends that called you to do this oh you preach because of your friends they said you know what I'm just going to go home and he said go home you want to go home go and let's see if you're going to get there Pastor I I shook in my shoes that voice was so vivid he said you want to go home go home and see if you're going to get there go home I remember the only thing I remember is I was holding a Bible in front how I left the office I don't know I remember I'm just standing there in front of the people at this passport office the passport office is there where there so many people there this now no it's in gu I'm standing there in front of you know and I'm with my Bible and I'm reading it was already too late that was the same one that I was preaching there it was already too late and I'm preaching to them I don't even know how I go there I don't know but what I know is after that Simon three people came to me they gave me their number brother you know what I I really like the way that you preaching you know what this these are my numbers and I sent them over to my pastor and said you know what my pastor can actually help you you know better than I can I'm just here just to just to let you know and all these things happened then I moved to AR I started preaching on First Street met also friends there who were preaching on First Street and I would preach on First Street went to church met Pastor Chu from eastley who is the pastor for a satellite church eastley satellite church Ina one day he just calls me come brother and go and preach for us day for an all night we wa there and we preached and that's just a whole how this whole preaching and several Souls have come to the Lord through your Street Ministry they like do you have a few that you can tell us yes uh there's quite a few there's another brother called brother Simba brother Simba does not stay in guu he stays outside of gu but he was there because of school so he bothers me every time on my phone brother I no longer see you brother where are you brother you know all these things certain different people even in Harari I remember the last s that uh we preached on First Street it was the last Simon for last year on on Facebook it is there I was with brother Daniel Goda a friend of mine from Chim Mani came from from Chim Mani came to Har and said we I just felt like you and I should go there and just preach for just for the last time before the year ends we did and I that day I five Souls if I'm not mistaken five Souls came to the Lord Jesus Christ and so you can see there is fruit cuz you see by the B speaks of in the church age book of the way the pattern of every true Ministry and um how you are able to know that truly God has called you you see it has to be through that pattern like you know Paul was true to the word and uh you know we take the pattern of Paul because he was the first church age Messenger to the Lan uh to the to the Gentiles and so and and so he was sent to the eases but of course he was the one that opened the door for the Gentiles so we see that he was true to the word and also he he was a man of the spirit and as well as there was fruit in his ministry and so God manifested himself Vindicated him but also part of the Vindication is the fruit area exactly and you know if there is no fruit in what you doing then we don't we're not too sure if God has sent you or if God has sent you to so it's not about the maning God has sent you it's not even about you thinking or presuming it's about God confirming that I am with you I've sent you like he said I'll be with you and in you up to the end of the world up to the end of the world and so we see uh when it you know um I used to hear those testimonies oh I'm preaching on this street or I'm preaching on that street or this is happening or that is happening I was really encouraged by that and I really wanted you to come also to the meetings and uh it was very difficult but um you know at that last moment the Holy Spirit spoke to me vividly that I needed to invite you and and so that's why I did it I I don't usually do things uh just for just I usually do things even when I do not know why but if the Holy Spirit has told me I need to do this I do it and um to you who is hearing I know you've heard a few comments by the prince saying the Holy Spirit I'm saying the Holy Spirit you know God speaking God speaking and sometimes you've seen the message we don't want to hear such language but um the reason why I have had to say those comments as well is because I believe in the Holy Spirit and the work of the Holy Spirit and I know he speaks because the holy spirit is brother banam told us is not a thing he's a person and and he speaks so and if you do not know how he speaks you need to have an encounter with him and when you have an encounter with him once he will certainly speak to you in a way that you will understand and so uh I know it's been almost 2 hours and and uh we do not want to overstay and then the people will get tired especially those who will listen to this later on uh but do you have I have a few comments I wanted to read to you but before we do that uh and if anybody's following and you want to send a comment I'll read it while we are closing you can go ahead and do that maybe you can drop a comment on the on the chat here on on YouTube I'll read it maybe a message to brother Prince or anything uh you wanted to say something uh before we close okay yes before H many people will think that I'm a pastor no I not a pastor personally I don't believe God called me to be a pastor if there is one thing that I'm afraid of is being a pastor personally I just believe that I'm supposed to preach out there in the streets that's what I believe personally I'm just supposed you know just this guy that's what every preacher is supposed to exactly and number two the one one of the other ways of knowing that you are called of God in the Ministry you try to run away you try to say well I'm not anything I'm not even a preacher that's one of the ways we know cuz says the man that is fighting for it is not the man that is called for it but the man that is trying to run away the man that is that is the man for the job you see so that that's a clear sign my brother we've had you here minister to us and you've been a blessing twice you preached in our assembly and uh some pastors have also been informing me that they would want to hear you minister to them I know from here you'll also uh visit Kenya I know Saints from Kenya some of them will be watching this as well I know they'll be blessed by your ministry there especially having heard your testimony and uh I I personally really desired for you to speak to us and also share this testimony because young people need to know that this is not this is not something we've learned or this is not something that we are doing because um we are accustom to e this is an experience it's an experience we've gone through it is God that has made real uh this message to us and so it is something from the heart and not something from the head and uh also another thing that is significant there is to show that when God surely calls somebody and fills them with the w with the Holy Spirit and gives them an experience with him they'll be concerned see they'll be concerned uh it did not end like well then I became a very good church member you know and then when it happened I took to the streets I started Pastor s calls them good for nothing yeah there is a very good brother yeah but good good for nothing because he doesn't do don't be good for nothing do something for the Lord go on the streets and preach now we have YouTube go on YouTube get a channel preach sing do something for the Lord you know do tracks distribute them around the neighborhood even if you're assist you can distribute the St you can do do something for the Lord don't be too idle don't be good for nothing too good in the church but good for nothing do something for the Lord let us fire up this generation let let the people know let this generation know there are a people that are not like the world not in the world but we are not of the world and let them know that we have a message in the land God has sent a message a message of restoration let them know and who is going to let them know it is us yes sir it's not somebody coming from the moon or an angel coming with wings it is us that's right going to do that and so uh there there's somebody who was saying uh uh God Bless you that's a good testimony I think this is Brother Benjamin God bless you brother Benjamin someone was saying I'm touched by the warm testimony I felt God is telling me something God bless you your name is not so clear but at least you can know that the testimony has been a blessing to someone and God has been speaking to them and this is saying wow is this the brother uh is the brother still in Uganda yeah he still in Uganda I think these are the people who came to the meetings I remember the brother could sing oh yeah he could sing and yesu went in the world and sang and and the devil got him into trouble but Jesus took him out praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen uh he says that this is exactly what I wanted to tell brother Prince God called man always run away yeah yeah so your message has reached God called man always runs away and and that's the truth uh but they cannot run away forever the God will always uh get them back and I think this is the sister you were speaking to after the service uh that you refer to her little bit here I would not speak her name but you you remember her so she says pastor this is a private message to me I've got so convinced by this testimony I think I got a change and she's in tears I say if this is what it was all for then it's been worth it amen amen my sister if you you it's not a thought it is a revelation and inspiration that you have received and and we're going to pray for whoever that is struggling that uh God will be able to visit you like you visited our brother and brother I I really failed also to pray for you over something before we close uh that uh this after effect you know of whatever else you are in and you say that sleep the scripture says that God give gives his beloved sleep before we end this I'm going to pray that God will give you sleep in the night every night you will have if you want 12 hours sleep God will give it to you you don't have to take medicine for it you don't have to be worried cuz you see if it is restoration it has to be perfect restoration and there's a brother who says I mean I I just like the entire setup of this interview I just see a brother speaking his heart out to another brother wow God bless you and I said brother Jeffrey God bless you as well we really appreciate you and all the brothers and sisters that have been watching this so and I think we now need to pray I'm going to pray for you and you are going to pray for the listeners everybody else that has been struggling everybody else that has been going through things or maybe they've been going through things that you have uh or they going through things that you have been or you had been going through and I want you from your heart to speak to them your last words and also to pray for them from your heart that the Lord will do something for them okay thank you so much Pastor for the for the opportunity it has been really nice to be to be here and it if there's something that really touches my heart is to know that your testimony has touched another person amen you see God does those things for reasons that we might not know and I tell you today I used to regret this path that I had taken but now I don't even regret it because I know that the the footsteps of the righteous they ordered by the Lord yeah so what the the few words that I have got to say to you my fellow friends is that you have got to want the life you have got to want it you have got to confess it you have got to do things intentionally that self guard your salvation the Bible says work out your salvation with trembling and fear you have got to you see do not take this whole Christian uh life as a joke or as a job Christianity is not a job Christianity is life that's right Christianity is is clothed in blood you that's one thing that you have really got to be you know if God is jealous about anything in this world God is jealous about blood that's right to the extent that God said even the blood of animals you shall not eat it because there is life in the blood so if God is jealous about blood and this message is covered in blood if you take it for granted I tell you God will do something about it because he's jealous of blood people like Paul people like Peter people like Martin Luther people like a lot of those people those Saints of all they had to die for this gospel to mention even even God himself had to die for this gospel that we take so lightly as though it's something that I can do without you see please make a decision now before it is too late because there will come a time when you will want to make this decision but like Esau you'll seek for a place of repentance and find none while is it's still cold today before you even sleep if you have an opportunity to speak to your pastor if you have an opportunity to go to your parents and say mama I'm sorry please do it because tomorrow is not guaranteed to anyone of us so that's one thing that I've got to say to you you have got to want the life you have got to stay in prayer you have got to confess it you have got to do things to the best of your power there are some things that you have got to do Pastor God we believe God does things but there are some things that you have got to do yourself as a Believer that's right you see God will not come and wake you up in the morning at 3:00 a.m. and tell you wake up and pray youve got to make that decision yourself to wake up at 3:00 a.m. and pray you see you've got to make that decision to confess your life God will not confess your life for you you've got to make that decision yourself to say you go God I don't want this anymore I want to live a clean life you have got to go with your own two feet and sit before the pastor or the elder or whoever it is even though it is it is very shameful for you to do that but it's necessary for you to do that and with those words friends God bless you you richly and uh there is um a sister that says they've been blessed so much uh and sister by faith with all our family and uh also sister Canim me says God bless you brother I think she's in Boston uh we would like to have you now pray for uh perhaps somebody's watching now or they will watch this later but they need to break out of certain things like these maybe it's alcohol maybe it's a spirit of um you know you know drinking or or smoking or women or men or you know immorality and and you see they do not know how to break out of it they want to break out of it they do not know how to maybe what the prayer can do is to bring them to a place amen where God can begin to work on them amen you know I I believe that prayer changes all things you know in your story as you're speaking to us it was prayer that did it as much as you hearing the word as much as you went to church as much as it is prayer amen first the prayer of of Pastor of your pastor then Pastor Mah in in in South Africa and then now you and your friends you see so as you know the prayer you're going to pray now might be like the prayer of Pastor Mah amen when he came in guu he never found you you were in some other churches and you know doing some gigs right there which I don't believe that any believer any musician should really do gigs you know cuz we've seen how far it can take a person and while you are there the holy spirit moves him to remember you he he calls you were not even there I was not but he calls your brother and he prays over your brother M by proxy on your behalf and that prayer met you where you were yeah and while looking at the mirror there it was it struck you amen prayer moves like waves prayer changes bam says it's the greatest weapon that we have ever been given and it started all by prayer and while you're praying now it might be through the waves we just right here inongo and um we SE uh around you know on these benches and some people are watching us maybe from so far maybe in some other country maybe from you know I don't know we we uh by following our statistics we we a lot of people follow this Channel and and you know listen you know we hear from them back and forth some from you know as far as the US and you know Canada very many from you know those places some even sometimes from New Zealand and you know across Africa many countries and I know somebody might watch this and they have been going through something and and uh this prayer will be a point of contact for them for God to begin a miracle in their life a miracle of change that's the greatest Miracle a miracle of Salvation yes so you know just be led by God and we just humble ourself and you pray for that person let's pray precious gracious Heavenly Father we come before you with humbleness of spirit and Brokenness of heart Jehovah knowing that it is not of our own doing that we are here some of us Jehovah you dragged us from the mud when we did not even want I was not even prepared to come back Lord but you had to drag me back home Lord there is
