[0:24] welcome to Global answers please join us
[0:27] as we discuss the relevance of God's
[0:29] eternal word relating to events in this
[0:32] day and what it means to you and now
[0:36] your host Lonnie Jenkins Hello friends
[0:39] I'm Lonnie today we have a very special
[0:42] guest very old friend of mine uh Rend Ed
[0:46] bcll a missionary a pastor and many
[0:50] other titles and you'll get acquainted
[0:53] with him in a moment but first I wanted
[0:55] to tell you a little bit about reminding
[0:58] you about this age and himself so that
[1:01] you'll appreciate more what we're going
[1:03] into today we've spoken to you many
[1:06] times about a special message at the end
[1:08] time and how that God is going to unveil
[1:12] the mysteries of God in the last days
[1:14] and we know from the many many
[1:16] scriptures many of which we've rehearsed
[1:18] with you before that the word of the
[1:21] Lord comes to the prophet so God had to
[1:25] in restoration send a prophet and in
[1:28] that sending of a prophet Prophet it has
[1:30] to be from the scripture from the Bible
[1:33] otherwise he's just another man with
[1:35] another opinion of what's going on in
[1:38] the world today but when God sends a man
[1:41] he thoroughly vindicates I am with this
[1:44] man so consequently I wanted to talk to
[1:47] you just a moment now God uses this
[1:50] Spirit of Elijah five times Spirit of
[1:53] Elijah we're talking about now five
[1:55] times we find that it came on Elijah
[1:58] Elisha we know from scripture it came on
[2:01] John the Baptist and I'll jump one and
[2:04] in Revelations 11 we see the works of
[2:07] Elijah and Moses in a Ministry when God
[2:10] turns his heart back to the Jews again
[2:13] but in between those two is a Ministry
[2:16] of an Elijah to this age to forerun this
[2:18] second coming of the Lord to forerun
[2:21] what he himself called the coming word
[2:24] and so we can divide between these two I
[2:26] took the time to print out from my
[2:29] computer so that we could divide because
[2:31] most people uh tie together the
[2:35] scriptures that apply to Elijah of this
[2:38] age William brandham and the Elijah that
[2:41] came earlier which was John the Baptist
[2:43] so let me read to you just a few here
[2:45] now in Isaiah 40:3 it says the voice of
[2:49] him that crith in the wilderness prepare
[2:52] ye the way of the Lord and make straight
[2:54] a desert a highway for our God so now
[2:57] our first word I want you to watch now
[2:59] now the word is prepare Elijah was going
[3:03] to come and prepare and then we find
[3:06] many scriptures that refer to the
[3:08] concept that John came to prepare the
[3:12] way of the Lord because something new
[3:14] was coming then we're going to find
[3:17] other scriptures as I will read them to
[3:19] you in a moment that there word the word
[3:21] there is restore so restore is not
[3:24] getting ready for something new restore
[3:26] is take us back to something that was
[3:28] lost and bring us back to it so the next
[3:32] one then would be in Matthew
[3:36] 31 in those days John the Baptist
[3:39] preaching in the wilderness of Judea
[3:41] saying repent ye for the Kingdom of
[3:44] Heaven is at hand for this is he that
[3:47] was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah
[3:49] saying the voice of one crying in the
[3:51] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[3:53] Lord so now we Isaiah prophesied it and
[3:56] then here's the New Testament testifying
[3:59] John fulfill that he was the preparer
[4:02] Mark tells us the same thing in Mark 1:2
[4:06] the voice of one crying in the
[4:07] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[4:09] Lord ties it to John John the Baptist
[4:12] and then in Luke 3:4 as it is written in
[4:15] the book of the words of Isaiah the
[4:17] prophet saying the voice of one crying
[4:19] in the wilderness prepare ye the way of
[4:21] the Lord and we're right back to John
[4:23] the Baptist
[4:24] again and then in John 1:19 here's where
[4:28] it gets a little confusing but let's
[4:30] focus on it just a
[4:32] moment and this is the record of John
[4:35] when the Jews sent priests and Levites
[4:38] from Jerusalem to ask him who are you
[4:42] and he confessed and denied not but
[4:44] confessed I am not the Christ so he
[4:46] didn't deny he was anointed but I'm not
[4:50] the Christ you're looking for so that's
[4:52] why he confessed but denied not and they
[4:55] asked him what then are you Elijah and
[4:59] he said says I am not and I'll tell you
[5:01] why in a moment why he said that are you
[5:04] that prophet and of course Moses had
[5:06] spoken in Deuteronomy the Lord your God
[5:08] will raise up a prophet likened unto me
[5:11] he knew what they were asking that was
[5:12] Deuteronomy 18:15 and so he says no I'm
[5:15] not that one so they said who are you
[5:19] and then he quotes Isaiah again that he
[5:22] is that that voice in the wilderness now
[5:25] here we watch the transition scripture
[5:28] it's Malachi 4: five and six behold I
[5:31] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[5:34] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[5:36] of the Lord catch that now John did not
[5:40] come before the Dreadful day of the Lord
[5:43] we could call it a great day but it
[5:45] wasn't the Dreadful day of the Lord
[5:46] that's going into the tribulation the
[5:48] judgments of God the the day of the Lord
[5:50] is the day of Wrath if you just put
[5:53] quote day of the Lord if you've got a
[5:54] computer and run it through it'll bring
[5:56] up judgment and wrath of God being
[5:58] poured out on Earth then this Elijah now
[6:01] verse six and he shall turn the heart of
[6:03] the fathers to the children and we find
[6:07] in Luke
[6:08] 1:7 that that's ascribed to John the
[6:11] Baptist and then it says and the Heart
[6:14] of the children to their fathers now now
[6:17] here's another group that their heart is
[6:20] going to be turned to the fathers this
[6:21] is not parent child
[6:23] relationships this is the children of
[6:25] God in a certain age are going to be
[6:27] taken that word restore again
[6:30] back to the gospel that Paul preached
[6:33] the apostolic fathers and their their
[6:37] gospel and then in Matthew 17:10 and his
[6:42] disciples asked him saying after they
[6:45] had seen him on the Mount of
[6:47] transfiguration why then say the scribes
[6:50] Elijah must first come and Jesus
[6:52] answered and said to him Elijah truly
[6:55] shall first come and restore all things
[6:59] no noce future tense restore shall
[7:02] restore all things now that's a new word
[7:04] we've seen prepare now it's restore and
[7:08] then the next verse but I say unto you
[7:10] Elijah is come already so John the
[7:13] Baptist with the spirit of Elijah came
[7:15] but now but there is one to come who
[7:17] will restore so before the first coming
[7:20] of the Lord and the second coming of the
[7:21] Lord God uses that same Elijah Spirit
[7:26] to prepare or restore both both ways
[7:29] there's many connotations in invol
[7:32] involved here there's many more that
[7:34] I've got here but just to remind you now
[7:37] of First Corinthians 4:15 for though you
[7:40] have 10,000 instructors Paul says in
[7:43] Christ yet have you not many fathers for
[7:47] in Christ Jesus I have begotten you
[7:50] through the gospel so that's where we
[7:52] catch the idea that of the apostolic
[7:54] fathers and so in this Elijah Ministry
[7:58] that was to come God would obviously
[8:00] have to do something very very special
[8:02] to call the attention of the people to
[8:05] this ministry and Ed bcll that's here
[8:09] with us in the studio today was an
[8:11] eyewitness to much of this I was not I
[8:14] became aware of this Elijah Ministry
[8:17] just five months after brother brandham
[8:19] passed away though I had heard before
[8:21] but I had no understanding who he was
[8:23] just at very Supernatural Ministry but
[8:26] brother Ed was uh graced privileged to
[8:31] see the see this profit in operation and
[8:34] this ministry in operation and spend
[8:38] personal time uh with him on hunts as
[8:42] well as the more religious
[8:45] things and so brother Ed I'd like to ask
[8:48] you what was the sequence of events
[8:51] because I know you were a very young man
[8:53] when you were first exposed to this
[8:54] ministry what was the sequence of events
[8:57] if you can reach back and tell us
[9:00] that began to lead you to this concept
[9:02] that this was more than a normal
[9:04] anointed
[9:06] Ministry I guess brother Lonnie I would
[9:09] have to start at uh an early age of
[9:12] 14 it was when I was
[9:15] 14 there was a series of meetings that
[9:18] were taking place and of course I had
[9:20] never heard of the name William brandham
[9:24] there uh was a lot of Ministries which
[9:27] were uh r in at that time and uh my
[9:33] father and my mother stopped to take
[9:38] these services in uh it was during those
[9:42] meetings that I saw a blind girl and I
[9:47] was just very close to the front of the
[9:50] auditorium there was about 6 or 8
[9:52] thousand people
[9:53] there and the man who had introduced
[9:56] William brandham was ER Reverend ER
[10:00] Baxter and he said that this gift had
[10:03] come by a visitation of Angels or an
[10:06] angel of the
[10:08] Lord and that really caught my attention
[10:11] that night I saw that girl right before
[10:15] my eyes healed I saw her eyes straighten
[10:19] out and she was looking straight into
[10:21] the audience at that time brother Lonnie
[10:24] I
[10:25] became aware in my young heart that this
[10:29] Ministry was very different from any
[10:32] other that I had witnessed having grown
[10:35] up in a Christian home then some years
[10:38] later I became a
[10:40] minister I had been ministering about uh
[10:43] 7 years and during that time uh it was a
[10:48] a Revival of restoration which was
[10:51] really spreading throughout the world so
[10:53] the supernatural miracles of all kinds
[10:57] those things were quite in abundance now
[10:59] brother Ed what was the time sequence
[11:01] what date are we talking well we are
[11:02] speaking now from 1948 1958 oh yeah Big
[11:07] Revival time that's a big revival time
[11:10] and there are many names which are
[11:12] familiar today which came on the scene
[11:14] during that time and in fact many of
[11:18] them had their Beginnings really with
[11:19] the ministry of brother brandham he was
[11:22] considering considered an initiator of
[11:26] that great revival can I interrupt you I
[11:29] remember on a radio broadcast that you
[11:31] did you quoted from a book by Edwin
[11:33] Herold which I took the time to uh to
[11:36] get would you mind just reading to the
[11:39] people I've got it marked there for you
[11:40] but because you used it on a broadcast
[11:42] I'd be delighted because uh I I thought
[11:45] that Professor Harold put it in uh such
[11:49] a succinct manner when he said these
[11:54] words incidentally uh he put William
[11:57] brandham and or Roberts as the first two
[11:59] two uh Originators and the two giants of
[12:03] this revival now somebody had to spark
[12:06] the Revival be the torch and he did say
[12:09] that most of the people involved in that
[12:12] Revival in that great move of God which
[12:14] spread all over the Earth most of them
[12:17] considered William brandham as the
[12:19] initiator and he was the torch he was
[12:22] the torch which lit their made their
[12:24] fire Brands uh set of flame and he said
[12:28] this of
[12:30] him Branham seemed an unlikely leader he
[12:34] had long been a pastor in a small
[12:37] Independent Baptist Church he was
[12:40] introduced to the Pentecostal World by
[12:42] the despised oness
[12:44] Pentecostals his preaching was halting
[12:47] and simple beyond belief but William
[12:50] Branham became a prophet to a
[12:52] generation that was the phrase that
[12:56] really struck my heart uh when I read a
[13:00] man who wasn't not necessarily a
[13:03] follower uh of William banmore or any of
[13:05] these
[13:06] Ministries uh but he has described in a
[13:11] very brief few sentences what was
[13:15] happening and I traveled in Evangelistic
[13:18] work in Canada United
[13:21] States I found that there was a great
[13:24] deal of confusion amongst the ministry
[13:27] uh amongst basic things consequently I
[13:30] didn't have a clear understanding of
[13:33] very simple things such as baptism or
[13:36] the godhead and and I had good friends
[13:39] on you know that had various beliefs in
[13:42] that regard but as far as the
[13:44] supernatural was concerned there was a
[13:45] proliferation of that happening at that
[13:48] time now you but you you yourself were
[13:50] ministering in Pentecostal circles in
[13:52] many Pentecostal circles and so you were
[13:54] seeing other Supernatural than that of
[13:57] William brandham correct but yet
[13:59] something made William brandham stand
[14:01] Above the Rest that's what I'm
[14:03] interested in none of them none of them
[14:06] had not only the Declaration that an
[14:10] angel of the Lord which William brandham
[14:12] said right was the spirit of the Lord
[14:15] Jesus Christ amen and there was a
[14:18] presence and there were people from all
[14:22] walks of life journalists
[14:25] commentators people who wrote articles
[14:27] and magazines
[14:30] uh they declared that there was a
[14:32] presence a most unusual presence that
[14:35] would come down in those meetings not
[14:37] only that William brandham he did and
[14:40] said things uh that caught the attention
[14:44] of the people and no one else did that
[14:46] for example and I sat in the meetings
[14:49] and he would come to the
[14:51] platform 68 10,000 people and many more
[14:55] in other countries say how do you do
[14:58] friends and he would speak to the people
[15:00] for a few moments and then there' just
[15:04] be a a movement he'd raise his hand and
[15:08] say I take every spirit in this building
[15:12] under my control for the glory of God
[15:15] brother Lonnie it was just like a sacred
[15:18] hush fell over the people it
[15:23] was whether they were
[15:25] critics whether they were uh
[15:29] denominational ministers from all
[15:31] denominations and they sat behind him on
[15:33] the platform there was such a quietness
[15:37] but the thing that really set his
[15:38] ministry aside was the revealing of the
[15:41] secrets of the hearts of the people and
[15:45] even in my young
[15:46] Ministry and those men that I
[15:49] fellowshipped with we readily recognized
[15:52] this was a prophet of God because his
[15:55] ministry he didn't have to come and say
[15:57] he was his Ministry and what he did was
[16:01] a prophetic
[16:03] Ministry at first I must say we were
[16:07] enamored with the fact that it was such
[16:10] glorious it was so accurate it was so
[16:14] perfect we didn't see this in other
[16:16] Ministries we saw great things happening
[16:19] but not with the Precision and the
[16:22] accuracy person after person they would
[16:25] line up brother Lonnie and one person
[16:29] after the other tell them in detail even
[16:33] to their house number and their name
[16:37] over and over again he would some in
[16:40] some cases tell them what their real
[16:41] name was but say they call you this and
[16:45] give them the name that they're known by
[16:47] in the by the family such precision and
[16:50] that is what caught my
[16:53] attention but I would have to say that
[16:56] even all of the supernatural
[16:59] did not
[17:00] answer spiritual questions right and it
[17:04] was not
[17:05] until uh some years later that I had an
[17:09] opportunity to actually meet and be with
[17:12] brother brandham for two weeks and then
[17:17] I had the privilege also of setting up
[17:19] meetings for him we set up four meetings
[17:23] three days each sat on the platform saw
[17:27] people who I knew
[17:29] and I knew that he did not know them he
[17:33] gave the details of their lives of their
[17:36] sickness of their disease and it was
[17:38] just a a marvelous marvelous time but it
[17:43] was my privilege to be able to speak to
[17:46] him then uh concerning some questions
[17:50] which I had in my heart and have those
[17:53] answered by the scriptures okay now hold
[17:56] on hold your thought right there brother
[17:58] Ed I just want to mention something to
[18:00] the to the viewing audience when when a
[18:03] prophet of God can stand and tell you
[18:07] who you are where you're from what your
[18:09] sins were or whether you're healed or
[18:12] not healed it's not to exalt the man
[18:16] William brandham and say oh what a super
[18:18] duper he is that's not the concept the
[18:21] prophet speaks what God puts in his
[18:23] mouth so the concept is God knows your
[18:27] name God knows your address God knows
[18:29] your sickness God knows what you have
[18:31] need of and that would be the primary
[18:34] one of the reasons God would send a
[18:36] prophet and do such a thing to let you
[18:38] know God knows God cares and and it's so
[18:42] it's not to uh exalt the prophet per se
[18:46] it's to make God big and mighty in our
[18:49] in our midst and this ministry for me as
[18:52] surely done that please continue on
[18:54] brother Ed it has done exactly the same
[18:57] for me and I'd like to tell you
[18:59] and tell the listening audience where
[19:02] that had its beginnings and the
[19:04] questions that were so um so much on my
[19:09] heart and so deep on my heart and I had
[19:11] many many Godly friends Minister friends
[19:15] uh that were unable to really answer
[19:18] some very fundamental
[19:20] questions and what was taking place
[19:23] brother Lonnie was I I begin to see a
[19:28] decline
[19:30] I begin to
[19:31] see uh the the supernatural was present
[19:35] but the lives of the people and I'm
[19:38] including
[19:39] ministers was not comparable to the word
[19:43] of God and it troubled me I was very
[19:46] fervent about the scriptures I loved the
[19:49] word and when
[19:51] I would view men's lives and see that
[19:55] they could prophesy or perhaps speak in
[19:57] tongues or exercise gifts but their life
[20:01] did not line up with the word that
[20:03] troubled me very very deeply that was my
[20:06] first question to brother brandham and I
[20:10] asked him I said how can men be
[20:14] anointed I said I know what the
[20:17] anointing is and I can sense that they
[20:19] are anointed how can they be anointed
[20:23] and then their lives not line up with
[20:26] the word of God and brother Lonnie TR to
[20:28] a prophet's Ministry he didn't he didn't
[20:31] try to preach me a sermon he went
[20:34] directly to the scripture immediately
[20:36] and he said have you never read that the
[20:39] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[20:41] and I said yes I certainly have I've
[20:44] read it many times out of Matthew's
[20:48] gospel he asked me what is the
[20:51] rain I said well in the scriptures the
[20:54] rain speaks of the spirit he said
[20:56] exactly and the rain falls on the just
[21:01] and the
[21:02] unjust and I said yes I wasn't catching
[21:06] it yet but he said now the wheat and the
[21:11] tears they grew together in the same
[21:14] field he said brother Eddie you tell me
[21:18] what nurtured the wheat what did the
[21:21] wheat rejoice in and I will tell you
[21:24] what nurtured the tears and they grew so
[21:27] close together
[21:29] that the disciples said should we take
[21:31] up the tears no right don't take up the
[21:35] tears until the end time in the end time
[21:38] the tears and the wheat would manifest
[21:40] now I begin to see that we're growing in
[21:42] the same field enjoying the same the
[21:45] same environment but we're not of the
[21:48] same seed and then he went to a third
[21:51] scripture which was very very powerful
[21:53] for me and he asked for my participation
[21:56] he said when they on the day of
[21:58] Pentecost when the Holy Spirit
[22:01] fell Peter stood up and said that the
[22:06] the spirit of God shall fall upon All
[22:11] Flesh All Flesh but not all flesh is
[22:14] said is saved and when I begin to
[22:18] see that the rain falls and the just and
[22:20] the unjust in the last days sayth God
[22:23] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[22:26] and the wheat and the tears are growing
[22:28] in in the same
[22:30] field I I can only tell you that a
[22:33] thousand of my
[22:35] questions were suddenly answered my
[22:39] exact same experience for me when
[22:41] brother Brandon preached that sermon on
[22:42] anointed ones at the end time and the
[22:45] the era of Pentecost I was growing up in
[22:48] they used to have the saying God would
[22:50] never put his holy spirit on an unclean
[22:53] vessel but I was seeing the same thing
[22:56] you were seeing unclean lives but
[22:59] anointed and uh I was just as confused
[23:03] what is this but a prophet's message
[23:05] straightened the whole thing out and and
[23:08] there are two other there are two other
[23:09] examples that I think would be really
[23:12] valuable for the your viewers and that
[23:15] is Judas right which was one of the 12
[23:19] and he went with the 12 preaching
[23:23] everywhere and they came back rejoicing
[23:25] the great things that had taken place
[23:28] and miracles had taken place and he was
[23:31] right with Jesus carrying the bag right
[23:34] through uh into the communion table at
[23:37] the Last Supper and uh then was
[23:40] manifested MH then Caiaphas the high
[23:45] priest at that time prophesied that one
[23:49] must die for the people the prophecy was
[23:52] correct and he was the high priest he
[23:54] prophesied but he certainly wasn't of
[23:57] the correct s right the correct the
[24:00] scripture says because he was high
[24:02] priest so God used the office even
[24:06] though the man was a rascal yeah how
[24:09] often we see that today exactly yeah and
[24:12] then out of the Old Testament uh the
[24:15] Bible speaks and makes reference to
[24:17] Janice and jambre MH and how they
[24:20] withstood Moses so we can see the Janice
[24:23] and
[24:24] jambre the Judas in the New Testament uh
[24:28] we can see the anointed ones and the
[24:30] anointed ones at the end time the one
[24:32] thing that we have today is a
[24:35] proliferation of those who claim to be
[24:38] anointed and as as brother William
[24:40] brandham said to me they will not say
[24:44] I'm
[24:45] Jesus but they will say I'm
[24:48] anointed and the scripture tells us that
[24:51] in the last days and this to me clenches
[24:55] it many false christs shall arise and
[25:01] they're going to be successful and shall
[25:03] deceive many some are worried about you
[25:07] know a false prophet I I'm not worried
[25:10] about the one I'm worried about the many
[25:13] and when God promised in his word as you
[25:16] had spoken your introduction that God
[25:19] would send uh an Elijah Ministry a
[25:24] prophet with the word of God in his
[25:26] mouth I can say brother Lonnie if there
[25:28] ever was a day when that was needed it
[25:30] was in our time would you mind uh
[25:33] brother Ed elaborating a little bit on
[25:35] Christ because when we say false Christ
[25:38] many people think false Jesus is would
[25:40] you mind expanding on that J a little
[25:41] bit well not a false Jesus but because
[25:45] the there isn't anyone that would want
[25:48] to say I am Jesus or I am I am Jesus
[25:53] Christ but the the term Christ in
[25:56] association with Jesus Christ is that he
[25:59] was the anointed Messiah mhm and then we
[26:04] know that we are anointed MH we become
[26:08] anointed because the the spirit of God
[26:10] does anoint us but uh it when when the
[26:15] people came and Jesus said this many
[26:17] will come to me in that day and say did
[26:21] we not prophesy in your name did we not
[26:24] do many mighty works in your name and
[26:26] Jesus didn't deny that they did he
[26:29] didn't say you did not he said I never
[26:32] knew you mhm and so the the the fact
[26:36] that they uh had done many wonderful
[26:39] Works which they had and they had indeed
[26:41] been
[26:42] anointed but and they could say we are
[26:44] anointed and that is false Christ as
[26:48] Jesus termed
[26:49] it viewers you may recall in the
[26:52] scripture that it says that as Janice
[26:55] and jambes withstood Moses so will these
[26:57] of reprobate mind reprobate concerning
[27:00] the word anointed to power but not
[27:03] anointed to the word so will these in
[27:05] the last days they're going to confuse
[27:07] the whole issue so now again you're
[27:09] catching some of these Mysteries that
[27:11] we've been told you about that are to be
[27:13] revealed at the time of the end and
