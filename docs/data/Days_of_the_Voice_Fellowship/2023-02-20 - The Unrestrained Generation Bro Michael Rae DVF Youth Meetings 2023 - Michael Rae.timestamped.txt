[54:53] a lot of them that have not experienced
[54:55] what you have experienced
[54:57] [Music]
[55:01] but in the same time
[55:04] in every generation
[55:07] God will have a witness
[55:10] whether all the others will not overcome
[55:14] God will have a witness
[55:17] someone that will overcome
[55:20] someone that will overcome
[55:29] you know
[55:31] I do not know but I know my face
[55:39] [Music]
[55:41] someone will be bad
[55:45] into the group
[55:48] of the Overcomers
[55:50] I believe that with all my heart
[55:56] through this weekend
[55:59] [Music]
[56:01] and let us be prayerful
[56:04] as we're beginning these meetings
[56:08] really prayerful
[56:11] this is this is not a calling to young
[56:15] people to come and begin coupling and
[56:17] begin you know it's just not to just
[56:20] know one another
[56:23] [Music]
[56:24] baby
[56:28] it's not a is not a meetings of
[56:32] exchanging numbers when I say meetings
[56:34] it's not meetings of you one another to
[56:36] begin exchanging numbers and just you
[56:38] know you know you know being all over
[56:40] the place
[56:49] [Music]
[56:51] I believe it is my burden that I have in
[56:55] my house
[56:56] is that these are meetings
[56:59] of young people
[57:01] with the Holy Spirit
[57:05] so if that's not the purpose you came
[57:07] with
[57:10] I hope you don't get disappointed
[57:16] we will meet the Lord
[57:18] you will meet the Lord if you don't have
[57:22] the Holy Spirit
[57:24] we will receive the Holy Spirit
[57:28] it's an assurance
[57:30] because that's what that's what the word
[57:33] has told us
[57:35] so in these meetings
[57:41] by we are going to be spoken to by
[57:43] people by people by Brothers
[57:47] they brought the ministers
[57:52] these are people that have been changed
[57:56] I've had an experience
[58:00] in this message
[58:03] and all of them
[58:05] are younger ministers like you but where
[58:08] is
[58:11] so this is true send out a message to us
[58:14] [Music]
[58:17] that God is still moving
[58:22] and without wasting a lot of time
[58:26] I will be speaking more as the days go
[58:29] by
[58:31] we will be here this is our first
[58:33] service
[58:49] going to minister to us again
[58:54] brother Mike was being impacted by this
[58:57] message
[59:01] all his life away born
[59:05] I think he will give his own testimony
[59:09] but he has a wonderful question
[59:12] ever since we got to know one another
[59:15] we've become good friends
[59:18] our friendship really is around the
[59:21] message
[59:24] he has a minister to us here once yeah
[59:28] when days of the voice was still in a
[59:31] very little place this is still little
[59:33] but we were in a little a more little
[59:34] place
[59:39] and we were blessed by his ministers
[59:42] and I believe today
[59:44] we all will be blessed by his friends
[59:51] Michael Ray is a minister in
[59:57] um
[1:00:01] we just sat on our feet together
[1:00:14] I was thinking whether I should say this
[1:00:16] or not okay
[1:00:20] brother Branham
[1:00:22] was a prophet of God how many believe
[1:00:24] that yeah
[1:00:27] not many people in his time
[1:00:33] realized that he had a Ministry other
[1:00:36] than just a minister all right foreign
[1:01:08] is one of those that
[1:01:14] received the Revelation
[1:01:16] some of you who have listened to his
[1:01:18] testimony says it was on a log
[1:01:22] istics
[1:01:28] and I will not go into the details but
[1:01:31] that's when he went but speaking to him
[1:01:35] that's when the master met him
[1:01:39] he realized that this ministry was more
[1:01:42] than just a minister he was a prophet
[1:01:45] is
[1:01:49] preached this message and taken it to
[1:01:51] many countries
[1:01:55] and his generation and many in his
[1:01:57] generation did wonderful works

[1:02:15] the others overcame they stood for the
[1:02:19] world
[1:02:19] they did not tolerate any nonsense

[1:08:35] she scrubbed the floors
[1:08:40] so that a preacher could come in
[1:08:43] and preach special services
[1:08:48] and one little boy came to service
[1:08:52] and God got a hold of his heart
[1:08:55] and that little boy is
[1:08:58] and in his time he turned his world
[1:09:01] upside down
[1:09:04] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:09:08] maybe in this meeting there's maybe a
[1:09:10] little Dio Moody
[1:09:13] my little sister that'll get a hold of
[1:09:15] God
[1:09:16] that'll turn your community
[1:09:19] your area your city your country

[1:19:04] hindering your ability
[1:19:08] to run

[1:20:14] there's no way you'll even finish this
[1:20:16] race
[1:20:19] you got way too many hindrances
[1:20:25] the hindrance is the state of being
[1:20:28] interfered with and he seems
[1:20:31] foreign
[1:21:31] yeah try and run with those let alone
[1:21:34] [Applause]

[1:22:57] we have great intentions
[1:23:00] we have the best the best thought of
[1:23:03] what we're gonna achieve
[1:23:05] but too often something comes up
[1:23:09] and it hinders us from moving forward
[1:23:13] and have a little video
[1:23:16] and it's a bike race
[1:23:18] there's like a bicycle race
[1:23:23] and there's there's like hundreds of
[1:23:25] bites
[1:23:30] and so there's one there's a whole bunch
[1:23:32] of them they're riding really hard
[1:23:33] trying to run one free to win the race
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:37] and there's a spectator on the side a
[1:23:42] spectator
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:44] and all the bicycles are saying they're
[1:23:47] going this way they're they're running
[1:23:49] there yeah
[1:23:51] they're peddling that way
[1:24:17] and it derailed him he fell over here
[1:24:27] he came out of the middle of nowhere
[1:24:36] and so something came up and it stopped
[1:24:39] him from achieving what he was expecting
[1:24:41] yeah
[1:24:42] [Applause]
[1:24:45] anybody had ever had one of those types
[1:24:50] yeah you have made me have some great
[1:24:52] plans I'm gonna go interview to
[1:24:54] University
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:24:57] I have some I have some goals
[1:24:59] but something comes up
[1:25:02] and it stops it yeah
[1:25:06] anybody ever tried to do some kind of
[1:25:08] Maintenance project or whatever
[1:25:13] you know you go out there you need to
[1:25:14] fix something
[1:25:19] you
[1:25:22] [Applause]
[1:25:23] just don't you're not able to finish
[1:25:29] you know you're going to come out of
[1:25:30] this this weekend here not yeah
[1:25:33] and you're gonna come out refreshed
[1:25:37] we said that was an incredible set of
[1:25:39] meetings
[1:25:47] I'm not gonna lie the battle is gonna
[1:25:49] get hotter
[1:25:52] after this weekend
[1:25:56] bear pack s
[1:25:59] so you need to be aware of
[1:26:03] hindrances
[1:26:05] you go back to school you go back to
[1:26:09] work you get around your circle of
[1:26:11] friends you get around your co-workers
[1:26:14] and Satan's gonna start throwing in
[1:26:17] Temptations
[1:26:18] they are like the sign board
[1:26:24] as you're running the race
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:26:55] his amazing job
[1:26:57] this is a fantastic job
[1:27:00] making better money
[1:27:02] but you can't even get to a service
[1:27:07] that's a hindrance
[1:27:12] he'll throw in hindrances into the
[1:27:14] spiritual Realms imagination
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:31] he wages a Full Assault yes
[1:27:37] right here
[1:27:40] right in the mind
[1:27:42] because if you can plant a seed in your
[1:27:44] mind
[1:27:47] a little hindrance
[1:27:50] and it starts to grow
[1:27:53] starts to affect your home
[1:28:00] and that hindrance starts to impact
[1:28:04] it starts to affect come to a global
[1:28:06] position
[1:28:10] your spiritual growth
[1:28:15] and it creates a deformity
[1:28:20] I have a picture
[1:28:23] it was a
[1:28:25] carrotects a guy that someone pull out
[1:28:27] of a garden
[1:28:29] um
[1:28:39] and so the carrot and actually there's a
[1:28:41] ring in the dirt
[1:28:45] and the little seed just was dropped
[1:28:48] just so perfectly
[1:28:50] anyway
[1:29:00] and the ring then constricted
[1:29:13] [Applause]
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:44] because something constrained its growth
[1:29:53] that's what happens when something comes
[1:29:55] into mind
[1:29:59] it can create a complex
[1:30:05] a certain mental deformity no for that
[1:30:08] or whatever
[1:30:11] means rude
[1:30:13] and it hinders our growth
[1:30:18] brother Brown he says
[1:30:22] he says that you know of a night when I
[1:30:24] stand in front of men like this
[1:30:28] smart man to the ministry
[1:30:32] he says in me stand here
[1:30:36] knowing grammar school
[1:30:39] he says I have a complex truly
[1:30:42] entertainment
[1:30:45] brother Brown was stating here
[1:30:48] there were some real smart men yeah
[1:30:52] and he said I only know grammar school
[1:30:57] he said these men are far beyond my
[1:31:00] abilities
[1:31:04] he said I have a complex
[1:31:11] he says it's so easy to build a
[1:31:16] complexity he said another day he said I
[1:31:19] had an interview with brother away
[1:31:22] little gonna win he says a good man I
[1:31:25] don't want you but he built himself
[1:31:27] around a complex
[1:31:31] a kind of another complex
[1:31:35] he said it's just something a little in
[1:31:37] your mind
[1:31:40] you keep thinking a certain way
[1:31:44] he says go back and check it with the
[1:31:47] scriptures
[1:31:54] then go from there
[1:31:57] another place he says he says no wonder
[1:32:01] he says I'm an erotic
[1:32:05] because he's brother Brian would say
[1:32:07] he'd get nervous
[1:32:09] he says I have done this one thing
[1:32:14] instead of getting a
[1:32:16] complexion I tried to hold steady
[1:32:20] keeping my
[1:32:45] but if you leave it unchecked
[1:32:48] if you leave a complex unchecked it
[1:32:50] broke
[1:32:53] about a brand he talks about a Vine that
[1:32:56] will wrap around a stick
[1:32:59] yes
[1:33:12] because something hindered it
[1:33:15] he says but if you can remove that him
[1:33:20] that thing will grow straight
[1:33:25] amen and that's by God's grace tonight
[1:33:29] we need to buy God's grace remove the
[1:33:33] hindrances
[1:33:37] we needed pull them out because we need
[1:33:39] you you need to grow straight
[1:33:42] we need to grow strong in the world
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:45] we don't need nothing of the world
[1:33:48] laying inside of our Lives amen
[1:33:53] hey man so we're going to talk about
[1:33:55] strongholds
[1:33:58] because the hindrance is a stronghold of
[1:34:01] the Mind
[1:34:05] it takes a grip
[1:34:07] and holds you hostage
[1:34:11] scripture says for though we walk in the
[1:34:14] flesh
[1:34:15] do not war after the flesh for the
[1:34:19] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[1:34:21] But Mighty through God
[1:34:24] to the pulling down
[1:34:27] of strongholds casting down imagination
[1:34:33] and every High thing
[1:34:35] that exalted itself against the
[1:34:38] knowledge of God
[1:34:40] and bringing into captivity
[1:34:44] every thought
[1:34:46] to The Obedience of Christ
[1:34:50] amen that's the power that you have
[1:34:52] through this is to tear down
[1:34:56] the Captivity
[1:34:58] or should say cast down the imagination
[1:35:02] pull down the stronghold
[1:35:08] [Music]
[1:35:11] so now the strongholds
[1:35:15] it is a fortified place
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:20] it's built
[1:35:23] to put it it places a presence
[1:35:29] and a defensible position
[1:35:34] when someone with a King when he would
[1:35:37] build a stronghold
[1:35:38] [Music]
[1:35:40] it's there to to just make a statement
[1:35:45] it's so that his kingdom would look
[1:35:47] fortified
[1:35:50] and so a king would put a stronghold
[1:35:52] here in his territory
[1:35:54] and pretty now that he put another one
[1:35:56] there nobody
[1:35:59] I need to start to guard his borders
[1:36:04] with a stronghold
[1:36:07] it wasn't his main Castle
[1:36:11] but it would be a strong defense
[1:36:14] position
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:20] a man in a stronghold
[1:36:23] get stronger
[1:36:25] the more you put into it
[1:36:28] the more you build it out
[1:36:31] you know if he just built you know a
[1:36:33] puny little you know uh little bricks
[1:36:36] you know just super small and maybe yay
[1:36:39] high and I'm with my bow and arrow
[1:36:46] and I got a thousand man army coming
[1:36:49] against me
[1:36:53] and I have a little brick wall here
[1:36:57] and I've got my bow and arrow
[1:37:01] what kind of stronghold is that
[1:37:06] nothing
[1:37:08] but if I made a massive
[1:37:11] Stone Fortress
[1:37:14] that was that was 30 40 feet tall
[1:37:18] it was 100 feet wide
[1:37:22] and I filled it with all the the weapons
[1:37:28] and I made it so strong
[1:37:32] I have food in there I have resources in
[1:37:35] there
[1:37:37] and I put 50 men in there
[1:37:40] now I've got a strong
[1:37:43] man the more I put into it
[1:37:47] how stronger it is
[1:37:50] all right wow
[1:37:53] now the reverse works as well
[1:37:56] I should say the the negative also
[1:37:59] applies
[1:38:00] [Music]
[1:38:03] Satan wants to put a stronghold in your
[1:38:06] mind
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:08] he wants to build a defensible position
[1:38:11] against God
[1:38:16] and the more you
[1:38:19] know
[1:38:19] the more thought you put toward it
[1:38:23] the more you strengthen his position
[1:38:32] maybe a certain situation takes place
[1:38:36] maybe you're in a certain relationship
[1:38:39] and something hard
[1:38:42] it creates a hurt
[1:38:45] it creates an emotional bruise
[1:38:50] you start to think about that
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:56] you start to build a position
[1:39:00] amen Amina maybe maybe it's something
[1:39:03] you were raised somehow you were raised
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:09] maybe there was a death in the family
[1:39:14] something happens
[1:39:17] and it start you if you start to dwell
[1:39:20] on it
[1:39:21] [Music]
[1:39:27] certain emotions start to take a hole
[1:39:30] Amber and you dwell on that constantly
[1:39:33] constantly dwelling on that
[1:39:36] the stronghold is being strengthened
[1:39:40] there's better Brandon says you look to
[1:39:42] Calvary
[1:39:44] you give it to Christ
[1:39:47] job said the Lord gives and the Lord
[1:39:49] takes away
[1:39:51] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:39:54] he didn't dwell on that yeah
[1:40:02] but job wasn't allowing a stronghold to
[1:40:05] take place
[1:40:07] he had his he had his comforters come in
[1:40:11] he started to throw his thoughts at him
[1:40:16] he took courage
[1:40:19] he encouraged himself in the Lord
[1:40:24] I know my redeemer lives he didn't let
[1:40:28] that sorrow
[1:40:32] all his camels
[1:40:34] his donkeys
[1:40:37] he was stripped down to nothing
[1:40:41] but he said I set my face to Christ
[1:40:45] bless him be the name of the Lord
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:40:52] amen Amina and so now a person
[1:40:56] a person that allows a stronghold in the
[1:40:58] mind
[1:41:02] if they'll if they allow what happens is
[1:41:05] they start to become hindered
[1:41:13] and everything you now go through
[1:41:17] it's played through the lens
[1:41:20] [Music]
[1:41:24] of that stronghold
[1:41:27] so something happens
[1:41:29] maybe there's a certain relationship
[1:41:31] that breaks apart
[1:41:36] and you start and you letting anger
[1:41:38] starts to you you get angry about it
[1:41:44] and you just start to dwell on that
[1:41:47] and everything now is is is
[1:41:50] seen through that
[1:41:55] foreign you can have somebody that is
[1:41:57] maybe abused oh yeah
[1:42:00] yeah
[1:42:02] and they start feeling worthless
[1:42:06] in their whole life
[1:42:08] starts to be played through
[1:42:12] or lives through
[1:42:14] that stronghold
[1:42:18] and they dwell on that
[1:42:20] and it starts to create a fortification
[1:42:26] you need to take it to Calvary
[1:42:31] you start to say well nobody likes me
[1:42:34] they don't really know anything about me
[1:42:37] nobody even cares for me
[1:42:39] no one really wants me anyway
[1:42:42] and these thoughts start to rain in your
[1:42:45] mind
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:47] which are lies
[1:42:50] but it fortifies the devil's position in
[1:42:54] your mind
[1:42:57] and then when you start to hear a
[1:43:00] message preach
[1:43:01] and you're listening to maybe a a
[1:43:04] preacher preach
[1:43:06] and because that strongholds God so
[1:43:08] strong
[1:43:11] the preacher's speaking about how God
[1:43:13] loves you
[1:43:15] and it just starts bouncing off the wall
[1:43:19] the wall the stronghold of rejection
[1:43:23] stronghold of worthlessness
[1:43:26] yeah yeah well you just don't understand
[1:43:29] you don't understand my situation
[1:43:31] foreign
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:44:06] it's putting a barrier up
[1:44:12] and you become captive
[1:44:14] and scripture says
[1:44:17] you did run well
[1:44:22] who
[1:44:24] Satan did hinder you that you should not
[1:44:29] obey the truth
[1:44:30] [Music]

[1:44:38] is to build such a stronghold
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:41] that you didn't believe

[1:54:23] you have been commissioned
[1:54:27] hey man
[1:54:29] that means God put Authority on you
[1:54:32] when you're a commissioned officer
[1:54:34] in the Army you've been given certain
[1:54:38] authorities
[1:54:39] so you can walk into a certain situation
[1:54:43] oh that's an officer he's been given
[1:54:47] certain authorities
[1:54:48] commissioned to do a certain work amen
[1:54:52] you've been commissioned to do a certain
[1:54:55] work however you've been given Authority
[1:54:58] not your daddy's not your mamas not your
[1:55:03] pastors you also our commissioned would
[1:55:07] you defeat the enemy
[1:55:10] [Applause]
[1:55:12] foreign
[1:55:12] [Applause]
[1:55:20] 's gonna throw it at you
[1:55:22] but God's Army
[1:55:24] is to cast him out
[1:55:33] you say well brother Michael how do I do
[1:55:36] that yeah
[1:55:39] let's talk about it construction amen
[1:55:44] foreign
[1:55:54] we're gonna lay Siege
[1:55:56] yeah
[1:55:58] you know what a Siege is ah it's just
[1:56:01] it's saying
[1:56:03] a Siege you when you surround something
[1:56:05] a Siege
[1:56:11] is Israel when it came to Jericho
[1:56:17] they started to March around the walls
[1:56:21] who knows in the days of Jerusalem after
[1:56:24] Jesus was ascended
[1:56:29] when Titus came in
[1:56:32] do you know that
[1:56:34] Titus came in and he surrounded
[1:56:38] Jerusalem
[1:56:40] he laid Siege
[1:56:45] to Jerusalem
[1:56:48] nothing could get in
[1:56:50] nothing could get out
[1:56:52] foreign
[1:57:00] because a fortification
[1:57:04] a stronghold it should go a hindrance of
[1:57:08] your mind
[1:57:10] is only able to succeed
[1:57:13] it's only able to uh to be strong
[1:57:19] if you can get resources in Singapore oh
[1:57:24] I didn't get it get it that's okay
[1:57:27] we're gonna get it hey man
[1:57:30] if you build if there's a stronghold or
[1:57:32] a fortress
[1:57:35] it needs food
[1:57:37] it needs water
[1:57:40] it needs weapons
[1:57:42] it needs people
[1:57:44] and those people need to eat need to
[1:57:48] drink we need to be able to fight
[1:57:51] but a Siege
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:54] stops the inflow
[1:57:59] so a caravan
[1:58:04] can't come along
[1:58:06] and give resources
[1:58:09] to the strongholds
[1:58:11] amen you follow okay so if you put a
[1:58:16] Siege around it
[1:58:18] nothing can come in it's blocked okay
[1:58:23] man so when Titus went around Jerusalem
[1:58:27] nothing could come in so they
[1:58:51] it's a terrible situation
[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:58:55] but that's how you defeat a strong City
[1:59:01] the first time that that tactic
[1:59:06] you hear in the scripture
[1:59:08] is Jericho
[1:59:14] the angel of the Lord told Joshua
[1:59:18] how to defeat
[1:59:21] a strong fortified
[1:59:25] he says oh my goodness
[1:59:27] that Jericho is huge yes the walls are
[1:59:31] you know many many feet thick
[1:59:34] it's impossible to get in there
[1:59:38] my problem in my mind
[1:59:41] was a hurt in my life
[1:59:43] difficult situation I'm going through
[1:59:46] better energy
[1:59:49] it's too massive it's the biggest
[1:59:53] stronghold ever it's like Jericho
[1:59:57] but I'm here to tell you there's a
[2:00:00] Joshua
[2:00:01] that gave the way what were you what you
[2:00:05] need to do to defeat Jericho
[2:00:10] amen
[2:00:18] we're gonna surround
[2:00:20] we're gonna surround your enemy tonight
[2:00:29] amen amen you ready you're ready you
[2:00:33] have to want to or you're not young you
[2:00:36] have to want to deliver be delivered
[2:00:39] don't you be holding that back
[2:00:43] you gotta let the door a pride
[2:00:47] but I don't want people to know my
[2:00:49] problems
[2:00:50] I don't want it to be exposed
[2:00:53] expose it tonight tell the devil what
[2:00:57] you here
[2:01:01] and I'm gonna allow the army of God
[2:01:04] to surround you now because tonight is
[2:01:08] the night of Deliverance
[2:01:15] amen yes sir
[2:01:20] you say it sounds complicated
[2:01:22] it sounds complicated
[2:01:27] that's the devil talking to you
[2:01:30] [Music]
[2:01:33] Joshua Yeshua he started to go yeah he
[2:01:37] said hurry Joshua
[2:01:39] go around the city
[2:01:41] and March around
[2:01:44] just keep marching around
[2:01:47] hey man man he said that sounds really
[2:01:50] simple
[2:01:52] exactly
[2:01:54] it's that simple
[2:01:57] he marched around the city for seven
[2:01:59] days
[2:02:01] then they blow their trumpets
[2:02:04] they were surrounding the city
[2:02:07] with obedience to God's word
[2:02:10] amen with faith
[2:02:13] and with praise
[2:02:22] amen and the power of Faith
[2:02:28] well they walked around that City
[2:02:31] they might not have been quite ready on
[2:02:34] day one
[2:02:36] but they started walking around the
[2:02:38] world
[2:02:39] they started pondering he's the god that
[2:02:42] opened the Red Sea
[2:02:44] he's the god that brought plagues
[2:02:48] he's a God that brought us out of Egypt
[2:02:51] he's the god that drunk Quail on us he
[2:02:55] gave us Mana when we needed it yeah
[2:02:57] opened the Rock and gave us water they
[2:03:00] started to ponder
[2:03:02] their face started to grow as they
[2:03:06] started to March a while in the walls of
[2:03:08] his head
[2:03:09] you might need to walk around your wall
[2:03:12] a little bit and start rehearsing but
[2:03:15] your God is done you start speaking
[2:03:18] about oh my god he has saved me he's
[2:03:22] delivered my mama there he delivered my

[2:37:03] amen Amina amen as we close
[2:37:08] I wanted to end with this
[2:37:12] I had a video
[2:37:14] and I'll just dramatize it for you
[2:37:20] I believe it was in 1996.
[2:37:24] at the Barcelona Olympics
[2:37:27] [Music]
[2:37:29] and there was a runner
[2:37:33] and he had he had missed out
[2:37:37] from a prior Olympics
[2:37:43] he hadn't qualified
[2:37:48] but this Olympics in Barcelona
[2:37:53] Barcelona he was doing really good
[2:37:57] he had ran a couple races
[2:38:00] and he was performing really well
[2:38:03] and so he was in the semi-final
[2:38:08] I think it was the maybe the 400 meter
[2:38:12] something like that
[2:38:15] and he was running he was going at a
[2:38:16] good pace
[2:38:19] and you see in the video he's running
[2:38:22] got a good stride
[2:38:25] and he said that something popped
[2:38:30] and he felt a pop now
[2:38:35] and his hamstring had torn
[2:38:37] um
[2:38:40] and you see him stop cause you again
[2:38:44] she goes to the ground
[2:38:47] and everybody starts passing
[2:38:51] and he's down he's in pain
[2:38:54] foreign
[2:39:00] a vital part of his leg
[2:39:05] barely even move he's just kind of
[2:39:07] cringing
[2:39:10] maybe tonight
[2:39:13] maybe you're mine and the words
[2:39:16] Satan is
[2:39:23] and he stood there on the ground
[2:39:26] but his mind went back
[2:39:30] when he couldn't run the prior race
[2:39:39] he said in his mind I have to finish
[2:39:41] this up
[2:39:47] and in your mind tonight
[2:39:49] some vital part of your spiritual walk
[2:39:52] has received a snap somehow wow
[2:39:56] but your mind is thinking about the
[2:39:58] scriptures that we just talked about
[2:40:00] tonight
[2:40:10] and something happens
[2:40:13] he gets up now you will come and he
[2:40:16] starts
[2:40:17] it starts to go now
[2:40:20] I ain't stopping now guys and what
[2:40:24] happens is
[2:40:25] out of the crowd

[2:40:33] father

[2:41:02] they try to shoot his father away he's
[2:41:06] got to go at this all alone
[2:41:09] and his father
[2:41:17] and he takes his son in his arms
[2:41:20] and the officials come out to get a
[2:41:22] stretches

[2:41:29] I'm not down enough I'm
[2:41:32] finishing this course
[2:41:35] [Applause]
[2:41:37] if a natural father
[2:41:38] [Applause]
[2:41:40] if a natural love for a son
[2:41:44] away would be willing to run down there
[2:41:47] see his child
[2:41:50] in a difficult moment
[2:41:52] it's like he doesn't look like he's
[2:41:54] gonna finish

[3:15:17] and then we will break off for tonight
[3:15:24] amen Amina
[3:15:26] so this is a three-day meetings
[3:15:31] so this is our first meeting of course
[3:15:35] and then we are going to have a full day
[3:15:38] tomorrow
[3:15:40] and then we have another full day on
[3:15:43] Sunday Nissan
[3:15:45] like I said this is just the beginning
[3:15:52] but it's just the beginning
[3:15:55] so we have a lot of fisting to do
[3:15:59] let us step radar
[3:16:05] amen I mean I know that most of us or
[3:16:08] most of you
[3:16:11] will be staying now I want to say that
[3:16:15] when we when when I failed to call these
[3:16:18] youth meetings
[3:16:21] I did not plan it to be
[3:16:24] um
[3:16:25] I did not plan it to be a camp
[3:16:27] morning I did not plan for it to be
[3:16:29] resident meetings
[3:16:32] so I did not expect that that will
[3:16:35] happen
[3:16:36] it wasn't my plan at all
[3:16:40] of the Lord
[3:16:42] and you notice some of you who received
[3:16:45] the invitation the first flyer that went
[3:16:46] out
[3:16:49] we didn't even have any camp fee on it
[3:16:54] will just come and feast on the world
[3:16:56] and then go back to our house
[3:16:59] and I thought that only the groups young
[3:17:03] people from around Kampala will just
[3:17:04] come and join us
[3:17:09] but uh how many how many here at this
[3:17:12] time are not from out of Kampala just
[3:17:16] raise up your hands
[3:17:20] how many here when they come on have
[3:17:23] come from outside Kampala about food
[3:17:25] they will work just raise up your hand
[3:17:27] up high
[3:17:28] yeah
[3:17:29] this is the fastest so you can see the
[3:17:31] number okay
[3:17:33] and so I noticed uh when the flyer went
[3:17:37] out we started receiving calls
[3:17:41] of young people who wanted to come and I
[3:17:44] mean
[3:17:45] they won't be a part of the meetings
[3:17:48] so I thought what are we going to do
[3:17:51] some short notice
[3:17:55] we've not prepared to do this
[3:17:59] expensive to do this
[3:18:02] and we were not prepared at all
[3:18:14] I told them I think we should do this
[3:18:18] we don't have the resources
[3:18:23] and then the restroom shall leave to the
[3:18:25] Lord
[3:18:27] and so I could not begin to call Brother
[3:18:32] Isaac who is going to come and Minister
[3:18:33] and say brother Isaac sent me money I
[3:18:35] prepare youth meetings
[3:18:40] I could not ask brother brother brother
[3:18:43] Michael to send me money to prepare
[3:18:45] youth because
[3:18:50] that God if God wanted this
[3:18:53] God must provide
[3:18:56] and I know God will provide
[3:19:01] to make this a success because this is
[3:19:04] not my work okay
[3:19:09] and so we prepared we we incidentally
[3:19:12] have a school close by here
[3:19:16] and uh spoke to the owner of the school
[3:19:19] and they were willing to give us
[3:19:23] they were willing to give us hostels
[3:19:27] for the for the for you to to camp at
[3:19:33] and all this was on short notice
[3:19:37] but uh they at a fee they were able to
[3:19:40] give us those hostels
[3:19:43] and so we thank God that we were able to
[3:19:45] secure that
[3:19:48] and so we decided to set a fee you take
[3:19:51] our own
[3:19:52] and that really is not going to take
[3:19:55] care of you a hundred percent
[3:20:05] and uh I know that also many of you
[3:20:09] have told us that you're not able to pay
[3:20:11] that fee
[3:20:14] but we said still if you would like to
[3:20:17] come just come and how the Lord
[3:20:26] and um
[3:20:34] we have a a full schedule tomorrow
[3:20:37] in chair tuner program uh Institute of
[3:20:42] Asia
[3:20:44] we will be having and if you want to
[3:20:46] have to write on a piece of paper that's
[3:20:48] okay
[3:20:49] this is out on the fly on the website
[3:20:52] you can actually check it out
[3:20:55] so that you can get the whole program
[3:20:58] those of you who are not going to be in
[3:21:00] the hostels
[3:21:04] so
[3:21:06] in the morning very early here we're
[3:21:08] going to be here at 6 30.
[3:21:11] so even those of you who are
[3:21:14] non-residents and you'd like to be here
[3:21:15] at that time
[3:21:19] for the morning devotion
[3:21:22] you are welcome it will be one hour
[3:21:26] there will be some little preaching for
[3:21:29] about 30 or 40 minutes
[3:21:33] and we have a very wonderful young man
[3:21:39] who is going to minister to us tomorrow
[3:21:41] in the morning devotion again
[3:21:46] amen God linked me up with this young
[3:21:48] man some many years ago in Nairobi music
[3:21:54] and at that time he was not a preach of
[3:21:58] course
[3:21:59] but the desire to serve the Lord
[3:22:03] and you come tomorrow and see what the
[3:22:05] Lord
[3:22:12] and that's what that's what he will do
[3:22:14] in us as well I believe
[3:22:16] so our brother Ken has a wonderful
[3:22:18] testimony and I wouldn't want you to
[3:22:20] miss it for anything
[3:22:23] so then after that we shall have the
[3:22:26] main service beginning at around nine
[3:22:28] hours
[3:22:32] and then we will have a second service
[3:22:34] services
[3:22:40] at around this time
[3:22:43] that is for tomorrow and on Sunday
[3:22:49] amen Amina
[3:22:57] so this is the north those who have not
[3:22:59] registered especially ministers must
[3:23:01] register before going
[3:23:03] away

[3:23:10] for the meals
[3:23:13] not registered and and you're going to
[3:23:16] be around especially during lunch
[3:23:17] tomorrow we need to know we need to know
