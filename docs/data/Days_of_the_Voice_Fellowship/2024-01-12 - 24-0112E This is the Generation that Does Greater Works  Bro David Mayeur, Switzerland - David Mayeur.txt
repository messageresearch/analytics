with all that is within me that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen when I was coming um looking to Uganda it says that the people are generous and welcoming who what a blessing you are what a blessing you are It also says as Uganda is the pearl of Africa I know brother Basu is proud of Uganda but let me tell you something the government can call it the pearl of Africa but what they miss to see is that by God's grace I am standing before a portion of the pearl of Africa The Chosen the elect a portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's the Pearl that is all over the world Amen It also says about Uganda that there are about more than a thousand species of [Music] birds and here again the government the politicians they missed the essential part because here this weekend I'm talking to a portion of of of birds there are eagles there's a gathering of Eagles going on so don't worry about the thousands and so on I'm an eagle and what does an eagle do the word of God tells us there were whosoever the carcases wheresoever the carcasses there the Eagles gather what is the carcass amen and who are the Eagles have Eagles here tonight the carcass is the word of God and the Eagles feed on the word of God Amen and the true nature of a bird will show itself amen it will feed on the true word of God the prophet of God tells us where the carcasses the Eagles gather you don't have have to pump up a Revival you don't have to pump up anything we don't have to excite you we don't have to pump you up because I heard Mama Eagle cry and I'm responding to the word of God it's not an excitement it's a reality I'm watering the word of God with my Praises with my Praises with my hallelujah amen that's what Eagles do amen amen listen how the only thing you have to do the only thing you have to do is just come to the Fountain it's always full of good fresh water and there is no end to it saints of God these meetings were ordained by God just come to him come to the Fountain of Living Water and drink and drink and drink there's fresh model without limit hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen amen it just keeps on bubbling it just keeps on bubbling amen so don't worry like brother B said you won't disturb me with the shouting with the worship with the dancing running in the aisle the prophet tells us I've never never seen anything out of order when the Holy Spirit [Applause] starts Have Thine Own Way Lord amen amen there's something about young people and the good news is we're closer to the young people meeting in this C soon I'll have a body changed no more gray hair no more pains in my bones we'll all have we young again but listen there's something about young people the prophet of God tells us I'm beginning to get old you know my days are numbered but know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord hallelujah I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah we know that the Lord has gone to Glory but his spirits return back to carry on the message until he comes that's what these meetings are about amen amen may God have his way in these meetings is my prayer amen amen amen so I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen why don't we [Music] stand that was just to warm up Hallelujah you know there where

Greater Works and I'm one of them I'm that generation you know the prophet of God tell us as long as Satan can make you put things in the future that is Catholicism now let me ask you a question is anybody here Catholic please come forward we pray for you because the Catholics want to put it in the future the Lord will deliver me the Lord will fill me the Lord will heal me no no no no no faith is now now is my time to receive my blessing Hallelujah it all depends on you now let me ask you I'm just putting a foundation here amen amen thank you brother B oh it's open sorry I'm going to need that so now how much are you willing to give not to Brother David not to brother Timothy how much are you willing to give to God brother brandham tells us he says give him the best of your life give him the best of your songs give him all your talents give him everything you got give him your feet give him your hands give him your eyes give him your mouth give him your ears give him your soul give him your heart give him your praise give him everything you got Hallelujah that's what God's expects us to give but when you give praise to the word of God something is happening the word starts growing hallelujah amen it ain't an emotion it's a reality the word become stronger and strong Hallelujah there's no place here for Satan for anyon like my precious brother on precious friend would say stupid devil saints of God saints of God we didn't come for a picnic here This Means War God didn't send brother Timothy things and the Servants of God just to have a good meeting no no no no God wants to perform the miraculous phenomenal the superatural have th own way Lord so how much are you willing to give the only gift you can give that's yourself I Give Myself Away [Music] Lord you know we just had Christmas I know it's not the right date christas has to be every [Music] day and the prophet of God tells us these wise men are clearly identified they're offering their gift to him it showed that in their hearts they knew who he was there's a revelation there they knew who he was and it ain't over look what the prophet says and what he was going to do for them my Saints I'm asking you tonight how many have a revelation amen not something I think so I so I know and I know I that he is here the one that will bless me the one that will fill me the one that will heal me hallelujah hallelujah amen so the first thing they did they fell down before Jes Jesus let's get all our proud PR away let's humble ourselves I need the Lord Lord if there is is if there ever was a time that I need God now don't put it to tomorrow Hallelujah and then they presented their gifts that's the way to have a real Christmas he said worship him then present your gift you present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God so my prayer for each and every one of us is that we give All to Jesus you know those three wise men they brought gold de frankincense speak of service Mir speaks of that Mir speaks of death L Death the prophet says God deity in service to die listen out to their re what the Revelation they had the very they brought identified what they thought he was so what is it to you Saints how many have a need here how many came with a great expectation now what are we willing to give to our Lord what do we believe he is for us is he a Healer yes he is is he a deliverer yes he is is he a savior yes he is Dan let me tell you what a Mighty service meetings we will have the word of God tells us let us prophesy again speak the word only believe all things not possible amen Romans 8 Romans 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are sons of God for he have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry [Music] father the spirit itself bear with us with our spirit that we are the the children of God and if if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Christ it so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now are we the sons of God 2 Timothy 1:7 says God had not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind now we know how Satan likes to come around the prophet says there's only two elements that you can be controlled by that's either Faith or doubt fear will will accompany doubt but what what were the words that Jesus gave us after he conquered hell death and the grave fear not fear not God keeps his word no matter what the condition you are in tonight no matter what condition you are in tonight fear not only believe the greatest hindrance in the church says the prophet is fear they are afraid that it won't work Brother David went to many meetings and I believe and and and I went again the word of God God tells us fear not don't doubt but only believe until a baby cries until when until he satisfi brother Brown says that's the only thing he can do that's the only thing he can do I need you Lord I need another refilling Lord I Need touch from you Lord so let's cast down the demon of fear the demon of Doubt amen amen what I'm trying to do says the prophet what I'm trying to do tonight to drive that fear away how by God's word that's why we preach nothing else but the pure word of God Amen the prophet of God even cause fear the greatest curse the greatest curse God gave us an open book all the Mysteries are revealed so we can have a perfect faith in the perfect word and Faith cometh by hearing now what are you afraid of you that are born again you should be happy and carefree hallelujah amen the news May say that the pope is now agreeing with homosexual marriages so what we are seeing God's word being manifested before our eyes Hallelujah but let me tell you the word that concerns me is also manifesting itself right now right here so we should be happy and Care Free hallelujah hallelujah you know fear is a lack of confidence but God wants his church not just as a member let me make it a little broader God doesn't want people I believe the message I read the message no no no I am the message I am the word I am in the message the message is in me I am the word the word is in meu forgive me if I go to how many speak English oh my okay forgive me brother but hey there's a fire burning charity never fails and love cast out fear may God have his way amen amen now listen Amnesia that's what happen spiritual Amnesia cause you to be in a place where you cannot identify I go to church I go to service oh yeah I believe the word but will God will he be able to do something for me let me tell you right away he can do above and beyond what you can't even think of what you can't even think and expect because we serve a mighty God that is the same for us tonight worry you know fear causes worry worry has no virtue worry has no virtue brother Bram says just skip worry and accept Faith listen worry never want a battle worry never stop pain wor he never healed me wor he never delivered me wor he never brought my Mountain down worry never gave me an answer worry never brought me back home but faith in the unfailing word of God can do the miraculous amen that's the God I serve hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah listen how brother Bram says don't you worry sister don't worry about the cancer you know with every sickness comes a demon of fear we don't have to live like that any longer Satan wants us to be in such a situation where we accept the condition well here we are Saints we are here to declare war and claim every god-given privilege under what Authority Brother David The Authority God gave us in Jesus name we have the victory in Jesus name we C down every demon glory to God hallelujah hallelujah don't worry about the cancer you have you have a cancer bothering you but if you have faith God will heal you have faith and God will make you well you know the worst thing that Satan can put upon you is fear if you even had a cancer says and you didn't fear the devil he tries to put that on you but if you believe God would heal you you wouldn't be in too bad a shape what does that [Music] mean I'm not minimizing cancer but you know some people glorify the demon I'm just putting Demons back into their place where they belong where they belong the prophet of God tells us when the postman comes knocks at your door and he wants to give you a package you have the right say no no no get it back get [Applause] it I am a Son of God I a child of God hallelujah so you wouldn't in too bad a shape you wouldn't be in too bad shape that means even if you have cancer even if you have a sickness you can still worship God because I know in the God that I believe I know who I believe is greater than any sickness Hallelujah yes sir Glory Glory Glory not in too bad shape the word of God just told us we are sons and daughters that gives me reason to shout brother that giv me reason to thank God a man is sinner but I'm saved by his grace amen why did he choose me I can't tell you I don't know why Jesus but oh I'm so glad that he did me hallelujah hallelujah God hallelujah John 14:10 not that I am in the Father the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that in me he do it the works now remember my title this is the generation of those that do Greater Works the generation that does the Greater Works not my works but Jesus dwelling in me believe me verse 11 that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake I sayto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall give also Greater Works than these shall you do Mark 16 17 and these signs shall follow in my name they shall speak Mark 16 is one of the most debated scriptures you know why because there are not many people anymore that believe that word but I'm sure thankful to God that there are some true Servants of God believe this scripture that applies for us to tonight Hallelujah we sng only believe that was the song that the angel of the Lord loved because he knew if you can only believe what does it say all things how many say with me all things are possible Hallelujah faith is Burly the greatest enemy faith has is hope I hope I make it brother brother I hope I will get healed I will get delivered uhuh let me let me quote you the prophet when you say I hope I made it you've already made it amen you've already made it the word was spoken the fountain is Flowing freely but it's up to us just to drink I need a refreshment are are youing don't miss him brothers and sisters don't miss him amen youve already made it I never made it he made it for Me by his stripes I am already here by his grace I am saved another example brother Bram says he talks to a sister you have something wrong with your ear that's the bad part he says there comes a dark shadow you're scared cancer on the brain so we're not talking of humanly speaking or in a medical language cancer in the brain what does the doctor say we can't do much but what does my Bible say by his stripes I am already heal he has already done it I believe it oh but Brother David let me deal with that demon I had a friend and he died of cancer so what don't give any opportunity to Satan to speak Satan's language speak the word of God the demon has to flee God still heals cancers hallelujah hallelujah yes he still heals cancer listen to what he says amen there comes a dark shadow you're scared don't be scared you're standing in the presence of him right now and he knows you God bless you brother on he knows you glory to God how could you ever be afraid saints of God before even you came in this he was here a half an hour before hallelujah amen and he's here right next to you he knows you so why would you be afraid why would you doubt God called you to be the generation to do the greater work H glory be to God he knows you how could you ever be afraid listen sisters listen Brothers you know what the prophet says he didn't have a long prayer he he didn't even lay on hands he says it won't bother you now go on your road you're going to be all right hallu Hallelujah glory amen what's the secret what's the secret exactly what he told that sister your faith does die glory to God hallelujah hallelujah go be with you and God be with you and bless you Faith claims it right now you know what faith says God says it and it's mine Hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah Saints without the Shadow of Doubt these meetings are not ordinary meetings not because brother Timothy is here or Brother David is here God has an appointment with [Music] you oh Hallelujah yes Lord if thou can believe all things are possible I know Satan is Raging right now try to play with your mind but when Satan comes around with doubt fear answer him with faith I don't know how I don't know when but I know God the God that I [Applause] serve he is the great God [Music] my he is the captain of our Salvation if you're not saved yet you can't get saved [Music] now he is here if he can tell a little sister true vessel brother BR saying he knows you I may not know you but I'm representing a god it's all about you know your deepest desire and I'm a living witness that God is alive hallelujah hallelujah he's the captain of our Salvation hallelujah hallelujah what is salvation Deliverance Deliverance of what of these change of bondage bondage of what fear anxiety any sickness you name even fear of worship God inhabits the praise of his people that means when there is true worship be assured he is there oh he is all around that he's keeping me alive it's Jesus that is keeping me alive it's the holy ghost that is keeping me alive keeping me alive he keeping me alive hallelujah amen yes sir hallelujah hallelujah Deliverance so is deliv he is the captain of our deliverance in Jesus name we break every chain amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now listen the prophet tells us the great hour of charge is at hand what that great hour of charge pull your swords iy every demon of Hell by the authority of the word of God Jes receive your portion receive your healing receive your deliverance but it's the hour of your charge you name it you claim it Hallelujah and God will give it you are the generation that does the greater hallelujah amen oh hallelujah hallelujah stand at your post of Duty I won't bow down I will not Bend I will not accept what Satan tries to put on me I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah you know Saints in meetings like these where God is present all things are Amen Brother David is it just a a fairy tale no believe me I've seen God move too many times some people think you know brother Bram is gone it's done for us no let me just tell he played his part of the scripture now it's our turn he shall never leave us Jesus will never forsake us I'll be with you even in you the end of the world the pillar of fire he's still here oh yes it is [Music] hallelujah brother Timothy was preaching in our in our church we had meetings while the word was being spoken I was translating next to him a sister in my church she came testified while the word was being spoken she saw a mighty Angel standing behind because the Lord God always backs up the word of God few days ago come on Saints a few days ago brother Timothy can witness they had meetings in New report in Belgium young people meetings brother Andrew Spencer spenc preached the word of God you know the word is a conductor so he speaks the word of God and while God is moving the angel of the Lord comes down he been visible amen so don't don't you put limits to God hallelujah oh help us Lord don't you put limits the pillar of fire didn't

not an excitement a supernatural God producing the supernatural amen amen only believe we're not going to leave anyone behind maybe you have a beloved one maybe you have a son maybe you have a daughter the time is now for the prodal to come back because there's a gathering going on what can I do what can I do only believe Hallelujah and defy Satan in Jesus name he's the same yesterday forever you know I I I had the privilege of meeting brother khen Singh a pastor in Durban South Africa we met him last night and and maybe he's listening you my friend I love what he said he says if in Hell there is a hospital during this weekend they won't have enough [Laughter] beds let me say it they won't have enough beds what does that every demon of hell we found them if two or three can agree upon anything I give it to you in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Jesus Christ he comes into his people to man manifest himself through the people show that he's the same the word of God tells us the works that I do shall you do also he promised these things what is it it's the characteristics of God displaying his word that's what God wants to do manifesting his word [Music] Now watch how he stated it says the prophet I don't know when I started so I don't know when I finished that's what he stated the works that I do you know what the prophet says he's doing them right now [Music] doing them right now heaing the sick raising the dead opening the eyes of the these work shall ye do also if you believe in me say the Lord now the Greater Works has to have the power in the church listen now [Music] people try to limit God you cannot put God in the box so the greater work shall you [Music] do he says not only heal the sicks by Prayer by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but impart eternal life to believers oh [Music] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost has was coming and giving into the hands of the church to impart eternal life that's what Calvary man Jesus told us I need to go I'll go and prepare a place for you but I'll send you the comforter I'll send you my spirit I'll send you my life and the works that I do shall do also greater than this why not greater because the same works the greater because now it's through a many membered bride oh the spirit is moving hallelujah hallelujah amen amen now he says not another work but God wants to bring the Holy Ghost in you to continue the same work that he was doing in Christ listen that's why you need it's not a maybe you need to receive the baptism and what does the word says full obedience to the word of God entitles you to the Token it's a promise be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before of course you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so now he says the work the work what work the Greater Works the work of God wasn't so needy in the days of Luther in the days of Wesley because the Bible says it would get weaker and wiser and more wicked isn't that what we see also in Uganda the world getting more and more wicked now I'm quoting you the prophet we can talk about how bad the world is becoming but let's not forget how more powerful the Bride of Jesus Christ is

ready fly up give me a few seconds anyway let's goote he says now the breath and the spirit has become the same she's uniting together bringing forth that same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like he did back there man in the same Works being manifested right now to watch what Jesus said verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing except he sees the father doing it first what the father

the brothers to send them to me Timothy used to brother Tim used to send me a lot of those from and I I grew up feeding on these kind of things and uh who were the preachers people like our brother David pre on those youth camps who were the preachers people like our brother Timothy over here and some of you may not have had him Minister before and many other brother Ron Spen and others but I tell you what it made a man out of me and I kept on thirsting and hungering in my heart when will it be the day that men like this will visit our country our people that they will imp what God has given to them now I remember when I first when we first sent out the uh the the poster when we first sent it out there's a sister over here if you can stand I know you do not expect this sister Mari
