[5:30] but the joy light there
[5:38] Hebrews 12.
[5:42] one says weather for
[5:45] uh wherefore seeing seeing we also are
[5:50] compared
[5:52] about with so great cloud of witness
[5:57] let us lay aside every weight
[6:02] and the sin which not so easily beset us
[6:07] let us run with patience
[6:09] the race that is set before us
[6:13] looking unto Jesus the author
[6:16] and finisher of our faith who for the
[6:20] joy that was set before him endured the
[6:24] cross
[6:25] despising the shame
[6:27] and he sat down at the right hand of the
[6:31] Throne of God
[6:34] blessed Jesus Christ we thank you for
[6:37] the portion of the scripture we have
[6:38] read tonight
[6:40] Lord we pray
[6:42] we know that any man can turn the pages
[6:44] of the Bible
[6:46] but Jesus might desire that you come
[6:50] and give us the inspiration tonight
[6:52] speak to us people
[6:54] bless us Lord that by the end of the
[6:56] service Lord Jesus we go back testifying
[6:59] how you have blessed us in Jesus name we
[7:02] pray
[7:03] amen you may be seated
[7:06] obviously it's
[7:09] I want I have something that I want us
[7:11] to share tonight
[7:13] praise be to God
[7:16] ah are you expecting to receive from the
[7:18] law tonight
[7:20] amen
[7:24] the prophet tells us
[7:26] the message expectation
[7:30] uh we always receive
[7:33] what
[7:35] we expect
[7:37] blessed with the name of the Lord
[7:40] yeah it's not easy always to Stand Here
[7:43] personally it always gives me hard time
[7:46] whenever I'm told that you're going to
[7:48] stand
[7:49] there's never been easy praise be to God
[7:53] sometimes you wonder what you're going
[7:55] to speak
[7:57] and I'm trusting the Lord because he
[7:59] knows by desires of our heart
[8:03] yeah we don't stand here because we are
[8:05] Champion or we are anybody but we are
[8:07] stand here because of the grace of God
[8:10] blessed with the name of the Lord
[8:13] and always you feel nervous to stand
[8:16] here
[8:17] but I'm trusting the Lord tonight by the
[8:19] hope of the Holy Spirit
[8:21] I believe in the few minutes we are
[8:24] going to spend here he will speak to us
[8:26] amen
[8:28] God has never gathered his children in
[8:30] vain
[8:31] each time he gathers us you always have
[8:34] something for us
[8:36] praise be to God
[8:38] and uh I believe I've ever shared about
[8:42] this I don't know uh
[8:44] but tonight I want us to share about
[8:48] forecast faith
[8:51] praise be to God
[8:53] the Bible says that without faith it is
[8:55] impossible to please God
[9:00] and all the armor
[9:03] of Christians
[9:05] they are invisible
[9:07] praise be to God and the only way we can
[9:10] activate it is by faith
[9:14] because if you look at the nine
[9:16] spiritual gifts all of them they are
[9:18] invisible
[9:19] praise be to God
[9:21] amen you cannot see love but you have
[9:25] love
[9:26] you cannot see Faith but you have faith
[9:28] amen you cannot see patience but you
[9:32] have patience you cannot see long
[9:34] suffering meekness gentleness godliness
[9:36] all those things they are invisible but
[9:40] it's by faith that we put those things
[9:42] in action blessed be the name of the
[9:45] Lord
[9:45] and where we have read here in Hebrews
[9:47] chapter 12 I know the scripture has been
[9:50] read for
[9:51] centuries and thousands of years amen he
[9:56] said that we are for sins that we are
[9:59] compassed about with so great cloud of
[10:03] witness
[10:04] let us lay aside every weight amen and
[10:10] the sin which that easily so easily be
[10:14] set us
[10:17] amen
[10:19] seeing that we are surrounded wherever
[10:22] we are
[10:23] we are surrounded by great cloud of
[10:26] witness
[10:27] and always we have two kind of witnesses
[10:31] blessed with the name of the Lord those
[10:33] who made it
[10:35] and those who fail amen and they fail
[10:39] not because God failed them but it's
[10:41] because they failed themselves blessed
[10:44] in the name of the Lord so tonight I
[10:47] don't know what uh I don't know uh the
[10:49] kind of witness you are looking at
[10:51] but I want to look at the positive
[10:53] Witnesses those who married amen the
[10:57] Bible says for us to make it let us lay
[11:00] aside every weight amen he has a reason
[11:04] why he's mentioning this because we know
[11:07] the Bible tells us that what happened to
[11:09] our fathers in the wilderness it was for
[11:12] our examples lest we repeat the same
[11:15] mistake amen because when they disobeyed
[11:18] God and they mumbled against God the
[11:21] Bible says a thousand they were killed
[11:24] by serpent
[11:25] blessed be the name of the Lord
[11:28] what killed them it was unbelief praise
[11:32] the Lord
[11:32] and what's the sin sin is unbelief and
[11:35] here the Bible is telling us let us let
[11:38] aside every weight
[11:41] you know the sin is very heavy
[11:45] sin is very heavy
[11:48] but there is a possibility of laying it
[11:50] aside so it served you to decide
[11:53] whether you're going to part with sin or
[11:56] you are going to carry on with it but
[11:58] here the Bible tells us let us lay aside
[12:01] every weight and every sin that was
[12:05] easily beset us and we run
[12:09] and beset us and let us
[12:15] the reason asked why you are here
[12:17] and you're not at home the Bible says
[12:20] let us
[12:23] not let you only but let us run together
[12:26] amen
[12:28] let us run
[12:31] with Passions
[12:34] amen the race
[12:38] that is said before us
[12:42] brethren we have a race set before us
[12:45] we are not the first runners in this
[12:48] race
[12:48] amen
[12:51] they're the first Runners the second
[12:53] Runners but we count ourselves as the
[12:56] last Runners amen and we know in the
[13:00] game in athletic game we know that
[13:03] always the last the first Runners and
[13:06] the last Runners they are always the
[13:08] best Runners amen
[13:11] so we consider ourselves we count
[13:13] ourselves to be the best Runners but
[13:17] before we run in this race we are
[13:19] running
[13:20] you don't run with everything amen you
[13:24] have to part with some things to run in
[13:26] this race you must be focused Amen to
[13:31] run in this race blessed be the name of
[13:34] the Lord if we are not focused we cannot
[13:36] make it in this race but we need to fast
[13:39] be focused amen when Elijah met when
[13:43] Elisha met Elijah amen Elijah had to go
[13:48] back and kill the seven Bullocks he had
[13:51] and offered party to his people amen
[13:54] because he knew that when he carry on
[13:57] with those things there he will not be
[13:59] focused
[14:01] so he had to go back he told him because
[14:04] Elijah when he came to him he just came
[14:06] and tap on him and then he continued but
[14:09] this man went and killed the seven
[14:11] Bullock he had
[14:13] and made the farewell to his people
[14:15] blessed be the name of the Lord
[14:18] and then he came and followed the Lord
[14:21] all of us in Christian Life we have a
[14:25] center or a point of focus
[14:27] and what has kept you moving for all
[14:30] these years
[14:31] what has kept you in the world for all
[14:34] these years not because you don't have
[14:36] battles Brothers we have battles not
[14:39] because we are not tempted we are
[14:42] tempted every day every hour every
[14:45] second but why have it why have you not
[14:48] given up it is because you have a point
[14:51] of forecast you are focusing on
[14:53] something amen you are focusing on
[14:56] somebody
[14:58] blessed with the name of the Lord
[15:00] we are focusing on Jesus Jesus our point
[15:04] of focus but the Bible tells us let us
[15:07] lay aside every weight each one of us
[15:10] we know the things which just easily
[15:13] beset us
[15:15] each one of us we know our point of
[15:18] weaknesses
[15:20] you know that uh for me however strong I
[15:23] am I cannot bypass there
[15:27] blessed in the name of the Lord
[15:29] so the Bible says let us
[15:31] don't run alone amen I know when God
[15:34] called Abraham blessed with the name of
[15:37] the Lord he called him to walk alone
[15:39] with God praise the Lord
[15:42] but here the Bible says let us run
[15:45] amen we know we are called from
[15:48] different walks of life to come and
[15:50] follow Jesus and when we come as one
[15:54] bunch
[15:55] different members in one body of Christ
[15:57] the Bible says let us run Amen Let Us
[16:01] lay aside every weight and every sin Let
[16:05] Us easily beset us God has brought us
[16:09] more in store
[16:10] blessed with the name of the Lord
[16:13] each one of us will have to determine
[16:15] our heart
[16:17] I always plan say God let me not be a
[16:20] hindering block let not be a hindrance
[16:22] to the children of God
[16:25] says that when one of us misbehave
[16:28] amen we can constraint death among us
[16:32] our people
[16:35] praise the Lord but let each one of us
[16:38] determine our heart to live for Christ
[16:41] amen Let each one of us dig ourselves
[16:46] let us search our lives and remove every
[16:50] hindrance amen every stumbling block in
[16:54] our lives
[16:57] I don't want to reach there
[16:59] and God said because I I misbehaved
[17:02] that's why I hear the days of the First
[17:04] Progress blessed with the name of the
[17:07] Lord but it's my prayer I know Brethren
[17:11] I have battles each one of us we have
[17:14] battles we are fighting and we are going
[17:16] to find this battle until Jesus comes
[17:19] amen but one thing I want to assure you
[17:22] that the battle we are fighting the
[17:25] victory is on our side
[17:27] best way the Bible tells us whosoever
[17:30] comes to God Must Believe
[17:33] not May believe you must believe that he
[17:38] is
[17:40] of them who seeketh him diligently
[17:43] blessed be the name of the Lord
[17:46] and verses 3 says looking unto Jesus
[17:52] who is the author
[17:54] I love that
[17:56] Jesus is the author of your faith
[18:00] it's the one who started it amen before
[18:03] you knew it brother sister Jesus had
[18:06] already started it amen
[18:11] so we don't need to worry about tomorrow
[18:13] whether I'm going to stand for the next
[18:15] 10 years whether I'm going to stand
[18:17] tomorrow no matter what comes our way we
[18:22] shall stand because Jesus is the author
[18:25] and the spiritual of our faith amen we
[18:30] did not even know that we had bypassed
[18:33] our theophany to be born in this world
[18:35] but that God Amen the one who is the
[18:39] author of our faith he said the prophet
[18:42] in our generation who came and revealed
[18:46] us the Mysteries that you know what boys
[18:49] bypass your theophany you were in God
[18:52] before the foundation of the world
[18:54] blessed with the name of the Lord so we
[18:57] don't need to worry what we have to do
[18:59] let us focus on Jesus
[19:01] amen when he called us the rest will
[19:06] leave it for him
[19:07] to begin with none of us told him to
[19:10] call did you tell Jesus that you called
[19:12] me
[19:13] no sir
[19:15] like we had uh in a convention West
[19:18] where the minister say that one came to
[19:21] Jesus running master good master I want
[19:24] to follow you Jesus told him his
[19:26] half holes and birds have their nest
[19:29] but a son of man has even no place to
[19:32] lay his head
[19:33] and here he met Andrew and told him come
[19:36] and follow me and the man gave ex's do
[19:38] you know what I have to fast count but
[19:40] he said let the dead body they are dead
[19:43] so it is Jesus's business amen this
[19:46] business we are in it is God's business
[19:50] you must be only willing to work with
[19:53] God
[19:54] amen but the rest belongs to him
[19:58] I don't know how I will maneuver
[19:59] tomorrow God he knows blessed be the
[20:02] name of the Lord we don't live for our
[20:04] own but we live for God
[20:06] praise the Lord so he said let us lay
[20:09] aside every weight Amen Let us look unto
[20:15] Jesus do not look at your pastor do not
[20:18] look at your brother did I look at your
[20:20] husband but let us look unto Jesus amen
[20:24] he is the author blessed with the name
[20:27] of the Lord
[20:29] Jesus is the finisher Jesus is the
[20:31] author of our faith praise the Lord
[20:35] amen
[20:38] who for the joy
[20:41] that was set before him
[20:43] and you are the cross
[20:46] many times we sing to be like Jesus to
[20:50] be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like
[20:53] him
[20:54] but when time come for that part of
[20:57] trial we don't want to take the Peter
[20:59] cup
[21:00] praise the Lord
[21:02] we all know what blessings alone
[21:06] but brother sometime this package it has
[21:09] a bitter side also
[21:12] when they were eating the lamb
[21:14] they had to mix it with bitter herbs
[21:18] yes sir
[21:20] amen
[21:22] it was a bitter harp I don't know
[21:29] I will not eat the pizza house
[21:34] you have to mix it with a bitter herb
[21:37] praise the Lord
[21:39] so Jesus
[21:41] when he looked at the glory set before
[21:43] him amen
[21:46] he said that uh set before him and he
[21:49] was the cross
[21:51] despising the shame
[21:53] when we will focus on Jesus looking at
[21:57] the glory I sent before us amen we are
[22:00] going to endure the trouble we are going
[22:02] into we are going to endure our trials
[22:06] praise the Lord because we know that
[22:09] even sickness cannot destroy us and if
[22:12] it destroys us it is added an advantage
[22:15] because there is a glory set before us
[22:19] amen that's where our focus is
[22:23] praise the Lord we should not settle for
[22:26] less
[22:27] we should only set up for
[22:30] God healing us from flu or call for
[22:33] fever brother sister that is still more
[22:36] in store amen let us keep focusing and
[22:39] moving forward in Christ
[22:41] blessed with the name of the Lord how to
[22:45] reach point where the blessings of God
[22:46] will burst in our midst amen we are the
[22:50] gift of the Holy Ghost will sweep in our
[22:52] meetings praise the Lord
[22:55] amen only what we need is to focus in
[22:59] the world let us focus in Christ let us
[23:02] blessed every weight praise be to God
[23:08] sometimes we look at where we have
[23:10] failed God
[23:12] you see about God I even wonder whether
[23:14] I'm the bride
[23:17] that is the devil lying you
[23:20] praise be to God
[23:22] as long as you're in that body that body
[23:26] has never been saved
[23:28] yes sir
[23:32] and we know the battle is in the mind
[23:35] that is the battlefield
[23:38] so you must put that mind into
[23:41] subjection amen
[23:44] let the devil not deceive you because
[23:46] it's not that there was to work to tell
[23:48] you whether you're a child of God or not
[23:51] praise be to God because the devil knows
[23:54] his end he cannot be forgiven he knows
[23:57] where he came from
[23:59] praise the Lord but let us focus on
[24:02] Jesus
[24:03] let us listen every weight and every sin
[24:07] in First Peter chapter 5.
[24:10] verses 7 it says cast all your cares
[24:12] upon Him
[24:14] for he cares for you
[24:16] let us cast our cares upon the Lord let
[24:20] us cast our worries upon the Lord let us
[24:23] let us cast our insufficiency upon the
[24:26] Lord our God is sufficient it's Jehovah
[24:30] amen is our healer is our provider what
[24:35] we have to do let us look unto Jesus and
[24:39] cast our worries upon him
[24:41] praise the Lord
[24:43] it will help us carry our abundance
[24:46] blessed be the name of the Lord
[24:49] amen when Jesus looks at the glory said
[24:52] before you remember the prophet says
[24:55] that when Jesus was in The Garden of
[24:56] Gethsemane he had about to within
[24:59] himself praise the Lord
[25:03] things were tough
[25:06] he prayed he was praying against the
[25:08] will of God
[25:10] he was looking at all the pain that
[25:13] touch and the agony was going to go
[25:15] through
[25:16] I said father if it is possible
[25:19] if but he knew that it was impossible
[25:22] I say finally Lord
[25:24] let your will be done
[25:27] praise be to God
[25:29] and the Bible tells us that by faith
[25:31] when Moses
[25:34] when Moses gets old
[25:36] he refused to be called inside of
[25:38] Pharaoh's daughter he shows rather to
[25:40] suffer with a chain of Israel the
[25:42] reproach of Christ amen Moses was
[25:45] forecast
[25:46] he knew that all this glory in Egypt is
[25:50] just for a meantime
[25:52] but there is eternal blessing amen
[25:55] so he show us to suffer with the
[25:57] children of Israel will the church need
[26:00] tonight not another message not another
[26:04] preacher not a mighty preacher but the
[26:07] church need to focus amen because God
[26:10] has given us everything in our
[26:12] generation
[26:13] blessed be the name of the Lord
[26:16] amen
[26:21] in the message the marriage of the Lamb
[26:24] the prophet say that you see God could
[26:26] not push us through a little pipe and
[26:29] pull us out of the other end
[26:33] and then saying blessed is the overcomer
[26:36] praise be to God
[26:38] we must overcome something
[26:41] because there is a reward for Overcomers
[26:43] not for quitters Amen brother you must
[26:48] overcome that habit in your life
[26:50] you must overcome your fears
[26:53] sometimes you want to plan fast but you
[26:56] see but also's brother
[26:58] you must overcome
[27:01] amen he says God cannot push us push us
[27:05] under like in the pipe and then it goes
[27:07] the other side
[27:13] the part of olden days it used to be
[27:16] that man could men used to go for
[27:19] battles
[27:20] and they fight and come back with the
[27:24] victory
[27:25] and to attain
[27:28] rank in the Army you had to work for it
[27:33] blessed be the name of the Lord
[27:35] you have to fight a full battalion
[27:39] and destroy all of them

[28:26] Lord so we must focus on the Lord praise
[28:30] the Lord many time we are looking at the
[28:33] contrary wind
[28:36] if you read the book of Matthew where
[28:38] the Bible says that when Jesus
[28:42] Jesus was in the boat
[28:45] and he was asleep
[28:47] and then there was a wind
[28:50] praise be to God this will be forgot
[28:53] that they had Jesus in the boat amen

[28:59] come to church to be awakened and be
[29:02] reminded of our promises in the world
[29:05] praise me to God
[29:07] this man for God that Jesus was there
[29:10] and then demon Rose
[29:13] and then she wrote and they started
[29:16] crying Master we are perishing praise be
[29:18] to God Amen but if they had focused on
[29:22] Jesus and not looking at the contrary
[29:24] wind they would move forward praise the
[29:28] Lord but we thank God that even when we
[29:30] are throwing down praise be to God he
[29:33] still lend us a Hopping hand
[29:35] praise be to God
[29:37] amen he says that blessed is the blessed
[29:41] is he that overcometh

[29:46] pushed you through but you have called
[29:48] to make a decision for yourself

[31:22] and nobody did not even know that maybe

[36:02] James chapter 1 verses 60 says that for
[36:05] he that waveth is like a wave of the sea
[36:11] driven with the Wind
[36:14] and toasted
[36:18] faith is an anchor
[36:22] and Baba says that faith
[36:25] When Faith speaks
[36:28] everything shuts up
[36:31] amen
[36:33] faith is like the king of the jungle

[37:02] and if we are to make it in this
[37:04] personal what has kept me till this year

[37:26] six packs in our uh maybe stomach around
[37:29] our chest no sir
[37:33] but we have Jesus amen Jesus is our
[37:37] master
[37:38] the prophecy that Samson was just an
[37:41] ordinary man maybe it was like tiny as
[37:44] Tiny as me
[37:46] but what made that difference was the
[37:49] spirit of God upon him
[37:52] amen where that Holy Ghost came upon him
[37:56] oh yes
[37:59] Samson became problem to the philistine
[38:04] praise be to God
[38:10] that is the thing that broke the
[38:12] fellowship in Eden because he failed to
[38:16] keep focused of looking on God's word in
[38:20] the message Victory Day 630 421
[38:24] you see
[38:26] and this happens even in our daily life
[38:30] when you're at school and you lose focus
[38:34] if they have taken you there to study
[38:36] then remove your focus from books you
[38:39] focus on boys you focus on girls you
[38:42] know what happened
[38:44] and here he says that what broke
[38:46] Fellowship in Eden it was because Eve
[38:49] lost Focus amen
[38:52] you were supposed to focus on the the
[38:54] word of God
[38:56] but she lost that Focus amen and that's
[38:59] how serpent managed
[39:01] focusing on
[39:03] uh of her looking on God's word she
[39:06] listened to reasoning of the enemy
[39:10] if she had just stayed right
[39:14] with God
[39:16] God said so that set us it God said so
[39:20] but she did not want to do that she
[39:24] changed the focus of her glasses
[39:27] amen that's why the Bible told us where
[39:31] I read in Hebrews chapter 12. let us
[39:34] look unto Jesus amen let our Focus be on
[39:38] Jesus 24 7.
[39:42] no matter what is the surrounding but
[39:45] let us focus in the Lord amen
[39:48] when he was sick Focus unto Jesus
[39:52] when you are depressed look unto Jesus
[39:54] amen he is the center of our focus is
[39:59] the game changer the it's the one who
[40:02] solves our problems amen
[40:08] in the message discernment of the spirit
[40:10] the prophet says that
[40:15] the Sun that spirit
[40:18] see whether it is of god
[40:21] see whether it acts like him and if
[40:24] somebody kicks up something against you
[40:27] and throw that upon your life
[40:29] when you know you are as innocent as you
[40:32] can be and you know
[40:35] that you have got the spirit of God
[40:37] don't try to separate yourself
[40:40] don't try to act mean toward them don't
[40:45] cast them just walk on knowing that God
[40:48] did not do that God did that to give you
[40:52] a test to see how you would take it
[40:56] praise the Lord
[40:58] we must focus our lives
[41:03] not what somebody else says but focus
[41:06] our lives
[41:09] to Christ and to his word
[41:14] when you're focused
[41:17] I'm telling you
[41:19] nobody can move you
[41:22] the reason that's why people are drifted
[41:24] they are trusted the two and the floor
[41:27] they are moving from pillar to parts
[41:29] from church to church it is because they
[41:32] are not forecast amen
[41:36] but when you're focus in the Lord
[41:38] Jesus means more than life to you
[41:44] you cannot leave the message church and
[41:46] you go to Catholicism
[41:48] is because
[41:50] I wonder the kind of glass you're
[41:51] wearing
[41:53] either you're wearing sunglasses in the
[41:55] night
[41:57] blessed with the name of the Lord but
[41:59] when you're focused
[42:01] no matter what happens around you
[42:05] sometimes things seems like they are not
[42:07] working out amen and they never make you
[42:10] think that maybe the message you believe
[42:12] is the problem one brother one time say
[42:15] that before I believe the message I was
[42:16] very okay but when I believe the message
[42:19] things stand by suck
[42:23] and so
[42:26] that was an alarm that he was leaving
[42:28] the message
[42:30] blessed with the name of the Lord
[42:34] and when we believe the message it
[42:35] doesn't mean that you're not going to
[42:36] make problems
[42:40] amen but when we are growing there are
[42:43] many things the challenges the things we
[42:45] meet along the way
[42:46] even when a tree is growing you'll find
[42:49] a tall Fuller tree
[42:51] they will tell that three is 50 years or
[42:54] 100 years old
[42:57] and everybody admires it
[43:03] but do you know what that tree went
[43:06] through
[43:08] so there are many things we encounter
[43:11] during our growth
[43:13] but that three no matter what happens as
[43:17] long as the sun is there amen it knows
[43:21] that it will continue growing as long as
[43:24] the Son of God is in our midst as long
[43:27] as Jesus Christ is moving in our midst
[43:30] no matter what happened to us brother
[43:33] sister we are moving on
[43:35] amen the program the progress man looks
[43:39] over seems to be little but friends
[43:42] something is happening within us
[43:45] blessed with the name of the Lord your
[43:48] brother may not see it your husband may
[43:51] not see it your wife may not see it but
[43:54] the devil knows it amen
[43:57] blessed with the name of the Lord
[44:00] sometimes you don't you may not need me
[44:02] to see it bless him with the name of the
[44:04] Lord but our Heir and our only person
[44:07] knows it
[44:10] praise the Lord what we need is to focus
[44:15] to have that focused faith faith comes
[44:18] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[44:20] God
[44:22] amen we cannot grow in faith when we
[44:25] don't hear the word when we don't read
[44:27] the word when we don't attend Fellowship
[44:30] when we don't pray and fast
[44:34] blessed with the name of the Lord
[44:39] but when we Implement all these things
[44:42] we are going to get focused
[44:45] amen
[44:47] when we know who we are
[44:50] there we are going to be focused
[44:53] we know that we are not of this world
[44:56] we are just passed away
[45:03] praise the Lord
[45:06] he said let us lay aside
[45:09] rather be a cloud of witnesses who made
[45:11] it
[45:12] job is one of them he was tried
[45:15] he went through hard time
[45:19] we were telling his wounds
[45:22] but he never gave up amen
[45:25] because job was focused
[45:28] and through whatever he went through he
[45:31] happened was the first man to see
[45:33] Resurrection was job blessed with the
[45:36] name of the Lord
[45:37] when God wanted a job to see
[45:39] Resurrection
[45:41] chips and chicken
[45:44] he met him he made him go through hard
[45:47] time
[45:48] he allowed the devil to try him
[45:51] but God knew that this man was focused
[45:54] in him
[45:55] his anger was in the Lord and God was so
[45:59] sure amen every time God drops dry on
[46:03] your way God is very sure and very
[46:06] certain that you are going to overcome
[46:09] that trial
[46:10] blessed with the name of the Lord
[46:12] by some time we look at it and come from
[46:16] our perception and see the magnitude of
[46:19] the trial but my brother my sister God
[46:22] knows very well what is doing
[46:26] amen
[46:28] Samuel says that what kind of man when
[46:31] you're going to build a house
[46:33] you don't first sit and do the
[46:35] calculation unless you build amen do you
[46:39] know that we are House of God we are
[46:41] God's Powerhouse amen he said you first
[46:45] to sit and make the calculation lest you
[46:48] peel and you fail on the when men
[46:50] laughed at you
[46:52] but God who called us
[46:57] God cannot just lose us like that
[47:00] the add-on cannot happen
[47:02] and the devil knows that
[47:04] amen
[47:06] the devil is very sure that God cannot
[47:09] lose us and the devil knows that whether
[47:12] he like it or not we are going to make
[47:15] it
[47:16] we are moving forward we are not moving
[47:18] backward every sermon comes our way it
[47:22] makes us better Christian than when we
[47:25] came in
[47:26] amen so let us just focus Let each one
[47:30] of us Focus amen
[47:33] you get a scripture and cling to it say
[47:37] God I must see this happening in my life
[47:41] the Bible tells us that we should desire
[47:44] spiritual gift
[47:46] praise the Lord
[47:48] say God I want to see love in my heart
[47:51] give me love amen give me peace in my
[47:55] heart blessed with the name of the Lord

[48:08] the Lord my soul be of good courage
[48:12] praise the Lord those are men who were
[48:16] focused
[48:17] the Bible said they moved once they put
[48:20] on sheep's kins they moved in deserts
[48:23] they were not satisfied why because
[48:27] these men were forecast amen let us not
[48:30] be like Lord when he entered Sodom he
[48:34] rested
[48:36] but Abraham who was focused he said no
[48:39] no no no no praise be to God there is
[48:42] something much better than this praise
[48:44] the Lord in the message Luke he says
[48:47] that we must focus our lives not what
[48:50] somebody else says but we must focus our
[48:52] lives
[48:53] to Christ and he is the one and if we
[48:57] get our lives line with the word then
[49:00] the word and our life becomes the same

[49:27] bitterness lay aside every jokes praise
