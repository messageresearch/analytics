said now we have in pasta medicine he is going to come up front here and introduce our Minister for today so Pastor foreign [Applause] a lot of stuff that I do have I got it from him because he influenced me a lot since I was even a high school boy so I had a lot of influence from him I had to spend much of my time in her with him so he's one man who also taught me to be patient with things this one man who taught me to be most of what I am so uh this one if I am giving much time to speak then it might take ages for me to finish what he did for me but above all he showed me more love than anyone May and can show so is one person who I have been with in hard times and we have been also together in Sweet Moments so given that we both know how to serve on it and we also both know how to about so at this point I will call Pastor meeting to come and introduce the minister God bless you yeah God bless you [Music] thank you God bless you [Music] thank you very much in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen are happy to be in the house of the Lord especially on a Wednesday amen normally I take home I say to those that do not come on the midweek Services they must not come on Sunday because you must not come to church where you want you must come to church because it's God's appointment so in our country there's a newspaper called the days it comes every day but there are Sunday males that come every Sunday so don't become a sentiment thank you amen so don't become the Sunday Mail and don't become like parade once in a month I mean so may God richly bless you we are so happy to be in the house of the Lord amen and I want to thank each uh brother Peter Chaka I stayed with him for over five years in my house it's been a blessing amen and we trust God he's still a tremendous blessing to you it's very good to be back in Bulawayo I want to appreciate Pastor gwenya let's appreciate him tonight [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the reason of me being in plawayo is because normally when he and me when we see something good we bring it home amen wherever we go we see something good we bring it home amen so last year I was I I went for meetings in Kampala Uganda it was a National Convention all churches were together in Kampala so I was slotted about two or three services it's all behind me there was a preacher that was always preaching behind me but I took note he was different amen and I get to know the testimony around him amen that he was raised in a Catholic home the father was a priest and he believed this message and he's still holding on to it and preaching it above all above all there was one significant thing that really touched my heart when I flew to Kampala I flew through Ethiopia I just got an interest in the country I realized that the population it has a population of 125 million people is the most after Nigeria as the most populous nation and it is the fourth largest International airliner by destination and by the number of aircrafts so I took a special interest because I had I listened so many times and preached from the Queen of Sheba she came from Ethiopia Amir so in the preacher student he I got to know that he he preached in Ethiopia he opened a church in Ethiopia Not Alone one but two churches there's never been a message Church in Ethiopia and he is the first seed is the first man that established a church and gave it over it as a pastor and the second one is also another living testimony [Applause] [Music] and is only 32. amen I don't look 50 but I'm 50. amen so that really touched me AME of how he is moving with the Gospel of Jesus Christ and I thought it best you could come down preach for us he's been to so we made another image with Pastor mahere he went to South Africa and then he came for Easter meetings I want to tell you says you are in for a gastronomical jubilee amen you're going to enjoy the ministry and you'll love it amen so allow me tonight to introduce to you uh pasta from Uganda amen so he has a church in Kampala is married five children amen and we are so happy we have been blessed throughout the week amen so I thought it best you could also share the blessing how many under great expectation amen we just want to sing the song as we as we invite the people as you invite the priest we stand on our feet all my life you have been faithful and all my life you have been School Army knows the song amen I love you Lord amen knows the song if you can have the handwriting on the wall [Music] okay I see Brother Bruce yes you can come and help us I love you Lord [Music] please loneliness [Music] [Music] I was seeing myself [Applause] foreign [Music] all my life one more times I will see a good name Hallelujah giving praise giving praise giving praise giving praise give me praise tell him Lord you've been faithful all my life I have a reason to worship you tonight oh thank you Jesus father we want to give you glory we want to give you praise because of your goodness we can now say tonight that your goodness is running after us father Lord Jesus even when we thought you would not make it even when we never saw ourselves as Believers of this precious message your goodness has been running after us ever since you called us father and Lord we can surely say Lord you love us and we love you oh God we want to live for you we want to serve you father oh God we just commit ourselves to you tonight as we are going to go into the reading and the preaching of your word may your presence just come by oh God and then you will answer our desires and you will meet each and every one tonight we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you all I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm so happy to be here this evening I'd like to uh thank uh dear precious brother revanda Dr for allowing uh welcoming us here to come and be able to meet with you share with you you know I might be on the other I might have come from the other side of the of the of the world but really we are from the same continent and not all we are not only Africans but we are also brothers and sisters you know we we share the same DNA and one of these mornings when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound I believe we shall have a grand reunion all the saints in spotless white and coming from different parts of the world will have a great grand reunion praise the name of the Lord and so we are so happy to be with you here and uh to to just come like I think Pastor said has said it all I I so I wouldn't have I would not have a lot of uh uh introductions he has already told you much about us and uh so he has saved me the trouble to go through a lot of introductions this evening but maybe what I would say that I've been in Zimbabwe before and uh I hope you don't mind standing for just a few moments so that you just sit after we have read the word and so I've been in Zimbabwe before that is in 2011 and I was I think 19 20 years then and ministered I think for pastor Chessa and a few other other places so uh when he invited us to come again I said Zimbabwe was a great time for me then I went through a lot of trainings I went to Guru in the rural areas there and and so uh and I went through a lot and you know the Lord just training Us in the ministry and so Zimbabwe has special place in our hearts and so I received greetings from our church in Kampala days of the voice Fellowship my wife Rebecca and the family they all sent their greetings to you so I've already been around not only in Guero we've been in several places in in the country and so God has given us Grace to be able to speak to the church in Monterrey and a few in arale and so this evening the Lord has fallen on us to be here tonight I hope you've come expectant and believing that the Lord will be able to meet your need he knows what we need and he knows how to you know just come and speak to us and so without wasting a lot more time we'll just go in the word right now if you can open with me in the book of job chapter 19. we will read just two verses out of that chapter 19 verse 25 226 oh for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God Amen Let us just speak to the Lord for just a moment once again father we have read just a portion of your holy word I know that all these people that are here tonight believe this to be the truth and Lord you you met job one time and he was able at the end of it all to say by Revelation I know my redeemer liveth and and one time I'm going to see him in my flesh father may we be able by the end of this service also to be able to say the same thing like job did just come and speak to us Lord we yield ourselves to you I yield myself to you father that you will direct my thoughts and also the people that we will all hear from you tonight father we ask these blessings in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen he may be seated so I have been made to understand that there are more online than there is here uh this evening and so I want to greet also those who are online and I know some from home also could be following the service and so we are connected and you know it's not you know internet tells me of how the bride is going to be connected in that great Resurrection somehow imagine that you know Saints from all over just being able to congregate and meet together and meet the Lord in the air and so before we get into the word I want to say that I love the message with all my heart and like the Pastor said I've been I was um in the Anglican Church who was born there was raised raised there at one point I thought I was going to be a clutch there myself uh being a son of a clergy and you know being raised by a bishop in the Anglican Church I lived with him for two years started ministering actually when I was 13 years one time seated around the dining table he asked me whether uh you know I would preach he said he just you know he's a big fat man so he looked at me and and with those serious eyes and he said tell him what can you preach and so when he said that you know I feared because I did not expect him to ask me that of course I know in the Anglican Church to be able to preach you have to have gone through Theology and you know you you maybe you're a reverend or uh something at least and then you you can wear those big things that they wear the dresses and so uh when he asked me can you preach it it took me an awareness I didn't expect that you would say that and so I didn't know what to answer him and I didn't want I didn't I don't want to say no to him so I end up saying by the grace of God I believe I can and then later I regretted why I had to say that because the whole night I didn't sleep the whole night I was praying and waiting upon God to see how he will lead me what I will speak on and then he gave me Galatians 3 so I I I quote that scripture by inspiration and spoke it um uh at the church where we went to about 300 people I was only 13 years and so you can imagine you know I was very very nervous and so uh but by the grace of God about a hundred people wanted to give their lives to Jesus of course being in the aggregate Church the bishop just came and you know uh prayed a blessing I pray of blessing over them and he said now you are saved you can go back to your seats and so uh but that would then continue on like every service for uh for two years um whenever we the bishop traveled he would take take me along uh take me along and and then so time came when he actually now gave me a title he said you're a decision young evangelist and so whenever the president would come over or uh or the or one of the kings in the country you know we have very many kings in Uganda all all uh the uh you know one of the politicians or the Archbishop then you would introduce me as the devastation young evangelist and so I was used to traveling with him in his motorcade and you know being in that kind of high high I think I would want to call it hyper life and you know being in in good uh traveling in good cars and meeting good people meeting you know powerful things and so I had thought that that was the life I wanted to live because then of course you get to serve God and be closer to God and I thought being a bishop was really being closer to God but I did not know better until when I became 15 the message came my way Hallelujah and Friends when the message came my way I did not easily did not go you know well with me like like easily with me because I was I thought I was founded in what I believed to be the truth at the time and so uh long uh the story is long but uh I'll just tell you this mom this just short uh snippet of it my mother if things happen and I had to temporarily leave The Bishop's house but in that town because I was already enrolled in school there there was no um any members of our family and so I needed to stay in school and I needed to live somewhere so the only person who could think of was a family friend that lived in that in that place and uh uh guess what this family friend was actually a pastor in the message and so uh God had already envisioned all this before the foundation of the world and and so uh none of our church people wanted to live with me because they had girls in their homes and the rule is if you have if you're keeping girls you don't keep boys and so they said sorry we can't keep your son sorry we can't keep your sons but when we arrived at this man's house he had us you know just at the living room and the bedroom two rooms and and he was married and he was also keeping girls and so but when we arrived there he was a little bit hesitant but then when my mother said he's called pastor at at school you know for two years I'd been preaching and and so I always liked sharing the the word just the best scriptures with my friends and so when he had that he's called pastor at school oh he picked interest he said I think I'll keep him and so that's how I started staying with a message believer and so for about six months they began to share with me the message and uh you know uh to tell me about the godhead one God About the Name of Jesus of the Lord Jesus Christ in water baptism and tell me that of all the things that you now believe that we now all believe and I was not so fast in believing it because my mother before she left this place she had showed me a picture that was in this man's house of brother Barnum with that pill of fire and told me that this these people are a couch and this is the man they believe in and so it had kind of made me nervous and and brought a lot of fear on me and I kind of feared really uh go ahead and and dig deeper well I was saying that whatever they were saying was in the word but I I was fearing thinking that these people have more than what they are actually saying and whatever they have that is more that they are concealing somewhere is a bit cultish that's what I kind of felt and so after they had shared everything with me one time I asked them I said but who is that man because I waited for them to Bow and prostrate before this man and they did not and so one time I asked I said who is this man and so the pastor was very excited when I asked that question he said all right that's a good question and so he he sat down and he said now you can sit down let us talk about it so for about an hour or so took me through Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7 and all the other scriptures in Matthew and so I I really clearly saw that there was one thing that I cleared so at that moment was that indeed there was an Elijah That was supposed to come I clearly saw that in the scriptures but now the question that was not answered that moment was that he was this man so the question was how true am I he is this man and friends they tried to convince me of course tell me about all the vindications but uh well it was a bit convincing but it took it had to take God to move my heart and so uh in the morning very early in the morning every Sunday I would go to my church and then in the afternoon I would come to to their Fellowship and so this early morning one day after like this was after a six months of knowing everything and fellowshipping with them and living with them I went to our church our Anglican church and that day was the day that the Lord had prepared for him to move on my heart because that morning you know there are thick many things that happened on this on the same day at the same time in the church it was a woman preacher on the pulpit my heart was already told me telling me that is wrong of course they had already told me and so then after that they told us to look uh to the I think to the east I don't remember and they say that you would now have to recite the Apostles Creed how many another Apostles Creed where of course God has delivered us from the Creeds of man and so and so we have to recite the Apostles Creed so these men always told me that I was Catholic and I said no I'm not Catholic I'm Anglican I'm Protestant because Anglican Church of England it means we protested against the Catholic church and so they said but no you are still Catholic you just don't know it and so that that that that morning as we were reciting the Apostles Creed there was this phrase and I believe in the Holy Catholic Church I nearly fainted because these words I had never had them all my life in the Anglican Church I was now at that time close to 15 years and so uh it was so surprising to me and you know things began to happen at that moment I almost passed out and so I began to hear this wall of wind woo and as and as it was passing by I thought everybody was hearing it so I looked around it looked like everybody was focusing on what was going on and in that moment they taught us to look to the rear of the rare side of the church and they were going to conduct a baptism you know how they conducted baptism they called The Godfather and The Godfather repents or speaks or confesses on behalf of the child and then they begin to baptize the child with that holy water from the bowel in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit so as The Godfather was answering for the baby and as they were now picking the water I I I from that world of wind that was going around my my head I had a voice friends that voice was very clear and it spoke to me and said call me by my name say Italian you were in the wrong place find the nearest exit and leave this place and as I had that I you know I began shaking and I I I I I had it second time and and then the third time I couldn't resist it I wanted to resist it but friends I couldn't resist it and so I picked my Bible and and I just swung you know just swung myself out of out of that church in the nearest exit and so of course I had nowhere to go these people were now in their church and so their Church of course is a message believer's church so I found myself there I had to go there of course I did not I had not made up my mind to join them but I had made up my mind to leave that church because of that experience which was very confusing to me of course at the time and so when I arrived there and then you know this man was preaching and hammering the gospel that's why friends were never a preacher is really preaching and hammering the gospel let us say Amen Let Us receive it because you never know someone is receiving their Deliverance while they are seated right there and by your saying amen you know God is moving on someone's life and so I just came and sat somewhere there and you know I was just like not there but there and but then when I found this man hammering the gospel you know jumping up and down as he as if to say chords of fire were under his feet I was I say to myself really this man seem as if they have something and so you was hammering everything I had left in our church he was talking his subject was that woman Jezebel and so he was speaking on the Catholic Church system and every wrong doctrine that they had propagated and you know that it's gone all over the world that a woman seated over the the many Waters and so as he went through all that you see God began to uh convict me in my soul about these all things that it was the truth of course they called the people who had accepted to believe they had known me for six months so they had given up on me because they know uh maybe you know there's some people who are like a hard not to crack You Preach to them you preach to them they keep coming to church but they're not making up their mind and so I was one of those and and so they had just given up on me but that day it was different as they called people who were ready to give their lives to Jesus I I wanted to go but you know something was just pulling me you know reminding me of all the prestigious leaving behind in our Anglican Church I was no longer going to go to Maryland address the bishop had promised me to go to Maryland to study theology so I was going to miss that part you know the devil was showing me a lot of things that you know these people have nothing where you are coming from you know you were living uh you know life at its maximum what are you going to get here you know these people were about like maybe 10 or 15 of them and and and so on most of them were living lives that seemed as as if to say miserable and you know I kind of felt uh these things it doesn't have my future here I don't have my future here but you see that's what it took for God to visit me it doesn't matter the place where God visits you when it is your day it is your day and so that was my day and and as I I was you know convincing myself not to go at that very moment you know that same condition came back again and I began to hear it when I was like oh not again by the way this that was the other one was the first and this was the only second time that thing ever came to me it never came back again but you see when it came that moment that from that war of uh in my ears The Voice came back again and and called me by name say talimar stand up throw both your hands up and declare on top of your voice that this is the truth that this message is the truth and tell them you would like to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that voice was very clear as clear as I am to you tonight and so I aesthetically you know stood up I think everybody was wondering what is happening because I just stood up and as if I was on remote control I just stood up and then just said both my hands but I only raised one out of fear and then and then I began to speak with a shaking voice and try to shout but I couldn't but I just tried my best and then I told them what the voice had said that I would I should tell them and you know what happened everybody began clapping their hands and shouting and rejoicing I was like is it a big deal to them but you see there's a big deal to the children of God when one saw hallelujah what one Soul has found Christ that was my day that I found Christ and I was baptized that same evening uh in in in in in Lake wamala in Uganda in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and that was the beginning of my uh of my journey in this precious message when I came out of the water I made it a point I said to myself that I'm going to spend my life um I I I I never said it out loud but I spoke it in my heart I said Lord I'm going to spend my life I'm going to give it to you for the purpose of propagating this message I'll tell them wherever I go that God has sent this message and this message is true and that's what we have done ever since and God has been faithful God has been faithful I tell you what God has been faithful and if if you are here tonight and you have any doubt about this message I want to tell you that this message is true this message is true so if there is anything else I would say I think that is all I will say in whatever I will say tonight that the message is true amen God has already Vindicated it nobody needs to vindicate this message the message is Vindicated the message is true God Amen prophet and this message has changed lives I want to say the greatest Vindication of this message is not even the pit of fire it's not even the the cloud the greatest Vindication of this message is you hey man it is me it is a people that God has called out of the systems and the denominations of the world and he has set them amen under the quietness of the spirit under the word and you know we are bringing out little by little the nature and character of Jesus Christ and one of these days when the trumpet shall sound we are going Amen to go in the Rapture because we are being changed right now by this message of the hour and so on our honeymoon we went to Ethiopia and you heard what the Lord did there and so then we moved back to Uganda where we are currently passing in Kampala so I think that is all that you would want to know about us now can we go in the world praise the name of the Lord and so uh that's why tonight I want to share with you on a little subject I believe this message I'm here in this message and I want you to bury me here so I want to speak to you on a subject me here and so the prophet would go ahead to say that job is the oldest book in the Bible even before Genesis job and so the Patriots knew that job had an idea on where the Redeemer would stand you see us I'll read for you a little bit later and so job but the bottom said job said bury me here when he had the revelation of where the Redeemer would stand and all of them all of the Patriarchs all of them were buried at the same place in the promised land and so we will Begin by taking this from Genesis if you can turn to Genesis 23 with me I don't think that I will be wrong I'll try to keep the time so I want you to just give me your kind and divided attention Genesis chapter 23 verse 3 says that Abraham stood up from before he's dead and spake unto the sons of Health saying I am a stranger and a sojana with you give me a position of a budding place with you that I may bury my dead out of my sight and the children of Health answered Abraham saying unto him he asked my Lord thou art a mighty Prince Among Us in the choice of our separagus bury thy dead none of us shall with withhold from thee is but that thou mayest body thy dead now they wanted to give it to him for free and Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of health and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entry for me to Ephron the son of Zohar that he may give me the cave of macpella which he has which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth He Shall give it to me for a position for a budding place amongst you now Abraham did not want to get this boring place for free he wanted to pay his money for it and Ephron dwelt among the children of health and the Ephron the heated answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Health even of all of them that went in the gate of his City and saying name my Lord hear me the field give ID and the cave that is therea in I gave it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give it to them body thy dead you are trying to negotiate with Abraham but Abraham refused with negotiate and so Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land and he speak unto him from the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou will give it I pray thee hear me I will give thee money for the field take it of me and I and I will bear him thy dead rather my dead there and ifron answered Abraham saying unto him my Lord heck and unto me the land is worth 400 shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and it's just very little money better for like that they did and Abraham heck and unto Ephron and Abraham wait to hear from the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Health 400 shekels of the silver current money with the merchant imagine if someone tells you that I'm selling this land to you for 400 uh uh uh dollars and you don't even negotiate you see Abraham had a reason why he didn't do that this was a type and we will see it you see he did not negotiate whatever they asked he they wanted to give it to him for free he said no I'll not take it for free he said no this is nothing it's just worth 400. it's just nothing we can give it to you for free he said well I will buy it and he counted everything they said it was worth and he gave it to them without negotiating and and and and he paid off the land for a barring place for himself and for his uh for his date all right let us finish up on verse 20. all right listen on it says unto Abraham okay verse 17 and the field of Ephron which was in macapella which was before memory the field and the cave which was there in and all the trees that were in the field that were in the all the borders round about were made sure and to Abraham for a position in the presence of the children of Health before all that went in at the Gate of his City and after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of macapella before mammary the same is Hebron in the canon in the land of Canaan and the field and the cave that is there in were made sure and to Abraham for opposition of a burning place by the sons of Health did you know that brother Barnum actually emphasizes in several messages and I was just reading one of them in the glorified Jesus 1955. excuse me he actually said that a job that Abraham Buried buried his dead or both this land from where actually job was buried you see um maybe and you will excuse me for reading a lot but I know you love the message on the world do you praise the name of the Lord and so let me just uh I would I will not read the whole quote I just read a little bit of it it says from paragraph for the success knowledge he made preparation for that too now let's between the let's read between the lines just a little he says job watch how he specified where his budding place was Along Came many other of the prophets we will take care we will take for instance Abraham Sarah the sweethearts of the Bible and when Abraham come along loving Sarah when she died just didn't bury her anywhere he had a spiritual revelation of something the same thing job had so he goes over near the grave where a job was buried and purchased a piece of ground right in Palestine and buried Sarah there now if you want to read directly you want to say where is that in the Bible you might not see that's why we believe that brother is the messenger of Our Generation because there are very many things that the prophet will say that are a nominal Christian will never find anywhere you see that the prophet says that the Enoch built the Pyramid it is nowhere in the Bible you will not find it you will not find who built the Pyramid you will not find why it was built this the way it was built and many things that let me tell you there are many things that you cannot find out there but you will for sure find in the message of the hour Hallelujah and so then he says that Abraham refuses to take uh that that uh that job was buried then so Abraham takes a place and buys the the piece of land from the exact place or around the same area in Palestine where job also was buried and so Abraham refuses to take a borrowing place for free he also does not negotiate as I told you he paid exactly what he was asked to pay he pays all listen this will be significant in a few moments before I close he pays all the land's worth whatever was required of him to pay he said I will pay I am not going to take it for free I am going to pay because this is so important to me I want it to be a bearing place for my people so I'm going to take it for all its worth and so of course you know from Genesis 35 27 and it says and Jacob uh came unto uh Isaac his father and to mammary and to the city of ABBA which is in Hebron where Abraham and Isaac so John and the days of Isaac were 144 school years and Isaac gave up The Ghost and died and was gathered unto his people being old and full of days so you see Isaac was also battered in the same place in Palestine right and then when you go back to to Jacob you see he was looking at the scripture here in Genesis 4 7 28 I know most of you could know this but for just the sake of giving a foundation of what I want to talk about let's just rehearse them a little bit in Genesis for the 729 he says and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years so the whole age of Jacob was 140 and seven years and the time Drew now that Israel must die this is Jacob and he carried his son Joseph sorry he called his son Joseph and said unto him if now I have found Grace in thy sight put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me remember now they were now in the land of Egypt they had left the land of promise so he said pay with my fathers and you will carry me out of Egypt and you will bury me in their boring place so you see this was a significant place Hallelujah all the Patriots were abandoned in that same place and we notice here when the time came now also for Joseph Joseph did not get a chance to live you know alive and so we're noticed here in Genesis 50 24 he says and Joseph said unto his Brethren I die and God will surely visit you I love the way you say these words Hallelujah he wasn't that God might visit you oh God maybe we'll visit you but God will surely visit you Hallelujah these people had a promise these people they knew they had to be in their land of promise and they knew that there was coming that time when God would visit them and so he said look I die but God will surely visit you and he will bring you out of this land unto the land which he swear to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and Joseph two can also the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and he shall carry me shall shall carry up my bones from hands Hallelujah this man is speaking like job he knew maybe by the time God visits you my body might just be born Hallelujah but I know God will visit you it doesn't matter how long it takes but when God speaks his word his word must come to pass Hallelujah they had a promise and they promised had to come to pass oh my we have a promise and that promise must come to pass God must surely visit us and and so you see he said you'll carry up my bones hands so Joseph died so Joseph died but he had told them you must carry my bones out of here it doesn't matter how long I'm I'm long dead but you must carry me and so they involved him and they put him in in the coffin in Egypt and they waited for the time God will visit them excuse me and so Joseph died in the faith he knew that God would visit the children of Israel and he knew that God would carry them out of Egypt into the promised land praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I tell you what I'm looking for that time when God will visit this generation Hallelujah God has sent us a message and this message must fulfill its purpose that it has meant oh it was meant into our lives this message did not come to educate us to give us better knowledge about life and to give us better knowledge about things the purpose of the oh Hallelujah glory to God the purpose of this message is to bring forth about the change this is the only purpose of the message but there are many other things that are going to happen while we are living here the blessings of the message they will be there but the purpose of this message is the rapture that's why we have songs like I'm thinking of the Rapture I'm thinking of the Rapture the believer wherever you are you must be prepared for the coming of the Lord this message has come to call us out of the systems of man and prepare us amen for for the Rapture how does it prepare us It prepares us by uh by daily you know changing US changing us the word of God changes you changes me and brings us into the nature into the character into the image of Jesus Christ and so see Moses Moses as brother would say then in the message Israel and the church but the bottom would go on to say he says mother started out now of course as they were going out of the uh out of um out of Egypt he says mother started out the Holy Spirit spoke to him and said oh Moses you are forgetting something Moses you're forgetting something Moses go down and get the bones of Joseph Hallelujah he said you know what will the Holy Ghost do the Holy Ghost will show you things to come and he will remind you everything I taught you and by the bottom would say here that the Holocaust reminded amen Moses Moses amen as you are going out of Egypt don't forget the bones of Joseph don't forget and so mothers roughed them up and here he come and a period of fire leading him onto the promised land and he buried them by the side of Isaac and Jacob and he said why because they know there was coming the fast fruits of them that slept they knowed there was coming a resurrection one of them days hallelujah name of the Lord excuse me here for just a moment and so they know that there was coming a resurrection one of them days he says and then we continue on here job then says they knowed that just one that job said I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day he will stand upon the Earth and they know that the job had an idea where he was going to stand did you hear that that this Patriarchs this you know Isaac Jacob and you know Sarah Abraham he's saying they knew that job had an idea where the Redeemer was going to stand when it comes to fulfill that promise you see the job had an idea where he he was going to stand and so job said by the man I'm saying so job said bury me here yeah I wonder if you knew I come in here believe in the resurrection how many here believe in the coming of the Lord amen and we believe that Jesus Christ is coming back again amen the Lord is coming back to us again the Lord is coming back to us again Saturn will be bound a thousand years we will have no tempted then and the Lord shall come Amen to Earth again amen but let me tell you if you knew where the Lord amen is going to come and stand when he comes amen won't you tell everybody to bother you there here they wanted to be with Joseph they wanted to be with job they buried right around there in Palestine because that was the promised land and they know the resurrection wasn't going to be in Egypt it wasn't going to be in Europe it wasn't going to be somewhere else it was going to be in Palestine so they buried them there Hallelujah and the bride knows the resurrection is not going to happen anywhere out there there is a place where the resolution is going to happen and that's where the bride must be buried Hallelujah oh my let's just continue here and then and so he says Along Came Jesus Along Came Jesus the promised one they done to him what they say they would and oh they killed him oh he died his soul descended into hell preached to the souls that are in prison taking the kids of death and hell away from the devil he returned back on Easter morning and as he come through Paradise he knocked at the door Hallelujah I can hear him say children all them that were buried Hallelujah in Palestine all of them that were buried in faith all of them that were abandoned in that place Hallelujah and by the badam says I can hear him say children and Abraham say who is that imagine if you were Abraham if you were Sarah or if you were a job or if you're one of those and you hear him say children and you had waited you had been buried in that place [Applause] and then says he says I'm your seed the Seed of Abraham Daniel said who is that and he says I'm the stone that was cut out of the mountain Hallelujah Amen Let me just go ahead of myself a little bit to tell you this that the Bride of Jesus Christ over the seven Church ages from the very first church age we are being buried in the same same place and one of these days when he comes by you know the in every generation they had a revelation in every generation they had a revelation they had this much revelation of him but that is what they needed to be buried in that place and now we are the Omega bride we are receiving a full revelation of the full word and we are also being buried here and when he comes amen he will reveal himself to each of us the way we can understand him the Bible says the Bible says we do not know how how we how we shall be but one thing we know when he comes we shall be like him [Applause] hey here comes to Daniel he reveals himself to Daniel in the way Daniel would understand he he comes you know to Abraham can can you imagine that brother Barnum says that Martin Luther was smoking a pipe age messenger and so if the messenger was smoking what about the others but you see that was that much Revelation they had of Jesus Christ and that's what they needed but you see you are not in that age you are now in this age Hallelujah you are the Omega bride oh my God we have received a full revelation of him no all right I'll carry on here he says there they are the Old Testament Saints laying there waiting to be closed upon in Paradise he opened up the door Abraham said are we going out imagine the excitement which was in Paradise that morning are we going out brother amen are we going out it's almost daylight on Earth let's get ready to go and Abraham said can we make a little Whistle Stop I'd like to look at the city there I'd like to look at the city of Bulawayo if you studying I'd like to look at the city and I said well yes I'm going to visit with my disciples for 40 days and on Easter morning he arose Hallelujah and Matthew 27 says that many of the bodies of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth Rose and came out of the city and appeared to many of them in that City I can see Sarah and Abraham coming down the street and say oh honey look there they've changed these these things a little bit oh look around here this looks old somebody said who is that couple who is that couple it seems like they're strangers [Applause] this is going to repeat itself one of these days [Applause] this was just the beginning these were the first fruits and he says they they say oh we are recognized and then they vanished out of their sight like he went through the wall you know and they didn't even know or see him come in went out they had they had glorified bodies and they appeared back on Earth Hallelujah for a fast fruits of the proof of the proofs of God is power and the resurrection anybody who tells you there is no Rapture they don't know what they are talking about this is a proof that is a Rapture this is a proof there is a resurrection friends let's do everything we are doing but let's not get so much swallowed up into the things of the world Let's Get Serious with god let's get serious with a message because that here is your proof of the Rapture the Rapture is going to happen one of these days is bound to happen it must happen nobody can stop it not even the devil in hell he cannot stop it it must happen how many believe it say Amen tonight and he said there they was robbed and stripped oh my good Lord he said there he was they robbed and stripped principalities and took death and hair and smothered it up and Rose up on Easter morning and entered into the kingdom of the Kingdom with him Hallelujah and he says no one that they said Barry me in Palestine they know the resurrection was going to be in ballester thank you Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that we is going to be a group of people that are going to come from all parts of the world there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all aflame let me tell you there is a witness everywhere in every part of the world where I was in benoni Pastor mahere said hey so you are also there in Uganda so we are also here down in Johannesburg I said yes and he said yeah for sure there is a witness everywhere how are you Hallelujah that is going to be a witness everywhere [Applause] we are going to Street principalities Hallelujah people are going to take deaths and Hell Hallelujah says amen people that are going to rise out of the death of Lord is here people who are going to overcome sin people who are going to overcome all this mess in our generation they are going to be a people I believe I'm one of them I believe I'm one of them oh one of the one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I say bury me here also bury me here you know what is the message of Yahweh what is the message let me let me just take a moment to allow brother banam tell us what the message is in the message the talking he says we are not come together talk about the message I love this quote I always read it whenever I get a chance he says we'll not come together talk about the message we have come together to get in the message and he says and the message brother do you have the court up there I would have allowed the people to read it with their own lips and he says and a message you have it now let all of us be that part and the message is Christ you do get it do you get everybody let us read it and the message is he is the word the message is Christ he is the word we are to get into it we are to get beneath it yes sir that is what we are supposed to do the message is not words of a man called William Branham the message is Christ [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah the message is the Holy Ghost the message is Christ and I'm not saying when you believe it and accept it in your head you have received the Holy Ghost no you must have an experience of this Christ because the message if it is Christ he has a life he has his way about him he has his own character he has his own nature when you believe it you must receive that Christ in your life and then he gives you his nature he gives you his way he gives you his character and then you begin to sing the things I used to do I do them no more [Applause] Hallelujah so if the message now is Christ Hallelujah I want to say bury me in Christ in the message Hallelujah friends I came in the message to die here to be buried here because this is the only place in our generation that Christ is going to come and meet the bride there is no other place all other places are dead lodges that sounds a bit rude but it's the truth there is no life he says when they denominate they die when they organize they die the message can never be organized the bride can never be denominated that's why I'm telling you this is the place where we must be buried Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] and then he said I'm continuing with the quote I was reading initially it says there are for today brother you can have whatever you want to oh the old cold formal religion you want to oh tell your neighbor bury me in Christ but I mean Christ for those that are in Christ will God bring with him in the resurrection say whatever you want to amen and call it a fanaticism whatever you want to do but just let me stay in him for those that are in him he's coming out of the Grave on the resurrection for God shall bring them up he promised to do it amenam says amen and I also added amen [Music] [Applause] let them say that they left the message how can you leave the message sincerely it's just like it's just like Abraham saying that he left the grave how can you leave the grave you a dead man how can you leave the grave ah you said how can you leave it you were dead you are you were married you can't there's nothing you can do until he comes to take you home let me tell you if you come in the message and you're buried here there is no way you can say I'm now leaving the message you are dead hey man he says I am dead and the life that I now live is not mine amen my life is healed Hallelujah in Christ in the midst of the hour I am dead to the things of the world there is no way you can be dead and again you are leaving how can you live when you are dead you are a dead man you are buried there until the rapture Hallelujah [Applause] oh my doesn't that make you feel good oh my praise the name of the Lord the purpose of the devil the purpose of the devil is to try and bring us confusions to try and bring New Revelations to try and bring this and try to bring that but let me tell you if God called you if you had an experience when you believe this message there is no way you can be discouraged to leave okay even when things you know some people say you see in the message there is no this there is no that everything we need is in the message of the hour I'll tell you this a dead man does not need anything out in the world he everything he needs is in that grave you know what they were about it they are the only thing they needed was the resurrection that's the only thing they needed and the only thing we need now amen we are waiting upon his coming we are we are waiting for the trumpet of the Lord amen he says in in the book of First Thessalonians chapter four amen and when the trumpet of those shall stand the dead in Christ shall rise fast the dead in Christchurch right fast then we which are alive and remain so Hallelujah shall be caught up shall be caught up shall be caught up [Applause] time soon brother sister we will be caught up we shall be saved we shall be changed from motto to immortality in the twinkling of an eye that's the only thing we are waiting for now don't you worry hang in there whatever else you need Hallelujah you will receive where you are right where you are that's why I don't believe in believing the message and being and living a defeated life [Applause] listen if you are truly in the message you can't be in the message believe the message and then you are you are living a defeated life where you are living in a life of sin you can't break out of it and you have nowhere to go you have nothing else to help you and you are desperate let me tell you you are in the right place if you are in that condition because that's why God has sent us this message to Deliver Us from the oppression of the devil [Applause] Hallelujah this message has all the solutions we need we shouldn't even look out of the message you know for our Solutions whatever we need is here tell your neighbor whatever we need is here oh my God hallelujah Oh Glory to God oh my I'm about to finish so you just hang in there listen to this he says uh finish that quote he says what difference does it make if you are getting old he says well glory to God what does that have anything to do with it I'm closer Home amen [Music] he says all glory I'm going to call you're going to call me a holy Lord anyhow you might as well get started right now all right how wonderful amen that's enough to make a Holy Roller out of you [Applause] why how can I keep from being happy how can you keep me from being happy how can I keep from being happy I know that that's the truth why sure I am happy and everybody that's good that hope is bubbling up Hallelujah everybody that has that hope of Resurrection is bubbling up why are we happy Hallelujah because we have received something the world cannot give Hallelujah you see there's someone says oh when I get happy I sing and I shout that devil don't believe it I see will you sing with me now have there isn't a doubt and that's what the matter with me the devil doesn't like it when should when a child of God you know when you are when you come and you know your promise and you receive a revelation a full revelation of the promise of your day the devil doesn't like it because you have enough to destroy everything else that will come at you all the doubts all the fears all the Demons of Lord this year the bride is equipped with enough in this message to destroy them to destroy them and that's why the devil will want to keep us away from this world hmm like like Pastor said like Pastor said allow me to say this with all respects like Pastor said and to all of you who are streaming us tonight if truly what you have received is the truth you ought to be here here [Applause] you ought to be here because we are living it we are living in the last hour yes I know you know the hassles of life and all this and all that and all this yeah I understand all that I'm a human also but listen we need to understand we are living in the very last hour Hallelujah there is something that we have that the religions out there don't have and if we have something but I'm saying we ought to be bubbling up [Music] not bubbling up when you are taking tea when the preacher's preaching but bubbling up when you're in charge saying amen shouting running around saying Glory Hallelujah this is where you ought to be but I'm said what are they out there in the denominations they are just Sunday Believers and the Christians they're nominal Christians we shouldn't be we owed able to set more on fire [Applause] we appreciate the man of God uh Dr ngwenya how God has used him I've had great testimonies about him and our people there follow him and I know that you in have had a lot and I'm challenged myself I want to do more for God I I told Pastor I said ah we have not done anything I really need to go back home and serve God indeed that's the truth but while I'm being challenged let me also challenge you now Hallelujah you need to put away more on fire the fire you had in the beginning don't let it out be bothered in the message with all your soul with all your heart with everything that you have don't allow love this church

everything and they were like oh no you know this is nothing we you know we can agree we can understand we can have an understanding and you don't have to pay you know this is what the devil was

has been very busy but he spent time to be with us in order to thank Pastor said and our Reverend um but our witness for coming with them here and I want to thank the Lord also for safe travels that come back home I'm also one of the visiting ministers here right when he just finished preaching brother Hillary was he just pulled me I said is it can we have him once and I said ah he's he's with the elders they in arises can we cheat them because there are some of the things we end up planning you know when you are blessed when I just said to me for a short time at the surgery I could predict this you know when something is in somebody it doesn't take seconds you know you can tell that there's something and also judging from the testimony of opening those two churches in Ethiopia when you are going for your honeymoon it's a big something when something is in a man it cannot be heated it's going to show forth and I believe that starting from the testimony through the quotation through the service someone was encouraged and someone was also provoked to do something for God our Cave of my pillar is in hiding in Christ and one of these days we shall have that Rapture as you are saying that the purpose of the message I like that one is the body change and there are many blessings of the message that are incentives but that is not the main purpose so no one must miss that coming Rapture um we thank the Lord and we thank him for coming this way and this is not the full coming person I think you should come when the old church is here and um on a good Sunday or good weekend meeting we'll see how possible that can be so less for our heads as we pray our heavenly father we thank you for this service we thank you Lord father for the anointing that we felt your presence that we felt further through as you are ministering like those who were going to a mouth they said did not our husband when we are speaking father I know there's been great impartation as the word was going forth in our Lord I know someone has a testimony in the making someone Lord father will come and say surely from that day things are not the same father I pray that that anointing that Holy Spirit Will provoke each one of us to stand in their purpose to work for you while they stay alone for the way with the ability while we have the chance to do so anointed his father heal the sick and deliver the captives unsaving those who are online who are watching with us today Father may you anoint your servant and give him strength and shall be going forth a lord for the preaching throughout the nation in our day and wherever he shall go may be a blessing as he has been a blessing to us father we feel that new connections has been met in Fellowship in friendship and further even in the
