I go I have one quotation from Brother Bram about our Sunday School uh it says now look at this little story right here read between the lines I love it between the lines Why look at these little children going out and making funny making fun of this preacher that was baldheaded look at look what they say to him they said go up thou bald head like Elijah want you like maybe your children moing preachers or what they didn't believe that that Elijah went up uh they doubted it their priest and them had told their priests and them had told them now oh he didn't go up it's just some fanatism and that guy supposed to be Anointed with the same anointing that he was anointed oh it's nonsense tell him to go up they are mocking him and here went up little kids bring up a child in the way that it should go and here they went down because the parents did not believe it and H and and how and how can you expect your children to go to Sunday school and serve the Lord when you yourself don't even go there some sharp words brother Bram used down here in the courts May I'll tell you go and read go and read about it there are some sharp words that I cannot tell you right now about our Sunday

give you praise in Jesus name amen amen amen you may seated for just a few moments amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord how many prayed for for us while we were in thank you for your prayers amen God answered your prayers it was not entirely an easy trip as far as um you know the Logistics and you know the movements uh because we our got an issue know the road from Moro to to ctio is not good so uh we had to Flat tires no not really flat tires one car actually completely bust and there was no no tire that could fit on our while we were returning to C fromo then even the spare tire gave so and it was in a very difficult spot I knew it because I had been told but I tried to behave and look like there was no problem because I had uh foreign brothers and I do not want to scare them you know if you're the pilot and and you know you look scared everybody will be scared so I tried to put up a very stable face but the fact is I was scared and you know uh you know about the cattle riders in and you know they could come any time we think there's stability but you never know what to expect and um you know it was around I think 3 400 p.m. so some people gave us hope they're bringing a tire so we waited they brought several tires it all could not fix and so we were there up to around 8 when now it on us that there's no other option so we now knew officially we are stranded in the middle of nowhere I asked a few people to pray my family and others I believe you pray and then someone came up and told us but there is a uh there is a um how do they a detach I at a certain close by school detach means a few maybe about 40 soldiers um so we we told the other man said no that detach is not existent so we do not know who to believe but the one who was saying there is a detach was a brother the one who was saying there are no solders nothing is not a Believer so I chose to believe the believer because this other man who was not a Believer was suggesting to us that we could actually drive uh more than 17 kmet on this tire on this spare tire which was almost completely getting green and you know if you reach in the middle and it is completely gone now the situation which was bad has become worse but you see the place where they were suggesting that there's soldiers about 2 km so we I decided to drive the two k so the brothers were with hoed into the other car carried brother brother Walker and brother and uh we we we went to that place when we reached the gate it was a soldier with a gun full updf I was iide a side of relief so now we know that even if we were to sleep here at least we have protection and I asked this liant how many soldiers he had he said about 40 men so 2 kilm away from that incident I believe it was God who planned that that we shall have that security and I believe there were more with us than those who were physically keeping us it was a long day in cedo Brother Gary had preached two Services very tired all of us very tired Timothy was even helping change the and uh you know if I was Brother Gary I would never have looked for someone better to travel with me Timothy was a real real help to us and so um we were all tired all worn out um you know barely had sleep so I looked at Brother Gary I told him you're going to sleep here in the car he said it's all right whatever you say these brothers are Christians amen and so we were there I called up brother Andrew where is sister phib she in the building she she's out there I wish she was here physically to hear this brother if you could ask her to come in and so while stranded there I called brother Andrew you know brother Andrew he works in Mor I told him brother Andre we are stranded we don't know what to do and can you get a tire of course now Moro is about 162 from where we were even if they were going to send anything or send any help it would take about 2 three hours so brother Andrew quickly worked together with the other brothers brother Emanuel and brother benjam uel Benjamin and they the organized brother Benjamin um Emmanuel called mej he said pastor I have a car um for my friend my friend owns it so we could um incidentally I have it at this time so I could arrange and then come pick you up I said brother you were supposed to come ear come so he came together with brother Benjamin they drove more than two hours and then when we saw the lights coming I was just moving around by the Timothy around and we had sat and sat and tired so when we saw the lights coming like praise so the Brothers AR uh we we went into the car and off we went to Mor I was just praying Lord let us not have another problem with any tires here and we left our car there I told the soldier if you keep it well I'll make you happy so so they kept it well and the following day we got the car back after working on tires and the Lord did US good Saints we had a very wonderful meetings Ino about a thousand Believers or more and you know listen to the word and also we were in mat where we had um I don't really know the numbers but the brothers were estimating more than 2,000 so they came from all over the side of napak District so it was really a good time with the Believers and we we we finished everything with a prayer line so I just wanted to say thank you for your prayers um those regions not many people even here in CA preachers want to go there because it is difficult to you know move around and deal with the people but God gave us Grace and the brothers were very good to us received us and and and you know God also gave grace to the ministering brother that he was very patient um you know they were they didn't give us trouble they were eating the food the people were eating there and I told Brother Gary and I know this is life it's all right I told him something I said I have been in contact with many brothers from the [Music] west but I made a comment and I said the last time I saw a Christian in the not to say that the others are not Christian but I said the last time I saw a Christian in this manner when I was interacting with brother Edis these brothers are really Believers of the message they they don't make you to feel that they are from another country special Brother Gary calls himself a servant and um I I think I'm so blessed to be associated with a man like that and so before we invite brother Gary I just want to give a little introduction of him years ago uh when I was still in um in in um uh maybe before we do that I see sisters coming let us have a little chorus we have the dedication and then iuce Brother Gary and have him come bring them [Music] in bring them bring them in from the FI nice to say your sister bring them in everybody sing it now bring the in bring the little ones to Jesus brother Andrew unfortunately is not able to be with us today you know he's inja but he told me Pastor I feel sorry that I'm not able to be there but i' like my baby to be dedicated so they named him na uh is that David the name Davon davan and brother Andrew told me there's another name Godfrey is a good name for you remember how Jesus Christ met him I told him a man with no guy and may may he be so that he will have a clean heart and a love for God and that he will serve God shall we bow our heads and [Music] dedicate let us pray our precious kind Heavenly Father we want to thank you so much today for the life of brother Andrew and his wife and how Lord they have dedicated their life to serve him and Lord here you've given them a band of [Music] Joy deian deian Baka Baka Lord we want to as they have brought him to you want to give him back to you and Lord my desire and prayer for him Lord as Lord was a man of that kind that he also keep this little boy that will grow into a man who have a clean heart for God who will Ser God Faithfully like his parents Lord he will live for you Lord he will be a man that this world is not worthy I pray oh God you will use him Lord as he grows may you keep him may you protect him father let the blood of Jesus Christ be about father Lord there many sicknesses keep him away from it there many demons in keep aware from them Lord and I pray that Lord the angels of God will always watch over him and you'll provide for the mother for the father that they have enough resources to take care of him Lord we dedicate now to you in the name of our Lord Jesus chist amen looks very I don't know if you took after the mother or the father God bless you Sister pH we appreciate you do you appreciate them amen sister phib is one of the leaders of our land church and her team was the best this week God bless you amen so we we are going to have the minister uh many years ago when you know of course some of you already know the testimony we had our honeymoon in Ethiopia when we of course when we got married with my wife and so uh while there God you know um helped us to witness the starting or the should I say the in introducing of the message in the country and so I would usually occasionally send out emails there many pastors who were on the on the email list and so Brother Gary was one of them and they to you know read those emails and see the testimonies of what the and so in about four years when the church was already established um and we're just now preaching we had a little congregation I don't remember how many [Music] maybe then Brother Gary surprised me and he said he was coming to Ethiopia and uh I think he was going through going somewhere so by pastors so he came and uh he minister to the people then we were really blessed but then he God placed a burden in his he said uh do these people have the messages message books I told him no not yet he said he would like to buy for every family um um uh the library a library of the message all the available printed messages of brother bham so vot for those families I still remember a few there was Brother G family's family brother Ephraim AED I think a few other about 10es and um all these families he bought these books for the brothers are preachers of this message and um uh brother moras is the pastor of the church in where at the time we were pastoring and brother is working with him Brother G is doing his own work and brother Ephraim is also God is using him to do a wonderful work in the southern part actually he was telling me I I would not mention the number because I've not seen but he was telling me to expect hundreds of people because this week we are headed there we going to have a convention with only the people he has been reaching out him telling me hundreds I mean that must have been a lot of work and yet brother was the youngest among and so we talking about something like four years of work you know preaching the me this message is a lot of Labor it takes Grace no compromise having a back bone to stand for the truth because when you compromise many people can accept but when you stand for the truth many people don't but you see it takes a man to really have a backbone to start so just pray for us as we shall be going to aasa to have those meetings I'll be going with Brother G it be wonderful for him to see after so many years what and brother G has quite a testimony I was blessed to meet his wife uh when they came to Ethiopia they came together his wife wrote this book and if you see the title of this book it says three times dead but still alive and it was written by Deborah Walker now I know you're clapping but you don't know what it's all about if you want to know what it's all about be here at 4M we're going to have an interview by The Walker sister deor you know she has now gone on to be with the Lord but uh you know I met her in little conversations we had I now know because I've spent some little time with brother and I can tell you know even reading a few chapters here what kind of manner of woman she was uh these are real Believers of this message and not only Believers but they have also lived the life so here is a man that died three times but yet still alive I believe it is it was meant also for us to hear whatever God took him through he has been molding his character for such a time as this all the way from Australia just to come here and be a blessing to us maybe there might be someone suffering or going through certain you know difficult situations in life he is a man who has really suffered lost a lot and died once and twice and three times and but yet still alive to testify of the goodness of and um we have had myself a great opportunity to be with him in carja had him Minister um I noticed that he he has a teaching min Ministry he he he he speaks in a very calm way I should say but at the at the end of the sermon you feel like you have eaten something so rich and you feel you have already grown that's what I felt in the four services so you are in for something good I want you to be sober to say Amen to the word I want you you know he cannot preach like me I cannot preach like you but is a gift of God man of God God has sent to us this morning I mean I don't believe God can send someone all the way from Australia come here for you to do for you to walk out let's stay inside if you are streaming the service don't be stay in one place don't be I know there are those like sister Monica told me she not able to come in the service stay in one

root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you amen that's the word of Creation in your mouth now from the beginning God revealed himself right at the beginning as the Lord and then uh in The Exodus just before the Exodus God reveals himself as I am and then in Exodus 6 the Lord revealed himself as Jehovah so in the beginning he was showing us a little bit of himself as the Lord and then he showed himself as I amh thank you brother could you put it in the front again okay we got it we got it praise the Lord okay okay so the Lord revealed himself as the Lord and then he revealed himself as the the I am and then he showed us a little more of an angle of himself as Jehovah then in Joshua chapter 5 he shows himself as the captain of the host then in judges six he shows himself to Gideon as an old man in the gospels Jehovah revealed himself as Jesus of Nazareth in Mark 16 after the resurrection he showed himself in another form God has been showing us glimpses of himself because he's too great to to be revealed in one moment God is far too great to be described as soon as we try to describe him we reduce him because God is perfectly Indescribable in 1933 he revealed himself as a pillar of fire in 1963 he showed us a pillar of cloud which brother Bram said that's our Lord up there and now God is revealing himself in a multi-member body because right from the beginning brother brandom said God wanted to be the god of the audience the god of the audience amen that you were chosen in him not next to him not in front of him not behind him you were chosen in [Music] him so right at the beginning before God was God before they were Angels before there was atoms before there was light before there was Darkness there was nothing only Jehovah God Elohim El the self-existing one and he spent all time and all space all by himself he was God there was nothing but God and you were chosen in him now God is too great to choose because he knows the beginning from the end so when God chose you he didn't go down to a supernatural Supermarket of souls again and say I'll have that one but I have that one and I'll have that one and I'll have that one but not that one we choose like that we use words to try to paint a mental picture but God cannot choose because he knows the beginning from the end so when you were chosen in him there was nothing to choose from but himself there was only god there was nothing but Elohim and you were chosen so when God chose you he chose himself hallelujah amen that means when you show up God shows up when you've been born again it's God of the audience right from the beginning God had a thing in his mind that he wanted to achieve and the prophet said when God thought of you remember God can't have thoughts God's too great to have thoughts thought are higher than our so we use words to try to Des something but when God thought of you brother Bram said he thought of himself being Tang God tangible the god of the audience and now God is showing a part of himself this is the collective personality of God this is the side of God that Satan has never seen before God is too great to be revealed in one person but we are chosen in God when there was nothing else but God to choose we are the collective personality of God we are the side of God that no one has seen before we are the god of the audience what Satan has never dreamed of that's why you can live a life that Satan doesn't know what to do with you because he's dealing with the word again this is the god of the audience the colle personality of God can you say Amen now the shadows of a previous Revival you always dance before the door of the current Revelation I said the shadows of a previous Revival mockingly dance before the door of the open Revelation this goes beyond the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Ram said justification made a way for sanctification he said sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet said the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the person of the Holy Ghost and you are the person you are the person you're not a Doctrine you're not a good idea you are the person of the Holy Ghost we are the collective personality of Jehovah God we are the side of God that no one has seen before this goes beyond Pentecost this goes beyond church this goes beyond religion this goes back to God God wants to be the god of the audience and here we are here we are that's why God sent a prophet not to make us religious not to form another organization but to identify who we are in Christ the collective personality of God Amen so we don't want to trip up over things that are behind us sir justification is behind us we thank God for justification believe justification and we move forward sanctification and we believe in sanctification a must that be sanc without Holiness you'll know why is no God and we thank God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now is the age of adoption it's not here ye God it's not here ye God now it's hear ye him we are collective personality the collective personality of one God ye him the age of adoption so we don't want to trip up over things that are behind us we want to move forward in the Holy Ghost brother Bram said that's the word made flesh in human being brother Bram said the Holy Ghost living his life in human beings not just the prophets thank God for the prophets thank God for the the message but it's not about the prophet it's not about the message it's about you God sent you Elijah God sent you Elijah God sent you a message because it's all about the God of the audience chosen in him when there was nothing else to choose from so when God chose you he chose himself and here we are the collective personality Amen brother said God Jesus said will be manifested otherwise in the last days in human beings God will be manifested in human when God thought of you he thought of himself being tangible the prophet said now may they see the revelation of God in human [Music] beings the revelation of God in human amen okay if I un can I unload amen God the revelation of God manifest in the human beings God manifest manifesting himself the part of himself that was from the beginning because we are not forgiven we are redeemed amen and if we are redeemed we have gone back to where we came from and God is without sin brother said you are never lost you just came with amnesia but God sent you a prophet to break that spiritual and now you can say I am [Music] the prophet said the son of man will be revealed in a body of Flesh you people the church the son of man will be revealed in a body of Flesh you people the church what is it God of the audience God being made tangible the beginning of the creation of God the word made flesh again not forgiven I said not forgiven I said not forgiven but redeemed going back to where we came from amen Revelations one says he has made us Kings and Priests now we don't want to trip up over things that are behind us spiritually speaking yeah don't trip up over things that are behind we've been made Kings and Priests this message of the hour can only be understood the prophet said by a prophetic class of people that means the word come to you Pentecost rejects it but the word comes to you why because you're a prophet it can only be understood by a prophetic class of people the prophet said she has she has th say so you're a prophet so you're a prophet a priest and a king that friend is Mallu Adam was a prophet a priest a king King David was a prophet a priest and a king amen amen Jesus was a prophet a priest and a king St Paul was a prophet a priest and a King William brandham was a prophet a priest and a king you are Prophet a priest and a king this is God the god of the audience want to be hallelujah hallelujah the prophet said the son of man will be revealed in a body of Flesh you people the church the prophet said Christ coming to his body that don't mean just me I'm not the body I'm a member of the body so this is Christ coming to the body this is the you part of God this is the you from the beginning this is you a part of the personality of God and together we make up the collective personality of God this is what Satan has never seen before huj in the beginning when Satan was cast out of Heaven he was cast out with Fury he was cast out into darkness and then when he met Messiah he said hey this cannot be this cannot be Jehovah this cannot be the word by cuz I know how God dealt with me and brother Bram said the devil anointed a Roman soldier to pull his beard out he said now we will see him react now we will see whether he's God or not and he pulled a whole chunk of beard out of Jesus face and out came the Flesh and the muscle and he said Jesus said father forgive them andil yes now I know this is not God cuz he had never seen that side of God before Satan will always trip up over things that are behind but the blood of Jesus Christ goes on and on and on we're not tripping up over things that are behind us and now the devil looks at you and he says I know their faults I know their weaknesses this cannot be God because when Jesus rose from the dead he said okay I should have seen that one he was a man with no mistakes so so now what we do when the body Comes The Devil says keep an eye out for people that don't make mistakes this is the side of God that the devil has never seen before amen you see grace needs a partner and the grace the partner that Grace has is called purpose so Grace and purpose have a symbiotic relationship have you ever seen hippopotamus with its mouth wide open a hippopotamus and sitting on the tooth will be a little bird and the bird's pecking on the tooth of at any time the hippopotamus can get crunched but they have a symbiotic relationship the hippopotamus is getting its teeth [Music] cleaned and the little bird is getting something to eat they work together it's got a symbiotic relationship and Grace and purpose have a symbiotic relationship amen if I have a purpose if my purpose is to manifest Jesus Christ again then I need Grace I need great grace and if Grace is going to be gracious it needs something to point it Grace Grace needs faults to be gracious without your faults without your failings Grace sits on the Shelf and abides alone the grace and purpose have a combined relationship so that the program of God keep moving this is what the devil has never seen and here we are so your faults don't Define you your faults do not define you and what and what you're good at does not define you the word defines you and the word wants to be flesh again this is an unconditional Covenant your goodness your goodness it never brought it and your Badness will never dissolve it it's and it can never fail so that the collective personality of God be manifested back on Earth with all its faults and all its failings God can be the god of the [Music] way praise the Lord so with those few words I'm going to start my sermon [Music] [Applause] Hebrews 111 [Music] faith is yesterday is yesterday don't trip up over things that are yesterday don't trip up over things that are behind you amen can you say amen amen Eagles Eagles don't have to think before [Music] flying flight is instinctive you've probably noticed Eagles don't wear parachutes Eagles are not intimidated by other Birds Eagles have an instinct to fly can you say Amen eagles eat together but they fly alone and Eagles are not scared of altitude brother Bram said never fear failure and he said the prophet said Don't Fear fanaticism yes sir we're not adding to we're not adding to we're not taking away we're doing what Eagles do eagles explore and Eagles are not intimidated by other eag amen faith faith is a wonderful thing faith is the substance of things hopeful and you get that faith when you're born again that faith for 2000 years and still no Rapture Faith lays within the subconscious Faith does not lie in the conscience when Mary and Elizabeth met and Elizabeth was pregnant with with John John was dead but the first time he heard the name of Jesus he left a life amen if the name of Jesus will do that to a dead baby what will it do to a church amen Jesus is not one person the whole family is called Jesus Jesus amen the thought is Jesus the Loos is Jesus Jehovah is Jesus Jesus of Nazareth was Jesus but you're the god of the audience and the whole family in Heaven and Earth it's called Jesus so your Prophet a priest and a king like unto Jesus because brother Bram said Jesus was the mower M was prophet priest and King Jesus was prophet priest and King the prophet is Prophet priest and king you are you've got to believe it with with a Hebrews 11 Faith Prophet priest and King and once you believe it you can move on a higher Faith are you listening to me are you listening to me you can move on to a faith that brother said God has just recently created it's called perfect faith and that Faith needs no faith I I'm here to tell you this is where I want to be right now this morning I'm here in your country tell you in you somewhere is a faith that needs no faith I'll exp if you don't understand it you can have faith but as soon as you understand it you can't have Fai a perfect word as come a perfect word there is a faith that has an understanding said this Faith perfect faith has a perfect Revelation that this faith is not Hebrews 11 Faith you had to have you had to have a Hebrews 111 Faith it's a substance of things hopeful but what you hoped for is here amen [Applause] [Music] am when Mary said to Elizabeth or Elizabeth yeah when Mary said to Elizabeth his name is going to be Jesus John left because it was in the subconscious but when John was born and he grew up and he became a man and he said Behold the Lamb of God it takes away the sins of the world he said behold he knew what he was talking about Behold the Lamb of God takes away the sins of the world and then several years later he's in jail and he says go is he the one or do we wait for John did better in his subc [Music] conscience he did with his conscience that's why don't lean to your own understanding amen because when we start to talk about the thought of God being manifested as a body of Believers when we start to talk about God becoming tangible makes no intellectual sense but this Faith the prophet said lies in the subconscious it lies within the subconscious that's why the Bible says we know all things but you don't cognitively know all things you do know all things it's just that we don't know we know all things we've been trying to work it out with our mind and if you work it out with your mind you will trip up over things behind you don't forget you were chosen in him to where when there was nothing nothing to choose from but God that Revelation lays in the subconscious when Jesus rose from the dead the Bible says he appeared in another form and he walked with two people that had known Jesus of Nazareth for three and a half years but because now he's in another form they didn't recognize him and the Bible says the Bible says he opened unto them their own understanding it was in them to know who this other not cognitively it's in you to know who you are if you lean not to your own understanding [Applause] amen amen the Revelation Revelation gives us an understanding brother Ram said pray for Revelation more than anything else and as soon as it's revealed to you you cannot have Hebrews 111 Faith Hebrews 111 Faith was given to you to believe there's a bit of Faith coming that's when you talk about Rapture Fai perfect fath Rapture Faith the Church of yesterday it got nervous they say I hope I can have that faith and they're trying to build up something that it's not there and they're busy working in their cognitive thinking and they're putting themselves further and further and further away from the TR brother Bram said brother said the Rapture will be a revelation you don't need Hebrews 111 Faith forap but when you know what it is brother Bram said then the bride can go who holds the key to revelation God holds that key it's lying in the subconscious now the subconscious forward to theci cannot go back into the subconscious let me explain so when God reveals to you who you are if you know who you are it does not matter what people say you're not you don't need approval you don't need affirmation and the reason for that is God told you and God told you the prophet said that came from your from your Theon he said when you have a revelation your the all things you know all things and a part of all things M forward and you grabbed it and now that you know that you know and when you know that you know don't need Hebrews 111 [Applause] thank God for Hebrews 111 but don't trip up over things that are behind because you were chosen in him and God is not confused about his identity I said God is not confused about who he is so God sent us a prophet to let himself know who you are the god of the [Music] audience it's easier than you think the Rapture is easier than you think have you ever sat there and got scared that maybe maybe you'll be left behind because you don't have enough Faith as a trick of the devil when the time is right you will hear from yourself St John he was at the cross he was at the foot of the cross he saw Jesus die he saw Jesus go into the tomb and an early Sunday morning he witnessed an empty tomb amen and then John fellowed with the resurrected Jesus for 40 days and then on the aisle of pmos in chapter five John is weeping because he missed it John was there John read the book John had a big Bible John went to a good church and missed it I said he missed it completely he was weeping because he thought in his mind no one's worthy but he's seen an empty tomb fellow with the resurrection Jesus and missed it he missed it so one of the elders came to John 24 Elders they are made up of the 12 Patriarchs in the Old Testament and the 12 apostles in the new test John was one of those apostles who came to John and said John came to John John came to John who did you hear from the prophet said you heard from your the you came to you and said don't weep this is the purpose of God and if there's a purpose of God then there's great grace to accompany so the fault does not define you and your strength do not define you it's the word that defines you one day one day you going to come to yourself and say it's going home time amen amen amen don't weep John the lion of the tribe of Judah the one you missed sitting in church for such a long time thinking you're going to miss a Rapture don't weep John who told John that John told John and when God thought of you he thought of himself be tangible so what is your theop god from the beginning a part of the collective personality don't weep John it's going to be okay John you know all things John and while you don't know all things then have a Hebrews 111 fa when you know that you know you don't need Hebrews 111 anymore John John don't weep it's been revealed to us we are the briad of Christ and you're not you're not forgiven we have been [Applause] redeemed everything that Adam lost the prophet said we have now the only thing out of order is the [Music] body the prophet said if go in the Rapture you have to have the same spirit in you that Jesus had in him are you listening to me okay now don't don't don't use your mind brother said the devil he said all hell is against this Revelation that you as an individual so I'm in Christ is the mystery of God revealed 28th of July 1965 all hell is against this Revelation that the fullness of the Holy Ghost like Jesus in the IND not not not not as a her of believers but you as an individual are the same Jesus but in the bright form this is what the devil has never seen before deity with fults [Applause] and the devil says you are crazy Pentecost says Pentecost you are crazy but the prophet said Don't Fear fanaticism Eagles are not intimidated Eagles have an instinct to fly and Eagles don't wear parachutes amen hallu amen come on don't cry John it's going to be okay John it's G to work out John the lion of the tribe of Judah has Reva John amen can you say Amen when it is revealed you can no longer have Hebrews 111 fa I want to give you an example in the I'll close the prophet is's walking along and he's thinking about the scripture if ye say unto this mountain and the Lord said to the prophet what what are you after brother said I'm after three squirrels and the Lord says well why don't you speak this is not the age of hear ye God this is the age of hear ye him so God will present it to you from your the I didn't get it brother I didn't get that God will present it to you from your which knows all things and God will bring it forth to your mind and now free moral agency now free moral agency takes over now what did you going to do about and brother BR said well I'll have a squirrel appear over there and the squirrel appears and the prophet said I put my rifle down I rubbed my eyes and he thought Am I Dreaming perfect Faith he says that I put my rifle down I rub my eyes and I thought Am I Dreaming Hebrews 111 Faith doesn't work like that brother brandham couldn't believe Hebrews 11:1 brother Bram couldn't believe that the squirrel had appeared this is a higher faith this is a cry not faith we not John the lion of the tribe of Judah has reviled God's not interested in your Hebrews 11 God wants to know will you speak [Applause] it where did it come from your Theon it's presented to your mind and now a word is a thought expressed perfect fa requires no faith perfect Faith requires obedience hear ye him brother B said I put my rifle down he said I'll rub my eyes he said I'm I'm a dreaming and he said well that that's nice and the Lord said where's the second one he said oh over there and it appeared and he looked at it he said I shot it and I went and picked up that one and I went and picked up that one and I said Thank You Jesus and I turned around and I started to walk home and the Lord said hey said [Applause] three Hebrews 111 it's not hey said three Hebrews 111 Faith it's your substance but perfect faith is God's [Music] [Applause] substance I put my rifle down I rub my eyes I said I must be dreaming this is perfect thing this is a faith that requires no faith this is a faith is you talking to you waiting for your free moral agency to be obedient to the inspiration of [Applause] God amen amen amen can you say Amen this is who you are this is your purpose justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and make no mistake about it you must be born again but the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the person the person of the Holy Ghost you are the person of the Holy Ghost don't weep John purpose requires grace and grace requires purpose brother Bram said you need God and God needs God needs you one if one of you is Left Behind God is not complete not one will be left behind why it's because we don't put Hebrews 111 Faith to it God help us we've been doing that for 2,000 years and there's no Rapture so it was sealed Rapture fath in your subc brother Bram said the book was sealed and so were you he said the book was sealed that's what Adam lost he said the book was sealed and so are you but in the evening time by the evening time message the book the book is unsealed you are unsealed this is not church this is not religion this is not a Doctrine this is the person of the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost the prophet said has been bound for 2,000 years you cannot bind up Jehovah the church the church has been ignorant for 2,000 years but in the evening time the evening time message the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost you the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen so in you somewhere each bride member you know all things you even know the second of the Rapture but God said I reserve that to myself and he put it in the subconscious and he said you can't work it out no man knows power but when I bring It Forward you know and as soon as you know you don't need Faith you're just going to walk into the next step the briide goes on and on and on hallelujah amen amen so in the beginning God said let us make man in our own what was that logos logos Pillar of Fire Adam was logos Adam was a pillar of Fire Adam was a holy ghost Adam was a holy spirit because he was made in the image of God and John said we don't know what we shall be but when he shall appear then we will know what we will and 1933 the prophet said he appeared what appeared Pillar of Fire so for 2,000 years I've been ignorant it does not yet appear what we shall be but when he appears then we'll know what we are and we can even know as we are known so 1933 the FY appeared so now I know I'm not the body I'm logos I'm a pillar of fire son chosen in him when there was only him to choose from and in the rising of the sun brother BR said the pillar of fire has been waved over the people that there's a whole crop coming like this one there coming a whole church of prophet priest and King there's a whole church it'll say hey hey me me listen to me me I didn't know I was me the message came I didn't know who I was so there's a people coming they can look at themselves said don't weep don't weep John the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed we have got great grace to achieve a great purpose and the purpose of God the prophet said was to bring forth the people likened unto [Applause] himself don't be scared of rep today don't get nervous about the Rapture the Rapture is in you paragraph 240 paragraph 240 page 35 if you got the book top right hand corner top right hand corner of the page last sentence in the paragraph of Christ The Mystery of God 28th of July 1963 the prophet said when she knows that's coming from back here your subconscious real when she knows what it is he did not say the Rapture will come he said the Rapture will go you are the Rapture everything that you have need of is every Revelation that you need is because the Bible says you know all things it's just that we don't know that we know all things but I want to leave you my friends and I ask you please don't be scared of rapture it's easier then you think it'll come to you the prophet said it's a revelation and when it's revealed to you you don't need no faith you just know you will know that you know next step is a higher reality amen stand with me [Applause] please amen let's be our heads and close your eyes with our heads B and our eyes closed is there anybody here and it's a very real thing I've preached in dozens of countries is a very real thing and you're not alone is there anybody here you've been fearful of the rapture is there anybody here that the devil has got the advantage and made you think there's a chance you could be left behind simply because your faith is insufficient is there somebody here who thought that the Rapture involved Hebrews 111 and you misunderstood it's a lot easier than you think you would like to be prayed for Lord reveal it to me open unto me my own understanding that I am the Rapture if you like to be prayed for

manifested into the world the the nature the character of Christ reflecting through your brain Lord help us to be there father Lord we ask that you bless the man of God our precious brother Pastor Gary Lord You've used him Lord to shake shake us up remind us who we are where we came from and where we are going maybe someone here who was found by fear they have been released from we thank you we bless your name I ask that Lord you will bless each of us even as we shall dismiss this service shortly that your grace will continue to abound in our thank you Jesus just give him a clap of praise [Applause] amen you know you can seat or stand whatever you want from the message the seed shall not be as the brother plays slowly a little bit the seed shall not be here with a shark listen to this a prophet says that man fell like the seed has to fall and then God be to brood over that after the fall he brought up a Enoch he brought up a Elijah he brought up a Moses he brought up a prophet after after Prophet trying to restore that image again and finally upon the Earth came that genuine image of God God himself again are you following which was God the logos made flesh and dwelt Among Us you believe that say amen that's that's what Jesus was and then he continues on to say now that same logos has a but he has got a bride and that same L this word that cannot be tempered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation which the prophets was carriers to that se they were carriers yes and the church denominations has been carriers to that seed now now notice quickly but like the shark hugs holds in the seed now then it leaves her the seed shall not be here with a sh and because we are seed we are a part of the logos you know when I was hearing Brother Gary preach I would say you know someone if someone doesn't believe you would say that is a hard saying and maybe some of you it was over the top of your head that's a hard saying how many receive the Revelation by the way if you receive this Revelation you walk free you don't walk like oh now I may miss the Rapture it's not because of you your works or your faith even isn't it what I've been preaching here I've been preaching the same thing by the faith of the Son of God and that is a revelation you receive it by Revelation and the other part of the person of Jesus Christ I told Brother team I i' never seen it that way I want to challenge you go back and listen to that it is the rising of the Sun the prophet says and as he being the groom he talking about Christ the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoken about the bride it can only man if it can only manifest if it does something different from the [Music] groom are you the bright if your life is different from the life of the groom your works are different from the works of the group then he says it isn't the bright it can only manifest because amen she is the Flesh of his flesh born of his born life of his life power of his power see is him is there someone here tonight amen this morning swimming in this Revelation today she is him as a man and a woman are one woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the femin spirit the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics and I believe we are the church has both the mechanics and the Dynamics of the world Amen I have many more sermons to preach to you amen amen let us wait for the visitors to go then I'll will preach to you how many have been blessed let us give the Lord a clap of Praise hallelujah
