[26:16] chapter 19.
[26:18] when you start with the verse 1.
[26:22] you will read it in your own time
[26:25] because of time we shall take some
[26:28] little verses
[26:35] Angels Came From Heaven
[26:37] with God
[26:39] absolutely
[27:31] [Music]
[28:12] it wasn't according to God's willing
[28:18] you identify students

[28:25] Hallelujah and they reached somewhere
[28:29] and then a grudge Rose among them
[29:30] and then he told him
[30:24] so the Bible says when Lord looked like
[30:28] this
[30:29] he saw a beautiful plane now foreign
[31:32] foreign
[32:32] Hallelujah
[32:52] so they worked

[32:57] Hallelujah
[32:59] God never talk to Abraham
[33:05] done something which displeased God
[33:09] he did something
[33:12] which was out of God's way
[33:15] that is
[33:21] The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ and
[33:25] it was known until Abraham separated
[33:27] himself with the Lord
[33:30] that is when we find chapter 19 God is
[33:33] coming and visit Abraham
[33:39] Hallelujah we don't have time but when
[33:41] you go in chapter 18.
[33:44] that is
[33:49] understanding rising up between Abraham
[34:38] [Music]
[34:48] that is what God calls you today
[35:19] [Music]
[35:26] [Music]
[35:28] Hallelujah it was just one day a voice
[35:31] came and told him
[35:33] Abraham leave this land of Allah
[35:39] [Music]
[35:42] separated him from the from his kindness
[35:46] it is the same thing some of us we are
[35:50] coming from families
[35:52] foreign
[35:59] [Music]
[36:57] God decided to destroy these cities
[37:02] but before destroying them uh
[37:07] [Music]
[37:38] [Music]
[37:57] [Music]
[38:11] [Music]
[38:31] foreign
[39:08] Jesus Christ
[39:16] let us go
[39:19] praise God we'll come attended us the
[39:21] way let us uh just go a little uh in
[39:25] verse
[39:26] 17 of chapter 18.
[39:38] shall I hid from Abraham that which I do
[39:42] now
[39:44] seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[39:47] a great and mighty nation
[39:53] and all the nations
[40:01] 20 and the Lord said Captain America
[40:04] because the Cry of Sodom and Gomer is
[40:08] great
[40:10] because their sin is very Grievous
[40:15] I will go down now
[40:18] and see whether they have done all
[40:20] together according to the cryos
[40:22] [Music]
[40:25] which is come unto me
[40:28] and if not
[40:30] I will know praise God
[40:34] [Music]
[40:39] with thou also destroyed it right yes
[40:48] so when God disclosed about his plan
[40:52] towards Sodom and gomola to Abraham
[40:58] is fine that I have my brother there
[41:08] his family
[41:11] to plead for Lotus family
[41:14] [Music]
[41:16] because he thought
[41:18] that maybe a lot by now is having a big
[41:21] group group of people
[41:24] maybe he's having a family
[41:26] and his inilos
[41:32] praise God hallelujah so he pleaded
[41:37] Universe
[41:42] within the city
[41:46] now this was Abraham
[41:49] physically
[41:51] with that also destroy a non-spray the
[41:54] place for the 50 righteous that are
[41:57] thereiness
[42:05] that be far from thee now
[42:08] after this
[42:11] select the righteous with the wicked
[42:15] right here should be as the wicked
[42:22] that be far from
[42:25] shall not judge of All Shall Not the
[42:28] judge of all the Earth do right
[42:32] [Music]
[42:36] Sonoma
[42:38] [Music]
[42:44] then I will spare all the place for
[42:46] their sakes
[42:48] now this was Abraham pleading for the
[42:51] Saints or for the righteous ones or the
[42:54] cities of Sodom and gomoran
[42:59] because his brother was in Sodom he knew
[43:02] it very well
[43:05] and by now he thought maybe he's having
[43:08] his wife his children and his in-laws
[43:18] praise God so he kept on breeding yeah
[43:23] just continue
[43:26] Abraham answered and said behold now I
[43:30] have taken upon me to speak unto the
[43:32] Lord which I am but dust and Ashes
[43:35] foreign
[43:48] [Music]
[44:58] he came to uh
[45:02] verse 32 and he said oh let you know the
[45:04] Lord be angry I'll speak yet but this
[45:07] once
[45:14] shall be found there
[45:36] because he never knew very well what was
[45:39] the number of lotus lotus family
[45:49] maybe they are 45. maybe they are 30.
[45:53] till when he reached at number 10.
[47:01] praise God
[47:08] they even never wanted to think about
[47:11] God in their mind
[47:14] praise God so God decided to destroy
[47:18] these cities
[47:20] to get them out of the sight of the
[47:23] world
[47:24] praise God so these Angels Came
[47:28] In The House of Lords to seek for his
[47:32] family
[47:33] [Music]
[47:35] Mighty free from the destruction that
[47:38] was coming
[47:43] Lord
[47:45] come to them
[47:47] hallelujah hallelujah praise God when he
[47:51] welcomed them
[47:52] let us continue on and he said beholding
[47:56] out my Lord stand in now
[47:59] I pray you into your servante's house
[48:08] and I shall rise up and go on you you
[48:12] shall rise up and go your ways
[49:10] all the people from every culture
[49:13] foreign
[49:24] which came into
[49:25] the this night
[49:28] bring them out onto us that we may know
[49:32] them
[49:33] praise God now when the Angels were
[49:37] coming
[49:39] the people of Sodom we are seeing them
[49:44] they entered into the House of Lords
[49:48] so the Bible says these men of Sodom
[49:51] came and surrounded the House of Lords
[49:55] with a purpose of getting out these
[49:59] angels
[50:01] and take them for homosexuality
[50:05] praise God because they were the cities
[50:09] that turned out to be
[50:11] that many never wanted to sleep with
[50:14] their wives
[50:18] they wanted to sit with their fellow men
[50:22] praise God that's how sinful the city of
[50:25] sodomy foreign
[50:34] [Music]
[51:40] [Music]
[52:24] I have to daughters which have not known
[52:27] a man
[52:30] let me
[52:32] I pray you Bambi munde
[52:35] bring them out to you
[52:38] today and doing it to them as is good in
[52:42] your eyes
[52:49] for therefore came they under the shadow
[52:53] of my life
[52:57] praise God so now Lord was staying in
[53:00] Sodom
[53:02] and he knew very well the acts of men
[53:09] so when they constrained him let these
[53:13] men out and they know them
[53:17] Lord try to pleading
[53:20] an extent that he had his two daughters
[53:24] who are still virgins
[53:27] they were staying with him
[53:30] praise God
[54:29] their desires that go and God perverted
[54:33] [Music]
[54:39] an extent that even this man wrote the
[54:42] righteous man by in the city the only
[54:44] righteous one okay
[54:47] now even we find that lot was just a
[54:50] borderline believer
[54:57] foreign
[55:23] [Music]
[56:11] foreign let us proceed
[56:15] actually they even wanted to break the
[56:18] door to pick the Angels by force
[56:23] and they attempted the two
[56:26] praise God first thing but the many put
[56:30] forth their hands
[56:33] now when they talk about the men they
[56:36] are talking about the Angels
[56:40] but the men put forth their hand and put
[56:43] lot into the house
[56:47] [Music]
[56:58] on the house
[57:02] but small and great
[57:06] so that they they worried themselves to
[57:09] find adults
[57:12] foreign
[57:32] [Music]
[58:11] them out of this place
[58:14] you know Hallelujah now a distraction
[58:17] was coming
[58:19] God was going to bring his destruction
[58:23] towards the cities of Solomon cartoon
[58:27] but he had to send a message the warning
[58:31] message fast
[58:34] praise God Amen Hallelujah to serve
[58:37] whosoever shall free
[58:40] to the message to serve whosoever shall
[58:43] free to the message
[58:48] praise God amen hallelujah amen so he
[58:51] sent his angels
[58:57] at the hearing of the message
[59:06] go and tell your daughters go and tell
[59:10] your your friends
[59:12] can't tell everyone you would wish today
[59:16] Mighty free because obstruction is
[59:19] scanning
[59:22] praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
[59:25] because destruction was going to set in
[59:27] a few minutes
[59:33] so we will destroy this place verse 13.
[59:38] because the Cry of them is waxing great
[59:42] before the face of the Lord
[59:47] and the Lord has sent us to destroy is
[59:54] a lot went out and speak unto his sons
[59:59] praise God
[1:00:01] hallelujah hallelujah now it meant that
[1:00:05] Lord had some other daughters
[1:00:09] because this is where his son is
[1:00:14] praise God I mean so he rushed to them

[1:37:07] the Stars didn't come out to give its

[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:15] but it was too late
[1:38:18] he looked and believed

[1:38:28] what he had done had sealed his Doom
[1:38:32] yeah
[1:38:37] he had run the spear through the
[1:38:40] savior's heart
[1:38:46] it was too late
[1:38:50] I wonder how many Romans today have done

[1:39:02] you might look someday

[1:39:41] and that was too late for him
[1:39:44] he had had all the messages from

[1:40:17] angels
[1:40:20] [Music]
[1:40:23] praise God but when she decided to
[1:40:26] intentionally turn and looked back again
[1:40:37] so when we intentionally do what the
[1:40:41] Bible tells us never to do it together
[1:40:45] praise God
[1:40:48] we might cross
[1:40:58] Mercy our way
[1:41:03] and then we might find ourselves on a
[1:41:05] judgment days
[1:41:07] in the same way
[1:41:15] what am I trying to say
[1:41:19] that they see they clearly Vindicated
[1:41:22] word
[1:41:24] like pilate
[1:41:27] and the rest of them
[1:41:30] like the Roman soldiers
[1:41:33] but are you going to wait too late to do
[1:41:37] anything about it
[1:41:43] hallelujah hallelujah he should have
[1:41:46] used the spear the other way
[1:41:51] the doors will be closed
[1:41:55] like it was in the days
[1:41:58] and then it is too late
[1:42:06] so Church of God

[1:42:13] once we came out of the world
[1:42:16] let us not look back like
