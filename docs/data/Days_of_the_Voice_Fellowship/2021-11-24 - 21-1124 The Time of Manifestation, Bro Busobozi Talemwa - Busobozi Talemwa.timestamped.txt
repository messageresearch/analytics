[1:01] [Music]
[1:09] [Music]
[1:38] ah
[1:42] [Music]
[1:53] oh
[6:27] okay so we check our reading from
[6:29] matthew chapter 13.
[6:32] next summer
[6:35] and
[6:36] we're reading from verse 24.
[6:52] another parabol
[6:54] put him forth unto them saying the
[6:56] kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man
[6:59] which sold good seed in his field
[7:02] but while men slept his enemy came and
[7:05] saw tears among the wheat
[7:08] and went his way
[7:09] but when the blood was sprung up and
[7:12] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[7:14] tears also
[7:16] so the servants of the householder came
[7:18] and said unto him sir
[7:21] it is thou it is not thou sow good seed
[7:24] in thy field
[7:26] from whence
[7:27] then
[7:28] has it tears
[7:30] he said unto them
[7:33] an enemy has done this
[7:35] the servants
[7:37] said unto him
[7:38] will do thou
[7:39] then
[7:40] that we go
[7:43] and gather them up
[7:46] but he said
[7:47] nay lest while you gather up the tears
[7:50] you
[7:52] root up also the wheat with them
[7:55] let both grow together until the harvest
[7:57] and in the time of the harvest i will
[8:00] say to the reapers gather ye together
[8:02] fast their tears and bind them in
[8:04] bundles to burn them
[8:06] but gather the wheat into my ban
[8:09] mateo is
[8:37] [Music]
[9:03] [Music]
[9:34] foreign
[9:48] i uh
[9:52] to share on the time
[9:54] of manifestation
[10:09] each of you that are here this evening
[11:49] amen
[11:50] and so
[11:52] we at the time we are living at a time
[11:54] truly movie say that and the message i'm
[11:56] going to share is deeply in my heart
[12:02] and i hope that the lord somehow
[12:04] spiritually will put you on my brother's
[12:05] heart
[12:08] to take
[12:16] [Music]
[12:23] is the usual word of prophets
[12:29] which we have received in our time
[12:34] we are living at a time of manifestation
[12:36] truly
[12:50] right we
[13:06] quicker the world is trying to unite
[13:09] you know when you see the united world
[13:10] council of churches
[13:14] that one brother prophesied that it
[13:17] would be before it was yes
[14:01] make east african union
[14:04] communities
[14:08] if you notice the passports we are now
[14:10] getting the new passports the blue
[14:11] passports they they have east african
[14:14] they are east african community possible
[14:21] uganda east africa whereby you will not
[14:24] be recognized as a citizen of uganda
[14:26] alone but you'll be recognized as a
[14:28] citizen of uganda kenya tanzania sudan
[14:30] and rwanda
[14:35] uganda kenya tanzania
[14:38] and there is also european union
[14:43] and um
[14:44] also there is many unions everywhere
[14:46] trade unions
[14:48] i will now break that down
[14:50] so why
[14:52] this has never been before
[14:56] but it is happening in this generation
[14:58] why would that be two several more
[14:59] because this is the generation that is
[15:03] winding up
[15:05] the
[15:06] life and the human life and the world as
[15:08] we know it
[15:24] so there will be a
[15:27] a an international community
[15:32] one with a world government one world
[15:34] government
[15:37] and one world religion
[16:19] and now i realize that that is where it
[16:21] is headed
[16:23] off
[16:24] but
[16:25] but by the time it gets to that now
[16:28] again
[16:29] the rapture will already have happened
[16:34] and the bride of jesus christ will
[16:35] already have gone in the rapture in
[16:36] heaven
[16:40] because remember by the time the
[16:41] persecutions begin to happen on this
[16:43] earth
[16:48] hallelujah amen by the time we see the
[16:50] persecutions happening on the earth
[16:54] the bride will not be here
[16:57] that will be the great tribulation
[17:03] [Music]
[17:29] all over the world from every nation on
[17:31] earth
[17:34] somehow within their heart
[17:37] they are longing for home
[17:40] they are longing for where we are
[17:42] where we are going
[17:44] not for
[18:11] [Music]
[18:12] we are also at this time which is
[18:14] supposed to be the time of manifestation
[18:23] because
[18:24] every spirit
[18:50] you may have a lot of debates about what
[18:52] is in the soil
[18:57] and you may beat two people or three
[18:59] people four people oh what is the power
[19:02] and the soul may tell them that i
[19:04] planted maize from a season
[19:08] here
[19:22] oh
[19:27] [Music]
[19:48] until it brings forth of its kind
[19:54] [Music]
[20:30] and so he said that the kingdom of
[20:32] heaven is unto a man that went to
[20:35] sausage
[20:42] against but while
[20:44] men slept
[21:11] it is jesus yes he is the one who is the
[21:14] owner of
[21:28] but
[21:42] that is when the devil came and began to
[21:44] sow wrong seed i was sitting where i
[21:47] injured in a nasty and seeking charm the
[21:49] wrong teachings indicating the wrong
[21:52] ideologies
[21:54] wrong understanding
[21:56] things which cannot be established by
[21:58] the word of god
[22:02] that's when you find men preaching
[22:04] baptism of babies
[22:09] that's where you found teachings like
[22:11] purgatory however
[22:14] that's when you find teachings like uh
[22:17] uh presidents i would assume
[22:19] [Music]
[22:21] into independent things that the
[22:23] apostles never
[22:25] [Music]
[22:36] and when the blood was sprung up
[22:40] and brought forth fruit
[22:44] then appeared
[22:45] also
[22:48] when men were sleeping
[23:06] but when the blood was sprung up
[23:10] [Music]
[23:14] the servants of the householder they saw
[23:17] it
[23:20] the
[23:35] [Music]
[24:12] there is nothing that happens in your
[24:14] life without god knowing the
[24:26] where was god when the enemy was
[24:29] planting the tears
[24:38] [Music]
[24:44] [Music]
[25:13] yes
[25:19] he knows the end from the beginning
[25:22] and he has everything figured out
[25:36] [Music]
[25:41] it's like someone coming to steal
[25:43] something from your house in
[25:45] the night when you're watching them on
[25:46] camera
[25:51] look at this one
[25:54] look at him
[25:56] and then he watched him no more do you
[25:58] know because you know you cannot do much
[25:59] much damage
[26:03] and you know you have everything figured
[26:04] out
[26:07] because when you watch a thief
[26:22] in not being discovered
[26:29] if a thief comes in your house in the
[26:31] night or people are indeed a mature
[26:34] people
[26:35] and
[26:36] you you shout you wake up and you shout
[26:38] at him
[26:41] and he tries to open your door
[26:44] even if you don't
[26:48] just speak i can see you never
[27:06] [Applause]
[27:23] [Music]
[28:14] the disciples
[28:27] [Applause]
[28:57] but he thought everybody was sleeping
[28:58] not always unto you
[29:00] but actually
[29:02] when he awoke
[29:06] the disciples when they awoke
[29:09] the servants
[29:25] he knows all things head into your nerve
[29:28] and so he cares
[29:32] so good city do i see my unknown
[29:35] he was just answering them
[29:37] of course we did okay
[29:39] [Music]
[30:05] he said until the time
[30:19] is
[30:34] worked worked in the first hour
[30:42] he will have those who will work in the
[30:43] last hour
[30:47] we are the ones working in this last
[30:53] [Applause]
[31:02] but now you can rest
[31:52] [Music]
[32:13] graham ominously billy graham and we
[32:15] know that these were sent out to bind up
[32:17] the tears
[32:21] [Music]
[32:23] he said buying them up in bandus
[32:25] abandoned
[32:26] [Music]
[33:21] this is the time of manifestation
[33:26] jesus wanted to wait until this time yes
[33:32] there would be no more hypocrisy
[33:35] i request foreign
[34:04] you can see it with your naked eyes
[34:09] every seed in the time of the harvest
[34:12] would be bringing forth of its kind
[34:21] just like his words saying in the book
[34:23] of genesis
[35:55] must be made
[36:03] the seed of god will manifest themselves
[36:08] and the seed of the devil will also
[36:09] manifest
[36:12] [Music]
[36:19] [Music]
[36:35] there's something i want to show you
[36:36] here why don't you change
[36:38] praise the name of the lord
[36:43] and he also talks about the children of
[36:45] god being manifested
[36:55] hallelujah
[37:14] read first john chapter 3.
[37:20] it's okay
[37:30] let no man deceive you he that doeth
[37:32] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[37:35] righteous he that committed sin is of
[37:38] the devil for the devil sinners from the
[37:40] beginning for this purpose the son of
[37:42] god was manifested that he might destroy
[37:44] the works of the devil whosoever is born
[37:47] of god does not commit sin for his seed
[37:49] remains in him and he cannot sin because
[37:52] he's born of god in this the children of
[37:55] god are manifest and the children of the
[37:57] devil whosoever that do with not
[38:00] righteousness is not of god neither he
[38:02] that loveth not his brother
[38:15] anger
[38:22] [Music]

[38:46] [Music]
[38:58] way
[40:22] oh
[40:36] only those who
[40:49] that we should love one another
[40:51] not as cain who was of that wicked one
[40:54] and slew his brother and when i first
[40:56] leave him because his own works were
[40:57] evil and his brother's right yes
[41:12] [Music]
[41:32] did not love
[42:00] [Music]
[42:11] that is why we also help one another
[42:30] [Music]
[42:41] foreign
[43:24] if you tried to pretend that you are a
[43:27] christian
[43:31] will betray you
[43:34] your true identity will be betrayed
[43:52] it can
[44:14] [Applause]
[44:37] [Music]
[44:48] manifest
[45:02] is time
[45:30] what do they require
[45:32] i'm asking you now
[45:34] what does the seed require to grow
[45:40] yes somebody come on in
[45:47] [Music]

[46:08] but it is it it is sunlight
[46:11] in secretary
[46:13] and rain water namaste water rain
[46:18] two things
[46:20] sun light um sonogram juba
[46:23] and rain nincuba and these are the same
[46:26] things everything innovating that the
[46:29] spiritual seeds also need to grow
[46:35] are you listening to me my name is are
[46:38] you listening to me church i'm pretty
[46:39] happy two things
[46:56] but in this case
[46:58] it is not sunlight but it is sunlight

[47:08] light it is s-o-n
[47:10] [Music]
[47:21] [Applause]
[47:23] him
[47:26] but when he came who was he he was the
[47:28] light of the world
[47:34] amen and then what else do we need
[47:50] they
[47:51] [Applause]
[48:07] [Music]
[48:35] yes so you know what i'm talking about
[48:38] that rain that comes in when you're just
[48:40] planting another train that comes in
[48:42] when you are about to invest
[48:53] [Music]
[49:00] deep some may not understand but you you
[49:03] bought it well now listen what did he
[49:05] say
[49:07] this is the most interesting part okay
[49:10] and i'm glad you're listening
[49:14] one thing that happens
[49:18] and then the holocaust
[49:21] but these seeds what were they in
[49:23] sequence you know that were planted in
[49:25] this field exactly
[49:28] the good
[50:05] [Applause]
[50:09] but in the same way
[50:11] [Applause]
[50:40] [Applause]
[50:52] just
[51:19] they may act the same way
[52:07] the pentecostal shout out
[52:13] speak in tongues
[52:14] we should shout and speak english
[52:20] [Music]
[52:58] and i would believe that when they are
[53:00] when the anointing comes
[53:04] more than men
[53:07] and so women even are better speakers
[53:12] do you know
[53:39] god does not take away the
[54:22] those things are good
[54:25] must be a part of the truth
[54:30] you cannot replace the word there is
[54:33] foreign
[54:49] we believe in the manifestation of that
[54:51] word
[54:53] you believe in that manifestation of the
[54:55] word now
[54:57] the same word
[54:59] but it would only provide the atmosphere
[55:03] why would i take away
[56:56] and i believe i was predestinated
[57:01] i'm sorry i can't speak for anyone here
[57:05] for myself
[57:08] if you can speak for yourself can you
[57:10] just speak it out
[57:35] [Applause]
[57:36] praise the name of the lord amen that's
[57:38] why we must
[58:20] no
[58:29] [Applause]
[58:32] amen only went and sold
[58:42] [Music]
[59:21] [Music]
[59:44] here
[59:48] [Music]
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:01:24] [Music]
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:49] no matter what
[1:02:31] amen it was a
[1:02:43] [Applause]
[1:03:56] where would
[1:04:09] you begin to manifest your true
[1:04:39] oh
[1:04:43] you cannot find peace in the things of
[1:04:45] the world
[1:04:48] amen why because your heart
[1:04:52] is
[1:05:06] if
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:20] because i'm not happy for the suffering
[1:05:22] i went through
[1:05:24] i believe that they would understand
[1:05:26] them come on acts together
[1:05:28] anymore
[1:05:32] even if the ship deserves to do that
[1:05:47] it is
[1:06:58] sister
[1:07:25] hallelujah amen now i want to read the
[1:07:28] quotes
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:30] from one message
[1:07:32] and i will actually finish with it
[1:07:35] uh that would be from the audition
[1:07:37] church agency
[1:07:42] the second thought that must be
[1:07:44] impressed on our hearts is the that the
[1:07:47] seven church edges started out with the
[1:07:49] antichrist spiritually
[1:08:08] it started
[1:08:15] as well as the holy spirit who is
[1:08:17] blessed
[1:08:18] who is to be blessed forever
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:36] spirits whether they are of god
[1:08:42] because many false prophets are going
[1:08:43] out into the world
[1:08:47] many false prophets
[1:08:49] what talk about that can't show any
[1:08:51] false prophets
[1:08:53] and sometimes you think that prophets
[1:08:54] are only preachers
[1:08:59] prophets false prophets are those with
[1:09:00] wrong spirits on them
[1:09:04] and we shall
[1:09:19] the ages came in with false prophets and
[1:09:22] they will go out with first prophets
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:26] now of course there is going to be a
[1:10:28] real false prophet
[1:10:35] one like this in the grand sense of the
[1:10:38] man mentioned in the revelations
[1:11:05] shall say unto you lord hear his christ
[1:11:07] so there believe it not for that shall
[1:11:09] arise for christ and false prophets and
[1:11:12] show signs great signs and wonders in so
[1:11:14] much that if it were possible they shall
[1:11:16] deceive their very elect
[1:11:34] by the way have you seen that some
[1:11:35] people preach that the bride the elect
[1:11:37] will be deceived
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:12:06] is
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:20] it is
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:23] jesus said if we are possible
[1:12:29] but i'm glad it is not possible
[1:12:34] oh my
[1:13:03] is in the second chambers believe it or
[1:13:04] not
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:12] you come and see the great prophets
[1:13:20] [Applause]
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:44] there we are false prophets also among
[1:13:47] the people
[1:13:50] even as there shall be frustrations
[1:13:52] among you
[1:13:57] meaning
[1:13:58] in the christian
[1:14:12] do you know why people follow them they
[1:14:13] don't need children
[1:14:15] people follow them because they have
[1:14:16] very big followings
[1:14:21] like this one
[1:14:22] because everybody's going there for me
[1:14:50] and
[1:14:51] in this
[1:14:52] there was one which had like one car
[1:15:08] which land should we go to get okay
[1:15:11] he said go to this one because it has
[1:15:12] many cars
[1:15:16] because it means that it is the one
[1:15:18] which is the worse
[1:15:21] so when we used it can we
[1:15:23] we got stuck there for a very long time
[1:15:28] and when we reached ahead we tried to
[1:15:29] commence we noticed there was many cars
[1:15:32] on that lane because
[1:15:33] the road was having a problem in front
[1:15:36] dragon the chisel
[1:16:03] my father's religion
[1:17:00] yeah but the children of god i never
[1:17:03] explained when you go through the narrow
[1:17:05] ways
[1:17:06] if you have a big head
[1:17:13] go through it
[1:17:14] it
[1:17:28] hallelujah
[1:17:29] [Music]
[1:17:42] then we continue here
[1:17:44] quickly with that quote i want to finish
[1:17:46] with that quote he says
[1:17:48] but there will be many false prophets
[1:17:53] he says among you
[1:17:56] who privily shall bring in damnable
[1:18:01] heresies
[1:18:08] even denying the lord that brought them
[1:18:11] and bring upon themselves with
[1:18:13] destruction
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:20] how will they deny the law
[1:18:23] they will refuse water baptism in the
[1:18:26] name of allah or jesus
[1:18:33] the other day i called i was with one of
[1:18:35] the young man he's coming to this church
[1:18:36] these days his name is joanne what
[1:20:01] i told him now read acts
[1:20:17] [Music]
[1:20:29] shall receive the gift of the
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:44] hallelujah i mean that's what the bible
[1:20:47] says
[1:20:50] but these false prophets
[1:20:53] are anointed
[1:20:55] but to tell lies
[1:21:25] that's a doctrine of
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:22:06] it's up to you to start will you stand
[1:22:07] with the word or you will
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:29] [Music]
