[8:52] Our father
[8:54] who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[8:58] Thy kingdom come, thine will be done on
[9:02] earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
[9:06] day our daily bread. Forgive us our
[9:09] trespasses, Lord, as we forgive those
[9:11] who trespass against us. Do not lead us
[9:14] into temptation, but deliver us from
[9:17] evil. For thine is the kingdom, the
[9:20] power, and the glory are yours now and
[9:23] forever. Kind loving heavenly father, we
[9:27] want to thank you for this wonderful
[9:29] moment that you have given us to be in
[9:31] your house. Lord, you said in your word
[9:35] that come unto me all year that labor
[9:37] and are heaven and I will give you rest.
[9:40] Father, it is in your word that you
[9:42] called us. Father, we have come in your
[9:45] presence. Lord, we are such a needy
[9:48] people, Lord. We need you, Father. We
[9:51] surrender our lives this morning. We
[9:53] surrender the word. We surrender the
[9:56] song leading. We surrender every
[9:58] activity that is going to be done in
[10:01] your sanctuary this morning. Father, may
[10:03] your presence come down. May you come
[10:06] and fill us, Lord. May you come and
[10:09] bring back the backsliders, Lord. May
[10:12] you come, King of glory, and strengthen
[10:14] the weak. Father, may you come and heal
[10:17] the sick. Father, may you come and bless
[10:21] your children. Lord, this is your house.
[10:24] It is a house of prayer. That's why,
[10:26] Father, we pray. May your praises rain
[10:30] down, Father, we dedicate you, our
[10:32] pastor, Lord, that as he's preparing
[10:35] himself to come and speak to your
[10:37] children, may you use him as a voice,
[10:39] King of glory, to speak unto the needs
[10:42] of your people. Father, may you use the
[10:45] song leader. May you use the musician,
[10:47] King of Glory. May you use each and
[10:50] every soul that is in this place for the
[10:52] glory of your name. Father, we even pray
[10:56] for them that are still on the way. May
[10:59] you fasten and quicken their footsteps,
[11:01] King of glory. Lord, we want also to
[11:03] remember those that will be streaming
[11:05] online. Father, may you bless every soul
[11:08] wherever they are. The Bible say that
[11:10] you sent your word and it healed us,
[11:12] Lord. May you heal the diseases of your
[11:15] people. May you heal the weaknesses,
[11:18] Lord. May you answer every prayer,
[11:21] Father. King of glory. Even all the
[11:23] saints around the world where they are
[11:25] gathering. Father, we commit them into
[11:27] your hands. May your will, Father, this
[11:30] morning be done in this sanctuary. And
[11:33] Father, may we leave this place when we
[11:36] are better citizens of your kingdom. We
[11:39] bless you. We give you praise. And
[11:41] devil, you have no right over the
[11:44] children of God. We render powerless
[11:47] every principality, every rulers of
[11:49] darkness in the heavenly place. We pray
[11:52] may the holy angels take their position
[11:54] and may the Holy Spirit come and lead
[11:59] every single activity that is going to
[12:02] be done in this place. We bless you
[12:05] Lord. We magnify you. We pray Lord for
[12:08] the tithers and offerings that your
[12:10] children are going to bring. Father,
[12:13] that is the only place where you said in
[12:15] your word that we should test you, that
[12:18] we will see how you'll open the
[12:19] floodgates of heaven. Father, bless
[12:22] every soul that is going to sow a seed
[12:24] of money, a seed of love that are going
[12:27] to give their tithes and offerings. King
[12:29] of glory, may they reap bountfully. We
[12:32] bless you, we honor you, and we magnify
[12:35] you. Thank you, King of Glory. In the
[12:38] name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we have
[12:40] prayed. Amen.

[1:06:35] and the Lord is good.
[1:06:38] So before we go to the word this
[1:06:39] morning, a few things I just wanted to
[1:06:40] say.
[1:06:43] First of all, we have an announcement
[1:06:44] here.
[1:06:46] You see that uh brother and his family
[1:06:49] are not here this morning.
[1:06:53] Um
[1:06:54] um they're announcing the the birth of
[1:06:57] their newborn.
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:04] And uh I love the way he
[1:07:07] he did it. Said brother, his name is
[1:07:10] brother Niah Lee
[1:07:19] and he was born yesterday 22nd
[1:07:23] and he was weighing 3.76 kg.
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:28] That's what you call a bouncing baby
[1:07:30] boy.
[1:07:34] you know, this uh baby was a bit a big
[1:07:38] size
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; and I'm just looking for something.
[1:07:43] uh you know we prayed and um you know
[1:07:46] they went to the hospital
[1:07:49] and uh they stayed there for quite a
[1:07:51] long time
[1:07:53] before they you know almost more than 24
[1:07:56] hours
[1:07:59] and so um given the circumstances
[1:08:03] the doctors uh suggested that they go
[1:08:06] ceserian
[1:08:09] but um you know we prayed and believed
[1:08:12] that God could make it go the other way.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Um but um the last words I spoke
[1:08:21] now when the the decision was made and
[1:08:24] you know they had to go ceserian
[1:08:28] um
[1:08:30] I I I I you know I was talking to
[1:08:34] you know they very secretive and
[1:08:39] never told us what type of baby they
[1:08:40] were bringing.
[1:08:43] But you see, as I was talking to him,
[1:08:46] I told him, "Do not worry. All shall be
[1:08:49] well
[1:08:51] with your wife and your boy." And I
[1:08:54] never knew he was going to have a boy.
[1:08:58] Well, he laughed. I told him, "Uh, well,
[1:09:02] what is funny?"
[1:09:05] Well, it it is now, now I understand
[1:09:09] they are going to have a baby boy.
[1:09:12] those words I now because after I said
[1:09:14] it I was like okay wait
[1:09:17] did I think about what I said
[1:09:21] I said well I never thought about it
[1:09:24] I told Isaac I'm sorry I know I'm not
[1:09:26] saying you're going to have a boy
[1:09:30] but but those words are not mine
[1:09:33] so so God had it in mind
[1:09:36] and indeed everything was well with the
[1:09:38] mother
[1:09:42] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:45] So they still in the hospital
[1:09:48] probably they'll be leaving today.
[1:09:52] Uh please send them a card. Send them
[1:09:54] something.
[1:10:00] Do you know
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; when somebody gives birth in a medicine,
[1:10:03] you should show them that there's
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; a preacher who said if you cannot
[1:10:07] convert people to from the world to God
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:13] if you can't go preach evangelize people
[1:10:15] to get saved. Give birth children to
[1:10:18] God. That way you can raise them in the
[1:10:20] fear of.
[1:10:24] So if somebody gives birth
[1:10:28] after marrying
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; it is good to send them gifts you know
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; and you rejoice with them. Amen. Amen.

[1:11:17] Would you also want to be back?" I would
[1:11:19] have wanted, but you are leaving.
[1:11:22] I said, "Well, we are still here."

[1:14:42] Let me read a portion of it
[1:14:45] for this interest of time. Just listen.
[1:14:48] Dear pastor, Christian, greetings uh in

[1:15:24] God to awaken the bride and usher in a
[1:15:27] deeper manifestation of his presence and
[1:15:29] power in this last day. As the prophet
[1:15:32] William Brham once declared, this is the
[1:15:34] hour when the message and the bride with
[1:15:36] when the message of the bridegroom and
[1:15:38] the bride is coming together. It is the
[1:15:40] evening time. It is the time of the
[1:15:42] restoration is a time of the calling out
[1:15:44] of the bride. So the convention program
[1:15:46] will future
[1:15:48] um worship and um and and you know
[1:15:51] anointed worship and uh led by
[1:15:53] consecrated music ministers and inspired
[1:15:56] preaching teaching by the Holy Ghost
[1:15:57] field ministers from across the country
[1:15:59] in intercessory prayer, deliverance,
[1:16:00] divine healing sessions and under the
[1:16:02] uncction of the Holy Spirit um uh every
[1:16:05] evening from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00. I think
[1:16:08] those um healing services will be in the
[1:16:11] evenings but uh they will have preaching
[1:16:13] services from the morning. I was told
[1:16:15] that and uh so we humbly request the
[1:16:18] participation of your church in this
[1:16:20] sacred convocation. Kindly notify us and
[1:16:22] and so the pastor inviting us John
[1:16:25] Pastor John Chak.
[1:16:28] Now I understand that now many of you
[1:16:30] are wondering well we also already have
[1:16:32] been invited
[1:16:36] to another convention
[1:16:40] which actually I have the invitation
[1:16:43] here as well
[1:16:46] from speechb ministries
[1:16:50] and we already read this to you on 27th
[1:16:51] of May
[1:16:56] but uh
[1:16:58] To me I I think this is a youth
[1:17:01] convention.
[1:17:05] This is everybody's convention
[1:17:08] and uh we as DVF work and cooperate with
[1:17:12] all these churches.
[1:17:16] So I'm requesting you as a church
[1:17:19] to support in both conventions
[1:17:24] and um and uh to also attend
[1:17:31] both conventions.
[1:17:33] Is it possible? Yes.
[1:17:36] Um from 4th to 7th.
[1:17:39] Now how many days are those?
[1:17:44] Three four days.
[1:17:46] Uh the one of speckled bad is from let
[1:17:49] me get a dates correct from 8th from 4th
[1:17:52] to 8th
[1:17:56] and so um um so you can decide to attend
[1:18:00] some days here and some days there
[1:18:05] but one thing I should also um emphasize
[1:18:11] we are going to have our Sunday morning
[1:18:13] service
[1:18:16] You as a a member here, your duty is at
[1:18:20] your church.
[1:18:26] when your church is open,
[1:18:28] you're not expected to be anywhere,
[1:18:31] but that's going to be only one Sunday
[1:18:32] morning service
[1:18:35] and then all these other um you know uh
[1:18:40] days.
[1:18:42] We will not have any church program
[1:18:46] just go and fully participate in this
[1:18:47] congregation
[1:18:50] except for Sunday morning.
[1:18:52] So both uh conventions, both churches
[1:18:55] have invited us
[1:18:57] and we want to participate in both.
[1:19:00] Is that amen?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh both of them are my friends
[1:19:08] and um we they also always participate
[1:19:11] in all our meetings.
[1:19:15] So we should also do the same.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Sister Mary be here and be there.
[1:19:23] a service here and a service there.
[1:19:27] I think we we should rejoice at the
[1:19:29] abundance of the blessings for that
[1:19:30] weekend.
[1:19:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. And
[1:19:37] unfortunately, I'm not going to be
[1:19:38] around that weekend.
[1:19:42] I'm going to be in Ethiopia.
[1:19:44] As I already told you, I think a few
[1:19:46] weeks ago,
[1:19:49] um we I'm going to be taking a mission
[1:19:51] in into the northern parts of Ethiopia
[1:19:55] and then we have a convention and a
[1:19:57] minister's meeting in the southern part
[1:20:03] some meetings in the city.
[1:20:06] Um um personally I will not be around
[1:20:09] that weekend
[1:20:12] but Jesus Christ will be with us.
[1:20:15] I also heard brother Kagan being
[1:20:17] mentioned of you. God bless you.
[1:20:20] Your friend Polycap has talked much
[1:20:23] about you.

[1:20:26] morning. So before we go to the word
[1:20:30] once again, I'd like to sing with my

[1:45:42] than usual,
[1:45:44] you don't feel it.
[1:45:47] How many have ever felt that? You can be
[1:45:50] in church and they tell you he preached
[1:45:52] for 12 hours. Why?
[1:45:54] I thought it was 30 minutes. That's what
[1:45:57] his presence does.
[1:45:59] You lose track on time.
[1:46:01] So may God help help all of us this
[1:46:03] morning. Genesis 39
[1:46:07] And we are reading five verses.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; And Joseph was brought down to Egypt.
[1:46:13] And Portifer, an officer of Pharaoh,
[1:46:16] captain of the God, an Egyptian, bought
[1:46:18] bought him of the hands of the
[1:46:20] Ishalites, which had brought him down
[1:46:23] thther. And the Lord was with Joseph,
[1:46:25] and he was a a prosperous man, and he
[1:46:27] was in the house of his master, the
[1:46:29] Egyptian. and his uh master saw that the
[1:46:32] Lord was with him and that the Lord made
[1:46:35] all that he did to prosper in his hand.
[1:46:38] And Joseph found grace in his sight and
[1:46:41] he served him and he made him overseer
[1:46:44] over his house and all that he had put
[1:46:46] in his and all that he had he put in his
[1:46:50] hand. And it came to pass from the time
[1:46:53] that he had made him overseer in his
[1:46:55] house and over all that he had that the
[1:46:57] Lord blessed the Egyptians house for
[1:46:59] Joseph's sake. And the blessing of the
[1:47:01] Lord was upon all that he had in the
[1:47:05] house and in the field. And he left all
[1:47:07] that he had in Joseph's hand. And he
[1:47:09] knew not all he had save the bread which
[1:47:13] he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly
[1:47:16] person and well favored.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; You can read it now.
[1:47:30] Fore!
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:42] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:48:01] Foreign
[1:48:08] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[1:48:36] Amen. Amen. You may be seated, please.
[1:48:40] Tell your neighbor, son of prosperity.
[1:48:46] Um
[1:48:48] uh please do not move around.
[1:48:53] Try to stay in in in the place where you
[1:48:55] are
[1:48:57] as much as you possibly can.
[1:49:00] And um so this morning I'm speaking on
[1:49:03] son of prosperity
[1:49:06] and I'm going to go a little fast so
[1:49:09] that we can be able to uh not take a
[1:49:12] very long time.
[1:49:14] So you have to be attentive so you can
[1:49:16] follow what I'm saying.
[1:49:19] Brother Emmanuel um sent greetings to
[1:49:22] you.
[1:49:24] He's constrained with something and he's
[1:49:25] not able to be here
[1:49:28] but I think his wife is here somewhere
[1:49:32] over here.
[1:49:34] All right. So we're speaking on son of
[1:49:35] prosperity.
[1:49:37] Now when we talk about prosperity
[1:49:40] um it's been the way it has been
[1:49:42] presented in our generation
[1:49:46] has has been in a different way.
[1:49:49] It has been a different thing whereby
[1:49:52] you find people coming to church to seek
[1:49:54] for prosperity but because they do not
[1:49:57] understand
[1:49:59] that the prosperity that God gives
[1:50:02] is different
[1:50:04] you know it has different principles.
[1:50:08] The world can make you accumulate wealth
[1:50:13] but when you are not prosperous.
[1:50:16] So true prosperity is not the
[1:50:18] accumulation of wealth.
[1:50:21] True prosperity
[1:50:23] is actually advancing,
[1:50:28] pushing forward.
[1:50:30] I show I told you that it it comes from
[1:50:32] the word salak
[1:50:34] in Hebrew, ancient Hebrew
[1:50:37] which means to make progress,
[1:50:40] to succeed,
[1:50:42] to advance,
[1:50:44] to prosper.
[1:50:46] Now not in some things but in all
[1:50:50] things.
[1:50:51] Often times in our generation we have
[1:50:53] many people who are wealthy
[1:50:57] but they are not advancing.
[1:51:00] They are not happy. You know because the
[1:51:03] the way they attain their wealth
[1:51:07] you know was not from the prosperity
[1:51:09] that comes from God.
[1:51:12] So you might be wealthy and still not
[1:51:15] prosperous
[1:51:17] and you might be not with a lot of
[1:51:19] wealth
[1:51:21] but yet you are prosperous.
[1:51:23] But when you receive this kind of
[1:51:25] prosperity,
[1:51:27] you actually move forward in everything
[1:51:29] that you do.
[1:51:33] The spirit of stagnation
[1:51:36] cannot be where the son of prosperity
[1:51:39] is.
[1:51:41] The son of prosperity before I even
[1:51:44] continue I will tell you is Jesus
[1:51:46] Christ.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the son of prosperity.
[1:51:51] He is the word. But the reason why we
[1:51:54] read it out here
[1:51:56] in in in in Genesis 39
[1:52:00] is because we see the story of Joseph.
[1:52:03] Joseph was a type of Christ.
[1:52:07] And I will do a lot of quoting here and
[1:52:08] there.
[1:52:10] you just follow along. And Joseph was a
[1:52:13] type of Christ,
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; you know. And brother Bam here says,
[1:52:18] "I've hollered at you, you women.
[1:52:21] I've hollered at you."
[1:52:24] Now, of course, in many of his sermons,
[1:52:26] he always talks about women dressing
[1:52:27] this way, women doing that, women.
[1:52:31] But then he says, "Now I'm going to take
[1:52:32] up for you.
[1:52:35] The woman is the weaker vessel." Yes,
[1:52:38] I know there can't be a bad man before
[1:52:40] there is a bad woman.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; But men who knows that men who knows
[1:52:48] that you are a son of God.
[1:52:53] Praise the name of the Lord. Men that
[1:52:55] who know that you a son of God
[1:52:59] and take advantage of a woman,
[1:53:04] shame on you. Do I have sons of God
[1:53:06] here?
[1:53:08] If you are a son of God and you take
[1:53:11] advantage of a woman,
[1:53:14] shame on you, no matter what she does.
[1:53:19] That's why we don't believe in slapping
[1:53:22] women.
[1:53:25] Men, sons of God, believers, we do not
[1:53:27] beat our wives.
[1:53:31] We don't brothers. Say, "Amen.
[1:53:35] We don't beat our wives. We don't
[1:53:38] mistreat our women. We treat them with
[1:53:41] honor. We treat them with love as weak
[1:53:44] vessels knowing they are precious in the
[1:53:47] sight of God.
[1:53:50] Amen. No matter what she does, she's a
[1:53:53] weaker vessel. And you know that if she
[1:53:57] goes out acting unladylike,
[1:54:03] take her by the hand and talk to her
[1:54:06] like a sister.
[1:54:09] You are a son of God.
[1:54:11] Don't do them evil things.
[1:54:15] Look at Joseph. He was an example to
[1:54:18] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Joseph was an example when Portifer's
[1:54:24] wife
[1:54:25] This beautiful woman,
[1:54:27] honorable,
[1:54:29] highest, one of the highest women
[1:54:32] there was in the country, begged him and
[1:54:35] persuaded him.
[1:54:38] and he turned and she caught him
[1:54:42] and tried to hug him
[1:54:46] and he jacked
[1:54:48] till he even pulled his cord
[1:54:51] and he ran from her.
[1:54:54] Yes sir. And when he come in, they told
[1:54:57] a lie on him
[1:55:01] said he come in to ravish her
[1:55:06] and he left his god.
[1:55:08] And for that he went to the dungeon.
[1:55:12] But in the dungeon,
[1:55:15] God was with him.
[1:55:18] No matter where they put him,
[1:55:21] there is something about somebody
[1:55:24] who has the son of prosperity.
[1:55:29] When prosperity is with you,
[1:55:32] no matter where you go,
[1:55:34] God will always be with you.
[1:55:38] Amen. And Joseph being a type of a son
[1:55:42] of prosperity.
[1:55:44] The Bible says everything he did,
[1:55:48] it prospered.
[1:55:50] Amen.
[1:55:51] Joseph prospered when he was with his
[1:55:54] people. Joseph prospered when he was in
[1:55:58] the danger. Joseph prospered when he was
[1:56:01] with the Egyptian. Joseph prospered when
[1:56:04] he was with a barbarian.
[1:56:06] Joseph prospered when he was in the hand
[1:56:09] of in the house of
[1:56:11] Joseph prospered when he was accused
[1:56:14] falsely.
[1:56:15] Joseph prospered when he was thrown into
[1:56:18] prison. Joseph prospered everywhere he
[1:56:22] went. Everything he had
[1:56:26] it prospered.
[1:56:28] Prosperity means to go forward to
[1:56:32] succeed.
[1:56:33] Amen.
[1:56:35] have succeeded
[1:56:38] meaning you there is no failure
[1:56:41] in prosperity.
[1:56:44] Hallelujah.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; He was a type of the son of prosperity.
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:52] Everything Joseph done
[1:56:55] prospered. And when Jesus returns in the
[1:56:57] millennium,
[1:57:00] that's the reason the deserts will
[1:57:02] blossom.
[1:57:07] as a rose.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. God bless you, Sister
[1:57:13] Rose.
[1:57:14] The deserts will blossom
[1:57:18] as a rose.
[1:57:20] Everything he does will prosper. He's
[1:57:24] talking about Jesus when he comes back
[1:57:26] again. Amen. Everything will prosper.
[1:57:31] Here is the son. Why? because he's the
[1:57:33] son of prosperity.
[1:57:36] Everything that Jesus does prosper
[1:57:41] when he comes back to the earth,
[1:57:45] there will be no sin.
[1:57:49] And when Jesus returns, everything will
[1:57:52] prosper. He's the son of prosperity.
[1:57:55] Wherever you put Joseph,
[1:57:58] it was blessed. Wherever Jesus is, it is
[1:58:02] blessed. So get him in your heart
[1:58:06] and be blessed. When you receive the
[1:58:09] oil,
[1:58:10] when you receive the spirit, when you
[1:58:13] receive the word in your heart, you will
[1:58:17] be blessed.
[1:58:18] You will be a blessing.
[1:58:21] Everywhere you go, there will be a
[1:58:24] stump.
[1:58:26] So and so was here.
[1:58:28] I don't know about you, but when I was
[1:58:31] reading about Joseph,
[1:58:33] I felt like I was reading about me.
[1:58:38] Wherever you go, there will be
[1:58:41] blossoming.
[1:58:43] You will succeed.
[1:58:45] Am I preaching to someone this morning?
[1:58:48] You will advance.
[1:58:50] You will make progress.
[1:58:52] Maybe you are here this morning and you
[1:58:55] feel you are stagnant.
[1:58:59] And some people think to be a believer
[1:59:03] is to be humble poor and sorry
[1:59:07] no
[1:59:08] I don't want to pity you if you feel you
[1:59:12] are poor you are humble and you feel
[1:59:16] sorry I am here to remind you that you
[1:59:19] lost your way
[1:59:24] a son a daughter of God
[1:59:27] Even when you have no money in your
[1:59:29] pocket, you will know I am not poor.
[1:59:33] I am not poor.
[1:59:36] But in our generation, in the book, I
[1:59:39] will get there. In the book of
[1:59:40] Revelation, he it says that they say,
[1:59:44] they are rich, increase with good, have
[1:59:48] need of nothing. Meaning they have
[1:59:50] everything they need. Amen. But he says
[1:59:55] they are wretched. They are poor. They
[1:59:58] are naked. They don't know.
[2:00:03] But here in this church, we have people
[2:00:07] who are rich, who are succeeding, who
[2:00:10] are advancing, who are pushing forward,
[2:00:13] but they don't know. I have come to tell
[2:00:16] you, you are not poor.
[2:00:19] You are succeeding.
[2:00:22] Stop saying my business is failing. You
[2:00:26] just created failure.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Believers, we must know what we are made
[2:00:34] of.
[2:00:37] We must know who we are. When you know
[2:00:40] who you are, no amount of darkness,
[2:00:44] no amount of misfortune
[2:00:47] can discourage you
[2:00:49] to begin confessing negative
[2:00:53] about yourself. Even when you are sick,
[2:00:56] you begin, you have to begin by
[2:00:59] confession.
[2:01:01] Everything begins by confession
[2:01:04] and then action.
[2:01:06] Today, if you give me time, I'm going to
[2:01:09] give you a principle
[2:01:11] which will help you in your walk on this
[2:01:15] earth. Even when you are sick, it begins
[2:01:19] with confession.
[2:01:20] I am healed. I am not sick. I am healed.
[2:01:25] Not because you are not feeling the
[2:01:27] symptoms.
[2:01:30] No matter what a doctor say,
[2:01:33] what does God say?
[2:01:36] God says something else.
[2:01:38] What God says
[2:01:41] is true and is faithful.
[2:01:44] What they say is not true. What you feel
[2:01:50] is not true.
[2:01:52] What God say
[2:01:54] cannot be felt many times.
[2:01:59] Cannot be seen many times.
[2:02:02] Cannot be heard many times.
[2:02:05] cannot be tested many times. Why?
[2:02:09] Because that's in the realm of human
[2:02:11] flesh.
[2:02:14] The things you can taste,
[2:02:16] feel, see, touch, hear and not real.
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:26] Amen.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Can you show me a soul?
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Do you feel a soul?
[2:02:34] Do you hear a soul?
[2:02:37] Can you touch it?
[2:02:39] Do you have a soul
[2:02:44] that is real?
[2:02:46] You can see it. You can touch it. You
[2:02:48] can feel it. You can't hear it. But you
[2:02:51] know I am a soul. So you believe it.
[2:02:56] Everything that is real,
[2:02:58] you only believe it.
[2:03:02] That's why the Bible says without faith
[2:03:06] it is impossible
[2:03:08] to please God.
[2:03:10] [Music]
[2:03:12] Now let's continue before you get tired.
[2:03:15] I want to get continue this
[2:03:18] in the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's
[2:03:19] visitation to Daniel. He says here you
[2:03:21] women I think I read that quote didn't
[2:03:23] I?
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; I did for sure. So now I want to show
[2:03:26] you Jesus is the word.
[2:03:29] Now wherever the word is
[2:03:32] that place is blessed.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the type Joseph was a type of
[2:03:38] the son of prosperity.
[2:03:40] Now when you receive the word
[2:03:44] who is now the son of prosperity
[2:03:47] and you leave it
[2:03:49] and just watch and see
[2:03:53] God will prosper.
[2:03:57] Amen.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Brethren, there is something about
[2:04:01] receiving the word,
[2:04:05] about believing the word.
[2:04:07] We have so many Christians
[2:04:10] who are in churches, but they don't
[2:04:13] believe the word.
[2:04:15] The word is not a dogma.
[2:04:17] The word is not a church creed.
[2:04:21] The word is not what somebody say.
[2:04:24] The word is what the Bible say.
[2:04:28] If it's not the word,
[2:04:31] walk away from it.
[2:04:34] And if you believe the word, if you do
[2:04:37] what the word say,
[2:04:40] listen church, you will always prosper.
[2:04:46] Everything you touch
[2:04:48] will prosper.
[2:04:50] That is what we call walking in power,
[2:04:54] walking in authority.
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:04:58] Why? Because you have the son of God.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. The revelation of Jesus
[2:05:08] Christ,
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to quote out of that. I say,
[2:05:11] Joseph loved by his father,
[2:05:15] but hated by his brother.
[2:05:20] When Joseph was very young,
[2:05:25] he was hated by his brethren.
[2:05:28] Why was he hated by his brethren?
[2:05:31] It was because he was spiritual.
[2:05:34] He couldn't help seeing those visions.
[2:05:37] Nor could he help dreaming dreams and
[2:05:39] interpreting
[2:05:42] that was in him.
[2:05:46] Amen.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; We shall see it later. Whatever you need
[2:05:50] to prosper
[2:05:52] when you receive the word, you receive
[2:05:54] the Holy Ghost is in you.
[2:05:59] What do you want?
[2:06:01] Not even need.
[2:06:05] Oh my. Oh my.
[2:06:09] Keep pulling
[2:06:11] whatever you want.
[2:06:14] It even goes from want. It goes from
[2:06:16] need to want. It goes to some other
[2:06:19] level
[2:06:20] desire.
[2:06:21] [Music]
[2:06:25] Whatsoever you desire,
[2:06:29] I'm not talking about anyone.
[2:06:32] I'm talking about children of God who
[2:06:35] have believed the word and have received
[2:06:37] the Holy Ghost.
[2:06:39] Now, whatever you desire,
[2:06:43] you shall have it. That's not my word.
[2:06:47] That's what the Bible say. He says
[2:06:50] whatsoever things you desire.
[2:06:54] Not some everything meaning amen the
[2:06:59] power or the the money to purchase it
[2:07:02] is in desire
[2:07:07] that if you if you desire it,
[2:07:10] it means there is a deep somewhere to
[2:07:12] respond.
[2:07:15] [Applause]
[2:07:17] You do not have to live below your
[2:07:18] privileges.
[2:07:21] What do you desire? Whatsoever you think
[2:07:24] you desire, if you pray and believe, he
[2:07:28] says, you shall have it.
[2:07:31] Why? Because whatsoever you need
[2:07:35] is in you.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; I wish I can bring it better than that.
[2:07:43] When God, oh, let me bring it this way.
[2:07:46] When God wants to give you something,
[2:07:51] you will know
[2:07:53] how he puts a desire in there.
[2:07:57] [Applause]
[2:08:02] The thing I'm preaching today, if you
[2:08:04] follow me closely, it will help you in
[2:08:06] your personal life and it will help us
[2:08:09] as a church.
[2:08:11] Right now we are desiring a church life.
[2:08:15] Me as a person I'm desiring.
[2:08:18] How many are desiring?
[2:08:21] Okay. I you as an individual you desire
[2:08:25] many things some of you do you know that
[2:08:28] if I call three of you here
[2:08:31] you have different desire
[2:08:34] because God doesn't want to give us
[2:08:37] everything.
[2:08:39] Some of you are desiring 100 million.
[2:08:42] to do a certain project.
[2:08:44] But someone when he hears your desire,
[2:08:49] may I just desire 5 million.
[2:08:53] Why? Because your desire is placed there
[2:08:57] by the Holy Spirit
[2:08:59] because he knows he has already
[2:09:02] provided.
[2:09:05] If you desire something, it means the
[2:09:09] provision has already been unleashed.
[2:09:15] It is somewhere. The only thing you
[2:09:17] need. Amen. That's what I'm preaching
[2:09:20] about. The only thing you need is to go
[2:09:23] get it. But how do you get today? I want
[2:09:28] to show you that.
[2:09:31] If you follow me well, you will see how
[2:09:34] you get. But if you have a desire, even
[2:09:37] when you're praying or fasting for
[2:09:39] something, you need something you want.
[2:09:43] That's even why brother said if you're
[2:09:46] praying for some important thing.
[2:09:50] Don't wait, how do you know it is the
[2:09:52] will of God?
[2:09:54] Don't wait for a vision
[2:09:57] or a dream or whatever it is. If God
[2:10:00] deals with you that way,
[2:10:02] that's okay. But you don't have to wait
[2:10:06] for a prophecy dream of you.
[2:10:09] What God will do, you will put a desire
[2:10:11] in.
[2:10:14] He will bind you with that thing that
[2:10:16] you desire.
[2:10:19] You can't get your mind off of it. You
[2:10:22] can't get your heart off of it.
[2:10:24] And you are leaning towards
[2:10:28] then he says, "Go that direction.
[2:10:30] Take that direction
[2:10:33] of your desire. If you are wrong, then
[2:10:37] the Holy Spirit will correct you.
[2:10:41] If the mother is in prayer,
[2:10:44] he will make sure you do not go wrong.
[2:10:49] Are you not so glad we are babies in his
[2:10:54] will make sure we do not go wrong?
[2:10:59] He will lead us. He will guide us.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. He will give us
[2:11:05] everything.
[2:11:10] Hallelujah.
[2:11:12] Amen.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; The reason why I'm happy, I feel
[2:11:18] he has already provided
[2:11:21] everything you desire.
[2:11:23] God cannot inspire
[2:11:26] a preacher to preach something.
[2:11:29] If he's not planning to do it.
[2:11:32] Hallelujah. When a preacher is inspired
[2:11:37] with trials and suffering,
[2:11:40] get ready
[2:11:42] as a church. You are going to go through
[2:11:44] trials and
[2:11:46] today he has inspired me to preach about
[2:11:50] your desire.
[2:11:52] That means we should get ready. We
[2:11:55] should get ready because whatever God
[2:11:58] inspired
[2:12:00] to bring your way
[2:12:03] is only because he's planning to fulfill
[2:12:05] it in your life.
[2:12:11] Amen. Amen. All right. Listen.
[2:12:14] Therefore, where was I even?
[2:12:18] Praise the Lord.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; He couldn't help seeing those visions.
[2:12:23] Therefore his brothers hated him.
[2:12:26] It was without cause but he was the
[2:12:28] beloved of his father.
[2:12:31] His father was a prophet and he
[2:12:33] understood
[2:12:35] that was a perfect type of Christ.
[2:12:38] God the father loved the son.
[2:12:41] But the brethren,
[2:12:43] the scribes
[2:12:45] and the Pharisees
[2:12:47] hated him.
[2:12:50] You see how Joseph is a type of Christ.
[2:12:52] His
[2:12:54] father loved him but his brother hated
[2:12:56] him. Jesus the real son of prosperity.
[2:13:02] His father loved him. The beloved of the
[2:13:06] father.
[2:13:09] But the brothers, the scribes and the
[2:13:12] Pharisees
[2:13:14] today they are the denominations of
[2:13:17] they hate him.
[2:13:22] because he could heal the sick.
[2:13:24] He could do miracles for a turn the
[2:13:27] future, see vision, interpret them. That
[2:13:32] was no reason to hate him.
[2:13:35] But they did. Unlike Joseph's brethren,
[2:13:39] they hated him without a cause.
[2:13:43] Okay. Now, let's go to the second phase
[2:13:45] of of Joseph here.
[2:13:48] I'm quoting from the angel of the Lord.
[2:13:50] Joseph, one of the patriots,
[2:13:53] sold down into Egypt,
[2:13:55] perfect type of Christ,
[2:13:57] betrayed by his brethren,
[2:14:00] sold for a few pieces of
[2:14:05] actually I was checking. He was sold for
[2:14:07] 20 pieces of silver
[2:14:11] at that time. This was the amount of
[2:14:14] money
[2:14:15] that you would buy a young slave.
[2:14:20] Joseph was a young man and therefore he
[2:14:23] was bought for the smallest amount.
[2:14:28] Despised,
[2:14:29] ridiculed,
[2:14:31] good for nothing.
[2:14:33] That's how he was seen by his brethren.
[2:14:39] Jesus when he come on the scene, that's
[2:14:42] how he was seen too.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Judas his very own.
[2:14:49] went to the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[2:14:53] his brethren
[2:14:55] told him I can give him to you just the
[2:14:58] way they saw Joseph
[2:15:02] I can give him
[2:15:05] what will I receive in return they gave
[2:15:07] him 30 pieces of
[2:15:10] the smallest amount of money
[2:15:14] you can buy an adult slave
[2:15:19] You know slaves also had categories.
[2:15:22] They were those who were considered
[2:15:24] better.
[2:15:26] Maybe they can work better
[2:15:29] or or they can there other weird things
[2:15:31] they used to do with than for slaves.
[2:15:35] And so they if they figured out that
[2:15:38] this breed is better
[2:15:41] so they would pay more for it.
[2:15:43] But Jesus, he was considered good for
[2:15:47] nothing.
[2:15:50] 30 pieces of silver
[2:15:53] just like Joseph,
[2:15:55] he wore a coat of many colors.
[2:15:58] That's Joseph as a Christ
[2:16:04] in Revelation 10
[2:16:07] sitting on a throne in Revelation 1
[2:16:11] and you know with a rainbow over him.
[2:16:15] There is seven perfect colors
[2:16:20] representing seven church ages.
[2:16:24] Rainbow representing a covenant.
[2:16:28] He was to look upon as a jasper and sad
[2:16:32] sad stone
[2:16:36] which was the raen and Benjamin
[2:16:42] which is actually the first and the
[2:16:43] last.
[2:16:47] He that was and he that is and he that
[2:16:52] shall come the root
[2:16:55] and offspring of David.
[2:16:58] the bright and morning star.
[2:17:02] Oh, how marvelous.
[2:17:04] And with a covenant to his churches,
[2:17:08] seven golden candlesticks
[2:17:12] behind him. Each candlestick
[2:17:14] representing a church age.
[2:17:17] If you read in the book of revelation,
[2:17:18] you can see this.
[2:17:20] So Jesus, he was the angel of the
[2:17:24] covenant.
[2:17:27] with those colors
[2:17:31] called of many colors.
[2:17:34] That's like what Joseph
[2:17:37] Joseph in prison
[2:17:40] Jesus on the cross.
[2:17:43] Two prisoners,
[2:17:44] one is condemned,
[2:17:46] one is set free. Joseph, you know
[2:17:50] something we see with Jesus.
[2:17:53] Let us read it now back in the
[2:17:55] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:58] Let us examine the life of Joseph
[2:18:00] where he was in Egypt. For it is here we
[2:18:04] see him as the perfect type of Christ
[2:18:09] while in the house of the general.
[2:18:12] He was falsely accused.
[2:18:17] He was banished and imprisoned
[2:18:20] without a cause.
[2:18:22] Just like they did to Jesus.
[2:18:25] Are you enjoying this church?
[2:18:28] They in prison. He interpreted the dream
[2:18:32] of the battler and the beggar
[2:18:36] who were also prisoners with him.
[2:18:41] The battler was restored to life.
[2:18:45] But the other was condemned to death.
[2:18:49] Listen church. Christ was imprisoned on
[2:18:53] the cross
[2:18:56] just like Joseph
[2:18:59] forsaken by God,
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; forsaken by man on either side
[2:19:06] was a thief.
[2:19:10] One died,
[2:19:12] but the other was granted life.
[2:19:16] How many remember that
[2:19:18] the Bible is in symbols?
[2:19:22] The Old Testament
[2:19:24] is a shadow of the New Testament.
[2:19:29] We can actually preach Jesus reading in
[2:19:31] the life of Jesus.
[2:19:35] And notice when Jesus was taken off the
[2:19:37] cross,
[2:19:39] he was exalted into heaven.
[2:19:42] And now, oh my, my I love this one. He
[2:19:45] sits at the right hand
[2:19:48] over the west spirit of Jehovah.
[2:19:52] Oh, hallelujah. When Joseph was taken
[2:19:55] out of jail,
[2:19:57] he never came out of jail
[2:20:00] as somebody that was defeated.
[2:20:04] Joseph came out of jail
[2:20:07] to become a prince in Egypt.
[2:20:11] Joseph came out of jail
[2:20:14] and he was on the right hand
[2:20:17] of the king.
[2:20:19] You could not come to the king
[2:20:22] only through Joseph.
[2:20:25] If you wanted to talk to the king,
[2:20:29] please can you bypass
[2:20:32] Joseph? If you don't go through Joseph,
[2:20:36] you could not see the king because the
[2:20:39] Joseph had come out of prison.
[2:20:43] Why? Because Joseph had been vindicated
[2:20:48] that there was indeed something in him
[2:20:52] even if he was
[2:20:55] nothing. And he went to jail. He went to
[2:20:59] prison as a nothing slave.
[2:21:03] But in in prison he proved he is worth
[2:21:06] what
[2:21:08] in prison he proved he was more than a
[2:21:11] slave.
[2:21:13] In prison Joseph showed he was typing
[2:21:17] something greater.
[2:21:21] He showed he was greater than they knew.
[2:21:26] What was he? He was next to the king.
[2:21:33] Who could tell?
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Greater than even
[2:21:39] Portifer.
[2:21:44] Greater than they knew.
[2:21:47] Greater than anybody suspected.
[2:21:50] That's who Joseph was.
[2:21:53] Jesus when he came and they condemned
[2:21:56] him. You know he had done nothing but
[2:21:59] they thought he was good for nothing
[2:22:02] and they condemned him to death.
[2:22:05] Who condemned him?
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Pontius pirate spir
[2:22:15] you people you're not receiving
[2:22:16] revelation.
[2:22:17] Are you getting it or you not?
[2:22:21] Oh sister, I'm happy to see you. But
[2:22:25] condemned him to prison.
[2:22:28] Oh my condemned him to the cross. And
[2:22:33] Jesus when he went on the cross and then
[2:22:36] went down into prison,
[2:22:38] in jail, in hell. They thought they were
[2:22:42] done with it. But you know what? who
[2:22:46] betrayed. You know the woman, the wife
[2:22:48] of Bifa
[2:22:50] is the one who actually lied against
[2:22:52] him.
[2:22:55] Lied against him.
[2:22:59] And then he was taken into the deepest
[2:23:03] in jail. But they did not know there was
[2:23:07] something greater
[2:23:09] in Joseph. There was something that no
[2:23:12] man could be able to take out.
[2:23:16] God is God no matter where it is.
[2:23:20] Hallelujah.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; You are who you are no matter which
[2:23:23] condition you are in.
[2:23:26] Never allow your condition
[2:23:29] to dictate your identity.
[2:23:32] Your condition
[2:23:34] does not in any way
[2:23:38] talk about who you are.
[2:23:41] Who you are is defined
[2:23:45] by the deepest.
[2:23:47] The people that has been blessed in you
[2:23:53] by the word of God.
[2:23:56] Who Joseph was
[2:23:59] the ticket
[2:24:01] that took him out of the prison.
[2:24:04] And when he left the prison, how do you
[2:24:07] think Portiv's wife looked at him
[2:24:10] next to Pharaoh
[2:24:14] in high places?
[2:24:16] No longer in the places low, but in high
[2:24:19] places. But he will tell you this, even
[2:24:22] before Joseph went into high places,
[2:24:26] he was in high places.
[2:24:28] Hallelujah. And Joseph treated himself
[2:24:33] as a man who knew who he was.
[2:24:36] He never allowed
[2:24:38] situation to dictate how he behaved.
[2:24:43] [Music]
[2:24:44] Some of you something wrong happens in
[2:24:46] your life.
[2:24:48] And then you begin having an attitude
[2:24:52] with everybody. Me, I was not there when
[2:24:54] that thing happened.
[2:24:56] So come on, smile. Don't show me
[2:24:58] attitude.
[2:25:02] Don't allow situation
[2:25:04] to determine your attitude.
[2:25:08] You are a Christian.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Some of you have forgotten. Let me
[2:25:12] remind you, you are a son of God. You
[2:25:15] are a daughter of God. Do not allow
[2:25:19] situations to determine your attitude.
[2:25:24] Your mental attitude
[2:25:27] towards every word of God
[2:25:34] will bring it to pass.
[2:25:39] [Applause]
[2:25:41] You got it.
[2:25:44] The way you think
[2:25:46] towards the word of God, towards the
[2:25:49] promises of God.
[2:25:51] It will be the one to decide whether it
[2:25:53] will come to pass.
[2:25:55] When you say yes, I am more than a
[2:25:58] conqueror. I am not in hell. I am in
[2:26:01] heavenly blessing
[2:26:04] with Christ Jesus. No matter what I'm
[2:26:07] going through,
[2:26:09] prosperity
[2:26:10] is in me. I am rich.
[2:26:14] I am rich. I am well. I am powerful. I
[2:26:19] am moving on. I am progressing. I am
[2:26:22] succeeding. You know when you say these
[2:26:24] things they you know in in the in the
[2:26:27] realm of the spirit.
[2:26:30] There will be the spirit of God to
[2:26:32] enforce it.
[2:26:36] [Applause]
[2:26:38] Listen, we are still talking about
[2:26:41] Joseph. So Joseph was but when he left
[2:26:45] the prison he did not leave the prison
[2:26:48] as a prisoner.
[2:26:51] Hallelujah.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to hell the prison of
[2:26:55] hell
[2:26:58] the prison of the cross he never left as
[2:27:01] a prisoner.
[2:27:04] When he left
[2:27:06] he never left as a prisoner. He never
[2:27:09] left as a condemned.
[2:27:12] left as a mighty conqueror.
[2:27:16] He had come on the cross
[2:27:18] so that it can be seen in his track
[2:27:22] record
[2:27:26] that he also conquered the cross.
[2:27:31] Hallelujah. so that those who follow him
[2:27:34] can say death where is your victory
[2:27:41] now we don't fear death because our
[2:27:45] mighty
[2:27:46] conqueror
[2:27:49] conquered death
[2:27:51] hallelujah so Jesus in his
[2:27:57] you know when you have a bigger CV
[2:28:01] no No one can doubt your tracker record
[2:28:06] in his CV.
[2:28:08] He also had it that he had conquered the
[2:28:11] cross
[2:28:13] and then from the cross. He said I
[2:28:16] finished that one. Now he said it is
[2:28:19] finished. It is finished. This part is
[2:28:22] finished. Some of you have finished some
[2:28:26] part
[2:28:28] of a trial and you are going to the next
[2:28:31] level.
[2:28:35] Hallelujah.
[2:28:37] Hallelujah. He said it's finished now.
[2:28:40] Satan bring more.
[2:28:44] And the devil thought he will come to
[2:28:46] hell and I'll finish him. I can finish
[2:28:50] all the others. But the moment he
[2:28:52] dropped into the prison of hell
[2:28:55] and he said, "Well, I've not come here
[2:28:58] to be defeated, but I've come here
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; to conquer."
[2:29:04] Hallelujah.
[2:29:07] Let me ask you a question. If you are in
[2:29:10] a certain kind of hell,
[2:29:13] what is your attitude?
[2:29:17] What is your attitude?
[2:29:20] You are in a hell where your business is
[2:29:23] going into tatters
[2:29:25] where you have a lot of debts.
[2:29:28] Maybe you are in a hell where you have
[2:29:30] failed to get a husband. You have failed
[2:29:32] to get a wife. You are confused. You
[2:29:36] have no money. You have no school fees
[2:29:38] for your children. You have no money to
[2:29:40] eat at home. You are confused.
[2:29:44] And I prophesy this morning.
[2:29:47] If you are in that hell, you are there
[2:29:50] to conquer.
[2:29:53] Hallelujah.
[2:29:55] Yes sir.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; You are there to conquer.
[2:29:59] Don't just look at me.
[2:30:02] You should conquer by saying amen.
[2:30:07] Amen. Amen. Why does he let things
[2:30:09] happen?
[2:30:11] Because he want us to also
[2:30:14] be like him to be conquerors
[2:30:18] like he
[2:30:21] and then he went to hell. He knocked on
[2:30:24] the head.
[2:30:25] No one open it. He found it open. He
[2:30:29] entered in. He told Satan, "I have come.
[2:30:33] I am the virgin born son of God.
[2:30:37] I have come to take over." And then he
[2:30:41] said to him, "Get him a key
[2:30:45] and a knockout punch."
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Give me the key."
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Sister fortunate.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Sister.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless you, brother. You know,
[2:31:00] it's our time right now to give the
[2:31:03] devil
[2:31:06] and give him a king. Tell him, "You know
[2:31:09] what?
[2:31:10] You have no keys to give us
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; because the keys were already taken from
[2:31:14] you.
[2:31:16] Hallelujah.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; Our mighty conqueror
[2:31:22] has the keys. He is the one that can
[2:31:25] open. He is the one that can close my
[2:31:30] life.
[2:31:32] Not in the hand of any stand.
[2:31:36] Hallelujah.
[2:31:38] [Applause]
[2:31:40] Hallelujah. And so he went in as a
[2:31:42] conqueror
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; and came out
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; and he conquered death. He conquered
[2:31:47] hell. He conquered the grave. And then
[2:31:50] when he rose up, the Bible says, he is
[2:31:54] seated.
[2:31:56] Amen. On the right hand of the majesty
[2:31:59] on high
[2:32:01] like Joseph.
[2:32:05] I feel like shouting. I have no place to
[2:32:06] shout.
[2:32:08] [Applause]
[2:32:09] Hallelujah.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Let me tell
[2:32:12] you something. Joseph was seated on the
[2:32:16] right hand not physically.
[2:32:20] It means he had authority.
[2:32:23] He was the next
[2:32:26] Jesus being on the right hand.
[2:32:30] It means authority.
[2:32:34] power.
[2:32:36] He has all authority
[2:32:39] all that the father had
[2:32:42] all in. No man can come to the father.
[2:32:46] But through the son and the bible says
[2:32:49] if you have the son
[2:32:51] you have the father only. But if you
[2:32:53] don't have the

[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; How many understand what I'm talking
[2:33:07] about?
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:33:11] I notic when Jesus was taken off the
[2:33:12] cross, he was also exalted
[2:33:15] and he was given an a name.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; I was 14 but these words came to me
[2:33:21] above every name.
[2:33:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There are the
[2:33:26] mention of the name Jesus.
[2:33:29] Every knee shall bow. Every tongue shall
[2:33:32] confess.
[2:33:34] That's why if you are not baptized in
[2:33:35] that name,
[2:33:38] you must be baptized again.
[2:33:42] If you are not sure you are baptized
[2:33:44] like that,
[2:33:46] be baptized again
[2:33:49] water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:33:52] Christ
[2:33:54] in the name of our mighty conqueror.
[2:33:57] We are the true Jesus people.
[2:34:00] [Applause]
[2:34:03] No man can come to God except by him.
[2:34:06] There is one mediator
[2:34:08] between God and man and he is all you
[2:34:12] need.
[2:34:14] There is no Mary's
[2:34:18] or saints
[2:34:21] just Jesus.
[2:34:24] Everybody shout Jesus.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:34:36] Keeping on with the type we find in
[2:34:38] Joseph.
[2:34:40] Notice how that everything that they did
[2:34:43] he did in Egypt prospered.
[2:34:47] His first job with the general
[2:34:48] prospered.
[2:34:51] Even the jail prospered.
[2:34:54] Even if you are a house boy or a house
[2:34:58] or you are helping somebody something
[2:35:01] whatever you are doing right now do not
[2:35:04] despise it.
[2:35:07] Hallelujah.

[2:36:18] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Some of us,
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; we need to tell the devil
[2:36:27] that the prison you've put me in this
[2:36:30] hell you're putting me in, you don't
[2:36:32] know what you're doing to me.
[2:36:35] Why? Because
[2:36:38] the devil will find himself.
[2:36:41] The prison will start prospering.
[2:36:45] Hallelujah.
[2:36:47] Yes.
[2:36:49] I thought I brought them here to
[2:36:50] persecute them.
[2:36:56] Some of you when you in a
[2:36:59] in hell,
[2:37:00] when you're in a trouble,
[2:37:03] you forget that you a Christian.
[2:37:06] Don't tell me don't
[2:37:09] if Jesus is with me, why am I suffering?
[2:37:12] Why is this test and that one? He's
[2:37:15] allowed it to
[2:37:17] You know who you are.
[2:37:21] Amen. Because
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; if you know who you are,
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; you will know that that is not your
[2:37:28] place.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Even the people who put you,
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; you will know that is not your position.
[2:37:35] Hallelujah.
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. When Jesus returns,
[2:37:43] the day that will blossom,
[2:37:46] he is the son of prosperity
[2:37:48] has no age ever pro prospered as the one
[2:37:50] under Joseph.
[2:37:54] So there is not such a time.
[2:37:57] So there is s there is a time of such
[2:38:00] blessing coming on this earth
[2:38:03] as the world has never known.
[2:38:09] [Music]
[2:38:11] The golden age President Trump is
[2:38:13] thinking about.
[2:38:17] He's just dreaming.
[2:38:20] It is only Jesus to bring you
[2:38:25] physically
[2:38:28] in the millennium.
[2:38:31] If you don't you go in the rapture,
[2:38:33] you'll be there to see. But if you
[2:38:36] remain in the tribulation,
[2:38:38] I'm sorry you'll miss it.
[2:38:42] There is a time coming
[2:38:44] such a blessing
[2:38:46] coming on this earth as the world has
[2:38:49] never known.
[2:38:51] We can every one of us sit under our own
[2:38:54] fig tree
[2:38:56] [Music]
[2:38:57] and laugh
[2:39:02] and laugh.
[2:39:06] You don't laugh unless you're happy
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; and rejoice
[2:39:12] and live
[2:39:15] forever
[2:39:16] in his presence.
[2:39:20] In his presence is the fullness of joy
[2:39:25] and on his right hand
[2:39:27] there are pleasure
[2:39:30] forever more.
[2:39:32] [Music]
[2:39:34] Praise God.
[2:39:37] That's why here on earth
[2:39:40] when we enter into his presence,
[2:39:44] you feel joy coming.
[2:39:47] You begin shouting, you begin jumping.
[2:39:50] Why? Why? In his presence in the
[2:39:53] fullness of joy.
[2:39:56] Have you ever been worshiing
[2:39:59] or praying and you're so happy you're
[2:40:02] like I wish this would not go away.
[2:40:05] How many have they ever experienced?
[2:40:08] Oh god. I wish I remain like this but
[2:40:11] after 1 2 3 4 hours and you feel tired.
[2:40:16] Slowly by slowly you come back to
[2:40:18] normal.
[2:40:20] But I tell you what, when we walk into
[2:40:22] that millennium,
[2:40:25] we will be in that presence forever.
[2:40:30] We shall laugh. We shall rejoice.
[2:40:34] We will sing
[2:40:36] and we will shout.
[2:40:38] When the redeemed
[2:40:41] are gathering,
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; when the redee
[2:40:45] sing with me,
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; wash like snow
[2:40:51] and free from
[2:40:54] see nothing. I will shine.
[2:40:58] Oh, you see now I will say
[2:41:01] when the redeemer
[2:41:04] are gathering.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Did you notice you can't sing that cross
[2:41:09] when you're sad?
[2:41:13] [Applause]
[2:41:15] Hallelujah. Turn your neighbor, tell
[2:41:16] them
[2:41:18] that time is coming.
[2:41:21] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; Wherever Joseph was, a trumpet was
[2:41:26] sound.
[2:41:28] And everyone bowed.
[2:41:31] And
[2:41:32] notice now, everywhere Joseph went, they
[2:41:36] sounded a trumpet to announce his
[2:41:38] arrival. The people would scream. They
[2:41:42] would bow a knee to Joseph. No matter
[2:41:44] what a man was doing. When that trumpet
[2:41:47] sounded, he bowed the knee. No matter
[2:41:50] what he was doing, he could have been
[2:41:52] selling something in the street,
[2:41:55] just reaching out for his money,
[2:41:59] reaching out for his money or maybe
[2:42:01] receiving whatever. But he had to stop
[2:42:07] and bend a knee
[2:42:10] just reaching out
[2:42:13] and then back
[2:42:16] when the trumpet blew. If he were even a
[2:42:19] performer
[2:42:21] or an actor,
[2:42:23] he would have to stop his eye
[2:42:26] and bow the knee
[2:42:29] to Joseph when his presence was
[2:42:30] announced
[2:42:32] with that trumpet.
[2:42:35] When the trumpet of the Lord shall
[2:42:36] sound,
[2:42:40] when the morning breaks eternal bright,
[2:42:45] the redeem of earth shall gather over on
[2:42:49] the other shore. When the roll is called
[2:42:53] a beyond, I'll be there.
[2:42:58] And one of these days everything in time
[2:43:03] will stand still
[2:43:06] when the trumpet of God shall sound
[2:43:10] and the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:43:12] and the morning will break a t of bright
[2:43:17] everything
[2:43:18] will bow the knee then
[2:43:22] for it is written. Tell your neighbor is
[2:43:24] written
[2:43:26] written. Come on now. someone does in
[2:43:28] television.
[2:43:32] Wherefore God also has highly exalted
[2:43:34] him
[2:43:36] and given him what?
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; Given him what?
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; A name which is above every name.
[2:43:47] A name which is above every name.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; Let me stop right here for a moment. A
[2:43:56] name which is above fear.
[2:43:59] Then fear is a name. Sickness is a name.
[2:44:04] HIV is a name.
[2:44:06] You know infection is a name.
[2:44:10] Blindness is a name.
[2:44:13] You get a point. Poverty is a name.
[2:44:17] Mention it.
[2:44:19] Lust is a name. Old is a name. You know
[2:44:24] fear. Oh fear. Anxiety.
[2:44:30] Anxiety.
[2:44:32] The devil wants to keep you anxious all
[2:44:34] the time. You're fearing what you don't
[2:44:36] know.
[2:44:38] You don't know what will happen to you.
[2:44:41] So you're in fear.
[2:44:44] I don't know what will happen.
[2:44:47] Those are names that the devil's names.
[2:44:51] Then the Bible say he rose again. He
[2:44:55] gave him a name above every name.
[2:44:59] A name above all those name
[2:45:03] mention of the name Jesus.
[2:45:06] Every knee should bow. Every knee should
[2:45:10] bow
[2:45:12] of things in heaven and things in earth
[2:45:16] and things.
[2:45:18] [Music]
[2:45:18] [Applause]
[2:45:21] Everything must bow at the mention of
[2:45:24] the name.
[2:45:26] Brother Kagan, this name is powerful.
[2:45:31] Healing is done in that name.
[2:45:34] That's why even water baptism
[2:45:36] must be in that name.
[2:45:41] If you are not baptized in that name,
[2:45:44] don't you worry. You are here and you
[2:45:47] have heard it because he loves you and
[2:45:50] is calling you.
[2:45:53] [Applause]
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; You see, every tongue should confess,
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that Jesus is Lord.
[2:46:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, if my sickness had a tongue,
[2:46:12] the sickness must come.
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; That Jesus is Lord.
[2:46:19] [Music]
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; Do you have some fears in your heart?
[2:46:23] Can you begin to say
[2:46:26] whatever your fear is? Fear. You must
[2:46:29] confess that Jesus is Lord.
[2:46:34] I'm no longer
[2:46:39] fear.
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; I am
[2:46:46] God.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; Have no fear.
[2:46:49] [Music]
[2:46:51] Why?
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Glory.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Because you have the son
[2:46:57] of prosperity
[2:46:59] at the mention of his name.
[2:47:02] When they call you, they calling him.
[2:47:05] Hallelujah.
[2:47:08] When he returns
[2:47:11] on earth, it will be a land of
[2:47:13] prosperity.
[2:47:15] The old deserts will blossom.
[2:47:19] And there will be food everywhere.
[2:47:22] And we can everyone sit under our own
[2:47:26] fig tree
[2:47:29] and live forever in his presence.
[2:47:32] when he comes back as a king.
[2:47:34] But I tell you what,
[2:47:36] there's something that I want to go into
[2:47:38] another phase before we conclude.
[2:47:42] It will happen. But I'm telling you,
[2:47:46] he's already here.
[2:47:50] Amen.
[2:47:52] Christ has been divorced
[2:47:57] from the denomination.
[2:48:00] He has been rejected
[2:48:02] just like Joseph. He has been scorned.
[2:48:07] You talk about water baptism in Jesus
[2:48:09] name.
[2:48:10] They'll begin talking about the trinity.
[2:48:13] They'll begin bringing their dogmas and
[2:48:17] they'll begin talking about infant
[2:48:19] baptism.
[2:48:21] They will reject the word.
[2:48:24] It is Jesus Joseph rejected by his
[2:48:27] brethren.
[2:48:29] The Bible says with their mouth they
[2:48:32] worship me but in their heart they have
[2:48:36] me they have a form of godliness
[2:48:40] but they have no fear
[2:48:44] they have rejected him you see that's
[2:48:47] why we see what we are saying
[2:48:50] men and women are confused
[2:48:52] they have forgotten their place you find
[2:48:55] them in their churches
[2:48:57] you know dancing All the kind of dancing
[2:49:00] that are supposed to be danced in the
[2:49:01] club
[2:49:04] and they're dancing it in the church in
[2:49:06] the church. They have rejected him.
[2:49:10] They have rejected the son of brother.
[2:49:14] They may say we are rich.
[2:49:17] We have a big church building.
[2:49:20] We have a lot of money.
[2:49:22] We have this. We have that.
[2:49:25] They said
[2:49:27] but he said they are poor wretched naked
[2:49:33] and they don't know.
[2:49:36] You see it's all about entertainment.
[2:49:40] It's not about the word. It's not about
[2:49:42] Christ. A woman has lost her place.
[2:49:47] When pastor is the pastor,
[2:49:51] his wife is the assistant.
[2:49:55] Oh, please join your hand. Let us
[2:49:57] welcome to Pastor Rebecca.
[2:50:04] Who told you
[2:50:07] there's nothing like a past?
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, I When God calls a man, he calls
[2:50:14] his wife.
[2:50:16] But everyone has their different roles.
[2:50:21] A man can't stand alone.
[2:50:23] He needs his wife. But his wife has a
[2:50:26] roles.
[2:50:28] I'm not talking about today's whatever.
[2:50:30] I'm talking about the word.
[2:50:34] You see, when you see their nails,
[2:50:38] it will be like as if they want to
[2:50:39] remove your eyes.
[2:50:44] And then you wonder why didn't God make
[2:50:46] you that way
[2:50:49] like an eagle.
[2:50:54] I wonder how they even do hygiene
[2:50:58] or how do they wash us
[2:51:00] friends is a spirit of loud disease
[2:51:06] that would take you away from the word.
[2:51:09] The word says you are fearfully and
[2:51:10] wonderfully made
[2:51:13] [Music]
[2:51:15] in this church. We preach you
[2:51:18] appreciating who you are.
[2:51:23] Forget about being who you are not.
[2:51:28] This is the age of cociousness.
[2:51:31] Everybody wants to be like somebody
[2:51:33] else.
[2:51:35] People have lost their identity.
[2:51:39] You know someone even who has a
[2:51:41] beautiful dark skin, they want to be
[2:51:43] white.
[2:51:47] They have good, beautiful, nice black
[2:51:49] small hair.
[2:51:53] They want to be like Beyonce.
[2:51:58] It's a spirit of the air.
[2:52:01] Pastor, is it breaking the word?
[2:52:04] Listen, when you are when you are led by
[2:52:06] the Holy Ghost,
[2:52:09] is no longer written or not written.
[2:52:13] The Holy Ghost will lead you to what God
[2:52:16] intended.
[2:52:21] All things are lawful for us.
[2:52:25] There is nothing binding us. But all
[2:52:28] things are not expedient.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; Know who you are.
[2:52:36] &gt;&gt; When you know who you are, No one will
[2:52:38] tell you how to dress,
[2:52:40] how to behave, what to say, what not to
[2:52:42] say.
[2:52:44] God will lead you.
[2:52:46] We are not legalists.
[2:52:49] We are following the spirit.
[2:52:53] Can we say amen to that?
[2:52:56] They have rejected the word. They have
[2:52:59] kicked him out of their church.
[2:53:01] You see, you find
[2:53:03] brothers, boys,
[2:53:06] as young and handsome as this
[2:53:09] dressing like girls
[2:53:12] and walking like
[2:53:15] it's a disgrace
[2:53:18] in our generation. What is all about is
[2:53:22] a spirit of paneer.
[2:53:26] Go research it.
[2:53:28] It's a spirit that has come to you know
[2:53:32] spoil their mind
[2:53:35] to make them go after the rudments of
[2:53:37] the world.
[2:53:41] You see and then on the other side you
[2:53:42] find women don't also want to dress like
[2:53:47] the devil has taken them and addressed
[2:53:49] them.
[2:53:51] He will the best he can do
[2:53:55] to cover their body
[2:53:58] is to make them wear men's trousers
[2:54:07] otherwise he will undress them
[2:54:11] friends we are ina
[2:54:15] and even by speaking these things
[2:54:18] many will feel like I'm trembling on
[2:54:19] their Right?
[2:54:21] [Music]
[2:54:22] But you see the Bible means people's
[2:54:25] rights.
[2:54:27] But this message we are preaching
[2:54:30] come to pull us out
[2:54:32] of
[2:54:34] bring us in Christ.
[2:54:37] When they reject the word they reject
[2:54:40] him. They are saying they are rich
[2:54:44] increase with good and have need of
[2:54:46] nothing. He say they are poor, rich,
[2:54:49] blind, naked. They don't know. He has
[2:54:52] spewed them out of his mouth
[2:54:55] because they rejected his word.
[2:54:58] Then he sends Malachi 4.
[2:55:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:55:04] &gt;&gt; To do what? To gather the bride of his
[2:55:07] word.
[2:55:10] Amen. She must be restored.

[2:55:15] preaching. By the way, we are not the
[2:55:17] only ones.
[2:55:19] If you are visiting today,
[2:55:21] &gt;&gt; I'll let you know we are not the only
[2:55:23] ones preaching this.
[2:55:25] There are people
[2:55:27] almost everywhere
[2:55:29] whose hearts are all
[2:55:32] flame.
[2:55:35] Come on, sing it.
[2:55:36] &gt;&gt; You are telling somebody who did not
[2:55:38] know
[2:55:40] them clean. It is burning now within my
[2:55:44] heart. All glory to his name.
[2:55:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[2:55:52] of them.
[2:55:56] They are all over the world.
[2:55:59] All over the world.
[2:56:01] Literally every city on earth.
[2:56:04] I said, "Pastor,
[2:56:09] we are a Bible church.
[2:56:11] [Music]
[2:56:13] We are non denominational.
[2:56:16] We're just Christians.
[2:56:19] That's exactly. And if you search and
[2:56:21] read your Bible,
[2:56:23] you will find. That's exactly how Paul
[2:56:25] was, how Timothy was, how Peter was. So
[2:56:29] these are our denominations.
[2:56:31] We don't know where they came from.
[2:56:34] But what I care about is the word.
[2:56:38] [Applause]
[2:56:41] Because the Bible is our absolute.
[2:56:44] This message of Yahweh resto
[2:56:50] his presence
[2:56:53] back to us.
[2:56:55] It is a message. Hey,
[2:56:58] of prosperity.
[2:57:00] Hallelujah. Now I am beginning my sermon
[2:57:07] which I'll preach for 20 minutes.
[2:57:10] It is a message of prosperity.
[2:57:14] Tell your neighbor the message of
[2:57:15] prosperity.
[2:57:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[2:57:21] This message which is the word which is
[2:57:25] Christ is a message of prosperity.
[2:57:30] Because who is the son of prosperity?
[2:57:33] It is Christ
[2:57:36] in you.
[2:57:39] &gt;&gt; The hope
[2:57:40] of glory,
[2:57:43] the hope of prosperity.
[2:57:49] As Christ was the first one to rise
[2:57:53] from all the prophets and so forth.
[2:57:56] Although typed in many places,
[2:57:59] he was the first fruits of those that
[2:58:00] slept.
[2:58:03] In the bride coming of Christ,
[2:58:07] coming out of the church,
[2:58:10] there will be a shift again in the last
[2:58:12] days.
[2:58:14] Waving of the she
[2:58:17] was the shift. The first one that come
[2:58:20] to mature,
[2:58:23] the first one that proved it was a weak.
[2:58:27] and pay proved it was a shift.
[2:58:30] I am sure you see what I'm talking
[2:58:31] about. It was welded over the people and
[2:58:35] the first time there will come forth
[2:58:39] for the bright edge
[2:58:42] for a resurrection out of dark
[2:58:44] denominationalism.
[2:58:49] There will be a message
[2:58:53] that the full maturity
[2:58:57] of the word
[2:58:59] was turned back again
[2:59:02] in its full power
[2:59:06] and being waved over the people
[2:59:10] by the same signs and wonders
[2:59:13] that he did back there. Now
[2:59:17] follow me now.
[2:59:19] The best part of the services around
[2:59:20] this area.
[2:59:23] If you miss it, you miss everything.
[2:59:27] Oh, I wish I would get into explanation,
[2:59:29] but without
[2:59:31] listen.
[2:59:33] God has to send a prophet
[2:59:38] with a message
[2:59:41] of restoration
[2:59:43] back again to the world.
[2:59:47] From where?
[2:59:49] &gt;&gt; From darkenominations.
[2:59:56] He brought me out
[2:59:59] from the mic
[3:00:01] and he put me
[3:00:04] on the rock.
[3:00:06] How many of you know?
[3:00:17] No,
[3:00:22] God picked us out
[3:00:25] and he put us on the rock
[3:00:28] of the word.
[3:00:30] You understand? So we are not of those
[3:00:33] that are still in Saturn's Eden.
[3:00:39] No,
[3:00:40] we are not. We are not a part of any
[3:00:43] denomination.
[3:00:46] Christ is coming to rapture
[3:00:49] the a word bride.
[3:00:54] When and how will he gather a word
[3:00:57] bride?
[3:00:59] He will always send a a word prophet.
[3:01:04] When God sends a prophet,
[3:01:07] the purpose is one to prosper you.
[3:01:11] A prophet from God
[3:01:14] will speak nothing but the truth of the
[3:01:16] word.
[3:01:18] Amen. Not that comes even to every
[3:01:21] preacher.
[3:01:23] Every preacher that has been sent from
[3:01:25] God
[3:01:26] will not come to entertain the people
[3:01:30] will come to teach the word.
[3:01:33] I don't know about you. When I go to
[3:01:36] church to sit down and listen to the
[3:01:37] word,
[3:01:39] I don't want to hear stories.
[3:01:42] I want to hear nothing but the word.
[3:01:46] He will have thus sayeth the Lord.
[3:01:50] Amen. And thus say the Lord never failed
[3:01:54] not even once. Show me in the Bible
[3:01:57] where God sent a prophet and he come
[3:02:00] with thus say the Lord and it failed.
[3:02:04] Thus say the Lord never fail.
[3:02:08] Amos 3:7 Surely God will do nothing but
[3:02:12] he reveals his secrets and serve as the
[3:02:15] prophet.
[3:02:16] The message is in Christ.
[3:02:20] Whatever God sends
[3:02:22] it will do what? The message will move
[3:02:26] on will prosper, will succeed and it
[3:02:30] will be like wild.
[3:02:34] No man can stop.
[3:02:39] When I was going to Ethiopia
[3:02:41] to preach this message,
[3:02:43] there was no believer in that country
[3:02:46] that we knew of the message. And a man
[3:02:49] told me, "Oh, you can't come here. It's
[3:02:52] very difficult. You have no money. You
[3:02:55] are poor.
[3:02:57] You don't know the language."
[3:02:59] He told me many things and you were
[3:03:02] young. He was true in everything he
[3:03:04] said.
[3:03:06] But it was true except he didn't say
[3:03:10] I had the son of prosperity.
[3:03:16] I had believed the message
[3:03:20] sent to us by the prophet of Malachi 4.
[3:03:26] How many have that message in their
[3:03:28] heart?
[3:03:29] When you believe that message,
[3:03:32] that message is Christ.
[3:03:35] Wherever you go, you have to prosper.
[3:03:38] You have to prosper.
[3:03:42] Are you getting what I'm saying?
[3:03:45] [Applause]
[3:03:46] My wife and I arrived in a strange
[3:03:50] country.
[3:03:52] No one we knew. But you know what? I
[3:03:55] don't remember dear was it the following
[3:03:57] day or the following week.
[3:03:59] The first weekend we met our first
[3:04:01] contact
[3:04:04] and that man heard this message.
[3:04:07] He said, "This is the truth. I want to
[3:04:10] be baptized." We baptized that manapt
[3:04:13] and he came out of the water, brought
[3:04:15] somebody else, brought somebody else,
[3:04:17] brought somebody else. And now there are
[3:04:19] hundreds of believers all around the
[3:04:20] country.
[3:04:23] And you know what? Then the government
[3:04:24] says, "Oh, you can't stay in Ethiopia
[3:04:28] because you have no uh Bible college
[3:04:31] certificate certific."
[3:04:40] And so I told him, "Yeah, I don't have
[3:04:42] it."
[3:04:43] So it's all right. I'll go back to my
[3:04:46] Some people said, "You can forge it. You
[3:04:47] can
[3:04:49] even go to Bible college." I'm sorry.
[3:04:52] God never set me with Bible college.
[3:04:56] Keep me in this country by Bible
[3:04:57] college.
[3:04:59] God never teaches any man by Bible
[3:05:01] college.
[3:05:04] Bible college. Bible college only
[3:05:05] teaches you church traditions and dogmas
[3:05:08] and Greek.
[3:05:13] If you want to know how God trained,
[3:05:16] he trains him by the word
[3:05:19] and in the back side of the desert
[3:05:22] where you meet God face to face.
[3:05:25] God has sent me.
[3:05:28] I told him, "God sent me here. I will
[3:05:31] not stay if it's a Bible college. I have
[3:05:35] to go back home." So he went back. We
[3:05:38] came back. Now people thought everything
[3:05:41] was going to be destroyed. But the work
[3:05:43] instead increased.
[3:05:46] There's something I'm trying to come to.
[3:05:48] It's not about me. I'm showing you
[3:05:49] something. The message is a seed.
[3:05:53] The truth is a seed. When you have
[3:05:56] received it, no man can pluck it away.
[3:06:00] [Applause]
[3:06:01] Hallelujah. No man can do it.
[3:06:04] And and everywhere it goes,
[3:06:09] there will be prosperity.
[3:06:11] Hallelujah.
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; How many were here when we first came
[3:06:19] here
[3:06:22] in this place?
[3:06:24] Raise up your hand.
[3:06:27] Just a few.
[3:06:29] You remember how this place?
[3:06:33] Everybody say, "Son of prosperity."
[3:06:38] Now, now you're beginning to understand
[3:06:41] the message. It's not the man. It's not
[3:06:44] you. It's not me. It's the message in
[3:06:47] Christ in you.
[3:06:50] Wherever you go,
[3:06:53] if you are a believer,
[3:06:56] prosperity must follow.
[3:06:59] Hallelujah. You must succeed.
[3:07:03] Don't say this job is very hard.
[3:07:07] you will succeed.
[3:07:10] Whatever you need has already been given
[3:07:11] you.
[3:07:14] You don't need any man to favor you.
[3:07:19] God has already favored you
[3:07:22] by sending you Elijah
[3:07:24] by giving you the message of the hour by
[3:07:27] calling you out of darkness
[3:07:31] setting you in his word.
[3:07:36] Hallelujah.
[3:07:37] &gt;&gt; Second Kings chapter 4. This is where we
[3:07:40] are going to climax now.
[3:07:43] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. I
[3:07:46] want to show you an example of what I'm
[3:07:47] talking about.
[3:07:50] Let us now take it practically.
[3:07:55] Second Kings. Father, give me the verses
[3:07:59] vers one. Now there cried a certain
[3:08:03] woman of the wives of the sons of the
[3:08:06] prophets unto Elishah.
[3:08:11] By the way, we need a screen.
[3:08:13] &gt;&gt; We need a screen here. Right there
[3:08:16] somewhere right there somewhere.
[3:08:19] I need a screen.
[3:08:21] So if you God moves on you, please do it
[3:08:26] so that sometimes the song leaders don't
[3:08:27] know the words, want to look at
[3:08:31] or the preacher turn.
[3:08:34] Praise the name of the Lord. Now there
[3:08:36] cried a certain woman of the wives of
[3:08:39] the sons of the prophets.
[3:08:42] And to Elisha said, "Thy servant, my
[3:08:45] husband, is dead,
[3:08:48] and thou knowest that thy servant did
[3:08:51] fear the Lord."
[3:08:53] and the creditor.
[3:08:55] and a creditor.
[3:08:58] &gt;&gt; Who understands who a creditor is?
[3:09:08] If they have never demanded money from
[3:09:10] you, you don't know what
[3:09:12] somebody can do and you really want to
[3:09:15] die
[3:09:17] and the creditor
[3:09:20] is come to take unto my unto him my two
[3:09:23] sons to be bond men.
[3:09:29] Here is a woman, a woman of God.
[3:09:34] She was married to a man of God,
[3:09:37] but her husband was now dead.
[3:09:41] And now when he saw prophet Elisha,
[3:09:44] you remember prophet Elisha had the
[3:09:46] anointing and the spirit of Elijah
[3:09:52] a double portion.
[3:09:55] And you know the message we are
[3:09:56] preaching is a message of Elijah.
[3:10:01] Hey
[3:10:02] when he saw prophet Elishah
[3:10:05] she ran
[3:10:07] and told him hey my husband is
[3:10:11] And you know him, you knew him. He was a
[3:10:14] servant at the world.
[3:10:16] But the creditors,
[3:10:21] the creditors,
[3:10:23] they come, they want to take my two
[3:10:27] as slaves.
[3:10:30] And Elisha said unto her, "What shall I
[3:10:34] do for thee?"
[3:10:37] Ask your neighbor, "What shall I do for
[3:10:38] you?
[3:10:42] Amen.
[3:10:43] Amen.
[3:10:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe you are also having a character.
[3:10:48] Maybe you have many problems which you
[3:10:50] can say pastor if I begin my problems I
[3:10:52] can't finish them.
[3:10:57] And pastor that's even why I you know
[3:11:00] you want my in my heart
[3:11:04] I really want to serve God and attend
[3:11:06] church every Sunday
[3:11:08] and and give to to all these projects
[3:11:11] the church is doing and everything but
[3:11:14] I'm a widow I have no job and I have
[3:11:18] credit
[3:11:22] if I begin to tell you my problem
[3:11:25] I can't finish that.
[3:11:27] &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you what the problem is
[3:11:29] with you.
[3:11:31] You do not know what you have in you.
[3:11:36] Hallelujah. The problem is not that the
[3:11:40] situation you are saying is not true.
[3:11:44] But if you will ever have a reason
[3:11:48] not to serve God,
[3:11:51] it is only because you do not know what
[3:11:52] you have. Ah,
[3:11:59] I'm praying that as I speak this word,
[3:12:02] the Holy Spirit will reveal it to you.
[3:12:06] What we have is a sign of prosperity.
[3:12:10] What we have is the oil.
[3:12:14] The message is Christ.
[3:12:17] The message is the spirit. It's the
[3:12:19] spirit
[3:12:21] that does the work. It's not you.
[3:12:24] It is him in you, Christ in you, the
[3:12:28] hope of glory. You are hopeless. But
[3:12:31] when you have Christ in you, you become
[3:12:33] hopeful.
[3:12:35] You even begin to see activities you
[3:12:38] never thought you had. You begin to
[3:12:40] realize you are greater than you knew.
[3:12:43] You begin to realize
[3:12:47] that are laying down in you
[3:12:49] more than you thought.
[3:12:52] The only way to activate
[3:12:56] those potentials
[3:12:58] is first realizing what you have.
[3:13:04] [Music]
[3:13:05] [Applause]
[3:13:09] What I'm telling you tonight is the
[3:13:11] principle number one of prosperity.
[3:13:17] May God reveal it to you.
[3:13:20] My time is almost going down. Let's push
[3:13:22] on here. And Elisha said unto her, "What
[3:13:26] shall I do for you, woman?
[3:13:29] Tell me."
[3:13:31] And the woman never answered.
[3:13:36] until until
[3:13:40] the prophet of God said,
[3:13:43] "What hast thou in the house?"
[3:13:46] Ask your neighbor, "What do you have?
[3:13:49] What do you have? What do you have in
[3:13:52] the house?
[3:13:54] What do you have in the house?
[3:13:58] What's your house?
[3:13:59] &gt;&gt; I wish I had time, but let me What your
[3:14:01] house, your body, soul, spirit.
[3:14:05] But I'm talking about the man in the
[3:14:07] middle of the man.
[3:14:09] I'm talking about the deepest in you.
[3:14:13] I have Christ.
[3:14:15] I have the oil. I have the word.
[3:14:20] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[3:14:22] &gt;&gt; What do you have in your house? And she
[3:14:26] said,
[3:14:27] &gt;&gt; thine handmade
[3:14:30] does not have anything in the house.
[3:14:34] That is our problem.
[3:14:38] The problem of the church
[3:14:42] is they do not understand
[3:14:45] that the things they see
[3:14:48] are not real. But the things they don't
[3:14:51] see
[3:14:53] are real.
[3:14:55] Brethren, if we are going to serve God,
[3:14:58] we have to grow.
[3:15:01] We cannot remain children forever.
[3:15:04] We have to understand how God runs his
[3:15:07] kingdom.
[3:15:10] Amen. If God wants to prosper,
[3:15:14] you as an individual,
[3:15:16] I tell you, he cannot
[3:15:20] unless
[3:15:21] you you in your heart, you are purposed
[3:15:26] obey his word to run his kingdom.
[3:15:30] Then when he sees that that it's not
[3:15:33] about you, then he will activate
[3:15:37] the son of prosperity
[3:15:42] which will take care of all the problems
[3:15:45] you have
[3:15:48] and the problems you never thought you
[3:15:50] have.
[3:15:54] I am going to speak a few statements in
[3:15:57] a few moments before I close.
[3:16:00] I didn't know but I've just known now
[3:16:03] but I want you to tie your belts right
[3:16:05] now.
[3:16:08] Those who are visiting us this morning I
[3:16:10] don't always speak these words
[3:16:13] but you know what the church is changing
[3:16:16] faces
[3:16:21] and we as a congregation
[3:16:24] need to know where we are headed.
[3:16:27] We need to know how it is done.
[3:16:31] How is it? How is it done?
[3:16:34] How do you make that son of prosperity
[3:16:38] to work for you?
[3:16:43] How does it work?
[3:16:45] That's what I want us to know in just a
[3:16:48] short while. Follow me closely here. So
[3:16:51] the woman said, "I have nothing." We
[3:16:55] always see in terms of money.
[3:17:01] We always see in terms of wealth.
[3:17:05] But God doesn't see that.
[3:17:08] God sees in terms of the deepest in your
[3:17:12] heart.
[3:17:17] If you truly say you are who you say you
[3:17:19] are,
[3:17:21] you have something in you to prosper
[3:17:24] you.
[3:17:26] Hallelujah. But you need to receive the
[3:17:28] revelation.
[3:17:30] You need to catch the vision.
[3:17:33] [Applause]
[3:17:35] &gt;&gt; So the woman said, "I have nothing."
[3:17:41] except
[3:17:44] the little pot of oil.
[3:17:50] Someone needed to tell this woman.
[3:17:53] That's all you need.
[3:17:58] Hallelujah. That's all you need.
[3:18:01] That's all you need. Forget about what
[3:18:04] you don't have. Look at what you have.
[3:18:07] Because what you have is all you need
[3:18:11] and what you don't
[3:18:15] my
[3:18:16] &gt;&gt; as I'm speaking to you I am just busting
[3:18:19] into revelations right now.
[3:18:23] Then he said follow this story.
[3:18:27] Then he said, then he said, you would
[3:18:31] think that this man of God at such a
[3:18:35] time
[3:18:37] with such a widow, he would just
[3:18:40] activate
[3:18:43] his prophetic power
[3:18:47] and cause
[3:18:49] this woman is there to be cancelled
[3:18:52] [Music]
[3:18:55] like the prophets of today.
[3:18:57] I cancel your debt.
[3:19:02] How do you cancel that?
[3:19:05] &gt;&gt; I am going to show you today true debt
[3:19:07] cancellation.
[3:19:12] If you have debts,
[3:19:15] they are going to be cancelled.
[3:19:17] But in the way of the word,
[3:19:20] sister, you better be very fast and not
[3:19:21] miss.
[3:19:23] Listen now. Praise the name of the Lord.
[3:19:26] Hallelujah.
[3:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet said,
[3:19:35] &gt;&gt; "Woman, I cancel your debt."
[3:19:41] Woman,
[3:19:43] a praise, a blessing.
[3:19:49] Many times you are going through a tough
[3:19:51] time. You are rushing to the pastor to
[3:19:53] pray.
[3:19:55] Let me tell you, anything to do with
[3:19:57] substance,
[3:20:01] never pray about it.
[3:20:03] Do something about it. Hallelujah.
[3:20:07] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? So the prophet
[3:20:10] said, "Go
[3:20:13] borrow
[3:20:15] the vessels abroad
[3:20:20] of all the neighbors.
[3:20:22] Empty
[3:20:24] empty vessels
[3:20:28] but not a few.
[3:20:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. What is God trying to do?
[3:20:34] Something is happening
[3:20:37] at that moment.
[3:20:41] Listen.
[3:20:42] There is a twofold mystery
[3:20:47] unfolding.
[3:20:50] one the woman doing what the prophet
[3:20:54] said exactly the way he said
[3:21:01] who told what the prophet to say why
[3:21:07] not the woman see but prophet Elisha why
[3:21:11] didn't we agree first
[3:21:14] and then so you can tell me to do what I
[3:21:17] am able
[3:21:20] No. God doesn't work like that. God
[3:21:23] leads his own man.
[3:21:28] Amen. Who told Elisha what to say? God
[3:21:32] told him what to say.
[3:21:35] God told the church.
[3:21:38] Let them go out and gather empty
[3:21:40] vessels.
[3:21:43] And he said, "Go, gather empty vessels.
[3:21:47] Make sure they're empty. bring them.
[3:21:50] &gt;&gt; What? This is a woman.
[3:21:54] She She's a widow. She's old.
[3:21:57] She's poor. Maybe she doesn't have
[3:22:00] associate.
[3:22:01] How will she do it?
[3:22:04] How will she carry it? She wasn't
[3:22:06] supposed to do it with somebody else.
[3:22:10] It was only by herself
[3:22:13] with her own hand. She had to do this.
[3:22:16] She had to obey.
[3:22:19] So the twofold mystery is
[3:22:21] one she went and did what the man of God
[3:22:24] said
[3:22:27] exactly what he said. Two she obeyed the
[3:22:30] voice of the prophet.
[3:22:36] Both those things were difficult.
[3:22:40] I don't have I have creditors and you're
[3:22:44] telling me to go and borrow more.
[3:22:47] Man of God, what's wrong with you? The
[3:22:49] man of God is trying to tell us
[3:22:52] this is the way to become prosperous.
[3:22:58] I'm giving you a key woman.
[3:23:01] But in the process, the prophet never
[3:23:03] told her
[3:23:06] that this is what is going to take you
[3:23:07] out of your debt.
[3:23:10] He simply told her what to do.
[3:23:13] But many even today they don't take care
[3:23:18] what God tells us to do.
[3:23:23] Well, the vision of the church,
[3:23:26] let the pastor handle it
[3:23:29] for us. We have issues
[3:23:31] stressing.
[3:23:33] If I look at my dates now and then what
[3:23:38] sincerely
[3:23:41] things also
[3:23:42] &gt;&gt; they are becoming hard
[3:23:48] why can't I change a church
[3:23:50] don't do these kind of things
[3:23:57] I'm not kind of brother
[3:24:00] I'm inspired what I'm speaking right
[3:24:04] Amen.
[3:24:06] &gt;&gt; When you do that,
[3:24:09] you are not like this woman.
[3:24:13] You've not understood
[3:24:15] how it works.
[3:24:19] But I want you to follow
[3:24:22] and see how it works
[3:24:26] and then we we will finish.
[3:24:29] What did he say?
[3:24:30] &gt;&gt; So the woman went
[3:24:32] and borrowed
[3:24:34] many vessels
[3:24:37] as much as she can get.
[3:24:40] She suffered. She went abroad.
[3:24:43] I don't know abroad. Is it Kenya or I
[3:24:46] don't
[3:24:48] but she went as far as she can go.
[3:24:51] Please borrow me. I'll return. He didn't
[3:24:54] even tell her what to say.
[3:24:58] It's not none of the prophet's business.
[3:25:01] Just go and borrow.
[3:25:04] There's something you can do. If you
[3:25:07] have something, there is something you
[3:25:08] can do. Tell your neighbor, "If you have
[3:25:10] something, there is something.
[3:25:15] And if you have nothing,
[3:25:17] you just don't know.
[3:25:20] You just don't have the revelation."
[3:25:24] And I hope that God will give it to you.
[3:25:27] and she borrowed it and brought it. And
[3:25:30] when you are coming,
[3:25:32] thou shalt shut the door
[3:25:37] upon thee and upon thy sons,
[3:25:42] and you will power out
[3:25:45] into those vessels.
[3:25:48] Not
[3:25:53] No,
[3:25:57] this has to be a personal revelation.
[3:26:03] Shut yourselves outside.
[3:26:05] Shut everybody outside. Come in. I won't
[3:26:08] do it for you. Woman, you yourself
[3:26:12] bring those vessels
[3:26:17] after you filled it up.
[3:26:19] Now, hey, there's something
[3:26:22] now. Begin to pour
[3:26:26] into those vessels. And thou shalt set
[3:26:29] aside that which is full.
[3:26:33] The prophet brother was creating
[3:26:38] [Music]
[3:26:40] without telling the woman.
[3:26:42] Okay? If you don't understand what I'm
[3:26:43] saying,
[3:26:48] brother, come. Come, come, bring that
[3:26:50] bottle.
[3:26:52] See what I'm saying, brothers? Come up.
[3:26:54] Come up. Come up. You're a very good
[3:26:56] singer, are you not? Stand right here. I
[3:27:00] love your boldness whenever you're
[3:27:01] singing. So now,
[3:27:03] this is a small bottle.
[3:27:06] This is the oil she had. The only one
[3:27:08] she had. But these are big. Do you have
[3:27:11] big empty ones?
[3:27:15] Now,
[3:27:17] this was empty.
[3:27:19] All those of you who are outside, come
[3:27:20] in. Come in. Come in. If you can't hear
[3:27:24] me properly, come in cuz this you must
[3:27:26] get it.
[3:27:28] And then man of God,
[3:27:32] he told her power
[3:27:37] begin powering.
[3:27:41] [Music]
[3:27:45] You see what he's telling him to do? It
[3:27:47] is impossible.
[3:27:49] God specializes
[3:27:52] in impossible
[3:27:55] to make it possible.
[3:27:57] The vessels were big.
[3:28:00] The oil she had was small.
[3:28:04] But this woman had to have such faith
[3:28:10] to believe in what the man of God said.
[3:28:15] She did not have to question anything.
[3:28:18] She had to believe and do
[3:28:20] by faith.
[3:28:24] And the man of God say every vessel that
[3:28:27] is full you can set aside
[3:28:31] aside.
[3:28:34] Which means the man of God created
[3:28:37] a little oil
[3:28:40] will fill all the empty vessels
[3:28:43] one by one.
[3:28:46] One by one by one.
[3:28:49] And it will all be done by her.
[3:28:53] and the woman obeyed.
[3:28:58] So she went from him
[3:29:00] and she shut the door upon her and her
[3:29:04] son who brought the vessels to her and
[3:29:09] she poured out.
[3:29:11] And it came to pass when the vessels
[3:29:14] were full
[3:29:16] that she said unto her son,
[3:29:21] friends,
[3:29:24] as I was reading this scripture,
[3:29:27] I know I can take it many different
[3:29:28] ways.
[3:29:30] Scripture has compound meaning.
[3:29:33] But God gave me a Rama word
[3:29:37] for the church.
[3:29:41] If there was a service I never wanted
[3:29:43] streamed is this one
[3:29:47] because this is for you.
[3:29:50] Amen.
[3:29:51] &gt;&gt; For you members of this fellowship.
[3:29:54] Amen. And so listen carefully. And so it
[3:29:57] came to pass
[3:29:59] when the vessels were full
[3:30:02] that she said unto her son,
[3:30:06] "Bring me yet a vessel."
[3:30:12] But listen, and he said unto her, "There
[3:30:15] is not a vessel more."
[3:30:18] And the oil stayed.
[3:30:21] Now let's go close.
[3:30:23] This woman, why did she have to send for
[3:30:26] more vessels?
[3:30:30] Because
[3:30:32] what she had brought in earlier
[3:30:36] was according to the revelation that she
[3:30:39] had.
[3:30:43] When she realized
[3:30:45] that this works,
[3:30:47] she wanted to go beyond her revelation.
[3:30:52] It couldn't work.
[3:30:55] Her son's revelation
[3:30:57] is not hers. Her son immediately told
[3:31:00] her there is not even one more.
[3:31:04] He didn't catch it. If only he had
[3:31:07] caught it, they would have had much more
[3:31:10] oil.
[3:31:14] But he didn't catch it. And she if only
[3:31:19] she had brought in a lot more, a lot
[3:31:21] more
[3:31:24] a lot more.
[3:31:26] &gt;&gt; She would have been much more worthy,
[3:31:29] [Music]
[3:31:32] but she did not
[3:31:37] go beyond her revelation.
[3:31:42] And so the man of God came
[3:31:45] and said,
[3:31:49] "Go
[3:31:50] sell the oil
[3:31:53] and pay thy debt
[3:31:56] and leave
[3:31:58] thou and thy children
[3:32:01] of the rest."
[3:32:07] She never asked
[3:32:10] for money.
[3:32:12] to live day by day.
[3:32:18] But what was given her
[3:32:21] to live day by day
[3:32:24] was on the basis
[3:32:28] of how much and many vessels she collect
[3:32:33] by faith.
[3:32:36] when she had nothing.
[3:32:43] I have other quotes. I'm no longer going
[3:32:44] to read.
[3:32:46] I'm done preaching. And now this is for
[3:32:49] the church.
[3:32:53] So if you are streaming this none of
[3:32:55] your business,
[3:32:58] brethren, as I was studying in my office
[3:33:03] and praying and
[3:33:05] and knowing what God can do and
[3:33:10] what God has done before
[3:33:14] and discussing with many friends and
[3:33:18] what God has done in other places,
[3:33:21] it brought me to a place
[3:33:23] Are you not the same God?
[3:33:27] And at first I was like, "Oh, God, if it
[3:33:31] was possible, I would never want anyone
[3:33:33] in the church
[3:33:35] to give any of their subject.
[3:33:40] I would want to do everything. Lord, if
[3:33:42] you can give me a big business
[3:33:45] and I sponsor all the youth meetings and
[3:33:49] buy the land of the church,
[3:33:52] the people come and I just give them the
[3:33:53] word.
[3:33:55] &gt;&gt; And it was right there that the Holy
[3:33:58] Spirit began to minister
[3:34:00] that that's not how it works
[3:34:04] and it took me to this scripture
[3:34:07] and you can tell that this is very
[3:34:09] emotional for me.
[3:34:12] It took me to this scripture and as I
[3:34:14] read it over,
[3:34:17] he began to, you know, minister to me
[3:34:19] personally.
[3:34:21] And I preached it to my my my family.
[3:34:26] It stirred my revelation.
[3:34:29] And by the time I started preaching son
[3:34:31] of prosperity, I even had not seen
[3:34:36] like got the inspiration of it.
[3:34:39] And then he began to minister to me. He
[3:34:42] said this is exactly
[3:34:45] what I have already revealed to you.
[3:34:49] listen to do and to instruct the church
[3:34:52] to do.
[3:34:55] And if you notice on Sunday, I talked
[3:34:58] about the plan, but I never went into
[3:35:00] details
[3:35:02] because I was still struggling.
[3:35:05] But Lord, is this your way?
[3:35:07] Are we fulling putting for money? Are we
[3:35:09] not stressing the people?
[3:35:12] People have problems. People have
[3:35:13] issues.
[3:35:15] And then when I saw this scripture,
[3:35:18] it all opened up.
[3:35:21] And I tell you what, this is not my
[3:35:24] revelation.
[3:35:26] This is the inspiration from the Holy
[3:35:27] Spirit
[3:35:29] for the local church here.
[3:35:31] What God wants to do with us
[3:35:34] and for us. Anybody that will walk into
[3:35:39] like this woman,
[3:35:44] you're going to pay your debts.
[3:35:47] Not only that, you are no longer going
[3:35:49] to need in your home
[3:35:53] in the manner you have been needing
[3:35:57] because the son of prosperity
[3:36:00] will be activated
[3:36:04] in your own home.
[3:36:07] Hallelujah. And then I began to ask Lord
[3:36:09] how is it going to
[3:36:12] then you know I called the brother spoke
[3:36:14] to them and it looked hard it looked
[3:36:17] difficult but I said well I'm going to
[3:36:19] tell them
[3:36:21] and with with the well even what has
[3:36:24] already been accomplished
[3:36:27] even what has already been accomplished
[3:36:29] I can say it is God
[3:36:32] is not our ability
[3:36:34] it has been God he has led us From day
[3:36:37] one
[3:36:39] when we were in the home fellowship when
[3:36:42] we moved all the way up there in the
[3:36:44] small place
[3:36:45] we moved here. Everybody's not here. If
[3:36:49] everybody's here, we no longer have
[3:36:51] enough chairs.
[3:36:54] So we have already filled up the space.
[3:36:56] So we need a place of
[3:36:59] and but I was began to think what has
[3:37:02] happened
[3:37:04] is not a man.
[3:37:06] It is God.
[3:37:09] The piece of land which we have acquired
[3:37:13] that place where it is
[3:37:18] not a man.
[3:37:20] It is God.
[3:37:22] It is God.
[3:37:24] How many remember when I told you about
[3:37:27] the you know seeing this place and
[3:37:28] before we even came here?
[3:37:34] Yeah some people remember. But Martin,
[3:37:36] do you remember before we paid that
[3:37:37] price
[3:37:40] the the the the place, the land which we
[3:37:42] now have? What did I tell you? Do you
[3:37:45] remember when I told you the
[3:37:47] construction and everything? Do you
[3:37:48] remember?
[3:37:51] You don't. Is that brother Martin?
[3:37:56] Do you remember about that construction
[3:37:57] which I told you?
[3:38:00] &gt;&gt; All right. As I say, you you'll remember
[3:38:03] cuz this is way back before we even came
[3:38:06] in this area.
[3:38:08] You know, I saw a construction
[3:38:11] and at this construction, I was walking
[3:38:14] over it.
[3:38:16] But it was that this is the place
[3:38:19] where we were going to have our church.
[3:38:22] So I saw it way back when I was still in
[3:38:24] Mitan.
[3:38:26] I told it to my wife. I told it to
[3:38:28] brother.
[3:38:30] Have you remembered now or you've not
[3:38:31] remembered?
[3:38:33] &gt;&gt; Huh? Louder, brother.
[3:38:36] &gt;&gt; You've remembered. Okay. So, so then I
[3:38:39] was like, but I don't know because I
[3:38:41] don't know whether this is a place
[3:38:43] because it might be another place.
[3:38:46] But when I went that place,
[3:38:49] I think it was either before after
[3:38:52] taking you there,
[3:38:55] I we saw that big iron sheet.
[3:39:00] and and I walked I wanted to I was
[3:39:03] curious to see what are they doing.
[3:39:06] So the man told me that this entire
[3:39:09] piece of land is actually the same
[3:39:12] same owner but he sold that piece to
[3:39:15] somebody else.
[3:39:17] Uh where's brother Neville? Are you
[3:39:18] here? You remember when he went to
[3:39:19] search it he found the same piece of
[3:39:22] land. So now when when I went there,
[3:39:26] I started walking
[3:39:29] over the foundations
[3:39:31] of the building. They're building it.
[3:39:33] It's like a
[3:39:34] &gt;&gt; What kind of building are they building
[3:39:35] there?
[3:39:37] &gt;&gt; Apartment. Yes.
[3:39:39] &gt;&gt; So it's a large building and as I was
[3:39:42] walking
[3:39:45] I started remembering this looks
[3:39:47] familiar. Where did I see?
[3:39:50] I remembered.
[3:39:52] So, so I start asking the Lord, could
[3:39:54] this be the place?
[3:39:56] Could this be the place?
[3:39:59] Turns out that we buy that exact place
[3:40:06] and I walked over the foundation
[3:40:09] the building as I had seen
[3:40:12] much earlier. So, I have no doubt
[3:40:15] that God is leading us.
[3:40:18] I have no doubt that God is leading us.
[3:40:22] And so now with all this money
[3:40:24] remaining,
[3:40:26] 120 million shillings,
[3:40:29] it's a lot of money for us, as young as
[3:40:33] we are, as small as we are.
[3:40:36] So a few people came to me said,
[3:40:38] "Pastor,
[3:40:40] some people are worried because they're
[3:40:42] saying if we were raising this 100
[3:40:45] million in many years,
[3:40:48] How are we going to raise 120 million
[3:40:52] in 6 months?
[3:40:54] It's hard.
[3:40:56] &gt;&gt; It's hard. Is it going to be possible?
[3:41:00] &gt;&gt; And that's that's why it took me into
[3:41:02] this kind of agonizing.
[3:41:05] And as I was reading this scripture,
[3:41:07] started to interpret it. The Holy Spirit
[3:41:09] would begin to interpret it to me.
[3:41:11] And um let's let's read it now. This is
[3:41:14] a remma for us here as a church. And I
[3:41:16] want to do it over again now
[3:41:18] interpreting it for you. Um let let us
[3:41:22] look at verse one. And this is very very
[3:41:23] important for us.
[3:41:25] &gt;&gt; There cried a certain woman of the wives
[3:41:27] of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha.
[3:41:31] Thy servants my husband is dead and thou
[3:41:34] brother just do it with me. And thou
[3:41:37] knowest that the thy servant did fear
[3:41:39] the Lord.
[3:41:41] And the creditor has come to take unto
[3:41:44] him my two sons.
[3:41:46] to be born men. And this is how it is
[3:41:50] with us, many problems. Some of you
[3:41:53] business people, I know you have
[3:41:54] creditors,
[3:41:56] it's not easy financially. And and now
[3:42:00] with all these burdens,
[3:42:02] we have to get funds for the land of the
[3:42:05] church in such a short time. What are we
[3:42:09] going to do? And this is what Elisha
[3:42:11] told her. What shall I do for thee?
[3:42:16] What hast thou in the house?
[3:42:21] And then the Lord began to minister to
[3:42:22] me.
[3:42:24] Whatever the people need,
[3:42:27] they already have,
[3:42:29] they simply need to activate.
[3:42:40] &gt;&gt; We have the son of prosperity.
[3:42:43] We have Jesus. We don't have a lot of
[3:42:45] wealth, but we have Jesus. We have the
[3:42:49] word. We have a burden. We have an
[3:42:52] assignment. We have a world to help. We
[3:42:55] have sinners to save. We have a gospel
[3:42:58] to preach. We have a cause.
[3:43:02] We are not a causeless church.
[3:43:05] We have a cause. We have a burden. And
[3:43:09] this is what we have.
[3:43:11] And also God has blessed us
[3:43:15] with a little what we call mega fair.
[3:43:21] Some some of you are simply even help to
[3:43:24] come here to church
[3:43:27] supported with transport
[3:43:30] a few young ones here not everybody but
[3:43:32] you know what I'm saying is we don't
[3:43:34] have a lot
[3:43:36] but you see that's what we have.
[3:43:39] &gt;&gt; All you have is a meal for your
[3:43:40] children.
[3:43:42] All you have is rent.
[3:43:44] All you have is a little to pay these
[3:43:46] bills and that.
[3:43:48] And that's why you say I have nothing.
[3:43:52] Save a pot of oil. Save a little. But
[3:43:54] then he said, "Go borrow these vessels
[3:43:57] abroad
[3:43:59] of all thy neighbors
[3:44:01] are even empty vessels.
[3:44:04] Borrow not a few."
[3:44:08] And these verses
[3:44:10] is exactly what we are doing. Brother,
[3:44:12] brother brother Dan tried to explain for
[3:44:14] the church
[3:44:17] and and this brother Neville,
[3:44:21] you know, uh and and and you know to to
[3:44:24] have everybody do something.
[3:44:28] And so um but even if we say that
[3:44:30] everybody does something, not everybody
[3:44:32] is having the same amount
[3:44:37] of faith. And then God began to minister
[3:44:40] to me.
[3:44:42] It's not according to what they have.
[3:44:47] It's according to their faith.
[3:44:51] Not according to what they have, but
[3:44:54] according to their faith.
[3:45:01] We have weeks
[3:45:03] everybody's going to collect.
[3:45:06] Brother Dan said to us
[3:45:09] that um and I didn't plan to say these
[3:45:13] things this way but I was constrained by
[3:45:14] the Holy Spirit.
[3:45:19] We need 120 million
[3:45:21] finish up that line. But what we decided
[3:45:24] to do and I came and announced to you
[3:45:27] here what we have decided to do is to
[3:45:30] pass it out to the church. Everybody,
[3:45:33] let everybody
[3:45:35] go and collect vessels.
[3:45:40] Just listen.
[3:45:42] Not a few,
[3:45:44] but according to their faith,
[3:45:48] as much as they can collect.
[3:45:51] I don't care how you got the money.
[3:45:54] Just don't steal.
[3:45:56] But you see, these are empty vessels. So
[3:46:00] it's not cash,
[3:46:01] &gt;&gt; it is pledges.
[3:46:06] &gt;&gt; How much are you contributing? Come
[3:46:08] here.
[3:46:10] &gt;&gt; How much did you did did you pledge to
[3:46:12] give
[3:46:14] &gt;&gt; towards the land fund? 1.5. Now
[3:46:19] brother Shalom here has no job
[3:46:23] yet. He's still in school.
[3:46:27] He is doing a few projects here and
[3:46:28] there.
[3:46:30] But
[3:46:32] he has collected a vessel
[3:46:37] 1.5 million vessels.
[3:46:43] That is as much
[3:46:45] as he can gather.
[3:46:48] And that is according to his faith.
[3:46:52] It's according to his faith. Do you have
[3:46:54] the money?
[3:46:56] No. Do you know how you're going to get
[3:46:58] it?
[3:47:00] Maybe with the projects that I'm doing.
[3:47:02] &gt;&gt; Are you allowed, brother?
[3:47:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe through the projects that I'm
[3:47:05] doing.
[3:47:05] &gt;&gt; Maybe. So, you're not sure?
[3:47:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not embarrassing him. He's a
[3:47:11] minister, so I'm using him as an example
[3:47:14] by faith. He has collected 1.5 million
[3:47:17] vessels.
[3:47:20] They are vessels, but empty.
[3:47:26] It's not real.
[3:47:29] There's nothing in there, but it's an
[3:47:31] empty vessel.
[3:47:34] And so the Holy Spirit ministered to me
[3:47:37] that every pledge
[3:47:40] anyone is going to make towards that
[3:47:44] purpose
[3:47:45] of the land fund
[3:47:48] will be seen as that vessel
[3:47:54] that they will bring.
[3:47:57] By bringing a pledge,
[3:48:01] you will be bringing your empty vessel.
[3:48:06] You don't give because you have,
[3:48:10] but you are giving by pledging an empty
[3:48:13] vessel
[3:48:15] because you want to be fil.
[3:48:20] And then it continued on. It said,
[3:48:23] "Close out everybody.
[3:48:25] Close out everybody. Close
[3:48:28] out your son, sister Rose.
[3:48:31] This is nothing about your son or your
[3:48:34] sons.
[3:48:35] It's nothing about your sister or your
[3:48:37] brother.
[3:48:39] This is about you.
[3:48:42] You need a job.
[3:48:44] You you you need a wife. You need a
[3:48:46] husband. You need to pay your rent. You
[3:48:50] need a house of your own. You you you
[3:48:52] need to petition for your children
[3:48:56] because you need a Lord.
[3:48:58] Bring your vessels
[3:49:04] and shut everybody out.
[3:49:07] Do not let someone's lack of revelation
[3:49:13] hinder your revelation
[3:49:17] inside
[3:49:20] of what God has revealed.
[3:49:22] Shut everybody out. That's when things
[3:49:25] begin to happen.
[3:49:27] Follow closely. When you shut everybody
[3:49:30] out,
[3:49:34] that's when you begin to give.
[3:49:38] Because you see, we said if you pledge 5
[3:49:41] million,
[3:49:43] we don't expect you to bring it at a
[3:49:44] goal.
[3:49:46] &gt;&gt; We expect you to bring it
[3:49:48] in small amounts
[3:49:51] every week, 50,
[3:49:54] 100,000, 200,000, as much as God shall
[3:50:01] shut everybody out and bring what you
[3:50:04] can.
[3:50:06] What you can is not coming from
[3:50:09] anywhere.
[3:50:10] It is already in you
[3:50:14] according
[3:50:16] to the grace that God has given you by
[3:50:19] revelation.
[3:50:20] When you give it as a seed,
[3:50:24] not because you have
[3:50:26] maybe I don't know but you see what you
[3:50:29] need to give the little you need to give
[3:50:32] that God has already provided for you.
[3:50:36] 2 million but maybe this week you have
[3:50:38] given 20,000
[3:50:40] and honestly in your heart
[3:50:43] this is the best you can
[3:50:46] because God provided to you and the
[3:50:49] woman began
[3:50:51] she's alone
[3:50:58] one week
[3:51:01] this now for DVF
[3:51:06] I've not known a message minister that
[3:51:07] is doing what I'm doing, but I'm doing
[3:51:09] it because the Holy Spirit has revealed
[3:51:14] and I'm a very stubborn man. When the
[3:51:17] Holy Spirit reveals to me something, I
[3:51:19] don't care what anybody.
[3:51:22] So, what I'm doing now for you is to
[3:51:25] help you
[3:51:27] understand how you are going to pay your
[3:51:30] creditors.
[3:51:32] How to activate
[3:51:34] the son of prosperity that is in you.
[3:51:38] Weak faithfully
[3:51:41] power into each body. Power into each
[3:51:44] body. Be faithful.
[3:51:47] Be diligent.
[3:51:49] Don't do it halfaphazardly.
[3:51:53] I don't have
[3:51:56] it without failure. Power in. And when
[3:52:02] you finish all your boot,
[3:52:06] nothing is going to happen
[3:52:09] before you finish powering into all the
[3:52:11] bottles you brought.
[3:52:17] Brother, you have 1.5 million bottles.
[3:52:22] Nothing will happen until you filled it
[3:52:25] up.
[3:52:28] Amen.
[3:52:30] &gt;&gt; Now, when you finish filling all your
[3:52:34] Elisha is not here,
[3:52:36] &gt;&gt; but I'm your Elisha. Now, I'm telling
[3:52:38] you, I'm instructing you what to do.
[3:52:41] Amen. Amen. Cuz I'm a servant of God,
[3:52:45] not because I'm Elisha.
[3:52:48] When you finished doing that,
[3:52:55] let us go back here.
[3:52:58] Now he says,
[3:53:00] "It came to pass the vessels were full
[3:53:04] that she said unto her son, bring me yet
[3:53:07] another vessel."
[3:53:10] You can pledge again,
[3:53:12] but you can't pledge again depending on
[3:53:14] somebody else
[3:53:17] because I'm not sure whether that will
[3:53:18] work.
[3:53:20] If you're really going to do a pledge,
[3:53:23] make it now,
[3:53:25] not later.
[3:53:27] Collect your vessels now.
[3:53:29] Not after you have seen that it works.
[3:53:33] Do it now by faith when you are in the
[3:53:36] situation you are in now.
[3:53:39] Hallelujah.
[3:53:41] And then begin powering in little by
[3:53:44] little. And after all the vessels are
[3:53:47] filled,
[3:53:49] that's when now the part of God is going
[3:53:52] to
[3:53:54] come into work.
[3:53:56] This woman has never maybe sold
[3:54:00] anything,
[3:54:04] not a business woman.
[3:54:07] She didn't know what to do. So, do you
[3:54:10] think that it was because of her
[3:54:12] salesmanship
[3:54:16] was able to sell that oil?
[3:54:21] It was a divine encounter.
[3:54:25] Now after you have finished your work,
[3:54:29] whatever you have been doing
[3:54:33] with your hands
[3:54:36] according to the word,
[3:54:38] God will begin to prosper it
[3:54:44] in levels
[3:54:46] that you, brother Enoch, has not seen
[3:54:49] before.
[3:54:52] Amen.
[3:54:53] &gt;&gt; It's up to you to take what I'm telling
[3:54:54] you,
[3:54:57] but I'm obeying the Holy Spirit.
[3:55:00] Sister Mary,
[3:55:01] &gt;&gt; I'm obeying the Holy Spirit
[3:55:04] in levels you've never not seen before,
[3:55:08] your business which was falling down.
[3:55:12] You will begin to see it
[3:55:16] reviving,
[3:55:17] reviving. And before you know it, you
[3:55:20] will pay all your creditors.
[3:55:23] Before you know it, you no longer
[3:55:25] struggle to get what to eat.
[3:55:28] Hallelujah.
[3:55:31] What I said up to now has been inspired.
[3:55:37] And as for our church
[3:55:44] and if I say anything after this,
[3:55:48] it would be my understanding of it. Let
[3:55:51] us stand on our feet.
[3:55:58] Fear the Lord
[3:56:00] all ye saints.
[3:56:03] He will give you everything.
[3:56:06] &gt;&gt; He will give you everything.
[3:56:08] If the sisters can come and help me sing
[3:56:10] it again.
[3:56:22] Amen.
[3:56:27] [Music]
[3:56:47] Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:56:50] Amen.
[3:56:52] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. If
[3:56:54] you can close your eyes and
[3:56:57] I want you to know that God answers
[3:56:59] prayer
[3:57:00] [Music]
[3:57:02] &gt;&gt; and is here with us.
[3:57:06] I did about the things you've heard.
[3:57:11] &gt;&gt; I saw the Lord
[3:57:16] and he answered me.
[3:57:20] Brother Abraham, if you can come and
[3:57:21] take a microphone.
[3:57:25] Yes, Lord.
[3:57:27] Oh Mary,
[3:57:30] [Music]
[3:57:33] those who look on him
[3:57:39] are ready.
[3:57:44] [Music]
[3:57:48] &gt;&gt; You believe that? You believe that?
[3:57:50] They'll never be ashamed.
[3:57:56] This woman cry
[3:58:00] [Applause]
[3:58:02] and the Lord had me
[3:58:07] and save me from
[3:58:12] my ene
[3:58:14] [Applause]

[3:58:24] say
[3:58:27] he will deliver.

[3:59:35] your issues, out of your problems. He's
[3:59:38] the son of prosperity.
