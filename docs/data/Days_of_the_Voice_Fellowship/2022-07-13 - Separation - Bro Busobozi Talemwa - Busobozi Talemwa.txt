[Music] [Music] is [Music] remaining amen Give the Lord a crap of praise [Music] I'd like you to go to the Book of Numbers are you welcome all of you in the name of Jesus thank you for coming chapter six we are reading from verse 1. and the Lord spoke unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when Ada and say unto them we need a man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of another right to separate themselves unto the Lord he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried all the days of his separation shall ye eat nothing that is made of vine tree from the Cannons even to the husk all the days of the vow of this separation shall nor Reza come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which is separated himself unto the Lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow all the days that he separated himself unto the Lord he shall come at no dead body he that shall make he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consecration of his God is upon his head foreign foreign amen Mina loving Jesus to you tonight we are not as holy as your word is that we might be made holy weather we desire that as we hear your word tonight we will be taken out of the way that you will speak to us and that we shall open our spiritual ears and to understand what the spirit of the Lord wants us out of my voice foreign the Bible says ask and he shall receive I believe and if you ask you shall received beside forgive me Lord we want to find you tonight when I saw your status I was like how will she come today you fought a good fight and I believe all of you have the Lord will give you Grace and this evening I'm speaking on separation I spoke on this on Wednesday on Wednesday 18th September 2013. only one person or two where there who are here today and so I thought I should uh just suffered inspired to speak on this subject again and uh I trust it will be a blessing to us I appreciate it that you don't miss any service um [Music] and I think that is recorded in heaven amen Amina how many happy tonight amen we have come here to hear his wife how many have ever separated themselves from something we all understand what separation is something very very interesting okay separation is a a must in life but today I want us to look at it in a spiritual perspective here in the Book of Numbers Moses gives the laws concerning separation I should say that the Lord spoke to Moses and he gave him laws concerning separation and this was also connected to a vow of a Nazarite if a woman or a man wanted to be to vow a vow of of being another right they had to separate themselves now we are no longer under the law of Moses but we are still under the law of God and the law of God is the word of God and if God required then for people to separate themselves I believe is still requires people now to separate themselves [Music] if God wanted then for people to be nazarites I believe even today he does right was a man or a woman that was living a consecrated life in service to God um [Music] and they did not do everything that everybody else did they were supposed to be a special group of people they were supposed to be different from others so God would give them even physical signs where people would look at them and know that this one is a Nazarite and people who are going to separate themselves to a consecrated life of service unto the Lord you know it's not an easy thing it is a difficult thing but you see it has its blessings that follow him is always a little uh favored from the Lord or by the Lord he goes ahead to describe how he our separate himself and from what um he says he will not drink wine he will not drink any strong drinks I will not drink a vinegar vinegar he will not you know drink that drink this eat peace it was very specific and he also says that even the hair now [Music] of another right and in the same way we don't drink or eat anything both physically and Also spiritually that's why we do not drink alcohol why because we are not ready that's why we keep our hair a certain ways and now today we notice in the New Testament again do you know that sister Elizabeth is not supposed to touch your head because you are not right today you should not look like a woman does not look like the rest of the world because you are not the right answer the Lord am I preaching to someone tonight and he says that all the things of that he separated himself unto the Lord shall not come to any dead body and he shall not take make himself and clean for his father or for his mother or for his brother when they died foreign if anybody loves their mother or their father or their sister or their brother more than Christ is not worthy of Christ you see we must love our family members but I must not love your family members more than you love price should be your number one priority not your wife not your husband sit back not your brother's sister Christ to all the decisions you're making in your life you should make Jesus Christ the priority Christianity then even if everyone else is not happy as long as you have made your priorities right are you following me so those were the rules the laws uh concerning separation or concerning uh being another right now in a mess like it shall be even as it was told me you notice we're going to bring them again Abraham slept Isaac Jacob they slept is are you following me tonight all the Patriots so all the the Moses they slept so much Elijah slept [Music] all these men slept but Christo did he sleep yeah he died yeah and then in here you see separation [Music] God wasn't with him the death of Christ God was not he died alone he had to suffer the absence of God in his death that we could have the presence of God in our days he said my Lord my Lord why have you for seconds says he had to suffer the absence of God in his death that we Buddha oh we would have the presence of God in our death I wouldn't Affairs all right now remember death means separation there got struck upon him our judgment and there is our judgment so many sins go before them and some follow [Music] do you want your sins to go before you or you want your sins to follow you oh you got any need of you couldn't believe it follow me you do not know then follow me let's confess hours [Applause] and Christ met our judgment Christian and God In the Garden of Eden when he pronounced straight upon the human race every human being mean separation that's the reason we call it death for one another we just separate from one another prayer now this year means separation doesn't mean to you know die is that death is not the end of something death is actually the beginning of something else means separation when he says the day you eat they are wrong thought simply you shall die it means that someday you will be separated from me separated from God because of sin or Moon because of Jesus Christ his death on the cross he was the bridge away all with separation he took the man who was separated from God and he brought him back again to the union death means separation and I'm glad that Jesus had to die because Jesus died our death yes [Music] Jesus died our day yes so that we could live his life Hallelujah [Music] in Romans chapter 6 verse 2 says God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live and no longer the rain oh God Christians must be dead people Christians must be separated a Christian means a separated can we continue in sin in unbelief of the world that the grace of God May abound he said God forbid shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein knowing no that so many of us as we have baptized into Jesus Christ we have baptized into his death like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life is did you see that today means separation and I thought it's not the beginning of something at the end of something it's the beginning of something who died with him now we have started to work on New Life and every man every woman that comes to Jesus Christ they must begin to walk the newness of Life how do you all the newness of life you cannot unless you are dead to begin with a good time working in the newness of Life unless you are dead to the old life knowing that Christ being raised from the dead there is no more everyone have you read the scripture yes because I want you to see something praise the name of the Lord sin is unbelief and if sin is unbelief do you know that the scripture clearly says that the true children of God money all right let us read it first read first John chapter 3 verse 8. and then you read also verse 9. he that committed sin is of the devil according for the devil seeneth from the beginning are you only hearing this is he that commits sin is of the devil our Accord for the devil's sins from the beginning for this purpose foreign the Son of God was manifested are you hearing me that he might destroy the works of the devil um now whatsoever is born of God chibi now I know it might look like preaching but I'm actually teaching you here chimpanzee unbelief refusing to believe what the word of God says that is the Son of God was manifested he may destroy the works of the Devils what are the works of the devil the words of the devil is unbelief and Jesus yes you died on the cross so that he can separate the children of God from unbelief for we how can we who are there to sin live there in any longer don't you know for as many of us Christo who are better than Starbucks meaning we are not alone we're no longer working in the old life that is why faith is a very important thing to the X and the Bible says never please no matter what you do brother faith in God have faith in God if you are in Christ foreign foreign [Music] let me read it this way can someone went I cannot sin since I cannot commit suicide do I have my brother or my sister here yes I mean those of you who say that you are my brothers I cannot commit sins seed remaineth in him and he cannot sing because he's born of God [Music] that's why name of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ that is born of God that means total separation where I can sing foreign if you can Rejoice because of that what will you rejoice because amen and he says likewise regarding yourself also yourselves Jesus yes die yeah and to sin A reactions because of that you know I should recall myself but alive to God through Jesus Christ do you love Jesus it is [Applause] Jesus from the Bible yes Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the very incense of our faith Christ yes amen because of him because of him overcoming death yes the Bible says because he died as if we are dead indeed not just foreign foreign let not sin therefore reign in your mother body I mean he said because you are alive unto God you know what to let means if someone knocks on your door what do you do for college you can let them in right mean now the Bible says TV all right so who was who is the boss here man since [Music] the door is yours the house is yours you know foreign if you go will gain that and find out oh it is you sin but I told you you are not welcome Hallelujah we will not let sin to reign in our motherboard girlfriend s that we will obey that we will a better last day around you know if your father tells you you need some ice cream ice it's really up to you um you need some alcohol it's up to you to say no chili girl your guy now if your body tells you brother you know you need a girlfriend you it's something to say no to the Ghana do not let sin reign in your mother body because Jesus died and we are indeed dead and sinately and vastadin says as instruments of unrighteousness all right I mean it's up to you to yield some of your members unrighteousness do not said it never tempted me do not say that foreign [Music] neither do not yield it's up to you to yield or not do not yield your members instrument foreign haha so you can decide to use your eyes your your nose your your hands you may decide to use it to instruments as instruments of unrighteousness you can decide to yield your eyes to watching that the things of the world last four things so you decide to use your eyes for that just watching uh the Hollywood stuff and things that uh are rotten again you can decide to heal your hands touching any green things to eat anything so no foreign really dollar think about it if the devil was more powerful than it means he was more powerful than Adam Adam and if he was more powerful than Adam she means he was more powerful than God the devil could not have been more powerful than him it was if we foreign and you are a believer when I hear your friends [Music] oh yeah foreign [Music] and what does the Bible say I believe neither yield you your members yes but I don't want to heal themselves why don't we have more and more gifts manifesting in the church [Music] why don't we have the book of Acts the charge of the book of Acts again in his power right foreign foreign you left on Sunday when you're on fire and you can even tell anybody who isn't even a song leader you can't even tell anyone who is somebody the brothers get up and sing um sometimes you even someone runs after the preaching of the word I have a testimony and when you give them a microphone they want to preach and then they go back at home week TV [Music] they're born again Believers but they're yielding themselves what you you do in your free time and then now you come to church production the way you yield yourself I think some of us some of you need to do some cleaning cleansing on things that you have been yielding too surely you need to do some Cleanup in your home um you know in our generation comedy has taken over um the word no longer moves them let us see with ourselves creates an atmosphere the atmosphere of God around us through that in our home in our private life every time it says for sin shall have not dominion over you it's Hallelujah amen foreign we have no the minion over here why why because we have a person who actually knows who came down and he says hey I mean he did not succeed will not be there sin will exist the difference here is a law already that rules in death your husband rules over you but if you die oh when he he dies in the same way before we found this man in Christ the nation of Jesus Christ we are not married to another foreign oh yeah and he said for sin do not have dominion over you the cheating sin is still present it should be Choice every day it has been raining on me the whole time it is [Music] they give me issues in my marriage [Applause] yes Christian [Music] from the love of Jesus Christ foreign [Applause] I am Singapore [Applause] do not have anxiety hallelujah amen yes sir he has separated us from unbelief have faith in God amen what do you want to see Faith what do you want to do for you Grace brings righteousness you see and and God wants you to have a separation actually has already done it the church but he wants you to walk into it it's all right now listen in the message Israel and the church now this may be very strong Hallelujah I mean praise the name of the Lord this may be very strong and I want you to notice are you hearing me now and I wanted to notice immediately after choice election Ronda now he is separation from everything else as soon as he called he elects then when he calls he separate you from everything that hangs onto you could be how many can say that he's still separating something that proves that it isn't a denomination it isn't two or three people together expects every individual it's an individual fair with every person so when they come in as they come in have to remind you please check for them and allow God to do that in their life it isn't because my mother there is saved it's because God trust me in Christ not you choosing yourself not your choice it's not then that would add a new page since you had nothing to do with it man when you get to see what is true you say you mean that I didn't turn to the Lord [Music] you had no way at all of turning to the Lord [Music] some of them have been doing witchcraft [Music] so you think that you are better than them you actually you were even worse than them Singapore so it's not really you cut the sick way is not what you did save your aquala you had no way at all of turning to the Lord listen to this was against God but God told you it has always been that way my old nature was against God it is foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] mm-hmm [Music] mm-hmm but um [Music] praise God praise God I'm a child [Music] you know I was in him before the foundation of the world of the Cross and someday someone told me about Jesus and someone told me about God sending a prophet in this end time is not what I'm supposed I'm the separation started I was buried in Jesus Christ and when I Rose hallelujah amen I have been living foreign [Music] because when something is foreign so and faith that is that will please go with this when I have faith
