[42:11] conference with God.
[42:16] And we all know that when they call that

[42:23] there's something crucial
[42:27] that they're going to talk about.
[42:30] Hallelujah. Amen. So if God called you

[42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; We're just going to go in the reading of
[42:56] the word.

[43:17] moons and your appointed feasts
[43:20] my soul hateth. They are a trouble unto
[43:23] me. I am very weary to bear them. And

[43:30] hide mine
[43:33] I'll hide mine eyes from you. Yeah. When

[43:50] clean. Put away the evil of your of your
[43:53] doings from before mine eyes. See to do
[43:59] evil. Learn to do well. Seek judgment.

[44:08] plead for the widow. [clears throat]
[44:10] Come now and let us reason together, uh
[44:14] sayith the Lord. Though your sins are
[44:18] though your sins be as scallet, they
[44:20] shall be as white as as snow. Though
[44:23] they may be though they be red like uh
[44:27] crimson, they will be as wool. They
[44:31] shall be as wool. If ye be willing and
[44:34] obedient, you shall eat the good of the
[44:37] land. But if you refuse and rebel, you
[44:41] shall be devoured with the sword. For
[44:44] the mouth of the Lord has spoke has
[44:47] spoken it.
[44:55] forgiven.
[45:25] Fore!
[45:39] Foreign! Foreign!
[45:47] Fore! Foreign! Foreign!
[45:58] way.
[46:17] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign
[46:17] speech.
[46:42] May the word of the Lord be blessed.
[46:44] Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can have your seats.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Today uh I just uh when I was
[46:54] praying
[46:57] I was uh God inspired me to again talk
[47:00] about rise and shine.
[47:06] This is our part two.
[47:09] But my context is
[47:12] not the simple context like
[47:17] &gt;&gt; like a a simple context of of this the
[47:21] the the title is rise and and shine
[47:27] but okay my subtitle is acceptance.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[47:35] Okay.
[47:38] Uh so
[47:44] we're just going to continue with
[47:47] rising of the sun. Rising and sh rise
[47:50] and shine. Hallelujah. You know, I've
[47:53] just been interrupted when my brother's
[47:55] gone off. So
[48:00] pray for me to deliver something for you
[48:02] this evening. Hallelujah. So like last
[48:06] time we were sharing about rise and
[48:08] shine. Hallelujah. We saw that our light
[48:12] we we get our light from the Lord that
[48:15] we also reflect shine. We are the stars
[48:18] that get the light from the sun and
[48:21] shine. Like the moon they get the light
[48:24] from the sun and shine. Hallelujah. So
[48:27] this evening I'm just uh going to talk
[48:28] about acceptance. Accepting you you
[48:31] accepting yourself to rise and shine.
[48:35] Hallelujah. I hope everyone will really
[48:38] accept to rise and shine this evening.
[48:42] The Lord here through Isaiah, he's
[48:44] really rebuking he was rebuking Judah
[48:48] and uh he was rebuking Judah and Juzarim
[48:52] because of of the coldness because of
[48:55] the situation they were in. I mean um he
[48:59] say if you if you read the whole verse
[49:02] you'll hear him saying that what purpose
[49:05] is the multitude of your sacrifice unto
[49:08] me sayith the Lord. I am full of the
[49:10] burnt I am full of the burnt offerings
[49:13] of of lambs and the fat of fed beasts
[49:16] and I I delight not in the blood of
[49:19] bullocks or of lambs or of of heigots.
[49:24] Hallelujah. So the the Lord just wants
[49:28] us to accept sometimes we are in a we
[49:32] are in a certain condition but we fail
[49:34] to accept that we are in that condition.
[49:36] Hallelujah. Sometimes we we we we we
[49:39] tend to close our eyes and say, "No, I'm
[49:42] I'm like I'm not in this. I'm not in
[49:44] this. I'm not in this. I'm just going to
[49:46] serve God." Amen. But yet, we have some
[49:49] things that are really hindering us.
[49:52] Hallelujah. That are really bringing us
[49:54] down. Amen. So, we ought to accept in
[49:58] order to rise, in order to have a
[50:00] change, you have to accept first and
[50:03] say, "Truly, I've gone astray. truly
[50:07] this is not right. You have to first
[50:09] accept it. You have to say I I know this
[50:12] is wrong. I know this is not right.
[50:15] Amina,
[50:16] &gt;&gt; I know something is not in the right uh
[50:19] position. Hallelujah.
[50:22] For you to rise again and shine. Amina,
[50:26] we are the people that are supposed to
[50:27] rise and shine this uh in this age.
[50:30] Amina, I feel so nervous, but just pray
[50:33] for me. I don't know why I'm feeling so
[50:35] nervous, but just pray for me.
[50:38] Hallelujah.
[50:40] Uh
[50:42] may God just help us because many times
[50:46] we we we fail truly to accept that we
[50:49] have gone astray.
[50:51] And yet we all want to rise and shine in
[50:55] all our endeavors, in our Christian
[50:57] lives, in our businesses, in our
[50:59] schools. You want to rise and shine in
[51:01] our businesses. want to rise and shine
[51:04] in everything want to rise and shine.
[51:06] Hallelujah. Is there anyone that does
[51:08] not want to rise and shine?
[51:11] All of us here even the ones online
[51:14] everyone even the ones in the world want
[51:16] to rise and shine. They were also some
[51:18] some want to be even better Christians.
[51:21] Aina but have failed to accept the
[51:23] condition they are in so to for for them
[51:27] to change. Amina
[51:29] may God just help us accept
[51:33] the condition and then move on. Let me
[51:36] read you some quote here. Uh brother
[51:38] Bernham was uh talking about the the
[51:40] children of Israel when they were on the
[51:42] journey to the promised land.
[51:47] The burdens of the people and the cries
[51:49] was so great till God had to had to be
[51:52] forced to call a conference. When God
[51:54] makes a decision, it's not to be that
[51:57] way. So he had already before the
[52:01] foundations of the foundation of the
[52:03] world, he had put a man on the lamb's
[52:06] book of life for the purpose of
[52:08] delivering them people. All things was
[52:11] pre-planned by God. The man's name was
[52:13] Moses, his servant. Hallelujah. So
[52:17] before the foundation of the world,
[52:19] Moses was was chos.
[52:23] And Moses had failed.
[52:25] Many of us have failed to live maybe a
[52:28] Christian life. Many of us maybe have
[52:30] failed to to break through.
[52:33] But listen to this. That should give
[52:35] give us cou this that should give us
[52:39] confidence and courage. We who have
[52:42] failed God,
[52:44] we still have hopes. We fail him as a
[52:47] church. We fail him as people. But let
[52:51] but but let's call a conference. Talk it
[52:54] over with him. See what's he what what
[52:59] he will tell us and and uh see what the
[53:02] decision we will derive at. Hallelujah.
[53:06] Let us call a conference this evening.
[53:09] You can call a conference with God.
[53:10] Amina and make things right and say, "Oh
[53:14] God, I really if your word says I'm I'm
[53:16] I'm the one going to rise and shine.
[53:18] Lord, may you make me be in my position.
[53:21] Help me be in my position. Help me
[53:24] really
[53:25] be be in my position. Hallelujah.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; May God just help us be in our
[53:31] positions. When he calls for a
[53:33] conference, he calls it as as I had
[53:36] said, he calls it when there's a crucial
[53:39] thing that he wants to discuss about.
[53:41] Hallelujah. Where his children fell in
[53:43] the garden of Eden, he called a
[53:45] conference. Amina.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; And he told they told him this one. Oh,
[53:52] Adam Adam was saying, "Oh, Eve that
[53:56] persuaded me to eat this. Oh no, the the
[53:59] the serpent." Many times we we fail
[54:01] because we we we we try to put the blame
[54:04] on people. We try to say, "Oh, this, oh
[54:07] this, oh God, oh this, oh God." But may
[54:09] we call our conference this evening to
[54:12] make things right. Hallelujah. and rise
[54:14] and shine again. Amen. I believe we are
[54:18] going to rise and shine in this
[54:19] generation. I believe what God said
[54:22] through our prophet will come to pass. I
[54:25] mean, a bride as as we talked last time,
[54:28] a bride has a short quick work. Friends,
[54:33] we are the people I want to repeat. We
[54:36] are the people going to rise and shine
[54:37] IN THIS GENERATION. YOU ARE THE PEOPLE.
[54:40] YOU you you yourself. You're the people
[54:42] going to rise and shine.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[54:45] &gt;&gt; if you just believe it, the children of
[54:48] Israel were were in Egypt suffering.
[54:52] They didn't know that they were the
[54:53] people going to bring down the armies of
[54:55] Farah. They they didn't know that there
[54:57] were a people going to bring Farah down.
[55:00] Abina,
[55:03] &gt;&gt; the devil may have caused us to have a
[55:05] stop in our lives. He may have caused us
[55:07] to have a stop in our Christian lives.
[55:09] HE MAY HAVE CAUSED us to have a stop in
[55:12] worshiping God, in really desiring to be
[55:15] more close to God,
[55:18] but you can call a conference.
[55:21] When they reached at the the Red Sea,
[55:25] they got stuck. They were hearing the
[55:28] the the horses, the armies coming.
[55:31] There's a a Red Sea. The mountains that
[55:34] are high that they could not climb, they
[55:36] were around them.
[55:39] Moses
[55:41] just went in a place. Amina, I believe
[55:44] everyone here,
[55:47] you can have your own. You can have a
[55:50] place right now. You can have a place at
[55:53] your home. And so God, I want you to
[55:55] intervene in this matter. Aina, I want
[55:58] you to intervene in this. Moses had to
[56:01] call God and they had a conference and
[56:04] he came and told the people, "Go
[56:06] forward." Hallelujah.
[56:08] He told them go forward. This evening we
[56:11] are going forward. Just accept that
[56:14] whatever the devil has brought, yes you
[56:17] may have brought it. Yes, when we look
[56:19] in our lives, you may say, "Yeah, truly
[56:21] I've been down." But today,
[56:24] it's you to accept and say, "Yes, I was
[56:27] down, but I'm no longer down."
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Amina,
[56:32] tell him this is the last day. Amina,
[56:36] &gt;&gt; there was the last day when the children
[56:38] of Israel saw the armies of Faroh the
[56:40] last time.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; We can also see our our troubles in life
[56:45] for the last time. It can happen this
[56:47] evening.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amina, you just have to believe. You
[56:51] just have to get into the presence of
[56:53] God that is here and reason with him.
[56:56] He's calling us to reason with him.
[56:58] Hallelujah. And tell him, "Oh God, ju
[57:01] just come and search my heart." I mean,
[57:04] last time we read in the in the book of
[57:05] Proverbs, we saw it is the glory of God
[57:08] to conceal a thing, to hide a thing, but
[57:10] for the kings to to search it.
[57:12] Hallelujah.
[57:13] They are precious. God says there's a
[57:17] there's a through brother Bernham, we
[57:19] said there some pressures God's God puts
[57:22] on his children. I mean, but if we put
[57:25] it to the world, they would not manage
[57:27] it. Yes, we may be under pressure. God
[57:30] sometimes puts us under pressure. so
[57:32] that to to get something from it. Aina
[57:37] don't worry of your pressures. Sometimes
[57:40] you say, "Oh God, what's this? Oh God,
[57:42] this and this. Oh God, this and this."
[57:44] But I want to tell you this evening,
[57:46] don't be worried.
[57:49] Hallelujah.
[57:51] Don't be worried.
[57:53] God is with you. God is here to address
[57:57] everything. Amen. just accept and say,
[58:01] "Oh, God, really things have not been
[58:03] good." I mean,
[58:06] we saw in the Old Testament when
[58:09] anything would go wrong, they would
[58:11] check themselves and they say, "Oh,
[58:13] what's wrong? What's wrong?" Everyone,
[58:14] they would call for a fast, they would
[58:16] do this and this, they so everything can
[58:18] be right with God. Amina, we can have a
[58:21] conference, Amina, this evening.
[58:23] Hallelujah. We see Samson when things
[58:27] turned around that he didn't expect. He
[58:31] called a conference with God. I mean, he
[58:34] called a conference with God. People may
[58:37] say that he didn't rise and shine
[58:39] because he died with his enemies, but to
[58:42] me I say he rise and shined.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; That's why we read we read about him.
[58:48] That's why we say once more Lord.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because of of Samson
[58:55] I mean he accepted his condition he said
[58:59] oh God truly I'm sorry he accepted his
[59:02] condition
[59:05] friends I do not say this maybe to to be
[59:07] judgmental but this as we said last TIME
[59:11] TO IGNITE WHAT IS in you I mean this is
[59:14] not judgmental this is not all about
[59:16] judgmental to ANYONE BUT TO IGNITE
[59:18] [screaming]
[59:19] WHAT IS IN YOU the seed that is in YOU
[59:22] HALLELUJAH THIS WORD IS preached
[59:25] to water the seed that is in you.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. This word is not to condemn any of
[59:31] God's Yes. It condemns us so that for a
[59:34] good purpose. Amen. Not to condemn us to
[59:36] bring death but to bring life.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. To help US RISE AND SHINE AGAIN AS
[59:42] CHILDREN of God.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; I declare arise and shine in THIS
[59:48] CHURCH. I DECLARE RISE AND SHINE IN YOUR
[59:51] LIFE
[59:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT IS YOURS. [screaming] IT IS
[59:54] MINE. I mean there's no one going to
[59:57] shine. It is us going to shine in this
[59:59] generation.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; When we read about other people in in
[1:00:02] other church ages, they rose and show
[1:00:05] and had to shine. Hallelujah.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; It is now our time.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; The devil cannot stop it. He's too late
[1:00:12] to stop it. Amina, it's just too late.
[1:00:19] Just call for a conference
[1:00:21] and accept.
[1:00:23] You'll see yourself rising and shining
[1:00:25] again. Hallelujah.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; It is our time. Tell your neighbor, it
[1:00:29] is your time to shine. I I don't know
[1:00:31] how best I can bring it, but it is our
[1:00:34] time to shine.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amina, you are the bride. It is there's
[1:00:39] no more time, friends. This is the end
[1:00:41] time.
[1:00:44] This is the end time. It is the time for
[1:00:47] the bride. Amina,
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that we we can just be
[1:00:53] dream. We are going to rise and shine.
[1:00:56] We are rising. There's an army rising.
[1:00:59] GOING TO SHINE GOING TO OUTSHINE THE
[1:01:01] ARMY OF THE DEVIL. HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; There's an army rising. And there's
[1:01:06] there's no like it is not anywhere like
[1:01:09] last time I told you that there's no
[1:01:12] people going to come from another planet
[1:01:14] that are the peculiar people. You are
[1:01:16] the people
[1:01:19] friends. Sometimes we when uh uh when we
[1:01:22] preach
[1:01:24] these things tend to be to normalize
[1:01:26] you. But don't make it normal to you.
[1:01:29] MAKE IT A SPECIAL MESSAGE EVERY DAY WHEN
[1:01:32] YOU HEAR IT. WHEN YOU READ THE WORD OF
[1:01:33] GOD, MAKE IT A SPECIAL message to you.
[1:01:36] Hallelujah. FOR THE WORD OF GOD IS a
[1:01:38] love letter
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; to the bride. Yes, sir.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; May you never get used of of of hearing
[1:01:46] that GOD IS MY HEALER. GOD IS MY
[1:01:48] REDEEMER. NEVER GET USED OF IT EVERY
[1:01:50] DAY. LET IT BE NEW TO YOU. AMINA,
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; may it be new to you. May it be new to
[1:01:55] me that WHEN YOU YOU HEAR OF IT, YOU GET
[1:01:58] IGNITED. YOU RISE and shine and tell the
[1:02:00] devil he has he has no way
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; I just don't want to listen to what the
[1:02:13] devil can say. Sometimes truly you are
[1:02:16] you're between the the a hard place and
[1:02:19] and a rock. You don't know what to do.
[1:02:22] BUT THERE'S A GOD THAT CAN MAKE A WAY.

[1:02:41] that when we say God is real, God is
[1:02:43] real. When we say God is here, he's
[1:02:46] truly here.
[1:02:49] We are now having a conference with God.
[1:02:52] He's checking your hearts right now.
[1:02:54] Amina,
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; just let him in. Let him in. Hallelujah.
[1:03:03] If you could just let God in and accept
[1:03:06] and say, "Oh, God, may you just come in,
[1:03:10] you'll see a change in your life."
[1:03:11] Hallelujah.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; You'll see a move in your life. I mean
[1:03:15] uh it's only God that can make a
[1:03:18] difference. I mean uh many times like we
[1:03:23] we we we put our official lights we we
[1:03:26] make our own like our own way of
[1:03:29] praising God or our own way of doing
[1:03:32] things so that we can maybe like uh make
[1:03:36] God happy. But he has said here
[1:03:41] like when he hears the the the the in
[1:03:46] the incense,
[1:03:48] they stink in his nose.
[1:03:52] The first chapter of uh of of Isaiah, he
[1:03:55] said they stink when you go back home,
[1:03:58] read that chapter. Truly, it moves the
[1:04:01] child of God. It really moves when you
[1:04:04] when you see that may your own works,
[1:04:06] your own doings
[1:04:09] m to nothing.
[1:04:12] Let's just accept God and say, "Oh God,
[1:04:14] may you come in." Hallelujah.
[1:04:17] There's an offer being given to you this
[1:04:20] evening.
[1:04:23] Hallelujah. Has we started in business
[1:04:26] uh like uh there's an offer in essential
[1:04:29] things of a contract. There's an offer.
[1:04:32] There's a consideration and an
[1:04:34] acceptance. Aina.
[1:04:37] So God is giving us an offer to rise and
[1:04:40] shine. Amina the consideration is you
[1:04:44] rising. It is the word of God being like
[1:04:48] a uh like the way they say in the the
[1:04:52] the business world they say job
[1:04:54] security. This is the security of your
[1:04:56] consideration. The word of God is the
[1:04:59] security of your consideration. I mean,
[1:05:01] you consider it because the word of God
[1:05:03] is true. He never lies. He's not a man
[1:05:06] that can lie.
[1:05:08] I mean, he's not a man that can fail
[1:05:10] when he gives you an offer that when you
[1:05:12] look at it and say, "Ah, that cannot
[1:05:14] happen.
[1:05:15] He has given it to us." A mean
[1:05:19] is not a man that you should lie.
[1:05:25] Hallelujah. is telling us this evening,
[1:05:28] may we rise and shine.
[1:05:33] May we rise and shine.
[1:05:37] If you feel it is hard for it, rise and
[1:05:39] shine. Have a conference with God.
[1:05:43] Amen. Go tell him. Sometimes we pray and
[1:05:47] we think maybe God is not hearing.
[1:05:50] We pray and pray, you cry, you think
[1:05:52] he's not hearing. He's hearing every bit
[1:05:56] of your voice, every bit of your
[1:05:58] thought.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amina,
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; whatever you're thinking now,
[1:06:05] you already he has already heard it.
[1:06:08] Amina.
[1:06:10] So when he promises in his word, it is
[1:06:12] true. Amen.
[1:06:16] Maybe we maybe some in critical moments
[1:06:20] like Samson
[1:06:23] some don't know what next some don't
[1:06:26] know what best thing they can do to
[1:06:29] persuade God
[1:06:31] to work on their issue
[1:06:33] maybe you have tried almost everything
[1:06:38] but he's calling for conference today
[1:06:43] amina
[1:06:45] is calling you
[1:06:48] through his word. You may say, "Where is
[1:06:50] God? Where is God? If he's calling me
[1:06:53] now, where is he?" He's here.
[1:06:58] Hallelujah. He's here to just have a
[1:07:01] conference with with you. You've not
[1:07:04] come here to meet a preacher.
[1:07:10] All these things that we are reading, we
[1:07:11] are not getting them from our heads. You
[1:07:14] can also go at home and read them.
[1:07:15] Everything that is here, whatever I'm
[1:07:17] reading, whatever verse I'm reading,
[1:07:19] whatever quote I may read, you can go
[1:07:21] back and read. BUT WHAT IS THE PURPOSE
[1:07:23] OF COMING HERE? WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF
[1:07:25] THIS CONFERENCE that the Lord is calling
[1:07:27] today? There is something he wants to
[1:07:29] talk about.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:33] There is something he wants to address.
[1:07:38] May you just open up your heart and may
[1:07:40] you let him address your matters.
[1:07:43] Hallelujah.
[1:07:48] Many things may have stopped us truly.
[1:07:51] Like the children of Israel,
[1:07:54] they they they called for halt
[1:07:58] because of whatever was around, because
[1:08:00] of what what the devil had brought
[1:08:02] around to instill fear in them.
[1:08:06] The devil sometimes bring things to
[1:08:08] instill fear in you.
[1:08:12] But friends, I want to tell you, don't
[1:08:15] fear.
[1:08:17] Hallelujah. I was reading Psalms uh 23.
[1:08:22] Though in the valley of death, I shall
[1:08:25] not want. I shall not want the what the
[1:08:28] devil can give me. The devil may try to
[1:08:31] give you some uh painkillers.
[1:08:35] But there's A CURE OF ALL YOUR TROUBLE.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to take a painkiller. I
[1:08:42] want to take a cure.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; I want take a cure of all your problems.
[1:08:49] Amen.
[1:08:51] There's a God that can give cure.
[1:08:54] Amen. There's a God beyond a doctor.
[1:08:59] There's a God beyond a father that can
[1:09:01] provide. There's a a God beyond a
[1:09:03] business that you have. There's a GOD
[1:09:05] BEYOND A JOB that you have.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Aina,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; we see the lady with the little oil.
[1:09:15] There's a God who can add more and more
[1:09:18] and more. Hallelujah.
[1:09:22] Is you are having to accept accept the
[1:09:25] offer that the Lord is giving you.
[1:09:28] Accept it with all your heart. Amina
[1:09:32] sometimes we accept and want God to act
[1:09:36] in a way that we want
[1:09:40] but God has his provided way in
[1:09:43] everything.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a provided way in each
[1:09:47] one's lives. The way he provides me he
[1:09:49] may not provide you like that. The way
[1:09:51] he provides an he may not provide to to
[1:09:54] you like that.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:57] Everyone
[1:10:00] has a way God deals with them. Amina
[1:10:04] I do not say these things because they
[1:10:06] have been said.
[1:10:09] I do not talk about them that because
[1:10:11] other preachers have TALKED ABOUT THEM.
[1:10:13] I'VE SEEN them happening. Hallelujah.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; If you've not seen them happening in
[1:10:19] your life, seeing God making a way where
[1:10:22] there's no way. You may have read about
[1:10:24] the children of Israel that God just
[1:10:26] split the sea so they can have a way.
[1:10:30] But God has split many seas in our
[1:10:32] lives. Amen. But we we just we just want
[1:10:36] to see it in our own ways. But God has
[1:10:39] splitted many. Amen.
[1:10:44] God has worked in our lives many times.
[1:10:47] But because we are blinded by what the
[1:10:50] world says by by what maybe what you
[1:10:53] think you fail to see what God is doing
[1:10:57] in your life. I mean we always see what
[1:11:00] God has done before and we are always
[1:11:02] hoping of what God is going to do but we
[1:11:04] FAIL TO SEE WHAT God is doing in our
[1:11:07] lives.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; I want to challenge you. God hasn't God
[1:11:14] been faithful today?
[1:11:18] I can despise that God has been
[1:11:20] faithful.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; You know the people that are not even
[1:11:25] dead, the ones that are bedridden now
[1:11:30] many
[1:11:32] last time I was sharing Sunday school
[1:11:34] when you watch news you see people
[1:11:37] suffering.
[1:11:38] Sometimes I look at myself I say I have
[1:11:40] not yet suffered. You look at people in
[1:11:43] Arab countries suffering. in wars
[1:11:49] every day of their lives. They don't
[1:11:51] have a house. They don't have food. Even
[1:11:54] if they have the money, it will not help
[1:11:56] them.
[1:12:00] But have you thought of what God has
[1:12:02] done in your life?
[1:12:04] Have you thought of the peace that God
[1:12:06] has given in your life?
[1:12:09] Amina may God just help us
[1:12:13] accept his provided way and rise and
[1:12:16] shine once again.
[1:12:19] Amina because we shall not shine the way
[1:12:22] the world may think that we are going to
[1:12:24] shine. That's the truth. Don't wait to
[1:12:27] to shine. Maybe some people think that
[1:12:30] uh having uh like property, having uh
[1:12:34] like uh these worldly things maybe land
[1:12:38] what those are the blessings.
[1:12:42] The best blessing that God can give you
[1:12:44] is salvation.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; All these things shall pass away.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amina if you HAVE THE SALVATION RISE AND
[1:12:55] SHINE.
[1:12:56] AINA PORTRAY THAT LIGHT THAT IS in you.
[1:13:00] It is not your light that is shining.
[1:13:03] It's God's light.
[1:13:05] Aina
[1:13:08] just accept God's provided way. Amen.
[1:13:13] And you'll see the light shining in your
[1:13:16] life.
[1:13:17] Hallelujah. We have seen God's children
[1:13:21] in different ways shining in their
[1:13:24] lives.
[1:13:26] The people, all the people we read about
[1:13:28] in the Bible,
[1:13:30] that is the shining I'm talking about.
[1:13:34] Hallelujah.
[1:13:35] Bringing out what you're supposed to
[1:13:38] bring out.
[1:13:40] Aina,
[1:13:43] the fruits of God in you. Hina, that's
[1:13:48] what is called shining.
[1:13:51] Aina when you see a a a a flower when it
[1:13:56] comes out and blossoms
[1:13:58] it is shining in its nature. What nature
[1:14:02] are we in? The nature of God.
[1:14:06] Amen. So we ought to shine like God.
[1:14:13] Sometimes we we come here and sing to be
[1:14:15] like Jesus.
[1:14:19] We always sing it and he jump, he
[1:14:22] danced.
[1:14:24] But have you ever thought of what Jesus
[1:14:26] was when he was a man?
[1:14:30] Have you ever thought about it? But in
[1:14:33] who like
[1:14:36] who is the greatest celebrity in this
[1:14:38] world that his name has been moving ages
[1:14:42] and ages and ages and ages? It is not
[1:14:45] the rich man that was there 2,000 years
[1:14:47] ago.
[1:14:49] It is Jesus that we are still talking
[1:14:51] about.
[1:14:54] That's what they call shining.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Accept God's provided way of shining.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; And move on with with your life.
[1:15:09] The Jesus want to be like to be like to
[1:15:11] be like he didn't have a house.
[1:15:17] Have I lied
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; yet? He has everything.
[1:15:28] Hallelujah.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; But we desire to be like him and is the
[1:15:33] light that we are drawing to be like
[1:15:35] him.
[1:15:37] Amen.
[1:15:39] May we just accept
[1:15:41] of God's provided way. Aina
[1:15:47] your light may be small
[1:15:49] but is what God has given you.
[1:15:52] Hallelujah.
[1:15:55] May we just uh giving ourselves just
[1:15:58] surrender everything and uh and call God
[1:16:03] if maybe you failed to see the light
[1:16:06] because of the things that have blinded
[1:16:08] you because of the things that are
[1:16:11] that are that are around you. I want you
[1:16:14] to just see the light uh this evening.
[1:16:17] The light of God that we always talk
[1:16:19] about
[1:16:24] is calling you
[1:16:26] to accept and rise and shine. He's
[1:16:30] giving you an offer. Let me read you
[1:16:33] this quotation
[1:16:35] uh here in the message. What think ye of
[1:16:38] Christ? It was preached in 1950 57. It
[1:16:43] says now a pardon is not a pardon unless
[1:16:48] it is accepted as a pardon. I I I I read
[1:16:52] I read an act I read an act some time
[1:16:55] ago where where that there was a man in
[1:16:58] the east eastern country. It had been
[1:17:00] many years ago since the incident
[1:17:02] happened. But the man was guilty and uh
[1:17:05] uh was guilty and was sentenced to death
[1:17:08] and a firing squad and some good man
[1:17:12] went to work and worked around the the
[1:17:14] governor of the state until finally they
[1:17:17] persuaded the governor to spare the life
[1:17:19] of the person. And when the guilty p the
[1:17:22] the guilty person who was really guilty
[1:17:25] was set free to get another chance to
[1:17:27] bring himself upon to bring himself up
[1:17:31] and make a and and make make a citizen.
[1:17:34] When the man
[1:17:36] uh come with the pardon, the man was was
[1:17:40] to die, refused to receive it.
[1:17:44] He did not want it.
[1:17:46] Yet the governor had his name signed
[1:17:49] pardoned.
[1:17:51] Amina,
[1:17:53] what makes what what made the difference
[1:17:56] was the governor's name and the pardon.
[1:18:02] It spelled pardon to the man. If he
[1:18:05] wanted to receive it, but if he did not
[1:18:08] want to receive it, he had to pay the
[1:18:11] penalty. Aina and the man refused it and
[1:18:16] said, "I do not believe it. I will not
[1:18:19] accept it.
[1:18:22] And the man was shot the following day.
[1:18:25] Then this pardon goes back to the
[1:18:27] governor and he had pardoned the man yet
[1:18:29] he had he was a corpse.
[1:18:32] Then it was it it was tried in the the
[1:18:35] Supreme Court of the land and it was
[1:18:38] declared that a pardon is not a pardon
[1:18:40] unless it is accepted. And salvation
[1:18:43] through Jesus Christ is not salvation
[1:18:46] unless it IS ACCEPTED AS SALVATION. OH,
[1:18:49] IF THE WORLD COULD ONLY LOOK ON God's
[1:18:52] greatest promises and believe them that
[1:18:55] they they are God's burden to the human
[1:18:57] race. AMEN. GOD IS BURDENING US. AINA
[1:19:02] FOR YOU TO RISE AND shine in your
[1:19:05] Christian life TO RISE AND SHINE IN YOUR
[1:19:07] all your endeavors.
[1:19:10] Amen.
[1:19:11] But we have failed to accept it. We have
[1:19:14] failed.
[1:19:16] He's saying the consideration was the
[1:19:18] name
[1:19:20] and the burden.
[1:19:23] He's giving us an a an offer.
[1:19:28] Aina
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; and he's putting a consideration that
[1:19:31] consider this
[1:19:34] but your part is to accept that's why
[1:19:36] God created a man on free moral agency
[1:19:40] it's to accept I said I believe it I'll
[1:19:44] go with it
[1:19:48] all the way all the way
[1:19:52] I've drawn the line I will goina
[1:19:59] And when decide when you make such a
[1:20:02] decision,
[1:20:05] let me tell you friends, there's not
[1:20:06] always even your energy or your your by
[1:20:09] your own uh doing that you're going to
[1:20:11] rise and shine. It's just you making up
[1:20:14] a decision and say whatever comes I'm
[1:20:17] going to rise AND SHINE BECAUSE GOD HAS
[1:20:19] SAID IT, it is a finished work.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] is a finished work. Look at the thief at
[1:20:29] a cross.
[1:20:31] He accepted that I was a thief.
[1:20:34] He said, "But remember me.
[1:20:37] It's just a matter of accepting.
[1:20:40] Accept your condition. If don't try to
[1:20:43] play Christianity
[1:20:46] because you'll not play it forever,
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; you're going to fail.
[1:20:52] You're going to fail if you play
[1:20:53] Christianity.
[1:20:55] You may hide. You may say, "Now I'm out
[1:20:58] of I'm now at school or I'm now at uh
[1:21:01] maybe I'm with my friends. They don't
[1:21:02] know that I'm a believer. So, I can do
[1:21:05] whatever I want."
[1:21:07] Some I will see you.
[1:21:11] Amina
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; and and will be recorded
[1:21:15] and when the last conference comes
[1:21:18] everything will be brought out which is
[1:21:21] the judgment day. Friends I I do not
[1:21:24] preach this or I do not want to give you
[1:21:26] this message. I don't want you to take
[1:21:28] it as a judgmental message. It may seem
[1:21:31] so condemning but I I just want to take
[1:21:34] it as a message that can ignite your
[1:21:37] soul. Amina that will make you accept
[1:21:40] what God can do in your life.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amina,
[1:21:46] this message can do it. It has done it
[1:21:49] before. It is doing it now and is going
[1:21:52] to do it after.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; The word of God is the same yesterday,
[1:21:58] today, and forever.
[1:22:00] Hallelujah. It only takes you to believe
[1:22:03] it.
[1:22:06] Amina, it is our season to believe God's
[1:22:09] word.
[1:22:12] There's no more other seasons coming.
[1:22:14] This is the season.
[1:22:19] If you're expecting another one,
[1:22:22] my brother, you'll be a preacher in the
[1:22:24] tribulation.
[1:22:30] If you can't do anything for God this
[1:22:32] moment, if you can't accept God,
[1:22:35] you'll try to accept him in tribulation
[1:22:37] when you cannot even because of the
[1:22:40] conditions that will be there.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; This is our time to rise and shine.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD DECLARES
[1:22:48] THAT WE are rising and shining. An army
[1:22:51] is rising and shining.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:59] An army is rising and shining.
[1:23:04] You may think these are just words, but
[1:23:07] these are not my words. I have no even
[1:23:08] authority to tell you my words
[1:23:12] when I'm behind the desk.
[1:23:15] These are the what God has put on my
[1:23:18] heart.
[1:23:20] When God wants to give a message,
[1:23:23] he has a mouthpiece.
[1:23:27] Today he may use me. Tomorrow he may use
[1:23:29] Dixon. Next time he may use Aranius.
[1:23:32] Next time he may use Brother Martin. He
[1:23:34] may use Joel. He may use anyone.
[1:23:39] Hallelujah.
[1:23:41] It is as accepting.
[1:23:44] Aina. An offer is given to us.
[1:23:48] An offer is given to everyone.
[1:23:52] Hallelujah.
[1:23:56] Brother Abraham here in redemption by
[1:23:58] power. He said,
[1:24:01] "All right,
[1:24:03] put on your shock proof jackets."
[1:24:06] Now, this is uh not for
[1:24:10] for someone that uh
[1:24:14] still shaking shaking, but he's saying,
[1:24:17] "Put on shockproof jackets." Hallelujah.
[1:24:22] Here it comes. Look, every man that
[1:24:26] rejects lights, that rejects light, goes
[1:24:31] blind and walks in darkness. Because you
[1:24:34] do not accept light.
[1:24:36] Amen. God sends ministers that preach
[1:24:40] the gospel. He sends signs and wonders
[1:24:42] among men to vindicate it to be the
[1:24:45] truth.
[1:24:47] And men reject it.
[1:24:53] There is nothing left but DARKNESS FOR
[1:24:55] YOU. WALK in the light while the light
[1:24:58] is shining.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; My brother, receive the light.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Christ is the light.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; He is coming to bring the light to you.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; But those who reject light re receive
[1:25:14] darkness.
[1:25:16] And every man and woman tonight who
[1:25:19] rejects light, walks in darkness, NOT
[1:25:21] KNOWING WHERE HE IS GOING,
[1:25:25] is staggering
[1:25:31] again.
[1:25:37] is staggering
[1:25:39] along pretty good popular with the
[1:25:42] people but wonder stands in the presence
[1:25:45] of God.
[1:25:48] We go around with people want to be
[1:25:52] attached
[1:25:54] with like popular people, famous people.
[1:25:58] You want to be
[1:26:00] some guy that will be talked about,
[1:26:04] but that is not the light that we are
[1:26:06] talking about.
[1:26:08] Amina, that's just darkness.
[1:26:15] You're just looking at darkness.
[1:26:18] Amina,
[1:26:24] may we accept the light.
[1:26:28] Because we do not light our own light.
[1:26:30] We reflect the light of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:38] I don't want to tell you that you're
[1:26:39] going to be talked about
[1:26:42] in this world that you like that nah
[1:26:46] that is the light. Ah
[1:26:50] some will even reject it. They say that
[1:26:52] can never be the light.
[1:26:56] Hallelujah.
[1:26:58] But the light Jesus Christ is shining
[1:27:01] today.
[1:27:03] He's shining today. May you accept him
[1:27:06] to shine in your life.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Aina accept him today.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Your light may be dim.
[1:27:19] Aina,
[1:27:21] but he's here to pardon us.
[1:27:26] Let us just accept the pattern that he
[1:27:28] has given us.
[1:27:38] May we accept it.
[1:27:49] It is not to say yeah
[1:27:55] my friends sometimes gets rough
[1:28:01] but when it gets rough what I I know and
[1:28:04] I believe
[1:28:07] that God always makes a way. He provides
[1:28:09] a way for your for for for for your
[1:28:11] safety for your survival.
[1:28:15] Amina
[1:28:17] you you think Stefan would just bear the
[1:28:19] death like stoning him as a man? There
[1:28:23] is something
[1:28:27] that enabled him to endure.
[1:28:32] Hallelujah. There is something that
[1:28:34] enabled Jesus Christ to endure the
[1:28:37] cross.
[1:28:40] He was a man, 100% a man and 100% God,
[1:28:48] a man dying for you.
[1:28:52] Amen. So that our light can shine.
[1:28:56] Hallelujah.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; May God just help us to make the light
[1:29:01] shine in our lives.
[1:29:06] There's an offer
[1:29:08] tonight.
[1:29:12] There's an offer for everyone
[1:29:16] to rise and shine.
[1:29:19] Rise and shine all the bride.
[1:29:22] Hallelujah.
[1:29:24] Here in the seven church ages,
[1:29:27] brother Bernham says,
[1:29:29] "Oh church of the living God, RISE AND
[1:29:34] SHINE." LOOK, you don't realize I wish I
[1:29:37] had some kind of a shock that I could
[1:29:41] give you somehow. I wish THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:29:45] COULD COME IN HIS GREAT POWER and move
[1:29:48] you to a place THAT YOU WOULD GRAB THE
[1:29:50] BIBLE AND SAY, "Let me look into this."
[1:29:54] When you see nations are breaking,
[1:29:56] Israel awake are awakening the signs
[1:29:59] that that the Bible for told Gentile's
[1:30:01] day is numbered.
[1:30:05] Hallelujah. Return or despise
[1:30:09] or dispass to your own. Hallelujah. The
[1:30:12] redemption, the day of redemption is
[1:30:14] near. Hallelujah. But our hearts are
[1:30:17] failing for fear. We fear to li to to
[1:30:21] rise and shine. Aina,
[1:30:25] may we trim our lamps clear and rise and
[1:30:28] shine.
[1:30:30] Hallelujah.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; May God just help us rise and shine.
[1:30:36] Amina,
[1:30:38] may this word just be like a spank.
[1:30:40] Brother Bam talks about a a baby that
[1:30:43] was born and the baby seemed to be dead.
[1:30:45] They they hold the legs and they have to
[1:30:48] give him some slaps for the baby to
[1:30:50] again breathe and have life. I MEAN THIS
[1:30:54] WORD may be that spank in your life.
[1:30:59] You can apply it yourself right now by
[1:31:02] accepting
[1:31:04] that I want to rise and shine. I want to
[1:31:07] rise and shine in this generation.
[1:31:11] Just accept
[1:31:13] those banks. That's why they make they
[1:31:16] make a baby even to cry that somehow
[1:31:17] they're painful. The word sometimes
[1:31:19] comes when it is painful when it will
[1:31:22] let you live very many things.
[1:31:26] If you read the the history of the
[1:31:28] Bible, people gave in their lives
[1:31:32] to make this light shine.
[1:31:36] If you look at the way they killed
[1:31:38] people,
[1:31:41] they hung them upside down. They cut
[1:31:43] them. They divide them
[1:31:49] for this light to shine so we can have a
[1:31:52] testimony.
[1:31:54] Hallelujah.
[1:31:58] Let me tell you friends
[1:32:01] even the the riches of this world
[1:32:05] those are just uh God just adds them to
[1:32:08] us
[1:32:09] but it's not the main thing
[1:32:12] we see even brother Benham says uh 80%
[1:32:16] or 90% of Jesus's ministry they were
[1:32:19] like healing
[1:32:22] doing miracles
[1:32:24] but he had a message through them
[1:32:28] after they were used to attract other
[1:32:31] people so that he can deliver a message.
[1:32:34] Amen.
[1:32:38] Sometimes God gives us blessings in life
[1:32:41] but the same blessings that
[1:32:44] the the things that he has given us they
[1:32:46] sometimes the ones that hind us
[1:32:50] and you say oh I'm busy all this all
[1:32:52] this
[1:32:57] and instead of lighting for you you may
[1:32:59] think you're lighting but you're dimina
[1:33:06] But child of God, you can rise and
[1:33:08] shine. Hallelujah. It is our time to
[1:33:12] rise and shine friends. It's our time.
[1:33:16] There's no more time. I don't know how
[1:33:18] how many times I can speak it, but it's
[1:33:21] our time.
[1:33:23] If it is not your time, if you think
[1:33:24] this is not your, it is my time to rise
[1:33:27] and shine and reflect my God.
[1:33:32] Amina
[1:33:34] when I s me being my time to rise and
[1:33:37] shine. It's not that you're going to
[1:33:39] hear my name everywhere that D is this
[1:33:42] and oh Danny.
[1:33:45] No,
[1:33:47] sometimes even there are many stars that
[1:33:49] are shining.
[1:33:52] Many stars that are shining right now in
[1:33:56] glory that you didn't even hear of.
[1:34:00] Just you had their works.
[1:34:04] I mean, you had their works. Yes.
[1:34:06] Sometimes you can hear the names.
[1:34:09] Hallelujah. Which is not bad.
[1:34:14] A mean.
[1:34:16] May we not call for sometimes we we we
[1:34:19] we when we call for for help to a stop
[1:34:23] that when things are are heavy on us
[1:34:26] sometimes we stop for long.
[1:34:29] AINA BUT IN GOD there's no stopping for
[1:34:33] long.
[1:34:35] I not say that sometimes we don't stop
[1:34:37] in our journey
[1:34:39] as we see the children of Israel.
[1:34:41] Sometimes things get rough and you stop
[1:34:44] and you feel weary and it's all God what
[1:34:48] next can I do?
[1:34:51] But in a
[1:34:54] God gives you strength and you move
[1:34:57] again. Hallelujah. When you stop for
[1:35:00] long, the devil will give you his ideas.
[1:35:03] A mean
[1:35:06] he will give you the the ways that maybe
[1:35:08] may make you feel better, but I'm
[1:35:11] telling you, he's just giving you
[1:35:12] painkillers.
[1:35:15] But there's a cure of everything.
[1:35:19] Hallelujah.
[1:35:21] May we accept
[1:35:24] Amina
[1:35:25] and reflect the light of our God.
[1:35:29] Hallelujah.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; In the message, the great shining light.
[1:35:35] Brother Bam asked a question. What are
[1:35:38] we to do then to rise and shine?
[1:35:42] Amen.
[1:35:44] Rise and shine the light of God to to
[1:35:47] the to the dying in the darkness of this
[1:35:51] world. We are to reflect the to reflect
[1:35:54] the shine the shine
[1:35:57] and to reflect and shine the presence of
[1:36:00] the Lord Jesus
[1:36:02] in his uh resurrection power.
[1:36:04] Hallelujah.
[1:36:06] He is yesterday
[1:36:08] so he is today to reflect him.
[1:36:12] Hallelujah. But remember then the star
[1:36:16] again when it is it's it finished it
[1:36:19] finished its course. It takes no honor.
[1:36:24] Hallelujah.
[1:36:25] They start just brought the men to their
[1:36:29] destination. Aina and showed them the
[1:36:32] perfect light.
[1:36:35] And we as members of the body of Christ
[1:36:38] this even this morning he preached it in
[1:36:41] the morning but this evening friends we
[1:36:44] are God's light but we take no honor to
[1:36:48] ourselves.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] When we have got out, when we have got
[1:36:55] our patient
[1:36:57] and our person that we are leading, when
[1:37:00] we have got them, we must disown
[1:37:03] ourselves and lead them to the great and
[1:37:06] perfect light which shine
[1:37:09] to light the way of every man that
[1:37:11] cometh in the world into the world.
[1:37:14] Hallelujah. The Lord Jesus Christ, not a
[1:37:17] myth called Santa uh Santa Claus,
[1:37:22] not some church by denomination, but the
[1:37:26] true and perfect light, Jesus Christ,
[1:37:29] the son of the living God. Hallelujah.
[1:37:33] We approaching even Christmas. You'll
[1:37:36] hear the Santa Santa Santa Claus, Father
[1:37:39] Christmas, what and what
[1:37:43] everyone will maybe want to to have him
[1:37:45] in the house. What and what?
[1:37:48] Hallelujah. But here, brother Bernham is
[1:37:50] telling us that our Jesus is not the
[1:37:53] Santa Claus. Hallelujah.
[1:37:56] that when we bring people when we are
[1:37:59] leading people Aina
[1:38:04] lead them to the great light
[1:38:07] the star does not bring honor to
[1:38:09] themselves I mean maybe when God has has
[1:38:13] given you a chance to have a testimony
[1:38:14] that you're going to give the bride
[1:38:19] some people may think that the ones that
[1:38:20] made it
[1:38:23] a testimony that God gives you it is to
[1:38:25] edify ify the body of Christ not to
[1:38:29] bring honor to you but to bring honor to
[1:38:32] God. Hallelujah. And then you the light
[1:38:36] shining. Hallelujah.
[1:38:39] When Jesus rises and shines in your
[1:38:42] life, when he rises because of you and
[1:38:45] he shines in someone's life, then all of
[1:38:47] you are doing what? A rising and
[1:38:49] shining. Hallelujah. Because we believe
[1:38:52] that we are the body and Jesus is the
[1:38:54] head.
[1:38:55] Aina
[1:38:59] May we enable may we pray so much that
[1:39:02] God can help us
[1:39:04] and let the light shine in our lives.
[1:39:07] Amenina
[1:39:09] may God just help us. May God just help
[1:39:12] everyone.
[1:39:14] Hallelujah.
[1:39:17] If you want, if you hunger for God, if
[1:39:20] you want God more close to you, he's
[1:39:23] here.
[1:39:26] He's giving you an offer,
[1:39:29] it is you to accept it.
[1:39:32] Hallelujah. For you to rise and shine.
[1:39:40] Hallelujah.
[1:39:44] I think my time is almost up. Let us
[1:39:46] read this quotation.
[1:39:50] And uh like uh
[1:39:53] for let me tell you I'm going to speak
[1:39:56] of the last conference
[1:40:00] will ever be held.
[1:40:02] Aina
[1:40:05] this is not the last conference. Even if
[1:40:08] Jesus has to come today or after this
[1:40:12] service, this is not the last
[1:40:13] conference.
[1:40:15] I want to tell you that there's another
[1:40:16] conference, the last one that will be
[1:40:19] held. Hallelujah.
[1:40:22] God be merciful. Only one thing will
[1:40:25] stand there reconciled. That's the
[1:40:28] judgment.
[1:40:30] And the only thing you will be
[1:40:32] reconciled by is when you are you you
[1:40:34] have accepted the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:37] as your pardon and been filled with his
[1:40:41] spirit. There's a conference where every
[1:40:45] man will meet, every woman will meet,
[1:40:48] every child will meet.
[1:40:52] Children you've had you'll also be
[1:40:54] there.
[1:40:57] There's a place selected where the
[1:40:59] conference will be held
[1:41:02] and there will be a great white throne
[1:41:04] judgment set. God has permitted his
[1:41:07] prophets to look in and say the the
[1:41:10] books were opened and another book which
[1:41:14] is the book of life 10,000 times 10 thou
[1:41:18] 10,000 of ministers and angels minister
[1:41:21] to him. Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] Then it was written, if the righteous be
[1:41:28] scarcely saved, where will the sinner
[1:41:31] and ungodly appear? What will be your
[1:41:34] stand at the conference?
[1:41:38] You'll have you will have bypassed all
[1:41:41] of them. This is one of the conference
[1:41:43] you may have bypassed.
[1:41:46] But I believe God has given us a chance.
[1:41:49] He has given us a chance to accept and
[1:41:52] have a conference with him.
[1:41:54] Aina and have a conference with him.
[1:42:00] Hallelujah.
[1:42:03] Huh? You might have bypassed all of them
[1:42:07] down through your life.
[1:42:09] You may walk out of this door this
[1:42:12] morning. He preached it in the morning.
[1:42:15] But you may walk out this evening and
[1:42:17] bypass this one.
[1:42:19] But my friend, you will never bypass
[1:42:22] that one. You are going to be there for
[1:42:25] it was once appointed onto men to die.
[1:42:30] But after that, the judgment there will
[1:42:34] be there will be the great conference
[1:42:37] where we will all stand together and we
[1:42:41] will all have an account for this
[1:42:43] morning for this evening
[1:42:46] of this earthly conference.
[1:42:48] that we have held.
[1:42:50] Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] We have had a conference.
[1:42:55] Friends, it is our duty as the bride to
[1:42:57] rise and shine.
[1:42:59] Amina, may we rise and shine.
[1:43:04] Amina,
[1:43:07] our fathers, the four believers had rise
[1:43:10] and shine. Our prophet had rise and
[1:43:14] shine.
[1:43:17] Hallelujah. When I say he had to rise
[1:43:19] and shine, it is not that his name is
[1:43:21] known all over that many people know him
[1:43:25] but he reflected Jesus Christ in his
[1:43:27] life. Amen. So it is our duty to rise
[1:43:31] and shine friends.
[1:43:34] Hallelujah. As the musicians are coming,
[1:43:39] I want to tell you
[1:43:41] it is my duty. It is your duty to rise
[1:43:45] and shine.
[1:43:47] Hallelujah. We have heard the word.
[1:43:54] Everything most of the things I've read
[1:43:56] so much today.
[1:43:59] Amina
[1:44:02] and most of what I've been saying the
[1:44:03] scriptures.
[1:44:07] We have heard that the word is is
[1:44:08] calling us
[1:44:10] rise and shine. Accept
[1:44:13] rise and shine.
[1:44:16] Amina,
[1:44:18] I want to remind you, you're not going
[1:44:20] to shine by yourself,
[1:44:24] but by the light, by the sun, Jesus
[1:44:27] Christ.
[1:44:29] Hallelujah. Last time we heard that we
[1:44:32] are going to rise and shine because of
[1:44:35] we are ignited by the word of God. Amen.
[1:44:39] The word of God is again igniting us.
[1:44:49] You cannot you cannot even let this
[1:44:52] night pass
[1:44:57] that you can say ah ah enough is enough
[1:45:06] that you can say
[1:45:09] enough is Enough
[1:45:15] friends. This word calls us all of us to
[1:45:17] rise and shine.
[1:45:21] Aina
[1:45:23] to rise and reflect our God.
[1:45:30] We have had artificial lights in our
[1:45:32] lives.
[1:45:36] Maybe we have pretended enough
[1:45:40] to try to light.
[1:45:46] But there's a true
[1:45:49] light going to shine
[1:45:54] that is shining now that is going to
[1:45:56] shine after
[1:45:59] which is Jesus Christ.
[1:46:03] And if you're attached to him,
[1:46:05] I want to tell you, you're going to rise
[1:46:06] and shine also.
[1:46:10] Hallelujah.
[1:46:13] The devil thought that Jesus Christ was
[1:46:15] doomed when he he killed him at the
[1:46:18] cross,
[1:46:19] but he never knew
[1:46:22] that that was the moment that Jesus was
[1:46:25] going was rising to shine.
[1:46:28] Hallelujah.
[1:46:30] The devil may have stripped you
[1:46:33] thinking, "God, this one is done.
[1:46:36] He may have taken almost everything.
[1:46:41] But he has forgotten that there's a man
[1:46:43] that turns on the light. And that man is
[1:46:47] right here.
[1:46:50] If you want to turn on your light, if
[1:46:52] you want to rise and shine, the man that
[1:46:55] turns on the light is here.
[1:47:02] Friends, I do not speak these things
[1:47:04] because I've read the message or because
[1:47:05] I've heard the message.
[1:47:08] But is a conviction that I feel, it is
[1:47:10] an inspiration that I feel on my heart
[1:47:12] to tell you people, if you just accept
[1:47:16] it.
[1:47:19] There's no more time, friends.
[1:47:23] Do whatever you can.
[1:47:40] Do whatever you can.
[1:47:58] You can accept now and say, "Oh God,
[1:48:03] maybe things have these worldly things
[1:48:06] have made us so busy
[1:48:09] that have caused our light to dim."
[1:48:14] But I want to remind you,
[1:48:18] you are the people that are going to
[1:48:19] light here in Nongo.
[1:48:24] Hallelujah.
[1:48:25] You're the people that are lighting.
[1:48:28] Different churches are stationed in
[1:48:30] different places around the country.
[1:48:34] They're lighting, lighting, lighting.
[1:48:39] Amina
