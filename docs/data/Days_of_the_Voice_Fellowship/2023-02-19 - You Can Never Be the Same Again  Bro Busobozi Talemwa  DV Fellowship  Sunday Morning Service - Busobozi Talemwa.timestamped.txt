[11:18] Acts chapter 4.
[11:40] Can Can we do English only today? Sister
[11:42] Grace.
[11:46] Sister Martha, can we do English only
[11:49] today? Sister Agatha, what do you think?
[11:53] All right. Uh most of the people here
[11:54] are educated really. But uh we interpret
[11:58] for you to get clarity if you hear in
[12:00] your own language and also uh for the
[12:03] online audience. But I think let let us
[12:06] let the brother rest. I feel it is not
[12:09] good to strain him when he's not well.
[12:11] What do you think?
[12:13] Amen. So let us uh go to the book of
[12:16] Acts chapter 4 verse 13 and and see how
[12:19] the Lord will lead us this morning.
[12:29] I'm reading verses 13.
[12:33] Brother Seagawa, are you perfectly okay
[12:35] with English?
[12:37] No. Uganda.
[12:40] Okay. So, brother brother, you might
[12:43] want you you can sit with him. Okay. All
[12:45] right. And sometimes I might also go in
[12:47] Uganda. Okay. Chapter 4:E3.
[12:52] Okay. We can begin a little bit up. Acts
[12:55] chapter 4. Uh let us begin from five
[12:58] actually and then we shall end with 13.
[13:01] And it came to pass on their rulers and
[13:03] elders and scribes and Annus the high
[13:06] priest and Caiaphas and John and
[13:09] Alexander and as many as were of the
[13:11] kindred of the high priest were gathered
[13:14] together at Jerusalem. And when they had
[13:17] set them in the mid east, they asked,
[13:20] "By what power or by what name have ye
[13:24] done this?"
[13:27] Then Peter filled
[13:29] uh with the Holy Ghost said unto them,
[13:32] "Ye rulers of the people and elders of
[13:35] Israel, if we this day by be examined of
[13:38] the good deed done to the important man,
[13:42] by what means he is made whole, be it
[13:46] known unto you all, and to all the
[13:48] people of Israel, that by the name of
[13:50] Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you
[13:53] crucified, whom God raised from the
[13:55] dead, even by him does this man stand by
[13:58] here uh before you all. This is the
[14:02] stone which was set at note of you
[14:05] builders which is become the head of the
[14:08] corner. Amen. Brother Martin, can you
[14:10] come up here? Neither is there
[14:12] salvation. Now look at verse 12 and
[14:14] verse 13. Neither is there salvation in
[14:17] any other for there is none other name
[14:19] under heaven given among men whereby we
[14:22] must be saved. Now when they saw the
[14:26] boldness of Peter and John and perceived
[14:30] that they were unlanded and ignorant
[14:33] men,
[14:35] they marveled
[14:37] and they took knowledge of them that
[14:40] they had been with Jesus. Let us pray.
[14:44] our precious loving Jesus that the
[14:46] portion we have read out of the book of
[14:48] acts.
[14:49] These as we know that a prophet tells us
[14:52] was not just acts of the apostles but
[14:54] these are acts of the holy spirit in the
[14:57] apostles and lord I know that these acts
[15:00] of the holy spirit did not end with the
[15:02] apostles. They are continually going to
[15:05] be manifested among people that receive
[15:08] the holy spirit and those that fear and
[15:10] love your name and preach and speak and
[15:12] live in your name. Lord, we know that we
[15:14] also here this morning a are people that
[15:17] believe in your name. And we want to see
[15:19] the same God that these people saw. We
[15:21] want to see him in our midst this
[15:23] morning as you unveil your word as you
[15:25] speak to our hearts. Lord, you know our
[15:27] needs. We just yield ourselves to you
[15:29] and ask that you'll come and take
[15:30] complete control in the name of Jesus
[15:33] Christ.
[15:34] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[15:38] Brother Long, is brother Martin here?
[15:49] I had forgotten about brother Sagawa and
[15:51] also there's a new brother here. God
[15:53] bless you. Are you the brother to Paul?
[15:57] Oh no. Okay. I think it's a new face as
[15:59] well. All right. So, uh I think you can
[16:03] do that until brother Martin comes in.
[16:06] Now I want to speak on you can never be
[16:09] the same again. Tell your neighbor you
[16:12] can never be the same again.
[16:15] And I heard uh sister Martha uh I heard
[16:18] you in the testimony this morning. You
[16:21] you were giving a testimony about your
[16:23] daughter and how the Lord has been
[16:24] gracious and um you know to be able to
[16:26] receive the message player and
[16:28] appreciating the saints and then you
[16:30] said a statement said she can never be
[16:32] the same again.
[16:34] So I thought that that was a preamble of
[16:36] the sermon this morning. Amen. You can
[16:39] never be the same again. So God God
[16:41] already has confirmed that that's what
[16:42] we need to speak on. You know I was
[16:45] desiring and asking God what will I
[16:47] speak on this morning and I did not know
[16:49] what I will preach about and uh uh we
[16:52] had traveled and u but so the whole
[16:54] yesterday I was in the services there
[16:56] but I was not really there because in my
[16:58] mind I was traveling many kilometers to
[17:01] try and find out the mind of God for the
[17:02] service this morning. And so these words
[17:05] came to me in one of the services as one
[17:07] of the brothers ministered. that says
[17:08] you can never be the same again. It just
[17:10] came to me and stuck with me and then I
[17:12] went to studying and I believe that the
[17:14] Lord will speak to us this morning.
[17:16] Amen.
[17:16] Praise the name of the Lord.
[17:18] Now we will go and and read in shortly
[17:22] in Acts chapter 3 from verse one.
[17:26] Um but before we do that there is a
[17:28] quote that I want to read for you here.
[17:30] Brother Martin, I think um instead of
[17:33] the brother interpreting from the other
[17:35] side, his voice is gone. just come here
[17:36] and help from here so that uh we can all
[17:40] be in the same in the same accord. So
[17:43] I'm taking brother Martin awares but I
[17:45] trust that the holy spirit will will use
[17:47] him. Can you all pray for him?
[17:51] Amen. So I'll wait for you brother
[17:53] Martin.
[18:06] In the message Jesus Christ is the same
[18:08] yesterday, today and forever.
[18:19] Our prophet says something here very
[18:21] substantial which I want to start with.
[18:26] We find the apostle Peter had had not
[18:29] enough education to sign his own name.
[18:36] Jesus gave him the keys to the kingdom.
[18:41] And he says Peter and John passing
[18:43] through the gate called beautiful.
[18:48] They perceived that they were ignorant
[18:50] and unlanded people.
[18:56] The people knew that Peter and John were
[18:58] not land.
[19:01] They were ignorant men, ignorant people,
[19:06] but they took heed to them
[19:09] knowing they had been with Jesus.
[19:14] And he says, "Now, of course, I want to
[19:16] ask you, how did they know that these
[19:18] men were had been with Jesus?"
[19:24] How did they know? It was out of the
[19:27] works that they were work out of the
[19:29] their actions.
[19:32] It was out of their life.
[19:35] You know that you know they were able
[19:37] like you Mr. Sega were people you know
[19:40] the people that knew you one year ago.
[19:41] They will begin to look at you
[19:48] gradually. They will begin to see a
[19:50] change
[19:52] and then they will know surely something
[19:54] has happened in your life.
[19:58] There is a brother in the meetings in
[19:59] Mitana yesterday that gave a wonderful
[20:01] testimony of Jesus
[20:05] and it was quite touching to me
[20:09] and how you know they were into all
[20:11] sorts of things in the world.
[20:16] how he said that how they were going to
[20:19] the ball games with his friends.
[20:25] But you see when he received the word
[20:29] and he received the Holy Spirit in his
[20:31] soul,
[20:33] it was the beginning of the end of that
[20:34] kind of lifesty.
[20:46] And so here they were able to see Peter
[20:49] and John and they were they had they had
[20:51] they were able to say that they had been
[20:54] with Jesus.
[20:59] And he says so that's the thing we look
[21:01] for today
[21:04] to be and to associate with Jesus.
[21:09] I don't know about you but that's my
[21:10] desire to associate with Jesus.
[21:14] And if you ever associate with him,
[21:16] [Applause]
[21:18] you will never be the same again.
[21:22] And by the way, the way that word that
[21:25] phrase is, the way it came to me,
[21:28] I'm not even saying that you will you
[21:30] will be the same or you might be the
[21:31] same. You might that you will be changed
[21:34] completely.
[21:40] Some, as we will see in the scriptures,
[21:42] were never changed completely.
[21:52] But you see, as long as they met Jesus,
[21:56] as long as you meet Jesus,
[21:59] you can never be the same again.
[22:04] Whether you want or you do not want,
[22:08] something just changes
[22:11] that sets you on a new cross in in your
[22:13] life.
[22:16] Let me say it changes everything
[22:20] and you can never be the same again.
[22:26] And I think I was I was listening to
[22:28] Billy Graham one time
[22:31] and and he was speaking to a million or
[22:33] millions of people
[22:36] and I think it was on that tape that I
[22:38] heard him say
[22:41] that for as long as you are hearing me
[22:43] today
[22:46] You can never be the same again.
[22:50] And the greatest he said the greatest
[22:52] mistake you have ever done
[22:56] is to come and listen to me speak
[23:01] and I believe not only Billy Graham
[23:05] every soul
[23:07] the greatest mistake they will ever do
[23:09] in life
[23:11] is to come and sit under the preaching
[23:13] of the word.
[23:16] Let me tell you, you can go under the uh
[23:18] the you know some inspirational speakers
[23:23] and maybe even maybe even forget what
[23:26] they ever said.
[23:29] You can go and sit under the teachers.
[23:33] Sometimes in school we have all gone
[23:34] through that system
[23:37] and you may forget what they have said.
[23:40] Do you remember what your P1 teacher
[23:42] taught you?
[23:44] Do you remember your sub the subjects
[23:46] you went through?
[23:49] When I begin talking about volcanist,
[23:51] some may not even know what
[23:55] some forgot
[23:57] about some subjects they started in
[23:59] school.
[24:01] But let me tell you, there is one
[24:04] encounter.
[24:06] There is one person that you will meet
[24:08] one time
[24:12] and you must change.
[24:16] You cannot remain the same
[24:19] and that is Jesus
[24:21] and Jesus on earth is represented by
[24:24] preachers.
[24:27] Whenever you sit like you are seated
[24:29] here this morning
[24:31] and we open the word and read the word
[24:33] and the word of God is preached.
[24:38] Let me tell you, you can never be the
[24:39] same again.
[24:41] Never. Tell your neighbor one more time,
[24:44] you can never be the same again.
[24:47] Come on, tell your neighbor that you can
[24:49] never.
[24:53] And he says that's the thing we are
[24:54] looking for today.
[24:57] is to be in association with Jesus.
[25:01] He says, "And if you ever associate with
[25:03] him,
[25:06] praise the name of the Lord."
[25:07] Amen.
[25:08] Brother Sham, if you can give me more
[25:09] sound here or more sound on the speaker,
[25:10] I don't know where, but I I need more
[25:12] more power, more sound. He says, "If you
[25:14] ever associate with him,
[25:18] you will never be the same again."
[25:21] That is true. You can never be the same
[25:25] person after once associated.
[25:31] Hallelujah.
[25:32] Amen.
[25:33] After once
[25:36] I'm afraid not twice,
[25:39] not three times. Brother Joseph he said
[25:42] once
[25:45] associating with Jesus
[25:48] let me tell you in life there are some
[25:52] associations that are very contagious
[25:55] [Applause]
[26:01] I I don't know I don't know throw the
[26:04] word there brother when you get it
[26:05] contagious I don't know how to say that
[26:07] in Luganda you know very contagious it
[26:11] kind of you know some people that you
[26:13] meet and you relate with
[26:16] and and somehow they just
[26:19] either waste your life.
[26:22] [Applause]
[26:24] Some of them either waste your life,
[26:27] others change your life for the better.
[26:31] Others confuse your life forever.
[26:34] You can meet a friend
[26:37] and a friend will introduce you to
[26:39] smoking for example
[26:42] and you never did know smoking
[26:46] you never did think about smoking
[26:48] but the moment you meet that friend one
[26:50] time
[26:53] and he talks to you about smoking
[26:56] from that moment
[26:58] he might mess up your life forever.
[27:02] That kind of friendship is a bit
[27:04] contagious.
[27:07] And I want to say this
[27:09] that our associations
[27:12] in this life are very important.
[27:18] Our associations in this life are very
[27:20] important.
[27:22] And here he says that when you that you
[27:25] can never be the same person
[27:29] after once associating with Jesus.
[27:34] Amen. The moment you associate with him,
[27:38] you can never be the same again.
[27:41] And Jesus today
[27:43] is here,
[27:45] but he's not here in a person,
[27:49] but he's here in the form of the word.
[27:53] and a man and a woman that receives the
[27:55] word
[27:57] receive the Holy Ghost.
[28:00] You have Jesus in you.
[28:03] Amen. Amen. And whenever you go and
[28:07] associate with people,
[28:09] they are not associating with you.
[28:12] They associating with him that you
[28:17] let me tell you, they can never be the
[28:19] same again.
[28:23] I was so inspired by this because I was
[28:25] even thinking about my own life.
[28:33] I'm going to give you several examples.
[28:35] I'm not planning to be lengthy this
[28:36] morning as usual.
[28:41] And and so I want us to look at Acts
[28:43] chapter 3 verse one.
[28:48] Just want to give you some little
[28:49] inspiration this morning that will
[28:50] encourage you to move on.
[28:56] Now Peter and John went up to together
[28:59] into the temple at the hour of prayer
[29:02] being the ninth hour. If you are reading
[29:04] the Luganda Bible, just follow me. The
[29:05] brother will not read just in the
[29:07] interest of saving on time.
[29:08] Amen. And a certain man lame from his
[29:11] mother's womb was carried whom they laid
[29:14] daily at the gate of the temple which is
[29:17] called beautiful to ask arms of them
[29:20] that entered into the temple
[29:24] who seeing Peter and John about to go
[29:27] into the temple asked an arms.
[29:30] And Peter fastening his eyes upon him
[29:33] with John said look on us. Follow me
[29:37] here now closely. Here are a people
[29:44] Peter and John
[29:47] walking
[29:50] by the gate called beautiful.
[29:55] Are you hearing me?
[30:04] This man had been there for years and
[30:06] years.
[30:09] This
[30:11] he has been in pain for many years.
[30:16] He had spent all his life.
[30:20] He was there confused.
[30:23] He knew nothing to do.
[30:27] And what he could already was to bake.
[30:30] because he was a lame man, he could not
[30:33] walk. And this man because of his
[30:35] situation,
[30:37] he thought he will never come out of it.
[30:44] I don't know if that lame man is here
[30:45] this morning.
[30:48] Sometimes we are in situations
[30:52] that have carried over been carried over
[30:55] and over and over.
[31:00] that have been from generation to
[31:02] generation
[31:05] and you've been the same.
[31:08] And you know when you look at your
[31:11] father,
[31:13] they were the same as you are.
[31:16] and you look at your grandfather
[31:19] the same as you are
[31:22] until you feel that this condition will
[31:24] never leave you.
[31:29] And quite frankly, I believe that some
[31:31] of us
[31:34] live below our pre our godly privileges,
[31:38] [Applause]
[31:39] our God-given promises. We live below
[31:42] them
[31:44] because
[31:46] We always look at our situation.
[31:51] We look at life
[31:53] according to the dictates of our
[31:56] situation.
[32:00] For example, right now if I asked giving
[32:03] an example,
[32:05] how many here
[32:07] have a dream of buying a private jet?
[32:14] No, not because I said it.
[32:17] Not not because I said it. Did you have
[32:20] it before? Be be honest.
[32:24] Okay, how many here have a dream of
[32:26] buying a private jet?
[32:30] Okay, we have only one person.
[32:33] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. May
[32:35] God grant it to you, my brother.
[32:37] But listen,
[32:40] I was just giving an example.
[32:43] I don't know his associations
[32:47] but you will find
[32:50] people who you've been raised in a a
[32:53] community
[32:58] and in that community.
[33:01] The richest
[33:04] is the one that had
[33:11] you are supposed to interpret is the one
[33:14] with
[33:16] you know
[33:18] the one with with a with a iron sheet
[33:21] you know rooftop or roofed building.
[33:24] Amen.
[33:24] And that is the richest in your
[33:26] community.
[33:30] I don't know if some of you have come
[33:31] out of that kind of communities.
[33:36] I have to type this physically so that
[33:37] we can be able to understand.
[33:41] And so
[33:43] your dream
[33:46] becomes
[33:48] to have a house of iron sheets.
[33:54] And everyone in that village
[33:57] will have that dream
[34:00] because they living according to the
[34:02] people they emulate.
[34:08] That's what everybody does actually.
[34:12] We live according to the people we
[34:13] emulate.
[34:15] [Applause]
[34:31] Amen.
[34:32] Oh, I want to be like that person.
[34:35] That's why when you go on on on social
[34:38] media,
[34:41] listen to me this morning. Or if you go
[34:44] on YouTube, on Twitter, on Facebook and
[34:48] all these social medias,
[34:51] the people that you are following,
[34:54] the things that you are feeding on,
[34:57] the things that you are watching,
[34:59] if you are watching Rihanna
[35:02] and she's the Beyonce
[35:05] and you always feed on that stuff,
[35:09] trust me, my sister, my brother,
[35:13] Your life will begin to be fashioned
[35:16] after her.
[35:20] Because she will be your example and
[35:22] your greatest inspiration.
[35:27] The things we watch or the things we
[35:29] read is what inspires us.
[35:35] We cannot live above them.
[35:39] You will think you you can but you
[35:40] cannot.
[35:43] You can only live according to your
[35:45] inspirations.
[35:46] [Applause]
[35:48] But I want to tell you something this
[35:50] morning
[35:52] that when Jesus came on earth,
[35:56] he came to change everything.
[36:00] He came to change our mindset.
[36:03] He came to change our dreams.
[36:06] He came to change the status quo
[36:08] everything
[36:12] you know he found a poor man
[36:15] and he told him you don't need to be
[36:16] poor anymore
[36:19] the system had told him you can be poor
[36:21] the system had told him you are poor the
[36:23] system had put him in that place
[36:28] but when Jesus came
[36:31] he came to tell him listen I come to
[36:34] take you out of this place
[36:37] to another place.
[36:39] Amen. Amen. Regardless of what anybody
[36:42] saw.
[36:45] And that's why Jesus was a different
[36:47] preacher.
[36:50] Jesus was not preaching according to
[36:53] other people's inspiration.
[36:58] His life was different
[37:01] because he was a trend setter.
[37:05] Hallelujah. Amen. He came to change the
[37:08] whole thing.
[37:10] Let me tell you, there are some people
[37:13] who cannot live out of the box.
[37:18] You know, you were raised in that box,
[37:20] you think according to what everybody
[37:22] does,
[37:23] I've heard many times even in this
[37:25] fellowship.
[37:27] Some people saying we can do it like
[37:29] this because even the other church did
[37:30] like this.
[37:40] Have you had such comments?
[37:42] Let let us do this because even so and
[37:45] so even
[37:47] but who is the other one? I don't don't
[37:50] have to live in their box.
[37:53] Hallelujah. Amen. God can completely do
[37:57] something new.
[38:01] We have to open our minds
[38:04] to the realities of the word of God.
[38:09] Praise the name of the Lord.
[38:10] Amen. And so,
[38:13] so here we notice
[38:16] that here was a man
[38:18] for very many years.
[38:21] He had been sitting at that gate called
[38:23] beautiful
[38:27] and he was there.
[38:30] lame. He couldn't walk
[38:33] and as a result he became a beggar
[38:41] and one time
[38:43] some men who had Jesus Christ in them
[38:47] Peter and John
[38:50] they came his way
[38:53] and they were walking.
[38:56] Hallelujah.
[38:57] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[39:00] They were walking by
[39:02] and they were going by their own
[39:04] business.
[39:07] Let me tell you as a believer if Jesus
[39:10] Christ is in you,
[39:13] you must be a trend setter also.
[39:18] You don't follow other trends
[39:22] because everybody is dressing.
[39:24] [Applause]
[39:28] You also begin to dress m
[39:33] but I'm saying you don't know.
[39:37] Oh my god.
[39:41] How many know here?
[39:44] How many don't?
[39:46] Oh,
[39:50] because everybody is is is is you know
[39:53] putting their trouser up
[39:56] like
[39:59] you also follow that
[40:04] because everybody's wearing mini skirts.
[40:09] You are also following that.
[40:13] You understand what I'm saying? It is a
[40:16] trend.
[40:21] Yes, I think that's a a better word.
[40:23] Maybe it's a trend that somebody else
[40:26] set
[40:28] and then somebody else set it
[40:31] and everybody follows.
[40:33] And do you know where those trends come
[40:35] from?
[40:37] Say they come from Hollywood
[40:41] and and that comes from hell.
[40:46] And then it goes all over the world
[40:48] and sweeps across the nations and the
[40:51] world and everybody follows that.
[40:54] But let me tell you, when Jesus comes in
[40:58] your life,
[41:00] when you meet him one time,
[41:02] hallelujah. Amen. You begin to live like
[41:06] a rebel.
[41:09] Amen. you not live according to the
[41:11] trends of
[41:13] you will do the opposite of what others
[41:16] are doing
[41:17] and they will ask you what is wrong with
[41:19] you
[41:21] and you will say I don't know I am no
[41:24] longer the same I met somebody who
[41:28] changed my life forever
[41:32] hallelujah amen let me tell you here
[41:36] these men were this man was There
[41:40] the priest had seen him
[41:42] and understood he was lame
[41:45] and understood he was a beggar.
[41:48] He had given him something.
[41:51] The rich man saw him. He understood he's
[41:54] like
[41:56] he gave him something. The poor man saw
[41:59] him. The little girl saw him. The little
[42:02] boy saw him. Everybody saw him. And they
[42:06] had pity for him.
[42:08] and they gave him some out.
[42:10] But one time he met some men
[42:15] that had met Jesus.
[42:18] These ones were not train followers.
[42:21] Hallelujah.
[42:23] They were trainers.
[42:27] When they met him,
[42:30] they told him, "How about if we change
[42:32] the style?
[42:37] Hallelujah.
[42:38] Amen.
[42:39] He said, "Give me something. Give me
[42:41] something."
[42:42] They told him, "Look, we don't have
[42:45] anything to give
[42:48] according to the old style.
[42:53] We have nothing to give. But here is
[42:56] something we have.
[42:58] We have a new trend.
[43:01] We have a new thing.
[43:04] We have Jesus.
[43:06] We have Jesus.
[43:08] When you meet with Jesus, you can never
[43:11] be the same again.
[43:14] And at that moment, Hallelujah. At that
[43:17] moment, when they looked at him,
[43:22] the Bible said he looked at them
[43:26] and they said, "In the name of Jesus,
[43:31] rise up and walk.
[43:36] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God.
[43:41] Amen.
[43:50] And he took him by the right hand,
[43:54] lifted him up, and immediately his feet
[43:57] and ankle bones received strength.
[44:07] I believe I'm like Peter and John.
[44:10] Hallelujah. Amen.

[45:07] They told this man in the name of Jesus
[45:11] Christ
[45:12] of Nazareth,
[45:14] rise up and walk.
[45:17] [Music]
[45:19] And he leaping up stood up
[45:26] and walked
[45:28] and entered with them into the temple,
[45:32] walking and leaping,
[45:35] praising God.
[45:38] When you meet Jesus,
[45:40] you begin to praise God.
[45:43] Hallelujah. You will begin to be happy
[45:48] because something has happened my
[45:50] brother.

[46:07] sat for arms

[46:49] they will see us in wonder
[46:53] and amazement.
[46:57] Wait a moment. Isn't he the one who used
[47:00] to sit down there?
[47:05] What happened to him? He was lame.
[47:10] How come?
[47:13] Wow.
[47:15] Two things. Wonder and amazement.
[47:21] People will feel the same.
[47:23] Isn't he the one
[47:26] that was a a very good fornicator?
[47:35] Every girl was his girlfriend.
[47:39] Isn't he the one?
[47:45] What a moment. Isn't he the one?
[47:49] Oh my goodness. Oh,
[47:52] this is what I want them to think about
[47:53] me.
[47:55] I am not afraid
[47:58] of the world to see me different.
[48:02] Isn't she the one
[48:05] that was using makeup?
[48:11] How come she's
[48:15] And then what's the next thing?
[48:17] Wow.
[48:20] Wow,
[48:22] what a wonderful thing.
[48:25] Wonder
[48:28] amazement.
[48:31] Wonder and amazement.
[48:35] Isn't he the one that used to go to
[48:38] witchcraft?
[48:43] Wow.
[48:46] Yes, Mother Ivan.
[48:47] Yeah, Brother Ivan. Let them see you in
[48:49] wonder and amazement.
[48:54] And then praise the name of the Lord.
[48:56] Amen.
[48:57] He says none of these things that you
[48:58] see none of these things that had been
[49:00] with Jesus,
[49:03] none of those rather none of those that
[49:05] had been with Jesus.
[49:10] None of those that had been with Jesus
[49:12] remained the same.
[49:14] It is impossible to be with Jesus and
[49:16] remain the same.
[49:18] Peter who was previously fearful is no
[49:20] longer the same.
[49:23] The only thing the devil can do is to
[49:25] try and hinder that encounter.
[49:33] Peter was originally fearful.
[49:37] Peter was originally a nervous man.
[49:41] A little girl came to him
[49:44] and said, "You have been with him.
[49:47] He said
[49:50] at one time
[49:52] Peter received the Holy Ghost.
[49:55] He had been with Jesus.
[49:57] And here is the same same man
[50:01] with boldness.
[50:03] Hallelujah. Amen. Meeting a man at the
[50:06] desk and told him in the name of Jesus,
[50:12] see the name of
[50:14] this is the same man.
[50:17] that a girl told him
[50:21] you have been with him
[50:24] Jesus. Yes. Who is he?
[50:31] I don't I don't
[50:36] Jesus I don't know him.
[50:40] The man was so fearful
[50:43] to be associated with Jesus.
[50:47] But one time when he received the Holy
[50:50] Ghost,
[50:52] one time he had been with Jesus
[50:56] from that day
[50:59] and became bold.
[51:02] I want to say
[51:04] he was never the same.
[51:07] You two can never be the same.
[51:10] Sister Sister Peace, Sister Peace,
[51:13] when you receive the Holy Ghost,
[51:16] You can never be the same again.
[51:19] Hallelujah.
[51:20] Amen.
[51:21] And that moment
[51:23] he was the one saying
[51:25] now
[51:26] silver and gold have I none
[51:30] but in the name of Jesus
[51:37] in the name of Jesus.
[51:46] Can anything good come from Nazareth?
[51:50] Nazareth was a very despised place by
[51:55] Peter here was not ashamed
[51:59] to associate himself
[52:02] in the name of Jesus
[52:04] of Nazareth.
[52:06] rise up and
[52:12] the only thing that the devil can do is
[52:13] to try and hinder this encounter,
[52:19] but he can't hinder it,
[52:21] he cannot hinder you from meeting with
[52:23] Jesus.
[52:25] Oh, hallelujah. Amen. He can only delay
[52:29] it.
[52:32] Every seed that was predestinated by God
[52:37] must come in contact with Jesus.
[52:41] Hallelujah.
[52:42] Amen.
[52:43] Every seed, tell your neighbor, every
[52:45] seed,
[52:47] every seed that was predestinated.
[52:52] Amen. We have to come in contact with
[52:54] Jesus.
[52:56] The devil cannot stop it.
[52:59] The devil cannot hinder it.
[53:01] The only thing he can isolate,
[53:05] but he can't stop it.
[53:08] He can't he can't hinder it.
[53:11] You must receive the Holy Ghost.
[53:14] You must receive the Holy Ghost.
[53:16] That does not mean that it is on your
[53:19] part to do.
[53:21] I'm telling you. You must receive the
[53:24] Holy Ghost
[53:26] because the devil cannot hinder him.
[53:30] The devil cannot stop it, sister.
[53:33] Amen.
[53:34] Amen.
[53:35] Praise the name of the Lord.
[53:37] There is a power of the word.
[53:41] Oh, hallelujah.
[53:43] Amen.
[53:43] Now, don't get tied down again by
[53:45] traditions. He says,
[53:50] "No, this is an instruction." Okay? Is
[53:53] from the church ages. He says, "Now,
[53:55] don't get tied down by traditions.
[54:00] and CRs
[54:02] and organizations.
[54:05] This end message
[54:08] has come to call us out of tradition.
[54:16] This message came to call us
[54:20] to come out of human creed
[54:23] out of dogmas
[54:26] to come out of men's organization.
[54:30] If it was a political move,
[54:33] we would be the independent.
[54:36] We are not
[54:38] we are not
[54:40] we are not. Hallelujah.
[54:42] Amen.
[54:44] Independent.
[54:46] Hallelujah.
[54:47] Amen.
[54:50] We are independent.
[54:55] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[54:57] Amen.
[54:59] Let the devil take that.
[55:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Independent.
[55:03] We are independent.
[55:06] We have our bishop. Hallelujah. Amen.
[55:09] We are independent.
[55:13] inependent.
[55:15] We are independent
[55:18] who is amen.
[55:21] We are not bound with
[55:25] the organization
[55:27] churchal church
[55:30] not bound by churches. We are released.
[55:34] We have the message
[55:40] from
[55:43] set us free.
[55:44] Hallelujah.
[55:45] Amen.
[55:46] When you meet him,
[55:48] you can never be the same again.
[55:52] Amen.
[55:53] He says, "Don't be led astray
[55:58] by listening
[56:02] to those
[56:04] that deny the power of the word.
[56:10] You know there are many people who say
[56:11] they believe in the word.
[56:14] As long as you believe the word, you are
[56:17] going to the rapture.
[56:20] No, that's a lie.
[56:24] The devil believes the word.
[56:28] Did you know? Did you know that number
[56:31] one believer is the devil?
[56:35] Did you know that he believed before you
[56:36] did?
[56:39] That's why he's a deceiver.
[56:42] Because he believes, but he's deceiving
[56:43] people not to believe.
[56:48] The devil's deceived the Catholic
[56:49] church.
[56:52] The Bible says, "You believe there is
[56:54] one God." Do you believe it?
[56:59] You believe there is one God
[57:02] here. what I'm saying.
[57:03] Okay.
[57:03] You believe there is one God.
[57:06] The devil believes that too
[57:09] and trembles.
[57:12] He believes it and tremble.
[57:19] He believes in one God. The devil is not
[57:21] a twin believer.
[57:26] He doesn't believe the trinity of God.
[57:32] He doesn't believe it. And yet he has
[57:34] deceived them to believe.
[57:38] The devil believes. It's not only
[57:41] believing.
[57:43] I'm telling you, it's not only
[57:45] believing.
[57:47] After believing,
[57:49] then you should not deny the power of
[57:52] the word.
[57:55] I wish I had a more voice to shout.
[58:00] You shouldn't believe in the power of
[58:02] the word. You should disbelieve in the
[58:04] power of the word.
[58:07] The word has power.
[58:10] And the name of Jesus has power
[58:13] to change a sinner to a sinner,
[58:16] to change a drunker to a sober man,
[58:21] to change a fornicator
[58:24] to a man that will live for the Lord.
[58:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[58:32] I said hallelujah. Amen.
[58:35] That means praise our God.
[58:40] This is our team.
[58:42] We don't have moneyu.
[58:44] There's been a lot of money going on in
[58:46] Manchester,
[58:48] Liverpool and Liverpool.
[58:49] I don't know which teams you people are
[58:50] supporting,
[58:53] but those ones are for the world.
[58:55] We have another team
[58:58] and this is our believer's team
[59:01] and we are here to support our team.
[59:04] Do I have supporters this morning?
[59:07] supporters of the team
[59:11] and the way we support our team.
[59:14] When a preacher says hallelujah,
[59:16] we shout back, "Amen."
[59:18] Amen.
[59:19] Hallelujah.
[59:20] Amen. You are even free to run around.
[59:23] You even free to clap your hands because
[59:26] this is our only thing.
[59:29] If the word
[59:32] does not have power
[59:34] to ignite your soul
[59:37] and make you feel like shouting,
[59:40] then to you it has no power.
[59:45] Yes, sir. Amen.
[59:47] Even to the person that is so silent and
[59:49] so quiet
[59:53] when they hear the word and have a seat
[59:56] of God in there. But my God, it makes
[59:59] them
[1:00:01] even old men.
[1:00:04] How many have seen old men jumping up
[1:00:07] and dancing under the power of the
[1:00:10] influence
[1:00:12] of the word
[1:00:14] on the day of Pentecost?
[1:00:16] They say these men are not drunk.
[1:00:20] The others say they drunk.
[1:00:23] But Peter said they are not drunk with
[1:00:26] wine.
[1:00:29] But the world saw them as drunkards.
[1:00:33] Brother, sister,
[1:00:34] brother, sister,
[1:00:35] until we behave like they did,
[1:00:40] we have not reached at Pentecost
[1:00:44] to the extent where the world
[1:00:47] questions,
[1:00:49] are they drunkards?
[1:00:51] Who are those people that meet in that
[1:00:53] room
[1:00:55] causing too much commotion? And
[1:00:58] are they okay? Are they nuts?
[1:01:03] Yes, they are drunkards.
[1:01:05] Drunkards of the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:09] I imagine Mary, the mother of Jesus.
[1:01:13] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:01:17] She was there in the upper room.
[1:01:25] But when Mary was there in the upper
[1:01:27] room,
[1:01:29] you know what she did? Paul The Bible
[1:01:32] says she was speaking in tongues,
[1:01:35] shouting and dancing.
[1:01:38] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:41] Hallelujah. So what is happening?
[1:01:44] What's going on? Are they crazy?
[1:01:49] No. They are speaking in tongues.
[1:01:53] They are dancing in the spirit because
[1:01:55] the power
[1:01:57] of the Holy Ghost has come in their
[1:02:00] soul.
[1:02:02] And when you meet Jesus,
[1:02:05] you can never be the same again.
[1:02:09] Amen.
[1:02:12] Don't be led astray by listening to
[1:02:14] those that deny the power of the word
[1:02:19] and deny that same Jesus
[1:02:22] and they deny and they say Jesus doesn't
[1:02:24] save
[1:02:26] that he doesn't heal. He doesn't fill
[1:02:29] with the Holy Ghost and power but we
[1:02:31] believe
[1:02:33] Jesus saves.
[1:02:35] There is power in the word.
[1:02:37] Come on help me to preach this today.
[1:02:40] There is power in the word. We believe
[1:02:44] Jesus saves.
[1:02:46] Jesus heals.
[1:02:48] Jesus fills with the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:51] Jesus filled with power.
[1:02:54] And he says you are God's free men.
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:03] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:05] I am not bound.
[1:03:08] I am not bound by religion. I am not
[1:03:11] bound by culture. I am not bound by all
[1:03:14] these associations of the world.
[1:03:18] I am not bound by politics.
[1:03:21] I am not bound
[1:03:23] by the lusts of the things of the world.
[1:03:26] I am not bound.
[1:03:28] I am a free man.
[1:03:31] I am not even a mug.
[1:03:34] I am not a
[1:03:39] I am God is free man.
[1:03:44] Amen.
[1:03:45] I have been set free
[1:03:47] from the bondages of Egypt.
[1:03:52] Amen.
[1:03:55] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:03:56] Amen.
[1:03:57] The devil doesn't believe it.
[1:03:59] But I believe it.
[1:04:03] Hallelujah.
[1:04:04] Amen.
[1:04:05] And to prove that
[1:04:07] Wherever you go in the world,
[1:04:10] the believers
[1:04:12] behave the same way.
[1:04:16] So you see, it's not a cultural thing.
[1:04:22] Germans are very quiet people.
[1:04:26] But let them receive the Holy Ghost. Oh
[1:04:28] my God. They begin jumping jumping up,
[1:04:32] shouting and they believe in the power
[1:04:34] of God and healing and signs and
[1:04:36] wonders.
[1:04:39] You are God is free man.
[1:04:44] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:04:45] Amen.
[1:04:46] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:04:47] Amen.
[1:04:48] Come here little boy.
[1:04:57] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:04:59] Come here.
[1:05:03] Today we're going to preach.
[1:05:04] Here is what the devil has done.
[1:05:15] That's
[1:05:22] that's how the how the
[1:05:25] that's how the prisoners behave.
[1:05:28] You handcuff them, they are fighting,
[1:05:31] but I have nothing to die. I have to
[1:05:32] handcuff him.
[1:05:33] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:05:34] Amen.
[1:05:38] You will forgive me. You see,
[1:05:40] this is what the devil has done.
[1:05:44] This is what the devil has done.
[1:05:47] But here is what the message is saying.
[1:05:51] You are God is a free man.
[1:05:55] Loosed by his own blood.
[1:06:01] We are loosed.
[1:06:03] At first we've been bound like this.
[1:06:07] Hallelujah. Amen. We've been bound by
[1:06:10] tradition,
[1:06:13] by religion.
[1:06:17] You find somebody fighting for his
[1:06:19] Catholic religion,
[1:06:23] fighting for Anglican religion,
[1:06:26] fighting for his Adventism,
[1:06:28] fighting for his Islam,
[1:06:31] fighting for his.
[1:06:34] In this message,
[1:06:37] we have been set free from the bondage
[1:06:38] of religion.
[1:06:42] We are none of them.
[1:06:44] We have come out of religion.
[1:06:47] We have been lu.
[1:06:51] Amen. What is your religion? I am a
[1:06:54] Christian.
[1:06:56] If the devil doesn't like it,
[1:07:00] you can really go to hell. That is where
[1:07:03] it belongs.
[1:07:05] And here
[1:07:07] we are being bound by culture.
[1:07:13] You know where do you come from brother?
[1:07:16] I come from Torah.
[1:07:18] You are children of who?
[1:07:22] For us.
[1:07:24] I will find out.
[1:07:25] You will find out. Praise the name of
[1:07:27] the Lord.
[1:07:28] Amen.
[1:07:30] You know for us the children of Nambi
[1:07:33] the way we do our things
[1:07:38] brother for us we are children of Nambi
[1:07:40] we are bound. That's right.
[1:07:45] You are bound. Hallelujah.
[1:07:47] Amen.
[1:07:49] You are bound. Hallelujah.
[1:07:50] Amen.
[1:07:52] You are bound.
[1:07:57] You are bound. Christian,
[1:08:00] the message is telling us
[1:08:03] we were released
[1:08:06] of Jesus.
[1:08:09] You find them when they're going to
[1:08:11] bury.
[1:08:13] They they put some things in the make
[1:08:16] some you find
[1:08:19] where they're going to
[1:08:22] where they're going for
[1:08:24] all the things.
[1:08:27] These are the things I'm talking about.
[1:08:30] Those are the things of the people in
[1:08:31] the world. You find them.
[1:08:35] They going
[1:08:38] them.
[1:08:40] They do many rituals.
[1:08:42] Brothers and sisters,
[1:08:45] deliver
[1:08:50] all the things which had bound us.
[1:08:52] Hallelujah. Amen. You find them.
[1:08:57] When it says I belong to Democratic
[1:08:59] party,
[1:09:03] when you hear me mentioning I'm from DP,
[1:09:05] you better run.
[1:09:07] For me, I belong to NRM.
[1:09:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] Hallelujah.
[1:09:12] We had gone to somewhere
[1:09:15] and we were quite some respectable
[1:09:17] people there.
[1:09:19] I will not say some could be watching
[1:09:21] the service. I noticed that right there
[1:09:27] different political parties
[1:09:32] and some of them were believers.
[1:09:35] When this person came representing
[1:09:37] another party,
[1:09:40] he was almost slapped away.
[1:09:44] This is
[1:09:47] have no place here.
[1:09:50] And you find believers
[1:09:52] fasting and fighting all those against
[1:09:54] fasting and fighting because of all
[1:09:56] those things
[1:09:59] they are bound.
[1:10:01] Friends, when you receive the message,
[1:10:03] it has to set you free from the party.
[1:10:08] If you want to go and vote,
[1:10:11] it's your right as a citizen.
[1:10:13] Vote whoever you want.
[1:10:17] Don't let politics enter your head.
[1:10:22] whereby it now makes you you use it as a
[1:10:25] filter.
[1:10:28] You see who is intelligent and who is
[1:10:30] dumb, who stupid,
[1:10:33] who is good or who is bad.
[1:10:37] That's a filter of politics.
[1:10:41] But God has given us another filter.
[1:10:46] The blood of Jesus.
[1:10:49] Hallelujah.
[1:10:50] Amen.
[1:10:51] When you see people through that filter,
[1:10:55] you can even come to your brother.
[1:10:59] You voted who you voted. So what about
[1:11:03] you?
[1:11:08] You voted.
[1:11:10] Okay.
[1:11:12] But me,
[1:11:15] brother. Okay. God bless you.
[1:11:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:11:19] Amen. Amen.
[1:11:21] Where do you find that in the world?
[1:11:23] Are these people nuts? Are they crazy?
[1:11:27] Different political parties and they
[1:11:28] enjoying one another
[1:11:31] before we are anything. We are God is
[1:11:34] free man.
[1:11:38] Hallelujah. Amen. Everything we see it
[1:11:40] through that filter.
[1:11:45] Which church do you attend?
[1:11:47] May I go to victory center? Are those
[1:11:50] people of that sight?
[1:11:54] God has set us free.
[1:11:57] The bride goes where the word is.
[1:12:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Tell somebody you have
[1:12:05] been set free.
[1:12:08] God, if you have not been set free, God
[1:12:09] is setting you free. Now, as I said,
[1:12:14] God has set you free.
[1:12:17] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:22] How are you feeling when you don't you
[1:12:23] don't have to
[1:12:26] you feeling good since you are now?
[1:12:28] Hallelujah.
[1:12:29] Amen.
[1:12:31] God bless you little boy.
[1:12:33] Thank you for preaching with me today.
[1:12:36] Let me hope you will not hurt me. I tied
[1:12:38] him too long. Listen church. I use a
[1:12:42] little boy as an example.
[1:12:46] He's there helpless.
[1:12:48] I'm bigger than him. He's smaller than
[1:12:51] me. I'm wiser than him. And that's what
[1:12:55] the devil makes us feel.
[1:12:58] No, he's not wiser than us.
[1:13:01] He that was in Solomon is in us.
[1:13:05] We are wiser.
[1:13:07] He that was in Solomon
[1:13:09] is in us.
[1:13:11] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:13:12] His name is Jesus. Yes.
[1:13:16] When Jesus Christ is in you,
[1:13:19] who is he?
[1:13:20] He is the word of the hour.
[1:13:23] And when he's in you, he has set you
[1:13:25] free.
[1:13:27] Amen.
[1:13:29] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:13:31] Let us see two more examples and then
[1:13:32] I'll
[1:13:34] go on on this, you know, long long. But
[1:13:36] let's let's go to John 5:1.
[1:13:47] John chapter one, chapter 5,
[1:13:50] five.
[1:14:07] After this there was a feast of the Jews
[1:14:09] and and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now
[1:14:12] there is at Jerusalem by the sheep
[1:14:15] market a pool which is called in the
[1:14:17] Hebrew tongue batha having five
[1:14:20] portions. In these lay a great multitude
[1:14:23] of important folk of blind halt withered
[1:14:26] waiting for the moving of the water. And
[1:14:29] the angel went down at a certain season
[1:14:31] into the pool and troubled the water.
[1:14:34] Whosoever then first after the troubling
[1:14:36] of the water, stepped in was made whole
[1:14:39] of whatsoever disease he had. And a
[1:14:41] certain man was there which had an
[1:14:44] infirmity 30 and 8 years. Now when Jesus
[1:14:47] saw him lie and knew that he had been
[1:14:51] now a long time in that case
[1:14:58] he said unto him wilt thou be made whole
[1:15:01] I don't know how many here I've been in
[1:15:03] a very long time in a certain situation
[1:15:09] you've been sick for so long
[1:15:14] the question Jesus is asking you a
[1:15:18] Maybe a spiritual sickness maybe
[1:15:21] will thou be made whole.
[1:15:25] The impotent man answered him, "Sir, I
[1:15:27] have no man. When the water is troubled
[1:15:30] to put me into the pool, and while I am
[1:15:33] coming, another stepeth down before me."
[1:15:36] Jesus said unto him, "Rise, take up thy
[1:15:38] bed and walk. Brother, read for me from
[1:15:40] verse 6 to verse 8.
[1:16:09] Wednesday.
[1:16:22] Oh my goodness. When I read this, I I
[1:16:25] was just really so touched last night.
[1:16:27] Now listen,
[1:16:30] here is a man
[1:16:32] who has been situation
[1:16:36] for longer time than you people have
[1:16:38] lived on earth 38 years.
[1:16:43] 38 years.
[1:16:45] 38 years.
[1:16:47] The man was on lying on a pallet.
[1:16:55] See, when you meet Jesus, you can never
[1:16:56] be the same again.
[1:16:59] And when Jesus Christ came,
[1:17:02] he came straight to this man
[1:17:07] for 38 years.
[1:17:10] The devil could still not stop Jesus to
[1:17:11] come.
[1:17:15] The devil cannot stop Jesus
[1:17:18] from finding his last seat
[1:17:22] wherever they are. They might even be in
[1:17:25] a bus somewhere.
[1:17:28] They might be lying in a palace
[1:17:29] somewhere
[1:17:31] spiritually or physically in a situation
[1:17:35] been going all over them.
[1:17:39] Jesus come.
[1:17:40] He comes straight at them.
[1:17:44] Hallelujah.
[1:17:45] Amen.
[1:17:46] Oh, glory to God. Jesus came to them
[1:17:51] and he asked him,
[1:17:53] prayed to him. I want you to think about
[1:17:56] it for a moment. There were many others
[1:17:59] in that place.
[1:18:01] For many years,
[1:18:04] Jesus did not go to them.
[1:18:07] Jesus went to him.
[1:18:10] There is a reason.
[1:18:12] Jesus came to you.
[1:18:16] There is a reason Jesus came to me and
[1:18:20] the reason is not a secret.
[1:18:24] I know he came to me because I was in
[1:18:28] his mind
[1:18:30] before the foundation of the world and I
[1:18:33] am here to fulfill
[1:18:36] the purpose God has purposed for me.
[1:18:41] And because he came to me,
[1:18:44] hallelujah. Amen.
[1:18:46] I can never be the same again.
[1:18:49] You can never be the same again
[1:18:52] because he has come to you
[1:18:54] and he came to this man and asked him
[1:18:58] said, "Will that be made whole?"
[1:19:03] But the mind of the man
[1:19:05] was too long on his problem
[1:19:10] that he did not see him
[1:19:13] who was talking to him.
[1:19:18] I hope your situation is not too bad and
[1:19:20] not with you too long.
[1:19:24] Sometimes when Jesus speaks to you by
[1:19:25] the word,
[1:19:27] you can see who is speaking to you.
[1:19:31] like ah that is we know him. He's our
[1:19:33] pastor. He lives there.
[1:19:35] He does this on Monday. He does this on
[1:19:36] Jesus.
[1:19:40] This man was looking at this man
[1:19:42] speaking to him.
[1:19:45] And he thought
[1:19:47] he's just a man after all.
[1:19:50] He has two feet like I do.
[1:19:53] He has two eyes like I do, hair like I
[1:19:56] do. What is so special about him?
[1:19:59] He's a man after all.
[1:20:02] He's asking me, "Can I be made whole?"
[1:20:05] And and Jesus answered, the man answered
[1:20:07] and said,
[1:20:10] "What are you talking about? I've been
[1:20:12] here for 38 years
[1:20:15] and whenever the water is troubled,
[1:20:18] you know, I have nobody to carry me and
[1:20:20] throw me in there."
[1:20:23] And so I I I'm always here. I've been
[1:20:25] here.
[1:20:29] There's nothing I can do about it.
[1:20:32] There's nothing I can do about it.
[1:20:36] Don't listen to that voice of the devil
[1:20:40] that tells you there is nothing you can
[1:20:41] do about your situation.
[1:20:46] There is nothing you can do about it
[1:20:48] without Jesus.
[1:20:51] But when Jesus shows up,
[1:20:57] when Jesus comes,
[1:21:00] you can never be the same again.
[1:21:04] Hey, I wish there would have been
[1:21:06] somebody
[1:21:09] ran to this man
[1:21:12] told him, "Sir, it is Jesus speaking to
[1:21:16] you,
[1:21:19] but this man was lying on a pilot
[1:21:24] and he did not understand
[1:21:27] that this one that is speaking to you,
[1:21:30] he's the author of life."
[1:21:34] He can change the unchanged things.
[1:21:37] He can rewrite his life.
[1:21:40] He can remove some things and he can put
[1:21:43] some things.
[1:21:45] He doesn't even need a troubled water
[1:21:49] because he is the one that was troubling
[1:21:52] the water.
[1:21:54] Somebody ought to have told this man,
[1:21:58] you don't need a troubled water
[1:22:01] because the one that troubles the water
[1:22:04] is right before you.
[1:22:06] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:08] He is here to come and trouble the water
[1:22:11] for you.
[1:22:13] Somebody told that man,
[1:22:16] Hallelujah. Amen. He is standing right
[1:22:18] before you.
[1:22:23] When it comes to you, my brother,
[1:22:26] you can never be the same again.
[1:22:28] I don't care whether you're poor. I
[1:22:31] don't care whether you are sick. I don't
[1:22:33] care whether you're blind. I don't care
[1:22:35] whether you can't see or you can't talk,
[1:22:39] you can't hear, your situation is so
[1:22:42] bad.
[1:22:44] Your family and have no food
[1:22:48] in a bad situation.
[1:22:50] You have no tition fees.
[1:22:53] You have no husband.
[1:22:55] You know you are you you are suffering.
[1:22:57] All that is nothing
[1:23:00] to the one that troubles the water.
[1:23:04] He is the one that troubles the water.
[1:23:09] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:23:10] They did not need the man did not need
[1:23:15] that troubled water.
[1:23:17] He now needed
[1:23:19] the one that troubled the water.
[1:23:22] He had come.
[1:23:24] He had come to show him I am the one
[1:23:29] that was troubling the water. I am going
[1:23:32] to trouble the water for you.
[1:23:36] But before I do it, what do you think
[1:23:39] about it? What do you think about it?
[1:23:43] Why say do you believe you can be made
[1:23:45] whole?
[1:23:48] Oh my. If this man had revelation,
[1:23:51] he would have said trouble the water for
[1:23:54] me
[1:23:56] so that you can throw me inside.
[1:24:00] He can trouble the water for him
[1:24:03] and throw him inside.
[1:24:06] Amen. This man did not know that this
[1:24:10] was the water troubler.
[1:24:15] Amen. Woo!
[1:24:18] Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] Amen.
[1:24:21] Let us follow the story a little bit
[1:24:22] longer.
[1:24:25] Sir,
[1:24:27] I have no one to throw me inside.
[1:24:30] And immediately the man was made whole.
[1:24:34] When Jesus told him, Jesus told him,
[1:24:38] Jesus told him,
[1:24:41] go tell your neighbor, Jesus told him.
[1:24:46] Come on, you can preach with me for a
[1:24:47] few moments.
[1:24:49] Tell your neighbor Jesus told him.
[1:24:54] Well, I can't hear you preaching until I
[1:24:56] hear you preaching, then I'll continue.
[1:25:13] And Jesus told him,
[1:25:16] "Oh my God, I want to hear these words."
[1:25:19] Hallelujah.
[1:25:20] Amen.
[1:25:21] Hallelujah.
[1:25:22] Amen.
[1:25:23] And Jesus said unto him,
[1:25:25] "Oh my God."
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:32] Jesus said unto him,
[1:25:34] "Rise,
[1:25:41] brother, before the next step."
[1:25:44] Before the next step,
[1:25:47] you have to rise.
[1:25:51] Rise out of your doubts.
[1:25:54] Rise out of your disappointments.
[1:25:57] Rise out of your problems.
[1:26:00] Rise out of your trials.
[1:26:02] Rise out of your suffering.
[1:26:05] Rise out of your self-pity.
[1:26:09] Rise out of your failures.
[1:26:12] Come on, church. Rise.
[1:26:16] Jesus told the man, "Rise."
[1:26:19] The man would have said, "How can I rise
[1:26:23] for I am bound?
[1:26:26] I am bound
[1:26:28] for 38 years.
[1:26:30] Jesus doesn't care
[1:26:34] because he is the water troubler.
[1:26:38] When the water troubler tells you rise,
[1:26:42] don't tell him it is too hard.
[1:26:45] Don't tell him I cannot rise
[1:26:48] and you tell him how many years you've
[1:26:49] been like that.
[1:26:51] When he tells you rise,
[1:26:55] brother, sister, rise,
[1:26:56] brother, sister,
[1:26:58] don't put it through your head.
[1:27:01] Don't put it through your mind.
[1:27:03] You just put it in your heart.
[1:27:06] I believe it.
[1:27:08] You said he said it. I believe it. God
[1:27:12] settles it for me.
[1:27:16] And Jesus told a man,
[1:27:18] rise.
[1:27:20] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:21] Are you ready for the next stage?
[1:27:24] When you arise in faith
[1:27:27] when you arise in faith,
[1:27:31] then come the next stage.
[1:27:34] Rise,
[1:27:36] take up thy bed.
[1:27:40] Hallelujah.
[1:27:42] Hallelujah.
[1:27:44] Amen. He said, "Rise."
[1:27:46] God bless you. Rise.
[1:27:49] Take up thy bed.
[1:27:53] Take up thy bed.
[1:27:56] What is your bed?
[1:27:59] The one that you slept for 38 years.
[1:28:04] Your bed of impossibilities.
[1:28:09] You have been sleeping on it.
[1:28:14] Your bed of failure.
[1:28:18] You are bed of distress.
[1:28:21] Come on. I'm preaching to the believers
[1:28:22] now.
[1:28:24] You have been on that bed.
[1:28:27] You are bed of worry.
[1:28:30] A bed of depression.
[1:28:32] You are bed of questions.
[1:28:35] Your bed of fear.
[1:28:38] Your bed that you have been sleeping on.
[1:28:49] When you rise,
[1:28:51] Jesus told him, "Take up your bed.
[1:28:56] Take up your bed.
[1:28:58] Don't just touch your bed. Don't just
[1:29:01] touch it.
[1:29:03] Take it up.
[1:29:05] Take up your bed.
[1:29:08] Take up your bed." Can you imagine?
[1:29:12] Jesus is telling a man
[1:29:15] a man who was sick,
[1:29:17] sick with pulsy
[1:29:20] for 38 years.
[1:29:22] Come on, guys. Take up your pain.
[1:29:28] Take up your bed. How many here are
[1:29:31] going to take up their bed?
[1:29:34] Says, "My fear, I will never sleep on it
[1:29:37] again.
[1:29:39] I will never sleep on it again.
[1:29:41] I'm going to carry it.
[1:29:45] Listen, we're not just carrying it.
[1:29:48] You're not just carrying it. There is
[1:29:50] only another state.
[1:29:52] Hallelujah.
[1:29:53] Hallelujah.
[1:29:54] That's only another state.
[1:29:56] After you take your bed,
[1:29:59] he said, "Rise,
[1:30:01] take up your bed
[1:30:03] and walk."
[1:30:09] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:30:11] Where are you walking to?
[1:30:13] You are following Jesus.
[1:30:17] Where are you walking to? You are
[1:30:19] walking by faith.
[1:30:21] You are walking by faith.
[1:30:24] You may feel depressed.
[1:30:27] You may feel in sin,
[1:30:30] so deep in sin.
[1:30:33] But this morning,
[1:30:35] God who is rich in mercy,
[1:30:38] he has passed by your way.
[1:30:41] I is saying to you, rise,
[1:30:44] take up thy bed.
[1:30:47] And
[1:30:52] how many are walking here today? How
[1:30:54] many are walking out of their province?
[1:30:57] How many are walking out of their
[1:30:58] trials?
[1:31:01] Come on, walk.
[1:31:03] Don't stay in one's place.
[1:31:07] When Jericho was falling down, they
[1:31:10] walked. They walked around the walls of
[1:31:14] Jericho
[1:31:16] around the walls of Jericho.
[1:31:18] And they were shouting, the shout of the
[1:31:21] king, the shout of victory.
[1:31:25] I said, "Take up thy bed and walk.
[1:31:32] [Applause]
[1:31:36] Amen.
[1:31:39] And immediately
[1:31:41] the man
[1:31:46] immediately
[1:31:48] somebody right now
[1:31:51] is going to be set free from sin.
[1:31:55] Amen.
[1:31:55] It could be me. It could be you. It
[1:31:59] could be any believer
[1:32:02] says immediately.
[1:32:06] Immediately.
[1:32:08] Tell somebody immediately.
[1:32:12] Not tomorrow.
[1:32:14] Not after the service.
[1:32:16] Not when they singing the last song.
[1:32:19] Immediately.
[1:32:23] Immediately.
[1:32:24] The man was made whole.
[1:32:29] Hallelujah.
[1:32:31] And he took up his bed
[1:32:36] and walked.
[1:32:40] Amen.
[1:32:40] And walked.
[1:32:42] And walked.
[1:32:44] What is your bed today?
[1:32:47] When Jesus comes your way, you can never
[1:32:50] be the same again.
[1:32:54] If you believe it, shout amen.
[1:32:59] If your amen doesn't scare the devil,
[1:33:01] then I don't think it is an amen.
[1:33:06] Brother Joseph, your amen must scare the
[1:33:08] devil in hell.
[1:33:13] So what happened?
[1:33:15] Did I just say amen to the world? Yes.
[1:33:18] Amen.
[1:33:19] Hallelujah.
[1:33:20] Amen.
[1:33:22] And that day was Sabbath.
[1:33:26] The Jews therefore said unto him,
[1:33:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:30] For just one moment, you can be seated.
[1:33:32] The Jews therefore said unto him
[1:33:35] that was cured,
[1:33:38] they said to him that was cured.
[1:33:42] It is the Sabbath day.
[1:33:47] Brother, you are breaking church order.
[1:33:50] Church order. What is all these things
[1:33:53] now?
[1:33:55] It is a church service.
[1:33:57] You are carrying chairs. People are
[1:33:58] running around.
[1:34:02] Oh my
[1:34:04] spirit.
[1:34:07] I hope there is no
[1:34:10] we are all believers. Are we not?
[1:34:14] The Jews say therefore the Jews said
[1:34:15] unto him that was cured.
[1:34:18] It is Sabbath day.
[1:34:21] It is not lawful.
[1:34:24] for thee to carry thy bed.
[1:34:32] Hallelujah.
[1:34:33] Amen.
[1:34:34] It is not lawful for you to carry your
[1:34:35] bed.
[1:34:39] They couldn't understand with what
[1:34:41] knowledge he was doing what he was
[1:34:42] doing.
[1:34:47] They were Pharisees.
[1:34:50] A Pharisee can only think like a
[1:34:51] Pharisee.
[1:34:54] But I believe is free and open-minded.
[1:35:00] God can do anything.
[1:35:03] Anything anywhere.
[1:35:13] He makes the lame to walk again,
[1:35:17] the blind to see
[1:35:22] to hear.
[1:35:24] Oh God,
[1:35:26] he can do.
[1:35:31] How many believe that?
[1:35:34] So he that was cured,
[1:35:37] they told him, "It is not lawful for you
[1:35:38] to carry your."
[1:35:41] He answered them and said,
[1:35:44] "I love this answer."
[1:35:48] When I was studying, it made me crazy.
[1:35:56] They he answered them and said,
[1:35:59] "He that made me whole, oh you,
[1:36:05] the same said to me,
[1:36:09] take up thy bed and walk.
[1:36:14] Why are you behaving like you doing?
[1:36:18] He told me
[1:36:22] that made me whole.
[1:36:25] The same spoke to me and said,
[1:36:28] "Take up your bed and walk.
[1:36:31] Why are you no longer wearing many
[1:36:33] skirts?"
[1:36:35] He that made me
[1:36:38] the said to me,
[1:36:40] take up your bed and walk.
[1:36:44] So where are your minis?
[1:36:46] I am carrying them
[1:36:49] to throw them to Jesus
[1:36:52] in turn
[1:36:54] is restoring my feet.
[1:36:59] Why are you no longer fornicating with
[1:37:00] girls but with?
[1:37:04] He that made me whole.
[1:37:07] The same said to me,
[1:37:10] take up your bed
[1:37:13] and walk.
[1:37:16] Why are you doing this, brother?
[1:37:19] He that made me whole.
[1:37:23] Have you ever seen a terrorist?
[1:37:27] A terrorist. They will ask him a
[1:37:29] question.
[1:37:32] Which is your next target?
[1:37:37] And his answer will be
[1:37:41] death to this nation.
[1:37:47] Glory to my country.
[1:37:51] Where is your next target?
[1:37:56] Speak death to this nation.
[1:38:01] Glory to my country.
[1:38:05] They bring something.
[1:38:09] What is your next target?
[1:38:12] Death to this nation.
[1:38:15] Glory to my God.
[1:38:18] Until the man is killed.
[1:38:22] But some of us,
[1:38:24] we don't want to behave
[1:38:27] like good Christian terrorist to the
[1:38:29] devil.
[1:38:35] A good Christian is a terrorist to the
[1:38:36] devil.
[1:38:41] Terrorist the kingdom of darkness. A
[1:38:43] terrorist to the kingdom of darkness.
[1:38:47] Do I have some terrorists here today?
[1:38:53] Why are you no longer behaving like
[1:38:55] this?
[1:38:58] He that made me whole.
[1:39:02] The same said unto me,
[1:39:05] take your bed and
[1:39:08] why are you doing this?
[1:39:11] Because the word said so.
[1:39:14] That's what the man was trying to say.
[1:39:18] Because Jesus said so.
[1:39:20] Because Jesus said so.
[1:39:22] You mean you are doing it because you
[1:39:24] were told to do so?
[1:39:26] Are you not crazy?
[1:39:28] No, I am doing it because I have an
[1:39:32] assurance
[1:39:34] that I am.
[1:39:37] I am no longer the same again.
[1:39:40] And therefore, I can do whatever this
[1:39:42] man tells me to do.
[1:39:47] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:39:49] Whatever the word says,
[1:39:54] you believe and do
[1:39:59] you believe and do
[1:40:04] not debating,
[1:40:07] no questioning,
[1:40:09] no doubting.
[1:40:11] Does the word say it?
[1:40:14] Oh, I believe it.
[1:40:18] That settles it for me.
[1:40:23] And finally,
[1:40:26] then asked they him,
[1:40:31] "What man is he
[1:40:35] that say to thee,
[1:40:38] take up thy bed and walk?
[1:40:43] What man is he?"
[1:40:46] The devil can't understand
[1:40:52] which God is he
[1:40:54] that makes you behave
[1:40:58] unreasonable
[1:41:01] unreasonable.
[1:41:05] Which God is he
[1:41:07] that is making you stop wearing
[1:41:09] trousers?
[1:41:12] You young lady,
[1:41:14] which God is he that makes you stop
[1:41:18] wearing your trousers.
[1:41:22] Sister peace, they will ask you, which
[1:41:25] God is he? Tell us,
[1:41:27] who is he? Tell me to stop wearing
[1:41:30] trouser. Who is he?
[1:41:33] The same that made me.
[1:41:37] Which God is he?
[1:41:41] Brother that makes you stop marrying
[1:41:43] more women.
[1:41:50] Which God?
[1:41:52] Which God is he? Brother Martin
[1:41:56] makes you love your wife so much,
[1:42:00] brother Seagawa. Brother,
[1:42:02] which God is he? Tell us. They ask the
[1:42:05] man
[1:42:07] that makes you stop going around.
[1:42:10] Which God?
[1:42:13] [Music]
[1:42:15] Which God is he?
[1:42:18] We don't understand. We also have a God.
[1:42:22] We also believe. We are also Bible
[1:42:24] followers. So who is your God?
[1:42:29] And we conclude with this man's answer.
[1:42:33] And he that was healed
[1:42:39] did not know who it was.
[1:42:50] So you mean to tell me
[1:42:54] you are doing things
[1:42:57] and believing things
[1:43:01] that were told to you by a god you have
[1:43:03] never seen.
[1:43:06] You people are nuts.
[1:43:10] What's wrong with you?
[1:43:12] What? What? What? What kind of clothes
[1:43:14] does he wear?
[1:43:18] The man did not know who it was.
[1:43:21] He had never met him.
[1:43:28] For Jesus
[1:43:30] had conveyed himself away.
[1:43:37] A multitude being in that place. Sorry.
[1:43:40] A multitude were in the place.
[1:43:43] There were many people in the place.
[1:43:46] And I tell you what, friends, as I as I
[1:43:48] finish, I've not finished my sermon, but
