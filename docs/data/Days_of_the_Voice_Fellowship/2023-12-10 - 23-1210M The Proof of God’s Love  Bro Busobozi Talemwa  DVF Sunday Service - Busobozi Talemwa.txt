bless you amen do you want to greet us yeah can you please give him my microphone just your names and where you're coming from from from K God bless you amen God bless you so much so I greet all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and told sister a you traveling she just she's traveling I think for Christmas period uh she'll be traveling uh Saturday next week or this week this is one of the sisters here that doesn't miss service so we remember to pray with her and I also see H you are going to forgive me I forgot your name again remind me from God bless you so much happy to be with you today and you join me to welcome her amen so before we go to the word this morning oh I'm told there more visitors I didn't see their hands oh these are my children come all of you come up here oh Ezra praise come up here come up amen I'm told this one is a preacher God bless you God bless you Ezra greet us everybody else good morning church praise God I thank God for bringing all of you here my name ised thank you bless asked him whe preachers he said yes so there are there are Sons to my uh to my bigger brother in the I'm happy that you are here today so uh before we go to the word I wanted to let you know just give a few announcements first of all Brothers brother Marvin are you you ready can you please put that on the screen quickly we have initially we started H we we informed everybody that we are registering for the Youth meetings by making a payment and so um several people have already done the payment and when you made your payment we registered you automatically because then you can be able to capture your details from the payment you have made but I noticed that there are many many who were not able to make a payment up front and yet they would like to come to the meetings making the the payment fast was being a stumbling block for them and yet it is very important for us to know who is going to attend uh the the youth meetings before the debts the main reason is uh yeah you just keep that until I'm ready so the main reason is uh we are pending to each person that will come at the camp ground we are spending a minimum of [Music] 120,000 that includes food it includes accommodation for three nights it includes you know payment of other things the H and other things and so when you add it all up a total sum depending on the amount of people that will come we are estimating a minimum of 20,000 and for accommodation alone anyone if you are planning to to sleep over at the meetings each night they will give you that mattress and the place to to [Music] sleep they will charge you 17,000 ugand so those ones who know how to do math how much is that for three nights 51,000 so that's only for accommodation it's not paid to the church it's paid to the people that are going to give us the venue and so that's why we requested the members of the church each person to at least contribute 100,000 that means automatically you are going to spend the time the the night there and also you are going to uh contribute on the food and other things as well as even if you are not going to sleep over there that contribution will help I need to explain this properly because after the service I know brother Isaac will cut this and put it also on the group for the others to understand so H because of this amount that each person we are going to spend on them it means if the each person we have asked publicly for each person coming to the meetings to contribute 50,000 that means they are contributing a little bit on the meting we would want to know that they are coming so we can be able to estimate how much we we are looking for we are going to prepare so because of that we decided to put up an online form where anyone can register and it does not need you to make a payment for that very form and the form looks like this but this is a bit blurry can you make it more clear think online brother Isaac you can put it up for people to see um it looks can you go up does this have life brother Marvin is that a picture or it's a a a screen so can you go up on the top of the of of where this is beginning at yeah all right that that's enough so no so it begins like that it will give you the details of the meetings and and the first question will be your full name so you put your full name down they ask for your email go you don't need to fill all the details because of time just go to the next uh then you put your email then you go and put your phone number just go down brother Marvin and then your church name uh now when it it comes to church name uh you just put the name of your church but down there then they will ask for your pastor now here you have to choose because I notice people we are writing things we were not even understanding so we put at least as much as many pastors names as we we could remember so just select select the pastors uh brother Marin are you together with me or doing something else select the pastors I think this is a video as much as you told me you were yeah right there so you can see them and then you just select one okay and then uh do you need accommodation yes or no you select that have you paid your camp fee yes or no you that and then do you need uh to uh what is that assistance that is for some people who can't even afford the 50,000 we want them we want to know how much they can afford do you need to sponsor more young people if you want to sponsor somebody or if you want to pay the 50,000 now for the members of The church here if you want to pay 100,000 plus more for somebody else [Music] and then uh what is the next question down there brother Isaac yeah then you have to select that there's a down there where you have to select and confirm that you agree that you will pay 50,000 you not already paid on arrival so that form is very easy you fill it in less than five minutes and then you submit it and then get all those details we have uh quite a few uh a few registrations I think I don't think they've gotten to 100 yet so that and many members of the church have not registered so that's why I thought I should let you know of that please get to make that registration if you don't have a smartphone someone with a smartphone can help you and they can you as an individual can register more than one people praise God also I wanted to let you know that uh yesterday the of November and uh we are used to paying six months or more uh but we have not yet received any rental contributions and so yesterday I made a payment of 1.6 million for two months up to end of Fe believing that you will contribute it and more for more months just I wanted to let that need to be known also how many felt that sound was a bit better today uh can can you give me a little more sound how many felt that music sound was a bit better today those ones who have musical ears I'm talking about those ones who have mus I'm talking have musal ears so um we we were advised by the musical team we had only one best speaker and it was dying slowly because there were supposed to be two so I took it up myself and ordered another best speaker and I paid an amount of 400,000 shs it has a balance on it of of 300,000 which I want to get today and pay after the service so right now you already know what you want to give towards that one person wants to give all the remainder then you will carry all the blessings for yourself but if you want to uh give something that will also be good that's what we do in this church we don't push and pull for money we let the needs to be known and we believe in giving we believe in God providing and uh we believe that when you give there is a blessing attached to that amen lastly we have our youth service after this service all the young people brother there was a brother was informing me that we need to uh we did not do it for the married couples but I think we will the young people will don't want you to go to go after the service we want you to stay I'm told they're arranging a bite and then uh afterwards we go to our service at 3 but I need you to uh write all your questions immediately after the service you give them to me and then I'll go through them and then be able to deal with them in the service so our camp speakers Our Youth Camp speakers on the meetings I've already paid their air tickets they have already uh got their visas brother brother Timothy from um USA Brother David mayor from Europe there's another brother coming from New Zealand and his wife and I think uh I was told that he has a cousin coming from South Africa well um so that brother will speak brother tazwell he speak in one of the services and also Pastor morgus confirmed from Ethiopia that is coming so if you are planning to miss you are missing at your own Peril but I'm telling you brother me and brother Andrew we are not planning to miss me and who sister f and sister eser we are not planning to miss pay your amount of money you're supposed to pay pray for the meetings that one is important pray for the meeting God will bless you and God will bless your prayers Ezra tell Mommy that you should also come amen praise God how many are ready for the word amen shall We Stand God gave me a little inspiration to speak Brother Martin went for the wedding of his sister God bless you to all those that supported him uh I'm told he will come back probably today or tomorrow so we are turning to the book of Ephesians i' have received a few calls of Brethren informing me or requesting me to make the youth meetings for 4 days because three days is too small I said I would very much want to do that if we had the resources we know that God will provide how many believe that with me we are reading Ephesians chapter 1 we are beginning from vers three shall we pray first our loveing Jesus we are now going to read a portion of your holy word I'm personally dependent only upon you I have no knowledge or wisdom of my own I don't even know how to speak Lord but I know that if you put your words on my mouth then I can speak your wisdom and knowledge to your people then you give meance and I'll be able to speak with authority because then it would not be me anymore it would be you Lord help me to take myself out of and also The Interpreter may we not just speak because we can speak but may it be because you are using us to speak and the people Lord I also pray for them whatever their need is May you enable them to hear what the spirit wants them I understand there are also others streaming this service and many others that will watch this service after Lord whoever will has been ordained to hear I pray it will impact their lives positively help them father in Jesus name amen amen uh blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his [Music] will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence verse having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in him himself amen which he has purposed in himself tell someone he purposed in himself amen you may be seated uh brother sham I'm not quite sure if this monitor is really working because because I'm using a lot of strength to speak that means there's a problem with the sound somehow amen I want to speak to you on a subject that I've called the proof of of God's [Music] love Do you believe that God loves you ask ask your neighbor can you prove it that's what I want us to to be able to do by the end of the service the proof of God is love the proof of God is love there's this verse here I will tell you when the sound is fine uh there's this verse here according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we would be holy and Without Blame before him in love that having predestinated us now before that let me read this verse again according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the [Music] world he did what he chose us where in him before when before the foundation of the world so God did not choose me when I believed he chose me from before the foundation of the world many Pentecostals pray pray like this oh God now that this person has believed remove his name from The Book of death and write it in the Book of Life don't ever pray such prayers don't even ever say Amen to such [Music] prayers I can see you are not understanding what I'm talking about God does not is not ring is not running to and fro that because people are getting saved God has a big pain and everybody that get saved an angel comes and announ so and so he okay give me the first of all a big duster big rubber he RS and then he goes with a big pen he writes it and then he says Ah even SC where is my he it where is my he that is a lie God is Not Like a Man we understand like men God is God and God knew the end from the very beginning God did not Choose You when you believed God chose you before you were born God chose you before you were in your mother's room what chose you before even the world was formed God God chose you before Genesis 1:1 where were you were in him when before the foundation of the world before even God became God you were before there was anything to worship you were in him so when did he choose you again now with that understanding let us read the scripture according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world that that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now when he shows you oh my this is going to excite some of you when God chose you he chose a blameless person he chose a holy person because in God there is no blame in God there is no sin so if I was in him he does not see a sinner he does not see a bad woman a bad man so he saw a perfect person he's coming to Rapture a perfect Church not the church that is here today but the church that he chose before the foundation of the world and now when you see the imperfections it only shows you a fact that Perfection must come praise God praise God let us also read Romans 8 these are very very interesting facts vers 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God you know here he says that that that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love this is a love story [Music] God chose you because he loved you and you need to understand love I talked about love here if you missed someone please go and listen to me two times I spoke on but here I'm speaking of agap love agap love is perfect love is not moved by actions or by feelings that kind of love is unconditional and that kind of love you do not do anything to attract it you are simply loved and then you are chosen are you following me now so now we know that all things work together for good to them that love God not them that love God with f but that love with if you love God no matter what happens no matter what goes around no matter what doesn't happen you are not moved because you know you sing that song I shall not moved I shall be like a tree planted By the Waters because Jesus is my savior I shall not be moved so now you are planted in Christ and you will say what can separate me from the love of God is it lack is it you know pestilence is it suffering is it death nothing shall separate me because you have the love that God has for you your love for God is Not conditional how many have prayed such prayers if you do this for me I swear I will love you forever then you don't truly love you your love is conditional but you're supposed to love God whether he commits you to death whether he commits you to life or to suffering or to good things or to Joy or to sadness your love should not be moved so he says all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose in Ephesians the verse n there are many many things I I really want you to get today so I want you to follow me closely he said having made known unto us the mystery of his will Accord to what to his good pleasure which he has already purposed in himself he has already purposed something in himself let me tell you if you talk to someone that claim to be your friend and they they tell you if you do this for me I will do this but in their hearts they have already purposed not to do what they saying nothing will move them because it is a purpose within them now God when he chose us he chose us according to the mystery of his will God has a will for you but that will always known it is mysterious it you have to seek after it you have to know it it has to be revealed to you but God before the foundation of the world according to his good pleasure he has already purpose in himself so God has already purposed what he's going to do with me it is not a new thing there is nothing I'm going to do nothing I will not do will change the purpose of God for [Music] me God has already purposed this and when God gives his word he gives it on the basis of his purpose so now here in Romans he continues on to say all things work together for good to them that love God to them who who are the called according to his purpose so that when God knew you God chose you God predestinated you I'm going to come to those things and God had a purpose when he when when he chose you he had a purpose for you and that purpose made him to call you I am the called according to his purpose I am here to accomplish a purpose he did not say according to the to all the cold to I don't know how to say he's not saying according to everyone but according to the I am the C brother tell someone I'm the I am the I am here to accomplish a purpose not demon no Spirit no power no Wicked forces of sat that purpose I am here to accomplish that purpose I am here to fulfill the desire of God I am here to live according to the pleasure of his own good will I am here because he loved me and because he loved me he chose me in him the foundation of the world God knew I would be here knew you would be here there is nothing happening by mistake he had it all in his mind knew it because he's God God doesn't plant things like man God does everything according to his purpose follow me closely here ver9 for whom he did for he also did predestinate to be confirmed to the image of his son if God chose you in him then he for knew you and if he for knew you what did he do he predestinated understand the word predestinate pre is before destinate is the destination now God knew the destination at the beginning so because he for knew you he predestinated you to be what to be conformed to the image of his son that means god already knew that you are going to be conformed to the image of Christ there is nothing can hinder you to come to that image there is no Devils there is not demon there is no an there is not Powers there is not kingdoms there is not man there is not system nothing a child of God to the image of Jesus Christ there is not Temptation there is not devils not even Temptation not even your flesh not even your doubts not even your mind that is too little compared to the purpose of God to them whom he for knew he also did predestinate Beed oh my good Lord amen God saw the end at the beginning if he knew you he saw you here and then he saw you there what we are struggling with is between this and that but God is saying don't want a daughter don't a son I've seen your hand I know how it will end it must end according to my purpose amen hallelujah hallelujah why that he might be the first born among manyen moreover whom he did predestinate them he Al called are you the called then you are predestinated and them that he called he also justifi oh hallelujah amen meaning in you we are going to be bed we were going to be Sinners we were going to be unworthy and so what did he do everyone he called he justified them he justified them brother I'm saying justification means that you did not sin in the first place when you say God I did this I did that he will say when did you do it don't remember when I was 15 years old he says I don't remember why because you are Justified that means your plate is clean clean how by his justification by his death on the cross and he say it is finished what do you think was finished the work of justif for every it was finished he said come unto me your sins may be r as but here is what I'm going to do wait who is he talking to he's talking to the C those ones who are called just come to me I will take your sins as I will make you white as snow what is that that is justification and whom he justified doesn't stop there them who he has Justified them he also glorify why do you think he's saying we are walking in Heavenly places we are not normal human being we are not normal human beings there are some people who are not normal human beings one of them was Moses to the extent Moses mared out of the word and when God came down to Moses he said nothing about it nothing it was breaking the word as at the as they knew it but God said nothing about but his sister and his brother Aon and his sister and the minister they all against him how could Moses sin how but they did not understand that Moses was no longer Moses God had taken Moses to another position God had spoken to Moses and he had said to him I'll make you God so the law was the law [Music] in Hues was at another level he was was he was no longer under the law there is something I to he was no longer under the law he was above the law he was the law himself and when they when they accused him of sin God was silent he was wondering what are they talking about no he Sean woman God said nothing I don't see anything he has he no longer of your type is above you and when they God rebuked all of them that he even cast them they became leapers even his sister mes was the one who had to intered for imagine that kind of power now God is saying to them that he justifi he has removed them from the of the Comm and he has glorified them there are people on Earth here who are glorified hallelujah how are they glorified they are no longer commoners because he says in his word you are Kings he also says you are priests you need to understand this should call Lage or this level of Kings and Priests was the most sac in all Israel kings were special men priest were special men but you are both of them but remember Jesus was the first born of this order of kings and priest because he's the king of kings and he the high priest of our confession so then he says but you you are Kings and Priests you are a royal priesthood you are a pecul god do you understand what I'm talking about you are PE people you are not normal you are not there are things you should no longer walk in Comm will walk in in sin but you you are called out of there you are special you are glorified as a matter of fact he said you are in Heavenly places you are no longer on Earth no no no no no no no in Christ you are in Heavenly PR when others are crying poverty you have money that is not from the the bank of Uganda money that can come out of a mouth of a fish what are you talking about this is a a special something you are not going to cry like others when others are saying sin is finishing you are going to say a different story you will have the says and they sang a new song have a new song no no no no no sin cannot finish me I am a royal priesthood I am a PR Nation I am a king and I'm a priest I am called by God because he for knew me he predestinated me because he predestinated me he has also called me because he called me he has Justified me because I'm Justified I am glorified I am not going to live in sin I am going to live a even when I'm tempted I even when I fall I because I'm a different person I am one like the the is not worth of me I'm a special man I'm a special woman Tes Revelation understand who you are praise God you need to understand we are a people that are not common us praise God Peter comes to Jesus and he says Jesus there is no money Jesus was like they can't understand what I've made understand he says Peter what are you doing I'm a fisherman okay okay I made you a fish of men but while you fishing men through that fishing you going to do a special fishing Peter fished all his life but he has never he had never fished money so now you're going to fish money so you can know when I make you a fish of means is told him Peter go and fish his fishing was different others were fishing but also Peter fish his fishing was different and when he fished he fished money he fished a fish which had money in the M who put that money there that manone also had Bank of Uganda it even had a number Jesus is not a scammer so how did that did it bypass everything God created it there in his own way what I'm saying is this whatever God has called you to be and you find yourself a student others will be studying but you will stud a different way others will be teaching but you will teach a different way other will be a business people but you will be a businessman a business woman in a different way your money will come AB that is what I'm trying to talk about you will receive money that is over and Beyond what your business can give you this is how it is supposed to be if it is not that way it is because you do not understand your are god-given Authority I am telling you we have people in this world are not living at the masses of [Music] governments they are not living at the masses of families Liv the mes of societies Church Hallelujah there are people that we call it living by a miracle it is not a miracle more than a miracle is more than a miracle if you don't know those people one of them and I tell you you can also be one of that even all the businesses you ear put together you put together it cannot make you what you are feed you what you eat because the food you eat is more than what man gives man shall not live by bread alone have a secr kind of food because we are different people am I talking in Tong don't you see what I'm saying God has glorified you you don't live at the mes of men you don't go begging he don't go asking he don't go pulling God is able to from n this is the God we ser and when he gives you a vision start this start start a company God has already given you Capital that capital is not money that is in you God has already placed everything you need in you Peter needed was to go and fish Peter had everything he needed the knowledge was in him the ideas was in him how to fish brother if I give you a fishing can you fish when I was in Zimbabwe I learned how to fish and my first time fishing I fished two fish and I was excited when I came to Uganda I bought fishing rods I started going to Victoria every fish and when I went there the first day I fish the first fish and it came out and it went away with my hook and I saw it but it just went with my hook and I've never fished another fish that means I'm not an experienced fisherman but Peter was experienced when God comes to you to you in what you know so don't think that Peter had what it took to get what he needed it was in him but he did not know it is in you but you don't know what God has given you oh my God oh my God hallelujah amen this Revelation is burning out me if you pray for me God will bring it out and he says here in verse three Ephesians 1 blessed be the god of the father of our Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with spiritual blessings in Heavenly places tell your neighbor in heaven places where are the demons in hell where are you Heavenly plac where are your blessings Heavenly plac Hallelujah don't allow the devil to bring you down into the depth of depression that is why the devil fights hard to make us go down go down in Anger go down in depression go down in sadness go down in dis disgust we go down in heart breaks we go down until we feel we can't do anything because he knows that your blessings are in Heavenly places but brother sister when the Devil comes to you like a I want to remind you the Bible says the spirit of God lifts a standard lift the stand the stand to where to Heavenly plac to where your blessings are hallelujah amen oh my God according as he has chosen Us in him oh my God I love that brother oh Jesus he has chosen us let me change that and I say he has chosen me chosen me in him if you want to know how it feels safe he has chosen me how do you feel reality Hallelujah he has chosen me in here before the foundation of the world that I should be holy if he chose me in him to be holy then I must be holy nothing can stop me from that no Devils can stop me from that no weapons of the enemy stop me from being holy I must be holy tell your neighbor you must be holy you must be holy not because you want to but he chose you in [Music] him my God and without blame for him in love another inspiration just I'm sorry I just act like a mad person because because I'm hearing from another world there are two people on Earth there is one that is called serpent SE they even if they want to be holy they don't have that in them the world will still overpower them but there is another group of people even if they want to be a sinner they will even try it they can't make it because the seed of God the word of God Willer them Hallelujah am the devil tried to get you in sin but he couldn't keep you in why because you are a seed of God he CH you in him to be holy Oh Glory to God [Music] without blame him I love this next work [Music] in his love is unconditional his love cannot fail God was not playing the lottery he was doing a sure business he knew the end from the beginning God could not have chosen you in him yet he knew he was going to lose you how many of you feel like you're falling you don't need to raise up your hand but if you feel like you're falling I have good news for you if you believe God chose there is no way you can fall there is no way you can fall why because when God sees and he looks at you he's not bothered that's why many times you have prayed go take me out of this take me out of this and God just looks and he smiles he says doesn't know what they're talking about I know I know you must reach the finishing L I know I saw you I saw you reaching there you must arrive there nothing can stop

he loves you and because he Lov you he CH you in before the foundation of the hallelujah hallelujah in the message God know the end from the beginning God knew the end from the beginning if you think about that it ought to make you shout it ought to make you feel different God knew the end from the beginning let's think about it for a moment God knew the end from the beginning tell your neighbor God knew the from the beginning God knew the end beginning verify he could plan everything that it would work out just to his glory and that that gives us courage to know that no matter what comes oh go God is making everything the clock is ticking the clock is just exactly on time if the devil has been oppressing you let me tell you such Moments When Faith is in the C it's a time for you to stand on your feet and begin to pray while I preach and say Yes Lord yes Lord you making everything for my the time is taking it is right on time never let never let God is not let some of you think God has delayed you I have a word for you today God is never left God is on time hallelujah amen sometimes we get weary we get upset we get weary we get upset we get history we think oh we must do this we must do that but remember God is clock will be just exactly on [Applause] time all these things has to be this way hey all these things in your Liv has to be this way God is not God is not God is on [Music] time praise God it has to all be done according to his great knowledge for knowledge by for knowledge for by for [Music] knowledge he could [Music] predestinate not by his desire but his [Music] knowledge you didn't understand that brother now I know you are going to get married I know I know it's not a prophec it's nothing now the question is do I desire it do I desire it I may desire it or I may not but know do you get the difference God when you know you have a fact you have a proof the reason why I know you have a girlfriend already you have anoun here God bless you now to each of you things in your life is mysterious but God knows he has seen the end it's not something he desires he desired that he predestinated You by desire but he [Music] knew God by his knowledge he does not predestinate by [Music] desire he didn't desire for your end to be the way it is going to be but he only knew because he's God he predestinate he he is not willing that any should perish for by but by his for knowledge he knew who would accept it and who would not therefore he can make everything work according to his big time clock that is taking away Hallelujah that's why he got to that man called what was his name Judas he knew because he was God are you hearing me he told him one of you is going to betray me he didn't desire but he knew it he said one I'm giving [Music] sir said not me he said Judas what you have to do do quickly why because Judas knew what he wanted to do but before Judas did not praise God before Jesus gave Judas [Music] that Judas did not know that he was going to be but when he said one of you is going to betray me said who not me said not me Judas what you have to do do quickly because now Jesus knew that Judas has now known and Judas walked away from there and betrayed him I believe even at the last minute Judas thought he was playing a game so he can get money out of it but Jesus already knew how he was going to end he had to kill himself but for you God also knows your end and that's why he has brought the word to tell you don't worry about what you're going so because is God he for the end from the beginning that's why when a preacher comes preaching by under inspiration God can give him a word of knowledge will speak to you directly word of what God is the one who knows your life so the word of Knowledge from God you and then you'll be say how good the man was speaking about my life not a man it is God who was telling you about your life therefore when it comes to you don't just be surprised then people begin maybe someone told him oh people unbelievers when God speaks and the word Des you just that say Amen to that receive the promise of that and God will do something for you if you're fighting something and the preure talks about it it means God has brought Deliverance to you God would come in the meeting of brother and he would talk about design call people names tell them what they going through tell them what is happening in their life and tell who told you who told me that I don't know you you've never seen it is God and this word itself is a designer of the thoughts and int of don't say God cannot do it for you when he has come to do it for you he has had plans for this day he has plans for every day and never has one of his plans ever failed he is always on time I said God chose you before the foundation of the world being God he all your future all your imperfections he knew all your imperfections he knew all your difficulties he knew all your failures but he also knew you seen a seed in you and his confidence was in that se and I want to Proclaim to you this morning you are greater than you know Hallelujah brother po you are greater than you know you are greater than you know do you even understand what I'm talking about because me I'm not understanding it right now but God is speaking to you church and God is telling you you are greater than you know how dare you say you can't make it what is in you is much greater than you hallelujah amen you are greater than you know the fact that you were elected by God that election by God means that he loved you here is your proof of that he chose you he elected you he loved you he knew you would not be a failure someone preach with me this morning he knew you would not be a qu he knew you would not be a sinner he knew you would not be a blasphemer he knew you not be a backslider god knew you would not be hypocrite Hallelujah am and if you hypocrite this morning I'm speaking to you by the authority of God is word

have authority by the word of God to tell you you are not a failure and I cast out that Spirit of failure in the name of Jesus Christ that Spirit of sinning God knew you not be a sinner you are not a sinner you are not a hypocrite you are not a drunker you are not a lustful person last has no authority over your you will not be an immoral person there that speed of immorality just loses outes you right now because God knew you would be an over hallelujah hallelujah God has so much confidence God has so much confidence in his choice he saw the end from the very beginning he saw you so perfect hallu my God hallelujah my God am he saw you so perfect oh my God I'm just trying to contain myself I feel like crying right now God so you so perfect that he took your name before the found and he

or two times you'll be tired you try to give up you will cry you will SN but at the end of it all hallelu at the end of it so you are the finishing life hallelujah amen your life is in God's hands

that is where he belongs and all his demons cannot hinder the purpose of God our for our for our child for your spirit God is purpose must come to pass the devil can't hinder it that is the proof of his love hallelujah hallelujah amen that is the proof of God is love election he chose you out of the many because he had so much confidence Hallelujah I want to finish with this quot in the message Church h now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I know I know what you're going through I am not at all unmindful of your suffer if God loves me why did you this happen to me why does he let this bad feelings come in my body and I feel why why why if God loves me why take it away I know I knower I know why am I poor m is difficult don't even have I know why is my family in problems my husband I am not at all mindful I'm not un mindful of your suffering and he says what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God just be so loving and if he stands by and watch people what they asked in Mal 1 1 to says the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Mal I have loved you us was not es Jacob's brother say the Lord yet I love and I hat and laid his mountains and his Heritage W for the dragons of the Wilderness I it West for the his Heritage was made West for the dragons of the Wilderness because he didn't love him but he loved you your heritage will not be made W no you see they could not figure out God's love thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with a parental care God that his love was elective love the proof of his love is that no matter what happened no matter what happens in your life his love was proven truly by the fact that we were chosen unto salvation Hallelujah because God has chosen you me to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you suffering as he did job that is his prerogative his own good pleasure he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace work together for good to them that love God and according to his purpose there is a purpose to everything that is happening in life quit questioning God Ming and crying sh stop that Church begin thanking God and moving on your life is in his hands whatever happens in your life is for a purpose I knew this ear in my life and that make me to keep my head focused I don't care what TR the devil for me I don't care what lack I have I don't care what problems I have I am one person who doesn't care what people talk about me I don't care sometimes I hear it and I'm like okay you think so it's all right and then you see he's guilty that's why say anything why say anything if God is on my side who can be against me if God is on your side fight your batt let him fight your battles his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect we may be established we may be strengthened we may be settled as job said he put strengthen strengthen us you see praise God what does God want for
