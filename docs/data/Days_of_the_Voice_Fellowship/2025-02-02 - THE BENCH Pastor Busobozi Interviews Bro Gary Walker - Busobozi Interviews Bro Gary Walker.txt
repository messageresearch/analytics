TRANSCRIPT
========================================
h for well greetings to you our viewers we are so happy to be back again with you here at the bench uh uh many years ago God gave me the grace of meeting with a man of God a precious Brother Gary Walker in Ethiopia at the time I was a pastor there with my wife and U God gave us the opportunity to meet with them and since then uh We've get we've got to know him and we are so blessed today to host him here at the bench Brother Gary Walker is a brother of course in Christ is a father to several children he will tell us how many and he's a grandfather as well of several children and he's a pastor of Living Word Tabernacle in brisban Australia uh join me today to welcome him and uh I think we'll just start right away and I have you brother Gary greet the people you welcome to the bench with pastori we've been doing this for quite a while now and I think this is the seventh episode okay would you please uh greet the people well God bless you uh it's a privilege to be here with the buzz greetings from Australia and uh we're this is very new to me so we're uh we're looking forward to see how this goes amen well we believe it will go very well uh we just feel relaxed we just want to have a little conversation um and just around the word and share the grace and the uh you know your life testimony is very touching to me and I believe it will be very touching and a blessing to uh many of our generation I told Brother Gary that we we do this bench because I feel that there is a lot that God has done in the past in the years past among these brothers that really have had a real walk with the Lord and many of our younger generation have missed out because not many have got an opportunity to hear or to know what God has done in the past but if we can be able to know what God has done in the past then we can be able to know and understand what God is doing in our time because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so um I think I'd like us to just maybe for the people to get to know a little bit about you um this message that we preach that God sent a prophet in our generation to restore our faith back to the faith of the apostolic fathers how did you come to this message I think that's a good place to start yeah that's a good question uh we were living in Western Australia at the time and my mom and dad uh got to know a brother who introduced a message to my my parents and uh my parents never really got along too well uh growing up there was always a little bit of friction in the family and uh my mom and dad uh got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ gave their hearts to the Lord they were Storch Catholics and I remember one day uh them coming home and the pope was no longer God he was now the devil which was amazing to us you know and uh were they Catholics they were Catholics stor Catholics yeah okay and uh I remember walking into the kitchen at home when I was a young fellow and uh seeing my mom and dad uh hugging each other and this this was new you know this is working for them so uh I didn't really know I didn't understand really what they had got themselves into but my brother came back and he was in the Army in Australia and he went along to church as well and he came back baptized as well then my younger brother went and he came back baptized and I thought they were all har Krush or uh some cult you know so they invited me to come and talk to this brother Steve Allison and I thought well I'll go rescue the family and so I went to Brother Steve's house and we were there at about 10:00 in the morning and 10:00 in the evening I was in the water I surrendered my life Jesus Christ and I was baptized as well so uh that's that's how it all started uhuh and uh were you ministering were you into Ministry at the time or you just freshh no I was a worldly just an Angry Young Man uh this was all very new to me uh I just speaking to uh brother Steve Allison who introduced the message to me he had answers you know which was which was strange the Catholic priests didn't have answers and religious people didn't have a lot of answers and serpent seed really struck my heart this was just seemed to be common sense uh anointed ones at the end time and various different things that we spoke about just seemed it just resignated and uh what could I do it was amazing and and you just answered another question right there I was going to ask you what really struck you most that really made you to receive the revelation of this word yeah so I remember uh because we were dragged up Catholics the last time I went to uh the Catholic church I asked the priest if Adam and Eve were the only two people on Earth where does everybody come from and he said well you don't have to believe that story and and I thought well what do you believe you know and so that was the last time I went to church and I was about maybe 15 I suppose and I just wandered off into the world and I was just doing very worldly things at that time and by the time I was about 20 years old I think it was 1989 actually summer of 1989 that's where I seemed to stumble across the message but we know that it was predestination yes and uh that's where I I got the answers to the questions and uh what could you do when you're presented with the truth but just humble yourself to it and uh that's how it's up but but no I wasn't a preacher or anything like that and that's 1999 19889 89 sorry yeah uh so uh you of course speaking to you I I learned that uh you are an originally an African yes I was born in South Africa so where we're brothers yeah amen I just thought I should say that being that you're in Africa I mean you would feel very happy to know that you are African yeah yeah I'm so glad so you you live South Africa not in the Catholic church at the time oh yes yes my mom and died were Catholics yeah from the beginning yeah from the beginning so in 1989 the light uh strikes your heart and then you get to know the revelation of this message and so um how then did you um get into the ministry well uh there was the last thing I was looking for um the absolute last thing I was looking for but uh one day I remember I sister Deborah was my my wife she since passed away but I remember she was fixing her hair in the mirror as as the sisters do and I walked behind her and it was that point the Lord called me to the ministry I don't I can't give you an accurate description of what took place but right there at that very instant I knew that God had called me to the ministry and my heart broke and uh because that's not what I wanted I wasn't a public person I wasn't a public speaker I was quite shy I didn't like crowds but I knew that God had called me to the ministry and I collapsed back onto the bed and Deborah this my wife said to me what what what's wrong and I said to I remember saying to her uh the Lord just called me to the ministry and she laughed and I really I don't blame her because she knew my background and uh my my personality type you know and it I just seemed to be the last person that you would pick to to be a public speaker M and I was very disappointed with the Lord I really was uh I thought the Lord had made a mistake I remember honestly I remember I said to the Lord I said this is must be your first mistake yeah uh I won't tell anybody you won't tell anybody nobody will find out and we'll leave it at that but it just uh things evolved now uh being that we are addressing a younger like I said I keep saying that younger generation there are two pertinent questions that I would like to put to you one and while you tell us your life story and you know what you have gone through this is not something you're preaching because you see uh young people here preachers they get to hear preachers and they hear someone after someone and sometimes it doesn't really make sense to them in a way that of relating directly to them and in understanding that this is someone's life is really telling this life but what this bench does is you get to speak you get to speak to us by your life and so um talking about Ministry and we get to the one of marriage afterward talking about Ministry because there are very many even now listening to you wondering how do I know that the has called me Min and then how do I get respond to that so what was it that actually happened to you at that moment that press your but the know that's very good question and I would have to say that it's Case by Cas so I don't think there's a rule of thumb or a measuring stick that we can use uh if you have a if you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ uh I would suggest to you because it's not an absolute because like I say everybody's different uh it will be uncomfortable it will be confusing uh and don't think that you're alone and don't think it's strange it's just that being called to the ministry is a very Supernatural thing it it it would be nice if the Lord would send you a text first to prepare you or uh but you know it's just an uncomfortable place to be in fact it's quite a horrifying place to be because normally God uses uh people that are the least equipped for the job amen so don't feel that there's some magic measuring Rod or that there's some formula or some silver bullet um you just have to relax and just go with the flow and right there you say that uh you felt that God had made a very big mistake I knew it yes it's not something you thought you really knew it it appears that every man that God calls into the life of service actually thinks that God has made a mistake Moses did Paul did brother bham did and what is this that made you feel well we know what made brother bam feel that way brother Paul and you know Moses what is it that made you feel that you were not the right Peak okay that's a good question as well brother buz uh when I was too shy to get up in church just to give a testimony just to give a testimony just to give a testimony I wouldn't do it uh I didn't like crowds I was quite a backward person I was a loner uh it's just just I'm amazed that the Lord picked me so are you saying Brother Gary are you trying to suggest to us today that God can actually call a shy person into the absolutely and he use them absolutely amazing and so well you mentioned uh earlier about sister Deborah and and when it Dawn on you that God had called you to the ministry you were with her and you told her she left well God gave me the opportunity to meet her then I do not remember the year but about seven or eight years ago when you came to Ethiopia and with her and I was able to interact with her and talk a little bit I found that she was a true Christian and so how then did you get to know her in the very beginning were you in the message then or were you not yet in the message no uh so like I said I gave my heart to the Lord in about 1989 yes I went to church and that's where I met sister Deborah and I remember uh the first time we met uh I I CU I was I was the type of uh guy that would go sit at the back you know that type of a guy I didn't want to be sitting at the front I didn't want to be seen I just want to be leave me alone I just want to do my thing and I remember walking past sister Deborah and there was an empty seat next to her and she had her Bible like this and she saw me coming with my my leather jack cuz we used to ride bikes my leather jacket and my boots and uh she got her Bible and put her Bible on the seat next to her and uh I thought to myself don't worry girl I'm not sitting there and that was the first time we met yeah it was in church yeah and then quickly uh things changed and uh things things changed and we were married uh December 1991 praise the Lord did this track you right there at that moment no came much later yeah now uh there's something else this might look a little silly but um uh being in the mission field especially in my country I've seen this kind has been quite a thing um you say that you were seated almost next to her and all that uh is is that um sitting like the sitting arrangement in the church because I I I know Muslims women sit on one side and Men sit on on the other yeah uh what do you say about that uh it's all about modesty um I've been to churches where they have the brothers on one side like Eastern Eastern Europe yeah uh some Churches even in Africa uh I do not know that in Europe it's that way I've seen it here in some Churches not not not every not not all but every church is Sovereign yeah and it's only an issue if you want it to be an issue yeah uh we come to church to hear the word you know and if people are comfortable with men on one side and women on the other side it's not a problem but uh uh so yeah every church is Sovereign and every church has a right to worship God the way the way they want yeah yeah so really it's not a shame it's not it's not a Doctrine exactly so now uh you mentioned about how you met then you eventually got married and I'm sorry to you know keep going back to that you're dealing with the younger people here how would a young man know that she is absolutely the right one mhm okay Case by case remember yeah I remember uh for myself so I'm speaking for myself the Lord told me uh and when the Lord speaks to you it's not necessarily words uh even brother Bram said it could be Impressions it was probably going to be Impressions So when you say the Lord spoke to me uh I said the Lord impressed upon me that sister Deborah was the one for me I cannot say I was madly in love with her and I cannot say that she was madly in love with me and I would uh strong suggest to you uh don't marry for love yeah because when Love Runs Out what are you going to do if you marry by Revelation When the Love Runs Out uh then instead of falling back on commitment you can fall back on on the Lord's plan exactly yeah so uh if you are born again you must be born again before you uh before you get married yes because if you're born again you have agape love yes now if you're married just with fio love when fio Love Runs Out you have to fall back on commitment yeah gape love never runs out yeah so so so I can say I can say I was happily married for 29 years yes we never had an argument praise the lord we we disagreed because we're human beings yes uh but we never had a screaming match we never had uh something that the neighbors could hear uh you must be born again before you get married just make sure you're born again and don't marry for love yeah yeah yeah marry by Revelation you of course of course you'll be in love yes you're be in love but don't but don't do it just for that because love will run out you know Pastor Gary have found that what many young people call love is actually just I don't know if I would be right to say last last fulfilling which can quickly wear off and but you see love covers a multitude of sins not not feel love not feel love perfect love yes God is own love and and you know um so they need to have agap love God is own love you know you what's the difference you know brother Buzz uh Jesus was with Judas for three and a half years and never fuss if love can tame a wolf what about a wife or a husband yeah so if you are truly born again with a gap love with the love of God I'm talking about Corinthians 13 love which is not easily offended yes if you have that in your heart you are able to step back and humble yourself rather than feeding your own ego that makes the marriage work uh many things are going through my head right now I don't know which direction we should take but I'll just be led by the holy spirit because you see talking about that this is really helping many talking about that because we've had an issue uh with the basis of marriage and many think or say it is love love love love but just say love blindly without exactly knowing what kind of love we talking about but you brought in something there where you said uh if someone is not born again they cannot have that agap love so should we then encourage young people not even to enter into marriage relationships until they're born again absolutely absolutely yeah that like there's no long answer to that it's just yes amen yeah so you heard it right there young person if you are not born again do not start relationship because you're starting the relationship on the wrong basis and then you eventually find out later on it doesn't actually work the man yep because if if you get married say if the brother gets married because uh the sister has a lovely figure what happens when the lovely figure is no longer no longer a lovely figure if uh if he uh brought you chocolate and Roses uh he better make sure the chocolate and the Roses keep coming and keep coming and keep coming uh the moment they stop the love stop yeah that's right that's a good one right that you want to add something on that I'll get myself in trouble well what I can say on this in on this bench interview do not hold yourself Pastor Gary there's quite a lot in you I must warn you young people Brother Gary is a a teacher of the word and he has not told me that I I could tell that by are sitting under his ministry for these past several days we have had him in the country and just uh sit your tie your seat belt and and get ready for what the Lord has for you on this bench interview this is one of the kind I believe we will have or will have we have ever had now uh I think it's the right basis to get into your testimony right there when you talked about your wife and how you had you've never had you never had an argument for the 29 years you were married that's right and I could tell because I have a book in my hands uh and the title is three times dead but still alive three times dead but still alive brothers and sisters we are seated on the bench today with a man who died three times but still alive and this book was written by none other than but by the woman that he loved and married and became the mother of his children and a grandmother of his children and um I've not read it all because I we had very short of a time I've I've listened to your testimony on video but I've not read this book before and now that I have it I've read a few chapters and part of what I read here is because this was written by her and and you know they had um and you will tell us the whole story but uh this is a story or a testimony of the power of God what God can do uh because we believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever but Gary all over the world has been known by this testimony mostly what God did for them what God did for him and his family and it's not been easy and today we want to sit back relax and hear it all if you can tell it all from the beginning to the end Brother Gary feel free to do that but you see they had they had a terrible accident and the the circumstances upon which they had the accident maybe he will tell that but there is this part that really moved me that the sister wrote in this book as she said I can only describe what happened and this is now in the in the during the the accident when they were having that accident because she was in the car with him and their daughter one of their daughters I can only describe what happened next as being a thought that spoke to me and said brother bham laid his hand on sister Meda because at that moment it appears that Brother Gary had already passed out or actually died so she says I tried to do this but my arm refused to move you remember how brother B in the accident you know tried to lay his hand upon his wife and you know she she came back to life and so she tried to also push her hand to lay it upon brother gar uh but she could not move the hand cuz she was also in pain and of course maybe the hand had an injury I do not know we'll hear more about that yeah and she says I I tried to reach over with my left hand but I couldn't reach I gained this thought said it doesn't matter I began to pray loudly with no hysteria or fear that life and healing would flow through Gary and you know I imagine what love what would be that that would cause her to do that in such a circumstance I believe it was the love of God I believe it was the same thing that moved by the bham it was more than a gift it was you know the love of God in his heart that prayed over brother uh sister Meda and you know she came back to life and the same thing happened here sister Deborah prayed you know out loud ly for Brother Gary and he came back to life I think this was the very first moment that you came back to life and maybe you can tell us what happened before this and then also the other three two times and maybe just speak and tell us your testimony whatever so uh uh so I'm married to this uh sister Deborah right uh we never had a contract uh of a marriage and I say a contract in that we weren't married uh 5050 you do your 50% I'll do my 50% that's a contract uh a a true marriage is 100% 100% uh you take a vow for better for worse um so you can uh you can pick up you can pick up where and sister de was a perfect example of that uh we we were driving home driving home from church actually i' I'd been preaching for a brother up north and um as we were as we were driving I looked behind me and I saw my daughter had taken the diagonal part of the seat Bel off and put behind her just still wearing the lap and I said to Hannah I said Hannah put the seat belt on properly and I remember watching her put the seat belt on properly and that's the last thing I remember uh what had happened was a truck had come around the corner a logging truck uh was overloaded going too fast and his back trailers rolled into our lane and we were doing 100 kilm an hour one way he was doing 110 the other and uh we we collided and uh my car rolled and rolled uh I've seen the police reports uh and I don't know if you seen a picture of the car it looks like a bomb's gone off yeah in inside it uh I was dead uh sister Deborah being a nurse she she recognized that her and Hannah started to pray fervently um uh I mentioned the seat belt because the only the only uh uh injury that my daughter sustained was the lap diagonal left a a bruise on her on her body it caught her and I just said put the thing on Prop you so I than the Lord you so we we uh we hit the truck I died the car was ack sister deborra receiv injuries de prayed somebody arrived first person on the scene was a paramedic the Lord's got everything under control and they put a uh a thing down my throat to keep the open um and by the ambulance had arrived I died again and the paramedics had written out on and I have the piece of paper at home at at 10 minutes to 5 uh in the afternoon I six and they put ACR myp Hospital bring me back so that was three times in one day I died yeah and uh so I I was left in a coma and the doctor's report to my wife which by the way sister de was an ex nurse the report to my wife was uh he's not going to make it he's going to he's going to die it's just it's just the injuries he sustained were too Grievous and uh when I didn't die they said to they said to my wife well it looks like he's going to live but he's going to be a vegetable he won't be able to think he won't be able to talk he won't be able to move he'll be sitting in a wheelchair for the rest of his life and that is the very best diagnosis we can give but as you can see the grace of God uh said something else and I see right here in the book uh it says later when going through a bag containing Gary's blooded clothes that had been cut off him and a few other items my sister found a piece of paper and on piece of paper was written these words Gary Walker 25969 that is his birthday 63 P drive that's the the address where they were living and uh 1646 1650 is this the time yes 1655 and then 1712 l meaning loss of consciousness 1748 deceased 1805 so they actually this is actually a medical report yes that had announced you deceased deceased what was cuz I mean like I've had this before but I've always waited to meet you so I can ask you what did the doctor explain after giving a report that you were deceased and it turned out that you came back to life like what did they say about that uh they say nothing that they're very careful uh they have to maintain a professional uh appearance and uh their reputation is at risk so they're very very careful like a good politician uh they can say a lot of stuff without saying stuff uh I asked the doctor after I'd come out of the coma and I because I spent nine months in a hospital I asked the doctor I said hey uh you've seen what happened and you know the all the diagnosis and you know I'm not supposed to be able to talk you know I'm paralyzed on the left hand side you you know all the diagnosis but now you see what you see I said to the doctor if you haven't got it in you to say the Lord Jesus Christ can't you at least admit intelligent design I tried to ran off as nicely as I could for him and he said no so they they yeah they didn't want to to say anything after that but you see I think that they also recognized the miracle some some did some did some did some yes some wouldn't some wouldn't but but anyways what God has done cannot be undone what God has has done I I mean um during that time I I wouldn't know I I don't know whether this is the right great question to ask but do you remember anything no no no I remember uh being in a coma and I could hear every now and again something I remember my daughter Hannah saying to the nurse why has the Machine gone to green and another voice said that's because your dad is breathing for himself and now remember the last thing I remember is driving my car and now I'm unable to move I'm unable to open my eyes uh I'm in a coma and I'm hearing somebody say that's because dad's breathing for himself now and I thought Lord what has gone on yeah so um when I came out of the coma I did not remember my wife I did not remember my children I didn't remember anything but I could remember the message of the hour my God because the message is in the subconscious my God the mind was so damaged they said I would be unable to think for the rest of my life that the head injury I sustained was so impressive that the every doctor said no he will not live so when I came out of the coma I couldn't remember anything I I just I had Amnesia but I could remember 1963 the cloud I could remember 1933 the pillar of fire I could remember the quotes I could remember the paragraph numbers I could remember I could remember because these things are in the subconscious yeah you know in thean church age uh brother banam says a few things about suffering and um uh there's even uh some kind of gospel uh these days well of course it's been a while among the Pentecostal group that if you are suffering it means that God is not with you and if everything is going well it means that uh you are blessed and God is with you uh I I believe that you are the best man that can talk about suffering um as much as brother bham says here and I I'll quote Maybe before you answer that he says for I Rec that I think it's a scripture that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reain because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to now I believe that you you attained a certain uh magnitude and level of character through these things that you suffered through the pain through all all of that what would you have to say about these things uh I can say I love you you can say you love me those are just words but love can only be proven in unlovable circumstances you can only prove your love to God when it seems like he's turned his back on you there's no that is pure worship when God has gone silent on you when life turns itself upside down when you feel like you're up against the wall and God has forgotten you because I was convinced that uh God's the Supreme anger of God and the Supreme perfect Judgment of God was upon me because of the pain that I was going through uh I I couldn't talk sometimes because of the pain if somebody walked past me and the hair on my feet move I would scream uh the pain was so well I just can't describe it but that was my opportunity to prove to God I love them if you look at a hill far away Calvary God proved his love to us the only way you can prove your love is in unlovable circumstances so if everything's going good okay but if everything's going bad and you still maintain your testimony and you still Worship the Lord okay now you prove something to the Lord and that's rich to God that's worth something to God if I had a computer and uh I programmed it to say I love you it's somebody uh who in their own free will says to me I love you in an unlovable circumstance it's worth something to me and if you can love God in unlovable circumstance that's rich to God and we cannot love God without loving our neighbor our brother and um you know many Believers think that uh they can love God but hate those who hate them well they Believers but as long as they hate them they don't like them very much they can also dislike them or Hur them um I believe you are the man that can answer that because you've gone through it those people just wear the veneer of religion uh faith is based on forgiveness that's what the prophet tells us uh if you have unforgiveness in your heart you are wasting time coming to church you are wasting your time you're wasting everybody's time wasting God's time uh if you have unforgiveness in your heart you cannot work with faith because faith is based on forgiveness God God is love I'd like you to teach us more about forgiveness people have come up to me and I've preached to someone here on forgiveness but you see people keep keep on asking Pastor how can I forgive someone who has done something tangible something that has ruined my life something that has how can I really take it in my heart to genuinely say I forgive them I can't I just can't do that how do you advise such a person be born again yep if you are born again so a lot of people we the veneer of religion they they they wear a mask of you know they're nice people when everything is nice but when everything is not nice they are not nice it's religion it's just religion uh there is a reality in the new birth that's what it's called the New and Living Way It Is it is real it changes your character three nurses came into my room when I was in the hospital and they said Mr Walker okay we want to know what is the difference and I said I said ladies what are you talking about and they said you have been in so much pain and you have never sworn you have never hit anybody you have always been a gentleman what's the difference and I thought here we go three baptisms coming up M and I said that's because I'm born again and that's where they didn't want to know about it but they could identify something different you know so if you can't forgive you have to get on your knees and ask for the reality of the Gospel uh if you have the spirit of Jesus Christ in you remember Jesus lived with the devil for three and a half years and never fast it's only an issue if you want to feed your ego you know when you spoke about that I I'm trying to uh locate the portion cuz I had not yet highlighted it where uh you know when the paramedics I think they were when they came to carry you carry you away and your wife shouted said okay said that you're going to get an ambulance she shouted no get get a helicopter because she had seen how you were and then you know she was praying the whole time and as she was praying this man came and I think was cursing or speaking some bad words um and she was in pain you know she could have said anything in that moment being a child of God but she shouted back God forgive you yeah yeah so I wasn't there obviously I was uh I was either dead or in a coma but um yeah she had broken her arm and I see I saw the x-rays the humorous was the broken in half and the ball the socket had turned upside down so the ball was down and a broken the spiky part was up in the socket the pain that that must have put sister DEA through and she was laying on the side of the road in that much pain praying for me yeah yeah I noticed that yeah and then the partic was an atheist and he said to her oh that's not going to do anything yeah and uh that's when she asked the Lord to forgive him yeah yeah that's called the real deal yeah the only way we can be able to test our faith that we really are believers is when we are in such circumstances and many Christians are good Christians in church as long as everything is going well but when things be go begin to go south then they forget that they Christians you have to suffer that's just pain and simple uh because character is a victory it's not a lot lot like you just wrot uh you just read out if you're are truly born again it's automatic all the Sheep knows is e grass and the wol will take care of itself so I'm not trying to be nice I'm not trying to be forgiving I'm not trying to be religious I am it takes care of itself you have an instinct and Things become what quite the Propet automatically so forgiving is not a struggle when you're born again no no so in fact brother B said if somebody has offended you and they are in the wrong definitely in the wrong and you know you're in the right you still have to take that person uh before the Lord presence of the Lord and brother brandham said it might be your attitude that determines that person's Eternal destination he said they're absolutely wrong you are absolutely right but it's your attitude towards them in prayer may determine their Eternal so God God is depending on us to get to God for them before God gets to them for us because God said vengeance is mine sayth the Lord so God God's got a mercy seat on the Earth today called the blood of Jesus Christ so God is God is depending on us to get to him and ask for their forgiveness before he gets to them for us yeah my man that that sounds uh speaks volumes and uh with many having a form of Christianity a form of religion but not have in the life exactly so I believe that every Christian um who finds very hard to forgive others has a problem in the area of the new would I be right if I absolutely yes no long answer yes yes period if you have the spirit of Jesus Christ I tell you on a hill far away there's your example he said father forgive me in all that pain all that suffering knowing he had not done one thing wrong he and in know it's the same thing that also Steven did when they were storing him yeah and you know you said something when we were in carja on that as you're preaching can you please say that again uh that when when Steven was so full of the Holy Ghost that when he was taking the hard blows he was being stoned he he looked up uh and he said I see the son of man standing the Bible says that when Jesus rose from the dead he ascended up on high and sat down on the right hand of majesty when Peter when Steven said father forgive them for being stoned he he had done nothing wrong uh and he was taken the hard blows and I'm talking about you can you take the hard blows in life uh you should still be able to say father forgive me and Steven said I behold the son of a man standing he was sitting but he was giving step a standing ovation because Steven was doing exactly what Jesus had done so the master was saying that's exactly what I would have done or that's exactly how I played it or that's exactly like me they gave him a standing Evas because now he had a reflection of himself on the Earth where for doing nothing wrong for doing nothing wrong taking the hard blows in life he could have the attitude just to say father it's not an issue please forgive me remember it's only an issue if you wanted to be an issue yeah amen I I don't know whether you people got that or you missed that imagine that Steven is being stoned and you know you know they're kicking with with all Stones all over his face and flying all over his face and his body but you know uh he just says father forgive them and you know by saying that he looks and he sees the creator of Heaven and Earth standing he was not seated he was standing and the way brother brother Gary brought it is that that the creator of Heaven and Earth was giving him a standing OAS yes this is what I I I I I would have done this is what I did amen so it means it this the same thing that Jesus did when he was on Earth is the same same thing Steven did when when he was on Earth so it's the same thing we should do also forgive those who have hurt us and we have many in in Christianity people having bitterness you know holding bitterness you find even sometimes preachers have bitterness whereby when he comes to preach he really preaching the bitterness to the people and the people themselves become bitter because the minister has bitterness but when you release that I mean I've suffered this before and God delivered me you know when when you release that in your heart and you Minister you find that uh you know you Minister love you Minister forgiveness you Minister grace to the people and that impacts their life so I I I think you know uh when someone is born again they need to come to that place where they they are they love everybody if you're born again you will come to their place it will be automatic yeah uh yeah where they love everybody and no enemies does it my relationship with God is indicative to my relationship with the Brethren how can I love God and hate the you can say I love God but you have hate for somebody in your heart it's a lie you read you know it's a lie it's just the veneer of religion so my relationship with God is indicative of my relationship with the Brethren if I don't love the Brethren from a clean honest heart I do not love God and if you love your brother and your brother has offended you you're not going to keep it in your heart you're going to go over to them and say I'm offended here brother and I forgive you yeah you know you've released your heart how amazing offense Jesus said offense must come because uh this is the character this is the measure of the character of a man of a Christian you know that when offense comes I'm not going to feed my ego I don't need to protect my reput I don't need to uh fight back I don't need to bark back I don't need to protect anything I'm just more interested in their relationship with God so God is relying on me to get to him for them before he gets to them for me amen amen well that was a blessing to us so let's talk about this truck driver uhuh was it hard for you to forgive him no no it wasn't uh Roy his name is Roy Wilson what exactly happened like how did you get R over so Roy had rung up uh his his boss and said boss I'm not going to make it back to the depot in time uh because we've had issues at the loading B and his boss said Roy if you don't get back to this Depot on time you don't have a job so he was under pressure and everybody has at some stage broken the speed in there everybody has done stupid things everybody has done irresponsible things and unfortunately for Roy uh he was going a little bit too fast he was a little bit too overloaded and uh coming around the corner his trailers just rolled over yeah so a counselor said to me Mr Walker we need to do a psychiatric assessment on you and I said why is that and they said because you're too happy you're supposed to be sad they said they said we're concerned that there's some uh serious head injury there that is gone by misdiagnosed because you have a right to be angry and under normal circumstances you would be bitter and I said no no no I said look I fored all my rights when I became a Christian oh my praise so they said definitely now psychiatric assessment but we have something that the world knows nothing about you know uh I I met Roy my arm was in a brace because tenden to be torn off my shoulder my tricep the back of my arm had been torn off uh my ribs had been broken my shoulder blad had snapped in half so I was in a brace for three months and we met we we met Roy and he was genuinely sorry he was he was I consider his eyes you know he was tear he was teared up so I asked Deborah to take uh undo the straps of my arm and gently put my arm CU I couldn't move it put my arm on the table and I said Roy take my hand please I said I forgive you I said God forgave me I said as far as I'm concerned it's as if you never did it and everybody in the room broke them my God my God so we we uh we shook hands gently and sister de put my hand back in the brace and then I gave Roy P yeah is is is that man still living I don't know he went to jail uh he got sentenced to jail for 15 years uh cuz I I had I had uh officially died it was a man sort of touch uh but I wrote the judge a letter before the senten sentencing and I said I've met with Roy and I am convinced it was a genuine mistake we all make mistakes I said I don't hold anything against Roy I completely forgive him and I ask you to reflect that in your G so instead of getting seven years he got five 15 years he got five years okay okay so you could not be able to put him off the even the five years legally no yeah oh I said I forgive him I said I don't want him to go down it was just a mistake it was just an unfortunate mistake and they said but uh if you had have left home five minutes later this wouldn't have happened I said no I'm a Christian if I had left home five minutes later Roy would have left the depot five minutes later because brother Ram talks about predestinated Trial yeah did you hear that so so rather than being bitter just accept that all things work together for the good amen amen praise the lord well that's that's a blessing to me now being that U uh especially here in Africa many uh Christians suffer hardship and then they attribute it to many things um do you think that certain types of people maybe according to uh the place where they live or according to ethnicity or according to race or according to what do you think that certain groups of people are meant to suffer certain certain uh trials and and tests okay again that's Case by case uh it's no mistake it's nothing strange that you find yourself where you are you're not a mistake uh it's predestinated of God you're in the place where God predestinated you to be and all you need to do is take your circumstance and work it for your character whatever your circumstance is just work it for your character like God said to to Adam till the soil but he was living in Paradise why would want to till the soil it's it's just take your trial and work it just work it to your benefit uh if you are living in a first world country and you have all the first world blessings there's always somebody better off than you in the first world if you're in a third world there's always somebody off better than you and it just doesn't matter where you find yourself in don't compare yourself with somebody else just relax be comfortable in your own skin and know that God actually designed you to be where you are and you will reserved for a Time such as this and for a place such as this just work it to your benefit and it's all about developing character so that will be ready on WRA today amen so every everyone is the way God designed them to be yes sir um because because some young people have not accepted that you find uh that others will even do I mean how do they call it uh like changing the color of their skin you know using some kind of chemicals and others trying to um run away from their home or run away from their country I'm known I'm known as a great part because I believe that ugand is the best country you know I agree with it you agree with it I'm glad I got you on board so so you find that some people can't even work can't even think of what to do where God has placed them because they want to run up you know somewhere some other country uh the psychological statistics are that people that chase happiness end up being the most oppressed the only happiness that there is is in Jesus Christ people that try to better themselves and and I'm not say I'm not saying by no means am I suggesting that you don't try to better yourself I think you should but if you're trying to chase happiness brother Ram said life was not meant for being easy so if you find yourself in the first world or when I was in New Zealand uh and there was an economic crash a man got down to his last $5 million couldn't handle and committed suicide oh my God so it doesn't matter where you are is the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence it's uh people that chase happiness will never find it and they are statistically proven to be the most unhappy people at the end of their life they are the bitter ones that were chasing chasing a rainbow never finding what they were looking for your only true happiness is in Jesus Christ amen no matter where you are no matter what in the middle of the storm if you have the Holy Ghost yeah the true happiness is in Christ yes and so um these are nuggets Brother Gary and I know it's getting to my heart I hope it's getting to the hearts of the people who are here and those who are online um I I think these are very important words that we get to hear them sometimes I think even we as preachers have a temptation of preaching uh joy as uh the absence of suffering and test and hard life uh health wealth and prosperity is a devil's Doctrine uh the Bible says that God knows all our needs we know all our wants so I want I want everything that's going to make life better for me but God knows I need character so that means that I need hard times I need tests I need trials that's what I need so God said I know your needs and God said I will supply your needs I that's I am not going to supply my trials because I'm trying to make life comfortable so God said well because I know what's going to get you ready for a Rapture I know your needs so you uh you will never be able to dodge hard times you cannot Escape offense and trials will always be there there until The Bitter End but in the middle of the trial you can smile and really for worship to be something tangible to God is that when life itself turns itself against you just say hallelujah anyway Hallelujah anyway everybody say hallelujah anyway amen now uh I understand that the doctors say that you will never be able to uh see because you had issues with your eyes you couldn't see anymore uh you could hear what else couldn't you do couldn't speak you couldn't speak oh you couldn't speak even couldn't close my eyes you couldn't close your eyes um uh you couldn't walk couldn't walk uh couldn't roll over you couldn't roll over I couldn't use my left hand side completely completely you couldn't bend over no and the doctor said these things will never be restored against they were amazed that I had made it uh they were just amazed of the alive and they said these things are feminal absolutely feminal and uh I can walk I can talk I can close my eyes I can drive a car I can think I can remember you can drive a car yeah think about and and brother Buzz brother Buzz uh I took an IQ three IQ tests uh several years ago and I had a higher IQ Point than before the accident my God my God so this it's the grace of God it's a grace of God Amen so you can do everything the daughter said you will never be able to do again so what do you think that the situation and you know the devil has told you that you cannot be able to achieve or to do you know it's all a lie from the devil it doesn't matter what the devil says that you can't be able to achieve or can't be able to do if God says yes no one can say no if God opens the door no man can shut it here we have a testimony before us so we don't want to listen to what the devil has to say we already have seen what God has to say so throughout this process uh Brother Gary did you ever ask yourself why me because while you are answering that I want you to know that there are people going through other situations of life and they have that question oh God why be why me some others I w't even go to church again if God is good why didn't he take me through out of this situation okay if you have the attitude and God bless your hearts you know I'm your brother uh I'm not UNC christianizing you I'm not demonizing you but if you have the attitude for me why me I suggest you gra just just grab uh I was convinced that uh God's pure Divine hatred was upon me but I never felt sorry for myself I just thought I wonder what I've done wrong I just I wonder what I've done wrong and then one night on my right hand side the pillar of fire came into the into the bedroom the uh I was there by myself and they have even what they called uh even unbelievers experien what they call the pain Monster uh it's like the Yates gate Theory where the the uh nervous system can only take so much information and uh what what what seems to happen in the mind is that it it rolls out of the body and stands next to you even unbeliev testify it stands on your left hand side and it just waits for you to consume all this pain and then there's more coming so it's like sheep trying to get through a little gate thousands of sheep you can only get so many sheep through the gate at one time what the Y C and anyway that was happening to me at the time I was uh I was crying I was shaking I was uh in a a lot of pain the doctor said if we give you any morphine any more morphine it's going to turn your brain off so I was in that condition and then the P fire came in on the right hand side and I can't explain how it happens because uh the Unseen is more real uh I can't explain I I'll just tell you how it was okay uh it was a purifier but he had his arms folded but he had no arms and he leaned forward but it wasn't a body it was a pillar of fire uh and he said without saying it was uh he said will you worship me and I'm in this pain I am in pain that I can't describe and I couldn't talk and I thought in my mind I thought of course I worship you of course you know though he slame me joke though he slame me you all trust me regardless of what you find yourself in don't feel sorry for yourself if you do feel sorry for yourself uh read the scripture where Paul says when I was a child I did jish things yeah there's a growing up time so I said to the Lord of course I will and as soon as I thought those words the pain from the top of my head to the so of my foot flushed out completely no pain and when you've been in that much pain and then you're not in any pain it is sweet it is so sweet and then the pufi disappeared and two or three seconds later a nurse walked into my room she took three or four steps into the room and stopped and she said what has been going on in here because you get the anointing and I I was just lying there just smiling no pain just in such peace you know um just I say that not to Pat myself on the back or to give you some sort of spiritual resume I'm just saying don't feel sorry for yourself nothing good and comfortable yeah just all things work together for the good and he is always there yeah and just because he's silent doesn't mean he's absent praise the name of the Lord this is very encouraging you know uh instead of pitting yourself and you know feeling like uh you are in the worst situation because people have a tendency of thinking that look I'm the worst if you if you were where I was if you knew what I knew if you felt what I felt you would not have said that I feel I am very qualified to say the things that I do uh if uh if you've been through what I've been through then maybe you can do those yourself but until then don't do it yeah honestly nothing good can come from it you wear your own faith down uh it's just the veneer of religion if you've really been born again I mean I'm talking you've had a a real Encounter With Jesus Christ remember the woman at the well M she she went to fetch water from a well and found a well sitting on a well and Jesus was The Well of life he said if you drink of this water you'll never thirst again yes and when she knew that this was the promise the Bible says she dropped her water pots and ran into the town if you've really had an encounter with Jesus Christ there's going to be some stuff you're going to have to drop and the biggest one is going to be your pride in the amen praise God now now uh brother bham in the same court this Manan Church age uh he says he may commit you to death as he did Paul which he did to you for just a few moments and he says he may commit you to suffering as he did job which actually happened to you I think in talking to you I realized that you lost all the things you were doing you lost your job you lost your businesses and everything he says that he it is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose yes if he did not have a purpose that then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled it took you two two years to get to get well uh I was in the hospital for nine months and uh I would say it took uh another five years another five years to uh become functional so you can lay in the corner and feel sorry for yourself it's nothing's going to happen you know pet Peter and John they said uh silver and God will be none but in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk brother BR said nothing happened nothing happened so they grabbed him by the arm and as they were lifting him then the strength came back amen yeah yeah so there's something for us to do yeah not only to believe it but to act as we believe it so God has a purpose throughout those five years five six seven years about seven years or so and the pain you went through the loss you went through the frustrations you went through uh did you ever figure out the big picture that God had yes when I was H room uh I said to the Lord I said Lord what do you want from me in this condition because remember I couldn't remember my wife and my children and but I I I I still remembered having a relationship with the Lord that's when you're born again it's in the sub conscience so I was praying I said Lord what do you want from me in this condition and the Lord said to me if you knew the big picture you would have volunteered for it amen and I thought Within Myself no no uh but now uh years down the track and seeing how it has encouraged other people uh even people listening to the testimony receive a healing while they're listening to the testimony yes I yeah okay okay yes Lord uh now I can see the big picture and for the body for your people if I have to yep I'll do it again you told me maybe you can tell us a few testimonies this that you told me about of the man I think from the US and you know and how God spoke to him if you could you could oh okay the Tes yes I received maybe a few others I received a phone call about five years ago from a gentleman in in America he's not a Believer he's a Christian of some sort but not a believer in the message and he asked me he saidis this the Gary Walker uh that has the testimony of being dead three times and I said yes it is and he said uh I just want to phone you and thank you for uh what happened and he gave me uh his testimony that his father had died and his brother had died of uh a drug over and he was so such in a bad way that he was suicidal and uh he went to sleep one night and in his dream he had a dream a spiritual dream in his dream uh his dad his father his brother and himself were on the boat the three of them on the boat and he knew in the dream that his dad and his brother were dead and his dad stood up on the boat walked to the son the man that I'm talking to on the phone grabbed him by the collar and and said you have to go online and watch Gary Walker's testimony so he woke up and he went straight to the computer and he found out Gary Walker three times year was still alive watched the testimony and at the end of the testimony uh that Spirit of uh suicide had left him and uh yes so we we just I just thank the Lord that uh the Lord was able to use me to uh bless other people amen now you can see the big picture yeah do you think were you in Ministry before the accident of course yes and after did you see a change uh in your approach to the word I could identify with suffering like never before I could identify with other people suffering and I I never understood because because before the accident I was very Steely I I owned several businesses uh I was a non-nonsense sort of a person black was black white was white I I was I was quite stealing you know uh but after the accident I think I'm a lot more pliable I understand other people's sufferings uh I think I think I'm a better person for I actually I know I'm a better person for having gone through what I went through yeah and that's just the that's the plan of God and I've seen that you know we were in carja uh we've been in carja two three days ago and we had about a 2,000 people or 2,500 people in one of those meetings and we were all tired the previous night we had almost slept spent on the road uh with Brother Gary brother Timothy and the two brothers that we went with from church and um very tired weary of course if I was tired to that magnitude I believe Brother Gary was more tired than I was and and so uh that following day um an idea came up you know to have a prayer line for the people orices and after that just go so I I was so impressed when you know of course myself and the other brother was like okay you have a prayer line you know it can take six hours which can take quite a number of hours uh but especially that you had a heart would understand you know what going I think I remember saying Max you know and you know no wonder many times Brother people to check the spe of their P which is not entirely especially if you have a good pastor like I've noticed that kind of character that I've SE also you know I got it I got it from you got okay you know having a heart for the people feeling for the people and I think also you canot minister to the people without having heart for them you have to love them you have to feel for them absolutely yeah or it's just a religious act you know you have to love that person you have to feel for them you have to enter into their suffering and then you can expect something brother you need to say more about this because there are many young people who are going into Ministry and they need to understand yeah so there's more there's more to Ministry than just uh trying to be a celebrity uh a minister should be a servant if you are trying to build a kingdom or build a name please go and try golf don't enter into the ministry until you can you're willing to spend yourself sacrifice yourself because uh for all you young brothers that want to go into the ministry it's all about the people it's not about building calling a name or a kingdom it's about serving God's people and if you don't have that attitude for goodness sake stay off the field please please well right there I think we just go for a a short break of about you know just take a sip of water again for e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e the l for [Music] e e e e e e e e e for well I'm told we're back um I'd like to welcome you once again to uh to uh the bench with uh uh Brother Gary Walker once again we're just concluding and making a few final touches uh on this wonderful test there quite a lot of things to talk about Brother Gary a lot of things to learn a lot of things to go through if we we we continue uh I think we cannot uh fit in within the program but um we have this book I don't know if someone wants this book where how where can they find it is there brother M brother Gary's microphone on is it on Amazon so uh if you just go on Amazon and you search three times dead but still alive that's how it looks and I promise that I would give out some I don't know if they're here yet uh I promise that I would give out a few books to uh some people who would ask outstanding questions that would be a blessing to others so I have a three books with me that I'll give out as a gift before we end this program so uh it's it's quite a good thing I think many of us don't like reading yeah but if we can teach ourselves to read we can really be blessed reading is very good and very important for us uh you know books like this uh I I always want to say it's a product of the message of the hour you know someone who has met God been impacted by God been impacted by the the ministry of Malachi 4 and you know has a testimony like this it's worth our time worth for us to go and read it uh so I think we ended it there brother Gary when you were talking about how the big picture and how this impacted your life going forward in the ministry afterwards right yes uh it it helped me just to understand uh the sufferings of others it helped me to understand that uh uh because at that stage of my life really everything I enjoyed the challenge I was the type of guy that uh I just I would take the ball by the horns you know uh but then I found myself in a place where I was completely helpless and I had to depend on the help of others and I hadn't been there before so I I can uh I can understand how people feel bit Yeah so if you are going through something in your life as an individual that sometimes you feel or you think that um God has forgotten you sometimes it is because God is trying to mold your character for you to be um to have a life that impacts others in a better way and I just gave you that testimony in carja I could I could tell uh that uh I was I had gone there with Christians uh you know having a heart for the people and you know the desire to serve and minister to the people of God knowing that and I think this is something also you have to talk about Brother Gary because I know it is scriptural knowing that a pastor or minister of the Gospel is not the the law is not like Lord over the people but he is a servant and can you talk a little bit about servant leadership as far as the message is concerned okay so God God gave us uh fivefold Ministry God gave us uh helps God gave us uh those things for the benefit of the body uh so the body could edify itself so really the fivefold ministry should be trying to put themselves out of a job by getting the people to a place where they can understand who and what they are because really if you if you understand or you know who you are then it doesn't matter what people say that you're not uh you don't need accolades you don't need slaps on the back you don't need anybody holding your hand you're able to stand by yourself and that's what the ministry's job is for is to uh is to get the people to a place where they understand who and what they are in Christ so uh I always say a preacher is not a celebrity a preacher is a servant uh outside of that you've got the wrong idea you know uh the preachers are for the people they they're for the people uh to serve the people to get the people to a position where they can stand by themselves and where we go to church but finally we don't need church so the preacher is for the people absolutely a preacher is a servant a not someone supposed to be served necessarily but someone supposed to serve and I think this is what uh many ministers lack and many young people going into the ministry they go into the ministry of the wrong attitude thinking they're going to be served instead of them serving Jesus is your example so anything uh you need as a Christian just look at Jesus So speaking about ministry here we have a servant King uh deity and service to die gold frankincense and Mir uh an attitude every preacher's attitude should be we are here to be spent for the people not for the people to serve us yeah now brother Gary would you uh be able to ascribe your ability to go through this trial success sucessfully because of this of the revelation of the message of the hour yes uh you can do anything successfully if you're born again uh all the answers are in the New Birth uh there's no Magic Carpet there's no magic wand it's all in the New Birth if you have Jesus you have it all yeah um let's let's talk about the enti message mhm uh how do you understand the enti message uh the the message was sent to us to identify who we are that the message is not about a prophet that we thank God for a prophet the message is not uh for us to idolize the message the message is a tool uh given to us to help us to identify who we are in Christ even a lot the Bible says behold I send unto you Elijah so it wasn't for us to lift brother brandham up on a pedestal uh it was for us to acknowledge that this is son of man this is the absolute this is the voice of God this is thus sayith the Lord uh and then to move on to the real purpose of the message and that is are in Christ so in other words the message is not about the messenger it's about the recipients of the messenger yes absolutely behold I send you Elijah yes praise the name of the Lord so so in other words um what would you have to say to the people the Brethren some of them also who then now get sentiments that we don't even need to quot we don't even need to quot brother bham we don't need to uh quot you know read it like public to the people okay I would say first uh love you we love you we appreciate you uh but uh brother Brandon was first fruits anything more ripe than first fruits is rotten uh you cannot go beyond the prophet you can come up to where he was that's I just love some of the phrases you make I I I hope I hope you heard that you say brother Bram was the first fruits in this hour and anything more ripe than the first fruit is rotten the truth by the way if you look at it even in the in the real life life you know uh perspective you know so uh I I don't know I think there's more you can say to that okay so uh brother bam said I'm going to hit the high spots and I want you to go home and dig down deep so there's only so much that you can explain uh about logos or the thought of God with words so brother Benham did his best to describe something with words in this Dimension uh but there is a higher reality than words all we can do with words is paint fragmented pictures so if you take the message of the hour take what the prophet said and dig down deep then you'll catch the thought behind it so you're not adding to you're not taking away you're just entering into that Supernatural element because brother bam said something can be revealed to you but still the supernatural element is missing so you can listen listen to the tapes and they do no good unless you get into the spirit of Revelation dig down deep and then you'll catch the logos or the thought behind it which can't be explained with words so we're not adding to we're not taking away we're just getting into the place of what the prophet was trying to paint with words because then you have you're going to have two extremes some saying well you have only to read or listen to what he said no preaching and then you'll have others say well you you you know it's um it's only the preacher you don't need to uh quot anything you don't need to refer to brother bham and things like that I think the problem is still the same they need to get into the spirit of the of the message AB absolutely uh or else they're just forming another religion and it's like a dog going back to its vomit the very thing that that God sent a prophet for was to drag us out of organized religion uh to pull us out of being churchy and to get to a place where we understand who and what we are that's the big picture and uh brother bam said if you want to miss the rap if you want if you want to miss the tribulation period you better dig deep yeah and the prophet said God will never use a coward so we're not adding to we're not taking away we're just catching that Spirit of Revelation that we can Now understand spiritually what cannot be said with words you know I I I when when you start speaking I I'm I'm I'm just beginning to listen in and then you stop I think I think you you are also feeling the same way right yeah yeah you should you should continue because this is sweet I mean you know the revelation of the word is sweet friends especially when someone is speaking not his ideas but speaking the message because it's not this message is not about us about people about um rather ministers it's about the people that have been called to know who they are this is what this is all about this is why we even having this bench so that this is why we have church so that we can come and get to know who we are because when you know who you are then you cannot be defeated by Satan no matter what you know when you go through a lot of things in your life but the devil cannot defeat you because you realize you you've come to the realization of who you are I think this is what this this message is all about um even when you go through tough times like I cannot help to think that I would not want to go through what you went through um uh because I don't know whether I have the strength in me to sail through but if God would be able to take one brother one man through it so that he can come back afterwards and see and say to us look I see the big picture if I'm able to go I I I see the big picture I went through it because of this we too are going through our own it may not be an accident it might be it might not be loss of this lot loss of that but we we are also going through our own our own hardships our own trials and um uh I I trust that we can borrow a Lea from this and say well we have to face it we have to face it you said a statement and he said it's not always going to be easy no no uh it cannot be God God will make sure that it's not uh because if you just go through Easy Street you're not going to have the character for a Rapture so the crown that we wear is weighty uh and it's too weighty for a light head for a weak head you have to have the character to wear that crown of course that's a metaphor for a new body you know but if you're going to if you're going to be in Rapture you're going to have to have the character of Jesus Christ and the only way to do that is suffering if there was a better way God would use it and then we would complain about that yeah if there was a better way God would use it but that's the only way that's the only way and it is in the message brother Bas actually he is saying what brother Bama said these are not new things but it what makes it new for us is that he has experienced it he can speak what he has experienced by the way before you experience something you can never preach it I realize that many many sermons that I preach that really get to impact people is something I've gone through overcome it or experienced it and God has given me the grace to overcome it and then I can come and preach it by experience with the experience and then the spirit takes after that and then impacts the people and that's why I thought is very important for us to hear this testimony how many are being blessed by this testimony praise the name of the Lord so I I I don't know before we get into the other things Brother Gary whatever is left over or that we've not talked about about this accident and um you know and in connection to your life and Ministry that you think that the people would need to hear I think uh very uh important thing for the young people to hear for those that are watching online or archives uh is the question of sin because uh we need to we need to finally come to a conclusion and settle the sin question because too often the devil gets the advantage over you and you'll always think you're not good enough to be used by God uh somebody asked brother bam a question can a Christian sin and the prophet said absolutely no he said there's no scripture for that it's completely impossible for a Son of God to sin yeah so so then we say well what what what about all the stuff that you know the what we would classify as Sin is not really sin it's just obstacles to overcome to prove your appreciation for god making you sinless if you if you don't see it like that you'll always be condemned and you'll always think you're not good enough uh to enter into the field that God has called you to so you need to settle the sin question in your your heart God knows exactly God knows exactly that you you hate that thing that you love remember if it's a legitimate Temptation you've got to want it and it's got to be available everybody that's honest uh knows that there is the lust of the eye the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and uh before you were born again uh there was no fight you just did what you wanted to do because it was your life and you just did it but when you receive the Holy Ghost that's when the fight starts and that's when when you start feeling like a walking Civil War because there's two dogs on the inside a white one and a black one brother brand said I found two William Brams in here now one wants the things of the word and the other wants the things of the world so that old nature didn't go anywhere it's just standing very very close to you and it wants the things that you know now you shouldn't have so God knows that you hate the things you love like Paul said in Romans seven he said the things that I should do I don't do and the things that I shouldn't do well oh riched man that I am so God God God knows that there's a war on the inside but don't let that get the better of you because if you do you'll be useless in the kingdom of God you need to be functional and to be functional you need to settle the sin question that there is no sin there's just obstacles to overcome amen amen Ah that's a very powerful utterance uh is for something to be a legitimate temptation it has to be say can you say that again you got to want it and got it be available okay now I speak it in in Uganda and English okay for something to be a legitimate uh Temptation you have to want it and it has to be available like Jesus with the with the bread Satan said if that be the Son of God turn the this this rock into yeah into bread yeah brother B said Satan made that rock smell like freshly baked bread straight out of the oven after a 40-day fast it was there he wanted it yeah it was available yeah but he said it's written yeah yeah so for it to be a legitimate Temptation you've got to want it yeah it's got to be available but the new birth empowers us to overcome it so just because you wanted doesn't mean you're not a son of God yeah so you love it you love the things you H but the new birth gives you power to overcome that's why it is important for each of us by the way to be born again truly Born Again must yeah it's a must it's not a may be it's a must and when you when you meet a man a woman that is born again you don't need to ask them whether they are because you will see it by the life it's just like what you're preaching to us today that's what faith is as well you know because you you get to see that the the life of the man itself will speak it's not uh so much of of the words but it's so much of the life because they're truly born again and I have a few questions for you here brother Gary and if there's anybody here who has also questions I think um uh as your pastor would approve of you to ask because uh I I've found Brother Gary to be someone who is deep in the word and he loves this message of the hour and I think it is a good thing for you to ask uh so that uh he can share with us his experiences and it would be a blessing to our generation is that amen all right so I have a few a few for you here but before I do I I feel also inclin to ask you a little more about um what would you say to the critics of this message that would say brother bham is not the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and some have even believed him to be the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 for quite a few years and then they back away what would you say to that kind of thing nothing I was I would say nothing I'd mind my own business uh you have to have people like that you have to have the critics uh before you can hang in the Hall of Fame you first have to be crucified to the wall of critics so you need those people you need those people in your life we don't like it but you need it for your own character so before you can hang in the Hall of Fame you have to first be criticized yeah so in Australia you also have Believers of this message yes and you are one of them them yes amen and you're a pastor in this message yes sir so we are not alone the Believers are all over the world doesn't it bring a smile to your face I mean to me it always encourages me by the way I mean let's come to think of it that brother bham never went to every one of these countries but in every one of these countries all over the Earth there are witnesses witnesses that this message is true witnesses that Jesus Christ is alive witnesses that is that God changes that is the same yesterday today and forever that is a living God so we here interviewing a witness praise the Lord and so I have three questions from someone here as I wait for the others before we close he says what is the origin of the this is a a racial issue and he was wondering what's the origin of of the different I think we have I don't know how many races we have we have white we have black I don't really know whether it's black black cuz I'm not black but people call it black I think it's chocolate or or something like like that I'm pink you are pink you're not really white as well but people say white but anyways they say black and white and then I think there are also other resses so want what's the origin okay first thing I like to say is that if you're born again you're color blind you know you're we're all Brothers if we have a racial issue uh Adam was created an image of God and then God formed the body Out of the Dust and put that image of God into a body made of dust so if we got a racial issue is just a dust fight that's all it is yeah so uh I think if we're born again we're colorblind we're just brothers and sisters uh now the origin is ham sham and japeth they uh they were so I suggest to you to get myself out of trouble uh brother R said you are the color or you are what you are because of the the chemicals that are on the ground we the food grows so if we were to uh wrap a fence around Africa and no one could come and no one could go we would all end up black because of the soil if we were to go to uh Eastern Europe or if we were to go to Europe put a fence up that you can't come you can't go we would all look like Eskimos we would all look like European if we were to go to America wrap a fence around America then no one could come or no one could go we would all eventually end up looking like American Indians so it's the it's because of the location that that you live in now in the 20th century we we travel and we we uh inter marry and uh it doesn't work like that anymore we've hybrid the human race but uh the origin was hamam and japeth one went to a place called Africa one went to a place called uh Eastern a Asia and the other one went to Europe and even the Jews that went from because a Jew is a dark darker skinned person the ones that went to Europe after the second world war ended up White and the ones that came to Africa ended up black so it's just to prove not that we need proof but that's what the prophet said so as far as race is concerned it's just location location location yeah praise the Lord and then there's another question which says where where is the resurrected body of Jesus right now okay uh so I suggest to you brother randam said look brother R said returned back to being the pillar of fire so we we need metaphors we need words we need simuls to paint a mental picture so brother brandom said the body of Jesus Christ lays on an altar as a memorial that sin has been paid for so before you get too excited about that it's a metaphor and because in another place brother bam said it went back to being the pillar of fire in fact many places brother B said he went back to being the pillar of fire it's just that he knows now what it was to be a man so metaphorically he knows he's laying on the Altar interceding for us so the body of Jesus Christ one day you you are going to shake hands with Jesus because the Tabernacle of God will be with men but where is the body now honestly uh when there is a higher reality than this one there's a higher Dimension than this and you can't get your understanding even close to that other dimension so before we form clicks and groups and have church splits over where the body is it really doesn't matter as long as you're born again be born again it's it's not an issue unless you want it to be so if you think it's on an altar well okay it's on an altar if you think went back to being the P fire went back to being the P fire but let's let's forg good the sake let's not let's not fight about it yeah personally myself he went back to being the purifier because he said he said to Saul on the road to Damascus I am Jesus of Nazareth whom they are persecuted yeah thank you now number three when people die the body goes to the Grave where does the soul and the spirit go oh are they having a different destination and how I don't know these are several questions uh but I think you I hope you remember all of them so are they having different destinations and how will they gather together at the general Resurrection for the white Throne judgment will they go back to the real bodies from once they came okay uh no they won't go back to the real bodies because we have another body waiting for us I want to hand this body in slap one out and when I go to Rapture I don't want to see the thing again yeah I've got a new one waiting for me brother Bron went beyond the K of time and he saw people that were real that were tangible he put their hands around them uh your body and your soul uh without getting too uh philosophical about it because we have a proclivity to complicate things your body your soul and your spirit is the same thing uh the tent in the wilderness there was an outer tent then there was an inner tent and that one inner tent was divided into two so your spirit and your soul is is the same thing without getting too philosophical uh it goes to the same place M okay brother B said when Jesus died his body went to the Grave his soul went to God and His Spirit went to hell don't cause a church issue over that it makes perfect sense when you have a revelation of it uh if you don't have a revelation of it leave it alone put it on the shelf and God will show you yeah yeah because it has to be easy yeah it has to be simple it spiritual Revelation is like the transfer of spiritual common sense when God actually shows you you're like Oh I thought I already knew that you know brother BR says you have you will think oh I think I already knew that that's because you did because you know all things so if you're complicated and you can't put all the jigs or puzzles together leave it alone yeah you're going to cause a mess yeah yeah well uh I I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm going to close in a bit so if you have your question you'll come and take the microphone just come and stand there take the microphone ask your question um yes brother would you come yeah you can come up here feel free take the microphone and and ask you question yes God bless you God bless you my name is Moses m well I have a question but personally I got over it it's uh it's it's kind of a complex for the young ministers sometimes you go through a lot of things and personally the quote I had was that if you're a preacher and you come to the pulpit with a certain spirit it's the same Spirit you cast onto the people so there's a tendency of you looking at yourself and where you've been and you feel you're not worthy to preach like I I would like to ask you have you ever had such a time in your life when you felt so and how would you advise someone to overcome that thank you okay break that break that question down for me brother sorry okay um the question is what whatever preacher is he casts on to the people somehow the spirit that the preacher has okay okay like it will be projected to the people yeah so I think the first first of all can I stop there that shouldn't happen yeah if he's going to cast anything on the people it should be the word yeah yeah brother bam says sometimes we we pick up uh each other's spirit and that's not what we want we want the spirit of Jesus Christ we we want we want the word yeah and so what was the other question aha aha oh yeah yeah yeah okay so uh complexes are every every young Minister has one to a thousand complexes it's it's normal yeah uh and the only way to overcome a complex is to do the opposite in uh Clinical Psychology it's called Uh voluntarily facing your own fears uh if if you have repented of your sins you have a Christian has no history a Christian only has a future a sinner has history a sinner has no future okay uh outside of specific things that brother brandham says like a pastor must marry a virgin okay so those things are specific the things that mentions specifically it's our privilege to be obedient to outside of that don't complicate it uh it just know that a Christian only has a future uh and to overcome a complex is you're going to have to do the opposite yeah so uh uh you can be preaching against something that you know you're struggling with well I don't care all I want is the word it's the word I could be sucking on a cigarette right now and saying don't smoke what are you going to believe the word the word says don't smoke so if you're going through an issue at the moment still preach the word because the word is the word don't compromise the word because of your complex I'm I'm being a gentleman right I'm not I'm saying if you have a complex about something in your past don't let that uh affect your future you never you'll never successfully move into your future trying to drag your past behind you uh uh the word is the word just preach the word Don't Preach your complex just preach the word yeah a Christian has no past but a Christian has only the future AA has no future he only has the history H those are powerful words amen and thank you brother Gary for answering that question and also did did it did it satisfy you brother okay and thank you brother MOSI for us asking that uh I think you get yourself a book brother M yeah so brother Josh I expected you by now to have brought those books so that brother M can get his copy right away I don't know how many I have so I think I'm remaining with two okay what advice do you have for someone struggling with faith uh uh and then the other question the other follow up question on that is how can I reconcile faith and reason and how do you you handle doubts and questions about faith okay uh if you are born again remember you must be born again if you're born again you automatically have faith doubt is always in the background because it has to be there to challenge Faith uh as I say uh uh Faith uh and uh confusion uh or trust and confusion have a symbiotic relation relationship you can only trust God when you are perfectly confused if you are confused it doesn't make you not a Christian it just means you don't understand you can only really have trust when you just don't know what to do it just does it doesn't mean that you're not a Christian and if you doubt it just means that old nature is having a voice just because it has something to say doesn't mean it needs an audience it it's our responsibility to silence the negative voices in our own heads uh doubt will always be there until the Rapture uh just because you doubt doesn't mean that you're not a Christian it just means you're in a battle it's it's a fight to The Bitter End and you make mistakes every day brother BR said you make mistakes every day until the Rapture you'll make mistakes just get used to it they're just obstacles to overcome yeah um I have another question here uh what would you say about a man who longs to hear God Speak speak directly to them let me say away from the church services I mean speaking through dreams and the many different ways God speaks and this condition is really lasting and this life is accompanied with prayer uh that is a that is something that every honest Christian wants yeah uh but what if you're the person that brother Braham says God will only use once in life and that's it what if what if what if that you uh every honest Christian wants a closer relationship with God in fact there would be a problem with your experience if you didn't want a closer relationship with God but don't let that drive you insane you've got to be comfortable in your own skin remember you must be born again I'm talking to people that are born again if you're born again you've got to be comfortable in your own skin and realize that God's going to use you the way that he designed you to be used uh not every vessel in the King's house is the same so maybe there's one brother that God is using all the time and he has all the gifts and he's got all the Supernatural and he's Dreaming Dreams every night and then you got this poor brother over here it seems like a piece of Driftwood uh and God only uses them once in his whole life well God designed them like that your job is not to beat yourself up over uh uh over thinking that you're lacking if you have a burning desire for more of God that's all you need because brother bam said God is not going to judge you by what you do God is going to judge you by what you want what you desire God will only judge you by your desire and everybody everybody everybody that's born again has a desire for more of God so uh I I know some brothers are more gifted than others and if you are a little bit jealous of that he you got an issue do you need to deal with you need to be comfortable in your own skin just make sure you're born again that's what just be born again because if you have Jesus you've got it all amen amen how do you you know you have the Holy Spirit Ah that's a beautiful question that is always asked especially at a youth camp yeah yeah okay so sometimes some people tick all the boxes and five years they turn their back on the message it's Case by case it's a very personal thing but we can uh a basic checklist one you believe the message of the hour is a very good indication you believe the message of the hour two you have the fruits of the spirit because if you have the spirit you have the fruits of the spirit and three is you have a burning desire to see Souls saved those are the three things because the man when a mark those that sigh and cry for the Abomination done in the city so you should have a desire uh you should not be happy that people are going to go to hell yeah knowing that people are going to go to hell but you have a desire that everybody be saved two you have the fruits of the spirit three you believe the message of the hour now if you got all those those three boxes ticked it's a good indication that you have what you say you've got that's a perfect answer as a pastor can say that is 100% perfect God bless you do I get a book I think you'll get a book well then I have another one here that says how do you get the Holy Spirit uh that is a good question listen uh friends God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to receive it that's what the prophet said so the quick answer is it's easy you got to make yourself available now a lot of people have the Holy Ghost and don't know they have that's what the prophet said a lot of people think they have the Holy Ghost and and they don't they don't so how do I know what's my life producing uh Eve had the right womb but she received the wrong seed and she brought forth a hybrid human hagga had the wrong womb received the right seed brought forth a wild man Sarah had the right womb she received the right seed but she had a bad attitude and she brought forth a natural man but Mary had the right womb the right seed the right attitude and she brought forth the word if if you're bride and you have the right attitude God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want now Eve had a sensation hagga had a sensation Sarah had a sensation ation but Mary had no sensation when Jesus rose from the dead it was a silent Resurrection so if you haven't had a sensation it's got nothing to do with it it's what is your life producing don't forget God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more then you want to receive it so all you have to do is make yourself available have the right attitude and I tell you there's that's the winning formula and then don't go questioning yourself or judging Yourself by what you do right or what you do wrong because these things don't Define you what defines you is the word so you're going to make mistakes and if you if you have a sensation well I'm not impressed it it's just nice it's what does your life produce yeah so had you received the Holy Ghost my goodness you just got to ask for it you just got to want it yeah yeah yeah yeah you have to ask if you need God to fill you with the Holy Spirit you have to ask the Bible says ask and ye shall receive shall receive I think that's that's really the better way of answering that God bless you brother Gary and whoever asked that question you didn't put your name so no book for you if you had put your name then I would give have given you a book and so it says God bless you are there any specific scriptures or themes or principles that you emphasize in your ministry you didn't also put your names I don't know who you are uh well we don't want to we don't want to stop on a certain point you know the name of a denomination tells you where they stop believing uh the name of a camp in the message tells you where they stop believing yes so we want to believe the whole message uh if there's anything that I would emphasize is our position in Christ amen who we are because when she knows what it is that's when the ruption will take place so we we want to be careful to preach the whole word we want to be careful even to uh preach Divine Healing we want to uh when I was a child I did child things but then I grew up to be a man but if I drop something and I say if I drop a ball and it rolls under the table I get on my hands and knees like a little child and I go and get it yeah you know so there there's there's times where we preach the simple things there's times where we preach the Deep things but if there was an emphasis it would be who we are yeah but be very careful to preach the whole context of the message or else you end up with a click or a club and as soon as it happens uh it no longer becomes movement it becomes a monument and if it stagnates it's dead and that's the problem by the way that um every every Revival has had when people you know come in and they Camp they camp camping meaning the no more Revelations no no more God no more move movement of the spirit what we have received is what we have received no more and then by the BAM says when they denominate they die when they organize they die so uh in the message we we do not have any zeroing on on this on this idea that idea we eat the whole book so thank you so much for that Brother Gary and then this question says in case you come to church you hear your heart discerned from a to zed you call it Zed or Z either way uhhuh and and this happens from time to time and it's you perfectly how do you react to this in order not to miss it I don't understand the question I'm sorry so you come to church and you you hear your heart being discerned I would presume by the preaching of the word right and this happens from time to time but you kind of maybe she kind of feels she's missing it so what do you have to do say how do you react to this in order not to miss ah okay you need to come to church on a right frame of mind brother BR said you can't go home the same so you're either going to go home better or you're going to go home worse the devil heard that and said excellent I'll make sure they're in the bad frame of mind and if I can get them in a bad mood or bad frame of mind the devil said I will make sure they get to church because when they get to church with the right with the wrong frame of mind I know they're going to go home l a Christian so if you want to come to church and hear uh your life open up if you want to stand transparent before the Lord by the preaching of the word you just have to come to church in the right frame of mind you you have to come expecting to hear a personal message from the preacher not just in uh interesting information but a personal message from the preacher and then you can go home better but make no mistake about it you're not going to go home the same you're either going to be better or you're going to be worse and the devil heard the worst part and that's why brother Ram said the devil has he has a subtle instrument called the church so if the devil can get you in a bad mood he'll make sure you come to church because he knows you going to go home less than what you came so if you if you really want to hear uh your life being discerned by the preacher or Not by the preacher by the spirit of God but by the preaching of the word then you have to come to church expecting that and the question is when you have come you have come in the right attitude you've had your name being called you've been designed by the word what do you do in order not to miss your visitation relax don't try to be something uh don't try to be more spiritual than God just relax and be yourself uh you're going to get along with God a whole lot better just relax don't try to be spiritual don't go buing the biggest Bible just be comfortable in your own skin uh you hear the Lord speak to you say thank you Jesus and just be normal just be normal amen and brother bam said it will take care of itself amen amen and you know uh talking about that being normal and being yourself I think this is better to be said also at this moment you find that you know the Holy Spirit can move in a service and someone can be touched in a real special way you find someone maybe jumping up and shouting you find another one just crying you find another one you know some some people can even roll on the floor I mean we've seen these things happen and it's okay but then you who also you've you had your name being called you've had yourself being designed and you feel like you are less spiritual because you're not reacting the way the other person is reacting I think you have something to say about that yes uh brother R said when the Same Spirit hits me I jump and I shout when the Same Spirit hits sister MAA she sits down and she thinks about it yeah we are not here to conform to each other yeah yeah I know people that have come from noisy loud and animated churches and they have relocated to a quiet church and they through a process of time become quiet so that was not spiritual that was Conformity yeah it proved it because if that if that was real in the quiet Church they'd be jumping and chatting yeah I've seen people go from a quiet church and they go to a noisy church and through a process of time they end up noisy jumping animated people and I'm not impressed and I don't think it's spiritual I just think it's Conformity this a good healthy church will be a mix of loud and quiet yes if we all quiet we're conforming if we're all noisy we're conforming but if you can just relax and be comfortable and be who God designed you to be just be the man that God designed you to be don't worry about what other people are doing just worship God the way God designed you to worship that'll be a healthy Church you'll have some people shouting you'll have some people sitting you'll have some people running you'll have some people standing it just be everybody will just be comfortable in their own skin I tell you and that's a church that is alive amen oh your amens would have been louder than that we just love that answer God bless you and also it also goes to Ministry you know every Ministry is different and every Ministry is special I've had people comparing you know Minister ministers you know saying oh this one is the best preacher or the other one is the best or uh or or this and when ministers here that sometimes it gets to them and maybe you find especially younger ministers they want to try and act the way another Minister preaches if he's a favorite of the many so you find that there competition there MH you know uh if I could say something on that please uh the bride is not stupid uh the bride is Discerning as I said this morning both Prophet priest and King some preachers are just dead boring because they weren't called and the bride knows uh some preachers are very very interesting and they can preach for two hours and it only seem like one hour uh and you know it's spiritual because you were affected uh some preachers are is dead boring and nothing happens and you can't wait the whole congregation just knows that please this is just a public speech this is just uh this is this is not spiritual this is not Church the bride is not stupid so just because a brother says he's a preacher it's the bride will know if he is or not I just because a man has something to say doesn't mean it deserves an audience we're talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ you've got to handle her carefully yeah you can't manhandle her and just because you think I'm the man of the a well she's going to know whether you are or not yeah so yeah thank you thank you how many are being blessed I have the last question unless I have more it says and uh ah sister I'm going to give you a book and I know you like reading where are you uhuh you're get you're getting a book how can you summarize the message of the hour it's a good question yeah can I summarize the message of the hour it is Jesus Christ in bright form amen God had a purpose and that was to bring forth a people liken unto himself God sent us a prophet so that God could bring forth the people likened unto himself and I think this is what you preached also this Sunday morning amen that was really lovely really lovely God bless you uh so the the summary of the message of the hour is Jesus Christ in bright form and you notice brother bam said never at time do I bring a message so that I can have a following or some organization or some church but that people should have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ amen so it is uh a people that are transformed into the image of Christ Jesus Christ in bright form that's the summary for you sister Rachel uh I have three more papers and and I think uh I'm about to close if you have any question you better bring it now else I would say no more questions because I want to close is it proper for me as a Believer to go and preach in any Pentecostal church when given a privilege to do so by themselves like when you are invited in their fellowship and what do you need to bear in mind before you go ah lovely question yes go and preach yes yes yes uh be a gentlemen uh don't compromise the word we can accommodate without compromise uh uh if you've been invited to go and preach go preach yeah yeah preach uh baptism in jesus' name don't go don't go throwing in the seven everything because they don't understand it anyway i' I'd introduce serpent seed or uh baptism in jesus' name or something you know whatever the Spirit uh uh guides you or leads you but if you've got an invitation to go preach at a Pentecostal Church run for it yeah especially if you're called to preach and and be a gentleman yes um that's a good one uh how do you get Faith be born again I think that answer is just enough and I think Whoever has asked this question can can I say something you go back to the morning service yes please are you probably if you're are born again and you feel like you don't have faith you probably have misunderstood yourself you're probably trying to reach out where you shouldn't be uh brother Bram said sir in the audience I see you're battling with cigarettes you've been trying to give up cigarettes he said that's because you're trying too hard faith is so close to you it's a part of you if you've been born again it's a part of your spirit uh it's like I don't have to go put a shirt on brother R said I'm already wearing a shirt so it's not is no is no should be no question how do I get Faith if you're born again you got it it's just now the hard part is simplifying it and what we say in Australia dumbing down to to to grab something because it's God hiding in Simplicity it's not faith is not intellectual faith is not something it's not an emotional leap into the dark faith is not an emotional leap into the dark faith is tangible it's it's part of you you you you have it if you if you just knew that it was so simple and so close you'd probably be more successful with it amen and um any more with any questions cuz after this no more questions I think uh these young people are impressed with the way you answering those questions because these are the most questions we have ever answered on an interview so it says how do you interpret scripture and what roles does it play in shaping our faith okay uh we have no right to interpret scripture uh we we have the message which gives us a template do you know what a template is a template yeah and then we can take that template and we can put that over other scriptures like brother R said a tree represents a man uh green is a new beginning blue is the color of Fellowship uh he gives us he gives us a lot of details uh on what things are which we can transfer to another place as long as we remember that context is King so we're not interpreting scripture brother Bram has already done that uh all we're doing is we are taking the template of what the prophet said and applying it to uh places where brother bam never spoke of uh uh and as far as interpreting the word it's been interpreted yeah yeah so we are interpreting nothing we are only taking the template and applying it on situations yes so so that we can so that we can so that we can uh get to the place where we have it in our spirit that can't be explained with words I tell you that this message and I've been speaking to preachers around the world this message has got to a place where you cannot a preacher cannot fully paint that picture in the minds of the people like he used to because the word is so rich we really don't have those words so that's why the if the congregation comes to church and a right frame of mind you you you can hear in the silence you you you can you can uh you can go where words can't take you amen yeah amen how do you be delivered when the devil has a claim on you what how do you get delivered if the devil has a claim on you okay so if you don't have the faith to do it yourself see your pastor and get him to pray for you amen cuz we cast out Devils amen amen and if you are here and you as you as that question you might as well come here uh while we are finishing we will cast out those demons which are bothering you can you be filled with the Holy Ghost and you are still still struggling with weakness is like prayerlessness yes yes full of the Holy Ghost and struggling with personal desire full of the Holy Ghost Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am full of the Holy Ghost and still doing the wrong thing yes yes yes yes yeah but it should get better as you mature in the Lord those things should start dropping off and I think that brings us to the last question the last last last one the last last last last one so how do you uh uh connect or reconcile the baptism of the Holy Ghost and adoption I think it would be a good thing if you can be able to uh paint a little picture for the people to understand uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the gift the gift adoption is the giver uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost so if I give brother Buzz a gift of mine he hasn't got me but if I become brother Buzz that's adoption so if I have the Holy Ghost I'm now I'm now a new creature I've been birthed I'm here you can't get rid of me I'm here here's the baby but the baby grows it can't stay in Pediatrics there's something in the body that will just continue to grow it continues to grow until finally God can see that he can trust you with anything he can throw at you and when God can trust you with that the adoption is because you see a baby is elective but adoption is chosen you you choose who you adopt so when the father can see you're at a position where you can run the family business yourself he says hey don't talk to me no more he you him so your the Born Again experience and the adoption brother B said is two different things two different things so when you are born again you have entered into a spiritual life the real you is now on the scene but in in a baby form and now it's a matter of growing in the Holy Ghost where those things that used to trouble you don't trouble you anymore and you're getting that those things are just dropping away and then when finally the father can see that he can trust you with anything he can throw at you it's here ye him that that's the adoption and you an adopted child still coping with personal issues but God can see that he can trust you with it and you're not you're not going to use that as an excuse use you're going to overcome it amen to those of you who have been listening to the ministry of Brother Gary Walker this weekend I would advise you to go listen to these messages the adoption baptism of the Holy Spirit brother bham preached that I think two two messages in that uh it is the rising of the sun these are titles I'm throwing out to you go and listen to them um the seed shall not be here with a shark Christ the mystery Christ is the mystery of God revealed go listen to these messages and you will not remain the same how many have been blessed by the minister Brother Gary this weekend let us give the Lord a clap of Praise hallelujah hallelujah well uh we've reached the end of our interview Brother Gary and if the Lord Tes we want you to come again God bless you and uh that when when you come again we will not only have a church program we want to make something that will bless everyone in the city because your ministry should be hard not because of anything but because you stand with this message the way brother bham presented it praise Lord and uh would you please pray over the people and after saying your last remarks okay so if I could do the benediction uh uh so been a privilege for me to be here uh and uh watching you and seeing what you're doing uh in Uganda and even in other countries uh is an inspiration to me and I think the people need to appreciate you and thank God for you uh I do and uh I'll be inviting you to Australia amen and um I I just thank God for men uh like yourself that have a burden to see Soul saved amen amen amen so God bless your heart thank you brother Gary those are big swelling words but I really appreciate God for you and thank you for accepting our invitation to come and be a blessing I mean someone flying all those hours just to come and be a blessing to us we appreciate really appreciate him and I'm going to leave this chair before Brother Gary can play Pray sorry and I'll have brother Tim come say a few remarks just to show that he was also in Uganda he's a minister in brother Gary's church and uh and and he ministers under him so I'll leave this chair have you brother Timothy come say a few words to the people people who are here and also those who are online thank you brother Buzz uh privilege to be here privilege to be amongst the uh the people of God who have uh been numbered in this late hour it's the uh Pinnacle time to be alive it's the hardest season to be in but it's the most wonderful to see and to be in and it's just a privilege to come with Brother Gary and to meet the people of this place and I have said it a few times but I say it because I mean it I believe you are a very rich people rich in character rich in in uh I would say rich in uh spiritual wealth as well and I mean that and it's a it's a it's an honor to to be supporting anything that is serving God in his body at this time I think we are well taught and we know that the only way we can tangibly serve our wonderful gracious heavenly father is to serve his wife which is present on this Earth at this time we all have our ups we all have our downs but in our heart of hearts in our soul of souls we identify with the word of Truth and it is life to us and we don't just believe it but we love it and as Pastor Gary has said many times uh you are you're not going to go to Heaven by believing this message you're going to go to glory and be in the Rapture by being this message amen so I'm thankful to be numbered with Brothers like Pastor Gary Pastor buzz and all the Brethren out there amen just being a pastor doesn't put you on a Pinal it doesn't elate you I'm I'm a firm believer if we all take our position then the whole system works well y like a clock with many different parts it is effective and functional when everybody uh understands their position which I will confess is something that evolves over time and is happy to support the body in that manner amen because I I'm I'm a believer that uh that if we could really see into the Unseen knowing that the Unseen FM is more real than the scene then Brother Gary said the Lord said to him you would volunteer for this and uh we have a privilege to have breath in our bodies and pulsation in our hearts Amen to serve the body knowing as it's been said recently that very soon we we believe the raptures very soon or we believe the going of the Bride which is the rapture is very soon culminates or closes in our opportunity to serve him in the richness of worship that we have in the season that we are living amen so thank you for the opportunity to be here to support Brother Gary amen I believe he's a true man of God I don't lift him up but I believe God has given him the Grace to go through the things that he has gone through for the benefit of the body of Christ not just locally but worldwide I've had the privilege to sit under his ministry for many years now amen and we don't lift up a man but I do believe we should acknowledge what God has got in place and the prophet of God said that the ministry the Pastor the ministers the ministry demands respect amen and as we put these little things in place and we we we fall into the the picture as Jesus wants us to fall into the picture then everything works everything works so I don't know why I said all that but just to say that it's a privilege to be part of this little opportunity knowing that God puts us through things and as the pastor has preached uh very firmly at times he said remember God will put you through things for the benefit of someone else which I think is a very amazing thing to think of in our lives because sometimes things don't kind of work out in a way that we kind of plan and maybe we kind of think maybe we should chew to our Lord a little bit in a couple of areas but knowing that God puts us through things that somehow the body is going to need at some time and so I I thank the Lord to be part of the uh the ministry in this end time amen knowing that it is most definite that before we open our mouth to preach a message we need to live a message amen because then it will carry weight and the life that you carry can transfer because it has a reality behind it so in saying all that uh I'll just give over to Pastor Gary now but I'll just say it's a lot more thing God bless you all it's a privilege to be serving the lord and the body in this hour at whatever time and in whatever capacity and brother Gary is guilty of saying many times I've encouraged him to rest at certain times and brother Gary is just determined to serve the body he said I will rest in the Millennium so it just it's uh I think there's time for rest too I I think that's healthy but his determination is to God has given him what he's given him and it's for the benefit of the body of Christ and I I believe as brother said before anyone needs to uh before he can say that it's witnessed in his life and and in your lives too amen and may we be a blessing to each other and encourage each other right up until the final moment amen so I'll give over to Pastor God bless you God bless you don't don't don't don't uh forget that not everything that you go through is for you like Tim said eh Somebody's Watching You someone's watching to see what your reaction to an action is and it might be uh that God is using you as a as an advertisement to what Christianity is so not everything that you go through is for you don't feel sorry for yourself everything works together for the good amen amen so love each other and pray for one another don't forget uh your relationship with God is indicative of your relationship with each other so love one another genuinely love one another appreciate one another pray for one another say nice things about one another uh brother bam said and then God will bless you yeah so we we're not in it uh we're not in it uh for anything else but for the glory of God yeah so let let's just bear our heads gracious father Lord you have done all things well Lord and you are all together lovely father we we thank you for the message of the hour we thank you for the baptism of the Holy Ghost we thank you for Spiritual Revelation that takes us to a place Lord where finally you can trust us with the trials that you give us and we come to that place of adoption which is the most important thing for the hour for the day that we're living in so Lord I I I pray that we don't complain about circumstance I pray Lord that we just learn to worship and the trial we we we pray the praise and the pain Lord and that we would be the people that you you have designed us to be we thank you for every opportunity that you give us Lord Jesus we thank you Father that you are our God you are our husband you are our friend and Lord what a remarkable thing to think that your Prophet called you our brother it's amazing to us Lord Lord you are amazing to us I pray you bless this people bless brother Buzz Our God strengthen him for the journey that lays ahead and all that he does bless all the ministers the preachers the Deacons the trustees everybody oh God that has their shoulders to the whe for the furtherment of the Kingdom Lord and may we all be functional in your
