[1:31:38] God I just can't hesitate to thank my
[1:31:41] God for saving me from a nasty accident
[1:31:46] yesterday the motor bike on which I was
[1:31:48] I was run was run by and crashed and
[1:31:53] rolled under the failed
[1:32:05] trctor yeah and then roll
[1:32:08] under from up and the hilly from Up and
[1:32:12] Down The Hil slope
[1:32:14] and I really can't figure out how I
[1:32:18] escaped but it was just the unfailing
[1:32:20] hand of
[1:32:21] God that Lifted Me from the the
[1:32:25] cycle to the after side of the
[1:32:28] road you know the the hand of God lifted
[1:32:32] up from the
[1:32:34] motorcycle to the other side of
[1:32:37] the and then the motorcycle was run
[1:32:41] over Hallelujah it was a very
[1:32:43] frightening
[1:32:45] sight that I pray God to erase from my
[1:32:50] mind may his wonderful name be praised
[1:32:53] forever and
[1:32:56] that is
[1:32:58] Sister amen and to see her here this
[1:33:02] morning I believe it's the grace of

[1:33:10] amen praise the Lord the Lord our God is
[1:33:13] good and he knows how to take care of
[1:33:17] us amen
[1:33:20] yesterday uh my family and I was at past
[1:33:25] Pastor Steven
[1:33:28] and's
[1:33:36] anniversary his wife and his wife and
[1:33:40] himself of
[1:33:42] them they made 44 years in
[1:33:47] marriage
[1:33:49] amen I I I had to tell you that because
[1:33:52] we have many young couples here
[1:33:57] so you need to know that you still have
[1:33:59] a long way
[1:34:02] ahead and you should
[1:34:04] build don't give
[1:34:07] up so and uh uh I told him that thank
[1:34:13] you for inspiring Our
[1:34:17] Generation so we were there together
[1:34:19] with inspiring notm my brother find the
[1:34:23] the best
[1:34:31] words oh no not
[1:34:33] enticing
[1:34:41] INSP I I think it is
[1:34:46] encouraging yeah our
[1:34:48] generation those are the things that we
[1:34:50] should look
[1:34:52] at and desire
[1:34:55] we should not look at what we see on
[1:34:56] social
[1:34:59] Med those
[1:35:01] things we should not desire the SL
[1:35:03] Queens we see
[1:35:06] them we should not desire the you know
[1:35:09] those kind of uh couples that people are
[1:35:13] desing out
[1:35:16] there are married four five
[1:35:21] times someone is 50 years and is
[1:35:23] bringing a girl of 20
[1:35:27] saying and everybody is commenting
[1:35:30] oh and you are also
[1:35:34] commenting that's not our kind of role
[1:35:38] models we believe you you should get
[1:35:41] married and stay with your
[1:35:44] partner until death
[1:35:46] do and if death does not do you part
[1:35:50] then the Rapture
[1:35:51] will you will go together
[1:35:55] so it was a wonderful
[1:35:57] experience my wife and I
[1:36:04] were but Pastor Steven looked at us
[1:36:07] myself and my
[1:36:09] wife she looked at he looked at us and
[1:36:11] asked how many years
[1:36:14] now we said
[1:36:16] 11 he said so you have 3
[1:36:21] years I think 30 something so I
[1:36:24] so uh but I think my wife we are
[1:36:26] determined to make
[1:36:29] it amen amen amen we are time to
[1:36:32] go praise the Lord I think at this time
[1:36:36] we can stand and go to the
[1:36:38] word and while we are doing that maybe
[1:36:40] just to make a few remarks as well
[1:36:44] understanding on the church land
[1:36:47] fun we we have um some brethren that uh
[1:36:53] uh that pledged to give towards the
[1:36:59] generator and as well as I think the
[1:37:01] generator costed more than 2 million I
[1:37:03] don't
[1:37:06] remember and um 2.4 Brother Martin can I
[1:37:11] have the exact
[1:37:14] figure is
[1:37:17] okay okay what do you remember I'm I'm
[1:37:20] sorry I I I'm putting him on spot I did
[1:37:22] not ask him to prepare the the figure
[1:37:23] for us so uh also there the
[1:37:28] flow the initial amount of money we
[1:37:33] spent so about 2.4
[1:37:36] million so this amount we are taken from
[1:37:39] the land
[1:37:41] fund you noticed this this time Sunday
[1:37:47] the brother did not announce the overall
[1:37:51] amount because I I told him not
[1:37:55] to because I don't want our expectations
[1:37:59] to
[1:38:01] raise because last Sunday he announced
[1:38:04] we had 60
[1:38:06] million but this is not true because
[1:38:11] some of these things were not
[1:38:14] subtracted because it was
[1:38:16] pledged and not
[1:38:18] paid so and it was not subtracted from
[1:38:21] the overall
[1:38:24] and so uh I think we we should announce
[1:38:27] it we should announce the overall total
[1:38:29] after all those
[1:38:35] expenses kindly friends Whoever has made
[1:38:38] a
[1:38:39] pledge please uh make your pledge
[1:38:43] good because we we want to keep
[1:38:47] going is that
[1:38:50] understood amen may God bless you as you
[1:38:53] fulfilled the
[1:38:55] I think this week they will contact you
[1:38:58] individually you forgot so they can
[1:39:02] remind all right I think that's all the
[1:39:04] singing will do thank you
[1:39:07] musicians uh we are going to
[1:39:14] theonomy 28
[1:39:38] vers

[1:40:34] plenteous in Goods in the fruits of thy
[1:40:37] body and in the fruit of thy CLE and in
[1:40:40] the fruit of the ground in the land
[1:40:42] which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to
[1:40:45] give thee
[1:41:04] 12 the Lord shall open unto thee his
[1:41:08] good treasure the heaven to give the
[1:41:11] rain unto Thy Thy land in his season and
[1:41:15] to bless all the work of thine hand and
[1:41:18] thou shalt lend unto many nations and
[1:41:21] thou shalt not borrow
[1:41:42] I would like us um those of you with
[1:41:44] English Bibles to read it
[1:41:47] together and um so that you can say it
[1:41:50] on your mouth as
[1:41:51] well vers 12 1 2 3 start the Lord shall
[1:41:57] open unto thee his good treasure the
[1:42:00] heaven to give the rain unto thy land in
[1:42:04] his season and to bless all the work of
[1:42:07] thine hand and thou shalt lend unto many
[1:42:10] nations and thou shalt not borrow we
[1:42:13] believe that can we say
[1:42:16] amen amen you may be seated
[1:42:25] this is um something that U the Holy
[1:42:28] Spirit led me to share with you this
[1:42:32] morning brother Fred I'm happy to see
[1:42:34] you
[1:42:36] lost bless
[1:42:38] youcome amen and I'm sharing with you
[1:42:41] this
[1:42:42] morning on the
[1:42:45] subject of building
[1:42:49] something from nothing
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:55] I'd like to see the married people to
[1:42:56] raise up their
[1:42:58] hand if you're
[1:43:01] married okay you are all standing seated
[1:43:04] a little far but thank you thank
[1:43:06] you okay
[1:43:09] now uh and also there others who are
[1:43:12] soon getting
[1:43:14] married and by the way I I think like we
[1:43:18] prophesied in the beginning of the
[1:43:21] year and by by the way it's not us who
[1:43:24] make these
[1:43:26] things maybe someone may think that
[1:43:29] Pastor does much
[1:43:33] making he calls this one and tells him
[1:43:36] praise you
[1:43:38] ready and sister you are
[1:43:41] ready please get
[1:43:43] married this is spontaneously done by
[1:43:47] God we don't believe in in those kind of
[1:43:50] match making
[1:43:54] God is the greatest match
[1:43:58] maker and when the time is right he
[1:44:01] accomplishes the
[1:44:03] thing amen we are only there to support
[1:44:06] what God is
[1:44:08] doing and so like I said this
[1:44:11] year is plent of
[1:44:14] weddings so once the the one of sister p
[1:44:17] is
[1:44:19] done there are others that are
[1:44:21] coming from this church
[1:44:24] yes from
[1:44:25] this amen and not just
[1:44:29] one more than one so I'm praying that
[1:44:33] you don't get
[1:44:34] tired to support the young people
[1:44:38] especially those of you are older don't
[1:44:41] get tired we are building
[1:44:45] something building something from
[1:44:50] nothing I would like you to pray for me
[1:44:54] I've um I've been quite busy and little
[1:44:57] sleep so uh I'm not saying I'm sleepy
[1:45:00] right
[1:45:01] now what I'm saying is when that
[1:45:05] happens the body is tired so if you pray
[1:45:09] for me I'll get out of my body and the
[1:45:13] Holy Spirit will come and
[1:45:14] take that's my desire I always look at
[1:45:18] when I'm going to share something
[1:45:28] and then as soon as I connect with him
[1:45:31] it's like a it's like uh you connect
[1:45:33] your your phone to a
[1:45:36] charger from that moment it's no longer
[1:45:39] me talking I'm just connected to
[1:45:44] a and then you know it keeps on
[1:45:47] moving for as much for as long as your
[1:45:49] phone needs charging
[1:45:53] is isn't that what we need this morning
[1:45:56] so you should be praying for me in your
[1:45:57] heart now that the Lord will surely take
[1:46:00] me out of the way that he will use me
[1:46:03] this
[1:46:04] morning for all our
[1:46:06] benefit building something from
[1:46:11] nothing building something from
[1:46:14] nothing those words came to
[1:46:17] me and um I was wondering what is it
[1:46:21] about and then the Holy Spirit began
[1:46:23] speaking to
[1:46:24] me to show me how he does his
[1:46:28] work that God is God and God is by
[1:46:33] himself where did God come
[1:46:36] from God came
[1:46:38] from wherever he came
[1:46:41] from but no one made
[1:46:43] God if you go to the Book of
[1:46:46] Genesis chapter one The Bible does says
[1:46:50] something very significant
[1:46:53] he says in the beginning God created the
[1:46:55] Heaven and the
[1:46:58] Earth but it does not tell us what was
[1:47:02] there before this
[1:47:04] verse but I can tell you what was there
[1:47:07] he was he was God already he had by the
[1:47:11] time Genesis 1:1
[1:47:14] came God was God but our Prophet told us
[1:47:19] that there was a time God was not God
[1:47:24] are you following me you know there was
[1:47:26] a time he was the self-existent
[1:47:30] one existing with all his
[1:47:33] attributes and he had not created
[1:47:36] anything but God means object of
[1:47:42] worship so that
[1:47:44] means something that is
[1:47:46] worship that's why in one of the laws it
[1:47:49] says Thou shalt have no other gods
[1:47:51] beside me
[1:47:55] meaning you will not worship anything
[1:47:57] else apart from me so he needs worship
[1:48:02] and that's why we came to worship him
[1:48:03] this morning so we worship him we love
[1:48:06] him beyond anything
[1:48:09] else and so now there was a time he
[1:48:13] wasn't worshiped at
[1:48:14] all because there was nothing to worship
[1:48:17] him so when did he become God when he
[1:48:21] created angels
[1:48:23] and now Angels began to worship him
[1:48:25] saying holy holy unto the Lord and they
[1:48:29] worship him both day and night they are
[1:48:31] always in his
[1:48:33] presence every day of course there is no
[1:48:36] time there it's
[1:48:38] eternity so from eternity to
[1:48:42] Eternity they worship him and so by the
[1:48:45] time he created man or by the time even
[1:48:47] the beginning
[1:48:49] started as we know it he was
[1:48:53] God but how about if we go
[1:48:56] behind before he became
[1:48:59] God who was he he was Elohim he was the
[1:49:03] spirit that gives life and he exist ex
[1:49:06] existed with all his
[1:49:09] attributes but you see when he started
[1:49:13] building okay this is not not about him
[1:49:16] we are not talking about him today we
[1:49:18] are talking about his
[1:49:21] work so when he started now
[1:49:24] building he started building
[1:49:27] things are you following me he started
[1:49:31] building things but these things he was
[1:49:34] building he was not building them using
[1:49:38] any raw
[1:49:42] material I don't know whether you
[1:49:44] understand the magnitude of
[1:49:47] that when he was building he did not
[1:49:51] need any raw material to build
[1:49:55] his word was RA
[1:49:57] material you know when you are building
[1:50:00] a
[1:50:01] child you need a
[1:50:03] seed and you need the egg and a child
[1:50:07] comes out when you need a bottle you
[1:50:11] need to have some
[1:50:12] ingredients some raw materials that you
[1:50:15] will use to build the B when you need a
[1:50:19] house you will need Stone you will need
[1:50:22] sand you need cement you need many
[1:50:25] things the one who built this
[1:50:27] microphone he needed many things and
[1:50:30] then to put it together and then build
[1:50:33] it the one who built the
[1:50:36] phone he could not build it from
[1:50:39] nothing he build it from
[1:50:41] something but do you know that all the
[1:50:45] builders physically speaking have been
[1:50:48] building from what already is in
[1:50:50] existence
[1:50:54] so God is the only
[1:50:56] Creator who could create or and can
[1:50:59] create
[1:51:01] something from
[1:51:03] nothing and so everybody else is
[1:51:06] creating things making things out of
[1:51:11] something that God had already
[1:51:13] previously
[1:51:16] created so they're building out of God's
[1:51:20] creation
[1:51:22] but I'm speaking this morning amen about
[1:51:26] a people that are living on Earth today
[1:51:29] that can actually create and build
[1:51:33] something from literally
[1:51:35] nothing amen is that even
[1:51:39] possible it is possible amen because
[1:51:42] these people will have to be like God
[1:51:46] himself and will be able to create and
[1:51:49] build
[1:51:50] something from nothing
[1:51:54] amen we have an example in our
[1:51:56] generation his name is William
[1:51:59] Bram William Bram had an experience of
[1:52:04] building
[1:52:05] something from nothing amen praise the
[1:52:09] name of the Lord as he was out there in
[1:52:12] the forest and he was a
[1:52:15] hunter so he was hunting for the whole
[1:52:18] day and he used to like
[1:52:20] squirrels and he couldn't find any and
[1:52:23] so he hunted and hunted and he gave up
[1:52:27] but then you know the presence of God
[1:52:29] came and as he talked to him he said
[1:52:33] just how many do you
[1:52:36] want just speak it say it and it will
[1:52:42] happen he am I you
[1:52:45] know I want
[1:52:47] three where do you want
[1:52:50] them are you are you say something here
[1:52:54] this man was connected with
[1:52:57] God it was the oh my God it was the
[1:53:00] right
[1:53:01] season it was the right time it was the
[1:53:04] right person it was the program of God
[1:53:07] there's a lot of things I want you to
[1:53:10] see and then God told him when all these
[1:53:14] things that have
[1:53:15] spoken all the five musts as we shall
[1:53:18] see it
[1:53:19] here it must be his time
[1:53:23] I'm going ahead of myself but it's okay
[1:53:25] it must be his season it must be
[1:53:27] according to his
[1:53:28] word it must be the the person he has
[1:53:31] chosen to do it
[1:53:33] by and it must be God's
[1:53:37] program all those things are true
[1:53:40] true you are going to be connected to
[1:53:43] God to the extent you can actually
[1:53:45] literally hear
[1:53:48] from you will no longer speak like how
[1:53:50] people are
[1:53:51] saying that something spoke to me you
[1:53:55] will know God spoke to
[1:53:57] me and he told me to go and start a
[1:54:01] compy there is something where I'm going
[1:54:03] you see and so now here we see that God
[1:54:08] spoke to him and told him where do you
[1:54:12] want them God wasn't standing there with
[1:54:15] him but he was connected to him and he
[1:54:19] was hearing his voice and he was
[1:54:21] speaking back
[1:54:23] oh my mind and then he said where do you
[1:54:26] want them he said I want one
[1:54:29] here before he even said
[1:54:32] here it was already there the first
[1:54:36] squir said a squid he shot
[1:54:40] it it had
[1:54:43] blood it was a real
[1:54:45] squ it was a real living
[1:54:48] creature and this squid was never in
[1:54:52] mother's
[1:54:55] womb it was never born by any other
[1:54:59] squ it came from literally
[1:55:02] nothing something from
[1:55:05] nothing and again he said where another
[1:55:08] one where I want it
[1:55:11] here and there was a squir we are not
[1:55:15] talking about a
[1:55:18] fe it's not just a
[1:55:20] story this is not a fiction
[1:55:23] movie these things
[1:55:27] happen we know the day the time the
[1:55:31] year it is history it
[1:55:34] happened and he created another one
[1:55:36] there and another one there how many
[1:55:40] squirel three
[1:55:42] squirel he shot each of them with his
[1:55:45] gun and each of them uh you know was
[1:55:48] shedding blood to show you it was a real
[1:55:51] living
[1:55:53] and he cared them and went home to
[1:55:59] Mex and these
[1:56:01] squirel were living
[1:56:04] things and they were
[1:56:06] created out of literally
[1:56:09] nothing by someone who was in his right
[1:56:13] season to hear the voice of
[1:56:17] God hallelujah and at the same time I
[1:56:20] did not prepare this to read it for you
[1:56:24] I wish I had then he gave this testimony
[1:56:28] to
[1:56:29] Sister Sister
[1:56:31] right and sister right had this
[1:56:35] testimony how God created the
[1:56:38] squirrel from
[1:56:40] nothing and she said brother Bram that
[1:56:44] is nothing but the
[1:56:46] truth and the prophet said she said the
[1:56:50] right words
[1:56:53] and the moment she said those right
[1:56:55] words amen God came down
[1:56:59] again the right season the right way the
[1:57:03] right time then he said okay since you
[1:57:08] believe
[1:57:10] sister ask anything you want you shall
[1:57:13] have it
[1:57:16] now if she had asked for $1
[1:57:19] million it would have appeared right now
[1:57:23] do you know what I'm talking about do
[1:57:25] you know the power
[1:57:26] we power we
[1:57:29] have and right there she had a desire
[1:57:34] she had a need that was bothering her
[1:57:37] for a long time she had three stubbled
[1:57:42] sons
[1:57:43] amen I don't remember I think there was
[1:57:45] three of them and so then at that moment
[1:57:49] she said I want my children safe
[1:57:55] hallelujah amen I want my children
[1:57:58] saved and one by
[1:58:01] one amen after she had said those
[1:58:04] words came bouncing
[1:58:08] there falling down crying and giving
[1:58:12] their life to
[1:58:13] Jesus Hallelujah did you know you can
[1:58:16] give life to something that is
[1:58:20] dead did you know you can give life to
[1:58:23] your
[1:58:25] body you know you can give life to
[1:58:28] someone someone who doesn't want to
[1:58:31] serve
[1:58:31] God maybe your children maybe your
[1:58:34] relative maybe your father your mother
[1:58:37] your uncle someone who says I leave
[1:58:40] those things of
[1:58:41] God did you know you can literally
[1:58:43] create
[1:58:45] something the life which is not there
[1:58:49] and you can speak it into existence
[1:58:52] amen you have that power and
[1:58:55] authority amen when you feel that you
[1:58:58] cannot serve
[1:58:59] God do you know you can be like
[1:59:02] RAB and create yourself that
[1:59:08] life creating building something from
[1:59:14] nothing and that sister had all as
[1:59:17] children give their life to Jesus Christ
[1:59:20] and at another time brother bam was on a
[1:59:23] bank of somewhere
[1:59:25] also a river and then he saw this fish
[1:59:30] it was dead dead it was already lying
[1:59:34] there on
[1:59:35] the and God spoke to him you can give it
[1:59:42] life and he came
[1:59:44] down and touched it and said little
[1:59:48] fishy I give you back your
[1:59:50] life and in the moment did like
[1:59:54] this and went into
[1:59:57] the do you think this is a story it is
[2:00:01] documented it
[2:00:03] happened you talk about prophets
[2:00:06] today in our generation there is no man
[2:00:11] that had a Ministry like that of William
[2:00:16] Bram why because he was the last Elijah
[2:00:22] the last Gentile
[2:00:24] generation but the things we saw in his
[2:00:27] life and
[2:00:28] Ministry is the same thing too we must
[2:00:33] experience because we are under the same
[2:00:37] anointing we are under the same
[2:00:40] calling we we are not
[2:00:43] elijas but we are the people whose
[2:00:46] Hearts have been
[2:00:48] restored and we under that same
[2:00:51] anointing of
[2:00:54] we have that power within
[2:00:56] us because of the revealed word of
[2:01:00] God you know I'm trying to show you the
[2:01:03] power of the
[2:01:05] word that's why for us they call us
[2:01:07] Bible
[2:01:08] Believers because for us we just eat the
[2:01:12] word but you see this word we are
[2:01:15] eating it's not just you know we not
[2:01:17] enjoying it in our
[2:01:19] mind after enjoying it in our mind
[2:01:23] that our spirit goes into our hearts and
[2:01:26] formulates another nature in
[2:01:30] us the nature of Jesus
[2:01:32] Christ amen and and then you have
[2:01:35] another
[2:01:36] life in your life to the extent you can
[2:01:41] also be like
[2:01:43] Jesus and you can literally create
[2:01:46] things amen you see things that are
[2:01:49] going wrong and you can create
[2:01:53] from
[2:01:54] nothing the problem we have many young
[2:01:58] people and even older ones in this end
[2:02:01] time they don't want to do something
[2:02:04] from
[2:02:06] nothing we want big things but we want
[2:02:10] it on a silver
[2:02:13] plate we want big
[2:02:15] things someone will tell you I feel I
[2:02:17] should do a
[2:02:19] business and and they tell them why are
[2:02:21] you not doing it
[2:02:22] said because I have no Capital you don't
[2:02:25] need Capital to start a
[2:02:29] business economics will tell
[2:02:32] you you need
[2:02:35] Capital but that's the economics of this
[2:02:40] world don't say I'm I'm going crazy to
[2:02:43] this
[2:02:43] morning because I'm on another pH this
[2:02:47] morning you don't need Capital to start
[2:02:50] a business you need to hear from
[2:02:53] somewhere you need to hear another
[2:02:56] sound you need to hear a different
[2:02:59] sound when everybody else is hearing the
[2:03:01] sound of
[2:03:03] capital you you are hearing the
[2:03:05] sound amen from another
[2:03:08] real like one time Peter he had another
[2:03:12] sound amen as you know they were looking
[2:03:15] for taxes you know God you know just
[2:03:18] simply spoke to him he said Peter all
[2:03:21] you have known is to fish so just go and
[2:03:24] fish you don't need to do a lot of
[2:03:27] fishing just go and fish one
[2:03:29] fish the very first fish you will take
[2:03:33] out you will just open its
[2:03:36] mouth and there will be money now I want
[2:03:39] to ask you a question where did that
[2:03:41] money come from did it come from the
[2:03:44] bank of
[2:03:45] Caesar and you know it had Cesar's face
[2:03:48] on
[2:03:50] it it looked like it came from the bank
[2:03:52] of
[2:03:54] Cesar but actually it was not from
[2:03:57] Cesar's
[2:03:59] Bank it was from the bank of
[2:04:03] Heaven I want to raise your faith this
[2:04:06] morning to show you we can do the
[2:04:11] impossibilities we are the people that
[2:04:13] are called to do Greater
[2:04:15] Works we the church in the end
[2:04:18] time that is supposed to manifest the
[2:04:21] power of the
[2:04:23] world we must live above our
[2:04:28] weaknesses and P open that
[2:04:31] fish and when he looked inside there was
[2:04:36] money brother Joel there was money
[2:04:40] inside and he picked that money and he
[2:04:44] could F that money and he paid tax with
[2:04:47] that
[2:04:49] money what are you talking about all the
[2:04:52] other brothers were very busy preaching
[2:04:56] while brother Peter was
[2:04:59] exercising creating something
[2:05:03] from they did not understand that all
[2:05:06] the other
[2:05:07] brothers because Jesus told him go open
[2:05:11] the fish of the MTH of the fish remove
[2:05:14] the money and pay your tax our taxes
[2:05:18] your taxes you the disciples and also
[2:05:23] mind so where were all the others they
[2:05:27] were very busy
[2:05:28] preaching doing the work of God why they
[2:05:31] were doing the work of
[2:05:32] God God was already using one
[2:05:35] brother to create something from
[2:05:39] nothing which will benefit all of
[2:05:42] them when you have one son of God who
[2:05:46] has realized who she is or who he is
[2:05:50] then everyone else is going to be
[2:05:53] benefited by the outcome of
[2:05:56] that amen what do we have in this little
[2:06:01] congregation this morning I am bigger

[2:09:28] the Lord for very many uh months and
[2:09:32] interpreting for us wherever we
[2:09:34] went and time came when she broke down
[2:09:39] she she just came to me she said pastor
[2:09:42] I've given everything that I know how
[2:09:44] to but I have no job I have no income

[2:09:51] now suffering what am I going to do and
[2:09:55] she was in my office and she was crying
[2:09:58] and she was crying Oh Glory to God I
[2:10:01] feel the Pres right now and at that
[2:10:05] moment you know I did not know what to
[2:10:07] do talk about creating something from
[2:10:12] nothing her family was almost rejected
[2:10:16] they rejected
[2:10:17] her no one could help her but that
[2:10:21] moment
[2:10:22] you know you know the Holy Spirit spoke
[2:10:24] to me and told me where exactly to go
[2:10:29] and I began reading for out of the Book
[2:10:30] of
[2:10:32] Ezekiel amen can these Dry Bones live
[2:10:36] again I said sister can these Dry Bones
[2:10:40] live
[2:10:41] again do you believe that actually God
[2:10:44] can do this for
[2:10:45] you do you believe that the God who put
[2:10:49] flesh
[2:10:51] that dry
[2:10:52] bone the God who brought life amen and
[2:10:58] S to to that flesh and he brought that
[2:11:02] life into those bodies and there were
[2:11:06] dry bones in a
[2:11:08] valley out of the valley they became a
[2:11:12] mighty
[2:11:14] Army it does not matter women how dead
[2:11:18] they
[2:11:19] were it does not matter
[2:11:22] how impossible it
[2:11:24] was it does not matter how nothing it
[2:11:29] looked What mattered was The
[2:11:33] God Who can create something from
[2:11:37] nothing was right there with the prophet
[2:11:40] Ezekiel and he asked him Prophet
[2:11:43] eel can this Dry Bones leave
[2:11:48] again and the prophet said
[2:11:51] Lord thou knowest he said now listen to
[2:11:55] me son of man prophesy to
[2:11:59] this prophesied to this born and he
[2:12:03] prophesied and when he prophesied you
[2:12:06] know there came a mighty we move of the
[2:12:09] Holy Ghost you know and something
[2:12:12] happened to those bones flesh Came Upon
[2:12:16] him Came Upon him that was the first
[2:12:19] level that was the first SP I'm showing
[2:12:22] you what
[2:12:24] happens when something is being made or
[2:12:27] built from
[2:12:31] nothing it happen
[2:12:34] supernaturally you you cannot control it
[2:12:37] you cannot determine it it is
[2:12:40] Supernatural you can't even stop it when
[2:12:44] the time is right when the season is
[2:12:47] right and at that moment you know the
[2:12:50] prophet God spoke again to the prophet
[2:12:53] and he said Son of Man prophesy
[2:12:57] again the pro problem with us Believers
[2:13:01] we don't like to
[2:13:03] prophesy we always speak
[2:13:06] defeat we always speak
[2:13:08] failures and that's why we see
[2:13:12] nothing because we are
[2:13:15] nothing and nothingness has covered our
[2:13:18] face
[2:13:21] our mind we can't see beyond this
[2:13:26] nothing I am poor I am from a poor
[2:13:31] background listen I saw someone
[2:13:34] right I don't want to be the
[2:13:38] backround that my son will say I'm from
[2:13:40] a poor
[2:13:43] backround no I am not a poor background
[2:13:45] of
[2:13:47] anyone did you get it amen when you say
[2:13:51] from a poor
[2:13:52] backround it means your father was
[2:13:55] poor but I don't want to be anyone's
[2:13:57] poor
[2:14:00] background no I refuse that today I
[2:14:04] refuse that the moment I
[2:14:06] believe stop confessing negative
[2:14:09] things I'm from a poor background I have
[2:14:12] no money I have no
[2:14:16] education I can't even have children I
[2:14:19] can't even get married I think I'm
[2:14:23] ugly you are prophesying those things
[2:14:26] over
[2:14:27] yourself and it will be but today God is
[2:14:30] giving another opportunity to undo the
[2:14:33] bad
[2:14:34] [Applause]
[2:14:35] prophecies when everybody is saying

[2:14:44] bad people have no money we can't sell
[2:14:48] anymore for you a business person

[2:15:51] if you thir and you're not
[2:15:52] married forget about it that is another
[2:15:56] story for us we are in another kingdom
[2:16:00] and this kingdom is telling us we have
[2:16:03] the power to create
[2:16:06] something from
[2:16:09] nothing and at that moment the son of
[2:16:12] man the prophet
[2:16:14] prophesied hallelujah amen and he he
[2:16:18] created
[2:16:19] flesh and then when he prophesied again
[2:16:22] life came into this
[2:16:24] B and they rose up there were great men
[2:16:28] they were great women and they became a
[2:16:31] mighty
[2:16:35] invisible and after the Holy Spirit led
[2:16:37] me to that
[2:16:40] scripture years
[2:16:42] ago to the sister as I was speaking with
[2:16:45] her and I said let us pray and as I held
[2:16:48] her hands and as I was praying
[2:16:51] friends let me tell the holy spirit is
[2:16:56] real we are not talking about a dead
[2:16:59] God let me REM
[2:17:06] my physical
[2:17:08] hotness but another one hallelujah
[2:17:11] hallelujah at that moment I realized the
[2:17:14] holy spirit is
[2:17:18] real and as I was praying with her
[2:17:21] I
[2:17:22] noticed my the atmosphere had
[2:17:25] changed there was a great atmosphere
[2:17:29] there the move of God came down the
[2:17:33] presence of God came down and and words
[2:17:35] began to just come out of my mouth like
[2:17:38] a bullet would come out of a
[2:17:40] g and in the middle of the prayer right
[2:17:44] in the middle of the prayer said thus
[2:17:47] say the Lord you are going to get a job
[2:17:51] it's going to be a big job from a big
[2:17:54] company you will determine how much
[2:17:58] you after
[2:18:00] that I was like what what what just
[2:18:03] happened what just happened but I
[2:18:06] realized I had prophesied but I knew if
[2:18:10] it is a prophecy it's not my mind it's
[2:18:13] the mind of
[2:18:15] Christ and at that moment I told her
[2:18:18] sister wait before you go this was the
[2:18:21] mind of God not
[2:18:23] mine I gave a disclaimer
[2:18:26] there I said I said if it doesn't
[2:18:29] happen then me I will
[2:18:31] repent but God will make sure it happens
[2:18:35] if it is his
[2:18:36] word how long I told her I do not know
[2:18:41] but I told her as God spoke to you it
[2:18:44] not be
[2:18:45] long even as he has said and at that
[2:18:48] moment she left rejoicing and
[2:18:52] happy but do you know what happened two
[2:18:56] weeks two
[2:18:58] weeks 14
[2:19:03] days
[2:19:04] Brother 14
[2:19:07] days that sister came walking into my
[2:19:11] office saying
[2:19:13] pastor I've been given this uh
[2:19:17] interview there's a brother from some
[2:19:19] from another country was connecting to
[2:19:21] Believers here and they were
[2:19:25] looking for someone in the uh in the in
[2:19:29] this in the uh banking
[2:19:34] sector and she must have at least all
[2:19:37] they must have a
[2:19:38] degree as a minimum educational
[2:19:42] requirement and then at least some three
[2:19:46] four five years
[2:19:48] experience and they must have good aary
[2:19:51] skills in
[2:19:53] English and so this sister had none of
[2:19:58] those
[2:20:00] requirement she didn't even have a
[2:20:03] diploma she didn't even have a
[2:20:06] certificate the only thing she had was
[2:20:09] the English she
[2:20:11] knew and she learned when she was in
[2:20:13] Dubai and so here she was using that
[2:20:17] same
[2:20:18] English to serve God by interpreting for
[2:20:22] us from English to her local
[2:20:25] language she was our first interpreter
[2:20:27] in
[2:20:28] Ethiopia and as and so she I told her
[2:20:33] sister why has it come to you
[2:20:36] now because all the other
[2:20:40] candidates did not
[2:20:42] pass the ones who had the
[2:20:45] qualifications and so they have now told
[2:20:47] me to

[2:20:54] doubt it's not going to be
[2:20:57] trying it will
[2:20:59] happen and and one day I remember she

[2:28:36] I'm talking about here is not the
[2:28:39] physical building I'm talking about the
[2:28:42] spiritual
[2:28:43] building amen because the Believers we
[2:28:47] build our spiritually
[2:28:50] but it manifests
[2:28:54] physically we build our
[2:28:57] spiritually when you build your wife
[2:29:00] spiritually you begin to build her oh
[2:29:04] God this is the kind of wife I want she
[2:29:07] she must be like this and this and this
[2:29:09] and this and this you you don't speak by
[2:29:12] your
[2:29:14] mind amen you speak in
[2:29:16] Prayer by The anointing of the Holy
[2:29:19] Spirit

[2:29:35] children it's God that gives
[2:29:38] children you can literally build your
[2:29:41] children you can build happiness in your
[2:29:45] home you can build amen money where
[2:29:47] there's poverty
[2:29:50] where there's no cloes you can build
[2:29:52] cloes
[2:29:53] there your marriage it may not be so
[2:29:57] nice but you can build it over
[2:30:00] again and to those of you who are just
[2:30:03] married you need to build your
[2:30:05] home the Bible says a foolish
[2:30:09] woman PLS her house with her own hands
[2:30:14] down she breaks it but a wise woman
[2:30:18] builds a house
[2:30:21] we are all the bride of
[2:30:23] Christ so we have a house we have a
[2:30:26] family we have a life we are trying to
[2:30:30] build and we are building it in the
[2:30:33] spirit when Peter went down to that
[2:30:36] fish you think he was going to build
[2:30:39] with his
[2:30:40] intellect he was going to build
[2:30:42] according to the word of
[2:30:44] God and when he opened the fish he
[2:30:48] removed the money
[2:30:50] did the money come from God built
[2:30:53] it that's the kind of building I'm
[2:30:55] talking
[2:30:57] about he will bless the work of your
[2:31:00] hand the problem many of us don't want
[2:31:03] to
[2:31:04] build we want things that are
[2:31:06] finished how many are ready to
[2:31:09] build when eel was in the valley eel was
[2:31:14] building he prophesied the first time
[2:31:17] prophesied the second time he didn't get
[2:31:19] tired
[2:31:20] he didn't say God is not true he
[2:31:24] tired waiting for the season of
[2:31:28] God wait wait let me give you
[2:31:30] perspective here

[2:32:47] spoken word
[2:32:51] how many got
[2:32:52] that this written
[2:32:55] word when you read it with
[2:32:58] Revelation it becomes a
[2:33:00] r it becomes a spoken
[2:33:04] word I'm speaking to you
[2:33:07] now even the things I'm speaking
[2:33:09] preaching to you
[2:33:10] today others are hearing many words but
[2:33:14] when it is your
[2:33:16] season you will hear one specific word
[2:33:21] and God that is
[2:33:24] mine now that is God spoken
[2:33:28] word I don't care how well you say this
[2:33:31] ought to
[2:33:33] be all that ought to
[2:33:35] be all this ought to be is got to be
[2:33:39] according to his
[2:33:42] word according to his time and his

[2:34:21] it but Moses was the man that God had
[2:34:25] chosen God couldn't take anybody
[2:34:28] else but God chose Moses to do
[2:34:31] it many of them Paul tried to get away
[2:34:34] from
[2:34:35] it but it's got to be by the one he
[2:34:38] chooses to do
[2:34:40] it I have a
[2:34:42] vision something that is going to happen
[2:34:46] amen and God has chosen me to do

[3:02:13] B in his
[3:02:15] unbelief and God made that down
[3:02:20] when it is the time for your
[3:02:23] visitation and don't believe
[3:02:25] it God makes you
[3:02:30] Dum thank God for anyone who would
[3:02:33] receive their
[3:02:37] visitation we should never be
[3:02:42] offended when God visit somebody
[3:02:50] we are
[3:02:51] Pentecostals we believe in the
[3:02:52] Pentecostal blessing of

[3:02:59] Jesus say they are
[3:03:02] life and zakarias was

[3:03:08] dumb and and and Mary's time for Harvest
[3:03:13] station had
[3:03:15] come and Elizabeth 2 had been
[3:03:19] Vis so one
[3:03:21] time Mary decided to visit
[3:03:25] Elizabeth and she had Mary greet
[3:03:29] her why something had
[3:03:33] happened in the womb of
[3:03:36] Mary was the blessing of
[3:03:39] God was something which was created from
[3:03:44] nothing there is something I'm trying to
[3:03:46] say
[3:03:48] when you
[3:03:49] visit or when you talk or when you
[3:03:54] relate with people who have received
[3:03:57] some Supernatural
[3:04:01] visitation it becomes
[3:04:04] contagious hallelujah
[3:04:07] amen that's why we should look at our
[3:04:12] friend we should look at our
[3:04:15] Associates the people we spend time with
[3:04:19] have they had this phenomenal happen in
[3:04:21] their
[3:04:24] life oh they are still living in
[3:04:27] Canal but if you know what I know and if
[3:04:31] you fail what I fail then this gospel
[3:04:35] will mean something to
[3:04:38] you and when you speak to people they
[3:04:41] will stop and listen to what you have to
[3:04:46] say and what are saying will change
[3:04:50] people and Mary was no longer a
[3:04:55] common something
[3:04:57] Supernatural something from nothing had
[3:05:01] been created in
[3:05:03] her and then Mary Oh Glory to
[3:05:07] God Amen that's why this brother had
[3:05:11] Revelation it's not about shaking of a
[3:05:13] hand of a preer he's trying to
[3:05:15] connect to what is
[3:05:19] that's what Mary
[3:05:21] had amen when Mary received
[3:05:25] something and she quickly went to
[3:05:28] Elizabeth hello

[3:17:05] hallelu don't expect something to
[3:17:09] happen without
[3:17:11] building you need to

[3:17:16] little money
[3:17:18] it looks like so
[3:17:20] small so
[3:17:23] small we are
[3:17:26] building because we have a vision we
[3:17:29] want to have a church of our
[3:17:30] own a place where we can come and
[3:17:32] fellowship and worship God
[3:17:35] freely a place where we can have place
[3:17:39] for our Sunday
[3:17:41] school and things like that what is it

[3:17:57] money to
[3:18:00] give to that unless if you do not have
[3:18:04] this the

[3:18:09] member of this church and you don't give
[3:18:11] towards the land
[3:18:13] fund it means you've not CAU the vision
