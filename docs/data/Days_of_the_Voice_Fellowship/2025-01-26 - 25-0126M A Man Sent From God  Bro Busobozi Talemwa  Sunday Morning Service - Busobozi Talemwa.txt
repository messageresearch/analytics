service to go in your word I ask that your presence will come and you will minister to us every need every desire may you meet us Lord at our point of need this morning Grant it Lord I pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you church God bless you church God bless you church are you happy to be in his presence amen you may be seated for just a moment before we um I just want to greet all of you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I know uh it's time for our students to go back to school you know Seasons come Seasons go and other Seasons come so but you know one thing that is constant is that God is constant and no matter where you are if you uh plunge into the blood of Jesus you know you are safe and our safety is in the blood of Jesus Amen I heard from Sister Joan who I know is following the services uh she went for um um I think it's um a brief training from in one of the universities in India and so she sent greetings to the church um and also Sister Rose I heard from her this morning she said she is not able to uh to come because she had just arrived from the trip to S and a bit we in the flesh but I know she's following the service as well amen and uh thank you so much for the prayers you gave to us last Sunday when we were in L God answered your prayers he gave us quite successful meetings in we had a very good youth retreat there had a young people from I do not know how many but maybe more than 10 churches across the northern region of Uganda and Pastor there Pastor Michael sent greetings and we we really had a good time with the young people there amen and so um before we go into the word this morning I wanted to remind you to hold the carja meetings in your prayers um the uh this tues Tuesday yes this Tuesday I'm going to be receiving Brother Gary walk Pastor Gary Walker at the airport he's arriving this Tuesday um and um then he we will straight away on Wednesday go toja so we are going to be having meetings Ino and meetings also in in mat for the side of nap so that covers the whole of maybe the Believers who might not be able to come are the ones who are a little deeper in the North North North North near near Sudan the ones that pastoris preaches to I don't know if they will be able to come but you pray for those meetings uh is kind of a bit different in that um um so it just requires you to pray for us I took brother Michael there m I took him there the other year it was not easy there's a place where we reached and we were driving and the road ended so I told Brother G are we going to pass he said pastor there there so I said I mean there's no Road he said okay you just follow that path so we we drove we're driving driving and we're just going to meet some believers who are in the in the in the interior so we reached somewhere and uh you know we're just driving through grass and boom we just hit some huge Stone and and uh you know our car got a very big issue and we got stranded there you know we don't get to talk about those things many times so that's why sometimes I just come here and say pray for us please always take it a point and pray because Mission work takes God Tak these people many you know many of them are unreached I don't believe the gospel is only supposed to be preached in cities I believe even in the interior where no one reaches as much as we God has given us the grace to go so when we have guest people like these I know there are many cities where they would love them to go but I I kind of always have a bden I say why don't they go and also minister to the Saints in the rural areas someone come all the way from Australia and then you have him preach at dvf or another church in the city and then he goes back and says I've been in Africa no so we need to take them in the interior yeah but I don't know how the situation there is it used to be that they had um uh instabilities Withers so and you know if they come and find you they ask for money or whatever they can har you uh and I forgot I shouldn't have said that online because if a brother from any this countries he has that he may not want to be taken in that place I hope Brother Gary doesn't hear this so but you know God has always given us Grace so we have to drive a certain certain hours we have to drive certain hours in that area so how many will pray pray for us God bless you and then on Sunday you saw the poster I put up do you have it you should you you have it I think we shared it on the if you could have it and share cuz there are others who are not on WhatsApp who didn't see it so we um we are going to have Brother Gary Walker here at dvf on Sunday morning so you can imagine it's going to be a marathon he's arriving Tuesday when is the day we traveling we shall arrive in the evening we travel to C preach Friday Saturday the we are traving Sunday we are here at so it is it is going to take Grace and then in the afternoon the Lord willing we shall have an interview with Pastor Gary he has quite a wonderful testim a moving testimony you could check it out on the internet he had a terrible accident years ago where he you would say it is impossible for anyone to survive in that but God did a miracle and he survived so I would want to interview him about that so that people can know Our God still does and um I believe his testimony will be moving next Sunday plan to be here morning and afternoon so you can get to hear that testimony he's a very wonderful Minister he preached for us before in Ethiopia and um after here on Sunday uh we will be traveling to Ethiopia E I think in that following week we also have meetings there uh so will you remember that as well in PR amen so on um then this afternoon we are going to be having a business meeting we usually call it a business meeting but it's really you know to update you on um on the on how they has been financially you know you many of you are tith payers uh you give offerings we want you to know how much you have given what it has done what is our uh plan for this year and also we have uh the Youth Camp um and um and the the land fund I'm I I think we are not ready to update you on those two because I'm still praying for a certain plan that I need God to impress upon my heart and then I'll share with you probably after the trip to Ethiopia but for this Sunday afternoon I'd like us to stay behind maybe about 20 minutes we talk about the ties and offerings and the plans that we have for this year amen shall we stand on our feet uh thank you for staying musicians we can brother Ste nice to see

thank you maians God bless you chapter 4 chapter 3: 4 um maybe for the whole story we can begin from verses one and Moses answered and said but behold they will not be believe me no hecken unto my voice for they will say the Lord has not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in thy hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and coat it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord God of of their fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of uh Jacob has appeared unto thee and the Lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was lipos lipos as snow and he and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bossom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh and it it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hecken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hecken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and power it upon the dry land and the water which thou take out of the river shall become blood upon thy dry land and Moses said unto the Lord oh my Lord I am not eloquent neither thereof no since thou Hast spoken unto thy servant but I am slow of speech and of and slow of tongue can you read I think I read chapter 4 can you read chapter 3 from vers 1 you read up to 10 sorry for for fore for you may be seated while you see it I'll just read it again vers 34 when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not n hether put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where thou standest His Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afid to look upon and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large and unto a land flowing with milk and honey amen you believe you're going to that land and to the place but that land is not free he says the place of the Canaanites the Hees the amorites the perizzites the hites the jebusites now there Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression where will the Egyptians oppress them come now thereof and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt amen amen um uh I I wanted to say I also appreciate uh Brother Martin for the service on Sunday how many we are blessed Sunday amen we would like to appreciate you thank you so much for your sacrifice and labors for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and you know we thank God for giving us gifts in the body that can be a blessing to the body of Christ amen and all the brothers that minister in the home CES different places I mean throughout the week Brothers preaching many places this Friday brother Dan preach to us in our home was very wonderful sister MAA you really missed we really had a good but I'm sure he recorded for yeah yeah you listen but we are really really blessed praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so my body is a bit beaten down you know I've been having I was talking to Brother Martin the other and I said but why don't you as a church give me a little holiday I mean it is and it's another person who told me you cannot power out of nothing you need to the good thing is I'm still young and you know when you get tired you sleep a little bit and you get refreshed but not 100% and the problem is it accumulates and someone told me why don't you take a rest I said taking a rest means money so if you can sponsor me to go for rest I would appreciate that you know uh I was just looking at since last year you know we were we have been all over traveling all over the north west from there we went to Kenya from there we you know we had meetings here and you know all these other trips we've been having but I know that God is our source of so this morning I need a little help from you to preach amen if you can say Amen then I can be encouraged to amen oh that is not encouraging me are you going to encourage the word this morning amen well you just encouraging the preacher not the word so this morning I want to speak on a very important subject and I've titled it a man sent from God um I preached this some place but I think it comes to a Time some uh sometime where Believers have weird questions questions like um why do we quot William Brother Bram whenever we are preaching why do we talk about brother Bram as our prophet who has those questions now be a Christian be a Christi okay I say a few hands okay I see a few honest hands the others don't want to lift the pastor may mar me and say I'm an unbeliever it's all right to have question maybe for your comfort I also had th those questions when I first came to this message I had questions like that every time the pastor reads a few scriptures and more scriptures but for every scripture he reads he also says brother say and he reads for us what he says so would get confused I would say who is this brother why do they always have to tell us what he say why don't they don't why don't they just tell us what the Bible says but one time God opened my mind my spiritual mind and I understood when he reads me what the Bible says is actually not reading to me what comes out of God as a voice from heaven is reading to me what the man of God Jeremiah said what Paul said what Peter said what you know John said you know what Luke say what Matthew say who are these These are men of God the voice was good and then now it just went off so I if you could help me with the sound I would appreciate it so much okay now uh this God uses men tou your neighbor and tell them God uses men God always uses men there has been no time in in history where God did not use a man a true uh God follower the statements I'm going to make today in the preaching sermon are very important I may not be long but I want you to just follow them this is some kind of teaching Pastor someon it may not be all about excitement but is going to have a lot of learning so I want you to sit and listen but say Amen don't just listen amen and so God has always used men there has been no time in history where God spoke to men without using man show me at the time when it comes to God ministering to men he uses a man you know I'll give you an example right out um right at the beginning here there is a man called Cornelius was a good man he was a a prayer Warrior and he a man who usually gave to the necessity of the Saints he was a good man and he was um you know having a group and they were always in prayer and one time you know they were praying for God to speak to them and for for God to visit them and you know God did not just come down and visit them by osmosis or even by the spirit what God did he turned to Cornelius through the visitation of an Angel and we believe Angels still visit today it doesn't matter a person is religion as long as their heart is right with God have a hunger to hear from God an angel can visit them and an angel visited told Cornelius send a man to go to Jer there is a man there that I have prepared his name is Peter he's at such and such a place send him to go there and tell him to fetch him to come and speak to you my words that same Angel who came why didn't he tell Cornelius the words of God I will give you the answer because this was an angel God does not use angels to preach the word he uses men to preach the word to men but he uses angels to bring a specific message just like he uses anyone to give a prophetic utterance or a tongue and interpretation angels are simply Messengers they are not preachers are you following me now and then also at the same time he visits Peter and he tells Peter now prepare yourself of course you know the whole story the coming from heaven and a voice told Peter kill and eat Peter was a Jew there was all manner of animals according to the Jewish tradition they were not eating things like pigs and other things and but all those things were there Peter said no Lord I cannot eat that which is uh Unholy I cannot God told him by a name Ang you know God uses Angels who are you to call Unholy what I have made holy he said I have cleansed it but you see that was a sign because Peter is a man who belied that God only speaks to the Jews but God was showing him it was now the time for God to begin speaking to the Gentiles also the same God of Israel is the god of of the Gentiles we don't have another God our God by the way is the god of Israel that's why a true Christian will always be a supporter of Israel can we say Amen to that and now you know the Peter received that Revelation and that understanding of what he had to do and while he was there God told him I've sent you a man and this man came and told him that God has sent us Peter had received a message like coreli haded a message why was God doing that God was connecting a man sent from God to people who needed to hear from whenever you have a spiritual hunger in your soul God will send send a man to come and give you the spiritual food in this season and remember Jesus is the same yesterday done for however he has done this in the past he will do it the same way Hees change the pattern God has a pattern and that pattern does not change and so God sends a man and Peter went and preached he preached you know repentance and and he preached to them about Christ and he preached them they received the gospel and as he was preaching they received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and Peter told them since you have received the Bap of the Holy Spirit can you now be baptized and they were baptized in water in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the message which Peter preached is the same message which Paul preached the same message which Luke preached it does not change how you are able how are you able to know that a man is sent from God his message will not conflict with the messages of men that we are sent from God it will always align it will always be the same because listen if my source is God and someone else comes Brother Martin brother Julius Brother D or any of these preaching Brothers if our source is God we will say the same thing we will preach the same gospel it will not change even a bit so you see God used a man God has always used men there is no time in history in Bible History and in secular history where God did not use a man and God always has a witness a witness somewhere even today God has a witness and in every place God sends a man in every locality God sends a man but you see people always don't want to believe in a man they want to believe in something they don't know they would say why doesn't God come down in a powerful way and speak to me the powerful way God speaks to you sending a man and if you don't believe that man then you will perish I'll give you another example before we go into this there was a you know man that went to hell the Bible speaks of him and when he arrived in hell he realized it was too hot and he he told Laz he told you know Abraham father abrah okay if Lazarus will not give me some little water if because he told him there is you know a very big you know suspension between you and us we cannot come then and you cannot come here so the man had another request to make he said this at least let me go to my people on earth when they see a man from the grave someone who had died and is risen and they see me they will believe that God is real and and and and I mean the man now became a preacher everyone in hell is a preacher if God was to release the souls in Hell come out shouting Jesus is Lord hallelujah but they don't have that chance you have that chance now seese the opportunity inh the shout but friend if you shout here glorify the name of Jesus you will never shout in here because you use your opportunity well this man became a preacher he became a charismatic he said let me go I will preach to them and I will tell them you know Jesus is Alive and and and Abraham told him uh sorry that is not possible on where your people are they are preachers if your people will listen to those preachers then they will not come where you are I am one of those Preachers by the way this is reality they are preachers all over the world preaching the truth of God scpt the truth of God is what if people hear them they will never go to hell but do people always hear them no one time they used was preaching and you know he was you know you know heating on immorality and and how women how the devil is making them dress up naked and everything and um you know while he was in the church he saw a woman who was SE on the front seat know she had a minister soam removed his court praise God and they said sister do you mind if I can cover you and the sister threw it away and blasphemed and walked away the next time brother bam called was called that woman was Dy calling the name of brother BR that he should come and pray for him begging and crying and you know by the time brother bham went you know the woman was already where did she go you think straight to Hell well because she rejected the man and even today people reject men and another thing people always accept men that God sent before they they accept men God will send I will show you yeah God is going to send Elijah in the future you will say amen I will tell you God s elah you say amen and then I tell you now in our time God has sent Elijah how many are saying amen very few in our generation but there are people in this world they may be the minority but they have recognized that God has sent Elijah in our last days praise name of the Lord a man sent from God all right so that's just for uh for a foundation here now so let's get into the teaching now you see Israel was a convenant people and you know from Abraham to Isaac then on to Israel they had this conf God promised them a land flowing with mil but you see under Joseph they went to Egypt under Joseph during the time of the of the of the Pharaoh that did not know Joseph these Jews became slaves they were oppressed they were tormented I'll tell you one thing when God makes a promise his promise can never fail God can not forsake his elect wherever they are God will always find he will always find them and how does he find them he sends a man to call them out amen they may be in sin he will find them they may be in denominations in Catholicism in angc all this Pentecostalism you know what he will find it some of us were there he found us he called us out they may be in the world drinking sming immorality CLS he will always find them they may even be in witchcraft amen right now as I'm talking some of those seed of God they may be you know now smoking a pipe and calling but if they have a seed of God let me tell you God will always find them he would find them they may be in suffering he will find them they may be in pain they may be in distress they may be in oppression they may be in depression they may be in sickness if you are an elect of God He will always find you wherever you are his love go to the highest star his love go to the lowest whereever El is God has a mission and the mission is to find them and that's why he sends Men He anoints men man speaks as if he has a spell him what is anointing anointing breaks the York and what is anointing anointing is the grace of God to find the lost God anoints men sometimes he sends them to plead for the lost to the Dy sometimes he sends them to rebuke them sometimes he sends them to call them entice them different Ministry he sends them to why because God has a mission is to find a lost Ones is to find the seed of God I was one of them and I was lost in denomination oh God found me God found me God found me let me tell you if you're a SE of God even when the devil attempts to put you in sin God will ensure he will have a plan to pick you out of there hallelujah amen sometimes he would send a man sometimes he send a woman sometimes he will send you some you know what God will send someone no matter what and you know what there is something already in your soul which will believe the man sent from God and the children of Israel became oppressed and uh you know when God wants to find his children who were in Egypt oppressed tell me Church what did he do what did he do he sent a man shout it he sent a out oh I feel religious this he sent a man he sent a man he will send a man he will always send a man everyone will believe in that he will be sa that man is not is not the thing but that man always you to the promise every true child of God will never worship a manize when God sends a man when a man is sent from God and he stands on the p and he begins to preach no matter how old he is he may be so young he may be so old he may know how to speak he may not know how to speak but something in you recognize is a man why by a gift by an anointing he can be able to reach to your soul hallelujah hallelujah so we don't we are not men worshippers but we are men followers someone did not get that true children of God are not men worshipers but they are men followers if you can't follow a man you can never find God every man who has followed a man sent from God found God so when Israel was oppressed in Egypt God sent a man and this man is voice you know God could trust God could use this man's voice was the voice of God let me show you something in the book of Isaiah 40:3 he says the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our to you who are Bible readers I would like you to reason with me this morning I want you to answer me this question who is this scripture where is it who who is this scripture speaking about a voice of him are we studing together a voice of him that cth in the wilderness make straight in the desert a highway for our who is he talking about who louder John the Baptist oh I have good Bible reader John the Baptist so do you want to say John the Baptist is the voice crying in the wilderness yes everybody say yes John was that voice he was sent before the Messiah came and his work was to prepare for the Messiah to come how did he prepare by speaking to the Jews telling them repent for the kingdom of God is so John was the voice crying out of the Wilderness what is the wildness it is where he was leaving John was a the son of a priest but the moment he was born you know he went into the Wilderness he was eating Locust and wild but you know he would come out and speak and prophesy he had dreadlocks someone who the religious cires canot receive that's the one God used God is still in the same business God is a very good movie Act not even a movie actor he's a good movie director he puts a man there and everybody would say this one is not sent from God and then God watches but the seed will hear that voice why does God do that to confound the wisdom of the wise but the simple in heart they will melt at hearing of the voice when they hear the voice they will say that is my shepherd they don't see the man they see the shepher who is the shepherd David say the Lord is my shepherd I shall not he leadth me to the path of right his name yeah even though I walk through the of the Shadow day I will fear no evil I tell you what the voice of a man of God is the voice of God to you when you hear him speak you will hear God speak that to you is the word of God [Music] so John it was not John it was his voice was a voice of God he was speaking on God's behalf do we agree with that come on don't be cold on me this morning if you are not understanding everything say Amen by faith hallelujah oh I'm so happy with this subject I'm going to preach it very happy until some of you who are sudden groy will become 37 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he does what he reveal his secrets and his Serv the what the prophets you see brother these scriptures some people have never read them make sure today you put all the SC as much as you can because I may quote is it in the Bible the Lord will do nothing tell your neighbor God will do nothing someone didn't get that let me repeat it there is nothing God can do without sending a prophet do you in every major time before let me show you before God destroyed the world with water he sent Prophet no before he destroyed Sodom and goor he sent Messengers before the world before he came to the world the mesiah he sent a prophet job before the end time the Rapture he must send another prophets when they come they areen in the hands of God and God is the one leading them they are men like us but God uses them in a special way for us to be able to see God and understand what he's saying so wise man will always hear that voice amen you know a messenger a prophet is a messenger and a messenger is a star so you see the world has stars people they call Stars people who go and take and you know make them dance their with you know imagine someone in a club dancing dancing where are they dancing where are they going they are dancing moving moving they are dancing their way to hell you know there used to be a man who was actually a colored man a black man someone remind me his name Michael Jackson Michael jaon Michael Jackson Michael you know he would dance I don't know how to dance like him you know he was so gifted and he would dance to the extent that people would run crazy would put his music on his Crusade I don't know they Crusade whether it's a crusade or where people had gathered and you know before you would come out this is literally there you can go check it out only don't don't listen to that music too much because you may also end up and you know the moment they put out music oh You' find people shouting they pass out and they bring stretches put they the that is a Church of Satan and those men I agree they are anointed they are anointed by sat to make these young people that's their way to worldly music is Anointed it is Anointed to take you to that's why when you listen to you get addicted you get addicted to it you want to stop it but you somehow you feel you are connected when you listen to him even when you had said for this year but when you hear it you begin feeling it let me tell you Brethren those men are anointed to sing and dance their to hell but God also has an he said God has an army of men and women that are anointed to T people to Heaven by your music by your dancing by your testimony it becomes music to people where they feel addicted they I want to go to church and hear the sermon being PR I want to listen to that music I want to hear that sister s let me tell you when they sing people who are gifted the spirit andjoy enjoy why it's not just entertaining the flesh something is happening on your it is an anointed person anointed to take you somewhere and so like the devil has men God has men the devil equips man God equ God chooses a man in the world the men of the devil are called stars is that right the star who is the star right now star stars but I'll tell you what those are fallen stars it is good who has stars that are still in the constellation Oh Glory to God God has seven powerful stars to the seven Church Ages Every Church age he sends a star to him every church he send that what is that star we shall see it that star the voice of God means messenger our messenger is our star that's why we always quot him that's why we always say what he say God his messenger his voice is God his voice to our generation and if someone doesn't like it I just feel sorry for you because youve not yet understood what you really are now let me give you a little more scriptural context go John chapter 1 6 all right he say there was a man sent from God whose name was John oh I love that one now I love that one now can we read it together 1 2 3 go there was let us do it again did you hear that people don't like that there was a what a man sent from God whose name was the same came for a witness to Bear the witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that was the True Light light every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him now that is a scripture in the Bible but let me read it in the context of my generation the ones who don't understand the Bible they will be shocked they will feel bad they will feel things and they will be offended but the ones who understand the Bible it is not a history book it a continuous book they will understand what I'm reading there was a man sent from God whose name was William Bram the same came for our witness to Bear witness of the life that all men in this end time bear witness will believe rather he was not that lightam was not that light I say again brother Bram was not that light but he was sent by God to Bear witness of that life and he says that was the True Light what is the true light Jesus Christ he is the light of the world a true Messenger will be sent to Bear witness of Jesus Christ and he says that light was the True Light which light every man in the world that that cometh in the world brother he was in the world he's talking about the light now Jesus he was in the world and the world was made by him this light Jesus he made the world for us our our Jesus is not the second person of the TR our Jesus is the creator of Heaven and Earth there is no above after him he is the above is the man on the top the Bible says let this mind be in you as also it was in Christ Jes who was in the form of God he was God himself and he thought did not Rob to be with God he never made himself equal with God but he was found in a fashion as a man he was gone but he HED himself even to the death of the Cross because he was in a fashion as a man God became man in order to display his life to the human race and then here he says he was in the world world was made by him but the world knew him not why did they not know him why did they reject I will tell you why because he came as a man amen men don't accept men but God said my sheep they know my voice my sheep they know my voice and he said let me go let me go into the world as a man no problem others will reject me but my sheep they know my voice when they hear it they will accept they will come to me [Applause] hallelujah oh my my it's quite interesting isn't it say I believe the Bible I don't it's just like saying I believe the Bible I believe Paul it's the same old Spirit even among some religious men they will tell you I believe the Bible but Paul some places he was not inspired Paul he had a problem with women that's why he told them they should not teach you see even he not marry Paul had a personal problem with women Paul was a woman hater Paul he had an issue with even Corinthians because in the church so he told them women should be silent Paul was a character and now when they come to theology they debating what do you think about Paul how do you see this one those are people who are uh uh want to explain or Reason the word we do not reason with the word When I See This Bible I don't see Paul and Peter when I see these words I see God at one place Paul said let your women be silent in the church God is not the author of confusion but then he said If any man is contous we have no in all we have no such custom in all churches of God and he said this if any man say God has sent them let him also know that God has sent us another place Paul say let it be known that the words I write to you are not my words but they are Commandments of God Paul said that why do you think he said that because people were rejecting Paul's words because there are places where Paul will say this is my opinion there are other scriptures where Paul will say this is not me this is God so which one do you take the one where he said is my opinion or the one where he said is God long as Paul said it it is the word of God to me why I tell you why because Paul was a man sent from God hallelujah I would rather take an opinion of a prophet then take a presumption and a prophecy of someone who God never said When God Says I am with this man so everything he says to me a Believer I take it as the word of God I don't care who says word if I believe God has sent this man even his opinion even his ideas as long as God allowed him to say I believe it is God one time brother bam was preaching and uh he was answering questions I don't remember the question he was answering and then he reached in the middle after answering the question and then he said wait something is wrong wait everybody okay no sick person no no problem everybody fine until the Holy Spirit it is the question you answer yes I answered it wrong I answered it wrong and then he went back again to and he corrected it talk about God standing with his man that book the questions and answers it's not ideal where he did not know he said I don't know where he knew he gave the whether it's about women's hair or it's about church order take it th say the Lord today's sermon is for believers I'm sorry our visitors you might as well believe today today I am not serving milk we are trying to deal with some meat here who will pull some meat don't get offended receive it and say Amen all right God uses men all the time the man is not the light the man Bears witness of the light we are not men worshippers no we are not men worshippers we don't worship brother B we don't serve brother this message is not brother brother was a man sent from God bear witness that Jesus is Alive am it is not him that God used alone there are others God used like him before and there are others God is using today but listen to this in every generation there is one major prophet in every generation there can be other Prophet but there's always one major prophet who the word of the Lord comes to okay let us get deeper into the scriptures Jeremiah chapter 1 vers four then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the bell I knew thee and before that came forth out of the womb I Sanctified and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nation am then said I oh Lord behold I cannot speak for I Am a Child praise the name of the Lord let me say this friends when God has a work for man begins working on him before he is even in his mother's this is true for Major Prophets it's also true for normal preachers if God has his hand upon you to do the work of God He will always protect you before you are born when you in the wom after you born he will always watch over you you are special in his hand because he has a work for you to you understand what I'm saying he has a work for you to that's why when it it comes to a minister of the Gospel you know someone might have a gift but if their life has too many corners their Ministry may not be successful so then what because God knows men have a problem believing in men but now a man who has many corners in his life a man finds a very huge problem in imagine if I had three wives and I come to preach to you you're all quiet because you're beginning to doubt now or maybe does he have them the moment you even hear a rumor Pastor did blah blah blah I even feel like I don't want to go to church again the moment a pastor becomes sinful let me tell you the whole church will be that's the truth if a pastor is a womanizer all the brothers in the church will be if the pastor is a smoker the people will become SM why anointing flows from the head all the way to the and that's why it is important the ministry you feed from we don't want only the gift we want the life the devil is gifted but he has no life of the world that's why for me when I'm trying to encourage young preachers I don't look only at the gift I look at the life if I see Life as Corners I will not I I will I will be I will not encourage that gift because I don't want to bless what God has cast I want to bless what God has blessed there is no man who can send a man it is God who anoints a man and he sends a man he told Jeremiah here before I formed thee in the womb I knew thee before you came forth out of the womb I Sanctified the and I ordained you to be a prophet so God is the one who for knows sanctifies and ordains a minister and especially a prophet for a generation and every God called man will always try to run away from the job how you know that God has called a man he will never want to become something some big shot no no no I'm the one who can do it very well many times when they ask you know when you when when you ask to minister you will feel insufficient no no I I no please why because because you know it's not your ability you always try to run away there is something God depos and he pulls many of the preachers who preach the gospel are pulled into the gospel they would have become very successful in the world they had dreams in the world but God breaks all that and he says I want to use it and then he brings them them and they fulf everything else and they focus on his work let me tell you God is still doing the same thing and we see that brother Bram was a very uh from a very poor background but from the time of his birth God declared he knew him the P of fire came right there came right there in the Log Cabin I wish you had that I didn't plan to say this so you have a Lin and give it to us where he was born his parents were so poor that they were living in log cabin but you see it right in with then like things like that in the window the light came through anded over that CH to signify a prophet is born today when he was seven years his father a maker of moonshine you know as he was going on the river to F water for his father out of the tree came a whole and a voice came out and him by name said William what is it voice said Never Smoke never drink never defile your body in any way because I have a work for you to do when you get older and he was only a little boy of he took off and went to his mother said Mommy a voice his mother said it was justan and then he took him to bed but God continued revealing himself and later on in 1933 you know when he was baptizing you know having a little church baptizing and out of that that same pill of fire the same that Paul saw the same that the children of Israel we are talking about God beinged out from the pages of the Bible to reality people saw some people heard thousands of people in the River Bank River oh in America and a voice came out of that and said and say this words he said John the Baptist was sent forth with a message to for on my first coming your message will forward on my second people heard that he was baptizing in the 17th person so who are you to say William Bram was a for when God himself came down and said here is a man I have sent to you God still uses men the Bible says he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet we receive the prophet is reward we are those oh my God who have received a prophet our generationen I am just one of them they are many like me do I have some here do I have some here do I have some here and they are all over the world they in America they in Cong in Tanzania in Australia they in Ethiopia they in wherever even on the islands yet William Bram he never went there he never preached there he never sent a message there what is it God himself moving his world to restore people back again to the world William bram's message was was a witness to the light this is more than a church more than a prophet more than a this is not some kind of theology it is God sending a man to bring the light of his word back against and later on you know God would meet him in a cave and and and tell him how he would take the healing to the peop of the world you know with the sign of the hand and with a designment and everything happened and you know brother kept on talking about the P he kept on talking about it when he would design the people he would design them he would say I see a light on top of your head and out of that light he would begin to know everything about you I what was that light it was the log which came out of what was that it was Jehovah God the old trying to show the Y when when when when Paul asked who are you I am Jesus that Pillar of Fire the same which led the children of Israel theer it came in our day it came in our generation and one day as he was preaching you know he some people you know sent him out and and you know some Baptist they told him come we want you to prove your theory of Divine Healing you are saying God can heal people by prayer come and prove yourself and he said I cannot go to the you know it was in Texas this later on he came one of his associates he was a veteran preacher you know he was a veteran preacher meaning he had preached for very many years he was in his 90s he begged brother B he said let me go and prove it to them he said he said by by the boss I don't believe in Deb the I will not debate I not fast I would just go and tell them so he told me all right you can go and then by the BAM followed secretly he went and said and as this man you know people were talking and later on the Holy Spirit came to and on him to go that pill of fire came on him to go God speaks the same yest he told him now go I am with you so he went on the ppit he had a little piece of paper with a few scriptures and as he came on the pulpit that pit of fire was there knew was there people did not know but he knew and there's this man who was who had had a photographer you know he he was standing around there he would put that brother like that tell us what so that so that they can take that snap and and then it can go and and be put in the newspaper said Dr best corrected by William BR many pictures were taken this you know what happened as they took those photograph that pit of fire was right there on top of his head you know what the man who took the pictures all all the pictures on the on the film was that only the seventh picture which is this one came out and you know what what happened the pill of fire killed all the darkness of the other pictures and this one came out and the P of fire was there the United States of America as a government recognizes this picture it let me tell you let me give you a little more details this picture was tested by a man called George Lacy who was the head of the FBI questioned document and he wanted they wanted to investigate this to try and see was the light there was it reted was it fake or what and they approved and confirmed that this is the only superal being that was ever photographed a camera that light right above there there is another picture I don't know whether you can find when he has a picture a paper like that speaking this one was like cut off but you see there's this other bigger one you that picture we always look at that pill of fire can you believe it that that is the same Pillar of Fire that was with Moses that made Paul they took this picture in Washington DC and they kept it in their record there's a video on the internet when Brothers Believers of this message they went into that Library check where it is there and video record when they god Jehovah God accepted to be photographed with a man he sent in our generation William Bram William Bram had the biggest healing campaign since World War I he was he was he was it was saved he was the initiator of the post World War II charismatic movement heing Revival that is why people like Ben they know and you have heard their testimonies they know all of old and he spoke statements which even me I cannot preach he spoke statements and I quot I saw God in that man PR he had failed in his ministry but when he came in the Min he saw a child getting healed he said he locked himself up in a room he said if this is the truth and if that power is from you God I want to see it in my Min or I die from here God gave it to him even came in this country but where did he begin from the meeting of so I can officially say even the p moov in ugand started with the Min of will only the majority they were so obsessed with the power and miracles of the life and Ministry of William is what you need it's what you need Jesus had many parts of Jesus had healing signs and wonders but had another part which many people did not like very much the opening of the word which we call the third pool the third pH of the ministry of Jesus and every man of God has those three faes signs and wonders designment and then the opening of the world so many of these brothers they believed William BR to be a man of God simply because his prophecies were right his designment was correct there was never a Miss heed the sick the lame walked the dead were raed signs and wers they all belied man of God but when brother Bam's Ministry turned from a healing Evangelistic Revival ralist to the prophet who would open the word the Elijah that would restore the word to the church straighten up the wrong doctr many turned away from him they say is a false prophet so he's a true Prophet when he's doing Miracles but he's a false prophet it tells you you are teaching there is a problem they misleading the people it seemed as if the Min of but let me tell you the word of God is like a seed when it has been planted it cannot die a messenger as witness of the L the people see the life they walk in the life and that life can never die as I speak to you today there are believers of this message in every corner in the world and yet we have no headquarter brother no headquarter what do we do simply believe the word so what am I saying we are not followers of a man we are the true followers of Jesus Christ amen praise God when God calls a man he calls the unqualified one he trains him he equs him and then he sends him maybe God is calling someone you might say I am not trained I am not equipped I am not un qualified don't you worry brother sister God will qualify you God will train you God will equip you God will send you out and when God sends you he vindicates himself if God sent you let him take care of you if a man sent you if a church sent you let it take care of you but I have some preachers that I know and I just happen to be one of them we are not sent by a denomination we are not sent by an organization we have not Bishop over us we are sent and equipped by God to reap the devil apart we have a commission from God the world the world is soon ending and the Rapture is soon happening and the children of God are preparing and God still heals God still delivers God still sets free do Miracle we are commissioned by God to preach that and let me tell you we have seen lives change even the wor SE as theer I don't care about those who are just coming around to say it doesn't work it works I have seen it works if you have seen it I want you to shout two times it [Applause] works hallelujah amen and someone came to me the other day and said you know what the message is working for me but you see when it comes to financials it is difficult I said do you pay your tith he said no would you give off no it's a principle if you do not pay your ties you don't give offerings your spiritual life will go down down down down even when you a beli of the message the message does not miraculously make you rich this message did not come to make us rich it came to amen amen P away for us to know the True Light so we can receive the reality of Christ in our soul so that we can be better prepared for if you want to be rich there are two things you can do give your ties without fail give offerings support the work of God and lastly work if you are lazy you will not be blessed God blesses how does he bless through the work of our heart God does Miracles how do they do it through the work of our hand has given you a mind he will give you a thought miraculously and he make you a millionaire that's how God works that's how we are being taught by our prophet and you tell me I shouldn't follow the prophet yet is leading me closer to Christ something must be wrong with you remember the 12 disciples they were fishermen John the Baptist was a Bushman he had old looks and and old appetites Moses was untrained and you know he got trained in military God untrained him trained him again for 40 Years brother bam was from p7 you find the things he was saying even psychologists and professors scratch the William brami in his ministry he cracked codes even professors had failed to crack how many have ever heard of the doctrine or rather the philosophy of evolution how many have heard of they man was an animal he just went changing changing and finally he became a man but that Evolution doesn't explain things if Man became was like that why doesn't he if truly man was an animal why are other animals not evolving man brought Evolution because he was confused see there is a connection between and human beings he did not know what that connection but brother bam came and he saw a vision he went right into the garden of and he began to narrate to us what exactly took place amen it wasn't a theological Doctrine it was shown him we now know there is surely a connection but it all started in the garden of Adam we know Cain was not a son of Adam these teachings are supported by this Bible the Bible says love your brethren not as C who was of that Wicked one who did not love his brother and he killed him his heart was that of Satan himself a murderous heart not Adam's heart he killed and God replaced that SE with and you know what we cannot separate Ser SE and go se but the Bible tells us everything is put now down under faith and unbelief if you believe the word the chances are you are a son of God the Bible says today I'm loed I don't know the Bible says that the sons of God he that is born of God listen cannot sin do you believe that what does it mean cannot sin sin is what unbelief now you know how did we know that sin is unbelief by the prophet Through the Bible sin is the unbelief of the truth so a a believer that is born of God will always believe the word so because he's born of God he he cannot sin and believe but the seed of the serpent will always sin they will never believe the word and ande and for them they don't they just they just getting mad you will feel you want to hold and say understand but they refuse because the SE word even if they are wrong say Lord forgive me help me bring me back to your the seed of God in you that seed cannot seem even if you error you want to return that God will have mercy because in you there is a seed of God hallelujah hallelujah now I want to begin descending now I want to begin descending now Exodus 12 let's quickly go there now quickly quickly now Exodus 121 uh we we we can read 15 verses out of that amen and I'm reading in the name of our Lord Jesus the ones of luganda can just follow us and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of the of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the children of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your account for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year he shall take it out from the sheep or from the gods and he shall know shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the on the post on the two side post and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in that night rast it with fire and unli bread and with bitter HS they shall eat it eat not it of it raw nor Soden at all with water but but rust with fire his head with his legs and with his Partners thereof and he shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning it shall burn with fire and thus shall ye eat it with your loons guarded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hands and uh and ye shall eat eat H it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the good of Egypt and I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and he shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your Generations he shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever seven days shall ye eat un living bread even the first day ye shall put away living out from among your houses for whosoever eate the living bread living bread from the first day until the seventh day that Soul shall be cut off from Israel this is the Egyptians also had goats you follow the story have you follow the story there's a revelation I want to get here now let me ask you a question God told through Moses this was the night of the Passover and God told the Israelites to eat lambs every every house and they should then take the blood on door and when the angel of death comes he will pass over them so I have a question for you did the Egyptians also have Lambs okay their LS did they have blood okay could they eat the meat all right there is one more thing he told them they should also eat it with bit HS and uned bread okay so the question is the Jews were living inan were these HS only growing in go no I just answer the question the bread was it only in so we all agree everyone including the Egyptians had the hubs they had the bread they had the lamps and their blood LS had blood and they also had mouth to eat but there is something they didn't have that was a Difference Maker Hallelujah do you know what that was why was it amen don't say shout it why they have a man sent from God let me announce to you child the difference was one thing a man sent from God and I want to say the denominations they have the same Bible we have but their words canot be quickened why the quickening power of the written word comes with the spoken word which comes out of a man sent from God there in a spoken word is rapturing Faith remember faith is a revelation Fai comes by hearing hearing by the word of God 37 God will do nothing but he will send his word to the prophet so when a prophet comes he comes with th say the Lord take BS make it like this do it like this the same Bible they have is the Bible we have but when we we read it we have some ingredients the same ingredients they have but when we take it we apply it differently they they read Matthew 28 go into all the world all the world blah blah blah blah me read it to you go Nations iing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost they read that we read that when they read it they go and begin I baptize you in the name of the father son you who has a man you hear them and you say what did you say no that's not what he say come on I'm rejoicing up here that's not what he say what did he say he said when they see father son Holy Ghost for you you see Lord Jesus Christ they ask you where did you take that from a lot of onions you have to put ons you cannot make without Liv without onion without things but for you you have been listening to a different sound a sound which showed you what you did not know brother and now you can be able to say there should be no k no nothing else nothing but the blood of when they have the father who separate God from the son separate from the Holy Ghost for you you will read a scpt and elah will tell you to read first John 57 there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word the Holy Ghost and these the three so when we when we sing the song How Great Is Our God for them they sing you know we even sing the same song the different Revelation for they see the Father the God for we say you s it wrong for we sing the father the God had three the EOS are getting what I'm saying hu do I have some meaning we don't believe in the Trinity three persons in one they make God like a bunch of GRA but for us we understand God is a spirit God who became the father he became the son he is the holy spirit same God the god three are one why we have a man our women don't don't attack preach pulpits why we have a mans our sisters don't use makeup Hallelujah s why we have a man our sisters don't wear trousers with the high heels with the longer nails painted why we have a man sent from we have ho ghost fi sisters who keep their hair long doesn't touch their because they have read in the Bible where it say your hair is your glory where did we get that from a man sent from God the Bible says if you baptized in much water in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the Holy Ghost we receive the true Holy Ghost not a false one that makes them speak false Tong and because they did they came they filled with the Hool ghost and yet their life is so full of sin oh we thank God has visit our time our generation and he has told us there are Tong which are interpreted tongues of the Holy Ghost and he said Watch The Life That's The Difference Maker in our generation we have so delighted to hear the true voice among many people God has visited our through the man sent from God tell your neighbor man serent seed teaching has been taught Seven Seals have been Tau seven churches have been T we know the message of Israel and the church the true baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when God versus the Trinity we know the truth about women preach we know the truth about operations of gifts in the church we know about the fivefold ministry we know our Prophet is not a pastor a prophet is not a pastor but Prophet the church a prophet can be in the church when he's under a pastor we are being taugh that in our generation we know about the eternal security of a Believer know once you are saved you are always saved am amen we know when you get saved it is [Music] finished somebody has not got it etal security God cannot save you to lose you tomorrow we now have a true revelation we have the true revelation of the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and in the The Book of Revelation 10:7 it says but in the days of the voice of theeven when it shall begin to Ser the mystery of God give me that picture of the church ages the Myster of God shall be finished the mystery of God has been finished we are living in a generation where the seventh messenger has come and his voice has went out just like the voice of Mo of John the voice of theas De Prophet has gone out to do what to finish the mystery of God to Bear witness of the True Light seven Church ages we know the first church age was epes Paul was the messenger and you know it's the age which was aimed at God was moving in power the truth of the word had been brought and we see there comes the second chap this is in the Book of Revelation by you know what is it it's a age of bitterness and death you know when the false Church system started persecuting the but then come the third church and you can see the years down here it is from 53 ad from the days of the Apostles as time goes on Generations would change every generation God would send a star those stars are The Messengers to the churches we see for the Dark Ages persed and then comes pegamos which means married we see at that time the church and the state married together the cathol Church became the state church and we find that now they made the One World Church that's why they called Catholic means worldwide and they began persecuting everyone who is not part of that church but there was a star and there was a message which went and then comes another age at this time means dominating at that time the Catholic church had you know dominated all over the world until today you can see the remnant of everywhere you go the Catholic church is the biggest church by far how did they get members by killing and threatening and all that kind of they killed actually Millions millions of Christians who had refused to bow to their madm religious teachings you know that what I'm saying is proof even if I was taken to court oh I can finish that even recently the pope of Rome was officially apologizing for killing Christians he say is deep regrets that but you cannot take the blood of the saint from your hands the Bible in the Book of Revelations talks about the Roman Catholic Church as a woman as colored woman see that upon many Waters many Waters is the world the of the world covering all over the world but it says drunken with the blood of the S is quite interesting phras and then we see sadis for the next age and God uses Martin Luther and sadd means the escaped on you know Luther was a member and a pre in the Catholic church but he resisted he he resisted the first he protested and with him the Protestant movement started he escaped the false Church system and we see there comes FL and then comes a man John wh that God so used this was a missionary AG where the gospel went all over the world you know between 1750 to 1906 from 1906 the last chch age started that last Church age is called interesting do you know what me people's rights is it not our generation is it not our time dog rights Women rights rights man rights people's rights everything right a child a child can take a parent to the police because he was disciplin rights of children rights of everything you know what we are living in the middle of that generation and we we have witnessed God s sending William BR as the last Messenger to our generation but that messenger would be the Elijah the Bible promised would come can I stand here today and I tell you Church Elijah has come amen give me the last picture brother praise the name of the Lord I'm descending now I'm landing anytime soon praise the name of the Lord and so we see that we have had five comings of Elijah was the first one to come his spe Came Upon elishah then comes John the Baptist will the last elah to the Jews can you put off these lights brother so that the people can see better oh oh these ones okay just put I want people to see this picture as much as they can praise the name of the Lord and so we see the first age all right we see the first Elijah Was Elijah the first K 171 you can read all about about I don't have time to go the scriptures but we see when he left of his Spirit Came Upon Elijah praise God perfect you can see it so a double portion of the spirit Came Upon Elijah Second Kings 2:1 you can read about elah and how the spirit of elah Came Upon then you see there comes the third Elijah now before that thir came in the Book of Malachi there was a proph which said behold I send you Elijah the prophet now we see that that Elijah already come and come but again there was a prophecy that Elijah would come Malachi 31 The Voice the scripture says behold I sent my messenger before and then the Lord whom you sck shall suddenly come into His who is talking about the message of the who is Christ who is God himself before the Messiah would come this had to come what was his name John the bapst but John fulfill the first part of Malachi 4 there was another part which is yet to happen which talks about before the coming of the Dreadful day of the Lord don't miss this part before the Dreadful day of the Lord Elijah will come again the Dreadful day has not yet come are we not still waiting listen before it comes elah must go to the Jews right here but where are we we are right here before Elijah goes to the Jews remember we the Gentiles we are grafted in by Grace God by Grace gives us a portion a portion which was for the Jews hefts Us in there and he sends us an Elijah who was supposed to be for the je but he sends him to the Gentile SP listen listen carefully listen carefully are you hearing are you hear listen carefully William bram's Ministry was so outstanding that it was exactly the Elijah Ministry interviewed him and they asked him a question you going to Israel will be accepted how would your ministry be received and he answered this he said I believe my Ministry shall be received in Israel because the Bible says the Jews seek after signs the Greeks after [Music] wisdom the Greeks after wisdom so in other words his ministry had signs and wonders Des you remember that woman byah Reve the Messiah so he went on the plane to go to Israel but do you know what God came down and he spoke to he said no you cannot go it's not the time listen the ministry he had the exact Elijah Ministry the Jews are waiting for if he had gone there it means it would have confused the whole timeline of God the GLE church had to be served first they had to be raptured first then the Jews receive a so they can so William bram's Ministry could not have gone to the Jews because it was not the time then he understood amen then he understood his ministry was for the Gentiles so by Grace God sent us an Elijah Ministry to restore our back to the P father and that is the ministry I don't have time to go into all the scriptures I'll just send out a link where I explained that of all the scriptures on the on the church if you're not on the church WhatsApp group and you will get that link so you be to listen for about 1 hour explanation that show the coming of Elijah in our time so after a l of our time who is actually William Bram then comes Jesus Christ again for the Rapture of the Bride after that then comes Elijah and Moses to the Jews after that then we now see the Lord coming back again to the Earth together with us who would have been with him in heaven what is he coming to do to rule over the world for a period of 1,000 years will you be in the millennial I cannot wait to be oh hallelujah amen hallelujah and William Bram said this William and I want to finish with this let me Lear with this not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church start some fellowship organization I have never done that and I will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and the people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing what is it that he wanted to see I'm now reading to you in William bram's own words his intention of his ministry that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and where men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and living according to his word I would invite you I would plead want all to hear his voice at this time and he your lives completely to him to who to Christ even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him said he had given all his life and I have given my all to him you all give your life to Christ and he finishes by saying God bless you and may his coming rejoice in your May the coming of Jesus Christ rejoice in your heart God bless you amen amen come on stand up and rejoice because God has sent us a man finally oh there a song which says finally finally let me say finally God has sent us a man who is not interested in starting a denomination who is not interested in men following him that is interesting in bringing you into personal relation with Jesus Christ I say finally we have a true message a message from God and we say hallelujah hallelujah it's a message of redemption it is more
