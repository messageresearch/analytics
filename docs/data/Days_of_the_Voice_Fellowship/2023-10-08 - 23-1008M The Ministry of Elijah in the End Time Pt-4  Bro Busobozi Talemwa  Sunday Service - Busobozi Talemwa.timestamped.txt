[1:29:54] Lord in Jesus
[1:29:56] name
[1:29:59] amen
[1:30:02] amen as we open our Bibles
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:10] please we are going to the Book of
[1:30:16] Malachi Malachi
[1:30:19] chapter uh chapter chapter 4
[1:30:30] amen is that this
[1:30:41] microphone so this verse we have read
[1:30:44] quite a few times now I think this this
[1:30:45] is the fourth
[1:30:50] time but uh we are still building the
[1:30:54] foundation to the to this same
[1:30:57] verse and uh we shall go
[1:30:59] into the depth of it as we continue in
[1:31:02] in this
[1:31:10] series behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:31:13] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:31:14] and Dreadful day of the
[1:31:20] Lord
[1:31:27] and you can be
[1:31:36] seated so we are speaking on the
[1:31:39] ministry of Elijah in the end
[1:31:44] time the ministry of Elijah in the end
[1:31:48] time so this is part four to that
[1:31:54] um the Christian
[1:31:58] world is the Christian
[1:32:00] world is
[1:32:02] waiting for what we call the coming of
[1:32:05] the
[1:32:06] Lord but there are two types of
[1:32:10] waiting you can wait for the Lord to
[1:32:13] come when you know how he will
[1:32:18] come and when he will come or you wait
[1:32:23] blindly but if you wait
[1:32:26] blindly he may actually come and you
[1:32:29] don't
[1:32:30] know but if you know the signs of his
[1:32:34] coming and you know the prophecies
[1:32:37] pertaining to his
[1:32:39] coming you cannot miss him when he
[1:32:42] comes because you were
[1:32:45] waiting if someone tells you there is a
[1:32:49] man coming to do something for for
[1:32:52] you and you know he has a gift for you
[1:32:56] but that man is dressed in a red
[1:32:58] shirt and a black
[1:33:00] coat so when you stand on the on on the
[1:33:05] way waiting for that man you will be
[1:33:08] waiting for a
[1:33:10] man with a a red
[1:33:13] shirt and a black coat but because
[1:33:16] someone told
[1:33:17] you and you've been waiting so you knew
[1:33:21] what you were waiting
[1:33:23] for but if someone tells you there is a
[1:33:27] man coming and is's bringing a gift for
[1:33:30] you that's all you
[1:33:32] know and you wait by the Lord you will
[1:33:36] wait
[1:33:37] forever that man may come and
[1:33:40] pass you may never recognize that he has
[1:33:43] even already come and
[1:33:45] G you will miss the day of your
[1:33:49] visitation only because you did not know
[1:33:52] the
[1:33:55] specifics of his
[1:33:58] coming are you following me this
[1:34:01] morning amen many people this morning
[1:34:05] they waiting for the coming of the
[1:34:07] Lord how many are waiting for the coming
[1:34:09] of the
[1:34:10] lord we all are waiting for the coming
[1:34:12] of the
[1:34:13] Lord you know the whole chrisom is
[1:34:16] waiting for the coming of the
[1:34:19] Lord but the question is
[1:34:22] how many
[1:34:23] know how he is going to
[1:34:26] come and when he is going to
[1:34:30] come very few
[1:34:32] know actually when he came the first
[1:34:35] time you can use that as an
[1:34:38] example the Bible says he came among his
[1:34:42] own you read it in the book of uh
[1:34:47] John chapter
[1:34:50] one
[1:35:01] praise
[1:35:02] God he came unto his own and his own
[1:35:06] received him not this is verse
[1:35:11] 11 this was the listen listen now of
[1:35:14] course during this subject we know that
[1:35:15] we are
[1:35:18] learning so I'm not really preaching as
[1:35:20] much as I always do
[1:35:26] we're just trying to learn a few
[1:35:27] foundations of our
[1:35:31] faith what we believe what we stand for
[1:35:36] so if you learn something new and you
[1:35:37] have a
[1:35:39] question write it down I'll be glad to
[1:35:42] deal with it
[1:35:44] later so now when we talk about the
[1:35:46] first coming of
[1:35:48] Jesus the Bible says he came unto his
[1:35:51] own
[1:35:52] and his own received
[1:35:55] him there are
[1:35:57] prophecies which were given about the
[1:36:00] coming of the
[1:36:02] Messiah all the Jews knew
[1:36:05] it I'm talking about all the
[1:36:09] Jews and all those that were reading the
[1:36:13] Torah they knew the prophecy of the
[1:36:16] coming of the
[1:36:18] Messiah and they were waiting
[1:36:22] but the question is when he came did
[1:36:25] they recognize him they did not the
[1:36:29] Bible says he came unto his
[1:36:31] own but his own received him
[1:36:35] not you know Isaiah is one of the
[1:36:37] prophets that prophesied about his
[1:36:40] coming and isah prophesied and said unto
[1:36:44] us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:36:49] given the Govern shall be on his
[1:36:52] shoulders his name shall be wonderful
[1:36:56] counselor Prince of
[1:36:58] Peace are you hearing me this is a
[1:37:01] prophecy of
[1:37:02] Isaiah he prophesied and the Jews
[1:37:06] believed
[1:37:07] it they believed it they read it every
[1:37:11] time in their
[1:37:13] Temple but here when Jesus came and he
[1:37:18] healed someone on the Sabbath day
[1:37:22] on the Sabbath day he healed that woman
[1:37:27] when they saw that they said what did
[1:37:31] you just break the Sabbath
[1:37:33] day how could you do that and he looked
[1:37:36] at them and he said who among
[1:37:40] you that your when your camel falls into
[1:37:42] the ditch on the
[1:37:45] Sabbath you do not remove it
[1:37:49] Hypocrites you hypocrite
[1:37:52] Christ meaning you to actually break the
[1:37:55] Sabbath
[1:37:56] day and you are here blaming me for
[1:37:59] breaking
[1:38:01] the and then he said come unto
[1:38:04] me that
[1:38:06] La a heavy
[1:38:08] lad I will give you
[1:38:11] rest for your
[1:38:13] soul what the Sabbath means sabath means
[1:38:18] rest but Jesus say unto
[1:38:22] me I will give
[1:38:26] you so Jesus came with the real
[1:38:31] Sabbath people were resting from their
[1:38:34] natural
[1:38:36] works but he had come to give them a
[1:38:40] Sabbath which will make them rest from
[1:38:42] their
[1:38:44] sins from The Works of their
[1:38:47] flesh and he had come to give it but he
[1:38:51] came among his own and his own received
[1:38:54] him
[1:38:55] not what did they tell to him they said
[1:38:59] now we know when he said before
[1:39:02] Abraham was I
[1:39:05] am they said you are not even 50 years
[1:39:08] old how can you say that you were there
[1:39:11] in the Days of Our
[1:39:13] Father how can you say he said if you
[1:39:17] don't believe I am here you will die in
[1:39:20] your sin
[1:39:22] who is he the am the am that Moses
[1:39:27] made the one who said to Moses I am who
[1:39:30] I
[1:39:31] am says if you don't believe I am
[1:39:34] he he that met
[1:39:37] Moses he that was prophesied that he
[1:39:39] will
[1:39:41] come he that created the Heaven and the
[1:39:44] Earth Jesus never said thus say the
[1:39:49] Lord oh the prophet said thus say the
[1:39:53] Lord meaning God is telling me to
[1:39:56] say Isaiah said thus say
[1:40:00] the
[1:40:02] the th
[1:40:04] the Jesus he never said th say the Lord
[1:40:09] because he was the Lord
[1:40:11] himself when he came down he said very
[1:40:15] very I say unto
[1:40:17] you who was that what man of man is
[1:40:22] this that Cals the ring
[1:40:25] SE what man of man is this raises the
[1:40:30] dead what man of man is this he was The
[1:40:33] Lord Of
[1:40:34] Glory he was the
[1:40:36] great he was Jehovah
[1:40:39] God Jesus Is
[1:40:42] God and it's a
[1:40:44] revelation
[1:40:46] received even today in
[1:40:49] our h some people think Jesus is just a
[1:40:52] second person of the
[1:40:55] Trinity there is nothing like Trinity in
[1:40:57] the
[1:40:58] Bible Trinity is a doctrine of the
[1:41:03] Romans it is not a Bible
[1:41:06] Doctrine if you find the word trity in
[1:41:08] the
[1:41:10] Bible praise God come for a
[1:41:14] gift and I will also repent on top of
[1:41:17] that there is no word Trinity in the
[1:41:19] Bible
[1:41:22] doctrine of the of the
[1:41:25] Romans which they have sent all over the
[1:41:28] world but the bride will escape such
[1:41:32] a the bride will believe in the one God
[1:41:35] of the
[1:41:36] Bible the god of Isaac the god of Jacob
[1:41:40] the god of Israel one God he says I am
[1:41:44] the Lord and that is my name and I will
[1:41:47] not give my my my praise
[1:41:51] have Graven
[1:41:54] image praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:41:58] Jesus was God in flesh and when he came
[1:42:02] the Jews said now at first they told him
[1:42:06] now we know you have a
[1:42:08] devil we know the things you speaking we
[1:42:12] can see you have a
[1:42:14] devil and then when he continued
[1:42:16] speaking what they consider to be
[1:42:19] blasphemy they told him now
[1:42:21] you don't only have a
[1:42:23] devil you
[1:42:27] himself they called
[1:42:31] Jesus the
[1:42:33] people who would go back to their
[1:42:36] Temple and they would read unto
[1:42:40] us it's a religious
[1:42:43] service so we are reading the
[1:42:45] scripture unto us a child is born a son
[1:42:50] is given
[1:42:51] and then they come to Jesus you
[1:42:54] are they would go back in the temple
[1:42:57] unto us son
[1:42:59] is the prophec is about
[1:43:02] him and they calling
[1:43:06] him and yet they would go back and read
[1:43:09] about
[1:43:12] you talk about spiritual
[1:43:17] blindness they were
[1:43:19] blind they couldn't
[1:43:22] oh friends I want you to understand
[1:43:24] this who was Jesus he was the one that
[1:43:28] every Prophet spoke
[1:43:32] about all the prophets and the
[1:43:36] Lord pointing to
[1:43:38] him Jesus Jesus was the
[1:43:43] Fulfillment I can talk about Prophet
[1:43:46] Prophet from Prophet to
[1:43:49] Prophet they all prophesied about Jesus
[1:43:53] everything they did was about
[1:43:54] Jesus praise God when you talk about
[1:43:58] Moses in the in the Old Testament when
[1:44:01] he put up that
[1:44:03] stick and he put that Brazen
[1:44:08] Serpent and whoever was beaten by
[1:44:11] snakes when he look or
[1:44:14] not he would be healed what was that
[1:44:19] that was a symbol
[1:44:21] talking of
[1:44:23] Jesus who went on the cross to judge the
[1:44:29] serpent the Bible says he became
[1:44:33] s that we might become the
[1:44:37] righteous even Moses prophesied
[1:44:42] of eel so him as a whe in the midle of
[1:44:45] the
[1:44:47] wheel Daniel he saw a
[1:44:51] Rock which was very
[1:44:55] huge and then there was a hand there was
[1:44:59] a one which was cut out of
[1:45:03] it without a
[1:45:05] hand cut out of
[1:45:08] it and then it
[1:45:11] came from Heaven down to the Earth
[1:45:15] listen you remember the dream of King
[1:45:19] Nebuchadnezzar where he had seen that
[1:45:22] thing and he had seen what is it called
[1:45:26] this um you know
[1:45:29] statue and he had seen it the head of
[1:45:33] gold and you know the the the feet of
[1:45:38] clay and and and you know all
[1:45:40] that but what was that talking
[1:45:44] about listen to me he was
[1:45:48] speaking of the kingdoms of of the
[1:45:53] Gentiles that would rule the
[1:45:56] world from that
[1:45:58] time up to the end
[1:46:02] time that was what it was talking
[1:46:05] about it was beginning with the kingdom
[1:46:07] of
[1:46:09] Nebuchadnezzar the kingdom of
[1:46:12] Nebuchadnezzar was the kingdom
[1:46:15] of was the head of
[1:46:18] God how many are following
[1:46:22] all right so the kingdom of
[1:46:24] nead was the head of
[1:46:26] God and the last Kingdom to
[1:46:30] come was having two things in
[1:46:33] it
[1:46:35] clay mixed rather iron mixed
[1:46:40] with what does that
[1:46:43] symbolize the the because ion is
[1:46:47] Rome Roman power Roman Kingdom
[1:46:51] you know the kingdom of of Rome one time
[1:46:52] ruled the whole
[1:46:55] world but the very last one
[1:46:59] mixed with Clay that's
[1:47:04] protestantism and
[1:47:06] romanism mixed together so it is
[1:47:10] romanism going to rule the
[1:47:13] world the last Kingdom to
[1:47:15] come of the
[1:47:17] Gentiles how many understand
[1:47:22] today I'm going into a bit of deep
[1:47:24] things I want
[1:47:26] follow now but regardless of all those
[1:47:30] kingdoms of course Nebuchadnezzar when
[1:47:33] he
[1:47:34] saw that he was the head of
[1:47:36] God he said okay put that stat
[1:47:40] there and let everybody
[1:47:43] worship when you hear the sound of the
[1:47:47] timos the
[1:47:49] drums
[1:47:52] then everybody shall bow
[1:47:54] down and worship the
[1:47:56] image but yet he was just the head of
[1:48:01] God and he felt so good he felt he
[1:48:05] should be
[1:48:06] woried but there were three
[1:48:11] boys they said We Shall Not
[1:48:14] Bow we shall not
[1:48:17] Bend we are not going to worship man
[1:48:20] we're not going to worship the systems
[1:48:22] of only God we
[1:48:24] shall only God we shall
[1:48:27] Ser today we have a people who will not
[1:48:31] worship any manade
[1:48:35] system we shall
[1:48:37] Ser only God we shall
[1:48:40] worship and and and and you know but you
[1:48:43] see there's another thing
[1:48:45] here that there was a
[1:48:48] stone that came and hit this
[1:48:52] IM and it was completely
[1:48:56] dism destroyed
[1:48:59] completely the image was destroyed
[1:49:03] completely now the image represents the
[1:49:08] kingdoms of the
[1:49:11] world the
[1:49:12] stone
[1:49:14] represents the
[1:49:16] kingdom of Jesus
[1:49:18] Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah the Bible
[1:49:21] says the kingdoms of the
[1:49:24] world have become the kingdom of our
[1:49:31] God if your kingdom is in this
[1:49:34] world it's okay you can go and fight on
[1:49:37] the
[1:49:38] road and you hold
[1:49:44] blackards everywhere
[1:49:46] every but as far as I'm concerned my
[1:49:50] kingdom is
[1:49:54] not yes I know I'm going to rule in this
[1:49:57] world but not in its current
[1:50:02] system when his kingdom
[1:50:05] comes he will destroy all the systems of
[1:50:08] the
[1:50:09] world and he will put another
[1:50:12] system where he is the king of
[1:50:15] kings and the Lord of
[1:50:17] lords and he will rule
[1:50:20] for a thousand
[1:50:22] years and I'm going to be down here ring
[1:50:26] together with him yes I'm going to be a
[1:50:29] ruler Hallelujah the Bible says we are
[1:50:32] Kings and we are
[1:50:34] priests so now Jesus is the one that
[1:50:38] will have an everlasting
[1:50:40] Kingdom if you are part of his
[1:50:43] kingdom I Want to Say You Will Rule with
[1:50:47] him we have a song that says the Saints
[1:50:50] of the Lord shall take the
[1:50:53] kingdom they shall rule forever
[1:50:57] more I will
[1:50:59] rule I'm going to sit in the the day is
[1:51:03] coming I'm going to sit in the thr
[1:51:06] that's why they're stealing our
[1:51:08] soul that when the battle is over we
[1:51:11] shall wear a crown that is our soul we
[1:51:15] have a crown we are going
[1:51:17] to and we are fighting now
[1:51:20] we are fighting with sin but one of
[1:51:23] these days hallelujah oh Hallelujah we
[1:51:27] are going to drop this flesh we going to
[1:51:30] drop this
[1:51:31] flesh Hallelujah just like you will be
[1:51:35] changed no more sin no more sickness no
[1:51:39] more these things no more trouble and we
[1:51:43] shall have a body that cannot
[1:51:46] die we shall have a body that canot not
[1:51:50] sin that is the body that is going to
[1:51:55] rule because it will have
[1:51:58] character will have the nature of
[1:52:00] Jesus but right now we are fighting we
[1:52:04] are fighting brother fight sister fight
[1:52:09] don't accept
[1:52:11] defeat we must fight and
[1:52:13] win in order to rule so even Daniel
[1:52:18] spoke of Jesus
[1:52:20] every Prophet spoke of
[1:52:24] Jesus Jesus and the Jews were
[1:52:29] waiting Isaiah 61
[1:52:32] says the spirit of the Lord God is upon
[1:52:36] me he has anointed
[1:52:38] me brother I wish you would just give me
[1:52:40] that quite
[1:52:42] quickly you know so that I can be able
[1:52:45] to quote it for the
[1:52:48] people praise God
[1:52:52] hallelujah hallelujah the spirit of the
[1:52:54] Lord God is upon
[1:52:55] me because the Lord has anointed me to
[1:52:58] preach the Good Tidings unto the
[1:53:02] men he has sent me to bind up the
[1:53:06] Brokenhearted Amen to Proclaim Liberty
[1:53:08] to the
[1:53:10] captives and the opening of the prison
[1:53:12] to them that
[1:53:14] abound to proclaim the acceptable year
[1:53:16] of the
[1:53:18] Lord these word
[1:53:21] we prophesied by
[1:53:23] Isaiah and Isaiah people did not
[1:53:26] understand but they need was a
[1:53:29] prophecy because a prophet
[1:53:31] prophesies and then here years
[1:53:36] later a
[1:53:38] man are you following
[1:53:40] me and he stands in the
[1:53:44] temple and takes the
[1:53:46] Bible and he find he looks for this
[1:53:50] place he
[1:53:53] looked which means he knew what he
[1:53:55] wanted
[1:53:58] to he looked for this
[1:54:01] place and he read this
[1:54:03] part the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:54:07] me because the Lord has anointed me to
[1:54:10] preach the Good Tidings unto the
[1:54:13] me he sent me to bind up the broken
[1:54:16] heart to Proclaim Liberty to the
[1:54:19] captives
[1:54:21] and the opening of the prison to the to
[1:54:23] them that are
[1:54:25] bound to proclaim the acceptable year
[1:54:29] of when he had read that everybody
[1:54:32] looked at
[1:54:33] him and he said this day is this
[1:54:38] scripture
[1:54:42] fulfilled do you think they
[1:54:48] understood they're like what what what
[1:54:50] is
[1:54:51] talking that is speaking about the
[1:54:55] Messiah hope he's not thinking he's the
[1:54:59] Messiah does he think he the
[1:55:02] Messiah come on this is a son of Joseph
[1:55:07] and Mary he was born in
[1:55:10] Jerusalem these people I believe they
[1:55:13] had prepared
[1:55:16] virgins
[1:55:18] virgins in their temp
[1:55:20] because the prophecy also
[1:55:22] said a virgin shall
[1:55:25] conceive and bear a
[1:55:28] son so they must have prepared
[1:55:32] virgins that the spirit of God will
[1:55:34] choose among
[1:55:36] them in their religious
[1:55:38] system a virgin shall
[1:55:41] conceive are you following me a virgin
[1:55:44] shall
[1:55:46] conceive is it the scripture is it a
[1:55:49] prophecy
[1:55:50] a virgin shall conceive the angel said
[1:55:53] it so they must have waited for it maybe
[1:55:57] they prepared some
[1:56:00] virgins and they waited for the angel to
[1:56:03] come so one of them can
[1:56:05] conceive maybe every every two months
[1:56:09] every
[1:56:10] month they went back to
[1:56:13] ask anyone
[1:56:15] pregnant anyone pregnant no let us wait
[1:56:20] another us with another moreover whereas
[1:56:24] the the organization was preparing all
[1:56:26] those
[1:56:29] things they did not know you cannot
[1:56:31] organize
[1:56:33] God God will do what he has to
[1:56:36] do and He will fulfill his word
[1:56:40] anyway whether people see it or
[1:56:42] not whether they believe it or not God
[1:56:46] will fulfill his word regardless of your
[1:56:53] even regardless of what is going on in
[1:56:54] the
[1:56:56] world religious
[1:56:58] systems they may all reject him but he
[1:57:02] will fulfill his
[1:57:04] word while they were doing all those
[1:57:07] things organizing
[1:57:09] God God was very busy also fulfilling
[1:57:12] his word out of the
[1:57:17] organization we are not an organization
[1:57:20] God is fulfilling his word among
[1:57:23] us hallelujah while the
[1:57:27] organizations see they have God they
[1:57:30] they organized they see they know how he
[1:57:33] is going to come they don't know they
[1:57:35] are blind they don't know they naked but
[1:57:39] there is a bride there is a church all
[1:57:42] over the world God is preparing to
[1:57:46] Rapture a
[1:57:47] bride out of the
[1:57:50] organization out of the systems of the
[1:57:52] world he will leave them in the
[1:57:55] organization while he bundling his bread
[1:57:59] together making us one with the
[1:58:02] word and they were very busy waiting for
[1:58:06] the virgins to
[1:58:09] conceive but God
[1:58:11] himself fisted his
[1:58:16] right
[1:58:17] glory and when came to this
[1:58:20] Mary he said You shall
[1:58:24] conceive he says how shall these things
[1:58:26] be he says the Holy Ghost will overtake
[1:58:30] you the power of the most high will
[1:58:33] overshadow you me tell you how shall
[1:58:37] these things
[1:58:38] be how shall we go in the Rapture how
[1:58:41] shall our bodies be changed the Holy
[1:58:44] Ghost will overtake
[1:58:46] us the power of the most high will

[1:59:10] heal he will heal cancer he will heal
[1:59:14] tuberos he will heal HIV he will heal

[1:59:33] Ghost the systems will continue in their
[1:59:35] own
[1:59:37] ways while he is very busy doing his
[1:59:40] things and then while very bus doing
[1:59:44] that a virgin shall
[1:59:47] conceive can you imagine the Virgin
[1:59:51] conceived the Virgin gave
[1:59:54] birth and they were still
[1:59:56] reading
[2:00:00] vir they were still waiting for prophecy
[2:00:04] to be
[2:00:05] fulfilled which was already
[2:00:07] fulfilled standing before them a virgin
[2:00:11] shall
[2:00:13] conceive you you have you
[2:00:17] B someone needs to see
[2:00:20] I wish someone would open their
[2:00:22] eyes show them this is the one that was
[2:00:29] concealed this is the
[2:00:32] son that was promised to
[2:00:34] come this is Jehovah
[2:00:38] God I wish someone would
[2:00:41] open and that's why Jesus he spoke to
[2:00:44] them many
[2:00:45] times and they said they sons of Abraham
[2:00:50] he said you are not sons of
[2:00:51] abrah because if you were sons of
[2:00:54] Abraham you would have believed
[2:00:57] me why because Abraham Reed to see my
[2:01:02] day and he was glad when Abraham
[2:01:07] see Jesus who was not even 50 years
[2:01:11] old this was not Jesus the son
[2:01:15] speaking this was Jehovah
[2:01:18] God
[2:01:19] Jesus speaking to this people he was the
[2:01:23] one that told Abraham I will be with you
[2:01:28] according to the time of life and your
[2:01:31] wife Sarah will have a child this
[2:01:35] was the one who came
[2:01:38] to in the tent and he spoke to him this
[2:01:43] was the one Abraham PA T
[2:01:47] to this was the one
[2:01:49] asked Abraham why did sah your wife
[2:01:54] laugh this was the one who told Abraham
[2:01:58] Now give me your little
[2:02:00] boy and when Abraham went to
[2:02:03] sacrifice his little boy in the mountain
[2:02:07] his boy cried said father where is the
[2:02:12] sacrifice Abraham said the Lord shall
[2:02:17] prepare a sacrifice shall provide a
[2:02:20] sacrifice maybe you have nothing to
[2:02:23] sacrifice the Lord shall provide a
[2:02:26] sacrifice the Lord shall provide
[2:02:29] a and he will save your children he will
[2:02:33] save your children for you if you
[2:02:36] believe it Abraham said it by faith and
[2:02:40] that's why he's the father of
[2:02:43] Faith because by faith he believed God
[2:02:46] will provide a
[2:02:47] sacrifice and then as he was going to
[2:02:50] kill his
[2:02:51] son god
[2:02:53] Jehovah he spoke to him and he said
[2:02:56] Abraham don't kill your son stop stop
[2:03:01] Abraham just stand by the side there is
[2:03:04] a
[2:03:05] sacrifice God provided a
[2:03:07] sacrifice I believe Abraham Rejoice AB
[2:03:12] say hallelujah hallelujah my son is not
[2:03:15] going to die hallelujah hallelujah my
[2:03:18] son is saved
[2:03:19] Abraham rejoiced and years later Jesus
[2:03:24] is standing before
[2:03:25] them and he saying before Abraham was I
[2:03:31] am and Abraham rejoiced to see
[2:03:35] my Hallelujah it was him that was there
[2:03:39] at that
[2:03:41] time but they had
[2:03:43] eyes they could not see they had ears
[2:03:48] they could not hear
[2:03:49] because they missed the part of
[2:03:54] Prophecy that was going to prepare them
[2:03:58] to receive the
[2:04:01] Messiah they missed it when the Messiah
[2:04:04] came they were blind as a
[2:04:09] BT he was right there before them but
[2:04:12] they didn't recognize
[2:04:14] him have a song in they
[2:04:17] sing
[2:04:20] he came
[2:04:25] to oh are you this
[2:04:28] young you don't know that
[2:04:34] song he came to his
[2:04:37] own the Earth did not recognize
[2:04:40] him he came to support
[2:04:44] them did not know him they didn't
[2:04:46] recognize him was he he was Jehovah God
[2:04:52] in flesh oh hallelujah hallelujah and
[2:04:56] Jesus he came for a
[2:05:00] purpose the purpose was to deliver the
[2:05:04] were in
[2:05:06] prison the purpose was to save the
[2:05:09] captives the purpose was to die on the
[2:05:13] cross but when he came the first
[2:05:16] time they did not recognize
[2:05:20] I ask you a
[2:05:21] question
[2:05:24] why the reason is
[2:05:27] one because they missed the
[2:05:33] ministry which was supposed to prepare
[2:05:36] [Applause]
[2:05:37] them to receive the
[2:05:42] Messiah before the Messiah
[2:05:46] comes oh I feel so so good right
[2:05:50] now before the Messiah
[2:05:52] come there must be an Elijah
[2:05:57] Ministry Elijah Ministry is to prepare
[2:06:01] the
[2:06:02] people to receive the
[2:06:07] messah to receive God when he comes down
[2:06:09] on the sin praise
[2:06:14] God for he says in the Book of Malachi

[2:14:59] come if people saw this
[2:15:03] elij if they believe this
[2:15:06] Elijah they would receive the
[2:15:09] Messiah but because they did not
[2:15:14] know when he came when the Messiah came
[2:15:18] they called
[2:15:21] him because they were still
[2:15:25] blinded they did not receive the
[2:15:28] ministry which was going to help them
[2:15:31] understand who the Messiah
[2:15:34] is oh
[2:15:38] my now John the

[2:16:35] to to to come and do the
[2:16:39] Rapture and also destroy the others he
[2:16:42] coming
[2:16:43] soon but before he
[2:16:46] comes this is the
[2:16:48] time Elijah must
[2:16:52] come anybody who doesn't receive this
[2:16:57] Elijah will not be prepared for the
[2:17:02] Rapture so I don't see how he goes in
[2:17:07] rupture this is a we dealing with Bible
[2:17:09] prophecy
[2:17:11] here Elijah's
[2:17:14] Ministry comes to prepare these people
[2:17:16] here for the rapture
[2:17:21] but if they don't receive this
[2:17:23] Elijah there is no way they will
[2:17:26] go no
[2:17:29] absolutely but I want to declare to you
[2:17:31] today El has
[2:17:34] come El has come this church and many
[2:17:39] others around the
[2:17:40] world telling the world that we have El
[2:17:46] message and message is preparing us for
[2:17:49] the coming of the
[2:17:52] Lord that's why we don't have time to
[2:17:55] make organizations and
[2:17:58] religions we don't have time for that we
[2:18:01] don't have time to make
[2:18:03] denominations we don't have time the
[2:18:06] only time we have amen is to
[2:18:10] prepare for the coming of the Lord using
[2:18:13] Elijah's
[2:18:15] message and I say Elijah is come
[2:18:19] Elijah is
[2:18:20] come and his message is already here if

[2:18:39] sound the
[2:18:41] mystery of God shall be finished after
[2:18:46] him no more
[2:18:49] the only thing
[2:18:50] left is the

[2:19:30] is Elijah is come the mystery is
[2:19:35] finished the Seven Seals are open the
[2:19:38] mystery is finished we are only left
[2:19:41] with one
[2:19:42] thing the
[2:19:44] Rapture I am thinking about the rapture

[2:19:51] people that God is going to

[2:20:11] thing left is
[2:20:14] Rapture hallelujah hallelujah the devil
[2:20:17] can stop
[2:20:18] it that's why our emphasis in this
[2:20:23] church is not bring a
[2:20:25] seed it's not so a SE it's not give give
[2:20:30] give no we believe in
[2:20:33] giving our emphasis is the coming of the
[2:20:38] Lord hallelujah
[2:20:42] hallelujah the devil can't stop
[2:20:44] it because it is too late for him
[2:20:48] elah is already
[2:20:52] come I've been
[2:20:55] watching the other day I was watching
[2:20:59] this preach of ours here in
[2:21:02] CA
[2:21:03] Grace
[2:21:06] a I should have
[2:21:10] AP we need to respect man of
[2:21:13] God and so he he said
[2:21:15] something about William Bram and said oh
[2:21:19] William Bram was a mighty
[2:21:22] Prophet you cannot equate him to any
[2:21:24] other
[2:21:26] in he had a real gift of
[2:21:30] God and he talked about the pill of fire
[2:21:34] he doesn't even understand what of fire
[2:21:39] sign you think God just comes for a
[2:21:43] show this is the same pill of
[2:21:46] Fire the days of of
[2:21:49] Moses this was some of fire that met
[2:21:53] Paul people don't
[2:21:57] understand why did he come to meet
[2:22:00] Paul because he was sanctioning
[2:22:03] Paul for Ministry of the
[2:22:07] AL my God I feel like speaking right he
[2:22:11] was he was consecrating Paul for the
[2:22:15] alpha minister
[2:22:17] of the end time
[2:22:21] bride and when he came on on
[2:22:24] William he was
[2:22:27] consecrating for the Omega
[2:22:30] Ministry of the same end
[2:22:34] time these people don't understand they
[2:22:37] see it is a small
[2:22:39] thing God just came for a picture
[2:22:43] show this is
[2:22:45] prophetic this is
[2:22:49] this is prophesied to
[2:22:50] happen is up to you to open your
[2:22:54] eyes to be
[2:22:56] blind but I choose to open my
[2:23:00] eyes see Bible
[2:23:04] prophecy and Apostle Grace was
[2:23:07] saying but even William Bram you know
[2:23:10] God took
[2:23:11] him because he he sinned by bringing a
[2:23:15] wrong Doctrine
[2:23:21] I
[2:23:22] see he that's why God took
[2:23:25] him in a car
[2:23:27] accident well before you talk about that
[2:23:31] can you talk about John the
[2:23:33] Baptist Hallelujah glory to God Amen how
[2:23:38] didn the
[2:23:40] Baptist John the Baptist his head was
[2:23:43] cut
[2:23:45] off Hallelujah
[2:23:47] [Applause]
[2:23:50] his head was cut
[2:23:51] off they cut off his
[2:23:54] head and they put it on a
[2:23:57] platter yet he was the elij of that
[2:24:04] time all rightall and then he said
[2:24:08] because he was preaching
[2:24:10] wrong what is wrong doctr he began
[2:24:13] talking about the serpent
[2:24:16] seat
[2:24:20] I can preach the serpent seed without
[2:24:21] even mentioning the
[2:24:26] name John preaches serpent
[2:24:30] seed Paul preached serpent
[2:24:34] seed we know from the
[2:24:38] Bible that Kan was not a son of
[2:24:42] Adam I want Apostle
[2:24:45] Grace I can go to him
[2:24:47] by to prove to
[2:24:50] me from the Bible that was a son
[2:24:55] of
[2:24:57] nowhere nowhere in the genealogies of
[2:25:02] Adam nowhere the Bible says Enoch was
[2:25:05] the seventh from
[2:25:08] Adam and you've not counted
[2:25:11] Cain youve not
[2:25:14] counted the Bible says
[2:25:17] sa repl
[2:25:19] AB so you begin
[2:25:22] counting from Adam
[2:25:24] to Kan was not
[2:25:27] counted why because the Bible says in
[2:25:32] the book of First
[2:25:33] John was a son of
[2:25:37] sat hallu write in your
[2:25:40] Bible they are
[2:25:42] blinded and by missing the ministry of
[2:25:45] Elijah
[2:25:47] they will miss the
[2:25:50] Rapture why because they can't
[2:25:53] understand the Min of Elijah in the end
[2:25:57] time is coming to prepare the bride for
[2:26:00] the
[2:26:03] Rapture it is coming to introduce the
[2:26:07] bride to the
[2:26:09] bridegroom Jesus
[2:26:11] Christ this ain't about
[2:26:14] church this is not about our
[2:26:18] our pastor that's why a true message
[2:26:22] church does not lift up a
[2:26:25] pastor the
[2:26:27] word our pastor is the Bible and the
[2:26:31] Holy
[2:26:32] Ghost and any man will stand behind the
[2:26:36] Bible and the word that one we will
[2:26:40] follow Paul said follow me as I follow
[2:26:44] Christ we are not here to follow
[2:26:48] even to follow
[2:26:49] William if William preaches anything
[2:26:54] that is not in the Bible we shall not
[2:26:57] believe
[2:26:58] it but I want to tell you until today I
[2:27:02] have not seen any
[2:27:04] doctr of William BR that is not in the
[2:27:09] Bible it is right here in the Bible
[2:27:14] every man of God every servant
[2:27:17] for him to prove that is of god he
[2:27:21] cannot teach something different
[2:27:24] from the Bible is our
[2:27:27] ABS hallelujah hallelujah praise God I
[2:27:32] say El
[2:27:33] is El
[2:27:35] is the devil can't
[2:27:38] stop they are too
[2:27:40] late to stop it they waited until
[2:27:45] William Bram died
[2:27:48] and then they began
[2:27:51] saying some people
[2:27:54] prophesied some prophesy a prophecy
[2:27:57] doesn't come after it has
[2:28:01] happened I wish this people would do
[2:28:03] some
[2:28:04] research no man would
[2:28:08] dare give such
[2:28:11] prophecies when he was the man was
[2:28:15] alive
[2:28:17] praise
[2:28:19] God what William Bram
[2:28:23] had was not a gift
[2:28:26] only it was a
[2:28:31] Ministry Elijah didn't have just a
[2:28:34] gift he had a
[2:28:39] Min are you following me the word of God
[2:28:42] doesn't come to an
[2:28:45] apostle
[2:28:48] it comes to a
[2:28:50] prophet that is the way read Amos
[2:28:55] 3:17 says surely the Lord God will do
[2:29:00] nothing but he will reveal his secrets
[2:29:02] to his servants the
[2:29:06] prophets and I'm I am
[2:29:09] happy I can identify
[2:29:11] myself with theer Ministry in our
[2:29:15] en there are many prophets in the Old
[2:29:19] Testament the spirit and the Min of elah
[2:29:21] were was however very
[2:29:26] special it was very
[2:29:28] special elah came in at the time when
[2:29:31] Israel was
[2:29:34] back the glory of God had
[2:29:38] departed I believe you can
[2:29:42] say that the glory of
[2:29:45] God departed from the religious
[2:29:52] World they Bast of
[2:29:56] success how many people they
[2:29:59] have and how good the buildings
[2:30:03] are which is okay but that's not a
[2:30:07] measure of level of
[2:30:10] success a measure of success true me of
[2:30:15] success
[2:30:17] is when how many people you've brought
[2:30:19] to
[2:30:20] Christ not to your
[2:30:22] denomination but to
[2:30:25] Christ not to your
[2:30:27] church but you've brought them to know
[2:30:30] Christ that's how you measure your
[2:30:32] success
[2:30:38] Min even if I
[2:30:40] preached
[2:30:43] 2s and one got saved
[2:30:47] I would consider myself as a successful
[2:30:52] preacher if our church here our
[2:30:55] fellowship
[2:30:57] here if only two can go in the
[2:31:02] Rapture one I will consider myself as
[2:31:06] having a successful
[2:31:10] Min if only one or
[2:31:13] two receive the Holy Ghost sincerely in
[2:31:17] their souls and walk the Life of
[2:31:20] Christ and walk the
[2:31:24] talk then we have a
[2:31:28] successful but at that time Israel had
[2:31:32] Backle the glory of
[2:31:37] God and
[2:31:39] King was one of the
[2:31:42] problems he had mared from among the
[2:31:44] Heen women
[2:31:47] that's why a Believer should never Mar
[2:31:52] unbeliever I Married An
[2:31:56] unbeliever she brought an
[2:31:59] unbeliever and when that
[2:32:01] happened jeel the
[2:32:04] woman she
[2:32:07] misled and they
[2:32:10] builts which were not the Alters of
[2:32:12] Jehovah
[2:32:13] God but they were Alters of other
[2:32:20] and Jezebel
[2:32:23] died
[2:32:25] died Elijah was there but these
[2:32:29] people the spirits of them that were on
[2:32:33] them is here
[2:32:37] again the spirit of Ahab is
[2:32:41] here in the
[2:32:43] denominations that don't accept the
[2:32:45] right teachings of
[2:32:50] toled Jezebel the spirit of
[2:32:53] jeel the spirit of Jezebel the woman
[2:32:56] Spirit which the chch
[2:32:58] spirit a woman is a type of a
[2:33:02] church Spirit which will pull
[2:33:06] them away from the word my pastor said
[2:33:11] it doesn't matter how I dress sister it
[2:33:14] matters how you dress
[2:33:16] [Applause]
[2:33:18] it matters how you
[2:33:21] dress it is woman this woman
[2:33:25] je how that she was painting
[2:33:31] herself and we see the Same Spirit
[2:33:35] today women are on the
[2:33:37] pulpits and they like
[2:33:41] jeel to begin with it was not the place
[2:33:45] of jeze
[2:33:48] to be a preacher in
[2:33:51] Israel God had not called a woman
[2:33:55] Prophet to be a preacher in
[2:33:59] Israel there where Prophet
[2:34:02] says like Prophet
[2:34:05] doas Prophet doas was not going around
[2:34:09] in the
[2:34:10] temple teaching
[2:34:12] prophets instructing
[2:34:15] Kings
[2:34:17] Prophet
[2:34:18] doas she would sit at her
[2:34:22] home under a pal
[2:34:25] tree and anybody who wanted to inquire
[2:34:27] of the
[2:34:29] Lord would go to her
[2:34:31] home but the prophetes so of
[2:34:36] today are not prophetes like
[2:34:40] doers they are not Servants of God like
[2:34:44] prisilla
[2:34:46] but we see the spirit of Jezebel behind
[2:34:51] him Jezebel who was instructing the
[2:34:55] king intoxicating the
[2:34:58] king and the King believed wrong
[2:35:03] Doctrine Jezebel made herself a
[2:35:08] pastor of Israel even when there was a
[2:35:12] true prophet of
[2:35:15] God true prophet of God called
[2:35:21] Elijah
[2:35:24] overed because she had the influence of
[2:35:26] the
[2:35:28] king and she was so big and this woman
[2:35:32] would paint
[2:35:35] us and go to the
[2:35:37] window and she wanted men to look at
[2:35:41] her sister if you tell me you are using
[2:35:45] me
[2:35:47] but your desire is not to be seen by
[2:35:52] men you are
[2:35:54] lying let me prove that to you do that
[2:35:58] makeup and remain in your
[2:36:05] bedroom you
[2:36:07] cannot because you want to do
[2:36:10] makeup so that you can attract those
[2:36:14] men you don't many women don't do it
[2:36:19] intentionally it is a spirit of the
[2:36:23] age of
[2:36:25] jeel and even the pastors they already
[2:36:30] Intoxicated by this
[2:36:32] Spirit they tell the young
[2:36:35] ladies please make
[2:36:38] up look
[2:36:40] beautiful look
[2:36:42] attractive so you can get me to marri
[2:36:46] I'm sorry the men that will marry you
[2:36:48] will be like I the
[2:36:54] brother but as far as I'm
[2:36:57] concerned Brothers Are Holy Ghost f are
[2:37:01] not going
[2:37:03] toel painted
[2:37:06] Jezebel and even Believers of the
[2:37:09] message who don't believe in
[2:37:11] makeup on the wedding day they make
[2:37:14] makeup
[2:37:17] oh my
[2:37:18] God
[2:37:21] is so on your wedding day you are saying
[2:37:25] it is my
[2:37:26] day I can carry some little
[2:37:30] Jezebel if it is not good for you

[2:40:31] Bible the B talks about
[2:40:34] Samson say Samson what was he
[2:40:40] Samson had a
[2:40:44] vow
[2:40:47] and that
[2:40:50] vow did not allow him to cut even to put
[2:40:52] a Las on
[2:40:57] his
[2:40:58] nothing because he had a vow with
[2:41:02] God and that's where the source of his
[2:41:04] power was
[2:41:05] coming in the New Testament the Bible
[2:41:08] says the
[2:41:09] woman they have power on their
[2:41:14] head
[2:41:16] for the reason of their long
[2:41:19] hair their uncut
[2:41:22] hair long I want to be
[2:41:25] long well not against your
[2:41:29] nature you not a white

[2:41:44] form keep it the way God would like you
[2:41:47] to keep yourself neat and
[2:41:50] nice look
[2:41:52] beautiful the way of the
[2:41:55] Believers when we preach these things it
[2:41:58] doesn't mean sister
[2:42:01] just I'm not going to come I'm not going
[2:42:05] to wash my
[2:42:06] hair I'm a believer I'm not even going
[2:42:09] to dress proper even the clo I dress
[2:42:13] sweeping the
[2:42:14] floor because I'm a Believer no don't
[2:42:18] overdo
[2:42:20] it do it the right
[2:42:22] way if you many of the people who do
[2:42:25] that they doing it as a
[2:42:28] law but do it by
[2:42:30] Revelation dress nice look nice if you
[2:42:34] don't if you dress
[2:42:44] badly
[2:42:46] you
[2:42:47] know if you are that kind of woman who
[2:42:53] always will not see
[2:42:58] you will be
[2:43:00] there why don't you
[2:43:02] marry I don't see
[2:43:05] Sisters yet they are here but they
[2:43:11] are they are not
[2:43:14] seeable
[2:43:20] sisters look
[2:43:22] nice but not
[2:43:28] sexy okay that kind of language appears
[2:43:31] to our younger
[2:43:34] generation you know these days they
[2:43:36] dress to
[2:43:38] impress they dress to be
[2:43:41] sex they not a sexual
[2:43:44] object
[2:43:48] you are as a daughter of
[2:43:50] God you are not to be looked at men to
[2:43:53] last after
[2:43:55] you let ay look at you and say I see the
[2:44:00] character
[2:44:02] of in this younger
[2:44:07] sister so much that he can't even
[2:44:14] sleep until he comes to the
[2:44:18] pastor when I looked at
[2:44:21] sister forunate
[2:44:24] forunate I can't even
[2:44:27] sleep help me
[2:44:30] Pastor what can I do because when I see
[2:44:34] her I see the character
[2:44:37] of the way she talks the way she beh the
[2:44:41] way she dresses the way she does a see
[2:44:45] Jesus
[2:44:46] Christ but if you want to be the
[2:44:49] kind that men look at
[2:44:52] you and they're
[2:44:59] like both of you have committed
[2:45:04] fornication and the Bible
[2:45:07] says
[2:45:12] already that was for free
[2:45:16] for our young
[2:45:18] people that woman
[2:45:21] Jezebel that woman
[2:45:24] jeze and in Revelation
[2:45:27] 2:20 not
[2:45:30] withstanding I have a few things against
[2:45:33] thee because thou suffer that woman
[2:45:36] Jezebel which call herself a prophetes
[2:45:38] to teach and to seduce my servants to
[2:45:41] commit fornication and to eat things
[2:45:43] sacrificed unto idols
[2:45:56] the spirit of
[2:45:57] Jezebel is a spirit of
[2:46:02] fornication and physically speaking most
[2:46:05] women are like this in
[2:46:08] generation the things they do it is for
[2:46:10] that
[2:46:12] purpose this is for our young people
[2:46:15] I'll give you this
[2:46:16] testimony one time ethopia you know I
[2:46:21] I've been raised to to leave the
[2:46:25] word I know there are certain things I
[2:46:28] can't
[2:46:29] do like you cannot find me in one room
[2:46:32] closed up with one
[2:46:36] sister I can't do that even if I'm a
[2:46:40] pastor I will keep that order I not do
[2:46:43] that oh you don't trust
[2:46:46] yourself well I don't trust the
[2:46:50] devil are you hearing me I don't trust
[2:46:53] the
[2:46:55] devil and here in
[2:46:58] Ethiopia I was in um you know this this
[2:47:03] sister that
[2:47:04] came she was a new
[2:47:06] believer but I noticed I was even
[2:47:08] speaking to my wife this
[2:47:09] sister she has a certain speed on her we
[2:47:13] need to pray for her and so one time she
[2:47:15] calls me up and you know she tried her
[2:47:18] best to meet me
[2:47:20] alone I was like what is going
[2:47:22] on so there must be
[2:47:25] something so I of course I was watching
[2:47:28] for
[2:47:29] that but not wanting to be
[2:47:32] rude and so what I did I was always
[2:47:35] keeping a
[2:47:37] distance and always meeting her with my
[2:47:39] wife close
[2:47:41] by she needed any
[2:47:43] c but you know she was a new believer
[2:47:47] and then one time she calls me up I
[2:47:50] don't remember what time it was it
[2:47:52] was uh maybe my wife can remember was it
[2:47:55] midnight or
[2:47:58] midnight after
[2:48:00] midnight after
[2:48:08] midnight
[2:48:11] [Music]
[2:48:12] condition so touching
[2:48:15] I feel this is real is genuine I need to
[2:48:19] go rescue
[2:48:21] her so I I called up a brother I had a
[2:48:25] brother in my
[2:48:26] house who is now the pastor of the
[2:48:30] church I called him up I said brotherus
[2:48:33] let's
[2:48:33] go could you please help me let's go and
[2:48:36] we meet this sister she just called me
[2:48:39] now she she's in distress
[2:48:42] help so we drove
[2:48:46] and then when we arrived
[2:48:48] there she came and you know found on on
[2:48:51] the
[2:48:53] road like
[2:48:55] jeel and then she sat in the
[2:48:58] chair in the front of the
[2:49:01] chair and when she
[2:49:03] sat she noticed there was brother
[2:49:08] morgus and she became very angry why did
[2:49:11] you come with
[2:49:12] him I had my problems I tell
[2:49:22] you I just kept
[2:49:24] quiet and I observed the
[2:49:27] situation and then she noticed I was
[2:49:31] just
[2:49:32] calm and it was just an
[2:49:35] embarrassment so she calmed down she
[2:49:38] started telling me issues it wasn't a
[2:49:41] great
[2:49:42] deal in 5 minutes we drove her back
[2:49:46] and went home now you who thinks you
[2:49:49] spiritual more than even your
[2:49:54] P you know may I can even you know share
[2:49:57] a room with a
[2:50:02] sister
[2:50:03] brother you are not more spiritual than
[2:50:06] the
[2:50:10] word the Bible says don't accompany with
[2:50:18] fornicators don't even eat with
[2:50:23] them are you hearing
[2:50:25] me but he said not all together the
[2:50:31] forat
[2:50:33] but those
[2:50:35] ones are called brother or
[2:50:40] sister and going around forting around
[2:50:45] those ones they should be
[2:50:47] marked unless they
[2:50:49] repent shouldn't fellowship with
[2:50:52] them it is scripture so brother there
[2:50:57] are certain
[2:50:58] sins which you can
[2:51:01] avoid and
[2:51:03] others you can't
[2:51:06] avoid for example you can't avoid
[2:51:10] fornication if you go the enem
[2:51:13] come
[2:51:16] a man of
[2:51:20] godon
[2:51:22] anointed having a heart like
[2:51:25] that but when he went into that
[2:51:29] camp when he saw the first
[2:51:32] time he looked
[2:51:33] away
[2:51:37] help said this is too
[2:51:39] much call
[2:51:42] me the next thing you realize
[2:51:45] he had fallen from
[2:51:47] gra talk about Samson a man of God
[2:51:51] power powerful he sits down and on on
[2:51:56] the sleeps on the laps
[2:51:59] of and you know begin while he was on
[2:52:04] the thighs
[2:52:07] of I'm powerful you know you know I'm
[2:52:11] anointed you know I can
[2:52:13] kill
[2:52:18] yes that's why I
[2:52:23] TR
[2:52:24] yes tell me where is
[2:52:28] your no I will not tell you so you don't
[2:52:33] love and in that process slowly by
[2:52:37] slowly Samson was losing his strength
[2:52:40] Samson was losing his
[2:52:42] strength his strength spiritual
[2:52:46] strength his
[2:52:47] secret our secret is
[2:52:51] the let people ask you what is your
[2:52:54] secret of
[2:52:56] Holiness what is your secret of
[2:52:58] strength our secret is the
[2:53:02] word because we are hiding ourselves in
[2:53:05] the
[2:53:06] word we have escaped
[2:53:10] fornication we have escaped both
[2:53:12] physical and
[2:53:13] spiritual
[2:53:15] hide yourself in the word yourself in
[2:53:18] the word Samson was on the of
[2:53:22] woman how could he
[2:53:26] escape before he knew it he was
[2:53:29] gone even powerful men they have all
[2:53:33] gone because
[2:53:34] of and here is the spirit of
[2:53:38] Jezebel again you know Ahab was a man
[2:53:43] that was supposed to be a man of God but
[2:53:46] when Jezebel came
[2:53:48] to Jezebel seduced him plant
[2:53:55] temples
[2:53:57] of and other
[2:53:59] gods and
[2:54:01] back brother sister the spirit of
[2:54:05] Jezebel is here in the end
[2:54:08] time it is with us but we can overcome
[2:54:12] it the only way to overcome the spirit
[2:54:15] of
[2:54:17] Jezebel is to accept the message of
[2:54:21] el are you hearing me this morning to
[2:54:24] accept the message of
[2:54:26] Elijah Elijah is in the L but the Bible
[2:54:29] here says that I have something against
[2:54:33] you because you suffer that woman
[2:54:38] Jezebel which calls herself a
[2:54:41] proph to teach and to s
[2:54:45] use my servants to commit
[2:54:48] forication oh my God the spirit of
[2:54:51] Jezebel it's a religious
[2:54:54] spirit which has seduced people away
[2:54:57] from the
[2:54:59] world brought them to
[2:55:01] febles ideas
[2:55:05] Idols I can preach from two more
[2:55:09] hours but I have to stop

[2:55:23] real but when Jezebel comes on the
