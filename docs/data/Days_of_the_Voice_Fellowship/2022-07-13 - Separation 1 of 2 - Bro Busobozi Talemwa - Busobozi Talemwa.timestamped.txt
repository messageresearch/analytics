[0:15] me now abraham believed naked
[0:18] and abraham tried to listen to separate
[0:21] himself
[0:25] remember i'm speaking on separation
[0:26] today
[0:30] he did separate himself really amazing
[0:33] because he separated himself from his
[0:35] mother his father
[0:39] his brothers again
[0:41] friends finally
[0:44] but there is this little cousin why
[0:46] would i watch his way
[0:48] that he loved where he
[0:51] is said no this one nagama katy oh no
[0:55] actually god should understand nemo
[0:58] like we should also have something that
[0:59] i love
[1:02] i will come with my cousin
[1:09] i am with him
[2:07] your choice is his choice
[2:14] and the day you learn to yield
[2:20] is the day you are going to see the
[2:21] blessing of god
[2:25] as you continue to yield your members as
[2:28] instruments of unrighteousness
[2:31] [Music]
[2:35] the more it will become hard for you
[2:40] so what do you choose
[2:44] i wish someone could tell abram
[2:47] abram live lord
[3:27] god does not manifest his love out of
[3:29] giving you good things or
[3:33] [Music]
[3:45] and he said so i hate it again
[3:53] what did he show
[3:54] you
[4:26] hallelujah but the day oh goodness that
[4:30] they decided to yield himself unto god
[4:36] that is the death failure
[4:39] that is the day his name
[5:07] and god said okay i'll be quiet
[5:11] silica do you think whatever interview
[5:14] and one day
[5:16] abraham came to himself
[5:19] i don't know how long it was maybe it
[5:20] was so long
[5:22] and then
[5:24] he told his brother hagam gandawe
[5:27] brother lord organ
[5:31] from today
[5:34] if you go east
[5:36] i go west
[6:45] hallelujah
[7:27] until i see it
[7:29] up to today
[7:33] those nations which were in those lands
[7:34] are still fighting
[7:39] but god still keeps his promise
[7:50] who has what god wants you to have
[8:06] hallelujah amen here was a man called
[8:09] soul
