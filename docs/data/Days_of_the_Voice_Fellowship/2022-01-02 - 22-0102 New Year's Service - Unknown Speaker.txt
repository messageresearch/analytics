========================================

sing a special song but maybe because of time maybe god willing next sunday praise god brethren yeah i'm also happy to stand before you uh this morning and i thank god for the battles we've gone through that past year it was quite a battle praise you to god i too have something somehow similar to the one of brother luanga because we came from the same fellowship and it was not easy you know one thing i know god speaks to an individual and when god speaks to your heart you will not need to convince the whole world that god spoke to me praise be to god i remember uh like two years back because for me to move this way i took something like one one year and i think some two months or three months because i was still waiting on god but finally when that time ripen i had to uh inform my former pastor that uh i think now is the time for me to move and friends it was quite an experience praise be to god when i left there when i talked to him he gave me his mind so uh it was now me to decide what to do but within when i was still at his place because i went i met him at his home and then he gave me his mind but when i was still there i believe god spoke to me i just had something reminding me about a scenario which happened in the message one day brother branham was going god was calling him to go somewhere for ministry and the mother-in-law refused told him that you cannot take my daughter to that trash praise be to god and somehow because brother paul would not want to hurt the mother in law he did not listen to the voice of god and what followed it almost took his life he lost his daughter wife and even himself almost when so when i was still there thinking about it that same thing spoke to me it was it was as strong just like the voice of somebody that remember brother branham and the in-law saga praise be to god so i went home and thought about it when i shared with my wife at first uh she did not swallow it because of her reasons praise be to god you know it's always not easy but uh i i personally god know my heart i and i believe i was sincere i'd not move this way because of other things but because i wanted to serve god you will ask me but not because i was not serving god there i was serving god but time came and uh i kind of was not fully in the service but now when this time this time around i just felt like it was now the right time for me to rise and do something for god so when i shared with my wife yeah she was 50 50. i left it on her but i trusted god and i kept praying for high in my heart knowing that one day god will speak to our heart praise be to god you know it's always not easy to leave the church where you have been for years you have friends and they also threaten you with what see when you go half brother your future is buried everything uh i mean they are attacks not from the pastor but the people think that they're helping pastor to find they're there to try to convince you but one thing i know a christian is supposed to follow the leadership of the holy spirit and to listen to the voice of god because when you don't listen the verse of gonna listen to the voice of men there is a weep but when that weep comes brother it it's always not easy praise be to god but i thank god that enabled me to move this way and for sure i'm happy i thank god for our pastor he's such a loving pastor and he's always attached to the flock you always want to know what's happening around each and every one of us and also i thank god for this ministry personally it has not i'm not the same that's what i can say i believe i'm moving somewhere i remember on 21st my wife made a statement and to say that when she was coming she didn't know that she would get the word which will really make her heart fully but now she thank god for me it was such a big testimony yeah because some people thought that this thing was not was there is no trust that you can give somebody trusting someone with your soul that he is capable to lead you with your family until eternity my friends that is one of the biggest trust you can put in somebody so you cannot just risk yourself and say let me go with this praise be to god because soul we only have one soul but i thank god that i'm fully convinced and persuaded that he will lead us through praise be to god because we have got the word we have also we tested him by the word and we don't have any doubt so i thank god he has fought for me battles last year there were many battles he escaped with my family also thank god for my wife i know you know sometime maybe somewhere some are things go wrong but i thank god that they have still kept us together and we are moving on for the better i thank god for each one of you you really have been so good to us you've been brothers mothers sisters to us and may god bless you and maybe where things went wrong here and there and you have it in your heart i'll just ask you to get a place in your heart forgive me because i've never have any intention of hurting anybody but it's my prayer that this year god gives us more grace and give us zeal at least this year by the end of this year let us pray god that we have testimonies of people being filled with the holy spirit praise be to god at least if all of us still we thank god may god bless you and i wish you a blessed sunday amen it's already half past eleven our business is your first time to fellowship with us i just request you to raise your hands yeah may god bless you so much thank you for coming if you don't mind just in one minute i request you to rise up then you introduce yourself where you came from how you came to know about us and god will bless you foreign foreign that's how we started communicating and me knowing you come here then that girl told me that is very good are you born again then i told her yes but i'm suffering i i want to go and pray but i don't know where to go then she told me tomorrow morning hallelujah amen she is there and yes sister daughter dear christians this year [Music] children of god the bible says two are better than one can two work together unless they agree so this year agreed to work with

catalan i am doing engineering um some i have a contract down there called i was just god was reminding me i brought something and i did not finish it in my testimony when i left there some thought that ah that is the end of us but i want to tell you ever since we left there god has been so gracious personally i do uh i do plumbing and also electronics work as well but mainly i'm like i'm measuring in plumbing and uh you know where you have been you have clients there and now it's uh but thanks be to god that god has given me uh clients this way and even those who were not even calling me and even talking to me nowadays we are friends they call me and they realize that uh because personally the bible tells us that we should win evil with the good i'd not show any bad heart or any bad words but i just prayed for them but one thing i thank god of that we are now friends and we are still tight bad days that we used to be god has been so good he has taken care of me with my family all of us we are happy i can say like brother you can look at them and uh israel doesn't look like them that is the grace of god and your prayers so friends the god we are serving is real and i believe we are moving from glory to glory so my friends when you are threatening that now if you go god is speaking to you and the man is also speaking to you but i want to tell that when you take the side of god god always stand by your side god bless you so much our precious brother you're most welcome this is days of the voice fellowship this is our fellowship our little flock where we are

have faithfully uh been with us and attended the fellowship and come and you know serve the lord with us uh we are believing that the lord is yet to do great things for us now i um i do appreciate brother ruanga who gave such a wonderful testimony and uh you know um i know his testimony was not recorded but it was recorded in heaven we want to say we appreciate you so much [Music] [Music] you see uh brother martin and sister winnie uh go back with me many years ago and uh we are all originally from one church mechanism of the types that always go hurting and haunting people when you find yourself trapped together in the same place it is very difficult to have that kind of mutual understanding in life why not begin it when you are purposed to be positive to others amen amen we also i also want to appreciate brother appear in his absence uh mature believers that we got to learn that live around here and of course they had their church where they were attending uh you know they've been so supportive they've been so supportive uh uh how many have been where is sister sister here you are in the village i say some are not yet back wife okay he's his wife you understand he's trapped at work with the lord there now you are waiting i know brother peter you might actually be streaming organ some of these people that i've mentioned apart from sister grace were directed here by brother pill [Music] and uh so they themselves have been attending you know i think we i think we hijacked most of their family members and uh by design by design they are becoming a part of us sister i think i i don't know i think i've not missed anybody where's father 54. over here uh yeah so these young men and ladies have become a part of us [Music] none of us three years ago saw ourselves but you see the lord knew it and he had already the purpose to be that way to take we are take a take and so you feel settled in your heart knowing this one thing that has led you this far will help you finish the journey our friend our brother who is visiting from sorotic i heard that you are a bible uh college teacher or something like a bible [Music] [Music] which means you're one of the main theological or theology teachers in that college so i want to give you a gift which will help you so much it will it will not make will she take it change your perspective on the future but it will be a blessing to you i believe the only thing you have to do is to read it this is a book table written many years ago in the 1940s and this title is this an exposition of the seven church ages a hundred percent bible best is uh we i know that some people should be outside if you can come even if you come in the doorway no problem so i can't be able to see you my new area make them sit where i can see them forever amen i mean praise the lord we had a wonderful new year's eve is it a new as evil or watch night service those who missed it i posted a few clips and pictures on there on the church group what's up last one you know [Music] but of course much of it was enjoyed by those who came naive thank you for coming we also had a wonderful service in kaimusi meetings and this morning i'm going to speak a subject on what i spoke about in one of those meetings because i believe it's a great a great way to start the year come on [Music] i would like to give also a financial report for the past year business expect you to stay back we'll just have maybe 30 minutes or so of going through those numbers to definitely 100 million it doesn't matter we must be accountable and since you gave iran you we have to be accountable not only to god but also to you know embarrass you that's what we believe where did your kid is sister esther can you stand up man this is uh you remember the little girl i told you that collected and broke her books to be able to contribute the first money we had for the church and uh but she has always called me daddy inside of anko she stayed with me from when she was a little girl [Music] i hope we have never really bought ourselves in any service amen hallelujah hallelujah so i'll speak for one hour you the lord willing just pray for me so whatever you're doing what do you do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him so if you want to do something but you feel you cannot do it in the name of jesus then don't do it don't do it i understand there's a sister here that wants to be baptized [Music] [Applause] so this morning i'm speaking about being a servant so to you wives is your new year's message now when it gets to some of these summons people get quiet please you are my church here don't get quiet on me i'm preaching this outside they can get quiet but here say amen to them amen they are not submitting yourself to your husband become fit to the lord you know that if you submit yourself to your husband it becomes fit in the lord power submit yourself to your husband if he buys for you street or candies for you to your husband when he does only good things and no bad thing at all the bible here the church and christ because christ is the husband of the church the church is the wife so we all are the wife of jesus do you know we are the church of jesus christ and we are called the wife the bride can you say yes the bible in the book of revelation says that the and why do we come to church like this we make ourselves ready for the marriage of the lamb then he says amen [Music] that love made him a lamp what does the lamp do is sacrifice meaning you can love your wife so much [Applause] you know jesus christ yes christians foreign children obey your parents in all things i will tell you this before a child marries or gets married have given them permission that is a god given right to parents that's why if a parent doesn't take care of their children even the the father but i'm [Music] says in all things moving to beyond now what does it mean it means those children who are once under their parents time will so he says if children obey their parents some words and some things [Music] you know like in many cultures when a father is beating her or splitting a child obviously everyone is a servant in one way or the other moon should really be a servant it says that servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh you have people who are believers they do not want to obey their side their master [Music] foreign a servant now it used to be that you see that when a woman got married she would pick a few girls or one girl whichever it is that she wanted to be if a man could not have a child with his wife that the wife could would go to the servant suggestion and so then as it was done in many places in the bible where there come a bible [Music] so that my husband can give me children can you imagine this is how it used to be in the bible bible and so so it happened also with with abraham submissive to sarah in all things everything why did it what did she say simply nothing all about the weight would be done ingredients all the three were present and then the woman the servant would receive seed cutting on her furnace on behalf of the my servant is not obeying me he's looking at me that way and then abraham said blaming her and here is how the real men are supposed to do in [Music] please pack up your things go go go because you allowed us and she left now again with ishmael ishmael and the story continues on and on how [Music] um then she can walk they will have to figure it out in everything obey those who are your masters not only [Music] fast each of you are looking at me as servants yourself somewhere oh tonight your way who brothers brothers solomon are you the one brother solomon you're the one supposed to help us for people who are sleeping around oh come on i don't want people sleeping around here because they're making others many times the problems we have at places of work is because people don't want to be servants this is one of the principles of prosperity on the first sunday of the of the year what did you expect me to preach get your money financially bizarre [Music] this is how it is in the world and then they go to blackbody corruption because they are not good servants whether you are a teacher [Applause] [Applause] all of you are serving my name not only with external services as those who merely please people i'm reading a scripture here but with the sincerity of her [Music] did you know if you do not serve your masters well you are not serving or pleasing the lord over money [Applause] whenever you serve well today people are chasing after blessings cheers [Music] [Music] your job is not from a man it is from oh my god can you believe this that your job is not from amanda's from oh my god very much we work because we want where we can begin from because for us we cannot manage welcome for that they will ask you what do you have for about the teacher you know we can just walk because to get the beginning to talk with our friends okay okay he says we work to get a beginning i gotta be a true caller to finance andy quack and that is true yeah but i need someone else yes there is a little sister behind what woman enough why do we work give her the microphone let us tell us why she works i don't know whether she sister watch to call god and ours and our all leaders okay all right god bless you again uh for me the reason is we work to fulfill the will of god okay [Music] is collaborate with sin don't work for a reward to call that full name peter even the more money that i give you the more you will commit your time actually god come up from the senate if they are giving you two thousand killings because of your all right real life now so while we are starting this year about real life if someone is going to employ you for money or more [Music] they expect you know for you to put in your very best asu foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] your did he say huh 700 yeah the saturday is finished oh masala the salad is finished [Applause] so you got a reward for your masala but sorrow as the bible one you get a lot of confusions i'm sorry if your mom fed you only for two months but that's true then after that marriage children suck while this was suckling mommy [Music] you [Applause] come and actually said the lord christ jesus christ yes christian be your lord your joke will come out your employer your joke which means they will be the one to reward you of heaven you know that's one of the jobs that people look down on you see both the employers and the employees look at taking a negative attitude but it is not supposed to be that way not cheating about you you find the employer oh my gosh i will treat this lady or girl or boys sometimes it is a boy they will treat them so negatively amen you see then you know the the employers have that attitude you know this is the servant it's not to be treated like a child like a servant she has to feel it i need to cheat together you know you can suffer and feel everything it's as if but it is like a donkey even the children in the home even when they have grown never they cannot [Music] they get and you see when i was this is what i used to do to test one of the things i used to not the only thing but one of the things i used to do to test a good wife okay okay all right [Music] tongue you see but we call it mother tongue because the characters from the mother not from the father [Applause] of life of everything you come from the mountains then here you see that also many of these little girls my little sister no sister so you find them no matter wanting to be the ones to control the hope can you imagine i have had confidence everywhere she does this oh goodness um who and this little hacker becomes thank [Music] if if you master sister you see him come out but it is the lord who is your master therefore you will serve with fear please the lord [Music] um okay for men the bad thing it is that you could make every charm and remain with the good ones by the way if you do anything knowing that you're doing it for the lord you are not always under stress you know how much if if christ died for me christian i am feeling how much should i do to please him he's in collection if mommy tells only me only me to wash your tensioners only me [Music] service people are saying now if he has roasted us like that just on the opening scripture how much more then i'm saying don't worry i'm about to finish i'll finish the rest later and then who does wrong will be punished for his wrongdoing and with god there is no partiality no special treatment based on a person's position in life brother brothers this is praise the name of the lord here if you are going to be a servant this year oh my goodness i'll bring your servant oh where is your daughter i'm going to see the blessing of the lord this year i am not gambling [Music] hallelujah amen and i think i'll have to continue with this uh even maybe on next sunday let me push for about 10 minutes praise the lord come here in the message elijah the prophet says we see when men fail to serve god what happened we see men who stood out like real soldiers and served god whether you serve god or not it is a choice oh um is that will well be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the world and doctrine for the scripture sayeth thou shalt not muzzle the ox that tradeth out the corn and the laborer [Music] do you understand what do you expect mr henry in chagewa yes so i'm glad you know she just knew she didn't even believe the message but she's hearing about being a servant i have a democracy henry i was saying that this is also your message [Music] give [Applause] uh i don't want to go in the details but you heard their testimony of jesus i want to say this church whatever we do to serve the lord awareness i was just me and my wife elizabeth was not

covers their sins mighty man of allah or himself i can see never this is happening to you you know you know that it's good i see a blessing of god on youtube so it becomes that [Music] amen because we are being so that when you go out there we are doing oh my name is just know you're serving god my name is where is that one and i will read one last one and i promise i'll stop that because there's much to talk about i'll do i'll deal with it in the next service thou shalt thou shalt no shalt not oppress unhired servant that is poor and needy whether he be of thy brethren all of these strangers that are in their land with that within their gates at his day thou shalt give him his hire neither shall the sun go down upon it for he is poor and settled set his heart upon it lest he cry against
