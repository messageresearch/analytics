[16:40] versus part two is what I'm talking
[16:42] about today
[16:44] is
[17:07] 2 Corinthians 4 6.
[17:09] for God who commanded the light to shine
[17:12] out of Darkness has shined in our hearts
[17:15] to give the light of the knowledge of
[17:17] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[17:19] Christ
[17:29] [Music]
[17:33] but we have this treasure in art and
[17:36] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[17:39] may be of God and not of us
[17:52] we are troubled on every side yet not
[17:56] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[18:00] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[18:04] down but not destroyed
[18:06] is
[18:15] foreign
[18:33] I would like to announce to you before I
[18:35] forget that uh
[18:37] next Sunday the Lord willing I'll be
[18:40] ministering at evening
[18:43] light right Tabernacle yeah
[18:54] spoke to past Pastor Brother Joseph and
[18:57] I get economics and he asked us to come
[19:01] and speak for them
[19:04] I've spoken to them before
[19:08] Zoom several times
[19:10] but I think we'll this will be our first
[19:13] time to visit them physically
[19:17] and so their services are usually early
[19:20] in the morning
[19:23] because they told me from nine to around
[19:26] 10 30.
[19:29] so that means I can finish with their
[19:32] pulpit and come back on my board
[19:36] amen I mean so I'll go with a few
[19:39] brothers
[19:41] that uh when I call your name please I
[19:45] have a reason for whoever I will check
[19:47] so when I call your name don't refuse it
[19:49] in Japanese
[19:55] I mean praise the name of the Lord and
[19:57] so then after that we also are preparing
[20:01] to receive uh Pastor Moses
[20:09] is also nailed in the country
[20:14] on the next month on the 13th son um

[20:30] I'll give more details as the days
[20:36] praise the Lord
[21:38] spoke a wonderful full message to us
[21:42] and he actually came and he helped me
[21:47] because this was the some subject I had
[21:50] started on
[21:52] I don't even need to go deep anymore
[21:55] I only need to continue with his with
[21:58] inspiration
[22:00] I spoke on Treasure vessels
[22:10] the same scripture we are taking again
[22:12] but today we will go a little deeper
[22:15] into other scriptures
[22:22] for God has commanded the light to shine
[22:25] out of Darkness
[22:30] that same God who commanded the light to
[22:33] shine out of darkness and he said let
[22:35] there be light he has shined in our
[22:37] hearts
[22:43] we are trying to give the light of the
[22:46] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[22:48] face of Jesus Christ
[22:54] and then he says but we have this
[22:56] treasure in African vessels
[23:11] when I was beginning I asked you a
[23:13] question and said if you have your
[23:16] treasurement
[23:19] where would you rather keep it what the
[23:22] one this is
[23:30] something that is precious to you
[23:34] why would you rather keep it
[23:36] in a metallic uh uh something or in a
[23:41] picture
[23:48] come on now
[23:49] [Music]
[23:51] you put it in the metal hey
[23:56] and hide it away
[23:59] from prying eyes
[24:04] you know we have things we call safe we
[24:08] truly name into editorial treats and
[24:11] almost in every home or at least the
[24:14] middle income Anna's arms they have
[24:16] safes
[24:21] in the safe safe there is a lot of uh
[24:26] things that you you you you uh presume
[24:30] are precious to you
[24:33] and you keep it in a safe
[24:37] but you see God is so amazing
[24:40] but it's not like us who keep things in
[24:43] a safe
[24:46] who keep things
[24:51] foreign
[25:40] [Music]
[26:27] you even reach somewhere a sport where
[26:30] nobody's seeing you
[27:30] yeah foreign
[28:28] oh my goodness I mean and he says we
[28:31] have this treasurements
[28:46] and Pastor Stephen spoke to us and he
[28:48] said the gospel is
[29:00] the life
[29:02] and
[29:04] also the light is the word
[29:08] Christ wants to take that light like he
[29:11] said let there be light again
[30:12] the gospel is let there be light energy
[30:47] and you know sometimes when we are in
[30:50] church we want to feel and we want to be
[30:52] made we want to somebody to make us feel
[30:55] like as if we are perfect and holy oh

[33:53] foreign
[34:25] there was Delight the Bible says that
[34:28] the Earth was covered
[34:31] with Darkness
[34:33] but God simply spoke right yeah
[34:42] hallelujah amen he created light out of
[34:46] that yeah

[58:37] that the media Knights came out at the
[58:40] annual height of the children of Israel
[58:42] sorry that the children of the East even
[58:44] they came up against them and they had
[58:47] come against them and destroyed the
[58:50] increase from God till now come and
[58:53] bless them and let the dogs
[59:00] foreign
[59:12] and Israel was already impoverished
[59:15] because of the leader
[59:17] and the children of Israel cried under
[59:19] the law
[59:21] each other
[59:31] [Music]
[59:38] um
[59:49] [Music]
[1:00:30] foreign
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:01:01] Jesus
[1:01:45] foreign
[1:02:14] amazing

[1:02:43] stop today
[1:02:52] um
[1:03:34] thank you
[1:04:06] says
[1:05:03] the Lord
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:41] thank you
[1:05:45] one time
[1:06:08] what's up
[1:06:10] if he married a chorus
[1:06:16] you know like that right now that's
[1:06:20] called a powerful man of God
[1:06:24] but if he married a pain that face
[1:06:33] because the woman is the character of
[1:06:36] the man
[1:06:39] the woman is the manifestation of the
[1:06:43] character of the man or mukes
[1:06:47] that's why Jesus says he is not going to
[1:06:51] marry a prostitute yes
[1:06:55] he is not going to marry I am a woman
[1:06:58] again
[1:06:59] do you know the kind of woman Jesus is
[1:07:01] going to marry
[1:07:03] oh hallelujah amen he is going to marry
[1:07:07] a virtuous
[1:07:10] he's not even going to marry one who has
[1:07:13] Community fornication again
[1:07:15] foreign
[1:08:35] his word
[1:08:38] the woman shot the character of the
[1:08:40] nation again
[1:08:42] if you want to if you go into a new
[1:08:44] country
[1:08:45] and you want to know that spiritual
[1:08:48] status
[1:08:54] I remember when I landed in a
[1:08:57] when I came out of the aircraft
[1:09:02] it was fair because there were many
[1:09:04] Africans in there maybe Industries
[1:09:08] and people were pretty dressed up and
[1:09:11] covered
[1:09:12] so as I'm telling you the truth
[1:09:17] airport
[1:09:19] and I I stepped my first foot outside
[1:09:23] on the streets
[1:09:27] I almost covered my eyes
[1:09:32] because I was feeling that
[1:09:35] you know here in Africa we still have a
[1:09:38] lot of distance
[1:09:40] but many countries
[1:09:45] yeah you you host Brethren from from
[1:09:47] Europe or from America and they will see
[1:09:49] someone dressing a Scott or or address
[1:09:51] and they will ask you is that a Believer
[1:09:55] here we host Believers from Europe we
[1:09:57] want to teachers
[1:09:59] and when they see someone walking on the
[1:10:02] streets with a dress yeah
[1:10:18] but she's not even a believer
[1:10:21] but here we still have some distance
[1:10:25] that's why our presidents have refused
[1:10:27] some things
[1:10:29] not only in Uganda but also most African
[1:10:32] countries
[1:10:37] why why because we still have some
[1:10:39] businesses
[1:10:45] here we now see that when I reach there
[1:10:50] when natoka I almost covered my heart
[1:10:53] and for a while I was walking down
[1:10:58] my brother asked me
[1:11:02] bikini
[1:11:20] well maybe because it was hot yesterday
[1:11:28] foreign
[1:11:35] because
[1:12:32] you see honey
[1:12:36] and I was saying nothing that you will
[1:12:39] know the character or germanium Pizza of
[1:12:41] the church he is a canister by the women
[1:12:49] and I can as much I can talk about that
[1:12:51] but let me keep with the thoughts
[1:12:54] and so it was when Israel had sown you
[1:12:58] know the their sin so far away from God
[1:13:00] that is
[1:13:10] and because of that already God said
[1:13:15] let the medianized
[1:13:19] whatever they would saw
[1:13:23] the midianites would wait
[1:13:36] send a message yeah
[1:13:44] foreign
[1:14:16] they were good for nothing
[1:14:20] let us read seven to nine customers
[1:14:23] and it came to pass when the children of
[1:14:25] Israel Cried unto the Lord because of
[1:14:27] the midianites that the Lord sent a
[1:14:29] prophet unto the children of Israel
[1:14:30] which said unto them thus say the Lord
[1:14:32] God of Israel I brought you out up from
[1:14:34] Egypt and brought you forth out of the
[1:14:37] house of bondage and I delivered you out
[1:14:39] of the hand of the Egyptians and out of
[1:14:40] the hand of all that are pressed you and
[1:14:42] drove them out from before you and gave
[1:14:45] you their land and verse 10 and I said
[1:14:47] unto you I I am the Lord your God fear
[1:14:51] not the gods of the amorites in whose
[1:14:52] land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my
[1:14:54] voice
[1:15:41] this prophecy was not new it was a
[1:15:44] prophecy that was already given in the
[1:15:45] past time in the past but I did not hear
[1:15:48] Bruno Mars
[1:15:52] but you see two things I want you to see
[1:15:54] here whenever the children of God cries
[1:15:56] to the Lord foreign
[1:16:10] [Applause]
[1:16:25] and he keeps speaking to us
[1:16:35] God is a living God
[1:16:39] we cannot say he sent prophet
[1:16:44] and he sent us a prophet full stop
[1:16:50] if God stopped working with brother
[1:16:52] William Branham
[1:16:55] no longer living
[1:17:00] but the Bible tells me
[1:17:02] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday

[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:01] foreign

[1:43:39] preachers going to come out of here
[1:43:42] and some of you who feel that you can
[1:43:44] never even amount to anything some of

[1:45:24] why this this is
[1:45:33] our fathers told us
[1:45:42] did not the Lord bring us out of from
[1:45:45] Egypt
[1:45:46] City but now the brothers for seconds
[1:45:50] and they delivered us into the hands of
[1:45:53] the media
[1:45:54] and this boy knew his God
[1:46:00] but he was saying something is missing
[1:46:04] the secret I want to give you
[1:46:06] before God comes to you
[1:46:09] and now some of you are going to receive
[1:46:11] a reason to why God chose you
[1:46:13] know if God comes to you is because you
[1:46:18] always desired him
[1:46:25] for his presence
[1:46:36] and was seeking for something great
[1:46:41] it could be a solution
[1:46:44] but you do not know how to do it
[1:46:49] yeah
[1:46:53] disappointed
[1:46:55] and so when the angel come and speak to
[1:46:57] you
[1:46:59] Hallelujah yeah amen you don't say this
[1:47:02] don't be with us

[1:49:19] said now I will go a little deeper for
[1:49:21] you

[1:49:26] and you'll see how God demonstrated to
[1:49:28] Gideon that he is just a picture yes

[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:40] and
[2:00:42] it took everybody out of the spirit
[2:00:46] but here's what I love about the
[2:00:48] messages
[2:00:50] that we are not our churches are not run
[2:00:53] by program a mechanism
[2:00:59] Canada
[2:01:15] said everything is
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:33] that they have replaced the spirit of
[2:01:36] the leadership of the spirit of God
[2:01:47] in there he says
[2:01:49] let's sing one or two songs
[2:02:04] you don't even remember
[2:02:06] according to that program you're out of
[2:02:09] order context
[2:02:17] you understand
[2:02:20] it's not programs
[2:02:32] how can he preach foreign
[2:02:38] foreign
[2:03:17] [Music]
[2:03:37] Hallelujah
[2:03:41] let me finish this other course as I
[2:03:43] promised you he says it says
[2:03:45] these study says they don't believe in
[2:03:47] the Holocaust to be that leading the
[2:03:48] governing the church
[2:03:52] they don't believe in miracles
[2:03:54] they don't believe in science they don't
[2:03:58] believe in the Supernatural I just can't
[2:04:00] believe it now that spirit is not
[2:04:03] nothing new
[2:04:07] they don't believe in the living in the
[2:04:09] Miracles
[2:04:11] they don't believe in speaking in time
[2:04:14] if the brother brother can you play for
[2:04:17] me a very good worshiping
[2:04:28] the fly
[2:04:32] [Music]
[2:04:34] and everybody's worshiping everybody
[2:04:50] [Music]
[2:04:55] so while we are worshiping someone
[2:04:57] bursts out in town tonight
[2:05:01] the person with the microphone
[2:05:03] also increases
[2:05:13] if the Holy Spirit has shifted
[2:05:17] from the from the song leader or
[2:05:20] whatever it is
[2:05:27] then how you ought to pause
[2:05:34] and listen to what the spirit is
[2:05:37] that right
[2:05:40] and the brother who is playing that's
[2:05:43] why the people who were playing these
[2:05:44] instruments must be holy ghost films
[2:05:48] by the way you Brothers if you don't
[2:05:50] have the Holy Ghost you must
[2:05:55] seeking to you and you're also speaking
[2:05:57] to somebody else
[2:05:59] if you don't have the Holy Ghost you
[2:06:01] must seek
[2:06:03] you cannot be playing instruments
[2:06:09] I'm sorry so anyway this is
[2:06:12] because without it
[2:06:15] the very thing we are trying to do
[2:06:18] together it's not me speaking
[2:06:23] because if this brother is not in the
[2:06:25] spirit
[2:06:28] he will not sense what God is doing here
[2:06:33] you understand maybe there's somebody
[2:06:35] suffering and God wanted to tell them
[2:06:37] something and he's going to take them
[2:06:38] out of their troubles
[2:06:48] and this one it must all be connected
[2:06:53] do you understand that's the Holy Ghost
[2:06:56] taking control of the services
[2:07:02] [Music]
[2:07:24] the greatest
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:31] let's see
[2:07:37] oh he
[2:07:40] and as he was singing
[2:07:45] she wasn't playing as this brother's
[2:07:48] playing
[2:07:50] and I'm not saying it's not it's not in
[2:07:52] the spirit the sister was in the spirit
[2:07:55] and she was playing
[2:07:59] and playing now the eyes were even
[2:08:01] closed
[2:08:03] brother sister if you can't play when
[2:08:05] your eyes are closed and you're
[2:08:07] worshiping you are not playing you are
[2:08:08] just twisting God
[2:08:13] you must be in the spirit
[2:08:16] whatever we do we must be in the spirit
[2:08:22] because we believe in miracles we're
[2:08:24] having the power of God
[2:08:27] if I can't preach in the spirit then I
[2:08:29] shouldn't preach
[2:08:32] and the sister was playing
[2:08:35] according to us because it's free she
[2:08:37] went out of water but yeah
[2:08:43] because she went in the spirit
[2:08:46] she played and played them
[2:08:49] and she played that way
[2:09:00] guess what the piano continued
[2:09:17] hallelujah
[2:09:19] hallelujah
[2:09:20] we won't be honest
[2:09:29] we want you tourists
[2:09:36] who will not breathe who will let the
[2:09:40] holy ghosts
[2:09:46] that's what we need in our lives let me
[2:09:49] tell you if we don't have that probation
[2:09:52] we are dead and formal foreign
[2:10:17] thing the Pharisees don't believe
[2:10:20] they don't believe in a supernatural
[2:10:24] someone comes to sing a special song
[2:10:29] well of course it's his special song
[2:10:36] we don't want people to come here for a
[2:10:39] shower

[2:11:25] the only thing that can make a
[2:11:27] difference
[2:11:32] when the light comes in then you're
[2:11:35] going to sing a song
[2:11:40] your people are not going to say this is
[2:12:12] I'll praise the name of Allah
[2:12:16] and then these things it do you know if
[2:12:19] we take and heed them see you got to be
[2:12:21] quiet I need to be quiet God is

[2:13:14] man
[2:13:38] a little more
[2:13:42] me as a pastor or the brothers
[2:13:50] we should be sensitive to the spirit of
[2:13:52] God
[2:13:55] let the Holy Ghost finish
[2:13:58] his work that is
[2:14:06] and I wrap it up with this last report
