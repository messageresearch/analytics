[15:30] in those days was Hezekiah sick unto
[15:33] death and the prophet Isaiah the son of
[15:36] Amos came to him and said unto him thus
[15:39] saith the Lord set thy house in order
[15:41] for Thou shalt die and not leave then he
[15:45] turned his face to the wall and prayed
[15:47] unto the Lord saying I beseech thee O
[15:50] Lord remember now how I have walked
[15:52] before thee in truth and with a perfect
[15:54] heart and have done that which is good
[15:57] in thy sight and Hezekiah wept soul and
[16:00] it came to pass before Isaiah was gone
[16:02] out into the middle court that the word
[16:05] of the Lord came unto him saying turn
[16:07] again
[16:08] the captain of my people thus saith the
[16:12] Lord the god of David thy father I have
[16:14] heard thy prayer

[16:20] seen the tears behold I will heal thee
[16:23] on the third day Thou shalt go up into
[16:26] the house of the Lord and I will add
[16:29] unto thy days 15 years
[16:31] and I will deliver thee and this city
[16:34] out of the hand of the king of Assyria
[16:36] and I will defend this city of mine for
[16:39] my own sake and for my servant David is
[16:41] sick and Isaiah said take a lamp of figs

[18:35] thus saith the Lord the god of David thy
[18:39] father
[18:40] I have heard thy prayer
[18:47] I'm speaking to you on I have heard thy
[18:49] prayer is
[18:56] the name of the Lord
[19:00] our God is a faithful God
[19:03] if there is one thing you will
[19:07] foreign
[19:53] [Music]
[20:07] God must have felt a large of Faith
[20:15] you know if there is something God can't
[20:17] stand change
[20:29] to go away the prophet of God was
[20:33] the prophet was going out of the door
[20:36] Angel of the Lord
[20:46] I have heard thy prayer dance
[20:50] Papa
[21:04] oh hallelujah hallelujah when a child of
[21:07] God
[21:08] before the Lord
[21:10] he has your prayer right there
[21:17] and I know as Believers were so
[21:20] attending we go through a lot of
[21:21] suffering and afflictions
[21:24] part of our Christian Journey um
[21:33] sometimes you get desperate
[21:36] sometimes we are depressed
[21:38] and you see the devil's plan is to keep
[21:41] us focused on those things adults
[21:45] and we forget that God has equipped us
[21:48] always
[21:55] thank you
[21:58] as Believers they're attending we are
[22:00] not exempt from problems
[22:05] we are not sailing at this good thing we
[22:08] are sailing through sailing through
[22:10] family
[22:12] is a journey full of problems
[22:17] we are desperate
[22:22] times we are sick sometimes we need a
[22:25] job
[22:26] maybe sometimes you know we want God to
[22:29] do something in our homes
[22:32] and the devil wants us to be focused on
[22:35] those things
[22:53] the solution
[23:08] but the word and prayer will never face
[23:15] is also
[23:18] and the prophets the prophet says here
[23:20] in a message a second-handed rope um
[23:26] this morning that many are becoming
[23:28] discouraged
[23:32] what do you need brother is to take
[23:36] courage

[37:43] he found Daniel praying making his
[37:46] application before his God
[37:49] then they came near and speak before the
[37:52] king concerning the king's decree
[37:58] that every man that shall ask a petition
[38:01] of any God or any other man within 30
[38:03] days save the of thee or King shall be

[46:53] what is your 10 tonight
[46:59] maybe I've experienced it for years
[47:01] until
[47:05] uh
[47:09] until the devil told you that God will
[47:11] never answer your prayers news
[47:30] for he is right on time
[47:35] you know they waited for Jesus
[47:40] and Jesus was not coming is
[47:44] Jesus was not coming until the boy died
[47:53] four days later
[47:55] Jesus shows up
[47:58] you might think he is
[48:01] always right on time
[48:05] foreign
[48:37] I have heard thy prayer
[48:41] Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[48:52] when I hear it but it begins to
[48:56] foreign
[49:35] in the message believe in God
[49:38] therefore that's the reason
[49:42] the prayer of faith
[49:44] shall serve the sick
[49:47] and individual's prayer
[49:50] they fix your father in prayer of a
[49:55] righteousness
[50:07] with his name by being Christians
[50:12] most powerful weapon the world has ever
[50:16] known
[50:22] it even changes everything
[50:26] it will change the mind of God
[50:29] it did do it
[50:32] after death was pronounced
[50:47] I want to tell you also hold on foreign
[51:01] [Music]
[51:20] you will leave my sister
[51:22] you will not die
[51:28] my way
[51:32] and it says when God had already
[51:34] announced his death
[51:42] hallelujah hallelujah he said because
[51:44] that he prayed
[51:47] so if prayer is that powerful
[51:52] oh my we don't realize how good it is
[52:04] foreign
[52:31] let me show you something else that
[52:33] prayer does
[52:35] a man of God in the book of Acts give us
[52:38] Acts chapter 12 verse 5.
[52:42] Peter therefore was kept in prison
[52:45] but prayer was made without ceasing
[52:49] for him
[52:58] when their Pastor was in prison
[53:02] always pray for your pastor
[53:07] pray for the men and labor
[53:10] because the devil wants to put them in a
[53:12] prison
[53:14] instead of talking about them foreign
[53:39] [Music]
[53:47] foreign
[54:47] foreign
[55:00] my mind
