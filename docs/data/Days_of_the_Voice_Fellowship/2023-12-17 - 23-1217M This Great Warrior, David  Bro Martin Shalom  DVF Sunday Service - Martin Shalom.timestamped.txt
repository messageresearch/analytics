[1:34:09] say but the best way is to wait upon the
[1:34:16] Lord amen and this morning I'm going to
[1:34:20] uh to preach the message pre by the
[1:34:25] prophet he called it the great warrior
[1:34:31] David
[1:34:33] amen great warrior
[1:34:36] David is quite a wonderful
[1:34:41] sermon the Bible tells us to confort one
[1:34:44] another with these
[1:34:48] words and I know all of us know that we
[1:34:51] are in the
[1:34:54] battle we are fighting the Lord's
[1:34:57] battle in the battle we are
[1:35:00] fighting the victory is already
[1:35:07] attained amen there are many sermons
[1:35:11] which the prophet preach alongside that
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:15] line Talk of the Mighty the Great and
[1:35:18] Mighty
[1:35:20] conqueror
[1:35:22] the great warrior
[1:35:24] Joshua amen showing us how Jesus
[1:35:27] conquered
[1:35:30] Satan blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:35:33] and this morning we are going to look at
[1:35:35] the great warrior
[1:35:38] David anointed man in the hand of
[1:35:43] God praise the Lord remember this
[1:35:46] scripture where we have
[1:35:47] read for all you Bible
[1:35:50] readers that during the the time of
[1:35:55] Israelites when they on their way to the
[1:35:57] promised
[1:35:59] land there are series of things which
[1:36:01] happen alongside the
[1:36:05] way and remember when where God met
[1:36:09] Moses when we go back and we see the
[1:36:11] Promise God gave to
[1:36:14] Abraham how would bring his
[1:36:18] children out of
[1:36:20] Egypt take them to the promised
[1:36:23] land blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:36:26] that promise took so
[1:36:28] long and we know how Israel were in
[1:36:32] Egypt they were sold in
[1:36:35] slavery blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:36:39] and the Bible says one day God met
[1:36:42] Moses and told him I have heard the Cry
[1:36:46] of my
[1:36:50] children
[1:36:52] praise be to God this where they are
[1:36:54] always
[1:36:56] crying reading the word and they knew
[1:37:00] one
[1:37:01] day God would fulfill his
[1:37:04] promise when God prophesy
[1:37:08] something it cannot
[1:37:10] fail because the Bible says the word of
[1:37:14] God is a
[1:37:16] seed and when the seed is s in the
[1:37:19] ground just it the right
[1:37:24] atmosphere it must
[1:37:28] germinate amen so this
[1:37:31] morning just prepare your heart let your
[1:37:35] heart be the right
[1:37:37] ground for the seed the word of
[1:37:43] God
[1:37:44] Amen and remember alongside their
[1:37:49] way when they're moving on their
[1:37:52] way they reached
[1:37:54] somewhere and they converted the uh the
[1:37:58] foreign
[1:38:01] tribes because they had the
[1:38:04] Kings because their King they not seeing
[1:38:07] their
[1:38:08] King God was their
[1:38:11] King amen but when they were moving in
[1:38:15] their
[1:38:16] Journey they realized their opponent had
[1:38:20] Kings
[1:38:23] and you know how kings are
[1:38:26] treated you know how they are how their
[1:38:29] subjects goes and bore before
[1:38:33] them look at the Kingdom we having like
[1:38:35] the kingdom of
[1:38:39] buganda Amen when the king is going to
[1:38:42] visit a certain
[1:38:46] place they said the King has
[1:38:50] desired
[1:38:52] you don't call the
[1:38:55] king that have invited the king
[1:38:58] of that
[1:39:00] might to come and visit
[1:39:04] me it is his desire to come and visit me
[1:39:08] amen
[1:39:11] amen it is the king who desires to come
[1:39:14] and visit you when the king is going to
[1:39:18] visit I'm telling you they will decorate
[1:39:20] every
[1:39:22] [Applause]
[1:39:24] amen the all of that week or two weeks
[1:39:29] one month brother sister they will be
[1:39:33] doing rehearsals in choir and each and
[1:39:41] everything
[1:39:44] everywhere learn dances
[1:39:49] why King has desired to visit when these
[1:39:53] people saw something of that
[1:39:56] kind they
[1:39:59] admired and they started to demand for
[1:40:02] the king
[1:40:05] also blessed be the name and that was
[1:40:08] the greatest mistake which they
[1:40:12] made because God was their
[1:40:15] King he the King of Kings and the Lord
[1:40:19] of lords of host he's the mighty warrior
[1:40:24] the champion of all
[1:40:26] Champions just
[1:40:28] imagine these people they were now
[1:40:32] rejecting the champion of all
[1:40:35] champions for us we want the one which
[1:40:37] is the one who is trained by
[1:40:40] men blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:40:44] here we are seeing after I'm just trying
[1:40:46] to give you the background of
[1:40:49] it
[1:40:51] and when they rejected
[1:40:53] God and they asked for the
[1:40:56] king and and SEL was so
[1:41:00] grieving he went before the Lord and
[1:41:04] cried before the Lord and God told him
[1:41:08] give them the
[1:41:11] king they have not rejected
[1:41:15] you but they have rejected
[1:41:17] me and that's why Samuel was
[1:41:22] crying because remember the word of God
[1:41:24] comes to the
[1:41:26] Prophet The Prophet comes to us with the
[1:41:29] mind of
[1:41:31] God already knew the mind of God toward
[1:41:36] Israel and when they rejected
[1:41:39] God by asking for the
[1:41:43] King Samuel knew
[1:41:46] that trouble was
[1:41:49] coming
[1:41:51] blessed be the name of the Lord remember
[1:41:54] last time when we were talking about
[1:41:56] Samuel how he was sent to go and slay
[1:42:00] the
[1:42:03] enemies sorry sa thank you sa when he
[1:42:07] reached there he he slew
[1:42:11] some and spared
[1:42:13] some where was that mistake coming
[1:42:16] from it was not God's will for them to
[1:42:21] have the
[1:42:23] king sa was the choice of
[1:42:27] men blessed be the name of the
[1:42:30] Lord and here we are seeing now
[1:42:35] Trouble When God gave them the king when
[1:42:38] when people demanded for the
[1:42:41] king God gave them the
[1:42:44] king because they rejected
[1:42:47] him and then they chose soul
[1:42:51] because he was big man he was giant
[1:42:55] man with high
[1:42:59] shoulders maybe
[1:43:08] had even our enemies should start crying
[1:43:11] blessed be the name of the Lord and if
[1:43:13] you read this
[1:43:14] scripture and you see how things went
[1:43:18] on Israel were in battle
[1:43:22] day after
[1:43:23] day and the Philistine were against
[1:43:27] them they had the champion as the Bible
[1:43:30] said
[1:43:36] here and the battle was
[1:43:40] boring because the
[1:43:43] philis they had a mighty man
[1:43:47] amen where we have read the Bible says
[1:43:54] go he had six
[1:43:59] cubits when I was checking the average
[1:44:02] normal human being
[1:44:06] tubit is of
[1:44:17] two you find it
[1:44:22] they saw a
[1:44:27] beast we are going to read again and see
[1:44:31] hisry blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:44:33] amen amen amen and here we are seeing
[1:44:37] when they rejected God and God and samel
[1:44:42] and God gave them then men
[1:44:46] chose but in that very
[1:44:49] time
[1:44:52] God told Samuel to go and anoint
[1:44:58] David blessed be the name of the
[1:45:03] Lord when people chose to be
[1:45:08] king God chose David to be king amen
[1:45:14] amen and he had a reason for doing
[1:45:17] so praise the name of the Lord
[1:45:23] today I'm going to read several quotes
[1:45:26] you will bear with
[1:45:27] me
[1:45:29] amen but we shall not take long don't
[1:45:32] worry blessed be the name of the I just
[1:45:35] wanted to encourage to encourage you
[1:45:37] this
[1:45:39] morning say the message the great warri
[1:45:44] David said that I like to see people who
[1:45:46] know where they where they are
[1:45:49] standing
[1:45:52] who knows what they are talking
[1:45:55] about now let us move to verses 31 of
[1:45:58] where we have read
[1:46:05] 1731 we beginning from
[1:46:13] 29 and David
[1:46:19] said
[1:46:23] okay let's begin let's read from 11 and
[1:46:27] when soul and all Israel heard those
[1:46:30] words of philistin they were dismayed
[1:46:33] and greatly
[1:46:36] afraid when they told them to choose one
[1:46:39] man among
[1:46:41] them now David was the son
[1:46:43] of David was the son of the ephra of
[1:46:49] Beth be bethleem Judah whose name was
[1:46:53] Jesse and he had eight son and and the
[1:46:56] man went among men for for an old man in
[1:47:01] the days of Saul and three Elder son of
[1:47:05] Jesse and and followed Saul to the
[1:47:08] battle in the name of his three son that
[1:47:12] went to the battle where eliab the first
[1:47:14] born and the next unto him ABAB and the
[1:47:18] third sham the thir was sha and David
[1:47:22] was the youngest and the three eldest
[1:47:26] followed Saul but David went and
[1:47:30] returned from Saul to feed his father's
[1:47:32] sheep at Bethlehem and the Philistine
[1:47:35] Drew near morning and evening and
[1:47:38] presented himself 40 days and Jesus said
[1:47:42] unto David his son take not uh take now
[1:47:45] for thy Brethren and of this porched
[1:47:49] Conn and and 10 Loaves and ran to the
[1:47:52] camp to thy Brethren and carry these 10
[1:47:56] cheese andto the captain of their
[1:47:58] thousands and look how their Brethren
[1:48:00] fail and take their uh pledges now soul
[1:48:05] and soul and they now Saul and they and
[1:48:10] all the men of Israel were in the valley
[1:48:12] of of Ella fighting with
[1:48:16] Philistines and he rose up early in the
[1:48:18] morning and left the ship with the
[1:48:21] keeper and took and went as Jess had
[1:48:23] commanded him and he came to the trench
[1:48:26] as he host uh as the host was going
[1:48:30] forth to fight and shouted for the
[1:48:33] battle for Israel and the Philistines
[1:48:35] had put the battle in AR against AR
[1:48:39] against Army against Army
[1:48:43] against Army against Army and David left
[1:48:47] his courage in the hand of The Keeper of
[1:48:49] the courage and ran into the army and
[1:48:51] came and saluted his Brethren and as he
[1:48:55] talked with them he behold there came up
[1:48:58] Champion the Philistine of goth Goliath
[1:49:01] by the name out of the armies of fisan
[1:49:04] and spake according to the according to
[1:49:06] the same word and David had them amen
[1:49:11] hope you have been following blessed be
[1:49:12] the name of the Lord here we are seeing
[1:49:15] the sons of
[1:49:16] Jesse three of them went to fight with
[1:49:19] for the king
[1:49:22] and David went and came
[1:49:24] back then after some time his father
[1:49:28] prepared some
[1:49:30] meal and gave David to take to his
[1:49:33] brother in the
[1:49:35] battle blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:49:38] but remember before that David was
[1:49:41] already
[1:49:44] anointed amen remember when God told
[1:49:49] Samuel go in the house of Jesse and
[1:49:53] anoint one of his son as a
[1:49:56] king so
[1:49:59] went and J called all
[1:50:03] son J had seven
[1:50:05] sons blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:50:08] when the man of God came to anoint this
[1:50:12] man amen just
[1:50:16] thought God was going to choose maybe
[1:50:19] his firstborn
[1:50:21] as you're going to see it here amen and
[1:50:25] the man of God was prayed up he was
[1:50:28] waiting on
[1:50:30] God Amen and even
[1:50:33] himself he thought God was going to
[1:50:36] choose the
[1:50:38] first or the
[1:50:40] second so they lined up six of
[1:50:43] them David was not among
[1:50:47] them he was in the wilderness riding the
[1:50:50] father's
[1:50:52] sheep praise the Lord then this man
[1:50:56] became they came before the uh the
[1:50:58] prophet of
[1:51:00] God the first one came amen maybe he
[1:51:06] had a kind of a military
[1:51:10] training you know you know army they I
[1:51:13] think they amongest the
[1:51:14] discipline security Personnel I
[1:51:18] know
[1:51:23] when you're talking to
[1:51:28] them they very displ so this man came
[1:51:31] before
[1:51:31] the the servant of
[1:51:34] God and maybe Was preparing to
[1:51:38] anoint the king the uh the prophet did
[1:51:42] not know the person to
[1:51:45] annointed but he was under
[1:51:48] instruction he was supposed to
[1:51:51] wait until the Holy
[1:51:53] Ghost direct him to the right
[1:51:57] person amen like that s it was during
[1:52:01] the time of
[1:52:03] Simeon when Simeon went to the
[1:52:06] temple there were many mothers with
[1:52:10] babies Simon was even
[1:52:14] blind Holy Ghost L
[1:52:18] Simon where baby J
[1:52:20] was that's why the prophet says God has
[1:52:24] given us the Holy Ghost to lead the
[1:52:29] church amen not Bishops not FP not
[1:52:35] cardal the Church of the Living God is
[1:52:38] led by the Holy Ghost because it's the
[1:52:41] holy ghost that knows the mind of
[1:52:45] God
[1:52:47] hallelujah so the man of God was waiting
[1:52:54] came and maybe Was preparing to do
[1:52:58] so and the Holy Ghost said
[1:53:01] no
[1:53:06] what that one
[1:53:09] passed the second one came along the
[1:53:12] third one
[1:53:15] six1
[1:53:16] surely David he was not even Rec
[1:53:20] I think even by the
[1:53:23] father because how can they tell you to
[1:53:26] bring your
[1:53:28] son that God is going to choose one
[1:53:31] among them to be the
[1:53:33] king and you ignore the last
[1:53:38] one blessed be the name of the
[1:53:41] Lord
[1:53:43] God is revealing
[1:53:47] Simplicity amen just
[1:53:51] thought this boy because he was well
[1:53:56] educated if he like
[1:53:58] today maybe was taken to the best uh the
[1:54:02] best military
[1:54:04] school maybe like maybe was in Sunday
[1:54:08] H where they train the
[1:54:11] best God said
[1:54:14] no blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:54:17] our Prophet tells us Moses was
[1:54:21] trained for over 30
[1:54:25] years
[1:54:27] amen having the best military
[1:54:32] training was the superow of that
[1:54:37] day but when God met
[1:54:40] Moses God took Moses to the
[1:54:43] W to do what to a
[1:54:48] ship am
[1:54:53] amen he took him where he knew wor
[1:54:59] things and he took him in nature
[1:55:03] amen and God train from more 30
[1:55:08] years and the prophet tells us that God
[1:55:13] was uprooting all whatever Moses had in
[1:55:18] Egypt
[1:55:21] Moses did not need what he leared in
[1:55:23] Egypt to liberate his
[1:55:28] brothers amen Moses needed the pill of
[1:55:33] fire glory be to God the church does not
[1:55:37] need cm to go for
[1:55:42] R you don't need to do pents to go for
[1:55:47] Rapture amen yes but you need the Holy

[2:04:56] and David was the youngest and uh the
[2:04:59] youngest and the three eldest son uh
[2:05:02] three Elders followed so but David went
[2:05:05] and returned the
[2:05:08] father
[2:05:13] okay and David left his
[2:05:16] carriage in the hand of the Keeper of
[2:05:19] the
[2:05:23] courage and
[2:05:25] RTO the Army and came and saluted his
[2:05:32] Brethren and as he talked with
[2:05:36] them behold there came up a champion the
[2:05:39] philis of goth Goliath by the name out
[2:05:42] of the armies of the Philistine and
[2:05:44] spake according to the same word and
[2:05:47] David had them that was the worst
[2:05:50] mistake that devil did that
[2:05:54] day David had the Blasphemous word of
[2:06:02] the and all the men of Israel when they
[2:06:05] saw the man fleed from him and were so
[2:06:15] afraid and the men of Israel said have
[2:06:18] you seen this man that is come
[2:06:21] up Sur to defy
[2:06:24] Israel is he come up and shall it be
[2:06:29] that he that that the man who kth him
[2:06:34] the king will enish him with great
[2:06:36] richness and will give him his
[2:06:47] daughter David had heard about the
[2:06:51] rumors when he
[2:06:54] came maybe he used to be in the
[2:06:58] ship but he would admire the King's
[2:07:05] Daughter and then he would take a
[2:07:09] heart have you ever seen a
[2:07:12] sister and you would want to go to
[2:07:16] her but because when you measure
[2:07:19] you maybe you're still in
[2:07:21] school not yet
[2:07:24] stable
[2:07:26] okay let me go look for money
[2:07:32] amen David came and had room and this is
[2:07:37] it
[2:07:38] true that the king
[2:07:42] said the man who will come and fight
[2:07:46] that will enrich him
[2:07:49] bonus of the
[2:07:51] daughter
[2:07:54] amen
[2:07:56] mhm and then and the men of Israel said
[2:08:01] have you seen this man
[2:08:02] okay and they respect the men that stood
[2:08:06] by him saying what shall be
[2:08:10] done uh what shall be done to the man
[2:08:13] that k
[2:08:17] thise came

[2:08:34] Victory and uh and take away the
[2:08:38] reproach from Israel for who is okay and
[2:08:42] David spoke to the man and stood by him
[2:08:44] and saying what shall be done to the man
[2:08:45] that kill this Palestine and taketh away
[2:08:47] the reproach from Israel for who is this
[2:08:53] uncircumcised now he started weighing
[2:08:56] that he should defy the armies of the
[2:08:58] Living
[2:09:01] God he was
[2:09:04] uncircumcised your enemies are
[2:09:08] uncircumcised and David saw
[2:09:11] that had not seen
