it is only [Applause] because it's not coming to take your own ideology but he's coming to take his word praise be to god he has given us a portion of his spirit we are sharing about the time [Music] message but today we are going to go deep praise be to god come and give us away just pray for me and allow the holy spirit to speak to you look at that small man standing before me a small man or a young man standing in front of you know amen i mean and the prophet says you know we have been forced to make a decision there's a time when we have to come to a place where we have got to say yes or no why do you want to come what you saying and that is just in human life amen i mean and if god shall permit i don't believe that we will be able to leave this church tonight [Music] you monitor you stop there is over moving praise be to god come and ever do it he says again that i believe we are not going to leave this church [Music] in the same condition the same way we came in we're trying today praise be to god when we come in the presence of god the word of god in our lives the world but i came to shave lands but there is that one who will come after me why would i want a warrior and i change you my wife is the one who will condemn the world [Music] when you you made a decision to come speak to god come and give us the way amen so we are in the time of decision and where we have read in genesis [Music] do you think it is you you will never high school i think it was the end of the end of time when children were going home there was a time in the holidays i did not have even a credit to call my parents i don't even have money now and they started asking for the money for them that are not yet paid i remember i prayed i meant like it looked like a silly prayer [Music] and remember those stages wish you could make this phone you could make the percentage to rise to at least 100. [Music] because those but remember this time rant was during midday and they managed to communicate home names praise be to god our god is more than ever done things impossible [Music] that is what god can do it he said that in the same condition and the decision was required that he was to decide just on who his son isaac that he would do that he had waited for 25 years and had deceived him from the dead to know that he was uh it was a call and separated the messenger of god [Music] [Music] our societies [Music] and according to what to this spirit quote he says who would be his help me to carry on the plan of god that's why you don't marry because of beauty i don't say that to go and look for ugly second again say brother you have a beautiful sister you say brother you have a beautiful sister [Applause] we are fearfully and wonderfully men dwight on the one hand something that we need to think of they are ugly they are just fearfully men amen but i'm saying variety [Music] so we should learn to appreciate god the way he has made [Music] the physique of that the bible tells us the purpose of marriage we are marrying to bring forth children with the purpose of serving god where is that fear the name of god praise be to god come here amen i mean see the time and it comes for him to make a decision there's some decisions you will have to make for yourself brother that sister attracts me though she is not a believer but when god tells me not to murder i will not uganda [Music] if there's no decision that we have to make sure just wait if there's no decision that we have to make just wait every move on god well [Music] amen i mean everything you want to go through brother buddy all kinds of buddhists not about chickens god wants me to speak a there is no any other voice we should above this voice you know amen i mean i don't care what your church is telling you yes can you say it i don't care what prophet [Music] so the time has been allotted to every man to make his decision whether he is a preacher or a prophet or a church member or what more oh remember what can you say naturally praise be to god come here everybody has got that time to make a decision to amen amina and the time came he said and abram was determined that he did not want his son to marry any believers [Music] to make the same decision about their children that would be good decision for christians today to make the same decision about their children now listen now it didn't make any difference how pretty those unbelieving girls [Music] you are not a believer you are not we are those kind of believers in the way but jesus they are not many believers okay they are not in the world and they're also not in church [Applause] [Applause] there's many ghosts just for there is many ghosts just for money oh man even ministers never wait no they are after money innocent they are chasing money that governs me and this other these others goes for great name for themselves amen it's because they made that decision they have big churches [Music] god is looking for men today [Music] the holy spirit when they hear what is against the world they drop it very fast because you have to make a decision very fast not only that i didn't know when he got to this place where where his message was to be given where to come to four ways when eliza went with a message because remember he was his servant so he went with a message with isaac's message from the dad give his own message today the church is not giving you we are not giving you our own message of faith amen i mean yes there was a messenger he had a message from his master prayer speak to god did not get his own message but he took his master's amen when they start speaking about themselves you will see jesus is not there hey yes when i went to uk when i came to uk when i just landed then there came a lady here he spoke the master's message he was not proud but only spoke of his master [Music] amen i mean what a beautiful picture of servant of god attention is on the master that you know amen i mean in the world [Music] they promised you what they don't possess it's telling about heaven which is either if even doesn't have an idea praise you to [Music] he's going to fall ahead to all amen i mean there was a whole lot of women that he could choose from and the choice had to be imagined amen i mean we don't have time to sit around and think it's over people wonder [Music] you have heard the words and this is the truth you read it from the bible i read the word the bible is [Music] oh you may not want to look at the secret to your life that is how god catholic is looking at a sister or a child who is putting on a trouser and claim to be a belief [Music] when you see why is it true is it really true that the bible that uh women are not supposed to be praise be to god hallelujah hallelujah what do you expect this may be people this may be people sitting here tonight today this will be your last time to make your decision [Music] tomorrow the decision must be get married to sometimes even brothers some unserious brothers they do that is quoting two sisters in the church sister elizabeth sister elizabeth and sister katrina and he's just there because elizabeth has something which he doesn't have and he should also have something which is [Music] it's the most powerful thing that i know of changing twitch amen i mean and then the time had come sorry yeah and the time had come it said i challenged you to then the time came that he had to make a decision on who he would send to select the bride for isaac iguana and here we land in a beautiful lesson of abraham a type of god the father faith amen i mean a type of god the father [Music] [Music] that will take the [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's the one that has been proven to be just amen amen praise be to god come here and there's met the requirement that abram was required met the requirements israel and abrasion abraham just for money we have read that quote wanna tell [Music] amen not only that message see praise be to god come here he was asking for something he could rely on he was asking for
