[0:00] amen
[0:17] I mean
[0:18] amen
[0:19] [Applause]
[0:22] I would like to reach you once again in
[0:24] the name of Jesus
[0:26] Christ
[0:31] that the Lord is giving you Grace
[0:35] to move on in this journey
[0:43] the devil will throw whatever he wants
[0:46] to throw in them in the middle of the
[0:48] road
[0:51] but did you realize
[0:54] that the Bible says to them that
[0:56] overcome
[1:00] and he says that in every generation
[1:04] which means in every generation it is
[1:11] and there were many excuses of those who
[1:14] did not overcome
[1:15] [Music]
[1:22] in our generation it was very difficult
[1:24] in this area
[1:27] but you see in every age
[1:30] despite those things that discourage
[1:35] there shall be those who shall overcome
[1:37] it
[1:39] and so whenever a morning comes and you
[1:43] are finding yourself in your Christian
[1:45] Journey still walking in this journey
[1:47] you will unovercome
[1:50] [Music]
[1:53] and so God bless you overcome us
[1:58] amen and may we continue to overcome
[2:00] every day
[2:04] foreign
[2:07] [Music]
[2:24] [Music]
[2:26] second Peter 1 12.
[2:37] um I'd like you to remember brother
[2:39] shame in prayers
[2:41] [Music]
[2:44] the people there they actually they had
[2:48] I forgot to tell you on Sunday but they
[2:50] had their first service last last
[2:53] Saturday
[2:59] and they told me that it was attended by
[3:02] 16 students
[3:06] and he told me what he preached to them
[3:09] it was a very good subject
[3:13] and so in that meeting they agreed to me
[3:16] twice uh actually some one of them was
[3:19] suggesting every evening
[3:22] but
[3:24] they agreed that they will be meeting
[3:26] twice a week
[3:30] and by God is Grace I'm planning to be
[3:33] taking the second day
[3:37] [Music]
[3:39] I don't know what they agreed on maybe
[3:42] uh Friday and Saturday or Wednesday and
[3:45] Saturday Thursday and Saturday
[3:48] [Music]
[3:49] so I'll be going there every Saturday
[3:53] and we'll share the message with those
[3:56] students
[3:57] I think that is a very good way for this
[4:00] message to go into the aviation industry
[4:06] really I believe that each of us which
[4:15] we can penetrate that area with this
[4:18] message
[4:19] [Music]
[4:22] if indeed you are truly burdened for
[4:25] this truth
[4:28] you want everyone to hear the message
[4:32] you want everyone to go to heaven
[4:35] so I mean you might be a student
[4:38] somewhere
[4:39] you might be going to work somewhere
[4:43] whatever you are doing
[4:46] please remember the Lord
[4:50] amen
[4:52] so we are reading verses 12.
[5:07] I hope everybody's there now
[5:19] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[5:23] you always in remembrance of these
[5:25] things though you know them and be
[5:27] established in the present truth
[5:30] tonight
[5:43] amen amen maybe seated
[5:48] so my subject to you this evening
[5:53] it's part two of what I shared with you
[5:56] last Wednesday
[6:02] how many remember what I shared on on
[6:03] Wednesdays
[6:05] [Music]
[6:07] what was that
[6:12] the message of the hour
[6:15] and so I usually speak for one hour on
[6:18] Wednesday
[6:21] and I'm asking for your undivided
[6:24] attention as we try to see what the Lord
[6:26] has for us tonight
[6:30] so Peter here writes and talks about
[6:33] what he calls the present truth
[6:40] it is impossible for there to be more
[6:42] than one truth in a generation
[6:46] um
[6:48] there has never been more than one truth
[6:53] there is always been one truth
[6:57] and when Jesus came on Earth he said I
[6:59] am the way I am the truth
[7:02] [Music]
[7:05] he did not say I am a truth
[7:11] but he said I am the truth
[7:15] meaning outside of me
[7:18] you cannot find truth
[7:21] there is no truth anywhere else
[7:25] actually Jesus said that all the others
[7:27] that came before me yes
[7:30] they were thieves and robots
[7:36] I am lowly and meek
[7:42] [Music]
[7:55] there is only one truth
[7:58] and that truth will be the same in every
[8:01] generation
[8:04] it can never change
[8:06] it can never change its forms
[8:10] they will always remain the same
[8:14] time will change
[8:17] seasons will change
[8:19] but the truth will always remain the
[8:21] same
[8:23] people even change the people that are
[8:27] on Earth today
[8:29] exactly in one thousand years if the
[8:31] lottery
[8:34] you will not have any of them on this
[8:36] Earth
[8:38] foreign
[9:07] [Music]
[9:50] there are very many of those you find
[9:53] there were many preachers
[9:55] you find there are many uh uh uh
[9:58] prophets
[10:01] for example the book of Acts of the
[10:04] Apostles
[10:06] it was written by a thick Luke
[10:10] he was a doctor I believe those are
[10:15] himself and and and and other books
[10:18] written by other people
[10:20] although there were others who did not
[10:22] know how to write
[10:24] and others who did not even know how to
[10:27] read
[10:27] but God through them he gave his word
[10:32] and when God gives his work
[10:34] in the book of Timothy he says all
[10:38] scripture
[10:40] is given by inspiration of God
[10:45] and he says
[10:59] [Music]
[11:26] the one who came with the with the idea
[11:29] that he met Angels
[11:32] they gave him a book which he called the
[11:36] the the third Testament
[11:39] and he says the Bible is true like a
[11:41] Bible in truth but God gave him a sad
[11:43] Testament
[11:45] in addition to the Bible
[11:48] and there is a big denomination
[12:02] but it is in addition to the Bible
[12:06] you find Muhammad Muhammad he said that
[12:10] what he had
[12:12] he was given to him
[12:15] by administration of angels
[12:20] Mountain there in the Middle East
[12:23] and it's spoken that the Quran
[12:27] is Holy because the Quran has holy
[12:31] scriptures
[12:33] which came by the administration of
[12:35] angels
[12:37] and you have many other books
[12:39] there is a this other book I forgotten
[12:41] its name there's several other books
[12:43] that are considered to be holy books
[12:47] and many people believe in them in the
[12:49] world
[12:51] but all those books
[12:53] came after the Bible
[12:57] there is no book there is no Revelation
[13:01] there is no inspiration
[13:03] that will be more than the Bible
[13:08] that will be true
[13:12] we've got that
[13:38] which we have received
[13:43] are you following me
[13:45] I'm a preacher so I'm preaching this to
[13:48] you but really I'm teaching
[13:52] sometimes I think I said to myself let
[13:54] me just go and be a quiet teacher and I
[13:56] teach this thing really well and I fail
[13:58] because I'm meant difference
[14:05] now I wanted to look at Galatians
[14:12] praise the name of the Lord
[14:17] I want to bring perspective to you
[14:19] regarding this message
[14:21] [Music]
[14:25] verses six I mother that ye are soon
[14:27] removed from him that called you into
[14:29] the grace of Christ and to another
[14:31] gospel
[14:43] which is not another but there be some
[14:46] that trouble you and would pervert the
[14:48] gospel of Christ
[14:56] so in other words when Paul writes to
[14:59] the Galatians
[15:00] he's telling them something very
[15:02] important
[15:04] he's saying that I'm so surprised
[15:08] when you came to the knowledge of the
[15:10] grace of Christ through the gospelmatic
[15:12] research
[15:14] but that you've been called into another
[15:16] gospel now
[15:19] you'll be removed from this goes and he
[15:23] went to another gospel
[15:25] all these others have been telling you
[15:27] are also gospels
[15:30] all these other books are gospels
[15:34] but then he says it is not another
[15:37] gospel
[15:39] but there are some that trouble you
[15:43] and pervert the gospel of Christ
[15:48] the meaning all this other so-called
[15:51] gospels
[15:53] all these new traditions and ideas
[15:59] it is not another gospel
[16:03] the Quran is not another gospel Quran
[16:06] John Smith is Mormon preaching is on
[16:09] another gospel John Smith says
[16:14] oh there is even a Christian Science
[16:16] there are many there are many more now
[16:18] why do you mean it's not entirely
[16:20] something new and in trivia but what is
[16:24] it it is a perversion of the true gospel
[16:31] there have been those that have made big
[16:34] denominations
[16:36] and there have been those that have come
[16:39] and preached privately
[16:42] and they said God sent them
[16:45] but when we see what they are preaching
[16:47] it is not Bible best
[16:50] it is not founded in the scriptures
[16:53] that is how we are able to know
[16:57] that is the perversion of the truth
[17:01] and it is not the original foreign
[17:13] [Music]
[17:22] [Music]
[17:40] foreign
[17:46] [Applause]
[18:24] remember I'm talking about the message
[18:27] [Music]
[18:30] people
[18:36] are something new
[18:39] with what we have seen in the Scriptures
[18:48] it cannot be something different from
[18:51] what was given in the beginning
[18:55] it cannot be a new revelation more than
[18:58] what is in the Bible
[19:03] if it is
[19:08] but I want to tell you this is
[19:24] he doesn't come with a new message
[19:28] he comes with the message
[19:33] listen to what I said the message
[19:36] foreign
[20:48] Hebrews 13 8 says
[20:55] Jesus Christ yes Christo is the same Yom
[21:00] help me finish it
[21:02] yesterday Joe and today and forever
[21:09] what is he trying to say the truth is
[21:14] the same
[21:15] yesterday John today and forever
[21:20] the truth can never change
[21:23] the truth will always be the same
[21:26] that's why when William Burnham came
[21:29] he said I preached what Paul preached
[21:34] [Music]
[21:37] the message
[21:39] is not a new truth
[21:42] though same truth
[21:45] which the apostles
[21:48] but what our religions have done
[21:52] they have perverted that truth
[21:55] foreign
[22:09] but today you know the theologians
[22:15] they look into that Truth uh
[22:23] this one is no longer working
[22:27] let us change
[22:32] the place
[22:34] where it says talking is talking about
[22:36] the deacons
[22:40] wives
[22:43] for them they said let us write let us
[22:46] not read another Bible
[22:48] let us not do another Bible
[22:51] people will realize
[22:53] let us do another version like a Bible
[22:56] yes
[22:59] and then in our version
[23:02] Let Us remove a few scriptures
[23:14] to suit our teachings
[23:19] you know even the homosexuals have made
[23:21] a new Bible
[23:24] did you know the Bible which supports
[23:28] them but in a Bible yeah
[23:30] just the same way the women preachers
[23:32] made themselves
[23:38] just the same with those who don't
[23:40] believe in the Holy Ghost also made
[23:41] their own Bible versions
[23:45] foreign
[24:11] [Music]
[24:17] foreign
[24:26] [Music]
[24:45] [Music]
[24:57] [Music]
[25:11] back again
[25:13] thing this message is not a new idea
[25:17] that's why I keep telling you it's not a
[25:19] new church
[25:30] and we who received it we are still
[25:34] contending for it now
[25:37] hallelujah amen the Bible says content
[25:40] for that Faith
[25:43] which was first given to the Saints
[25:46] we are contending for it
[25:50] by believing it
[25:53] but when we do to the people who have
[25:56] been perverted
[25:58] they think we are wrong
[26:01] but we are not wrong
[26:04] we have the present truth
[26:07] that's the message
[26:10] when brother came the prophet of Our
[26:12] Generation
[26:14] he came with a message of restoration
[26:22] as foundations Mommy
[26:24] of the Apostles
[26:26] to me never not be
[26:29] hallelujah hallelujah so it's not a new
[26:32] idea was the scene TV they are the ones
[26:35] with a new idea
[26:37] it's not a new idea and I ask you a
[26:41] question now
[26:42] can there be more than one truth what's
[26:45] up
[26:49] now we cannot say this is everybody
[26:52] going to the Rapture
[26:54] should be in our church
[26:58] the things I'm speaking are very
[27:00] important
[27:01] just to understand what we believe
[27:15] the message cannot be denominated
[27:20] if the message for example was like the
[27:22] uh Seventh-Day Adventists
[27:26] [Music]
[27:28] what does it mean it means for you to go
[27:31] to heaven
[27:33] you must join that nomination
[27:44] you Rapture the members of that
[27:46] denomination
[27:48] that denomination
[27:54] but what did God decide to do he said my
[27:58] truth will remain
[28:00] I am going to send someone
[28:02] who is completely
[28:05] I'm going
[29:02] this message has been sent to all the
[29:04] nominations
[30:04] one way to another
[30:07] [Music]
[30:20] what do you tell them
[30:22] remember
[30:24] in 10 words 20. in a day you have with
[30:28] them
[30:28] I've been spoken to them about Jesus
[30:31] Christ
[30:32] if you haven't
[30:34] I doubt that you are convinced
[30:41] you may be on the road
[30:46] but if you're convinced
[30:48] if you're fully convinced
[30:51] you are going to be concerned
[30:57] foreign
[31:40] are you not so happy to know that you
[31:43] are not members of this church
[31:46] but you are members of the body of Jesus
[31:48] Christ remember
[31:51] and how do you become a member of the
[31:53] body
[31:54] I believe in Jesus as your personal
[31:56] Savior
[31:58] and by being baptized in much water
[32:02] and then he fills you with the Holy
[32:05] Ghost
[32:06] that one makes you a member
[32:09] of the body of Jesus Christ
[32:16] he will burn out those flesh he desires
[32:22] he will take you away from the world
[32:25] she will separate you from the world
[32:29] she will put you in love with him
[32:33] you will be reading the Bible you have
[32:36] been praying you'll be going to church
[32:40] foreign
[32:53] it's not just another religion
[32:55] if it's another religion I better leave
[32:58] it
[32:59] because it's just a wastage of time
[33:02] we are not here to build another one
[33:05] man's Kingdom
[33:08] I feel sorry for people who uh uh you
[33:11] know try to build Kingdoms in the
[33:12] message
[33:17] cannot build kingdoms
[33:20] the kingdom of God
[33:24] and it only starts with a message with
[33:26] the truth with the word
[33:32] so
[33:33] I read for you last time this quote I
[33:36] failed to read it again
[33:39] not for one moment do I bring a message
[33:42] to the people that they may follow me
[33:43] again
[33:48] oh join my church
[33:51] so even you people who go to preach on
[33:54] the streets
[33:56] what is the target
[34:00] every one that goes to so to do what
[34:02] they call witnessing
[34:06] I'm going to bring church members
[34:10] [Music]
[34:12] isn't it
[34:20] [Music]
[34:25] so that they can build their Kingdom but
[34:29] let me tell you
[34:32] the True Blood of Jesus Christ
[34:35] is not going to do it that way yet again
[34:38] why do we evangelize
[34:41] why do we preach to the Lord
[34:44] we have only one purpose it's not for
[34:48] them to join our church
[34:51] that is nothing
[34:53] you can join my church and still not go
[34:56] to the Rapture sovereign
[35:05] [Music]
[35:28] [Music]
[35:31] if they join our church
[35:33] it should only be for the purpose of
[35:36] them being continuing on on that road
[35:39] path of being encouraged to pursue that
[35:43] is
[35:48] I I even wonder let us not just be
[35:51] church members
[35:53] let us be people here
[35:56] who have a purpose
[35:58] you know why we are here we are not here
[36:02] to field the church
[36:04] I don't care whether I'm preaching to
[36:06] two people or 100 people
[36:08] what I care about is the people who have
[36:11] a burden and a desire to go to the
[36:12] Rapture
[36:15] [Music]
[36:17] if I have five of them
[36:20] oh I'm very satisfied
[36:23] but I know they are not only five in
[36:26] this city
[36:27] they're more than a hundred they're more
[36:30] than 200 but you can foreign
[37:56] Hallelujah man
[38:01] someone was telling me last Sunday
[38:02] Sunday I don't remember he was saying
[38:12] about just instruments they have drums
[38:17] I think they are supported by whites
[38:22] I just smiled
[38:24] I said to you
[38:28] none of all those things
[38:31] I've been purchased by anyone outside
[38:40] foreign
[38:58] but I'm trying to encourage you
[39:00] don't let your motive
[39:03] don't let your attitude
[39:05] don't let yourself
[39:15] we are not here for money
[39:18] because we have the truth to the
[39:20] generation
[39:23] are you hearing me chat you young men
[39:27] you ought to be on fire
[39:30] we all ought to be on fire
[39:33] whenever you have free time use it to
[39:37] preach somewhere
[39:41] give some trucks somewhere
[39:44] be on fire
[39:47] be moved by the Holy Ghost
[39:50] when you meet with your brothers
[39:56] get into the message
[40:23] to
[40:28] our generation
[40:32] you see
[40:34] when you talk about Abram we're gonna
[40:37] quit blame Abraham at his time
[40:40] he was the only reason
[40:45] Hallelujah man
[40:49] that God did not destroy them
[40:59] he had already sent down the angels
[41:01] to go and destroy the city
[41:05] foreign
[41:23] but in that interchange
[41:26] Abraham delayed God
[41:29] yes Hallelujah
[41:35] amen it was because of the abundance
[41:40] Abraham is the type of the Bride I
[41:42] believe
[41:49] somebody's still out there
[41:52] we have to have Vision as a church
[42:00] [Music]
[42:16] okay what about this number what about

[45:22] his ministry today
[45:26] what happens
[45:29] when they did those things
[45:32] people's eyes were blind
[45:35] ziba it's just like if they pop today
[45:40] performed one Miracle yeah
[45:44] Catholicism
[45:53] saying that they're following the
[45:54] message
[45:57] no God is here Among Us
[46:00] it will blind them
[46:03] and this is what has happened in our
[46:06] generation
[46:11] what did he do because
[46:17] he called the new name of Abraham
[46:20] you've got the new name of Sarah
[46:23] and what did he do there right there and
[46:26] then they had their body chains
[46:30] because of these angels
[46:33] let me tell you we do in our generation
[46:36] we have received an end-time message
[46:44] an angel means a messenger
[46:47] with a message
[46:56] but this message has come with one Papa
[47:00] bring forth our body change
[47:04] one of these days we are going to change
[47:07] our bodies
[47:09] that is what the Rapture is
[47:13] Amen to prepare us for the coming of the
[47:16] Lord
[47:19] amen present truth
[47:22] this is not a new thing seeming to
[47:25] repeat has happened before
[47:27] but friends if we are going to be the
[47:31] answer of Abraham
[47:36] let me ask you
[47:38] Abraham was a type of the bride and if
[47:40] we are the bride today
[47:44] what are we doing with the lost souls
[47:49] do we have anybody at all
[47:54] foreign
[48:05] [Music]
[48:13] but Abraham had a promise before
[48:15] marriage
[48:20] and out of that a very huge generation
[48:25] he was waiting so we are also waiting we
[48:30] have a promise from God the promise of
[48:32] the Rapture so we are waiting but while
[48:36] we are waiting
[48:38] God sends a message
[48:41] God sends a message
[48:46] to fulfill our promise
[48:49] but not too many
[48:52] have paid attention
[48:56] when Abraham received that message he
[49:07] is
[49:12] you know he was like all over the house
[49:27] everything had to come after
[49:30] yeah
[49:38] my personal ideas
[49:41] the only thing I want to know about it
[49:45] is my messenger
[49:49] and I want to know the message
[49:52] because this is the message of my house
[49:57] foreign
[50:23] so he said I'm not making a church
[50:28] some fellowship organizations
[50:32] [Music]
[50:33] I have never done that and I will never
[50:35] do that
[50:37] I have no interest in those things
[50:39] but I do have an interest in the things
[50:42] of God and the people
[50:43] [Music]
[50:45] if I can accomplish just
[50:47] I would be satisfied
[50:50] that one thing is to see established a
[50:53] true spiritual relationship between God
[50:55] and Men
[51:00] is
[51:24] [Music]
[51:30] listen this one thing a chicken
[51:35] to establish a true spiritual
[51:37] relationship
[51:41] between God and man
[51:44] where men become nucleation Creations
[51:49] filled with his spirit
[51:51] and live according to the world
[51:55] so if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[51:58] you are not a part of those
[52:01] that have attained his purpose
[52:11] let me tell you if you don't have the
[52:14] Holy Spirit
[52:17] you need to know
[52:20] and you asked
[52:24] the Lord will fill you anytime for any
[52:28] time from now Rapture
[52:30] if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[52:35] you
[52:37] will be left behind
[52:58] I'm telling you the truth
[53:03] you must be sure that you are full okay
[53:07] don't just come to church for the sake
[53:10] of something completely one of our
[53:11] associations we're not here for
[53:13] associations
[53:17] to get a relationship with you
[53:20] whatever we do that is
[53:25] when we invite youth conferences that is
[53:31] free services in the week that is
[53:36] if we learn to pray that is
[53:41] to get a relationship with God
[53:45] to be filled with the holy spirit amen
[53:58] the theme but I'm ending the service
[54:01] tonight
[54:02] Genesis chapter 6 verse 13 with Genesis
[54:05] chapter 6 and verses 13.
[54:11] and God said unto Noah the end of All
[54:14] Flesh has come before me for the Earth
[54:16] is filled with violence through them and
[54:18] be behold I will destroy them with the
[54:20] Earth make thee an arc of gopher wood
[54:22] rooms shall thou make in the ark and
[54:26] Shout preach it with within and without
[54:28] with Peach and this is the fashion which
[54:31] Thou shalt make it off the length of the
[54:34] ACT shall be 300 qubits the breadth of
[54:36] the Ark 50 qubits and the height of its
[54:40] uh of it 30 cubits a window shall thou
[54:43] make to the ark and in a cubit shalt
[54:46] thou finish it above and the door of the
[54:49] Ark shalt thou set in the side thereof
[54:52] with lower second and third stories
[54:55] shall thou make it and I be and behold I
[54:58] even I do bring a flood of waters upon
[55:01] the Earth To Destroy All Flesh water in
[55:04] is the Breath of Life from under heaven
[55:07] and everything that is in the Earth
[55:09] shall die
[55:10] but with thee will I establish my
[55:13] Covenant and thou shalt come into the
[55:15] ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and
[55:18] thy son his wives with thee
[55:20] and over and of every living thing of
[55:23] All Flesh two of every thought shalt
[55:26] thou bring into the ark to keep them
[55:28] alive with thee they shall make they
[55:31] shall be male and female or false after
[55:34] they are kind and of Qatar after they
[55:35] are kind and of every creeping thing of
[55:37] the earth after his kind two of every
[55:40] thought shall come unto thee to keep
[55:42] them alive and take thou unto thee of
[55:45] all food that is eaten and thou shalt
[55:48] gather it to thee and shall be for food
[55:51] for thee and for them thus did Noah
[55:53] according to all that God commanded him
[55:55] so did he I see you've been reading
[56:01] now I want you to see that Noah had
[56:03] Specific Instructions
[56:13] this was not a usual Arc
[56:17] Ade
[56:19] was an arc with the instructions from
[56:22] God
[56:24] foreign
[56:34] no I was only
[56:36] nowhere
[56:37] the voice of God
[56:39] instructed him and told him how the ACT
[56:42] should be
[56:43] [Music]
[56:44] the type of wood
[56:47] type of Windows and everything
[56:51] but he come God had told him how it
[56:55] should be
[56:57] and why did God tell him to do this
[57:00] because God was telling Noah to prepare
[57:04] people because it was going to rain
[57:08] [Music]
[57:11] so what was the message of the hour at
[57:13] that time
[57:15] it is going to rain
[57:18] that was the message
[57:25] one of the reasons why is because it had
[57:28] never happened before
[57:30] but with God there is no new thing under
[57:34] the Earth
[57:35] to God this was not true because it was
[57:38] out of the mouth of God
[57:42] it wasn't new because it was out of the
[57:46] mouth of God
[57:47] but it was true
[57:50] whatever God speaks is true
[57:54] there was no proof at the time that it
[57:56] could happen
[57:59] but building the ark was the only
[58:02] provided way in that day
[58:06] yeah
[58:09] and I want to say in every generation
[58:13] God has a provided
[58:17] he sends them the message
[58:29] that is very far away from their reality
[58:35] now the things that the Bible says
[58:44] and real real woman
[58:51] says
[58:53] but because we tell you brother says
[59:02] can I tell you today
[59:04] it is it has nothing to do with William
[59:06] Brothers
[59:09] [Music]
[59:13] I've discussed this with some of you
[59:16] where he said under no circumstances
[59:44] that is not here everything
[59:49] could be backed up by the Bible yes
[1:00:00] in the Old Testament and in the New
[1:00:03] Testament
[1:00:04] the Bible is very clear
[1:00:06] when it comes to marriages
[1:00:11] followers Believers in God
[1:00:15] always
[1:00:20] in the Old Testament it was in a shadow
[1:00:25] it wasn't a type
[1:00:27] because we know that Israel was natural
[1:00:30] but for us we Are Spiritual Church
[1:00:36] Abraham called his servant Ibrahim
[1:00:41] and told him
[1:00:47] that my son Isaac
[1:00:51] will not marry from these women
[1:00:59] did you hear that nature
[1:01:02] foreign
[1:01:09] [Music]
[1:01:53] foreign
[1:02:19] foreign
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:03:07] foreign
[1:03:40] foreign
[1:04:29] is there some way
[1:04:32] if we follow the same way
[1:04:36] the same condition
[1:04:40] that somebody else
[1:04:42] we need the same conditions
[1:04:48] God will do the same thing
[1:04:51] that he did for them
[1:04:54] oh if he doesn't do it he did a mistake
[1:04:59] foreign
[1:05:09] I'm like so and so in the Bible
[1:05:13] I don't have a child of my own and yet
[1:05:17] I'm married
[1:05:18] now let me go to church and pray
[1:05:21] come and pray and pray and then you say
[1:05:24] God
[1:05:25] I've made the same condition
[1:05:29] and you take that from your heart
[1:05:32] and you say I've met the same condition
[1:05:36] now if God doesn't give you a child
[1:05:39] like he gave to Hannah
[1:05:42] either you've not met the same condition
[1:05:47] oh God
[1:05:52] does God do mistakes
[1:05:55] is he the same
[1:05:57] he will do the same thing over and over
[1:05:59] he will never get gifted because of the
[1:06:01] same God
[1:06:05] make the conditions
[1:06:07] and then see if God will not
[1:06:10] do the same thing
[1:06:13] that's the good thing about our God
[1:06:16] by the way let me tell you church as I'm
[1:06:19] finishing our God is very predictable
[1:06:22] cartoon
[1:06:26] very predictive
[1:06:29] there are some people you work with
[1:06:31] you don't know what they will do next
[1:06:34] there's some people you can be with in
[1:06:36] life
[1:06:37] and you know for them they always have
[1:06:39] surprises
[1:06:41] so you will not know what he will do
[1:06:43] next
[1:06:48] if he has done this it means this is
[1:06:51] happening
[1:06:54] foreign
[1:07:22] read character after character
[1:07:52] all those people who got married
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:24] the conditions
[1:08:27] because the master of does not change
[1:08:31] it's always been and it will always be
[1:08:34] the same message
[1:08:37] because it's the present truth
[1:08:40] I cannot say that I've really gone into
[1:08:43] the teachings
[1:08:46] but like I say this is just the
[1:08:48] beginning I I trust that God will help
[1:08:50] us to get deeper and deeper into the
[1:08:52] subject and see of course as much as he
[1:08:54] wants you to get you will get let us
[1:08:55] stand on our feet
[1:09:05] Hallelujah
[1:09:09] praise the name of the Lord
