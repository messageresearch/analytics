one desire in our hearts to receive from you we worship and praise you because you are worthy of all our worship and praise you came and died for us that we might attain the righteousness of and now we ourself to you asking that you will come and speak to directly to our hearts for you know each of our needs Lord we commit this service into your hands in Jesus name [Music] amen this evening uh how many enjoyed the service on Sunday now I realized that um I thought I had spoken for 1 hour and a half but I noticed when I checked today that I had spoken for two hours and a half but I fig I figed nobody recognized actually realized that we went for that long enjoyed the service and uh speaking on the principles or the on the principle of so I I realize that uh there are many brothers I spoke to a friend a few friends of mine and about three or four in the past have spoken on the principles of [Music] success yes but I believe that the principle yes there are many principles but the principle is only one and that is so and uh I told you Yer on Sunday when I was speaking that we could actually take each of these things that you so and we take a service about them and I said if you pray God will move on my heart and I will speak little more details and so today I'm speaking on sewing hor and harvesting am access ACC yeah all right so we will now go to the word I see there are two new faces that I do not know very well you're welcome feel feel comfortable in the house of God although the brother looks a bit familiar I don't remember you the word when know one another is your wife can praise God Church we greet you in the name of our Jesus Christ my name ISU sorry this is my de wife Years brother Church spe speckled I work from ethopia and fellowship from Brother way Fellowship Bible Way Fellowship yes God bless you all just today to come and visit you and fellowship together amen you amen praise the Lord uh yeah I I remember when I was at the church inis no wonder he was remembering the yeah so the brother fellowships in our church in Ethiopia this is a a younger Church of the other one I was a pastor there for almost uh six six seven years includes before the church started because we were really there when the church had started for about 3 or four years with my family and so this is just the second church and pastoring and so that's why I said this one is the one of the other one so in that way I might say that you at our headquarters anyways we know our headquarter is in heaven amen shall we just go to the word right away uh we are going to okay there is a lot I don't even know which scripture to read I don't have an opening scripture since we are standing let us just read John 3:16 and then we can get seated for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen you may be seated so this evening by God his grace I would like you once again to give me your undivided attention uh our awareness day is not always very long uh so we hope we'll go through this quickly nonetheless I would like us to be relaxed just ask the Holy Spirit to speak to you so I'm speaking on sewing honor and harvesting axes now how many here have ever wanted to meet someone great or someone very successful and maybe you never got to meet them because maybe after they left the stage you did not have access to them or maybe you wanted to speak to someone who is famous people that we call Role Models because they are very famous but you have no immediate access so you may not have access to such a person you may not have access to political or business or sports stars but i' would like you to know that you have access to the the the the most successful F thing that there is access to the greatest that there is and that is God himself is the greatest that there is and you have access and the scripture we read in John 3:16 gives us that access the moment someone believes in him the moment you believe listen the moment you believe in Jesus you have access you have access to the blood Jesus said when he said it is finished it means immedi immediate access was granted because you see when man sinned in the Book of Genesis the Bible says that man would die the soul that sinth that Soul shall die but we find that you know when when Jesus brother bam says that death means total separation from God Access F deny even he put angels to keep the the way to keep the access to the tree of life and so we find that when Jesus died on the cross he said it is finished meaning the access immediate access has been granted the moment Jesus died whoever now believes in him he should not perish so now believing in him gives you full access direct access to the blood direct access everything that Adam lost whoever honors his word he or harvests immediate access to God because he said you know who is the word in the in in the Book of John chapter one says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and in verse 14 it says that the word put on flesh meaning God put on flesh Jesus was God Jesus was the word of God but he was God he was God in his fullness praise the name of the Lord and so we notice here that when he says I am the way the truth and the life there is no other access to the to the to the Tree of Life there is no other access to God there is no other door to the there is no other gate Jesus is the gate Jesus is the door Jesus is the Jesus is the access Jesus is the word of God when you believe the word you have immediate access to God we now no longer have to pray through someone the Roman Catholics tell you you have to pray through someone because God is Holy and you cannot access God directly and so that's why they have many SA those that are holy and can access God on their behalf you have people like Mary she's holy because she's a saint you have people like you know other people who died and maybe the popes and others and so for them they have no access but for you you have access you can go to God directly you don't need any intercessor the Bible says there is one God and one mediator between man and God man Christ Jesus is our access to God and so but uh starting that way today I want to speak on sowing H and harvesting you see if if you really want God if you want go to access God you have to reverence his word you have to believe his word you know you accept Jesus as your savior to draw close to draw him closer to you you know to to um how what's the right word in English to accept him yeah they said to accept him as your savior to come to him as your savior to believe him as your savior to receive him as your sa now when you do that you have access and Jesus is no longer a person physically here the blood is not in a bottle somewhere the blood is right here in the form of the word when you believe the word you have received the blood when you deny the word you have denied the blood and therefore you have no access to God but whoever believes the word of of the hour he has accepted amen the blood I want you to realize this church that God has been revealing himself Amen in in portions from the very beginning of the church ages are you listening from the beginning of the of the Ephesian Church age up to the last Church age God has been you know revealing a little bit of himself in the in the first church age where was God the only way to access God in the first church age was through the blood of course we see the blood the blood is enough blood cannot be shed again blood was shed once and for all are you following me so now the the blood where was the blood in the first church age it was the word the word that Paul preached what was it it was the bleeding word you know in the second Church H third fourth and now we in the last Church where is the word amen Christ is in the word again the bleeding word what we call the message of the hour in every day Christ reveals himself through the blood amen and the blood is in the word when you receive the reveal of your day you have accepted the blood of Jesus and you have received direct access so now when you saw H you have V access and that's the reason we are going to go in the Rapture but let me ask you a question do you know the perfect uh Vindication that someone has received the Holy Spirit anybody knows it [Music] no one no believer knows it how do we know that you have the Holy Ghost come on brother say it all that is okay but you see all the other things are all right you know the signs the Wonders you know the life and everything but our prophet told us that if you claim that you have the Holy Spirit and you reject the word of your it shows you don't even have the Holy GH Believers of Every Generation the Perfect Vindication that they had the Holy Ghost they received the word of their I'm not saying mentally receiving if you have received the word of your day if you have accepted the word of your you must live the life of it that's the proof that you have accepted the word of your in the days of Noah the proof that they received the word of their day they enter the ark so you see we we have received the word of our day and we are honoring the word and that's why Believers of this message amen we are assured that God is going to rupture out of the Believers of this message because we have received the word of our I am assured that I am saved because I've accepted the word of my I am assured that I'm going in Rapture because I'm a Believer now I want to go through a few things about honor and I want you to listen to me carefully tonight um first I want us to look at you know serving someone else when it's not required or convenient you know that serving someone when it is not required or convenient for [Music] you it actually brings access to you it brings access to you are you following me I pray that the holy spirit will help us to be able to get into uh the things that he revealed to me for you let us first look at Genesis 24:14 [Music] quickly now because we have a lot to to cover and I don't want to belong and let it come to and let it come to pass that the dam to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy Dam thy car was drink also let the same be she that thou Hast appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou Hast showed kindness unto my [Applause] master okay now listen listen now is honor honor is high respect great esteem you know showing credit to somebody and you know I've noticed that if there is something that is lacking among the younger generation in the message of the hour it is showing honor we do not know how to S not show but to S honor we do not s hon we don't even honor one another we don't honor the Servants of God we don't honor the men of God that God is using in a minut we don't our parents you know we disrespect and look down on one another everybody think that you know I'm higher than another one and that has actually made us not to be prosperous that has closed many doors on many of you many doors which were actually supposed to open in your life have been closed for so long because of inability to so and so today I want to teach you about sewing hor and then you will see how you can Harvest or reip access I I give you I will give you a few examples from the word and then we'll call it an evening and so we see first of all here when when um when when Abraham sends he tells swe says come touch my thigh he touches his thigh and so he says swear that you you will you will not take a son you will not take a wife for my son from among these canites swear that you will go in the land of my people among my own people and get a son for my and get a wife for my son and so you know did not know how to go about it but if there is one thing that had H for for Abraham and so he honed Abraham and he said I will do it as God leaveth and so when Ela left and and he went to where Abraham came from by the by the by the by the well he begins to pray a prayer you know why did God even answer that prayer because this man had honored his master when you honor people other people God will respect and honor your prayers there are even certain prayers God may never answer because you do not honor others and and so now he he prays a prayer and he says let it come to pass of whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray that I may drink and she shall say drink and I'll give th I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou Hast appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my now this was it looked like an impossible prayer but I want it to look at it two ways first you look at it on on the direction of uh of this man and then I also wanted to look at it from the direction of the woman here is a woman from a family and of course she was not married I do not know whether her parents were wealthy or not but you know she desired to be married and this may be good for you sisters who are not yet married you see she she was not married but you see someone was praying a prayer that was just for her but she did not know I I want to show you something there are things that God has prepared for you you don't know yet but the power to receive them is Right within you in just one word amen first of all says in the message influences be conscious of how little you are the Way Up Is Down he that humbles himself shall be exalted but he that exalts himself shall be a best so you don't see yourself how big you are but you know you should be conscious each time and every time of how little you are oh my follow me Clos you're going to learn something that will help you in your life last Sunday and today I'm preaching practical things so in Philippians 2 three the scripture says let nothing be done through Strife of vain Glory but in liness of Mind Let each esteem other better thans praise the name of the Lord but do we really believe that many times everybody thinks that they better than the other we do not esteem each other as if the other is better than me what we have is competition you know pastors are competing the lady is competing musicians are competing you know you know mothers are competing husbands are competing wives are competing children are competing let me tell you we are not on a competition amen the place Christianity is not a competition Christianity is a place that you can find and be conscious of how little you are because the man we are following he was the god of Heaven he created heaven and Earth but he came down in Philippians chapter 2 he says he humed himself in a form of as a servant and because he was found in a fashion as a man heed himself amen even to the death of the Cross you know he he was God he HED himself he would have just said one word and everybody would be destroyed he kept himself together he said I will not do this I will not show my power I will not demonstrate my Authority because I want to Avest something I want to Avest access into the human rest I must humble myself I must be so small that I will confuse the devil if you humble yourself you confuse the devil that's why the devil came to Jesus and he said but tell me if you be the Son of God he was not sure he he looked as if he was but he was too humble so he was confused God cannot be too humble let me tell you if you're a great man you will be humble I can now predict your future if you are going to be great you are humble now or you will humble yourself people who are proud they never go so far Pride will never take you so far Pride will bring you down you have to come to a place where you realize I am nothing I am completely nothing Jesus himself said without him I can do nothing even me I am nothing without Jesus Christ all my plans my ambitions my thoughts it is nothing and that's why we have to esteem other each other better than ourselves this is a principle of reaping and harvesting access the seed of honor it opens immediate access to Greatness now let me tell you just so you be alert when you see the pastor preaching about trials and suffering you know God is preparing you to go through them but if you see God preaching to us about greatness and success and God is preparing you for it so I want it to be aler some will catch it others will miss it and I'm speaking to you in the name of Jesus Christ whoever will catch it will possess the things we're talking about here so the seed of Honor opens immediate access to Greatness immediately imagine what Rebecca had to do I was I was studying today and I took time to examine that was before Rebecca and we have a Rebecca today in in the church my wife is Rebecca and see Rea had to feed 10 camels that was the task ahead of her she had to decide to do it you cannot honor anybody because they demanded for it it has to be your personal decision to give somebody honor the man only asked for water he said I'm going to ask for only water to drink but the woman that will honor me the woman that will just offer to feed my camels also without me asking she will be the woman she will be the woman be wife to Isaac and so I I was studying and kind of looked at the 10 camels do you know how much a cam drinks I looked at it I was amazed 7 75 L of water now that means she had to fetch 750 L of water 750 L that is the minimum because the Bible says that she she fed the camels until they were satisfied let's say that she fed she fed each 75 L that is 7 50 L and that means because you see at that time they had um they had Jans of about I don't know if they were Jans of about 18 16 l so we are talking about 40 to 50 times the woman going down to the well and coming back again going down and coming back again but I want you to see something every footstep she took to the well and back to the back it was humility it was humility it was honor she was honoring this man that she didn't even know she was humbling herself she was bothering herself she did not have to do this it was a b to her come it was inconvenience it was inconveniencing her she did it by Fai because she was moved in had to do it going and coming but let me announce this to you every Journey she took was a closer walk to her direct access it was a Clos walk to Greatness every water she fed she came closer to her greatness she had no idea that everything was cooking itself the more you humble yourself and the more you H others you are coming me closer to your greatness you are coming closer to for God to lift you and put you in your place praise the name of the Lord 50 times going down the street down and up sweating this was not required of this was not convenient for her she did it out of horor and the Harvest was plent we do you know how long it took for her to enter into to her great God doesn't reveal everything imagine if she had seen a dream she would have done it with all strength seen a dream but God was quiet he just waited for her character to make a way for her her character to bring her [Music] access amen and she honored this man and F this water and swe and got tired but while she was doing that even she was opening her own ACC to Greatness did she know that soon will be a wife of the greatest man in the land she would be a wife of a man who has a promise God himself Isaac a man who didn't all the promises of Abraham she would be a wife to a man whose lineage would bring forth Christ himself she did not know she was going to be a matri but what gave that access we must learn honor within ours all gifts that this man had became her and Father's everything he had became their in hours she was taken away to Isaac in hours but first she had to s a seed of H there are things you can look for in your life pray for them fast for them believe for them and they will never come until you saw the seed [Music] of from around 2011 2012 I just decided to give this testimony because as I was studying it became real to me open up you know I got in touch with brother Eddie bis brother Edie bisc mentored me in in the ministry most of the things that I know in how to go about with Ministries because of him I listen to a lot of his sermons I texted with him a lot I talked with him a lot and so one day he writes me and he surprised me he said me two things told me two things he said I believe you will come and speak to our young people here and and and they have usually camps and so and then he said I'm sending you an invitation letter to come and visit us here in Canada now I was excited I was very young I think I don't remember how old I was I took that letter and the other documents and applied for a Visa I was denied a Visa now that's 2012 almost every one or two years I was given another letter for application of another VIs because he told me he believed that I would go and visit them and so I even gave up I kind of felt no I'm not going to keep applying for visas and I I have an expectation it's going to be given to me and it is rejected each time I said no I'm not going to do this again even when I was in Ethiopia in 2015 I applied again for a Visa it was rejected I'm tired of it I said I'm tired of you about 2 years ago uh I was um given another letter and that I was supposed to apply for another Canadian Vis that is when I met brother brother Mich and they kind of felt well you should come again and try again and see what happen I said um this whole thing I'm really not into it anymore because I've been broken my heart has been broken many times said well you should try and and see what happens so I I received the letter and kept it after after a few months while I had that letter one of our elders here Pastor St called me said uh well of course to him he looks at me as a son as a because I'm much younger than him and he's our senior so he told me I'd like you to come and um help me because I'm old these things now are internet based please come and assist me I I I'm invited to Canada and my Visa is expired he has been traveling there I think since the 1990s but I'd like you to come and assist me because I know you know these things better in my heart I said I know these things better and I've never got a vis myself well I said to myself anyways is my senior I cannot say no and with within my heart let me tell you friends I am purposed God revealed this to me some years ago and I am Pur to honor all people especially the elders especially the my elders I am Pur to H them respect them you will never hear me running down any preacher talking against any preacher even if they've done something wrong even if they Pentecostals I am purposed that I will honor all men that's what our Prophet did and that's what we as young people in the message should do he he did not give me fuel I had to drive my car I had to go through the hustle and drive to I would have said well you want me to help you come in my house but my I felt like he's my Elder I should honor him I should go to his house so he invited me I went to his church and um it took the whole day the thing is very complicated write this do that so I went through the whole thing packed up my bugs came back home and then you know the Holy Spirit spoke to me he said now you can submit your application his VIs before it could come out it took him more than one year I went with you Isa yeah it took about one year for his Vis to you know come through and eventually he got the Visas of course him and his wife and so now I was back at home you know I was like ah now it has even taken one year for him but the holy spirit said no up submit your application I said but now heart submit your application so I told my wife I'm going to submit my application but only this one time so I submitted the application paid the money and everything online and do you know how long it took three months before the end of three months two months and a few weeks 10 year Visa I only asked them to go there for two weeks but they told me the government of Canada has given you permission to now come multiple entries for 10 years I never went to a witch doctor I never went to F any documents I submitted the same things I was submitting it's up to you to say because of this because of that but all I know one thing did it I sold hor in a man of God life and God granted me access when you see doors close on you it is because you need to H somebody humble yourself don't lift yourself now I know that was a personal thing but I said it because I know it would help many of you many doors which are closed in your life some of you you don't even have jobs you even know someone else who wants a job you found a job but you can't even tell them about it because you feel like it is you who and you don't get it and you don't tell them about it and so both of you remain jobless God is waiting for you to honor someone else and then he will grant you access we must respect one another look at someone as if someone is greater than you some of you will take so long to get married because you think you looking for money because you think you you looking for this and that but you will not even get those things because you are not sewing the right seats God is waiting on you to S the right seats to Grant you the necessary access what you're looking for what you're praying for so you can continue praying do this for me God do this for me but he said there is a principle to it if you do not do the principle you will not get the Harvest I told one I told someone the other day if you want to eat me what do you do he said you buy it I told him that's a poor man's mentality if you want maze you s it and then you reap a great har and you will eat for many days a rich man will think that way think about having plenty not just buying for one time and then you have to go sweat get more money buy again let us s the right seeds and reap the right Harvest praise the name of the Lord I would like us to look at another aspect of sewing honor that is by presenting a significant gift of hor did you know that it gives you immediate access immediate access 10 ver1 and when the queen of shba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to prove him with hard questions and she came to Jerusalem with a very great with a very great train with camels that bear spices and very much gold and spices and precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her [Music] heart we understand that Solomon was the wisest and the richest king on Earth at that time everyone would have desired to meet Solomon everyone would have desired to shake his hand be associated with him it was not easy for anyone including even if you a king or queen to meet and spend time with Solomon the man was not only rich but he was the wisest of all Kings and Men world L but one thing gave access to Queen of she because she she she gave significant Gifts of honor to this King let us read verse 10 follow with me to verse 10 and she gave the king 120 talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Queen of Sheba gave to the king the the Bible says 100 talents of gold now we're talking about substance here when she was now everybody all of us in the message we know that the woman went to King Solomon you think it is easy is it easy for you to go to the president of the country but yet someone can come from Kenya Orica and just go and walk to him there are things that give access you need to understand the princip it was the woman didn't just walk there no she there's a principle she followed she did not come empty-handed this was a rich man he did not need anything from anybody but you see there are things that give access amen and H is that thing that gives access and honor can be given in many ways and this woman here brought gifts of hor just small gifts it was great gifts it was great substance significant gifts all right follow me closely she came with 100 talents of gold I was checking how much is a talent and I noticed that um 100 talents is equal to 120,000 ounces of gold ounces ounces that's how we call it here we count it as ounce one o of of gold it is 120,000 o no say what I'm saying don't put in your head just interpret it 100 Talent is equal to 120,000 o all right so right now right now on the market is $230 200030 now this woman came with 100 20,000 yes now you know how much that is doar 243 million 840,000 that is just gold if she's just visiting just visiting and she also apart from that she brought much spices precious stones and you know that reminded me of you brother Andrew you know brother Andrew was going to get married this is a very educated girl you know Master's holder you know and and you know he really wanted to impress the parents so that they can you know so that you can get access and so brother W was the chairman he kept on telling him this is a previsit we take a lot of things you know Andrew said leave this for me if I tell you the things we took you would think we had gone for an introduction and the parents were imp and the brother was welcomed like a king and he got 100% access in the same same way this woman was wise Andre were very wise and you see this woman was also very wise she didn't go empty handed she went with 243 million spices a lot Gold Silver and you know what she got 100% to the king and all questions were answered she was blessed when time came for her to leave the king didn't just tell her you can go the king said give for gifts and gifts so she also went away with bags and bags of gifts from King Solomon the Bible does not lie when it says give and he shall receive it is true and to say Amen to if you want to gain access sometimes to some people sometimes in in some situations you don't need to go empty-handed even when you come to God do you know that you should never come empty never because you want to get access to God someone said does it mean we are going to Bri god well if it is bribing everyone that has ever worshiped God hased him you come to God to worship Him you come with a sacrifice right from Genesis AB came with a sacrifice came with a sacrifice AB came with a sacrifice everybody came with a sacrifice when you come to a great man you have Amen to show him honor with your substance praise God first Kings 10:13 and King Solomon gave unto the Queen of Sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which Solomon gave her of his Royal Bounty she returned and went to her own country she and her servants praise the name of the Lord and was on Solomon and the queen of remember the wise men 210 it says when they when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him meaning they honored him and when they had opened their Treasures when the first thing they the first thing they did is to honor him they worshiped him they didn't begin talking touching open their Treasures are you following me are you following me church that is why when we as a tradition in many Traditions when we first see a baby we give them money or something as a owner what I believe it it comes from the Bible the wise men were wise they honored him with a lot of treasures they came with expensive Treasures they began opening it spreading it gold frankincense praise the name of the Lord priests Kings Great Men all these they wanted to see the Messiah they were not granted access the King was not granted ACC the high priest was not granted ACC no one in the in the church was going to when the wise men went to the to the Palace the king said do you know where he is tell us where he is when you find him so that we to May worship him but you see the angel guided this because these ones hored amen Jesus Christ but the other the king wanted to kill him so other words if you want if you don't want to honor him you want to kill him but as far as I'm concerned I want to honor him I don't want to honor him with my mouth only I want to honor him with all my because I want to get great access when you hon him with all your substance you get great access amen into all these Treasures they were not granted access these wise men oh my tell me one reason why they were granted access they honored him we their are Treasures they honored Jesus with you know and they have vested immediate access no wonder Jesus talked to this man and he said he said how what can I do to get eternal life and Jesus answered go and do the Commandments he said I've done them since I was he says well then there's one more thing you need one more thing go to your Treasures that's the one more thing got your Treasures take them sell all of them and come follow me now I want you to follow me on this one closely so wise men when they came they the Bible says they gave all their they remained with nothing they gave all their treas Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler give all your Treasures to the poor come follow when you come to Jesus and you want great access to you need to sell all your treas whatever you feel is of value whatever you are holding on to you need to let it go and let him be the preeminent one in your life you know what that will do for you it will gain you great access to many riches that come from the word you know there are many riches that come from the world he wants us to prosper and not with the prosperity of the world but with the prosperity that he gives but many of us become so impoverished because we are holding on to the the prosperity of the world we are chasing after money we are chasing after knowledge we are testing after wisdom we are testing after women let me tell you that the word God say give it all up give it all up when you give it all up he's going to give you the true Treasures he's going to give you a true woman he's going to give you two Money Two The Blessing he gives he has no sorrow upon it let me tell you when God makes you rich in the are three things you are not sorrowful you are not running up and down you are not running away you are not Sleepless you are peaceful because your riches let me tell you that's what I want to have but the riches the world gives oh you will never lack you will never you know have peace because the devil gives with one hand and takes with another but when God gives you he gives you to for your joy to be full praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord I wish I can go in details but we don't have time now I I'll take two more and then we'll close so see here you can also give honor or S Honor by submission and this brings immediate access as well look at Ruth 1 vers 16 Ruth said entreat me not not to leave thee or return from following after thee for thou goest I will go and where thou loest I will Lo your people shall be my people and God my God where th dest will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death put part thee and me you know Ruth honed Naomi by her [Music] submissive submission is not easy in the message cruelity of sin prophet of God says now if we are perfect in submission to the Holy Spirit if we were perfect in submission to the holy God would lead us by the Holy Spirit just like Adam LED animals of that and the messenger testimony says the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles for it was the Holy Spirit in the Apostle setting forth an example through all the ages what the Holy Spirit was then it is now and what the Holy Spirit did to that church it does to this church this church will be just as submissive to it as that church was it will bring it just the same results do you believe that it will just submit to Christ you must submit to Christ when you submit to him whatever the Holy Ghost did then he will do today not different now I want to show you here little did Ruth know that there was riches coming submission will make you a reputation with the powers that you have submitted [Music] under your reputation or your character will always bring you recognition are you following me if you have that character of submitting yourself amen you will become reputable and you will be recog let me tell you this what I'm think I'm talking about today it does not apply in the church world only some of you have jobs it applies there as well it applies in the world it applies everywhere these are principles of the word of God and see people who are promoted you can see someone be in in at a place of work for 10 and in the same position and another one joined two years promoted and then you begin they theying wa it's not always bribing you don't have to rely on that submission is key it brings promotion it will also draw Financial anointing upon your because of the hor you show and submit to them if I look at the life of Ruth I want to look at verse verse 11 of chapter 2 Ruth all right answered and said unto her listen to these words it has fully been showed me all that thou Hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of of thine husband and how thou has left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy Nativity and come into a people which thou knowest not there the Lord recompense th work what recp is recompense is to make amends or to for loss or harmful comp yes to compet you know let me tell you when you submit yourself to Jesus Christ whatever you lost compens you cannot say I lost this I lost I lost this if you lost friends he recompenses if you lost money he recompenses if he lost you know position he compens promotion compens The Other Woman went and and and she thought that she would gain everything but we don't even ever hear of her but we see Ruth when Ruth lost everything amen Bo was not listen understand understand what I'm saying was not just anyone you know when let me tell you when when anyone speaks it's all right but when a great man speaks it means something big this was a rich man to begin with all right number one number two this was a man that was in the Lage of so he had the authority and the power to redeem everything and when he comes to this woman he says I've heard of your testimony I've heard how your husband died I've heard how you forsook your people how you've been kind and submitted to Naomi I have heard everything that you have done after he said that he said that now the Lord recompense thy Work that was not Idol talk that was prophetic because the man that was saying it he had the power to redeem her and everything she had lost he even had the money to recompense her for everything she had lost so he said the Lord recompensed her and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou come to [Music] trust how many trust the Lord hallelujah am oh my can I prophesy to you amen because you have come under the wings of the most high to trust him may he become best to you whatever you have lost may he give you a full reward for your work may you prosper his wings oh Hallelujah do we believe that now someone might have told Ruth those are just words but amen Ruth by Revelation she would tell them wait and see so tell somebody wait and see wait and see shortly shortly shortly the people thought were bigger than Ruth they were now Servants of Ruth the people that thought were living something little for rul they realized they are now serving rules because Ruth was their Master because she became the wife of of their lord the wife of boas and do you know Ruth Ruth hallelujah hallelujah Ruth got begot a son with with with boas I think his name was calleded and out ofed comes who J are you following and out of Jess comes Who David are you following and out of David Comes Who the Messiah Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory to God when you get access when you get access there are big things in your when you get access in your will come greatness when you get access your children and their children can never be Ser Hallelujah when you get access let me tell you when you get access no man can stop you you become Unstoppable you get access you become Unstoppable you have a door that is open before you that no man can close no man could open so no man can close I said I want to get that door open I want to get that kind of access you need to give him a shout and a CL Hallelujah hallelujah oh yes Lord submitted herself and she got access and the Bible tells us to submit ourselves in Proverbs 28:13 he says he that cover his sins shall not Prosper but whoever confesses and forsake them Shall Have Mercy all right submit yourself to God James 4:7 submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you Ephesians 52 right now now this is another one list wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord amen sister as you submit yourself to your husband great access is being open to you the women out there will be saying she will go she will go it will fail they don't know you are swing a SE which will bring forth a har that they cannot stop my goodness hallelujah hallu what about to your pastors Hebrews 1317 them but have rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch over your soul as as they that must give account may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you if your pastor is serving you with grief it will not be profitable for you but when is happy with you it will be much profitable for you Hallelujah but you have to s a seed of hon to your man of God to your pastor to a man that ministers the word of God to you you must seed amen of Honor by submission of Honor by giving your ti is an offering of Honor you know what does it do it brings access praise the name of the Lord and I'll finish with Matthew 9:21 amen faith and honor brings immediate access the woman came to him and say for she said with within herself if I may his gar I Shall Behold Hallelujah now this touch this touch we think it is just like a touch it's not just like a touch no it's more than a light the Greek word is which means to properly attach yourself you know it's not a light it's not a momentary Embrace of the word you have to fasten yourself to the word not to ad every word of God and that's how you get your healing so you have to Hon the word that's even why sometimes when the preacher is preaching you know you know you know you you saw a brother coming to shake my let me tell you these things are Revelation these things are Revelation some of you can call Pentecostal but I'm telling you it is revelation when you realize there's anointing in the room you be like that woman who said if I can pass the of his G come and I say I receive it I receive it what happened you done what the woman you may be sick right there you can't because you have sold a of hor Hallelujah the Bible says they used to bring handkerchiefs on the bodies of the Apostles what the body of what is on my body nothing but what was happening doing it that Paul would put handkerchiefs his body as he's preaching the word and then he sends it to the sick that would heal them we don't hear of those things in the message I will tell you why do not honor our men of God and if you do not do that there is no way you can get access to Healing this isic the says even their Shadows would heal the sick oh God I want that same anointing but what will bring it down one thing will bring it down H is the right to get access to him if you don't honor the man that ministers to you then you cannot prosper even if he not your pastor we've had people who disrespect other men respect their Pastor you have to treat every man of God with reverence With Honor with respect you go in a shop and you find a man man of God there you find a pastor you find a minister don't buy for yourself and leave them to go and even worse you tell them Pastor buy for me that's how we lose blessings come on I don't want you to buy anything for me I'm teaching you ways for you to prosper you find a pastor in in the store or a minister and you buy something tell you pay for yourself anday for them you do not know what you have ripped you've HED them by I remember there was a day I was Ina with brother Michael we were coming from going to and we had we G to a restaurant to try and have a meal breakfast and uh and Pastor Steven found us there and so we each other and then he so after our food we went to pay and they said everything is paid we said what everything is paid I was so sad because someone had taken my blessing and then when I asked the woman who did that she said the Pastor who was here he was more wiser than I he took my blessing let me tell you when you go to restaurants when you go to shops you must fight to take the blessing honor each other honor each other respect one another and wives respect and honor your your your husbands it will open access whatever you desire your husband will do for you without you even asking and even the devil cannot stop it you know that H is a great weapon and if you saw H you will reap and harvest access God bless you amen you may stand on your feet Hallelujah let us
