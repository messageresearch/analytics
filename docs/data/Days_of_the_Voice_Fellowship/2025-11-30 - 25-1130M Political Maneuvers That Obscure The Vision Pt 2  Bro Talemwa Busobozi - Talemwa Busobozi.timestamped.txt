[1:07:14] So you you
[1:07:17] can use me. [music]
[1:07:20] Give myself [singing]
[1:07:22] away.
[1:07:25] All this morning, [music and singing]
[1:07:26] Lord,
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; every part of me, Lord,
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; I give myself.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; I give myself
[1:07:34] to you.
[1:07:37] [music and singing] You can use me.
[1:07:40] I want to tell you something this
[1:07:42] morning, saints,
[1:07:46] you know, while we close our eyes and
[1:07:48] meditate
[1:07:51] on his goodness and on his mercy,
[1:07:55] We've had a long week.
[1:07:58] You've been in many places, done a lot
[1:08:00] [music] of things,
[1:08:03] had a lot of responsibilities,
[1:08:05] [music]
[1:08:07] family, work, and many things. [singing]
[1:08:10] And maybe some of you have unanswered
[1:08:12] questions.
[1:08:16] But I want you to
[1:08:19] come to this moment.
[1:08:23] If each of us could be sensitive enough
[1:08:26] to know we in the presence of the king,
[1:08:32] I would like you and me and all of us to
[1:08:34] forget everything. [music]
[1:08:39] And if you would have this desire in
[1:08:41] your heart
[1:08:44] and say, "Lord,
[1:08:46] you say it in your word,
[1:08:48] having done all
[1:08:52] stand.
[1:08:54] I'm here standing in your presence
[1:08:57] and I desire Lord that you will bring
[1:08:59] the word of life to me
[1:09:02] [music]
[1:09:03] and that you will heal my heart
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; and you would energize me.
[1:09:11] You would heal me.
[1:09:13] You would speak to me.
[1:09:17] Don't listen to your body if you're
[1:09:18] tired.
[1:09:20] Close
[1:09:23] your mind from that.
[1:09:26] Close your mind from your problem.
[1:09:31] And I just pray that even as I speak
[1:09:32] these words, you're just beginning to
[1:09:34] ascend in the spirit.
[1:09:38] [music] In your in prayer,
[1:09:40] just begin to speak to him.
[1:09:44] We are we are worshiping him this
[1:09:47] morning.
[1:09:50] One word for for he for you is enough
[1:09:52] from him. [music]
[1:09:56] But you would have to first be in the
[1:09:58] spirit
[1:10:01] that would receive from him.
[1:10:05] If you are in the flesh,
[1:10:08] you cannot receive from him.
[1:10:12] But if you are in the spirit,
[1:10:14] you can hear from [music] him.
[1:10:19] So I want you to surrender all.
[1:10:23] Let everything
[1:10:26] be given unto him. The Lord of lords,
[1:10:29] [music]
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; the one who knows all things.
[1:10:35] This life is not [music]
[1:10:37] my own.
[1:10:40] To you I belong.
[1:10:44] I give myself.
[1:10:47] I give myself to you. [music]
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; This life is not my own. [music]
[1:10:59] To you I belong.
[1:11:04] I give myself.
[1:11:06] I give [singing and music] myself
[1:11:08] to you.
[1:11:10] Let somebody tell him that one more
[1:11:12] time. [music]
[1:11:13] Lord, this life is not my own.
[1:11:18] To [singing] you,
[1:11:20] I belong.
[1:11:22] Lord, I give myself. [singing and music]
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; I give myself
[1:11:28] to you.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear your voices. Tell him
[1:11:31] one more time, everybody.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; To you I [music] belong.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; To you I [singing] belong.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; I give my
[1:11:42] Give myself
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; I give myself
[1:11:46] to you.
[1:11:51] [music]
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Give [singing] myself away.
[1:11:55] [music]
[1:11:56] Oh Lord,
[1:11:58] I do that this morning. Lord,
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; I give myself to you, Lord. [music]
[1:12:04] I ask the Lord you come and help us. You
[1:12:06] come and minister to us, the ones of
[1:12:08] life. Oh, I give myself
[1:12:12] [music and singing] away.
[1:12:18] [singing and music]
[1:12:20] I give myself away [music] so you
[1:12:27] can use me, [music]
[1:12:35] Lord Jesus.
[1:12:37] Here
[1:12:39] I am Lord
[1:12:45] my brother, my sister.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Together Lord we have come to you this
[1:12:51] morning.
[1:12:54] Help us Lord Jesus to hear from you this
[1:12:56] morning
[1:12:59] for you know the need and the desire
[1:13:02] of the spirit in our lives this [music]
[1:13:04] morning.
[1:13:07] Would you come Lord and provide
[1:13:11] you asked us to pray
[1:13:13] and to ask for our daily bread. [music]
[1:13:18] Lord we ask for today's bread.
[1:13:22] We ask that [music] you come and provide
[1:13:23] to us.
[1:13:25] Everyone speak to him. Ask Ask. The
[1:13:28] Bible says, "Ask and shall receive."
[1:13:32] No matter where you are seated, way in
[1:13:33] the back,
[1:13:35] just ask him. What is your need this
[1:13:38] morning? What is your need this morning?
[1:13:41] Don't wait until the preaching.
[1:13:45] I don't even know what to say, [music]
[1:13:48] but but but he knows what you need.
[1:13:52] But I ask him and he shall receive.
[1:13:55] So Lord, will you put in words in my
[1:13:57] mouth,
[1:13:59] words that I didn't even have in my mind
[1:14:03] that I will be able to speak them this
[1:14:04] morning according to the needs of your
[1:14:07] children.
[1:14:08] Lord, we commit this service into your
[1:14:10] hands.
[1:14:12] We ask that you come and have your way
[1:14:15] [music] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; I'd like to greet and each and every one
[1:14:29] of you in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:14:30] Christ this morning.
[1:14:33] Would you please turn to your neighbor
[1:14:34] and tell them God bless you brother. God
[1:14:36] bless your sister.
[1:14:40] Nice to see you
[1:14:43] in the house of the Lord this morning.
[1:14:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:49] Amen. It's a wonderful thing to be in
[1:14:51] the house of the Lord.
[1:14:55] Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; We are going to go to the scriptures
[1:14:58] right away this morning.
[1:15:02] And we are reading in the book of Joshua
[1:15:12] chapter 5.
[1:15:35] If you are there, just say amen.
[1:15:39] And I am requesting those who don't have
[1:15:41] Bibles
[1:15:44] to please uh buy a Bible.
[1:15:48] I was actually thinking about it the
[1:15:49] other day
[1:15:51] that uh you know everyone should have a
[1:15:53] Bible.
[1:15:55] Every Christian should carry a Bible.
[1:16:00] Don't get a just a pocket size.
[1:16:04] Get one as big as you can.
[1:16:08] that you can you can carry and scare
[1:16:10] some demons around.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are reading out of the book of
[1:16:18] Joshua
[1:16:21] chapter 5
[1:16:26] vers 1 to 7.
[1:16:30] from Samville.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when all the kings
[1:16:34] of the Amorites, which were on the side
[1:16:37] of Jordan westward, and all the kings of
[1:16:40] the Canaanites, which were on the side
[1:16:43] on the sea, which were by the sea, heard
[1:16:46] that the Lord had dried up the waters of
[1:16:48] Jordan
[1:16:50] from
[1:16:53] Just wanted to make sure that I was
[1:16:55] reading the right place.
[1:16:57] um where by the sea heard that the Lord
[1:17:00] had dried up the waters of Jordan from
[1:17:02] before the children of Israel until we
[1:17:05] were passed over that their heart
[1:17:08] melted.
[1:17:10] Neither was their was their spirit in
[1:17:13] them anymore because of the children of
[1:17:17] Israel. We will take verse by verse by
[1:17:19] verse brother.
[1:17:47] At that time the Lord said, "Uh, can I
[1:17:51] have more sound, brother?" Thank you.
[1:18:03] And Joshua made him sharp knives and
[1:18:06] circumcised the children of Israel at
[1:18:08] the heel of the four skins.
[1:18:17] And this is the cause why Joshua did
[1:18:21] circumcise. Look at that word cause,
[1:18:28] vision,
[1:18:30] purpose.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And this is the cause.
[1:18:34] Why Joshua did circumcise?
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; All the people that came out of Egypt
[1:18:40] that were males, even all the men of war
[1:18:43] died in the in died in the wilderness by
[1:18:48] the way after they came out of Egypt.
[1:19:03] Now all the people that came out were
[1:19:05] circumcised. But all the people that
[1:19:08] were born in the wilderness, by the way,
[1:19:11] as they came forth out of Egypt, them
[1:19:14] they had not circumcised.
[1:19:29] For the children of Israel walked 40
[1:19:30] years in the wilderness, still all the
[1:19:34] people that were men of war, which came
[1:19:36] out of Egypt, were consumed, because
[1:19:38] they obeyed not the voice of the Lord,
[1:19:41] unto whom the Lord swear that he would
[1:19:44] not show them the land which the Lord
[1:19:48] swore unto their fathers that he would
[1:19:50] give us a land that flowth with milk and
[1:19:53] honey.
[1:20:18] So you see saying sin has a penalty
[1:20:25] and sin is disobedience
[1:20:28] of the word.
[1:20:30] There's a penalty to it.
[1:20:34] And the Bible says to him, you may ask
[1:20:36] me, what is sin?
[1:20:38] In James, it says, to him that knoweth
[1:20:40] to do good and does not do it
[1:20:46] and doesn't do it, to him it is sin,
[1:20:53] and sin has a penalty.
[1:20:57] vers um 8
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; 7. And their children whom he raised up
[1:21:04] in theirstead,
[1:21:05] them Joshua
[1:21:07] circumcised, for they were
[1:21:09] uncircumcised, because they had not
[1:21:12] circumcised them by the way.
[1:21:28] Amen. You may be seated.
[1:21:40] Brothers and sisters,
[1:21:45] uh yesterday we were at um the
[1:21:50] introduction ceremony,
[1:21:54] brother Enoch.
[1:21:56] Uh
[1:21:58] is he here this morning?
[1:22:01] Ah, right over here. Stand up so people
[1:22:04] can see something.
[1:22:06] Yeah.
[1:22:08] Uh, brother Enoch was introduced in his
[1:22:11] in the wife of in the family of his wife
[1:22:13] yesterday. Wife to be.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, she she she's I thought she's here,
[1:22:21] but I think she's not here right now.
[1:22:24] So, uh, we just want to say
[1:22:26] congratulations to you, brother Eno.
[1:22:30] Everything went very well.
[1:22:32] when we went in the room there to talk
[1:22:36] matter of fact pastor Robert was also
[1:22:38] there
[1:22:40] the parents and um you know some elders
[1:22:44] and I didn't tell you we had a very
[1:22:46] spiritual uh discussion in there
[1:22:52] was like actually a prayer meeting
[1:22:56] God really gave us grace
[1:22:59] and uh you know I had also had some time
[1:23:01] to have some fellowship with the with
[1:23:03] the father with the father of the sister
[1:23:08] and on this note I want to say this
[1:23:12] I have realized
[1:23:15] because I've been on several weddings
[1:23:17] both here in another place but I can
[1:23:21] tell you
[1:23:22] uh if you start wrong
[1:23:27] you usually end wrong
[1:23:32] and the process is not always pleasant.
[1:23:36] But if you start right
[1:23:39] then the process will be pleasant
[1:23:43] and the end will be good
[1:23:47] because you see one thing that you know
[1:23:50] that as pastors we do not make decisions
[1:23:52] for anyone.
[1:23:56] I've told in my life in my life as a
[1:23:59] minister
[1:24:01] I think I've uh the closest I came to
[1:24:05] advise someone against marrying somebody
[1:24:07] was two times
[1:24:14] and uh but each of those times
[1:24:18] you can see well they insisted and got
[1:24:21] married
[1:24:23] but still their marriage has been
[1:24:25] bumped. all day.
[1:24:30] And what I'm saying is really connected
[1:24:32] to what we were sharing on Sunday and
[1:24:33] I'm going to be continuing with it also
[1:24:35] today.
[1:24:39] You know how to give honor and respect
[1:24:41] the man of the hour that God has raised
[1:24:43] for you.
[1:24:49] You see, brother Bam says if you cannot
[1:24:51] respect the the man
[1:24:56] you at least respect the office the man
[1:24:58] holds in God.
[1:25:03] Because you see, if God is going to
[1:25:05] speak to you
[1:25:08] and he has chosen a man,
[1:25:10] you will only go through that man in
[1:25:13] that season.
[1:25:16] So if you bypass, God has provided way
[1:25:19] for that time, for that season for you.
[1:25:25] then you are opening up yourself for
[1:25:27] heartbreaks and pain and suffering.
[1:25:33] You know, I've I've seen people, you
[1:25:35] know, who would rather get counsel and
[1:25:37] advice from their elder brothers or
[1:25:39] elder elderly people in the in the
[1:25:42] communities
[1:25:47] than getting counsel from their pastor
[1:25:51] because they think it's about age.
[1:25:56] This is not about age.
[1:25:58] your life and God's purpose for your
[1:26:00] life.
[1:26:02] He has entrusted a pastor
[1:26:07] if you have one, which you should,
[1:26:11] and a husband, if you have one, and a
[1:26:15] father. These are three people that God
[1:26:19] has placed in your life. Each of us,
[1:26:22] each of us, we have one of those.
[1:26:26] And for you sisters who are not yet
[1:26:28] married, you you have to.
[1:26:31] And those people are usually very very
[1:26:33] important
[1:26:36] for you to dis um you know ignore their
[1:26:41] counsel in your life.
[1:26:46] When you are considering to make
[1:26:48] important decisions
[1:26:52] like marriage is one of them.
[1:26:56] you should always seek for that counsel.
[1:27:00] So, and I and I say that because, you
[1:27:02] know, I've noticed that whenever a young
[1:27:04] man is getting to, you know, wanting to
[1:27:06] start getting into a relationship with
[1:27:08] somebody.
[1:27:14] Some have thought
[1:27:16] they should go start it
[1:27:18] and only come to the pastor when they
[1:27:20] are 100% sure.
[1:27:25] because they don't want to get ashamed.
[1:27:29] What if I go and I tell him and then it
[1:27:32] doesn't work out?
[1:27:34] I will be ashamed. No, that's not the
[1:27:36] approach.
[1:27:38] The approach is you go to the pastor
[1:27:41] because you are not sure.
[1:27:44] You need counsel,
[1:27:47] you need prayer, you need leadership.
[1:27:51] Praise the Lord. And I've had a few that
[1:27:53] have come to me several times,
[1:27:57] you know, start a relationship and uh,
[1:27:59] you know, along the way in the middle
[1:28:02] things don't work out. But you see,
[1:28:05] because they were already in touch with
[1:28:07] me
[1:28:09] and I wasn't really making any decisions
[1:28:11] for them, but
[1:28:15] the relationship,
[1:28:18] you know, what to do, what, you know,
[1:28:20] things talk about
[1:28:22] along the way they realize they it just
[1:28:26] can't work out.
[1:28:29] So what what they usually do
[1:28:32] then you also have to now guide them
[1:28:36] how to break up
[1:28:40] as Christians
[1:28:42] as believers without a heartbreak.
[1:28:47] I have people in this church that have
[1:28:48] broken up before
[1:28:52] like broken up before broken up a
[1:28:53] relationship.
[1:28:57] But you know they can still live and
[1:28:59] love each other genuinely
[1:29:03] because the relationship was guided.
[1:29:07] But if you go behind the leadership
[1:29:13] and then you want to do everything on
[1:29:14] your own,
[1:29:16] they will break your heart. they will
[1:29:19] squeeze it and then you you you now come
[1:29:23] back when you are hurt
[1:29:26] and these are the kind whereby you be
[1:29:28] like I don't even want to ever see that
[1:29:30] person IN MY LIFE EVER again
[1:29:35] and then you wonder are they going to
[1:29:37] the same heaven
[1:29:40] praise the Lord so when you think you've
[1:29:42] seen someone brother
[1:29:45] come to the right office
[1:29:48] let's Talk it over. Let's pray about it
[1:29:52] and be guided.
[1:29:54] And sister,
[1:29:56] if you think you've seen somebody,
[1:30:00] uh, just go to prayer
[1:30:04] and wait upon the Lord because you're
[1:30:06] not supposed to be seen. um you know
[1:30:09] these days actually I've seen women also
[1:30:12] proposing to men
[1:30:17] you know but Jesus said he did not he he
[1:30:20] did not choose us
[1:30:23] we did not choose him rather
[1:30:26] he chose us
[1:30:28] praise the lord he chose us
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; you believe that saints
[1:30:33] he chose us so even in marriage
[1:30:37] the man chooses the woman
[1:30:40] and the woman accepts the choice.
[1:30:45] How many believe that?
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Can we do that later, brother? And and
[1:30:49] how many believe that it's a man that
[1:30:51] chooses
[1:30:54] and the woman accepts the choice,
[1:30:58] turns down the choice.
[1:31:00] So, she also has a choice to make.
[1:31:03] And no one can make a choice for
[1:31:05] anybody.
[1:31:08] No one can make a choice for you.
[1:31:11] No one should make a choice for you.
[1:31:15] Some people are very highly enthusiastic
[1:31:19] and they would like to you know do a lot
[1:31:21] of commendations.
[1:31:25] Oh sister, brothers
[1:31:27] to begin with I think that is wrong
[1:31:31] because if it if they get married and
[1:31:33] the things don't work out they will
[1:31:34] blame you
[1:31:38] but if it happens just still always
[1:31:41] ensure to make your own decision
[1:31:47] anyway. So in the process of all that so
[1:31:49] I was just saying brother but you know
[1:31:50] you know introduced me to u the the you
[1:31:53] know we had a lot of meetings of course
[1:31:55] with the the sister and him and then
[1:31:57] also met the father of the sister
[1:32:05] and uh we had very fruitful conversation
[1:32:10] as well as the father the past of the of
[1:32:12] the gun
[1:32:15] and um you know uh that that is very
[1:32:17] good.
[1:32:19] So the wedding is on 31st January,
[1:32:21] right?
[1:32:24] January. So that is after our youth
[1:32:26] camp.
[1:32:29] So I think it will be the first wedding
[1:32:30] next year.
[1:32:34] If no one does their wedding before
[1:32:39] because we have about three or four
[1:32:40] couples in the in the pipeline.
[1:32:45] Brother Julius and and and um is not
[1:32:48] here this morning
[1:32:51] and Sister Faith
[1:32:54] because he only has a Sunday off.
[1:32:58] He only at his work has Sunday off only.
[1:33:06] So um is the and it's the only time he
[1:33:10] had and he wanted to you know go see the
[1:33:13] parents
[1:33:14] on his side
[1:33:18] uh together with the sisters well
[1:33:22] you know so we just remember them in
[1:33:24] prayers
[1:33:26] that God will give them grace but they
[1:33:27] told me that they'll stream the service.
[1:33:32] Uh I'm happy to see brother Joseph
[1:33:36] and his wife, Sister Mariam.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; So, you're no longer a spouse to each
[1:33:43] other. You're now married to each other.
[1:33:47] Someone yesterday was telling me, "When
[1:33:49] are they coming off off of the moon?"
[1:33:55] Well, they're finally here.
[1:33:59] And church,
[1:34:01] let me see how you do it at DVF.
[1:34:04] I'd like you to officially welcome
[1:34:06] Sister Mariam to DVF.
[1:34:12] Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; We welcome you, sister.
[1:34:16] And uh you know, most of the people here
[1:34:19] are young like you.
[1:34:22] I know you already have some friends
[1:34:24] here.
[1:34:26] It's not only your husband.
[1:34:28] So, I'm sure you'll have a a wonderful
[1:34:30] fellowship with us.
[1:34:33] It's a journey, friends. It's a journey.
[1:34:36] We are in a journey, a long journey
[1:34:39] on this earth.
[1:34:41] If God gives you people that you can
[1:34:43] walk with,
[1:34:46] just love and cherish them.
[1:34:49] Everyone has failures.
[1:34:52] Every one of us has weakness.
[1:34:55] But you see, if you can be able to
[1:34:56] overlook the person's weakness,
[1:35:02] and love them genuine.
[1:35:05] That's what sweet fellowship is.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; You know, if I I looking around, if you
[1:35:11] know, we were I was just picking on
[1:35:13] everyone's weaknesses
[1:35:17] and then you pick also on mine,
[1:35:20] none of us can be here,
[1:35:23] you know. But but if we can love each
[1:35:25] other,
[1:35:27] the Bible says love covers a multitude
[1:35:29] of sins.
[1:35:32] So which means that if you love
[1:35:35] you will also tolerate others.
[1:35:38] So let us learn to tolerate each other
[1:35:41] love each other regardless
[1:35:45] because the love of God
[1:35:47] doesn't have conditions.
[1:35:50] The love of God is um is a free. It is
[1:35:55] um um you know you don't have to do
[1:35:57] someone doesn't have to do anything to
[1:35:59] qualify.
[1:36:04] You just love them.
[1:36:06] Turn to your neighbor. Tell them I love
[1:36:08] you.
[1:36:11] Amen. Don't even worry even if it is a
[1:36:13] sister
[1:36:16] with the love of God.
[1:36:19] Maybe if it's a sister, you can add I
[1:36:20] love you with the love of God.
[1:36:25] Because they may come to my office and
[1:36:27] and tell tell me that brother so and so
[1:36:29] actually told me he loved me and then
[1:36:31] now he's engaging to another sister.
[1:36:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:41] So I know people who were at the wedding
[1:36:43] yesterday, traditional wedding yesterday
[1:36:45] are tired
[1:36:48] and had a few hours to sleep and others
[1:36:50] have not even come to church this
[1:36:51] morning.
[1:36:53] I see those who have come. Please, God
[1:36:55] bless you
[1:36:58] and don't listen to your body.
[1:37:01] Focus on the spirit this morning.
[1:37:04] Sister Esther lost somebody
[1:37:07] and I think a cousin
[1:37:10] and so if you can reach out to her and
[1:37:12] um you know um uh give her some
[1:37:15] condolence message.
[1:37:19] This morning she asked me to give a
[1:37:21] contact from um of another place where
[1:37:24] she had traveled because she needed to
[1:37:26] pick a child from the from the uh from
[1:37:28] the school.
[1:37:34] I directed her to to the church there.
[1:37:38] I was just checking. I don't remember
[1:37:39] the name of the place, but uh she I know
[1:37:42] she's with us in the spirit.
[1:37:45] Are you ready for the word this morning?
[1:37:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; I was just looking here.
[1:37:53] I know you are used to sitting with your
[1:37:55] wife, brother uh Brian. And I don't know
[1:37:58] what happened.
[1:38:01] You know when I see couples you see you
[1:38:03] see like Joseph seated with his wife.
[1:38:06] When you see a couple seated like that
[1:38:11] you you feel good and then afterwards
[1:38:13] they begin to separate.
[1:38:17] So Joseph never change that
[1:38:20] unless if you are ministering.
[1:38:23] I'm just looking around to see others.
[1:38:27] You see, you find at FIRST WHEN THEY
[1:38:29] STARTING,
[1:38:30] THEY want to prove everybody will love
[1:38:32] each other
[1:38:34] and then afterwards,
[1:38:36] you know, they they they begin to
[1:38:37] separate.
[1:38:40] One sits here and another one there.
[1:38:43] Couples, always sit together.
[1:38:47] Let me encourage that.
[1:38:50] It's a beautiful thing. Is it not
[1:38:52] church?
[1:38:54] Amen. Amen. The couples did not say
[1:38:56] amen.
[1:39:01] I know I may forget this. I know we have
[1:39:03] already read the scripture. But let me
[1:39:04] also read this before we get into the
[1:39:10] weddings, marriages, weddings,
[1:39:12] marriages.
[1:39:14] This is a season that the church is
[1:39:16] going through.
[1:39:18] So this is an introduction uh
[1:39:20] invitation.
[1:39:24] Um,
[1:39:26] I'm not going to read all the details,
[1:39:30] but I'm simply going to say
[1:39:32] this is what brother Emmanuel told us
[1:39:36] on on um on Sunday, last Sunday. So,
[1:39:41] brother Emanuel and Sister Ruth
[1:39:45] inviting the entire DVF family
[1:39:49] because their parents are inviting us,
[1:39:52] but we know them. So, that's why I'm
[1:39:56] um to this ceremony scheduled on 13th
[1:39:58] December
[1:40:03] in Toro.
[1:40:05] So you must love them to go
[1:40:09] and we all love them don't we?
[1:40:13] So uh I know on the same date
[1:40:17] sister Martha is having a function for
[1:40:19] his daughter for her daughter
[1:40:23] which is here in Kala. For those who
[1:40:25] don't who will not manage this one
[1:40:28] at least you should come to the one of
[1:40:29] sister
[1:40:31] because we shall have on each uh
[1:40:34] ceremonies we're going to be given a
[1:40:35] slot to minister the word.
[1:40:40] Um
[1:40:42] um let me ask brother Emanuel and sister
[1:40:44] Ruth to stand up so those of you who
[1:40:45] don't know them can see them
[1:40:49] brother God bless you
[1:40:52] Ruth God bless you so
[1:40:55] amen so that is 13th December
[1:41:00] it's a busy season
[1:41:05] uh how many were blessed by the service
[1:41:06] on Sunday
[1:41:09] now if you missed it like the ones who
[1:41:11] were on the moon
[1:41:14] and others who were not here,
[1:41:17] please go back and listen. I really
[1:41:21] encourage you to go back and listen
[1:41:24] um this morning
[1:41:27] uh maybe for a while. I'm going to just
[1:41:30] uh go to the part two of that.
[1:41:36] Political maneuvers
[1:41:39] that obscure the vision.
[1:41:51] M
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; this is a subject I didn't never when I
[1:41:55] I was done on Sunday I never thought I
[1:41:57] was going to go to part two
[1:42:03] but after the service
[1:42:06] one brother you know brother Andrew
[1:42:08] Glover Andrew Glover interestingly
[1:42:14] sent me a quote
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; which I will actually read for you today
[1:42:20] that was exactly in the line of what I
[1:42:23] was talking about on Sunday
[1:42:26] and that gave me an inspiration to you
[1:42:28] know continue on that thought.
[1:42:32] So I just want us to stay uh you know
[1:42:34] put you know stay in your place.
[1:42:38] If you feel you are about to go out in
[1:42:40] 30 minutes, you better go now
[1:42:45] and then you come back and stay seated
[1:42:48] all through.
[1:42:49] I remember when I first you know came
[1:42:51] into the message
[1:42:53] I was enjoying everything
[1:42:56] and I never from that time I never go
[1:42:58] out when the preacher is still
[1:42:59] preaching.
[1:43:03] When the preacher is still preaching
[1:43:05] I I don't even want to go
[1:43:08] because I I know I will miss something
[1:43:12] even if I go I go maybe when he has just
[1:43:16] finished
[1:43:18] and I run and I come back that's the
[1:43:21] that's the atmosphere we should put in
[1:43:24] the church
[1:43:26] for the for the Holy Spirit if the Holy
[1:43:28] Spirit sees that you are honoring him
[1:43:33] then he will always come
[1:43:36] amen And I'm happy to see brother
[1:43:39] Omoding from Kamoja here.
[1:43:42] God bless you brother
[1:43:44] and all those visiting with us this
[1:43:45] morning.
[1:43:47] The Lord bless you. Also I have Kagaba
[1:43:50] here
[1:43:52] come for the function of brother you
[1:43:53] know
[1:43:56] and uh we are just happy to you know be
[1:43:58] with all of you this morning.
[1:44:02] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:05] um political maneuvers that obscure the
[1:44:07] vision.
[1:44:13] Now we have to we read on we read in
[1:44:17] Exodus on Sunday.
[1:44:20] But this morning we have read from
[1:44:22] Joshua.
[1:44:25] And you notice that the ministry of
[1:44:26] Joshua
[1:44:29] comes after the ministry of Moses.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; And on Sunday we talked about the
[1:44:35] vision.
[1:44:37] And you know we we're talking about the
[1:44:39] vision uh of God
[1:44:42] for the generation
[1:44:45] but also for a place
[1:44:47] also for a season.
[1:44:50] And then we talked about the mission
[1:44:52] and how for that vision to be carried
[1:44:54] out.
[1:44:57] God always raises a man not men a man.
[1:45:02] and he anoints that man
[1:45:05] with the anointing needed
[1:45:09] to fulfill or carry out or bring about
[1:45:11] that vision.
[1:45:16] And so then we talked about the
[1:45:17] different political maneuvers that have
[1:45:19] happened usually happen
[1:45:25] within the congregation,
[1:45:28] within the group, within that same time.
[1:45:32] And you know when they try to do those
[1:45:33] maneuvers,
[1:45:36] it it obscures that vision that God has,
[1:45:42] you know, like not really hinder but
[1:45:44] obscure it or rather try to uh make the
[1:45:47] people not see it clearly
[1:45:54] and often times it is delayed
[1:46:01] you know uh to obscure means something
[1:46:03] that is unclear,
[1:46:07] something that is uncertain.
[1:46:11] So the vision of God is certain.
[1:46:15] Let me put it this way. Bring it to your
[1:46:17] address now. The vision of God for your
[1:46:19] life
[1:46:21] is Satan.
[1:46:25] It is certain. It is certain.
[1:46:27] uh it has to be accomplished
[1:46:30] and God knows it and he knew it before
[1:46:34] he even called it
[1:46:37] and also the vision of God for a
[1:46:40] generation
[1:46:42] for a season
[1:46:44] is not unsure
[1:46:47] is not uncertain.
[1:46:50] It is certain
[1:46:52] but you see these political MANEUVERS
[1:46:57] WILL NOT always be carried out by one
[1:47:00] man.
[1:47:03] God calls one man.
[1:47:05] But you know the devil will send many
[1:47:08] men.
[1:47:10] And these men will be politically
[1:47:12] motivated
[1:47:16] to move against the one man that God has
[1:47:18] raised FOR THE EARTH.
[1:47:22] AND OFTEN times we see that when they
[1:47:24] try to do their political maneuvers
[1:47:29] the vision which was previously SATAN
[1:47:35] becomes obscured.
[1:47:39] You know people begin to be unclear and
[1:47:41] uncertain the direction they are going.
[1:47:48] People begin to doubt.
[1:47:50] People begin to question.
[1:47:53] PEOPLE begin to murmur.
[1:47:56] Confusion comes in the camp.
[1:47:59] And I want to tell you this morning,
[1:48:02] anything that brings uncertaintity,
[1:48:05] anything that brings confusion,
[1:48:08] anything that brings question, doubting,
[1:48:10] QUESTION,
[1:48:13] anything that brings doubt,
[1:48:16] it is NOT OF GOD.
[1:48:19] BECAUSE THE DEVIL USUALLY DOES THAT.
[1:48:23] He always sws a seed of discrepancy.
[1:48:28] He always ss a seed of doubt.
[1:48:31] You know when he came to Eve? HE ASKED
[1:48:34] HER DID GOD say
[1:48:38] did GOD SAY NOW THAT WAS A QUESTION. BUT
[1:48:42] HERE HOW THE DEVIL BROUGHT THE QUESTION.
[1:48:45] DID GOD SAY THAT YOU SHALL NOT eat of
[1:48:48] any fruit in the g of on any tree in the
[1:48:50] garden?
[1:48:53] Let me ask you a question. DID THE DEVIL
[1:48:56] KNOW WHAT God said?
[1:48:59] Answer me. Did the devil know what God
[1:49:02] said?
[1:49:05] But when he came,
[1:49:07] HE CHANGED IT. HE ASKED A question which
[1:49:11] was not meant which was meant to present
[1:49:14] the devil as a believer
[1:49:20] but TO MAKE EVE DOUBT THE WORD
[1:49:26] did God say
[1:49:29] so he knew the devil that God had said
[1:49:32] that we should not eat that you shall
[1:49:34] not eat of any of any tree in the
[1:49:36] garden.
[1:49:39] HE KNEW THERE WERE TREES IN THE GARDEN,
[1:49:43] BUT THERE WAS A TREE THAT were was not
[1:49:46] supposed TO BE EATEN OF.
[1:49:49] And God had not said to them that you
[1:49:51] shall not eat of any tree.
[1:49:55] God had told them, "Eat of ALL TREES,
[1:49:58] BUT OF THIS ONE, DON'T EAT IT." SO NOW
[1:50:03] WHEN THE DEVIL CAME, HE DID NOT say that
[1:50:07] God said that God that God said don't
[1:50:09] eat of any tree.
[1:50:12] He didn't give A STATEMENT.
[1:50:15] HE DIDN'T GIVE an opinion.
[1:50:17] Are you HEARING ME CHURCH?
[1:50:19] OH BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
[1:50:22] this this thought, this revelation,
[1:50:24] inspiration that God gave me,
[1:50:27] I'm sure it will help us
[1:50:31] as a church, as a body of believers to
[1:50:34] really come a step higher,
[1:50:37] you know, so that we can mature in the
[1:50:39] knowledge of the word.
[1:50:42] Because if you know, if you know the
[1:50:44] vision,
[1:50:46] then you are you are halfway there.
[1:50:49] But if the vision is unclear,
[1:50:52] if you don't know where you are going,
[1:50:55] you don't know how long you're going to
[1:50:56] walk.
[1:50:58] You know, you you you may fail to make
[1:51:00] it.
[1:51:02] Many times when I'm driving a long
[1:51:04] journey,
[1:51:06] my children ask me, "DADDY, HOW FAR?
[1:51:09] DADDY, HOW FAR?"
[1:51:12] They'll ask me within every two minutes
[1:51:14] or one minute.
[1:51:17] How far? How far? Until I get tired. I'm
[1:51:22] like, don't worry. We will get there
[1:51:24] soon.
[1:51:26] HOW SOON? HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE? WHY?
[1:51:30] Because they do not they don't have
[1:51:32] access to Google maps.
[1:51:36] So they can't see the VISION
[1:51:40] of where they are going.
[1:51:43] They don't know the vision. So the
[1:51:45] vision to THEM IS OBSCURED.
[1:51:49] AND SO THEY'RE FILLED WITH CONFUSION.
[1:51:52] THEY'RE FILLED WITH ANXIETY.
[1:51:54] THEY'RE FILLED WITH QUESTIONS, WITH
[1:51:57] DOUBTS.
[1:51:58] AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. SO THEY
[1:52:01] KEEP ASKING EVERYBODY.
[1:52:03] IF THEY ASK me and I'm quiet, they will
[1:52:04] ask their mom.
[1:52:06] If their mom is quiet, they will ask
[1:52:08] anybody in the car.
[1:52:10] How long? HOW FAR ARE WE ABOUT TO GET
[1:52:13] THERE? BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? You as an
[1:52:16] adult don't need to throw up tantrums.
[1:52:21] The only thing you need to do if you're
[1:52:24] traveling to Umbara
[1:52:26] and you want TO KNOW HOW FAR IS PULL OUT
[1:52:29] your phone and go to Google Maps
[1:52:33] and just tell Google I'm going to
[1:52:37] give me the vision of the TRIP
[1:52:41] AND GOOGLE WILL TELL YOU HOW MANY
[1:52:44] KILOMETERS
[1:52:46] FROM WHERE YOU ARE TO WHERE you are
[1:52:48] going. GOOGLE WILL TELL YOU HOW LONG IT
[1:52:52] WILL TAKE YOU. GOOGLE WILL TELL YOU EVEN
[1:52:55] WHETHER THERE IS A PROBLEM on the way
[1:52:59] if there is jam,
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; traffic jam.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Do you know Google will tell you?
[1:53:06] Hallelujah.
[1:53:08] you know, many times when I was, you
[1:53:09] know, in Australia and also in Canada,
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; I noticed, you know, the the Google I
[1:53:15] think because I think more people use it
[1:53:17] and all that.
[1:53:20] It warns them of everything.
[1:53:23] These people of course everybody just
[1:53:25] goes and puts and things.
[1:53:27] So when someone sees police,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; they indicate there
[1:53:33] there is police. SO WHEN YOU'RE
[1:53:35] APPROACHING that
[1:53:37] Google will tell you so many people have
[1:53:40] reported there is police.
[1:53:43] So if you are over the limit,
[1:53:46] you will begin to reduce the speed
[1:53:49] because there is police there. They will
[1:53:51] tell you one lane is closed.
[1:53:54] If you YOU JUST DRIVE WITHOUT FOLLOWING
[1:53:57] THE VISION,
[1:53:59] you'll just GO AND RUN INTO a closed
[1:54:01] lane
[1:54:03] and you die. But because you have
[1:54:06] followed THE VISION, YOU WILL SEE IT
[1:54:09] AHEAD.
[1:54:11] YOU CANNOT SEE PHYSICALLY.
[1:54:14] BUT YOU CAN SEE BY EYES OF GOOGLE
[1:54:18] AND they will tell you there is a lane
[1:54:19] closed.
[1:54:21] They will tell you well it is snowing
[1:54:22] ahead
[1:54:25] and the vision is a bit blood.
[1:54:30] So go slow so you reduce. BUT IF YOU
[1:54:33] DON'T HAVE GOOGLE AND YOU'RE JUST
[1:54:35] DRIVING, you will just go there and hit
[1:54:38] other cars.
[1:54:41] So friends, you see WHY IT IS IMPORTANT
[1:54:43] TO HAVE VISION.
[1:54:47] IF YOU DON'T HAVE VISION, YOU WILL
[1:54:49] ALWAYS BE DESTROYED.
[1:54:52] BUT YOU SEE WHEN GOD,
[1:54:54] you know, PRESENTS HIS VISION
[1:54:57] FOR A SEASON, FOR A TIME, FOR A PLACE,
[1:55:02] FOR A PEOPLE, HE ALWAYS RAISES ONE MAN
[1:55:05] [screaming]
[1:55:08] TO BRING ABOUT THAT VISION.
[1:55:12] But the devil always raises many
[1:55:16] like him that WILL BRING DOUBT AND
[1:55:18] QUESTIONS.
[1:55:23] Praise God. And that's how even the
[1:55:26] spirit of gossip works.
[1:55:30] You know a good gossiper.
[1:55:34] Let me for one minute preach to you
[1:55:36] about a good gossiper.
[1:55:40] So that if you want to be a gossiper,
[1:55:41] you can be a good one.
[1:55:47] A good gossiper
[1:55:49] does not give statements.
[1:55:53] No.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Enter into the spirit of what I'm saying
[1:55:56] cuz I've already talked about that.
[1:55:57] Brother, a good gospel doesn't give a
[1:56:00] statement. He says so much but without
[1:56:03] giving his stand.
[1:56:16] So he will come to you and say
[1:56:19] sister Monica
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; what don't you see what is happening in
[1:56:22] the church these days
[1:56:26] you know brothers especially brother so
[1:56:28] and so
[1:56:30] you know they like dozing a lot
[1:56:34] I've been watching them don't you think
[1:56:37] they might be living in sin
[1:56:40] I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO
[1:56:42] YOU think
[1:56:44] they may as they speaking THEY WANT YOU
[1:56:47] TO SAY SOMETHING
[1:56:50] a good GOSPEL ALWAYS WILL PROVOKE YOU TO
[1:56:52] SAY SOMETHING
[1:56:57] did God SAY
[1:57:00] DID GOD SAY
[1:57:02] SO Satan did GOD SAY
[1:57:05] WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M ASKING YOU
[1:57:08] DID GOD SAY
[1:57:10] EVE FELL INTO THE TRAP?
[1:57:13] AND SHE SAID, "OH YEAH, [screaming] GOD
[1:57:15] NEVER SAID THAT." GOD SAY, "WE WILL NOT
[1:57:19] EAT OF ONLY ONE
[1:57:21] TREE AND WILL NOT EVEN TOUCH IT." SO SHE
[1:57:25] FELL INTO THE TRAP BY BEING EXCITED
[1:57:29] AND TALKING HER MIND
[1:57:32] AND SHE went and superseded the word.
[1:57:37] SO NOW A GOSSIPER WILL COME TO PROVOKE
[1:57:40] YOU.
[1:57:42] AND THEN IF YOU ARE ALSO SOMEONE WHO HAS
[1:57:44] A VERY LIGHT MOUTH,
[1:57:49] you will say, "OH YES, BROTHER.
[1:57:52] OH YES, I HAVE ALSO BEEN observing them.
[1:57:56] They have been dozing all the services.
[1:57:58] THEY MUST BE LIVING IN FORNICATION."
[1:58:01] NOW YOU WHEN YOU CAME TO THEM
[1:58:04] YOU DID the the first gospel did not
[1:58:06] tell you they're living in FORNICATION
[1:58:11] but they put words in your mouth
[1:58:12] LITERALLY
[1:58:16] he would tell don't you think THEY'RE
[1:58:17] NOT LIVING THE RIGHT KIND OF LIFE
[1:58:20] AND THEN SAY YEAH I KNEW IT THEY MUST BE
[1:58:23] LIVING IN FORNICATION
[1:58:25] THEN THIS SAME GOSSIPER THE ORIGINAL ONE
[1:58:28] WILL GO BEHIND YOUR BACK AND GO TO THESE
[1:58:32] VERY BROTHERS
[1:58:34] AND TELL THEM, "DO YOU KNOW WHAT BROTHER
[1:58:37] SO AND SO THINKS ABOUT YOU?"
[1:58:40] Can you imagine? HE SAID, "YOU ARE
[1:58:41] LIVING IN FORNICATION."
[1:58:44] AND THEN YOU WHO ALSO DOESN'T HAVE A
[1:58:47] VISION OF YOUR LIFE, you will begin
[1:58:51] boiling
[1:58:53] and then YOU WILL COME TO
[1:58:56] HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT ME LIKE THIS?
[1:58:59] AND THEN YOU WILL ALSO SAY, "NO, I never
[1:59:03] said it. I never SAID IT." BUT YOU
[1:59:06] ACTUALLY SAID IT, BUT ACTUALLY YOU NEVER
[1:59:09] SAID IT BECAUSE THE OTHER PERSON PUT IT
[1:59:12] in your MOUTH
[1:59:15] AND THEN YOU [screaming] WERE TRAPPED AS
[1:59:16] A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES
[1:59:20] AND THEN YOU WILL NOW SAY NO. IT IS THE
[1:59:23] OTHER THE OTHER one who told it who said
[1:59:25] it first
[1:59:27] and then you will. So now let me tell
[1:59:28] YOU THE ONLY WAY OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM
[1:59:31] OF GOSSIP.
[1:59:34] IF SOMEONE TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
[1:59:36] SOMEBODY
[1:59:38] tell them LET ME ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM
[1:59:40] WHEN THEY ARE THERE.
[1:59:44] YOU WILL SEE THE GOSPEL SAYING
[1:59:46] [screaming]
[1:59:49] I don't want you to involve me
[1:59:51] BUT YOU ALREADY INVOLVED. IF YOU DON'T
[1:59:54] WANT TO BE INVOLVED,
[1:59:56] WHY ARE YOU THE ONE SENDING GOSSIP
[1:59:58] EVERYWHERE?
[2:00:02] OH, YOU ARE NOW AWFULLY QUIET. ARE YOU
[2:00:04] GOSSIPERS?
[2:00:06] YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO,
[2:00:08] SAINTS.
[2:00:10] TO KEEP US FOCUSED ON THE VISION.
[2:00:15] AMEN. We must always, you know, uh not
[2:00:18] allow OURSELVES TO BE TRAPPED.
[2:00:22] DON'T ALLOW ANYBODY TO TRAP YOU
[2:00:26] AS A victim of circumstances.
[2:00:30] If they tell you something about brother
[2:00:31] Brian,
[2:00:33] tell them okay for real is like that
[2:00:37] don't let us call brother Brian. We help
[2:00:40] him
[2:00:43] but you in your heart you know you are
[2:00:44] also helping the gospel.
[2:00:50] You see, gossip is a spirit
[2:00:53] and you know the political spirit
[2:00:57] usually uses or thrives on gossip.
[2:01:02] And we saw it on Sunday.
[2:01:05] How these brothers
[2:01:08] and Kora
[2:01:10] put themselves together to go against
[2:01:12] the man of the earth.
[2:01:14] And they said we we have how can is he
[2:01:16] the only one who HEARS FROM GOD?
[2:01:20] HE'S MAKING HIMSELF A PRINCE OVER US.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; And they brought, you know, they they
[2:01:24] began TO SPEAK BIG SWELLING WORDS.
[2:01:27] But but you see, they were politically
[2:01:30] motivated.
[2:01:34] But I want us to first refresh our our
[2:01:36] mind on this vision.
[2:01:40] What is this vision? In Exodus 3:8, he
[2:01:44] says, "I am come down to deliver them
[2:01:48] out of the hand of the Egyptians
[2:01:51] and to bring them up to out of the land
[2:01:55] unto a good land,
[2:01:58] a large land,
[2:02:01] UNTO A LAND FLOWING WITH milk and
[2:02:04] honey."
[2:02:06] Come on, church, say amen to that. And
[2:02:09] to a place of the Canonites,
[2:02:12] SO THE LAND THE VISION IS [screaming]
[2:02:15] GOD WANTED TO TAKE ISRAEL
[2:02:18] AND BRING THEM OUT OF EGYPT
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; AND TAKE THEM TO CANANAN'S FAIR LAND.
[2:02:25] AMEN. And this land is good. This land
[2:02:28] IS LARGE
[2:02:30] IS FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY.
[2:02:33] THAT'S WHY HE SAYS I HAVE GOOD PLANS FOR
[2:02:36] YOU SAY THE LORD.
[2:02:38] PLANS TO PROSPER YOU. PLANS TO GIVE YOU
[2:02:41] A GOOD FUTURE.
[2:02:43] LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
[2:02:45] GOD HAS GOOD PLANS FOR US.
[2:02:48] AMEN. WE ARE KINGS AND PRIESTS.
[2:02:51] WE ARE ORDAINED OF THE LORD TO OVERCOME
[2:02:54] IN THIS GENERATION. WE ARE THE
[2:02:56] OVERCOMERS OUT OF
[2:02:59] WE CANNOT BE DEFEATED. WE ARE THE BRIDE
[2:03:02] OF CHRIST THAT IS IN DESTRUCTIBLE.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. WE ARE INVISIBLE.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; WE ARE POWERFUL. [screaming] WE ARE
[2:03:15] POWERFUL.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; WE ARE FULL OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY
[2:03:18] GHOST.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE WE? WE ARE THE BRIDE of Jesus
[2:03:23] Christ, THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; WE DECIDE UPON THIS ROCK, [screaming] I
[2:03:28] WILL BUILD MY CHURCH. AND THE GATES OF
[2:03:31] HELL,
[2:03:32] WHICH MEANS THE GATES OF HELL ARE
[2:03:34] FIGHTING.
[2:03:36] AMEN. BUT THE GATES [screaming] OF HELL
[2:03:39] AS MUCH AS THEY FIGHTING US,
[2:03:42] THEY CANNOT PREVAIL.
[2:03:45] [screaming]
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CHURCH?
[2:03:48] OH, BE ENCOURAGED in that TO KNOW NO
[2:03:51] MATTER WHAT YOU ARE WRESTLING WITH.
[2:03:54] THE GATES OF HELL shall never prevail.
[2:03:57] YOU MAY BE IN A MARRIAGE WHICH YOU THINK
[2:04:00] IS BECOMING TOXIC.
[2:04:02] DON'T TAKE COUNSEL FROM THE PEOPLE OF
[2:04:04] THE WORLD.
[2:04:07] THE MOMENT YOU GO TO YOUR AUNTIES AND
[2:04:08] [screaming] UNCLES AND BLAH BLAH BLAH
[2:04:10] BLAH, YOU ARE DESTROYING YOURSELF.
[2:04:14] COME BACK TO [screaming] THE LORD
[2:04:17] BECAUSE THE WORD SAYS THE GATES OF HELL
[2:04:20] CANNOT PREVAIL.
[2:04:23] WHICH MEANS FOR YOU TO OVERCOME. AMEN.
[2:04:26] YOU NEED TO BE BUILT UPON THE REVELATION
[2:04:30] of Jesus Christ. Let me tell you
[2:04:32] brothers and sisters, IF ANYTHING
[2:04:34] STARTED WITHIN GOD,
[2:04:39] it is in God and it will be settled IN
[2:04:42] GOD
[2:04:44] BECAUSE THE ALPHA is the omega.
[2:04:48] Amen. Many times MYSELF AND MY WIFE
[2:04:52] WHEN WE HAVE HAD issues in our marriage,
[2:04:55] yes, we have had many of them.
[2:04:58] But you see some many of them we could
[2:05:01] handle ourselves.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; But there are those WHICH WE COULD WE
[2:05:05] FAIL TO HANDLE.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; WE FAILED TO handle them brother
[2:05:08] Matthew. BUT EACH TIME, AMEN. WE WOULD
[2:05:12] GO BACK TO THE [screaming] ONE WHO
[2:05:14] STARTED THIS BECAUSE HE SAID I AM THE
[2:05:17] ALPHA AND I AM THE OMEGA.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; AND I WOULD ALWAYS TELL GOD, IF YOU GAVE
[2:05:22] THIS GIRL TO ME
[2:05:25] AND YOU GAVE THIS BOY [screaming] TO
[2:05:26] HER,
[2:05:27] THIS CANNOT FAIL BECAUSE OF THE LORD.
[2:05:31] AND THEN WE WOULD CALL ON THE WORD. WE
[2:05:34] WILL SANCTION THE POWER OF THE HOLY
[2:05:35] GHOST AND THE WORD NEVER FAILS. BUT WHAT
[2:05:39] TOLD US THE WORD OF GOD WILL NEVER FAIL
[2:05:43] IN ANY SITUATION, IN ANY PLACE, AT ANY
[2:05:46] TIME. WHEN YOU APPLY THAT WORD
[2:05:50] IT CAN NEVER FAIL.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; BUT THE PROBLEM OF IT, PEOPLE GO TO SEEK
[2:05:55] POLITICAL ADVICE.
[2:06:00] ANYONE WHO IS NOT ANOINTED BY THE SPIRIT
[2:06:02] OF GOD,
[2:06:05] THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS TO COUNEL YOU ON
[2:06:06] THE THINGS THAT ARE SPIRITUAL.
[2:06:11] THAT'S WHY [screaming] WE HAVE A COLD
[2:06:13] CHURCH
[2:06:16] IN THIS END TIME.
[2:06:18] THE BIBLE SAY THEY'RE CALLED
[2:06:20] YOU KNOW THEY ARE LUKEWARM. WHY? BECAUSE
[2:06:23] YOU KNOW THEY HAVE LEFT THE COUNSEL OF
[2:06:25] GOD
[2:06:27] THE COUNCIL OF HIS WORD
[2:06:30] AND THEY HAVE GONE into the world to
[2:06:31] seek for counsel.
[2:06:33] Friends I DON'T KNOW YOUR LIVES how you
[2:06:35] live EVERY DAY
[2:06:38] WHAT I'M SPEAKING NOW IS THE ANSWER TO
[2:06:41] YOUR PRAYERS BECAUSE YOU SAY LORD SPEAK
[2:06:44] TO ME.
[2:06:45] GOD IS SPEAKING TO YOU ACCORDING TO YOUR
[2:06:47] NEED.
[2:06:50] Praise God. Amen. AMEN. I'LL BRING THEM
[2:06:55] [screaming] OUT OF OF THIS LAND AND I'LL
[2:06:57] TAKE THEM TO A GOOD LAND, TO A LARGE
[2:07:00] LAND. GOD [screaming] HAS NO HAS NO
[2:07:04] intention
[2:07:06] of taking you to a bad place.
[2:07:10] GOD HAS NO INTENTION OF MAKING YOU POOR.
[2:07:14] [screaming] GOD HAS NO INTENTION OF
[2:07:17] MAKING YOU SAD, OF MAKING YOU
[2:07:19] BROKENHEARTED.
[2:07:21] GOD HAS NO INTENTION OF TAKING YOU TO A
[2:07:24] SQUEEZY PLACE. THE INTENTION OF GOD IS
[2:07:28] THE CAUSE, THE VISION. IT IS TO BRING
[2:07:31] [screaming] YOU TO A LAND THAT IS GOOD,
[2:07:35] A LAND THAT IS LARGE, A LAND [screaming]
[2:07:39] THAT IS FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY.
[2:07:44] WHAT IS THIS LAND? Later we will see IT
[2:07:46] IS THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:07:50] It's the LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST. IS THE
[2:07:52] LAND OF THE [screaming] WORD
[2:07:54] BUT ALSO IT IS BOTH PHYSICAL AND
[2:07:57] SPIRITUAL IN HIM.
[2:08:00] AMEN. IT IS TALKING ABOUT THE PLAN AND
[2:08:03] THE PURPOSE OF [screaming] GOD FOR YOU.
[2:08:08] GOD DEALS WITH ISRAEL
[2:08:10] AS A NATION. HE DEALS WITH GENTILES AS
[2:08:14] INDIVIDUALS. HE'S BRINGING ISRAEL
[2:08:16] [screaming]
[2:08:18] TO A PHYSICAL LAND. BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
[2:08:21] HE'S BRINGING YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL
[2:08:24] INTO A A PLACE, A PLACE OF VICTORY,
[2:08:29] A PLACE OF HAPPINESS,
[2:08:31] A PLACE THAT IS GOOD.
[2:08:36] WE CAN SAY I'M TIRED OF BAD. LET ME TELL
[2:08:39] YOU
[2:08:41] BELIEVERS. YOU MUST GET TIRED OF
[2:08:46] the good. THERE ARE EVEN SOME PEOPLE WHO
[2:08:48] THINK POVERTY [screaming] IS HOLINESS.
[2:08:52] IF YOU HAVE NO JOB, YOU'RE SPIRITUAL.
[2:08:55] BROTHER SISTER, YOU HAVE TO SAY NO.
[2:08:58] [screaming]
[2:08:59] NO. GOD DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU TO
[2:09:02] LIVE SORRY.
[2:09:05] TO YOU WHO ARE IN VACATIONS,
[2:09:08] BEGIN TO THINK AND BE.
[2:09:10] WHAT AM I GOING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THIS
[2:09:12] VACATION
[2:09:14] BOTH for the Lord AND FOR MY PROGRESS in
[2:09:17] life?
[2:09:19] You must be blessed [snorts]
[2:09:21] AND YOU MUST BE A BLESSING BECAUSE GOD
[2:09:24] IS BRINGING YOU TO A LAND
[2:09:26] THAT IS GOOD AND LARGE.
[2:09:29] I SAID GOOD AND LARGE,
[2:09:31] A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY.
[2:09:34] EVEN AS DVF,
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THAT LITTLE PLACE WE ARE BUYING
[2:09:37] THERE.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; OH, I CAN PROPHESY TO YOU AND I TELL
[2:09:41] YOU, WE SHALL HAVE THAT ENTIRE BLOCK.
[2:09:47] THE DEVIL IS SEEING US HERE
[2:09:52] IN SOMEONE'S BUILDING. AND WHEN WE SPEAK
[2:09:55] THIS, HE THINKS WE ARE JOKING.
[2:10:01] WHEN MOSES SPOKE TO PHARAOH,
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; PHARAOH THOUGHT MOSES WAS JOKING.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT JOKERS.
[2:10:12] [screaming]
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT JOKERS.
[2:10:14] JUST WATCH THIS SPACE AND SEE.
[2:10:18] I SAID IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, WE ARE
[2:10:20] GOING TO OWN all that block. [screaming]
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; YES SIR. FOR WHAT? NOT FOR OURSELVES.
[2:10:29] FOR THE WORK OF GOD.
[2:10:33] AMEN. A LAND THAT [screaming] IS GOOD
[2:10:35] AND LARGE. NOT ONE PLOT, NOT TWO PLOTS,
[2:10:40] LARGE. EVERYBODY SAY LARGE.
[2:10:43] LARGE.
[2:10:45] IF YOU HAVE ONE PLOT,
[2:10:49] BELIEVE FOR ANOTHER ONE. IF YOU HAVE
[2:10:52] TWO, BELIEVE FOR FOUR.
[2:10:55] WHATEVER YOU HAVE, BELIEVE FOR MORE
[2:10:58] BECAUSE OUR GOD IS A GOD OF MORE
[2:11:00] [screaming] AND MORE AND MORE.
[2:11:03] THERE IS MORE IN HIM. WE WILL NOT SETTLE
[2:11:07] FOR LESS.
[2:11:09] IF YOU HAVE ONE CHILD, BELIEVE FOR TWO.
[2:11:13] IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CHILD, BELIEVE FOR
[2:11:16] ONE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WIFE,
[2:11:18] [screaming]
[2:11:19] BELIEVE FOR ONE. OUR GOD IS A GOD OF
[2:11:23] MULTIPLICATION.
[2:11:24] [screaming]
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE'S BRINGING US TO A LAND
[2:11:32] THAT A PLACE OF CANONITES,
[2:11:34] HITTITES, AMORITES,
[2:11:37] and Jeepites. Now, I want YOU TO IMAGINE
[2:11:41] THE vision was to BRING THEM TO SUCH A
[2:11:44] PLACE,
[2:11:45] GOOD and large, strong with milk and
[2:11:48] honey. BUT THE PLACE was filled with the
[2:11:51] adversary.
[2:11:54] Amen.
[2:11:56] Your promise FROM GOD,
[2:11:59] the vision GOD HAS FOR YOU,
[2:12:02] HE SHOULD BRING YOU TO SUCH A PLACE I'VE
[2:12:03] talked about.
[2:12:07] If you're living A LIFE OF SIN,
[2:12:10] HE WANTS TO TAKE YOU OUT OF IT AND TO
[2:12:12] MAKE YOU HOLY AND TO MAKE YOU PERFECT
[2:12:17] AND TO MAKE YOU AN AMBASSADOR
[2:12:19] OF THE KINGDOM ON EARTH.
[2:12:22] BUT YOU SEE THIS PLACE IN CHRIST
[2:12:26] IS NOT EASY TO GET INTO.
[2:12:28] WHY DOES it
[2:12:31] man REVELATION IS FLOWING?
[2:12:34] WHY DOES IT SEEM AS IF YOU ARE FIGHTING
[2:12:37] EVERY DAY?
[2:12:41] AMEN. YOU DON'T WANT TO LIE. YOU FIND
[2:12:44] YOURSELF LYING. YOU DON'T WANT TO LAUGH.
[2:12:47] YOU CUT YOURSELF. YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
[2:12:49] THIS. YOU FIND YOURSELF. WHY ARE YOU
[2:12:52] FIGHTING? FIGHTING. IT SEEMS AS IF
[2:12:54] YOU'RE FIGHTING YOURSELF
[2:12:57] BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS HOLDING YOUR LAND.
[2:13:02] AMEN. AMEN.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; THE CANONITES ARE STILL THERE. THE ARE
[2:13:06] STILL THERE. THE ARE STILL THERE.
[2:13:09] BUT I HAVE A WORD FROM THE LORD THIS
[2:13:11] MORNING. THE HEATERS MUST DIE.
[2:13:15] THE MUST DIE. THE AMORITES MUST DIE. THE
[2:13:20] MUST DIE.
[2:13:22] MUST DIE. [screaming]
[2:13:23] THE LAND IS OURS. I SAID THE LAND IS
[2:13:26] YOURS.
[2:13:28] WHATEVER GOD EVER REDEMPTIVE PROMISE IN
[2:13:32] HIS WORD
[2:13:34] IS YOURS. I SAID IS YOURS. [screaming]
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; DON'T LOOK AT ME JUST SAY
[2:13:41] IT IS YOURS. EVERY PROMISE HE HAS GIVEN
[2:13:43] IN HIS WORD
[2:13:45] BELONGS TO ME AND MY FAMILY.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And amen.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; So he promised Israel.
[2:13:55] and I'm going to take you to this land.
[2:13:58] SO THAT MEANS GOD ENVISIONED
[2:14:01] THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE OUT.
[2:14:05] [laughter]
[2:14:06] AMEN. THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND
[2:14:10] AND TO POSSESS IT. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS
[2:14:13] TO possess
[2:14:15] because someone IS POSSESSING IT.
[2:14:18] BUT YOU MUST POSSESS.
[2:14:20] YOU CAN'T POSSESS WITHOUT FIGHTING. AND
[2:14:24] TO FIGHT YOU WILL OVERCOME BECAUSE THERE
[2:14:27] IS A PROMISE ON YOUR HEAD THAT YOU ARE
[2:14:29] AN OVERCOMER.
[2:14:31] AMEN.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY SAY I MUST POSSESS.
[2:14:35] I MUST POSSESS. I MUST POSSESS. AM I
[2:14:39] PREACHING TO PENTECOSTALS? I MUST
[2:14:41] POSSESS. I MUST POSSESS.
[2:14:44] AMEN.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS IS THE TYPE OF THE
[2:14:47] VISION
[2:14:49] [screaming] GOD HAS FOR the New
[2:14:50] Testament church
[2:14:53] today. THE TRUE CHURCH I SAID MUST
[2:14:56] POSSESS
[2:14:58] EVERY REDEMPTIVE PROMISE
[2:15:02] of God in this hour.
[2:15:05] WE MUST DRIVE OUT
[2:15:07] EVERY ENEMY OUT OF OUR LAND.
[2:15:12] AMEN.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; We must DRIVE THEM OUT. SOME OF YOU ARE
[2:15:15] FIGHTING A HARDER BATTLE.
[2:15:19] It means your portion is bigger.
[2:15:23] [cheering] God bless you, brother
[2:15:24] Martin.
[2:15:28] BROTHER MARTIN, DO YOU WANT A PROPHECY?
[2:15:32] JESUS CAME FROM HEAVEN FOR YOU. YOUR
[2:15:34] PORTION is bigger.
[2:15:37] YOUR PORTION IS BIGGER.
[2:15:40] THE DEVIL IS FIGHTING YOU BIG
[2:15:42] BECAUSE HE KNOWS. [screaming]
[2:15:44] AMEN. YOUR PORTION IS BIGGER. SO HE'S
[2:15:47] BRINGING A BIGGER FIGHT.
[2:15:50] AMEN. BUT LET [screaming] ME TELL YOU,
[2:15:52] HE THAT IS IN US IS GREATER THAN HE THAT
[2:15:55] IS IN THE WORLD.
[2:15:57] WE MUST OVERCOME THIS. WE MUST POSSESS
[2:16:00] EVERY PIECE OF OUR LAND.
[2:16:03] SEE HOW ISRAEL
[2:16:05] REGARDLESS OF WHAT AMERICA SAY DURING
[2:16:09] during you know Biden and all others
[2:16:12] YOU KNOW THEY WERE NOT EVEN WERE
[2:16:13] THREATENING TO PULL OUT
[2:16:16] BUT YOU KNOW THIS prime minister of
[2:16:17] Israel came
[2:16:19] this a political Israel really
[2:16:22] but he still gives US THE PICTURE THEN
[2:16:25] HE CAME UP AND HE SAID HE GAVE A
[2:16:28] STATEMENT HE SAID REGARDLESS OF WHO IS
[2:16:31] STANDING WITH US.
[2:16:35] We [screaming] are GOING TO FIGHT.
[2:16:38] AND THEY DIDN'T SAY THEY'RE GOING TO
[2:16:39] DIE,
[2:16:40] BUT THEY SAID WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY
[2:16:44] EVERY ONE [screaming] OF OUR ENEMIES.
[2:16:47] WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY.
[2:16:50] AMEN. THE THE THE THE WAR UH YOU KNOW
[2:16:53] THE YOU KNOW ALL THESE enemies that ARE
[2:16:54] IN GAZA.
[2:16:57] IMAGINE AT THE SAME TIME
[2:16:59] SEVERAL TIME SEVERAL TIMES
[2:17:02] ISRAEL HAS FOUGHT A BATTLE A war
[2:17:06] and MANY ADVERSARIES AT THE SAME TIME
[2:17:12] has brought US FROM THIS SIDE
[2:17:15] FROM THIS SIDE. I RAN FROM THIS AND all
[2:17:18] of them, you know, SHOOTING AT THEM. AND
[2:17:21] ISRAEL, IF YOU SEE IT ON THE MAP, IT IS
[2:17:24] ONE LITTLE STRIP OF LAND.
[2:17:26] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE IS A BIG
[2:17:28] PROMISE BEHIND THEM.
[2:17:31] WHEN WHEN THEY ASKED THEM, "WHERE IS
[2:17:34] YOUR LAND?" THEY SAID, "OUR LAND IS IN
[2:17:36] PALESTINE."
[2:17:38] AND AT ONE TIME THEY TOLD THEM, "WELL,
[2:17:40] GO AND SETTLE IN UGANDA."
[2:17:43] THEY WANTED THEM TO SETTLE HERE.
[2:17:45] BUT HE SAID, "NO, WE [screaming] KNOW
[2:17:48] WHERE OUR LAND IS. GOD PROMISED US THIS
[2:17:52] PIECE OF LAND AND IT IS OURS." AND AMEN.
[2:17:57] THERE WERE PEOPLE THERE ALREADY.
[2:17:59] BUT YOU KNOW, FOR ALL THESE CENTURIES,
[2:18:03] ISRAEL HAS FOUGHT WARS AND BATTLES. WARS
[2:18:05] AND BATTLES. BUT IN EACH OF THEM, THEY
[2:18:08] HAVE BEEN MORE THAN CONQUERORS. WHY?
[2:18:11] THERE IS A PROMISE BEHIND THAT NATION.
[2:18:14] I CAN TELL YOU BROTHER SISTER WE ARE
[2:18:16] MORE SPECIAL THAN ISRAEL.
[2:18:18] THE BIBLE SAYS WE ARE HOLY NATION. WE
[2:18:22] ARE ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. WE ARE HERE TO
[2:18:26] FIGHT ALSO LIKE [screaming] ISRAEL. WE
[2:18:28] MUST OVERCOME EVERY ONE OF OUR ENEMIES.
[2:18:32] WE MUST POSSESS EVERY PIECE OF GROUND
[2:18:35] THAT GOD [screaming] PROMISED US.
[2:18:38] REGARDLESS
[2:18:39] OF WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING AGAINST US, WE
[2:18:43] DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAYING. WE DON'T
[2:18:45] CARE WHAT THEY SAYING BECAUSE WE HAVE
[2:18:47] SOMEONE THAT IS BIGGER THAN ANY NATION
[2:18:51] BACKING [screaming] US.
[2:18:54] SOMEONE BIGGER THAN AMERICA,
[2:18:56] SOMEONE BIGGER THAN RUSSIA.
[2:18:58] [screaming] AMEN. AMEN. SOMEONE CALLED
[2:19:00] JESUS IS BEHIND THE BRIDE.
[2:19:05] IF YOU can receive a revelation
[2:19:08] IS STANDING WITH YOU THEN YOU WILL KNOW
[2:19:12] EVEN IN YOUR POVERTY YOU CAN overcome
[2:19:15] even in your PROBLEMS IN YOUR MARRIAGE
[2:19:17] YOU CAN BREAK OUT OF IT YOU CAN KNOW
[2:19:20] EVEN IN THINGS WHICH YOU THOUGHT NO ONE
[2:19:23] CAN SOLVE GOD IS ABLE TO SOLVE THEM STOP
[2:19:27] HANDLING THINGS MECHANICALLY
[2:19:31] ENTER INTO THE SPIRIT
[2:19:33] AMEN AMEN. AND THEN FOCUS ON THE VISION
[2:19:37] THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN THIS HOUR.
[2:19:39] THE VISION OF THIS HOUR IS CHRIST.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; CHRIST. EVERYBODY SAY CHRIST.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; BUT WE KNOW CHRIST WAS IN JESUS.
[2:19:49] BUT TODAY THAT SAME [screaming] CHRIST
[2:19:52] IS IN YOU AND I.
[2:19:55] [cheering]
[2:19:55] [applause]
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; The God explain says your loving arms
[2:20:00] around every man and every woman and may
[2:20:02] our vision OUR
[2:20:05] VISION, our sight MAY BE RAISED HIGHER
[2:20:10] AND HIGHER
[2:20:14] than the THINGS OF THE WORLD THAT WE MAY
[2:20:17] SEEK CHRIST.
[2:20:20] SEE NOTHING, HEAR NOTHING WRONG. HEAR
[2:20:22] NOTHING WRONG. See nothing wrong. SPEAK
[2:20:25] NOTHING WRONG. SEEK CHRIST IN YOUR
[2:20:27] BROTHER. AND BROTHER PRAYS AND HE SAYS,
[2:20:30] "LORD, MAY OUR VISION GO HIGHER AND
[2:20:34] HIGHER AND HIGHER THAT WE MAY SEE
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; AND OTHERS MAY SEE CHRIST IN US."
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; I SAY HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF THIS GENERATION SAID HIS
[2:20:49] ONLY GOD, his only cause,
[2:20:53] HIS ONLY VISION
[2:20:55] WOULD BE TO SEE THE PEOPLE RESTORED
[2:20:57] BACK.
[2:20:59] THAT relationship
[2:21:02] with God. SEE, IT'S ALL ABOUT CHRIST.
[2:21:08] Brother Shalom sang a song. It's all
[2:21:10] about you, Jesus.
[2:21:13] You didn't even know what I was
[2:21:14] preaching about this morning.
[2:21:16] YES. IT'S ALL ABOUT CHRIST.
[2:21:19] CHRIST IS OUR VISION.
[2:21:21] Can you tell your neighbor Christ is our
[2:21:22] vision?
[2:21:25] Amen. Oh hallelujah.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; In resume of agency he says let me quote
[2:21:31] that for you.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; We believe brother Bham
[2:21:37] to be the prophet of this hour.
[2:21:39] We always quote his messages
[2:21:42] but many people don't know why because
[2:21:46] brother Bham is a prophet to this age.
[2:21:50] He is a man that God gave the vision
[2:21:53] for the bride of the last day.
[2:21:58] Your amens are very weak.
[2:22:02] [panting]
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Do you feel good, brother Henry?
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; What do you Why do you think you're
[2:22:11] feeling good?
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Because the anointing of God,
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; the stimulation of revelation.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you're feeling good.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to begin absorbing now.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; brother. There are seven angels to the
[2:22:26] seven churches. To every church, to
[2:22:29] every church
[2:22:31] there is an angel which is a prophet
[2:22:34] messenger. AND THAT PROPHET MESSENGER
[2:22:37] HAD A VISION
[2:22:39] FOR THAT AGE.
[2:22:42] Some people you know they see we always
[2:22:44] told talk to them and they see Elijah
[2:22:46] the first Elijah
[2:22:48] quickly. Then they see Elisha he was
[2:22:51] Elijah. Then they see John THE BAPTIST.
[2:22:54] ELIJAH. THEN WHEN IT COMES TO OUR DAY,
[2:22:57] THEY SAID, "NO, NO, NO. It's the Holy
[2:22:59] Spirit upon many people."
[2:23:03] He say, "Sorry,
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; sorry for them.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; They don't understand it. They don't
[2:23:08] understand it." If God
[2:23:11] send the spirit of Elijah on one man,
[2:23:15] why would he in the end time send upon
[2:23:18] many?
[2:23:21] Even in our age, he sent it to one man
[2:23:28] in our generation. One man to the whole
[2:23:31] world.
[2:23:33] But remember brothers and sisters, this
[2:23:35] Elijah
[2:23:37] is not the first prophet to come. He
[2:23:40] would be the last messenger
[2:23:42] to the last age. AND THE OTHERS FROM THE
[2:23:45] FIRST AGE, SECOND BOOK,
[2:23:49] ALL of them
[2:23:51] WE ARE STANDING
[2:23:53] AS HOLDERS OF THE VISION
[2:23:56] OF THE BRIDE IN THEIR AGE.
[2:24:00] [screaming] SO WILLIAM BRHAM
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; IS CARRYING THE VISION FOR OUR AGE.
[2:24:06] THAT'S WHY WE QUOTE HIM A LOT
[2:24:09] BECAUSE HE'S OUR PASTOR IN THAT SENSE.
[2:24:15] Your amens ARE VERY WEAK
[2:24:18] IN THAT SENSE. WILLIAM BRANDHAM IS THE
[2:24:21] PASTOR OF THE LAST AGE. WHY? BECAUSE THE
[2:24:24] PASTOR THE PASTOR IS THE VISION BEARER
[2:24:30] OF THE CHURCH AND EVERY CHURCH IS
[2:24:33] SOVEREIGN.
[2:24:36] I KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS WHO USE THAT IN
[2:24:37] THE WRONG SENSE
[2:24:41] SAY OH YEAH BECAUSE OF THAT WE NEED TO
[2:24:42] LISTEN TO ONLY WILLIAM BRHAM.
[2:24:46] WE ARE FAILING TO UNDERSTAND
[2:24:48] THAT EVEN REDEMPTION
[2:24:50] HAS SEASONS.
[2:24:52] WE ARE IN ANOTHER [screaming] SEASON
[2:24:53] NOW. AMEN. AND EVERY SEASON, GOD USES
[2:24:57] MEN
[2:24:59] AND FOR A GENERATION.
[2:25:01] GOD HAS SENT US A PROPHET AND GOD TAKES
[2:25:04] MEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD AND
[2:25:08] HE ANOINTS THEM TO BREAK DOWN THAT BREAD
[2:25:12] TO THE CHILDREN IN EVERY PLACE
[2:25:15] IN EVERY NATION IN EVERY TOWN. AMEN. I
[2:25:20] SAID AMEN. [screaming]
[2:25:22] IF GOD WOULD CALL A MAN TO PREACH AND HE
[2:25:26] CALLS OTHERS TO LISTEN TO TAPES ONLY,
[2:25:30] THEN HE'S NOT A FAIR GOD.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; THEN HE IS NOT A FAIR GOD.
[2:25:42] GOD AT EVERY TIME HE WILL RAISE A MAN TO
[2:25:45] PREACH.
[2:25:46] AMEN. [screaming]
[2:25:47] HE RAISED PAUL AND PAUL PREACHED THE
[2:25:50] MESSAGE AND PAUL SAID IF ANY MAN
[2:25:53] [screaming]
[2:25:54] EVEN IF HE'S AN ANGEL HE COMES DOWN AND
[2:25:56] PREACHES ANOTHER GOSPEL LET HIM BE A
[2:26:00] [screaming]
[2:26:00] DIFFERENT GOSPEL AND THEN WILLIAM CAME
[2:26:04] AND HE SAID HALLELUJAH I PREACH WHAT
[2:26:08] PREACH
[2:26:10] AMEN HE DID NOT PLAY [screaming] PAUL
[2:26:13] STEP ONLY.
[2:26:17] HALLELUJAH.
[2:26:19] BUT HE PREACHED.
[2:26:21] AMEN. WHAT PREACH
[2:26:25] WE ARE PREACHING WHAT WILLIAM PREACHED
[2:26:29] ON THE TAPE. WE ARE NOT SAYING ANYTHING
[2:26:31] DIFFERENT.
[2:26:33] It's the same Holy Spirit. [screaming]
[2:26:39] [cheering]
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we shy away
[2:26:45] from dealing with those things.
[2:26:47] But then you need to know you need to
[2:26:50] rightly divide the word.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:57] And if you're streaming and you're
[2:26:58] offended by that, I'm speaking to my
[2:26:59] local congregation.
[2:27:04] AND HERE THIS
[2:27:07] NOW GIVES A disclaimer
[2:27:10] in the regime of ages. I sincerely
[2:27:13] believe
[2:27:15] that THE SPIRIT OF GOD, PUT IT UP HERE,
[2:27:16] THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[2:27:19] HAS BEEN SPEAKING to us
[2:27:21] is meaning through his ministry.
[2:27:24] AMEN. AMEN.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY TEACHING US THE TRUTH
[2:27:29] OF THE AGES,
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; BUT HE HAS BEEN FAITHFULLY DEALING WITH
[2:27:33] [screaming] HEARTS,
[2:27:36] that they may turn to him.
[2:27:40] THAT IS THE REASON FOR ALL PREACHING
[2:27:44] AND TEACHING.
[2:27:46] FOR IT IS THE PREACHING AND TEACHING OF
[2:27:48] THE WORD,
[2:27:50] THAT THE SHEEP HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD AND
[2:27:52] [screaming]
[2:27:56] AND THEN NOW HE SAYS, "NOT FOR ONE
[2:27:57] MOMENT
[2:27:59] DO I BRING A MESSAGE to the people."
[2:28:03] THAT THEY MAY FOLLOW ME.
[2:28:05] AMEN. WE ARE NOT FOLLOWERS OF WILLIAM.
[2:28:09] THAT IS NOT A PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE.
[2:28:12] THAT'S NOT THE VISION OF THE MESSAGE.
[2:28:15] HEAR WHAT BROTHER BON HIMSELF SAID. I
[2:28:18] DIDN'T BRING THE MESSAGE THAT THE PEOPLE
[2:28:20] MAY JOIN MY CHURCH.
[2:28:23] WE ARE NOT HERE TO START A BRAND.
[2:28:26] NO SIR [screaming]
[2:28:28] OR START SOME FELLOWSHIP
[2:28:30] AND ORGANIZATION.
[2:28:32] THIS MESSAGE DID NOT COME SO THAT WE
[2:28:35] HAVE DAYS OF THE VOICE FELLOWSHIP SO
[2:28:38] THAT WE HAVE A BIG CHURCH. THAT IS NOT A
[2:28:40] PURPOSE. THAT'S NOT [screaming] A
[2:28:42] VISION.
[2:28:45] I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT. AND I WON'T DO
[2:28:47] THAT NOW. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE
[2:28:50] THINGS. BUT I HAVE INTERESTED THE THINGS
[2:28:52] OF GOD
[2:28:54] AND THE PEOPLE. AND IF I CAN ACCOMPLISH
[2:28:58] JUST ONE THING,
[2:29:00] JUST ONE THING,
[2:29:03] JUST ONE THING,
[2:29:05] NOT TWO, NOT THREE, NOT FOUR,
[2:29:08] [screaming] ONE THING I WILL BE
[2:29:11] SATISFIED.
[2:29:14] ASK YOUR NEIGHBOR, WHAT IS THAT ONE
[2:29:17] THING?
[2:29:19] THAT ONE THING IS TO SEE ESTABLISHED
[2:29:24] A TRUE [screaming] RELATIONSHIP
[2:29:27] BETWEEN GOD AND
[2:29:32] [screaming]
[2:29:33] AMEN.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; THE PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE
[2:29:36] IS TO RESTORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
[2:29:40] GOD AND MAN.
[2:29:42] AMEN. AMEN. WHEREIN MEN BECOME NEW
[2:29:45] CREATIONS IN CHRIST
[2:29:48] FILLED WITH THEIR SPIRIT
[2:29:50] FILLED WITH [screaming] THEIR SPIRIT.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; AND LIVE ACCORDING TO HIS WORD.
[2:29:59] I would invite everyone
[2:30:02] and plead and want all to hear his VOICE
[2:30:06] AT THIS TIME AND YIELD YOUR lives
[2:30:10] completely TO HIM.
[2:30:13] EVEN as I TRUST IN MY HEART, I HAVE
[2:30:15] GIVEN MY ALL TO HIM.
[2:30:18] GOD BLESS YOU AND may his coming.
[2:30:22] He did not SAY IF HE COMES. HE SAID HE
[2:30:25] IS COMING BECAUSE HE KNOWS if this
[2:30:29] relationship IS BREACHED AGAIN JESUS
[2:30:32] MUST COME.
[2:30:35] BEHOLD I SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET
[2:30:37] BEFORE [screaming]
[2:30:39] THE COMING OF THE LORD. AMEN. I JUST
[2:30:42] THERE. LET ME TELL YOU AFTER ELIJAH
[2:30:45] COMES. AMEN. Then the MESSIAH COMES. MAY
[2:30:49] HE'S COMING REJOICE YOUR HEART. WHY?
[2:30:53] BECAUSE ELIJAH'S COME. BECAUSE ELIJAH IS
[2:30:56] COMING, THE MESSIAH MUST COME. BECAUSE
[2:30:59] ELIJAH IS [screaming] COMING. CHRIST IS
[2:31:01] HERE.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; HE IS NOT COMING ONLY. HE IS [screaming]
[2:31:06] HERE. WHERE IS HE? HE'S IN ME. SEE
[2:31:10] CHRIST IN ME.
[2:31:13] SEE CHRIST IN YOUR BROTHER.
[2:31:15] CHRIST IS HERE IN THE FORM of the bride.
[2:31:19] So this message is not to promote a man.
[2:31:23] IT IS TO PROMOTE CHRIST. EVERYBODY SAID
[2:31:26] CHRIST.
[2:31:28] CHRIST. THIS WILL QUICKEN OUR MORTAL
[2:31:32] BODIES. THIS WILL RENEW OUR MINDS. THIS
[2:31:36] WILL TAKE US IN OUR FUTURE HOME.
[2:31:39] LET US THEREFORE PREACH THIS MESSAGE.
[2:31:42] ALWAYS POINTING [screaming]
[2:31:43] PEOPLE TO CHRIST.
[2:31:49] OUR CAUSE, OUR GOAL, OUR VISION IS
[2:31:54] CHRIST, BROTHER.
[2:31:57] THAT'S WHY WE TRANSLATE THE MESSAGE.
[2:32:00] THAT'S WHY WE PRINT THE MESSAGE.
[2:32:02] THOSE [screaming] STEPS, THOSE BOOKS,
[2:32:05] BROTHER, WHEN YOU EAT IT UP, [screaming]
[2:32:08] WHEN YOU EAT IT UP, SOMETHING IS GOING
[2:32:10] TO HAPPEN AND YOU WILL PROPHESY AGAIN.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. True believers.
[2:32:18] Listen to the message.
[2:32:22] If you don't, you are not you've not yet
[2:32:25] proved who you are.
[2:32:28] If you have no appetite,
[2:32:30] it's like saying you're a human being.
[2:32:32] But you are eating slow stones.
[2:32:36] You've not proved you're a human being.
[2:32:38] Eat food. Have the appetite for food.
[2:32:41] And then I will know WHO YOU ARE.
[2:32:43] BROTHER, ARE YOU FEEDING ON THE WORD?
[2:32:48] BUT THERE ARE MANY men in this hour that
[2:32:50] have risen, amen, with political
[2:32:53] motivations
[2:32:55] and they're doing their maneuvers
[2:32:58] converting the people
[2:33:00] from to a man instead of Christ.
[2:33:04] Amen. We have TWO EXTREMES.
[2:33:07] OTHERS ARE saying William Brham was not
[2:33:10] a prophet of God
[2:33:13] and the message is not true. Those ones,
[2:33:15] even the Pentecostals, they are better
[2:33:16] than them.
[2:33:22] Even the Pentecostals not better.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Who is this man in Zimbabwe who has a
[2:33:28] big following?
[2:33:32] Who but angel?
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; I wanted to say it on the microphone
[2:33:34] here. Someone will go and search it out.
[2:33:38] This man,
[2:33:41] he flows in the prophetic prophesies
[2:33:47] here and there and
[2:33:50] but
[2:33:52] he HAS SAID ON COUNTLESS OCCASIONS
[2:33:56] that William Brham
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; was a prophet of another real
[2:34:04] one of his disciples was asking him
[2:34:08] how do we compare what you're doing with
[2:34:09] what DID
[2:34:14] WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? How can you put
[2:34:16] my name and William on the same on the
[2:34:18] same sentence?
[2:34:22] Is something wrong with you? He was
[2:34:24] speaking to his followers.
[2:34:26] Say William, you can't even put my name
[2:34:28] and his name.
[2:34:32] One brother in Zimbabwe,
[2:34:34] friend of mine, I'll not mention the
[2:34:36] name. He told me,
[2:34:39] you know, he spoke to this brother
[2:34:42] who I also know very well preached for
[2:34:44] him uh in the UK. He's a pastor also
[2:34:49] originally from Zimbabwe.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; He told me he spoke to Wubert Angel
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; and he introduced the message to him and
[2:34:59] and then Wbert asked him a question. He
[2:35:02] said, "Brother," he asked his name. He
[2:35:04] said, "Brother, I have a question for
[2:35:06] you. Who is the message believer?"
[2:35:11] And this brother said, uh, before he
[2:35:14] could answer him, angel pulled out his
[2:35:17] his iPad
[2:35:19] and he scrolled
[2:35:22] and he brought all the sermons of
[2:35:24] brotherham
[2:35:27] and he told him. I read all his
[2:35:30] messages. I listen to all of them and I
[2:35:33] believe all of them. So can you now can
[2:35:35] you believe a message believer then?
[2:35:39] So they believe this message to be the
[2:35:42] but they may not even be in the bride.
[2:35:47] They know I'm talking about the
[2:35:49] Pentecostals. They know that William Br
[2:35:53] was a major prophet.
[2:35:56] HE WAS A VISION BEARER
[2:35:58] IN THIS GENERATION. They know. So that
[2:36:01] EXTREME
[2:36:04] OF PEOPLE WHO ARE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.
[2:36:10] THEY CAME IN A MESSAGE SAT FOR A FEW
[2:36:13] YEARS AND THEN LEFT UNSATISFIED
[2:36:19] and they said the message is not true.
[2:36:22] is because they themselves are confused
[2:36:27] and they don't know the identity. BUT I
[2:36:29] TELL YOU WHAT, WE HAVE ANOTHER EXTREME.
[2:36:33] THESE ARE THE ONES WHO SAY, "WELL,
[2:36:36] WILLIAM BRANDHAM [screaming]
[2:36:37] IS A PROPHET OF THIS HOUSE." THAT'S
[2:36:39] TRUE. BUT THEN THEY SAY HE ALONE IS THE
[2:36:44] ONE WHO MUST PREACH.
[2:36:47] YOU IN YOUR CHURCH, YOUR PASTOR MUST SIT
[2:36:48] DOWN
[2:36:50] AND WE MUST PLAY THE TEMPLE. FOR BROTHER
[2:36:52] BHAM BECAUSE HE ALONE HAS THE GRACE FOR
[2:36:56] THE HOUSE TO PREACH BUT BROTHER BHAM IS
[2:36:59] DEAD FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS
[2:37:03] HE CAN'T PREACH BUT WE CAN PLAY HIS STEP
[2:37:06] AND LISTEN TO IT
[2:37:09] SO you can't tell me that he can preach
[2:37:12] but you can LISTEN TO HIS STEP ARE TWO
[2:37:15] DIFFERENT THINGS
[2:37:20] AND THEY ARE SO DECEIVED
[2:37:23] THAT THEY WILL GO AHEAD TO TO TO EVEN
[2:37:26] PUT YOU KNOW THE TAPE to w them.
[2:37:31] They'll put a TYP
[2:37:43] as if THE GOD 50 YEARS AGO IS NOT ALIVE
[2:37:45] TODAY.
[2:37:49] OTHERS WILL TAKE THE PIT OF FIRE
[2:37:51] PICTURE.
[2:37:53] THEY BAPTIZE SOMEBODY AND THEN THEY PUT
[2:37:56] IT ON THEIR HEAD.
[2:37:58] Oh my brothers and sisters,
[2:38:02] THAT'S [screaming] ANOTHER SIDE.
[2:38:05] THEY LEFT OFF THE LINE.
[2:38:08] BUT BROTHER BAM HIMSELF SHOUTED OUT AND
[2:38:11] HE SAID, "STAY ON THE [screaming] LINE.
[2:38:15] STAY ON THE LINE. DON'T GO TO THE LEFT.
[2:38:19] DON'T GO TO THE RIGHT. [screaming]
[2:38:22] STAY ON THE LINE.
[2:38:24] [cheering]
[2:38:25] HALLELUJAH. SO WE BELIEVE IN PLAYING
[2:38:28] TAPES.
[2:38:30] WE PLAY THEM IN OUR HOMES.
[2:38:33] BY THE WAY, WE CAN EVEN PLAY IT IN THE
[2:38:34] CHURCH.
[2:38:36] IF GOD LEADS US, WE CAN EVEN PLAY IT IN
[2:38:38] THE CHURCH.
[2:38:40] THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.
[2:38:42] WE CAN PLAY BY THE BOTTOM STEP OR ANY
[2:38:46] OTHER PREACHER STEP.
[2:38:48] THAT'S OKAY. BUT WE CANNOT MAKE IT AS A
[2:38:51] STANDARD
[2:38:53] AS A DOCTRINE.
[2:38:55] SAY NO MORE PREACHING ONLY PLAYING
[2:38:58] TAPES.
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters. I am sorry because
[2:39:05] God called me to preach. I am preaching
[2:39:08] my conviction.
[2:39:11] Amen. I AM ANSWERABLE TO THE LORD
[2:39:15] FOR WHAT I SAY. IF YOU DISAGREE,
[2:39:19] YOU CAN also hold your opinion and say
[2:39:20] it when you get a chance to preach.
[2:39:25] BUT BEFORE GOD GIVES YOU A MICROPHONE
[2:39:28] FOR NOW, HEAR WHAT I'M TELLING YOU.
[2:39:33] AMEN. SO LET'S PREACH THIS MESSAGE.
[2:39:36] LET'S BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. LET'S LISTEN
[2:39:38] TO IT. [screaming] LET US READ IT. BUT
[2:39:41] REMEMBER, WE SHOULD ALWAYS POINT PEOPLE
[2:39:44] TO CHRIST. [screaming]
[2:39:48] IN THE NAME OF JESUS, I SAY THAT IS OUR
[2:39:51] GOD.
[2:39:53] That is our cause.
[2:39:56] THAT IS OUR VISION.
[2:39:59] CHRIST IS OUR VISION. BROTHER, CHRIST IS
[2:40:02] OUR GOD.
[2:40:05] [cheering]
[2:40:07] On Sunday, we learn that God assigns a
[2:40:10] man with a mission to project a vision
[2:40:12] to of a generation.
[2:40:18] or to a group of people,
[2:40:21] a vision of a season, time and moment.
[2:40:25] IT MAY SOUND FUNNY, BUT GOD DOES NOT
[2:40:26] SEND A GROUP OF MEN TO PROJECT his
[2:40:28] vision.
[2:40:33] But he sends a man in a generation. He
[2:40:36] sends a man. There are others, BUT ONE
[2:40:39] MAJOR PROPHET. PAUL WAS a major prophet
[2:40:42] but there was Agabas a minor prophet so
[2:40:45] don't not misunderstand me God uses
[2:40:47] others
[2:40:50] vision BEARER [screaming]
[2:40:53] in DVF WE HAVE MANY GOOD PREACHERS
[2:40:57] MAYBE SOME WHO EVEN TO YOU SOME OF YOU
[2:40:59] WHO PREACH BETTER than I do
[2:41:04] AND THAT'S OKAY BY THE WAY DVF IT'S OKAY
[2:41:07] FOR YOU TO HAVE YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER
[2:41:11] AND FOR YOU TO SAY MY pastor is NOT MY
[2:41:13] FAVORITE PREACHER, THAT'S OKAY.
[2:41:21] Let me even go ahead and SAY THIS. IT'S
[2:41:24] OKAY FOR YOU TO HAVE YOUR FAVORITE
[2:41:25] PREACHER NOT BEING YOUR PASTOR
[2:41:32] when he's another preacher, another
[2:41:33] pastor.
[2:41:36] Maybe even here in Kala.
[2:41:39] IT IS OKAY. SOME OF YOU WHO ARE
[2:41:41] RELIGIOUS are now you are having a
[2:41:43] headache now. [screaming]
[2:41:47] IT IS FINE. THERE IS NO LAW BROKEN. TELL
[2:41:51] YOUR NEIGHBOR NO LAW BUT LAUGH.
[2:41:54] IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A FAVORITE PREACHER.
[2:41:58] BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU MUST HAVE A
[2:42:01] HOME CHURCH.
[2:42:03] A PLACE WHERE YOU SUPPORT THE CAUSE.
[2:42:08] WHAT CAUSE?
[2:42:10] THE VISION. WHICH MEANS THERE MUST BE A
[2:42:14] MAN, A PASTOR WHO HAS A VISION THAT YOU
[2:42:19] BELIEVE TO BE THE VISION OF GOD FOR YOUR
[2:42:21] LIFE.
[2:42:24] AND THEN YOU SIT UNDER THAT MINISTRY.
[2:42:26] YOU SUPPORT IT WITH YOUR OFFERINGS,
[2:42:30] WITH YOUR TITHE. SOME OF YOU DON'T EVEN
[2:42:33] pay tithe.
[2:42:36] YOU WILL NEVER PROSPER. I TELL YOU,
[2:42:38] IF YOU WANT TO PROSPER IN YOUR FINANCIAL
[2:42:40] LIFE,
[2:42:42] PAY TITHE.
[2:42:45] I'm now not speaking this as me. I'm
[2:42:46] speaking IN MY OFFICE NOW. I AM
[2:42:49] ANOINTING NOW.
[2:42:52] IF I LISTEN TO THIS AFTERWARDS, I'll
[2:42:53] feel so bad about myself.
[2:42:57] TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, PAY TITHE.
[2:43:01] EVERY BELIEVER MUST PAY TITHE.
[2:43:04] One brother told me a pastor. He said,
[2:43:07] WELL, SOME PEOPLE WILL COME AND TELL
[2:43:09] YOU, PASTOR, I HAVE SO MANY NEEDS
[2:43:13] UNTIL I CAN'T PAY MY TITHE.
[2:43:19] AND I TOLD HIM, BROTHER, CHANGE IT.
[2:43:21] SAYING THAT PHRASE AND SAY IT THIS WAY.
[2:43:24] I HAVE SO MANY NEEDS
[2:43:27] NOT TO PAY MY TITHE
[2:43:35] BECAUSE YOUR MONEY IS not 10%.
[2:43:41] That is God is. BUT IF YOU ARE EVEN WITH
[2:43:44] 90 OR EVEN 100 OF WHAT YOU THINK you
[2:43:46] have,
[2:43:49] you can never take care of your needs.
[2:43:54] BUT IF YOU HONOR GOD,
[2:43:57] AMEN. AND SUPPORT THE CAUSE,
[2:44:00] GOD HIMSELF WILL HONOR YOU AND POWER.
[2:44:08] [cheering]
[2:44:10] AMEN.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; Friend of mine, Pastor Tim.
[2:44:14] Now that brother Ed is dead,
[2:44:17] brother Tim is my mentor now.
[2:44:23] I met brother Tim in uh Germany
[2:44:28] and we sitting down talking about
[2:44:29] ministry and
[2:44:32] you know he has had a ministry of over
[2:44:33] 50 years
[2:44:36] and he told me we're talking about
[2:44:38] finances
[2:44:40] in ministry
[2:44:42] and he told me see brother I'll tell you
[2:44:45] something
[2:44:47] you know you're doing a great
[2:44:51] some other personal things. And then he
[2:44:52] told me this, "Teach your people to
[2:44:54] tithe.
[2:44:57] God will bless your work. Teach your
[2:45:00] people to tithe."
[2:45:02] And he told me this. He said, "I I've
[2:45:05] had a few brothers here and there come
[2:45:06] up in the church
[2:45:10] and I've told me of their financial wars
[2:45:16] in his church
[2:45:18] and I always bring them.
[2:45:21] They come to me for prayer.
[2:45:24] I bring them and I tell them to open
[2:45:27] Malachi
[2:45:29] chapter 3. Will a man rob God and yet
[2:45:33] you have robbed me? And you say wherein
[2:45:36] in tes and offers
[2:45:38] bring all your TES AND OFFERS
[2:45:41] AND see me here with AND SEE IF POWER A
[2:45:46] BLESSING FROM heaven
[2:45:49] that you will not have a place to KEEP
[2:45:51] ME.
[2:45:52] AND HE TOLD ME I ALWAYS TAKE BREAK COME
[2:45:55] HERE BROTHER. I ALWAYS TAKE THESE these
[2:45:57] people come just come.
[2:46:00] I always you yourself give me a hand.
[2:46:03] I always take these people
[2:46:06] and I take their finger
[2:46:08] and I point at that scripture
[2:46:13] and I tell them I DON'T NEED TO PRAY FOR
[2:46:15] YOU BROTHER.
[2:46:17] DO WHAT THE BIBLE says
[2:46:19] and the blessing is already.
[2:46:22] And he told me remember this is a
[2:46:25] ministry for more than 50 years.
[2:46:29] So he's saying something which is time
[2:46:31] tested
[2:46:35] and proven.
[2:46:37] Recently I was dealing with a brother
[2:46:40] before he's a member of this church
[2:46:44] before he was really very well
[2:46:47] and and and NOW THINGS WERE BAD
[2:46:49] EVERYWHERE.
[2:46:51] And I remember I prayed for wait
[2:46:55] you used to be what happened
[2:46:58] but do you pay your tithe
[2:47:02] I knew that's THE REASON SO FRIENDS
[2:47:06] SUPPORT THE CAUSE
[2:47:09] YOU MUST HAVE a home church where you
[2:47:11] support the cause and you must by the
[2:47:14] way you're blessed
[2:47:16] to have a pastor who is not money hungry
[2:47:20] I don't preach to you because of your
[2:47:21] money
[2:47:24] because I have a calling upon my life
[2:47:28] and I'm burdened
[2:47:30] to speak what I speak
[2:47:33] and for you to pay your tithe is not
[2:47:34] helping me.
[2:47:38] Pastor, you're rude. I'm sorry. Is the
[2:47:41] anointing making me this?
[2:47:45] You're not helping me. You're helping
[2:47:46] yourself.
[2:47:49] Because if you don't pay your tithe,
[2:47:53] you cannot prosper for
[2:48:01] 10% amens. But that's okay.
[2:48:08] Usually pastors fear to talk about this.
[2:48:11] They even fear to ask people to give
[2:48:13] money to go to a camp or meet or
[2:48:15] conference or whatever.
[2:48:19] BUT THE MORE THEY ARE FEAR [screaming]
[2:48:20] TO DO THAT,
[2:48:22] THE MORE the people suffer
[2:48:25] and THE MORE THE PASTORS BEG our
[2:48:31] we a little church here.
[2:48:34] SEE HOW MUCH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
[2:48:35] ACCOMPLISH.
[2:48:38] I'm talking about financially.
[2:48:40] We hold a youth camp. Every year for 4
[2:48:43] years now
[2:48:45] and every year it costs not less than 50
[2:48:48] million.
[2:48:52] We bu we were buying a church plot
[2:48:55] AND WE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE. WHAT AM I
[2:48:57] TALKING ABOUT? ONLY GOD CAN DO THAT.
[2:49:01] WHY? BECAUSE IF YOU CATCH THE VISION,
[2:49:07] YOU MAY PAY YOUR TITHE AS 1,000, 2,000,
[2:49:10] 5,000. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
[2:49:14] GOD PROMISED A BLESSING.
[2:49:16] BUT THE BLESSING, HE DID NOT SAY IT WILL
[2:49:18] BE MONEY.
[2:49:20] THE BLESSING OF GOD MAKES RICH.
[2:49:24] IT COMES IN MANY FORM.
[2:49:28] Praise God.
[2:49:31] If we can have
[2:49:34] 50 people
[2:49:37] in this church totally focused
[2:49:42] on the vision,
[2:49:44] then would have a church that would
[2:49:47] shake this country.
[2:49:51] Hallelujah.
[2:49:53] &gt;&gt; This region,
[2:49:56] this continent,
[2:49:58] now you may look at me as a dreamer. I
[2:49:59] am
[2:50:02] it is vision disturbing
[2:50:06] and when God gives you vision because
[2:50:09] gives you a vision which is bigger than
[2:50:10] you.
[2:50:13] If if it is smaller than you then it's
[2:50:15] not vision
[2:50:17] [snorts]
[2:50:19] but it's bigger than you
[2:50:21] something you think you can never
[2:50:25] but then God
[2:50:27] anoints you believe it is possible and
[2:50:31] then he gives you people who BELIEVE IN
[2:50:33] YOUR VISION THAT KIND OF CHURCH
[2:50:37] IT CAN accomplish a lot for the kingdom
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; You see, you can have a favorite
[2:50:45] preacher.
[2:50:48] BUT IN EVERY LOCAL CHURCH,
[2:50:51] there is a vision bearer.
[2:50:56] GOD GIVES A VISION WITHOUT THE direction
[2:50:59] of the church.
[2:51:05] This man is under divine assignment FROM
[2:51:07] THE LORD.
[2:51:11] HE GOES OUT. IT IS A RISKY THING FOR
[2:51:14] ANYONE to reject him.
[2:51:17] It is risky to ridicule him.
[2:51:20] It is risky to disrespect him.
[2:51:25] BECAUSE TO YOU, HE'S A MAN OF THE HOUR.
[2:51:31] AMEN. They risk failing to catch the
[2:51:33] vision of the hour.
[2:51:39] if you fail to understand
[2:51:42] the man of your heart.
[2:51:45] And this is a quote which Brother Glover
[2:51:46] sent me
[2:51:48] which I'm just going to read for you
[2:51:49] right now. And by the way, he asked me
[2:51:52] to greet the church.
[2:51:55] Amen. Brother Glover is a wonderful
[2:51:57] preacher.
[2:51:59] Bless
[2:51:59] &gt;&gt; us in the youth camp, but he's younger
[2:52:01] than I.
[2:52:04] uh he looks much older though
[2:52:08] trying to do God a service without being
[2:52:10] the will of God.
[2:52:15] I encourage each and every one of us to
[2:52:16] go and listen to that message.
[2:52:22] Oh man, I was so excited when the
[2:52:24] brother sent me this quote.
[2:52:26] I was so excited and God bless him. But
[2:52:29] I want to read it for you.
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; And I just took a paragraph, two
[2:52:33] paragraphs before and after, but the one
[2:52:34] he sent me is in the middle, but I'll
[2:52:35] just read it all. SAYS, "GOD REVEALS
[2:52:37] THIS word in the season."
[2:52:42] Put it up here, brother. And to whom he
[2:52:44] chooses revealing.
[2:52:48] God chooses who he reveals it to.
[2:52:54] Thank God for choosing me.
[2:52:57] Thank God for choosing him.
[2:53:00] IN THIS HOUR. HE CHOSE THAT BEFORE THE
[2:53:03] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[2:53:06] ALL OF HIS DOINGS WERE FOR KNOWN by him,
[2:53:12] hidden from man.
[2:53:15] HE JUST REVEALS THEM AS he will.
[2:53:20] IT IS HIS CHOSEN SEASON,
[2:53:24] HIS CHOSEN PERSON.
[2:53:28] TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, CHOSEN SEASON,
[2:53:30] CHOSEN [screaming] PERSON.
[2:53:36] WHO IS IT THAT WILL DARE TO CORRECT HIM?
[2:53:50] THIS MAN DOESN'T BELIEVE LIKE WE
[2:53:51] BELIEVE.
[2:53:54] WHO IS GOING TO TELL GOD HE'S WRONG IN
[2:53:56] IT?
[2:53:59] IT WOULD TAKE SOMEBODY THAT'S A LITTLE
[2:54:00] MORE OF A DELUANT THAN I AM to tell him
[2:54:02] that.
[2:54:11] HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.
[2:54:15] Tell your neighbor, GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S
[2:54:17] DOING.
[2:54:19] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[2:54:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:54:22] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHO TO CHOOSE.
[2:54:27] HE KNOWS WHO NOT TO CHOOSE.
[2:54:31] NOW, let me talk to the married people.
[2:54:34] GOD, [screaming] YOU MIGHT THINK HE MADE
[2:54:36] A CHOICE.
[2:54:38] AMEN. God chose FOR YOU.
[2:54:43] GOD KNOWS [screaming] WHAT HE'S DOING.
[2:54:46] NEVER SAY I MADE A BAD DECISION.
[2:54:50] IF YOU A CHILD OF GOD, [screaming]
[2:54:53] WHERE YOU ARE NOW, WHO YOU HAVE NOW,
[2:54:56] [screaming]
[2:54:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT WAS GOD'S CHOICE.
[2:55:00] MANY OF YOU HAVE FATHERS, MOTHERS
[2:55:01] [screaming] YOU DON'T LIKE,
[2:55:04] BUT GOD CHOSE THEM FOR YOU.
[2:55:07] YOU SEE, IT IS GOD'S [screaming] CHOICE.
[2:55:10] WHATEVER HE CHOOSES IS GOOD. YOU CAN'T
[2:55:13] QUESTION HIM.
[2:55:18] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:55:19] &gt;&gt; STOP GRUMBLING AND MURMURING.
[2:55:33] who to choose and who not to choose,
[2:55:36] where to do and when to DO IT. NO MATTER
[2:55:40] HOW MUCH [screaming] WE THINK THAT A
[2:55:41] CERTAIN PERSON IS QUALIFIED
[2:55:44] TO DO A CERTAIN JOB,
[2:55:49] GOD KNOWS WHO IS QUALIFIED
[2:55:53] FOR THE TIME AND THE SEASON OR THE TIME
[2:55:58] [screaming]
[2:55:58] AND THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IT.
[2:56:02] HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. YOU MAY BE
[2:56:05] CALLED.
[2:56:07] YOU MAY BE CHOSEN TO DO SOMETHING,
[2:56:11] BUT YOU DON'T DISCERN THE SEASON
[2:56:14] AND YOU MESS UP EVERYTHING.
[2:56:16] MOSES WAS CALLED. MOSES WAS CHOSEN TO
[2:56:20] LIBERATE THE JEWS, THE ISRAELITES,
[2:56:23] BUT HE DID NOT DISCERN THE TIME. HE
[2:56:26] DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TRAINING FOR THEM.
[2:56:28] AND HE KILLED A man
[2:56:31] right man wrong SEASON
[2:56:36] DOING GOD A SERVICE
[2:56:39] WITHOUT IT BEING HIS WILL.
[2:56:42] I remember when we MOVED TO CAMPALA.
[2:56:45] MY pastor moved me here and uh precious.
[2:56:48] I remember your dad was one of those and
[2:56:49] a few other people and we came HERE
[2:56:53] PRAYING FOR THE will of God.
[2:56:58] I wanted to stay in Mitana.
[2:57:02] But I I I felt in my spirit
[2:57:05] that was not the will of God because
[2:57:08] there were people who had believed in
[2:57:09] this area
[2:57:11] and they needed a shepherd.
[2:57:14] I was pulled to come here.
[2:57:16] I DIDN'T HAVE NO MONEY, NOTHING. NO one
[2:57:19] sponsored me or supported me.
[2:57:23] Not even a dime. We came and looked for
[2:57:25] A PLACE. WHILE I WAS DRIVING AROUND, I
[2:57:28] HAD THIS uh first car that I had and
[2:57:30] very nice car,
[2:57:33] very cool, well insulated. It was a
[2:57:35] Toyota
[2:57:37] or something.
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; So then I was driving. I DIDN'T EVEN
[2:57:41] REALIZE
[2:57:42] CUZ I JUST HAD people do it like this.
[2:57:45] BUT I JUST HAD STEPPED THROUGH A THREE
[2:57:48] phase
[2:57:53] because I REALIZED AS I WAS DANCING.
[2:57:58] I was dancing
[2:58:00] because of THE EFFECT OF THE POWER
[2:58:04] went through me. I was supposed to die
[2:58:09] right over there
[2:58:12] somewhere around those regions
[2:58:15] and uh you know AND THEN SOMETHING
[2:58:18] HAPPENED FRIENDS.
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; I JUST COME TO MYSELF
[2:58:22] WHEN I was dying and I and I and I and I
[2:58:26] AND I I STEPPED ON THE on the
[2:58:29] accelerator.
[2:58:31] IT COULDN'T GO. BUT FRIENDS, THE ANGEL
[2:58:34] of the LORD WAS THERE
[2:58:36] BEFORE I KNEW IT. MY CAR WAS OUT OF THAT
[2:58:40] ELECTRICITY zone
[2:58:43] and I stepped out. Everybody was doing
[2:58:46] this.
[2:58:48] There are many people around.
[2:58:51] Everybody knew I was supposed to die.
[2:58:55] BUT THE DEVIL KNEW THAT YOU WOULD BE
[2:58:57] HERE TODAY.
[2:59:00] WHENEVER GOD CALLS A MAN
[2:59:03] INTO A PLACE, INTO A TIME, INTO A
[2:59:06] SEASON, THERE ARE MANY ADVERSARIES.
[2:59:09] BUT ALWAYS GOD IS AVAILABLE TO FIGHT.
[2:59:14] [screaming]
[2:59:15] WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
[2:59:18] AT that time, I didn't even have an idea
[2:59:19] to start a church.
[2:59:22] Long story short, WE START A HOME HERE.
[2:59:26] my family moves and I will find out.
[2:59:29] I do not have at a time an idea. So,
[2:59:32] Lord, should I join other churches?
[2:59:36] Because I saw myself more of a
[2:59:37] missionary than I am a pastor.
[2:59:41] But I said maybe just one one church AND
[2:59:43] THEN WHEN WE TRIED TO DO IT, THE LORD
[2:59:47] SPOKE TO ME AND MY WIFE, NO.
[2:59:54] I said, "Now what Lord
[2:59:56] So I decided to speak to a few pastors,
[2:59:58] hear the opinions. But let me tell you
[3:00:01] brother, some people when you are
[3:00:03] confused,
[3:00:05] they will give you their opinions.
[3:00:08] Some of them WILL BE FROM GOD, OTHERS
[3:00:11] WILL BE FROM THEM, OTHERS WILL BE FROM
[3:00:14] the devil.
[3:00:16] Be sure you have heard from God.
[3:00:22] So then, LONG STORY SHORT, THE LORD
[3:00:25] DEALT WITH US ON ONE TIME, ONE EVENING,
[3:00:29] IMPRESS IT UPON me to start a fellowship
[3:00:31] right away. And we started in the home
[3:00:33] with only my family.
[3:00:37] Now friends, why am I saying that?
[3:00:40] You see, that was the season.
[3:00:44] God had it in mind. It was the season
[3:00:48] for that ministry to start.
[3:00:50] When I say ministry, God has given me a
[3:00:52] gift. Our ministry is not mine.
[3:00:57] Is for the people of that season he has
[3:01:00] intended for you.
[3:01:02] Some of you preachers who are here.
[3:01:05] Some of you are preachers and you're
[3:01:06] ALREADY PREACHING.
[3:01:09] OTHERS you are preachers and you have
[3:01:11] not yet start launched out.
[3:01:14] Others you don't even know yet.
[3:01:17] But yet YOU ARE PREACHERS. WORLD HAS a
[3:01:20] sense of humor
[3:01:23] AND HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WHEN
[3:01:26] AND SOMETIMES WHAT IS WHAT HE DOES IS
[3:01:28] LAUGHABLE.
[3:01:30] SO WHEN WE WERE STARTING I KNOW MANY MEN
[3:01:34] LAUGHED AT US. THEY THOUGHT WE WERE
[3:01:36] JOKING. When with 15 PEOPLE IN THE
[3:01:38] CHURCH WE ANNOUNCED WE ARE STARTING LAND
[3:01:41] FUND.
[3:01:43] HOW MUCH MONEY? 150 MILLIONS we are
[3:01:46] looking for.
[3:01:51] SOME OF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.
[3:01:55] thieves and robbers and
[3:01:58] conmen and you remember that some of
[3:02:00] you.
[3:02:02] But let me tell you, if a vision is OF
[3:02:04] THE HOLY SPIRIT and a season is right,
[3:02:08] the devil can't stop it. Hallelujah.
[3:02:11] Amen. AND WHEN YOU ARE BURDENED WITH A
[3:02:14] VISION,
[3:02:15] IT'S THE RIGHT SEASON AND YOU'RE THE
[3:02:18] RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB, EVEN YOU CAN'T
[3:02:21] STOP IT.
[3:02:24] And so friends,
[3:02:26] we we notice here that even David
[3:02:29] himself WHEN HE SET IT OUT, GOD SENDS A
[3:02:33] MAN, anoint him,
[3:02:36] he anointed him to be what?
[3:02:40] Did he become a king immediately?
[3:02:43] No. No.
[3:02:47] And for all that time, David knew
[3:02:52] he was a king.
[3:02:54] But it didn't cause trouble in the
[3:02:55] kingdom.
[3:03:01] I know God spoke to me. I'm the next
[3:03:03] person.
[3:03:08] M so because of that inspiration you
[3:03:11] have
[3:03:12] you begin moving maneuvering
[3:03:20] that's not here but in other churches
[3:03:21] I've seen it
[3:03:26] and when you sit down this person
[3:03:28] and you ask them brother what is happen
[3:03:31] you know God spoke to me
[3:03:34] that I'm the pastor of this
[3:03:38] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; So if he spoke to you, it means you
[3:03:42] should maneuver politically.
[3:03:46] So you are a helper of God.
[3:03:49] God doesn't need helpers.
[3:03:52] God helps himself.
[3:03:56] IF IT IS HIS SEASON AND HIS TIME FOR
[3:04:00] YOU, HE WILL OPEN THE DOOR. HALLELUJAH.
[3:04:06] Something brother of many things brother
[3:04:07] Ed Biscard taught me
[3:04:11] one stands out never forget it. He said
[3:04:14] this
[3:04:16] don't push a door open
[3:04:21] wait for God to open THE DOOR.
[3:04:25] WHEN HE OPENS THE DOOR, MATTER OF FACT,
[3:04:28] DON'T WALK THROUGH IT. RUN THROUGH HERE.
[3:04:30] [screaming]
[3:04:36] SO YOU SEE, YOU DON'T PUSH THINGS. YOU
[3:04:38] DON'T MOVE THINGS.
[3:04:41] You feel calling on my life to preach.
[3:04:44] I feel the anointed fire.
[3:04:48] But you see, brother, the problem is our
[3:04:51] pastor.
[3:04:53] He doesn't GIVE ME A CHANCE.
[3:04:56] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[3:04:56] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WOULD IF YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME
[3:04:58] A CHANCE,
[3:05:00] you would have seen the fire falling.
[3:05:03] The problem. SO YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE
[3:05:06] PASTOR, THE MINISTERS, OUR OTHER PEOPLE
[3:05:08] AS A PROBLEM. [screaming]
[3:05:12] OH, MAY GOD GIVE US MORE DAVIDS.
[3:05:15] DAVID WAS HUMBLE.
[3:05:18] HE WAS A MAN OF [screaming] CHARACTER.
[3:05:20] HE KNEW HE WAS ANOINTED. HE KNEW HE WAS
[3:05:23] THE NEXT KING.
[3:05:24] BUT YET [screaming]
[3:05:26] HE STILL SERVED THE KING.
[3:05:30] AMEN.
[3:05:31] &gt;&gt; Let me finish now.
[3:05:32] &gt;&gt; Not finish the sermon but finish the
[3:05:35] service.
[3:05:38] &gt;&gt; Probably we'll have another par.
[3:05:40] AND THE REAL TRUE CHRISTIAN,
[3:05:43] the real true believer in God, brother
[3:05:47] waits upon the Lord for these things.
[3:05:54] Wait on your ministry.
[3:06:00] Me, I have a gift of singing.
[3:06:03] Can you imagine? They call that little
[3:06:05] girl to see
[3:06:08] and they can't they don't even know what
[3:06:10] is in me
[3:06:12] and makes it matter worse someone can
[3:06:14] come
[3:06:16] I'll tell you I I'll tell you a story
[3:06:19] I've spoken so many stories haven't
[3:06:22] usually old people do that
[3:06:25] but I'm a young man I don't know why I'm
[3:06:26] telling a story
[3:06:29] one time brother Andrew
[3:06:33] one of the elders in the church where I
[3:06:35] was
[3:06:37] in Mitana
[3:06:39] years before we went to Ethiopia
[3:06:43] came to me and said
[3:06:46] uh brother
[3:06:48] the way the way me I see you and and me
[3:06:51] I'm representing many others
[3:06:55] that's how they speak
[3:06:57] I'm representing many others
[3:07:00] the way I see you
[3:07:02] are not just supposed to be a minister
[3:07:03] in the
[3:07:06] You are supposed to be a pastor.
[3:07:09] What seed was you sowing in me?
[3:07:14] And then after he said that, he began to
[3:07:16] talk about many things bad about my
[3:07:18] life.
[3:07:20] God had anointed me
[3:07:23] to stand with that man of God.
[3:07:29] And I thank God
[3:07:31] and I know he watches our services. my
[3:07:33] pastor.
[3:07:36] And I would say this, I thank God.
[3:07:39] I thank God. Not for one time
[3:07:43] have I ever fought his ministry.
[3:07:47] Yet, many times I had what you would
[3:07:50] call opportunities
[3:07:54] to fight it.
[3:07:57] But it's time I stood behind him. Why?
[3:08:01] That was the grace of God he had placed
[3:08:05] upon my life
[3:08:08] to give me that character.
[3:08:11] But character comes from God
[3:08:15] and the things which you go through in
[3:08:16] life.
[3:08:18] So whatever you are going through now
[3:08:21] is molding character.
[3:08:27] One time this brother he was so daring
[3:08:32] And I I I was so done with it.
[3:08:37] I read a quote for him,
[3:08:39] brother saying, "Stay with your person."
[3:08:42] And one time, God, the devil could
[3:08:45] anoint somebody. I read it for you last
[3:08:46] time.
[3:08:48] and he will shoot him with some poison
[3:08:51] stuff
[3:08:53] and he he he will be he will begin to
[3:08:55] move around the church
[3:09:01] maneuvering
[3:09:04] BUT STAY CLOSE TOGETHER AND STAY WITH
[3:09:06] YOUR PASTOR
[3:09:08] AND HE WILL lead you through because of
[3:09:11] God.
[3:09:12] I told his brother, "Brother, I think
[3:09:14] you are short with this poison.
[3:09:19] You are short with some poison stuff.
[3:09:25] You're poisoning my heart. I don't want
[3:09:28] to EVER HEAR THESE THINGS AGAIN.
[3:09:31] BUT IF I had not overcome that
[3:09:33] temptation,
[3:09:36] let me tell you to someone who is gifted
[3:09:38] and called of God,
[3:09:41] that's a big temptation.
[3:09:47] Brother Brian, when you are gifted
[3:09:50] and you you know you can sing
[3:09:54] maybe even better than brother Shalom,
[3:09:57] but you just see it.
[3:10:01] You think it is easy.
[3:10:03] You think I don't know. You think God
[3:10:05] doesn't know.
[3:10:08] You understand church what I'm trying to
[3:10:09] say. When you are called, you know you
[3:10:12] are called. You know your gift. But
[3:10:14] you're not given opportunity.
[3:10:16] The devil can use that. So well
[3:10:21] politically maneuvering
[3:10:24] in your heart
[3:10:26] weaken you and overthrow you.
[3:10:29] But as I finish Bam says this, wait on
[3:10:33] your ministry.
[3:10:36] If you feel a call,
[3:10:40] be sure that it's God.
[3:10:44] Be sure that it's right.
[3:10:47] Be sure that it's timely.
[3:10:52] What you are saying is timely.
[3:10:56] Your ministry is timely.
[3:10:59] Be sure and brother says one way you can
[3:11:01] be sure is to check your motives and
[3:11:02] objectives.
[3:11:08] Oh, I want to be seen. Oh, I want some
[3:11:10] money. I want
[3:11:13] motive.
[3:11:15] be led of the Holy Spirit.
[3:11:18] Don't let anything obscure that vision.
[3:11:25] Our vision is Christ.
[3:11:30] Friends, it's 120. I need to quit now.
[3:11:36] But the way I feel and the way I feel
[3:11:37] that you feel, I can preach for more
[3:11:39] than 30 minutes right now.
[3:11:42] But I just quit right now.
[3:11:46] Brother Wanga I know cannot preach for
[3:11:48] cannot interpret for more than 30
[3:11:50] minutes right now. So I'll excuse him.
[3:11:53] Let us stand on our feet.
[3:12:02] God is God.
[3:12:06] We need him to change our heart.
[3:12:10] We need to be more humble,
[3:12:14] &gt;&gt; you know,
[3:12:16] as the musicians play.
[3:12:19] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about it
[3:12:24] and maybe if I can have more sound,
[3:12:25] brother, a little more.
[3:12:33] You know, many times we feel we have
[3:12:34] abilities to do things.
[3:12:40] You know you can do something
[3:12:42] but it's not about can do.
[3:12:46] It's about the vision of God,
[3:12:48] the person he has chosen and the right
[3:12:51] timing.
[3:12:54] But each of us is a servant.
[3:12:57] Each of us is called to serve.
[3:13:00] You're not just called to be a good
[3:13:02] church member.
[3:13:04] You're called to serve.
[3:13:07] Ask the Lord, Lord,
[3:13:10] what addition am I going to be to the
[3:13:12] body?
[3:13:16] Yes, I know I'm supporting with my
[3:13:18] attendance, [music]
[3:13:19] tithes and offerings,
[3:13:24] but what else can I do?
[3:13:26] What talent have you placed in me?
[3:13:30] We need more people who are burdened
[3:13:32] like that in the ministry.
[3:13:36] But because we we have a lot of people
[3:13:39] that are not burdened, ministry becomes
[3:13:41] heavy for it.
[3:13:47] You find men and women doing things just
[3:13:49] for the sake of
[3:13:53] that. But if you're going to be a
[3:13:54] singer, be the best.
[3:13:56] Be the best.
[3:13:58] If you're going to play instruments,
[3:14:00] minutes,
[3:14:01] give it time. Give it concentration.
[3:14:06] If you're working in the media
[3:14:07] department,
[3:14:09] don't allow the devil to maneuver in
[3:14:11] your mind
[3:14:14] and makes you make make you think that
[3:14:16] look others can do it. Well, why are you
[3:14:18] called to do it?
[3:14:22] You are the one God has called.
[3:14:25] There is a reason why God does not call
[3:14:27] many at a time. He calls one at a time.
[3:14:32] It's your season now. Tomorrow it is
[3:14:35] someone ELSE'S SEASON.
[3:14:37] BUT WHILE IT IS your season,
[3:14:40] FIND OUT, LORD, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME
[3:14:42] TO DO?
[3:14:45] If it's the right season for you to do
[3:14:47] something for me
[3:14:49] and you fit right into it, then watch
[3:14:52] the blessing of God
[3:14:54] coming upon your life.
[3:14:57] Change my heart, oh God. Let us sing
[3:14:59] that.
[3:15:03] Change my heart, oh God. Brother Shalom,
[3:15:07] come and help me. I don't have any more
[3:15:08] sound voice to say.
[3:15:12] Make it ever true.
[3:15:17] Oh s just worship with me this morning.
[3:15:22] &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh God. [music]
[3:15:25] [singing]
[3:15:30] May I be [singing and music] like you.
[3:15:35] Sing it again. Change my heart.
[3:15:38] Change my [singing] heart, oh God.
[3:15:42] [music]
[3:15:46] Oh yes.
