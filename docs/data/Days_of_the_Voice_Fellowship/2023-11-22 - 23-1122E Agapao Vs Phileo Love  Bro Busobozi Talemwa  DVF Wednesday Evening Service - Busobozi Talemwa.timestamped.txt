[33:01] we are beginning to read from verse one
[33:02] and we shall read up to verse
[33:08] 8
[33:14] amen though I speak with the tongues of
[33:17] men and of angels and have not charity I
[33:19] am become as sounding brass or a
[33:22] tinkling symbol and though I have the
[33:25] gift of Prophecy
[33:27] and understand all Mysteries and all
[33:31] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[33:35] that I could remove mountains and have
[33:37] not
[33:38] charity I am
[33:40] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[33:43] to feed the poor and though I give my
[33:45] body to be burned and have not charity
[33:49] it profiteth me
[33:52] nothing charity and wherever they've
[33:55] written charity please replace it with
[33:57] love it's the same
[34:02] thing so then I will use the word
[34:05] love love suffereth long and is kind
[34:09] love envieth not love vth not itself it
[34:13] is is not P up do not behave itself
[34:17] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[34:20] easily provoked thinketh no evil
[34:24] rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in
[34:27] the truth beareth all things believeth
[34:30] all things hopeth all things endureth
[34:33] all things Love Never Fails but where
[34:37] where whether there be prophecies they
[34:39] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[34:42] shall seize whether there be knowledge
[34:45] it shall vanish away love never fails
[34:49] praise God come amen you may be
[34:52] seated may the Lord bless the reading of
[34:54] the word and may he speak to us this
[34:56] evening
[34:58] so I just want to speak to you on and
[35:01] being that we also ministering on Zoom
[35:03] it is always go can only go for one
[35:07] hour so I just want you attention so we
[35:11] can just go right quick
[35:14] through amen and uh I just want to speak
[35:17] on AAP versus F
[35:25] love
[35:30] so all right so we will maybe get to
[35:32] explain that a little later but AAP AAP
[35:36] is divine
[35:41] love yeah love or or the love of
[35:47] God yeah and F love is uh the human
[35:53] love amen do you if you are close to
[35:57] somebody ask them do you love
[36:02] me do you love me brother of course I
[36:04] love you my
[36:06] pastor praise God Amen so now each of
[36:10] you what were you
[36:13] told probably somebody say that they do
[36:16] it they love you but tonight I want us
[36:21] to find out whether that person truly
[36:22] loves
[36:25] you what is
[36:27] love you see we have a wrong conception
[36:30] many times a wrong conception of
[36:33] love and I know that we are in a
[36:35] generation whereby this word is used so
[36:38] many
[36:41] times until it has come to a place where
[36:43] even it has devalued or lost its real
[36:49] meaning whereby we are not able to know
[36:52] or to understand whether truly somebody
[36:54] loves you or not
[36:59] some somebody will find a girl out there
[37:02] that maybe she's a chorus girl or a
[37:05] street girl and then they would say to
[37:06] them that I love
[37:11] you and and I don't know whether there's
[37:13] somebody here who has ever suffered or
[37:15] who has been victim of what I'm going to
[37:17] say
[37:19] now you go on your phone you never met
[37:23] the person you do not know them
[37:27] and because you've been exchanging back
[37:29] and forth
[37:31] texts and uh you you just develop
[37:34] feelings for
[37:36] them and then you kind of feel that you
[37:38] really love
[37:39] them and then you begin speaking as if
[37:43] it were that you were
[37:47] cting and there many times we've seen
[37:50] and
[37:51] heard that many girls have been
[37:55] heartbroken the by boys that spoke to
[37:58] them for a long time and then eventually
[38:00] said I'm sorry I'm not going to marry
[38:05] you oh then of course maybe sometimes
[38:08] even they would not tell them that I'm
[38:10] going to marry someone else they'll just
[38:12] hear when the person is already
[38:18] married and many would even tell you
[38:20] that I love you and then marry you and
[38:22] then leave
[38:25] you
[38:28] and then they have words they use like I
[38:30] will love you until let Victoria
[38:35] dries I will love you until East Meets
[38:42] West I will love you until it is no
[38:44] longer
[38:47] raining I will love you with my whole
[38:50] heart and words that are so so
[38:54] powerful they will try to Define love by
[38:56] their
[38:58] words but even those that try to use
[39:01] those words many times still it
[39:06] failed and and sometimes we think it's
[39:09] only among the young
[39:12] people but I want to tell you no it's
[39:15] not even among the older ones you find
[39:19] marriages failing at uh 50 60
[39:24] years someone 50 years old filing for
[39:27] divorce 70
[39:31] 60 but but then yet if you go back 50 or
[39:35] 40 years
[39:38] ago and you asked them one of them or
[39:41] both of them whether or they loved each
[39:45] other they will tell you that truly we
[39:47] love one
[39:49] another we shall grow all
[39:51] together and nothing will be able to
[39:53] separate
[39:54] us and nothing can come between
[39:57] us and then again you find that it
[40:01] fails maybe after 10 or 20
[40:03] years after 30 years 40 years sometimes
[40:08] 50 50th year you find others
[40:12] divorcing and so then you wonder was it
[40:15] love to begin
[40:17] with because according to what we have
[40:19] read in the Bible in the book of First
[40:22] Corinthians the Bible says that love in
[40:25] verse 8 chapter
[40:27] 13:8 Love Never
[40:32] Fails tell your neighbor Love Never
[40:35] Fails if you love that love cannot
[40:41] fail so if truly those people loved each
[40:45] other they cannot
[40:47] divorce because that love that binds
[40:50] them is so strong that it cannot
[40:55] fail find that it is not really
[41:00] love what we really call many times love
[41:02] is not really
[41:05] love but it is human
[41:10] love and human love is not really
[41:14] love True Love Never
[41:17] Fails true love is not
[41:20] selfish true love will be
[41:22] patient true love will not
[41:25] envy it will not be
[41:28] P it will think no
[41:31] evil it will not bust itself it will
[41:34] bear all things and believe all
[41:37] things true love will endure all
[41:40] things everything else can fail a
[41:44] prophecy can
[41:45] fail tongues can fail knowledge can fail
[41:50] and everything can vanish away but there
[41:53] is one thing that cannot fail and that
[41:55] is love
[41:56] [Music]
[41:59] and so I'm going to talk to you tonight
[42:00] about
[42:01] [Music]
[42:02] love but then of course speak about the
[42:05] two types of
[42:07] love are you following me
[42:10] tonight the message do you now
[42:14] believe he says now there is two
[42:16] different kinds of
[42:19] Love there is human
[42:21] love which is in Greek which in a Greek
[42:24] word is f
[42:29] love and then
[42:32] love which is high love or Divine
[42:38] love everybody
[42:43] say so those are the two kinds of
[42:46] love now you take like the pH
[42:50] love when we have that love a mother for
[42:53] her baby will drive her right straight
[42:56] to a flaming fire to save that baby's
[43:03] life it will make a man for his sweet
[43:06] heart laid down his life any
[43:11] time what I mean is that is just human
[43:17] love but yet that love is also powerful
[43:22] in a
[43:24] way that kind of love can actually make
[43:27] a
[43:29] woman it can make a
[43:32] mother desire to go uh Through Fire to
[43:37] be able to save her
[43:41] child you know brother Solomon if you
[43:43] have that kind of
[43:46] love and you you have a woman you want
[43:49] to marry or a woman that you
[43:51] Mar you will have you have
[43:54] feelings that make you want to do
[43:59] anything any time for
[44:02] her to the
[44:04] extent that you can actually give your
[44:06] own
[44:08] life because these are to you more than
[44:13] feelings it's like a definition of what
[44:16] you have in your
[44:19] heart it is so powerful that you are
[44:21] willing to lay down your
[44:24] life and yet is just a human
[44:28] feeling and that too can
[44:33] fail that two can
[44:36] fail that two is not
[44:39] permanent that has failed many times
[44:43] over we can never rely on
[44:46] that and the problem is many Christians
[44:49] have relied on
[44:53] this human love
[44:57] andam says that I believe in somewhere
[44:59] in the Bible it
[45:02] say and we read it shortly could a
[45:05] mother forget her little suckling
[45:10] baby but maybe make but I can never
[45:14] forget you for for you are engraved in
[45:17] the palms of my
[45:20] [Music]
[45:22] hand let us read it out of Isaiah 49
[45:29] verse
[45:31] 14 but Zion said the Lord has forsaken
[45:35] me and my Lord has forgotten me can a
[45:38] woman forget her sucking child that she
[45:42] should not have compassion on the son of
[45:45] her womb yeah they may forget yet will I
[45:49] not forget
[45:54] the
[46:07] behold I have Graven thee upon the palms
[46:09] of my
[46:11] hands thy words are continually before
[46:15] me allow me to tell you something
[46:18] tonight that here is God speaking to his
[46:22] children and he's saying the Lord Zion
[46:25] is saying the Lord has forsaken
[46:28] me you know wherever he's saying Zion
[46:31] put your name
[46:33] there
[46:36] amen
[46:38] hallelujah is
[46:40] saying just put your name there put your
[46:44] name there Andrew is saying someone is
[46:48] saying who is saying
[46:50] tonight maybe you are saying my
[46:54] sister praise God
[46:57] somebody is saying Solomon is saying is
[47:02] saying John is
[47:04] saying you are saying that the Lord has
[47:08] forsaken me my Lord has forgotten me how
[47:12] many times have you felt that
[47:14] way that your prayers are not being
[47:18] answered that God has forgotten you that
[47:22] God has not heard your
[47:23] prayer that God is not hearing your cry
[47:26] many times we feel that
[47:28] way but he he asks a
[47:31] question can a woman forget her sucking
[47:36] child can a woman really do
[47:40] that just told
[47:42] us that a woman with a
[47:46] baby in
[47:48] fire she will do everything even if it
[47:51] means to
[47:54] go she will go in that
[47:57] fire to die while saving her child in
[48:02] some of the things and the news that
[48:03] came up out of out of
[48:07] Israel it is said that when the when the
[48:10] Hamas
[48:12] came you know they bur down some
[48:17] Israelis
[48:19] and to the to the point that they could
[48:22] not
[48:24] recognize who is who but then they found
[48:28] something like a a mother who was
[48:31] hugging her
[48:34] child so the mother was trying to
[48:37] protect the child so that the child will
[48:38] not
[48:40] burn but then both of them burned and
[48:44] Di but then here he asks a question can
[48:47] a mother forget her scking
[48:51] child that she should not have
[48:53] compassion on the son of her Wom
[48:57] everywhere has
[48:58] failed you know we have a proverb here
[49:01] that
[49:04] says gives birth to something bad will
[49:06] always be pity to eat whether your child
[49:08] is bad or whether your child is good or
[49:10] done good things or done bad
[49:14] things the father may even dis own the
[49:17] child but a mother a mother's
[49:21] compassion will go so far always defend
[49:26] that
[49:26] child be there for that child regardless
[49:30] of the age of that
[49:31] child because the mother's
[49:35] compassion is usually very
[49:38] strong towards the child and now God
[49:42] asks a
[49:43] question can a mother with a sucking
[49:46] child forget that
[49:49] child you might say no but here is what
[49:53] God is saying even with all the
[49:56] compassion she has for her
[50:00] child she can
[50:02] forget she can
[50:05] forget and we have many mothers like
[50:07] that who
[50:09] forget maybe you are one of those have
[50:11] been
[50:13] forgotten by your natural
[50:15] parents maybe abandoned by your natural
[50:18] parents May abandoned by your father
[50:21] maybe abandoned by your mother and you
[50:24] feel lonely and you feel
[50:27] alone you've not got that
[50:30] compassion you don't know what it means
[50:32] to have a mother's
[50:35] love you don't know what it means to
[50:37] have a Father's
[50:38] Love and yet it is something
[50:41] wonderful God is saying here through the
[50:45] word even with that compassion of a
[50:50] parental they can
[50:53] forget yes they can forget are you
[50:56] hearing me tonight yeah they can
[50:58] forget but he says but I will not forget
[51:03] you amen I rejoice in that amen tell
[51:08] somebody I rejoice in
[51:10] that I rejoice in that I rejoice in that
[51:15] he says I will not forget you this is

[51:54] hand Hallelujah am thy words are
[51:58] continually before

[52:04] sees you because you are in the palm of
[52:07] his you are in his hands he cannot
[52:11] forget Others May forsake you God cannot

[52:31] God a woman will forget her second
[52:34] child a husband will forget his wife a
[52:38] wife will forget her husband a child
[52:41] forget his parents parents will forget
[52:44] the
[52:45] child God cannot
[52:48] forget if God ever loved you
[52:51] once he will love you
[52:54] always if God chose you
[52:56] once he will choose you
[52:59] always if you are an elect of God no
[53:03] matter what sin you have done in your
[53:05] life it cannot separate you from

[53:52] will forget a sister will forget husband
[53:55] will

[54:04] somebody that you thought loved
[54:07] you don't be
[54:10] surprised don't feel
[54:12] unloved amen that love is bound to
[54:20] Faith there is only one kind of love
[54:22] that never
[54:24] fails that is agap
[54:27] love every other love will
[54:30] fil it will all break into
[54:37] pieces always
[54:40] remains in the book of Jeremiah 17:
[54:43] 5 the scripture says thus sayth the
[54:47] Lord C be the man that trusts in
[54:53] man mhm
[54:55] and maketh flesh his
[54:58] arm and whose heart depart from the
[55:02] Lord for he shall be like the heath in
[55:05] the
[55:07] desert and shall not see when good
[55:11] cometh but shall inhabit the patched
[55:14] places in the
[55:16] wilderness in a so land and not
[55:20] inhabited hallelujah hallelujah
[55:23] hallelujah Church the Bible is saying to
[55:26] us something here very
[55:28] powerful that a man or a human being
[55:32] that trust in another human
[55:35] being is not
[55:37] blessed that is cast if you make flesh
[55:41] your
[55:42] arm know we have a saying that I need
[55:45] arm to lean
[55:48] on need a heart to confide
[55:52] in let me tell you among a human
[55:56] being there is no arm you can lean
[56:00] on there is no heart you can
[56:04] conf even if your wife or husband mother
[56:08] or daughter whatever it doesn't
[56:12] matter the B did not say be a man in a
[56:17] man except when they are
[56:20] married no he said it doesn't matter who
[56:23] you
[56:23] are what relationship you
[56:27] have says cast be the man that trust in
[56:30] a
[56:33] man you cannot trust in a man you cannot
[56:37] put your trust and confidence in a human
[56:41] being no wonder brother bham told
[56:43] us no
[56:46] circumstance
[56:48] unbeliever there is a reason
[56:51] why it's about
[56:53] love love between a Believer and
[56:56] unbeliever is
[57:00] nonexistent it is does not exist let us
[57:04] bring it to another level even in the
[57:07] church if you want to marry somebody or
[57:11] get married to
[57:12] somebody both of you don't have the Holy
[57:15] Spirit there is no love between
[57:18] you there is no pure love between
[57:22] you what you have is is human
[57:27] love love it is powerful in its own
[57:31] [Music]
[57:32] ranks but it is not that
[57:35] holding it's not that powerful it will
[57:38] fail
[57:40] sometime that's why a Believer is a
[57:43] woman or man who is filled with the
[57:44] power of the Holy
[57:47] Ghost and if you're filled with the Holy
[57:49] Ghost and somebody else is filled with
[57:51] the Holy Ghost you will love one another
[57:53] forever
[57:56] why because it's not about you it's not
[57:59] about your feelings it's not about what
[58:01] you
[58:02] feel what you think it's about that
[58:06] which is in
[58:07] you it's about he that is in
[58:10] [Music]
[58:14] you can never
[58:17] fa God is
[58:21] love but a man that trusts in a man is
[58:25] cast where he
[58:27] lives praise God praise
[58:31] God his heart has already departed from
[58:34] the
[58:35] Lord praise God he will be in a
[58:40] Wilderness in PCH
[58:43] places my
[58:45] God and that's how many human beings
[58:48] live but the scripture goes ahead to
[58:51] tell us but blessed is the man
[58:55] that trust in the
[58:57] Lord and whose hope is in the
[59:00] Lord my hope is in the Lord my hope is
[59:04] in the LA my hope is not in science my
[59:07] hope is not in my job my hope is not in
[59:10] the people my hope is not in my pastor
[59:14] my hope is not in my
[59:15] friend my wife my husband my hope is in
[59:20] the
[59:21] Lord Brother sister put your hope in the
[59:25] Lord put your confidence in the
[59:28] Lord he can never disappoint you he can
[59:32] never
[59:32] fail he is only
[59:35] faithful he alone is
[59:38] faithful he cannot
[59:41] fail we trust in the Lord put your
[59:44] confidence in the
[59:46] Lord trust in the Lord
[59:48] always no matter what you you you you
[59:52] put in in
[59:53] man
[59:55] it is just waiting for
[59:58] judgment because it shall
[1:00:01] fail how many words even today even
[1:00:04] right now as I'm
[1:00:05] speaking how many people have are
[1:00:08] speaking these
[1:00:10] words but I trusted
[1:00:15] you but I trusted you how could you do
[1:00:19] this how could you
[1:00:22] disappoint friends trusted the wrong
[1:00:26] person never trust a man trust God in
[1:00:29] the
[1:00:31] man trust God in the
[1:00:34] man if you want to get married don't
[1:00:38] trust the woman don't trust the man
[1:00:41] trust God in that
[1:00:43] man TR God in the woman that is the
[1:00:47] thing of God that will never
[1:00:50] for that
[1:00:53] is wo hallelujah how many times have
[1:00:57] they
[1:00:59] said feel I love

[1:01:07] body I can't even understand anymore I'm
[1:01:11] just feeling crazy I'm feeling like
[1:01:13] crazy because I
[1:01:17] love yeah it is true but it is not
[1:01:22] genuine don't trust that
[1:01:26] and if you trust it the Bible says you
[1:01:29] are
[1:01:31] C because the Cur will
[1:01:35] follow in John
[1:01:38] 13 let me show you example of what I'm
[1:01:40] talking
[1:01:45] about4 here comes
[1:01:47] Peter script says and a new new
[1:01:50] commandment I give unto
[1:01:52] you love one another as I have loved you
[1:01:54] that you also love one another this is
[1:01:56] Jesus
[1:02:01] speaking praise God Jesus did not listen
[1:02:05] listen Jesus did not tell
[1:02:07] them love one
[1:02:10] another as you
[1:02:12] feel according to your feeling it says
[1:02:15] don't love one another according to your
[1:02:19] feeling love one
[1:02:22] another as I have loved
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:27] you what love did he have he was
[1:02:32] a he was
[1:02:35] divine he was God and he was telling us
[1:02:39] to love one another
[1:02:44] with by this by
[1:02:49] love shall all men know that ye are my
[1:02:53] disciples
[1:02:55] if he
[1:02:56] have love one to
[1:03:01] another Simon Peter said unto him
[1:03:05] Lord thou
[1:03:07] goest or go thou Jesus answered demon
[1:03:12] whether I
[1:03:14] go thou cannot follow
[1:03:17] me
[1:03:20] now why can't you follow
[1:03:23] me because the road I'm
[1:03:26] going is only for those with
[1:03:30] AAP if you don't
[1:03:33] have you cannot stand the
[1:03:36] test you cannot stand the
[1:03:39] tribulation of the journey I am
[1:03:42] taking you cannot stand this right now
[1:03:47] but later you
[1:03:49] will right now Peter you have
[1:03:53] no
[1:03:54] you will be
[1:03:56] offended you will walk
[1:03:58] away you cannot go through with
[1:04:02] this but thou shall follow me
[1:04:08] afterwards let me tell you if you do not
[1:04:11] have pure
[1:04:13] love if you don't have real
[1:04:16] love genuine love perfect
[1:04:21] love you cannot follow Jesus
[1:04:29] somewhere and it
[1:04:33] fails and many
[1:04:36] Believers are believers with ph
[1:04:39] love they don't
[1:04:42] have they believe the
[1:04:45] word in its log
[1:04:50] form but they don't go an extra
[1:04:53] mile to get agap power in their
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:04:57] hearts so then they can't follow Jesus
[1:05:01] Christ when tribulations come when
[1:05:05] problems come they fall
[1:05:08] away they walk away they just can't
[1:05:11] follow
[1:05:12] Christ it becomes difficult for
[1:05:15] them but even at that
[1:05:18] time Peter said unto him Lord why can I
[1:05:23] not follow you now
[1:05:26] do you know what is in me my
[1:05:28] heart do you know how I feel
[1:05:32] about how can you say I can't follow
[1:05:36] you this is
[1:05:38] Peter telling
[1:05:40] Jesus that your judgment is
[1:05:44] wrong you don't know what I feel for

[1:17:34] Jesus my
[1:17:36] sheep are you following
[1:17:39] me at first
[1:17:42] with thought it was all about him and
[1:17:46] Jesus it is just a selfish kind of thing
[1:17:50] but later
[1:17:52] on when did he
[1:17:54] receive when the of Pentecost was
[1:17:58] fully they were all together in one
[1:18:02] place and then there came tongues like a
[1:18:06] fire Hallelujah and divided
[1:18:10] itself among the disciples each of them
[1:18:13] received a leak of fire a leak of fire a
[1:18:16] leak of fire a Le of fire a Le of fire
[1:18:20] and they began speaking in
[1:18:23] they began speaking in Tong dancing
[1:18:26] around like and czy like drunk and
[1:18:32] propes and when people came and say
[1:18:36] you are
[1:18:38] drunk these early hours of the
[1:18:41] morning sister Juliet
[1:18:44] jul that's what they
[1:18:46] thought but do you know who these people
[1:18:49] were they were the Sheep Jesus was
[1:18:51] talking about
[1:18:54] if you receive the Revelation now say
[1:18:57] Amen those were the
[1:18:59] Sheep you drunk this early hours of the
[1:19:03] morning and Jesus said brother Peter
[1:19:06] said Peter was s just like the rest of
[1:19:09] them speaking in Tong and
[1:19:11] prophesying but then he came out it now
[1:19:14] made
[1:19:16] sense feed my
[1:19:18] sheep feed my
[1:19:20] sheep oh get now it's not about
[1:19:30] me man of
[1:19:32] Juda hear me hear
[1:19:35] me these are not drunk with wine as you
[1:19:41] suppos with the power of the Holy
[1:19:44] Ghost this is that that was spoken by
[1:19:47] the prophet
[1:19:48] John oh
[1:19:51] hallelujah oh h hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:54] and Peter
[1:19:55] spoke according to the power of the Holy
[1:19:57] Ghost by demonstration of the power of
[1:20:00] the Holy
[1:20:01] Ghost and the Bible says at the end of
[1:20:04] his
[1:20:05] speaking they began
[1:20:08] bleeding as
[1:20:10] Sheep amen am men and Brethren what
[1:20:15] shall we do and Peter said hallelujah
[1:20:19] praise God every one of you
[1:20:23] baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ and he shall be forgiven your
[1:20:29] sins for receiving the power of the Holy
[1:20:33] Ghost Hallelujah and when he said
[1:20:37] that one by
[1:20:39] one am am that's one Sheep
[1:20:43] amen that's another sheep am how many
[1:20:48] sheep one day 3,000 sheep were
[1:20:55] well by somebody who truly LED
[1:20:59] Jesus when you
[1:21:02] receive you love Jesus truly and if you
[1:21:06] love Jesus
[1:21:07] truly you are going to be
[1:21:10] concerned about the truth you can't keep
[1:21:13] it
[1:21:14] yourself the reason why you do not tell
[1:21:17] others about this
[1:21:20] message is because you do not have AG
[1:21:24] but if you
[1:21:26] receive you will tell others about this
[1:21:30] ENT message you will tell others the end
[1:21:34] is is
[1:21:35] sooner you will tell others that the
[1:21:38] rapt is coming soon you will tell others
[1:21:42] it's almost time
[1:21:45] over you'll be on
[1:21:48] fire for this
[1:21:50] message why because you have
[1:21:57] AG what is Philadelphia
[1:22:00] pH brotherly
[1:22:03] kindness an age of Brotherly
[1:22:08] Love what happened it was a missionary
[1:22:13] Edge because they loved one
[1:22:16] another they took the
[1:22:19] message all over the
[1:22:21] world if you understand that
[1:22:26] say wait until the Holy Ghost
[1:22:31] comes but before
[1:22:33] that you'll be
[1:22:37] selfish praise God many young men tell
[1:22:41] ladies I love you but because they want
[1:22:43] to defile
[1:22:46] them I love you when you get what you
[1:22:50] want you
[1:22:51] know why because it is f of
[1:22:55] love fth is not true
[1:22:58] love Romans
[1:23:00] 9 let's see something else
[1:23:03] here as it is written Jacob have I loved
[1:23:05] but es have I
[1:23:10] hated praise
[1:23:13] God everybody say praise
[1:23:16] God so you see Jacob have I
[1:23:20] loved but have I hated
[1:23:24] can you
[1:23:25] imagine who love
[1:23:28] Jacob who love
[1:23:32] Jacob
[1:23:34] Sorry God loved
[1:23:36] Jacob who
[1:23:40] hated God
[1:23:43] hated praise God but let us go to genes
[1:23:47] 25 vers
[1:23:49] 27 and the boys grew and Esau was a
[1:23:53] canning Hunter a man of the field and
[1:23:56] Jacob was a plain man dwelling in
[1:24:07] tents and Isaac loved
[1:24:11] is because he did eat of his
[1:24:15] venon Rea Lov
[1:24:19] Jacob hallelujah hallelujah so God
[1:24:22] hated
[1:24:25] who but
[1:24:27] apparently loved
[1:24:30] him Isaac
[1:24:37] LED
[1:24:38] remember why did Isaac
[1:24:45] love please read your Bible
[1:24:48] properly Isaac was a man of God
[1:24:53] he had a promise that God gave
[1:24:56] Abraham there is no
[1:24:58] way he
[1:25:00] had a wrong
[1:25:03] Spirit but he loved a man that God
[1:25:09] hated how can that
[1:25:12] happen is it
[1:25:14] possible what kind of love do we
[1:25:18] have are they loving with the same kind
[1:25:21] of love
[1:25:23] it is impossible if God loved if God
[1:25:29] hated he did not love him and the love
[1:25:33] of God was with
[1:25:36] Jacob not es and if Isaac was to
[1:25:41] love
[1:25:44] with he was supposed to love
[1:25:48] Jacob but apparently Isaac did not love
[1:25:55] Jacob but he loved
[1:25:58] is don't
[1:26:02] forget he did eat of his
[1:26:09] ven so you
[1:26:13] see will be connected to what you are
[1:26:15] getting in
[1:26:18] it I love you because you're Beau
[1:26:23] [Music]
[1:26:25] I love you because you're the best of
[1:26:27] the
[1:26:28] best if you have a reason why you love
[1:26:35] them and that's not the love God is
[1:26:37] telling us
[1:26:41] to God had no
[1:26:44] reason abely no
[1:26:49] reason no
[1:26:50] reason that God should love a sinner
[1:26:53] such as
[1:26:55] I what did I have what did I do what did
[1:27:00] I give you nothing but he yet loved me
[1:27:05] before I knew him and he chose me before
[1:27:09] the foundation of the
[1:27:11] world he loved you before you knew
[1:27:15] him nothing you
[1:27:17] do nothing you did that will separate
[1:27:21] that love of God
[1:27:24] you that love is not based on
[1:27:28] actions that love is bested on his
[1:27:35] desire bested on his
[1:27:38] will
[1:27:40] Hallelujah God loved you God loved me
[1:27:44] because he loved me he didn't love me
[1:27:47] because I was
[1:27:48] good he L me because he loved me
[1:27:53] oh how he love me I know not why I only
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:27:59] cry he loved
[1:28:01] me his love will even go for me when I'm
[1:28:04] in
[1:28:05] hell his Love Will Find me everywhere
[1:28:08] his love found me in
[1:28:11] sin found me in that
[1:28:13] fil his love picked me
[1:28:17] out brought me here hallelujah he cannot
[1:28:21] forsake
[1:28:22] he canot fa me he is
[1:28:26] faithful every promise he me was UN
[1:28:30] condition he gave it to me because he
[1:28:33] led me and that's the love of
[1:28:37] God and if you love
[1:28:40] somebody if it's with the love of
[1:28:43] God it is
[1:28:47] unconditional do this and I will love
[1:28:50] you I love you because you
[1:28:53] I love you because you have cash I love
[1:28:55] you because you know you're
[1:28:58] beautiful from a rich
[1:29:00] family because your feet looks nice eyes
[1:29:04] are so beautiful and everything

[1:29:09] going to have
[1:29:11] children
[1:29:15] not that's
[1:29:17] not
[1:29:18] that's
[1:29:20] feel
[1:29:23] it's
[1:29:24] not and that one will
[1:29:28] fail you can love even a
[1:29:32] sinner and want to marry them the F
[1:29:37] love
[1:29:40] but will not allow you to love a
[1:29:43] sinner to have them as a wife
[1:29:50] or praise
[1:29:55] God make you want to share the gospel of
[1:30:01] Salvation

[1:30:06] know and have what you
[1:30:10] have God's love is UN
[1:30:13] conditional it is perfect
[1:30:17] love and I want to finish with this
[1:30:20] quot praise
[1:30:22] God in the message he must be born
[1:30:26] again God the Great Master

[1:30:34] spirits of
[1:30:36] God perfect
[1:30:39] love now after perfect
[1:30:42] love

[1:30:50] from that's the love that you have for
[1:30:52] your
[1:30:54] wife if some man would insult
[1:30:58] her you would shoot his
[1:31:01] brains because it creates a
[1:31:05] jealousy but
[1:31:07] that's secondary
[1:31:10] love not
[1:31:13] important water done
[1:31:17] love then comes after there is a here
[1:31:22] then
[1:31:24] comes down

[1:32:09] that
[1:32:11] until they receive the power of the Holy
[1:32:14] Ghost it silences
[1:32:18] [Music]
[1:32:20] it
[1:32:26] then comes
[1:32:29] last after
[1:32:31] that comes
[1:32:37] fil it just becomes
[1:32:43] perverted what is
[1:32:45] f
[1:32:46] prostitution you find them they have
[1:32:49] nothing for one another but they just
[1:32:50] want to
[1:32:53] relax let off the
[1:32:56] pressure just go buy a PR
[1:33:00] here know because you want money not
[1:33:04] because you have lost that
[1:33:07] Ms and inject
[1:33:10] themselves so they can behave like
[1:33:12] maniacs or
[1:33:13] animals why it is the
[1:33:18] filth and some people call it love but
[1:33:22] it's all
[1:33:23] filth
