TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in that's why when a preacher comes you pray and you wait upon God so when you now come to speak we pra we say Lord I now take myself out of the way follow me closely now I now take myself out of the why because I don't want to speak my mind I don't want to speak my thoughts I don't even just want to read to you the word but we want a word when that word comes many times you all sited there you can say many times people have said that was for me some people even come to me and say Pastor it was like as if you had put me there and you were speaking about me everything was about what was that that was the words of God from the supernatural god making alive God quickening That Word of Life to your heart that is what we need many times when a preacher is preaching don't just listen as if you are hearing a story don't just listen as if you know he's just telling Bible stories you know when you come to the service be prayed up be Desiring to hear from God did you hear what I said hearing from God how can you hear from God when man is speaking because the words I speak to you are not my words they are real my words of so when it by inspiration you C it by inspiration and quicken in your life when you believe it and you do what it says brings the results are you following me now brother bam says here now notice here it is I want you to see it and get it now the word of God written word of God will defeat sat anywhere any time it is written everybody wouldn't have gifts Jesus brought it down to a place where those who do not have gifts that do not have very much Faith could just say it is written that is now the log it is written tell your neighbor it is written all scripture is given by inspiration of God for for reproof for correction for instruction in righteous name now the written word is the absolute now I can speak to you words by inspiration the word is absolute everything else comes to that nothing can replace or improve on the it is God's words and therefore it is final but now here comes Jesus I told you that Jesus was the living word he himself was the lust but he was the Living Word how many understand it say Amen the word became flesh so now the word was working are you following me the word was working but the people we are still looking to the logos the written [Applause] word and they missed the word which was living and walking among them and they fig that many believers they look here to the written words and they failed to see the word in their but here when the word was in their midst here is what it spoke such here is what he himself John 539 such the scriptures for in such the scriptures which which scures talking about these ones the Bible search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life let me ask you child where was eternal life in their working in their but they failed to see life and they went to search the scriptures but they couldn't find life let me tell you CH when you miss RMA many times you will miss the written word two people shall be in the service say God spoke to me and another one will say those things were very difficult but yet they were all listen to the what is the nature of your heart and they search the scriptures in them you think you will have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and you will not come to me that you might have life so Jesus is insisting here that the written word in itself not give life the written word simply testifies of the Living Word the Jesus had the words the of eternal life if you understand that say Amen the of etal Life Jesus himself walking in their midst he had the words of eternal life but for them they were sticking with the written words they fail to seek God in their midst do you know that if Jesus was here today he would say the same things he said in his word let me ask you a question why do you think we come to church why don't we just stay at home and read the Bible why don't you just listen to the T because this word oh my I wish I wish you would see it this word has to come out of the pages of the Bible and when it is spoken to you then it brings life when it's spoken to you I can you can read sometimes one time I came here in the church and someone told me I you preached about the same thing I was [Applause] reading it it became life to me what is that they Reed the REM one comes to you quickens that life that seed of God in and the word of God makes sense to you Jesus Christ here in the Book of John 6 says then Jesus said unto the 12 disciples will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life the REM the L simply testified of the person you know John 13 says the Word was God Jesus now had the words or rors of eternal life it doesn't matter how many times someone reads the logos word they had to hear the words that comes out of his those words now become the light of men those words now become life now let me give you another example these people had read for thousands of years the book of Isaiah which we read here many times 61 which says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the me he sent me to bind up the broken heart to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that abound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord I want you to now cut yourself from here [Music] and take yourself in the days before Jesus came I don't know which that was so let's say we are all now there prophet Isaiah has prophesied and these words are put on on the pages of the word the word which came out of God and it was written now these words have been read read many times over and over over and over but it did not make any sense until Jesus came when Jesus came on the he read the same word but this time he preached it he spoke it he Ed it and then he said this this scripture this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears are you hearing meaning this is no longer just L now the spoken word and when the word is spoken it must come to life Jesus said this day this scripture fulfilled in your ears meaning now I have Ed it to you is just no longer written I have taken it out of the pages of the world and have given it to your ears listen even when it came in their ears only those that had the heart receive it it came fulfilled to them but to others they still saw Jesus the son of the C but yet here he was Jesus the word made manifest Revelation inspiration and when you receive the word it comes to life in your own life hallelujah amen amen praise God when I'm preaching let me give another example I know right now I'm just going all over the place maybe I'll have to do this again so that I can uh take you a little bit deeper now here came Peter and Peter was uh speaking to a group of people who did not have the Holy Spirit these people were in the house of coreli and they did not have the Holy Spirit and Peter came and because the angel of the Lord visited him and told him go speak to those people and those people the angel of Lord also visited them and they said go call Peter there is something I want you to say please put your thoughts together here now he says go call Peter speak to us want to hear your word he says go call Peter to come and speak to you why because the word of God comes to life when it is spoken to a heart that is desired and these people were waiting they were waiting they were waiting and when Peter came he began preaching to them he was preaching Christ he was preaching Christ and then the Bible says the Holy Spirit came and fell upon those that heard the word you see that's why the gospel cannot be transported in any other way some people are saying we should only press play others are saying that you should only read the are saying many things but let me tell you the only way God transports the gospel it's by preaching the gospel by speaking the gospel when the gospel is spoken life comes and you amen even right now as you are hearing when you hear the word the word even if you feel it if you don't feel it this word amen begins to do work within your soul inside your soul there is a seed there is a jam of life that is dant but when the word comes upon the word that is spoken that Worden quickens it and begins to come to life imagine the people who were there and you know the preacher was preaching maybe they are quiet and then all of the sudden the power of the Holy Ghost come and they started speaking why do you think many times when you are feeling bad and then you begin hearing the word life begins to come you begin to feel better and what is that the word of God quickening that Peter and and and and ethopian they were in in The Chariot you know going and Philip came and told them the UN do you understand what things you're reading do you understand the L and and and uh the UN said how can I understand without an interpreter do you know how the Holy Spirit interprets his word through the word by being by the word being spoken to you and the word bringing that life so now the Bible says that this man Philip on that very scripture in the Old Testament what did he do to speak about Jesus the only thing you did was to speak Hallelujah the only thing you need is to be honor the spoken word is to hear the word being spoken and and and you know while he was hearing while he was heing as they were going that seed of of God in his heart was receiving life receiving life receiving life the more he had the more life came in the more he Hallelujah the more life came in and then when he saw water he did not wait for Peter to tell him rather for Philip to tell him come I baptize you when he saw water that jam of life in him had already received the word already known I need to be baptized immediately say here is water baptize me who told him the power of the real there is power in the spoken word hallelujah hallelujah oh my many times when I meet people for counseling some times as as a preacher you don't know you know this some situations sometimes are very hard very difficult and you meeting someone and and you know you are juggling to find out how to advise them and then you will maybe go to the logos work begin to read to them and then then then you put it aside you begin to to speak to them you speak you speak and while you as you are speaking this has happened to me many times the power of the Holy Ghost gives me REM and I begin speaking to the person directly it's not my thoughts it may not even be written anywhere in the Bible but it is the word for that moment for you let me tell you every believer needs that and that's why even we need that kind of preaching we don't come to church just for someone to read us the Bible or to give us the knowledge of the Bible we want that Spirit which wrote the Bible when that spirit of God comes down he takes the written word and puts life on them and then when you receive it as amen it works in your life and brings the result praise God hallelujah hallelujah one time I was speaking with a sister in Ethiopia and she was completely devastated she did not know what to do next and she told me Pastor if God doesn't do something I'm going for sure I don't know why I should ser ah when I heard that it smart my heart it smart my heart I felt so bad I really felt so it was speaking to her speaking to her and you know as I was speaking the ho Spirit came down and I began saying to her sister you're going to get a job in a very short time if it doesn't happen then I'm a false prophet now that did not come from me at that moment it was spoken for that moment if the sister would have said no been up to her but she received one thing I love about Ethiopian people they receive the word they're not like ugandans are not so but Ethiopians are better when the word is spoken amen amen I believe we need to do that also we need to do that you need to discern that moment when God is speaking to you one time brother bham was speaking and sister right brother had come from the squirrel and God had created squ three of them and so brother bam was telling the story had that and when she did she said Amen brother that is nothing but the truth amen ah God was happy and the word came out her right now speak ask anything you want oh my God I want such moments ask anything you want that is not written anywhere in the SC but you see it came at that moment a spoken word of God if it is a spoken word it carries the same weight that this one carries and it cannot fail just like this one cannot fail what is that it comes by the spirit which gives life if sister would have said brother where is that one written but brother bham said even if she had asked for $1 million it would have been there right away even if she had wanted anything she says I want a limosine hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah amen what what created the world the word amen what the Bible says there is nothing that is created that was created without the word and that same spoken word has the same power today that's why we should be people who believe that when a preacher is preaching many times we don't speak even the written word many times it is the remers of God spoken out to you when you when you hear it don't be D and receive it accept it but some people they are D to receive it but do you know what God loves want people who just come and snatch it amen I believe it and the sister said amen sister she said amen I just said you are going to receive a job in not many days sayth the Lord and she said two weeks they asked her how much do you want to she's the one who spoke if they tell you how much do you want to ear how much will you say that's what she said that's what she said whatever she thought was big and they told [Music] that Hallelujah now always when you come to church be sit on the edge of your seat when the word is being prern what is God speaking to me what is for me what is mine what is the REM of God to hear it you accept it you believe it it must happen it must happen but the problem many Believers don't believe or they hear but they don't agree but always snatch that word are you hearing me the power of the r when it comes to when when Jesus says my words are life which words do you think is talking about hey hallelujah amen what do you think is talking about [Applause] this some people think that when you teach the word and when you understand everything in here you are going to have eternal life M that's a big mistake listen carefully when he says my words are life he did not mean the logos word because it says the letter the spirit gives life so he's talking about the the son the children of God will always receive the REM everybody can read and they all do and they all interpret it in their own way a son a daughter of God always he the not their own interpretation even the Devil Himself he knows the L word he can even read it one time he was quoting it to Jesus it is written it is written it is written but when Jesus came you know what did he say he says amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word what word not the one you no not the one youting every that comes out of the mouth of Hallelujah the children of God must have more than the written word not something different something that makes the written word alive in our lives the devil can read this on but he will not understand that is why when he when he came to Jesus he was asking him if you be the Son of God if you be the Son of God cast yourself down it is written but listen the Bible tells me oh my God oh my God listen Jesus when he was baptized he went up straight away out of the water listen and the heavens were open are you are you following and he saw the spirit of God descending like a and lighting upon him and a voice the spirit of God the voice the words and a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son I am well pleased in whom I am well pleased let me ask you where was the devil when these words were spoken yet he came back around and he said if you be the Son of God he didn't have a revelation of the Hallelujah it was already spoken but he didn't understand but a true child of God a believe of the word will always receive a spoken word the spoken word is the original SE spoken word weakens your life and reveals Jesus to you personally the devil can Theos but he will remain dead nothing in there to Quicken it it takes the to Quicken the seed many can actually quote and many can preach but I'm afraid many people preach the logos that's why you see you can read properly and then you come and preach to us what you read but you know there are two types of preaching the first type of preaching is when you are lecturing to us you are lecturing to us you are just like a student goes to school and is taught the law of motion and you come back here they say you student come tell your friends what you have learned and then you begin the law of motion the law of motion everything you know is remembering what he learned and sometimes he can forget wait oh it says like this who knows the law of motion who can set it come and set the the law of motion the law of motion states that a body tends to continue in in Motionless acted upon by an external Force unless upon he learned that from school and today we have a lot of preachers who are preachers of the law they went to Bible school and what they taugh them is what they are coming to tell you but how does God call his preachers rather God comes and calls you by fire and when you come you are going to stand like fire it will not be your words you not amen hallelujah amen Paul said this he said the words I speak to you are not learned from Bible College it is not from man's Wisdom by the by the power of the Holy Ghost you know he was speaking the remas of God that is what brings life amen amen when the word of God Is Spoken the spoken word brings life that's why when a preacher speaking the remers of God is for your life you feel like jumping you feel like amen shouting you feel like claing you feel so good what is that it is the power of God the fire of God that follow the REM word and let me tell you when you receive the Rema word for you don't stay in your seat don't stay in your seat you are free to jump you free to clap your hands to shout Amen to be liberated that is why we are called Pentecostal Pentecostal means people of the spirit it's not people who are stagnated they have the letter but they have no Spirit we are people of the spirit amen you cannot separate emotion from the word it is impossible whever the word spoken brings an emotion praise God you see the M the word which comes out of the mouth of God how B when the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever you shall hear that he shall speak he will show you things to come the only spirit makes the word or the logos come to life people people who only have the logos without the spirit thereof they dead someone will come and ask you show me in the word where it says I should never drink show me in the word where it says I should not Mar more than it should be and then you are forced to be pulled such foolish talk but to you who has REM word you when you read these things you see more than what is there when you hear these things you hear more than is written you understand more than is written there many things we do as believers do you know the Bible says that when you receive the law of the spirit of Life In Christ you are no longer under the law of sin and death you are no longer under the law thou sh not thou sh not you don't need any to tell you do this do this don't do that you don't need those laws anymore why you have received the spirit of life that has quickened your soul that Holy Ghost will not allow you to drink beer anymore that Holy Ghost in you will not allow you to go in this that Holy Ghost will take you away that Spirit of life will Quicken you and give you new desires I give you new life and give you and change your mind you will think different why because you keep hearing another voice you always hear the REM hallelujah hallelujah sometimes when I preach here the preacher can say God bless and then someone go crazy they had another word the Holy Spirit made it real to them them and attached to their life you you had God bless you but God spoke to them maybe the devil was telling them that they are not blessed and they will not make it and that that at that moment when the preer says God bless you the holy spirit will make it you are blessed you are blessed you are not going to fall you are blessed they will hear something else and why can it not bring excitement there is a power in the he will show you things to come you don't need to hear anybody say it he will guide you into all truth he would he would tell you what not to do and what to do the Holy Spirit praise God it may be written or Unwritten let me prove that for just a moment Luke 2:26 and it was revealed unto [Music] him and it was revealed unto him the holy God that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord where was it written where was it written that Simeon will not die until he sees Christ was it the word of God was it the word of God how did he receive it let us examine this how did he receive it by Revelation now separate Revelation from your thoughts when you know every time God reveals something to me I get excited when God tells me go and do ABC one time I not the specifics but one time he told me to do something and I said hallelujah what Isen oh I said he SP whenever a revelation comes comes with excitement I believe one day Simon was there and the Holy Spirit spoke to you I don't know how he spoke I know he spoke maybe in his head in his in his ears I don't know but the says he sometimes you say something told me when I I was leaving when we were leaving Buddha one of the pastor's da came and spoke to me said pastor you know we going to she's one of the candidates as we going to sit uh as we were going to be prayed for dedicated no no before I came before went when they they were preparing that program she said you know something spoke to me that Pastor T should come want to dedicate us for this ex so I spoke to her that was the word of her father never knew but here it happen and here was Simon Simon walking about his own business he was an old man the Holy Spirit spoke to him you will not die until you see Jesus I believe you must have Hallelujah Hallelujah am what is wrong with you are you growing mad said no I know there's something I know there is something I re what is it I can't explain it even if I tell you I believe I am not going to die until the mesiah come Simon are you crazy no it is a word of God s where is it all I know God spoke to me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Luke 2:27 and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus how did Simon come into the temple by the I have a lot of excitement in my soul right now he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus my God let me that was out there in his but the Holy Spirit now came it is time in the temple did you know the Messiah no nobody knew it was top secret kept it as top secret no one [Applause] butwhere do you know what's going to happen to you tomorrow but God can give you rem that he will reveal to you everything about everything brother Bram before he passed he even knew how he was going to die he spoke it God revealed it to friends Simeon By the spirit comes to the temple and then the parents brought in the child and to do for him after the custom of the law then took he up in his arms then took he him up in his arms Simon said come here Jes who told him that this was the Mah Hallelujah no one knew not the Simon Knew by the he took him up in his arms and he blessed God and said Lord now let thou thy servant depart in according to th Hallelujah you spoke to me that until I see him I will not die now I have seen him now let me die in peace according to your word according to what you spoke to me friends we must be hungry for God to speak to us God speaks tell your neighbor God speaks our God is Not dump Our God speaks he speaks I said he speaks if you want him to speak in your life he can speak in many ways it may be in the church it may even be out there you may see a scripture with somewhere or somewhere but God will speak to youu through that someone may come to you and say something hallelujah amen I was working in Ethiopia in with my wife and a man who didn't know me he came quickly and he spoke to me and said wait wait wait I see a light over your head you are carrying a message it is a big message it's a bright message God is saying is giving you an Open Door in this country no one will stop and that man never believe the message but he brought to me the word when I heard it I said amen and the message is now in ethopia because God has to fulfill his word how did Brother come here same thing he came to me one time with my uh my wife we started our fellowship we were just starting home fellowship and God started sending people and one of them he he came to me at my dining table and spoke to me and my wife and said I don't I have try to fight it but I can't God has been speaking to me and my wife for us to move and support this Min I said my brother I believe in God speaking if it is God then follow his voice you don't even need to consult with and I tell you church God speaks when God speaks believe what he says but whatever he says will not break the don't come to us and tell us second what type of God is that God told me to have a girlfriend that was the devil not but when God speaks his will not defy his Lo praise God praise God H let us look at Acts chapter 5 then the high priest rose up and all and all they that went were with him which is the sect of the sades were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison but the angel of the Lord by Night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life amen here is an angel of the Lord coming where the disciples have been incarcerated and and he sets them free and he says go and speak the remas of this life don't ever play or joke with any preacher you know we can talk out there PR speaking by inspiration pay attention not him speaking it is God speaking when I'm preaching the word it's not your son preaching it's not your husband it's not your brother it's not your friend God speaking the rors of Life the angel said to them go and speak the of and when you receive it works in your life as we were praying today for these little girls and boys you know the Holy Spirit just plac it in my heart to call them and just to pray for them and you know there was a great anointing and as I spoke it wasn't my words it was the words directed by the power of you know it began to act upon these people wasn't my touch it was the words began to stuff to be delivered what that the word does that and listen God speaks to every to some people to everyone praise God brother bam says now let us go back off this modern day until a day that's passed let's go back let's go back to the days of the Early times and this voice of God has come to men in all walks of life in all ages no matter if you are a farmer if you are Sho cobbler whatever you may be God still speaks if you are sinner if you are prostitute if you are if you are drun a local church member nominal whatever you be the voice of God still waits to speak to you let me tell you why am I preaching this I'm creating a hunger within [Music] us for us to be able to hear from God many voices going around and people hear things but close yourself from The World God speaks God speaks through his his word God speaks through his preach God speaks through many ways and Here Comes Mary and when the angel of the Lord came to her and told her what she what he told her she said be unto me according to praise God that was written before but here it was being spoken God can take a word which is written and speak it to you because it's going to cause it to happen how many want a word from God Amen can you stand praise God and Peter fished the whole night he had toiled all night and they have taken nothing sometimes in the service church God can speak to you personally many times names are called here don't take it for granted when God speaks his word has to be ACC and always receive it and accept it with all your heart praise God [Music] oh in my heart I just desire to hear his voice oh Jesus praise God do you have
