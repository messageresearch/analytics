[46:39] today is a very important
[46:42] one especially for us as
[46:46] Believers and I'm just going to really
[46:48] ask you to follow
[46:51] through uh no need for you to move out
[46:57] you can really stay and and listen
[47:01] to some people say some portion is for
[47:04] another another portion is for
[47:08] another I believe every portion is yours
[47:14] tonight
[47:16] amen
[47:18] amen praise the
[47:20] Lord so I'm speaking on the subject of
[47:24] eternal
[47:25] life is living for
[47:31] others eternal life is living for
[47:36] others now even today there are many
[47:40] things you would have done for
[47:44] somebody but you did not do them because
[47:47] you asked yourself this
[47:49] question what is it need for
[47:53] me and the answer was nothing
[47:58] and then you decided not to do
[48:00] it I would not ask you to raise your
[48:03] hand but I'm sure that if I ask you to
[48:07] raise you may find that we have a lot
[48:11] of you will find that there are many
[48:13] people many
[48:15] Christians who do things because they
[48:18] benefiting personally
[48:23] individually you even find them
[48:26] ministering
[48:29] because they're benefiting
[48:32] individually you know you find them you
[48:35] know sweeping the
[48:37] church because they benefiting
[48:41] individually imagine you brother or you
[48:43] sister that has never swept the
[48:46] church if we are told you you are going
[48:49] to come and sweep the church and we
[48:50] shall pay you an amount of 500,000 a
[48:53] month
[48:57] I'm sure if I put if I put on a b board
[49:02] somewhere and we say that we we
[49:06] advertising a church
[49:09] cleaner amount
[49:13] 500,000 there are those who will not
[49:14] take the
[49:15] job but if we put 2 million there are
[49:19] those who
[49:20] would even me I can do it so you see
[49:23] it's not about the thing that you're
[49:25] doing that's benefiting us
[49:28] others it's about what you receiving for
[49:31] self-gratification
[49:35] but then if you are doing
[49:38] something and it is benefiting you
[49:41] individually you you are
[49:44] selfish and it's not benefiting
[49:47] others but as we shall see here a
[49:51] prophet told us
[49:52] clearly and I'm going to also show you
[49:54] through many scriptures
[49:56] eternal life is living for
[50:01] others you need to come to a
[50:04] place you need to come to a
[50:06] position whereby you are ready to
[50:10] sacrifice you are ready to do what it
[50:13] takes you are ready to get out of the
[50:16] way to do something even when you know
[50:19] you are not going to benefit
[50:23] individually it may be you're doing it
[50:25] for your relative
[50:28] or you doing it for your friends or you
[50:30] doing it for a stranger a to
[50:34] stranger I've I've been I'm one of the
[50:36] people that have you know been fed by a
[50:39] very angry
[50:43] generation angry not
[50:46] hungry you know whereby you can actually
[50:49] literally do something for
[50:51] someone and they will they can't believe
[50:54] it that you doing it for no private
[50:59] intention they will believe that you're
[51:01] doing it because there's something you
[51:03] are planning to do that will satisfy you
[51:05] as an
[51:09] individual because that's how you know
[51:12] it's it's been
[51:14] presented we have heard even the secular
[51:17] singers sing about
[51:19] it and they
[51:22] songs that nobody can have pity for
[51:26] another without a so you know everybody
[51:28] will believe how can he do that when he
[51:30] has no
[51:33] intention you know um I don't know
[51:36] whether I told you the story here but
[51:37] were
[51:38] just uh driving from a
[51:41] certain pastor's
[51:44] home and we were coming back home I had
[51:46] all my family in the house in the car
[51:50] sry and as we were coming we met a
[51:53] certain uh young
[51:55] boy sing maze it was a bit late at night
[52:00] maybe almost going to um 9 or 10
[52:05] 9:30 so it was a bit late for a school
[52:07] going a school going boy to be selling
[52:10] maze at that
[52:13] time so I I felt pity for him and I
[52:17] wanted to know I was interested to know
[52:19] his
[52:20] story so I asked him as we were taking
[52:22] fuel on the on the on the U machine
[52:28] and so I asked him a question I said do
[52:30] you go to school he said yes I go to
[52:32] school I told him which class are you in
[52:36] he told me the class I don't remember
[52:38] and maybe P5
[52:42] or uh these also can't remember the ones
[52:45] I was with so then I I told him uh so
[52:50] you so as I was still talking they
[52:53] finished putting
[52:54] fer so then I packed on the
[52:57] to listen to the whole
[52:58] story and so he said to me that um so he
[53:03] sells
[53:04] maze in the night in the evening from
[53:07] the from around when he comes back to
[53:08] school from around 600
[53:10] p.m. and he said sometimes he told me he
[53:13] he can you know go up to
[53:16] midnight because his mother you know
[53:19] Cooks this
[53:21] Maze and packs it for him so he cuts it
[53:25] on the head
[53:27] and then he doesn't go home until it is
[53:29] fully
[53:31] sold reason this is where how he makes
[53:35] his and so he told me of course while I
[53:39] was
[53:40] asking uh that so his father is dead and
[53:44] so he's an orphan and I as he was
[53:47] telling me the stories I was getting
[53:49] touched everything was
[53:51] saying and I felt I needed to relieve
[53:54] him so I told him
[53:57] now here is what we are going to do how
[53:59] much M do you
[54:01] have H he told me uh he showed me what
[54:04] he had he said he had the basket so he
[54:06] showed me the basket where it was quite
[54:09] plenty of it it was almost
[54:11] full and he had about you know 2 three
[54:14] hours to
[54:15] go and he remember he has to again go
[54:18] and sleep I don't know for how many
[54:19] hours and then wake up very early to go
[54:21] to
[54:23] school to me it sounded very
[54:27] very difficult and I know some of you
[54:31] have come from difficult
[54:35] backgrounds maybe like me maybe a few I
[54:39] don't know but I hope some of you and
[54:41] you know it can be quite difficult in
[54:42] such
[54:45] scenarios because um well I I not
[54:48] lengthen that but so I I so then when I
[54:52] as I was speaking to the boy I told
[54:54] him bring all your maze
[54:57] and I would like to buy all of
[55:00] it if I buy all of it would you be
[55:03] happy he look the whole time he was
[55:05] looking at me
[55:08] suspicious
[55:10] suspicious so he didn't I don't know did
[55:13] he think that I was lying to
[55:16] him so anyways he he showed me all the
[55:19] maze I paid it all and I I we took some
[55:24] and we give the rest of the border
[55:26] border men who were
[55:28] there the B Riders the motorbike
[55:32] Riders so they each of them now had a
[55:35] maze and they were Che and they were
[55:38] very happy and but for the boy he still
[55:41] looked a bit
[55:42] suspicious so I called him and I
[55:45] said uh um so how much do you do you pay
[55:49] for
[55:50] tution he told me his tution
[55:53] money and I told him I I said so so
[55:56] you've not paid
[55:58] anything he said yeah that's why I have
[56:00] to work late so that we can pay
[56:02] up so I I asked my wife for a piece of
[56:06] paper and a pen and I wrote my number
[56:11] and I told him take it to your mother
[56:13] and tell your mother to call me my
[56:15] intention was at least for only one
[56:19] time to support this boy with the
[56:23] tution at least for one time and I did
[56:27] not don't know that I had a lot of
[56:29] money but I wanted to do something
[56:32] kind to a stranger that I found in a
[56:36] position of
[56:38] need they never called me until
[56:41] today the reason I believe the boy must
[56:44] have been
[56:46] suspicious I I don't I I don't think he
[56:49] has ever met someone kind like that all
[56:51] his
[56:53] life and so I believe even if his mother
[56:56] had the
[56:57] story he must have told her him she must
[57:00] have told him it is too good to be
[57:04] true I believe you must have met these
[57:06] people who sacrifice little
[57:09] children so please my boy I want you to
[57:13] have knowledge in your
[57:15] head never do that kind of thing never
[57:18] do that again always when I give you go
[57:22] and say to people
[57:26] and bring the money after
[57:28] s so that way he lost his
[57:32] opportunity they lost their
[57:34] opportunity because perhaps they did not
[57:38] believe good people still
[57:40] exist but why did I begin with that
[57:44] story because I wanted to show you that
[57:47] we are living in a
[57:49] generation whereby almost people have
[57:53] become heartless
[57:57] people don't believe they can do
[57:59] something for someone when they are not
[58:01] going to benefit
[58:02] [Music]
[58:05] personally whatever you want to do you
[58:08] must make sure you're benefiting
[58:12] personally and if you're not benefiting
[58:14] personally you are not
[58:17] counted you just tell them don't count
[58:19] me
[58:20] in we want people who will come and
[58:22] sweep the
[58:24] church how much are we getting
[58:27] Don't Count Me
[58:28] In we are looking for people to do this
[58:31] and that how much are we getting nothing
[58:35] don't count me in but they want to be
[58:38] counted actually they you you would even
[58:41] have a number go go to people who are
[58:44] who you know call for
[58:48] interviews what I'm speaking today is
[58:50] very
[58:51] important and I'm praying that you'll
[58:53] give me your undivided attention
[58:56] if you go out they recently called when
[58:58] they were going to begin the population
[59:03] census and they called you know
[59:07] applications they had tens of thousands
[59:10] of
[59:13] applications and everybody is trying to
[59:15] see how can I get a job how can I get
[59:18] this opportunity others will even break
[59:22] others will do this others why because
[59:24] they are looking for that opportunity
[59:26] for
[59:27] themselves to get some money to get
[59:31] gratification to be satisfied it is all
[59:34] about
[59:36] self we are in a generation of self
[59:40] gratification you know people are doing
[59:43] things for
[59:45] themselves that's even why you find you
[59:47] know you know
[59:52] rap you you find rape you find
[59:54] prostitution
[59:57] you you find boys you know running after
[59:59] girls to use
[1:00:02] them dump them afterwards you know
[1:00:05] there's no commitment
[1:00:07] anywhere you find you know mothers who
[1:00:10] have children and they squeeze them out
[1:00:11] of their B Mur them before they even
[1:00:15] born and in countries like
[1:00:18] America they even say there's a whole
[1:00:22] political
[1:00:23] party called a democratic
[1:00:27] this one supports abortion
[1:00:32] open they even said they use it as one
[1:00:34] of the points of their of their
[1:00:37] campaigns they're saying a woman has a
[1:00:39] right on her
[1:00:42] body if she wants to up to
[1:00:46] her why you know it's all about
[1:00:50] selfishness you find they don't longer
[1:00:52] want to
[1:00:53] breastfeed why selfishness you know my
[1:00:56] breasts will fall
[1:00:58] down so I don't want to do that so they
[1:01:01] will buttered their
[1:01:02] children because they they are
[1:01:05] selfish they feeling that if I do this
[1:01:07] yeah the baby will be fine but I will
[1:01:09] look
[1:01:13] bad it is
[1:01:15] selfishness you see you see it's a
[1:01:18] spirit of the
[1:01:19] age you find that you know many things
[1:01:22] are
[1:01:23] happening like you know uh corruption
[1:01:26] is all about
[1:01:28] selfishness all these things that are
[1:01:31] really is I can call it the sickness of
[1:01:34] our Lan
[1:01:38] generation it is because people do not
[1:01:40] want to live for
[1:01:43] others but eternal life is living for
[1:01:49] others if you cannot live for
[1:01:52] others you do not have eternal life in
[1:01:57] but if you want to have eternal
[1:01:59] life you must have a heart like that of
[1:02:02] Jesus have a
[1:02:04] desire to leave for another
[1:02:08] person to do things for someone else to
[1:02:10] be
[1:02:12] happy that's where you find two two boys
[1:02:15] fighting over one
[1:02:18] girl or vice versa and no one is willing
[1:02:22] to leave it for the
[1:02:24] other many times while in counseling
[1:02:27] with young people I've told them
[1:02:29] this a prophet gave a
[1:02:32] scenario where there was um it was a
[1:02:36] hypothetical
[1:02:38] scenario and then he said if there is a
[1:02:42] you know a
[1:02:43] couple like a brother you know you have
[1:02:45] a
[1:02:46] sister and this sister you you really
[1:02:49] believe that she'll be your
[1:02:51] wife and both of you maybe you are
[1:02:54] almost in agreement to to make a
[1:02:58] decision and then
[1:03:00] eventually you know the sister comes and
[1:03:03] tells
[1:03:04] you brother I'm
[1:03:06] sorry you know but there's another
[1:03:09] brother you talk to me but there's
[1:03:12] another brother that I love better than
[1:03:15] you i' would rather go with
[1:03:18] him if you are a
[1:03:20] brother what would you
[1:03:23] do brother Marin what would you
[1:03:27] what the young men
[1:03:29] today they are willing to do anything
[1:03:31] and
[1:03:32] everything if they can't win the girl's
[1:03:36] heart they will rob
[1:03:38] it if they can't rob it they will
[1:03:41] squeeze it out and if they can't do that
[1:03:44] they will mess it up for him and for the
[1:03:46] other
[1:03:47] one at least if I can't take you let me
[1:03:51] go to the other one and I tell him how
[1:03:53] bad you
[1:03:54] are so that both of you both of us will
[1:03:56] lose
[1:03:57] it that kind of heart but our Prophet
[1:04:01] told us that you brother if you love
[1:04:04] that
[1:04:05] sister and and she tells you she loves
[1:04:07] another brother better than
[1:04:10] you what you should do
[1:04:12] brother is tell her you know what I love
[1:04:15] you and I want you to be happy so if
[1:04:18] you're happier with the other
[1:04:21] man that is all right by God bless you
[1:04:26] and may he give you a wonderful
[1:04:29] marriage you see what what what is that
[1:04:32] leaving
[1:04:35] fors if someone else is
[1:04:38] happy you should be
[1:04:41] happy now let us go to the
[1:04:43] scriptures so we see um we started with
[1:04:46] this scripture in Matthew 25 but we are
[1:04:48] going to read
[1:04:50] others when the son of man shall come
[1:04:52] now in his glory and all the Holy Angels
[1:04:55] with him shall he sit upon the throne of
[1:04:57] his
[1:04:58] glory so now here is speaking about the
[1:05:02] Lord coming
[1:05:04] down to sit on the white Throne
[1:05:08] judgment we we already talked about this
[1:05:11] in some other
[1:05:13] services and I told you that the white
[1:05:15] Throne
[1:05:16] judgment is not for the
[1:05:19] bride the bride is already uh in the
[1:05:23] Rapture and the Bride Comes Down to
[1:05:26] judge together with
[1:05:29] Christ but what we see here is um he
[1:05:33] says um and he shall separate them one
[1:05:37] from another as a Shepherd divideth his
[1:05:39] sheep from the
[1:05:43] gohost and brother emphasiz this
[1:05:46] part and he says he said listen he said
[1:05:50] these are not
[1:05:51] sheep and these are not the gods but he
[1:05:55] says why because he said as a
[1:06:00] Shepherd are you following me and he
[1:06:03] says in this time of of of History
[1:06:06] here we are not dealing with sheep and
[1:06:11] goats but he says as a Shepherd is
[1:06:14] giving an example as a
[1:06:17] Shepherd the people is going to deal
[1:06:20] with not sheep the Sheep is already in
[1:06:24] his flock
[1:06:27] that happened in the
[1:06:28] Rapture so the people is going to divide
[1:06:31] as a sheep as a Shepherd divide sheep
[1:06:33] and
[1:06:35] gods on the white thr judgment is going
[1:06:39] to be those that were in the tribulation
[1:06:41] and then came up in the
[1:06:45] resurrection and some who had died
[1:06:48] before the
[1:06:50] tribulation this is when all the dead
[1:06:53] rise
[1:06:55] books are open and another book is open
[1:06:58] which is The Book of Life and now they
[1:07:00] are beginning to be
[1:07:02] judged and they were judged according to
[1:07:04] their
[1:07:05] works so in a way this portion of
[1:07:08] scripture is really not speaking
[1:07:10] directly about the
[1:07:13] bride but when brother bam was speaking
[1:07:15] about eternal life being living for
[1:07:21] others he also quotes this portion of
[1:07:23] scripture
[1:07:26] and he uses it as an example that
[1:07:29] eternal life is living for
[1:07:32] others and so and you know he says also
[1:07:35] that
[1:07:37] scripture has compound
[1:07:40] meaning you find one scripture meaning
[1:07:44] this but also having another
[1:07:47] meaning so this evening I want us to use
[1:07:50] this
[1:07:51] scripture uh to speak of the things that
[1:07:54] we do
[1:07:56] and the life that we live and how it can
[1:08:00] pay
[1:08:02] off so let us look at vers
[1:08:07] 35 okay before that it says and he shall
[1:08:10] set the sheep on his right
[1:08:13] hand and the gos on the
[1:08:15] left then shall the king say unto them
[1:08:19] on his right
[1:08:21] hand Come Ye blessed of my father
[1:08:27] inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
[1:08:29] from the foundation of the
[1:08:32] world praise the name of the Lord
[1:08:35] Brother Sam I would appreciate if you
[1:08:36] can reduce the sterio just the sterio
[1:08:38] okay and he shall set the sheep on his
[1:08:40] right hand and the Gods on the on on the
[1:08:42] on the left then shall the king say unto
[1:08:44] them on his right hand Come Ye blessed
[1:08:46] of my father inherit the Kingdom
[1:08:49] prepared for you from the foundation of
[1:08:50] the world now they are going to inherit
[1:08:52] the king of course whenever is talking
[1:08:53] about the inheriting the kingdom
[1:08:57] he's is's talking about eternal
[1:09:00] life so now when he's saying inherit the
[1:09:06] Kingdom he goes listen he goes ahead and
[1:09:09] he gives the
[1:09:11] reason why they should inherit the
[1:09:15] kingom he says for I was
[1:09:18] hungry and you gave me meat I was
[1:09:22] thirsty and you gave me drink I was
[1:09:25] stranger and you took me in I was naked
[1:09:30] and he closed me I was sick and he
[1:09:33] visited me I was in prison and he came
[1:09:37] unto me and now the wrer
[1:09:40] said Lord when did we see you hungry and
[1:09:44] we fed
[1:09:46] you oh thirsty and gave you drink when
[1:09:50] did we see you as a
[1:09:53] stranger and we took you in when did we
[1:09:56] see you naked and we Closs
[1:09:58] you when did we see you sick or in
[1:10:01] prison and we came unto you now listen
[1:10:04] closely friends the the people who did
[1:10:07] these good
[1:10:09] works did not do it because they wanted
[1:10:13] eternal
[1:10:16] life are you hearing
[1:10:18] me they did it un
[1:10:23] knowing that they were doing it unto the
[1:10:28] Lord so the people we are talking about
[1:10:31] here my I wish you just get it we
[1:10:35] talking about a
[1:10:36] people that in them was something that
[1:10:41] made them do something for somebody
[1:10:45] else and they had no reason why they
[1:10:49] were but they just had a good
[1:10:52] heart they just had a good intention
[1:10:57] they were not saying let me do this so I
[1:10:58] can go to
[1:11:00] heav no they were not having that
[1:11:03] premeditated
[1:11:07] mind look at it this way you know if
[1:11:10] you're a
[1:11:11] donkey you will behave like a
[1:11:14] donkey if you are a cat you behave like
[1:11:17] a cat if you are sheep you behave like a
[1:11:20] sheep if you a
[1:11:22] cockroach I hope no one would say I
[1:11:24] called them a cockroach
[1:11:26] you behave like a whoever you are
[1:11:29] you behave like what your nature tells
[1:11:32] you to
[1:11:33] behave these people here had a
[1:11:37] nature they had a nature a life in them
[1:11:41] that desire to do
[1:11:43] good that desire to live for somebody
[1:11:46] else that desire to make someone's life
[1:11:49] better than
[1:11:51] theirs desire someone else to be happy
[1:11:56] but by so
[1:11:57] doing they did not know they were doing
[1:12:00] it for the
[1:12:02] Lord but they did it without a
[1:12:04] premeditated
[1:12:08] mind but some of you you even just help
[1:12:12] a brother with only small some small
[1:12:15] money and he will sing it all over the
[1:12:19] church everybody will
[1:12:21] know you are the one who helped the
[1:12:24] brother or the sister
[1:12:26] where where have we arrived
[1:12:29] at where is this aspect of eternal
[1:12:33] life leaving for
[1:12:36] others imagine visiting the
[1:12:39] sick you know when you hear a brother is
[1:12:42] sick or a sister is
[1:12:44] sick or someone is hungry they have no
[1:12:48] food and then just say God bless you
[1:12:50] brother may God provide for you may God
[1:12:53] increase you
[1:12:55] but you can't even go into your
[1:12:58] pocket you can't go into your pocket and
[1:13:02] give what you
[1:13:03] have this generation is very selfish
[1:13:07] president it is very
[1:13:09] selfish someone before they give you
[1:13:13] something they want to make sure that
[1:13:16] they also have
[1:13:19] it it is competition
[1:13:22] like someone is competing with another
[1:13:24] one
[1:13:26] H what if we help
[1:13:28] them it is their
[1:13:30] wedding but we may give them a lot of
[1:13:33] money and they they have a lot of Glory
[1:13:35] more than
[1:13:39] ours you see it is
[1:13:41] selfishness but when you me have even
[1:13:44] never done a
[1:13:45] wedding now I I give this
[1:13:48] one how am I going to benefit it is
[1:13:52] selfishness it is a spirit of the AG
[1:13:55] but the bride should go
[1:13:58] beyond amen we should know eternal life
[1:14:01] is Desiring something good for somebody
[1:14:06] else did you know when you desire
[1:14:08] something good for someone
[1:14:11] else God will give you
[1:14:14] better God will increase you
[1:14:16] more God will bless you more but we are
[1:14:20] the way we
[1:14:21] are we never change because we are
[1:14:27] selfish there is no
[1:14:29] Giver that I have never seen I've ever
[1:14:32] seen
[1:14:34] many every Giver is always having
[1:14:39] enough that's the
[1:14:41] LA if you want to receive you must give
[1:14:45] out but if you don't give out you will
[1:14:48] never receive you will always be poor
[1:14:52] you will always be needy you will always
[1:14:54] be wanting
[1:14:55] but the Bible says it is more blessing
[1:14:59] to give than to
[1:15:02] receive even if you don't have
[1:15:04] something actually if you want to
[1:15:06] receive more than what you
[1:15:09] need give out more than what you
[1:15:13] have amen am if you need a five
[1:15:17] suits give someone one
[1:15:20] suit don't give give a bad one get him
[1:15:24] the best
[1:15:26] and you remember you will get better
[1:15:28] than
[1:15:30] that more than that that's what the
[1:15:33] Bible says he says give and it shall be
[1:15:37] given back
[1:15:38] you there is even a way he calls it it
[1:15:41] says it in luganda it will be shed
[1:15:44] up it will
[1:15:46] be yeah and it will be overflowing are
[1:15:49] you hearing amen that's how you receive
[1:15:52] back that's how you receive back
[1:15:56] but if your heart is holding on to
[1:15:59] something if your heart is holding on to
[1:16:02] what you have there is no way you going
[1:16:04] to get more than what you
[1:16:07] need but if you want more than what you
[1:16:10] need then give what you have and give
[1:16:14] what you can
[1:16:15] give and some people are very busy and
[1:16:18] very good at
[1:16:20] asking they never want to give they want
[1:16:23] to ask they want to ask
[1:16:26] they want to be
[1:16:27] given they they can even preach to you
[1:16:30] to give
[1:16:32] them brother you should give and be
[1:16:35] blessed but you also need to be blessed
[1:16:39] so you need to give every one of us need
[1:16:41] to be a
[1:16:43] giver not only one person all of us if
[1:16:47] we all want to be
[1:16:48] blessed we all must be
[1:16:51] givers I said we all must be givers
[1:16:56] they don't only give
[1:16:57] money you give time we have seen here
[1:17:01] just visiting a sick person amen just
[1:17:05] giving food to a hungry person giving
[1:17:09] water to a thirsty
[1:17:10] person amen receiving a
[1:17:14] stranger and making them
[1:17:16] comfortable and taking care of them but
[1:17:20] many of us when we see a
[1:17:21] stranger we don't want to spend time
[1:17:24] with them
[1:17:25] some people come in the church
[1:17:27] especially on Sunday and you you are the
[1:17:29] one running away from them every Sunday
[1:17:32] you want to be close to a person you
[1:17:35] knew the brother you know the sister you
[1:17:38] know go to the
[1:17:40] stranger someone that is
[1:17:42] new love them before they love you give
[1:17:46] them love receive them maybe that is
[1:17:50] Christ
[1:17:51] visitting and you don't even have an
[1:17:53] idea
[1:17:55] you know the Bible actually talks about
[1:17:58] M when he came to Abraham he didn't come
[1:18:02] to the
[1:18:02] house he was passing
[1:18:07] by but he wanted to visit Abraham but
[1:18:12] what was he waiting for he was waiting
[1:18:14] for Abraham to receive
[1:18:17] him amen he did not say Abraham can I
[1:18:20] come in but he was just passing by just
[1:18:24] passing by and Abraham saw him he
[1:18:27] received a revelation this is a stranger
[1:18:30] he must be tired let me receive him amen
[1:18:34] Sarah was not even aware they were going
[1:18:37] to have visitors but Sarah had a heart
[1:18:41] also that was knitted with the heart of
[1:18:43] the husband to receive
[1:18:46] strangers these days when women receive
[1:18:49] visitors when they not expect them it
[1:18:53] can be very terrible
[1:18:55] you married sisters always receive
[1:18:58] Strangers In Your
[1:19:00] Homes people you never plan to
[1:19:03] have yes I understand the food you
[1:19:05] cooked is not
[1:19:06] enough but if he's a stranger and God
[1:19:10] has permitted him to pass your
[1:19:12] away I don't care who that man is he may
[1:19:16] be a believer or an unbeliever but let
[1:19:19] me tell you brother sister the prayer
[1:19:21] you were praying amen is being answered
[1:19:24] by this
[1:19:26] stranger receive them receive them
[1:19:29] joyfully and Abraham said hey can you
[1:19:32] pass our way and while they came Abraham
[1:19:37] opened his eyes and he did not know he
[1:19:41] was opening his arms to Jehovah
[1:19:46] God praise the name of the Lord praise
[1:19:50] the name of the Lord praise the name of
[1:19:52] the Lord he was opening his eyes
[1:19:55] to Jehovah God the creator of heaven and
[1:19:58] earth when he huged him he had huged God
[1:20:04] himself did not know amen oh hallelujah
[1:20:08] amen yes sir we see that God had mercy
[1:20:13] onam said God would have killed
[1:20:17] her when she
[1:20:20] said no and laughed in her heart
[1:20:25] when this stranger came and and and and
[1:20:28] Abraham received him the stranger began
[1:20:30] talking to Abraham and said you'll have
[1:20:33] a child this time the next year and sah
[1:20:37] was in the tent and sah had that but in
[1:20:40] her heart she laughed and this being God
[1:20:46] had what was in Sarah's heart and he
[1:20:49] told Abraham why did sah your
[1:20:51] wife and said God would have killed her
[1:20:56] there are many reasons brother bam gives
[1:20:58] but I give you a reason here another why
[1:21:01] God wouldn't kill her you know what she
[1:21:03] was doing she was very busy dressing
[1:21:06] some food for these
[1:21:10] visitors as much as she because of lack
[1:21:13] of faith or
[1:21:16] Revelation she did not believe in what
[1:21:18] the god
[1:21:22] Jehovah God did not take her life
[1:21:25] because of her
[1:21:28] works because of her good
[1:21:31] works hallelujah amen he did not know
[1:21:36] this scripture can apply
[1:21:38] to as a stranger you took me
[1:21:42] in and she received them she received
[1:21:45] them and when she received them God
[1:21:48] began opening her
[1:21:50] womb her womb which was dead many years
[1:21:55] God began opening again did you not know
[1:21:58] when you have some dead situations in
[1:22:00] your

[1:28:32] small I'm going to preach it until every
[1:28:34] believer who is supposed to hear it will
[1:28:36] hear
[1:28:41] it verse
[1:28:45] 37 excuse me then shall the righteous
[1:28:49] answer him saying Lord when did we see
[1:28:51] you hungry and and we fed you so it's
[1:28:54] not that you're going to see God in this
[1:28:58] person you may not even see God in that
[1:29:03] person but just do it anyhow just have
[1:29:06] the heart just have the
[1:29:12] attitude and the King shall answer and
[1:29:14] say unto them in as much as you have
[1:29:17] done it unto one of the least ones of
[1:29:19] this my
[1:29:21] brethren you have done itto me
[1:29:24] now friends let me tell you this other
[1:29:28] people say I don't
[1:29:30] give because people don't
[1:29:33] appreciate is that not true you can
[1:29:36] actually give to someone and they will
[1:29:39] begin slandering
[1:29:40] you using the same thing you gave
[1:29:44] them you give someone a
[1:29:46] microphone and he uses it to slander
[1:29:50] you it's possible so does it mean now
[1:29:54] because people don't
[1:29:56] appreciate you should not give you don't
[1:29:59] give because you want
[1:30:01] appreciation never give because you want
[1:30:05] appreciation give because you have a
[1:30:08] heart to
[1:30:11] give the more you give the more you
[1:30:14] receive but also when you
[1:30:17] give he says that you are giving unto
[1:30:20] the
[1:30:22] Lord even if it offering
[1:30:25] here you are giving unto the
[1:30:28] Lord land fund or tithe or offering you
[1:30:33] giving unto the
[1:30:35] Lord some people they would even say I
[1:30:37] don't I don't give money to
[1:30:39] church what do they use it for do they
[1:30:42] even need it I don't give my
[1:30:45] money I just use my money to to to buy
[1:30:48] food
[1:30:50] and you see they're more concerned
[1:30:54] about what the money is going to
[1:30:55] do because they're
[1:31:00] selfish they do not know whether what
[1:31:03] the money is going to
[1:31:05] do will directly benefit
[1:31:10] them
[1:31:14] directly if they are not too
[1:31:17] sure they will not give them but if they
[1:31:20] tell him we are collecting money for a
[1:31:22] wedding
[1:31:26] that why I'm going to go and eat my food
[1:31:29] I will go and eat my
[1:31:31] food and when they giving they say now
[1:31:35] how much can I give how much is the
[1:31:39] plate plate is
[1:31:41] 20 let me give
[1:31:43] 25 at least I 20 I'll eat it and
[1:31:49] five
[1:31:51] selfish friends when you give I would
[1:31:56] give
[1:31:59] yourself this principle
[1:32:01] Brethren is a principle to
[1:32:06] Prosperity we've seen many of these
[1:32:08] Pentecostal churches Even in our
[1:32:11] country they're growing and doing great
[1:32:13] big
[1:32:14] things we know they think that that is
[1:32:18] success but we know that is not but we
[1:32:21] also understand that our God wants us to
[1:32:26] prosper in things spiritual and in
[1:32:28] things
[1:32:30] physical and even if you a very good
[1:32:32] prayer
[1:32:33] Warrior even if you you come to church
[1:32:36] every day but you do not give canot
[1:32:40] Prosper you as an
[1:32:41] individual and the church will not
[1:32:44] Prosper if the church has people who
[1:32:46] don't
[1:32:47] give you know the more opportunities the
[1:32:51] more needs that come and announced
[1:32:56] here is is a more opportunity for you to
[1:32:59] get more
[1:33:01] blessings you know so whenever you hear
[1:33:03] an
[1:33:04] opportunity there is a need that's an
[1:33:07] opportunity brother sister run and give
[1:33:11] as much as you can now you don't give
[1:33:14] let me give let me now wait for the
[1:33:16] blessing that's not the attitude the
[1:33:19] people who received all these things
[1:33:21] eternal life
[1:33:24] they did not
[1:33:25] give let me I get it they didn't even
[1:33:29] know they were going to get it they just
[1:33:32] gave out of the abundance of their
[1:33:36] heart and even the people who did not
[1:33:39] give and did not get eternal
[1:33:42] life they actually did not know that
[1:33:44] they missed it because
[1:33:47] of when when God came in a form of a
[1:33:50] stranger to them
[1:33:53] realize it when when God came to them
[1:33:57] naked they did not realize it when he
[1:34:00] came to them
[1:34:02] sick they did not realize it when God
[1:34:05] came to them in form of someone in
[1:34:09] prison they didn't understand that God
[1:34:11] can do
[1:34:11] that hungry and
[1:34:15] thirst they didn't understand that and
[1:34:18] and in as much they miss eternal
[1:34:21] life Matthew 5:

[1:40:45] places and visit them give them
[1:40:48] literature do something for
[1:40:50] them well does it mean because we are
[1:40:53] looking for the rapture we shouldn't do
[1:40:56] this no eternal life is living for
[1:41:01] others you help a brother in church who
[1:41:03] does not have
[1:41:06] something instead ofing a brother that
[1:41:08] brother does not

[1:41:12] problem stop
[1:41:14] criticizing dig into your pocket get
[1:41:18] money from there tell him brother here
[1:41:21] is go buy a suit
[1:41:24] sister a
[1:41:29] dresses don't do you know
[1:41:33] sometimes these
[1:41:34] sisters who dress like that is because
[1:41:38] they don't have
[1:41:40] clothes I did not know
[1:41:43] before but as I continue to
[1:41:46] interact you can get
[1:41:48] surprised someone will tell
[1:41:51] you this and the other one is all I
[1:41:55] have then you're like oh God forgive me
[1:41:57] for
[1:41:58] judging say go buy yourself another and
[1:42:01] then you'll be so happy but if you just
[1:42:04] sit there and say that sister is very
[1:42:07] can look at how she's
[1:42:11] dressing sometimes it's not because
[1:42:14] she's
[1:42:15] canel sometimes it is because she
[1:42:17] doesn't
[1:42:19] have can you leave for her
[1:42:23] in the Book of Luke chapter
[1:42:26] 10 ver 30 and Jesus answering said a
[1:42:30] certain man went down from Jerusalem to
[1:42:34] Jericho you're going to read it and fell
[1:42:36] among Thieves and which stripped him of
[1:42:39] his rment and wounded him and departed
[1:42:41] leaving him half dead and by chance
[1:42:44] there came down a certain priest that
[1:42:46] way and when he saw him he passed by on
[1:42:49] the other side and likewise a levite
[1:42:51] when he saw he was when he was at the
[1:42:54] place came and looked on him and passed
[1:42:56] by on the other side but a certain
[1:42:58] Samaritan as he journeyed came uh came
[1:43:02] where he was and when he saw him he had
[1:43:05] compassion on him and went to him and
[1:43:08] bound up his wounds and powering in oil
[1:43:11] and wine and set him on his own beast
[1:43:13] and brought him to an in and took care
[1:43:16] of him and on the tomorrow when he
[1:43:19] departed he took out two pens and gave
[1:43:21] them to the horse and said unto him take
[1:43:23] care of him and whatsoever thou spendest
[1:43:26] more when I come again I will repay thee
[1:43:29] which now which now of these three
[1:43:32] thinkest thou was neighbor unto him that
[1:43:35] fell among the thieves and he said he
[1:43:38] that showed Mercy on him then Jesus said
[1:43:42] unto him go and do thou likewise amen
[1:43:46] you can read it
[1:43:52] also
[1:44:22] for for
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:03] amen amen amen now I want to see
[1:45:08] friends this is a parable of a Good
[1:45:12] Samaritan and this man fell into thieves
[1:45:15] stripped of his wounded and they
[1:45:19] departed and leaving him half day
[1:45:23] and by chance there came down a certain
[1:45:24] priest that
[1:45:27] way a priest came you would surely say
[1:45:30] ah a
[1:45:31] man is going to help him but what did he
[1:45:34] do he just came
[1:45:37] and I'm letting I'm late for
[1:45:40] church he didn't have time for the
[1:45:46] wounded I preached on go out quickly on
[1:45:50] Su
[1:45:53] and I want you to hear my
[1:45:56] burden we have a lot of
[1:45:58] people that are
[1:46:02] wounded by
[1:46:04] circumstances by the
[1:46:07] Devil family
[1:46:10] background lives they went through
[1:46:12] things they went through people are
[1:46:15] wounded they've been stripped
[1:46:17] naked and they are almost half dead
[1:46:23] but many of us what do we
[1:46:24] do we just go by pass by P them I don't
[1:46:29] know maybe they were thieves and they
[1:46:31] were beaten maybe they deserved it maybe
[1:46:35] we have a lot of psychology and theology
[1:46:37] in our
[1:46:38] heads why we should not help these
[1:46:41] people but the people are
[1:46:44] perishing they dying The Souls of
[1:46:47] men both spiritually but also
[1:46:51] physically many people who need God
[1:46:54] friends the god that we have received
[1:46:58] the God we have this message we have the
[1:47:01] message is a message of
[1:47:04] life if this is
[1:47:06] true what have we done
[1:47:10] about they there they're dying in
[1:47:14] bus they're dying in in
[1:47:17] nightclub they're dying you know in
[1:47:19] deceit of the enemy they're dying in
[1:47:22] prostitution
[1:47:23] they dying in
[1:47:25] immorality they're dying in the pride of
[1:47:27] life and all these things but we the
[1:47:30] church we are very busy only going to
[1:47:33] church going to church going to church
[1:47:35] no one is reaching
[1:47:37] out but where will the Good Samaritan
[1:47:40] come
[1:47:42] from we only are looking for things
[1:47:44] which will benefit
[1:47:47] us and you know the priest came and left
[1:47:50] the came and left but there came this
[1:47:54] one
[1:47:55] man A Good
[1:47:58] Samaritan and when he came down amen he
[1:48:01] saw him he quickly went to him amen and
[1:48:05] he he bound up his wounds the B says he
[1:48:09] had
[1:48:11] compassion
[1:48:13] compassion on him to have
[1:48:17] compassion means your heart goes out to
[1:48:20] someone who is in pain and suffering
[1:48:26] your heart feels for
[1:48:28] them you don't know what to do you don't
[1:48:31] even have enough
[1:48:33] yourself but your heart goes out to
[1:48:36] them and you feel like even tearing what
[1:48:39] you
[1:48:39] have so you can share with
[1:48:42] them and compassion he had compassion on
[1:48:47] him and went and and went to him and
[1:48:50] bound up his wounds and he powered oil
[1:48:53] and
[1:48:55] wine and set his him on his own
[1:48:59] beast and brought him into an
[1:49:01] in and took care of
[1:49:05] him and on the tomorrow he departed he
[1:49:09] left some money behind he said take care
[1:49:11] of him
[1:49:14] whatsoever he
[1:49:16] spends I'll pay I will
[1:49:20] repay praise the name of the Lord now we
[1:49:22] know that this I can we I preached on it
[1:49:25] before when I was preaching on Rescue
[1:49:27] the
[1:49:29] perishing and can be taken in different
[1:49:32] directions but tonight I'm speaking
[1:49:34] about this in regard to having
[1:49:38] compassion for
[1:49:42] people I don't know whether that is the
[1:49:44] right
[1:49:51] interpretation having passion for
[1:49:53] somebody
[1:49:56] else not to have crude
[1:49:59] Hearts selfish heart
[1:50:03] self-centered but to just have a heart
[1:50:05] for somebody
[1:50:08] else if you don't have
[1:50:10] something think about somebody who
[1:50:12] doesn't have what you
[1:50:15] have and I and I'll read a quote before
[1:50:17] I finish here in the message that day on
[1:50:20] Calvary then what does it do
[1:50:24] it gives you after that
[1:50:27] condition he it gives you his Spirit to
[1:50:29] follow him and do as he
[1:50:35] did he was just one
[1:50:37] man the perfect man he gave his life
[1:50:42] Jesus was our great
[1:50:46] Samaritan so he gave his life and he
[1:50:50] made an example for you
[1:50:52] you know how he came we even have many
[1:50:55] songs we sing in
[1:50:56] him he came down from
[1:50:59] Glory a believing story my God and my
[1:51:02] savior came he came from Glory came down
[1:51:06] for a stranger such as I he lived for me
[1:51:10] he died on the cross he was beat for me
[1:51:14] he has gone all these things through for
[1:51:16] me for me he died for me he played for
[1:51:19] me he suffered are you hearing Church
[1:51:22] for me he went through all these
[1:51:25] things and he said he gave his
[1:51:29] life he was just one man one perfect man
[1:51:34] he gave his life he made an example for
[1:51:40] you so what must we do then we must do
[1:51:44] the same thing for
[1:51:46] others that he did for
[1:51:49] us now the first thing I want to say is
[1:51:53] Jesus never lived for
[1:51:55] himself and I told you before if you
[1:51:58] live for
[1:52:00] yourself it fulfills
[1:52:03] you but there is no
[1:52:06] reward and if you leave for others many
[1:52:09] times they will disappoint
[1:52:12] you we will see it here Jesus never
[1:52:15] lived for
[1:52:16] himself his life was spent for
[1:52:20] others I just don't know about you but I
[1:52:23] want my
[1:52:25] life to be spent for
[1:52:28] others I want this to be my life's
[1:52:32] purpose I want this to be you know what
[1:52:35] I will be remembered
[1:52:38] for when maybe if the Lord
[1:52:41] ties and I'm long gone that I will be
[1:52:44] remember that my life was spent for
[1:52:50] others that's perfect eternal
[1:52:54] life when you say you go to
[1:52:57] church and you do good things that is
[1:53:01] fine but when you live your life to
[1:53:06] yourself you haven't eternal
[1:53:08] life eternal life is living for
[1:53:14] others it proved it when it come to the
[1:53:17] Lamb of
[1:53:20] God he lived and had eternal
[1:53:25] life because he did not live for
[1:53:28] himself he lived for
[1:53:31] others and he receive eternal
[1:53:34] life by receiving that day on
[1:53:39] Calvary and you don't live for yourself
[1:53:41] no
[1:53:42] more you live for
[1:53:45] others someone said how can you stand
[1:53:48] let anybody call you such a bad names
[1:53:56] you don't live for
[1:53:57] yourself you live for others that you
[1:54:00] might redeem that
[1:54:03] man I don't live for myself I live for
[1:54:07] others that I may redeem that man that
[1:54:11] woman that boy that girl I don't care
[1:54:14] what they call me you know what they
[1:54:16] called our lord Jesus they called him
[1:54:19] all sorts of
[1:54:20] names but he was leing for
[1:54:23] them regardless of what they called him
[1:54:27] regardless of how they treated
[1:54:28] him amen sister or brother if you ever
[1:54:32] do something for
[1:54:33] someone and you called all sorts of
[1:54:36] things you are in good
[1:54:39] company because even Jesus our lord went
[1:54:43] through
[1:54:45] it that you might redeem that
[1:54:47] man you become
[1:54:50] sons and the trouble of it is
[1:54:53] the church has forgot they were
[1:54:56] Sons you are a son you are taking
[1:54:59] Christ's
[1:55:00] place you a son you don't live for
[1:55:04] yourself you are living for
[1:55:07] others where brother B can leave for
[1:55:09] this brother because he is sure a nice
[1:55:13] man that's not
[1:55:16] it leave for that man who hurs
[1:55:20] you leave for that person who would kill
[1:55:23] you if they
[1:55:25] could I wonder how many can say Amen to
[1:55:30] this leave for that person who would
[1:55:33] kill you if they
[1:55:36] could that's what they done to him they
[1:55:40] killed him he died that he might save
[1:55:45] them that is eternal
[1:55:49] life when you that's in your awesome you
[1:55:53] are facing heaven
[1:55:56] then but you sacrifice your own
[1:55:59] things you give them up like the sheep
[1:56:03] gives its
[1:56:05] wool and you look
[1:56:09] on and you look on towards
[1:56:12] [Music]
[1:56:17] Calvary I hope this helps you to get in
[1:56:19] a place
[1:56:22] what the Tabernacle that's what all
[1:56:23] people has to has got to
[1:56:28] do that's what DF all of
[1:56:32] us do I have 100% agreement in
[1:56:36] that is find out what you
[1:56:39] are and what's the
[1:56:41] purpose church is going to chur church
[1:56:46] just um Church isn't just going to
[1:56:48] church to play music
[1:56:53] sing songs church is a place where
[1:56:56] correction judgment begins at the house
[1:56:58] of
[1:57:00] God and we must recall ourselves dead
[1:57:02] and alive to
[1:57:05] Christ he made the way that we could
[1:57:08] sacrifice ourselves to his
[1:57:13] service oh God may you give us this
[1:57:15] Revelation just sacrifice
[1:57:18] ourself
[1:57:20] ourself to his
[1:57:23] service to follow him you're going to be
[1:57:26] so
[1:57:27] Restless you want to find what can I do
[1:57:31] can I take care of the church
[1:57:33] flowers what can I do can I clean the
[1:57:37] church what can I do what can I do his

[1:58:00] do are you following
[1:58:04] me I will follow
[1:58:07] him we lead the life that he
[1:58:11] lived Jesus said and spoke of
[1:58:15] it let me just give you a few quotations
[1:58:17] on
[1:58:18] it listen close don't miss it
[1:58:22] said that that day he would separate the
[1:58:24] people like the sheep and the
[1:58:29] gods and he would say to the god stand
[1:58:31] on the left
[1:58:33] side and to the ship stand on the right
[1:58:36] side and he said to the gods depart from
[1:58:39] me because I was hungry and you didn't
[1:58:40] feed
[1:58:42] me I was in prison and you didn't visit
[1:58:45] me I was naked and you didn't clothe
[1:58:48] me and I was thirsty you gave me no
[1:58:50] drink
[1:58:52] I was sick and you didn't visit me so
[1:58:55] depart from
[1:58:57] me and on the ship he said I was hungry
[1:59:02] and you fed me I was naked and you gave
[1:59:06] me clothing I was sick and minister to
[1:59:09] me and noce don't fail to get this
[1:59:13] church keep this in your heart
[1:59:18] forever it was so unconsciously
[1:59:27] done I don't know how many got
[1:59:31] done said keep this in your heart
[1:59:35] for it was so
[1:59:40] unconscious mean their heart was just
[1:59:45] good the people don't do it for line of
[1:59:51] duty a man that gives you something
[1:59:53] another because he ought to do it a man
[1:59:55] that feeds you because you ought to do
[1:59:56] it no he's got a selfish
[2:00:04] idea it should be your very
[2:00:07] life it should be a very
[2:00:10] action you know you do something not
[2:00:13] because you have to do
[2:00:15] it you are doing it because it is your
[2:00:19] life I is your life
[2:00:22] it is your very
[2:00:24] action it is you your life that's how
[2:00:26] you
[2:00:27] are but how can it be if you don't have
[2:00:29] the Life of Christ in
[2:00:33] you it was so surprising to this
[2:00:37] sheep that they said Lord when were you
[2:00:39] angry and we feed
[2:00:42] you when were you angry and we fed
[2:00:45] you when we you naked and we give you
[2:00:49] cres and thiry and give you drink
[2:00:52] seek and minister to
[2:00:54] you praise the name of the Lord maybe
[2:00:57] sometimes you may hear brother is not
[2:00:59] doing well sister so so is or whatever
[2:01:04] don't just walk away at home I'm not
[2:01:06] very close to that sister I'm not very
[2:01:08] close to
[2:01:10] that give them a call visit if they in
[2:01:14] the
[2:01:15] hospital send them some money do
[2:01:18] something kind to that brother
[2:01:20] sister you were so automatically out of
[2:01:28] love your life lived in
[2:01:34] them God let the people see what Calvary
[2:01:37] did for us so
[2:01:42] automatically Jesus didn't do these
[2:01:44] things because he thought I have to do
[2:01:46] it it was his life it was his nature
[2:01:51] even if not want to die he felt I had to
[2:01:54] do it because I was born to
[2:01:58] die I was born to sacrifice
[2:02:01] myself for my
[2:02:04] brethren that is the same way we are
[2:02:06] born for what for living to leave for
[2:02:08] others your brother your
[2:02:13] sister someone oh
[2:02:15] Hallelujah someone you are not born
[2:02:18] with someone you have no blood
[2:02:20] connection
[2:02:22] someone Hallelujah that you don't even
[2:02:24] know will ever help
[2:02:26] you you do something for
[2:02:29] them in return there is a reward
[2:02:33] Brethren that's why I always say your
[2:02:35] real brother is your brother in the
[2:02:37] house of the
[2:02:41] Lord this is your
[2:02:44] family this is your family your family
[2:02:48] is not out there where you were born
[2:02:50] from
[2:02:52] you have families those that you will
[2:02:53] spend Heaven eternity
[2:02:57] we and amen we are born here and we have
[2:03:00] the same life that's why when something
[2:03:03] happen you feel oh this is my brother my
[2:03:07] sister I have to be there for
[2:03:09] them it's more than a
[2:03:12] responsibility it is so
[2:03:15] automatic it is a
[2:03:18] life when were you Lord when you when we
[2:03:22] never knew
[2:03:24] that Look what Jesus stand and said in
[2:03:29] in so much as you have done unto this
[2:03:31] you did it unto
[2:03:34] me unselfish
[2:03:39] life not the second
[2:03:42] thought not to think about it but you
[2:03:45] are so dead to the things of this
[2:03:49] world and you are so alive in
[2:03:53] Christ and so walking on on the highway
[2:03:56] that these things are just an automatic
[2:04:01] thing you just do it not saying well now
[2:04:05] Lord would I
[2:04:07] want now would Lord want me to do
[2:04:13] that it's not that you are just a part
[2:04:16] of
[2:04:17] him his spirit is in you and you act the
[2:04:21] way he
[2:04:22] [Music]
[2:04:25] acted do you get it you act the way he
[2:04:33] acted and I want to finish with
[2:04:35] Galatians
[2:04:37] 6 be not deceived God is Not
[2:04:42] mocked for whatsoever man
[2:04:45] SS that shall he also reap for he that
[2:04:48] sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
[2:04:50] corruption
[2:04:53] but he that Seth to the spirit shall of
[2:04:55] the spirit reap life
[2:04:59] Everlasting and let us not be
[2:05:02] weary in
[2:05:05] wello for in due
[2:05:07] season we shall reap if we faint not as
[2:05:12] we have there
[2:05:15] opportunity as we have
[2:05:19] opportunity let us do
[2:05:22] good unto
[2:05:26] all all
[2:05:29] men
[2:05:31] especially unto them who are of the
[2:05:37] hous whatsoever a man
[2:05:41] Seth that shall a man
[2:05:44] reap life is like planting a
[2:05:49] field let us plant good seeds
[2:05:53] let us plant good seeds whatever you
[2:05:56] saw it shall come back to you maybe you
[2:05:59] were never born with that
[2:06:01] person maybe you don't even have a
[2:06:03] relation to
[2:06:04] it don't say oh no me I give I give to
[2:06:07] my children I give to my wife that's
[2:06:10] what I'm talking about that's a
[2:06:14] responsibility that's a
[2:06:15] responsibility that's even why when you
[2:06:17] want to pay
[2:06:20] tithe you you you cannot say well I
[2:06:24] already gave the
[2:06:25] poor I gave them my tithe your tithe is
[2:06:29] to the
[2:06:31] Lord is not for you to help the
[2:06:34] poor help the poor from your own
[2:06:38] money after giving your ti as an
[2:06:41] offering then from out of what you
[2:06:44] have out of the abundance of your
[2:06:47] heart s into someone's life
[2:06:52] there are people in this
[2:06:54] life who have really lived a life for
[2:06:59] others when you look at their
[2:07:02] life they just
[2:07:05] Prosper not only the spiritual things
[2:07:08] but also in the
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:10] physical they're just like that many of
[2:07:13] you I'm sure you have
[2:07:17] examples leaving for
[2:07:20] others is a
[2:07:22] secret that the devil has
[2:07:25] blinded from many
[2:07:28] Christians in the uh in the age of John
[2:07:33] wisley
[2:07:35] Philadelphia many Believers many
[2:07:38] Christians gave up their family their
[2:07:41] wives their children and I told them I'm
[2:07:45] going to India I'm going to Africa I'm
[2:07:47] going if I don't come
[2:07:49] back we shall meet on the
[2:07:53] and sister Angela they were not going
[2:07:55] for
[2:07:56] work they were
[2:07:58] going to leave for others and give them
[2:08:02] the
[2:08:06] gospel they were going to give them the
[2:08:10] word and by so
[2:08:12] doing by what they
[2:08:15] did praise the name of the Lord by what
[2:08:18] they
[2:08:19] did as they were doing
[2:08:22] many of them
[2:08:24] die but there a
[2:08:27] reward and because of what they did we
[2:08:30] have the gospel in
[2:08:32] Africa the whole church in Africa is
[2:08:34] because of those
[2:08:36] missionaries so we are here because of
[2:08:39] them we even we know we sing a song it's
[2:08:41] dripping with
[2:08:43] blood yes it's dripping with
[2:08:45] blood the gospel is dripping with blood
[2:08:49] many men and women have given themselves
[2:08:52] for this Holy Ghost
[2:08:53] Gospel and by preaching this
[2:08:56] message I I I don't believe that we
[2:08:58] should take
[2:09:08] advantage you know you understand sister
[2:09:12] Esther does
[2:09:14] decoration and then you tell our sister
[2:09:16] come and do decoration for
[2:09:18] me and then when it comes time for
[2:09:20] payment
[2:09:22] you're like ah sister leave for
[2:09:25] me just God will bless you I don't
[2:09:28] believe in
[2:09:30] that there are many believers who use
[2:09:32] other believers and they don't
[2:09:35] pay you are getting yourself a
[2:09:38] cast if you use somebody and they give
[2:09:41] you a service and they don't pay and you
[2:09:44] are a member of this church you are
[2:09:47] getting yourself
[2:09:48] cast the the Bible even speaks about
[2:09:51] about that you know employing somebody
[2:09:55] and you don't pay them the Bible
[2:09:57] actually says pay them while they still
[2:09:59] have their
[2:10:01] sweat pay them while they still have the
[2:10:06] sweat are you hearing me but many
[2:10:11] believers they don't want to do that let
[2:10:14] me get you the
[2:10:18] scripture praise the name of the Lord
[2:10:23] theonomy 24 I will end with that very
[2:10:26] important for me to end with
[2:10:35] this
[2:10:39] 24
[2:10:44] 15 let us begin with vers
[2:10:49] 14 Thou shalt know not oppress unhired
[2:10:52] servant that is poor and needy whether
[2:10:56] he be of thy Brethren or of thy
[2:10:58] strangers that are in thy land within
[2:11:00] thy
[2:11:14] Gates you see you have a
[2:11:17] housemate you know here in Uganda many
[2:11:19] families have housemates
[2:11:23] and you find a house a home where they
[2:11:26] oppress
[2:11:28] them because they a
[2:11:31] housemate when others are sitting on the
[2:11:33] dining
[2:11:34] and for them they sit in the corner
[2:11:36] there in the
[2:11:38] kitchen when others are eating a good
[2:11:40] meal she's the one who cooks
[2:11:43] it but they actually go and give up
[2:11:46] beans when they're eating
[2:11:49] meat because house
[2:11:52] you know and and when it comes to
[2:11:54] payment many people in Uganda here they
[2:11:58] never pay
[2:11:59] housem never you find that they will
[2:12:02] make them work and they do a lot of work
[2:12:05] and when it comes to payment instead of
[2:12:07] giving them 50 they will pay them 20
[2:12:11] instead of paying them 100 as they agre
[2:12:13] they're giving them 30 and and this is
[2:12:15] someone with the
[2:12:18] money just even some of this workers
[2:12:21] security guards and
[2:12:23] other that some of them were even
[2:12:25] getting
[2:12:26] crazy and they were saying they don't
[2:12:28] know that we have the gun we can shoot
[2:12:31] them and actually one of them I think
[2:12:33] shot his boss because they're not
[2:12:36] getting paid and they are being
[2:12:38] oppressed by their bosses and the man
[2:12:40] will tell you that man is
[2:12:42] bad he's a bad man and if you a Believer
[2:12:45] and they give such a testimony on
[2:12:48] you you will not make it to heaven until
[2:12:51] you
[2:12:52] repent if you have any work or you are
[2:12:55] having anyone work for you you must
[2:12:58] always pay them and you must never
[2:13:02] oppress
[2:13:04] them as a matter of fact pay them more
[2:13:06] than what you
[2:13:09] agreed vers
[2:13:12] 15 H at his day at his day Thou shalt
[2:13:17] give him his higher neither shall the
[2:13:19] sun go down upon it for he is poor and
[2:13:22] Seth his heart upon it lest he cry
[2:13:25] against thee unto the Lord and it shall
[2:13:27] be seen unto
[2:13:45] thee so this is someone who is
[2:13:47] poor and is working for you and at the
[2:13:51] end of the day when the day arrives you
[2:13:54] tell them I'll pay you next week I'll
[2:13:57] pay you next week I'll pay you next
[2:14:00] week it is a sin and unless you repent
[2:14:05] you can't make
[2:14:06] it do you mean that Pastor yes the Bible
[2:14:09] says it will be a sin unto you Sinners
[2:14:12] are not going to go to
[2:14:14] heaven Sinners can't make it it's only
[2:14:17] the perfect be perfect as he is perfect
[2:14:22] by leaving for others and someone did
[2:14:25] you know that Believers must actually
[2:14:28] pay their workers on the same day they
[2:14:34] agreed if you can't dismiss them you
[2:14:38] can't pay them but if you are still
[2:14:40] having someone working for you and you
[2:14:45] agreed you you they must pay you or you
[2:14:47] must pay them on this debt
[2:14:51] then you must pay them as
[2:14:53] agree on the same
[2:14:55] day the sun should not go
[2:14:58] down because this man is poor this woman
[2:15:01] is poor and he's setting all his heart
[2:15:04] to this
[2:15:06] money is doing your work so you can pay
[2:15:09] him so if you don't pay him the Bible
[2:15:14] says they will cry to the Lord and when
[2:15:17] they do it will become a sin
[2:15:22] and so if some of you have been doing
[2:15:24] this kind
[2:15:25] of you even have to repent you have to
[2:15:28] repent sincer and change your ways I've
[2:15:31] had I've had Dr come to my
[2:15:36] house before when they were still living
[2:15:40] closer he was working at a clinic in a
[2:15:43] in a in a hospital here in
[2:15:47] ch so you would come at home and um
[2:15:51] uh he you know maybe checking blood for
[2:15:55] children and prescribing some
[2:15:57] medicine and then I asked him how much
[2:15:59] is it that you have worked know it's all
[2:16:02] right it's all right you are my pastor
[2:16:04] I'm just serving God I said oh thank you
[2:16:07] my brother God bless you and then
[2:16:10] afterwards I will pay
[2:16:12] him more than I knew he
[2:16:17] needed he served I blessed him but I
[2:16:20] also paid him for his
[2:16:22] labor the Bible tells us to pay our
[2:16:25] workers for their
[2:16:28] labor that's even why we pay
[2:16:31] tith we are paying for the ministry to
[2:16:35] continue ministering to
[2:16:38] us because our
[2:16:40] 10% goes to support doesn't go to
[2:16:43] construction it doesn't go to build
[2:16:46] anything it goes to support the ministry
[2:16:49] of the word
[2:16:52] that's the purpose and and and the Bible
[2:16:54] says don't do not Mule the
[2:16:56] ox that Tre the
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:08] corn praise the name of the
[2:17:11] Lord hallelujah hallelujah let's just
[2:17:13] read that verse um because he cannot get
[2:17:16] the the the
[2:17:19] translation in the book of Deuteronomy
[2:17:21] CH
[2:17:24] 25 uh vers
[2:17:28] 4 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he
[2:17:32] treadeth out the
[2:17:35] corn
[2:17:43] and is that verse
[2:17:45] completed it's
[2:17:49] completed yeah it is it is it is trading
[2:17:52] the the is
[2:17:54] digging it's working for you and then
[2:17:58] you
[2:18:00] just you begin
[2:18:02] mistreating Apostle Paul pulls that
[2:18:06] scripture and he uses it in talking
[2:18:09] about
[2:18:11] servants in connection to
[2:18:14] preachers who preach the gospel how they
[2:18:17] should reap the physical things from
[2:18:19] you just like give you the
[2:18:22] spiritual and it's the same way also
[2:18:24] with our
[2:18:25] workers because a pastor or a preacher
[2:18:28] is supposed to be a labor is working
[2:18:32] for okay now let us take that
[2:18:34] interpretation in the book of 1 Timothy
[2:18:36] Chapter
[2:18:44] 5 this just came up I had not prepared
[2:18:46] to but I think
[2:18:51] 1 Timothy chter
[2:18:53] 5 ver
[2:19:01] 17 let the elders that rule well be
[2:19:04] counted worthy of double honor
[2:19:05] especially they that labor in the word
[2:19:07] and
[2:19:19] Doctrine for the T says Thou shalt not
[2:19:22] musle the ox that treadeth out the corn
[2:19:25] and the laborer is worthy of his
[2:19:37] reward so you see you need to pay your
[2:19:41] labor don't mistreat your car or the the
[2:19:45] the ox that is working for
[2:19:48] you just like you love your pastor you
[2:19:50] pray for him and you pay your
[2:19:53] ti to support the cause
[2:19:56] and in the same way if you have a worker
[2:19:59] in your
[2:20:00] house you must do the same love
[2:20:04] them you
[2:20:07] knowk them for the good work they them
[2:20:11] the full of the
[2:20:13] agreement the same
[2:20:16] day asement
[2:20:20] are rules that Believers
[2:20:26] follow even when you have a
[2:20:29] company to those of you have businesses
[2:20:33] listen you have to pay your workers as
[2:20:36] per
[2:20:38] agreement there are some companies that
[2:20:40] take so
[2:20:42] long and you work and you have paid the
[2:20:45] following
[2:20:46] month after two months you have already
[2:20:49] used the money
[2:20:52] again Believers should never do like
[2:20:56] that as much as yes life is living for
[2:21:00] others on this other side you should not
[2:21:04] make someone
[2:21:06] labor and you don't pay
[2:21:09] them because you are leaving for
[2:21:13] them God bless you that stand
[2:21:18] feet I just trust that that little
[2:21:20] sharing has been a blessing to you
[2:21:24] all and uh if some of you have been you
[2:21:28] know found wanting in some
[2:21:32] area correct it right
[2:21:35] away and the Holy Spirit will help
[2:21:38] you to be able to do
[2:21:43] that amen
[2:21:46] [Music]
[2:21:58] I'd like us to pray
[2:22:01] [Music]
[2:22:05] and if you have something that you'd
[2:22:08] like to present before the
[2:22:12] Lord please do that as we pray
[2:22:16] together our dear Lord we want to thank
[2:22:18] you so much for the service this evening
[2:22:24] little things that we have
[2:22:26] shared they're very
[2:22:28] important father for every hearer I'm
[2:22:30] praying for them
[2:22:31] today that this would not be a judgment
[2:22:33] to
[2:22:35] them but let it be a Salvation to
[2:22:39] them that they will correct whatever
[2:22:41] they have done
[2:22:43] wrong and you will let your Holy
