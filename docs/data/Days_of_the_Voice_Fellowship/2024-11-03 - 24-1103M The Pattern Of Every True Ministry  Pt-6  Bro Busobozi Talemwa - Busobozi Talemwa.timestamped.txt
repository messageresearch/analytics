[1:32:41] testimony and we are so happy that you
[1:32:43] are able to come and greet us
[1:32:47] today and I hope you um sister py used
[1:32:51] to be one of the uh uh leaders for the
[1:32:55] uh land fund team
[1:33:01] groups I hope you handed over properly
[1:33:03] to someone
[1:33:06] else but that does not mean you hand
[1:33:08] over
[1:33:12] giving as a matter of fact now that you
[1:33:14] are married to brother
[1:33:16] Al you should be uh more able to now uh
[1:33:21] be an ambassador for us
[1:33:26] and and and tell him about the vision of
[1:33:28] the church where you are
[1:33:30] from what we are doing and perhaps he
[1:33:33] can join
[1:33:35] you and and supporting
[1:33:37] us and together with the entire spe
[1:33:40] family where you
[1:33:42] now you know I was telling
[1:33:46] someone uh a
[1:33:48] man leaves his father and
[1:33:52] mother not the woman read your Bible
[1:33:58] very so you see the man who marries the
[1:34:03] woman he becomes the new father the one
[1:34:06] with
[1:34:09] responsibility but the old father is not
[1:34:14] dead he only has responsibility as
[1:34:19] shifted so I no longer have spiritual
[1:34:21] responsibility over sister PE
[1:34:27] but brother Alex you
[1:34:29] do you are accountable before
[1:34:33] godet tells us that of course along with
[1:34:36] your
[1:34:37] pastor but you see you are still our
[1:34:41] child sister
[1:34:42] peace and you need to
[1:34:45] participate in in the growth of your
[1:34:47] home as a matter of fact when young
[1:34:51] ladies get married
[1:34:54] always warm up and for things
[1:34:57] coming so we want the things to come do
[1:35:00] you all agree with
[1:35:03] me we want to see the fruits amen am but
[1:35:07] certainly we were so
[1:35:09] happy to have you marry your brother
[1:35:13] Alex join our sister
[1:35:18] church we respect
[1:35:22] them and I we know that you're well
[1:35:24] taken care
[1:35:27] of that is how it has to
[1:35:29] be when a woman
[1:35:32] marries she follows her
[1:35:34] husband tell your
[1:35:36] neighbor when a woman gets
[1:35:38] married she follows her
[1:35:41] husband that's what we

[1:48:09] [Music]

[1:48:20] speaking on the pattern for every true
[1:48:22] meaning
[1:48:27] so if you are here for your first
[1:48:30] time please feel at
[1:48:32] home
[1:48:34] relax we are uh we are called days of
[1:48:37] the voice
[1:48:38] Fellowship of The Voice or
[1:48:41] DF we have no book but the
[1:48:44] Bible we have no
[1:48:47] law but
[1:48:49] love we have no membership
[1:48:53] but
[1:48:54] Fellowship we have no
[1:48:57] Creed but
[1:49:00] Christ and we believe the blood of Jesus
[1:49:03] Christ wases us from all
[1:49:06] sin so everyone is
[1:49:08] welcome here is where we just study the
[1:49:11] word preach the word and we do not have
[1:49:15] any kind of
[1:49:19] denominational we don't have a
[1:49:21] denomination
[1:49:22] we are just Bible
[1:49:24] lovers and we are just
[1:49:26] Christians amen so tell your neighbor
[1:49:29] feel at
[1:49:31] home amen relax in the presence of the
[1:49:34] holy spirit this morning so um this
[1:49:38] morning this
[1:49:40] our subject is going to be divided or
[1:49:43] subdivided into two three
[1:49:47] parts so so that you can know where I we
[1:49:50] are
[1:49:51] headed and able to follow
[1:49:54] through so first we'll be speaking a
[1:49:57] little bit about the false anointed
[1:50:01] ones that is from vers
[1:50:04] 23 to uh about vers uh
[1:50:10] 24 where he speaks of the the the
[1:50:14] Christ and the many false Christ that
[1:50:16] shall
[1:50:17] arise and the false prophets which will
[1:50:21] s or show Great Signs
[1:50:25] that if it is
[1:50:27] possible they would even have deceived
[1:50:28] the
[1:50:29] elect but before we even
[1:50:32] continue the elect cannot be
[1:50:36] deceived because the Bible says here if
[1:50:39] it were
[1:50:41] possible and that the word if there
[1:50:45] shows that it is
[1:50:46] impossible to deceive
[1:50:49] the and then the second part will speak
[1:50:51] about the coming of the son of
[1:50:55] man and then the third part we will talk
[1:50:57] about wheresoever the carcass is
[1:51:01] body and what that
[1:51:03] signifies to us because we are the
[1:51:06] eaget that gather around the
[1:51:09] body the body word of the son of
[1:51:15] man so these are some of um some kind of
[1:51:18] deep scriptural things and terms
[1:51:23] but I want you to open your
[1:51:26] heart and so I'm going to begin quoting
[1:51:29] a certain quote in 1965 by William
[1:51:34] Bram from the message
[1:51:37] leadership and he said false
[1:51:40] prophets the Bible said in the last
[1:51:42] days there would be false
[1:51:45] prophets now Jesus said there shall
[1:51:48] arise false christs
[1:51:53] and he says not false
[1:51:57] Jesus's now nobody stands for
[1:52:00] that no nobody stand still for
[1:52:03] that but false
[1:52:06] Christ I mean here in um in in
[1:52:10] Uganda we have had some men who have
[1:52:13] come
[1:52:14] up and they said I am
[1:52:16] Jesus how many saw those
[1:52:19] videos and someone asked are you sure
[1:52:22] are you the real real one yes I am the
[1:52:25] real
[1:52:26] one I mean you just see the
[1:52:28] delusion the spirit of
[1:52:31] delusion I mean even the denominational
[1:52:33] people can't believe
[1:52:35] that they just look at someone who is
[1:52:37] czy so brother bam says here nobody
[1:52:41] stands still for that kind
[1:52:45] of false
[1:52:47] Jesus of someone else calling himself
[1:52:51] Jesus so the Bible is not saying there
[1:52:54] shall be false
[1:52:57] jesuses but is saying there shall be
[1:53:00] false
[1:53:02] Christ because Christ as we shall see
[1:53:05] means the anointed
[1:53:09] one they are anointed with the right
[1:53:13] anointing but they are
[1:53:16] false they can do signs and
[1:53:18] wonders they can do Miracles they can
[1:53:21] raise the Dead
[1:53:23] they can speak in tongues they can do
[1:53:25] miraculous things Open the Eyes of the
[1:53:27] blind the lamb can walk but the people
[1:53:31] who have that
[1:53:33] anointing are F that's what Jesus is
[1:53:36] saying here that in the end time there
[1:53:39] shall arise first
[1:53:42] Christ are you with me this
[1:53:44] morning Christ means the anointed
[1:53:49] ones tell your neighbor of Christ means
[1:53:51] the anointed on
[1:53:55] amen falely
[1:54:00] anointed falsely
[1:54:04] anointed they are
[1:54:06] anointed but they are false at the
[1:54:10] bottom of
[1:54:14] it are you following me
[1:54:16] now they will do great signs and
[1:54:21] wonders speak in times they will dance
[1:54:24] in the spirit they will preach the
[1:54:27] gospel the anointing is good we need it
[1:54:32] let me tell you I don't need to be in a
[1:54:34] church or under a Ministry which has no
[1:54:39] anointing I want to be under a
[1:54:42] Ministry or under a church that has
[1:54:47] anointing because we need it it is good
[1:54:52] but let us never Focus only on
[1:54:57] that this is not the right
[1:55:00] way for determining the false and the
[1:55:03] true
[1:55:06] Christ in our generation everyone is
[1:55:09] looking for
[1:55:11] anointing where is the anointed one
[1:55:14] where is the prophet where is the
[1:55:16] Apostle where is the man of God oh
[1:55:19] prophesy
[1:55:20] Papa where there are those things the
[1:55:22] people will
[1:55:24] go because they are looking for
[1:55:27] numbers but we are not looking for
[1:55:30] numbers we are looking for the Bride of
[1:55:33] Jesus Christ we are looking for the one
[1:55:37] that is interested in the seed of the
[1:55:40] world praise the name of the Lord so
[1:55:43] they will go and he say he gives you
[1:55:46] examples here he says Judas esar did
[1:55:50] it now has
[1:55:53] prophesied you know bam the
[1:55:57] hypocrite done all the signs every all
[1:56:00] the religious
[1:56:02] moves I want you to
[1:56:05] imagine a man let us just have a
[1:56:08] moment and rehear a little
[1:56:10] bit do you know the Bible says that
[1:56:13] Judas was the Devil
[1:56:18] Himself in John 67
[1:56:23] 71 Jesus spoke and he said I call you
[1:56:28] 12 and one of you
[1:56:33] devil brother Alan I want to
[1:56:38] imagine Judas was a
[1:56:42] devil was he
[1:56:45] called answer
[1:56:47] me was he called
[1:56:52] called right now follow me don't lose
[1:56:56] it was it
[1:56:59] called okay was he
[1:57:02] anointed if you doubt go to Matthew
[1:57:06] 10 and I can read it
[1:57:09] right Matthew 10 there are many
[1:57:12] scriptures I wanted to read
[1:57:14] today but as usual when I feel the
[1:57:16] spirit is done I get
[1:57:18] finished and when he had called unto him
[1:57:20] his 12 disciples
[1:57:23] this is Jesus he gave them
[1:57:27] power against unlean
[1:57:29] spirits to cast them
[1:57:32] out and to heal all manner of
[1:57:34] sickness and all manner of
[1:57:38] disease Hallelujah now the names of the
[1:57:40] 12 apostles are
[1:57:43] these
[1:57:45] Simon who is called Peter Andrew his
[1:57:49] brother James the son of Ze
[1:57:52] his brother Philip bolom Thomas Matthew
[1:57:57] the Publican James the son of
[1:58:01] alas
[1:58:04] whose ver four Simon the
[1:58:07] canite can you now read with me and
[1:58:11] Judas
[1:58:14] isar who also betrayed
[1:58:18] him Judas was among the 12
[1:58:22] that were given
[1:58:24] power were given
[1:58:26] anointing to cast out demons to heal the
[1:58:29] sick all man of sickness they they were
[1:58:33] given the
[1:58:34] anointing this man was
[1:58:36] called this man had anointing so what
[1:58:40] are you talking
[1:58:41] about he was called he had anointing but
[1:58:45] he was a false
[1:58:47] preacher he was a Devil
[1:58:50] Himself and the only thing that made him
[1:58:53] be
[1:58:54] that is because he denied
[1:58:58] Jesus who is Jesus Jesus is the revealed
[1:59:05] word but because he denied the
[1:59:09] word he was a false
[1:59:12] pre but
[1:59:14] Anointed with the right Spirit called by
[1:59:19] God doesn't the Bible say many are
[1:59:23] called come on but few are
[1:59:28] chosen I ask you a question this morning
[1:59:31] are you
[1:59:33] chosen are you
[1:59:35] chosen don't be D on me now are you
[1:59:39] chosen if you are chosen you are chosen
[1:59:42] for what you are chosen to believe
[1:59:46] everywhere that comes out of the mouth
[1:59:49] of
[1:59:50] God Judas was a devil
[1:59:52] himself think about
[1:59:55] cfas kaas
[1:59:57] prophesied but yet is the one who
[1:59:59] crucified
[2:00:01] Jesus he gave him
[2:00:03] up balam you remember how balam the
[2:00:07] Bible say the spirit of
[2:00:09] God Came Upon Bal and spoke
[2:00:14] to talk about anointed
[2:00:18] people was
[2:00:20] anointed to the extent
[2:00:23] that a man a
[2:00:25] king would give him a lot of
[2:00:28] money a lot of clothes and promises for
[2:00:32] power if only he can help him to go and
[2:00:39] cast the
[2:00:41] Israelites now you can you can tell me
[2:00:45] maybe was not a true Prophet because he
[2:00:48] was not you know hearing from God I said
[2:00:52] no bam was actually hearing from
[2:00:57] God God spoke to
[2:01:00] him he would come and say God spoke to
[2:01:04] me and God told me not to cast
[2:01:07] them but you know when he goes back
[2:01:09] again because of the money because of
[2:01:12] the power because of of all these
[2:01:14] promises of the world he goes and he
[2:01:17] tries to bribe
[2:01:20] God because he was
[2:01:23] bried he thought God can be
[2:01:27] Bri false preachers will always be

[2:02:22] perish go with your money how many will
[2:02:25] do

[2:03:00] preacher he preaches what people want to
[2:03:03] hear he teaches what people are
[2:03:06] interested
[2:03:07] in but he knows what the Bible
[2:03:10] says but if he preaches what the Bible
[2:03:13] says the people will walk away from
[2:03:16] him that is a false
[2:03:19] Ministry that a true Ministry will stay
[2:03:22] with the
[2:03:24] word a true ministry will stay with the
[2:03:27] word at night during their time whether
[2:03:31] they have money or whether they are poor
[2:03:34] but I tell you brother a true ministry
[2:03:37] will stay with the
[2:03:40] word hallelujah amen I don't say the
[2:03:43] first Minister doesn't hear from
[2:03:47] God God is so generous with his
[2:03:49] anointing
[2:03:54] are you following me this morning God is
[2:03:56] very
[2:03:57] generous with his anointing you remember
[2:04:02] right in the Book of
[2:04:03] Esther there was many
[2:04:06] girls that were coming to the king and
[2:04:10] each girl as long as she came in the
[2:04:13] presence of the
[2:04:15] king she was given
[2:04:17] gifts and the King didn't like her so
[2:04:21] they took her to another
[2:04:22] house she would stay there and she would
[2:04:26] be
[2:04:27] spoiled with
[2:04:29] gifts
[2:04:31] they they are they they whatever she
[2:04:37] want but there was one woman and her
[2:04:40] name was es for her when they asked her
[2:04:45] what else do you
[2:04:46] need she said I want nothing
[2:04:50] else nothing more
[2:04:52] nothing less I only want to see the
[2:04:57] King give me the king oh give me nothing
[2:05:03] else became the
[2:05:05] bride had everything the king
[2:05:08] had es had access to the
[2:05:11] throne until the king one day he said to
[2:05:15] eser eser I will give you everything you
[2:05:19] need even to half of my
[2:05:23] I will rule with you just say what you
[2:05:26] want because es chose the
[2:05:29] King instead of the blessings and the
[2:05:32] gifts of the
[2:05:34] king we love gifts we love anointing
[2:05:39] that's good but brother when you believe
[2:05:42] the word the gifts will come when you
[2:05:45] believe the world the signs and wonders
[2:05:48] will
[2:05:48] come the true bride of Jesus Christ
[2:05:52] is not going to follow signs and wonders
[2:05:55] the true of Christ will follow the word
[2:05:58] and the signs and the Wonders will
[2:06:01] follow the
[2:06:03] bride and these signs shall follow
[2:06:08] them Mark 16 these signs
[2:06:13] shall
[2:06:15] follow not go before them praise the
[2:06:19] name of the Lord when you first start
[2:06:21] out
[2:06:22] you may not see any sign and
[2:06:24] wonder you know the first miracle I saw
[2:06:27] in my
[2:06:28] life
[2:06:30] myself I was the first
[2:06:33] miracle when I believed the devil
[2:06:35] thought he had worn over my life but
[2:06:38] when I believed and I was changed and I
[2:06:41] overcame the world and I was filled with
[2:06:44] the Holy Spirit I was the first
[2:06:48] sign to the devil the first Wonder
[2:06:52] to the devil the first
[2:06:54] Stander to the devil to prove the devil
[2:06:57] God has power I was the first
[2:07:01] miracle that I saw in my life and since
[2:07:05] then I have seen many more
[2:07:08] miral I've seen them following I've seen
[2:07:12] the sick healed I've seen the dead raed
[2:07:16] Hallelujah I have seen the sick heer
[2:07:20] what are you talking about I am saying
[2:07:22] signs and wonders will
[2:07:24] follow But first you have to follow the
[2:07:29] word you see balam was a
[2:07:33] hypocrite he had the anointing through
[2:07:37] anointing and yet he was a false
[2:07:41] preacher and we have many of those in
[2:07:43] our
[2:07:44] generation but you see you put a CA seed
[2:08:01] you put a
[2:08:03] seed it's the thing that sticks when you
[2:08:05] walk in the
[2:08:08] forest that kind of plant so if you take
[2:08:11] the seed of that
[2:08:12] plant and you also take the wheat
[2:08:16] seed and in the same
[2:08:19] bed and you power water down
[2:08:23] and anoint
[2:08:25] them they will both
[2:08:29] Rejoice they will both grow by
[2:08:32] it the same
[2:08:34] water the same Sun Shines on the just
[2:08:37] and on the
[2:08:40] unjust and the rain folds on the just
[2:08:42] and the
[2:08:44] unjust by their
[2:08:47] fruits oh my good Lord you shall know
[2:08:51] that
[2:08:52] you cannot know is it weed wheat is it
[2:08:58] cocar when it is still young that's why
[2:09:01] Jesus said don't uproot
[2:09:04] it you know the seeds of the bad
[2:09:09] s don't uproot it wait until the time of
[2:09:14] the
[2:09:16] Harvest when is the Harvest Time the
[2:09:19] Harvest time is the end time
[2:09:23] the end of the Gentile
[2:09:26] [Music]
[2:09:28] dispensation on Sunday we looked at the
[2:09:30] seven Church
[2:09:32] ages you know seven
[2:09:34] churches you know someone was asking me
[2:09:37] what does it
[2:09:38] mean was still confused if you're one of
[2:09:41] us Revelation
[2:09:44] 1:3 speak about seven
[2:09:47] churches and he he says these are seven
[2:09:50] churches in Asia
[2:09:53] and he mentions their
[2:09:55] name mentions
[2:09:57] Ephesus
[2:09:58] mentions
[2:10:00] mention mention s
[2:10:04] phia and all these seven
[2:10:07] churches they were in Asia now remember
[2:10:10] it was physically there these were
[2:10:12] cities physically
[2:10:15] there in Asia Minor here present
[2:10:19] tury those churches were there
[2:10:22] physic but God used
[2:10:24] it it wasn't meaning only those physical
[2:10:29] churches he said to John in the vision
[2:10:33] these things which are revealed to you
[2:10:35] are the things which are and which shall
[2:10:39] be here
[2:10:41] after so it was prophetic
[2:10:44] churches it was speaking about the
[2:10:47] future Church ages
[2:10:51] let me put it this way you were speaking
[2:10:53] about the
[2:10:55] ages of the future
[2:10:58] Church of Jesus
[2:11:01] Christ from the time of the
[2:11:04] Apostles to the end of
[2:11:07] time and when I say the end of time you
[2:11:10] still have that picture of the church
[2:11:12] and when I say the end of
[2:11:14] time I mean the end of the gentle
[2:11:18] churches
[2:11:21] the Rapture of the
[2:11:23] Bride I mean the
[2:11:26] time when amen the tribulation will
[2:11:30] begin because when the Rapture
[2:11:33] happens the tribulation
[2:11:36] begins God Lives the
[2:11:38] Gentiles and he goes to the
[2:11:41] Jews but I am so glad I am not hated for
[2:11:45] the
[2:11:46] tribulation I am so glad I am thinking
[2:11:50] and waiting on the rapture
[2:11:53] I am waiting on the coming of the
[2:11:55] Lord the Gentile Church
[2:11:59] ages have now
[2:12:01] finished where are we in God's
[2:12:06] timeline we are right there at
[2:12:09] L we are in the last
[2:12:12] Church the Bible says
[2:12:14] L is a church which is
[2:12:17] lukew it is not cold not hot
[2:12:21] it is in the
[2:12:22] middle Believers of our
[2:12:25] generation are in the middle they are
[2:12:28] not called they are not they are not
[2:12:31] true believers they are not false
[2:12:35] believers they in the midle but what did
[2:12:38] Jesus say because you are not cold and
[2:12:42] you are not I will spew out of
[2:12:46] my I'll SP the out of my mouth
[2:12:51] because I want you to be either cold or
[2:12:56] to be

[2:13:04] hot hallelujah amen we
[2:13:09] are hallelujah oh my am may God give us

[2:13:26] and red hot
[2:13:30] Christians you don't praise the name of
[2:13:32] the Lord and so we notice we are right
[2:13:35] there at the end of the gender
[2:13:39] dispensation and the church is coming to
[2:13:41] a
[2:13:42] close and God is just collecting the
[2:13:47] wheat amen by the last Angel's message

[2:14:21] was in the ministry of
[2:14:24] elishah then the third time he came was
[2:14:27] in the ministry of John
[2:14:31] the then the fourth time he comes is to
[2:14:35] the Gentile
[2:14:39] church that's the fourth time he
[2:14:42] comes that last age
[2:14:45] messenger there seven stars but the last
[2:14:50] star be the Elijah to our
[2:14:53] time according to Malachi
[2:14:57] 45-6 and many other scriptures and so
[2:15:00] that Elijah when he
[2:15:02] comes amen then we see there will be
[2:15:05] another one who will

[2:20:01] genuine you don't have to do
[2:20:06] that you know they even teach people how
[2:20:09] to speak
[2:20:11] tongues that is the
[2:20:14] fults when you believe the true
[2:20:17] gospel the Bible say
[2:20:21] the son shall follow them and they shall
[2:20:24] speak in new
[2:20:26] tongues it's a gift from God you don't

[2:22:23] chamber who is in a desert who is in a
[2:22:27] Prayer Mountain somewhere no our message

[2:22:53] secret
[2:22:54] chamb but don't go but you know he
[2:22:58] continues on and it tells us where
[2:23:01] Christ
[2:23:02] is praise the name of the Lord if you
[2:23:06] have been
[2:23:07] following let me go ahead of myself a
[2:23:09] little bit on vers 28 he says whatsoever
[2:23:14] the body
[2:23:16] is the
[2:23:18] word whereever
[2:23:21] word whever the
[2:23:24] word is that is where the Eagles are
[2:23:28] gathered
[2:23:30] together where will the bride
[2:23:33] go oh my I don't know whether you
[2:23:36] understanding what I'm talking about we
[2:23:38] are not going in a desert because it's a
[2:23:41] Holy Mountain because it's a holy desert
[2:23:44] because secret chamber you know the
[2:23:46] Muslims go in in Mecca they holy
[2:23:51] place the Catholics go
[2:23:54] wrong kiss the holy
[2:23:57] man a great anointed
[2:24:00] man and others go to several other
[2:24:03] places you know some Pentecostals they
[2:24:06] know of some sacred holy
[2:24:09] mountains where they go to meet God and
[2:24:13] I'm not saying going to a lonely place
[2:24:15] to pray is
[2:24:17] bad that's okay speaking about the
[2:24:21] religious
[2:24:22] spirit of people thinking when I go to
[2:24:24] this
[2:24:26] place then I will find God I'm bringing
[2:24:29] it to your understanding that God is in
[2:24:33] one place the
[2:24:36] word the
[2:24:39] word brother asked a question where
[2:24:43] shall We
[2:24:44] Gather where is the rapture going to
[2:24:46] take place will it be in
[2:24:48] Arizona or will it be in
[2:24:51] Jefferson where should we go should we
[2:24:54] call all the
[2:24:55] people and tell them to come to days of
[2:24:58] the voice
[2:25:00] fellow is this the
[2:25:02] boat like that of Noah should we tell
[2:25:05] them to come to our
[2:25:08] headquarters and I'm sorry we have no
[2:25:11] headquarters where shall they gather
[2:25:14] there is only one place where people can
[2:25:17] gather and be sure they will be in the
[2:25:20] rapture
[2:25:22] and that place is in the
[2:25:24] word in the word of God as long as you
[2:25:28] are buried in the
[2:25:30] world then you will be in the
[2:25:33] resurrection hallelujah amen that is our
[2:25:39] above this is our
[2:25:41] above when you believe the word you will
[2:25:45] receive the
[2:25:46] spirit and you'll be born again
[2:25:50] surely you will overcome the
[2:25:54] work the problem why people don't get
[2:25:57] born
[2:25:58] again they don't get changed they reject
[2:26:01] the
[2:26:03] word when you hear the word which is the
[2:26:06] solution to your
[2:26:07] problem you don't believe
[2:26:10] it you you come and ask me Pastor how
[2:26:13] can I overcome this I am failing and I
[2:26:17] tell you go in prayer and
[2:26:18] F and ask fill with the Holy Spirit and
[2:26:22] you refuse to do it you remain the
[2:26:26] same but you see if you did what the
[2:26:29] word told
[2:26:30] you you will be
[2:26:32] changed but people reject the
[2:26:35] word now I want you to look at the
[2:26:37] second part here of Matthew
[2:26:41] 2427 for as the lightning cometh out of
[2:26:44] the
[2:26:46] East and shineth even unto the
[2:26:49] West some sterio there so shall also the
[2:26:52] coming of the Sun
[2:26:54] be praise the name of the Lord I'd like
[2:26:57] us to look at this coming of the son of
[2:26:59] man in just a
[2:27:02] moment in Isaiah 30:
[2:27:06] 30 he says and the Lord shall cause his
[2:27:09] glorious voice to be
[2:27:12] heard and he will show the lightning
[2:27:15] down of his arm the liting down of his
[2:27:17] arm
[2:27:20] with the indignation of his
[2:27:22] anger and with the flame of a devouring
[2:27:24] [Music]
[2:27:27] fire with scattering and Tempest and
[2:27:32] hailstones
[2:27:34] now when you continue reading the
[2:27:37] Bible you will find that he speaks about
[2:27:40] two
[2:27:42] days of the Lord one was the great day
[2:27:45] of the Lord another was the Dreadful day
[2:27:48] of the Lord
[2:27:50] the great day of the Lord is when he
[2:27:52] came to die for us on the
[2:27:55] cross and in Isaiah chapter
[2:27:58] 61 he calls it the acceptable year of
[2:28:01] the
[2:28:02] Lord which is the Year of
[2:28:06] Jubilee now that that was fulfilled when
[2:28:10] Jesus came and died on the cross he
[2:28:14] declared the Year of
[2:28:16] Jubilee the year of Freedom the year of
[2:28:19] healing
[2:28:21] it was a wonderful day and there is
[2:28:23] another day
[2:28:24] coming give me the song was says a great
[2:28:27] day coming a great
[2:28:29] day that Dreadful
[2:28:31] day which is coming is going to be a sad
[2:28:35] day he's talking about hail
[2:28:39] Stones indignation of the anger of the
[2:28:42] Lord the flaming
[2:28:45] fire and you know did you get a song yes
[2:28:49] I wanted to some someone said there's a
[2:28:51] great day coming a great day coming
[2:28:53] there's a great day coming by and by
[2:28:56] when the siners when the Saints and the
[2:28:58] Sinners shall be parted right and left
[2:29:01] are you ready for the day to come give

[2:29:21] bright day coming by and by but it
[2:29:25] brightness shall only come to them that
[2:29:27] love the
[2:29:29] Lord are you ready for the day to come
[2:29:33] give me the next next Stan there's a sad
[2:29:35] day coming a sad day coming there's a

[2:29:41] by when the Sina shall

[2:29:49] the day to
[2:29:51] come now that day is coming it's going
[2:29:54] to be a sad day theer of the Lord the
[2:29:58] indignation of the Lord fire and
[2:30:01] fury but he says before that day
[2:30:05] comes there is going to be a glorious
[2:30:10] voice the Glorious voice of the
[2:30:13] Lord hallelujah how many have heard his
[2:30:16] voice in our
[2:30:18] generation he has spoken to
[2:30:21] us oh hallelujah hallelujah the lion has
[2:30:27] Ro the lion has
[2:30:29] Ro who is the lion the lion of the tribe
[2:30:33] of
[2:30:35] Judah his name is Jesus and he has roed
[2:30:39] in our
[2:30:40] generation through his
[2:30:43] messenger and he has given to us the
[2:30:46] message of restoration
[2:30:50] us back
[2:30:51] again to the principles of the
[2:30:55] word to the teachings of the
[2:30:57] Apostles I said the lion
[2:31:00] has who shall but
[2:31:03] prophesy praise the name of the Lord and
[2:31:06] we see the Bible also in the Book of
[2:31:10] Malachi chapter chapter one chapter five
[2:31:14] rather he he says these words chapter
[2:31:18] four excuse me verse one he says for
[2:31:23] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[2:31:27] an

[2:41:42] what is written in the scriptures but
[2:41:44] not everything is
[2:41:45] written so we don't know what will be
[2:41:48] there we also don't know what everything
[2:41:50] will be in
[2:41:51] heaven all I want is I want to be
[2:41:54] there and I know Heaven is not a story I

[2:42:07] I want to be on fire for my
[2:42:09] God because I want to be
[2:42:13] there praise the name of the Lord now
[2:42:16] Luke chapter 17 talks about the son of
[2:42:20] man being
[2:42:22] revealed this is a very special
[2:42:24] scripture I want you to please pay
[2:42:27] attention vers
[2:42:30] 26 and as it was in the days of
[2:42:33] Noah so shall it be also in the days of
[2:42:37] the son of
[2:42:38] man you know we began in Matthew
[2:42:41] 24 where it speaks about the coming of
[2:42:43] the son of man and now here in Luke
[2:42:47] listen he's explaining
[2:42:50] how the coming of the son of man will
[2:42:54] be now remember here is the interesting
[2:42:59] part Jesus he is the son of man when he
[2:43:03] is on Earth as a
[2:43:07] prophet are you following
[2:43:10] me but right now he's a Son of God that
[2:43:14] is the
[2:43:15] dispensation he's operating in for the
[2:43:19] record let me just rehearse this a
[2:43:20] little bit for
[2:43:22] you he he comes first as a son of
[2:43:29] man that
[2:43:31] happened if you can't write it down that
[2:43:34] happened from uh
[2:43:38] Bethlehem or from um then to
[2:43:42] Calvary his ministry on
[2:43:45] Earth that he was a son of man
[2:43:49] Prophet who ended up
[2:43:51] dying and then Jesus also comes as a
[2:43:57] Son of
[2:44:00] God now as a Son of
[2:44:03] God that is the not a prophetic
[2:44:06] Ministry it's the Holy Spirit
[2:44:11] Ministry it started on the day of
[2:44:15] Pentecost up to when
[2:44:17] [Music]
[2:44:19] up to the
[2:44:21] Rapture now he's also going to come
[2:44:25] again a son of
[2:44:28] David a son of David it is going to be
[2:44:31] in the millennial
[2:44:34] range we will be with him in the
[2:44:37] millenum and he will rule all through
[2:44:40] the white Throne
[2:44:43] judgment all through the
[2:44:45] tribulation son of David he has no mercy
[2:44:49] towards the Gentiles his heart is only
[2:44:51] with the
[2:44:52] Jews and with his bride but we see here
[2:44:56] the Bible is talking about as it was in
[2:44:58] the days of
[2:44:59] Noah so shall it be also in the days of
[2:45:01] the son of
[2:45:03] man they did
[2:45:06] itat I want you to be pay attention
[2:45:09] because there's something I want to
[2:45:10] bring to your understanding they did
[2:45:12] itat they drun they married wi they were
[2:45:15] given
[2:45:16] marriage amen until the that Noah
[2:45:19] entered into the
[2:45:21] Earth and the flood came and destroyed
[2:45:24] them all likewise also as it was in the
[2:45:29] days of
[2:45:30] lot they did eat they drank they br they
[2:45:32] s they
[2:45:33] planted they builded by the same day the
[2:45:38] lot went out of
[2:45:40] Sodom it rained
[2:45:43] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[2:45:46] destroyed them all
[2:45:49] now listen carefully even
[2:45:52] thus shall it
[2:45:55] be in the
[2:45:57] day listen carefully when the son of
[2:46:03] man is
[2:46:05] revealed now Church pay attention he's
[2:46:09] not talking about the coming of the son
[2:46:12] of
[2:46:14] man he's talking about the revelation of
[2:46:17] the son
[2:46:20] the son of man already came and his
[2:46:24] ministry ended on the
[2:46:26] cross but this is the prophecy he's
[2:46:30] saying the son of man
[2:46:33] ministry will be the son of man will be
[2:46:36] revealed
[2:46:40] again through a
[2:46:44] prophet if you got it say
[2:46:47] am okay listen
[2:46:50] the revelation of the Son of
[2:46:52] God how do we know that so and so is
[2:46:57] revealing the son of
[2:47:01] man through the
[2:47:04] sign of the
[2:47:06] Messiah because the sign of the the son
[2:47:08] of man is the
[2:47:11] Messiah you're following me the son of
[2:47:14] man is the
[2:47:15] Messiah so now when do we see the sign
[2:47:19] of the
[2:47:20] Messiah the first time we see the sign
[2:47:22] of the Messiah is when he was speaking
[2:47:25] to
[2:47:26] Peter he called your name is
[2:47:30] Peter Simon
[2:47:32] son he
[2:47:36] revealed and then Peter was a man and he
[2:47:40] followed Jesus all his life and another
[2:47:44] time he
[2:47:46] designed a man called
[2:47:51] Nath he told him when you were under a
[2:47:56] tree I saw
[2:47:58] you behold an Israelite a man with no
[2:48:03] gu how did he know be how did you know
[2:48:08] when saw that and he asked how did you
[2:48:12] know he said when you were still under
[2:48:14] the
[2:48:15] tree I saw you he wasn't there physic
[2:48:20] but he
[2:48:23] designed and he could tell everything
[2:48:27] about believe this is the
[2:48:32] Messiah every one that Jesus revealed to
[2:48:36] himself like
[2:48:38] that they did not ask anything
[2:48:42] else they believed he was the
[2:48:44] Messiah are you following me oh my God
[2:48:47] there's some Revelations here
[2:48:49] L listen carefully now that was among
[2:48:53] the
[2:48:55] Jews Jews but there was another group
[2:49:00] called The
[2:49:01] Samaritan and there's another group
[2:49:04] called the
[2:49:06] Gentiles who are the
[2:49:08] Gentiles we who are the Samaritans it is
[2:49:12] a group of mixture of Jews and Gentiles
[2:49:14] there
[2:49:19] so they considered like
[2:49:21] Gentiles but not real
[2:49:23] Gentiles now
[2:49:26] Jesus told all his 12
[2:49:29] disciples go and buy meat imagine
[2:49:32] telling 12 men to go and buy
[2:49:36] meat maybe a or two kilog of
[2:49:40] meat there was something Jesus was
[2:49:42] doing the Bible says he had to go
[2:49:46] through Samaria
[2:49:50] oh Hallelujah am he was going to go to
[2:49:53] Samaria to reveal
[2:49:55] himself to someone there so when he
[2:49:59] reached all the men were away he Mets a
[2:50:03] woman that loves lovely story we
[2:50:06] know the woman at the
[2:50:08] well he begins talking to her he said
[2:50:11] give me to drink she then she begins
[2:50:13] saying for us we are Samaritans we don't
[2:50:16] give water we don't have any connection
[2:50:19] with the Jew Jesus said if you knew who
[2:50:23] was asking you give me to drink you
[2:50:26] would know the the can give
[2:50:30] you you will never thirst
[2:50:33] again she said give me to drink give me
[2:50:36] to drink oh someone should say this
[2:50:39] morning give me to drink there is more
[2:50:43] Revelation oh hallelujah amen and now
[2:50:47] Jesus continued
[2:50:49] he said go bring me your
[2:50:52] husband then she said I have no husband
[2:50:56] Jesus said you have spoken
[2:50:58] well
[2:51:00] because you have had five
[2:51:03] husband and the one you're
[2:51:05] living is also not
[2:51:10] yours the woman was shocked she had a
[2:51:14] water
[2:51:14] picture she threw it down and she ran
[2:51:18] the
[2:51:19] and she told everybody come listen to
[2:51:22] this words come see this
[2:51:26] man who has spoken everything about
[2:51:31] me and she said isn't
[2:51:37] this why did recognize
[2:51:40] him because he revealed the sign of the
[2:51:46] Messiah the Messianic sign
[2:51:50] amen the
[2:51:52] mic is a designment of the
[2:51:57] heart oh my God Church please don't miss
[2:52:01] this don't miss this the designment of
[2:52:05] the
[2:52:05] heart is different from the gift which
[2:52:08] the Bible calls the designment of
[2:52:12] spirits the designment of the heart is
[2:52:16] like the scripture which says the of God
[2:52:19] is sharper
[2:52:22] than it can cut through Soul and
[2:52:27] Spirit
[2:52:29] diving
[2:52:31] SHP it designs the heart everything
[2:52:35] about a
[2:52:37] person know the name of of a person you
[2:52:40] remember once one time the first time it
[2:52:42] happened was with
[2:52:45] Abraham and Sarah is someone following
[2:52:49] me when when M came that
[2:52:53] night he was with three two other
[2:52:56] angels and they were walking they were
[2:52:59] they had that
[2:53:01] Dusty and Abraham saw them Abraham had
[2:53:06] Revelation tell your neighbor Abraham
[2:53:08] had
[2:53:09] re Abraham did not say my
[2:53:13] lords Abraham saw him and it was
[2:53:16] revealed to him there something about
[2:53:19] this Hallelujah he said my
[2:53:23] Lord please come
[2:53:26] my and the says he gave
[2:53:29] him oh my godu who do weay
[2:53:34] to who to the Lord Abraham had
[2:53:39] Revelation that this was more than a
[2:53:42] man this is God revealed him revealing
[2:53:47] himself to me
[2:53:49] but people always miss
[2:53:52] it and some of you will miss it today
[2:53:55] but many of you will get it and don't
[2:53:57] miss it and so when the Messiah
[2:54:00] came WR to him at that
[2:54:03] moment he he spoke to
[2:54:06] Abraham he said according to the time of
[2:54:10] life next year your wife s shall be with
[2:54:16] child Sarah had that
[2:54:19] she was in the tent
[2:54:22] cooking and Abraham
[2:54:25] was and while she was cooking and she
[2:54:27] had that in her
[2:54:32] heart she laughed this man doesn't know
[2:54:35] how
[2:54:36] long in
[2:54:40] heart and said why did your
[2:54:44] wife and S said I did laugh
[2:54:50] because she had not
[2:54:52] laughed but she did in her but this one
[2:54:56] could be able to
[2:54:57] design what's in the heart of this
[2:55:01] one you get it is the same
[2:55:05] Jesus who came on Earth and spoke to
[2:55:09] Peter and also designed that
[2:55:12] woman of Samaria and the woman went and
[2:55:16] said come see a man who has spoken
[2:55:19] everything about
[2:55:20] me this the very
[2:55:23] Messiah and he said you
[2:55:26] know the Bible talks about the gift of
[2:55:30] of the discernment of
[2:55:32] spirits but sometimes that one can hit a
[2:55:39] Miss you've seen it happening among
[2:55:42] Min it can fail and it can happen
[2:55:46] sometimes but
[2:55:48] the one that Jesus
[2:55:50] had it was the
[2:55:53] word
[2:55:54] [Music]
[2:55:57] revealing it cannot fail because it is
[2:56:01] God it's the
[2:56:03] revelation of the son of
[2:56:06] man now among the
[2:56:10] Gentiles it had never
[2:56:14] happened until the
[2:56:16] ministry of a man called
[2:56:19] William William
[2:56:21] Bram listen
[2:56:24] carefully many
[2:56:26] preachers International preachers all
[2:56:29] over the world talk about
[2:56:31] William and his ministry has been going
[2:56:34] on for more than 50
[2:56:37] years since he died but there are people
[2:56:40] who follow his message all over the
[2:56:43] world
[2:56:45] but these
[2:56:47] people um uh who who don't believe in
[2:56:51] his
[2:56:52] ministry have been able from time to
[2:56:56] time they have said when brother Bram
[2:56:59] was
[2:57:03] Discerning this is how his meeting was
[2:57:06] done come line up all of you

[2:57:20] good now the people would line up they
[2:57:24] would give them prayer
[2:57:25] cards and they would line up and he
[2:57:28] would begin talking from one person to
[2:57:31] the
[2:57:32] other and he would
[2:57:34] say I I am your brother I am nobody I
[2:57:39] cannot help you but if he
[2:57:42] who the son of
[2:57:45] man Jesus Christ

[2:57:56] mouth and he will talk to let's see
[2:58:00] let's wait sincerely he would
[2:58:03] wait the things are on
[2:58:06] table and he would
[2:58:08] wait and then there would be a silence
[2:58:11] and then he would
[2:58:12] say he's here the Holy Spirit now I put
[2:58:17] every spirit in
[2:58:19] under my control for the glory of
[2:58:22] God and then he would say is this the
[2:58:26] patient I mean he would be in Two
[2:58:29] Worlds there is this physical world and
[2:58:32] he's also seeing spiritual
[2:58:34] things so he would is this
[2:58:37] the yes then he would look at the man
[2:58:40] and say your name is Brian Bri you come
[2:58:46] from he would mention the village you
[2:58:47] come
[2:58:49] he would mention the problem he would
[2:58:52] say I see you in the
[2:58:54] hospital the doctor you know yeah yeah
[2:58:58] it is this
[2:58:59] disease he would mention the
[2:59:01] disease and he would say if you believe
[2:59:04] with all you have go away from you and
[2:59:06] then you would say you are
[2:59:09] healed just like that and another person
[2:59:13] and another person and each of these
[2:59:16] people you can go back
[2:59:18] thank each of these people he would tell
[2:59:24] details sometimes in the
[2:59:27] congregation he would say it's not me
[2:59:29] I'm not reading their mind it is him
[2:59:32] he's here and then he would turn to the
[2:59:34] congregation and say over there your
[2:59:37] name is so and so stand up on your feet
[2:59:40] you've been praying that if that is God
[2:59:44] let talk about me stand up on your feet
[2:59:48] now thousands of
[2:59:52] times details and
[2:59:55] details it never failed even
[2:59:59] once not even one
[3:00:03] time said that Rob
[3:00:07] that that and many other preachers who
[3:00:11] were there physically they told you not
[3:00:14] once
[3:00:16] [Applause]
[3:00:18] not once they didn't ever
[3:00:21] fail they
[3:00:23] confirmed that it was not William Bram
[3:00:26] doing
[3:00:27] that it was Jesus Christ revealing
[3:00:31] himself to the
[3:00:33] Gentiles through a
[3:00:36] prophet to fulfill the
[3:00:40] prophecy that says even thus shall it be
[3:00:44] in the day when the son of man is
[3:00:46] revealed
[3:00:50] Jesus say the things I do shall you do
[3:00:54] also the things I do shall you do also
[3:00:58] because I go to the father now
[3:01:01] everything that was in the ministry of
[3:01:03] Jesus is supposed to repeat itself in
[3:01:06] the
[3:01:09] bride but we saw this scripture

[3:04:52] because it really moved
[3:04:54] me praise the name of the Lord let me
[3:04:57] just use another
[3:05:01] illustration he says have you ever
[3:05:03] noticed how the world gets into the
[3:05:06] spirits of things that are in the
[3:05:11] world they go to their ball
[3:05:15] games they are sporting even
[3:05:19] they
[3:05:20] daners they enter into the spirit of
[3:05:25] it you know if you a Believer and you go
[3:05:27] to a
[3:05:29] nightclub if you're true a Believer you
[3:05:31] will run
[3:05:33] out your spirit won't like
[3:05:37] it I will not ask you to raise up your
[3:05:39] hand but I would have asked you
[3:05:43] who and you tell me how you
[3:05:45] felt but I hope there is no one who was
[3:05:49] tried that is maybe if you have not yet
[3:05:52] believed maybe if you have not
[3:05:56] yet you know you go there I remember
[3:05:59] when I was still in
[3:06:01] school in high school you they have that
[3:06:05] party after
[3:06:08] exams when they about to do
[3:06:10] exams end of end of
[3:06:14] level so um they called for I don't know
[3:06:18] how they call it these days they call
[3:06:21] it so they they do party and they call
[3:06:24] everybody come and dance they tell you
[3:06:27] dress the way you
[3:06:29] want do whatever you want come and
[3:06:33] enjoy so people
[3:06:35] came day I was in
[3:06:38] Hostel I said to myself let me go and
[3:06:42] enjoy with
[3:06:44] them at least this once
[3:06:47] can know what
[3:06:49] happens so I was an Anglican
[3:06:53] then and um so I
[3:06:57] went and as I was
[3:07:03] entering the
[3:07:10] Sten just hit
[3:07:14] me I ran away as hard as I could
[3:07:19] I'm sure if anyone found me there they
[3:07:22] would have said you a
[3:07:25] s and you're
[3:07:27] quiet but I tell you
[3:07:29] friends that is we are not of the
[3:07:32] world we are not of the world that's the
[3:07:35] closest I've ever gone to a dance
[3:07:38] party and he says there sporting events
[3:07:41] and ball
[3:07:43] games you find them with their
[3:07:46] energy he saying but oh how they hate
[3:07:50] Christians you know for getting into the
[3:07:52] spirit of God is
[3:07:55] word when we dance when we are happy
[3:07:58] when we are shouting when we are
[3:08:00] clapping our hands they call us
[3:08:02] Fanatics they call us holy
[3:08:04] rollers there is nothing they want do to
[3:08:07] show their hatred and disapprove of
[3:08:12] us but I say ignore
[3:08:15] that you can expect it
[3:08:18] knowing knowing where it is coming from
[3:08:21] just go on and get in the spirit of
[3:08:25] worship Hallelujah am and he said our
[3:08:28] spirit is
[3:08:29] [Music]
[3:08:30] clean it is
[3:08:33] fresh it is
[3:08:35] real it is sober and
[3:08:38] serious full of the joy of the
[3:08:42] Lord hallelujah hallelujah the Christian
[3:08:45] ought to be just as exuberant as and
[3:08:48] full of his of of his uh pleasure in the
[3:08:51] Lord as the world is when it servers and
[3:08:54] delights in
[3:09:02] its both Christians and the world are
[3:09:07] human both have
[3:09:10] emotions the difference is the Christian
[3:09:13] is
[3:09:14] hearts and emotion
[3:09:17] purely on The Lord Of
[3:09:21] Glory and his
[3:09:23] love while the world satisfies the
[3:09:28] flesh I'm not going to go there and
[3:09:30] satisfy the flesh like they're
[3:09:33] doing let me tell you Church don't worry
[3:09:36] I'm not off my
[3:09:37] subject I'm talking about the pattern of
[3:09:40] the true every true
[3:09:42] minut if you are in the spirit you will
[3:09:46] always satisfy the spirit in
[3:09:49] you never feel shy to dance for the
[3:09:53] Lord if you're telling us for you you
[3:09:55] are
[3:09:57] emotionless you are
[3:09:59] lying it means your are emotion is
[3:10:02] touched by other
[3:10:05] things maybe you are one of those that
[3:10:07] go go to the
[3:10:10] CL and then you dance so when you come
[3:10:13] here you are
[3:10:14] ashamed maybe you go in those football
[3:10:16] games
[3:10:20] even remove their
[3:10:24] shs
[3:10:27] Mania but Brethren the spirit of Christ
[3:10:31] is
[3:10:31] another is a clean clear fresh
[3:10:36] Spirit when we are
[3:10:38] dancing for the Lord we are not ashamed
[3:10:40] of
[3:10:41] this am Oh
[3:10:45] Glory I said Glory
[3:10:48] we are not ashamed of
[3:10:50] shouting we are not ashamed of saying
[3:10:54] amen who
[3:10:56] cares only the devil and his
[3:10:59] people for us we are we are not ashamed
[3:11:02] of
[3:11:03] it why because we have our
[3:11:06] emotion on the things of
[3:11:09] God but when they said peace peace
[3:11:12] peace then sudden destruction shall come
[3:11:14] upon
[3:11:15] them like a travail of a woman with
