[1:41:42] must have a battle to
[1:41:43] fight say man he loves to be
[1:41:47] a and it is great when men
[1:41:51] conquer and conquer
[1:41:55] don't run
[1:41:56] away from their enemies they attack
[1:42:00] their
[1:42:01] enemies they attack their enemies they
[1:42:04] don't wait for the enemy to attack them
[1:42:08] if they know that's my enemy I do not
[1:42:12] care whether there is a peace between me
[1:42:15] and my enemy will attack the enemy and
[1:42:19] how comes How can there be peace between
[1:42:23] you and your enemy there is a peace
[1:42:26] between you and the
[1:42:28] devil he has conquered you he has
[1:42:31] conquered you but if he after you then
[1:42:35] you are
[1:42:37] conquering so they attack their
[1:42:40] enemy and break him
[1:42:44] down the Bible
[1:42:47] says that that
[1:42:50] Saul and the army of Israel
[1:42:54] they sat in the pmeg granite
[1:42:57] tree took a
[1:42:59] shade and the Philistines were over the
[1:43:02] other
[1:43:03] Sid they could not attack their
[1:43:06] enemies they were just so like
[1:43:11] defeated but there was
[1:43:13] one that was called
[1:43:16] Jonathan the son
[1:43:18] of he went beyond the
[1:43:24] going beyond the
[1:43:26] camp he did not care he didn't care what
[1:43:31] his father's mindset
[1:43:33] was concerning the battle he just made a
[1:43:37] decision a personal decision that I'll
[1:43:41] go out Beyond this
[1:43:44] Camp go to the camp of the enemy as one
[1:43:49] man as one man with this
[1:43:54] come let us go over the other side to
[1:43:58] the camp of the
[1:44:00] philes it may be that the Lord May
[1:44:04] deliver them into our hands he had
[1:44:10] 5050 faith and
[1:44:12] defeat but it may be that the faith was
[1:44:17] little I would go
[1:44:19] anyhow and he went to the camp of the
[1:44:22] enemy and reaching there the Bible says
[1:44:26] he asked a sign from the
[1:44:28] Lord he asked a sign from the
[1:44:31] Lord and the lord gave him
[1:44:34] a that when they shall call
[1:44:37] you and they say
[1:44:39] come he says I will go and reveal myself
[1:44:44] to my enemy I'm going to fight the enemy
[1:44:48] I'm not going to fight the
[1:44:51] enemy when I'm hiding
[1:44:53] I reveal myself to my enemy and he
[1:44:58] revealed
[1:44:59] himself I'm a
[1:45:02] be and when he revealed himself and they
[1:45:05] called them he said that is the sign God
[1:45:09] has delivered them into the hands of
[1:45:13] Israel his victory was not his only it
[1:45:18] was for Israel but he went as one man
[1:45:21] the victory not only yours for the
[1:45:24] Church of God your testimony is not only
[1:45:28] yours I can use your
[1:45:31] testimony to edify
[1:45:33] someone in the name of the Lord and the
[1:45:36] Bible says that Jonathan and his arm
[1:45:40] bear they fought the Battle and men and
[1:45:45] the Earth
[1:45:46] shook there was a great shaking and a
[1:45:50] great
[1:45:50] trembling it was not a great me it was
[1:45:54] one man taking God at his word it was
[1:45:59] one man a circumcised
[1:46:02] man that knew that as long as I'm
[1:46:06] circumcised the army of the
[1:46:09] uncircumcised cannot
[1:46:11] defeat the
[1:46:13] circumcised the Bible says after that
[1:46:17] Victory all all
[1:46:20] Israel they stood up where St was and
[1:46:25] the army they stood up and they said
[1:46:28] what's happening who has going away from
[1:46:31] us and they saw it was
[1:46:33] Jonathan and they went they chased after
[1:46:37] the
[1:46:38] enemy someone had to
[1:46:41] conquer someone had to
[1:46:44] conquer the faith of the
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:49] church someone had to go
[1:46:53] Pastor to go that there be a church
[1:46:57] today someone has to go that the army of
[1:47:01] God may be
[1:47:04] encouraged for God to
[1:47:06] move someone has to take a step the
[1:47:10] Bible says the armies of the
[1:47:13] Philistines God came down God came down
[1:47:19] in a great way that the enemies
[1:47:23] to fight
[1:47:25] against oh my God confused the
[1:47:30] enemies to fight against
[1:47:32] themselves there was some children of
[1:47:35] Israel that had followed the
[1:47:37] pH they were fighting together with the
[1:47:40] Philistines but the Bible says after the
[1:47:43] victory of
[1:47:45] Jonathan they
[1:47:47] turned they turned around and started to
[1:47:50] fight the philis
[1:47:53] brothers and sisters today that have
[1:47:55] left the
[1:47:56] word
[1:47:58] backen defeated and now are serving the
[1:48:02] enemy but
[1:48:04] someday when they shall hear your
[1:48:07] testimony when they shall hear your
[1:48:09] testimony your Victory what the Lord has
[1:48:12] done for you and you are
[1:48:15] singing see what the Lord has done my
[1:48:19] hands have touched
[1:48:20] it my feet have felt it
[1:48:23] I have it they will turn around and he
[1:48:27] fight the devil and he come back to the
[1:48:30] church they
[1:48:33] enemy the Bible
[1:48:35] says that he defeated the
[1:48:39] enemy the enemies
[1:48:41] Camp God gave them
[1:48:43] Victory because
[1:48:45] somebody someone had a
[1:48:49] mindset of a real conqueror
[1:48:54] brother sister you have got to
[1:48:57] fight until you defeat your
[1:49:01] enemy that's the mindset of a
