tonight that you are in our midst Lord we bless you Lord in Jesus name we pray amen shall return to a Bible you read with me in the book of Hebrews chapter 12 and reading from verses one [Music] Hebrews chapter 12. but the joy light there Hebrews 12. one says weather for uh wherefore seeing seeing we also are compared about with so great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which not so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God blessed Jesus Christ we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read tonight Lord we pray we know that any man can turn the pages of the Bible but Jesus might desire that you come and give us the inspiration tonight speak to us people bless us Lord that by the end of the service Lord Jesus we go back testifying how you have blessed us in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated obviously it's I want I have something that I want us to share tonight praise be to God ah are you expecting to receive from the law tonight amen the prophet tells us the message expectation uh we always receive what we expect blessed with the name of the Lord yeah it's not easy always to Stand Here personally it always gives me hard time whenever I'm told that you're going to stand there's never been easy praise be to God sometimes you wonder what you're going to speak and I'm trusting the Lord because he knows by desires of our heart yeah we don't stand here because we are Champion or we are anybody but we are stand here because of the grace of God blessed with the name of the Lord and always you feel nervous to stand here but I'm trusting the Lord tonight by the hope of the Holy Spirit I believe in the few minutes we are going to spend here he will speak to us amen God has never gathered his children in vain each time he gathers us you always have something for us praise be to God and uh I believe I've ever shared about this I don't know uh but tonight I want us to share about forecast faith praise be to God the Bible says that without faith it is impossible to please God and all the armor of Christians they are invisible praise be to God and the only way we can activate it is by faith because if you look at the nine spiritual gifts all of them they are invisible praise be to God amen you cannot see love but you have love you cannot see Faith but you have faith amen you cannot see patience but you have patience you cannot see long suffering meekness gentleness godliness all those things they are invisible but it's by faith that we put those things in action blessed be the name of the Lord and where we have read here in Hebrews chapter 12 I know the scripture has been read for centuries and thousands of years amen he said that we are for sins that we are compassed about with so great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight amen and the sin which that easily so easily be set us amen seeing that we are surrounded wherever we are we are surrounded by great cloud of witness and always we have two kind of witnesses blessed with the name of the Lord those who made it and those who fail amen and they fail not because God failed them but it's because they failed themselves blessed in the name of the Lord so tonight I don't know what uh I don't know uh the kind of witness you are looking at but I want to look at the positive Witnesses those who married amen the Bible says for us to make it let us lay aside every weight amen he has a reason why he's mentioning this because we know the Bible tells us that what happened to our fathers in the wilderness it was for our examples lest we repeat the same mistake amen because when they disobeyed God and they mumbled against God the Bible says a thousand they were killed by serpent blessed be the name of the Lord what killed them it was unbelief praise the Lord and what's the sin sin is unbelief and here the Bible is telling us let us let aside every weight you know the sin is very heavy sin is very heavy but there is a possibility of laying it aside so it served you to decide whether you're going to part with sin or you are going to carry on with it but here the Bible tells us let us lay aside every weight and every sin that was easily beset us and we run and beset us and let us the reason asked why you are here and you're not at home the Bible says let us not let you only but let us run together amen let us run with Passions amen the race that is said before us brethren we have a race set before us we are not the first runners in this race amen they're the first Runners the second Runners but we count ourselves as the last Runners amen and we know in the game in athletic game we know that always the last the first Runners and the last Runners they are always the best Runners amen so we consider ourselves we count ourselves to be the best Runners but before we run in this race we are running you don't run with everything amen you have to part with some things to run in this race you must be focused Amen to run in this race blessed be the name of the Lord if we are not focused we cannot make it in this race but we need to fast be focused amen when Elijah met when Elisha met Elijah amen Elijah had to go back and kill the seven Bullocks he had and offered party to his people amen because he knew that when he carry on with those things there he will not be focused so he had to go back he told him because Elijah when he came to him he just came and tap on him and then he continued but this man went and killed the seven Bullock he had and made the farewell to his people blessed be the name of the Lord and then he came and followed the Lord all of us in Christian Life we have a center or a point of focus and what has kept you moving for all these years what has kept you in the world for all these years not because you don't have battles Brothers we have battles not because we are not tempted we are tempted every day every hour every second but why have it why have you not given up it is because you have a point of forecast you are focusing on something amen you are focusing on somebody blessed with the name of the Lord we are focusing on Jesus Jesus our point of focus but the Bible tells us let us lay aside every weight each one of us we know the things which just easily beset us each one of us we know our point of weaknesses you know that uh for me however strong I am I cannot bypass there blessed in the name of the Lord so the Bible says let us don't run alone amen I know when God called Abraham blessed with the name of the Lord he called him to walk alone with God praise the Lord but here the Bible says let us run amen we know we are called from different walks of life to come and follow Jesus and when we come as one bunch different members in one body of Christ the Bible says let us run Amen Let Us lay aside every weight and every sin Let Us easily beset us God has brought us more in store blessed with the name of the Lord each one of us will have to determine our heart I always plan say God let me not be a hindering block let not be a hindrance to the children of God says that when one of us misbehave amen we can constraint death among us our people praise the Lord but let each one of us determine our heart to live for Christ amen Let each one of us dig ourselves let us search our lives and remove every hindrance amen every stumbling block in our lives I don't want to reach there and God said because I I misbehaved that's why I hear the days of the First Progress blessed with the name of the Lord but it's my prayer I know Brethren I have battles each one of us we have battles we are fighting and we are going to find this battle until Jesus comes amen but one thing I want to assure you that the battle we are fighting the victory is on our side best way the Bible tells us whosoever comes to God Must Believe not May believe you must believe that he is of them who seeketh him diligently blessed be the name of the Lord and verses 3 says looking unto Jesus who is the author I love that Jesus is the author of your faith it's the one who started it amen before you knew it brother sister Jesus had already started it amen so we don't need to worry about tomorrow whether I'm going to stand for the next 10 years whether I'm going to stand tomorrow no matter what comes our way we shall stand because Jesus is the author and the spiritual of our faith amen we did not even know that we had bypassed our theophany to be born in this world but that God Amen the one who is the author of our faith he said the prophet in our generation who came and revealed us the Mysteries that you know what boys bypass your theophany you were in God before the foundation of the world blessed with the name of the Lord so we don't need to worry what we have to do let us focus on Jesus amen when he called us the rest will leave it for him to begin with none of us told him to call did you tell Jesus that you called me no sir like we had uh in a convention West where the minister say that one came to Jesus running master good master I want to follow you Jesus told him his half holes and birds have their nest but a son of man has even no place to lay his head and here he met Andrew and told him come and follow me and the man gave ex's do you know what I have to fast count but he said let the dead body they are dead so it is Jesus's business amen this business we are in it is God's business you must be only willing to work with God amen but the rest belongs to him I don't know how I will maneuver tomorrow God he knows blessed be the name of the Lord we don't live for our own but we live for God praise the Lord so he said let us lay aside every weight Amen Let us look unto Jesus do not look at your pastor do not look at your brother did I look at your husband but let us look unto Jesus amen he is the author blessed with the name of the Lord Jesus is the finisher Jesus is the author of our faith praise the Lord amen who for the joy that was set before him and you are the cross many times we sing to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like him but when time come for that part of trial we don't want to take the Peter cup praise the Lord we all know what blessings alone but brother sometime this package it has a bitter side also when they were eating the lamb they had to mix it with bitter herbs yes sir amen it was a bitter harp I don't know I will not eat the pizza house you have to mix it with a bitter herb praise the Lord so Jesus when he looked at the glory set before him amen he said that uh set before him and he was the cross despising the shame when we will focus on Jesus looking at the glory I sent before us amen we are going to endure the trouble we are going into we are going to endure our trials praise the Lord because we know that even sickness cannot destroy us and if it destroys us it is added an advantage because there is a glory set before us amen that's where our focus is praise the Lord we should not settle for less we should only set up for God healing us from flu or call for fever brother sister that is still more in store amen let us keep focusing and moving forward in Christ blessed with the name of the Lord how to reach point where the blessings of God will burst in our midst amen we are the gift of the Holy Ghost will sweep in our meetings praise the Lord amen only what we need is to focus in the world let us focus in Christ let us blessed every weight praise be to God sometimes we look at where we have failed God you see about God I even wonder whether I'm the bride that is the devil lying you praise be to God as long as you're in that body that body has never been saved yes sir and we know the battle is in the mind that is the battlefield so you must put that mind into subjection amen let the devil not deceive you because it's not that there was to work to tell you whether you're a child of God or not praise be to God because the devil knows his end he cannot be forgiven he knows where he came from praise the Lord but let us focus on Jesus let us listen every weight and every sin in First Peter chapter 5. verses 7 it says cast all your cares upon Him for he cares for you let us cast our cares upon the Lord let us cast our worries upon the Lord let us let us cast our insufficiency upon the Lord our God is sufficient it's Jehovah amen is our healer is our provider what we have to do let us look unto Jesus and cast our worries upon him praise the Lord it will help us carry our abundance blessed be the name of the Lord amen when Jesus looks at the glory said before you remember the prophet says that when Jesus was in The Garden of Gethsemane he had about to within himself praise the Lord things were tough he prayed he was praying against the will of God he was looking at all the pain that touch and the agony was going to go through I said father if it is possible if but he knew that it was impossible I say finally Lord let your will be done praise be to God and the Bible tells us that by faith when Moses when Moses gets old he refused to be called inside of Pharaoh's daughter he shows rather to suffer with a chain of Israel the reproach of Christ amen Moses was forecast he knew that all this glory in Egypt is just for a meantime but there is eternal blessing amen so he show us to suffer with the children of Israel will the church need tonight not another message not another preacher not a mighty preacher but the church need to focus amen because God has given us everything in our generation blessed be the name of the Lord amen in the message the marriage of the Lamb the prophet say that you see God could not push us through a little pipe and pull us out of the other end and then saying blessed is the overcomer praise be to God we must overcome something because there is a reward for Overcomers not for quitters Amen brother you must overcome that habit in your life you must overcome your fears sometimes you want to plan fast but you see but also's brother you must overcome amen he says God cannot push us push us under like in the pipe and then it goes the other side the part of olden days it used to be that man could men used to go for battles and they fight and come back with the victory and to attain rank in the Army you had to work for it blessed be the name of the Lord you have to fight a full battalion and destroy all of them then you are promoted to another rank but nowadays it is the opposite people fight maybe through phones praise be to God identify them getting ranks and ranks I'm not bringing products on the pulpit but I'm trying to bring out something when it comes to weak Christian there is no shortcut praise be to God if the reward is for overcome as you must overcome amen because the battle is for the Lord and the victory is yours it is God fighting your battles and you go with the victory blessed be the name of the Lord so we must focus on the Lord praise the Lord many time we are looking at the contrary wind if you read the book of Matthew where the Bible says that when Jesus Jesus was in the boat and he was asleep and then there was a wind praise be to God this will be forgot that they had Jesus in the boat amen so many times there is an ash where we come to church to be awakened and be reminded of our promises in the world praise me to God this man for God that Jesus was there and then demon Rose and then she wrote and they started crying Master we are perishing praise be to God Amen but if they had focused on Jesus and not looking at the contrary wind they would move forward praise the Lord but we thank God that even when we are throwing down praise be to God he still lend us a Hopping hand praise be to God amen he says that blessed is the blessed is he that overcometh you want nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you have called to make a decision for yourself blessed be the name of the Lord we have called to make a decision for ourselves tonight amen I have got a decision to create an atmosphere where I want to be do you know it is possible for us to create that atmosphere and walk with God Amen strong with God and he was not blessed with the name of the Lord if you read Genesis the Enoch has a story enough started with from day one you hear an enocha be good until time comes Samuel time reaches somewhere blessed with the name of the Lord when this man made up his mind to walk with God after the producing after doing ABCD blessed with the name of the Lord I believe after living the inheritance for the children after you were here maybe ashamed in his business praise be to God he knew that all these things are temporary amen and the Bible says enocha walked with God after doing that this man became focused he focused himself to God Amen and he walked with God the Bible says and he was no more it just worked as a friend maybe they went on chasing one another and nobody did not even know that maybe he was going home blessed be the name of the Lord maybe it's the offer that the other side was dancing amen and he started developing our thrilling he was walking with God and Anoka was not found bless him in the name of the Lord so let us Focus Amen Let Us forget about our past let us forget about the battles we are fighting many times we remove our eyes from the greatness of our God and we look at the magnitude of our problems blessed with the name of the Lord but our God is bigger than any problem it's bigger than any mountain he's stronger than any weapon blessed be the name of the Lord the name of the Lord is strong and mighty power where your writers run oh praise the Lord do you think right just go there just the Bible says righteous run they're running from something yes sir the table is after us from the time you were upon if it wasn't the angel of the Lord keeping you brother sister you will not be here tonight you know be that many years ago blessed with the name of the Lord I believe that is the same Angel if you look at the mystery of the mystery of birth amen that angel amen when you are stealing the chin of your father blessed be the name of the Lord it is that angel are you seeing well focused focus goes back even before we are born amen because the prophets say that the child of life moves in millions to go and fertilize an egg praise be to God but it's only one that make it blessed in the name of the Lord so that same Angel who guided your way back is the one who's even guiding you today so let us focus on the Lord blessed with the name of the Lord he says you have got to make a decision for yourself I have to make a decision for myself yes my wife I have to make decision for myself you have to make for yourself also blessed with the name of the Lord in doing that we show our faith and respect to God young people you have to make a decision for yourself you know the kind of person you want to be if you think reggae is the best thing then because of reggae decision is yours amen if you just want to speak a good Christian and sit there and just know you and shake your head like Professor it's up to you if you want to be on fire for God Amen they're seek the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord amen let us hold fast in Hebrews chapter 10 verses 23 you say the letters hold fast the profession of our faith amen remember we don't have our faith but it's the Faith of Christ he said let us hold fast the profession of our faith wavering for he is faithful that promised amen God is faithful he cannot fail us amen he started with us is the Alpha and the Omega it started with us he will take us to the end blessed be the name of the Lord that's why sometimes we don't need to worry how will things be of course as human beings many times you think about it you look at your children you look at this maybe they're stretching around you you look at the future but he never told us to look down to the Future blessed with the name of the Lord God never told you to look at the Future No Sir go to look unto me amen he told them look and live looking unto God blessed be the name of the Lord because he's the one who holds tomorrow he knew you before the foundation of the world amen James chapter 1 verses 60 says that for he that waveth is like a wave of the sea driven with the Wind and toasted faith is an anchor and Baba says that faith When Faith speaks everything shuts up amen faith is like the king of the jungle that when it roars the entire jungle will have silence when you're sick and Faith Shut and face shouts sickness really be silent amen faith is the anchor praise be to God and if we are to make it in this personal what has kept me till this year for all the years it is having faith in God we have no super money now made this life none of us is Superman but Jesus is our Superman amen Jesus is our everything we don't need to go to gym and get the six packs in our uh maybe stomach around our chest no sir but we have Jesus amen Jesus is our master the prophecy that Samson was just an ordinary man maybe it was like tiny as Tiny as me but what made that difference was the spirit of God upon him amen where that Holy Ghost came upon him oh yes Samson became problem to the philistine praise be to God that is the thing that broke the fellowship in Eden because he failed to keep focused of looking on God's word in the message Victory Day 630 421 you see and this happens even in our daily life when you're at school and you lose focus if they have taken you there to study then remove your focus from books you focus on boys you focus on girls you know what happened and here he says that what broke Fellowship in Eden it was because Eve lost Focus amen you were supposed to focus on the the word of God but she lost that Focus amen and that's how serpent managed focusing on uh of her looking on God's word she listened to reasoning of the enemy if she had just stayed right with God God said so that set us it God said so but she did not want to do that she changed the focus of her glasses amen that's why the Bible told us where I read in Hebrews chapter 12. let us look unto Jesus amen let our Focus be on Jesus 24 7. no matter what is the surrounding but let us focus in the Lord amen when he was sick Focus unto Jesus when you are depressed look unto Jesus amen he is the center of our focus is the game changer the it's the one who solves our problems amen in the message discernment of the spirit the prophet says that the Sun that spirit see whether it is of god see whether it acts like him and if somebody kicks up something against you and throw that upon your life when you know you are as innocent as you can be and you know that you have got the spirit of God don't try to separate yourself don't try to act mean toward them don't cast them just walk on knowing that God did not do that God did that to give you a test to see how you would take it praise the Lord we must focus our lives not what somebody else says but focus our lives to Christ and to his word when you're focused I'm telling you nobody can move you the reason that's why people are drifted they are trusted the two and the floor they are moving from pillar to parts from church to church it is because they are not forecast amen but when you're focus in the Lord Jesus means more than life to you you cannot leave the message church and you go to Catholicism is because I wonder the kind of glass you're wearing either you're wearing sunglasses in the night blessed with the name of the Lord but when you're focused no matter what happens around you sometimes things seems like they are not working out amen and they never make you think that maybe the message you believe is the problem one brother one time say that before I believe the message I was very okay but when I believe the message things stand by suck and so that was an alarm that he was leaving the message blessed with the name of the Lord and when we believe the message it doesn't mean that you're not going to make problems amen but when we are growing there are many things the challenges the things we meet along the way even when a tree is growing you'll find a tall Fuller tree they will tell that three is 50 years or 100 years old and everybody admires it but do you know what that tree went through so there are many things we encounter during our growth but that three no matter what happens as long as the sun is there amen it knows that it will continue growing as long as the Son of God is in our midst as long as Jesus Christ is moving in our midst no matter what happened to us brother sister we are moving on amen the program the progress man looks over seems to be little but friends something is happening within us blessed with the name of the Lord your brother may not see it your husband may not see it your wife may not see it but the devil knows it amen blessed with the name of the Lord sometimes you don't you may not need me to see it bless him with the name of the Lord but our Heir and our only person knows it praise the Lord what we need is to focus to have that focused faith faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God amen we cannot grow in faith when we don't hear the word when we don't read the word when we don't attend Fellowship when we don't pray and fast blessed with the name of the Lord but when we Implement all these things we are going to get focused amen when we know who we are there we are going to be focused we know that we are not of this world we are just passed away praise the Lord he said let us lay aside rather be a cloud of witnesses who made it job is one of them he was tried he went through hard time we were telling his wounds but he never gave up amen because job was focused and through whatever he went through he happened was the first man to see Resurrection was job blessed with the name of the Lord when God wanted a job to see Resurrection chips and chicken he met him he made him go through hard time he allowed the devil to try him but God knew that this man was focused in him his anger was in the Lord and God was so sure amen every time God drops dry on your way God is very sure and very certain that you are going to overcome that trial blessed with the name of the Lord by some time we look at it and come from our perception and see the magnitude of the trial but my brother my sister God knows very well what is doing amen Samuel says that what kind of man when you're going to build a house you don't first sit and do the calculation unless you build amen do you know that we are House of God we are God's Powerhouse amen he said you first to sit and make the calculation lest you peel and you fail on the when men laughed at you but God who called us God cannot just lose us like that the add-on cannot happen and the devil knows that amen the devil is very sure that God cannot lose us and the devil knows that whether he like it or not we are going to make it we are moving forward we are not moving backward every sermon comes our way it makes us better Christian than when we came in amen so let us just focus Let each one of us Focus amen you get a scripture and cling to it say God I must see this happening in my life the Bible tells us that we should desire spiritual gift praise the Lord say God I want to see love in my heart give me love amen give me peace in my heart blessed with the name of the Lord we must be focused we should learn to speak to ourselves if we're some some time table speaks to himself he encourages himself in my soul trust in the Lord my soul be of good courage praise the Lord those are men who were focused the Bible said they moved once they put on sheep's kins they moved in deserts they were not satisfied why because these men were forecast amen let us not be like Lord when he entered Sodom he rested but Abraham who was focused he said no no no no no praise be to God there is something much better than this praise the Lord in the message Luke he says that we must focus our lives not what somebody else says but we must focus our lives to Christ and he is the one and if we get our lives line with the word then the word and our life becomes the same then you and the world are focused together let us light ourselves with the word let us that's why the Bible said let us lay aside every weight why are you laying it aside because you want to get line with the world blessed with the name of the Lord lay aside every weakness lay aside every bitterness lay aside every jokes praise be to God and let us get in line with the word because the Bible tells us in Revelation that the word and the bride say come amen let us get light with the fat praise be to God amen looking unto Jesus the author and the finish of our faith now keep your eyes on this Church the devil is putting out this propaganda the devil just want you to do like if stop for a minute don't you pay any attention to him I always said that there was like a hooker when mutembe is cutting best and full of his merchandise and to tell to people there he will even follow you for one kilometer he will fully explaining each and everything how it works you see this light this one if you charge it it's a solar light when you put it on solar just for one day three months even if it rained for a week you you see that's what the devil does and that's the mistake if did blessed with the name of the Lord let us not listen to The Devil's lie how can you stay without a girlfriend hey you have a backache you need to get a woman who told you that is the devil with his merchandise fornication adultery craziness and all those witchcraft it's like these people who sell the traditional hubs one Hub like this in one bottle it shows over 100 diseases those are all the tactics of the devil brother Peter is a doctor but he finds the decisions they are mentioned even they have no connection with the other one but this one she will ask him cancer heart attack pressure diabetes aedes syphilis let us keep forecast amen that is what we need but never just want to stop a minute don't pay any attention keep your eyes on Christ you are is on the word and keep moving on yes sir let us keep moving on when your eyes is on that light you're not going to move like this no sir because the center of your focus is that light but when you're focusing on that light amen the Bible says the word of God is a lumber to our feet you don't need to look down look unto the light the light direct your path blessed me the name of the Lord let the devil not lie you he will not turn our Glory Jesus is guiding my feet I only have to look unto him blessed me the name of the Lord when Jesus came walking on the sea and the disciples were scared praise the Lord they said that the ghost is moving a ghost ghost but one man was scared but when he was starting to focus now say chill if it is you my lord beat me also to walk on water blessed be the name of the Lord and Jesus told him Peter you can make it because Jesus was catching Peter's attention he was cashing Peter's Focus amen and when Peter focused on Jesus he came out of the boat very straight unstable amen and he was walking on the water why because his eyes was focusing on Jesus but when Peter removed his eyes from Jesus and he started mining on where he's stepping on he started to sink but that God reaching Mass he still gave him a Hopping hand blessed be the name of the Lord so let us focus on the Lord amen everything amen as long as we are focusing on the Lord God set us it blessed with the name of the Lord keep your attention Eyes On Christ your ears on the word and keep moving on keep your eyes on Jesus praise be to God that Joshua the leader just kept moving on until you possess everything that God promised in his land yes sir with Caleb was forecast brother sister he remembered amen he had relaxed for some time and he told Joshua 40 years ago amen this man had relaxed for 40 years by the Holy Ghost reminded him that he had lost that scent of his Focus he told him sir I have remembered something maybe came that they love him anytime when God when the revelation of God strikes you you tend to have that Joy may become laughing hallelujah praise the Lord and Joshua was hey what's wrong brother Caleb oh my brother I feel like prophesying do you know what 40 years ago amen said you know what brother you know what Pastor give me my mountain yes sir praise be to God he decide time you reached out Pastor Pastor I need a Holy Ghost guide me I've tried this and that but now is the time I feel I need him just right now amen every year that elapsed Things become harder and harder and the grace is turning back to the Jews blessed with the name of the Lord so we should not allow the yah to elapse when we have not achieved what we ought to do blessed be the name of the Lord you have a promise in the word for me I mean I I it's high time we see God moving in our midst but that's going to take determination it's going to take you and me to focus on the Lord to read the scriptures and know our blessings and know our belonging amen what belongs to us blessed be the name of the Lord you never maybe Caleb was even reading because this is the title did for the Jews maybe he was there one day then I remembered oh where God says hey wait a minute maybe this man had even multiplied where he was and it was maybe think of getting another land somewhere and then he remembered that oh I have a mountain do you know how big the mountain is oh there is a man with a tighter teeth the man who came out amen blessed with the name of the Lord Jesus is our mother title amen each one of us has a deed blessed with the name of the Lord so you have to go to Jesus say Jesus I Need My Passion just right now praise be to God amen he says until you possess everything brother everything means everything we must possess everything my sister there you must possess your sight the devil can hold your sight any longer blessed be the name of the Lord amen you have a scripture to challenge Jesus praise the Lord they have to use the testimony he had acquired to put diet down the devil has no right to Hold Your Side no sir that ever has no right Jesus paid for everything on the cross at the same time we claim for our possession healing is ours fully I am the Lord gonna witness all your diseases blessed be the name of the Lord if you read the message blind but to buy us the prophet drama ties that he's saying this man had his eyes that fast blessed be the name of the Lord in time came and this man became a blind man but he remembered the
