prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech thee O Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah wept soul and it came to pass before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the Lord came unto him saying turn again the captain of my people thus saith the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have heard my prayer Hallelujah I have seen the tears behold I will heal thee on the third day Thou shalt go up into the house of the Lord and I will add unto thy days 15 years and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this city of mine for my own sake and for my servant David is sick and Isaiah said take a lamp of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered praise the name of the Lord is team um Jehovah acapora [Music] amen amen verses I like us brother together to read verses 5 verse 5. and then you will also read it and read what I read he says turn again until Hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I'm speaking to you on I have heard thy prayer is the name of the Lord our God is a faithful God if there is one thing you will foreign [Music] God must have felt a large of Faith you know if there is something God can't stand change to go away the prophet of God was the prophet was going out of the door Angel of the Lord I have heard thy prayer dance Papa oh hallelujah hallelujah when a child of God before the Lord he has your prayer right there and I know as Believers were so attending we go through a lot of suffering and afflictions part of our Christian Journey um sometimes you get desperate sometimes we are depressed and you see the devil's plan is to keep us focused on those things adults and we forget that God has equipped us always thank you as Believers they're attending we are not exempt from problems we are not sailing at this good thing we are sailing through sailing through family is a journey full of problems we are desperate times we are sick sometimes we need a job maybe sometimes you know we want God to do something in our homes and the devil wants us to be focused on those things the solution but the word and prayer will never face is also and the prophets the prophet says here in a message a second-handed rope um this morning that many are becoming discouraged what do you need brother is to take courage foreign [Applause] anyway but wait God come down now he began to speak Hallelujah to go away trials will come here so you know we are we will never promise to be immune for us he will give Grace to God through them if the mountain is too high to go over there just don't worry but keep your eyes on clouds don't worry foreign any believer he didn't say some pastors or some ministers [Applause] so spiritual that you can prayers for children you can never foreign Hallelujah for guns not everybody can carry it is no matter your status you can never be a sinner that I can't pray sister what you have done as an ambassador can I tell you God boldly before the throne of grace as long as you're a Christian prayer is where is the only communication medium between it will defeat the Devil prayer and the world in a place and every bullet is foreign Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory in a message Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever I believe some place says that the Devils Tremble When the weakest of a saint goes to their knees um foreign [Music] foreign the weakest of a Christian remember Hallelujah I wonder if the brothers can give me more sound so I don't lose my voice sounds Hallelujah in Ephesians 6 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit is all perseverance and supplication for All Saints praying always say submit yourself James 4 7 submit yourself therefore to God oh James is [Music] foreign [Music] and here were the passions and the meds as you know people that were serving the king they saw how excellent Daniel was he wanted to destroy him they wanted to remove him Visa I tell you what he never knows how powerful you are Suarez the Bible says like a roaring lion of your life foreign [Music] the Devil May at least let you even listen to the world let you go to Church because he knows God says if my people who are those people stupid ity we took on him those are not lutherans are awesome Hallelujah if they shall humble themselves [Applause] [Music] you know so what do I take them realize the only thing they can do to him from prayer they made the law foreign writing was signed his house the devil doesn't want you to pray but what should you do then this man assembled he found Daniel praying making his application before his God then they came near and speak before the king concerning the king's decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or any other man within 30 days save the of thee or King shall be cast into the Den of Lions answered and said according to the law of the meds and the passions which are out or if not anymore which is which regardless not the or King no of the decree that thou has signed and maketh his petition three times a day now listen to verse 14. 14. then the king when he had these words and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him look Vice till the going down of the sun to deliver him I want to ask you a question did the king delivered foreign did the kingdom no systems of the world are going to deliver you no one can deliver you time of Crisis that's why the Bible says cast be he that trusts in another man no one can deliver us some people who love connections solution [Music] I want to say our help comes from the Lord foreign [Applause] Hallelujah in prayer and as she prayed God answered I Believe by the end of the third day I've received an Angelic visitors she's also a type of Christ when she came before him to come uninvited everybody was like foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] let us talk about prayer tonight [Applause] foreign [Applause] Mata and when he reached there oh my goodness as they saw a praying man coming down they saw somebody that was about them connection Hallelujah that is the connection of a Believer no connection is gonna marry let me tell you we are not a simple people are this one won't show you if we are prayer the Lord will be there in the lion is 10. what is your 10 tonight maybe I've experienced it for years until uh until the devil told you that God will never answer your prayers news for he is right on time you know they waited for Jesus and Jesus was not coming is Jesus was not coming until the boy died four days later Jesus shows up you might think he is always right on time foreign I have heard thy prayer Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when I hear it but it begins to foreign in the message believe in God therefore that's the reason the prayer of faith shall serve the sick and individual's prayer they fix your father in prayer of a righteousness with his name by being Christians most powerful weapon the world has ever known it even changes everything it will change the mind of God it did do it after death was pronounced I want to tell you also hold on foreign [Music] you will leave my sister you will not die my way and it says when God had already announced his death hallelujah hallelujah he said because that he prayed so if prayer is that powerful oh my we don't realize how good it is foreign let me show you something else that prayer does a man of God in the book of Acts give us Acts chapter 12 verse 5. Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing for him when their Pastor was in prison always pray for your pastor pray for the men and labor because the devil wants to put them in a prison instead of talking about them foreign [Music] foreign foreign my mind did you hear that machine's greatest prayer brings down angels as they were praying somewhere else chains they
