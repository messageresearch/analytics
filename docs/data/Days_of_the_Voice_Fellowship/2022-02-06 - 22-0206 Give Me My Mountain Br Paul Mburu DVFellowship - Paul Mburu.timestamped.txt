[58:53] the backbone of my message today
[58:58] you can see all the wrongs in the church
[59:02] you can feel like you're not prospering
[59:03] anywhere

[1:00:45] call them all to come to my ear
[1:00:48] and receive their promise but
[1:00:55] praise foreign come on
[1:00:59] separated
[1:01:01] but yet
[1:01:03] he loved the people
[1:01:05] he took the reproach of christ
[1:01:08] they even took stone they
[1:01:33] [Music]
[1:01:36] caleb
[1:01:39] instead of caleb dying
[1:01:42] they're the ones who died
[1:01:46] but caleb was persistent
[1:01:50] he was passionate
[1:01:51] gumik
[1:01:52] he even stayed 40 more years in the
[1:01:54] desert
[1:01:58] amen
[1:02:00] but eventually
[1:02:03] he made it to the promised land
[1:02:15] regardless of how something can seem to
[1:02:17] sing songs
[1:02:46] it cannot
[1:03:13] amen we have billy graham
[1:03:16] prior inaudible but you cannot find all
[1:03:19] his preachings
[1:03:22] you can just find out for some portions
[1:03:24] of them
[1:03:27] but maybe they are not even more than 20
[1:03:29] or fifteen
[1:03:31] videos
[1:03:33] and yet there were even more famous
[1:03:34] preachers than brother branham
[1:03:38] union of singapore
[1:03:39] they are robots
[1:03:41] they were all their great preachers
[1:03:44] but their summers were never recorded
[1:03:46] continuously
[1:03:50] because they did not have the message of
[1:03:51] the house
[1:03:54] they did not have the vision of christ
[1:03:56] in this generation
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:32] amina
[1:04:34] now they finally entered the promised
[1:04:36] land diamond
[1:04:37] center and you see they started
[1:04:38] conquering
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:51] is not selfish
[1:05:20] bless my brother
[1:06:17] instead actually the business seems like
[1:06:19] it's going down down down down ah
[1:06:23] and there is another brother
[1:06:27] who just went and bought something and
[1:06:29] started a business
[1:06:37] [Music]
[1:06:44] and then
[1:07:01] [Applause]
[1:07:09] [Music]
[1:07:12] of course we are human beings
[1:07:15] and we are exposed to this condition
[1:07:19] but after all the depression and all
[1:07:22] that conditions
[1:07:26] when your brother is being
[1:07:34] the bible says i believe that god is not
[1:07:37] like a human being
[1:07:39] he is not first forget the labors of
[1:07:41] life
