========================================

I mean so in the book of second Peter chapter 3 verse 9. the Lord is not luck concerning his promise as some men counts likeness but is long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance [Music] amen the Lord is but it's long-suffering and we want to talk about the patience of God amen amen so we find that uh Peter right here Christian [Music] because Peter represents a very let me say normal life of a human being and his life with with God remember Peter was out fishing sometimes Jesus never found him self he found him out there in the in the in the lake fishing just a common man like you and me doing his Daily Business Peter was married he had a wife and children amen so he was just a normal human being just living his business people knew him as a fisherman when they wanted good fish one man that was always mentioned amen so he was just a common man out there in his normal business [Music] foreign [Applause] and I know when fish can come [Applause] oh yeah [Applause] amen man so he's looked at Jesus yes another Common Man Jesus was just another company by the sight of man amen amen but Jesus even the evening before when Peter Was preparing to go and fish yesterday Joe wherever Jesus was maybe 15 miles away so far away but when Peter was washing the fish to go to that River Jesus was saying Peter yes that there's no single fish coming here amen amen that's the Jesus he knows what you are pursuing he even says that he knows your needs he knows every desire foreign [Applause] amen and he created that situation and Peter came and labored president he could have blamed the moon because he knows the moon controls the waters so he may have really pointed at the moon and say why did the clouds come today he may have turned to the brothers I told you Brothers you know that's normally what happens to a human being it is because of you it is because of something else even we blame ourselves because I was born in this family it is because I was born in this region because I was born in Africa it is because I [Applause] and when the man came out foreign amen I mean I need to please God he looks at it this is very good Hallelujah so now we blame everything we blame our situations [Music] [Music] that God knows everybody God loves everybody even provides food to the terrorists never foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign so Jesus came his way Peter are the most unexpected times maybe Peter's not dreaming about it he was dreaming about the fish maybe he had a good tender from somewhere to deliver fish worth 50 million in that Community but he was one more than Peter or more than there were 50 million he was God himself and he came his way God came his way he had to pass this way and tonight Jesus is passing this he has to pass this way and to tell you my brother I'll tell you my sisters God does not just want you to suffer God is not a regular sea he's not a Rastafarian it is the Rastafarians who says that I was born to suffer amen [Applause] [Applause] born to suffering that is for other people not for the children of God Jesus was not born to suffer yesterday he was born to go through suffering yes yes but his Destiny he was not suffering others he could still be in hell today but we know amen amen he was only for a short time and he never went to fight the devil he went to kick the devil he went to bring down the devil okay bring Deliverance to the captives to set us free amen so you are not born to suffice but because of your current situation because of the sickness oh the doctors have said only amen Amina my diabetes my constant headache my constant chest engage we are here my Jesus hallelujah amen and who is this my Jesus he is My Savior by Victory he is talk about Jesus let's talk about Jesus when Temptations these diabetes that he signed and brought to me or he forced it on me I'm sending it he's a messiah it goes back to the center we are sending diabetes back to them we are sending cancer back to the center it doesn't belong to me when I was in the mind of God when I was in the mind of God there was nothing like pregnancy coming up when I was in the mind of God there was nothing like that Uganda hallelujah amen we were in another Empire and foreign haha um Oh Glory to God regardless see song of the economic conditions of this what is the forest here area forests all animals can complain and talk about the conditions and they talk about Russia and now they are restricting the grain to come to Africa for the lion in mabira foreign these blessings the blessings of the Bible of the Bible they are not for Pentacles those blessings are for the Bride of Jesus Christ dreams and Visions they were just curious to bring it to the children who are the spirit of Elijah to those who are the spiritual Brothers we are the only ones who overrides all the Divine Promises of God amen amen [Music] thank you [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] because that's that's what we identified with him brother [Music] is the message that will bring [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and now Peter the difference between Christians and Christians I didn't get it bro there is a difference between Christians Christians amen I mean because we have the painted Christians I am I'm Christian I don't know it's called The Godfather original [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] foreign foreign [Applause] to light the candle close the candle outside there at midday hey misena I will not ask why a candle candle during the day [Applause] or if Jesus says it yes it may not make sense the patience of God we are reading where we are friends with Jesus [Applause] when Jesus speaks yes it may not be istan may not be understood if I can just take him out his words something will happen that's why I tell you my brother the Lord describes [Applause] will materialize maybe the ninth day [Music] [Applause] none of us [Music] because with [Applause] this generation is filled with haste um amen the prophet says here in this Philadelphia age amen that this this age is filled with worry it's filled with a lot of haste good good good yeah and this virtue of patience it has completely you know gone away from the heart of people soon because the world is so much in haste is to say you know quick things happening quickly mango mango just send a message get ten thousand or I mean ten thousand twenty fifty thousand um [Music] you know just send a message just you know pressing here and suddenly get a big house but that's not with God it is not to the children of Abraham Philadelphia there it is Abraham was tried after he received the Word of Promise maybe before he received a promise his life was easy no trials and most things that as soon as we pray Jesus name over the good Promises of God and says that there cannot be a trial oh but here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise have you received a promise [Applause] oh he says that that is exactly correct until the time that his word came in that's talking about Joseph the word of the Lord God gives us exceeding great and precious promises [Applause] do we believe the Bible is full of God's promises great and precious [Applause] there is [Applause] a race to learn oh Lord [Applause] in our foreign over impatience you just need to work here in the streets as you cross the road you see there's a car coming very much you have to step aside but just
