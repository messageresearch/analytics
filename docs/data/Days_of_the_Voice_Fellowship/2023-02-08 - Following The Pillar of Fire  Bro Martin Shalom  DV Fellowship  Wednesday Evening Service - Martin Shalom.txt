to lead them the way and by night in the pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and by night and he took away and he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day narrow the pillar of Fire by night from before the people is blessed in the name of the Lord amen I trust all of us whoever heard about the pillar of Fire and even uh there is the picture of the Prophet which had that Hollow of light on his head and he tells us that is the very Pillar of Fire s praise the Lord amen and I'm here tonight to talk about uh we are following the pillar of fire praise the Lord I believe it is such a wonderful thing because you will you cannot meet the pillar of fire and you remain the same and what we need tonight we need to encounter the pillar of fire amen the message we are believing it was Vindicated by God himself and by revelation we know that we are not following man we are following the pillar of fire blessed to be the name of the Lamb come and give us the angel you can call him the angel of the Lord amen the Bible says that Moses went before them and the Lord went before them in the pillar of clouds remember in Old Testament nobody couldn't see God face to face and uh remember another thing the expression of Israel out of Egypt it was done by God himself praise the Lord and God was putting on that period he was hiding the pillar of clouds give them shade from the Sun according to lead them in the way because they didn't know where they were going when God called them [Applause] to lead them praise the Lord he knows the way he knew where he was taking them that was his work praise be to God because he was leading them through the way Jesus said I'm the way of the truth nobody can go to the father enters praise be to God so God knew where he was taking them and he was doing the work of redemption Pillar of Fire we thank God for the message we have believed by God and even today we are not left alone We are following the pillars amen and he says by night in the pillar of fire to give them the light yet if it is running here and there praise the Lord man where we are living today the Bible tells us in Isaiah of the gross Darkness I will cover the world praise the Lord so we needed a pillar of fire again showing us praise be to God Amen to give them the light to go by there and by night not only by the cinema amen I mean thou shall not be scared of that Terror that moves in the night praise be to God God is there to protect us God wants us to follow him he want us to follow the pillar of fire every time you pick a message amen there is something behind it and that is the pillar of fire the prophet never went to the pillow fights it was not there for him it was for the pride amen and when he finishes The Cloud of Glory is moving that Cloud of Glory is the pillar of clouds move with the clouds Amen brother blessed with the name of the Lord Jesus let us read another scripture in Nehemiah Nehemiah chapter 9 verses 19 I want to show you something here is yet thou in in thy manifold masses for Success them not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud Departed the north from them by day to lead them in the way is leading them in the way yes sir wow neither the pillar of Fire by night to show them the light and the way where in they should go Empire is there to show you the way you should go um he did not forsook them in the wilderness the Bible says they moved for 40 years for 40 years and God was with them the Bible says even their shoes never got older even work lovers never caught blessed with the name of the Lord what man is not to happen that was the presence of the pillar of fire that was God who was moving with them amen says Musa blessed be the name of the Lord which Moses had um I am the Lord God will healeth thy diseases if you are sick he is the Lord do you know how many children were born in one night in the wilderness [Music] do you think nurses were there blessed be the name of the Lord but what hope then what happens take care of them to take care of their knees says that you see some time you are looking at the messenger instead of the message and God shut the door no matter it was talking about the time of nowhere when Noah came preaching the ghosts he was despised but no hard the voice of God because when God met him he was there alone the other voice alone amen so Noah was under instructions like during the first Exodus the children of Israel when under instructions [Music] was to keep them in the way yeah [Applause] praise the Lord no matter how kind-hearted Noah was [Applause] shutting and opening whatever he wants because he heard the voice of God he was following the instructions told him the kind of tree was supposed to use blessed be the name of the Lord and this man was following instructions he had a message for his foreign foreign [Applause] [Applause] but what was coming out of Moses not only [Applause] [Applause] that's where is the one who knows the way that same Jesus who worked with Moses yes it was in Moses amen [Applause] and praise be to God amen the woman at the well if she hadn't been really consecrated to what that she was listening to oh much what are you listening to tonight blessed with the name of the Lord amen Mina the reason as to why in Pentecostal nomination you find people are not changing it is because of what they are listening to in sunga kubanga is amen amen there is no conviction at all because you come as you are and you go back the same not that your church it is because of what we are listening to shift blessed be the name of the Lord but if you listen to this Holy Ghost Gospel God will settle your heart on fire the desperation amen because you will know that you don't need comedy that you need the Living God and you speak like deputy yeah gameplay after leaving God When shall I come before him blessed me the name of the Lord so friends one we tonight we are following the pillars we have not started today this is the Faith of Our Fathers we shall follow it until we die amen is not stopping here was in the wilderness it was in Exodus appeared to those who are ready to see him blessed with the name of the Lord many times people look at the blessed with the name of the Lord the foundation of the world you ain't going to deceive them homogeneous because they are lying right in that word when they see those things appearing that become but if you just let God do it gets the word in you [Applause] amen that's why we need to follow him he knows the way yeah [Applause] what was doing that as long as they followed it on something was happening sometimes you're following him but you don't know that something is happening in your life in the name of the Lord that's why the Bible says not only seek him without those things blessed be the name of the Lord let us look for God where God is there is Victory amen where God is there is life as long as he was leading them oh brother sister I have never read anybody who was operated during birth in the wilderness amen he was nice praise be to God Amen God wants to be here to sell for us yes sir I mean it's your Alpha the alpha is your Omega the Omega yes open our eyes and by the way he knows our heart God knows our ambition he knows what you are planning amen some say God God knows those will follow him acquired what they wanted and they quit he knows them blessed with the name but let us catch the revelation of Joshua and Khalid amen they were not looking at what was surrounding them foreign [Applause] things went wrong things went wrong for them blessed be the name of the Lord but there are men who are following the pillar of fire not everything that appears the pillar of Fire maybe these guys were following numbers guys they were two boys from from India India when they looked at the sky but actually brothers something told them this is not ordinary Skye something must have happened somewhere amen and I went back to do their search blessed with the name of the Lord when you heard the voice of God something spoke to your heart you saw something special that is what they sow Jesus was born [Music] praise be to God so brother sister We are following the pillar of fire tonight as long as this guys follow the field after running the sixth time the world was still intact blessed with the name of the Lord that's why a True Believer you are not looking at the sign don't you understand or to look at the promise me to God because if they were looking at the signs they have already surrounded six times seven times probably some of them even put the ear to hear what is going on but the world probably was becoming Harder by by their physical eyes but let me tell you something the spiritual something was happening blessed with the name of the Lord when they were in the sick the seventh time very first round number one just remember the seventh day okay seven times something was happening why because they're following the pillars the captain of the host of the Lord they were following that pillars to work it out for them amen Jesus told them yes just told her to come and follow me this man did not mind about any other thing is Peter who asked started following him amen amen when Elijah met Elijah Metallica he came and hit on him and then he moved you know again this man knew amen that was an ordinary touch that was the hand of God yes send me the name of the Lord praise be to God amen amen but if you let God hear he says in in the message putting on the whole armor of God he will just let God do it it will get the word in you blessed be the name of the Lord if you read if you read uh in John chapter 15 verses through the word which I have spoken unto you already amen Amen brother now you are clean through the words you are hearing already that's what Jesus said yes you are now clean through the world the word in you it is the washing praise be to God it was the word in the prophets it was the word in the sun it was the word in you today it is the word prophesied amen prophesied promise blessed with the name of the Lord so what are we following tonight we are following the period of five amen We are following him every day as long as you're following him we are not going to stumble in darkness inspiration work will not burden us amen I mean sometimes we look at the control storm [Music] yes praise be to God man but remember Jesus is in the boat it is I believe we've ever read a footprint on the sound of time footprint or the sound of time praise to God and the story goes like this [Music] he saw that he saw or sometimes it's true Footprints you and when when it reaches the hard times and then he was complaining to the Lord but when things are okay that's when he moves with the Lord but when things become hard it's him moving alone but let me tell you Brothers many times when we are going through our situations amen because it's a Good Shepherd of the ship or I am assume if you've ever read a ship praise you to God sometimes when you're going into the thickets and there is the little lamb which you know that cannot maneuver maybe sons of ever red animals praise be to God man that is what God does that's why God gave us the pillar of fire to leave the church give us the light in this way is here tonight everybody of Christ wherever they are good I will never leave you alone I will come and be with you not only for one day not for a visit but until the end of the world [Music] as long as the Church of Christ is still here the purchase of God the ransomed of God because we are born by God's own place be to God even as I'm speaking right now that blood is women amen and remember God is looking to me to see what I say in the world amen man and I'm looking to you to see that you carry out the word blessed be the name of the Lord and he went out to her again and spoke peace to her on you praise be to God We are following the pillar of Fire praise be to God amen Amina God was failing Moses and God was in Moses in the presence of the presence of God was in him God is failing brother the presence of God is in him God is spelled in you when his presence is God is failing us a museum the Bible says [Music] [Applause] you are being charged here praise be to God there isn't asked why the word is being preached and as long as we keep listening to the word I'm praying over this world attending Services something is changing in your life amen and God is filling you God is judging you blessed be the name of the Lord he was so perfect with that word in him really hard to fail his face it was communicated Prophet that unfolded the word and told them amen man it was Vindicated Prophet that unfolded the word and gave it to them all these men who are running here and there they don't have their messages they come with this very message it is just edited praise be to God and that's why when does became problem in the wilderness that's sunny uh I believe the Lord's when the Lord spoke to Moses not he never had that voice praise be to God man when God told Moses separate yourself from them amen man maybe this man so this way we're separating Moses with the tricks I don't know what has he has brought tonight but amen let no man make you doubt your experience in the line with the word of God there are some people who are there one word for them their work is they want to disprove you that you never met God praise be to God are you sure you received the Holy ghosts are you are you sure and so said he
