welcome the different brothers that have come to be with us tonight uh [Applause] [Music] is is [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] and although you might have looked like very young is my wife my in-laws um is oh this oh [Music] so [Music] online god bless you has done strange things to us just like here we have had to stream services from our church [Music] [Music] [Music] to be here with you especially our pastor brother ed bischo and his associate brother tom ray no yeah he said be sure to greet the bride in uganda [Music] the last couple days yes that's the only language i know but uh so we were there and brother and so we're [Music] there's a curfew and there's time is going on so let's take our bibles turn to the word of god we'll stand together as we read the word of god [Music] [Music] is [Music] well i i want to just say just before we read it's an honor to be here for the bus church we've been connected for [Music] if we surrender to the lord just [Music] to every hero [Music] psalms 1 and verse 1 says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor sitted nor standings i'm sorry in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate day and night [Music] and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf off also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper [Music] there's a kind of a funny question that says if you were a tree what kind of a tree would you be and if i was a tree i'd want to be a tree planted by the rivers of water [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's just necessary that the the seed pull the nutrients out of the ground and then [Applause] was already in the last days [Music] is the reason i'm saying prosperity is talking about prosperity of and if purposes stay in the word of god [Music] of god [Music] we've got ministers here he says if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body those good treasures that are available to faithful sailors [Music] [Applause] your car is foreign i was i was i was telling the believers i can't remember where i was probably several places i was telling them you know you have to realize that capitalism will fail [Music] i'd rather have my money in the bank of heaven let's talk about so let's talk about biblical prosperity [Music] and abraham had a son called isaac do you believe him [Music] [Music] about the lord had made his [Music] a is [Music] [Applause] his purpose [Music] that was given as ministers we are only successful we are only prosperous and that we take the message of god [Music] ah amen then you shall be prospered is [Music] [Applause] he was thrown into a place yeah [Music] nothing wrong [Applause] oh [Music] no [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] do you believe that's your purpose the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout out [Applause] shall rise forever [Music] if you're not planted in the right place [Music] then but david says now my son the lord all right [Music] but it wasn't the blessing of david that prospered solomon goes on and he says the lord [Music] is [Music] he says [Music] [Applause] [Music] to fulfill the statutes and judgments [Music] is [Music] [Music] catch this picture [Music] beloved [Music] [Music] [Music] all right [Music] stay in the world [Music] [Music] not financial so prosperity solomon had great riches they know that government away from the word of god began to lose visions [Music] but he didn't stay in the world the bible says he's landed like behind by the rivers of war where does the river come from it comes from the mountains [Music] it starts from rain the rain comes in the mountains that river blessings to israel [Music] so in egypt their crops were uh were increased by their old laborers [Applause] my blessings blessings of god god [Music] god [Music] by the message when god sends his anointing to the world [Music] [Music] [Applause] ain't nobody is [Applause] now come back to that in just a moment [Music] to bring israel into captivity because of their disobedience [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign he says [Music] his human spirit out of him and put an animal spirit into him [Music] [Music] [Music] he lost his your body [Applause] the holy spirit [Music] it's always been the same so there's blessings on anointing to preach is different than the anointing to prayer so there's anointings to individuals you know there's blessings that we look through why do we dedicate our children accountability [Music] is and so we see that there's different places in blessings age church ages there's four living creatures around the throne of god [Music] [Music] is because the seeds [Applause] [Music] million martyrs [Applause] gives him a revelation is [Applause] amen sometimes we don't realize the time in here [Music] what was happening when god does something [Applause] [Music] um [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] the purpose [Applause] yes has chosen the [Applause] a greater portion of heaven awaits us [Applause] [Music] the prosperity of that decision is made known [Music] i realize i'm pressed for time so i'm trying to just hit the thought in he says so the anointing in one day [Music] that's why i took a message to show us the rapture is a process [Music] [Music] into the [Music] around the world council of churches [Music] [Music] and the [Music] it's an anointing [Applause] [Music] recognizing your day and age [Music] [Applause] uh and there are godly in his church in shreveport in the united states i mean so the services that are in shreveport are in jack moore's church [Music] one of them was uh um what's that thanksgiving message invisible union so it says that their paper uh okay i see you've got the quote up here for me all right he says of the hero of his coming one of the finest papers on the field he says [Music] [Music] my name all of you pray why do they do that [Music] is [Music] and he says they have not recognized the awakening of the bride [Applause] of the hour [Music] that's what's making them feel that way [Music] is [Applause] and they're trying to go back to what they used [Applause] but they haven't recognized [Applause] god [Applause] [Applause] is [Applause] me is into the jesus and he says he sat in the synagogue is [Applause] [Music] so jesus has handed the book to read yes and he looks in the book now and he picks this scripture on the collection and he's in 61 and verse 1. the spirit of the lord is upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach the tidings unto the me oh i could spend some time on that one he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of prisoners the opening of the prison to them that are bound [Music] [Applause] [Music] the king james bible [Applause] that's the middle of the verse but jesus reading it says this day the scriptures [Music] such an anointing and here he was with that type of anointing [Music] what the bible says [Music] [Music] foreign is [Music] is it will bring us exactly how to operate in this hour [Music] [Applause] um [Applause] amen he says is themselves [Applause] um [Music] exactly what and how he rebuilt the altar trench around [Applause] [Applause] yourself [Applause] revelation is the most important thing you will ever have [Applause] [Music] revelation is more important israel came out of egypt [Applause] [Music] they were let out [Applause] paul says the is a revelation so which is more important all those miracles or the revelations because of revelation [Music] because the
