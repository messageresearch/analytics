[36:35] generator and U I understand it was
[36:38] affecting online
[36:42] service a little bit
[36:45] here but
[36:47] nevertheless that's why we we should
[36:49] always come to church
[36:53] physically never stay at at home and say
[36:55] I will stream
[37:00] that day God visits the
[37:03] church you who has been at home
[37:06] streaming you miss out you remember in

[37:29] de if you cannot or if you really
[37:33] B come to
[37:36] church so this evening I just want to I
[37:39] have a little thought on more than a
[37:40] movement more than a
[37:49] denomination tell your neighbor more
[37:51] than a
[37:53] movement more than a denomination
[37:57] [Music]
[37:59] this is what this what we believe
[38:01] is this is what we are we are more than
[38:05] a
[38:06] movement we are more than a
[38:09] denomination you see we are not a
[38:12] religion we are not a
[38:14] denomination we are not just a movement
[38:18] We Are The Church of Jesus
[38:20] Christ we are the people that God is
[38:22] preparing for the coming for his
[38:26] coming he has a people on earth in every
[38:30] generation that he has been
[38:34] preparing I believe we are one of those
[38:36] in our generation that God is
[38:40] preparing for his coming I have um
[38:44] really some things deep on my heart this
[38:46] evening I hope that the Lord will help
[38:48] me to give me utterance to uh speak
[38:50] those things to
[38:54] you you see here in the Book of Matthew
[38:56] 16
[38:59] you know Jesus was asking the disciples
[39:00] who he
[39:03] was first of all he asked them who the
[39:05] people said he
[39:07] was and uh you know they said some say
[39:10] you are Isaiah Jeremiah you
[39:15] ofet and so then he said but how about
[39:18] you who do you say that I
[39:20] am then Peter by
[39:23] Revelation notice by
[39:26] revelation he said Thou Art Jesus Christ
[39:30] the son of the Living
[39:33] God and uh then Jesus answered and said
[39:35] unto him blessed thou Simon
[39:40] Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[39:43] revealed it unto
[39:45] thee but my Father which is in
[39:49] heaven and I say also unto
[39:52] you you who has received that
[39:55] Revelation that you are p
[39:58] and Upon This
[39:59] Rock I will build my church I will build
[40:03] my
[40:04] what my
[40:06] denomination my
[40:08] movement My Religion he said my what my
[40:13] church I will build my
[40:18] church
[40:20] Christ cannot be
[40:22] defeated if I am the church I know the
[40:26] devil will fight me but he cannot defeat
[40:29] me because I am amen I am built upon a
[40:34] rock and the Gates of Hell shall not
[40:37] Prevail against
[40:39] me and he says I give you the
[40:42] keys but before we get into that I want
[40:44] to read you a quote
[40:47] here in the message the revelation of
[40:50] Jesus
[40:52] Christ he says the importance of
[40:55] Revelation
[40:58] by the spirit Revelation by the spirit
[41:01] to a True Believer can never be
[41:10] overemphasized Revelation means more to
[41:13] you than perhaps you
[41:18] realize now I am not talking about this
[41:20] book of Revelation and
[41:23] you I am talking about all revelation
[41:28] it is tremendously important to the
[41:32] church and then he says do you remember
[41:34] in Matthew 16 where we have just
[41:37] read where Jesus asked the disciples
[41:40] this
[41:41] question whom do men say that I the son
[41:43] of man
[41:45] am and they said some said that thou
[41:48] John the
[41:49] Baptist some elas and others Jeremiah oh
[41:54] one of the prophets but he said unto
[41:57] them but whom say ye that I
[42:00] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[42:04] thou the Christ the son of the Living
[42:06] God and Jesus answered and said unto him
[42:10] blessed thou Simon
[42:12] B for flesh and blood has not revealed
[42:14] it unto
[42:15] thee but my Father which is in
[42:18] heaven and I say unto you that thou
[42:22] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[42:26] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[42:29] Prevail against
[42:30] you and so now here the prophet says
[42:33] these
[42:34] words the Roman Catholics say that the
[42:37] church is built upon
[42:42] Peter now that is really
[42:45] can how could God build the church Upon
[42:48] A man so
[42:52] unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus
[42:55] and cast while doing it
[42:59] God cannot build his church upon any man
[43:02] born in
[43:06] sin the Church of Jesus is not built
[43:09] upon the foundation of any
[43:12] man it's not buil upon any man
[43:16] brother it's not built upon Peter it's
[43:19] not built upon John he not built upon
[43:22] Paul are you hearing me he's not even B
[43:25] buil upon brother bham
[43:27] the Church of Jesus is not built upon
[43:30] any
[43:31] man but I want I want you to continue
[43:33] here and say he says um God can build
[43:36] his church upon any man born in
[43:41] sin you see many
[43:43] denominations many of them have a
[43:45] foundation of a
[43:47] man but this message we preach is not
[43:52] built upon any
[43:55] man and it wasn't some rock lying there
[43:59] as though God had hallowed the ground at
[44:01] that
[44:05] spot and it isn't the Protestants as the
[44:08] protests say as the Protestants say that
[44:10] the church is built upon
[44:21] Jesus was the one that the church was
[44:23] built
[44:25] upon no it was the
[44:28] Revelation and he said read it the way
[44:30] it is
[44:33] written not you know headed by a
[44:37] man the Church of Jesus is not does not
[44:40] have a system of governance on
[44:45] Earth the Church of Jesus is
[44:47] headquartered in
[44:50] heaven and the foundation of
[44:54] it is re who received that
[44:58] Revelation is part of that
[45:01] church amen I became part of that church
[45:06] when I Reed the spiritual revelation of
[45:08] the
[45:10] word and um and uh let let us look at
[45:14] spiritual
[45:16] Revelation how did Abel know what to do
[45:19] in order to offer a proper sacrifice to
[45:24] God how did AB know
[45:27] how to offer a spiritual
[45:29] sacrifice a spiritual proper
[45:34] Sacrifice by
[45:36] Faith by faith he received the
[45:39] revelation of the
[45:42] blood Kan did not get such a
[45:46] revelation even though he had a
[45:50] commandment so he could not offer the
[45:52] right
[45:54] sacrifice it was a
[46:01] the Seminary
[46:02] teaches and though it might be told to
[46:05] you with
[46:07] eloquence listen church until God
[46:11] reveals to you you
[46:13] you that Jesus is the
[46:17] Christ and that it is the blood that
[46:19] cleanses
[46:21] you and that God is your
[46:23] savior until God comes down
[46:27] by the way Revelation comes from
[46:29] Heaven
[46:32] re it is the spiritual
[46:35] Revelation that does
[46:38] it hallelujah
[46:40] amen you can come to church and here are
[46:44] preaching here are preaching every
[46:47] service and you never understand it and
[46:50] you never come to that
[46:52] Revelation until you yield yourself well
[46:55] enough
[46:57] that's why I always say when a preacher
[46:59] is
[47:00] preaching don't hear the the preacher's
[47:08] words and hear from another word and
[47:11] hear another voice and hear a different
[47:15] sound that's why many times you find
[47:17] people
[47:18] shouting why that person has connected
[47:21] to another
[47:24] sound he has received personal
[47:28] Revelation it is beyond what the
[47:29] preacher is
[47:31] saying that's why some people can even
[47:34] shout and they even stop hearing what
[47:36] the preacher is
[47:37] saying and some people are
[47:40] offended they're saying they're even
[47:42] making me not
[47:43] here why because this
[47:49] person something that makes you
[47:52] understand things without even hearing
[47:54] what a man is saying
[47:57] something which makes you see yourself
[48:00] as a spirit not a not not a
[48:05] flesh am I communicating to someone this
[48:08] evening something which makes you say
[48:14] a when you the more you keep coming to
[48:17] church amen because you see Revelation
[48:19] is
[48:20] Faith and it comes by hearing the word
[48:24] it comes by hearing the word the more
[48:27] you hear the word the more faith is
[48:29] building up and one of these days while
[48:34] you are seated right there in your seat
[48:36] you will hear the word and you will hear
[48:39] your name being
[48:40] called and it will become a personal
[48:45] experience that is what we call a
[48:47] personal
[48:50] experience Hallelujah and this message
[48:53] is not a set of teachings
[48:57] this message is more than teachings is
[49:01] more than Church
[49:02] order more than
[49:13] rules the Church of
[49:16] Jesus is in the
[49:19] Homeland Hallelujah and today we'll talk
[49:22] a little bit about the homeland of the
[49:24] church it is more than
[49:27] movement tell your neighbor is more than

[1:01:15] historian to write me and tell me
[1:01:18] whenever whenever and tell me whenever

[1:01:36] Luan
[1:01:39] again
[1:01:41] Methodist
[1:01:42] pentec never did and now right now in
[1:01:45] the Pentecostal and and some of these
[1:01:47] denominations they are praying oh God
[1:01:49] send
[1:01:52] Revival Revival they will never get
[1:01:54] again
[1:01:57] you need to understand Revival has
[1:02:00] moved Revival is the pillar of
[1:02:03] cloud Revival is a pill of
[1:02:06] fire and it is
[1:02:08] gone and he moves with those who are
[1:02:10] moving with
[1:02:11] it and where is Revival now is with the
[1:02:16] bride of
[1:02:17] Christ who has understood who she is and
[1:02:19] the how she's leaving
[1:02:22] in amen waiting for the rapture
[1:02:26] Revival is going to culminate into the
[1:02:28] Rapture the change of our
[1:02:32] bodies that organization laid
[1:02:36] there and conquered and
[1:02:39] rotten God took individuals and tried to
[1:02:43] point the people back to the
[1:02:49] Homeland and then the individual so weak
[1:02:53] and sified
[1:02:57] with some kind of a
[1:03:00] degree until they organized another
[1:03:06] organization they made it a twofold
[1:03:08] child more overh than it
[1:03:13] was but
[1:03:20] somewhere that he can put his hands
[1:03:23] upon who will not compromise
[1:03:26] with the ungodly
[1:03:29] organization who will swing the people
[1:03:31] back to the
[1:03:34] Rock back to Christ
[1:03:36] Jesus back to the original
[1:03:39] Pentecost back to the original Holy
[1:03:41] Ghost with original signs and original
[1:03:45] wonders surely God has got
[1:03:49] one somewhere who will not break
[1:03:53] down under any kind of persecution
[1:03:57] who will not run out who will not cancel
[1:04:00] out or fall out
[1:04:04] anything they will stay with
[1:04:10] it brother bam said these
[1:04:13] words in
[1:04:15] 1961 I believe at this time he was
[1:04:18] speaking of his
[1:04:20] message said God has
[1:04:23] someone even if all the others have
[1:04:25] denominated
[1:04:27] but God has someone who will swing
[1:04:29] people back
[1:04:31] to back to Christ Jesus back to the
[1:04:34] original P back to the original Holy
[1:04:37] Ghost signs and
[1:04:39] wonders that's what brother bam
[1:04:43] did he never swung people to
[1:04:47] himself people
[1:04:49] misunderstand this message is not
[1:04:52] William BR it is more than a man
[1:04:56] it is more than a
[1:04:57] church
[1:04:59] amen it is the Church of Jesus
[1:05:04] Christ is the restoration back to the
[1:05:09] Homeland God never blesses Israel till
[1:05:11] she gets to her
[1:05:14] home and it says God will never bless
[1:05:18] you a Methodist
[1:05:21] Baptist cathol
[1:05:27] he will never bless you that
[1:05:31] way come back to the
[1:05:34] Homeland I met a young man from
[1:05:38] Guru while we were in L and you know
[1:05:41] they've been writing me for a while
[1:05:44] now on my email and so when I called him
[1:05:49] and then I notic that is in G
[1:05:52] University so he came down and he met
[1:05:54] with me and I was with pastor
[1:05:57] jofrey and you know he sat through the
[1:05:59] Sunday morning
[1:06:01] service some of his brothers talked to
[1:06:04] him Jeffrey talked to him and then I got
[1:06:07] to talk to him last because I was busy
[1:06:10] the whole
[1:06:11] time now he was already feeling on your
[1:06:16] set
[1:06:19] go because the things he had had it was
[1:06:23] so heavy for him
[1:06:25] he's from Christ Embassy Embassy it was
[1:06:28] so heavy for
[1:06:29] him so heavy for him it was like
[1:06:33] everything were saying was strange to
[1:06:38] him we talked about women
[1:06:40] makup what baptism in the name
[1:06:43] of talk about you know a messenger to
[1:06:46] Our Last Days CH
[1:06:49] ages talked about women
[1:06:52] preachers so I sat down with him
[1:06:57] and you know he told me you know I said
[1:06:59] which church do you come
[1:07:01] from I said I said I'm a
[1:07:04] Christian he said I'm a Christian he
[1:07:07] said I'm non
[1:07:09] denomination I said that's very good I'm
[1:07:12] like you and then he realized now I'm
[1:07:15] going to trap him so he changed quickly
[1:07:19] he said I'm from Christ Embassy EMB I
[1:07:21] said is that not a
[1:07:23] denomination he said no I said what to
[1:07:26] you is a
[1:07:29] denomination and then he said I don't
[1:07:31] understand what is a denomination and I
[1:07:34] told him a
[1:07:36] denomination is a church that has its
[1:07:39] own set of uh uh
[1:07:43] doctrines whether or not they in the
[1:07:46] Bible but they believe it as gospel
[1:07:50] truth and it is the basis of their
[1:07:52] Christianity
[1:07:57] I said so would you then categorize your
[1:07:59] church as a
[1:08:01] denomination and like I said let me give
[1:08:04] you a little more a denomination will
[1:08:08] also have a man and a
[1:08:11] system that they
[1:08:13] r that they rever they
[1:08:15] reverse more than the
[1:08:19] Bible I gave him the example of the
