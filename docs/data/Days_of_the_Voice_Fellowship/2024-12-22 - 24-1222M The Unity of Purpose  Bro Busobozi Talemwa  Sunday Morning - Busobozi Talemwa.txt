and then we can be seated after that we are reading from verses 1 to vers 6 and the whole I'm reading in the name of the Lord and the whole earth was one language and one speech I think they should get you the other microphone it is better and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they that they found a plane in the land of sha and dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make a brick and burn them thoroughly and they had and they had brick for stone and slime they they and SL and slime excuse me and slime had they for M and they said go too let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest will be scattered abroad and the face of the whole earth and the Lord came down to the to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the Lord said because the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do may the Lord add blessings upon the word you may be SE I think the ones of luganda have been following I'm sure you have been following too um just wanting to S on some time God bless you all this morning um I heard from Brother Enoch he said he he needs prayer he's sick not able to be here this morning I'd like to appreciate you all who prayed for us h on our journey to West uh West n in PA I'd like to say God bless you uh your prayers were answered God was with us in the meetings there um um the word was preached Miracles were wrote by the word people were delivered and actually these are not my words words of Pastor nures the host he said that that is the greatest conversion they have ever had in that region these are people who have been in the message for more than 30 years and so we certainly want to thank God for the grace that he gave us uh people came from all over and we had a wonderful conference wonderful conference with God pastor we thank God for pastor side who came from Zimbabwe and also for brother Ken who came from Nairobi so these along with me ministered in the services there and the Lord was gracious we had a problem with the tires of the car but God took us through it all and we arrived back home safely it was a long journey uh but God was good amen amen I mean I'm talking about uh great I cannot explain the great things that God did you had to be there to see um I know some of you follow the meetings online but the prayer line was not streamed of what God did was in that prayer [Music] line ah it was a wonderful time had almost four hours standing praying for people you know I told them that that was not going to be a prayer line I told them it was going to be a healing line God God honored that and God healed people some instantly and you know it was just so beautiful to watch amen uh so receive greetings from also Pastor BTA um I I was in Nairobi uh not Nairobi Western Kenya I think we came back when did we come back Thursday no we came back Wednesday from W and then on on Thursday we traveled to Kenya traveled to brother who was helping us to drive some parts and brother praise and also Pastor Gideon was with us uh Brother s there's a brother who passed on called brother Amani um he was well known to me um he was the father also to Sister Lydia sister Lydia is the wife to brother Timothy they were Deacon he was the Deacon in our church in soothy some of you have heard me mentioned by the Timothy many times uh say what I'm saying say what I'm saying when I'm saying it so we can be able to go together amen all right so um you appreciate brother the brother am amen and so um don't worry about what you'll miss sometimes you miss you get to miss words it's all right just keep moving move with the cloud amen tell him move with the cloud and so brother brother Timothy used to be the Deacon one of our deacons there ethopia uh when we and also he was with us when really we were starting the church and they were very very supportive in the work of God in attend sometimes you would travel Drive 4 hours he would drive four hours coming from a a city called haasa to the church inisa and he was with all family and you know many time many times he was the first to arrive at church so it was quite something interesting they were very committed very committed people and uh so when the sister lost her dad I we really felt that we needed to be there and comfort them so um I was there yes Friday and uh we returned on on yesterday amen we also had a chance to uh fellowship with Pastor Gideon having travel together going and coming back a lot of quality Fellowship that we had and I and we agreed that I'll have to bring him on the bench because there are certain things he was speaking and I was so interested amen um uh uh we are also thankful for our brother um who ministered on Sunday in my absence was the ministry a blessing to you amen we we certainly thank God for that amen I just have a few announcements that I'd like to give before we go into the preaching of the word um if you have a pen and paper please you will need to write some of these things so Wednesday next Wednesday is going to be the 25th um we shall have our I I don't know I was thinking morning but I don't know I thought we have usually a Wednesday service we usually have a Wednesday service on the evening but this is going to be 25th December and so I would want to give you my Christmas message then on that day of 25th um let's see how many can say we can be here early in the morning and we have a morning service how many say well would like to be here in the evening and we have an evening service no many of you are not raising up your hand others cannot don't want to come to church you know people in the message have a problem they even say it's 25th it's Christmas Day oh for us we should not even go to church even some of them they decide to eat doo at DF we don't believe that that's a religious spirit brother bam did not eat doo on Christmas is our example in this generation amen he even decorated his house he even had a Christmas tree do you do you believe that brother was Elijah so don't be more more ho than your Prophet so if the world is doing all the Santa Claus wearing those things and you know they call him father Chan chras for us we don't believe in that in that in those things we don't believe in those that's a religious of deception we also know Jesus was not born on 25th but there is no harm in coming to worship the Jesus will know amen so um uh we will be here regardless on 25 you know even if it was not a service day I wanted to make it a service day you know why there are many of your friends that would want to go to church on Christmas that I've never gone to church or that don't actually go to church they only go wait for Christmas so when they see you you can't even go to church they say you are you pagans so let us be here on onday Wednesday and let us bring our friends on Wednesday and we will teach them the truth about Christmas Chas can I have amens on that amen amen so uh it's not about it's not a matter of having service or not it's a matter of whether morning or evening and I sincerely need to know what you think about it would you like to be here morning or would you like to be here evening how many can how many would like so you can only tell me by show of hands I will see the majority and then we can go by that how many can be here by morning let me see by raising of hands okay you can put it down how many like to be here in the evening okay so the morning take the majority amen so we are going to have a morning a a Wednesday morning service this Wednesday let us have a Revival that day let us bring our friends let us bring our neighbors transport them if you have to f a taxi if you have to bring them to church and let them hear the truth on

announcements this morning um we have made a payment the initial payment for the fellowship place in um and i' I've made that payment by faith believing that you will step in and and and and support um you know when a fellowship is starting uh we can always support uh but not permanently because we are not building a denomination the people there will have also to chip in and support their own [Music] work but you see there many of them are young in the faith and we need to support them in the beginning we shall collect an offering at the end of the service if you have a burden to support that work and be a part of that blessing so a month is 300,000 Shillings and we'll need also to buy a few things like chairs uh Sister Rose you are the one who bought most of these chairs how much is the chair okay 28 25 so if you want to buy a chair two or five we are looking at buying at least 30 to 50 chairs for the start and so these are the needs may God lead you as you think on how you will give brother lumu I'm happy to see you God bless you and all the saints visiting with us this morning amen so I'm tired I don't know how I preach when I'm tired but if you pull on the word ah God will speak to you amen are you expectant this morning are you happy this morning oh your happiness is very low are you happy this morning amen I'm going to speak on a very important subject um it's a something that has been on my heart but you know it came up when I was having a conversation with uh Pastor Gideon speaking in the car usually when I'm speaking with brothers sisters I kind of you know get inspirations and so I got this and I pray that the Lord will use it to bless us especially at the ending of this year and the beginning of the new year I'm going to speak on the unity of purpose the unity of purpose tell your neighbor the unity of purpose I know part of the uh um sister Stella and her two sons I think they are also in Kenya they informed me they went there for family I think wedding or something so I'm going to speak on the unity of purpose the unity of purpose shall we go back again to the place where we read in Genesis 11 and the whole earth was one language and one speech and it came to pass as the Jed from the East they found a plane praise the Lord they found a plane in the land of sha and they there now you have to remember that this is After the flood so these people boundled themselves together in this place and they dwelt in this place and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and they had slime for Mot that is in vers three and so they said now let us build a city and a tower whose to May reach unto Heaven listen listen please listen to me now I you want you to bring all your thoughts together we just get into the word you know the good thing in the message we don't excite people by hallelujah praise God we we are excited by the word amen so put in your heart let us see what the Lord has for us this morning and so they said let us make a name Les we be scattered abroad and face the abroad upon the face of the whole Earth [Music] so they didn't want to spread themselves across the whole earth and you know God came down to see the city they had built and the Tower and the Lord said behold the people is one I want you to hear what God's testimony was about people he said now the people are one they have all one language and this they begin to do nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do do you believe God's testimony brother brother shame if you can give me more sound not louder but a little heavier if you can please thank you so you see that you know God gave a testimony that these people cannot be restrained do you remember the sermon brother Michael preached here some years ago unrestrained generation you see you know we are the unrestrained generation the devil cannot restrain us the devil cannot hinder us if we have a vision and we start on it the devil cannot hind us but now these people here God said they cannot be restrained whatever they have imagined to do they are going to do that was God's testimony and these people's plans was to build a strong and defensible City their plan was to build a massive Tower in the city and that Tower was supposed to reach the heavens and also their plan was to make a name for themselves wow sounded like a big plan right and also their plan was to keep themselves together now there are many many approaches you can have on this Tower of bab but today I want to take one of the unity of purpose there is something that these people had that many Believers don't have there is something that these people had and God testified that they had it many families don't have it many churches don't have it many nations don't have it and that's why they are divided and they fall there is something about Unity of purpose when you have Unity your purpose whatever your vision is whatever you have set out to do it cannot be restrained but the problem that we have is many people do not have Unity or purpose but you see these people's Unity of purpose was not within God's will you know what was God's will I want you to look at Genesis 1: 28 28 I will I shall read it in the Amplified version it says and God blessed them granting them certain Authority and he said to them now are you following me are you following me this side the end there has not hit you so much power I want you to be so that I may preach to you the word don't make me sleep tell your neighbor don't make the pastor to sleep praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen okay thank you brother that that's good yes okay God granted them certain Authority God has granted us certain Authority on this earth now we can do many things but if we are not walking within the authority of God we will never accomplish anything we will walk uncertainly and we will not be prosperous in our endeavors but you see the Bible says God blessed them God gave granted them certain Authority and he said to them be fruitful multiply and fill the Earth F the Earth everyone say fill the Earth so God's purpose was that the people will F the whole but this people's motive was to keep themselves to one place so they can make a name for thems so they can keep themselves together in one place so they can build a massive Tower and they would be strong and defensible but you see what when God looked at that he said this is not my purpose for man immediately came down and changed the whole thing these people were speaking the same language these people had the same speech but you know when God came down you know he changed everything don't ever think you are too powerful that God can't change you you cannot Prosper because of your own power you cannot Prosper because of your own knowledge and wisdom you have to submit yourself to the plan that God has already set for you you do that and you are in the unity of Purpose with others together oh you can accomplish what no one has ever accomplished I believe I am looking at some people here not everyone but I'm looking at some people here that are going to accomplish what no one has ever accomplished I am looking at some people here who will invent things no one has ever invented I am looking at some people here who go to certain Heights in their life amen that no one has ever attained I believe I'm the only me in the world and I believe I have an ability from the authority of God he said go be fruitful multiply the subjugate I am here to do just that I am looking at people that will attain certain Milestones that the world has never seen amen that is that SA the word as long as we are walking in God's will we are more than able tell your neighbor we are more than able I am looking at people who will accomplish things that no one has accomplished in their family hallelujah amen where they say no one buys a kind in our family I'm looking at someone who will accomplish that and will buy a car and everyone in your family will be surprised no one has ever built a home in your family in your family but it is possible for you now think about something in your family that your father failed to do your father's father to do and then many times we begin to think even me I can't I stopped reasoning like that many I started reasoning like this I am a special person the Bible told me that the Bible says you are a royal priesthood you are a peculiar people meaning I am different I am not common I am not I am here in this world to start a new generation which will do exploit hallelujah hallelujah amen I am not just exciting you I am Telling You reality I am Telling You reality if everyone in my family was poor oh they had riches and the riches got Finny look I can begin something new the likes of which none of my family members has ever seen why because I joined another family I am United with another family the family of God and we have another purpose we are united in one purpose there is much I want to share today in a very short time I want I want to be done because of the things I told you we are going to do so that means I have only 53 minutes so give me all your attention and let me try to um keep this time by God's grace amen hallelujah amen F the Earth F the Earth was God's will but this people's motive was not God's will their motive came from someone I know it came from Lucifer what is your motive it either comes from God or from Lucifer are you hearing me this morning let me read for you Lucifer's motive Isaiah 14:12 how thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou has said in thy heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the North I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit the motive of Satan was to go high to to exalt himself higher so he can make a name for himself he wanted to have a kingdom bigger than the one Michael had but you see the kingdom of Satan cannot be bigger than the kingdom of God we are in this world but we have two kingdoms and they all side by side and both of them are pulling on us but because we have a seed of God in us the kingdom of Satan can not fully defeat us we will always overcome we shall always overcome because the seed of God remains in us and you see this the results of the unity this people wanted to they had come together of the at Babel and they had decided to build themselves a tower but because their Unity was not right their purpose was not right God from heaven sent them a spirit which made them change their tongues and they began speaking in unknown tongues until to date has never changed I can call here people who speak 10 different tongues one is speaking another another another anothera another one you know another and I'm still only in Uganda and have not finished and when I go to another country same thing to another country same thing and these people began speaking different tongues everyone was confused because they were not understanding what the other was saying and this this this has had a repeat in our generation you find in churches many churches which claim to have the spirit you find many different people speaking different tongues no one understands what the other one is saying and they don't care because they are confused so what is it it's another B it's another B but we have had a voice come out of my people be not partakers of our sins and that's why where we are when God if when God gives us a language a tongue amen he gives the interpretation why because he doesn't want us to be confused he wants us to understand and to be edified praise the name of the Lord and so these people's motives was wrong but they had one thing the unity of purpose nothing was restrained from them whatever they imagin to do for Satan to pull off his plan for him to pull off his plan in heaven he had to convince the angels to believe in his cause in his purpose can you imagine that Satan himself had a purpose in heaven imagine all of you are angels okay and I'm not sat and then would come and say all of you support me stand with me let us stop this government I want my Throne to be up I want to be high I want to be known I want to make a name for myself so let us do this and he convinced successfully many angels he convinced them in heaven he knew one thing today let us learn something from the way Satan does things because whatever he learned he learned it from God s knew one thing that Unity the power there is a power of unity there's a a great power in unity of purpose because he knew it sat knew it so much that he dared God he he dared God the creator of Heaven and Earth you know daring him is like a no you know like someone who would come like if if you were a soldier imagine sat he was a creation but he came and and he dared God himself and he said I want to take that the throne where you are sitting what did he trust you see he knew one thing if I can get most of the angels to stand with me and we agree together then shall accomplish what we want so there is two cases we have seen so far there is one case the one of of the Tower of Babel they had Unity of and they wanted to build a tower and they wanted to make themselves a great name and they wanted to be known and to be secure wanted to be in one place and powerful and God said they were going to accomplish it but there is another group of people these were also angels in heaven and they were you know at first you know they were all submitting to God but together sat Lucifer with the demons with all the Angels they agreed to top the government in heaven now let me tell you this in both these scenarios they were going to accomplish it the only thing that stopped it is God I don't know whether someone is getting the Revelation yet when there is unity of purpose whatever you have set out to do whatever you have imagined to do it will be finished it will be done it will be accomplished the only Satan himself can stop it the only thing that can stop it is God at the Tower of Babel it was God who stopped it if God had not stopped it today we would have a great power B speaking the same language and and you know man would make himself a kingdom different from what God envisioned for you but you see God could not allow it his will had to be done and he came and confused all of them and Lucifer he would have taken over Heaven he had the power why because of the unity of all the demons all the Angels which which were turned to Demons because the they were United with him they were agreeing with everything he was saying imagine it looked like God is defeated because most of the Angels had bowed most of the Angels had bowed that's why we sing a you are God from beginning to the end there's no place for argument you are God by yourself because listen there is nothing that can defeat the word of God there is nothing can defeat the word of God the word of God will always take the preeminence that's why for me as long as I set to do something and I know I am right standing on the word I don't fear no evil I don't fear nothing because I know God is with me but you see there is the power in unity of purpose can you read matthew8 Matthew 18 19 and I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them did someone get that now you have heard it but I want you to now take it for yourself if two of you shall agree on us as touching anything that they shall ask if two shall agree as about anything on Earth and they ask it it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven now I want you to see this you know a brother came and told me some came you know even if you want a male child this scripture will work amen I said are you sure and he gave me his testimony I had three girls she said brother do you need a son I said yes I said I need more than a son I need several Sons he said well I tell you what to do one brother gave me a scripture I said is it a new scripture that is not in the Bible he said no it is in the Bible he read it to me he said you see this is the scripture I had children I had children but I did not have a male child and I needed God to provide for me a male child and so he said I met a brother who told me he used this scripture and it worked for him so he said I also did the same thing he did and I told him so what did you do he said he told me that he held hands with his wife and together with his wife they agreed that God will give them a wife God would give them a child a male child and so we they prayed oh God give us a male child and God answered them and I told him God answered them did he answer you also he said yes after very very very many years God answered me and I have my son I said amen in my heart I was like I will also try it children come from God so if you listening to me and you bar children come from God children come from God and I held hands with my wife I said God give us a male child some people when you are praying your prayers are not very clear so even God is not sure how to answer them you see oh God we want a child maybe a male one maybe okay whatever you want that prayer God will never answer because you're not sure about what you want you are not sure about what you are amen but you you have to be sure about what you want when you come before God God I need a white car God I need a car like this like this like this specify even even the engine how much fuel consumption you know how many c 7 2 3 4 what do you want be specific on your request amen if you are married you come together with your wife or with your husband that's why agreement is very very important and unity is very very important divided we fall United We Stand I'm trying to show you the power of unity and when you have Unity of purpose in everything you set out to do it can never be restrained you can never be restrained you begin praying oh God we want Le be specific don't tell him just land you give us what do you want even if it is a plot even if it is 50 by 50 even if you don't have faith you have to know what you want what do you want you specify it if you you you you know you feel you prayed and it does not worked let me give you some medicine today pick a brother or a sister if you're a sister tell them what you desire your burden to them and then you tell them look I want you to join with me in prayer over this matter and then you go together in prayer Unity of purpose every prayer you pray there God will answer two of you shall agree as touching anything can you tell your neighbor anything anything if you want healing you can agree with somebody Hallelujah am if you want a car you can agree with somebody if you need money if you need a job whatever you need come on someone you can agree with someone and say let us agree and pray and believe that God is going to do this for us the power of unity of purpose for where two or three are gathered together in my name I am there I am in the middle even God knows church is not one person church is two people and more two people and more so you who is staying at home saying I read my Bible I don't need to go to church sorry you are on your own you are there but when people are here in church this one saying amen saying amen saying amen all of us together amen we are uniting in purpose and there is a power behind that amen 2 Corinthians 131 this is the third time I'm coming to you says in the mouth of two shall every word be established two or three Witnesses two or three you see the unity of purpose praise the name of the Lord and the devil knows that's why has always just for Unity he has always wanted Unity he has always been promoting it and I want to show you here in the message Oneness uh brother bam says something about the Council of churches he says mandas it builds another Tower of Babel what does he do look in this world Council of churches now the Anglican the Roman Catholic the Methodist the resian the Pentecostals and all of them United together Christian Science and many of the Cs that deny the Virgin birth they deny the duty of Jesus they make God three people they try to worship three gods they deny the Virgin birth some of them deny the blood some of them deny his miracles all of them do nearly they try to unite such as as that together how can you do it it's a man-made Tower it will fall like B any manade idea will fall this people United together one mind one Unity of purose but God could not let it stand because it was a manmade idea but God will let any purpose stand if it isn't grounded in the word and these denominations by the way they have all come together in a council of churches but God said not by power not by mind but by my spirit say the Lord that is how I will unite my church The Church of God is not going to be United by denomination not by organization not by education not by theologians but by my spirit say the Lord I will bring my ship together do you know we are here inong we preach the Holy Ghost on Fire there are believers somewhere else there are believers somewhere else they believer somewhere else and all of them are pushing for the same thing talk about the unity of purpose you know at the fer of the brother they all called us and they said all the Believers come there were more than 2,000 people and the others remained in in the tents the Muslims the anglicans the Orthodox pente and the Believers all came together which song were we singing was it when they redeemed redeemed our have to Proclaim it was it the song and so we all came together and the brother started the song I enjoyed it I enjoyed it you know they were singing in Swahili but I joined in and oh it was just so lovely all the Believers from everywhere from every Parts in Kenya from Mombasa from whatever from Uganda and we were all there United singing [Music] [Music] beautiful you know I started thinking is how it shall be when we cross over I started thinking this brother because I knew him he must have already joined the choire over the other side they are all United amen together not different idea no different thoughts or dogmas or Creeds or ideas of organization they only had one thing one Spirit by one Spirit we are all baptized into the body singing one language speaking the same word we are going to be over there and we are going to sing the same song over there we are going to Rejoice over there people from every country on Earth imagine Russians will be there you know I have this pastor friend of mine in Russia he believes and preaches this message I've told him brother come and preach to us he said I need to First perfect my English you know just thinking in heaven we will all speak the same language here we are speaking the same language of the word you know he's speaking Russian but if it was to be interpreted everything is the same as you believe this entire message is not oh my God help you to get it amen it's not just a church it listen it is more than a religion it is more than a church it is more than a denomination more than an organization what is this it is the Holy Ghost and power and all believers all over the world we are united in one purpose one Spirit we are baptized into it by the power of the Holy Ghost the moment you are sealed by the Holy Ghost you are ready for the Rapture you are ready for the Rapture I don't know how many are here for the Rapture but you see as many as are baptized by one Spirit they are all ready and he says oh my when he does what happens and his son will bear record on the same his signs will bear record on the same yes that's how Israel could say before they got mixed up with Moab there was a pill of fire over them what will he do he will bear a record the same kind of record but after they got disassociated separ their Oneness between them and God and they got in with Moab and them the victory all failed they stayed in the wilderness for 40 more years till God raised up another group to go over hey and complete his plan God will has a plan and his plan will never fail Hallelujah God uses men to accomplish his plan but when a man sleeps away from the plan God does not sleep away from the plan I see a man called sa we think people chose soul it was God who chose he he told the man of God go and anoint sa was going about his business and he gave him a sign he said you know when the spirit of God comes upon him when he comes among the prophet the son of the prophets he will begin prophesying like them and that will be a son that is chosen God chose not the people and soul was supposed to follow God's plan but time came when s's had became hty he became disobedient he became proud and God said no problem so you think you are the only one it's all right I have a little David somewhere I have a little Shepherd boy are you hearing me church I have a little Shepherd boy somewhere my purpose must be a compl and you know he went and C A little sheer even the prophet himself did not believe that it was it was David he could not believe it the boy looked Rudy he bad he looked unkempt who looks like David here I would give an exle all of you look like do I have David here here oh my brother Jo why are you pointing at someone are you not David but Elijah come up here hallelujah hallelujah amen oh little David God bless you amen and I want you to imagine who is sold [Laughter] here praise the name of the Lord you know I'm sure he was looking like this man how old are you Elijah are you 17 exactly I thought as much he might have been around 15 17 there and you see you know David was a a small boy his hair was UNT D you have ComEd very well today but you know his was unkempt and he all sh and his clothes were big on him and and you know you remember some you remember Saul gave him a big it was big on him he couldn't wear it he only was experienced with sheep but you know as Soul was proud [Music] as he was proud thinking that he the man of God God s did not know are you hearing me church that God is only interested in his right purpose and so you know David was there and you know the man of God looked at all the other children God kept on saying no no no no no no until Le David showed up and God said yes I'm sure even when the man of God was going to anoint him he was could he really be the one and he finally anointed him and Little David was just there smiling like this young man saying what is happening to me in other words the man of God told him congratulations you are a king from today God is going to use you from today I'm not just using you as an example this as a Rema word for you God is going to use you from today Hallelujah and God anointed a man and Saul was still jumping up and down I am the man of God I'm the man of God but listen there's something I was coming to God is only looking at his purpose and God has not run out of men and right from that time when David disobeyed when David when Saul disobeyed you know God anointed David and sa knew nothing about it the time he knew about it he wanted to kill the boy but remember you cannot be killed until the purpose has been you cannot die until his purpose is accomplished can you PR over your life and say I shall leave to declare the purpose of God hallelujah and right there Soul was jumping up and down but God had a king sa was disobeying God had a king are you hearing me this morning Saul was playing around but God had a king and I want to tell you Church whatever God has called you to do do it with diligence because God has a little David somewhere if you are the one sweeping the church don't begin playing around God want someone else who will do it let me help them to S the church you are not helping anyone sweep the church because God has called you to do and there is a blessing behind it way everything you do for God has a blessing behind it and if you play round God will anoint a little David oh God may you help me may you not anoint my little David help me to be diligent help me to be committed help me to be surrendered now look when God brings a church together with his Spirit they will have signs and of the Living God among them what kind of signs when God separated Israel from Egypt God gave Moses and Israel a sign of a pill of fire and he gave them a prophet when he separed Abraham from lot there was an angel to an angel came to him that could design the thoughts and intents of the heart and I read a quote here that brother bam was speaking about the foolish virgins you see he says as um he say he was talking about the foolish V virgins and he says the Council of churches is nothing else in the world but a star of the foolish virgin okay you have to interpret get the correct the correct interpretation here star not with a but with I star of the foolish virgin you know the foolish virgins are the ones that are not going to go in the rapture the foolish virgins they are going to remain behind they will miss the Rapture do I have some fo virgins here today they will miss the Rapture but the wise virgins will go the and he said the counc of churches we have a counc of churches called The World Council of churches even here in Uganda we have c those churches they unite together all the denominations and I think they called ecumenical movement ecumenical council all of them come together for what reason for love for Unity solidity what else you know and so they unite together and um you know they they begin to say we are the voice of religion in the country and the Catholic church is not a member of the World Council of churches but the Catholic Church the the the leader of the World Council of churches he reports occasionally to the uh to the pope of R and you know you would wonder why would the leader of the Council of churches report the pope of Rome when the Catholic church is not a member of the of the Council of churches we are preparing ourself for the One World Government one world religion and the C of of the churches they all unite under they say we don't believe in the same Doctrine but we should agree to work together what is that you think that is a good thing I surprise you by doing that the people are getting the mark of the beast the Bible says they get it by the right hand fellow by the forehead Doctrine intellect people are going to get the back of the beast in two ways one by being in the wrong fellowships two by believing the wrong doctrines and the Council of churches is a star of the foolish virgins so all those who are joining the Council of churches those systems those organiz those religions they are actually preparing the foolish virgin for the tribulation but I'm so glad I have a message that has called me out of the denomination I am not a member of The ecumenical move we will never be a member we are not about to be a member that is why even this message is not known anywhere by the way did you know that they'll ask you what is your religion no one knows our religion because we cannot Unite with them to unite with them we have to be a denomination but we are not one so we can never Unite with them that's why we even have different Church names don't have a headquarter yes you you may find one Church name maybe in a few places and another one and another one and another one depending on who started those churches but you see all the Believers all over the world what is our name we have no name think of it the Roman Catholic church is called the Roman Catholic Church all over the world the angan church is called all over the world but the message church is not a denomination it is a revelation of the word it's a restoration back to the apostles Doctrine we have one Unity of purpose we are restored back again our purpose is the message the word the Holy Ghost and that's we cannot be part of the Council of churches the Council of churches is another Bible today but I'm so glad you know there's a song that says oh I'm so glad he found me with his arms he bound and he led me into this message and now I'm one of his own and oh what Joy of knowing you know what he led me into this message he brought he he he set my feet on the Rock to stay we have not come here or we don't gather here to form another denomination and that's why I'm so sorry for people who come to this message and remain siners you come to the message church and you remain going to fornication the angel of the Lord is watching and you know you you are not filled with the Holy Ghost that means you are not yet filled with the Holy Ghost you are in the message church you've not overcome the world but you know those who shall overcome the world shall sit with him on his throne this message has come to bring us into one purpose of Overcomers we are the Overcomers in this generation we are the ones in the true unity in the message as the ego stirreth up her nest he says my Ministry is a Ministry trying to unite the bride of Christ together not unite denominations to one denomination but unite brothers and sisters as one group of people one in purose one in heart one in unity to see the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so in other words this message is not uniting one denomination into one it is uniting people brothers and sisters the body of Christ together that's why we don't have a headquarter these details are very important for those who are new to the message we don't have a headquarter our headquarter is the word our Archbishop is Jesus Christ we are all United under that one message we are all corrected by that one message when someone does a mistake someone people have come up and have asked me how do you then correct erant ministers you see you correct ER ministers by the word not by the discipline of the organization you saw what happened to the Archbishop here of one of the churches they told they disciplined him but you see the denomination disciplined him and so they are they also ask us how can we discipl our ministers chur you you are the church and when you receive this word you have a right to walk away from me if I'm not preaching the truth and where will you go there are many tens of millions of preachers who are preaching this message even here Ina in every city in Uganda there are tens of thousands of them what I'm trying to show you church God is Not bankrupt of men he will use of women he will use but he's only looking for people who have a thirst and hunger for the world that's why we should never compromise amen we should never compromise praise the name of the Lord amen now Psalms 1331 says behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity you see does this mean we will always agree on everything it simply means as Believers we unite around the word right here I want to correct some people many times when a person doesn't agree with another on just some little thing okay how many here believe that Jesus is coming to take us in the Rapture lift up your hand if you believe it okay how many here say he will come on a white horse lift up your lift up your hand okay okay how many here say he will come on the clouds okay okay and those of you who have not lifted up how do you believe you will come you have other opinions so you see our Revelation is different but we all believe in the Rapture and someone comes up and says no how many believe we are going to have a a tribulation lift up your hand how many believe here how many believe we are going to have a tribulation now how many believe it's going to be seven years okay how many believe it's going to be 3 years and a half okay now you see different understanding how many believe the bride will through the tribulation you see we all believe that bride will not go through the tribulation but depending on which church you came from of course if you came from this church you know the tribulation three years and a half but if you had another Pastor who T you different your tribulation is going to be seven years but I don't care you are my brother there's going to be a tribulation and both of us believe we are not going to be a part of it Hallelujah am so what am I trying to say the unity of of purpose it means we are united around the world with all other believers talking about I'm not talking about only this church I'm talking about all other believers all over the world we are united around the world someone who little Revelation on the word that is a little different from what I have I don't care about it they are my brother and they are my sister and that's why we should always Unite with other believers we should never get indifferent we get some kind of spirit around us to feel and believe we are the only right group do you know that there are many groups like that and I believe we are the only right one some of them even say for us we are eagles for them they're chicken Believers of the message will say that and you find a pastor on the pull pit say for us we are the Eagles for them they the chicken he's not talking the denominations he's talking about other message believers who don't have the Revelation that he has he feels he has a special Revelation listen we have no special revelation we only have the message of the hour period period That's What We Believe and every brother who believes it is our brother every sister who believes it is our sister do you believe that church that's why in this church I want to employer you I want to instruct you you should never ever disfellowship other [Applause] believers they our brothers it doesn't matter what their Church name is what what belies I don't care what I don't care what name as long as they believe the message they are our brothers as long as they believe in one God they are our brothers as long as they believe in the Resurrection The rupture they our brothers as long as they believe in the baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ they are our brothers they believe in Malachi 4 they are our brothers you know they believe in all the Mysteries the Seven Seals the right Ministry the working of the of the gifts in the body they our brothers but where they got denominational they go into Creeds and dogmas they go into clanning themselves and try you know going into for us we are this tribe for the others we are this tribe you know for us we see no we we don't associate with that we have a message and the message is a perfect revelation of the word and we as Believers we unite around this message praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord amen now there's a I have a a very um a a short reading here that I read that I felt is very significant and I must um read for you before I I conclude um it says um this was written by a man called Randy and he was giving a little comments on the book of nemiah and um I want you to follow this through with me have we received that kind of vision from God himself yes but before I share his vision that should ultimately bring Unity let's look at a few biblical principles on Vision maybe maybe because this is a long reading maybe I can read it without interpretation can anybody hear English separately okay so let me just read it in English amen praise the Lord amen okay it says one of the best places to look is the book of Nehemiah Nehemiah is among other things a great leadership manual it teaches strategy management and people skills it is a book on teamwork possibly most of all it shows a comparing vision and a Divine and a Divine communication of fruition the setting for the book of Nehemiah takes place roughly 500 years before the time of Christ after the Babylonian captivity as a result of the decree of Cyrus the Jews were allowed to return to their Homeland only to find the city of Jerusalem in Ruins we are introduced to Nehemiah as the cup Bearer and I and I I pray that some of you will go and read the book of Nehemiah after this as the cup bearer nemiah was a cup Bearer to the king excuse me as a high position in the Royal Court in the 20th year of the king's Reign One of nehemiah's Brothers who had been living in Judah visits him in Susa nemiah asks about the surviving captive Jews about Jerusalem the answer which bothered him greatly was survivers were in great distress and the wall of Jerusalem was broken down and this bth a passion for a compelling Vision now I want you to see Nehemiah was a prophet nemiah was you know in captivity like the rest of the Jews and here for very many years they were not in Jerusalem and here his brother came and told him about what was happening he told him how the wall was broken he told him how you know the survivors were in great distress be you know received a burden and received a vision to of rebuilding the Temple of rebuilding Jerusalem but before we okay let me continue here and we see principles I want to show you tonight before I I complete this sermon the principles of a compelling Vision one the first bibical principle just listen of a compelling Vision number one it starts with God and is received through prayer the first thing Nehemiah did after hearing about the state of Jerusalem was fall on his face before God and pray nine times in the first year in the first chapter of Nehemiah the word pray or prayer is used it has been said nothing significant for God ever happens apart from prayer this must be where any Vision begins God spoke to Nehemiah in that in that still Small Voice and assured him of what what could and should be done he knew the walls needed rebuilding this wasn't just a dream Nehemiah dreamed of it wasn't even his idea this was the vision given to him by God today it is so easy to dream up big plans for God and then ask him to bless them this is backwards our vision whether for our family our church our fellowship or ourselves must begin with a complete dependence on God and on commitment to listen to him I want to show you something about Vision you the Bible says where there is no vision the people perish listen Church my time is up but I want you to give me 20 more minutes I I wrap up I said 20 listen are you listening ask your neighbor are you listening we are talking about Vision here Vision without it no matter what you are talking about it will fail let it be a church a church without Vision it fails a family without Vision a family a family families it fails fellowships they fail anything we are talking about there must be vision driving it and we see here that one of the principles of a compelling vision is a true Vision starts in prayer with God you know when you go in prayer some Believers the problem Believers don't want to pray we don't want to pray and by the way if you live a life where you never pray you will always be disturbed in things of life but when you put yourself to a life of prayer God will give you Vision before this year ends just be in prayer that's why we even do that overnight of prayer so we can get vision for the next year you know whatever face you reach out and you need to hear from God you go in prayer so nemiah went in prayer and you know God revealed to him what he must do God showed him what he must do he became sad which was a taboo before the king to be sad the second principle of a compelling Vision it goes through God is appointed leader that's the second principle now okay I'll I I'll read this where's brother Elijah okay come and help the brother come and help the brother to interpret I know I you will interpret for about 15 minutes this is I Little David today praise the Lord okay let me just read this and then he will interpret when I'm speaking okay the second principle listen just listen Church listen to these things very important the second principle of a comparing Vision it goes through God's appointed leader Nehemiah completely accepted and believed in the vision given to him by God are you listening to me to the point he was willing to put his life on the line in chapter two Nehemiah is serving the king and the King notices he has a sad countenance and questions him this terrified Nehemiah because it was a violation of the law to be sad in the king's presence Nehemiah confronts his fear and tells the king the vision God gave him amen okay don't hear what don't see how how small my David is just listen to what he's going to be speaking praise the name of the Lord just all right okay just I was going to tell you to use a higher voice praise the name of the Lord I want you to see something Church praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord a second principle yes uh a vision is it has to go through God's appointed leader God you know I was um I was speaking with the pastor I told you and he told me this he said that U a church just like you see dvf here a church is not just the people a church is the vision of the person that God has chosen to use are you hearing me if for example brother um you know brother Dixon here goes to with a button with a vision to go and start something there you know the ministry the ministry there will not be the building will not be the chairs will not be the musicians the ministry there will be brother Dix you understand is the man that God has chosen to use there and he brings that vision and he uses this man to bring it to the people praise the name of the Lord now listen okay just listen to this God God has always used I thought these are very words of great words of wisdom and I wanted you to listen to it now God has always used these people to accomplish great things one remarkable aspect of the book of Nehemiah is there are no Miracles involved if you have ever seen a book with no Miracles is the book of Nehemiah there are no Miracles involved here we are only seeing a man with a burden for something to happen he's going to stop at nothing until it happens there are no Angelic host coming down to help it is just God's man serving God's people a god sized compelling Vision however is too great for just one person there is no way nemiah could have accomplished it by himself nemiah needed people to accomplish a vision what I'm speaking on here is very foundational and I'm I'm going to first nail it down properly in the next minutes I asked listen when nemiah he was serving the king he was the one holding the cup of the king you know if you are the one holding the cup of the king you always had to be happy like that brother is smiling you always have to be happy so it was not allowed to be S are we in the presence of the king here who is Happy neiah had to be happy but when he was told by his brother about what is happening in Jerusalem became sad so he became like this so when the king looked at him said what what is happen to neiah in other words do you want to die how can you be sad in my presence and then he explained he said my people are dying I need to go back allow me let me go back and do something I want to do something for my people I want to do something for my people you know I was just laying I was just seeing a brother laying in the [Music] coffee I knew him to be a very lovely brother humble brother but you see God had used him he built churches he helped the brothers he help the ministers he stood for this message talking about a high profile person in the government but he did a lot but you see the Bible says our works the works of of those who believe they go before them and now he's he's standing before God and the only thing that he can point out the only thing he can point out is what he did for the Lord and for the work of God but you see also he was standing serving the king but in his heart said no this is not enough I have to go back and serve my people he was sad because of that by the way to be sad before the king to be sad before the King was risking his life the king would just say you kill that he he risked his life all for what because of the vision he had received but if a vision is big if a vision is from God if a vision is great it cannot be accomplished by one person God will always have a leader he will choose and he will say I want to use you but not only you he will use you but he will give you many many amen hallelujah and every church ministry is like that and every family is like that you know when when when you a man and have a big Vision like brother Alan here you have dreams and vision things you have God has revealed to you you have to accomplish in this life he now begins to give you other people to support you he now begins to bring Marine he now begins to bring children you children don't come only for you to bust on they come to move the vision they come to move the vision that God has given you you understand that's why if someone has no children it's a bad thing it is good to have children it is good for a father to have children you believe that every parent who has children he's always very happy when he just looks at his child I always hear my mother I'm sorry talk about you you know when she's talking to her friends she begins talking about her children oh this one is doing that oh this one is doing that and until now after she has talked about them she begins to feel good now because she has children you understand so this come to support your vision even Ministry Ministry cannot be done by one man when God calls Moses he gives the vision to Moses listen Vision doesn't come to many people at the same time God chooses a leader one man just like in our generation he chose one man one man one manth one man in the hands of God go and study your history books there is no man in this generation listen for the last 50 years whose Ministry canot be Tred back to William Bram I'll show you an example here just in our country there is a man many God has used I don't look at their bad side I look at what they have accomplished you can look at Pastor Kay for example he's done a great work in this country in his own rights so we see that uh he claims T osbor is his spiritual father have you heard about a man called Bishop Bon how many have heard of it he claims also his spiritual father is Osborne did you know that now T Osborne gave his testimony Tom Osborne so we call him t l Osborne you need to read more oror was a man that went to India and he went with his wife to to heing Crusades and all these things preach the gospel and they failed they told them you can you demonstrate this thing you're telling us can God heal us these people who have and they failed to perform one Miracle fa flat and his ministry was coming to one end he came back to America defeated until he his wife told him about and they sat in the tent of brother bham and they saw the Miracles life they saw the feet of of a child becoming longer they saw close eyes becoming normal said what he said no he went a prayer closet he said if this God have seen the god of William Bram is the god of the Bible I also want to be able to perform Miracles he prayed until God gave it to him and he came here to you guys he went all over the world so is all robots and others they all saided with William Bram many of you did not know that William Bram was a man that God gave the vision in our generation for the bright [Music] know the vision of this generation hallelujah amen so a God sized comparing Vision if a vision is a big Vision if it's from God it is too great for just one person just like in a local church if God has given me the vision for you know someone brother sh canot also come and say I also have the vision for the church that's confusion Brother Martin cannot come and say you know I'm a minister here Pastor is not doing things correctly I also have the vision for things to be done this way we are going to get confusion we have to be led by a God given Vision but you see it cannot be done by one person okay listen a leader must be willing to stand alone but he or she also realizes that a compelling vision gets others involved after nemiah had been in Jerusalem for 3 days if evaluating the situation he gathered everyone together he gave a starring challenge to the citizens of Jerusalem sharing his vision immediately the people responded and you know what the people said they said let us rise up and behold and they began the good work the entire third chapter gives a detailed worker plan of where now listen where each family was involved in rebuilding the wall when when nemiah went and told the people and he told them the vision that God had given him everyone called The Vision let us build are you hearing me I'm not preaching to dvf now whoever is streaming and is not part of the ministry sorry let us build let us build are you hearing people said let us build the vision be gave the vision of the work that God had given him and then the people responded let us build all of together all of them together as one group now there's something I wanted to show you here he says each family each person was involved in the rebuilding of the wall everyone was included from the strongest to the weakest from the richest to the poorest from the most influential to the least influential it is almost comical reading through vers 8 where it states a man named there's a man called uz and a man named Ania where they were working besides each other listen but was a rough and tough gold smith yes Han's occupation was a manufacturer of perfumes I want you to see all these people they were working together you have the one who is making perfumes is working side by side by with a goldi we don't know gold smith yes now you see these people are working side by side you find someone who is working in media Department yes media department and another musician but they are working side by side you find an interpreter with a sweeper of the church they are working inside my side you find a rich one and and a poor one they working side by side I'm trying to show you Church a vision for example here we have this collection of funds for the church for the land of the church it is not my land it is not your land either it is our land it is a common goal it's a common Vision where did we get the vision from from the Lord whose work is it God's work now it is not for me as a person I cannot do it alone I need help men and women who will catch the vision said me I will do this part you know every Church look at each church I don't care whether they Believers or not that has been successful they have had people who C the vision catching the vision yes catching the vision tell your neighbor catch the vision catch the vision what can you do what can you do from the richest to the poorest neiah gathered all of them I last time I read for you about ants I think I don't know whether it's during summer they work yes I know in ug don't have summer and winter and all those things but it's fine during summer they work they work they work they work and they build and they GA food they do everything during winter they begin eating now if you are one of the ants and you never work during summer you are not allowed to eat during winter you go and read it it is the truth on ants how much more We the People the Believers of this message and you are part of the church but you are are waiting to be forced and be begged and be parted on the back come let's pray it is a very risky thing you've not caught the vision you've not caught the vision if you are going to cast a compelling Vision it must be one that gets everyone involved everyone must be involved a church must include the older members the younger members the spiritually mature the new Christians even the new Believers not only the older ones everyone must be a part of the vision everyone must be a part of it you know even the children parents you must teach your children you know what is a vision a vision cannot be accomplished by one person but together we can do it in Rec time we can accomplish what no one has ever done you see we need men who have Vision who have CAU the vision who understand what is going on praise the name of the Lord and you you are an adult and I've been because I've been hearing the group team leaders look look let me say this our vision in this church is not to build big churches and uh you know get a name for ourselves our vision is to preach the message to take the message everywhere but how can we take the message everywhere when we don't even have a home when they kicking us out parent go parent or go if we are claiming we are preaching the gospel we must catch the vision get land build a church if the Lord is coming in 20 years you will find when we are finished if he's coming in one year you will find when we trying a vision that we have it's a vision that we have it's a vision it is a vision it is a vision we must do this thing it must be done you know this this writer said even if the one who has received the vision stands alone he will is ready to do it to do it I'm ready to do it but how many will do it with me how many will catch it we have a message unlike any other denomination we have a vision to run with this message we we should grow we should come out from being called and being pushed and to the extent someone has to push you to even to come to church these days you're not coming I will come Pastor it's all right you've not caught the vision I remember when we were young people we used to be so much on fire come very early in the morning you you sweep the church you clean the chairs you clean the pulpit you look everywhere is everything fine and then you begin song reading but our younger people here I see them arriving many times late what are you doing in this Vision what are you doing in the work that we are doing what is your part that you playing you must catch the vision you as an individual and lastly every Vision will be OPP you know many many people people many times people want to do things that are not opposed when you do something and everybody likes it you are happy about you do something and now one it you know I would say this I was talking with Pastor Gideon uh as we were coming down back to Uganda and I told him say Pastor if you counted all the churches of the message that in Uganda and say let us uh ask each of the members to collect a sum of [Music] money and within a year we counted we can be able to get maybe 1.2 billion shs think about it brother Andre and with all these churches without even buildings without even land like us renting they 50 here 100 here 200 and we we many churches res to begging from abroad what I'm saying we have more than we need I'm delivering my heart to you this morning we have more than we need we have more than we need but we don't we've not caught the vision that's the only problem okay if we brought that proposal do you think people will buy it how many churches will buy it it is easier for them to write in Canada to write in America right inmany let us get help us help our poor ones who are the poor ones we are not poor no we are not poor we are only not catching the vision many of you younger people you are now in Holiday what are you doing you sleep you eat you sleep again you eat you sleep again you are lazy La go out find a job this is from a past I told you find a job support the Vision support the work of God support the work of God the reason why we preach the gospel is because we are conv the gospel is true period this message is the truth let me tell you nothing is going to stop it we are going to take it everywhere nothing will stop it but the need is great but we have to cat the vision you yourself you have to ask yourself what can I do what can I do we have books we are printing here Brethren from other continents have to send money for printing it is a shame on us as Believers in ug translation they have S money to support translators and when they stop the translation stop let me ask you a question who benefits from the translations is it not ugandans is it not ugandans why then are ugandans not able to support the who is poor raise up your hand I'll pray for you the demon of poverty up your no one is poor here no one is poor and let me tell you you will never have all that you need for everything we walk by faith God provides for the journey as we move but the work of God should be number one everything you are doing but but what happens we don't have the unity of purpose yes it is not there that's all we need you need we need to be United in purpose United let us all do this let us all do this this is the right thing to do let us all do it if it's a prayer meeting let us all go if it's collecting for supporting our work let us all do it if for whatever we have to do let's do it why because we are given a commission as we all stand on and we let us read Matthew 28 vers um 19 go you there teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have Commit commanded you and L I Am With You Always even until the end of the world so he said we should go and teach All Nations we should make in other we should make disciples of all the as musicians come of all the nations we should take the gospel to All Nations All Nations All Nations I want it to come to your knowledge All Nations All Nations All Nations so it is a must for us to take whose responsibility is it he that has believed so I know people would say oh we have not even finished collecting for our church land now we are very busy running to start another fellowship somewhere another we will a thousand of them the work we are given is to go to All Nations but you see this Vision that we have we cannot do it alone I cannot do it alone we need people to cat the vision and ask yourself a question what can I do as you bow your heads Lord Jesus you have given us a great burden in our hearts you've called us out of the denominations not to start another religion but you have called us to take this gospel to all the nations but the question is what can we do maybe someone will be able to pray maybe someone can wait upon the Lord and pray for the work of God pray for the pastors the Min pray for the musicians maybe someone will say I can do that I can do this everyone according to their abilities and doing it with all their hearts knowing that the day is f running out Christ is about to come back again we have little time left we need to consecrate ourselves more yield ourself more allow you to use us more father I pray for someone here today that in their hearts they have a desire for you to use them Lord I pray that you will give leadership you'll give direction that your grace will undertake for them you will give them ability you'll give them strength that they will be able to know your will they will be able to go in prayer because that is where we find the vision what can I do if everyone just go in prayer and ask the Lord what can I do have I done my best is there not more that I can do for the Lord can't I give of my resources more than I have given my time in prayer can I uh evangelize and witness to [Music] someone can I bring a friend tell them that there is Honey in the Rock what can I do maybe some of you
