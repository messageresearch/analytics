preached here at church on Sunday really this is the service where I'm going to bring in more content and so on Sunday it was just an introduction so I'm speaking on a subject Barry me here and [Music] is the oldest book in the Bible even before Genesis the Patriarchs knew that job knew where the Redeemer would stand and as I'll read you shortly jobs that are for said because job was at a time when his body was almost being finished by worms [Music] he was terribly ill and he knew that death was eminent in that condition receive the Revelation and he said I know my redeemer lives a redeemer is the one that redeems somebody or something that has left its first estate and Fallen away foreign [Music] or at the place or about the place where the Redeemer was going to start did you know that Jesus died and was buried in the promised land yeah we know that that was actually directly speaking about Jesus Jesus was the seed yesterday yes that was he was the Royal Sea yeah yes he was not just speaking about uh you know Isaac because Isaac was the natural seed but he was speaking about the Royal seats and do you know that spiritual city was Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ yes Christian also had other seeds after him foreign [Music] praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah Nina and when he went to these people Ibrahimovic the man they told him oh that piece of land we can give it to you for free that's right and he asked them and he said I will not take anything he said how much is the life it's only worth 400 seconds I am going to pay not necessarily never the last one that this land is it it is worth your name is because I want to bury my family are you hearing me I am buying a barring place foreign [Music] and Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto memory and unto the city of ABBA which is Hebron where Abraham and Isaac Sir John and the days of Isaac were 104 school years and Isaac gave up The Ghost and died and was gathered unto his people being old and full of days and his sons issao and Jacob buried him for [Music] foreign foreign [Music] we see that Abraham Ibrahim had a natural scene and this seed was part of the promise Abraham gave birth to Isaac and Isaac gave birth to Jacobs and now when Isaac was old the Bible says he died and you know he was old and full of days and his sons they buried him in that same same place are you hearing me foreign now let us go to Genesis 32 47. verse 28 to 31. and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years so the whole age of Jacob was 140 and seven years and the time Drew Naya that Israel must die and he called his son Joseph and said unto him if now I have found Grace in thy sight put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me but me not I pray thee in Egypt but I will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in the in their budding place and he said I will do as thou has said and his and and he says swear unto me and he swear unto him and Israel bowed himself upon the beds the bed's head Sarah [Music] foreign he felt like I'm foreign commissary [Applause] Mississippi don't bother me in cigarettes don't bother me the last of the Flesh of the eyes I have a burning place a lot of preachers and if you don't have Christ foreign [Music] foreign foreign Genesis 50 24 and Joseph said unto his Brethren I die and I will surely visit you and bring you out of this land and rather and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land and to the land which is which he he swear to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and he shall carry up my bones from hands and Joseph died being 110 years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt [Music] where are you fat iguez this is praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen oh my I said hallelujah hallelujah I wanted to follow this story so Jacob died and Joseph had promised Jacob yes and now Joseph also kindness of reach the time when his life was going it was 110 years old but he did not forget the promise let me tell you brothers and sisters you should never forget the promise don't forget the promise you should not be like the people of the world in the world we have a short life because we are going to die no my death is not our final place I have a promise the promise of the Resurrection The Promise us we shall be caught up foreign foreign [Music] hmm you up my bones and and therefore and he he shall carry up my bones from him he said to them you have had my prophecies as long as he's doing it to his children this man died in faith [Applause] the same thing foreign [Applause] hallelujah amen if you can't walk dad is going to visit you I said you guys

visit and he will take you to a land of Joy hallelujah hallelujah foreign he said don't leave me here and they swear to him and so after he died and then they kept him in a coffin somewhere the heart is Faith in them God is going to visit us in their houses but they did not know before they had two dead bodies that this is the sign we are going for a resurrection and this is another sign that we are not dying in Egypt [Applause] hallelujah amen Joseph died in the face yes God sends him with a message it's time will be God foreign I need the messages come oh with the message let's go home it is time Hallelujah for us to be buried in our right footage hallelujah amen when they left Egypt throughout the days foreign foreign [Music] that's the only reason why you can die and those people who died in the wilderness I doubt whether they were carried um the automatically what out of the promise if you complain no you get it if you're not satisfied with foreign [Music] and here he says when as Moses was taking them out Moses started out the Holy Spirit spoke to him and he said Moses you are forgetting something and he says go down and get the bones of Joseph Moses wrapped them up the pill of fire but you're leading him on the promised them by the side of Isaac and Jacob they know there was coming the first fruits of them that slept they know there was coming a resurrection one of them days foreign foreign and he continues and says that job said I know my redeemers and at the last day he will stand upon the Earth and they know that job had an idea where he was going to stand [Music] so he said Hallelujah man so I said they wanted to be with Joseph with a job they buried right around there in Palestine Palestine because that was the promised land and they know the resurrection wasn't going to be in Egypt was it going to be in Europe it wasn't going to be somewhere else it wasn't going to be in Uganda he wasn't going to be in this course it wasn't going to be in prostration it wasn't going to be in immorality was not going to be out there it wasn't going to be in Europe it wasn't going to be somewhere else long came Jesus the promised one oh yeah it is coming
