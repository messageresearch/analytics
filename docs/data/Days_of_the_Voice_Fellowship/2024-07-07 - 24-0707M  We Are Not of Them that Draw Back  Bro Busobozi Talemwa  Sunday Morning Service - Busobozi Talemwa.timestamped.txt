[1:21:04] Tanzania I was in touch with her and you
[1:21:06] know she was asking me for prayers
[1:21:09] several
[1:21:10] times it is good to see that the lord
[1:21:12] gave her
[1:21:15] grace
[1:21:17] amen praise the Lord I I told you on on
[1:21:21] on Wednesday that I would make an
[1:21:22] announcement today
[1:21:25] [Music]
[1:21:28] um I
[1:21:30] have been having a B for now a
[1:21:36] while to you know to to set an outreach
[1:21:40] program on
[1:21:44] radio I believe that the gospel that we
[1:21:48] have is the truth and I believe it is
[1:21:52] our duty
[1:21:56] to uh to communicate it and send it
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:02] out and so
[1:22:05] um by God's grace I I've been trying to
[1:22:09] wait for an
[1:22:11] opportunity and for
[1:22:14] leadership this week I went to UBC
[1:22:19] radio somehow I've been feeling the
[1:22:22] leadership towards the North
[1:22:28] and so it will be an English
[1:22:31] program it's very
[1:22:34] expensive I realize that English
[1:22:36] programs are more expensive than the
[1:22:38] local language
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:44] programs but it varies of course from
[1:22:46] Station to
[1:22:48] Station so we'll be doing 15
[1:22:52] minutes so we'll be just going at it
[1:22:55] straight
[1:22:59] away and so um we will be doing
[1:23:03] uh 15 minutes on UBC
[1:23:07] radio radi we were supposed to begin
[1:23:10] today this
[1:23:12] Sunday but the week was a bit busy we
[1:23:14] didn't have time to do all the
[1:23:19] recordings uh but next Sunday we will
[1:23:22] announce to you let you know the times
[1:23:27] uh but we are targeting Sunday
[1:23:31] morning from I think
[1:23:36] 7:45 to 8
[1:23:38] around so we we will see how the 15
[1:23:41] minutes will go if it goes very well
[1:23:44] then we will continue with it if not
[1:23:45] then we can add add on more
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:51] time so it's going to cost us
[1:23:55] a total
[1:23:57] of
[1:23:59] uh um I think I lost track on the on the
[1:24:03] on the on the amount of of per
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:10] program yes
[1:24:15] 200,000 per program and that would be
[1:24:17] 800,000 shs a
[1:24:20] month now I know God has already
[1:24:22] provided that money
[1:24:25] amen because it is his perfect will for
[1:24:27] the word to go
[1:24:30] off and I know God is going to send me
[1:24:35] partners and these are among
[1:24:38] you that are going to support this
[1:24:44] program praise the Lord so just pray
[1:24:48] about it and see how the Lord the holy
[1:24:50] spirit will lead you
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:57] amen amen and also I'd like you to pray
[1:25:01] over a certain request that I have
[1:25:04] received from West
[1:25:08] n over about over 1,000 Believers will

[1:36:33] 10 vers
[1:36:37] 35 Brother Sam this is not as good as it
[1:36:41] was yesterday so I do not know what
[1:36:44] changed uh Hebrews chapter
[1:36:50] 10 Hebrews chapter 10:
[1:37:02] 35 praise the
[1:37:10] Lord if you there say
[1:37:18] Amen okay verses uh
[1:37:22] 35 cast not away thereof for your

[1:37:28] reward for ye have need of patience that
[1:37:31] after ye have done the will of God ye
[1:37:33] might receive the promise for yet a
[1:37:35] little while and that and and he that
[1:37:38] shall come will come and will not t now
[1:37:42] the just shall live by faith but if any
[1:37:45] man draw back my soul shall have no
[1:37:47] pleasure in him but we are not of them
[1:37:49] who draw back unto pedition but of them
[1:37:52] that believe to the saving of the Soul
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:49] amenit um I just fa to give you this
[1:38:52] little admonition f
[1:38:58] usually when you coming on church Sunday
[1:39:03] morning preparation does begin in the
[1:39:07] morning preparation begins a day
[1:39:12] before so especially the young people
[1:39:14] I'm requesting that when you know you
[1:39:16] have a service on Sunday morning
[1:39:17] sometimes you find young people doing on
[1:39:20] Sunday
[1:39:24] the reason is they slept very late last
[1:39:29] night and the reason why they sleep late
[1:39:37] night restri I brother I have to
[1:39:40] restrict
[1:39:46] myself especially I don't I'm not on any
[1:39:49] social media Maybe
[1:39:54] which I use on my
[1:39:55] phone but I've had to put a
[1:39:59] limit and I limit myself a few
[1:40:02] minutes
[1:40:04] platforms and when the time passes the
[1:40:07] limit passes it will block me
[1:40:10] out so sometimes if you don't see me
[1:40:12] responding to you on WhatsApp it means
[1:40:14] maybe I'm blocked I can't
[1:40:19] access you realize these things take
[1:40:21] time
[1:40:24] it's a it's something we need to talk
[1:40:25] about
[1:40:27] address especially those of you who have
[1:40:31] smarton you know YouTube these days you
[1:40:33] can keep
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:37] scrolling you know they have those
[1:40:39] shorts and
[1:40:41] those you keep scrolling scrolling
[1:40:44] scrolling scrolling you do not mean to
[1:40:46] be there 1 hour but you end up being
[1:40:47] there for five
[1:40:50] hours I think social media should not
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] contr are for us to control not for
[1:41:01] them if you really want to come to
[1:41:04] Sunday in the church and be
[1:41:07] blessed you need to intentionally
[1:41:11] prepare set yourself up for the
[1:41:15] blessing and you only do that by
[1:41:18] sleeping early the night
[1:41:21] before rising up in the
[1:41:24] morning come refreshed come
[1:41:27] ready
[1:41:29] come and there is no way we cannot hear
[1:41:31] from
[1:41:34] Heaven I would usually appreciate if we
[1:41:38] stay put when we come in the
[1:41:46] service where's
[1:41:49] brother
[1:41:51] brother where
[1:41:53] okay brother okay yeah you are there I
[1:41:56] would appreciate that the Deon stay with
[1:41:59] me throughout the
[1:42:03] service really sometimes you find the
[1:42:05] same person going out
[1:42:08] for sometimes because they kept their
[1:42:12] phone in vibration and someone is
[1:42:13] calling
[1:42:18] them and the presence of God comes down
[1:42:23] because of this person going out coming
[1:42:25] in going out
[1:42:27] coming then it just takes away the
[1:42:30] anointing so let us try to uh stay in
[1:42:34] one
[1:42:35] place uh that we might be able to do not
[1:42:39] not disturb the
[1:42:42] atmosphere that God will be able to
[1:42:44] speak to
[1:42:46] us praise
[1:42:49] God have you found out what happened
[1:42:51] something must have happened something
[1:42:52] must have wrong I'm not hearing myself
[1:42:55] and that makes me straight at home so we
[1:42:59] um I think the quality of the sound is
[1:43:01] not bad Brother Sam but there's a
[1:43:03] problem either with the volume or the
[1:43:05] sound or something one of these monitors
[1:43:07] has gone on I do not know brother Dix
[1:43:10] might want to go support you and try to
[1:43:12] find out what's the problem okay so
[1:43:15] sometimes those things happen and uh you
[1:43:18] find that there is a a
[1:43:20] problem okay so with the brothers so as
[1:43:24] you can see we still trying to renovate
[1:43:26] the
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:29] place it's slow than we
[1:43:35] expected
[1:43:38] yeah is well and it's going as as planed
[1:43:41] it will be
[1:43:44] done so the deons were telling me to
[1:43:47] inform you not to uh how they call those
[1:43:51] things step on them
[1:44:04] right well are we ready for the word
[1:44:06] this
[1:44:07] morning ask your neighbor you ready for
[1:44:09] the
[1:44:10] word are you ready for the
[1:44:13] word now I'm speaking to you this
[1:44:16] morning for we are not of them who draw
[1:44:20] back
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:24] if you can go back to Hebrews
[1:44:27] 10 it says cast not away there for your
[1:44:29] confidence which has great of
[1:44:34] reward for you have need of
[1:44:38] patience after you have done the will of
[1:44:42] God you you might receive the
[1:44:45] promise yet a little while and he that
[1:44:50] shall that shall come will come
[1:44:55] who is going to come
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:44:57] friend who is
[1:45:00] coming Jesus Christ he that promised to
[1:45:04] come will
[1:45:05] come as a matter of fact is coming
[1:45:09] soon and he will
[1:45:11] not now the just shall live by
[1:45:15] faith but any man draw
[1:45:18] back the only thing that is going to
[1:45:20] help us and and give us the ability to
[1:45:23] believe in this
[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:27] christianne is by faith it is Faith
[1:45:31] going to enable
[1:45:32] us to walk in this
[1:45:35] journey I will tell you it is
[1:45:37] increasingly becoming
[1:45:40] difficult for people who profess
[1:45:45] Christianity to live in this
[1:45:48] world is increasingly becoming difficult
[1:45:51] to live as a believer
[1:45:54] because almost in every of life and
[1:45:57] Society you
[1:46:00] go there is compromising
[1:46:03] everywhere there is compromising in our
[1:46:06] standards there is
[1:46:08] compromise in the
[1:46:10] ministry there is compromise among the
[1:46:14] L there is compromise in the
[1:46:16] families there's compromise in
[1:46:19] marriages there is compromise in the
[1:46:21] standards we used to hold
[1:46:27] you find that even many who claim that
[1:46:29] they were alive they dead although they
[1:46:31] still believe and think they are
[1:46:37] alive we are seeing the scripture in
[1:46:44] fulf
[1:46:46] what what does speak
[1:46:49] about the we living
[1:46:53] I wanted to look at it in Revelation
[1:46:55] 3 this was not in my
[1:46:58] notes but I just wanted you to look at
[1:47:02] that vers
[1:47:04] 14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[1:47:08] the
[1:47:10] Lans right the things sayth the amen the
[1:47:15] faithful and true
[1:47:18] witness and the beginning of the
[1:47:21] creation of God
[1:47:25] and he says I
[1:47:27] know neither cold
[1:47:30] or I would th one cold
[1:47:34] orot so God is
[1:47:37] complaining he saying the works of the
[1:47:39] people that are living in the age
[1:47:44] called
[1:47:46] not they are not so you find believers
[1:47:50] who are called believers
[1:47:53] but they are not r h for
[1:47:55] God they are not also cold in the
[1:47:59] world he says they are
[1:48:02] larm so because you are
[1:48:05] larm neither cold
[1:48:07] h i will spew thee out of my
[1:48:11] mouth because thou sayest I am
[1:48:16] rich and increase with goods and have
[1:48:19] need of
[1:48:21] nothing but you do not know that you are
[1:48:24] wretched you are miserable you are poor
[1:48:28] you are blind you are naked this is what
[1:48:31] God thinks of our
[1:48:33] age God thinks of Our Generation as a
[1:48:36] naked
[1:48:38] generation of a generation which is poor
[1:48:42] which is
[1:48:43] blind which
[1:48:44] ised and he gives a
[1:48:47] Cel he says I canel Thee to buy of me
[1:48:51] gold tried in the
[1:48:55] fire that thou may be
[1:48:58] rich white that thou may be
[1:49:01] close the shame of nakedness do not
[1:49:06] appear amen it says anoint your eyes
[1:49:13] with may
[1:49:15] see and he says as many as I
[1:49:18] love I rebuke and I ch
[1:49:24] Beal and repent tell your brother be
[1:49:28] zealous and
[1:49:31] repent now we are in a generation of
[1:49:34] people who who are not
[1:49:37] Sinners people are not
[1:49:40] Sinners when you preach to them they
[1:49:42] tell you I'm
[1:49:44] saved many times I've been walking on
[1:49:47] the streets maybe I'm traveling
[1:49:50] somewhere and I see this this people and
[1:49:52] I feel AB to reach

[1:50:02] message tell them what God has done in
[1:50:04] our
[1:50:05] generation tell them about the second
[1:50:07] coming of
[1:50:08] Jesus tell them about the oncoming
[1:50:11] judgment tell them about one
[1:50:13] God praise the name of and many times
[1:50:17] you you would be out there and you find
[1:50:19] this these
[1:50:21] women painted
[1:50:24] with
[1:50:26] longings know all the
[1:50:31] make the painted
[1:50:34] nails in the
[1:50:37] nutshell painted
[1:50:40] Jezebel now you would go to this woman
[1:50:42] and tell
[1:50:44] her and many times I've asked them what
[1:50:47] do you think about giving your life to
[1:50:50] Jesus they tell you but I gave my LED
[1:50:53] Jesus many years
[1:50:55] ago oh really so you a
[1:50:58] believer I'm a Believer
[1:51:02] go it used to be you see a Believer by
[1:51:05] how they

[1:51:12] way you know how you see
[1:51:16] watermelon a watermelon that is nice and
[1:51:18] and and Beautiful on the inside water
[1:51:23] you could tell that this is a good
[1:51:26] watermelon this must be red this must be
[1:51:30] Tre and then you
[1:51:32] harvested but these days because of the
[1:51:37] hybrids you know you cannot tell you

[1:52:13] deceived the
[1:52:14] people to feel their good and they
[1:52:16] increased with goods and they have need

[1:57:01] coming believe Jesus is
[1:57:04] coming that is the them of this

[1:57:15] any
[1:57:17] time we not here for big
[1:57:20] mystery no
[1:57:22] the Mysteries are only meant to prepare
[1:57:25] us but let me tell you the reason
[1:57:30] whyin because we believe in his
[1:57:37] coming we would just go there for 1 hour
[1:57:39] or 30
[1:57:41] minutes we but time
[1:57:45] came our eyes were
[1:57:47] open our eyes of
[1:57:50] understanding we were able to see
[1:57:53] that is not enough to prepare us even
[1:57:57] what we are hearing
[1:57:58] there we need to hear a
[1:58:02] fire to he something that will shake
[1:58:05] us we need to hear something which will
[1:58:07] wake
[1:58:10] us how many Christians are sleeping
[1:58:13] today let me tell you amen I'm going to
[1:58:17] be one of those little
[1:58:18] ones that will shout the
[1:58:24] rooftop there is something someone with
[1:58:26] ears to
[1:58:27] hear we hear will revive themselves they
[1:58:32] will be restored back again I'm telling
[1:58:35] you there is a great Falling
[1:58:38] Away who claim their
[1:58:41] standing they

[1:58:49] in the word they dead
[1:58:52] they have a name they Christian and when
[1:58:55] you ask
[1:58:57] Christ if he knows them he will say I
[1:59:00] never knew
[1:59:02] them when you see how would we know that
[1:59:05] he doesn't know
[1:59:06] them Christ cannot know
[1:59:09] you if the word does not know
[1:59:12] you but many of us believe the things we
[1:59:16] do the life we live if we look and
[1:59:20] compare ourselves with the word
[1:59:28] tell you brother if the word of God
[1:59:30] denies
[1:59:32] you Jesus will deny you
[1:59:35] there you need to realign
[1:59:37] yourself with the word of
[1:59:40] God you need to wake up you need to come
[1:59:43] back again to the reason why we end time

[2:08:31] well some of these people know how to
[2:08:34] sing let me tell you let me let me make
[2:08:38] a
[2:08:39] confession and this the
[2:08:42] truth they know how to sing better than
[2:08:46] us they know how to preach better than
[2:08:49] us the only thing they have is not the
[2:08:54] truth that's all they don't have but
[2:08:57] they know how to do
[2:08:58] this when you talk about women
[2:09:01] preachers who told you they don't know
[2:09:02] how to
[2:09:03] PR you know women preachers preach
[2:09:05] better than
[2:09:08] men by the way you know some of you
[2:09:11] think we are saying women don't know how
[2:09:14] to
[2:09:16] preach history
[2:09:18] has that women actually are better
[2:09:20] public speakers than
[2:09:23] [Music]
[2:09:27] men they know how toce
[2:09:30] people they know to
[2:09:33] the that
[2:09:36] even thought she had so much ability
[2:09:41] in that she knew she would convince the
[2:09:44] devil
[2:09:46] [Music]
[2:09:48] otherwise she knew she would do it the
[2:09:52] extent said do not eat but she was over
[2:09:56] excited and she knew how to you know she
[2:09:59] was good with our
[2:10:01] words she added on what God
[2:10:04] Said She Said we not eat Hallelujah I
[2:10:09] even touch God never
[2:10:12] say that was an invention of

[2:28:07] things but what the devil does the devil
[2:28:10] will invite you to come from the
[2:28:14] C teaching you the truth and will take
[2:28:17] you in a place where they do all sorts
[2:28:21] of things that are
[2:28:25] extra all right so you find
[2:28:28] yourself dropped in a
[2:28:32] fellowship which is not a fellowship of
[2:28:34] the
[2:28:36] word oh my am I preaching to Believers
[2:28:39] today the Bible says whatever the cus
[2:28:43] the fresh meat the fresh kill
[2:28:46] is they are the
[2:28:48] what oh come on that is the the eag
[2:28:55] areed we are
[2:28:59] e we are E and E are always gathered
[2:29:03] around where the
[2:29:07] is hallelujah come to our Bible
[2:29:11] class and go to bible class and they
[2:29:14] reject every word you have no business
[2:29:20] you don't have a business on an altar
[2:29:23] that does not hold the word of God
[2:29:29] dear every you go
[2:29:32] to must be lifting up the word of
[2:29:37] God hallelujah do not accept to be
[2:29:42] defiled def in
[2:29:45] anyway but this man called
[2:29:48] balam he took the children of
[2:29:51] God he made them to be
[2:29:54] invited into the party
[2:29:59] of and they went
[2:30:01] there and when they began doing their
[2:30:05] worship they started
[2:30:07] worshiping doing their
[2:30:10] Dan you know how they do
[2:30:12] them we still have the same Spirit here
[2:30:15] today you don't know we still do have
[2:30:20] throwing their
[2:30:21] legs of course dressed in the way you
[2:30:23] know
[2:30:25] how and you feel is it is not
[2:30:28] fine that's not the god of the
[2:30:31] Bible the god of the Bible will show
[2:30:33] them how to dress
[2:30:37] decent if you have the spirit of God in
[2:30:40] your he will tell you sister brother you
[2:30:43] must dress
[2:30:45] this sister he will make you keep your
[2:30:47] hair
[2:30:51] not cutting it off brother he will make
[2:30:53] you shave and
[2:30:57] look but you see they go to this part
[2:31:01] and they begin
[2:31:05] [Music]
[2:31:07] dancing and then
[2:31:10] begin and people
[2:31:14] think it was not it was
[2:31:18] entertainment it maybe it was worship to
[2:31:21] another the of
[2:31:24] God praise God praise God and then
[2:31:29] afterwards the Bible says the children
[2:31:32] of God the sons of Israel they saw the
[2:31:36] beautiful
[2:31:38] bodies of the
[2:31:42] other
[2:31:48] and we know the have the beautiful
[2:31:52] choir but some of you have been in
[2:31:57] PC what goes on
[2:31:59] there there this brother who is a
[2:32:03] leader and all these sisters in the
[2:32:06] choir moving around
[2:32:08] them the
[2:32:10] musicians most of them are living dived
[2:32:15] lives is this what we
[2:32:18] want is this what we want
[2:32:21] we should not draw back we should not go
[2:32:24] back where we came
[2:32:26] from we should hold the
[2:32:30] standard stand of the
[2:32:33] word oh my many of them are in
[2:32:36] church having boyfriends having
[2:32:40] girlfriends oh mothers excuse me let me
[2:32:43] talk to the young people
[2:32:45] today you find them living in that kind
[2:32:48] of life
[2:32:51] cabi doing all sorts of
[2:32:54] things but when they come in the church
[2:32:57] these very people doing these
[2:32:59] things supposedly the spirit will fall
[2:33:02] on them
[2:33:04] first you find them rotating
[2:33:07] everywhere falling
[2:33:12] everywhere but when you see their life
[2:33:15] it is
[2:33:18] lacking there is no of
[2:33:21] Christ I don't care how much you shout I
[2:33:24] don't care how much you say I believe I
[2:33:27] don't care how much you say God bless
[2:33:28] you what I want to see is your
[2:33:32] life you cannot claim to be a
[2:33:35] believer and Fall
[2:33:37] Away the teachings of the
[2:33:40] word and that's the only
[2:33:42] area will try to
[2:33:45] capture and then when they became last
[2:33:49] he went into
[2:33:51] fornication but God was
[2:33:53] angry the devil was happy he
[2:33:57] said I fulfilled
[2:34:00] it God
[2:34:02] said I'm angry with all of
[2:34:05] you
[2:34:07] 23,000
[2:34:11] Israelites were killed in one
[2:34:14] day and the Bible says these things were
[2:34:16] written for our example
[2:34:20] we too should not fall in the
[2:34:22] same are you following me church we
[2:34:25] should not fall in the same
[2:34:28] seat and the scripture would say
[2:34:32] here they just shall live by
[2:34:35] [Music]
[2:34:37] faith and I was reading a it says but
[2:34:39] they went right back into the into it
[2:34:41] like a dog to its
[2:34:44] vomit to
[2:34:47] swallow went right back again into
[2:34:50] that and now we've wondered another 50
[2:34:53] years wondering in the
[2:34:57] wilderness there was a time when God
[2:35:00] said you've been on this mountain long
[2:35:04] enough come on we are going
[2:35:08] over may it
[2:35:10] be's experience now in
[2:35:16] this an experience again
[2:35:21] that that God the holy spirit will speak
[2:35:24] to the people of this
[2:35:27] generation they sons as they did back
[2:35:31] there when the old Fighters have died
[2:35:33] out that F that
[2:35:37] fought I want to show you
[2:35:40] Saints about why when you do not draw
[2:35:47] back how God is pleased
[2:35:51] let us all turn to Genesis
[2:36:10] 22 and it came to pass after these
[2:36:12] things that God did temp did tempt
[2:36:15] Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he
[2:36:18] said behold here am and he said take now
[2:36:21] thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou
[2:36:24] lovest and get thee into the land of
[2:36:26] Moriah and offer him there for a bur
[2:36:29] offering upon one of the mountains which
[2:36:35] [Music]
[2:36:54] and abam Rose up
[2:36:56] Ear morning and SED his ass and took two
[2:36:59] of his young men with him and Isaac his
[2:37:01] son and C the wood for the burnt
[2:37:03] offering and he rose up and went up un
[2:37:05] the place which God had told him
[2:37:23] praise the name of the
[2:37:24] Lord that's 10% praise the name of the
[2:37:28] Lord amen now I want you to look at this
[2:37:31] church how many believe they have a
[2:37:33] calling of God upon
[2:37:36] their I believe I have a
[2:37:39] calling amen for as many as he did
[2:37:43] call he did
[2:37:45] justify know he has Justified us
[2:37:49] praise God and
[2:37:53] yesterday yesterday was
[2:37:57] what Saturday no Friday God called
[2:38:00] another
[2:38:01] one our brother was
[2:38:05] baptized the name of the
[2:38:09] Lord let us give the Lord hand of Praise
[2:38:12] hallelujah amen and I believe God is
[2:38:14] still
[2:38:15] calling amen and so God called Abraham
[2:38:20] and and and he called him
[2:38:22] out told him to go to a land which you
[2:38:24] will tell
[2:38:26] him was it
[2:38:29] easy it was not easy it was very
[2:38:32] difficult it was very hard it was very
[2:38:37] complicated to forsake
[2:38:39] everything brother cannot serve
[2:38:44] God unless you forsake everything
[2:38:50] you have to forsake
[2:38:52] everything for the sake of
[2:38:55] Christ praise the name of the
[2:38:59] Lord if you cannot forsake
[2:39:02] everything then you're not a worthy
[2:39:06] candidate you have to accept to
[2:39:10] for tell your neighbor you have to
[2:39:12] [Applause]
[2:39:14] for you know what you have to
[2:39:17] forsake do you know it
[2:39:20] neigh do they
[2:39:24] know maybe your
[2:39:26] joy was giving it Joy or something that
[2:39:28] was you know these things are the things
[2:39:30] you
[2:39:32] forsake yes you have to forsake your

[2:39:47] someone did not say Amen it means
[2:39:50] [Applause]
[2:39:52] for you need to
[2:39:55] forsake you need to forsake and when you
[2:39:58] forsake those
[2:40:00] things then you will follow the voice of
[2:40:03] God and God later on you know Abraham in
[2:40:07] that new
[2:40:09] land you know he was in that
[2:40:13] place and you know he still did not have
[2:40:16] a
[2:40:17] child but then God came
[2:40:20] down and gave him a child one thing that
[2:40:23] I know about God he fulfills all his
[2:40:28] promises sometimes it takes a
[2:40:31] while but he's a faithful

[2:49:47] mind to go back
[2:49:49] [Applause]
[2:49:51] I don't know what do you

[2:50:02] up
[2:50:03] up keep
[2:50:06] moving neighbor

[2:50:19] what is
[2:50:22] three is
[2:50:26] what is perfection is comption comption
[2:50:31] perfe seven is
[2:50:34] comption
[2:50:39] is if you've not attained that
[2:50:42] moment break
[2:50:44] through maybe you your your suffering is
[2:50:47] not yet
[2:50:51] perfect when it becomes
[2:50:55] perfect that's when the miracle is
[2:50:59] going moment but many people give up at
[2:51:02] that
[2:51:03] moment Abraham has walked for the first
[2:51:06] day he has his child and the servants
[2:51:09] and donkeys is tired the second day he
[2:51:14] was an old man the third day he's tired
[2:51:19] maybe was like maybe should give
[2:51:21] up but then a far off on the
[2:51:26] mountain he saw the place how did he
[2:51:29] know that that was the place God must
[2:51:31] have spoken to
[2:51:33] him and told him Abraham that is the
[2:51:37] place I don't know how many of you can
[2:51:39] see by

[2:52:28] mountain as far as you are
[2:52:31] concerned stay here with the
[2:52:35] donkeys someone didn't pick the
[2:52:38] Revelation sometimes you need to tell

[2:52:43] people and some
[2:52:45] situations to stay with the donkeys
[2:52:49] if you've seen the
[2:52:51] place by
[2:53:03] faith have to

[2:54:00] that by
[2:54:01] faith Abraham when he was
[2:54:05] tried he offered up
[2:54:08] Isaac he never killed him but he
[2:54:10] actually had killed him already
[2:54:14] his and he had received the promises
[2:54:17] offered up his own only begotten
[2:54:21] son of whom it was
[2:54:24] said that in
[2:54:26] Isaac shall th seed be

[2:55:36] married because I did not laugh they did
[2:55:40] not know that actually I
[2:55:43] loved but none of them was worthy for me

[3:07:29] sea driven with a wind and
[3:07:34] TOS for let him that for let not that
[3:07:37] man think that he shall receive anything
[3:07:39] of the
[3:07:41] world a dou minded man is unstable in
[3:07:44] all his ways
[3:07:47] don't be double
[3:07:49] minded in your
[3:07:52] ways about serving God no
[3:07:56] question are you hearing me church about
[3:07:59] coming to church no question by the way
[3:08:02] why am I
[3:08:04] emphasizing you won't even Prosper the
[3:08:06] other things you're doing if you don't
[3:08:07] attend
[3:08:12] Fellowship it's not
[3:08:15] possible it's not possible
[3:08:17] unless if you're not a
[3:08:19] Believer these rules apply to Believers
[3:08:25] only you have to be in the
[3:08:28] Lord for him to bless
[3:08:30] you does he bless the ones who are
[3:08:33] out for sure he
[3:08:36] does
[3:08:38] because they are serving their
[3:08:41] God and they're working with their
[3:08:43] hands and and and and and and he will
[3:08:46] bless them
[3:08:48] because the rain falls on the just
[3:08:52] and but I've never seen a
[3:08:54] father who disciplines children that are
[3:08:56] not
[3:09:00] his he a father will discipline his own
