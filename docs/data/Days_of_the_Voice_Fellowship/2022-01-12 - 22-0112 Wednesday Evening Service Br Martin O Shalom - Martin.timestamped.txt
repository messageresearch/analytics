[27:58] of the lord it came to pass that the
[28:00] lord spake unto joshua the son of noon
[28:03] moses
[28:05] moses minister saying
[28:09] moses my servant is dead and now
[28:11] therefore arise go over the jordan
[28:15] go over this jordan thou and all the
[28:18] people unto the land which i gave to

[28:24] every place that the soul of your food
[28:27] shall throw upon that have i given unto
[28:31] you as i said unto moses from the
[28:34] wilderness and to the
[28:36] lebanon even onto the great river the
[28:38] river is ready in the land of the
[28:41] hittite and onto the great sea toward
[28:43] the going down of the sun
[28:46] shall be your coast
[28:48] there shall not any man be able to stand
[28:51] before thee all the days of thy life as
[28:55] i was with moses so i will be with thee
[28:58] i will not fail thee not forsake thee
[29:10] um

[30:38] thou may uh observe to do according to
[30:41] all the law which moses my servant

[30:46] right
[30:47] hand or to the left that thou may
[30:50] prosper whatever thou goest
[32:13] friends who are from himalayas
[32:18] we say that lord is our heartburn within
[32:20] us when he was speaking to us
[32:25] we believe that hebrews 13 8 is still
[32:28] alive that jesus were the same yesterday
[32:30] today
[32:36] in christ jesus we pray
[32:40] amen amina may be seated
[32:45] praise be to god
[32:49] amen amina this evening uh i just have a
[32:54] thought that i want us
[32:59] and we're going to call it fighting for
[33:02] our inheritance
[33:07] praise be to god
[33:24] now therefore arise go over this jordan
[33:28] thou and all these people and to
[33:32] and to the land which i do give to them
[33:35] even to the children of
[33:50] food shall throw upon
[33:53] that have i given unto you as i said
[33:58] unto moses
[34:00] [Music]
[34:07] we are seeing all of us bible readers
[34:11] we know the story about moses
[34:18] god used moses to bring children of
[34:20] israel out of egypt
[34:26] not to destroy them in the wilderness
[34:30] but god had a reason why he called them
[34:33] out
[34:37] god spoke to abraham and told him that
[34:40] he would bring them out of bondage
[34:45] and it would take them to their promised
[34:47] lands
[34:49] praise be to god come here and moses did
[34:52] not marry the promised land
[34:56] he died on the way
[35:00] god told him to climb on the mountain
[35:02] and show them the promised land
[35:10] moses managed to see the land
[35:14] from
[35:43] i mean even in the days we are living in
[35:45] nemo quiznos to him we did not see our
[35:49] moses
[35:52] praise be to god
[35:54] because moses was the prophet
[36:22] is telling him to arise
[36:36] [Music]
[37:06] the promise is yeah they should be the
[37:08] jeffrey but the devil is not willing
[37:11] it's not just going to let you go and
[37:12] take it
[37:17] you will have to fight for every inch of
[37:19] the promise
[37:34] therefore shall not any man be able to
[37:38] stand before thee
[37:44] i will not fail
[37:48] forsake
[38:08] [Applause]
[38:26] christian life is all about fighting
[38:28] over where you can stay on parole you
[38:31] will tell me but the prophet tells us
[38:33] that christianity's all is based on
[38:34] resting
[38:40] but remember
[38:42] before ruth rested
[38:58] if you read more scriptures go so many
[39:01] hours
[39:02] see how god do his things
[39:07] that god could fight for israelites
[39:11] but did not sweep their enemies
[39:23] [Music]
[39:25] is
[39:40] is

[43:41] that he is waiting for you to do
[43:43] something
[43:45] you must move
[43:48] praise be to god amen the prophet tells
[43:50] us

[44:35] no sabbah when you start praying
[44:37] ordaining okay you realize that your
[44:39] prayer is going nowhere
[44:44] and sometimes
[44:45] something will easily give up
[45:16] is
[45:20] [Music]
[45:28] it is a key to christian life
[45:36] [Music]

[47:17] shows us our promises
[47:21] of your faith and then he lived after he
[47:24] leaves that on us
[47:28] praise be to god come over here god is
[47:30] reminding joshua
[47:32] that you consider yourself about the
[47:34] death of moses
[47:50] have sponsored people behind him

[49:18] stand before us
[49:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[49:28] we have an inheritance to fight for
[49:30] torino
[49:33] and the prophet says something in this
[49:35] message
[49:38] of separation i must say
[50:00] you see that uh i used to oftentimes
[50:04] wonder what the what is the matter with
[50:07] the christian church
[50:09] again
[50:18] why they have got nothing to be scared
[50:20] about
[50:22] [Music]
[50:24] the first words nearly jesus said after
[50:26] the resurrection fear not
[50:30] yes
[50:35] do not fear don't yeah
[50:38] don't get scared don't
[50:40] yeah
[50:42] there ain't nothing going to happen
[50:47] nothing can happen nothing can
[50:49] bother a christian they worry to change
[51:29] [Music]
[51:39] [Music]
[51:48] [Applause]
[52:26] [Applause]
[52:30] but you must
[52:43] amen he paid for each and
[52:58] because the bible
[53:18] [Music]
[54:06] [Music]
[54:36] without the holy spirit forever enough
[54:39] we have no chance
[54:42] before we get the holy spirit
[54:46] you have not even become a worshipper
[54:50] god has not even recognized your worship
[54:52] catholic caesar
[54:56] but remember the prophet tells us
[54:59] god is more willing to give us the whole
[55:01] city and even we who are yearning for it
[55:03] underway
[55:18] it is preached
[55:20] until believers are like that we get
[55:23] used of it
[55:26] and we don't take step
[55:28] two
[55:29] deep into that then that was
[55:32] praise
[55:47] to go and do research on this while in
[55:48] the way thing to be aware known as
[55:51] praise be to god come and ever see you
[55:53] know the problem with religion
[55:56] you hear something
[55:58] you hear it again
[56:00] and then you
[56:10] [Music]
[56:11] but
[56:12] it's not supposed to be like that with
[56:14] christians have a christie i'm a
[56:16] christian
[56:17] away to you
[56:19] praise you to god come and ever see we
[56:20] know our soul
[56:23] we know the life we are living oh
[56:25] whatever we're truly talking about we
[56:26] know where we're
[56:29] get staying
[56:29] bed to my neighbor praise be to god
[56:32] we are not pleasers of men the truly
[56:35] works on saban too but we are here to
[56:37] please god to you and oxendine
[56:39] sacramento know what god requires from
[56:42] us
[56:47] you know that coming to church is not
[56:49] enough
[56:54] you know him in the street which god
[56:56] wants you to take
[57:10] but the spirit of god is orderly
[57:14] he is disciplined
[57:17] you cannot enter into cheering holy
[57:20] ghost and then you misbehave
[57:21] [Music]
[57:36] suppose you receive a call just right
[57:38] now here
[57:54] i used to work with your father in
[57:56] earlier
[57:57] seventies
[58:00] but there is a land he purchased here
[58:05] it is a hundred by a hundred ladies
[58:15] [Music]
[58:20] i realized that some people are trying
[58:22] to
[58:23] they want to steal this language
[58:34] huh
[58:38] when you you receive the information
[58:40] from reliable source
[58:47] rather even if you don't have transport
[58:49] to go there oh it means to go there
[58:54] let me walk there just right now
[58:59] it's not fair
[59:19] [Music]
[59:31] and set home to treatment another
[59:33] opportunity that would be like an
[59:35] opportunity praise be to god amen how
[59:38] much more
[59:39] how old we that you see you're fighting
[59:42] for a spiritual inheritance
[1:00:12] words of wisdom enrique mariana
[1:00:16] enemy interpretation
[1:00:18] praise be to god
[1:00:20] those are your inheritance
[1:00:26] and the bible tells us to
[1:00:30] be able to come but we're going
[1:00:32] or will not be
[1:00:34] the bible says that we convey prophecies
[1:00:37] praise be to god amen the reason is uh
[1:00:40] just give some of them we are not
[1:00:42] singing this
[1:00:46] not because god is not in our mission
[1:00:50] but it's because
[1:00:53] we are not converting them
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:59] the reason as to why
[1:01:01] we don't have the holy ghost
[1:01:05] and we are just settled that's why
[1:01:08] it is because
[1:01:21] it will be too late
[1:01:34] we are getting close to the coming of
[1:01:36] the lord
[1:01:40] every day
[1:01:42] the grace is moving toward the jews
[1:01:47] leaving the gentiles
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:27] [Music]
[1:02:32] because it's in the spirit of
[1:02:34] drunkenness
[1:02:39] an apostle is telling us
[1:02:44] that we should not be drunk of wine
[1:02:47] never about to tell me no more you know
[1:02:49] we should be drunk of the spirit
[1:02:55] um a drunken person can bypass you
[1:02:57] without even seeing you why would she be
[1:02:59] to come back
[1:03:14] the physical things will lose meaning to
[1:03:17] you
[1:03:18] praise be to god amen
[1:03:21] because like the drunken money can
[1:03:23] bypass you unknowingly it is like how a
[1:03:25] blanket a man can pass you without
[1:03:27] seeing that is how you also bypass
[1:03:49] [Applause]
[1:03:57] we'll spend them on our knees the young
[1:03:59] people speaking for god's mercies
[1:04:07] praise be to god come on because the
[1:04:09] holy ghost speaks from the word of god
[1:04:17] amen
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:20] we have got an inheritance to fight
[1:04:23] foreign

[1:06:45] you know yes jesus is the truth yes you
[1:06:47] came as jesus jesus
[1:06:55] of the holy spirit
[1:07:11] maybe some of the disciples
[1:07:39] he will teach you these things
[1:08:10] i mean
[1:08:11] amen i mean
[1:08:13] when they are filled with the holy
[1:08:15] spirit whereby
[1:08:17] i think when peter was preaching that
[1:08:20] part there there was a peter over here
[1:08:22] to come
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:08:35] in the name of the lord
[1:10:29] [Applause]
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:11:10] the biggest building in such and such a
[1:11:12] place is mine praise before god i mean
[1:11:14] that is how we ought to be turning a bed
[1:11:17] away to you
[1:11:19] christian we are not supposed to be
[1:11:20] statue
[1:11:23] golden look
[1:11:51] [Music]
