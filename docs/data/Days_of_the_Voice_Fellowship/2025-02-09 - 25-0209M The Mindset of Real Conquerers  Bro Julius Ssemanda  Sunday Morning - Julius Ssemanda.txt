[Applause] so God bless you brother amen let us go the reading of the word first Samuel chapter 14 1 then I will jump when I read vers 13 to 15 now it came to pass upon a day that Jonathan that Jonathan the son of sa said unto the young man that bear his armor let us go over to the Philistines that is on the other side but he told not his father and s in the uttermost part of a pomegranate tree which is in migon and the people that were with him were about 600 men and the son of brother son Lord and the people knew not that Jonathan was God and Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and they fell before Jonathan and his arm after him and that first Slaughter which Jonathan and his was about 20 men two men two men 20 men within as it were half of land which a y of oen Might plow and there was the trembling in the host bu and among all the people the G Stone and the spoilers they also trembled and the Earth quck so it was a very great trembling amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word amen amen you may take your seats God bless the Elders here and the Elder the Elders of the church the mothers and fathers The Young and the old and all the youths God bless you all God bless the ministers brother Mar and brother Dan and other God Rich bless they are more than preachers I came to realize they sacrifice they teach a good example amen amen may God add the blessing to the reading of his word let us start it over like this my subject today is the mindset of real conquerors the mindset of real conquerors from all through the week I knew what exactly I knew that I was going to share if God does wheels and doesn't change but I tried I wrote a sermon the hardest time is to choose which someone to preach and what tit to give it gives me hard time very hard so I wrote a certain message I it one title going to the enemy's camp and I wrote that one but I could not feel it I wrote another it another title still I said God what do you want me I wrot another one I called breaking the wrong mindset it reached Saturday at night say God what should I tell this people I don't know what you want me to tell it reached almost 11 I don't know what I stood Move Around My Room my bedroom and I I say God should I tell these people like it reached midnight I came down I said I'll join this message with the other breaking the wrong mindset going down to the enemy and I'll get one subject the mindset of a real conquer it took me almost up when I I and at five I was awake so the head was but the soul was strong the mind set of a real conqueror conquerors Conquering the enemy the the camps of their enemy says in the message the mighty conqueror 1958 I want to deliver this not more than one hour and 30 minutes I just want to stay there that's one says in the message the might conquer that man has set out since the ages began to conquer since the ages began man has set out to conquer man likes to be a conqueror human beings like to be conquerors it's the nature of human beings to desire to conquer and it is a great thing to be a conqueror he says it is not little it is a great thing to be a conqueror he says a conqueror is the one who has overcome his enemy so for to be a conqueror you must Ser an enemy for you to desire to be a conqueror you must Ser something to conquer for to be called a warrior you must have a battle to fight say man he loves to be a and it is great when men conquer and conquer don't run away from their enemies they attack their enemies they attack their enemies they don't wait for the enemy to attack them if they know that's my enemy I do not care whether there is a peace between me and my enemy will attack the enemy and how comes How can there be peace between you and your enemy there is a peace between you and the devil he has conquered you he has conquered you but if he after you then you are conquering so they attack their enemy and break him down the Bible says that that Saul and the army of Israel they sat in the pmeg granite tree took a shade and the Philistines were over the other Sid they could not attack their enemies they were just so like defeated but there was one that was called Jonathan the son of he went beyond the going beyond the camp he did not care he didn't care what his father's mindset was concerning the battle he just made a decision a personal decision that I'll go out Beyond this Camp go to the camp of the enemy as one man as one man with this come let us go over the other side to the camp of the philes it may be that the Lord May deliver them into our hands he had 5050 faith and defeat but it may be that the faith was little I would go anyhow and he went to the camp of the enemy and reaching there the Bible says he asked a sign from the Lord he asked a sign from the Lord and the lord gave him a that when they shall call you and they say come he says I will go and reveal myself to my enemy I'm going to fight the enemy I'm not going to fight the enemy when I'm hiding I reveal myself to my enemy and he revealed himself I'm a be and when he revealed himself and they called them he said that is the sign God has delivered them into the hands of Israel his victory was not his only it was for Israel but he went as one man the victory not only yours for the Church of God your testimony is not only yours I can use your testimony to edify someone in the name of the Lord and the Bible says that Jonathan and his arm bear they fought the Battle and men and the Earth shook there was a great shaking and a great trembling it was not a great me it was one man taking God at his word it was one man a circumcised man that knew that as long as I'm circumcised the army of the uncircumcised cannot defeat the circumcised the Bible says after that Victory all all Israel they stood up where St was and the army they stood up and they said what's happening who has going away from us and they saw it was Jonathan and they went they chased after the enemy someone had to conquer someone had to conquer the faith of the [Music] church someone had to go Pastor to go that there be a church today someone has to go that the army of God may be encouraged for God to move someone has to take a step the Bible says the armies of the Philistines God came down God came down in a great way that the enemies to fight against oh my God confused the enemies to fight against themselves there was some children of Israel that had followed the pH they were fighting together with the Philistines but the Bible says after the victory of Jonathan they turned they turned around and started to fight the philis brothers and sisters today that have left the word backen defeated and now are serving the enemy but someday when they shall hear your testimony when they shall hear your testimony your Victory what the Lord has done for you and you are singing see what the Lord has done my hands have touched it my feet have felt it I have it they will turn around and he fight the devil and he come back to the church they enemy the Bible says that he defeated the enemy the enemies Camp God gave them Victory because somebody someone had a mindset of a real conqueror brother sister you have got to fight until you defeat your enemy that's the mindset of a conquer conquerors real conquerors a Risk Takers they take a risk oh God hallelujah hallelujah if the Lord be God if the Lord be God where be his miracles they take a risk because they want to see the power of the Living God real conquerors are record Breakers they set a record and a standard real conquer they live Footprints upon the sons of they leave a path they leave a path that another Soldier we and tired can walk through and March onto Victory rise up Church get the mindset of a real conquer real conquerors don't run away from their fears they face what they Fe and what they fear fears them they doubt their doubts they believe the words we serve a god of Miracle we serve a god of paradox he can do Paradox but the only way you can see these things is when you go down and he meet the enemy in his camp we sing a song I went to the enemy took back what is hallelujah brother sister you would be better you would better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys when you know your enemy comes to steal kill and destroy and he means business and he has no mercy oh it's so little this is just a small thing I overc it the devil has a stry can your little fing if he can CRI your little finger well this is just a little finger I can do without it when it is not there you will know that you needed it devil that spirit that you think is little is not J he has come to to make he is determined to take your soul to the gates of heav brother sister better destroy your enemy before your enemy can destroy you and as long as you are determined as long as you are determined to get the victory you will always get the victory you want the victory as long as you are determined to get the victory you are bound to get the victory anywhere any place any time under any circumstance as long as you use the right weapon the word of God it will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any circumstan let the Oceans Rise and the Thunders R let the torment let the devil afflict oh brother you can defeat him I remember David going against he was Fearless he was Bal the Bible says the right b as a lion b as lion they are the kings of their territor Hallelujah they rule their territories maybe because you are silent the devil is having Prem in

the earth he have got a father over y who has conquered for me I've got a father over your who has called me I've got a father that supplies my needs Devils can defeat Nations they can defeat Kings they can defeat great men but they can't Prevail against the Church of God thou Henry thou shalom shalom but I say unto you upon this I build my church and the Gates of Heaven shall not amen nations are failing kingdoms are failing they are passing away but we receive a kingdom that can't be Shen the unshakable the children of God the Church of Jesus the devil can't Prevail against it's undefeatable it's undefeatable it's invisible years have come and years have gone but the Church of Jesus still goes on till the trumpet will sound on the final day brother sister the time has come for you to reject this world to reject the devil and EMB the cross have made up my mind to follow Jesus to go that way to go God's way for the rest of my life the time has come to live for him that died for you to live for him that took your pain this is the time today is your day make up your mind Choose You whom are you going to follow if go is God follow you have got to let go of the world you have got to let go of the wrong motives you have got to let go of the wrong objectives you have got to let go of the mindset of a failure says and if a man is a conqueror his objective must be right get the right objective I have f a good of faith I have kept my stay in your keep your cost fight your fight do your purpose then you will rise he says he must be right his objective must be right and his motive must be right and if you don't play the game fair you are bound to lose no matter how much a conqueror you are b a f on principles no matter how much declarations you make no matter how much declarations you make if you don't play the game right of Salvation you are bound to lose oh brother the time will fail me if I mention [Music] all you have to follow the rules of the game to be a winner and if you cheat if you cheat you are put out of the game there is no shortcut to Christianity there is no shortcut to Salvation it you repent be baptized in of Jesus be filled with the Holy Spirit be born again that is the way there is no shortcut you follow the rules of the game a winner well it's for all the fa for one you come the fair is paid for one and all the master bids you come but when you come take your position and follow the rules of the for you to be a winner and if you cheat you are put out no matter how good a player you are you are put out of the game any man Paul says any manes for the Mastery for the mastery in all things self control in all things because ising for what he has got a mindset of a real conqueror it is a character that conquers not power for power without character is satanic you have got to have character for you to conquer enemy real conquerors don't seek all the glory and power to themselves and to be feared like and Napoleon and constan and the politicians and religious leaders the great man of today that's not conquerors that's not the mindset of real conquerors you can't conquer by wrong you conquer through sin or through evil only right Will Conquer only right will my sister was telling me I love her so much she follows me I I was telling that in the church when we have Fellowship in the rest you know she told me brother I was calling you that you sent me some I think that I may pay this people said they can connect me for a job she's not a Believer but with relatives with relatives first put away those

my knees save our soul save our soul and one day I will baptize her in the name of the Lord Jesus I have said it before you and I believe it brother sister change your mindset of the real conqueror he says only right Will Conquer you will never conquer by you corupt your way you give you bribe so that they let you go deals here and there and you bring in your tit why do you bring St in the of the Lord you do things here and [Music] there call them whatever gings ofs of the devil Propet only right Will Conquer you can't coner by cheating you never conquer by prolighting your church you can't brother that's not how we conquer that's not how we conquer you will never conquer by building up one denomination another you only conquer as you let down the bus you can't conquer by building up one denomination above another you will only conquer as you let down the and let the Holy Spirit come into the entire body Jesus Christ we can only conquer by the Holy Ghost you will never conquer I'm in the message God the might conquer you will never conquer as long as we are selfish you'll never conquer as long as you are selfish God man has set out to conquer and men has set out to and man likes to be conquered but we shall never conquer as long as we are selfish God hates sin be real conquerors have the mindset of a real conquer Christianity is not a set of [Music] traditions it's a life to be the trouble of it today many conquerors don't know that they are real conquerors they look at themselves asil I can't do this I'm not F to do this I'm not worthy well it is God's let us wait and see May things will what can I do let it be as it uhuh you are just conforting yourself to stay in your condition break that wrong mindset listen Church you are not poor even without money even without food even without a job even without a business I say still you are not don't say that you are poor simply you have got a need you are not poor you just have a need as simple as [Music] that and God is the god of the [Music] need you a conqueror more than a conqueror you got to change your confession to be a conqueror the Bible says overcame him by the word of the and by the word the
