[1:30:06] song ancient words ever
[1:30:09] true changing me and changing
[1:30:13] you. We have come with open
[1:30:16] heart. Let the ancient words of God
[1:30:21] impart. While the preacher is
[1:30:24] preaching and the word is going
[1:30:27] for, the Holy Spirit catches that
[1:30:30] word and reveals it to you. He catches
[1:30:34] that
[1:30:35] word and gives it
[1:30:38] life and comes to your
[1:30:40] heart. He puts the life of the
[1:30:44] word. Because if he gives you that word,
[1:30:47] Without the Holy Spirit, we won't get to
[1:30:50] the
[1:30:52] light. So our prayer is
[1:30:55] always Lord take the
[1:30:58] word as we preach. We have the
[1:31:01] mechanics add the
[1:31:04] dynamics. Give it
[1:31:07] life before your
[1:31:09] people their lives. He hatches and
[1:31:12] breathes over
[1:31:15] you and he changes
[1:31:18] you. Ever true ancient
[1:31:21] words, they are old
[1:31:24] words but they are ever
[1:31:27] true, ever alive.
[1:31:31] See brothers and
[1:31:34] sisters, the inspiration of the
[1:31:38] Lord, you know when I wrote this
[1:31:43] message, when I wrote
[1:31:45] it, then we came to the
[1:31:49] overnight and brother Martin read the
[1:31:53] scripture and he started to
[1:31:55] preach man. He was finishing
[1:31:58] it. I said God you moved and gave me a
[1:32:03] message then you moved and gave
[1:32:07] brother he's finishing
[1:32:09] it so I could say amen
[1:32:12] hallelujah but
[1:32:14] God
[1:32:16] diverted leave
[1:32:19] something because I say I'll preach
[1:32:26] it but it
[1:32:31] is I said divert him a
[1:32:37] bit does not
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:41] enter and uh
[1:32:44] but God could not
[1:32:48] divert but uh who can recall the the
[1:32:55] subject
[1:32:57] Now this Syria who can recall the
[1:33:00] subject will last overnight his
[1:33:09] message.
[1:33:14] Yes to
[1:33:18] church. Ah my God. Brother Martin is
[1:33:22] around. Perhaps he can remind us the
[1:33:25] subject.
[1:33:28] I won't tell you to.
[1:33:34] Yes. The jubilee.
[1:33:39] Yes. The year of
[1:33:42] jubilee. That's God bless
[1:33:44] you. Amen. But I have another
[1:33:49] approach and not of
[1:33:52] jubilee but some things which were part
[1:33:56] of what he had
[1:34:00] preached also. God had given me the same
[1:34:03] thing some time
[1:34:06] back. So I could try to leave
[1:34:09] it but God you could
[1:34:12] say give this
[1:34:16] yes I want to talk about there is no
[1:34:19] summit to God's
[1:34:26] power there is no summit to God's
[1:34:33] power reached the hilltop of
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:39] There's no more can go
[1:34:42] up. There's no summit to God's
[1:34:47] plan. We were coming with brother Shem
[1:34:50] today at
[1:34:52] night and I looked
[1:34:55] outside. No, I saw
[1:34:57] cows. You know they tie them their
[1:35:01] horns with
[1:35:03] ropes and up on the bars of the art
[1:35:09] roll. The cow has to be just be like
[1:35:14] this till it gets where they
[1:35:18] going. I felt pity for the
[1:35:21] cow because it was really really
[1:35:24] terrible
[1:35:25] thing. Then I thought
[1:35:29] Can you imagine that? Same thing happens
[1:35:32] to
[1:35:34] people. The devil gets
[1:35:37] them, ties them
[1:35:39] well, and he takes
[1:35:43] them. They can't
[1:35:45] shake. They can't
[1:35:47] move. Just like an
[1:35:50] animal. Just like an animal.
[1:35:54] That's why the prophet say a man without
[1:35:57] the holy
[1:35:59] spirit is worse than a
[1:36:03] beast you may not say see
[1:36:06] that if you have never been in the
[1:36:10] world brethren I tell
[1:36:13] you you can be worse I was like worse
[1:36:17] than a
[1:36:20] beast I said what is saying is very
[1:36:25] True. He can do wickedly than what a
[1:36:28] beast can
[1:36:32] do. But we thank God that the power of
[1:36:36] God which is
[1:36:39] unlimited can defeat the power of
[1:36:42] God and can set such
[1:36:46] free. It cannot be explained. It can't
[1:36:50] be explained.
[1:36:53] Starting it off from this point,
[1:36:55] brothers and
[1:36:57] sisters, brethren, often
[1:37:02] times the brethren take a hold of
[1:37:05] something
[1:37:08] good, something good and
[1:37:11] real. And it is
[1:37:13] true. And they always want to conclude
[1:37:18] that this is all of it.
[1:37:24] when it's not
[1:37:27] so sometimes the
[1:37:29] people get onto one
[1:37:33] side and no problem said in a message
[1:37:38] Hebrews watch the
[1:37:40] people when they
[1:37:43] believe if they are
[1:37:49] learn educated
[1:37:53] If you don't
[1:37:55] watch and you are not watchful in
[1:37:59] prayer, they become
[1:38:07] radicals,
[1:38:11] hard
[1:38:13] rough, hard to deal
[1:38:17] with. And if they are and they are not
[1:38:23] well taught in the
[1:38:27] word they will become
[1:38:34] fanatic. He said the way is in the
[1:38:40] middle. So sometimes the people get on
[1:38:43] to one
[1:38:46] side and they say
[1:38:49] This is the
[1:38:50] approach to God's
[1:38:54] word. Anything out of this is
[1:38:59] wrong. And they set an unscriptural
[1:39:07] boundary.
[1:39:09] But there is diverse approaches.
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:21] diverse approaches to God's
[1:39:24] word, the same spirit
[1:39:28] of God is a God of
[1:39:31] diversity and God is a God
[1:39:39] of sometimes the people will
[1:39:43] say it ought to come from
[1:39:47] us from our
[1:39:49] group or else it is
[1:39:53] wrong.
[1:39:55] Lord, we saw
[1:39:58] someone casting out a
[1:40:00] devil in your name, but he's not one
[1:40:07] of Should we stop
[1:40:12] him? He said, "No. Anyone who is not
[1:40:15] against
[1:40:17] us is for us.
[1:40:24] The people put
[1:40:27] limitations and they end up with a
[1:40:30] denominational mindset.
[1:40:36] They end up with a denominational
[1:40:41] mindset but sitting under a true
[1:40:45] church. Can you imagine sitting where
[1:40:49] the true word of God is
[1:40:52] preached but because you have made up
[1:40:55] your
[1:40:56] mind in some other
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:00] way make for yourself a denominational
[1:41:05] mind then the true word will not have
[1:41:08] any impact
[1:41:11] on
[1:41:13] people living in the
[1:41:17] unchanged
[1:41:18] lives. It's okay not to be changed
[1:41:23] today. But there has to be a change
[1:41:27] somewhere. It doesn't have to come from
[1:41:31] you. It has to come from the Lord by the
[1:41:35] word that you listen
[1:41:37] to. It comes to a
[1:41:40] point that it comes to a
[1:41:42] point that the people
[1:41:45] pray but the way they approach
[1:41:49] God the prayer does not break
[1:41:53] through it's the
[1:42:05] mindset yes the
[1:42:07] mindset or you approach to
[1:42:10] God. Yes, we say you are
[1:42:13] free but your mind is
[1:42:16] bound yet
[1:42:18] free. You don't know how to approach
[1:42:22] him and how to respond after
[1:42:27] him, how to act after prayer.
[1:42:32] to do after
[1:42:34] prayer then you don't get the
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:38] answer brothers and
[1:42:40] sisters what I'm saying is this don't
[1:42:44] put
[1:42:46] limitations to
[1:42:48] God how you know
[1:42:50] him how things ought to
[1:42:54] come has to come from us this
[1:42:57] one it has to come from
[1:43:00] me it has to come from so and so. It
[1:43:03] doesn't have to come from
[1:43:05] you. It doesn't have to come from
[1:43:08] me. It doesn't have to come from
[1:43:12] anybody. It has to come from
[1:43:16] God. We are Bible
[1:43:20] believers. Let us act like Bible
[1:43:25] believer. We are Bible believers.
[1:43:29] We speak where the Bible
[1:43:32] speaks. We keep quiet where the Bible is
[1:43:37] quiet. The prophet says that is the
[1:43:42] bride. That is the
[1:43:45] bride. Speaks where the Bible
[1:43:48] speaks and is silent where the
[1:43:51] Bible. If God said
[1:43:54] so, that settles
[1:43:59] it. We have an unlimited
[1:44:04] God with unlimited
[1:44:08] power. You
[1:44:11] cannot you
[1:44:13] cannot you
[1:44:16] cannot put God in a circle.
[1:44:24] And he said that's where he is ought to
[1:44:29] be. It's a crime for
[1:44:32] you to reduce
[1:44:35] God. A man made
[1:44:40] idea. Don't define
[1:44:43] God by your definition.
[1:44:47] No,
[1:44:49] you will not be able to get from him.
[1:44:57] When you define him by your
[1:45:01] definition, you will become a limited
[1:45:05] God because your mind is
[1:45:09] limited. The word is what defines
[1:45:13] God. It is the absolute definition.
[1:45:18] who God
[1:45:22] is. The Bible says God is in the
[1:45:24] Catholic
[1:45:27] church. The Anglican church says God is
[1:45:30] in the Anglican
[1:45:31] church. The Muslim says God is in the
[1:45:36] church. But God is in his
[1:45:39] word. And that's what defines
[1:45:43] God. And what proves that is in his
[1:45:45] word.
[1:45:48] is the evidence of the
[1:45:51] result. We must have
[1:45:55] facts of our
[1:46:00] faith of our
[1:46:02] faith which is the
[1:46:04] result of what we believe.
[1:46:08] cannot let go of
[1:46:10] the We cannot let
[1:46:14] go of
[1:46:16] Christianity. It's the life that we have
[1:46:20] tested and seen and known and it can't
[1:46:25] be taken
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:28] away in the message hidden
[1:46:33] life. He was talking about a hidden life
[1:46:36] with the Christ.
[1:46:38] life that in
[1:46:43] Christ. I loved the
[1:46:46] message. I am but a
[1:46:51] man. But not just a
[1:46:54] man, a man under a divine.
[1:47:01] just a
[1:47:02] man with a human
[1:47:06] element but because of the divine
[1:47:11] assignment I live a divine
[1:47:14] life. No no no not yet I not I not I but
[1:47:19] Christ that
[1:47:21] liveth. He says in the message hidden
[1:47:24] life.
[1:47:26] And now when the brethren received the
[1:47:31] baptism, they said, "This is the
[1:47:36] summit. This is all of
[1:47:39] it."
[1:47:41] But that's
[1:47:43] wrong.
[1:47:44] See, there is no summit to God's power.
[1:47:50] We move
[1:47:52] on and on.
[1:48:00] It's the unlimited
[1:48:04] resources of
[1:48:06] God has never been tapped yet.
[1:48:13] blessings and
[1:48:15] power that we know nothing
[1:48:19] about. It has never been even revealed
[1:48:22] to arch
[1:48:25] angels. It's laying just ahead for his
[1:48:31] church that will
[1:48:36] believe for his church that will
[1:48:38] believe.
[1:48:41] It's not that there isn't
[1:48:43] anymore. It's because your faith has
[1:48:45] come to an
[1:48:48] end. There is
[1:48:50] more. If you can let
[1:48:53] loose, let
[1:48:55] loose. Why do you fear release your
[1:49:00] faith? For eye has not
[1:49:04] seen, ear has not
[1:49:06] heard, neither has it entered the hearts
[1:49:09] of men.
[1:49:12] What God has for them
[1:49:15] is that love
[1:49:18] him. The love of
[1:49:21] God constrains
[1:49:23] us to believe
[1:49:27] God. So let us move
[1:49:31] up and claim our
[1:49:34] rights as God opens the gates.
[1:49:39] He says when you
[1:49:41] move, God
[1:49:45] opens, you
[1:49:46] move, he opens
[1:49:49] the move, he opens
[1:49:54] the swings
[1:49:56] out the welcome
[1:50:01] m. Welcome my
[1:50:04] daughter. Welcome my son.
[1:50:07] I have waited for so
[1:50:09] long for you to get to this
[1:50:13] system. You have it is you
[1:50:17] that was supposed to come
[1:50:20] [Applause]
[1:50:22] here. He said
[1:50:25] John, have you seen the seven church
[1:50:29] ages things that will be through the
[1:50:33] ages? That's wonderful.
[1:50:37] But come up
[1:50:39] higher. Come up
[1:50:41] higher. I show you things that shall be
[1:50:46] here. What I've known, I thought what
[1:50:49] John knew about the church is
[1:50:53] okay. God says, uh, I want to show you
[1:50:57] also things that shall be
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:01] here, but first come up here.
[1:51:07] Let us move
[1:51:09] up into deeper
[1:51:13] depth and never colonize
[1:51:18] ourselves and organize
[1:51:22] ourselves and to get to a
[1:51:25] place where we believe this and that's
[1:51:31] all. He says don't get to that.
[1:51:36] Yes, I believe this. I
[1:51:38] believe that's
[1:51:41] all. He says, "Let us believe
[1:51:45] this." He said, "What you believe is all
[1:51:48] right. Let us believe
[1:51:51] this.
[1:51:54] Plus, how much more we can hear from
[1:51:59] God.
[1:52:03] Let us believe
[1:52:05] this.
[1:52:08] Plus, how much
[1:52:11] more we can
[1:52:14] hear from
[1:52:19] God. You know
[1:52:22] something,
[1:52:25] but hear something
[1:52:27] else from God. The problem
[1:52:31] is you know
[1:52:33] something but you want to what what you
[1:52:35] want to
[1:52:38] plus you are not hearing it from
[1:52:43] God. You are hearing it from a false
[1:52:48] shepherd
[1:52:50] shepherds outside the
[1:52:53] message. That's what you want to add on
[1:52:56] the message.
[1:52:59] You want the
[1:53:00] message
[1:53:02] plus a denominational
[1:53:05] teaching message plus the
[1:53:07] word the message plus my
[1:53:13] mindset plus what you can hear from
[1:53:18] God. I think that ought to be the ne the
[1:53:22] motive of every man.
[1:53:28] and woman that loves the Lord
[1:53:32] Jesus to receive all
[1:53:36] that you
[1:53:40] can to receive
[1:53:43] all
[1:53:45] that you
[1:53:49] can say according to the
[1:53:53] power that works in
[1:53:57] us because the
[1:54:00] grace he said is
[1:54:03] different to every
[1:54:05] [Music]
[1:54:06] man. But what you can
[1:54:09] receive from the Lord, receive
[1:54:14] it from the hand of his bountful
[1:54:19] mercy. That's my
[1:54:22] heart. That's the reason
[1:54:25] I never joined any
[1:54:28] organization or took sides with any
[1:54:33] group. The prophet says take sides with
[1:54:39] Jesus
[1:54:41] because I wanted
[1:54:45] myself wide
[1:54:48] open for the love of
[1:54:51] God for what he could give.
[1:54:57] Every
[1:54:59] time you choose to group
[1:55:04] yourself outside the word of
[1:55:09] God, you are closing the
[1:55:13] door to God's love.
[1:55:19] You are closing the
[1:55:21] door to
[1:55:25] God's. Remember
[1:55:28] this and don't forget
[1:55:32] it.
[1:55:35] God, you don't have to ask
[1:55:40] God to come in your group.
[1:55:46] It's you to come out of
[1:55:51] your and come to
[1:55:55] God. There is no
[1:56:00] summit to God's
[1:56:03] power. It's you that has come to the
[1:56:08] summit. You should think and
[1:56:12] feels that you have come to the
[1:56:20] hilltop.
[1:56:22] Brethren, this God that we are
[1:56:26] serving is the
[1:56:28] God that rules in
[1:56:33] nature. He rules nature.
[1:56:38] He rules in the affairs of
[1:56:42] men. He rises the
[1:56:47] sun. He wakes it
[1:56:50] up and he sets the
[1:56:54] sun and he hides
[1:56:57] it from one place and shining in another
[1:57:02] place. What a mighty God we see.
[1:57:07] He reigns rain in one
[1:57:10] place, closes the heavens in one
[1:57:14] place. One time I read a scripture in
[1:57:17] Isaiah which says it speaks to the
[1:57:22] clouds through the
[1:57:25] thunder to release the
[1:57:32] rain. I said I didn't know
[1:57:35] You're going to hear the
[1:57:37] thundering. It's the voice of God.
[1:57:43] You may not believe
[1:57:45] it,
[1:57:48] but I believe it.
[1:57:52] He holds the orbits of the earth.
[1:57:58] Could you imagine?
[1:58:00] We can lift you upside
[1:58:03] down but the soul will not pour
[1:58:09] out the soul
[1:58:12] within. Could you imagine the doctor can
[1:58:16] cut
[1:58:17] you the soul will not
[1:58:25] come. But let God
[1:58:31] Call that soul
[1:58:33] out that body remain on that.
[1:58:40] Who can define for
[1:58:43] me such a
[1:58:46] God? Who can bring for
[1:58:49] me a God greater than all God?
[1:58:53] Who can tell
[1:58:54] me that this
[1:58:57] God can't do anything?
[1:59:06] Abraham, is anything too hard for the
[1:59:11] Lord? Child of
[1:59:16] God, have no fear.
[1:59:24] There's a song we
[1:59:27] sing. I won't be
[1:59:30] shaken. I won't be
[1:59:33] more. My God is
[1:59:36] faithful. My God is
[1:59:39] able. Greater than
[1:59:44] you. He holds your soul within.
[1:59:48] [Music]
[1:59:51] It cannot
[1:59:53] escape. David said, "You have surrounded
[1:59:57] me with the
[2:00:00] bones."
[2:00:02] Meaning was on the
[2:00:05] inside surrounded with the
[2:00:07] bones. And he said, "You have given me
[2:00:11] this
[2:00:12] body as a house of my priv.
[2:00:20] I am just in this
[2:00:24] border. But one
[2:00:27] day,
[2:00:29] someday God only knows
[2:00:32] just the wheels of mortal
[2:00:35] life shall all stand
[2:00:41] still to dwell on Zion's hill.
[2:00:46] I will see him
[2:00:48] outside. I'll see him. I will see him.
[2:00:52] I'll see him who saved my
[2:00:56] soul. I'll see
[2:00:59] him. The bones won't hold my
[2:01:02] soul. My body won't hold my
[2:01:06] soul, but I'll see my
[2:01:09] God. Some glad
[2:01:13] morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:18] Tell me which kind of people
[2:01:22] that have the
[2:01:24] hope that a Christian
[2:01:28] has they can
[2:01:30] speak but they know in the heart they
[2:01:34] don't have
[2:01:37] that. Maybe you are here in the
[2:01:39] church. You talk about
[2:01:43] it, but you know you don't have
[2:01:47] it. You don't have to be that
[2:01:51] way. You can have it
[2:01:56] today. You can have
[2:02:01] it. His power is unlimited.
[2:02:06] And I believe
[2:02:08] God every level you get
[2:02:12] to with
[2:02:14] God, it becomes the
[2:02:17] beginning of a new
[2:02:19] [Music]
[2:02:26] beginning. Do you think you feel you
[2:02:28] have come to a certain
[2:02:31] level? It's a beginning of another.
[2:02:35] Our prophet preached a message. The
[2:02:39] power of God and he said the power of
[2:02:41] Satan is
[2:02:44] limited. The power of God is
[2:02:48] unlimited. I believe
[2:02:54] God. Do you want to be
[2:02:58] well? Is your soul troubled?
[2:03:03] Is your spiritual life
[2:03:07] dying? Are you
[2:03:10] stagnant? Spiritual
[2:03:15] stagnant economically
[2:03:19] stagnant mater.
[2:03:34] No matter your
[2:03:38] case, we all want to be
[2:03:42] well. Everyone wants to be
[2:03:45] well. We want to be
[2:03:49] better than who we are today.
[2:03:53] There's no
[2:03:54] person, no
[2:03:57] person sinner or
[2:03:59] saint that comes to
[2:04:02] church without a
[2:04:06] problem. No
[2:04:08] sir, whether they believe
[2:04:11] God and they are real
[2:04:13] Christians, whether they are make
[2:04:15] believers, whether they are
[2:04:17] unbelievers, whoever comes to
[2:04:20] church has a problem.
[2:04:29] The difference
[2:04:31] is some get the answer of the
[2:04:34] problem and don't get the
[2:04:37] God who solve the
[2:04:40] problem. Others get the
[2:04:43] answer and get
[2:04:46] God. Others don't get the
[2:04:51] answer. Everyone gets the answer. All
[2:04:54] their problem
[2:04:56] remains and they get
[2:04:59] God. Now it is
[2:05:02] impossible for someone that has
[2:05:05] got for their problem to
[2:05:08] remain. Amen. That's why I don't
[2:05:14] believe when you
[2:05:17] say someone is doing well spiritually.
[2:05:23] But
[2:05:24] physically they won't do
[2:05:29] well. How can it
[2:05:32] be?
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:36] Spiritually
[2:05:38] spiritually it means you are you are
[2:05:41] well with the Bible.
[2:05:45] This is a spiritual
[2:05:47] word and addresses physical things.
[2:05:52] I'm not
[2:05:54] afraid when I get my life. Let me leave
[2:05:59] that now for
[2:06:00] now. In the message, the angel of the
[2:06:02] Lord, he
[2:06:03] says, now look, the angel of God, he
[2:06:06] says, now
[2:06:07] look, we are all
[2:06:10] here. We want to be
[2:06:15] well. And the more deeper
[2:06:19] He gives the solution. The more deeper
[2:06:22] you get into
[2:06:25] this, the better off you are going to
[2:06:30] be. Amen.
[2:06:33] The more deeper you get into
[2:06:36] this, the better off you are going
[2:06:39] to unlimited
[2:06:44] resources. If you need
[2:06:46] capital for your business,
[2:06:49] God has a
[2:06:51] resource for
[2:06:54] capital. If you need
[2:06:56] material for making your
[2:07:00] clothes to for making clothes to put
[2:07:03] on or to
[2:07:05] sell. God has a
[2:07:08] resource to supply that.
[2:07:12] If you need money for missionary
[2:07:16] work, there is a
[2:07:18] resource to provide for that because God
[2:07:23] when he set his children
[2:07:26] upon he put
[2:07:29] resources for them to do
[2:07:34] everything to meet the divine
[2:07:38] duty. I love that.
[2:07:43] It all comes
[2:07:47] supernaturally from a supernatural
[2:07:50] God to a
[2:07:54] supernatural. When you
[2:07:56] go to supernatural
[2:07:59] person and everything you receive
[2:08:02] from you receive it
[2:08:06] supernaturally. I
[2:08:08] believe in being helped
[2:08:12] and helping
[2:08:14] others but not in
[2:08:17] begging. I don't believe in
[2:08:20] that. I believe that God can send you
[2:08:26] destiny
[2:08:31] helpers. He won't change the
[2:08:35] destiny. It is already set.
[2:08:41] But he will send destiny
[2:08:47] help to get you to the
[2:08:50] destiny. I believe in that
[2:08:53] [Music]
[2:08:54] also. But I do not believe that you
[2:08:58] should
[2:08:59] accept that you are
[2:09:05] defeated. You become a beggar.
[2:09:11] There was a little
[2:09:14] child during the day of
[2:09:18] brother. The little lad was
[2:09:22] blind. She was a
[2:09:25] girl. She was
[2:09:27] blind. She came to the meeting of
[2:09:29] brother.
[2:09:32] But that
[2:09:36] time
[2:09:38] brother the people were too many.
[2:09:41] Everyone wanted to get
[2:09:43] there for too many. Everyone wanted to
[2:09:45] get
[2:09:46] to but they wanted him to get some
[2:09:51] rest. So he had to go through the
[2:09:54] people. He had to go through the people.
[2:09:57] As he was going
[2:09:59] through, going through disguising
[2:10:02] himself, disguising
[2:10:05] himself, he had a
[2:10:08] voice. He was attracted by a certain
[2:10:12] voice of a little
[2:10:16] child. She
[2:10:18] cried, "My daddy,
[2:10:21] my daddy. Where's my daddy?
[2:10:25] I can't
[2:10:29] find and
[2:10:35] babe then he came he came he
[2:10:37] came so she said my
[2:10:42] daddy where's my
[2:10:44] daddy and he looked at the
[2:10:47] girl she was
[2:10:49] blind he realized she was
[2:10:52] blind he said, "Little little
[2:10:56] child, what have you come here
[2:10:58] for in this great
[2:11:01] multitude?" She said, "I've come to see
[2:11:04] the
[2:11:06] healer." A little
[2:11:08] child. Hallelujah. Can you get me to the
[2:11:14] healer? Are you the
[2:11:17] healer? He said,
[2:11:19] "What? What have you come
[2:11:22] for? I've come to see the
[2:11:26] healer. Amen. He said, "Did you believe
[2:11:29] such
[2:11:31] things like
[2:11:33] that?" Said,
[2:11:35] "Yes, I
[2:11:39] believe."
[2:11:42] Amen. Was defeated.
[2:11:50] She said,
[2:11:51] "Sir, if you can, do you know where the
[2:11:54] hill
[2:11:55] is? If you can only get me
[2:12:01] today, I will find my
[2:12:05] daddy." Amen. Then Jesus
[2:12:09] said, "I've not seen such a faith in
[2:12:12] Israel.
[2:12:17] Such a
[2:12:21] faith. If you can only get me to the
[2:12:26] healer, I will find my
[2:12:32] dad. In other
[2:12:34] words, if you get me to the
[2:12:37] healer, I'll get my sight. Hallelujah.
[2:12:42] You won't have to look for my dad.
[2:12:46] You won't have to look for for my
[2:12:49] dad. I will seek for
[2:12:52] him. You can only get
[2:12:56] me and he just lifts my
[2:13:00] step and take me to give me the
[2:13:05] foundation. Trust
[2:13:07] me, I will
[2:13:09] build and build and put the rooftop.
[2:13:16] and
[2:13:17] enter. What a believer
[2:13:21] needs is a helping
[2:13:24] hand that can take
[2:13:27] them and put them where they want
[2:13:32] to get what they
[2:13:37] want. You will get it for yourself once
[2:13:40] you reach.
[2:13:42] Hallelujah.
[2:13:44] A
[2:13:45] believer is not someone that you
[2:13:48] help. You reach an
[2:13:51] extent and you reach an extent and
[2:13:54] really you are
[2:13:56] defeated. Things have beaten you. You
[2:13:59] can't no more support this
[2:14:05] posture and they hate
[2:14:09] you. That's not what a believer will do.
[2:14:14] A believer
[2:14:16] understands that you a man you can
[2:14:20] fail but their faith is in
[2:14:27] God. The
[2:14:29] believer the far you have took
[2:14:34] them the far where you took
[2:14:37] them and you reached the end.
[2:14:41] No, trust
[2:14:43] me. They are able to get to their
[2:14:48] dream able to achieve
[2:14:53] their when I was in my senior
[2:14:56] six. I finished my own
[2:15:00] level. I could not I reached I went to A
[2:15:03] level. I did senior five. Everything was
[2:15:07] messed up.
[2:15:09] at home and things failed. Poverty
[2:15:13] struck to the to the
[2:15:16] least and my father became very
[2:15:22] poor. There I
[2:15:25] fell. It was so
[2:15:29] unbelievable. But that was the only way
[2:15:31] God could pull me
[2:15:34] to because I
[2:15:36] cried. I reached the
[2:15:42] end. I tried started prayer and
[2:15:47] fast. One day they sent me to a certain
[2:15:49] woman's
[2:15:52] home. Be humble. My uncle sent
[2:15:56] me and
[2:15:58] get that home. I brought it with that
[2:16:02] aunt. Give you that ch because we went
[2:16:04] together. I brought also
[2:16:07] So you go and get some, bring
[2:16:11] home. When I went there, I got the
[2:16:14] charco as she I packed. I got the
[2:16:18] charcoal with my free hands. I packed I
[2:16:23] packed and greeted
[2:16:25] everyone. I didn't ask for
[2:16:27] water. I just brought my
[2:16:30] check, started going, said, "Oh, no, no,
[2:16:34] no, no. I've not given him
[2:16:37] water and please give him
[2:16:41] water. And by the way, why are you
[2:16:47] home? And I started
[2:16:52] say she said, "Oh, let me see what I can
[2:16:59] do." And she called.
[2:17:04] She first gave me about
[2:17:08] 250. The 50 use it for
[2:17:12] yourself. But that money was the
[2:17:17] data. So I paid I live there a few days.
[2:17:19] They
[2:17:24] ch I got a
[2:17:29] full I got a full
[2:17:31] bus from nowhere.
[2:17:37] And at school they thought I'm executive
[2:17:39] you
[2:17:41] know because when they give
[2:17:46] notes I just give they take she
[2:17:52] takes she
[2:17:56] gives they said ah rich
[2:17:59] child but I was just a prophet
[2:18:03] It was just
[2:18:06] God. Towards the exams, the final
[2:18:11] exam
[2:18:13] problems, she had many children take
[2:18:15] care
[2:18:16] of. She told me I cannot pay money for
[2:18:21] your tried to call the family member.
[2:18:25] They
[2:18:27] gather. I thought, man, I'm stuck now.
[2:18:33] back to the
[2:18:34] hall. So I said, "What can I
[2:18:37] do?" Somehow
[2:18:39] I didn't get hungry. I was thankful what
[2:18:42] she
[2:18:44] did and I got the money I paid
[2:18:47] off. She told me, "I have reached the
[2:18:51] end there.
[2:18:53] Someone
[2:18:54] else will take you from
[2:18:57] there and take you to an
[2:19:01] institution and take you to an
[2:19:06] institute. Now I did believe that I
[2:19:09] didn't like it because I didn't want an
[2:19:12] institute. I went to the
[2:19:16] university.
[2:19:17] But what she said is what happened.
[2:19:24] I got
[2:19:28] someone and I was able to go and I went
[2:19:31] to an
[2:19:33] institute and did a diploma.
[2:19:38] So what am I saying? Get a believer
[2:19:41] somewhere.
[2:19:43] They will be able to reach the
[2:19:46] goal. They won't be
[2:19:48] angry. We have unlimited
[2:19:52] grace, unlimited
[2:19:54] love in God. It goes far
[2:19:59] deeper, deeper beyond
[2:20:04] what unlimited
[2:20:07] inspiration. It goes far
[2:20:09] deeper to the deep things of God.
[2:20:13] A man can be so
[2:20:16] inspired till he speaks the very
[2:20:21] mind. The Bible says in second Peter
[2:20:25] 1:21 there is no
[2:20:27] scripture that is of private
[2:20:32] interpretation. that holy men of
[2:20:35] God spoke as they were moved by the Holy
[2:20:39] Ghost. They were so
[2:20:42] inspired till what they
[2:20:45] spoke became the
[2:20:47] scripture. Brother, sister, you can be
[2:20:51] so
[2:20:52] inspired, when you speak the word, it
[2:20:55] becomes the
[2:20:57] scripture. Amen. There is a spirit in a
[2:21:00] man.
[2:21:02] The Bible says there is a spirit in a
[2:21:04] man and the inspiration of the
[2:21:08] Almighty gives them
[2:21:11] understanding. God comes and
[2:21:14] inspires the spirit in the mind and
[2:21:18] gives you
[2:21:20] understanding of the word. That's what
[2:21:23] brings the
[2:21:24] Christ in the kingdom of darkness.
[2:21:28] That's what brings a
[2:21:29] crisis in the kingdom of
[2:21:32] darkness. Brothers and sisters
[2:21:37] um you
[2:21:39] cannot put a
[2:21:42] summit God's
[2:21:47] power. It goes on and
[2:21:50] on limited revelation.
[2:21:54] Brothers and
[2:21:55] sisters, many have preached
[2:21:58] this since the world
[2:22:01] began, but it is still not yet
[2:22:08] done. Amen.
[2:22:11] Could you
[2:22:13] imagine they have breached this little
[2:22:16] book
[2:22:18] since the ages
[2:22:20] [Music]
[2:22:21] become but it is not yet
[2:22:24] done? What manner of book is
[2:22:28] this? The unlimited word of
[2:22:32] God. The more they preach
[2:22:35] it, the more it expands.
[2:22:39] It becomes a new
[2:22:41] book. That's why you can get a
[2:22:45] sermon from a
[2:22:47] sermon and another preacher get a sermon
[2:22:51] out of that and another and
[2:22:55] another limited
[2:22:58] revelation. Preach the word. It will
[2:23:02] increase hearts of the people. We don't
[2:23:05] have to say too much. The little we say
[2:23:09] God
[2:23:10] expanded in your life. Brother says the
[2:23:15] Bible became a new book. When the seals
[2:23:18] were
[2:23:18] open even before the seals were
[2:23:21] open, what he preached was
[2:23:24] true. The longer you study the
[2:23:27] Bible, the deeper it
[2:23:30] gets. You can
[2:23:32] never exhaust it.
[2:23:36] It's you that has got exhausted.
[2:23:42] Well, I've read your
[2:23:44] Genesis all
[2:23:47] through. Go back and read
[2:23:50] again. You will see as if you didn't
[2:23:56] read. Something
[2:23:58] new comes up yet not
[2:24:02] new, but it was there.
[2:24:06] But it
[2:24:08] says, "I have still a lot of things to
[2:24:11] tell
[2:24:12] you, I still have a lot to
[2:24:15] do, but you can't bear them
[2:24:19] all. It don't need
[2:24:23] editing. The
[2:24:25] scripture doesn't need
[2:24:28] editing or a new other Bible."
[2:24:34] No, this old one, it still
[2:24:38] works. Unlimited
[2:24:41] anointing, a man can be so
[2:24:44] anointed till we speak things into
[2:24:49] existence.
[2:24:50] Amen. A man can be
[2:24:54] so speak what is in your
[2:24:57] heart. A man can be so
[2:25:00] anointed until the anointing breaks the
[2:25:05] lawed
[2:25:08] revival at Pentecost.
[2:25:11] It was a
[2:25:12] revival. If I go back in the days of
[2:25:15] Moses, there was a
[2:25:17] revival. God wasn't limited. And at
[2:25:22] Pentecost, he said, "I'll pour out my
[2:25:25] spirit. It was a revival.
[2:25:28] But God didn't stop
[2:25:32] there. It was a revival. But God didn't
[2:25:36] stop there. At Welsh, there was a Welsh
[2:25:41] revival. But God didn't
[2:25:43] stop. He added another
[2:25:46] revival. The layman is
[2:25:49] revival. The layman is
[2:25:51] revival. And
[2:25:54] revival. Another revival.
[2:25:57] another
[2:25:59] now. If you need
[2:26:03] another one, if you
[2:26:07] need, it's getting on. It's going on.
[2:26:12] Just get on
[2:26:13] board. The revival is
[2:26:15] on of the end time
[2:26:19] message because the end time
[2:26:22] message end time
[2:26:24] conditions. Hallelujah. When the enemy
[2:26:28] rises against us like a
[2:26:30] flood shall raise his
[2:26:33] hand against the
[2:26:35] enemy the end time message and the end
[2:26:38] time
[2:26:40] messenger of the end time
[2:26:44] message end
[2:26:48] conditions and defeat the end time
[2:26:53] conditions
[2:26:54] standard that is
[2:26:57] unlimited to a believer. It is the power
[2:27:01] that is unlimited to a believer. It is
[2:27:05] God that's
[2:27:07] unlimited. This
[2:27:09] message is like a wild
[2:27:13] fire. It's like a wild
[2:27:16] fire is burning within my
[2:27:18] heart. It sets off and it burns up all
[2:27:23] over. But when it burns,
[2:27:26] it cannot
[2:27:27] leave the chaff in
[2:27:32] you. Amen. This is the fire of
[2:27:34] God that can cleans it.
[2:27:38] The call of
[2:27:40] fire. When the call of
[2:27:42] fire touched the prophet, it made him
[2:27:47] pure as pure can
[2:27:49] be a friend. May the callers of fire of
[2:27:55] the word of
[2:27:57] God within your
[2:28:01] heart. It's all over me. It's all over
[2:28:05] me and it is keeping me up.
[2:28:09] It's the word of God. It is the spirit
[2:28:12] of God that keeps the
[2:28:15] believer
[2:28:17] alive in the service of God. We have
[2:28:21] unlimited
[2:28:23] intelligence. Unlimited
[2:28:26] intelligence that can
[2:28:28] discern the secrets of the heart. You
[2:28:31] will not be like the
[2:28:33] prophet but by the pro by the by by the
[2:28:36] inspiration of
[2:28:38] You know that the
[2:28:41] preacher spoke my
[2:28:43] life. The search
[2:28:46] engine when God came to brother
[2:28:50] pron you think it is you who designs the
[2:28:54] secrets of the
[2:28:55] heart. It is me the pillar of fire. The
[2:29:00] spirit of God is our
[2:29:04] intelligence. We have unlimited wisdom.
[2:29:08] Trust in the Lord. Trust in the Lord
[2:29:11] with all your heart and lean not on him.
[2:29:17] Man's wisdom comes to an end. Science
[2:29:21] science is
[2:29:23] limited. AI is limited. Artificial
[2:29:27] intelligence. Science is artificial.
[2:29:32] Science have a supernatural
[2:29:34] intelligence.
[2:29:37] A
[2:29:38] combination, a
[2:29:40] combination of men's
[2:29:42] thoughts is artificial
[2:29:45] intelligence. And where they end, that's
[2:29:48] where God
[2:29:49] starts. Man's wisdom has always failed
[2:29:54] and it will fail because it is
[2:29:57] limited. In your
[2:29:59] trouble, don't use your wisdom. Let me
[2:30:02] apply.
[2:30:04] Let me apply the word of
[2:30:10] God. Brother, sister, you have
[2:30:14] tried. You have tried did your
[2:30:19] efforts and things have failed to
[2:30:23] work. Let me also
[2:30:25] try by the word and we see whether they
[2:30:30] won't work.
[2:30:31] yours failed. If you tried your
[2:30:35] tricks up here and
[2:30:39] there
[2:30:42] right past
[2:30:44] well, but you have failed to get
[2:30:48] through. Allow me to take what and say
[2:30:54] you will make it. You will get through
[2:30:57] it. You will get
[2:30:59] there. A man,
[2:31:02] a man in his
[2:31:04] senses is limited to his
[2:31:09] senses. But a man in his
[2:31:12] spirit is
[2:31:15] unlimited. The spirit of the last
[2:31:19] day. Science. Science has drove man into
[2:31:24] the spirit of the last science.
[2:31:32] robots change man into a
[2:31:36] woman. The spirit of the last
[2:31:39] day and it is the wisdom of
[2:31:42] men that has driven them to the judgment
[2:31:45] of
[2:31:47] God then it won't work.
[2:31:51] But we are trying our
[2:31:54] best by God's grace to drive his
[2:32:00] children of
[2:32:02] God to drive the children of God into
[2:32:06] the last day
[2:32:09] promise to the
[2:32:11] church.
[2:32:13] But something seems to hinder.
[2:32:19] Nevertheless, we are bound to break
[2:32:22] through unlimited signs and
[2:32:26] wonders. If he did them
[2:32:28] yesterday, he does them today and
[2:32:32] tomorrow and
[2:32:34] forever. God can do a
[2:32:38] miracle
[2:32:41] today. Amen. And he can do it again
[2:32:44] tomorrow.
[2:32:46] and do it the next
[2:32:48] day and the next day and daily in your
[2:32:53] life. He can do
[2:32:56] that. All my
[2:32:59] life, it has been God. All your life, it
[2:33:04] has been God with the finger of
[2:33:07] God. We cast out
[2:33:09] devils. Are you tormented by devils? It
[2:33:13] doesn't take too
[2:33:15] much to cast them all out. Jesus said,
[2:33:20] "If
[2:33:21] I by the finger of
[2:33:24] God, just a
[2:33:27] finger casting out
[2:33:29] devils. It doesn't take too much to cast
[2:33:34] out devils. It takes man and
[2:33:38] woman fully surrendered to
[2:33:42] God brother sister in my
[2:33:46] name s will cast out
[2:33:51] devils man that's fully surrender to
[2:33:54] God is
[2:33:57] unlimited get him into a
[2:34:00] crisis destroy all that
[2:34:03] he will still
[2:34:05] Say, "I know my
[2:34:08] redeemer." You mock
[2:34:11] him. You slap him. Step on his
[2:34:15] toe. You slay him. He will
[2:34:19] say, "Father, forgive
[2:34:22] them. Put him in prison. He will worship
[2:34:26] and praise
[2:34:27] him." Why? He is living above the world.
[2:34:32] He is eternal.
[2:34:36] He is
[2:34:38] unlimited. Put him in the grave. You
[2:34:41] will rise
[2:34:42] again. He is
[2:34:46] unlimited. Unlimited
[2:34:48] faith. You can speak what you
[2:34:51] desire into
[2:34:53] existence. You are only
[2:34:56] controlled by a principle. No. No. Amen.
[2:35:03] You are controlled by the
[2:35:06] principle that faith works by
[2:35:11] love. If you have love, you have
[2:35:15] confidence with
[2:35:16] God. If you have confidence with
[2:35:19] God, then you can have
[2:35:22] faith. Speak your
[2:35:24] desire. For we know that he gives
[2:35:29] us whatever we ask of him because we ask
[2:35:34] according to his
[2:35:36] will looking at the
[2:35:39] unseen. The prophet says, I was told out
[2:35:43] here at Bastofield,
[2:35:47] I believe is what they call it where
[2:35:50] they have these big jet
[2:35:52] planes that the jet plane in its
[2:35:56] travel it goes to a certain
[2:35:59] speed and then it hits what's called the
[2:36:03] sound barrier.
[2:36:09] It it hits what is called sound
[2:36:13] par. And they say that that
[2:36:18] plane
[2:36:20] struggles and
[2:36:22] shakes while it is trying to get through
[2:36:25] that sound barrier.
[2:36:30] It is seem
[2:36:32] like the wings will tear off of
[2:36:36] it and the boats will rip out of
[2:36:40] it while it is going through that
[2:36:44] [Music]
[2:36:45] sound. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:36:48] But when once it gets beyond the
[2:36:54] sound then it's
[2:36:57] speed is
[2:36:59] unlimited. It can just fly
[2:37:06] free and the
[2:37:08] church and you sitting here
[2:37:12] tonight. Tonight
[2:37:18] Oh, you are
[2:37:21] struggling. This is the prophet. He says
[2:37:25] and the
[2:37:26] church you sitting here
[2:37:29] tonight. Oh, you are
[2:37:32] struggling. You are
[2:37:35] struggling and
[2:37:37] struggling and God is pulling to
[2:37:41] you and showing you
[2:37:44] things. If you can ever get past that
[2:37:48] sin
[2:37:52] barrier of
[2:37:54] unbelief, then unlimited
[2:38:00] revival will break
[2:38:02] out through the United States through
[2:38:06] DVF and
[2:38:08] FAV. If you can go
[2:38:11] beyond that sound
[2:38:16] barrier, sound barrier of
[2:38:19] unbelief. You say, "Oh, is it true? Does
[2:38:23] it mean me? Could I be
[2:38:26] healed? Could I be saved? Could I be
[2:38:29] filled with the Holy
[2:38:31] Spirit? Get beyond that.
[2:38:39] How can
[2:38:40] I break through?
[2:38:43] How can I be a weapon
[2:38:48] through? How can me be someone can
[2:38:53] use for someone?
[2:38:56] He says just keep
[2:38:59] struggling,
[2:39:01] struggling and
[2:39:03] struggling until you break
[2:39:06] through and the Holy Ghost comes upon
[2:39:09] you. I am telling you, you are beyond
[2:39:14] it and there is 50 miles of
[2:39:20] room unlimited
[2:39:23] glory. Heaven and earth can't contain
[2:39:25] it.
[2:39:27] That's the glory of our
[2:39:28] God. And we come down in the temple of
[2:39:33] Solomon. Priests could not
[2:39:35] minister because the unlimited God had
[2:39:39] come down and the limited
[2:39:42] men had to be
[2:39:44] silenced. When he come to the
[2:39:47] mountain, the mountain got fire because
[2:39:51] the
[2:39:52] uned had come down.
[2:39:55] Let him come in your
[2:39:57] house. Let him come in your job. Let him
[2:40:00] come in your
[2:40:01] ministry. Let him come in your life. Let
[2:40:05] him come in your
[2:40:06] marriage. Let him come in your
[2:40:09] calling. You can't limit
[2:40:14] God. He can use the poor. He can use the
[2:40:18] rich. He can use the men. He can use the
[2:40:21] women. He can use the boys.
[2:40:26] He is
[2:40:28] unlimited. Unlimited
[2:40:31] mercies new every morning. His
[2:40:35] compassion they cannot fail. Unlimited
[2:40:41] strategies. He is the master
[2:40:45] strategist. He knows how to bring it to
[2:40:48] your testimony. His
[2:40:52] ways are past finding
[2:40:56] out. Don't figure
[2:40:58] out how it will come. Just keep
[2:41:02] looking and it will come. If he
[2:41:07] said, if he said he will
[2:41:10] come, if he said he will be
[2:41:12] there, don't you worry, he will be
[2:41:15] there. Because Jesus keeps all his
[2:41:19] appointments. He's right on
[2:41:22] time. Just wait. Just wait. Child of
[2:41:26] God, just wait. He taught me. He taught
[2:41:30] me how to watch and
[2:41:33] pray. He taught me how to watch and
[2:41:37] pray. Teach me, Lord. Teach me Lord to
[2:41:41] wait down on my
[2:41:43] knees while
[2:41:47] others unlimited
[2:41:49] life. I have come that they may have
[2:41:53] life in
[2:41:55] abundance. It's
[2:41:57] eternal. Unlimited
[2:41:59] provision. It can provide through
[2:42:02] diverse
[2:42:03] ways to be limited. It has to come from
[2:42:07] uncle. It has to come
[2:42:12] from. It has to come from
[2:42:14] brother. It has to come from this
[2:42:17] church. He is
[2:42:19] unlimited. Just a believer and wait upon
[2:42:23] God. When the
[2:42:25] brook runs
[2:42:27] dry, he still has a
[2:42:30] source. When the
[2:42:32] robins could not bring
[2:42:35] bread, it had a source.
[2:42:41] God has no plan
[2:42:43] B over your life. No sir.
[2:42:53] God, I was asking
[2:42:56] this but when I look into
[2:42:59] it looks
[2:43:02] hard.
[2:43:04] Maybe give me this one.
[2:43:08] That's plan
[2:43:11] B. God has no plan
[2:43:13] B over your life. If plan A
[2:43:18] has not
[2:43:20] failed and it will never
[2:43:23] fail or a sister. You are not a second
[2:43:28] choice. You are not a a side
[2:43:32] wife. You are the bride of Christ. God
[2:43:36] is not an a an
[2:43:41] anou. No sir. His love is not
[2:43:45] shared. It's for his bride. You are the
[2:43:49] first
[2:43:50] choice. You are the first
[2:43:52] lady and there is no second
[2:43:55] lady. Therefore, you are not the second
[2:43:59] thought in the thoughts of God. You are
[2:44:02] the first thought.
[2:44:05] the same. Your thoughts over me are
[2:44:11] unnumbered. They are like a sand on a
[2:44:14] [Music]
[2:44:16] seashore. In an unlimited
[2:44:21] economy, in unlimited
[2:44:29] economy that the world things are not
[2:44:33] okay.
[2:44:34] They are okay in
[2:44:36] heaven, without money without price. God
[2:44:41] is a
[2:44:42] favor. God is a favor can buy
[2:44:47] anything in your
[2:44:50] life. Do you need a any feeling of the
[2:44:53] Holy
[2:44:54] Ghost? You can have it now. It's
[2:44:57] unlimited here. It's unlimited here. The
[2:45:01] world says unlimited

[2:45:11] data, but at the end
[2:45:14] of it's
[2:45:19] limited. We have a
[2:45:23] bleed. It's the word of
[2:45:26] God of Jesus. Have you come to the end?
[2:45:31] your
[2:45:32] understanding and you don't know what to
[2:45:34] do. Get off from that tree of your
[2:45:39] wisdom. Start
