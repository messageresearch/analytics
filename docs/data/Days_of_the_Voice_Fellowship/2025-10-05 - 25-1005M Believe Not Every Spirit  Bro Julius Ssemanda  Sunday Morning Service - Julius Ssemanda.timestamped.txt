[1:08:58] we read verse 1 to6.
[1:09:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:07] Beloved,
[1:09:09] believe not every spirit,
[1:09:12] but try the spirits whether they are of
[1:09:15] God,
[1:09:17] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:09:20] into the world.
[1:09:22] Hereby know ye the spirit of God.
[1:09:26] Every spirit that confesses that Jesus
[1:09:28] Christ is come in the flesh is of God.
[1:09:32] And every spirit that confesses not that
[1:09:35] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not
[1:09:37] of God. And this is the spirit of
[1:09:40] Antichrist, whereof you have heard that
[1:09:43] it should come, and even now already is
[1:09:46] it in the world. Ye are of God, little
[1:09:49] children, and have overcome them,
[1:09:52] because greater is he that is in you
[1:09:55] than he that is in the world. So the one
[1:09:58] that overcomes is the one that's on the
[1:10:01] inside. Not one that is, you know, but
[1:10:04] the overcomer is on the inside.
[1:10:09] He says that greater is he that is in
[1:10:11] you
[1:10:14] than he that is in the world. They that
[1:10:17] are of the world, they are of the world.
[1:10:20] Therefore speak they of the world, and
[1:10:23] the world hearth them.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; We are of God. He that knows God hears
[1:10:30] us.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there is no pressure
[1:10:35] there is no worry
[1:10:37] but he that is
[1:10:40] he that is of he that knows God hears
[1:10:44] us.
[1:10:47] He that is not of God he has not us
[1:10:52] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[1:10:54] the spirit of error.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I read.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can interpret.
[1:11:00] for
[1:11:39] forcib.
[1:12:26] Amen. Amen.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Kindly take your seats.
[1:12:31] Shall we bow our heads and pray?
[1:12:35] Dear God,
[1:12:37] We have read out of your word.
[1:12:40] We know that your word is true
[1:12:44] and the Holy Spirit is the witness
[1:12:47] that comes to confirm it to be alive.
[1:12:51] Let it discern the secrets of the heart
[1:12:56] and minister to the needs of your
[1:12:57] people.
[1:13:00] Dear God,
[1:13:02] take the word.
[1:13:05] Break it yourself.
[1:13:08] Let it be real.
[1:13:11] Let it be life.
[1:13:14] Let it transform lives.
[1:13:18] Let it help these people
[1:13:22] myself and my brother
[1:13:25] to come closer to Jesus.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord in Jesus Christ name.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God richly bless you once again.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; We are not going to be too long.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; We want to go beyond one and a half
[1:13:48] hours.
[1:13:50] Amen. Amen.
[1:13:52] Uh today I want to talk about
[1:13:56] believe not every spirit.
[1:14:03] Believe not every spirit.
[1:14:07] The Bible here has said that
[1:14:10] beloved
[1:14:12] that is this is the John
[1:14:15] uh it says beloved
[1:14:18] he's talking to believers
[1:14:20] he says believe not every spirit
[1:14:25] don't just believe every spirit
[1:14:28] but try the spirit
[1:14:33] whether they are of God
[1:14:36] because
[1:14:38] many false prophets
[1:14:40] are born out into the world.
[1:14:43] It says in other words each is each
[1:14:47] false prophet
[1:14:50] or each prophet
[1:14:52] carries a certain spirit.
[1:14:55] So he says there are too many
[1:14:59] and they are false
[1:15:01] going out into the world.
[1:15:04] He says don't just believe.
[1:15:07] But try the spirit
[1:15:09] whether they are of God and don't just
[1:15:13] judge
[1:15:15] before you try the spirit.
[1:15:18] Don't just condemn.
[1:15:21] He says but try the spirit
[1:15:24] whether they are of God.
[1:15:27] Hereby know you the spirit of God.
[1:15:30] Every spirit that confesses that Jesus
[1:15:34] Christ
[1:15:36] as is come in the flesh
[1:15:38] that is of God.
[1:15:42] The simplicity which is in Christ,
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; the word of God is not a complex
[1:15:50] and the spirit of God is not
[1:15:52] complicated.
[1:15:56] It is the people
[1:15:58] that build up a complex
[1:16:02] and get complex.
[1:16:07] and and and and and
[1:16:09] get into and get complicated.
[1:16:16] It says every spirit
[1:16:20] that confesses not
[1:16:23] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[1:16:27] is not of God.
[1:16:29] And this is that spirit
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:33] of antichrist
[1:16:35] wherever you have heard
[1:16:38] that it should come.
[1:16:41] And even now
[1:16:44] already
[1:16:46] it is in the world.
[1:16:50] Ye are of God,
[1:16:53] little children,
[1:16:55] and have overcome them
[1:16:57] [Applause]
[1:16:59] because
[1:17:00] greater is he
[1:17:02] that is in you
[1:17:04] than he that is in the world.
[1:17:08] In other words, he says, "Many have gone
[1:17:10] out in the world,
[1:17:13] but you have someone greater
[1:17:18] that's in you
[1:17:21] that is greater than them that is gone
[1:17:23] out."
[1:17:25] He says, "These false prophets,
[1:17:29] they are of the world.
[1:17:32] Therefore, they speak of the world.
[1:17:36] Even their speech
[1:17:38] is limited
[1:17:41] unto the things of the world
[1:17:44] and the world
[1:17:46] hears them. It's not a surprise.
[1:17:50] It's not a surprise
[1:17:53] that they have a lot of following.
[1:17:57] It says because they are of the world,
[1:18:00] they speak of the world. Therefore, the
[1:18:03] world has got to hear them.
[1:18:08] We are of God
[1:18:10] can hear us.
[1:18:12] He that knows God
[1:18:16] hears us.
[1:18:19] He that is not of God,
[1:18:22] hears not us.
[1:18:25] Hereby know with the spirit of truth
[1:18:28] and the spirit of error.
[1:18:32] As simple as that.
[1:18:34] Amen. It says that's how we know the
[1:18:36] spirit of God.
[1:18:41] Yes. The other is a spirit of error
[1:18:45] brother and sisters.
[1:18:48] We know
[1:18:50] or we must know
[1:18:52] or let us know
[1:18:55] that whatsoever words
[1:18:59] that man speaks
[1:19:02] and whatsoever deeds
[1:19:05] that a man does.
[1:19:08] They are influenced
[1:19:11] and inspired
[1:19:13] and moved
[1:19:16] by a certain spirit.
[1:19:20] It's a matter of spirit.
[1:19:26] [Applause]
[1:19:30] There is a spirit
[1:19:33] behind every deed.
[1:19:37] There is a spirit
[1:19:39] behind every word
[1:19:44] and that spirit
[1:19:47] is the one that we must try.
[1:19:54] Now listen,
[1:19:56] before you can speak anything,
[1:20:00] it comes from a certain spirit.
[1:20:03] [Applause]
[1:20:07] Whatever you speak,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; whatever you hear,
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; whatever you speak,
[1:20:15] whatever you hear,
[1:20:17] it is from a certain spirit
[1:20:24] and your speaking
[1:20:27] and your doing
[1:20:30] is a clear sign
[1:20:33] that you believed
[1:20:36] a certain spirit.
[1:20:39] Paul said,
[1:20:41] "Even so we have believed
[1:20:46] therefore we speak.
[1:20:49] Therefore, whatever you speak,
[1:20:52] whatever you hear,
[1:20:54] whatever you do,
[1:20:57] it's under a spirit."
[1:21:01] But God
[1:21:03] says,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; "Be careful, brother. Be careful,
[1:21:07] sister.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Don't just believe everything."
[1:21:12] [Applause]
[1:21:15] Amen.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; It's a matter of spirits
[1:21:20] because it's a spiritual warfare.
[1:21:24] We do not fight flesh and blood,
[1:21:28] but we are fighting powers of darkness,
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:32] rulers of high places
[1:21:35] and prosperities,
[1:21:36] [Applause]
[1:21:38] demons,
[1:21:40] a bunch of them
[1:21:43] that's been released out.
[1:21:46] We have come to the climax
[1:21:49] of the ages.
[1:21:52] It's a climax
[1:21:54] of all demons.
[1:21:57] Coming to a shutdown,
[1:22:01] coming to a showdown.
[1:22:03] The devil releasing out
[1:22:08] all hell
[1:22:10] upon the peoples of the world.
[1:22:12] So it is a climax
[1:22:15] of the edge.
[1:22:17] protects all the devils
[1:22:21] spirit
[1:22:22] that spirit through all the seven
[1:22:24] chapters.
[1:22:27] It's a climax
[1:22:29] that he pours out.
[1:22:32] All of the spirits
[1:22:34] that's in the seals,
[1:22:37] all the spirits that is in the seals,
[1:22:41] it's been all poured out.
[1:22:44] So we must encounter
[1:22:47] all these devils
[1:22:49] with discernment.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Listen brother,
[1:22:56] ask yourself
[1:22:57] what you have spoken,
[1:23:00] what you have done, whatever I speak,
[1:23:03] whatever I do,
[1:23:05] sit back,
[1:23:07] ask yourself,
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; what spirit led me?
[1:23:15] It says led of the spirit.
[1:23:20] So it is a spirit.
[1:23:22] It is every man
[1:23:26] has got to be led by a spirit.
[1:23:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; The God of this evil age,
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; he says,
[1:23:42] "Has God lost control?"
[1:23:48] Has God lost control?
[1:23:52] It's a question. Do you think that God
[1:23:55] has lost control?
[1:24:01] Uh, paragraph 55.
[1:24:11] Just stay with me
[1:24:14] just a short while.
[1:24:21] He says,
[1:24:23] "Has God lost control?"
[1:24:28] Or is is he just permitting another
[1:24:31] agent to control?
[1:24:40] I wonder
[1:24:46] God is no longer having control
[1:24:53] or has allowed another power to rule. I
[1:24:56] wonder the true answer to this question
[1:24:59] is
[1:25:02] to my opinion
[1:25:05] there is two opposing spirits
[1:25:10] in the world today.
[1:25:13] You know the contest between God and
[1:25:15] Satan
[1:25:18] says there's two opposing spirits
[1:25:21] in the world today.
[1:25:24] And if this spirits are contending,
[1:25:29] you have to be contending for something.
[1:25:34] They are contending for your soul.
[1:25:37] And they in the world today
[1:25:41] and they are at work.
[1:25:43] There can't be no more than two.
[1:25:47] There can't be no more than two heads.
[1:25:50] [Applause]
[1:25:55] All right. And one of them is the Holy
[1:25:57] Spirit
[1:25:59] who is at work. The other one is a
[1:26:02] spirit of the devil.
[1:26:04] And in this last days,
[1:26:07] in deception,
[1:26:09] he says, "In the last days, the spirit
[1:26:13] of the devil is working in deception.
[1:26:18] I am going to bless my thoughts right on
[1:26:20] there
[1:26:22] for the rest of the text.
[1:26:25] The two spirits,
[1:26:28] one of them, God is Holy Spirit.
[1:26:32] The other one, the devil's spirit
[1:26:36] walking in deception.
[1:26:38] The people of the earth
[1:26:41] are now making their choice.
[1:26:46] Brother,
[1:26:48] this spirit say you make a choice.
[1:26:52] You allow
[1:26:54] the spirit to control you.
[1:26:58] The Holy Spirit is here
[1:27:00] calling out the bride
[1:27:03] for Christ. He is doing it by
[1:27:07] vindicating his word
[1:27:10] of the promise to her.
[1:27:13] This is the edge
[1:27:15] showing that it is a Christ.
[1:27:18] If the finger is supposed to move in
[1:27:20] this age, if the finger
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:27:26] the finger will move.
[1:27:28] If the foot is supposed to move,
[1:27:32] the foot will move. If the eye is to see
[1:27:37] in this age, the eye will see.
[1:27:41] The spirit of God
[1:27:44] as it is grow out into the full stage of
[1:27:46] God
[1:27:51] is the age that now we are living in.
[1:27:56] Amen. Amen. My has gone off.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:09] It says
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; uh the devil's unholy spirit. The devil,
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; the devil's unholy spirit
[1:28:24] is here calling his church by the error
[1:28:29] as usual by perversion of the word of
[1:28:32] God
[1:28:36] like he did at the beginning.
[1:28:40] See it coming right back to that seed
[1:28:44] time again.
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:49] So he's talking about the two spirits,
[1:28:52] [Applause]
[1:28:53] the two powers
[1:28:55] that is in the world today
[1:28:58] trying to control the world.
[1:29:01] And he says one is of the Holy Spirit,
[1:29:05] another one is the unholy spirit.
[1:29:10] Then he says
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:29:18] in the church ages.
[1:29:25] Now remember this.
[1:29:29] Christ in the true church
[1:29:34] is the continuation of the book of Acts.
[1:29:50] Just stay with me.
[1:29:59] Christ in the true church
[1:30:02] is the continuation of the book of acts.
[1:30:06] But the book of revelation
[1:30:09] shows how that the antichrist
[1:30:14] would come into the church.
[1:30:18] Now I'm not talking about the church as
[1:30:21] DVF as as a church.
[1:30:24] days of the I'm not talking about the
[1:30:26] entire bride of Christ.
[1:30:30] I'm talking about you
[1:30:32] as an individual.
[1:30:35] It shows that the antichrist spirit
[1:30:39] would come into the church
[1:30:41] and defile it
[1:30:45] making you
[1:30:47] lukewarm
[1:30:49] for.
[1:30:53] It exposes Satan
[1:30:57] revealing his works
[1:31:00] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:31:05] and discrediting of God's word
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:11] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:31:13] the lake of fire.
[1:31:17] He fights that.
[1:31:20] He fights that.
[1:31:22] He cannot stand it.
[1:31:25] He knows that
[1:31:27] if the people get the true revelation,
[1:31:32] you you you yourself.
[1:31:35] If you get the true revelation
[1:31:38] of who you are,
[1:31:41] it says of the true church
[1:31:44] and what she is
[1:31:46] and what you are
[1:31:50] she stands for
[1:31:54] and what you can do.
[1:31:58] No matter works,
[1:32:00] you will be
[1:32:03] an invisible army.
[1:32:07] If you if you get the true refresh
[1:32:12] of the two spirits
[1:32:15] within the framework of the Christian
[1:32:20] and by God's spirit,
[1:32:23] the son
[1:32:25] will stand.
[1:32:28] the antichrist spirit.
[1:32:32] Satan will be blessed
[1:32:35] before you.
[1:32:37] He will be as definitely thwarted
[1:32:42] as when Christ withtood his every
[1:32:50] brother.
[1:32:52] If you
[1:32:55] by God is spirit
[1:33:02] and with stand
[1:33:06] the antichrist spirit,
[1:33:09] Satan will be powerless before you.
[1:33:13] While the devil has a power before you,
[1:33:16] you have no discernment of spirits. You
[1:33:19] have no discernment of spirits.
[1:33:25] Why often times we regret,
[1:33:28] oh, I wish how did I do that? How did I
[1:33:32] do that?
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; You did discern the spirits.
[1:33:37] Oh, I wish I didn't say that.
[1:33:40] It's about discernment, brother.
[1:33:46] Listen, brother, sister, we are not
[1:33:48] going to jump around today.
[1:33:51] We want you to be sober.
[1:33:53] We want you to be vigilant.
[1:33:56] That's when we shall see works of God.
[1:34:00] You will always conceive.
[1:34:04] You will always conceive what you
[1:34:05] believe.
[1:34:08] The results will come because of what
[1:34:10] you believe.
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:14] Because of what you receive,
[1:34:17] because of what you accept.
[1:34:20] That's what will bring forth results.
[1:34:23] So we want you to stay still.
[1:34:26] We want you to wait a little
[1:34:29] until you are certain
[1:34:32] that this is God.
[1:34:35] Listen brother
[1:34:37] before he can say
[1:34:40] that we are trying the spirit.
[1:34:43] First we must be certain
[1:34:47] by what spirit
[1:34:49] are we trying the other spirit by
[1:34:54] I'm discerning the spirit I'm trying I'm
[1:34:57] trying the spirit
[1:34:59] by what spirit
[1:35:02] are you using to try the other spirit
[1:35:06] because listen
[1:35:08] first John 4:4 says
[1:35:11] we have got little children
[1:35:14] and have overcome them
[1:35:17] because greater is he that is in you
[1:35:20] than he that is in the world.
[1:35:23] And the prophet says by God is the
[1:35:26] spirit discern the spirit of antichrist.
[1:35:31] So by what spirit?
[1:35:34] By what spirit
[1:35:36] are you using to discern or to try?
[1:35:40] Yes. For because
[1:35:43] if we put the spirit of God
[1:35:47] to a test
[1:35:49] by the word
[1:35:51] and we ourselves
[1:35:54] have not the spirit of God,
[1:35:57] we are going to condemn the truth.
[1:36:01] Listen brother, I'm saying if you have a
[1:36:05] wrong spirit
[1:36:07] and you take the word to try to try
[1:36:11] another spirit,
[1:36:13] trust me, you are going to condemn the
[1:36:16] spirit of God.
[1:36:18] Listen brother, Jesus Christ said the
[1:36:22] Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:36:25] are the official interpreters
[1:36:30] of the law of Moses.
[1:36:33] Therefore, whatever they beat you to do,
[1:36:38] do it because they they are the official
[1:36:42] interpreters.
[1:36:46] They have got to do that job.
[1:36:49] They take the scripture
[1:36:51] that Jesus Christ said,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; but them themselves
[1:36:56] they are of the devil.
[1:36:59] When the word was put before them
[1:37:03] to try Jesus
[1:37:05] and Jesus was put into a trial,
[1:37:09] they got the scripture.
[1:37:12] The Pharisees
[1:37:14] and they tried to the word.
[1:37:17] They took the scripture to try the
[1:37:19] spirit
[1:37:21] which was working in Jesus
[1:37:24] because they had the wrong spirit
[1:37:28] but the right scripture.
[1:37:30] They condemned the Lord of glory
[1:37:36] because they used the wrong spirit
[1:37:40] to try the spirit of God.
[1:37:43] Listen brother,
[1:37:45] I'm saying
[1:37:47] if we put the spirit of God
[1:37:50] to a test
[1:37:52] by the word
[1:37:54] and we ourselves
[1:37:57] have not the spirit of God.
[1:38:01] We are going to condemn the truth
[1:38:05] and say
[1:38:07] and say
[1:38:09] and we shall say
[1:38:11] it ought to be this way or that way.
[1:38:16] Listen,
[1:38:17] if we are to try the spirits,
[1:38:21] I want you to listen carefully.
[1:38:24] If we are to try their spirits,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; we must
[1:38:30] we must to
[1:38:33] I want you to keep this in your heart,
[1:38:37] in your inner man.
[1:38:40] If we are to try the spirits,
[1:38:44] we must start with the one in us.
[1:38:49] Start with the spirit in you.
[1:38:52] that one first.
[1:38:55] If you have a wrong spirit,
[1:38:58] it is impossible
[1:39:00] for you to judge the spirit of God
[1:39:05] and say it is true.
[1:39:09] Amen. You can't.
[1:39:14] If we have the spirit of God,
[1:39:18] if you have the spirit of God,
[1:39:21] then you will judge well
[1:39:24] and testify
[1:39:26] that the testimony is true
[1:39:30] and you will judge the spirit of Satan
[1:39:32] that it is wrong.
[1:39:35] Amen. I give you a clear example.
[1:39:39] If a minister stands here
[1:39:43] or you somewhere you are listening
[1:39:46] and is ministering the word
[1:39:49] or if a sister stands before you
[1:39:53] brother
[1:39:55] and you want to try you say you're
[1:39:56] trying the spirit
[1:40:01] and now
[1:40:04] you you you you want to try the spirit.
[1:40:08] He said it's brother Martin brother
[1:40:10] Julius I have to try this spirit
[1:40:15] first ask yourself
[1:40:17] now he it stands with a testimony
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; that I have the Holy Spirit
[1:40:23] listen brother sister no matter the
[1:40:26] confession of anyone
[1:40:28] you have a right
[1:40:31] a god-given right
[1:40:34] not to believe their confession
[1:40:38] their testimony
[1:40:40] until you have tried it.
[1:40:43] You have that right
[1:40:47] and the conclusion you make after that
[1:40:54] will determine of what spirit you are
[1:40:55] also.
[1:40:59] So you start with yourself
[1:41:01] [Applause]
[1:41:02] try first the spirit
[1:41:05] and you find out
[1:41:08] Because the spirit the things of God
[1:41:12] no man knows.
[1:41:14] First Corinthians 2:9 to 16.
[1:41:19] They are known of God.
[1:41:22] They are searched by the spirit of God
[1:41:26] and the spirit of God himself.
[1:41:30] Know the deep things of God.
[1:41:33] And who has known the mind of God.
[1:41:37] that he should guide the Lord,
[1:41:41] that he should cancel him.
[1:41:44] So a natural man
[1:41:46] knows not the things of God,
[1:41:49] but the things of God cannot be
[1:41:53] discerned.
[1:41:59] My brother,
[1:42:01] I come to realize
[1:42:04] that the problems we are having today
[1:42:08] in our families,
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; in our churches,
[1:42:12] wherever we go, it's because
[1:42:16] we are trying to judge the spirits
[1:42:22] without using the spirit of God.
[1:42:26] We are trying to judge the spirits
[1:42:29] when we ourselves
[1:42:32] are minded.
[1:42:36] Amen.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; And the cause of this
[1:42:40] the result of this
[1:42:42] it brings shame,
[1:42:45] blasphemy
[1:42:47] and people acting out of place
[1:42:52] and get to think
[1:42:55] they are right when yet they are wrong.
[1:42:59] and built a complex
[1:43:02] around themselves
[1:43:05] thinking that they desend well.
[1:43:10] But yet the problem is
[1:43:13] they are inspired by wrong spirit
[1:43:17] leading them into a complex.
[1:43:21] Listen brother,
[1:43:24] the things of God are not discerned.
[1:43:29] The natural man doesn't know the things
[1:43:31] of God.
[1:43:34] Amen.
[1:43:37] He cannot brother.
[1:43:43] It says
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; uh paragraph 16.
[1:43:55] Just stay with me. Just stay with me.
[1:44:04] All right.
[1:44:08] And I thought comparing the deer with a
[1:44:10] man that'sing thirsting for God. Before
[1:44:22] the enemy gets there,
[1:44:27] about a child of God, there is something
[1:44:30] about the child of God
[1:44:34] that when you once are born into the
[1:44:37] spirit of God,
[1:44:40] when you are once
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; when When you once are born into the
[1:44:43] spirit of God
[1:44:49] and receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:51] Spirit,
[1:44:53] there is something about the person
[1:44:58] that can sense the enemy.
[1:45:03] You can take a man
[1:45:06] when he's taking the scripture
[1:45:09] and reading the scripture.
[1:45:12] and he try to inject something to that
[1:45:14] scripture
[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:20] and injecting something contrary to the
[1:45:22] scripture.
[1:45:25] A man that's filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:29] can sense that right now.
[1:45:32] He's talking about a spiritual man,
[1:45:36] one that's born of God.
[1:45:39] He says they have a spiritual sense.
[1:45:44] They can sense the enemy right now.
[1:45:47] There is they can sense right quick
[1:45:51] that there is something out of the way
[1:45:56] when he gets into a place
[1:45:59] and that little certain sense in there
[1:46:06] that is done to protect your life.
[1:46:11] the sense in the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:15] It is only the Holy Spirit
[1:46:18] that can catch
[1:46:22] that has that sense
[1:46:25] which catches the lies of the enemy.
[1:46:31] Amen.
[1:46:33] It's not in the natural man.
[1:46:38] It's it's it's the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:43] Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; You know
[1:46:47] the brother said,
[1:46:51] "Brother,
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; my wife has a wrong spirit.
[1:46:58] I've tried to cast it out,
[1:47:01] but it's still there."
[1:47:05] He told him
[1:47:07] go buy the chocolate
[1:47:10] take it to your wife. In other words,
[1:47:13] you're doing it in a wrong way.
[1:47:16] His thinking is right with the word
[1:47:18] cast.
[1:47:21] But doesn't work that way.
[1:47:25] He said you are doing it wrong.
[1:47:29] He didn't have enough discernment.
[1:47:34] There was something just a little
[1:47:36] chocolate could take.
[1:47:39] It was not the chocolate. It was not the
[1:47:41] chocolate but an expression of love.
[1:47:49] Just go and express love.
[1:47:54] Now listen brother,
[1:47:56] what am I trying to mean? What I'm
[1:47:59] trying to show you is often times you
[1:48:02] fail to get results.
[1:48:05] and what you are trying to overcome
[1:48:07] or what you think you should overcome
[1:48:10] or whom you think you should help
[1:48:14] because to begin with you are doing it
[1:48:17] in a wrong way is influenced by a wrong
[1:48:20] spirit.
[1:48:26] The devil can play both of you
[1:48:32] in your spirituality.
[1:48:35] He can make you to get uh to to to you
[1:48:38] know says
[1:48:41] if the devil cannot take you out from
[1:48:43] it.
[1:48:45] He will make you go overboard.
[1:48:49] So the devil will make you go overboard
[1:48:53] and he'll get both of you defeated.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Then
[1:48:58] so he says
[1:49:01] enticing spirits
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; I just have a lot of quotes here
[1:49:08] not too much jumping around and things
[1:49:13] we just want to learn.
[1:49:19] It says
[1:49:23] power.
[1:49:33] So the the Bible has told us
[1:49:36] that we must try the spirits
[1:49:40] before we can judge them
[1:49:43] whether these spirits are of God.
[1:49:47] So he says now today
[1:49:51] so many people
[1:49:53] are listening.
[1:49:56] Look
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; so many people are listening to enticing
[1:50:00] spirits.
[1:50:02] [Applause]
[1:50:05] Instead of taking the word of God,
[1:50:09] it says spirits
[1:50:11] they are in the world they are demons.
[1:50:16] and they go out
[1:50:18] into places and get amongst men.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:50:26] ministers,
[1:50:28] they get amongst church members.
[1:50:33] They get amongst good people
[1:50:36] and they cause them to come into
[1:50:40] a illusion.
[1:50:42] And they say things
[1:50:45] and you do things and you touch things
[1:50:48] and practice things and practice things
[1:50:53] as contract
[1:51:10] things
[1:51:11] contrary to the
[1:51:14] Spirits in the world
[1:51:18] believe not every spirit.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:51:27] it says they are there in the world.
[1:51:30] And in Matthew 24, he says
[1:51:33] verse four,
[1:51:36] and Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:51:39] we just we just go here. Take heed that
[1:51:42] no man deceive you.
[1:51:47] Don't just believe.
[1:51:50] Every minister,
[1:51:52] don't just believe. Every brother, every
[1:51:55] sister,
[1:51:56] I had a dream.
[1:51:59] I say vision
[1:52:01] and daughter
[1:52:03] try the spirit
[1:52:05] of God.
[1:52:07] Everybody says,
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; "I'm tired of these prophets that say, I
[1:52:12] had a dream. I had a dream.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of the prophets.
[1:52:19] I had a dream."
[1:52:22] Brother, it has got to be first tried.
[1:52:26] If it is not matching with the script,
[1:52:29] no matter how good your dream is,
[1:52:33] it's wrong.
[1:52:35] Amen.
[1:52:37] The brother come to brother.
[1:52:39] The dream looked nice.
[1:52:42] The wife went into adultery
[1:52:45] and another man and another man and
[1:52:49] another man. Then she came back to him
[1:52:52] and he took her in and he was a minister
[1:52:56] and he said I had a dream and this a
[1:52:59] dream. She came to me and this and that.
[1:53:03] He said, "Brother, you are sincere.
[1:53:06] Your dream is of the devil,
[1:53:11] but it looked nice."
[1:53:14] It looked like it is it is preaching
[1:53:16] forgiveness,
[1:53:19] but it was to the scripture,
[1:53:23] no matter how tender you come,
[1:53:26] how lovely you come,
[1:53:30] you may be a sheep in
[1:53:35] You know brother, it's not about the
[1:53:38] tenderness,
[1:53:40] not about the loveliness,
[1:53:43] how friendly you come,
[1:53:46] how good you are.
[1:53:48] spirits get among a good people.
[1:53:53] We have got to put you to a test.
[1:53:56] We are going to try you by the word
[1:53:59] and by the spirit of God.
[1:54:02] It says many shall come in my name
[1:54:07] Christ. I'm anointed.
[1:54:09] I'm anointed
[1:54:11] and shall deceive many.
[1:54:14] the spirit of the devil
[1:54:17] working in deception.
[1:54:19] And he says, "And many false prophets
[1:54:24] shall rise and deceive many."
[1:54:27] And he says, "For this shall arise false
[1:54:29] Christ
[1:54:32] anointed,
[1:54:34] anointed by the Holy Spirit,
[1:54:38] but upon their spirit
[1:54:40] in their soul. They have the wrong
[1:54:42] spirit. Remember brother sister the
[1:54:46] scripture says
[1:54:48] or the prophet preached
[1:54:50] anointed ones at any time
[1:54:53] why are people anointed
[1:54:56] and not born again because the scripture
[1:54:59] says in the last days
[1:55:02] from the book of acts
[1:55:05] pour out my spirit
[1:55:07] upon all flesh
[1:55:10] upon all flesh
[1:55:13] They can prophesy
[1:55:16] and see visions and dreams.
[1:55:20] But
[1:55:22] false anointed
[1:55:25] and false prophets
[1:55:28] and shall show great signs
[1:55:31] and wonders
[1:55:33] so much that if it were possible,
[1:55:38] they shall receive the very elect.
[1:55:42] Behold, I have told you before.
[1:55:46] Look, brother
[1:55:48] in Revelations 13,
[1:55:51] the scripture says
[1:55:53] that the devil,
[1:55:55] the beast,
[1:55:57] he signs wonders,
[1:56:00] receive them
[1:56:03] to upon the earth,
[1:56:05] that they might receive a mark.
[1:56:08] And when they received that mark,
[1:56:11] it's the mark of condemnation.
[1:56:14] It's because
[1:56:16] the people can hear the voice.
[1:56:20] They see the sign
[1:56:22] and are deceived by the sign.
[1:56:25] Not discerning the voice.
[1:56:29] But the scripture says, "There is a
[1:56:31] voice of the sign.
[1:56:34] And to every sign
[1:56:37] there is a voice
[1:56:39] which comes with a sign.
[1:56:41] In other words, listen brother, every
[1:56:44] miracle,
[1:56:46] every sign, every wonder
[1:56:48] is determined to bring repentance.
[1:56:52] [Applause]
[1:56:54] That is the scripture. The scripture
[1:56:56] says
[1:56:58] unto you,
[1:57:00] [Applause]
[1:57:07] if the works that were done in you,
[1:57:10] if the works,
[1:57:13] if the miracles,
[1:57:15] if the works,
[1:57:18] if the wonders,
[1:57:20] if the signs
[1:57:22] that were done in you
[1:57:25] were done In Sodom,
[1:57:27] he might have revenanted
[1:57:31] his chosen, every sign, every wonder.
[1:57:35] miracle
[1:57:37] is determined
[1:57:39] to bring repentance
[1:57:42] and to the peoples of the world
[1:57:45] not to just draw attention
[1:57:49] or to get money glory
[1:57:52] because God does not share his glory
[1:57:56] but he wants the people to repent
[1:57:59] that's why he does the works
[1:58:01] because if you don't believe the works
[1:58:04] he says believed a sign and he
[1:58:10] the son of Abraham
[1:58:13] the time came
[1:58:15] he wanted to bless his son
[1:58:19] and according to him
[1:58:22] he wanted to bless Esau
[1:58:25] but
[1:58:29] Jacob disguised himself
[1:58:33] [Applause]
[1:58:34] and to be like Esau.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; And when the prophet
[1:58:39] Isaac
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; touched the hands of Jacob,
[1:58:46] the sign
[1:58:48] that these are the hands of Esau
[1:58:52] and the voice
[1:58:54] of Jacob
[1:58:56] that the prophet blessed him anyhow.
[1:59:00] He went with a sign.
[1:59:03] I understand that it was of the Lord.
[1:59:07] But I want you to understand
[1:59:10] in the message a time of decision
[1:59:14] says that God is a prophet.
[1:59:17] Sometimes make a wrong decision
[1:59:22] and he was talking about Isaac.
[1:59:26] How we follow the signless
[1:59:31] yet the voice was contrary to the sign.
[1:59:37] Sure.
[1:59:39] The voice
[1:59:41] is not the scripture
[1:59:44] but in a sign
[1:59:46] is scripture.
[1:59:51] Amen. Take the voice,
[1:59:55] leave the
[1:59:58] here it is, brother.
[2:00:01] He says
[2:00:04] in Matthew 7,
[2:00:07] let me read it there.
[2:00:09] Verse 15.
[2:00:13] Beware of false prophets.
[2:00:16] Which come to you
[2:00:18] in a ship is clothing.
[2:00:22] But any
[2:00:24] ravening wallpap
[2:00:31] can be so tender soft.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; She might be so soft.
[2:00:36] [Applause]
[2:00:37] But if she's a cont
[2:00:59] to defile you,
[2:01:02] that preacher over there
[2:01:05] come to you tender.
[2:01:08] But if it's conting
[2:01:18] to you
[2:01:19] just right now, I don't know.
[2:01:22] Try it by the scripture.
[2:01:25] I don't know what you're thinking about.
[2:01:28] I don't know what you did. What you
[2:01:29] think about
[2:01:31] wondering was that the Lord
[2:01:35] the time of decision
[2:01:37] You can choose right now.
[2:01:40] You can decide right now. You can start
[2:01:43] with your soul
[2:01:46] says you shall know them by their
[2:01:50] the true spirit of God.
[2:01:53] It must
[2:01:55] it must cast out devils.
[2:01:59] It must heal the sick.
[2:02:01] It must raise the dead.
[2:02:04] It must take up sance.
[2:02:07] It must do great signs.
[2:02:10] It must do wonders.
[2:02:13] It must do miracles.
[2:02:16] And it must bring forth
[2:02:20] the life of Christ.
[2:02:24] Amen.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; None of this should miss out.
[2:02:30] [Applause]
[2:02:31] The fruits which is love.
[2:02:35] peace and patience,
[2:02:38] long suffering and meekness,
[2:02:41] faith and temperance and gentleness.
[2:02:45] It's has got to come forth out of that
[2:02:48] spirit
[2:02:51] brother and the spirit of God
[2:02:55] which is the true spirit
[2:02:58] must stay
[2:03:01] with every word.
[2:03:05] So if they are signs,
[2:03:08] they are wonders, they are miracles,
[2:03:11] you are seeing a little bit of fruits,
[2:03:15] but they are not staying with the what
[2:03:19] the fruits you are seeing
[2:03:22] are just for a time.
[2:03:24] Nature given virtues.
[2:03:32] There are people created naturally. They
[2:03:34] are kind, naturally joyful.
[2:03:41] If they don't start with the word,
[2:03:45] don't rush.
[2:03:47] Don't rush. Don't rush.
[2:03:50] Don't rush to conclude.
[2:03:53] Don't rush to conclude.
[2:03:56] That this is the spirit of God.
[2:03:59] You might disagree and shout
[2:04:03] as shouting can be
[2:04:06] expressing joy
[2:04:10] but let the word come.
[2:04:12] What's your attitude towards that word?
[2:04:17] What's your attitude towards that word?
[2:04:21] The people run to and from
[2:04:24] seeking the signs, wonders and
[2:04:27] I want to have a mighty man of God.
[2:04:31] They continue wondering to and fro
[2:04:34] till the prophet says why are people to
[2:04:41] brother sister.
[2:04:43] The spirit of God stands with every word
[2:04:48] and it believes and lives by every word,
[2:04:52] every word of the Bible.
[2:04:55] But on the other side, the antichrist
[2:04:58] spirit.
[2:04:59] It can be in a man
[2:05:02] and he can do wonders and miracles,
[2:05:06] but he can't produce the fruits
[2:05:10] and he cannot believe the entire Bible.
[2:05:13] Because the antichrist spirit
[2:05:16] is a party gospel preacher
[2:05:20] is a party gospel preacher.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; I'm missing that word.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; The antichrist spirit
[2:05:26] is a party gospel preacher.
[2:05:35] Thank you.
[2:05:39] Amen.
[2:05:45] I believe this, I don't believe the
[2:05:46] other. Amen.
[2:05:51] Is a party gospel preacher.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; I will preach that but that I don't
[2:05:57] want.
[2:06:00] We often times
[2:06:02] approach the word
[2:06:05] and pick out
[2:06:07] what we want.
[2:06:10] Moreover, friends,
[2:06:13] even the friends we pick,
[2:06:16] we pick such friends
[2:06:19] that will take sides with us
[2:06:24] even in our foolishness.
[2:06:32] We want friends
[2:06:35] who will lean on, who will stand with
[2:06:37] us, who will come on our side
[2:06:40] in our foolishness
[2:06:43] when he lasted after his sister.
[2:06:48] He had a friend
[2:06:51] and the friend said, "What's the
[2:06:52] matter?"
[2:06:55] He said, "I love
[2:06:58] my sister."
[2:07:00] And the friend said,
[2:07:02] "I've got a big thing to worry about.
[2:07:06] Let's lay down and do such and such."
[2:07:10] And he he helped him in his own sin.
[2:07:15] That's the kind of people we choose.
[2:07:19] Listen, brother, we are not here. We are
[2:07:23] not here to be cheerleaders.
[2:07:28] I'm not a cheerleader.
[2:07:30] Pastor is not a cheerleader.
[2:07:34] Not a cheerleader.
[2:07:37] He is a mentor.
[2:07:40] He is a mentor.
[2:07:42] He's not here to cheerlead you.
[2:07:47] Oh, this and that. Brother, you are
[2:07:49] right. We are not here to b your back.
[2:07:54] We are here to see your back.
[2:07:57] We are not here to just pat you on the
[2:07:59] back. We are here to see scratch your
[2:08:01] back
[2:08:03] to make sure that you stay in line
[2:08:06] because the prophet said and I saw this
[2:08:10] bright
[2:08:12] getting out of the line and I stay in
[2:08:16] line.
[2:08:18] That's why you bring the word
[2:08:21] and we are full gospel preachers
[2:08:25] because we know
[2:08:27] the word of God is the son of the
[2:08:30] thoughts and even
[2:08:33] we know
[2:08:35] that it's only the word
[2:08:37] that can keep the seed.
[2:08:40] The word is the rain.
[2:08:43] The word is the seed.
[2:08:46] The word is the ground
[2:08:48] because the child of God is the word.
[2:08:55] The word receives the word
[2:08:58] and when the word meets the word
[2:09:01] then something has got to happen.
[2:09:04] Remember the antichrist spirit
[2:09:07] is a part gospel preacher.
[2:09:10] And when he went to Eve
[2:09:13] in the garden of Ethan, he preached that
[2:09:16] to her a party gospel.
[2:09:19] I want to believe. I want to believe
[2:09:23] that if and the serpent
[2:09:26] that if and the serpent
[2:09:28] were good friends because the Bible says
[2:09:32] the serpent was more subp
[2:09:37] than all the beast
[2:09:40] that God had created
[2:09:42] and when he came to Eve the Bible starts
[2:09:45] and says the devil say oh yeah
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; I maybe was responding
[2:09:51] [Applause]
[2:09:53] as evil preached to him. You know, God
[2:09:56] created trees in
[2:09:59] the trees here. I see.
[2:10:01] And they will say, "Oh yeah." Oh yes.
[2:10:04] Amen to that.
[2:10:06] God said,
[2:10:11] "You shall not eat of every tree of the
[2:10:13] garden."
[2:10:16] And he substituted the what?
[2:10:19] and she he preached unto her a part
[2:10:24] and she received it
[2:10:26] and she conceived.
[2:10:29] What she conceived was murder
[2:10:33] and murder comes from hatred.
[2:10:38] Any time you get a wrong spirit
[2:10:41] and believe a certain enticing spirit,
[2:10:45] you see it starts with hatred. Listen
[2:10:49] brother,
[2:10:51] Satan has ministers.
[2:10:53] Second Corinthians 11th
[2:10:57] and he says, "I'm afraid. I'm jealous of
[2:11:01] you
[2:11:03] jealousy."
[2:11:04] He says that the devil
[2:11:07] did be
[2:11:11] should be you also.
[2:11:14] And he said we are not uh
[2:11:18] it's not a surprise
[2:11:21] that the devilers
[2:11:23] of Satan
[2:11:25] [Applause]
[2:11:26] disguise themselves
[2:11:29] as messengers of light.
[2:11:31] The devil will come to you with a
[2:11:34] revelation. He will come to you with a
[2:11:38] dream. He will come to you with a
[2:11:41] vision. will come to you with an
[2:11:44] inspiration
[2:11:46] and you will think
[2:11:49] it is of the Lord.
[2:11:51] Watch my brothers
[2:11:53] what will come out of.
[2:11:57] Amen.
[2:12:00] anointed ones at any time.
[2:12:03] The devil came to Martin Luther
[2:12:06] with a crown on his head
[2:12:09] and his shoes on his feet.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, he came to my and he said, "Martin,
[2:12:16] worship me, Martin. I am Jesus.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Worship me, Martin. I am your Lord."
[2:12:23] And Martin watched
[2:12:26] the scripture
[2:12:28] running in his mind
[2:12:31] and the prophet said
[2:12:33] that is a Pentecostal bait.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; It is a snare to the Pentecostal church.
[2:12:42] They would believe it.
[2:12:44] our brothers and sister today
[2:12:47] who believed that the rapture was
[2:12:50] September 23rd
[2:12:52] you are still here.
[2:12:55] I said brother I told her brother I owe
[2:12:59] you a rep
[2:13:03] when comes
[2:13:06] I repentance
[2:13:09] in other words no you have to repent to
[2:13:10] me
[2:13:14] is this
[2:13:16] listen we are brothers and sisters
[2:13:20] anointed of the devil
[2:13:23] by the devil
[2:13:25] And I believe
[2:13:27] they anointed by the God by by God.
[2:13:32] They saw a vision of God.
[2:13:34] I saw Jesus. I saw Jesus.
[2:13:37] And I want to ask you,
[2:13:40] but man of Jesus. Did you see?
[2:13:44] I saw an anointed.
[2:13:46] At the man of an anointed, did you see?
[2:13:49] [Applause]
[2:13:51] Martin
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; when he looked at this Jesus
[2:13:56] and he said
[2:13:58] go away from me Satan
[2:14:03] you are the ground
[2:14:06] the scripture says
[2:14:08] the saints will crown him
[2:14:11] in the last days
[2:14:13] the saints will crown him.
[2:14:16] So where did you get that crowd?
[2:14:20] Look brother,
[2:14:22] you would come running
[2:14:26] maybe one of you
[2:14:29] or someone not here
[2:14:31] would come say I saw Jesus.
[2:14:34] Oh my my my my.
[2:14:39] I saw Jesus.
[2:14:41] He had a crown.
[2:14:43] He said, "Worship me."
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; I see visions.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; It's not a mighty thing.
[2:14:55] It's a single vision, brother.
[2:14:58] It's not a mighty thing
[2:15:01] to make someone mightier.
[2:15:04] It is to reveal God.
[2:15:08] It is to reveal God.
[2:15:11] So there many people today
[2:15:13] They run like that.
[2:15:16] You know, I looked at this fellow.
[2:15:20] I I started with a memon
[2:15:24] and he told me,
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; you know, Joseph Smith,
[2:15:29] he saw God the Father
[2:15:31] and God the Father,
[2:15:34] introduced him, God the Son, and I said,
[2:15:37] "Wait, wait. God the father was here
[2:15:41] and God the son was here. I said yes. I
[2:15:45] said a v that vision is false
[2:15:49] because one on the throne
[2:15:53] now
[2:15:57] that is false.
[2:16:00] God is one.
[2:16:02] Now look certainly
[2:16:04] transforms himself
[2:16:06] as a messenger of light
[2:16:09] and be the people.
[2:16:13] Amen. In Acts chapter 8
[2:16:17] verse 5, the Bible says,
[2:16:24] "Then Philip went down to the city of
[2:16:26] Samaria,
[2:16:29] and he preached Christ
[2:16:31] unto them,
[2:16:33] and the people with one accord
[2:16:38] gave heed
[2:16:40] unto those things
[2:16:43] which Philip spake,
[2:16:45] hearing
[2:16:47] and seeing
[2:16:49] the miracles which he did.
[2:16:52] For unclean spirits,
[2:16:55] crying with loud voice
[2:16:59] came out of many
[2:17:01] that were possessed with them.
[2:17:04] And many taken with pulses,
[2:17:08] and that were them were healed.
[2:17:12] And there was a great joy in that city.
[2:17:15] And there was a certain man
[2:17:19] called Simon
[2:17:22] which before time
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; before time in the same city
[2:17:29] the sorcery
[2:17:32] and bewitched the people.
[2:17:39] He used sorcery.
[2:17:42] and bewitched the people of Sam
[2:17:47] out that he himself was some great one
[2:17:52] to whom they all gave heed
[2:17:58] from the least to the greatest
[2:18:01] saying this man
[2:18:04] is the great power of God
[2:18:10] And to him they had regard
[2:18:16] because that of a long time
[2:18:20] he had bewitched them
[2:18:24] with sorceries
[2:18:29] and they believed
[2:18:33] that one
[2:18:35] that
[2:18:40] is in the church today. Listen,
[2:18:44] as Simon bewitched the people of Samaria
[2:18:51] in a message recognizing your day and
[2:18:54] its message,
[2:18:57] when God showed the prophet a vision of
[2:19:00] the bride
[2:19:04] and he saw that bride
[2:19:08] moving.
[2:19:09] Then he says, "Then I saw
[2:19:14] this modern church
[2:19:18] which is led by the witch."
[2:19:24] Brother, sister,
[2:19:26] that's paragraph 47.
[2:19:30] recognizing your day and its message.
[2:19:33] There are people today
[2:19:36] in the church
[2:19:38] that don't know
[2:19:41] they are bewitched
[2:19:44] by the spirit of Jezebel
[2:19:48] by enticing spirits.
[2:19:51] They do not know
[2:19:54] that they are as
[2:20:03] he bewitched them
[2:20:06] and they believed him
[2:20:09] a mighty man of God.
[2:20:13] But when Philip preached,
[2:20:16] they were delivered.
[2:20:18] So when the message was preached,
[2:20:21] There was a great deliverance
[2:20:25] even as Philip preached
[2:20:28] and the people were delivered.
[2:20:30] So this witch this witch
[2:20:34] today working in modern churches
[2:20:38] bewitching the people
[2:20:41] making them act the way they do.
[2:20:45] It's what God sent the message.
[2:20:51] to deliver the people out of
[2:20:55] and he said
[2:20:57] set these people free
[2:21:00] and he said gets of hell
[2:21:04] to the name of Jesus.
[2:21:06] It is a message of God's deliverance.
[2:21:12] It is a message that opens the eyes of
[2:21:15] the blind.
[2:21:17] It is a message that turns on the light.
[2:21:22] Listen brother, if it is contrary to the
[2:21:25] message,
[2:21:29] don't believe it. It's of the devil.
[2:21:34] Amen.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; The message
[2:21:38] is Christ.
[2:21:40] So
[2:21:42] what happened
[2:21:44] to the people of Samaria
[2:21:47] was because
[2:21:49] they didn't have the spirit of God.
[2:21:53] So they couldn't discern.
[2:21:56] They couldn't differentiate
[2:21:59] between the spirit.
[2:22:02] They couldn't not they could not uh
[2:22:06] they could not know
[2:22:10] what spirit was in Simon.
[2:22:14] But when the gospel is preached,
[2:22:17] I want you to hear my brothers. When the
[2:22:20] gospel is preached, it calls your
[2:22:23] attention.
[2:22:26] God calls your attention
[2:22:29] to a personal examination.
[2:22:32] [Applause]
[2:22:35] Not just excitement,
[2:22:38] not just a screaming,
[2:22:40] but a personal examination
[2:22:44] to examine yourself.
[2:22:48] Will you be in the faith?
[2:22:51] We are not here to entertain you.
[2:22:56] No. Heaven has no entertainers.
[2:23:00] Heaven has no comedians.
[2:23:04] Heaven has a sober men and women.
[2:23:10] Heaven has only praise
[2:23:14] and praise is not entertainment.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:25] Praise
[2:23:28] is not entertainment.
[2:23:32] It is praise.
[2:23:35] Entertainment is entertainment.
[2:23:38] The gospel is not a joke.
[2:23:41] The gospel is not a joke.
[2:23:45] It comes to discern you
[2:23:48] and to shake you, brother,
[2:23:51] and to get you in lying.
[2:23:54] The Bible says second Peter chapter 2,
[2:23:59] as there were false prophets and
[2:24:01] teachers among them,
[2:24:06] so there shall be there also among you
[2:24:11] and Jude wonders of the same.
[2:24:15] And Acts 20 also,
[2:24:19] it says, "Men shall arise,
[2:24:22] not from the outside
[2:24:25] among your own selves
[2:24:28] to draw disciples to themselves,
[2:24:32] enticed by spirits."
[2:24:35] He says, "As it was
[2:24:38] in the old days,
[2:24:40] so shall it be in the end times."
[2:24:44] Brother, sister, there was in the days
[2:24:48] of of of Elijah,
[2:24:51] in the days of Micaiah,
[2:24:54] that when God was determined,
[2:24:57] there was a wicked king
[2:24:59] that had gone astray
[2:25:02] off of the what?
[2:25:05] The king
[2:25:07] and God
[2:25:09] wanted to destroy that king.
[2:25:12] And God said,
[2:25:14] He called for a meeting
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; that he may fulfill
[2:25:20] the word of Elijah.
[2:25:23] And he said, "Who shall go
[2:25:27] and receive help
[2:25:29] that he may go into the battle
[2:25:32] to be destroyed?"
[2:25:34] Some of the deception
[2:25:37] is to your own destruction.
[2:25:42] Yes, sir. because of your stubborniness.
[2:25:49] If you get too stubborn,
[2:25:53] God will allow you
[2:25:58] to go into an illusion
[2:26:01] for your own destruction.
[2:26:04] Therefore, God says there came a lying
[2:26:07] spirit
[2:26:10] and he said, "I will go.
[2:26:13] and deceive him.
[2:26:16] How will you do it?
[2:26:18] I will go
[2:26:20] in the prophets.
[2:26:25] 400 of them
[2:26:28] gathered before the king
[2:26:31] and they were filled
[2:26:33] with a lying spirit.
[2:26:40] Yes sir. You will go to your fellows,
[2:26:44] your sisters, you grow with your size.
[2:26:49] We love to take advice
[2:26:52] from our agements.
[2:26:55] It's an error. Don't do that.
[2:26:58] He deceived one of the kings in the
[2:26:59] Bible.
[2:27:04] And he he forsook the c of the old men
[2:27:09] and he took the c of the young men that
[2:27:13] destroyed him.
[2:27:15] see such people and you say, "Oh
[2:27:18] brother, shall I do such and such a
[2:27:21] thing?"
[2:27:23] And these fellows you have grown up
[2:27:24] with,
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; they are babes in Christ,
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; just young like me,
[2:27:33] they will deceive you.
[2:27:36] Go the pastor.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; And say go to the pastor.
[2:27:45] enticing spirits.
[2:27:47] The lying spirit
[2:27:50] entered in this prophets
[2:27:52] and they all told him
[2:27:57] you will overtake it. You will win.
[2:28:00] You'll overcome
[2:28:02] you come out with victory
[2:28:04] and
[2:28:06] the horns.
[2:28:10] And he said by this
[2:28:14] you will drive them
[2:28:18] says the Lord.
[2:28:25] But
[2:28:26] because
[2:28:30] was so minded
[2:28:35] centered
[2:28:38] [Music]
[2:28:40] seeking
[2:28:44] he he he gathered these prophets
[2:28:49] very certain
[2:28:52] that they will validate desire
[2:29:07] and they said you go
[2:29:10] and you overtake it
[2:29:14] will tell you that
[2:29:16] you go
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; you you go
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; watch out brother Sister
[2:29:26] lying spirits
[2:29:31] yet
[2:29:32] the word of God had already declared
[2:29:36] against
[2:29:39] you can't bless what God has come
[2:29:45] and you compare that with today
[2:29:48] it's what the people do
[2:29:52] just They want something that's
[2:29:54] positive.
[2:29:57] They don't want to hear something
[2:29:58] contrary to what
[2:30:05] we are here to preach to you
[2:30:07] that your spirit
[2:30:10] may get into subjection
[2:30:14] to the spirit of God.
[2:30:17] that your flesh
[2:30:19] may submit
[2:30:22] to the spirit of God.
[2:30:24] Therefore, we have to preach God
[2:30:27] [Applause]
[2:30:32] no more.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; Enticing spirits.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; He says
[2:30:45] in paragraph 42,
[2:30:54] Now in the scripture,
[2:30:57] let me go to 40.
[2:31:01] Oh, if people could only realize
[2:31:04] that's why I come this morning
[2:31:07] and ask you to remember me as I go
[2:31:08] overseas.
[2:31:12] Someone who come the other day and said,
[2:31:15] "Brother Brham, you think it is wrong to
[2:31:18] do a certain thing?"
[2:31:21] I said, "Why do you question about
[2:31:26] there is a question in your mind?
[2:31:30] Leave it alone.
[2:31:33] Don't do it at all. Just stay with the
[2:31:36] doubt.
[2:31:37] When you start to do anything,
[2:31:41] And if it is a question whether it's
[2:31:43] right or wrong,
[2:31:46] stay away from it.
[2:31:49] Don't go into it at all.
[2:31:52] Then you know you are right.
[2:31:57] Amen.
[2:31:59] Now
[2:32:01] all things
[2:32:04] ought to be considered prayerfully.
[2:32:09] First,
[2:32:13] seek ye first
[2:32:16] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[2:32:21] and all these are things shall be added.
[2:32:27] It says all things
[2:32:30] have got to be considered prayerfully
[2:32:32] first.
[2:32:36] You don't just come to a conclusion.
[2:32:40] You don't just come to a judgment.
[2:32:43] You don't just cut off people anyhow.
[2:32:48] You don't just choose anyhow.
[2:32:51] You don't make decisions anyhow.
[2:32:54] You don't speak things anyhow.
[2:32:58] First do things anyhow.
[2:33:02] First consider it.
[2:33:07] Try by what spirit
[2:33:11] lying spirits
[2:33:13] go out into the people.
[2:33:16] They go out into the people
[2:33:18] and deceive them
[2:33:21] in the days of Jeremiah.
[2:33:24] Jeremiah was a prophet of God called of
[2:33:27] God.
[2:33:28] And Jeremiah received the word of God.
[2:33:32] God told him, "Go and tell the children
[2:33:35] of Israel
[2:33:37] 70 years
[2:33:39] they will go into captivity."
[2:33:44] After that,
[2:33:47] Jeremiah 25.
[2:33:49] Then in Jeremiah 28
[2:33:52] came
[2:33:55] and he broke the chains
[2:33:58] with such an anointing
[2:34:01] with such an anointing
[2:34:06] and says it shall be two years
[2:34:10] shall break the bones of captivity
[2:34:15] and bring you back in. Thus says the
[2:34:18] Lord.
[2:34:20] Amen.
[2:34:23] God perform his word.
[2:34:27] But
[2:34:28] it know
[2:34:32] the prophets that were before us
[2:34:39] and the prophets. The prophets that were
[2:34:41] before us. We know
[2:34:45] that if the prophet will say anything
[2:34:50] When it comes to pass,
[2:34:53] you shall believe him.
[2:34:56] Then God said Jeremiah
[2:34:59] and tell Ana
[2:35:02] because he has said that
[2:35:04] [Applause]
[2:35:06] he shall die.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; What was the matter?
[2:35:17] Yeah.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Thought it was God
[2:35:23] and he was so sincere
[2:35:27] and he came with such an inspiration
[2:35:31] and said the Lord two years
[2:35:34] but the prophet has said.
[2:35:38] Wow.
[2:35:40] Be careful brother sister.
[2:35:44] When God says anything,
[2:35:48] whether you believe it or not,
[2:35:51] be quiet.
[2:35:54] Don't say anything against it.
[2:35:58] Don't say anything against it.
[2:36:04] Lying spirits,
[2:36:07] they come amongst people here
[2:36:11] and they will each other, talk about one
[2:36:13] another. destroy each other, do this and
[2:36:16] that and push one another, kick each
[2:36:19] other in the home, rather against that.
[2:36:27] It's because of spirits.
[2:36:32] Someone has believed it.
[2:36:36] Someone who rise up with a certain
[2:36:38] doctrine
[2:36:40] and this one rises up with this.
[2:36:43] This one goes with that
[2:36:46] spirits.
[2:36:50] Janice and Jambra
[2:36:53] because they could do magic
[2:36:56] and enchantments.
[2:36:59] They thought they can do something.
[2:37:02] They thought they have God.
[2:37:05] They thought they have the power of God.
[2:37:08] and say the same thing
[2:37:11] as Dennis and with Moses.
[2:37:15] So the people with stand the truth.
[2:37:21] You can feel it
[2:37:24] that someone is withanding it.
[2:37:28] I always wonder
[2:37:31] when I tell someone
[2:37:34] that such is that this and that.
[2:37:38] And they say no. Then I ask him then
[2:37:40] what is it?
[2:37:43] Then they say I don't know. Then I say
[2:37:46] then you what is the matter?
[2:37:51] If it's not then what?
[2:37:55] You know if it's not the message then
[2:37:56] what?
[2:37:58] It's not Jesus then what?
[2:38:01] So God must vindicate your word.
[2:38:05] God must vicate your word.
[2:38:08] He must vindicate with your your deeds.
[2:38:13] They must show up in your deeds.
[2:38:16] Don't rise up to impersonate somebody.
[2:38:22] It's it's a spirits of impersonation.
[2:38:27] trying to act like someone
[2:38:30] do what someone does.
[2:38:33] Mount up to something.
[2:38:39] There's many people calling themselves
[2:38:41] today,
[2:38:43] things that they are not
[2:38:47] trying to do things they can't do.
[2:38:54] Honor things
[2:38:57] All spirits
[2:38:59] must be tried.
[2:39:02] All ministers
[2:39:04] must be tried.
[2:39:06] All sisters
[2:39:08] must be tried.
[2:39:10] All of brothers must be tried
[2:39:14] by the word and by the spirit.
[2:39:19] It does not mean that we don't believe
[2:39:20] that your brother
[2:39:24] doesn't mean that we don't believe your
[2:39:26] testimony.
[2:39:29] No,
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; we want to be certain
[2:39:33] because many false spirits have gone out
[2:39:35] into the world.
[2:39:39] Amen.
[2:39:41] I'll just leave out many of these
[2:39:43] things.
[2:39:46] I don't know. Let let me just read this
[2:39:48] quotation.
[2:39:51] God keeps his word.
[2:39:55] 1957
[2:39:58] paragraph 44.
[2:40:13] Prophet says, "I have the deepest and
[2:40:14] highest respects for women.
[2:40:21] My mother,
[2:40:24] my mother is one of them
[2:40:27] and my wife and I have young daughters
[2:40:32] and a woman that keeps her place
[2:40:36] and is a lady.
[2:40:40] There's nothing any more precious
[2:40:41] outside of salvation
[2:40:45] in our nation than a real woman.
[2:40:49] But when but when it comes to a place
[2:40:54] to worship women
[2:40:57] then you are out of the Bible plan
[2:41:01] and that's the age
[2:41:04] is woring women
[2:41:06] voting women
[2:41:09] employing women
[2:41:11] now sisters are saying brotherh
[2:41:16] Brother,
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you sisters.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about what you also know in
[2:41:21] the world.
[2:41:24] What does this people demand
[2:41:27] to be to employ these people
[2:41:30] is woriing women?
[2:41:32] Then you are out of the Bible plan.
[2:41:37] There's no woman. There's no plan in the
[2:41:39] Bible for us to worship any woman.
[2:41:42] A Mary or a St. Cecilia
[2:41:47] There's not one spec of the scripture
[2:41:49] for it.
[2:41:51] It's against the scripture.
[2:41:55] Then if this this was the beginning of
[2:41:57] this who walk with with Christ
[2:42:04] says now the minister or the priest who
[2:42:06] spoke to me said
[2:42:10] God is in his church.
[2:42:13] I said God is in his word.
[2:42:16] God is in his word. The Bible said so
[2:42:19] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:42:20] word
[2:42:23] and the word was God and the word was
[2:42:26] made fresh and brought among us.
[2:42:28] God is in his word not in the Old
[2:42:31] Testament.
[2:42:33] There are two ways of understanding a
[2:42:34] message to be correct
[2:42:38] that when a prophet prophesied
[2:42:41] or a dreamer dreamt a dream
[2:42:46] He told that before the breastplate of
[2:42:48] Aaron
[2:42:51] and he says
[2:42:53] that
[2:42:54] if when they were they used to go there
[2:42:57] and speak the vision
[2:43:02] dream
[2:43:04] if God vicated it
[2:43:07] the spirituality come from the temple
[2:43:11] and he vindicated the message was it
[2:43:15] If the light does not flash,
[2:43:19] no matter how realistic it seemed,
[2:43:22] no matter where it seemed to be,
[2:43:26] it seemed fitted together with the time.
[2:43:31] If the spiritual light on the did not
[2:43:33] flash,
[2:43:37] it was rejected
[2:43:40] because
[2:43:41] God was not in it.
[2:43:45] Then he says, "And I said today,
[2:43:48] oh, I want you to hear
[2:43:52] any message
[2:43:54] regarded." It was from priest.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; It was from priest.
[2:44:01] Oh, it was from preacher,
[2:44:04] from prophet, from anything,
[2:44:08] any man.
[2:44:10] No matter how spiritual,
[2:44:14] what his office is,
[2:44:18] what he has done,
[2:44:21] if he has raised the dead,
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; if he has healed the sick,
[2:44:27] if he is the archbishop of
[2:44:32] if he is the pope of Rome,
[2:44:35] if he's the head of a great
[2:44:36] denomination,
[2:44:39] no matter how spirit spiritual.
[2:44:42] Though he has spoke with tongues,
[2:44:46] though he has danced in the spirit,
[2:44:50] though he has preached the gospel,
[2:44:53] no matter what he has done,
[2:44:56] his message
[2:44:58] doesn't come out of the Bible.
[2:45:02] It is wrong.
[2:45:05] This is God's
[2:45:12] believers.
[2:45:14] We have got to be sober
[2:45:18] and sit strong.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; We are not people
[2:45:26] that is shaken by every wind.
[2:45:30] You say you are shaken because so and so
[2:45:32] so and so so and so. It's not about
[2:45:35] that.
[2:45:37] It's wrong.
[2:45:39] If it's not of the Bible,
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; Let's stand on our feet.
[2:45:53] We We just can't finish this.
[2:45:57] Let's just cut it off there.
[2:46:00] But if someone comes to you
[2:46:03] and acts in a certain way
[2:46:06] and you have the spirit of Christ,
[2:46:09] the prophet says in discernment of
[2:46:10] spirits
[2:46:12] that your own spiritual discernment
[2:46:16] will tell you that that's wrong.
[2:46:21] Amen. The Bible says the anointing that
[2:46:25] we have received
[2:46:29] the same anointing teaches us.
[2:46:35] Brother, sister,
[2:46:37] my intention of this message,
[2:46:41] my objective,
[2:46:46] the objective of this,
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to to to to to
[2:46:54] try the spirits
[2:46:57] to strike try the spirits
[2:47:03] because whatever things are done.
[2:47:06] All these things are done.
[2:47:10] Repent this, do this,
[2:47:14] speak this, all of this. What the
[2:47:17] spirits you are believing certain
[2:47:19] spirits.
[2:47:22] There is a spirit in you.
[2:47:26] There is a spirit leading you.
[2:47:29] There is a spirit making you to touch.
[2:47:33] Amen.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; And you don't want to discern that
[2:47:36] spirit.
[2:47:37] You don't want to.
[2:47:41] And you don't want to agree that wrong.
[2:47:45] A son of God when he's wrong is wrong.
[2:47:53] You accept I'm wrong. I'm wrong.
[2:48:01] Try the spirits.
[2:48:04] &gt;&gt; Don't just fly off to your husband.
[2:48:07] Don't just fly off to your husband.
[2:48:10] Fly off to your wife.
[2:48:17] Just try fast. the spirit
[2:48:20] you to do.
[2:48:25] These little things,
[2:48:27] little little things,
[2:48:30] they start that little
[2:48:32] a little heaven.
[2:48:36] Before you know
[2:48:39] it,
[2:48:41] [Applause]
[2:48:42] it goes from one sister
[2:48:45] to another sister.
[2:48:47] A sister dresses in a certain way.
[2:48:56] She walks in a certain way
[2:48:59] about a certain way. It goes to another
[2:49:02] sister.
[2:49:04] brother does this,
[2:49:06] goes around his sister, sister, that
[2:49:10] a sister tells this one, the other
[2:49:13] church,
[2:49:16] it is a spirit
[2:49:18] poisoning you.
[2:49:27] Try the spirits.
[2:49:30] Amen.
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; Try the spirits.
[2:49:34] Why the spirits
[2:49:36] start with the spirit in you?
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about it. I I won't
[2:49:47] even sing a song
[2:49:49] right now.
[2:49:51] I'm done now. I want you to think about
[2:49:53] it.
[2:49:56] Examine yourself.
[2:49:59] Judge yourself. Check yourself now.
[2:50:05] Judge yourself.
[2:50:07] Look into yourself.
[2:50:09] What you do,
[2:50:11] what you say, what you fills your mind,
[2:50:16] the decisions you are making today,
[2:50:19] the choice, the decision you are about
[2:50:21] to take,
[2:50:23] the choice you want to make,
[2:50:26] the things you are to do, what spirit is
[2:50:29] leading,
[2:50:34] I want you to go deeper,
[2:50:38] look around you
[2:50:40] just around your life you and God alone
[2:50:45] how many times you do things
[2:50:49] before you know you find little children
[2:50:51] are doing them also
[2:50:55] I'm talking to you mother
[2:50:58] I'm talking to you father
[2:51:00] you find they are doing it
[2:51:07] think about it brother
[2:51:10] How many times
[2:51:12] the things you do
[2:51:14] you find young men
[2:51:17] they are doing it
[2:51:19] thinking it is right
[2:51:21] because they think of you to be
[2:51:23] spiritual.
[2:51:26] You are corrupting the church.
[2:51:30] They think of you to be spiritual
[2:51:33] and you are driving them in the wrong
[2:51:35] way.
[2:51:38] Thank you for an example.
[2:51:41] They are watching you but you are
[2:51:44] believing certain spirit.
[2:51:46] How many times you sit around sisters
[2:51:50] talk to them about so and so
[2:51:54] and it flies over
[2:51:59] is a certain spirit.
[2:52:02] It's going to destroy us.
[2:52:05] Think about how many times
[2:52:09] God has warned you
[2:52:12] don't do that certain thing.
[2:52:14] Don't do it
[2:52:17] stubbornly do it
[2:52:20] over
[2:52:23] can you lay down now
[2:52:29] and unbelief
[2:52:31] like Peter who was sinking.
[2:52:34] I said, "Lord, help me.
[2:52:37] I don't want to do it."
[2:52:42] Think of all the times
[2:52:45] the pastor has told you.
[2:52:49] Stop that.
[2:52:53] But you don't want
[2:52:56] it's a certain spirit.
[2:53:00] How many smons I've waited for?
[2:53:05] calling you to come to God,
[2:53:08] but you are you are believing a wrong
[2:53:10] spirit.
[2:53:13] Telling you this is a lie.
[2:53:16] That spirit is the one who is lying.
[2:53:19] This is the truth.
[2:53:22] This is the word of God.
[2:53:24] Everyone just close your eyes.
[2:53:27] Keep your eyes closed.
[2:53:33] reently.
[2:53:37] [Music]
[2:53:39] Don't empty your mind.
[2:53:42] You say, "I'm emptying my mind.
[2:53:47] I'm emptying my mind." No, no, no. You
[2:53:49] will receive a wrong spirit.
[2:53:54] Have your mind sober.
[2:53:59] and say, "Lord Jesus, I come.
[2:54:02] I'm here, Lord.
[2:54:05] It's been many times
[2:54:07] that I've gone astray.
[2:54:10] It's been many times
[2:54:12] that I've not listened to your spirit.
[2:54:17] Listen my brother,
[2:54:19] there are times you come into a fix.
[2:54:23] But if you pray,
[2:54:26] even if you take a wrong decision,
[2:54:30] God will still come through and deliver.
[2:54:33] But if you didn't pray,
[2:54:36] he can't come through for you.
[2:54:40] Just surrender and say, "Lord,
[2:54:44] I want something real."
[2:54:47] Why do you take a wrong thing?
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; Why would you take a wrong spirit?
[2:54:55] When the heavens
[2:54:57] are full of Pentecostal blessings,
[2:55:02] you know that devil
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; that makes you think you are great
[2:55:06] brother
[2:55:09] that makes you think you are great
[2:55:11] sister.
[2:55:15] It's the flesh. It's nothing but clay.
[2:55:20] [Music]
[2:55:22] It will pass away.
[2:55:25] Just yield yourself
[2:55:29] and say, "Lord, I come
[2:55:33] just as I am.
[2:55:35] I pledge allegiance to the Lord.
[2:55:40] Speak to him.
[2:55:42] Speak to him.
[2:55:44] Don't just shut off. Shut off. Shut off.
[2:55:50] with Jesus.
[2:55:52] You may not have this moment tomorrow.
[2:55:57] You will say, "Brother, I will break
[2:55:59] through when I go back home."
[2:56:02] No, no, no, no.
[2:56:05] Break through now.
[2:56:08] I said, "Brother, when I go home,
[2:56:11] you have this moment." Oh, Lord, I take
[2:56:15] this moment.
[2:56:18] Just use the atmosphere.
[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I know you are here.
[2:56:25] Just start with me, Lord.
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; God, work on me
[2:56:31] [Music]
[2:56:32] to give me something real, a spiritual
[2:56:36] thing, Lord, that will not pass away
[2:56:38] from me.
