[33:20] ship fold
[33:22] but clamps up some other way the same is
[33:25] a thief and a robber
[33:27] but his thought enters in by the door is
[33:32] the shepherd of the ship to him
[33:35] the porter opens and the sheep hear his
[33:38] voice
[33:39] and he calls his own sheep by name
[33:42] and leads them out and when he puts
[33:45] forth his own sheep he goes before them
[33:49] and
[33:50] the sheep follow him for they know
[33:54] his voice and a stranger will thy not
[33:56] follow
[33:58] but will flee from him for they know not
[34:01] the voice of stranger yokana is
[34:16] [Music]
[34:46] foreign
[35:02] i really want to say thank you again for
[35:05] my beer pastor pastor talema and his
[35:08] fellow ministers
[35:13] it needs someone for you to give you a
[35:17] pulpit
[35:18] confused
[35:27] because pastor has confidence on my
[35:29] ministry
[35:33] now he's giving me the chance
[35:37] hallelujah
[35:39] i'm not a preacher like pastor talema
[35:54] and i'll bring that to you
[35:58] amen amen

[36:10] time day hallelujah
[36:13] we'll we will go deep into the world
[36:20] amen amen
[36:22] hallelujah
[36:24] what's my
[36:51] sometimes wisdom
[36:54] tries to copy
[36:56] as if it is faced
[37:02] but it is not actually faced
[37:06] hallelujah i mean so we shall see
[37:10] what is the difference between faith and
[37:12] wisdom
[37:18] and what do you want now a teacher will
[37:35] [Applause]
[37:46] because i have come out from the tree of
[37:48] life
[37:52] but
[37:54] i can't preach you
[37:55] know
[37:56] all the lies of the tree of wisdom
[38:01] again
[38:27] [Music]
[38:31] tuna again don't matter it is a service
[38:33] i have told you before
[38:36] you need to remain safe
[38:39] you will upgrade your face tonight
[38:44] you have already sacrificed the whole
[38:46] night to die today
[38:48] [Music]
[38:52] in written god will upgrade
[38:54] uplift your face
[39:12] album
[39:16] you can find that the prophet uh has
[39:19] preached us about faith and wisdom
[39:25] you might find it also there
[39:29] the whole sermon
[39:31] it has changed my life
[39:34] it has changed and opened my eyes to see
[39:37] what faith is
[39:52] we have seen that there are two uh
[39:57] there are two
[39:59] it talks about
[40:00] it talks about the ship and the shipper
[40:07] there is only one shepherd
[40:11] there are many ships
[40:13] [Music]
[40:14] but
[40:16] the real shepherd
[40:19] always comes to meet all the ships
[40:34] the other
[40:35] uh the other one
[40:37] [Music]
[40:58] if you are the true
[40:59] ships of
[41:01] god
[41:06] you will be able to hear only
[41:09] the voices of the shepherds
[41:15] because that true shepherd
[41:18] who is jesus christ
[41:21] he will call you by your name
[41:26] he cannot miss out your name
[41:31] hallelujah amen but that stranger
[41:35] he will create a new name for you
[41:39] and he will call you
[41:43] uh like a
[41:45] stranger name he will give you a strange
[41:47] name like the oddballs
[41:53] [Music]
[42:14] amen but the true shepherd our lord
[42:17] jesus christ
[42:21] he always calls us by calling upon our
[42:25] names
[42:30] that is how we differentiate the voice
[42:33] that comes out from the stranger and the
[42:35] voice that comes out from the true
[42:38] shepherd
[42:51] [Applause]
[43:10] [Music]
[43:38] he
[44:14] they have been also introduced in
[44:16] genesis
[44:48] from the tree of
[44:50] [Music]
[44:55] [Music]
[45:00] we find that the source of wisdom is
[45:03] from the tree of knowledge
[45:08] hallelujah
[45:11] so who is the source of faith
[45:43] so that's why she is a source of wisdom
[45:49] that is the battle
[45:51] that is the battle
[45:53] of fights
[45:56] hallelujah amen
[45:58] two tonight
[46:00] we have to start
[46:02] uh
[46:04] to understand or we have to start to
[46:06] know
[46:07] which kind of
[46:08] voice we are hearing
[46:26] in different ways
[46:58] you choose to come here and to to come
[47:00] here oh
[47:02] no
[47:02] and to listen from the the tree of life
[47:09] it takes your decision wait where's
[47:11] salida ahmed amen
[47:14] hallelujah hallelujah but sometimes
[47:17] [Music]
[47:18] even
[47:19] as a believer no more
[47:22] we might
[47:33] so what are these voices all those
[47:36] voices that comes out from the wisdom
[47:42] we have to differentiate tonight
[47:50] is
[48:46] everything that god has put on
[48:50] life
[48:55] that is how it works
[49:02] when we go back in in genesis
[49:06] in genesis chapter three verse one up to
[49:08] five
[49:11] we can see one scenario
[49:24] you remember the story between what
[49:26] happened between eve and the
[49:38] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[49:41] business of the field which the lord god
[49:44] had made
[49:45] and he said unto the woman
[49:47] he has god said he shall not eat off
[49:51] every tree of the garden
[49:53] and the woman said unto the serpent
[49:56] we may eat of the fruits of the trees of
[49:58] the garden but of the fruits of the tree
[50:02] which is in the midst of the garden god
[50:05] has said he shall not eat of it
[50:07] neither shall he touch it lest he die
[50:11] and the serpent
[50:13] said unto the women ye shall not surely
[50:16] die
[50:17] for god does know that in the day ye eat
[50:20] thereof
[50:21] then your eyes shall be opened
[50:24] and it shall be as good
[50:26] knowing good and evil
[51:07] [Music]
[51:20] hallelujah there is a mystery in this
[51:23] scripture one way to sue me right away
[51:25] charmer one of the revealed mysteries in
[51:27] this scripture
[51:31] is found in genesis
[51:45] [Music]
[52:02] korean
[52:04] or killing
[52:06] these all are the fruits or the
[52:09] attributes of sin
[52:11] together
[52:14] but what is sin now
[52:27] because that's what we see in chapter
[52:29] three
[52:32] [Applause]
[53:25] but we eat by our ears
[53:29] number two
[53:30] like what we are doing now
[53:33] you are eating the word of god
[53:37] not by your mouth
[53:54] that was just what happened in a garden
[53:58] garden
[54:01] you see
[54:03] earth has been deceived by the serpent
[54:08] um
[54:17] because the serpent asked her
[54:20] has god said
[54:22] ye shall not eat off every tree of the
[54:24] garden
[54:32] after she told him that we can't eat
[54:34] every tree over there the fruits of the
[54:36] trees of the garden but except this and
[54:39] things like that but verse four it says
[54:42] and the serpent said anthocyanin you
[54:44] shall not truly die
[55:15] they have a bible
[55:18] their
[55:26] [Music]
[55:33] there is no need to write genesis exodus
[55:35] any other books
[55:39] there is no need to write new testament
[55:42] all the testimonies
[55:45] because in the beginning there was no
[55:53] [Applause]
[55:59] god said
[56:01] you shall
[56:02] die
[56:06] if you eat from the trees
[56:09] if not you shall live
[56:13] that is the only scripture
[56:16] that was the only
[56:18] word
[56:21] but what did she say
[56:25] she
[56:26] trespassed
[56:28] by believing
[56:31] as if she is not going to die
[56:40] you see
[56:41] this is the tree of wisdom
[56:46] against the wasting the word of god
[56:52] just a little bit
[56:55] just a little bit
[57:09] but that little twist
[57:23] that's why we don't
[57:24] allow javon to kill his at this age
[57:29] or during the whole seven church ages
[57:33] that's why we do not allow
[57:35] for any man
[57:38] to add to deduct from the word of god
[57:49] we accept it as it is a hundred percent
[58:03] if has
[58:05] a hundred percent full face on her god
[58:09] singer
[58:14] she would have refused
[58:16] that voice that comes from the tree of
[58:19] wisdom
[58:27] [Music]
[58:52] that is the only thing that can help us
[58:54] in our life
[59:00] you see whatever since god is out of
[59:03] faith
[59:07] what he has been doing from genesis
[59:10] until revelation
[59:15] is just uplifting the face of his own
[59:18] children
[59:22] whenever the devil
[59:26] and you know source another seed
[59:29] i never take away
[59:45] his children his face upon him
[59:50] hallelujah
[59:51] that is what he is going to do tonight
[59:54] for you

[1:12:24] that's why every time when we think we
[1:12:27] are enough for
[1:12:29] when we think we are we have a big faith
[1:12:32] on our lord
[1:12:34] god comes with another temptation
[1:12:45] there is there are three steps that we
[1:12:48] learn from
[1:12:49] abraham's life
[1:12:54] what did abraham do
[1:12:58] abraham
[1:12:59] he took his two young men
[1:13:16] young
[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:13] i want you to catch up something there
[1:14:15] is a real evaluation here
[1:14:20] they have come
[1:14:21] together
[1:14:25] abraham
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:53] which means me and my son
[1:14:56] will go yonder category
[1:14:59] on the mountain
[1:15:01] on the mountain
[1:15:03] and what we will do together
[1:15:06] i want to hear something what we will do
[1:15:30] whenever you are asked by jesus christ
[1:15:33] to offer
[1:15:34] the blessings that you have received
[1:15:36] previously
[1:15:38] whenever god asks you i request you to
[1:15:42] offer
[1:15:43] what has been bless you
[1:15:50] you don't
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:17] whatever he is doing in his life
[1:16:21] he knew that it is just worshipping of
[1:16:23] god yeah
[1:16:25] i see that
[1:16:27] so that's why
[1:16:29] if i'm going to yonder up on the
[1:16:31] mountain
[1:16:44] thing in my life
[1:17:03] amina
[1:17:05] she said
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:07] after we worship
[1:17:11] he know that he is going to kill his own
[1:17:29] amen
[1:17:32] what did he say yeah
[1:17:34] we worship and wake up
[1:17:36] again together
[1:17:38] to marry to come including his son
[1:17:42] someone
[1:17:53] he knows that god can create even
[1:17:55] another man
[1:18:08] amen
[1:18:11] we will go on that and worship together
[1:18:14] to see
[1:18:15] and come again to you tomorrow to
[1:18:17] commemorate your movie
[1:18:19] tell the devil
[1:18:21] whatever you have sacrificed for the
[1:18:23] lord
[1:18:38] hallelujah
[1:18:45] this is the first step that we can see
[1:18:47] from life of abraham
[1:18:51] okay
[1:18:54] what is the second step
[1:18:58] let us go to the first seven category
[1:19:03] let us took verse seven or okay let us
[1:19:06] read from verse 6
[1:19:10] and abraham took the wood off the burnet
[1:19:12] offering
[1:19:14] and laid it up on isaac
[1:19:17] his son
[1:19:19] and he took the fire in his hand
[1:19:23] and a knife
[1:19:25] and they went to both of them together
[1:19:42] isaac does not know that this even
[1:19:46] fire this wood everything that has been
[1:19:48] prepared
[1:20:01] to sacrifice a permanent offering maybe
[1:20:04] some kind of ship
[1:20:11] that is what he has been seeing during
[1:20:14] his when he has been grown up with
[1:20:16] abraham
[1:20:21] there is no possible way that the isaac
[1:20:25] will think that his father will
[1:20:27] sacrifice him or offer him
[1:20:59] of them together
[1:21:03] on your room
[1:21:04] here is a question that comes arise
[1:21:08] here is a voice that you need to answer
[1:21:10] back
[1:22:07] and he will come back they
[1:22:21] god will provide
[1:22:50] does abraham know that god has prepared
[1:22:52] a lamp on the mountain
[1:23:00] but he is a seed of god
[1:23:24] what is the situation
[1:23:27] he's in a situation where he is going to
[1:23:29] lose or where he is he might lose his
[1:23:32] son yarimum

[1:25:26] you know that it is also a symbolic or
[1:25:29] it was a shadow for the comings of jesus
[1:25:31] christ and the father and son
[1:25:33] relationship
[1:25:49] isaac was representing jesus christ
[1:25:52] himself

[1:26:20] hallelujah
[1:26:24] amen amen
[1:26:27] oh lord jesus christ help us tonight
[1:26:30] and they came to the place which god
[1:26:32] verse 9 had told him off and abraham
[1:26:36] built an altar there and led the wood in
[1:26:39] order and bound isaac his son
[1:26:42] and lied him on the altar upon the wood
[1:26:46] and abraham stretched force his hand
[1:26:50] and took the knife
[1:26:52] to slay his son

[1:29:07] and god does not break his principles
[1:29:13] let me show you something
[1:29:15] do you know that in the old testament or
[1:29:18] in any scripture
