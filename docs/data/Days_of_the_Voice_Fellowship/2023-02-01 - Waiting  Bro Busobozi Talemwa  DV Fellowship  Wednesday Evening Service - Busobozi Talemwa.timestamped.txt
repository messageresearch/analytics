[6:29] amen Amina
[6:31] we are taking Isaiah 40.
[6:34] today
[6:37] is
[6:41] and we are reading verse
[6:44] from verses 31 actually yesterday in
[6:48] verse 31
[6:49] .
[6:56] everybody there
[7:00] [Music]
[7:18] let us begin from verse 30.
[7:23] even the youth shall faint and be wary
[7:27] and the young men shall utterly fall
[7:31] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[7:34] renew their strength they shall Mount up
[7:37] with wings as egos they shall run and
[7:40] not be weary and they shall walk and not
[7:43] faint
[7:47] Ed
[7:55] foreign
[7:59] foreign
[8:02] [Music]
[8:08] [Music]
[8:16] if you look at verse 29 he says he
[8:20] giveth power to the faint and to them
[8:22] that have no might he increases strength
[8:26] foreign
[8:32] foreign
[9:09] I'm seeing different ones we prefer back
[9:12] seats you know on Wednesday when people
[9:15] are not more it's better we come and
[9:17] take the front seats that everybody is
[9:19] close and we are compacted together
[9:28] foreign
[9:37] I want to speak on today is waiting
[9:40] um
[9:54] yes what about when I say wait
[9:58] wait Linda yeah
[10:02] you know he knows too much luganda so he
[10:04] expounds it sometimes
[10:07] wait Linda SO waiting
[10:14] Linda
[10:19] waiting okay
[10:21] yes I think that's the word
[10:30] what does it say but they that wait upon
[10:33] the Lord
[10:41] it is the present continuous
[10:44] okay okay
[10:47] sister Grace
[10:55] amen all right
[10:57] but the day that you wait upon the Lord
[11:01] I'm happy to see brothers
[11:05] and uh also brother Gideon God bless you
[11:09] thank you for coming and I'm happy to
[11:11] see every one of you themselves
[11:13] these young men they've not been coming
[11:15] on Wednesday for some time
[11:18] but the day that wait upon the Lord
[11:21] shall renew their strength
[11:23] they shall Mount up with wings as egos
[11:26] they shall run and not be weary they
[11:28] shall walk and not faint
[11:30] Ness
[11:37] [Music]
[11:52] but even the youth shall faint
[11:57] sometimes we think you know when people
[12:00] are older sometimes they can lose
[12:02] balance and fall off all
[12:08] and that's what happens
[12:11] the older ones the older you get the
[12:14] more vulnerable you are
[12:18] but you see even the Bible says even the
[12:21] young even the youths
[12:28] and even the youth be wary
[12:32] and even the younger men shall utterly
[12:34] fall nobody is
[12:37] meaning that to each of us whether you
[12:40] are old or young
[12:43] you are not sufficient in yourself
[12:49] that you need an extra help
[12:52] you need God to give you strength and
[12:56] Grace
[12:59] sometimes you might be wary
[13:03] it is Spirit or in your soul or in your
[13:06] body
[13:07] and you need extra strength
[13:14] and you feel you need strength from the
[13:16] Lord
[13:18] may be your friend
[13:21] and the Bible says that but you see if
[13:24] they that wait upon the Lord
[13:28] [Music]
[13:36] as long as we wait upon the Lord
[13:39] we will always renew our strength
[13:53] now there are many benefits of waiting
[13:58] room one thing to note however is
[14:01] waiting is never fun
[14:06] see the longer you wait
[14:09] the stronger the feeling of being a
[14:11] loser
[14:13] is
[14:16] the longer you wait the worse you feel
[14:22] how many have ever waited
[14:30] all right so all of you have stood in a
[14:32] line or in a queue and you waited for
[14:34] something
[14:37] what were you waiting for
[14:41] food someone was waiting for food and
[14:45] you know when you are hungry and you're
[14:47] standing in a queue
[14:50] you you can't pass the others that came
[14:54] before you
[14:56] even if you have answers
[15:00] and you you begin complaining around
[15:04] I have outside I'm actually feeling not
[15:08] well at all
[15:09] at least they should have let me pass
[15:12] if you try to pass somebody else will
[15:15] tell you please please
[15:22] and especially when here in Africa when
[15:25] someone has died
[15:30] many people who don't don't even have an
[15:33] association with the person who died
[15:35] they want to come and eat food
[15:37] [Music]
[15:41] and they are usually the first in the
[15:44] queue
[15:46] when even when they are last or in the
[15:49] middle somewhere
[15:51] they will try to sneak their way out of
[15:54] the queue so that they can be in the
[15:56] front
[15:58] because they don't want to wait
[16:01] they know somebody can eye them and
[16:03] maybe chase them away
[16:09] in the bank
[16:11] and maybe there are those tellers that
[16:14] really serve slowly slowly slowly
[16:22] 10 minutes
[16:24] sometimes even one hour
[16:27] and you feel like fainting I remember
[16:30] when I was in Ethiopia
[16:33] Ethiopia my my wife I think we had about
[16:37] two children then those um
[16:40] and so we had Elizabeth and the ship I
[16:43] don't know where they're here
[16:46] so Elizabeth was very good at crying
[16:52] so when we would stand at um at the
[16:56] immigration queue
[16:58] immigration it was a very long queue
[17:02] but you know what I used to do
[17:05] yes I remember that time at that time my
[17:08] wife was pregnant for uh
[17:11] foreign
[17:21] [Music]
[18:26] and
[18:28] at that moment I knew indeed waiting we
[18:32] were not going to wait no more foreign
[18:44] [Music]
[19:04] [Music]
[19:16] nobody likes waiting
[19:19] if you want something you want it
[19:21] immediately
[19:23] if you ask if you're a child and you ask
[19:25] your parents for money and you're going
[19:27] to school you want it there and then
[19:30] [Music]
[19:31] if you want a job you want it now
[19:35] if you want a husband or a wife you want
[19:37] her or him now
[19:41] whatever you you want you want it now
[19:45] so thus waiting is not a good thing for
[19:48] most of us
[19:51] and the longer you wait the the worse
[19:54] you feel
[19:57] but if you read in the Bible
[20:00] and you look at history
[20:04] or even Bible History
[20:07] every person of substance waited
[20:15] Everest person
[20:17] there was a person of substance
[20:21] they waited
[20:25] nobody received what they wanted to
[20:27] receive there an event
[20:31] they waited
[20:35] and I'm going to take you down a journey
[20:38] tonight
[20:41] we will not be long as usual
[20:44] I consider myself not to be a very long
[20:47] preacher the network
[20:50] and so I trust that you will follow me
[20:53] along tonight
[20:58] let us begin with a quote but the banham
[21:00] says but it was done the Hebrew children
[21:02] but they never tempt the Lord thy God
[21:04] they was just thrown into it they didn't
[21:06] try to manufacture something
[21:14] and he says that's what's the matter
[21:17] with the Pentecostals today
[21:20] they are manufacturing something
[21:23] into they can't wait
[21:26] you see they are manufacturing something
[21:28] they can't wait
[21:30] and he says oh God they just can't wait
[21:35] so they commit adultery
[21:38] tell us to manufacture something never
[21:41] uses
[21:42] stairs
[21:46] and what does it bring forth
[21:49] like it did the first time the first
[21:51] bride that couldn't wait
[21:56] I will get deep into
[22:10] he says the first bride could not wait
[22:17] that is talking about Eve
[22:19] could not wait and because she could not
[22:23] wait
[22:24] she went into adultery again and then
[22:28] she was able to get bastard children
[22:33] and he says we all are a part of that
[22:37] okay I'll expound it as we go on but God
[22:40] came in the flesh
[22:43] but God Came In the Flesh
[22:45] to give us another bus
[22:49] God Came In the Flesh to bring us back
[22:51] to the original Sons and Daughters of
[22:53] God
[22:57] you see he says that
[23:00] um okay the lifespan of Eve never
[23:03] happened it never did why she mingled it
[23:06] kept it away instead of Adam coming to
[23:09] her for a bride when the time appointed
[23:12] would be
[23:13] just like Christ's will would have come
[23:16] to the group Christ would have come to
[23:19] his church he promised to do it
[23:22] I mean did you get it no you see Adam
[23:25] Adam was the husband to this bride yes
[23:30] and he was supposed to give
[23:35] seeds you remember what God promised
[23:37] Adam
[23:40] in the beginning in Genesis
[23:44] what did God promise them God tell them
[23:47] he told them multiply
[23:54] and remember by this time Adam and Eve
[23:57] was not flesh and blood
[24:01] how are they going to accomplish that
[24:04] just the same way but God brought forth
[24:09] his children
[24:10] by the spoken word
[24:13] because the spoken word is the original
[24:18] but what happened
[24:20] while they waited already in that for
[24:24] the appointed time I can say that
[24:26] cartoon because someone told me oh if
[24:28] that was the purpose why didn't they
[24:30] have children before
[24:31] [Music]
[24:35] but you see that had not yet been the
[24:38] appointed time
[24:41] because before the appointed time for
[24:44] that to be accomplished
[24:53] and the serpent gave a better options
[25:05] and then see what came through
[25:09] bastard children
[25:11] do you know that we all are born as
[25:14] bastard children
[25:26] [Music]
[25:28] it doesn't matter how your parents were
[25:31] before they gave birth to you since
[25:45] you were born according to the last of
[25:47] the flesh
[25:49] the Bible says we were born in sins
[25:52] we come to the word speaking lies
[25:56] that is why we still have these Desires
[25:59] in us
[26:04] the Bible calls it the pride of life
[26:08] the last of the Flesh and the last of
[26:11] the eyes
[26:12] each human being has that
[26:16] it is a part because each of you has
[26:18] that part of serpency
[26:21] [Music]
[26:23] and that is the flesh because the flesh
[26:26] is
[26:28] this is not the image of God
[26:32] some person was saying oh you know I'm
[26:34] in the image of God
[26:37] the image of God is not this dying flesh
[26:41] of God God because he's born into your
[26:45] nature
[26:49] when you hear the word of God and
[26:51] believe it
[26:53] and then you receive the holy ghost that
[26:57] is the image of God right there in your
[26:59] soul
[27:02] but you see the way we were born
[27:07] we were all born needing to be safe
[27:12] we were all born with that part of the
[27:14] world
[27:18] the reason was
[27:20] the first bride did not wait
[27:24] the Bride of Adam did not wait
[27:28] you see so she did not bring the
[27:32] original Sons and Daughters of God
[27:35] [Music]
[27:39] bastard children
[27:41] but here he says but God Came In the
[27:44] Flesh
[27:46] you give us another bar at work
[27:51] to bring us back to the original Sons
[27:54] and Daughters of God to come here
[27:59] hallelujah amen and that's why I said no
[28:01] matter how evil we are or how bad we are
[28:04] traveling
[28:06] you see as a child of God you must never
[28:10] accept to defeat foreign
[28:38] foreign
[29:05] foreign
[29:09] this brought bastards into the world as
[29:12] a result
[29:14] like I said we all are bastards
[29:18] by nature
[29:21] but our souls
[29:28] do you understand that your soul
[29:31] the inside of you
[29:34] the man within the man within the man
[29:40] but the spirit souls
[29:46] in God before the foundation of the
[29:49] world
[29:52] that soul in me in you in us
[29:57] all the children of God
[30:01] in God before the foundation of the
[30:03] world
[30:05] but now when we we were born in the
[30:08] flesh
[30:09] so we found talking of our souls we
[30:13] found ourselves as a victim of
[30:14] circumstances
[30:19] so we found ourselves chained Praise In
[30:24] Chains of sins we found ourselves you
[30:28] know in Prison Press you see that's why
[30:32] we preached that's why there is
[30:33] preaching of the gospel
[30:36] because the preaching of the gospel
[30:40] songs
[30:46] free
[30:51] setting the captives
[31:36] [Applause]
[31:49] actually he says that the spirit of the
[31:52] Lord God is upon me
[32:13] the purpose of Jesus Christ was on Earth
[32:18] so our soul that we are a victim of
[32:20] circumstances
[32:31] you see he made an unfailing way for
[32:34] those Souls that were in prison
[32:39] an unfailing way for them to be set free
[32:42] 30 minutes
[32:45] and how does it set them free by giving
[32:48] them a new bath
[32:51] by giving you a new
[32:56] you may not
[32:58] someone may tell you against this
[33:01] message
[33:05] but we are the proof that what I'm
[33:08] telling you is the truth
[33:12] that God can still set Souls free
[33:17] do you believe you are one of those
[33:19] Souls that are set free
[33:22] the name of the Lord
[33:25] something is happening today with you
[33:28] know young people that wouldn't wait
[33:37] just a little bit
[33:38] all right so we see that some you know
[33:41] uh they end up you know because
[33:44] physically speaking now they end up they
[33:46] can't wait you know waiting for marriage
[33:49] waiting or you're waiting waiting or
[33:51] they can't wait
[33:58] and so they end up in fornication and
[34:00] immorality
[34:04] but remember
[34:06] failing to wait like Eve's case has
[34:09] consequences
[34:19] the devil would love to give us a quick
[34:22] way out
[34:25] and then after that he leaves you to eat
[34:29] when it comes to the consequences
[34:35] when you are walking in sin and in the
[34:37] Journey of not waiting
[34:40] [Music]
[34:41] you are walking there with the Devil
[34:43] foreign
[34:45] but when the consequences when the time
[34:48] for the consequences has come now
[34:53] the devil runs away
[34:56] leaves you alone in your Constitution
[35:02] friends I'd like us to see an example
[35:05] here
[35:10] that did not wait
[35:14] turn with me to the book of First Samuel
[35:17] foreign
[35:56] okay look at verse five let us begin
[35:58] from verse five somewhere so
[36:01] so
[36:04] and the Philistines gathered
[36:06] themselves together to fight with Israel
[36:09] 30 000 chariots and six thousand
[36:11] Horsemen and people as the sandwiches on
[36:14] the seashore in multitude and they came
[36:16] up and pitched in mishmash Eastward from
[36:19] Beethoven
[36:41] when the men of Israel saw that they
[36:44] were in a straight
[36:46] for the people were distressed then the
[36:49] people did die themselves in caves and
[36:51] thickets and in rocks and in high places
[36:53] and in pits ourselves
[37:06] and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan
[37:09] to the land of God and Gilead as for
[37:12] Saul he was yet in gilgal and all the
[37:15] people followed him trembling is
[37:30] and so the Philistine Army had come to
[37:33] attack the Israelites
[37:37] and you remember how Saul was chosen as
[37:41] a man to lead Israel
[37:45] of course it was at a time that Israel
[37:48] wanted to have a man to rule over them
[37:54] and yet God was their King
[37:57] and so God told his Prophet don't worry
[38:00] they have not rejected you but they have
[38:01] rejected me
[38:05] but you remember last time we talked
[38:07] about how Saul was elected as a king
[38:13] it was God that elected him and chose
[38:17] him to be a king I will not go in the
[38:20] whole story
[38:21] but then he became the king of Israel
[38:25] but now here I want us to look at souls
[38:29] he finds himself in a straight in a
[38:32] place
[38:34] where he needs to exercise waiting
[38:39] let me tell you to each of us Believers
[38:42] anybody took
[39:10] I want you to see the children of Israel
[39:12] were following Soul they were all
[39:14] fearful they were all trembling
[39:19] and then they went on up to gilgals
[39:23] and so the Bible verse 8 says and he
[39:26] tarried seven days according to the set
[39:29] time that Samuel had appointed but
[39:32] someone else came not to gilgal and the
[39:34] people were scattered from him
[39:50] offering to me and peace offerings and
[39:53] he offered the bad offering and it came
[39:54] to pass that as soon as he had made an
[39:57] end of the offering of the offering the
[39:59] of offering the bad offering behold
[40:02] Samuel came and and Saul went out to
[40:05] meet him that he might salute him
[40:08] and someone said what has thou done and
[40:11] so said because I saw that the people
[40:13] were scattered from me and the thou
[40:15] cameest not within the days appointed
[40:17] and that the Philistines gathered
[40:18] themselves together a at mismatch
[40:20] thereafter said I the Philistines will
[40:23] come down now upon me to give God and I
[40:25] have not made supplication unto the Lord
[40:27] I forced myself thereof and offered a
[40:29] bad offering
[40:31] foreign
[41:28] and verse 12 says therefore said I the
[41:31] Philistines will come down upon me to
[41:32] gilgalan I have not made supplications
[41:34] unto the Lord I forced myself to have an
[41:36] offered about offering and someone said
[41:38] thou has done foolishly thou has not
[41:40] kept the Commandment of the Lord like
[41:42] God which he commanded thee for now
[41:44] would the Lord have established thy
[41:46] kingdom upon Israel forever but now the
[41:48] kingdom shall not continue the Lord has
[41:50] sought him a man after his own heart and
[41:52] the Lord has commanded him to be Captain
[41:54] over the over his people because thou
[41:57] has not kept that which the Lord
[41:59] commanded thee somewhere because
[42:28] foreign
[43:04] the children of Israeli
[43:07] as I told you they were all shivering
[43:09] and shaking
[43:10] [Music]
[43:12] and they came following their kings
[43:15] and soul knew very well that he was the
[43:18] king
[43:20] but he was not the prophet
[43:22] he was the king not the prophet
[43:28] but as he stood there in gilgals
[43:31] the prophet had told him to wait for
[43:34] seven days
[43:36] it was the work of a prophet to give or
[43:40] offer sacrifice
[43:42] [Music]
[43:46] amen and then we see that as as
[43:50] someone who tarried
[43:55] I'm imagining the Bible says for seven
[43:58] days
[44:00] the first day Russell people were
[44:03] tumbling the Philistines were coming
[44:06] back and you know they needed to give an
[44:09] offering
[44:10] so that they can go and fight
[44:13] you see this is how children of God
[44:15] fight their battles
[44:19] you you must give an offering to them
[44:23] that's why we come in the church to
[44:25] praise him to cry for him to jump to do
[44:27] all these things to hear the word we are
[44:28] giving an offering to them
[44:34] and so as they were
[44:36] they were up in gilgore
[44:39] whether the first day
[44:42] the prophet was looking I mean the King
[44:44] was looking around
[44:48] the prophet was not coming okay just
[44:51] wait for the second the second day
[44:57] the third day
[45:06] what was that what was the last day
[45:10] foreign
[45:32] [Music]
[45:44] [Applause]
[46:04] foreign
[47:04] foreign
[47:05] [Music]
[47:44] I'm smiling because I'm waiting
[47:48] brother why are you smiling
[47:51] because I'm waiting
[48:03] you're just moving
[48:05] I'm imagining this is how King's Soul
[48:08] was
[48:12] he didn't even know where to swim
[48:43] that was a mistake
[48:46] he did not wait
[48:50] and when they brought the offering the
[48:53] man gave it to himself
[49:16] thank you
[49:18] and he was tying an apron on himself
[49:22] and then the prophet arrived the Bible
[49:24] says at the moment
[49:44] this King could not wait long enough
[49:51] and then the man of God was hungry
[49:55] when the prophet arrived he told him
[50:01] what have you done
[50:09] because the king the prophet knew
[50:12] what the king did he was so Grievous to
[50:17] the Lord
[50:21] the prophet knew what the king did not
[50:24] know
[50:26] it wasn't just about the sacrifice
[50:30] it was also about the right anointed
[50:33] anointing for the office
[50:38] you see you may feel like you want to do
[50:40] something even better than your pastor
[50:42] sometimes
[50:45] but the question is I is that your right
[50:48] office
[50:49] [Music]
[50:51] you may feel in your home
[50:54] you are more knowledgeable than your
[50:56] father or singer that one against you
[50:58] are better than your mother you want to
[51:01] even do everything and devise everybody
[51:02] around
[51:04] but is that your right to office
[51:08] you always have to wait foreign
[51:22] what have you done
[51:25] a king was but uh you see on my knee
[51:30] I saw the people were scattered
[51:33] and you were not coming in today
[51:36] and the Philistines gathered themselves
[51:39] together
[51:45] I said
[51:49] who are you to say if God wants you to
[51:52] wait wait
[51:54] [Music]
[51:56] foreign
[52:36] [Music]
[52:40] and now you're saying I forced myself
[52:43] he was impatient
[52:46] he didn't wait long enough
[52:52] and the king the prophet said
[52:55] someone said unto so
[52:57] you have done foolishly
[53:02] you have not obeyed the command you have
[53:04] not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy
[53:06] God
[53:07] and now the kingdom would have been with
[53:09] you forever
[53:13] but according to what you have done
[53:16] your kingdom shall not continue
[53:20] the Lord has sought him a man after his
[53:23] own hammock
[53:26] [Music]
[53:27] seven is a number of completions
[53:32] it might seem that summer was no longer
[53:35] coming to fulfill his place
[53:39] but it was foolish for Saul to stop
[53:42] waiting
[53:45] and where are we today
[53:48] we are in the seventh age
[53:54] we are in the last day
[53:56] we are the last day of waiting
[54:01] the very last time
[54:04] I seem as if Christ is not going to come
[54:07] Christian
[54:09] but he told us he is going to come back
[54:13] again
[54:14] we are not going to be like those who
[54:17] don't believe let's pray
[54:19] we don't want to be impatient
[54:22] we don't want to live as though Jesus is
[54:25] not coming back
[54:28] we want to live as though we believe
[54:32] that on the last day on the last day of
[54:37] the seventh gentle generation
[54:42] there was the first age that was the
[54:45] second age
[54:50] that God was dealing with a gentle child

[59:58] actually let me say for six days
[1:00:02] and 23 hours
[1:00:05] perhaps I can put it that way and that
[1:00:09] last two hours
[1:00:14] and that's when the prophet arrives
[1:00:17] the Bible says that the day of the Lord
[1:00:19] will be as a thief in the night
[1:00:24] men will be on the sowing

[1:05:18] design it we can take care of our
[1:05:20] families and do other things

[1:05:32] coming of the Lord the preparation for

[1:07:13] preaching
[1:07:15] okay we should go and pray but before we
[1:07:18] do that let us go and talk to the pastor
[1:07:21] and then when you go to the pasta you
[1:07:25] find there is
[1:07:26] a forsaken house
[1:07:32] maybe the pastor has gone somewhere with

[1:08:39] before you tell the others
[1:08:51] all right
[1:08:53] before you even want to say
[1:09:01] you will cry three years

[1:10:57] coming of the Lord
[1:11:01] so that he can give me a new birth in

[1:12:33] there's even another one God has ready
[1:12:34] to prepare
[1:12:39] when did God prepare him
[1:12:45] he know that the king would do this
[1:12:48] God knows all things
[1:12:54] the next thing
[1:12:55] is
[1:12:56] the next thing
[1:12:58] waiting is for that elected and called
[1:13:01] out Seed of Abraham
[1:13:03] [Music]
[1:13:12] the infestation of God among his people
[1:13:18] and waiting narinda

[1:14:24] my home do that fair City
[1:14:30] When the Saints Go much
[1:14:35] and then the prophet told him the king
[1:14:38] God has even prepared
[1:14:43] says that you see these people they did
[1:14:45] not wait and because they didn't wait
[1:14:47] they denominated they formed the
[1:14:49] organizations
[1:14:57] the former wife of king of assurance
[1:15:08] and so the king she would not have the
[1:15:10] life of the king
[1:15:13] the king put her away
[1:15:16] and brought him another himself another
[1:15:18] one
[1:15:19] another bride another queen another
[1:15:23] queen that would obey him
[1:15:25] that you would do his will
[1:15:28] and that was Queen Esther
[1:15:35] God has given to us
[1:15:37] the calling
[1:15:39] to be in the anointing that Queen Esther
[1:15:43] was in
[1:15:46] to be the bride in waiting
[1:15:50] we are the one that he is coming foreign
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:35] okay in in 20 minutes let me let me take
[1:16:37] you through this let us see first Samuel
[1:16:39] chapter 13 verse 14 but now the kingdom
[1:16:42] shall not continue here is when God is
[1:16:45] choosing David now the kingdom shall not
[1:16:48] continue the Lord has sought him and a
[1:16:49] man after his own heart and the Lord has
[1:16:52] commanded him to be Captain over his
[1:16:53] people because thou has not kept that
[1:16:55] which the Lord commanded thee on your
[1:16:57] recommendation
[1:17:09] so here was God choosing David
[1:17:16] did David know
[1:17:18] these words were being spoken by soul to
[1:17:22] King Saul by somewhere to King Saul
[1:17:29] are you following me
[1:17:32] and the King
[1:17:34] Saul was the one who was rejected by God
[1:17:39] and God was telling him I've now chosen
[1:17:41] another one
[1:17:45] foreign
[1:17:55] yes
[1:17:58] yes he was a Shepherd
[1:18:01] somewhere in a bush
[1:18:05] he didn't know what God was planning
[1:18:11] but he was waiting
[1:18:14] waiting before he even knew the plan of
[1:18:16] God for his life
[1:18:20] you may tell me yes I don't know what I
[1:18:22] should wait for what what God intends
[1:18:24] for my life I don't know the plan of God
[1:18:26] just wait my name is
[1:18:32] you do not know anything you're going to
[1:18:34] be two years from now but wait upon the
[1:18:37] Lord
[1:18:42] David was waiting even when he did not
[1:18:45] know you were in a better place than
[1:18:48] David tonight because I have told you
[1:18:54] David no one told him
[1:18:57] David was just waiting but here I'm
[1:19:00] telling you
[1:19:01] wait
[1:19:05] ing
[1:19:06] something is fixing to happen
[1:19:09] wait upon the Lord
[1:19:14] and then came a time when a time of
[1:19:19] waiting was almost over um
[1:19:25] three chapters later
[1:19:28] in 1612.
[1:19:32] and he sent and brought him in now he
[1:19:35] was Rudy and Widow of a beautiful
[1:19:37] continents and goodly to look too and
[1:19:40] the Lord said arise
[1:19:42] anoint him for this is he then someone
[1:19:45] took the Horn of all and anointed him in
[1:19:47] the midst of his Brethren and the spirit
[1:19:49] of the Lord Came Upon David
[1:19:51] from that day forward so someone rose up
[1:19:54] and went to ramam but the spirit of the
[1:19:56] Lord departed from Saul and an evil
[1:19:58] spirit from the Lord troubled him and
[1:20:01] sold servants said unto him behold now
[1:20:03] an evil spirit from God troubling I want
[1:20:05] you to see something here
[1:20:08] at this time of course we know the story
[1:20:11] how someone went to Jesse's house
[1:20:15] and when he arrived in Jesus house
[1:20:19] he was supposed to anoint a king there
[1:20:21] yeah
[1:20:23] I want to ask you another question
[1:20:25] did he know who the king was
[1:20:30] isn't this the same man that spoke to
[1:20:33] Saul and he said God has chosen another
[1:20:35] man
[1:20:40] so did he know the man
[1:20:42] he was making my inspiration
[1:20:46] that's why you should always be careful
[1:20:48] when the word of God goes through the
[1:20:51] the minister because sometimes God is
[1:20:53] designing speaking your heart without
[1:20:55] even the man himself knowing what he's
[1:20:56] talking about
[1:21:03] um
[1:21:06] a few statements it's about your life
[1:21:09] you know it's about your life but I
[1:21:10] don't know anything about even what I'm
[1:21:12] saying this is
[1:21:17] so yeah Saul was telling King uh someone
[1:21:21] was telling King Saul
[1:21:23] that God has the kingdom will no longer
[1:21:26] continue with you
[1:21:28] God has chosen himself
[1:21:31] but even so did not know
[1:21:43] and go in the house
[1:21:46] how
[1:21:57] he he followed the leadership of God
[1:22:00] he took him there
[1:22:03] what did he have to do friends
[1:22:09] but like many of us
[1:22:13] sometimes waiting is a menace
[1:22:16] foreign
[1:22:51] [Music]
[1:23:02] foreign
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:31] foreign
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:49] then again he saw another one
[1:23:51] because
[1:24:08] to me
[1:24:10] who are those little preachers for
[1:24:11] tomorrow
[1:24:13] send them over here
[1:24:15] all right come come laying up here how
[1:24:18] many times did he just have yes
[1:24:22] huh
[1:24:24] by the time will come come on
[1:24:29] and fill the whole place
[1:24:32] just as children
[1:24:35] you see how all of them how good they
[1:24:38] are told
[1:24:45] us
[1:24:54] went to the next one
[1:24:58] can you imagine she didn't wait
[1:25:01] and then all of a sudden
[1:25:03] God had somebody there
[1:25:09] praise the name of the Lord
[1:25:11] God had somebody
[1:25:13] that he had kept somewhere
[1:25:16] we are nobody knew
[1:25:21] look at that
[1:25:24] foreign
[1:26:00] good man please let's go choose from
[1:26:03] dogs
[1:26:04] I'm not saying God has not chosen you
[1:26:10] so then then but God goes
[1:26:15] no shoes
[1:26:28] I'm imagining David is a he must have
[1:26:32] looked at him like this is
[1:26:37] foreign
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:23] ah
[1:27:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:33] God is saying this is
[1:27:43] God is telling me there is someone there
[1:27:51] foreign
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:28:10] then he collects himself
[1:28:18] is the one that has been having
[1:28:21] headaches
[1:28:23] two of them said yeah

[1:29:15] here
[1:29:23] David
[1:29:25] God chose him and when God chose him I
[1:29:30] will not read Because of time God
[1:29:31] anointed him after and the moment God
[1:29:35] anointed him
[1:29:36] the Bible says the spirit of God
[1:29:41] David
[1:29:43] and the spirit of God
[1:29:47] and an evil spirit
[1:29:52] how I don't know but that's what the
[1:29:54] Bible says
[1:29:59] Saul was a troubled soul
[1:30:05] but that was for a purpose
[1:30:09] there are certain things that God
[1:30:11] permits to happen
[1:30:14] so that his purpose can be accomplished
[1:30:18] in some people's lives
[1:30:25] told her to have this evil spirit
[1:30:28] movie so that David can become relevant
[1:30:33] Hallelujah I mean and when David was
[1:30:36] anointed
[1:30:37] he still was like a number
[1:30:43] the evil spirit came to sorrow
[1:30:46] and then there was a need for somebody
[1:30:50] who had the spirit
[1:30:53] now the Bible says the spirit of the
[1:30:57] evil spirit
[1:30:58] um
[1:31:06] with all that bad attitude
[1:31:09] that's why I always tell people
[1:31:12] sometimes the people who have bad
[1:31:13] attitudes
[1:31:20] [Music]
[1:31:25] foreign
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:32:09] the evil spirited Souls
[1:32:12] called for the spirit of God in David
[1:32:17] that was not a coincidence
[1:32:20] some people are tormented in this Earth
[1:32:25] so that it can call for what is in you
[1:32:30] to give them a solution
[1:32:34] hallelujah amen let me tell you whenever
[1:32:38] I work in this world
[1:32:39] I don't know I don't believe it is a
[1:32:42] condition I believe it is how it is
[1:32:43] supposed to be secret is
[1:32:45] I always see myself as a little David
[1:32:49] you should see yourself as a little
[1:32:51] David
[1:32:52] where is
[1:32:55] I can cast it out how are you going to
[1:32:58] cast it out by the spirit of God that is
[1:33:02] in you

[1:36:47] the anointing was wrong I wonder which

[1:41:52] he reached the king he told the kingdom

[1:41:58] he said okay
[1:42:00] let me give you my jacket
[1:42:04] so that you can go okay

[1:42:28] with only one thing Jesus yes only one
[1:42:32] thing the revealed one of the earth
[1:42:38] and when he went again he killed that
[1:42:41] man but let me tell you one thing I
[1:42:44] didn't tell you
[1:42:46] David said
[1:42:50] they asked the question the first
[1:42:51] question the very first question they
[1:42:52] asked
[1:42:55] the man who will kill this guy um
[1:43:04] and they told him
[1:43:07] he's going to give him
[1:43:09] one of his daughters
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:16] what was the name of Jesus daughter
[1:43:21] foreign
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:19] and at that moment because he killed
[1:44:22] that man without hesitation
[1:44:26] another battle started in the palace
[1:44:31] this boy was becoming very popular
[1:44:38] and the King now knew he was a threat to
[1:44:41] his kingdom
[1:44:43] but David waited
[1:44:49] throughout the whole time David waited
[1:45:22] he was one
[1:45:40] he was so tempted
[1:45:43] he cut some piece of his clothes
[1:45:47] because the soul was not seeing somebody
[1:45:51] but David would have just said
[1:45:53] God you know I'm anointed
[1:45:57] foreign
[1:46:30] and one of the boys of David
[1:46:33] um
[1:46:33] quickly ran and brought the the the the
[1:46:37] crown yeah
[1:46:43] David was not happy with that boy
[1:46:49] I think I don't remember I think he
[1:46:51] killed him
[1:46:54] because he told him he said how can you
[1:46:56] speak how can you rejoice over the death
[1:46:59] of God is Anointed
[1:47:04] even that
[1:47:06] it's really to be um to be around some a
[1:47:10] man or a woman of God who is waiting
[1:47:14] to be around such people
[1:47:17] you have to be very careful
[1:47:20] you can lose your life
[1:47:43] you will not be blessed
[1:47:47] took David nearly 15 years

[1:49:00] instrumentality to it
[1:49:05] here you pull that you push here
[1:49:10] let God do things

[1:49:22] small for him to sit on that throne
[1:49:24] foreign
[1:49:32] God did everything
[1:49:35] God literally dragged him on that Throne

[1:50:27] and walking into the dogs
[1:50:30] and walking into the door that God has
[1:50:32] always
[1:50:41] did not push any door open

[1:51:24] and then finally the message was
[1:51:26] projector light
