[35:20] services today.
[35:24] Today just this moment is just the
[35:26] beginning
[35:29] of a wonderful day and we are here.
[35:33] Usually we thought we just maybe come
[35:35] and you know hear something from a
[35:38] minister something little and maybe we
[35:39] also pray for the day and
[35:46] uh but uh this morning
[35:49] we have I have something special for you
[35:55] &gt;&gt; you know. Amen.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Brother that came came just flown in a
[36:00] few days ago.
[36:06] uh from Ethiopia.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; I just felt that I should we should try
[36:10] to kind of um have him come because
[36:14] um you know for him also to have a
[36:16] wonderful time.
[36:23] Maybe you want to sit for just a few
[36:25] moments
[36:28] &gt;&gt; uh for him to just uh come and enjoy
[36:30] fellowship with us.
[36:34] and uh then go back and be a blessing to
[36:37] his people.
[36:40] But was one of the first believers in
[36:43] Ethiopia
[36:47] I think yesterday I alluded to that when
[36:49] I was speaking a little testimony.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Um my wife and I you know went to
[36:58] Ethiopia for our honeymoon in 2013.
[37:04] And on that honeymoon,
[37:07] one sister believed the message.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; So we did not plan it that way.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; So I'm not trying to tell you that I'm a
[37:16] very spiritual man that people believed
[37:17] on my honeymoon.
[37:22] What I'm saying is that we were there
[37:24] when God did it.
[37:28] And this sister
[37:30] her name is Sister Yordit
[37:34] &gt;&gt; and she happened now to be the very
[37:36] first believer
[37:41] in the country of Ethiopia
[37:44] as far as the work that God sent us to
[37:46] do there is concerned.
[37:50] A few others believed
[37:53] and you know through her and brother
[37:56] Asid is one of them.
[37:59] Amen. She got an invit he she gave him
[38:02] an invitation to come.
[38:05] She gave him an invitation to come.
[38:09] Uh she gave him an invitation to come.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Don't think are you the one interpreting
[38:16] for the minister?
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. take yourself out of the way,
[38:20] &gt;&gt; okay?
[38:20] &gt;&gt; And say what the preacher is saying. I
[38:23] know you're a good interpreter,
[38:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Let's take yourself out of the way.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; So, um, he she invited him to come
[38:31] and, um, you know, he received the
[38:33] message there after he was a lecturer in
[38:35] one of the un several universities
[38:40] and I remember one time, you know,
[38:41] sitted in my office.
[38:44] I told him brother
[38:48] I told him
[38:51] God can give you a university
[38:54] &gt;&gt; a college of your own
[38:57] and you know the Ethiopians are very uh
[39:00] the people who grab the blessing
[39:05] he shouted amen
[39:08] amen and then just a few months after
[39:10] that
[39:12] he asked me to name the college
[39:16] and which means God gave it to him
[39:20] and uh and uh we named it Bridge College
[39:29] and and so God has been God has blessed
[39:31] him
[39:33] and together with him maybe some of you
[39:35] have even seen those videos when he was
[39:37] interpreting
[39:40] and we've reached out to many places
[39:44] And uh God has brought in many souls.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; So brother is an evangel evangelism
[39:53] machine.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; He has a burden for souls.
[39:59] Shall we receive him this morning
[40:03] tell us his testimony and whatever
[40:07] whatever more he wants to do. We have a
[40:09] short time but I know it will be an
[40:12] inspiration to the young people.

[42:11] I have so many things to say
[42:14] &gt;&gt; but uh because of the time shortage
[42:18] we have to use it effectively
[42:21] now
[42:23] uh directly. I would love to pass into
[42:25] the testimonies that I have bring.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. While the media team is preparing
[42:33] the PowerPoint, maybe
[42:37] to share you what the Lord has done
[42:42] in the country of Ethiopia.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; You see,
[42:49] &gt;&gt; you are not an Ugandian. You are not
[42:52] Kenyan. I am not Ethiopian.
[42:55] We have one citizenship that is heavenly
[42:59] citizenship. Praise be the name of Jesus
[43:02] Christ.
[43:04] But when the Lord
[43:06] bring us to this planet earth,
[43:10] he make us some of some of us to be
[43:12] Ethiopian, some of us to be Kenyan, some
[43:16] of us to be Ugandian, some of us to be
[43:18] Chinese
[43:21] from each and every nations and
[43:23] nationalities.
[43:25] The Lord has his own bride of Christ.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; So we shall see soon together with the
[43:34] bridegroom. Hallelujah.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Until then, we have to share what the
[43:40] Lord has been doing in our life.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; There is a scripture that says in the
[43:47] Bible,
[43:50] there are two major tools that you can
[43:53] overcome the devil.
[43:56] testimony. You are GOING TO DESTROY THE
[44:00] HEAD of the serpent.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; And also by the revealed word of God.
[44:10] That revealed word of God has come into
[44:13] our own way. We didn't come into the
[44:16] message, but the message come to our own
[44:18] way.
[44:20] HALLELUJAH. YOU NEVER ASK IT TO COME. I
[44:23] NEVER ASK IT TO COME. BUT HE HIMSELF
[44:26] bring it to my own way.

[44:48] You must tell for others. You must
[44:52] you don't have to sit in your house. You
[44:55] don't have to sit in your church.
[44:58] Go and search for the souls.
[45:01] Amen. Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; God will do something special.
[45:06] So you know uh back years uh in Ethiopia
[45:10] you know
[45:12] how I I I wonder how God has been using
[45:15] different pupils, different ministers.
[45:20] for for the message to come to Ethiopia.
[45:24] I cannot finish it. I cannot completely
[45:29] finish everything what the Lord has done
[45:32] in Ethiopia but
[45:34] in respecting
[45:36] in respecting of my life
[45:39] in connection with my life in relation
[45:42] with my life.
[45:44] I'm going to share you the testimonies
[45:46] what the Lord has given.
[45:50] So as pastor has been telling you
[45:56] can you just uh slide one more this is
[46:00] just the yeah now this is our situation
[46:03] now now
[46:05] I put it uh a word it says before the
[46:09] beginning
[46:12] you know brotherham says
[46:16] even this day not that day even this
[46:20] it has been already in the mind of God
[46:24] before even the foundations of this
[46:26] world while he was in the form of the
[46:29] logos.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So before everything begins before
[46:36] the beginning
[46:38] saw this congregation
[46:41] this is the congregation that I'm
[46:42] leading that I'm ministering right now.
[46:46] Praise be the name of Jesus Christ.
[46:48] So now let us go to the beginning.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How it begins.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Can you? Yes. So in the beginning what
[46:59] just happened?
[47:01] &gt;&gt; You know in the beginning I uh was
[47:05] married
[47:07] before I come to this message
[47:10] and uh there was a sister her name is
[47:12] sister Yodit.
[47:15] She was like you know a Samaritan woman
[47:18] for me.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; She just bring the message. She was the
[47:24] first touch or the first person who told
[47:27] me about the message.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh I'm going to show you who she
[47:33] sister Yod is. But before
[47:36] this picture that you are seeing,
[47:40] can you find out pastor Talima and his
[47:42] wife
[47:44] and also his two daughters? You are
[47:47] seeing it. Yes. On the first picture
[47:50] they have invested their time.
[47:53] I have to appreciate that. I I have to
[47:56] respect that.
[47:59] Please clap your hands for pastoral.
[48:03] It was not easy
[48:06] &gt;&gt; for them
[48:07] you know their intention was to come and
[48:10] to enjoy their honeymoon.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; The Lord has his own plan beyond beyond
[48:17] the honeymoon.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; The Lord used pastor Talma to
[48:33] for 5 years. Hallelujah.
[48:35] And I have been able to really get the
[48:38] message really to see the message. So uh
[48:42] this is where I just bring him to uh my
[48:47] house. Then after the dedication of my
[48:50] baby. This is my first baby.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So my first baby born he he was
[48:57] just dedicated in the church where
[49:00] where pastor was leading us.
[49:04] So I then in the next slide you will see
[49:08] I I I I I invited them to come to my
[49:11] house.
[49:14] Yeah. Amen. But before that so this is
[49:17] sister Yodit
[49:19] that introduced this message to me.
[49:22] For your surprise, we met with
[49:41] he was
[49:46] I received the message
[49:51] until now. He is rejecting the message.
[49:54] I thank God for that for that friend
[49:57] because he bring her this sister in my
[50:00] way. Hallelujah.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; So I just really grabbed it. Hallelujah.
[50:06] So in the next slide that you see uh I
[50:09] just bro I just invited pastor Talma and
[50:13] brother Germa. Brother GMA is now
[50:17] the husband for sister Yodit.
[50:21] Now this time they are preaching the
[50:24] message
[50:26] in my house where I have been preparing
[50:29] a little ceremony
[50:32] because of the birthday ceremony for my
[50:35] first baby.
[50:37] After the invitation from the church
[50:39] program then they come back to my house.
[50:44] What was the reason behind?
[50:46] &gt;&gt; I have told every uh person that I know,
[50:51] all the relatives that I know,
[50:54] you must come and listen to what the
[50:57] message is saying about
[51:01] me. I didn't have that much knowledge
[51:03] about the message,
[51:06] but I have already totally received it.
[51:10] I'm convinced that you know some of the
[51:14] things in the message will be revealed
[51:16] through time
[51:19] but whether it is reveal you have got
[51:22] the full uh the full you know meaning
[51:25] interpretation or not.
[51:28] You must keep.
[51:30] You must just keep believing
[51:33] and be a testimony wherever you go in
[51:36] your place of God, in your house, in
[51:39] your neighborhood, wherever you go.
[51:42] That was the first step that I have done
[51:49] of the hour at my place.
[52:25] I hope
[52:42] they're not ministering. I'm now leading
[52:45] a church back home in Ethiopia.
[52:48] Hallelujah.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; So even pastor Mo he has got married and
[52:52] now he's now a pastor in back in home in
[52:57] even recently I I hope those people who
[53:00] come from start Exodus church from
[53:03] pastor week church they the saints from
[53:06] the believers from Ethiopia have been
[53:08] traveling and seeing there. Yeah.
[53:12] So this is the way the work of God is uh
[53:15] how the work of God is doing.
[53:16] Hallelujah.
[53:19] So in the next slide there was uh an
[53:23] amazing movement of the message
[53:27] in you know this is howasa mission in
[53:31] 2019
[53:36] you know 2019 it was time.
[53:40] You know what I what I always be amazed
[53:42] by the work of God.
[53:45] It was a time of chaos. You know,
[53:50] &gt;&gt; but you know for the first time
[53:54] before 2019 many ministers have gone to
[53:57] Hawasa to preach this message.
[54:02] What makes it special in 2019?
[54:06] Pastor Tal he told me I have got this
[54:09] vision
[54:12] this year I am coming with brother Kane
[54:15] you know you have seen brother K from
[54:17] Nairobi church brother K the one who has
[54:20] been preaching yesterday
[54:23] we are we are coming to Ethiopia
[54:26] we I have got a big burden
[54:30] to outreach this message in uh city
[54:34] called Hawasa
[54:37] It's not his first time when he has king
[54:39] coming. Many people many has been
[54:42] preaching.
[54:44] What makes it special in 2018
[54:46] when they come in before we go to
[54:52] we were having a prayer.
[54:55] I remember it was I think in at brother
[54:58] Gay's house. Yeah.
[55:01] We were just like this holding each
[55:03] other hands each other and we have been
[55:05] praying.
[55:08] You know what just happened
[55:12] while we are praying
[55:14] just a voice come to me.
[55:17] The Lord spoke to me
[55:19] and I was in that you know in that
[55:23] condition of in that presence.
[55:26] I remember I prophesy once
[55:30] I said in this year in this mission this
[55:36] mission will be different
[55:39] it was recorded I believe.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what what what the Lord was
[55:44] speaking
[55:46] in this mission a church will be
[55:48] established in our
[55:51] that was the voice that I have heard
[55:56] it's kind of difficult for you even to
[55:58] to to speak about planting a church
[56:01] brother
[56:05] but the Lord was faithful
[56:08] just we go there inasa
[56:11] For I think about two weeks you have
[56:14] been preaching a message. Remember it
[56:16] was time.
[56:18] It was everybody you know everyone has.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; IT WAS TERRIBLE TIME.
[56:27] God helped us. He just supported us. I
[56:31] have never seen a move of God
[56:34] like that time
[56:36] just within short period of days or
[56:39] time.
[56:41] about 35 pupils have got baptized in the
[56:44] name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[56:47] ALMOST MORE THAN 35 PUPILS. Out of the
[56:51] 35
[56:53] individuals who have been baptized,
[56:56] THERE WERE ABOUT SEVEN FAMILIES,
[57:01] seven families and other individuals.
[57:05] Now what just happened?
[57:09] Those believers have been having
[57:11] fellowship
[57:12] in one of the brother's house
[57:16] and that brother has been living in
[57:18] Hawasa. He has been I mean his name was
[57:22] brother Tim. Brother Tim he cames from
[57:25] Nairobi
[57:27] Kenya but he was living in Hawasa. He
[57:31] has been working in Hawasa Industrial
[57:33] Park.
[57:34] He was a chemical engineer.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; He was dedicating himself, his life, his
[57:40] house, even his uh wife, they have been
[57:43] dedicated.
[57:46] So we were having fellowship. The
[57:48] believers have been fellowship in his
[57:50] house.
[57:52] Now because of the flow of the believers
[57:57] cannot hold the believers, it becomes
[57:59] TOO MUCH.
[58:01] WE didn't ask the believers
[58:04] But sometimes THEY SAY
[58:06] &gt;&gt; NOW WE NEED A CHURCH.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; We need TO HAVE A CHURCH. WE NEED TO
[58:12] RENT A CHURCH.
[58:15] They asking us
[58:18] then what can I say about how the Lord
[58:21] has been intervening his life his way.
[58:24] Hallelujah.
[58:27] I believe also God give him uh you know
[58:30] some you know uh
[58:33] some pupils for pastor Talma and he has
[58:36] been uh trying to manage
[58:39] to to bring those finances to support
[58:42] then one way or another
[58:44] God prepared all the financial
[58:46] provisions
[58:48] the church in Aasa has been established
[58:52] praise be the name of Jesus Christ.
[58:53] Amen.
[58:55] Now in the next slide.
[58:59] Yeah. Oh, I think this thing has been
[59:02] changing in another. Can you read it?
[59:05] No. No. This another language. I don't
[59:06] know how it changed into another
[59:08] language. But let me tell you something
[59:11] about Ethiopia.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know when it is converted into
[59:16] PowerPoint file. I think that's why. But
[59:18] let me tell you, I have it in my uh
[59:21] smartphone. So about Ethiopia you have
[59:24] to know something
[59:27] in Ethiopia
[59:29] &gt;&gt; do you know that we are about 135
[59:32] million population
[59:36] it means almost three times Uganda
[59:43] now what why am I saying this
[59:46] in Uganda
[59:48] &gt;&gt; or when you go to Kenya
[59:50] &gt;&gt; or Zimbabwe or any other African
[59:53] countries.
[59:55] There are a number of message believers
[59:58] and there are number of churches.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; what about for us?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; We have to WORK VERY HARD. WE have to
[1:00:08] preach THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:00:12] THIS BURDEN IS NOT ONLY FOR US. YOU HAVE
[1:00:16] TO share this burden. That's why I'm
[1:00:18] bringing this message. That's why I'm
[1:00:20] bringing this testimony.
[1:00:22] THERE IS A LOT OF WORK to do in
[1:00:24] Ethiopia.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, of course. God has already started
[1:00:29] to raise to raise us, different,
[1:00:33] different ministers.
[1:00:36] You need to pray for Ethiopia,
[1:00:41] you know, comparing with the total
[1:00:43] population.
[1:00:45] Me, I have studied accounting and
[1:00:47] finance. my first degree international I
[1:00:50] also uh so let me show you something
[1:00:54] from the message you know brother Branam
[1:00:56] he said at least one in a million you
[1:00:58] know that message
[1:01:00] even if you come to the calculation of
[1:01:02] of one in a million
[1:01:07] how many thousands of believers must
[1:01:10] come out from 135 million population
[1:01:16] take
[1:01:21] still we have we have so many works to
[1:01:23] do.
[1:01:25] We have outreach to do
[1:01:29] for Ethiopia.
[1:01:32] We must go. We must support one way or
[1:01:35] another. We have to pray.
[1:01:39] We have about 12 regions. We have about
[1:01:42] two chartered cities.
[1:01:46] If you go and even if if you go in one
[1:01:48] region, one region might have about 4.9
[1:01:52] million population
[1:01:56] is about 4 million in one region.
[1:02:00] The population is too much
[1:02:02] is good.
[1:02:04] So we have to be able to outreach.
[1:02:09] Do you agree for that?
[1:02:11] Do you agree for that?
[1:02:13] Are you happy?
[1:02:16] So what we are going to do
[1:02:20] just the last slide
[1:02:22] I think the Yeah. Let us claim for the
[1:02:25] message of the hour.
[1:02:29] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:02:32] There is something that I have bring.
[1:02:37] I am a man of faith.
[1:02:40] You don't have to have faith.
[1:02:43] I will have faith for you. Don't worry.
[1:02:47] I am a man of faith.
[1:02:50] I know you are a man of faith also.
[1:02:53] In this building, every one of you are a
[1:02:56] man of faith.
[1:03:00] So I just bring by faith
[1:03:06] just to be a sign.
[1:03:11] You know in uh Branam's tabernacle when
[1:03:13] he was you know uh he when he was uh
[1:03:18] ministering
[1:03:21] sometimes he told them to bring
[1:03:23] handkerchiefs
[1:03:27] to be as a sign then they will pray over
[1:03:29] on that handkerchief.
[1:03:32] People who have faith and use that will
[1:03:36] get healed whether they have cancer or
[1:03:39] any kind of diseases.
[1:03:42] So it's biblical
[1:03:45] I was thinking I was meditating
[1:03:49] what should I bring as a sign just like
[1:03:56] if there is a one or two deacons that
[1:03:57] can bring me that uh uh
[1:04:04] I have bring the Ethiopian flag.
[1:04:09] If you can help me the deacons,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; I would love to give this
[1:04:16] Ethiopian flag just as a sign
[1:04:20] just to pray over it.
[1:04:23] Let them give you for each and everyone.
[1:04:28] Yeah. It may not be enough, but at least
[1:04:31] it gives them.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; We are going to pray by faith to this
[1:04:40] country, ETHIOPIA.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Our citizenship is heavenly. As I told
[1:04:51] you,
[1:04:53] this is just where we came from. Yes,
[1:04:56] for this flesh
[1:04:59] we have another theophony body
[1:05:02] that comes from above and that we go
[1:05:05] return back to above.
[1:05:09] But while we are on this planet earth
[1:05:12] me I have come from the country of
[1:05:14] that's called Ethiopia.
[1:05:17] We must pray for this country.
[1:05:21] Once you have got on your hand,
[1:05:25] it means you have a responsibility.
[1:05:29] You are sharing a burden
[1:05:33] when you go back to your home.
[1:05:36] You will pray for Ethiopia.
[1:05:40] You will support Ethiopia.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Don't you love Ethiopia?
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Please clap your hands for Ethiopia
[1:05:47] believers who are standing for the
[1:05:48] message of our high.
[1:05:53] It is not easy task. I know
[1:05:57] maybe if you come around here in Uganda
[1:05:59] or in Kenya, it will be much easy for
[1:06:01] us. But
[1:06:04] now this is a time for us to fight with
[1:06:07] the devil
[1:06:10] and to to BRING ALL THE SOULS THAT HAVE
[1:06:13] BEEN predestinated for this pure message
[1:06:15] of the hour.
[1:06:20] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; So by faith
[1:06:25] let us pray. I would love pastor Talma
[1:06:28] to pray over it.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; If you are able to stand on your on your
[1:06:33] feet
[1:06:37] let us bring Ethiopia onto the hand of
[1:06:39] the Lord.
[1:06:44] I don't know whether you understood the
[1:06:45] purpose of pray of the prayer.
[1:06:50] over 135 million people in Ethiopia.
[1:06:56] I don't know how many maybe a few
[1:06:58] believers.
[1:07:01] So his burden is
[1:07:03] he wants God
[1:07:06] to help the message to penetrate in the
[1:07:09] hearts of the Ethiopians
[1:07:14] you know so so that they can Ethiopia
[1:07:17] can receive this message
[1:07:19] he's a witness and he has a burden for
[1:07:22] his country.
[1:07:24] I never knew he was going to do this,
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; but I think it's it's worth our prayer.
[1:07:31] I said if you have a flag of Ethiopia,
[1:07:34] it is a responsibility
[1:07:36] because you're going to remain with that
[1:07:37] flag. Whenever you have it, you pray for
[1:07:39] Ethiopia,
[1:07:42] let us pray.

[1:07:46] author of life,

[1:07:52] You design the hearts of men.
[1:07:56] God, we never planned, but you knew this

[1:08:00] we would be in this place with our
[1:08:02] precious brother
[1:08:05] from Ethiopia.
[1:08:07] Lord, I know like him there are a few
[1:08:09] that have received the message in the
[1:08:11] country,
[1:08:15] Lord. And there are also those that are
[1:08:17] trying like him to reach out into the
[1:08:19] country.
[1:08:24] But Lord, I know that you will honor our
[1:08:25] brother's faith.
[1:08:28] You even take the trouble to bring us
[1:08:30] these flags

[1:15:10] Exodus
[1:15:12] is an amazing uh chapter
[1:15:16] as we have seen it now from verse 12.
[1:15:21] This is just a beginning of Exodus, a
[1:15:25] beginning of going out.
[1:15:29] You know, brother Abraham said in around
[1:15:31] paragraph 8, he said, "And now it's a

[1:16:05] But God is going to do something
[1:16:07] special.
[1:16:10] He is about to execute judgment.
[1:16:14] But that judgment
[1:16:16] does not attack the righteous
[1:16:19] generation.
[1:16:22] A judgment IS COMING EVEN IN THIS
[1:16:24] GENERATION.
[1:16:26] But only the righteous generation has
[1:16:29] the right to PASS
[1:16:32] BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A SIGN. THEY DO
[1:16:35] HAVE A TOKEN. THAT TOKEN IS CALLED THE
[1:16:38] BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. THE WHERE IS THE

[1:25:51] Let me give you one testimony.
[1:25:54] While I was coming
[1:25:56] in Ethiopian airplane, I was in a plane
[1:26:00] and uh where I just seated in the right
[1:26:03] side.
[1:26:05] So before the plane starts fly

[1:26:48] before
[1:26:51] and he said this
[1:26:53] he said me I'm a prophet he said about
[1:26:56] himself
[1:26:58] from the denomination
[1:27:00] and he told me
[1:27:02] I am seeing an angel beside you.
[1:27:07] He said, "I'M SEEING AN ANGEL BESIDE
[1:27:09] YOU. I DON'T KNOW YOU.
[1:27:12] IF YOU are a minister, a pastor,
[1:27:15] CAN YOU TELL YOU ARE A MINISTER of the
[1:27:18] message of the hour?"
[1:27:23] Hallelujah. Amen. I AM AN AMBASSADOR OF
[1:27:25] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:27:28] AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE DONE? I TOLD
[1:27:32] HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END WHILE I'M
[1:27:34] COMING FROM
[1:27:38] AND I SHOWED HIM THIS BOOKLET
[1:27:41] and you know what he did. OH PLEASE I

[1:27:57] AMEN.
[1:27:59] Maybe he want to use it for healing and
[1:28:01] deliverance. I DON'T CARE.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE is another ANOINTING FOR US, A
[1:28:06] DIFFERENT
[1:28:11] WE ARE BEYOND HEALING AND DELIVERANCE
[1:28:14] SERVICE.
[1:28:18] HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:20] OUR JOURNEY
[1:28:23] SHOULD BE THE MESSAGE ITSELF.
[1:28:27] I AM THE MESSAGE WALKING ON PLANET
[1:28:29] EARTH. I AM THE MESSAGE WALKING IN
[1:28:32] ETHIOPIA. I AM THE MESSAGE WALKING IN MY
[1:28:35] BUSINESS PLACE. I AM THE MESSAGE WALKING
[1:28:37] IN MY FAMILY IN MY NEIGHBORS.

[1:28:57] You see the way of God is different
[1:29:01] than we think. Hallelujah.
[1:29:06] You know in the message called
[1:29:07] identification.
[1:29:10] The prophet told us
[1:29:14] if you are in the lamp's book of life
[1:29:19] because that lamp
[1:29:21] already
[1:29:24] A sufficient sacrifice has been made
[1:29:26] already.
[1:29:28] An accepted sacrifice HAS BEEN MADE
[1:29:30] ALREADY.
[1:29:32] SO IN THE MESSAGE CALLED IDENTIFICATION,
[1:29:34] THE PROPHET TOLD US IF YOU are in THE
[1:29:38] LAMP'S BOOK OF LIFE, I BELIEVE ALL OF US
[1:29:42] are written in the lamp book of life.
[1:29:46] IS THERE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN
[1:29:48] THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE IN THIS
[1:29:49] CONGREGATION TODAY?
[1:29:53] BECAUSE YOU ARE ELECTED BEFORE THE
[1:29:54] FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD. Because you
[1:29:56] are chosen before the FOUNDATIONS OF
[1:29:58] THIS WORLD. HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE,
[1:30:05] YOU ARE HIS THOUGHT MADE WORD.
[1:30:09] HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:11] YOU ARE HIS THOUGHT MADE WHAT? WORD.
[1:30:15] AND EXPRESSED IN WHAT YOU ARE NOW.
[1:30:20] YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE LIKE BROTHER K.

[1:30:26] TO BE LIKE
[1:30:28] ME
[1:30:30] JUST IN OUR OWN WAY. WE ARE MANIFESTED.
[1:30:34] WE ARE AN EXPRESS
[1:30:37] HIMSELF.
[1:30:39] HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:41] AMEN. YES SIR. YES SIR.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE
[1:30:46] MADE
[1:30:49] BUT YOU ARE NOW.
[1:30:53] THAT IS GOD IN you
[1:30:56] reflecting Christ today
[1:31:00] IN THIS LAST CHURCH AGE
[1:31:04] OF
[1:31:06] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; One way or another we are
[1:31:11] INTO THAT INTO THAT.
[1:31:16] Yes sir. Praise be THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:31:18] CHRIST. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; You see most of the denominations tries
[1:31:28] to make him meet under our under their
[1:31:31] theology
[1:31:33] under the DENOMINATION
[1:31:37] educational programs.
[1:31:40] But God only
[1:31:42] meets the true worshiper
[1:31:45] and under the BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:31:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; We are very lucky.
[1:31:55] So God needs
[1:31:58] God always you know follows the same
[1:32:00] standard same principle
[1:32:03] what was in Genesis shall continue
[1:32:08] without shedding of the blood
[1:32:11] of sin.
[1:32:13] What the Bible says without shedding of
[1:32:16] the blood there is no remission of sin.
[1:32:22] By an eagle eye the prophet comes in our
[1:32:25] age and told us
[1:32:27] while we are you know arguing about
[1:32:31] is
[1:32:35] he told us sin is not just making
[1:32:37] ADULTERY
[1:32:40] lying
[1:32:42] just you know having FIGHTING EACH OTHER
[1:32:46] THESE ALL BAD THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING.
[1:32:48] NO NO NO NO NO. THESE THINGS ARE THE
[1:32:51] BYPRODUCTS OF SIN
[1:32:54] OF SIN.
[1:32:56] THE REAL SIN
[1:32:58] AND BELIEVE BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR
[1:33:01] BY THE MESSAGE OF YOUR AGE BY THE WORD
[1:33:04] OF GOD WHEN YOU ARE DEDUCTING FROM THE
[1:33:08] SCRIPTURE YOU are sinning.
[1:33:14] SO THAT SIN NEEDS WHAT? A sacrifications
[1:33:17] of blood.
[1:33:21] No one was worthy
[1:33:25] BRING US BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL SITUATION
[1:33:29] EXCEPT JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF.
[1:33:32] GOD MAKE HIMSELF HUMAN FLESH.
[1:33:36] HE COMES IN A HUMAN MADE FLESH
[1:33:41] in fullness
[1:33:44] just for FOR US TO RECONCILE BACK TO
[1:33:47] HIM.
[1:33:49] THE BIBLE TOLD US RECONCILE himself to
[1:33:52] us.
[1:33:55] He reconciled us to himself.
[1:33:59] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; WE ARE PURCHASED BY WE ARE NOT PURCHASED
[1:34:03] BY A GOLD. WE ARE NOT PURCHASED BY A
[1:34:06] PRECIOUS THING. WE ARE NOT PURCHASED BY
[1:34:09] ETHIOPIAN. WE ARE NOT PURCHASED BY
[1:34:12] AMERICAN DOLLAR. WE ARE NOT PURCHASED BY
[1:34:14] UGANDA. WE ARE NOT PURCHASED BY KENYAN
[1:34:17] SHILLING. BUT WE ALL OF US ARE PURCHASED
[1:34:21] BY THE PRECIOUS BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:34:24] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Let us pray the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:34:28] GOD BLESS YOU. I LOVE YOU.
[1:34:32] AMEN.
[1:34:36] AMEN.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:50] Let's give another clap of
[1:34:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:35:02] Uh, can I can I have that book? Brother,
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; see friends,
[1:35:13] this man that just spoke to you
[1:35:17] when he received the message,
[1:35:20] he never slept off with it.
[1:35:23] He went to work.
[1:35:27] You see this church age book?
[1:35:31] He translated it.
[1:35:37] If you look at the characters, I don't
[1:35:39] know if the camera can see this for
[1:35:41] those who are on,
[1:35:43] but if you look at the characters,
[1:35:45] you think it's a chicken
[1:35:49] trying to scrub a few words.
[1:35:52] You can make nothing out of it.
[1:35:55] But the message came in English.
[1:35:58] But these people in Ethiopia also
[1:35:59] deserve to hear the message in their own
[1:36:01] language.
[1:36:04] And brother without even knowing brother
[1:36:10] prophesy
[1:36:11] that this message will go to every
[1:36:15] nation
[1:36:17] and will be translated in many languages
[1:36:20] all over the world.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I believe Maharik was one of them.
[1:36:28] So this day
[1:36:31] these prophecies fulfilled.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed to identify himself
[1:36:42] with a pillar of fire.
[1:36:45] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; And he just shared a few pictures there.
[1:36:50] One of them brother testify the pastor
[1:36:52] now in one of the pastors in Aasa.
[1:36:59] was a pastor in the Pentecostal church
[1:37:03] and uh this man was very very stubbornly
[1:37:07] rigid in his own ideas
[1:37:15] because he loved the Lord too much.
[1:37:18] He never wanted to be deceived. So you
[1:37:20] thought what we are teaching is
[1:37:21] deception.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; But because brother Aset had translated
[1:37:25] a message in in in some of these tracks,
[1:37:31] they happened to be one of a little
[1:37:33] young sister
[1:37:36] living in brother Tim's house. Brother
[1:37:38] Tim who happens to be a Kenyan. There's
[1:37:39] a connection and Kenya.
[1:37:47] This sister's name is called Rebecca or
[1:37:48] Eurob or whatever you want to call it.
[1:37:51] And she picked that little tract. You
[1:37:53] see, we always told them, "Don't sleep.
[1:37:58] Take a tract. Give to tell someone about
[1:38:01] the message. This is what every one of
[1:38:04] us must do after THIS YOUTH COME.
[1:38:07] LET US BE ON FIRE FOR OUR GENERATION.
[1:38:11] EVERYONE AROUND US MUST KNOW GOD HAS
[1:38:14] SENT A PROPHET WITH A MESSAGE OF
[1:38:16] RESTORATION.
[1:38:20] THIS IS A TOKEN MESSAGE.
[1:38:24] And this sister took that little track
[1:38:27] in this because she was going into this
[1:38:29] institution.
[1:38:31] And brother Tesa happens to be doing
[1:38:33] some accounting work for that
[1:38:34] institution
[1:38:36] and she gives this truck to this man and
[1:38:39] the man was attracted
[1:38:42] and he came he said I would like to meet
[1:38:44] your pastors. Some of our team told me
[1:38:47] about him.
[1:38:48] to be ina
[1:38:50] with brother. We sit down with him, not
[1:38:54] one time, not two times,
[1:38:58] many times. As one of the pastors here
[1:39:01] preached,
[1:39:03] there is always that supernatural
[1:39:04] element.
[1:39:08] Let me tell you, no one can say I
[1:39:10] brought someone into the message.
[1:39:13] NO one can claim that. No one can claim
[1:39:16] that. AMEN. NO ONE BROUGHT YOU TO THE
[1:39:18] MESSAGE. IT'S ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAD A
[1:39:20] SEED OF GOD IN YOU.
[1:39:24] WHEN THE WORD CAME TO YOU, YOU REALIZE
[1:39:27] YOUR TRUE ORIGIN
[1:39:29] AND YOU RECEIVED THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:39:31] HOUR.
[1:39:32] AMEN. And so when he came to and we know
[1:39:34] we talked and talked
[1:39:37] and he could not get it. But one day a
[1:39:41] supernatural element kicked in.
[1:39:47] I've seen it and I would like to be
[1:39:49] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus.
[1:39:54] One day I'm preaching in his church
[1:39:57] of God comes upon me and a song comes to
[1:40:00] mind. Let's begin singing that song.
[1:40:03] We're going to sing that song in Christ.
[1:40:05] Give me truth, mercy.
[1:40:09] But I tell you friends,
[1:40:11] brother is one of those
[1:40:15] God has anointed
[1:40:17] with the desire
[1:40:20] to see this message spread across the
[1:40:22] world.
[1:40:25] I never expect that you are you've gone
[1:40:27] this far. This is wonderful.
[1:40:34] you this man can preach anywhere.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Well, if you want to invite him to your
[1:40:40] church, that's
[1:40:43] why I know you are leaving. He's leaving
[1:40:44] right away on Monday or something like
[1:40:46] that. We are happy to have you here.
[1:40:48] Thank you so much. God bless you. Let us
[1:40:51] give a clap of praise to the Lord for
[1:40:52] you.
[1:40:55] When you go back to Ethiopia,
[1:40:57] we send our greetings.
[1:41:00] I'm going to have this
[1:41:02] always with methopia.
[1:41:07] You are always going to have that with
[1:41:08] me
[1:41:10] praying for Ethiopia. My voice is
[1:41:12] beginning to go. I'll do something about
[1:41:13] it. But listen,
[1:41:16] as we dismiss, we are going to be here
[1:41:18] uh at 9:15
[1:41:21] Sunday morning.

[1:41:26] speak to us.
[1:41:28] Prayed up. I'm expectant.
[1:41:30] If there are those gifted with prayer
[1:41:32] and intercession,
[1:41:34] if there are those who are gifted with
[1:41:35] prayer and
[1:41:40] come to meetings like this,
[1:41:43] it's always good you step back and pray
[1:41:46] for the service if you can. The man I
[1:41:50] told you about, come here, brother
[1:41:52] Brian.
[1:41:54] This is the man I told you about.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:00] Uh, you got a baby girl
[1:42:03] and she's alive. I gave the testimony.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you.

[1:42:15] sing this. My voice is gone. Amen. All
[1:42:19] my life
