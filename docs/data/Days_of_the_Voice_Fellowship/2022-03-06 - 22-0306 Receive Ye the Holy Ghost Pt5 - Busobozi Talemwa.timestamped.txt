[5:34] [Music]
[5:58] [Music]
[6:04] and we believe
[6:50] [Music]
[7:17] hallelujah i mean
[7:19] before you see it let's just go through
[7:21] this uh scripture straight away first
[7:34] and um
[7:38] we are going to the book of genesis once
[7:39] again
[7:42] [Music]
[7:43] this is part 5 of the series that we've
[7:45] been speaking on receiving the holy
[7:47] ghost
[7:53] oh
[8:05] [Music]
[8:10] amen all right so we read genesis
[8:13] chapter two
[8:18] verse 21
[8:22] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to
[8:24] fall upon adam
[8:27] and he slapped
[8:30] and he took one of his ribs and closed
[8:33] up the flesh in
[8:35] instead thereof
[8:37] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[8:41] from the man made he a woman
[8:44] and brought her unto the man
[8:47] and adam said this is now one of my
[8:50] bonds and flesh of my flesh it shall
[8:52] be called woman because she has been
[8:54] taken out of the man
[9:03] [Music]
[9:34] remember that woman means taken out of
[9:36] the man
[9:40] and eve means
[9:42] mother of all living
[9:45] [Music]
[9:47] so
[9:48] eve was meaning mother of the bird and
[9:51] the good
[9:52] challenge
[9:55] mother of kings
[9:57] but adam was not meaning father of king
[9:59] and about
[10:00] adam challenged his attack
[10:15] and
[10:16] then here we see that she was taken out
[10:18] of the man one of them
[10:21] this man in the image of god
[10:24] her name was woman
[10:26] meaning a part of the man
[10:30] praise the lord and so here on verse 7
[10:35] he says and the lord god formed man out
[10:37] of the dust of the ground breathed into
[10:38] his nose please the breath of life and
[10:40] man became a living soul
[10:43] video
[11:15] i want to greet you all in the precious
[11:17] name of jesus christ my name is
[11:19] christopher a blessing and a privilege
[11:21] to be in the house of the lord this

[12:53] but uh as always i always want to just
[12:55] approach the world immediately directly
[13:00] and then we can always do the rest of
[13:01] the announcements and everything later
[13:03] every single day to record it in the
[13:31] something new that maybe perhaps you may
[13:33] not follow me well uh this is part 5.

[13:44] to go and follow up
[14:01] that we count all the coldness out there
[14:04] we've already had a wonderful worship at
[14:06] the nox sins and now we should be ready
[14:08] to receive the word
[14:11] you know whenever you go you come to
[14:12] church you should be ready to say amen
[14:41] and so i think today will be part two of
[14:43] the blood
[14:46] i will continue to speak a little bit on
[14:47] that
[14:49] connection with the holy spirit
[14:53] now then then the same day at evening
[14:57] being the first day of the week
[14:59] when the doors were shut where the
[15:02] disciples were assembled
[15:05] where the disciples were assembled
[15:07] for fear of the jews came jesus and
[15:10] stood in the midst and saith unto them
[15:12] peace be unto you
[15:17] and 2019.
[15:49] amen i mean and when he had so said he
[15:52] showed unto them his hands and his side
[15:58] again
[16:00] now while we are still reading john 20.
[16:06] i hope i hope i don't lose any of you i
[16:08] want you to follow me close
[16:12] this is a very sensitive scripture every
[16:14] year
[16:16] and my prayer is that you will receive a
[16:18] revelation
[16:28] as we are still reading here not just
[16:31] someone i want us to look
[16:33] at what we have read now i i know you
[16:35] you you can have you if you have a bible
[16:37] you can open it back
[16:39] both ways well i want us to look at john
[16:42] 20 and look at genesis
[16:46] okay you can have
[17:04] [Music]
[17:16] god caused a deep sleep to fall on adam
[17:19] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[17:21] and closed
[17:22] up up the flesh instead they arrowed
[17:43] god took out a rib out
[17:53] and here the lord comes from the
[17:54] resurrection
[17:58] after the resurrection
[18:00] and he meets the disciples
[18:03] and he tells them
[18:05] peace be unto you
[18:08] amen
[18:09] so i am peacefully went to sleep
[18:28] [Music]
[19:08] then
[19:27] and the lord god calls the deep sleep
[19:29] and then after that he says he took one
[19:32] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[19:34] instead they are wrong
[19:36] [Music]
[19:46] and when he had so said
[19:49] when he had so say
[20:05] me
[20:07] then he showed unto them his hand i will
[20:10] never again economy and his side no
[20:15] are you following me
[20:17] there is something about the side
[20:20] whatever
[20:22] of jesus
[20:24] that it was very identical to the side
[20:27] of adam why the way to find a chimpanzee
[20:46] jesus the wife of adam came out of the
[20:49] ribs of of adam machado
[20:52] this is adam
[20:53] when god created the adam please follow
[20:55] me here and i would say bring this
[20:56] foundation here that throne that we are
[20:58] turned adam he
[21:00] spoke
[21:02] are you following me
[21:05] oh my there are many revelations going
[21:06] through my mind right now i pray that
[21:08] you will open your mind to receive it
[21:11] when god spoke in genesis chapter one
[21:41] i was always getting confused when i
[21:43] read that
[21:45] but when i read the message
[21:47] when i heard the message
[21:49] all
[21:50] had meaning
[21:54] so in genesis 1
[21:56] we see
[22:22] because he was in the image of god
[22:39] is
[22:41] more children into existence
[22:44] these children have the character and
[22:46] the image of god
[22:49] amen just like adam and eve
[22:52] we're
[23:06] and now he begins
[23:48] all right all right let's take it a
[23:50] little slow here
[23:53] then he says
[23:54] then jesus said that to them again yes
[23:58] after he had showed them his side
[24:01] of his hands
[24:04] [Music]
[24:18] as my father sent me next time even so
[24:20] send are you remember and then when he
[24:23] had said this
[24:25] when he had saved me
[24:28] he believed on them
[25:26] all right now
[25:27] we notice
[25:33] that
[25:34] jesus yes you
[25:38] he tells them to receive the holy ghost
[25:39] yeah
[25:54] instead of being
[25:57] i don't know i don't know how to explain
[25:58] to you well figure it out if you can't
[26:00] do it that's okay
[26:02] hallelujah i mean
[26:06] in genesis chapter two or very very
[26:08] strong
[26:12] he says to this man he had molded out of
[26:15] the dust of the moon
[26:19] he actually says to that man the same
[26:23] thing jesus said when he rose from the
[26:24] crowd
[26:34] i want you to understand here
[26:37] that by the time jesus
[26:40] braved his breath
[26:47] there was not seen yet
[26:57] jesus yes would not
[27:00] breathe on the people
[27:04] the bible says he
[27:33] in other words
[27:34] you can only be in that image explaining
[27:37] it to someone achieving them before the
[27:38] fall
[27:40] you can only be in the image of god
[27:43] before the fall
[27:46] but then
[27:57] [Music]
[28:14] everybody
[28:43] the only difference in your car is
[28:46] that has not maybe manifested in you in
[28:48] a greater way
[28:53] you find the thief they are beating oh
[28:55] sorry
[29:02] [Music]
[29:38] i wanted to look at genesis 2 once again
[29:56] of the lord
[30:03] and the lord
[30:05] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[30:08] from the man
[30:10] made he a woman
[30:12] and brought her unto the man
[30:20] too
[31:17] hallelujah
[31:37] all right good to go amen
[31:40] and i told you and i probably several
[31:42] times the reason why jesus came was to
[31:43] die on the cross
[31:59] the origin
[32:03] you can only be redeemed
[32:06] back to where you were not this is there
[32:10] are some souls in this world that are
[32:12] not redeemable
[32:17] because they do not have the seed of god
[32:21] no matter what you do they can never
[32:23] receive the holy ghost
[32:26] no matter what you do they
[32:54] in the beginning
[32:56] in the image of god in furniture
[32:59] let us create man in our image
[33:02] was in the image of god
[33:05] and adam and eve was in adam
[33:08] adam
[33:21] somebody was telling me the other day
[33:36] i
[34:18] the fact
[35:43] amen could not let his seed
[35:47] go to annihilation
[35:51] god could never accept
[35:54] a seed
[35:55] in his image
[36:15] [Music]
[36:39] um i always speak for an hour i hope
[36:41] that that would be to about 12.
[36:43] so by one i'll be done
[36:45] hallelujah i mean
[36:48] so i wanted to follow me with all your
[36:49] chickens
[36:51] and so adam adam
[36:53] was then
[36:54] his nature was perverted
[36:59] and all his children
[37:01] were perverted
[37:04] we were born in a perverted way
[37:20] that's why when jesus came up yesterday
[37:22] he was not able to breathe on the people
[37:28] and to tell them receive the holy ghost
[37:32] before they are redeemed
[38:01] only by being a part of a society
[38:11] remember the other man who came to jesus
[38:26] [Applause]
[38:30] he even smiling immediately
[38:33] and he said i've been doing all these
[38:35] works of the love from the since i was a
[38:36] baby
[38:40] i was wearing a long scarf
[38:43] about having no earrings
[40:06] [Music]
[40:34] yes would not breathe on them
[41:24] [Music]
[42:14] oh

[46:26] and puts
[46:34] [Music]
[46:40] even your salvation
[47:09] hallelujah amen and so
[47:12] when
[47:13] jesus yes you went oh glory to god he
[47:17] went on the cross
[47:20] you know everything was already
[47:22] prophesied
[48:03] the moment you received
[48:46] because of your
[49:38] and when he killed all of them down the
[49:40] line
[49:41] would never take over
[49:42] he thought
[50:22] [Music]
