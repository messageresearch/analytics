[31:19] of from a man who
[31:23] had the greatest wisdom on earth
[31:32] and he says again what i applied my
[31:35] heart to know
[31:37] and to search
[31:39] and to seek out wisdom
[31:41] and the reason of things and to know the
[31:43] wickedness of foley even of foolishness
[31:46] and madness

[32:16] whose heart is snares and nets
[32:19] and her hands as bands
[32:22] who so pleases god shall escape from her
[32:26] but the sinner shall be taken by her

[33:23] evening light brighter banaco
[33:30] evening light
[33:32] so i took one i spoke on this subject
[33:35] that is just last night
[33:44] [Music]
[33:49] so i preached
[33:51] to them
[33:52] first but you are hearing the message
[33:54] first
[33:59] this message
[34:01] the subject
[34:03] but i i know i will not finish this
[34:06] subject also tonight
[34:11] uh i will check it again maybe on sunday
[34:13] the lord willing
[34:17] uh brother you're
[34:44] [Music]
[35:01] it is in christ alone
[35:04] where the bride should come hey yo
[35:08] you are in christ no matter where you
[35:10] are
[35:14] when the trumpet sounds
[35:16] you will find you ready in the right
[35:18] place
[35:22] grace you will be able to go for the
[35:23] rapture
[35:26] praise the name of the lord
[35:28] so tonight we are speaking on the snares
[35:30] of a child of god
[35:35] can you find a better word for snails
[35:38] yes that's the old word
[35:41] the snares of a child of god a young man
[35:44] now we all here are children of god for
[35:46] now everyone knows
[35:48] these words were spoken by a man who was
[35:50] the man with the greatest wisdom in the
[35:52] world
[35:56] and he said that
[35:58] i find more bitter than death the woman
[36:00] argument
[36:02] is snares and nets
[36:10] timber can you read that again in uganda
[36:14] verse 26
[36:25] okay read it this way
[36:27] and i find more bitter than death
[36:38] the woman oh mukazee whose heart is
[36:42] snares and nets
[36:45] [Music]
[36:47] and her bun under her hands as bands
[36:50] name econo jay bianca you see and he
[36:53] says that whosoever pleases the lord
[36:56] he has sent you some camera
[36:58] he will escape from her
[37:00] but the sinner will not the sinner it
[37:03] shall be taken by her
[37:06] own
[37:09] friends i think a woman is a great thing
[37:14] but the banham said that the next best
[37:17] thing that a man can get aside from
[37:19] salvation organization
[37:33] it can be the worst thing that a man can
[37:36] get in here
[37:41] if he does not marry a good wife
[37:45] and so when we talk about a woman
[37:52] you see by the bottom say that if you
[37:54] want to see the nature if you want to
[37:56] see the church the the character of the
[37:58] church
[38:02] look
[38:16] themselves around men
[38:20] that shows you the character of that
[38:21] child
[38:24] and also we know that
[38:26] the church itself
[38:28] is typed as a woman
[38:49] [Music]
[38:58] that kind of a woman
[39:01] after what he claims to be homosexual
[39:04] no matter how he shows and portrays
[39:06] himself
[39:09] it shows what kind of a man he is
[39:29] [Applause]
[39:38] [Music]
[39:56] maybe it depends on what type of woman
[39:58] we are talking about
[40:01] you see it is so important
[40:04] she is so important
[40:06] but even the devil
[40:08] himself he was not having he did not
[40:11] have the ability to get to adam they
[40:13] have several funerals
[40:17] but he needed without the assistance of
[40:19] a woman
[40:21] because he needed to use the woman in
[40:23] the garden of eden
[40:26] but the bible comes back later in the
[40:28] book of first timothy chapter 2
[40:33] and they say that a woman was in the
[40:35] transgression
[40:48] but i want to show you also that the
[40:49] woman is so much important
[40:54] not only
[40:56] for the bad reasons
[41:00] but also for the good reasons
[41:03] god could not save the world
[41:19] come without a woman
[41:22] because a prophecy was already given
[41:26] the book of genesis
[41:28] he says that the seed of the serpent
[41:32] shall
[41:43] [Music]
[42:13] now of course you see how important a
[42:15] woman is
[42:18] and and angel came to mary and say that
[42:21] uh you are blessed hail mary you are
[42:23] blessed among women
[42:28] and indeed
[42:42] is
[42:51] because we know that jesus was not as it
[42:53] was not
[42:54] an offspring of mary
[42:58] but jesus was an offspring of god
[43:01] whoever yes
[43:03] he was the seed of god in that way
[43:07] but why does the bible call her the seed
[43:08] of the woman
[43:10] is
[43:23] [Music]
[43:37] [Music]
[43:42] [Applause]
[43:46] [Music]
[43:52] his own
[43:56] [Applause]
[44:04] so you can see how important a woman is
[44:35] [Music]
[44:47] it takes one woman
[44:51] [Applause]
[45:45] and that was eve
[45:46] coward do you see how strong a woman can
[45:49] be about ammonia
[45:52] and here is the man with the greatest
[45:54] wisdom on the earth
[45:58] and he comes and he
[46:04] [Music]
[46:12] whose heart is snares and necks
[46:20] praise the name of the lord
[46:26] so there is a woman white woman
[46:28] but her heart
[46:30] humanity my way snares and nets
[46:35] what is a snare
[46:37] oh
[46:38] a snare is a controver a
[46:42] often consisting of a noose or a rope
[46:45] for entangling birds or mammals
[46:53] um
[47:05] something deceptively attractive
[47:23] oh my god
[47:25] our heart is that type that entangles
[47:27] speak other people
[47:33] that that involves people in
[47:34] difficulties
[48:04] through the the the the the story of
[48:07] samson
[48:10] how god had given samson the greatest
[48:12] strength on earth
[48:32] why because the lighter's heart was
[48:34] snares and nets
[48:40] how many have ever set up a snare but
[48:44] all right
[48:46] you have never set up any snare sister
[48:50] yes that's a snap
[48:53] all right now inserting a snare
[48:57] consideration is made as to what exactly
[49:00] which
[49:01] as to what
[49:03] is meant as to exactly which
[49:05] are the usual parts of the target
[49:14] when you are setting up a target for the
[49:16] ride but when you're setting up a trap
[49:18] for the rack but won't take a message
[49:21] you don't just set it up anywhere
[49:22] tomorrow
[49:25] not so similar why
[49:28] because these kind these wraps
[49:31] you know in the house how a specific
[49:33] path they take
[49:37] so when you're setting a snare
[49:40] you said you consider the usual path of
[49:43] your target
[49:48] this could be past leading to food
[49:54] already made it
[49:55] to desires so very
[50:24] and
[50:37] and then you put something like a what a
[50:40] rat doesn't eat no take away
[50:44] you cannot do that
[50:47] if you want to drop a rat we're gonna
[50:49] take a minute you will put something it
[50:52] usually or take away cheating messages
[50:55] you will put some fish or take a cat
[50:58] canyon you will put something that you
[51:00] have like nuts
[51:03] something which will attract
[51:05] the right i can't i can ask
[51:08] and of course you know that you're
[51:09] putting that trap or that snare in the
[51:11] path of that rack
[51:20] so snares are laid even in the world for
[51:22] people who go hunting
[51:28] they put those snares in the world in
[51:30] the usual path the animals take but
[51:33] again
[51:36] if you are going to put a snare for
[51:39] let's say uh cheetah or something of the
[51:41] country
[51:44] you cannot again put a trap that would
[51:47] drop a rat i need to take care of myself
[51:51] you have to put a a trap or a snare the
[51:55] size of your target or tigger
[51:58] or when cannon opening and nature are
[52:00] you following me
[52:02] this is how they lay a snail wait a
[52:03] minute again
[52:07] and then you know
[52:08] if you're you're trying to trap uh uh
[52:12] you know this
[52:13] will be pigs
[52:17] you know how to trap them angrily oh man
[52:20] you know where it usually passes
[52:23] i know what it is
[52:26] where it goes for food
[52:29] where it goes for whatever reason
[52:33] and then you will find those parts
[52:36] and try and lay a snare
[52:40] come on
[52:41] hallelujah i mean now friends
[52:44] in the same way
[52:50] [Music]
[52:55] [Music]
[52:57] now this type of a woman
[53:00] she is intending to drop somebody
[53:06] now of course
[53:10] they must be the target why do you not
[53:12] buy which
[53:25] who is this woman
[53:54] but
[54:22] a snare
[54:24] [Music]
[54:30] it's all about laying people in bondage
[54:32] that you need
[54:35] to move it's all about strength
[54:50] she is going to let the snare i could
[54:52] take caretakers for people now go take a
[54:55] bantu
[54:56] in there you use your parts
[55:00] i hope somebody's following me
[55:03] hallelujah hallelujah let us first read
[55:06] one scripture so you can be able to get
[55:08] ah
[55:10] speaking about
[55:14] hallelujah
[55:20] by my mind
[55:26] read now revelation 17
[55:32] is
[55:40] and there came one of the seven angels
[55:42] which had the seven vials
[55:44] and talked with me saying unto me come
[55:46] heather i will show unto thee the
[55:48] judgment of the great wall that's seated
[55:50] upon them upon many waters
[56:29] is a woman
[56:32] are you following me
[56:34] she's a woman
[56:36] you you read first to you is what i'm
[56:38] talking about
[56:55] in english it says the inhabitants of
[56:58] the earth
[56:59] have made been made drunk with the wine
[57:02] of heart
[57:03] fornication
[57:09] verse 3 so he carried me and went the
[57:11] spirit into the wilderness and i saw a
[57:13] woman
[57:14] sit upon a sketch cannot be full of
[57:16] names of blasphemy having seven heads
[57:18] and seven horns
[57:35] amen now we find out that this woman
[57:41] [Music]
[57:52] the waters are symbolizing people's
[57:54] nations and tanks
[58:03] if you if you read the world chapter you
[58:05] will get a lot of
[58:06] the interpretations
[58:31] that we are believers of the message
[58:32] because for us we have more teachings
[59:17] she has overcome the world inside you
[59:19] and here all the good kings of the world
[59:44] not
[59:56] she claimed that jesus was her husband
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:01:09] from the government program government
[1:01:13] don't think it's going to attack us from
[1:01:15] the politicians
[1:01:50] is
[1:02:04] what is
[1:03:00] within
[1:03:29] since they needed a worship stone
[1:03:31] worship the creation of god
[1:03:36] within them
[1:03:39] to worship one word
[1:03:42] that the devil knows we must take
[1:03:45] citadel i need to take it
[1:03:47] when you come in the bible
[1:03:48] you find that apostle paul came to a
[1:03:50] place
[1:03:51] right now
[1:03:52] found people worshipping
[1:03:54] and they did not know that god
[1:04:10] the name
[1:05:34] if god took you out of your denomination
[1:05:37] and then you feel the first to go back
[1:05:42] you have never found god
[1:05:45] means you have never met god
[1:05:47] but if you met god one
[1:06:02] decide
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:58] but as long as
[1:07:12] [Music]
[1:08:28] do you know what it means to worship god
[1:08:29] in the spirit and in truth oh that
[1:08:31] doorman changed the results
[1:08:33] but when you come to church there was
[1:08:35] another spectator
[1:08:39] that when you come to church never james
[1:08:41] can you say you are a participant
[1:08:44] that's the reason why we left the
[1:08:46] baptist churches and the other foreign
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:29] some of you have never been in those
[1:09:31] denominations you may not understand
[1:09:45] and the people's work is to cheat and
[1:09:46] enjoy
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:33] [Applause]
[1:11:24] whereby we don't only act in the church
[1:11:29] but even when we go outside
[1:11:32] today when we live the life of the
[1:11:34] gospel
[1:11:36] we experience a living god to
[1:13:18] so maybe you want to go back and listen
[1:13:19] on the archives
[1:13:23] hallelujah
[1:13:25] now i'll read a quote here and as i
[1:13:26] continue to preach
[1:13:29] praise the name of the
[1:13:30] lord it is more worthy of not that
[1:13:34] the very name satire means dominating
[1:13:36] female 1
[1:14:19] even when you join them
[1:14:22] they make you sign on a book somewhere
[1:14:26] quandary
[1:14:52] our souls are owned by god himself
[1:14:56] for he is the past and bishop of our
[1:14:58] souls
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:01] of faith and we are not controlled by a
[1:15:03] church a referendum
[1:15:05] we are not controlled by a church system
[1:15:09] [Applause]
[1:15:37] i'm coming back that's his message
[1:15:39] our sisters
[1:15:41] in their right places moving forward
[1:15:44] will be too full of a place of obedience
[1:15:48] of subjection
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:16:04] having you are looking down on a woman i
[1:16:06] got my name ammonium
[1:16:08] and certain times it seems as though
[1:16:11] they don't
[1:16:13] that you are taking their rights away
[1:16:24] the moment we come to the knowledge of
[1:16:26] jesus christ we're too many years to
[1:16:28] christian and we accept him as lord of
[1:16:30] our souls
[1:16:46] them be here you'll be able i'm going
[1:16:48] more dead because the bible says
[1:16:51] submit yourselves to your own husbands
[1:16:53] in every city
[1:16:56] so you have given away your rights
[1:17:00] that's why the bible
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:40] you find a woman in a miniskirt
[1:17:55] they call themselves
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:28] so the moment we married the christ
[1:18:31] returned and into four christians to
[1:18:33] give away our rights to him
[1:18:37] we have no rights to fight for the two
[1:18:39] children
[1:18:42] can i hear and i mean so that's why
[1:18:43] they want me you have no rights to fight
[1:18:45] for the truth
[1:18:48] that's why my sister
[1:18:49] the moment you agreed to marry that man
[1:19:06] they
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:34] is
[1:19:48] spirit no kidding
[1:19:51] obedience
[1:19:53] holy spirit
[1:19:54] teach you submission
[1:19:59] not as a woman
[1:20:01] but also as a church
[1:20:16] where we
[1:20:44] the whitest man in the world ever saw
[1:20:47] was solomon
[1:20:48] um
[1:20:51] and he said
[1:20:53] i applied my heart to no one to search
[1:20:55] and to seek out wisdom
[1:21:02] [Music]
[1:21:24] foreign
[1:21:28] are the snares and nets
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:55] [Music]
[1:22:08] the lord
[1:22:12] let me tell you church of god
[1:22:15] you please the lord will send yourself
[1:22:18] escaped from the clouds and the bones of
[1:22:20] this kind of woman
[1:22:36] from the
[1:23:05] yes
[1:23:06] she is according to the holy scripture
[1:23:08] to be submissive to the man
[1:23:13] not to be submissive when your husband
[1:23:15] makes you happy
[1:23:18] not to be submissive when your husband
[1:23:20] tells you what you want to hear
[1:23:24] not to be submissive when your husband
[1:23:26] braves you
[1:23:29] but to be submissive
[1:23:33] it is the laws of god
[1:23:36] because it types the spiritual command
[1:23:39] memorial that is commanded of her
[1:23:44] woman who is truly female or mukesh
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:14] oh
[1:24:18] [Applause]
[1:24:43] if you find a man abusing a woman almost
[1:24:46] younger
[1:24:47] whether or not is his wife obama has to
[1:24:50] oversee him that's not a real man it
[1:24:52] seems like you're a normal daughter
[1:24:54] a real man inside your name do not treat
[1:25:12] for he is the head of the house
[1:25:16] but remember that if you're the head of
[1:25:18] the house
[1:25:20] the woman is your queen
[1:25:22] so you treat her like a queen
[1:25:26] if she breaks that image that god made
[1:25:28] for her
[1:25:33] she is perverted
[1:25:35] and any male that lets the woman take
[1:25:37] authority has also broken that image and
[1:25:40] he is all supervised
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:51] he gives us a reason he says that is why
[1:25:54] a woman cannot wear that which pertains
[1:26:04] that's why she doesn't cut her hair
[1:26:20] means even
[1:26:35] to wear garments that pertain to a male
[1:26:37] or cutter
[1:26:41] when she dies she is intruding into the
[1:26:44] male domain taking authority and
[1:26:46] perverting herself
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:54] and when a woman invades
[1:26:56] the pulpit which is commanded she must
[1:26:59] not do she shows what speech she is oh
[1:27:02] hero
[1:27:12] hallelujah i mean being a dominating
[1:27:14] female is antichrist
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:18] [Applause]
[1:27:20] and the seeds of the of the roman
[1:27:22] catholic church are in her
[1:27:24] though she may deny this superhero
[1:27:27] name
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:05] hallelujah
[1:29:22] she has
[1:29:29] when it comes to the word
[1:29:33] let god be true in every manner
[1:30:01] because the true female is submissive to
[1:30:04] god
[1:30:18] she has no thoughts
[1:30:32] before you do anything
[1:30:42] if your head ship says yes then you go
[1:30:44] ahead and come over again
[1:30:51] and then he says agamba but what about
[1:30:54] this church
[1:30:55] can you say no she has cast out the word
[1:30:58] yeah
[1:31:01] destroy the bibles and what the essence
[1:31:02] of the godly
[1:31:04] nazi kill is the bible is your name
[1:31:08] she has slain those who
[1:31:10] would preach the truth
[1:31:14] she has taken over kings princes and
[1:31:16] nations
[1:31:20] she controls armies and insists that she
[1:31:22] is the true body of christ
[1:31:28] that her popes are the vicars of christ
[1:31:33] christians she is entirely seduced by
[1:31:35] the devil oh you ascend the west in the
[1:31:38] west
[1:31:39] until she is in in turn until she in
[1:31:42] turn has become the seducer of others
[1:31:49] she is the bride of saturn
[1:31:53] and she oh my goodness and she has
[1:31:55] produced his bastard
[1:32:09] um
[1:32:39] but i thank god there is a bride of
[1:32:40] christ and never said to the white woman
[1:32:43] who will be submissive to every word of
[1:32:45] god
[1:32:48] i am the bride of christ
[1:32:51] hallelujah
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:21] and the devil through this system has
[1:33:22] used the paths of worship to lay a snare
[1:33:24] for the children
[1:33:32] so you find people
[1:34:02] a
[1:34:17] yara tigger you find bastards
