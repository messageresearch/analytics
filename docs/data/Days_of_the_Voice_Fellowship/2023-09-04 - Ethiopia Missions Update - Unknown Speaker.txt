========================================

my wife and I a few years ago took a trip to uh to Ethiopia Ethiopia but uh before we got married we knew that the Lord had a you know a mission for us there tonight it started about three years before I I got married actually and I wanted to go to Ethiopia because at that time I was you know traveling from place to place [Music] you know several African countries but now it became intense in 2011 when I went to Zimbabwe for a mission trip it would appear that whenever I open my bible to read God will draw my attention on Ethiopia Ethiopia I would read about Ethiopia guys so much even places I never expected the Bible was speaking about Ethiopia I would say Ethiopia and so when I returned home then I I um Pastor my pastor then Pastor Leo invited a Vista from Congo I think um and spoke about Ethiopia like he's mentioned about Ethiopia about 10 times and so it drew my attention [Music] now wanting to find out whether they were Believers in Ethiopians it turned out that there seemed not to be a church even a church of the message in Ethiopia so one time I went to sorority Pastor Charles introduced me to a brother who had been in Ethiopia um this brother had visited another brother in Ethiopia so apparently this brother was from Kenya yeah and so we tried to contact him to allow us to come and visit this is what he told me he said well of course after several words that were exchanged and he had asked me a few questions like how old are you numbers are you married are you a preacher how long did you start preaching from the time you believed foreign and then he asked me a little more questions and then it seemed that I failed the interview [Music] I'm sorry I cannot receive you in Ethiopia and also it doesn't seem that uh the field is large two friends you don't even have money and it's expensive yeah even the language is difficult they don't speak English so it's difficult for me to receive you here I cannot sustain you the sins are Queen Elizabeth and I don't feel like to receive you the field is large singers if God has sent you you will take care of it that's what he told me and I was so disappointed [Music] friends sometimes when you are turned down [Music] it doesn't mean that God has turned you down [Music] sometimes when you are turned down it is that God is opening and so I was turned down and um but somehow because of that I went before the Lord and I prayed a sincere prayer say Lord if it is your will for me to go to Ethiopia may you provide to me the money sent that I would not have to ask anybody because I need money to go there you and um also I said Lord may you also give me a contact someone I will not need to beg to come so uh about a year and a half later in 2013. I was supposed to get married actually I was supposed to get married in December of 2012. but then I saw this dream and in this dream I I saw myself um change someone asking me to change my wedding date this would be a signature that person that will ask me to do that will be the one to solemnize my wedding so I shared that with my pastor at that time we read about it and ignored it two weeks later out of all the friends and brothers in the ministry that I had sent out email to inform them about my wedding one of them wrote back and and he told me look he said brother brother we are our church is intending to have their students because they have a church school to come to Uganda Uganda we are going to visit Pastor Stephen ibalist Church in ginger together if you accepted me to come I said if you accepted to change your debts from December to March when we are when they are coming because my daughter is coming with them I will take it as from the Lord also for me to come along so this dream this what this email was saying was exactly revealed to me in the dream two weeks before it happened so it was not a problem I told Pastor Leo he had already known about it was the one supposed to Wed me and my wife eventually God had already organized for this brother to come and wear them yeah but here is what we did not know God was also dealing with him and and his church in Canada about Ethiopia they had a burden to support the working ethics mechanism but they had the money to go yeah and I was in Uganda you don't have the money to go because I didn't have the money but I want you to see God working on both sides so when this brother comes to Uganda received him at the airport with the other Elders they were about 17 young people that came with them so he said where are you going to your honeymoon [Music] and they said we are not planning a honeymoon because we have all the resources we put them in the wedding and since and so he said ah I have a proposal in each day so why don't you go to Ethiopia for your honeymoon years after the prayer I pray before I was ever in contact with this brother and and so at when he said he mentioned Ethiopia boy are you getting a question and he was saying honeymoon because this brother said I am going to take care of all the expenses [Music] but because of a prayer that God answered so perfect so perfect yeah three years before um all the money we needed is [Music] when the brothers and the sisters in our little church had that I was planning honeymoon to Ethiopia that is some of them were offended because I remember there was a family that sold their piglets to support my wedding so they said if we had money this was completely Supernatural and so now I'm on the computer with my wife and here's what God does someone calls me from Nairobi Nairobi never met him don't know him but he was on the internet internet and he read my website my website it says about me on our website website if you want you young people you can look for it the youth message site so you saw my testimony he was impressed that the Holy Spirit to invite me to Kenya and Peter Kenya to go and baptize the people that had believed under his ministries but here is the testimony those people were Ethiopians Ethiopia so when he mentioned to me I have a group of Ethiopians and God has told me ask you especially you um [Music] immediately I knew that that was God answering the second prayer please stay on the first slide so then when we are in Nairobi Nairobi uh this brother brings this man and uh and uh I I of course we changed our trip we decided to go to Nairobi fast and we met this Ethiopian man said and this man was uh very happy to see us yes it was the very first Ethiopian I've ever interacted with yeah said you were delaying 2012 I need to be baptized they took him at one of the neighboring churches the church we visited recently in Nairobi challenge that man there the traumatism in the name of our Lord Jesus he gave us a contact of his brothers foreign so that is that is me and my wife on our wedding day 2013. how it all started 2013. so give me the next slide so we go to Nairobi Network yeah just keep keep that on the next so when I said next you just click that it's the first time I do this so please excuse me so this is the man I don't know whether you can see him clearly there his name is I believe those who are online can view this better and if you want to view it in a better way you can view this after the service so uh you see the man standing behind there and if you see the man on the extreme right I always forget his name but maybe I'll remember it and so that is the man that called me and I met him there for the first time baptism Pastor rather the man called the reasons you can see I was very little and smaller but we had a fire of God in our house so you can see give me the next slide after also in Nairobi I was preaching there on the streets in the at the park it's called jivanji Park when I look there's a little video which was recorded of me preaching at that time I watched it and I saw how I was dressed and how small I was and I was just laughing at myself so while I was preaching give me the next slide and by the way go back there oh they this place recently when we were in Nairobi I don't know if Isaac and uh Isaac remembers you remember when we were coming out of the pastor's office do you remember the man that came and approached me yes so that man said yoyo believed from here yeah I was thinking that's how it will be in heaven people will come
