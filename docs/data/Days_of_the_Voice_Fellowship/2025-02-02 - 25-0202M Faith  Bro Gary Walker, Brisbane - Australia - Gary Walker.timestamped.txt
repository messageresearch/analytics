[26:31] reap yeah though we had some
[26:35] disturbances and that's why I'm here

[28:20] baldheaded look at look what they say to
[28:25] him they said go up thou bald
[28:30] head like Elijah want
[28:36] you like maybe your children moing
[28:38] preachers or

[28:51] it their priest and them had told their
[28:55] priests and them had told them now

[53:24] amen amen you may seated for just a few
[53:31] moments amen
[53:34] amen praise the
[53:36] Lord praise the
[53:38] Lord how many prayed for for us while we
[53:40] were
[53:42] in thank you for your
[53:44] prayers amen God answered your
[53:47] prayers it was not entirely an easy
[53:52] trip as far as um you know the Logistics
[53:57] and you know the
[54:01] movements uh because we our got an
[54:06] issue know the road from Moro
[54:10] to to ctio is not
[54:14] good so uh we had to Flat tires no not
[54:19] really flat tires one car actually
[54:21] completely bust
[54:27] and there was no no tire that could fit
[54:30] on
[54:33] our while we were returning to
[54:36] C
[54:39] fromo then even the spare tire
[54:45] gave so and it was in a very difficult
[54:51] spot I knew it because I had been told
[54:56] but I tried to behave and look like
[54:58] there was no problem because I had uh
[55:01] foreign
[55:04] brothers and I do not want to scare
[55:07] them you know if you're the pilot and
[55:10] and you know you look scared everybody
[55:11] will be
[55:15] scared so I tried to put up a very
[55:17] stable
[55:19] face but the fact is I was
[55:23] scared and you know uh you know about
[55:26] the cattle riders
[55:29] in and you know they could come any time
[55:33] we think there's stability but you never
[55:35] know what to
[55:37] expect and um you know it was around I
[55:40] think 3 400
[55:42] p.m. so some people gave us hope they're
[55:45] bringing a
[55:46] tire so we waited they brought several
[55:49] tires it all could not
[55:51] fix and so we were there up to around 8
[55:59] when now it on us that there's no other
[56:05] option so we now knew officially we are
[56:07] stranded in the middle of
[56:12] nowhere I asked a few people to pray my
[56:14] family and others I believe you
[56:17] pray and then someone came up and told
[56:20] us but there is a uh there is a um how
[56:25] do they a detach
[56:28] I at a certain close by
[56:31] school detach means a few maybe about 40
[56:37] soldiers um so we we told the other man
[56:41] said
[56:41] no that detach is not
[56:45] existent so we do not know who to
[56:48] believe but the one who was saying there
[56:50] is a
[56:52] detach was a brother the one who was
[56:56] saying there are no solders
[56:58] nothing is not a Believer so I chose to
[57:02] believe the
[57:03] believer because this other man who was
[57:06] not a Believer was suggesting to us that
[57:07] we could actually drive uh more than 17
[57:10] kmet on this tire on this spare tire
[57:13] which was almost completely getting
[57:21] green and you know if you reach in the
[57:23] middle and it is completely gone
[57:27] now the situation which was bad has
[57:29] become
[57:32] worse but you see the place where they
[57:34] were suggesting that there's soldiers
[57:37] about 2
[57:39] km so we I decided to drive the two
[57:43] k so the brothers were with hoed into
[57:46] the other
[57:47] car carried brother brother Walker and
[57:51] brother and uh we we we went to that
[57:55] place when we reached the
[57:57] gate it was a soldier with a
[58:00] gun full
[58:03] updf I was iide a side of
[58:06] relief so now we know that even if we
[58:09] were to sleep here at least we have
[58:14] protection and I asked this
[58:19] liant how many soldiers he
[58:22] had he said about 40 men
[58:26] so 2 kilm away from that
[58:29] incident I believe it was God who
[58:32] planned
[58:33] that that we shall have that
[58:37] security and I believe there were more
[58:39] with us than those who were physically
[58:41] keeping
[58:43] us it was a long day in
[58:46] cedo Brother Gary had preached two
[58:50] Services very tired all of us very tired
[58:54] Timothy was even helping change the
[58:59] and uh you know if I was Brother
[59:02] Gary I would never have looked for
[59:04] someone better to travel with
[59:08] me Timothy was a real real help to
[59:13] us and so um we were all tired all worn
[59:18] out um you know barely had
[59:21] sleep so I looked at Brother Gary I told
[59:25] him you're going to sleep here in the
[59:28] car he said it's all right whatever you
[59:31] say these brothers are
[59:35] Christians amen and so we were there I
[59:40] called up brother
[59:42] Andrew where is sister
[59:44] phib she in the
[59:46] building she she's out there I wish she
[59:49] was here physically to hear
[59:52] this brother if you could ask her to
[59:55] come in and so while stranded
[59:58] there I called brother Andrew you know
[1:00:01] brother Andrew he works in
[1:00:03] Mor I told him brother Andre we are
[1:00:07] stranded we don't know what to do and
[1:00:11] can you get a tire of course now Moro is
[1:00:14] about
[1:00:19] 162 from where we were even if they were
[1:00:22] going to send anything or send any help
[1:00:24] it would take about 2 three hours
[1:00:28] so brother Andrew quickly worked
[1:00:30] together with the other brothers brother
[1:00:32] Emanuel and brother benjam uel Benjamin
[1:00:35] and they the organized brother Benjamin
[1:00:38] um Emmanuel called
[1:00:40] mej he said pastor I have a
[1:00:43] car um for my friend my friend owns it
[1:00:47] so we could um incidentally I have it at
[1:00:50] this
[1:00:52] time so I could arrange and then come
[1:00:54] pick you up
[1:00:57] I said brother you were supposed to come
[1:01:00] ear
[1:01:02] come so he came together with brother
[1:01:04] Benjamin they drove more than two
[1:01:07] hours and then when we saw the lights
[1:01:11] coming I was just moving around by the
[1:01:13] Timothy
[1:01:14] around and we had sat and sat and tired
[1:01:19] so when we saw the lights
[1:01:21] coming like
[1:01:24] praise so the Brothers
[1:01:26] AR uh we we went into the
[1:01:29] car and off we went to Mor I was just
[1:01:33] praying Lord let us not have another
[1:01:36] problem with any tires
[1:01:39] here and we left our car
[1:01:42] there I told the soldier if you keep it
[1:01:45] well I'll make you happy so so they kept
[1:01:50] it well and the following day we got the
[1:01:52] car
[1:01:53] back after working on
[1:01:57] tires and the Lord did US
[1:02:01] good Saints we had a very wonderful
[1:02:05] meetings
[1:02:07] Ino about a thousand Believers or
[1:02:10] more and you know listen to the
[1:02:13] word and also we were in
[1:02:17] mat where we had um I don't really know
[1:02:20] the numbers but the brothers were
[1:02:21] estimating more than 2,000
[1:02:26] so they came from all over the side of
[1:02:29] napak
[1:02:32] District so it was really a good time
[1:02:35] with the
[1:02:36] Believers and we we we finished
[1:02:39] everything with a prayer
[1:02:42] line so I just wanted to say thank you
[1:02:44] for your
[1:02:45] prayers um those
[1:02:49] regions not many people even here in CA
[1:02:52] preachers want to go there
[1:02:56] because it is difficult to you know move
[1:02:59] around
[1:03:00] and deal with the
[1:03:03] people but God gave us
[1:03:05] Grace and the brothers were very good to
[1:03:08] us received us and and and you know God
[1:03:12] also gave grace to the ministering
[1:03:15] brother that he was very
[1:03:18] patient um you know they were they
[1:03:20] didn't give us
[1:03:21] trouble they were eating the food the
[1:03:23] people were eating there
[1:03:26] and I told Brother
[1:03:28] Gary and I know this is life it's all
[1:03:31] right I told him
[1:03:34] something I said I have been in contact
[1:03:37] with many brothers from the
[1:03:39] [Music]
[1:03:42] west but I made a
[1:03:45] comment and I said the last time I saw a
[1:03:49] Christian in the not to say that the
[1:03:52] others are not Christian but I said the
[1:03:53] last time I saw a Christian in this
[1:03:55] manner
[1:04:02] when I was interacting with brother
[1:04:05] Edis these brothers are really Believers
[1:04:09] of the
[1:04:11] message they they don't make you to feel
[1:04:14] that they are from another
[1:04:17] country
[1:04:19] special Brother Gary calls himself a
[1:04:23] servant and um I I think I'm so blessed
[1:04:26] to be associated with a man like
[1:04:29] that and so before we invite brother
[1:04:32] Gary I just want to give a little
[1:04:33] introduction of
[1:04:36] him years

[1:09:39] list and so Brother Gary was one of them
[1:09:43] and they to you know read those emails
[1:09:45] and see the testimonies of what
[1:09:48] the and so in about four years when the
[1:09:52] church was already
[1:09:53] established um and we're just now
[1:09:56] preaching we had a little
[1:09:58] congregation I don't remember how many
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:03] maybe then Brother Gary surprised me and
[1:10:07] he said he was coming to
[1:10:10] Ethiopia and uh I think he was going
[1:10:12] through going somewhere so by
[1:10:15] pastors so he came and uh he minister to
[1:10:19] the people then we were really blessed
[1:10:23] but then he God placed a burden in his
[1:10:27] he said uh do these people have the
[1:10:31] messages message books I told him no not
[1:10:36] yet he said he would like to buy for
[1:10:38] every
[1:10:41] family um um uh the library a library of
[1:10:46] the
[1:10:48] message all the available printed
[1:10:50] messages of brother
[1:10:53] bham so vot for those families I still
[1:10:57] remember a
[1:10:58] few there was Brother G
[1:11:01] family's family brother Ephraim AED I
[1:11:06] think a few other about
[1:11:08] 10es and um all these families he bought
[1:11:12] these books
[1:11:14] for the brothers are
[1:11:16] preachers of this
[1:11:19] message and um uh brother moras is the
[1:11:23] pastor of the church in
[1:11:26] where at the time we were
[1:11:29] pastoring and brother is working with
[1:11:33] him Brother G is doing his own
[1:11:37] work and brother Ephraim is also God is
[1:11:40] using him to do a wonderful work in the
[1:11:42] southern
[1:11:45] part actually he was telling me I I
[1:11:48] would not mention the number because
[1:11:50] I've not seen but he was telling me to
[1:11:51] expect hundreds of people
[1:11:56] because this week we are headed
[1:11:58] there we going to have a
[1:12:00] convention with only the people he has
[1:12:02] been reaching
[1:12:05] out him telling me hundreds I mean that
[1:12:08] must have been a lot of
[1:12:11] work and yet brother was the youngest
[1:12:15] among and so we talking about something
[1:12:18] like four years of
[1:12:20] work you know preaching the me this
[1:12:23] message is a lot of Labor
[1:12:26] it takes Grace no
[1:12:29] compromise having a back bone to stand
[1:12:32] for the
[1:12:33] truth because when you compromise many
[1:12:35] people can
[1:12:36] accept but when you stand for the truth
[1:12:39] many people don't but you see it takes a
[1:12:43] man to really have a backbone to
[1:12:47] start so just pray for us as we shall be
[1:12:50] going to
[1:12:51] aasa to have those meetings I'll be
[1:12:54] going with Brother G
[1:12:56] it be wonderful for him to
[1:12:58] see after so many years
[1:13:01] what and brother G has quite a
[1:13:04] testimony I was blessed to meet his
[1:13:09] wife uh when they came to Ethiopia they
[1:13:11] came
[1:13:12] together his wife wrote this
[1:13:15] book and if you see the title of this
[1:13:18] book it says three times
[1:13:22] dead but still alive
[1:13:27] and it was written by Deborah
[1:13:30] Walker
[1:13:32] now I know you're clapping but you don't
[1:13:34] know what it's all
[1:13:36] about if you want to know what it's all
[1:13:39] about be here at
[1:13:42] 4M we're going to have an interview by
[1:13:44] The
[1:13:48] Walker sister
[1:13:50] deor you know she has now gone on to be
[1:13:52] with the Lord
[1:13:55] but uh you know I met her in little
[1:13:58] conversations we
[1:14:00] had I now know because I've spent some
[1:14:04] little time with
[1:14:06] brother and I can tell you know even
[1:14:09] reading a few chapters
[1:14:11] here what kind of manner of woman she
[1:14:14] was uh these are real Believers of this
[1:14:18] message and not only Believers but they
[1:14:21] have also lived the life
[1:14:25] so here is a man that died three
[1:14:28] times but yet still
[1:14:31] alive I believe it is it was meant also
[1:14:35] for us to
[1:14:37] hear whatever God took him through he
[1:14:41] has been molding his
[1:14:42] character for such a time as
[1:14:45] this all the way from
[1:14:48] Australia just to come here and be a
[1:14:51] blessing to us maybe there might be
[1:14:53] someone
[1:14:55] suffering or going through certain you
[1:14:57] know difficult situations in
[1:14:59] life he is a man who has really
[1:15:02] suffered lost a lot and died once and
[1:15:06] twice and three times and but yet still
[1:15:09] alive to testify of the goodness
[1:15:11] of and um we have had myself a great
[1:15:15] opportunity to be with him in

[1:15:29] calm way I should
[1:15:31] say but at the at the end of the

[1:15:37] something so
[1:15:40] rich and you feel you have already

[1:21:51] very very far away Place AAL
[1:21:56] it took us nearly 36 hours to be
[1:22:00] here so we were're here and we're happy
[1:22:03] praise the
[1:22:05] Lord amen amen Jesus said in Luke
[1:22:13] 176 the Lord said if you have faith as
[1:22:16] the grain of mustard
[1:22:20] seed you might say unto the sore tree
[1:22:25] be thou plucked up by the
[1:22:27] root and be thou planted in the
[1:22:31] sea and it should obey
[1:22:35] you
[1:22:36] amen that's the word of Creation in your
[1:22:41] mouth now from the
[1:22:44] beginning God revealed himself right at
[1:22:46] the beginning as the
[1:22:49] Lord and then uh in The Exodus just
[1:22:52] before the Exodus God reveals himself as
[1:22:55] I
[1:22:59] am and then in Exodus
[1:23:01] 6 the Lord revealed himself as
[1:23:06] Jehovah so in the beginning he was
[1:23:08] showing us a little bit of
[1:23:11] himself as the Lord and then he showed
[1:23:15] himself as I
[1:23:23] amh thank you brother could you put it
[1:23:25] in the
[1:23:35] front again
[1:23:55] okay we got it we got it praise the Lord
[1:23:58] okay okay so the Lord revealed himself
[1:24:00] as the
[1:24:02] Lord and then he revealed himself as the
[1:24:05] the I
[1:24:06] am and then he showed us a little more
[1:24:09] of an angle of himself as
[1:24:14] Jehovah then in Joshua chapter 5 he
[1:24:17] shows himself as the captain of the
[1:24:21] host then in judges six he shows himself
[1:24:24] to Gideon as an old
[1:24:28] man in the gospels Jehovah revealed
[1:24:31] himself as Jesus of
[1:24:35] Nazareth in Mark 16 after the
[1:24:38] resurrection he showed himself in
[1:24:39] another
[1:24:42] form God has been showing us glimpses of
[1:24:48] himself because he's too great to to be
[1:24:51] revealed in one
[1:24:53] moment God is far too great to be
[1:24:57] described as soon as we try to describe
[1:25:00] him we reduce
[1:25:03] him because God is perfectly
[1:25:09] Indescribable in
[1:25:11] 1933 he revealed himself as a pillar of
[1:25:15] fire in
[1:25:17] 1963 he showed us a pillar of
[1:25:21] cloud which brother Bram said that's our
[1:25:23] Lord up there
[1:25:27] and now God is revealing himself in a
[1:25:29] multi-member
[1:25:33] body because right from the
[1:25:37] beginning brother brandom said God
[1:25:39] wanted to be the god of the
[1:25:43] audience the god of the
[1:25:47] audience amen that you were chosen in
[1:25:52] him not next to him
[1:25:55] not in front of him not behind him you
[1:25:58] were chosen in
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:02] him so right at the
[1:26:05] beginning before God was
[1:26:07] God before they were Angels before there
[1:26:11] was atoms before there was light before
[1:26:14] there was Darkness there was nothing
[1:26:18] only Jehovah God Elohim El the
[1:26:22] self-existing one
[1:26:25] and he spent all time and all
[1:26:28] space all by himself he was
[1:26:31] God there was nothing but
[1:26:34] God and you were chosen in
[1:26:38] him now God is too great to
[1:26:43] choose because he knows the beginning
[1:26:45] from the
[1:26:47] end so when God chose
[1:26:49] you he didn't go down to a supernatural
[1:26:52] Supermarket of souls again
[1:26:56] and say I'll have that one but I have
[1:26:59] that one and I'll have that one and I'll
[1:27:01] have that one but not that
[1:27:09] one we choose like
[1:27:12] that we use words to try to paint a
[1:27:15] mental
[1:27:17] picture but God cannot
[1:27:20] choose because he knows the beginning
[1:27:22] from the end
[1:27:24] so when you were chosen in
[1:27:26] him there was nothing to choose from but
[1:27:33] himself there was only
[1:27:38] god there was nothing but
[1:27:41] Elohim and you were
[1:27:43] chosen so when God chose you he chose
[1:27:47] himself
[1:27:49] hallelujah amen that means when you show
[1:27:53] up
[1:27:55] God shows
[1:27:56] up when you've been born
[1:27:58] again it's God of the
[1:28:02] audience right from the
[1:28:04] beginning God had a thing in his mind
[1:28:07] that he wanted to
[1:28:09] achieve and the prophet said when God
[1:28:12] thought of you remember God can't have
[1:28:15] thoughts God's too great to have
[1:28:18] thoughts thought are higher than
[1:28:21] our so we use words to try to Des
[1:28:25] something but when God thought of you
[1:28:29] brother Bram said he thought of himself
[1:28:31] being
[1:28:34] Tang God
[1:28:37] tangible the god of the
[1:28:39] audience and now God is showing a part
[1:28:42] of
[1:28:44] himself this is the collective
[1:28:47] personality of
[1:28:50] God this is the side of God that Satan
[1:28:53] has never seen
[1:28:56] before God is too great to be revealed
[1:29:00] in one
[1:29:02] person but we are
[1:29:05] chosen in God when there was nothing
[1:29:08] else but God to
[1:29:11] choose we are the collective personality
[1:29:15] of
[1:29:17] God we are the side of
[1:29:21] God that no one has seen before
[1:29:26] we are the god of the
[1:29:30] audience what Satan has never dreamed
[1:29:37] of that's why you can live a
[1:29:40] life that Satan doesn't know what to do
[1:29:42] with
[1:29:44] you because he's dealing with the word
[1:29:49] again this is the god of the
[1:29:52] audience the colle personality of
[1:29:58] God can you say
[1:30:01] Amen now the shadows of a previous
[1:30:06] Revival you always dance before the door
[1:30:10] of the current
[1:30:15] Revelation I said the shadows of a
[1:30:18] previous Revival
[1:30:24] mockingly
[1:30:26] dance before the door of the open
[1:30:32] Revelation this goes beyond the baptism
[1:30:34] of the Holy
[1:30:36] Ghost brother Ram said justification
[1:30:39] made a way for
[1:30:43] sanctification he said sanctification
[1:30:45] made a way for the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:48] Ghost and the prophet said the baptism
[1:30:51] of the Holy
[1:30:52] Ghost made a way for the person of the
[1:30:55] Holy
[1:30:58] Ghost and you are the
[1:31:01] person you are the person you're not a
[1:31:05] Doctrine you're not a good
[1:31:08] idea you are the person of the Holy
[1:31:11] Ghost we are the collective
[1:31:15] personality of Jehovah God we are the
[1:31:18] side of
[1:31:19] God that no one has seen before
[1:31:24] this goes beyond
[1:31:26] Pentecost this goes beyond
[1:31:28] church this goes beyond
[1:31:31] religion this goes back to
[1:31:34] God God wants to be the god of the
[1:31:38] audience and here we are here we
[1:31:42] are that's why God sent a
[1:31:45] prophet not to make us
[1:31:48] religious not to form another
[1:31:51] organization but to identify
[1:31:55] who we are
[1:31:57] in
[1:31:59] Christ the collective personality of
[1:32:05] God Amen so we don't want to trip up
[1:32:08] over things that are behind
[1:32:12] us sir justification is behind
[1:32:15] us we thank God for
[1:32:18] justification believe
[1:32:20] justification and we move forward
[1:32:24] sanctification and we believe in
[1:32:26] sanctification a must that be sanc
[1:32:29] without Holiness you'll know why is no
[1:32:33] God and we thank God for the baptism of
[1:32:35] the Holy
[1:32:36] Ghost but now is the age of
[1:32:40] adoption it's not here ye
[1:32:44] God it's not here ye
[1:32:49] God now it's hear ye him
[1:33:00] we
[1:33:00] are collective
[1:33:03] personality the
[1:33:05] collective personality of one
[1:33:10] God ye
[1:33:12] him the age of
[1:33:18] adoption so we don't want to trip up
[1:33:21] over things that are behind us
[1:33:25] we want to move forward in the Holy
[1:33:27] Ghost brother Bram said that's the word
[1:33:31] made flesh in human
[1:33:35] being brother Bram said the Holy Ghost
[1:33:40] living his
[1:33:45] life in human
[1:33:47] beings not just the prophets thank God
[1:33:51] for the
[1:33:52] prophets thank God for the the
[1:33:54] message but it's not about the
[1:33:57] prophet it's not about the message it's
[1:34:00] about
[1:34:02] you God sent you
[1:34:05] Elijah God sent you
[1:34:08] Elijah God sent you a
[1:34:11] message because it's all about the God
[1:34:13] of the
[1:34:16] audience chosen in him when there was
[1:34:20] nothing else to choose
[1:34:22] from so when God chose
[1:34:25] you he chose
[1:34:27] himself and here we are the collective
[1:34:34] personality Amen brother said God Jesus
[1:34:39] said will be
[1:34:42] manifested otherwise in the last days in
[1:34:46] human
[1:34:50] beings God will be manifested in human
[1:34:56] when God thought of
[1:34:58] you he thought of
[1:35:01] himself being
[1:35:06] tangible the prophet said now may they
[1:35:09] see the revelation of
[1:35:12] God in human
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:16] beings the revelation of God in
[1:35:21] human amen
[1:35:23] okay if I un can I unload amen God the
[1:35:29] revelation of
[1:35:31] God
[1:35:32] manifest in the human
[1:35:34] beings God
[1:35:37] manifest manifesting
[1:35:40] himself the part of himself that was
[1:35:43] from the
[1:35:44] beginning because we are not
[1:35:47] forgiven we are
[1:35:50] redeemed amen and if we are
[1:35:54] redeemed we have gone back to where we
[1:35:57] came from and God is without
[1:36:02] sin brother said you are never
[1:36:07] lost you just came with

[1:37:38] behind we've been made Kings and
[1:37:41] Priests this message of the
[1:37:44] hour can only be
[1:37:47] understood the prophet said by a
[1:37:50] prophetic class of people
[1:37:58] that means the word come to you
[1:38:02] Pentecost rejects it but the word comes
[1:38:05] to
[1:38:06] you why because you're a
[1:38:09] prophet it can only be
[1:38:12] understood by a prophetic class of
[1:38:16] people the prophet
[1:38:18] said she has she has th say
[1:38:27] so you're a
[1:38:32] prophet so you're a prophet a priest and
[1:38:37] a king that friend is
[1:38:45] Mallu Adam was a prophet a priest a king
[1:38:52] King David was a prophet a priest and a
[1:38:56] king
[1:38:58] amen amen Jesus was a prophet a priest
[1:39:03] and a king St Paul was a prophet a
[1:39:08] priest and a King William brandham was a
[1:39:12] prophet a priest and a king you are
[1:39:16] Prophet a priest and a king this is God
[1:39:21] the god of the audience want to be
[1:39:27] hallelujah hallelujah the prophet said
[1:39:31] the son of
[1:39:32] man will be
[1:39:35] revealed in a body of
[1:39:37] Flesh you people the
[1:39:41] church the prophet said Christ coming to
[1:39:45] his
[1:39:46] body that don't mean just
[1:39:50] me I'm not the body
[1:39:54] I'm a member of the
[1:39:56] body so this is
[1:40:00] Christ coming to the
[1:40:02] body this is the you part of
[1:40:05] God this is the you from the
[1:40:09] beginning this is you a part of the
[1:40:12] personality of
[1:40:14] God and together we make up the
[1:40:19] collective personality of God
[1:40:24] this is what Satan has never seen
[1:40:29] before huj in the beginning when Satan
[1:40:33] was cast out of Heaven he was cast out
[1:40:36] with
[1:40:37] Fury he was cast out into
[1:40:40] darkness and then when he met
[1:40:43] Messiah he said hey this cannot be this
[1:40:46] cannot be Jehovah this cannot be the
[1:40:49] word by cuz I know how God dealt with me
[1:40:54] and brother Bram said the devil anointed
[1:40:57] a Roman
[1:40:59] soldier to pull his beard
[1:41:02] out he said now we will see him
[1:41:05] react now we will see whether he's God
[1:41:08] or
[1:41:09] not and he pulled a whole chunk of beard
[1:41:11] out of Jesus
[1:41:14] face and out came the Flesh and the
[1:41:17] muscle and he said Jesus said father
[1:41:21] forgive them andil
[1:41:23] yes now I know this is not
[1:41:29] God cuz he had never seen that side of
[1:41:32] God
[1:41:35] before Satan will always trip up over
[1:41:38] things that are
[1:41:41] behind but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:41:44] goes on and on and
[1:41:46] on we're not tripping up over things
[1:41:49] that are behind
[1:41:50] us and now the devil looks at you
[1:41:54] and he says I know their faults I know
[1:41:56] their weaknesses this cannot be
[1:42:02] God because when Jesus rose from the
[1:42:05] dead he said okay I should have seen
[1:42:08] that
[1:42:09] one he was a man with no
[1:42:12] mistakes so so now what we do when the
[1:42:15] body Comes The Devil says keep an eye
[1:42:19] out for people that don't make mistakes
[1:42:28] this is the side of God that the devil
[1:42:32] has never seen
[1:42:38] before amen you see grace needs a
[1:42:44] partner and the grace the partner that
[1:42:48] Grace has is called purpose
[1:42:53] so Grace and purpose have a symbiotic
[1:42:57] relationship have you ever seen
[1:42:58] hippopotamus with its mouth wide
[1:43:01] open a
[1:43:06] hippopotamus and sitting on the tooth
[1:43:08] will be a little
[1:43:11] bird and the bird's pecking on the tooth
[1:43:15] of at any time the hippopotamus can get
[1:43:21] crunched but they have a symbiotic
[1:43:26] relationship the hippopotamus is getting
[1:43:28] its teeth
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:33] cleaned and the little bird is getting
[1:43:35] something to
[1:43:37] eat they work
[1:43:39] together it's got a symbiotic
[1:43:43] relationship and Grace and purpose have
[1:43:45] a symbiotic
[1:43:47] relationship amen if I have a
[1:43:51] purpose if my purpose is to manifest
[1:43:53] Jesus Christ
[1:43:55] again then I need
[1:43:58] Grace I need great
[1:44:01] grace and if Grace is going to be
[1:44:05] gracious it needs something to point
[1:44:09] it Grace Grace
[1:44:11] needs
[1:44:13] faults to be
[1:44:15] gracious without your faults without
[1:44:18] your
[1:44:19] failings Grace sits on the Shelf
[1:44:23] and abides
[1:44:25] alone the grace and purpose have a
[1:44:29] combined
[1:44:31] relationship so that the program of
[1:44:33] God keep
[1:44:35] moving this is what the devil has never
[1:44:43] seen and here we are so your faults
[1:44:47] don't Define
[1:44:49] you your faults do not define you
[1:44:54] and what and what you're good
[1:44:56] at does not define
[1:44:58] you the word defines
[1:45:02] you and the word wants to be flesh
[1:45:06] again this is an unconditional
[1:45:09] Covenant your goodness your goodness it
[1:45:12] never brought
[1:45:13] it and your Badness will never dissolve
[1:45:17] it
[1:45:20] it's and it can never fail
[1:45:24] so that the collective personality of
[1:45:28] God be manifested back on
[1:45:31] Earth with all its faults and all its
[1:45:36] failings God can be the god of the
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:44] way praise the
[1:45:46] Lord so with those few
[1:45:49] words I'm going to start my sermon
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:53] [Applause]
[1:46:01] Hebrews 111
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:07] faith is yesterday is
[1:46:11] yesterday don't trip up over things that
[1:46:13] are
[1:46:15] yesterday don't trip up over things that
[1:46:17] are behind
[1:46:20] you amen can you say
[1:46:24] amen
[1:46:26] amen
[1:46:28] Eagles Eagles don't have to think before
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:36] flying flight is
[1:46:42] instinctive you've probably
[1:46:45] noticed Eagles don't wear parachutes
[1:46:57] Eagles are not intimidated by other
[1:47:03] Birds Eagles have an instinct to
[1:47:09] fly can you say
[1:47:12] Amen
[1:47:14] eagles eat
[1:47:16] together but they fly alone
[1:47:23] and
[1:47:24] Eagles are not scared of
[1:47:31] altitude brother Bram said never fear
[1:47:39] failure and he said the prophet said
[1:47:44] Don't Fear
[1:47:47] fanaticism yes sir we're not adding to
[1:47:51] we're not adding to
[1:47:54] we're not taking away we're doing what
[1:47:56] Eagles
[1:47:58] do eagles
[1:48:01] explore and Eagles are not intimidated
[1:48:04] by other
[1:48:06] eag
[1:48:09] amen
[1:48:10] faith faith is a wonderful
[1:48:13] thing faith is the substance of things
[1:48:17] hopeful and you get that faith when
[1:48:19] you're born again
[1:48:22] that faith for 2000
[1:48:25] years and still no
[1:48:29] Rapture Faith lays within the
[1:48:33] subconscious Faith does not lie in the
[1:48:42] conscience when Mary and Elizabeth
[1:48:46] met and Elizabeth was pregnant with with
[1:48:51] John John was dead
[1:48:54] but the first time he heard the name of
[1:48:57] Jesus he left a
[1:49:00] life amen if the name of Jesus will do
[1:49:03] that to a dead
[1:49:05] baby what will it do to a
[1:49:10] church amen Jesus is not one
[1:49:14] person the whole family is called
[1:49:17] Jesus
[1:49:21] Jesus amen
[1:49:23] the thought is Jesus the Loos is Jesus
[1:49:27] Jehovah is Jesus Jesus of Nazareth was
[1:49:31] Jesus but you're the god of the
[1:49:34] audience and the whole family in Heaven
[1:49:37] and Earth it's called
[1:49:39] Jesus so your Prophet a priest and a
[1:49:44] king like unto
[1:49:47] Jesus because brother Bram said Jesus
[1:49:51] was the
[1:49:54] mower M was prophet priest and King
[1:50:01] Jesus was prophet priest and King the
[1:50:06] prophet is Prophet priest and king you
[1:50:10] are you've got to believe it with with a
[1:50:14] Hebrews 11
[1:50:16] Faith Prophet priest and King and once
[1:50:21] you believe it
[1:50:23] you can move
[1:50:24] on a higher
[1:50:27] Faith are you listening to me are you
[1:50:30] listening to me you can move on to a
[1:50:32] faith that brother said God has just
[1:50:35] recently
[1:50:38] created it's called perfect
[1:50:40] faith and that Faith needs no
[1:50:46] faith I I'm here to tell you this is
[1:50:49] where I want to be right now this
[1:50:51] morning I'm here in your
[1:50:53] country tell you in you somewhere is a
[1:50:59] faith that needs no
[1:51:04] faith I'll
[1:51:08] exp if you don't understand
[1:51:11] it you can have faith but as soon as you
[1:51:15] understand it you can't have
[1:51:18] Fai a perfect word as come a perfect
[1:51:22] word
[1:51:23] there is a faith that has an
[1:51:26] understanding said this
[1:51:28] Faith perfect faith has a perfect
[1:51:32] Revelation that this faith is not
[1:51:35] Hebrews 11 Faith you had to have you had
[1:51:38] to have a Hebrews 111
[1:51:40] Faith it's a substance of things
[1:51:44] hopeful but what you hoped
[1:51:46] for is
[1:51:48] here amen
[1:51:51] [Applause]
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:07] am when Mary said to Elizabeth or
[1:52:10] Elizabeth yeah when Mary said to
[1:52:13] Elizabeth his name is going to be
[1:52:16] Jesus John
[1:52:19] left because it was in the subconscious
[1:52:24] but when John was
[1:52:26] born and he grew up and he became a man
[1:52:30] and he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:52:32] God it takes away the sins of the
[1:52:35] world he said behold he knew what he was
[1:52:38] talking about Behold the Lamb of God
[1:52:42] takes away the sins of the world and
[1:52:44] then several years
[1:52:46] later he's in
[1:52:48] jail and he
[1:52:51] says go
[1:52:54] is he the one or do we wait for John did
[1:53:00] better in his subc
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:05] conscience he did with his
[1:53:09] conscience that's why don't lean to your
[1:53:11] own
[1:53:15] understanding
[1:53:17] amen because when we start to talk about
[1:53:20] the thought of God
[1:53:23] being
[1:53:23] manifested as a body of
[1:53:26] Believers when we start to talk about
[1:53:28] God becoming
[1:53:30] tangible makes no intellectual
[1:53:35] sense but this
[1:53:37] Faith the prophet said lies in the
[1:53:43] subconscious it lies within the
[1:53:47] subconscious that's why the Bible says
[1:53:50] we know all things
[1:53:54] but you don't cognitively know all
[1:53:56] things you do know all things it's just
[1:54:00] that we don't
[1:54:02] know we know all
[1:54:04] things we've been trying to work it out
[1:54:06] with our
[1:54:07] mind and if you work it out with your
[1:54:09] mind you will trip up over things behind
[1:54:19] you don't forget you were chosen in him
[1:54:21] to where
[1:54:24] when there was
[1:54:25] nothing nothing to choose from but
[1:54:30] God that
[1:54:32] Revelation lays in the
[1:54:35] subconscious when Jesus rose from the
[1:54:38] dead the Bible says he appeared in
[1:54:41] another
[1:54:42] form and he walked with two
[1:54:45] people that had known Jesus of
[1:54:49] Nazareth for three and a half years
[1:54:53] but because now he's in another
[1:54:55] form they didn't recognize
[1:54:58] him and the Bible says the Bible says he
[1:55:03] opened unto
[1:55:04] them their own
[1:55:10] understanding it was in
[1:55:12] them to know who this
[1:55:15] other not
[1:55:18] cognitively it's in you to know who you
[1:55:21] are
[1:55:23] if you lean not to your own
[1:55:27] understanding
[1:55:28] [Applause]
[1:55:32] amen amen the
[1:55:37] Revelation Revelation gives us an
[1:55:42] understanding brother Ram said pray for
[1:55:44] Revelation more than anything
[1:55:49] else and as soon as it's revealed to you
[1:55:54] you cannot have Hebrews 111
[1:56:02] Faith Hebrews 111
[1:56:06] Faith was given to you to
[1:56:10] believe there's a bit of Faith
[1:56:15] coming that's when you talk about
[1:56:16] Rapture
[1:56:19] Fai perfect fath
[1:56:22] Rapture Faith the Church of
[1:56:25] yesterday it got
[1:56:28] nervous they say I hope I can have that
[1:56:34] faith and they're trying to build up
[1:56:36] something that it's not
[1:56:38] there and they're busy working in their
[1:56:41] cognitive
[1:56:42] thinking and they're putting themselves
[1:56:44] further and further and further away
[1:56:46] from the
[1:56:49] TR brother Bram said brother
[1:56:53] said the
[1:56:55] Rapture will be a
[1:57:00] revelation you don't need Hebrews 111
[1:57:04] Faith
[1:57:07] forap but when you know what it
[1:57:10] is brother Bram said then the bride can
[1:57:14] go who holds the key to
[1:57:17] revelation God holds that key it's lying
[1:57:20] in the subconscious
[1:57:23] now the
[1:57:25] subconscious forward to
[1:57:30] theci cannot go back into the
[1:57:32] subconscious let me
[1:57:46] explain so when God reveals to you who
[1:57:49] you
[1:57:50] are if you know who you
[1:57:53] are it does not matter what people say
[1:57:56] you're
[1:57:59] not you don't need
[1:58:02] approval you don't need
[1:58:05] affirmation and the reason for that is
[1:58:08] God told
[1:58:10] you and God told you the prophet said
[1:58:15] that came from
[1:58:16] your from your Theon
[1:58:23] he said when you have a
[1:58:26] revelation your
[1:58:29] the all things you know all
[1:58:32] things and a part of all
[1:58:35] things M
[1:58:38] forward and you grabbed it and now that
[1:58:41] you know that you
[1:58:42] know and when you know that you
[1:58:45] know don't need Hebrews 111
[1:58:49] [Applause]
[1:58:52] thank God for Hebrews
[1:58:55] 111 but don't trip up over things that
[1:58:58] are
[1:58:59] behind because you were chosen in
[1:59:02] him and God is not
[1:59:07] confused about his
[1:59:11] identity I said God is not
[1:59:15] confused about who he is so God sent us
[1:59:20] a prophet
[1:59:22] to let himself
[1:59:24] know who you are the god of the
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:41] audience it's easier than you
[1:59:44] think the Rapture is easier than you
[1:59:49] think have you ever sat there and got
[1:59:51] scared that maybe maybe you'll be left
[1:59:54] behind because you don't have enough
[1:59:57] Faith as a trick of the
[2:00:01] devil when the time is
[2:00:04] right you will hear from
[2:00:12] yourself St
[2:00:15] John he was at the
[2:00:17] cross he was at the foot of the cross
[2:00:23] he saw Jesus
[2:00:25] die he saw Jesus go into the
[2:00:29] tomb and an early Sunday
[2:00:32] morning he
[2:00:34] witnessed an empty
[2:00:37] tomb amen and then John
[2:00:42] fellowed with the resurrected
[2:00:45] Jesus for 40
[2:00:48] days and then on the aisle of pmos
[2:00:52] in chapter
[2:00:54] five John is
[2:00:56] weeping because he missed
[2:01:01] it John was
[2:01:04] there John read the book John had a big
[2:01:09] Bible John went to a good
[2:01:11] church and missed it I said he missed it
[2:01:16] completely he was
[2:01:19] weeping because he thought in his mind
[2:01:23] no one's
[2:01:25] worthy but he's seen an empty
[2:01:29] tomb fellow with the resurrection
[2:01:32] Jesus and missed it he missed
[2:01:36] it so one of the elders came to
[2:01:40] John 24
[2:01:43] Elders they are made up
[2:01:45] of the 12 Patriarchs in the Old
[2:01:49] Testament and the 12 apostles in the new
[2:01:51] test
[2:01:55] John was one of those
[2:02:00] apostles who came to John and
[2:02:04] said John came to
[2:02:07] John John came to
[2:02:13] John who did you hear
[2:02:16] from the prophet said you heard from
[2:02:18] your the
[2:02:23] you came to
[2:02:24] you and said don't
[2:02:26] weep this is the purpose of
[2:02:29] God and if there's a purpose of God then
[2:02:33] there's great grace to
[2:02:37] accompany so the
[2:02:40] fault does not define
[2:02:43] you and your
[2:02:45] strength do not define you it's the word
[2:02:48] that defines
[2:02:50] you one day
[2:02:52] one day you going to come to
[2:02:55] yourself and say it's going home
[2:02:59] time amen amen amen don't weep
[2:03:03] John the lion of the tribe of
[2:03:06] Judah the one you
[2:03:09] missed sitting in church for such a long
[2:03:13] time thinking you're going to miss a
[2:03:15] Rapture don't weep John who told John
[2:03:19] that John told John
[2:03:25] and when God thought of
[2:03:27] you he thought of
[2:03:30] himself be
[2:03:32] tangible so what is your
[2:03:37] theop god from the
[2:03:43] beginning a part of the collective
[2:03:49] personality don't weep John
[2:03:52] it's going to be okay
[2:03:54] John you know all things
[2:03:57] John and while you don't know all
[2:04:00] things then have a Hebrews 111

[2:09:30] believe Hebrews
[2:09:32] 11:1 brother Bram couldn't believe that
[2:09:35] the squirrel had
[2:09:45] appeared this is a higher faith

[2:15:08] church this is not religion this is not
[2:15:11] a Doctrine this is the person of the
[2:15:15] Holy
[2:15:16] Ghost and that Holy Ghost the prophet
[2:15:20] said has been bound for 2,000
[2:15:25] years you cannot bind up
[2:15:29] Jehovah the church the church has been
[2:15:34] ignorant for 2,000

[2:16:06] things you even
[2:16:09] know the
[2:16:11] second of the
[2:16:16] Rapture but God said I reserve that to
[2:16:19] myself
[2:16:21] and he put it in the
[2:16:26] subconscious and he said you can't work
[2:16:28] it out no man knows
[2:16:31] power but when I bring It
[2:16:33] Forward you know and as soon as you know
[2:16:38] you don't need
[2:16:41] Faith you're just going to walk into the
[2:16:43] next
[2:16:45] step the briide goes on and on and on
[2:16:51] hallelujah amen amen so in the
[2:16:56] beginning God said let us make man in
[2:17:00] our
[2:17:02] own what was
[2:17:04] that
[2:17:06] logos
[2:17:08] logos Pillar of
[2:17:11] Fire Adam was
[2:17:16] logos Adam was a pillar of Fire
[2:17:21] Adam was a holy
[2:17:24] ghost Adam was a holy
[2:17:27] spirit because he was made in the image
[2:17:29] of
[2:17:32] God and John said we don't know what we
[2:17:35] shall
[2:17:36] be but when he shall
[2:17:38] appear then we will know what we
[2:17:41] will and
[2:17:43] 1933 the prophet said he appeared what
[2:17:47] appeared Pillar of Fire
[2:17:51] so for 2,000 years I've been ignorant it
[2:17:55] does not yet
[2:17:56] appear what we shall be but when he
[2:18:00] appears then we'll know what we are and
[2:18:03] we can even know as we are
[2:18:06] known so
[2:18:08] 1933 the FY appeared so now I know I'm
[2:18:13] not the body I'm
[2:18:16] logos I'm a pillar of fire son chosen in
[2:18:20] him
[2:18:21] when there was only him to choose
[2:18:24] from and in the rising of the
[2:18:27] sun brother BR said the pillar of fire
[2:18:30] has been waved over the
[2:18:35] people that there's a whole
[2:18:38] crop coming like this
[2:18:41] one there coming a whole
[2:18:43] church of prophet
[2:18:47] priest and King there's a whole church
[2:18:51] it'll say hey hey me me listen to me me
[2:18:57] I didn't know I was me the message came
[2:19:01] I didn't know who I was so there's a
[2:19:03] people
[2:19:04] coming they can look at themselves said
[2:19:07] don't weep don't weep John the lion of
[2:19:11] the tribe of Judah has
[2:19:14] prevailed we have got great
[2:19:17] grace to achieve a great purpose
[2:19:22] and the purpose of
[2:19:24] God the prophet said was to bring forth
[2:19:27] the
[2:19:28] people likened unto
[2:19:32] [Applause]
[2:19:41] himself don't be scared of rep

[2:20:21] the prophet said when she
[2:20:24] knows that's coming from back
[2:20:28] here your
[2:20:30] subconscious
[2:20:33] real when she knows what it
[2:20:36] is he did not say the Rapture will
[2:20:40] come he said the Rapture will
[2:20:43] go you are the
[2:20:46] Rapture everything that you have need of
[2:20:48] is
[2:20:50] every Revelation that you need
[2:20:53] is because the Bible says you know all
[2:20:57] things it's just that we don't know that
[2:21:00] we know all
[2:21:02] things but I want to leave you my
[2:21:05] friends and I ask you please don't be
[2:21:09] scared of
[2:21:12] rapture it's easier then you
[2:21:17] think it'll come to you the prophet said
[2:21:21] it's a
[2:21:23] revelation and when it's revealed to
[2:21:26] you you don't need no
[2:21:29] faith you just
[2:21:31] know you will know that you
[2:21:34] know next

[2:22:12] alone is there anybody here you've been
[2:22:16] fearful of the rapture
[2:22:21] is there anybody here that the devil has
[2:22:23] got the
[2:22:25] advantage and made you
[2:22:27] think there's a chance you could be left
[2:22:32] behind simply because your faith is
[2:22:37] insufficient is there somebody here who
[2:22:40] thought that the Rapture involved
[2:22:42] Hebrews
[2:22:47] 111 and you misunderstood
[2:22:50] it's a lot easier than you
[2:22:53] think you would like to be prayed
[2:22:56] for Lord reveal it to me open unto me my
[2:23:01] own
[2:23:02] understanding that I am the
[2:23:06] Rapture if you like to be prayed

[2:51:26] amen you know you can seat or stand
[2:51:28] whatever you
[2:51:31] want from the message the seed shall not
[2:51:33] be as the brother plays slowly a little
[2:51:36] bit the seed shall not be here with a
[2:51:41] shark listen to this a prophet says that
[2:51:45] man
[2:51:46] fell like the seed has to fall
[2:51:50] and then God be to brood over
[2:51:54] that after the
[2:51:56] fall he brought up a
[2:51:59] Enoch he brought up a Elijah he brought
[2:52:02] up a Moses he brought up a prophet after
[2:52:06] after Prophet trying to restore that
[2:52:09] image
[2:52:12] again and finally upon the Earth came
[2:52:15] that genuine image of God God himself
[2:52:24] again are you
[2:52:26] following which was
[2:52:28] God the logos made
[2:52:33] flesh and dwelt Among Us you believe
[2:52:37] that say
[2:52:38] amen that's that's what Jesus was and
[2:52:41] then he continues on to say now that
[2:52:44] same
[2:52:47] logos has a
[2:52:50] but he has got a
[2:52:54] bride and that same
[2:52:57] L this word that cannot be tempered
[2:53:03] with is brooding over the churches
[2:53:08] today trying to bring back the word to
[2:53:12] its full manifestation
[2:53:19] which the prophets was carriers to that
[2:53:22] se they were carriers yes and the church
[2:53:26] denominations has been carriers to that
[2:53:28] seed
[2:53:31] now now notice
[2:53:33] quickly but like the shark
[2:53:37] hugs holds in the seed
[2:53:41] now then it leaves
[2:53:45] her the seed shall not be here with a sh
[2:53:51] and because we are
[2:53:52] seed we are a part of the
[2:53:57] logos you know when I was hearing
[2:53:59] Brother Gary
[2:54:02] preach I would say you know someone if
[2:54:04] someone doesn't believe you would say
[2:54:06] that is a hard
[2:54:09] saying and maybe some of you it was over
[2:54:12] the top of your
[2:54:15] head that's a hard saying
[2:54:18] how many receive the
[2:54:20] Revelation by the way if you receive
[2:54:22] this
[2:54:23] Revelation you walk
[2:54:26] free you don't walk
[2:54:29] like oh now I may miss the
[2:54:32] Rapture it's not because of you your
[2:54:36] works or your faith
[2:54:39] even isn't it what I've been preaching
[2:54:44] here I've been preaching the same thing
[2:54:48] by the faith of the Son of
[2:54:51] God and that is a
[2:54:54] revelation you receive it by
[2:54:58] Revelation and the other part of the
[2:55:00] person of Jesus
[2:55:04] Christ I told Brother team I i' never
[2:55:07] seen it that
[2:55:10] way I want to challenge you go back and
[2:55:12] listen to
[2:55:15] that it is the rising of the Sun
[2:55:19] the prophet says and as he being the
[2:55:24] groom he talking about Christ the bride
[2:55:27] has to come
[2:55:29] forth because it's a part of
[2:55:32] him and it can only be the manifestation
[2:55:35] of the fulfilling of all the
[2:55:41] revelations any others have spoken about
[2:55:44] the
[2:55:46] bride it can only man
[2:55:50] if it can only
[2:55:55] manifest if it does something different
[2:55:57] from the
[2:55:58] [Music]
[2:56:00] groom are you the
[2:56:03] bright if your life is different from
[2:56:06] the life of the
[2:56:08] groom your works are different from the
[2:56:12] works of the
[2:56:13] group then he says it isn't the bright
[2:56:20] it can only
[2:56:22] manifest
[2:56:24] because
[2:56:26] amen she is the Flesh of his
[2:56:30] flesh born of his
[2:56:32] born life of his life power of his
[2:56:38] power see is
[2:56:44] him is there someone here tonight amen
[2:56:47] this morning swimming in this Revelation
[2:56:50] today she is
[2:56:53] him as a man and a woman are
[2:56:57] one woman taken from his
[2:57:01] side she had taken a spirit the femin
[2:57:07] spirit the flesh from his
[2:57:09] side made both mechanics and
[2:57:13] Dynamics the spirit of him and the Flesh
[2:57:17] of him and put it together and made
[2:57:20] mechanics and Dynamics and I believe we
[2:57:24] are the
