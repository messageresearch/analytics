the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come and anoint your word Lord take this word Lord and help somebody Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen yeah let us turn to our Bible I have something that I wanted to share tonight that's why I was singing that song of Victory amen because Jesus gave us Victory um I want us to read scripture in okay I have some several of them but let us first read uh in the book of 1 Samuel then we shall read another other scriptures reading 1 Samuel chapter 17: 50 First Samuel chapter 17 uh vers 50 to 53 uh so David Prevail prevailed over Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smot the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hands of David there David ran and stood up up and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and Drew it out of his uh sheet thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith and when the Philistines saw their Champion was dead they fled and the men of Israel and Judah Rose and shouted and pursued the Philistine until Thou come to the valley and to the gates of erron and and the wounded and the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to shim even with G and unto Eon Precious Jesus we thank you Lord for the portion of the scripture we have read and other scriptures we have to read yet we ask you that you bless it in Jesus name amen you may have your seat blessed be the name of the Lord yeah tonight I want us to talk about Goliath amen and uh I call my simple sharing destroying Goliath in our lives blessed be the name of the Lord all Bible reader we know about who Goliath was and also we know of the David and remember in this very scripture Goliath was a Philistine amen and the Israel they were uh they are going they going the war and then there was a giant man called Goliath blessed be the name of the Lord so during that time Israel they had uh they were battling with the Philistine and that battle you realize that uh even today the battle is still raging blessed be the name of the Lord but in this we are seeing here that uh if I start with this quote the prophet say that the spirit of Goliath represent big enemies and giant problems amen if you are currently battling with a situation or an entity that is threatening your peace harassing you and intimidating you you are facing Goliath and if there is a situation or entity that is seeking to enslave you you are facing Goliath blessed be the name of the Lord but I'm here to tell you this evening that uh we have God Amen who is mighty in battle we have God who fights our battle blessed be the name of the Lord and each time you should not forget that every time there is a Goliath you just know that there is a David somewhere blessed be the name of the Lord when you see goliaths in your life you're seeing uh situation things you're going through in your life maybe hard times you are facing you just know within yourself amen within you there is a David samare who will have to face that Goliath blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen and when we come back to this scripture uh we are seeing that uh uh there is a part that I want us to read uh and David was this is uh first Samuel chapter 17 okay we can begin from four it says and there went out a champion out of a c of fisan named Goliath of GTH whose height was six chit and a and a span and he had an element of brass upon his head and was armed with a coat of male and the weight of the coat was 5,000 shackles of brass blessed be the name of the Lord and he had a he had a g he had a grief of brass upon his leg legs and a target of brass between his shoulder and the staff of the spear was like a wavers beam and his Spear's head weighed 600 shekles of iron and one bearing a shield went before him amen and he stood and cried the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in aray and not I Philistine and you servant to Saul choose you a man for you and let him come to me and if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then we will be your servant but if I Prevail against him and kill him then you shall be our servants and serve us blessed be the name of of the Lord and the phis said I defy the armies of uh of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together and when Saul and all Israel heard those words of philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid blessed be the name of the Lord so this man came out and challenged them because according to him being that was Champion he was Warrior from his birth he knew that nobody in Israel would challenge him blessed be the name of the Lord but that is the mistake which the devil always make when he looks at the way you are the way God designed you he looks at your weakness he thinks he can finish you blessed with the name of the Lord but God always has a secret blessed be the name of the Lord for the Bible tells us uh the message tells us uh that uh God that is perfect strength in perfect weakness blessed be the name of the Lord and the David was okay and uh 12 says and now David was the son of the eph of uh Bethlehem Bethlehem Judah whose name was Jesse and had eight sons and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul and the three Elder son of Jesse went out followed Saul to the battle out jump and David was the youngest 16 says and the fisan draw drew near morning and evening and presented himself 40 days and Jesus said unto his son take now for thy Brethren an e of the patched Conn and these 10 Loaves and run to the camp to thy Breen and carry these 10 chees unto the captain of their thousands and look how thy Brethren are faing on aair and take their pledges now Saul and now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Ella fighting with the Philistine and every rose up in the morning and left the ship with a keeper and took and went as Jesse had commanded him and he came to the trench as uh as the host was going forth to fight and shouted for the and shouted for the battle for Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in Array Army against Army and deid left his courage in the hand of The Keeper of the courage and ran into the army and came and saluted his Brethren and as he talked with them behold there came up a champion the philis of goth Goliath by the name out of the armies of philis and spake according to the same word and David heard them blessed be the name of the Lord destroying goath in our lives praise be to God there are things in our lives that we Must Destroy them amen because God has given us everything in this time that we living in right from the first church age through all the generation God has equipped his church with his word blessed be the name of the Lord and the strength of the church lies in the word of God and as long as the church follows the word of God the church win or will win every battle blessed be the name of the Lord remember the story of Israelite that to begin with God had rejected Soul amen because God's intention was to lead the church remember Israel represented represents the church and God was to lead the church but the church reached somewhere down the road and they started fashioning after the world they started admiring the foreign tribes amen other people the way they are and that same mistake today the church is making the same mistake and we are seeing this from uh look at like the Pentecostal world where they have to go in the world and borrow what they do in the world and bring them to the church blessed be the name of the Lord and here we are seeing Israelites they were fighting the battle and regardless of the battle they were fighting God was supposed to be the one fighting their battles blessed be the name of the Lord and that quote which I read braam tells us that the spirit of Goliath represent big enemies all of us we have enemies in our lives because the prophet tells us the greatest enemy of yourself is yourself amen I'm my greatest enemy and if I can overcome myself then there's no enemy that can stand before you blessed be the name of the Lord and the spirit of go represent that big enemies and giant problems and if you are currently battling with a situation I know each one of us we are battling the situation in our lives but I'm here to tell you that we must overcome those goliaths in our lives because God has given us his word amen it is God fighting our battles and no matter what comes our way there is nothing that can take us away from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus amen there is no way we can go back there is no way we can backslide there's no way we can fall blessed be the name of the Lord there is no way we can be defeated amen if you read with me Romans chapter 8 vers 39 let us go there very fast Romans chapter 8 all right let us begin from 35 it says who shall separate us from the love of Christ that's what this Bible tells us tells me who shall is that that's how it is right okay who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or PRS or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as a sheep for a Slaughter n in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels not of principalities not of powers no of things present not of things to come not of height not of depth not any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen you see there is nothing that can put us down Apostle Paul has mentioned almost everything lack death persecution amen and then he made a conclusion and say there is nothing that can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord what we have to know that in this battle we are fighting in this life we are living we are not alone blessed be the name of the Lord we are walking with God whatever we are doing we are walking with with God Amen praise be to God so whichever things that comes our way God permits it and God sees it amen so we are seeing here back to uh our scripture that Israel they are fighting and the greatest challenge they had not all the Philistine the Philistine had a champion and that man was Goliath he was like War Machine he was like a monster amen until even the king of Israelite was scared because remember the Bible tells us that that Saul this man his shoulders was high amen but the other they had a monster amen and it was the one leading their army blessed be the name of the Lord amen so we have many things in our lives we have a lot of hindrances within us sometime even like in overnight you feel like going and something tells you there are some who have not come not because they are sick not because they are bad love but because simply something told them that don't go and they felt like not coming and they stayed at home blessed be the name of the Lord but the prophet said that when the Holy Ghost is in your heart you can't wait for those doors to open amen and David that's why David cried and said that God restore unto me the joy of my salvation when the joy of Salvation is in your heart brother sister amen you will hardly do in the service like this it is that joy that keeps us moving and that's what the devil fight most amen what keeps the Christian moving on it is the joy of Salvation that's what keeps your heart burning amen and when we sing and say that that it is burning within my heart we mean that Joy amen and that Joy is the Holy Ghost In Your Heart blessed be the name of the Lord the Holy Ghost will not take you to Bar he will not take you to the bar in the evening like this he will take you to the church amen the Holy Ghost will not take you to Gumble no sir he will not lead you to see wrong things blessed be the name of the Lord but he will guide you to see the right thing or to read the right stuffs blessed be the name of the Lord the holy spirit always will feed on the word of God praise be to God but many times you find that a week elaps the whole week when you have not been read one verse in your Bible what is the problem or where is the problem it is because because you have Goliath within yourself amen but I'm here to tell you tonight that we have come to destroy all those Goliath in our lives amen and God want you to destroy your enemy The Prophet tells her that you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you blessed be the name of the Lord so tell your neighbor I'm here to destroy all the Goliath in my life amen we know these things we know what hinders us from reading the word of God you know the time you spend on your phone and you know the time you spent reading the word you know the time you spend in prayer blessed be the name of the Lord and whatever is hindering you from progressing spiritually you just those are Goliath those are the hindrances blessed be the name of the Lord the time the Israel the time they spent in the battle and there was no progress amen every day the Bible says they are there for 40 days just [Applause] imagine until maybe it became normal in their ears every time this guy forward they had to hide blessed be the name of the Lord but that was not the will of God the will of God was for them to win each and every battle amen because it was God fighting their battle blessed be the name of the Lord it is God fighting your battle it's not you fighting your battle many time you fail amen you fail in the battle because you are trying to fight your battles blessed be the name of the Lord for the Bible tells us for 40 days every morning goath comes and asks them have you got somebody who can face me we don't need you don't need to we have already killed enough it's like we have already killed enough we have already slayed enough amen just get one man who can challenge me if he challenge me and you winers will'll become your servant if we I challenge him and put him down we will be your servants amen blessed be the name of the Lord and go thought that was a fair game amen praise the Lord Isaiah 59:9 says that so shall uh so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood then the spirit of God shall raise in a standard amen always God raise a standard because he want his name to be feared when the spirit when the enemy comes in like the flood God has always raised a standard if you read your Bible throughout your Bible you find each time the enemy rise like a flood each time you think that there is no solution amen that's when God has a solution for your problem blessed be the name of the Lord and if you look at this thing by the by your physical eyes that's when you complain like Gideon you say that God I'm just nobody but God say you mighty man of Valor blessed be the name of the Lord because God knew that was time for him to raise a standard praise be to God but in this day there are there's a lot of things happening around there's a lot of theology uh there's what the prophet used to call mental telepathy amen we are faced with a lot of challenges in our generation we are faced with a lot of problems amen we are living in the time where science versus Faith amen Faith tells you this science tells you the other things blessed be the name of the Lord but thanks be to God that we have the word and the Bible tells us in Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday is the same today and forever the same mechanism he used to overcome the devil from the first day is still the same tactics and it will be still the same tactics blessed be the name of the Lord Lord amen butam say that we need today what we need today is the Life of Christ inside of us and that is what pufies not the outward but turned around color or degree of psychology or something it takes the power of resurrected Christ to make us what we should be amen and God has no no other plan than let the Holy Spirit Rule and reign in the church blessed be the name of the Lord the only way we can overcome is by letting the Holy Spirit Rule and reign in you you have to sacrifice yourself amen you have to lay down yourself blessed be the name of the Lord you have Surrender Your Will to God you have surrender your children you have to surrender your knowledge amen and let the Holy Spirit reign in your life blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet say that is the plan of God that's the purpose of God Amen praise the Lord amen you know they ought to be like David the man okay sorry okay let's read this quote First it says that uh so so you my brother and if there is no testing time then you haven't made your investment yet because your enemy is standing there with a hammer back on his gun with a bu string drowned and he is ready to shoot every poison dir that he can send every cult and every little idea and every intellectual giant like Goliath amen he sends them around like that look so taller than the Brethren that you are associating with you are little you you are little ignorant and unlearned Brethren he send such spiritual intellectual Giant and Big schools that can explain the whole thing away from you but you have made your investment and got your policies sted and sealed by the Holy Spirit and there is nothing going to rub it off blessed be the name of the Lord and then of course Saul trained his army so he said Oh my he had them Israel just knowing every which way to knock a spear off or to do anything but one day there came a challenger old Goliath and and brother is taken more than unintellectual training then it took a man that know something about supernatural blessed be the name of the Lord don't think that Israel were not trained they were well trained and in this quam says that they even knew how to Doge a spear how you could throw your spear hey amen and they thought that things would just be like that blessed be the name of the Lord but brother bam tells us that one day there came a challenger that's why you knowing the word is not enough you learning studying the Bible it's good but it's not enough amen because this men were skilled they were well trained in the Army amen they knew how to Doge Spears they knew how to fight they knew how to wrestle blessed be the name of the Lord but one day there came a challenger whom they could not wrestle with amen they needed something spal to engage that enemy blessed be the name of the Lord that's why the prophet tells us that to know him is life not to know words in fact not even to know the message but to know the author of the message to have the Holy Spirit in you to have the author of the word in you that is what make the difference blessed be the name of the Lord and he say that and brother it it taken more than an intellectual training it will take you more than an intellectual training blessed be the name of the Lord when we were in Pentecostal we had the Bible when in our Catholics we still had the Bible and the Evangel uh and we could go for those masses but you could not overcome even the Habit amen blessed be the name of the Lord you could repat those recite those Rosary the whole day every evening and every night and from there you will still even putting on those rosaries you will go and for those like uh who practice witchcraft somebody will bewish you even when he putting on those things because those things they have no power amen it is only the word of God that has power blessed be the name of the Lord amen we knew all those things but all those thing could not help us even when we're in Pentecostal the same thing we had the Bible they used to preach to us but that could not help us blessed be the name of the Lord it was good for them to preach to us brother Solon amen but that could not help us and this men were well trained in fact even just believing the message is not enough attending church is not enough it's good to attend Fellowship because the Bible tells us we should not forsake assembling together of saints but that is not enough you can attend all the services still you go to hell praise be to God God want us to go beyond that God want us to accept him in the power of his resurrection praise the Lord because this men were also soldiers like the other guys they also trained like them but one day there came a challenge which was abnormal amen praise be to God praise be to God goath told David that would Pierce him with his Spear and then carry him and the Falls of hair would fed on him unless in the presence of God you can't even lift your hands for two hours but just try lifting this phone like this for 10 minutes you'll find you're fighting with gravity but this man says that he would Pierce him and carry him up or praise be to God he was abnormal to begin with this man they needed Supernatural power amen and they had it but they lacked the Revelation blessed be the name of the Lord amen and when goath was there raising dust that's when David visited the camp and that day Goliath never knew that something had happened amen that there was a revival going on in the camp of the Israelites blessed be the name of the Lord he thought is as usual because you have been shouting for the last 40 days he comes and shout and goes back comes and shout and goes back but I'm here to tell you amen that your enemies they will not shout at you forever just keep on coming to church keep on feeding on the word one day amen God will open your understanding one day God will give you the revelation of your Victory praise be to God Amen even soul never knew that something was going on in their camp David had visited the Bible tells us he had come to see the father told him go and see how your brethren are faing in the battle praise be to God Amen and the prophet tells us Whenever there is a Goliath there is a David somewhere amen do not look at the goath I'm here to tell you that there is a David somewhere to face that Goliath blessed be the name of the Lord amen and brother bam says here that it took a man that know something that know something about supernatural but God had such a man thank the Lord for that that God even today he has men who knows something about supernatural blessed be the name of the Lord he says you know they ought to be like David the man was after God's Own Heart he say the Lord is always before me wherever he goes and he remember that God is always before him he is on my right hand and I'm not and I will not be moved because God is on my right hand David knew all about God blessed be the name of the Lord and when David was there he was still standing blessed be the name of the Lord David he had slew the bear he had killed the lion amen and when when David saw this man oh blessed be the name of the Lord maybe he developed that feeling because remember it was not David destroying bear and lion but it was the anointing of God upon David amen and when the same situation Rose here that same feeling came back again David started feeling the same and he knew that there was a job to be accomplished blessed be the name of the Lord and he said and said that he said to the men of Israel do you mean to tell me that you will stand and let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies of the Living God I will go fight him oh my a little bit drone over not a looking not a look thing the Bible says he was rude amen we canot continue like this I'm going to face him blessed be the name of the Lord he said I'm going to face him he took a man that know something about spania but God had such man thank the Lord for that God has always got somebody he will always have he had man he called to put his hand on Amen and when Goliath was on the land God had somebody who was willing to stand there must be a willingness to stand you are the deavid today he amen are you willing to stand and face the Goliath of our generation are you willing to stand and face that Goliath in your lives blessed be the name of the Lord are you willing to stand and look your challenges into the ey amen and tell the devil I'm not going to live this way anymore I'm not going to live a defeated life amen because the price was paid everything was paid on the cross of Calvary and Jesus gives us Victory he died and rose again and said because I overcome you will also overcome amen I give you power to tr over serpent you shall Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover you shall cast out demons in your in my name blessed be the name of the Lord amen God is looking for somebody who is willing to stand and now is the time blessed be the name of the Lord what we had the Creeds and the dogmas could not give us Victory we are still living in shame and bondage praise be to God but God Amen rich in his Mercy he sent us the message of the hour showing us that our Victory lies in the word amen and now we have a restored word in of Our Generation blessed be the name of the Lord this people they heard God but they they only lacked experience with God what David had David had his personal experience with God this people they knew the god of our father the god of Abraham said the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob but David had an experience with that God you know that this God is far far beyond just being read in the scroll or being mention in the word what he did to Abraham because one day that God saved him amen when the lion came that God proved to him that I am the god of Abraham and now I am your God blessed be the name of the Lord so David had an experience he knew what he was talking about he knew the god of his father he is still the same God and when he came to the camp and heard Goliath making noise I think even he had headache blessed be the name of the Lord and what David had his brothers did not have because he told them this man to begin is been uncircumcised and do you that you are the army of the Lord and this man is defying the army of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise be to God what was David doing he was laying a strategy how was going to face his enemy this man is a Philistine M this man is uncircumcised he has no Covenant with God there's no way there is no way amen there's no way can defy the arm of the Lord since I have come now and have met that God and I have a personal experience with him now is the time blessed be the name of the Lord God had visited the camp of Israel in David and his brothers were wiing blessed be the name of the Lord and that is the same problem we are having even in the message Church you find other brothers other ministers attacking other ministers what the Same Same Spirit is not dead but we are fighting the common enemy praise be to God David asking question was for them good like that praise be to God but this man had a secret amen he was like Samson David had a secret which even Goliath did not know he thought this is ordinary Dixon brother let us receive the Holy Ghost amen the moment we receive the B of the Holy Ghost we are not commoners anymore but we are amate Gods amen praise be to God the reason I that's why the devil want to Trum on us is because we have not known who we are we have not received the portion of God in us amen and that's why I want to to you blessed be the name of the Lord but that day something had happened praise be to God maybe David was there the Bible says he was a sheep but maybe was there one day and he felt of a feeling in him and he was praying for deliverance he was praying for victory and he didn't know why he was praying amen the Holy Ghost was moving on him and then maybe few days down the road his father called him and told him boy take this to your brothers and when he was going there something was telling him in his heart he had a strange feeling in him praise be to God Amen the Holy Ghost was ministering to him and when he reached there the enemy also rose that morning and came he started blaspheming why do you come with your enemy in church and you go back with him we come with habit and then we go back with the same habit praise be to God am the word of God it is purpose is to destroy the enemy of the word the devil operates in the body or in the human Veil so we should not allow to come with the Enemy and we go back with him let God crush your enemy amen if is a time for you to destroy your Goliath each one of us we know the Goliath we have in our lives others maybe butam say that if you used to pray and you no longer doing it you back lead start with that one if you used to First and nowadays it's so hard for you that is Goliath praise be to God if you used to come early to church and nowadays you you struggle you come late that is Goliath is a time you destroy your enemy blessed be the name of the Lord but in the message INF say that we know that you know we ought to be like David a man after God's Own Heart he said that he that the Lord is always before me and B say that wherever David Goes he remembered the Lord whever we go we should always remember the Lord listen when David got a sling amen and he throw it toward Goliath David knew who he was David knew what goliath was and David also knew what God was or who God was amen he was standing in the right place with the right word and he was facing the right enemy that's why the Bible says whosoever comes before God Must Believe first that he is God is and he reward those who seek of him diligently praise be to God and without faith it is impossible to please him David had faith in God he believed that God was there amen praise be to God God is so concerned about about us I was reading that scripture in Genesis chapter 2 where the Bible says that uh and God say that man should not be alone but abam says that uh the second thing greatest thing that God can give you that God gives you after salvation is our Good Good Wife God from the beginning he say it's not good for you to be alone but most time I was looking at it from another perspective of not just being married like having a sister or having a wife but God's intention for man God has never wanted man to be alone amen God always want to have fellowship with man and if the wife is the greatest second thing or give that God gives you after salvation then talk of the marriage with Christ blessed be the name of the Lord then what is the first greatest gift it is salvation praise the Lord so brethren we are not alone God always works with us and God wanted God had us in his plan praise be to God because even after creating the Angels still go say let us make man how Hallelujah wow I didn't know that he already living David knew who he was he had met God this words have been I've heard it for I think the last 20 years having personal experience with God personal God and we are hearing this again over and over until we get used to it without having personal experience with God but each each and every Christian must have a personal experience with God that is the only way to go men disappoint even great men will disappoint you that's why the singer said that friend when sickness lays you down a friend when time is at last amen Jesus will always be there because he has always been there for you before you were born when you were born the day you were born when you living on this Earth amen and even your last minute that Jesus is the one who will be there and it's always good to know that he is there you must create that relationship with him and that relationship comes through personal experience you could not convinced David that he never killed a lion because David killed a lion with his hands when you meet God no one can divert you from the truth because you met God alone you could not tell Jacob that you were just dreaming he will tell you sir I was not dreaming why he could even he could even take you there where he lled with Angel where did you wrestle with your angel is it in a cinema Hall is it in football pitch you must have an altar somewhere brother sister before the Rapture you must wrestle with an angel blessed be the name of the Lord you realize in the message that in a few places where you find talks about you going to hell somebody going to hell but many times he says that a sinner fight his way to Hell praise be to God God he say that God has not take any man to hell but man takes himself to hell how they will tell you you have a personal experience with God and you take it for granted be on fire for God and for you that's none of your business do this for God and it's like you also see by the time you realize you've reached your your books remember your book the day you were born it was open started writing blessed be the name of the Lord destroying goliaths in our lives in our homes God has given us that Authority whatever we bind on Earth he will bind in heaven [Music] amen praise be to God and when he set that loose the Holy Ghost got a hold of that little old Stone and picked it up at a speed about 1,000 miles per second and strike that giant between the face and he fell forward hallelujah oh my amen the Holy Ghost grabbed that stone because he had the extion with that same Holy Ghost they were afraid with that Holy Ghost amen David was not alone and that's why when he was facing the enemy of Israelites that same Holy Ghost grabbed the stone and brother says the stone ran at 1,000 kilomet per second it was like in a blink of an eye I believe this was like in a blink of an eye praise be to God Amen so coming to church is like so with his uh Spears and armor like and all those so coming to church is it's good but not enough you have to go farther amen we are living in the time where every Christian ow to cry to God there are [Music] people praise be to God what you have to know this body will never obey the word but you'll have to force it to obey you'll have to believe God that my flesh will obey every word of God and I will live above sin not because I'm perfect no but I'm also fighting against this flesh every single day when it speaks against the word I say My Flesh obey praise be to God that's why the Bible say let us lay aside every weight and every sin you can lay it aside it is possible to lay it aside because this says the bible let us lay aside every weight and every sin that was this will beset us after putting it aside let us run amen with patience toward the mark of High Calling The Mark of High Calling is in Christ Jesus and you cannot run there with your sins you have to lay it aside God rejected so he could not win their enemy God had to choose somebody else Amen to come and finish the job and if you're not willing to run let me tell you God will pick somebody else so we sh thing that God puts in our hands to do be it outside there or in the service do it with all your heart because if you don't do it God is going to raise somebody else he going to pick someone else who will accomplish that job and you will be there watching when David told him that I'm going to face the giant he told him you know what okay you come you know okay but what makes you think say okay here is my here is my CV one day I was Ring my father father's sheep the lion came I crash he say huh can you kill a lion just a maybe when the King was still one I'm still another day bear came I crushed it say but okay when you're going to face the giant according to the of War we were told when the spear is thrown toward you you need to have an armor like maybe this blessed be the name of the Lord are you seeing how we are addressing all of us so you need something that can protect you that can Shield you from that and somehow David compromise see and maybe God does not need your help in any battle he's fighting for you what it tells you to believe that the battle is his and let God fight for you he told Israelite hold your peace amen just stand still don't even St and no stand still and see my salvation amen God already had s this word that noon formed against you shall prosper and we a tongue that has risen against you he shall condemn it into judgment and that's is what David Soul amen he needed no help from Soul he told him have your stuff he had Faith the prophet tells us five Stones blessed be the name of the Lord and that's what he used to put down the Giant and the Bible says when Goliath was put down the rest of the enemy took off amen pick one GL in your life behead him and all other demons will flee amen receive the holy ghost in your soul and all other habits will flee blessed be the name of the Lord the giant you having tonight is what is re hindering you from receiving the Life of Christ in you but when he the Holy Ghost is come blessed be the name of the the Lord that is what we need tonight the rest of demons will take off because when they come it will be the Holy Spirit fighting for us where the devil used to come and knock on you D and you open for him this time when he comes another boss will open for him and he will have no words to say blessed be the name of the Lord and that boss is the Lord Jesus Christ so tonight you know the challenges you know what is Turing on your way now is the time destroy everything every altar in your life whatever is not planted by God in your life it is high time for us to bring it down to uproot it amen because we have the word let

Night in the storm twice as horrible as this was out on the Raging Sea and all hopes was gone they thought they would be they thought they would be gone but they remember they had the rock on the board amen if you can only remember that we have the rock on the board amen they spoke to the Rock and The Rock gave forth it is eternal water and it spoke up and the wind and the waves obeyed him the rock is still the same today as he ever was he still got eternal life he still got Eternal peace amen they remember that Jesus was on the boat and the prophet says speak to the Rock speak to Christ he here is in his word amen he St to speak to him praise be to [Music] God there is Honey in the Rock tonight let us leave our sin for the blood to cover if there's time that we have to fight now is the
