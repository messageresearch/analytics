foreign there is power in the blood it is [Applause] [Applause] there is power [Music] in power [Applause] oh hallelujah father we believe there is power in the blood of jesus not even we have just you see these people that are here this morning [Music] i want to greet you all in the name of jesus christ amen so this morning by the grace of god i want to speak on the status of your heart towards possession this morning my name your family over there we're gonna get peter and family children god bless you come on sir uh we're reading from hebrews chapter four together okana [Music] we're reading from for the for for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than energy to edge this word piercing even to the dividing asander of the soul and spirit and the joints and and marrow and is a designer of the thoughts and intents of the heart [Music] of okay where you are and i know this is true that each of us many times have very many needs the body of christ is a needy body oh moving christians [Music] we need not only the spiritual blessings of the world but also the physical blessings that sustain us in this physical life for instance if you did not have anything you know in your pocket probably you wouldn't have clothes if you do not have wisdom probably you may not be able to accomplish your school dream if you do not have money maybe you may not be able to build a house if you want to build the house for your family in a sense so if you do not have enough resources you may not be able to get the needs such as you want in this life and so very many people have resorted to after praying and they thought that god never answered their prayers they have resorted to finding other ways of getting their needs other than god indeed [Music] well of course stealing does not necessarily mean that you go grab something and steer it away but really even according to the scripture in the word of god in malachi chapter three my name is here this morning i mean when this is in the book of malachi chapter 3 verse verses 1. not according to me katichi noticing is it he is saying that a man will indeed drop god again that you can surely be a robot so there are many people according to god according to me catholic and you sincerely understand that and well why do they hope to begin with yes they wrote because they thought because he has plenty um [Music] and so he thinks he's just trying to do justice in kenya how can you have a two houses and he has one oh they wrote them up to phone that he has one already so he thinks he's just trying to do justice you know to the phone so he will just have to take his phone and utilize it so a thief is not entirely a thief because it's bad katya would be simultaneous he's a thief because he's trying to satisfy his needs or the needs of his father presume that because she has more children than you to take care of it and so according to culture they would say well with exception of how well she's going to save production she's stealing kathy [Music] [Applause] [Music] so now the bible says that even christians can rob god [Applause] [Applause] and because what someone else has in this case god has kept it with you so you kind of think well i can use this god will come later but this morning i'm speaking on the status of your heart what's possession of god is promises for you because you think you need more mango the other day someone was asking me a question in our bible study he said faster what if you you you your needs are more than your income what younger and then plan where are you in offerings everywhere where are you now the reason why i'm speaking on this because i feel that the church of christ is in much later in jesus name god sets down his principles in his word catholics in order for us to possess all the blessings he has prepared for us if we get out of those precipitation then we are bound to fail that's why he says you [Music] is that this is the promise of god i personally believe it isn't going unto jesus i read it in my life since 16 years ago [Music] hallelujah amen and you want to ask me did god keep his background oh yeah yeah yes indeed and he says i will rebuke the devourer for your sex and you shall not destroy the fruits of your ground shall be a delightsome land say the lord of hosts and when some people someone asked another question the other day can i say when i i'm i'm speaking what how i've spent my money can i say i've also spent on times i've spent on these and then you mentioned that so how can you now account for what is not yours how can you spend what is not yours you cannot count among your expenditures desire for the offerings from that then you give god everywhere and what you decide to give is what you give yourself why are you two why but god has determined that ten percent is his name hallelujah so that is the word of god and what is the status of your heart towards that word the word of god is quick and energy george singer [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah amen but right now it's our time yes sadly that is true did you realize that people have a behavior that they always want to be involved in things that they may benefit from you know they kind of feel that i cannot be involved in a society or organization or something when i don't benefit anything since [Music] [Applause] [Music] and many times they realize they're not going to and many of them have decided to walk as christians but as double dealers they are christians in the church but mechanism otherwise they will be in the world because many of them are believers because of what of is [Applause] amen even biologically you know the blood of the mama or the mother does not come into the bloodstream of this of the daughters [Applause] [Applause] if those are your [Applause] [Music] [Music] it is true that that is not just used to hearing it without action are you hearing me over here that is always ready to hear something new oh [Music] it is [Applause] many times foreign something which they are ready to possess something which you are ready to possess aching to and the ability to believe that word without doubting or hallelujah again for her name of course that scripture is read many many times on that day in the condition [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] amen amina and i will continue to read these few words i do not complete them every gamble this is all determined by the status of your heart it's only taught me by the students of your heart yes [Applause] [Applause] you believe you can give your wife [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] depression might be a giant as if god has [Applause] [Applause] god is going to expose amen if you are that person this morning [Applause] to your destiny between the promises of god for you for you amen some of you may be business people when is the quantum core business things going wrong getting to be full be some because of coverage your jobs others have lost their jobs what's you they don't even put into consideration that this is god speaking to me on the yeah what is the status of your heart this morning remember no preacher that is sent by god you cannot remove without even knowing who he will talk to [Music] [Applause] if you and we look at the status now today i want to act like a doctor myself a spiritual doctor over so what am i examining chi chi chain camera many christians have failed to receive their breakthrough because [Applause] and we are going to examine a few people that were before us cut it together about amen hallelujah ever let us examine cain's heart what kind how was cain's heart oh my team cain's heart was bad dr peter this morning i'm the doctor and so we're trying to examine people's believe [Music] don't put your prosperity for another day [Music] [Applause] god [Music] jesus came and made me whole i would not [Applause] if jesus came and [Music] one more time i will not be denied i will not be denied since jesus came and made me whole i would not be delighted this service this morning has the potential of pushing away things that have encumbered you for all your past life amen now this morning for the greater part of the service in general i want to for the greater part of the service extremely services i want us to deal with the status of hearts in connection with elijah and elisha and one more no miranda who we all know fenago tomani brother i don't know if i should call him a brother over meteor uganda oh your buddha is here i want us to turn to the book of first kings jagger and it came to pass when arab so elijah that i have said unto him that thou he that trouble with israel and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and our daughters followed balaam now therefore ascend and gather to me all israel and to mount camel and the prophets about 450 and the prophets of the groves 400 which eats at jezebel's table so i have sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel [Laughter] brothers organizing slightest ministry is a ministry to the house here we are for another doctor that the bible promises the coming of elijah and elijah's ministry would be turning their hearts could choose and he shall turn the heart of hearts [Music] he finds he always comes to check the status of the acts how is it [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] a woman that wants to dominate over me a woman that wants to rule over me god doesn't like that spirit the bible says god hates the spirit of desert rightly again hallelujah full submission and your husband is not your partner your husband [Applause] that is why my sister is not right for you to marry an unbeliever because if you man you marry a man who is not ruled by christ christians is oh is [Applause] which head [Applause] like amen amen amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] amen amen we ought to fire the spirit oh god [Applause] themselves [Applause] you find them with mini skirts [Music] [Applause] [Applause] she took herself as if she was hearing from god was not led by god anymore he was controlled by the woman a true man a right man can never be or should never be controlled by the woman sister it is not right for you to control your husband

your wife all of them i want to show them a living god let me tell you my brother and sister no man can contend with the god of elijah because they're going to be like why can't hallelujah [Applause] [Music] how long would you be in two opinions oh should i do this should i correct you know actually correctly obviously maybe i should start a business comment on the key business maybe i should not open it down maybe i should do this you know brother oh god listen to the spirit of god what is the moment if the lord be god for him for him and the people answered him elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord now go you know for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood navigating the committee that is good bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called in the name of baal nevermind ain't even until noon area oh oh [Music] check [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] sleeping [Applause] until the time of the offering of the was broken down not that it is the god of elijah must repair the altar bear the word the foundations of the gospel [Music] amen it's the spirit of christ and elijah took the twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob gomez and you know and unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and and with the stones in the name of the lord and he made a trench about who is that god not you you shouted again again lord jesus christ become our faith christian jesus christ that these people may know that thou art the lord elijah's ministry is to turn the hearts of where is that can you put that on your mouth and say it with me elijah's ministry is to turn the hearts [Music] go to chapter 19 verse one oh [Music] and the people were saying that guarantee whatever i was saying but remember education would you say now as a spiritual doctor i want to go and do a second checkup heart condition has it changed [Music] what here [Music] did you dance [Music] as they try to work on it okay now can you hear us praise the name of the lord so try to be a bit others what god has done but he himself was not changed he went to tell others what was happening again [Applause] [Applause] blessing [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah should i say should i continue fighting elijah wasn't scaring and when someone said dude but what did she do she didn't have to enquire from my husband because you remember the other suramites you had to go to her husband again they were bowed and said should i i said i'm going to the man of god you know she she had to go to the husband yeah again they so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them tomorrow about this time you have killed my men i'm going to kill you tomorrow yes is let us first follow this i had some quotes here but let's skip those for now and let's follow this talk category and see the the status of the heart of galatians elisha was the minor was the one that was following elijah all the time is second kings chapter 2 verse 1. give me the passport and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind but elijah went with elijah from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray for the lord has sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul leave it i will not leave thee so they went down together and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elijah and said unto him i was thou that the lord will take away thy master from my head today and he said yeah i know it hold your peace said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho and the sons of the prophets that where jericho came to elijah and said unto him namaste that the lord will take away thy master from thy air today and he answered yeah i know it hold your pleas sent me to jordan and he said as long as they saw leave it i won't leave v and they too went on command for the greater part of the ministry of elijah whereas god worked with elisha cathedral like he worked with elijah but now as we are transitioning from the ministry of elisha i want you to understand that the ministry of elijah continued in the ministry of elections but you need to see the status of the heart of elisha elisha loved what was in elijah whereas rejected it there was an elisha while they were not willing to trade anything for the ministry that you have seen in their life the sons of the prophet should come and tell him do you know [Applause] yes by the god of this age is still the same god who was there at that time [Applause] when elijah was on the scene god was working in a mighty way [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] that is [Music] camaraderie community he told him when you see me then you shall receive a double position move this hallelujah amen amen [Applause] the only way you can be well is to baptize yourself in water seven times [Music] people have spiritual have trouble and the solution is repent i'm changing oh that is the way in the name of the lord jesus christ before the remission of your sins received you know come on you know islam river let me go now come on yeah [Music] because they say that paul i mean peter was there for support man depending on your purpose but peter is a married man named sir he was a married man and therefore and the first pope he's not married and then and he went and dipped himself and then verse 15 he returned to the man of god originally recognized he and all his companies and he came and stood before him [Applause] he put his arms around know to my home my home in glory i will walk on streets [Music] [Applause] oh yes sir and now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel and now i know there is no god in all the denominations but in the message [Applause] he was a blessing to this man oh my god [Music] said as the lord lives before my eyes okay because he was converted elisha was preaching because his heart was stunned let me go come here and preach to very many people but there are demands not when they come up to open their pockets this is what the nominations have done this is what they have done that's why many of them in this country have even called close the churches and they know they are no longer preaching at all i had somewhere a pastor went came and stole and sold all the chairs saw all the instruments and disappeared oh summer yeah you mario now nobody not do cannabis he went and sold all the chat they said this is a better business better deal let me sell all the chairs and all the instruments i disappear with the commander [Music] the area can say i don't know we will never preach we never serve god will never be christians because you're going to receive something from god we do what we do to correct you we believe what we believe two kids are going to kill you believe this is who we are hallelujah amen right after me if i preached on the ground [Applause] [Applause] a person that this world is not with you oh god let them say that
