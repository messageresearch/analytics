[1:02:46] miss ministry.
[1:02:48] May you be with him, Father. And as I
[1:02:51] stand in the gap for him, Father, I
[1:02:54] pray, dear, Lord Jesus, that you may
[1:02:56] give me grace, Lord, to rally behind the
[1:02:59] vision
[1:03:01] that you've given to the man of God. And
[1:03:03] as I put my hands on the wheel,
[1:03:07] push this cut a little farther.
[1:03:09] May all the glory and honor go back unto
[1:03:13] thee. For this we pray
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; You can take your seats for a moment.
[1:03:25] Indeed, what a manner of man is Jesus.
[1:03:29] That is a question this morning.
[1:03:32] And I believe you have the answer.
[1:03:35] What has he done for you? What he has
[1:03:38] done for you? That is the kind of man
[1:03:41] that he
[1:03:43] praise the name of the Lord Jesus. I
[1:03:46] greet you all once again.
[1:03:49] In the lovely and precious name of our
[1:03:50] Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:03:53] thanking God for yet another opportunity
[1:03:57] to be standing before you.
[1:04:00] I'm happy to see you.
[1:04:02] Are you happy this morning?
[1:04:05] We thank God. He has been gracious
[1:04:08] indeed.
[1:04:10] uh down in Kenya, we are still fighting
[1:04:12] the good fight of faith
[1:04:16] and we know we have overcome
[1:04:19] regardless of how the devil fights.
[1:04:22] When sickness comes, we are more than
[1:04:24] conquerors
[1:04:32] to our precious brother.
[1:04:34] No, it is just a battle.
[1:04:37] But I have overcome.
[1:04:39] So do not be afraid.
[1:04:42] Do not look at the hands and start
[1:04:44] feeling sorry for me.
[1:04:47] I didn't come for your pity.
[1:04:50] I came to lift up the name of God.
[1:04:53] So let us not focus on other things.
[1:04:56] We are here for the word.
[1:04:58] And you know I just want to appreciate
[1:05:00] the pastor in absentia
[1:05:03] for this opportunity to stand before
[1:05:04] you.
[1:05:06] And I also want to appreciate you as
[1:05:08] well
[1:05:09] for the love. I believe if you also
[1:05:12] didn't want me to come
[1:05:15] I wouldn't have made it here. You would
[1:05:18] have told your pastor
[1:05:20] pastor never invite that young man
[1:05:21] again.
[1:05:24] And I believe your pastor
[1:05:27] would have listened.
[1:05:29] Praise the name of the Lord Jesus. But
[1:05:31] to show that I've come again,
[1:05:34] I believe it's your prayers.
[1:05:36] And here we are. Are you prayed up for
[1:05:39] the service?
[1:05:42] We appreciate all the men of God,
[1:05:45] the church officers,
[1:05:47] the trustees and the deacons,
[1:05:49] you know, all of them standing at their
[1:05:51] post of duty.
[1:05:53] You know, as I was saying, mine is just
[1:05:55] to come put my hands
[1:05:58] and you know, and push this wheel a
[1:05:59] little bit further
[1:06:02] just to come and support the ministry
[1:06:03] that you do.
[1:06:05] I follow your services
[1:06:08] and indeed you have very wonderful men
[1:06:10] of God
[1:06:12] that labor to feed you spiritual good in
[1:06:14] due season.
[1:06:17] And you know, I'm just here to just, you
[1:06:19] know, go on, brother. Keep on, keep on
[1:06:23] just to come and support.
[1:06:26] I received greetings from back home.
[1:06:30] Uh brethren from church sent me with
[1:06:31] greetings.
[1:06:33] Few that knew I was coming this way.
[1:06:37] Brother Paulo,
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; brother Isaac
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; and so many of them and they send their
[1:06:44] love.
[1:06:46] My family as well,
[1:06:48] they also send their greetings and I
[1:06:51] believe that you receive them.
[1:06:53] Are you happy?
[1:06:55] Can you now get into business?
[1:06:58] Can we get into the word? Why don't you
[1:07:01] just sing this song?
[1:07:03] I just have a thought that the Lord
[1:07:04] placed in my heart.
[1:07:08] I've I've preached on it back home,
[1:07:11] took a couple of services on it.
[1:07:15] Uh but I trust that God will help me
[1:07:17] today
[1:07:19] to condense all of them
[1:07:22] into one. So if you're expecting
[1:07:25] something,
[1:07:27] I want to tell you in the right place
[1:07:31] because it's going to be power,
[1:07:34] not because of me.
[1:07:36] But because it is the word,
[1:07:39] I can say a million words.
[1:07:42] But one word from the Lord
[1:07:44] will be more than enough.
[1:07:47] And we shall be opening our Bibles.
[1:07:50] You'll have to forgive me today.
[1:07:53] I don't know if some of you know me as a
[1:07:55] lengthy preacher.
[1:07:59] Sorry to disappoint.
[1:08:02] Today we are going to read an entire
[1:08:04] book.
[1:08:09] Okay,
[1:08:11] the amens are very few there.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Today we are going to read an entire
[1:08:16] book.
[1:08:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you for not being Ugandans today.
[1:08:25] Uganda. You know I was told Ugandans are
[1:08:27] like mud.
[1:08:30] When it rains they don't come to church.
[1:08:33] Mad. Mad.
[1:08:38] Because when it rains and they're coming
[1:08:39] to church, they can, you know, they can
[1:08:41] melt.
[1:08:44] That is what I was told about Ugandans.
[1:08:46] I don't know how true it is.
[1:08:51] But I'm just saying thank you for not
[1:08:52] being Uganda.
[1:08:55] You are Christians
[1:08:58] and that is why you're in church.
[1:09:01] And we are going to read an entire book
[1:09:03] of the Bible.
[1:09:07] Brother Shalom, help us sing that song.
[1:09:08] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[1:09:13] I'm going to speak from a slave
[1:09:17] to a son
[1:09:21] from a slave
[1:09:26] to a son.
[1:09:29] And the book we are going to read
[1:09:32] is the book of filmon.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Do not worry. It is just one [music]
[1:09:36] chapter.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. [singing]
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:09:57] of God. I want you to identify with a
[1:09:59] song,
[1:10:02] [singing]
[1:10:06] not just plain on words,
[1:10:09] [music]
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at your conditions
[1:10:12] and circumstances.
[1:10:16] Because this morning,
[1:10:19] I want us to go head on against the
[1:10:21] devil.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:10:26] [music]
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I am [singing]

[1:10:52] with
[1:10:54] a song. It's a new song indeed.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Old things have passed away
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; and all things have become new.
[1:11:06] [music]
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Be not afraid.
[1:11:15] in his hand.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus is here.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:11:24] [music]
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I am. I am.
[1:11:28] I am a child
[1:11:33] of God. [music]

[1:11:35] I'm no longer I'm no longer
[1:11:40] a slave
[1:11:42] to fear. [music and singing]
[1:11:46] Oh yes,
[1:11:48] I am a child [music and singing]
[1:11:52] of God
[1:11:55] from my mother's womb.
[1:12:00] You have [singing and music] chosen me.
[1:12:03] You are chosen in Christ
[1:12:06] even before the foundation of the world.
[1:12:11] my [singing and music] name.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Have you had the new birth experience?
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Have you been born again
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; into this family? [music]

[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. your love. Your blood flow

[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; I am a child
[1:13:28] of [music and singing] God.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; The book of Filimon, [music]
[1:13:39] a very small
[1:13:41] portion of scripture
[1:13:46] but carries such a weight and a death.
[1:14:01] uh it's just after Titus
[1:14:05] and
[1:14:07] just before Hebrews.
[1:14:15] So I'm going to read the first verse.
[1:14:19] and you will read the second.
[1:14:22] Forgive my English.
[1:14:25] There are those who say it is not filon
[1:14:29] but it is phimon.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; So forgive my unarned English.
[1:14:36] We are going to go with filon today.
[1:14:39] Paul
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:14:43] and Timothy our brother and to Philon
[1:14:46] our dearly beloved and fellow laborer.
[1:14:54] I don't know if it's okay if I read the
[1:14:56] first verse and then read the second
[1:14:57] verse. Yes. So I'll read the first verse
[1:14:59] and then you read the second.
[1:15:04] So over to you.
[1:15:15] Grace to you and peace from God our
[1:15:19] father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Hearing of thy love and faith which thou
[1:15:31] hast toward the Lord Jesus and toward
[1:15:34] all saints.
[1:15:48] for we have great joy and consolation in
[1:15:50] thy love because the bowels of the
[1:15:53] saints are refreshed by thee brother
[1:16:06] Yet for love's sake, I rather beseech
[1:16:09] thee, being such an one as Paul the
[1:16:11] aged, and now also as a prisoner of
[1:16:14] Jesus Christ.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Which in time past was to thee
[1:16:25] unprofitable, but now profitable to thee
[1:16:29] and to me.
[1:16:39] whom I would have retained with me, that
[1:16:41] in thy state he might have ministered
[1:16:44] unto me in the bones of the gospel.
[1:16:58] for perhaps he therefore departed for a
[1:17:00] season that thou should receive him
[1:17:03] forever.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; To thee both in the
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; If thou count me therefore a partner,
[1:17:23] receive him as myself.
[1:17:36] I have written it with mine own hand. I
[1:17:38] will repay it. I be it. I do not say to
[1:17:41] thee how thou owest unto me even thine
[1:17:44] own self besides
[1:17:50] thee.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Having confidence in thy obedience, I
[1:17:58] wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt
[1:18:01] also do more than I see.
[1:18:15] There salute thee Aperas, my fellow
[1:18:18] prisoner in Christ Jesus.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
[1:18:30] with your spirit. And the church says,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; amen. Amen.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father,
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; as we stand here together with my
[1:18:39] brother,
[1:18:41] Lord, as [clears throat] vessels that
[1:18:42] you are to use today,
[1:18:45] we surrender ourselves to you. Any man
[1:18:48] can read the Bible
[1:18:50] and flip through the pages.
[1:18:52] But it's only the lamb that can take the
[1:18:54] book,
[1:18:55] break the seals thereof, and Lord,
[1:18:58] reveal the content.
[1:19:00] Lord, may you come down with an open
[1:19:03] book for we know the Bible has become a
[1:19:06] new book.
[1:19:07] Reveal yourself unto us, Father. We
[1:19:10] surrender all things unto thee. For this
[1:19:12] we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:19:15] Christ. Amen. Amen. You can take your
[1:19:18] seats.
[1:19:20] Uh I've already given my text
[1:19:23] from a slave to a son.
[1:19:28] I'm just trusting the Lord to give me
[1:19:29] grace.
[1:19:31] I just arrived early this morning.
[1:19:35] Uh, brother Shem was gracious enough to
[1:19:37] come and pick me.
[1:19:40] We were getting to the house a few
[1:19:41] minutes past 4.
[1:19:45] So, we've really had some sleep,
[1:19:48] but we trusting God for strength
[1:19:52] to be able to preach the word in.
[1:19:54] So, God bless you so much.
[1:19:57] And for a a maybe a context to give it a
[1:19:59] little bit of a context,
[1:20:02] I want to use these words.
[1:20:05] Grace.
[1:20:07] Grace
[1:20:08] that rewrites our story.
[1:20:14] Grace that rewrites our story.
[1:20:19] Now, there's a special kind of people I
[1:20:21] want to deal with today.
[1:20:25] You know, I'm not trying to scare people
[1:20:26] or something,
[1:20:28] but I believe by the grace of God,
[1:20:31] knowing that I'm standing behind the
[1:20:33] sacrament desk,
[1:20:35] I want to deal with a group of people
[1:20:36] today.
[1:20:38] I want to deal with people that are
[1:20:41] struggling with guilt
[1:20:44] and shame. So, if you're one of those
[1:20:47] people, I want you to know that this is
[1:20:50] your son.
[1:20:52] And I want you to pay close attention
[1:20:55] because God sends inspirations our way.
[1:20:59] And if I can start putting it like this,
[1:21:02] you are in the wrong place if you just
[1:21:04] come to church because it's a Sunday.
[1:21:09] I want to tell you for sure this message
[1:21:12] we believe IS ALIVE.
[1:21:14] GOD SENDS inspirations our way
[1:21:18] FOR A PURPOSE. WHEN GOD'S WHEN GOD
[1:21:21] ANOINTS HIS SON
[1:21:24] WITH A special message,
[1:21:26] it can COME TO DELIVER PEOPLE.
[1:21:29] IT COMES SO that people can be set free.
[1:21:32] IT CAN COME SO that people can be
[1:21:34] BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. IT CAN
[1:21:36] COME SO THAT people can be filled with
[1:21:38] the Holy Ghost again.
[1:21:40] It can come for PEOPLE TO BE REVIVED.
[1:21:43] SO WAR unto you and me
[1:21:46] if WE FAIL TO CATCH WHAT GOD IS DOING IN
[1:21:49] THAT PARTICULAR TIME.
[1:21:53] REMEMBER THERE WAS A POOL AT Bethesda
[1:21:58] at BETHESDA BETHESA AND THE ANGEL WAS
[1:22:01] COMING down
[1:22:04] and WOULD START THE WATERS IN THE POOL.
[1:22:08] AND WHEN THE ANGEL START THE WATERS, IT
[1:22:10] WAS TIME FOR THE SICK PEOPLE TO ENTER
[1:22:12] THE
[1:22:14] AND THEY WERE GUARANTEED
[1:22:17] THAT AS LONG AS THEY ENTERED IN THERE,
[1:22:20] THE END OF THEIR SICKNESS
[1:22:24] WOULD BE AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT.
[1:22:27] SO I'M TELLING YOU, BROTHER, THERE'S AN
[1:22:29] ANGEL BEHIND THE
[1:22:32] ANGEL BEHIND THE BUILDING
[1:22:35] IS STRONGER [screaming]
[1:22:36] THAN THE ANGEL IN HEAVEN. COME ON,
[1:22:39] FRIEND. I'M WRITING THE MESSAGE.
[1:22:43] WHEN A PREACHER STANDS HERE, HE IS
[1:22:46] POWERFUL [screaming]
[1:22:47] BECAUSE IT IS THE CHANNEL
[1:22:50] THAT GOD IS USING.
[1:22:53] COME ON, SAINTS. DO WE READ THE MESSAGE?
[1:22:55] BROTHER PANA SAYS THE ANGEL BEHIND THE
[1:23:00] PULL.
[1:23:02] SOMEONE on the display. If you can get
[1:23:03] that for me and I see SOME PEOPLE
[1:23:05] DOUBTING.
[1:23:07] YOU COME TO CHURCH JUST FOR THE SAKE OF
[1:23:08] IT.
[1:23:10] LET ME TELL YOU, YOU'RE MISSING A LOT.
[1:23:14] THE SECRET to your DELIVERANCE
[1:23:17] IS RIGHT HERE TONIGHT
[1:23:20] IS RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING. THE TIME FOR
[1:23:22] PLAYING CHURCH IS OVER.
[1:23:26] The prophet of God says
[1:23:28] in THE MESSAGE, THIRSTING FOR LIFE,
[1:23:33] THE GOD of heaven is IN THIS BUILDING
[1:23:36] TODAY.
[1:23:37] PARAGRAPH 87.
[1:23:40] If there's someone taking note,
[1:23:43] the God that created heavens and earth
[1:23:45] is here tonight.
[1:23:47] That is what makes him god to me.
[1:23:51] HE HAD THE highest place in heaven
[1:23:54] and took the LOWEST PLACE ON EARTH.
[1:23:57] HE COME FROM THE HIGHEST HEAVEN AND WENT
[1:24:00] TO THE LOWEST HELL.
[1:24:02] BECOME YOU
[1:24:04] THAT YOU WHO THROUGH HIS GRACE
[1:24:09] MIGHT BECOME HIM. SAINTS, LET ME TELL
[1:24:12] YOU, WE HAVE RECEIVED SOMETHING
[1:24:15] THAT NOT EVEN THE DEVIL CAN TAKE AWAY
[1:24:17] FROM.
[1:24:19] THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND
[1:24:23] THE DEVIL. THE BIBLE SAYS THE DEVIL
[1:24:26] BELIEVES
[1:24:28] AND HE TREMBLES.
[1:24:30] BUT CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? BELIEVING
[1:24:34] IS NOT ENOUGH.
[1:24:36] OBEDIENCE
[1:24:38] IS WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE.
[1:24:41] WHEN YOU OBEY THE WORD [screaming]
[1:24:43] AFTER YOU HAVE BELIEVED,
[1:24:46] THAT BRINGS GOD DOWN,
[1:24:49] THAT BRINGS THE POWER, THAT BRINGS THE
[1:24:51] RESULT.
[1:24:53] ONLY BELIEVE, BUT THEN OBEY.
[1:24:58] [cheering] HALLELUJAH. ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:25:01] SO THE DEVIL CAN BELIEVE
[1:25:04] BUT HE CANNOT OBEY
[1:25:06] BUT UNTO YOU IT HAS BEEN GIVEN SOMETHING
[1:25:10] [screaming] THAT WHEN THE WORD COMES
[1:25:11] YOUR WAY
[1:25:13] I DON'T KNOW HOW I DON'T KNOW WHY
[1:25:16] [screaming]
[1:25:17] BUT WHEN I HEAR THE WORD
[1:25:20] SOMETHING DEEP DOWN INSIDE OF ME I JUST
[1:25:23] SAY AMEN.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:28] WE THROUGH HIS GRACE
[1:25:31] MIGHT become him.
[1:25:33] Sons and daughters of God.
[1:25:37] He's in the building today.
[1:25:39] Night after night, he represents
[1:25:41] himself.
[1:25:43] And I can say service after service.
[1:25:47] He represents himself.
[1:25:50] Right in your business.
[1:25:55] Now follow me closely.
[1:25:57] The church has been preached to death.
[1:26:02] People come usually to the church. They
[1:26:06] say, "Well, we'll just go."
[1:26:09] Just go because it's a duty. Sometimes,
[1:26:12] sometimes they go because there is
[1:26:14] certain ministers,
[1:26:17] great men in the land today
[1:26:20] that can really bring out a sermon
[1:26:23] and they go to hear that.
[1:26:26] I'm pretty sure there's that character
[1:26:27] here today
[1:26:29] simply because there was a brother FROM
[1:26:31] NAIROBI.
[1:26:32] THAT IS WHY I'M GOING TO go to church.
[1:26:35] Now, if your intentions were good
[1:26:39] and you under expectations,
[1:26:41] God bless your heart for that.
[1:26:44] BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE who will
[1:26:46] not come to a Wednesday service
[1:26:49] because it is brother Martin preaching.
[1:26:52] I didn't get it. They won't come to a
[1:26:54] Wednesday service.
[1:26:57] BECAUSE PASTOR IS NOT around
[1:27:00] and it is brother Martin
[1:27:02] and it is brother Julius preaching.
[1:27:05] Brother Julius has nothing to tell you.
[1:27:07] I can only go to church when it is THE
[1:27:09] PASTOR PREACHING.
[1:27:11] THE CHURCH HAS HAD ENOUGH [screaming]
[1:27:13] SERMONS.
[1:27:15] But there's something that we're LOOKING
[1:27:16] FOR
[1:27:19] GREAT men in the land today that can
[1:27:20] really bring OUT A GREAT SERMON.
[1:27:23] AND THEY got to hear that.
[1:27:27] But what WE REALLY OUGHT TO GO TO CHURCH
[1:27:31] was to find Christ.
[1:27:34] YOU JUST GO TO CHURCH
[1:27:37] TO WORSHIP,
[1:27:39] TO LOOK AT YOUR BROTHER, TO LOOK AT YOUR
[1:27:42] SISTER, TO WORSHIP
[1:27:45] UNTIL
[1:27:47] YOU CAN EXPEL ALL YOUR GUILT AND SHAME.
[1:27:52] [screaming]
[1:27:56] Is there somebody who's guilty today?
[1:28:00] Uhoh. I'm preaching to guiltless people.
[1:28:05] So I I change the sermon.
[1:28:08] [laughter]
[1:28:10] Should I change the sermon?
[1:28:13] IF YOU'RE GUILTY,
[1:28:15] THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THAT GUILT CAN
[1:28:18] BE STRIPPED OFF. IF YOU'RE HAVING SHAME,
[1:28:20] [screaming]
[1:28:22] THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THAT SHAME CAN
[1:28:25] BE STRIPPED OFF AND HE says
[1:28:29] uh expel all your guilt and SHAME
[1:28:33] FROM all the world
[1:28:35] and its GLOOM OUT OF YOUR hearts
[1:28:38] and let Christ come in,
[1:28:42] GOD'S satisfying portion.
[1:28:46] Then you will have eternal life.
[1:28:50] Who is here?
[1:28:52] Who is here?
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; HIS SPIRIT
[1:28:56] IS HERE. HIS SPIRIT WANTS TO MOVE
[1:29:01] IN THIS CHURCH.
[1:29:05] DO YOU BELIEVE IT NOW? We can start.
[1:29:11] Praise the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:29:13] You love the Lord. We read in the
[1:29:16] scriptures
[1:29:17] about this man by the name of Onesimus
[1:29:22] Onesimus.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; But before we get to Onesimus,
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; the letter is addressed to Filimon.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; So I want to put it like this on
[1:29:33] is a little mystery
[1:29:36] that is hidden
[1:29:38] in the letter of Filimon.
[1:29:40] PAUL THE MESSENGER is writing a letter
[1:29:45] to Filimon and he has some very uh odd
[1:29:49] request if I put it like that
[1:29:52] because just to put some background to
[1:29:54] the story
[1:29:59] was a man that had been converted to
[1:30:02] Christ
[1:30:04] through the ministry of Paul
[1:30:07] and now Filimon in In his house, he had
[1:30:12] servants. And you know the purpose of a
[1:30:15] slave in a household
[1:30:18] is to fulfill the will of his master.
[1:30:21] In other words, a slave was just as
[1:30:26] equal
[1:30:28] to a prisoner. They didn't have rights.
[1:30:32] THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY RIGHTS TO
[1:30:33] THEMSELVES. Whatever the master said,
[1:30:36] that is what WOULD GO.
[1:30:38] THEY WERE UNDER their masters
[1:30:42] their entire life. We can go in the Old
[1:30:45] Testament and we could hear of the
[1:30:47] trumpet of Jubilee.
[1:30:50] How upon the blowing of the trumpet of
[1:30:52] Jubilee,
[1:30:54] you are a slave. The trumpet of Jubilee
[1:30:58] divide your freedom.
[1:31:01] But in this kind of place
[1:31:04] in the Roman households,
[1:31:06] there was nothing about the trumpet of
[1:31:08] Jubilee.
[1:31:10] If you are bought as a slave,
[1:31:13] if you had been sold as a slave,
[1:31:16] you are a slave for life.
[1:31:18] Your entire LIFE WILL BE TIED TO YOUR
[1:31:22] MASTER
[1:31:23] FOR AS long as you live. The only thing
[1:31:26] that will lose you from your master
[1:31:30] is death
[1:31:32] or if out [clears throat] of the
[1:31:33] goodness of your of his heart
[1:31:37] your master decided to set you free.
[1:31:40] So and in the household of filon
[1:31:44] there was such a man by the name of
[1:31:46] Onesimus.
[1:31:48] Now this man Onesimus
[1:31:50] he was a slave. Yes. And when he robbed
[1:31:53] his master
[1:31:56] He fled.
[1:31:58] He fled. He ran away.
[1:32:00] He ran away to Rome.
[1:32:02] And when he flees to Rome, this is a
[1:32:05] place where he meets Paul.
[1:32:09] Now, Matthew,
[1:32:11] it was one thing for a slave to run
[1:32:14] away. That was punishable.
[1:32:19] It was another thing for a slave to run
[1:32:21] away after having stolen
[1:32:25] from his master.
[1:32:32] SO HE STOLE
[1:32:34] and he ran away. If he had RAN AWAY
[1:32:37] AND HE CAME BACK just like that, the
[1:32:40] master would have been gracious and
[1:32:41] maybe forgiven
[1:32:43] and he never do that again. Never run
[1:32:44] away. But now he has stolen the master's
[1:32:48] possession
[1:32:50] and he runs away. That is what we call a
[1:32:53] double tragedy.
[1:32:56] Double trouble. So even if halfway in
[1:32:59] the journey he regrets his decision
[1:33:03] and he THINKS OF GOING BACK, HE LOOKS AT
[1:33:06] WHAT HE STOLEN and he says because of
[1:33:08] this I cannot go back. I'm speaking to
[1:33:11] somebody today. Somebody that has been A
[1:33:14] BELIEVER HAS BEEN FAITHFUL BUT THEN THEY
[1:33:17] HAPPEN TO slip and fall.
[1:33:20] They happen TO DO SOMETHING THAT FILLS
[1:33:22] THEM WITH A LOT OF GUILT,
[1:33:24] that fills them with A LOT OF SHAME. AND
[1:33:27] THEY SAY, "IF MAYBE I HAD DONE THIS,
[1:33:31] MAYBE GOD WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED ME BACK.
[1:33:34] BUT NOW THAT I HAVE DONE THIS AND THIS
[1:33:35] AND THIS, MY LIFE IS IN A WORSE
[1:33:38] CONDITION." NOW I AM SPEAKING ABOUT
[1:33:41] ONESIMUS TODAY
[1:33:43] BECAUSE ONESSIMAS
[1:33:45] IS A MYSTERY
[1:33:47] HIDDEN IN THE BOOK.
[1:33:50] THE LETTER WAS TO FILM BUT THE CONTENTS
[1:33:54] OF THE [screaming] LETTER
[1:33:57] WAS TIED RIGHT THERE.
[1:34:01] WE ARE MOVING. So we see on
[1:34:06] being a man that he was
[1:34:10] meets Paul
[1:34:12] and by the preaching of Paul his life is
[1:34:15] changed. His life is transformed. He
[1:34:18] becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:34:21] The same way you and I when we came
[1:34:24] across the message of our messenger.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; I don't know how you met this message.
[1:34:30] Maybe you listen to the tape. You listen
[1:34:33] to spiritual amnesia.
[1:34:35] You listen to the you listen to
[1:34:37] spiritual amnesia.
[1:34:40] Maybe you listen to look away to Jesus.
[1:34:43] Maybe you read THE CHURCH BOOK. ARE ANY
[1:34:46] OF THESE THINGS?
[1:34:48] AND FROM THAT ENCOUNTER,
[1:34:51] YOUR CONNECTION
[1:34:53] AS ONESIMUS,
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm preaching to
[1:34:58] somebody.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Friends, the Bible has become a new
[1:35:04] book.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; We are not preaching the Bible
[1:35:10] like a newspaper.
[1:35:12] WE ARE SEEING OURSELVES
[1:35:14] [screaming] WRITING THE SCRIPTURES.
[1:35:18] BRETHREN, THIS IS OUR FAMILY ALBUM.
[1:35:22] THIS IS OUR FAMILY ALBUM.
[1:35:25] WHEN WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE BIBLE,
[1:35:28] WE SEE ABRAHAM.
[1:35:30] Abraham is our father of faith. We move
[1:35:34] along. WE SEE MOSES. WE SEE DAVID. WE
[1:35:38] SEE JOB. WHO ARE THIS? THIS IS A CLOUD
[1:35:42] OF WITNESSES.
[1:35:45] [cheering and applause]
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; So I I I don't want to preach to people
[1:35:51] that are looking to me as if I'm
[1:35:52] preaching Greek.
[1:35:55] I am not speaking about Onesimus.
[1:35:58] I am speaking ABOUT YOU
[1:36:02] TYPED IN THE BIBLE.
[1:36:04] [screaming]
[1:36:07] [laughter] Let me support that with a
[1:36:08] quote. Now,
[1:36:10] you give me this code in the message
[1:36:11] identification.
[1:36:15] The message identification 64
[1:36:18] 640216
[1:36:23] 40216 paragraph 2 uh uh paragraph 27
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; and he says I just wonder today
[1:36:32] if we couldn't look in the Bible
[1:36:35] and say
[1:36:37] that IS ME.
[1:36:40] YOU remember the story of that little
[1:36:42] boy that had never seen a mirror before.
[1:36:46] The only thing he's ever known
[1:36:49] was just a little piece
[1:36:51] that his father used to use while he was
[1:36:54] shaving the beard. It was just a little
[1:36:57] piece. If you wanted to look at the
[1:36:58] beard
[1:37:01] here, you have to place
[1:37:04] you have to turn the eyes.
[1:37:08] That is what he knew.
[1:37:10] until one time he visited his relative
[1:37:14] AND HE GOT INTO THE HOUSE AND HE SAW
[1:37:17] SOMETHING THAT WAS SUCH A BIG LAUGH AND
[1:37:21] HE MOVED CLOSER AND THE MOMENT HE MOVED
[1:37:23] CLOSER HE SAW ANOTHER BOY IN THE MIRROR.
[1:37:28] LET ME DRAMATIZE it for you.
[1:37:31] I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THE MIRROR
[1:37:34] [screaming]
[1:37:35] WAS SEVEN steps higher.
[1:37:38] THE MIRROR WAS SOMEWHERE UP ABOVE.
[1:37:42] SO HE HAD TO CLIMB UP 17.
[1:37:46] HE HAD TO CLIMB FAITH,
[1:37:48] VIRTUE,
[1:37:50] TEMPERANCE.
[1:37:52] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:37:53] HE HAD TO CLIMB UP. THE STATES ARE OUR
[1:37:56] PERFECT MAN.
[1:37:59] GOT ON TOP. HE SAW SOMEBODY
[1:38:03] THAT WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HAND, THE PERSON
[1:38:06] IN THE MIRROR LIFTED HIS HAND. WHEN HE
[1:38:09] LIFTED HIS HAND, THE PERSON IN THE
[1:38:11] MIRROR LIFTED THEIR HAND. WHEN HE RAISED
[1:38:15] THE [screaming] OTHER HAND
[1:38:16] WHEN HE SAID HELLO, THE BOY SAID HELLO.
[1:38:20] AND REVELATION
[1:38:22] AND HE SAID MAMA. [screaming]
[1:38:24] SOMEBODY SAY MAMA.
[1:38:27] THAT IS ME. [screaming]
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; AND MY BROTHER, MY SISTER,
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE MET.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE [screaming] MET THE MESSAGE OF
[1:38:35] MALACHI.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; AND AS ON,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO JESUS.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; HERE WAS ONESIMUS.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; PAUL HAS WRITTEN A LETTER. HE'S CARRYING
[1:38:46] THE LETTER AND HE'S GOING TO FILL HIM.
[1:38:50] HE'S GOING TO FEEL
[1:38:52] CARRYING A LETTER THAT SPEAKS ABOUT HIM.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE JOURNEY.
[1:39:03] HE HE LEFT HIS MASTER'S HOME
[1:39:06] WITH SHAME,
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; WITH GUILT, WITH A LOT OF OPPRESSION.
[1:39:12] BUT WHEN HE MEETS THE MESSAGE,
[1:39:14] WHEN HE GETS IN CONTACT WITH THE
[1:39:16] MESSAGE,
[1:39:18] SOMETHING HAPPENED. AND NOW THE
[1:39:21] HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Give me that quote, brother.
[1:39:25] I want us to identify our position in
[1:39:27] THE WORLD.
[1:39:29] You know how WE OVERCOME THE DEVIL.
[1:39:32] HOW WE SHAKE OF THE GUILT AND THE SHAME
[1:39:35] IS BY knowing who we are.
[1:39:41] I'm going to be a bit radical TODAY
[1:39:45] where you will disassociate YOURSELF
[1:39:50] from anything that is not of God. Amen.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; I would really want us to read that if
[1:39:59] you can find it. Yes. No, no, no, no.
[1:40:02] Identification. Identification.
[1:40:05] I'm giving this to to give you some time
[1:40:07] to look at it. Amen. If I have this
[1:40:10] shirt
[1:40:13] and this shirt is dirty,
[1:40:15] can I ask you a question?
[1:40:18] Am I dirty?
[1:40:24] What is that?
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; The shirt. Is that right?
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; So I can disassociate myself
[1:40:33] and say I AM NOT DIRT THAT
[1:40:36] I am just wearing a dirty.
[1:40:41] Hallelujah. I AM NOT A SINNER.
[1:40:45] I HAVE JUST PUT ON A BODY OF SIN
[1:40:49] AND WITH THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO WALK IN
[1:40:52] THIS WORLD.
[1:40:54] TELL THE DEVIL
[1:40:56] IF YOU SUBJECT THIS BODY TO SIN.
[1:41:00] THE REAL ME WILL SUBJECT THE SAME SAME
[1:41:03] BODY
[1:41:05] TO FASTING AND PRAYER
[1:41:08] TO PRAISING AND [screaming] WORSHIP.
[1:41:11] AND WHEN I COME TO CHURCH
[1:41:14] AND I [screaming] WORSHIP,
[1:41:16] WHAT HAPPENS?
[1:41:18] THE SHAME FALLS AWAY.
[1:41:20] THE KILL FALLS AWAY.
[1:41:24] HALLELUJAH. [applause]
[1:41:27] We in the business of LAUNDRY
[1:41:34] as instituted by Paul
[1:41:38] because he said we are being washed by
[1:41:40] the water and the what?
[1:41:44] SO WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH,
[1:41:46] LAUNDRY BUSINESS IS HAPPENING.
[1:41:50] THAT IS WHY THE PASTOR HAS TO GET THIS
[1:41:53] QUART
[1:41:54] HAS TO GET THAT THAT SCRIPTURE. HE'S
[1:41:57] MIXING THE CHEEK.
[1:42:00] HE'S MIXING THE WATER AND SOMETIMES
[1:42:04] IT CAN SCRATCH.
[1:42:06] IT CAN BE ROUGH. [screaming]
[1:42:08] WHAT IS HAPPENING?
[1:42:10] SCRUBBING THE CLOTHES.
[1:42:12] SCRUBBING AND SCRUBBING.
[1:42:14] BECAUSE YOU OUGHT TO BE CLEAN.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, PERFECT
[1:42:20] AS YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER [screaming] IS
[1:42:22] ALSO PERFECT.
[1:42:26] [applause and cheering]
[1:42:29] This is identification.
[1:42:32] Are you in 64? Go to 64.
[1:42:40] I don't know why the devil does not want
[1:42:42] us to read this.
[1:42:44] Even if it takes 10 minutes, we are
[1:42:46] going to
[1:42:48] I'm not in a rush.
[1:42:51] 642164216
[1:42:56] paragraph 27.
[1:43:04] So I just wonder today
[1:43:07] if we couldn't look in the Bible
[1:43:12] and say
[1:43:15] that is me.
[1:43:20] What are you looking at today?
[1:43:24] Are you busy looking at football?
[1:43:27] Busy looking into politics.
[1:43:30] YOU CANNOT FIND YOUR IDENTIFICATION.
[1:43:34] You have the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; You [clears throat] can't go into
[1:43:38] another family
[1:43:41] and start looking at your looking for
[1:43:43] your PHOTO
[1:43:46] in the album of another family.
[1:43:56] You cannot come to my house
[1:43:58] and start looking for your photo in my
[1:44:00] house.
[1:44:02] You're not a part of my family.
[1:44:04] BUT IF MY DAUGHTER COMES AND SAYS,
[1:44:06] "DADDY, I want to see MYSELF IN YOUR
[1:44:09] PHOTO. You open your album."
[1:44:13] I just said, "Daughter, come let's not
[1:44:15] even go far and I'll come to the phone
[1:44:18] and write in the phone. My daughter will
[1:44:21] be able to see."
[1:44:23] So I just wonder today if we couldn't
[1:44:26] look in the Bible
[1:44:29] and say THAT IS ME AS WE WONDER which
[1:44:33] one is it?
[1:44:35] Which character in the Bible would we
[1:44:37] look like?
[1:44:42] Let's just take that for a little text
[1:44:43] now
[1:44:45] and stay with it for a while.
[1:44:49] And as we look into God's word,
[1:44:52] let us do something here.
[1:44:54] Let us identify ourselves.
[1:44:59] For he gives others in there
[1:45:04] for examples
[1:45:06] of what we are.
[1:45:11] Now remember that God takes his spirit
[1:45:17] or takes his man
[1:45:20] It was never his spirit.
[1:45:23] Satan takes HIS MAN
[1:45:25] never his spirit.
[1:45:28] So let us see IF WE CAN IDENTIFY our
[1:45:32] present state now with Bible character.
[1:45:42] God takes his man.
[1:45:44] Did God take Paul?
[1:45:47] DID GOD TAKE ON ESIMUS?
[1:45:50] BUT HE never took AWAY THE SPIRIT.
[1:45:53] So the same same ministering spirit
[1:45:56] is right HERE EVEN THIS DAY. SO WE see
[1:46:00] we can be able to identify ourselves
[1:46:04] with Onesimus this morning
[1:46:07] because the life of Onesimus
[1:46:09] is a life where we can see the grace of
[1:46:13] God in plain view.
[1:46:16] Because prophet says, Paul, he was the
[1:46:20] man who had suffered with Christ.
[1:46:23] And when that slave over there HAD RAN
[1:46:25] AWAY,
[1:46:27] PAUL HAD BORNE SO MUCH PERSECUTIONS
[1:46:31] SO MANY THINGS OF CHRIST
[1:46:34] till when that runaway slave ran away.
[1:46:38] Paul say wrote BACK TO HIS MASTER
[1:46:42] AFTER THE SLAVE had become converted,
[1:46:45] HE SAID,
[1:46:46] DON'T TREAT HIM AS A slave anymore.
[1:46:51] There's a change in designation.
[1:46:55] When grace is writing,
[1:46:59] grace does not write
[1:47:01] the HISTORY OF THE PAST.
[1:47:04] WHEN GRACE IS RIGHT,
[1:47:06] GRACE, REWRITES YOUR STORY.
[1:47:12] Wrote the story of Abraham.
[1:47:14] WE KNOW THAT ABRAHAM LIED. We know that
[1:47:19] Abraham doubted. But when Paul is
[1:47:22] writing in Romans, he says Abraham
[1:47:28] believed God.
[1:47:33] WE KNOW MOSES WAS A STAMMER.
[1:47:38] MOSES WAS WEAK. MOSES HAD TEMPER. MOSES
[1:47:44] DOUBTED GOD. WE KNOW MOSES EVEN GOT TO A
[1:47:48] POINT WHERE HE KILLED A MAN. BUT WHEN
[1:47:51] GRACE IS RIGHT IN HEBREWS 11,
[1:47:55] HE SAYS BY [screaming] FAITH MOSES WE
[1:48:00] KNOW SAMSON FELL. HE WAS DECEIVED BY A
[1:48:04] WOMAN. BUT WHEN CHRIST IS RIGHT THERE BY
[1:48:08] FAITH
[1:48:11] WE KNOW DAVID FELL DAVID FELL DAVID HAD
[1:48:17] A LOT OF WEAKNESSES BUT GRACE IS RIGHT
[1:48:22] by [screaming] faith
[1:48:27] WHAT DOES GRACE do
[1:48:29] what DOES GRACE DO
[1:48:32] GRACE REWRITE
[1:48:35] stories
[1:48:39] [applause]
[1:48:41] and the thing that I want you to get
[1:48:42] today,
[1:48:44] we are focusing on a finished work.
[1:48:49] But it's one thing for you to conduct
[1:48:52] yourself
[1:48:55] in accordance with that.
[1:49:06] Don't treat him as a SLAVE ANYMORE.
[1:49:09] TREAT him as a brother.
[1:49:12] IF HE OWES YOU ANYTHING,
[1:49:15] CHARGE IT UP TO ME.
[1:49:20] THIS is a man
[1:49:22] that only had one quote.
[1:49:27] I want you to see
[1:49:29] the cost of grace.
[1:49:34] There is no love without giving.
[1:49:37] There is no love without sacrifice.
[1:49:42] Ask me, I'll tell you.
[1:49:45] If you say you love,
[1:49:47] and you cannot give something is wrong.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Should I go home?
[1:49:54] Let me actually say this. I hope pastor
[1:49:56] is not streaming.
[1:49:58] You cannot say you love God.
[1:50:03] You cannot say you love God.
[1:50:06] And as you're coming to church,
[1:50:09] you're looking for a wrinkled up note
[1:50:15] to put in the office.
[1:50:20] You have eaten the whole week.
[1:50:24] You've actually come to church already
[1:50:25] full that
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; and you're looking for 1,000 10,000
[1:50:35] 10,000
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; 10,000
[1:50:45] 1,00
[1:50:49] trustees. Is that true?
[1:50:54] And you're coming and you say, "Oh God,
[1:50:58] watch."
[1:51:00] There is no love without giving.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Pastor did not send me to preach about
[1:51:07] money.
[1:51:10] So please do not say that he's preaching
[1:51:13] like this because pastor
[1:51:17] I am preaching by divine insight.
[1:51:23] This was not in my notes even.
[1:51:27] There is no love
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; without giving.
[1:51:33] You have put on a suit
[1:51:36] you have put on good shoes
[1:51:38] and 1,000
[1:51:42] and IN THE BACK POCKET
[1:51:44] THAT IS WHERE the 50,000
[1:51:50] M but now
[1:51:52] if you did not have change
[1:51:57] to give the 1,000 that you usually give
[1:52:00] you put two fingers in the prayer.
[1:52:04] You start searching.
[1:52:07] Let the fingers do the walking
[1:52:12] and you just pull one
[1:52:16] and you say you love God.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Be serious.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; You say you love God.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Should I continue preaching?
[1:52:37] Yes, sir.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; And yet you cannot even make it to
[1:52:39] church on time.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Yet you say you love. Actually, I'm I
[1:52:49] love God.
[1:52:52] What you love is your pastor and you do
[1:52:58] because we have an order,
[1:53:05] 30 minutes before the sun.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not telling you this because I'm
[1:53:15] also good myself.
[1:53:19] But the correct correction begins in the
[1:53:21] house of God.
[1:53:26] It is time for us to you know have a
[1:53:29] relook
[1:53:32] for God.
[1:53:35] We love God. We will give our finances.
[1:53:37] We will give our time.
[1:53:42] We will give ourselves into THE
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Do you love grace?
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; So we see this is what grace does here.
[1:54:03] you know, Paul, a man with just one
[1:54:05] coat.
[1:54:08] And here's Onesimus, who maybe stole
[1:54:10] quite, you know, some some items of
[1:54:13] value.
[1:54:17] But Paul says, "If he owes you,
[1:54:22] put it on my heart,
[1:54:27] isn't this what the Lord did for us?
[1:54:30] Don't you love him? Let's go. Now, I
[1:54:33] want to give a couple of quotes and then
[1:54:35] we we can have some some good climax as
[1:54:37] we continue to
[1:54:40] read quite a lot. See, he had been so in
[1:54:43] fellowship with Christ
[1:54:47] in his suffering
[1:54:48] till he was to be an outcast.
[1:54:57] He knowed what it was to fellowship in
[1:54:59] his suffering.
[1:55:02] He knowed how to sympathize WITH OTHERS.
[1:55:06] AND he says that's the reason Christ
[1:55:07] become human
[1:55:10] that he might know the groans of
[1:55:11] sickness
[1:55:13] the heartaches OF DISAPPOINTMENT
[1:55:17] that he WITH US
[1:55:19] MIGHT FELLOWSHIP TOGETHER.
[1:55:22] HE HAS BEEN partaking of life
[1:55:25] like we have.
[1:55:27] What a mighty God we serve.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus was tempted in all like MAN
[1:55:37] just as we are
[1:55:42] disappointments and heartaches and
[1:55:43] sickness.
[1:55:47] For he bore our sicknesses and our
[1:55:49] teeth.
[1:55:51] You love the LORD JESUS.
[1:55:53] YOU KNOW, HOWEVER, in another message,
[1:55:56] he says, "However, he ordered GREAT DEBT
[1:56:00] AND PAUL had been so into LOVE WITH
[1:56:02] CHRIST
[1:56:04] till he sent word to the master that
[1:56:06] owned the slave
[1:56:12] that now he has become a beloved
[1:56:13] brother.
[1:56:16] ALL THAT HE OWES YOU,
[1:56:19] PUT IT IN MY account and I'll pay you
[1:56:22] when I COME.
[1:56:24] PAUL had been a Christian so LONG
[1:56:28] until he knew what it was to forgive,
[1:56:33] what it meant to forgive somebody.
[1:56:37] He had been forgiven himself.
[1:56:40] And I think every Christian that's
[1:56:41] really been FORGIVEN
[1:56:44] knows the appreciation of forgiveness.
[1:56:54] Do you see what grace has done? Grace
[1:56:56] brings forgiveness.
[1:56:59] And you know that it's only by grace
[1:57:01] that to be here for us to believe this
[1:57:05] message. I am only in THIS MESSAGE BY
[1:57:08] GRACE.
[1:57:10] FOR IT'S ONLY BY GRACE THAT I'M in this
[1:57:13] message. I don't know why my Lord GOD
[1:57:16] CHOSE ME,
[1:57:17] BUT I'M SO GRATEFUL ANYWAY,
[1:57:20] BUT I KNOW IT'S ONLY BY GRACE.
[1:57:24] SO, WE ARE so grateful
[1:57:26] that God has done these things for us.
[1:57:29] So, and we SEE THAT OUR DEBT
[1:57:32] WAS PUT ON JESUS'S HEART. AND I THINK OF
[1:57:35] PAUL THERE THAT GREAT CHRISTIAN. How
[1:57:39] that his HEART HAD KNEW THAT THERE WAS A
[1:57:42] GREAT CHURCH AGAINST HIM
[1:57:45] AND CHRIST by his own blood
[1:57:48] brought his pardon at the cross.
[1:57:52] HE TOOK HIS PLACE
[1:57:54] and he knowed how to feel for other
[1:57:56] people.
[1:57:59] I'm not just reading quotes for you,
[1:58:02] but I'm pray I'm not just reading
[1:58:03] quotes,
[1:58:05] BUT I'M PRAYING THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:58:07] WILL QUICKEN THEM IN YOUR LIFE
[1:58:10] THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT IF I HAVE BEEN
[1:58:13] FORGIVEN,
[1:58:15] I SHOULD HAVE A HEART OF FORGIVENESS
[1:58:17] AND YOU HAVE A FEELING FOR THE PEOPLE
[1:58:20] BECAUSE I OWE A GREAT DEBT
[1:58:23] AND IT WAS PUT ON JESUS'S HEART.
[1:58:27] AND CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
[1:58:28] JESUS?
[1:58:30] THAT DEBT [screaming]
[1:58:31] IS NOT SOMEWHEREING
[1:58:34] SOME INTEREST
[1:58:37] OR ACREWING SOME PENALTIES.
[1:58:40] NO SIR, NO SIR. THAT DEBT HAS ALREADY
[1:58:44] BEEN PAID WHILE HE WAS ON THE CROSS.
[1:58:48] I [screaming]
[1:58:49] WAS ON HIS MIND AND HE SAID
[1:58:53] IT IS FINISHED.
[1:58:56] SO NOW TONIGHT I CAN START WITH BOLDNESS
[1:59:01] like Onesimus
[1:59:03] because SEE WE ARE IDENTIFYING
[1:59:07] WITH Onesimus today.
[1:59:10] So if you are identifying as
[1:59:13] I want us to go to anus for a MINUTE
[1:59:17] INTERACTED WITH PAUL
[1:59:20] HE has listened to the message of his
[1:59:21] day
[1:59:24] he HAS BEEN CONVERTED
[1:59:26] and now he's been given a letter
[1:59:30] and YOU KNOW THE LETTER
[1:59:32] IN THOSE olden days
[1:59:35] in the olden days the the letter was
[1:59:40] written. And after being written, you
[1:59:43] know, the writer would sign
[1:59:46] and to ensure that it is secure,
[1:59:49] they would ROLL IT UP and put a seal on
[1:59:53] it.
[1:59:55] And once the letter gets to the
[1:59:57] recipient,
[2:00:00] THE RECIPIENT REALIZES
[2:00:03] THAT THIS LETTER
[2:00:05] HAS NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH.
[2:00:08] SO IF THERE'S A SECRET
[2:00:11] THAT IS CONTAINED IN THAT LETTER,
[2:00:14] IT IS STILL a secret
[2:00:16] and NOBODY HAS READ IT. BUT CAN I GIVE
[2:00:19] YOU A SECRET?
[2:00:21] THE LETTER.
[2:00:24] HALLELUJAH. The letter. GO WITH ME
[2:00:26] SAINTS
[2:00:28] BECAUSE WE need to come to a time where
[2:00:30] this message becomes a reality.
[2:00:35] are not just some 1,200 SERMONS
[2:00:42] by a man from Kentucky.
[2:00:48] God's love letter TO US.
[2:00:51] THIS is the token.
[2:00:54] THIS IS THE LETTER
[2:00:56] THAT PAUL, THE MESSENGER OF THE AGE,
[2:01:00] [screaming] HAS GIVEN TO ONESSIMUS
[2:01:03] SO THAT ONESIMUS
[2:01:06] AS YOU CAME FROM WHERE YOU CAME FROM,
[2:01:09] YOU CAME IN A FALLEN CONDITION.
[2:01:12] COME ON SOMEBODY. [screaming]
[2:01:15] YOU CAME FROM WHERE YOU CAME FROM
[2:01:17] IN A FALLEN CONDITION.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; BUT I AM GIVING YOU SOMETHING.
[2:01:23] AND WHAT I AM GIVING YOU NOW
[2:01:26] CONTAINS
[2:01:28] THE SECRET
[2:01:30] OF YOUR NEW NAME. [screaming]
[2:01:34] HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; PREACH WITH ME, SOMEBODY.
[2:01:39] PREACH WITH ME. PREACH WITH ME NOW. THE
[2:01:41] LETTER THAT YOU'RE GOING BACK WITH
[2:01:45] CARRIES
[2:01:46] YOUR NEW IDENTIFICATION.
[2:01:49] [screaming] I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY
[2:01:53] YOU ARE.
[2:01:54] I DON'T CARE WHAT [screaming] NAMES THEY
[2:01:56] HAVE CALLED YOU. ONESIMUS.
[2:02:00] IN THIS LETTER, THERE'S A MYSTERY
[2:02:04] [screaming] THAT TELLS YOU,
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NO LONGER A SLAVE.
[2:02:09] [screaming]
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE MY BROTHER
[2:02:12] and you have received.
[2:02:16] HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECEIVED
[2:02:18] FROM OUR prophet messenger.
[2:02:22] PAUL IS A TYPE OF CAN I TELL YOU?
[2:02:27] IT'S EASIER TO BRIDGE TYPES
[2:02:31] FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT,
[2:02:33] but when we get TO THE NEW TESTAMENT,
[2:02:36] IT BECOMES REAL AND SOON
[2:02:39] because grace has already BEEN REVEALED.
[2:02:42] WE ARE NOT SEEING GRACE
[2:02:45] IN SHADOW FORM.
[2:02:48] BUT WE ARE SEEING GRACE
[2:02:50] IN A MAN WHO CALLED APOSTLE PAUL.
[2:02:58] Go with me. In the Old Testament,
[2:03:02] it was types and sh.
[2:03:06] But now IN THE NEW TESTAMENT,
[2:03:08] WHY DID PAUL say
[2:03:10] follow me as I follow Christ?
[2:03:15] Because it is no longer PAUL LIVE.
[2:03:18] IT IS CHRIST.
[2:03:20] WHATEVER is coming FROM PAUL
[2:03:24] IS A REFLECTION FROM
[2:03:27] SO WE ARE NO LONGER IN A GLARE AT ALL.
[2:03:31] Inspiration is coming my way.
[2:03:34] We are no longer we are no longer
[2:03:38] walking by a glare.
[2:03:42] You can find quotations where brother
[2:03:43] Brham says that
[2:03:46] that those that never MOVED
[2:03:50] with the revelation of the word in their
[2:03:52] day,
[2:03:55] they were living using a past life.
[2:03:59] They were living with a glare.
[2:04:04] And the other word for a glare
[2:04:08] IS FALSE LIGHT.
[2:04:12] SO WE ARE NOT walking by the glare
[2:04:14] anymore.
[2:04:16] WE are walking in A TIME
[2:04:19] WHERE THE BIBLE
[2:04:21] IS NO LONGER IN PAGE FOUR.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE [screaming]
[2:04:26] IS WALKING ON.
[2:04:29] THAT IS WHAT
[2:04:32] PAUL [screaming]
[2:04:33] WAS TO ONESIMA.
[2:04:37] PAUL WAS NOT PREACHING TO ONESIMUS
[2:04:41] BY WHAT?
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; HIS ACTIONS
[2:04:46] WERE A TESTIMONY AND PREACHING TO
[2:04:48] ONESIMUS.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; You are my brother.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; And we've received
[2:05:02] one like Paul as well.
[2:05:05] Did Paul meet with the pillar of fire?
[2:05:08] Did he converse with THE PILLAR OF FIRE?
[2:05:11] SO WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSENGER
[2:05:14] OF THE caliber of Paul.
[2:05:17] THAT'S THE REASON WHY.
[2:05:19] HE WAS VERY VERY WATCHFUL.
[2:05:22] [screaming] HE asked
[2:05:25] will Paul be judged?
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; I don't care. Let them let them call me
[2:05:34] a brand.
[2:05:36] BUT I AM A BELIEVER
[2:05:39] OF THE MESSAGE
[2:05:41] OF WILLIAM.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; AND I BELIEVE HE IS GOD'S VINDICATED
[2:05:47] PROATION.
[2:05:52] HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Can I show you something?
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Paul
[2:06:00] refers to Onesimus.
[2:06:03] as a psalm.
[2:06:07] Is that right? We read it together
[2:06:11] that I have begotten him.
[2:06:14] You know, begotten is to bear
[2:06:18] to bring forth. So in other words,
[2:06:21] Onesimus is a son to Paul.
[2:06:27] And you know we also sons
[2:06:30] of brother Brahham.
[2:06:32] Hallelujah.
[2:06:34] What happened
[2:06:36] one one morning early morning
[2:06:39] sleeping on the on the bed his arms
[2:06:41] behind his head and he's wondering what
[2:06:45] happens when people die.
[2:06:47] When I die will I just be like a cloud
[2:06:50] floating
[2:06:51] in the air.
[2:06:53] I'll be moving in church and sing
[2:06:55] brother
[2:06:57] I can speak to him and he can speak
[2:07:00] and at that point a voice tells him who
[2:07:04] would you like to see
[2:07:06] beyond the curtain of time
[2:07:09] yes I would LIKE THAT VERY MUCH
[2:07:12] he crosses over TO THE OTHER SIDE
[2:07:14] AND THE voice speaks to him you remember
[2:07:19] how you read in the Bible
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; that when the prophets and the fathers
[2:07:25] They were gathered with their people.
[2:07:29] And he said, "Yes, I remember.
[2:07:31] But do you mean that all these are
[2:07:34] broms?
[2:07:37] We are not so manys in our families like
[2:07:39] this.
[2:07:42] So, brother Brham was looking at people
[2:07:46] and thinking that they his family.
[2:07:54] But the angel CORRECTS HIM.
[2:07:57] THESE ARE not physical brands.
[2:08:00] THESE ARE THEY [screaming] THAT WERE
[2:08:03] CONVERTED TO CHRIST
[2:08:06] BY BELIEVING YOUR MESSAGE.
[2:08:09] I AM PROUD
[2:08:11] TO BE IDENTIFIED
[2:08:14] AS A BRANHAM TODAY. [screaming] I AM A
[2:08:17] SON OF BRANHAM.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; I AM BEGOTTEN OF BRHAM
[2:08:22] BECAUSE BRANHAM
[2:08:24] IS A PARALLEL
[2:08:27] OF [screaming] ABRAHAM.
[2:08:29] HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:32] THE SAME WAY THAT ABRAHAM had a seed and
[2:08:38] those were God's people at that time,
[2:08:41] God also has a seed in the
[2:08:45] God also HAS A SEED.
[2:08:48] AND WHAT DOES THE PROPHET ASK? You know,
[2:08:50] you know, he was very very careful.
[2:08:55] Will Paul be judged?
[2:08:59] And what did the voice tell him?
[2:09:01] Yes, he will do.
[2:09:03] And what did he say?
[2:09:06] If Paul's people shall ENTER
[2:09:12] IN OTHER WORDS, IF ONESIMUS SHALL ENTER,
[2:09:16] [screaming]
[2:09:18] BRETHREN, CATCH IT. CATCH IT. CATCH IT.
[2:09:21] [screaming] THIS WAS NOT ABOUT A GROUP
[2:09:23] OF PEOPLE.
[2:09:26] IF THE STANDARD THAT PAUL SET,
[2:09:30] he could REWRITE
[2:09:33] THE STORY OF ANIME.
[2:09:36] given me IN MY DISPENSATION
[2:09:40] AS A STAR
[2:09:42] IN THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD [screaming]
[2:09:45] IN THE church book.
[2:09:48] Brother Brandham says that the big star
[2:09:52] will be shining its light
[2:09:55] and there will be other other stars
[2:09:59] that will be drawing light.
[2:10:03] SO ONESIMUS
[2:10:05] WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT DREW FROM PAUL.
[2:10:10] SO IF PAUL'S PEOPLE SHALL ENTER,
[2:10:15] Christianity is not A GROUP AFFAIR.
[2:10:18] THIS is an individual.
[2:10:21] SO IF ONESIMUS [screaming]
[2:10:22] SHALL ENTER,
[2:10:25] HAVE I BEEN IDENTIFIED with Onesim?
[2:10:29] SO IF ONESIMA SHALL ENTER,
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; THEN MY PEOPLE
[2:10:34] SHALL also enter.
[2:10:37] [screaming] HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:39] [applause]
[2:10:41] Praise God. Amen.
[2:10:43] This is what grace has done for us.
[2:10:46] THIS IS WHAT God's mercy
[2:10:49] has brought our way.
[2:10:52] OUR STORIES
[2:10:54] HAVE BEEN REWRITTEN.
[2:10:56] PRAISE THE name of the Lord Jesus
[2:10:57] Christ.
[2:10:59] Oh, he says here that now
[2:11:02] IN TIMES PAST
[2:11:04] HE WAS unprofitable unto thee
[2:11:08] but now profitable
[2:11:11] to you and me. You see the name
[2:11:15] Onesimus,
[2:11:17] the meaning of that name
[2:11:19] meant or rather means one that is
[2:11:24] profitable,
[2:11:26] ONE THAT IS USEFUL, THAT IS THE meaning
[2:11:31] of the name on.
[2:11:33] So Onesimus had a name
[2:11:36] BUT HIS LIFE
[2:11:38] WAS NOT PROJECTING
[2:11:41] THE REALITY
[2:11:43] OF HIS NAME.
[2:11:44] UNTIL HE GOT INTO CONTACT WITH THE
[2:11:46] MESSAGE OF THE HOUSE.
[2:11:48] AND WHEN HE GOT IN CONTACT WITH THE
[2:11:50] MESSAGE OF THE HOUSE,
[2:11:52] THE CHARACTER THAT WAS IN HIM,
[2:11:55] YOUR NAME
[2:11:57] is your character.
[2:12:00] Remember, I'm not speaking ABOUT THE
[2:12:02] NORMAL NAME.
[2:12:04] I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT JULIUS.
[2:12:07] PRAISE THE NAME OF THE Lord Jesus. I'm
[2:12:09] not about the name Kennedy. Kennedy. No
[2:12:12] sir, I AM SPEAKING ABOUT THE NAME
[2:12:16] THAT YOU HAD EVEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[2:12:20] OF YOUR LIFE.
[2:12:22] DO YOU KNOW WHAT NAME THAT IS? I'M GOING
[2:12:25] TO TELL IT TO YOU NOW. THE FAMILY IN
[2:12:28] heaven
[2:12:30] and THE FAMILY ON EARTH
[2:12:33] IS KNOWN BY ONE NAME.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; WHAT [screaming] NAME IS THAT?
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:12:41] AND I SEE I SEE
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANA
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; AS HE'S preaching the seals he says I no
[2:12:50] longer CALL YOU CHURCH
[2:12:52] I CALL YOU BRIDE
[2:12:55] I CALL you Mrs. JESUS.
[2:13:00] What is the opening OF THE SEAL?
[2:13:03] IT IS THE LETTER THAT PAUL HAS WRITTEN
[2:13:08] ROLLED UP AND SEALED.
[2:13:11] BUT AS ONESIMUS
[2:13:14] IS CARRYING IT AND HE'S GOING TO FILM,
[2:13:18] THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER
[2:13:22] ARE NOT A MYSTERY TO HIM.
[2:13:30] WE came into this world having fallen,
[2:13:35] born in sin, shaped in iniquity.
[2:13:39] We came into THIS WORLD SPEAKING LIES.
[2:13:41] BUT WE'VE COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE
[2:13:43] MESSAGE OF THE PAST.
[2:13:45] THE BIBLE has become a new book.
[2:13:48] And we ARE NOW ON A JOURNEY.
[2:13:50] WE ARE GOING BACK TO WHERE WE CAME FROM.
[2:13:53] WE ARE GOING BACK TO GOD. WE ARE GOING
[2:13:56] TO FILM.
[2:13:58] WE CAME FROM GOD
[2:14:01] NOT THE WAY WE WERE supposed to go.
[2:14:07] This is your life.
[2:14:10] We came from God.
[2:14:13] Having bypassed our theory,
[2:14:17] THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY
[2:14:20] OF A slave being set free.
[2:14:24] But Onesimus
[2:14:26] made himself FREE
[2:14:29] CONTRARY
[2:14:31] to the provisions OF THE MASTER.
[2:14:34] SO he went contrary to the will OF HIS
[2:14:36] MASTER.
[2:14:38] HE CAME INTO THIS WORLD from the
[2:14:41] thoughts OF GOD.
[2:14:43] INTO THE FLESH
[2:14:45] HAVING BYPASSED OUR THEOPIA
[2:14:49] which is the word body.
[2:14:51] SO AND THAT PUT US IN SLAVERY
[2:14:56] AND NOW AS we are going BACK
[2:15:00] we are going with A LETTER.
[2:15:03] WE ARE GOING WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE
[2:15:07] WE ARE GOING WITH A TALKING.
[2:15:10] HALLELUJAH. It's not SINKING
[2:15:16] MEET WITH THE MESSENGER.
[2:15:18] FROM THE MOMENT SHE MEETS THE MESSENGER,
[2:15:21] HER LIFE IS CHANGED.
[2:15:24] ARE YOU WITH ME? SO WHEN JUDGMENT IS
[2:15:26] COMING TO FALL,
[2:15:29] ALL she had to do
[2:15:32] was display the token.
[2:15:35] AND AS LONG AS THE TOKEN WAS ON DISPLAY,
[2:15:39] NO DISTRACTION.
[2:15:41] WILL COME UPON HER.
[2:15:43] SO THE TOKEN
[2:15:45] IS NOT JUST BEING displayed for THE SAKE
[2:15:47] OF IT.
[2:15:49] RA ALSO HAD TO KNOW
[2:15:53] WHAT THIS token
[2:15:56] what THIS
[2:15:59] WHAT THIS TOKEN.
[2:16:02] SHE HAS TO KNOW
[2:16:04] WHAT THIS TOKEN
[2:16:06] MEANS TO HER
[2:16:08] IN HER [screaming] HOUSE.
[2:16:11] SO THAT SHE DOES NOT APPLY THE TOKEN
[2:16:15] BUT SHE'S OUTSIDE LOTTERYING.
[2:16:18] HE HAS TO APPLY THE TOKEN
[2:16:21] AND STAY IN THE HOUSE
[2:16:23] AND [screaming] WAIT UNTIL
[2:16:27] SO ONESIMUS
[2:16:29] HAS TO CARRY THE LETTER
[2:16:31] AND AS HE'S CARRY AS HE'S CARRYING THE
[2:16:33] LETTER
[2:16:34] HE HAS TO KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THE
[2:16:38] LETTER
[2:16:39] BECAUSE THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER
[2:16:42] WILL DETERMINE
[2:16:45] HOW HE BEHAVES
[2:16:47] IN THE JOURNEY.
[2:16:56] HE HAS A LETTER,
[2:16:58] A LETTER THAT SPEAKS ABOUT HIM.
[2:17:02] HE IS A MYSTERY
[2:17:04] IN A LETTER TO PHILIP.
[2:17:08] HE HAS TO KNOW
[2:17:10] WHAT THE LETTER SAYS CONCERNING HIM
[2:17:15] AND THAT WILL SHAPE HIS CHARACTER.
[2:17:23] Remember the letter is sealed
[2:17:27] but TO
[2:17:31] an open book.
[2:17:39] TO ONESIMUS.
[2:17:41] The seals have BEEN BROKEN
[2:17:44] TO ONESSIMUS.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; SHE'S NO LONGER in Ludicia.
[2:17:51] SHE HAS PICKED THE EYES OUT [screaming]
[2:17:54] and his eyes ARE
[2:17:58] HE CAN SEE.
[2:18:00] I AM NO LONGER A SLAVE.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; I AM BEGOTTEN OF PAUL.
[2:18:05] [screaming] I AM ENJOYED.
[2:18:09] So my new IDENTIFICATION
[2:18:12] is not in relation WITH THE PAST.
[2:18:16] SO AS HE IS GOING,
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING with a new song.
[2:18:23] [cheering]
[2:18:24] Are you SEEING WHAT I'M SAYING?
[2:18:26] AS WE ARE GOING TO GOD,
[2:18:29] THE BIBLE HAS BEEN SEALED
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; TO THE DENOMINATIONS.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; BUT TO ONESSIMUS,
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THIS BIBLE.
[2:18:42] I AM INSIDE THE BIBLE.
[2:18:44] I AM TYPED IN ONESIMUS.
[2:18:47] I am TYPED IN DAVID.
[2:18:50] I AM TYPED IN ESTHER.
[2:18:52] I AM TYPED IN THIS ONE.
[2:18:55] I HAVE TEDD IN THAT.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; SO AS I AM GOING BACK TO MY FATHER,
[2:19:00] I KNOW [screaming]
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; I AM CARRYING THE DNA.
[2:19:07] [applause]
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; So you can imagine ON
[2:19:15] CARRYING A LETTER
[2:19:17] that has declared his freedom.
[2:19:21] But then he's CARRYING THE LETTER.
[2:19:26] WHERE AM I EVEN going to stay?
[2:19:29] No. How am I even going to repay
[2:19:32] for all that I owe him?
[2:19:35] If the seal has been broken TO HIM,
[2:19:40] HE KNOWS
[2:19:44] HE'S WALKING.
[2:19:47] HOW WILL I pay?
[2:19:49] Yeah. I I I took away his clothes. I
[2:19:52] took away the shoes
[2:19:54] and I spent all of them in.
[2:19:58] I spent all of them with women.
[2:20:01] What am I going to do? That is somebody
[2:20:05] to whom the seals have not been.
[2:20:12] BUT IF ONESIMA
[2:20:15] HAS READ THE CONTENTS OF THE
[2:20:18] SINS HAVE BEEN BROKEN,
[2:20:20] HE KNOWS [screaming] THE DEBT HAS
[2:20:23] ALREADY BEEN PAID.
[2:20:26] HE KNOWS PAUL HAS ALREADY SAVED.
[2:20:30] PUT IT ON MY [screaming]
[2:20:33] ON MY ACCOUNT.
[2:20:36] HE'S NO LONGER A SLAVE
[2:20:38] TO FEAR.
[2:20:40] HE'S NO LONGER A SLAVE
[2:20:43] TO SIN. HE'S NO LONGER A SLAVE TO THE
[2:20:46] PAST. [screaming] HE'S NO LONGER A SLAVE
[2:20:49] TO THE VOICE OF THE ENEMY BECAUSE THE
[2:20:52] LETTER [screaming]
[2:20:53] HAS GIVEN HIM IDENTIFICATION.
[2:20:58] This is the real you.
[2:21:04] [cheering]
[2:21:05] Hallelujah. HOW MANY OF US
[2:21:08] HAVE ALLOWED THE DEVIL
[2:21:10] TO GIVE US A PICTURE
[2:21:13] THAT is contrary TO WHO WE ARE.
[2:21:17] THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE.
[2:21:19] GOD'S GRACE TO US HAS REWRITTEN OUR
[2:21:25] has broken the SEALS OF OUR LIVES AND
[2:21:28] HAS MADE US KNOW WE WERE RAISED IN THE
[2:21:30] CHICKEN.
[2:21:33] You were raised AMONG THE CHICKEN.
[2:21:36] BUT THE EYES [screaming]
[2:21:38] HAVE BEEN QUICKENED.
[2:21:40] OUR EYES OF UNDERSTANDING HAVE BEEN
[2:21:41] OPENED.
[2:21:43] OUR [screaming] EYES OF UNDERSTANDING
[2:21:44] HAVE BEEN OPENED.
[2:21:47] AND WE CAN SEE
[2:21:49] WINGS. [snorts]
[2:21:51] Just like MAMA EAGLE.
[2:21:54] [screaming] A BIG
[2:21:56] JUST LIKE MAMA EAGLES. [laughter]
[2:21:58] WINGS. THE OLD TESTAMENT
[2:22:02] AND THE NEW TESTAMENT TO FLY. WHEN THE
[2:22:06] STORMS COME, THE HIGHER WE GO, WE ARE
[2:22:10] NOT AFRAID OF [screaming] THE STORMS.
[2:22:12] WE HAVE GOT OUR IDENTIFICATION.
[2:22:15] WHEN THE STORMS COME AND THE CHICKEN IS
[2:22:18] THERE,
[2:22:21] let us go. Let us go. It is about to
[2:22:24] rain. IT'S ABOUT TO RAIN. WE HAVE
[2:22:26] REALIZED WHO WE ARE. WE ARE EAGLES. WE
[2:22:31] STRETCH FURTHER AWAY.
[2:22:35] CLAP [screaming] TWICE AND OFF WE GO.
[2:22:38] AND THE HIGHER WE GO,
[2:22:41] THE BETTER WE SEE. THE
[2:22:47] HIGHER WE [screaming] GO, THE PROMISES
[2:22:49] WE COME TRUE.
[2:22:51] THE LONGER I SERVE HIM, HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:55] THE LONGER I SERVE HIM, THE SWEETER HE
[2:22:58] GROWS,
[2:23:00] THE MORE I KEEP [screaming] ON FLYING,
[2:23:03] THE MORE I REALIZE
[2:23:05] THERE IS MORE LAND TO POSSESS.
[2:23:08] [screaming] THERE IS MORE HOLY GHOST.
[2:23:11] THERE IS MORE REVELATION.
[2:23:13] THERE IS MORE POWER. [screaming]
[2:23:15] THERE IS MORE ANOINTING. THERE IS MORE
[2:23:18] BLESSING. THERE IS MORE BREAKTHROUGH
[2:23:21] BECAUSE I KEEP [screaming] ON FLYING. I
[2:23:24] KNOW WHO I AM.
[2:23:25] I AM NOT A CHICKEN. I HAVE MY
[2:23:28] IDENTIFICATION.
[2:23:30] I HAVE seen [screaming] my ego.
[2:23:33] This is who I am.
[2:23:37] And I can TELL THE DEVIL,
[2:23:40] DEVIL, WATCH OUT.
[2:23:44] YOU'RE coming to MY THOUGHTS.
[2:23:47] ALL I NEED TO DO. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO
[2:23:51] DEBATE WITH YOU
[2:23:54] WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I'LL KEEP ON
[2:23:56] FLYING.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; I'LL KEEP ON FLYING.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; I'LL KEEP ON FLYING WHERE THIS BODY WILL
[2:24:04] NOT HOLD. [screaming]
[2:24:06] AMEN.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO JESUS.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; I'LL KEEP ON FLYING
[2:24:11] WHERE THIS BODY WILL NOT HOLD ME
[2:24:14] ANYMORE.
[2:24:16] WHERE THIS [screaming] BODY WILL SPEAK
[2:24:18] IN TONG
[2:24:20] WILL PROPHESY
[2:24:22] WILL BE QUICKENED
[2:24:24] IN THE HANDS OF THE SICK
[2:24:26] AND THEY RECOVER.
[2:24:30] [cheering]
[2:24:31] Are you seeing where we are?
[2:24:35] This is our place.
[2:24:42] Not to allow
[2:24:46] the enemy to preach TO US
[2:24:49] ANYTHING CONTRARY
[2:24:52] from what we have received.
[2:24:59] Have you forgotten?
[2:25:02] Take a peek at the letter.
[2:25:06] Take a PEEK AT THE LETTER.
[2:25:08] IS THE JANITOR
[2:25:11] ARE YOU CLIMBING MOUNTAINS?
[2:25:13] TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WHAT DOES THE
[2:25:15] LETTER SAY? THE LETTER [screaming]
[2:25:18] HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY GRACE
[2:25:21] AND GRACE HAS REWRITTEN MY STORY.
[2:25:28] HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:29] AMEN. You love the Lord Jesus.
[2:25:33] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; So we see
[2:25:40] He was not profitable.
[2:25:44] But now with a full revelation of what
[2:25:47] his name is,
[2:25:52] he is quickened.
[2:25:54] The meaning of that name can now be
[2:25:57] seen.
[2:25:59] Let me tell you saints. We are the
[2:26:02] onesimus of these things. People that
[2:26:05] are ordained to be profitable,
[2:26:09] profitable in the kingdom of God,
[2:26:12] to be profitable in their assemblies,
[2:26:15] to be profitable in your family,
[2:26:17] to be profitable in your school,
[2:26:20] to be profitable YOUR PLACE OF GOD.
[2:26:23] THIS IS WHAT GOD HAS ORDAINED.
[2:26:26] Let's cry.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; And then he says something that is so
[2:26:34] amazing.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; You know, receive ones on receive ones
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; as myself.
[2:26:48] Do not regard Onesimus
[2:26:52] as a slave. Regard him as a brother.
[2:26:57] and not just regard him as a bride,
[2:27:01] but when you see him,
[2:27:03] see melle.
[2:27:06] Hallelujah.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; I want that to sink.
[2:27:13] We can be Christians with partiality
[2:27:15] sometimes.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; That we regard this one better than the
[2:27:23] other one.
[2:27:28] until you realize we have classes.
[2:27:36] There's a class of those who drive.
[2:27:40] There's a class of those who wear suits.
[2:27:44] There's a class that lives in certain
[2:27:46] areas.
[2:27:49] And when church is over,
[2:27:52] the different classes meet up.
[2:28:02] When you're meeting the brother of your
[2:28:04] class
[2:28:11] and the anointing is so
[2:28:16] and of the other class,
[2:28:23] we actually even have another style back
[2:28:25] home
[2:28:27] where you don't even greet the brother
[2:28:28] well.
[2:28:30] You actually do like this
[2:28:33] and you actually go
[2:28:40] but the messenger of the age said
[2:28:44] if you see him
[2:28:46] receive him the way you will receive.
[2:28:52] [applause]
[2:28:54] I just want us to reflect on this a bit.
[2:28:58] You remember the prodigal son.
[2:29:00] You know after the prodical son came
[2:29:02] back
[2:29:04] you know the elder brother had a lot of
[2:29:06] bitterness.
[2:29:08] Take some time and read that story
[2:29:12] because he was like father you mean to
[2:29:14] tell me
[2:29:16] I've been with you all this time.
[2:29:20] You've never been slain for me.
[2:29:24] nothing
[2:29:26] but now this your son after he has
[2:29:29] squandered all THE MONEY
[2:29:31] HE'S coming and you're even killing the
[2:29:34] father
[2:29:36] what are you trying to show here father
[2:29:39] praise the name of the lord Jesus
[2:29:42] there are people who are like that in
[2:29:43] the king
[2:29:49] but can I tell you something
[2:29:52] this This is what the difference was.
[2:29:55] The elder son
[2:29:58] was a son
[2:30:00] but with a slave mentality.
[2:30:07] I really wish I I really wish I had the
[2:30:08] time to drink.
[2:30:12] When the son When the prodical SON IS
[2:30:14] COMING,
[2:30:16] HE does not realize the brother has
[2:30:18] come.
[2:30:22] When the feast is being planned,
[2:30:25] he does not realize what is happening.
[2:30:28] Because remember the place of a son is
[2:30:30] beside the father.
[2:30:35] But all THIS TIME
[2:30:38] HE IS with the servants in the field.
[2:30:43] Yes sir. Yes.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; Actually when he even comes BACK HOME
[2:30:49] HE DOES NOT go to the father oneonone.
[2:30:53] He sends another servant.
[2:30:56] Go check what he's having.
[2:31:00] Are you getting a mentality?
[2:31:06] So when he's telling the father why are
[2:31:08] you doing this?
[2:31:11] And the father gives a very strange
[2:31:13] answer.
[2:31:16] You have been with me all this time.
[2:31:22] But your brother, he was once lost and
[2:31:24] now he's found.
[2:31:27] This is how I understand that scripture.
[2:31:30] What the father is trying to tell this
[2:31:32] son.
[2:31:34] You have been with me all this time.
[2:31:37] Yet you are not realizing
[2:31:41] that you are actually my son.
[2:31:46] You are blaming me
[2:31:48] for not giving YOU A KID
[2:31:52] to celebrate with your friends.
[2:31:55] Don't you realize
[2:31:57] that as my SON
[2:32:00] WHAT I HAVE
[2:32:03] is yours. SO IF YOU WANTED IT,
[2:32:08] ALL YOU HAD TO DO
[2:32:11] [screaming] WAS TAKE IT.
[2:32:14] HALLELUJAH.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing amnesia?
[2:32:25] The devil gets you catched up in a POINT
[2:32:29] where you can be so fundamental and
[2:32:31] everything ELSE
[2:32:36] but you're still living under privilege.
[2:32:41] BECAUSE IF YOU WANTED A KID,
[2:32:48] YOUNG MAN, EVEN IF YOU TOOK 10
[2:32:52] I WILL EVEN REALIZE IT
[2:32:55] BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE IS YOURS.
[2:32:57] [screaming]
[2:32:59] HALLELUJAH.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; SUNSHIP.
[2:33:05] SUNSHIP. [screaming]
[2:33:08] This is where God has PLACED US.
[2:33:11] [screaming] THIS IS where God has put
[2:33:13] us.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Do you see it?
[2:33:20] How underprivileged have you been
[2:33:21] living?
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Are you in a place where you find that I
[2:33:29] don't think I'm I'm even worth it.
[2:33:33] I just feel like I'm worthless.
[2:33:37] You try to think that Christ would have
[2:33:38] died for you.
[2:33:42] And the journey becomes so hard for you.
[2:33:47] There was this man
[2:33:49] There was just an old bum.
[2:33:55] You know, a bum is someone who doesn't
[2:33:56] have a place to live.
[2:34:01] He's just living out in the streets.
[2:34:03] And it happened that one time. This old
[2:34:06] bum was was you know he was uh he got
[2:34:08] involved in an accident
[2:34:11] and he got so injured and mangled up
[2:34:16] and it got to a place where now uh he
[2:34:19] had been taken to hospital
[2:34:22] and the doctors were there thinking
[2:34:25] what can we do for this man
[2:34:28] because his case is so difficult
[2:34:31] I don't think we can be able to
[2:34:32] undertake it
[2:34:34] and when he was just there. His arms had
[2:34:37] been broken, his ribs were broken, the
[2:34:40] legs were broken.
[2:34:42] He was in such a bad condition
[2:34:45] and it appeared as if he was
[2:34:46] unconscious.
[2:34:49] Maybe that might be your condition.
[2:34:52] But I'm here to tell you,
[2:34:54] God specializes
[2:34:57] in things important.
[2:35:00] Do you feel like you've drifted?
[2:35:03] I'VE DRIFTED SO FAR.
[2:35:05] I'VE DRIFTED SO much in my prayer life.
[2:35:09] I've drifted so much in my consecration
[2:35:10] life.
[2:35:12] I don't even KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.
[2:35:15] I'VE JUST BEEN LIVING a life of
[2:35:16] formality.
[2:35:19] God specializes
[2:35:21] in mending the broken piece.
[2:35:26] Pick up the broken pieces
[2:35:29] and bring them to the Lord.
[2:35:31] So he was there unconscious.
[2:35:35] And the doctor the doctors are
[2:35:36] discussing
[2:35:38] and now what do we do and they arrived
[2:35:41] at a conclusion
[2:35:43] that it is not worth it. We will spend a
[2:35:46] lot of time
[2:35:51] trying to fix him up
[2:35:54] all the surgeries and all that.
[2:35:57] It will take a lot of money and a lot of
[2:36:00] resources.
[2:36:02] and they just decided
[2:36:04] it is not worth it.
[2:36:10] And you may have gone through the storms
[2:36:11] of life.
[2:36:14] The devil may have mangled you up.
[2:36:18] disappointments may have come your way
[2:36:21] and emotions
[2:36:24] and you end up so broken
[2:36:28] and you just start feeling so worthless
[2:36:33] and you feel oh I don't think there's
[2:36:34] any hope for me
[2:36:38] but as these doctors were making this
[2:36:39] disease
[2:36:42] it actually happened that he was not
[2:36:44] just as maybe near to death as they had
[2:36:46] thought
[2:36:51] because as they were there and saying no
[2:36:52] I don't think we can be able to do
[2:36:54] anything about this
[2:36:58] he gathered up his courage
[2:37:01] and he said hey doctor just a minute
[2:37:04] I've heard what you've said
[2:37:07] that I'm not worth your time
[2:37:10] I'm not worth this and that or that
[2:37:14] all right but I want to tell you
[2:37:16] something. I am worth something.
[2:37:21] I am worth the life of the Lord Jesus
[2:37:24] Christ.
[2:37:27] HE LEFT HEAVEN
[2:37:29] TO COME AND DIE for me. And I'm here to
[2:37:32] tell you, my brother, my sister,
[2:37:35] the stones of life may have left in such
[2:37:37] a bad place,
[2:37:40] but I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE SOMETHING
[2:37:43] BECAUSE IN REVELATION 5,
[2:37:46] THERE WAS A COUNCIL THAT WAS HELD
[2:37:50] AND GOD ASKED.
[2:37:52] WHO IS WORTHY [screaming]
[2:37:54] TO TAKE THE BOOK? WHO IS WORTHY TO BREAK
[2:37:58] THE SEALS?
[2:38:00] THE QUESTION WAS,
[2:38:02] WHO IS WORTHY? AND NO ONE WAS WORTHY.
[2:38:06] AND JOHN WAS THERE BEATEN UP,
[2:38:10] ALL BROKEN,
[2:38:12] REALIZING THAT ALL WAS LOST,
[2:38:15] BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN, ONE OF THE ELDERS
[2:38:18] SAID, "WEEP NOT." AND I'M HERE TO TELL
[2:38:22] YOU, YOU [screaming] HAVE SUFFERED.
[2:38:25] YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH STUFF, BUT THE
[2:38:28] TIME HAS COME.
[2:38:30] WEEP [screaming] NOT THE SEASON OF
[2:38:32] WEEPING.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord is upon me now.
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; The season of WEEPING
[2:38:52] has come to an end.
[2:38:57] HALLELUJAH.
[2:38:59] HOW has it come to AN END?
[2:39:02] BECAUSE THERE IS ONE
[2:39:04] THAT IS WORTH.
[2:39:07] THERE IS [screaming] ONE
[2:39:09] THAT HAS THE POWER TO REWRITE YOUR
[2:39:12] STONE. [screaming] THERE IS ONE THAT HAS
[2:39:16] THE POWER TO CHANGE YOUR SITUATION.
[2:39:19] [screaming] GOD SPECIALIZES
[2:39:22] IN THINGS THAT IMPOSSIBLE.
[2:39:25] WILL DO
[2:39:27] WHAT NO OTHER POWER DO.
[2:39:30] WE SING A SONG
[2:39:32] CALLED ANY MOUNTAINS
[2:39:35] YOU CAN'T tunnel through.
[2:39:42] God is either going to give you a tunnel
[2:39:44] in the mountain.
[2:39:48] He gives you the power to climb the
[2:39:50] MOUNTAIN
[2:39:53] or the wings of an eagle to fly above
[2:39:55] the mountain.
[2:40:00] You know what else?
[2:40:02] He can also GIVE YOU THE POWER
[2:40:05] TO SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN AND CAST IT
[2:40:08] INTO THE SEA
[2:40:10] THAT THE GOD WE SERVE
[2:40:14] GOT ANY RIVERS
[2:40:16] THAT ARE UNCROSSABLE.
[2:40:20] THERE'S A river before you and it is
[2:40:24] REFUSING TO PASS
[2:40:26] for you to walk.
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; Don't worry.
[2:40:30] ASK FOR POWER.
[2:40:33] YOU KNOW TO do what?
[2:40:35] To walk on water. [laughter]
[2:40:38] HALLELUJAH.
[2:40:47] AMEN. GRACE
[2:40:50] HAS ALREADY REWROTE YOUR LIFE.
[2:40:53] YOU ARE AN OVERCOMER. [screaming]
[2:40:55] [applause]
[2:40:59] What a wonderful THING
[2:41:02] TO GO INTO BATTLE
[2:41:04] TO KNOW THAT I'M ALREADY A WINNER.
[2:41:08] TO GO INTO A FIGHT
[2:41:10] TO KNOW THAT THE VICTORY
[2:41:14] listen
[2:41:15] I am not going to get the victory
[2:41:20] remember that song I went TO
[2:41:25] does it say I am going to the enemy's
[2:41:26] camp
[2:41:31] I am going to the enemy's camp
[2:41:36] I ALREADY WENT [screaming]
[2:41:38] AND I TOOK BACK.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; SO MINE IS TO EXERCISE.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; MINE [screaming]
[2:41:46] IS TO CATCH A REVELATION
[2:41:49] OF WHAT IS IN THE LETTER
[2:41:52] TO EXERCISE MYSELF ACCORDING TO IT
[2:41:59] TO [screaming] REALIZE I AM ALREADY A
[2:42:02] SON.
[2:42:04] [cheering]
[2:42:06] And he said,
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; "I am worth something.
[2:42:13] I am worth
[2:42:15] the life
[2:42:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[2:42:20] And that is what you're worth, my
[2:42:21] brother.
[2:42:24] And you see, when you know your wife,
[2:42:28] you know you're a partaker
[2:42:31] of what Adam lost.
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; You know you're a partaker.
[2:42:36] of redemption.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him this morning?
[2:42:44] [applause]
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; Luke 10:30.
[2:42:55] And before we get to Luke chapter 10,
[2:42:59] as the brother is opening it up,
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; you can just read one word by one word,
[2:43:04] my brother. No problem.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; There was this man by the name of
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; meisph.
[2:43:13] [laughter]
[2:43:24] It's a bit of a tongue twister.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord Jesus.
[2:43:30] I'm
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; just giving him some time to open Luke
[2:43:32] chapter 10.
[2:43:38] This was a time when David
[2:43:41] has ascended
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; into kingship.
[2:43:49] And you see David
[2:43:52] has ascended into kingship.
[2:43:55] Saul is dead.
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; Jonathan is dead.
[2:44:01] The entire family of Saul
[2:44:04] has already been killed in battle.
[2:44:07] And then David
[2:44:09] asks a question to one of his servants.
[2:44:14] And he asks the servants,
[2:44:16] "Is there anyone
[2:44:20] of the family of Saul
[2:44:23] that might be alive?"
[2:44:26] Because I want TO SHOW KINDNESS.
[2:44:31] TO THE FAMILY OF SAUL.
[2:44:34] And one of the servants said
[2:44:38] that Jonathan has a son.
[2:44:42] Who was Jonathan?
[2:44:44] Jonathan was a friend to David.
[2:44:47] You can put this down if you would want
[2:44:48] to read it later. In the book of second
[2:44:50] Samuel,
[2:44:55] Jonathan was a friend to David.
[2:44:59] and he had a son.
[2:45:02] There was just one issue with the son.
[2:45:07] The son was lame on his
[2:45:14] but he was a son to Jonathan.
[2:45:18] He was a son.
[2:45:20] So David says, you know, go go bring
[2:45:23] them forth
[2:45:25] and me is brought
[2:45:28] He bows his face before the king
[2:45:32] and identifies himself and said, "Oh,
[2:45:34] your servant is here."
[2:45:38] And David says unto him, "Fear not
[2:45:41] because I am going to show you kindness
[2:45:45] for Jonathan your father's
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; because
[2:45:55] your father was my friend.
[2:46:00] And you see the Bible says that David
[2:46:03] loved Jonathan as his own.
[2:46:08] The identification and the connection
[2:46:10] between Jonathan
[2:46:17] is what made me
[2:46:21] a partaker.
[2:46:24] our association
[2:46:28] with this message. Saints
[2:46:34] for Jonathan's sake,
[2:46:38] I
[2:46:40] will show you kindness.
[2:46:44] YOU ARE A SON OF JONATHAN, my friend.
[2:46:50] So stop regarding yourself AS A SERVANT.
[2:46:53] From
[2:46:55] today
[2:46:56] you will eat
[2:46:58] at my table.
[2:47:02] Who eats at the king's table?
[2:47:06] The family of the king.
[2:47:09] So from today
[2:47:12] you are a son in my house.
[2:47:20] You mean me?
[2:47:23] I am not looking at your condition.
[2:47:27] I am looking
[2:47:29] at your ASSOCIATION
[2:47:35] with my friend.
[2:47:38] Was Abraham
[2:47:40] a friend of God?
[2:47:42] Was Branham a friend of God?
[2:47:47] Yes, he was afraid of God until one day
[2:47:51] God asked him, "Why don't you walk with
[2:47:53] me?" Hallelujah.
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; SO [clears throat] BY ASSOCIATION,
[2:48:02] HERE COMES
[2:48:05] He's lame. You know, HE'S JUST DRAGGING
[2:48:08] HIMSELF UP.
[2:48:10] HE'S struggling
[2:48:13] trying TO MAKE THROUGH.
[2:48:16] BUT [screaming] WHERE IS HE HEADED?
[2:48:19] &gt;&gt; HE'S HEADED
[2:48:21] &gt;&gt; IN THE SEAT
[2:48:24] at the king's TABLE
[2:48:28] BECAUSE HE HAS A POSITION,
[2:48:31] REVELATION 3
[2:48:34] FROM VERSE 20 GOING DOWNWARDS.
[2:48:37] AND TO HIM THAT OVERCOMES
[2:48:41] WILL I GRANT THE RIGHT [screaming]
[2:48:44] TO SIT WITH ME
[2:48:46] IN MY THRONE
[2:48:49] JUST AS I OVERCAME
[2:48:52] AND SAT ON MY FATHER'S THRONE?
[2:48:55] HERE comes my
[2:48:58] LAME
[2:49:00] DRAGGING HIMSELF. [screaming]
[2:49:02] WHAT IS HE LOOKING AT?
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; IS HE LOOKING AT HIS FEET?
[2:49:08] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; HE'S LOOKING AT THE SEAT.
[2:49:12] ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK AT YOUR CONDITION?
[2:49:15] ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK AT YOUR
[2:49:16] CIRCUMSTANCE?
[2:49:19] [screaming] LOOK TO JESUS.
[2:49:22] LOOK TO THE THRONE.
[2:49:24] LOOK TO THE THRONE.
[2:49:28] HALLELUJAH.
[2:49:32] You will eat
[2:49:34] at the king's table.
[2:49:37] Ah hallelujah.
[2:49:38] &gt;&gt; BY FRIENDSHIP
[2:49:41] you will partake of the third bull
[2:49:44] ministry. HALLELUJAH.
[2:49:48] What is SERVED IN THE KING'S TABLE?
[2:49:52] It's a seven COURSE MEAL
[2:49:56] WHERE YOU'RE GROWING FROM FAITH TO
[2:49:58] VIRTUE
[2:50:00] INTO THE STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN.
[2:50:04] YOU CAN BE ABLE TO HOLD THE SWORD OF THE
[2:50:06] SPIRIT
[2:50:08] AND BY FAITH. YOU CAN SAY LET THERE BE
[2:50:13] AND YOU CAN SAY
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; I HALLELUJAH [screaming]
[2:50:18] THE SPOKEN WORD
[2:50:20] SPEAKS INTO EXISTENCE
[2:50:22] AND SPEAKS OUT OF EXISTENCE.
[2:50:25] [screaming] YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR FAMILY
[2:50:27] AND SAY IN MY HOUSE
[2:50:30] NONE OF MY CHILDREN. [screaming]
[2:50:32] I'M GOING TO GET LOST. HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:50:37] [applause and cheering]
[2:50:38] AM I SPEAKING TO PRAYING MOTHERS?
[2:50:42] I'M SPEAKING TO PRAYING MOTHERS.
[2:50:44] YOU CAN HAVE YOUR WEAKNESSES,
[2:50:47] BUT LOOK TO THE THRONE [screaming]
[2:50:49] AND SIT AT THE KING'S TABLE
[2:50:52] AND START DINING
[2:50:54] AND START DINING
[2:50:56] AND SPEAK. [screaming]
[2:50:58] [applause and cheering]
[2:51:00] OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:51:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; Let's finish with this.
[2:51:11] Grace rewrote the STORY OF MIBIA.
[2:51:16] FROM A LAME MAN
[2:51:18] TO HAVING A POSITION
[2:51:21] AT THE king's table.
[2:51:24] One thing about our king,
[2:51:28] HE DOES NOT LEAVE YOU
[2:51:30] TO BE LAME.
[2:51:32] This is what he does for us.
[2:51:35] And Jesus answering said,
[2:51:38] "A certain man went down from Jerusalem
[2:51:40] to Jericho
[2:51:42] and fell among it."
[2:51:45] These are things we know. We know that
[2:51:46] coming from Jerusalem to Jericho.
[2:51:50] It refers to a backsliden condition.
[2:51:55] It refers to how Onesimus came from the
[2:51:57] master
[2:52:01] in the wrong way. How you and I
[2:52:04] came to this world the wrong way and
[2:52:08] fell among thieves which stripped him of
[2:52:11] his reignment
[2:52:15] and wounded him and departed.
[2:52:22] When you stripped off your reignment,
[2:52:26] what is left?
[2:52:28] Shame.
[2:52:30] The shame of your nakedness is exposed.
[2:52:34] So he was left in a shameful condition
[2:52:38] and he's wounded.
[2:52:40] He cannot be able to do anything.
[2:52:42] And guilt puts you in a place where you
[2:52:45] cannot pray.
[2:52:48] Guilt puts you in a place where you
[2:52:51] cannot worship God with freedom of
[2:52:52] consciousness.
[2:52:55] Is someone with me?
[2:52:57] And departed leaving him half dead.
[2:53:01] And by chance there came down a certain
[2:53:03] priest that day.
[2:53:07] And when he saw him, he passed by and
[2:53:10] there was
[2:53:12] a priest.
[2:53:14] someone who was supposed
[2:53:16] to be an intercessor
[2:53:19] between God and man
[2:53:21] comes and finds him
[2:53:24] and he actually moves so far away from
[2:53:28] I don't want to be associated
[2:53:32] and likewise a Levite
[2:53:35] when he was at the place
[2:53:37] came and looked on him
[2:53:40] this one rode near
[2:53:45] the brother has really fallen.
[2:53:48] Hey, the sister has really fallen
[2:53:51] and he went on to the other side.
[2:53:54] These are characters we have
[2:53:58] and passed by the other side. But a
[2:53:59] certain Samaritan appeared,
[2:54:02] came where he was and when he saw him,
[2:54:06] he had compassion
[2:54:09] on him.
[2:54:13] You see, the love of God
[2:54:16] is what drove him to give himself.
[2:54:20] And he continues to say
[2:54:24] and went to him.
[2:54:26] &gt;&gt; What did he do? Bound up his wounds.
[2:54:32] You see, on your journey
[2:54:34] to the king's table,
[2:54:37] there's a certain power that God gives
[2:54:38] you
[2:54:40] that you do not go there.
[2:54:44] struggling,
[2:54:46] falling and getting all the tough,
[2:54:50] he comes and heals you, patches you up,
[2:54:55] bound up his wounds,
[2:54:57] &gt;&gt; pouring in oil
[2:55:01] and wine.
[2:55:03] And what happens?
[2:55:05] And set him on his own beast.
[2:55:13] So the way he's going BACK
[2:55:17] is not how he came.
[2:55:20] Hallelujah.
[2:55:23] &gt;&gt; He, you know, beast signifies power.
[2:55:28] Oil is a type of the Holy Spirit.
[2:55:32] Wine stimulation of revelation.
[2:55:36] So God is bringing these ingredients
[2:55:40] to a people in a certain condition.
[2:55:43] He puts them
[2:55:45] on his own beast.
[2:55:50] &gt;&gt; The same power.
[2:55:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:58] &gt;&gt; This is what is at our disposal,
[2:56:00] friends.
[2:56:06] If we end up living lives that are under
[2:56:07] privilege,
[2:56:12] you can never put it on God.
[2:56:19] God has already done it.
[2:56:24] The story of your life has already been.
[2:56:30] But do you know
[2:56:33] will you live a life
[2:56:37] that patterns
[2:56:40] after what grace
[2:56:42] has written about
[2:56:47] and brought him to an inn
[2:56:49] and took care of him.
[2:56:53] And on the tomorrow when he departed, he
[2:56:54] took out two pens
[2:56:58] and gave them to the horse
[2:57:00] and said unto him, "Take care of him,
[2:57:05] and whatsoever thou spendest more
[2:57:09] when I come again,
[2:57:11] I will repay."
[2:57:15] If you had the time,
[2:57:18] we would have preached on this as well.
[2:57:23] But I just want us to see something as
[2:57:24] we meditate,
[2:57:27] as the musicians come.
[2:57:30] I want us to sing that song.
[2:57:34] If not for grace,
[2:57:36] &gt;&gt; amazing grace house with the sounds.
[2:57:43] Grace has rewritten our story.
[2:57:48] We know we are Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[2:57:52] We know we are sons and daughters of
[2:57:53] God.
[2:57:57] But does our life pattern after that?
[2:58:02] You've been
[2:58:04] living maybe with shame and guilt and
[2:58:05] all this kind of.
[2:58:09] But my purpose today
[2:58:11] was to show you that you have no reason
[2:58:15] to live under that shadowing
[2:58:20] because God
[2:58:22] has already rewritten your story.
[2:58:26] [music]
[2:58:28] Now, it doesn't have to be guilt and
[2:58:30] shame of maybe actions and wrongs that
[2:58:32] you've done.
[2:58:37] If you have that, if you have that God
[2:58:39] has still made a way,
[2:58:46] you can still be in a certain guilt and
[2:58:47] shame where
[2:58:51] you're living under privilege.
[2:58:57] You're not living as a son of God.
[2:59:02] And is there somebody that will say to
[2:59:03] today,
[2:59:07] Lord, I realize your grace on my
[2:59:11] realize what you've done
[2:59:14] and Lord, I come as we stand on our
[2:59:16] feet.
[2:59:19] Lord, I rededicate myself to you.
[2:59:23] Lord, just like Onesimus,
[2:59:26] give me more
[2:59:28] of what?
[2:59:30] OF WHAT?
[2:59:33] GIVE ME MORE OF WHAT YOU want concerning
[2:59:35] me.
[2:59:38] I want a full revelation
[2:59:41] of what your word says concerning.
[2:59:45] I want to live a life
[2:59:48] free from sin,
[2:59:50] free from oppression,
[2:59:52] free from shackle.
[2:59:55] This is what grace has done.
[2:59:58] Where will you be? [music]
[3:00:01] This message that we've received
[3:00:04] &gt;&gt; is a message of grace,
[3:00:15] but now I'm found.
[3:00:24] It would have been a hopeless [music]
[3:00:25] case.
[3:00:28] It would have just been an empty space.
[3:00:32] But say message
[3:00:35] gives us purpose.
[3:00:37] This message gives us identity.
[3:00:42] Maybe maybe you've not really KNOWN WHO
[3:00:44] YOU ARE
[3:00:46] AND YOU WANT TO CROWD, "OH GOD,
[3:00:50] HELP ME.
[3:00:51] I've seen a small glimpse,
[3:00:55] but Lord, I want to step before the
[3:00:57] mirror of the world
[3:01:00] and see it in plain view."
[3:01:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:01:09] escape
[3:01:14] an empty place.

[3:20:38] Amen.
[3:20:42] Amen. So uh like uh we uh I promised you
[3:20:47] uh last Sunday, today I would love to
[3:20:50] give you an overall update about the
[3:20:53] youth camp contributions.
[3:20:56] Uh just briefly uh you remember we
[3:20:59] decided to do this so that we can um uh
[3:21:03] reduce on the burden on our pastor. So
[3:21:07] uh right now uh we received the prayers
[3:21:10] which we believe would really be uh kind
[3:21:13] of somehow enough to take us through. Uh
[3:21:17] but I mentioned that [snorts] if you
[3:21:20] have not given in your pledge that is
[3:21:22] mostly um by the other category. was
[3:21:26] mostly by the youth who gave in these
[3:21:29] pledges that you come to me or brother
[3:21:31] Dan or brother Joel and you can give in
[3:21:34] your contribution then uh we are going
[3:21:38] to record it so we have not received
[3:21:40] anyone and time is closing in how many
[3:21:44] days brother Dan are we remaining with
[3:21:46] around 61 days that's approximately
[3:21:49] two month up to 9th January so kindly
[3:21:53] let us uh do our best and
[3:21:56] bring them in. So for those who pledged
[3:21:59] uh we agreed, you know, we can bring
[3:22:01] 5,000 uh 1,000, 2,000, uh 10,000, it
[3:22:06] would be enough. So uh I appreciate
[3:22:10] uh those who have uh given as much as
[3:22:13] 5,000. May God richly bless you. And uh
[3:22:17] would love to emphasize those who have
[3:22:19] not given in anything towards your
[3:22:22] pledge. kindly uh send it in. Uh there
[3:22:26] are those that I tried to reach out to
[3:22:28] in the course of the week and uh those
[3:22:31] that I have not uh anytime I'll be
[3:22:34] reaching out. So let's start uh the
[3:22:36] pledges coming. I want to appreciate
[3:22:38] those who have given in more uh and uh
[3:22:43] than their balance what they have given.
[3:22:46] If uh you are in the group, I'm usually
[3:22:48] posting um what you have given towards
[3:22:52] your pledge and the balance. So I would
[3:22:55] love to appreciate I would I'm not going
[3:22:57] to mention names but God really richly
[3:23:00] bless you. So um we paid the venue uh we
[3:23:05] paid a deposit to the venue which was 2
[3:23:08] million and uh right now uh the amount
[3:23:15] collected is two as of end of day
[3:23:18] yesterday it is uh uh 2 million765,000.
[3:23:26] So that means uh in cash we are having
[3:23:29] only 765,000.
[3:23:33] So
[3:23:35] and the amount that is
[3:23:38] not that has not been u sorry the figure
[3:23:41] is 2,815,000
[3:23:45] million.
[3:23:48] So and our total pledges were
[3:23:51] 13,360,000.
[3:23:54] So this means the amount that we have
[3:23:57] not cleared is 10,545,000.
[3:24:04] So we have not even got to nearly a
[3:24:07] quarter of what we pledged. So let us
[3:24:10] give in uh this week. Uh I appreciate
[3:24:14] last week it was some quite good time
[3:24:18] for those that gave in. God bless you
[3:24:21] once again. So uh this week I'll if I
[3:24:24] give you a call uh to remind you uh
[3:24:27] don't feel bad because uh we really need
[3:24:31] to pay some of the service providers and
[3:24:35] the rest. So that is the update. We
[3:24:39] having 800,000 for now uh which can't do
[3:24:42] anything. And uh once again uh this was
[3:24:45] a request from uh the pastor
[3:24:48] uh
[3:24:50] the I don't know I don't want to call
[3:24:53] them the the older people because no one
[3:24:55] here is old but those ones uh that are
[3:24:59] not the youth like we collected kindly
[3:25:02] send in uh the pledges because at least
[3:25:06] a church member we should not give
[3:25:09] something less than 100,000 others will
[3:25:12] be paying a camp fee of 50,000. So, uh
[3:25:16] if you're a church member, you should u
[3:25:20] give something that is more than
[3:25:22] 100,000. Briefly, one person will be
[3:25:26] paying will be spending us as the
[3:25:29] church, we are going to be spending
[3:25:31] about 70,000
[3:25:35] on each person that will be camping at
[3:25:38] the venue. um which makes it uh if uh
[3:25:42] these people come and pay 50 we shall be
[3:25:45] in a deficit of 20,000. So that's the
[3:25:47] reason why us here we are few but uh you
[3:25:52] know we have never estimated our we have
[3:25:54] never underestimated ourselves and we
[3:25:56] will never so let us give in in that the
[3:26:00] 100 at least we can get uh the 20,000 to
[3:26:05] at least support one person one visitor
[3:26:08] that will be coming in. So God richly
[3:26:11] bless you uh brother Dan and brother Joe
[3:26:13] they'll be waiting for the pledges or
[3:26:16] the contribution for those that did not
[3:26:19] send them in. And if you're also part of
[3:26:21] the youth kindly uh reach out to us so
[3:26:25] that we can record it. Otherwise God
[3:26:28] richly bless you. I wish you a very uh
[3:26:32] nice Sunday and best for the rest of
[3:26:35] your week.
[3:26:40] My redeemer [singing]
[3:26:42] is faithful and true.
[3:26:49] Everything he said
[3:26:53] he will do.
[3:26:58] Every morning
[3:27:02] [singing and music]
[3:27:02] is on you.
[3:27:07] Our redeemer [singing]
[3:27:10] is faithful and true
[3:27:15] &gt;&gt; shall rise on our feet.
[3:27:21] Praise the Lord. We appreciate the
[3:27:24] minister for that.
[3:27:28] [applause]
[3:27:30] Brother Kane, God bless you so much. We
[3:27:33] are grateful and so glad to have you.
[3:27:36] Shall we bow our heads and we pray?
[3:27:39] Precious Lord Jesus, Father, we thank
[3:27:42] you for this moment. We thank you Lord
[3:27:44] for this day thou has spoken to our
[3:27:47] hearts. Lord,
[3:27:49] we thank you Lord Jesus Christ for being
[3:27:51] such a wonderful father that even this
[3:27:55] morning you have reminded us Lord
[3:27:57] [music]
[3:27:58] of where we came from and father of who
[3:28:00] we are. And Lord Jesus, we know that
[3:28:04] this is the message of the hour.
[3:28:07] For our prophet says that Lord, if the
[3:28:09] church will know who they are and
[3:28:13] father, what we stand for,
[3:28:16] that church be an invisible army. Heaven
[3:28:20] father, king of glory, we thank you for
[3:28:22] the vessel you have used this day. And
[3:28:26] we pray that Lord, may you bless your
[3:28:28] servant.
[3:28:29] May you refresh him. King of glory.
[3:28:33] We pray that may you continue using him
[3:28:35] in a mighty way. Lord Jesus,
[3:28:38] bless the Lady, King of Kings. Even the
[3:28:41] word that has been preached [music] this
[3:28:43] day, Father, for us here. May it not
[3:28:46] stop here, Lord Jesus, as your word
[3:28:48] tells us that we should not only be
[3:28:49] hearers of the word, but help us be
[3:28:53] doers of the word, Lord. For even in our
[3:28:56] nature, we cannot do without you. But we
[3:29:00] pray that Lord, may you come and be that
[3:29:02] faith in us, Lord Jesus. As you said in
[3:29:06] Psalms that the path of the righteous
[3:29:08] man is like a shining light that shines
[3:29:12] so brighter and brighter to the glory of
[3:29:15] the day. We pray that may this word
[3:29:19] increase our faith. Help us Lord Jesus
[3:29:24] even as we are leaving this place is our
[3:29:26] prayer and our desire that Lord you
[3:29:29] bless each one of us. You are the Lord
[3:29:32] of life ahead of us and you undo all the
[3:29:35] plants of the devil. May you go ahead of
[3:29:38] each one of us Lord Jesus. Remove all
[3:29:41] the barriers Lord the snares that the
[3:29:43] enemy has placed father in front of us
[3:29:45] Lord. May the pillar of fire this
[3:29:49] afternoon divide himself Lord by each
[3:29:52] one of us Lord Jesus Christ. Remember
[3:29:55] our pastor we trust Lord receive him
[3:29:58] this week Lord Jesus. We pray that may
[3:30:01] you give him the grace Lord to be safe
[3:30:05] back home Lord. Father King of Kings we
[3:30:08] pray for the ministers of this church
[3:30:10] and the entire body of Christ wherever
[3:30:13] they are. Father, we pray for the family
[3:30:15] of our brother Kennedy. Lord, may we
[3:30:18] pray that Lord, may you bless them as
[3:30:20] well and this fellowship, King of glory.
