[16:04] amen
[16:06] amen God bless you I have a we have a
[16:10] vis sister Winnie from
[16:13] Bala uh God bless you thank you for
[16:16] coming to be with us today we appreciate
[16:19] you so very much amen so we are going to
[16:23] the word in the book of Exodus if you
[16:25] could please turn to Exodus chapter 1
[16:30] God bless you musicians uh everyone with
[16:33] your Bible please turn to the Book of
[16:37] Exodus chapter
[16:42] 1 we are reading from verses
[16:54] 15 if you there Say
[16:57] Amen you
[17:00] there
[17:02] amen so we are reading from verses 15 to
[17:05] vers
[17:08] 22 and the king of Egypt spake to the
[17:12] Hebrew midwives of which the name of the
[17:15] one was s cifra and the name of the
[17:19] other Po and he said when ye do the
[17:23] office of a midwife to the Hebrew women
[17:25] and see them upon the stools if be a son
[17:29] then he shall kill him but if it be a
[17:33] daughter then she shall
[17:36] live but the midwives feared God and did
[17:40] not did not as the king of Egypt
[17:43] commanded them but saved the men
[17:46] children
[17:48] alive and the king of Egypt called for
[17:51] The
[17:52] Midwives and said unto them why have you
[17:56] done this thing and have saved the man
[17:58] children
[18:01] alive and the Midwife said unto Pharaoh
[18:04] because the Hebrew women are not as the
[18:08] Egyptian women for they are Lively and
[18:11] are delivered before the midwives come
[18:13] in unto them I believe the Believers if
[18:17] you have receed if you you born again
[18:19] and you are a Believer and you a sister
[18:21] when it comes to delivery as much as it
[18:24] will not be easy just like it is not
[18:25] easy for everybody to deliver but God
[18:28] God usually gives Grace the Bible says
[18:30] in the book of First Timothy that he
[18:31] will give he will save them in
[18:33] childbearing or in child birth so women
[18:36] who are believers have that as a promise
[18:39] so sisters who are here you can say Amen
[18:40] to that you have that as a promise to
[18:42] deliver in child birth without
[18:44] complications it's your promise all
[18:47] right so then he says and therefore God
[18:50] dealt dealt well with the midwives and
[18:53] the people multiplied and works very
[18:56] Mighty I want to read that verse once
[18:58] again and it came to pass because the
[19:01] midwives feared God that he made them
[19:03] houses okay I wanted to read verse 20
[19:06] again therefore God dealt well with the
[19:09] midwives and the people
[19:14] multiplied therefore God dealt well with
[19:17] the midwives and the people multiplied
[19:20] why did the people
[19:22] multiply because the main children were
[19:25] kept alive amen all right
[19:29] and uh the and um and and works very
[19:32] Mighty so the people multiplied and
[19:34] worked very Mighty so if the men
[19:37] children can be kept alive the people
[19:39] must multiply the people of that race
[19:43] must multiply the people of that seed
[19:45] must multiply each of you Brothers you
[19:47] have a
[19:49] seed and I'm glad that this is not being
[19:51] interpreted tonight because I can follow
[19:53] my thought trajectory very well and and
[19:55] you two can follow me each of you has a
[19:57] seed within you a generation after you
[20:00] and you see if the devil gets you if the
[20:04] devil finishes if the devil accomplishes
[20:06] his purpose in your life then there is
[20:09] going to be a
[20:10] destruction and there will be no
[20:13] multiplication but there is going to be
[20:15] multiplication if you are kept alive can
[20:18] you say Amen to that
[20:20] brothers and then he says and it came to
[20:22] pass because the midwives feared God
[20:24] that that that he made them
[20:26] houses and pharaoh charged all his
[20:29] people saying every son that is born ye
[20:31] shall cast into the river and every
[20:34] daughter ye shall save alive blessed be
[20:36] the name of the Lord God bless you you
[20:38] may be
[20:49] seated excuse
[20:51] me I've been speaking quite a lot in the
[20:53] meeting there so I need a little break
[20:57] praise the name of the Lord

[22:02] occupy the the front seats yes I will
[22:04] appreciate that so very
[22:06] much thank you thank you thank you for
[22:11] cooperating okay I don't know why these
[22:13] days people fear front
[22:16] seats somehow people fear front seats
[22:19] don't you feel comfortable there on the
[22:21] front seat praise the name of the Lord
[22:24] so I'm speaking on the power of the Next
[22:26] Generation
[22:28] the power of the Next Generation friends
[22:30] there is this thing that is burning
[22:31] within me about the generation my
[22:35] generation Our Generation your
[22:38] generation no doubt we have had fathers
[22:42] and as I said before sisters that are
[22:44] part of this service today you are going
[22:46] to allow me to dedicate this service to
[22:49] the brothers is that
[22:52] amen yes so if you have children and
[22:54] they are uh Sons or if you have uh uh
[22:58] Brothers then this is for them you might
[23:00] want to send it to them but I want to
[23:02] say uh to you today that I have an
[23:06] immense burden on my heart about my
[23:08] generation because there there's a lot
[23:10] of things that I've been seeing around
[23:14] wherever I travel and even around in the
[23:17] fellowship here and even the people that
[23:19] I'm in contact with especially the the
[23:22] younger generation when I say the
[23:24] younger generation of course that is
[23:25] according to me because uh you will also
[23:28] say the younger generation so you know
[23:30] there is a generation that is younger
[23:32] than you so but I mean the generation of
[23:35] our time of course we are now in the
[23:38] 21st is it the 21st century so we we is
[23:42] it the one that is called Generation
[23:44] Z I'm not quite sure about that but I
[23:46] think there is this last generation the
[23:49] computer generation the WhatsApp
[23:51] generation uh the the phone smartphone
[23:54] generation that's the generation that we
[23:55] are living in of course I'm talking
[23:57] about you that is listening to me today
[24:01] so the internet generation the
[24:03] generation of the now and we see that
[24:06] there have been many whatever we are
[24:08] today that is positive has been partly
[24:11] because of the generations that have
[24:13] been there before us and whatever that
[24:15] we are that is negative has also been
[24:18] actually because of the generations that
[24:20] have been there before us you'll find
[24:22] that in each of us our individual lives
[24:24] that trials and things that we struggle
[24:26] with sometimes things that you struggle
[24:28] with and you have you have actually no
[24:30] solution for those things is partly
[24:33] because you may not know you may not
[24:34] even have known before but if you had a
[24:37] glimpse if God allowed you to have a
[24:39] glimpse on the generation before you
[24:41] maybe the generation of your father and
[24:42] you started the life of your father
[24:44] properly you will realize that many of
[24:47] the things that were passed down to you
[24:49] that maybe you do not want or things it
[24:52] might be a character it might be uh a
[24:55] lifestyle it might be things you know
[24:57] different things if you knew or had a
[24:59] chance to study your father you might
[25:01] realize that some of those things
[25:02] actually were passed down on to you and
[25:04] even the positive things as well you
[25:06] realize it was passed down onto you so
[25:09] there is a
[25:10] great power within a gen within you
[25:14] because now you are also going to
[25:16] influence the generation after you the
[25:19] generation that is coming after of
[25:20] course that is if the Lord terries we
[25:22] know that the Lord will is coming soon
[25:26] we believe that the Lord is coming on
[25:27] our generation but there is also a
[25:30] likelihood that he will he will T we do
[25:32] not know we are told to live as though
[25:35] he is coming
[25:37] today but to work as though he is coming
[25:41] tomorrow so you're not going to fold
[25:42] your hand and say I not do anything
[25:44] because the Lord is coming to tomorrow
[25:46] rather today because he's coming today
[25:48] I'm not going to work because he's
[25:50] coming today I'm not going to uh uh to
[25:52] plan for tomorrow because he coming
[25:54] today many people who believed and
[25:56] receiv received this message in the in
[25:57] the in the first years they did not
[25:59] actually
[26:00] work uh the pastors did not encourage
[26:03] their people to even contribute money
[26:05] for buying land and for building
[26:07] churches uh because they they were
[26:10] believing the Rapture was happening the
[26:12] next minute and that was true and still
[26:15] true today but it's been more than 50
[26:19] years since the messenger died and the
[26:22] Rapture has not yet happened so there is
[26:24] a possibility that the Rapture may not
[26:25] actually happen for the next 50 years
[26:27] but also there is a possibility that it
[26:30] might actually happen in the next
[26:32] moments from now so we do not know we
[26:34] want to Hoy our potatoes we want to
[26:36] plant trees we want to believe for big
[26:38] things but we also want to live as
[26:40] though the Lord was coming the next
[26:41] moment is that amen so but now we notice
[26:45] that there is power in there is the the
[26:48] power of the next generation is here
[26:53] with you with me the power of the
[26:55] generation that is coming next
[26:58] many people live in uh I've had somebody
[27:03] use the word Babble but I want to use
[27:06] that word in this sense that many people
[27:07] live in a bab believing
[27:09] that they they
[27:12] uh that life is is
[27:16] so so easy and that uh you know they
[27:20] have nothing to worry about and that
[27:22] life is just going around about them and
[27:24] U you know they just appeared and then
[27:27] they just disappear and that life will
[27:29] continue on and life will continue on
[27:31] another generation shall come and
[27:33] another generation shall go but I want
[27:35] to be one person who is going to believe
[27:37] that I'm not here just to leave and
[27:40] disappear I never appeared and I will
[27:42] not disappear I came from somewhere and
[27:44] I'm going somewhere when Jesus was on
[27:46] Earth he lived what I call a life of
[27:50] purpose because Jesus believed that the
[27:54] life he was living the life he had the
[27:57] life that he came down on Earth to live
[27:59] he was actually living that life for not
[28:02] himself but for the Next Generation
[28:05] which was coming after him and actually
[28:07] we are
[28:08] beneficiaries of the life that Jesus
[28:11] Christ
[28:11] lived if it wasn't for him then we would
[28:14] not have a life but you see the power of
[28:17] the next generation is also now with you
[28:22] whatever went wrong before you doesn't
[28:24] really count now it is what is going to
[28:27] go wrong wrong with you now there is
[28:29] something you can stop or there is
[28:31] something you can permit and give
[28:34] permission to pass you and go to another
[28:37] generation the power of the next
[28:39] generation is with you that's what I'm
[28:41] sharing with you tonight and we see here
[28:44] that the devil knows that the only way
[28:47] he can destroy the next generation is by
[28:49] killing Sons not daughters Sons I want
[28:53] you to notice that the devil knows that
[28:55] very well the power of the next
[28:57] generation is with
[29:00] sons not with daughters but with
[29:05] sons the reason for that is seed is in
[29:10] and with the sun it is a male
[29:14] child that moves the seed from one
[29:19] generation to another to another to
[29:21] another here in Africa for centuries uh
[29:26] parents did not use to allow their uh
[29:29] girl children to inherit their property
[29:32] because it was going to disappear it was
[29:35] you know it it had to be inherited by
[29:39] the by the male children because it is
[29:41] with them that seed was transferred from
[29:43] the generation of their father to
[29:45] another
[29:46] generation and so I want you to see
[29:48] brother bam here says in the message the
[29:49] resurrection of Lazarus it says it is
[29:52] just like the blood the bloodstream
[29:54] comes from the male sex we know know
[29:57] that the mother is just an incubator for
[30:00] the child and the mother's blood now
[30:02] some of you may not actually know this
[30:04] so listen to this and the mother's blood
[30:06] has nothing to do with the child at all
[30:10] did you know
[30:11] that only the doctor Dr mul knew that
[30:15] he's a medical doctor by the way someone
[30:17] told me maybe he's a nurse no brother
[30:19] mul is a professional full medical
[30:23] doctor is that correct brother how many
[30:25] years did you study in University to
[30:26] become a doctor 5 years fulltime doctor
[30:30] right and he is telling us that it is
[30:34] true the mother's blood has nothing to
[30:37] do with the child at all although it is
[30:40] born in the blood and the person who
[30:42] said this actually he's a he's a seventh
[30:44] grader he only went up to seventh grade
[30:47] and he can tell you things that a
[30:49] medical doctor will tell you he was
[30:51] supernaturally sent to by God to our
[30:53] generation and he says although it is
[30:55] born in the blood of the mother
[30:58] but it has nothing to do with it it has
[31:01] got one drop of the mother's blood it
[31:03] sorry it hasn't got one drop of the
[31:06] mother's blood in it it's the blood of
[31:08] the father and the life lays in the
[31:12] blood so God in his Sovereign wisdom
[31:15] placed the seed listen God in his
[31:17] Sovereign wisdom placed the seed of
[31:20] multiplication in the man not in the
[31:23] woman but in the man you notice that a
[31:26] man
[31:27] um uh the the seed when when a child is
[31:31] in the womb of the
[31:32] mother all the blood within the stream
[31:35] of the child is actually the father's
[31:38] blood no Speck of a mother's blood in
[31:40] there imagine it imagine it but the
[31:44] father's
[31:45] blood I want you to imagine
[31:47] that and so I want to show you that God
[31:50] in his Sovereign wisdom he placed the
[31:53] seed of multiplication the seed that
[31:56] would multiply the um uh the human race
[32:00] in mankind or in man in the male gene or
[32:06] male seed if only the devil can destroy
[32:09] the man the devil knows if I can destroy
[32:11] the
[32:13] man then he surely can destroy the Next
[32:15] Generation he will actually unhate
[32:19] remove completely destroy all the other
[32:22] Generations that will come after so now
[32:26] it is in the man it is in the man is in
[32:28] the boy it is in The Man Child let me
[32:31] put it that way that the seed of
[32:33] multiplication has been placed and
[32:35] that's why the devil tries hard so hard
[32:39] to lock up the male's
[32:43] Destiny the devil let me tell you the
[32:45] devil tries hard to
[32:48] destroy the destiny of a male child some
[32:53] of you of course will tell and can tell
[32:55] that there are some families
[32:57] that you if you come from that family
[32:59] they know you can have as many children
[33:02] as you want and they will all leave but
[33:04] when you have a male child that child
[33:07] will die how many have heard of that I
[33:09] see a hand back there another hand who
[33:12] else has heard of that oh you're
[33:13] privileged to come from a family that
[33:16] doesn't experience that or you've not
[33:18] heard of that but I'll tell you it's all
[33:20] over I've heard of it many many times
[33:23] they will tell you for for us in our
[33:25] family we can have as many children as
[33:27] we want to have but when it comes to
[33:30] having male children they will either
[33:32] die in the stomach not yet born or they
[33:36] will actually not be born at all they
[33:38] they will they will they will be born
[33:40] dead or they will be born half dead you
[33:42] see because within the devil knows that
[33:46] you see that maybe of course it happens
[33:48] here in Africa because maybe because of
[33:50] Witchcraft and there is someone that did
[33:52] not want that that seed to multiply and
[33:56] then he would try to to place a cast on
[33:58] that family and then things happen that
[34:00] uh the male children will either not be
[34:02] born in other families other the girls
[34:05] can prosper but the boys cannot Prosper
[34:08] you see you know they will try all that
[34:10] they can but no prosperity for you as
[34:12] long as you are a male child you see
[34:15] whether it is witchcraft or what I want
[34:17] to tell you it is the devil okay it's
[34:19] the devil and the devil is targeting the
[34:22] M I'm going to show you here I'm going
[34:24] if you give me time and your attention I
[34:26] trust that this will be a blessing to
[34:27] you by the time we are done he says that
[34:30] is why the devil tries hard to lock up
[34:33] the male's Destiny and how does he lock
[34:36] it up he locks It Up by burying it in
[34:38] Toms several Toms the devil has laid or
[34:41] dug Toms Toms of uh several things that
[34:44] he will try to and I'll show it to you
[34:47] and once I show it to you you will see
[34:48] clearly that that's the truth he will
[34:51] try to uh bury them in the TBS of
[34:53] immoral living that's one of the devices
[34:56] the devil used es he will he will take
[34:59] he will take the boys and the the the
[35:01] gentleman or the the the men he will
[35:05] bury them in the terms of immoral living
[35:07] and others he will take them and he will
[35:09] bury them in the terbs of drug
[35:12] abuse they are very yes I know they are
[35:15] prostitutes women prostitutes but when
[35:19] you if you want to count how many more
[35:23] people live in uh immoral living it's
[35:26] actually men more than women most women
[35:30] do not live immorally but men
[35:33] do men do and the devil wants to bury
[35:36] them there and and even when they
[35:39] married you'll find they still live in
[35:41] immoral actions because the devil wants
[35:43] to bury them in there and and uh very
[35:46] few women will be in drug abuse but the
[35:48] devil will Target men the devil wants
[35:51] men to abuse drugs so they can lose
[35:55] their mind so they can become mad so
[35:57] they can become crazy so that their mind
[36:00] will not function the way it is supposed
[36:02] to function and when he does that he has
[36:04] captivated them and he will keep them
[36:06] there and when I was leaving in Ethiopia
[36:09] at the time during the reign of Mel
[36:13] zwi who was um the prime minister of
[36:16] Ethiopia before two
[36:20] others
[36:21] he the people were saying because you
[36:23] see how many not chat chat
[36:27] chat chat
[36:29] yes yes AAA what is it called cut it's
[36:34] called cut okay now uh you see that is
[36:38] um is it weed it's not
[36:41] weed it it's called Kaka here so my I
[36:46] don't know what it is exactly but U you
[36:48] see that thing you know when you take it
[36:50] it the first thing it takes away from
[36:52] you is
[36:54] time because you really need a lot of
[36:57] time because you will need to chew it
[36:59] and you chew it like a go cuz you see
[37:01] you chew it and then you continue
[37:03] chewing and then you'll get gum and you
[37:05] continue chewing so you see at that time
[37:08] during that time there were many young
[37:10] people chew I don't know whether they
[37:11] chew it now in EOP like they used to
[37:13] chew it then but they were chewing it
[37:15] everywhere and it was legalized so it
[37:17] can be sold anywhere so everybody was
[37:19] just buying and chewing but you will
[37:20] find not girls or women but boys and men
[37:25] every corner you'll find them chewing
[37:27] chewing chewing putting G and chewing
[37:29] putting that is it leaves chewing
[37:32] chewing chewing chewing so you find
[37:33] their mouth you know like goats you know
[37:35] like when a goat is eating they are
[37:37] chewing they're chewing and uh then many
[37:40] times of course you find uh you know
[37:42] they are uh you know they're reading
[37:44] they're chewing they're driving they're
[37:46] chewing even drivers taxi drivers I'm
[37:49] not talking about the big taxi I'm
[37:51] talking about the contract taxi so
[37:53] imagine you contract a taxi we call it
[37:56] special here oh Uber and someone is
[38:00] chewing cat see chewing chewing chewing
[38:03] chewing Che until I ask somebody isn't
[38:05] this thing legal in this country said no
[38:08] anybody can chew so I asked one brother
[38:10] he said why is this thing legalized he
[38:11] said well if you you give the young
[38:14] people that thing they will be so busy
[38:17] that they will have no time for politics
[38:18] so the man was not troubled for over 30
[38:21] years because the young people were
[38:23] chewing everybody was busy chewing and
[38:26] the other thing that that was also
[38:27] legalized is alcohol it is that I found
[38:30] young men smoking young men are taking
[38:32] alcohol young young as young as 14 16
[38:36] they smoking and they they're drinking
[38:38] alcohol you know and the devil will
[38:41] legalize those things because H and even
[38:43] now in the world agenda they're trying
[38:45] to push for those things they're trying
[38:47] to push it to legalize it say it's okay
[38:49] to take weed it's okay to smoke it's
[38:51] okay let everybody have their
[38:53] rights and why because the devil is
[38:56] targeting the Next Generation imagine
[38:59] what kind of generation we are going to
[39:01] have after this one because this let me
[39:03] tell you our generation is the last s
[39:06] generation if the Lord carries the last
[39:08] s generation the next generation is
[39:11] going to go Bak is going to be a
[39:13] generation of
[39:14] Fools and only the generation that will
[39:17] come out of the people that fear the
[39:19] name of the Lord people that have amen
[39:22] kept themselves and they have realized
[39:24] The Power Within them and they have not
[39:25] allowed the devil to control them will
[39:27] be the only that generation will be the
[39:29] only generation that will fear will fear
[39:31] God and serve God I tell you what in
[39:34] Europe as I'm speaking to you now in
[39:36] Europe Christianity came of course from
[39:39] Israel and then all onto Europe and from
[39:43] Europe to
[39:44] Africa but now in Europe most of the
[39:49] churches are being sold of because you
[39:52] see there are no longer people there are
[39:53] many Church buildings in Europe that are
[39:55] free that are empty
[39:56] nobody's attending them nobody's
[39:59] attending church anymore and this is
[40:02] where they were very religious and
[40:04] attending Mass attending church you know
[40:06] doing baptisms doing many of these
[40:08] things as we know as we see them do it
[40:11] now in the big Cathedrals they have
[40:13] those big Cathedrals very many of them
[40:14] across Europe of course Europe is is
[40:16] large I'm talking about uh England I'm
[40:18] talking about Wales I'm talking about
[40:21] France I'm talking about all those
[40:23] places and you find that right now those
[40:26] places which used to be Church holy
[40:28] places as it were you find them right
[40:31] now they're putting uh discs the people
[40:36] buy it off and they sell it off and they
[40:37] put disects they put um you know G
[40:42] things people just go there to uh
[40:44] worship the devil literally you know in
[40:46] the places of worship Christianity
[40:49] Europe is no longer a Christian place
[40:52] people are being arrested even they if
[40:54] they find you preaching on the road they
[40:56] will arrest you because you see the
[40:58] generation that they have now is that
[41:01] generation which does not fear God at
[41:03] all which has taken God out of their
[41:05] minds if you read in the Book of Romans
[41:08] chapter 1 the Bible says they've become
[41:10] reprobates in their mind you know let me
[41:13] because they did not retain God I did
[41:15] not plan to read that but let me read
[41:16] that little portion there if you can
[41:18] open with me the book of Romans there
[41:20] something I want you to see there I
[41:22] realized I picked my wife's Bible and so
[41:25] it's not easy for me to open quicker
[41:30] quickly so here in the in Romans chapter
[41:35] 1 vers
[41:38] um it says for the wrath of God is vers
[41:41] 18 for the wrath of God is revealed
[41:44] against all un ungodliness and
[41:46] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[41:49] truth in
[41:50] unrighteousness because that which may
[41:53] be known of God is manifest
[41:57] in them for God has showed it unto them
[42:00] for the invisible things of him from the
[42:02] creation of the world are clearly seen
[42:04] being understood by the things that are
[42:05] made even his eternal power and godhead
[42:08] so that they are without excuse because
[42:11] that they knew God they glorified him
[42:13] not as God neither were thankful but
[42:16] became vain they became vain in their
[42:19] own imaginations and their foolish
[42:22] Hearts was darkened professing
[42:25] themselves to be wise they be fools and
[42:27] they Chang the glory of the
[42:29] uncorruptible god into an image made
[42:31] like to corruptible man and to birds and
[42:34] to four-footed beasts and creeping
[42:36] things so and and um and where because
[42:40] of that because of what they did what
[42:42] did God do God gave also to God gave
[42:46] them up to uncleanliness through the
[42:48] lust of their own Hearts to dishonor
[42:50] their own bodies between themselves and
[42:52] you will find that right now in in in
[42:54] Europe many will say oh no we are some
[42:58] of them are saying we are birds others
[42:59] saying we are sheep others they're
[43:00] saying we are this we are that imagine a
[43:02] human being in the morning saying I'm a
[43:05] dog and defend my rights I'm a dog a
[43:08] human being a full I'm not dreaming I'm
[43:11] telling you things that are happening
[43:12] some of you know it some of you don't
[43:13] know but I'm telling you this is
[43:15] happening in a a place where it used to
[43:17] be a Christian Nation is no longer a
[43:20] Christian Nation and let me tell you
[43:22] this was prophesied that it had to
[43:25] happen the cup of iniquity has to be
[43:27] full for the wrath of God to come down
[43:30] to the Earth do not think that God is
[43:32] just going to come and destroy the Earth
[43:34] just like that no the wrath of God the
[43:37] wrath of God must be full and when will
[43:39] it be full when the the cup of iniquity
[43:42] has filled up and the cup of iniquity of
[43:45] God is filling up and filling up quickly
[43:49] you find them they have legalized many
[43:50] things they've legalized many things
[43:52] that used to be seen they've legalized
[43:54] and it's coming down here here of course
[43:56] it will come down here it will go all
[43:57] over the world it's not going to be a
[43:59] European problem or an American problem
[44:01] it's going to be a world problem until
[44:03] the cup of iniquity has filled up and
[44:06] then the wrath of God will come down and
[44:08] in Europe in Asia and in America there
[44:12] are believers I uh met a few of course I
[44:17] was there and um I remember when I was
[44:19] in Germany I I I
[44:21] noticed there are very few people that
[44:23] get saved very few people here if if we
[44:26] took it upon ourselves and said in one
[44:30] month we are going to have 500 people
[44:33] believe this message it is
[44:35] possible how many agree with me it is
[44:38] possible right cuz I mean how many
[44:40] people brother Dixon how many people can
[44:42] you get to believe the message in one
[44:44] month okay in one day if you if it's
[44:47] your job you say I'm going to do it I'm
[44:48] going to witness about Jesus Christ how
[44:50] many people can you get 10 10 in one day
[44:54] multiply that by 30 how many is that
[44:57] that 300 you are one man all right how
[45:02] about each of us if we are 50 how many
[45:05] will that be in one
[45:07] month in Europe even if you make it your
[45:10] job and you doing nothing you're just
[45:12] eating sleeping and
[45:15] preaching even one person is difficult a
[45:19] month their mind is no longer on God
[45:21] anymore who are the people
[45:23] believing the children of former
[45:27] Believers the children of former
[45:29] Believers you'll find that there was a
[45:32] family that loved God so much to train
[45:34] their children so much raiseed them in
[45:35] the fear of God and and that seed was
[45:38] passed on to the next Generation to
[45:41] another generation to another generation
[45:43] and until now even when they backslide
[45:45] those are the ones that will come back
[45:46] and get saved because they they the the
[45:50] other generation before them had the
[45:53] power to raise the Next Generation after
[45:55] after them do you want to raise a
[45:57] generation of people that fear God then
[45:59] it begins with you you are the
[46:02] power but the devil is so against that
[46:06] right now it is seed sowing
[46:08] time and the devil is going to stop at
[46:11] nothing that's why let me tell you
[46:13] that's why he's fighting you so much
[46:15] he's not fighting he's fighting the
[46:16] girls and the boy the girls and the
[46:18] mothers too but I'm telling that's why
[46:20] he's putting all his guns and all his
[46:22] strength on The Man Child on the males
[46:26] on the brothers on you why because he
[46:29] knows he can only be destroyed if you
[46:32] don't get
[46:34] destroyed but let me tell you praise the
[46:38] name of the Lord if you don't get
[46:40] destroyed you can destroy the Devil and
[46:42] the works and the devices of the devil
[46:44] but if he gets you then he has got he
[46:47] has already got your your generation
[46:48] after
[46:50] you it's a burden I I I promise you an
[46:53] hour and a half I trust that it will be
[46:54] sufficient listen
[46:57] there's a cobweb you know the devil is
[46:59] burying them in a cobweb of of Deceit
[47:01] spirits and demons of Deceit Idol
[47:06] idol you know short business not
[47:10] business but busyness people become so
[47:12] busy doing a lot of nothing imagine
[47:15] someone being so busy but accomplishing
[47:17] a lot of
[47:18] nothing people don't know anymore what
[47:21] to live for I've been speaking to people
[47:23] and they say Pastor what is it to live a
[47:25] life of purpose I mean you don't even
[47:28] know what to live to live a life of
[47:30] purpose and people would say Oh no
[47:32] you're taking life seriously oh friend
[47:35] if you don't take life seriously then
[47:37] the generation after you is
[47:40] doomed you have to take life
[47:43] seriously because it's not your life
[47:46] it's the life of the Next Generation
[47:48] after you you are sowing a seed the
[47:51] power dwells within you the power dwells
[47:54] within me the moment I understood that
[47:58] years ago and it's been made it's being
[48:01] made real to me as you know as better as
[48:04] the days go go by and I I noticed I had
[48:08] to live a life of purpose and I had to
[48:10] fight and fight continually you do not
[48:13] let the devil bring you down with
[48:15] whatever it is that brought down your
[48:17] father or brought down those before you
[48:19] you fight it until you defeat it because
[48:20] if you don't the next generation is
[48:22] going to get to be overcome
[48:26] now listen if the devil succeeds in that
[48:28] he kills your destiny he kills your
[48:31] purpose he kills your abilities in each
[48:34] of you in each of us we have abilities
[48:38] We There is a
[48:40] purpose language fails me to explain
[48:43] what is on my heart to you but listen
[48:46] there is a
[48:48] purpose that God had when he had you in
[48:52] his mind before the foundation of the
[48:54] world and that
[48:57] purpose is as different as your palm is
[49:00] as your thumb print is each of us has a
[49:03] different thumb print you notice your
[49:05] Thum print is not as even your brother
[49:08] it is different even your brother from
[49:11] your father it is different did you know
[49:14] that your Thum print is different that
[49:17] is
[49:18] why the same Abraham could have an Isaac
[49:22] and the same Abraham could have an ishma
[49:25] they have different Thum prints they
[49:27] from the same father different Thum
[49:28] prints and even from the same mother
[49:31] even from the same
[49:32] mother the one woman can give birth to
[49:37] both the seed of God and serpent seed
[49:39] did you know
[49:41] that it happened in history one woman
[49:44] gave birth to Jacob and one woman gave
[49:46] birth to to Esau same mother same father
[49:50] different th print different nature
[49:52] different character different life one
[49:55] was of God and one was of the serpent cu
[49:58] the Bible says that God loved Jacob and
[49:59] he hated Esau you see as much as the
[50:02] father loved Esau but God hated Esau so
[50:05] Esau was not of of God but the seed of
[50:08] of of Jacob was different now if Jacob
[50:11] said I'm going to live like my brother
[50:13] because this is my family I I'm born
[50:15] here and and and if my brother is this
[50:18] way and my father even loves him I'm
[50:19] going to be this way oh friend you've
[50:22] lost your way you have to find God
[50:26] yourself even if your family disagrees
[50:29] with you even if everybody in your clan
[50:31] disagrees with you you have a purpose
[50:33] that you must fight you must find and
[50:36] you must fight for
[50:37] it we know of Jacob when Jacob found
[50:40] that he found he met the angel of the
[50:42] Lord and he said I'm not leaving with
[50:45] I'm not leaving you until you bless me
[50:47] I'm not going to leave you until you
[50:48] bless me the angel said let me go he
[50:50] said no I will not let you go until you
[50:52] bless me here is a man who had found
[50:54] purpose
[50:56] he had found Revelation let me tell you
[50:59] friends when you find the Revelation
[51:02] when you when when you find the
[51:03] revelation of the word and it is
[51:05] revealed to you who you are in Christ it
[51:08] is revealed to you that you are a child
[51:10] of God you were in the mind of God
[51:11] before the foundation of the world
[51:13] Hallelujah you have found purpose that
[51:16] is purpose the moment you find that
[51:19] nobody may find it in your family but
[51:21] brother when you find it amen
[51:24] congratulation you found power pass
[51:26] that's the beginning to fight for it
[51:29] until you win it when Jacob found out he
[51:32] was not just a Jacob he realized he had
[51:35] to change his name had to change the way
[51:39] he was born was perverted and he had to
[51:42] be born again he realized he needed a
[51:46] new name he realized I mean it was open
[51:49] to him that he had to be changed he had
[51:51] to be blessed now we are talking about a
[51:55] man who who was already physically
[51:56] blessed okay he had too many goats and
[51:59] sheep and ox and he had a lot but he
[52:04] knew he attained all of it under the
[52:07] anointing of Jacob because Jacob was a
[52:10] thug he he was just a a Thief you know a
[52:14] santer so he he knew all that he knew he
[52:17] had too much but he had attained it all
[52:19] through the seit and and so he knew he
[52:23] had to have the true blessing of God
[52:26] he knew you to to attain a new and a
[52:28] true blessing of God and the bible say
[52:29] that the blessing of God maketh rich and
[52:31] he adds no sorrow upon it and you knew
[52:34] the blessing I want is not what the
[52:36] world gives like I have but I want the
[52:39] blessing that comes from God himself to
[52:42] me because that is the blessing he was
[52:45] going to pass on to another
[52:47] generation amen it's it's not the
[52:50] blessing of uh of Deceit and you know a
[52:53] blessing of uh mixing up things and it
[52:57] was going to be a blessing of God that
[52:59] comes from God and he said I'm not going
[53:01] to leave you until you bless
[53:03] me and when God blessed him of course it
[53:08] wasn't without hustle and fighting and
[53:12] that's why I always say we have to fight
[53:13] it out the Bible says we have to make
[53:15] our calling and election sure he also
[53:18] says that
[53:19] uh if we
[53:21] don't fight then we will not reign with
[53:25] you him you cannot be an overcomer
[53:27] without fighting if you're facing
[53:30] something you have to fight it and
[53:32] overcome it you know many of us are born
[53:35] with a lot of things that we we do we
[53:37] realized we did not know but we realized
[53:38] we did not need it's up to you to say
[53:41] well I Was Born This Way in all our
[53:43] family we are poor you remain poor
[53:45] forever no problem in all our family we
[53:47] are lustful men you will be lustful all
[53:50] your life and nothing will change that
[53:52] in all our family we marry at 40 you
[53:54] will marry at 40 after all all your
[53:55] family marries at 40 oh it's your
[53:57] physical family but you have no
[53:58] revelation of who you are say in all our
[54:01] family actually no man can keep a
[54:03] marriage we all
[54:05] divorce you will be
[54:07] divorced you know our after everybody
[54:10] divorces so why do I even care why do I
[54:12] even mind about marrying and that's why
[54:15] we have a generation that doesn't want
[54:16] to marry because of the things that
[54:18] happened in the past they keep saying
[54:20] this is this happened to my mother this
[54:22] happened to my father this happened to
[54:24] you know this happened and to my brother
[54:27] this happened so I'm not going to be a
[54:28] party of this and because of that I'm
[54:30] not going to get married or to is the
[54:32] devil that is showing you that but
[54:35] remember that is not your true lineage
[54:37] you have another lineage and that comes
[54:40] from the word it comes from your true
[54:42] identity when you realize when it is
[54:45] revealed to you who you are you realize
[54:47] I have another purpose the purpose I
[54:50] have is not to continue my father my
[54:52] biological father's lineage but I have a
[54:55] purpose of continuing my heavenly
[54:57] father's lineage and that purpose is
[55:00] true that purpose has no Cur that
[55:02] purpose has only
[55:05] Blessings Now that when you find that
[55:08] you have found purpose but when you lose
[55:11] that you've lost your
[55:14] way now there are three things that our
[55:17] Prophet told us that
[55:21] ministers should avoid and he in the
[55:24] message life story my life story he said
[55:26] here is three things that I've noticed
[55:28] in reading of other ministers if this
[55:32] ever gets a hold of a minister it got
[55:35] him and there is weak spot and there is
[55:38] a weak spot he says one money two women
[55:44] three
[55:45] popularity and he says that's right
[55:47] Dodge the very appearance of it now he
[55:53] says in other words in the only way way
[55:55] of overcoming this is
[55:58] dodging
[55:59] Shinning the very appearance of it now
[56:03] it may not be the thing but it appears
[56:04] like that avoid
[56:06] it and the first one he mentions is
[56:08] money then the second is women the third
[56:10] is popularity and we have many examples
[56:12] in the Bible of people that were
[56:14] defeated by that many people who had
[56:16] great purpose in their life but somehow
[56:19] that got a hold of them balam is one of
[56:22] the examples of people that were CAU and
[56:24] over taken by
[56:26] money now here is a man who was a gift
[56:29] of God uh who was gifted by God and uh
[56:31] he was a prophet but because somehow he
[56:34] he maybe from down in his lineage he had
[56:37] this desire they had this appetite for
[56:40] money you know you say like in our
[56:42] family we just love money we just want
[56:44] to be rich and uh you know I mean like
[56:46] the man wanted money wanted to be rich
[56:48] he knew it was wrong he went to go
[56:51] because Bal came to him he said I want
[56:53] you to go and cast me these people
[56:54] meaning curing Israel he knew it was
[56:56] wrong but he said okay let me go and ask
[56:58] God God should I if you ever pray such
[57:01] prayers you will grieve the heart of God
[57:05] if you know what God wants you to do do
[57:07] it without praying don't pray for the
[57:10] permissive will of God if you pray for
[57:12] the permissive will of God God will give
[57:14] it to you but it will ruin your life it
[57:17] will remove God's purpose in your life
[57:20] and we've seen it that's why we are the
[57:22] way we are that's why we are born the
[57:23] way we are born because we are all in
[57:25] the permissive will the perfect will in
[57:27] the perfect will we would never have to
[57:29] be sick we would never have to be weary
[57:31] we would never have to be poor we never
[57:33] have to be beggarly in the perfect will
[57:35] of God but you see we are this way
[57:37] because of the way we are born in the
[57:39] permissive will friends don't ask for
[57:41] the permissive ask for the perfect will
[57:43] of God in everything that you do and we
[57:45] find that this man went went ahead to
[57:47] say oh please go let me go cast them God
[57:50] said well well then if you want to cast
[57:52] them it's all right you can go and cast
[57:53] them initially God said don't so he came
[57:56] and he said I'm sorry I I will not cast
[57:58] them God has said I shouldn't cast them
[58:00] and so I will not cast them and Bal said
[58:03] H wait I'm going to give you a lot of
[58:04] money a lot of money and and and a lot
[58:06] of money we're talking about a lot of
[58:08] gold and silver and and change of
[58:10] garments and things he said
[58:12] ah I don't want to do it but the
[58:15] Temptation is so big how many have ever
[58:18] been tempted by money you don't want to
[58:19] do the thing but money you feel like you
[58:22] want to attain it let me tell you this
[58:24] is what one of the things that kills the
[58:28] generation
[58:30] money the Bible says that the love of
[58:33] money is the beginning of all evil and
[58:36] all men that have prospered in this life
[58:40] have not loved money but they have
[58:41] rather loved God more than money men of
[58:45] purpose I'm speaking of men of purpose
[58:47] praise God and so the man went back and
[58:49] prayed he said oh God let me go and do
[58:52] it and and and God said all right if you
[58:55] want to go and do it go and do it so God
[58:57] let him go to go and do it and uh and we
[58:59] know the story how it how it goes later
[59:03] on we find that uh he he goes on his is
[59:08] it a donkey on us but he goes on his
[59:11] donkey and and as they're going to go
[59:13] and cast
[59:16] Israel the angel of the Lord appears
[59:19] before the
[59:21] donkey and then the donkey runs away and
[59:24] this man who is blinded I want you to to
[59:27] see what money can do they say money
[59:30] talks right now money was talking it was
[59:33] no longer the man of God balam it was
[59:36] man
[59:37] talking man can talk until you become
[59:39] blind of the
[59:41] reality the reality of the purpose of
[59:43] God for your
[59:44] life and this man was so blinded by the
[59:48] reality of money that he did not see the
[59:51] angel he's a prophet an animal saw the
[59:54] angel but he did not see the angel
[59:56] because he was blinded by the love of
[59:59] money and so he he struck it and then
[1:00:02] it's listen listen this is the
[1:00:04] interesting part and then it spoke and
[1:00:06] he said why have you hit me my master
[1:00:08] have I ever done this have I ever
[1:00:10] disobey you have I he said but why
[1:00:12] didn't you hey he didn't even realize an
[1:00:15] animal spoke for the first time in
[1:00:17] history he was so blinded that he he did
[1:00:20] not understand an animal is not supposed
[1:00:21] to speak like
[1:00:23] that you will be so blind that you will
[1:00:26] not see what God is doing in your life
[1:00:28] because you're blinded with the love of
[1:00:31] money and and and balam I'm telling you
[1:00:35] balam went and he tried several times to
[1:00:37] curse he would open his mouth to I God
[1:00:40] would say no I
[1:00:42] bless he kept them blessing and blessing
[1:00:44] and blessing but I would say he lost his
[1:00:47] way because of the Love of Money friends
[1:00:49] do you think he was rewarded by God
[1:00:50] because of going against the will of God
[1:00:53] he he he was was all all along going
[1:00:55] against the purpose of God for his life
[1:00:57] he was gifted in a way that no man else
[1:01:00] was gifted at the time and season of his
[1:01:02] life but see he did not use his gift the
[1:01:05] way it was supposed to be used you have
[1:01:08] a gift within you you yourself you're a
[1:01:10] gift to the
[1:01:11] world the sooner you see it hallelujah
[1:01:15] oh my God reveal it to you you are a
[1:01:17] gift to the world you are born in such a
[1:01:19] way that no man was born like you no man
[1:01:22] has your thumb prit no man is like you
[1:01:24] quit being like somebody else or wanting
[1:01:26] to be like somebody else you are the
[1:01:28] only you that there is in the world and
[1:01:30] nobody else can take your place or no
[1:01:32] one can be like you and you cannot be
[1:01:34] like someone
[1:01:36] else and that's why even when you talk
[1:01:39] about Role Models wanting to be like
[1:01:41] that one wanting to be like this one
[1:01:42] wanting to be oh friend you must be like
[1:01:44] you because you are the only gift that
[1:01:46] God has placed here in the world that is
[1:01:48] like you there will be no other you if
[1:01:52] you die you you are dead and another one
[1:01:55] another one not like you but another one
[1:01:58] will
[1:01:59] come if you can't accomplish God's
[1:02:01] purpose for you somebody else not like
[1:02:04] you but somebody else that is not you
[1:02:06] will fulfill
[1:02:07] it praise God I don't know about you but
[1:02:11] as far as I'm concerned I want to
[1:02:12] accomplish God's purpose in my life here
[1:02:15] on
[1:02:16] Earth and then we find that there was
[1:02:18] another person called Samson and Samson
[1:02:21] was um was an anointed man another
[1:02:24] anointed man of God but you see for him
[1:02:26] it wasn't money for him it wasn't money
[1:02:29] M for him it was women now for him when
[1:02:32] it came to women H it touched his heart
[1:02:35] brother I wish you would stay close by
[1:02:38] Brother Patrick and and don't miss this
[1:02:41] because after all who knows this might
[1:02:43] be your weak point as well and then we
[1:02:45] find out that uh you see when it came to
[1:02:47] Samson Samson was trapped
[1:02:50] brother Samson was trapped Samson was a
[1:02:54] man that was born with strength
[1:02:56] naturally God spoke to his mother even
[1:02:58] before he was born did you know that God
[1:03:00] knew you before you were even born and
[1:03:03] the moment you were born the devil knew
[1:03:04] it was
[1:03:06] hell
[1:03:08] Hallelujah I had three daughters and it
[1:03:10] was all fine no issue but the day I was
[1:03:14] supposed to have a boy I saw the devil
[1:03:17] fighting like I've never seen before now
[1:03:19] while I was studying this I know why
[1:03:21] there is something about a a male child
[1:03:24] there is something about a son there is
[1:03:27] something about you brother because the
[1:03:30] devil hates you so much because he knows
[1:03:31] there are things that you can do to
[1:03:33] influence another generation that nobody
[1:03:36] else might be able to do no other
[1:03:38] creature can be able to do and see that
[1:03:42] Samson when my boy was born of course I
[1:03:44] told you the story how the devil came
[1:03:45] and he fought so much I mean I've never
[1:03:47] seen such manifestation of demons see
[1:03:50] saw them
[1:03:51] clearly in a vision at the same time
[1:03:54] very early in the morning when I woke up
[1:03:56] I out of the vision I uh smelt that uh
[1:03:59] sulfur-like kind of feeling demonic
[1:04:01] feeling and my wife I noticed she was
[1:04:04] also struggling in her sleep so when I
[1:04:05] woke her up and she told me the same
[1:04:08] same things I saw and
[1:04:09] heard demons are real just like God is
[1:04:12] real and the devil is against
[1:04:14] you in a way that you can never imagine
[1:04:17] because he knows if you grow to an to a
[1:04:20] moment of understanding why you are on
[1:04:23] earth he knows his plans for destroying
[1:04:25] many Souls has been destroyed and that's
[1:04:28] why the devil would try his best to keep
[1:04:30] you busy he will keep you busy with
[1:04:33] money or he will keep you busy with
[1:04:34] women or he will keep you busy wanting
[1:04:36] to be something you were never meant to
[1:04:39] be and you find that you find that when
[1:04:42] Samson was so infatuated in his mind
[1:04:44] because of a woman he told his parents
[1:04:47] he came to his place say father mother
[1:04:50] get me this woman I want
[1:04:52] her it wasn't about what his parents
[1:04:55] thought was good for him it wasn't about
[1:04:58] what the Bible or what rather God
[1:05:00] thought was good for him amen it wasn't
[1:05:02] about what even God thought about what
[1:05:05] was good for him it was about what he
[1:05:07] thought was good for him he knew and he
[1:05:11] felt like he wanted this Philistine
[1:05:13] woman to be his wife so he said I don't
[1:05:16] care about your religion I don't care
[1:05:17] about your beliefs that's all yours all
[1:05:20] I care about is get me this woman and
[1:05:23] this is how the devil has got and and
[1:05:25] trapped this generation you find that a
[1:05:27] good man a good goodly young man but you
[1:05:30] see he's they are trapped you know with
[1:05:32] women and L and you find them completely
[1:05:37] overtaken and brother bam says when to
[1:05:39] gets all of you it's got you and until
[1:05:43] you're born again and filled with the
[1:05:44] Holy Ghost you can't come out of it and
[1:05:46] and when it got Samson you see it really
[1:05:48] got him to to the moment to the extent
[1:05:51] that
[1:05:51] Samson reached a level of course even
[1:05:53] when when this woman betrayed him the
[1:05:55] first time the second time thir the man
[1:05:57] was blinded he did not say that this
[1:05:59] woman is not good for me he did not say
[1:06:01] that this is this is not a good thing
[1:06:03] for me to be in this kind of Hall Tre he
[1:06:06] didn't see it he was so blinded by by by
[1:06:09] the by the by the moment and by the
[1:06:11] desire he was having with this woman
[1:06:13] that he failed to see the purpose of God
[1:06:15] for his life oh may God open your eyes
[1:06:18] brother that you will not be
[1:06:20] blinded blinded so much that don't see
[1:06:22] the purpose of God for your life God had
[1:06:24] a purpose for Samson but the devil also
[1:06:27] had a purpose the devil wanted to Blind
[1:06:29] some Samson so that he would not see it
[1:06:32] is the woman only the woman that is
[1:06:34] standing between him and the
[1:06:36] purpose if only he had seen that and
[1:06:39] removed Delilah you don't know what he
[1:06:43] would have done with the Philistine
[1:06:46] Samson was a
[1:06:47] machine he was born to be a machine to
[1:06:50] destroy the enemies of Israel one man in
[1:06:53] the of God but because Samson was so
[1:06:58] blinded amen by the woman he failed to
[1:07:01] accomplish his purpose
[1:07:03] properly the woman took his life they
[1:07:06] took him imagine here is a man born
[1:07:08] under a sign a man born under prophecy a
[1:07:11] man God the angel of the Lord himself
[1:07:14] came down and and announced the
[1:07:18] birth of Samson but still Samson was
[1:07:22] blinded and because of this it reached a
[1:07:24] moment when
[1:07:27] he was Stripped Away of everything
[1:07:32] and it's a bad sight to look at the man
[1:07:35] was blind they removed his eyes they
[1:07:38] removed his eyes when the first thing
[1:07:40] the devil does when he traps you he
[1:07:41] removes your eyes they will tell you
[1:07:43] they will advise you they will cancel
[1:07:45] you but you will be like I don't see it
[1:07:47] that way I don't see that why because
[1:07:49] there is a demon on you there is a
[1:07:51] spirit on you that you need to break out
[1:07:53] of and let let me tell you what can help
[1:07:55] you to break out of that is the spirit
[1:07:57] of God and the word of
[1:07:59] God and that's why we preach this word
[1:08:02] amen with so with so much enthusiasm and
[1:08:05] strength and power why because this word
[1:08:07] has the power to break you out of that
[1:08:09] kind of spirit and and and and you find
[1:08:12] that when Samson was in that kind of
[1:08:14] blindness you know he didn't see
[1:08:16] anything he was now blind and the devil
[1:08:18] was only making him to make they called
[1:08:22] it spot for the Philistines imagine a
[1:08:26] man born to destroy the Philistines but
[1:08:28] now he's entertaining the Philistines
[1:08:29] did you know that any time you go and
[1:08:32] you're trapped by this Spirit of
[1:08:33] immorality you are actually entertaining
[1:08:35] the devil did you know that if you look
[1:08:38] at a woman to last after her you are
[1:08:39] entertaining the devil the moment you
[1:08:41] overtaken with a woman you entertaining
[1:08:43] the devil you see I'm not talking about
[1:08:45] the sstem I'm talking about the women in
[1:08:46] the world the spirit of lust and the
[1:08:48] spirit of adultery and fornication if
[1:08:50] you overtaken by that you are
[1:08:51] entertaining the devil the devil has not
[1:08:53] seen such a best sight as a Believer a
[1:08:56] sight of God born under a sign for a
[1:08:57] purpose entertaining him in
[1:09:00] immorality it's a very bad demon and
[1:09:03] spirit it will take away your spiritual
[1:09:06] sight that you will not be able to see
[1:09:07] the purpose of God for your life the
[1:09:09] only thing you can see is the darkness
[1:09:10] that the devil has laid before you you
[1:09:12] don't see you don't have any hope you
[1:09:13] have no faith you're just blinded to the
[1:09:15] reality and that's why I always tell the
[1:09:18] people that you see the spirit of
[1:09:20] fornication what it does is it brings a
[1:09:23] curse over you and that's why people who
[1:09:25] usually go into fornication you realize
[1:09:27] there there's a curse over you things
[1:09:28] that you can't even break out of things
[1:09:29] that happen in your life you knew things
[1:09:31] would go this way and then you find them
[1:09:33] going another way because there's a
[1:09:34] curse over your life there's a Darkness
[1:09:35] you can't remove and and you know it's
[1:09:38] it's confusion because the devil removes
[1:09:41] your eyes and he makes you to entertain
[1:09:42] him and then literally you find that
[1:09:45] this man became powerless a powerful man
[1:09:48] became a powerless man and when he stood
[1:09:50] before all these people right there the
[1:09:53] only thing that redeemed him or saved
[1:09:54] him was he returned back to God he
[1:09:57] remembered he said oh God give me this
[1:09:59] one more time this one more chance oh
[1:10:02] God let me die with my
[1:10:05] enemy I believe that if a child of God a
[1:10:08] true Son of God would come to that place
[1:10:10] whereby you realized you were wrong when
[1:10:12] God let me tell you when God real shows
[1:10:14] you his word the revelation of his word
[1:10:17] and you realize you are wrong and you
[1:10:20] see the light that's the best blessing
[1:10:22] you can ever receive and when you do
[1:10:25] brother die with your enemy you better
[1:10:27] die but with your enemy praise God
[1:10:30] hallelujah and the man never fulfilled
[1:10:33] all his purpose because of women
[1:10:36] Brothers this is something that the
[1:10:37] devil wants to destroy the this
[1:10:40] generation with so that he can destroy
[1:10:43] the power of the Next Generation and I
[1:10:45] find out another thing that brother bam
[1:10:47] talked about was popularity Saul sa by
[1:10:50] bam says that Saul was a prophet Saul
[1:10:53] was a Prince among them Saul was
[1:10:55] actually supposed to be a great man but
[1:10:59] he wanted to be great and he wanted to
[1:11:01] be Mighty to the extent that he wasted
[1:11:03] it all and God brought him down whatever
[1:11:07] wants to put itself up God will bring it
[1:11:09] down if you see someone fighting so hard
[1:11:12] to pass everybody and to be up by by
[1:11:15] hook crew by any means by every means I
[1:11:17] want to be on top brother you are on
[1:11:19] your way down God will make sure you are
[1:11:21] down if you want to be anything in life
[1:11:23] humble yourself it is in humility that
[1:11:25] you become strong it is in humility that
[1:11:27] God lifts you up it is in humility that
[1:11:30] God makes you something it is in
[1:11:31] humility that you realize your life's
[1:11:34] purpose but the moment you think that
[1:11:36] you want to be something and you you
[1:11:37] know you feel like that's how the devil
[1:11:39] was brought down by pride and wanting to
[1:11:42] be popular among the men and everybody
[1:11:45] and those three things Brethren and I I
[1:11:47] took the time for that because it's very
[1:11:49] important in the beginning the devil
[1:11:51] desired to impersonate now this is this
[1:11:55] is another G I want you to listen to
[1:11:57] this the devil desired to
[1:11:59] impersonate you did you know that the
[1:12:03] devil desire to impersonate the man
[1:12:06] thereby bypassing him and destroying his
[1:12:11] entire generation now God had intended
[1:12:13] for this man to multiply together with
[1:12:16] his wife a race a generation that will
[1:12:20] fear God and serve God but when the
[1:12:21] devil came he bypass this man and he
[1:12:25] came to bring his own seed he intended
[1:12:27] to be like this
[1:12:29] man and by doing that he destroyed his
[1:12:34] entire
[1:12:35] generation there is something that
[1:12:36] touched me here I want you to follow
[1:12:38] this quote here in the Ephesian Church
[1:12:39] Ed says this portion of scripture is the
[1:12:42] revelation of how the literal the
[1:12:43] literal seed of the serpent was swn in
[1:12:47] the Earth the literal seed not the
[1:12:49] spiritual but the literal the the
[1:12:50] literal seed of the serpent was swn in
[1:12:53] the Earth
[1:12:55] even as we have we have the account of
[1:12:57] Luke in Luke 1: 26-35 talking about Mary
[1:13:01] and um and and the angel Gabriel and how
[1:13:03] God brought down his seed even as we
[1:13:05] have that account wherein he set forth
[1:13:07] the exact account of how the seed of the
[1:13:09] woman came into the physical into
[1:13:12] physical manifestation apart from the
[1:13:14] instrumentality of the human male as the
[1:13:17] seed of the woman was literally God the
[1:13:20] seed of the woman was literally God
[1:13:21] reproducing himself in human flesh can
[1:13:24] you imagine that God himself oh my God
[1:13:28] reproducing himself in human flesh so
[1:13:31] the seed of the serpent is the literal
[1:13:33] way that Satan found he was able to open
[1:13:37] the door himself into the human race the
[1:13:42] Devil Himself he opened the door into
[1:13:44] the human race he himself wanted to
[1:13:46] enter into the human race and how did he
[1:13:49] do
[1:13:49] that by using the seed of the serpent
[1:13:53] listen it was impossible for Satan for
[1:13:55] he is only a created spiritual being so
[1:13:57] it was impossible for him to reproduce
[1:13:59] himself in the manner which God
[1:14:01] reproduced himself how did God reproduce
[1:14:04] himself anybody
[1:14:07] knows by the spoken word and Mary said
[1:14:10] be unto me according to your word and
[1:14:12] she became pregnant so the devil
[1:14:14] couldn't do that and because the devil
[1:14:16] couldn't use his word to
[1:14:18] create so what did he do so because he
[1:14:22] couldn't do that so the Genesis account
[1:14:25] in the Book of Genesis tells us how he
[1:14:27] produced his seed and introduced or
[1:14:31] injected himself into the human race
[1:14:35] also recall that Satan is called the
[1:14:37] serpent it is his seed or injection into
[1:14:40] the human race we are speaking of before
[1:14:44] Adam ever heard car knowledge of Eve now
[1:14:47] when I read this the first time I missed
[1:14:50] it when I read it the second time I
[1:14:53] missed it when I went back to this court
[1:14:55] and read it the third time I cot it
[1:14:57] because I wondered why the Holy Spirit
[1:14:58] was leading me to this court for this
[1:15:00] service I want you to get it listen
[1:15:04] before Adam ever had Canal
[1:15:06] knowledge of Eve the serpent had that
[1:15:11] knowledge ahead of him that's the
[1:15:15] portion I had missed
[1:15:17] twice and I hope we'll come back to e
[1:15:19] and you get it and that one born
[1:15:24] of it was
[1:15:27] can now do you remember when brother
[1:15:30] when Pastor Sunday came to this church
[1:15:32] and he spoke about illegitimate children
[1:15:35] someone born by illegitimate birth and
[1:15:38] he said that they never get saved and he
[1:15:40] said that uh it takes Grace God's grace
[1:15:43] which indeed by God's grace anybody can
[1:15:45] be saved but then I come to think of it
[1:15:48] I said this also applies today right now
[1:15:52] you find that
[1:15:55] you know the devil what did he do when
[1:15:57] when Eve was a
[1:15:59] virgin please don't miss this when Eve
[1:16:02] was a virgin she had not yet seen her
[1:16:05] husband for the first
[1:16:07] time that Serpent of course the devil
[1:16:11] Satan had incarnated in that serpent so
[1:16:13] that because of the instrumentality of
[1:16:15] that serpent so the serpent came to
[1:16:19] Eve and the serpent had Canon knowledge
[1:16:22] of Eve
[1:16:24] and that was the original sin before
[1:16:27] Adam her husband would do it with
[1:16:32] her and that was the problem that has
[1:16:34] caused all the human race problems and I
[1:16:38] want to tell you the same thing
[1:16:43] today the same thing today the devil is
[1:16:47] doing we know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:49] same yesterday today and forever right
[1:16:52] he he is the same forever but Satan is a
[1:16:56] spirit too if Satan was Satan yesterday
[1:17:00] he is Satan
[1:17:01] today until you be destroyed if Satan
[1:17:05] did something yesterday he will do the
[1:17:06] same thing today you only change tactics
[1:17:09] if in the beginning he used he used a
[1:17:12] beast and the prophet says a man without
[1:17:15] the Holy Ghost is like a
[1:17:18] beast the devil is using men today
[1:17:21] working on two feet and deceiving
[1:17:24] them to go on virgin girls girls that
[1:17:27] have never known men before and you find
[1:17:31] these men defiling those girls remember
[1:17:34] if it's not your wife it is someone
[1:17:36] else's
[1:17:37] wife and the moment you begin to get a
[1:17:40] hold of them brother bam tells us in the
[1:17:42] message about the um brother bam speaks
[1:17:45] of the the the the the uh the virtues of
[1:17:48] a woman that God has given to her he
[1:17:50] says virtues of sacred motherhood sacred
[1:17:53] Womanhood and and sacred virtue those
[1:17:55] virtues should never be mured those
[1:17:58] should never be defiled by a man before
[1:18:01] you find or a woman finds her
[1:18:05] husband God has placed those things on a
[1:18:07] woman what is it her body her body is
[1:18:09] sacred the woman's body is sacred her
[1:18:12] breasts are sacred her body her thighs
[1:18:14] are sacred her body her body all over
[1:18:16] her body is sacred it should never be
[1:18:19] defiled by a man that's what the devil
[1:18:22] did in the of aen he went and defiled
[1:18:25] Eve's body before Adam could do it the
[1:18:29] devil did it because he was Satan from
[1:18:31] the beginning and you find that he said
[1:18:33] also she has virtue for her to be virtue
[1:18:36] as a Virgin It should never be defiled
[1:18:39] imagine God sealed her sealed her for
[1:18:42] who for her
[1:18:44] husband and you find today Hollywood has
[1:18:48] turned it into a hogwash our society has
[1:18:51] turned a woman into
[1:18:53] brother bam used that word doesn't sound
[1:18:55] popular but it's the truth Hollywood and
[1:18:58] the devil has turned the woman into a
[1:19:00] sex garbage
[1:19:02] car you find a woman going from this man
[1:19:05] to another man to another man to another
[1:19:07] man to another man and these men are all
[1:19:09] possessed by
[1:19:12] demons just like the women are and and
[1:19:15] you find that you their conscious is
[1:19:18] seared the B say their conscious is
[1:19:20] seared with a hot iron that they will
[1:19:23] not see the reality of what they
[1:19:26] actually
[1:19:27] doing and I've said many times to the
[1:19:29] young people that you see sex is more
[1:19:31] more a spiritual thing than a physical
[1:19:34] thing actually more spiritual Than
[1:19:36] Physical see what happened because of
[1:19:38] what was done the Garden of Eden until
[1:19:39] today we are suffering the consequences
[1:19:41] of that now when a woman does that she
[1:19:44] suffers those consequences all her life
[1:19:47] and that seed which she be gets out of
[1:19:49] that it takes God's grace for them to be
[1:19:51] saved we find that the the seed that she
[1:19:53] conceived out of that was
[1:19:56] Cain Cain who actually never received
[1:19:59] salvation because Cain was saent
[1:20:03] seed Cain was of of born of begotten of
[1:20:07] the wicked one first John 3:12 it says
[1:20:09] the holy spirit in John could not in one
[1:20:12] place call Adam the wicked one for that
[1:20:15] is what we would be if we were fathered
[1:20:17] if he fathered Cain we would also be the
[1:20:19] wicked one if Adam was the father of
[1:20:21] Cain and in another place canot call
[1:20:24] Adam one place Wicked one and another
[1:20:27] call him a Son of God for which he was
[1:20:29] by creation for he was a Son of God by
[1:20:32] creation hallelujah hallelujah and we
[1:20:36] Brothers I want to tell you you are a
[1:20:38] son of God by creation that's why you
[1:20:41] should never be found to do the works of
[1:20:44] the flesh because the flesh is not a son
[1:20:46] of God but the Son of God is in your
[1:20:50] soul and if you have been once found in
[1:20:53] that kind of Life the Bible Apostle Paul
[1:20:55] says it should not even be now among the
[1:20:57] Believers having professed Christ and
[1:20:59] salvation it should not even be once
[1:21:01] named among you why because now you no
[1:21:04] longer live according to the flesh but
[1:21:06] now you live according to the spirit he
[1:21:09] says you see the things that are of old
[1:21:11] are all done what passed away and now
[1:21:13] behold all things are new why because
[1:21:17] you see it's no longer you that was
[1:21:19] there it's now another man in here
[1:21:21] leaving another purpose
[1:21:24] he says Cain turned out in character
[1:21:27] like his father a bringer of death a
[1:21:29] murderer you see oh praise God this is
[1:21:32] so real friends that's why we see a
[1:21:35] generation that doesn't fear to murder
[1:21:37] you see those kind of people that would
[1:21:38] sleep with people before they marry them
[1:21:40] so oh you're prant oh
[1:21:43] just what kind of spirit is that one
[1:21:46] telling the women to abort tell me what
[1:21:48] kind of spirit is a spirit of Cain the
[1:21:51] spirit of the serpent he said he was a
[1:21:53] murderer from the beginning he is a
[1:21:56] bringer of death not life but God is a
[1:21:59] bringer of life not
[1:22:02] death and that's why they would sleep
[1:22:04] with those women but they are not ready
[1:22:06] to bring life they are ready to bring
[1:22:09] death because they have a wrong Spirit
[1:22:11] on them you see he it was a matter from
[1:22:15] the beginning he's at a Defiance of God
[1:22:17] when first by the almighty in Genesis
[1:22:19] 4:5 9913 to4 show him to be absolutely
[1:22:25] unhuman like in
[1:22:28] characteristics seeming even to surpass
[1:22:31] any account we have in scripture
[1:22:32] concerning a confrontation of Satan by
[1:22:35] God you find that that even the
[1:22:37] governments of this world are now ruled
[1:22:39] by Satan himself the governments of this
[1:22:41] world are ruled by Satan that's why they
[1:22:43] will promote abortion they will promote
[1:22:46] everything that is a anti- good anti-
[1:22:48] word and therefore Antichrist because
[1:22:50] anything that is anti- word is is
[1:22:53] Antichrist can you imagine that they are
[1:22:55] promoting drugs they're promoting
[1:22:57] abortion they promoting you
[1:23:00] know homosexuality they're promoting you
[1:23:03] know all this kind of immorality why
[1:23:05] because the devil's purpose is to
[1:23:07] destroy The Man Child again he doesn't
[1:23:10] want a generation that will serve God
[1:23:13] can't you see
[1:23:14] friends the devil is out against
[1:23:18] us have you heard them have you heard
[1:23:21] some of their ch
[1:23:23] I heard it and I couldn't believe my my
[1:23:26] ears they
[1:23:27] said I don't even remember the words but
[1:23:30] uh they said we are something we are
[1:23:32] something we are after your children we
[1:23:33] are coming those kind of words the devil
[1:23:36] knows but the people are blinded they
[1:23:38] can't see these people are perverted
[1:23:41] it's not them it's the demon the spirit
[1:23:44] on them on the generation trying to come
[1:23:46] at what the sons the sons he wants to
[1:23:50] destroy them imagine a full man of full
[1:23:52] grown man the devil telling them you are
[1:23:54] a woman because he doesn't want this man
[1:23:56] to pass a seed onto another generation
[1:23:59] that will serve and fear God no none of
[1:24:03] them can serve God why because they know
[1:24:05] recently the pop said that I just read I
[1:24:07] don't know whether it is true is it true
[1:24:09] he said that now in the Catholic Church
[1:24:11] they can marry man and man woman and
[1:24:15] woman imagine something like that you
[1:24:18] think it's coming from God the pope just
[1:24:20] revealed who he is before everybody he's
[1:24:22] a man who claims to stand on Earth on
[1:24:24] behalf of God on behalf of God on behalf
[1:24:29] imagine that he says he actually
[1:24:32] represents St Peter and therefore
[1:24:34] whatever he's doing on Earth is on
[1:24:35] behalf of God tell me is God anti
[1:24:38] life for for for him to desire that men
[1:24:42] will be married with men and women will
[1:24:43] be married with women he's trying to say
[1:24:45] that there will be no life it is putting
[1:24:48] an end to life but God is pro life but
[1:24:52] this spirit is seeking how to come and
[1:24:55] destroy everything just like we find
[1:24:57] here in the beginning they wanted to
[1:24:59] destroy all the male child he said if
[1:25:01] he's born a male kill him but he's B if
[1:25:04] he's born a women no problem let him
[1:25:05] live the devil wants to make all
[1:25:08] women everybody women he wants to
[1:25:11] destroy the seed the seed that will
[1:25:13] serve God the seed which will seek after
[1:25:16] God the seed which will move amen and is
[1:25:19] being inspired by the word of God but
[1:25:21] the devil wants us to be inspired by the
[1:25:23] World by Hollywood by by politics by all
[1:25:26] the things going on into the world but
[1:25:27] let me tell you there is a seed that is
[1:25:29] going to serve God I believe I'm one of
[1:25:34] them and even so it doesn't mean that
[1:25:36] these demons that are in the world are
[1:25:38] not going to come they will come they
[1:25:39] will attack they will they will come but
[1:25:42] listen we have to defend ourselves we
[1:25:44] have to fight until we
[1:25:48] die young men we ought to be shouting
[1:25:50] Amen to that we have to
[1:25:54] fight until we get every one of them
[1:25:57] destroyed and let me tell you why
[1:25:59] because we have an eternal seed we have
[1:26:01] an eternal seed word in us that seed
[1:26:04] which cannot be destroyed no matter what
[1:26:07] it can only be destroyed if we let the
[1:26:10] devil do
[1:26:11] it Satan tried to destroy the true seed
[1:26:14] by going ahead of the man no wonder to
[1:26:16] the world defilement is a normal thing
[1:26:20] to to them see says what what is it a
[1:26:25] it's nothing it's a it's just it's not
[1:26:28] nothing it's not nothing for you to
[1:26:30] defile a woman that is not your wife
[1:26:32] it's not nothing for you to touch a
[1:26:33] woman that is not your wife it's not
[1:26:36] nothing and that's why people are giving
[1:26:39] birth to things that we can't understand
[1:26:42] things that are not human beings anymore
[1:26:45] can't you see that there's something
[1:26:47] happening in the world the human beings
[1:26:50] are closely closely continually heading
[1:26:53] closer to the having the animalistic
[1:26:56] nature rather than having the nature of
[1:26:58] sons of
[1:27:00] God the serpent beguiled Eve and defiled
[1:27:04] her before her husband ever knew her by
[1:27:07] defiling the womb of the woman the devil
[1:27:09] thought he had finished the Next
[1:27:11] Generation no wonder in
[1:27:13] sin the scripture says in sin did my
[1:27:17] mother your mother conceive you conceive
[1:27:19] me in sin because we were born in sin we
[1:27:21] were we were born out of a defiled
[1:27:24] womb oh thank God for Grace if if he
[1:27:27] wasn't for Grace we would all be
[1:27:28] lost when a man is born again you know
[1:27:31] sexual sins should be far removed from
[1:27:34] him how can a born again man defile the
[1:27:36] womb and the body of another man is wife
[1:27:39] see as I was studying I just wrote those
[1:27:41] words by inspiration how can a born
[1:27:43] again man defile the woman rather the
[1:27:45] womb of body of another man's wife now
[1:27:49] of course then SS will say oh no don't
[1:27:52] to your womb won't be defiled you're
[1:27:53] going to have something called a condom
[1:27:55] and you use it and and you'll be fine
[1:27:58] and everything shall go well and you you
[1:27:59] won't make her pregnant but look you've
[1:28:01] defiled her body all the
[1:28:03] same and they find that Moses Pharaoh
[1:28:06] wanted to kill the Next Generation he
[1:28:08] wanted Moses you see because why did the
[1:28:10] devil want Moses he killed wanted to
[1:28:12] kill the Next Generation because Moses
[1:28:14] was the power Hallelujah he was the
[1:28:16] power of the Next Generation by killing
[1:28:19] the sons you see but God did not allow
[1:28:21] it devil wanted to Amen to destroy the
[1:28:24] Next Generation by doing what by killing
[1:28:25] the sons but what God did not allow it
[1:28:28] the devil wants to destroy the Next
[1:28:30] Generation by killing you but God cannot
[1:28:32] allow it Hallelujah because he know if
[1:28:36] he kills you the word will have lost a
[1:28:39] power listen I am the power of tomorrow
[1:28:42] I am the power of the Next Generation I
[1:28:44] am going to have a resolution to serve
[1:28:46] and live for
[1:28:49] God oh my May God not allow the devil to
[1:28:53] kill you brother may you stand out to
[1:28:55] serve the Lord Faithfully is my prayer
[1:28:58] and the scripture says and Pharaoh
[1:28:59] charged all these people saying every
[1:29:01] son that is born ye shall cast into the
[1:29:03] river and every daughter ye shall save a
[1:29:06] life because now he noticed they have
[1:29:08] been saved alive H oh they're not dead
[1:29:11] you couldn't you couldn't kill them oh
[1:29:14] all right so now throw them into the
[1:29:15] river drown
[1:29:17] them so now the devil wanted to drown
[1:29:19] Moses you see by the decree of the
[1:29:23] devil you were cast into the river the
[1:29:25] devil wanted to drown you by the decree
[1:29:28] of the devil the devil has tried to
[1:29:30] drown you in many things you know them
[1:29:32] all the things we've mentioned up here
[1:29:34] they Dev wanted to drown you in all
[1:29:35] those things because he decreed drown
[1:29:37] them in the river but I want to say also
[1:29:39] tonight by the decree of God God picked
[1:29:41] you up
[1:29:44] Hallelujah and if you are still not up
[1:29:46] yet I'm telling you God is giving a
[1:29:48] decree God is giving a decree tonight
[1:29:51] you must come come
[1:29:53] out and I want to say hallelujah in the
[1:29:56] name of Jesus Christ when you are out
[1:29:58] when you've come out then what do you do
[1:30:00] you go
[1:30:02] forward we have a job to do
[1:30:04] Brothers we have a generation to
[1:30:07] raise we have we are the
[1:30:09] power of this next
[1:30:12] Generation we are the power and the
[1:30:14] devil tried it one more time in the New
[1:30:16] Testament in the Book of Matthew when he
[1:30:19] realized that Jesus was born and he
[1:30:21] could not stop it he said kill all the
[1:30:24] boys H he was too late the sons you kill
[1:30:29] all the sons he tried to kill all the
[1:30:31] sons they tried to kill all of them yet
[1:30:33] God allowed it this time why because it
[1:30:36] was already too late the sun had already
[1:30:38] survived the son had already
[1:30:41] survived
[1:30:43] hallelujah praise God the sons now must
[1:30:47] survive
[1:30:49] too I think it is too late for the the
[1:30:51] devil to destroy this
[1:30:53] generation I don't know about you but I
[1:30:55] want to be I want to be one that would
[1:30:58] say I am not going to even allow my next
[1:31:01] Generation to be
[1:31:04] destroyed I was in Germany with brother
[1:31:06] Tim PR and he said something that
[1:31:09] touched me so much he said I made up my
[1:31:12] mind myself and my wife we made up our
[1:31:14] mind and I made up my mind that my
[1:31:17] children will serve the
[1:31:18] Lord and he said he told him he said
[1:31:23] son he actually told me he said he told
[1:31:25] his son which his son was with us also
[1:31:28] in Germany brother Timothy put is going
[1:31:29] to preach in the youth
[1:31:30] meetings a wonderful preacher he said he
[1:31:34] said to him oh to himself I don't know
[1:31:37] which is which but he said if you will
[1:31:40] have to go in the beer
[1:31:42] party I tell you boy he said I'll go
[1:31:45] with you I'll make sure I'll will go
[1:31:48] with you and I will step on that table
[1:31:52] and I'll preach a Pentecostal sermon and
[1:31:55] I tell you you will not enjoy it with
[1:31:57] your friends because I'll mess it up
[1:32:00] with the
[1:32:01] preaching I will go there with you and I
[1:32:04] said what a
[1:32:07] resolution and when I heard those words
[1:32:09] I I felt in my heart I said oh God help
[1:32:11] me to raise a generation that would fear
[1:32:13] you not only my biological one but but
[1:32:15] even the spiritual ones you've given me
[1:32:16] help me to raise a generation that will
[1:32:18] serve you and let amen the the
[1:32:21] generation after after them serve
[1:32:23] you to to others living Christianity is
[1:32:26] just like a dream or it's just like
[1:32:27] something like a religion like but to us
[1:32:29] it shouldn't be to us it should be real
[1:32:31] friends we should me it we should live
[1:32:34] it we should manifest it we can if we if
[1:32:38] we choose to we
[1:32:40] can and we are sons and we must survive
[1:32:43] and I finish with 1 John 3:2 it says
[1:32:45] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[1:32:47] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:32:49] but we know
[1:32:52] we know that when he shall appear we
[1:32:56] shall be like
[1:32:58] him
[1:32:59] hallelujah oh this is just touching me
[1:33:02] so deeply say for we shall see him as he
[1:33:05] is but here is the part that touches me
[1:33:07] now are we the sons of God not tomorrow
[1:33:11] now it's up to you to live as a Son of
[1:33:14] God now or to live like a son of the
[1:33:16] devil now but as far as I'm concerned I
[1:33:18] want to live as a Son of God now if
[1:33:22] Temptation if Temptation comes to
[1:33:24] overtake you brother listen to me God
[1:33:26] will give you strength to overcome
[1:33:28] it if you are purpose in your heart and
[1:33:31] in your mind and in your soul say I'm
[1:33:33] going to stand for the word of God yeah
[1:33:35] let it come but God will give you
[1:33:37] strength to live above it if he has done
[1:33:40] for others why not you why not you why
[1:33:43] not you you can decide to leave Lam if
[1:33:46] you want but as far as I'm concerned I
[1:33:48] want to live on fire for
[1:33:50] God I I want to to be decided I want to
[1:33:52] live a Resolute life that I'm going to
[1:33:55] serve God I'm going to live you know you
[1:33:57] can do that you can do that you can say
[1:33:59] I'm going to serve God my children are
[1:34:00] going to serve God the Next Generation
[1:34:02] after them is going to serve God and I'm
[1:34:04] going to say to it that that happens
[1:34:07] that's why Abraham told his servant Ela
[1:34:10] don't take for my son among these women
[1:34:13] here you see even it matters who you
[1:34:15] marry don't marry from among these s
[1:34:18] queens and among the you know whatever
[1:34:20] go down there in our place in our home
[1:34:23] God done there in the word amen and
[1:34:25] choose a wife for my son and out of
[1:34:29] there got a wife go how who led him God
[1:34:32] led him he wasn't even looking at how
[1:34:35] they were which figure they had which
[1:34:37] language they spoke how they were
[1:34:38] looking and their looks and their bums
[1:34:40] and everything he was looking at the
[1:34:42] word are they in the word are they part
[1:34:44] of the rest of Abraham or are they not
[1:34:47] that was the first prerequisite that you
[1:34:49] should look at but you see the devil
[1:34:51] want wants to kill this generation by
[1:34:52] letting them look at the wrong
[1:34:55] thing and he's taking the men and the
[1:34:58] young men be making themel filled up
[1:35:01] with the filth of the world he he does
[1:35:03] that with all these things if you go to
[1:35:06] Facebook I didn't have Facebook for a
[1:35:07] very long time I had it but I had
[1:35:10] disconnected it but when I looked again
[1:35:12] and cuz nowadays you have to put on VPN
[1:35:15] here in Uganda to access Facebook so
[1:35:17] when I looked again I went to my
[1:35:20] Facebook and I began crawling and
[1:35:21] everything that I don't know about you
[1:35:23] but what whatever I was seeing there was
[1:35:25] just filth filth and I don't know I did
[1:35:28] not know that Facebook used to have
[1:35:29] videos everything is just filed there
[1:35:31] when you go telegram same thing when you
[1:35:33] go to Whatsapp same thing everybody will
[1:35:35] post what they want to post and then you
[1:35:37] begin feasting on that you go on those
[1:35:39] data groups and You Begin copying all
[1:35:41] that those things and you feed on it you
[1:35:44] on a WhatsApp group that is feeding you
[1:35:46] with with filth and you remain there and
[1:35:48] you a Son of God there's a problem
[1:35:51] somewhere how could you remain in such a
[1:35:53] group exit the group and then you remain
[1:35:56] in such groups and then you arive the
[1:35:59] Believers groups because there is a
[1:36:00] wrong spirit and it wants to kill you
[1:36:02] but I'm telling you this is a voice of
[1:36:04] God to you tonight you see you can make
[1:36:06] a choice to exit some groups and stay in
[1:36:08] some and make others active because you
[1:36:10] are an active Son of God not tomorrow
[1:36:12] but now now are we the sons of God I
[1:36:14] don't want to be a Son of God later and
[1:36:16] a son of the devil now I want to be a
[1:36:18] Son of God now and I'll never be a son
[1:36:20] of the devil I have to leave for God now
[1:36:23] you see it's all filth you see all the
[1:36:25] smartphones and internet it's all filth
[1:36:27] you see comes to a place where by you
[1:36:30] know you remember when in the days of
[1:36:31] Noah when Noah told adav to go out and
[1:36:34] let it out adav couldn't find a place to
[1:36:37] put his feet it just flew right back in
[1:36:40] because everywhere was just so crazy
[1:36:42] filled with filth and uh dead bodies and
[1:36:45] stinking and it had to come back in but
[1:36:48] when he sent a crow out a crow can leave
[1:36:50] in the ark and a crow can live out in
[1:36:53] filth so you find many Christians have a
[1:36:55] spirit of a crow they can live in both
[1:36:58] you see you can go in fith and you live
[1:36:59] in there you survive and you come in the
[1:37:01] church and you survive but if I were you
[1:37:03] i' would be a dve and if you you're not
[1:37:05] a dve tonight God can make you a d by
[1:37:08] filling with the holy spirit let us
