amen you know in in Easter Su like this you find that you would love to talk about a lot of things the prophet preached the message called The Mighty conqueror and many other messages the Easter SE Calvary time we shared about that D Calvary blessed be the name of the Lord but today I have I have a thought that I want us to share and shall we take our Bibles and we read in the book of uh The Book of John amen John chapter 11 let's first read John chapter 8: 36 amen amen I welcome you once again thank you for coming thank you for coming and may God bless you Amen brother Alex you read first you're reading John 8: 36 you [Music] amen then you go and read uh you read for us John John chapter 11 you uh you read from vers 38 to 40 11 38 to 44 [Music] for [Music] want precious father in the name of Jesus we thank you this morning Lord for the reading of your word and we pray that Lord you come and take the full pre in this may you come and speak to our hearts Lord Jesus like Father we know that anyone can turn the pages of this Bible and can read but only you who gives the inspiration precious father May the Holy Spirit come and make this word alive may you prove to us this morning Jesus Christ you are the same yesterday today and forever may you anoint us this morning Lord help us know who we are this morning Father we thank you we bless your name in Jesus name we pray amen you may have your seat praise to God blessed be the name of the Lord amen yeah where we have read in John chapter 11 uh we are seeing something here about Lazarus Resurrection we are seeing Jesus rising Lazarus from the dead and we also believe that if the rupture delays and maybe uh maybe we grow old or maybe you are taken by another means May by the way of accident or maybe you drown in the sea we believe that in the day of Resurrection you shall rise and that's why we sing that song and say that in the resurrection morning we shall rise blessed be the name of the Lord and we are seeing Jesus proving to us that it is possible amen am because himself says I am the resurrection and life and remember he told them destroy this temple in three days I'll build it up and they thought that was talking about the Temple but he was talking about his body death and blessed be the name of the Lord amen John chapter 11 ver 38 says Jesus therefore again groining in himself cometh to the Grave J 11:36 yeah 11:36 where just where you from Reading I that it's John 11 amen that is 38 yes and Jesus said take ye away the stone mother the sister of him that was dead said unto him Lord but this time his stink blessed be the name of the Lord Lazarus was a family Jesus was a family friend of Lazarus and Jesus loved them so much and one day when Jesus was in the ministry he was preaching another side and Lazarus became sick and the sickness increased amen until Lazarus died blessed be the name of the Lord and when they told Jesus that Lazarus had died he did not come that very day blessed be the name of the Lord remember that Jesus of the Old Testament Jesus of the New Testament is the Jehovah of the Old Testament the creator of the heavens and earth the one who knew you before you were formed he knew you before your mother got married to your father that your father would propose to your mother and you would be born through them he knows the numbers of your hair blessed be the name of the Lord so Jesus knew whatever was happening around Lazarus amen and when they told him that Lazarus is dead it was not a news amen death is not news to Jesus the reason as to why you are dead in your sins why Believers some are still living in the their sins because Jesus has not come their way blessed be the name of the Lord amen but when Jesus meets death death becomes life amen amen Jesus never attended anything apart from Lazarus and guess what when he went there Jesus went there the man who was dead amen he came back to life what we need this morning to allow Jesus come your way blessed be the name of the Lord today the world is remembering resurrection of Jesus Remember death was challenge death amen in the human race right from the beginning way back from Eden if you read through the Bible you will see Giants of Faith he of faith amen many who stood with the word men who manifested God but when it comes to time of death that was their end blessed be the name of the Lord so death was a big challenger but today death is no longer it does not make sense anymore to a Believer because it was like this one Sunday morning when Jesus died on Friday he was hunged on the cross and after he was buried and they brought the Roman god to guard the tomb the Roman soldiers blessed be the name of the Lord but when it was working toward morning something happened amen Jesus came out of the grave but when we when we come back to Lazarus Lazarus died 11 CH now there now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the the town of Mary and her sister Martha it was that which Mary anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair uh when Jesus heard that he uh when Jesus heard he said this sickness is not unto death when Jesus was told three says therefore his sister sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick oh what a testimony Jesus loved Lazarus to the extent that even the sisters knew that Jesus can love a Believer until the whole world will know that man is loved of God Amen Jesus can love your family until all the neighbors can witness and say that family is loved by the Lord oh a testimony when Jesus heard that he said when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not un death when Jesus loves you and sickness comes your way and Trouble Comes Your Way thatness not death do you know why the love of God is great far that even when you go in the lowest of Hell the love of God God will bring you out Jesus knew even if the devil takes Lazarus death take Lazarus but my love for my friend when I reach there I will call him out amen he say it's not a t for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified there there there blessed be the name of the Lord the reason as why those things are there because God wanted to manifest want to manifest his glory in your life the reason why we are tried you go through fire a trial it is not to kill you brother sister but it's because God you want to manifest his glory in your life the Bible says many are the Affliction of the righteous but the Lord but alone not your husband not your father not your your uncle but the Lord delivers them out of it all amen amen our deliverance comes from the Lord our freedom comes from the Lord our joy comes from the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen then Jesus now Jesus loved Mara and sister and Lazarus and when he had heard this therefore he was sick he two days still in the same place where he was then after that say to his disciple let us go into Judea again brother I'm in a I'm in a dying situation remember Jesus has all amen and that's our human mentality that when I go to Mama here for a home I said Mom I need some help says oh son I'm bad love possible because by before you even went there she knew that she would help you so when the news came to Jesus amen this thought that maybe Jesus was going to go there immediately but the Bible say he AB there for two more days everything that we re see from the Lord you must be tried amen you must have patience and we learn patience by being patient it's just like how do you learn how to [Music] pray you learn how to pray through prayer how do you learn to be patient through being patient brother there is no school of patience on us amen Jesus tried their patience that is the God we have he is the solution for our problem he can bail us any time any moment but most time he leaves us to be he leaves us to be tried because he want to see how will you react for the Bible says he led them through the Wilderness because he he led them through the wilderness because he wanted to see what was in their heart most time we pray then we gro over something we intercede over certain things and it looks like God is quiet you come again the mountain is not moving and then you start murmuring then God says you see that's what I wanted to see amen but if you keep pressing on you keep pressing on most time when you're about to give up that is when when the victory is just at the door and that's when the devil will bring a lot of things around you a lot of thoughts around you sometime after fasting and praying for three days you have been praying fasting the moment you break you receive a call and you find very annoying call has it ever happened to you you having that Revival you seeing it's all over me it's keeping life then something comes and disorganize you and you forget that it's all over you immediately that is what the devil always want my brother my sister God want patience in US amen because if he says that he made them to go that way that is God's sa which God used to save his [Music] church amen you know when it tells us to separate from unbelief most time you find when we are still holding something with us when you believe and God gives you everything thing immediately you will go with your lipsticks and mean cuts and all those amen because people comes to church with different some with different Ambitions others come to look for sisters others come to call the church yes amen but through God receive God Tes each one of us you are not immune from trial you are going to be tried until Rapture our Prophet says we are not here for a picnic we have fighting the Lord's battle but I have a good news for you this morning that that great warrior the mighty conqueror is in our mid he is leading the battle blessed be the name of the Lord and you know what we are doing if it is a picture we are just dressing yes teachers knows that those who teach the the T they throw a complete picture then they tell you trust that is what we are doing what am I trying to say it is a finished work blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so Jesus delayed there for two more days and from there he told them let us go until Judea again and his disciples said unto him Master the Jews of the the Jews of let SW to Stone thee and goest thou thether again Jesus answered Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walth in the day he stumbled not because he seeth the light of the but if any man walth in the darkness am I reading uh these things said he after that says unto them our friend okay but if a man walth in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him these things said he and after that he says unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth this [Music] is amen they never brought news back to Jesus about Lazarus [Music] sickness how did he know that now [Music] sleepeth he was seeing Lazarus Lazarus was groaning in his sickness just like job of old he was suffering battling with wounds pain disappointment you amen when the sons of God sang For Joy in the morning praise be to God God asked job that question when he still had everything but after going through this pain after going through that trial some character was builded up in job amen so when job was there asking maybe had closed his eyes oh what a question then all of of a sudden it was revealed to him he looked at the tree in front of him that tree tree in front of him a tree in front of him and say that when the tree is cut after sometime it grows it grows again when man die dies forever Holy Ghost I believe spoke to job I believe the Holy Ghost spoke to job and told him no this is just the negative of the original and guess what happened I believe job was running around he was dancing around so oh now I know time after we have complained a lot and God does something you say oh God forgive me I didn't know that you are driving me this way blessed be the name of the Lord then the man said now I know my redemer live personal [Applause] testimony I know my redeemer [Music] live no matter what we are going through but by the end of it all Jesus is Turing at the end and the same Jesus is walking with us I want to tell you this morning children of God Amen that when that Jesus is in us because Jesus we are worshiping today is not the one which is still on the cross no sir that same Jesus he said that if I don't go the com will not come the very was with you if I go he will come when he the Holy Ghost is come he will remind you these things he will bring this words into your remance amen the Holy Ghost brings tribulation the holy gulation the Holy Ghost bring Revelation what we need this morning we need the Holy Ghost amen that Jesus is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ in [Music] US amen glory amen he friend s Jesus saidar sleeping he was seeing everything happening you m seeing you after you're done with your Ming then God say let us talk business yeah you mama oh God is like you don't care about some of us maybe he looks at you but the bible say that we are in the p of Amen something in the Palm is something so precious I don't think that you can put something like in your and then you no it must be something blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen you know do you know that you are Heaven being how many believes that I will re until you grasp it you are Heavenly being the prophet says the message uh God provided way you are Heaven being you are supposed to be hand of the heaven God blessed be the name of the Lord you are supposed to be a Son of God you are free brother you have got Liberty in Christ Jesus amen we have the Liberty in Christ Jesus Christ when he's alive in you and me he makes that body productive praise be to God may God give us revelation we ought to be the harest people on Earth we are the people who can praise God and the angels walk in our midst and men and women see them but sometime because some of us they not sure but we must be sure you will never find a pregnant mother doubting her PR asking is this it ising what or there's a child in am I suffering from blessed be the name of the Lord but when the mother conceives she's so sure she will know and from that time even her reaction will change her action will change she be so careful I have seen in a service like this one where the word comes and like the old church she running up and down and you find some mother running com and fall observe them they will never fall on their stomach amen amen why though she may enter Spirit the Holy Spirit so he's so organized and he's a gentleman amen but when you find sister saying I will not dance again I've seen them falling not seen someone raising that you say I was drunk in the spirit and I F and I he my head on the edge of the no sir when you are in the spirit you are out of this body it is your theop now overshadowing this one blessed be the name of the Lord that is why you need the Holy Ghost Jesus rose from the grave because he wanted you to have him in you Jesus cannot be in you and you sit like Dum in the church those dummies it can't be I don't say that fabricate it Brethren there is reality there is something about just confessing Christ Jesus there is something tangible that's why Jesus say God is Spirit God is Spirit and those who worship Him must Worship in spirit God is not worship no sir man will never worship God man will never please God and let me give you a bad news for you a kind of person God will never receive your son amen God is a king but because he knew that we're human being we would not know how to worship him we would not know how to make him happy what he did when he went on the cross he said that I will come and be in you when God is in you God knows what he wants when he dwells in you you will give him the right to worship amen amen then said disciple Lord but if if if he sleep shall do well how bad that Jesus spoke of the death but they thought that he had spoken of uh of taking of rest in sleep that is vers 13 then Jesus said to them Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your sake that I was not there 15 Read 15 Jesus was glad because he was not there why that this whom he whom he was with they should believe amen then Thomas okay uh okay then uh believe nevertheless let us go unto him then said Thomas which is called unto his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him then when Jesus came he found that he also got a revelation to go and die with him as well had laid in the grave for days already four days he was gone he was stinking he was tied up he was in the grave people were crying but Jesus saw this man when he was dying and he

I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Martha did not she never realized what was happening in her time but guess what she will see what's going to happen in the future and that is how the devil works that that's how the devil Works how the Devils the devil shows you what was behind and what is in front and does not make you to believe on what is happening now Jesus told Mara your brother is going to live againa is answering Jesus that I know but in the resurrection you see the devil was telling her the devil was trying to harden her heart that it is true but the resurrection and that is the same Whisper Of The Devil this morning you are saying in your heart this brother doesn't know what I'm going through you are right 100% but I also tell you God knows what you're going through it is not the brother speaking to you but it's God speaking to you because he said heavens and earth shall pass away but my word will never pass away amen amen then Jesus said I

because he already had the answer he knew everything because whatever the father shows me I can do nothing L my father shows me the father showed him each and everything but Jesus looked at their unbelief here Jesus wept then said the Jews behold he how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused the even the this man should not have died that is ver that is vers 37 listen to the it says Jesus therefore Gro himself comeing to the Grave it was a cave and stone l upon it then Jesus said take away the stone did Jesus removed the stone brother Brian did Jesus remove the stone but what did Jesus say take away the stone Jesus was not responsible of the stone the stone which was put there because he's the resurrection and life

have to do in our life Jesus died on the cross then he rose from the dead he carried our sin that's why we sing there is a nail to the cross oh how much he was willing to die Jesus went to the cross our sin with him there but it does not stop there you as an individual you have a role to play amen you have to pull that stone away for Jesus to work for you amen the B say that the bride has made

salvation amen new has everything what we need we need a new birth why ministers are toiling why converstions are being held is to point us to New Birth because Christ is taking those who are like him when we receive the holy spirit that is the portion of Christ in us but when he comes we shall meet him in the air you cannot even jump two feet from down but have you ever thought that how you going to meet him to meet him in the air do you know why some Believers in the church sometimes find them stuggling running up and down it is because inside their heart something happened and when the Great Mighty magnet comes close when he moves like this they move that side that's what we need that is what the church need that is what we ministers we need that's what you need praise be to God that's

so careful I saw something which I had never known that that I didn't know that when they are buing people there are also Norms or some things they do the rituals not even the rituals I found them struggling see that when when they buing a man when they laying him in the coffin is not supposed to to lie on the right hand I said wait a minute it was interesting say why because man uses this hand to hold a spear where is he going to hold the spear in the grave you see what religion do you are deceived when you alive and even when you die they deceive the body when even where you are going you are not sureen that when you die and you lie on the on the right hand side you not be able to fight with the left now what I don't know the left-handed people they make them lie with a right hand but
