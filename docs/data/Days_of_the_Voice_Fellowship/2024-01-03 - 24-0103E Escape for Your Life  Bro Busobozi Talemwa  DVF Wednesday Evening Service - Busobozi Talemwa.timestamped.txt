[38:53] have uh our first service to today in
[38:57] 2024 so it's a blessing to be in the
[38:59] house of the Lord and it's a blessing to
[39:01] see that God has kept us well uh the
[39:04] devil started with Brother Sam wanted to
[39:07] take his life but he failed and now last
[39:10] night the devil also tried to take the
[39:13] life of our sister uh Stella as they
[39:17] were riding on a motorbike and they had
[39:21] an accident and she was in the rush to
[39:23] the hospital last
[39:25] night Exodus chapter
[39:28] 14: 13 to 15 I hope that all of us are
[39:32] praying for the Youth meetings uh which
[39:35] are going to hold next week uh we
[39:38] have we have uh more than 200 people
[39:42] already registered and many are still
[39:44] registering and that excludes the team
[39:46] coming from Kenya uh and and so there's
[39:50] quite a lot so if you've not registered
[39:52] please I request that you register
[39:53] there's quite a lot ahead of us and we
[39:56] are trusting that God will come and
[39:57] visit the young people during that
[40:00] time Exodus chter 14 we are reading from
[40:03] vers
[40:07] 13 and Moses said unto the people fear
[40:11] ye not stand still and see the salvation
[40:15] of the Lord which he will show unto you
[40:18] today for the Egyptians whom ye have
[40:20] seen today ye shall see them again no
[40:23] more forever the Lord shall fight for
[40:25] you and ye shall hold your peace and um
[40:29] the Lord said to Moses wherefore CRI
[40:32] thou unto me speak unto the children of
[40:34] Israel that they go forward praise the
[40:37] name of the Lord amen you may be seated
[40:40] may the Lord add blessings upon the
[40:41] reading of the word so I trust that
[40:43] everybody will be fine with the English
[40:45] this evening is that amen so I'm
[40:47] speaking on Escape for your life and I
[40:51] know that uh I I shared on the same
[40:53] scripture at the beginning uh the end of
[40:55] last year and the beginning of this this
[40:56] year but today I want to dwell so much
[40:58] on verse 15 which says and the Lord said
[41:01] unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me
[41:04] speak unto the children of Israel that
[41:06] they go forward now you realize that uh
[41:09] when God had called the children of
[41:11] Israel coming from Egypt going to the
[41:14] promised land in uh in in in Canaan God
[41:18] desired that they would believe on whom
[41:21] he had sent of course God had sent Moses
[41:24] and Moses heard thus saith the Lord you
[41:26] realize that when God sends a person in
[41:28] your life what they have for you is not
[41:32] a maybe happen or maybe it will happen
[41:35] it is a must happen because they are
[41:37] sent from God to your life and that that
[41:41] uh applies not only to Moses and the
[41:44] Israelites but it applies also to us in
[41:46] our generation and uh the prophet that
[41:50] God has sent in our generation our
[41:52] brother William Branham his message is
[41:54] not a maybe happen or maybe will happen
[41:57] what he says or maybe it might happen or
[41:59] it may not happen uh you know the Bible
[42:02] speaks of a gift of Prophecy and how
[42:05] that when someone has a gift of Prophecy
[42:08] it it will all you don't just believe it
[42:11] you know when someone prophesies or
[42:13] gives a uh someone has a gift of
[42:15] Prophecy and and says something you
[42:17] don't just believe and swallow
[42:19] everything they are saying it has to be
[42:20] proved again by uh two people at least
[42:23] who are spiritual to say whether those
[42:25] things are true or not you know there's
[42:27] a difference between a prophet and a
[42:29] gift of Prophecy and now a prophet is
[42:31] born a prophet and uh when a prophet
[42:34] speaks what he says is thus sayth the
[42:36] Lord it cannot fail it will always come
[42:38] to pass but but someone with a gift of
[42:40] Prophecy he can it will sometimes even
[42:43] have a margin of error and even
[42:45] sometimes even if it it does not you
[42:47] cannot be 100% sure it is God until it
[42:50] has been judged you know that kind of
[42:52] prophecies is usually judged by
[42:55] spiritual people or men who are filled
[42:57] with the Holy Spirit to tell whether
[42:58] those things are of God or not but we
[43:00] see that in our time we have received a
[43:03] a prophet like God had sent Moses Moses
[43:06] was a prophet and Moses was born a
[43:08] prophet he was not a man with a gift of
[43:10] Prophecy he was a prophet sent a man
[43:13] sent from God and we see in our
[43:16] generation we have also a man sent from
[43:19] God William branam a man sent from God
[43:22] his message is thus saith the Lord
[43:26] his message cannot
[43:28] fail just like the message of Moses did
[43:31] not fail everything Moses said came to
[43:34] pass because Moses's message was not his
[43:36] idea his message was not learned from
[43:39] somewhere his message was 100% from God
[43:42] and there it was of God and it did not
[43:46] fail but you see one thing that I wanted
[43:48] to highlight here while we are beginning
[43:51] is that the message of Moses was Escape
[43:54] for your life he had brought a message
[43:56] to Israel and it had it had you know of
[44:00] course it was from God but the Jews or
[44:03] the Israelites had to believe everything
[44:05] Moses said if they did not believe what
[44:08] Moses said then it would it was not
[44:11] going to be applied upon their life they
[44:13] had to believe him as a prophet as a man
[44:15] sent from God they had to believe that
[44:17] what he had was not his idea or his
[44:19] opinion but what he had in his heart and
[44:22] what God had laid on his mouth was thus
[44:25] sayith the Lord can we say Amen to that
[44:28] so in the same way here we see that
[44:30] Moses now of course we already covered
[44:32] the other part where they were coming
[44:35] from uh from Egypt and how they had the
[44:39] pass overnight and how he he fulfilled
[44:41] everything God had told him to do and
[44:44] how they should eat the bread and um the
[44:47] meat and um how they should arrange
[44:48] everything and on that pass overnight
[44:50] the angel of death came and he passed
[44:52] over the houses of those that um had
[44:56] eaten and had applied the blood on their
[44:59] on their doors so we see that the angel
[45:01] of the Lord walked with Moses the whole
[45:03] time and now here they have come all the
[45:06] way from Egypt and Pharaoh had told them
[45:10] now you can go but you see when they
[45:12] arrived at the Red Sea before the
[45:15] crossing of the Red Sea that is where
[45:17] now Pharaoh now said to himself he came
[45:19] to himself what have I done how could I
[45:23] let them go and so he came with many
[45:26] Chariots of many of his Warriors to come
[45:30] and destroy uh and destroy the
[45:32] Israelites but here God speaks to Moses
[45:35] and he said uh and he tells him to speak
[45:39] and to go forward but before then Moses
[45:41] said unto the people fear ye not stand
[45:44] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[45:48] which will show to you today I want to
[45:50] say this whenever you know that where
[45:53] you are you are in the right place place
[45:57] where what you are hearing is the right
[45:59] message I want to tell you always fear
[46:02] not because God is with you and he will
[46:06] surely give you salvation no matter what
[46:09] you are going through in your life and
[46:11] here he says the Egyptians you see today
[46:13] you will see them again no more
[46:16] forever and he says the Lord shall fight
[46:19] for you and he shall hold your peace God
[46:22] always fights for his people are you not
[46:25] so glad that God always fights for you
[46:27] God always fights for you God always
[46:29] fights for me can you say it God always
[46:31] fights for me Hallelujah did you know
[46:34] that he even fights for you battles you
[46:36] did not know that you were fighting amen
[46:39] there are those that we know we are
[46:40] fighting but there are also those other
[46:42] battles we are fighting but we don't
[46:44] know that we are fighting but God always
[46:46] goes behind us he goes before us he goes
[46:49] around us to fight every battle for us
[46:52] hallelujah as long as we are right in
[46:55] the place where where he wants us to be
[46:57] but now I want you to see that the Lord
[46:59] said unto Moses at that same time he
[47:01] says where Christ thou why do you cry
[47:05] and brother banam uh spoke on that why
[47:08] cry
[47:09] speak and he says why cry unto me speak
[47:14] unto the children of Israel that they go
[47:16] forward that's what God requires for us
[47:18] to go forward to escape to go forward I
[47:22] I want you to follow this thought when
[47:24] they were coming from Egypt
[47:26] they were they thought they were slaves
[47:29] in their mind they had a mind set of a
[47:32] slave
[47:43] and they were only thinking that they
[47:45] were slaves did you know that you God
[47:47] can actually save you by his word but if
[47:49] you are mind has not agreed to what God
[47:52] has done for you you may not actually
[47:53] achieve your victory
[47:56] many times you preach the word but how
[47:58] many people would receive it and say
[48:00] that is nothing but the truth and
[48:02] absolutely the truth and I will do it
[48:05] very few many people will hear it they
[48:07] will say it is the truth but it is
[48:09] impossible to do it it is impossible to
[48:11] fulfill it but how many of you will
[48:13] always fulfill be ready and be willing
[48:15] to do what God the word of God said for
[48:17] them to do I want to be among those that
[48:21] will fulfill the portion of the word of
[48:23] God for my day and we see that uh when
[48:26] God sent them a prophet why did he send
[48:28] a prophet he sent them that Prophet for
[48:31] that Prophet his message to lead them
[48:33] from Egypt to the promised land and they
[48:36] had to go to the promised land and and
[48:39] here they have arrived at the Red Sea
[48:41] did you know that in everything God had
[48:43] told Moses he had not told him about the
[48:45] Red Sea he didn't know about the Red Sea
[48:48] it was a surprise when he found a red
[48:50] sea so he began crying why because he
[48:53] did not know that there was going to be
[48:55] a a Red Sea all that God told him is you
[48:57] are going to take them from go tell
[49:00] Pharaoh let my people go so he expected
[49:02] that the hardest part of this journey
[49:04] was going to tell Pharaoh let my people
[49:06] go but after that hard part was done
[49:09] then he arrived at a place where he
[49:11] never did you know it is actually God
[49:13] who led them to the Red Sea he told them
[49:16] pass here pass here pass here pass here
[49:18] by the pillar of fire and he led them
[49:21] right straight to the Red Sea why
[49:23] because when God sends his word his word
[49:27] will always work no matter the obstacles
[49:30] that ahead of you his word is fashion in
[49:33] such a way that it is so powerful the
[49:35] Bible says the word of God is powerful
[49:37] that it can even divide Soul and Spirit
[49:39] it can put it a it is so powerful and I
[49:42] want to tell you that there is nothing
[49:43] that the word of God cannot accomplish
[49:45] in our lives if only we can believe
[49:47] every word of God every word of God not
[49:49] some but every word of God and I want
[49:52] you to see here when he when he arrives
[49:54] at the Red Sea he begins crying oh God I
[49:57] never knew about this part but then
[49:59] simply God tells him why cry Moses speak
[50:03] to the children of Israel and go
[50:06] forward and uh in one way I would say
[50:09] that God was telling him just Escape for
[50:11] your life if you stay here they're going
[50:13] to come and Kill You Escape run go go
[50:17] forward and I believe this is what as we
[50:19] are beginning this year what God is
[50:21] telling us to go forward there are many
[50:24] obstacles that are going to hind us
[50:26] there are many things that are going to
[50:27] come before us brother there are many
[50:29] things that are going to discourage us
[50:30] brother there are many things sister
[50:32] that are going to come before you that
[50:33] will make you feel that you can't go
[50:34] forward but I believe God is telling us
[50:36] the same thing this evening amen that go
[50:39] forward go
[50:42] forward Lord this year is made up to
[50:45] destroy us Lord this year the age the
[50:47] generation the the time that we living
[50:50] in is made up in such a way that it
[50:52] wants it will it is made up to destroy
[50:53] us just like the army of Pharaoh was
[50:55] made up to destroy Israel but I want you
[50:58] to see in the Book of John Chap 10:1 and
[51:01] I'll just it just be a short sharing
[51:03] this evening because we are also
[51:04] recording for the zoom so it will not be
[51:06] more than 1 hour so listen to me
[51:07] carefully in John 10:10 it says the
[51:10] thief cometh not but to steal to kill
[51:14] and to destroy but Jesus says I am come
[51:17] that they might have life and that they
[51:19] might have it more abundantly you know
[51:22] when the Devil comes into our lives he
[51:25] he comes to to to to to steal the the
[51:29] word of God that he that God has planted
[51:32] in our hearts the devil desires to steal
[51:34] our Zeal the devil desires to steal our
[51:37] desire for the things of God the devil
[51:39] desires to kill amen that desire each of
[51:42] you each of us here have a desire to to
[51:44] serve God that's why we are here this
[51:46] evening did you know that we have a
[51:49] desire within us to serve God and that's
[51:51] why we are here or else we would not
[51:52] even have come here but I am here
[51:55] because because I love the Lord with all
[51:56] my heart and and the devil knows that
[51:58] God knows that but the devil knows that
[52:00] too and the devil's purpose is to come
[52:03] and steal not only to steal but to kill
[52:06] and to destroy that which God has placed
[52:09] within your heart but what does Jesus
[52:12] come to do through his word he comes
[52:15] that we might have life and have it more
[52:18] abundantly in other words Jesus doesn't
[52:20] want us to have just a little life he
[52:22] wants us to have Abundant Life he wants
[52:25] us to have more life Beautiful Life Big
[52:29] Life wonderful life not just a little
[52:31] life but a great life tell me where else
[52:35] can we get an abundant life out of the
[52:37] word you cannot get life abundant life
[52:41] outside of the word of God and I want to
[52:44] show you something here I quickly go to
[52:47] the B that I have for you this
[52:49] evening we are back again to the days of
[52:52] lot the generation that we are living in
[52:55] we are back again the to the days of
[52:57] Noah you know brother bam would say that
[52:59] history keeps repeating itself things
[53:01] that are happening now have happened
[53:03] before there is no new thing under the
[53:05] sun whatever is happening now has
[53:07] happened before and whatever shall
[53:09] happen has really happened before now we
[53:10] are saying we in the end time but there
[53:12] were other times that people or men of
[53:14] God preached and told the people we are
[53:16] in the end
[53:18] time I want you to turn your Bibles with
[53:20] me to the Book of Luke chapter
[53:22] 17 and look at verse 26
[53:32] it says as it was as it was in the days
[53:34] of Noah so shall it be also in the days
[53:36] of the son of man they did eat they
[53:39] drank they married wives they were given
[53:42] in marriage until the day that Noah
[53:44] entered into the ark and the flood came
[53:47] and destroyed them
[53:49] all I want you to think about let me
[53:51] bring this down from the scriptures down
[53:53] to our own individual your lives isn't
[53:56] this the same thing that is happening
[53:58] today you know the Bible says that uh
[54:01] they ate they drunk they married wives
[54:04] they were given in marriage until the
[54:07] day Noah entered into the ark now I want
[54:10] you to remember when God had given the
[54:13] message uh the message of Salvation to
[54:16] Noah to bring to the people of the of
[54:18] that time do you realize I want you to
[54:21] see a few things about the message of
[54:22] Noah do you realize that the message of
[54:24] Noah was for the whole
[54:26] world it was not a denominational
[54:29] message it was a message for the whole
[54:32] world they were all supposed to receive
[54:34] the message of Noah imagine even here in
[54:36] Uganda they were supposed to receive the
[54:38] message of Noah if there were people
[54:39] here all over the world they were
[54:42] supposed to hear the message of Noah the
[54:44] people that lived in that time that is a
[54:46] hard fact not very many people will
[54:48] believe it or will actually think about
[54:50] it that way but that was the truth it
[54:52] was a message for the whole world that's
[54:54] the fact number number one fact number
[54:56] two when the people heard that message
[54:58] they did not take it
[55:00] serious or maybe the message became so
[55:02] common to them that they they all of
[55:05] them knew that it was going to rain they
[55:07] had not that they knew but that they had
[55:10] it was going to rain so they knew by
[55:12] information that it was going to rain
[55:15] but they continued normally they were
[55:17] not deterred from whatever they were
[55:19] doing those who were drinking continued
[55:21] to drink those who were committing
[55:24] fornication continued normally no
[55:26] problem as if there's nothing going to
[55:29] happen those who were you know eating
[55:32] they contined to eat those who were
[55:34] marrying continued to marry as if there
[55:36] was nothing happening going to happen
[55:39] you know he's trying to show us that
[55:41] life continued as normal as if there was
[55:45] nothing going to
[55:47] happen I wonder whether we have also
[55:49] arrived at the same time friends where
[55:52] God has sent another message this time
[55:55] but also this message is a message to
[55:57] the entire world just like it was in the
[56:00] days of Noah and we have received that
[56:03] message that message has been recorded I
[56:05] I don't know how it was in the days of
[56:07] Noah but I am inclined to believe that
[56:10] message might have been recorded brother
[56:12] omnet because the prophet of God tells
[56:15] us you see that time they had
[56:17] civilization Before the Flood Before the
[56:19] Flood they had civilization which was
[56:22] actually greater than the one we have
[56:24] today did you know know
[56:25] that because they build they buildt
[56:28] things we cannot build today they built
[56:31] the Great Pyramid of Giza we know who
[56:34] built the Great Pyramid of Giza the the
[56:36] archaeologists and the scientists don't
[56:38] know but our Prophet has told us who
[56:41] built that pyramid and if you want to
[56:43] know him go and read the message but
[56:45] I'll just give you a tip Enoch and he
[56:48] said that Enoch was a prophet and Enoch
[56:50] is the one who built he was a prophet of
[56:52] God and he was the one who built that
[56:54] Great Pyramid of G is a structure which
[56:56] is in the true north perfectly in the
[56:58] middle of the Earth and when you look at
[57:00] it I mean I can explain a lot about that
[57:02] Pyramid of Giza but you will see that he
[57:04] called he called that the second Bible
[57:07] the second Bible the first Bible being
[57:09] the uh being the moon the stars and and
[57:13] all that and then the the second Bible
[57:15] being the pyramid and the third Bible
[57:17] being the one we have in our hands God
[57:19] has been dealing with the human race
[57:20] ever since but we see that during that
[57:23] time these people you know we perfect in
[57:26] Geometry they were perfect in everything
[57:28] they knew they were the civilization of
[57:30] that time was really much higher than
[57:33] the one we have today now we think we
[57:35] have cars now we think we have internet
[57:38] now we think we have you know good
[57:39] clothes now we think we have microphones
[57:42] and we can speak through microphones and
[57:43] people can hear us even in a you know in
[57:45] a very big distance but at that time
[57:47] they had it all maybe I I'm not wrong to
[57:50] say that maybe even in the days of Noah
[57:53] they had recorded the message and that
[57:55] message Noah had recorded it and it had
[57:57] been played on TV on television it had
[57:59] been played on radios and it had gone
[58:01] all over the world why do you think God
[58:03] took all those years to destroy or to
[58:05] bring down rain he was waiting for the
[58:07] message of Noah to go all over the
[58:10] world and the message of Noah went all
[58:13] over the world but people had the
[58:15] message of Noah but people did not take
[58:18] it
[58:19] serious that is the problem we have had
[58:22] in every generation that when God sends
[58:24] a message people don't take that message
[58:28] serious oh God help us that we don't
[58:31] also fall victims of that and the Bible
[58:33] says in the days of Noah what did they
[58:35] do they they married wives they ate they
[58:39] drank and they gave in marriage until
[58:42] the day Noah entered into the ark and
[58:45] the flood came and destroyed them
[58:49] all I want you to imagine I don't know
[58:52] how many people were on Earth at the
[58:54] time time but out of all the millions of
[58:57] the people that might have been on the
[58:59] earth at that time we know that only how
[59:01] many Souls we are saved eight Souls only
[59:05] eight Souls were saved out of the
[59:07] millions of souls do you think do you
[59:10] think that God will not do it again if
[59:12] he has to are you hearing me
[59:15] church is God able to do it again now I
[59:19] ask you a question will you be in the
[59:20] number of those that will be saved or
[59:22] you are going to remain down here in the
[59:24] tribulation
[59:25] as far as I'm concerned I do not know
[59:27] what 2024 holds but I want 2024 to
[59:30] prepare me for the coming of the Lord in
[59:32] my heart I'm longing for his return in
[59:34] my heart I'm longing for his return
[59:36] whatever I do whatever I say whatever I
[59:39] think I want to be right with him I want
[59:42] to be right I want my mind to be right
[59:43] with God I want my words to be right
[59:45] with God I want my actions to be right
[59:47] with God I want to be ready for his
[59:50] return and we see that the Bible says
[59:53] here that uh you know no they did
[59:55] everything they did until the day why
[59:58] listen please closely here until meaning
[1:00:01] they did everything they were doing but
[1:00:04] they stopped doing what they were doing
[1:00:06] when that day
[1:00:08] arrived which means when the day of
[1:00:10] entering the ark arrived and the rain
[1:00:12] began coming down that's when the people
[1:00:14] the people's eyes opened up and they
[1:00:17] said wait a moment something is
[1:00:19] happening we have to change we have to
[1:00:22] go in the ark and remember when the door
[1:00:24] was closed closed it was closed it could
[1:00:26] not be opened
[1:00:28] again all hope was lost all even you
[1:00:31] know Grace Grace was over the door was
[1:00:34] shut who shut that door God himself who
[1:00:38] gave the message shut the
[1:00:40] door and let me tell you history keeps
[1:00:43] repeating itself God is going to do the
[1:00:45] same thing in our
[1:00:47] generation but what was wrong at the
[1:00:49] time people never bothered we never
[1:00:53] bothered until the day Noah entered into
[1:00:57] the ark and the flood came and when that
[1:01:01] happened it destroyed them
[1:01:04] all listen sister put that in your mind
[1:01:08] put that in your head put that in your
[1:01:10] in your understanding and think about it
[1:01:12] for just a
[1:01:13] moment they had the message they had the
[1:01:16] message of escaping they were supposed
[1:01:18] to escape for their life they had it all
[1:01:21] but they left it all and they were
[1:01:23] destroyed all
[1:01:26] they were destroyed all what does the
[1:01:27] devil come to do the Devil comes to do
[1:01:29] what to steal to kill and to destroy and
[1:01:34] the devil is at it again we have now
[1:01:37] also received another message another
[1:01:38] end time message in our day and now the
[1:01:41] devil is trying to do what to destroy
[1:01:43] people people can you imagine that
[1:01:45] people will sit in the churches of of of
[1:01:48] Believers people will sit in the
[1:01:49] churches of message Believers all over
[1:01:51] the world but very few people will go in
[1:01:53] the rapture can you imagine that which
[1:01:56] means that people will actually be in
[1:01:58] the church but they will actually be you
[1:02:00] know destroyed by the enemy they will
[1:02:02] actually be killed they will actually be
[1:02:04] stol from what they have received why
[1:02:08] because they have not give come to a
[1:02:09] place of toal
[1:02:11] surrender I don't want to be guilty of
[1:02:14] that I want to if I'm going to serve God
[1:02:16] I want to serve God with all my heart I
[1:02:17] want to be genuine I want to be really
[1:02:20] genuine I want to be found ready not
[1:02:22] because of my works but because of my
[1:02:24] heart
[1:02:24] the status of your heart when the word
[1:02:28] of God comes to you do you tremble when
[1:02:30] the word of God comes to you do you
[1:02:31] really receive it do you accept it do
[1:02:33] you put it in your heart or you simply
[1:02:35] just blush it away and and say well it's
[1:02:37] all right we have had this over and over
[1:02:39] listen to me sister listen to me brother
[1:02:42] there is coming a day you'll hear it
[1:02:43] your last day and that day may be today
[1:02:47] time is coming when the time of hearing
[1:02:50] this message will be over and the door
[1:02:52] will be shut but when the door has not
[1:02:55] yet been shut this is the time for you
[1:02:58] my sister my brother to run for your
[1:03:01] life and God has laid a few things in my
[1:03:03] heart to say to you today I trust that
[1:03:06] you you shall receive it in the spirit
[1:03:07] with which I have received it and verses
[1:03:10] 28 it says likewise also as it was in
[1:03:13] the days of lot they did eat they drank
[1:03:17] they bought they sold they planted they
[1:03:21] builded but the same day h
[1:03:26] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[1:03:29] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:03:32] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:03:35] it be the days when the son of man is
[1:03:37] revealed I say we are living in that day
[1:03:41] of the son of man being revealed we are
[1:03:43] here once again and this he says how
[1:03:46] will it as it was in those days he first
[1:03:49] said as it was in the days of Noah as it
[1:03:51] was in the days of Noah what were people

[1:32:24] believe in Repentance we still believe
[1:32:26] in Holiness we still believe in
[1:32:28] righteousness we still believe in every
[1:32:30] part of the
[1:32:33] word we still believing in young men and
[1:32:35] young ladies being clean serving God
[1:32:38] seeking for the Holy Ghost praying if it
[1:32:41] means it all night praying seeking after
[1:32:43] the Holy Ghost because when that fire
[1:32:45] comes it will burn them up but thank God
[1:32:49] for the light that has shined in our day
[1:32:51] because it is calling us out of those
[1:32:54] things this is what this message is
[1:32:56] meant for let me tell you serving God is
[1:32:59] not easy serving God is a sacrifice many
[1:33:02] of us have sacrificed a lot of things
[1:33:04] and even the lives you wanted to live
[1:33:06] you have to sacrifice if you are making
[1:33:08] a choice to serve God you have to
[1:33:09] sacrifice you have to leave some things
[1:33:11] and leave it decide to leave it make up
[1:33:13] your mind to leave it nobody is going to
[1:33:14] do that choice for you you have to make
[1:33:16] the choice to serve God when you still
[1:33:18] can if you don't make that choice now
[1:33:21] now you will not make it when you are
[1:33:23] dead the moment you are dead you have no
[1:33:25] power to make that choice you have the
[1:33:27] power now when you are alive and when
[1:33:29] you have control over your thought over
[1:33:31] your heart over your mind over your
[1:33:32] mouth and then you can make that choice
[1:33:34] and make up your mind and it doesn't
[1:33:37] matter even you who were born by
[1:33:38] Believers and even to you my children
[1:33:40] especially you Elizabeth and shba where
[1:33:44] is she you think that your father is a
[1:33:47] person you are going to go to heaven you
[1:33:48] will not go to heaven because I'm your
[1:33:50] I'm your father you you have to go to
[1:33:52] Heaven by receiving Jesus Christ and by
[1:33:54] being filled with the Holy
[1:33:56] Ghost other than that you are going to
[1:33:58] hell and unless you repent every one of
[1:34:02] us has to repent every one of us has to
[1:34:04] come and find Jesus Christ by a
[1:34:09] conviction every one of us has to escape
[1:34:12] friends I remember when they were
[1:34:14] running amen going through the waters
[1:34:16] everyone the little ones the big ones
[1:34:20] the fathers the mothers all of them have
[1:34:23] to escape for their
[1:34:25] life you all have to escape for your
[1:34:27] life no one can save you but
[1:34:30] yourself the word has been given but you
[1:34:33] have to realize it you have to accept it
[1:34:35] you have to come to that place where you
[1:34:36] say I know God I love God I'm going to
[1:34:39] serve God with all my
[1:34:44] life the word has been given the only
[1:34:46] thing that is left now is the judgments
[1:34:48] of God but you see the Lord is waiting
[1:34:51] for for the cup of iniquity to be filled
[1:34:54] and for the last one to come in when the
[1:34:57] sins of the people increase God Is
[1:34:59] Watching God is seeing all the Sinners
[1:35:02] and if you here and you are one of them
[1:35:03] don't leave this church before you
[1:35:04] repenting because it may be your last
[1:35:06] time to ever be in church it may be your
[1:35:09] last time if you were Sinner and you are
[1:35:10] here it may be your last time don't
[1:35:11] leave before you repent don't leave
[1:35:13] before you put your life right who knows
[1:35:15] maybe the Rapture will happen the next
[1:35:16] minute or maybe you will die before you
[1:35:18] ever come back again make sure that your
[1:35:20] life is right with God and that you are
[1:35:22] walking right with God and that you know
[1:35:24] if he calls you now or if he comes now
[1:35:26] you are fit to go you are ready to go oh
[1:35:29] that's my
[1:35:32] desire and I I have only five minutes
[1:35:34] left so I just read a quote for you here
[1:35:37] H in the book of in the in the message
[1:35:39] the Easter seal and and as a song said
[1:35:42] we are seeking out that little lost
[1:35:45] sheep that that won't he won't come
[1:35:48] until that ship is in he won't come
[1:35:50] until that ship is in everyone has to be
[1:35:52] in in the fold he won't close the door
[1:35:54] until that last one is in so Minister

[1:36:08] comes in then the shepherd will close
[1:36:10] the door you see it it may be you you
[1:36:12] may be the last sheep here today until
[1:36:15] you come in then the door will not be
[1:36:16] closed that's why we now talk about the
[1:36:19] love of God he's waiting for you to come
[1:36:21] in but remember time is running and
[1:36:24] running fast time is running time is
[1:36:27] running

[1:36:34] because listen when I'm out there and
[1:36:36] talking to you I'm your friend I'm all

[1:36:39] fact that Hell Fire is there and that

[1:36:42] not made up their mind and have received
[1:36:44] the Holy Ghost make sure who you are and
[1:36:46] where you are and where you standing in
[1:36:48] the word of
[1:36:50] God Luke 17:32 he says remember Lord's
[1:36:55] wife whosoever shall seek to save his
[1:36:57] life shall lose it and whosoever shall
[1:36:58] lose his life and shall sa preserve it
[1:37:02] and I tell you in that night there shall

[1:37:54] right and he the angel told lot I will
[1:37:57] not destroy the city until you are what
[1:38:00] you are out of the city but that did not
[1:38:03] stop God from making Lord's wife a
[1:38:05] pillar of
[1:38:08] salt Lord's wife was the last one
[1:38:11] right maybe she was the last one that
[1:38:13] they were waiting for and when she came

[1:40:04] grabbed that little deer and the W would
[1:40:06] shake it now if the deer's real smart if
[1:40:09] you have ever watched it the deer could
[1:40:11] twist real quick and jump where sideways
[1:40:14] and if the wolf hasn't got too deep a
[1:40:17] hold it will Jack a big handful out or
[1:40:19] big mouthful rather out of the little
[1:40:22] deer's flank then when then what must
[1:40:27] the little deer
[1:40:28] do he's talking about the wolf having
[1:40:31] caught the deer and put his teeth in his
[1:40:33] body and the deer is trying to fight and
[1:40:35] fight and fight and when it fights out
[1:40:38] then the the wolf would just go off over
[1:40:41] the deer's flesh taking a little piece
[1:40:45] then what must the little dear do after
[1:40:46] that while the Wolves is are tumbling
[1:40:49] and rolling with the with with this
[1:40:51] mouthful of Flesh the blood begins to
[1:40:53] spot and when it does the deer got to

[2:12:10] father time is coming when all the tears
[2:12:13] and all the crying and all the
[2:12:14] repentance will do you
[2:12:17] nothing
[2:12:20] when you have an opportunity like this
[2:12:21] it's a golden
[2:12:23] [Music]
[2:12:25] opportunity and to you who don't mind
[2:12:28] about what I'm saying when the time
[2:12:30] reaches you you will hear these words
[2:12:32] again for
[2:12:34] sure a prophet would say when he was
[2:12:36] going down to Hell as the Lord allowed
[2:12:39] him to go there so he can see what is
[2:12:42] there he had
[2:12:44] voices of those people there
[2:12:50] crying out but their crying out was in
[2:12:54] vain and it says as they go down they
[2:12:57] they hear the voices those people hear
[2:12:59] the voices of all the preachers that
[2:13:01] have ever preached to them those voices
[2:13:03] come back echoing back in their ears but
[2:13:06] all for nothing just for
[2:13:11] judgment but to you today all the voices
[2:13:13] you've ever heard minister to you in
[2:13:15] your heart it's a voice of God to you to
[2:13:18] save you not to judge
[2:13:20] you and you only have that chance to
[2:13:22] receive the salvation and grace of God
[2:13:25] when you are here on Earth and say Lord
[2:13:27] I want to surrender myself to you
[2:13:29] wholeheartedly in this year Lord as we
[2:13:31] start this year I want to just begin on
[2:13:33] a clean

[2:14:10] nothing spending only 1 hour two 3 hours
[2:14:13] in his
[2:14:15] presence you will know it was worth it
[2:14:19] even wor worth more than anything else
