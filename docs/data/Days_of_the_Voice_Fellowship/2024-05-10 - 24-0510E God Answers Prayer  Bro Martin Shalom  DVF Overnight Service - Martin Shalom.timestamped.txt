[43:11] prayer amen amen because our Prophet
[43:14] tells us we can read the word we can
[43:17] sing so much we can jump too much we can
[43:21] shout but we'll never pray too much amen
[43:25] and remember uh uh Jesus Christ told us
[43:28] always to pray without ceasing
[43:31] amen he told us always to pray without
[43:36] ceasing that's why every Friday we come
[43:40] here every
[43:41] Wednesday every Sunday at our homes our
[43:46] workplace
[43:47] amen so because uh the strength of uh
[43:51] the believer is in prayer blessed be the
[43:54] name of the Lord and you will see where
[43:57] brother Wanga read for us in
[44:01] James uh the Bible tells us about some
[44:05] uh still about
[44:07] prayer and this
[44:10] evening I would call my text that God
[44:14] answers prayer amen
[44:18] amen the only language that God knows is
[44:21] prayer blessed be the name of the Lord
[44:24] and that's why in James uh uh he told us
[44:28] the same thing is there
[44:30] anyone amidst us who is
[44:34] Afflicted he does not tell us to go and
[44:36] do something different
[44:38] but is there someone who's lacking this
[44:41] amen amen he tells us to pray blessed be
[44:45] the name of the Lord that's where our
[44:47] strength is and even here in Isaiah he
[44:51] says in Isaiah
[44:53] 65: 24 that it shall come to pass pass
[44:59] amen 23 say that they shall not labor in
[45:03] vain nor bring forth for trouble for
[45:08] they are the seed of the Blessed of the
[45:11] Lord and their offspring with them it
[45:15] shall come to pass that before they call
[45:20] I will
[45:22] answer this
[45:24] calling it is in prayer
[45:28] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[45:30] while they yet they are yet
[45:33] speaking I will hear amen blessed be the
[45:38] name of the Lord am before even you
[45:40] start praying God knows your need amen
[45:46] but still regardless of him knowing our
[45:48] need he want us to tell him about it
[45:53] that's why the Bible tells us that we
[45:55] should make our request
[45:57] known before God in prayers and
[46:01] supplication amen blessed be the name of
[46:04] the Lord I remember one time we uh
[46:06] shared about almost this very thing and
[46:10] we said that if a child go to the father
[46:13] and you just look at your father in the
[46:14] face like you are quiet you just you
[46:16] just looking at him do you think he will
[46:19] respond he will ask whether you whether
[46:22] you okay blessed be the name of the Lord
[46:25] and also the way we approach
[46:28] I had some other like what I what I
[46:31] thought that I talked about this
[46:33] evening about something about to worship
[46:37] I was reading the Bible and I realized
[46:39] that when God spoke to
[46:42] Abraham in Genesis
[46:46] 22 and told him to go and offer his
[46:50] son do you know that the journey to
[46:53] mount Mariah it was 3 days joury
[46:58] blessed be the name of the Lord it never
[47:01] happened
[47:02] instantly but God told him God knew very
[47:05] well that this man was going to work for
[47:07] three
[47:08] days so God gave him time to think about
[47:12] it blessed be the name of the
[47:16] Lord because remember Abraham kept that
[47:19] secret even from from his
[47:22] wife Abraham never told sah that he was
[47:24] going to offer Isaac Blessed Be the name
[47:27] of the Lord but I believe this man had
[47:29] prayed amen because for the time he
[47:32] waited on God to receive that promised
[47:36] son he waited enough blessed be the name
[47:39] of the Lord and he was so sure that God
[47:43] was more than able to resurrect his son
[47:47] praise be to God and you see God gave
[47:51] him three days this man was going to
[47:53] offer his
[47:55] son the same God God who told him to
[47:57] leave his
[47:59] people 50 years
[48:02] ago that same God came back again to
[48:06] test his
[48:08] faith this time round is by him offering
[48:11] his son and still the man's Faith was
[48:15] solid what kept Abraham going it was
[48:18] because Abraham was in the presence of
[48:21] God Amen he kept himself always praying
[48:25] blessed be the name of the Lord and here
[48:28] uh there is a quote
[48:31] here uh in the message trying to do God
[48:34] a
[48:35] service trying to do God a service
[48:38] without being the will of God the
[48:40] prophet say that notice David he got the
[48:43] Revelation and
[48:45] noticed it was not the prophet nathanel
[48:50] that got the Revelation it was
[48:53] David the king that got the
[48:57] Revelation neither was nathanel
[49:00] consulted about it he never asked
[49:03] nathanel but did you see here in the
[49:08] first Chronicles he consulted the
[49:10] captain of the thousand and the captain
[49:13] of the hundreds and he never consulted
[49:16] nathanel he consulted the people in the
[49:19] days of Soul they left off Consulting
[49:24] God Amen remember sa
[49:27] bad he was a l
[49:31] king but the ark and the UR th they left
[49:35] off doing that David say now let us get
[49:39] back to God all of us and let us get
[49:42] back to the right thing let us go down
[49:45] and get the ark bring it here bring the
[49:48] presence of God in other words in the
[49:51] city let us hold a
[49:54] Revival let us bring
[49:57] people back but he got the Revelation
[50:00] which seems to be good but it wasn't the
[50:03] will of God instead of asking the source
[50:07] that he should have asked he consulted
[50:10] his captain because he had just become a
[50:14] king blessed be the name of the Lord
[50:18] when David got this Revelation he was
[50:20] supposed to go and consult
[50:23] God In Prayer or go consult the king
[50:26] King because the word of or the prophet
[50:29] rather because the word of God comes to
[50:31] the prophet blessed be the name of the
[50:34] Lord the reason asked why we quote the
[50:36] message it is because we believe that
[50:39] the messenger of this
[50:41] age amen amen he was a Vindicated
[50:44] prophet of
[50:46] God and we are reading from him because
[50:50] this the word from God blessed be the
[50:53] name of the Lord and here the prophet
[50:56] say that David made a mistake because
[50:58] instead of Consulting the prophet he
[51:01] went and
[51:03] consulted the people blessed be the name
[51:06] of the Lord amen
[51:08] amen and uh if we go back to
[51:13] James let us go back to James
[51:32] we read James chapter
[51:43] 5
[51:49] okay praise be to God Amen
[52:06] [Music]
[52:14] James chapter 5 he says that
[52:17] uh if you read nine from nine says that
[52:21] Grudge not one against another Brethren
[52:24] L you be condemned behold the judge
[52:28] standeth before the door take my
[52:32] brethren the prophet who have spoken in

[52:46] have heard of the patience of Job and
[52:49] have seen the end of the end of the Lord
[52:52] that the Lord is very pitiful and of
[52:56] tender mind meres but Above All Things

[53:34] them pray over him anointing him with
[53:39] oil in the name of the Lord blessed be
[53:43] the name of the Lord amen the only way
[53:46] to go as Christian is the prayer way do
[53:51] we have any answer we want from God the
[53:54] Bible tells us to pray do we have any
[53:57] need we have it tells us to pray and
[54:01] this evening I'm telling you that the
[54:03] answer is only in prayer oh God answers
[54:08] prayer amen is there anything we need
[54:12] tonight in our life in our homes in
[54:15] whatever we are doing it tells us to
[54:19] pray blessed be the name of the Lord he
[54:22] says confess your fault one to another
[54:25] and pray one for another that you may be
[54:28] healed still you pray you confess your
[54:32] faults one to
[54:36] another and then you pray one to
[54:40] another when a brother confesses is
[54:42] false to
[54:44] you it means or it tells you to pray
[54:48] with him
[54:50] amen but not to carry
[54:54] it and you move every house every door
[54:58] every window every tree everywhere
[55:01] blessed be the name of the Lord but it
[55:03] tells you the Bible tells us we confess
[55:06] our faults one to another that we may be
[55:10] healed
[55:11] amen and we pray one for
[55:15] another we are very sometime we find
[55:18] ourself wanting in this area we don't
[55:22] pray one for
[55:24] another blessed be the name of the the
[55:26] Lord amen and when we are praying one
[55:28] for another it doesn't mean I pray for
[55:31] brother long God may you help him in the
[55:33] name of Jesus Christ I pray for Brother
[55:35] Joseph

[55:47] for his ministry pray for his family
[55:49] pray for his business amen that's how we
[55:52] pray one for another and Bam tells say
[55:56] that when we are praying one for another
[55:58] we are taking a med seat amen you are
[56:03] taking the place of Jesus interceding
[56:06] for your brother amen when we when we
[56:09] are interceding one for another we are
[56:11] taking the place of Jesus Christ blessed
[56:15] be the name of the Lord amen amen and he
[56:18] say that effectual fervent
[56:22] prayer of a righteous man a veth much
[56:31] amen praise be to God
[56:37] am Elias was a man subject like passion
[56:42] as we
[56:43] are in fact we are just reminding
[56:46] ourself here it tells us of
[56:49] Elijah
[56:51] Elijah he was just like us full of
[56:55] weaknesses
[56:57] sometime when we hear or when we read of
[56:59] The Heroes of Faith we think they were
[57:02] great men and if you look at the the
[57:05] mental perception of the world today if
[57:09] you look at the picture of Samson they
[57:12] draw they take
[57:17] today man with bunch of
[57:20] muscles man with six
[57:24] packs amen but our Prophet tells us that
[57:28] Samson was just ordinary man like any
[57:31] man but what made difference was the
[57:36] spirit of God upon Samson amen look at
[57:40] Jesus Jesus was not giant like he was
[57:43] not a mascular man he was just simple
[57:47] man amen amen but when is Under The
[57:52] anointing that was different story
[57:55] blessed be the name of the Lord and the
[57:57] prophet tells us that anointing upon
[57:59] Samson is what did
[58:02] wonders
[58:04] amen when the anointing could come upon
[58:07] him that was all that Samson needed and
[58:11] what you need tonight what the church
[58:13] need today is the anointing of the Holy
[58:17] Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:20] and that anointing must come inside
[58:23] outwardly praise be to God
[58:26] amen elah was just an ordinary man like
[58:30] any of us but one day he met the king
[58:35] and spoke just like I'm speaking to you
[58:39] and told the king it will not reain for
[58:42] three and a half years blessed be the
[58:45] name of the Lord he had the key of Faith
[58:49] blessed be the name of the Lord because
[58:51] the Bible says whosoever comes to God
[58:53] Must Believe first of all you must
[58:56] believe that he is and he is the
[58:59] rewarder of those who seek at him
[59:02] diligently this man had Faith this man
[59:06] had God this man knew what he was
[59:10] talking about blessed be the name of the
[59:13] Lord and the King maybe thought that
[59:15] this man was joking when he told him
[59:18] that it will not rain for 3 and A2 years
[59:22] that says that not rain for three and A2
[59:23] years he got the key put in his pocket
[59:27] and left blessed be the name of the
[59:31] Lord and maybe that very
[59:40] day blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:43] because remember amen whosoever comes to
[59:47] God must be
[59:49] tested you must be tried amen your faith
[59:54] must be tried
[59:56] do you think his God did not try his
[59:59] faith God did try his
[1:00:03] faith praise be to God I believe that
[1:00:06] evening he was seated in his
[1:00:10] [Applause]
[1:00:14] room and this is a man who's just from
[1:00:16] stopping rain for three and a half years
[1:00:20] but in just 10 minutes down the
[1:00:24] road blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:00:28] this man knew what he was talking about
[1:00:32] he had met God praise be to God he had
[1:00:36] prayed amen and God had told him it will
[1:00:40] not rain praise be to
[1:00:45] God but the man had closed the rain he
[1:00:49] knew that the answer was any prayer he
[1:00:52] had prayed and God had answered his
[1:00:55] prayer praise be to
[1:01:08] God one day two day three 1 month 5
[1:01:14] month 6
[1:01:19] month do you know what it means it not
[1:01:22] rain for three and a half years
[1:01:33] am because when God
[1:01:36] speaks it is different from what man
[1:01:40] says amen I believe God
[1:01:44] commanded even the
[1:01:52] river praise be to God
[1:01:56] one
[1:01:58] year second
[1:02:05] year but the Bible tells us this man was
[1:02:08] full of weakness like us
[1:02:12] amen he was a man subjected to Passion
[1:02:16] as we are he prayed
[1:02:20] honestly that it might not rain and it
[1:02:24] rain not on Earth by the space of 3 3
[1:02:27] years and six
[1:02:29] months he prayed
[1:02:32] earnestly do you pray
[1:02:35] honestly do we pray honestly blessed be
[1:02:38] the name of the Lord and he prayed again
[1:02:40] and the heaven gave rain and the Earth
[1:02:43] brought forth of her fruit Brethren if
[1:02:46] any of you do error from the truth and
[1:02:49] one convert him let him know that he

[1:03:00] and shall hide
[1:03:03] multitude of sin blessed be the name of
[1:03:06] the Lord am amen and listen to what the
[1:03:09] prophet says in the
[1:03:12] message

[1:03:26] cold shoulder to anyone no matter what

[1:04:58] time do you love that person do you love
[1:05:01] that

[1:06:00] you you don't even know where you hurt
[1:06:03] the

[1:07:50] desperation with
[1:07:53] consistency when a writer man a good man
[1:07:58] gets in travail or Soul travail amen
[1:08:02] that's when something happens am the
[1:08:05] righteousness of God in
[1:08:08] us we must be
[1:08:12] desperate it is desperation that brings
[1:08:14] out the result it's that desperation
[1:08:17] that brings that
[1:08:19] consistency the reason asked why every
[1:08:22] time you want you come to church is
[1:08:25] because have something in your heart you
[1:08:27] are longing for something in in your
[1:08:29] soul and you are crying to get somewhere

[1:08:35] Lord amen and that is the soul
[1:08:39] travail in fact a Christian without Soul
[1:08:41] travail you are a religious
[1:08:46] person what makes the difference it is
[1:08:49] that travail of the
[1:08:51] Soul everybody goes to church it's a
[1:08:54] custom in the days we are living in and
[1:08:57] the Bible says they have form of
[1:09:00] godliness they just have form just they
[1:09:04] have a packaging of religious
[1:09:20] nameb only good

[1:09:50] way you you will get somewhere it is in
[1:09:53] prayer praise be to God and each time we
[1:09:56] come before God we must be losing
[1:09:58] something and gaining from God praise be
[1:10:02] to God when you come with 10 chains at
[1:10:06] least go with some are broken if not all
[1:10:08] of them but because we don't want to get
[1:10:12] a away like to get uh we always want to
[1:10:15] stand on God's way blessed be the name
[1:10:18] of the Lord because if you look at
[1:10:20] worship the worshiping in spirit or the
[1:10:23] true worship you have to get out of the
[1:10:26] way amen you have to tear this flesh you
[1:10:31] have to surrender your desire you have
[1:10:33] to surrender your

[1:11:20] aside and worship
[1:11:22] God Amen something think that they

[1:12:24] praying when
[1:12:27] okay fine I have the other day just
[1:12:30] today I was coming to church in the
[1:12:33] morning and I was passing VI the
[1:12:35] hospital and there was a lady she was
[1:12:38] undergoing birth
[1:12:50] pain because she was like moving around
[1:12:54] around the hospital comp
[1:12:56] there is something that was going

[1:13:06] amen so when you have soul
[1:13:10] travail that will push you to
[1:13:14] prayer
[1:13:15] amen and that's what we need praise to
[1:13:19] God
[1:13:25] knowing that when you come to church
[1:13:27] come because there is some Force inside
[1:13:30] you that pushes you to come for
[1:13:33] church when you're lifting your
[1:13:35] hands lift them
[1:13:39] up because you are not lifting it uh it

[1:14:12] was in and I was like you know when you
[1:14:16] go and meet a sick person that's when
[1:14:19] realize that you don't appreciate God
[1:14:23] enough he could hardly turn they just
[1:14:26] had to turn him he was in pain and you
[1:14:30] find a Believer seated in
[1:14:41] church but I'm speaking
[1:14:45] reality because the true
[1:14:48] worshippers Jesus say now the time has
[1:14:51] come when the true worshippers will
[1:14:54] worship God in Sp
[1:14:55] spirit and in the
[1:14:59] truth in the Old Testament they used to
[1:15:01] lift their
[1:15:03] hands they used to stand lift their
[1:15:06] hands but here Jesus says that now
[1:15:09] amen time has come they will no longer
[1:15:12] go to Mountain to worship but the true
[1:15:14] worshippers are going to worship that
[1:15:16] God in spirit and in
[1:15:19] truth and sometime when we look at
[1:15:22] ourself we wonder whether we are true
[1:15:24] worshippers oh we are
[1:15:30] Jokers you find them when they're out
[1:15:33] there they speak like machine
[1:15:38] guns
[1:15:48] from you even demonstrate your stories
[1:15:51] but let them come to church
[1:15:55] they are like wheelie
[1:16:01] barrows what is wrong where is the
[1:16:07] problem

[1:16:25] from God till you get desperate about
[1:16:29] it you will not get anything from God
[1:16:33] and I will not until you are
[1:16:36] desperate about it you will not even
[1:16:39] receive the Holy
[1:16:41] Spirit until you are desperate for
[1:16:46] it amen you will never even get a
[1:16:51] sister until you are desperate that's
[1:16:55] right you will never get anywhere in
[1:16:59] spirit until you are desperate amen play
[1:17:03] your games but I'm telling you this
[1:17:06] evening if we want to get somewhere we
[1:17:09] must be desperate amen
[1:17:13] amen we must be on our tip
[1:17:18] toes because that's where God want to
[1:17:21] meet
[1:17:23] us when Moses was raring the Sheep
[1:17:28] amen it was his daily routine every day
[1:17:32] go R the sheep and but God wanted to get
[1:17:36] Moses's
[1:17:38] attention and when Moses was there he
[1:17:41] saw the bush
[1:17:43] burning he became desperate because he
[1:17:45] had never seen something of that kind
[1:17:47] the bush is burning and it's not
[1:17:49] consumed blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:17:53] maybe Moses was playing all doing
[1:17:55] something but when he saw the bush
[1:17:58] burning he became desperate that
[1:18:01] attracted his attention and God said now
[1:18:03] that's where I want you that's where I
[1:18:05] wanted you blessed be the name of the
[1:18:07] Lord and he came anxiously wanting to
[1:18:11] know what was going on then the voice
[1:18:13] spke from the pillar of
[1:18:15] fire and told him Moses remove your
[1:18:19] shoes amen for the place where you are
[1:18:22] standing is a holy ground praise be to
[1:18:27] God but remember somebody was praying in
[1:18:34] Egypt and God through prayer God
[1:18:37] answered that prayer blessed be the name
[1:18:40] of the Lord amen this man had ran from
[1:18:44] Egypt and was
[1:18:46] hiding he was like in Exile and his
[1:18:49] father was still praying because he knew
[1:18:52] that Moses was going to be the Liberator
[1:18:55] but at God's appointed time blessed be
[1:18:58] the name of the Lord even when Moses ran
[1:19:01] away the Israel they never stopped
[1:19:05] praying those who had caught the vision
[1:19:08] they kept on praying blessed be the name
[1:19:10] of the Lord am
[1:19:13] amen and God was doing something praise
[1:19:17] be to God
[1:19:20] am and until God met Moses
[1:19:25] and you see here when God spoke to uh uh
[1:19:29] when God spoke to say he said that he
[1:19:31] spoke to Moses he told him that I have
[1:19:33] heard the Cry of my
[1:19:36] children blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:19:39] that cry was prayer so God always
[1:19:42] answers
[1:19:44] prayer don't forget a family prayer
[1:19:48] that's why Jesus want to meet
[1:19:50] us blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:19:53] here the prophet tells us in spiritual
[1:19:54] Amnesia no wonder the message spiritual
[1:19:57] Amnesia that you are not going to get
[1:19:59] anything from God until you get
[1:20:01] desperate about it how many things how

[1:30:53] he fall

[1:32:14] confusion of
[1:32:18] faces Daniel knew the language that God
[1:32:22] hears amen
[1:32:29] and indeed God answered his prayers

[1:32:53] fall seven times and rise again but
[1:32:56] again if you find a righteous man is
[1:32:58] bragging about falling I fall and Rise
[1:33:02] there is something

[1:33:09] progressive
[1:33:15] Journey amen
[1:33:30] then in Ephesians 6:10 tells us that

[1:36:39] God you see God design prayer in the way
[1:36:42] that nobody you have to pray for
[1:36:45] yourself
[1:36:52] percent even wives when they want to

[1:36:57] get somewhere in the spirit they pray
[1:36:59] for
[1:37:00] themselves you will pray for her you

[1:37:34] think your dad's prayer will give you
[1:37:36] the Holy Ghost he will plead with God

[1:37:56] receive the Holy Ghost unless you know
[1:37:58] why he was
[1:37:59] given and how will you know you have to
[1:38:02] read
