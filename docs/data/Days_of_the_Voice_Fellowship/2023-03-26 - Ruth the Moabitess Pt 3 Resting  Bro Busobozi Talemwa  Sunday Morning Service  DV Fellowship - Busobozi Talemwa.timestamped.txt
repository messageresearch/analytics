[8:17] have just been together even less than a
[8:19] month I

[23:05] our Kindred with whose maidens thou
[23:07] asked
[23:08] behold he will know with Bali tonight in
[23:12] the threshing floor wash thyself thereof
[23:14] and anoint thee and put thy remainment
[23:17] upon thee and get thee down onto the
[23:19] floor
[23:20] but make note thyself known unto the man
[23:23] until he shall have done eating and
[23:27] drinking and it shall be when he lies
[23:29] down that thou shalt Mark the place
[23:32] where he shall lie and thou shalt go in
[23:35] and uncover his feet and lay thee down
[23:38] and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do
[23:41] and she said unto her all that thou
[23:44] sayest unto me I will do and she went
[23:47] down unto the floor and did according to
[23:49] all that her mother-in-law paid her and
[23:51] when boas had eaten and drank
[23:54] and his heart was merry he went to lie
[23:57] down at the end of the Heap of corn and
[24:00] she came so softly and uncovered his
[24:03] feet and laid her down and it came to
[24:06] pass at midnight that the man was afraid
[24:08] and turned himself and behold a woman
[24:10] lay at his feet and he said who what
[24:13] though who at thou and she answered I am
[24:18] Ruth thine handmade spread their father
[24:21] is cut over thine handmaid for thou
[24:23] utter near Kinsman and he said blessed
[24:26] be thou the Lord my daughter for thou
[24:28] has showed more kindness in the latter
[24:30] end than at the beginning in as much as
[24:33] thou followest not younger men where the
[24:36] poor or Rich and now my daughter fear
[24:40] not I will do to thee all that thou
[24:43] requires for all the city of my people
[24:46] that know that thou art a virtuous woman
[24:49] and now it is true that I am like near
[24:52] Kinsman and how big there is a Kinsman
[24:54] near nearer than I tarry this night and
[24:57] it shall be in the morning that if he
[24:59] will perform unto thee the part of a
[25:01] king's man well let him do the king's
[25:04] man the king's man is part but if he
[25:06] will not do the part of a king's man to
[25:08] thee then will I do the part of a king's
[25:10] man to thee as the Lord liveth lie down
[25:13] until the morning and she lay at his
[25:16] feet until the morning and she rose up
[25:19] before one could know another and he
[25:22] said let it not be known that a woman
[25:24] came in to the floor also he said bring
[25:28] the veil that thou Hast upon thee and
[25:30] hold it and and when she held it he
[25:33] measured six measures of body and laid
[25:35] it on her and she went into the city
[25:37] praise the Lord
[25:40] Ruth the moabitus Lucy um today we are
[25:44] speaking on resting it's
[25:47] quite a lot that we can be able to
[25:50] be able to book really the Twins and
[25:55] in every service I've been able to cut
[25:56] it short but uh I've not been able to
[25:58] cover everything and
[26:01] that's
[26:03] why I'm requesting and I requested each
[26:04] of you to go and listen to the message
[26:06] the Kinsman reduced so
[26:11] I don't know how many have listened to
[26:12] it if
[26:15] you've not listened to eat please go and
[26:16] listen to the message it
[26:21] was preached in 1960 I
[26:25] heard someone say they didn't have a
[26:26] code for the message they called it
[26:27] 60-10-0-2
[26:30] I mean so go on please listen to it
[26:33] begins zero
[26:39] two all right so the king the Ruth the
[26:42] more about this is our subject and
[26:47] our topic today is
[26:50] so now we've seen that there are four
[26:53] phases of
[26:56] Ruth and we see this clear in the Book
[26:59] of Ruth and
[27:02] the first one is deciding the
[27:06] second one is working the
[27:09] third is resting
[27:12] is so
[27:16] we talked about Ruth deciding try again
[27:19] and of course we saw that Ruth is the
[27:22] type of the church and
[27:26] every man that comes to Jesus must
[27:30] decide to follow Jesus when
[27:34] you have no hope for things to be better
[27:36] but
[27:38] because you have made up your mind to
[27:42] follow Jesus you have faith in what he
[27:45] will do for you you
[27:48] have faith in Redemption but
[27:51] you have no proof of redemption do
[27:55] you know about every one of us needs to
[27:56] be redeemed every
[27:59] one of us the Bible says we were born in
[28:01] sin we
[28:03] come to the world speaking lies so
[28:07] we need to be redeemed so I will need to
[28:10] make a decision
[28:12] decision is the very first place now
[28:16] remember when you make a decision you
[28:19] still have the desires that you had
[28:21] before you
[28:23] still have the desires of the things of
[28:26] the world you
[28:28] still had everything that everybody else
[28:30] has in the world so
[28:33] you don't decide to follow Jesus because
[28:36] we have already overcome because
[28:39] you were Superman or a superwoman you
[28:43] decide to follow Jesus because
[28:46] you love him with everything in you amen
[28:51] so Ruth made her decision but
[28:55] all Pakistan Naomi
[28:58] and said and
[29:06] she said I'm sorry because at first at
[29:09] first both her and Ruth were saying no
[29:11] we shall follow it
[29:40] is highly unlikely she might become
[29:42] pregnant but
[29:47] even if she became pregnant it
[29:50] is highly unlikely have
[29:54] twins would
[29:57] have to be both boys so
[30:02] now when all pass out about it she
[30:05] said surely this way is unrealistic
[30:08] according
[30:11] to a thing and
[31:10] she was not ready to bet with her and
[32:07] make up that
[32:10] decision
[32:10] [Applause]
[32:12] foreign
[32:54] foreign
[33:02] [Applause]
[33:23] foreign
[33:50] you
[34:49] are in the field of describe not
[34:53] by coincidence
[34:55] Hallelujah
[34:57] and so
[34:58] at that moment Serge
[35:01] Hallelujah man Ruth Ruth began grinning
[35:09] boys his
[35:19] eyes you
[35:22] had many sisters
[35:23] we
[36:23] are going to foreign
[37:23] you see even if they're losing slap them
[37:25] together come
[37:28] on tell somebody until you tell somebody
[37:30] tell
[37:32] them you are Ruth what
[37:36] was she doing she was cleaning let
[37:43] me tell you any man that comes to the
[37:46] Lord must
[37:48] be willing to stop you
[37:51] cannot just sit in the church you
[37:57] cannot do that find something for
[38:04] the Lord amen
[38:06] song
[38:23] give your money why are you saying that
[38:25] is serving also if you can't do that on
[38:28] the streets if
[38:31] you can't do that pass the track to
[38:34] somebody there
[38:37] is more you can do for
[38:40] somebody to
[38:41] make yourself busy don't
[38:47] come here just to sit take care we come
[38:50] here to serve the Lord come
[38:56] and serve with me by saying amen by
[39:02] saying yes we
[39:05] are serving together you
[39:15] know told them leave something foreign
[39:23] his
[39:41] [Music]
[39:56] mercies are new
[39:59] foreign
[40:10] [Applause]
[40:30] that is why the Bible says one
[40:33] man said I've been oh I've been young
[40:34] and now I'm old I've
[40:38] never seen the righteous beg for praise
[40:40] let
[40:42] me tell you God
[40:45] may never give you all the things you
[40:47] ask for your
[40:49] name but one thing God will make sure
[40:51] that you have food
[40:54] hey
[40:57] yes
[41:07] not spiritually physically
[41:09] [Applause]
[41:11] that's
[41:14] what God promised you
[41:17] will not go to bed for chicken salad if
[41:21] you want chicken chicken
[41:25] foreign
[41:34] [Music]
[41:54] I
[41:57] might preaching to someone
[41:59] watch
[42:08] God make him two fish more we
[42:12] can multiply because they promise
[42:21] foreign
[43:14] and so Ruth the more about us here
[43:19] you say that you never went with other
[43:20] men one how you get them again
[43:28] did you know that a woman at the
[43:30] intention and the purpose of God listen
[43:32] Church did
[43:34] you know the purpose of God is
[43:42] for a girl to get married when she's
[43:45] still virtuous money
[43:53] that's the purpose of God in
[43:56] fact in the Old Testament there
[43:59] was no room for an uh a girl who was not
[44:02] virtuous to get married there
[44:08] was no room it
[44:10] was even difficult for a Girl Like Ruth
[44:12] was
[44:15] a virtuous but
[44:17] [Music]
[44:18] she was a widow she
[44:21] was known by another man so
[44:24] there was no way it
[44:29] had to be a man from
[44:32] The Lion age of the man that married her
[44:34] before that
[44:39] was called the Kinsman ridiculous
[44:42] meaning
[44:46] the Redeemer from the lineage of his of
[44:49] our former husband
[44:53] that's

[1:03:35] the truth damn I see me that's what the
[1:03:37] devil has made the woman with
[1:03:41] all the pornography and everything you
[1:03:43] have to say with all the sexuality that
[1:03:45] is out there naked
[1:03:47] women pictures of women I
[1:03:50] was even in the supermarket the other
[1:03:51] times it's
[1:03:53] a public place where
[1:03:56] little children go or one of them but
[1:03:59] because they are advertising bras a
[1:04:04] woman was only eating High insides and
[1:04:06] her brothers
[1:04:10] foreign
[1:04:50] for them to realize they're naked
[1:04:52] because
[1:04:55] if they act because the Bible say Bible
[1:04:58] again when evicts so
[1:05:03] let us pass a bunch of apples for
[1:05:07] them to realize amen
[1:05:14] people that are not going to compromise

[1:05:29] are your friends or your sisters are
[1:05:31] doing it it still is wrong stand

[1:05:37] the word when
[1:05:39] you stand for the world let me tell you
[1:05:42] what you're doing you are standing with
[1:05:45] with God himself
[1:05:50] and then you were sent out there to be a
[1:05:51] light you're
[1:05:55] not going to go and begin abusing them
[1:05:57] you
[1:05:59] know the day was deceived them some of
[1:06:01] them are children of God so
[1:06:04] what do we do we reach out to them are
[1:06:09] you hearing me we reach out to them
[1:06:11] because
[1:06:13] every girl is wearing lipsticks and
[1:06:18] painting their face it
[1:06:21] has come to a point where it is all
[1:06:23] right
[1:06:30] they think it is civilization thank
[1:06:35] God for the prophet that we have had in
[1:06:36] our generation he
[1:06:42] said it is the
[1:06:52] message going home
[1:06:55] some
[1:07:42] of them paint themselves like cats
[1:07:47] yes yes does it happen
[1:07:51] it is not money core pedico it's not
[1:07:53] those things see pedicure and a manicure
[1:07:55] it is traditional things being mean to
[1:07:57] be able but our Prophet are saying not
[1:08:00] your father it is one
[1:08:05] who doesn't know or worship Our God our
[1:08:10] God is Jesus Christ and
[1:08:14] it doesn't matter where it is done
[1:08:15] Switzerland
[1:08:21] could be in Germany not Germany if it is
[1:08:23] done it is and
[1:08:26] let me tell you no matter where it is
[1:08:27] these
[1:08:34] things were being done all over the
[1:08:35] world women
[1:08:37] have been painting themselves for ages
[1:08:39] that
[1:08:43] was before the new Christ in
[1:08:47] the Bible we see a woman called jeze
[1:08:51] she
[1:09:14] started you know influencing him to
[1:09:19] also worship she
[1:09:22] became a prophetess he
[1:09:25] became a lead of the armies and
[1:09:29] that's what the church has become today

[1:09:48] things our
[1:09:50] visitors today foreign
[1:10:07] why was Jezebel painting herself yes
[1:10:10] let's
[1:10:13] come down to that what
[1:10:16] was the reason
[1:10:20] can a woman paint herself and
[1:10:26] be in the bedroom the whole day
[1:10:32] um
[1:10:35] a woman paints herself so
[1:10:39] she can attract me
[1:10:43] if you have another reason you
[1:10:46] have to prove it
[1:10:49] but the real reason why
[1:10:53] a woman would paint herself yes
[1:11:03] that's why when they do that and
[1:11:06] they dress their their nude clothes then
[1:11:15] they don't say um I look sharp or I look
[1:11:17] smart am
[1:11:20] I success even
[1:11:25] when they take pictures this
[1:11:30] is really all meant to be sexy opposite
[1:11:34] in
[1:11:36] other words they'll try and come say
[1:11:38] come and help me and
[1:11:44] you notice whatever when Jezebel painted
[1:11:47] herself she
[1:11:50] would you know pain and then go in the
[1:11:51] mirror yesterday
[1:11:54] foreign
[1:12:12] yes
[1:12:16] she would just go there no they know her
[1:12:19] mouth her mouth is our lips are sticking
[1:12:21] out and imagine full
[1:12:24] of paint like blood and

[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:14:04] then she came out on
[1:14:07] the balcony
[1:14:10] and one man God anointed one man
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:21] foreign
[1:15:12] foreign
[1:15:23] the devil is doing it out there with a
[1:15:26] lot of strengths if
[1:15:30] I'm going to stand here I'm going to
[1:15:32] answer on the day of judgment I
[1:15:36] must say what the prophet says I
[1:15:39] must say what a Vindicated you
[1:15:45] know sometimes we try to be diplomats
[1:15:46] and
[1:15:48] I even Wonder Brothers
[1:15:52] The
[1:16:13] Church of Jesus Christ become
[1:16:16] painted first by
[1:16:19] painting themselves away from the world
[1:16:23] foreign
[1:16:36] and
[1:16:46] I know there are people here who believe
[1:16:47] exactly
[1:16:54] praise the name of the Lord
[1:17:00] cover yourself why
[1:17:03] would a woman want to uncover herself
[1:17:05] and
[1:17:07] I'm not saying oh the only right way of
[1:17:10] dressing is to dress things that are
[1:17:12] going sweeping the floor you
[1:17:19] know we also have legalism the
[1:17:26] only way you can make your hair is make
[1:17:27] it going behind it's
[1:17:32] a uniform for everyone that's
[1:17:40] not where anywhere in the Bible it's
[1:17:43] not even in the message that's
[1:17:54] our sisters
[1:17:57] foreign
[1:18:34] foreign
[1:19:13] but he's winnowing Bali you know and
[1:19:15] then he says listen brother wrong he
[1:19:17] says and then Mark the place Kathy where
[1:19:20] Kanye Wadi so Naomi was telling him he's
[1:19:24] saying and then he said to her she said
[1:19:26] to her and mark the place where he lies
[1:19:28] did
[1:19:32] you do it did
[1:19:36] you also Mark the place many
[1:19:45] years ago he said many years ago I
[1:19:47] marked that place in my heart where he
[1:19:50] laid down his life Jesus
[1:20:13] foreign
[1:21:13] let
[1:21:20] us Mark that place
[1:21:23] foreign
[1:22:12] foreign
[1:22:45] and worthy and
[1:22:53] take the blanket that
[1:22:56] he was covered and
[1:22:58] pull it over here
[1:23:01] what do you think was the blanket that
[1:23:03] covered Jesus
[1:23:12] sometimes I think about it I say oh God
[1:23:14] Like
[1:23:16] That Woman by
[1:23:21] your stripes Jesus
[1:23:28] amen
[1:23:42] when I think about that Brenda helped
[1:23:46] me to mark that yeah I'll
[1:23:53] accept your suffering I'll
[1:23:55] accept the Sorrows glory
[1:24:01] to God following
[1:24:05] Jesus is not like that it's
[1:24:10] a place of self denial
[1:24:21] dying to your desires everything
[1:24:27] that take you away from here maybe every
[1:24:31] day we have to die you
[1:24:33] say friends we have to accept to die
[1:24:37] we have to accept to do that and he says
[1:24:40] oh you see
[1:24:42] I say I know you may think that I'm a
[1:24:45] fanatic but
[1:24:48] that just suits me just right that's
[1:24:52] the spirit of God Calvary
[1:24:58] Calvary where he laid down in the Tomb
[1:25:00] we are gonna be the moon and
[1:25:05] crawl up to his face there
[1:25:14] you are cover yourself I
[1:25:28] wonder how many people can say the same
[1:25:29] thing what
[1:25:32] you say I will do and
[1:25:35] by the bottom say that Naomi was a type
[1:25:37] of the Old Testament
[1:25:42] whatever
[1:25:48] you
[1:25:53] say I will do
[1:25:56] and and then he says it says repent and
[1:25:59] be baptized in
[1:26:01] the name of Jesus Christ and you say I
[1:26:03] will do it how many can say I will do it
[1:26:06] if
[1:26:08] it says going into the world and preach
[1:26:09] the gospel you
[1:26:12] say I will do them and get you courage
[1:26:14] if it says whatever it said Jesus Christ
[1:26:17] the same yesterday you
[1:26:21] say I will still come and get you
[1:26:23] courage the church taking its orders
[1:26:25] from the world
[1:26:48] and I want to bring you to a climax now
[1:26:50] we
[1:26:52] talk about the rest before we conclude
[1:26:53] but listen to this quote as I finish
[1:26:55] this quote from this message look
[1:26:58] this is it the church the young woman
[1:26:59] the young man the old or young is asked
[1:27:02] to separate themselves from the world
[1:27:04] and come into a place a kingdom of the
[1:27:06] Holy ghosts that
[1:27:18] is disgraceful to the world in
[1:27:21] their own heart they know what it's all
[1:27:23] about but
[1:27:26] to the world they become a fanaticians
[1:27:29] they become a Holy Roller or something
[1:27:31] on that idea not disgraceful name that's
[1:27:38] why listen listen church that's what I
[1:27:40] always say you see when we come to
[1:27:43] church if
[1:27:45] you've really lie down to that place
[1:27:48] Missouri
[1:27:58] you see you must come to that place or
[1:28:00] do not do come with you where when you
[1:28:02] worship God when
[1:28:04] you hear the word you yield yourself so
[1:28:07] much that
[1:28:09] even tears will come down you
[1:28:12] not be ashamed of him
[1:28:15] but you see what we what do we have now
[1:28:17] we have a put on religion we
[1:28:22] have a very diplomatic religion and
[1:28:25] I say even in the message where
[1:28:28] you just have to hear and just sit there
[1:28:30] and be dry as dry can be prayers
[1:28:35] as just as dry yes when
[1:28:40] you check the some when you check the
[1:28:42] temperature it
[1:28:44] is zero temperature nobody
[1:28:47] in the church can even shout Glory
[1:28:48] Hallelujah when
[1:28:51] the what is going on everybody's just
[1:28:53] dry nobody
[1:28:59] can even raise their voice no
[1:29:02] nobody can do that because it is how
[1:29:14] can they see a very a very interesting
[1:29:17] beautiful young lady shouting
[1:29:22] you
[1:29:32] know so but that what what is happening
[1:29:35] it's the wrong Spirit creeping in dry
[1:29:40] us up but
[1:29:42] what does Jesus want us to do he
[1:29:45] wants us to rest at his feet the
[1:29:48] rest is the Holy Ghost comes
[1:29:52] these
[1:29:54] things are bound to happen let
[1:29:57] me tell you when the Holy Ghost is in a
[1:29:59] church am
[1:30:09] I preaching to someone here we are going
[1:30:11] to see people running around the eyes
[1:30:15] the people crying around the tears like
[1:30:18] babies it
[1:30:21] is not emotion it is the work on the
[1:30:24] inside that
[1:30:26] is being reflected on the outside what
[1:30:30] are you going to see you're going to see
[1:30:32] mucus coming up you're
[1:30:35] not gonna have time to create yourself
[1:30:36] why
[1:30:38] why because you are so lost this
[1:30:56] is what the church is supposed to happen
[1:30:58] that
[1:31:00] is praise
[1:31:06] the name of the Lord and he says no
[1:31:09] matter by the church is asked to do it
[1:31:11] the
[1:31:13] church is
[1:31:15] don't
[1:32:11] make one bit of difference to me
[1:32:14] this
[1:33:10] oh my God
[1:33:12] stammering lips stammering
[1:33:16] lips and
[1:33:19] then he will say to them this
[1:33:23] you know what this that you have
[1:33:25] received Hallelujah
[1:33:27] is the rest in
[1:33:34] your church this
[1:33:36] is the refresh but
[1:33:39] what did they do they didn't hear it
[1:33:41] acts
[1:33:43] chapter 2 verse where
[1:34:11] they were sitting
[1:34:12] foreign
[1:34:28] Holy
[1:34:30] Ghost foreign
[1:35:26] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:35:30] oh my in a message the unfailing
[1:35:34] realities of the Living God the
[1:35:38] Bible says this
[1:35:48] is the thing that will come
[1:35:51] foreign
[1:36:18] foreign
[1:36:46] now I want to conclude today with
[1:36:51] the example of the woman with the
[1:36:53] alabaster box and
[1:36:59] instead of reading that scripture I'll
[1:37:00] just record this quote brother speaks
[1:37:02] about her uh
[1:37:05] unwelcomed
[1:37:09] Christ the
[1:37:13] prophet says the only decent thing she
[1:37:14] had about her was her long hair
[1:37:18] um and
[1:37:22] it fell down
[1:37:23] wiping
[1:37:41] his feet then
[1:37:52] was the last time amen your tears came
[1:37:55] out to wash Jesus's feet oh
[1:38:07] God I'm so wretched I'm so miserable and
[1:38:13] our Glory laying right at his feet she
[1:38:17] was wiping the feet off Glory
[1:38:20] negatively watching what a picture
[1:38:23] Jesus
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:39:23] don't
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:40:04] you see what this poor prostitute was
[1:40:06] doing
[1:40:10] you know here's what I strongly believe
[1:40:12] it's
[1:40:14] not about what you have done in the past
[1:40:15] Italian
[1:40:18] I'm so sorry it has come to a place
[1:40:20] where
[1:40:22] our churches are looking for perfect
[1:40:24] people um but
[1:40:29] God is Not Looking for perfect day
[1:40:32] God is looking for people like
[1:40:35] this woman but
[1:40:39] she was ready on
[1:40:44] the feet of Jesus that's what you have
[1:40:47] in our churches that
[1:40:51] are so stretchy so
[1:40:55] holier than thou attitude of
[1:41:04] the attitude that this woman even
[1:41:09] when we go to worship this
[1:41:16] thing has disappeared
[1:41:18] let it be restored again to us this
[1:41:22] is what God is looking for he
[1:41:25] wants us little Ruth to rest at his feet
[1:41:34] help us
[1:41:37] and he says what has happened to the
[1:41:39] Past Church to say
[1:41:46] he said she was laying Everything At His
[1:41:49] Feet she
[1:41:52] wanted him to be welcome
[1:41:56] God help me to help to let him be
[1:41:58] welcome what
[1:42:01] has happened to the party the party here

[1:42:05] church service

[2:17:05] [Music]
[2:17:13] [Music]
[2:17:26] [Music]
[2:17:30] hey many may be seated for just a moment
[2:17:33] so
[2:17:36] before before we dismiss I just wanted
[2:17:38] to uh throw this uh two announcements uh
[2:17:45] on Sunday to those of you who are here
[2:17:47] we had a Minister's uh not only
[2:17:50] ministers but also the sisters who help
[2:17:52] and and and so the meeting here avatari
[2:17:56] works Sunday with Davao it is another
[2:17:58] child about we but
[2:18:01] um
[2:18:03] we received a notice from the landlord
[2:18:05] and
[2:18:09] he he was increasing our rent really
[2:18:16] the truth is God gave us this place and
[2:18:22] we all knew it was worth much more than
[2:18:25] we were asked to pay yeah same
[2:18:29] results if
[2:18:33] it was possible in the beginning we
[2:18:35] would have paid for five years up front
[2:18:36] because we knew maybe we're gonna be
[2:18:37] here three or five years it is but
[2:18:45] we did not have all those funds so
[2:18:50] we paid a few months and
[2:18:54] uh so now we receive the notice Katina
[2:18:57] that is increasing the rent he is 1.2
[2:19:03] million yeah and
[2:19:08] so we called him in here and sat with
[2:19:12] him and
[2:19:14] we told him that we would his place is
[2:19:17] worth that money is
[2:19:20] but
[2:19:23] most of our Reagans are young people
[2:19:25] students
[2:19:28] and so we can't afford that at this time
[2:19:30] long
[2:19:34] story short we agreed with him that we
[2:19:37] would going forward pay 800 000
[2:19:39] Shillings we
[2:19:45] do not know when we pay how long we pay
[2:19:48] whether he will change his mind again or
[2:19:50] not so
[2:19:56] there are two things I want to tell you
[2:19:57] one because be
[2:20:00] more serious on our land contributions
[2:20:03] so
[2:20:07] that way just to go and have our own
[2:20:08] place
[2:20:12] and then again we thought it is wise for
[2:20:16] us to pay at least at least six months
[2:20:20] to a yeah so
[2:20:31] that we know that if we pay for Aya we
[2:20:34] are not going to be disturbed we can
[2:20:35] collect our Churchland fund and then we
[2:20:37] don't know what the Lord will do within
[2:20:39] a year if within a year from now we have
[2:20:41] enough we can go to our land if not then
[2:20:43] at least we have we have had enough time
[2:20:46] to collect more funds for our Churchland
[2:20:47] yeah
[2:20:49] foreign
[2:20:57] do we understand each other so
[2:21:02] we have two options we
[2:21:06] collect
[2:21:07] what we need would be about 9.6 Millions
[2:21:18] foreign
[2:21:25] [Music]
[2:21:40] [Music]
[2:21:53] so
[2:21:56] that means we are remaining with 8.4
[2:21:58] Millions so
[2:22:01] I'm announcing it to you this
[2:22:04] is usually a free will offering but
[2:22:08] I'd like you to know that if we do not
[2:22:11] if we do not if we don't give yeah as
[2:22:16] a church by the end of this month we
[2:22:18] shall be forced to take it to take the
[2:22:20] 8.4 out of our church landforms so
[2:22:31] the match you give towards the rent to
[2:22:35] produce how much we will be able to take
[2:22:37] out of that funds so
[2:22:42] next month we shall give you a report
[2:22:44] according to your giving on where on the
[2:22:46] status where we shall see you
