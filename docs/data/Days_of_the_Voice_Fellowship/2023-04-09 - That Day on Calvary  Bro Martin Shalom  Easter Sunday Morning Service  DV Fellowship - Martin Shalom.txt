[Music] amen and amen shall return to our Bibles and read the book of Matthew chapter 27 to be created by Buddy amen Matthew 27 and Mateo is [Music] then we read 27 27 beginning from 27. today if you're there you say Amen amen when the soldiers of the cabinet took Jesus into the common Hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers and they striped him and put on him as Scarlett Rob and when they had uh platted a crown of thorn and they put it upon his head and read in his right hand and they ball and they bowled the knees before him and mock him saying hail King of the Jews and they split upon him and took the raid and smote him on the head and after they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put him on Remnant on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of seren Simon by name him they call they compelled to bear his cross and when they were come into a place called Golgotha that is to say a place of skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with girl and when he had tested thereof he would not drink and they crucified him and parted His Garment and cast lots and that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they spotted my garment among them and upon my vesture did they cast Lords and sitting down they watched him there and set up over his head his uh his accusation written G that this is Jesus the king of the Jews then where then where their two thieves crucified with him one on his right hand and another on his left hand and they and they that passed by revealed him wicking their head saying thou that thou saying thou that destroyed the temple and built it in three days save thyself though if thou be the Son of God come down from the cross likewise as the thief as the chief priest mocking him with the scribes and Elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him is basically basically Bo our silica level yes [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] and he trusted in God let him deliver him so deliver him now if he will save him for he said I am the Son of God then the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in their teeth in his teeth now from the sixth hour there was Darkness all over the land and to the ninth hour at about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli Lamas that is to say my God my God why has Thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they had that said this man calleth for Elias and straight away one Reign and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on on a reed and gave him to drink the rest said let be let us see whether a lie yes will come down and save him Jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the fail of the temple was rent in train from the top to the bottom and the art did quick and The Rock went the grave were open and many bodies of the saints that slept a rose and came out of the Grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now when the saint hiron and they that were with him watching Jesus so the earthquake and and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of God oh what a phenomenal Lord [Applause] precious Lord come on we have read what transpired that day that even the very men who crucified they ended up concluding saying that true truth this was the son may the same same God you rose from the dead living without me that will come this morning that you said you will heal the broken house blessed with the name of the Lord yeah today we are going to share the message called that day on College it was preached in 1609-25 um it's one of the powerful the most the wonderful message that you will listen and you listen again and again and again foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] all those kind of stuff blessed with the name of the Lord En Rose from prophets amen [Applause] remember when man sin in the Garden of Eden God gave them his wife and when man died there was that total separation from God but we're back before the beginning [Applause] but when sin came in human race [Applause] blessed with the name of the Lord foreign and the Bible talks of all of those great men sweat Warrior of Faith the great Heroes your face all of them they had their ends blessed be the name of the Lord here we are seeing Jesus [Music] [Music] to say to give himself many times they tried him and he just escaped in there you remember when he went to the temple I believe he had a very hot sermon he found men exchanging money but Jesus but if those people had power at that moment they were they could manage him you know people and money but Jesus time had not come but here now is blessed be the name of the Lord was time not to give him songs and we were seeing how they took him and I was crucified [Music] and I'm going to learn so much in this message the proper says that it seems like it would be a little out of season [Applause] the other should be that if this should be on Good Friday um and we have heard so much about it read so much about it since the beginning of time yeah amen amen ities you would have called angels to come to your restaurant but you knew Seekers have sang about told it but four thousand years before it ever happened the prophet of this day point back to when it did happen uh it is one of the most important day of of all the day that God ever let down uh let uh down on the Earth [Applause] amen amen California one of the most important days and even it's so important to the human race I'm sure it is we are seeking every importance of God that we can do now and all that we can find out we are here to learn or to learn of it to see what it's for us what promise to do for us amen and that is what we come to church for foreign [Applause] we don't come here to entertain one another question you sir we don't come here to meet one another let us examine Calvary this morning that's why we study and meditate in the scriptures [Applause] our Menace as a public servant folk to God where is trying to find something that will that God would have to say to his people that may help them but to help them to rise up to serve the Lord and the minister should seek this thing um we are strangers foreign [Applause] [Applause] in him and I pray I pray that it will condemn every sinner that is presentation it is my prayer as well yes and it will make every saint go on his knees three things it will make every sinner for them every single that is present here it will make every saint go on his knees that will make every sick person raise his faith to God and walk away everybody come back to God every saint rejoice and take new hold a new hope that is one of the greatest important thing that Calvary means to us the same question was foreign others looking at Jesus on the cross and they just sympathize with him look they're beating him they are going to pierce him God does not want you to feel pity for him and this last Friday everywhere the washing Passion of Christ Passion of Christ from there they go to bars foreign [Applause] to pay for foreign there is no rich man on us who can even buy one world but one Soul that's all of yours that you are playing with just worth a thousand words [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord amen no man could repair it is [Music] they could not find anybody on Earth no one could pay for our sins but one day blessed with the name of the Lord your sin did not start on Earth sin started in heaven Guru Lucifer Lucifer the devil was condemned creature for Disobedience for his Disobedience before he ever strike before he ever strike the Earth sin begins in heaven where God put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings they were supposed to decide by themselves who they will support you see that's how how simple our God is and there was a requirement for sin the requirement was death each one is that we could go into greatest detail of this because I do not believe that there is but one death [Applause] [Music] spoken word is original remember he preached a message called Saturn is but before that when Adam was in Eden Adam he says agama Adam could communicate with even animals God created and Adam gives them Adam and when God called Adams he service it came moving and then God maybe God will sit at someone he looked at it and he said big news because Adam was then God showed them another box pure white name say that one will be a crane among others and others cows and other animals in somewhere he said that Adam he was the Master of the of the camera because sin came on us shall be the name of the Lord but here you say that when sin strike the Earth in the beginning like a black that like like a sheet of Blackness falling from Heaven foreign foreign [Music] therefore when man realized that he was separated from God remember the Bible tells us in Hebrews putting on ships they're looking for a city amen they were not looking for Kampala not New York City do you know that when we're in the village and then we came to Kampala we thought ah it's now okay institutions oh it's a county that has peace which can satisfy man America is God himself amen amen that's where we are learning from where the glory of God shines forever you will never be satisfied on this Earth until you enter that City blessed be the name of the Lord through the mountains back in his prayer in the presence of God he could talk it over with him no problem there was no way back God became lost he didn't know took out and wondering trying find something else that could find a way back to that place even today what they're trying to do trying to find a resting place and that is Christ Jesus Christ amen blessed place this is not a person here owners visible audience this morning okay oh sorry something was inside of him told him that he came from a place that was perfect there is not a place perfect here they are building Bankers they are build policies but still they feel they are not secure something in their heart tell us amen there is not a puff not a person here in this visible audience this morning oh okay sorry you have got your bills to pay you think that will settle it when you got your bills paid then somebody sick in your family you have just paid school fees and then you say somebody as you're relaxing they tell you your wife is sick she's just from those and then your father has fallen he has broken his leg and then you want to you want to be back young again amen that is the reason many times today that a sinner is still wondering about aliens a beautiful young girl will cut off the locks of her hair to be popular paint up her face mask put on her clothes to show the form of her being because it's the only thing that she can find she can finding somewhere to try to find something to come back to her when she can cause men to whistle after her young man will do the same thing to women tries to make himself attractive to her neighbors will build a house and fix it a certain way you might think it is there is this rope that is for pulling uh heavy metals in factories neighbor will build a house my client was telling me after every over two years what is the problem but every afternoon fixing a certain way because it looks a little bit better than his neighbors it is all the time we are seeking for something but it is sometimes and something keeps going on just just little above it is a young lady is more popular than she um the neighbor will find a house that looks better than his the woman will find another woman dressed a certain way that looks better than oh my gosh it is something in us that is seeking out for something and it shows that we are lost we're waiting to move we want to find out something and bring us to the satisfaction together we want to fight we want to find something that will bring us to that satisfaction that will face that spot of hunger in there but seems like we can't find it styles are like styles nowadays they put on tight trousers until I always wonder how they remove it when they was like you need to get a hold of a pill and someone pulls you pull me uh sometimes you find mothers you may think that it is meant when it is you look at Allah you look at them skin and the dress the gene when it is almost the same human being trying Through the Ages they wept for it they they cried but he done everything that they could know but still they couldn't find it wandering about through the world Amen they have tried everything they started here it's small but when it reaches down here it is huge like a skirt that did not work time before the jeans came in genius if you never put on feather during our day that was the style talk of hairstyles [Music] [Music] foreign blessed be the name of the Lord remember we are talking about that town but I did something I'm Gonna Change Jesus yes you set you free amen and tell the devil I am free now listen here he says finally one day again there was one came down from Glory by the name of Jesus Christ the son of God Hallelujah foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign and the devil was the champion but God Was preparing let me tell you brother maybe things are not yet right in this Laboratories [Music] [Music] that was antidote which was formed by God once forever [Applause] God cannot inject you twice foreign [Music] why are you living in sin you don't want to part with the devil's sins and you want to go to the tables how shall we escape foreign [Music] [Music] Jesus knew that with father God to get lost your will be done and I believe God was happy [Music] the price was paid the Bible says which did not hold their blesses foreign blessed be the name of the Lord the gospel is not supposed to be handled with gloves Heaven belongs to God's word we have no heaven for our children my father had no heaven for me and when we believe the gospel do not even Force us into it he always showed us the right way yeah amen that's why sometime when we are taking God's things for granted you even wonder whether we know where we are going we know where we came from or we know what we are doing no minister of heaven heaven belongs to God I did not die for you never died for us our Bishops never die for oh I don't know my Bishop is Jesus Christ Jesus who died for me yes amen amen amen amen the price was it was so heavy blessed be the name of the Lord Oh Glory Hallelujah he said the sin question was settled once again you are living in sin because you want because you chose to live in sins foreign there is no man that ever visit Calvary and seen it the way it was that can ever be the same again there is no man to any moon tonight let me tell you even when Pope NE Papa when a Vista California blessed in the name of the Lord no man no woman one day there was a woman who met Jesus was a prostitute yes everything that happened that he ever desired oh long before it met when he reaches that place it was such an important day and such an important thing it is shook the world like never before when Jesus died at Calvary pay the sin questions went down in the middle of the day it's a rather nervous frustration in german yes [Music] what it did what did it do God settled in California the animal called Saturn [Music] foreign this is not a it's not a scratch the devil has beaten and they took the hunt and they broke the backbone amen amen by the as we speak now Devil's Backbone was just tied up by cell tip what am I trying to say you know where to beat when you're fighting with all your opponents and he realized he has a wound somewhere don't beat the head amen you comments you will be twice [Music] Jesus yes when he came down oh glory to God that animal was wounded foreign no amen now he'd been he been more vicious since then because it brought light to the human race and anyone knows that the wounded animal is the most vicious crawling around with his back broke [Applause] no Saturn was kicked out the art was very that way that the Earth was proved that it was the greatest price that was ever paid and the only one that could pay it came and done it at Calvary which is where the greatest price was paid that's one of the greatest things God had required it the Earth was undergoing operation foreign and the devil was unconscious hallelujah amen the guy was unconscious blessed with the name of the Lord amen this is so marvelous amen Amina [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord amen Amina God in human flesh he was dying it was the hour that the world looked foreign there was spin there was there many signposts that pointed to that day secrets and all these things [Music] which once walked Christians up up and down again [Applause] that cold off when Jesus died at the cross bleached forth out of the Earth in justices foreign in the presence of God when with his sin forgiveness our sins are forgiven no more Consultants off from God I will see this forgiveness amen the devil cannot [Music] it is illegal for Christian to carry your sin menu it is illegal for you to work with your sins amen because Jesus paid for your sins prepared for your big story you can live a holy life you can live a virtuous blessed with the name of the Lord you know when you met that Calvary my wife used to tell how she used to love dancing music but when she met Calvary hallelujah hallelujah she's a changing woman even if you put clubs around we can't even shake the head amen amen inside your heart she will be singing someone to wash my sins away [Music] now I'll run you soon Amazing Grace all the day long Christ Jesus made the sin I could never be [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign you blessed with the name of the Lord there is a line to Glory bringing every person

mean we are not born with 30 years and I believe I'm still a young man by the way but we stood not because we are strong not that we never made mistakes but every time I made a mistake that is where
