[37:35] thank you

[38:22] Jesus for
[38:25] our
[38:42] amen uh I want to mute you all in the
[38:46] name of Jesus
[38:48] Christ amen
[38:52] Amen brother can you please change your
[38:55] seat
[39:02] you okay you enjo
[39:06] this maybe I was
[39:10] mistaken now before we get started
[39:14] today I want to say
[39:16] that I am not
[39:18] happy I'm not
[39:21] happy because of
[39:24] uh the way we are
[39:29] progressively reducing our effort and
[39:32] reducing our
[39:34] seriousness to the cause which we
[39:37] decided to embark
[39:40] on uh you know the Bible the scripture
[39:42] says that whatever your hand finds to
[39:46] do do it with all your heart
[39:50] whatever now if it is bad do all
[39:54] your if it is good good do it with all
[39:57] your heart but whatever your hand finds
[40:00] to do do it with
[40:03] all many of you are students and at this
[40:06] time there is no school because there is
[40:09] lockdown in the
[40:10] country so what is it that you are doing
[40:14] now that's more important than this
[40:16] Bible study honestly I don't see
[40:19] any I must only
[40:22] appreciate brother
[40:25] oo brother
[40:27] and Jo who try to keep time
[40:30] today the rest of you I know by the
[40:33] shame and po at church but you also
[40:37] arrived here quite late you you arrived
[40:40] on time not in time you're supposed to
[40:43] arrive 30 minutes earlier so you can be
[40:45] able to get into the spirit of the
[40:47] service because when you arrive late
[40:49] then you are not you know you're not
[40:51] oriented well for
[40:53] the for the for the service
[40:57] the was fting seriously with with the
[41:00] machines when he supposed to be starting
[41:02] to do that about 30 minutes ear or even
[41:06] 1
[41:07] hour this is not acceptable I see even
[41:11] those of you
[41:12] sister got
[41:14] here about minutes
[41:19] late same thing you also got got on a
[41:22] bit late I think you were the last to
[41:25] get on Zoom this is not
[41:29] acceptable why because we given our
[41:35] time you know I wanted to imagine how
[41:40] much how much that
[41:44] goes into
[41:46] preparation look even this is still
[41:49] veryy looking for the things supposed to
[41:52] be looking for quite quite
[41:55] early
[41:57] friends praise the
[42:00] Lord praise the Lord
[42:02] again this is not
[42:05] acceptable this is not AC acceptable
[42:09] last last service I think we also AIT
[42:11] late some not talk about it but I
[42:16] think right to talk about it during this
[42:24] time are you here
[42:26] yes because if we are going to do this
[42:29] in a productive way we must be ready to
[42:32] sacrifice our old to it for us to be
[42:35] able to benefit mutually out of it uh
[42:40] you know those of
[42:42] you uh who have been a bit close to me
[42:46] you know have been not very
[42:50] perfectly perfect in my health
[42:52] personally because of the much strain
[42:55] these meetings are having with me you
[42:57] know Tuesday Wednesday Friday Sunday and
[43:02] it's not only during the program but
[43:04] also during the before because I have to
[43:07] prepare myself also do think that I just
[43:10] walk away from whatever I was doing and
[43:11] I just come here I have to sit down
[43:13] prepare pray you understand so and then
[43:17] all of the sudden you come and people
[43:18] are late 30 minutes late 20 minutes this
[43:21] is unacceptable it's unacceptable so the
[43:25] Zeal that you we must continue or else
[43:29] we should not do this at all if we want
[43:32] the lord to bless us out of this we
[43:35] should really be in for it we should be
[43:38] serious about it h to the extent that
[43:42] one two I don't see two people here you
[43:45] know either they are late or they
[43:49] are or they are not coming at all you
[43:52] see so which means they do not take it
[43:55] serious
[43:57] I would rather have a Bible study or a
[43:59] church age book
[44:00] study with two people when they really
[44:03] into it they are really seeing how it is
[44:06] blessing their lives they seeing how
[44:09] much it is impacting them you know than
[44:12] having a whole group of 20 plus when are
[44:15] not serious how many agree with what I'm
[44:18] saying so all of you practically agree
[44:21] then that means let us change let us
[44:23] change let us be serious if you're going
[44:26] to connect
[44:27] online and you know you need to have
[44:31] brother K help you get connected contact
[44:34] him 30 minutes before the service remind
[44:37] him 20 minutes at least 10 minutes
[44:40] before the service you should be
[44:42] connected
[44:44] then uh promptly at the time that we
[44:47] agreed I am always here I start the
[44:49] service always on time and so uh I think
[44:54] we really need to change on that we need
[44:55] to repent we need to repent of our
[44:59] sins how many are willing to repent how
[45:02] many are willing to repent for
[45:05] sure go go God bless you if you're
[45:07] willing to repent sister PE are you
[45:11] willing because those who are not
[45:13] willing to repent we shall not allow
[45:16] them to partake of this meeting you know
[45:20] I want it to be that we are in one
[45:22] Accord one
[45:24] spirit you see if someone comes like
[45:27] that 30 minutes late when we have
[45:30] covered almost half a chapter what
[45:33] should we do brother okay if we had
[45:37] started promply on our time 3 p.m.
[45:40] someone walks in like that what we do we
[45:43] just ch them we tell them brother God
[45:47] bless you Sister God bless you but you
[45:49] have come too late because whatever we
[45:51] have covered we have to cover it again
[45:54] and that is not acceptable so that's why
[45:56] we lay the service today to wait for
[45:59] everyone to be around so that now we can
[46:02] get into the more important things you
[46:04] see even I'm not happy at all with this
[46:07] brother who is working on this as well
[46:10] you know because I believe that you need
[46:15] to arrive on time prepare very well
[46:17] whatever is not working well you already
[46:19] know it in
[46:22] time so well I hope that that message
[46:25] has reach home can we now get into
[46:30] business uh brother Marvin thank you for
[46:33] the
[46:35] prayer
[46:41] now

[47:08] um yeah brother Sam and brother
[47:13] brother just found me having finished re
[47:17] those who are coming late and we agree
[47:20] that those who walk in late again we
[47:23] will not allow them to be a part of this
[47:25] program
[47:27] I want to believe that youate because
[47:29] youon as well it is unacceptable to come
[47:34] minutes the Bible
[47:42] stud

[51:34] testimony is that
[51:37] okay I want to read you a
[51:40] testimony
[51:42] regarding what
[51:44] happened
[51:47] with a
[51:50] pastor one of the elders now in this
[51:54] message and what it is that the Lord did
[51:57] through his
[51:59] life and how this
[52:02] book impacted his
[52:05] life praise the Lord amen and some of
[52:10] you have already been
[52:11] blessed with the
[52:14] services in their Church You' watched it

[52:28] placed a few if you remind me after this
[52:31] service I'll give you a clip and you
[52:34] really enjoy their worship so and and so
[52:38] just before we started this meeting this
[52:40] meeting here he shared with me a
[52:43] testimony and uh he was saying that uh
[52:47] he said he said by the vers it was
[52:51] 1965 at
[52:54] the meetings one of the meetings that
[52:56] babanam preached in a place called
[53:01] sh in the in the USA he attended those
[53:06] meetings so he says his family that's
[53:10] where they their family first got this
[53:13] book of course he was young at the time
[53:17] you listen to this testimony you really
[53:20] enjoyed so he says shortly thereafter we
[53:23] left the IND
[53:26] dependent free from organization
[53:29] Pentecostal church and began as a family
[53:33] to read the church ede book as a
[53:36] what so him and his family started to
[53:40] read the church book this
[53:44] book this one he and his family like we
[53:48] are also one big family right yes but
[53:51] now we are from also different families
[53:54] but for them as a family
[53:55] they were reading this
[53:58] book sitting in our living room just
[54:01] like we SE in our living room
[54:05] here on Sunday because they have just
[54:09] started you know getting into the
[54:11] message we would
[54:14] each read a
[54:17] paragraph As
[54:19] each took their turn
[54:23] reading and as I read that I was like my
[54:26] I think we can do something like that
[54:28] today I was inspired I felt like we can
[54:30] do something like that today we've been
[54:32] doing something close to that but I
[54:34] think we can do something like that
[54:35] today right yes at that time I was 11
[54:39] years old who's 11 today oh s here okay
[54:44] so the video is off the people who are
[54:46] on here canister oh yeah I can see over
[54:49] there but by the shame there's quite a
[54:51] bit of Darkness there so no one can
[54:54] see can you raise up your
[54:57] hand okay up up up up yes that's his
[55:00] sister Rachel over there she's 11 years
[55:03] old so this brother at that time was
[55:06] also 11
[55:08] years for other services he
[55:13] says we would often play a tape of
[55:17] brother bham brother bham or someone
[55:21] would preach you know sometimes they
[55:23] would play A T or someone would preach
[55:25] in 1968 who was born
[55:39] then in
[55:41] 1968 none of us was born there we moved
[55:45] from the city of Bia which was separated
[55:47] fromport by a river to farm about an
[55:51] hour drive
[55:54] away I turned 14 that year are you
[56:01] hearing although I had given my life to
[56:03] Christ at
[56:05] 5 right around that time I was baptized
[56:08] and filled with the Holy
[56:11] Ghost so if you are not yet baptized get
[56:13] baptized if you not yet filled with the
[56:15] holy ghost seek the Holy Ghost be filled
[56:17] with the Holy
[56:18] Ghost in February 1970 before I turned
[56:22] 16 in September I started
[56:25] fulltime Ministry you know what fulltime
[56:28] Ministry
[56:29] means what does it
[56:33] mean
[56:37] huh yeah but what exactly does it
[56:42] mean so you people don't know what
[56:44] Ministry
[56:46] means
[56:50] means
[56:53] yes yes
[56:55] he gave his entire time to
[56:57] fulltime to fulltime Min just like me I
[57:01] have fulltime Ministry I do fulltime
[57:03] Ministry fulltime Ministry is when you
[57:04] are not employed in another secular job
[57:07] but when you are yielding all your time
[57:09] to the ministry to the work of the Lord
[57:11] to the work of of the of the ministry
[57:13] are you following me yes so he says when
[57:16] he became 16 by that time he entered
[57:19] into fulltime Ministry so who is 16
[57:22] here who 16
[57:26] my God at your age he went into fulltime
[57:29] Ministry he became a
[57:32] preacher and he yielded all his time to
[57:35] do just that think about
[57:38] it I started fulltime Ministry so in
[57:41] 1972 who was born there still no
[57:45] one in
[57:47] 1972 I along with other family members
[57:51] moved from our
[57:52] home meetings to an old abandoned church
[57:57] building and and evening light
[57:59] Tabernacle as we know it today started
[58:02] that's their Church in
[58:05] 1976 while teaching on the church Ed
[58:09] book while teaching on the what if you
[58:12] raise it
[58:13] up while teaching on the church this
[58:16] very book he was reading it and teaching
[58:18] from
[58:20] this for the people right yes the ho
[58:24] ghost
[58:26] and my wife received the baptism of the
[58:30] Holy
[58:32] Ghost after that series of teaching a
[58:36] number of years later I went through it
[58:38] again teaching it paragraph
[58:43] by the church Ed is a wonderful doctrin
[58:48] correct book
[58:51] amen the devil has done what he can to
[58:53] discredit it
[58:55] but it remains one of the most important
[58:58] tools that we have at our disposal
[59:01] because it contains most of the
[59:03] fundamental doctrines of the message the
[59:06] Lan age I am so thankful hallelujah amen
[59:12] praise the Lord amen so I thought I
[59:15] should share this testimony of brother
[59:17] team because he is talking of years
[59:21] before we were born and it did them good
[59:25] if he did them good then if God was good
[59:27] then he's still good all the time if God
[59:31] was good then is good today so if people
[59:35] were filled with the Holy Ghost people
[59:37] were delivered you understand people
[59:39] receive the revelation of the word while
[59:41] studying the word the same word we have
[59:44] has not change the same Bible they had
[59:46] then it has not it is the same today so
[59:49] if we really stud it with all our heart
[59:53] God the things then he will
[59:56] do he will do I'm looking for another
[59:59] word he will do now now hallelujah amen
[1:00:04] so if that is our expectation then how
[1:00:07] must we be whenever we know that that
[1:00:10] this is a day for us to get deep into
[1:00:12] these things again you can't wait you
[1:00:16] are running to come in the fellowship
[1:00:17] you know yes you not be one of those
[1:00:19] people saying ah every day every almost
[1:00:21] every day we what is this kind of thing
[1:00:25] you will be into it if you are not
[1:00:26] interested please don't come okay only
[1:00:29] those who are interested then we shall
[1:00:32] enjoy this amen amen all right so having
[1:00:35] said that can we now please get into
[1:00:38] it now for the sake of our brothers who
[1:00:41] have joined us today i' would like to
[1:00:43] have one person here preferably you
[1:00:45] brother to explain to the people to them
[1:00:49] what we have done covered from the
[1:00:52] Ephesian from the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:54] Christ from the beginning of the book
[1:00:57] and the second chapter then now the
[1:00:59] third chapter give a brief summary on
[1:01:02] what we have covered so far for them to
[1:01:04] be able to understand what this book is
[1:01:06] all about and when we talk about this
[1:01:08] book is it a second Bible please explain
[1:01:10] to them why we are studying this book
[1:01:12] all right I think I'll give it to you
[1:01:14] brother for at least 10
[1:01:17] minutes I know I did not ask you to
[1:01:19] prepare for that but I know you were
[1:01:21] here when we were studying and I know
[1:01:22] you also know so please take your time
[1:01:25] and explain but do not be over 10
[1:01:28] minutes I hope you have a time there I
[1:01:30] mean a phone or something where you can
[1:01:32] see
[1:01:37] time no 10 minutes
[1:01:40] exactly
[1:01:43] Andover yeah I'm
[1:01:47] requ okay that sounds good you're
[1:01:53] welcome we soy to
[1:01:57] here
[1:02:01] brother so he got studying this book
[1:02:05] found
[1:02:06] us when we Onan
[1:02:10] church we just
[1:02:12] started
[1:02:15] last
[1:02:17] so we started this
[1:02:20] book from the the revelation of Jesus
[1:02:23] Christ
[1:02:26] as you can see an
[1:02:30] exposition is
[1:02:53] not talks of how God deals with
[1:02:56] us spiritual
[1:02:59] Israelites so he deals with us very
[1:03:03] higher
[1:03:04] form yes so is by this
[1:03:09] book is written by our Prophet The
[1:03:14] Prophet for
[1:03:16] day prophet he
[1:03:18] is the doesn't
[1:03:22] thees Voice doesn't die
[1:03:26] stilles
[1:03:31] when why why I can say that the word
[1:03:35] lives because the word
[1:03:38] is and the says
[1:03:43] yest so this
[1:03:45] book talks of the church
[1:03:48] ages means as
[1:03:53] we
[1:03:55] there are not different
[1:03:57] churches but it tells us of how God was
[1:04:00] revealing himself the same
[1:04:11] way let me say something brief to the
[1:04:14] revelation of Jesus
[1:04:17] Christ I think all of us we have our
[1:04:22] books the revelation of Jesus
[1:04:25] Christ we shared something small
[1:04:30] this
[1:04:40] some you may
[1:04:53] Wonder
[1:04:59] rudis when I
[1:05:09] reing us to the
[1:05:12] book
[1:05:15] because
[1:05:16] Revelation remember it was it's a book
[1:05:20] that Jesus himself
[1:05:23] wrote
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:26] was taken to the island
[1:05:29] ofos then him book
[1:05:34] ofation of all books the it's entirely
[1:05:37] written
[1:05:39] by
[1:05:48] so so we studed from this Revelation why
[1:05:53] the devil take Genesis and Revelation
[1:05:56] these two
[1:05:57] books and Sh a few
[1:06:01] things that the devil hates Genesis
[1:06:04] because Genesis talks of how reveals the
[1:06:09] plans of the
[1:06:11] devil
[1:06:14] Satan reveals the trigs reveals how kind
[1:06:23] is
[1:06:26] really say this and
[1:06:28] that
[1:06:34] so Genesis and then
[1:06:38] Revelation Revelation tells us of things
[1:06:42] that will happen
[1:06:44] to Revelation it's revealed to us how
[1:06:49] the end of the devil
[1:06:51] be so
[1:06:53] there The Book of Revelation
[1:06:57] why I believe if I canuse this sat knows
[1:07:01] the end how the end will be for him and
[1:07:06] his
[1:07:07] kingdom and those who worship
[1:07:10] him him are those who take what brings
[1:07:14] to them the mind the mind you accept
[1:07:22] it
[1:07:27] then we moved
[1:07:37] to
[1:07:40] Ang came
[1:07:44] to when he was in Exel I can ex because
[1:07:48] they taken him
[1:07:50] there to torture him but that was an
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:58] advantage why
[1:08:01] I when he was
[1:08:06] there knew that that was the only
[1:08:11] place to me was like an
[1:08:15] isolation we also learned that as was
[1:08:20] isolated each and every person has to be
[1:08:23] isol
[1:08:24] you have to isolate from other friends
[1:08:27] other things for you to
[1:08:30] chist just John was taken away no when
[1:08:35] they took him they thought they going to
[1:08:37] T him not knowing on the other hand some
[1:08:42] perfect was to
[1:08:43] be so when he was there him but it was
[1:08:48] for the good of you and
[1:08:51] me there are so many things learn from
[1:08:55] this I believe from
[1:08:59] this I believe I will share with
[1:09:12] you Vision we also went
[1:09:17] through uh I can say kinds of
[1:09:22] conduct think that we saw how things
[1:09:26] should be done if you have an expected
[1:09:29] end of something like for
[1:09:32] instance if you want to get
[1:09:36] football must be in the of playing
[1:09:40] football to
[1:09:44] get
[1:09:46] today Crown at
[1:09:49] last certain things you must for go
[1:09:55] for you to have that
[1:09:58] expect you know that he knows the plans
[1:10:03] he has for
[1:10:04] usam us but give
[1:10:08] used there are
[1:10:10] for these spirit I I can call them
[1:10:14] Spirits because God is spirit
[1:10:19] and
[1:10:21] do think
[1:10:24] he is a spirit himself and therefore we
[1:10:27] saw
[1:10:28] that in whatever you do find
[1:10:33] out what spirit is
[1:10:36] driving or else before you follow
[1:10:39] someone
[1:10:41] something thise let me use you have a
[1:10:45] friend I know Solon is my friend I
[1:10:50] should be knowing what brother Solon
[1:11:01] is so you cannot go like play football
[1:11:05] or I have a
[1:11:08] f i don't
[1:11:14] know don't
[1:11:17] know so before you
[1:11:21] follow first be what
[1:11:33] who
[1:11:39] exactly so where you be yeah then we
[1:11:46] also we went
[1:11:50] through the
[1:11:52] sa we learn
[1:11:54] what
[1:12:07] is US Sab is a
[1:12:11] day a Sunday
[1:12:13] ISB well that was then if I can put it
[1:12:18] but even if it was
[1:12:20] then we realize that those people at
[1:12:24] that
[1:12:25] time when we talk about the Old
[1:12:27] Testament about the
[1:12:30] isra they failed to keep that day though
[1:12:34] it was
[1:12:35] their they failed to keep that day found
[1:12:39] that they could go into the and go out
[1:12:41] of
[1:12:42] the going into the we're talking about
[1:12:45] the time they going in for Fellowship so
[1:12:48] when they entered in for that Fellowship
[1:12:51] as we can say Sunday morning
[1:12:54] they enter in
[1:12:56] yes they were holy of course whener have
[1:13:00] to come holy just like the Pharisees the
[1:13:03] Sadducees and herodians were the at that
[1:13:07] time they walked with
[1:13:09] such so we also learned
[1:13:13] that
[1:13:15] when go into
[1:13:17] their they only kept it holy for one
[1:13:20] day after the Sabbath they go
[1:13:23] and forn and steal and K
[1:13:28] Mur that was how they
[1:13:31] to that is how they had their only one
[1:13:36] day a week but then after
[1:13:39] that we also came to learn that that was
[1:13:41] the shadow of the things to
[1:13:44] come of the things to come now that's
[1:13:47] now in the New Testament I'm not saying
[1:13:49] that we should
[1:13:51] only on the new part and leaving the
[1:13:55] part it's the Bible is for the education
[1:14:00] of the body the body of
[1:14:03] Christ and then we found out that this
[1:14:07] sabbath what are we
[1:14:10] required to do in
[1:14:12] theath how get
[1:14:16] theb then they say that the Sabbath was
[1:14:19] rest and day you rest from
[1:14:22] work today you rest from other things
[1:14:25] you just go to church come back home Sit
[1:14:29] Stay enjoy with
[1:14:31] friends found that yeah that's true rest
[1:14:36] and then here tells us of how we can get
[1:14:39] the
[1:14:41] rest
[1:14:43] BS says that come
[1:14:48] me and I give you
[1:14:50] rest Come As You Are that's true that's
[1:14:54] right come as you are but he didn't say
[1:14:57] come and stay as you
[1:14:59] are come as you are you know
[1:15:03] friends
[1:15:05] tell I'm like he said come I it's true
[1:15:10] come as you are come as you
[1:15:13] are he's accepting you to come to
[1:15:16] conference and then when you come you
[1:15:18] have terms and conditions he has his
[1:15:21] terms and conditions so so if you accept
[1:15:24] his terms and
[1:15:29] conditions in this
[1:15:31] very
[1:15:36] found we need to enter into the rest and
[1:15:40] remain in that
[1:15:43] rest and the rest the sabath rest I can
[1:15:48] is the baptism of
[1:15:52] the so that when you then have in
[1:15:56] you then you will find rest you rest
[1:16:01] from your activities forance if I can
[1:16:04] give you this example if now in the
[1:16:08] night you went for
[1:16:12] club dance dance dance physically I can
[1:16:15] say that you're not to start with you're
[1:16:19] dancing you're busy you're not resting
[1:16:22] but one at home
[1:16:26] then
[1:16:28] that as brother sister we see you all
[1:16:33] the
[1:16:34] time course I
[1:16:36] know
[1:16:38] busy quite busy so you rested and then
[1:16:42] we found that this is entering
[1:16:45] into by one Spirit bapti into that body
[1:16:50] and you be a member of that body it
[1:16:53] means you stay in him and him is the
[1:16:57] word it means you have to stay in the
[1:16:59] word and that's how you can beess
[1:17:03] distress means you seing from your works
[1:17:06] and we read the scriptures The Works of
[1:17:08] the flesh saw that you
[1:17:12] stealing all
[1:17:13] that doesn't mean that you rest from
[1:17:16] your daily work because he also said
[1:17:18] that I bless the
[1:17:20] hands the works of your hands and you
[1:17:23] told nead that don't you know I love to
[1:17:26] in Affairs of so it means
[1:17:29] that the works that was talking
[1:17:32] about the of
[1:17:35] theh
[1:17:42] stealing
[1:17:44] using
[1:17:46] Envy those were the works of of theh and
[1:17:51] then we saw that it was when you give
[1:17:54] now your life when you enter the you
[1:17:58] from and then takes
[1:18:01] lead he takes the will from your hands
[1:18:05] you stop doing and then he starts the
[1:18:11] work if you have got the rest how can
[1:18:15] you that you the rest take with the word
[1:18:19] the fruits of that Holy Spirit Well you
[1:18:22] canot
[1:18:30] like therefore we need to see by by the
[1:18:33] life that
[1:18:35] you the
[1:18:36] fruits when I Ste how would you
[1:18:40] react will it be so will electrons be so
[1:18:43] much
[1:18:44] excited if they excited then I can say
[1:18:49] that but if I step
[1:18:53] and you knew me as brother said brother
[1:18:56] sorry it's again telling me
[1:18:59] apologizing then I can go back and I
[1:19:04] take with the word when you know they

[1:19:12] beat that is the
[1:19:15] life
[1:19:16] to just
[1:19:20] for so that is how we can
[1:19:24] know that you're put in
[1:19:26] risk as I said we can share
[1:19:30] this with you
[1:19:33] person that's what I can

[1:26:15] study of what church age was what it
[1:26:18] means when it was and what message for
[1:26:21] that church and what God did then
[1:26:24] remember what God did then he will
[1:26:26] continue to do today and he will do also
[1:26:28] tomorrow because Jesus Christ is the
[1:26:30] same yesterday and today and oh you do
[1:26:35] not see that verse where is that verse

[1:26:54] paraphrased it says Jesus
[1:27:00] Christ yes Jesus Christ is the same
[1:27:04] yesterday and today and forever
[1:27:07] hallelujah amen so he does the same well
[1:27:10] he is the same and uh he he does the
[1:27:14] same All Through the Ages so now we see
[1:27:16] that Ephesians was the beginning of the
[1:27:19] Gentile Church age and we have we we had

[1:32:03] yes when when it came
[1:32:15] remember
[1:32:18] mhed
[1:32:20] speaking m
[1:32:29] H
[1:32:38] yes are you
[1:32:40] hearing are you hearing yes did they
[1:32:43] speak in
[1:32:45] ttimes did they
[1:32:48] interpret please did they speak in
[1:32:50] ttimes yes did they interpret why didn't
[1:32:54] they interpret so are you telling me
[1:32:56] it's okay to speak in tongues without
[1:33:03] interpretation God bless you can you C
[1:33:05] for this
[1:33:09] sister just went through that almost for
[1:33:11] one hour yes it is okay but not in in
[1:33:15] church it must
[1:33:17] be interpreted not silent brother
[1:33:20] brother please that
[1:33:23] doct someone is saying that we should be
[1:33:26] silent in the church who told you we
[1:33:28] should we should speak T in church amen
[1:33:31] can you say Amen to that amen we should
[1:33:33] speak Tong in church but they must be
[1:33:37] accompanied
[1:33:38] with
[1:33:40] interpretation if there is no
[1:33:42] interpretation it is a sound without
[1:33:44] meaning we see it all over these
[1:33:46] Pentecostal churches they just speak but
[1:33:48] without meaning and therefore it becomes
[1:33:51] useless
[1:33:52] and many of those tongues are not
[1:33:54] genuine
[1:33:55] tongues it is meant to show that they
[1:33:59] are in the spirit but when they really
[1:34:01] not in the spirit so if you are you
[1:34:04] never switch of that BL so if they are
[1:34:06] in the spirit they must always interpret
[1:34:09] those Tong all right then they spoken
[1:34:13] tongues and did not interpret because
[1:34:16] the tongues they were speaking
[1:34:20] were
[1:34:22] where yes what did you say
[1:34:24] brother there were Tes of men that could
[1:34:28] be heard by men who were there at the
[1:34:30] time hallelujah oh sister I forgotten

[1:34:37] speak it right now in your
[1:34:40] tongue say that

[1:34:55] right yes I think I
[1:34:58] tried now did you see when I speak that
[1:35:01] she'll understand but some of you will
[1:35:03] not or almost all of you will not maybe
[1:35:05] one person or two you understand if
[1:35:08] someone speaks your tongue you
[1:35:10] understand you don't need interpretation
[1:35:11] right so these people spoke in tongues
[1:35:14] of the people of the Ethiopians of the
[1:35:17] Egyptians of the libyans of the of the
[1:35:20] ugandans amen of the Kenyans you
[1:35:24] understand there was no need of

[1:53:53] what was p is the pattern is the
[1:53:57] standard oh can you help me and shout
[1:54:00] and say is the
[1:54:01] standard stand yes God has not changed
[1:54:06] that pattern what go Pentecost he has to
[1:54:09] keep on doing until the church
[1:54:13] ages God bless all of you all right
[1:54:16] continue
[1:54:18] brother yes hey wait this thing is going
[1:54:21] through the whole church ages by the way
[1:54:24] not only at the PC not only Even in our
[1:54:26] day all through so we can now be able to
[1:54:28] see all the church ages as they go as
[1:54:30] they as we progress we can be able to
[1:54:32] know that that was the messenger and
[1:54:35] that God used these people because we
[1:54:37] see the things that we on the P we see
[1:54:40] them in their
[1:54:41] Church H even today we can be able to
[1:54:44] say this is the True Church of God if we
[1:54:46] see the things we see on the day of
[1:54:48] pente are you following me so even if
[1:54:51] people believe in shouting dancing and
[1:54:53] talking T but if they don't believe in
[1:54:55] baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:54:57] Christ we know that is not the true
[1:54:58] church you see we cannot find the
[1:55:01] standard Hallelujah okay
[1:55:03] continue SCH oh wait a moment brother
[1:55:06] even if they can baptize in the name of
[1:55:08] our Lord Jesus Christ and there is no
[1:55:10] speaking in tongues and shouting and
[1:55:12] dancing and we can now say that is not
[1:55:15] the real Church oh you are feeling to
[1:55:17] say that we can now say that's not the
[1:55:19] true church
[1:55:20] because there must still be heal there
[1:55:22] must be speaking in t there must still
[1:55:24] be giving of the prise of God there must
[1:55:26] be all these signs Anders there must be
[1:55:28] the manifestation right if it a true
[1:55:30] church it should have both it should
[1:55:33] have both it should have now some people
[1:55:36] say that those are the pcal babies they
[1:55:38] do those things for us we
[1:55:40] don't say that the
[1:55:43] what the not only the pattern but it is
[1:55:47] also the standard it's the what stand
[1:55:50] amen all right brother go on reading
[1:55:53] schs may tell you the apostolic age is
[1:55:56] over don't you believe it such a
[1:55:58] statement is wrong when two CS first of
[1:56:01] all it is wrong to Suppose there aren't
[1:56:04] any more Apostles because
[1:56:07] original means please follow El I ask
[1:56:10] you to tell us what the was reading okay
[1:56:13] and there are many sent ones today but
[1:56:16] they are called missionaries as long as
[1:56:18] men are being called and with the word
[1:56:21] of Life there
[1:56:24] apol
[1:56:26] Hallelujah so in other words what does
[1:56:29] Apostle
[1:56:34] mean right an apost means aent one I
[1:56:39] feel sent me to go to people you are an
[1:56:42] apost or you have an Apostolic anointing
[1:56:46] right does God have apost today
[1:56:50] amen okay uhuh secondly secondly they
[1:56:53] refer to an age of manifested holy ghost
[1:56:56] power as been over since the Bible has
[1:57:00] been
[1:57:01] completed that is untrue that is
[1:57:03] what you
[1:57:05] foll they say they to age of meaning
[1:57:09] they meaning the scholars the
[1:57:12] theologians they they said that the age
[1:57:15] of
[1:57:15] manifestation of the Holy Ghost in power
[1:57:19] h ah that is over since the since the
[1:57:21] Bible has been completed it is
[1:57:24] over brother K is that over is God has
[1:57:29] God finished manifesting himself in
[1:57:31] power so we can still cast up demons now
[1:57:34] so we can still pray in t so we can
[1:57:36] still heal the sick so we can still
[1:57:38] dance in the spirit are you hearing this
[1:57:41] thing yes
[1:57:44] why oh because
[1:57:47] what because why come on now
[1:57:59] hallelujah amen sister are you following
[1:58:03] very well are you getting what we are
[1:58:06] saying I'm talking to you sister are you
[1:58:09] hearing are are you following very
[1:58:12] well amen amen I'm glad you're following
[1:58:15] all right uhhuh then continue brother
[1:58:18] continue brother
[1:58:23] mhm there is not even one scripture that
[1:58:26] suggests that but many conclusively
[1:58:30] state otherwise here is our proof that
[1:58:33] both of these charges are false acts 2:
[1:58:37] 38 39 then Peter said unto them repent
[1:58:41] and be baptized everyone of you in the
[1:58:43] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:58:45] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:58:47] of the Holy Ghost for for the promises
[1:58:50] unto you and to your children and to all
[1:58:53] that are far even as many as the Lord
[1:58:56] Our God
[1:58:57] shall the promise of Power with which
[1:59:01] the apostles were ended at p is to yous
[1:59:05] Hallelujah you and to your children the
[1:59:10] Jews and to all that are far the
[1:59:13] Gentiles and to as many as the Lord Our
[1:59:17] God shall call both Jew and gentil
[1:59:20] until he stops calling the pcal message
[1:59:23] and power will not
[1:59:25] hallelujah oh my people drunk right now
[1:59:29] that P what message first first first
[1:59:34] message and power will not until he
[1:59:39] stops calling has it stopped calling no
[1:59:41] so why do some people say even in this
[1:59:43] message that the
[1:59:45] PC those things you know you know those
[1:59:48] things for young in the faith young in
[1:59:51] the
[1:59:52] faith it has not ceased God is still
[1:59:55] manifesting himself in power God deliv
[1:59:58] even if you here and bound by some kind
[2:00:00] of
[2:00:02] demon I'm telling you you come for
[2:00:05] you if you know aing
[2:00:08] you you will beiver

[2:01:56] is is what is coming there
[2:01:59] one the pure word
[2:02:17] of
[2:02:36] the true word of God which does talk

[2:04:01] believe the True Church of God must have

[2:04:06] manifestation of the Holy Ghost in signs
[2:04:11] in wonders in gifts of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:15] what are

[2:18:51] one church that believe this message
[2:18:53] amen but generally speaking it will not
[2:18:57] be a very large group okay if you
[2:19:00] consider the Believers over who believe
[2:19:01] the truth in every generation been the
[2:19:04] minority okay so don't expect to be a
[2:19:07] very what chur a very big church it will
[2:19:10] be than despised it was oppressed it was

[2:21:07] and see the first and perfect ACT
[2:21:11] of by

[2:21:18] church will always try to be like the
[2:21:20] original at Pentecost the true church of

[2:27:44] H it's not planned

[2:27:52] us the we reading and not just reading
[2:27:56] reading information it is real amen it
[2:27:59] is real amen it's just the officer C who
[2:28:02] just told me theyeas is harmonized
[2:28:07] regarding Isaac now but now this issue
[2:28:10] we PR for was for the GS Isaac has been
[2:28:13] in prison he slept there even but God
[2:28:14] has given him Grace and I know he's
[2:28:17] going to be B now to preach even more
[2:28:18] now
[2:28:20] Hallelujah okay shall we now proceed and
[2:28:23] find a place where we can finish for
[2:28:26] today where were
[2:28:29] we okay can we
[2:28:32] read can one of us read from but what I
[2:28:35] said was that because of the unchanging
[2:28:37] I don't know which point you were
[2:28:39] explaining do you remember what you
[2:28:40] explaining can you finish up with
[2:28:45] that brother Isaac are you sleeping oh
[2:28:48] you're reading
[2:28:52] who okay I
[2:28:55] invite
[2:28:58] yeah that
[2:29:06] before now don't
[2:29:08] get when I say that God and his ways
[2:29:11] never change I did not say that the
[2:29:14] church and its Messengers could not
[2:29:15] change
[2:29:17] the church isn't good so she can change
[2:29:21] yeah so I was trying to explain
[2:29:24] something
[2:29:31] this can't change and then you know the
[2:29:35] church can change the church is talking
[2:29:39] here
[2:29:40] like the days of the voice the days of
[2:29:43] the voice change yes because
[2:29:47] has uh three kinds of Believers yeah non
[2:29:51] believers Believers and True
[2:29:54] Believers those ones without faith those
[2:29:57] ones with little faith NE ones and then
[2:30:00] those genu ones with real faith those
[2:30:02] are True
[2:30:04] Believers you find that the ones who
[2:30:07] will not change are going to be
[2:30:11] like let me say something about that how
[2:30:14] will they be like because God is the
[2:30:19] word
[2:30:21] so they will take this word and it will
[2:30:25] be manifest in their lives they will
[2:30:27] take it believe it taking meaning
[2:30:30] believeing the one accepting it their
[2:30:32] hearts in the same
[2:30:34] church then that word will be manifested
[2:30:38] in their lives amen and then they will
[2:30:40] be one with Christ so that will be the
[2:30:43] person who change in that church m
[2:30:46] because we aware that that will be the
[2:30:47] wife the wife will be the word God is
[2:30:50] the word and the wife will have to be
[2:30:53] the word that's the and then here it
[2:30:56] says that God does not change and then
[2:31:00] before you leave that point people may
[2:31:01] be confused God is the word and the
[2:31:04] church is the
[2:31:06] wife what does that mean how can
[2:31:15] we you know the the bride or the wife it
[2:31:19] means that the word is God and God is
[2:31:22] the husband of the
[2:31:26] church and we are his wife we are his
[2:31:31] bride white or
[2:31:34] bright Revelation 197 what does it
[2:31:38] say is a very common verse you can Sur
[2:31:42] without reading
[2:31:45] it yes say it
[2:31:48] loudly the
[2:31:51] bride ready yeah but how does it begin
[2:31:55] let
[2:31:56] us and
[2:31:59] rejoice and give H to
[2:32:15] him
[2:32:19] the church is the wife and him the
[2:32:21] husband of the church hallelujah amen
[2:32:26] okay in the interest of time shall we
[2:32:28] now continue from there and we take it
[2:32:31] from
[2:32:32] after explained the true church will
[2:32:35] always try to be like the original
[2:32:38] atart are youw I am
[2:32:41] reading yes the true church will always
[2:32:44] try to be like the original at Pentecost
[2:32:46] yes the true church of today will try to
[2:32:48] approximate that first that first
[2:32:51] one and the messengers of the churches
[2:32:53] having the same spirit of God in them
[2:32:55] will try to approximate the Apostle Paul
[2:32:57] yes they won't be exactly like him but
[2:33:00] the true Messengers will be the ones
[2:33:03] that come to the closest to Paul who was
[2:33:07] free of all men sold out to God and gave
[2:33:11] forth the word of God only he was free
[2:33:13] of all men meaning no man controlled him
[2:33:16] Hallelujah even in me I believe No One
[2:33:19] controls me every preacher no one should
[2:33:21] control you even the pastors you know
[2:33:24] don't say don't believe in the pastors
[2:33:26] and how the church you know yeah we
[2:33:27] believe in the pastors but the pastors
[2:33:29] do not control people by their own ideas
[2:33:31] Pastor control people by two things one
[2:33:34] the word two the Holy Spirit you see you
[2:33:38] by the Holy Spirit can lead people or
[2:33:40] you by the word can lead people but you
[2:33:42] do not lead them by your own ideas or by
[2:33:45] your own thoughts
[2:33:46] so Paul was free of all men sold out to
[2:33:50] God and gave forth the word of God only
[2:33:52] and manifested the what the Holy Ghost
[2:33:55] in power in power none else would would
[2:33:59] do none else would do you have to work
[2:34:02] from the original as like begins like
[2:34:05] the true church will always be the one
[2:34:07] that tries to follow in the steps of our
[2:34:09] Founders at pente and our Messengers
[2:34:11] will follow the Apostle Paul the first
[2:34:13] messenger the first church age it is it

[2:35:24] simple yet so wonderful I was able by
[2:35:28] the help of the Holy Spirit to read the
[2:35:31] book of Revelation and the histories and
[2:35:34] find there in each age each
[2:35:37] messenger
[2:35:40] the
[2:35:41] each and the
[2:35:43] part to the
[2:35:46] of those
[2:35:49] ages

[2:35:59] can hear me can you explain to us
[2:36:01] exactly because now just says with this
[2:36:05] key okay he explains with this key but
[2:36:09] we do not know well of course we have
[2:36:10] already G through but someone may not
[2:36:12] even have understood what is the key
[2:36:14] that used to come
[2:36:17] to uh to come to
[2:36:20] this to determine
[2:36:24] the uh the church age messenger each
[2:36:28] messenger of each Church age to
[2:36:29] determine the direction of each age to
[2:36:33] determine all these
[2:36:36] things what the key that he use brother
[2:36:39] if you would like to take it up from
[2:36:40] there and explain a little bit for the
[2:36:42] for the people here as
[2:36:44] well

[2:37:10] in in a position to answer the
[2:37:13] question okay do you have
[2:37:17] yes I have it right at hand but I was
[2:37:20] somewhere I was not really in the
[2:37:22] point when we were reading okay yes okay
[2:37:26] but have have you been following so
[2:37:29] far yes from the previous paragraph I
[2:37:33] was there following
[2:37:34] up and then I was
[2:37:39] just maybe the Holy Spirit wants to you
[2:37:41] to get something that you missed and
[2:37:43] then there that's why he called you
[2:37:46] so can we have someone brother brother
[2:37:48] Isaac you would like to do that okay who
[2:37:50] would like to explain to
[2:37:51] brother the uses
[2:37:54] here who ready you
[2:37:57] brother you no don't don't fear whatever
[2:38:02] there's no wrong answer here okay you
[2:38:06] have an idea about it okay can you
[2:38:07] please put brother uh the brother on the
[2:38:11] screen okay we shall have a brother here
[2:38:13] and he will be able to take it up
[2:38:24] okay might want to use a bit bigger
[2:38:27] voice
[2:38:40] explain
[2:38:44] how
[2:38:46] say
[2:38:49] PA say
[2:38:53] that was not in authority of any man was
[2:38:58] led by the spirit and by the word yes so
[2:39:01] he said that to get other other other
[2:39:05] Messengers every age he used to study BS
[2:39:14] hisory yes sh and then he used used to
[2:39:18] identify those ones who are
[2:39:21] close how PA was how the signs and W
[2:39:28] that those signs and wonders he
[2:39:34] used yes and that's how he was able
[2:39:38] toidentify
[2:39:40] the Revelation in each in each
[2:39:44] Church identify the situation during
[2:39:48] that
[2:39:48] time idy
[2:39:55] that so but there is a key a specific
[2:39:58] key that he uses the key was that the
[2:40:01] standard was God Bless you that's what I
[2:40:04] was looking for stand at we have already
[2:40:08] gone through for almost 1 hour more than
[2:40:10] one hour that was the standard that's
[2:40:12] was the key go ahead stand the of the
[2:40:16] world yes and then the
[2:40:20] Manifest
[2:40:22] yes yes amen God bless all of you
[2:40:26] Hallelujah so we see that what happens
[2:40:29] at
[2:40:30] Pentecost the purity of the word the
[2:40:33] signs and wonders the manifestation of
[2:40:36] the Holy Ghost and the true Messengers
[2:40:39] were right in there believing that
[2:40:42] manifesting that and so that's the key
[2:40:45] that goes
[2:40:47] throughout the church ages so we are
[2:40:50] able to know which age we are living in
[2:40:52] the message of that age what church It
[2:40:54] Is by seeing what God did at Pentecost
[2:40:57] are they close to what was at
[2:41:00] Pentecost even we able to know the
[2:41:02] church I am in is it true or not trying
[2:41:04] to B on is it doing what was done at
[2:41:07] Pentecost are you following yes that is
[2:41:09] the key that we use that is how we able
[2:41:12] to know yes the the True Church of Jesus
[2:41:15] Christ and we able to track it from the
[2:41:17] beginning until today are you
[2:41:20] understanding amen so right now let us I
[2:41:24] I wanted to push it until to some point
[2:41:26] but um I do not know let us
[2:41:30] see okay uh let's let's do a few more
[2:41:35] minutes since you now understand how we
[2:41:38] judge what the true church was like what
[2:41:41] she was at Pentecost and what she was in
[2:41:44] the apostolic age
[2:41:46] as set forth in the word in the book of
[2:41:48] Acts we can now apply the same rule to
[2:41:51] show us how the church failed the basic
[2:41:54] error or errors that creped into the
[2:41:57] first church and were revealed in the
[2:42:00] book of Acts and Revelation and also in
[2:42:02] the Epistles will become more and more
[2:42:04] visibly manifested in each subsequent
[2:42:07] age until we come to a complete black
[2:42:09] out of Truth in the last age which is
[2:42:12] the age now can I have a sister read
[2:42:15] from that next
[2:42:17] paragraph all right quickly assister
[2:42:20] that
[2:42:29] will okay yeah that's you try to make
[2:42:32] your voice a bit louder for people to be
[2:42:35] able to hear you
[2:42:40] now comes another slight wonderful truth
[2:42:45] say that the true church always try to
[2:42:49] like it in the book
[2:42:51] ofs that is
[2:42:53] exactly but we we have discovered that
[2:42:57] the word also
[2:42:59] tees eror
[2:43:02] is
[2:43:06] truth yes the question arises in our
[2:43:10] minds does God forsake his own and let
[2:43:14] them fall into state of
[2:43:16] complete deception does he does he no
[2:43:23] sister for says very clearly in Matthew
[2:43:30] 24 canot be
[2:43:33] deed for there shall rise false christs
[2:43:38] and false prophets and shall two
[2:43:41] great and wonders in so much that it
[2:43:45] possible shall receive
[2:43:51] very
[2:43:53] Hallelujah now can the El be deceived
[2:43:56] this another Point can just skip can the
[2:44:00] be deceived did you know that people are
[2:44:02] preaching this that even the El will be
[2:44:04] deceived by the false
[2:44:07] Christ the
[2:44:10] El
[2:44:13] deceived because
[2:44:15] whates the scure say
[2:44:21] m44
[2:44:24] for Matthew
[2:44:29] 24:24 loud
[2:44:39] loud that it possible they shall deceive
[2:44:44] the very
[2:44:45] can that
[2:44:48] if so is
[2:44:51] it Hallelujah so the word if
[2:44:55] there it shows you the impossibility of
[2:44:59] it the the false
[2:45:02] Christ by the way when he say false
[2:45:04] Christ does mean false
[2:45:07] Jesus is only meaning
[2:45:10] false
[2:45:11] anointed what does the word Christ mean
[2:45:14] the anointed
[2:45:16] the anointed one so we not talking about
[2:45:19] the man Jesus we're talking about many
[2:45:21] people coming in the name of I'm
[2:45:24] anointed I can touch you and you can
[2:45:26] fall down I can do this I can shout and
[2:45:28] then something happens I can blow on
[2:45:30] you the man does like
[2:45:33] this on you you
[2:45:37] fall you know it's an anointing right
[2:45:40] yes but the anointing is not wrong but
[2:45:43] the man is
[2:45:45] wrong ration Reve To Us by the message
[2:45:49] the anointing is not wrong but the man
[2:45:52] himself is wrong so he is false but he
[2:45:57] is Anointed so they are false anointed
[2:46:04] one take to H because of them being
[2:46:09] false they don't have the word but they
[2:46:12] can only manifest the anointing so
[2:46:14] that's why the B talks about those false
[2:46:16] and the false
[2:46:17] prophets they will show Great
[2:46:20] Signs they will
[2:46:23] show way
[2:46:32] so Miracles but when they false
[2:46:35] prophets and wonders so if it were
[2:46:39] possible why would it be almost possible
[2:46:41] to deceive the because these Miracles
[2:46:44] will be real
[2:46:46] whereby the will see and say this is the
[2:46:48] way I see the true church of
[2:46:51] Pentecost and if it is by the grace of
[2:46:53] God they also can be deceived but we God
[2:46:56] they can be deceived A Hallelujah am
[2:47:00] that's the only thing that comforts me
[2:47:01] to know that I can never be deceived I
[2:47:04] can never be deceived
[2:47:07] hallelujah oh Hallelujah people in our
[2:47:11] generation are running after miracles
[2:47:13] signs and wonders but the Bride of Jesus
[2:47:15] Christ is running
[2:47:17] after is running
[2:47:23] after God bless you amen the true church
[2:47:26] is rning after the pure word of God that
[2:47:31] is what we are running after the can

[2:49:53] those on who are who are following
[2:49:54] Miracles they are not Believers those
[2:49:58] who believe the Miracles the signs the
[2:50:00] word they shall follow Hallelujah we the
[2:50:05] word we live a life of of of Christ

[2:50:15] understand because we are believer right
[2:50:19] and then and then someone asks me here a
[2:50:21] question sister please does God forsake
[2:50:23] his own and let them fall into a state
[2:50:26] of complete deception the answer is no

[2:54:24] will never accept it even if you bring
[2:54:27] Angel Mich himself to preach they will
[2:54:29] never evenus himself comes from heaven

[2:55:48] having a book so if you have your book I
[2:55:49] would like you to read if you don't then
[2:55:53] I can have sister P right here sister P
[2:55:57] if your network is stable to the exent
[2:55:59] that you can read for us I'm happy if
[2:56:01] you can read that remaining part for
[2:56:05] us okay let's check our sister
[2:56:12] piece okay can you start
[2:56:21] video okay somehow I can't see this
[2:56:24] video and I can't hear her but she tried
[2:56:27] to unmute can you hear
[2:56:34] me okay your video is
[2:56:43] off
[2:56:46] okay can you read can you read even if
[2:56:48] your video is
[2:56:58] off what paragraph are we going
[2:57:08] to
[2:57:09] what oh really it says what then the
[2:57:14] answer is Cle before us do you have that
[2:57:16] before you can you
[2:57:29] read is that clear for you no no that's
[2:57:34] we can hear but not very very
[2:57:39] [Music]
[2:57:43] clear
[2:58:12] is
[2:58:21] Hallelujah this is how it has been this
[2:58:24] is how it is now and this is how it will
[2:58:26] be the false Vine tries to kill the True
[2:58:30] Vine claiming that they are wrong here
[2:58:32] in Uganda we had a man who killed he was
[2:58:35] Roman Catholic and then he converted to
[2:58:37] being something he was say
[2:58:38] that his name is and he killed very many
[2:58:42] people by burning them so since that
[2:58:45] time whenever you are small small and
[2:58:48] you preaching the truth they call you
[2:58:50] they these are the because they don't
[2:58:51] have big churches like them because for
[2:58:53] them they have big churches they can be
[2:58:55] seen on a mountain and everything they
[2:58:57] say oh we the right ones and these small
[2:58:59] small ones are the wrong ones who told
[2:59:01] you the right ones have always been the
[2:59:03] small small ones and the big ones have
[2:59:05] always been the wrong ones if you search
[2:59:07] your Bible the Bible says the way that
[2:59:09] goes to heaven is
[2:59:10] what
[2:59:12] and narrow and
[2:59:17] straight is the way that leads
[2:59:20] to come
[2:59:23] on know
[2:59:25] your and he says There Will Be Few that
[2:59:29] will find it few that
[2:59:33] will few that will find it very few that
[2:59:37] will find it but the to H
[2:59:41] is and many shall find
[2:59:44] so which way do you want to
[2:59:47] go I'm going to close it here but I want
[2:59:51] to give you a small story or testimony
[2:59:54] as I close one day I was in Ethiopia and
[2:59:57] we were driving I was the one driving
[3:00:00] and
[3:00:02] uh I reached a place we are going to a
[3:00:06] tall you know tall station and I was
[3:00:09] with a brother so I I told him which
[3:00:11] lane should I take you know there are
[3:00:12] many lanes like four LAN three so he
[3:00:15] said you should take this one which has
[3:00:16] many people I was like many cars I was
[3:00:20] like but this one has many cars which
[3:00:23] means it might be Str in front that was
[3:00:25] my reasoning and his reasoning was like
[3:00:28] no because many car it means the one
[3:00:30] which is right the one this which has no
[3:00:34] you should not take it I like okay let
[3:00:36] us go so I took the with the one of many
[3:00:40] CS so we went slowly slow so when we
[3:00:42] reach in front
[3:00:44] we realize the other L which had no car
[3:00:48] was free but everyone was taking the one
[3:00:52] with many think is good and they were
[3:00:55] all close close to one another by the
[3:00:57] time you got you escape so we were all
[3:01:00] going blindly because others were going
[3:01:02] in the same L you
[3:01:04] realize that is how the world is
[3:01:12] where not never do that amen follow or
[3:01:16] go a certain direction take a certain
[3:01:18] way simply because you are convinced in
[3:01:20] your heart is the right way amen pray
[3:01:23] about it if it is the wrong way God will
[3:01:26] correct you God will say to that you
[3:01:28] don't go to him but whatever you take be
[3:01:32] convinced in your heart it is the truth
[3:01:34] I believe this message because I am
[3:01:36] convinced fully it is the truth if at
[3:01:39] any time there is more truth that comes
[3:01:42] the Holy Spirit Will make sure he direct
[3:01:44] me to it but for now he directed me to
[3:01:48] this truth and I'm so glad that he found

[3:11:08] and he was very I told him I pray the
[3:11:10] Living God will reveal to reveal to you

[3:11:15] saying then when I said that he told me
[3:11:18] I had some change happening in his soul
[3:11:20] immediately and then he started saying
[3:11:22] oh actually you're the one who's right
[3:11:25] the scriptures are okay then all of the
[3:11:27] sudden the Holy Spirit came down and
