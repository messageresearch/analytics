Not because of ourselves but because of you in us, Christ in us. the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to commit this service in your house. Lord, many who are here and others coming in. Lord, perhaps even those connected with us online, some from very far. Lord, we remember Sister Dina Father. Lord, on the other side of the continent, many others, Lord, that might be connected to this service. Oh God, I pray that you will come down through the revelation of your word as we sit Lord on your table. We pray that you will feed us. &gt;&gt; We pray that Lord the spirit of Jesus Christ will be evident Lord in this service by the power of your word. Lord, may you hold us close by the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We give you this service now. &gt;&gt; We ask that you you will be the preeminent one. May we the speakers step aside and may you possess these vessels, Lord. And Lord, may may we not get in the way of the spirit, but may you just come and overtake us, Lord. Speak to us. Overtake every listener. Let everything around them Lord fed away. And may you, Lord, minister your word of life to each heart. in Jesus mighty name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Amen. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? Shall we turn to Colossians chapter 2? [Music] Thank you musicians. God bless you so much. Uh we are reading uh Colossians chapter 2 8 to 12. So this is I'm speaking on God having preeminence in his body or in his bride. Amen. And we want you to look at verses uh we can begin from verses 64 for you to get a So walk ye in him, rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware, lest any man spoiled you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudments of the world, and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily, and ye are complete, in him, which is the head of all principality and power, in whom also ye are circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye arisen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. forch. [Music] [Music] Amen. God bless you. May be seated, please. If you you turn a page and look at chapter 1 um vers 22. &gt;&gt; Really I think everyone should have their Bible and and you know you should also always get a pen so whereby you can underline some of these verses and write some inspiration. So I want you to look at verses 22 of chapter one. He says, okay, we'll begin from 23. If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was pre uh preached to every creature, which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul, are made a minister, Yes, just just follow this verse 24. says, "Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church. whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God. [Music] And then I'm going to read this together. &gt;&gt; Um, from 26 all the way to 29. Listen. Even the mystery which has been heed from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus, where unto I also labor, striving to his working, which workketh in me mighty. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Read verses 26 to 29. Crystal [Music] Moonche. Amen. Ask your neighbor, are you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; All right. I believe everybody said they're ready. So, see uh uh if you notice how Apostle Paul writes to the Colossians, he is mainly uh dealing with the preeminence of of Christ in his church. like like he's trying to present himself as a a servant. &gt;&gt; Yes. He says, "I I was made a minister. I made a minister." And and then he shows it, but it has nothing to do with him, but it has everything to do with Christ. And then he says that Christ is the fullness of the of of the godhead bodly. And then you know he begins to talk about the mystery of God. And he says you see this mystery has been hidden or hid from ages and from generations but now he's saying now to his saints it has been made manifest. to the saints. He will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery. And he says this mystery is Christ in you. Tell your neighbor Christ in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all about Christ, friends. It's all about Christ. So when we talk about you, we're not talking about you. We're talking about Christ in you. You know Christ is God. Christ is the fullness of Godhead. But even Jesus said that without him I am nothing. So how about you? Without him what are you? So without him we are nothing. Praise the name of the Lord. And Apostle Paul is very careful here as he's writing to the Colossians to tell him we are preaching our preaching is all about Christ. He says whom we preach. You see, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. So our perfection is not in us. Our perfection is in Christ. So the only way we can be made perfect is if we are in Christ. And then you know he continues on on chapter two to warn and to say therefore let let's um beware be careful. He says, "Watch that let any lest any man spoil you through philosophy, &gt;&gt; through uh vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, [Music] and not after Christ." There's another portion where he says that Satan himself made himself the angel of light and he has made his ministers ministers of righteousness. So today we have preachers who are hired by Satan. &gt;&gt; Can you can you believe it? &gt;&gt; Who are hired by Satan. who are preaching on behalf of Satan, but they are actually leading people to hell. And the only way you can be able to know is by what Paul is saying in Colossians 2:8. He says, "Beware, lest any man spoil you." Now, now in another place it says, "These are men who crept among us. They crept in unawares." And so, and then they they have become preachers of righteousness. But what are they preaching? What are they doing with the ministry? How you know them is that they do not point you to Christ. They do not lead the church to Christ, but they lead you to themselves and their leader, Satan. How? Through philosophy, through vain deceit, through tradition of men and good men of the world. But every God orained man, every God called man will lead you to Christ, will preach you to Christ, will introduce you to Christ. Amen. That was the purpose of him taking the book. Praise the name of the Lord. There is a difference of opening the book and revealing the book. Are you following me, child? So, there's only one that was worthy to take the book and to open it, to lose the seal. There was no man that was worthy. There was no angel that was worthy. There was no one but Christ. He alone is one and we sing this in many songs. He alone is one to receive glory and honor and adoration forever and ever. Amen. No one else who can stand against. No one can, no one will. And he alone is worthy. There's no prophet that was worthy. But you see the prophet comes later as the revealer of the mysteries that are already open. So some people thought that brother Bam opened. Well that makes him Christ. That makes him our redeemer. But he is not like Apostle Paul. His work was to introduce you and lead you to Christ. So this message is not brother Brham Brother. I expected an amen there. This message is not our church. &gt;&gt; Is not any denomination. This message is Christ. Actually, brother himself says the message is Christ. That's what it's all about. And anything done, anything said that is not about Christ, then we are being misled. [Music] So he gives us those things. He says philosophy. This man will spoil you through philosophy. Philosophy. What is philosophy? Philosophy. Philosophy is credle. &gt;&gt; In Latin it is called credored or creed. [Music] set of beliefs, thinking, &gt;&gt; ideas, understandings, you know that a man will have but it is not Christ and that's why we have many denominations because all the denominations have their philophies on God. Every religion has their own philosophy. They have their own creeds. They have their own thinking, ideologies, beliefs, set of ideas. But this message, we do not have any creed. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have a church manual. That is why we don't have a church menu. We are not going to get a church menu because our creed is Christ. No creed but Christ. No membership but fellowship. No law but love. Are you following me now? But you see these men will spoil you through their creeds and they will hire teachers, &gt;&gt; preachers, disciples, but they will teach. They will cultivate. [Music] They will cultivate in them that these people may be able to dis to to to like disseminate it. No, you didn't get it. These systems, &gt;&gt; what we what we are dealing with here is one of the major things. And so I want you to quickly get in the spirit. Brother, &gt;&gt; listen. These systems &gt;&gt; what they do &gt;&gt; they they they cultivate these people disciples they get their own disciples. All right. And after they disciple them. You know what they do? They cultivate them. There is a better word for cultivation. They cultivate them to become diards of their system of their idea whereby these will be the main disciples, their system. Then now they send them out and go and disseminate what they have cultivated them to see it clearly. You'll understand it by what you you saw the uh the today we have some systems that do that. Every denomination does but the ones who have done it so well had the Roman Catholic you cannot get married we will take care of you we do everything for you come we cultivate you when we put our system in you then now you go out and disseminate for life. No matter what you do, these men can die for their ideas. They can die for their cre they will be spies and you never know. In one of our churches here, there was a church. One infiltrated even we did not know who he was. He came in as a as someone who has received the message and and we supported him with funds and everything all over the world. A reverend father has been living and he was in in in the message trying the message operates. So they want to understand because they don't we don't have any system of we don't have a headquarter you know if there if if it is hard there is one thing that is hard is to destroy an unorganized movement if something is organized you destroy from the top and it will just be But when it is not organized, there is no headquarter. There is no headman you know. But the truth is everywhere. So they are having a headache. They can't understand who we are, what we are standing for, how they can destroy us. So they they begin to send in spies. And this man came in Many of you know who I'm talking about. He came in for months and months. He he tried to, you know, come in and clean everywhere. Get to know everybody. Get to know how the chain moves. And by the time they found out who he was, oh my goodness, the damage he had caused, the damage he had caused, the the the the girls he had raped. The girls he had fornicated he had destroyed supposed to be a priest. What am I talking about? By the time he left, he confessed that he actually knows the message isn't truth. And we are able to know who he was because he confessed. But he must have realized he cannot destroy the message. No one can destroy the message. If you destroy me, you don't know what you're doing. The millions like me and they are not even connected with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can't destroy us all. &gt;&gt; You see something we saw was the false vine cannot destroy the true vine. They cannot destroy us because we are not standing for any creed. We do not have any church manual. We are not an organization but we our creed is Christ and to destroy us how to destroy Christ. But you cannot destroy Christ. He is the center of our faith. He is the center of our being. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why the devil knows that he knows he can destroy a group. &gt;&gt; So you will try to come and destroy individuals come to you, come to the other. Come to the other and try to silence the voices that are standing for the word. Try to bring perversion. into false doctrine. &gt;&gt; And then when one man who was standing for the word goes into false doctrine, the devil thinks have finished them but he doesn't understand. He cannot finish us. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. When one of us go into the first story, the church moves on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it tries to strike them with sin and tries to silence those. &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, friends, the church of Christ has a prophecy on its head and the prophecy is the hell over it. Hallelujah. So you see these men. They come to spoil the church. How do they come? They come with philosophy, &gt;&gt; with a set of creeds, &gt;&gt; with church manuals. Amen. I'm so glad we don't have a church manual. We will never have a church. We cannot have a church. Our church manual is the revival. He will come with vain deceit. He will come with tradition of men. Instead of teaching the word people will be glued to tradition. And I talked about that so much on Sunday with the rudiments of the world for Christ. I want you to know wants to have preeminence in his church. And for him to have preeminence in his church. Amen. He will do that by the word and the spirit. The word and the spirit. The word and the spirit are one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Follow me closely. If someone claims to believe the word, but then they reject the Holy Spirit, it shows they did not believe to begin. Yes. Can you say amen to that? If someone claims to have the spirit, but then they they they reject the word, it shows they never received the word. They never received the spirit to begin with. Someone has the Holy Ghost. Amen. They will always receive the word. I don't care their denomination. I don't care their religion. And be baptized in the water. They will always receive the word. anything short of this it only creates philosophy vendit tradition follow me closely philosophy tradition of men these things are the breeding grounds for cults Okay. So, I want us to deal with something today. I have a question for you. What is a cult? A cult can refer to a group with an unusual or often extreme religious, spiritual or philosophical belief system. They are often with a charismatic leader who exerts significant control over the members. Alternatively, it can also signify intense devotion to a person. You devote your life to a man, okay? Or to an idea or to a lifestyle. The term carries negative conotations in popular uses, often implying questionable activities or unconventional practices. So you'll find these people who are actually in a cult okay they will always they will I don't know if you find a better word for cult you always find in a cult that people are very religious they are very spiritual [Applause] extreme philosophical. But behind all that there is a man and you will find that if they will say if our man has not said it if it is true if it is false we will not be. So they are not interested in the truth but they are interested in what their man has said. Their alleiance is with a man with a system and not Christ not the word. Hallelujah. Now you know what is Oh, we see that everywhere. It doesn't matter. By the way, it doesn't matter what they believe. They may even be claiming to believe the message and they are a how but if they put all their allegiance they put it to a man they put it to their church to their system and not after If you want to know who they are, talk against their man. They can even hit you physically because their allegiance is with a man. That's how killed those people. They were in a cultivated them. A cult is a place where people are cultivated to believe in a man, a system or an idea. Are you following me now? Such they believed in him. They did not have any regard for the word of God. They believed the man. Tell us anything we shall do it. You know, until you lose your mind and that man's mind is your mind. And he told them, "Sell everything. Give me the money. I'm taking it to heaven. They said, "All right." They sold everything. They gave him the money. He packed them in a house. He He disappeared through a tunnel. And you know, he saw they saw him. They saw him shutting the doors. They saw him nailing the doors. You know remember they are cultivated to believe that this man is the one only the one man I don't know how he deceived them but he told them now we don't want like this is like Noah's ark the doors are being shut when the rapture is happening the ones who are on the will miss and these are not younger children, they're young and old, rich and poor. Anyone can be can be to be a part of a burnt alive. No one could escape. They believed in the man more than the world. Oh, their minds were spoiled. Instead of being after Christ, he was after vain deceit and philosophy and tradition of men. Even today in our country, Amen. We have a lot of cowards. I don't care what they believe, &gt;&gt; but we have a lot of courage. I wish I had the liberty to mention names. I cannot. But you see, if the spirit of God is in you, when we are done with it, you will you will do what Apostle Paul told us. You will be aware. You find you talk about their leader a person who was humble, nice and loving, they become like a devil, he will tell them I am speaking about the word. And if you're preacher, if you're apostle, if you're a bishop, is something contrary to the word is a false preacher and they will hear what you're preaching. They will see it is in the word because their bishop, their pastor, their pastor believes it differently. They will not follow you. They will take what their bishop had. That is a cult. [Music] What did brother teach? He said, and I'm just calling for him. He said, "If I say anything is not in the word, leave it alone. Amen. The Bible as the absolute said I preach what Paul preached. He said my words don't amount to anything. If it doesn't agree with the Bible leave it alone. You see, he gave the believers the understanding. This is not about me as Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, people came up one time because they saw the miracles, the power, the manifestation in the ministry &gt;&gt; and they came. It has been revealed to us. You are Jesus Christ. You yourself. You're Jesus himself. He said, "What? That's blasphemy. That's blasphemy. If I ever hear something like that again, I will quit the pulpit." and and the blood of the people would have been saved will be upon you. And you know this group said it has been revealed to us you should be the only one to preach and no one else. They are planning to sell their houses. They are planning to sell every thing they have so they can move to Jefferson. Okay. You told them you are mistaken. I'm just a preacher of the gospel. &gt;&gt; I am one of the so many around the world. And today we see that some spirit coming back in our gener saying only brother should preach and nobody else. Is this gospel about brother? &gt;&gt; This gospel is about Christ. Brother was a preacher of the gospel. His work was to lead us to Christ. That is the same old spirit. It's a countish spirit. [Applause] Amen. It takes the spirit of God for you to discern it. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul preached and he said follow me as I follow Christ. So it's not about me. I am just made a minister. Say I am just a list of the apostles. So it's not about me. It is about Christ. Follow me as long as I'm following Christ. Listen the same thing by himself. Amen. Hallelujah. And I tell you what friends, if there has ever been a preacher in this world that fought against brother. So you ask a question. Are there people who are believing what brother taught and they are a cult? Oh yes, there are so many. There are so many are there people who are believing what Paul said under a so many even in the city here are there people who believe what Jesus said and yes it's not about what you believe it's about how you operate it's about who has preeminence in what you believe. Hallelujah. Preeminence should be God having preeminence in us. But even Jesus himself when he was on earth, he never pointed to himself. Can you believe it? He pointed to God. &gt;&gt; He humbled himself. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was found in a fashion. So in other words, every preacher, Amen, that is pointing people to Christ, Amen. will not point to himself, will not point to his organization. But you hear them. If you leave us, you are lost. If you leave us, you are not the bride. If you leave us, and you know even people who claim to believe this truth, you find them beginning to have those attitudes. And actually people can can believe it so much to an extent. that they will fear to leave a church or a system even when they need to &gt;&gt; and they believe their salvation is rude to a church system. You see that's a cultish behavior. [Music] That's right. Paul said, "Be aware lest any man spoil you through philosophy, deceit, tradition of men, rudiments of the world." So we have liberty in Christ. Amen. God wants to lead his church. He wants to be the leader. &gt;&gt; And I know I read this quote in Ephesians church age on Sunday. In other words, take all of the sacredness and all of the power from the church and put it on the priests. Let the congregation live anywhere they want to, but the priest is the holy one. taking the Holy Ghost away from the people with signs and wonders following them and taking that away and give them the holy priesthood. Yes. Taking away the Holy Ghost and swapping it for a priesthood. You see in this church here it was it was a deeds and this place it become a doctrine. And it took over and when Luther came out, it couldn't stay that way. It went right back and took over again. Bishops, Cardinals, Archbishops, who in the world, they are the heads of the God's church. Who in the world is the head of God's church? he himself. And brother says, "Now I feel religious." The Holy Ghost was sent to rule the church, not just the preacher, the whole congregation. Oh brother, if it can come to a moment whereby Christ is having being the preeminent one in your life, You will love everybody. Even those in other fellowship, even those in the denomination, you will love them wanting to give them the truth. Hallelujah. Amen. And and I want to quote something here very significant. There's no way I can move on without quoting this in the church age book. He says, "Now, What was the spiritual climate of that church? It had left its first love. Leaving his first love of the word of God was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin and its origin was Pentecost. In a plain language, that means this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the Holy Spirit. [Music] the control of the spirit. Listen church God where now they're telling you your pastor should not preach to you Wednesday night, Sunday morning because God used a prophet. So you should play his tape. And even the tape you're going to play on Sunday morning is going to be sent to you from the headquarters and the bride all over the world should be connected to that. So God leads one man at the headquarters. and then everybody else follows. The church is in a danger of being taken away from the leadership of the Holy Spirit. But God wants to be the leader. God wants to be the ruler. God wants to be the bishop of our soul. The Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; In his bride. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God help us to see this. You see, this was exactly what took place after Moses led Israel out of the heaven. The way of God was to lead them by the cloud of fire. prophetic utterance, miracles, signs and wonders. This was to be accomplished. Hallelujah. Oh my my amen needs to be bigger for God to give you bigger revelation. Amen. You know what he says? The way of God was to lead them through the cloud of fire, prophetic utterance, miracles and signs, God-given wonders. And this was going to be accomplished by God selected, God ordained, and God equipped and God sent men. God selected, God, God equipped and God sent men. You believe that God today has men all over the world. Let me say this. In every country on earth, in every city on earth, in every village on earth, God has sent men. God has selected men. God has ordained men. God has equipped men. Amen. Going out to do. Amen. To bring prophetic utterance. Amen. to bring the miracle Sunday to move in the life of the church with the whole camp being dominated by a Holy Ghost move. Hallelujah. Just like DVF, God has sent us men who are preaching the gospel. But not only that, the whole camp, the whole church, Amen, is under must be under domination of the Holy Ghost. [Music] They rebelled. And they wanted a set of rules and creeds to go by. They wanted a king. They wanted to be exactly like the world. and went into complete apostasy and oblivion. That is exactly how the first church age started. Listen to what the prophet says. It will get worse and worse until the Holy Spirit is completely rejected and then God will destroy the people. See how it started out in the early church. It was called deeds. Then it became a doctrine. Then it became the standard. Then it became the unbending way. It finally took over and God was pushed aside. It started so small, so quiet. It's so inoffensively. It looked so good. It seemed so sound. Then it caught a hold like it caught a hold like a python. It squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality that was in the church. That's why brother Bam says the church is not ruled by a set of elders. [Music] We know most of the big denominations do that. They have elders council. The Roman Catholic Church has a curer called the the the the curia. It's in in Vatican whereby the cardinals council of cardinals they're the ones who choose the pope they they make laws. The Anglican church has a senate. The others have the the elders. Whenever the church is going to go in a certain direction they have to sit and make decisions. But brother says God's church is not ruled that way. God wants to be the ruler of his own church. Amen. Amen. Why do they have those kind of setup? Because God is no longer in their no longer the preeminent one. So what do you do? You have to go for the option. But we are not going to go for an option. We are going to go the God way. God wants to be the ruler of his own people. &gt;&gt; How did he rule them in the in the old? He had a man. He chose a man called Samuel. He anointed him. He ordained him. Then he sent him out. He said, "Go to my people. Give them this prophecy. Tell them that." And the people believed that was God. They never doubted. They never look left to right because they believed in the leadership of the Holy Ghost by a God called man. Today it is the same way. God sends us pastors, teachers, prophets. When a man comes on the platform, we believe he's not speaking his mind. He's speaking the mind of Christ. right now. You better believe the words I'm speaking are not my words. Amen. That's how God works. He sends money and it doesn't go. Amen. People also will be under the influence of the spirit in your heart. being the inside teacher will say amen. That means God has spoken. [Applause] Amen. So the God that leads a preacher on the pullpit is a God who will lead Amen. the children of God on the church. Let me tell you church, if a person comes up here and speaks something that is not a word, the spirit of God in you will point it out. That's why the seed of God cannot be deceived. Amen. And let me finish up this quote. It started so small, so quietly, so in offensively, and then like a python, it squeezed out the very breath and killed the spirituality that was in the church. Oh, that false vine is subtle. It is like an angel of light until it gets a hold on you. Now, I want to say that I believe in leadership. But it is not the leadership of men I believe in. Well, you ought to say amen to that church. I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Coming through the word. I believe also that God has set men in the church, men who are gifted by the spirit. and they will keep the church in order. Amen. It's not you know uh you know the nine spiritual gifts. It's not them that will lead the church. Those will defy the church. But it is the five-fold ministry that will lead the church by the word [Music] and they will keep the church in order. I believe that. I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge, but that rule is by the word. So that it is not men really ruling by the sp but the spirit of God. For the word and the spirit are [Music] praise the name of the Lord. And I told you that Christ is the center of your of the revelation. Christ in you makes him the center of life. It makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. Amen. Just give me a few more minutes here. What is the new birth? Then you will say, "Well, brother, what is the new birth?" It is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. Not you joined a church. You shook a hand. You done something different. You said a creed. You promised to leave by a corner room. But it is Christ, the Bible, he is the word that was revealed to you. And no matter what anybody say, what takes place is Christ, pastor, priest, whatever it may be, Christ in you. That is the revelation. The church was built on Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother, it's not about me. &gt;&gt; It's not about any pastor. We must learn as believers of the message to know what is more important. This message is not any man. It is Christ in you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That revelation of Christ personally to you. So no matter what anybody else say. Well, I can say if you do this, you're going to be cast. What does the word say? Does the word say that? That was just me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter what I say. But when what I say agrees with the word, then you need to watch out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The believer is a believer of the word, &gt;&gt; not a believer of a man, but a believer of the word. Hallelujah. I remember one time when I was in the Anglican church, the brother who was preaching to me, he said to me, he said, I told him, I went to my bishop and he said that he can also, they can also baptize by immersion. And then he said in Uganda to me he said your bishop with his gowns can he take you to water &gt;&gt; and baptize you. &gt;&gt; I was offended. I was offended. I I almost walked away from this message. I loved that man. I loved that man. I saw him almost like God. So who is this man? Even if what is saying is in the Bible? How can he speak about my bishop like that? I cried by the way. Seriously, I cried. That brother's name is Brother Paul. Brother Martin knows him and a few other I cried. How can you speak about that? So you saw they saw me crying. I don't know what they thought. They must have thought that the word hit me hard. But I was offended and heartbroken. How can he speak about my bishop like that? So I started getting my hand catching. He said, "Yes, yes, yes. This is the truth. this and he was making it harder on me. So I contined to cry and I wanted to walk away from this message. This is serious. This is truth. But I tell you what, there was a seed of God in me. Amen. What the seed desires is for Christ to have the preeminence. Amen. Not not not anything. Not a creed, not a man, not anything. But Christ, &gt;&gt; you've seen people leave church. Why? I was offended by so and so. Oh, church not a perfect place. You know, believers are hypocrites. That means that person is young in the faith. If you are mature in the faith, Amen. It might even be the pastor himself who might offend you or a brother or a deacon says something against you that is not true. Yes, it can happen. If you're mature, you're going to race. It's not about that guy. It's not about that brother or that sister. is about Christ. And I'm not here for him. I'm not here for her. I'm here for the one Christ in me. &gt;&gt; Where is the glory? Christ in you. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. And the Bible says that ye are complete in him who is the head of all principality and power. There's no room for camps. No room for camp when you are in Christ. No time and no room for camps. I've personally been with friends who pastors who wanted me to help them hurt their enemies. encouraging me to head the head not speaking like that. But you know someone doesn't come out open just begin speaking negatively about somebody else. So what do you do? You just immediately I shut off my ears. I don't have time for nonsense. I have time for Christ. I want Christ to be seen. &gt;&gt; I want him to be lifted up in me. I want that after I have served the Lord that he would say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant. This was not about you. It was about me." [Music] Amen. He wants to have the preeminence. He wants to have the preeminence. &gt;&gt; And and and friends, I'm I just I'm just going to quit from here, but I've not even gone into um anything that I wanted to talk about yet. But let us stand on our feet. When you begin to see People talk so much about themselves, talk so much about their organizations, their church, their accomplishments. Then it's no longer about Christ. [Music] What happened to talking about the souls we have won for Christ? [Music] What happened about having a burden for the lost soul? What happened about our desire to get deeper in the message to know him? The Bible says to know him is life at heart. How do you know him? You know him by receiving him. [Music] If Christ is in you, then is the hope of glory. You just want to be consumed by by him. Every part of your life, you want him to lead you to God. Even sometimes when everything is not dandy or or or good around, you come back to him. Say, Lord, it is you that I love. It is you that I I received. Lead me now. When was the last time you asked him to lead you before you made a big decision? You want to have him lead you. Touching Jesus is all that really matters. And your life will never be the same. [Music] There is only one way to touch. [Music] Don't believe when you call on his name. Oh, touching Jesus is all that really matter. And your life will never be the same. There is only one way to touch you. [Music] Just believe when you call on his name. Sing it again. Judging Jesus. in Jesus is all the tr [Music] and your love and your life will never be the same. [Music] Mary [Music] one way to touch. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just believe when you call on his name. [Music] where I'm coming back to over. [Applause] It's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I made. It's all about you. Hallelujah. It's all about you, Jesus. Lord, I'm coming back to the heart of worship you. And it's all about you. Hallelujah. It's all about you, Jesus. Oh, I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I made when it's all about you. It's all about you. Sing it one more time. Oh, I'm coming back to you. I don't &gt;&gt; Brother Amram about you. It's all about you. I'm sorry, Lord, for the dream I made. And it's all about you. And it's all about you, Jesus. I've wondered far. I will from home.
