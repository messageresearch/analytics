this by the way of the internet may you bless each and every one of us [Music] again this evening once again I was requested by Brother Jackson to also share with evening late bright Tabernacle is streaming this by way of zoom on their Channel so we send our greetings to the Saints there as well we are taking our Bibles the book of First Genesis the first book of the Bible Genesis Genesis chapter one verses 1 to 4. but if you're not kindly because so we're looking at Genesis 1. today videos [Music] are we happy to be in the house of the Lord so these are the first words in in your Bible in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters foreign praise the Lord come here may be seated I'm speaking to you today on chaos stand to order by the spoken one [Music] um God is not man to God is God and whatever God speaks man can speak presumptuous but God speaks surely that is why he the word of God is called a sure Word of Promise God speaks what he knows God and whatever he knows whatever he says powerful tell your neighbor God is what is powerful and you see no matter the chaos [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign he said well if they keep quiet the stones how could the stone shout because they would shout because they were they would have been under instructions [Music] everything must bow to the spoken word remember when uh Prophet Balaam was going to cast Israel God told him don't go and because he thought he was Heavy High minded a love of money more than lover of the word of God he thought that he had his own free will moral agency like many of us many times we think we can turn God and I'm twist him to do what we want um it has been established and so the prophet thought that he will you know God told him it's all right you can go again but that was permissive but the original word of God is usually the perfect will of God and so the prophet decided to go again with a permissive will of God can you allow me to say tonight that the will of God always stands you can bother yourself somewhere [Music] [Music] you know that's enough you cannot pass here and the donkey could see the angel of the Lord yes was full of himself I did not want to he did not want to hear the world that we had to say the animals [Music] but the man was so blinded that he could not see that this was an animal speaking [Music] foreign so God spoke in the beginning when God spoke in the beginning he did not speak to human beings today where no human beings forgot to speak to the world but God spoke his word into air the Bible says he had created heaven and Earth but the Earth was without forms and darkness was upon the face of the day that was chaos in the beginning there was chaos he spoke to chaos Hallelujah and he says let there be light who did God speak to Katrina there was no human being he was speaking to chaos he was speaking to all that confusion to the mixture of darkness and you know you know you know Waters and everything you know you know he spoke [Music] [Applause] the Bible says in verses um in verses 3 says and the spirit of God moves and the spirit of God moves do you know always the spirit precedes the word or whatever the judge and also always the spirit proceeds [Music] you cannot hear the word accept it and believe it without the spirit why are you here today why are you hearing this to those of you on zooming to those of you who are here you decided to come how come you were here the spirit of God to come to this place you know you see the spirit of God goes out fast yeah and then he brings the world now when the world comes you cannot receive the word without the spirit of God spirit of God will always precede the word and to proceed the words are you hearing me [Music] the spirit of God moves if you have someone next to you tell them the spirit of God the spirit of God moves and what we have time when God spoke the word and when the word went foreign foreign what happens when the spirit of God moves change when the spirit of God moves the word comes foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Proclaim [Music] Jesus is the light of the world we walk in the Life [Music] shine all around us Jesus the light where there is light did you know there are things that cannot stay when there is light when When God says there was a new day the Bible say even the Bible continues down here to say and God called the light day and the Darkness is called night and the evening and the morning was the first day oh praise the name of the Lord cockroaches foreign [Music] I can assure you you can no longer walk in darkness because the light is shining you are
