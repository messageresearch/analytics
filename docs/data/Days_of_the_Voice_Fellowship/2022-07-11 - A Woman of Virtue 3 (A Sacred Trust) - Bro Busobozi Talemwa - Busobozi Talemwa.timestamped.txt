[1:58] him in the into the garden of eden to
[2:00] dress it and to keep it
[2:03] underneath
[2:09] the lord god commanded the man saying of
[2:12] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[2:14] freely eat
[2:16] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[2:17] and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in
[2:20] the day that thou eatest thereof thou
[2:24] shalt surely die
[2:33] now
[2:47] a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he
[2:49] slept
[2:50] and he took one of the of his ribs and
[2:53] closed up the flesh instead they wrote
[2:57] down
[3:00] [Music]
[3:06] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[3:09] from the man made he
[3:12] a woman and brought her unto the man
[3:17] [Music]
[3:29] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[3:31] called a woman because she was taken out
[3:33] of man
[3:35] um
[3:49] shall a man leave his father and his
[3:51] mother and shall cleave unto his wife
[3:54] and they shall be one flesh
[4:27] to know that even as adam was taken even
[4:30] as eve was taken out of adams
[4:36] we have also been taken out of you now
[4:40] the man i'm such a we are the female
[4:43] part in that fetching rich because we
[4:45] are the church veganism we are the bride
[4:47] of god and we have come here this
[4:49] morning
[4:51] so that you can fashion us into your
[4:52] image
[4:55] that we will be pleasing to you took a
[4:57] sentence even my sincere prayer this
[4:59] morning
[5:00] you always see my childhood pleasing to
[5:02] you
[5:03] that whatsoever we do move your nadia we
[5:06] will be pleasing to you
[5:08] bless everyone lord why would your mum
[5:10] say brother every sister
[5:12] some workers have a long ways to be here
[5:16] unless they're heartbroken
[5:18] may this service be a blessing to
[5:20] everyone
[5:22] who
[5:46] foreign
[5:53] a woman of virtue part 3.
[5:59] can you get a better word
[6:22] and then
[6:23] but this morning i'm specifically
[6:26] speaking on a sacred trust
[6:47] i'm requesting that you uh put your
[6:49] undivided attention
[6:54] to the word
[6:56] movements as much as we can see
[7:43] because
[7:44] trust is a wonderful thing
[7:49] and then a trust
[7:51] uh
[7:52] is something that is given to someone
[7:54] checking to achieve
[7:57] when
[7:58] now the person who has received the
[8:00] trust is can be called a trustee
[8:08] and the trustee
[8:10] does not necessarily benefit directly
[8:13] from the trust
[8:19] but listen that trust is given to him
[8:22] for the benefit of others what would i
[8:24] take one more way
[8:39] but before we talk about the sacred
[8:41] trust that god has given please
[8:44] let's look at um
[8:46] at adam
[8:49] adam the bible says that the lord god
[8:52] formed man
[9:11] and if you look at verse 16 of chapter
[9:12] two he says and the lord god formed the
[9:15] lord god commanded the man saying of
[9:18] every tree of the god and thou mayest
[9:20] freely eat
[9:33] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[9:35] evil
[9:38] thou shalt not eat of it
[9:41] for in the day that you eat there shall
[9:43] surely die
[9:47] now this was a sacred track
[9:51] the lord who had entrusted to adam
[9:54] catherine
[9:55] adams god had given his word
[9:59] to his son and which comes to mind
[10:13] which is the tree of knowledge of good
[10:15] and evil
[10:31] of the gods
[10:32] but there was also the tree of knowledge
[10:34] of good and evil
[10:38] this was the second category
[10:40] also in the middle of the night
[10:43] now the tree of good of knowledge of
[10:45] good and evil
[10:47] and the tree of life
[10:49] we are only figurative trees
[10:54] it meant something more than just trees
[11:37] [Music]
[11:54] the image of god furniture why because
[11:57] he was eating from the tree of life
[13:12] the lord of glory this morning come away
[13:15] praise the name of the lord
[13:16] and so he told this man he came on earth
[13:20] and he
[13:21] told us we could eat him
[13:24] and he told us you could drink him
[13:27] because his brother was food
[13:30] and his blood was drinking
[13:31] which happened and he
[14:10] [Music]
[14:41] i am
[15:10] but within it has good and evil
[15:15] that was the man of sin
[15:18] he was the devil himself
[15:20] the bible says he was found in the
[15:22] garden of god
[15:37] praise the name of the lord
[15:40] [Music]
[16:02] [Music]
[16:06] that was
[17:16] and adam's saying now this is one of my
[17:18] bones and flesh of my flesh you shall be
[17:19] called a woman because she was taken out
[17:21] of it
[17:26] but then what happened after that night
[18:54] god
[18:56] has entrusted me
[18:58] with keeping this
[19:00] word for me
[19:02] we should never eat of this
[19:06] when the suffering came down he guided
[19:08] the woman
[19:22] said the serpent beguiled me
[19:27] and i did it
[19:32] praise the name of the lord my misery
[19:35] i'm keeping quiet for a moment because
[19:39] i wanted to imagine
[19:44] god himself
[19:47] trusting you
[19:50] if he trusts you well
[19:52] i'm so happy to see mr john
[19:55] trust you
[19:57] it means he has confidence in him
[20:02] it means
[20:03] he has decided to treat you as a trustee
[20:11] he believes
[20:13] that you will keep the trust
[20:15] always he believes in you
[20:18] um
[20:29] adam was the image of god himself
[20:51] [Music]
[21:01] [Music]
[21:27] [Music]
[21:45] listen now but the woman being deceived
[21:51] was in the transgression
[21:56] so the woman was deceived
[21:58] [Music]
[22:00] and because she was the one who was
[22:01] deceived
[22:02] [Music]
[22:03] she was in the transgression
[22:07] in genesis as you say this happened
[22:09] because
[22:20] [Music]
[22:37] [Music]
[22:39] when's the churchy
[22:41] all of you know what i doubt you my
[22:42] nobody's the movement so the scripture
[22:44] says
[22:45] that the woman was committed adultery
[22:50] she says after she has done it
[23:41] [Music]
[23:52] the first woman
[23:55] she was not able to keep the sacred
[23:58] tracks there are so many ways

[1:18:38] now i'm speaking now bringing this to an
[1:18:40] illustration to show you where the
[1:18:42] church stands

[1:21:41] life that god only himself can keep
[1:21:45] programming
[1:21:47] her husband might be the jumper but god
[1:21:49] has to produce the life
[1:21:55] it has to come all life has to come from
[1:21:57] god oblivion will never very catholic
[1:21:59] and a life come from god remember very
[1:22:01] catholic is perverted and that's what
[1:22:03] makes it sinful but life has to come
[1:22:05] from god
[1:22:08] is
[1:22:20] keep the church in mind while i'm
[1:22:22] speaking this natural this to a natural
[1:22:24] woman
[1:22:30] said in the seventh chapter of romans
[1:22:34] she has a sacred trust of virtue oh
[1:23:04] forward
[1:23:07] if she even does something wrong
[1:23:10] never correct jump she must confess that
[1:23:12] to her husband before he takes her i
[1:23:15] know
[1:23:18] and make it right now
[1:23:20] this kind of trust of virtue always

[1:24:30] husband for 10 years and then confess it
[1:24:33] he has a right to put her away
[1:24:41] that is scripture
[1:24:50] and i always told the brethren
[1:24:52] uganda if you married your wife as a
[1:24:54] virtuous woman

[1:25:59] that's not scripture
[1:26:02] only it is allowed
[1:26:04] if she committed fornication
[1:26:14] all right let's skip a bit here notice
[1:26:17] now
[1:26:18] she has a sacred
[1:26:20] trust
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:35] just as it was in the just as it was in
[1:26:38] the garden of eden
[1:26:41] she can say yes oh no
[1:26:44] she had a sacred trust i don't know
[1:26:47] where
[1:26:48] of
[1:27:14] look
[1:27:15] on this screen look on the screen and
[1:27:17] see this movie starts kissing
[1:27:21] and hugging and sloping around
[1:27:24] with women
[1:27:26] a woman does that is of a bad character
[1:27:29] oh my god
[1:27:36] but see
[1:27:37] when those six glands are in the lips he
[1:27:40] says the money kisses a woman he's
[1:27:42] actually potentially committed adultery
[1:27:43] homosexuals
[1:27:58] it wouldn't mix through their sex glands
[1:28:00] but the sex glance is in the lips
[1:28:12] but
[1:28:51] what kind of generation we are having
[1:28:54] we're truly
[1:28:56] no wonder our morals are rotten and
[1:28:58] decayed and filthy
[1:29:03] because it is put before the children
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:51] womanhood
[1:29:53] for where she can see whereby she
[1:29:55] shouldn't allow men to touch her body
[1:30:02] did you know that even the government
[1:30:04] sister allows you to go and see a man
[1:30:07] that has touched your body anyhow

[1:30:46] as
[1:30:47] an immoral object
[1:30:49] engaged into the away
[1:30:51] and so that's why even the devil has
[1:30:53] gone to women
[1:30:55] standing against the weather told them
[1:30:57] to undress
[1:31:00] their
[1:31:07] [Music]
