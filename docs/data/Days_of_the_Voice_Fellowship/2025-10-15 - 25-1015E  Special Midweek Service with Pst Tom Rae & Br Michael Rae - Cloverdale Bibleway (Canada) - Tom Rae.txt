Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I the only one that is happy? Is everybody happy today? Praise the Lord. Amen. We have this morning. We've been here with different pastors from uh different regions. I was actually given a brother Dan sent me a little bit of uh the numbers here. [Music] away from [Applause] Hallelujah. Come all the way to just come and fellowship with us this morning and this evening again and also to hear the word from the men of God. Thank you pastors for coming. God bless you. Amen. You know I told them I told brother Guma who's brother Guma very good friend of mine I told him look the pastors from Canada are sacrificing all all the to come all the way more than 27 hours of flight to just come here and so they have sacrifice on their part. I said if you pastors are also willing to sacrifice then I'm also willing to sacrifice. If you are willing to sacrifice and pay your transportation then I'm willing to sacrifice and take care of you. And so um I hope that all of you are happy and and we try to do our best in our little way. And um we are so happy to be with you and um also um 11 pastors from West Nile. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you so much. Men of God and 13 pastors from Tesso. Was I told another group was coming? Pastor Chance, was I told that another group was coming? Was there another group of pastors coming from Tessa? Two two more who who have joined. Okay. So that makes it 15. We really appreciate you. Thank you so much for coming all the way. The pastors from West Nile that is I've been there at pastor Nimong's place. It's almost Congo the other side of so God bless you so much making the effort to come you know we have been here in the morning and you know discussing with pastor Tom regarding the uh you know the work of translation and the printing of the message and the brothers we were speaking of their burden that was really very outstanding and uh we thank the Lord for for that moment. Also, I understand my pastor is here, brother. Where is he? Over there. God bless you so much, sir. Thank you for that. Amen. He knows how much um Cloal impacted my life and ministry. You know when I I I started I was very young. I believe the message at 15 years. I was preaching from when I was 13 years old. Then I believed the message three years later and and um um so then I started researching to try and find out are there believers of this message in the rest of the world because my mother had told me don't don't follow those people because they um believe they in a cult they believe a man called William Brown and find out it was not a cult. I found out they were not believing in brother but believing in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, my mother also believed. I don't know if she's here. Oh, mom, stand please. God bless you. And she was baptized in the name of our Lord. And so I mean I wish I had the time I would go through the whole story but I don't and so um at at that very young age I had too many questions and I wanted to research and find out more that's when I came across Bible and um tried to contact brother Edis tried and for a while didn't work but after a while of you know, he responded to me and um the rest is history. That man, brother Ed, really mentored me and I am what I am today in the ministry because of that man's testimony and uh he recently went to be with the Lord and brother Tom has stood with him in the ministry for over 50 years. and and um you know ministered with him and and I really was watching all their services. Brother services, brother Tom over there and they always did youth camps and the youth camps was all about preaching the word. I was so much touched by that and that is why I you know failed to also start doing youth camp and on our very first youth camp here Michael was the main speaker oh my he really blessed us really and um you know we've done it faithfully every year it's been a blessing to the region And we are so honored today to have pastor Tom Ray here to to me and to the church here is a blessing and being that you know they have stood behind the work of translation the work of printing the message. I was telling with the pastors, we are currently actually working on the on the Bible in Kama as well. And these are the brothers that have stood behind that because their burden and vision is not to just you know make men think you know like support people to support this message to God. And that's my burden and they supported me in Ethiopia and now in Ethiopia we have thousands of believers. So it's my honor and privilege this evening to introduce to you Pastor Tom, brother Michael. They're going to minister to us this evening. You can see I'm already on tension because I don't want to take much more time. I want us to hear the word. How many expectants? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like us to stand on our feet at this time. We'll invite brother Michael uh who um uh will just talking. I said, "Well, you'll be a John the Baptist. And um he will invite his father. [Music] These brothers just love the message. I love them because they love the message and I love you because you love them. If it was not the message of brother, we would not all be here. We thank God for the message. Praise God. Let us sing onlyly believe as our brother Michael comes. Oh, only [Music] [Music] all things are possible. Glory only. [Music] [Music] [Music] All things are possible. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing. Lord, I believe. [Music] I come all [Music] I for [Music] let all beosible. Lord I heavenly father tonight &gt;&gt; Lord there's a reason why you your prophet sang this song so many times [Music] Lord because you loved this song and you drew near Lord because it brought an atmosphere that you so much enjoyed to be in. So, Lord, how appropriate to sing the song tonight, because there's a group of believers here, Lord that are inviting you and desiring that you would be in our midst here tonight. So, Lord, we're wanting to tell you, we are believers. We believe your word tonight. That's what we come to feed on. So Lord, would your presence so just blanket over even feed our hungry souls. That we could leave tonight. We would say, "I know that my God is present among you." Lord, that's all we desire. Whatever word you want to say, we just come like Mary, sit at your feet tonight. Speak your word in Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's good to be back. &gt;&gt; My my I'm so so thrilled &gt;&gt; and I'm so glad I could bring my daddy back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm just as brother Bus said, I'm I'm forunning, I guess. &gt;&gt; I'm just so just so happy to see the brothers and the pastors that have come. We had just a special moment this this earlier today. Brother Tom and I went back to the hotel. It was hard to really put into words just what how you blessed us. [Music] You came all this way and you poured into us. I thank you from the depths of our heart. I I made the journey up to Kamoa and I know how long that is. And so I I can I just from my heart one of you that traveled from every distance, God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I think one brother said he said you know we brother Brandham said about you know coming to the jungles of Africa. It's a privilege and an honor to come here. I I just don't even know how to put it in. how special it is and it makes us feel so small. We are one body. One body. I'm so thankful I'm connected with people like you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm not going to take too much time. I'm going to try. Is anybody Are we Are we okay? But Arguma the brothers are going to get it in Kamoja too. Are we okay? &gt;&gt; Let's have the interpretation in Karamong. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The Luganda brethren, we have sacrificed you tonight. Oh my buddy. All right. Well, may the Lord open up heaven and help everyone understand tonight. And we'll we'll try and go slower, &gt;&gt; but no promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Cuz I have some ground to cover very quickly. &gt;&gt; And just give brother Tom a little jumping board maybe. &gt;&gt; All right, let's turn on to our Bibles. to Matthew 7. &gt;&gt; I know brother Tom will greet you from home. But in in Uganda, you greet each other twice. Greet one side, we greet the other. So I have to give you a double greeting from home. I'll greet you from one side and say, "Everybody back in Cloverdale, greet you. We love you. We're supporting you." And brother Tom's going to come and say the say the same words. &gt;&gt; And that'll just be the other side. Amen. Amen. Matthew 7 and verse 14. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way. Way, which leadth unto life, and few there be that find it. It says, "Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves." Jesus said, "Ye shall know them by their fruits." &gt;&gt; Very critical scripture. very important scripture. &gt;&gt; He says, "Do men gather grapes of thorns? &gt;&gt; Do men gather grapes of thorns or &gt;&gt; or figs of thistles?" He said in verse 18, "A good tree cannot bring forth evil, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit." Verse 20 says, "Then wherefore by their fruits, [Music] or if I could say it this way, by the life that is made manifest, ye shall know them." Amen. By their fruits, by what is manifested is proof on what's inside. Amen. Do you believe that? Amen. Amen. You may have your seats tonight. God bless you. &gt;&gt; You don't have to turn to it just for for time, but in Matthew 24. It says a very familiar scripture. For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and they shall shall show great signs and wonders. In that if it was possible, if it was possible, &gt;&gt; they shall deceive the very elect. [Music] That's this day. We live in a very deceptive age. I don't know about Uganda, but back home we get a lot of actually I have got them while I'm still here. So, do you get a lot of texts to your phone that are just scams? You know, they're trying to trick you into something. [Music] They're trying to They're trying to show you there's maybe a a better product or a better um I don't know, some some better product for life. [Music] You know, somebody's giving you money. You need to click the link. There's something you need and you know on the other side of it it's not true. But they try and make it look so correct. [Music] They're trying to deceive you. To draw you in. They say, "Hey, our fruit is good." [Music] &gt;&gt; You know, they just want you to click the link. But unfortunately, those that have clicked the links, they find out that the fruit's terrible, [Music] they go to their bank account and they find out the money's all gone. &gt;&gt; Right? So, everybody has some they're they're trying to promote a better idea. the world the world's full of different uh um aspects or or or products or ideas [Music] to try and produce a better life. Man, I drive down the streets. Everybody's trying to sell something to somehow improve your life in some way. [Music] &gt;&gt; But you know what? What happens is we can we can maybe purchase something. Maybe you're you're you're an exerciser. You like You're searching for maybe some way to to give you to give your life an infusion that you could produce something better. But you know what happens too often is that it just never produces the fruit you're looking for. And I don't think we've been in a in in a we're in the most critical time where God's people need to be so full of discernment. [Music] to know the intent, to know the spirit behind, to know the motive, the objective. We need to be able to see through. [Music] But to be able to see through, you need to have eyes that can see. Because on your own, you can't discern the deception of this age. Because scripture says, "If it were possible, it would deceive the elect." But something the elect has &gt;&gt; there's a difference between &gt;&gt; that gives you the ability to discern whether it's false or whether it's true. And without those eyes of this word, &gt;&gt; you will be deceived. Period. Period. There's no there's no middle ground. You're either deceived or you're not deceived. You either have something. You either have eyesight or you don't. There's not 18 flavors of eyesight. There's one eye. &gt;&gt; That's God's eye given through a prophet &gt;&gt; to give you the ability &gt;&gt; to see the deception &gt;&gt; and to see truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It sounds like we're on the same page. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says, &gt;&gt; he says the two spirits will be real close together. [Music] He said it will be closer at this end time. He says, think about this. At this last day, it will be so real. The spirit, the anointing of the age [Music] could be so close. You could walk into a church down the street and the anointing of the agent could be so close that it could deceive the elect. He said, "Brother Brando says, now how do you go? How how do we tell it in them days? [Music] How you're going to tell the difference today?" He says, "The same way. &gt;&gt; Stay with the word. It's not It's not complicated. It's not complicated. Stay with the word. That's why a prophet would come in this hour. Not pointing you to some other man or some other idea. But you know it's a true prophet when he points you always back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're dead. We're It's no secret. &gt;&gt; It's that we're in a very unique age. &gt;&gt; And I and I I mentioned this to the the people back home. [Music] If you've read the message, sir, is this the time? [Music] &gt;&gt; You would you would see how brother Brandon was kind of probing. He could see that something was changing. Something was coming to to be ahead of him. [Music] And I feel I told the people back home, I feel like we're almost at that type of place right now [Music] that something just lays just ahead of us. And when brother brother mentioned brother Bisco passing away [Music] brother Bisco preached the message like nobody else. If I can say bloodisco stayed with the word and that was very vital because all through the ages [Music] every time people got off the word they would fall into sin. And you can go back through the judges and you can see with Ehood and Shamgar and Deborah, Gideon or Samson, God would bring and raise up somebody to point them back to the word. But then there would be these in between times and they'd fall away. And then I think about either Peter, James, and John. [Music] You know, imagine those days if you could talk with Peter. &gt;&gt; You say, "Peter, what was it like to to sit with Jesus?" &gt;&gt; John, what was it like to to lay on his bosom and speak to him? And John would say, "Gather around." I want to tell you a little bit about what it was like. And he sit down and he start to tell them when we were at the last supper. And he started to tell us and during that time, that precious moment, he says, "I'm going to send you a comforter. &gt;&gt; I need to go, but I'm going to send you a comforter. I'm not going to leave you or forsake you. And he started to minister. Oh, John, what was that like? Oh my. The atmosphere was, how could I even express it? But you know what happened? John passed away. Peter passed away. Paul passed away. &gt;&gt; What now? What what do we do? &gt;&gt; The these ones that you know that were that were here but now now they're gone. What what now? Who's going to lead us? Who's going to guide us? [Music] &gt;&gt; I just wonder even in this hour [Music] at that time not when all that all passed away that had been there with Christ. What now? When all passes away that was been with the prophet when all the witnesses that were here when brother Brandham was here have all passed away. What happened? [Music] What do we do? You know we can't go we can't but is not going to speak and talk about when he was there on the log. What now? Do you think God was ever concerned? &gt;&gt; God was never concerned. &gt;&gt; God's never been worried &gt;&gt; that his life would not continue forth. God's never been nervous, &gt;&gt; whether his seed would continue onward. If there was a Samson &gt;&gt; or an Ehood or a Shamgar or a Peter or a Paul or a or an Iranius &gt;&gt; or a brother Brandham or a brother Biscll &gt;&gt; or a you [Applause] God's never been wondering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says, "Every spoken word of God is a seed." &gt;&gt; And so all those men through the ages spoke God's word as a seed that would be deposited into his people because God knew who would receive it. And so when a prophet spoke and the word was dropped into their soul and they responded, &gt;&gt; it brought life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses spoke seedword and it launched in the hearts of Israel [Music] which put Israel into action. [Music] They put the blood on the doorpost. &gt;&gt; They went and got a lamb from the backyard. They followed the word of the hour. [Music] It wasn't just in the mind. It wasn't just in the thoughts. But it was action life. They lived it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did it produce? It produced a power &gt;&gt; by following the word that put power in a blood that could put the on the doorpost of their home and would stave off. It would hold back death in the hour. It's the same in this hour. The same word has been spoken and you need to live it. Cuz in the living of it, it puts blood across your doorpost to stop death in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Brandham said, &gt;&gt; speaking about a child that was needing to be healed, [Music] &gt;&gt; she was going to die from cancer. I believe it was. And he said, "I never touched the child." [Music] He said, "I just went to the pulpit." He just came to the pulpit with the word. He said, "And the word healed her so instantly until she got up and walked away." &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's power in the word. That's where it lies. Stay with the word. He said the word went forth. &gt;&gt; She believed the word. The word is God's life. and God's power and what and the word is what it does. It heals the sick. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Elijah was God's word in that hour, held on to that word that Elijah spoke and out from that came life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Out of Elijah came the word and raised a dead boy to life. [Applause] Samuel had the word and brought a nation to life. Puted David on a throne. Jeremiah had the word. Preached a warning and said, "Repent. Get back to the word of God. to try to keep a people from destruction. But over and over and over, [Music] the words rejected. Rejected. Rejected. Samuel's word was discounted and set aside. [Music] &gt;&gt; And they put a Saul on the throne. Jeremiah was scorned and thrown aside. &gt;&gt; Elijah was rejected at Mount Carmel. &gt;&gt; But I'll ask you, &gt;&gt; did it stop the life? [Music] Did it ever stop the life moving through? It can't ever stop because even there was Elijah down in the dumps after Mount Carmel. But oh God, &gt;&gt; it's just me. I just need to go. Take me off the scene. It's It's over. No one else believes this word. Are we the only church in Uganda? Am I the only believer in my village? &gt;&gt; Oh, God. No. God said Elijah. You might feel alone. &gt;&gt; You might feel alone in Karamoja. You might feel alone here in Uganda. You might feel alone up by the West Nile. But God's here telling you tonight, I've got 7,000. I've got some other ones set aside. &gt;&gt; I got believers there in Cloverdale, &gt;&gt; in Europe, in China, &gt;&gt; all through Africa I've reserved unto me. My bride because my life has been deposited. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not alone, Elijah. You're not alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a few more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; The lifegiver himself. He said, "I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger. He that believeth on me shall never thirst." Can you imagine standing there &gt;&gt; listening to those words? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You think you'd just be like, "Well, I'd be just be revelated right there." &gt;&gt; Yeah. But if you go back to the scripture, some people heard that and in that same chapter, God breaks the natural bread and multiplies it. before their very eyes. He broke the bread and fed 5,000 people. He says, "I am the bread of life." And the creator is breaking the bread, showing them, vindicating behind it that I am the creator. &gt;&gt; I'm the bread. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that can sustain you. [Music] [Applause] But many of them said, "Well, give us a sign." [Music] He'd already given them a sign. And he continued through John 6, if you want to read it [Music] at some other moment. He continues to say through that chapter [Music] that he is he go he says, "I am the bread of life in 48. I'm the living I'm the living bread that came down from heaven. [Music] If any man eat of this bread, if any man eat of this bread, he was trying to get them to see something different. Not the barley bread in front of you, not the little flat bread in front of you. But me, him, he was the word. If you can partake of my word, you will have life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what did it do to those that caught it? &gt;&gt; What did it do to those that grabbed a hold of that? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Just a minority. Just very, very, very few. &gt;&gt; But God don't care how many few. All he cares is that the life continues. [Music] Amen. It just needs to continue. And the word ignited and birthed sons and daughters in the early church. Can you imagine? One man said, "The twel apostles were just ordinary men." &gt;&gt; He says, "But Jesus, &gt;&gt; the word formed them into the backbone of the church." Amen. Why? Why did they have such backbone? Not because it was something of the mind, not some idea that, "Oh, those sound like good words. Those sound like good words. It was more than good words. More than just a, oh, that's a lovely doctrine." No, it's more than that. It was a word that was deposited into a predestinated seed. Amen. igniting inside of them. &gt;&gt; A life. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what kind of life it was. &gt;&gt; If it was just man's life, Peter would have not walked to a cross and said, "I'm not even worthy to be crucified like my Lord. You can kill me, but upside down. You think that was just natural life that Andrew, &gt;&gt; John or sorry not John, Andrew, James, &gt;&gt; Thomas, Matthew, &gt;&gt; Philillip, Bartholomew, all of these disciples because they had partaken of the word. It didn't matter the circumstance. It didn't matter how difficult life was. Didn't matter how difficult and poor you are. The situations you're in. Peter was looking at a cross. They were looking at spears. They were looking at lions. They're looking at a burning stake. But something inside that had a life of its own. was the word that was placed inside of them. It didn't matter what came. It don't matter what comes if you have this word, this message. Why do you think we're so passionate about the message? Because if that's inside of you, it don't matter what Leoa can give you. I don't care how dark it is. You young people, I don't care how bad your school is. With this word, this life, you can run through the troop. &gt;&gt; You can leap over the wall. &gt;&gt; You can walk through and say, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did it end at Peter? All the disciples are gone now. &gt;&gt; No, no. Cuz the word, the bread of life, &gt;&gt; doesn't rely on you and me. It's not dependent upon our ability. [Music] You aren't having to try and figure out how to well, how do I live this life? It's so difficult. He doesn't rely on your ability. I just don't know if I can. You can't. He can. You I I can't do it by my merit. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm a good boy. I've been raised in the church. Good for you. You're still a wretched sinner because your life is nothing. But his life is everything. You better not be dependent upon your church. You can't be dependent upon just somebody or mom and daddy beside you. &gt;&gt; Well, they're a good mom and dad, so I'll just go on that. You need your own life. Brother Brandham said, Brother Brandham says we rely upon him. I'm quoting, not upon culture, not upon education, not upon the things of this world. Scripture says, not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. So then if you can't do it &gt;&gt; and I can't do it and I can't stand against the darkness, &gt;&gt; you can't stand against the darkness, then what does God have to do? What does he need to do to ensure that there's a bride in this age? He has to deposit his life into you and into me. And how will he do that? Through an Elijah. Because the word comes through a prophet and the prophet brings it to the people. And if you believe the words of a prophet, you are certain to have life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said &gt;&gt; he will be the strength of him. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will be the strength of him. Not his theological background, not his denomination, but the Holy Ghost will be his strength. [Music] He'll rely upon the strength of the Holy Spirit to turn the alien away. He says don't rely upon no speaking in tongues. He says but let the token itself be there. [Music] &gt;&gt; Like I said earlier God like I said has never bit his nails &gt;&gt; nervously. Oh dear goodness. you know, am I going to have a bride out of Leodysia? You know, is there actually going to be somebody there at the end time? Can can they really take the heat? Amen. Oh, Lord. as it came to maybe it's the seven church ages through the ages of time and he looked at the Catholic Church. He says, "Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Oh my, that's a really big foe right there. Can Martin Luther stand against it? You know, have I have I done enough to make sure Luther can stand at the door?" You know, wait, was God wiping his brow? Oh dear. Is Is Martin Luther going to make it? No. God never wiped his brow. God stood there waiting because he knew that Luther already had inside of him. And when the word activated at that hour, &gt;&gt; Martin Luther could walk to the gate and hammer the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And say, "I stand against the Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; This just, the just shall live by faith. In God wasn't wiping his brow. &gt;&gt; He was saying, "Well, look there. That's my boy. &gt;&gt; That's my son. &gt;&gt; That's my daughter. &gt;&gt; Look at them. &gt;&gt; Watch them stand in this age. &gt;&gt; Oh, he must have a little jubilee in heaven. When he watches you as you partake of the word, he watch you translators, as you scribble out the message, God starts to jump up and down to glory to God. My life has been activated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to stop cold turkey here pretty quick and then it's over to you, Dad. [Music] So, brother Brandham says, "Your name is Simon. You're the son of Jonas." Speaking to Peter, [Music] &gt;&gt; he says, "Who did he prove it to?" He says, "Why didn't he prove that word to Caiaphas?" But Ram says, "He was God. He knew Caiaphas would never believe it. [Music] But Peter &gt;&gt; was ordained to life and God knew it. So he couldn't reveal it to Caiaphas because he wasn't ordained to it. But you &gt;&gt; who are ordained to it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Wow, brother Michael, I just don't really feel the joy and the peace and the patience. &gt;&gt; I've never had a dream or I've never spoke in tongues. I'm going to read a quote for you." But Brandham says, "Oh, this is why the word is so important in this hour. Somebody gets a thought in their mind of what they feel the manifestation of God is and they go off this way and confuse so many people. But a prophet comes in this hour and says, "What is the fruit of the spirit?" The manifestation of the promised word. like, "Oh, it's it's uh it's not me jumping and shouting &gt;&gt; cuz brother brother Brandon was talking about Jesus [Music] and he was there with the whip and he was clearing out everything. Brother Brandon pointed to all the good rabbis [Music] and a good rabbi Good rabbi never said a bad thing in his life. The best of the best. &gt;&gt; My dear child, how can I help you today? Meanwhile, Jesus the word is clearing out the temple. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's violent. &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, he's destroying everything. How can we believe that? &gt;&gt; But he was revealing and manifesting the word in his hour. &gt;&gt; He was the word in the hour. &gt;&gt; And so people get so confused sometimes because they're missing actually the revealing of God in that hour. says, "Unless you accept the word of the hour when it's manifested before you, you're in you're in the same predicament." &gt;&gt; But Abraham says, "You can't rely on the shouting and this the tongues and all of this. The token is the word identified in you living itself out by their fruits. Know them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why in this hour when things get so deceived, just look at the fruits. Look at the life that's lived and in this in this hour in this age when every there's when the false and every demon it's the hour I could say of manifestation of both evil Darkness is is is pressing itself, but so is the hour for the wheat to be on full display. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's ever an hour when seeds are going to manifest, &gt;&gt; it's now. Don't you be surprised. &gt;&gt; Judas manifested who he was right at the cross. He held on all the way. But when the word was now to completely come to full effect, everyone manifested who they were. So don't be surprised when it's like, "Oh my goodness, what are they doing? How did they how could they make that decision? or how could they go here? I don't understand it. Peter and James and John, Judas, how could this be? But the fruit now was manifesting. But so &gt;&gt; is a John. &gt;&gt; So is a Peter. &gt;&gt; So is an Andrew. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a key. And here we are now. God's waiting. Can you &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if if God standing on the banisters of heaven looking down right now and he's been I've been waiting. He's waited all this time for the culmination of you. He's waited. He's excited to be able to prove to the word to the world I should say that his life that burst forth at Calvary to tear a bride out. &gt;&gt; He's been waiting for you. Can you imagine how excited he must be to see Uganda believers? Catch the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, I've been waiting. I've been waiting for a kamoja. I've been waiting for the alert. I've been waiting for everybody in this world. He must do a little joy dance. &gt;&gt; It's time. &gt;&gt; Angels, step aside. It's time. This is the hour that my life will vindicate &gt;&gt; that my message. &gt;&gt; Oh, is true all through the ages. &gt;&gt; There's a rapture coming. &gt;&gt; There's a rapture coming. &gt;&gt; Oh, we've heard it before. Yeah. Yeah. That life isn't really real. But there's a people that the seed has moved through time. It stayed steadfast, &gt;&gt; pure, &gt;&gt; virgin to come to this hour. this age where you actually prove God's word correct, God is able to take you and stand you before the world and say, "My life has always and will always have power to bring my bride back to my side. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Tamar, &gt;&gt; you know Tamar? Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's why Tamar, &gt;&gt; you know the story of Tamar. Tamar had Judah's seed placed in her. You read that story like that's a pretty intense story. &gt;&gt; And Tamar, &gt;&gt; get over here, Tamar. You're a prostitute. Stand here. &gt;&gt; You're going to be stoned. &gt;&gt; Burning. Tamar doing wasn't holding her head in. No, don't do it. &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to. &gt;&gt; That wasn't Tamar. &gt;&gt; Tamar walked with confidence. She stood there and she looked at everybody. As they're getting ready to light a fire, the heat around her started to get hot. The world is starting to get right in her face. Whose seat is this? And she brings out the signate and the staff to prove who it was. &gt;&gt; But you know why she could walk with confidence? because inside of her &gt;&gt; was Judah's life and she knew they couldn't touch her. &gt;&gt; If it was anybody else, she was dead. Anybody else, any other man, any other religion, any other hybrid idea, any other seed in the womb of your soul, you're dead. But Tamar held Judah's seed. And Tamar was then untouchable. You're untouchable &gt;&gt; because you carry the life of the land of the tribe of Judah &gt;&gt; by his word in this hour. &gt;&gt; You can walk confidently in this age. You can step forth in all darkness and you can say, "I know in whom I have believed and am persuaded." For he is able &gt;&gt; to carry me through no matter how dark, no matter how difficult. Because this message, &gt;&gt; this word of this hour has a life of its own to bring you and me to rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Tom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pick up your sword. It's your turn to swing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Accept the challenge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seeds in you to meet the challenge &gt;&gt; of this age. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God be with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Hallelujah. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe this? Did you believe this? &gt;&gt; We should be able to rejoice. When John saw his name in the book, &gt;&gt; all in heaven, &gt;&gt; all under heaven, &gt;&gt; he turn and say, "Glory, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise our King." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You think we're excited? &gt;&gt; We are a people of passion. &gt;&gt; Passion. The Bible says that the God, &gt;&gt; the mighty God, the prince of peace, the counselor, he's still mighty. And the Bible says the zeal of the Lord was in him. &gt;&gt; So if it was in the father, &gt;&gt; it's in his seat. God has a zeal, &gt;&gt; the passion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have a zeal tonight. It's not put on. &gt;&gt; It's a reality because it's not your life. It's God life in you. Who saved you? Who delivered you? Who brought this message by your way? God brought this message by your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "It was the resurrection coming to you." No different than Elohim coming to Abraham's. &gt;&gt; God coming to Abraham's death. God has come to your test. The resurrection has come to your test. zealous, &gt;&gt; passionate, &gt;&gt; glory, &gt;&gt; I've got something worth shouting about. &gt;&gt; It makes me sing and it makes me shout. &gt;&gt; It's not me. &gt;&gt; It's God in me. &gt;&gt; It's not you. that is God in you. &gt;&gt; Glory now. &gt;&gt; We are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Not we will be. &gt;&gt; But we are because of the life in the sea. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Glory. Michael got me all stimulated. Same life. Same life, brother Michael. Same life. Same life. &gt;&gt; It's got a life of its own. God life. Paul said, "It's no longer I that live, but Christ live in me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ live in you. &gt;&gt; You don't have a little seed of God. You have God. He's He doesn't diminish by just coming to Uganda &gt;&gt; and leaving Canada out of it. Leaving Canada bye-bye. God does not diminish. So what he does in Canada, what he does in America, he does in Uganda. Glory. He comes from the east, west, north, south. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Only this message makes this Bible alive. &gt;&gt; Your children don't need a dead gospel. Your children need a living God living in you that they can see you. That's the kind of God I want. &gt;&gt; A God in flesh. &gt;&gt; A God in flesh. &gt;&gt; A God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Let this mind. at this mind &gt;&gt; that was in Christ be in you &gt;&gt; who thought it was not robbery to become the sons of God. All creation groanth waiting for the manifestation this day. This scripture is being fulfilled now. We are the sons of God. Hallelujah. Amen. This message is not another doctrine. Do you understand that? This message is not another doctrine. I cause another church. Church is in the building. &gt;&gt; Church. Church. Church. Church. That's where God dwells. He dwells in your temple. Amen. When Michael was whipping, kicking over those benches in the temple, God came into your life, &gt;&gt; took all unbelief, &gt;&gt; whipped it out by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Clean the temple out so that God can come down and live in your temple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not just for the young men. It's not for just young men. But the same life that's in the young, the same life that's in the old, &gt;&gt; what can I say? The same life that was in the old is in the new. Glory. Amen. Amen. This revelation, this wine of stimulation. It's not a thought. It's the opening of the word. It's not the oil or the wine. Touch it not. Touch it not, devil. That's a stimulation from revelation. Take the book. &gt;&gt; Take the book. Give me the book. &gt;&gt; That's what I heard this morning. Give me the message. Take the message. And when that message came by our way, eat it. &gt;&gt; And what you eat is what you want. &gt;&gt; You don't take a little theology of past years and use then this message theology. Every time that life went up to stock, &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. No, we doing good. &gt;&gt; Good. Yes. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you give me five more minutes? &gt;&gt; So, as the life comes up, the sock stalk tassel shuck seat. So, as the life was going up, it was dying behind them. &gt;&gt; We don't want anything that was behind us. We want the cross before us. The world behind this. Give me this whole world. No. Give me Jesus. This message is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now when he comes down, &gt;&gt; I am his voice." &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't William Random. It was the microphone as we said this morning. Brother Brand was the microphone. That's why when he took the lady by the hand or discern their heart, he said whatever he said. Is that right? What was he doing? Removing himself and let it God come in and give him a temporal resurrection. Because it wasn't William Brham, it was the resurrection in William Brandom. &gt;&gt; You have to look around the room &gt;&gt; and say, "It's not brother Michael or brother Charles, &gt;&gt; brother Buzz. It's God himself living in the people once again. We're not in the stock. We're not in the tassel. We're not in a shock." As brother Michael said, &gt;&gt; you'll know it by the fruit. &gt;&gt; Oh, this message is so wonderful. It's just really stimulating. You haven't got it yet. You might have it here, but let the Holy Spirit bring it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Brown he came into the meeting and came into the Pentecostals and he saw this old man come up and brother Brown thought, "Oh my." I mean, how is he going to do this? But he said all of a sudden the Holy Ghost descended. He says, "Look out of the way. platform isn't big enough. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So, it's not your life as you heard tonight. &gt;&gt; It's God life in you. All this message is doing is confirming you always had eternal life. He said you never got eternal life and that you got saved. He said when Jesus came by &gt;&gt; and you said that's Jesus, &gt;&gt; it was proving &gt;&gt; you came from his thoughts. &gt;&gt; So if you came from his thoughts, you're going to go back to his thoughts. To God be the glory, passionate, zealous. &gt;&gt; You brothers, this message tonight came from you this morning. Amen. When you brothers brought the translations from in language when they smile. Huh. When you we I felt blood paper and I saw the pencil transcript. My heart started to burn. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then I want to say to you, &gt;&gt; take the book &gt;&gt; and you say, &gt;&gt; "Give me the book." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll prophesy again. &gt;&gt; What is he saying there? The one that was in William Brandon prophesied. But the bride is going to prophesy again. &gt;&gt; We're going to say what he said. &gt;&gt; We're going to do what he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ah, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Shall we stand as we read the word? &gt;&gt; Now, when you've had enough, &gt;&gt; if you had enough, you just go like this. Stop. Stop. Stop. Let my people go. Can we turn to Romans 8? &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8. &gt;&gt; We'll read at verse 15. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8. &gt;&gt; Verse 15. The Bible says, "For we have not received the spirit of bondage &gt;&gt; again to fear, &gt;&gt; but we have except we have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father, my father, my father." That's what your cry has been. &gt;&gt; God heard your cry in the East Nile. I preached. I told Michael as we were going back home at the hotel, I said, "Those brothers didn't know what they did to me today because I just preached on crying out." And brother Brandham preached on birth pains. Is that correct? Birth pains. And in birth pains, he said, "For a baby to know that needs something, it has to cry. So there's something in you crying out. We need to get the message in our language. And I say we're going to get the message to you in your language by the grace of almighty God. There's no more waiting, but it'll take time to get it to you. And if we're children, are you reading it with me, please? Verse 17. And if we're children, &gt;&gt; we're hes of God. &gt;&gt; Join hes with Christ. &gt;&gt; If so be that we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified together. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed. Where's the revealing? What does your Bible say is revealed in how do you say us? The words being mu &gt;&gt; in us &gt;&gt; in us &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; M &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In us in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're hes like servants. &gt;&gt; Live like sons. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joint hes with the anointed almighty God. &gt;&gt; That's why he says in the message, if God be with us, where's all his miracles? If God's with us, where's his miracles? If I'm air, where's the miracles that follow? I want you to look around the room. Go ahead. Turn around the room. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around. Look at Look at each other. Go. Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You're going to dwell with them in heaven. &gt;&gt; Huh? Oh, I can't look. I can't look. Each one here is a miracle. Come. I I I want you to see this. Brother Brham said you've got to become a miracle before you can see a miracle. Right? So then if if God has become a miracle in your life, then I can look at you and see the miracle. People say, "I want to raise them out of a a wheelchair. I want to raise them up. I I want the blind to see. I was blind. I was blind in sin and trespasses, but God rich in mercy put eyes on my eyes and the blind is now seeing. You're seeing it's not your ability, it's the ability of God in you. Joint hes with Christ. Amen. Verse 19. &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation of the creature waitth for the manifestation of the sons of God. Now since Paul wrote that to the Romans, that was a prophecy. As Michael was saying, brother Bram said, "In things that are to be." When Isaiah When Isaiah &gt;&gt; said, "A virgin shall conceive." That was the word of God. Traveling, traveling, traveling, traveling. But finally, it found the womb of Mary and brought forth the Christ. The prophecy was there will be a bride victorious without spot without wrinkle without sin without blemish. You're the spotless virgin bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; You okay? &gt;&gt; All right. I I was so enjoying brother Michael I was thinking keep on keep on it's getting real good you the mentality is this and I don't mean this disrespectful because I'm an old man all these young preachers I'm I'm an old man well let me ask you is the Holy Spirit old &gt;&gt; or is it young. Let me ask you, it it's your body that's getting old, but the spirit in you is young. So, we don't put the youth down and say, "What does he know?" It's God in the man. Is God in you? Recognizing God in one another. Hallelujah. So what brother Ram said, &gt;&gt; he said the greatest miracle is not bringing them out of wheelchairs or seeing the blind see or the deaf hear. He said the greatest miracle is for the word to come by your way and change you, change you from a sinner to a saint. Glory. Take that devil. Come on, take it, devil. Oh, &gt;&gt; brother, brother Tom, where are you getting this? &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Christ is a mystery God revealed. Then what was the theme of the song, right? What was the theme of the message theme? &gt;&gt; Christ in you. All that was in God, &gt;&gt; he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, &gt;&gt; he's poured into you today, this day, the sons of God are to be manifested. That's why the devil's trying to stop you from getting the message. We say, "Get behind us, Satan." Brother says in page n uh 86, he said, "Oh, the devil's howling about this, the manifested truth of the promised word in her alone." Not not in a serpent seed. in you. &gt;&gt; That's what the devil's helling mode. Because if you get this, you will always live in the victory of Christ. Brother Brandham says in this message book, the church, the bride is his victory. Hallelujah. Victory is mine. Victory is mine. &gt;&gt; Victory today is mine. &gt;&gt; I told Satan, get behind, &gt;&gt; victory today, tomorrow, the next day, the next day. Glory. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling mighty fine. &gt;&gt; I've got heaven on my mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said when Jesus said he said if I cast out devils by the finger of God, who do you cast among? He stood alone and his church stands alone. The denominations are going to turn on her. Christ is in her alone. Don't worry. Greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. I've got the life of God in me. I got the life of God in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got his life, his nature, his ability. I got the life of God in me. Amen. She is now risen. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. She is now risen &gt;&gt; by the vindicated word. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was in the old days a long-haired dope smoking hippie. But when Jesus came, he changed me. &gt;&gt; All I was seeing was the life in me. calling out to him. &gt;&gt; And when he came to me, &gt;&gt; I didn't go to him. &gt;&gt; Jesus found you. &gt;&gt; Jesus finds his seed. &gt;&gt; That's why he said Jehovah eagle. It's flying over. &gt;&gt; Not looking for chickens. He's looking for that last gene that was in that nest. &gt;&gt; It's me, mama. It's me. He heard the cry. He was stuck in the chicken coop. He looked &gt;&gt; He looked at the chickens. &gt;&gt; He looked at the denominations. He said, "They're nothing but eagle's food. Huh? &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the denominations. Don't worry about it whatsoever because the life has already gone out of it. The life of Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, we just laid a little foundation. &gt;&gt; Now, we get it to the the meat of the matter. Please turn in the Bible to Isaiah 9:6. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 9:6. as that seed was spoken by Isaiah. &gt;&gt; For it says, "Unto us a child is born, and unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called wonderful counselor, a mighty God." No, no, no, no. Say no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, no, no. It does not say a mighty God. &gt;&gt; It says the mighty God, &gt;&gt; not a trinity. The mighty God and to us a child is born. Unto us a son is given. It was God in flesh. He Jehovah redeeming fallen man. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You heard it tonight. He redeemed Andrew &gt;&gt; and Peter. &gt;&gt; And I always wondered when John the Baptist was at the river Jordan and the Bible says that there were lining the banks heresies, Sadducees. But John said, "Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world." How many left? &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, &gt;&gt; your Bible said, &gt;&gt; Andrew, Andrew, and another disciple, two out of the multitudes, Brother Ram said, one in a million. It's not many. And it's not everyone that says Lord Lord Lord will enter in. He says be gone for me. I never knew you. That new that new means epigenosco in the Greek it actually means a sexual relationship. As Michael was talking about Tamar, I never had relationship. I never knew you. I never communed with you. I never had relationship with you. But I've only had relationship with the elect of God, &gt;&gt; chosen in him before the foundation of the world. You were chosen, &gt;&gt; not by your pastor. &gt;&gt; You weren't chosen by me. &gt;&gt; You weren't chosen by any man, &gt;&gt; but Jesus Christ himself. What did brother say? Take your hands off of God's property. Satan, take your hands off of God's property. You're God's property. So God's watching over you. Be passionate. God's in my life. God's in your life. Hallelujah. unto us shall be called wonderful counselor, the mighty God. &gt;&gt; I want you to take a look at that word mighty God. &gt;&gt; That means algabon. &gt;&gt; That means the all powerful, no loss of power. It is perpetual life. God has just been dealing with me on perpetual life. Man is always looking for perpetual life. There's only one that has perpetual life and that is God life. And you've got perpetual life. You were just planted in the garden of the seven church. At the end of the seven church age, at the rising of the sun, that light was shining at harvest time. He says, "Can't you hear the combines coming?" the combine. Sorry. Can't you hear the combines coming tractor &gt;&gt; at harvest time gathering the grain? Can't you hear that? So, let me ask you a question. If the mighty God is in you, what's your problem? What's your problem? I got God in me. I'm passionate for the word of the Lord. Open the door. I just had a bad day today. Bad day. You got God in you. You can never have a bad day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When she realizes, when she realizes who she is, then the rapture takes place. Amen. Amen. So God had at harvest time one who came to maturity. And so God waved that sheath over you. So the life that was in William Brham, &gt;&gt; which was Christ, that same life is now in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, he says, "Face the challenge. That's why that's why David never ran away from it." He faced the challenge. He ran to his problem. He didn't run away from his problem. He ran to his problem and say, "Goliath today, I'll have your head." &gt;&gt; What was he doing? Prophesying again. Amen. He prophesied. He spoke it. And God came behind him and confirmed what he said. Brother said, "You speak it. You speak it. You speak it. &gt;&gt; I am God's victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, &gt;&gt; he said, "The high priest &gt;&gt; cannot move until first you confess it. I want you to say in your language, I am &gt;&gt; his &gt;&gt; victory. You say it, you watch the high priest come behind it. You want to speak doubt, the devil will come behind you. You speak truth and God comes behind it. I know in whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which he's committed unto me. Why? We have relationship with God. That seed as you heard is in you. I love it. It's not a doctrine. It's life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now we know that Jesus is the mighty God. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the mighty God. &gt;&gt; He's the algabon. &gt;&gt; He never diminishes in power. All that was in God, he poured into Christ. All that was in Christ, he now has poured into Christ. I am his victory. You say, "Brother Tom, where are you getting?" &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Michael, he he read out of Hebrews there where he talked about Samson and Gideon, the hall of heroes of faith. So, our hero Gideon was hiding behind Why? Because the Medionites, the Amalachites, the Amorites, children of the east, they were coming to destroy them at harvest time. When was it, brother Tom? When the life is back into the seed, that's when the devil wants to steal your life. But now we see in shadow form in the Old Testament. that Gideon was our type and God called him the mighty man of valor. &gt;&gt; What am I saying to you tonight? &gt;&gt; You're the mighty bride of valor. That was the masculine. We are the feminine, the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; He's the husband and we're the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here was Gideon hiding behind the wine press. &gt;&gt; And God didn't see his hiding. He saw what was in him. It's white. So, the Bible says in Judges, you can read it because we're trying to save time. In Judges chapter 7, the Bible says that God sent a prophet. God sent a prophet. He said, "The God that parted the Red Sea, &gt;&gt; the God that rained down mana, the God that brought you here into the land, he's the God of glory." But they had gotten away from God. But God's only interested in his seed. Do you get that? He's not interested in serpent seed. He's only interested in his own. He knew where Gideon would be and he planted himself at a tree after the prophet's message. Lord, the Bible says Revelation 10:1 after Revelation 10:7 was calling him the mighty man of valor. After the prophets gone off the scene, you might have thought, "I'm a little weak. I just got enough to feed myself." God looked past his flesh. He said, "You're not a weakling. You're a mighty man. Something was stirring in him. You wait here. You wait here." And he got himself a kid. And he made some rocks and he found a rock. He found the revelation of what the word said he was. &gt;&gt; And God said to him, "Drive out. drive out the enemy. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, I'll do that. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says that there's 135,000 innumerable &gt;&gt; coming into Israel. So Gideon mastered upon 32,000 500, you know, give or take 100. God said, "No way. If I let 32,000 let go, you'll say you drove them out. So, I'm going to divide the right from the wrong. That's what he's been doing for a long time now. Those that bowed down and lapped up their water, let them go home, they've been bowing to idols. But those that took the water up with their drank, He says those are the ones getting &gt;&gt; and there was only 300 out of 35,000 001% 01% one you got 1% &gt;&gt; 1% of 100 &gt;&gt; is 0.1 &gt;&gt; yeah that's good that's good they'll figure it out. A very small number &gt;&gt; because God wanted the glory, &gt;&gt; not you &gt;&gt; and not me. &gt;&gt; So Gideon goes and as now he's called the mighty man of valor. Okay, I need a sword like David. I need a sling. No, Gideon. No, no. Get yourself a clay pot. &gt;&gt; Get yourself a light. &gt;&gt; Put it in the pot. What are you going to do? No spear, no sword? No. But the revelation came the sword of the Lord and of Gideon. It wasn't a sword natural. The word of God is quick and powerful more than any other sword. Gideon had to believe the light in his vessel was enough to drive the devil out. And they gave a shout and a trump and it drove the enemy away. I say to you church in Uganda, rise up you mighty man. Be passionate, be zealous. The Bible goes on to say he went after Zorbin and he went after another king and he got him on the run. The Bible says he was weary, &gt;&gt; but he kept pursuing. You might be a little weary, but I want to encourage you tonight. Keep pressing on, Brian. Keep pressing on. You might be a little weary, but we're running the last lap. I see heaven just before us. I see a rapture change. I see a new body. and I'm passionate about it. Glory. So I say Uganda, put the light in your vessel. Put the light in your vessel and let the light shine for the glory of God. The enemy, we're on the run. May your lives in Christ put the devil on the run. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; We're just beginning. &gt;&gt; Come on, let's give the Lord another big hand clap of praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That was just too soon. We were just still enjoying or maybe they rest a bit and then we continue. Praise God, friends. You know, I I just love this message. This is not about, you know, any man. It's about Christ in us in you. And by the way, that's the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the essence of the message. It's Christ revealed in us. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. The bride is the mystery of Christ revealed. And we are so thankful for what we have had today. Amen. Let us give him a clap of praise. Oh, praise God. Amen. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Thank you so much, brother Tom. Thank you, brother Michael.

This has been a refreshing. We can now sincerely praise the Lord. Why don't the musicians come before we dismiss the service? We have to praise the Lord a little bit after what we have heard. Where's brother Brian? Come up here. I want us to sing that song. Though the way may be thorny, I will praise the Lord. I know brother Brian is wondering what song is that? I'm sure you sing that, don't you? Praise God. Let us stand our feet. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And maybe we sing it a little bit different, but Oh no man know my name.
