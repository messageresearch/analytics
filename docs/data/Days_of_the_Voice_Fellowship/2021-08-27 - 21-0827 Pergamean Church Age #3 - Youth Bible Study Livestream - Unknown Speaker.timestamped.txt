[10:24] today we are still on pegamos
[10:26] so discuss for us from pegamos not from
[10:30] the other ages that are much ahead
[10:34] i think you can have problems
[10:44] yes brother
[10:48] okay from there we go to sister
[10:52] sir lucas
[10:53] can you move that
[11:07] okay
[11:09] one one minute make it count brethren
[11:47] since from the beginning
[12:02] is
[12:15] page
[12:19] okay
[12:44] he was the first
[13:03] and
[13:14] [Music]
[13:18] heart believe
[13:22] supreme
[13:23] supreme eternal
[13:25] invisible
[13:27] who by the way
[13:29] for all things
[13:33] and that's his character he was
[13:36] he was lovely
[13:40] yes
[13:46] whatever he
[13:58] okay
[13:59] so that that's very good sister so
[14:01] you're trying to demonstrate to us that
[14:03] uh
[14:04] you know all people you know what moved
[14:06] you was that in the earth at one time
[14:09] everybody believed in one god
[14:12] another babylonian kind of uh
[14:14] teaching or religion
[14:17] of politics of many gods
[14:20] and that's very true and i indeed that i
[14:24] can see answer your question okay i'll
[14:26] pick you at random sister peace
[14:28] go ahead
[14:38] 191 okay go ahead
[14:55] oh okay even if you don't read you can
[14:57] just tell us what you learned
[15:11] did you say the false act
[15:15] where is that
[15:27] uh
[15:28] this is there anything like force elect
[15:35] can you read that portion
[15:52] hmm so your point is
[16:11] well
[16:12] there's something that i wanted to
[16:13] correct there
[16:16] there is nothing like a forced elect
[16:19] if you are an elect you are an elect
[16:23] if you are a fourth vine you are forced
[16:25] vine
[16:27] therefore the fourth vine
[16:30] is the one who is not the elect
[16:33] when we say elect
[16:46] can you translate elect in your language
[16:49] you cannot
[16:52] brother can you translate in your
[16:54] language
[16:55] what is it
[17:01] do you understand that
[17:04] do you understand about the polycarp
[17:07] now you understand and you say that
[17:09] again
[17:10] you know what it means it means what in
[17:12] another language which is not english
[17:14] and organic
[17:16] this economy
[17:21] but that's english
[17:25] can you explain it in your language
[17:28] if you explain it in your language that
[17:31] is the translation but can you explain
[17:33] who the elect
[17:44] is brother can you tell us what elect is
[17:48] in your language
[17:51] go ahead
[17:56] can you translate first before you
[17:58] explain
[18:00] in your language
[18:06] but you have explained it
[18:08] i wanted you to just give us one word
[18:09] for elect in your language
[18:12] like
[18:18] you speak the same language it's all a
[18:20] tessa
[18:21] okay now can you explain it in your
[18:22] language
[18:23] a bit louder
[18:38] uh
[18:55] okay can you tell us what a elect is in
[18:57] swahili
[19:00] yes what is it
[19:08] of course media means uh
[19:10] the bride but
[19:12] that is another translation but
[19:14] what is elect when you say elect
[19:16] because it can be something you know
[19:19] suddenly
[19:22] elected
[19:31] [Laughter]
[19:34] can you
[19:35] explain can you tell us in your language
[19:36] also
[19:39] yes
[19:49] so
[20:11] can you explain in your language sister
[20:12] what is elect in your language
[20:24] yeah go ahead my sister
[20:31] you can't understand it
[20:33] but you understand why
[20:35] but you don't understand if you don't
[20:37] understand the new language then you
[20:38] know it understood it
[20:41] you know where as you're reading this
[20:43] church age book you must be able to in
[20:46] to understand it in your own language
[20:49] some words which you do not put it if
[20:51] you can't put it in your language it
[20:52] means you've not just not clicked and
[20:54] you must write it as a question
[20:57] that's why i always receive questions
[20:59] because i believe that certain things
[21:00] you come across and you can't understand
[21:03] so an elect
[21:05] ah sister dr have you ever bought um
[21:08] like bananas or tomatoes in the market
[21:12] do you buy everything in the market
[21:15] what do you do
[21:18] you take what you want
[21:20] and finish the statement and
[21:23] and you leave what you do not want
[21:26] you take what you want and you leave
[21:28] what
[21:29] you do not want now what you want
[21:32] can i say that it is the erect
[21:36] you have elected it
[21:39] you want to elect our leader meaning you
[21:41] want to choose from among many you
[21:43] choose one in that way
[21:45] like someone
[21:47] will
[21:48] um you know go in the market choose
[21:50] something leave the others that is how
[21:52] god has elected us
[21:55] before the foundation of the world so we
[21:56] are the elect so sister in that way can
[21:59] you say false elect
[22:02] you can't because how can you be an
[22:04] elite again your fault
[22:06] it is impossible
[22:08] so if you are elect you are chosen from
[22:10] among
[22:11] the many and you are special
[22:14] because you are loved
[22:15] and you are taken
[22:17] hallelujah
[22:19] okay who else am i trying to sample
[22:24] uh
[22:25] brother
[22:26] you you are cheating you are very busy
[22:27] reading again
[22:29] i want people to tell me
[22:31] by volunteering
[22:32] what they read and they want to share
[22:34] with us from the pagan church age that
[22:36] they thought was so
[22:38] outstanding
[22:39] i think there's no one who has told me
[22:40] something again what were you sharing
[22:42] about
[22:47] oh no
[22:50] yes that was a very good one yeah people
[22:52] who used to believe in one god and then
[22:54] uh
[22:55] people who used you used to believe in
[22:56] one word but then later on
[22:59] the other religions came you know
[23:07] but uh somewhere
[23:31] it's about the
[23:33] kingdoms
[23:48] from
[24:11] then
[24:30] okay
[24:44] that
[24:58] a
[25:12] and which kingdom is that brother
[25:16] the roman empire is seen as which
[25:19] made you
[25:23] iron
[25:25] was the roman empire
[25:27] and now the iron
[25:29] and clay means what
[25:33] at first
[25:42] now
[25:48] we want to read the question for us
[25:56] the roman empire of iron
[26:35] was
[27:03] one of his heads appeared
[27:25] actually
[27:44] um
[27:55] is
[28:11] same spirit
[28:19] because
[28:37] to the church
[28:52] all right now you're already leaving
[28:54] your point
[28:56] can you go back to your afraid enough
[28:57] that you you have got the information
[29:02] now remember you're explaining it to
[29:04] someone who doesn't know what you're
[29:05] talking about and you need to make them
[29:06] [Music]
[29:09] make someone here know what you're
[29:18] the kingdom of iron
[29:51] okay
[29:52] fine
[29:53] i think brother from what you are you
[29:55] are saying
[29:56] i am understanding that you understood
[29:59] that
[30:00] you you always saw that there were four
[30:02] kingdoms
[30:05] and that you saw
[30:07] what was the first material
[30:10] by the way before we even continue
[30:12] some of you may not even know what
[30:13] you're talking about
[30:15] what are you not talking about
[30:17] we're talking about a dream of who
[30:20] nervousness what did nebuchadnezzar
[30:23] dream
[30:25] he dreamt a dream
[30:27] and he couldn't interpret it
[30:29] and these ways men couldn't interpret it
[30:33] and then
[30:35] he told them
[30:37] that they should interpret it they
[30:39] wouldn't
[30:40] and daniel was the only one who could be
[30:43] interpreted
[30:44] because he had forgotten it
[30:47] then for the one who was going to
[30:48] interpret it to first dream it then
[30:52] interpret it
[30:53] imagine
[30:55] someone comes to you says
[30:57] i've dreamt a dream it's troubling me
[30:59] the whole night
[31:00] but i can't remember it
[31:02] but i need its interpretation
[31:05] so surely you cannot you cannot
[31:07] interpret it before dreaming it you have
[31:09] to dream it and then interpret it
[31:11] so then i told him okay
[31:13] give me i think a few hours a day or so
[31:15] i'll come back in the morning
[31:17] he came back in the morning after
[31:19] dreaming the dream and receiving the
[31:20] interpretation
[31:22] that is how god got it god godly
[31:24] prophets operate
[31:26] hallelujah amen and that's why dreams
[31:29] they need divine interpretation
[31:32] don't just dream a dream you can dream a
[31:34] dream when you are seeing a brother
[31:36] buddy having a panga running after you
[31:38] then from that day you hate brother
[31:40] buddy you say this brother
[31:42] he is not a good person
[31:44] but that's a dream maybe the devil was
[31:45] the only person himself
[31:48] so don't always take dreams
[31:50] the way you see it and until god has
[31:53] interpreted it for you
[31:55] through
[31:57] his bible ways of interpreting dreams
[32:00] now
[32:01] the man dreamt a dream
[32:03] and
[32:05] danielle dreamt it also and he
[32:07] interpreted it for him
[32:09] and the dream was you saw one giant
[32:14] um what
[32:16] statues one giant statue
[32:19] and
[32:20] in that statue
[32:22] he saw that it had different elements
[32:26] major elements the head was the head of
[32:29] what
[32:30] gold
[32:32] the
[32:34] is the chest was the chest of what
[32:38] what
[32:39] silver
[32:41] then the
[32:43] thighs were thighs of what
[32:46] brass
[32:47] don't call it the brush
[32:49] it was brass
[32:51] then
[32:53] the legs were the legs of what
[32:56] iron
[32:58] the fate were the feet of what
[33:05] mixture of iron and clay
[33:07] it sounds like five kingdoms because
[33:10] each of that element was symbolizing a
[33:12] kingdom
[33:14] and the man of god say that oh king
[33:17] the dream your dream
[33:19] it is talking about
[33:22] the
[33:23] four kingdoms that are going to rule the
[33:26] world
[33:27] before the end
[33:31] the kingdoms of man and of course
[33:33] there he also saw
[33:35] one stone which was cut out of a big
[33:38] rock
[33:39] but that big rock
[33:41] that stone was cut out of the big rock
[33:44] without a hand
[33:47] but it was cut out and that stone came
[33:50] really
[33:51] [Music]
[34:00] they started went into smoldering ring
[34:05] and it was ashes
[34:07] so the man of god daniel said okay what
[34:09] you have seen is a great thing
[34:12] it is talk about the great kings and
[34:15] kingdoms that are going to be on this
[34:17] earth
[34:20] those kingdoms
[34:22] that's the dog
[34:24] and those kingdoms are going to rule
[34:28] the world in great power
[34:31] until the end
[34:33] and then the end will come
[34:36] when this stone comes and hits the stone
[34:39] which comes and it's this statue
[34:41] of these kingdoms of the world
[34:43] means the kingdom
[34:45] that is the kingdom
[34:47] of our god
[34:49] i think there is even a way called the
[34:51] kingdom of the son of god something like
[34:52] that
[40:18] three
[40:36] oh please forgive us our network went
[40:38] down
[40:40] we are now back
[40:50] okay so
[40:53] are we back now can you here
[40:56] so
[40:57] uh
[40:57] my back there
[41:00] all right so i was talking about uh
[41:02] what was i talking about
[41:06] no no
[41:09] yeah and here's the interesting part
[41:11] that i wanted you to hear it's very
[41:13] very interesting
[41:15] brother sam can you imagine that
[41:18] after nebuchadnezzar saw that
[41:21] he was so happy and excited
[41:24] that he said
[41:25] i have now an idea
[41:29] since this is god speaking to me
[41:31] in this dream
[41:33] sending is a prophet
[41:35] to to me also to interpret this dream
[41:41] now
[41:42] that said i've got an idea i've picked
[41:44] up an idea from all this thing
[41:45] and you know the idea which he picked up
[41:48] he said that
[41:49] i think this thing which i saw this
[41:51] vision in my vision i should do make it
[41:55] i should make it
[41:57] and they build this big image
[42:00] by my builders they are here they can
[42:02] build it and fashion it whatever the way
[42:05] it was with the head of gold
[42:07] and i know that the head is me so no
[42:09] problem
[42:10] and uh
[42:12] and then my kickoff so since this is my
[42:14] kingdom everyone in my kingdom must
[42:16] worship
[42:17] this
[42:18] netherlands or me must worship this
[42:20] image
[42:21] so he put up that image and he told
[42:23] everybody to bow down until
[42:25] worship said
[42:26] and we're not just going to worship it
[42:28] we are going to wash this image in style
[42:33] it will not just be a worship like
[42:34] kawaiita yeah it will be a very special
[42:37] wash
[42:38] you know how we say
[42:40] he said we are going
[42:42] to have all the musicians come
[42:46] all the ones that are banging the words
[42:49] the drums
[42:50] all the ones that having a keyboard yeah
[42:53] i don't know if they were skipping at
[42:54] that time
[42:55] all the ones having the apps other ones
[42:57] having the guitars all the ones are
[42:58] having they are doing all the ones
[43:00] having that
[43:01] they should all come together
[43:03] and they will play a very good melody
[43:06] [Music]
[43:09] now as you are hearing it when you hear
[43:11] that kind of thing all of you just bowed
[43:13] down in that style you know
[43:18] it was really amazing you know and it
[43:21] sounds like the music is of god
[43:23] it sounds like the images of god because
[43:25] god has the support you understand
[43:28] so let us worship the moment
[43:30] but there were some three people who
[43:32] said for us we shall not bow down
[43:35] you can buy but for us we shall not bow
[43:38] we shall not bow we shall not bend
[43:40] we only bow to the lord we only worship
[43:43] the lord god that's right hallelujah
[43:47] amen i love that kind of result
[43:50] amen there were young people and as he
[43:52] as young people in this generation we
[43:55] can also make that result
[43:56] that we shall only bow that we shall
[43:58] only worship we shall not worship money
[44:00] yes
[44:01] won't worship money women will not
[44:03] worship popularity we will not worship
[44:05] men those of you sisters will not
[44:06] worship these things of the world but we
[44:08] will worship the lord but there are some
[44:09] people when they smell money just as
[44:11] making of money oh my good lord you just
[44:14] know that
[44:15] they they've really felt it
[44:17] you know you will tell them to do
[44:18] anything and they will do it for you
[44:20] unless i mean as long as you talk about
[44:22] money you know man is involved
[44:25] you know they will they can even read
[44:27] this book in the
[44:28] in two hours if you tell them it is mine
[44:30] you know as long as it is fitting within
[44:33] their their desires you know some people
[44:35] have those kind of gifts
[44:37] [Music]
[44:38] gifts of love of money i don't know
[44:40] whether i should go to gifts but i think
[44:42] it's a spirit a very bad spirit yes very
[44:44] bad spirit if you have it here may it
[44:47] die in jesus name
[45:00] let us give you one more chance to bow

[46:12] hallelujah stand still
[46:15] stand still and see the salvation of the
[46:17] lord
[46:18] and so brother
[46:20] the the kingdoms you saw the last
[46:22] kingdom
[46:23] there was the first thing that was the
[46:24] one of nebuchadnezzar the second kingdom
[46:26] was the kingdom of the the the persians
[46:29] yes the the third kingdom
[46:32] do you remember the kingdom of the
[46:33] persians is the one we read of in the
[46:35] book of esther
[46:36] huh
[46:38] yeah king answers and the rest of them
[46:40] yeah then the greek empire the one of
[46:42] alexander the great you remember that
[46:44] was one of the greatest rulers that the
[46:46] world has ever seen
[46:48] then he was a very young man but he
[46:50] conquered the world you know
[46:52] but you see that they already knew known
[46:53] about it
[46:54] and then there was uh
[46:56] another one that is the roman empire
[46:59] you know all the
[47:00] the emperors of rome that have ruled
[47:02] this entire entire world
[47:04] at one time rome had the whole world in
[47:06] his hands
[47:07] but you see it it was it became as if it
[47:10] was destroyed and it was ruined
[47:12] but you see one of his head was wounded
[47:14] but he said that he did not die
[47:16] he did not die he came back again but as
[47:19] a divine
[47:20] empire how
[47:22] rome is still ruling now the whole world
[47:25] how not as rome but a divided empire
[47:28] romanism and protestantism
[47:31] did you know that
[47:33] the clay is protestatism whereas the
[47:36] iron is the roman romanism
[47:39] you know that was religious power today
[47:41] it is now not the rome the other room
[47:44] with the iron whatever feast that is the
[47:46] rome that is the religious rome today it
[47:49] is operating and ruling the world wild
[47:51] and the rabbi said it is seated upon
[47:53] many waters every nation you go to you
[47:55] find wrong even in when the pope was
[47:58] going to the
[47:59] the arab country here
[48:00] he still had very many members many
[48:02] people came to see the rome even the
[48:04] muslims
[48:05] so the rome has the whole world but you
[48:07] see
[48:08] now it looks like the other
[48:10] denominations are taking over but
[48:12] actually those denominations don't worry
[48:13] about them they are proxies of wrong
[48:16] their denominations they are declared
[48:19] and it sounds it looks like divided but
[48:21] actually those ones are all reconciling
[48:22] back with rome it is those that are
[48:24] going to betray you know the church it
[48:26] is those that are going to the devil is
[48:28] going to use to persecute the the
[48:30] foolish divided into those that the the
[48:32] angry
[48:33] the protestants they are the
[48:34] pentecostals or what they get
[48:37] those ones so we find ourselves in a
[48:39] position where we are not among them
[48:42] that's why the word of god says come out
[48:44] of harmony people do not be a partaker
[48:46] of her sin you see
[48:48] what we talk about the mark of the beast
[48:50] the map of that beast is going to be in
[48:52] operation
[48:53] at that time when rome takes over rome
[48:56] is going to take over again in this end
[48:58] time but it takes at this time it does
[49:01] not come in as in wrong it comes through
[49:05] the cancer of churches the cast of
[49:07] churches is going to be its image
[49:09] the bible calls it the image and like
[49:11] unto the beast it should have the same
[49:13] power like that of the beast like wrong
[49:15] it will be speaking on behalf of rome it
[49:18] will be operating on behalf of rome it
[49:20] will have that same power and that's the
[49:22] world power the last world power then
[49:24] the lord will come so you can see the
[49:26] world power is not america it is wrong
[49:28] even america is the best the bible
[49:30] speaks of america in chapter 13 of the
[49:32] book of revelation but still she also
[49:34] operates on behalf of rome because
[49:35] remember america is the one representing
[49:38] protestantism you know you know all they
[49:40] are
[49:41] they religious revivals of being in
[49:43] america you know and from america going
[49:46] to the rest of the world you know they
[49:47] pay the person for the move of god it
[49:49] seems but all these are going to be
[49:52] proxies of wrong you know that's why
[49:54] even brother banham says that
[49:55] the last pope who will be the beast the
[49:59] devil incarnate who will be an american
[50:02] somewhere he says that and also he says
[50:04] that it will be
[50:05] an american pope you know an american
[50:08] group and that
[50:09] surely you see it closing and actually
[50:12] the current bishop today
[50:14] uh the current pope today
[50:16] is a
[50:18] is from from south america
[50:20] such as from he is from america also
[50:23] so maybe it is him maybe it is another
[50:25] coming we do not know but what we did we
[50:27] see surely we know that everything is
[50:29] working towards the end it's working
[50:32] towards the end christ is fixing to come
[50:35] for his bride and i believe that you are
[50:37] ready
[50:38] are you ready
[50:40] can we now do a little readings from the
[50:42] church edge book uh the
[50:44] figure man church age
[50:46] and once we had
[50:48] i think today whether we finished it or
[50:51] not
[50:52] we are going to complete conclude i will
[50:54] start in the pigment church age

[51:02] and that i will be able to
[51:05] take time and teach on the church ages
[51:07] as well with the whole church
[51:09] i know
[51:10] that
[51:11] many have not have a bit before
[51:14] so
[51:16] we have been enjoying it here haven't we
[51:19] so let us just check and read as much as
[51:21] we can
[51:22] and if you can't i believe that each of
[51:24] you have read it if you have a question
[51:25] from apartment which are not rigged you
[51:27] ask you only have one hour now and so we
[51:30] are going to use it to do that
[51:31] and uh if you don't ask then i'll know
[51:33] that everything is okay you of
[51:35] understood so
[51:36] uh
[51:37] let us get
[51:42] i don't know whether you stop at last
[51:43] time
[51:45] just a subtitle
[51:48] will be fine
[51:55] let's talk about crystal against the
[51:57] church
[51:58] i know that what do we read
[52:04] on the salutation
[52:06] but for this one
[52:16] okay we're about to finish the citation
[52:22] i think there's one part that i want to
[52:23] talk about in the sanitation so
[52:26] i will begin with that
[52:28] one night as i was seeking the lord the
[52:30] holy spirit can i have that
[52:44] pick up my pen and write
[52:46] as i grasp the pen to write his spirit
[52:48] gave me a map oh
[52:50] yes let me
[52:51] project that for the ones who are on uh
[53:10] what you're going to hear is one of the
[53:12] very very important portions which you
[53:14] should not miss
[53:16] if you miss it you have missed
[53:17] everything
[53:22] oh i need to be sure that the others
[53:24] will hear the audio let me do this again
[53:48] one night as i was seeking the lord the
[53:50] holy spirit told me to pick up my pen
[53:52] and write
[53:53] as i grasped a pen to write his spirit
[53:56] gave me a message for the church
[53:58] i want to bring it to you
[54:00] it has to do with the word and the bride
[54:03] this is the message
[54:05] that god gave by the banham direct for
[54:08] the church
[54:09] call it a prophecy if you like
[54:12] and i want you to listen to it very very
[54:14] well
[54:15] okay can you put the screen so that
[54:16] everybody can see
[54:18] uh well i know that you have your books
[54:19] but in case you want to follow this as
[54:21] well
[54:29] here is what i am trying to say to you
[54:32] the law of reproduction is that each
[54:33] specie brings forth after its own kind
[54:36] even according to genesis 1 11
[54:40] and god said
[54:41] let the earth bring forth grass and the
[54:43] herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[54:46] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[54:48] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[54:51] so
[54:52] whatever life was in the seed came forth
[54:54] into a plant and bent into fruit
[54:57] the very same law applies to the church
[54:59] today
[55:00] whatever seed started the church will
[55:01] come forth and be like the original seed
[55:04] because it is the same seed
[55:06] in these last days the true bride church
[55:09] christ's seed
[55:10] will come to the headstone and she will
[55:12] be the super church a super race as she
[55:15] nears him
[55:16] they in the bride will be so much like
[55:18] him that they will even be in his very
[55:20] image
[55:21] this is in order to be united with him
[55:24] they will be one
[55:25] they will be the very manifestation of
[55:27] the word of the living god
[55:29] denominations cannot produce this wrong
[55:32] seed
[55:33] they will produce their creeds and their
[55:35] dogmas mixed with the word
[55:37] this mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid
[55:39] product
[55:41] the first son adam was the spoken seed
[55:44] word of god
[55:45] he was given a bride to reproduce
[55:47] himself
[55:48] that is why the bride was given to him
[55:50] to reproduce himself
[55:52] to produce another son of god
[55:54] but she fell
[55:56] she fell by hybridization
[55:58] she caused him to die
[56:01] the second son jesus also a spoken seed
[56:04] word of god was given a bride like as
[56:06] was adam
[56:07] but before he could marry her she also
[56:10] had fallen
[56:11] she like adam's wife was put to the test
[56:13] whether she would believe the word of
[56:15] god and live or doubt the word and die
[56:18] she doubted she left the word
[56:21] she died
[56:23] from a little group of the true seed of
[56:25] the word
[56:26] god will present christ with a beloved
[56:28] bride
[56:29] she is a virgin of his word
[56:31] she is a virgin because she knows no
[56:33] man-made creeds or dogmas
[56:35] by and through the members of the bride
[56:37] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[56:39] of god to be made manifest in the virgin
[56:42] the word of promise came to the virgin
[56:44] mary
[56:45] but that word of promise was he himself
[56:47] to be made manifest
[56:49] god was made manifest
[56:51] he himself acted at that time and
[56:53] fulfilled his own word of promise in the
[56:55] virgin
[56:56] it was an angel that had brought her the
[56:58] message
[56:59] but the angel's message was the word of
[57:01] god
[57:02] isaiah 9 6
[57:04] he fulfilled at that time all that was
[57:06] written of him because she accepted his
[57:08] word to her
[57:10] the members of the virgin bride will
[57:12] love him and they will have his
[57:14] potentials for he is their head and all
[57:16] power belongs to him
[57:18] they are subject to him as the members
[57:20] of our bodies are subject to our heads
[57:24] notice the harmony of the father and the
[57:25] son
[57:26] jesus never did anything until it was
[57:28] first showed him by the father
[57:31] john 5 19
[57:33] this harmony is now to exist between the
[57:35] groom and his bride
[57:37] he shows her his word of life she
[57:39] receives it she never doubts it
[57:42] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[57:44] death
[57:45] for if the seed be planted the water
[57:47] will raise it up again
[57:49] here is the secret of this
[57:51] the word is in the bride as it was in
[57:53] mary the bride has the mind of christ
[57:56] for she knows what he wants done with
[57:57] the word
[57:59] she performs the command of the word in
[58:01] his name for she has thus saith the lord
[58:05] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[58:06] and it comes to pass
[58:08] like a seed that is planted and watered
[58:10] it comes to full harvest serving its
[58:12] purpose
[58:15] those in the bride do only his will
[58:18] no one can make them do otherwise
[58:20] they have thus saith the lord or they
[58:22] keep still
[58:24] they know that it has to be god in them
[58:26] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[58:28] he did not complete all his work while
[58:30] in his earthly ministry so now he works
[58:33] in and through the bride
[58:35] she knows that
[58:36] for it was not yet time for him to do
[58:38] certain things that he must now do
[58:41] but he will now fulfill through the
[58:42] bride that work which he left for this
[58:44] specific time
[58:47] now let us stand like joshua and caleb
[58:50] our promised land is coming in sight
[58:52] even as theirs did
[58:53] now joshua means jehovah's savior and he
[58:56] represents the end time leader that will
[58:58] come to the church even as paul came as
[59:00] the original leader
[59:02] caleb represents those that stayed true
[59:04] with joshua
[59:05] remember god had started israel as a
[59:07] virgin with his word but they wanted
[59:10] something different
[59:11] so did the last day church
[59:13] notice how god did not move israel or
[59:16] let her go into the promised land until
[59:18] it was his own appointed time
[59:20] now the people might have put pressure
[59:22] on joshua their leader and said
[59:24] the land is ours let's go and take it
[59:27] joshua you are all through you must have
[59:28] lost your commission you don't have the
[59:30] power you used to have
[59:32] you used to hear from god and know the
[59:34] will of god and act quickly
[59:37] something is wrong with you
[59:40] but joshua was a god sent prophet and he
[59:42] knew the promises of god
[59:44] so he waited for them he waited for a
[59:46] clear-cut decision from god and when the
[59:49] time came to move god placed the full
[59:51] leadership in joshua's hands because he
[59:53] had stayed with the word
[59:55] god could trust joshua but not the
[59:57] others
[59:58] so it will repeat in this end day
[1:00:00] the same problem the same pressures
[1:00:04] take the example we see in moses
[1:00:06] this mighty anointed prophet of god had
[1:00:08] a peculiar birth
[1:00:10] being born at the right time for the
[1:00:12] deliverance of abraham's seed from egypt
[1:00:15] he never stayed in egypt to argue
[1:00:16] scripture with them nor fuss at the
[1:00:18] priests
[1:00:19] he went to the wilderness until the
[1:00:21] people were ready to receive him
[1:00:23] god called moses to the wilderness
[1:00:25] the waiting was not on moses part but
[1:00:28] because of the people who were not ready
[1:00:29] to receive him moses thought the people
[1:00:32] would understand but they did not
[1:00:35] then there is elijah to whom the word of
[1:00:37] the lord came
[1:00:38] when he got through preaching the truth
[1:00:40] and that group back there that is the
[1:00:42] forerunner of the american jezebel group
[1:00:44] would not receive the word
[1:00:46] god called him off the field and plagued
[1:00:48] that generation for rejecting the
[1:00:50] prophet and the message that god had
[1:00:51] given
[1:00:53] god called him to the wilderness and he
[1:00:55] would not come out even for the king
[1:00:58] those who tried to persuade him to do so
[1:01:00] died
[1:01:01] but god spoke to his faithful prophet by
[1:01:03] vision
[1:01:04] out of hiding he came and brought back
[1:01:06] the word to israel
[1:01:08] then came john the baptist
[1:01:10] christ's faithful forerunner the mighty
[1:01:12] prophet for his day
[1:01:14] he did not go to his father's school nor
[1:01:16] the school of the pharisees
[1:01:18] he went to no denomination but out to
[1:01:20] the wilderness called there by god
[1:01:22] there he stayed until the lord sent him
[1:01:24] out with the message crying
[1:01:26] the messiah is at hand
[1:01:29] now let us take a scriptural warning
[1:01:31] here
[1:01:31] was it not in the days of moses whom god
[1:01:34] had vindicated that korah rose up and
[1:01:36] withstood that mighty prophet he
[1:01:38] disputed with moses and claimed that he
[1:01:40] had as much from god to lead the people
[1:01:42] and that others shared in the divine
[1:01:44] revelation as well as did moses
[1:01:46] he denied the authority of moses
[1:01:49] now the people back there after they had
[1:01:51] heard the true word and were well
[1:01:53] acquainted with the fact that a true
[1:01:54] prophet was vindicated of god
[1:01:57] i say those people fell for korra and
[1:01:59] his gain sayings
[1:02:01] quran was not a scriptural prophet but
[1:02:03] the people in great numbers with their
[1:02:05] leaders went for him
[1:02:06] how like the evangelists today with
[1:02:08] their golden calf schemes like korras
[1:02:11] they look good to the people as cora
[1:02:12] looked good then
[1:02:14] they have blood on their foreheads oil
[1:02:16] on their hands and balls of fire on the
[1:02:18] platform
[1:02:19] they allow women preachers let women cut
[1:02:22] their hair wear slacks and shorts and
[1:02:25] bypass the word of god for their own
[1:02:26] creeds and dogmas
[1:02:28] that shows what kind of seed is in them
[1:02:31] but not all the people turned on moses
[1:02:33] and left the word of god
[1:02:35] no
[1:02:36] the elect stayed with him
[1:02:38] the same is happening again today
[1:02:40] many are leaving the word but some are
[1:02:42] staying with it
[1:02:43] but remember
[1:02:46] the tears have to be bundled for burning
[1:02:49] these apostate churches are getting
[1:02:51] bound closer and closer together ready
[1:02:53] for the fires of god's judgment
[1:02:55] but the wheat is going to be gathered to
[1:02:57] the master
[1:02:59] now i want you to be very careful here
[1:03:01] and see this
[1:03:02] god has promised that at the end time
[1:03:05] malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled
[1:03:08] it has to be for it is the spirit
[1:03:09] quickened word of god spoken by the
[1:03:11] prophet malachi
[1:03:13] jesus referred to it
[1:03:14] it is just before christ comes the
[1:03:16] second time
[1:03:18] by the time jesus comes all scripture
[1:03:20] must be fulfilled
[1:03:21] the gentile dispensation will be in its
[1:03:23] last church age when that messenger of
[1:03:26] malachi comes he will be right with the
[1:03:28] word
[1:03:29] he will take the whole bible from
[1:03:31] genesis to revelation
[1:03:33] he will start at the serpent's seat and
[1:03:35] carry on to the messenger in the latter
[1:03:36] reign but he will be rejected by the
[1:03:38] denominations
[1:03:41] he has to be for that is history
[1:03:42] repeating itself from the time of ahab
[1:03:45] israel's history under ahab is happening
[1:03:47] right here in america where the prophet
[1:03:49] of malachi appears
[1:03:51] as israel left egypt to worship in
[1:03:53] freedom pushed out the natives raised up
[1:03:56] a nation with great leaders like david
[1:03:58] etcetera
[1:03:59] and then put an ahab on the throne with
[1:04:01] a jezebel behind him to direct
[1:04:03] so have we done the very same in america
[1:04:06] our forefathers left for this land to
[1:04:08] worship and live in freedom
[1:04:10] they pushed back the natives and took
[1:04:12] over the land
[1:04:13] mighty men like washington and lincoln
[1:04:15] were raised up but after a while other
[1:04:18] men of such poor caliber succeeded these
[1:04:20] worthy men that soon and ahab was set in
[1:04:23] the presidential chair with a jezebel
[1:04:24] behind him to direct him
[1:04:27] it is at such a time as this that the
[1:04:29] messenger of malachi must come
[1:04:33] isn't this happening in america right
[1:04:35] now where king ahab
[1:04:38] is set in the presentation chair
[1:04:41] with a woman president jezebel behind
[1:04:43] him to leave you he's right here
[1:04:45] right here
[1:04:46] i have not seen it
[1:04:50] right there
[1:04:52] look at it there's soon ana set in the
[1:04:55] presentation chair he doesn't know it's
[1:04:57] no longer soon
[1:04:59] that one has now come to pass
[1:05:02] would sit in a presidential chair
[1:05:05] with a jezebel right behind him to
[1:05:08] direct you
[1:05:10] actually they're saying
[1:05:12] many people are ready that
[1:05:13] it is kamala harris
[1:05:16] that is actually doing the things but
[1:05:18] not
[1:05:19] by then because biden is an old man and
[1:05:21] he's all slow and sluggish and he
[1:05:23] forgets so easily
[1:05:25] so people are saying that i actually
[1:05:26] this camera has the vice president
[1:05:29] who is behind him doing everything
[1:05:31] directing him
[1:05:33] directing the country
[1:05:35] and the prophet says it's
[1:05:37] at such a time
[1:05:39] it is in that generation
[1:05:41] where malacca must come
[1:05:44] where the prophet the messenger of
[1:05:45] malachi elijah must come
[1:05:48] and you remember that
[1:05:50] also prophesied that
[1:05:52] there will be
[1:05:54] um a a a woman president
[1:05:57] you see and he said you young people
[1:05:59] write it down
[1:06:00] because he knew it will happen in our
[1:06:02] time because we the young people of that
[1:06:05] time
[1:06:06] would still live in this same generation
[1:06:09] where elijah has come
[1:06:11] can't you see
[1:06:13] these things are in prophecy if you
[1:06:14] people want to play christianity and to
[1:06:16] joke around continue but as for me i'm
[1:06:19] going to be serious with my god
[1:06:21] because if you are serious with god you
[1:06:23] are rest assured that this
[1:06:26] when he when he comes he will find you
[1:06:28] ready
[1:06:29] when the rapture comes you will be
[1:06:31] prepared
[1:06:33] do you know what it means to know this
[1:06:35] message and you're not going to rapture
[1:06:38] let me tell you it is the most terrible
[1:06:40] thing that can ever happen to you
[1:06:42] because you have had everything you know
[1:06:44] everything which means you are the
[1:06:46] person who is not going to take the mark
[1:06:48] of the beast because you know how can
[1:06:49] you take the mark of the best when you
[1:06:50] know joining their systems is giving you
[1:06:53] the knock of the business and you are
[1:06:54] left behind and you are forced to go and
[1:06:56] join their systems
[1:06:58] actually bottom says it would even come
[1:07:00] down to where people had to buy or sell
[1:07:03] goods physical goods
[1:07:05] you know if you don't have uh
[1:07:07] this mark but you see the mark of course
[1:07:10] you get by joining their systems by
[1:07:12] joining that but then if you're not
[1:07:14] joining their systems then you'll be
[1:07:15] kicked out from the uh from being able
[1:07:18] to sell or to buy even even physical as
[1:07:20] much as it applies spiritually but also
[1:07:22] even physically
[1:07:23] so it's coming to a time whereby the
[1:07:25] squeeze is coming in but of course it is
[1:07:28] going to be at the same time when the
[1:07:29] bride will go and then those who will
[1:07:31] remain
[1:07:32] will think it is a
[1:07:34] it is
[1:07:35] a you know domino thing that's when they
[1:07:37] realize things are tough
[1:07:39] unless you subscribe to be a part of
[1:07:41] either the roman catholic church or to
[1:07:43] be a a an affiliate of those that have
[1:07:46] joined it the council of churches you
[1:07:48] are going to be tormented and
[1:07:51] and you you will suffer
[1:07:52] to the extent that you cannot join
[1:07:54] because you're not to join it is to go
[1:07:56] into the lake of fire and bloomstone so
[1:07:58] you will say well to you your options
[1:08:00] you'll not be trying to assess your
[1:08:02] options what options do i have lord and
[1:08:05] you'll only have two options either you
[1:08:07] join them and you go into the lack of
[1:08:08] fire brimstone oh you don't and they
[1:08:11] kill you they die you die they make you
[1:08:13] suffer you think you just
[1:08:15] put a blood through your head no
[1:08:17] you will die by suffering
[1:08:20] you will go through a very big
[1:08:22] time of suffering let me tell you it is
[1:08:25] good for someone to just kill you and
[1:08:26] you die immediately
[1:08:28] but for someone subjected to suffering
[1:08:30] and torture
[1:08:33] what would be the purpose for them to
[1:08:34] subject with suffering and pressure
[1:08:36] don't say it has never happened it has
[1:08:38] happened before
[1:08:39] it happened during the time of the that
[1:08:41] again we ready didn't we
[1:08:43] where the women were being thrown into
[1:08:44] the lions coming together and some
[1:08:47] sometimes they would they cut and rip
[1:08:49] their stomach open with their babies
[1:08:51] inside and they leave them there
[1:08:54] they have not killed their heart they
[1:08:55] have not killed anything they might have
[1:08:56] left them there for the blood to
[1:08:59] completely get out of them
[1:09:02] and they die out of
[1:09:03] what
[1:09:05] praying and suffering because the
[1:09:08] point here is we are leaving you here
[1:09:10] for as long as you have not recounted
[1:09:11] your christianity
[1:09:13] maybe when you recount we can run come
[1:09:15] put it together and take you for sahaja
[1:09:17] yoga
[1:09:18] so you will be there once you're
[1:09:19] suffering you're suffering until the
[1:09:20] last moment
[1:09:22] then they they realize that that one is
[1:09:24] going to die after all then they just
[1:09:25] said please let their lives
[1:09:28] just come and eat you up
[1:09:30] when you have not died but when you are
[1:09:31] almost
[1:09:32] dead ah
[1:09:34] just eat you like that
[1:09:36] now it might not be done the same way
[1:09:37] but what will be done in our generation
[1:09:39] will be worse than what was done because
[1:09:41] the demons that are losed out of here
[1:09:44] the demons that are losed out of the
[1:09:45] river frontless are here on earth and
[1:09:47] there are very many i'm telling you
[1:09:48] they're just roaming around waiting whom
[1:09:50] they will develop but they are going to
[1:09:52] devote those who will let me left here
[1:09:53] during the the tribulation the
[1:09:55] tribulation is not a time for you to be
[1:09:57] in
[1:09:58] i'm not trying to make you get scared so
[1:10:00] you can leave your sin if you want to
[1:10:02] continue wallowing in your sin but let
[1:10:04] me tell you if it was me
[1:10:07] if i were you
[1:10:08] i would run away from all
[1:10:10] these things that easily be said to me
[1:10:12] and i commit my life to alcohol
[1:10:15] i commit you know some of you say well
[1:10:18] i've not committed my life to christ i'm
[1:10:20] not committing my life to anything right
[1:10:22] now i want to be free
[1:10:23] don't deceive yourself
[1:10:25] each of you here
[1:10:26] and those of you online have committed
[1:10:28] your life to something
[1:10:33] yes
[1:10:35] you have committed your life to
[1:10:36] something
[1:10:37] no one can live in this world without
[1:10:39] committing his life to something
[1:10:41] no one
[1:10:42] if you're not committed to christ then
[1:10:43] you have committed into something
[1:10:45] and i will tell you if you have not
[1:10:46] committed it to christ you have
[1:10:47] committed it to sinking son
[1:10:49] if it is education it is seeking sin
[1:10:52] if it is married it is seeking son if it
[1:10:54] is the worldly pleasure they are saving
[1:10:56] son
[1:10:57] if it is those those other things they
[1:10:59] are seeking sun
[1:11:01] the only thing that is not seeking sun
[1:11:03] is christ
[1:11:05] christ is not shaking it's not a seeking
[1:11:07] sun christ is permanent are you hearing
[1:11:09] me christ is permanent his word is
[1:11:12] permanent his life is permanent in you
[1:11:15] in me will be real and therefore to you
[1:11:17] who have refused to commit your life to
[1:11:19] christ then let me tell you to make it
[1:11:22] like summarized for you you have a
[1:11:24] community
[1:11:27] because if you commit your life to
[1:11:28] christ you can have education
[1:11:32] you can have
[1:11:33] a house you can have a car you can have
[1:11:35] everything you need
[1:11:37] for his save christ that he will provide
[1:11:40] to you everything that you
[1:11:43] need whatsoever that you desire
[1:11:46] but
[1:11:47] the thing that you must do is to do what
[1:11:51] is to do what
[1:11:54] how do you do that
[1:11:57] he said he said believe in jesus christ
[1:12:00] and accepting all these righteousness
[1:12:03] committing yourself with you
[1:12:05] like your
[1:12:06] life you know
[1:12:08] whatever you say from today
[1:12:11] the number one in my life is jesus
[1:12:16] if
[1:12:17] i'm going to be involved in anything in
[1:12:19] this world the question is i'll ask
[1:12:24] i will ask a question
[1:12:26] the very first thing that i will do i'll
[1:12:28] ask a question
[1:12:31] is it pleasing to my jesus
[1:12:34] if it is not pleasing to him
[1:12:37] then i will not be
[1:12:39] engaged in it
[1:12:41] that is how you commit your life to him
[1:12:43] you be like
[1:12:45] lord
[1:12:46] i'm going to live for you and let me
[1:12:48] tell you i'm not telling you what i did
[1:12:50] do i did this
[1:12:52] about 15 years ago now
[1:12:55] and
[1:12:56] let me tell you
[1:12:58] god
[1:13:00] must bless you
[1:13:01] if you commit your life to him
[1:13:04] your life to the rest will even be a
[1:13:07] mystery
[1:13:08] they can't understand nothing about you
[1:13:10] because
[1:13:11] you are living in another world
[1:13:13] you are a citizen of another world
[1:13:16] if you say if a citizen of america
[1:13:18] a citizen of great britain a citizen of
[1:13:20] these first one countries is highly
[1:13:23] respected let me tell you
[1:13:25] an african
[1:13:27] moving or traveling from one african
[1:13:29] country to another african country with
[1:13:32] an african passport will not be
[1:13:34] respected
[1:13:36] but if i i i i even if you are not an
[1:13:38] african it doesn't matter your race
[1:13:40] doesn't matter your skin care but if you
[1:13:42] have a passport from america or a
[1:13:44] passport from great britain and you
[1:13:45] travel some of these african countries
[1:13:47] the everybody will just give you that
[1:13:49] special kind of treatment as if you're
[1:13:51] coming from man
[1:13:54] why because to them to be a citizen of
[1:13:56] that country it means you're a great man
[1:13:58] a great woman
[1:14:00] it means that that possible to have that
[1:14:02] passport you are having it in the name
[1:14:04] of your country and in the name of your
[1:14:05] president or your leader
[1:14:07] so anyone who does anything back to you
[1:14:09] is doing it not to you but it's doing it
[1:14:11] to your country did you know that
[1:14:13] that's why a passport is such a very
[1:14:15] respected and a very big thing for you
[1:14:18] to have
[1:14:21] a passport is accepted internationally
[1:14:22] wherever you go if you have a passport
[1:14:25] and you go into a country and you lose
[1:14:27] your passport you are going nowhere
[1:14:29] you have lost your identity
[1:14:32] you you can't even deport you to any
[1:14:35] many many years ago when they do not
[1:14:37] have thumb print and things which they
[1:14:39] can use to check person to check you
[1:14:41] just go somewhere you know some of these
[1:14:42] people they will just go go into america
[1:14:44] go to some of these countries and they
[1:14:46] ask them where are you from you know
[1:14:48] they lose their their passport they just
[1:14:49] flourish in a trailer or something and
[1:14:51] then they just come up i don't know
[1:14:52] where i came from
[1:14:54] what is your name i forgot
[1:14:57] what the name of your parents i don't
[1:14:58] know
[1:14:59] are you married i i don't remember they
[1:15:02] behave crazy
[1:15:03] they behave crazy that they don't
[1:15:05] remember where they came from they don't
[1:15:06] remember you know even how they came
[1:15:08] where they are and then eventually they
[1:15:10] become citizens of the u.s
[1:15:12] but of course these days they will
[1:15:14] actually just take you to a by force and
[1:15:16] then you know take a thumb break off of
[1:15:18] you and you know facial recognition or
[1:15:19] whatever they say yeah we got you they
[1:15:22] just deported back to your country
[1:15:25] one of these young men that they went to
[1:15:27] they went to what what country was it
[1:15:29] this athlete you know was it germany i
[1:15:32] think it was one of those european
[1:15:33] countries
[1:15:34] huh
[1:15:50] or something i think they eat a lady
[1:15:52] more for something so it's hard to
[1:15:54] disappear into the country but of course
[1:15:56] technology is quite high these days so
[1:15:58] they called him and they brought him
[1:15:59] back home
[1:16:02] they brought him back home so what are
[1:16:04] we talking about a passport is a very
[1:16:06] good thing if a country can be respected
[1:16:08] because of your passport that you have
[1:16:10] you are representing that country you
[1:16:12] what's your passport
[1:16:13] what is it reading
[1:16:15] what is it reading
[1:16:18] your passport your passport must be the
[1:16:21] passport of heaven
[1:16:24] in the name
[1:16:25] you know like you'd write the passport
[1:16:27] you see in the name
[1:16:29] of the queen of england
[1:16:31] respect so and so
[1:16:33] a citizen of this country you know
[1:16:36] in the name of the king of heaven
[1:16:38] respect so and so
[1:16:40] grant him all his desires
[1:16:43] because the citizen of heaven
[1:16:46] that's what god does to all of his
[1:16:48] children
[1:16:49] if you commit your life to him fully
[1:16:51] unresolvedly hallelujah
[1:16:54] he he is in charge of your life he is
[1:16:58] not only in charge of your life
[1:17:00] he is in charge of everything about you
[1:17:04] why because you are a citizen of his
[1:17:06] country
[1:17:08] like right now people are locked up and
[1:17:10] they and they are locked up in
[1:17:11] afghanistan
[1:17:13] and because of the taliban taking over
[1:17:15] power
[1:17:16] but every country is not fighting for
[1:17:18] the country of another
[1:17:20] for the citizens of another country
[1:17:22] you know i say that the citizens of
[1:17:24] great britain
[1:17:25] already many of them already taken out
[1:17:27] so the americans are yelling and you
[1:17:29] know there's a lot of shouting in
[1:17:31] america no let the president you know
[1:17:33] how can you we should be impeached many
[1:17:35] of them have been on tv you should be
[1:17:36] impeached you know
[1:17:38] removing you from office
[1:17:40] how dare he leave the citizens of this
[1:17:42] country behind the enemy lines how dare
[1:17:45] you do that why are they speaking with
[1:17:46] all that people because they are also
[1:17:48] citizens of the same country
[1:17:50] let me tell you if you're a citizen of
[1:17:51] heaven even when god does nothing to
[1:17:53] save you amen the whole angelic realm
[1:17:56] will be there hallelujah
[1:18:08] you know and he was crying and that he
[1:18:10] was going to be hungry than that you
[1:18:12] know he was crying there you know but
[1:18:14] i'm saying that jesus being the lord of
[1:18:16] weather he should have called and enjoy
[1:18:18] the course
[1:18:19] just say michael come down with all your
[1:18:22] battalion let me come and show these
[1:18:24] people some fire
[1:18:25] but they never did that
[1:18:27] all angels could have come down when he
[1:18:30] was on the cross
[1:18:31] but about him said that the father
[1:18:33] looked the other side
[1:18:35] maybe the angels came to the father said
[1:18:37] father let us go down and save him your
[1:18:40] son is dying
[1:18:41] and he was like i don't want to hear
[1:18:43] nothing
[1:18:46] now let me ask you a question
[1:18:48] if god
[1:18:51] was so
[1:18:52] mindful of jesus christ
[1:18:56] do you think that jesus christ would go
[1:18:58] through anything without a good reason
[1:19:02] whatever he went through was for a good
[1:19:04] reason he suffered so that you can be
[1:19:08] he suffers but you
[1:19:10] can be saved therefore if you suffer and
[1:19:13] you a child of god your suffering will
[1:19:15] be there but you are suffering for right
[1:19:17] causes right purpose but what i'm saying
[1:19:19] my brother and sister give your life
[1:19:21] live your life for a cause
[1:19:23] a right cause the cause of the gospel
[1:19:27] leave for it
[1:19:30] i think that by the end in the last
[1:19:32] meeting that we are going to have i
[1:19:33] think we are going to have to have some
[1:19:35] of you really make a commitment
[1:19:37] really make a commitment
[1:19:40] on
[1:19:41] living
[1:19:43] for the cause of christ
[1:19:45] you know
[1:19:46] a commitment
[1:19:48] and i don't think you should wait until
[1:19:50] then you can do it now amen and make
[1:19:52] that commitment so i'm going to live for
[1:19:54] christ
[1:19:56] the whole world is sinking sound
[1:19:59] all at the ground
[1:20:02] is
[1:20:03] [Music]
[1:20:19] [Applause]
[1:20:22] is
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:35] oh may god help us to do that i tell you
[1:20:37] if you do that you never regret in this
[1:20:39] life you will watch over every state
[1:20:41] that you take
[1:20:44] then in the latter rain will come a
[1:20:46] mount carmel showdown
[1:20:48] watch this carefully now to see it in
[1:20:50] the word
[1:20:51] john was the forerunner of malachi 3.
[1:20:54] he planted the former rain and was
[1:20:56] rejected by the organizations of his day
[1:20:59] jesus came and had a mount
[1:21:00] transfiguration showdown
[1:21:02] the second forerunner of christ will sow
[1:21:04] for the latter reign
[1:21:06] jesus will be the showdown between the
[1:21:08] denominations and creeds for he will
[1:21:10] come to back up his word and take his
[1:21:12] bride in the rapture the first showdown
[1:21:15] was mount carmel
[1:21:16] the second was the mount transfiguration
[1:21:19] and the third will be mount zion
[1:21:21] behind the enemy lines
[1:21:23] oh do you have to shut them into that
[1:21:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:36] the strange behavior of moses elijah and
[1:21:38] john withdrawing from the people into
[1:21:40] seclusion left many confused
[1:21:43] they did not realize that it was because
[1:21:45] their messages had been rejected
[1:21:47] but the seed had been sown the planting
[1:21:49] was over
[1:21:50] judgment was next
[1:21:52] they had served their purpose as a sign
[1:21:54] to the people so judgment was next
[1:21:58] i believe according to revelation 13 16
[1:22:01] that the bride will have to stop
[1:22:02] preaching for the beast is demanding the
[1:22:04] mark in the hand or forehead if
[1:22:06] permission to preach be granted
[1:22:08] denominations will take the mark or be
[1:22:10] forced to quit preaching
[1:22:12] then the lamb will come for his bride
[1:22:14] and judge the great harlot
[1:22:17] now remember that moses was born for a
[1:22:19] certain work but he could
[1:22:22] then lamb will take his bride to be ever
[1:22:26] at his side
[1:22:28] all the hosts of heaven will our same
[1:22:31] body
[1:22:34] oh it will be our glorious sight oh the
[1:22:38] saints in spotless white
[1:22:41] jesus
[1:22:45] oh i think we should say that again oh
[1:22:48] the lamb will take his bride
[1:23:03] glorious
[1:23:13] [Music]
[1:23:17] preaching
[1:23:18] then the lamb will come for his bride
[1:23:20] and drag the great heart
[1:23:22] but down there he also up there he also
[1:23:24] said that the bride will have to stop
[1:23:29] preaching for the beast is demanding the
[1:23:31] mark in the hand or in the forehead if
[1:23:34] permission is to be granted
[1:23:38] hallelujah
[1:23:39] the reason why i returned back from
[1:23:42] ethiopia
[1:23:44] having gone to ethiopia and fully
[1:23:46] forgotten about uganda
[1:23:48] but i decided to come back
[1:23:50] was because they say the government it
[1:23:52] passed a new regulation and said
[1:23:55] that if you're going to be a pastor
[1:23:58] within the country of ethiopia you must
[1:24:01] have certain requirements that are
[1:24:04] known as the basic requirements
[1:24:06] and one of the basic requirements was
[1:24:08] that you must have at least a training
[1:24:11] from a theological college
[1:24:13] and so
[1:24:15] is there no other way because at first i
[1:24:17] was using my certificate the ordination
[1:24:19] certificate
[1:24:20] but they said no you have to have a
[1:24:23] training from a theological college
[1:24:27] and with theological college
[1:24:30] it means that i have to either join a
[1:24:33] roman catholic college
[1:24:35] a seminary at a roman catholic seminary
[1:24:38] or pentecostal theological college or
[1:24:40] some of those colleges
[1:24:42] of course you know that the message uh
[1:24:44] believers we are not a denomination
[1:24:46] therefore we cannot have any of those
[1:24:48] organizational staff
[1:24:52] because
[1:24:53] we are called out of those things
[1:24:55] into
[1:24:56] a higher place
[1:24:58] therefore we
[1:25:00] chose not to be trained by men but like
[1:25:02] paul we chose to be trained by god
[1:25:04] himself
[1:25:05] and by the holy ghost and so
[1:25:08] and and so they told us that that's what
[1:25:11] i had to do so i i told that brother
[1:25:13] they said i'm sorry i'm not gonna do
[1:25:14] this. so they thought i was joking maybe
[1:25:16] others are maybe you can just simply go
[1:25:18] and get by people outside but that is
[1:25:20] corruption then
[1:25:22] if i'm going to stay in the country
[1:25:24] preach because i'm being corrupt
[1:25:28] on the basis of corruption then my god
[1:25:29] cannot move
[1:25:31] i'd rather go back and preach in the
[1:25:33] country as a visitor
[1:25:35] than to stay in the country and preach
[1:25:37] as a corrupt official spiritual official
[1:25:42] and so i had to leave i couldn't preach
[1:25:44] so i couldn't stay and preach
[1:25:47] simply because i don't have the
[1:25:49] requirement and the prophet is
[1:25:50] prophesying here
[1:25:52] by the way these are the things that the
[1:25:53] spirit of god told him take a pen and
[1:25:55] what right that the bride will have to
[1:25:58] stop preaching for the beast is
[1:25:59] demanding the mark in their hand or in
[1:26:01] the forehead information is to be
[1:26:03] granted and how will you get that mark
[1:26:06] by just joining their
[1:26:08] things and doing what they want you to
[1:26:10] do
[1:26:11] but if you can compromise just a small
[1:26:14] thing now what is wrong with getting a
[1:26:15] paper from them you know it's just like
[1:26:17] going to any
[1:26:18] university it seems but it is not it is
[1:26:21] a deception of the devil man he wants to
[1:26:24] take your soul he's interested in your
[1:26:25] soul and some of you he will have to
[1:26:27] find a way to capture you he tried to
[1:26:29] capture me and i escaped
[1:26:31] i refuse to accept
[1:26:33] and time is coming where it is going to
[1:26:36] be the same thing in every nation
[1:26:39] here in uganda they also passed a law
[1:26:41] number one for a church to be recognized
[1:26:43] at church it must be seated on one acre
[1:26:45] of land
[1:26:46] number two
[1:26:47] the pastor the pastor the one who is a
[1:26:49] senior pastor must have theological
[1:26:51] training
[1:26:53] number three there are many many things
[1:26:55] there must be a dismember of the
[1:26:57] association or whatever
[1:26:59] and these requirements
[1:27:01] are all going to thin out the bride
[1:27:04] whereby you will find people and i'm
[1:27:06] telling you because most of you are
[1:27:08] young and you will say these things if
[1:27:09] the lord carries
[1:27:11] whereby
[1:27:12] pastors in the message will say it is
[1:27:15] okay no problem to register and be a
[1:27:17] member of
[1:27:18] you know the association of pastors what
[1:27:20] is wrong with it
[1:27:21] we still preach the message we still
[1:27:23] believe the message we still you know so
[1:27:25] what is wrong with it it seems as if
[1:27:27] there is nothing wrong with it but has
[1:27:28] already been prophesied but i'm
[1:27:30] prophesied about the the wildcats of
[1:27:32] churches before it even became the world
[1:27:34] cup of churches he prophesied that there
[1:27:36] will be one organization which will come
[1:27:38] up and all the denominations will join
[1:27:40] it and by joining it by subjoining it by
[1:27:43] so doing they receive the mark of the
[1:27:44] beast and he said all of them would join
[1:27:47] it and when it started the other side
[1:27:49] which are not judged
[1:27:50] but they joined it now
[1:27:52] so time will come when even so-called
[1:27:54] messenger preachers will do it
[1:27:56] we'll change such things we're going to
[1:27:57] to get bible purpose theological papers
[1:28:00] from those seminaries
[1:28:02] in order to continue preaching they say
[1:28:04] we want to continue preaching the
[1:28:06] message
[1:28:07] but actually the thing will not be that
[1:28:09] the thing will be they want to continue
[1:28:10] to be relevant and they want to continue
[1:28:13] receiving the money they want to
[1:28:14] continue because by that time they will
[1:28:16] have you know
[1:28:18] you know especially those pastors with
[1:28:19] very huge charges and you know getting
[1:28:22] bigger incomes you know it's very
[1:28:24] difficult to leave such a thing you feel
[1:28:25] like oh no surely good government
[1:28:33] you will see them starting
[1:28:35] ask yourself why is it not starting it
[1:28:38] now
[1:28:39] why are those bible colleges not
[1:28:40] starting right now in the message do we
[1:28:42] need them
[1:28:43] why have they not studied
[1:28:46] why does anyone know
[1:28:48] why
[1:28:51] because we believe that god calls a man
[1:28:55] god equips the man
[1:28:57] god fills the man with the holy ghost
[1:28:59] and the man goes to prison that's what
[1:29:00] we believe that's pentecostal that is
[1:29:03] apostolic
[1:29:05] but what is going to happen is
[1:29:08] time will come when the love of many
[1:29:09] shall work what is wrong
[1:29:11] what is your if they want their bible
[1:29:15] what is wrong with having a bible
[1:29:17] they will do a bible college it was
[1:29:19] center of the message yeah they were
[1:29:20] saying we are going to take the chat
[1:29:22] ages and we are going to teach you know
[1:29:24] we shall have our own curriculum in the
[1:29:26] church ages and then we shall have some
[1:29:29] it means that we have to have
[1:29:30] a man on the top right the one who is
[1:29:33] called the chancellor and then that man
[1:29:35] will have to be one of the pastors not
[1:29:36] so so then everybody will have to get a
[1:29:39] certificate from him
[1:29:41] don't deceive yourself you're already
[1:29:42] denomination also
[1:29:44] by the time you organize that way you
[1:29:46] already have become a denomination and
[1:29:48] there is no way you will survive the
[1:29:49] mark of the beast because you have to
[1:29:51] also join their associations
[1:29:54] hallelujah
[1:29:56] so friends
[1:29:57] what is it this we are living in a time
[1:30:00] that is prophesied to come
[1:30:02] we are living in prophetic times
[1:30:04] and we have to know what we believe each
[1:30:05] of you each of us have to know what we
[1:30:08] believe we have to stand for what we
[1:30:10] believe we have to fight for what we
[1:30:11] believe hallelujah amen at least someone
[1:30:14] young like he would say me i don't care
[1:30:16] about all the rest me i'm a believer as
[1:30:18] me we are not going to go to heaven as
[1:30:20] churches
[1:30:23] we are going to go to heaven as
[1:30:24] individuals
[1:30:26] the bible will not devour did not say
[1:30:28] that oh now the bunch of the believers
[1:30:30] will be in one place and then they will
[1:30:31] all be chained and raptured together
[1:30:33] they're going to meet the lord in the
[1:30:34] air they ask about the bottom
[1:30:37] is he should we gather in jackson or
[1:30:39] should we come in arizona or in
[1:30:41] jeffersonville should we should we
[1:30:43] shift and stay there because when the
[1:30:45] rapture comes we need to be ready he
[1:30:47] said no
[1:30:48] ah god has shown me a place where you
[1:30:50] should gather
[1:30:52] get my book hallelujah god has shown me
[1:30:54] a place where you should gather
[1:30:57] it was revealed to him by prophecy
[1:31:00] there is a song here i want to see if i
[1:31:02] if i i'll get that song
[1:31:06] by the beauty paul i really doubt
[1:31:07] whether you can play this song because
[1:31:09] it is quite a bit
[1:31:12] it's quite a bit hard but if i get it
[1:31:13] here in this big song brother brother
[1:31:16] charlo if you know the song number
[1:31:18] please help me
[1:31:20] please help me and say that song number
[1:31:22] it says that shall we gather something
[1:31:23] like that
[1:31:27] huh
[1:31:30] no no no not that one not that one you
[1:31:32] see
[1:31:33] people thought that they can gather in
[1:31:34] one place where the rapture will find
[1:31:36] them
[1:31:39] okay
[1:31:42] we
[1:31:50] okay
[1:31:52] i can't find it but it goes on that line
[1:31:56] shall we gather intact song
[1:32:00] oh in jeffersonville
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:04] say the bride
[1:32:06] asked a question you know something like
[1:32:08] that and said
[1:32:10] that said the lord has told me where you
[1:32:13] should gather
[1:32:15] just gather in christ the
[1:32:18] lord hallelujah
[1:32:20] that is why we should gather yes we
[1:32:22] should gather in christ
[1:32:35] and where is christ christ is here
[1:32:38] christ is in his word crisis in your
[1:32:40] heart christ hallelujah is everywhere
[1:32:43] among those that believe and fear his
[1:32:45] name hallelujah so time is coming where
[1:32:48] believers will try to make themselves
[1:32:50] our denomination
[1:32:52] well of course not believers but those
[1:32:54] who are
[1:32:55] the shack because the bible well
[1:32:57] abandoned preached a message and said
[1:32:58] they're shocked
[1:32:59] the bride will not be here
[1:33:01] with a shark
[1:33:03] yes
[1:33:03] so the witch cannot be here with the
[1:33:05] shark it has to be separated as much as
[1:33:07] you wrap your maize and you know your
[1:33:09] wrist cannot grow without the shark okay
[1:33:10] but when it grows up there you have to
[1:33:12] remove the shark
[1:33:13] and everything else throw it down in the
[1:33:15] fire and you take your meat so god is
[1:33:18] coming back for seed not the sun the
[1:33:20] sheep the seed will not be here with
[1:33:22] their shark
[1:33:24] so that would be the time when they were
[1:33:26] just gone organized just to continue to
[1:33:28] be to preach
[1:33:30] it looks sounds good and looks good we
[1:33:32] would have to continue preaching this
[1:33:34] for the fact that preaching
[1:33:35] you know people say
[1:33:37] people still need to get saved but by
[1:33:38] that time time is over
[1:33:40] racism over mass is over it's his time
[1:33:43] now to just come and collect his remnant
[1:33:45] to come and collect his bride
[1:33:52] do that work until he had received the
[1:33:54] gifts which would enable him to do the
[1:33:55] work
[1:33:56] he had to go out in the desert and wait
[1:33:58] there
[1:33:59] god had an appointed time
[1:34:02] there was to be a certain pharaoh on the
[1:34:03] throne
[1:34:04] and the people had to be crying for the
[1:34:06] bread of life before god could send him
[1:34:08] back
[1:34:09] this is true for our day
[1:34:11] but what do we have in this our day
[1:34:14] multitudes are working signs until we
[1:34:17] have a generation of sign seekers that
[1:34:19] know little or nothing about the word or
[1:34:21] a true move of the spirit of god
[1:34:24] if they see blood
[1:34:25] oil and fire they are happy it matters
[1:34:28] not what is in the word
[1:34:30] they will support any sign even on
[1:34:32] scriptural ones
[1:34:34] but god has warned us about that
[1:34:36] he said in matthew 24 that in the last
[1:34:39] days the two spirits would be so close
[1:34:41] together that only the very elect could
[1:34:43] tell them apart for they alone would not
[1:34:45] be deceived
[1:34:47] how can you tell the spirits apart
[1:34:50] just give them the word test
[1:34:52] if they don't speak that word they are
[1:34:54] of the evil one
[1:34:56] hallelujah
[1:34:57] i said hallelujah
[1:34:59] i said hallelujah
[1:35:01] give them a what
[1:35:04] now of course we have seen all through
[1:35:06] we believe in miracles we believe in
[1:35:08] sins and ones actually we talked about
[1:35:10] it too as the evil one deceived the
[1:35:12] first two brides the true bride of jesus
[1:35:14] christ
[1:35:16] the true church
[1:35:19] the first thing that we saw was what
[1:35:22] they had the pure word of god and then
[1:35:23] the second thing we saw was
[1:35:26] the manifestation of the power of god
[1:35:28] right yes through the gifts and there
[1:35:30] and all that now
[1:35:32] without that we know that sure that's
[1:35:34] not the true church but also we have
[1:35:36] seen that the signs will deep in plenty
[1:35:39] and it will even be impossible
[1:35:44] to differentiate
[1:35:46] which is which
[1:35:48] but there's only one group of people but
[1:35:50] it will not be deceived men
[1:35:52] and that group of people
[1:35:54] is the bride
[1:35:56] the rest
[1:35:57] make no mistake about it will be
[1:35:59] deceived
[1:36:01] yeah but that church is good they will
[1:36:03] be deceived
[1:36:06] but they also dress almost like us
[1:36:07] they'll be deceived
[1:36:10] only the bride
[1:36:11] will not be
[1:36:12] deceived before it is impossible to
[1:36:14] receive the elect yes
[1:36:17] and this speech will be so close
[1:36:19] you remember the other man that brother
[1:36:21] banham saw in a vision after he had they
[1:36:24] interviewed them after the anointing had
[1:36:26] come down one was speaking in tongues
[1:36:28] another one was interpreting and then he
[1:36:30] interviewed them each of them as we were
[1:36:32] speaking to each of them and so one was
[1:36:33] the
[1:36:34] pagan almost another other believer
[1:36:36] you know but today what are we going to
[1:36:39] do we don't have a gift like that
[1:36:40] right each of us but what we can do is
[1:36:42] we have a way we can also design those
[1:36:44] scripts we give them our wordpress
[1:36:48] so if someone claims to be a believer
[1:36:50] give them a what
[1:36:53] i want to put their lives through the
[1:36:54] world test them by the world just take
[1:36:57] that by the word hallelujah
[1:36:59] is it in order is it according to the
[1:37:02] word
[1:37:03] huh
[1:37:04] let it be
[1:37:05] he will try to deceive the bride of this
[1:37:07] last day by trying to get her to
[1:37:09] hybridize herself through creeds or just
[1:37:12] plainly turning from the word to any
[1:37:14] sign that suits her
[1:37:16] but god never placed signs ahead of the
[1:37:18] word signs follow the word as when
[1:37:21] elijah told the woman to bake a cake for
[1:37:23] him first according to the word of the
[1:37:25] lord
[1:37:26] when she did as the word said the proper
[1:37:29] sign came
[1:37:31] come to the word first and then watch
[1:37:33] the miracle the seed word is energized
[1:37:36] by the spirit
[1:37:38] how can any messenger sent from god
[1:37:40] believe only a part of the word and deny
[1:37:42] some of it
[1:37:43] the true prophet of god in this last day
[1:37:45] will proclaim the whole word
[1:37:48] denominations will hate him his words
[1:37:50] may be as harsh as john the baptist who
[1:37:52] called them vipers
[1:37:54] but the predestinated will hear and be
[1:37:56] ready for the rapture
[1:37:58] the royal seed of abraham with like
[1:38:00] faith as abraham's will hold to the word
[1:38:02] with him for they are predestinated
[1:38:04] together
[1:38:07] the last day messenger will appear in
[1:38:09] god's appointed time
[1:38:11] it is the end time now as all know for
[1:38:13] israel is in the homeland
[1:38:15] anytime now he will come according to
[1:38:17] malachi
[1:38:18] when we see him he will be dedicated to
[1:38:20] the word
[1:38:21] he will be indicated pointed out in the
[1:38:24] word revelations 10 7
[1:38:26] and god will vindicate his ministry
[1:38:29] he will preach the truth as did elijah
[1:38:31] and be ready for the mount zion showdown
[1:38:34] many will misunderstand him because they
[1:38:36] have been taught scripture in a certain
[1:38:38] way which they consider truth
[1:38:40] when he comes against that they will not
[1:38:42] believe
[1:38:43] even some true ministers will
[1:38:45] misunderstand the messenger because so
[1:38:46] much has been called god's truth by
[1:38:48] deceivers
[1:38:50] but this prophet will come and as the
[1:38:52] forerunner to the first coming cried
[1:38:55] behold the lamb of god that taketh away
[1:38:57] the sin of the world
[1:38:59] even so will he no doubt cry out
[1:39:01] behold the lamb of god coming in glory
[1:39:04] he will do this for even as john was the
[1:39:06] messenger of truth to the elect so is
[1:39:09] this one the last messenger to the elect
[1:39:11] and word born bride
[1:39:15] christ eulogizes the church
[1:39:18] revelation 2 13
[1:39:21] i know thy works and where thou dwellest
[1:39:24] even where satan's seat is and thou
[1:39:26] holdest fast my name and has not denied
[1:39:29] my faith even in those days wherein
[1:39:31] antipas was my faithful martyr who was
[1:39:33] slain among you where satan dwelleth
[1:39:37] i know thy works
[1:39:39] these are the identical words uttered to
[1:39:41] each of the seven messengers relative to
[1:39:43] the people of god in each age
[1:39:46] as they are spoken to the two vines true
[1:39:48] and false
[1:39:49] they will bring joy and gladness to the
[1:39:51] hearts of one group but they ought to
[1:39:53] strike terror in the hearts of the other
[1:39:55] for though we are saved by grace apart
[1:39:58] from works true salvation will bring
[1:40:00] forth works or deeds that will please
[1:40:02] god
[1:40:03] first john 3 7
[1:40:06] little children let no man deceive you
[1:40:08] he that doeth worketh righteousness is
[1:40:11] righteous even as he is righteous
[1:40:15] if this verse means anything at all it
[1:40:16] means that what a man does he is
[1:40:19] james 3 11
[1:40:22] dot the fountain sent forth at the same
[1:40:24] place sweet water and bitter
[1:40:26] romans 6 2
[1:40:29] how shall we that are dead to sin live
[1:40:31] any longer therein
[1:40:33] matthew 12 33-35
[1:40:36] either make the tree good and his fruit
[1:40:38] good or else make the tree corrupt and
[1:40:40] his fruit corrupt for the tree is known
[1:40:43] by his fruit
[1:40:44] o generation of vipers how can ye being
[1:40:47] evil speak good things for out of the
[1:40:49] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:40:51] speaketh a good man out of the good
[1:40:53] treasure of the heart bringeth forth
[1:40:55] good things and an evil man out of the
[1:40:57] evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
[1:41:00] now if a man is born of the word
[1:41:02] being born again not of corruptable seed
[1:41:05] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[1:41:07] which liveth and abideth forever
[1:41:09] first peter 1 23
[1:41:12] he will produce the word
[1:41:15] the fruit or works of his life will be a
[1:41:17] product of the kind of seed of life that
[1:41:18] is in him
[1:41:20] his works therefore will be scriptural
[1:41:22] oh what an indictment this truth is
[1:41:24] going to be against the pergamian age
[1:41:27] there stands that matchless one and in
[1:41:29] his hand the sharp sword with the two
[1:41:31] edges the word of god
[1:41:34] and that word will judge us in the last
[1:41:36] day
[1:41:37] in fact the word is judging even now for
[1:41:39] it is the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:41:41] intents of the heart
[1:41:43] it cuts us under the carnal from the
[1:41:44] spiritual it makes us living epistles
[1:41:47] read and known of all men to the glory
[1:41:49] of god
[1:41:51] i know thy works
[1:41:53] if a man fears that he might not please
[1:41:55] god then let him fulfill the word
[1:41:58] if a man wonders if he will hear those
[1:42:00] words
[1:42:00] well done good and faithful servant
[1:42:03] let him fulfill the word of god in his
[1:42:05] life and assuredly he will hear those
[1:42:07] words of praise
[1:42:09] the word of truth was the criterion then
[1:42:12] it is the criterion now there isn't
[1:42:14] another standard there isn't another
[1:42:16] plumb line
[1:42:18] as the world is going to be judged by
[1:42:20] one christ jesus even so it is going to
[1:42:22] be judged by the word
[1:42:24] if a man wants to know how he is making
[1:42:26] out let him do as james suggested
[1:42:29] look into the mirror of god's word
[1:42:32] i know thy works
[1:42:34] as he stood there with the word
[1:42:36] examining their lives and the light of
[1:42:38] the blueprint he had laid out for them
[1:42:40] he must have been pleased in a goodly
[1:42:41] measure
[1:42:42] for they like the others who had gone on
[1:42:44] before were enduring the persecution of
[1:42:46] the unjust and still joyfully cleaving
[1:42:49] unto the lord
[1:42:51] okay so
[1:42:53] we're going to skip here
[1:42:55] and go and go to
[1:42:59] where he says that doesn't denied
[1:43:02] my faith
[1:43:04] um
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:08] in acts 3 16
[1:43:11] when peter was asked how the mighty
[1:43:12] miracle had taken place upon the
[1:43:14] crippled one at the gate beautiful
[1:43:16] he explained it on this wise
[1:43:19] and his jesus name through faith in his
[1:43:22] jesus name have made this man former
[1:43:25] strong
[1:43:27] yea the faith which is by from him jesus
[1:43:31] hath given him the man
[1:43:33] this perfect soundness in the presence
[1:43:35] of you all
[1:43:37] see there it is
[1:43:39] jesus name and jesus faith brought about
[1:43:41] the miracle
[1:43:42] peter did not claim it was his own human
[1:43:44] faith any more than he claimed that it
[1:43:46] was his own name
[1:43:48] he's
[1:43:49] how many things brought forth the
[1:43:51] miracle
[1:43:54] come on
[1:43:56] so what is in which
[1:44:02] right here
[1:44:03] and it's jesus
[1:44:05] and his name meaning jesus name
[1:44:09] through
[1:44:10] faith in his name
[1:44:12] has made this man from a strong
[1:44:17] and by the ban and then submerges that
[1:44:18] to say
[1:44:20] see here it is
[1:44:22] jesus name and jesus faith wrote about
[1:44:27] the miracle
[1:44:29] amen
[1:44:30] it's not your intellectual conception of
[1:44:32] the word that brings forth the miracle
[1:44:35] it is your faith in christ
[1:44:38] it's your faith in jesus christ and it
[1:44:40] is the name of jesus christ
[1:44:43] two things
[1:44:44] did you know the name of jesus has power
[1:44:46] yes how many know that
[1:44:48] the name of jesus has power
[1:44:50] you know so let me tell you the name of
[1:44:52] jesus has power never ever use his name
[1:44:56] in vain
[1:44:57] some people sometimes say jesus
[1:45:00] oh jesus
[1:45:02] please
[1:45:04] stop using that name like that
[1:45:08] it's true
[1:45:09] that is
[1:45:11] like you know almost like cassie
[1:45:14] some of you think that it makes you more
[1:45:15] spiritual it is bad
[1:45:19] it's bad
[1:45:21] for example here in uganda here in
[1:45:23] uganda we have a king
[1:45:25] his name is
[1:45:28] donald
[1:45:32] i'm sure he's already offended
[1:45:34] how dare he call the name of my king
[1:45:36] like that
[1:45:38] if i go on tv like and i say yeah like
[1:45:41] uh
[1:45:42] mr ronaldo
[1:45:52] our king like that
[1:45:54] they want me to call him his other names
[1:45:57] his other titles that makes his name so
[1:46:00] huge and so big and so far
[1:46:02] lion
[1:46:06] they have other men named
[1:46:10] eh
[1:46:25] all sorts of names martin why are you
[1:46:27] quiet give us those names
[1:46:33] yes
[1:46:34] he has many names right
[1:46:37] very many names i'm sorry if i offended
[1:46:39] the brother but i'm sure you're in
[1:46:40] another family now
[1:46:42] so
[1:46:43] even our jesus we shouldn't just recall
[1:46:46] that name without a reason a cause
[1:46:49] it has been to an accident even when we
[1:46:51] go for prayer maybe pray for a sick
[1:46:53] person they don't get well because they
[1:46:56] don't have faith in that name anymore
[1:46:58] how can you have faith
[1:47:01] if you know that the name is so powerful
[1:47:02] when it is mentioned
[1:47:04] something happens but if you just use it
[1:47:07] every every anyhow that you want
[1:47:09] time comes when you call when you speak
[1:47:11] it doesn't make any more sense it
[1:47:13] doesn't it doesn't bring faith
[1:47:15] it doesn't click it doesn't raise faith
[1:47:17] in you then the ministers become so
[1:47:20] common to you
[1:47:21] at this time that name by the way was
[1:47:24] rejected by the denominations
[1:47:27] they would arrest the believers and send
[1:47:29] them and they said but
[1:47:31] as you are going
[1:47:32] make sure you don't speak that name
[1:47:34] again because that name threatened
[1:47:37] the establishment at that time
[1:47:39] they thought maybe because there was
[1:47:41] many many stories about that name
[1:47:43] jesus is not dead and i said no he rose
[1:47:45] we saw him they tried as much as
[1:47:48] possible to suppress that thing that he
[1:47:50] he rose
[1:47:51] they even
[1:47:52] had some people there to say no you know
[1:47:54] he actually the disciples came and stole
[1:47:56] him from there how can they steal
[1:47:58] someone who has been in a place where
[1:47:59] there is even a roman ceremony
[1:48:02] impossible
[1:48:03] it was the angel michael who came and
[1:48:05] removed the stone
[1:48:06] and the christ came out of the grave
[1:48:09] hallelujah that presence removed the
[1:48:11] stone it was christ to remove the stone
[1:48:14] but they thought that
[1:48:17] if that name will be spoken
[1:48:19] people will continue becoming fanatics
[1:48:22] believing and following up a a man they
[1:48:24] don't even know exists
[1:48:26] and if they follow him and they have all
[1:48:27] their allegiance to him maybe our king
[1:48:30] may you know that time when you
[1:48:31] mentioned the head of herod everybody
[1:48:33] would shake
[1:48:34] so they did not want another name which
[1:48:36] is bigger than the name of the kingdom
[1:48:38] of that plane
[1:48:39] but that name is still more powerful
[1:48:41] even today
[1:48:43] that name is more powerful than any name
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:49] the president of the most greatest
[1:48:52] country that you know oh
[1:48:53] that name is more powerful that name is
[1:48:55] even powerful more powerful than any
[1:48:57] name that you know of called cancer
[1:48:59] called malaria called a typhoid called
[1:49:01] all those diseases right those are names
[1:49:03] coronavirus his name jesus is more
[1:49:06] powerful
[1:49:08] at the mention of the name of jesus can
[1:49:10] you hear that yes affirmation of the
[1:49:12] name of
[1:49:19] shall confess
[1:49:21] that jesus christ is lord so tell for
[1:49:24] that name is a powerful name and if you
[1:49:26] have ever if you will ever be prayed for
[1:49:29] someone touch you and pray
[1:49:31] and sanction that name is not simply
[1:49:33] speaking
[1:49:34] he is calling upon everything that is
[1:49:37] behind that name
[1:49:38] and let me tell you all the bank of
[1:49:40] heaven
[1:49:54] so
[1:50:09] the other says we cannot get salvation
[1:50:10] in any other name but in the name of
[1:50:13] jesus christ because that name of jesus
[1:50:15] is a powerful name hallelujah amen let
[1:50:18] me tell you someone can come to attack
[1:50:19] me and i simply speak jesus and the
[1:50:21] person can fall down that's her
[1:50:26] you people believe it if you don't
[1:50:27] believe it you're not christians
[1:50:30] that's what makes us christians they say
[1:50:31] that they have faith in the name and
[1:50:34] also
[1:50:35] they have they have
[1:50:37] faith in
[1:50:38] jesus
[1:50:39] hallelujah
[1:50:42] in his name
[1:50:44] and in him hallelujah it is now
[1:50:47] and in him
[1:50:49] in his
[1:50:50] name and in him well of course you have
[1:50:52] to have faith in him but not in him
[1:50:55] alone also in his name yes hallelujah
[1:50:58] because his name is powerful whatever
[1:51:00] condition is troubling you are rebuking
[1:51:02] that name use that man hallelujah say
[1:51:05] the name of jesus
[1:51:06] i denounced my life
[1:51:08] i command you out never in the name of
[1:51:10] jesus he will go
[1:51:12] when the conscience of evil have been
[1:51:14] using that darkness better than
[1:51:15] believers
[1:51:17] because they are trained to believe
[1:51:19] and and believers are still just
[1:51:20] meandering around
[1:51:23] believing in their pastors more than the
[1:51:24] name
[1:51:26] it's good to have a pastor to respect
[1:51:27] him as a man of god the bible says if
[1:51:29] you are sick you go there you know pray
[1:51:31] for you but he's going to pray for you
[1:51:33] in that name
[1:51:35] that name is powerful
[1:51:37] that if i have faith in things that's up
[1:51:39] to you but here is what he's saying have
[1:51:41] faith in that name
[1:51:43] and in him the person
[1:51:46] oh my i can preach about this for two
[1:51:48] hours this is so powerful and so rich
[1:51:50] the name of jesus
[1:51:57] said that jesus name used in the faith
[1:51:59] which is from jesus performed that great
[1:52:01] work
[1:52:02] this faith is what the lord was speaking
[1:52:04] about in revelation 2 13.
[1:52:07] it was his faith
[1:52:09] it was not faith in him
[1:52:11] but it was his own faith that he had
[1:52:14] given to the believers
[1:52:16] romans 12 3
[1:52:18] according as god hath dealt to every man
[1:52:21] according to verse 1 the men are
[1:52:23] brethren the measure of faith
[1:52:26] ephesians 2 8
[1:52:28] by grace are you saved through faith and
[1:52:30] that faith not of yourself
[1:52:33] it is a gift of god
[1:52:35] and it also says in james 2 1
[1:52:38] my brethren notice he too is talking to
[1:52:41] brethren
[1:52:42] have not the faith of not in our lord
[1:52:45] jesus christ with respect of persons
[1:52:49] in this pergamine age where men were
[1:52:51] humanizing salvation having turned from
[1:52:53] the truth that salvation is of the lord
[1:52:56] having cast aside the doctrine of
[1:52:58] election and opened wide the church door
[1:53:00] and their fellowship to any and all who
[1:53:02] subscribe to their tenants never mind
[1:53:04] the word
[1:53:05] in this age of rapid degradation
[1:53:08] there were still the few who had the
[1:53:10] measure of that faith of our lord jesus
[1:53:12] christ
[1:53:13] and not only used that faith in acts of
[1:53:15] power but withstood those who dared to
[1:53:17] say that they were saved simply on the
[1:53:19] grounds of joining a church
[1:53:22] they knew that no man could truly
[1:53:23] believe unto eternal life and the
[1:53:25] righteousness of god apart from the
[1:53:27] measure of the faith of the lord jesus
[1:53:29] himself
[1:53:31] as today's church is filled with mental
[1:53:32] believers who endorse the virgin birth
[1:53:35] the shed blood
[1:53:36] going to church and taking communion and
[1:53:39] are not reborn at all
[1:53:40] even so in that third age was the same
[1:53:42] problem
[1:53:44] human faith wasn't enough then and it is
[1:53:46] not enough now
[1:53:47] it takes the very faith of the son of
[1:53:49] god to drop into a man's heart so that
[1:53:52] he can receive the lord of glory into
[1:53:54] the temple not made with hands
[1:53:57] this was a living faith
[1:53:59] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:54:02] paul did not say that he lived by faith
[1:54:04] in the son of god
[1:54:06] it was the faith of the son of god that
[1:54:08] had given him life and kept him living
[1:54:10] in christian victory
[1:54:12] no they had not denied that salvation
[1:54:14] was supernatural from start to finish
[1:54:17] they kept alive the truth of his name
[1:54:19] and his faith and they were blessed by
[1:54:21] the lord and accounted worthy of him
[1:54:26] and to pass my faithful martyr
[1:54:29] there is no other record in the word or
[1:54:31] in any profane history concerning this
[1:54:33] brother
[1:54:34] but surely there need not be
[1:54:36] it is more than enough that he was for
[1:54:38] known and known of the lord
[1:54:40] it is more than enough to see his
[1:54:41] faithfulness unto the lord recorded in
[1:54:43] the living word
[1:54:45] he was a christian
[1:54:46] he had the name of jesus
[1:54:49] he had the faith of our lord jesus
[1:54:50] christ and he was amongst those who
[1:54:52] lived by it
[1:54:53] he had responded to the words of james
[1:54:56] have not the faith of our lord jesus
[1:54:58] christ with respect of persons
[1:55:00] full of the holy ghost and faith as was
[1:55:02] stephen he respected no one he feared no
[1:55:05] one and when death was pronounced upon
[1:55:08] all who would take that name and walk in
[1:55:10] the faith of jesus christ he took his
[1:55:12] stand with those who would not turn back
[1:55:15] yes he died but like abel
[1:55:17] he obtained a witness from god
[1:55:19] his name is written in the word
[1:55:21] and though dead his voice still speaks
[1:55:24] in the pages of god's divine record
[1:55:27] another faithful martyr was carried to
[1:55:28] his rest
[1:55:30] but satan did not triumph then even as
[1:55:32] he did not triumph when he killed the
[1:55:33] prince of peace for as satan was
[1:55:36] despoiled at the cross
[1:55:37] even so now will the blood of antipas
[1:55:39] cry out to hundreds more who will take
[1:55:41] up their crosses and follow him
[1:55:45] where satan's seat is
[1:55:48] the reason that this is part of the
[1:55:49] eulogy of the spirit is because these
[1:55:51] brave soldiers of the cross were
[1:55:53] overcoming satan right in the midst of
[1:55:55] his own throne room
[1:55:56] they were winning the battle through the
[1:55:58] name and faith of jesus right in the
[1:56:00] camp of the leaders of darkness
[1:56:02] what a tremendous commendation
[1:56:04] like the mighty men of david who invaded
[1:56:06] the camp of the enemy to bring david
[1:56:08] thirst quenching water
[1:56:09] so these giants of faith invaded the
[1:56:12] realm of satan's earthly stronghold
[1:56:14] and by preaching and exhorting brought
[1:56:16] the water of salvation to those who
[1:56:18] lived under the shadow of death
[1:56:21] now as much as these words concerning
[1:56:23] the throne and realm of satan are a part
[1:56:25] of god's praise for his elect
[1:56:27] they actually set the stage for the
[1:56:29] denouncement of the evil that has gained
[1:56:31] supremacy in the church
[1:56:33] pergamus
[1:56:35] satan's throne and dwelling place
[1:56:38] to many these phrases have been merely
[1:56:40] pictorial rather than truly historical
[1:56:42] but they are surely real and history
[1:56:44] bears that out
[1:56:46] pergamos was indeed the throne and
[1:56:48] dwelling place of satan
[1:56:50] it happened on this wise
[1:56:52] pergamos was not originally the place
[1:56:54] where satan as concerning human affairs
[1:56:56] dwelt
[1:56:57] babylon has always been literally and
[1:56:59] figuratively his headquarters
[1:57:01] it was in the city of babylon that
[1:57:03] satanic worship had its origin
[1:57:05] genesis 10 8-10
[1:57:08] and cush begat nimrod he began to be a
[1:57:11] mighty one in the earth
[1:57:13] he was a mighty hunter before the lord
[1:57:15] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[1:57:16] babel and iraq and akhad and kauna in
[1:57:20] the land of shiner
[1:57:22] genesis 11 1-9
[1:57:25] and the whole earth was of one language
[1:57:27] and of one speech
[1:57:29] and it came to pass as they journeyed
[1:57:30] from the east that they found a plane in
[1:57:32] the land of shiner and they dwelt there
[1:57:35] and they said one to another go to let
[1:57:38] us make brick and burn them thoroughly
[1:57:41] and they had brick for stone and slime
[1:57:43] they had for mortar
[1:57:44] and they said
[1:57:46] go to let us build us a city and a tower
[1:57:48] whose top may reach unto heaven and let
[1:57:50] us make us a name lest we be scattered
[1:57:52] abroad upon the face of the whole earth
[1:57:56] and the lord came down to see the city
[1:57:58] and the tower which the children of men
[1:58:00] builded
[1:58:01] and the lord said
[1:58:02] behold the people is one and they have
[1:58:05] all one language and this they begin to
[1:58:07] do and now nothing will be restrained
[1:58:10] from them which they have imagined to do
[1:58:13] go to let us go down and there confound
[1:58:15] their language but they may not
[1:58:17] understand one another's speech so the
[1:58:20] lord scattered them abroad from thence
[1:58:21] upon the face of all the earth
[1:58:24] and they left off to build the city
[1:58:26] therefore is the name of it called babel
[1:58:28] because the lord did there confound the
[1:58:30] language of all the earth
[1:58:32] and from thence did the lord scatter
[1:58:34] them abroad upon the face of all the
[1:58:36] earth
[1:58:37] babel is the original name for babylon
[1:58:40] it means confusion
[1:58:42] it was literally started by cush the son
[1:58:44] of ham but was brought to a kingdom of
[1:58:46] power and grandeur under his son nimrod
[1:58:49] the mighty hunter
[1:58:50] nimrod according to the genesis 11
[1:58:52] account and also according to profane
[1:58:54] history set out to accomplish three
[1:58:56] things he wanted to build a strong
[1:58:58] nation which he did he wanted to
[1:59:00] propagate his own religion which he did
[1:59:03] he wanted to make a name for himself
[1:59:05] which he also accomplished
[1:59:07] his accomplishments were so monumental
[1:59:09] that the kingdom of babylon was called
[1:59:10] the head of gold amongst all world
[1:59:12] governments
[1:59:14] that his religion gained prominence is
[1:59:16] proven by the fact that scripture
[1:59:18] identifies it with satan completely in
[1:59:20] isaiah chapter 14 and in revelation
[1:59:22] chapter 17 through 18.
[1:59:25] and by history we can prove that it
[1:59:27] invaded the whole world and is the basis
[1:59:29] for every system of idolatry and the
[1:59:31] theme of mythology though the names of
[1:59:33] the gods differ in various sections of
[1:59:35] the land according to the language of
[1:59:37] the people
[1:59:38] that he made a name for himself and his
[1:59:39] followers goes without saying
[1:59:41] for as long as this present age goes on
[1:59:44] until jesus reveals himself to his
[1:59:45] brethren he will be worshipped and
[1:59:47] honored though under a different name
[1:59:49] from nimrod and in a temple slightly
[1:59:52] different from the one in which he was
[1:59:53] originally adored
[1:59:55] since the bible does not deal in the
[1:59:56] histories of other nations in detail it
[1:59:59] will be necessary to search the ancient
[2:00:00] profane records to find our answer as to
[2:00:03] how pergamos became the seat of the
[2:00:04] satanic religion of babylon
[2:00:07] the major sources of information will be
[2:00:09] in records of egyptian and grecian
[2:00:11] culture
[2:00:12] the reason for this is that egypt
[2:00:14] received her science and mathematics
[2:00:16] from the chaldeans and in turn greece
[2:00:18] received them from egypt
[2:00:20] now since the priests were in charge of
[2:00:22] teaching these sciences and since these
[2:00:24] sciences were used as a part of religion
[2:00:26] we already know the key as to how the
[2:00:28] babylonish religion gained its strength
[2:00:30] in these two countries
[2:00:32] it is also true that whenever a nation
[2:00:34] was able to overcome another nation in
[2:00:36] due time the religion of the subduer
[2:00:38] became the religion of the subdued
[2:00:40] it is well known that the greeks had the
[2:00:42] very same signs of the zodiac as did the
[2:00:44] babylonians and it has been found in the
[2:00:47] ancient egyptian records that the
[2:00:48] egyptians gave the greeks their
[2:00:50] knowledge of polytheism
[2:00:52] thus the mysteries of babylon spread
[2:00:54] from nation to nation until it appeared
[2:00:55] in rome in china india and even in both
[2:00:59] north and south america we find the very
[2:01:01] same basic worship
[2:01:03] the ancient histories agree with the
[2:01:05] bible that this babylonish religion was
[2:01:07] most certainly not the original religion
[2:01:09] of earth's early peoples
[2:01:11] it was the first to drift away from the
[2:01:13] original faith
[2:01:14] but it was not itself the original one
[2:01:17] historians such as wilkinson and mallet
[2:01:20] have proven conclusively from the
[2:01:21] ancient documents that at one time all
[2:01:24] the peoples of the earth believed in one
[2:01:26] god supreme eternal invisible
[2:01:29] who by the word of his mouth spoke all
[2:01:31] things into existence
[2:01:33] and that in his character he was loving
[2:01:35] and good and just but as satan will
[2:01:38] always corrupt whatever he can
[2:01:40] we find him corrupting the minds and
[2:01:42] hearts of men so that they reject the
[2:01:44] truth
[2:01:45] as he has always attempted to receive
[2:01:47] worship as though he were god and not
[2:01:49] the servant and creation of god he drew
[2:01:51] worship away from god to the end that he
[2:01:54] might draw it unto himself and so be
[2:01:56] exalted
[2:01:57] he certainly did accomplish his desire
[2:01:59] to spread his religion throughout the
[2:02:00] whole world
[2:02:02] this is authenticated by god in the book
[2:02:04] of romans
[2:02:05] when they knew god they glorified him
[2:02:08] not as god until they became vain in
[2:02:10] their imaginations and through darkness
[2:02:12] of heart accepted a corrupted religion
[2:02:14] to the extent that they worshipped
[2:02:16] creatures and not the creator
[2:02:18] remember satan was a creature of god son
[2:02:21] of the morning
[2:02:22] thus we find that where once truth was
[2:02:25] disseminated amongst men and all hell to
[2:02:28] that one truth there later came a day
[2:02:30] when a vast group turned from god and
[2:02:32] spread a diabolical form of worship
[2:02:34] around the world
[2:02:36] history bears it out that those of the
[2:02:38] tribe of shem that stood with the
[2:02:39] unchanging truth were in solid
[2:02:41] opposition to those of ham who turned
[2:02:43] away from truth to the devil's lie
[2:02:46] there is no time to engage in a
[2:02:48] discussion of this it is merely
[2:02:49] introduced that you may see there were
[2:02:51] two religions and two only and the evil
[2:02:53] one became worldwide
[2:02:56] monotheism turned to polytheism in
[2:02:58] babylon
[2:02:59] the devil's lie and the devil's
[2:03:01] mysteries rose up against the truth of
[2:03:03] god and the mysteries of god in that
[2:03:04] city
[2:03:05] satan truly became the god of this world
[2:03:07] and exacted worship from those that he
[2:03:09] had duped causing them to believe that
[2:03:12] he was truly the lord
[2:03:14] the polytheistic religion of the enemy
[2:03:16] began with the trinitarian doctrine
[2:03:18] it was way back there in antiquity that
[2:03:20] the
[2:03:21] one god in three persons idea came into
[2:03:23] existence
[2:03:25] how strange that our modern theologians
[2:03:26] have not spotted this but evidently just
[2:03:29] as duped by satan as their forebears
[2:03:31] were they still believe in three persons
[2:03:33] in the godhead
[2:03:35] let us be shown just one place in
[2:03:37] scripture where there is any authority
[2:03:39] for that doctrine
[2:03:40] is it not strange that while the
[2:03:42] descendants of ham went on their way in
[2:03:44] satanic worship which involved a basic
[2:03:46] concept of three gods that there is not
[2:03:49] one trace of the descendants of shem
[2:03:51] believing such a thing or having any
[2:03:53] ceremonial worship that involved even a
[2:03:55] type of it
[2:03:56] it is not strange that the hebrews
[2:03:58] believed
[2:03:59] hero israel the lord thy god is one god
[2:04:03] if there were three persons in the
[2:04:04] godhead
[2:04:05] abraham the descendant of shem in
[2:04:07] genesis 18 saw only one god with two
[2:04:10] angels
[2:04:12] now how was this trinity expressed
[2:04:14] it was expressed by an equilateral
[2:04:16] triangle even as it is expressed in rome
[2:04:18] today
[2:04:20] strange the hebrews did not have such a
[2:04:21] concept
[2:04:22] now who is right
[2:04:24] is it the hebrews or the babylonians
[2:04:26] in asia the polytheistic idea of three
[2:04:29] gods in one came out in an image with
[2:04:31] three heads on one body
[2:04:33] he is expressed as three intelligences
[2:04:35] in india they it in their hearts to
[2:04:38] express him as one god in three forms
[2:04:40] now that really is good modern day
[2:04:42] theology
[2:04:43] in japan there is a great buddha with
[2:04:45] three heads like the one we previously
[2:04:47] described
[2:04:48] but the most revealing of all is that
[2:04:50] which sets forth the trinitarian concept
[2:04:52] of god in a triune form of
[2:04:55] one
[2:04:56] the head of an old man symbolizing god
[2:04:58] the father
[2:04:59] two
[2:05:00] a circle which in the mysteries
[2:05:02] signified seed which in turn means the
[2:05:04] sun three
[2:05:07] the wings and tail of a bird dove
[2:05:10] here was the doctrine of father son and
[2:05:13] holy ghost
[2:05:14] three persons in the godhead the
[2:05:16] veritable trinity
[2:05:17] you can see the same thing in rome now
[2:05:20] let me ask once again
[2:05:22] is it not strange that the devil and his
[2:05:23] worshipers actually had more truth
[2:05:25] revealed than the father of faith
[2:05:27] abraham and his descendants
[2:05:30] is it not strange that the worshipers of
[2:05:31] satan knew more about god than the
[2:05:33] children of god
[2:05:35] now that is what modern theologians try
[2:05:37] to tell us when they talk about a
[2:05:38] trinity
[2:05:39] just remember this one thing from now on
[2:05:42] these records are facts and this is a
[2:05:44] fact
[2:05:45] satan is a liar and the father of lies
[2:05:48] and whenever he comes with any light it
[2:05:50] is still a lie he is a murderer
[2:05:53] and his doctrine of the trinity has
[2:05:54] destroyed the multitudes and will
[2:05:56] destroy until jesus comes
[2:06:00] according to history it did not take
[2:06:01] long for a change to be made in this
[2:06:03] concept of a father and a son and the
[2:06:05] holy ghost
[2:06:06] satan took them a step at a time away
[2:06:08] from the truth
[2:06:10] the evolved concept of deity was now
[2:06:12] one
[2:06:13] the eternal father
[2:06:15] to the spirit of god incarnate in a
[2:06:17] human mother
[2:06:19] does that make you think
[2:06:21] three
[2:06:22] a divine son the fruit of that
[2:06:24] incarnation woman's seed
[2:06:27] but the devil is not content he hasn't
[2:06:30] achieved worship of himself yet except
[2:06:32] in an indirect way
[2:06:34] so he takes the people away from the
[2:06:36] truth still further
[2:06:37] through his mysteries he reveals to the
[2:06:39] people that since the great invisible
[2:06:41] father god does not concern himself in
[2:06:43] the affairs of men
[2:06:45] but remain silent relative to them then
[2:06:47] it follows that he may well be
[2:06:49] worshipped in silence
[2:06:51] actually it means to ignore him as much
[2:06:52] as possible if not altogether
[2:06:55] this doctrine spread around the world
[2:06:57] also and right today in india you can
[2:06:59] see that temples to the great creator
[2:07:01] the silent god are strikingly few in
[2:07:03] number
[2:07:05] since it was not necessary to worship
[2:07:06] the creator father it was only natural
[2:07:09] that worship swung to the mother and
[2:07:11] child as the objects of adoration
[2:07:14] in egypt there was the same combination
[2:07:16] of mother and son called isis and osiris
[2:07:19] in india it was ishai and ishwara
[2:07:21] note the similarity of names even
[2:07:24] in asia it was civilly and the oes
[2:07:27] in rome and in greece it followed suit
[2:07:29] and in china
[2:07:30] well imagine the surprise of some roman
[2:07:32] catholic missionaries as they entered
[2:07:34] china and found their a madonna and
[2:07:36] child with rays of light emanating from
[2:07:38] the head of the babe the image could
[2:07:40] well have been exchanged for one in the
[2:07:42] vatican except for the difference of
[2:07:43] certain facial features
[2:07:46] it now behooves us to discover the
[2:07:48] original mother and child
[2:07:50] the original goddess mother of babylon
[2:07:52] was samiramus who was called rhea in the
[2:07:54] eastern countries
[2:07:56] in her arms she held a son who though a
[2:07:58] babe was described as tall strong
[2:08:00] handsome and especially captivating to
[2:08:02] the women
[2:08:03] in ezekiel 8 14 he was called tamus
[2:08:07] among classical writers he was called
[2:08:09] bacchus
[2:08:10] to the babylonians he was ninus
[2:08:13] what accounts for the fact that he is
[2:08:14] represented as a babe in arms and yet
[2:08:17] described as a great and mighty man is
[2:08:19] that he is known as the husband son
[2:08:22] one of his titles was husband of the
[2:08:24] mother and in india where the two are
[2:08:26] known as ishwara and ishai he the
[2:08:29] husband is represented as the babe at
[2:08:32] the breast of his own wife
[2:08:34] that this ninus is the nimrod of the
[2:08:36] bible we can affirm by comparing history
[2:08:38] with the genesis account
[2:08:40] pompeo said
[2:08:42] nina's king of assyria changed the
[2:08:44] ancient moderate ways of life by the
[2:08:46] desire for conquest
[2:08:48] he was the first who carried war against
[2:08:50] his neighbors
[2:08:52] he conquered all nations from assyria to
[2:08:54] libya as these men knew not the arts of
[2:08:56] war
[2:08:57] diadorus says
[2:08:59] ninas was the most ancient of assyrian
[2:09:01] kings mentioned in history
[2:09:03] being of warlike disposition he trained
[2:09:05] many young men rigorously in the arts of
[2:09:07] war he brought babylonia under him while
[2:09:10] yet there was no city of babylon
[2:09:12] thus we see this niners started to
[2:09:14] become great in babylon built babel and
[2:09:17] took over assyria becoming its king
[2:09:19] and then proceeded to devour other vast
[2:09:21] territories where the people were
[2:09:23] unskilled in war and lived in a moderate
[2:09:25] way as said pompeus
[2:09:28] now in genesis 10 speaking of the
[2:09:30] kingdom of nimrod it says
[2:09:32] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[2:09:34] babel and iraq and akhad
[2:09:37] and khalna in the land of china
[2:09:40] out of that land went forth asar and
[2:09:42] builded nineveh and kayla etc but the
[2:09:46] translators made a mistake in
[2:09:47] translating asser as a noun for it is a
[2:09:50] verb and in the chaldee means to make
[2:09:52] strong
[2:09:54] thus it is nimrod who having been made
[2:09:56] strong he established his kingdom by
[2:09:58] building the world's first army which he
[2:10:00] trained by drilling and through the
[2:10:01] rigors of hunting
[2:10:03] went beyond shinar with his strong army
[2:10:05] and subdued nations and built such
[2:10:06] cities as nineveh which was named after
[2:10:09] him for even today a chief part of the
[2:10:11] ruins of that city is called nimrod
[2:10:15] since we have discovered who ninus was
[2:10:18] it is now necessary to discover who his
[2:10:20] father was
[2:10:21] according to history it was bell the
[2:10:24] founder of babylon
[2:10:26] now it is to be noted here that bell
[2:10:28] founded it in the sense that he started
[2:10:30] this whole move but it was the sun ninus
[2:10:32] that established it and was the first
[2:10:34] king etc
[2:10:36] but according to the scripture the
[2:10:37] father of nimrod was kush and kush begat
[2:10:40] nimrod
[2:10:41] not only is this so but we find that ham
[2:10:43] begat cush
[2:10:45] now in the egyptian culture bell was
[2:10:47] called hermes and hermes means the son
[2:10:50] of ham
[2:10:51] according to history hermes was the
[2:10:53] great prophet of idolatry
[2:10:55] he was the interpreter of the gods
[2:10:58] another name by which he was called was
[2:11:00] mercury
[2:11:01] read acts fourteen eleven through twelve
[2:11:04] hygienist says this about that god who
[2:11:07] was known variously as bell hermes
[2:11:09] mercury etc for many ages men lived
[2:11:12] under the government of job
[2:11:14] not the roman job but jehovah of the
[2:11:16] hebrews who predates roman history
[2:11:18] without cities and without laws and all
[2:11:21] speaking one language
[2:11:23] but after that mercury bell
[2:11:26] interpreted the speeches of men
[2:11:28] whence an interpreter is called
[2:11:29] hermeneuties
[2:11:31] the same individual distributed the
[2:11:33] nations
[2:11:34] then discord began
[2:11:36] it is seen from this that bell or kush
[2:11:38] the father of nimrod originally was the
[2:11:41] ringleader that led the people away from
[2:11:42] the true god and encouraged the people
[2:11:44] as the interpreter of the gods to take
[2:11:47] another form of religion
[2:11:49] he encouraged them to go ahead with the
[2:11:51] tower which his son actually built
[2:11:53] this encouragement is what brought the
[2:11:55] confusion and the division of men
[2:11:57] so that he was both interpreter and
[2:12:00] confuser
[2:12:02] push then was the father of the
[2:12:04] polytheistic system and when men were
[2:12:06] deified by men he of course became the
[2:12:08] father of the gods
[2:12:10] now cush was called bell
[2:12:12] and bell in roman mythology was janus
[2:12:15] he is pictured as having two faces and
[2:12:17] he carried a club by which he confounded
[2:12:19] and scattered the people
[2:12:21] avid writes that jaina said concerning
[2:12:23] himself
[2:12:24] the ancients called me chaos
[2:12:27] thus we find that the kush of the bible
[2:12:29] the original rebel against monotheism
[2:12:31] was called bell
[2:12:32] bellis hermes janus etc amongst the
[2:12:35] ancient peoples
[2:12:37] he purported to bring revelations and
[2:12:39] interpretations from the gods to the
[2:12:40] people
[2:12:42] in so doing he caused the wrath of god
[2:12:44] to scatter the people bringing division
[2:12:46] and confusion
[2:12:48] now up to this point we have seen whence
[2:12:50] polytheism or the worship of many gods
[2:12:52] came
[2:12:53] but did you notice that we also found a
[2:12:55] mention of a man named cush who was
[2:12:57] given a title of the father of the gods
[2:13:00] did you notice here the old theme of
[2:13:01] ancient mythologies that gods identify
[2:13:04] themselves with men
[2:13:06] that is where ancestor worship comes
[2:13:08] from
[2:13:08] so we might just examine history to find
[2:13:10] out about ancestor worship
[2:13:12] well it was brought out that cush
[2:13:14] introduced a three god worship of father
[2:13:16] son and spirit
[2:13:18] three gods who were all equal
[2:13:20] but he knew about the seed of the woman
[2:13:22] coming so there would have to be a woman
[2:13:23] and her seed come into the picture
[2:13:26] this was brought to pass when nimrod
[2:13:28] died
[2:13:29] his wife semiramis deified him and thus
[2:13:32] made herself the mother of the son and
[2:13:34] also the mother of the gods
[2:13:36] just exactly as the roman church has
[2:13:38] deified mary
[2:13:39] they claim she was without sin and was
[2:13:41] the mother of god
[2:13:46] which means the woman's promised seed
[2:13:50] but it wasn't too long until the woman
[2:13:52] began to attract more attention than the
[2:13:54] sun and soon she was the one who was
[2:13:56] depicted as trampling underfoot the
[2:13:58] serpent
[2:13:59] they called her the queen of the heaven
[2:14:01] and made her divine
[2:14:03] how like today were in mary the mother
[2:14:05] of jesus had been elevated to
[2:14:07] immortality and right now as of
[2:14:08] september 1964
[2:14:11] the vatican council is attempting to
[2:14:12] give equality to mary she does not
[2:14:14] possess for they would like to call her
[2:14:17] marry the mediatrix
[2:14:18] mary the mother of all believers or
[2:14:20] mother of the church
[2:14:22] if there was ever babylonish ancestor
[2:14:24] worship in a religion it is the religion
[2:14:26] of the church of rome
[2:14:29] not only was ancestor worship originated
[2:14:31] in babylon but so also was the worship
[2:14:33] of nature it was in babylon the gods
[2:14:36] were identified with the sun and moon
[2:14:38] etc the chief object in nature was the
[2:14:41] sun which has light giving and heat
[2:14:42] giving properties and appears to man as
[2:14:45] a ball of fire in the heavens
[2:14:47] thus the chief god would be the sun god
[2:14:49] whom they called baal
[2:14:51] often the sun was depicted as a circle
[2:14:53] of flame and soon around that flame
[2:14:54] there appeared a serpent
[2:14:56] it wasn't long until the serpent became
[2:14:58] a symbol of the sun and consequently
[2:15:00] worshiped
[2:15:01] thus the desire of satan's heart became
[2:15:04] full-fledged he was worshiped as god his
[2:15:07] throne was established his slaves bowed
[2:15:09] to him
[2:15:10] there in pergamos in the form of a
[2:15:12] living serpent he was worshiped
[2:15:14] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[2:15:16] evil now symbolized in the form of a
[2:15:18] living serpent had not only seduced eve
[2:15:20] but the majority of mankind
[2:15:23] but how did pergamos become the seed of
[2:15:25] satan if babylon was the seat
[2:15:28] the answer again is in history
[2:15:30] when babylon fell to the medes and
[2:15:32] persians the priest king atlas fled the
[2:15:34] city and went to pergamos with his
[2:15:36] priests and sacred mysteries
[2:15:38] there he set up his kingdom outside the
[2:15:40] roman empire and thrived under the care
[2:15:42] of the devil
[2:15:44] this has been a very short resume of the
[2:15:46] history of the babylonish religion and
[2:15:48] its advent to pergamos
[2:15:50] many questions are no doubt left
[2:15:52] unanswered and much more no doubt could
[2:15:54] have been said to enlighten us but this
[2:15:56] is not intended to be a study of history
[2:15:58] rather it is intended to be a help to
[2:16:00] the study of the
[2:16:03] i i word love the way but the banana
[2:16:05] keeps putting it
[2:16:07] uh as he's taking us into the history
[2:16:10] then he comes out after a few pages well
[2:16:13] where will i stop this old history stuff
[2:16:16] this is not intended to teach you
[2:16:18] history
[2:16:19] it's intended to teach you the word yes
[2:16:22] but you see the reason why he goes ahead
[2:16:25] and puts these portions
[2:16:26] and i left you to listen to all that and
[2:16:28] maybe someone was also following online
[2:16:30] i wanted to listen to all that
[2:16:33] to be uninterrupted so that you can be
[2:16:35] able to see the history of the bible
[2:16:37] babylonish religion
[2:16:39] and you see how it came to pergamos
[2:16:41] and the connection it has with pegamos
[2:16:44] and you see how pegamos then becomes the
[2:16:46] seat and throne of saturn and actually
[2:16:48] like i told you that in the year 325
[2:16:50] that was like he started here
[2:16:54] where this politicism
[2:16:56] it is it was established properly
[2:16:58] in vegamas
[2:17:00] when they
[2:17:02] started the reduction of the trinity
[2:17:04] it was established properly during this
[2:17:06] time and
[2:17:07] you usually will find out that uh
[2:17:11] the police kind of view
[2:17:14] has never been
[2:17:16] and will never be
[2:17:17] a billion teaching
[2:17:20] because the bible was compiled a few
[2:17:23] years ago
[2:17:24] but here we have been able to find out
[2:17:26] that
[2:17:28] this kind of belief of many gods came
[2:17:31] much much later in the beginning there
[2:17:34] was no
[2:17:35] belief or worship of many gods
[2:17:38] in the beginning
[2:17:39] they used to worship one god they
[2:17:42] believed there was one god they didn't
[2:17:43] know much that we know today but they
[2:17:46] just believed there was one god some way
[2:17:48] and of course from the line of shame
[2:17:51] and we found out that
[2:17:53] even when you go down the line of shame
[2:17:56] he realized that they all worshipped one
[2:17:58] god until the time
[2:18:00] that
[2:18:01] nimrod started his worship of many gods
[2:18:04] can you imagine that
[2:18:06] these
[2:18:07] [Music]
[2:18:09] people
[2:18:11] uh as you have seen from every nation
[2:18:16] china
[2:18:18] uh what else
[2:18:21] india whatever
[2:18:28] [Music]
[2:18:30] japan india
[2:18:33] you know
[2:18:34] or even in south america all these
[2:18:37] nations all over the world
[2:18:40] they worship
[2:18:41] they have their form of forms of worship
[2:18:43] of very many gods
[2:18:45] he said all that but also again in
[2:18:47] africa
[2:18:48] but i think most of what we have had in
[2:18:50] africa is we've had people
[2:18:52] who believe there is a god up there
[2:18:55] but they also believe there are many
[2:18:58] small spirits
[2:19:01] and there is a god who is above there up
[2:19:03] there
[2:19:04] you know oh yeah you are going
[2:19:07] so they kind of believed in monotheism
[2:19:10] but in a way politicism in all over the
[2:19:13] world you will go by the way when you
[2:19:15] travel you see when i was in china i
[2:19:19] where did they get these things from
[2:19:21] when i come and read the church book the
[2:19:22] answers are right here
[2:19:25] the answers are right here
[2:19:27] let me tell you
[2:19:28] this message answers all the questions
[2:19:31] that we have
[2:19:34] all the questions in our generations are
[2:19:35] right here
[2:19:37] if you meet people who say that is not
[2:19:38] god
[2:19:39] bring them here show them where they
[2:19:41] begin with it always
[2:19:43] that's why it is good you encourage not
[2:19:45] don't just read read and share huh
[2:19:48] please share
[2:19:51] when you have friends that you are not
[2:19:52] sharing this with them you are joking
[2:19:54] you're not even
[2:19:55] i have not believed it you're just
[2:19:57] joking around you're just receiving us
[2:20:01] but if you really believe this message
[2:20:02] you're going to share it with your
[2:20:04] friends
[2:20:05] how can you claim that this is all
[2:20:07] enjoyable
[2:20:08] wow and then you don't share
[2:20:10] you just keep it to yourself
[2:20:12] it is impossible i tell it is impossible
[2:20:15] yeah it means you have not believed it
[2:20:17] but if you have surely believed that
[2:20:19] brother
[2:20:21] you're going to be on fire to share with
[2:20:23] somebody
[2:20:25] give it to somebody give it to somebody
[2:20:27] there's someone here there's someone
[2:20:29] also they let their eyes open and of
[2:20:31] course that is if your eyes are open
[2:20:37] you shall be saying you are there all by
[2:20:39] yourself and you figure out this person
[2:20:43] let me begin to see is
[2:20:44] with the battle for others
[2:20:46] this one has had an experience
[2:20:51] we'll cover the main main main parts of
[2:20:53] course there was one thing that i wanted
[2:20:55] to cover
[2:20:56] down here in the next subtropic he does
[2:20:59] talk about what happened in india
[2:21:02] or in this year
[2:21:03] the denunciation but i have a few things
[2:21:05] against me because
[2:21:08] that
[2:21:09] you have them that hold a doctrine of
[2:21:11] balance
[2:21:12] you know
[2:21:13] this is a very good one but we're not
[2:21:15] going to look at it now
[2:21:17] it talks about what takes place
[2:21:21] uh during that time
[2:21:23] those who are holding adoption obama
[2:21:26] then uh he also talks about the doctrine
[2:21:28] of the neurologist remember
[2:21:30] the doctrines the doctrine of the
[2:21:32] nicolaitan
[2:21:34] was initially
[2:21:38] uh it's a deed but then it has become a
[2:21:41] doctrine
[2:21:42] and then talks about adoption of balaam
[2:21:45] maybe maybe we'll address this in the
[2:21:47] church
[2:21:49] because of our time having been that our
[2:21:52] time is done here
[2:21:54] so then it talks about the warnings and
[2:21:56] then the rewards of what is the reward
[2:21:58] in every age for the overcomers of that
[2:22:01] age so i think for these two parts the
[2:22:03] doctrine of balance
[2:22:05] and the adoption of the
[2:22:06] nephilims you might the lord willing
[2:22:10] go through
[2:22:11] this in the church
[2:22:14] uh
[2:22:15] just pray and see how the lord will lead
[2:22:17] us
[2:22:19] god bless you
[2:22:20] any question on this chapter because we
[2:22:23] are not going back into it
[2:22:26] anyone with a question
[2:22:29] oh you're like oh yeah let me read and
[2:22:31] see when i will finish
[2:22:41] oh i see brother charles network is very
[2:22:44] low but
[2:22:45] well i'm sure that uh you'll get your
[2:22:47] potion and you've got a new question
[2:22:49] okay
[2:22:50] no one with a question
[2:22:52] some questions you have provided to me
[2:22:54] but i've been so busy i never got a
[2:22:56] chance to look at it
[2:22:59] have you read through them
[2:23:17] the bible clearly states about that
[2:23:21] you will be jacked those are the even
[2:23:23] the first people to be that you profess
[2:23:24] the wrath of god
[2:23:26] false prophet
[2:23:28] then i wanted also to look at
[2:23:31] your question was it one
[2:23:36] how many are they
[2:23:40] these are you are here you mean you
[2:23:41] cannot speak them
[2:23:43] you don't even remember them
[2:23:50] can you read page 208
[2:24:26] the why there is going to be a
[2:24:28] millennium but while
[2:24:30] that is going on you won't be in it you
[2:24:33] will be somewhere else
[2:24:35] hallelujah
[2:24:38] oh okay
[2:24:40] i think the bible mentions
[2:24:43] where he will be he says that uh
[2:24:46] where's my life
[2:24:50] he talks about the judgment
[2:24:55] yes
[2:25:02] okay
[2:25:09] just started in the book of revelation
[2:25:19] revelation 20 10
[2:25:22] and the devil that deceived them was
[2:25:24] accustomed to the lack of fire
[2:25:28] and brimstone where the beast
[2:25:30] and
[2:25:32] and
[2:25:34] yeah
[2:25:35] that have it in your bible
[2:25:37] where the beast and the false prophet
[2:25:39] are
[2:25:40] and shall be tormented day and night
[2:25:43] forever and
[2:25:47] ever hallelujah
[2:25:55] now remember this this one here
[2:25:59] is in
[2:26:00] revelation 20
[2:26:03] and by the time he's speaking this
[2:26:05] it is after the millennium
[2:26:09] it's after the millennium but uh the
[2:26:11] bible says but i'm actually saying that
[2:26:13] the rest of the dead leave the north for
[2:26:15] a thousand years
[2:26:17] let me pick and see where there's
[2:26:18] another scripture that i wanted to read
[2:26:20] okay yeah
[2:26:22] revelation 19 20.
[2:26:25] and that this was taken and with him the
[2:26:27] first prophet that wrote miracles before
[2:26:29] him
[2:26:30] with which he deceived them that had
[2:26:32] received the mark of the beast
[2:26:34] and then
[2:26:35] them that worshipped his image
[2:26:38] never worshipped his image
[2:26:41] and these both were cast alive
[2:26:45] into the lake of fire with the brimstone
[2:26:49] and the remnant we are slain with the
[2:26:50] sword of him that sat upon the horse
[2:26:53] which one proceeded out of his mouth and
[2:26:55] all the flowers were filled with their
[2:26:56] flesh
[2:26:57] my good lord it's gonna be quite a bad
[2:27:01] difficult time for them for the first
[2:27:02] profit and the beast as well
[2:27:06] what's the other question
[2:27:12] 177
[2:27:23] okay which question
[2:27:31] which question is
[2:27:44] yes
[2:27:45] yes
[2:27:46] it means
[2:27:48] yes we are saved by grace
[2:27:50] it's not the worst that we do
[2:27:54] if you dress properly
[2:27:57] that doesn't save you but that's not
[2:27:59] what i saved you
[2:28:02] but
[2:28:06] the salvation that you have received
[2:28:10] will make you dress proper
[2:28:13] if you don't dress properly it's a clear
[2:28:15] sign you have no faith
[2:28:18] and you are not believed
[2:28:21] but if you believe
[2:28:23] and
[2:28:24] you love jesus it will make you do the
[2:28:27] right thing
[2:28:28] you understand
[2:28:30] the works we do
[2:28:31] are not the reason why we are saved
[2:28:34] i preached that many times
[2:28:38] because i'm not smoking it doesn't mean
[2:28:40] that because i left
[2:28:42] smoking it means i'm safe because i
[2:28:44] don't drink alcohol i'm sick
[2:28:46] why are you safe
[2:28:48] i don't drink alcohol i don't you know
[2:28:50] for the kids i don't
[2:28:52] smoke i don't say satisfy yourself yes
[2:28:56] sorry
[2:28:58] there are people who don't do it
[2:29:00] as their own decisions
[2:29:03] yet they are not saved
[2:29:05] so you are served by grace through faith
[2:29:09] by grace through faith in christ alone
[2:29:13] and that grace
[2:29:14] will take you away from the things of
[2:29:16] the world that faith will mold you into
[2:29:20] the nature of jesus christ that faith
[2:29:23] will bring the works
[2:29:25] james says show me your faith
[2:29:29] without your works because of course you
[2:29:31] say faith you don't need wax eh so show
[2:29:33] it to me can you show it to me without
[2:29:34] your
[2:29:35] but i will show you my faith
[2:29:38] by
[2:29:39] my
[2:29:40] words
[2:29:41] it's only by our faith by our works
[2:29:44] people can see our faith
[2:29:46] but if you don't have wax
[2:29:48] if you don't have good works as a
[2:29:49] christian then your faith can be saved
[2:29:54] but the banh said you might be calling
[2:29:57] yourself a christian but if i come in
[2:29:59] your house and i hear that book you will
[2:30:00] give music going on
[2:30:02] forget about your testimony i don't want
[2:30:04] to hear it your life is shouting too
[2:30:06] loud but i can't see your testimony
[2:30:08] call yourself a christian and you dress
[2:30:10] a mini scarf
[2:30:14] your testimony your character your works
[2:30:16] is shouting that even when you talk i
[2:30:18] can't hear
[2:30:20] the the watch is too loud
[2:30:23] you get a point
[2:30:24] so please you call yourself a christian
[2:30:27] brother and then you you marry a girl
[2:30:28] like that
[2:30:30] you marry a girl who is a you know like
[2:30:32] you know even if she's calling herself a
[2:30:33] christian but today
[2:30:35] the believers will know who she is you
[2:30:36] know because of the way she's acting
[2:30:38] they they the character is not of christ
[2:30:40] their life is not a price she loves the
[2:30:42] world she goes into this kind of music
[2:30:45] and stuff like that and then she's all
[2:30:46] you know because
[2:30:48] you've married her because of beauty or
[2:30:49] because of the sex queen and stuff like
[2:30:50] that
[2:30:51] let me tell you
[2:30:53] you do that but i'm saying no matter
[2:30:55] what you think you are no matter what
[2:30:58] you say you are i don't see what you say
[2:31:01] you are i don't hear it because your
[2:31:03] testimony has already showed it by what
[2:31:05] you married hallelujah if i was very
[2:31:07] busy here preaching do you say i mean
[2:31:09] this message is true but actually i
[2:31:10] married in the message and the woman i
[2:31:12] married is not serving god it's not
[2:31:14] believing god is not
[2:31:16] giving respect to this message it shows
[2:31:18] you what i am

[2:31:46] manifest christ hallelujah
[2:31:48] amen at one time my daughter said yeah
[2:31:51] can i buy you a necklace she said no
[2:31:53] i said well i said well i was never
[2:31:55] raised with those things and i have no
[2:31:57] desire for them
[2:31:58] i said praise god
[2:32:00] that's right hallelujah
[2:32:02] and actually i was telling how can i buy
[2:32:04] you justice
[2:32:07] but if she said yes i would surely buy
[2:32:08] it for her
[2:32:15] but i'm glad
[2:32:16] she said she is not interested in
[2:32:17] cycling and any child of god will not be
[2:32:21] interested in such things
[2:32:24] any child of god will be interested
[2:32:26] in that character of christ
[2:32:29] not the say out what things you find
[2:32:31] even people call themselves believers
[2:32:33] younger gods
[2:32:34] they call themselves believers they
[2:32:36] don't wear necklace they don't wear your
[2:32:38] hand yeah they look again they don't
[2:32:39] have necklaces
[2:32:41] they don't wear nothing no makeup
[2:32:43] they come in the church they look holy
[2:32:46] all they dress properly on their wedding
[2:32:47] they look like yes
[2:32:50] let me tell you that's a clear sign that
[2:32:52] person has never been loved
[2:32:55] i know when people are getting married
[2:32:57] they have very many people around them
[2:32:59] even those who are not believers
[2:33:02] but my wife she was not my wife was not
[2:33:04] blessed by what by a believer even my
[2:33:07] own sister not a believer she paints
[2:33:10] herself but my wife did not accept those
[2:33:12] things he said i will not wear them
[2:33:15] they told her but you can wear something
[2:33:17] from here you know no i can't amen
[2:33:20] hallelujah
[2:33:23] they made me breathe
[2:33:24] you paint yourself and wear these kind
[2:33:27] of
[2:33:28] stuff
[2:33:29] it shows who you are shows what
[2:33:30] character in you you show the works that
[2:33:32] are
[2:33:33] your words show your testimony
[2:33:36] hallelujah no matter what you say you
[2:33:38] are i'm a believer for what
[2:33:42] that's not the kind of belief that the
[2:33:43] bible is talking about you watch your
[2:33:46] character you are test your works
[2:33:49] declare your testimony
[2:33:52] hallelujah
[2:33:54] you see then you go there and you begin
[2:33:56] putting stuff you never usually put on
[2:33:58] you are behaving like catholics who go
[2:34:00] to church and they never dress trousers
[2:34:01] and then when they come out they will
[2:34:03] dress naked but in the church
[2:34:06] you think that's our that's our religion
[2:34:08] this little religion this message
[2:34:10] religion
[2:34:11] that's why many people get out of it ah
[2:34:12] the standards are so high for you
[2:34:15] because you're trying to do it by your
[2:34:16] own words but if christ is in your heart
[2:34:18] he will change you you'll give you a new
[2:34:20] desire he will give you a new desire
[2:34:22] whereby your desire will will be there
[2:34:25] but you know
[2:34:26] he will suppress it and he his desire
[2:34:29] his will shall be that in your life
[2:34:32] you know don't think that because people
[2:34:34] dress things that are wrong it means
[2:34:36] they're fooled so it means they're not
[2:34:37] educated don't deceive yourself
[2:34:40] i've shown you videos here of believers
[2:34:42] even in other countries
[2:34:44] first world countries white people who
[2:34:47] don't dress short things
[2:34:49] who don't dress they don't understand
[2:34:50] things
[2:34:52] and they have all the money so it's not
[2:34:54] like they've lost their money and it's
[2:34:56] not like it is easy for them to get
[2:34:58] those long things it's not easy i've
[2:35:00] hosted some of them in my house and they
[2:35:02] give us that testimony it's not easy for
[2:35:04] them to get long things in their
[2:35:05] countries
[2:35:07] their country's gone down
[2:35:08] judged by god
[2:35:10] you know they can't get those good
[2:35:12] clothes
[2:35:13] that you see
[2:35:14] the ones that we can easily go at the
[2:35:16] shop there and you buy fifteen thousand
[2:35:18] twenty five thousand and you get a very
[2:35:20] beautiful dress their country is gone
[2:35:22] done
[2:35:23] you know
[2:35:24] they saw those things by themselves
[2:35:26] many of them make with their own hands
[2:35:29] in their own homes they saw they have
[2:35:31] their own sewing machine
[2:35:32] because they can't get it so they will
[2:35:34] do it by themselves man
[2:35:37] so
[2:35:37] what excuse do you have to say as i
[2:35:39] believe i can't get something wrong i
[2:35:41] can't get it means it is your appetite
[2:35:42] you you are the one with the problem if
[2:35:44] others can get it and you can't get it
[2:35:46] what is wrong with you you are the one
[2:35:48] with the wrong desire you have almost
[2:35:49] eyes because you do not have the desire
[2:35:51] to be like
[2:35:53] like like uh
[2:35:55] to manifest the life of christ but you
[2:35:56] want to manifest your desires let me
[2:35:58] tell you each of us have a desire to do
[2:36:00] things even younger men you know
[2:36:02] the things they are doing today the way
[2:36:04] they are putting their hair like
[2:36:05] lightening you know the way they are you
[2:36:07] know getting their trousers all
[2:36:10] it's like as if their thought is in
[2:36:12] there for whatever you know
[2:36:14] just touching them like that and then
[2:36:16] you know then they begin working like
[2:36:18] girls
[2:36:19] let me tell you these things
[2:36:21] what are you going to say when another
[2:36:23] one is getting a very good one you are
[2:36:25] getting that kind of thing you know
[2:36:27] it means it's your desire it is in you
[2:36:29] already you know but if you're a child
[2:36:32] of god you will be different your works
[2:36:34] will show what you believe me all
[2:36:36] through my life from since i was a
[2:36:38] teenager people used to say i look like
[2:36:40] old if you see the
[2:36:42] if you see the pictures i used to dress
[2:36:44] i i rather the crowd that i used to
[2:36:46] dress if you see in my old picture you
[2:36:48] wonder you'll be like ah and you know i
[2:36:51] was okay i was you know i can't say that
[2:36:53] i was really a villager no i had been
[2:36:56] out had well traveled and all that i was
[2:36:58] living with big people you know
[2:37:00] we had the money but
[2:37:02] something in me that
[2:37:04] you know now say oh i usually get
[2:37:06] something you know presentable at that
[2:37:08] time but you know i kind of loved you
[2:37:10] know to be different and you know i i
[2:37:13] would get those uh course you need to
[2:37:14] see some of those girls i used to wear
[2:37:16] you know like
[2:37:18] i would be like a child in that country
[2:37:22] because i didn't have the manager at
[2:37:23] that time to buy a very good quality of
[2:37:25] my size up just to go get you know
[2:37:26] someone would give me something and then
[2:37:28] i would change a little bit and then i
[2:37:30] just put myself myself in it it would
[2:37:32] look like a wrapping cloth inside
[2:37:36] but i was happy i was happy i was having
[2:37:38] god
[2:37:39] i was happy and
[2:37:41] yeah i would show you those pictures you
[2:37:42] know so but i i was never regretting you
[2:37:46] know i just loved god i served him and
[2:37:48] that when you asked me people asked me
[2:37:50] at that time how old was i and that was
[2:37:52] about 15 years ago if people asked you
[2:37:55] you would really say that i was 30 then
[2:37:57] or 40.
[2:37:58] so then by now you exam 60.
[2:38:02] but it's simply because of the way i was
[2:38:03] dressing when i saw my wife the first
[2:38:05] time i didn't really recognize her one
[2:38:06] of the reasons was the way she was
[2:38:08] dressed okay because she wasn't just too
[2:38:10] impressed
[2:38:11] okay she was dressed to be in the uh
[2:38:13] this the spirit and anointing about
[2:38:15] because we first met at a convention you
[2:38:17] know so talk about sisters who's good
[2:38:20] i don't want the bright side to deceive
[2:38:21] me there's a problem with him
[2:38:23] the problem with you
[2:38:25] people got the conversion but they
[2:38:39] yes
[2:38:40] but she had dressed like a mother's
[2:38:43] union you know my mother's union you
[2:38:44] don't know you don't know you know grows
[2:38:46] up yeah even she told me she had brought
[2:38:48] up
[2:38:49] with me you know
[2:38:50] yeah she apparently from a bigger woman
[2:38:51] you know
[2:39:06] [Music]
[2:39:23] we want to serve god and god help us
[2:39:25] also to serve one another
[2:39:28] so if you go in a convention to serve
[2:39:30] you know
[2:39:31] you know a brother or a sister to see
[2:39:33] you they will never see you you will be
[2:39:34] the one to go in the conversation every
[2:39:36] time
[2:39:37] you know it will be seen
[2:39:41] you are asked to present yourself as a
[2:39:43] child of god
[2:39:45] hallelujah because a true man the way
[2:39:48] you present yourself will attract that
[2:39:49] kind of man with that kind of
[2:39:51] if you present yourself with short stuff
[2:39:54] with a you know paintings and stuff like
[2:39:56] that don't forget you those who have
[2:39:58] affected those things but if you present
[2:40:00] yourself like a daughter of god you will
[2:40:02] get a son of god
[2:40:09] okay imagine the whole country believes
[2:40:11] the message who would lead us because we
[2:40:14] still need order
[2:40:16] and why does god hate politics thank you
[2:40:18] and i'll answer your question straight
[2:40:20] the world country can never believe the
[2:40:22] message
[2:40:23] it is impossible
[2:40:25] if it were to be possible there is no
[2:40:26] reason for us to preach
[2:40:29] the reason why we preach because
[2:40:32] there is something sick
[2:40:34] and when
[2:40:35] there was a time when the serpentine
[2:40:37] seed was not on earth
[2:40:39] god was the ruler he did not need man to
[2:40:41] rule
[2:40:42] god was the ruler of heaven and man was
[2:40:45] the ruler of earth
[2:40:46] so man himself was the ruler of earth
[2:40:48] and man was divine he did not need
[2:40:50] another man to lead him there was only
[2:40:52] one man
[2:40:53] ruling over the animals and the creation
[2:40:56] so
[2:40:57] look at it this way
[2:40:58] before city came into the world we never
[2:41:01] needed man to lead man
[2:41:03] we never did a man to rule man because
[2:41:05] man was ruling over the creation
[2:41:08] man was ruling over the world was ruling
[2:41:11] over the
[2:41:12] fish of the sea the vibes of the air the
[2:41:16] the animals the beasts of the field you
[2:41:18] understand man was controlling he was
[2:41:20] the one controlling them but today is
[2:41:21] man controlling them no
[2:41:24] you see so man is not doing he's a good
[2:41:26] given right
[2:41:27] man as a man has been overturned to rule
[2:41:31] man instead
[2:41:32] yet man was not supposed to rule my mind
[2:41:34] was supposed to rule
[2:41:38] the creatures
[2:41:39] even that's what the bible says that all
[2:41:41] the creation is groaning for the
[2:41:43] manifestation of the sons of god the
[2:41:46] animals are waiting that's why
[2:41:48] it happens sometimes you see some people
[2:41:50] they are gifted somehow to be able to
[2:41:52] control lions some people are gifted to
[2:41:54] control crocodiles yeah find them on
[2:41:56] youtube there
[2:41:58] that shows you that that's how man is
[2:41:59] supposed to be
[2:42:00] you know you know
[2:42:02] men control snakes
[2:42:05] you know
[2:42:06] the issue is that's how it is supposed
[2:42:08] to be mind is supposed to rule over the
[2:42:10] creatures but the creatures fear the man
[2:42:12] because man went out of his position
[2:42:14] so man does not have the glory that he
[2:42:16] used he used to have and he instead
[2:42:18] began to rule over another man it has
[2:42:21] never been the intention of god god
[2:42:23] intended for himself to be the king over
[2:42:25] the man and then man to be the king of
[2:42:27] other christians
[2:42:29] and and i can prove that to you when
[2:42:31] when god had chosen
[2:42:33] moses and he made moses the king um
[2:42:36] rather sorry but he met
[2:42:39] he church moses and adam moses um you
[2:42:42] know uh
[2:42:43] came out you know very mean actually
[2:42:45] meant to say abraham with moses out of
[2:42:47] abraham came out of nation a nation of
[2:42:48] israel then many years down the road
[2:42:51] they might apply and when they get uh
[2:42:53] very many people then they say well they
[2:42:55] see the nations around them of course at
[2:42:56] that time it was god ruling over them
[2:42:58] and he only had a prophet who was
[2:43:00] speaking the word of god it wasn't
[2:43:01] reading over everybody or anybody
[2:43:03] someone would simply come and say that's
[2:43:05] the other blah blah
[2:43:06] blah correct it or leave it if you
[2:43:08] connect it you get the blessings if you
[2:43:10] leave it god will rebuke you god not the
[2:43:12] prophet okay the work of the prophet is
[2:43:14] to speak the word of god and leave the
[2:43:16] same not to cause law and order it was
[2:43:18] god himself doing the law and the law
[2:43:20] and order okay
[2:43:21] so god speaks the word they don't really
[2:43:23] do it you come with your cows things
[2:43:25] come and then you have to repent then it
[2:43:27] becomes fine so god was the direct ruler
[2:43:29] of these people
[2:43:31] and then when people saw that the people
[2:43:33] around them and everybody was doing good
[2:43:35] oh
[2:43:36] we want to really be like them look at
[2:43:38] this they have a king oh look at how
[2:43:40] good he's gay their king looks like oh
[2:43:42] it's rich and they all they the prestige
[2:43:44] at all that country's respect but look
[2:43:46] at us we are farmers we are we don't
[2:43:48] even have anyone rooting over us we're
[2:43:49] just coming here and then disappearing
[2:43:52] going back to the woods ah
[2:43:53] it's so boring it looks so so you know
[2:43:56] so bad and you know they were like we
[2:43:58] also need that king we also need that
[2:43:59] kingdom somewhere we are telling that
[2:44:01] kind of thing you just come
[2:44:10] what is this then god told him don't you
[2:44:12] worry somewhere they have not rejected
[2:44:14] you
[2:44:14] they have rejected
[2:44:17] you see so that's why in the true chat
[2:44:19] of the living god it's not the man that
[2:44:21] ruled the child it is the holy ghost
[2:44:23] that ruled the church through those men
[2:44:25] those men ruled by the holy ghost and
[2:44:27] the word you see just like it used to be
[2:44:29] the oldest amen
[2:44:30] now
[2:44:32] when they rejected god he told them
[2:44:34] those people who have rejected me they
[2:44:37] have accepted people to rule over them
[2:44:38] and indeed the people shall rule over
[2:44:40] them but they will make them suffer they
[2:44:42] will be the lord their lords they will
[2:44:44] make them you understand yes show them
[2:44:46] fine let them and indeed that's what
[2:44:48] happened the kings killed the people the
[2:44:51] things persuaded the people the things
[2:44:53] stole from the people they can't destroy
[2:44:55] their wives they can you understand
[2:44:57] that's what kings do when a man rules
[2:44:59] over another
[2:45:00] man is cruel man is rude man is bad but
[2:45:04] god is a god of mercy god is a god of
[2:45:07] peace god is a god of judgment god is a
[2:45:09] god he is a god who doesn't judge
[2:45:12] without um
[2:45:14] uh
[2:45:15] huh
[2:45:17] yeah without first warning you and so
[2:45:19] god is a good is a he's a good god but
[2:45:22] you see so my sister god hates politics
[2:45:25] because politics is not from god
[2:45:26] politics is from the devil
[2:45:28] hallelujah
[2:45:30] and so i'll tell you that right if
[2:45:32] you've been thinking of going into
[2:45:33] politics run away from politics don't do
[2:45:36] that because politics is of the devil
[2:45:38] okay go into something which will make
[2:45:41] the people see the kingdom of god even
[2:45:43] these other casual jobs do you want to
[2:45:45] be what
[2:45:46] an engineer do you want to be what
[2:45:50] builder okay do you want to be white
[2:45:52] agriculturalist do you want to be one
[2:45:54] now whatever you want to be in this room
[2:45:57] you want to be a doctor oh i have a
[2:45:59] doctor here an engineer here in the
[2:46:01] making
[2:46:02] everywhere you are those departments
[2:46:05] are ruled and controlled by the devil
[2:46:09] did you know that
[2:46:11] but
[2:46:12] those industries you at the time of work
[2:46:14] and go there very simply get money to
[2:46:17] sustain your family and also
[2:46:20] to live an input of a child of god
[2:46:25] brother martin was telling me the other
[2:46:27] day that he was having his
[2:46:30] uh father
[2:46:31] and his father is a police officer one
[2:46:34] of the high ranking but not up there but
[2:46:36] he's really high ranking also he's been
[2:46:38] in the fossil for a very long time
[2:46:40] but where he is at the moment he
[2:46:42] suffered very many things many problems
[2:46:44] out of those people
[2:46:46] because he has refused he has hindered
[2:46:48] them
[2:46:50] to get to be corrupt and so they have
[2:46:52] tried even to make him look as if he was
[2:46:54] the one who is corrupt because
[2:46:56] to remove him from the system
[2:46:58] but god has always been with him even
[2:47:00] recently the case that he put on him god
[2:47:02] removed it from me
[2:47:05] so when you're a child of god you're
[2:47:06] going in a field you walk faithfully
[2:47:09] but don't you dare stand for
[2:47:11] you know elected politics that's not
[2:47:13] your place
[2:47:15] because surely it is rotten to the car
[2:47:18] it is brought into the call i'll tell
[2:47:20] you that
[2:47:21] the bible says we are to give attention
[2:47:24] a tenth of our saturday
[2:47:26] for offertory
[2:47:28] what if now let me first put that
[2:47:30] correct you do not give a tenth for all
[2:47:32] factory no
[2:47:35] a tenth
[2:47:37] is the same as a tax
[2:47:40] and a tenth
[2:47:42] is ten percent of your earnings
[2:47:45] but remember
[2:47:46] when you walked who blessed you
[2:47:49] gosh
[2:47:50] so the money of what whose is it
[2:47:54] some someone said it is mine now i will
[2:47:57] tell you that man is not yours
[2:47:59] it is god who has given it to you
[2:48:02] if you have got a hundred thousand it's
[2:48:04] not yours it is god who has given it to
[2:48:07] you
[2:48:08] you might say for my strength it is he
[2:48:10] will give you strength
[2:48:12] for my reason it is him who gave you
[2:48:14] wisdom so it is god
[2:48:16] who gives you that money
[2:48:18] now that you get 100 000
[2:48:21] don't say it's all my money no it's god
[2:48:22] is money but it's always testing you
[2:48:24] this is just like you like you would
[2:48:26] give something to a child
[2:48:28] and then you say give me back give me
[2:48:30] something and i shall say
[2:48:32] that's how people are
[2:48:34] you god gives you he says give me
[2:48:36] something small let me let me also eat
[2:48:39] you or many times you say god let me
[2:48:41] hear this is all mine
[2:48:43] imagine looks foolish doesn't it
[2:48:45] that is how it is when god says fair
[2:48:48] ties to me and then you'll be like ah
[2:48:51] money i've studied for money i've even
[2:48:53] suffered to ask you to give it to me
[2:48:56] imagine tithe is not yours just like
[2:49:00] even the other money which you have all
[2:49:03] your money is not yours it is goddess
[2:49:05] but tithe is meant
[2:49:07] to test you
[2:49:09] and see where is your faith
[2:49:12] is your faith in god
[2:49:14] do you believe he is your provider
[2:49:16] if you indeed believe is your provider
[2:49:19] then you will give back to his giving
[2:49:21] back
[2:49:24] it is he is saying do you believe i'm
[2:49:26] gonna give it to you you say yes lord i
[2:49:28] believe
[2:49:29] oh
[2:49:30] if you believe i am the one who gave it
[2:49:32] to you
[2:49:33] give me a piece of it to prove it
[2:49:36] that's all he's saying give me a piece
[2:49:38] of it to prove it that it is a new
[2:49:40] giving he doesn't need your money does
[2:49:42] god need our money does god need it
[2:49:44] where does he receive it from he doesn't
[2:49:46] need it
[2:49:47] right especially if you look at it
[2:49:49] surely that's good need money
[2:49:52] so we're not trying to say that god
[2:49:54] the pastors collect that man somewhere
[2:49:56] and then they forward it to god
[2:49:57] somewhere
[2:49:58] okay no
[2:49:59] god doesn't need your money
[2:50:02] okay
[2:50:03] god needs your heart
[2:50:04] and in a bid of getting your heart he is
[2:50:07] saying i need to test you to see whether
[2:50:08] your heart
[2:50:10] has faith in me whether your heart
[2:50:12] believes
[2:50:14] in my hand of provision
[2:50:16] and for you to prove that you need to
[2:50:18] take a piece of what i've given you
[2:50:20] and give it
[2:50:22] to the priesthood
[2:50:24] as a sign
[2:50:26] that you've given back to me
[2:50:28] because the priesthood would remember he
[2:50:31] said that this priesthood
[2:50:33] is mine
[2:50:34] there were 12 tribes but one of them is
[2:50:37] at the top of levi he said this one is
[2:50:39] mine
[2:50:40] the rest had the inheritance in the land
[2:50:42] but this one did not
[2:50:45] the rest were working and having jobs
[2:50:46] this one did not because they committed
[2:50:48] themselves to serve god all the rest of
[2:50:49] their life these ones they are not
[2:50:51] receiving the piece of land in the
[2:50:53] announcement of land they that will be
[2:50:55] known so god said don't worry about this
[2:50:56] one this one is mine but then it comes
[2:50:59] back to this and it says okay as these
[2:51:00] ones are serving me i i using i'm using
[2:51:03] them to serve you
[2:51:04] now you you're going to work on the
[2:51:06] switch and then i'll bring back
[2:51:07] attendance to these ones
[2:51:09] these ones they'll receive it as their
[2:51:11] income and they will live on it and
[2:51:13] therefore preachers and pastors are
[2:51:15] really actually supposed to live on life
[2:51:18] but that's none of your business
[2:51:20] your business is to understand and
[2:51:22] acknowledge that god is the one who
[2:51:25] provided to you so if you so believe
[2:51:27] that god provided for you
[2:51:29] then you give back to him a tenth of
[2:51:32] your income
[2:51:33] that is mandatory
[2:51:35] to every professing christian and a
[2:51:37] christian who doesn't pay tithe they can
[2:51:39] never prospect financially
[2:51:41] take that for me they can never prosper
[2:51:44] and i mean a christian i'm not saying
[2:51:47] the lady i mean a christian including
[2:51:49] pastors everyone must pay right that's
[2:51:52] right
[2:51:53] okay i'm not teaching titan videos i'm
[2:51:56] just answering a question here and if
[2:51:58] there is more questions on this then
[2:52:00] maybe i can have a service on it
[2:52:02] the bible says we are giving a tenth of
[2:52:04] our salary for offertory
[2:52:06] no it's not for offertory there is tithe
[2:52:09] that's ten percent then offertory that
[2:52:11] is the offering free will
[2:52:13] the other one he told he just said you
[2:52:14] said give me ten percent it is you have
[2:52:17] one hundred thousand oh
[2:52:18] give me the ten thousand on his mind he
[2:52:20] said it is mine if you don't give it to
[2:52:22] me you've robbed me that is mine
[2:52:24] i gave it to you
[2:52:26] but i want it back
[2:52:28] so prove to me that you believe i'm done
[2:52:29] will give you and i can give you more
[2:52:31] then you give you say ah now you are now
[2:52:33] you i can prove to you i will give you
[2:52:35] more already first fish
[2:52:37] so when you pay the type
[2:52:40] that is god is he says it is mine he
[2:52:43] himself is what he says it is mine
[2:52:45] that have a proof may and safe i will
[2:52:47] not bless you with more
[2:52:49] it is in malachi 3 okay we'll read it
[2:52:51] later then he says if you give that one
[2:52:54] then now now also you can give what you
[2:52:57] want to do from what you are meaning
[2:53:01] are you heading
[2:53:02] after you paid that one let me tell you
[2:53:04] whether you are received from a gift
[2:53:06] or from a friend or from salary some
[2:53:09] people thought that they were currently
[2:53:10] peptides when they are earning salary
[2:53:13] as long as it is money which you
[2:53:15] are going to control and it doesn't have
[2:53:17] to be money only it can be anything
[2:53:21] you know
[2:53:22] you can save your land a piece of wheat
[2:53:24] is tight
[2:53:26] you you you can have 10 goats one god is
[2:53:30] death
[2:53:31] you can you understand
[2:53:32] so
[2:53:33] whatever it is that you you receive
[2:53:37] you must i feel as a christian and this
[2:53:39] principle is what
[2:53:42] personally since i knew about it i have
[2:53:44] lived in amen
[2:53:46] for about 16 years now
[2:53:48] and god has been faithful
[2:53:50] it's a principle that a christian every
[2:53:52] creature must do it and don't ever feel
[2:53:54] that i'm giving my time
[2:53:56] no that's just i'm giving back to god it
[2:53:59] is not yours it is god is he says he is
[2:54:02] therefore if you have a budget and your
[2:54:04] income is thousand and you're making a
[2:54:06] budget make a budget for 90 000
[2:54:08] and in that budget friendly have an
[2:54:10] include offering
[2:54:11] because offering is according to what
[2:54:13] you desire
[2:54:15] maybe i would give god one i remember
[2:54:17] i'm receiving a hundred thousand
[2:54:25] what is going to be my uh what will i
[2:54:27] give to the work of the lord you know
[2:54:30] okay i'll give that a thought
[2:54:35] did you see the bible says god love that
[2:54:36] generous
[2:54:38] giver
[2:54:39] if you give generosity god will give you
[2:54:40] generous
[2:54:42] now
[2:54:43] your title is how much 10 000 but your
[2:54:46] offering was how much thirty thousand
[2:54:50] so some people they think when i pay
[2:54:51] tight i'm done now i can move around
[2:54:54] as a christian when you pay your tithe
[2:54:56] you have just started yes that is not
[2:54:59] even yours you need to give you yourself
[2:55:01] you didn't give anything
[2:55:04] you yourself didn't give anything as a
[2:55:06] matter of fact many times i have even
[2:55:08] too
[2:55:08] i will not say this on there on the
[2:55:10] youtube
[2:55:11] so
[2:55:12] you yourself give me you must give
[2:55:14] something as a christian you must give
[2:55:17] hallelujah
[2:55:18] okay
[2:55:20] now
[2:55:20] that that is according to what you
[2:55:22] desire according to on your own
[2:55:24] discretion right
[2:55:25] when they bring when they pass the bible
[2:55:27] to you don't say i already paid my
[2:55:28] judges
[2:55:29] pass
[2:55:30] no
[2:55:31] pick out from what you have
[2:55:33] and don't even just decide there
[2:55:36] you have to be prepared
[2:55:38] when i go to church today i'll give the
[2:55:40] lord this much
[2:55:43] ah you people seem not to know anything
[2:55:45] about this i think i have to
[2:55:47] make an extension teaching on this with
[2:55:49] with the scriptures
[2:55:51] what if you get money but use it for god
[2:55:54] is work like visit the sick
[2:55:56] remember that is like uncertainty
[2:55:59] like unplanned
[2:56:00] for it just comes
[2:56:02] and the rest you use it for home things
[2:56:05] and you find money is done
[2:56:08] will it be
[2:56:11] will it be a cast to you
[2:56:13] yes it will be a cast to you if you do
[2:56:14] not pay your time
[2:56:16] life must never be negotiated now
[2:56:19] you have received don't plan to pay your
[2:56:22] tithe
[2:56:24] me whenever i receive anything in my
[2:56:26] hands
[2:56:27] the first thing i do before i think of
[2:56:29] all the needs i have is time
[2:56:32] that's the first thing first things
[2:56:34] first
[2:56:35] my hands are crossed
[2:56:36] i receive how much one million okay one
[2:56:39] million how much is goodies
[2:56:43] i put it in me i never even
[2:56:46] don't even have a second thought of it i
[2:56:48] don't even have anything in my mind that
[2:56:50] maybe i can even borrow me
[2:56:52] completely not i know that one i don't
[2:56:54] even count it
[2:56:56] it's a goddess
[2:56:57] hallelujah
[2:56:59] and i've always used it for the lord
[2:57:01] now i can plan with a 900
[2:57:04] and that would mean that i cannot plan
[2:57:06] maybe to give god something maybe also
[2:57:08] to you know those things you're talking
[2:57:10] about they will come in with that yeah
[2:57:12] yeah maybe oh they are now because they
[2:57:15] wanted more money i did not plan but
[2:57:16] it's okay i can use some of this
[2:57:18] then they also have the sick person okay
[2:57:23] you understand
[2:57:24] whatever you want to do after that
[2:57:26] use it from that other remainder that
[2:57:28] you have because you actually actually
[2:57:31] have 905 and you don't have one
[2:57:34] you actually have 99
[2:57:36] so if you don't pay your tithe you are
[2:57:38] under a cash
[2:57:40] a financial curse
[2:57:43] where you cannot be blessed no matter
[2:57:45] how much you work
[2:57:46] where your money will just disappear
[2:57:49] where the bible says you put in your
[2:57:51] pocket it will just disappear it will go
[2:57:53] through your pocket will have holes
[2:57:55] where you you put it to a business
[2:57:57] investment and everything just goes
[2:58:00] everything will at the others they will
[2:58:02] prosper yours
[2:58:04] if they are crops they will dry
[2:58:06] if their crops it is there's no storm
[2:58:08] which will come to you once
[2:58:10] if it is a something it is i mean
[2:58:12] problems will come to you at least
[2:58:13] people get sick and like you are saying
[2:58:15] problems will come because you don't pay
[2:58:17] your time
[2:58:18] and whatever you touch will not be
[2:58:20] blessed
[2:58:21] and now as i summarize this question
[2:58:24] answer to this question
[2:58:25] we do not pay our tithe to become rich
[2:58:31] we pay our tithe
[2:58:33] as
[2:58:35] a
[2:58:36] an act of faith
[2:58:39] everything as a christian we do it as an
[2:58:41] act of faith
[2:58:43] you do not dress properly to go to
[2:58:44] heaven
[2:58:46] right
[2:58:47] but you do it as an act of faith
[2:58:50] so you don't pay your tithe to become
[2:58:52] rich
[2:58:53] if you do that for that purpose you will
[2:58:56] never become rich actually you remain
[2:58:57] the way you are because you have the
[2:58:58] wrong intention your giving is not
[2:59:01] having the right requirement you must
[2:59:03] give you the right way also it's just
[2:59:05] like if you know someone is in need
[2:59:08] then you just
[2:59:10] tell them okay
[2:59:11] everybody this man you see him he's
[2:59:14] suffering
[2:59:15] will come here
[2:59:16] recording me
[2:59:17] from today you're not going to suffer
[2:59:19] anymore i'm giving you this heaven how
[2:59:21] much do you need 2 million don't want me
[2:59:23] to give a gift i
[2:59:26] think your blessing is finished
[2:59:30] you have given very big but your
[2:59:32] blessing is finished
[2:59:35] by those people clapping for you and
[2:59:36] seeing you and enjoying your giving
[2:59:39] but when
[2:59:41] you want if you want the lord to bless
[2:59:43] you
[2:59:44] give in secret
[2:59:45] if you want to help someone give him
[2:59:46] secret
[2:59:48] don't blow your own trumpet giving
[2:59:50] secret and don't talk about it
[2:59:53] say
[2:59:54] you know i gave him a second but that's
[2:59:55] why you brother i know you will talk to
[2:59:56] you you're not giving the other brother
[2:59:58] you know that's
[2:59:59] where i'm the one who gave it to me
[3:00:02] no please
[3:00:04] don't do that
[3:00:06] if you do that it won't take you to hell
[3:00:08] but your blessings are done
[3:00:10] so if you want to work in a life of
[3:00:12] prosperity in the life of blessings
[3:00:14] be a practicing christian pay your tithe
[3:00:19] give your offerings
[3:00:21] support the calls
[3:00:23] now you're about to begin collecting
[3:00:25] church building funds you people believe
[3:00:27] all of you are going to collect very big
[3:00:29] big sounds of money hallelujah
[3:00:31] yes all of you are going to collect
[3:00:33] in fact you should begin correctly
[3:00:35] maybe even after this we should do yeah
[3:00:37] we should have already
[3:00:39] okay out of this youtube meeting we
[3:00:41] should maybe uh
[3:00:43] leave with some money you know
[3:00:45] yes for the youth building project yes
[3:00:48] not the beauty buddy
[3:00:50] we need to first buy land eh
[3:00:52] yeah did you tell them
[3:00:54] yes
[3:00:56] we are already looking
[3:00:57] so please when we start that project you
[3:01:00] give
[3:01:01] and don't tell anybody that you get
[3:01:05] some people when you come in the chat
[3:01:07] and you say okay we are now collecting
[3:01:09] uh-huh you
[3:01:11] 5000 ah let me now give more than him
[3:01:14] you a hundred thousand
[3:01:16] okay that one should give more than me
[3:01:18] you 500 everybody will say
[3:01:20] [Music]
[3:01:23] you yeah
[3:01:29] yeah yeah i will pledge you later
[3:01:31] because you are fearing so there are
[3:01:40] it shows you that they have got a
[3:01:41] revolution of what
[3:01:43] giving so maybe one of these days we
[3:01:45] shall preach on that seriously brother
[3:01:47] you had a question
[3:01:56] yes
[3:02:02] yes which is one million
[3:02:18] okay what's the type of 10 million
[3:02:24] 1 million
[3:02:25] let me ask you a question
[3:02:27] is there anyone who will ever receive
[3:02:28] money that is enough for them
[3:02:31] no one earns money that is enough for
[3:02:33] them
[3:02:34] brother billy paul i want you to know it
[3:02:36] from today you can never earn
[3:02:39] the money that you need
[3:02:42] all that you want
[3:02:44] all right
[3:02:45] so that's why we have what we call
[3:02:47] budgets
[3:02:48] do you know what a budget is
[3:02:52] what is a budget
[3:02:57] yes
[3:02:58] even if you earn 20 million
[3:03:01] and you don't have a budget you can
[3:03:03] spend it all
[3:03:05] and you remain with a very big
[3:03:09] a very big one
[3:03:11] a very big one
[3:03:13] we don't have business people you said
[3:03:14] you wanted to be in business you can't
[3:03:15] even give me the right words
[3:03:18] deficit thank you
[3:03:20] because a deficit means
[3:03:22] the money that you were supposed to find
[3:03:25] your budget with
[3:03:27] but you've not received it so you still
[3:03:29] need it
[3:03:31] so that's why we buy it why do we budget
[3:03:33] so that we can prioritize
[3:03:35] those things that we need
[3:03:38] and we leave those things that we want
[3:03:40] other things which we can do later yes
[3:03:43] yes but the lord is money tithe not even
[3:03:46] ever risen reasoning is out
[3:03:49] okay
[3:03:50] someone said what if i have a alone or
[3:03:53] someone is demanding me money
[3:03:55] even if someone is demanding you before
[3:03:57] you think of paying them first to pay
[3:03:58] your time
[3:04:00] then now you can come to england
[3:04:03] that is the law of god
[3:04:05] and
[3:04:07] christians all over the world
[3:04:09] black white green yellow if they are
[3:04:11] there also
[3:04:12] they practice it
[3:04:14] and god blesses them
[3:04:17] very far i think i've answered your
[3:04:19] question brother
[3:04:20] yes
[3:04:39] okay
[3:04:41] it is good to give a testimony
[3:04:44] but also a testimony of pride you can
[3:04:46] differentiate it from a testimony that
[3:04:48] is you don't need to blow your own trap
[3:04:51] let them be the one to give that
[3:04:52] testimony
[3:04:54] usually that's what i do
[3:04:56] i've helped many people in this life
[3:04:58] but i never do
[3:04:59] really talk about it
[3:05:02] what is there what is there to eat let
[3:05:04] them talk for me if they talk for me no
[3:05:06] problem
[3:05:08] but if i talk for myself what i've done
[3:05:10] for them is like broke my own trumpet
[3:05:12] the other person never said why should i
[3:05:14] if they thought it should be a secret
[3:05:16] fight
[3:05:17] if they're not grateful fine i don't do
[3:05:20] it for them for them to blow my trumpet
[3:05:22] i did it for them for the glory of god
[3:05:25] that if i don't need to blow my trumpet
[3:05:27] yes
[3:05:29] i've seen people would do that but i
[3:05:30] don't really quite like that spirit also
[3:05:32] why why would you i've helped brother
[3:05:34] son so
[3:05:35] you know this younger man i picked him
[3:05:37] up when he couldn't even you know he
[3:05:39] didn't have shoes in his feet what what
[3:05:41] what
[3:05:45] well
[3:05:46] it depends on the circumstance and the
[3:05:48] atmosphere
[3:05:49] yes
[3:05:55] yes
[3:05:56] yes
[3:06:03] when your tithe is received for on the
[3:06:05] on the total sum your your type you give
[3:06:08] your tithe on a total sum of income
[3:06:11] whenever no matter if you if you receive
[3:06:13] 10th of a hundred thousand
[3:06:15] every week then you should give ten
[3:06:17] thousand every week
[3:06:19] if you receive one thousand every month
[3:06:21] then you should give
[3:06:22] i mean if you receive a hundred thousand
[3:06:24] every month then you should give ten
[3:06:25] thousand every man
[3:06:27] ten percent is out of the total earning
[3:06:30] whenever you earn
[3:06:32] and the offering is unlimited you can
[3:06:34] even give everything in remember nothing
[3:06:36] you have testimonies of people who have
[3:06:38] got a stolen give everything you have
[3:06:40] they gave
[3:06:42] yes and god bless them yes of course
[3:06:45] the pentecostals preach it well by the
[3:06:47] way but they have a wrong
[3:06:51] intention behind it so that makes it
[3:06:53] right wrong yes
[3:07:02] okay that is your time yes
[3:07:04] but the whole man you must keep giving
[3:07:07] will never you you because god keeps
[3:07:10] supplying right
[3:07:12] then you must keep giving but not giving
[3:07:14] tight
[3:07:16] if you had a hundred thousand
[3:07:20] you are paying tight on you are a
[3:07:22] hundred thousand don't pay it again on
[3:07:24] that 100
[3:07:27] you give offerings
[3:07:28] that is according to what you want to
[3:07:30] give you can give five percent two
[3:07:32] percent one percent zero point five
[3:07:34] percent depending it's not a percentage
[3:07:36] it is any that you want to give
[3:07:39] but whenever even if you you earned more
[3:07:42] money than you expected don't say i'm
[3:07:44] now
[3:07:44] that way my soul is supposed to be a
[3:07:46] hundred thousand and today i'm receiving
[3:07:47] two hundred thousand i will not give you
[3:07:49] the other hundred thousand you always
[3:07:51] give or up
[3:07:53] ten percent out of every earning
[3:07:56] yes
[3:07:58] yes
[3:08:18] thank you
[3:08:20] hey look it is not right
[3:08:24] me
[3:08:26] some people use that language
[3:08:28] but i actually
[3:08:30] feel offended in my speech
[3:08:32] when someone
[3:08:33] tells me
[3:08:35] that they spent money
[3:08:36] and when they begin to tell me what they
[3:08:38] spent it on they begin to tell me that
[3:08:40] they also spectrum type
[3:08:42] it wasn't your expenditure
[3:08:45] it wasn't your expansion
[3:08:48] if you if i give you my money to keep
[3:08:49] for you i mean if you give if you give
[3:08:52] me your money to keep for you huh
[3:08:54] and then i give it back to you
[3:08:56] can i even talk about it is it even
[3:08:58] right
[3:08:59] that i even spent on brother nani did i
[3:09:02] spend on me
[3:09:05] i kept for you and now i was returning
[3:09:08] how can i even talk about it
[3:09:10] i shouldn't even talk about it at all
[3:09:11] whatsoever
[3:09:13] because it's a dramatic that i would i
[3:09:15] should return your money therefore if
[3:09:17] you are giving accountability for the
[3:09:19] moneys unless it wasn't your money but
[3:09:20] if it's your money actually you
[3:09:21] shouldn't even pay tighter on the money
[3:09:22] which is not yours
[3:09:24] you better even what do you owe you
[3:09:26] yours
[3:09:27] and
[3:09:28] and once you have paid tight don't if
[3:09:31] your mom sends you to the market say
[3:09:33] somebody go to the market and they
[3:09:35] buy you know tomatoes then their houses
[3:09:38] have received it
[3:09:40] that infrastructure
[3:09:52] you know so it's not yours yeah if they
[3:09:56] give you my preschool phrase don't touch
[3:09:58] it
[3:09:59] okay
[3:09:59] but if they give you your pocket money
[3:10:01] type that one that one is your money
[3:10:02] right you can use it the way you want so
[3:10:05] you must take that one
[3:10:06] so
[3:10:07] you taste your income
[3:10:09] and
[3:10:11] what was your question
[3:10:14] all right so then we don't need to talk
[3:10:16] really about it as well
[3:10:23] if it is a fundraising for the wedding
[3:10:25] and quantity okay you can talk about it
[3:10:32] i will tell you what if you are married
[3:10:35] then that also goes back to who have you
[3:10:37] married
[3:10:40] my wife can never ask me such questions
[3:10:41] do you know why we plan together
[3:10:45] we plan together
[3:10:47] yeah
[3:10:48] what are we going
[3:10:50] to do
[3:10:51] this month
[3:10:52] abcd this is what we need that is what
[3:10:54] we have always let me tell you you
[3:10:56] people you're gonna get there always you
[3:10:59] have
[3:11:00] you have less than what you need to
[3:11:01] spend just know that
[3:11:04] but while we are planning
[3:11:05] we don't budget
[3:11:07] i told you if we see one million we
[3:11:09] don't buy it for one million we bought
[3:11:10] it from 900 pounds
[3:11:13] that's why
[3:11:15] and
[3:11:16] she knows it i know it because both of
[3:11:17] us should pay
[3:11:18] right
[3:11:19] but it doesn't mean that it is one
[3:11:21] million now
[3:11:23] we are paying one hundred thousand
[3:11:24] should also put another no
[3:11:26] it's our income you pay the same
[3:11:35] and it is not right to talk about i paid
[3:11:37] the time i even did this did you pay it
[3:11:40] wasn't yours to begin with so how can
[3:11:42] you even discuss it
[3:11:44] yes
[3:11:54] you pay your time
[3:11:55] to the loan
[3:12:00] no you pay it to your past
[3:12:03] you know but i'm saying is that every
[3:12:04] month every person must have a church
[3:12:08] remember i even preached about it the
[3:12:09] other day you know it's not good for
[3:12:11] christians to be flying everywhere
[3:12:14] today you are here i got away from
[3:12:20] you're flying around
[3:12:21] no you must have a church home
[3:12:24] where you go
[3:12:25] where you attend where you hear the word
[3:12:27] from where you're feeding from
[3:12:29] actually your home church is where you
[3:12:31] eat from
[3:12:33] if someone comes to me and i'm not
[3:12:35] feeding them any spiritual food
[3:12:37] and they take me i will not receive
[3:12:39] because
[3:12:40] not their pastor
[3:12:42] but if someone takes to me then i must
[3:12:44] ensure they are fed spiritually
[3:12:47] you understand
[3:12:48] yeah i must assure they are fed
[3:12:50] maybe my minister has been a blessing to
[3:12:52] them
[3:12:53] and they say well from today you're my
[3:12:54] pastor
[3:12:56] then i can receive their type
[3:12:58] understand
[3:12:59] uh
[3:13:00] but also some people you they can come
[3:13:02] for example they can go
[3:13:04] and visit in a chat somewhere and then
[3:13:06] they maybe they they visit there they
[3:13:08] they live there for one year two years
[3:13:09] and then they still say that you might
[3:13:11] want to charge me
[3:13:13] you know and then they test the other
[3:13:15] place when again they are feeding from
[3:13:16] that's not also right
[3:13:18] i believe you must
[3:13:20] say where is your home church your own
[3:13:22] church is where you eat from where you
[3:13:23] feel from
[3:13:25] that is pain to a person
[3:13:28] not to the church
[3:13:31] why because tithe is not the farms used
[3:13:33] for church building
[3:13:36] tight is not used for innovation of the
[3:13:38] church
[3:13:40] is not used for uh
[3:13:42] helping the the
[3:13:44] you know
[3:13:46] you know the needy
[3:13:47] you know stuff like that
[3:13:49] life
[3:13:50] is supposed the person who chooses what
[3:13:53] to use tight for is the past
[3:13:56] whether it is
[3:13:58] 1000
[3:13:59] or 1000 million
[3:14:01] okay that's why
[3:14:03] churches that have bigger congregations
[3:14:06] do like the past i can feel
[3:14:08] laid spend
[3:14:10] some of the money on humanitarian works
[3:14:14] or on helping ministers and stuff things
[3:14:16] like that
[3:14:17] because they can't use all that money
[3:14:18] for themselves they pay the costs they
[3:14:20] decide to buy private jets
[3:14:22] because they have very many members and
[3:14:24] all they are paying their taxes they
[3:14:25] have a lot of money they buy private
[3:14:27] jets that shows you the difference
[3:14:29] between the messaging ministers
[3:14:30] believers and
[3:14:34] and the denominations
[3:14:35] but tight is paid to your pastor
[3:14:38] your pastor
[3:14:39] and of course you can give it
[3:14:42] when you are giving tithing out
[3:14:43] an offering back just throw it there
[3:14:46] unless it has written only tight and we
[3:14:48] haven't
[3:14:50] you know you can just put a level of
[3:14:52] some very well and you know put tight or
[3:14:55] your name on it or whatever you throw it
[3:14:57] there
[3:14:58] why so that when the person receives it
[3:15:01] he knows oh it's brother son okay then
[3:15:03] i'll pray for the son
[3:15:04] but if he receives it no name on it okay
[3:15:07] fine i'll pray for whoever gave
[3:15:09] whichever yes
[3:15:21] if you want to just drop it fine
[3:15:24] yes
[3:15:34] okay if someone pays their tithe in the
[3:15:37] church without knowing
[3:15:40] that means that person is not is not
[3:15:42] around enough he's not even a believer
[3:15:43] in the message
[3:15:45] because all believers of the message no
[3:15:47] they pay their tithe to their masters
[3:15:50] yes
[3:15:52] yes
[3:15:55] that's not your business
[3:15:57] yeah but i pay my type first of all
[3:15:59] where do you put your tithe
[3:16:03] no no where do you put your tie
[3:16:06] to the lord
[3:16:08] okay
[3:16:10] you must have that intention that
[3:16:11] mindset i pay i entice the lord but i
[3:16:15] give it to the pastor
[3:16:17] where the pastor takes it but the bible
[3:16:19] says however however uses it that's
[3:16:20] planning your business but you have
[3:16:22] taken to the lord actually when it seems
[3:16:24] that he must pray for you
[3:16:26] must pray and receive it in the name of
[3:16:28] the lord right
[3:16:30] these are bible principles like i said
[3:16:33] we're going to have a service and we
[3:16:34] shall preach on this
[3:16:35] the pastors also type
[3:16:37] they
[3:16:38] they show thanks to the lord just like
[3:16:40] you ties to the lord
[3:16:41] okay so
[3:16:42] thank you like i said i will have an
[3:16:45] exposition on this preaching on this and
[3:16:47] talk about all those areas that i know
[3:16:48] of concern but the the type
[3:16:51] money must be for the work of the
[3:16:53] ministry
[3:16:55] for the minister why to the pastor
[3:16:57] because your pastor passes on who feeds
[3:16:59] you spiritual food spiritual manner that
[3:17:01] are far you paint him
[3:17:04] but pastor doesn't walk alone usually he
[3:17:06] has other ministers right in the chat so
[3:17:09] if they are not working or how do they
[3:17:11] live there you just come and join the
[3:17:13] weather man and then you go how are they
[3:17:14] living
[3:17:16] so then the pastor also usually supports
[3:17:19] them so but like i said we will go we're
[3:17:22] going to have this exposition in this
[3:17:25] i'm realizing there are many questions
[3:17:26] on trans i didn't know i didn't expect
[3:17:28] that so we need to talk about that we
[3:17:30] need to talk about still something
[3:17:33] okay
[3:17:36] um
[3:17:56] hmm
[3:18:18] whoever is
[3:18:28] um
[3:18:42] yes
[3:18:44] how did they
[3:18:48] was william branham only from
[3:18:52] where was william bannon from
[3:18:55] where was martin from
[3:19:00] where was uh
[3:19:03] iranians from
[3:19:06] where was paul from
[3:19:11] where where was
[3:19:14] martin luther from
[3:19:19] yes and where was uh
[3:19:21] uh
[3:19:23] huh
[3:19:27] where where is it from
[3:19:30] weasley wesley was from europe was from
[3:19:34] uk
[3:19:35] england
[3:19:38] yeah
[3:19:40] now did you see that all these messages
[3:19:43] came from different
[3:19:44] areas and
[3:19:46] yet their message
[3:19:48] was able to move
[3:19:49] because you see god begins like like
[3:19:55] you can you you start a fire here about
[3:19:57] fire but it goes i don't have to start
[3:20:00] in every spot at bushfire the one who
[3:20:03] suddenly hears that which goes all
[3:20:04] across the field
[3:20:06] so when god sets a message that's why it
[3:20:08] takes a time a period of time because it
[3:20:10] has to move to everyday
[3:20:13] everyone has to receive that message of
[3:20:15] that generation who was intended to have
[3:20:17] this eternal life
[3:20:18] so
[3:20:20] that's what happened at that time and
[3:20:22] that's what will happen even in our time
[3:20:26] the message the message moves
[3:20:30] sometimes
[3:20:31] it's not packed off by of course
[3:20:34] the revelation of the word is packed up
[3:20:35] by a man but the holy spirit fires still
[3:20:38] are lit in all those areas somehow for
[3:20:41] people to receive a revival of the world
[3:20:43] in their time
[3:20:47] yes
[3:20:48] i hope that will be the last one
[3:21:00] you wanted to be a politician
[3:21:10] i have been a prefect i was a religious
[3:21:12] prefect
[3:21:13] twice in high school and higher school
[3:21:17] i was a religious prefect
[3:21:20] i believe on those things you should
[3:21:21] pray for them
[3:21:24] because
[3:21:25] in such a level i don't think it would
[3:21:26] be harmful
[3:21:28] why because i don't think it can uh
[3:21:33] it will influence you away from the
[3:21:35] world but i believe it can give you a
[3:21:38] position of influence over the students
[3:21:40] to give them the word like i did with me
[3:21:42] it also depends on your intentions what
[3:21:44] you do with it
[3:21:45] me when i was a religious prefect i was
[3:21:49] first of all there was nothing that
[3:21:51] why don't why do we say this kind of
[3:21:53] believers from going into politics
[3:21:54] because by the ban i'm saying it is
[3:21:55] rotten
[3:21:57] his point is at school also rotten
[3:22:00] no
[3:22:00] i never bribed students to elect me no
[3:22:04] but if you go to university politics it
[3:22:06] becomes something else
[3:22:07] you see universal politics is rotten
[3:22:10] almost like they are the rest of it you
[3:22:12] know most of the those guild presidents
[3:22:14] you find that uh they are also connected
[3:22:16] to a political party and you know they
[3:22:18] have you know really rotten so
[3:22:20] it depends on the circumstances but
[3:22:23] the bottom line is
[3:22:25] what is your intention in it
[3:22:28] number two
[3:22:29] is it a law that believers don't do
[3:22:31] politics no it is not
[3:22:33] three is it a sin
[3:22:35] no it is not many things are not seen
[3:22:38] although
[3:22:40] because support says all things are not
[3:22:42] lawful to me but all things are not
[3:22:43] expedient
[3:22:44] so it's not a sin for you but
[3:22:47] will it keep you
[3:22:49] connected
[3:22:51] serving christ the way you are
[3:22:53] will it keep you close to the lord
[3:22:55] will it will it compromise you or not
[3:22:58] with the other questions you have to ask
[3:22:59] yourself and then you pray about it and
[3:23:02] let the horse be designed that in you
[3:23:04] so that's what i would say and i think
[3:23:07] that summarizes it
[3:23:25] you have been a
[3:23:28] joke yes
[3:23:30] it was that thus saith the lord
[3:23:34] god says god judges his own prophets you
[3:23:38] dare know that the prophet of god
[3:23:41] god
[3:23:43] told jose expressly as a prophet
[3:23:47] don't come and tell us god told you
[3:23:49] because you're not a prophet
[3:23:52] you understand
[3:23:54] so god
[3:23:55] and it was implicating the condition of
[3:23:58] israel
[3:24:00] how israel was that's how also that
[3:24:02] woman was a prostitute israel had become
[3:24:04] a prostitute
[3:24:05] maybe
[3:24:06] preach about that also one day so
[3:24:09] you're not a prophet like hosea number
[3:24:11] one number two got all hosea number
[3:24:14] three
[3:24:15] it was for the purpose of the it was i
[3:24:18] had a message for israel
[3:24:20] and many other reasons
[3:24:22] but
[3:24:23] also i'll tell you another person who
[3:24:25] married a prostitute that was king ahab
[3:24:28] was god happy with him
[3:24:30] so
[3:24:31] so you said the outcome of it when he
[3:24:33] married jezebel jesus became a
[3:24:35] destruction actually the prophet of god
[3:24:37] rebuked her he said you referred to the
[3:24:39] dogs
[3:24:40] so that's not a standard that you want
[3:24:42] to use to say that
[3:24:44] a son was that a jew must marry a jew
[3:24:48] a christian must marry
[3:24:51] yeah
[3:24:52] so he doesn't actually
[3:24:54] jose did you unreally didn't want it he
[3:24:57] said oh god why certainly do it
[3:25:00] so that's not what he was he wasn't a
[3:25:02] prostitute he was god
[3:25:05] it was god telling me
[3:25:08] praise the lord amen
[3:25:12] let us pray
[3:25:14] precious loving jesus we thank you so
[3:25:16] much for the time you have given to us
[3:25:17] to share your work today we give you
[3:25:19] praise one and glory
[3:25:21] further some questions that i've been
[3:25:22] asked and shared here i pray oh god that
[3:25:25] your word will be able to sink into our
[3:25:26] hearts we shall be able to know you more
[3:25:29] that shall be close to you father that
[3:25:30] we shall overcome especially these young
[3:25:35] really want to people they want to be
[3:25:36] close to you they want to see you and to
