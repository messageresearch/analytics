[18:31] if anyone is not serious we shall
[18:33] seriously exclude them from this
[18:35] discussion
[18:36] because we do not want to be unserious

[21:29] okay uh i hope you said one other and
[21:32] further too that is
[21:33] money that means that uh i see your
[21:36] network is not very good as usual
[21:39] uh maybe you have changed location uh
[21:41] but if you are not hearing make sure you
[21:43] hear
[21:44] us so you are sitting in a place where
[21:45] you can be able to hear well
[21:47] okay so who have i not asked that i need
[21:49] to ask brother
[21:51] paulica where are you
[21:54] 115. so you have been asleep at this
[21:56] time
[21:57] you have been reading slower slowly
[22:01] you've been reading other books oh you
[22:03] finished adoption
[22:05] not yet i saw they were seriously they
[22:08] they took two books and they're gonna
[22:10] finish it in one night that's that is it
[22:12] i love that uh brother marvin where have
[22:16] you reached
[22:21] 110 okay now it seems
[22:26] in the political that's where you
[22:27] reached where are you
[22:34] you are that's one of the things
[22:38] so which means you you are just on this
[22:41] man
[22:43] okay but uh you should have done better
[22:45] than that right
[22:49] how far
[22:52] the
[23:06] brothership you are better quiet as if
[23:09] you approached the world
[23:10] but how far have you gone
[23:15] 119. 119
[23:18] because you already wished
[23:29] so there are others that have not
[23:30] finished completed the second chapter
[23:33] even on the
[23:33] invasion church age they've been reading
[23:36] other books
[23:37] so those of you have not even you know
[23:39] finished
[23:41] you know this chapter i think we all
[23:43] have only one among us
[23:45] you can now see that we are really left
[23:47] behind
[23:48] that is not acceptable our local down is
[23:51] about to get over
[23:53] and uh i do not know if we shall
[23:56] continue to get such a chance
[23:58] to study like this of course when
[24:02] lockdown is over we we
[24:04] we we're going to go but some of you are
[24:05] going to go back to schools
[24:07] and uh you're going to go back into
[24:09] another atmosphere
[24:11] and maybe you you may even put your chat
[24:13] edit book
[24:15] on under the pillow that is if you go
[24:18] with it
[24:19] you know others may even forget where
[24:21] you have thrown it
[24:23] so really i am suggesting and proposing
[24:28] that you you use make use of your time
[24:31] as a matter of fact you if i were you i
[24:33] wouldn't even do
[24:34] what brother o'kara suggested for to us
[24:37] to read
[24:38] according to proportion i would read the
[24:39] whole book finish it
[24:41] and then come back and then be reading
[24:44] whichever part we're going to be
[24:45] covering at that time you understand so
[24:47] by the time
[24:48] you go to school you have nothing to
[24:50] lose you have finished the whole book
[24:51] and
[24:51] you have already asked all your
[24:52] questions that you need to ask and you
[24:54] know what you really believe
[24:56] you've had a strong sister will sing
[24:58] that song or do you want me to play it
[25:00] again
[25:01] the tears you will cry again when you
[25:03] are you are left from the rapture you
[25:04] cry them now you cry them now
[25:07] time is is coming when people will cry
[25:09] those years
[25:10] time is coming when those people will
[25:12] now will now say oh god let me be
[25:14] spiritual let me say all the
[25:15] world
[25:16] oh god i've now remembered i have to
[25:18] really be serious with you
[25:19] oh lord even if it is reading the church
[25:21] edible if all i have to do is read the
[25:23] church
[25:24] to go the rapture let me do it at least
[25:26] in 72 hours long or even at least in two
[25:28] to two hours i can do it i can make it
[25:30] i'm sure
[25:32] you know those prayers cannot help you
[25:34] at that time because the rapture will
[25:35] already
[25:36] happen so please let us be serious
[25:40] use your time when you have it don't
[25:43] you know don't wait when it is too late
[25:46] this message is not for the for the
[25:49] people out there this message is for us
[25:53] there are people out there who don't
[25:54] know even this message
[25:56] but whatever you know they have really
[25:58] studied it they have really learned it
[26:00] they really know it too well that you
[26:03] believe the message don't even know what
[26:04] you believe
[26:05] but yet they know what they believe
[26:07] because the younger people are too lazy
[26:09] the other people are too weak i tell you
[26:11] that
[26:13] i'm sorry to speak in this way but
[26:15] generally speaking
[26:16] young people in the message they are too
[26:18] lazy to read a
[26:20] message too lazy then you wonder
[26:23] if the our fathers who came in before us
[26:26] were also lazy like us would we even
[26:30] be having anyone to preach to us anymore
[26:33] do you know you are the preachers of a
[26:36] few years to come into our terrace
[26:39] so how are you going to be preaching and
[26:41] telling others to read when you yourself
[26:42] never read
[26:44] it it's going to be a shame it's going
[26:45] to be a shame so
[26:47] i'm encouraging you to take this serious
[26:50] read the message seriously be sincere
[26:55] i remember when i was still in school i
[26:58] saw this someone here who did
[27:00] what i did i i would take a friend
[27:03] this friend of mine did not even believe
[27:05] the message at that time
[27:07] i would take him we go somewhere i tell
[27:09] him you know what
[27:10] i have something very sweet that i want
[27:12] to read for you i'll just read about you
[27:14] only two pages and then we can now
[27:15] revise the books
[27:17] so we would go this would of course be
[27:20] now
[27:20] after our preps so we have to sleep but
[27:22] now instead of selecting i'll tell you
[27:24] before we sleep let us go and read up
[27:26] these
[27:26] two pages we will take message books
[27:28] like i remember there is a message book
[27:30] we do
[27:30] titled why are we not at the nomination
[27:34] that one i'll never forget it so i took
[27:37] it
[27:38] and i told him let me read because i
[27:39] wanted him to see the differences
[27:41] of what i believe and the the the church
[27:44] he was in
[27:46] so i started reading when i finished the
[27:48] first page i went on the second on the
[27:50] last
[27:50] page which is the second page i promise
[27:52] that i'll read only two pages
[27:54] and by the time i finish the second
[27:55] independently you know what
[27:57] please continue i said okay no problem i
[27:59] continued
[28:01] i i i opened i kept on flick flipping
[28:04] the pages that he was him telling me my
[28:05] that is nice continuously
[28:07] god anointed me in such a way that i was
[28:09] reading it and he was so sweet in his
[28:11] yeah
[28:12] so he joined me please continue a bit
[28:14] continue and preach
[28:15] and guess what we think we want to
[28:16] finish the church in the on only one
[28:19] night
[28:19] about two hours i'm not the church but
[28:23] why are we not that denomination we will
[28:25] finish it just like that
[28:27] because the thing was true that we
[28:28] continued reading reading reading

[28:33] your tune is reading
[28:35] some people are not good at reading you

[28:38] you know we have all these things on top
[28:40] many of you have messaged prayers even
[28:41] those who don't

[28:51] are following you know
[28:53] me i love listening i put on and then i
[28:55] just follow you know

[28:59] something or just to
[29:01] reason on something i underline it i
[29:03] have to pause the play

[33:39] respect and to abel
[33:40] and jesus came
[33:44] and she is offering he had no respect
[33:47] but
[33:47] one which is k was evil
[33:55] [Music]
[34:02] the same parents they were the twins of
[34:05] isaac
[34:08] one was the elect of god and the other
[34:10] was your prophet
[34:12] both worshiped one in every single case
[34:16] there was worship of god involved
[34:19] in every case the demolition the writers
[34:23] and persecuted the writers in some cases
[34:26] that they would destroy their ideas
[34:29] but notice they were planted together
[34:32] they live together they both made claims
[34:35] upon whether not
[34:37] okay now before we continue
[34:41] i uh i'd like to ask a question
[34:46] amen sister
[34:48] [Applause]
[34:50] i was going to ask to call the other
[34:51] name but i know i always mess it up so
[34:53] sister burgers
[34:54] how much have you read
[34:59] yo have you finished this ma the
[35:01] efficient age
[35:03] okay now i would like to ask a question
[35:06] to all of us
[35:07] all of you yes uh how can you remember
[35:11] why the church edge book is different
[35:12] from all the other message books we have
[35:18] yes go ahead
[35:21] uh okay since you're already in the
[35:24] highlight yeah
[35:25] because the prophet you also tried to
[35:28] put up your voice a bit
[35:29] the prophet allowed other people to
[35:33] correct the vocabulary and to edit it
[35:40] is that expressed perfectly
[35:43] this is stuff this is uh uh uh this is a
[35:46] question that says no so you you want
[35:48] to tell us why why the touch edge book
[35:52] is different from all the other
[35:53] messaging books we have
[35:56] um brother are you if this uh
[35:58] highlighted people were always going to
[35:59] talk so you understand their needs
[36:01] perhaps
[36:04] okay but yes brother son
[36:10] because
[36:24] keeps adding the chain
[36:27] putting some
[36:32] passes and vocabulary
[36:37] but that one is not a perfect
[36:39] explanation
[36:40] it's the same thing that brother
[36:41] polycarp said but it's not a perfect
[36:44] explanation yes not that i'm not i'm not
[36:47] appreciating it but i'm i'm saying that
[36:49] it's more missing
[36:50] more to say okay yes brother joe yeah
[37:01] okay now you're coming but what they're
[37:04] saying what can you say about it
[37:06] what they say
[37:09] yes what they were already answering do
[37:11] you have anything you want to say about
[37:12] it
[37:14] no ok
[37:18] dragon is yes
[37:35] we are not uh saying no but also that
[37:38] answer i we need to
[37:39] spice it up a little bit because when
[37:41] you just say someone edited it's like as
[37:42] if someone came and
[37:43] put their own ideas uh so yes brother
[38:16] and where do you get that from
[38:20] so you mean you do not need the
[38:22] regulation of the whole speed when you
[38:23] are dealing with the rest of the
[38:25] message books
[38:29] so did he also write the rest of the
[38:30] messages
[38:33] that's the part about what i was looking
[38:34] for okay
[38:36] we are coming back to that but uh people
[38:38] hold it there
[38:39] but i love it you have something else
[38:41] you want to say
[38:57] elaborated more
[39:13] is to underline the parts which are
[39:17] which have questions and the prophet
[39:21] he sat down and tried to explain
[39:25] those parts which are
[39:38] and so can you compare this church
[39:42] edible with the rest of the messaging
[39:44] books that we have
[39:49] that's that was the initial question how
[39:51] different is it
[39:53] from the other message books so did
[39:56] brother
[39:56] also write the other books yes
[40:01] okay yes yes can you can you also give
[40:04] me your submission
[40:08] write them brother he was recognized
[40:12] just transcribed into the platform
[40:18] but yeah but about the title he read
[40:22] to reference
[40:32] to put the language straight into a
[40:35] language that
[40:35] the land people would
[40:40] all right now the last two people
[40:43] including all of you
[40:45] have given us some substantial
[40:47] information
[40:48] i would like to say this again that we
[40:50] can understand because sometimes
[40:52] we we forget to understand what this is
[40:55] all about
[40:57] you have this church right yes
[41:01] brother banham was not educated as we
[41:04] all might think
[41:06] he was a seventh grade student so he was
[41:09] not a doctor of theology don't expect
[41:10] him to start going to write books
[41:12] he never did write books he actually
[41:15] never did
[41:17] maybe he's attract he wrote some quite a
[41:20] bit earlier in his years
[41:22] i don't remember the title but it was
[41:24] about divine healing and things like
[41:25] that
[41:27] all the message books we have can you
[41:29] give me some samples
[41:34] oh you don't even know yeah
[41:37] come on give me give me okay there is
[41:40] this one
[41:41] why it had to be shepherd
[41:44] give me another
[41:48] come on yeah you can see already people
[41:50] are really doing
[41:51] quite a lot of business and reading okay
[41:54] this
[41:54] the other one that one this one was
[41:57] printed can you
[41:58] bring one that we do here this one was
[42:00] printed by uh
[42:02] uh by uh brother
[42:06] oh i'm forgetting the name about in
[42:09] south africa
[42:11] over there in south africa is that who
[42:13] printed this
[42:15] and uh they just said this recently okay
[42:18] then this one was created by voice of
[42:20] god recordings
[42:24] everlasting life and how to receive it
[42:28] you see then this one also splits by
[42:31] voice of god recordings
[42:33] absorption it seems
[42:37] this is a series of
[42:40] messages and there is something that
[42:44] uh i'd like
[42:48] someone to read for me you see this
[42:51] yes what's going behind there
[42:55] this is the first time for
[43:08] [Music]
[43:25] from the map from the magnetic check
[43:27] recordings
[43:29] to the printed page and are printed
[43:32] here in and updated
[43:36] and distributed by the voice of god
[43:43] means it is not changed
[43:47] it's not touched what was spoken on the
[43:49] magnetic tape
[43:50] what was preached on verbal
[43:54] it is exactly what was put there that's
[43:56] why the other daughter said it is a
[43:57] transcription it's all right
[43:59] a transcription you don't change
[44:00] anything just like the things i'm
[44:02] speaking now
[44:03] you record it and then you you sit down
[44:05] you hear me talking and you
[44:07] write what i will say what are these
[44:08] messenger books these ones we do here
[44:11] all these messaging books you know are
[44:14] transcriptions of the words of the
[44:17] preaching that balabana was preaching
[44:19] that's why when you say i want to read
[44:30] inspiration with which he gave this
[44:32] message why
[44:34] number one he preached this message
[44:37] probably
[44:37] in one hour and a half or even less this
[44:40] one message
[44:41] and here you take it and listen and read
[44:43] it for one month
[44:45] you read one page you keep you read one
[44:47] page you keep you will never get the
[44:49] inspiration
[44:51] you need to sit down and play the team
[44:53] the best
[44:54] for you to understand and get the
[44:56] inspiration you need to sit down
[44:57] play that tape and not brother but
[44:59] listen and say i will continue listening
[45:01] now tomorrow
[45:02] no if you're in a service do you work
[45:04] out no
[45:06] are you kidding me yes what are you
[45:08] doing in a service
[45:10] you sit down you listen to the service
[45:13] you say amen you take your nuts you get
[45:17] up
[45:18] after you've been blessed so in the same
[45:20] way
[45:21] these messages are preached and not
[45:24] always
[45:24] let it be a culture you know that
[45:26] whenever you're going to read a message
[45:28] you give yourself time okay don't pick
[45:31] one
[45:32] big move and so i'm going to read this
[45:33] one now and finish it no
[45:35] depending on the time you have you
[45:37] planned yourself
[45:39] this morning i don't have much time
[45:41] about one hour or so in the morning
[45:42] what i'll pick a small book perhaps
[45:44] maybe like a everlasting life and how to
[45:46] receive it this is quite small
[45:48] you can read it within a one hour or
[45:51] less
[45:52] okay how many can do that
[45:56] okay how many can read in 30 minutes
[46:09] look you can wait too fast
[46:12] but maybe when you're not understanding
[46:14] also yes it is good to read
[46:16] if you preach it for one hour and a half
[46:18] since it is ready you can read it for
[46:20] two hours or an hour about 40 minutes
[46:23] you understand yes in order for you to
[46:26] fully understand
[46:27] what it is that is being propagated but
[46:29] if you are listening you listen for
[46:31] exact time
[46:32] he was preaching what are you saying
[46:35] is better because when you listen you
[46:37] receive more
[46:38] it's always good to listen i better
[46:40] listen
[46:54] yes see every page is under oh my i love
[46:57] this
[46:58] don't you have it let's look at that
[47:03] just look at that every page is on the
[47:06] right
[47:08] oh i just love this now
[47:11] is it before i put on an ipad that's how
[47:13] i used to do also in my books but
[47:15] nowadays
[47:16] i have ipad i just highlight them you
[47:18] know technology
[47:19] is improving every time but we
[47:22] we just the issue is listen and read the
[47:24] message that's the most important thing
[47:26] okay success love this brother is very
[47:29] very serious
[47:29] oh my the whole book is nothing with his
[47:32] brain which means
[47:33] which means that oh most of these things
[47:35] are written in that
[47:51] [Music]
[48:01] [Music]
[48:15] he has written in his book and
[48:18] exposition
[48:26] he has already preached if you want to
[48:28] hear those messages he preached
[48:30] he he we
[48:47] but in each message he was dealing with
[48:50] with the
[48:50] with the one thing one thing one thing
[48:52] you understand but now when it comes to
[48:54] the church edible
[48:56] it's not only does someone's edited
[48:59] in perfect grammar grammar
[49:02] okay not everything the teaching but
[49:05] everything there
[49:06] rama please hold that in your heart not
[49:09] only
[49:10] is the grammar edited but also
[49:14] new teachings
[49:18] are put in this booklet that we are not
[49:22] in those original
[49:23] preached summons when i said mutations i
[49:26] don't mean like he knew that from the
[49:27] teaching of alabama but actually
[49:29] i mean that they're teaching their
[49:31] speech to earth like the serpent's seat
[49:33] yes he if now he's the one who are
[49:35] healing me that's why i wanted us to
[49:36] i understand this because you'll be like
[49:38] we are starting to church ages now how
[49:40] does the supremacy become
[49:41] here you have to understand like the
[49:44] suffering see
[49:45] like about one god yeah you understand
[49:50] so many of these teachings are
[49:52] incorporated
[49:54] in this book and actually all the
[49:57] majorities of the message
[49:58] are in here
[50:02] so if someone says why do people believe
[50:04] giving this book
[50:05] if he's a serious person if he reads it
[50:08] you will know everything we believe
[50:10] if you read it you will know everything
[50:12] you preach yes
[50:13] by the way let me tell you never call
[50:16] yourself a message
[50:17] if you don't know what the message
[50:18] preaches the whole thing not some of it
[50:21] the whole thing
[50:22] me when i believe the message i was on
[50:24] fire
[50:25] to know everything that they wanted to
[50:27] preach
[50:28] everything i was in my church and they
[50:31] talk about the rapture like this
[50:33] what does the message say about the
[50:34] rapture i was there and they talked
[50:36] about the
[50:37] three four six what does the message say
[50:38] about triple six do you understand
[50:40] i was there and they said they were
[50:42] saying
[50:44] i was there and they were telling us to
[50:46] come before the priest and we confess
[50:48] our sins
[50:49] what does the message say about how is
[50:52] it called in
[50:53] in english that confession is this
[50:56] really confession the sacrament is
[50:58] called one itself
[51:01] no no no no no no no no
[51:06] yes
[51:09] yeah yes you see what was the message
[51:13] you know i i was there and they told uh
[51:16] you know these are how they
[51:17] uh you know how many know about
[51:20] evolution evolution er
[51:24] different evolution what does the theory
[51:27] of the evolution mistake
[51:34] is
[51:47] animals wow and and then what happened
[51:51] how come they're human beings now it's
[51:53] it continues on huh
[52:16] what
[52:27] until now we became perfect human beings
[52:30] so through the fives how many of you are
[52:32] teaching
[52:33] how many did not know hey
[52:37] that is what i was teaching did you know
[52:40] that
[52:41] i know you i think you are a
[52:42] statistician
[52:53] [Music]
[52:58] and slowly by slowly the tail broke off
[53:01] slowly by slowly this thing kind of
[53:03] broke off with the defector
[53:05] the fat the fires broke over there and
[53:08] the horns also brought off and then
[53:10] eventually
[53:12] the
[53:27] that that was their conclusion but what
[53:29] does the message say about that
[53:32] if it is the editorial message it must
[53:35] have
[53:35] a final conclusion let me tell you
[53:38] if this message we are preaching is the
[53:40] end time message it
[53:42] must have a conclusion on every major
[53:44] matter in the world for your information
[53:46] you know why
[53:47] because the end time prophet will be
[53:50] sent by god fulfill revelation 10
[53:52] and 7. what does it say without reading
[53:56] you of course
[54:00] from the beginning but uh-huh
[54:06] yes brother but in the days
[54:20] but in the days of the voice
[54:33] he says the mystery of girls
[54:40] god bless you hallelujah what is the
[54:42] mystery of god
[54:44] the mystery of god is god himself what
[54:46] he has hidden within him
[54:47] right the mystery of god is the mystery
[54:50] of his will
[54:51] and the mystery of god is the word
[54:54] itself and a veil
[54:55] everything that was never understood
[54:57] every question that man has ever had
[55:00] the the last day prophet the end time
[55:03] you wrap the key
[55:04] to unlock all those mysteries hallelujah
[55:08] and uh yes yes
[55:12] have we heard this message yes have we
[55:14] believed this message
[55:29] why because this message
[55:33] at the is of god yes the conclusion of
[55:36] god
[55:36] before he takes the break in the night
[55:39] so
[55:40] talk any type of topic you want to talk
[55:41] about let me hear your topics
[55:44] one water baptism
[55:47] the conclusion is in the message
[55:49] marriage
[55:50] yes it is amazing that the youngest is
[55:53] not to talk about you
[55:54] but marriage the conclusion is in the
[55:56] message yes
[55:58] trinity the conclusion is right here
[56:02] [Music]
[56:42] yes
[57:11] i tell you don't ever think that you
[57:14] will get
[57:15] something in the message and something's
[57:17] out of the message
[57:18] if you are that kind you may not last in
[57:21] this message
[57:24] salvation
[57:34] all that you need to be prosperous in
[57:37] this life and to be prosperous in the
[57:40] world to come
[57:41] is in this message if the message is the
[57:44] word of god
[57:45] then everything we need is right there
[57:48] what is the message
[57:49] here's what i always say what is your
[57:52] bible
[58:05] you know okay oh yes yes sister
[58:09] i can see you oh she said you don't have
[58:11] my bible
[58:12] what is your ass please hold it up
[58:18] someone is holding up a black book
[58:33] do you know all the denominations have
[58:34] bibles
[58:38] yes
[58:42] so why do you think you are different
[58:44] from them
[58:52] [Music]
[59:07] [Music]
[59:13] this message is a higher regulation than
[59:15] what is in the denominations
[59:17] but they also have the same
[59:20] do you know now you with this variable
[59:23] you will also
[59:24] understand if you have a problem with
[59:27] your
[59:27] eyes and the difference is too big that
[59:30] you remove your eye glasses
[59:32] as much as you have your bible can you
[59:34] read it very well
[59:36] can you why
[59:40] because you need to apply
[59:41] [Music]
[59:43] you need to apply glasses when your
[59:45] progress is you are comfortable number
[59:47] one number two
[59:49] you can see where number three you can
[59:51] drink you can read
[59:53] and you can know you understand yes
[59:56] so now the message
[59:59] this book we are starting these books we
[1:00:02] are reading the topics we are hearing
[1:00:04] is the ideas
[1:00:08] when you don't have it you can't even
[1:00:11] get your bibles because if you
[1:00:12] you don't have anything because you
[1:00:14] can't understand it
[1:00:15] but when you bring the message you read
[1:00:17] through it
[1:00:19] it is going to be your filter now to be
[1:00:21] able to understand the message
[1:00:23] and people the problem they have leaving
[1:00:25] the life of this message is because
[1:00:27] when they were in the denominations
[1:00:29] there they were
[1:00:30] reading the bible in the filter of the
[1:00:33] of those
[1:00:34] denominational teachings so when you now
[1:00:36] give them the
[1:00:37] message it is very hard for them why
[1:00:40] because they
[1:00:41] think that is still those things maybe
[1:00:43] if they were in the world or they did
[1:00:45] not know the lord or the word
[1:00:47] or they were catholic so they were you
[1:00:48] understand so when you
[1:00:50] whenever you read a scripture for them
[1:00:51] they may even shout a man but actually
[1:00:53] they are shouting a man to the that they
[1:00:55] had the understanding that they
[1:00:57] absolutely think that they have
[1:00:59] but thank god when we come to this
[1:01:01] knowledge of the truth
[1:01:02] we receive another filter the filter of
[1:01:04] the world which is
[1:01:06] god himself because this message is
[1:01:07] christ himself coming down
[1:01:09] because remember that star was in his
[1:01:10] hands you know and
[1:01:12] it is him who is giving life to that
[1:01:14] star so that
[1:01:15] that right can illuminate us also so
[1:01:18] that we can be able to understand
[1:01:20] what god wants us to understand so we
[1:01:22] can be able to see
[1:01:23] what god wants us to see can we now go
[1:01:27] back to the church
[1:01:29] having understood all goals then now we
[1:01:33] can be able
[1:01:34] to know
[1:01:40] speak of all these things in uh
[1:01:44] you know uh and right here now he's
[1:01:46] talking about kane and the aber
[1:01:47] and kenji that wicked one and he says
[1:01:51] that uh
[1:01:51] again there are two children from the
[1:01:53] flesh of the saint parents
[1:01:55] uh for some reason you're not giving me
[1:01:56] those buses but isaac but uh
[1:01:58] i think you were meant to and there were
[1:02:00] two children from the
[1:02:02] from of this the same parents
[1:02:05] they were the twins of isaac and rebecca
[1:02:08] and one under one was the elect of god
[1:02:11] and the other was
[1:02:13] both worshiped god in every single case
[1:02:15] there was worship of god involved
[1:02:17] in every case the evil hated the writers
[1:02:19] and persecuted the righteous
[1:02:21] in in some cases the evil destroyed the
[1:02:23] righteous
[1:02:24] but not just they were granted
[1:02:27] together they lived only foreign
[1:02:47] do you know that even if any prophets
[1:02:49] are going to make a claim of god do you
[1:02:50] know that
[1:02:51] they will make a claim of god but that
[1:02:53] does not necessarily mean
[1:02:55] that god is actually
[1:02:58] hearing or respecting their suffering
[1:03:02] his uh their sacrifices
[1:03:05] okay who is reading the next paragraph
[1:03:08] these illustrations depict
[1:03:11] perfectly this illustration
[1:03:14] perfectly the parable of the lord jesus
[1:03:16] christ
[1:03:17] when he said that the kingdom of heaven
[1:03:19] was like until a man who sowed
[1:03:22] good saved only to have an enemy come
[1:03:24] and plant
[1:03:25] tears amongst amongst those good sins
[1:03:29] what did not plant that certain
[1:03:31] plantations
[1:03:32] there's right amongst the good seeds of
[1:03:35] food
[1:03:35] those two kinds of plants in tobacco's
[1:03:38] people
[1:03:39] from two different seeds grew up
[1:03:41] together they particularly
[1:03:42] the nourishment in the same earth they
[1:03:46] shared in the same
[1:03:47] sign and all other benefits and both
[1:03:51] harvested in their time do you see it
[1:03:55] don't ever forget these truths
[1:03:58] as we study the church edges and later
[1:04:00] they say hallelujah
[1:04:03] did you get the point the major point
[1:04:04] there before before did you get another
[1:04:07] point there
[1:04:08] what's the major point
[1:04:21] your salvation please what is happening
[1:04:24] in that chapter
[1:04:28] you are sitting very very fast today huh
[1:04:32] i don't know why uh-huh what
[1:04:35] what's happening
[1:04:45] okay and what happens after that
[1:04:54] yes
[1:05:01] the two different states grew together
[1:05:09] uh-huh
[1:05:13] come on now i need someone else to give
[1:05:15] a know
[1:05:17] what do i understand by that question
[1:05:31] but they all receive the same rain and
[1:05:34] everything
[1:05:35] but what is different is the word
[1:05:44] but they all receive that same
[1:05:46] everything and go together
[1:05:50] okay now what when you say they all
[1:05:54] receive the same everything and go
[1:05:56] together
[1:05:56] what do they receive
[1:06:17] we might fail to understand
[1:06:20] he was talking about seeds
[1:06:24] and he says that they
[1:06:30] also
[1:06:47] these illustrations depict perfectly the
[1:06:50] parable of the lord jesus christ
[1:06:52] when he said that the kingdom of heaven
[1:06:54] was like
[1:06:55] a man who so would sit
[1:06:59] only to have an enemy come and plant
[1:07:01] stairs amongst those good seats
[1:07:04] where did not plant the tears saturn
[1:07:07] planted downstairs
[1:07:09] right amongst the good sea of gold
[1:07:13] those two kind there's two kinds of
[1:07:15] plants
[1:07:17] before from two different seeds
[1:07:20] grow up together how many types of
[1:07:23] plants
[1:07:25] two that was followed by
[1:07:40] in the same earth
[1:07:43] you know this is the spiritual language
[1:07:45] now
[1:07:46] yes yeah those ones who did not love
[1:07:49] math
[1:07:50] here it goes back again to math because
[1:07:53] you have to know what stands for
[1:07:58] x stands for this and y
[1:08:02] stands for this so you have to
[1:08:03] understand this spiritual language
[1:08:08] someone would read these things
[1:08:12] he's talking about his sins it's not
[1:08:14] about chaos it's talking about
[1:08:16] that i can't understand these things
[1:08:18] it's not confusing even as a matter of
[1:08:20] fact
[1:08:20] i even feel headache in this thing why
[1:08:24] because you are not tuned
[1:08:27] because you are not entered into the
[1:08:29] spirit you remember
[1:08:30] we talked about where you need the
[1:08:32] spirit so if you
[1:08:34] want to understand these things you have
[1:08:35] to be entered into the spirit of real
[1:08:37] fast
[1:08:38] yes before you start even reading it so
[1:08:41] what is talking about
[1:08:43] the seeds one was burnt by god those are
[1:08:46] the one people the seed of god right
[1:08:48] yes and then another one was planted
[1:09:05] right yes so that that seed also was
[1:09:08] there so we
[1:09:09] we now have god is sin and sabbath
[1:09:13] stop and see so now by the way this fact
[1:09:16] people
[1:09:16] some people they don't believe many
[1:09:18] christians don't believe this they don't
[1:09:19] even know
[1:09:20] others but in this world we have
[1:09:22] something to see that god is saying
[1:09:25] believe what you want to believe but
[1:09:27] that's the truth we have observancy
[1:09:32] okay now
[1:09:36] the towers are the serpent seed
[1:09:39] the good seed are the seed of god
[1:09:43] now these both partake of the same
[1:09:46] nourishment in the same house
[1:09:50] you will find those even those who
[1:09:51] cannot see any christianity
[1:09:54] they will be in the same
[1:09:57] church or the same christianity now you
[1:10:00] call that
[1:10:01] the earth okay the soil where they are
[1:10:04] planted
[1:10:06] it is the atheist the church so we are
[1:10:08] looking at the two findings
[1:10:11] they share the same sun one sun here
[1:10:14] s-u-n
[1:10:17] what is here
[1:10:41] do you like math so yeah you are now
[1:10:45] confused
[1:10:46] but actually you don't need to know math
[1:10:48] you already need to connect in the
[1:10:49] spirit
[1:10:51] so the s-u-n here means s-o-n
[1:10:55] the sun means the sun
[1:11:05] give it to me that beautiful one oh yes
[1:11:08] give it to me right here
[1:11:10] i want to demonstrate something for
[1:11:11] everyone here to see
[1:11:14] you see this beautiful flower
[1:11:17] as much as it is beautiful it will die
[1:11:22] if it has not
[1:11:33] so it will need water and
[1:11:37] the light so what does this
[1:11:52] hallelujah
[1:11:57] look you say like i've planted this
[1:12:00] beautiful flower here
[1:12:02] if this was a garden you will find also
[1:12:05] other weeds
[1:12:06] growing from in a year and enjoying the
[1:12:09] same
[1:12:10] light but in this case future we're
[1:12:12] talking about the right
[1:12:13] of the overworld
[1:12:18] oh he says
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:34] jesus
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:48] oh
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:02] jesus
[1:13:07] [Music]
[1:13:16] oh
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:30] jesus
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:45] civil rights that we need the son of
[1:13:47] jesus the son of god
[1:13:49] amen that we need is the same word
[1:13:52] that those tales will also meet
[1:13:58] they
[1:14:13] the submarine the second order this
[1:14:16] thing needs
[1:14:17] the same water that we don't need
[1:14:21] in that case rain
[1:14:24] is a symbolic to the straight
[1:14:28] spirit of carrying off
[1:14:31] the spirit you know
[1:14:35] just like a plant needs both
[1:14:38] water and sun we do
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:52] the spirit so now you when you receive
[1:14:55] the holy ghost
[1:14:56] you are the true child of god you will
[1:14:58] speak in
[1:15:00] times you will speak in but also out
[1:15:02] there
[1:15:03] they will also speak
[1:15:08] anyone so somebody is right and who is
[1:15:10] wrong
[1:15:11] they spoke entirely and you spoke in
[1:15:12] terms until some believers don't believe
[1:15:14] in speaking times anymore
[1:15:16] because the other spoken times it's just
[1:15:19] like uh i i i'm
[1:15:20] amazed saying ah me
[1:15:23] i'm not going to i'm not going to
[1:15:27] bear fruits anymore because these cocoa
[1:15:30] bears are also
[1:15:31] bearing fruits let them bear me uh
[1:15:36] can i
[1:16:13] [Applause]
[1:16:46] um
[1:17:00] [Music]
[1:17:14] but
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:28] my god help me so i can just for you
[1:17:31] something
[1:17:33] when you when you receive give them the
[1:17:35] word the body will come to them
[1:17:38] the holy spirit will come to them but
[1:17:41] they will bring
[1:17:41] salt of their kindness
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:29] the same spirit that matures you to be
[1:18:32] a perfect son of god is the same
[1:18:36] spirit which will take them even further
[1:18:38] away from god
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:18:53] is planted it has two things two major
[1:18:56] parts of it
[1:18:56] it has the the amaze
[1:19:00] how is it coming
[1:19:28] which looks like this is it how is it
[1:19:31] called
[1:19:33] the whole thing how is it called a
[1:19:36] flower
[1:19:38] no this is a flower
[1:19:46] it has got a shark i don't think the
[1:19:47] shark even had amazing projects
[1:20:03] we understand they will receive the same
[1:20:05] son that means you will receive the same
[1:20:07] sound so whether it
[1:20:08] may receive the same song
[1:20:16] you
[1:20:30] that as a matter of fact as long as it
[1:20:33] rejoices it will not be there with a
[1:20:35] shot
[1:20:35] it will not be there with the sea the
[1:20:38] seed can never be healed
[1:20:41] you understand yes when the the rain of
[1:20:45] the holy ghost comes down
[1:20:47] the serpent seed will rejoice after the
[1:20:50] same anointing that you as a seed of god
[1:20:52] will reduce under
[1:20:53] so don't ever be deceived by the
[1:20:55] rejoicing everyone will rejoice
[1:20:57] don't prophesy they will dream dreams
[1:20:59] they will have gifts and they will have
[1:21:01] signs and learners all of them among
[1:21:02] them actually
[1:21:03] don't fear because they have them but
[1:21:05] fear because you don't have them
[1:21:06] actually
[1:21:09] fear don't fear because they have they
[1:21:10] have those things don't fear because
[1:21:13] they have the manifestation but fear
[1:21:15] because you don't have the manifestation
[1:21:17] i mean what i'm saying yes when you say
[1:21:21] i don't know why i want to continue down
[1:21:22] i'm like stuck here because maybe
[1:21:24] someone needs to understand something
[1:21:25] look
[1:21:26] if you see on the other side for
[1:21:29] instance
[1:21:30] uh uh two plants and this
[1:21:33] you know they were all almost dying like
[1:21:35] that
[1:21:37] and then it rained and
[1:21:40] the other one slowly started to come out
[1:21:44] and the incident you just rejoice under
[1:21:46] that water
[1:21:47] and this beautiful sun and the other
[1:21:50] remains like that
[1:21:52] what do you say
[1:22:09] sister you are not because so what's
[1:22:12] happening
[1:22:17] it is dying right yes so the church
[1:22:20] without the manifestation of the spirit
[1:22:22] is dying is that they try to regardless
[1:22:24] of what
[1:22:24] what they call themselves even if they
[1:22:26] call themselves believers
[1:22:28] are you hearing me even if they call
[1:22:30] themselves
[1:22:31] but if there is no manifestation of the
[1:22:33] spirit that church is dead
[1:22:38] the manifestation of the holy spirit
[1:22:40] shows the life of the spirit
[1:22:42] and then that spirit of god if
[1:22:45] you are a seed of god it will bring
[1:22:48] forth
[1:22:48] out of you that life of god because you
[1:22:51] are a ceo
[1:22:53] but to them it will not bring for that
[1:22:54] life because they are not
[1:22:56] so they only bring forth who they are
[1:22:58] yes
[1:23:01] if you give water to uh
[1:23:04] to uh you know like you know they
[1:23:06] started the eagle sister
[1:23:07] basically that story last time
[1:23:10] you know that you know she was hatched
[1:23:14] under they eat
[1:23:16] their cheeks but it ended up a
[1:23:20] you know as much as you all look the
[1:23:22] same at the same food and everything but
[1:23:24] while they were eating from the time
[1:23:26] when they were very small
[1:23:28] as they grew as they grew each was
[1:23:30] showing their own characters
[1:23:32] yes so as you are here in this world you
[1:23:34] will end up doing your god
[1:23:36] so let us pray that you are all going to
[1:23:38] be the character of christ
[1:23:40] which is in you before the foundation of
[1:23:42] the world did you answer that point yes
[1:23:46] can you do it
[1:24:01] that it is in this last edge when the
[1:24:04] chairs
[1:24:04] are getting burned for their burning
[1:24:07] that they will solve out
[1:24:09] the wheat that is to be garnered
[1:24:13] by the lord
[1:24:18] i want to carry this salt all the way
[1:24:20] through
[1:24:21] so let us go a step further have you
[1:24:23] ever studied the history of revivals
[1:24:27] now the revivals now
[1:24:36] it never fails in the days of the great
[1:24:39] welsh revival
[1:24:56] and there was a great display of the
[1:24:59] devil
[1:25:00] power to take away the attention from
[1:25:03] god it's written that
[1:25:05] in wesley's day the people would not
[1:25:08] the people the most for peculiar things
[1:25:13] that would definitely also
[1:25:16] try to mock the goodness of the power
[1:25:18] quote
[1:25:19] in luther's days it said that the
[1:25:22] miracle of his means she did not claim
[1:25:24] the fact
[1:25:25] that he successfully produced the roman
[1:25:28] catholic church
[1:25:29] but the miracle play in the fact she
[1:25:32] could
[1:25:33] indeed stay sound and sing
[1:25:37] amidst the fanatics
[1:25:40] who are often filled with and guided by
[1:25:44] wrong spirits and if you
[1:25:47] have been aware of this last ministry
[1:25:50] you will have noted the same inversion
[1:25:52] of false and wicked spirits
[1:25:55] it has to be that way now i hope
[1:25:58] and trust you are spiritual minded
[1:26:01] enough to get
[1:26:02] that and capitalize on it
[1:26:06] just still responding the true and false
[1:26:09] veins mainly
[1:26:10] and demonstrating the two spirits that
[1:26:12] are at work
[1:26:13] let us look into first john chapter four
[1:26:17] one one to four and jude chapter three
[1:26:20] chapter
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:34] let's
[1:26:45] revivals in something that uh
[1:26:51] usually happens in every revival because
[1:26:54] this same thing is happening in our
[1:26:55] bible today go ahead
[1:27:08] we i think let me invite you to this
[1:27:12] reading from
[1:27:14] where it says that saturn is there okay
[1:27:17] it says
[1:27:20] and every time god moves starting with
[1:27:23] that
[1:27:29] it never fails
[1:27:34] so it really shows us
[1:27:38] that it's taking us about
[1:27:58] also
[1:28:12] oh i'm going to show you something
[1:28:16] there is always someone to oppose
[1:28:26] so
[1:28:28] and that person is in a form of a spirit
[1:28:32] and their security that tries
[1:28:35] and that person is with you only okay
[1:28:38] cannot be in you
[1:28:39] at times but and be that okay that comes
[1:28:43] for instance when there is a revival
[1:28:47] that is starting
[1:28:50] and those will come to persecution
[1:28:54] or discourage you that's what i can say
[1:28:58] is also moving if you break you down
[1:29:02] and bring your thoughts you can't manage
[1:29:06] it
[1:29:07] no one is listening to you okay yes
[1:29:10] you'll be
[1:29:16] that is what i can say as far as when
[1:29:18] god moves i suddenly lose
[1:29:22] and you always have to know that it will
[1:29:24] never fail
[1:29:26] yes even if when you okay
[1:29:29] for instance this message
[1:29:32] we've always met people who tell us
[1:29:37] the way they sing their cold blood day
[1:29:40] personally i've had people who are
[1:29:43] minorities who tell me that
[1:29:47] following a man so they may
[1:29:50] try if you're not very punctual if you
[1:29:52] don't know what to do
[1:29:54] you may you know fail it comes by
[1:29:57] yes a development will start
[1:30:01] in your mind changing you from where you
[1:30:06] are
[1:30:06] trying to take into account i mean
[1:30:13] something that i wrote it down again
[1:30:15] that i wanted to system
[1:30:26] yes
[1:30:30] something that i wanted to say
[1:30:37] okay it's giving me something here
[1:30:42] okay as you are continuing this is uh
[1:30:46] that way
[1:31:00] explaining i want to say
[1:31:06] it's if the spirit of the devil the
[1:31:09] spirit of god
[1:31:12] the spirit of the devil can either
[1:31:14] impersonate
[1:31:15] or try to mimic can
[1:31:18] either mimic or or oppose
[1:31:22] any opposite or basically today what the
[1:31:26] the true spirit is bring it can either
[1:31:29] oppose or join but to bring the shame at
[1:31:31] the end of the
[1:31:32] the end of the the end of the day
[1:31:36] example sometimes you may have a revival
[1:31:38] in the church
[1:31:39] whereby some people can speak the tanks
[1:31:41] and others in the parade or
[1:31:43] some others prophesy but you find that
[1:31:46] availability can be interpreting the
[1:31:49] tanks and visa
[1:31:50] is a gay or is a is a fornicator
[1:31:54] so the devil wants this when this
[1:31:56] fornication will be revealed
[1:31:58] now they will result of their holy
[1:31:59] spirit to be there of the devil
[1:32:04] are you getting me yes
[1:32:11] the devil will come either either
[1:32:14] to put a shame or to persecute he can
[1:32:17] persecute whatever
[1:32:18] the holy spirit is doing or try to to be
[1:32:21] under the influence of the same spirit
[1:32:23] but at the end of the day the wicked
[1:32:25] will be revealed
[1:32:26] then the devil will see their own banjo
[1:32:28] was of the devil
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:38] anyway
[1:32:47] you know by the way friends this is
[1:32:49] quite a very
[1:32:50] very important thing especially
[1:32:54] during our time where we're living
[1:32:57] i'm pleasing your attention all of you
[1:33:01] you see that uh god
[1:33:07] god works in his people
[1:33:10] in every generation we are only looking
[1:33:13] at the official church agent we will be
[1:33:14] able to see
[1:33:15] but i want you to understand that
[1:33:17] whenever there is
[1:33:18] a move of god the devil also moves
[1:33:23] and like father i was saying and brother
[1:33:25] o'carroll to
[1:33:26] try what is the purpose listen to this
[1:33:29] please what's the purpose
[1:33:32] to try and describe
[1:33:35] what god is doing to end up saying
[1:33:39] to to make it feel as if what god was
[1:33:43] doing
[1:33:43] was not really credible
[1:33:46] what god was doing was not really
[1:33:51] that big a big deal you understand the
[1:33:54] devil has
[1:33:55] always wanted to discredit
[1:33:58] the move of god always and he has given
[1:34:02] us an example here
[1:34:03] that in the day of vu
[1:34:08] he says in the day it is that in his day
[1:34:12] the people who do most peculiar things
[1:34:15] that were definitely of saturn
[1:34:17] you know in joining within this day this
[1:34:20] was the time
[1:34:21] when god was moving in power another
[1:34:24] time of revival
[1:34:26] and this was the time that missionaries
[1:34:29] were going all over
[1:34:30] people are loving one another that's
[1:34:31] preaching holiness and love
[1:34:33] are you following me yes yes and uh
[1:34:36] this were that was the time that uh also
[1:34:39] the same time that
[1:34:40] the devil tried to make the people do
[1:34:44] very very different or strange things
[1:34:47] that were observed what was the purpose
[1:34:50] to try and move
[1:34:52] the goodness and power of god
[1:34:55] and then he said also in ruler's day it
[1:34:58] is said that the miracle of the of the
[1:35:00] ministry of luther was not
[1:35:03] because he protested the roman catholic
[1:35:06] church
[1:35:06] but the miracle was that he was able to
[1:35:10] stay
[1:35:10] sane to stop sober
[1:35:17] you know in the right direction
[1:35:21] uh regardless of
[1:35:26] uh
[1:35:34] is a fanatic
[1:35:38] is someone who i would i prefer to
[1:35:40] present this way
[1:35:42] a fanatic is someone who believes
[1:35:45] something
[1:35:46] and goes overboard any other
[1:35:50] yes a fanatic is someone who over
[1:35:53] believes
[1:35:53] something and it's like you've often
[1:35:57] seen people
[1:35:58] who say that they are in the spirit
[1:36:03] i don't know if i should say this let me
[1:36:05] let me say this
[1:36:07] we have seen people and i will not give
[1:36:10] examples from outside the message but i
[1:36:14] i will have
[1:36:14] i will give uh an example within
[1:36:18] the confines of the believers of this
[1:36:21] message
[1:36:22] sometimes you find you form groups that
[1:36:25] tend
[1:36:26] to say they accept the holy spirit but
[1:36:29] they
[1:36:29] tend also to go overboard you know
[1:36:32] you've seen
[1:36:33] we've had moments whereby a preacher can
[1:36:35] preach
[1:36:36] and no one is even able to hear what the
[1:36:38] preacher is saying
[1:36:39] but okay you know what i'm talking about
[1:36:41] and uh
[1:36:42] why because everyone is shouting
[1:36:45] at the same time with the preacher also
[1:36:49] preaching preaching the word so then you
[1:36:52] often wonder
[1:36:53] which one what is right
[1:36:57] because imagine a pitcher is preaching a
[1:36:59] point like right now i'm preaching a
[1:37:00] point you're all
[1:37:01] listening right yes but now for them
[1:37:04] to claim that they're in the spirit i'm
[1:37:07] preaching and
[1:37:08] this one is also shouting on top of this
[1:37:09] place and also running up coming here
[1:37:11] to meet me at the other side almost
[1:37:13] everyone is going to put
[1:37:14] it all shouting almost even carrying me
[1:37:16] to the you know
[1:37:18] you know and it's like confusion in the
[1:37:20] church
[1:37:21] that's to me it's like fanaticism you
[1:37:24] know
[1:37:25] you know it's you know the preacher is
[1:37:28] preaching and you
[1:37:28] are you are rolling on the floor you
[1:37:31] know you're running
[1:37:42] you know this church you know they
[1:37:44] accept the manifestation of the spirit
[1:37:46] and all that but
[1:37:48] you say they give them enough time to
[1:37:51] pray and to you know
[1:37:52] when it comes time for him to teach now
[1:37:55] of course he has preaching sessions and
[1:37:56] when it is a teaching station he tells
[1:37:59] the people i want you sober
[1:38:00] okay i want you to be sober like all of
[1:38:02] you are sober right now
[1:38:04] sit down and here
[1:38:08] and now there's a sister who are still
[1:38:09] in this
[1:38:11] spirit okay shouting and praying
[1:38:19] you know and she was distracted
[1:38:21] everybody was from hearing what
[1:38:22] was going so the pastor stopped
[1:38:26] and he said sister he called her name
[1:38:30] said sister can you please go back to
[1:38:32] your seat
[1:38:33] and let me know also minister
[1:38:37] my that takes now huh it's like
[1:38:41] someone said oh you're
[1:38:57] broke the floor of the spirit but the
[1:38:58] pastor put the sister in order
[1:39:01] just like uh paul has told us if we are
[1:39:04] going to have
[1:39:05] times to be spoken in the church not
[1:39:08] everyone is going to
[1:39:10] speak at the same time you understand
[1:39:13] yes if everyone speaks times at the same
[1:39:16] time
[1:39:16] it will bring confusion and not
[1:39:18] edification to the church
[1:39:20] why the others are like fanatics
[1:39:24] why because they do not observe
[1:39:28] or even believe in the order of the
[1:39:31] operation of the gifts in the church
[1:39:33] but in the message you know to strike
[1:39:35] this balance to text the grace of god
[1:39:37] because many
[1:39:38] have thought that they are striving to
[1:39:39] strike the balance and they end up
[1:39:41] becoming also
[1:39:42] one you know it's aggressing people who
[1:39:45] are in the spirit
[1:39:46] and you know breaking anointing and you
[1:39:49] know
[1:39:50] by saying that we believe in order does
[1:39:54] not also mean
[1:39:55] we don't believe in the flow and
[1:39:58] manifestation
[1:39:59] of the spirit yes you understand what
[1:40:02] i'm saying
[1:40:03] you know we believe in praying in times
[1:40:06] we believe in prophesying we believe in
[1:40:08] the same vision to believe in shouting
[1:40:09] in the church
[1:40:12] oh you guys you just raised up your
[1:40:15] hands but you didn't even shout at all
[1:40:17] and you said you believe it
[1:40:18] do you believe in shouting in chat
[1:40:32] i feel like as if i'm not in the right
[1:40:33] place maybe i'm in a
[1:40:35] you say much of the way your friends
[1:40:37] very quiet things even
[1:40:39] even if you you are allowing the person
[1:40:41] when you mean
[1:40:42] brother you know you will be quiet not
[1:40:45] enough that you are paid but that you
[1:40:46] are
[1:40:47] you know among the dead
[1:41:11] so in other words what i'm saying is our
[1:41:13] churches should not be
[1:41:14] more chinese because we believe the
[1:41:16] message
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:30] god
[1:41:42] that level of balance sometimes it takes
[1:41:45] the grace of god right it takes the
[1:41:47] grace of god but what
[1:41:48] i'm going to be trying to explain here
[1:41:50] is that in the days of jerusalem for
[1:41:52] example around the days of
[1:41:53] uh uh for example what he had to fight
[1:41:57] and to read through was fanaticism what
[1:42:00] is fanaticism
[1:42:01] these are people on tour that would go
[1:42:03] and begin breaking the
[1:42:05] uh because they were producing the
[1:42:07] catholic church right so they would go
[1:42:08] and
[1:42:09] get the idols before they tried to
[1:42:12] go there
[1:42:40] wrong adultery we are not against the
[1:42:43] people that preached our doctrine
[1:42:44] you get a problem so i'm not going to
[1:42:46] talk about the beginning
[1:42:48] you know what i'm saying i'm saying
[1:42:49] you're not an evangelistic message so i
[1:42:51] begin crushing them and putting their
[1:42:54] names
[1:43:16] i'm behaving like a fanatic right
[1:43:18] because i think it's like
[1:43:20] i am holier than that it's a
[1:43:22] holier-than-thou
[1:43:23] you know so sometimes you find it i
[1:43:26] often also see that
[1:43:27] when i believe by the way i believe in
[1:43:30] you know in getting drunk
[1:43:31] in the spirit you can even sometimes
[1:43:33] roll on the floor and shout and
[1:43:34] you know whatever the whole spirit comes
[1:43:36] in you can't control those states you
[1:43:38] know it's like
[1:43:39] you are in the spirit
[1:43:42] but i also believe that the spirit of
[1:43:44] god is ordered
[1:43:45] okay you're not going to break all the
[1:43:47] chairs in the chat because you were in
[1:43:48] this field
[1:43:49] okay so really some people become
[1:43:52] fanatics you know
[1:43:54] you grab the chair
[1:43:58] and it was because you were in your
[1:44:00] spirit
[1:44:03] really then a lot of time
[1:44:19] you you said that in lures they said
[1:44:21] that the miracle of his ministry
[1:44:23] did not lie in the fact that he
[1:44:25] successfully protested
[1:44:27] but that the mirror connected the fact
[1:44:29] that he could and he did
[1:44:30] stay around and send i mean it's the
[1:44:34] fanatics it's
[1:44:35] it needs to say sound sorry it is the
[1:44:38] sound
[1:44:40] and send sen means what
[1:44:43] you know in the right mental attitude in
[1:44:48] the right mental
[1:44:49] uh understanding a medius in the middle
[1:44:52] of the fanatics
[1:44:53] who were often filled with and guided by
[1:44:57] wrong
[1:44:57] spirits so somehow so in our generation
[1:45:00] today
[1:45:01] the unit is the same thing now
[1:45:05] please this is very sensitive and you
[1:45:06] must hear me and understand me very well
[1:45:09] what we see among the pentecostalism
[1:45:11] today
[1:45:13] the so-called metaphors dependent
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:28] when you ask this person why did you you
[1:45:30] know sometimes they even it's the
[1:45:32] preacher was pushing
[1:45:32] on them and then before that and then
[1:45:34] they kind of said it was the spirit
[1:45:36] you know what are these things they hear
[1:45:39] these things
[1:45:40] are here because they have to discourage
[1:45:42] what god
[1:45:43] is doing among the members of the bride
[1:45:46] yes
[1:45:47] the holy spirit is moving and wanting to
[1:45:50] move in great power
[1:45:52] in the members of the bride with the
[1:45:54] members of the true church of the true
[1:45:57] we are fighting to sleep down here but
[1:45:59] that true vine
[1:46:00] that the first fight is trying to come
[1:46:03] in and describe it the true vibe so that
[1:46:06] when the people see it they will say ah
[1:46:09] i won't be afraid
[1:46:14] [Music]
[1:46:25] so that now people will fear they will
[1:46:27] say i will not associate myself with us
[1:46:29] they never thought that that would
[1:46:31] hinder the true move of god
[1:46:33] but you can never hear the true move of
[1:46:34] god because the true vine
[1:46:36] in every direction will always be
[1:46:39] steered
[1:46:40] and focused on purpose and
[1:46:43] they will be aligned to the right the
[1:46:46] right way
[1:46:47] the right way but what will somehow hold
[1:46:49] them
[1:46:50] and put them in the right path to be
[1:46:53] able to overcome
[1:46:54] the uh all the fanaticism and all the
[1:46:59] uh
[1:47:02] of the generation so you see all the
[1:47:04] false prophets in our generation
[1:47:06] the false prophets the false christ the
[1:47:08] falsehood man of god here man of god
[1:47:10] money man of god everywhere almost every
[1:47:13] road on every
[1:47:13] street that is meant to do what
[1:47:17] to know what god is doing so right now i
[1:47:20] will say i
[1:47:21] saw you you you know i was there you
[1:47:23] know
[1:47:24] that telling them how about a banana was
[1:47:25] designing because one was one of the
[1:47:28] medications
[1:47:29] they are like even in here
[1:47:38] whenever someone ever comes to you and
[1:47:40] says that they are prophet or their
[1:47:42] pastor their
[1:47:42] man of god can design i want you to
[1:47:44] remind them two things
[1:47:46] i'm going to give this equipment to you
[1:47:48] now number one
[1:47:51] no man since the days of jesus christ
[1:47:53] has had a discernment ministry
[1:47:56] like that of badavana it only
[1:47:59] seems to be in the name of jesus christ
[1:48:01] until the prophet
[1:48:03] of malachi for the virgin tense that's
[1:48:05] when it happened
[1:48:07] i'm not talking about the designate of
[1:48:09] the spirits i'm talking about resentment
[1:48:10] of the heart
[1:48:11] to where to the extent that that woman
[1:48:14] had to run until the
[1:48:16] people come and see a man who was
[1:48:17] talking to me the things i did in my
[1:48:19] heart is that this is the messiah
[1:48:20] so what jesus did show the heart that
[1:48:23] this was the ministry of
[1:48:25] the promised messiah the minister of
[1:48:27] alabama was in fulfillment of group 17
[1:48:30] and
[1:48:32] [Music]
[1:48:34] the ministry of the messiah again in our
[1:48:37] generation
[1:48:38] jesus christ manifested himself in flesh
[1:48:42] in a ministry of a prophet on earth
[1:48:47] one thing tell them that it does never
[1:48:49] happen again what does that
[1:48:51] what i mean it has never happened before
[1:48:53] what does that mean
[1:48:55] of course before you get affected what
[1:48:57] do you have
[1:49:18] [Music]
[1:49:26] come
[1:49:41] number one number two their ministries
[1:49:45] when they say that they have designment
[1:49:47] of their ad it's not
[1:49:49] true why because all of us who are
[1:49:52] afraid to have it
[1:49:53] it fails at one point and they tell
[1:49:56] things
[1:49:56] which are right right right right and
[1:49:59] then finally they tell one which is
[1:50:00] wrong
[1:50:01] another which is wrong but all through
[1:50:03] the midst of
[1:50:04] that gift it has never told anything
[1:50:07] that it was wrong it is all recorded on
[1:50:09] death
[1:50:10] not not one like this i said not one
[1:50:12] like this
[1:50:13] that was ever wrong or discredited at
[1:50:17] any time
[1:50:17] what does it show you that was the
[1:50:21] real deal okay so but anyways people
[1:50:25] today have
[1:50:26] you know many i have powering the
[1:50:28] anointing and
[1:50:29] things like that so now it is meant to
[1:50:31] move and to try and
[1:50:33] blind the people's eyes from the reality
[1:50:36] but they should have got their eyes a
[1:50:37] little bit divine
[1:50:39] from the reality
[1:50:42] are you following me okay
[1:50:46] can you read one
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:51:13] [Music]
[1:51:19] they are of god because many
[1:51:22] universe prophets are going out into the
[1:51:25] world
[1:51:27] hereby know ye
[1:51:30] the first prophet
[1:51:46] is
[1:51:55] [Music]
[1:52:01] eat with the world of god
[1:52:04] little children and have overcome them
[1:52:10] because greater is he that is in you
[1:52:14] than he that is in the world
[1:52:17] judy foreign
[1:52:22] when i give all delegates to write unto
[1:52:25] you of the common salvation
[1:52:27] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:52:32] episode to you that you should honestly
[1:52:36] condemn for the faith
[1:52:37] which was once delivered unto the saints
[1:52:40] but there are certain men
[1:52:44] tripped in unawares
[1:52:47] these have come into into the
[1:52:51] fall by means of the dog and
[1:52:54] there are four robbers who
[1:52:58] where before or fall ordained to this
[1:53:01] condemnation
[1:53:02] ungodly men turning the rest of our word
[1:53:05] into
[1:53:06] last graciousness and denying that only
[1:53:10] lord god
[1:53:12] our lord jesus christ these
[1:53:15] are spots in your fists of charity
[1:53:19] when they face with you feeding
[1:53:22] themselves without fear
[1:53:24] cannot be denied the first of these
[1:53:26] scriptures that the true church and the
[1:53:28] first church
[1:53:30] are in that queen
[1:53:33] having been planted together but of
[1:53:36] different things
[1:53:38] they
[1:53:42] and until today the true church
[1:53:45] and the false church are intertwined
[1:53:47] they are together you cannot almost
[1:53:49] separate them okay let us continue
[1:53:53] now then i think there is something else
[1:53:56] you
[1:53:56] ought to know the seven churches
[1:54:00] which are addressed by young are in asia
[1:54:03] minor
[1:54:04] and are all gender churches
[1:54:08] he does not speak to the church at
[1:54:10] jerusalem which was mostly jewish
[1:54:12] with perhaps just a few gentiles in it
[1:54:16] the reason is that god had turned from
[1:54:19] the jews to the gentiles thus
[1:54:22] the world of the child's ages is god
[1:54:24] dealing with the gentiles
[1:54:26] and calling out a gentile bride to
[1:54:29] himself
[1:54:30] that makes the church edges and the
[1:54:32] fullness of the gentiles
[1:54:35] the one and the same thing acts
[1:54:38] chapter 13 verse 44 48
[1:54:43] and and the next sabbath they came
[1:54:45] almost
[1:54:46] the whole city together to hear
[1:54:50] the word of god but when they used
[1:54:52] solemn attitudes
[1:54:54] they were filled with enemies and
[1:54:56] sparked against those things which were
[1:54:58] spoken before
[1:54:59] contradicting and just blessed family
[1:55:07] it was necessary that the word of god
[1:55:09] should first have been spoken to you
[1:55:12] but seeing you put it from you
[1:55:15] and judge yourselves unworthy of
[1:55:17] everlasting life
[1:55:19] no down to million times for so hard
[1:55:23] the lord commanded us saying i have set
[1:55:26] thee
[1:55:27] to be a light of the youngest that thou
[1:55:30] should best be for salvation unto the
[1:55:33] earth
[1:55:34] of the earth and when the gentiles had
[1:55:36] this
[1:55:37] they were glad and glorified the word of
[1:55:40] the lord
[1:55:41] and as many as were then life believed
[1:55:58] from the gender dispensation now you
[1:56:00] will know where i'm coming from
[1:56:02] in the videos series of the data
[1:56:04] dispensation now
[1:56:06] so uh but i wanna let's just look at
[1:56:08] that last paragraph there now when i
[1:56:09] think that something else you want to
[1:56:11] know
[1:56:11] the seven churches which are addressed
[1:56:13] by jonah in asia minor and are all
[1:56:15] gendered chances all of them
[1:56:17] yes the general churches it doesn't
[1:56:19] speak to the church of jerusalem which
[1:56:21] was mostly jewish
[1:56:22] with perhaps just a few genders in it
[1:56:25] the reason is that god had turned from
[1:56:26] the jews to the gentiles that's
[1:56:28] the one of the church ages is god
[1:56:30] dealing with there
[1:56:33] and calling out agenda to himself now
[1:56:35] you remember
[1:56:36] he does also deal with the jews but the
[1:56:39] jews have their time running
[1:56:40] when he deals
[1:56:54] the difference between you and gentiles
[1:56:56] let me ask three people
[1:56:58] two uh two sisters two brothers brothers
[1:57:02] let us begin with you
[1:57:03] what's the difference between gentiles
[1:57:22] is
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:32] okay perfectly safe yes
[1:57:36] the next one
[1:57:44] sisters do you agree with what these
[1:57:46] young men are saying
[1:57:48] what do you know about this
[1:57:52] [Music]
[1:58:03] okay so what the land use
[1:58:10] well not in israel so it is right now
[1:58:13] as a country that is not non-jews
[1:58:33] not a person from israeli so what's that
[1:58:46] now
[1:59:15] and so god does not deal with that at
[1:59:16] the same time and their timing
[1:59:18] is in the seven in 70 weeks and the
[1:59:21] hours
[1:59:21] is fitted in now by grace within the
[1:59:24] period
[1:59:25] of the jews there has been four hours to
[1:59:28] be put on so
[1:59:29] theirs is cut off they are cut off for
[1:59:31] us to be grafted in
[1:59:33] so we can now see that we are in this
[1:59:35] digress
[1:59:36] hallelujah tell your brothers you are
[1:59:39] into this by grace
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:25] the seven stars in his right hand who
[2:00:28] walkers
[2:00:30] in the midst of the seven golden thunder
[2:00:33] stages
[2:00:34] i know they looks i know
[2:00:37] they work and they live
[2:00:41] and their patience and how
[2:00:45] the cannot bear
[2:00:49] them which are equal so if some of you
[2:00:52] are you are finding difficult in reading
[2:00:54] that you can even read like this
[2:00:55] i know your works your labor your
[2:00:58] patience
[2:00:59] i also know how you cannot bear them
[2:01:01] which i give you right
[2:01:03] okay continue
[2:01:06] and now let's spread
[2:01:09] them which say they are
[2:01:12] apostle and a note and
[2:01:16] as found them less
[2:01:19] and as born and as
[2:01:22] an as patients and for
[2:01:25] their name sake has labored
[2:01:29] and has not fainted
[2:01:33] nevertheless i have i have
[2:01:36] somewhat again against thee
[2:01:40] because thou has left their first
[2:01:43] love remember therefore
[2:01:47] from from whence thou had
[2:01:50] fallen and repent and do
[2:01:53] and do the first words or else
[2:01:57] i will i will come unto thee
[2:02:01] quickly and will remove that kind of
[2:02:04] stick
[2:02:05] out of his place except
[2:02:09] though repaint but this door has
[2:02:13] that though it is
[2:02:16] the deeds
[2:02:27] all of us together
[2:02:44] now that is the message point number one
[2:02:48] that's the message that you phrase and
[2:02:50] church age it
[2:02:52] to the message of the presidential age
[2:02:54] this
[2:02:55] is all embedded in regulation chapter 2
[2:02:59] verses one two to seven
[2:03:03] now straight away we're going to go into
[2:03:06] the next sub-topic there to learn about
[2:03:09] the messenger
[2:03:11] of discharge age okay
[2:03:14] uh i know you already read this so can
[2:03:16] someone please explain that first
[2:03:18] paragraph without having to read it
[2:03:22] yes touch your hands with brother
[2:03:24] polycarp you want to do that
[2:03:26] please
[2:03:29] famous and messenger
[2:03:35] saying that the refugee church h
[2:03:38] was paul and
[2:03:42] paul was actually at first which is the
[2:03:44] jews
[2:03:46] but then we just recognized the previous
[2:03:50] uh paragraph sets he told the dude that
[2:03:54] god has told us now to talk to the
[2:03:56] gentiles
[2:03:57] and the first gentile church
[2:04:02] was the church at emphasis
[2:04:06] if you don't take it
[2:04:10] uh and now he was
[2:04:14] pretty good about stretch
[2:04:20] so i think just for that
[2:04:24] can you say it is poor what authority do
[2:04:27] you have to say this boy
[2:04:30] why not peter
[2:04:33] what the what imagine you are meeting a
[2:04:36] friend and you say
[2:04:50] and your friends
[2:05:00] okay show it to us
[2:05:18] if
[2:06:00] huh okay
[2:06:04] but it's in uh page 71
[2:06:10] second program and sister john will be
[2:06:12] very very
[2:06:13] attentive because i'm coming back
[2:06:24] [Music]
[2:06:25] they came almost the whole city
[2:06:28] of together but when the jews saw them
[2:06:31] all jesus they were filled with envy
[2:06:33] and what did they wear
[2:06:36] actually
[2:06:40] okay but when they just saw their mouth
[2:06:43] suits
[2:06:44] they were filled with envy and spread
[2:06:46] against those things
[2:06:48] which were spoken by paul contradicting
[2:06:51] and blaspheming
[2:06:53] then paul and barnabas was bold
[2:06:57] said it doesn't necessarily the god of
[2:06:59] god
[2:07:00] should first should first have been
[2:07:03] spoken
[2:07:04] to you but seeing it put it from you
[2:07:08] and that your soul is another life no we
[2:07:11] turn to the gentiles
[2:07:12] who would have commanded us
[2:07:15] let me stop there but uh what i can
[2:07:18] actually tell someone that
[2:07:20] paul finished that part definition yeah
[2:07:24] that fast would you have
[2:07:39] that the yes should be for salvation
[2:07:42] until the end of the earth and when the
[2:07:44] gentiles had these girls lord
[2:07:46] and glorified the word of the lord and
[2:07:49] as many
[2:07:50] were ordained eternal life believed
[2:07:54] yeah i finished reading okay but
[2:07:57] actually it's okay yeah explain to us
[2:08:00] paul had the authority to say this
[2:08:04] and also the other thing which i which i
[2:08:07] like from it is that
[2:08:10] uh the jews said
[2:08:13] what paul was talking was contradicting
[2:08:16] and blaspheming
[2:08:18] and most of the things which the jews
[2:08:21] were doing
[2:08:22] would actually change their living
[2:08:26] because now the things like eating they
[2:08:29] had their own culture and stuff
[2:08:31] so it changed most of them and starts
[2:08:34] falling
[2:08:40] and by now you will think that your sdf
[2:08:43] plane is convinced
[2:08:50] then then maybe if it tells me to speed
[2:08:52] up
[2:08:53] and i remember one time we talked about
[2:08:56] when
[2:08:57] peter and paul actually were arguing
[2:08:59] about some things
[2:09:00] then would show peter at what
[2:09:17] write it down after you finish go check
[2:09:19] it out is it in the
[2:09:20] bible with the message once your eyes is
[2:09:23] there oh
[2:09:24] you will now use it also once your house
[2:09:26] is not there come back to me but faster
[2:09:28] you say
[2:09:28] this what is it what is it in
[2:09:44] before you really run around with
[2:09:46] something you have to ensure that it is
[2:09:48] in the world
[2:09:49] can someone read from romans 11 13
[2:09:51] because that one is direct to the point
[2:10:32] so we can now authoritatively say paul
[2:10:35] was the apostle to the gender that's
[2:10:38] what i'm about
[2:10:54] yes
[2:11:08] he saw no money but he
[2:11:11] did but they led him by their hand
[2:11:14] and brought him into the massacres and
[2:11:17] he was eight days without sight
[2:11:19] and neither did no break
[2:11:35] and the lord said unto him arise and go
[2:11:39] into the street which is called strange
[2:11:42] and inquire
[2:11:43] in the house of judas for one gold star
[2:11:47] of justice for behold he prayed
[2:11:52] and he and have seen a vision a man
[2:11:56] named
[2:11:57] coming in and looking at his hand from
[2:12:00] him
[2:12:01] that he might receive his sight then
[2:12:03] anonymous answer
[2:12:05] lord i have heard by many of this man
[2:12:09] how much people have
[2:12:12] done
[2:12:16] here we have authority from the chief
[2:12:20] priests combined all that fall from thy
[2:12:22] name
[2:12:23] but the lord said that i wait
[2:12:26] for he is the chosen verse of one to me
[2:12:30] to bear my name before the gentiles
[2:12:36] [Music]
[2:12:47] ah no one can doubt it no one can do it
[2:12:52] okay uh someone can you wait for me
[2:12:57] that a paragraph there
[2:13:01] after romans 11 paul founded the church
[2:13:05] at ephesus
[2:13:27] all right
[2:13:38] this enables us to set the date for the
[2:13:42] beginning
[2:13:49] [Music]
[2:13:56] foreign
[2:14:12] [Music]
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:38] do you read anyway in the bible
[2:14:41] it's unfortunate do you have a bible
[2:14:44] church
[2:14:45] it's a place do you have a right
[2:14:48] where do you see that in the bible
[2:15:06] friends
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:20] all
[2:15:32] come on
[2:15:38] someone someone
[2:15:41] no one
[2:15:52] oh
[2:15:55] no one can try even
[2:16:00] okay someone can try
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:16] give it to me here
[2:16:23] chapter 19.
[2:16:30] ah obama said me equations one one
[2:16:34] what does efficiency one one say
[2:16:41] sorry your brother
[2:16:58] um are
[2:17:00] professors and to their faith
[2:17:03] jesus hallelujah that one is
[2:17:06] good he writes to the ephesians but
[2:17:10] not necessarily saying that he started
[2:17:14] go ahead and give me that class
[2:17:18] you're pleased okay can you read
[2:17:48] [Music]
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:11] yes but not in the new testament
[2:18:15] well i believe as following after the
[2:18:17] faith of
[2:18:18] repentance only john's ministry okay
[2:18:21] continuity brother that's
[2:18:23] he said unto them have been received was
[2:18:26] sincere believed
[2:18:28] and they said unto him we have not so
[2:18:30] much
[2:18:31] as hearts whether there be any holy
[2:18:33] ghost
[2:18:35] and he said unto them and to what then
[2:18:37] were he baptized
[2:18:39] and they said unto john's baptism
[2:18:42] then saint paul john really baptized you
[2:18:45] the baptism of repentance
[2:18:47] saying unto the people that they should
[2:18:49] believe on him
[2:18:51] which should come after him that
[2:18:54] is on christ jesus when they had this
[2:18:57] they were baptized in the name
[2:18:59] of the lord jesus
[2:19:03] and so is the beginning of the ephesians
[2:19:05] church
[2:19:07] these things were right
[2:19:10] they were in ephesians yes paul found
[2:19:13] them
[2:19:14] fought with them further praised them
[2:19:18] paul prayed for them
[2:19:32] right
[2:19:47] the people are not necessarily
[2:19:50] only 12 about
[2:19:53] not necessarily only about 12 but the
[2:19:56] bible says
[2:19:57] maybe it means the main you know we do
[2:20:00] not know maybe they never measured the
[2:20:01] sisters and
[2:20:02] and the other you know so perhaps they
[2:20:04] were more than 12.
[2:20:06] yes but we know that the first chapter
[2:20:09] that uh were about
[2:20:10] twice the first started was at the
[2:20:11] ephesus and these were started by poor
[2:20:14] so
[2:20:20] about the middle of the first century
[2:20:23] have you seen where it starts
[2:20:25] yes okay
[2:20:28] now he said what those means we have a
[2:20:30] three-four equality three qualities
[2:20:33] now the way we have overstayed on
[2:20:36] this efficient chart age is because we
[2:20:40] are also making a foundation for all the
[2:20:42] others
[2:20:53] so the first we set a sequence
[2:20:56] for us even for the next strategies and
[2:20:59] the messengers and everything
[2:21:02] so paul was absolutely true to the world
[2:21:04] that's the first point
[2:21:06] he never deviated from it no matter what
[2:21:10] the cost paul
[2:21:12] never left the world never developed
[2:21:15] from the world
[2:21:16] paul never compromised the word sir was
[2:21:19] exactly true
[2:21:20] to the world you can see those next
[2:21:23] scriptures i'm sure you read them
[2:21:24] where it says if any man preach another
[2:21:26] gospel and what you have preached
[2:21:27] even if it is let them be cast
[2:21:32] even if it's an angel from heaven this
[2:21:34] word of god
[2:22:04] [Music]
[2:22:20] because
[2:22:29] it's like man can change his word at any
[2:22:31] time i'm sorry we mean that
[2:22:33] you see but god cannot change his words
[2:22:37] yes because god cannot repent what he
[2:22:39] says first
[2:22:40] is perfect even before he says it
[2:22:42] hallelujah
[2:22:44] so the word of god can never be changed
[2:22:45] whatever was told by the apostles
[2:22:47] including paul can never
[2:23:23] [Applause]
[2:23:36] [Music]
[2:23:41] [Applause]
[2:24:11] each of you should be a member in a
[2:24:13] certain church a place where you go
[2:24:15] and you play your wrath you are right
[2:24:19] some of you don't even know what it is
[2:24:21] we shall teach you about that
[2:24:22] and some of you are babies in christ i'm
[2:24:24] sure so we have to teach on that
[2:24:26] so when you
[2:24:41] you have your families you have your
[2:24:42] rights where you belong where you come
[2:24:45] from
[2:24:45] all right even the church of christ
[2:24:48] should be that with the believers
[2:24:50] you shouldn't just be here where you are
[2:24:53] whatever happens
[2:25:08] i have decided that this is my own
[2:25:10] church what you know that is a joke
[2:25:12] of course you can visit anywhere else
[2:25:13] but you know i belong here yes
[2:25:15] my life i paid here uh when i need
[2:25:18] prayer or whatever this one is my pastor
[2:25:20] i i look after him i look at him for
[2:25:23] leadership guidance
[2:25:24] according to the holy spirit right okay
[2:25:26] having said that now let me put that out
[2:25:29] here is what i wanted to say
[2:25:32] the true believers are not controlled by
[2:25:36] man
[2:25:38] the true believers are not controlled by
[2:25:41] a council of men or by a church or
[2:25:45] committee
[2:25:46] or by the degrees or by their pastor for
[2:25:47] that matter yes
[2:25:49] a true church the true church of jesus
[2:25:52] christ is controlled only by god and by
[2:25:55] the holy spirit
[2:25:57] the word comes heavy with you and sends
[2:26:00] you to god
[2:26:00] somewhere you're not going to go and
[2:26:03] they begin building your brother faster
[2:26:05] faster you know we would say okay please
[2:26:08] faster can i
[2:26:09] go please please let me go pastor please
[2:26:12] bless me
[2:26:13] and the man of god says yes pastor
[2:26:16] i am not ready that you should go to
[2:26:18] that place
[2:26:32] oh
[2:26:35] [Music]
[2:26:46] [Music]
[2:26:46] [Applause]
[2:27:00] but i'm teaching you that you must
[2:27:02] always be spiritual
[2:27:04] even if i sent you to go preach in some
[2:27:06] area where the holy spirit never sent
[2:27:08] you nothing will happen
[2:27:10] you must go somewhere where the holy
[2:27:12] spirit has sent you
[2:27:14] where the world
[2:27:25] [Music]
[2:27:35] [Applause]
[2:27:36] [Music]
[2:27:42] begin going out to giving up trucks and
[2:27:45] telling people comparing them to come to
[2:27:46] christ right
[2:27:47] you must be raised by the world speaking
[2:27:49] whatever you do
[2:27:56] foreign
[2:28:19] oh they make it very hard for people so
[2:28:21] when faster god is leading me to go
[2:28:23] someplace then they will begin casting
[2:28:25] them
[2:28:27] let all the casters be on you even
[2:28:31] you will not see any blessing because
[2:28:32] your blessing is remaining here
[2:28:35] i am the one who would be this for you
[2:28:36] and one who prayed so
[2:28:38] if you go to another place you are going
[2:28:40] with all the casters you don't have my
[2:28:41] blessings
[2:28:42] oh yeah if god is within you will press
[2:28:44] for you bye
[2:28:46] that kind of man is not ready by god
[2:28:48] when he does that
[2:28:50] and no person should ever do that
[2:28:52] therefore
[2:28:53] if any of you ever feel that
[2:28:56] if you make this your own church and you
[2:28:58] ever feel like i want to move on to
[2:28:59] another place
[2:29:00] god be with you deal with again
[2:29:06] because i believe that each of us is not
[2:29:08] confirmed by god
[2:29:10] we are controlled by it i had the holy
[2:29:13] spirit of course you you must have the
[2:29:14] holy spirit
[2:29:15] to control you yes some people don't
[2:29:17] have it and they said they always speak
[2:29:18] to
[2:29:18] me where they find you when you can have
[2:29:34] i know
[2:29:36] [Music]
[2:29:44] [Music]
[2:30:16] they don't you don't find the soldiers
[2:30:18] but it's what the child believes
[2:30:20] he said i'm sorry i would not do it
[2:30:22] that's how i'm left the baptist church
[2:30:24] and when he left the baptist church he
[2:30:26] went straight away and followed the
[2:30:27] leadership of the world spirit
[2:30:29] went in this place in jeffersonville
[2:30:30] brought a piece of land and started the
[2:30:32] tabernacle
[2:30:33] that church there and from there came a
[2:30:35] message over the world
[2:30:37] so don't begin to tell me that one
[2:30:39] cannot be the main and by the time he
[2:30:41] was doing all that i'm sure his child
[2:30:42] was feeling like
[2:30:43] he is now having all the classes on him
[2:30:45] this young man is just
[2:30:48] you know communicated you know
[2:30:55] he's looking for perspective he wants to
[2:30:57] you know get rich or something like that
[2:30:59] or he wants to make a name for himself
[2:31:00] for him no
[2:31:02] no matter what people think about you if
[2:31:04] you know it is god speaking to you
[2:31:06] if you're not is the word of the holy
[2:31:09] spirit
[2:31:10] because when you told me the word never
[2:31:12] lies
[2:31:26] everywhere
[2:31:50] never forget that whenever god moves
[2:31:54] suddenly moves also but god is always
[2:31:56] there in your heart
[2:31:58] to make you listen to his spirit don't
[2:32:00] say because i'm being i'm being
[2:32:02] sourced from every eternity i'm out of
[2:32:05] the world of god
[2:32:06] no as a matter of fact it's a clear sign
[2:32:09] of
[2:32:09] god it's with you hallelujah
[2:32:13] oh my gosh preaching that
[2:32:17] secondly three things i think we come to
[2:32:19] conclude with citizens
[2:32:22] we're not going now into the message
[2:32:24] separately his ministry was in the power
[2:32:26] of
[2:32:27] the spirit but by demonstrating the
[2:32:30] spoken hand
[2:32:33] so he wasn't just coming with uh
[2:32:59] [Music]
[2:33:46] oh man
[2:33:54] forgive me i'm just getting excited with
[2:33:56] this now
[2:33:57] what's the third thing sadly
[2:34:13] the three things to know that god sent
[2:34:15] you
[2:34:17] the three things to know at once
[2:34:28] yes
[2:34:56] number two will of course not be
[2:34:59] controlled by men will be controlled by
[2:35:00] god right
[2:35:01] number two your ministry will be in the
[2:35:04] power of
[2:35:05] that spirit demonstrating not be written
[2:35:09] and
[2:35:24] yes
[2:36:00] [Music]
[2:36:15] [Music]
[2:36:16] i came here only with my family but now
[2:36:19] even in that small church
[2:36:21] i'm sure when you come with the girls
[2:36:23] but okay we will not fit there anymore i
[2:36:25] don't think we shall fit
[2:36:26] i don't think we can fit it anymore but
[2:36:28] i was at first with only
[2:36:30] my family but now how many it's not even
[2:36:33] a more than a year right and it's been
[2:36:36] also a year of lockdowns
[2:36:38] but already sources are believing the
[2:36:40] message right
[2:36:41] and even those who have been a rupa and
[2:36:43] god is lifting them
[2:36:44] up right what does it show you it shows
[2:36:46] you what indeed is going to say that
[2:36:48] yeah that's the evidence of the ministry
[2:36:50] yes
[2:36:51] and that should be in each and every one
[2:36:53] of our lives
[2:36:55] hallelujah you people
[2:36:58] this one is very good i i should even
[2:37:01] have something to talk about more of it
[2:37:04] in the church amen
[2:37:08] oh that one got me anointed all right
[2:37:10] now
[2:37:11] i think i want to bring you to our close
[2:37:14] uh allow me because really if we just
[2:37:17] rush through this thing we are not going
[2:37:18] to get it very well because
[2:37:20] all of us now we will discuss on the
[2:37:22] city of ephesus
[2:37:24] then now we go to the message
[2:37:27] of that church let me say that let's go
[2:37:30] through it quickly but
[2:37:31] i know that you have heard these things
[2:37:32] i've integrated with these things
[2:37:35] so starting with a question on these
[2:37:37] messages
[2:37:38] of the message
[2:37:46] okay let us also deal with a let us also
[2:37:50] deal with the city of ephesus
[2:37:53] i think i'll explain this one part and
[2:37:58] then
[2:38:00] someone would read that really quickly
[2:38:01] through it please
[2:38:07] the city of ephesus is one of the three
[2:38:09] greatest cities in asia
[2:38:11] it was often called that city
[2:38:14] [Music]
[2:38:17] it was a very city the government was
[2:38:20] wrong
[2:38:20] but the language was greek historians
[2:38:22] believed that
[2:38:24] mary peter andrew and phillip for all
[2:38:26] buried in this beautiful city
[2:38:29] paulo founded the true faith in this
[2:38:31] city pastored here
[2:38:33] only about three hours but when he was
[2:38:35] absent from the flow
[2:38:37] he was continually prayerfully mindful
[2:38:41] of them
[2:38:41] timothy was the first bishop first
[2:38:43] timothy 1
[2:38:45] 1-3 for an apostle of christ
[2:38:48] of jesus christ by the commandment of
[2:38:50] god our savior
[2:38:51] and the lord and lord jesus christ which
[2:38:54] is our hope and ultimately my own
[2:38:56] son in the faith grace mercy and peace
[2:38:59] from god our father and jesus christ our
[2:39:01] lord
[2:39:02] as i either as i be sought to be to
[2:39:05] abide still at
[2:39:06] ephesus when i went into macedonia
[2:39:10] that thou might have charged some
[2:39:13] that they teach no other doctrine the
[2:39:16] very name fss
[2:39:17] has a strange compound meaning aimed at
[2:39:20] and relaxed the high aspirations of this
[2:39:23] age
[2:39:24] that had begun with the fullness of the
[2:39:27] spirit the depth of god whereby they
[2:39:29] were
[2:39:29] aiming at the high calling of god
[2:39:32] began to give away to a less watchful
[2:39:35] attitude
[2:39:36] unless i ident a less
[2:39:39] added following of christ jesus christ
[2:39:42] began to manifest itself
[2:39:44] as an omen that in the future ages the
[2:39:47] physical
[2:39:48] vehicle called the church would sink to
[2:39:51] the awfulness of the depth of saturn
[2:39:54] it had become relaxed and was drifting
[2:39:57] already the edge was back sliding
[2:39:59] it had left it for its first love the
[2:40:02] tiny seed planted in
[2:40:03] that efficient edge would one day grow
[2:40:06] in the spirit of error until
[2:40:09] all foul bites in the air would rust
[2:40:12] in its branches so inoffensive to human
[2:40:14] reasoning
[2:40:16] would that little plant appear
[2:40:19] to that new eve a new church that again
[2:40:22] should be deceived by saturn the
[2:40:24] efficient age had
[2:40:26] presented to her the opportunity for
[2:40:29] what's
[2:40:29] best and for well she prevailed and
[2:40:32] relaxed and in that
[2:40:34] unguarded and in that unguarded
[2:40:37] moment saturn planted the seed of
[2:40:40] complete
[2:40:41] renation have you had that yes
[2:40:44] you know it doesn't matter how you start
[2:40:46] it matters how you end
[2:40:48] yes you might begin playing fasting
[2:40:51] reading oh with nursing and then you
[2:40:54] become a bit
[2:40:55] lazy that's when
[2:40:59] something will come and and hit you yes
[2:41:02] you see
[2:41:03] so you must really always be on guard at
[2:41:05] every time
[2:41:06] because remember the moments when you
[2:41:07] are on fire the network is not happening
[2:41:09] so when he says you react you will come
[2:41:11] quickly he will come quickly at you
[2:41:13] and that's how you came in at the first
[2:41:14] church
[2:41:18] and then we see that that's how he came
[2:41:20] in and when they got relaxed and he saw
[2:41:23] that's
[2:41:23] the discord there continue
[2:41:27] the very religion of ephesus steps out
[2:41:30] perfectly his first search engine sets
[2:41:33] the tenor of the ages to come in the
[2:41:36] first place the magnificent
[2:41:38] temple of dana that was so many years in
[2:41:41] building housed
[2:41:43] in its safer courts the most beautiful
[2:41:46] las stellas and unobstructed
[2:41:52] and unobstrusive
[2:41:55] image of dinner that one could imagine
[2:41:58] she was
[2:41:58] absolutely unlike any other other images
[2:42:02] sitting
[2:42:03] seated in the other temples dedicated to
[2:42:06] her
[2:42:06] she was simply an almost shirtless
[2:42:09] female
[2:42:10] figure that finally sunk into the block
[2:42:13] of
[2:42:13] wood from which she was carved
[2:42:17] and had two arms or formed of two simple
[2:42:20] bars of iron
[2:42:21] how perfectly it depicts the spirit of
[2:42:24] antichrist
[2:42:25] lost in the first age
[2:42:28] there he has lost in the midst of the
[2:42:30] people
[2:42:31] and yet took no shape as to alarm the
[2:42:34] people
[2:42:35] in the two arms of iron ball said that
[2:42:37] it was his
[2:42:38] intent to crush the ark of god
[2:42:42] as he made his inuit and no one seemed
[2:42:46] to notice him
[2:42:47] or what he was being but one day they
[2:42:49] would notice
[2:42:50] when those arms of iron his deeds became
[2:42:54] doctrine and his doctrine became the law
[2:42:56] of an empire
[2:42:59] the order of temple service is also a
[2:43:02] very
[2:43:02] is also very willing there are
[2:43:06] firsts of all priests who are eunuchs
[2:43:10] this terrible pursuit you say
[2:43:14] austerity over people who would give
[2:43:17] from the life for people who claim to
[2:43:19] know god
[2:43:20] apart from the word as barren as life
[2:43:25] as is asteroids enough secondly the
[2:43:29] temple had within
[2:43:31] its confines the virgin
[2:43:34] priestesses who performed the religious
[2:43:36] acts of the temple
[2:43:37] this showed forth the day that ceremony
[2:43:40] and
[2:43:41] form rituals and ritual and works
[2:43:44] will take place of the holy spirit and
[2:43:46] no longer
[2:43:47] would charismatic manifestation fill the
[2:43:50] temple of god
[2:43:51] over them all was the high priest a man
[2:43:54] of love power
[2:43:55] and public influence portraying what was
[2:43:58] already in progress
[2:44:00] though not too manifested that is the
[2:44:04] church would soon be given over to the
[2:44:06] leadership
[2:44:07] of man man's plans and ambitions and
[2:44:09] thus
[2:44:10] saith the holy ghost would no longer
[2:44:14] be a living reality and underneath them
[2:44:17] over the temple slaves
[2:44:20] who had no choice but obedience
[2:44:22] religious hierarchy
[2:44:24] what can this mean but the day would
[2:44:26] come when the vested clergy
[2:44:28] by political maneuvering state health
[2:44:33] and the substitution of the word and
[2:44:35] spirit for christ
[2:44:37] dogmas and human leadership would
[2:44:40] enslave the lady
[2:44:42] while the leaders laborated in
[2:44:45] ill-gotten world
[2:44:46] and enjoyed their filthy pleasures and
[2:44:49] the poor people
[2:44:51] who were to be served according to god
[2:44:53] now became their servants
[2:44:54] my god this is so happy yeah
[2:44:57] yes very very hearty and
[2:45:01] you find these things that were at
[2:45:03] ephesus
[2:45:05] and later in the age are also today
[2:45:10] here in the churches it's the same
[2:45:13] spirit all through
[2:45:15] the same spirit all to remember
[2:45:19] people die but spirits don't die
[2:45:23] what used to happen then is happening
[2:45:25] today
[2:45:26] but in another card in another way yes
[2:45:29] so we as believers
[2:45:31] should always be on god especially we
[2:45:34] should not let the holy spirit die
[2:45:36] out of our lives we should always
[2:45:38] respect the holy spirit
[2:45:42] when i talk about respect in the holy
[2:45:43] spirit i mean respecting his leadership
[2:45:47] respecting his control and rule over us
[2:45:50] and yielding ourselves to him you see
[2:45:53] those three things
[2:45:54] respecting his leadership whatever he
[2:45:56] tells you to do it
[2:45:58] you know whatever you do
[2:46:01] if he tells you well go and pray
[2:46:04] go pray because you go and do something
[2:46:06] for somebody
[2:46:08] we are going to begin saying people
[2:46:09] surprising one another
[2:46:11] you know you're gonna see someone here
[2:46:15] without shoes having issues and then you
[2:46:18] wonder what happened to this brother you
[2:46:21] know
[2:46:21] and then you you come back and give your
[2:46:23] testimony i thank god i have no issues
[2:46:26] god provided and if you were made by the
[2:46:29] holy spirit you won't even want that
[2:46:30] to mention your name but you find people
[2:46:33] saying
[2:46:34] hey he buys this insanity for someone
[2:46:44] [Music]
[2:47:26] you might be you know having some
[2:47:28] connection with some people some people
[2:47:30] you talk to some people you
[2:47:31] deal with some things you do and the
[2:47:33] word speaking will speak to you
[2:47:34] by the way you people sometimes when i
[2:47:38] say the holy spirit speak to some people
[2:47:42] so how does he even speak someone i
[2:47:44] think is about to ask how does he even
[2:47:46] speak
[2:47:47] do you hear a big voice or a smaller
[2:47:49] voice let me tell you
[2:47:51] how many have ever said something told
[2:47:54] me
[2:47:55] raise up your mind
[2:47:58] okay okay okay
[2:48:01] how many have never felt something tell
[2:48:03] them to do something
[2:48:04] say something is that your hand also
[2:48:10] okay i'll now tell you
[2:48:13] the holy spirit is a person
[2:48:16] it is god it's not a thing
[2:48:20] it is christ in you the hope of your
[2:48:22] birth and what does this say
[2:48:24] he sits on the throne of your heart
[2:48:28] right there to give commandments
[2:48:31] to give rules and to give leadership
[2:48:36] if if i am in libra
[2:48:39] what will happen to me
[2:48:42] i'll become stupid you will behave like
[2:48:46] me
[2:48:47] you wouldn't like me you will look like
[2:48:50] me
[2:48:50] you will talk like me you will walk like
[2:48:53] me there are many chances you might even
[2:48:54] dress like me
[2:48:56] why because our literature is one
[2:48:58] leading and controlling and guiding you
[2:49:00] your life is mine in the same way if
[2:49:04] your
[2:49:04] spirit is sitting on the throne of your
[2:49:06] heart you will do everything like him
[2:49:08] okay and so
[2:49:30] right but when you have the holy spirit
[2:49:33] your holy spirit
[2:49:34] will agree i mean the holy spirit will
[2:49:37] agree with your spirit
[2:49:39] and he will begin giving you
[2:49:40] instructions so it will no longer be
[2:49:43] something like your spirit
[2:49:44] it will be the wrong spirit on the
[2:49:46] throne of your heart confronting you
[2:49:48] leading you telling your faith yes
[2:49:52] to another
[2:50:04] why don't you just get in the news
[2:50:29] new heart new spirit holy spirit once
[2:50:32] you have all that you're going to be
[2:50:34] in complete seat with god you realize
[2:50:36] you are wearing a mini
[2:50:38] a mini skirt or a trouser or whatever it
[2:50:40] is you know
[2:50:41] the clothing and i was talking about the
[2:50:44] other day
[2:50:45] the pastor is not going to go with you
[2:50:46] when you're going to the shop every time
[2:50:48] telling her this one leave it this one
[2:50:51] pass out about this one
[2:50:53] i just want to know about it
[2:50:58] around this one but now you see these
[2:51:01] ones on it
[2:51:02] first
[2:51:08] people think sometimes in that kind of
[2:51:11] perspective
[2:51:13] we totally aware that god wants you to
[2:51:15] dress modest
[2:51:16] both brothers and sisters i am not going
[2:51:18] to go with you to the show
[2:51:20] neither other neighbor is going to go
[2:51:21] with you to the shepherd or the minister
[2:51:23] it is you laid by the holy spirit amen
[2:51:43] [Music]
[2:51:44] yes
[2:51:57] this is a powerful testimony
[2:52:00] [Music]
[2:52:09] you can imagine
[2:52:26] you know
[2:52:55] was you know dressing her whatever those
[2:52:57] things that she has told you
[2:52:58] but when she received the work and got
[2:53:00] provided
[2:53:01] she went and they did shopping no one i
[2:53:04] wanted did not
[2:53:05] go without the shop i didn't buy this
[2:53:07] leave back by this neighbor
[2:53:23] in him he leads you he guides you he
[2:53:25] tells you to do things
[2:53:26] he tells you not to do things right
[2:53:28] brother man
[2:53:30] leads you he speaks to you and you must
[2:53:32] obey whatever he tells you to do
[2:53:35] if he tells you cut off that friend cut
[2:53:37] him off but some of you
[2:53:39] you have the holy spirit speaks to you
[2:53:41] not even through your past i'm talking
[2:53:42] to you speaking to you in your heart
[2:53:45] okay
[2:53:46] this is what you're preaching from the
[2:53:47] past i'm telling you about hearing
[2:53:49] the holy spirit speak to you
[2:54:04] because
[2:54:13] [Music]
[2:54:29] such people said i will accept them
[2:54:45] and when you receive that holy spirit he
[2:54:48] will give you instructions
[2:54:50] he will lead you he will tell you the
[2:54:51] buddha it's no longer how the lord
[2:55:00] is
[2:55:14] because when he sees on the throne of
[2:55:17] our hearts he takes control
[2:55:19] he leads he goes he commands he
[2:55:21] instructs
[2:55:22] he stops he you know he tells you to
[2:55:24] move
[2:55:25] he tells you sit down get out don't rest
[2:55:27] that dress back do this don't do that
[2:55:31] bring in that one and he will tell you
[2:55:33] whatever to do every
[2:55:34] part of your life will be controlled by
[2:55:36] him but some people
[2:55:38] have that kind of spirit you know you
[2:55:40] know
[2:55:41] refusing to be made by the holy spirit
[2:55:43] hallelujah
[2:55:45] praise the name of the lord amen
[2:55:47] hallelujah
[2:55:49] and someone says if i have him tonight
[2:55:51] pray to get him again look
[2:55:53] once you have the holy spirit you are
[2:55:54] saved
[2:55:57] in the presence of him amen amen
[2:56:00] if a man tells you loves your sister and
[2:56:03] you marry them
[2:56:04] and then all of a sudden when you have
[2:56:06] him now
[2:56:08] then he don't want to do what he wants
[2:56:10] you to do you disobey him
[2:56:13] you don't cook for him right suffer you
[2:56:15] don't wash his clothes you don't do
[2:56:16] anything nice for him
[2:56:18] and yet he does everything for you with
[2:56:20] that relationship continue
[2:56:23] if you would reach a breaking point and
[2:56:24] he would say you know what have your
[2:56:26] life
[2:56:27] if you don't love me go back to your
[2:56:28] parents because
[2:56:30] that is a two-way thing it's not a
[2:56:32] rather thing so what's the holy spirit
[2:56:34] once you have your husband you have to
[2:56:36] keep nourishing him once you have your
[2:56:37] wife you have to keep nourishing up
[2:56:39] something so once you have the holy
[2:56:41] spirit you have to keep noticing him
[2:56:43] you have to continue abiding in that
[2:56:45] presence where
[2:56:46] the presence will meet you he will break
[2:56:49] you he will do whatever he wants to go
[2:56:51] with you obeying and
[2:57:06] and so you keep you keep on getting more
[2:57:08] and you know when you make your husband
[2:57:10] out what did he do
[2:57:11] he will bring you a special gift you
[2:57:13] will never have him but now you may
[2:57:14] bring a special gift
[2:57:15] he may bring something nice he may you
[2:57:17] understand why if you have a worthwhile
[2:57:20] he
[2:57:41] so friends we see that in the first
[2:57:43] church in the depression church
[2:57:46] you know they were abiding in the holy
[2:57:48] spirit
[2:57:49] but it says in this show that the
[2:57:52] day that's the ceremony and form reach
[2:57:55] on what
[2:57:56] will take the place of the holy spirit
[2:57:58] from charismatic manifestations
[2:58:00] of god listen lord has never come to
[2:58:02] that spot whereby anything else we take
[2:58:05] uh will take place in our life whereby
[2:58:08] something else will lead
[2:58:09] us but not the holy spirit let us never
[2:58:13] get to that place
[2:58:14] whereby something else is reading us but
[2:58:16] not the holy spirit
[2:58:42] because there is nothing as rushed as
[2:58:44] trying to be
[2:58:45] something you think you are when you are
[2:58:47] known
[2:58:48] hallelujah glory be to god
[2:58:52] and uh and you always have to keep in
[2:58:55] that presence of the holy spirit
[2:58:57] and uh do not grieve him because if you
[2:59:00] breathe him he will leave and when he
[2:59:01] leaves the bible says that
[2:59:03] you cannot be restored again
[2:59:07] judas was not restored again that's
[2:59:10] right
[2:59:10] he he became a son of condition he
[2:59:13] became
[2:59:14] a devil he became you know he his name
[2:59:17] was removed from the beach
[2:59:18] so don't read the holy spirit you are
[2:59:21] sealed until when
[2:59:22] the day of your redemption and keep
[2:59:24] positive all the time don't
[2:59:26] don't you look at the negative things
[2:59:28] that you that might happen
[2:59:30] look at the positive thing that will
[2:59:31] happen because as long as you are
[2:59:33] fighting that presence the positive
[2:59:34] thing
[2:59:34] will happen in your life yes well god
[2:59:38] bless you we'll
[2:59:39] pick it up from there next time
[2:59:50] i'd like someone to come and close
[3:00:08] uh

[3:00:52] this before we end up meeting
[3:00:55] everyone who is not truly convicted in
[3:00:58] their hearts for it
[3:01:00] i advise you not to do it because to
[3:01:03] be able to multiple okay
[3:01:07] do not try it out god is not they don't
[3:01:10] try him out
[3:01:11] they don't monkey you must be ready to
[3:01:14] forsake the world
[3:01:16] you must be ready to yield and give your
[3:01:18] life
[3:01:22] and you give your life to him you have
[3:01:25] to
[3:01:26] repent of your sins what is the
[3:01:28] repentance
[3:01:29] the greatness is the decision to recount
[3:01:33] the world
[3:01:35] to refuse to connect with the god of
[3:01:38] animals to do anything in your life
[3:01:40] to refuse to work in the things that you
[3:01:42] have been working in before
[3:01:45] you repent and yield
[3:01:48] your life to a new thing that god is
[3:01:50] going to be doing in your life you say
[3:01:52] this is what repentance is living with
[3:01:54] the old
[3:01:55] and stabbing the knee and brother only
[3:01:57] if you have two people
[3:01:59] i don't care as long as that person has
[3:02:02] truly repeated because i know you're
[3:02:04] going to feel them in the holy spirit
