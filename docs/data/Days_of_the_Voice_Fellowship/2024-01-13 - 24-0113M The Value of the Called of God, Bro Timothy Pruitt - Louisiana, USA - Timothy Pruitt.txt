minister right away I just want to introduce him a little bit before I introduce him I'd like to say how many have heard brother Timothy PR preached before just raise up your hand okay so the majority have not yet had you pre and uh and uh so I think the expectations then are higher praise the name of the Lord amen it is not easy it was not easy to get brother Timothy PR to come down here I tried it at first with team and I almost almost and then it did not work out and and uh this time when I met brother Tim Timothy PR in Germany I told him brother Timothy that now that we have met you must come down to Uganda and I don't know whether this was a bait I told him this I said we don't want anything from you all we want is your ministry and and uh and so I told him just come pack your backs and and come and minister to us and and brother Timothy you know he's very gracious uh he um when he arrived before he arrived we wanted to book him a place and uh he he was very I don't know whether to say gracious or wise he went behind my back and he booked for himself another place uh but uh uh we are glad that they're comfortable we wanted to take care of everything everything Saint why this man has a Ministry that all of us need to hear and uh his father is one of my mentors in the ministry brother Tim BR and their Ministry in Louisiana is loved all over the world and I tell you many people would love to have them and they go to very few places and brother Timothy has chosen to come to this place and so we want to say it's because God must have laid something on his hand for us here and uh I want you to be expectant in your heart believing that God is going to visit you today in a special way praise the name of the Lord and so brother Timothy was here 30 years ago if he feels lat you will say a little more about that 40 is a generation so another generation is coming on the generation you left here is not this one this is another one and so we are the generation of them that seek the Lord hallelujah we are the generation that is not going to be overcome and I love that brother brother David last night we we are the generation that God has called in this time to overcome we're going to overcome and this morning early morning we were blessed and now we are starting we we we we are getting deeper into the meal so how many expectant I I know all of you are

you for the opportunity Lord to minister to your people we ask these things in Jesus [Applause] nameen amen you can turn to Romans chapter 8 verse 28 also Hebrews 11 and verse 32 just like to say it's good to be with you today I bring you greetings from our home Church from my father brother Tim amen he would love to be here no doubt but circumstances have not allowed it amen so we're thankful to be here with you today and just to share some things that are upon our heart amen God is so good to us amen has he been good to you amen what a wonderful God we serve amen and we'll just get right to the word Romans 8 and verse 28 says we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose amen for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen amen Hebrews 11: [Music] 32 and what shall I say more say for the time which fail me to tell of Gideon of bayra of Samson of jeffi and of David also and of Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant and fight turn the flight the armies of the aliens women Reed their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection and others had true Trials of crew mockings and scorings yes more over bonds and imprisonments and they were stoned and they were sown aunder and they were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted and [Music] tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise amen and God having provided something better for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen amen we let you be seated also like to say bring you greetings from my wife and sister Ruth and also I have four children three of them are married amen I'm moving into the grandpa stage amen but uh we we just want to say it's good to be here with you today I'd like to speak to you on a thought on the value of the call the value of the called of God Amen you have value this morning [Music] I tried to go some I tried to go a different direction many times over the past few days but the Lord kept bringing me back to this place just to ask the question what is truly valuable many times we put too much value on things that are temporary you know this world that we live in is a temporary World our cars our houses whatever we have is All Temporary some place value on themselves too much value some value themselves too little but all the things in this earth and the things that we're going through have no value at all what truly gives you value is not if you're an American or Uganda or from Europe somewhere what gives us True Value is a God plac the seed in us before the foundation of the world Amen what is truly value is not what is temporary but what is that is eternal Amen brother speaks about an old bum that was he was run over by an [Music] automobile and his bones were broken and his arms was broken and blood was running everywhere they took him to the hospital and the doctor looked at him and says there's really nothing we can do here he's all broke up besides that he's he's not really worth anything just wrap him up and let him die and this old fell turned over and said I'm worth something God loved me so much that he gave his only begotten son to me surely if I'm worth something to God I'm worth a few minutes of your time God loves me and he gave his son for me I am worth something amen sure you got a soul that is worth 10,000 words amen you may you may not have many houses or many lands or many cars none of that has of any value whatsoever but you have inside of you a soul amen it's worth 10,000 worlds hallelujah amen Jesus said this in Matthew 10 in verse 29 he said are not Two Sparrows sold for a fary and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your father knowing about it but the very hairs of your head are numbered fear you not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows you know out of the tens of thousands of species of [Music] birds Jesus spoke of a sparrow they don't fly the highest they're not the most popular they're not the most beautiful they don't sing the pretty s just a common bird seemingly worth nothing but not one can fall to the ground without the father knowing about God is concerned with the smallest of things and he said you or have more value than they have you are more valuable to him you are not one little bird can fall to the ground without him knowing about it don't you know if the heavenly father knows about every bird he knows about your need he knows about your struggle he knows about your problem he knows about your issue he knows about what you're going through and you have value Hallelujah you may not be the richest you may not be the prettiest you may not be the most popular but in God's eyes you are valuable in God's eyes he cares for you hallelujah hallelujah so what what what determines value the price that one is willing to pay they could ask uh you know $5 million for this building right here and say that's what it's worth but but if no one's willing to pay that price then it that's not a true value amen what determines a value is the price that one is willing to pay you know some have spent money on something to me that has no value I wouldn't have paid what they paid I wouldn't have gave what they gave some have bought paintings that wor they think are worth millions of dollars I've looked at them and I look at this painting that's supposedly worth millions of dollars I wouldn't give you $10 for it it wasn't a value to me but somebody saw value inside so what we're saying is that what you're getting is worth more than what you're giving amen you know I was just in Belgium and they have a church a Catholic Church there who claims to have a little vial a little bottle of the of the literal blood of Jesus Christ and they walk down the streets with this vow and people bow to it and they lift their hands and they say their words but I I'm sorry I don't believe that's the literal blood but I do know that there's something more valuable sitting here this morning if I did have the literal blood of Jesus Christ and I had it in a little bottle there's something here that's more valuable than that hallelujah amen it's what he gave his life for in other words he thought you was more valuable than his own life you're not the blood you're the purchase of the blood and God thought enough about you that he would come down from heaven and he would come down and he would become me and he would give his life that I might become him amen he thought I was more valuable than all of Heaven hallelujah hallelujah brother brandham says this he says I've often wondered what I would do if I had two drops of the literal blood of Jesus Christ how I would embrace it and walk with it and I wouldn't want to drop it but do you know in the sight of God I've got something greater than that before me today I've got the purchase I've got the purchase of he loved you more than he loved his own life and he gave his life for you hallelujah hallelujah he gave himself he took your shame he took your iniquities he took your sin and he said I found something worth sa hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] amen [Applause] glory Isaiah 43 and verse one yeah you can turn there Isaiah 43 in verse one he says but now thus sayith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee and I've called thee by thy name Thou Art [Music] mine [Applause] Hallelujah think about that your president don't know your name my president don't know my name government leaders don't know who I am but the god of Heavens said I know your name fear not I have redeemed the I have called thee by name amen now what's truly valuable what's truly valuable someone are so happy because a president knows them I could care less I could care less of anybody in the government's new who I was as long as Heaven Knows My Name he knows who I am he knows what I'm going through he knows my struggle that's truly valuable that's true value Hallelujah verse two says when thou pass verse two when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee Hallelujah through the rivers they will not overflow thee though thou walkest through the fire Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee [Applause] amen hallelujah for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopian s why did he do all of this since thou was pre I in my sight Oh Glory hallelujah amen maybe your dad maybe your father he didn't see real value maybe your mother left you maybe people have given up on you but this God has not given up hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he is he said you're precious in my sight you're precious in my I loved you I gave my life for you I give my soul to you you are precious in my side hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah you may have been given up for adoption and you may have been given up in your life your pastor may have given upon you government is given upon you but God is still on your [Applause] side he knows your cares he knows your burdens he knows what you're going through Hallelujah [Music] fire since that was precious in my sight th been honorable and I have loved thee am you say well when when did he begin to love me when did God begin to love me he loved you before there was ever a world hallelu he knew your nature he knew your weaknesses he knew your habits he knew all about you he knew what you was going to be and he looked all over his great universe and he said these words I Choose [Applause] You Hallelujah am he could have chose somebody else he could have chose somebody in another country but he didn't he chose you before the foundation of the world he saw you when you had complexes he saw you when when he had fears and doubts and he saw you in your sins he saw you in your unbelief he didn't choose you because you were perfect he chose you to be perfect he didn't choose you because you was righteous he chose you to be righteous [Music] [Applause] [Music] the prophet of God says that makes me want to scream Hallelujah that makes me want to scream when I think God cares for me I know how it is I know how it is you get in some places people walk away and you're left by alone and you feel like I'm the only one nobody cares nobody understands amen let me tell you he cares I fire you I fire you he brought me all way across the world to tell you to tell you he [Music] cares amen hallelujah hallelujah we have the Assurance he cares for us because while we were yet sinners he died for us we were apart from God but he has made us n unto him and give us the holy spirit with a faith that lifts us up above the things of the world you know brother Brandon was talking about being in a like a museum there were two two men looking at this paper and on this paper they were it was the analysis of a man and he said you know they were telling you how much you were worth in your body the potash and the different he said maybe a man weighing about 150 pounds was worth about 84 cents less than a dollar he said but we'll dress that 84 cents up we'll put a $500 suit on it and we'll put a $50 hat on it and still down inside it's only worth 84 he said I I was looking at this and and he said I tap them two boys on the shoulder he said there's one thing I want to tell you he said you may be worth only 84 cents of the chemicals of your body it might only be worth 84 cents but you got a soul that's worth 10,000 world but if you know we went to a restaurant or somewhere going to get us a nice meal and we got us a bowl of soup and then this soup was a spider in it man we would send that back probably get upset cuz they put something in that soup you know you want to poison me I I'll Never Eat Here Again throw your napkin on the table and walk out he says why cuz you think you're somebody you think you're somebody he said but the devil will come along and poke any kind of old dead religion down your throat and you will receive it he'll put complexes in you he'll put bitterness in you and you will receive it he says why cuz you don't realize your true value we don't realize how truly valuable we really are if we did we wouldn't carry worthlessness and bitterness and fear complexes that has no value it's time to trade in your faults and your failures and your sins and your pride and your bitterness trade all of that in for the crown of life amen for the holy ghost first Thessalonians 5 says it like this prove all things hold fast to that which is good amen you know how quick we are though I'm I'm going to slow down just for a minute how quick we're to hold to our hurts and to what somebody said about us or what this person done to us and we hold on to it and people carry it for years they carry all the hurts and the burdens they carry their past and they bring It Forward do you know if you're if you're if you're living in the past you're your your you are are are destroying

he said if you find out that is right then hold fast another words is get a grip on it don't turn it loose hold it tight hold fast to that which is good or that which has been proven right amen he said now it's possible that stch Christians find people can hold sometimes things that are wrong thinking it is right he said but these things should be proven whether they're right or they're wrong it's the duty of a when anything is in question we must prove is this right or is this wrong how do we prove it not by my ideas or what I think or you think it's only proven by the word of God

feelings of [Music] unworthiness and she put her hands on the scepter of the king Mori came to her he says your people's about to die but you have been brought here for such a time as this go tell the king go tell him what is going on and here she walked in Feeling So Unworthy knowing if he didn't put the scepter out she would die hallelujah hallelujah she knew that if he didn't accept her her life was over with she humbled herself she walked into the king's court and she comes in there and it came to pass she put on her royal apparel and she came to the King's house and the King saw Esther standing in the court and she obtained favor in his sight can I be real personal here right now just going as I feel led but brother brother Buzz bosing sent us a video a video of of of the of the of getting ready and set up and everybody's everybody's expectations first one he videoed was a little girl girl her name was Esther right amen and something spoke to me as I watched that video I said she don't see how truly valuable she is but if she could see it that there is a septer that is being put out amen your daddy may have turned you down family may have walked away but God hasn't walked away Hallelujah and he said you have been brought here for such a time as this Esther I don't know if you're in the building right now but I know this you have been brought here to tear Satan's kingdom down [Applause] and the devil that has tormented you is under your F he's under your Fe hallelujah hallelujah you have found favor with [Music] God but now I'm going to talk to another queen not just one individual but this whole room you have been brought here for such a time as this Hallelujah hallu you have been brought here to tear Satan's kingdom down you have been brought here to put the devil under your feet that's more than just words that's thus sayith the Lord he's under your feet he's under your FEI this is the generation that rises above complexes above fear above doubt above unbelief and SS into the [Applause] heavens spread your [Music] [Applause] wings hallu One Soul one soul is worth 10,000 words people fail to catch the value of a soul therefore they won't support a church with their [Music] attendance to help create an atmosphere where other Souls can be saved but their bitterness has become more valuable to them their Pride it means more God help us to realize the value we [Music] have amen but that's the way it is lot a lot of times people don't see the real value of someone until they don't have them anymore they don't realize the true value of of true friendships until they've done something to ruin it but God sees your value he sees there's something in there that's valuable amen we talked about the little bird God also showed value in a little fish there was a little fish they had caught and the brother had ripped his his guts out because he had used too big of a hook and he said well little fishy I just throw him over on the water and that fish laid there for about an hour but out it was a certain certain moment that the wind of God moved down they were actually discussing some things that had happened and how God had moved in many situations and he said a wind come pouring down through that Valley and he said I heard these words speak and give back the life to that fish I said little fishy in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I give you back your life and the men watching watch that little fish flop back over make a few more movements and go into the water and right at that time I had 30 or 40 sick children on a prayer list and God would go around all of those sick children to bring that little fish up it said he show it goes to show he's interested in everything he not just a god somewhere off you y separated from his creation he don't even know what's happening on Earth but he knows every moment of your life he knows every little detail he he proved it in this generation by the prophet of God just watching him in my room the while uh like yesterday the Deep call it to the Deep would re reveal Secret in lives and it gets so amazed how many details your name is so and so you came from such a place you live at a certain address you have this wrong oh then your brother has this and on and on and on and on God's showing us he's interested in every detail of Our Lives amen amen why would he use his power to curse a fig tree when there were thousands of leopards in the land but he bypassed all of those lepers and cursed the tree and said no man eat from you he used his power showing he's interested in trees he's interested in fish he's interested in Birds he's interested in you he's interested in me he's interested to see his word made man manifest and he's depending on us to do it for we are his agents so if Jesus put value on a sparrow how much more is each one of you he said not one Sparrow will fall to the ground but my father knows about it how much more value are you he knows what you have need of he knows your very heart's cry he knows what you're going through he said he tells about a little girl who wanted to see the king the king of her country and he came through the streets and she waved her little flag and he the king never even noticed her and she just stood there weeping and her teacher came and said what's wrong why why are you crying she said I wave my king my flag to the king I saw him but the king didn't see me brother brand says oh how different it is with the King of Kings you cannot be to little he sees every move you made he knows all about you not a sparrow can fall not a flower can die if you're here sick or Afflicted do you not know the King of Kings is watching over you he is interested in your healing he is interested in your welfare you may be sinful this morning but he's interested in you being saved you say well I'm just an ins significant person you're not in the sight of God God wants you God loves you and when God's love is projected his Sovereign Grace takes his place and it sent a savior to you to redeem you of your transgressions why because God loves you amen it was one morning brother brandham got up and he went outside about 10:00 in the day and he sees this little object coming down the road kind of weaving back and forth he recognized it to be Apostle do y do y they to me they look like a big rat I'm I'm sorry but they're not something that I want to hold and cut or or I want a pet but God was interested they're not something that I think is a very pretty animal they're very they're kind of kind of ugly yeah and there's not something I oh you little cute pum I don't I don't want to touch it but but God was interested amen amen and here she came and laid at his porch she was all scarred and broken up had flies all over her he said he grabbed a rake and he kind of nudged it to see if it was still alive [Music] see the prophet didn't he want to touch it so he grabs a rake and he just kind of nudges and he kind of looked up at him oh it's still alive you know it had said he said I looked and I opened up her pocket little pocket there she had nine little babies laying in there and he said I thought wow what a mother that would that would just try to do everything she can for her babies to live and he said my neighbor Mr wood and his wife you know was kind of a vet veterinarian she said brother brandom just kill that pum and put it out of its misery said the little babies are too small they can't take a bottle he said I I I just can't do that I I well brother brandom you're not going to let that poor thing lay there like that are you she'll die and then babies will die a horrible death you said I knew she was right but something wouldn't let me let me do it he said I'm a Hunter but I'm not a killer and his another brother said well let me let let let let some somebody else kill him I said I just can't he said do you mean you're going to let their lay in that hot sun and and just be scorched to death by the hot sun it looked like the Humane thing to do was to put her out of her misery so he left to go somewhere and he came back in a couple of hours she's still laying there next morning he went out she's still laying there oh well surely she's dead now and he said I kind of kicked her with my foot she Drew up she was still alive his little girl asked he said are you going to kill her daddy he said Daddy can't do it honey I thought oh my that poor mother possum has suffered how much she must love those babies and I was sitting there and something began to speak to me said you were preaching about her yesterday you used her in your text I said that's right you said she was a real mother I said that's right and the voice spoke to me and said I sent her to your door and she laid at your door like a lady for 24 hours waiting waiting for her turn to be prayed for and you never have said a word oh my who am I talking to and I thought oh God is is that you and I walked out onto the porch I went to the Apostle I said God God I know you know every flower you know every sparrow and being that this horrible thing has happened you wanted to show that you can lead animals to my house she's waited for her time to be prayed for I'm sorry Lord Lord that I made her wait I didn't realize what it was God I didn't know what it was or I would have prayed for her but if it Be Your Divine Providence that you have sought this and you want me to pray for that Apostle well I pray for her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ help her father her love for her babies has been so great and when I said that that old mother possum raised up she picked up each little one and put it back in her pocket she walked down the lane just as normal as one could walk she got to the gate and she turned around as to say thank you kind sir and across the road she went and as far as I know she's happy with her babies tonight if God would think that about Apostle how much more does he think about you how much more does he care about you Hallelujah you're not Apostle you're not a you're not a sparrow but you're the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah
