[25:39] amen
[25:40] are you a covenant
[26:05] when you realize who you are
[26:22] amen
[26:34] but when god looks at you
[26:36] he looks at the blood of jesus christ
[26:39] absolutely
[26:40] and what makes the devil not to
[26:42] understand that satanic achievement
[26:45] should be together the perspective is
[26:47] looking at you yes

[30:33] come here but we are child of god
[30:36] god is not blaming you because you have
[30:38] faith
[30:41] because when you face
[30:43] you remain down
[30:47] see amen but remember
[30:55] [Applause]
[31:10] [Music]
[31:26] he said you are not
[31:29] he said you are sons and daughters of
[31:30] god.
[31:34] and the truth is not in heaven
[31:45] can turn that way blessed be the name of
[31:47] the lord amen that that is in us
[31:52] faith because the bible tells us
[31:55] which was in god
[32:25] the deity of jesus christ
[32:40] my life
[32:43] [Music]
[32:57] amen let us go back to that scripture
[33:13] let's all fast the profession of our
[33:15] faith
[33:17] okay 24 and let us consider one another
[33:21] to provoke and to love and to good works
[33:35] not forsaking the assembling of our soul
[33:38] together
[33:39] as the manner of some is
[33:43] but exalting one another
[33:46] and so much the more as you see that
[33:49] they
[33:50] are pushing
[34:30] [Applause]
[34:46] funny

[35:02] amen amen you will try
[35:06] but you will not come perfect like the
[35:07] way they do in the world
[35:12] in the name of the lord amen so what do

[35:15] traitor you need to know where we are
[35:19] yes we are living in
[35:21] him that's longer than we think

[36:10] we are not here
[36:23] but we must stay focused
[36:38] [Music]
[37:05] the price was so big
[37:08] in the messenger the cruelty of sin over
[37:11] what community
[37:13] and what did he do what it takes to
[37:15] drive sin out of our lives

[39:40] even
[40:03] amen
[40:05] light will not darkness will not uh
[40:07] overtake you jesus
[40:48] the bible tells me i believe god made
[40:50] them
[41:19] out of the church
[41:24] people realize who they are
[41:27] and what they are position and what they
[41:30] are positionally
[41:32] never
[41:46] knowing
[41:59] but my
[42:00] influence
[42:02] comes from the kingdom of god
[42:05] there are two kingdoms in this world
[42:13] i'm not talking
[42:25] and you must be influenced from these
[42:27] two kings

[1:27:14] moment
[1:27:18] just want to greet you all in the
[1:27:19] precious name of jesus christ
[1:27:25] i did not expect that i would make it to
[1:27:26] church today
[1:27:31] i was telling the brothers i probably
[1:27:32] need some rest for a few days
[1:27:38] i couldn't even wear my suit today
[1:27:39] nobody stole another suit today i was
[1:27:41] too tired for it
[1:27:44] but
[1:27:54] but also they
[1:27:56] i was we had four days of meetings
[1:28:01] and i thought initially that i had a
[1:28:03] backup plan
[1:28:08] i thought that brother
[1:28:10] elder brother charles of mata would be
[1:28:12] helping
[1:28:27] and so after the preaching we had agreed
[1:28:30] with the past that you will be taking
[1:28:32] we will be alternating the services
[1:28:34] either i take morning it takes afternoon
[1:28:36] i check afternoon tax morning now this
[1:28:38] is the numbers
[1:29:08] so for uh meetings
[1:29:15] sometimes
[1:29:17] [Music]
[1:29:19] fellowship and speaking to ministers
[1:29:37] uh
[1:29:38] at one time we had uh a little
[1:29:41] more than 500 people gathered in the
[1:29:43] same place
[1:29:47] there are no speakers or microphones
[1:29:49] like this
[1:30:28] the brothers they took with me helped me
[1:30:30] to distribute their books
[1:30:34] and to drive sometimes i did most of the
[1:30:36] driving because of the bad roads never
[1:30:39] said it be more comfortable
[1:30:42] so but the lord was good in all name of
[1:30:44] your name will come ali so you
[1:30:46] will get the full report on the videos
[1:30:48] for the first time i think i will
[1:30:50] prepare a video
[1:30:52] uh a presentation to show you to show
[1:30:54] the whole channel
[1:30:59] too to go away without everybody
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:40] i was telling one brother that some
[1:31:41] ministers
[1:31:43] in other countries they take a leave for
[1:31:45] some
[1:31:46] several days or weeks
[1:31:54] and then they you know pray and and you
[1:31:56] know go out
[1:31:58] family you're part of the family
[1:32:01] family and then they come back and
[1:32:02] refresh never come along
[1:32:05] but i was telling him that here in
[1:32:06] uganda if uh one pastor was to do that i
[1:32:09] think many many would judge him and say
[1:32:11] the pastor is becoming cannon
[1:32:18] but uh i think one of these days i'll do
[1:32:20] it i hope not no one will say that i'm
[1:32:22] not
[1:32:44] he said you don't realize that you were
[1:32:46] overworking yourself until you get above
[1:32:48] 50.
[1:33:06] a little longer
[1:33:09] so you need to pray for me
[1:33:12] i i hope that you people love me and
[1:33:14] pray for me
[1:33:17] to appreciate that
[1:33:20] um
[1:33:21] before we we give our offerings
[1:33:25] i also wanted to
[1:33:27] now announce to you i'll announce it on
[1:33:28] sunday but to those of you who are here
[1:33:34] uh we are having a visiting minister so
[1:33:36] you know mueller is again
[1:33:39] during the weekend
[1:33:41] of 22nd weekend
[1:33:46] you'll be with us uh from around 18
[1:33:50] to then to the new for the following
[1:33:52] week
[1:33:56] for just one week
[1:33:58] uh some of you already know him brother
[1:34:00] timothy has been here before i don't
[1:34:02] think in this fellowship but he has been
[1:34:03] in uganda before and also in europe
[1:34:09] he's a son to brother john anders
[1:34:14] but john anders is the pastor of
[1:34:15] anti-messenger
[1:34:17] in uh
[1:34:19] in
[1:34:20] in washington
[1:34:23] zumba we can say anytime tabanoko in
[1:34:25] washington and uh they are great friends
[1:34:28] to us
[1:34:43] uh actually i think his first service to
[1:34:44] preach was for us
[1:34:52] but now the lord is really using him in
[1:34:54] many countries
[1:34:57] and we trust that you'll be a blessing
[1:34:58] too
[1:35:00] so uh also the wedding of
[1:35:03] uh
[1:35:04] brother
[1:35:07] uh brother
[1:35:08] o'kello
[1:35:10] olugando
[1:35:11] i'd like to give him an opportunity to
[1:35:13] come and give us the because i had
[1:35:15] people complaining we don't know nothing
[1:35:17] we don't know anything so brother come
[1:35:19] nowhere
[1:35:24] to manipulate
[1:35:36] i did not have it written here so
[1:35:39] uh just for you to clarify
[1:35:43] you need to know the dates of this uh
[1:35:45] the traditional ceremony and the dates
[1:35:47] of the wedding
[1:35:54] god bless you since
[1:35:56] it's gracious to speak to you this
[1:35:58] evening
[1:36:01] i know last time pastor i clarified on
[1:36:04] this the very engagement day
[1:36:07] and
[1:36:09] previously
[1:36:11] the
[1:36:12] introduction was slated for 26.
[1:36:18] and the wedding is slated for 28th of
[1:36:20] this month
[1:36:23] [Music]
[1:36:36] and then the wedding was slated
[1:36:38] 28th
[1:36:43] when we made some adjustments but rather
[1:36:46] we saw the introduction
[1:36:49] taking 28th of this month
[1:36:57] and then the wedding 4th of june
[1:37:04] but we've been having changes overall
[1:37:06] and um
[1:37:09] as i've been waiting with pastor what
[1:37:11] the truth when he was in karamoja where
[1:37:13] he's been having communications
[1:37:15] with the church in toronto
[1:37:33] is when he talked to me
[1:37:36] and he told me basically
[1:37:38] on his condition
[1:37:41] he's not having
[1:37:42] good attachment with the dick on board
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:55] and i've not been able to carry out some
[1:37:58] activities as usual you know that we
[1:38:00] have to make invitation cards
[1:38:04] oh yes the conclusion is
[1:38:07] the wedding is coming back to kampala
[1:38:09] come away
[1:38:11] this church
[1:38:14] 4th of june
[1:38:17] yes and they they would love to come and
[1:38:19] attend the wedding too
[1:38:22] so that is what i have not yet
[1:38:23] communicated to the church
[1:38:27] so god bless you come on
[1:38:31] amen i mean so you've had
[1:38:36] that is the the introduction ceremonies
[1:38:39] on 28th focus
[1:38:41] and the word in sorority and
