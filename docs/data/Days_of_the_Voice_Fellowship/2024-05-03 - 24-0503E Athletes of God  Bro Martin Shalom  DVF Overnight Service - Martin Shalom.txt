amen amen shall we turn to the book of uh Hebrews 12: 1 are you there let's read in the name of the Lord wherefore seeing we also are compassed about so with so great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of ourth Faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God let us also read uh 1 Corinthians chapter 9: 24 [Music] First Corinthians chapter 9 vers 24 says that know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the price so so run that you may obtain precious Lord Jesus we thank you for the scriptures we have read Lord I ask you that you come down in this few moments are going to spend here that you come and speak to our hearts come and encourage us correct us rebuke us may your word have its full preeminence in our life in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen may the Lord bless you you may have your seat this evening I have a thought that I want us to share and uh I've ever preached this very sermon and I remember I called it that day let us run amen but today I will give it a small title and we shall call it God's athletes or athletes of God blessed be the name of the Lord amen uh I believe all of us I willcome you once again amen and I thank my pastor this evening for giving me this uh opportunity to stand before the purchase of the Lord I just request you to pray for me such that the Lord will speak to you amen our students you're welcome back from school we are glad to have you this evening amen uh this evening I want us to I want to talk about athle but this time not in the world as uh the perspective of the world but in Christianity blessed be the name of the Lord and if you look at where we have read Apostle Paul is referring us with the athletes people who are running in the race blessed be the name of the Lord but Bram preached the message he called the greatest battle ever fought and also if you read that message and the contest they have something similar and uh the same if you look at the scripture and all of us this is something which all of us know like when you're going to run a race you don't just start from the blue blessed be the name of the Lord but there is you spend some good time amen because it is like a a competition you find uh like I remember when we still like in primary school and high school we are given streams or you call them colors the blue colors the red colors the green colors or the lion or the cheatah something of that kind and you'll find that uh before the day of the final competition you will have to do some training blessed be the name of the Lord and here in this scripture we are seeing Apostle Paul telling us that wherefor seeing that we are we are also seeing that seeing we also are compassed about with great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do is do so easily beset us amen you have to first the rehearsal you are doing or the rehearsal we are doing is laying aside the weight and the sin amen because we are surrounded by the great cloud of witnesses and we are looking at the positive Witnesses those who made it amen those are the positive examples We are following and we are looking at and we are having the disciples we are reading of the prophets blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why the Bible is telling us that seeing that we are all so compassed about with so great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do easily beset us and let let us run with patience blessed be the name of the Lord do you know that we are in the rest brother Solomon do you know that you're running the race tonight amen the day you decided or the day you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior you entered in this race blessed be the name of the Lord and we are going to run this race until the final day but this race has the rules and the regulations blessed be the name of the Lord this race has something to do with training the race you're running has something to do with fasting amen reading the word listening to the message blessed be the name of the Lord attending Fellowship praying every day blessed be the name of the Lord those are the things accompaning the race we are running and I'm here to tell you if you are not aware that you are God's athletic elected by God himself blessed be the name of the Lord amen God knows our weakness he knows how little we are he knows how insufficient we are he knows all about you and me blessed be the the name of the Lord but regardless of our wickedness still he shows you because God knows that inside you you have that potential and that potential is put there by God himself blessed be the name of the Lord but most time the Devil comes and scares you he comes and challenges you and tells you cannot make it you look at yourself with all these things in the world you cannot be sa you cannot be born again you cannot be a serious believer but I'm here to tell you you can be a real believer amen you can be a real Saint blessed be the name of the Lord and I'm seeing Saint seated here blessed be the name of the Lord amen we are here to challenge the negative voice because we know most time the Devil Comes and start preaching his gospel to you just look at yourself and the moment you listen and you compromise brother you'll be disqualified blessed be the name of the Lord but the Bible tells us let us lay aside every weight amen you know sin is heavy and righteous is so light amen because Jesus said in Matthew 11: 28 come unto me all those who are y with heavy laden and I will give you rest he says take of me for my yoke is light the devil's yoke is heavy amen but Jesus yoke is light why because Jesus carries his yoke with you but the devil leaves it to you amen blessed be the name of the Lord looking unto Jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him he endureed the cross do you know that Jesus had all means of escaping the cross praise be to God because remember Jesus was God in flesh God was dwelling in that Temple and that Temple is the same Temple you are in and I'm in this Temple has its own desire that's why the prophet tells us that even Jesus was tempted even with sexual Temptation blessed be the name of the Lord that was the body praise be to God and here the Bible tells us yes he despised these other things the cross most time Believers we don't want to endure the cross praise be to God we sing I have decided to follow Jesus but we don't want to endure the cross but Jesus tells us to take our cross each one of you have a cross I have mine you have yours blessed be the name of the Lord and we must carry this cross praise be to God Amen looking at Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God after he despised the shame he seed down on the right hand of the Throne of God blessed be the name of the Lord so each one of us we are learning the race and the Bible tells us to lay aside every weight because we cannot run with them weight we always say that in Christianity if you think that you are cheating us you are cheating yourself sometime we play church and you think you are helping the ministers you're helping your husband your wife your brother your mother your father brother you are helping yourself amen this is the paper which you cannot copy blessed be the name of the Lord the kind of exams we are sitting or we are doing your neighbors cannot copy your answer praise be to God each one of us we are running in different Lanes I cannot run on brother Wang's Lane neither Brother W cannot run on my Lane but sometime and there you're going to be disqualified because the race you're running it has the laws governing it blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to God but remember what we should not forget the rule of the game praise be to God Amen there is no shortcut to heaven the way to heaven is through New Birth you cannot bypass that and God made it so clear that even your father cannot give it to you you have to approach God Alone blessed be the name of the Lord so sometime you may think that you're playing Church you are playing yourself because even me cannot give it to you you have to go to God you have to follow the same same procedures amen for you to receive that blessed be the name of the Lord amen and here the Bible tells us let you are not running alone for your information let us run let us lay aside praise be to God Amen apost Paul in Romans chap 16: 25 says that now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel amen you can only be established according to this gospel praise be to God and the preaching of Jesus Christ the only we can be established in Christianity is is according to the word of God not other things we are trying to do praise be to God and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept sacred since the world began amen and we know that the Mysteries are revealed the secret which apostle Paul is talking about now you know them but what have you done blessed be the name of the Lord amen it says in Galatians 1:2 that for I neither receive it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ the first thing after the you see here in the in the message adoption this adop part three the first thing after the son was was in he became a son but then we find out his behavior is what set him to to adoption whether he behaved right or not blessed be the name of the Lord amen because remember the Bible tells us in Ephesians chapter 1: 5 that having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself blessed be the name of the Lord so my brothers my sisters I don't have a lot tonight but we have to be conscious we have we must know this goes to everyone and if you're doing brother I'm going to call you and you stand in front here blessed be the name of the Lord you cannot run when you are dozing can you you can't they will always look for people who are healthy says that a true Christian because blessed be the name of the Lord but we are having kind of Christians praise be to God that's why but if you look at in athletics they will look for best Runners number one they will check your health and God being a being the master of perfection or being perfectionist that is the same that we are not called today but before the foundation of the world God prepared us for this day amen they want to win the prize and Apostle Paul tells us that we are not running in vain amen there is a reward waiting for us there is a price there is a trophy amen praise be to God so we must know number one why we are running I think it happens starting line [Music] but give it time blessed be the name of the Lord even if you look back in our life there are those people whom we started with and today they are nowhere to be seen others are always bus others are doing this and that in the world Amen and when you looked at them that day that time they were much much better than you but what is keeping you going praise be to God it is because you are following the rule of the game amen that's why the bible say that the rest is not for the sft blessed be the name of the Lord are you running with a vision are you running with a cause are you following Christ with a cause with our purpose amen or you are just coming for for for formality blessed be the name of the Lord that's why even Jesus time came and he had to engage another gear and told them unless you eat my flesh he looked at the congregation and 34 of the congregation they were not Believers opportunistic blessed be the name of the Lord and I believe in the coming of the lord it's like it's delaying because blessed be the name of the Lord God is trying is using his [Music] ceve praise be to God that's why even in the church we have three kind of Believers but when do you tell that this one is to make a Believer let the stuation come in the church praise be to God but when all of us we okay you can't tell praise be to God because me pretends to be a believer the bible say that God allowed them to pass through the Wilderness because he wanted to know what was in their heart praise be to God and that's what God God wanted to see because Moses did not know that the cors and the Dan were there but God had to give it time and raise the sttion blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise be to God so Breen we must know why we are here and we must know what we are aiming for praise be to God you are going for a race and you taking 10 L of porridge you are eating that can't be praise be to God look at the boxers they in fact if you look at boxers and the athletic they have something in common training they preparing their lungs amen their organs their body they have to be physically fit and the Bible tells us that let the physical teaches us the spiritual praise be to God people go to gym because they want want to be fit and I remember one time brother Ken told us this is our spiritual gym amen where we make spiritual muscles nobody goes to gym but when we come to Christ uhuh we make it different blessed be the name of the Lord so we must be willing and be ready to run the race because God shows you he knows that you are the best Runners but most time we want to run with other things you want to run with boyfriend beside you you are running with girlfriend praise be to God we are running with the world the Bible says that heavens and earth will pass away and again brother who is working to go to go to heaven you again running with the world where are you taking your world when the word says it's going to pass away you want to escape the world to Heaven you shall not go there praise be to God Amen without death there is no life butam tells us that unless we are ready to die we are not worthy to live we must be ready and willing to sacrifice praise be to God this life is short we don't know what tomorrow hold we don't know what the next minutes hold amen Anything Can Happen anytime anywhere and sometime when we hear we are also speaking to ourselves praise be to God Amen so God is looking for perfect Runners amen with his Perfection is the one who elects you but remember there must be a willingness in you the kind of Christian you want to be the kind of Runner you want to be amen if you want to be look home it's up to you you will be look but remember if you look at the strategy of the race the first Runners and the last Runners if you look at like relay they will choose the best Runners to start the game and they will choose the best to finish the game in fact the last one they are the super Runners amen that's why through the church ages amen Paul was the best runner he started the race amen and when he reached his dying point he says I have run the race I have kept the faith amen he was sure he knew what he was talking about Paul kept the faith Paul ran the rest and he finished the rest blessed be the name of the Lord amen is dripping with the blood the apostles they kept the rest they ran a good run of fre amen and then we seeing through the age amen [Music] [Music] amen am but when they win the sixth round praise be to God the one for the seventh round was waiting because he was super run praise be to God Amen they trust him that this one is a super Runner praise be to God Amen praise be to God and guess what we are the last Runners praise it be the name of the Lord we are the super Runners amen God is counting it on us you know the parent know those and even some even the teachers because and you forget Mr ha trusted his speed but when it he forgot when he saw the carrots the appetite was faster than the speed and that's why we entangle ourself with the things of the world and for by the time we realize you find when others have already gone ahead blessed be the name of the Lord a Christian supposed to be single eyed amen but sometime we don't want to be a ship you've never seen maybe but i' been in the been to Island when the goat is in the boat it is trouble first of all Fe water there are some Christian like that when the word come ofing the word they're complaining they crying they taking our right brother sister who unto you if you are here but the ship will even relax and sleep blessed be the name of the Lord amen so we are running the rest as long as the prophet says here in the me in the message questions answer that as long as you are in this life you are going to be sticky and have can nature that is going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you are born again hallelu amen but does that does not mean inside of you I'm born again and you do whatever you want no sir but is telling is reminding us that we are human praise be to God we are human beings and we will make mistake in this flesh but as long as inside your soul there is something longing for Holiness that is what matters blessed be the name of the Lord and indeed if there is something inside you you will look for where to fit that something in you you know said today I'm feeling so weak I'm I cannot go to the overnight blessed be the name of the Lord but the that the inside of you you are born again in the message in this Ephesian Church age says this was a part of his eternal and predestinated purpose it was the Plan of Redemption it was the Plan of Salvation now listen closely God being savior it was necessary that he predestinated a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of [Music] being that's why Apostle Paul tells us in Ephesians Ephesians chapter 3:13 14 say that forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before you see but sometime we don't forget we don't want to forget things which are behind us but what we do we bring things which are behind and we put it in front of us but Christianity we must forget things behind us if we are to obtain if you to reach somewhere you must forget things behind you you must forget your past you must forget for get your yesterday amen you must forget your morning and look until tomorrow blessed be the name of the Lord look at what is before you because the Bible says God's Mercy is new every day praise be to God each and every single day when you find yourself alive forget what is behind you forget your tomorrow M your yesterday's mistakes and always think of positiv tomorrow no forget what is behind you forgetting means for means forgetting Amen in Christianity we our our books of account we don't have something like forwarded for another month no when that day elaps forget about what's behind you God what do you have for me today look at your tomorrow blessing be the name of the Lord amen reaching forth unto those things which are before you must reach forth don't just stand you forget and you stand there no reach forth amen praise be to God and I press toward the mark for the price of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus we God don't want his church to go backwards and when the Bible talks of the church not this building can this building go backward you are the church are you going forward or you're going backward sometime you find even the things which you used not to do you again doing them and you don't even you don't even ask yourself of what is happening in your life praise be to God maybe you used not to gamble you find yourself gambling when you have never even done it in your life and you are just okay you think you think you're progressing brother sister no you are deceived you are deceived you use not to attend to have companies of I mean bad companies and you find yourself say you think you're progressing you are not preaching the gospel to them and you also you you also entangle yourself in their Jaz praise be to God they are telling you how as performed and yes you can't tell them how the message performed let me tell you we have a team here praise be to God and that team is called team message you better join that team brother sister and we have people we playing we are playing within this game we have the Pentecostals the Catholics the anglicans Jehovah Witness the Adventist tell them how your team is performing amen tell them how the godhead is revealing in this age tell them about the New Birth blessed be the name of the Lord go visit them and tell them I have a team I want to introduce to you this is the ENT message but you also telling us how they B so and there is a team playing and that is Jesus's team amen and we are versing the devil praise be to God let us forget what is behind us there must be a difference between us and the world our JS must be different amen I remember when we were still at school even my very friends all the people sometime we work with someone comes and speak a big OB word and you find the person apolog so and so I'm sorry but for you when they speak and you all you even praise be to God don't forget that you'll be judged for that there is a day coming the day of judgment praise be to God where we are going to be judged sometime we do things until you even get ashamed to preach to that neighbor viewers because of the way you have been conducting yourself because of the words you have been speaking to them [Applause] amen maybe you a brother and you are just with a girls dir and what how would you start speaking about Jesus because even when you're speaking about Jesus think this is joking you see you cannot run with praise be to God they will tell you let them do what because they know in the race you're going to run you have to be free amen even in Christian walk the we see the reason as why Jesus tells us that where the spirit of God is there is Liberty without Liberty you cannot watch ship God you can't worship God when you're in shanes amen that's why when Paul and Sirus were in jail when they sng when they prayed amen the angel of God came down and the shame broke because they could not worship when they in shame you will never worship God when you are in shame amen you are going to give God lip service when you in shame but God want you to be free hallah that is the true worshiper now the time has come when the true worshipers they will worship God in spirit and in truth why in spirit because where the spirit of God is there is Liberty where there's no Spirit there is bondage amen and without the spirit of God you will never worship God and God want through worshippers who are going to worship in spirit amen and where the spirit is that is where the truth is blessed be the name of the Lord because the word and the spirit is one praise be to God Amen God don't want his church to go backward oh say oh set still sitting still this is the prophet in the message Elijah 1955 God don't want his church to go backward or set still Christian we are not supposed to sit still

just lay it aside praise be to God but to the the whistle of finishing and let me tell you if you're running for 25 rounds and you have moved the 19 20 21st 23rd then you hear the whistle brother sister I'm not talking up I'm not talking Greek [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord if you've ever participated in them races you know when you are starting there's where I reach and you can't even breathe properly but as you keep on going in your mind you have a Target I must be this number blessed be the name of the Lord and as you moving you realize your respiratory system is now becoming okay and okay in time come and now you are okay blessed be the name of the Lord and wait for that whistle and [Music] see so we don't need to be discourage we have to know the troubles we are going through whatever is fighting us it is part of discouragement in this race blessed be the name of the Lord but the Bible tells us let us lay them aside I'm assuring you we are not going to run with anything of the world can see you are not going to make it with it you must drop it amen even if it is just a m Buton you are not going to go to heaven with it it as long as it is antiw you will not make it praise be to God girlfriends always want to see when you are loaded because the wallet is happy and as long as the wallet is happen you are done but the love of Christ whether you are done or you don't have he still loves you 100% as long as you are following his word that's why we s say afraid when sickness lays you down afraid even at last amen Jesus abides with us from our day one when we are born until our last bread on Earth he is always there he will always be there as long as we are following his word we must sacrifice our time amen I remember some years back I had a laptop and in that laptop I had a game computer game in it it was that game of like driving like car assimilation some of that kind time came and that thing became a God to me and you know what God did I not say the devil unless God tells the devil to go work on you there's nothing the devil can steal from even you watch or he cannot take it until God allows him and many time when when such thing happens first ask yourself why has it happened blessed be the name of the Lord sometime even when your phone breaks if to some people uhuh you find that God is just helping you so when I started worshiping this game when I'm from work before even I take water or even pray put on the laptop and I drive through the night and you find me saying hey you know the other you know the devil is so cunning you become addicted to the thing until it becomes like virtual reality you start from zero now you have constructed a company virtual company the guy is taking your time one day I remember I'd G to attend our weekend challenge in Miana thieves came and broke at home they swept everything only Electronics mine for my friends for my clients they took everything this one because I loved it so much I hid it somewhere where even the brother was in the house did not know but when thieves came brother I'm telling you I think they even Leed on that one first it crippled me like for two years so most time when God comes and speaks we think ahh you carry on God has a way of doing his things I had one of my client was a lawyer they stole his laptop with a c word with his note and guess what do you think it was easy for me to come out of it I was like I went before God like Isaiah and I told him what is me blessed be the name of the Lord I pleaded with God and I asked God to help me I prayed and cried to God but thanks be to God he's always merciful those they not through me they told me we've been working together for years you've we never had anything like any comp any negativity again to you so I not pay even one of those items but I'm talking of more than four laptops iPads tablets and even smartphones they took everything the brother woke up in the morning those guys they had their time I think you see but I knew was because of my foolishness and I was a young man blessed be the name of the Lord so don't think that is more tough on the young I used to love football so much until I broke this leg I come to church I mean a new Minister comes from from C Pastor Easter would come and hmer and hmer then after just after the service I would rush there I was not a good football Watcher uhuh but I loveed playing it so much another me Pastor s step would come and Hammer say do you know where this this is a spirit I sayh what show me where it is written you want to you will first lose your arm blessed be the name of the Lord that's why the Bible says Those whom he love he rebuked and correct them and the Hand of the Lord it grabs slowly that's why the prophet even sometime says that sometime ministers should be careful you are praying for somebody you are casting a spirit God is God has put maybe a cast on somebody why because God's hand when it grabs you even if they bring the bulldozer it cannot pull you blessed be the name of the Lord you see if the world people they can do things break down police but it was just of recent when I heard the story about the owner what happened and why even if you go there you will find that gu is like as if it got stuck there yesterday not even a a screw has been removed from it if the world people can how about God how about the of God on you how about the blood of Jesus on you you see even after many years sometime that pain comes back but if I had listened that would have not happened blessed be the name name of the Lord but he knew that I would not run this race with football and world and games beside me amen just imagine if you can spend 6 7 hours playing a video game if you can just divert that and spend 7 hours praying and reading the word where would do you be here you'll be gaining your soul will be growing blessed be the name of the Lord you cannot pray for that hour and read the word for that then you come and do in church you are dosing because the presence of demons are hovering over you you have no Liberty you are bound you are under a chain under the Yoke and the word to pen went through your heart it is very hard the Holy Ghost have to look for this direction again and then because you are not willing to part with your guy blessed be the name of the Lord I was just talking to brother Dan this morning and he was telling how he fought with movies he say time came and could not even speak about it because he was also battling with it he says would wash it up to 9 a.m. but today even if you put there Jack Chan he will not even look there and even if he's looking that side he has no appetite for it what happened if you're battling with meet him and ask him he will give you his testimony but he will tell until he hated it brother that is Spirit it is draining your life some are playing Dy games and you think you'll come and lift your hand say hosana hallelujah those are the sacrifices which God say that you it's like you are you've broken maybe the neck of a dog praise be to God but if we know our cause and our purpose why we are here amen and if we aware we aware that we running in the race and we don't have to entangle ourself with other things it will be different story our worship will be genuine worship our prayer will be genuine prayer because we come when we have prayed up we come when we have through the week we have been waiting on God and the minister will not battle amen because Hearts will be ready Hearts will be charged the blood is applied amen hearts are crying where is God when when can I come in his your presence amen blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] amen it says in 1 Corinthians chter 9:26 I'm finishing I there far so
