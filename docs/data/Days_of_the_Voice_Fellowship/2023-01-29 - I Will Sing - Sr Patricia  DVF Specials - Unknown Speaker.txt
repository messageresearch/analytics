TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] far away a million miles or more it feels dirty [Music] and though I haven't lost my faith I must confess right now for me to pray but I don't know what to say and I don't know where to start but I still keep the grace with all that's in my heart I will see I will pray even in my darkest town [Music] when are you because your word is true I will see all the thoughts and plans [Music] me free foreign [Music] praise [Music] I will see [Music]
