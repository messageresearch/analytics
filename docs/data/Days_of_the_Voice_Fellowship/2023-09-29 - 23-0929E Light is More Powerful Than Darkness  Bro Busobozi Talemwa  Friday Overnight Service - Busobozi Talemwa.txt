when you are going through trouble in your sins is when you have things that you can't explain when you're back at the Heat against us [Music] that worship comes from the heart and the Bible says the

standing let us turn to the scriptures [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] uh my brother you've been lost for a long time I'm happy to see you today God bless you it's good to be in the house addiction of the ginger I just love this young man's commitment we are reading verses 7 to Summer [Music] uh uh out of Zechariah chapter 14. the Korea is [Music] just uh before Malachi verses chapter 14 verses 7. [Music] we just take verse 7 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day no night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light the career isana [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] brother Andrew I don't know how long have you been around just short time and my subject is light is more powerful than darkness is more powerful than Darkness amen Amina praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I mean without without Darkness we cannot be able to see the strength of light actually without Darkness you cannot know the nature of life you cannot know even the power of light but when you have darkness and you've been in darkness when the light shines you appreciate light when when when when light comes you are able to know that light is better than Darkness imagine if you walk into a dark room where you know you cannot even see where you are standing you know you don't know what is ahead of you around you but when the light shines you were able to see that there was just a snake right there and you are just going to bump into it you will appreciate life when when the light shines then you run away from the snakes so you see we cannot appreciate life without Darkness but if you had light all along you can even take it for granted I will not appreciate the power of life you will think it is because of your wisdom and strength that you will run away from the snakes but when it shines if you were in darkness earlier so now you know we sing a song that God the god of the mountains is the god in the valley when things go wrong he will make them right many times we want our God to be the god of the mountains [Music] we don't want him to be the god of the god in our Valley but the truth is life is not only you know uh on the mountain life is a series of things whereby sometimes you go through the valley other times you go through the mountains at times you go through the rivers other times you go through many things so life is a mixture of a lot of things but in the midst of all that God does not change many things change about life [Music] he can do again what happened in the beginning will happen again you know the only thing we need to do is to meet the same condition praise God just to meet the same condition that someone else and you will have the same results did not have a baby and she prayed to God she came at a prayer meeting like this one sometime in the future I'm going to speak to you praise God [Music] [Music] he speaks of the evening time here and we are still dealing with the subject of Elijah in the next few services on Sunday we are having a pastor kabasi could sign the truly he will be coming to minister for us but maybe on Wednesday next week I'll continue with the subject on Elijah and so I was speaking of Elijah and we we found that you see Elijah I'll show you that in the next service I'm speaking on that but when it came time for him to give his offering he gave his offering in the evening time there is something about the evening time the evening time is the end time Hallelujah sometimes God waits for you to go through things the whole day you suffer in the morning foreign [Music] [Music] he was waiting for the evening in the younger stage of this situation it would not happen in the morning at the end of the suffering sometimes Jesus waits for that time when you have given us that time when the situation is so hard that's when he wants to show us because he wants to show his greatness as soon as they buried Jesus they would have said that the man was not dead maybe was just about to die Jesus waited yes the first day of his death when the man is dead when the man is thinking when the man even the man God started to come in his mouth when it is almost a hundred percent sure it was impossible to resurrect him that is when Jesus why did he come at that moment because he specializes It seems impossible maybe your situation is if it is not sinking don't worry it is your situation is Hallelujah he didn't want to come he just healed the sick just to raise a person wondered three days it's a number for Perfection he was perfectly dead Jesus is waiting yes when your situation is perfect to be bad he doesn't want to come when you have five thousand when you have two thousands you say he will begin from here he wants to come when you're completely emptying when you have nothing he is a supernatural God so you can do Miracles [Music] that is a perfect God when Lazarus was already in the tombs they were crying says you know that time when you're beginning to why is it is my finances when you're part when your situation has perfectly going back why didn't you come Jesus money he he looks and he watches when you are going through a hard situation when you're going through a hard drive sometimes you can watch for one two three four five six seven eight oh um [Music] the Bible says Jesus in other words [Music] our Jesus always has a solution of the situation he always has a solution regardless of the situation foreign hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen when you are beginning to complain almost giving up that's when God shows us to prove to you I am the Lord of hosts I am the king of kings he doesn't want to share his glory with anymore he doesn't want you to say because I did this because he wants to take all the glory he wants you to say if it wasn't for the Lord I would not have got here with ginger hallelujah amen and is right here in our night service today and he's telling you you roll away to do the impossible foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah value I'm coming whenever I come to every service and when he spoke that all hell yeah when he speaks has to give you no tombs can hold it no storms sometimes when we preach it seems as if we're just you know repeating that some things foreign [Music] foreign some situations bring sadness situations like poverty oh especially here in Africa in Uganda yeah and you even get out of the spirit but I'm here to encourage it doesn't matter the situation since it doesn't matter the situation when the light of God pushes away and when I preach about it [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign and then he called Lazarus and Lazarus he heard the voice he even when you thought your situation I know I must serve God but I'm dead this situation has finished I don't even have anything that is a good situation when the dead man is this is Jehovah God when he speaks even the rocks can dance he told that if you tell my baby then today against the stones my angel will shout whenever I go to church I don't want the stones to shout if you don't shout in church chairs the world to reach out everything I want to be the one to shout but he can make even the stones to shop foreign the man is already alive um let me tell you Satan has no authority of binding you binding your family your everyday life [Music] I'm receiving inspiration to speak it could be in your life you may be bound in your prayer life when you open your mouth to pray you feel tired that's the chains of the enemies he has no right to bind you from your access to God's blessing Saturn has no right why do I say that I'm saying it with authority because I have my authorities the Bible says see that the son of man sets free he is just starting to bind me [Music] it may even be a you know a lack of a job [Music] to let you go we know poverty we have actually let you go Hallelujah sadness at your business your language [Music] how is business going my name is your language will change your song will change the Bible says [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] thank you foreign [Music] how shall these things oh you can have a jubilee friends no more Darkness and when Lazarus was set free you may be said that when Lazarus was set free immediately he was loosed yes I don't know you but I'm tired of bad situations I am tired of bad situations you love it let us chase away the bad situation let us just a very bad situations to to make us suffer when we have a promise foreign um friends that we fail is our faith fails to believe that we take him as something way of somewhere else when he is right here with us he's just as real in this room tonight as this light is here tonight foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign you tell him try it and try it right now can Darkness even try to come in here the only problem is if this light goes out but if the light is shining Darkness foreign foreign hey Hallelujah God was photographed on the first time since the world was before you've never seen the picture of God we have seen it that same light which was in the beginning which would come down amen man what what do you think that light works the word it was God himself [Applause] [Music] because he did not want to debate what was his name this man once [Music] and he spoke to him and said just move and go to the police hallelujah hallelujah amen he spoke just a few words foreign hmm he was taking pictures when the man went back to check his films Darkness disappears foreign they investigated that picture FBI and he gave a report yeah it was not a reflection on reflection of light [Music] was there who was it yeah God himself God himself he is speaking this today and I believe God is just as real cartoon is that light is just as close as the light is on my hands you know what he was talking about he wasn't presuming yeah he said that God is real yeah here today just like you see that light you know on my head anyone know what number foreign again tell him to try us foreign who is coming to one of the ministers in the convention and he was just you know we're just talking about the schedules and everything and then after I finish I thought it crossed my mind oh God we need a lot of money we have barely even collected 20 to 10 percent where is this money the situation is very hard to understand first we're going through my head right at that moment Ethiopia uh she sent me a scripture the scripture says this it is in Proverbs 17 3 Port is for silver and the furnace for gold but the Lord tries the hearts quickly quickly quickly now this is something Supernatural that happened to me today Proverbs 17 3 English foreign [Music] I told her I gave her some notes to this scripture and I told her the meaning of the Scripture it takes the intense heat to purify gold and silver then [Music] takes the heart the heat of trials for the Christian to be purified um and it clears out anything that gets in the way of of complete trust in him these triers will show that your faith is genuine education [Music] though your faith is far more precious than more Gods when tough times come your way I realize that he wants to use them to refine your faith so the sister told me the spirit of God led me to send you this scripture she says God bless you Pastor and I knew what the scripture means it's another dimension which together so I said in number my sister keep me in prayer she says and I tell her it's a very timely what I tell her about this meaning and I said then because of this meaning this is a very timely message for me and she says listen these are very Supernatural words she says hey you can come and read this story just right here she says amen Pastor God is with you no matter what the devil wants to bring since he doesn't want the upcoming youth meeting he wants to withstand you resist it is easy I mean that very moment when they thought crossed my mind God gives a scripture to test my face I made a stand I made I've made long many years ago I met a stand I am not going to be begging for the ministry if God has given us a vision he is going to bless us again through anybody he will choose we are having many brothers even ministers you know New Zealand from New Zealand whatever it is to give us money to organize youth meetings and then we sent out invitations we are three months away music three one two three days to our youth meeting and the Devil comes to me tells me it's not going to happen it's very difficult but that very moment God speaks God speaks to us your faith is being tried just a moment the Devil Wants doesn't want the youth upcoming Youth mission she tells me um Hallelujah and I I felt I should read it for you because it's not only for me it's for us I told that this is a prophetic message we should resist the devil because he's a standing the devil is seeing what is coming when we came here and sat as a group of about 17 20 young people between them for these meetings he called someone else who told me someone who was not even in this meeting that so-and-so has told me when you were having like big meetings foreign Hallelujah someone doesn't even know the White Brothers but he just saw White Brothers are you doubting I'm not doubting what God has told you in the world must come to pass darkness is foreign [Applause] God is going to provide us with the money we are going to have the youth meetings only one person believes with me God bless we are not going to bed it is I'm giving declaration is here I am not in the flesh I'm in the spirit if otherwise I will not say these things Hallelujah I'm speaking it in the spirit I want the devil to know yes we are going to receive money for our church we are going to receive money for the youth meeting is every yeah every where you can at least have at least 500 young people inside we are concentrating on the youth in our ministry but when we are here sing away today we are going to understand him together yes sir we know the message we have believed that is what about you as an individual hey we cannot know what type of Victory God will give us foreign [Music] with everything you have how much do you pay here [Music] instruments [Music] right Jesus Christ yes sir Christian hallelujah amen that's someone Jesus Christ what response are you alive your individual life foreign [Music] [Applause] he wants us to go through the darkness I gotta treat him pain and suffering we can all be able to say foreign that's what is happening yes God is training you God is
