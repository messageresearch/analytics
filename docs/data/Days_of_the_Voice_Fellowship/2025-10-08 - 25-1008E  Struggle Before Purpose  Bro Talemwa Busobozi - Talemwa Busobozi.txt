And we have come here, Lord, as trophies of your grace tonight in your presence to worship you, to give you glory and honor. We know that this is a part of our worship to give a portion of our time to you. And Lord, as we know that this evening service is not easy for many. But Lord, those that you have unable to come here tonight and even those that are streaming the service today, those that will join us on Zoom tonight. I would like to commit each and every soul into your heart. Help us Lord. May we be a blessing to your brother in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. [Music] The sound is awful. I don't know. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Can you hear me well? &gt;&gt; Well, maybe it is the monitors. You need to really do some work on it, brother. I I'd like to greet you all tonight in Jesus name. You can also greet your neighbor. Um, we are happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening. It's always a blessing to be in the house of God. Amen. Thank you to those who prayed for us. We had a good service in Budo last Sunday. really really the Lord blessed us and uh the saints there they all they they all sent their regards. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this evening I just spoke to pastor Gava of Evening Light by Tabernacle [Music] and he asked me to greet my family and the church. So I bring his greetings as well. evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And um I'd like to also send my greetings to sister Dina. Uh I know she always follows the services and she's a part of this church although from afar. Praise the Lord. I'd like if you can turn to your Bible. &gt;&gt; This evening we are also um streaming for evening light by tabernacle on the on the zoom. So we are reading out of the book of Genesis vers chapter 37. I have a very interesting subject which I want to talk about. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother that is better on sound. &gt;&gt; Uh Genesis 37:23 and we we we are reading up to 27. Amen. Will you pray for me tonight? Amen. And it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his brethren that they stripped Joseph out of his court, his coat of many colors that was on him. And they took him and cast him into a pit, and the pit was empty. There was no water in it. And they sat down to eat bread. And they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of Ishelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicy and balm and ma going to carry it down to Egypt. And Judah said unto his brethren, what profit is what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? Come and let us sell him to the Ishalites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content. You can read it in in Luganda up to 27 23- 27. Uh [Music] Praise God. Amen. Let us pray. Father Lord, we once again want to uh rely on you to say we are relying on you, Father, for this service. Help me, Lord, for the souls that are desiring, Lord, to hear from you tonight. Heal my body, soul, and spirit. And I pray, oh God, that I will not stand in the way of your word, that you will give me inspiration to speak, Father. and Lord also inspiration to the people to hear. Grant it Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Please be seated. I'm speaking on struggle before purpose. I don't know whether that is not fighting. Yeah. Tell your neighbor struggle before purpose. You know sometimes I always tell you to repeat those words is because hearing and speaking are two different things and confession speaking something is usually usually means more to you than just hearing it. So tell your neighbor struggle before purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; On Sunday last I spoke on uh on on on born for a purpose in budo and um I think it was good for the young people because then I was dealing with I've spoken on it here before purpose. I was dealing on purpose with purpose and I said you know for you to be able to overcome many challenges in this life. For you to be able to excel, for you to be able to be prosperous, you need to have a driving force. And that driving force is purpose. There are many that have given up. Many today, even today, as I'm speaking, they're committing suicide. many who are, you know, taking drugs and others have just given up on life. And you know, when especially you try and try and try and things don't seem to work the way you desire them to be. You know, many people give up. How do you know that someone has given up? Someone giving up does not mean that they will walk away from the church or from the fellowship. all that necessary they'll leave Christ. Sometimes they will even stay. But you know someone has given up when they are you know when when they are not motivated when they say let us sing. You'll be like yeah let them sing. Let us clap our hands. Clap for what? They don't know my sadness and Let them clap and you know say hallelujah. Say hallelujah. Hallelujah. Say well. Hallelujah. For what? You know they're not motivated. Someone who has given up is someone who eventually becomes cold when then he started hot. You know he always was coming to church and sitting on the front bench. But now he comes late and sits on the back of bed, you know, he does not say amen to the word anymore. is a bit set back you know and sometimes they even stop coming to church and you know they don't fellowship with the with the brethren and because they don't find a reason to do what those things that I mentioned but you see it is easy to give up especially in this world full of uncertaintities is and I'm preaching to you. I'm I'm meaning you. So do not be absent. &gt;&gt; And even you on Zoom, as long as you're hearing the voice, don't be passive. I'm talking to you as an individual. You as an individual. You know, sometimes when you in church, you are like, "Yeah, the pastor is talking to us. So sometimes you don't hear some things because you say that's not mine. Pastor is not talking to us. God is speaking to you. Praise God. And so I want us I want us to be in the service and do not miss what God is trying to speak to you tonight. And so you become passive and there are many things because this world is full of uncertaintities. This world is full of failures. It is full of disappointments. [Music] Someone you trust so much they eventually disappoint you so big and therefore you decide to give up. You say things I'm tired prayed four years, three years. What have I gained? Have you heard people speaking like that? Those are signs of giving up. The surrendering surrender to faith. A believer does not surrender to faith. A believer drives his faith. You are the one that determines what will be in your life. Or else God would not make us femoral agents. Praise God. If you have purpose, you will stay focused. No matter what happens in your life, you know you're going to be on fire for God. When you are single, you're going to be on fire for God. When you get married, you're going to be on fire for God. When you have children, you're going to have to be on fire without children. But let me tell you if you are going to give up to circumstances there are many reasons you will always have to give up so me I can't go to church I have children you have how many two one about the one who has five have you ever read about Susanna and yet the Bible says with all the children rather history says is that all the children she had she took time to pray with each and every one of them and they all became great. One of them is John Wesley. So you mother many of you are giving up. Many of you are becoming cold. You're becoming indifferent. The fire is going down. Why? Why did you start having the fire? Because you you never had purpose. Some of you never had fire because you had the right purpose. They have the wrong purpose. So let me dance so much so that the brothers can see me, so that the sisters can see me. But after you married, then all the fire ever breaks. because you never had purpose. When you struggle a little bit, you give up. Now, I'm going to speak on something real tonight. Praise God. We should not let the fire be quenched. We should not let our prayer be, you know, uh be destroyed. Our prayer life, we should let the fire stay burning. regardless of the struggles of life. And I'm going to show you tonight, Amen, that every child of God must have purpose. But those who have purpose, Amen, according to the predestination of God, those that are born for real great purpose, they will never attain it easily, there will always be strength. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you feel or think you have vision for how you you want your life to be, you have envisioned your life 5 years, 10 years, 20 years from now. And yet it seems each time you try you know trying to achieve what you have purposeful the more you try to achieve the more you struggle and you feel like sometimes some struggles look like as if it will never happen. Actually many believers die on the line of struggle in the face of struggle. But listen, it is the will of God and and let's just get into the word now and talk about this. That was just to introduce to you a little bit. Now we took a case study here on Joseph and we see that Joseph was hated by his brethren but unlike unlike his brethren Amen. Amen. As opposed to his brethren Joseph was born for a greater purpose. He was different from his brethren. I believe I am like Joseph. Not everyone is like Joseph. Maybe you are like Joseph. But maybe others are Judah, others are whoever or Joseph was born for a great purpose and his brothers did not like him. His brothers hated him. struggle began right in his father's house, right in the comfort of his home. But because there was struggle, that was a sign. He was a boy born for a great purpose. And you know the father loved him and then you know gave him a court of many cows. But you know his brothers hated him. They did not love him. They called him a little dreamer. Somebody who always dreamed dream dreams and everything. You know he was gifted. If you have a purpose in this life, a great purpose in this life, I tell you what, God will give you gifts for it. Each of us here has specific gifts for which you do not need to get an education to be able to know you have them. Are you hearing? There is something you can study from school and you can be able to do it. But there is also something else that you will realize you have naturally speaking. How many people have started one thing and yet made a living with another study what they spend 20 years studying one in one discipline but then they end up spending there eight years 46 years doing completely something else. That 20 years was a waste of time. The 16 years was a waste of time. They they studied that because they told them study that. They started that because they thought according to what? Oh, they look at somebody. Oh, so so and so is a very good accountant. Oh, let me also study accountant. Oh, they just walk and then see someone working in the bank. I am going to be a banker. I want to be a teller. I want to be a bank manager. And then they go try to pursue that and waste six years studying that only to use it for nothing. You see, you were looking at somebody who was living their dream and you thought that was your dream. Each of us is created by God to live for a specific purpose of life. And let me tell you my brother, when you find a day you find your purpose is the day you'll begin to be prosperous. The day you find your purpose, you realize you do not struggle so much to accomplish so much. It happens naturally. Praise God. Why? Because you are living your purpose. Praise God. So notice Joseph. He was hated by his brothers and they said, "Well, they took him out and um you know tried teared his court and um then threw him into the pit, you know, and and then you know Judah said, What does it profit us to kill our own brother? Let us not kill him. Let us sell him to these um Ishalites, you know. Let us, you know, sell him out. And so now I want you to this is vers 37, but I want you to now fast track and go to verses 45. Let's go ahead of it. Ahead of it. Chapter 45 rather verses three. &gt;&gt; And Joseph said unto his brethren, now this is way after, I am Joseph, that my father yet leave. And his brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence. And Joseph said unto his brethren, "Come near to me, I pray you." And they came near. And he said, "I am Joseph, your brother, &gt;&gt; whom ye sold into Egypt." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you read the story, about selling him, about tearing his C, about making him feel bad, about throwing him, you feel so sorry for Joseph. But brother, sister, that Joseph might as well be you. Maybe you have been treated like that by people that were supposed to love you, by people who are supposed to be there for you. But let me tell you, my brother, nothing happens by accident to every child or daughter. Amen. If you know you a child of God, nothing has happened in your life by your act. Good or bad. I said good or bad. Even what you don't want to talk about. It happened for a good cause. As long as you are born of God, you were predestinated. You were in his mind before the foundation of the world. His eyes always watch for the sparrow. His eyes has been on you before you were born, after you were born, all through this life's journey up to the end of your life. In your life, his eye has always been on you. And his eyes will never cease to be on you. And he says, I've inscribed you in the palm of my hand. Amen. So you are all right because you are in his hand good or bad happening. It does not mean your purpose has failed. It actually means that it is driving you to purpose. And Joseph many years later his his brothers come to him and he tells them look at me I am Joseph your bride whom ye sold into Egypt. Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that he sold me hither. For God did send me before you to preserve life. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For these two years has the famine been in the land. And yet there are five years in the which there shall be neither be here earing nor harvest. And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. Amen. God made his brothers to sell him so that he will go to Egypt and become a great man that he will go there before them that they will all come after him. [Music] Do you know it is because of Joseph that the children of Israel came to Egypt and they gave them a beautiful land. Did you know Goshan was a very beautiful place, very fatty land that that the Pharaoh who knew Joseph had given to them, he told them, "Take that piece of land and put your people there because Joseph was royalty and so they got this good, beautiful piece of land." Oh, I want you to follow me closely. And you know it was because of Joseph and it was not because of him. It was because of the act of their brothers of his brothers. They sold him &gt;&gt; so they can get refuge. Hallelujah. Believe it when the Bible says all things work together for God. Roman Romans 8:28. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know. Tell your neighbor. We know. We know. How many now know we know that all things not something not something? All things, good and bad, evil and righteous. All things work together for good. to them, &gt;&gt; not to everybody, but to them that love God, to them are the call according to his purpose. [Music] So now I'm talking about the people of purpose. To these people, my brother, all things work together for good. Oh Lord, I did this. I did that. This happened in my life. They did this to me. All things work together for good to them that are called according to his purpose. And God sent me here to preserve your posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. [Music] So now it was not you that sent me. Hallelujah. But God but God. Hallelujah. You know this word h is here &gt;&gt; and I preached on it before but God but also it is there in the book in in the New Testament he says but God who is rich in mercy and now here also Joseph says but God amen. So it was not them it was the mercies of God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That sent is that sent him into captivity. &gt;&gt; And he has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all of his all and and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Israel. Praise God. I want to show you God has a pattern and his pattern never changes. before any divine purpose is manifested for your life for a season. There will always be a season of struggle, &gt;&gt; brother. Interpret that correctly. There will always be a season of struggle. That's not an accident. Is God's pattern. Every seed must fall into the ground and every seed must die and then it will bring forth much fruit. Hallelujah. That's what it says in the book of John 12:24. Very verily I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone. Unless it falls in the ground and die, it abides alone. But if it falling and if it die, then it will bring forth much fruit. [Music] Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If there is no death, there is no multiplication. There must be death so that multiplication can the struggle is a dying process. It is the breaking of the outer shell so that the life inside Amen. The life inside the call begin to be expressed. There is a life in you my brother. The purpose of God in you God. But God by his sovereign mercy and grace has allowed you to go through the struggles of life so that his purpose can be revealed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And you realize that so it is so easy for somebody. Let me tell you, if he's a child of God, it's never easy for anyone. If you see God blessing someone with some material thing, don't ever think it came easy. Don't take a shortcut. go through the process, there must be a struggle before purpose is revealed. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. For every victory, there will have to be a trial. Amen. In a message, what is that in your hand? A prophet says, "Oh, Moses said, I can't talk very good. Lord said, "I'm kind of slow of speech." He said, "I just can't do it." He said, "Who made the mouth of a man?" Amen. And begin to really calm Moses down. That's the way God does, brother. He shakes you down. He And then he shakes you down and build up again. Mhm. Amen. God is is breaking you. Some of you, God is still breaking. Even as a church. Amen. God is breaking us. Amen. Even as a ministry, God can allow things to happen in a church. Why? Because he's breaking us into different pieces so that he can build us up. That's the way the people today. You don't like to be broken. You get broke broke up. You got to be broken up before you can be remade. The prophet went down to the potter's house to get broke up to get on the wheel and span out something different. If you are a sinner, get on the wheel. God will break you down and he will mold you different. He will shape your life up different. He will shape your home life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Depending on what you are going through. Some of you if you have a lot of gossip, God will take you through situations that will break you that will break you and break all the gossip out of you. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. If you have a lust or if you have one of these demons still in you, you cannot sit on the throne with those still tagging along. And so he takes you through a struggle. Takes you through the fire. Amen. So that you can drop all those things. Amen. Hallelujah. And then you will emerge out as someone who is remodeled according to his purpose. That's the law of preparation. The struggle is not to destroy the believer. to form Christ [Music] as we shall see if I get there if time allows me. The greatest purpose, we have a lot of purposes. Each of us as individuals. Amen. You have to find your purpose. But all of us as a seed of God, we have one major purpose and that purpose is that Christ may be seen in us. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. But the purpose of God even to send us this message is so that the bride will become the mystery of Christ. He wants that when we stand Christ will stand. When we are seen he will be seen when we speak he will speak. And that's why I'm called the third pool, the third phase. And many people think it comes easy. There is a process. And it's the process I'm speaking about today. You have to suffer to reign. God has to mold your cover. Something has to happen in your life. You have to struggle, brother. You have to struggle, sister. You have to go through what you are going through. Yes, I know you know what you have to attain and God knows you know it. And when it seems as if you are getting it then things happen. It is all part of the plan. It's all part of the process. He's molding a character. Amen. Is driving your life to come to purpose so that you will know. You will know that you yourself will know this is what God has envisioned you. This is what God has desired that I will do. Amen. That's the Lord preparation is to bring us to a place where the word can live through you. The struggle is God's secret workshop. You know, Joseph's pit was not a mistake. The pit where they threw him in, it was not a mistake. Hallelujah. Haha. Some of you have fallen in some pits. Well, I'm looking at angels, who have never had any peace who have never fallen into any pit. But I tell you what, my friend, I have fallen in many pits in my life. But I have good news for you tonight. Amen. those pits that you fell in, it was God's reaction. Before he could stand before Pharaoh, he had to stand alone in a prison. Joseph was in prison. Alone in. Why? Because God was preparing to stand before Pharaoh. Amen. Moses's desert was the place where God stripped him from all the selfconidence and replaced it with divine dependence. Some of you, you have a lot of self-confidence. Don't you ever think God will send you do what you know you are supposed to do until you get divine dependence until you lose all your selfconfidence. Education trains you to to have self-confidence. But the Holy Ghost, Amen, trains you to have divine dependence. Well, like David, you can say, "Amen. I look to the hill from where cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord who made heaven and earth." Now I understand. It's not what I know. It's not what I can do. It is what God will help me to accomplish. Even Paul, he had to go through the desert of after his encounter, not to be punished, but to be processed. Some of you are going through your desert, don't think it is bad. Don't think bad about that fear trial because according to God's purpose in your life, he's processing you and the process is different. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. It depends on what you want to make. Amen. If you want to make a thinner paper or a bigger paper or whatever, the machine will be different and the process will be different. Don't you ever be uh you know envious of what others have. Oh, God. What about me? Oh, come on. Enjoy the process. God is preparing you for a cow, right? But for a better person, God is preparing you according to your his purpose in your life. The process is different. Struggle is all right. It's God is secret workshop. The prophet said in possessing the enemy's case was only a few years later when the trials come and the church got all shook. And as is so easy for a congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way that it should be that it's supposed to be. God makes it that way. God brings tensions into the church, tensions into the family, tensions into relationship, tensions into your heart, tensions into your life. Every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven, tested. He le sickness strike you. He lets disease come on you and test you and prove you and show the world that you are truly the seed of Abraham. He permits it by his own will. Hallelujah. He permits disaster. He permits the friends to turn against you. He permits all these things and turns the devils loose to tempt you. &gt;&gt; What? And he will do all I take your life. Why are you still alive? You are alive because you have a purpose. Regardless of what has happened in your life, regardless of what you think was bad, let me tell you, there is a purpose. The fact that you are alive and you can hear the word. Amen. Don't put your eyes on what happened before. The Bible says putting off your eyes from that and you look to what is coming. Look to what God promising his word concerning your life because purpose always looks to vision is always the end goal. What will happen? After the trial after the struggle, my brother, we are going somewhere. My sisters, let me tell you, this is not your end. You are going somewhere. As long as you are alive, you are going somewhere. There is a target to him. There is a purpose to accomplish. Don't give up. Look at the purpose. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He could throw you on a bed of affliction. &gt;&gt; He could turn your neighbors against you. He could turn the church against you. Amen. He can do most anything. That's why you must never hate. [Music] I feel like jumping right because I feel like I I have to be. I don't know where. Why I'm speaking friends is coming from another dimension. That's why you have to love everybody. Don't hate anybody because if they did something to you, it was God who allowed Joseph turned to his brethren and told them, "Hey, my brother, you think you sowed me?" No, no, no, no. God himself sent me here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But they even got money pieces of sh. But Joseph is telling them, "It was not you, my brother. It was God. So it was not your brother. It was not your sister. It was God who allowed it for a purpose." Amen. Amen. He could throw you into anything. He can do most anything good and bad. &gt;&gt; And it is it is God's will for him to do it. We are told that it is more precious than gold to us. [Music] So the struggle is where God's leadership over our lives is proven. That's where purpose becomes character. And character is what holds the anointing because God gives you the anointing for your purpose. But you need character. Without character, that anointing can kill you. You need character before the anointing comes. So then God will allow you to go through things before he anoints you. So have a clean heart. Look at Joseph. He told his brothers, "Don't be guilty. It's not you, it's God. Look at David. When this man came stoning him, God wanted to kill him, they said, "No, no, no. Don't do that. God has permitted him, to abuse me, to stone me. Who am I to go against God?" His heart was pure. To the pure, all things are pure. Look at Jesus when they stoned him and they killed and they beat him and they spotted him and they called him. They called him the devil himself. He never had a beaten heart. He forgave them. Why? He in him was purity. In him was life. Look at Steven when they stoned him. and tried to kill him. He he was able to see the big picture. And he said, "God, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing." My brother, my sister, when you when your mind opens to another mind, to revelation, you will cease to see things naturally. [Music] Whatever happens around you, you will always have one scripture in your mind. And I know for all things, all things work together for good. Amen. Why? Because I am the call according to his purpose. Because if Steven had not said, I forgive them, father, forgive them, soul would not have been saved. and you would not have been healed. So it was all God's purpose that Stephen will die and he will become a matter that Saul will believe and he will become Paul and he'll preach the gospel and today we can talk about Jesus and say we want to be like him. It is all God is great big s what has happened to you I am here to tell you &gt;&gt; oh my god I remember when the angel comes when he came to brother he said I've come to speak to you about your misunderstood life and I'm also telling you what is happening to you is all part of God in the big picture. No one did anything to you that is bad. God permitted it for a purpose. You never did anything that is bad. That's bigger now. Yes. Don't be on this good side. Be on the bad side as well. Even the things that you did that you are not proud of, God allowed you to pass through that life. Why? For the great big picture. You open your eyes into God's great purpose for your life. [Music] Then you will stop looking down. You will look up shoulders and say I am a son of God. I am here to fulfill God's divine purpose for my life. Praise God. Amen. The struggle identify his true sons. A struggle is not a sign of rejection. It is a sign of sunship. If you are without chastisement, the scripture says, you are an illegitimate son. No sin. We all don't want chastisement. We don't want to struggle. We don't want to go through pain and suffering and this and that. But the Bible says if you after coming to Christ don't go through it you are illegitimate you are not a son you know I've seen many many years I' have been preaching the gospel that almost when someone comes to Christ and they believe that's when their family will come up against all hell will break loose someone told me pastor after he baptized me the problems became worse and the devil is trying to share to tell them that is a false teaching that's why you are suffering and you know what God allows that so that he will test you are you a true son or you are an illegitimate if you a true son Those trials, those sufferings, those struggles will purify you. They will embolden you into the word. It struggles identifies the true son. I am in the scriptures. By the way, Hebrews 12:7, if you and your chesting, God dealeth with you as with sons. For what son is he whom the father chastiseth not? But if ye be without chastisement, what are all our partakers [Music] of we are chastised. We are partakers of chastisement. If you you have ever lived in a home We with with children that are born in the home and the children who are not. You know a true father will always call his sons and his daughters seriously. But this other one he will go slow. Why? Because this one will never understand. [Music] He'll just speak and say, "What's wrong with you?" And this boy will just say, "This man is a monster. Take a phone. I'm living with a monster." So, a true father in the home. If I never biologically gave birth to somebody, I have a limit of correction. But to a true son, biological son, that one I can scroll. I can pull ears. I can sl say what have you done. Because even after scolding him, come back to me. I'm sorry. Because even if you feel bad, you will never run away from your daddy. Look at children. When they sad, they run going back to their mommy or their daddy. Even after chastisement, true son are chastised. Are you a true son of God? [Applause] And he says if if you don't have chastisement, then you are bastards and not sons. So when you are truly born again, God will not let you escape his dealing. He will deal with you. He will take you through fire not to harm you but to manifest the goal of your faith. In church age book Ephesians chapter 8 says worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of Christ. Worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of Christ. And as gold is malleable, &gt;&gt; whereas brass will break with the bent beating. This God of God, hello God of God, Hallelujah. Amen. This God of God will bear her suffering for the Lord. Not bowed, not broken, not destroyed, but formed as a thing of beauty and joy forever by the trials and testings of this life. If you are the God of God, you must go through that. That's why before your purpose manifest, your faith must be proven genuine. The struggle exposes what is real and burns away what is artificial. We can't go in by pretending. We have to go in in reality. If we came from there, we have to go back to our true origin. Not by pretense, but in reality. You see, purpose without process produces pride. You see, in the natural, a child born before its time is premature, you know, is weak, unable to survive outside the womb. And you know spiritually it's the same thing. If God were to bring you into your purpose without first taking you through the process, that purpose itself will destroy you. The Bible says in Hebrews 5:8, "Though he were a son, yet lending he obedience by the things which he speaking of Christ." Philippians 2:8. And being found in a fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death. He became obedient. &gt;&gt; How? by the things which don't think Jesus just obey to die. He had to suffer. He had to be molded into that kind to obey death. This is somebody who was a son of God. He could speak another word and disappear. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you something? You are like him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The potentials he have, you have. But you have to suffer like he suffered. So you can reign with him. Hallelujah. You see, he obeyed unto death. Even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also highly exalted him? After what suffering and given him a name which is above every name [Music] that's why weakness proceed precedes strength. Praise God. Strength comes after weakness. Weakness first then strength. The struggle humbles you so that when the purpose come, God alone receives glory. Some of you cannot get promotion because there is still more character molding to do. Some of you can get a job because there is still character mold in you. Some of you cannot get married because there is still character mode. Some of you can get money to buy a house, buy a car. Whatever you think you need, whatever you think you are entitled to, there's more character molding. You feel you have a calling of God, ministry or whatever it is, but you're not quite getting it because there is still character molding. And that's the bitter being. But church, I'm asking you to swallow it. Submit yourself to the will of God in every struggles of life. Don't ever see it as negative. Learn to thank God and stop complaining. &gt;&gt; Philippians 2, I'm about to say Philippians 2:9. Wherefore God also has exalted him and given him a name above all name which is that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ to the glory of God the father. Now even the Lord Jesus did not escape this process. [Music] Though he was the word made flesh, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered. Before the resurrection came, Gethsemane happened before the crown came the cross. All of us know that but we don't want to carry our cross. He says carry your cross and we have different crosses. If that was the path of the pattern of of the pattern son how much more his many membered body. So when the bride goes through suffering, it's not punishment. God is not punishing you. It is identification with the world. When the purpose of God is about to unfold, let me tell you what happens. The enemy will fall pressure. You can say I've suffered. But when you reach a moment and say I have suffered enough that is the moment don't give up things about to happen. When you reach that moment of saying enough is enough. It mean you are reaching a moment of your of the manifestation of your purpose. the closer Joseph came to the palace, the darker it looked. The closer Jesus came to Calvary, &gt;&gt; you remember the cross became heavier. Hallelujah. And the devil was speaking to him, "Give up. Give up. Give up." &gt;&gt; But I'm God so glad he never gave up. And because he never gave up, I will not give up. Hallelujah. I will carry my cross and I will follow Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While you are there murmuring that, oh, I'm not married. There is someone married for 20 years without a child. And whereas you are saying, oh, I'm here 10 years without a child. There is someone who has children every year and they die every year. Stop murmuring. Just focus on the purpose. Whatever your cross is my brother, my sister, bear your cross. Follow Christ without memory. That's the law of contrast. The dark hour, the darkest hour just before dawn. Hallelujah. The Bible says he sit us in the thickest of darkness. Well, if you think you're in that moment, he's about to show it's about to become a new morning. Oh, God. Stop crying like a child. Start believing and confessing victory in the middle of your struggle. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I know I'm I'm a bit off for Zoom, but I'm finishing in 5 minutes because I know you're being blessed by this. Praise God. Even as you look away to Jesus, it's tightening. He says, "And when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you are pressed out, then watch what I'm I'm fixing to tell you. Watch the third pull." [Music] In other words, the greatest manifestation of purpose which is Christ in his bride comes also through pressure. Hallelujah. The struggle is not the end. It's the signal that manifestation is near. A true believer doesn't inter interpret their life by circumstances but by the word. The struggle is not random. It is scriptural design. If you can see that your hardship is God's hand, shaping his purpose in your life. Then you will stop muring. You will you will start yielding. You are going to be available when everything is good. You'll be available when things are bad. When the grain is threshed, it's not destroyed. It is separated from the chaff. You know, it doesn't mean you're destroying it. You are going to begin the work of separation, the chaff from the wind. So let the struggle do its work. It is producing a vessel fit for the master. You know they take it and beat it and beat it. It's a separation going on. This struggle is here for the master's use. Let us stand on our feet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, these words that have been spoken today. Lord, perhaps it was for somebody. Oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; would you help us to no longer look at what is happening, the circumstances, May we look at the purpose. There is a purpose in me that must manifest. Lord Jesus, help me to understand. Help me to see, oh God, beyond what is around me and do so for my brother, my sister. Bring them to that realization that mammaring is not the answer. Crying is not the answer. Self-pity is not the answer. But faith, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; is the answer. &gt;&gt; No matter what happens that their eyes are stayed on the purpose that they can be all together be able to say. And we know that for all things work together for good to those that love and are the cold we know all things, not something but all things. Bless everyone Lord. And as we dismiss tonight, may your presence dwell there. Grant it I pray in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us sing one or two songs so we can worship him a little bit and before we give our offerings, [Music] &gt;&gt; oh Lord, surround me, oh Lord.

Thank you for reminding us we should stop murmmoring. We should stop looking to the left or to the right. We should focus on your word, on your promises. Amen. We should focus on what you have said in your word for us, the purpose that you have for our lives. Lord, may you help us, oh God. Help Abra, every brother, every sister. We will come into that place. Amen. Of confidence. Confidence. No matter what happens in our life, we should have confidence in your purpose. Knowing you can never fail us for no matter what happens in this life. We are being molded Lord into that stature of a perfect man.
