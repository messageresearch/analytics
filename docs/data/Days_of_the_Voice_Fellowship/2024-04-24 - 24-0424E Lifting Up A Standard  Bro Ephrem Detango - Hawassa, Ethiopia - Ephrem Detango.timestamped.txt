[51:06] attention in in in the
[51:10] beginning you see God wants to have a
[51:14] fellowship God loves to have a
[51:18] fellowship because he wants to have his
[51:21] own
[51:22] Fellowship his own church
[51:26] created an
[51:30] Eden and he placed Adam and Eve in that
[51:36] Eden but you see the devil will
[51:39] come and turns God's
[51:44] Eden Satan's
[51:48] Ed he comes and deceive
[51:52] Eve he comes and deceive the perfect
[51:55] Fellowship

[52:16] came in that
[52:18] Eden and turns God's
[52:22] Church Satan's
[52:26] and right
[52:28] now we are living in the most deceitful
[52:33] age more than that was in the
[52:36] beginning more than the days of
[52:39] Noah more than the days of
[52:42] Moses more than the days
[52:45] of
[52:47] Jeremiah more than the days of
[52:50] oiah we are living in the most deceitful
[52:54] age and the devil come with all power he
[52:59] has to
[53:02] deceive the very elect
[53:05] one as it was in the
[53:07] beginning so we see God wants to have a
[53:12] fellowship and he created an
[53:16] Eden every
[53:19] evening he comes to
[53:22] Adam and to Eve and he preaches someon
[53:27] and the sermon he
[53:28] preached it was life for
[53:31] them they don't know about
[53:34] sickness they don't think about
[53:37] tomorrow they don't think about any
[53:40] disase there is never accident they
[53:42] don't
[53:43] know they don't know anything about
[53:47] failure they don't know anything about
[53:51] Sin but you see the devil will
[53:54] come and insert his
[53:58] deception and turns the God's
[54:02] Eden to
[54:05] Satan Hallelujah hallu let us read a
[54:10] quote it says how can I
[54:15] overcome paragraph
[54:17] 44 it says
[54:20] we this age that we are living
[54:23] in it is one of the greatest
[54:29] this
[54:32] church is the greatest of all Church
[54:38] ages because it is the ending of
[54:42] time and blending of
[54:46] Eternity and then it is the greater
[54:49] sinful
[54:52] age it is more seen in this age
[54:57] than there ever
[54:59] been and the power of
[55:01] Satan is more times
[55:05] higher to fight against than it was in
[55:08] any
[55:10] age Hallelujah it is saying the most
[55:14] sinful
[55:17] age is not just
[55:19] Ephesus it is not just
[55:21] sermania it is the age that we are
[55:24] living in
[55:26] the devil is coming with all power he
[55:30] has to deceive you to deceive your
[55:34] identity to deceive your
[55:37] potential to deceive your faith in
[55:41] God this is the age and he's coming with
[55:45] all power he
[55:47] has Hallelujah and there is a battle we
[55:51] are facing
[55:53] my and when the scripture when the talks
[55:56] about
[55:58] Sin it is not talking about
[56:01] adultery it's not talking about lies it
[56:05] is more than
[56:06] adultery it is more than about Li it's
[56:10] more than about it it is about
[56:14] deception it deceives you it will take
[56:18] your
[56:19] identity you will not know who you
[56:22] are hallelujah hallelujah but the
[56:25] scripture we read
[56:27] when the Devil comes like a
[56:29] flesh also God is coming to raise up
[56:32] your
[56:34] standard Hallelujah he shall lift you up
[56:38] he shall increase your
[56:40] standard
[56:42] hallelujah
[56:44] amen I want us to go to the message
[56:48] called Satan's
[56:52] aen 69
[56:56] and
[56:57] again it is a religious
[57:00] [Music]
[57:02] sin as it is in the
[57:06] beginning so
[57:09] [Music]
[57:10] deceitful as it was in the
[57:14] beginning as it was in the
[57:17] Eden it was so
[57:21] deceitful watch it now it's not just
[57:25] purely old everyday
[57:29] sin committing
[57:31] adultery getting drunk and using God's
[57:35] name in
[57:36] vain that is not
[57:39] it no that's not it it's telling us here
[57:45] it is not just committing
[57:46] adultery it is not just speaking lies it
[57:50] is not using God's name in vain there is
[57:54] something more than that that is very
[57:58] sinful that is going to deceive the
[58:01] bride
[58:03] Hallelujah and in paragraph
[58:06] 7 it says you remember years
[58:11] ago many of you here the old times
[58:16] remember that the sermon I
[58:18] preach on the disappointment at the
[58:23] Judgment the harot
[58:26] she ain't going to be
[58:29] disappointed she knows where she is
[58:32] going the drunkers ain't going to be
[58:35] disappointed
[58:38] there the both
[58:40] leers the compers the Liars the theves
[58:46] he is going to be they are not going to
[58:48] be
[58:50] disappointed but the
[58:52] man who thinks is right
[58:56] there is a
[58:59] disappointment
[59:01] Hallelujah the man who thinks they know
[59:03] Jesus
[59:05] Christ it is here telling us the sin
[59:09] that we are talking
[59:11] about is a religious
[59:14] sin because every time what they
[59:18] do they will tell you we know Jesus
[59:21] Christ they will tell you when you come
[59:23] and join our church
[59:26] now you have the right connection with
[59:30] God they will come with a religious
[59:34] dress the same thing that the devil did
[59:37] in the
[59:39] beginning he he didn't tell her that
[59:42] he's a
[59:44] devil he didn't tell her that he's going
[59:47] to deceive
[59:49] her he came quoting a
[59:53] scripture he came uh what the what God
[59:57] have said before to
[1:00:00] her he came quoting the scriptures to
[1:00:05] her but the things that he
[1:00:07] does he will take away a small
[1:00:11] word and take away the life from
[1:00:14] it so that's what they doing
[1:00:17] today they will tell you they know Jesus
[1:00:20] Christ they preached Jesus Christ but
[1:00:23] when he was passing through them they
[1:00:26] never recognize
[1:00:28] him why they were
[1:00:33] deceived they never recognized
[1:00:36] him they were calling him you
[1:00:39] B you are the
[1:00:41] devil but they go every Sunday to to the
[1:00:45] church and they preach the gospel and
[1:00:48] they will say a messiah will come
[1:00:52] through a virgin
[1:00:54] bu when he passing
[1:00:57] through they never
[1:00:59] recognize the life they live it
[1:01:03] out
[1:01:05] Hallelujah that is the dangerous
[1:01:07] deception we could
[1:01:11] ever and they will tell you we have the
[1:01:14] life and they will point you to
[1:01:19] themselves they don't point you to the
[1:01:21] to
[1:01:22] Christ they point you to their
[1:01:24] denomination
[1:01:26] they will point you to their to their
[1:01:29] faces they will point you to their
[1:01:32] intellect they will point you to their
[1:01:36] denomination but we thank the Lord Jesus

[1:01:43] standards he has increased our
[1:01:46] standards that we can see through it
[1:01:50] all Hallelujah so there is a battles we
[1:01:54] are facing

[1:02:33] but they never know Jesus chist they
[1:02:35] claim they know Jesus Christ and they
[1:02:38] kill Jesus

[1:02:46] Jesus
[1:02:47] Christ but they will take away the life
[1:02:50] from
[1:02:51] it and they will give you their identity

[1:05:42] glorious time of all
[1:05:46] ages because we are facing the greatest
[1:05:49] Millum
[1:05:53] again we are facing the aen
[1:05:59] again but right at this
[1:06:02] age all the
[1:06:05] dece every
[1:06:07] tactic that he ever
[1:06:11] used and being able to deceive
[1:06:15] wh he is gathered all
[1:06:20] together and reforce himself
[1:06:25] came down like a
[1:06:29] god not as a
[1:06:31] devil he's not just
[1:06:33] coming he's reinforcing
[1:06:37] himself to
[1:06:39] come and
[1:06:41] deceive not like the
[1:06:44] devil but as a
[1:06:47] god he's coming preaching the
[1:06:50] word he's coming telling you all what he
[1:06:53] can do
[1:06:56] he has reforced
[1:06:59] himself and come to deceive the
[1:07:02] bride if it was
[1:07:04] possible he could even deceive the
[1:07:08] elect that is how much serious he
[1:07:11] was he's reinforcing himself
[1:07:17] down but right at this
[1:07:20] age all the
[1:07:22] dece and every tactic that he ever
[1:07:27] used and been able to deceive
[1:07:31] wi he has gathered all
[1:07:35] together and reforce
[1:07:38] himself and came down like
[1:07:42] God and has put himself in a place of
[1:07:47] God
[1:07:49] religious and can the
[1:07:52] scripture and can tell you the scripture
[1:07:57] just as Satan did to
[1:08:00] Eve the Garden of
[1:08:02] Eden but leave all live out one
[1:08:08] spot out it it's all has he
[1:08:13] do make that
[1:08:15] Gap where the poison doctrine of the
[1:08:20] devil can pull
[1:08:23] through like the thinking man
[1:08:27] filter was talking about the other
[1:08:30] night so he will
[1:08:33] come and he will leave out one
[1:08:37] spot out of
[1:08:39] it that is what he does he comes with
[1:08:43] the
[1:08:44] scripture but when the scripture tells
[1:08:47] you that you're going to
[1:08:49] live going to twist it and tell you that
[1:08:53] you're going to die
[1:08:58] yes dressed up with a religious
[1:09:02] dress coming to come to attack the elect
[1:09:06] one if it was
[1:09:09] possible to come and attack the one and
[1:09:13] deceive Hallelujah let's read
[1:09:18] 66 in the days of
[1:09:21] Noah he explained
[1:09:24] that impossible for it to rain from
[1:09:29] Heaven There is no rain up
[1:09:32] there he his great scientific
[1:09:36] gospel that he preached in the garden of
[1:09:40] Edy he could shoot the instrument to the
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:45] moons and prove there is no moisture up
[1:09:50] there but God
[1:09:53] said there would be a rain
[1:09:56] but Satan
[1:09:58] succeeded and poisoned the minds of the
[1:10:02] People by a scientific
[1:10:06] research it could not be
[1:10:09] done that it was
[1:10:12] done God said it will be
[1:10:15] done and it was
[1:10:17] done I'm here to assure you when God
[1:10:21] said you have done
[1:10:22] it because he has seen it you over
[1:10:25] already done
[1:10:26] it that is how true the word of God is
[1:10:31] and he has told you that you have done
[1:10:34] it he has paid you
[1:10:36] price and he has sacrificed all the
[1:10:39] payment he has paid all the
[1:10:42] price and that is real ass sure as it
[1:10:46] is hallelujah the devil cannot take away
[1:10:50] that from you the denomination cannot
[1:10:53] take that away from you
[1:10:56] any person cannot take it out you
[1:10:59] because it is Assurance at it
[1:11:02] g is so personal with you and the
[1:11:06] God nothing comes between you and the
[1:11:10] word it is so personal for
[1:11:14] you it is your own
[1:11:16] life it is your own
[1:11:20] self Hallelujah when you are reading the
[1:11:24] word calling up your name it is calling
[1:11:28] up your name it is calling you to the
[1:11:31] word hallelujah it is speaking about
[1:11:37] you hallelujah
[1:11:41] hallelujah but the Devil
[1:11:44] comes he tried to take away some
[1:11:48] words and made you feel like you are not
[1:11:53] worthless you don't belong here
[1:11:56] hallelujah hallelujah we are here to
[1:11:59] prove the
[1:12:01] devil that he he came to a wrong person
[1:12:05] today he came to a wrong place
[1:12:08] today today is not his
[1:12:11] day today is my day that I'm going to
[1:12:14] increase my
[1:12:15] standard I'm going to increase my
[1:12:18] standard I'm going to rise up Hallelujah
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:25] we thank
[1:12:27] God and in
[1:12:29] 67 paragraph
[1:12:31] 67 it says now in the days of
[1:12:37] Jesus he did the same thing he poisoned
[1:12:40] their
[1:12:42] minds Again by
[1:12:45] dece misinterpreting the
[1:12:48] word if thou be the Son of
[1:12:52] God now let me see you do something
[1:12:58] Hallelujah so we see the devil is
[1:13:00] quoting a
[1:13:02] scripture so that is telling me I should
[1:13:06] rise my standard
[1:13:07] up I should increase my standard than
[1:13:10] more than cting a
[1:13:12] scripture more than speaking in
[1:13:15] Tong more than
[1:13:17] prophecies there should be something
[1:13:20] that I should be looking
[1:13:22] for is more than cting the scripture
[1:13:25] it is more than quoting the
[1:13:27] message Hallelujah the standard should
[1:13:30] make a
[1:13:33] difference and that when the standard
[1:13:35] did make the
[1:13:36] difference the anointing will come and
[1:13:39] took ever Hallelujah when the anointing
[1:13:43] comes that will make a
[1:13:45] difference a difference between
[1:13:48] Pentecostal
[1:13:50] Church Mage Church the difference
[1:13:53] between a man God called
[1:13:57] man and a man called
[1:14:00] man Hallelujah there should be a
[1:14:04] difference between God called
[1:14:07] man and just man
[1:14:10] called the anointing
[1:14:12] comes that will make the
[1:14:15] difference
[1:14:19] Hallelujah when we read the scripture of
[1:14:21] Ephesians chapter
[1:14:23] 1 we
[1:14:25] that Apostle
[1:14:28] Paul he confidently said
[1:14:31] it I the Apostle of Jesus Christ he know
[1:14:38] for sure that title was not given by a
[1:14:42] man he know for sure the title he
[1:14:47] received was not by a man it was not by
[1:14:51] a
[1:14:52] peer it was not from some denomination
[1:14:56] because when the Devil comes at you he
[1:15:00] doesn't care about the purpose he
[1:15:02] doesn't care about your
[1:15:04] titles Hallelujah but there is something
[1:15:08] that touch
[1:15:10] poor he said the
[1:15:13] Apostle of Jesus Christ he knows for
[1:15:18] sure he called by God he's not called by
[1:15:23] a man he not sent by a man he is sent by
[1:15:28] God and God will take care of him
[1:15:31] [Applause]
[1:15:32] Hallelujah that's why when we see
[1:15:36] Elijah he got in a very hard
[1:15:39] time where there is no food where there
[1:15:43] is no people but there is something that
[1:15:46] he sure
[1:15:48] of he is called by
[1:15:50] God and when he was in the
[1:15:53] desert he didn't call for some
[1:15:56] denominational
[1:15:58] church he didn't look for a paper who
[1:16:00] have sent him
[1:16:02] there Hallelujah all he does is he
[1:16:07] looked above and he called upon God and
[1:16:11] God came down
[1:16:13] himself and sent his
[1:16:16] fire and send what he
[1:16:18] wanted because the
[1:16:21] ministry and the vision is not of a mind
[1:16:25] it is of God hallelujah so when you take
[1:16:29] full charge of
[1:16:31] God take care of you he will be with you
[1:16:36] because for sure you know you are called
[1:16:39] by God you are predestinated by God
[1:16:46] hallelujah
[1:16:48] amen when the anointing
[1:16:52] comes it makes the difference
[1:16:56] hallelujah hallelujah whether I'm a
[1:16:58] preacher whether you are a student there
[1:17:01] should be a
[1:17:02] difference between quoting a message and
[1:17:05] living the life of the message there
[1:17:08] should be a
[1:17:09] difference between TI
[1:17:12] preachers and God-fearing
[1:17:15] preachers
[1:17:20] Hallelujah theyy to please when the ti p
[1:17:26] when when they see there is someone is
[1:17:28] paying a good TI that personage that
[1:17:31] person whatever you are doing you are
[1:17:34] doing good keep it up we are with you we
[1:17:37] will support you yet they know they are
[1:17:40] going to hell Hallelujah when the
[1:17:44] anointing comes it makes the difference
[1:17:48] between a TI
[1:17:49] preacher goding
[1:17:51] preacher Hallelujah
[1:17:55] hallelujah
[1:17:57] hallelujah because there is nothing that
[1:17:59] will stop Apostle
[1:18:02] Paul from preaching whether there is
[1:18:06] death whether there is
[1:18:08] persecution whether there is a soldiers
[1:18:11] going to arrest him he knows for sure
[1:18:15] who has called him he knows for sure
[1:18:18] whom he's working for he knows for
[1:18:22] sure
[1:18:23] Hallelujah you know for sure who called
[1:18:26] you you know for sure who who
[1:18:29] predestinated you
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:32] Hallelujah we thank the Lord for
[1:18:35] this that God has called me and God has
[1:18:39] called you those he called he elected
[1:18:44] and those he elected he justified those
[1:18:47] he justified he has already glorified he
[1:18:51] didn't say he will glorify
[1:18:54] he said he already
[1:18:57] glorified hallelujah hallelujah you are
[1:19:00] in his mind
[1:19:02] before appear to appear
[1:19:05] here you appeared in God's
[1:19:09] mind for sure you know where you're
[1:19:12] going
[1:19:13] to Hallelujah
[1:19:15] Hallelujah God has called
[1:19:18] you and that calling should be so
[1:19:21] precious for
[1:19:23] us hallelujah
[1:19:28] amen God is increasing our
[1:19:31] stand hallelujah hallelujah I want to
[1:19:34] talk about why did God came
[1:19:39] down why what makes God came
[1:19:44] down
[1:19:47] Hallelujah why are we preaching about
[1:19:50] the second coming of Jesus
[1:19:53] Christ and and why did God came down to
[1:19:59] earth Hallelujah I want us to think
[1:20:02] about that because for sure it will open
[1:20:06] many of our
[1:20:10] thoughts because many people they will
[1:20:12] come to
[1:20:13] you and they will tell
[1:20:16] you something that is not in the
[1:20:20] scripture we should know why God has to
[1:20:24] come down
[1:20:29] God didn't come
[1:20:31] down to give you a
[1:20:34] promotion to give you a
[1:20:37] car God didn't come down to give you
[1:20:40] better
[1:20:43] life that is what the church looks like
[1:20:47] now they will tell you that you're going
[1:20:50] to get these things you're going to get
[1:20:52] that things you're going to get your
[1:20:55] promotions yes for sure we know we
[1:20:58] you're we're going to get that
[1:21:01] promotion yes you're going to be
[1:21:03] healed if you're coming for that
[1:21:07] purpose to this church to this
[1:21:11] church you will miss a great
[1:21:14] point but if you're coming for the car
[1:21:18] promotion or a job promotion yes you'll
[1:21:21] get your promotion yes you'll get what
[1:21:24] you
[1:21:25] yes you will be
[1:21:26] healed but you will miss the point
[1:21:30] again what is the main purpose of you
[1:21:33] coming
[1:21:34] here what is the main purpose of God
[1:21:37] coming
[1:21:38] down Hallelujah that's why I said before
[1:21:43] the anointing should make a
[1:21:45] difference between curse breaking
[1:21:50] preacher the word open preacher
[1:21:55] Hallelujah there is a big difference
[1:21:58] there
[1:22:00] Hallelujah yes you're going to get your
[1:22:03] healings yes you're going to get your
[1:22:06] promotions but there is something bigger
[1:22:08] than that there is something bigger than
[1:22:11] that there is something your soul is
[1:22:14] lacking Hallelujah there is something
[1:22:17] your soul is
[1:22:20] thirsty
[1:22:22] Hallelujah hallu God
[1:22:26] comes because he
[1:22:29] cares he cares for his
[1:22:32] word he has made a promise
[1:22:35] already Hallelujah because of his
[1:22:39] what God cares made him
[1:22:46] come made him come because in the
[1:22:50] beginning the church was deceived
[1:22:55] he had created an
[1:22:57] Eden and he placed Adam in Eden in
[1:23:02] that and the devil will
[1:23:04] come and deceive this
[1:23:07] church Hallelujah and made it
[1:23:12] Satan's so now God is coming
[1:23:16] again in
[1:23:20] Satan's Hallelujah to have his own
[1:23:23] church
[1:23:25] so we are in Satan's
[1:23:28] aen but we are of God's
[1:23:31] Church
[1:23:35] Hallelujah God has come to open a church
[1:23:41] to tell the devil now I have a church
[1:23:45] and this church will not
[1:23:47] fall this church will never
[1:23:50] fail because this church is myself
[1:23:55] I have died for it and my blood has paid
[1:23:58] the price for
[1:24:00] it
[1:24:02] Hallelujah are you in that
[1:24:04] church are you in that

[1:24:58] 98 it says and the
[1:25:01] message that Martin Luther
[1:25:05] brought of
[1:25:08] justification was all
[1:25:11] right for Luther's
[1:25:13] age that's as far as it
[1:25:17] went
[1:25:20] sanctification was
[1:25:22] F in wile's age
[1:25:25] that's as far as it
[1:25:28] went then we come into Pentecostal

[1:26:33] the church I'm here to tell you Church
[1:26:37] it is time to play church it's not time
[1:26:40] to play the church because God is here

[1:27:14] any
[1:27:15] denomination the name is just attached
[1:27:18] to one thing
[1:27:20] only and that is the name of Jesus

[1:27:57] standard standard is more than
[1:28:01] justification is more than

[1:29:18] beginning as it was in Eden he wanted to
[1:29:21] commune with people
[1:29:24] to commune with his
[1:29:25] own so God put

[1:29:38] 15 what is the Holy
[1:29:41] Ghost God in you what is it for to

[1:30:02] beginning he is now trying to do it
[1:30:06] again he's trying to solve the
[1:30:10] problem he's trying to commune with the
[1:30:15] people trying to bring his church
[1:30:20] together to bring the church to one
[1:30:23] place
[1:30:25] to a place in this
[1:30:27] day far beyond the
[1:30:31] lutherans
[1:30:34] Methodist it is a place to
[1:30:38] adoption the Rapture
[1:30:41] Grace that with this part of the
[1:30:45] church when the spirit moves in the
[1:30:49] church it will just raise
[1:30:54] and will bring
[1:30:56] forth bring forth all the
[1:31:00] redeemed that is touched in that
[1:31:03] Spirit Hallelujah when he brought
[1:31:07] himself
[1:31:08] forth when he pours him Spirit
[1:31:11] forth whoever received that
[1:31:15] Spirit Hallelujah will be to
[1:31:20] him will come to
[1:31:22] him because those are the
[1:31:27] redeemable and he will bring forth all
[1:31:29] the
[1:31:31] redeemable that's touched by the
[1:31:34] spirit Hallelujah those
[1:31:38] lutherans who stood there with all the
[1:31:42] light they
[1:31:43] had in
[1:31:46] deification those
[1:31:48] Methodist they fell on that
[1:31:52] floor they thow the water in their
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:57] face from the spirit
[1:32:01] sprinkle them through
[1:32:04] sanctification those
[1:32:07] Pentecostals they walked up and down in
[1:32:09] the
[1:32:10] street and called them Tong of
[1:32:14] L they called themselves Tong of
[1:32:19] L and in gospel language
[1:32:24] all that they
[1:32:25] say they will stand in the
[1:32:29] righteousness in the sight of
[1:32:32] God the day just as certain as in the
[1:32:36] Bible stands
[1:32:38] here if you believe me to be a
[1:32:42] servant you call me his
[1:32:45] Prophet I don't call myself
[1:32:48] that but you listen I'm telling you in
[1:32:52] the name of the Lord
[1:32:54] those that are in Christ will God bring
[1:32:59] forth with him at his
[1:33:02] coming the
[1:33:04] resurrection and one of that are in
[1:33:08] Christ you are in Christ you are in
[1:33:12] Christ you have his spirit so he is
[1:33:17] responsible to come for you and redeem
[1:33:21] you because in the Eden
[1:33:25] it came for fruit it came for
[1:33:29] sin and for that sin he's coming to
[1:33:33] redeem his
[1:33:36] own and take back to his
[1:33:39] church Hallelujah are you one of
[1:33:42] them are you one of them are you one of
[1:33:47] them hallelujah
[1:33:49] hallelujah that's why we we see pressure
[1:33:54] in this last
[1:33:57] age a pressure that was not there
[1:34:01] before in the battles we are
[1:34:05] facing is not like in the days of
[1:34:08] Noah it's more than
[1:34:11] that and there is a
[1:34:14] pressure in the
[1:34:17] bride that is that is
[1:34:21] attacking in the spirit of deception
[1:34:25] and you see this
[1:34:27] pressure when you see before a plane
[1:34:30] takes
[1:34:31] off you can see in the
[1:34:34] engine there is a lot of personalization
[1:34:37] going
[1:34:38] on there's a lot of pressure going on
[1:34:42] there is a lot of pressure going
[1:34:44] on Hallelujah for the plane to take
[1:34:48] off and until the plane takes off
[1:34:54] pressure will have to
[1:34:56] pressurize pressurize
[1:34:59] pressu
[1:35:01] until plane is above the
[1:35:05] clouds and now everything will
[1:35:08] become everything will be settled
[1:35:12] Hallelujah there is some
[1:35:15] pressure that is attacking the
[1:35:19] believer there is some
[1:35:21] pressure that was there in the days of
[1:35:25] and the Bible
[1:35:27] says God
[1:35:30] hardened the heart of pharaoh to apply
[1:35:34] the
[1:35:35] pressure on Moses because if there is no
[1:35:38] one
[1:35:40] pressure there could be a
[1:35:43] comfort there could be a sleeping so
[1:35:46] because God
[1:35:48] cares he applied the
[1:35:50] pressure he allowed the pressure to come
[1:35:55] so he can push
[1:35:57] Moses to the
[1:36:01] limits he increases his
[1:36:04] standard Hallelujah there is a pressure
[1:36:07] that will come in this
[1:36:10] AG that will allow
[1:36:13] us to see our
[1:36:15] potential that will allow us to come to
[1:36:19] our
[1:36:19] fullness that will allow us to call
[1:36:23] Christ and speak his word
[1:36:28] hallelujah there is op
[1:36:32] pressure Elijah was
[1:36:35] pressurized he was pressurized and
[1:36:38] pressurized until the Chariot came and
[1:36:43] took him away Hallelujah and Moses has
[1:36:46] to be
[1:36:48] pressur for him to reach his Promised
[1:36:52] Land
[1:36:53] Hallelujah so there must be a
[1:36:56] pressure that's why the Bible tells
[1:36:59] us Jesus Christ is not coming on the
[1:37:04] earth to come and take his
[1:37:07] bread the Bible tells us we shall meet
[1:37:11] him on the cloud on the air so there
[1:37:16] must be a pressure for us to rise up
[1:37:20] there must be a pressure for you to rise
[1:37:23] up
[1:37:24] there must be some pressure for you to
[1:37:27] speak the word there must be some
[1:37:30] pressure for you to apply the
[1:37:33] token Hallelujah there is a pressure and
[1:37:37] that pressure will lift us up we lift us
[1:37:41] up we lift us up until we see Jesus
[1:37:45] Christ
[1:37:47] Hallelujah
[1:37:49] Enoch W with God and he was found no
[1:37:55] Hallelujah there shall be a
[1:37:57] walking there shall be a walking because
[1:38:00] the bride is for sure will be
[1:38:05] raptured Hallelujah that is a sure
[1:38:09] blessing
[1:38:12] Assurance Hallelujah

[1:55:59] today is from a man that has really
[1:56:01] studied the
[1:56:03] message he loves the message with all
[1:56:07] his and you know he has been also a
[1:56:11] standard that God Has

[1:56:18] enemy amen the bride is that standard
[1:56:23] the message is that

[1:57:01] the holy spirit in
[1:57:03] US is a standard that God has amen
[1:57:08] raised the enemy cannot
[1:57:11] defeat amen no matter what he does
[1:57:13] around
[1:57:15] us God also has a
[1:57:18] standard you know God looks at the Devil
[1:57:22] and then he looks at his bride and then
[1:57:25] he say what about
[1:57:27] that if you've if you've wasted
[1:57:31] everybody what about
[1:57:33] thatu what do you say about that I am so
[1:57:37] glad I am one of them I'm so glad I'm
[1:57:41] one of
[1:57:42] them and when Ephraim was about 16 17
[1:57:45] years
[1:57:47] old you know I was I I I always remember
[1:57:50] that whenever I see him preaching
[1:57:54] you know I was together with my
[1:57:57] wife and we saw him coming out of the
[1:57:59] house of his
[1:58:01] mother and that would be the first time
[1:58:03] for us to set our eyes on
[1:58:06] him and the Holy Spirit spoke through my
[1:58:09] lips told my
[1:58:11] wife that he's going to believe the
[1:58:14] message and he will be a
[1:58:17] preacher and at that time he was just
[1:58:19] playing how do you call that game
[1:58:21] brother ephra
[1:58:23] basketball
[1:58:24] yeah he's a very good B he used to be a
[1:58:27] very good
[1:58:29] basketb it was not into the religious
[1:58:31] things and
[1:58:33] preaching but I tell you what that was
[1:58:36] not me it was God seeing through the
[1:58:41] future and seeing that he's going to be
[1:58:44] one of the
[1:58:46] standard that God will raise you know
[1:58:49] the message is the standard the word is
[1:58:51] the standard
[1:58:52] the holy spirit is the stand but you see
[1:58:56] it has to work through a
[1:58:59] vessel and we are that
[1:59:01] vessel and today seeing our brother
[1:59:04] preached such a a powerful uh
[1:59:08] sermon I've just been
