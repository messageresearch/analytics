Please, shall we turn to our Bibles this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just beautiful, wonderful to worship the King of Kings. He is the Lord of Lords and he that is one. I just greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ. you once again in church. Can you please turn to your neighbor and tell them what we're happy to be in the house of the Lord? Brother Steven, I'm happy to see you. Bless you, sir. Amen. We are going to the book of First Timothy, chapter 2. And we are reading uh the verses we read on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Chapter 2 vers uh 5. [Music] For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who will have all men to be saved and to come to the unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. Amen. Shall we say amen? Brother Shalom, can you come up here just a moment? You may be seated, please. &gt;&gt; If you look in Isaiah 43, and if you look at Isaiah 43:11, it says, "I even I am the Lord. And beside me there is no savior. Amen. Amen. In Isaiah 44:6, he says, "Thus sayaith the Lord, the King of Israel, and his redeemer, the Lord of hosts, I am the first and I am the last. Beside me there is no God. [Applause] Praise the Lord. And we can go on and on. Isaiah has a lot of these nuggets. And he keeps on calling himself the savior. God. So who is our savior? God is our savior. So if Jesus is our savior, Then that means that Jesus is God in flesh. [Music] Not the second God or the third God but the God Jehovah God. Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new because there is no other savior. There is only one savior. And in the Old Testament he said I am the savior. Beside me there is no other. And so but you know then we understand it is the God the Jehovah of the Old Testament who at that time was in the form of a spirit. He put on flesh and he dwelt among us. And the Bible says we beheld his glory. the the only glory begotten of the father. Full of grace. Oh, don't you love that? Full of unmmerited favor. Full of grace and truth. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so then here in Paul tells Timothy, "For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior." Amen. It is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior. Have you come to watch a movie tonight? Have you come to have church tonight? Can we have church tonight? I hope we can have church on Wednesday night. Praise the Lord. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior. God our savior. Again, who is our savior? Paul emphasizes God. The man who is speaking these words He's the man who hated the Christians. He's the man who killed Christians. He's the man who hunted Christians. &gt;&gt; But he was a religious man. He was a Jew. He was a Pharisee. Trained among among the best of them. And he he believed in God. He believed in the God that I read to you about in the book of Isaiah. and he believed him to be the only savior. And he saw this these Christians running around with a man called Jesus and he never understood. How human being can worship another human being as if he is their savior. He couldn't understand that. So he hunted to kill them one by one. and his name was Saul. And one day as he was going to hunt them, he was with a band of soldiers. He was moving in power and great authority because he had a license to hunt and kill them. Here he meets a group of people. when he meets uh something and um when he reached this place um you know a light came from heaven what we call a priy and he recognized it because he knew that this is the same God that appeared to Moses. He had no problem with that God. He knew this is the same God that appeared to the Israelites in the desert and he had no problem with that. He knew he had appeared before in the in in the form of pill of fire. But he also knew as a Bible scholar that when Moses met that same pillar of fire, he asked a question. Who are you? &gt;&gt; And the answer was I am who I am. So there was no answer given. So now Moses uh Paul he he knew that this is the same pit of fire that Moses made and therefore he asked the same question. And I want you to notice his words. He says who are you? He doesn't stop there. He continues, "My Lord." Hallelujah. He understood a scholar like him could not call anybody Lord. He knew Lord is the one who has control over your life. Lord is the one you worship. So he must have asked him in reverence. Who are you my Lord? And a voice came out of that pill of fire and he said, I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; I am Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. The Jesus of the New Testament, the Jehovah of the Old Testament. I am Jesus. But it doesn't stop there. He did not identify himself as only Jesus but he identified himself as Jesus in his church we are talking about today. The relation the restored relationship between man and God still on our series of our true origin. He says, "I am I am Jesus." &gt;&gt; He doesn't stop there. Now, now if you you're just a Bible reader without studying it, you'll just go through. But follow closely. He says, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? If you understand, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Did Paul ever meet Jesus physically? Did Paul ever persecute Jesus physically? No, he had not. Paul only met the disciples, people like Steven that he he commanded to be stoned. Stone him and many others. Saul met these people, persecuted them serious because they were following a man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; According to Paul, they were following a man. So he wanted to persecute themselves. But then he a voice speaks to him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he says, "I am Jesus." That was a shock. just for the voice out of the pit of fire to identify himself as Jesus. But as if that was not enough. Hallelujah. So the first phase of the revelation was that God of the Old Testament had incarnated in a man from Galilee called Jesus. It was the first phase of the revelation. And he came and he said, "Who do you say I am? What do you say I am?" And he said, "They call you, you know, so one of the prophets." But who do you say that I am? Are you following me now? And Peter by revelation said you are Jesus Christ the son of the living God. Now I want you to remember Jesus had answered had asked them this question and his question was specific. He said who do the do they say I the son of man are? [Music] a human being. Who do they say I am? And they said they say you are one of the prophets either Isaiah, Jeremiah or one of them just like any other prophet cuz you're a human being. So they say you are one of the prophets. Are you following me? Keep your thoughts together because God kept on using prophets. Don't miss this now. He kept on using prophets every generation. Moses, Elijah, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah. They were prophets born out from among us, but anointed by God to prophesy or speak on behalf of God. So the apostle said they think you are one of the prophets because you are speaking on behalf of God. But the other prophets they all when they were prophesying they said thus saith the Lord. and Peter by revelation were able to see and understand that Jesus never spoke that way. Yes, he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet because he never said the Lord. He said verily verily I say unto you. Hallelujah. So this is more than a pro. So Peter by revelation Jesus said who do they say I the son of man? But Peter by revelation he said you are not just a son of man. You are a son of God. Hallelujah. Did you get it? Because Peter answered and said you are Jesus Christ. son of a living. &gt;&gt; You cannot be a son of God without being God. Hallelujah. Amen. In other words, I was saying God in you are the embodiment of God on earth. Everything that God was powered in you and Jesus said flesh and blood revealed this but my father in heaven revelation. I will build my church of hell shall not prevail. The church of Jesus must come back into relationship with God by spiritual revelation of who God is. Thereby they will know who they are. Now here Jesus now is speaking with Paul before he became Paul and and the voice out of the pit of fire says I am Jesus you remember that revelation for the voice to call himself Jesus it meant he's God himself he had already given the revelation when he No, for there is one God and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus. Talking about the chasm, there was no one able There was no one worthy to bridge this. There had to be one. And now we read in Revelation 5 where I told him the lion of the tribe of Judah prevail. But see this is the same scripture here that says for there is one God and one mediator between God and man. Okay, before I continue on that, you look at Revelation 5 where he says, "The lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed." And when John turned to see, he did not see a lion. But he saw a lamb and this lamp was as slain before the foundation of the world. Then brother Bam said then out of that I can preach God in simplicity. You know God in simplicity. God hides himself in simplicity revealing himself in the sand. Praise the name of the Lord. Which simplicity? First Timothy 2 5. This is the simplicity of God. There is one God, one mediator, one man who could bring the chasm between God and he said who is it? Who is it? The man. Everybody say the man. The man Christ Jesus. Now here is not talking about his deity. God had to become man. And when he when he says God became man, it means God literally became you. He humbled himself. Yes. In the book of Philippians chapter 2, he he says, "Let this mind be in you as also it was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God did not rob to be equal with God. He humbled himself in a form of a because he was found in a fashion as a man, he humbled himself to the death of the cross. And yet he was God himself. And because he was formed as a human being, he humbled himself and he accepted to die. Can you imagine God dying in why did he do that? He died so that he can bring the chasm. All the redeemed of the Lord will now cross over. All of them would cross over. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where would they cross back to? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, brother, &gt;&gt; where were they crossing back to? Crossing back into the glory of God. The Bible said that all men have sinned and all have come short of the glory of God. My very last scripture says one 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations now it is made manifest not to everybody but to the saint hallelujah to the saint who is a saint saint is a blood washed redeemed amen forgiven saved child of It has been made manifest. There's a mystery which has been hidden. But now has been made manifest to his saints. to whom the saints God would make known that is the riches the riches riches glory meaning his glory so rich his glory is so richer than golder than money that's why he's of me in the fire without money without believing by accepting. Amen. The riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you. hope of glory. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This is the purpose of the opening of the seven. What I just told you right now is the reason why the message is different from all the other We have a mystery that is unveiled among us. May God open your spiritual mind to understand the things I'm talking about. Maybe you want to go back and listen to them. I'm sure many of you have missed a few things. Then he told John, "Don't be brokenhearted. Don't weep for the lion of the tribe of Judah. The offspring of David, he has prevailed. The lion and the root of David has prevailed has overcome." And on Sunday, we talked much about that. Amen. We talked about the root of David prevailing. and talk about overcoming. Are you following me now? Amen. So he fought and he overcame and he prevailed. Amen. So I don't have to fight. Hallelujah. In that sense, I don't have to overcome. In that sense, knowing that he fought and overcame he fought for who? Not for himself. I don't have to die in that sense. Why? Because he died for himself. He died for you. He overcame for you. He fought for you. He for you. He did not do all that as God did it as a human being. Do you understand that Jesus had his own will as a man? He didn't want to die. He feared the cross. He feared death to the extent. He actually went and prayed. He said, "Father, if it is possible, take away this." He realized the prayer was not answered. He said not according to my will according to your will. So there was the will of the father and there was the will of the son and the son's will was not to die. Why? Because he was a representation of you and me. Brother said, God struck him and when he was at the cross, he cried. He said, "My father, my father, have you forsaken me?" And he said, "God, turn the other side." He didn't look at him. Why? Remember that was you. And when we talk about the son, remember Jesus was both 100% God and 100% man. So here we talk about two different God. But as a son, he was a human being with his own will flesh and blooded with everything you are tempted with. Amen. He overcame never was overcome. That's why he is our savior. That's why he's our redeemer. He prevailed over sickness. He prevailed. the grave fear sickness every demon over the hell and the grave hell the grave power over him. That's why the Bible calls him the mighty conqueror. He conquered everything conquered everywhere. conquered mighty. Hallelujah. So you cannot depend on yourself. You have to know that there is one that you might attain all the victory. Hallelujah. He did everything for me. To remain a loser, not to remain a sinner, not to remain a poor man, remain a manful man, not to remain a fornicator, but he did everything for me. Amen. That I might all the victory he won for me. Hallelujah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He overcame as man. &gt;&gt; He prevailed as man. &gt;&gt; That's the simplicity of God. Amen. Prevail means rest and overcome. Amen. And brother Bam talks about the garden of Gethsemane when blood dropped down out of his face. [Music] He was overcoming. I'm so glad that you overcame. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now in Revelation 10, I just pray that we in this few minutes we we finish up this so next time we go on another. I not said 10. I said in a few minutes. Okay. Now, it says, "And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as the pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth. And now you know of course it says that when he had uttered his voice, seven thunders uttered their voices. And um and he was about to write and then the voice said, "Sal up those things and write them not." But then on verse seven he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. You see now I want you to see the importance of the seventh angel. This is the reason even why we call our church days of the voice fellowship in the days of the voice of the seventh. Remember the mysteries were sealed up. They were sealed up, right? And and and and John was not permitted to write it. These are the same mysteries. The same mystery which was also sealed up in the days of Daniel. He saw but then you know God spoke to him and said seal it up. But now here he says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, it shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished." Amen. So the mystery of God will not be finished until the sounding of the seventh angel. So you see the mysteries remain sealed. And when you talk about the mystery of God, yes, you are talking about the Godhead. And you know when you talk about the Godhead, follow me now closely. When you talk about the Godhead, you cannot you you are talking about the bride as well, the church. So by unveiling the mystery of the godhead, You are also unveiling the mystery of the bride. Let me put it this way. By unveiling who God is, you are also unveiling who the church, the true vine, the true church is and what she stands for. Because you see this reveals all the mysteries about praise God. &gt;&gt; So now here in the bridge, brother says the mystery of this seven sealed book will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh church angels message. The seventh angel begins to sound and there is the messages wrought out there and we got it on tape and book form. Listen church. The denominations cannot understand the mystery of God. They cannot. They cannot because that mystery of God will remain a mystery until the coming of the seventh angel's message. It is the message of the seventh angel which is the last day messenger, the last prophet to the Gentiles, the one also who will fulfill Malachi 4:5. that will actually you open the mystery. Follow me closely. His message is so important that without it the whole world will not have the mystery of God. And when I say the mystery of God, it doesn't mean they will have they will have a little revelation. But they will never truly understand like Jesus said in seeing they might see but they will not understand in in in revelation in revelation 3 he says that they they you know they are blind but they don't know it that they will take the word the Bible they will preach on one god God rather instead of teaching on one God, they will pick the trinity is what they see here. In saying they might see but they will not understand. They will preach water baptism into into the trinity infant baptisms. They will accept women preachers in their churches. They will not have church order in their churches. Why? They are blind and they don't know. So you can't tell them they are blind because they will tell you no we are not. And isn't this the condition of the denomination? They don't think they are blind. They think they are increased with goods and have need of nothing. They tell don't preach to us. Preach to others. They are blind but they don't know. You see great is the mystery of follow me closely for pray for me here now very important moment here for us. We need to understand which time we are living in what is happening here. We are not here to start another church. God is done with the business of churches starting. He's out of the churches. And when I say churches, I mean the denominations, you know them by name. And their entire mind was to building a denomination. We are here. We in in in this city that we that in that city and so we are big data and the government will respect them. They will have a voice and then a man on top will will be the one on the headquarters. God is done with God is out of the denomination. He vomited it out long time ago. But what is it doing now? It's your business calling his bride. Come out of the denomination to come up to a higher revelation, higher dimension to understand who God is. Thereby receiving a revelation of who you are and knowing for sure. You are going to walk into the reality of where you came from. You came from God. You go back. The seventh angel begins to sound. And there is a message wrought out. And we have it in books and tapes. So if you're not reading the books and if you're not listening to the text, can I say this now? Let us settle this here. You are not a message believer. You can believe it or you you may choose not to believe it. the truth. Just like I would say if you are not reading the Bible, you are not a Christian. This seventh angel messenger is not coming for everybody. Remember, it is not about him. He's only coming. Amen. with a book which is already open. He's sounding from an open book and he says we have it in books and tapes. So the message believers will feed on them. Revelation 8:10 uh 7:11 rather 8-11 he says take the book the open book and eat it up who John so if you are not eating the book you are not John now can all of us agree with that if you are not eating the book you are not John because the voice told John take out from the hand of the seven eat it up and prophesy again. So if you are not eating the book you are not John and a prophet said John is a type of the bride. Let us not waste our time with this with with you know a less important thing. It is good to listen to other preachers. It's all right to do it on occasion but I tell you friends have you listened to the message? Come to your home church. Listen to your pastor preaching. Go back home. Read your Bible and listen to the message. The problem with message believers, we love listening to our preachers and their interpretation of the message until wrong doctrines are crept in. I would have loved it better if I can preach something here and someone will come to me after church service. I tell you, pastor, you say it this way, but the messenger says it this way. And I will say, wow, I never will correct it. I would love it. Message believers believe the message of the hour. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now at the beginning of the sounding of the message, the mystery of God should be finished at that time. Now we will notice the book of the mystery of God is not revealed until the seventh angel's message is found. Can we all say amen to this? It is not revealed until the seventh angel's message is sounded white rider. a white horse right there going forth to right and everybody said oh that is Jesus conquering the whole world and they were like that along with that they believe the trinity three gods they believed in worship of Mary and other things but when the seventh angel messenger came That is not Jesus. That is Satan. That is Satan. Why is it Satan? He has a bow, but he has no arrow. What does it mean? He can't kill nobody. Hallelujah. By exposing Satan, he's revealing Jesus Christ. And by revealing Jesus Christ, he's revealing the bride, then you get to know who you are. Because whenever the the the enemy comes in like a fly, the spirit of God raises a standard. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Now, it is a book, a mysterious book. It is a book of redemption. And he says, "We'll get into it a little while." And now, this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood. It is progged in through the church ages. But at the end, when the seventh angel begins to sound his, he winds up all of those loose ends. and these fellows proved arts. Let me help you church. The things we preach in this message of the hour, we are not the first to preach them. The apostles were the first. The message has nothing new. That's the truth. And all the other denominations have a lot of truths. a lot of truth. By the way, all the things others preach before him, not only those in the Bible, but throughout the church ages. But you see the idea is none none preached the whole council of the word. You find one with this truth, one with preaching predestination but is wrong on the other other things. One here preaching on on eternal security but wrong on other things. One here preaching baptism in Jesus name but wrong on other. one year preaching no women preachers but wrong another. That's right. Did you know the Roman Catholic Church has a lot of truth? Did you know that the Roman Catholic Church preaches and believes they don't believe in polygamy? Did you know they don't believe in ordaining a woman priest? [Music] They have no woman bishop. So the next time somebody tells you, "Oh, you're a cult." But even other churches preaching, it's not the truth that has started with us. It's been here a long time. Others preach the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they wrong on everything else. But then the message of the hour brings and ties all the loose ends and summarizes the whole thing brings a full package to the bride. Nothing will perfect the bride, but a perfect word. And a perfect word will only be come by the seventh messenger, not a fifth, sixth. Seven is completion. God is trying to say I'm completing now my church summing it all up. doing a final work for the rapture. Now you see the things we are preaching, don't ever think it is exclusive to us only. You will go somewhere and you find them preaching it the way you you believe it. Not everything but one of the things they believe and then you will think ah they are reading brother Bham. No some of them are not but is that a truth they had but wrong on everything else throughout the church ages proved that this revelation they have probed they have like tried to get into it. But the the seventh angel messenger comes and winds up the whole world and it reveals the entire revelation of God. Then the God and everything else is settled. The Godhead and everything else is settled. All the mysteries, serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed. Oh my. I have no time listening to a preacher with half truth. [Applause] But I have all my time to listen to the message of the hour, the full final council of truth in our generation. Hallelujah. You find believers wasting time with tele evangelist. Oh brother, you don't know what you're you're believing in your name. Come to another dimension. And he says, I'm not just making that up. It is the book holds a mystery of the names of those supposed to be sealed. has the names of those people that will be saved. The book holds that mystery and the book is unfolding it now. Not each one's name, but what a mystery of the book is why is calling those names. You finally understand that now when you when the when the unfolding of the mystery happened, You hear your name being the book doesn't say leave [Music] Solomon. &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't say that the mystery. It unfolds the mystery of what? The thing is but we ourselves by faith we believe it. Okay. Now in a few moments let me try to summarize and I wanted to read for you 2 Corinthians 11 where Paul says would to God be ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me. For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy. I have exposed you to one husband that I may present you to as a chest virgin to Christ. But I fear that lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subility, so your mind should be corrupted from the from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted, he might well bear with him. Paul here is trying to define his job to estab his job was to establish the relationship between God and man to accomplish what Jesus came to do. Let me put it this way and this is the purpose of this message because Paul, brother Bham says I preached what Paul preached. The angel come revelation five, you know there is no one to bridge the chasm sin to redeem the fallen man but the line of the tribe of Judah prevail what what happens we see in revelation 10 revelation 5 he takes the book it's worth it open the mystery but in Revelation 10 is now coming down as a mighty angel in his right hand with a a little book of you see it doesn't go to every believer in every generation. What does it do? He says this book may God help you to see. Brother Bam now says throughout the ages the the the ministers the preachers have tried to probe into it. [Music] But the fullness of it, full revelation of it now comes only when the seventh angel messenger comes. Wait, the seventh angel messenger doesn't start the unfolding of the mystery. He finishes the unfolding of the but in the days of the voice of the seven when he begins to sound the mystery will be finished. And now in the days of the seventh angel messenger. He takes the open book and finishes the mystery. Ties all the loose ends to me. And what does he do by that? Then is an instruction by God to the bride to the seed in every generation. Take the book. Eat it up. Receive the word. Believe the word. accepted it in your proof that someone has the Holy Ghost in every age is by receiving the word of their day. What does it show that they are the seed of God? because they are on the other side of the chasm. They can only cross over by the shed blood. But this shed blood is in the form of the open word. Those who will accept it, those who will believe it, they will cross over. Where will they be going? They will be going back again to the image that they lost in the beginning. The mediator, the mediation work of Jesus Christ continues with the message of the hour. He did it on the cross. But then that alone cannot save you by saying I believe in what he did in the cross. But you stop there. Many have done that. And those are the ones we call Christians. But they are not going in the rapture. All of them. It's only those who truly receive the word in their day. the revealed open. So when they receive it, then the seed in them is quickened. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. My time is up. I just want to &gt;&gt; I wanted to finish this but I don't think I am going to. But we see that this relationship between God and man cannot be restored until the full word has been brought back. You see the believers. Let me begin with with the Jews. God is God is wonderful. He has ways he does things. the the Jews because you know because of unbelief he turned away from them and he blinded them and salvation goes to the Gentiles. What will happen to them? Those who were executed and killed and henchmen old Nazi Germany. These are the ones we see under the I think it is the fifth seal souls under the army. They are given white robes. They they are given grace because they would have received it but they did not because their eyes were blinded. [Music] And we see those in the days of of of of Luther, you know, they the bride, those who received Luther's message, but Luther smoked a pipe. He did. And his people did baptize in father, son, holy spirit. But to God that didn't matter. because it was not the time for the fullness of the revelation to come. But Peter, but Luther received the seed for that time, probed onto it shall live by faith. That's all the revelation God allowed them to see. And when they received it, It so quickened them that they received the Holy Ghost. What? What? Yes. For they received the portion of the Holy Ghost according to the revelation of the word they had in their name. Trity didn't matter to God is that the revelation which was powered out in their day. Hallelujah. They received it accepted it and then comes and then all the others. But now we are living in the final age. We have no excuse. We are the Omega bride. Everything is finished in our generation. Therefore, we cannot settle for less. We have to receive all the revelation all the world not a part of the world. Hallelujah. And brother Bham said this is the age I would have loved to live in. Oh friends, there are many things I can say and many things I want to say but we only cut short by time. I tell you friends this is more than a religion. is more than just speaking one one part of the message and running with it [Applause] and then you make a camp around it. We are coming into a place a time when the seed is ripening. Hallelujah. And the harvest is happening. Praise the Lord. It's a final work of redemption. It's a final season. We have to mature. The other seed will mature. The the tires will mature and manifest themselves and the seed will mature and manifest. I didn't finish up. God bless you. Just stand up on your feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, I'll tell you what the word is just so so wonderful. There's a lot that God wants us to get into. Only if we can. Amen. Only if we can. You see, there's nothing we can do to for the tires. Completely nothing. But also, there's nothing they can do to us. We can never bring them into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ. They can never destroy us. We've got the power. &gt;&gt; We've got the power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. Let us sing that tonight as the deacons prepare to bring the We got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power [Music] in the name of the Lord. Satan rages. Come on, brother.
