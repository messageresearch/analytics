[40:09] Bibles and this so-call children is
[40:12] Bibles but I don't believe in them I

[2:46:35] idols look at
[2:46:44] SRA
[2:46:46] [Music]
[2:46:49] and they were
[2:46:50] boys were young men there were
[2:46:57] youth the prophet
[2:47:01] says God cannot cannot miss to have a
[2:47:05] witness in the world yes he cannot fail
[2:47:08] to have a witness in the world praise
[2:47:10] God Amen now those
[2:47:13] men the the document came
[2:47:17] up and they said all of
[2:47:21] you you must bow to this image but what
[2:47:25] did they do what did they do ladies and
[2:47:29] gentlemen they said it is
[2:47:33] impossible they went and stood before
[2:47:35] the
[2:47:36] king and they told him
[2:47:39] Emperor we have heard the
[2:47:42] decree but we cannot do that
[2:47:47] we know you can destroy us we even see
[2:47:50] the
[2:47:52] fire Our
[2:47:54] God can save
[2:47:57] us even he doesn't save
[2:48:01] us does us we are ready to
[2:48:04] die we are ready to seal Our Testimony
[2:48:08] with
[2:48:10] blood rather die we' rather
[2:48:13] die to
[2:48:17] Idol be your
[2:48:20] decision you rather
[2:48:23] die to
[2:48:27] Idols to
[2:48:30] ID yes rather be killed you'd rather be
[2:48:36] killed and go to
[2:48:39] heaven that's a decision of a real
[2:48:43] believer who knows his position in
[2:48:47] Christ who know what he has
[2:48:50] believed who knows what he's
[2:48:58] following amen amen we know where we are
[2:49:03] going and we are
[2:49:06] sure
[2:49:09] anded he
[2:49:13] us amen

[2:49:24] boys you're not standing before an
[2:49:28] emperor you stand before and tell

[2:49:45] save us save
[2:49:47] us can save
[2:49:51] us still can leave us die

[2:50:02] situation a situation can become like
[2:50:06] that King that
[2:50:09] Emperor but you must not
[2:50:13] bow
[2:50:15] anything that fights
[2:50:18] God it is an
[2:50:21] image brother says even
[2:50:25] money can become an image a wife can be
[2:50:30] an image
[2:50:32] bus be an image
[2:50:37] meaning you must
[2:50:41] balance that God takes the first
[2:50:59] andom people seek other
[2:51:02] things but when you get other
[2:51:05] things before you get
[2:51:08] godom you cannot get the

[4:11:20] this
[4:11:22] church
[4:11:24] some almost a month I
[4:11:29] think and I have noticed a
[4:11:31] transformation going on slowly
[4:11:36] slowly
[4:11:37] and I think brother you also did speak
[4:11:41] to him the other
[4:11:44] day there is something
[4:11:49] that don't look at
[4:11:58] ha there is something that going to
[4:12:02] come I told I believe
[4:12:06] that I hope and I believe that this
[4:12:09] church can do
[4:12:12] that can receive young men and young
[4:12:17] lady how theyed or how
[4:12:22] they they will come
[4:12:24] in and the word of will transform
[4:12:28] them because somebody else was not
[4:12:31] transformed doesn't mean someone else
[4:12:33] will not
[4:12:36] be if all of them there will be someone
[4:12:39] that
[4:12:41] will
[4:12:42] come if all of them can't be transformed
[4:12:49] there and that somebody is
[4:12:52] me amen amen is
[4:12:57] you is brother Jo brother Jo hallelujah

[4:14:09] he go there we I always want to give him
[4:14:11] time you
[4:14:14] know so one of these days he came and
[4:14:17] said I always ask him what are your
[4:14:22] questions so then that day he said I
[4:14:25] have only one
[4:14:27] question

[4:15:33] scriptures and so uh we did share that
[4:15:37] and I will not go the
[4:15:40] details the day were talking about
[4:15:46] baptism remember remember the time we
[4:15:49] called his former
[4:15:53] Pastor I think heed in the name of Jesus
[4:16:05] Christ
[4:16:08] him and he asked
[4:16:10] him come up and us
[4:16:16] how
[4:16:21] here my name
[4:16:32] isly so we called him and he was like I
[4:16:36] B you in the name of the father Lord in
[4:16:39] the name of the of the Father Son and
[4:16:43] the Holy
[4:16:49] Spirit and
[4:16:51] actually scripture in Matthew yeah I
[4:16:54] think you know it so that's what
[4:16:59] matthew8 yeah that one so when we talked
[4:17:03] about when we talked about it with
[4:17:06] pastor pastor was like that's that's not
[4:17:09] what we were talking about and I today
[4:17:13] decided to do
[4:17:22] to to say thanks to the Lord because now
[4:17:25] I know the
[4:17:26] truth
[4:17:31] amen amen amen and uh he actually when
[4:17:35] we call his Pastor he said yeah in the
[4:17:37] name of Father Son and Holy Spirit and
[4:17:38] that's the only
[4:17:43] way and actually I said I think those
[4:17:46] are those things are the same so we were
[4:17:48] like sure these are titles and these are
[4:17:51] names
[4:18:00] so but as we had brother John
[4:18:04] preach in this church
[4:18:07] we don't only preach
[4:18:09] bapm
[4:18:13] not amen yes that is just element Bible
[4:18:19] truth the
[4:18:24] beginning leaving the
[4:18:34] foundation on perfection
[4:18:39] this message is
[4:18:42] perfection
[4:18:44] the for the
[4:18:46] Rapture amen amen so if there is another
[4:18:50] one maybe been baptized
[4:18:53] before but not in that
[4:18:56] name you have to
[4:18:59] Beed because what you did
[4:19:05] then was by dipping in
[4:19:08] water they just said
[4:19:12] father there is there is no difference
[4:19:15] between you and a
[4:19:18] Catholic because they all don't have the
[4:19:20] understanding of the
[4:19:23] name but there are people in this
[4:19:27] world who were the ones that wrote the
[4:19:30] book of
