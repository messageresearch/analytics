[34:40] Sanctify us, Father.
[34:42] Draw us nigh and closer to thee.
[34:45] Consecrate us for your service.
[34:49] This is a moment that we have
[34:50] surrendered to you.
[34:53] We are thankful to thee
[34:55] &gt;&gt; because you have brought us here today
[34:58] and therefore we pray. May we not go
[35:01] back the same Lord. May we have a
[35:04] spiritual touch
[35:07] by the hand of God,
[35:09] those that are here,
[35:11] those online,
[35:14] those that will listen after [singing]
[35:17] each one of them have a spac experience
[35:19] with you.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; [music]
[35:22] &gt;&gt; by the hearing of the word.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Come and change our situations.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Come and turn the tables around.
[35:30] Come and give us testimonies.
[35:33] Come and hope our unbelief.
[35:37] Give us confidence in all things, Lord.
[35:41] We see your goodness. Humble us before
[35:44] thee. Give us thy wisdom.
[35:47] Oh Lord Jesus, we invite you to come and
[35:51] go with every person here
[35:54] all through this service
[35:56] &gt;&gt; and after it. Dear God, may they never
[36:00] forget the experience
[36:03] that they are going to have. Let it be
[36:06] eternal.
[36:08] Oh father, I surrender to thee now
[36:13] fully, completely and entirely.
[36:16] Take over my tongue.
[36:19] Father,
[36:20] &gt;&gt; may I find favor before your children
[36:24] that they may believe the word
[36:27] and I pray the Lord Jesus Christ. May
[36:31] the glory and honor return back to you
[36:34] in and at the end of the service.
[36:38] I decrease that you may increase
[36:42] in Jesus [music] Christ name I pray.
[36:45] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[36:51] Amen. [music]
[36:52] Amen.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; May God richly bless you.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming to church.
[37:03] Amen.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; I think this is my
[37:08] second time being here on a Wednesday,
[37:14] but it is the first time to be in the
[37:16] service.
[37:20] The first one I came when the service is
[37:22] is done.
[37:26] The people are getting out.
[37:29] I greeted them. I got the blessing.
[37:34] This one I'm here because I got a sick
[37:36] leave
[37:42] and I got it today.
[37:46] After the checkup.
[37:49] The checkup showed I'm I'm not I have no
[37:52] fever,
[37:56] but I was not really going through I was
[38:00] I was going through a hard time.
[38:05] But uh daytime I was okay just very
[38:10] but from Saturday
[38:14] uh the night times
[38:17] not okay.
[38:20] That's why it's not good to be alone.
[38:23] [laughter]
[38:28] God said it's not good that a man should
[38:30] be alone.
[38:34] So I I said I'm I thought I'll be fine.
[38:38] It went on and
[38:42] I I couldn't even I didn't want to eat
[38:44] at all
[38:46] until I could feel the body is getting
[38:49] weak.
[38:53] I could force myself to eat just to give
[38:55] the body
[38:59] but no sickness.
[39:03] Then I woke up on Monday.
[39:06] I know Tuesday, yesterday,
[39:09] reached work.
[39:12] All of a sudden people are telling what
[39:13] happened to your face.
[39:17] I said what?
[39:19] Said you have not looked at yourself in
[39:20] the mirror
[39:22] this morning. I said not at all.
[39:27] said, "Uhhuh. No, I didn't say that.
[39:31] [laughter]
[39:31] I have it." Said,
[39:35] &gt;&gt; I said, "Not at all."
[39:39] He said, "You look at your face.
[39:43] I looked and things had just come up.
[39:49] I didn't know why. I took a risk.
[39:53] I went for try to treat myself in my own
[39:56] way.
[39:59] Yeah, but uh I'm I'm better.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; God bless you, dear pastor.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Glad to have you today.
[40:12] Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:15] God bless everyone of you.
[40:19] Amen. Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles.
[40:22] Luke 10.
[40:27] 38-42
[40:43] Now it came to pass as they went that he
[40:48] entered into a certain village, and a
[40:50] certain woman named Martha received him
[40:53] into her house. And she had a sister
[40:56] called Mary, which also sat at Jesus's
[40:59] feet, and he had his word. But Martha
[41:02] was cumbered about much serving, and
[41:05] came to him, and said, Lord, dust thou
[41:09] not care that my sister had left me to
[41:11] serve alone? Bid her therefore that she
[41:14] help me. And Jesus answered and said
[41:16] unto her, Ma, Martha, thou art careful
[41:19] and troubled about many things, but one
[41:22] thing is needful, and Mary has chosen
[41:25] that good part which shall not be taken
[41:27] away from her. Amen.
[41:48] for
[42:31] Amen. You may take your seats.
[42:36] Father in the name of Jesus Christ,
[42:41] put this word together.
[42:44] Speak to the hearts of your people.
[42:48] in Jesus name.
[42:50] Amen.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; I always desire to be whenever the the
[42:56] the doors are open
[43:00] and God knows my heart
[43:03] but sometimes not possible
[43:07] but one day it will be possible.
[43:11] I still believe
[43:13] God will do it for me.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Walking in your own choosing is my
[43:18] subject.
[43:26] Walking in your own choosing.
[43:31] Yes.
[43:34] The scripture says,
[43:36] "Now it came to pass
[43:39] as they went
[43:41] that he entered into a certain village
[43:45] and a certain woman named Martha
[43:48] received him into her house.
[43:52] As Jesus was passing by a certain
[43:54] village,
[43:56] the Bible says he entered into a certain
[43:59] village.
[44:02] When he entered that village, a certain
[44:05] woman named Martha received him into a
[44:10] house. When you get to hear THAT JESUS
[44:14] CHRIST HAS ENTERED somewhere
[44:17] or is he passing this way, he's passing
[44:20] that way OR IS HE PASSING YOUR WAY?
[44:24] Receive him.
[44:27] Don't let him pass by.
[44:30] Don't let HIM JUST GO BY.
[44:33] RECEIVE him into your heart.
[44:36] That is into your heart. The prophet
[44:39] says
[44:40] when Jesus, he says, WHEN HE'S IN YOUR
[44:43] HOME,
[44:45] then there is no trouble.
[44:48] But when he LEAVES YOUR HOME, WATCH OUT
[44:51] FOR TROUBLE.
[44:53] BETTER DO ANYTHING THAT WILL KEEP HIM
[44:56] AROUND.
[44:57] BETTER DO WHATEVER YOU CAN THAT WILL
[45:00] ATTRACT him
[45:02] to your house.
[45:05] So when mother heard that Jesus had
[45:08] entered her village,
[45:12] she received him
[45:14] into her house.
[45:17] You may not have a chance and
[45:18] opportunity like ma
[45:21] to receive him in your house in a
[45:23] corporal body.
[45:26] But you can receive him all the time.
[45:30] When the HOLY SPIRIT COME DOWN ON THE
[45:33] DAY of pentecost, he didn't go back.
[45:37] That's why the PROPHET SAYS THERE'S NO
[45:39] MORE SAYING THAT I'M WAITING AND IN THE
[45:42] in the in the in the upper room 30 days
[45:45] or 50 days, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE.
[45:50] HE ALREADY CAME. YOU CAN RECEIVE HIM
[45:53] NOW.
[45:56] So when you hear that Jesus is passing
[45:59] that way,
[46:01] receive him in your house and she had a
[46:05] sister called Mary
[46:08] which also sat at Jesus's feet
[46:12] and heard his words.
[46:16] SO THIS HOUSE BELONGED to Martha.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T MARY'S HOUSE.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; It was Martha's house.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; AND THE ONE WHO received Martha.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. The one who received Jesus
[46:32] was mother,
[46:34] not Mary.
[46:37] Listen carefully.
[46:40] But mother
[46:42] was encumbered about much serving
[46:48] since she was the host of the Lord.
[46:51] He had the responsibility
[46:54] to provide FOR THE GUEST
[46:57] BUT THIS WAS NOT A NOMINAL guest
[47:01] like Julius comes you know he's hungry
[47:06] get bread get down
[47:10] there was something different about
[47:11] Jesus
[47:14] the Bible say
[47:17] and he came and he came to him
[47:21] and he Say, Lord, dust thou not care
[47:26] that my sisters left me to serve alone,
[47:31] you have come with many people.
[47:34] You have come with many people.
[47:36] But Mary
[47:39] and this is my house after all. Even
[47:43] Mary is just CHOSEN TO SIT DOWN
[47:47] AT THE FEET OF JESUS
[47:49] to hear his word.
[47:51] AND MOTHER'S DOING ALL THE CHORES alone
[47:56] the house. HE SAYS BID HER there
[48:01] that she help me
[48:04] as if that didn't move Jesus.
[48:08] Jesus answered and said
[48:14] THOU ART CAREFUL AND TROUBLED ABOUT MANY
[48:16] THINGS.
[48:20] It's good to have a LOT OF THINGS TO
[48:22] CARE ABOUT.
[48:24] Don't let them TOO MANY.
[48:27] DON'T let them BE TOO MANY
[48:30] until they be they take you the time.
[48:34] They take the time. They occupy your
[48:36] time not to hear the word
[48:42] UNTIL THEY OCCUPY ALL YOUR TIME.
[48:46] Occupy all your mind.
[48:49] you know that she was trying to serve
[48:51] the Lord
[48:54] but that was THAT IS NOT THAT WAS NOT
[48:56] THE FIRST requirement at that time.
[49:02] It's like you just right now
[49:05] you we have come the service has started
[49:09] then you pick a towel
[49:11] you start cleaning
[49:15] is what you are doing is good
[49:18] but I'm you are confusing the preacher
[49:24] you start to look for toilet paper you
[49:26] taking them to the TOILET IT IS GOOD BUT
[49:29] YOU ARE DOING it at the wrong time.
[49:33] I forgot to give the PUMPER TO THE BABY
[49:36] SERVICE TIME. You would have did that
[49:40] because
[49:45] you don't know
[49:48] a point.
[49:50] It says M
[49:53] careful and troubled about many things,
[49:57] BUT ONE THING IS NEEDED.
[50:01] YOU LOOK AT JESUS WHAT HE SAYS. HE SAYS
[50:04] ONE THING
[50:06] IS NEEDFUL
[50:08] AND Mary
[50:10] has chosen
[50:14] not that I've told her.
[50:17] Mary has chosen
[50:21] that good part
[50:25] her own choosing
[50:29] which shall not be taken away from her.
[50:34] IT WAS A CHOICE THAT SHE MADE.
[50:38] YES, we have a lot to do AT HOME.
[50:41] BUT we need to have the whole family
[50:43] altar.
[50:45] Yes, I have a lot of things TO HANDLE.
[50:48] BUT I NEED TO PRAY. YES, I HAVE A LOT OF
[50:51] THINGS TO TALK ABOUT.
[50:53] But Jesus, I have to talk about him too.
[50:57] But I have to find a time alone with
[50:59] him.
[51:01] There is a lot of things that is
[51:03] necessary.
[51:05] A LOT OF THINGS THAT IS NEEDED.
[51:08] A LOT OF THINGS THAT'S THE RIGHT TO BE
[51:10] DONE.
[51:12] A lot of THINGS THAT'S YOUR OWN PERSONAL
[51:15] RESPONSIBILITY.
[51:18] Sometimes
[51:20] and sometimes
[51:22] almost time IT'S YOUR OWN GODGIVEN
[51:26] responsibility
[51:31] but
[51:33] it's a part of your personal walk with
[51:36] the god.
[51:39] It is different from your personal walk
[51:41] with the god.
[51:46] You may have a responsibility GIVEN TO
[51:48] YOU BY GOD,
[51:52] but it's a little bit different FROM THE
[51:54] FROM THE TIME YOUR TIME with God.
[51:58] IT'S A time you choose
[52:01] yourself.
[52:05] It's a walking with Jesus.
[52:08] It's a walking WITH GOD. IT'S A PERSONAL
[52:11] choice
[52:13] we make every day.
[52:19] Let me just have to say this.
[52:22] I love to talk to my fiance
[52:27] at times when I say I've not talked to
[52:29] her. She may talk she might call me at
[52:31] this time.
[52:35] But then I I say
[52:38] now but I want I want to pray at this
[52:40] time.
[52:43] And I'm like, but she might she might
[52:45] call me.
[52:49] If I don't pray,
[52:52] it may not go well.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; I if I lose the time for prayer,
[52:59] I will lose something about her.
[53:02] I may lose her call. I lose her call.
[53:07] But if I do pray, I'll gain more from
[53:10] her.
[53:13] So I choose to pray
[53:16] then I get her later.
[53:20] What am I trying to say? What you get
[53:22] through prayer?
[53:25] You can only keep it by prayer.
[53:31] The choosing of the bride. He says
[53:43] paragraph 31.
[53:48] In many things of life, we are given a
[53:50] choice.
[53:54] The way of life itself is a choice.
[54:01] We have a right to make our own way.
[54:06] Choose our own way that we want to live.
[54:12] You know it says in the time of
[54:14] decision.
[54:17] God doesn't make all your decision.
[54:24] If we have to wait upon God for every
[54:26] move,
[54:30] He says then there is no overcoming on
[54:32] our part.
[54:36] There are many TIMES A PROPHET SAYS GOD
[54:38] WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
[54:43] What would you have done
[54:45] if this was your daughter?
[54:48] God says I'm waiting on you to see what
[54:50] you will do.
[54:54] THERE ARE TIMES HE says
[54:57] God I'm waiting on you.
[55:03] God doesn't make all your decision.
[55:12] He says
[55:14] we have a right to make our own way,
[55:20] CHOOSE OUR OWN WAY THAT WE WANT TO LIVE.
[55:25] education is a choice.
[55:28] WE CAN CHOOSE WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO BE
[55:31] EDUCATED OR WHETHER WE ARE NOT going to
[55:33] be educated.
[55:37] THAT IS A CHOICE THAT WE HAVE.
[55:42] RIGHT. And wrong is a choice.
[55:46] Every man, every woman, boy and girl
[55:50] has to choose whether they are going to
[55:53] live right or not live right.
[55:57] It is a choice.
[56:00] Then he choice
[56:03] is a great thing.
[56:12] Choice is a great thing.
[56:18] your eternal destination
[56:23] is a choice.
[56:26] And maybe tonight,
[56:28] it's good. This message is also in the
[56:30] night.
[56:32] Some of you will make that choice.
[56:36] I passed by those fellows there at some
[56:39] denominational church.
[56:43] Today, this night, your evening, they
[56:44] were teaching children and so forth how
[56:46] to make choices.
[56:50] I felt glad. I said, "Oh, praise God."
[56:54] And we are going to talk about the
[56:55] reality of it. That's the darkness of
[56:57] it. That's not
[57:03] USING THE THEOLOGICAL PART of it.
[57:07] But, we are using the spiritual part of
[57:08] it.
[57:11] YOUR ETERNAL DESTINATION IS A CHOICE.
[57:16] YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE
[57:18] where you will spend eternity
[57:21] service ends.
[57:24] There will be one time
[57:26] that IF YOU TURN GOD DOWN many time.
[57:33] There will BE ONE TIME YOU TURN HIM
[57:35] DOWN. THE LAST time
[57:40] there is a line between mercy and
[57:42] judgment.
[57:47] There is a line between death and life.
[57:52] There is A LINE BETWEEN GRACE and
[57:54] judgment.
[57:57] There is A LINE BETWEEN SORROW AND
[57:59] HAPPINESS.
[58:02] There is a bridge.
[58:05] in every life.
[58:09] And it's a dangerous thing
[58:12] FOR A MAN OR WOMAN,
[58:15] BOY OR GIRL, TO STEP ACROSS THAT LINE.
[58:21] For there is NO RETURN
[58:24] WHEN YOU STEP ACROSS THAT.
[58:30] So tonight, it might be the time that
[58:33] many will make their decision
[58:37] where they will spend the endless
[58:39] eternity.
[58:45] There is another choice that we have in
[58:47] life.
[58:50] That's the life is companion.
[58:54] A young man or a young woman
[58:58] stepping out on life
[59:01] has been given a right to make a choice.
[59:06] The young man chooses
[59:08] the young woman HAS A RIGHT TO ACCEPT OR
[59:10] REJECT IT.
[59:13] Don't say vision sister don't reject.
[59:16] She has a right to reject it.
[59:20] regardless of what you saw, what you
[59:22] feel, what you think, what you believe.
[59:26] But it is STILL A CHOICE
[59:29] OF BOTH SIDES.
[59:32] Both man and woman, they have a right to
[59:34] choice.
[59:36] Also, you have a choice. A Christian,
[59:42] YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF THE CHURCH.
[59:47] That's your own given privilege.
[59:51] We still have it in Uganda, too.
[59:54] CHOOSE ANY CHURCH THAT YOU WANT TO
[59:56] BELONG TO.
[59:59] THAT'S A CHOICE.
[1:00:02] YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO ANY OF THEM. IF
[1:00:04] YOU DON'T WANT TO,
[1:00:08] no one will TAKE YOU TO PRISON,
[1:00:10] BUT you'll end in a prisons of hell.
[1:00:15] If you want to change from THE METHODIST
[1:00:17] TO THE BAPTIST
[1:00:20] or the Catholic to a Protestant
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; SO FORTH,
[1:00:26] THERE IS NOBODY can tell you or make you
[1:00:29] come to any certain church.
[1:00:33] That's our freedom.
[1:00:37] THAT'S WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS.
[1:00:42] EVERY MAN CAN CHOOSE FOR HIMSELF.
[1:00:47] Freedom of religion.
[1:00:50] That's a great thing.
[1:00:52] God, help us keep it as long as we can.
[1:00:59] You have [screaming] ALSO A CHOICE.
[1:01:02] WHEN YOU choose this church,
[1:01:07] you can choose whether
[1:01:10] in this church,
[1:01:13] WHETHER
[1:01:14] YOU WILL CHOOSE a church
[1:01:18] that will GUIDE YOU TO YOUR ETERNAL
[1:01:20] DESTINATION.
[1:01:23] You can choose a CHURCH
[1:01:26] THAT HAS A certain creed
[1:01:29] that you might think that creed
[1:01:33] is just what you want.
[1:01:37] Most of the decisions we make
[1:01:41] are based upon what we want.
[1:01:44] All the other church has their creator
[1:01:50] and then
[1:01:52] there is the word of God.
[1:01:57] He says no that that one you can choose
[1:01:59] the church you want to.
[1:02:02] feel a crit can make you better.
[1:02:06] He says IF YOU FEEL THAT CRITIC SAY YOU
[1:02:08] HAVE A FREEDOM TO DO THAT.
[1:02:13] THERE ARE NO CERTAIN WORDS WE WANT TO
[1:02:15] USE TO PERSUADE ANY MAN.
[1:02:21] But we want every MAN AND WOMAN
[1:02:25] to have a godgiven conviction.
[1:02:29] NO MATTER HOW HARD IT CAN GET TO THEM,
[1:02:34] we still want TO THEM TO MAKE A CHOICE.
[1:02:37] WHETHER WHEN IT GETS HARD, THEY WILL
[1:02:39] STILL COME
[1:02:42] OR they will it's still they still we
[1:02:45] want to still have that freedom.
[1:02:50] WE DON'T WANT TO DEPRIVE you of that
[1:02:55] because
[1:02:57] we want to see
[1:02:59] which decision you make.
[1:03:02] And then there is the word of God
[1:03:06] have choice of
[1:03:09] YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.
[1:03:15] He says [snorts] there is an unwritten
[1:03:18] law among US
[1:03:23] of choosing.
[1:03:29] I do not read
[1:03:32] where he was invited.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[1:03:41] At one time Martha invited him and Mary
[1:03:44] was Lazarus was dead. BUT AT THIS POINT,
[1:03:50] it wasn't said that they invited him,
[1:03:54] BUT HE JUST ENTERED INTO THAT village
[1:03:58] and they received him.
[1:04:02] But he didn't give them a choice.
[1:04:06] He didn't choose for them.
[1:04:09] Mother come
[1:04:11] get over here.
[1:04:14] There is an unwritten law among us
[1:04:19] of choosing.
[1:04:22] Listen my brother, MY SISTER. YOU JUST
[1:04:25] CAN'T STAND ON TWO GROUND.
[1:04:29] YOU HAVE GOT TO CHOOSE ONE FOR THE
[1:04:31] OTHER.
[1:04:34] LOOK, YOU COME TO A POINT WHERE YOU ARE
[1:04:36] IN A STRAIGHT
[1:04:39] HELD BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS.
[1:04:43] It may be for a just cause.
[1:04:46] You don't know WHICH WAY TO GO FOR THE
[1:04:48] LORD.
[1:04:50] LIKE PAUL in Philippians CHAPTER ONE,
[1:04:53] HE SAID, "I AM BETW TO
[1:04:58] go and be with the Lord ought to remain
[1:05:00] and preach the gospel.
[1:05:02] If I go and be with THE LORD, IT WORKS
[1:05:04] GOOD FOR ME.
[1:05:06] But if I remain I really s
[1:05:11] I don't know which way
[1:05:13] but you can be in between
[1:05:16] when you don't know
[1:05:20] whether to choose God or
[1:05:23] the devil
[1:05:26] YOU CAN'T CONTINUE HAVING TWO OPINIONS
[1:05:31] or being doubleminded
[1:05:34] when it comes to make a choice.
[1:05:39] is a decision.
[1:05:46] If you don't decide, still you have
[1:05:48] decided
[1:05:51] and that is the worst decision you will
[1:05:53] ever make.
[1:05:59] YOU CAN'T CONTINUE HAVING TWO opinion
[1:06:05] for a doubleminded person.
[1:06:09] In James 1:8
[1:06:11] IS unstable in all his ways.
[1:06:17] All of his ways.
[1:06:21] GET THE MAN IS SO DOUBLE MINDED.
[1:06:26] It will BE SO UNSTABLE IN all his ways.
[1:06:32] Yes, sister. He says a sister not long
[1:06:34] ago.
[1:06:36] She had two brothers wanted to marry her
[1:06:40] and she could not make a DECISION WHO TO
[1:06:42] MARRY TO GET married
[1:06:44] and they both left her. He says better
[1:06:47] not take it too long.
[1:06:51] THERE WILL BE A TIME WHERE YOU HAVE TO
[1:06:53] MAKE A DECISION.
[1:06:56] Elijah says in first Kings 18:21,
[1:07:03] how long will you hold between two
[1:07:05] opinions?
[1:07:08] If the Lord be God,
[1:07:10] follow him.
[1:07:12] BUT IF be God,
[1:07:15] follow him.
[1:07:19] He came to this age.
[1:07:22] You know the spirits don't die.
[1:07:27] They just change the master.
[1:07:31] WHEN HE CAME TO THE EDGE,
[1:07:33] HE SAID UNTO THE EDGE of
[1:07:37] it's held up in INDECISION
[1:07:41] NOT COLD AND WARM HOT
[1:07:48] CHOICE.
[1:07:51] That was the condition of
[1:07:55] IT SAYS BECAUSE THOU art
[1:07:59] not hot.
[1:08:00] not
[1:08:02] spit this way, this way.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; No, not making a choice.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; That was the trouble of the age.
[1:08:12] Take note, we are still living in the
[1:08:16] but we are called out of
[1:08:19] you know be living in this world
[1:08:25] but we are not of this world.
[1:08:28] We can OPERATE
[1:08:33] though not with physical eyes.
[1:08:39] Brother,
[1:08:43] THERE ARE A TIME WHEN YOU are held
[1:08:45] between such circumstances.
[1:08:50] In the book OF JORAH 3 SAYS 14, THERE
[1:08:53] ARE MULTITUDES [screaming]
[1:08:54] in the valley of decision.
[1:09:03] multitudes in the VALLEY OF DECISION. I
[1:09:06] WANT TO TAKE THAT SCRIPTURE IN THIS
[1:09:07] DIRECTION.
[1:09:10] THERE IS MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE HELD UP IN
[1:09:13] MAKING
[1:09:16] BROTHER. YOU SAY BROTHER I JUST CAN'T
[1:09:18] SEE IT. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THIS
[1:09:20] EVENING, YOU ARE HELD UP somewhere
[1:09:26] because God God will never bring a
[1:09:28] message
[1:09:30] if it is useless.
[1:09:33] You are HELD UP SOMEWHERE
[1:09:36] BUT YOU YOU HAVE GOD REQUIRES YOU TODAY
[1:09:39] to
[1:09:42] he says take a decision.
[1:09:49] I want to let me tell you something.
[1:10:01] It's not good
[1:10:05] not to make a decision.
[1:10:08] And it's not good to rush into choices.
[1:10:14] And it's not good
[1:10:16] TO TAKE TOO LONG.
[1:10:18] AND IT'S NOT good to be afraid to make a
[1:10:23] decision. LISTEN, YOU MIGHT TAKE ON
[1:10:26] SOMETHING
[1:10:28] that you can you you can make A DECISION
[1:10:32] AND TAKE ON SOMETHING that you can't
[1:10:35] shake out of.
[1:10:39] But be warned,
[1:10:42] you may NOT MAKE A DECISION
[1:10:45] OR REMAIN IN SOMETHING THAT YOU WON'T
[1:10:48] SHAKE out of.
[1:10:53] Listen now. He says
[1:10:58] if you have prayed
[1:11:01] before you MAKE THE DECISION AND YOU
[1:11:04] PRAY then you make a decision
[1:11:08] whether it's WRONG OR IT'S RIGHT IT WILL
[1:11:10] COME OUT RIGHT
[1:11:16] WHEN I PRAY AND I JUST SAID GOD I TOLD
[1:11:20] YOU THIS I PRAYED NOW I'VE MADE A
[1:11:22] DECISION
[1:11:26] NOW IT'S UP TO HIM. If it's right, it's
[1:11:29] right. He will bring it out right.
[1:11:34] GOD WANTS A MAN TO MAKE A DECISION
[1:11:37] REGARDLESS.
[1:11:40] THERE IS NO EXCUSE
[1:11:43] FOR NOT making a decision.
[1:11:45] A man might WAIT TOO LONG
[1:11:49] AFTER HE HAS RECEIVED THE CALL OF GOD.
[1:11:52] I WANT TO MAKE YOU TO TO assure you
[1:11:54] today.
[1:11:56] Just make your decision.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; It's not pride. It's not pride to feel
[1:12:03] the call of God.
[1:12:06] It's a call. You make a decision.
[1:12:09] YOU GET SOMETIMES IN A TIME
[1:12:14] IN A TIGHT PLACE.
[1:12:16] The prophet says, "Be sure you make the
[1:12:20] right decision.
[1:12:23] Put God in everything."
[1:12:27] Sometimes he says,
[1:12:29] "Then after I prayed,
[1:12:32] see which way,
[1:12:35] see which way
[1:12:37] your heart leads." Amen.
[1:12:44] I know the heart is over a wicked
[1:12:48] but
[1:12:52] NO IT'S BEEN SURRENDERED TO GOD.
[1:12:56] LISTEN BROTHER THOUGH WE ARE MEN AND
[1:12:58] HUMAN BEINGS.
[1:13:00] BUT SINCE WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF
[1:13:03] God
[1:13:05] we are LED BY THE SPIRIT.
[1:13:08] THE DECISIONS WE MAKE,
[1:13:11] GOD MAKES THEM ALL COME OUT.
[1:13:16] Doesn't matter which way.
[1:13:19] HE ALL GETS TO THAT FINAL GOAL.
[1:13:24] I have a friend in Jesus
[1:13:27] that takes care OF SOMETHING.
[1:13:30] THERE ARE TIMES when you are warned.
[1:13:33] When you are warned,
[1:13:35] don't make certain decisions.
[1:13:39] And God will warn you brother.
[1:13:42] God will warn your sister
[1:13:45] not to warn such to make certain
[1:13:47] decisions,
[1:13:49] certain choices.
[1:13:53] Don't silence that voice.
[1:13:57] Just ask God
[1:14:00] why. There's something in here,
[1:14:04] something within my heart
[1:14:06] and it is this and that.
[1:14:11] What difference does it make?
[1:14:15] If you keep anything and you say this
[1:14:17] one even I don't feel like telling it to
[1:14:19] God.
[1:14:24] He knows it already.
[1:14:27] ONE DAY STANDING IN THE PRESENCE of that
[1:14:31] being
[1:14:34] says the prophet.
[1:14:37] HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE of God.
[1:14:41] And God told him, "Go and tell them
[1:14:46] their thoughts are allowed in heaven
[1:14:50] than they are.
[1:14:57] Just all those thoughts,
[1:15:00] God says they are too loud
[1:15:04] than your own words. here today.
[1:15:13] You do your OWN CHOOSING,
[1:15:16] but God will always warn you
[1:15:20] of the choices that you are going to
[1:15:21] make.
[1:15:25] But because OF THE FREE MORAL AGES,
[1:15:29] you you you choose to do it anyhow.
[1:15:33] But when God has warned you ABOUT IT,
[1:15:37] YOU START DOING IT ANYHOW
[1:15:40] AND YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT IT IS WRONG.
[1:15:44] But you choose to do it,
[1:15:49] then you can't blame God
[1:15:54] because
[1:15:57] God respects your choice.
[1:16:04] Whether I reject his whether I reject
[1:16:06] his word,
[1:16:09] whether I reject him,
[1:16:12] he respects your choice. [snorts]
[1:16:16] God says my spirit
[1:16:20] shall not sit with man.
[1:16:26] He respects the choice you make
[1:16:30] WHETHER YOU ACCEPT HIS WORD.
[1:16:33] WHEN YOU ACCEPT HIM, YOU ACCEPT HIS
[1:16:36] WORD, he respects it.
[1:16:43] HE RESPECTS YOUR CHOICE,
[1:16:47] BUT WILL ALWAYS WARN YOU OF THE
[1:16:50] CONSEQUENCES of your choice.
[1:16:55] They told Samuel,
[1:16:59] "Give us a king
[1:17:03] like the rest of the king,
[1:17:07] the rest of the nation
[1:17:09] that we may be like the rest of them
[1:17:13] and say, "OH, BUT BUT GOD HAS BEEN YOUR
[1:17:15] KING all through."
[1:17:18] No, we need another leadership.
[1:17:21] WE NEED ANOTHER GUY.
[1:17:23] GOD HAS BEEN YOUR GUIDE AUTHOR.
[1:17:29] He says it's all right.
[1:17:31] It's not they have not rejected rejected
[1:17:33] you somewhere.
[1:17:36] They have rejected me.
[1:17:38] But go and tell them this is the manner
[1:17:42] of the king. They shall
[1:17:45] such and such and such and such and such
[1:17:48] and such and such.
[1:17:52] And he came and he told them
[1:17:56] when you ask for the king when you get
[1:17:58] the king this and this and that and that
[1:18:02] and that will happen.
[1:18:05] Nevertheless, we want a KING
[1:18:09] WHO SET THEIR MIND UPON SOMETHING.
[1:18:15] It's hard to turn there.
[1:18:20] But I want to say UNTO YOU, ALWAYS PUT
[1:18:23] AN ALLOWANCE IN YOUR HEART,
[1:18:26] AN allowance in your mind
[1:18:30] of collection.
[1:18:41] I don't know that the microphone was
[1:18:43] scared.
[1:18:47] She made a decision to give way.
[1:18:51] [laughter]
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; So what am I saying here?
[1:18:55] It's that uh
[1:18:59] they they they were making a wrong
[1:19:02] decision
[1:19:06] and God warned them of that decision,
[1:19:10] the consequences of it.
[1:19:12] But they still
[1:19:14] wanted the king.
[1:19:19] God respected their choosing.
[1:19:24] God is so respectful.
[1:19:28] He is so humble.
[1:19:33] [laughter]
[1:19:33] Job says,
[1:19:35] "God is so great,
[1:19:38] but he despises no man.
[1:19:44] I wonder for us we despise men
[1:19:50] and he says God despises
[1:19:54] myself I despise myself
[1:19:59] but he doesn't despise
[1:20:03] he respected their choice
[1:20:07] and again I want to say
[1:20:09] respect each other's choosing
[1:20:15] I remember one time
[1:20:18] now it may be a right choice
[1:20:23] and you want them to do something else.
[1:20:26] They may be your children you want them
[1:20:28] to study something. I I remember when I
[1:20:30] wanted to study, I I I went I chose a
[1:20:33] course
[1:20:36] in water engineering
[1:20:39] and I brought back that
[1:20:42] advert whatever paper,
[1:20:46] one of my guardians.
[1:20:49] Uh it was brother Michael
[1:20:53] and I gave him that.
[1:20:56] You know, I I was really so confused.
[1:20:59] I used to come to him. I tell him I'm
[1:21:01] going to do me theology.
[1:21:04] And he tells me, "Oh, wow. Fine."
[1:21:07] He he could respect him.
[1:21:10] I come back again. I tell her, "I think
[1:21:13] I do this."
[1:21:15] And says, "Oh, I'll fail."
[1:21:19] And I was like
[1:21:23] then I came to I told him I'm going to
[1:21:24] do auto
[1:21:28] and he looked at it and said
[1:21:30] why not civil engineering
[1:21:34] I said what is civil engineering
[1:21:38] because I didn't know I didn't want
[1:21:40] engineering
[1:21:42] I had not thought about
[1:21:45] he said all right you do what I
[1:21:49] I just respected my children.
[1:21:53] But I loved it. What am I SAYING?
[1:21:56] WHETHER PEOPLE ARE WRONG or right,
[1:22:00] respect their children.
[1:22:03] If they are wrong,
[1:22:06] they'll remember the words of God.
[1:22:09] If they are right, they'll rejoice at
[1:22:11] you.
[1:22:14] walking in your OWN CHOOSING.
[1:22:17] YOU JUST CAN'T LET SOMEONE MAKE A CHOICE
[1:22:19] FOR you
[1:22:21] because if something COMES UP, YOU WILL
[1:22:24] say
[1:22:26] they chose it for
[1:22:32] we don't want to choose for you.
[1:22:37] Fall into your things.
[1:22:41] Fall into your things alone. But make
[1:22:43] sure you make the right decision.
[1:22:47] Ask counsel and guidance
[1:22:51] that you may make the right decision.
[1:22:54] It says
[1:22:56] many time
[1:22:58] men and women.
[1:23:01] Hear God's word.
[1:23:03] Uh
[1:23:05] that's in paragraph 43.
[1:23:10] And see it vindicated and proven
[1:23:14] to be the truth. YET THEY DON'T WANT to
[1:23:18] hear it.
[1:23:26] I PRAY THEE,
[1:23:29] HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT JUST MAN.
[1:23:34] I SUFFERED MANY THINGS OF him in the
[1:23:36] tree.
[1:23:39] That's the wife of Pilate.
[1:23:43] I suffered many things of him in the
[1:23:45] tree.
[1:23:47] Have nothing to do with the Jesus of
[1:23:52] this man. This man thought
[1:23:57] that washing his hands
[1:24:01] can make him guiltless.
[1:24:05] Well, THAT MAKES NO MAN GUILTLESS.
[1:24:09] IT IS THE FAITH IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS,
[1:24:13] WASHING YOURSELF AND CLEANING YOURSELF
[1:24:15] AND MAKING SURE YOU are clean after
[1:24:17] committing SIN. IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU
[1:24:20] CLEAN.
[1:24:24] Just on Sunday
[1:24:26] I was just in my heart saying Lord
[1:24:29] oh just have mer upon your servant and I
[1:24:33] was just there waiting upon the tax on
[1:24:35] the road
[1:24:37] just having a selfexamination
[1:24:41] and you know I was just thinking about
[1:24:43] the Lord
[1:24:45] just
[1:24:47] praying within my heart
[1:24:50] but then I happened to look at This man
[1:24:53] these men who stand by the road there
[1:24:57] they eat sugar cane there those guys
[1:24:59] there
[1:25:01] they drop those things there
[1:25:04] then in the trench
[1:25:08] then after
[1:25:10] these men get a broom
[1:25:13] those same men
[1:25:16] they get a broom they start to sweep
[1:25:21] They sweep these things
[1:25:23] into the trench.
[1:25:26] Now
[1:25:28] I go. I looked. I said, "Lord, what do
[1:25:32] you want me to learn from this?"
[1:25:35] Then I thought, "Is this man doing any
[1:25:38] good?"
[1:25:41] I said, "No." Well, he's cleaning where
[1:25:44] he's standing,
[1:25:46] where he waits upon,
[1:25:49] but he's spoiling the trench.
[1:25:52] Then I thought, it's all right for you
[1:25:57] when you ask for forgiveness from the
[1:25:58] Lord
[1:26:01] after doing wrong,
[1:26:04] but there is a life you have spoiled.
[1:26:09] I thought, oh, that's true.
[1:26:13] There are many times the Lord can
[1:26:15] forgive you.
[1:26:18] You have been cleansed.
[1:26:21] He washes you. But there is someone.
[1:26:26] So you
[1:26:28] is still polluted.
[1:26:32] Their mind
[1:26:34] was polluted.
[1:26:39] I thought Yeah.
[1:26:41] We do that many times.
[1:26:48] Then I thought,
[1:26:51] don't be selfish
[1:26:55] with your salvation.
[1:26:59] I believe that was God telling you,
[1:27:02] don't be selfish
[1:27:04] with your salvation.
[1:27:06] You are caring too much about your soul.
[1:27:11] But you don't know
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; though you it's well now
[1:27:18] but someone saw you and thinks it's all
[1:27:20] right.
[1:27:25] He says
[1:27:32] I I'm sorry I've went off the notes but
[1:27:35] that's how God works.
[1:27:49] Many hear God's truth.
[1:27:52] They see it vindicated and
[1:27:55] but they don't WANT TO HEAR IT. Pilate
[1:27:58] refused
[1:28:00] and he say okay. He took the he thought
[1:28:04] now I'm free of the decision
[1:28:08] what she has told me I'm not going to
[1:28:11] choose
[1:28:14] I'm not going to make any decision
[1:28:16] that was the worst decision he MADE
[1:28:19] LET ME PASS ON THE DECISION TO THE
[1:28:21] CONGREGATION
[1:28:24] HE SAYS ALL RIGHT CHOOSE YOU BETWEEN
[1:28:28] Jesus
[1:28:32] myself. I'm not going to choose.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:28:39] It's It's the worst thing.
[1:28:43] OKAY.
[1:28:45] CHOOSE you
[1:28:50] and they chose Barabas
[1:28:54] and they reaped.
[1:28:58] But it was still a choice.
[1:29:01] God gave them to make.
[1:29:03] However vindicated, whatever it was,
[1:29:07] IT WAS A choice for the thieves on the
[1:29:10] cross,
[1:29:12] either to choose Christ
[1:29:14] or to choose to blasphe with the
[1:29:16] priests.
[1:29:19] But Jesus was vindicated.
[1:29:22] THERE IS SOME OTHER REASON.
[1:29:28] There is SOME OTHER CHOOSING.
[1:29:31] THAT THEY HAVE THAN TO FACE UP TO THE
[1:29:34] truth
[1:29:36] and facts.
[1:29:38] Therefore, their ears can be close to
[1:29:41] the gospel.
[1:29:45] They will never hear it again.
[1:29:48] I adise TO YOU. GOD SPEAKS TO your
[1:29:51] heart.
[1:29:53] You act right there,
[1:29:58] brother.
[1:30:01] It is still a choice.
[1:30:05] There will come no day.
[1:30:08] There will come no time, not no moment
[1:30:12] that God will take that liberty away
[1:30:14] from you.
[1:30:18] He will keep it that way.
[1:30:23] Remember brother, sister,
[1:30:29] your choice,
[1:30:31] the prophet teaches us
[1:30:34] will reflect your ambition
[1:30:38] and your character. So it is not for us
[1:30:42] to ask
[1:30:44] I wonder what is Julius's ambition.
[1:30:52] Just watch.
[1:30:58] PASTOR PREACHED TO US A MESSAGE
[1:31:01] THAT THE word
[1:31:05] matures the seed.
[1:31:09] I didn't I had never thought about that
[1:31:11] all my life
[1:31:14] that the word matures the weed and the
[1:31:17] tears the seed and the tears.
[1:31:18] Hallelujah.
[1:31:22] I saw THIS IS THE TRUTH OF IT.
[1:31:25] NOW LISTEN BROTHER, IT'S YOUR CHOICE
[1:31:28] WILL AFFECT YOUR MISSION AND YOUR
[1:31:29] CHARACTER.
[1:31:31] What you choose
[1:31:34] shows what truly is in you.
[1:31:37] NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
[1:31:40] ON THIS SIDE.
[1:31:42] YOUR CHOICES SHOWS WHICH SIDE YOU ARE.
[1:31:46] I AM MADE OF THIS.
[1:31:49] YOUR CHOICES SHOWS WHAT TRULY YOU ARE
[1:31:51] MADE.
[1:31:54] IT'S easier for you to know that you
[1:31:56] don't have the Holy Spirit.
[1:32:01] It's easy FOR YOU TO KNOW
[1:32:04] THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. Your
[1:32:07] choices will speak to you.
[1:32:11] The things that you thirst for
[1:32:15] are the things that you will choose.
[1:32:19] As a matter of fact,
[1:32:25] thirsting and hungering after
[1:32:27] righteousness
[1:32:31] is the greatest gift to the believers.
[1:32:37] The kind of music that you choose to
[1:32:39] listen to,
[1:32:42] THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT YOU CHOOSE TO
[1:32:44] GET ALONG WITH,
[1:32:47] the places YOU GO TO,
[1:32:50] WHAT YOU DRESS AND WHAT YOU LOOK at
[1:32:54] shows exactly who you are.
[1:33:00] It's a choice you have in this age.
[1:33:04] When I get my phone,
[1:33:07] I have a choice
[1:33:09] what to look at on my YouTube.
[1:33:13] I have a choice
[1:33:15] which application to open at.
[1:33:19] I have a choice.
[1:33:29] Your choice reflects what is in your
[1:33:31] mind.
[1:33:34] And what your future is going TO BE,
[1:33:36] YOUR ENTIRE life is going to DEPEND ON
[1:33:40] THE CHOICES THAT YOU ARE MAKING.
[1:33:48] You look at these politicians,
[1:33:53] you look at what these men were
[1:33:56] and what they are trying to achieve.
[1:34:00] You see that they made a choice
[1:34:04] and they entered into the spirit of
[1:34:06] death
[1:34:09] until the man cares not whether he dies
[1:34:11] or not.
[1:34:15] I listen at young men at work. I look at
[1:34:19] fellow people friends there
[1:34:22] and I see when they enter the spirit
[1:34:26] they enter the spirit of it
[1:34:32] and it IT'S IT'S A CHOICE they made
[1:34:36] and it is just driving them whichever
[1:34:45] they do not care whatever whether they
[1:34:48] die.
[1:34:51] Someone is just so willing.
[1:34:54] I'm glad that someone can make a choice
[1:34:58] to live for Christ
[1:35:00] to pledge allegiance to the Lord.
[1:35:03] AND THEY SAID, "COME WHAT?
[1:35:07] I'll carry the cross."
[1:35:11] Before you can choose over anything,
[1:35:15] it's good to plan.
[1:35:18] It's good to look.
[1:35:20] IT'S GOOD TO PRAY.
[1:35:23] WE FIND THAT IF YOU did pray
[1:35:27] and you make a wrong choice,
[1:35:30] God will deliver you somehow.
[1:35:34] When you get to making a choice,
[1:35:37] don't choose depending upon the sight of
[1:35:39] beauty.
[1:35:42] magnific
[1:35:52] marriage.
[1:35:54] I'm not trying to talk about marriage.
[1:35:58] Because now you may be even already
[1:36:00] married.
[1:36:02] Now take it somewhere else.
[1:36:06] Don't choose according to beauty.
[1:36:10] It may BE A CHURCH. DON'T CHOOSE FRIENDS
[1:36:13] ACCORDING TO THEIR MAGN RICHES
[1:36:15] whatsoever
[1:36:17] shining.
[1:36:20] SOMETIMES
[1:36:21] YOU GOT TO CHOOSE THE HARDER WAY.
[1:36:27] I want to end with that quotation.
[1:36:30] Straight is the gate.
[1:36:44] Uh, paragraph 57.
[1:36:58] The prophet says
[1:37:10] none of us wants to choose a harder way.
[1:37:18] We don't want that.
[1:37:20] We also don't want it.
[1:37:23] But sometimes you have to CHOOSE THE
[1:37:24] HARDER.
[1:37:28] YOU SEE GOD TOLD THE Lord
[1:37:31] run as far as the mountain.
[1:37:35] He said, "Let me go to this."
[1:37:40] But what happened now?
[1:37:44] His daughters raped him.
[1:37:47] If you had run where God told
[1:37:51] sometimes you have got to choose the
[1:37:53] hard
[1:37:56] when God gives you what to choose
[1:38:01] and when he gives you what to choose
[1:38:04] he has helped you so much just take that
[1:38:07] WAY YOU SEE WHEN ABRAHAM WAS SITTING
[1:38:10] UNDER HIS TENT
[1:38:13] BECAUSE HE HAD MADE A CHOICE AND THAT
[1:38:16] CHOICE VOICE IS BROUGHT BEFORE EVERY
[1:38:17] PERSON
[1:38:19] THAT'S KNOWN IN this world. The tree of
[1:38:22] good and evil
[1:38:24] is set before every person.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] It says
[1:38:42] Lord didn't think that he was going No,
[1:38:44] no, no. Sorry. Uh
[1:38:49] and when uh yeah, Lot didn't think that
[1:38:53] he was going to backslide,
[1:38:55] but when he WENT TO LOOK TOWARD Sodom
[1:38:59] where things were easy,
[1:39:01] there's many times we LOOK TOWARD THE
[1:39:03] EASY WAY AND YOU join this certain
[1:39:06] certain church
[1:39:08] and you see nobody will say anything
[1:39:09] against it
[1:39:11] because is the biggest church in the
[1:39:13] city. is the way. Many times we do that
[1:39:18] when we are wrong.
[1:39:28] Time is first spent.
[1:39:31] Let me skip
[1:39:34] and conclude.
[1:39:37] Let me leave that quotation.
[1:39:40] Let me conclude with this standing in
[1:39:42] the gap.
[1:39:44] Let me leave that one.
[1:39:50] Yes, I have some.
[1:39:56] Is it all right?
[1:40:00] Amen. Amen. Paragraph 131 there.
[1:40:07] This is the
[1:40:09] the best I wanted to read.
[1:40:12] [clears throat]
[1:40:14] I was preaching in Los Angeles at the
[1:40:16] businessman's breakfast
[1:40:18] something they just laying down on those
[1:40:20] organizations
[1:40:22] there set the headman of the assemblies
[1:40:24] and many of the great dignitaries
[1:40:28] there and when I got through speaking
[1:40:31] and started to leave the platform
[1:40:35] getting ready the message was being sent
[1:40:37] out across
[1:40:39] the nation on radio and had to change
[1:40:42] back during this CHANGE WHEN THEY CUT
[1:40:45] off the radio
[1:40:47] to send that message out come back
[1:40:50] announced the station and I was at
[1:40:53] Clifton is where they have the breakfast
[1:40:57] as I I was working from the upper
[1:41:00] platform to the lower
[1:41:02] finally some looking younger fellow of
[1:41:04] about 30 years old
[1:41:08] forth and threw his arms around me he
[1:41:13] I am Danny Henry
[1:41:15] Henry
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; and not knowing what that is brother
[1:41:19] doing that tele televising know his
[1:41:22] brother brother
[1:41:24] was didn't want this look for words he
[1:41:28] just uses the nearest term
[1:41:32] and not KNOWING THAT WHAT HIS BROTHER
[1:41:34] DOING THE televising
[1:41:37] and it it terrifies Jesus
[1:41:44] for the Christian businessmen
[1:41:49] Russell
[1:41:50] Russell movie star
[1:41:53] in her mother is a Pentecostal preacher.
[1:41:58] I guess you understand what he's saying.
[1:42:00] Then when he started running to me,
[1:42:03] so he says when the young man money came
[1:42:06] and he ran to him,
[1:42:08] He throw his arms around me
[1:42:11] and he said, "God bless you, brother."
[1:42:15] He said,
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; "I hope this doesn't don't sound that
[1:42:19] religious,
[1:42:21] but to my way of seeing it,
[1:42:25] that message could be the 23rd chapter
[1:42:31] of Revelation."
[1:42:33] And when he said that,
[1:42:35] he started speaking in tong.
[1:42:39] A boy who had never even heard of such a
[1:42:42] thing.
[1:42:44] The Baptist by denomination,
[1:42:47] you know.
[1:42:51] God wants to do something
[1:42:54] that even the critics
[1:42:58] won't have enough evidence
[1:43:01] to criticize.
[1:43:05] AS SOON AS HE TURNED white
[1:43:08] and he looked at me, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
[1:43:10] TO DO. There is many sitting here. Was
[1:43:14] there
[1:43:19] was many who are there.
[1:43:21] He didn't know what to say.
[1:43:24] There was a GREAT BIG FRENCH WOMAN
[1:43:26] SITTING down here.
[1:43:28] She raised up. She said why that don't
[1:43:34] need any interpretation
[1:43:37] that was purely French.
[1:43:39] The boy said I don't know one word of
[1:43:43] friends
[1:43:48] and SHE HAD WROTE DOWN WHAT HE SAID.
[1:43:55] Look brother,
[1:43:57] there is no mystery that God can't have
[1:44:00] an interpreter.
[1:44:04] And then there WAS A MAN SITTING ON THE
[1:44:06] CORNER. He say
[1:44:08] that's correct.
[1:44:11] Two witnesses.
[1:44:14] I HAVE GOT WROTE DOWN WHAT HE SAID IS
[1:44:17] French
[1:44:19] in the back.
[1:44:22] He was the interpreter for the UN.
[1:44:26] And they compared the notes
[1:44:29] and this man over here was a victory
[1:44:34] of anic church out there.
[1:44:37] He wrote IT DOWN AND I'VE GOT THE
[1:44:39] INTERPRETATION to
[1:44:41] listen to this if I can read it.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; I Victor Lee is Victor.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; I'm a fully bloodlooded Frenchman.
[1:44:56] Born again Christian
[1:45:02] filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:06] WHAT A CONFIDENCE.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; MY ADDRESS is 809
[1:45:11] North Kings Road, Los Angeles 46.89
[1:45:16] Los Angeles.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; THIS IS A TRUE WITNESS.
[1:45:21] If you are witnessing give us your full
[1:45:24] testimony,
[1:45:26] DON'T BE A COWARD AFRAID. GIVE US THE
[1:45:29] FULL DETAIL, your testimony.
[1:45:32] I'm a Christian.
[1:45:34] I have the Holy Spirit. I RECEIVED HIM
[1:45:37] IN SUCH and such time.
[1:45:40] I attended the Beth Temple.
[1:45:44] Pastor Annie Vic,
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; a true translation that I proclaim of
[1:45:49] the prophecy said over brother
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; given by Danny Henry
[1:45:59] Henry in French February the 11
[1:46:05] 1961
[1:46:06] at the full gospel businessman's
[1:46:09] breakfast
[1:46:12] translation of the prophets
[1:46:15] Now here is what it is saying.
[1:46:20] Maybe you have never taken time to read
[1:46:22] it that way.
[1:46:25] That way that way. Such such a way.
[1:46:32] Now let us hear it that way.
[1:46:36] Because thou hast chosen
[1:46:47] because you
[1:46:50] have chosen well on the day,
[1:46:56] the narrow way,
[1:46:59] the harder way.
[1:47:01] THOU HAST WALKED IN YOUR own choosing.
[1:47:09] You have walked in your own choosing.
[1:47:16] I can see that with Moses.
[1:47:20] He had to make his choice. [snorts]
[1:47:23] THOU HAS PICKED THE PRECISE and correct
[1:47:27] way.
[1:47:33] correct decision
[1:47:36] and it is my way.
[1:47:43] I don't know how did he make this way.
[1:47:46] How did he make this choice?
[1:47:50] He compared
[1:47:52] it with
[1:48:00] underlined my way.
[1:48:04] Underlined my way.
[1:48:09] The Holy Spirit is speaking BACK
[1:48:13] BECAUSE of this momentous decision.
[1:48:18] A HUGE PORTION OF heaven
[1:48:22] awaits you.
[1:48:27] I wish you can take that to yourself.
[1:48:31] A huge portion of heaven
[1:48:35] awaits you.
[1:48:38] How that you WILL REACH IN GLORY AND
[1:48:40] PEOPLE is awaiting you.
[1:48:44] What a glorious decision.
[1:48:49] Thou hast made
[1:48:53] God is praising
[1:48:56] the decision of a man.
[1:49:00] Oh hallelujah.
[1:49:07] This in itself
[1:49:10] is that which will make
[1:49:14] and come to pass.
[1:49:17] the tremendous victory
[1:49:20] in the love divine.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; The choice of a man
[1:49:32] pleased God in such a
[1:49:35] God
[1:49:38] and embraced it and within
[1:49:42] testified of it and he said, "Oh,
[1:49:46] This is my way.
[1:49:51] Do you think it is hard for you to make
[1:49:53] such a decision?
[1:49:56] No, it's not hard. Just be drunk in the
[1:49:59] spirit.
[1:50:01] Wait upon God. Be certain of God,
[1:50:06] trusting in the Lord and have the
[1:50:09] confidence
[1:50:10] that you are son and daughter.
[1:50:18] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:50:25] Hallelujah.
[1:50:27] Shall we rise upon our feet?
[1:50:38] It's a decision that each one of us has
[1:50:40] to make.
[1:50:44] I just want to sing a song as our pastor
[1:50:46] comes as you think on these things.
[1:50:54] Amen.
[1:50:58] Grace
[1:51:01] I see.
[1:51:24] I want
[1:51:54] See friends,
[1:51:56] it's your choice. I think um what we
[1:51:59] have heard today is
[1:52:02] one [music] of the most important things
[1:52:04] in in our Christian faith.
[1:52:07] [music]
[1:52:09] Your choice will reflect your ambition.
[1:52:13] It will reflect your character.
[1:52:17] You know you can make many choices in
[1:52:19] life.
[1:52:21] You can make a choice to be educated or
[1:52:24] not.
[1:52:26] You can [music] make a choice when some
[1:52:28] of you students when you go to school.
[1:52:32] You can make a choice to have a good
[1:52:34] [music] grade
[1:52:36] or or not to. It's a choice.
[1:52:41] You can make a choice to find a job.
[1:52:44] If you don't have a job, you don't have
[1:52:45] an income.
[1:52:47] You [music] can be you can decide to
[1:52:48] just be coming to church and you have no
[1:52:50] job.
[1:52:53] Or you can actually make a choice to
[1:52:54] find [music] a job.
[1:52:57] You can make a choice to work or to be
[1:52:59] lazy.
[1:53:02] You can make a choice to pray or not to.
[1:53:05] You can make a choice. You [music] have
[1:53:06] to make a choice to over home church.
[1:53:10] You can make a choice to believe the
[1:53:12] word or not to.
[1:53:14] And you see each of us makes a choice.
[1:53:17] And it's an unconscious
[1:53:20] ability that we all have.
[1:53:26] We make a choice and we as believers
[1:53:29] should actually learn to respect each
[1:53:32] other's choices.
[1:53:36] Maven's choices might not be mine.
[1:53:40] I cannot enforce him to choose as I
[1:53:43] would choose.
[1:53:47] You understand that
[1:53:49] if someone has made a choice about their
[1:53:51] life,
[1:53:53] learn to respect them if they have made
[1:53:56] a wrong one,
[1:53:59] pray for them.
[1:54:01] But respect their choices.
[1:54:04] You know that is one [music] important
[1:54:07] thing really
[1:54:09] because as many times you find in many
[1:54:12] things in life
[1:54:15] people cannot respect others choices
[1:54:20] you know you find that everyone is
[1:54:22] forcing someone else to take [music]
[1:54:23] their choice
[1:54:28] but I want you to know each of us has a
[1:54:32] choice to
[1:54:34] And when you make your choice,
[1:54:37] there are consequences
[1:54:40] connected to that choice.
[1:54:42] And you are responsible.
[1:54:46] You are accountable
[1:54:48] because the choice was made by you. So
[1:54:51] listen, never be forced
[1:54:54] [music] to make a choice. Make your own
[1:54:57] choice. Always walk in the way of your
[1:55:00] own choosing.
[1:55:02] But as a Christian, as a child of God,
[1:55:05] I will encourage you to always be sure
[1:55:07] you in the will of God.
[1:55:11] And I will I will show you as we the
[1:55:13] preacher was preaching many times.
[1:55:16] The will of God is what we as human
[1:55:19] beings call the harder [music] way.
[1:55:28] And you know he
[1:55:31] he rehearsed the story [music] of uh
[1:55:35] of Lord.
[1:55:39] Come to think of it. Come to think of it
[1:55:42] just before we leave
[1:55:45] that God because of Abraham remembered
[1:55:47] Lot
[1:55:50] and he went to save Lot in Sodom.
[1:55:54] through the two angels.
[1:55:57] But when they arrived, and I'm going to
[1:55:58] read for you. I want you to listen to
[1:56:00] these words. And it came to pass when
[1:56:03] they had brought them forth abroad. Now,
[1:56:05] the angels had brought the family of Lot
[1:56:06] and Lot outside of the city
[1:56:11] that he said, "Escape for thy life.
[1:56:16] Look not behind thee, neither thou in
[1:56:19] all the plain."
[1:56:22] Listen. Listen. Escape to the mountain,
[1:56:25] lest thou be consumed. Now the words
[1:56:27] from the mouth of the angel were saying,
[1:56:30] "Escape to the mountain. Tell your
[1:56:32] neighbor, escape to the mountain,
[1:56:36] lest thou be consumed." But you see, the
[1:56:38] will of God was that they escaped to the
[1:56:42] mountain.
[1:56:43] But Lord said unto them, "Oh no, not so,
[1:56:46] not so, my lord, not so. Behold, now thy
[1:56:52] servant has found grace in thy sight,
[1:56:56] and thou has magnified thy mercy,
[1:56:59] which thou has showed unto me in saving
[1:57:01] my life,
[1:57:03] and I cannot escape to the mountain,
[1:57:08] lest some evil take me, and I die.
[1:57:12] Listen friends, if the will of God leads
[1:57:15] you into any direction,
[1:57:20] take the choice without a question.
[1:57:23] Because the will of God cannot bring you
[1:57:24] to a place where his grace will not take
[1:57:26] care.
[1:57:30] We all ought to say amen to that. Why?
[1:57:33] Because God, Amen, watches over those
[1:57:36] that he has chosen.
[1:57:39] But you see this man thought he knew
[1:57:42] better than God.
[1:57:44] He said, "I can't go to the mountain. If
[1:57:46] I go to the mountain, I may die there.
[1:57:49] Something bad may happen. Whatever the
[1:57:51] word of God says, brothers and sisters,
[1:57:54] don't question it. Don't doubt it. Just
[1:57:56] believe it."
[1:57:59] And and he said, "Oh, and behold, now
[1:58:02] this city is near
[1:58:06] to to flee [clears throat] unto
[1:58:08] And it's a little one.
[1:58:11] It's not as big as where I have been.
[1:58:15] It's not as big as
[1:58:19] this one is city.
[1:58:21] Oh, let me escape.
[1:58:24] Is it not a little one
[1:58:27] and my soul shall live? This man always
[1:58:30] loved was obsessed with cities, good
[1:58:31] things, big things.
[1:58:37] brother, if you love good things, it's
[1:58:39] not bad,
[1:58:41] but be sure it is part of God's word.
[1:58:44] And he said unto him,
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; "Okay, I've accepted you. Go, go, go,
[1:58:47] go."
[1:58:49] And he went there. But here is what I
[1:58:51] wanted to show you.
[1:58:54] This city was later called because he
[1:58:57] had gone there it was called
[1:58:58] insignificant
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; insignificant.
[1:59:07] So God now told him you can go
[1:59:11] but the place where he went to was
[1:59:13] insignificant.
[1:59:15] The permissive will of God usually will
[1:59:18] bring you to an insignificant.
[1:59:27] And later on of course we know that he
[1:59:29] actually when he went to this place he
[1:59:30] even feared later on to even live in
[1:59:33] that place. Exactly.
[1:59:37] He end up living in a mountain in a
[1:59:39] cave.
[1:59:42] The will of God never bring you to a
[1:59:44] place where his grace will not sustain
[1:59:48] you. Hallelujah. The will of God is the
[1:59:51] word of God. The will of God is the word
[1:59:54] from the mouth of the angel. The will of
[1:59:56] God is the word which never fails.
[2:00:01] Praise the name of the Lord. And so
[2:00:03] let's always walk in the will of God.
[2:00:05] Make our choices [music]
[2:00:07] according to the word.
[2:00:10] Amen. Let us sing a song that says, I
[2:00:13] don't want nothing here to hinder me as
[2:00:14] we give our offerings. Amen.
[2:00:22] Praise God.
[2:00:31] Trying to find
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; You got the words, brother.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't It's an old song we
[2:00:46] used to sing many many years ago.
[2:00:51] [music]
[2:00:58] I hope brother
[2:01:00] brother Noble you know the song
[2:01:03] nothing here to hinder me
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; for someday
[2:01:11] there's a crown
[2:01:14] one day I heard a voice
[2:01:17] he said if you will make me your choice
[2:01:20] I'll drive away your every care
[2:01:25] you free. So I came to him that day and
[2:01:29] he took my sin away. Now I don't want
[2:01:32] nothing here to be.
[2:01:35] One day I heard a voice
[2:01:40] saying, [singing] "If you make your
[2:01:43] choice, I'll drive away your every care
[2:01:49] and set you free." [singing]
[2:01:54] So [music] I came [singing] to him that
[2:01:57] day
[2:01:58] and he took my [music] sin away. Now I
[2:02:04] don't want
[2:02:06] nothing here or to [singing and music]
[2:02:08] hinder me.
[2:02:11] I don't want
[2:02:13] I [music] don't want [singing]

[2:02:58] [singing] often [music] times I do

[2:03:07] is [singing] filled with grief and pain.
[2:03:14] But if on me I can stand true.
[2:03:19] I know [music and singing] that he will
[2:03:22] see me through.
[2:03:24] I don't want
[2:03:28] nothing here [singing]
[2:03:30] to hinder me. [music]
[2:03:33] Sing with me now. Oh, I don't [singing]
[2:03:36] want
[2:03:38] nothing [music] here. Oh, you in the m.

[2:03:58] difference. [music]

[2:04:06] is my [music] cross. Oh, I don't want

[2:10:04] [music]
[2:10:07] [singing]
[2:10:08] the
[2:10:09] Amen.
[2:10:11] Going on
[2:10:13] [singing]
[2:10:14] with the Lord. [music]
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; You see friends, I want to tell you
[2:10:21] before with this piece
[2:10:25] in the Lord is a choice.
[2:10:28] Living [music] right is a choice.
[2:10:32] Not looking at certain things.
[2:10:36] living around certain friends, [music]
[2:10:39] listening to certain kind of music,
[2:10:43] watching certain kind of videos.
[2:10:46] [music]
[2:10:47] All these are choices.
[2:10:50] But you see the choice of the Lord is
[2:10:52] the hard way.
[2:10:55] But he can't force you to make it.
[2:10:58] That's why even in [music] to the edge
[2:11:00] he says I am outside
[2:11:04] and I knock
[2:11:06] but he that will open for me. He that
[2:11:09] will make the choice to open for me I
[2:11:13] will come in [music]
[2:11:15] I'll s with him and heal with me.
[2:11:19] He wants to come in.
[2:11:21] Would you open for him?
[2:11:25] How much [music] time do you spend?
[2:11:29] How much time do we spend with the Lord?
[2:11:34] How much time do we spend with the Lord?
[2:11:37] You know gave us the story of Mary and
[2:11:39] mother.
[2:11:42] how this lady was so obsessed with
[2:11:43] cooking and
[2:11:46] washing plates and
[2:11:48] so busy with the business
[2:11:53] and and she did not pay attention to the
[2:11:57] more noble thing.
[2:11:59] The one important thing
[2:12:04] is laying at the feet of Jesus.
[2:12:09] Before we leave this service tonight,
[2:12:12] Why don't we make that choice, that
[2:12:15] decision to spend more time with the
[2:12:17] Lord,
[2:12:20] more time with the Lord in the word,
[2:12:22] more time with the Lord in prayer,
[2:12:25] more time with the Lord in fellowship.
[2:12:29] May God give us grace
[2:12:31] to be able to do that,
[2:12:34] to be in his presence.
[2:12:36] Thus, there's nothing more important
[2:12:38] than that.
[2:12:39] Your job is good.
[2:12:42] Your work is fine. Your food is good.
[2:12:45] Your family is good.
[2:12:48] Eating and cooking and all.
[2:12:51] But there's nothing more important
[2:12:54] than dwelling [music] in his presence.
[2:12:57] Lord Jesus, we come before you this
[2:13:00] evening
[2:13:02] repenting, Lord. We ask that you give us
[2:13:05] grace.
[2:13:07] Lord, that we might spend more time in
[2:13:08] your presence.
[2:13:11] Lord, we've made our choice tonight.
[2:13:15] It's our own choosing. The prophet made
[2:13:17] that choice and you said, "It's the
[2:13:22] my way."
[2:13:24] And because you've made this choice, you
[2:13:26] made this.
[2:13:31] There was a reward for
[2:13:37] gave us that grace.
[2:13:40] always to make that choice. We might not
[2:13:42] be popular or accepted
[2:13:45] by many around.
[2:13:48] We may be called oddball.
[2:13:50] We may be called many other weird
[2:13:54] but because of your name, help us to
[2:13:56] stand to make that choice to make that
[2:13:59] decision regardless of what that name
[2:14:03] shall be glorified. Father, we give you
[2:14:05] praise tonight. As I pray that you bless
[2:14:08] the the people, Lord,
[2:14:10] as they go to their homes, go with each
[2:14:13] and everyone. Bless the givers [music]
[2:14:15] that have given, Lord, and those that
[2:14:18] have not been able to give, Father, may
[2:14:20] you open doors of heaven that they might
[2:14:22] have something to give next time.
[2:14:26] Lord, what has been given into your
[2:14:27] house, may it be used for your kingdom.
[2:14:31] multiplied. Father,
[2:14:34] Lord, we pray even for those that have
[2:14:36] been streaming this,
[2:14:38] Lord, and whoever else that might watch
[2:14:40] this service later, maybe someone in a
[2:14:42] time, in a moment of making a choice, a
[2:14:45] decision,
[2:14:47] help them, Lord, and this inspiration
[2:14:49] will help you. Grant I pray in the name
[2:14:52] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:14:56] Amen. God bless you saints. [music] Just
[2:14:59] remember me in prayers. I'll be
[2:15:01] traveling with a few others on uh this
[2:15:03] Friday
[2:15:07] uh to tomorrow. I know there are several
[2:15:09] others who have already traveled
[2:15:12] and others will be traveling
[2:15:15] but I'll be back on on Saturday
[2:15:18] uh after the function for the service on
[2:15:21] Sunday. So we just remember the service
[2:15:24] on Sunday prayers
[2:15:26] will help us also uh pray and remember
[2:15:30] the function at sister mas as well
[2:15:35] will go well and I hope how many did you
[2:15:38] give an allowance for the ministry of
[2:15:40] the word
[2:15:46] four
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; two ministers
[2:15:50] and three other people. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[2:15:52] Yes. I'm talking about is there an
[2:15:54] allotted time for
[2:15:58] ah okay how many how long
[2:16:00] about 30 minutes. That's wonderful like
[2:16:03] a whole service.
[2:16:06] It's going to be some sharing of the
[2:16:08] word there as well.
[2:16:10] So I think that's a really if each of us
[2:16:13] can learn to to you know honor God in
[2:16:15] our in our function.
[2:16:18] I think those are usually wonderful rare
[2:16:21] moments to catch some people
[2:16:25] because you cannot get to church
[2:16:27] to give them the word.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us remember that function
[2:16:31] on Saturday and also the other one
[2:16:33] tomorrow it will be like an outreach
[2:16:35] because both these functions people who
[2:16:38] do not know the Lord or not know this
[2:16:39] message will come. [music]
[2:16:42] Let's remember them in prayer. So God
[2:16:45] bless you saints.
[2:16:47] see you on on
[2:16:50] Friday night.
