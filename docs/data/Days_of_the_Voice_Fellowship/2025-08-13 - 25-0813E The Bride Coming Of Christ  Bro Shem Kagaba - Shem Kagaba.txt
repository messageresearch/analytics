Lord, you add a stone on the building. May you take me out of the way, dear heavenly father. And Lord, may you use me for I yield myself unto thee. Dear heaven father, I've written some notes. I've listened to the message I've read here and there, but Lord, may you come and take full control. [Music] and may be blessed this evening in Jesus name I pray. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you musicians. Maybe if you can first have a seat. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Once again, I'm happy to be in front of you and I thank God has protected each one of us and believing that the Lord will speak to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So our pastor is not with us. you receive greetings from him. &gt;&gt; I talked with him in the morning &gt;&gt; and God willing he will be coming back this weekend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Also, uh our sister Shama, I know she will stream this in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia. May God bless you. You know, she's the sister I told you last time. She believed the message and may continue praying for her with her friends as well. This message is precious. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whenever we come in the presence of God, should always feel excited when we are sharing. So today I'm going to speak about the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. That statement, brother Brham used it many times, but it really means the Christ coming in the formation of the bride. Meaning that meaning that the formation meaning that this time around his second coming uh he's not coming as as one person as coming but he's coming in his body many membered body so I believe that uh God is the one that gave me this inspiration and to those of this is going to part three because we have shared about it two times. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I had other things that I wanted to share about but when I prayed you know it's not easy to get some things to talk about here and then I felt God is leading me here. So let's first before we read the scripture the first coming of the Lord he was laying a foundation or we can say a pattern a pattern and it will be the same because he's the same yesterday and forever it does not change it's the same even in his second the way he came is the same way that he's coming. And uh I want you to know that his coming is the same as his going. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When we talk about the coming of the second coming of Jesus Christ, we are meaning the going the rapture. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that's why I titled this the coming meaning the going I mean the rapture. So and when you look at his coming if you want to understand the second coming because of course you have to understand if you are not to miss the second coming. And that's why the prophet says that the bride she is perfect because Eve fell in the garden of Eden. And again when Jesus Christ came and restored everything when the disciples slept again she fell. But now the third time the prophet is saying now this is the perfect time. He say that she is not going to fail. And one of the things that will make us not fail. is because that Paul says all these things were written for for our example admonition. Hallelujah. So for us we have where we can look and read and see the first coming of Jesus Christ. But those people could not see. Of course they had but for us we are better. We have we have the fullness. Hallelujah. So to understand his second coming we have to look at his first coming how it was. All the conditions that were surrounding his first coming, they are the same condition in the second coming. But look, only one thing is going to change. It is our response to those conditions. It is our response to those conditions. Hallelujah. That is what that is going to make a difference. So there are quite many things around his surrounding his coming [Music] but I'm going to pick just a few things. I also if I'm to ask a question when was his first coming? Can you pinpoint and tell that this is his coming? Is it when the angel went to Mary? Is it when he was born in a manger? Is it when he went in the temple? This day this scripture is fulfilled. [Music] Is it when he started his ministry? Is it when is it when John the Baptist say, "Behold the lamb of God." So the answer is All is his coming. It is his coming but in steps. Hallelujah. And when you look at his going still the same. So we see that the pattern was laid in his first coming. And now if you could stand and take the reading the book of Isaiah chapter chapter 60 verse one verse one I always say that it's a blessing to serve God and I thank pastor for letting us also do something serve the lord. So Isaiah 60 verse 20 say that arise arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, darkness, and gross darkness, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. Let us pray again. Lord, dear heavenly father, we may come and Lord just share with us, Father. &gt;&gt; May we see your glory and may we see your light in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. May be seated. So this scripture denominations they read it day in day out and they love it so much. Arise They even make groups. They call them arise and shine. &gt;&gt; But uh to us we have got the revelation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have got the revelation by the message today. &gt;&gt; Okay. This inspiration was combined. I was sharing with brother last time and then also I got this inspiration from the message shalom. Shalom and also Elijah and Elisha because after sharing with the brother I got some questions. So I went and I started searching and then I realized something so interesting. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I'm going mainly talk about uh if God gives us time don't worry I will not take long. If I could go through Matthew chapter 26, I believe it will be a blessing for us. Here Isaiah saying that arise and shine. And this was a prophecy for the end time. And now what does the prophet say? What is the light? Shalom. He say that what is the light? The vindicated spoken word of God. Not only the spoken word but spoken and vindicated like when he said in the beginning that let there be light. If the light didn't manifest, it would have not been light. Hallelujah. And then here he says that um yeah, he even said it here that outside of that there is no light. That son is the word of God. In the beginning, God said, "Let there be light. And when the manifested the the manifested word of God when the word of God was manifested there was light first God spoke it. What if it didn't manifest? Then it wasn't light yet. And then here again down he say that if he'd come said he was Messiah and he didn't do like the Bible said then he wasn't the light of the world. [Music] See it's the it's the vindicated word that makes it the light of the world. There is a spirit. I believe when I was studying I I I believe that you know the prophet said that the end time I mean the New Testament preacher is a prophet. So I believe this is like a prophetic uh someone if I'm to call it Because there is a a demon I want to deal with here by the grace of God that has come but also it is coming. It has come but it is coming like it it's going to increase its power. Hallelujah. And in very many messages the prophet has warned us [Music] And that is what is going to make us perfect. Because when the seeds were revealed to us, then we could be able to see all the tricks of the devil and see what is coming ahead. And when it happens, we know where we are standing. That's why this eve this time around she's not going to fail. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a brother I shared with last time and u he was telling me there are very many things on internet or website people speak a lot of things and mainly when you are evangelizing to them you come to understand what is in their head. So uh people they talk about brother Braham they talk about the ministry [Music] to bring it down to bring it down how it was for and also uh all all these Pentecostal circles these nation circles they also believe that he was the might man of God, the prophet of God. But he reached a time and he erad the track. So there are three groups that I want us to talk about. I want to talk about um these people who believed when he was just coming starting his ministry and then and then they turned against him later and also talk about the bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then there's also another group. It's also hidden in the bride. And this is Judas. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when you listen to the tape called um it's called uh is there a man here who can turn on the light? The prophet he was not joking. There was no joke. If you listen to his voice when he was warning us the time that is coming ahead. But he told us that don't fear. He said you'll remember this because remember there is a man who can turn on the light and take you through. Do you believe that this the the the squeeze is coming and the persecution of the bride But listen, he said that God won't let his bride suffer. He will quickly take her. Hallelujah. So there there there are these spirits that are there. There's this spirit that is there, but it is also going to come in full force. And also there's a brother that I talked to from another church now and I discerned his spirit like as if he's trying to bring the message. He didn't say it clearly but I saw where it is going. Hallelujah. So I want us to open together in the book of Matthew chapter 26. Last time, the first time I stood here, the last time I stood, I talked about this lady of Matthew chapter 26. And I realized later that many of you didn't understand the lady I was talking about because I asked my wife at home. She she was lost also. So this lady of Matthew 26, she's the lady of the alabaster box. And you remember I said that the whole plan of God of redemption, the Old Testament, everything was hinged on that little lady. And this lady, she was the she was climaxing the going of Christ. She's the one that caused his going. Because when you you read this chapter from the start, you will see that these people they they were plotting from the beginning actually [Music] from far in the beginning they wanted to kill him but they couldn't but we see when this lady came in the picture immediately they killed him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we are going to see what the cause was. But we at the beginning of this this chapter you will see that uh these people were planning. But the scriptures show you that they were not ready to kill him because they were it was during the festival season. Yes. But we see that this lady by her decision she made and and entering into that house. Was it Simon the leaper? I think. And she was a despised lady. But she got all that she had that alabaster box and she powered it on the Jesus and she started washing his feet with tears. The unwelcomed Christ but she welcomed him. And now from that moment remember these are the circumstances around the coming. And now when I talk about the coming I mean the going and you remember me telling you that you you are that lady that is the bride of Jesus Christ a sinner. But all she could do is to surrender whatever she her heart. And you know that heart the heart of a person is the most expensive organ in the body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So she had the most expensive oil. So when she powered it until even the disciples saw it was a west. [Music] But you see when you go to John, John will will point out specifically that it was Judas, [Music] the Judas group. Now let's read here chapter 16. The Bible says, of course, I'm jumping a lot of things, but you read that chapter on your if you can note down some a few things and you read it to bless you. Verse 16 say that and from that time he saw opportunity to betray him. From what time? from the time that this lady made the decision she made. Hallelujah. So we see that Judas was hiding. He was hiding among the believer and what you need to know that Judas is a message believer and he's a very precious brother. Hallelujah. Because Jesus said that one of you is going to betray me to the extent that John thought maybe he's the one. Peter thought maybe it's no one said maybe this brother Judas he was a very precious Hallelujah. But now in in his goodness, there were a lot of demons resting on him. A lot of spirits. And now these spirits needed something to provoke them. Hallelujah. And now this is the work of the bride. Now, &gt;&gt; so this is like a warning. It is there now, but it's really coming. Hallelujah. And here you can use verse 21. He said as they did eat, he said, "Verily, I say unto you, one of you shall betray me." And they were exceedingly sorrowful. And began every one of them to say unto him, Is it I? [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, uh, it's it's you remember I told you that it's the bride holding the last events and the timelines. Everything is in your hands. And that's why she's so precious. That's why God is trusting on her, waiting on her, but she's lingering. &gt;&gt; But anyhow, he's trusting her. He's trusting her and we are going to make it because God is going to give us grace. Hallelujah. because he's going in his first going we see that these demons that were in Judah they had to be manifested and from that time the Bible says he saw an opportunity to betray him to betray who his precious Lord [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now Judas, &gt;&gt; we see him going and uniting with uh the denominations of that. Not really believing in what they are believing, &gt;&gt; but being on that side as we are going to see. And also the prophet says something here &gt;&gt; that Herod and Pilates &gt;&gt; they also united. And then you see that the religious powers united political power just because of Jesus. Not because they wanted, but because of Jesus. Because they they wanted to get him out. Squeeze him out of them. Now here he say that in shalom he says that the darkness is separating itself from the light. God is causing it. The light is doing it. We see that there has to be a point of separation. It has to be there and this point of separation. It is not only the denomination but also the Judas group. We said the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; has to be on a certain side. And when the prophet preached this message shalom, he preached it as a new year message. That was 1964. It was the first message. And he said, "Shalom, God's peace." Good morning. That's what it means. means good morning. God's peace meaning that to the bride it's light. It's a a new day. But to to the church it is darkness and to the world it's gross darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now we see that for us here we have received a message and this is the only hope that we have that will separate us and this is what that brings separation a surrendered heart just as simple as that. The prophet said that the more the bride surreners, the more she unites, &gt;&gt; the more the separation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The more the separation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I fear a lot of things coming. May God give me grace. But we see here this spirit, it comes and attacks the believers. And it is a spirit of discouragement about the message about the message and shakes those that are not firm in the message [Music] and they fall off. Many have left this land because of some many things because they are not strong. They have not known what they have believed. Some have believed this message because of the cloud because of the signs and the manifestation. You see, &gt;&gt; but but the bride &gt;&gt; as we going to see &gt;&gt; she has gone inside &gt;&gt; and she has received the light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh here there is this um preacher Pentecostal preacher who came recently in Uganda. the one who came at miracle center. I heard him saying that brother was a might man of God but he eroded in his teaching in his teachings and that's what the Bible college also says. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But now remember whatever you say has to be scripture. Has in the Bible has God ever sent any man any prophet and he eroded? No. So it's un scripture. So it's another gospel. But we are going to see what caused this. First of all, what is the message? Let's know what's the message. [Music] M &gt;&gt; the word of God revealed. &gt;&gt; It is so sad. There is a preacher here in Uganda. You know him, but I've heard him saying that now in America the news have come out. The government has confirmed &gt;&gt; that the pillow of cloud it was wrong. It was it was not And you say I thought this is a person and maybe God used him even to bring men to Christ. But they are leaving it and they are going to leave it. But it's all about us to know where we are standing and what we have believed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And also you remember the Elijah the Tishite &gt;&gt; when he was going uh the prophets the Bible says they were the sons of prophets. So it's not it's not something so new but it has to be tried by the word. Because we know that these people, it is true, they got vision, they saw the the prophet going but they used it uh with their because they were biased and they added things. We are going to see why they were biased. And what did Elisha reply this Sunday? He said, "Hold your peace." &gt;&gt; I know. Hallelujah. And they kept on like I think like three times. And Elijah also he was busy moving from place to place. He was busy moving from 19 from 1950s 1960 to 1964 1965. And the Bible says that then God told Elisha Elijah to go to Jericho. That's a step. The prophet talks about it. See, but Elisha said as the god live, [Music] I'm not leaving. So we see that he went all the way. And each stage he was reaching, he was finding the sons of the prophet. Hey, God is taking you Elijah. He said, "Hold your peace. I know." &gt;&gt; And Elijah also knew his going. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not a shock that it's the sons of the prophet that brought the news. But they already knew. Elisha, how could he reply like that? because he had received a revelation of Revelation 10:7 because he say that the mystery of God that John I mean Jesus Christ in his second coming he's coming he's a lion of the world but when John turned He saw a lamp bleeding. Hallelujah. And I used ask I used to ask myself if it's a line why now hear the lamb. This lamp is only to the bride. You see when you are married to your wife you can even be a toughest man in the world. from work. Then when you go home, you can even play around. &gt;&gt; You see, so to his bride, he has reduced himself. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And also, &gt;&gt; yes, it is true to the world, he's a liar. He's a judge. He's indicting this generation. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we see here that John came to to prepare a way for the lamb of God. But not only that, he came as a friend. So, there was engagement there. There was engagement. So that's why the prophet says that this Bible is a mystery just one mystery of which Paul said that has been hid through the ages but now it's been revealed. So this mystery is all about marriage marriage. Hey, we are getting married to Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It may be somehow hard to swallow, but just follow him. the nominal churches gross darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because and remember I told you that the bride is veiled during the seven days. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we in the seventh day? Hallelujah. The bride is veiled. There is no one who can tell that this is the bride. That's why Jacob could not tell realized. But Matthew 26 verse 27. These are conditions surrounding the climax. The prophet says that after that lady making that decision in those last events thousands and thousands of scriptures were fulfilled. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. said, "And he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this, for this is my blood, new testament, new covenant, which is shed for men, for the remission of sins." Now I want you to compare this with what I've just told you. And also if Jesus said that this is my new testament, where is the the mystery then? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So all that he was talking about here, it was about engagement with his bride. Jesus Christ knew the price he was even before he left heaven. He knew because the call went out and they said who is worthy? There was no one worthy. But Jesus Christ being God being so merciful and he had a plan. He himself had to come this cup say that thou when thou prayest enter into thy closing and when thou hast shut thy door. Pray to thy father which is in secret. And thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee secret place with the father. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we are seeing here pray. So this this can mean our daily life how we should behave and conduct ourselves. in your house. &gt;&gt; Close yourself. &gt;&gt; But I want us to look beyond that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It &gt;&gt; is a secret place with the father. It is a certain dimension that you enclose yourself. Not your room at at your home, but in a certain dimension. God talked to us last time about come up hither meaning that is darkness shalom [Music] come up hither to the new day. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because to us the brightest is light. Let me tell you saints. &gt;&gt; You see, even those brothers can testify. People that we have tried to reach out to, you can preach to someone. If he has helped you, he will give you ears. And if he has really really helped you, you will come to church like twice. and disappears. You try all your best and then you wonder because the Bible says that is gross darkness. They can't even see that Jesus Christ is outside and then you just go back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you God do for you something He's more than able. The prophet says that the New Testament bride. Then he realized he was in another dimension. And in this dimension he saw himself on the lake. [Music] And on the lake he looked in the lake. He saw the rainbow strut. He calls them the rainbow strat. These are kind of beautiful fishes. that were preaching alongside with him. And now immediately before I read after that he successfully pulled that fish and immediately then he saw when he's holding a baby shoe baby shoes and then he was trying to put the sho lace in this eye of the but it could not pass because it was too big. And then he was like, "Watch this." And then the angel told him that how can you teach supernatural things to the baby? And I want you to hear. He said, "You see the first pull was when you used to pull your to put your hands on the people and tell them what was their trouble." The second P was when you know the secrets of the heart like I told you and said instead of you keeping that yourself you try to explain all about it and tell people and when you did said you didn't know nothing about it yourself Because for him he had just received a sign and instructions from God. God had told him to keep it a secret. But here he explained it and you've caused a big bunch of car impersonations. And you see what you've done. Very many preachers could even get anointing from his hands. and go and they start doing miracles all these Pentecostal preachers when you look at them they're coming either from Tosbos or Robert from Kenneth Hagen &gt;&gt; but when you see all the circles they're going back to brother Brham &gt;&gt; so what was the what was wrong &gt;&gt; he explained a lot about it, talked a lot and we got a lot of imperson impersonation. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he read and when he said that just then I I felt myself go higher up. I'm jumping a lot of things. And when I was set down, &gt;&gt; then I was beneath &gt;&gt; and standing up above a great tent. &gt;&gt; He saw a tent. Now you remember a tent. He saw a tent. I never seen such a tent. And I had just made an altar call seeming like alter. Yeah. down at the altar. &gt;&gt; And when I was down there, I looked and there was hundreds of people standing around the altar weeping. Okay, I think let me just read and finish. Because they had accepted the Lord Jesus and they were just weeping out loud and saying, "Oh, that's more like it like that." and and uh a real kind of gentleman walked out to the platform said uh while brother Branham is resting just a few moments this is the brother speaking on the platform that brother Branham is resting just a moment he said we'll call the prayer line and said everyone with a prayer card beginning with a certain number stand over onto the right. Well, I noticed the prayer line seemed like it went all around the tent and out and down the streets. Such a prayer line. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you read that message by yourself. &gt;&gt; But I want you to see something here. &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet said this that was the third P. And then he the angel said that don't say anything about it. It's not private. &gt;&gt; No, it's private. It's private. And we don't want to have impersonators only for the bride. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now here the prophet say that now here is something not slow. There is difference between the angel of the Lord and the light because I heard something moving as it does when it comes here at the platform at night. Kind of like uh and like a fire weeping around leaking blaze and it left me and it went right down over the top of the audience and went and stood over the top of the little building then settled down on top of it. H. And then when it did, this one that was standing by me behind me, the same voice, the angel voice, he said, "I meet you in there." And this is the third pool. But nobody will know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; So there is something I want us here to get. &gt;&gt; May God help each one of us because now now this is to every life of an individual. Now Hallelujah. Remember the tent as I told it it is the engagement it is it's it's the marriage because according according to the traditions of the Jews they usually use that tent and then they stand over it copying Sarah Ibrahim where they were and Isaac and Sarah Isaac and Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now here is all that he's trying to say. I will not say a lot, but you'll go and read it. It is marriage taking place. And then the light that he saw, he saw it moving. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So showing that there are few people that are inside there. Most of them they are here outside. Hallelujah. And then you can use people were healed in that vision of which can be both the physical ill illness and the spiritual illness. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why I say that even at the listening of the word God can heal your disease. God can take care of your needs. Now as the musicians come, we see this third P vision that the prophet saw. There was a prayer line and the prophet was resting. He was away and he said that he was looking. He was high just watching what is taking and people were entering one by one is giving them an advice to pray watch and pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it is all about the union with our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's why we don't miss any service. We keep coming. as much as we can because the wedding is taking place. And when when you're listening to the word of God, you give in all that you want, you have your heart, power your heart and said, "God, expose me." Hallelujah. And don't forget, the more you yield yourself the more we are getting far away from darkness and the more Judas is resurrected. Hallelujah. Amen. May God bless you. Let us pray.
