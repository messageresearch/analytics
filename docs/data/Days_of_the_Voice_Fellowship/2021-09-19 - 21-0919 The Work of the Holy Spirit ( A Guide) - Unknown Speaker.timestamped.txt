[51:45] by
[51:46] the grace of god we
[51:49] we had a wonderful meeting
[51:53] and uh
[51:55] before i tell you what the outcome was
[51:58] out of the meeting i would like to
[52:00] announce to you that we have a
[52:03] vista in our midst
[52:11] some of you remember the trip we took
[52:12] through
[52:13] about eight months ago
[52:29] can you come and stand with me here
[52:30] again
[52:51] come on up here
[53:10] amen we said god bless you
[53:14] so this is brother martin myself by the
[53:16] police up here for the shame over here
[53:20] we went to that brother
[53:23] brother uh
[53:25] joel
[53:38] now
[53:39] this was the team in a team that went to
[53:43] che guevara again
[53:45] and we had i tell you we had a wonderful
[53:48] time there babu leader 20
[53:50] children and
[53:51] i should say that the church
[53:54] there is now strong electromagnetic
[54:00] the the pastor there was formerly from
[54:03] the pentecostals
[54:07] and is a man who loves god sergio
[54:10] and we also held a crusade
[54:13] twilio ninja wairu they were meeting at
[54:15] a tree under a tree
[54:19] and
[54:20] [Applause]
[54:21] we went and evangelized around the area
[54:24] chicken and integrated engineering
[54:25] cartoon i don't remember how many people
[54:27] did we baptized about 2007
[54:31] about 10 someone said to me about ten
[54:33] between five and ten yes so i don't
[54:35] remember the number six
[54:48] but i think we need to
[54:50] stand with them because now they need to
[54:52] do their church construction
[54:59] donated land
[55:19] he donated land yeah
[55:22] and uh this land was his but he donated
[55:25] it to the church
[55:29] and so uh ever since
[55:32] they are believing the lord to provide
[55:34] for the construction of the church
[55:38] and there has not been a message in that
[55:40] area
[55:42] i would like us to remember that so you
[55:44] can be able to stand with them in prayer
[55:46] and also
[56:00] i would like um to say brother joel i
[56:02] don't know if you have sorted it out i'd
[56:04] like to have pastor mogisa
[56:06] for you to greet us
[56:13] brother you would have to unmute i think
[56:15] you can use the micro the camera sound
[56:17] the camera sound can be able to the
[56:19] camera audio can be able to do that
[56:22] so you can greet us
[56:25] and then by the joel you'll be
[56:27] interpreting for him
[56:28] to english
[56:39] i think i think you would need to mute
[56:41] to first remove the audio your source of
[56:44] the
[56:45] the speaker so that it doesn't give an
[56:47] echo
[56:52] can you try now
[56:58] [Music]
[57:00] if you can see him you just have to do
[57:02] it on youtube
[57:05] okay
[57:06] can you try now pasta making some
[57:08] commercial
[57:16] yes we can now hear you go ahead
[57:27] there is an echo i don't know can you
[57:29] mute your speaker can you mute your
[57:31] speaker
[57:33] can you first remove the speaker
[57:41] okay can you speak now okay can you
[57:43] speak now

[59:46] they were here on youtube because we did
[59:48] not have a bigger speaker here but you

[1:00:14] you know we do not know when the rapture
[1:00:16] is happening
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:19] we don't want to look at our situation
[1:00:21] now or our condition and say we cannot
[1:00:22] do anything for the lord
[1:00:26] with that
[1:00:41] amen amen we don't believe in just
[1:00:44] sitting back and letting others do
[1:00:45] something
[1:00:49] whether you are small
[1:00:52] do something for the lord
[1:00:54] whether we are two hundred over twenty
[1:00:56] or just ten overcoming whether we are
[1:00:59] one family or two families family
[1:01:00] remember be let's do something for the
[1:01:02] lord
[1:01:04] let us not say when i grow up i will
[1:01:06] serve the lord talking about when you
[1:01:07] colonize them when our church
[1:01:20] amen amen we are not building our
[1:01:22] kingdom
[1:01:33] so you may need to
[1:01:39] so i would like to
[1:01:41] tell you what happened yesterday
[1:01:47] uh we had a wonderful meeting
[1:01:50] i see that some of you we are not a part
[1:01:52] of that meeting
[1:01:55] because that you were caught up like dr
[1:01:58] peter you wrote back and told me that
[1:02:00] you were caught up at work
[1:02:05] i'd like to appreciate you for doing
[1:02:07] that wherever is that let us know you
[1:02:10] are with us and
[1:02:11] no matter what is going on
[1:02:16] um
[1:02:19] we we we we had
[1:02:21] several people come over and we were a
[1:02:23] total of 19 people who attended trabajan
[1:02:26] two hours
[1:02:29] and most of them were young people
[1:02:47] but the bible says the bibliogram was
[1:02:49] despised
[1:02:52] small beginnings
[1:02:55] so we therefore believe that it's just
[1:02:57] the beginning
[1:03:00] if the
[1:03:24] the program for our church construction
[1:03:27] has started integra yoko
[1:03:31] and just started in a very very strong
[1:03:34] way attending
[1:03:38] with young people
[1:03:40] pledging to do all they can
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:50] we had even a young child i think the
[1:03:53] youngest that was able to pledge
[1:03:54] something
[1:03:56] was a five five years old
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:06] and she pledged one thousand every month
[1:04:09] yesterday
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:19] [Music]
[1:04:24] will get food tomorrow
[1:04:28] no one forced her
[1:04:29] to ready but she pledged by ourselves
[1:04:33] 1 000 children sitting
[1:04:36] every month
[1:04:38] towards
[1:04:52] i think should be about 15 13 12.
[1:04:58] 11
[1:04:59] 12 11 12
[1:05:00] 1 and she has been having her books

[1:05:06] putting a savings there come over
[1:05:08] central here
[1:05:10] but she
[1:05:11] decided
[1:05:12] when she had on what what was going on
[1:05:17] she decided
[1:05:19] that she would break that box
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:33] she gave away everything she has yeah
[1:05:35] what day have you never had enough
[1:05:36] everything

[1:05:40] mechanism you don't know what that means

[1:06:43] to
[1:06:44] to be with their donkeys
[1:06:50] some are not moving tell them to stay
[1:06:51] with their donkeys
[1:06:56] you remember like when god told abraham
[1:07:00] to go and give his son as an offering
[1:07:05] abraham knew that to give is to offer
[1:07:08] before the lord
[1:07:12] whether
[1:07:26] he went with his donkeys
[1:07:29] and when he reached where he was going
[1:07:31] to go up on the mountain
[1:07:34] where he will go and offer his son to
[1:07:36] the lord
[1:07:39] he told the servants
[1:07:51] sacrificing his only son was to worship
[1:07:54] the lord
[1:08:37] which
[1:08:38] the lord willing we can use that for
[1:08:40] attaining land commander is that jesus

[1:09:48] blessed
[1:09:51] i tell you all those who have pledged
[1:09:53] something
[1:09:55] it is an opportunity
[1:09:57] and a rare one
[1:10:00] to serve the lord
[1:10:22] we also elected
[1:10:24] the people that will help us
[1:10:29] [Music]
[1:10:40] so if brother martin calls you and says

[1:16:31] two
[1:16:37] all right i believe everybody is there

[1:16:50] he will guide you into all truth for he
[1:16:53] shall not speak of his of himself but
[1:16:56] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:16:58] speak and he will show you things to
[1:17:25] amen i mean god bless you you may have
[1:17:28] your seats come along
[1:17:33] let's speak to him a moment
[1:17:36] jesus
[1:17:37] we consecrate ourselves to you this
[1:17:39] moment
[1:17:42] father i am nothing without you that has
[1:17:45] a signature
[1:17:46] my brothers are nothing without you
[1:17:48] naturally and my sisters also never
[1:17:51] engineers them coming lord they cannot
[1:17:52] be able to know what it is that you are
[1:17:54] saying unless you revealed it to them my
[1:18:30] this morning i'm speaking i'm continuing
[1:18:32] on our subject we have had on the work
[1:18:34] of the holy spirit
[1:18:42] and my subject this morning will be a
[1:18:45] guide
[1:18:54] the first two or three services on this
[1:18:56] topic of the work of the holy spirit i
[1:18:58] spoke on
[1:19:00] training of a child
[1:19:07] now you may realize that training a
[1:19:09] child some of you may think well what
[1:19:11] does it have to do with the holy spirit
[1:19:17] and you will notice that actually a
[1:19:19] parent
[1:19:20] a parent physically speaking represents
[1:19:23] god
[1:19:24] in the life of a child
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:32] and respecting your father and your
[1:19:34] mother is the first
[1:19:36] commandment with promise
[1:19:42] okay
[1:19:46] that if you respect your parents you are
[1:19:48] going to receive blessings in it
[1:19:54] you are going to live long
[1:19:56] and you will not suffer
[1:19:59] many people actually physically suffer
[1:20:02] because they do not
[1:20:17] represent the holy spirit in a childish
[1:20:19] life
[1:20:23] when the children's ability to exercise
[1:20:26] their free moral agency has not matured
[1:20:29] well the parent is
[1:20:44] a parent is there to
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:32] and now we notice that a parent only
[1:21:35] even nurtures his child until only a
[1:21:37] certain time in life
[1:22:08] every
[1:22:36] at one point in your life to sow
[1:22:39] spiritual seeds in your life
[1:22:46] but then come the time
[1:22:47] [Music]
[1:22:49] you have outgrown their leadership and
[1:22:52] you have outgrown their control over
[1:22:54] your life
[1:23:00] and you reach a time whereby you are now
[1:23:02] going to exercise your own spiritual
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:30] he was independent
[1:23:46] i want
[1:24:01] hallelujah amen then we shall not have
[1:24:03] so much trouble in the churches
[1:24:07] i don't even have so much trouble on the
[1:24:09] pulpit
[1:24:11] that's why i'm saying that no man has a
[1:24:13] right to stand on the pulpit to preach
[1:24:15] the gospel before they are baptized into
[1:24:17] the holocaust
[1:24:24] because they still need to sit and beat
[1:24:27] up
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:54] sometimes we can make notes of 10 pages
[1:24:56] five pages six pages
[1:25:02] and when i come on the pulpit i only
[1:25:04] cover a quarter of the first page
[1:25:10] what is it
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:38] youtube
[1:25:41] and go through
[1:25:43] every meeting is like three hours of
[1:25:45] studying
[1:25:48] hallelujah amen but while we are
[1:25:50] studying that book
[1:25:52] you see something was written in there
[1:25:53] one way yeah when they keep one and he
[1:25:55] said
[1:25:56] that there are two identifications of
[1:25:58] the true church
[1:26:03] in every generation
[1:26:05] that is the first church what
[1:26:18] it will always have the true word of god
[1:27:19] it's all good
[1:27:22] must be there hey let me know
[1:27:24] just come to make you shout thank you
[1:27:27] that is all good
[1:27:29] it must be part of you
[1:27:58] the thing
[1:28:12] and how can
[1:28:26] again
[1:28:29] we got a true prophet
[1:28:32] and that true prophet is the holy ghost
[1:28:35] he's a spiritual being
[1:28:39] god sent the holy ghost to lead the
[1:28:42] church
[1:28:48] now of course we have pastors
[1:28:51] we have a minister to another awareness
[1:28:53] and the prophet says that the pastor is
[1:28:55] the highest
[1:28:57] authority in the church
[1:29:04] how does he exercise that authority
[1:30:46] i will
[1:30:48] [Applause]
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:36] right so when sometimes you come to a
[1:31:38] meeting like this they said
[1:31:40] service again some people you know we
[1:31:42] just want to have a we don't want to
[1:31:44] have a good meal
[1:31:48] we just want to have a snack
[1:31:52] for a real good meal today
[1:32:08] just make present yourself as if you're
[1:32:11] going to interpret for the whole day yes
[1:32:13] i mean
[1:32:14] hallelujah amen don't worry i'll not
[1:32:16] take you for the whole day
[1:32:17] just a few minutes amen probably 60 or
[1:32:20] so but i wanted to yield your time every
[1:32:22] single day
[1:32:24] so you see that the holy ghost will
[1:32:26] teach the word of god again
[1:32:30] and he will stay with the world
[1:32:33] and one of things to come
[1:32:36] what does the holy ghost do
[1:32:52] remember i told you if you're a child of
[1:32:53] god you recommend you revolution
[1:32:55] and you don't have the holy ghost
[1:32:57] you must receive the holy ghost
[1:32:59] and if you say what i have not and i
[1:33:01] can't remember this
[1:33:04] i will tell you you must
[1:33:06] take and
