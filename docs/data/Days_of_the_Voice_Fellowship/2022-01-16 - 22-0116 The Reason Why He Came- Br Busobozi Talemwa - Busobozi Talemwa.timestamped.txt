[17:18] the lord saved us from a very
[17:21] which were what would have turned out to
[17:23] be a very terrible accident
[17:27] after dropping airframe in entebbe i was
[17:30] supposed to drop actually we're already
[17:32] in the car with
[17:34] sister still and some parts of our
[17:36] family
[17:42] family we're taking
[17:44] some of the children one was going to
[17:46] namidiango and another one was going to
[17:48] uh i now forget the school but uh one of

[17:53] nominees
[17:57] and so we were entering the road
[18:00] from sunday road
[18:02] uh
[18:04] you see the the oncoming traffic was
[18:06] okay there was no traffic police so
[18:08] there was a wall

[18:14] standstill so then those of us who are
[18:16] turning we are now turning
[18:20] back
[18:24] so i was the last on the queue of those
[18:25] that were turning back
[18:47] and uh i should say it was the angel of
[18:50] the lord that protected us
[18:54] by now
[19:13] now that the lord has allowed us to
[19:14] still be here i believe there is more
[19:16] for for us to do for him

[20:05] year when you were 12 20
[20:07] we we i told you to commit you know
[20:10] those needs that you had before the lord
[20:15] believe that the lord will supply okay
[20:17] so uh do not be gloomy about how good a
[20:21] supplies
[20:27] may seem as if it is taking you out of
[20:28] the fellowship

[30:01] and so i'm going to speak about jesus
[30:04] and my subject is the reason why he came
[30:08] here
[30:11] and i've spoken about this
[30:15] some years ago i think about three or
[30:17] four years ago
[30:19] when we were in kenya meetings i also
[30:21] did speak about the subjects
[30:26] so this morning we shall
[30:28] go over it and know that many of you
[30:30] that
[30:31] are now here we are not here then so i'm
[30:34] hoping that
[30:49] watch your masala why why why
[30:51] did he come watch yet
[30:53] and so i will begin with a quote from
[30:55] the message go awake jesus
[30:58] go
[30:58] go wake jesus
[31:06] [Applause]
[31:43] amen amen when you speak the word the
[31:45] word has created power boy okay
[31:50] he is the word
[31:52] but god had to use man to fulfill
[31:56] the song that you took
[31:57] to display his attribute over the same
[32:00] balance you see as much as the past the
[32:03] world is powerful
[32:11] and display his attitude
[32:15] god in the beginning was just
[32:17] was he wasn't even god
[32:22] how many knew that
[32:24] in the beginning
[32:34] [Applause]
[32:44] [Applause]
[33:20] but we were not made just to worship
[34:52] you see when you read the bible you will
[34:54] not find find a bat oh um you will not
[34:57] find a creation account of engines
[35:25] [Music]
[35:58] [Applause]
[36:22] [Music]
[36:24] is
[37:15] [Applause]
[37:29] praise the name of the lord amen so
[37:31] angels that's my america we are created
[37:33] for what purpose
[37:47] amen amen god always loves worship
[37:52] and do not worship something else
[37:53] worship god those things
[37:55] shall not sins are catholic
[37:57] worship or worship is a big subject
[38:02] you know
[38:16] and now
[38:17] i want to bring it down after he has
[38:19] created angels
[38:23] then
[38:24] before we come to our scripture here
[38:28] you know which we have read will come to
[38:29] it shortly
[38:54] read together one two three go
[39:12] now god is gone
[39:16] he has now become god that you have said
[39:19] he is not an object of worship
[39:22] so by the time we are opening our bibles
[39:24] that we are truly a biblical prayer he
[39:54] amen and now we're not sure you don't
[39:56] want to turn about that as we calm down
[39:59] whenever we took our way to kill him
[40:01] see god now begins creating
[40:05] more expressing more of his attributes
[40:54] [Applause]
[41:46] you know
[42:00] [Applause]
[42:03] [Music]
[42:35] [Applause]
[42:42] everything
[42:56] of loneliness
[42:59] [Applause]
[43:04] [Music]
[43:19] but there was no one creature which was
[43:22] an express image of himself
[44:39] [Applause]
[44:48] amen what does god mean
[44:51] that's not just against our tree
[44:54] yes
[44:55] object of worship battle that you take
[44:57] against the identity since you were so
[45:00] god
[45:01] created
[45:15] what do you think was the purpose why he
[45:17] was creating that man
[45:20] told you
[45:22] why
[45:24] can somebody tell me what was
[45:27] what yes my sister
[45:35] [Music]
[45:42] yes
[45:47] to manifest but you know you had already
[45:48] manifested these attributes through all
[45:50] these other things because those who are
[45:51] part of his attributes but yes also this
[45:53] was a manifestation of his attributes
[46:24] in his own
[46:26] image
[46:51] and i told you that you see because god
[47:08] created
[47:14] [Applause]
[47:21] was in the image of god
[47:26] and that's what separates us from all
[47:28] the futures
[47:29] [Applause]
[47:31] the real
[47:32] man that god created is in the image of
[47:35] god
[47:50] god
[47:54] not all of us are safe
[47:57] praise the name of the lord amen and by
[47:58] the time we we finish up i know you were
[48:00] well normally
[48:01] would you take a day and so we noticed
[48:03] that man that god created was in the
[48:05] image of god
[48:09] he was in the likeness of god yes
[48:13] and why did god create him
[48:17] god he created him for specific
[48:32] replenished
[48:50] no no
[48:51] those are not the right words conquer to
[48:53] subdue to conquer can somebody please if
[48:55] you have a record throw it out quickly
[48:59] yes yes okay
[49:15] the naturally young i am lord over this
[49:17] come away
[49:18] you realize that this is in the nature
[49:20] of man what's your my energy
[49:28] you find even
[49:29] [Music]
[49:42] where did this come from
[49:44] for who you are where did these things
[49:46] of gates come from
[49:50] foreign
[50:24] everybody
[50:52] over this entire
[51:05] [Applause]
[51:06] over
[51:23] [Music]
[51:35] wait wait wait and the reason we were in
[51:38] the right way
[51:40] because we are a part of god
[51:46] and god is the only thing that's eternal
[52:54] [Music]

[1:16:00] revelation 19 7.

[1:20:01] he ran away from the surgery
[1:22:50] is not allowed
[1:23:32] well
[1:24:06] and then we find that when god had
[1:24:08] already uh you know finished operating
[1:24:11] on adam
[1:24:14] wrong
[1:24:27] and god made sure
[1:24:31] he puts eve on the side of adams
[1:24:42] it's not god who chooses for you
[1:24:46] he designed for you but not the one to
[1:24:48] choose for you some people
[1:24:51] wait for dreams
[1:24:52] but in the video
[1:24:54] they wait for dreams but they belong to
[1:24:56] sister
[1:25:24] that's how god
[1:27:17] dying
[1:27:19] so sisters in the message do not propose
[1:27:27] are you hearing me
[1:27:30] so we don't want a bunch of sisters
[1:27:32] proposing to younger brothers
[1:27:36] again i could take our publication of

[1:30:03] and then and then he started natandika i
[1:30:07] told you there is power in the spoken
[1:30:08] word
[1:30:12] and the spoken one is the original seed
[1:30:16] and the word come and the seed always
[1:30:17] the man is the bearer of the
[1:30:45] sister
[1:30:46] woman system of childhood says
[1:30:50] i even see
[1:30:51] that
[1:30:52] you are born of my bones
[1:30:59] your flesh
[1:31:56] let me first think about it
[1:31:59] that they have already accepted it but
[1:32:01] they have pretended and when the man
[1:32:02] knows that she will accept anyway
[1:32:09] this is true
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:52] that
[1:32:55] [Applause]
[1:33:05] when we believe
[1:34:17] that i'll just take one minute in this
[1:34:19] one
[1:34:20] just like adam
[1:34:22] adam
[1:34:24] he woke up from breath
[1:34:28] this young man here um
[1:34:56] amen i thought it's always good to type
[1:34:57] the spirit on the physical
[1:35:25] yes
[1:35:36] [Laughter]
[1:35:51] and the young lady
[1:35:53] did not run away
[1:36:07] and so they want to announce their
[1:36:09] engagement
[1:36:12] engagement here
[1:36:15] should you not rejoice and be happy for
[1:36:17] them
[1:36:18] amen
[1:36:19] hallelujah
[1:36:21] you were engaged yesterday
[1:36:36] um
[1:36:48] but then she's she's uh and then i saw
[1:37:04] he came
[1:38:29] amen praise the name of the lord become
[1:38:31] a muslim but the air frame will be in
[1:38:33] brother robert's church on sunday for
[1:38:35] them to announce the engagement there
[1:38:37] brother
[1:38:38] brother robertson
[1:38:42] preparations
[1:39:11] is almost done with college with the
[1:39:13] university
[1:39:16] of madison university he's working i
[1:39:18] call her the young lady you may think
[1:39:20] she's in a senior too
[1:39:24] but actually when we were still in
[1:39:26] ethiopia she was standing there
[1:39:30] and she got done with education
[1:39:35] how do they call it do they call it
[1:39:37] aeronautic engineering or what what is
[1:39:39] that called
[1:39:43] aircraft maintenance
[1:39:45] and engineering yes so she repairs
[1:39:48] airplanes
[1:40:06] you know if these people mess up the
[1:40:08] plane if it is flying in the air you can
[1:40:10] easily crash
[1:40:16] that means that's a very important role
[1:40:18] they play
[1:40:19] a caller
[1:40:31] and so this is exactly how it was so
[1:40:32] watch the way charlie give me more
[1:40:35] minutes
[1:40:36] okay is that okay
[1:40:38] some people just arrived
[1:40:41] give me 30 more minutes
[1:40:44] and so i was speaking on the reason why
[1:40:46] jesus came
[1:41:01] so before we talk about
[1:41:03] why he came
[1:41:06] i want us to look to look at the verse
[1:41:08] we looked at yeah
[1:41:12] in
[1:41:13] revelation 12.
[1:41:16] verse
[1:41:19] quickly now because i'm saving my time
[1:41:21] i'm trying to keep up the time of
[1:41:22] request
[1:41:28] okay so we get to the next part of jesus
[1:41:32] and there was a war in heaven michael
[1:41:34] and his angels fought against the dragon
[1:41:36] and the dragonfold and his angels
[1:42:07] [Applause]
[1:42:26] it
[1:42:29] because we know that jesus
[1:42:32] was only a manifestation of god on earth
[1:42:35] yes
[1:42:37] you see but we know that god never mind
[1:42:40] now manifests himself in many ways yeah
[1:42:42] there is someone getting ancient so we
[1:42:44] say that michael jordan
[1:42:46] was only a representation of god in the
[1:42:49] angelic realm
[1:42:54] and so we see that when lucifer electron
[1:42:57] lucifer the one is calling the dragon
[1:43:04] he was one of the angels in heaven
[1:43:08] he was great
[1:43:36] amen amen and so we find out and i want
[1:43:39] to teach
[1:43:40] that
[1:43:41] michael timothy was an english
[1:43:45] what
[1:43:49] you are the interpreter so you have to
[1:43:50] find the word
[1:44:35] [Applause]
[1:44:46] hallelujah
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:45:26] he cannot be disputed
[1:45:42] came down
[1:45:56] already
[1:46:38] he's fighting
[1:47:10] [Applause]
[1:47:34] from heaven
[1:47:48] [Applause]
[1:48:30] foreign
[1:49:12] yes
[1:49:26] together
[1:50:29] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:50:30] and evil
[1:50:34] thou shalt not eat of it probably anger
[1:51:16] god will require
[1:51:30] foreign
[1:52:01] a man marries reflects his character and
[1:52:04] his ambition how he wants his future
[1:52:06] home to pay yes
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:53:09] hallelujah
[1:53:24] and so when
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:54:49] at the church of jesus christ of christ
[1:54:56] the heart is
[1:55:16] original
[1:55:44] the

[1:55:57] good for food and that was pleasant to
[1:55:59] the eyes and the tree to be desired to

[1:56:03] are off and did it and gave old son to
[1:56:06] the husband with her and he did it
[1:56:26] the tree of knowledge is the devil
[1:56:32] free of knowledge is
[1:56:34] satan lucifer devil dragon whatever you
[1:56:38] want
[1:56:39] to manage
[1:56:53] eating is hearing
