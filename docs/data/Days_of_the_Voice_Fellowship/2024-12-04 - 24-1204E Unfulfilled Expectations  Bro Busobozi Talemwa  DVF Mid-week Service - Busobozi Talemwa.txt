joining us by way of the internet we greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ uh also tonight we are streaming this service on Zoom evening light briac we would like to send our regards to all of them tonight amen amen shall we turn to the book of Second Kings Second Kings chapter 2 we are going to read um um uh 14 verses out of that throughout the sermon but for just the standing we can read um verses 1 and then we get seated to now namon captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his M master and honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria he was also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leaper 2 Kings chap 5 verse one uh Bible [Music] amen you may be seated please uh before we go to the summon tonight the Saints on Zoom I'd like to remind you to please register for the upcoming youth meetings if you've not yet registered it is important for us because we would need to know how many people are coming and how many mattresses we need to get how much food we need to prepare even if you're not paying out right you can pay on arrival but please register immediately if you do not know how just go to dvf fellowship.org and you can be able to get the link there this evening I'm speaking on unfulfilled [Music] expectations we are coming to the end of the year um today is 4th December we only have about um just maybe 3 weeks or less uh to end the year and then and then you know when usually when the year a year is beginning many people plan things and um you know by the end of the year I will accomplish ABCD so now usually at a time like this many people are feeling many of them that they have unfulfilled expectations they plan things and they see that my list is not yet Al accomplished maybe 20% or 30 or 40 or 60 or 80 some even decide to go into depression because they feel that time is running and they left behind and things did not work out the way they had many times many people go into um uh anxiety and depression because of unfulfilled expectations look at it this way if someone was to give you a promise and say tomorrow you will come to me I'll give you 1 million Shillings and you go to to him tomorrow and he says oh I'm sorry I don't have it you will have a broken heart not because you've not um not because he failed to get the money but because he promised you and so you would say why did you promise me if you if you were you knew you not going to accomplish it so unfulfilled expectations is a um something that is a source of many heartbreaks spiritually psychologically you know physically maybe some of you listening to me today you have unfulfilled expectations and you know to expect something you know it is sure deal and then it doesn't happen it is unfulfilled it is usually painful it is usually heartbreaking but today I want to speak on unfulfilled expectations and the Lord will give us Grace to be able to address um our needs tonight I plan on speaking on something else and um then the the last night I couldn't um get a hold on it so I let it go I just went to bed then I woke up very early in the morning and I was still you know pondering to see what the holy spirit will give me and I couldn't get it so the whole day I've been laboring maybe there was still someone praying oh God was waiting for someone to pray so that he can lay something on my heart and so I couldn't get anything until later on maybe at 2 3 p.m. today you know the so sweet friends I heard like a whisper unfulfilled expectation that is how I got that title and so when I got it I began shouting and rejoicing and then I said now Lord I've had the title but where am I preaching from and and so he began to lead me to um several courts of the Prophet but first he gave me this scripture on N the leaper and so we will really best on that as we see how the Lord will lead us tonight so the Bible says Nam was a captain of the hor of the king of Assyria he was a great man with his master he was honorable and you know I want you to imagine a captain of the host of The King he was a great man with his master he was honorable you know like we have MPS we call honorable and now here is something that really moved me he said the Lord by him gave Deliverance to Syria there is no one that is great that God has not made great whether he's among the house those among from those of the house of the Lord or from outside even Kings and presidents determines all those things so this man was made honorable by God I believe he was honorable he was a great man with his master he was a captain of the host of the king and the Lord not another God the same God we worship had amen gave Deliverance to Syria by him and so he was a mighty man of You' call him a great man brave but despite all of these accomplishments that n had n was a leaper tell your neighbor was a leap and so I wondered why the Holy Spirit Led me there and I began to look at leprosy and in the message the resurrection of Lazarus the prophet says leprosy there was no cure for leprosy they haven't found it yet only God can cure leprosy they haven't found nothing for it to help it but leprosy is a type of sin it sets in so gradually it is painless you don't feel the pain when you are getting it it's not like malaria Begin by headache and fever and joint pain and comes in so gradually and painless just moves right in my my I have it's like very loud brother if you can put it like put it a little down okay so they haven't found even nothing for it says just moves right in you don't know it until you are dying big white big white whats come out all over [Music] you Lim limbs drop off and everything eat you right into just eats you up Jesus was the only one who could K this [Music] leprosy are you following me Church he's the only one only the only one today who can heal this liy now this message brother bam spoke it in 1953 and I was searching by the 1980s they found the Cure of leprosy but you know I also found is not a really permanent cure because Li say the chances of it reoccurring after someone has been cured are very high so Li being a type of sin represents anything that upsets your walk with the Lord lipro represents anything that upsets your walk with the [Music] Lord I want you to imagine something that eats you up slowly something that you have been forced to live with you know you you are forced to live with it it could only you know it can be anything it can be poverty you know people here in Africa by the it has been said you know many people have gone mad they have become mental because of poverty one time I'll talk about poverty as a subject very good subject many have lost their mind because of poverty you know if you want to know how they can become mad just look at the man the husband in the home without money many men without money are very very angry they like a lion you don't want you to say anything why because there is no money but when there is money is all happy many many problems here in Africa that we have both physically and spiritually can be solved when you get money oh I I said I would talk about that as a subject later so you see poverty can be your leprosy disappointment can be your lios maybe you have an addiction it is eating you slowly is your lios some of you you have failure and you done many things and you have failed at it and you feel you are a failure so it has become your liy and others have heartbreaks oh all these subjects we we could spend a lot of time on them heart breaks also can be a big lios maybe you are sick in the body and you know something becomes an encumbrance and you know it becomes your leprosy fear some people have fear whatever they want to do they then fear comes and overwhelming or maybe someone wants to do something or go apply for a job or go to school or go do that and fear comes over you know some of those people you've seen them even they can't talk to someone if they go to someone older than them they're shaking they shaking no one has some of them even begun you know tears coming no one has beat there no one has said anything negative but fear has come over them it can be a leprosy some of them become hopeless and hopelessness can also become a lios defeat and I'm going to speak one by one that the Holy Spirit made known to me as I was studying and you know when why when your lios is mentioned right there you know God is going to speak to me you know when you become hopeless you you go into a state where you don't see hope anywhere no one can advise you no one can talk to you that's why hopelessness can make even people commit suicide a girl who had kept herself she can reach a point she's hopeless and she feels no one will marry me no one wants to marry me so let me go and leave worldly why it is the liy of hopelessness That Came Upon them and made them do that and some of them have a lios of defeat anxiety you know you think and think and think and think the deeper you think about the situation the more closed doors you see and so you become anxious you go into depression so it becomes a leprosy others have a lios of unbelief they hear the word but it can't enter joblessness you know complexes oh my these are all good subjects to talk about friends people have many many different complexes someone can have a complex that me I'm not loved and just from from from nowhere they wake up and think that they are not loved they wake up and think everybody doesn't appreciate them you know they just wake up and say I think this woman hurts me it's a complex some of them can even dream a dream after thinking so much someone you know running after them with a p simply because they had a they had a complex that says bewitching me that's why in the message we don't believe in wichcraft we know witchcraft is in the world but we don't believe that they can be witchers but in the world you know people just even a m someone looking at you begin to think oh I think he's going to be simply because of having complexes you do not have I say tonight to leave with any of that Li that you have was a leaper but you see the problem with he never laid in the presence of God there is something about the presence of God that when you walk into the presence of God every liy has to be healed every complex every problem every poverty whatever your Li is you see when you walk into that presence it becomes no more I want you to hear in the message the supernatural says notice this man was a great fellow but he was a leaper there is so many people today even even I'm sad to say but even in the Pulpit that there's great man but listens to man's theology instead of staying in the presence of God do you know there are many preachers who go to read other books and other stories and other fiction books in order to preach to people what is the problem you see they have a liberos beliers a true preacher will go into the presence of God to bring spiritual manner let me tell you we have been visited in our generation we have been given a super message for a super chch hallelujah amen this enter message is a super message for a super chart because we are going for a super flight it is eag food chicken can't understand it but some people are hands they are scratching scratching scratching but for us we are flying high and high and high high in Revelation we have no time to preach from CNN or to pre from Google amen let me tell you we have enough food amen oh hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and these Great Men you know they they go to theology instead of staying in the presence of God and there still a leaper having a form of godliness but denying the power they own they influential speakers they are forceful but still never knows what it it is to be born again not only pict even musicians someone can be so talented but he doesn't know what it means to be born again you are a leaper you have not entered into that presence to believe they have never believed in the Supernatural and they cannot understand it except they come into the kingdom of God he will explain it away through reasonings every time let me tell you brother give me the word don't give me reasoning there are many people who have come to this message and they reason everything whatever the message says it away I don't want to reason the world I want to believe every part of the world without reasoning it for he's never lived this man he has never lived in this atmosphere but a man this moved my heart ever comes in there he has to become a son and daughter of God then his nature is like God who believes the supernatural do we believe in the Supernatural now let me tell you a little bit about the supernatural the supernatural power of God happens by Divine unction no man controls it only the word does faith faith in the word a true Prophet minister of the of the Lord will always bring a message that will Asher in the Pres people in the presence of God I was speaking with the minister down in the South and we both agreed that to know that someone preached a powerful sermon is when people entered into that presence this message is not some intellectual thing we did not believe the message to just understand we believed the message to enter into that divine presence to be ushered into that divine presence we thank God for the prophet Mal because his message has ushered us the Believers into that divine presence a place where the supernatural a place where the where the supernatural power of God becomes naturally natural I want you to think about it a place where any time you expect a miracle you've heard people who have said that money was created have you not heard about it some of you maybe are here amen others who said food was created I had no food and food was created now to you who is reasoning you can't understand it the prophet said you can't understand it if you have never entered into that place but to you who have ever entered there you know there is something Divine Supernatural that can just Open the Eyes of the blind that can make the L walk that can raise the dead that can change a sinner do you mean a sinner can change and completely convert a small worker can change and completely convert a prostitute can change and completely convert are you telling me these things are possible this is what happens when you enter into that presence when you enter into the presence amen something Supernatural happens and takes place this is what this enti message is the en message brother is not head knowledge we should cry for more Supernatural I'm saying we should Cay for it if we are seeing less of it oh I want to see more of it I want to see more of it can you imagine because many people have not changed they don't they can't believe or even conf that Jesus can change praise the name of the Lord but let me tell you something today if you're a Believer even before changing you have to begin confessing that Jesus changes when someone is a doubter and he comes and is reasoning with the word even if you have not yet changed do not stand with them because that is the seat of the SC stand in a place of a Believer stand in a place of someone who believes amen that God is able to change God is able to change a liar a liar your lying tongue can change your immoral you know ways can change Your Lust can die your pride can die do you believe what I'm saying today God can change that's the supernatural power we are talking about and you cannot experience it until you walk into that presence praise the name of the Lord and so n was a leaper but n was a great man you can be great you can be anointed but yet you are still a leer you can be a professed believer but yet still a leaper that is why never trust someone because they come to church no don't trust someone because they are called Believers many times those are even the worst a professed believer who has not walked into that presence is the worst to deal with he can shat he can kill he can do anything are you hearing me Church why because he has not entered into that presence why is he worse because he's in a place where God is doing the supernatural instead of changing is becoming darker and darker and darker but let me tell you Brethren I came into this message so I can be changed I am not going to rest until every evil In Me Is Dead until I see Christ revealed through my life until I see the life of Jesus Through My Life praise the name of the Lord we have many n in the message we have many n in the church they will borrow money from you they will never pay they will cheat you they will lie to you they will do anything to you as long as it benefits them rather the Bible says prove all things hold fast to that which is good you know you have to to have a spirit of discernment to know who is who not because a brother is saying God bless you then this one is a very good brother see his life as he walked into that divine presence is he CH it doesn't matter whose son he is it doesn't matter whose daughter she is listen many times even pastor's children are the worst I am a pastor so I can say it boldly many many times Pastor children are the was they have never changed they have never walked into that presence so don't trust somebody because they are called Believers rather find that person to deal with that has walked into the supernatural presence of God and you if you were bornn in a believer's home seek to walk into that presence amen don't presume you are in it walk into it if your life has not yet changed amen cry if you have to pray if you have to fast if you have to listen to the message if you have to do everything you can because anytime soon Jesus is coming back and all the preaching will be over and all the church will be over and all the singing will be over if you are not filled with the Holy Ghost if you are not changed you simply be aaper may God help me tonight may God help our children to walk into that presence and in verse two he says and the syrians had gone out by the companies by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on the on nam's wife and she said unto her mistress would God my Lord we the prophet that is in Samaria for he would uh would God my Lord were with the prophet that was in Samaria for he would recover him of his depressy now here you see these syrians are taken a a little little girl out of Israel and you know she was now like a little Maid like a little slave girl and so this girl you know she's just so amazing you know this girl had lived in that influence of the supernatural amen do you know Brethren that it doesn't matter how young someone is but if you are in a home if she grows in a home where the presence of God comes down she can never be the same again can we have a conversation with Believers tonight the Bible says raise up a child in the way you want him to grow when he when he grows in the way you want him to grow when he grows he shall never depart from how many believe that to be the truth now how come many Believers children are not Believers how come they have left that way how come they have departed from it I want to say to you especially the Young Generation there is a problem somewhere how what are your priorities are you determined to raise your family as per the word are you determined not to go with the tide but to go with the word are you hearing me it doesn't matter what the world calls you the world can't understand the decisions you will take for your children you you I'm not talking about your parents I'm talking about you now you know the word you know the principles of the word and yet you would go and take your child to a school you very well know is 100% [Music] anti listen you are not raising that child in the way of the word are you hearing me tonight you are not doing it and that child will never walk in the way 15 16 17 you will be coming to church but not a Believer but I want to challenge you young people raise your children in the way of the word Bible say they will never depart from me hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah I was speaking about the Tim PR in Germany he told me something that really moved my heart amen he told me he said you know I brother B I made up my mind many years ago that I will raise my children according to this message if I believe if this message is the truth then I should raise my family my children by it and he said I I I made up my mind he had four children that I will raise all of them in the fear of the Lord and they will never depart from and he said I told my boy I said if you decide ever decide to go to a bar I will go with you I will go with you and your friends and I'll come with my Bible and I will sit on that table as you are drinking your alcohol I will preach and you will have no fun and all his children are believing this message are converted what are you telling me God can do something for someone he will not do it for you no he's a faithful God let me tell you I don't care about everybody else I am one of those who are determined that I'm going to raise my children in the fear of the Lord I'm going to raise them according to the word praise the name of the Lord and see here you know this was a little girl she was raised in the right [Music] atmosphere and the prophet says so they had a little girl there I want to show you the force of a testimony of a child who lived in a nation or perhaps a family who was under the influence of God she loved her master and her mistress so when she see n probably a good hearted you know natured man as far as we know according to history elishah had never healed a man with Leprosy there never been a leap heal in his but the little girl being raised and brought up under the influence in Israel Hallelujah go in your home pray and sing until the power of God comes down until the Young The Young Ones Will begin to Shake in that presence oh God give us that presence give us young people who are determined to raise their family like that amen oh Hallelujah Hallelujah that presence this child was raised in that [Applause] presence you know the little girl was raised under the [Music] influence you know you know being raised and brought up under or in that influence of the holy spirit yet anen and at this time I think of those living as aliens in some country maybe that are listening tonight maybe in UAE man Aria us Europe UK wherever you are from you see this young lady was an Arian she was in a place where she was not born she was a Jew but out of Israel she was conducting herself as a believer amen and that's the way we should do all the time conduct ourselves as Believers no matter what our position is no matter what our position is am I speaking to someone tonight there was a sister you know she was having a very good job in a very good company earning thousands of dollars and so you know they had a lot of parks in there no like you know U additions to the job one of those was gym free gym but but the rules of the gym was she had to go there with all these pajamas those small kind of things and you know as you would say like under under underneath CLS and you know she decided that as a Believer she will overgo those part well you would say she was losing out well because she was a Believer you find your company taking you out saying you go out and and you know you go out for a trip but you know 50% of it is imortal trip and you as aever like it's all right let's go it doesn't matter what your position is conduct yourself as a Believer it doesn't matter which country you are in conduct yourself as a believer at all time to give an answer for the hope that lith within you praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah the Bible says that these things have been heed to the wise and The Prudent and have been revealed to the babes the babes this little girl was humble to walk into that atmosphere of your Miracle of your healing of your deliverance if you need the baptism of the Holy Spirit to walk into the atmosphere of the baptism of the holy spirit amen the atmosphere of power you know power over the situation you're living in you need to be humble God reveals these things to the to to to the babes this girl was a little child but you know the Bible says and one went in and told his Lord saying thus and thus and said the maid that is of the land of Israel and the king of Syria said go to go and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel and he departed and took with with him 10 talents of silver and and 6,000 pieces of gold and 10 changes of rment and he brought the letter to the king of Israel saying now when this letter is come unto thee behold I have there with sent namon my Serv to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy and it came to pass when the king of Israel had read a letter that he rent his clothes and said am I a god am I God to kill and to make alive that this man that sent un to me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider I pray you and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me now I want you to see friends here is a king the king of Syria when they had a report from the little child you know wrote a letter to the king of Israel and sent there a lot of gifts and he said please I beg you heal my servant heal him of his and when the king of Israel heard that he teared his clothes and he said am I God that I can kill and make a life this man sends me this man to heal him of his Li I think seeking a quar this man knew nothing about the presence of God which was in Israel just like the king amen the Roman King the Roman Emperor he knew nothing about the birth of Jesus in The Stables he was born right there in the Stables but they knew nothing about it it took people who were humble enough now wait for this people who are humble enough to see the star you know to see the star you need to be humble and to understand you are blind until the star leads you and when they saw the star then they rejoice and followed the star and they start L them to Christ now I hear many people who say where I believe Christ I don't believe the message of brother they are blind and they can never see Christ because the message is leading you to Christ amen Christ was having our ministers Seven Stars in his right hand amen each star to each age and in our age we have a star brother and that star is prophet of our age and his message is leading us to Christ not the man himself but his message is pointing us to Christ but the wise and high minded they can never see the star but the humble in the ones who don't need to reason about but they simply to believe it they will always see the star and the star will lead them to the Christ and this was a little girl the king could not see it the king thought I will deal with another king no these are not King's things the kingdom of God is not for Kings the the kingdom of God is for babies if you are still proud and you can't kneel down and pray you will never see the kingdom if you are still proud and you can't humble yourself find time you go in your prayer closet and you pray until God takes away your lios you can never see the kingdom if you are still proud you are saying God will have mercy brother sister if you have a if you a leaper go in the presence humble yourself say Lord I still need another touch I need you to touch me I need you to move in my life I am not yet changed I need something that I don't have I need a supernatural touch when that happens you into that presence and that presence is powerful hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord you have to walk into that atmosphere for your Miracle God hides in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same praise the name of the Lord and we see here elishah the man of God he had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying where hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he shall know and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel you need to tell your friends they should not worry about their lipy let them come because there is a prophet in the land how many believe Elijah is com let them come we have a message which has all [Music] solutions you believe that we have a message which has all solutions I don't care whether we have not yet attained it brother I'm attaining it every day but I'm telling you this message has all our Solutions whatever Li you have just come you will know there is a prophet in Israel you will know God has sent a prophet in our generation praise the name of the Lord and I want you to see now follow me closely a prophet a true prophet will Point people to God and not himself when elishah called the leaper you know where was he to some of you who are good Bible readers did Elisha even actually meet this man elishah is not even in the picture at all only what he says we also are living in this moment hallelujah amen that's why we are called days of the voice fellow The Voice Fellowship evening light Bri evening light Tabernacle what is the evening light evening it is the voice the voice of the seventh angel we are living in this moment we don't when we say come see the prophet God sent a prophet we are not showing them brother Bram brother Bram is not even here he died and was buried 50 years ago but his voice is here with us the books are recorded the voice is recorded the books were transcribed and this end time message is the voice of God for our day we are now living in this moment when we tell people come and see come and see we don't show them the man we show them the voice hallelujah amen so n came n came quickly to see the the prophet with horses with his chariots and he stood at the door of the House of elishah and elishah sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash go and wash in Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come to thee and thou shal be clean how many times seven times a messenger came to tell him to go deep seven times this message is a Sevenfold message seven Church ages seven Messengers with a message to perfect and he [Music] leapers now accepting it is life rejecting this message is De by the way if I can't say that then I should leave the message immediately this message is life to reject it is death there is no other way way you can make it if you reject this message from Seven Church ages seven Messengers every age there was a divinely inspired truth that God sent through a messenger of that age that was the voice of God for that age and we have received the voice of our age we cannot reject it we believe every part of it hallelujah amen I Marvel at people who claim to believe the Bible but they reject the message or they said they believe the message but they refuse brother bram's interpretation of the [Music] Bible bam says okay plating hair is not a sin plating hair is not a sin and then the man comes and says no no no no forget bam Apostle Paul meant this which authority should we listen to you as my pastor or the prophet of the age the word comes to the pastor the word comes to a prophet and the prophet of the hour is the final Authority on the on the on the revelation of the word is the final Authority in in revealing the Bible to us if we don't if we can't say that then we don't need him but this Bible has been here for hundreds and thousands of years but the people have become more confused see how many religions they have each of them has a quote from the Bible but when God sends a prophet he settles the matter the matter is settled the prophet is in the land and his message is thus sayth the Lord and the Believers of that message are going to be healed of their Li Hallelujah if you believe every part of this message there is no way you can remain a leaper tell your neighbor you canot remain a leaper hallelujah amen you cannot remain a leaper if you believe this message you can not remain a leap amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah unfulfilled expectation when he came to the man of God and the man of God told him go deep yourself the man of God didn't even see him he sent the word to we don't need to see brother we only need the word we only need the message that's why we print the books and we give it out that's why we hear the we listen to the why because it is the word of God for us if you don't believe it suit yourself but I believe it and was W there are many people who are when they see the message behold I thought I expected he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord and strike his hand no and strike his hand on the place and recover the leaper I thought you would do that I expected this is how it is going to be you are in the condition you are still in because you expected things that were not correct and you have unfulfilled expectations not ab and F rivers of Damascus better than all the Waters of Israel may I not washing them and be clean so he turned and he went away in a r i want to say tonight church it's not about a better River or a better water is about having obedience to every word of God this message may not be better this River may not be better our churches may not may not be packed as they as are packed by thousands our music may not be better than theirs that's the [Music] truth we may not have the richest members in our chur we may not you know be the big we may not have the biggest organizations and better preachers our preachers may not have DD lld D and all that kind of PhD but I guarantee you this message is true Hallelujah expected he healing to come in the way he had seen the prophets in Syria do I want you to listen your answer will come tell your neighbor your answer will come tell your neighbor believe it you have you have unfulfilled expectation because whenever God visit you do not acknowledge acknowledge it and you miss your day of your he is visiting you by the word when God visits you brother s don't just slide down do stand up receive it Hallelujah I told you of that sister gave her prophecy and she amen and it came to pass two weeks later but message Believers even if they hear what the prophetic word they just say Amen God speaks by the word you want someone to come and do acrobatic the name of Jesus this message is higher spoken word power the power of the spoken word when the word comes you rejoice you receive it you accept it you believe it it will come to manifestation by this word and presence expectation shall materialize the word creates as you are hearing you are receiving faith and things are being created life is being created amen and one of these days your expectations shall materialize that is how miracles happen miracles happen by believing the [Music] word not by doubting but by believing every word praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah so when this man had the little girl came again perhaps another boy or whatever told him please believe what if the man had told you to do something big wouldn't you do it but now believe what he saying go down if you said go in River Jordan going River Jordan and the man humbled himself and when he humbled himself he went down the river he dipped himself seven times and according to the saying of the man of God his flesh came again like unto him the Flesh of a little child hallelujah hallelujah amen your flesh will come unto you again like a little child your expectation shall materialize you will overcome that Temptation you will overcome that fear you will overcome that poverty brother you will overcome that oh my God I believe that amen amen amen amen hallelujah you will have that child you know those are not Idol words that is word of God by inspiration amen must

you will receive the Holy Ghost you will overcome the world it must happen it must materialize hallelujah amen we are tired of leaving unfulfilled expectations and I want to finish with this quote in the message the token he says the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and been [Music] accepted now you can't get the token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price and the only way you are going to pay the price is pay it believe it what he said believe it accept it full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the [Music] Token full obedience not part of it as far as your denomination goes but all the word all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ now what if you was just all all in if you were all in but your feet is hanging out but if you are all in hands are out most all of us are in but the heart is hanging out the heart is in the world yet but we don't do that full Brother full sister full obedience complete obedience puts you in the word one you believe it every bit of it and all of it is in you and now listen to these last words and you oh my God and then you watch it working through you Hallelujah some
