[47:37] scripture where we have read in Exodus
[47:41] 12 we are seeing this was the children
[47:44] of
[47:46] Israelites praise be to God for the
[47:49] Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter

[50:59] Egypt he was so
[51:02] convinced and
[51:04] concerned and so

[53:50] Deliverance blessed be the name of the
[53:53] Lord amen and one day
[53:57] God saw that now the time was

[54:38] of that
[54:40] condition not
[54:49] until blessed be the name of the Lord
[54:52] that is the only way to
[54:55] go when Jesus was Sten from

[55:01] upper
[55:02] room they were there for 10
[55:05] days not one day not 30 minutes blessed
[55:09] be the name of the Lord but because they
[55:11] were desperate men and
[55:13] women they had to wait on the upper

[55:20] promise he told them in the upper
[55:24] room until the day of the
[55:28] Pentecost blessed be the name of the

[58:10] post with blood without
[58:13] blood amen and none of you shall go
[58:20] out you hear that
[58:29] why because the death angel was going to
[58:34] pass blessed be the name of the
[58:37] Lord one of these
[58:39] days one of this

[59:56] dangerous to fall
[1:00:00] like it is very dangerous for God to get
[1:00:03] a hold of you in his way
[1:00:09] amen did

[1:30:42] me you cannot fast at
[1:30:45] all I don't have time for
[1:30:50] fasting because food is everywhere Maybe
[1:30:54] or because maybe you have peace of
[1:31:00] mind you cannot come and spend a night
[1:31:03] at
[1:31:06] church or you cannot spend a night in
[1:31:08] your sitting room

[1:41:22] calling which
[1:41:26] we were called with the Holy
[1:41:30] calling blessed be the name of the
[1:41:36] Lord
[1:41:43] amen the prophet sent a message uh
[1:41:46] healing and what cancer
[1:41:50] is he was praying and said that in the
[1:41:53] name name of Jesus Christ I rebuke the
[1:41:54] devil of
[1:41:59] cancel may it leave
[1:42:02] you then I rebuke the stomach
[1:42:05] trouble in the name of Jesus
[1:42:08] Christ that it leaves
[1:42:11] you I rebuke that swelling in the name
[1:42:14] of Jesus
[1:42:16] Christ iuke that
[1:42:20] cloud let us pray in desperation
[1:42:24] the reason as why we are not seeing the
[1:42:27] result is because we don't pray in
[1:42:34] desperation Lord you know I was working
[1:42:37] the whole day I really want to
[1:42:41] pray that's why AP Paul says oh that's
[1:42:44] why Jesus
[1:42:45] says the body is willing the spirit is
[1:42:50] willing but the body is weak
[1:42:54] is that a prayer or
[1:43:03] excuse blessed be the name of the
[1:43:07] Lord but say let us pray in
[1:43:11] desperation watch for the kingdom of
[1:43:16] God it will come upon
[1:43:20] you you see the disciple were
[1:43:25] desperate their master was taken from
[1:43:28] them the first day things looked normal
[1:43:33] the second day things were still
[1:43:35] normal the third
[1:43:41] day this one was was
[1:43:44] a he was a tax collector the other one
[1:43:47] was the
[1:43:48] fisherman the other one was
[1:43:51] this the taken three and a half
[1:43:55] years not fishing Peter not
[1:44:01] fishing blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:44:05] and others not doing their
[1:44:08] activities let me tell you just leave
[1:44:11] campala for 3 and a half
[1:44:14] years and come back you will even lack
[1:44:18] where to begin
[1:44:20] from the rate at which the world is
[1:44:22] Chang
[1:44:26] you will reach think that in Old at
[1:44:31] old and maybe used to to live
[1:44:36] there and you're looking for
[1:44:42] them this man for
[1:44:47] all their master was taken
[1:44:54] sometimes he could bring up a eat bread
[1:44:58] amen just imagine now going back to the
[1:45:08] Feld Peter used to use probably they are
[1:45:11] now
[1:45:12] different blessed be the name of the
[1:45:14] Lord some try to go and try to hustle
[1:45:18] with
[1:45:20] life but because they were told
[1:45:24] amen the seed was
[1:45:27] planted and they had the seed of God in
[1:45:30] them I believe some the Holy Ghost
[1:45:33] something started speaking to their
[1:45:36] hearts said but he never told us to go
[1:45:38] back to
[1:45:40] fish because in Exodus where we read the
[1:45:44] Bible says they were told to remain in
[1:45:46] the
[1:45:47] house until
[1:45:50] morning they were not supposed to go
[1:45:54] out because the death angel was going to
[1:45:58] pass this men were told to rep in the
[1:46:02] upper
[1:46:03] room go in the upper room until the day
[1:46:07] of the Pentecost they not supposed to
[1:46:10] live
[1:46:11] there until the day of the Pentecost
[1:46:14] what were they doing
[1:46:16] there this is what they were doing
[1:46:19] there they doing this
[1:46:23] prayer is the most vital for that God
[1:46:25] ever put in the hand of
[1:46:28] mankind they were praying there are the
[1:46:32] altar
[1:46:33] praying Mary was
[1:46:35] pring Mary was praying hallelujah
[1:46:39] hallelujah she was moving maybe oh you
[1:46:43] promise he never say my son you promise
[1:46:47] oh my son you say come us no
[1:46:58] my days are going but I know you are
[1:47:02] coming no sir said God your
[1:47:06] promise je said and we are waiting you
[1:47:10] say if you don't go the comter will not
[1:47:14] come can you pray that kind can you make
[1:47:16] that kind of pray under your
[1:47:19] bed human brain is designing the weather
[1:47:25] the moment you lay on the
[1:47:28] bed the body will just think
[1:47:34] want so the sleeping switch will all be
[1:47:41] activated and maybe Peter went to the
[1:47:44] sea to fish but when reached there
[1:47:53] maybe the people are now on speed
[1:47:59] boats a man who even didn't know how to
[1:48:02] write his
[1:48:03] name probably the government had brought
[1:48:06] new fishing
[1:48:09] methods taking throw into the lake and
[1:48:12] then pull and say this thing will not
[1:48:16] work because Jesus had preached to them
[1:48:19] he had packed them they were under the
[1:48:23] word though they were not
[1:48:27] converted but they were a little bit
[1:48:30] transformed
[1:48:32] yes they were Justified and
[1:48:37] Sanctified amen they just waiting for
[1:48:40] the B of the Holy
[1:48:43] Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:48:46] then on the ninth day maybe those who
[1:48:49] were weak they started gaining strength
[1:48:53] huj those were sitting like in the
[1:48:56] overnight and maybe crossing their legs
[1:48:59] they stood out and they started lifting
[1:49:02] their hands and praying God is saved
[1:49:06] scripture started to come in their mind
[1:49:09] they started now quoting the
[1:49:12] scriptures taking God at his
[1:49:15] word and all of a
[1:49:18] sudden amen they are declaring their
[1:49:21] victory
[1:49:23] amen maybe they remember where just said
[1:49:26] it is
[1:49:29] finished father you said it is
[1:49:31] finished when on the cross he said it is
[1:49:34] finished he said all the power in Heaven
[1:49:37] and Earth is given to
[1:49:39] you and there came a sound of a mighty
[1:49:42] rushing
[1:49:45] wind amen amen and a ball of fire
[1:49:49] came clothing tongues of Fire
[1:49:53] it was sped among
[1:49:56] them Hallelujah then they got that old
[1:50:00] time
[1:50:02] religion and they ran in the streets
[1:50:05] started
[1:50:06] preaching blessed be the name of the
[1:50:09] Lord hallelujah amen because they had
[1:50:12] received their
[1:50:13] Passover they received their
[1:50:18] Victory blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:50:21] and that's what God is expecting the
[1:50:24] church he has paid the
[1:50:27] price but until you
[1:50:30] go and ask for the book a little book
[1:50:35] you eat
[1:50:36] it let us wait on our
[1:50:40] knees we approaching the end of this
