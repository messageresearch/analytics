Our dear heavenly gracious father in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

For Lord Jesus Christ, we are found to be men and women of many mistakes. But Lord Jesus Christ, you have always told us to come boldly unto the throne of grace and mercy. Do therefore come, Father, approaching this soberly, reverently, and by faith believing that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us of all sin and of all unrighteousness. Father, we do therefore ask you to receive us, oh God almighty, this night, Lord, that your glory comes down and your presence in our ministry. That father, you come and bless our hearts.

Those who are in captivity, may you set them free. Save the sinner, Lord Jesus Christ, and supply the needs of your people spiritually and physically. Lord God, take each one of us out of the way and come and have your own way. Open the word in wisdom and give me utterance to speak the things father that's from your heart and from your mind. Father that you discern the secrets and the intents of the heart. Gracious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ take me out of the way. Have preeminence total preeminence in the ministry of your people. I commit the service into your hands. Father, I have nothing to do with it for it's all in your hands. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen. Amen. [Music] Amen.

Uh I want to use a lot of time. We shall divide it. He takes half. I take half. &gt;&gt; And I won't be too fast. &gt;&gt; So I won't trouble you so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us read a scripture from the book of Acts 14:E1 15-1 17. The Bible says uh let me start on verse 14. Acts 14:14-17 uh which when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out and saying why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you. And you preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven and earth uh and the sea and all things that are therein. Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness. In that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. Amen. [Music] Fore! Foreign! Foreign! [Music] [Music] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Please kindly take your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you and reward your efforts. Whatever you try to do, whatever you are putting in, whatever you are giving away, whatever you are losing, you are not losing it. If you give it, you are giving. If it is time, he gives it back to you more. Double double. If it is money, he gives it back. Double double. If it is your life, he gives it back. Eternal. Just whatever you give to him. If it is children, Anna gave him gave him samson. God multiplied gave her more children like it is there's no loss in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your your sleep that you have sacrificed it will come back to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amina. &gt;&gt; Um, today I want to talk about my subject is but there was a believer. But there was a believer. But there was a believer. As I was coming in the taxi, &gt;&gt; I happened, you know, I didn't intend it. &gt;&gt; I just I looked in front and there was this young lady, not lady, young woman. Because a lady is different from a woman, young woman. And she was on her phone scrolling, scrolling [Music] endless scrolling. &gt;&gt; So she had nothing to do, no nothing sensible. And she went maybe on some group. Hello, is anyone here? I feel like vibing. I said, "Oh, if you don't have what to to to if you do not have something to do, the devil will give you something. If you are scrolling, you know these are days of endless scrolling. get your phone and you go on YouTube and you start scrolling and scrolling you don't you don't have anything you are searching then YouTube will give you an option then you stop a moment you look you watch for some few minutes it will drop you of that same kind another something to look at It will give you what to look at. You you don't have a purpose for what you are doing. If you do not have a burden for something, the devil will give you a burden. You know, if you have a vineyard or a garden and you dig it, you clear everything and you leave it blame and don't put there any seed. Trust me, something has got to grow in that. &gt;&gt; You just watch after a short time, you find it fully planted by with because you didn't have what to plant. But you plowed So if you don't have something to die for, the devil gives you something to die for. &gt;&gt; So that's what happens in the world. The people have no program. So the devil gives them a program. So when we if God has given you a chance and an opportunity like this and a program like this and you have come then you are moving with God's program if you don't have something to support the devil gives you something that's what always what happens you cannot just be there When when you have nothing to talk about, &gt;&gt; he gives you what to talk about. &gt;&gt; You have nothing in the heart. Satan puts there something. So you have to put something there. You have to do something. If you don't have something to think about, it will give you a thought. So you have got to meditate upon the word. But there was a believer. The Bible said that when Paul and and Barnabas &gt;&gt; went into Lististra to preach the gospel, these people when they saw the miracle that Paul and Barnabas had done, a certain man imported in his feet being a from his mother's womb who never had walked. But when Paul was preaching the word and he who steadfast beholding him when the word is being preached and you steady first behold the preacher it's not about the preacher it's about the one that he looks at the preacher when he looks beyond the preacher I look at the preacher but so the important looked beyond the preacher beyond the preacher. The preacher looked beyond the evil. The scripture said and perceiving that he had faith to be healed. When the man looked beyond beyond Paul looked beyond contacted faith something. Listen brother because there was a believer that was preaching the word of faith unto a believer and something happened for something to happen. For something to happen where the word is preached, there has got to be two believers for where two or three gather together in my name. I'll be in there. There has got to be faith with faith. The contact of faith. Something has got to happen. Friction friction brings a fire. So faith contacts. There has got to be something. And when that happened, the Bible said, when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Leona, the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men like the witch of end went to and said, "Call somewhere and she called and said, "Oh my, the gods are coming from there." So tell me how does he look like? So it says that they said the gods are come down and they called Barnabas Jupiter. &gt;&gt; They called Barnabas Jupiter Jupiter. Oh, murious. That was Paul because he was the chief speaker. Then the priest of Jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and gallons and to the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people to sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas. And when Paul saw this, he wrapped his clothing and said, "Sir, why do you do this thing? We also are men of like person with you and preach unto you that you should turn from this valley and to the living God which made heaven and earth and the sea and the things that are bear ring. [Music] Then he say who in times past suffered all nation to walk in their own way in times past. God left all nations to walk in their own way. Every man do whatever they want. The Bible says God wked at the sins of the people, but that winking is no more. But then he did it, but not now. And Peter Paul says, "Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness. God can't leave himself without a witness. He has got to have a witness in every place at any time. He has got to have a witness. It says in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful season, filling our hearts with food and gladness. See, he's not talking about the natural. He's talking about the spiritual. He gave us rain from heaven and beautiful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. He's talking about the word. He's talking about showers of blessings. He's talking about the blessings of the Holy Spirit. He's talking about the season of the Holy Spirit. You talk about the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; My subject is but there was a believer. It says God can't leave himself without a witness. How I came to this I was uh following the dedication of the church building in where pastor went. [Music] I'm not going to talk about church beauty. I'm going to talk about church building. But when you are dedicating the church, Bible believers, I was listening to the testimonies of the treasurer as he was giving the account how they went through. And it showed that at every point there came points or times it looked like they didn't know what to do at some point. But when those times came and the testimony was he was saying but there was a believer I said oh my &gt;&gt; I like that but there was a good believer he There is a time we had 30% deposit and he said some believers their possession even cars to to to somebody on the land. And then he said challenges came at their rental area and they decided to put a temporary structure. And he said when they made that decision to put a temporary structure at the land which they had bought so that they renting. He said that was a believer who felt a lump sum of money. I said there was a believer every time there was a believer and he said we needed a scaffold scaffolding to surround the entire building so that they can build up. They needed much from another church. They gave us all the scapula. I said I was a believer. Then he said we come to roofing we needed quite a great amount of money but we had only 50% and they were stuck. He said there was a believer from another church. He gave us the 50% which was remaining. I said there is something here. I said I'm enjoying this one. Then he said there's a time after we had constructed there was a believer gave us trees and trees and flowers said trees and flowers said then we needed but they didn't have money. There was a believer what God was doing. Give them a desire. Then you provide a believing a desire become a believer. There is a believer. God wants to do something. God comes to a believer. And when he comes to unbeliever, he makes them do something to the something for a believer. God works with the believer. Only a believer. It's only a believer who will stop who will stop hear God's voice out the task no matter the cost. It's only the believer that will be willing to submit because a lot of people I'm moving to and fro to about believer is not just a confession to other believer is a believer. someone that God has confidence. God said, "I know Abraham. I know Abraham." That was a believer that God stood and said, "I know Abraham that he will command his seat. This one, I know that was a believer. A believer is someone that knows God. God knows him. &gt;&gt; It is I 1961. &gt;&gt; He says he has no voice tonight but our voice. He has no hands but our hands. He has your hands. God has no feet, brother. your feet. He has no lips but your lips. But for him, your body become his temple. Be a believer. Be a believer. A believer and always there is a believer. It was in the days of Noah brother. The Bible says every man was moving according to the imagination. Evil filled the earth. Everyone took women whenever they decided even in the midst of those days. There was still a believer. Noah was a believer that drove amongst unbelievers and he was a witness and a living testimony. When God decided to save a few souls, he had to come to believe someone that would believe something that is unbelievable. Oh brother, it was beyond human mind could contain to take a believer that does not take God by the mind. A believer that does not take God by the mind but by faith. Your mind is too small to contain God. So God came to Noah who was a believer and he said you know brother let us build because God could not come down himself. Yes, he can. But his principles, he cannot go against a prisoner to his own what he's a prisoner to his own. He cannot bypass his word. That's why when you come to God, don't come with emotions. We appreciate emotions. Emotions are part of religion without emotions is dead. But when you come to talk to God, just emotions. Come with the word, you put it before God. He is a prisoner to his own. He said the word and he put it before God. He says, "Let us make and because he was a believer, he obeyed the voice of God." He stopped a moment, brother. And he said, "You know what? We are going to save cows. We save some goats. We save some lions. No, I would have said &gt;&gt; why would you all the lions will eat me? I didn't ask that. I don't see it in the Bible. He just and he stood at the door and the lion came in. I said, "Oh, [Music] So brother when was those days was those days before the fall after the fall but because this was a believer he could not he knew that God is what turn against him. No brother. So in the days of Enoch, there's no man that was talking about the rapture, no man that could think about it, no man that could was calling upon it. But there was a believer. His name was no man was thinking about pleasing God or doing something for God. And the Bible says that Enoch had a testimony that he had pleased the Lord. Which Bible did he read? All the stars he read. How did God communicate to him? Did he live to hear other way? But he was able to stop a moment and hear the voice of God. Stop a moment because there was a tinkling in his head in him calling a deep calling to the deep because he was a believer and he lived in those days until he was raptured that he but before the translation he had pleased God. Brother, sister, a believer is God is a type is God is a type of what God is going to do. Sometime a believer is someone that God does with what he has to do. He has nothing else but a believer. Not just a man, a woman. Once a believer &gt;&gt; in the days of Abraham and in the days of Lot, the days of Sodom, the the city of Sodom had so much corrupted itself that the Bible say when God came down, it said that the cry of it has come to me. The cry of Sodom. But who was crying? Who was crying for the sinner? Was it Lord? Could it be? Was it Abra? Who was he? But look, brother. He said the cry of it as he reached unto him. And when God came down, he said, "Shall I hide this from Abraham, seeing he's going to be a father of many nations, he said, I come to die." Then he says, Abraham, I'm going down there in the cry of the a lot of wickedness there. I'm going there to destroy Abraham did not say but that's the scripture wicked the wicked repent. Abraham was a believer. He didn't say well. That's the word of God. God has said it's going to destroy us. Oh sir say oh come a moment what 50 will you destroy the right because he was delivered but if there be some but As long as it is well with my soul, you are not a believer. I don't think there is any hopes for them. You are not a believer. Well, we are the only people. You are not a believer. Abraham said, "What if &gt;&gt; I don't know, but there is a probability. There is a probability. Isn't that really a believer [Music] in the whole city?" Because God can't be without a witness. He said I believe I not and God said if there be 100 I won't distress but Abraham said 100 God has come down what I want God is saying quickly What if I won't destroy you? Okay Lord, since you have permitted me to speak, let me speak. F10 say even stop today. He was interceding for the for that righteous man that might be in there. And there was a believer And God went for that gift to out the believer. Always God will choose out. [Music] You receive blessings. People will testify after the service. What's wrong with me? thing is to believe not because you came to church because you believe. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, that's hard to take in. saying that the blessing is to believe and there has got to be a believer because God cannot do anything except there is a believer. Anytime you see God doing something, you know where there is God, there is a believer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And where there is a devil, there is an unbeliever. Where there is flies, there is something. You can chase away the flies, but if that thing is still there, they will come back. So it's not about most times the devil. It's not about the demon. There's something behind. That's why would say don't just cast out demon. Let's find out why. Probably that place is dirty. Why were the Why are you slumbering? Something is wrong. A believer is awake. For there was a famine that was determined upon the land of Egypt for about seven years. And God looked ahead and he saw that famine was to come upon the land of Egypt. And there was no one that he could talk to in the land of Egypt. Hallelujah. And understand [Music] that the famine is coming. So God went to Israel. Hallelujah. And he picked the building. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, it doesn't matter. No matter how far God has to go, he will pass this city. pass this and he passed this and he passed this and he passed this city and he come to Uganda and he big and take him to Ethiopia and he said preach the word God brother sister he left and he went all the way to Israel and he brought a believer And he walked with him and they threw him. They hit him and he knew this one is a believer. They met him at this one. This is a believer. They threw him in the pit. But in the pit there, God went down there to be with his believer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he picked him up from the And they had planned brother maybe to kill him and he saw that and they could not destroy a believer from the pit. They sold him into slavery. God went into slavery with his believer. Brother I would rather be in the pit. But with Jesus, &gt;&gt; but with Jesus, they took him into seven. Jesus went and to be with his. Oh my God. And what is God do trying to do? He wants someone that he can talk to in Egypt. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he takes him there. From there, they sell him. They they throw him into prison. God went to prison and he was there in prison. He disbelieve. Brother, you can be there is where Jesus, without Jesus, &gt;&gt; actually a church without trials, &gt;&gt; it is not, it will never be consecrated. It will never be deeply rooted in God in prison. God follows take sides with Jesus. He takes sides with you with this believer. I'm from prison there. I lifted him. And he said now let us go to the throne sat with his people ruled the inter then that's when he started to talk you know he inter he told the dreams came to then his believer inter It doesn't matter where God has to get him, but he wants a believer. If he has a son of God here, a real brother like brother Dixon sister, if you're okay, I'm not saying you say that guy is all right. you are not a good sister, God will move and go somewhere and pick a believer and give this brother. But we we have been friends. God wants a believer to have a believer. He was a dreamer of dreams and an interpreter of them and a prophet. So the word of God could come to him so that God could preserve the life of the people. save them from their calamities. So God can pick you in your entire family to take you somewhere just to redeem that you are head to preserve life. But you have got to be a believer. First a believer. I've said first a. And when I say a believer, I mean a believer, I'm saying a believer. He wants that. When brother is talking about the squirrels, God wants that when this testimony is being told that the squirrels appreciated, God wanted someone who can believe that while the testimony was being There was no believer to say amen. But that is impossible. Amen. As the testimony is being told, brothers are not sing but there was a believer sister there. He said a man nothing but the truth and God say I want a believer. Then God came down. When God recognizes a believer, then he comes down. He said here faith the believer said now this one is a believer. When I say ask whatever you want this sister, she will believe it. Brother, if you they could not believe the spirit testimony neither believe to ask whatever. But this one, she believed when he said they were created and this believer said, "Amen. There's nothing but the truth. God is saying I the believer I want to do it again. What I did with you, I want to do it with this other people. was the faith that was with you to speak the spirit faith with this sister ask you what you want and sister at the salvation of there was a believer was a believer and she was there when the testimonies are being God and this is the testimony of Jesus. He demands or he desires or he wants and it is a must. ought to be a believer and when a believer believes something has got listen brother I believe sister would have asked for more like the salvation of my two boys she was poor some billionaire would have said to live. I want to live till the Lord Jesus comes. God would have and keeps asking. God was not afraid. God was not afraid. Listen brother, when God comes into contact with the people, he pours out himself, he gives out himself. That is where he puts his body. When he meets a believer, now ask what you want. You have defeated me. Jesus said such faith I've never seen there is a believer why is the plan stopping I don't understand this I'm just walking Lord what's the matter what's the Keep walking. Lord, the plan is leaving me. [Music] Oh Lord, they leaving me. I'm too God has a good time when he meets a believer. Brother, let us keep no sight. No, sir. I can't miss the opportunity of taking a flight. This is the devil stopping you from going to the airport. &gt;&gt; All right, keep walking. And before you know, there was someone waiting. &gt;&gt; How are you? &gt;&gt; How did you know I'm a pastor? There was a believer that stopped the plane. There was a believer that believed that the God of the woman is not today that is alive and if he's alive where is Elijah where is Elijah brother sister because there was a believer the plan is stopped and before you know there is my son And the son says as they pray the son says mama faith faith of the mother of the pollution supernatural friction fire came out It's right here to be &gt;&gt; Johnny today. Billionaires &gt;&gt; in the church brotherion. &gt;&gt; As long as there is a believer, God can do it again and again and again. There is no reason to doubt. [Music] Let there be a believer and meet God. Oh brother, just be a believer. Be a believer. See how you attract God. But God being attracted M brother rock let us go down there. Let us go down. God is attractive. He sees the children are praying. The mother is praying. The husband is praying. He loves his wife. She respects her message. just a good atmosphere. They reading the word. They keep themselves in that atmosphere. And God says, "Have you noticed there is a believer? Where have you been? Have you noticed? Did you pass the land of you see what is? &gt;&gt; What did you see? &gt;&gt; You know politics politician. Didn't you see? You know what I saw? I saw a lot of denominations work there. I'm taking over there. A lot of religious men [Music] gatherings in the chap ritualistic for there it's a good I'm having a good time in the land of my Oh, &gt;&gt; that one. &gt;&gt; Do you think he &gt;&gt; God said don't brag there is a believer? Have you noticed that? This is what the devil does. He comes and tells you have you seen that sister I won't point in anyone in this but I always sit there so tell you there is a sister that sister look did you see what she did when you out there what do you These people have anything around them just see what brother Julius did the other time. Come on. You are too forgetful. So can you convince me? But he won't tell you. Did you see what that sister how she shouted? Do you see how she dresses lady? Do you see how that brother is kind? &gt;&gt; He doesn't show you that. He will just always point you to the negative because he is the accuser of the so just keep pointing to you negatives until you stand to be the only righteous. When I look at these people, it seems I'm the only holy person here. I pray much. I really give a lot. I am the best caretaker. I am the happiest person here. I am the friend to everybody here. These people others have a problem. You are the one who has got problem. But I'm saying there is a believer. So what do I talk about here? That it has got to be that way. like in the days of the judges. There come a time that the Philistines were taking everything the people had and God is coming down and is saying you might wait a bit. If God be with us, well then be all his miracles. In other words, if you say, "I'm a believer." Where are the miracles of believer? The one we believe. This one was a believer. He wasn't a skeptic. Asking a question doesn't make you an unbeliever. If a brother or sister is asking something, &gt;&gt; it doesn't mean that they're unbelievers. &gt;&gt; He wants to know. So he says, "Where are the miracles of God?" He says, "You go, you will deliver Israel." Maybe he was a little skinny young. Oh, a man but just small slings. God said you a mighty man because he saw that this one is a believer. Can you imagine God was attracted? You left all the way from there and came. Say it. Now your mom. You are here doing your work. Your friends and brothers are crying. You are just here grinding your wheat. You are real believer. Others are crying. It's good to cry. You break down and cry and cry and cry. But after crying &gt;&gt; and strengthen yourself in God don't remain in crying you know in the book of the Bible says when David returned with his they found Their city was besieged and they took all the children, the women and everything. And the men cried, they all weeped until they could cry no more. Now, if you can't cry no more, the next thing if you cry and you can't cry no more, what you do? I'm tired, sick, and tired. Even if he's not a believer now. Now after Christ, you are a problem to me. Now, after all that crying and tears have dried, we want to see what you're doing next. Are you really a believer? A believer can cry. After crying, the next thing after crying, my brother, it is another thing. When the weakest of Christians go to their knees to pray, all of her trembles. Why? There is no wicked believer. Hallelujah. Is as can be. Hallelujah. Oh brother, there has got to be a believer because there was a believer and there will be a believer and you are a believer. I want you to turn around and look at your neighbor of them. You are a believer. You are a believer. Amen. You are a believer. You are a believer because God says sister. God only needs but a man. A man that is a believer. A woman that's a believer. A preacher, that's a believer. A wife, that's a believer. A husband, that's a believer. Children, that believer, workers that are believer, leaders, believers, then God can have a good time. The children of Israel just coming to an end here. were in bondage in Egypt. There it all seemed all hope is gone. But the Bible says that Amra &gt;&gt; perhaps one of the only ones of the nation would climb up a little stairs. He would go up the stairs. They have beaten me so much. I'm really so tired. But let me go up the stairs. Up the stairs. Up the stairs. Up the stairs. I'm tired. I keep climbing. I keep climbing from glory to glory. I keep going higher and higher. And he says, "Then I get down. and he prayed and he prayed until one day God came down because he was a believer. Maybe he called for years, years and years and there was no answer. But something told him if he was God in that day, he is God today. If he come from that day, he will come today. If he had the other day, he will hear today. There has got to come be times. You say, "But if He did what he did. He will do this also today because he was a believer day after day, night after night. Amra, why don't you let all these young men all these others to pray through all these young men they can pray through. He says, "I'm not so sure whether Julius is praying. I'm not so sure. Let me pray. I'm not so sure. &gt;&gt; I'm not so sure whether he's doing it. Let me do it. Brother, &gt;&gt; a believer. When the children of Israel were fighting the battles of the Lord, fighting after the enemies of the Lord, fighting the battles of the king and it came that the sun started going down and darkness was setting. There was a believer. [Music] When he said the sun is going Yet we are fighting the battles of the Lord. And this believer by the names of Joshua said, "Oh, son, stand still upon and moon in the valley of stand." This was a believer. When you're fighting the battles of the Lord and you see darkness is setting, finances going down, yet you are fighting for God. This is not going right and you're studying your family. Your home is everything is going upside down. Yet you're fighting the battles justice. Jesus. Stand still. Stand still. Stand still. The Lord. Stand still. Then Jesus will stand still and say, "What would you have me do for you? What would you have me to do for you?" Lord, I'm fighting your battles and your finances are going low. The family is going your children are going astray. The church I don't understand the Lord stand still then God is stand your battle. The Lord stand still. When he stands, when he says, "Be still. Be still and know that I am God." Brother, sister, he can stand his still in your finances. He can stand his in your marriage. He can stand in your ministry. He can stand when you pray. He can stand still and give you that question. He can stand still when you call upon his name. There is a man, brother. Darkness comes in. There is a man that can turn on the light. Jesus, the light of the world. So you don't have to remain in the shadows of dark movies. You don't have to be that. Be a believer. He says just be a believer. Just be a believer. And if there was believers then in the days of brother when he spoke the word is coming a church coming a people and he will speak the word and it will flash like lightning. It will flash like lightning. If your word is the word of God, I will call for a meeting to perform your word. And then he says, it shall come to pass in the last day that a brother shall say to a brother, I give you rain. And a brother, if you are here, you want the rain, I give you rain, in the name of Jesus, I give you showers. blessing in the name of Jesus because the commandment that God gives a believer is to bless a believer. You brother, he says, I am under instruction. I am inspired to to speak the word and see it perform you speak and what you speak &gt;&gt; shall be established. Oh brother, &gt;&gt; you turn this way. You turn that way, you go that way. Go to a believer, you need another rank. I had one believer. I had a believer. I had a believer saying he told another believer you need a rank. I give you that rank and I saw the testimony of the rank. What do you need brother? by a believer and bless the believer. Hallelujah. Amen. And today just right now in the name of Jesus, I don't care. If it is marriage, I give it to you. In the name of Jesus, if it is healing, let it come to you in the name of Jesus. All things are possible. You have waited, waited too long, gosh, God, you don't have a job. I give you the job and go in the name of Jesus. I'm under instruction. I'm under instruction by the word of God, by the spirit of God to give you what I've received. Receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. You are empty. And you are empty. Empty here. Give the spirit in the name of Jesus. Open your heart. Open your heart and believe it. In the name of Jesus, Lord, I open my heart. Let there be brother. If we were son of God, you are God. You are exercise dominion and power. You are called exercise as a believer of the word and said this. I want you today. I want I want him here. I want that one. I want do you know that a pastor had the right and authority to promote you? Do you know that the minister anointed you as authority to promote you to take you where you want they say you are connected I'm connected but right now right now we are connected to the spiritual whatever company whatever company that you don't have a connection right Now you are connected of Jesus because God own all these things. of God. Come on, brother. Don't hesitate to take it, brother. Just stand right there and say, "I go. If I perish, I perish. I'm a believer. I don't care. Whatever comes my way, my life is in the hands of God." A believer, he stands and he says, me yet. Even if God doesn't come, but I trust him. Even if he doesn't come today, I'll call on him. Even if they don't believe, I will testify. Even if I speak it and it doesn't happen today, I will speak all the fasting your confession. without wavering because in due time in due time it will come to pass. Thus says the Lord and brother through the everything through the trials through the fires through the waters. He says, "I'll be with you." And in Isaiah, &gt;&gt; he says, "I will help you." And again, he says, "This poor man, this poor man cried out to the Lord." And God prayless cries out to the Lord. at their cry them blessing in the name of Jesus. Brother, sister deliver us. The God that we serve continue deliver us from our enemies. What you daily serve, what you always serve, what you serve daily, if it is God, you are delivered.

Yet when the the back comes out there is a joy, there is a joy. When the testimony is getting out, brother, sister, as we approach the throne of God, brother, you have got to have a button for a button for something right like Nemiah. He had a button for the temp of God. And because of the battle, God came down and he got an unbeliever and he said, "Look, give Nemiah what he wants."
