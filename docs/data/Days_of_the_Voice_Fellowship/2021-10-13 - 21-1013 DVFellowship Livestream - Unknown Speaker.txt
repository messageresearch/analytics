message to us he has a very big testimony and even he never went to school but he can speak english no matter for very many years so uh he will introduce himself well but he did not come all the way from chiba directly here to kidawa that i'm not going because i was preaching but i streamed it later this surgery the preaching of the word the name testimony special songs so let us stand on our

our good [Music] that we may join [Music] for the holy spirit [Music] [Music] it is not the usual one you knew one golem is ango because they are curses they were the younger ones we wanted me to come here and i may judge them those cases we have specifically for me not for the person to need food because this place this place is uh in who is jesus christ we are the lower judges so that is how god has wished that i may stand before you some of you may not know me may the lord bless you those are and again before we go further we are going to read the scriptures because it is what has brought us we have come to hear from the lord come our favorite praise the lord 10 and verses 18 hebrews 10 18. [Music] uh [Music] amen let me read in english where all the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days say the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now where remission of this is there is no more offering for sin amen may the lord have a blessing [Music] let us also read in ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verses 11. ecclesiastes is after proverbs verse 3 chapter 3 verses 11 says then i looked on all the works that my hands had wronged and on the labor that i had labored to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit there was no profit under the sun [Music] [Music] [Music] it says in the blood of covenants covenants is a redemption munda may the lord be blessed because probably we thank the lord for being in this place for this place it is the one who god has chosen to very much at every time god chooses a place eden in heaven while you're eden there was eden no no no school eden and then the kidding of eden eden adam uh no school eden there was adam and the getting of adam [Music] [Music] which could enable man to meet god again yeah take a commander and that price was the lamb the blood once you were muslim under the blood that he may meet man without the blood whatever man can do without blood it is worthless okay [Music] you lose it and you have it no more you are in you look at message that it will reconcile you with god what is without the reconciliation there is death hallelujah amen do you love him hallelujah amen the lord even his [Music] your conundrum then you are redeemed when yet then then there you are fully redeemed free if i was at my house we are [Applause] university we are prisoners of our tv those days we are prisoners of sin of our christians but today we are prisoners of christ the way we obey the people because here there is there is statement here and asking for happiness there is judgment the church sounds [Music] but not to be judged to go to hell to saliva but we are judged that we may get to mercy because god is the word one side of it one side of it the other side it is the flesh is to judge the flesh is to forgive then the word is to judge negan the word judges the flesh forgives me i didn't come to church i came [Music] [Music] and those and those that have been forgiven are free from judgment hallelujah amen those ones everybody wants they are known judgment is not counted upon them getting justified you never did anything but about you they investigate to see whether you really are condemned at that weather sincerely oh sincerely for your now mother the investigation this angry manga only justified you are found justified today you are known you are not condemned you are cheating why we say but when the sin is confessed he take everyone's word under forgetfulness [Music] it says that he puts there m the bible has if it is god has brought me to fulfill certain things i don't know a way and even you who could tell you're coming but younger money together you don't become that you're getting our tickets that today is the spirit of god is upon me to preach [Music] good words to people ourselves the the prisoners but they will be set free our email the name to work ourselves and to declare the year of god [Music] oh this problem of mine ingenzi i've come to meet god that he may answer it again i'm not going back at home because [Applause] you know my desire cut on the boat the holy spirit not let you please say he has something that has broken him hallelujah amen there is only one thing to bring deliverance to bring peace that you leave god's presence you go away [Music] he knows that when the king is happy the gain of security yeah he will not remain the same cabal the king myself give a new land oh you have made me glad i've given you a car because you have met me do you think is in vain are you natural [Laughter] the enemy gets something hallelujah the bible says he will not go back the same but what the number if he had the debts he want to go back with the debts away if he had a problem with the wife this is a place because every person who comes by these praises they don't remain the same hallelujah amen you know when jesus was working it was the tree of life those ones brought their miracles the ones knew who he was and even they that he understood him he revealed to him his understanding i [Music] [Music] god yeah that was the mighty day when god entered into man amen amen commanders now because all had sinned they know my area man was worthy to meet god nobody had the authority to return to god to bring because god does not give birth by the flesh gamble but he gives back now adam for faith to use it but he may give birth to spiritual goddess children and then he took it back become our favorite praise the lord katunda god himself he remembers i am no longer had authority because we don't never go it is your nature it is your nature that is disturbing you repent and fall away you don't want the adulterer [Music] mosquitoes

right you may be a liar but the word does not lie yes you are jesus my word is [Music] to call you he put his path into you amen [Music] when he comes looking about when he comes looking he looks for those he knows he has only justice imagine amen what is seed because god [Applause] amen hallelujah me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] name yeah you're getting our work he spoke with us when he saw his
