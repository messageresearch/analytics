how many had a chance to go and attend the service at spec yest a few hands I know I forgot to announce it in the church publicly twice on Wednesday and on Sunday I forgot but we received an invitation letter and I informed the Brethren on Friday so uh if you if you've missed please go and uh listen to the meetings yesterday and also today they are having uh as we are here they also having another service with the Vista and he will be preaching at the last service tonight so if you can uh be able to go at the church in Zana this evening it will be good so you can be able to attend there and be blessed brother kmas maduka is uh his ministry really is helping the young people uh because he has a a good testimony but also it's a life experience for somebody who has made a lot of money but he loves God with all his heart and is's a good example of Success With God I actually spoke to him yesterday and also spoke to Pastor Gideon and the Lord willing this Monday he will be at the bench with us so uh how many so brother prin testimony on the bench we have started that testimony that program called the bench the bench with P so putting different people on the bench we sit down and get to hear their testimony and so if the Lord makes it happen and possible this Monday afternoon that is tomorrow we will be right here and if you want to come and have a first hand you can come and sit uh we usually turn this into a [Music] studio and we usually sit here so anybody who want to participate and maybe just listen F hand you can come and get seated here on Monday we will announce the time so before we go to the word uh I just wanted to first of all appreciate you uh the church here for your commitment towards the contribution of the land fund please clap for yourselves last week we contributed about 98,000 and uh and uh that was a good start I know some people have said it is difficult it is uh you know P pestering the people uh it is putting people in pressure um that could all be true but also we need to learn something that if you are going to get anything good in life you have to be determined to get it you know if you're not determined and you not committed you can never get anything uh Israel was given and promised the land but they had to take it by force when they got there others were very discouraged but the few who were encouraged Joshua and calb did not play around and they encouraged the whole team they said give me my Mountain I think it was Cal said give me my mountain and you know he had to take his possession by force because he had a promise so it's not easy nothing good is received easy and so we are not pressuring anybody we we these are free will control RS and you are free to give as much as you can but also give generously and let me tell you a secret throughout this entire process as we give you are going to see a lot of financial breakthrough in our church especially to those who are giving generously generous does not mean giving much it means giving with an abundant heart and a willing heart and you give as much as your heart has been you know Desiring to give and so if you want to give generously you cannot give little when you have much more so you give as God has blessed you and then he will give you more for you to give so don't feel pressured if you can only afford a little don't say I've heard of some who say well now how can we you know others are putting 50,000 25 15 how can I give my 500 Shillings 1,000s do not feel bad about any contribution God sees your and he will bless you if it's 1,000 you have give it give it uh With A Generous Heart and God will bless you amen so we are not uh I'm just going to read for you Paul um this week has given 104,000 [Applause] I'm trying to see the uh uh the the list last week our brother our brother Andrew is my vice chair so he was supposed to read these things but he's not around this morning they went with his wife to uh to to be able to GRE greet the church where the sister came from and also to you know appreciate them for supporting them in the wedding okay so uh I'll just continue I cannot find the one for last week yet so Paul has given that much and thenan the Believers in Paul God bless you so much bless God bless you so much Iranians they have given 157,000 God bless you so so much for that generous contribution amen and Martin who was last has said I'm not going to be the way I was I remember Martin because Martin I think gave 10,000 but this week they have given 55,000 oh my that's wonderful God bless you so much Martin was it Martin who who gave 10,000 last brother lawyer okay wait yes yes yes I've got the figures for last Sunday yeah Sunday it was Martin so this week they actually they have multiplied their more than any other group this week although we asking them to step up step up high but God bless them so much Columba and by the way if you hear Martin or a group giving less and you are not part of this of any group go and join that group and give more so you can step them up Columba has given uh oh Columba has also improved last week they gave 112 So this suay they have given 143,00 God bless you Columba amen and and Martin Luther Martin Lu which a part of today we but we are still the best we have given 265,000 last week we gave 304,000 something something Martin Luther please don't down keep going up John wisley I think has more than because last Sunday they gave 166 they have given 55,000 but we appreciate johnley for for that contribution amen and William Bram William Bram H I think William Bram has doubl there more than no wonder is the generation we is our messenger last week they gave 140 this week they have given 236,000 Hallelujah God bless you William Hallelujah wonderful wonderful wonderful amen we really appreciate you brothers and sisters the team leaders you're doing a great job not only look at the church add even your friends let me tell you team leaders tell each of your friends to bring five of their friends who are willing to contribute to this purpose because the church we the land we are going to buy and the church we are going to build there is not only for us it's for the whole community chch is a public place so have a broad mind invite everybody in and let them participate and so this this week we have given more than last Sunday and uh we have given a total amount of 1 million 15,500 Hallelujah hallu I say we should clap a little more in thanks to the Lord for that Milestone Hallelujah whether the devil likes it or not we are buying this land we are buying this amen and I once again I would like to apologize um next Sunday we shall do a better job of giving you further reports cuz we need to put this and add it to the last Sunday and the entire amount and keep updating you with the details when my assistant is here next Sunday I'm sure he will do a better job so it's almost mid midday and I'm requesting you for one hour hour and a half so you keep your thoughts together do not count time uh let us be here 100% and because I have a message in my heart for the especially this goes to the young people many have been asking me questions some here in the church and others also out of the church and I thought for about 3 weeks I've wanted to deal with this uh but I think I should deal with it today I'm going to speak on the approach to marriage approach the the way you [Music] approach the approach to marriage yes that is better yes the way you enter into marriage no the approach to marriage so now this is not only going to help the younger people but also the parents because you have children and you want don't think about yourself also think about your children because in a few years from now many of you your children are going to get married you need to to guide them properly so before we go to the award especially because of this program that we started the interviews we really needed a second camera and uh the Isaac the brother in the media Department told me we need um this camera cost about uh about 15 million uh but he had found one person only who has it in the city and he has it in second hand and they can give it to us at 7 Millions so I contacted the man and we negot with him down to mil some people have told me I'm a good negotiator I I hope they are right because it was successful this time from Seven went to five and I told him look by faith I had to give what I had and I took it out of the church account believing that God will supply and will be able to put it back and so I took 2 million Shillings I told him I have 2 million shs I'm going to pay it right away and then the 3 Millions we shall give it in two months he said two months is Big actually I said three months he said three months is big two months so we have to pay 1.5 1.5 for the next two months and as I was still you know Isaac was still in town then I was contacted by one of us here sister asking me Pastor how much is a camera like the one we use at church I told her well right now we are buying one and I told her like what I've told you she said I will contribute for sure so somehow she asked the right question at the right time so uh and I think that's the over there these things in the media Department are very expensive but when I see the people that are blessed because of what they receive from us I really feel that this is nothing compared to the souls that are impacted in their lives so if you feel to support that as well it is an opportunity to receive a blessing praise the Lord shall We Stand uh while we um have our Bibles open to Genesis 2 vers 18 so we are going to read before we're going to pray before we let's pray our loving Jesus we would like to thank you this this morning for the opportunity you have given to us Lord to gather here many have come from different places some from Far others from near Lord I know even some have traveled uh from as far as just to be here Lord in this service and from other places as well father I ask that you will let our gathering not be in vain and even others that are streaming with us maybe they are part of this fellowship and not able to come or maybe they from another location but they've been led to stream with us this morning maybe others will watch this after they have attended their church service Lord I pray that it will be a blessing Lord everybody that will be under the sound of the voice this morning may you uh impact their lives Lead Me Lord guide me and inspire me that what I speak Lord will uh Avail much spiritually to your people father Lord we ask your blessing [Music] amen and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him and help meet for [Music] him God bless you you may be seated well of course one of the other reasons I'm taking this subject is because uh since after the wedding of brother uh of brother Andrew and also the prayer we prayed at the beginning of the year it looks like we have a lot of Dynamics going on in the church for people who want to get into marriage and I've noticed that many of them ask questions the same questions repeated so I thought I should just deal with it today so that we can set a standard on what we believe here and how we believe is the right approach to marriage now matters regarding marriage um will vary in understanding from church to church and so I just want you to hear what we believe and if you have any questions afterwards we can also deal with those so I I want to also read Hebrews 13:4 just one verse marriage is Honorable in all and the bed and defiled but war mongers and adulterers God will judge [Music] so now I'm going to begin it this way looking at Genesis CH 2 ver8 where he says it is not good that the man should be alone so the first question is why is it not good that the man should be I'm going to answer this question with several other scriptures in the Book of Ecclesiastes 4 verse 9 it says two are better than one because they have a good reward for their [Music] labor so if you one you are good but if you are two you it is better why because you have a good reward for your labor for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow many times you realize to you who are married when you are downcast you know like yesterday had you know issues with this and that and so I was just a little bit done cast but my wife you know took to encouraging [Music] me you know she started talking to me as if she was my pastor and after the talking I felt a bit better so you see if you are two if one Falls the one will lift up his fellow but why to him that is alone when he fth for he has not another to help him up you are only by yourself and you know you are you're battling with your thoughts you don't trust anybody because you cannot share with them your secrets but when you have another one with you you can be able to share your secrets that's why never trust a married person and tell them telling you don't tell your wife I telling you the reality they will always share with their wives that is the truth if if that marriage is healthy they will always share information that is what marriage is all about you know and so they will share with one another and so the other will lift up another one but if you are only one you don't have another one to help you to get up when you're down again if two lie together then they have heat so imagine he says but how can one be warm alone you see that's another reason why it is not good for a man to be alone that's why it is not good for married people to live apart opens channels and ways for adultery because the Bible says when you are called you know and you have another one with you then you will have Heats then the bed will be warm but imagine if it is the cold season and you're all by yourself the devil is going to begin attacking you of this and that and immoral living but you see how can one be warm alone and if one Prevail against him two shall withand him praise the name of the Lord so apart from one there is also you know when you are attacked you know when you attacked but you have your friend you are together with your wife or husband you know you will with with stand that person that comes to attack you you will withand that Spirit which comes to attack you you will pray together you will believe together you will plan together you know that's what marriage is all about and then he says under three fold C is not quickly broken a threefold c now here is not talking about two wives one husband he's talking about one wife one husband and Goden if you are married and you have your wife and you know you have God in that marriage that marriage is not quickly broken you see many marriages that break it down is because they do not build their house on the basis of God on the laws of God but if a family is started on the on the right basis and that is Jesus Christ that family is not quickly broken the devil can try to fight devil can come from here from there from here but the devil cannot quickly break it he has tried to break some not easily not easily and even when he breaks them as long as God is still there those families always come back again together so if you from a marriage that is broken and you are here you just make sure God is there Whoever has left that c will come back again if it is your wife he will come she will come back again if it's your husband he will come back again a three-fold cod is not quickly broken and so we are still answering why it is not good for a man to be praise the Lord I know you are listening but I want more of your amens if you are quiet I will go dry my gift rides on your on your receiving that amen Proverbs 122 A Good Man obtain favor of the Lord but a man of wicked devices will he condemn so now if the Bible says if you are good look at yourself man if you are good you obtain favor from God now the question is are you good as far as God is concerned if you are good you obtain favor from God and how do we know you obtain favor from God Proverbs 1822 whoever find a wife find a good things and obtain favor of the Lord so in other words it is not good for a man to be but when a man finds a wife he finds a good thing and he obtains favor from God so in other words when God gives you a wife it is God's testimony about you that you are good so if you don't have one may God testimony against you praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord okay 1 Corinthians 78 all right I'm still answering the same question I say therefore to the unmarried and [Music] widows it is good for them if they abide even as I not like me because me he's talking about apost Paul he was not married so it was he says it is good you remain like me but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn you know people use a lot of things that are so funny you find them they have Toys you know they play with themselves you find them you know and many of these are Christians believers they in churches why you are burning brother you are burning sister and the Bible says it is better for you to marry than to burn no Amen on that no Amen on that what you to say Amen marriage is is not worldly it is spiritual it is not a want it is a need it's not a want it is a need are you are you hearing me you young people to say Amen don't beh so spiritual this morning but but if they cannot contain let them marry but it is better to marry than to burn why does he even say this because to the believer to a Christian forication is not is a noo area it's a no Zone and fornication imoral living is a no area the Bible says it should even be one time mentioned among you and he says if one be a pH don't even eat with him and he says he's not talking about everybody in the world because everybody in the world almost is a pH say case then we should not even live in the world he saying he's talking about those that are called by the name brother by the name sister and you are living in immorality you are having you are fornicating around the Bible says when we find out unless you repent and you change your ways we should not even fellowship with you we should not even eat with you because it is unclean living it takes away the glory of God from the church and then down here he says now if they burn well of course you are human be whether or not you're filled with the Holy Ghost your body will burn as long as you are still young and you are you are not old well of course if you're old like David you know they brought him I think was it abish and he could not even do anything the best he could receive was worms but we see here unto the mared I command yet not I but the Lord so here is the God's commandment let not the wife depart from her husband I know there are many issues in marriage and problems come up and issues come up and that's all understandable but here he says let not the wife depart from her husband it's not my words are you hearing me church it's the word of God sisters if you are married the Bible says turn never depart never go away why we need to teach about the approach of because many people want to divorce or to depart from their husbands they are those that approached the wrong way but you who are not yet married you have an opportunity this morning that we can we can teach you the right approach and when you hear it believe it and do it and God will give you a good marriage but and if she departs yeah he understands it may be difficult for you to stay especially if the husband is abusive for example even me as a pastor I cannot encourage you to stay with a man who is abusive if he's beating you up or psychologic torturing you and like that so God understands that and so Paul said and but if she depart let her remain [Music] un or be reconciled to her husband the only way a woman can Remar her first husband is dead and if your first husband is not dead you cannot remember Mar if you rem you are living in ad if you want to REM well you can REM your husband and let not the husband put away his wife the moment you marry you not going to say you go back your people you cannot do that you are married once and forever forever and ever amen even if you say when mared her she was looking beautiful she was Slender but now you know she been breastfeeding you know her breast is down now and even she's now B so now I cannot continue with that I'm not longer attracted to her I want to find another one no you should not divorce your wife she's your forever and ever [Applause] am are you hearing me don't even let those thoughts cross your mind praise the name of the Lord now we I've already answered you the question is why a man should marry why a woman also should get married but then he says I will make him and help me for him in Genesis 2:8 the Bible says now the Lord God say now this is the Amplified version it is not good meaning it is not sufficient it is not satisfactory that the man should be alone I will make him who makes for him who makes for him me chch who makes for the man God makes for the man I will make him don't worry about it sister amen God Made You for a don't worry about way knows him just pray believe and wait don't a brother God has made you a helpen if you not married and youing for a wife I want you to repeat after me my wife is somewhere God has made my wife one of these days going to see her it's a revelation and God says I will make him a meet me which means s aded compliment for sir not every woman is suitable or adopted to you are you hearing not everything I'm sorry to use that word that is called a woman that can be your wife your wife is a particular person are you hearing me now and I'm not talking about this kind of thing that you know we were you know known before no no what I'm saying according to our characters according to our ways we are raised is the way our brains function God knows you will choose for you someone that is suitable someone that is adapted to you know not everybody can be your husband there is one person and who knows that person only God knows that your mother doesn't know your father doesn't know your doesn't know but God knows that person that's why sometimes we may want someone to marry someone so bad but you know what God reveals to you who is suitable for you and we'll find out how you have to find the will of God on who she is it comes to you by Revelation and our Prophet say that faith is a revelation so in other words it comes to you by faith while you are praying ration and when Revelation stes who she is amen the will of God will not be known to you and the will of God can only be known in one way prayer it is not asking people how do you say that how do you see that how do you and people young people make this mistakes stop foolish things you can't find your wife like that one man is test is another one is another man so don't ask people to choose for you some people even come to me Pastor for me which one is better this one or this one you have a problem to begin with you have to find the will of God God is not an object God is God God is a person as in he has his own characteristics his behavior his character he speaks he hears amen he moves are you hearing me so if you believe in God you will ask God and God will answer God the first point I'm going into now we have now known why a man should not be alone some men desire to be alone you have a bad Revelation if you are alone is one of the reasons you are not completely sold to God you find some of these priests they deceived them they lie them and they tell them they should not get married and that if you don't get married You Are Holy that is not correct the Bible actually says those are doctrines of devils have you ever read it in the Bible in the book of Galatians he says those are do of devils people who forbid to marry and those who forbid people to eat some Meats he said those are teaching doctrines of devils can we read it now in the book of Galatians 3 I'm trying to open it here I have not prepared to read it these are very important principles for us to know and walk in them somebody chapter 3 oh first Timothy why was I thinking it is Galatians First Timothy chapter what chapter 4 okay verses yes God bless you told must be a preacher uhhuh listen now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times amen some shall depart from the faith how will they depart from the faith when they depart they will give he to seducing spirits and the doctrines of devils did you know the devil has doctrines and these people speak lies in hypocrisy having their consci seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry these are the doctrines of devils forbidden to do what to Mar even to today we have some very spiritual men of God when you tell them about marriage they will be negative they would be negative negative why because they think that to talk negative about marriages to be spiritual no no no no no no no those are doctrines of devils amen you have to talk positive about marriage because it is the will of God so those who forbid to marry they tell them you married to the church you are a brother you are n you are this and that those are doctrines of devil having their where he says and commanding to abstain from Meats which God has created to be received with Thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth so they even refuse people to eat meat they said don't eat pork because pork is cast but the Bible has say whoever says those things is teaching doctrines of devils because that was true in the Old Testament the Old Testament was the shadow of the new from the day the blood of Jesus was shed a New Covenant was introduced and under the New Covenant there is nothing Unholy everything can be eaten you can eat your pork and praise the Lord come on Church how many love FK here amen we can eat anything any meat as long as we prayed over it the Bible say is Sanctified by the word of God and pray so don't listen to those who forbid you to get married as long as you are of age all right so how do you approach PR uh marriage first prayer and the prophet of God was asked a question in in questions and answers how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord's will in some important [Music] matters what the best way find God's will in some important matters are you listening to me young people that's 10% of you are you listening 20% are you listening all right now listen he says this I had to do that because many times we preach this and they say we did not know now you have to know I tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of God some important matter is a prayer can you say Amen to that it is prayer if you have a matter that is very important is there any other matter apart from salvation that is important Mar no sure now here is the way I do it I take it before the Lord and it has always been my strength I wait upon the Lord I see what he says and I just let myself neutral you know you've not you've not made the choice yet but you are praying before you make the choice prayer happens before you make the choice not afterward and so you are neutral you don't know where to go you are praying oh God lead me God speak to me oh God guide me are you listening to me don't take either side and say now heavenly father because now in my case most of the time if it is very important I wait on a vision but many people God doesn't deal with Invision how many see Visions all right a few hands around now if everybody of you was waiting for a vision because said he was waiting for a vision let me pray until I see a vis no God doesn't deal with you that way are you following me now when you go to prayer you don't wait a brother to come and talk to you and then you go to pray you don't want to see a sister and then you go to pray I saw what you you had posted the other time brother Prince what was the name of the sister sister joy and this man was praying oh God give me sister Joy I Jo I die you don't pray like that you you your arm twisting God that is not a prayer that is last last is killing you and you're taking it before God go to prayer before you see sister Joy the prayer you pray after you see sister Joy is different okay follow me closely now because now in most times so many people I would advice for you to do that to wait on a vision because it's just some people that has visions and some does something else others they just get a revelation they see a dream others they just believe the word right others God may speak to you through a prophet God deals with people in different ways where you do something else that I couldn't do in your way of serving the lord I do something that you couldn't do so God deals with us different so I would if I was in your place and I didn't have visions from the Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now you show me what is the decision to make and then the way you feel led [Music] to wait just a little bit then wait a little bit and see which way which side you lean towards which way the spirit now father in my heart you know it doesn't matter which way you pray and you say but I want to know what you want to do about that's the way I do about meeting some sometimes when he's invited to meeting some places I feel kind of late to go this way or that way then I will follow this way that's the way to do it because the matter is in prayer then you are doing the best you can and I believe this my friend as Paul in the New Testament in the days going by he was between two straights which way he should go and he started on going the wrong road and he got a [Music] maian and and he turned back and if you are making a decision for God and do the best that you can I believe God listen to this I believe God will correct you and see that you do not go or do it wrong I believe God will do it are you following me young people prayer is the matter here marriage without prayer is not marriage pray and then listen pray and then wait pray and then see what God needs you to do praise the name of the Lord so now the question is how long do you pray it depends on who you are if you a man you pray until you receive Revelation if you a sister you pray and wait now the question is is it possible for you sister a desire of a kind of a man you want yes it is possible is it possible for God to speak to you about the kind of man you will marry yes it is possible but what do you do about it wait sister don't pray and after praying you come back and say and deons these young men moving out you have to make sure that they come back quickly because they going to miss have have please do your duty these things very important because these young people are the ones going to do mistakes so listen when you pray you don't pray sister and then you say I've seen him brother God has spoken God has told me the right one for me and the brother says but God never spoke no brother you the one the brother begins to go spoke to me it doesn't happen that way when God speaks to you about who is supposed to be your husband but for the man after you have prayed and you wait until you receive Revelation you don't start praying and after you see her you start well before you see anyone you put out a list of what you need and then ask the Bible say says ask and he shall receive you can put out a list I need a brother who has this I need is it possible yes it is possible you put out a list of the things you before God but you don't say to God it is this or nothing this is what I want but Lead Me To Your Way praise the name of the Lord whoever your wife or husband is is right here in you it is only you that has a vision of her it is only you that can know who she is and when God tells you who she is you will receive a revelation of who she is Sister you also receive a revelation God will speak to you don't take God out of this God is a part of this God is the major part of a marriage proposal Adam was by himself and God said it's not good for man to be aone I will make him a help and God put Adam to sleep and adamle andam and for as long as he was sleeping God was very busy working with his and by the time Adam W up Adam woke up out of his sleep his wife was right next to him and Adam opened his eyes Adam said you are born of my bnes here is a revelation who saw who first Eve must have seen Adam because Adam was sleeping while was aw waiting that's why I said to sisters don't wake up Brothers before they see you that's why I don't believe so that they see you things which they will not see you these days men are very rare that is not a spiritual speech that is the worldly speech cover yourselves up your own will see even if you're putting when BL your will come and when he comes will pass and he will see you hallelujah amen they TI and they they looking for men they don't look for men like that God Sons they don't look for a wife that is dressed like that but the sons of Kan will see and they will see you very fast and then you are saying I'm in a bad marriage how did you approach it if you attracted your man that's why he is like that how are you did you have a of God about you women that have a character of God will attract sons of God but if the character of the world is on you it will attract sons of K oh God Mery those are very strong words I know that's the reality and I'm speaking to you they un mared so sister don't you worry dress as a Christian live as a Christian you don't you don't have to you don't need to make your St they will see you sister God bless you [Music] so that they can see not the sons of God the sons of God when they see that what is this what is this and brother sister it may even be a good brother but when you qu guy and you wake him up wake up I always say this you may wake up a monster because you know when someone still has what happens when he Wes up until when Abraham was being oper God injected him and he waited wait woman wait wait for him to wake up it is the man to initiate a relationship not a woman your place is waiting and the brother when he wakes up I believe Eve smiled the woman smiled she knew he's about to see me know I know he's about to see and then when he saw when she saw him turning I know what he's going to say I know and then Adam opened his mou Eve was dying Joy say it Adam if it wasn't the way that God had did it the woman would have said it first let me tell you you don't have to force your lifetime part you Brothers what is wrong with youe woman take take all Spirit you are sting you are you are when the sister says I'm still praying leave her alone leave her alone if she says I'm not even sure I'm thinking about leave her leave her alone if she's yours she won't make you turn around to make things wrong there and there and there if she's yours if you tell her like this even you will know that she has accepted even if she doesn't say yes you will know she has accepted I've seen many brothers did the sister accept said yes you ask what did the sister say she said let me pray about it how did you know that know and at the end of the day you see they W because why you can read one another's when you see yourself forcing yourself stay away Adam did not for she already knew let me also say this many times women know before you know who your husband is before he talks to you I have many married sisters here who can attest to the my wife knew I was husband before I actually proposed she knew how did she know know but she told me she was praying and given Signs by the time I was just pushing somebody was it was not difficult at all Hallelujah and I can give more examples here I have an example of Ages here my where is Peter where is brother now you're sitting over this why don't you sit close you people should show these young people how they show you see the other side and are you fighting or what Sit Close to her with the children show amen the UN do you believe that yes now sistera here she knew ahead of time because she was living with us and you know these people see visions and Dre when I heard I said God will accomplish and and brother Peter came in my home he was having a guitar that is teaching guitar me I was already knowing what is going on and he was not living my home and he was teaching hold here hold but when I looked at his eyes I said there's something here I said Let Me Wait and after a while he spoke to her and then things happened there because you know he was you know still in school and you know things didn't work out for about one two years they were apart we went with Ethiopia and you know and when I called him are you people still interested in one another no no don't even talk about and I I talk to her are you interested don't even talk about said these people let just wait and see when we came back from ethopia to Uganda he came back in my house now Pastor I was saying what are you saying I was thinking about say it I wanted to resume I said you told me you don't like any no it was not the truth actually in my heart something what am I trying to say and these people end up getting married and they have made married well ever since I believe they have been complimenting they didn't say Amen Peter didn't say Amen but here is the point why the woman had already seen husband and the man no matter how far he would run he could not run out I feel to say this if you go in prayer and God chose you who your husband is believe for it pray for IT stand your ground don't tell anyone if you tell anybody you will spoil the whole thing God will say okay now there are some people who dream dreams and they want to make them happen they want to make the dreams happen this is what I saw it must happen if God showed it will bring it to he says write down the vision it may will surely come sister if God shows you your for it for him and wait upon God are you hearing me now and and and and sister Eve woman saw and waited and Adam came up and said you are BN of my B my woman just molded you know she just mended in that song Bor of my B Flesh of My you be called a woman Hallelujah and then just marage should not be difficult should be easy but you approach it the wrong way are you hearing me now don't approach it the wrong way approach it prayerfully brother if you want to get married don't begin looking around and shopping around and going from church to church go to the church and lo yourself in go some other place some room go some go begin praying oh God yes you going to Mar in two years no problem veeve to me open my eyes show me my me you praying people are saying what is wrong are you going to Mar this year no but I'm praying for my Mir to come I'm believing for it to happen it begins with prayer if you do not pray there are 99% chances you'll make a wrong [Music] mistake you will make a wrong choice and if you pray and you don't follow what God is telling you the chances are you will make a wrong all right that brings us to the second stage now how many have understood the prayer part pray and when you see her don't just go and grab her do it prayerfully also for it do it with cel now when it comes to courtship this is the major partner the many mistakes are done here in this area and I want to deal with it today we can help our young people now now there is no right or wrong way of starting [Music] courtship different pastors will tell you different approaches so in Zimbabwe they do it a little bit differently I I saw that some church they announce even courtship in the church no courtship not engagement courtship like I said different countries different churches different pastors have different approaches so it really basically comes down to your parents preference or your pastor's teach apprach it depends on the way that works for them as per their experience like every Church understand what I'm saying every church has their own experiences that things have examples of things that have happened in their Church decision on how matters should be handled you're following me right now but there are certain facts that we should know how the parents according to the Bible can annal your vow that's what the Bible teaches we'll get to that shortly H numbers 30 vers three let us first get that done if a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her Youth and her father hear her vow and her Bor wherewith she has bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every Bond wherewith she has bound her soul shall stand but if a father disallow her in the day that he heareth not any of her vows or her bones wherewith she has bound her soul shall stand and the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed [Music] her [Music] fore so now your your father has a very big authority over you so and um if your father does have such Authority how much more your spiritual on Earth your father your pastor how much more they have a lot of authority over you the Bible says here if the girl is still living in her father's house basically means under her father's um you know umbrella or or you know stewardship and the girl makes a vow any vow including a marriage vow then the the the if the father hears of it and he doesn't say anything it's all right the girl will be bound to that but if the father hears of it and he disallows it then the girl will be free from all so when you go and you talk to a sister and her father is not aware her pastor is not a and she you know engages with you like that the father has a right to say you will not marry my daughter you not Mar and by law you cannot actually marry her if her father dis so then what's the approach to court first of all courtship is not dating people tell each other is not courtship is not dating dating and courtship is like the same thing but dating is used in in a secular way it's the same thing is called but in the world when you are dating somebody you can go and visit their house right and spend a few nights or a few months and then you go back home or at the hostel where you are staying and you know he's buying you Pizza he's buying you this you meet everywhere you want to go whatever and you're waiting for the day he propos right so you live imally and after a long time the young man goes to somebody else deceived me he did this to me he did that to me that's the way of the world and we do not believe in dating like that we believe in cour a with the intention of [Music] marriage we don't believe in how is it called [Music] chatting is it also called slaying on the phone how is it called flatting flatting how many understand flatting you all looking at me as if you don't know I'm talking about may God forgive you flatting on the phone I love you you dare not say that to someone's daughter don't use such words someone you're not going to get married to I love you you don't know what the moment brother the moment say that s energy to this girl's house and she feels she's your property and now you come and say I'm not and those are the mistakes that have been done and we want we don't want those things to continue don't flat on phone that's why I don't believe that you have no business getting in touch you have no business getting in touch and I believe every parent has a right to know who your children are speaking [Music] to mothers fathers are you hearing well if your children are still young just know it from today you have a right to know who is your daughter speaking to because you're not going to go legalist way no phones well then if you say no phon you should get a phone get to know who is she talking to Hallelujah and all my children including the big boys they know this very well I search their phones who are you talking to even the big man like brother have taken his phone who who is that one I do it as long as I'm you're like parent I will do it as long as you are in my roof under my roof under my responsibility I will do it are you hearing parents you ought to do that get to know who they are talking well then you can be able to guide them now courtship is a time that a girl and a boy get to know each other this is the time the two families get born this is all approached advisably and in the fear of God all right so now that's why I said it's not this kind of of chitchat and they fling around your parents don't know that her parents don't doesn't know youres know so what is it that you're doing she's my friend he's my friend no I don't believe in that kind of friend I believe if someone is your friend they friend for a reason they are your friend because you're doing business with them they your friend now we have these groups some of you are sisters managing this group and you sending messages to Brothers brothers are sending to sisters that's all it is about like these sisters where is the sister Fe and other sisters who who were receiving people we are not saying oh cover your we put sisters to receive brothers sisters as well but these sisters got a lot of issues there a brother arrives and smiling they told him you should smile brother you're welcome now by the time the brother sister smiled very well comes back again sister can I have your cont can I can I can I can I but because the sister is trained well no I'm sorry I don't care my contact for what reason do you give maybe let me give the brother the contact because maybe he wants me to you have already finished your work you have already finished your work don't need to give the cont and here you know you are doing the group things and then you write a brother brother have you sent your your weekly contribution oh yes I have okay okay sister God bless you amen how are you fine oh sister I like your eyes you should be able to design there is a wrong Spirit here and if you have a spirit of Jesus Christ it is not hard to design these things number one goship now you see the god brother you see the God no one sees the God after you see the god you're not 100% sure I've heard something oh you 100% sure that's when you go to the pastor not sure the matter is still in prayer you need Cel come to the pastor I've been seeing this first question I will ask you have you contacted her be honest if you have be honest about I've seen young people who come no nothing and this have been talking for three four months the moment that happens be rest assured all the I'm going to give you is now unid it will not help you because you it's best on a life if you go to a doctor and you tell him doctor I I have a problem what's the problem my problem is ABC you do not tell the whole truth thect will not diagn you you have to say the truth you have to be honest you have to be a real gentle the Bible says in Proverbs 15 without Cel purposes are disappointed so you see you need Cel the moment you see before you even talk to her go to your pastor meet him and then receive councel now as your as the councel you have received you will then initiate contact with the God praise the name of the Lord usually it depends on that's why I'm saying as per the coun because you there are many scenarios there are scenarios where you may want to first visit the parents or talk to the parents there are scenarios where you may just want to contact the car there are scenarios where you may have to go through somebody it depends there is no one siiz fit all so seek for councel if you don't seek for councel you're going to see a sister and then you will tell the brother friend of yours you know I like that sister and I she's your friend please go to it has happened many times and when this when he reaches there he will say brother sister God bless you he how can I tell talk about the brother sing No No but sister you have been looking at you for a while you don't know what is in another brother's heart on your many people have married like when they go talk on of other they end up talking about themselves by the time you brother what Happ what came the sister said she loves me but is the one who did [Music] everything so as the coun contact the and a decision remember is not yet met by this time you met the pastor you prayed about it you seen the GU maybe you have contacted the guy our decision is not yet made it's not it doesn't mean now you're going to marry this is godship you getting to know who the person is so it's not a m that you Mar you're just getting to know each other right and and many of these fail and others work out so that's why in this church I contined to insist it should be a secret affair at that stage I've actually spoken to the young man you like that system how many of you told no one people will be there you don't know what is going and then by the time you know are in the late stag because why reasons in many of these circumstances you find that this young lady she's talking to this brother let us say that this brother has come to the pastor but this sister is liking this brother but this brother is not yet earning good money and then while the sister is talking to this brother brother comes brother is looking to the sister brother driving a very beauti and also talk to the without going through the pister putting his and now the sister begins going to accept Brother D but brother Dan has no money now brother is oh God help me then she also goes to her friends I have two boyfriend help me one is another is poor but he's very good no money what can I and then the sister the friends also ad jealous because they want the other brother understand IDE they will all have double standards that's why I said this The Secret of sisters don't accept a brother to cour you if they don't have the license he comes this you find one sister having 10 contacts Brothers this one I'm not sure this one has some money this one has this one is from my rich family this one is very spiritual this one has everything but it's not spiritual this one now the sister is there she comes in church you think you are worshiping but she's looking at everyone brother brother around for the Lord you know have this song we usually sing you know is all over me she's doing that and she's imagining that you can't even understand the sister is not in charge she's on on the market and trying to see who is the best suit so sisters Avo such things and you end up making wrong decisions they end up you know being broken in their hearts Gody don't accept applications that have not come the right way my daughters are you hearing amen don't accept them this is order from above don't accept applications not come the right way someone comes to you have you seen my P if they said no you also close your CH yes I know what I'm talking I know what we have experienced here if they say yes I've talked to don't take him for his word the moment they tell you yes also contact me meet me after service this brother and he said he talk to you are you yes I'm a okay what do you say about the brother I tell you my opinion of the brother I leave the decision to you you can go ahead usually I will give you a timeline someone was asking me how long then will you call well it depends some one month other two other three but I don't really think it should go beyond three or four months without a decision the longer you fellow long you born and if you've been long together time will come when you think you a husband and you even start behaving as one and when you don't when it doesn't work out then you will be all over the place everybody knew so and so they and there are some people in church who are very good at knowing they know the other one is talking to the other one the other one is talking other they will know you will ask them they will tell you every see those people they are very good at knowing they very good at causing confusion they pop their nose in people's Affairs don't be one of them you should mind your business who cares who is dating who I am minding my business I am here and I'm making my salvation with fear and trembling gets married so I also want to marry and I will marry my wife not his wife ifting the girl I wanted if she's meant to be will not work out have that attitude and I usually have give them a Time depending on the couple and the circumstances give them a timeline make a decision this given much perod of time and uh and after which if a decision has not been made and you are not too sure about each other it's just better you cut off the relation praise the Lord so that other brothers can also take their chances no need to advertise you are talking with a brother or sister in case it doesn't work out you actually end up suffering shame you understand you go all over the place because you want them to know how big you are that you can even C Sister Sister peace I'm talking I'm actually I'm ining to you see the pictures young people do you know why they do this they do this as a way to deter other young people from going there they're anxious may go there and if he talk to sister may go so anxious so I have to go so that he will watch out no need to if everybody no let them go if the sister receives them that she's of a bad character also especially after hearing this teach she will not receive them and even if she receives them and they end up Maring she was not meant for you brother relax and calm down your will come the right time so don't need to be anxious ading everywhere if it doesn't work out you will suffer the shame praise the name of the Lord so at that stage keep it a secret don't tell it don't tell it here it leave it as a and some of you have come oh brother they announced you in church and I was your friend come you didn't tell me I will not even come to your wedding i w even support you what is wrong with you it's their relationship their marriage if you love them support them if they told you what would you have done nothing you not we you were not needed at that time are you hearing me now goship ends in a decision ends in a choice courtship is the big deal here and I want to deal with it then I'll just finish the others so now courtship after I've showed you now how you approach it you know parents are involved pastors are involv you know and you two are involved you begin talking to one another you begin talking to one another and and if it works out praise the Lord then it must end in a decision choice and here is what a prophet says in the message the CH of please listen carefully so you must make the right choice again the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his Ambitions and his character say Amen the woman you choose she will reflect your ambition if you're a bad man you will choose a bad woman if you're a good man you cannot choose a bad woman because it is your character that will choose her if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to it shows truly what is in him a woman reflects what is in the man when he chooses half a wife shows what is down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he [Applause] Mar no matter what I come here and say matter what I preach look at my wife you will know what kind of a man I am if my wife doesn't come to church if my wife doesn't pray if my wife doesn't raise the children sheing he it shows what kind of man I am no matter what I say so the man chooses a woman that is a reflection of his character I got to a man's office and he says he's a Christian all around the world that old boyie music going on I don't care what he say I don't believe his testimony because his spirit is feeding on them things what say if you would marry a chorus girl or if you would marry a sex it reflects it shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be because he taken this woman to raise his children back the woman you choose will raise your children according to her character if you want a prayerful family choose a prayerful gu don't say I will change her later there's a problem there she cannot change later the way you choose her is the way she will remain she's not filled the Holy Ghost she won't have the Holy Ghost and she won't have anything to impact upon your children you see it reflects he shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be because you've taken that woman to raise children by of all of us what we are is our mother's responsibility our mother's duty how many can say 100% that's corre you are what you are because of your mother thank God for my mother right here I remember vividly from the time I was a baby I think when I remember maybe five six years I remember everything how she used to pray sometimes you playing in house and then you bump into a bedroom and you find down on her knees praying praying and she was even Anglican praying praying so that was raising us until we would find out praying and then you humble yourself also until you get tired and sneak away because you you are learning now she doesn't teach her children by what she knows she teaches your children by what she is if her mouth is filthy the mouth of your children will be filthy if she dresses well her children will dress well you see these girls dressing skimpy SC us watch their parents their mothers they doing the same same things so the woman you choose brother her character will reflect in your children so if you want a God-fearing family a spiritual woman and whatever she is that's the way she will raise those children it reflects what is in the man a man takes a woman like that he CHS just what he's thinking of the future okay let me finish up this listen could you imagine a Christian doing a thing like that no sir I could not a true Christian will not look for such beauty queens seens Look for Christian now you can't have all things there might be one God really pretty the other girl maybe she's her St looks better than this one and you might have to sacrifice one for the other you hearing me but if she's not the St of a lady or a woman if she's not the St of a woman or yeah he says I don't care whether she's pretty or not you better look at her character whether she's pretty or not pretty you may be looking for Slender the one who can model you already imagining how you're going to live you are just imagining it's not true don't be selfish when you choose a wife you not choosing a wife you're choosing a mother to your children you're very busy thinking when I choose this one I can even but now when I choose this how can I car her I will not that you have a problemer that's not what it should Bas on Bas on Christian character let me put this look for character it doesn't matter she may be 200 kg choose character if she can raise your children and bring a generation now it is becoming if a Christian would choose a wife he ought to choose a genuine Born Again woman regardless of what she looks like I don't need this very big cheeks may God have mercy on you are your cheeks small if I choose I need a long nose this nose is like it is very flat you think the nose will take you to heaven Hallelujah regardless of what she looks like it is what she is God help me you understand it if you understand it I will finish what makes her and then again that reflects his own Godly character and reflect what is in his mind what is going to be in the future for his family will be raised by such a woman for the future plans of his home if he marries one of these little sex queens and what what kind of a home could a man expect to have if he marries a girl that ain't got enough moral about her to stay home and take care of a house and want to work out in somebody's office what kind of a housekeeper would she be you will have babysitters and everything else and the prophet says now I am not much of this modernistic test women working when I seen these women with these Uniforms on riding around in the city motorcycles as police it is a disgrace C that let a woman do that to say Amen to this as many men without work it shows the modern thinking of our city show degrading we don't have them women we don't have to have them women out like that they ain't got no business out they like that when God gave a man a wife he gave him the best thing he could give outside ofation but when a woman goes to take A Woman's Place she about the worst thing I could ever get a hold of now Pastor are you saying women should not work our sisters here work we believe women should work and uh but what what the prophet is trying to say here is actually what we see actually this was 19 665 but it has gone even much worse you find women that say they have a career they're career minded they don't care about their family they care about their career to the extent many of them have convinced themselves they are um what is this kind of thing they they they are equal to man what is this called somebody help me throw the word to me feminine are they called feminine feminists the word feminist they believe everything a man can do I can do everywhere a man can work I can work I am equal to a should recognize me I am strong and not weak like that whereby they have taken their position taken it away from the world I am not here to preach to you what you want to hear I'm preaching to you what the word of God says and whether you don't like you like it you don't like the word of God never grows old same from AG to age societies will change will change but the word of God never changes and a place in a home is for the woman to take care of her family and raise the children in the fear of the Lord well where has help her husband as as your husband agrees you can go and work and help but where your husband doesn't agree for you to go and work well then he must be able to provide for everyone of for the Bible says if a man can't take care of his home worse than an INF help us a man must be able to work and take care of his home cherish his wife provide for his wife that's what the Bible says and that is the way of a choice has to be made in some other place it says a decision must be made you have to make a decision sister even you sister you must make a decision whether you want to go with this or not if you make a wrong decision knowing it is wrong then it's not up to God it's up to you you will have a wrong comp companion the rest of your life and there's nothing anybody can do about it the word of God does not allow you to Remar so then you must make your decision soberly spiritually prayerfully advisably waiting upon God and then you make the choice and when you make the choice she's the one sister you also have a choice you make your choice will you go if yes it is sealed that will bring us to the third stage now engagement and I'm not going to delay on this read a little portion for you and then after decision is made that you are then comes the engagement that you find at [Music] Al you've got to make an engagement before this Union can be and you see that's what we always do here they've really accepted a decision has been made she has already said yes so we come here in the church to make an official engagement by the time we announce it here not turning back and and he said it's um a pled and engagement A Love Affair and in questions aners 1964 says as long as they take that vow they are mared just like a boy if a boy promises a girl to marry her under good faith he's obligated to that gu he's just as good as mared the only thing that the Lord does the Lord does is to give you a bill of right to live together to keep from being common husband and wife but when a man tells a woman I will marry honey I'll marry I'll take you for my wife you had you had the words that shame was speaking when you get to those words you married your V is sacred that's what marries you and there is not a preacher can marry you no magistrate or nothing else it is your own vow to God and to this man when you promise when you promise you are married now if shame comes up or favor comes up now and say we've changed our mind well I just tell them suit yourselves as far as I'm concerned your marri and by the time we announce the engagement as this church we decided after past experiences will no longer announce engagements before getting the is approv and how do we do that traditionally here there is what we call a previsit and when that is done of course when the choices are made decisions are made after period of two months three months you've met that time of C you know one another what are you talking during that time really to know one another what are your priorities in life what are my priorities are they compatible what about your family what about my family are we compatible you know your brothers your sisters are we compatible can we make a home in this atmosphere if it is a yes then now you go to do a previsit when you do a the parents approve it's like the the parents have said you can now call you can we officially recognize you many times they tell us here in Africa well you can go and bring us this match then you will Mar our after that you can come here publicly announce your [Music] engagement pending the finishing of your maress which then comes the introduction and then the ceremony the ceremony doesn't have to be huge we have this mentality marriage is marriage needs money Mar does not need money marriage needs a man with a life of purpose number two who income B income that can take care himself and the wife and that's all it takes as you right in God that's all you need the rest you work it together you work for it together two are better than one she doesn't come to live in a be environment she comes to help you build your environment are you are you F me church that's what marriage is you come together to build when I when I got married with my wife we literally had people who but where are they today but God has given us Grace actually yesterday we were celebrating our first daughter's 10th birthday but the the great talkers who talked against we can't even find them any but we are still here so don't listen to the people who are talking many of them who are talking they're talking because they're coming from defeated scenarios in the past faed marriages faed relationship there's a woman I heard [Music] say men are beast don't follow such words words come from broken hearts are not don't follow such words follow the word of God the word of God says if you find a wife good you favor from the Lord I'm glad shame found favor and when he got favor from the Lord he got favor and then after and then lastly comes the wedding this is where the promises are made the promises here is where you make promises to one another actually someone told me where do those promises come well you can write your own and tell me Pastor these are the promises no problem as long as they agree with the word then you will we will give those promises and you know it says that those promises have to be made to one another like that you make the promise sweetheart if you marry me I promise that I'll be loyal and true I I will look upon no other woman I look upon no other man that as a duty as a wife children I will do as a duty as a mother housekeeper all these promises has to be man should be made in a correct way now when you make these promises it doesn't have to be in a big wedding it can be five people can be 10 according to your income and your available resources we are not going to stress our young people you don't have to make a big wedding if brother Dan is going to make a wedding and and he invites his friends people don't kill him brother you are very if you give him the money he will make the one for 100 but if he if you have no money you can even come here like this on Su and you and you go back home no stress no stress so these things are supposed to be done that way and that's the approach to now all young people with questions I've done my best in one hour and a half I request you to write them downend to me as the musicians come I'll be dealing with the questions later on but I trust this has been a blessing Amen Let Us stand on our feet God bless you for being a good good audience and listening I know you've listened and learned we have different Services we always
