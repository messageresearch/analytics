[1:16:55] Release the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:56] Christ
[1:16:58] and cleanse each and every soul Lord.
[1:17:02] May the blood of Jesus stand between us
[1:17:04] and our sins.
[1:17:06] That when you look in our midst this
[1:17:08] morning, he will see us through the
[1:17:10] blood. Lord,
[1:17:12] may the great Holy Spirit move.
[1:17:16] May you take the full preeminence.
[1:17:19] Come and glorify your word, Lord. Take
[1:17:22] me out of the way and come and speak to
[1:17:26] your bride.
[1:17:28] Father, cleanse my lips, Lord Jesus.
[1:17:31] You sanctify the congregation.
[1:17:35] You told Moses to gather the people.
[1:17:38] Speak to the rock and the rock will give
[1:17:41] of
[1:17:43] you. We have come this morning Lord.
[1:17:45] Speak to the Lord. Lord,
[1:17:48] come and speak to us.
[1:17:51] Father, make us a better Christian.
[1:17:54] Renew our life today.
[1:17:57] Speak to our inner man.
[1:17:59] Father, may you anoint my interpretive
[1:18:01] brother
[1:18:03] and each and every soul this morning.
[1:18:06] Take charge of every evil spirit.
[1:18:09] Satan, we render you powerless.
[1:18:12] We rebuke you in the name of Jes
[1:18:22] Lord Jesus.
[1:18:23] May you touch them from the crown of
[1:18:25] their head,
[1:18:27] the soul of their feet.
[1:18:30] In the most precious name of the Lord,
[1:18:32] we commit the word at your hands. Bless
[1:18:35] your reading of the word.
[1:18:38] And may the Holy Spirit come and give us
[1:18:40] inspiration
[1:18:42] in Christ Jesus name.
[1:18:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you this morning.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. You give me a better
[1:18:54] voice. I feel I'm straining a lot.
[1:18:58] Yeah, I welcome this morning the praise
[1:19:00] of the Lord.
[1:19:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Is everyone fine?
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I trust everyone is okay.
[1:19:19] I want us to go straight to the reading
[1:19:21] of the word.
[1:19:23] You pray for me this morning that the
[1:19:24] Lord will use me to speak to you.
[1:19:28] I know it is quite some time I taken
[1:19:31] some more time
[1:19:34] but the Lord knew that I would stand
[1:19:35] here this morning.
[1:19:39] Amen. Our pastor is not with us.
[1:19:43] Uh we know where he is.
[1:19:46] Shall we turn to Deuteronomy chapter
[1:19:47] one?
[1:19:52] We're reading from uh
[1:19:55] vers 18.
[1:20:21] And I commanded you at the time all
[1:20:25] things which you should do. And when we
[1:20:28] depart from Horeb, we went through all
[1:20:31] that great and terrible wilderness,
[1:20:34] which you saw by the way of the mountain
[1:20:36] of Amorite, as the Lord our God
[1:20:39] commanded us. And we come uh and and we
[1:20:44] came to Kadeshban. And I said unto you,
[1:20:47] you uh unto you, come, you are come unto
[1:20:52] the mountain of Amorite, which the Lord
[1:20:54] our God doth give unto us. Behold the uh
[1:20:59] behold the Lord thy God hath set the
[1:21:02] land before thee. Go up and possess it,
[1:21:05] as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said
[1:21:08] unto thee, Fear not, neither be
[1:21:11] discouraged. And you and ye came near
[1:21:14] unto unto me, everyone of you, and said,
[1:21:19] We will send men before us, and they
[1:21:22] shall search
[1:21:24] us. There shall search us out of uh out
[1:21:27] of the land and bring us word again. By
[1:21:32] which by what way we must go up and into
[1:21:38] what city we shall come.
[1:21:48] for
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:17] Fore!
[1:22:39] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:22:42] [Music]
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:23:10] Amen.
[1:23:12] Precious Lord,
[1:23:14] we thank you for the reading of the
[1:23:16] word.
[1:23:18] We ask you that you add your blessings
[1:23:20] upon it
[1:23:22] in Jesus name.
[1:23:25] Amen. Amen. You may take your seats.
[1:23:40] Yeah, this morning
[1:23:42] I have something that I want us to
[1:23:44] share.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And I will call my title this morning.
[1:23:51] There is a land.
[1:23:54] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:23:57] Tell your neighbor there is a land.
[1:24:01] Praise the Lord. And where we have read
[1:24:04] in Deuteronomy,
[1:24:06] we are seeing uh we know the journey of
[1:24:09] Israelites
[1:24:12] from the bondage from the land of
[1:24:14] bondage
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:16] to the promised land.
[1:24:19] Praise the Lord. The prophet tells us
[1:24:22] that when they were in Egypt,
[1:24:25] they were the people of God.
[1:24:28] Amen. But when God sent them the
[1:24:30] liberator,
[1:24:33] to bring them out of that land.
[1:24:36] And when there went to the promised
[1:24:38] land,
[1:24:41] they became the church of God.
[1:24:45] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[1:24:48] this morning, I have something that I
[1:24:50] want us to share.
[1:24:53] Uh and we are calling it there is a
[1:24:56] land.
[1:25:00] Praise be to God.
[1:25:02] How many believe there is a land?
[1:25:06] We are spiritual Israelites,
[1:25:09] physical Israelites.
[1:25:11] They had the land which God had promised
[1:25:14] to them. God promised their father
[1:25:17] Abraham
[1:25:19] that he would give them that land
[1:25:22] and time came for them to leave Egypt
[1:25:28] and go to that land.
[1:25:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord. We are
[1:25:33] in another exodus
[1:25:35] and this is called the third exodus.
[1:25:38] Praise be to God. Every time there's an
[1:25:41] exodus,
[1:25:43] there is something God is fixing to
[1:25:48] say every time when God moves
[1:25:52] it means something.
[1:25:54] Whenever God moves, there's something
[1:25:57] fixing to happen.
[1:26:00] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:26:03] Amen. And this morning, I want us to
[1:26:06] move as God is moving.
[1:26:10] Praise be to God. And here where we have
[1:26:13] read in Deuteronomy,
[1:26:15] we are seeing God telling them of the
[1:26:17] land.
[1:26:19] But I want us also to read in Joshua
[1:26:21] chapter one
[1:26:23] where God spoke to Joshua
[1:26:27] and told him. Joshua chapter one say
[1:26:29] that now after the death of Moses
[1:26:33] the servant of the Lord. It came to pass
[1:26:36] that the Lord spake unto Joshua
[1:26:39] the son of Non Moses my minister
[1:26:45] saying Moses my servant is dead
[1:26:49] now therefore
[1:26:51] arise go over this Jordan
[1:26:56] thou an older people
[1:26:59] and to the land which I do give to them.
[1:27:03] Amen. even the children of Israel.
[1:27:08] Every step that the soul of your foot
[1:27:11] shall troll
[1:27:13] upon
[1:27:15] that have I given unto you.
[1:27:18] And as I said unto Moses,
[1:27:21] from the wilderness
[1:27:23] and this Lebanon, even to the great
[1:27:26] river Ephes,
[1:27:29] all the land of the Hittite,
[1:27:31] and unto the great sea,
[1:27:34] toward the going down of the sun
[1:27:37] shall be your cause.
[1:27:40] There shall not any man
[1:27:44] be able to stand before thee
[1:27:47] all the days of thy life.
[1:27:50] As I was with Moses,
[1:27:52] so I will be with thee.
[1:27:55] I will not fail thee,
[1:27:58] nor forsake thee.
[1:28:00] Blessed be the name of the Lord. God was
[1:28:03] telling them of a land
[1:28:06] where they had never been there before.
[1:28:10] Praise be to God. And God was
[1:28:12] instructing them. God sent them a
[1:28:15] prophet
[1:28:17] to lead them to that land because they
[1:28:20] did not know the land.
[1:28:23] God knew that land.
[1:28:25] Amen. But still them being human,
[1:28:31] when they reached Jordan,
[1:28:33] God commanded Joshua
[1:28:35] to choose amongst them every tribe,
[1:28:41] one person, one man to go and spy them.
[1:28:47] Blessed be the name of God. Praise be to
[1:28:50] God. God knows that we are human being.
[1:28:54] There are some things which are very
[1:28:56] hard for us
[1:28:58] to believe. So we'll always make a way.
[1:29:03] That's why in every generation
[1:29:06] God sends a prophet
[1:29:09] because the word of God comes to the
[1:29:11] prophet.
[1:29:14] Amen. And the prophet sees
[1:29:18] deep in the mind of God
[1:29:21] and comes and tells us that indeed there
[1:29:25] is a land.
[1:29:27] Praise be to God.
[1:29:29] Amen. That's why God chose told Joshua
[1:29:34] to choose one man
[1:29:37] amongst every tribe. Those were 12 men.
[1:29:42] Go and spy the land.
[1:29:44] And as if that was not enough,
[1:29:47] when they went by the land,
[1:29:50] they came with evidence.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Still for the lady,
[1:29:58] still for the congregation,
[1:30:01] not only to hear the what the spies say,
[1:30:06] but to see the evidence
[1:30:11] that the land is real.
[1:30:14] It flows milk and honey.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. This
[1:30:20] man came with a uh with a report.
[1:30:24] They came with a fruit.
[1:30:27] Amen. That was enough evidence,
[1:30:31] their
[1:30:33] words
[1:30:35] meant nothing.
[1:30:37] Their evidence,
[1:30:40] it was the most important thing. Not
[1:30:42] what they are saying. Okay. You are
[1:30:45] saying the land is there.
[1:30:47] They are anx
[1:30:50] evidence.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That was the proof.
[1:30:59] Amen.
[1:31:01] And remember this was physical Israel.
[1:31:04] But even the spiritual Israel,
[1:31:07] we have a land to possess. And I'm here
[1:31:10] to tell you that there is a land.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; The land is real.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Says
[1:31:24] in the message what shall we do with G
[1:31:26] uh sorry in the proving his word.
[1:31:30] He says that see they see they will have
[1:31:33] the evidence that God said it is good
[1:31:36] land.
[1:31:41] and it and it is filled with milk and
[1:31:44] honey.
[1:31:46] It's a it's a it's a grand land.
[1:31:51] It's a good land.
[1:31:53] Now you all all the old uh old garlic
[1:31:57] leak and whatever you got here in Egypt.
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:04] Now we are taking you to a land
[1:32:07] with milk and honey.
[1:32:10] You probably never tasted either one
[1:32:12] milk or honey
[1:32:17] down there in Egypt.
[1:32:20] And all these years,
[1:32:24] praise be to God. They just give you the
[1:32:27] slaves uh riot rioting
[1:32:33] but now you are going to this land
[1:32:36] just at the time they got in about one
[1:32:39] day's journey.
[1:32:46] Blessed be the name of the
[1:32:49] praise the Lord. You know when God say
[1:32:52] there is a land,
[1:32:54] God means it. He meant it.
[1:32:58] Amen. When God told us that there is
[1:33:01] rapture,
[1:33:03] brother, rapture is coming.
[1:33:06] Amen. We know that rapture is in
[1:33:11] the message of our day when we still out
[1:33:14] there. We thought that will just happen
[1:33:17] after.
[1:33:19] But we are glad that through the uh by
[1:33:21] the eyes of the prophet,
[1:33:24] amen, he breaks us these things down.
[1:33:29] We know that it moves in stages.
[1:33:33] Blessed be the name of the Lord and you
[1:33:35] are very sure that you already in that
[1:33:39] process.
[1:33:41] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:33:45] So we have a land to possess.
[1:33:48] And Jesus himself
[1:33:51] said, "I'm going to prepare a place
[1:33:55] and where I am, there you will also be.
[1:33:59] I will come.
[1:34:01] I
[1:34:03] praise the Lord." Jesus our Joshua,
[1:34:07] the Holy Ghost. He went to spy the Lord.
[1:34:12] And he died on the cross.
[1:34:14] Praise be to God. He went to hell and
[1:34:18] conquered hell. And from there he went
[1:34:22] to heaven and he came down in the form
[1:34:26] of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:28] with a proof
[1:34:31] with an evidence
[1:34:34] that this land I'm talking about
[1:34:37] is real.
[1:34:39] Blessed be the name.
[1:34:42] Amen. Amen. That makes us to know
[1:34:45] where we are, where we are standing,
[1:34:49] what we believe, and where we are going.
[1:34:53] Amen. Because in our DNA,
[1:34:58] in God's DNA,
[1:35:01] in his DNA,
[1:35:03] we were the foundation of God.
[1:35:06] And that blood line
[1:35:09] flowing through us.
[1:35:12] Praise be to God. Amen. And God knew
[1:35:15] very well
[1:35:17] Joshua and
[1:35:20] they are not going to be undisputed.
[1:35:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:27] Amen. I'm glad to know
[1:35:31] and I believe that I'm in God's DNA.
[1:35:36] And that's why many things have come our
[1:35:39] way.
[1:35:40] We have been beaten down and up. We have
[1:35:44] been tried and shaken.
[1:35:47] Amen. But we have not given up. We are
[1:35:51] still moving on. And we are not here to
[1:35:54] give up. Every time we come to church,
[1:35:58] we are coming to tell the devil, we are
[1:36:00] not giving up.
[1:36:03] It is not yet over.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:36:08] Amen. When you are down in the spirit
[1:36:13] and then you come to church
[1:36:15] sometime even myself,
[1:36:18] there's a point where you just have to
[1:36:20] force yourself down.
[1:36:23] Amen. The devil will give you 100
[1:36:26] reasons
[1:36:28] of not coming to church.
[1:36:32] You see you are tired.
[1:36:34] You see you are weak. You even have
[1:36:36] headache.
[1:36:38] What if you collapse on the way?
[1:36:42] You don't even have transport. Maybe
[1:36:43] sometime
[1:36:45] now you're going to sacrifice that.
[1:36:50] Will you eat the word?
[1:36:53] You are even hungry.
[1:36:56] And indeed when you are hungry
[1:36:59] and you will not play that tongue like
[1:37:00] 100 times
[1:37:03] and you be joining like after now.
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:12] Praise be to God.
[1:37:15] But every time I remember
[1:37:18] that there is a land
[1:37:20] beyond the river.
[1:37:22] That is what matters.
[1:37:26] Amen. Amen. I have the evidence
[1:37:30] because I received the Holy Ghost. That
[1:37:33] is the harness of my salvation.
[1:37:37] Praise be to God. And that is what keeps
[1:37:41] us moving.
[1:37:44] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:37:47] God knew that they would not believe
[1:37:48] their report.
[1:37:52] So he told he told Joshua
[1:37:54] take the evidence.
[1:37:57] Yes sir. When they see those evidence
[1:38:01] somehow they will believe.
[1:38:04] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:38:08] Sometime even when you don't want to
[1:38:10] believe
[1:38:12] there is something in your heart
[1:38:15] to tell you this is the word of God.
[1:38:20] Amen. You are familiar with it.
[1:38:24] Amen. Because that is the language
[1:38:28] which we spoke before the foundation.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:37] Amen. Joshua knew that the land was
[1:38:40] there.
[1:38:41] He went first and found out that that uh
[1:38:44] he found out that he could come back as
[1:38:47] a witness.
[1:38:51] Amen.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; He was a witness.
[1:38:56] He had an evidence
[1:38:58] and he was skunk sure
[1:39:02] that they are taking the land
[1:39:04] even in this gen.
[1:39:07] What is going to keep us moving?
[1:39:11] It is to know
[1:39:14] that we are on the right track
[1:39:18] and we are fighting the right battle
[1:39:21] and we are in the right place
[1:39:24] that there is a that heaven is real
[1:39:27] and hell is real.
[1:39:31] Not until you reach that point
[1:39:34] where you know that heaven is real
[1:39:38] and hell is real.
[1:39:41] You have not started.
[1:39:45] Blessed be the name of
[1:39:48] Amen. We must have a purpose.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; The land where we are going
[1:39:58] is a land is a different land.
[1:40:02] It's a spanial land.
[1:40:04] It's a spiritual land.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can only go there.
[1:40:10] by faith in God's word.
[1:40:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[1:40:18] because God knew that, that's why he has
[1:40:21] given us the portion of his spirit.
[1:40:25] That will always remind us
[1:40:28] the reason was as to why we are here on
[1:40:30] earth.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:38] When Joshua went there and came back
[1:40:41] with a report
[1:40:44] even today in the message of the hour,
[1:40:47] we have the 12.
[1:40:49] We have the 10 spies.
[1:40:52] They are there to discourage you.
[1:40:55] They are there to contend with the word,
[1:40:58] contend with a message.
[1:41:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:41:04] They're the one who will tell you
[1:41:07] thunder is not revealed.
[1:41:10] They're the one who will tell you this
[1:41:12] and that. Blessed be the name of God.
[1:41:16] Whose report are you taking?
[1:41:19] Praise be to God. Those are the men who
[1:41:23] have not even been there.
[1:41:27] Yes.
[1:41:28] Praise be to God.
[1:41:30] In fact, for them,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; they just believed the report,
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:43] but they never went there. Blessed be
[1:41:46] the name of the Lord.
[1:41:48] But we have a prophet who went there and
[1:41:52] came as a witness.
[1:41:55] He came with a report.
[1:41:57] He was the true witness.
[1:42:00] Praise be to God. Whose report are you
[1:42:03] believing?
[1:42:05] Hallelujah. Praise be to God.
[1:42:09] Is it for this man?
[1:42:12] Or you believing the prophet's report.
[1:42:17] Praise the Lord. He came and preached
[1:42:19] the message. the ficial home
[1:42:24] of the heavenly bride
[1:42:27] and the earth of the earthly bride and
[1:42:30] heaven bride.
[1:42:33] Blessed be the name of the lord Jesus.
[1:42:37] So even today we are going to have those
[1:42:40] uh people who will reason with the word.
[1:42:46] They are putting their theology in the
[1:42:47] word.
[1:42:49] They are explaining this and that.
[1:42:52] They want to prove how vindicated they
[1:42:54] are.
[1:42:56] For us, we know and we believe that the
[1:43:01] message is already vindicated.
[1:43:04] Praise be to God. And every time even
[1:43:07] when they are ministering,
[1:43:10] they want always people to take
[1:43:12] pictures.
[1:43:16] Then after
[1:43:19] You find them watching. Do you see that
[1:43:22] thing?
[1:43:25] Praise be to God.
[1:43:28] They want to prove that they are
[1:43:30] vindicated.
[1:43:32] The message is vindicated.
[1:43:35] We don't want any man's vindication.
[1:43:39] Praise be to God. Give us the message.
[1:43:43] That is all we need.
[1:43:46] It is the message telling us that there
[1:43:49] is a land.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Our prophet went there.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And he came back and
[1:43:57] told us that there is a land. And Jesus
[1:44:00] gave a promise. I will send you the Holy
[1:44:04] Ghost.
[1:44:05] Not another comforter,
[1:44:08] but the very one who is with you. When
[1:44:12] he will come.
[1:44:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I will never leave you comfortless,
[1:44:19] but I will send your comforter.
[1:44:21] The Holy Ghost when he comes.
[1:44:26] Amen. It is the Holy Ghost telling us
[1:44:30] about where we are.
[1:44:33] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:44:36] You know the blood of Jesus when it's
[1:44:39] only the blood of Jesus
[1:44:41] that separates
[1:44:43] the bride of Christ
[1:44:45] and the ordinary church member.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You'll find two people
[1:44:54] struggling.
[1:44:56] One is contending with the word.
[1:44:59] Another one is just believing.
[1:45:04] Praise be to God.
[1:45:06] But there are others
[1:45:08] you find them fasting.
[1:45:11] It can't be. It did not meant this
[1:45:16] before the creation.
[1:45:18] There were some being there.
[1:45:25] Praise be to God.
[1:45:27] There are men
[1:45:29] in this world.
[1:45:31] Every time they hold the Bible like
[1:45:34] this,
[1:45:36] You find them looking for mistakes.
[1:45:43] Give them the message.
[1:45:45] They claim to be message believers.
[1:45:50] There are those even who are in the
[1:45:51] message.
[1:45:53] Every time they hold a message book,
[1:45:56] they're looking for the prophet.
[1:46:03] They're looking for mistake.
[1:46:06] Those are the 10 spies.
[1:46:09] They are the 10 spies.
[1:46:12] Praise be to God. But those who are in
[1:46:15] God before the foundation of the world.
[1:46:20] Amen. You see, God allowed even science
[1:46:25] to break in his lap.
[1:46:28] Yeah, they can take a samp of your blood
[1:46:32] and they test your DNA.
[1:46:36] In fact, they can tracement up to your
[1:46:38] third grandfather.
[1:46:45] Praise be to God.
[1:46:49] And you and there is sometimes there's
[1:46:51] what they call the bad blood.
[1:46:55] Yes.
[1:47:00] the blood of those people.
[1:47:03] The third grandfather there
[1:47:07] was a very good night dancer.
[1:47:14] They can get the samp of your blood
[1:47:17] and they take it to the lab and they
[1:47:20] check
[1:47:22] and they can even discover some of the
[1:47:24] heart
[1:47:26] that your grandparents
[1:47:28] all the diseases your God allows that.
[1:47:34] Praise be to God.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; That is not just science.
[1:47:40] So when the Bible tells you that we were
[1:47:43] in God before the foundation of the
[1:47:46] world,
[1:47:48] why do you doubt that?
[1:47:53] Amen. Get a lab of faith.
[1:47:59] Amen. Take your blood
[1:48:02] by the word.
[1:48:04] Look at your character.
[1:48:07] Look at your likes. Look at things that
[1:48:09] attract to you. Amen. Then get the word.
[1:48:14] Compare and contrast.
[1:48:17] You will know that I was in God.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:33] Praise be to God. I'm here to tell you
[1:48:35] this morning that in your blood vein
[1:48:39] flows the royal blood.
[1:48:42] The same blood that flows from the vein
[1:48:44] of Emmanuel
[1:48:46] where sin has belonged.
[1:48:49] Amen. Praise be to God. That is the
[1:48:53] blood of God.
[1:48:56] And that is what tells you even when you
[1:48:59] are discouraged
[1:49:01] brother there is a land.
[1:49:04] There is a land.
[1:49:06] This time is not physical land.
[1:49:10] This time is not physical.
[1:49:13] Praise be to God. But inside your blood,
[1:49:18] deep in your heart,
[1:49:21] there is something telling you.
[1:49:26] So we look like them.
[1:49:29] We behave like we do. We work with them.
[1:49:34] But deep inside
[1:49:36] there is something
[1:49:38] that they cannot have. Hallelujah.
[1:49:42] Praise be to God.
[1:49:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; And that's what Abraham had.
[1:49:49] Old man of 80 years,
[1:49:53] 90 years, he's in the supermarket buying
[1:49:56] diaper,
[1:49:58] buying baby soul.
[1:50:01] So, father, grandpa Abraham,
[1:50:04] and do you have a son? You are buying
[1:50:06] for.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm buying for my son.
[1:50:11] Oh, but we know you don't have a child.
[1:50:14] It's now 90 years.
[1:50:16] It's 100 years.
[1:50:18] Yes. The Lord promised me
[1:50:21] and he gave me a child.
[1:50:24] Even his name is be called Isaac.
[1:50:27] Praise be to God. Maybe if Abraham was
[1:50:30] in this day,
[1:50:32] he would go to those who are doing
[1:50:34] embroidery.
[1:50:36] If you go to brother Emma,
[1:50:38] those who are doing graphic,
[1:50:40] I tell him, put the name Isaac on this
[1:50:44] plant.
[1:50:46] God is going to give my child.
[1:50:49] Praise be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:50:53] God's word cannot fail.
[1:50:57] When God promises,
[1:51:00] I don't care how long it will take.
[1:51:03] Praise be to God.
[1:51:05] Don't think that Joshua was not
[1:51:07] discouraged.
[1:51:11] Joshua was human being like you and I.
[1:51:15] Only the difference
[1:51:18] was that in Joshua
[1:51:21] he had something special.
[1:51:25] Amen.
[1:51:28] This man was there. People were dying
[1:51:32] because of unbelief.
[1:51:36] Maybe was there in the night they knock
[1:51:39] at his door. Neighbor is gone. Oh God,
[1:51:44] maybe immediate neighbor,
[1:51:46] my relative is gone.
[1:51:50] He might have been discouraged.
[1:51:54] Praise be to God because he's a man like
[1:51:57] you and me.
[1:51:59] Praise the Lord. He was not a superman.
[1:52:04] But he was a believer of the word.
[1:52:08] Praise the Lord. He knew that God who
[1:52:12] studied that good work.
[1:52:14] There's no way he can stop.
[1:52:18] Amen.
[1:52:20] There's no way Joshua went to the
[1:52:22] promised land.
[1:52:24] Came back with positive report.
[1:52:28] Still the congregation
[1:52:31] telling them
[1:52:33] We are more than able.
[1:52:36] He never looked at his age.
[1:52:39] He looked at the promise.
[1:52:42] He never looked at his neighbor.
[1:52:45] He looked at the promise.
[1:52:47] Praise be to God.
[1:52:50] Amen.
[1:52:52] This message all about me.
[1:52:55] It's not even about my wife or my
[1:52:58] neighbor or my children.
[1:53:02] high and high alone.
[1:53:05] That's how we supposed to take the word.
[1:53:08] That's how we supposed to take the word.
[1:53:13] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:53:15] Remember when it was revealed to Job.
[1:53:18] Job knew where what he was talking
[1:53:20] about.
[1:53:22] Even his wife
[1:53:24] tried discouraged.
[1:53:27] But inside job
[1:53:30] there is something
[1:53:32] There was something speaking to him.
[1:53:34] Amen. Job knew that God cannot just
[1:53:39] leave him.
[1:53:42] That's why David say, "I was young
[1:53:44] and now I'm old. I've never seen
[1:53:47] righteous person."
[1:53:50] Not his children or seed begging.
[1:53:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Our God is a
[1:53:57] rich God. He has everything we need.
[1:54:01] Amen. He's more than able to take us to
[1:54:05] the rapture.
[1:54:07] He would have not mentioned it. But
[1:54:10] because he know that he's more than
[1:54:12] able.
[1:54:14] Yes sir. And because when he saw us
[1:54:18] there
[1:54:20] praise be to God. Sometime I just think
[1:54:26] God there in glory.
[1:54:29] Maybe every evening
[1:54:32] because he used to visit Adam in the in
[1:54:33] the cool of the evening.
[1:54:37] He walks through the corridors of
[1:54:38] heaven.
[1:54:40] He comes to that to that great dining
[1:54:43] hall.
[1:54:48] Praise be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Angels are prepared.
[1:54:55] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Decoration is going on over there.
[1:55:04] Chairs are being worked on ground.
[1:55:07] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Precious stones of silver and gold
[1:55:13] rubies
[1:55:15] is being laid all over.
[1:55:18] Praise be to God. And maybe every
[1:55:21] evening
[1:55:23] God comes around
[1:55:29] like this
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; turn like this.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; The one who will miss heaven.
[1:55:44] You rather miss going for Independence
[1:55:46] Day
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; than missing heaven.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:55:56] We are not just comforting ourselves. We
[1:55:59] mean it.
[1:56:01] That's why we have forsaken everything.
[1:56:03] Hallelujah.
[1:56:06] Praise be to God.
[1:56:11] preparing
[1:56:16] every single day.
[1:56:18] That's why he has given us the blood
[1:56:20] that cannot expire
[1:56:24] until rapture.
[1:56:26] It will never expire.
[1:56:29] As long as the ransom church is here,
[1:56:34] Amen. Amen. It will never fall.
[1:56:39] I don't care how many time you fall.
[1:56:42] As long as you fall and rise,
[1:56:45] the blood is there.
[1:56:49] Every time the blood is boiling,
[1:56:54] go deep yourself in the blood because
[1:56:56] there is a land
[1:56:58] somewhere where we are going.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Praise be to God.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, he told them,
[1:57:14] you know, many time when you are
[1:57:15] preaching,
[1:57:17] maybe even outside or in here,
[1:57:21] then they ask you, but we want an
[1:57:24] evidence.
[1:57:28] Praise be to God. But on the day of
[1:57:31] Pentecost, when they were charged,
[1:57:35] 100% charge.
[1:57:38] Praise be to God. Then Peter preached
[1:57:42] without a microphone.
[1:57:46] But God amplified his voice,
[1:57:50] "Hallelujah." Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; And the congregation scream,
[1:57:54] "What shall we do
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; to have that?"
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:58:05] Peter told them, "You want evidence
[1:58:09] in the message question and answer.
[1:58:12] If you want evidence of it, repent
[1:58:17] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:58:19] Christ
[1:58:21] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:58:23] shall receive the gift,
[1:58:25] the Holy Ghost." That is the evidence
[1:58:29] that raised us up.
[1:58:32] He said I will give you the earnest of
[1:58:35] your inheritance.
[1:58:39] And what happened on the day of
[1:58:41] Pentecost?
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit came upon believer.
[1:58:46] God saw things.
[1:58:49] God saw things
[1:58:53] we were going to face. Oh, God. Oh,
[1:58:56] amen. God saw things we're going to face
[1:58:58] in the world.
[1:59:01] And he say let me give the earest of my
[1:59:04] spirit.
[1:59:10] There is nothing we face in this earth
[1:59:13] which you cannot overcome. Hallelujah.
[1:59:15] Praise be to God.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:17] In fact,
[1:59:20] God is children.
[1:59:22] They can never be defeated.
[1:59:26] Every time you lose,
[1:59:30] you lose
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; because
[1:59:34] you have accepted your opponent to win
[1:59:36] you.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:59:42] If you look at boxing matches
[1:59:48] like those who are popular
[1:59:52] sometime there is a tendency
[1:59:56] where they meet in the back at the back
[1:59:58] door.
[2:00:01] And then they say, "I'm going to give
[2:00:02] you this much."
[2:00:08] Yeah. You allow me to.
[2:00:12] I have to keep my standard. Let me give
[2:00:14] you some money so that
[2:00:19] now you fight.
[2:00:21] You You allow him
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; to beat you. the the the punch that will
[2:00:26] put you down.
[2:00:28] Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; When they beat you that that you can
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; when they give you KO
[2:00:39] knock out
[2:00:42] you knock out. They knock you and you
[2:00:44] get out of your cell.
[2:00:50] But to the children of God,
[2:00:53] brother, sister,
[2:00:55] Jesus took your KO.
[2:00:59] That's why he came on the cross.
[2:01:02] Praise be to God. Before Jesus came, the
[2:01:06] prophet were not the devil's march.
[2:01:14] When Jesus came on the cross,
[2:01:17] the prophets,
[2:01:19] they could not manage
[2:01:22] to overcome the devil
[2:01:25] and overcome that spirit of death.
[2:01:30] That is why all of them died. Praise be
[2:01:32] to God.
[2:01:34] Amen.
[2:01:40] But the amazing thing, even though they
[2:01:42] died, they remained
[2:01:44] when Elisha died
[2:01:48] and they brought back a dead man.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; When when there was a dead man who fell
[2:01:57] onto the bones,
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; of the dead prophet.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; That dead man came back to life.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; When a believer died, fully charged.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; You die with power. What you need to do,
[2:02:14] the only thing you need to do is for God
[2:02:17] to give you the the the
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; earnest of the Holy Spirit.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:02:24] Amen. So before Jesus came, the devil
[2:02:28] knew the point of doing it.
[2:02:33] And that's why all of them feared death
[2:02:37] after Elijah consuming the 400 prophets.
[2:02:43] And he had that Jezebel had sworn by
[2:02:47] that today
[2:02:50] you are head
[2:02:52] to my prophet is what is coming to you.
[2:02:56] The Bible says the man took off. He ran
[2:03:00] for his life.
[2:03:02] We forgot that. They even forgot where
[2:03:04] the fire came from.
[2:03:06] The fire never came from Elijah.
[2:03:09] The fire came from heaven.
[2:03:12] [Music]
[2:03:13] Amen. He was supposed to stand
[2:03:17] and call that same God
[2:03:20] and consume that
[2:03:23] this wicked woman. But the man of God
[2:03:25] forgot
[2:03:27] and he thought came from him.
[2:03:31] So he took off
[2:03:34] running for his life.
[2:03:37] Amen.
[2:03:39] Then one day
[2:03:41] it was declared in heaven.
[2:03:44] The champion of the champion was born,
[2:03:48] the king of kings and the lord of lords.
[2:03:51] His name is Jesus.
[2:03:53] Praise be to God. Amen. He started going
[2:03:57] through a training
[2:04:00] when he was 12.
[2:04:02] He invaded the temple.
[2:04:05] That was part of his training.
[2:04:08] He started preaching, telling them about
[2:04:10] where he came from, telling them about
[2:04:13] the land.
[2:04:17] Yeah, there is a land where he came
[2:04:18] from.
[2:04:20] And I'm telling that land, you don't
[2:04:21] even grow old.
[2:04:23] That's why he told them before Abraham
[2:04:27] I was he was speaking the heaven
[2:04:29] language
[2:04:31] which they could not understand.
[2:04:33] They only understood theology language
[2:04:37] where they say Moses
[2:04:40] never crossed the Red Sea.
[2:04:43] But the children of Israel they cross by
[2:04:48] the sea.
[2:04:54] That is theology.
[2:04:57] Here comes man from heaven,
[2:05:00] the pillar of fire in flesh. Now, the
[2:05:04] one who led them, he was speaking of
[2:05:06] what he did.
[2:05:10] Yes sir. Jesus was speaking of himself.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That is the difference.
[2:05:21] between the bride of Christ
[2:05:23] and the nominal church believer.
[2:05:28] Praise be to God. When they speaking of
[2:05:32] the message,
[2:05:34] they know what they are speaking about.
[2:05:36] They know why the message came
[2:05:39] and they know where the message got
[2:05:41] them.
[2:05:43] Praise be to God. They don't fuss around
[2:05:46] with it
[2:05:48] because they know the land is real.
[2:05:51] Amen. Through this message, we have
[2:05:54] received the Holy Ghost and then you are
[2:05:57] coming with your own kind of stuff.
[2:06:00] And you're telling us the message is not
[2:06:03] true.
[2:06:08] Some need psychiatrist.
[2:06:12] Spiritual psych.
[2:06:17] Praise be to God.
[2:06:20] You have used the boat
[2:06:23] and you cross the river and after you
[2:06:26] have reached the banks of the river,
[2:06:29] you are criticizing the boat.
[2:06:34] You have a problem.
[2:06:36] Praise be to God. But not to those
[2:06:39] people
[2:06:41] who know that there was a land
[2:06:44] because they had an evidence.
[2:06:47] Blessed be the name of him. They know
[2:06:50] that the blood cell of God is in their
[2:06:52] life.
[2:06:55] And that's what brings separation.
[2:06:58] It's only the blood of Christ.
[2:07:01] When we find that you have not
[2:07:03] separated,
[2:07:05] you are still reasoning with the word
[2:07:09] because your bloodline
[2:07:12] has problem.
[2:07:16] Praise be to God.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; You need to go to the doctor,
[2:07:22] Dr. Jesus
[2:07:24] and check your lineage,
[2:07:27] you realize through the the prophet's
[2:07:30] preaching,
[2:07:32] do you know that in most of all if if
[2:07:34] not all his sermons
[2:07:39] also far the one I have read,
[2:07:42] you will find brother
[2:07:44] He always bring these two groups of
[2:07:47] people
[2:07:49] in every message he preach.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; He could not forget the serpent. Praise
[2:07:58] be to God because that's how it was
[2:08:02] from Genesis to Revelation.
[2:08:06] In heaven there was Mike and Lucifer.
[2:08:10] In Eden there was Cain.
[2:08:14] There was Esau and Jacob.
[2:08:18] There was Jesus and Judah.
[2:08:21] Praise be to God.
[2:08:23] So those two they walking together.
[2:08:28] So when you find yourself
[2:08:31] things are not
[2:08:34] go back and trace your blood.
[2:08:38] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:08:41] But we thank God.
[2:08:43] And we know where we are going by the
[2:08:46] grace of God.
[2:08:49] The world we are living in
[2:08:52] is not fit for us.
[2:08:55] There is a land where we are going.
[2:08:59] Amen. And we are conure
[2:09:03] and we are pulled by that land.
[2:09:06] Praise be to God. Many time we are so
[2:09:09] cautious about our bosses.
[2:09:13] Why have you not come? My boss has
[2:09:16] refused me.
[2:09:19] But those the same bosses of yours.
[2:09:22] You'll be surprised one of these days.
[2:09:25] They will tell you tomorrow.
[2:09:28] They will tell you that your boss passed
[2:09:30] on the night
[2:09:32] and where will you go?
[2:09:36] He knew me better. Promotion promised a
[2:09:40] promotion.
[2:09:41] But now he's gone.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm done.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; our promotion comes from God.
[2:09:52] Let us trust God.
[2:09:55] Amen. Let us wait on him. Let us do his
[2:09:59] will.
[2:10:01] Praise be to God. Even when our earthly
[2:10:04] bosses are gone,
[2:10:06] they will still keep us.
[2:10:11] Praise be to God. Amen. I was telling
[2:10:14] you something
[2:10:17] that a Christian
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; we are overcome because we allow to be
[2:10:20] overcome.
[2:10:23] Jesus took all our punches.
[2:10:27] He rubbed all our delicate part.
[2:10:32] Praise be to God. Human beings had
[2:10:35] delicate part
[2:10:38] and fighters always look for that part.
[2:10:43] Praise be to God. Medical doctors knows
[2:10:48] there's where someone can squeeze you
[2:10:50] and
[2:10:51] and you faint.
[2:10:54] Jesus knew very well.
[2:10:57] Amen. and all those parts he covered
[2:11:02] by going to the cross
[2:11:04] dying and rising.
[2:11:07] And today the devil bribes you
[2:11:13] and you take easy bribery fornication
[2:11:16] [Music]
[2:11:19] of lies.
[2:11:22] Amen. Of bitterness
[2:11:25] of hatred. The moment you receive that
[2:11:29] you are gone.
[2:11:32] You have bleached through your you have
[2:11:34] bleached into your uh your h.
[2:11:40] Blessed be the name of the lord. It's
[2:11:43] not god who is failed.
[2:11:45] That is you are failing. It's you who
[2:11:46] have failed your soul.
[2:11:50] Blessed be the name of the lord.
[2:11:53] Amen. But when we know that there is
[2:11:55] something we are fighting,
[2:11:59] you will hardly give up.
[2:12:02] You will fight to the last moment.
[2:12:06] Amen. You'll trust God regardless of
[2:12:08] what happened.
[2:12:12] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:12:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because we know
[2:12:18] we'll be having a reason to live.
[2:12:22] Daniel by the word.
[2:12:24] He was reading the prophets scroll.
[2:12:29] Their time for going back was near.
[2:12:32] The Bible says he passed in his heart.
[2:12:35] Why? Because there was a land was going
[2:12:38] back.
[2:12:40] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[2:12:43] here God himself speaking to Joshua
[2:12:46] and telling him, I will never leave you.
[2:12:50] No man will be able to stand before you.
[2:12:57] God can't start something and stop it in
[2:12:59] the middle.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; You never believe the message stop on
[2:13:01] the way.
[2:13:04] How many remain in the Catholics?
[2:13:06] How many remain in the denomination
[2:13:10] came out because God pulled you out?
[2:13:14] Many times alongside the way
[2:13:18] when we reach in the way we are
[2:13:21] distracted.
[2:13:24] Praise be to God.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; These men who are perverting the
[2:13:27] children of God
[2:13:30] who are doing it now is because of their
[2:13:34] own selfishness ambitions.
[2:13:39] Praise be to God. They know the word is
[2:13:42] true.
[2:13:43] They know the message is the Bible is
[2:13:45] the absolute.
[2:13:47] They know the message not contradict
[2:13:48] with the Bible.
[2:13:50] But because somebody may promise them
[2:13:52] something
[2:13:55] because they want to make a big namely.
[2:14:00] They drift from the word
[2:14:03] and they force the native
[2:14:06] to believe
[2:14:08] in their gain saying
[2:14:12] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:14:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother says God
[2:14:19] is looking for a man
[2:14:21] and women who are going to stand like
[2:14:24] Daniel.
[2:14:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Are you
[2:14:28] here? Are you ready to stand like
[2:14:30] Daniel?
[2:14:33] Blessed be the name of the Lord. That's
[2:14:35] what God is looking for.
[2:14:38] Praise the Lord. There's a land where we
[2:14:40] are going
[2:14:42] [Music]
[2:14:43] and Jesus is there.
[2:14:46] The lamp is the light there.
[2:14:50] That's why we give you the word.
[2:14:53] We don't give you our own word.
[2:14:56] The word of him who is there who has a
[2:14:58] witness.
[2:15:00] Praise be to God who was on earth same
[2:15:03] time in heaven.
[2:15:05] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[2:15:08] that's why we are giving the word every
[2:15:09] day. We are telling that brethren there
[2:15:11] is a land
[2:15:13] and the land is real.
[2:15:16] Praise be to God. Righteousness reign.
[2:15:20] Praise the Lord.
[2:15:23] Amen. Amen.
[2:15:37] But when
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; we're going to
[2:15:50] all right. Yeah. He said here that there
[2:15:53] there is a witness called Joshua
[2:15:58] which means Jehovah's Savior
[2:16:01] crossed over Jordan into the land
[2:16:04] and we turned back into the turn back
[2:16:06] with the evidence
[2:16:08] that the land was just exactly what the
[2:16:10] prophet said
[2:16:15] it was with the word of God.
[2:16:18] They had a bunch of grapes
[2:16:21] taken two men pack
[2:16:28] and they called and they could taste the
[2:16:30] original fruit from the land.
[2:16:35] Nobody know the land.
[2:16:39] They just believed it.
[2:16:42] They walked out by faith.
[2:16:46] Now when they inherited the when they
[2:16:48] inhed their land,
[2:16:51] how happy they was.
[2:16:53] Each one could live in peace,
[2:16:59] have his little garden,
[2:17:03] have his children and everything.
[2:17:07] But yet the old old age finally got him
[2:17:12] and death cornered him.
[2:17:16] and took him.
[2:17:19] Then down from the corners of heaven
[2:17:23] through a woman
[2:17:25] came another great warrior,
[2:17:28] the greatest of all them
[2:17:32] called himself made flesh
[2:17:35] in the flesh Jesus Christ.
[2:17:38] And he told Israel
[2:17:40] what a great people they had been.
[2:17:44] But death faced them.
[2:17:47] He say, "But I'm telling you of another
[2:17:49] land.
[2:17:51] In my father's house are many.
[2:17:54] If it wasn't so, I would have not told
[2:17:57] you.
[2:17:58] You are happy in your land.
[2:18:02] You have your homes.
[2:18:04] You have your children.
[2:18:06] But you are buying each one of each one
[2:18:09] out yonder."
[2:18:12] and and it seems it it seems to be the
[2:18:16] end.
[2:18:21] Amen.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Here I
[2:18:26] say that now remember none of them had
[2:18:28] never been there
[2:18:33] and they never know there was even a
[2:18:35] land.
[2:18:37] just by faith went went
[2:18:41] by what was told to them.
[2:18:44] Amen. Amen. God had a place for them
[2:18:49] and there was going to that place
[2:18:52] just by faith.
[2:18:55] Now think of that, left Egypt and God
[2:18:59] brought them out
[2:19:02] and now they are nearing the land.
[2:19:05] And when they got near the land,
[2:19:08] Joshua goes over into the land,
[2:19:12] brings back the evidence,
[2:19:14] crosses Jordan, goes over into
[2:19:17] Palestine, bring back the evidence,
[2:19:20] great bunch of grapes,
[2:19:22] that taken two men to pack.
[2:19:27] Amen. And they could eat those grapes
[2:19:31] and say, "The land is just
[2:19:37] Notice then
[2:19:39] the preparation for his promised land.
[2:19:44] Notice what he's saying. First he had
[2:19:48] the people that he had made a land for
[2:19:50] them.
[2:19:54] He had prepared a land for them.
[2:19:57] And now he send them down there a
[2:19:59] preparation for it.
[2:20:04] For the promised land people,
[2:20:07] it was only for those who were
[2:20:09] predestinated to that promised land.
[2:20:16] He said bride day
[2:20:20] and how and how he done it.
[2:20:24] He sent a prophet with a message
[2:20:28] identified by the pillar of fire.
[2:20:32] ever talking that they could rest assure
[2:20:38] that it was right.
[2:20:40] That is right.
[2:20:42] It was her consolation.
[2:20:46] This is what God has done in our day.
[2:20:50] He has sent a prophet
[2:20:53] with a message vindicated
[2:20:56] the pillar of fire. Amen. To prepare the
[2:20:59] bride.
[2:21:01] Prepare for what?
[2:21:04] For a land.
[2:21:06] Brother, there is a land.
[2:21:09] We're not here just to become another
[2:21:10] human being.
[2:21:13] Just bunch of nice people,
[2:21:16] smart people. We are here for a cause.
[2:21:20] We are going somewhere.
[2:21:23] Amen. Amen. The word is preparing us
[2:21:28] for a place,
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; perfect place.
[2:21:33] Amen.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; We should never forget that.
[2:21:42] We don't just come to church every
[2:21:44] Sunday.
[2:21:50] We are preparing for something.
[2:21:53] You are preparing for a land.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Your crying is not in vain.
[2:22:03] But sometimes because your theophan is
[2:22:05] close to you
[2:22:08] and you look back and see what God has
[2:22:09] done,
[2:22:12] others help you fighting your battles.
[2:22:16] You would be out there in B.
[2:22:19] But you are here with a clear
[2:22:22] conscience.
[2:22:24] You know the kind of person you are.
[2:22:27] You know that you are part of God.
[2:22:30] You are spial being
[2:22:32] flesh.
[2:22:35] Praise be to God. There is a land
[2:22:38] brother
[2:22:39] where we are going.
[2:22:42] Hallelujah. We have a proof
[2:22:46] of his salvation.
[2:22:48] If the reason why you're objecting the
[2:22:50] world,
[2:22:56] it is because
[2:22:58] you have not received the earnest of
[2:23:00] your spirit.
[2:23:04] Tells us that without the Holy Spirit,
[2:23:08] you've not even become the worshipper.
[2:23:10] You not even started worshiping God.
[2:23:14] Just in the process,
[2:23:20] If you are making chapati,
[2:23:23] you are still in the in the process of
[2:23:25] making the wheat.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; You are not yet a chapati.
[2:23:32] But the master is interested in chapati.
[2:23:36] He's interested in the final product.
[2:23:40] But still is him doing it.
[2:23:43] But you have got your part to play. When
[2:23:45] your sister or brother go overseas,
[2:23:49] or your father goes overseas
[2:23:52] and he calls home and tells you that
[2:23:57] that he's coming back.
[2:24:00] Oh brother,
[2:24:04] there is a preparation.
[2:24:08] There is a preparation.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; There is a budget.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. They come out with bad jet
[2:24:16] because they are missing you.
[2:24:18] You are missing. You are missing them as
[2:24:21] well.
[2:24:25] That cat will be slaughtered. That will
[2:24:27] be slaughtered. The cake will be
[2:24:29] prepared.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; That cow will be slaughtered.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:43] Amen.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:24:51] Preparation
[2:24:53] because their son or daughter is coming.
[2:24:59] Even you do shopping. Yes. Because
[2:25:02] they're waiting for you.
[2:25:08] The long awaited day when it comes to
[2:25:10] pass.
[2:25:12] when you're going to come on the airport
[2:25:14] at 10,
[2:25:16] they reach at 6:00 in the morning or at
[2:25:18] 7
[2:25:20] because they have been missing you.
[2:25:24] Others even make flower bouquets.
[2:25:29] Let the worldly things teach us the
[2:25:31] heavenly things.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:36] But many times children of God
[2:25:39] they think God is there very angry with
[2:25:41] them.
[2:25:58] Praise be to God. Amen.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Many time when you stray. He looks at
[2:26:04] your heart.
[2:26:05] [Music]
[2:26:08] Before even you repent,
[2:26:11] he forgives you because he knows he not
[2:26:13] intended.
[2:26:17] Praise be to God. For us we think God
[2:26:19] has put very hard thing on us.
[2:26:22] [Music]
[2:26:24] No. That's why Jesus came.
[2:26:27] Praise be to God. He came to prepare us.
[2:26:34] Even God is not settled.
[2:26:36] He's waiting for the last bride
[2:26:41] to enter.
[2:26:43] Amen.
[2:26:45] Just imagine
[2:26:47] millions of children of God
[2:26:50] by their theophony
[2:26:53] and they're here on earth and God is
[2:26:56] missing that fellowship.
[2:26:59] So every time
[2:27:02] is there waiting?
[2:27:04] Where are they coming?
[2:27:06] Where is that last one? sees that last
[2:27:09] one where he
[2:27:17] let each one mean what they are doing.
[2:27:20] Let us fasten this job.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, the bride has made herself ready.
[2:27:27] Make yourself ready.
[2:27:29] Let God do his part.
[2:27:33] Amen. Amen. The preparation is going on.
[2:27:37] Amen.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of
[2:27:41] flowers are there.
[2:27:45] The the spices, the perfumes
[2:27:49] perfume.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; Today you buy a perfume
[2:27:52] and you use it in one day or in one
[2:27:54] month.
[2:27:56] All this one you use it. When you
[2:27:58] perfume yourself
[2:28:01] tomorrow, you don't want to put on the
[2:28:02] same clothes,
[2:28:07] it has mixed with other things. You feel
[2:28:09] you don't want that.
[2:28:11] But the perfume
[2:28:14] which is in heaven,
[2:28:16] the preparations in heaven, it is
[2:28:18] different
[2:28:21] smells good forever.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. for we have a place where we are
[2:28:29] a land. Amen. Amen. There is a land
[2:28:35] preparing for his children.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; That is where we are heading.
[2:28:42] That lands
[2:28:46] won't enter there.
[2:28:49] The one with painted bodies won't go
[2:28:52] there.
[2:28:56] Amen.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; But only those
[2:29:03] who are painted
[2:29:05] by the word of God.
[2:29:08] Let me tell you brethren,
[2:29:10] Christian also have our makeup.
[2:29:14] Yes, we have our makeup.
[2:29:20] You want to know the makeup we have?
[2:29:29] Praise be to God.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus is using this makeup.
[2:29:35] He does everything
[2:29:39] that he want in us.
[2:29:42] Hallelujah. That's why when you come
[2:29:45] with your eye pencil,
[2:29:48] this word will detest it.
[2:29:52] Yes sir. When you come with your closer
[2:29:57] the word will you test it.
[2:30:01] This the one I will make up
[2:30:03] tested tried
[2:30:08] thoroughly furnishing of the bride.

[2:30:25] road map to glory.
[2:30:28] The road map of the power of God.
[2:30:32] Amen. The road of the promised land.
[2:30:35] The road map of the B of the Holy Ghost.
[2:30:40] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:30:43] Amen. Amen. The reason asked why many
[2:30:46] times when trial come when we are tried
[2:30:50] by God we fail is because we read wrong
[2:30:55] notes.

[2:31:03] but every time you are with Bout

[2:31:24] praise be to God and then you say I am
[2:31:28] ready for
[2:31:33] before we realize.
[2:31:36] Pray for me, brethren.
[2:31:39] The other day, my friend uh called me. I
[2:31:44] had appointment with him.
[2:31:47] We are meeting at a certain bus
[2:31:48] somewhere.
[2:31:51] So I first asked for
[2:31:57] mama
[2:32:02] said this one have pineapple
[2:32:05] forever
[2:32:09] and I ended up doing what?
[2:32:12] Why? Because you are reading wrong
[2:32:14] notes.
[2:32:16] If you read this notes and you believe
[2:32:19] this word, you will never go wrong,
[2:32:22] brother.
[2:32:23] This is full package.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, this Bible
[2:32:31] shows us what's not in that land where
[2:32:33] we are going.
[2:32:38] Amen.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:32:45] You will know that in the land where I'm
[2:32:47] going,
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; there is no
[2:32:50] [Music]
[2:32:53] sir.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; It's not there.
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:33:00] Read your Bible.
[2:33:03] Listen to the message.
[2:33:06] There is a land where we are going.
[2:33:09] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; He said the land, it says there is a
[2:33:17] land where man don't die.
[2:33:22] In my father's house,
[2:33:25] if it wasn't, I would have not told you.
[2:33:28] I go to prepare your face and return to
[2:33:32] receive you.
[2:33:34] is the prophet that come
[2:33:39] speaking of the land
[2:33:42] just beyond Jordan
[2:33:46] the river Jordan
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; death where that where even even though
[2:33:52] you've got your farms you've got your
[2:33:54] families you you are blessed of God but
[2:33:57] yet you have to die
[2:34:05] The prophets talk of the other Jordan
[2:34:08] where the Israel were going
[2:34:11] their promised land. It's not the one
[2:34:14] I'm talking about.
[2:34:16] The other one was a type and shadow
[2:34:20] for our spiritual Israel.
[2:34:23] The physical Israel possessed it.
[2:34:28] Amen. Tell us also about promised land.
[2:34:31] And the prophet says the Holy Ghost.
[2:34:35] And here says that there was another
[2:34:38] kadesh
[2:34:40] called Calvary.
[2:34:43] Hallelujah. The judgment seat of God.
[2:34:48] Blessed be the name of the Lord. He
[2:34:50] saying I came to
[2:34:54] Calvary the judgment seat again
[2:34:58] where the penalty of sin
[2:35:01] that cause men to die.
[2:35:04] It was met at judgment.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:17] That was another judgment seat.
[2:35:22] And Jesus went there.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; He crossed over.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; He went to the promised land. He came
[2:35:29] with the evidence and tells us in my
[2:35:34] father's house,
[2:35:36] "Oh brother, are many mansions
[2:35:40] [Music]
[2:35:42] and that's where we are going.
[2:35:45] There is a land.
[2:35:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There is a land.
[2:35:52] There is a land, brother.
[2:35:55] There's a land. Sister
[2:35:57] Jesus went to prepare a place
[2:36:01] said and then on the day of Pentecost
[2:36:04] he sits by he sends back the earnest
[2:36:09] of this place
[2:36:11] the assurance
[2:36:13] the evidence
[2:36:15] that the land is real
[2:36:18] like Joshua brought back the evidence
[2:36:22] Jesus brought back the evidence of the
[2:36:24] Holy Ghost.
[2:36:27] Now
[2:36:28] record our we record ourselves dead.
[2:36:33] We are buried with him in baptism
[2:36:36] after his death
[2:36:38] and we rise with him in the resurrection
[2:36:43] and now we are in.
[2:36:45] We are in
[2:36:47] not we are going.
[2:36:50] We are already raised.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my We are now not we will be
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; we are now tonight sitting
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; in heaven places.
[2:37:05] How in Christ Jesus
[2:37:07] not we will not we will be some other
[2:37:11] time we are now the church don't realize
[2:37:15] who you are.
[2:37:17] [Music]
[2:37:20] Hallelujah.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:24] Praise the Lord.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came,
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; see we don't get to only to die of old
[2:37:35] age again.
[2:37:39] There are those who will be raptured.
[2:37:43] I just pray that rapture comes in my
[2:37:44] time.
[2:37:49] Blessed be the name of
[2:37:55] we have a reason why we are still
[2:37:57] pushing on.
[2:38:02] You must have a reason.
[2:38:06] All of us have challenges
[2:38:09] but let us read the right notes.
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; Message believer
[2:38:18] is reading book.
[2:38:22] Yes.
[2:38:28] Believer,
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; you listen to worldly music.
[2:38:33] [Music]
[2:38:38] Praise the Lord.
[2:38:40] But I'm here to tell you,
[2:38:43] never forget that there is a land where
[2:38:45] we are born.
[2:38:48] And that land
[2:38:53] Abraham purchas it with his money.
[2:38:57] That was the land of resurrection
[2:39:02] where he buried his people.
[2:39:04] Even Joseph said, "Take me back
[2:39:09] in that land,
[2:39:12] the promised land.
[2:39:15] Blessed be the name of God.
[2:39:18] But I'm telling you of another land
[2:39:21] which was purchased by Jesus Christ.
[2:39:24] He purchased by his own blood.
[2:39:28] Hallelujah.
[2:39:29] And that's why today
[2:39:32] you are supposed to be buried in Christ.
[2:39:35] [Music]
[2:39:37] Be buried in Christ.
[2:39:41] Whosoever believes and baptized
[2:39:44] they shall be saved.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is the land of
[2:39:50] resurrection.
[2:39:53] Be buried.
[2:39:55] Die of your own soul.
[2:39:57] Rose to your soul.
[2:40:00] Be buried in Christ. Not there, brother.
[2:40:05] Rise in the Holy Ghost.
[2:40:08] Rise the newness of life.
[2:40:11] And you will see that land.
[2:40:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord. That
[2:40:18] land where they went,
[2:40:20] the prophet tells us, it has a good
[2:40:23] fruit.
[2:40:25] I thought it was a fatile land,
[2:40:27] flowing milk and honey. But there is
[2:40:30] another land, brother, sister. The land
[2:40:32] is Jesus Christ.
[2:40:35] Hallelujah.
[2:40:36] It is flowing with gifts,
[2:40:39] those with healings,
[2:40:41] eternal life,
[2:40:43] wisdom,
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; victory,
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of
[2:40:48] Hallelujah.
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; I am summarizing. I want to finish
[2:41:05] say that that but he crossed also the
[2:41:08] Jordan.
[2:41:12] In the message confirmation and the
[2:41:14] evidence
[2:41:17] and said the judgment seat was kadesh
[2:41:19] bane
[2:41:21] to kadesh bane calvary upon him bore all
[2:41:26] the sins of the world at Calvary.
[2:41:32] Amen. And it say that he went over into
[2:41:35] the land into other land
[2:41:38] and was dead for three days
[2:41:42] and night.
[2:41:44] He died till the sun quit shining.
[2:41:51] And he died till the earth had nervous
[2:41:55] breakdown.
[2:41:58] He shook the rocks
[2:42:01] out of the mountain.
[2:42:03] He died
[2:42:05] and on the third day
[2:42:08] he rose back again with the evidence
[2:42:12] that there is a land where a man can
[2:42:14] live and not die.
[2:42:19] He returned back from the land.
[2:42:22] There is life after death.
[2:42:26] And you hear people say,
[2:42:31] "How can you prove
[2:42:34] that when you die there is another
[2:42:35] life?" Which proof do you have?
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; The proof you have Jesus.
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:48] That's why
[2:42:51] even the young rich ruler
[2:42:56] when he wanted to go back
[2:42:59] requested to go
[2:43:02] preach to his house
[2:43:04] to believe Abraham told him you have the
[2:43:08] prophets
[2:43:12] the prophets
[2:43:14] were preaching Jesus Ask
[2:43:17] Jesus is the only proof that there is
[2:43:21] life after tear.
[2:43:25] You don't need any other proof.
[2:43:28] Muhammad says even where I'm going, I
[2:43:31] don't know.
[2:43:34] But ask the son of ask is
[2:43:42] praise be to God. They were not sure
[2:43:46] the Muhammad
[2:43:50] the Buddhas.
[2:43:54] Praise be to God.
[2:43:58] All of them.
[2:44:00] All of them died not knowing their
[2:44:02] destination. But there's a man who knew
[2:44:04] the land where he came from.
[2:44:07] He spoke with authority
[2:44:09] because he had an evidence.
[2:44:12] He told the Pharisees
[2:44:15] Hey,
[2:44:17] break this temple
[2:44:20] and I assure you in just 3 days within 3
[2:44:25] days
[2:44:26] the temple is going to be up again.
[2:44:30] He knew what he was potential of doing.
[2:44:36] Brother, sister, there is something that
[2:44:39] your potential of doing.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; There is a connection from that land.
[2:44:54] That's why when you face the devil,
[2:44:57] he will start to tremble.
[2:45:00] Why? He's seeing a stranger
[2:45:04] from the fra land.
[2:45:07] Why will the devil tremble?
[2:45:10] He was kicked out of that land.
[2:45:14] And when he sees ambassadors
[2:45:17] of that land,
[2:45:20] he knows they are kicking me up again.
[2:45:23] That's where we came from.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; The land, the glory land.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why the Bible say we shall
[2:45:33] lay our hands on the sick
[2:45:36] and they shall recover.
[2:45:38] Amen. Amen. When we have patience,
[2:45:42] when we have patient, patient,
[2:45:46] when we approach patient,
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; praise be to God because we didn't we
[2:45:53] are not from this land
[2:45:56] and the sicknesses of this land,
[2:46:00] we are infected sometime by them
[2:46:02] sickness.
[2:46:04] Blessed be the name of the Lord. But
[2:46:07] when we come
[2:46:10] Amen. After we have known who we are,
[2:46:14] where we came from, when we meet this
[2:46:17] fellow,
[2:46:19] hallelujah, because it's part of us,
[2:46:23] this strange sickness,
[2:46:26] these demons will tremble.
[2:46:29] Hallelujah.
[2:46:31] Brother said sometime when he was
[2:46:33] praying for the sick,
[2:46:36] other demons could call for enforcement.
[2:46:40] Praise be to God.
[2:46:44] When you confront the sick person
[2:46:47] and the sick person believes in the
[2:46:49] world, hallelujah, the devil will have
[2:46:52] to go because you have two things in
[2:46:55] common.
[2:46:57] There is a connection between you
[2:47:00] and his patient.
[2:47:02] Praise be to God. So believers, we know
[2:47:06] what we are talking about.
[2:47:08] We know that the message is true
[2:47:11] that God is real.
[2:47:14] We are sure that this word cast the
[2:47:18] devil.
[2:47:20] Hallelujah.
[2:47:22] That's what we need to sink in our
[2:47:25] heart.
[2:47:27] [Music]
[2:47:30] Blessed be the name of God.
[2:47:32] The only way God has shallowed
[2:47:37] to send his word to us
[2:47:40] and through preaching
[2:47:43] is you to believe
[2:47:45] and the word will work for you.
[2:47:48] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:47:51] Amen.
[2:47:53] So when the Bible say that we are Christ
[2:47:55] ambassador,
[2:47:58] brother we ambassadors of heaven,
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; we are representing another country.
[2:48:08] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was so sure.
[2:48:16] Do you know why even when like it sound
[2:48:20] like he was even bragging
[2:48:27] break this temple
[2:48:31] in three days my father will raise it
[2:48:33] up. didn't say
[2:48:36] no sir. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; He is the chief engineer.
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. He said break this temple
[2:48:47] in just three days.
[2:48:50] Indeed they broke it
[2:48:54] to prove.
[2:48:56] Let him prove.
[2:48:59] And when they came on the cross breaking
[2:49:02] the legs of this
[2:49:05] when they reach on this one
[2:49:09] you don't need to break his leg.
[2:49:11] This is the one who say we break
[2:49:14] yesterday even these thieves are
[2:49:17] stronger than him.
[2:49:23] &gt;&gt; It was it was a tactic.
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:49:27] Because the Bible say
[2:49:29] none of his born was supposed to.
[2:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus still warn
[2:49:40] blessed be the name of the Lord. So for
[2:49:43] them they thought
[2:49:46] it was that temple they are looking at.
[2:49:49] But on the third day, there and there,
[2:49:52] by the way, when he died, when he gave
[2:49:55] up the ghost, there was an earthquake.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus, what was he doing?
[2:50:03] Hallelujah. He was raising the
[2:50:05] foundation of that temple.
[2:50:10] Amen. He was shaking them. On the third
[2:50:14] day,
[2:50:15] he proved to them
[2:50:17] [Applause]
[2:50:20] Hallelujah.
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; 40 days
[2:50:23] after Jesus resurrected,
[2:50:25] he walked with them
[2:50:27] &gt;&gt; on the streets.
[2:50:31] What were they doing?
[2:50:33] &gt;&gt; They were a witness.
[2:50:36] Hallelujah.
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; Of the promised land.
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Like Joshua cross
[2:50:45] and came with evidence when Jesus rose
[2:50:49] who was our Joshua.
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; He came with a proof.
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; 40 days they saw Abraham.
[2:51:02] Amen. They saw the shame. They knew that
[2:51:06] was bitter.
[2:51:09] Hallelujah.
[2:51:10] 40 days.
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; Then after Jesus went away,
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; praise be to God.
[2:51:20] &gt;&gt; Now we know what we're talking about.
[2:51:26] Spiritual land is real.
[2:51:30] One time brother Shem was teaching us.
[2:51:32] He was showing us the dimensions.
[2:51:37] It's just here.
[2:51:43] Death is just switching of dimension.
[2:51:50] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:51:53] That's why the prophet tells us, "Oh,
[2:51:55] brother Bos when he was going
[2:51:59] he saw him greeting brother so and so
[2:52:03] him greeting so
[2:52:06] it's like us here the brother's been
[2:52:09] down and is going through the Lord
[2:52:12] and you see him greeting
[2:52:15] brother God bless you then greets my
[2:52:18] mother you know God bless you
[2:52:21] God bless
[2:52:22] is switching
[2:52:25] is phasing from this dimension
[2:52:29] to another one.
[2:52:31] Praise be to God. That's why the prophet
[2:52:34] tells us Christians should not fear
[2:52:37] death.
[2:52:40] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:52:43] You start seeing the things you have
[2:52:44] been working on.
[2:52:48] Hallelujah.
[2:52:49] You start hearing that angel song
[2:52:57] because there is a land you have been
[2:52:58] longing for.
[2:53:03] Praise be to God.
[2:53:06] And every now and then it's getting too
[2:53:08] close.
[2:53:11] Never allow anything stand between you
[2:53:12] and your God.
[2:53:16] I believe that's how Enoch was. After he
[2:53:20] had lived his life, he had done whatever
[2:53:23] he was supposed to do. I believe he must
[2:53:25] have even set his family in order.
[2:53:29] He started walking with God. He started
[2:53:32] walking with God. And one day the man
[2:53:35] switched the dimension
[2:53:39] and he was not there's
[2:53:41] grave is not on earth.
[2:53:46] Praise be to God.
[2:53:49] Hallelujah.
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:51] &gt;&gt; Went to that land.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; Enoch is not even in the land of
[2:53:55] Palestine.
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; He's in glory.
[2:54:00] Some here will tell you there is a land
[2:54:02] brother.
[2:54:04] Let us press on.
[2:54:08] Let us not give up.
[2:54:11] Amen.
[2:54:13] know that the blood of Christ
[2:54:17] is running through your veins.
[2:54:21] &gt;&gt; Brother, you are going to make it.
[2:54:24] I don't care what the devil is.
[2:54:27] We are making it.
[2:54:32] That one is signed.
[2:54:36] That one is forever settled in heaven.
[2:54:40] Whether the devil want it, whether the
[2:54:42] government want it, whether hell want it
[2:54:44] or not,
[2:54:47] hell,
[2:54:49] we are going to make it to glory.
[2:54:55] Amen.
[2:54:57] We are fighting every day.
[2:55:00] We are fighting day by day. We are
[2:55:03] overcoming day by day.
[2:55:06] Yes sir.
[2:55:09] And we are not ready to give up
[2:55:13] because there is a land.
[2:55:15] Jesus convinced.
[2:55:18] Jesus proved
[2:55:20] &gt;&gt; and even he went ahead and told us if it
[2:55:23] wasn't so
[2:55:27] sincerely
[2:55:29] I would have not told
[2:55:34] what else do you need more than that if
[2:55:38] the Hollywood they're trying to play
[2:55:39] heaven
[2:55:43] where do they get inspiration from
[2:55:47] they don't even read the Bible,
[2:55:51] but the devil gives them inspiration
[2:55:54] and then they do something familiar
[2:56:00] and make people think that it's just a
[2:56:02] drama.
[2:56:05] Yes, that's what the devil does.
[2:56:08] A woman wakes up in the morning.
[2:56:11] He walks uh puts on a short,
[2:56:15] moves in the street and
[2:56:22] people give birth
[2:56:26] tomorrow,
[2:56:28] one week
[2:56:31] they start speaking some funny funny
[2:56:33] words.
[2:56:36] &gt;&gt; The woman looks good already. They are
[2:56:37] forgotten.
[2:56:40] So the devil makes them get used to sin
[2:56:46] until they think it is normal to sin
[2:56:51] until until this homosexuals they fight
[2:56:54] for their right.
[2:56:57] You see
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; but Christian
[2:57:03] &gt;&gt; let us not get used to take God's thing
[2:57:07] just ordinary.
[2:57:13] Never give up until
[2:57:16] you are sure that you are connected to
[2:57:17] that.
[2:57:19] [Music]
[2:57:20] know in your heart whether you are
[2:57:23] offended
[2:57:24] whether you are rejected but in your
[2:57:27] heart per in your heart that I have
[2:57:31] somewhere where I'm going
[2:57:35] even students at school
[2:57:41] a teacher can become a problem
[2:57:45] you
[2:57:46] always
[2:57:48] tell you to come and
[2:57:50] go and bring me water, do this, do that.
[2:57:54] The teacher can be on you,
[2:57:58] but that that one cannot mean that you
[2:58:01] are wrong student.
[2:58:03] Even if you didn't go to school and they
[2:58:05] do something wrong,
[2:58:08] they say
[2:58:10] you were not even present
[2:58:13] and that one does not take you off
[2:58:14] track. We have a target.
[2:58:19] There is somewhere where we are going.
[2:58:23] That is the main main goal.
[2:58:28] It's not what brother Martin say.
[2:58:31] What is God saying? What's God saying
[2:58:33] about you?
[2:58:36] It's not how and so discouraging.
[2:58:39] But what's God speaking about?
[2:58:42] He says, "I know the things I have.
[2:58:48] What is God speaking about your life?
[2:58:53] But sometime you forget.
[2:58:56] &gt;&gt; We are men pleasers.
[2:59:00] Let us be God pleasers.
[2:59:05] Yes. If God is happy, just know you are
[2:59:07] winning
[2:59:10] because the joy of the Lord is your
[2:59:11] strength.
[2:59:13] Go. Praise be to God.
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; Joshua never even wanted to please the
[2:59:19] congregation.
[2:59:21] &gt;&gt; He knew what he was talking about.
[2:59:24] Yes, sir.
[2:59:26] Let us stand on our feet.
[2:59:35] Amen.
[2:59:43] May God help us
[2:59:49] &gt;&gt; this journey
[2:59:51] to Calvary. You go alone.
[2:59:56] Everything is already finished.
[3:00:01] What you have to do? You just have to
[3:00:03] look at Christ.
[3:00:09] is the only example.
[3:00:12] That's why we're saying that uh
[3:00:16] to be like Jesus,
[3:00:20] the only thing you ought to long on
[3:00:21] earth is
[3:00:25] to walk like Jesus,
[3:00:27] talk like Jesus.
[3:00:29] Hallelujah.
[3:00:31] Believe like Jesus.
[3:00:35] Jesus was not that kind who just gives
[3:00:37] up.
[3:00:41] Remember one time pastor was preaching
[3:00:43] and told us that Jesus never overcame as
[3:00:45] God but he was man.
[3:00:49] [Music]
[3:00:54] Every time Christian we give up so
[3:00:55] easily.
[3:01:00] But if we know that there is a land
[3:01:02] [Music]
[3:01:04] when I just look at myself
[3:01:10] more than 20 years down the road,
[3:01:15] the things I've forsaken
[3:01:16] [Music]
[3:01:19] they are quite a lot
[3:01:22] and the things which I'm still fighting
[3:01:24] with,
[3:01:26] which I'm still forsaking every Now
[3:01:30] they also still there.
[3:01:32] But when I look back and where I am
[3:01:35] today, I know the journey ahead of me
[3:01:40] is less.
[3:01:41] [Music]
[3:01:46] We have got many discouragement along
[3:01:48] the way.
[3:01:50] We have been disappointed by even our
[3:01:52] own loved ones.
[3:01:56] But that not gave us reason to give up
[3:02:00] because we came to follow Christ.
[3:02:03] We decided we said no turning back
[3:02:10] and we are not ready to turn back.
[3:02:15] [Music]
[3:02:17] Shalom. You give us the song they are
[3:02:18] nailed to the cross.

[3:20:46] Lord we know the sound through the fire
[3:20:50] through the water
[3:20:52] through the blood
[3:20:54] but all through the blood
[3:20:58] that is sufficient.
[3:21:01] We know there is a crimson stream of
[3:21:05] father Lord.
[3:21:08] There is a talk and Lord
[3:21:11] red flag in our hearts.
[3:21:14] Oh hallelujah Lord Jesus
[3:21:19] we cannot do without you.
[3:21:22] &gt;&gt; That when you are in us
[3:21:25] we are overcome Lord.
[3:21:28] We surrender our being to this day.
[3:21:32] We must open our eyes,
[3:21:35] eyes of our understanding
[3:21:37] to know that there is a land.
[3:21:40] There is a place
[3:21:42] somewhere Lord
[3:21:44] where green grass blows.
[3:21:49] Oh Lord Jesus,
[3:21:52] [Music]
[3:21:54] where we'll never grow old.
[3:21:58] where we'll never buy clothes,
[3:22:02] &gt;&gt; where we'll never build houses.
[3:22:05] Father, we thank the Martians
[3:22:08] &gt;&gt; over the hilltop, Lord.
[3:22:11] Oh Jesus, we thank you.
[3:22:17] Maybe you have a need this morning.
[3:22:20] You want the Lord to meet at your
[3:22:25] just your brother.
[3:22:27] But I'm leaning on that word.
[3:22:31] If his word faith, not my word, faith.
[3:22:33] [Music]
[3:22:36] If he leaves you to faith, it is God
[3:22:38] faith. But
[3:22:41] [Music]
[3:22:44] we're going to pray a prayer of faith.
[3:22:47] Maybe you have a need or you are sick in
[3:22:50] the body.
[3:22:52] We are going to pray and we are going to
[3:22:54] believe God for your healing.
[3:22:57] I believe God will grant you a need.
[3:23:00] I've been having a need in my life
[3:23:03] for over a year,
[3:23:07] a huge debt
[3:23:12] and I looked east, west, south, north
[3:23:16] and for sure I could not
[3:23:19] get out of it.
[3:23:25] But I just believed God
[3:23:28] and leave it for him.
[3:23:32] By the time when I was not expected
[3:23:39] me
[3:23:44] and I believe that same God,
[3:23:48] he can surprise you with
[3:23:51] he can surprise you
[3:23:53] by meeting your need.
[3:24:00] And when that happened,
[3:24:04] I mean when it happened to me,
[3:24:07] I remember the sermon that pastor
[3:24:08] preacher said when the devil thought he
[3:24:10] had won.
[3:24:14] [Music]
[3:24:16] That's when God came in.
[3:24:21] your hands. We pray together.
[3:24:23] [Music]
[3:24:34] What you do? Put your hands on your
[3:24:36] neighbor.
[3:24:38] [Music]
[3:24:40] Pray for his needs
[3:24:42] and let him or her pray for your needs.
[3:24:46] And let's pray together.
[3:24:49] The Bible says a prayer of faith
[3:24:52] much.
[3:24:54] Whoever comes to God must believe.
[3:24:57] It's not your brother who's going to
[3:24:59] give you a need
[3:25:01] but God who is going to answer your name
[3:25:06] and we believe we are praying our prayer
[3:25:07] of faith
[3:25:09] and we are waiting for that testimony.
[3:25:12] &gt;&gt; Precious father in the name of Jesus.
[3:25:15] Lord I pray for my brother here. We pray
[3:25:18] for Jesus Christ.

[3:25:50] Jesus Christ. My brother this afternoon
[3:25:54] [Music]
