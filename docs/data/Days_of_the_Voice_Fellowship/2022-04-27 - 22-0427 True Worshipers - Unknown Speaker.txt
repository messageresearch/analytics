[Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] precious lord in the name of jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] in the name of jesus christ satan will render your power to this place father may your glory shine upon us with moses when he was in mount sinai amen [Music] foreign i will begin from 22. it says that ye worship you know not what you know not you worship ye no not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father secret such as to worship him god is spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth [Music] [Music] [Music] then while still standing you read with me 95. that you come and use this modern lips of faith tonight open the eyes of our understanding true worshipers amen praise the lord where we read in the book of john chapter 4 [Music] if you read the whole of that chapter it is jesus conversation with the other woman praise the lord i mean and i know all of us are acquainted with that verse for the scriptures but my major point where my point of interest is uh on this 23 22 23 and 24 and in truth and this means if there is a true worshiper there is also a false worshiper what one you may think that you're worshiping god these are all the sins that control that in truth when you are a false worshiper but jesus said yes we are that the time is coming when the true worshipers have arrested them they will worship god women have seen the catholics in the spirit and in truth praise be to god come here amen i mean some here talk about true worshippers beyond just singing but that let us read psalms 91. 95. sorry [Music] saying come and let us when we come in the presence of god to worship god between them all of us we must involve ourselves in worship today praise be to god i mean because david says come and let us worship let us sing to him praise be to god come and let us sing unto the lord reject let us make a joyful noise to necessary to invent double man amen yes let us let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation [Music] so worship moves with the noise praise be to god i mean there are people who claim that they worship in spirit that i'm singing in my heart praise be to god amen take advantage with all our strengths with all our hearts with all that is within us to be our true worshipper ourselves what is the truth amazing [Applause] amen so we are the true worshippers that did not fail our sins and the bible tells us we must worship god in spirit study not since the catholic more young and in truth there is something about to worship what the way jesus is [Applause] his presence with thanksgiving make a joyful noise unto him with psalms i mean then three rocks for god is a great god a singer amen for our god is a great god our faith have you come with a joyful noise subject yes then you start and if you know how big and great and powerful god is [Applause] [Applause] that is how i worship my god since there's [Music] brothers and sisters when someone is touching this amen but when we come to worship god never treat just sins we must yield our soul truly know where are you we let go everything [Music] and we know that jesus is telling us true worship comes from the heart amen amen a real real change in worship oh my god [Music] be to god many times we don't get breakthrough in worship instead of singing at the top of the line of sins because we don't know how to worship but worship does not begin from the church [Applause] [Applause] praise the lord amen amen and now the time has come it didn't say that amen are you saying that god you are worshipping that that is [Applause] and [Applause] amen you are recognizing the greatness of god or somewhere amen because of what he has done for you already praise be to god jesus when you've got the revelation of worship those things happen automatically praise be to god amen nina i worship all to be with the figure oh because i couldn't yes sir you must do it with figures because god is a living god and where the spirit of god there is liberty in the world amen nina so when we are worshiping god we have to worship god when we are free catholicism where is the lord is left soul and evil spirit took cover amen amen to come and pray instruments amen amen we don't give god only half of worship cattle not the two machines that are cooking to do amen praise be to god come here if god can just help us sing that triangle the other day i was talking i was conversing with one brother i didn't know organic when you're not anywhere talking about worship since the catholic and you realize that in the message somehow worship is a little is lacking and we ought to be the best worshippers [Applause] and we know what we stand for [Applause] i remember [Music] like people who are saved they used to plant them names father two man just because of the way they worship praise be to god i mean [Applause] and god amen man but i'm not worshiping brother i still worship even today but i'm telling the worship they used to do the pentecostals [Applause] god to caesar and a seizure brother will testify a word and i know of judaism that when we are worshipping them something happened what would church say when i was in worship [Applause] us wash cattle to eat until getting sick i also welcome you tonight let us come and let us worship alone since then praise be to god our god is great our god [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] but because the lord is spirit jacob and every morning and his sermon is in spirit and no more doing anymore that's why he happened to see what he saw praise be to god come here amen this coming is not to come to church it is only just mere coming into a building for church praise be to god amen oh coming to me but when you come here [Applause] church as a building nature but god wants us to come to that church christ [Applause] praise be to god so what we need tonight that is the twitter god opening us in the spirit freeing anymore your praise be to god i mean because god is spirit amen and when god calls us catholic to each other i want us to come without hesitation amen i mean when it says come please come back [Applause] just like jesus to be like jesus is true there's no more sincerity [Applause] [Applause] i it says let us take the new testament second team of the chapter 3. the holy spirit warned us that in the last days would you get away from sincerity and the faith they have a form of godliness [Music] that went with that right thing having form of godliness by denying the power that are off yes sir god heads up would you get away from sincerity and the faith symbol praise be to god and when we are talking about the church can we talk about it we are not talking about the building the target of jesus i'm talking about you [Music] [Applause] today that hasn't got christ in it it is powerless said in a man amen i mean is your religion powerful amen amen you are worshiping god but not with the sincerity i don't know my sins and anger your mind is at home at the same time that you are worshipping those [Applause] [Applause] [Music] and when our team scores give me a favor amen amen we don't sit and cross our lines we stand up and we shall let you know can you come back to god you will shout hallelujah praise be to god amen one day when john was in his spirit your kind of animal you praise be to god among us the first players and the joy which you have is said your furnace the bible says see your gamba oh glory be to god come here praise the lord amen when john entered his spirit you're kind of an individual he managed to show what was there what was the son of the child and what was under armour when he saw his name praise be to god amen man what we need tonight it's just to enter in the spirit and when you enter there oh you think you'll be you serious praise me to god amen [Applause] is amen so we cannot manage them when they are in this flesh we ought to enter in spirit and when jesus caused the devil yes yes and you are in the spirit cutting an hour anymore let me tell you those people who watches let they know each and everything they are watching everything brothers [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] yes sir because you know jesus is under if jesus is on the mainland yes the bible tells us in joshua believe yourself i was saying that speaking in joshua 6 verses 20 yes but when they brought the heart of the covenant of the israelites they shouted for they ask [Applause] [Applause] let that man hallelujah dwell in that temple is [Applause] [Music] come on guys i'm still preparing earlier i just can't go quite again i will clean the house around bursts away remove the cobwebs they will even [Applause] they can't even say the captain is coming back praise be to god amen amen jesus is coming back yes is your house clean you there are many things that has been tormenting you what would you do you had many things touching you to and from what would have been better but my brother want to tell you that the presence of god is here jesus wants us by that house yes amen if you can just allow him praise be to god amen hallelujah hallelujah you remember gekkos and elijah nation because garcas was you [Applause] [Applause] speed the same applies to worship not since you start thinking this than that but as you are concentrating neighborhood says that is getting far back you got deep [Music] [Applause] [Music] because the bible says [Applause] [Music] i always tell young brothers god will never matter with a sheep because the love of god in genesis says every seed bear of its own kind [Applause] is however amen i mean god will never bear amen praise be to god that's why we need a real real genuine experience great our government needed for one number because there is where that experience will pass i've been patient with you after
