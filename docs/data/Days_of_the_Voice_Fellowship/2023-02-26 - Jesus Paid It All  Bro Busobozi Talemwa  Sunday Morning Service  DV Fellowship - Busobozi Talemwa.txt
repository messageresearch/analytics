[Music] another summer [Music] time oh Jesus [Music] one more time Jesus is Hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you in the name of the Lord touch your neighbor and tell them God bless you [Music] tell them you're welcome in the house of the Lord [Music] amen how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning coming to me why don't you give the other another clap on the shout of praise [Music] I'm so happy to be in the house of Lord this morning the Lord has done great things in our life [Music] you see I have prepared to sing these songs this morning [Music] that I have I have their lyrics printed on these papers [Music] we sing many songs here in this church some of which we are written by people we don't know but as long as it was inspired by our God then they are our songs how many believe that someone could have been Anglican it could have been respiratorian and then they were inspired to write those songs and then we sing them because of the spirit behind them so now this uh these ones that I was like I felt inspiration to sing were written by a Ugandan singer [Music] and the first time I had them it really really blessed my heart but this morning I'm speaking on Jesus Paid It All and so I just remembered these songs and when brother Peter came here yesterday [Music] he started singing the same songs without even knowing that I was planning to sing them today and so I I I kind of felt maybe that was a confirmation that God wanted us to sing them so we'll sing them to In Worship and I just want you to be a part of the worship for maybe just a few moments before we go into the world and we're happy to see brother Peter and his family this morning amen God bless you Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah amen and we we see we have we have more instruments this morning [Music] you know on Friday let me just give this short testimony before we go to the worship on Friday I was seated in the back seat the back very plastic and Brother Martin was up here on the pulpit and you see and then he was leading us in prayer so I was just connecting with the Holy Spirit and in prayer and foreign at that moment while in prayer the Holy Spirit ministered to me and he spoke these words he says because I had already spoken with brother Shem we had been speaking he has been he had been speaking to me and it has been a burden he was telling me you see we need we need the the drums we need the best guitar we need [Music] and I didn't even want to think about it because it was a lot of money so I always would tell brother Hashem we've not yet reached there we don't need to over stretch we we don't need to strain the church [Music] the Lord will give the grace when we are ready for it [Music] but at that moment the Holy Spirit ministered to me and said buy the drums tomorrow said what I don't have the money I have a lot of debts buy the drums tomorrow it just came and I was like what and I I you know continue to bring for a moment and then I I went out and then I picked my phone and called the gentleman that sells these machines to us and I asked him how much are the drums [Music] I was just asking oh an open question he told me 3.5 million and how about that basic guitar you told me seven hundred thousand and then and then I know he was also demanding me six hundred thousand for the microphones that's 4.1 million so ah said how am I going to do this but one thing that I know is that God does not speak lies it was the voice of the Holy Spirit he had to make a way foreign so I told this man I told him can you bring the drums tomorrow and he said yes Pastor if you have the money I'll bring them and I said bring them I said he said do you have the money I said bring them in house leave the rest to me just bring the drums Saturday morning God made a miracle I had enough money to pay the man and I remained with the debt of 1 million out of 4.1 million and the man brought the drums here by the time I gave the instruction I didn't have an idea on how I would pay by the time the drums reached here I had the funds in my hands do you believe in a God who does miracles so how many years have financial needs [Music] God is going to do a miracle for you do we just believe the word this is part of the word how many believe that so God will do miracles for you amen and if there is a somebody who wants to take that blessing of the remaining one million to pay up the debt you can begin your Miracle by paying that and then God will also open doors for you Hallelujah we serve a god of Miracles we serve a miracle working God how many believe that this morning praise the name of the Lord we believe that with all our hearts amen [Music] I'd like us to Brothers if we can I don't know Brother Martin you have the words for the people yeah if you don't know the words you can I think brother martin has there was let us begin with one that gets her you know it's a thinking about Jesus and how he died on the cross [Music] another you know it's just a wonderful blessed thing to know that we have a savior who died for us so while we sing these songs

hearts father we are so happy [Music] you know that today we can stand completely Justified the devil has no right because of what you have done on the cross and for that we are so grateful this

live again amen [Music] amen Amina while we stand take our Bibles to the book of Romans chapter 8 verse 1. Romans chapter 8 I'm not hearing Bible's opening do you have a Bible you have a Bible say Amen if you don't have a Bible we can give you one but if you can't read luganda please go and buy a Bible [Music] foreign [Music] I want I'd like us to read the first verse together [Music] and then the next verses I will read them let us read it together in English one two three go there I didn't hear nobody reading Selena Gomez I wanted to read it together all right there is there for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit did you hear that maturity for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the love sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who work not after the flesh but after the spirit is foreign [Music] foreign [Music] brother brother I can see you but your seat is right here you missed yourself God bless you Brothers amen I love people who pulled on the water to be close to me so I can be able to preach my heart I'm happy to see you God bless God bless you all I'm happy to see everyone my name is visiting with us you're welcome and I want to give this time now to the world and see what the Holy Spirit has for us so that we can be prepared for the service I I don't know my sound I think you need to give me more sound up here there's a bit of a rebounding so you might need to work on that as well uh where's brother Shem you're always on here and things are always fine so why don't you come and work together with the brother and make sure that everything is working perfectly so this morning I want to speak on Jesus Paid It All [Music] right Jesus Paid It All yes I'd like you to lean on to your neighbor and tell them Jesus Paid him Jesus Paid It all my sister do we believe that there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus Christ is to judge is to sentence is to sentence a guilty person and you condemn them when you were dead to death or you condemn them to something and so this morning I'd like us to speak on that for a few days a few days ago I was away you and you know during that that time you know the Holy Spirit you know brought this thought to me and I was thinking about things and speaking uh to myself about things and I thought Jesus Paid It All ah praise the name of the Lord and really I'm not going to continue until you Brothers make the sound you remove that rebounding because we can't preach in the brother's microphone mine is fine I think amen I hope all of you can hear that needs to be removed so that we can we can have a good atmosphere for I mean foreign because the law has its part that it plays and and it is the law there's a whole process [Music] it's called like a legal process of Prosecuting of all the prosecution of an offender you know we have we have different types of laws but here in Uganda we use the common law and so I'll give you a little bit of a preamble of the common law and how it works I am not a lawyer see but this is common knowledge and I would like you to follow through first of all with this because if you we get this Foundation correctly this Preamble of the summer then we'll be able to understand the whole summer [Music] for the first few moments we all are going to be lawyers in making let us have a low class for a few moments if someone will ask you have you ever been have you ever been in law class you tell them yes at days of the voice so what is the legal process of prosecution of an offender [Music] the first is to investigate on the crime [Music] and the purpose of a criminal investigation is to gather evidence [Music] to identify a suspect and to get a support to arrest them [Music] or someone should not arrest you before they have made an investigation on you [Music] an investigation must be made and after it has been concluded enough information to identify you as a suspect then they arrest you all right so now the investigation is the first process then the second process in this prosecution of an offender is the arrest of assess of a suspect so if they investigate on you to find out whether or not you are an offender then they find saying that there is some incriminating evidence but indeed you are a suspective then the police will arrest you so an artist involves taking a person into custody cut your quiet for the purpose of holding the suspect until the suspect is arraigned to cut your Moon yes then the third process is the prosecution of a criminal defendant they prosecute them they prosecute them like you see one deciding whether to charge a person with a crime is it prosecutors way many factors [Music] including the seriousness of the offense and the strength of the evidence so then this suspect is now A Reign before you see that's the fourth stage before the trial the defendant appears in court and then enters you see when when if they you know they've arrested you and they suspected that you stole something then they bring you before a judge and I think we call it you know the doc the docker foreign [Music] what is your plea where where was that and then there is always two sides of the priest you will say yes I'm guilty oh you will say no I am not you see that is your part to do you accept the accusations amen are you following me so far okay you're good students then the Third that if you if you uh then there is a the the next process or the next day the fifth stage is trial you see no no no trial what's the same adjudication of guilt what's the same with a prosecutor and that under defense attorney uh participating a trial is held before a judge or jury yes you see the standard of evidence for a criminal conviction is guilt [Music] his guilt Beyond reasonable less than 100 certainty but more than high probability if there is doubt based on reason the accused is entitled to be acquitted if there is enough proof that what you are accused oh foreign a judge meets out a sentence gospel sentences include a fine probation a period of incarceration in a correctional institution such as jail or in prison for a given period of time but then when the Judgment has been given that is the end of that case are you following me when a judgment has been given um then you just have to abide by what the judges said but if in any way you feel maybe this judge was not fair and you you you feel you still have a curse to present that the judge did not have before giving you a passing judgment on your case then you go and do what we call appealing so you go to the court of appeals and you file your curse again so that the Judgment can be reversed and then the case will return again to be tried for the trial I mean are you following me all right sister Grace all right now but if in any case you still found guilty and you are sentenced by a judge then you are only going for one thing punishment s do not serve the complete term and are released before the expiration of their maximum sentences release may be obtained by serving the maximum sentence or you might be you might receive an early release now we all as human beings we are made or created in the image of God so the Bible says in the Book of Genesis chapter 1 verse 27. in his own image the image of God created male and female who created so now man was in the image of God are you hearing me man was perfect like God was sinless and so but then something happened when sin came in and the Bible says you see in Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 and the Lord God commanded the man saying foreign [Music] committed foreign foreign [Music] and so the sword of sinneth it shall die remember this is the ultimate sentence there is something I'm trying to build your mind can we say it one more time death death Death was the ultimate sentence I mean did we get that picture together all right I want you to get this properly because in the next few moments I wanted to understand what I want to get to because he was going to attract the ultimate sentence that was the ultimate sentence and Adam was called his baby Adam was a child of God was in the image of God Adam was but I want you to know you can eat everything I will sentence and we all know the story when Adam was out there in the garden and his wife was alone too many [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] but it is originally [Music] you think he did not know foreign [Music] on the word this happened [Music] [Music] he tells you not to eat it because he knew if you eat of it you will be ways [Music] and she did not wait for us Army way what happened there it became silent next time the serpent was out of the picture we are seeing Adam and Eve and Eve was telling others I'm foreign he's the tree of life he said I'm the way the truth the life is a man of life and when we believe in him we begin enjoying the fruits of him hallelujah amen and it brings the characters foreign woman yeah that's what Eve did and then she told Adam you know what Omani yeah tell me about it and the Bible says she gave to him they did the same act back that was introduced but before she came to Adam this is a mystery what you are hearing now you can never hear it in any denominations this is exclusive because it's a revealed mystery because we have a prophet in our generation who came to us with a message that have received the full Revelation hallelujah amen even a doctor theology doesn't know this no massage oh my God I mean and so she came to her husband after this before she came to us she already had a seat [Music] but it was the seed of this yes foreign [Music] [Music] and that's why he did not love his brothers because you were a seed of God hallelujah amen myself but now we know nature because we had the world hallelujah amen the seed of God in you will always say Amen to every word and so I walk the swords that sin amen so who which sold sin we saw the sins that says Adam no one was able to live even for one day the Bible says to God one day is a thousand years and a thousand years to God is one day do we know the longest living man on Earth how many years [Music] how many 969. what was his name [Music] Genesis you see he lived short of the 1000 years which means that same day he was born that same day he died to fulfill the scripture the day you eat of it that day you will die how many I've got it the day you eat of it the day you'll die no man not even Adam yet the Adam lived for more than one day tell you what they know all human beings all the human race has lived for not more than one day no man has ever lived because all of us are born in sinatus the way we are born we are born in a perverted way we were not to be born amen by by the lust of the flesh my knowledge of a man and a woman you know that's not the way children of God are not born like that are you hearing me today are you hearing me children of God my sister we are going to live for more than one day today amen in the millennium how many will be here everybody if you want the world to take you over it's all right so what it was just your life as far as I'm concerned again just start passing through my treasures are laid out somewhere the Angels become me hallelujah amen I am going somewhere there is a land so they can see a fire I am not working for Millions on us I am working for Treasures in Heaven hallelujah amen because I have a seed of God I was born by my mother but I was born again which can never fail this is the same word that is going to take me out of it I am thinking of the Raptors hallelujah amen why do we get up in our souls foreign [Music] foreign questions and the Bible says no condemnation to them that are in Christ who work not after the flesh we are not working according to our natural birth we are working out for the spirit We Are Spiritual Beings that life is God in Christ that's why the Bible says no condemnation hallelujah amen none could be the warrior ideas to redeem himself and others the ultimate price was death um here's the idea according to the law someone had to die in order foreign and there is none of them will be saved none of them will be saved are you hearing me today because none of them can pay the price is too heavy um I know all of them are poor fellows no one is going to pay us like the rich man of this generation foreign [Music] [Applause] stop you don't want to believe it but that's the truth always the rich wins that's why brother don't be poor children and so this devil was like that poor man rich man who came and said I have taken their land they can't redeem it back because they are poor fellows but he did not know that these poor fellows they are the richest goals the whole universe hallelujah amen that the owner the creator of this life was not only their goals because also their father they never did a misconstruation we did not understand that this one is yes it was a very big price Jesus Christ foreign and the scripture says you see even David was crying in the Book of Psalms 51. in verse 3 says please for I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before you realize you don't sin against somebody else you sin against God many people are afraid about people seeing or finding out they are in sins so let me try to protect and hide myself so nobody ever finds out foreign because he is the only one who can save you see he said against thee only have I sinned we could have done this even in thy sight Justified when thou speakers you see Only God can judge us foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] that is a lie foreign [Applause] [Music] otherwise Mary was not the mother of Jesus do I have people who believe that yeah foreign someone is your mother if you are from the egg almost [Music] yet do you understand me it's like a nature the seed of Jesus the Egg of Jesus did not come from Mary and Joseph as Jesus was standing there yes he was God foreign foreign foreign [Music] I mean sometimes I have bad preaching manners praise the name of the Lord and so how when Jesus was standing right there yes who was it it was our savior he was the Our Only Solution resolution is not the pop see papa is not the Catholic church can you preach with me today the solution in our generation the solution to this generation is Jesus Christ [Music] that are going to keep up people and bind them towards the mark of them by the Bride of Jesus Christ has had another sound another voice that's why we are out of denominations that we are preaching came to call us to unite us with Christ he is our Bishop are you not glad you have a wonderful Bishop he's our Archbishop someone asks you who is your pastor Jesus who is your Bishop Jesus yes who is your attribution Jesus yes who is your pope I need Papa Jesus yes are you crazy foreign I've given you this is do you think it was a freelance assistant there were people like you planning for a future for their children foreign [Music] Jesus [Applause] for us to possess Taka [Music] you don't even feel like going I'm telling you those are demons and we are the people of the word of the book a vegetable of the open book I want to say Jesus Paid it oh she is but we have to fight come on we have to fight we have to fight anxiety we have to fight addictions we don't have to accept the devil to start us under his feet we can come up and say never I have no strength let me announce you have no right yes I've been here for a long time this land belongs to me because Jesus say the price you may have been here who is the bar for very many years teen [Music] and there were people there just give it to me let me fight it out I will possess it you see when the spirits come to you the spirits of the world to overcome when you said that you're speaking that there was a language my brother how is it your side [Music] those kind of stuff please you are very depressed I'm not even poor only what is wrong with me so while you are there that's a good language so you mean God has not been here then the devil will say oh you don't even appreciate what God has done yeah I will also include your children you oh brother how are you okay I feel like going crazy [Music] he will he will go on progressing he he will put the high octaves put the drum a little bit how is that code the cake and the music will be so nice and the demons will begin jumping around your home [Applause] and you will be defeated but I've come here today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to tell you I am another angel I am not of the Demons I am from another kingdom and I'll tell me the name of the Lord to you my brother to you my sister hallelujah amen no I feel good now you'll begin to go away my child is going to begin to go away and your child will rise and there will be freedom away we should understand Jesus Yeshua has paid it off yes he has even paid the price of sin yes no sin can bind you no addictions can bind you okay no Wicked forces of evil can overcome foreign foreign [Music] [Music] everything that you was John naturally in Christ before the foundation everything you lost what did you lose When sin came in lost a perfect life a successful life happiness and sickness problems everything that you want to naturally now remember the law of redemption and as we are coming to the close to the end of the service he says in his service you know foreign [Music] and the next thing he had to be an upright man uh adjustment to do it do it your property that you lost [Music] when God saw you he saw you in his mind a perfect man um and so but you didn't you needed a Kingsman and here's the part that I loved he had to be worthy enough money who has the wallet here you help me quality God bless you come on are you worthy enough money I don't know whether I'm allowed to open anyways his wallet a normality had to be worthy enough to be able to redeem [Music] tomorrow brother's wallet doesn't well it's it had to be a worthy enough money you remember what brother Ephraim preached to us she said who is worthy yeah John was weeping there was one of the illness where is this lion it was already dead and the blood was all over no more signs he realized it was the Lambs Jesus Christ his wallet was worthy enough money hallelujah amen and Jesus yes sir that's why you're baptized in his name that's why we bother you if you are not yet baptized in his name is [Music] you have not the Bible says you have not put on Christ you have to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins because his wallet alone so now Boaz represented Christina and then here he says and then he had to make a public testimony that he had done it and then it was his property can you imagine that he can say here that you whatever he redeems it is his property what did Jesus yes God bless you who else is foreign I am his property that's why when we are praying for the sick we have a right to tell the devil sit down take your hands off of God's Property and when the devil hears that stand in my Holiness you know when someone is trying to become a squat on your land if you come with a paper plus here is the proof this is the Land Titles [Music] but Jesus yes whatever he redeemed he is not willing to negotiate with the devil he is not willing to negotiate he only understands one language to tell the devil to walk away from his property when the Israelites were going to Pro to claim their land are they say they're back in the bank God did not tell them go and have treaties with the people of that Land by the way you are seeing what is happening in Palestine now Palestine because of the same thing you know the others are saying it is our land here for ages God gave us this land and the world is saying you can have a treaty a two Nation agreement but this is what he's saying I don't know about that favorites what do we know it is so don't negotiate with your enemy if the enemy is bringing you sickness if the enemies I want to say and declare today we are going to claim and possess what belongs to us hallelujah amen whatever belongs to us to Nature the devil has not right we are his property Romans 8 3 what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned the seed in the flesh foreign [Music] now I want you to look at this verse in the Amplified version and I want you to hold it there I'm not going to actually finish my salmon or cut it off and maybe continue on Wednesday but for now I want you to just hear what it says here in the Amplified version he says for what the law could not do yeah to overcome sin and remove its Penance to remove this power of sins are you hearing me the Lord didn't have that ability to remove the penalties recorded and it has come to an extent is what the works of the law is going to give us salvation sincerely tell me what work of the law can give us a joke did you know that self-righteousness is a sini you know where you come to a moment and sing and feel no to come I'm holier than the other ones because of the way I dress because of the way I work out of the way I talked I'm much better that is self-righteousness the law in itself then he says see it could not it could not he says it could not remove penalty of seeing all the power of sins you see the law in itself so the people who were under the law they were under bonded the they could not remove the power and the pain I remember this moment the man that had done listen listen who did that listen to me I'm pretty lazy this man was a Rich Young Ruler but also he was a religious man from his church can you tell me some of the things he might have done louder oh Brothers you don't know what you you believe yes he would have married one wife come on come on and tell us the what's up good works that believers do that we do that we believe for married people you should have one wife you don't smoke you don't involve yourself in worldly systems I and uh you will behave as a Christian ways you don't cut you know these haircuts don't put on this fittings you are not influenced by the worldly uh Fashions are you dressed don't cut off your hair [Music] no you don't run around with boys you know you always stay in the right place Cola oh oh uh putting on earrings yeah you know those are all foreign [Music] talk to the people you're supposed to talk to in heaven foreign [Music] foreign [Music] just remove your eyes yeah Don't Preach sister okay what else is yes Brother come on what did he say s we don't believe Trinity we want rules yes we have a lot of rules yes that really they're quite many [Music] at this bird now you're quiet because we are not too sure why is Pastor going that direction but here's what I want to tell you the Lord the Bible says the law was righteous because it was given by a righteous God it was given to the unrighteous people and because of that the law in itself did not help them to overcome sins the law in itself did not remove the penalties they did not remove the power of sins because somebody always and whenever they're talking about fornication foreign [Applause] and you're telling that child at 15 years will not help the child if that child a man or at that age kumia cage has not received the character yet and the ability to know that if I go to the Lord I'll be knocked then the law will not happen so you have a lot of people like that who are living in but they are really trying to just abide by the laws of the message you find us people around Parable they are like the richest and Jesus told him yes I've watched and kept but then all these rules but he is some how um that's why he was asking what else can I do it's not about another thing you can do is somebody getting it this young man he needed to understand it wasn't about another thing he can do it wasn't another work s entirely another work somebody else Jesus told him yes okay because if you have done all those Jesus did not tell him yes it's for nothing in fact Jesus told him go and do this but when he realized he has kept them then he brought something else or whatever I'm going to bring now is not for the lock Breakers foreign okay foreign hallelujah amen because of your faith is finished can you imagine that it is that Jesus is not a husband yes you see Miami who is every time looking at his wife but if I said you have done this I'm going to divorce you know ah um and if you do good ones you are my wife foreign because I'm a Child of God I do what I do because of what I am and what Jesus does not make me [Music] [Music] I believe foreign being blessed and some people instead of finding out why don't become jealous what have I not done what they have done socialism God is a socialist no God blesses see who he wants to bless the Bible says listen to the word he is you can never serve God faithfully and it doesn't bless you physically the blessings is going to give us not only heavenly [Music] his presence foreign [Music] he says being weakened by the flesh man is nature without the Holy Spirit okay we're saying for what the law could not do that is overcome sin and remove its penalty its power being weakened by the flesh God did he sent his own son cartoon of sinful man and he condemned the sin in the flesh meaning he subdued it again in the person of his own son away amen you forget these last words then I finish one more time can she demons show me he says what the law could not do because it was weakened In
