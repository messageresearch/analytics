a moment before I forget we please remember to pray for sister praise she traveled to the village is in preparations of seeing someone and so they went to uh in those things with the family amen and so this evening the weather is not here I hope it's online and whoever is not here and online they're missing out yeah that's why we thought we should stream so that the others who are it's usually Miss Friday they can also partake of the services take you know we we labor to football to ensure that you get the food we get the food so imagine that a preacher prepares to preach and then you don't come in the world service loses meaning yeah so that's why your presence here is very important new uh uh this Pulpit is because of you amen God has more for you that's why whenever we we have a service we want to be here there's a brother Michael that is fellowshipping with us for the first time for the Michael and wait for the people God bless you come on he is at KIU okay International University Ali Kampala International University and brother our visitor brother Guma was able to fish him out of there and told him come I'm visiting he's from karamoja also so our church is becoming very close with the caramoji I've noticed that many Brethren when they come from now they are coming to Fellowship here actually Subway we already have like a for now not all of them sadly they aren't here tonight they did not know that because last Friday they had prepared for you but now you did not come back yeah so there's also a sister who was from I think she has gone back she was having internships somewhere here the first time I went to karamoja of course we had gone to try and Institute a translation team try it against [Music] but when I was coming down from uh when we my wife and I were coming back around the time when we were coming back to you to Uganda Uganda I saw in a vision somewhere you know like in the Northern parts God was pointing me there something like that with you brother I did not know that when we return somehow we shall go to karamoja there are many believe us there was telling me one of them the con of the conventions they were preparing they had about almost 7 000 people and all of them believe this message amen and uh that is only the adults not the children are more than ten thousands and God has given us the opportunity to be there I've been there I think Isaac has been there Isaac who else I think those are the only ones have you been there brother okay has not been there and brother martin I think you've also not yeah so uh but before you go to before so you know you go there you cannot understand you because all you have in your head is what you've seen on the news you see you see people who are not having clothes people who are just you know Warriors people [Music] people who live in the manyatas no civilization a lot of poverty people who are ancients that's what we see on the on the news and everywhere foreign is going to matter he will ask them to give him many many accounts but they love the Lord I connected very well with him ever since and so he came for some little fellowship with us I have some uh I will have some time uh with fellowship with him but also tonight we thought that he we should hear from him and he should preach to us I've never had him preach [Music] so let us all get ready for the Lord minister to us it is better when you've never had someone preach because you are expectant we love a lot like you love the Lord when you remember I told you that is a when we were setting up the translation team amen amen so let us sing uh have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power as brother Guma will come to the people [Music] have have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power have washed in the blood of the Lamb oh are you fully trusting in his grace this how are you washed in the blood of the light who are you washed in the blood oh in the salt cleansing blood of the Lamb who are your garments spotless [Music] [Music] [Music] this moment in the groups [Music] [Music] my message [Music] foreign amen [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] yeah yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah yeah [Music] [Music] [Applause] I was happy my soul since [Music] [Music] thank you Jesus thank you Lord cause he always abide me I pray that you continue abiding in me so that when I pass through the narrow gate I'll be there thank you Lord for the leaders amen so as we are still standing let's read in the book of Isaiah is chapter 10 verse 27 yeah I feel like reading two scriptures before we sit down in the book of Isaiah chapter 10 verse 27 vu in that day that is burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder anisio from of thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing I was um the first book of John John chapter 2 verse 27. it's okay foreign but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need note that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and his no lie and even as it have taught you he shall abide in you yes [Music] the blessing on the reading of his wife yeah let us take our seats yeah briefly uh I will bring greetings from my pasta yeah and also the Brethren that knew my coming here and also bring my greetings to you yeah I mean I thank God really for the love that he has put in between me and the pastors so if we say to talk testimonies then we shall not have something from here but tonight yeah as believe as you are saying I think the first day he met me he fell in love with me yeah and even me I fell in there foreign yeah today came with the Michael I thought maybe he will allow someone to move with them again brother Michael also open ING with me so I thank God for that yeah thank you so much Pastor may the Lord bless you so much I pray that that love continues and we be in the other place that God has yeah that I hope he's not the place that God has promised us to be always my prayer that all my beloved friends that love me my prayer is to be with them in that place together yeah also thank really the mother um yeah thank you really for praying uh helping him in prayers and also allowing him to move thank you so much for taking all the matters of the family yeah we have seen the ministers when they get married the wives became a buddy these women don't allow them to go and proclaim the message I always like recently when he was in South Africa America I I watched him when he came this side but after like two or three days or a week again flying over Ethiopia it's not easy jungle may the Lord bless you so much and thank you for that heart yeah let's turn to what we have read yeah briefly we shall look at some texts of the the word really yesterday when I boarded the bus I was also wondering what can I go and say what will I tell the people but there's something there is a scripture that came into my house which is the description let's look at that scripture and I want you to take the text of the message today what will remove nature [Music] Saturday and it shall come to pass in that is that his burden shall be taken away um shall be removed off from thy name shall be destroyed because of the anointing that's what the scripture says we want to know what is and we want to know we are believers we are the message but do you know the burden that you are you know the devil has tied you with foreign foreign [Applause] foreign the flesh is not happy there are three enemies flesh is and because of the flesh the Lord me I'm so happy because he did that I was not going to be safe yes Korea Hallelujah yes that's one great enemy yeah it is a burden to our Salvation amen Amina the second thing is this world that we are living in yeah that's one of the enemies remember what the devil told the Lord Jesus [Music] and because of the things that belong on them because of the glittering things [Music] that's another factor or another thing that always hinders us and see churches so the third one is the master of everything those are the great enemies [Music] but we want to look what will remove but at the last of that scripture says it will be destroyed by the anointing foreign has told us anything which is only be removed it will only be destroyed by that anointing the book of ethical chapter 9 verse 2. so we we are going to look at some people there there were six men together that one of uh among those men there was one man who was dressed with white linen clothes foreign and saying day and night because of the Abomination which is in the world [Music] then later they were instructed everyone without you um in the book of Ephesians chapter do not grieve takes place a change of life will take place because Christ is the Holy Ghost is in you is it the one who lives in you not you living come on foreign are we together oh I'm just making noise are we together are we getting something [Music] Hallelujah man what will he remove and destroyed yoke is by anointing of the world anointing of the world let's give an example when Elijah what God are offended because the children of Israel went back he went to the mountains he wanted to be taken by God but God told him this is there was transformation that took place there was some transformation that took place there was some change that took place in the life of religion there was something that took place in your Elijah's wife but when the Holy Ghost came up what happened to you all of us know the stories [Music] but by the time when the mantle landed on him so he got transformed he got separated he killed all the auctions he kissed themselves their parents then he said let me follow me amen Amina but before that anointing or the Elisha having that leadership in his mind was he having that yeah all the change all the transformation took place after the anointed [Applause] what was the reason why he killed all those Hawks Bros so that when he moves when he first has challenges he will not be remembering when he sleeps hungry he will not recall when he faces a problem he will not recall the animals when the Holy Ghost is seek the Heavenly things about the Heavenly things I'm only those things will happen for that to seek every living where the Holy Ghost is upon us but if it is the flesh the flesh will drive us to think about the worldly things my brother my sister so when that anointing took place there was a great transformation in the Life there was a great change that there is a God in Israel he followed Elijah he followed him he got that double portions he forgot about the world Hallelujah amen amen yes what will remove if you want to escape from this world of confession to rule with the Lord Jesus Christ my brother my sister this is the time for you to seek for the holy spirit because it is the Angel of Death to pass over you um we look at the first Exodus like the movement of Israel from Egypt to the promises when the angel of death came to do something like at the door at the entrance so that when the angel passes amen do we know that story by that time that was used to save the people of that time amen that was the thing is foreign foreign am I saying something hallelujah hallelujah so this is the silver our time without that idea my sister my brother yeah foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah you know when you're anointed you only love righteousness you will love righteousness you will avoid wickedness but you love what oh yeah because the Holy Ghost is foreign and everyone with the Holy Ghost always does the right things amen Amina yes when you have the Holy Ghost you always keep the right thing and you'll do the right things every day that's in the Book of Psalms 105. you can read it from verse 15. that's not my anointed and do not harm to my prophets so we need to be anointed because that's the only thing that will destroy and remove the Earth it is foreign amen Mina save this great message that God has brought us joining unknown region a well-known region making a villager also to say something how great is that love that God passed through his message foreign [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah Amina yeah but when you look when you hear people talk about it you feel not even to reach there is you love the place yeah you love the place you see if I still now Pastor let's go tomorrow I know he has good love with the other side there um he has good love with the camera amen but the anointing which we have received of him amen Amina and you need not any man to teach you when you receive the Holy Ghost you will not need again any man to teach you God's cries with the Holy Ghost is there with you Hallelujah so we need really to seek foreign foreign in one of his sermons but small service but but small like baptism in 1950. if you can't really have that we see what the prophet said about that we see what he says about it and then we see where we are because the Holy Ghost is the only seal that can make us see him amen Amina I don't know whether the brother is there yes as is still looking at that we have also other quotations but I went first to read this one yeah because his son Billy Paul um wanted to go for the ministry but that day he wanted to be anointed amen but the prophet he was too happy when he had his son when you look at the message that he preached that was 1951. it's a bit long somewhere but I want to say something here foreign and in the last three days the Same by you there is going to be two classes of people that there is going to be how many classes and then the other group of people will be having the mark of the business now a question comes which class do you want to belongs do you want to belong in the class of the Seal of the Holy ghosts belong in that class even in this world we have two kingdoms we have one for God the kingdom of God we have also two groups of people the group of the peoples of the devil foreign [Music] by God and they will never see life and they will never see salvation I'm sorry for them because they will go foreign amen Amina we talk of the world endings when the world ends in you see [Music] oh by the time when you die go food day the world has come to an end from here and communication the time when I die in fact the world has come to announcement I pray that before that time comes by the holy ghosts because always are we waiting foreign amen I know many talk about the coming of the Lord my brother you can talk it a thousand and million trillion times let me tell you without the anointing of the Holy Spirit you're wasting your time Hallelujah you are wasting your time even if you preach how many times foreign those putting over a mark there my brother my sister preachers always preach but do you always get marked in that preaching do you always get sealed in that pressure because when they send the slaying Angels when they send those slaying Angel to the city they were instructed repentance [Music] hallelujah hallelujah but this is your opportunity and God is putting seals God is putting ourselves on you you're going to be silly okay God is putting a mark on you my brother my sister hope you'll not be one of them without him because that's what the scripture says maybe let me fly to that scriptures we want to read that and see what they were instructed to do but I want to start from verse 6. Young body mates and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom the mark upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house [Music] not near any man upon whom is the foreign Hallelujah say come not near any man with a mark but before they say destroy heartily or kill actually the old and young children and women and so others those are people without the mask even if you're a child and your parents are here are their Believers of the message what the message better you go and start afresh from the Scripture it does not segregate Bible class [Music] [Applause] remove that sickness will be one of them foreign [Applause] [Music] that's why he promised that I will not leave you until the end of the world is with us every day every house and I believe you will never leave us presence in the Book of Matthew chapter 6 verse righteousness that's the only thing that is [Music] Hallelujah we need to seek foreign let's seek foreign you know she was healed by just the time amen Chase it she seeks the Lord and he had that feeling that one day truly she arrested yes that one day as the scripture says [Music] can God do that also today hallelujah hallelujah yeah that's another sister she suffered for many years but one day only and God changed it was a feeling of seeking for the holy ghosts many people were touching touching the Lord [Music] did not feel anything but when this woman that we have as foreign Hallelujah yeah we need to seek him one day it was just changed the story ended there and the story of healing started from there Hallelujah in my salvation amen I will love doing righteousness because God himself is not in you amen hallelujah hope we are getting something let's let's really try to sing for the Lord you know it is the only thing that will help us at the end of this road foreign foreign Amina yeah we need really him to do something so let's look and see also another example you know when the Holy Ghost comes upon him even if you have been hiding something it will expose it out what happened to him he was there yeah yeah it was a taxi now when the Lord came one day all the things that he [Music] when the Lord comes in your life amen hallelujah hallelujah you will be a new creature because the God who never changes [Applause] welcome back if they are saying go and get maybe a tax of one thousand they say ten thousands but when Christ came that is a great change there was transformation and I pray also but today in my house Let Jesus Christ bring transformation amen Amina yes let the Lord bring transformation abandoned of stealing and cheating even removed can you also can can you also today now it is remove what you have been hiding by that anointing of the Holy Ghost may God help us also today may God also help us today so that we also get transformed we don't know the time no one knows the hours when the Quran comes so that's why we need all the time to be prepared all the time to be ready because you could be sharing here but after this foreign [Music] [Music] foreign we be one of the people that are going to be counting I wanted to manage the number that will enter there what good way amen there is a lot of change when Christ comes into you Christians let's look at our grandmother grandfather that is when they received a promise what happened they became they will take you back foreign [Music] Danny we asked for his anointing amen yeah I'll be grateful when I see all of you in that day yes I'll be so happy to see all of us there whatever dining with it alone but before that time it comes let's Press On let's press let's seek foreign I request I stop there and may the Lord bless you so much yeah so the Lord bless you so much sun as I'm going to invite the pastor here I'm also one of the people who love singing but because of time I was going to teach you one song I want people to study jumping yeah those who are uh bring those things they first leave we use our hands but now because of time yeah as we are concluding [Music] as the pastor comes here we sing that song 150. that when my sins were washed away Happy Days [Music] 150 RP day [Music] oh my God [Music] does [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] when Jesus always [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the door
