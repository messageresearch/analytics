We know that you are the source of our being and we live to you and for you Lord and we are asking oh God that you come and bless us this evening by your word. Bring us closer to you is my prayer as we open the pages of the Holy Ghost. May you open them in our heart that we may hear from above. Use us Lord. We're just of praying but may you use us to speak to your word. Grant it dear Lord in Jesus mighty name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you church. I want to greet you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Shall we open our Bibles to the book of Numbers, chapter 11? And uh we'll just carry on try to carry on from where we stopped on Sunday. It's always a blessing and an honor to speak to the children of God and I trust that um God will minister to our hearts. We are beginning. We will just read that portion just to remind ourselves of the portion we [Music] read 11 in numbers 11:10. Then Moses had the people weep throughout the their families, every man in the in the door of his tent. And the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly. Moses also was displeased. And Moses said unto the the thy unto the Lord, "Wherefore has thou afflicted thy servant, and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layst the burden of all these people upon me? Have I conceived all these people? Have I begotten them that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom? As a nursing father beareth the sacking child um unto the land which thou soest unto their fathers? Whence should I have flesh to give unto all these people? For they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat. I am not able to bear all these people alone because it is too heavy for me. And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight, and let me not see my wretchedness. [Music] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Fore speech. [Music] Amen. You may be seated at church. I just want to uh appreciate all the brothers, the sisters that are here today and especially, you know, we usually have uh the brothers that minister every service, the musicians. Brother Marvin is always very faithful there. And uh by the way there is um one one service here that you know brother Maven has had a dead laptop for a while for years actually which was giving a lot of trouble and when we wanted to project some things it was really disturbing but um one day we mentioned here um And there was someone streaming, a sister who is not even a member of this church, but uh she was moved. I think she occasionally streams our services and she brought a brand new laptop over that for the for the for that uh projection. uh that sister may God bless her and certainly she will see the blessing of God in what she does. Amen. You know sometimes a need is spoken and you know I believe that that's how you know God should provide. Amen. And we appreciate all the media department that work on the camera, the deacons, the music department. Uh I I've also realized we don't usually appreciate our interpreter. How many appreciate our interpreter? Amen. God bless you. And and song leaders and these people are doing a good job. And we really appreciate you know ministry cannot be done u single-handedly you know be it a huge church or small church you need um people that really are committed to the word with ministry it's all about commitment and consistence Because you know the sisters that sing here, God bless you. You know, sometimes you you you don't know uh if someone does something very well and they do it only one time, it doesn't really mean much. But if someone consistently does something then they they are really making impact. Not all the times we come to preach here we feel like preaching. It's a post of duty and we know it's a responsibility that the Lord places on you and it must be accomplished. Not every time you you you come to church, you really feel like coming to church. When you see ah it's service time. You know even when you feel weak and maybe tired or whatever you somehow push yourself. You know why some feel that way is because we are wearing this body. Our soul has the hunger and the thirst and the desire. But our body usually has other plans. But we have to put this flesh under subjection. This evening I'm dealing with I am but a man part two. Uh on a man under divine assignment. We remind oursel of Numbers 11 where God where Moses was speaking with God. You see when when God when when God calls a man as I showed you and demonstrated for you on Sunday, it's not always the man has the ability to do what God has called him to do. It's not always that that man is um fitting the job. Many times that man has no uh [Music] requirements you know or what on Sunday we called qualification. But you see, if God calls you into doing something, you know, God himself will qualify you. And we saw that there are many different ministries callings and you know different gifts administrations you know I've mentioned a few already you know we also went to homes and families being a father being a mother being you know um uh Sunday school Sunday school or media apartment. It's a a responsibility that God has called you to do. Even to be a Christian, to be a believer is a responsibility that God has called you to do. But you see um many times we feel that God has called us to to to dress something that is too big for us. Even being a pastor, I never in my life ever thought I would ever be a pastor. At least I thought that I will be a traveling evangelist, you know, and you know cuz I enjoyed going around and you know starting new things and going here, going there. But when I became a pastor for the first time in Ethiopia, God surprised me and I actually thought I was not qualified for that. people who knew me when they came later in this what you mean you you you've been you've done this you and then you would not even want to say yes because you know surely you do not qualify to accomplish anything you would know that it is you were just there when God was doing it let me tell you When God sets to use you, if it is God using you, you will know it is not you who did it. You were just there when God was doing it. But when you see a man or a woman saying it's me that did it, there is a problem with his calling. They say that God never used him or this man just used, you know, went about trying to exercise his own [Music] abilities. But man's abilities will always fail. But God God is ability in you cannot fail. If he has called you for something to be a father to be a husband to be a wife that cannot fail there are many things that can come about around it to make to look like as if it's going to fail. But Jesus said on this rock I'll be with my child and the gates of hell shall not prevail against. So that simply means the gates of hell will be against you. If you are the church, the gates of hell will be against you. If you are called to do what you're doing to if you want to know you are called by you will see by how the enemy or the gates of hell will open up to try and swallow you and make you go away from your calling. But you see the Bible gave us a promise. Jesus, he say the gates of hell will not prevail against. You see, so whatever responsibility, however difficult it is, whatever assignment, however difficult it is, if it is God who has given it to you, the gates of hell cannot prevail against. And so Moses here found the people weeping. and all their families. Here is a man that God had spoken to. And this man, God told him, "Go to the land of Egypt. I want you to bring my people to a land that I promised Moses. You Moses will do it. I will anoint you to do it. You alone, you are the one who is able to do it." And Moses felt he did not qualify. He gave many excuses. He said I don't have the ability. I I stammer. I I I I am old. I really really really even my training is evaporated and you know my youth is gone. I can't even talk where you can't send me to go and and face an entire army. But you know, God did not mind about the excuses of Moses. God minded about what he thought, not about what Moses thought. So it's not about what you think about yourself. Amen. It's about what God thinks about. He has given you and me a divine assignment. And that divine assignment whether man thinks you can't accomplish whether you think you can accomplish. You see God thinks you can accomplish and you will accomplish it. In the way God has seen fit in the way man has swed fit. The Bible says such are the ways of man. And he says, "Your ways are not my ways. Your thoughts are not my thoughts." He says, "Repent of your ways." So it's not about our ways. It's about his way. And Moses accepted. So when Moses went, God of course told him, I will be with you and I will demonstrate this and I'll do this. So Moses had that confidence. He believed that God would perform miracles. He believed that supernatural things will happen that will qualify his ministry. God has promised preachers and all servants of God in different ministries and calling signs following them. The believer, he says, "All these signs shall follow them. They shall cast out devils. They they shall lay their hands on us and the sick shall recover. They shall you know you know trump serpent. They shall not hurt them. They shall drink poison and it will not hurt them. You know these are supernatural things. But I want you to see something that not all the time these things will happen in our ministry. Not all the time. You know, sometimes God allows there to be [Applause] silence until you sincerely see that I cannot go anywhere that I have stolen. I cannot continue. God promised he will provide. There is no provision. God promised that there will be miracles than one. I don't see them. That's the moment for God to prove his word. You should always aim and rejoice in your heart. Whenever you see things are difficult, whenever you see you don't have an answer, whenever you see you are confused about your calling, that's the moment to say, I am rejoicing in my heart because I know this one thing. God called me. He must come and prove his word. Amen. Because I am under divine assist. I have no ability of my own. I am but a man. I'm just a man. God himself must prove he is God. And that he sent me and he cannot ashame. So Moses came to a point where the children of Israel started you know weeping not crying weeping. Why were they weeping? They were weeping throughout their families young and old and everybody men in their doors and tents and they were weeping because they didn't have meat. They had eaten beans and and whatever so long and well they didn't even have beans. They they had eaten you know these kind of things. I don't know how they call them mana so long and you know like what you would call today beans. You are saying God called you but your children are all eating beans and pork every day every day. every day. Every day until now they all begin complaining until the whole house goes on fire. Now that if you say that God called you, why are we eating beans? Unfortunately, can we have some meat? And and when Moses came and saw what was going on, you know, he realized the Bible says that the God the anger of the Lord was kind. So God was angry. Meaning God does not like his children murmuring. God doesn't want you to mama. He wants you to believe. Even when you have no answer. A believer believes even when they have no answer. That's the difference between an unbeliever and a believer. You know a believer if you want to know whether you a believer or not be in a situation where you have no answer where you can't answer the unbeliever where you can't prove what you believe where you are confused where things are difficult but it is it's loose like your life is going aside you you believe the word but it's not happening. If you are in that situation, congratulations. You can now prove whether you're a believer or not. The believer will stand still no matter what. You remember they said whether whether we die or we live we will not bow. We will not bend. But we know he's more than able to deliver us from the fire. But even if he does not deliver us, we will not bow. We will not. That's how every believer in every age stood. And that's how we are standing today. When things are tough, good, easy, difficult, we stand, we are believers. Tell your neighbor we are believers. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Yes. That's the true gospel. And so we see that Moses was a believer and the people were believers. But the people murmured. And because they murmured, God was angry. And when God became angry, Moses also was displeased. So, so Moses was displeased. He was displeased because people were murmuring, but he was displeased also because God did not come through for him. And he was wondering, why should I be the one to worry? Why should I be worried yet I'm just a servant? Why is God afflicting me with this worry? If I found favor in his sight, why is he laying the burden of all these people upon me? Me only did I conceive them in my womb? Did I give birth to them? Why should I carry them? How should I nurse them all by myself as if I'm the one to suck to give them sucking as a sucking child rather and he was displeased and and then he he came to God and he he began speaking to God. He said, "God, where do you want me to get meat to give all these people? Why do you want me to?" He was praying, but he was angry. You should know your God. You know when if you know God, it doesn't matter how you approach him. He just wants a contrite heart, a broken heart and a contrite spirit. That's what Moses had, but he was displeased. So you can pray when you are displeased and God will hear your prayer. Amen. He came to God and he said, "These people are coming to me. They're weeping. They're saying give us flesh that we may eat. Where will I get it from? I am in a desert. You found me up there doing my own thing. I was a little shepherd. I was satisfied. But you called me. told me, "Go for these people. Now I am here trapped in a desert with them. Where should I take the meat from?" He was he was displeased. And he says, "Okay, if you're dealing with me like this, kill me." He was just a man. You are just a human. You are just a man. But I want to tell you something. God is God. You are just a man, but God is God. Moses had to know one thing. I wish there was someone that reminded him. Moses, you are a man. Yes. But you are a man under divine assignment. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Moses didn't have anyone to remind him. But you have someone to remind you today. And I'm here to remind you, brother, sister, you are a man under divine [Applause] assignment. Cheer up, my brother. Cheer up, my sister. You are under divine assignment. There is the unseen one close to you. There is amen. Hallelujah. power around you that will steer you through the hard times. Only believe and God is God because God is God. He can do what no man can do. So when he had the prayer of Moses, he dispatched help. But all the help you need is still within the realm of your divine assignment. There is no help coming from heaven. There is no angels going to be sent your way. All the help you need is within your divine ascend. All the anointing you need to go through your situation has been blessed upon you. Has been blessed upon you. Oh my you want to know how you see when God came down to Moses and then he said and the Lord said to Moses gather unto me 70 men of the elders of Israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with you. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, never alone. Never alone. He promised never to leave me, you never to leave you alone. Never alone. The person you are standing with in this life is there for a purpose. Amen. God has said, Amen. stand there with him. Oh my let me tell you God told you know Elijah I have go to Zapas I have commanded a widow woman to take care of you. The widow did not even know anything. At the moment Elijah reached there, he was a man under a divine assignment and he was standing with somebody that was there for a purpose. The person you are standing with in your life or it could be your wife, it could be your husband. It could be your pastor. It could be your friend. It could be your brother, your sister. Amen. Let me tell you brother, you could even meet just a friend. These are all blessed there in the realm of your influence by divine assignment. You are not here by accident. You are not here by accident. You are not here by accident. You are not here by accident. Every one of you, you have been blessed here. Amen. Because there's something Amen. That God is doing it is invisible with the eyes of man. But you have to enter into the realm of the spirit. Then you're going to begin to see what no man can see. Hallelujah. Amen. I say you are not alone. Tell your neighbor. Make sure they hear you. Tell them you are not alone. [Applause] You are not alone. You are not alone. Tell them this. I am right here with you. I am blessed here by God to stand with you this hour. You don't need to be depressed. You don't need to worry. Why? Because God has anointed you. But there are people around you that are too to be your helpers. But the anointing to help you is going to come from right from you. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runth over. My cup runth over. Let me tell you by the virtue of the this message of the hour we are anointed. Help my brother give him good sound. We are anointed. We are anointed. We are anointed with a message. Amen. And our cup is running over. The anointing with which we are anointed is running over. Running over. Going where? To our brother next to us. You are next to us and these are our divine helpers and our divine assignment. But he said you will not work alone. God sending angels from heaven. The angels are right here. You are my angel. You are my angel. I am your angel. Amen. Glory. Moses was weeping. But when God came down, he told him, "Okay, you are saying me alone. Me alone, I will help you." But here is the help to 70 men, 70 elders, and then he said, "Now when God when he chose them, he brought them. It is not going to be you to pass the anointing. Listen. Listen. And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take of the spirit which is upon you, and I will put it upon them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you. And you will bear not thyself alone. You will no longer bear it alone. And you will say to the people, "Sanctify yourselves, and you shall eat flesh, for he have wept in the ears of the Lord. Who shall give us the flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt." Therefore, the Lord will give you flesh, and he shall eat. Amen. Hallelujah. The the scripture continues, but let me first stop there. The Lord shall give you flesh and you shall eat. And you shall eat. Amen. I believe that for myself. I believe that for my brother. I believe that for you. You know, when God gave them flesh, God said, "I'll give it to you. You will eat it and you will get tired of it. He said actually it will even go through your nostrils. It will be too much an overflowing blessing. But there's something I want you to see that these people were dispatched. But the anointing was not dispatched from heaven. It will disperse from Moses himself. There is a special anointing in me for my people around me. There is a special anointing in you for the people around me. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. And God dispatches that. Amen. Over to them. For what purpose? That they may help you. bear the burden that you will not bear the burden alone. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Psalms 121. I will lift up my eyes. From where cometh my help, my help cometh from the Lord. He made the heavens and the earth. Amen. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved. that keepeth thee will not slumber. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. My help did not come from the west. My help did not come from the south. Not come from the north. It not come from the east. My help did not come from man. My help come from a black man. From a white man, from a red man. My help will come from the Lord. If God be God, if God be God, he proved himself in generations before us. He proved himself with Moses. He proved himself with William Brana. He must prove himself in our lives. He must prove himself to be a faithful God. And that's why David cried out, "I will lift my eyes out of the hills." Where does my help come from? Where does my help come from? My help cometh from the Lord. And I want to speak to you, my brother, my sister. God will help you. God will help you. Have faith in God. Have faith in God. You better receive than say I have faith in God. Hallelujah. That widow woman had to believe. Why? She was under divine commandment. When God sends you, you are under divine assignment. The person around you. other divine commandments to help you. That's how God helps you. Help comes from the Lord. I will take the spirit which is upon you and I'll put it upon them who helped Moses not the elders. There were others around him and But these were not helping him. They were interrupting him. They were disturbing him. They thought they were anointed. But they were anointed with a different spirit of interruption of disturbing confusing. Let me tell you brother when God anoints somebody around you to support you and encourage you so that you can continue pressing on. We are in a journey my brother. We are pressing on. Encourage your brother. Encourage your sister. Don't be a disruptor. Don't be a discourager. Someone is weak. Lift them up. Encourage them. Pray for them. Encourage them. Pray for them. Invite them to church. There is something you and I can do. Amen. I am but a man. But not just a man divine. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. And brother Bam says in the message Lord show us the father and it suffices us. Don't ever worry if God sends you you just go ahead. You just go ahead. Don't ever worry. Amen. I don't know how I can overemphasize. Don't ever worry. If God sends you, you just go ahead. God will take care of all the rest of you. Maybe you are here tonight and you don't feel like as if you're in church. But I'm telling you, open your spirit. God has a word for you. Don't ever worry. Is God sending you? Did God lead you here? Did God send you here? Where is the message of the hour? Amen. Where might be DVF? But it's more than DVF. It is the message which we are preaching. Did God send you? Did God lead you? Where? Into the ministry that you are doing for the Lord, into that marriage. Amen. into that home where you are there as a child. into that workplace where you are working into that business which you are doing into the interpretation ministry in the music ministry in the preaching ministry whatever God sent you to if God sent you don't you ever worry he will take care of all of you seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all other Tell your neighbor all other things. What is included there, brother? What is inside there? All other things. Everything you need, you might be needing a car. My Amen. Or you might need land. Amen. Like we need land in the church. Maybe you need to buy land for your own. Or maybe you need something else. All other things. It might be healing for your body. Maybe you need a husband and children. All other things will be added. I am reading this because I believe it. All other things will be added. Don't have to worry. God has everything. Come on believers, believe this. I said God has everything. God has everything. God has everything. As I'm preaching to you, I'm preaching to myself. God has everything. I don't have to worry. Amen. He led you. He sent you. He will take care of me. Glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And brother Bam, I read this for you on in the God who is rich in mercy. He says, "I'm not much of a preacher. I don't have education enough to be qualified as a preacher. What is called a preacher in these days when experiences must be a theological experience? It must have a certain doctor's degree. I can't qualify for that." But God seeing my heart I know that I want to do something for him. I want to appreciate it. God seeing my heart seeing your heart. He knows you want to do something for me. Amen. That's why he called you. Now, questions and answers of the Holy Ghost. And this is listen I I said I think this God sent me on the field and I've seen the time where I looked like and I don't have money at all where I did have money at all. Amen. Amen. Our prophet didn't have money at all who is like brother didn't have money at all. Didn't have money at all. Let's not be quiet as if it is a sin not to have money at all. He came to that moment and I would say just pass the collection plate and the manager will come to me and say look here Billy we have $5,000 in the red tonight in the red. Have you got the money in Jeffersonville to pay it? And I would say it's all right. God sent me here or I wouldn't have to come just pass the collection. And before the meeting is over, somebody say, you know, the Lord put on my hand to give $5,000 to this first, be led to do it. Whatever you are doing, are you hearing? Whatever you are doing, be led to do it. If you are pushed into it by man, I can assure you, you will regret and cry. I assure you, but whatever God leads you to, you can never regret. You can never cry. Amen. Amen. Amen. I do not believe in pulling and begging and bombing money. I think it is wrong a wrong thing. Right. Even you, our team leaders, you don't need to beg and b and and pull for money for our land fund. You see, let these people be led. Just remind them, give them a gentle reminder. Oh, we are collecting for this. Praying that God will enable you something. You just pass the collection plate. You don't need to pull and if you don't give, I'm going to remove you from the group. If you don't do that, you're begging and pulling. And a prophet says, "I think it is a wrong thing." Even here in church, we don't say, "If you don't give him, we just pass the plane right now. Brother, if you do it, don't let me hurt your feelings. You might have the right of way from God to do it, but I'm speaking just for myself. I do not believe in it. Now, I've even known of ministers going and this will make you laugh. Says uh it says these churches, it was a big camp meeting and they took the wall afternoon. at a famous denomination, two or three of them together. That's the regular churches like our modern churches here in the city or so forth at a big convention and they took the whole afternoon standing on the platform threatening that God will destroy your crops. God will give your children pium and things like that. If you don't put money into this with this Bible before me, I said it is blasphemy to God and to his followers. If God sends you, he will take care of you. If he hasn't sent you, then let the denomination take care of it. Amen. Amen. I am so glad I can say tonight I am standing here free of denomination. I am standing here free of any. God has sent us with this message of a message restoration. And we are here to say come out of my people. This is a messenger of grace. We are not sent by denomination. We are not controlled by denomination. We are controlled by God. And he said if God sent you, he would take care of you. But if God did not send you, let the denomination take care of you. But if God sends you, he will take care of you. Whatever you are doing for the Lord, if God sent you, I don't want you to worry. God will take care of you. You may not feel qualified for the job. Moses was also felt unqualified. But this is the place that God wanted Moses to be in order for God to use him. God wanted to be the one to qualify Moses. God will qualify you my brother. God will qualify you my brother, my sister. Whatever he has purposed for you, he will qualify you. Always remember you are man or woman under divine. Praise God. Amen. And I want to uh in this 10 minutes to finish now that will make it 1 hour in Judges 6 we read of Gideon and and I will read quickly. And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Medidianites. You can just read it. Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midian. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord. And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Medidionites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, thus saith the Lord God of Israel, and brought you up from Egypt, and brought you up from the house of bondage, and delivered you out of the hand of Egypt, and out of the hand of oppression, and drove them out from before you, and I gave you their land. And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God, fear not the God of the land, in whose land you dwell, but ye have not obeyed my voice because they did not obey God's voice. The Medidianites impoverished them. You know God has also come and he sent us a prophet but people have not obeyed and because they have not obeyed the voice you know medianites have overtaken their life their families their churches their spaces and you know this is what God does is that when he's going to move and do something. He comes to an individual who is [Music] unqualified. And so, and there came an angel of the Lord. Amen. May God send angels in your life. If you want angels to appear to you, put good music in your home. Pray and wait upon the Lord. Read the word med upon it. Angels will show up. And there came an angel of the Lord. And he sat on an oak that pertained unto Josh the Abzite. And his son Gideon threshed wheat by the white to hide it. under the wine uh the the the wine press tried from the medianite. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and he said unto him, "The Lord is with thee." Now, I want you to listen to these words. And when you hear them, ascribe it to you personally. The Lord is with thee. Hear them and see if you can believe it. The Lord is with me. Thou mighty man of Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? Where have we lost? And where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of? Did not the Lord bring us from Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of the Midian. I want to tell you this evening, God has not forsaken. That's why he's speaking to you tonight. You are not here by accident. Amen. He has not forsaken you. God left you alone. God is still interested in you. God is still concerned. God is still on your case. Stop Amen. crying. Quit weeping. Start hearing what the angel is saying. When is the angel speaking? The angel speaking right now. Hallelujah. And the Lord looked upon him and said, "Goon, go in thy might, go in this thy mind. This this thy mind might do you feel the might." You feel weak. But the angel is saying, "This thy might, oh your weakness will be made strain, says the spirit of God. and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Medionite. Have I not sent thee? Have I? The angel says, "Have I not saved?" And he said unto him, "Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I serve Israel? Behold, my family is poor in Manasse, and I am the least in my father's house." You think you are poor? You think you are the least of you think you have nothing in your life. You can accomplish nothing in this life. Open your ears of understanding and listen to what the Lord has said. And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite thou shalt smite the Medidionites as one man. Yes sir. You will smite Israel, the Medidionites as one man. You the one who thinks you are weak. You the one who thinks you are despised. You see no power. You see no future in God is saying to you tonight. I am not preaching. I'm prophesying. God is saying to you tonight, he will use you to smite your enemies. The enemies that have afflicted your family, the enemies that have afflicted your home, your clan, you as one man, you as one woman, God is able to use you. You smite them. You smite them. You smite them. You're going to smite them. You're going to destroy them. You already have the anointing. Believe it in the name of our Lord Jesus. I am anointed to slay my enemy, to slay my sickness, to slay my poverty. The man said is poor. You may be poor. It doesn't matter whether you are poor. Hallelujah. God is faithful. God is faithful. Stand up and begin to say your name. Stand up and begin to slay your enemies. Amen. Close your eyes and see. Slay your enemies of fear. Slay your enemies of sickness. Slay your enemies of poverty. Slay your enemies of unbelief. Believe in the word of God. Believe in the words of the enemy. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. The enemies you see today, you will not see them here. For the Lord is rising up. The Lord is rising upon you in great power, in great grace, to give you your enemies. He's anointing you to smite your enemies. He's anointing you to overcome this year. He's anointing you to live as an overcomer. It doesn't matter how weak you feel. It doesn't matter how sluggish you feel. You may be powerless you think. You may be weak. You think you may be sinful. You think you may be feeble and sick. But listen, listen. God has allowed for you to feel unequalified because he wants to qualify you. He can give you back your strength. He can restore you when you are weak. He can anoint you when you are feeble. He is faithful. He is faithful. He is loving. He is kind. He's compassionate. He understands. And he's here tonight. Receive him in your heart, will you? Thank you, Lord. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Because of your grace and your faithfulness, Lord, Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, oh, thank you Lord Jesus.
