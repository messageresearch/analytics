He knows what is in store. There's something in store. He has gathered us here tonight for a purpose, for a reason. Why don't you speak to him? just have the liberty to just maybe lift up your hand and speak to him and tell him, "Lord, I I just have come here, Lord, to hear from you, to to hear a word from you is enough. You can come down, Lord, and and minister to my heart. And I'm I'm longing. I'm thirsting. I'm I'm longing to hear from you, Lord Jesus. You are everything to me, Lord.

We know that a word from you is enough Lord Jesus to quench a storm. Lord, you are able to come down, Lord, and Amen. minister to each one, Father, according to the needs that they have, both spiritual needs and physical needs.

Lord, Lord Jesus, we want to come before you tonight as we commit this service into your hands, Lord. You brought us, Lord, a a servant of God, a man of God from afar. And we have come under expectation, Lord, for all that you ordained to feed from this ministry in this hour. Lord, I pray that you prepare their hearts. All those under the sound of our voice tonight, both hear the seen and unseen. Lord, Father, I pray that you'll minister to us. We have come expecting to meet a living savior. Take the man of God and put him aside and Lord take that gift in him and Lord that he will minister as he would minister to his people. Lord that he will have the full liberty. We ask this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you saints. Nice to see those uh who have made it so far. Amen. Are you under expectation tonight? Amen. I just want to to say that this was is the doing of the Lord. Actually, I announced that Pastor Simon Peter will be preaching to us on Wednesday. But uh little did I know that actually the ticket I had misread it. He was supposed to be leaving uh last night uh back to New York. Uh but as God had planned it, You know that's brother that's why we're not a denomination you know we believe ABCD and as much as God shall reveal you know so you plan you make your plans make your programs we have programs but also God always has programs so this is the program of God and as I don't know about you but for I am 100% sure that God planned this meeting today and uh he knows what you need. Um just hold it. Be under expectation and that God is going to speak to you. We had wonderful meetings in Karamojido. Um um I had about perhaps 7,000 people or more and uh you know we we did a little alter call after the ministry of pastor Simon I didn't count but probably more just a few thousands I should say you you can see what impact that you know the ministry we had there. We also had some time with the ministers, pastors. I tell you, we had a good time. So, Pastor Simon felt it on his heart and we asked him, but he failed it as well. Extend his ticket. We are not only going to have him today, we also going to have him on Sunday. So hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So uh it's a wonderful it's a blessed week for us. &gt;&gt; We are finishing the year powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. At least even we usually call them the Sunday mail. At least the Sunday mail can also not miss those brethren who don't you know come to midweek at this We'll give you more program after the ministry of the word. For now, we just want to under expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pastor Simon and we are so happy to have you. You know, we first met in Zimbabwe. You remember the meet the meeting I went to? Uh the meetings I went to, dedication meetings. How many remember that? So that's where I met him. I want to tell you it was a divine connection, a divine purpose. We come to love each other very much and he's a senior brother to me and he's been in the ministry for many many more years than I have. And uh I really honor him and we've spent quality time even in fellowship Let me not take the time for the word. We will talk the rest afterwards. Amen. Let us sing Amazing Grace. I've told Pastor Simon to take his liberty, have his liberty and preach as if he's preaching uh to his church back at home. Can you say amen if you agree? A sing grace. Come on, sing with me now. &gt;&gt; How sweet that sound like me. I was lost my Tonight I see &gt;&gt; was great. I don't my heart to raise my Really, how great Are you bow heads in prayer? Gracious heavenly father, we are honored to be here today in your presence. We know in your presence there is life. In your presence there is healing. In your presence, Lord, demons, evil spirits are cast. We thank you for this assembly. We thank you for your servant, the associate ministers, the officers of the church. &gt;&gt; We appreciate you, Lord, for what you're doing. Prophet of God taught us how great things are done in simplicity. We ask that you will come and have your way and your will depending upon you to use us. Help us to get out of the way. May something be said that will be edified. Even if it's just for one soul, it worth all the investment. those who may be on their way coming grant them traveling mercy be with us the rest of the service in Jesus name we pray amen bless you amen uh we like to read the scripture and have you seated get acquainted &gt;&gt; I don't want to keep you standing for long &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 4 vers 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but also who walk in the steps of that faith of our faith. father Abraham, which he had been yet uncircumcised. May God bless the reading of his word. May please take your seat. Amen. We like to greet you all this evening in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Certainly an honor for us to be here. It's my first time in Uganda. I never knew or I would I never had a pull to come here. We've met different preachers from Uganda came to our church. Quite a few of them, but uh invitations have been extended to me. But I had never felt the urge to come the meeting till I met your pastor in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe Ille. I have heard about him for many many years. Sometime brothers in Canada will ask me do you know this brother? used to ask I don't know him but God has a time there are seasons for everything and so this time we met in Zimbabwe we got connected but I didn't know I will come to Uganda so soon we thank God that we are here we've enjoyed our stay in the car London. We enjoy the fellowship of the priest. &gt;&gt; Yes, like you said, I I I'm supposed to have been home today, but God changed the program. So, we thank God. We just follow his leadership. May God bless you. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; The greatest thing that you can be in this time is to be a son and a daughter of God. So this evening want to speak on a subject. It's a small subject. I want to talk about father Abraham. The Paul was writing. He said, "But who also walk in the step of the faith of our father Abraham." So tonight I want to speak on walking in the steps and faith of our father Abraham. Amen. Abraham is the father of our faith. Amen. Uh he walked with God. and his work pleased God. When God was given a promise to Abraham, God gave him the promise. But the promise was not only for Abraham. The promise was to Abraham and his seed. Amen. And so if we are the seed of Abraham, how do we become seed? He said by you know when Christ is that seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you are a child of Abraham. Just for background, God has set in motion laws and principles, tie them to the earth and that cannot or will never change. And uh there are blessings, amen, of God. There are laws of God. There are spiritual laws and there are there are natural laws. There's a law of sewing and reaping. Amen. There are different laws. Now when you apply that law, it will work for you. In the message here he him brother Bham said we are living under our godgiven privileges. God has redeemed us too. So there are privileges. There are blessings. God has redeemed us. The psalist says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul. And all that is within me. Praise his holy name." He said, "Forget not all his benefits. Amen. There are benefits when you serve God. In the message will see Jesus the prophet prophet of God said, "Oh, this is a great hour. I'm so glad to be living here." Moses would have loved to live IN THIS TIME. ALL THE apostles would have liked to have been living in this time. And here we are living in this time and living under our privileges how that God wants to bless his people. Prophet of God is telling us somewhere said this day is a golden day. WE ARE LIVING IN the most glorious hour. Prophets of God, we are looking forward to see this day to live in the season that we are living in so much blessings. But we are living the prophet said we are living under our God-given providence. Blessed be the name of the Lord. In the restoration of the bride tree, God's prophet said, "GOD HAS SET ALL of his laws to serve him, both natural and spiritual. Working according to his word, regardless of the condition." &gt;&gt; I want you TO REMEMBER THAT. REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITIONS. I love that he said I had soak in now. Now I had scripture here on that. I'm sorry. God set all of his laws in motion. Think of it. Let it soak in. Now, as we are coming to a healing service in a few minutes, God set all of his laws into motion. It must work according to his own word. Are you getting it? See, his word, HIS LAWS has to work according to his word. He commanded the son. He commanded the moon. He commanded the earth. He commanded nature. And they all fall right in line. AND ALL THE LAWS WORK in harmony with God's spoken word. And the law of life that is in us will also bring us to a resurrection. It's cattle. It's impossible for it not. Praise the name of the Lord. SO THE PROPHET OF GOD, IF you notice that the laws of God work according to the word, REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITION, blessed be the name OF THE LORD. REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITION in Uganda, REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU FACE, GOD'S LAW CAN STILL WORK FOR YOU. Pray for the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'd like to read the prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the message Elijah, BROTHER BENAM SAID, "BROTHER, I TELL YOU, when a man is really getting hungering and thirsting for God, he will RECEIVE IT." THE TROUBLE OF IT is that the church is not hungry enough tonight for GOD is the reason the Holy Spirit is not moving in the church tonight. That's the reason the signs of the apostle they sometimes say brother Brennham how does the healing and miracle and signs and wondering he said it will work if you believe it. If you will take God at his word it will produce God let me live to prove that around the world that that is true. And so will it work tonight in a drought or anything else? IF YOU'LL MEET God's condition, God will meet you on those grounds. You've got TO COME TO HIS CONDITIONS. Blessed be the name OF THE LORD. THE WORD OF THE LORD, &gt;&gt; THE PROMISES of God will work AT ANY TIME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE TIME OF FAMINE. THAT IS WHY IN THE DAYS OF ELIJAH when the people were languishing, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. THE WORD OF THE LORD WORKED FOR ELIJAH THE PROPHET. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT IS WHY AS BELIEVERS WE ARE NOT LIVING UNDER THE CONDITION OF UGANDA. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT LIVING UNDER THE ECONOMY OF UGANDA BUT WE ARE LIVING UNDER A DIFFERENT ECONOMY. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. TO THEM THAT BELIEVE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. We are connected to another economy. WHEN YOU OBEY THE LAWS OF GOD, ANYTHING, ANY PROMISE ACCORDING TO HIS WORD, IT WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO THE ECONOMY OF HEAVEN. IT WILL OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN. BLESSED be the NAME OF THE LORD. WHEN THE WOMAN W OBEYED the word of THE LORD, SHE opened up a window of blessing. WHILE THE NATION WAS ENTERING AND STARVING, she was feeding and ENJOYING EVIDENCE FROM THE BANK OF HEAVEN. Blessed be the NAME OF THE LORD. OH, MAY GOD HELP US TONIGHT. MAY GOD GIVE US GRACE. So believe God. DON'T LOOK AT YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE. DON'T LOOK AT YOUR SITUATION. DON'T LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE FACING. BELIEVE THE WORD OF THE LORD. WHAT SAID IT WILL WORK FOR YOU UNDER ANY CONDITION. HALLELUJAH. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; In the message reproach for the cause of the word. BROTHER SAID GOD MADE A PROMISE THAT HE WILL bless but THEM BLESSINGS ARE under conditions. YOU'VE GOT TO MEET THOSE CONDITION TO MAKE that work. Are we together? Blessed be the NAME OF THE LORD. GOD PROMISED TO BLESS YOU. BUT THOSE BLESSINGS ARE UNDER CONDITIONS. SALVATION IS FREE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. BUT THE BLESSINGS THAT ACCOMPANY SALVATION, THERE ARE CONDITIONS THAT ARE ATTACHED TO IT. IN ORDER TO BENEFIT, YOU have to meet THE in the message influence 63 SAID ALL PROMISES OF GOD ARE true but they are unconditioned. No matter how fundamentally right we are, WE'VE GOT TO APPROACH IT IN THE RIGHT WAY. NOW, MEN CAN BE FUNDAMENTALLY right and still not receive the blessings of God because it's approached THE WRONG WAY. PROVERBS SAID IT goes on condition. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why even there's a prostitute unbelievers when they hear the word they their faith will rise up to a level and they will receive their healing. And sometime believers will come and they are believers, CHILDREN OF GOD, FAIL TO GET HERE. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHENEVER YOU FULFILL THE CONDITIONS OF THE WORD ON A PROMISE MADE BY GOD, you will GET RESULTS. HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BENHAM SAID, "GOD IS OBLIGATED TO HIS PROMISES." Bam knew Balam, the prophet Bam. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THAT IF I DO THIS AND I do that, God will come to me. He was a gifted man. Praise the name of the Lord. but a false prophet. Remember, gifts and calling of God are without repentance. HE KNEW WHAT TO DO TO GET AN audience from God. Amen. AND WHEN YOU APPROACHED GOD THAT WAY, GOD CAME DOWN and spoke to him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said in exposition of the churches. He said THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ATTEMPT TO OPERATE GIFTS. They will MAKE USE OF A GIFT WHICH HAS A MARGIN OF ERROR IN IT. Then they ask for money and declare the word of God and call it of God. So you can see even in organizations Pentecostal preachers, denominational preachers, THEY CAN TAKE A PROMISE OF GOD'S WORD AND WAVE THAT PROMISE OVER THE CONGREGATION AND the people ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT PORTION OF THE WORD. GOD WILL COME DOWN AND HEAL THEM. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE PROMISE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH MORE ABOUT US AS BELIEVERS? &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHY SAID THE ANGEL OF THE LORD LOVE THY SON ONLY BELIEVE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. AMEN. May God help us. I'm trying to lay a foundation. If I don't finish then Sunday I will I want to take my time. I want you to get what you are saying what I'm saying in the message s will see Jesus SAID AND SO DOES THE BLESSINGS OF THE LAST DAY BELONG TO THIS CHURCH BUT UNDER CONDITION. YOU'VE GOT TO MEET THOSE CONDITIONS. If you don't, you can have all kinds of healing services, shouting services, PRAISING SERVICES, FRUIT SERVICES, SPEAKING IN TONGUE SERVICES, AND IT WILL DO YOU NO good at all. YOU START TO COME TO GOD'S CONDITIONS. WHEN any man or ANY WOMAN MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS of a scriptural promise, then they will reap the benefit of that scripture. BUT STILL THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY are safe. That's right. He was speaking about Israel. The message perseverance say here's where we got the idea. THE LAND of Israel BELONGED TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. GOD GAVE IT TO THEM. BUT THEIR SINS HAD DROVE THEM AWAY FROM IT. THEY THOUGHT BECAUSE THE LAND BELONGED TO THEM and that was all THEY HAD TO HAVE. NO SIR, it's on conditions. ABSOLUTELY. YOU CAN HAVE DIVINE HEALING. YOU CAN HAVE SALVATION. YOU CAN HAVE THE baptism of the Holy Ghost. BUT THAT IS ON CONDITIONS THAT YOU MEET GOD'S CONDITIONS. OUTSIDE OF THAT, IT'S NOT for nobody but believers. Blessed be the name of the Lord. IN THREE KINDS OF BELIEVERS, HE SAID NATURE HAS A LAW. THERE IS A LAW OF NATURE. THERE'S NO WAY AT ALL TO GET AROUND IT. There's no way to get around it. It is a LAW OF NATURE. AND THERE IS A LAW OF THE SPIRIT. AND THERE IS ALSO NO WAY TO GET AROUND THAT. Praise the name of THE LORD. IN MARRIAGE AND DIVORCES, protect the honorest woman in TOWN and the worst man. If they had a baby, it will have to come from the Lord. BECAUSE GOD HAS LAWS SET TOGETHER. AND THIS LAWS LIKE THE SUN TO RISE. YOU PUT a cocker in in a good field, it will GROW AND IT HAS TO GROW BECAUSE IT IS God's law. HALLELUJAH. WHEN SIN IS PLANTED, IT MUST GROW. AND NOTHING CAN GROW LIFE BUT GOD BECAUSE IT OPERATES UNDER HIS LAW. THEREFORE, WHEN THE EVIL SEED WAS PLANTED IN THE WOMB OF EVE, it had TO BRING FORTH BECAUSE IT IS GOD'S LAW OF PRODUCTION AND IT COULD DO NOTHING ELSE BUT BRING IT. It had to it had to come. Are we together? Blessed be the name of THE LORD. SO THERE ARE NATURAL LAWS. &gt;&gt; You see &gt;&gt; science science &gt;&gt; will tell you they will never tell you that they create anything. They will tell you that they discover. That's right. &gt;&gt; IT'S A DISCOVERY. IF THEY DISCOVER THAT MEAN IT WAS ALWAYS THERE. CAN WE SAY AMEN? SAID TELEVISION WAS HERE WHEN ADAM WAS IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. BUT WHEN THIS MAN WILL GO USE THE NATURAL LAWS of physics of mathematics, you'll begin to enter INTO A REALM. BREAK INTO A CERTAIN DIMENSION AND DISCOVER THOSE THINGS THAT WERE ALREADY THERE THAT WAS ALWAYS THERE. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? And they bring it into THIS DIMENSION. THEN WE BEGIN TO ENJOY. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE CELL PHONES AND ALL OF THE THINGS WE ARE USING TODAY. THEY WERE ALWAYS THERE. AMEN. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want us to look at our father Abraham &gt;&gt; and we'll look at some laws tonight and we'll see how the Lord will lead us in Genesis 14. That was when Melisedc appeared to Abraham. The Bible says verse 19, "And he blessed him AND SAID, "BLESSED BE ABRAHAM OF the most high God, POSSESSOR OF HEAVEN and earth." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And blessed BE THE MOST HIGH GOD, which had delivered thine enemies into thine hand. AND HE GAVE HIM TIGHTS of all. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; After Abraham went to war, WHEN HE CONQUERED THE war and as HE WAS GOING BACK, A man appeared TO HIM. MECHISEDC APPEARED to him. CAN WE SAY AMEN? GOD CAME TO HIM IN THE FORM OF MELKISEDC AND MECHISEDC IS THE OFFICE OF A PRIESTHOOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE APPEARED TO ABRAHAM IN THAT MECHISEDC PRIESTHOOD. ABRAHAM BY DIVINE REVELATION. ARE WE TOGETHER? ALL REVEALED TO HIM THAT IF THIS IS THE PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH I MUST PAY TO &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE DID NOT COME TO HIM LIKE HE APPEARED TO JOSHUA AS THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. THE BIBLE WHENEVER THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE DONE GOD WILL ALWAYS EMULATE he will change the form. IF IT IS A TIME TO GO AND FIGHT, HE WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. THE ANGEL OF THE LORD IS THE ANGEL OF ANGELS. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? BECAUSE IT'S A TIME OF WAR TO JOSHUA AS THE CAPTAIN OF THE HORSE. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. BECAUSE JOSHUA WAS A SOLDIER. IT WAS A TIME TO GO TO WAR. NOW APPEARING AS A MIGHTY CONQUEROR, A GREAT WARRIOR. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE WAY HE REVEALED HIMSELF TO JOSHUA. AND THAT REVELATION JOSHUA FAITH. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. HE TOOK AWAY ALL THE FEAR. HE KNEW THAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WAS LEADING THE BATTLE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE CAME TO ABRAHAM, HE CAME TO HIM IN THE FORM OF WHEN ABRAHAM SAW HIM SAY, "OH, THIS IS THE PRIEST." CAN WE SAY AMEN? SAY THE PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH. AND ABRAHAM struck Revelation. If this is the PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH, I MUST PRAY TIGHT. CAN WE say amen? Blessed be the name of &gt;&gt; How did he introduce himself? &gt;&gt; In verse 19, it said, "And he blessed him, blessed be Abraham, most high God, POSSESSOR OF THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH." Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM GOT THE REVELATION. THAT THIS MAN THAT APPEARED TO HIM, GOD CAME TO HIM IN THE FORM OF A PRIEST. ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT THIS MAN IS THE POSSESSOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO IF IS THE POSSESSION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH COME TO THE REALIZATION THAT WHATEVER HE GETS WHATEVER BLESSING YOU HAVE IS COMING FROM THIS MAN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND SO SINCE HE HAS BLESSED ME, I'M GOING TO PAY TITHE TO HIM. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see tithing did not start in the law. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Tithing, paying tithe started before even Moses was born. SO WE SEE AS God the same God appeared to Abraham will now introduce this to the church in the wilderness. When you go to farm God has blessed your farm. God has blessed your word. Amen. You must take one. Amen. Belongs to God. That's right. The law of sewing and reaping came before the law of Moses in Genesis after the flood. God was speaking to Noah. He said, "While the earth remainth, seed time AND HARVEST TIME, COLD AND HEAT, COLD AND HEAT, SUMMER AND WINTER, marriage shall not cease. TITHING DID NOT BEGIN during the law. EXISTED BEFORE THE COMMANDMENTS WERE GIVEN." HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO THAT IS WHY ABRAHAM, &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. was driven by divine revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cain and brother said they pay tithe. That's right. &gt;&gt; IN A MESSAGE EARNESTLY CONTENDING for the faith. He say YOU MIGHT BE A GOOD BAPTIST BOY. I know you. Let's get down right to the showdown. Now if fundamentalism IS RIGHT, GOD SHOULD NEVER REFUSE BAM'S OFFERING. If if fundamentalism is right, I SHOULD NEVER HAVE REJECTED CAIN. KANE WAS JUST AS RELIGIOUS AS ABRAHAM. He made a offering. HE WENT TO CHURCH. HE PAID HIS TITHE. HE BUILT AN ALTAR. HE WAS SINCERE. SO THE PROPHET OF GOD IS SHOWING US THAT CAIN AND ABEL WERE PAYING TITHES AND OFFERINGS TO GOD. BUT YOU SEE, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE do that is not tied to our salvation. That's right. BUT IT GIVES YOU ACCESS TO the blessings of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Salvation is an unmmerited favor. WHEN ABRAHAM GAVE TI TO MECHISEDC, he did not read IT IN ANY BOOK WHEN HE CAME TO HIM BY INSPIRATION BY divine revelation. SOMETIMES OR MANY TIMES WE WILL RECEIVE BLESSINGS FROM GOD BUT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN THOSE BLESSINGS SECURE THEM. AMEN BECAUSE WE DON'T ENSURE THOSE BLESSINGS. Can we say amen? When you buy a car, I don't know how much it work in here in in Uganda in the west where we live. Do not even register your car until you have an insurance. We insure our cars. You have to ensure your home is insured. Why do you PUT INSURANCE? INSURANCE IS A FORM OF PROTECTION. WHEN YOU PURCHASE SOMETHING IN CASE OF ANYTHING HAPPEN, INSURANCE CAN WILL GIVE YOU BACK THE MONEY. MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE to buy a car. Amen. &gt;&gt; THE INSURANCE TO YOUR salary is the 10. Hallelujah. THE &gt;&gt; IT IS THE 10% that protects the 90%. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Are you with me? Let me prove it to you by yourself. In Malachi 3:8, I know this is not new just for the purpose of the thought. God was saying, "WILL A MAN ROB GOD YET? YOU HAVE ROBBED ME." BUT YOU SAY, "WHEREIN HAVE WE ROBBED THEE?" IN TITHES AND OFFERINGS. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS SPEAKING TO THE CHURCH. GOD WAS COMPLAINING. YOU SAY, YOU ASK, "WELL, CAN HOW CAN A MAN ROB GOD? GOD IS IN HEAVEN. WE ARE ON EARTH. HOW CAN WE STEAL FROM GOD?" CAN WE SAY AMEN? YOU KNOW, A ROBBER IS MORE DANGEROUS than an ordinary thief. SO THOSE WHO ARE NOT PAYING THEIR TITHES AND OFFERINGS, GOD call them robbers. Then he said, "YOU ARE CURSED WITH A CURSE, FOR YE HAVE ROBBED ME, EVEN THIS whole nation. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU DON'T PAY YOUR TITHE AND YOU DON'T PAY YOUR OFFERINGS, YOU MUST REMEMBER YOU ARE THE SEED OF ABRAHAM. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WALKING IN THE STEPS AND FAITH OF OUR FATHER ABRAHAM? HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SO IF WE ARE THE SEED OF ABRAHAM, EVERY SEED WILL BRING FORTH OF HIS TIME. IT WILL BE A STRUGGLE. IT WILL BE A PROBLEM. SO A SEED OF ABRAHAM TO BAPTIZE AN OFFERING. That's right. But you see when we talk about offerings sometime we just think in the in the terms of money but we'll show to you maybe on Sunday That is more than that. Oh my. Oh my. That's right. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "BRING YE ALL THE TITHES TO THE storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now, not tomorrow, SAY THE LORD OF HOSTS, IF I WILL NOT OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN, AND POUR OUT A BLESSING, BUT THERE SHALL NOT BE ROOM ENOUGH TO RECEIVE IT. CAN WE SAY AMEN? SO HERE, BROTHER SAID, THE PROMISES OF GOD. THEY WALK ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD. THERE is a law. ARE WE TOGETHER? IF YOU WANT GOD TO BLESS YOU, IF YOU WANT GOD TO PROSPER YOU, CAN I SAY AMEN? GOD IS SAYING TRY ME. GOD IS THROWING A CHALLENGE REGARDLESS OF YOUR CONDITION REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE. If you are MAKING ONE SHIELDING AND YOU TAKE ONE CENT, GO AND TRY ME AND SEE IF I WILL NOT OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN, BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. SO I DON'T CARE HOW SMALL YOU MAY BE. I DON'T CARE HOW LITTLE THAT YOU HAVE. IF YOU APPLY THIS LAW, GOD IS GOING TO BLESS YOU. GOD IS NOT A LIAR. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD TO LIE. GOD IS THROWING A CHALLENGE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BLESSED BE THE NAME of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Walking in the steps and faith of OUR FATHER ABRAHAM. GOD SAID IF YOU IF YOU BRING YOUR TITHE, IF YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR OFFERING, I GOD WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS to heaven. I WILL OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN. AND WHEN I'M BLESSING YOU, ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; I WILL GIVE YOU BLESSINGS AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE enough room. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE COME TO FULL OBEDIENCE, WHEN WE APPLY THAT LAW, you will see what happened. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will show you a scripture. Let me just put it. You know when Abraham left his country he left almost he didn't come out with very great substance maybe few animals he left the country but as he was applying those laws of God the Bible says that Abraham was A VERY RICH CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOSPEL OF PROSPERITY. That's what I'm talking about. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; BUT THERE ARE LAWS IN THE WORD OF GOD AND IS SUPPOSED TO BENEFIT YOU. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAY WE ARE LIVING UNDER OUR PRIVILEGES. WHEN YOU TAKE A PORTION OF THE WORK AND YOU APPLY IT IN YOUR LIFE, YOU WILL SEE RESULTS. &gt;&gt; God says, "I will rebuke the divorce." Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is he rebuking the divor? because you have insured. Can you SAY AMEN? IF YOU ARE A FARMER, GOD WILL REBUKE. HALLELUJAH. THE THINGS THAT WILL DESTROY YOUR FARM. IF YOU ARE A BUSINESSMAN, GOD WILL PROTECT YOUR BUSINESS BECAUSE YOUR BUSINESS HAVE BEEN INSURED BY TITHING AND OFFERING. CAN WE SAY AMEN? BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. GOD IS SAYING I GOD WILL REBUKE THE DEVOURING &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR SAKE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND HE SHALL NOT DESTROY THE FRUITS OF YOUR GROUND. Your ground could be anywhere. Your ground MAY BE A BUSINESS. YOUR ACCOUNT MAY BE YOUR JOB. Your account may be whatever you own OR YOU ARE DOING. ARE we together? &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SO WE AS children of God you KNOW &gt;&gt; when God want to do things he can do it regardless of the numbers. Sometimes it just take one man. &gt;&gt; It only took a Moses with faith. WHAT IS FAITH? Faith is a REVELATION of the will of God. Faith is a revelation the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then he said &gt;&gt; in verse 12, &gt;&gt; he said 11, I re I rebuke the divor. HE SHALL NOT DESTROY THE FRUITS OF YOUR NEITHER SHALL YOUR VINE CAST HER FRUIT before the time in the field. Lord of hosts AND ALL NATIONS SHALL call you blessed. &gt;&gt; You shall be delightsome. You shall be a delightsome land. When you are obeying the word of God, people will see the blessing. How are they making it? Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; The blessings are there. &gt;&gt; The money that you need for the building is there. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of everything is already there. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE THAT CAN BREAK INTO THE REALM. AMEN. THE CURRENCY THAT YOU NEED IS FAITH. FAITH IS A CHANNEL THAT YOU BREAK INTO. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND BRING THE MONEY &gt;&gt; AND YOU MANIFEST. HALLELUJAH. IT'S ALREADY THERE. THE BUILDING IS THERE. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOUR FAITH CAN RISE TO THE LORD, IT DOES. YOU DON'T NEED A MILLIONAIRE HERE. GOD, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO DO IT. GOD WANTS YOU TO DO BELIEVE HIS WORD. APPLY THE LAWS OF GOD. AND WHEN YOU APPLY THE WORD OF GOD, GOD IS A GOD OF MIRACLES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let me bypass some things here. Jesus even when he came he identified tithing as a part of thing a believer does. The only problem with the Pharisees pay putting too much emphasis. ON TITHING. THEY WERE NOT preaching salvation. When Abraham paid tithe to &gt;&gt; Melised, the priest of the most highc did not receive the tithe did not refuse the tithe. Sorry. He receive it because he knew that he was going to bless Abraham. Tithing is a law of giving. It's a law of seed ti. When you are paying your tithe, you are not paying it to the pastor. is God. Even if the pastor is a millionaire, it's not your business. Can you say amen? YOU DO IT SO THAT GOD CAN BLESS YOU. YOU ARE NOT DOING IT FOR HIM. PEOPLE CAN COME WITH THE IDEA SOMETIME TO the pastor. I'M MAKING HIM VERY RICH. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; You are doing what God told you to do. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Ecclesiastes 11:1, "CAST THY BREAD UPON THE WATERS, AND THOU SHALT FIND IT AFTER MANY DAYS." JESUS SAID in Luke 6:38, "KEEP AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU GOOD MEASURE, PRESS, SHAKING TOGETHER, RUNNING OVER MEN GIVE into your bosom. And with the same MEASURE THAT YOU MET WITH ALL, IT SHALL BE MEASURED TO YOU AGAIN. ARE WE TOGETHER? JESUS IS SHOWING US A LOVE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. DON'T ALWAYS BE ON THE RECEIVING END. WHEN YOU GIVE, IT SHALL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE MORE YOU GIVE, THE MORE GOD WILL BLESS YOU. IF YOU GIVE LITTLE, GOD WILL BLESS YOU LATER. THE MORE YOU GIVE, THE MORE GOD BLESSES YOU. AMEN. IT IS A LAW OF GOD. IT MUST COME TO US BY REVELATION. I AM TELLING YOU, MY BROTHERS, MY SISTERS, IF YOU BELIEVE, IF YOU APPLY WHAT I AM TELLING YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF JESUS AND BY THE NEXT NEXT TIME WHEN I COME, SOME OF YOU MAY BE MANAGERS BLESS SOME OF YOU. GOD WILL RAISE YOU. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE WORD OF THE LORD. LOOK, HALLELUJAH. THIS IS NOT PROSPERITY GOSPEL. WE NEED TO TELL YOU DON'T TELL YOU RUB OFF OF YOUR BLESSING. Can I say amen? LOOK AT WHAT GOD TOLD JOSHUA. HE TOLD JOSHUA. HE SAID, "MY SERVANT MOSES IS DEAD." CAN YOU SAY AMEN? HE SAID, "BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO, THE BOOK OF THE LAW, EQUAL THE BOOK OF THE LAW, BECAUSE THESE ARE THE LAWS OF GOD. CAN YOU SAY AMEN, LET IT NOT DEPART FROM YOU, MEDITATE UPON IT, DAY AND NIGHT?" HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU DO THAT, HE SAID YOU WILL PROSPER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO IF YOU WANT PROSPERITY SPIRITUALLY, &gt;&gt; PHYSICALLY, MEDITATE UPON THE WORD, MEDITATE UPON THE WORD SHALL BE FRESH. &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND ALL OTHER THINGS SHALL BE ADDED UNTO YOU. PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. MAY GOD HELP US. G. &gt;&gt; SO THE WORD OF GOD SAYS, "GIVE AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we don't know these things. I seen when I'm driving sometimes to uh maybe somebody want to pass and I give them way somebody may want to make a left you you give them when I see when I do that when I find myself maybe a day or two in the same CONDITION and give me SAY AMEN. I TAKE NOTE OF THOSE THINGS ARE LOSS OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. THAT IS WHY I'M SAYING DON'T BE NEGATIVE. Always be positive. say good THINGS ABOUT YOU. WHEN YOU SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT SOMEBODY, SOMEBODY WILL SAY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. After the flood, Noah gave an offering to God. And God was so happy and he said this to Noah. The Bible says in Genesis 8:20, "And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord, and took every clean beast, every clean foul, offered burnt offerings on earth." That was before the Lord. Verse 21. And the Lord smelled a sweet sav. And the Lord said in his heart, "I WILL NOT AGAIN CROSS THE GROUND ANYMORE FOR THIS. FOR THE IMAGINATIONS OF MAN'S HEART IS EVIL, neither will I against smite anymore every living thing I have. NOAH &gt;&gt; GIVEN AN OFFERING TO GOD MADE GOD MAKE A COVENANT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Are you HEARING ME? SO WHEN WE ARE MAKING OFFERINGS SOMETIMES WE are overlooking these things. THAT THESE ARE SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLES. THEN GOD SAID IN VERSE 28, I READ THE SCRIPTURE. I read it earlier. THEY SAY WHILE THE EARTH REMAINTH WHEN YOU SOW SEED TIME AND THERE IS GOING TO BE A HARVEST time he said it will not se this ordinance WILL REMAIN AS LONG AS THE EARTH REMAIN. WHY? BECAUSE PROPHET NOAH GAVE GOD AN OFFERING THAT MADE GOD HAPPY. THE BIBLE SAYS GOD WAS HAPPY IN HIS HEART. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH, WE SHOULD DO THINGS THAT WILL PLEASE GOD. DO THINGS THAT PLEASES GOD. I WILL SAY AMEN. WHEN GOD IS HAPPY, GOD WILL BLESS YOU. GOD WILL OPEN DOORS. GOD WILL MAKE A WAY FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHATEVER YOU DO IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD, YOU ARE NOT DOING IT FOR THE PASTOR. YOU ARE DOING IT FOR JESUS. YOU ARE DOING IT UNTO THE LORD. THE BIBLE SAYS, WHATEVER YOU DO, DO IT AS UNTO THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND WHEN YOU SERVE GOD THAT WAY, not grudgingly, AND YOU ARE HAPPY COMING TO CHURCH, YOU ARE HAPPY GIVING THE OFFERING. IT IS AN OFFERING YOU ARE GIVING. COME AND SAY AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN YOU DO IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART, IT WILL MAKE GOD VERY HAPPY IN THE NAME OF THE LORD. AND GOD WILL SPEAK TO YOU. GOD WILL BEGIN TO BLESS YOU. TO MAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD BE PRAISED. &gt;&gt; He said while the earth remainth because of this offering Noah has given them. I will not destroy man again. There will be a time to harvest. &gt;&gt; God was even showing now the economic systems of the kingdom run in the law. If we don't have food to eat, if there is drought, people will die. Yes. If we don't have food to eat, if the rain doesn't come on the sea and there will be a drought, people will die. But God said, "Noah has offered this offering under inspiration." Amen. &gt;&gt; God says will not cease. &gt;&gt; If you want a seed of goodness, you have to sow a seed of goodness. That's why there's a law of sewing and reaping. In the kingdom of God, every time you give, whether your time, coming to church, giving offering, giving, you are sewing seeds, you are like a farmer planting. Hallelujah. And young brothers, do you know what brotherham said? He said the way you serve God now. It will have an impression upon your children. Hallelujah. Can we say amen? You don't realize our actions can be seen. When Abraham paid tithe, Levi was not there. LEVI WAS IN THE LOW OF ABRAHAM FOR THAT ACTION OF ABRAHAM SAID while he was in the Lord. ARE YOU HEARING ME? BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO. YOU DO MAY AFFECT YOUR CHILDREN TO COME good or bad. GOD SAID, "YOU WILL VISIT THE INIQUITY OF THE PARENTS UPON THE CHILDREN DOWN TO THE FOURTH GENERATION." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT? WHAT THE PARENTS HAVE DONE IS GOING TO BE VISITED UPON THE CHILDREN UPON THEMSELVES. RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL BE VISITED. HALLELUJAH. EVIL IS ALSO VISITED. ACTIONS ARE SAT. Praise the NAME OF THE LORD. MAY GOD HELP US. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 9:6. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "But this I say, "He which swearingly shall also reap. He which swe bountifully shall reap also bounty. Then he said, "Every man according as he purpose in his heart, let him give, NOT GRUDGINGLY OR OF A NECESSITY. FOR GOD LOVETH A CHEERFUL GIVER." Can we say amen? WHEN YOU ARE GIVING SOMETHING TO GOD, YOU ARE offering something, GOD wants you FOR HIM TO ACCEPT THAT OFFERING THAT COME FROM THE HEART. CAN I SAY AMEN? YOU ARE RAISING FUNDS. You are raising funds for the building. Think about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If that building is built to work, &gt;&gt; a sinner come from the street and he's saved, SOMEBODY IS HEALED, SOMEBODY'S DELIVERED. DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT WILL BE ATTRIBUTED TO YOU? CAN I SAY AMEN? BECAUSE SOMEBODY SACRIFICED AND GOD WILL NOT LEAVE YOU UNDONE. CAN I SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; MAY GOD INSPIRE YOU TO KNOW THAT WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING, THE SACRIFICES THAT YOU ARE MAKING, IT IS NOT IN VAIN. GOD IS WATCHING EVERYTHING, LET IT COME FROM YOUR HEART. Don't do it. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE MORE YOU DO IT IN THAT now sometimes when you ARE SOWING A SEED IT DOESN'T COME UP RIGHT AWAY. You plant A SEED. Sometime it's as if nothing happens. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE YOU HAVE SHOWN THAT SEED UNDER THE GROUND THERE IS A LAW. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A LAW IN THE SEED. EVEN THE SEED HAS A LAW OF LIFE. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID, "MY WORD IS A SEED." &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TAKE A SEED OF GOD'S WORD, WHEN YOU TAKE A PROMISE OF GOD'S WORD, THERE IS A LAW. THERE ARE BLESSINGS. SAY, "AMEN. THERE'S POWER WITHIN OUR SEAT. YOU MAY NOT SEE TODAY. YOU DON'T SEE IT TOMORROW BUT AT THE RIGHT TIME SEED WILL GERMINATE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. IT BEGIN TO GROW. PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. THE BIBLE SAYS YOUR LABOR IS NOT IN VAIN IN THE LORD. That shall he also. Hallelujah. Glor. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; God love a charful giver. It's not how big the offering is. How little it is. when they are bringing it. &gt;&gt; I can't preach all of this message. I took serious on this subject a lot of people. May God help us. May God give us grace. Paul knew these laws in Galatians 6:2. He said, "BE NOT DECEIVED, God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man seth, that shall he also." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID IN GENESIS 1:11, "EVERY SEED BRING FORTH of his kind." Amen. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; was speaking to Israel. &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord came to the prophet saying, "Is it time for you, oh ye that dwell in sealed houses, and this house lie waste? NOW THEREFORE, THUS SAY THE LORD OF HOSTS, CONSIDER YOUR WAYS. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE WERE HAVING NICE HOME. BUT THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WAS NOT TAKEN CARE OF. GOD WAS SAYING, "YOU HAVE A NICE HOME. YOU HAVE GOOD THINGS GOD HAS GIVEN TO YOU. THEY SAY IS IT IS IT FAIR ENOUGH? IS IT FAIR THAT THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WILL BE IN THIS KIND OF CONDITION? Consider your ways. He said you have sown MUCH BUT bring in little. You eat but you have not enough. YOU DRINK, BUT YOU ARE NOT FILLED WITH DRINK. YOU CLOTHE BUT THERE IS NONE WARM. And he that WEDGES AND WEDGES TO PUT IT INTO A BAG WITH HOLES. Are you with me? IN OTHER WORDS, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PAYING THEIR OFFERING, THEY WERE NOT PAYING THEIR OFFERINGS, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH BUILDING WHEN OTHER BROTHERS ARE SACRIFICING. You you act smart. You act smart. You try to, you know, pay. Can we SAY AMEN? BUT GOD SEES EVERYTHING. HE KNOWS WHO IS GIVEN. JUST EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO. BLESS THE NAME OF THE LORD. I SAID GOD IS SAYING TO THEM, YOU WORK and work, you get money, but the money will just when you get your money, &gt;&gt; it's just like you have money and you put it in a pocket or bag that has holes. You know when you obey the word of God, God say was saying even to Israel, he rebuke the devil diseases that was should have struck you that will make you to GO TO HOSPITAL AND SPEND THOUSANDS OF YEARS WILL NOT COME UPON YOU. HALLELUJAH. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; GOD WILL WATCH OVER YOUR HOUSE. GOD WILL WATCH OVER YOUR BUSINESS. GOD WILL WATCH OVER YOUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN SURE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. BUT THESE PEOPLE SAY you you make you you THINK WORK YOU MAKE A LOT OF SALARY BUT YOU don't know where THE MONEY GOES AT THE END OF THE DAY. SO GOD IS REPEATING HIMSELF. GOD SAID, "THE LORD OF HOST, CONSIDER YOUR WAYS, GO UP TO THE MOUNTAIN, &gt;&gt; BRING WOOD, AND BUILD A HOUSE, AND I WILL TAKE PLEASURE IN IT, AND I WILL BE GLORIFIED, SAY THE LORD." CAN I SAY, "AMEN." &gt;&gt; GO TO THE MOUNTAINS. GO AND CUT THE WOOD. BRING THE PLYWOOD AND BRING IT TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. AND WHEN YOU BUILD MY HOUSE, GOD IS SAYING, I GOD, I WILL BE HAPPY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND WHEN GOD IS HAPPY, WHEN YOU FIND FAVOR WITH GOD AND THE BLESSINGS WILL FALL DOWN, GOD WILL OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN. HALLELUJAH. GOD WILL PROMOTE YOU. AT A PLACE OF WORK. WHEN YOU LOSE A JOB, GOD WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER JOB. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. THAT'S THE WORD OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; He said, "You look for much, but it came little when you brought it home. said the Lord of hosts, "BECAUSE OF MY HOUSE that is west, and you everyone run to your own house. THEREFORE, THE HEAVEN OVER YOU stayed from you AND THE EARTH IS STAYED FROM her foot." Can we say amen? They were farmers. You know, may God help us to be obedient when obey God. You are you are doing it for yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; See what God is saying. He said, "I call for a drought &gt;&gt; upon the land, upon the mountains, upon the corn, &gt;&gt; and upon the new wine, upon the oil, upon that which THE GROUND BRINGETH FORTH, UPON MEN, UPON CATTLE, UPON ALL THE LABOR of your hands." GOD IS THE POSSESSOR. CAN WE SAY AMEN OF HEAVEN AND EARTHL WHEN HE APPEARED TO ABRAHAM? &gt;&gt; HE SAID, ABRAHAM, I AM THE POSSESSOR OF THE HEAVEN AND EARTH. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT GOD OWN EVERYTHING. CAN YOU SAY GOD OWNS EVERYTHING? IN THE END TIME BECAUSE THE SEED OF ABRAHAM IS HERE. MECHISEDC, &gt;&gt; KING MECHISEDC &gt;&gt; CAME DOWN IN THE END TIME. CAN WE SAY AMEN SAID TO PROVE THAT HE'S HERE? TURNING MY BACK TO ALL THE CONGREGATION TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SAME MECH CAME TO ABRAHAM IS HERE RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A SISTER OVER THERE IN A RED DRESS SO AND SO THEY HAVE SO THEY HAVE SUCH SUCH PROBLEM THE LORD. WHAT WAS HE DOING? IT WAS PROVEN TO US THAT &gt;&gt; MELISEDC HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE MIGHTY ANGEL &gt;&gt; THE POSSESSION &gt;&gt; OF HEAVEN &gt;&gt; AND EARTH &gt;&gt; IS HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO THE SEED OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; HE PREACH A MESSAGE. HE SAY WHO IS THIS MESSAGE? DID NOT SAY WHO WAS, HE SAID WHO IS PRESENT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. HE'S HERE WITH THE PROMISE. HE'S HERE WITH THE PROMISE. THE MIGHTY ANGEL HAS COME DOWN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HE PUT ONE FEET, ONE FOOT UPON THE SEA, ONE FOOT UPON THE EARTH. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S A POWER THAT CAME FROM THE SEA. THERE'S A POWER AROSE FROM THE EARTH. FOOTPRINTS MEAN POSSESSION. HALLELUJAH. YOU ARE THE SEED OF ABRAHAM. THE SEED OF ABRAHAM SHALL POSSESS THE DEATH OF THE ENEMY. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; TO THEM THAT BELIEVE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. GOD BLESS YOU. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DO WE BELIEVE? STAND UP ON YOUR FEET AND praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. We shall possess the gates of our enemies. IS THAT THE WORD? DO YOU BELIEVE THE WORD? WILL YOU DO THE WORD? DO YOU BELIEVE THE WORD? AND his promise SHALL COME BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT LIE. EVERYTHING HE SAYS, HE FULFILLS IT. AND REMEMBER, GOD CHOOSES A MAN FOR A SEASON, FOR A MOMENT. GOD KNEW WHAT WE NEEDED. GOD KNEW WHAT WE NEEDED. AND THIS MAN WAS NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. BUT GOD TOLD HIM, YOU CANNOT MOVE. THIS IS THE TIME. THESE PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR THIS. I TELL YOU, CHURCH, THIS MUST BE GONE. WE DIDN'T PLAN THIS. GOD PLANNED THIS. AMEN. I AM MORE RESOLVED TO WALK IN THIS WORLD. AMEN. Because God is preparing TO FULFILL HIS PROMISE. YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS THE VISION. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY ARE CATCHING THE VISION? &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. COME ON. PRAISE the Lord. With a clap offering with a shout, &gt;&gt; with a glory. Hallelujah. Oh, as musicians come. Oh, praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Isn't he wonderful, sir? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he loves us. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHAT WE NEED WHEN WE NEED IT. And he KNOWS HOW TO CHOOSE. A MAN THAT can minister to our need. Oh, praise the Lord. Thank you, Pastor Simon, for yielding us. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, &gt;&gt; this is just the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you want to be the first to arrive here on Sunday morning. Be the first to arrive here on Sunday. You remember what I told you about the widow with a cruise of oil and what will happen if she kept powering in powering in is indeed what the Lord told us all. This is a man all the way from New York. He wasn't here when God was speaking to us. I said that must be God. That must be God. To those of you who walked in late, please go to the beginning of this sermon and watch it to everyone. Amen. For the Lord has visited us today. Oh, thank you Lord. Shall we sing a little chorus? Reach out. Ask the Lord as he goes by.

Help me to walk in your ways. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, I bless your name, Lord.

Oh, thank you, Jesus. That's his truth and it is his mercy to us tonight, his grace to us tonight, his love for us to minister to us. Such a mighty voice of his word to us. We say thank you Lord. Oh thank you Lord Jesus. Amen. I need truth. Hallelujah. Give me true mercy and love so that I may dwell in your praise. Give me truth mercy and love. &gt;&gt; Give me truth. Hallelujah.

Mercy and life so that I may dwell. Hallelujah. In your presence keep me true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see. Amen. Amen. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; it's it's the narrow way, but it's your way. We know that Lord, all those that are in you can never be lost. But Lord, many of us live under privilege for all the blessings that you have prepared for us. Many times, Lord, we want to be receivers and not givers. Lord, we are saved. We are going to heaven. But many of us, Lord, remain bound in these things. And we remain beggy. We remain expecting others to give to us, expecting others to make it for us. The Lord told us tonight, the God of Abraham is our God. We are sons of Abraham by faith and the blessing of Abraham must be applied to us also. We claim it tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. Help us Lord to walk in that. Give us the revelation Lord. For faith is a revelation of your will and Lord your ways and your will never change. But many times Lord we lose focus on impress these things upon each heart these principles of your word took a surrendered heart all the way from New York. He sacrificed a lot to be here just for us to hear this and there is more for us on Saturday. Take the man of God and re kindle that fire in him renew his strength and let all all of us and and others who are not here Lord come back more expectant. Lord desire us to hear from you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. We ask your blessing upon the congregation now even as we will dismiss shortly Lord. Father bless everyone and even now as we are going to practice what we have heard by giving our offerings and tithes Lord. Bless every giver that we give. Apply your word upon them. Lord be with us as we shall go to our homes. Give us a wonderful week, &gt;&gt; wonderful weekend in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Before we give our offerings and dismiss, I just wanted to uh maybe you can have your seats for just a moment. Just wanted to uh give a few announcements. Uh but how many appreciate the word we have had tonight? Amen. Amen. It looks like you've been uh listening to everything we've been talking about over the past several months. That can only be God. Isn't it interesting when you hear someone else come say what your pastor has been saying but in a different even in a better way? that has been a very big encouragement to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a service I have someone I preached on sewing uh the principle of sewing. And after I preached it, I was like, did I just preach that? I had to just send it to a few friends to ask them, please check it and tell me if I'm still in the message. But if I had had this sermon tonight, I would not have asked anybody about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we say amen to what we have heard again? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, tomorrow is Christmas and uh so I know um many have already traveled and maybe others would want to go with their families and what have you. But I just wanted to remind you that as you plan to be with your family, biological family, we also have a family &gt;&gt; of believers. Some of us really when we came into the message the family of believers became more of our family than the other family. you want to spend much of the holidays with the believers and so we don't have a church program for tomorrow but uh I'll have pastor Simon at my house tomorrow and so I've not invited anyone and unless if you are uh you know you know family member &gt;&gt; allow us also to share that and the rest of you can also share with your I think you can say amen to that. But I appreciate those have already received some Christmas gifts. It's been lovely to those of you who did that. God bless you. We certainly appreciate you very very much. And um but on on sat on Friday early very early in the morning we are planning to drive to Sono. &gt;&gt; There's a convention there. Uh pastor Makoba has been in uh in Pastor Simon's church several times. Where is charity? Charity &gt;&gt; right over here. &gt;&gt; So that's your friend's daughter. So uh we will be you know pastor Makob has invited us to go and you know it was these things were not planned really so but we we'll just go there and in at least a meeting or two where we will have our brother preach there and then we we drive back immediately. You see all those sacrifices all for you because we're planning for him to be here on the weekend. Otherwise, they would have been very happy having him there the whole time. He was even invited to be in the meetings in which he could not make because of the meetings in Karamoja &gt;&gt; but also because of you. Imagine. Think about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so you really want to be here and on time. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, Friday will be in Sorco. Then on Saturday, we're going to be here at the church, um, with the ministers and their wives and also those who don't have wives. If you know you're a minister in this church, uh, and those of you who are not here, you are streaming, please make sure you no matter where you are, come and be here. And when I say ministers, I don't mean only the preachers, you know. I mean even those ministering in other departments, those serving as deacons and you know uh media department and music department and all those departments uh Sunday school all of you come and be and of course the preachers as well uh because you see when we have ministry come through like uh pastor Simon Peterimon is uh you want to tap from you want to tap So that's why I do things like that and that service will not be streamed. If you minister and you don't make it, you will miss. Then on Sunday morning, we will be here. So for Saturday because we are going to be traveling from Sorco and we'll be tired for the ministers. We will not do Sunday morning. We will do it at around um I guess about 2 p.m. Yeah, that uh 2 p.m. I think um we will communicate on the on the group to see if you want to put it a bit earlier with then on Sunday morning we will all be here. Uh don't come alone. Uh I know last Sunday I was told that and I know there are very many who were not here. But I was told that uh if there was one more person, the chairs were not going to be enough. &gt;&gt; So uh there's a a sister among us here who pledged to buy chairs for the church. So you have had a sermon on giving tonight. So I hope that God you you would want to ask for more blessings for more chairs or maybe there's someone else who want to take you know when you talk about giving not many amens come especially when it's the pastors talking about when you have a a visiting minister talk about everybody says amen but we say amen anyhow. And uh so Sunday morning we'll be here at usual 10 a.m. Please keep time. We want to give the word as much time as possible. Really as the pastor was preaching I I thought to myself I wish we had a Sunday up evening but then we have already given it to another church. How many thought it would have been lovely to have a Sunday evening? So you come early in the morning. Let's utilize our Sunday morning very well and Sunday evening he'll be preaching over at Pastor Bima's and uh you know so we want to be there Sunday evening. Lastly 31st I know we did not announce this early but I told you I gave you a heads up. I told you that I would announce this So 31st we have our usual New Year's program. We have always been at my place but we will be here because even I think last year we were here also. Yeah. It is going to be a Wednesday. So our we will begin with an evening service which will also be a communion and foot washing service. That's on Wednesday 31st. So, just be here, of course, by our normal time, 5:00 p.m. And, uh, we will be here throughout the night. I should have I was expected to hear shouts and claps and everything cuz I know you all love that very much. Yeah. So, we're going to be here 31st. Um and uh we will have prepare your those who have testimonies and and I know there I had many who had have testimonies and you know what the Lord has done for you throughout the year and uh we had also those who have been very consistent give us towards the land fund and you know they had testimonies to encourage the people so we can also prepare those will be here throughout the night on God bless you.
