[1:09:42] another clap
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:46] of you may be seated for just a few
[1:09:50] moments. Um, our Fridays are usually
[1:09:54] special days.
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:58] because we come for a prayer meeting.
[1:10:02] Uh many times when brother Bham talks
[1:10:05] about a prayer meeting really they went
[1:10:06] to hear the word and to
[1:10:13] fellowship and so and also have some
[1:10:16] time for
[1:10:17] prayer and it's a it's a blessing for
[1:10:21] brethren to dwell
[1:10:24] together in
[1:10:27] unity. Amen.
[1:10:30] uh that we can spend some time in the
[1:10:32] presence of God.
[1:10:35] So uh is Sister Joyce here tonight?
[1:10:41] No. Okay. She's she's not here. Uh
[1:10:45] probably she she might come on Sunday.
[1:10:49] Just had a testimony to tell you there.
[1:10:55] All right. So uh with with us we have
[1:10:57] brother Amram.
[1:11:02] Amen. Brother, can you stand?
[1:11:07] Amen. Praise the
[1:11:11] Lord. We had a successful
[1:11:14] surgery and we appreciate all of you for
[1:11:17] praying
[1:11:19] for uh that surgery was working on one
[1:11:23] of his eye the eyes.
[1:11:29] Um but uh the right
[1:11:34] eye also need another surgery which is
[1:11:36] going to be more expensive
[1:11:42] uh which will probably uh take place
[1:11:44] maybe in
[1:11:46] Nairobi after a while. That is the
[1:11:48] report from his
[1:11:51] dad. So we just believe with
[1:11:55] him that the Lord will help him to carry
[1:11:57] the
[1:11:59] cross. And um you know friends sometimes
[1:12:02] I think about the place where we are
[1:12:07] headed. Our true
[1:12:10] origin is not this world.
[1:12:13] You know this world is full of
[1:12:17] toils, full of
[1:12:19] cares, full of trials and
[1:12:21] suffering, tests and
[1:12:24] temptations. But there is a
[1:12:26] world that is much better than this
[1:12:29] one. And uh when we get over
[1:12:33] there, there will not be a
[1:12:35] There will not be a blind
[1:12:38] man or
[1:12:40] woman. There will not be a sick person.
[1:12:44] There will not be anyone in
[1:12:46] pain. There will just be
[1:12:49] joy. After all the victory is
[1:12:54] gone, there won't even be a poor
[1:12:57] man. Many of our friends have already
[1:12:59] gone before
[1:13:01] us and they are
[1:13:05] waiting for our change of body.
[1:13:09] Then we can join
[1:13:10] them and forever we shall be with
[1:13:13] him. You know many times when we go
[1:13:16] through things in this
[1:13:18] life, let us be
[1:13:20] encouraged and know that our God is
[1:13:23] faithful. Amen. Our God is
[1:13:28] faithful. Brother, do we have the
[1:13:30] visitor today? No. Okay. All right. So
[1:13:33] um this evening or this night whichever

[1:14:00] expectation that the Lord will use him
[1:14:03] for us tonight.
[1:14:05] Amen. So we pray for him uh and also we
[1:14:09] pray for

[1:14:13] us. Uh we will have two sessions, two
[1:14:16] services like we did last Sunday, last
[1:14:19] Friday.

[1:14:27] one. So um we are going to have the same
[1:14:30] thing
[1:14:32] today and we have someone another some
[1:14:35] special

[1:14:44] brother brother polycap's
[1:14:47] ministry and those of you who come to
[1:14:49] the home sale here
[1:14:52] again he ministered there and uh man the
[1:14:55] man that young man has something in him.

[1:15:01] but we know that God has
[1:15:04] something he has for the bride through
[1:15:07] him in the future.
[1:15:11] If you have not heard Polica
[1:15:13] preach, you you just pray and and that

[1:24:48] And when he was gone forth into the
[1:24:53] way, there came one one running and
[1:24:57] knelt to him and asked him, "Good
[1:25:01] master, what shall I do that I may
[1:25:04] inherit eternal life?"
[1:25:07] And Jesus said unto
[1:25:09] him, Why callst thou me good? There is
[1:25:14] none good, but one, that is God. Thou
[1:25:19] knowest the
[1:25:20] commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do
[1:25:24] not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear
[1:25:28] false
[1:25:29] witness. Defraud not. Honor thy father
[1:25:33] and mother. and and he answered and said
[1:25:36] unto him, "Master, all these have I
[1:25:41] observed from my youth." Then Jesus
[1:25:45] beholding him loved him. And he said
[1:25:48] unto him, "One thing thou
[1:25:51] lackest. Go thy way, sell whatever thou
[1:25:56] ha
[1:25:57] has, and give to the poor, and thou
[1:26:01] shalt have treasure in heaven, and come
[1:26:04] take up the cross, and follow me."

[1:26:23] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign
[1:26:24] speech.
[1:26:52] Yes.
[1:27:08] We shall also read in the the book of
[1:27:10] Luke chapter 14 verse 20
[1:27:16] 27 to
[1:27:21] 29. Luke chapter 14
[1:27:24] verse 27- 29.
[1:27:28] [Music]
[1:27:36] And whosoever doth not bear his cross
[1:27:40] and come after me cannot be my disciple.
[1:27:45] For which of you intending to build a
[1:27:48] tower? Situs known down fast and count
[1:27:52] the cost whether he he has he have
[1:27:57] sufficient to finish it. Least happily
[1:28:01] after he has laid the foundation and it
[1:28:04] is not able to finish it. All that
[1:28:07] behold
[1:28:09] it all that behold it begin to mock
[1:28:15] him.
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:25] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign
[1:28:26] speech.
[1:28:54] Amina, you can have your
[1:28:57] seats. May the word of of the Lord be
[1:29:01] blessed. How many are happy to be here?
[1:29:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah. We thank
[1:29:08] the Lord once again.
[1:29:11] Yeah. The little message that I have
[1:29:12] this night,
[1:29:15] it is
[1:29:19] investments.
[1:29:21] Investment. Brother Brham preached about
[1:29:25] it like five
[1:29:28] times. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:34] So may God give us
[1:29:36] grace that we may receive more about
[1:29:41] it. Amen. Amen. As we have read in the
[1:29:45] book of
[1:29:47] Mark 10 verse
[1:29:50] 17, we see this rich young
[1:29:54] ruler coming to
[1:29:57] Jesus asking him, good
[1:30:01] master, what can I
[1:30:03] do like to inherit eternal
[1:30:07] life? Amen. Amen.
[1:30:11] If you read
[1:30:13] well, this young
[1:30:17] ruler was a
[1:30:19] Christian was like one of you. One like
[1:30:22] you or and
[1:30:25] me. He also attended
[1:30:28] church. He knew that the
[1:30:31] commandments. Amen. Amen. But what did
[1:30:34] what difference did he see on Jesus
[1:30:36] Christ?
[1:30:39] From his uh like his
[1:30:46] priest because he he learned this from
[1:30:49] the
[1:30:51] synagogue but he saw
[1:30:54] Jesus and he saw something
[1:30:57] different. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:31:04] And when Jesus presented to him what he
[1:31:09] wanted and became tougher.
[1:31:13] Amen. Some of us
[1:31:15] here when things get tough, when the
[1:31:19] word gets
[1:31:21] deeper, brother, I'm saying that how
[1:31:24] shall we give you like the hard things
[1:31:27] when you cannot take them the ABCD?
[1:31:33] There's a time when you'll take the
[1:31:37] milk and when you take the the real
[1:31:41] meat. Amen. Amen. That also happens to
[1:31:45] the word of
[1:31:47] God. When this man was given me
[1:31:52] eternal life, part of eternal
[1:31:56] life which were all of us seeking
[1:32:02] for amen. Is there anyone searching for
[1:32:05] another
[1:32:06] thing? We are all looking for eternal
[1:32:09] life. We all seeking
[1:32:11] it and God is more ready to give it to
[1:32:16] us. Amina. Amen.
[1:32:19] But when it was presented to this young
[1:32:21] ruler,
[1:32:25] he rejected it. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:32] Jesus gave him an
[1:32:36] investment that will last
[1:32:41] internally. But he saw his possessions
[1:32:44] so high that the internal
[1:32:49] life and that's what is happening also
[1:32:55] here like to the business life to the
[1:32:58] business
[1:33:01] community when you're signing like an
[1:33:04] agreement or a
[1:33:08] contract you some essential things they
[1:33:12] Alway you always
[1:33:15] consider you you consider an
[1:33:19] offer
[1:33:21] acceptance and
[1:33:26] consideration consideration like the
[1:33:29] value the value
[1:33:32] of why you take
[1:33:36] it. Amen. We are given an
[1:33:40] offer of eternal
[1:33:43] life. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:46] In God's
[1:33:48] economy, we are given an
[1:33:51] offer. Amen. Amen. It's it is up to us
[1:33:55] to take
[1:33:56] it and accept it and consider it as
[1:34:00] something
[1:34:02] valuable. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:10] So I'm also presenting it to you
[1:34:14] now. Amen. Amen. There's a a quote
[1:34:21] brother. He was talking about the you
[1:34:24] was
[1:34:25] asked you always around
[1:34:30] businessmen. Are you a businessman?
[1:34:34] He said, "Yes, I'm a
[1:34:36] businessman." And the wife looked at
[1:34:40] him, brother. Said, "Brother in the
[1:34:43] heart?"
[1:34:47] But he said, "Yes, I'm a
[1:34:51] businessman." Then they asked him, "What
[1:34:53] do you
[1:34:54] do?" I do life
[1:35:00] insurance. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:35:03] He He gave life insurance and
[1:35:12] assurance. Hallelujah. So I'm also
[1:35:15] presenting to
[1:35:16] you this eternal
[1:35:19] life. Amen. Amen. As an
[1:35:22] insurance. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm
[1:35:25] presenting it to you so that it can save
[1:35:28] you. We make
[1:35:31] investments so that they can help us in
[1:35:35] future. We see very many people have
[1:35:38] made investments in the
[1:35:40] Bible that have helped
[1:35:43] them. We see
[1:35:45] Razaras and that rich man
[1:35:49] Razaras made an investment in God's
[1:35:52] word.
[1:35:55] He obeyed God's
[1:35:57] word and he had an investment that saved
[1:35:59] his
[1:36:02] life. There is also an investment right
[1:36:06] here that you can subscribe
[1:36:09] to and get yourself eternal
[1:36:13] life. Hallelujah. Amen. This is the only
[1:36:19] policy. Hallelujah. The word of
[1:36:23] God. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:27] Just take it, my friend.
[1:36:32] Hallelujah. It will do you
[1:36:35] good. Amen. Amen. Take it all all of
[1:36:41] it. Don't make a partial investment and
[1:36:44] then you you expect something
[1:36:47] big. Give in yourself.
[1:36:51] Don't be like this rich young
[1:36:54] ruler. You obey the ten
[1:36:57] commandments. He was a good
[1:37:00] Christian. You see, even the way he
[1:37:03] approached
[1:37:04] Jesus, it showed he was a good
[1:37:07] Christian. Amen. You may also be a good
[1:37:11] Christian. You may have made investments
[1:37:13] in different things in
[1:37:15] church. Hallelujah. Amen. But there's
[1:37:18] this
[1:37:21] personal personal personal thing that
[1:37:24] you have to to really invest
[1:37:28] in that it will take
[1:37:31] you as a
[1:37:35] person.
[1:37:37] Hallelujah. To accept that internal
[1:37:42] life. Amen. Amen. It is the investment
[1:37:45] I'm presenting to you.
[1:37:49] Hallelujah. Let us read. Dear
[1:37:52] God, but there there must have been
[1:37:55] something about
[1:37:58] Jesus that attracted that that attracted
[1:38:01] his
[1:38:03] attention different from what he had
[1:38:05] been used to in the synagogue.
[1:38:09] What we preachers always tell you
[1:38:16] in different churches where
[1:38:19] people they they
[1:38:21] speak but there's a
[1:38:24] difference with the word with a servant
[1:38:26] with the word of
[1:38:29] God with living this word in your
[1:38:32] life. Brother said in one of his
[1:38:37] sermons, "You better leave me a sermon
[1:38:39] than preaching it to
[1:38:44] me." Amen. Jesus preached a
[1:38:49] sermon through his
[1:38:51] life. Amen.
[1:38:55] Amen. And the the rich young saw a
[1:39:01] difference. He saw this man would lead
[1:39:04] him to get eternal
[1:39:07] life.
[1:39:09] Amen. Everything is now
[1:39:12] here. Everything to to earn you eternal
[1:39:15] life is now
[1:39:17] here. Amen. It is now
[1:39:23] here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Make a
[1:39:27] right investment.
[1:39:29] Hallelujah.
[1:39:32] The rich young ruler
[1:39:33] saw saw the possessions were so big
[1:39:37] giving them leaving
[1:39:41] them and he ended up losing an
[1:39:46] opportunity. Don't lose an opportunity
[1:39:48] this
[1:39:51] night. I'm presenting to you a a
[1:39:54] lifetime
[1:39:58] investment that will save you even when
[1:40:01] you're
[1:40:03] dying. It saved Razarus when he was
[1:40:09] dying. But this lifetime
[1:40:14] investment sometimes it is time
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:19] testing. We seen
[1:40:23] Noah, he also made an
[1:40:25] investment. Aina,
[1:40:28] he believed God's
[1:40:30] word. He believed even what was people
[1:40:33] have never heard
[1:40:35] of. Amen.
[1:40:40] He believed what people had. People may
[1:40:42] have not even ever heard of rain or rain
[1:40:45] coming from up or water coming from
[1:40:49] up. But he
[1:40:51] believed to the devil. It was a fact
[1:40:54] that what has never been like that. It
[1:40:57] has never
[1:40:58] happened. But it was the truth because
[1:41:00] it was the word of God.
[1:41:04] Amen. This investment that you're
[1:41:06] making, it is the truth. Amen. It will
[1:41:11] save your life.
[1:41:13] Hallelujah.
[1:41:17] Amen. Look to what was presented to this
[1:41:20] young
[1:41:21] ruler. Thou shall have treasure in
[1:41:26] heaven. Aina,
[1:41:30] we have always made business
[1:41:34] that have us different
[1:41:37] things. But friends, I want to call you
[1:41:39] to do this
[1:41:42] business. This business of God's
[1:41:45] word, I mean business with God's
[1:41:50] word and you'll have
[1:41:55] treasures. No man does a
[1:41:57] business that is non trusted. You cannot
[1:42:01] invest your money in something that is
[1:42:02] not trusting.
[1:42:06] Can you just give some person some your
[1:42:10] money because he has something in
[1:42:12] apolitan that if you take it you'll uh
[1:42:14] you'll find there some some gold or what
[1:42:17] you've not checked and you just give out
[1:42:19] your whole your
[1:42:27] lifetime. That's what people are doing.
[1:42:33] Amen. May God just help
[1:42:36] us. God has presented to
[1:42:39] us an
[1:42:42] investment. An
[1:42:45] investment. An
[1:42:47] investment.
[1:42:48] Hallelujah. That will save your
[1:42:51] life. It has saved very
[1:42:54] many. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:00] It saved the three
[1:43:04] Hebrews. Do you know? Do you know just
[1:43:06] giving in your life and going into the
[1:43:09] fire? Just walking, walking,
[1:43:12] walking, reaching at a
[1:43:15] point. The men reached at a point. He
[1:43:18] said, "If this fires kill
[1:43:21] me, let it
[1:43:24] kill." They were sure in the investment
[1:43:26] they made.
[1:43:29] I just want you to be very
[1:43:31] sure of the investment you're
[1:43:35] making. Is it a life-saving
[1:43:39] investment? Is what you're doing saving
[1:43:41] your
[1:43:44] life? Amen. Amen.
[1:43:52] Sometimes we miss
[1:43:54] out because of petty
[1:44:00] things just petty
[1:44:02] things. I want to read you this
[1:44:05] quote. So
[1:44:07] businessmen
[1:44:09] remember prosperity does not always mean
[1:44:12] that you are a Christian.
[1:44:17] The devil, you know,
[1:44:22] David, I believe one time he's saying,
[1:44:25] "I seen the wicked spread forth like a
[1:44:28] green bar a green a green b
[1:44:34] tree." But God said, "Did you ever
[1:44:36] behold him at the
[1:44:41] age?" That's the difference.
[1:44:44] Look at the end of the
[1:44:48] road. Is your
[1:44:54] investment going to take you up to the
[1:44:58] end? Will it save
[1:45:00] you? Amen. Will it save
[1:45:04] you? Amen. Amen. Sometimes we focus on
[1:45:08] other
[1:45:09] things and live out the internal
[1:45:12] life. We mine on the we go and put our
[1:45:18] minds on on minor
[1:45:21] things. Give the major
[1:45:23] things. Amen. It's good to give. It's
[1:45:28] good to be rich. I also want to be
[1:45:31] rich. Amen. Amen. But the word of God
[1:45:35] says, "Seek first my
[1:45:38] righteousness. I'll add to you all other
[1:45:40] things. I know you need to drink. I know
[1:45:44] you need to to dress."
[1:45:52] God's investment comes as a full
[1:45:56] package. The word of God says, "Have you
[1:45:59] ever seen the children of God sleeping
[1:46:01] out?
[1:46:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:07] Friends, make a right
[1:46:11] investment. Invest in God's
[1:46:14] word. Invest for eternal
[1:46:17] life. Amen. Amen. That will save
[1:46:22] you. Amen. Amen. Don't go on
[1:46:27] gambling. You gamble with life.
[1:46:32] No, you gamble with
[1:46:36] life. You don't know what exactly to
[1:46:41] do. Don't
[1:46:44] gamble. You are going to
[1:46:47] lose.
[1:46:49] Amen. Today you'll be
[1:46:52] rich and tomorrow you get
[1:46:55] poor. Amen. Amen. Because of gambling
[1:46:58] with
[1:46:59] life. Amen. Don't gamble with life.
[1:47:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Know the right
[1:47:07] investment you're
[1:47:10] making. Amen. Amen. And friends, as an
[1:47:13] agent of
[1:47:16] God. Hallelujah. Amen. You are also an
[1:47:19] agent of
[1:47:20] God.
[1:47:22] Amen. Advertise this
[1:47:28] investment. Amen.
[1:47:30] Brother, brother said
[1:47:33] once, eternal life is living for
[1:47:39] others. Jesus lived for us
[1:47:42] so that we can be
[1:47:44] saved. Make an investment that will also
[1:47:48] save your
[1:47:49] brother. Live a right
[1:47:52] life that will that when your brother
[1:47:55] sees
[1:47:56] you, it will save them. that is living
[1:48:00] for
[1:48:05] another. May God help
[1:48:10] us friends. I want to tell
[1:48:12] you as we read in the book of Luke
[1:48:15] chapter
[1:48:17] 14 that how can you build a
[1:48:20] tower without first
[1:48:23] counting the cost whether it will it
[1:48:26] will be sufficient to
[1:48:30] finish but friends I want to tell
[1:48:33] you God has already put for us a
[1:48:37] foundation on our investment
[1:48:40] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:48:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:48:46] It is in his word.
[1:48:48] In Matthew chapter
[1:48:50] 16, he saith unto them, but whom say,
[1:48:55] "Whom say ye that are
[1:48:57] young?" And Simon Peter
[1:49:01] answered, "Thou art the the
[1:49:04] Christ, the son of the living God." And
[1:49:08] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:49:11] "Blessed art thou, Simon Jonah, for
[1:49:15] flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:49:17] thee, but my father which is in heaven,
[1:49:21] and I say also unto thee, that thou art
[1:49:25] Peter, and upon this
[1:49:28] rock I will build my church, and the
[1:49:32] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:49:34] it."
[1:49:36] Hallelujah. Amen. The investment you're
[1:49:39] making has already you they have already
[1:49:41] put for you a
[1:49:45] foundation. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:51] Hallelujah. Don't try to make
[1:49:57] yours. The foundation has already been
[1:50:01] made for
[1:50:02] us. Hallelujah. We thank God for
[1:50:06] that. Friends, take that opportunity in
[1:50:09] this investment.
[1:50:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:16] We have invested in so many
[1:50:19] things. We have invested in our
[1:50:23] happiness. We have invested in our good
[1:50:26] living. But after what? What
[1:50:30] then? What then?
[1:50:35] Amen. Amen. Make a lifetime
[1:50:40] investment. Amen.
[1:50:44] This rich man that was that was with
[1:50:50] Razaras. He was also a
[1:50:52] Christian. He called father
[1:50:55] Abraham. He knew Abraham was our
[1:50:59] father. Amen. Coming to church does not
[1:51:02] mean that you've already got the
[1:51:06] investment. He was a Christian. You're
[1:51:10] also a Christian. I'm also a Christian.
[1:51:13] Amen. Amen. But we may we make a right
[1:51:18] investment.
[1:51:22] Hallelujah. Friends, I know some have
[1:51:24] have already made
[1:51:28] investment. Amen.
[1:51:30] Many some our brothers and sisters have
[1:51:33] made
[1:51:35] investment. Amen. A they made investment
[1:51:38] for their internal
[1:51:42] life.

[1:51:47] this, may you receive it this
[1:51:51] night. The investment is still open for
[1:51:56] you. Amen. You can invest your
[1:52:01] life. Amen. Sometimes you look at
[1:52:04] yourself and say, "No, I'm already gone.
[1:52:08] I'm already gone. I can't do anything. I
[1:52:12] can't invest my life." But friends, I
[1:52:14] want to encourage you. Jesus Christ is
[1:52:17] still on the throne
[1:52:20] of you can invest your life and be
[1:52:23] saved. The thief was saved on the cross.
[1:52:28] What about you as grace?
[1:52:32] Now you can also be
[1:52:35] saved. Don't give up on
[1:52:37] yourself. Make an investment of your
[1:52:41] life. Hallelujah.
[1:52:44] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Invest in
[1:52:47] this eternal
[1:52:49] life. In your
[1:52:51] life with your
[1:52:54] life. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:04] friends, you'll not regret about
[1:53:07] it. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:11] Our brothers and
[1:53:14] sisters are up
[1:53:16] there. We always sing
[1:53:19] songs. Oh, I want to see
[1:53:23] him. The day is coming.
[1:53:26] That day is
[1:53:28] coming. I believe it with all my life
[1:53:31] that day is
[1:53:33] coming. Hallelujah. May God find me with
[1:53:37] a right
[1:53:39] investment. Amen. I don't mean your
[1:53:42] money
[1:53:44] sometimes. A yes, we need money and
[1:53:47] investments in church
[1:53:51] project make your life a fast
[1:53:54] investment.
[1:53:58] Amen. You see in the
[1:54:01] Bible many will come to Jesus Christ
[1:54:04] that I preached the
[1:54:07] message that I built
[1:54:09] churches that I did this and
[1:54:13] this but he just spill them out of his
[1:54:16] mouth.
[1:54:22] So that means coming to church and doing
[1:54:24] all other
[1:54:30] things. Our life, our life, make an
[1:54:35] investment. Hallelujah. Make a right
[1:54:40] investment. That you'll never and never
[1:54:45] regret. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have
[1:54:48] seen very
[1:54:50] many that have encouraged us
[1:54:55] that we shall also make
[1:54:57] it will make it.
[1:55:00] Hallelujah.
[1:55:02] No matter what may come my
[1:55:05] way. Amen. Many laughed at
[1:55:08] Noah. They laughed at him. They said,
[1:55:12] "Look at
[1:55:14] that. They also laugh at us.
[1:55:20] But time will come
[1:55:24] when the investment you
[1:55:30] made is what is feeding you. When you
[1:55:34] make a life like if we go back to real
[1:55:37] life like our life
[1:55:39] here someone who has made an
[1:55:43] investment it is not like maybe you're
[1:55:46] going to uh eat from it like maybe
[1:55:50] tomorrow. Some people plant like maybe
[1:55:54] trees they take like 25
[1:55:57] years but after they save them when
[1:56:03] they when they're dying on
[1:56:08] beds now take it to spiritual
[1:56:13] life. Do you have any
[1:56:18] investment? Do I have any investment?
[1:56:23] Amen. Amen. May we make an investment,
[1:56:27] friends. Don't fear.
[1:56:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't fear this.
[1:56:35] We are a real
[1:56:40] business. We have always invested in
[1:56:42] other things. But

[1:57:18] Hallelujah. Amen. Let us read this
[1:57:20] quote.

[1:57:28] time where people had their life
[1:57:33] savings, get some little gadget
[1:57:37] out, get rich
[1:57:42] overnight, real
[1:57:45] quick and all after this.
[1:57:48] And they go, they have got
[1:57:51] it. The first thing they
[1:57:53] know, they find themselves
[1:57:57] on skid
[1:57:58] [Music]
[1:58:00] road in a skid road. It is like a a a
[1:58:05] city that is so
[1:58:10] dangerous. A
[1:58:13] somewhere trying to
[1:58:15] satisfy satisfy themselves.
[1:58:19] or down in their down their souls what
[1:58:22] they have done thinking about what they
[1:58:23] have
[1:58:27] done yet it is not helping
[1:58:30] them and that would be applied also in
[1:58:33] the
[1:58:35] rhythms re uh
[1:58:41] in okay that that could also be applied
[1:58:44] also in Christianity
[1:58:48] Get rich

[1:58:54] preacher. Check with the
[1:58:57] preacher. Receive it. it is

[1:59:35] come one way.

[1:59:43] overnight
[1:59:45] doesn't a good
[1:59:48] businessman won't fool with
[1:59:51] it. He bought
[1:59:54] any anything you want to invest
[1:59:58] in. Get something identifi
[2:00:02] identified
[2:00:04] business something that has been

[2:00:39] off because it has been
[2:00:42] proven. Hallelujah. Whoever is here that
[2:00:45] believeth the word of
[2:00:47] God that means it has been
[2:00:50] proved because when we read the
[2:00:53] scripture it shows us that this word has
[2:00:56] been
[2:00:58] proved and so it is a right
[2:01:01] investment.
[2:01:03] Hallelujah. Make a right
[2:01:06] investment. Hallelujah.
[2:01:09] Sometimes we invest in this get get rich

[2:01:29] investment that has been
[2:01:32] proved. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:36] It has been proved ages after ages after
[2:01:40] ages after
[2:01:43] ages. Amen. Amen. Our brothers have held

[2:01:49] Amen. Many have been
[2:01:52] saved. Hallelujah.
[2:01:57] Many have been
[2:01:59] saved making such an
[2:02:03] investment. Hallelujah.
[2:02:08] Let's read this
[2:02:10] quote. Amen. Amen.
[2:02:15] Because you say you are rich and you
[2:02:17] have need of
[2:02:20] nothing and yet knowest thou not that
[2:02:24] thou art
[2:02:26] wretched, poor,
[2:02:29] blind,
[2:02:30] miserable, naked, and do not know
[2:02:34] it. What a horrible thought that
[2:02:38] is. To think that a person would be
[2:02:40] blind.
[2:02:43] all or could be on the streets
[2:02:47] naked. That's
[2:02:49] horrible. The worst part is of
[2:02:53] it is that in that
[2:02:57] condition and yet does not know
[2:03:00] it. If that person knew that he was in
[2:03:03] that
[2:03:05] condition, he tried to help himself.
[2:03:10] being in that
[2:03:11] condition and does not know he's in that
[2:03:15] condition and he you cannot tell him any
[2:03:20] different. That's the picture that we
[2:03:22] see
[2:03:24] today. Many of us
[2:03:26] people see God moving in these last
[2:03:29] days.
[2:03:30] see the Holy Spirit coming among
[2:03:34] us with the very promises of the book of
[2:03:37] the Bible that Christ said would come
[2:03:40] would would take place and yet with our
[2:03:44] denominations denominational
[2:03:48] differences and our social
[2:03:51] standings as that young as that young
[2:03:56] man
[2:03:57] God turn down the opportunity like he
[2:04:01] us.
[2:04:04] Oh, like he
[2:04:08] did like sometimes we do it like he
[2:04:13] did. They're afra they are afraid to
[2:04:16] make an
[2:04:17] investment. He would rather hold on the
[2:04:20] things that he
[2:04:22] had,
[2:04:24] popularity,
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:27] money, instead of putting his investment
[2:04:30] when he had an opportunity at his
[2:04:34] door to the kingdom of God. I don't
[2:04:38] believe that
[2:04:39] anybody who lost Christ could said could
[2:04:43] could see could say it in a
[2:04:46] meeting takes place in a real spir
[2:04:50] spiritfilled Pentecostal output in this
[2:04:54] day. We see that very presence of Jesus
[2:04:58] Christ strike down upon the
[2:05:00] people and perform and
[2:05:03] perform and do the things that he
[2:05:05] promised.
[2:05:07] be done in this
[2:05:09] day. Amen. Amen. And turn away the
[2:05:13] opportunity that God gave you to become
[2:05:16] part of
[2:05:18] it. What a thing that young young fellow
[2:05:23] did to turn away this opportunity.
[2:05:27] And
[2:05:28] what a rashy thing the denominations are
[2:05:31] doing
[2:05:32] today. Instead of accepting and
[2:05:35] embracing the Holy
[2:05:38] Spirit and forgetting their difference,
[2:05:41] they separate brotherhood and try to
[2:05:43] draw away little groups like their own
[2:05:51] following. I mean we please don't turn
[2:05:55] away the opportunity.
[2:05:58] An opportunity may be for you
[2:06:00] today. Don't turn away the
[2:06:04] opportunity. Sometimes an opportunity
[2:06:07] comes
[2:06:09] once or it may have come very many times
[2:06:11] in your
[2:06:13] life. Amen. And you turn it away. You
[2:06:17] turn the last
[2:06:19] opportunity. Hallelujah. Please don't
[2:06:22] turn away opportunity.
[2:06:25] Amen. Amen.
[2:06:28] There's an opportunity for you to
[2:06:30] invest.
[2:06:32] Hallelujah. Your life. Hallelujah.
[2:06:43] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:06:48] Friends, I'm offering you
[2:06:51] through the the the the power and
[2:06:53] authority given to us
[2:06:58] God knew I would stand
[2:07:02] here. I'm not presenting my
[2:07:05] idea. I'm not presenting my my in or my
[2:07:10] business. This is the business of my
[2:07:13] father. It is for your father. If you
[2:07:16] believe God is your father,
[2:07:21] make an investment. Amen. Amen. It will
[2:07:25] save your life.
[2:07:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It will save
[2:07:29] your life.
[2:07:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:07:37] Don't be taken up by other
[2:07:40] things. Yes, we have to do other
[2:07:43] things. Yes, we have to invest in other
[2:07:45] things. Amen.
[2:07:48] But don't
[2:07:50] forget your life comes first.
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:07:58] The truth is
[2:08:02] you cannot even what you you you're
[2:08:05] trying to make as a something big or
[2:08:07] investing so much in in life like this
[2:08:10] real
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:15] life. Sometimes it will fail. You reach
[2:08:18] a point you fail.
[2:08:21] You have already secured this
[2:08:24] investment. Sometimes things make just
[2:08:28] happen. You don't force
[2:08:30] yourself. Amen. Things will just be
[2:08:34] moving like as if this normal
[2:08:37] life to
[2:08:39] overcome. Amen. Amen. You not
[2:08:43] struggle. Amen. Yes, things may not be

[2:20:39] manner of woman this is." That touched
[2:20:42] him, for she's a sinner. And Jesus
[2:20:45] answered and said unto him, Simon, I

[2:21:17] both. Tell me, tell me therefore, which
[2:21:21] of them loveth him most?" Simon answered
[2:21:25] and said, "I suppose that
[2:21:27] he to to whom he forgave most." And he
[2:21:31] said unto him, "Thou has
[2:21:35] rightly right rightly judged." And he
[2:21:38] turned to the woman and said unto Simon,
[2:21:41] "Seeth thou this woman, I entered
[2:21:45] in I entered into thine house, and gave
[2:21:49] me no water for my feet, but she has

[2:34:28] way it was it
[2:34:31] is. What about
[2:34:34] you? Amen.

[2:35:36] example.
[2:35:39] Amen. May we
[2:35:42] invest the young and old.

[2:35:53] Amen.
[2:35:56] We have seen very many
[2:35:59] that have invested.

[2:36:11] him. Amen. He made an
[2:36:14] investment. Hallelujah. Amen. You can
[2:36:17] also make an investment.
[2:36:20] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:36:23] Couples, you can make an
[2:36:26] investment in your
[2:36:30] life. We see in the
[2:36:33] Bible, there's a couple that was always
[2:36:37] mentioned and a
[2:36:42] They were always
[2:36:44] mentioned. They did the work of God
[2:36:47] together. Do the work of God with your
[2:36:50] husband. Do the work of God with your
[2:36:53] wife. Amen. Amen.
[2:36:56] Don't leave her there.
[2:37:02] They preach to
[2:37:04] Apollo about the simple
[2:37:08] man of God.
[2:37:10] And when he came to preach to
[2:37:12] them, they
[2:37:14] accepted. He asked them, "Have you
[2:37:17] received the Holy Spirit since you
[2:37:18] believe?"
[2:37:20] They were Christians. They loved God.
[2:37:26] Amen. They said
[2:37:29] no. But they they yielded
[2:37:31] themselves and God saved
[2:37:34] them. Amen. Amen. So don't look at your
[2:37:38] situation. You think you you're so
[2:37:44] bad. This little
[2:37:48] prostitute, she did what she could
[2:37:50] do. What can you do at your level? What
[2:37:55] can you
[2:37:58] do? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What can you
[2:38:03] do at your level? Look at yourself at
[2:38:05] your
[2:38:07] level. What can you
[2:38:11] do? What? I don't know what you've done
[2:38:15] and I don't need to
[2:38:16] know, but look at
[2:38:20] yourself. What is your
[2:38:25] level? She looked at herself. She cried.
[2:38:29] She looked for what she could do.
[2:38:34] She
[2:38:36] tried. She said, "Oh, maybe this this
[2:38:39] money that
[2:38:42] I may
[2:38:46] even chase me, but she
[2:38:50] said, let me just
[2:38:53] go." Amen. She bought the best she
[2:38:57] could. She she brother Brandham says
[2:39:02] the only good thing she
[2:39:03] had she had the long hair
[2:39:09] that's why we the Bible encourages
[2:39:13] women amen that is your
[2:39:18] glory they didn't
[2:39:21] say he he he said clearly
[2:39:27] here Uh let me look for
[2:39:37] it. He said the hair of her
[2:39:41] [Music]
[2:39:43] head. Amen. She used
[2:39:46] that is the only thing good thing she
[2:39:51] had. You may have wasted yourself.
[2:39:57] But I want to tell you that there's an
[2:40:00] an
[2:40:01] investment that can save
[2:40:08] you. That
[2:40:11] investment is just presented to
[2:40:14] you. Amen. As brother brotherham said
[2:40:18] here, he said, "Oh
[2:40:21] businessmen, this morning, I'm offering
[2:40:24] you as an agent of Jesus
[2:40:27] Christ of eternal life, a policy of

[2:41:30] sends you to places you not go
[2:41:33] to and keeps you away from places that
[2:41:37] you would not
[2:41:39] go. We want a policy.
[2:41:43] You want to make an
[2:41:50] investment
[2:41:52] friends now
[2:41:56] here. An investment is right
[2:41:59] here. If you've
[2:42:02] invested, you can invest
[2:42:04] more. Invest more of your life. Live
[2:42:07] forever.
[2:42:11] to God's
[2:42:13] word. Amen. Amen. Have no
[2:42:16] option but to serve
[2:42:19] God. Amen. Amen. With whatever you have
[2:42:24] simplicity.
[2:42:26] Amen. All of us cannot stand here and
[2:42:30] preach but your life can preach
[2:42:35] something. Amen. Amen.

[2:42:52] us. Amen.
[2:42:54] Just invest
[2:42:57] yourself and you'll see it paying
[2:43:02] you. Hallelujah.
[2:43:06] Don't mind on what people may tell
[2:43:10] you. Yeah, people will
[2:43:13] talk. They will talk this and
[2:43:16] this. They will
[2:43:19] say you come, you go. Even sometimes
[2:43:24] preachers, they will tell you the same
[2:43:27] thing. Amen. Amen. But
[2:43:31] God Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:43:34] God, he has not yet given up on
[2:43:37] you. If he has given up on
[2:43:40] you would either bury you today or maybe
[2:43:43] would have buried you
[2:43:46] today. Amen. Amen. But if you have a
[2:43:51] chance, take this
[2:43:55] investment. Amen. Invest your
[2:43:58] life. Amen. Amen. People will laugh.
[2:44:03] That's the truth.
[2:44:06] They will mock
[2:44:11] you like they think for them they have
[2:44:14] made
[2:44:15] [Music]
[2:44:17] it.
[2:44:19] Amen. But you have your own
[2:44:25] journey. I have my
[2:44:27] own. But we are all
[2:44:29] heading to see our father.
[2:44:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just carry your
[2:44:36] cross. Carry your
[2:44:38] cross. Amen.
[2:44:41] Carry your cross
[2:44:45] obediently. And just follow
[2:44:47] God. Amen. Amen. Sometimes you don't
[2:44:50] know what will happen
[2:44:52] next. We see even the servants of God
[2:44:54] like
[2:44:56] Moses. He
[2:44:57] cried. Yet God had given him
[2:45:01] authority. Sometimes the things of God
[2:45:03] are so high that you cannot even see
[2:45:04] them with your
[2:45:07] eyes. Amen.
[2:45:10] Amen. Even an opportunity may be
[2:45:13] here, but you're not seeing
[2:45:17] it. You're not seeing it.
[2:45:22] Friends, the opportunity is
[2:45:25] here. Whenever we come here, whenever
[2:45:28] you hear this, the word of God being
[2:45:31] preached, just know an opportunity is
[2:45:33] presented to you.
[2:45:36] be
[2:45:37] anywhere home
[2:45:40] sales when you find an evangelist
[2:45:44] in
[2:45:46] confessions here at
[2:45:49] church in your conversations with
[2:45:53] friends. Amen. Sometimes someone tells
[2:45:55] you the word of
[2:45:59] God. Amen. Amen. Just take it.
[2:46:03] Hallelujah. Amen. Just take it.
[2:46:07] Hallelujah. And you'll be saved.
[2:46:11] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:46:14] In this age, we are blinded by very,
[2:46:16] very many
[2:46:20] [Music]
[2:46:21] things. But we are a peculiar
[2:46:25] people. Hallelujah. Tell
[2:46:28] yourself that I'm a son or a daughter of
[2:46:31] God.
[2:46:35] and believe it and hold on
[2:46:38] it. The devil may debate with
[2:46:42] you, but tell him now, I'm a son and
[2:46:45] daughter of
[2:46:48] God.
[2:46:50] Hallelujah. Just keep keep saying it.
[2:46:54] Keep saying it. Keep confessing it.
[2:46:56] Confessing it every
[2:46:58] day. Amen. Amen. Yesterday I was going
[2:47:02] home and something was disturbing me in
[2:47:04] my
[2:47:05] head. I told the devil I was remembering
[2:47:08] the sermon the other brother preached
[2:47:10] from South
[2:47:12] Africa. I said I I I went telling the
[2:47:15] devil God knows me. He knows even what
[2:47:19] I'm going through. He even knows what
[2:47:21] I'm thinking now. He knows. He knows me.
[2:47:26] So you have nothing to tell.
[2:47:29] I kept telling it to myself and if
[2:47:32] someone saw me in the
[2:47:33] way think maybe I was mad because I was
[2:47:36] talking to myself and
[2:47:40] laughing. I thinking of God's
[2:47:42] word. God knows me. I was also getting
[2:47:46] surprised. I said God knows me. He knows
[2:47:50] everything. He know he knows even
[2:47:53] everything that is around me. He knows
[2:47:56] it.
[2:47:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I got
[2:48:01] encouraged. Amen. Amen. In this journey,
[2:48:04] when you see your brother getting
[2:48:07] discouraged, tell them God knows you.
[2:48:11] Knows your case. He knows when to take
[2:48:13] you through. He knows what to do. Amen.
[2:48:17] Amen. Just yield
[2:48:20] yourself. Hallelujah. Just be
[2:48:23] obedient. Like we have seen people
[2:48:26] setting us examples very
[2:48:30] many that even didn't know what was
[2:48:32] coming
[2:48:34] next as the Bible says like as it was in
[2:48:38] the days of
[2:48:39] Noah it will be in the last
[2:48:43] days also maybe reach the
[2:48:47] point he
[2:48:50] said Abraham reached at a
[2:48:52] point 25
[2:48:56] Yeah, but God
[2:49:00] promised. Just believed on that. Just
[2:49:03] leaned on that.
[2:49:05] Hallelujah.
[2:49:08] As I finish, I just want you to take it.
[2:49:12] I just want you to invest in this
[2:49:14] internal life.
[2:49:16] I just want you to take this
[2:49:18] policy to you
[2:49:22] yourself and you'll see God
[2:49:25] moving and you'll see getting some real
[2:49:30] thing.
[2:49:32] Aina some things you have not seen them
[2:49:35] because you have not yielded
[2:49:38] yourself. May God just help us. May God
[2:49:42] just help us even in our conditions.

[2:49:49] ourselves a

[2:49:53] us. He's more than able to to fulfill
[2:49:56] his
[2:49:57] word. He's obligated to perform his
[2:50:02] word. Amen. Amen. He is
[2:50:05] obligated like you're a slave to
[2:50:08] God. Like like you a slave to
[2:50:13] God, he's also a slave to his
[2:50:18] word. Amen. If he promised he meant
[2:50:24] it. Amen. Amen. Don't take it for
[2:50:29] granted. I've seen it. I've seen this
[2:50:32] word changing my life.
[2:50:35] It has really changed my
[2:50:37] life. I mean like this lady, the word
[2:50:40] changed her
[2:50:42] life. Amen.
[2:50:44] It changed her life. I saw it changing
[2:50:47] my
[2:50:48] life. Sometimes I I I gave up on
[2:50:53] myself. But I I said, "But God knows
[2:50:57] me. He knows you.
[2:51:00] He knows you.
[2:51:02] [Music]

[2:51:12] you. He knows
[2:51:14] everything. He knows whatever you're
[2:51:16] going through. Carry your
[2:51:19] cross and just follow
[2:51:22] him. Truly friends, I've seen this word
[2:51:25] changing my
[2:51:27] life. I believed
[2:51:29] it. Even when I failed many
[2:51:33] times, I failed many
[2:51:36] times. I said, "But God, you own my
[2:51:41] life." And that's how we saved me. And
[2:51:44] he's still doing good works in my
[2:51:46] life. And he can do the same for you. If
[2:51:50] he did it for me, if you're yearning for
[2:51:53] eternal
[2:51:54] life, if he gave it to our brothers and
[2:51:56] sisters,
[2:51:59] He can also give it to
[2:52:02] you. He can give it to you. Just invest
[2:52:08] yourself. Amina,

[2:55:58] when I
[2:56:03] call. Amen. And may the Lord help
[2:56:06] us that we might be able to invest our
[2:56:11] lives. You know friends, um, it's been
[2:56:15] about 19 years
[2:56:17] ago when I first heard this
[2:56:21] message and I knew it was the voice of
[2:56:24] God for my
[2:56:26] life and I decided to uh invest my
[2:56:30] life. I still remember when I I was at
[2:56:33] that river uh lake
[2:56:37] bank after I was
[2:56:39] baptized. I said these
[2:56:41] words as a prayer in my heart to
[2:56:45] God. I said God because you have
[2:56:47] revealed this truth to
[2:56:50] me and you have made yourself known to
[2:56:53] me. I am going to uh take this
[2:56:57] message wherever I will go and I'll
[2:57:00] preach this message many all to the
[2:57:04] few and I will I give my
[2:57:07] life for the purpose of spreading this
[2:57:12] word. I still believe that each of us
[2:57:15] can make such a
[2:57:17] place and you make yourself as an
[2:57:22] investment into the kingdom of
[2:57:25] God. This kind of investment is
[2:57:27] [Music]
[2:57:29] assured. If you live for the sake of the
[2:57:33] gospel, you are not going to have a
[2:57:36] loss. Amen. It's going to be it's going
[2:57:39] to pay off.
[2:57:41] Tell your neighbor, it's going to pay
[2:57:44] off. It's going to pay
[2:57:47] off. May God help us that we may be able
[2:57:51] to do the work of
[2:57:53] God. You know, whatever we do even here,
[2:57:56] what are we
[2:57:59] doing? We are
[2:58:02] investing. Did you know the rapture is
[2:58:04] actually going on now?
[2:58:11] now and there are people who are in
[2:58:14] churches waiting for the
[2:58:17] rapture but the rapture is going on
[2:58:20] now. When that moment
[2:58:23] arrives
[2:58:25] whatever will happen
[2:58:28] then will be the culmination the
[2:58:32] climax of what has already been going
[2:58:35] on.
[2:58:37] You don't just get uh you know to reap
[2:58:41] out of where you have not
[2:58:44] sold. You have to s first you invest
[2:58:48] your money and then it is built over a
[2:58:51] while and then after one year or two
[2:58:55] years or three years then you reap
[2:58:58] according to your according to to your
[2:59:01] seed according to your investment. If
[2:59:04] you invested much, you harvest much. But
[2:59:08] in this case, we are going to harvest
[2:59:10] the
[2:59:11] rapture. We going to have the eternal
[2:59:15] life. We are now sewing. That's why we
[2:59:18] sing that song in the
[2:59:21] morning. So you see, we are
[2:59:23] investing overnight time of prayer,
[2:59:26] Wednesday evening service, Sunday
[2:59:28] morning, every day out there. The things
[2:59:31] we say we will not go there, we will not
[2:59:32] do that, we not Why? Because we
[2:59:35] investing our life into the kingdom of
[2:59:38] God. It is not for nothing. It's not for
[2:59:41] nothing. Tell your neighbor, it's not
[2:59:43] for nothing.
[2:59:45] We are going to harvest my
[2:59:47] God. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:59:51] Praise the Lord. Let's give the Lord a
[2:59:53] clap of
[2:59:56] praise. And may God give us a burden for
