blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen yeah just pray for me that the Lord will speak to you amen amen sometime we try to prepare what to preach and it's one of the hardest time I think but many times when the Holy Spirit comes down it takes us to another Direction I trust even tonight the Lord will speak to us as long as you came expecting to hear amen shall we turn to our Bibles and we read uh chapter 2 shall read from verse 1 to 3 therefore we ought to give the more honest he to the things which we have heard lest any time we should let them sleep for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that had him amen let's read Deuteronomy chapter 4 shall begin from vers three up to S your eyes have seen what Lord did because of uh Bal PR for all the men that followed Bal Pera the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you but ye that did cave unto the Lord your God are alive everyone of you this day behold I have taught you statutes and judgment even as the Lord my God commanded me that you should do so in the land where you go to possess it keep therefore uh keep therefore undo them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nation we shall hear all all the statues and seually this great nation is wise and understanding people for what nation is there so great who hath God so n unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call on him for amen [Music] for for [Music] [Music] amen amen Lord Jesus we thank you for the word we have read we need you to come and inspire Lord speak to our heart Lord that by the end of the service you shall speak like M of old when she asked how will this be the angel told her that she will be overshadowed and then she said be unto me according to your word precious Jesus that's all we need tonight that your word will have preeminence in our life in Christ Jesus amen amen praise be to God have your seats I want us to go back where we first read we are seeing here in Hebrews chapter 2 Apostle Paul is telling us something here and it is a warning as well we know the time we are living in there are many things happening around we are living in Lan Church age we are in the ends of the end time we are living in the time where the Bible warns us in Revelation where the church will be look home not hot not cold and God say that he will spute this church out of his mouth blessed be the name of the Lord we are living in the time where there are a lot of forces fighting against the [Music] church and where the church when we're talking about the church we are not talking about this building but we are talking about the bride of Christ blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus told us that Upon This Rock he will build a church amen amen and I say where that church is we are meaning the bride blessed be the name Lord amen and here he says that therefore we ought to give more honest more honest he to things which we have heard amen what are those things which we have heard Apostle Paul is telling us to give more Hest the things that we have heard amen when we come to church we don't just come to sit go back and we forget what we have heard blessed be the name of the Lord I remember one time we talked about uh being on guard amen and today I will say do not look back let us not look back Amen Let us watch and not look back let us be vigilant and not look back [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord amen let us keep the pace let us keep moving forward blessed be the name of the Lord otherwise by the time you realize found yourself when you're already backl you know many time when we talk about backsliding we think it's committing fornication and when someone say so so back you think maybe fornicated that's not it it's part of it okay but backsliding let me tell you many Believers many Christians lead amen others have just become church goers they only read the Bible when they at church amen they'll only remember prayer when the service day that is backsliding the Bible tells us to pray without ceasing pray always blessed be the name of the Lord amen he said L at any time we should let them sleep for if the word spoken by Angels was steast and every transgression and every Disobedience received a just recompense of reward every Disobedience every transgression received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape how shall you escape praise the Lord you know there is something uh there is something coming out of the world coming out of Egypt blessed be the name of the Lord many came out of Egypt but they came with Egypt inside them amen amen many came out of the world and we came to Christ and some came with Egypt in [Music] them but the calling of God was to get out of Egypt and go into the promised land to separate from Egypt blessed be the name of the Lord amen and many time we don't want to depart from egyp we want to work with Egypt in us and that is what is holding us that's why we are not running at the P blessed be the name of the Lord but God want us to run at his SP he to grow he want the church to be a prayerful church he want Believers to pray and fast he want us to live Christian Life blessed be the name of the Lord amen so he say how shall we escape if we neglect the great salvation which at first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that had him blessed be the name of the Lord amen butam says in the message uh Fellowship there something that I want us to see it says that one that one time an old colored fellow after I was preaching on the street corner said preacher you know what your conscious is you know what your conscious is I said I have a idea sir what do you think it is said it is a little thing said like this and this and got four sharp Point said when you do anything wrong C and say you keep letting it [Music] cut it cut a circle around there and after a while you don't even feel it at all and that is right you just keep looking drifting away drifting away and after a while you are all the way gone past blessed be the name of are you seeing the example we being given here the Church of Christ or a gen Christian we all to be on fire for God you must hunger and thirst for God you must be on your knees blessed be the name of the but have you ever been in a station where it's like even when you do something wrong like is not a big deal that's one of the worst Str a [Music] Christian where you no longer have conviction amen you are going the wrong path but your conscience is just okay you don't feel [Music] anything amen amen on Sunday you come late and it is okay you just sleep without prayer and it's okay when they serve you food you will never forget to wash your hands but you forget to pray for [Music] that it's just okay blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I want us to pinch our conscious this evening that there is somewhere where Christ want us to be and we have a strong warning in the word the Bible tells us where we read in Deuteronomy that there is no any other Nation on Earth who has G like the one we are having so we are peculiar people we are different people amen we are redeemed of the lord we are purchased by his own blood and this SCH where we have I wonder if we are not a victim amen the prophet say he was preaching at the corner and a certain asked him preacher you know what your conscious is I said I have idea sir what do you think of it say it's a little thing said like this and got for Shar points amen and say that when you do anything [Music] wrong it cuts the name of the Lord You Keep letting it cut uhhuh and it cuts a circle around there yes and after a while you don't even feel it at all you see and that is a conscious our conscious ow to be active [Music] 247 Apostle Paul tells us examine yourself amen what makes it to examine yourself it's your conscience whether you are still in the faith amen so that conscious has to be there [Music] how are you standing tonight is everything okay with you are you still standing or you have looked back amen we all to be moving forward because we receive the matching order amen the song say that he sounded for the trumpet they sounded for the trumpet and will not sound for a retweet why do you retweet praise be to God for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast amen and every transgression and Disobedience received just Rec whatever we do there is a reward to it whatever we do in words in Deeds amen it has a [Music] reward we sh action we are taking there is award for church we action has a reward for [Music] Rich praise be to God it's time we pinch our conscience if you live an un prayerful life it has a reward for blessed be the name of the Lord do not look back God want us to move forward he never sent the prophet for us to look back he sent us the prophet Amen to open our says every time you see a major prophet in the land it is a sign of judgment because the Bible tells us that surely surely the Lord God will do nothing Reve his sacred to his servants the prophet amen before this world is Mitt with C God had to send a prophet to warn this generation above the RO coming praise be to God and many time we think it is for the world God does not care about those who does not belong to him one time a pastor told us that God has not CH in the neighbor's [Music] children amen am blessed be the name of the Lord amen so every single day we ought to be more serious amen because there is no time look at the media chaos is everywhere in the world in Kenya there is Mand Mand in Uganda there is Mand Uganda Mand in Israel there is war in ukra there is war war the other side Landslide the other side floods Kings there is proplex everywhere and we know Jesus told us this will be the beginning of [Applause] sorrow and this world will never have peace amen until the Prince of Peace will come blessed be the name of the Lord things are not going to be better but things are going to get worse and worse praise be to God but thanks be to God that we have an anchor you must be anchored in Christ I must be anchored in Christ if I am to stand amen we cannot joke around and think that we're going to make it we must do something otherwise we are going we will be easily be taken by [Music] this praise be to God [Music] amen praise the lord we should not suppress our conscience always when you do something wrong put it right when we break the word let us go back to God we are sorry we not mean to do it have mer on us when God is quiet he doesn't mean that you okay praise be to God one time when Israel were fighting the war and God was quiet they lost the battle men were killed amen and the captain called for a retweet because he said that something had gone wrong the promise was that they had they were to overcome each and every battle they fighting blessed be the name of the Lord but we're living in the time when God quiet Believers think they presume that it's okay no sir the joy of the Lord is our strength when God is happy we are winning blessed be the name of the Lord we are living in the time where the Bible says the voice of God is rare and where is the voice of God the voice of God is in the word of God Believers are no longer hearing the voice of God praise be to God Amen you just keep [Music] look I always wonder Breen who does not amend the word in church I'm not God is speaking about eternal life about rupture about the Holy Ghost about Glory L where the lamb is the life and just with the dry lips praise be to God there is something wrong Believe Me Brother there is something wrong somewhere amen amen let us speak about these things let us hammer it you see for me even in church I want to sit where people don't

Wasing with food praise be to God Amen the word of God the Bible says like a hammer that Hammers and breaks everything into pieces praise be to God hallelujah hallelu drifting away and after a while

the other one I have to Bath this I have to feed this one dress this one and do you expect me to come you have some some have some humanistic pity on me P me and you even Waging War praise be to God

tells us that even the angels which never kept their places they were not spared and they ask us how shall we escape how shall we escape so we ought to be more careful brother the blood of Jesus is there it is true but that blood to make us more serious because somebody offered his son to buy a Salvation so we all to be more careful and more serious for God so love the world that he gave his only only brother shame sacrific only his son only for you the sacrifice was paid no we ought to be more careful and more serious blessed with the name of the Lord when we listen to the message when we read the Bible when we read the message we are seeing what God did in our generation but if you look at ourselves where are we if you look at yourself where have you reached as far as the message is concerned and if you have not what are you doing toward that was in his first coming shall it be second this word put on flesh coming this same word is putting on flesh in Second Coming blessed be the name of the Lord so we are not supposed to take things for granted the B says we should seek him while we should call on him while he still near are you calling on him are you seeking after him oh you are among those who says the prophet prayed for me he f for me blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible told us in Deuteronomy chapter 4 eyes what the Lord did because of B prayer for all men that followed idol worship and the Lord th God destroyed them among you but you did leave unto the Lord your God and Alive everyone of you this day the only way to the only way to be alive is to cling to the word is to follow the word to walk according to the word praise be to God God is a fair judge amen amen what did for others who did it wrong he will do for you if you go wrong what did to those who pleased him he will do the same to you the same seriousness he he required from [Music] them it's the same seriousness he is requiring from you and me we ought to be more serious than the first Believers than even the pet of old praise be to God but we living in the time where even some denomination churches they are more serious than Bel what went wrong are we okay brother not works justify many people it is true it's not works but also it's not laziness things will not work out that way you must do something we must do something where are you standing tonight are you winning or you are losing are you still in the faith or you back sleep are you moving forward or you relax are you H or cold when I was still in the SEMA Hall I've I never saw anybody doing in the ca hall because when

Spectators become even the coach only one number when he's washing to give number and you find the vi men jumping on women put putting on their on their J but we are living in the time where Christians they don't even want to be identified with the Bible they are moving with smartphones you say shall We Stand and read the word and then you find them reading praise to God every Army has a uniform uniforms they have some tokens identify them from other people every Club football club R Club basketball they have their uniform to identify themselves Christian Christian Army we have our uniform when you see a brother or a sister fearing to identify himself herself with the Bible you just know his back leading is living in sin yes sir I remember when we approaching you meeting God touched one sister and she and she bought for every youth a Bible praise be to God but if I may ask here and I'm going to ask you I want to see your praise be to God what went wrong those things look small but they are serious the very things we are overlooking and we are undering they are very serious in the sight of God you will never find a soldier without a gun no sir in fact I realize sometime even when they put they like they call them L all C realize they have vest ins praise be to God what happened when you just believed you used to move with your Bible but nowadays the Bible is boring you're moving with a magazine I remember some time back I used to find you could find this young people everybody with player you go where they working from you find like three of them playing in the same room oh my brother brother is not here brother Dan how is it there now you find Brethren were hot Z us this one's playing by faing moving my Mountain what went wrong you back repent and go back and do the first work that's what God is demanding from you yes sir let us go back to our Bibles let us go back to the message let us go back and listen to the prophet read your message books read the Bible if you don't they will judge you on the day of judgment blessed be the name of the Lord this is our Ark of the Covenant you ought to walk with it wherever you go in your bag make sure that you have one amen how can a Believer move without a message even when you're in the taxi pull out your your pistol start reading pull out your Bible amen amen when they're speaking their new sense put on your head listen to the message praise be to God that is what God is demanding from us that's why God has Creed Us in this generation amen amen praise be to God come to church with your Bible and don't leave them here one day you will be going home you left the Bible here in overnight they will catch and say where are you coming from I'm from the church you show them the phone they will take the phone also they will take you the phone this is what identifies us praise be to God there is no man who walks with a Bible and misbehaves even when it's unserious there is power in the word praise be to God you agree with me you will never find someone walking with the Bible then goes and buy sugar can then start moving sh popor speaking v words sir so don't leave your Bible behind one day you will move with your Bible and someone will come and tell you oh preacher I have a sick person please help me come and pray for him and that's what we want there gu into the world preach the gospel believes and baptized will be saved and this sign shall follow them that in my name shall cast out you shall lay your but now just walk holding phone now if you don't how will they know you are blessed be the name of the Lord one day you will byass someone who is even dying and does not know that you're even a believer but when you identify yourself with the word it has more benefits blessed be the name of the Lord I remember one time I went to rep place my line in the Mt and I had a message uh the message the Hebrews so when I was was there the lady called me and then she told me okay she's working inside then she asked me are you a Christian I told her yes M and then she told me I have problem I want you to pray for me Brethren the place was pared and then I ask you want to pray for you said of course then she asked me why do you I didn't know that I think each time I could go there she used to see me with at least a book then she asked me why do you always move with that book I told her it's because every time the of Israel used to go they move with the AR of the my AR of the I laid my hands and prayed for her there without fear and then after we all said amen and then I was even given free service praise be to God so it's very important for us to identify ourself with the what we believe amen praise the Lord I'm about to finish uh in verses 9 of Deuteronomy chapter 4 he said that take heed to thyself and keep thy Soul diligent lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen unless they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life I'm telling you also take heed let us take heed let us not forget What the Lord Has Done what God is doing in our Liv what is doing in our mry every time we see the presence of God coming down we all to be more closer to him to expect more of him Amen Let us be in the spirit of the word you cannot spend the whole week playing video games and you think that you will come and play piano in the right you can spend the whole week watching football the whole night watching and you think you're going to come and be in the spirit you even come late the whole night we watching that's why you will end up dosing the whole service let us do the right thing in the right time let us mean business with God Brethren Christian Journey everybody fight for himself we not here as a group we here as an individual God never call you as a group he met you alone God never met me with my wife met me alone he met my wife alone alone he met brother alone praise be to God God deals with you as an

from also jump out of the and that's what Christian do Brethren our destination is SE and Heaven is our destination RT is our goal that is our ambition that's is where we put our strength that's where

us be aware be careful L you forget the Lord brought you out of the world you never came out of the World by yourself but there is a power supernal power of God which brought you out of your denomination out of prostitution out of sorer out of out ofth and that is power of God it is God who brought you out of the the Bible warns you be careful L you forget that praise be to God Jeremiah 6 ver 15 he says my people have forgotten their resting [Music] place or they Refuge God is our resting place is our refuge you want rest you go to God Ezekiel 23:35 therefore says the Lord God thou has forgotten me and cast me behind back Israel had forgotten their and Jeremiah says Jeremiah 18:15 because because my people have forgotten me I will show them my back and not my face I told you there is repercussion of going back God will show you his back you will pray you will cry he will sigh he will not hear you so let us wash and be careful you'll be in the service and you'll be like a concrete even when the holy spirit moves and touch your neb like what's happening who is cing commotion why because God turn his back to Because of Your Action because of your behavior sometime you wonder praying and they like let us watch and be careful bam used to tell them beend with our heads B the was listening and was saying let's put our heart toward the ground where we came from KN that one day we shall go back praise be to God we have to be careful when the presence of God comes down we ought to be so careful and be praying God do not byass me I know your presence is here create an atmosphere attract go to pass your way that's what B did yes sir he was expecting he was waiting and when he had noise he said I have him Jesus of nazare on me of naare do you think that Jesus had his cry like physical cry the Bible says he shouted but where Jesus is this man was even blind I believe they maybe the voices overshadowed but his faith touched on Jesus because Jesus is Touched By Faith yes sir and that is what I believe that when the presence of God is down when God is moving when God is speaking maybe the holy spoken Tong he hased and somebody's there waiting say oh God I know you are still here you cannot bypass me you know my condition brother trust me God cannot by many time we rush but if he can wait a little longer say Lord Break Me Lord bend me since you have come let me tell you when God comes down that is an opportunity for a Believer it is [Applause] opportunity amen amen it is just like in the pool of Beth when the angel came and stared the dro there fast God is healing but this time round when the presence of God comes just know the angel of the Lord is here the angel of the Covenant has come he has come to confirm his word that word has been preached it is true that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so in such a moment we to be reverence you want to be praying in your heart even little children when you hear such a commotion when the Holy Spirit is moving be careful don't move around don't start laughing teing your friends in doing that the angel of the Lord will end up striking you dead blessed be the name of I read in the message was praying forward EP and a certain Minister he said let us close our eyes and be reverent and this man he thought was more spiritual than he refused they prayed for The Boy The Boy got healed the demon went and entered that minister so it's like when they're casting the demon out of some you're supposed to close your eyes and be in prayer not gazing around he will jump out of that and get inside and you live here when you are worse so we have to be careful many time we do those things because we are called we are not sensitive enough to know that the Holy Ghost has come down and Believers ought to be serious and careful blessed be the name of the Lord how did people get healed even when they are not prayed for from the congregation it is because someone in the congregation is pulling the gift of God by believing it by being so reverent and so sensitive that since the Lord has come down and speaking that person in the prayer line that same God touch me and that's why God brought us these things remember the Bible tells us this was for our examples butam say the message have not I sent thee when you feel that when you feel that little buzzer down in your heart warning [Music] you then you better stop right there and take [Music] inventory don't keep on moving praise be to God like I've been preaching along through the night of the people breathing away from God when you hear the word come come right back it is truly the word of God there is still BS ringing you better listen to it don't walk across that because you will never get any further till you come right there where you left him you see praise be to God are you seeing what the prophet say when you hear that in your heart stop there and do the inventory your life and he has told us no you will never reach there until you come back where you left him let me ask where did you leave him in your life no longer pray sometimes Believers come to church you find making another service outside as believer believe we we should be better you come early to church and you sit in the chair and you look around do inventory in your life because every time when we come here say God you know I'm dirty please do something by the time the word comes let me be candidate that is the spirit we ought to walk into shall we stand on our feet amen I'm ending with this quote where the Prophet saying lifting off the pressure that take me back to the Rock Lord take me back to the Rock Lord take me back I'm drifting oh don't let me drift away from it the church ought to go back to that Rock Church of God let us go back to that Ro let us not drift away from that rock on Christ the sold rock rock ofes let me hide myself he's the rock in the way land is a shelter in time of the storm is a
