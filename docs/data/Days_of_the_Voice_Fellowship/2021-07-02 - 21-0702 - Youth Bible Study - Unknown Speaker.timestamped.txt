[10:59] you today
[11:00] as we uh do this fellowship
[11:04] as we have our fellowship this evening i
[11:07] i believe that whatever it is that is in
[11:09] your heart will be granted
[11:11] now i'm sorry we were left because
[11:14] we have to have an echo i don't know
[11:16] where it is
[11:25] oh what was it there yeah
[11:30] okay
[11:36] now um
[11:42] i would like to apologize for being late
[11:45] uh we never thought that we'd be late
[11:47] because
[11:48] we left quite early but as you know we
[11:52] went into the hospital
[11:54] we were delayed uh
[11:58] you know last night my wife there is
[12:00] left
[12:01] because you know the child was having a
[12:03] high fever she was running a high fever
[12:06] so all through the night so i decided to
[12:09] go into speed and do some checkups cause
[12:11] we prayed we lived for his healing
[12:14] so we said let's go to the hospital and
[12:16] find out
[12:17] if that demon is still there so when we
[12:20] reach there
[12:21] the doctor told us the demon is not
[12:27] all diseases are demons all sickness is
[12:30] demons
[12:31] so the doctor checked and they say that
[12:34] the child is
[12:37] and whichever say that you should just
[12:38] keep giving the child bananas
[12:43] to try to put down the fevers if they
[12:45] come
[12:46] so we believe that the others heal the
[12:48] child and uh
[12:55] amen so uh without wasting more time i
[12:58] know
[12:58] time has been one hour has been taken so
[13:01] we'd like to take
[13:02] time right away and i saw sister peace
[13:04] she came
[13:16] so i'd like to first of all give your
[13:19] testimony these books
[13:20] i'm not even open them yet uh
[13:24] these books i've just come from south
[13:27] africa
[13:28] uh you know i i have a set of these
[13:31] books but i
[13:31] i gave one of the books to
[13:35] uh to one person i gave them this
[13:38] this one and they never returned it so
[13:41] it's book one book two and book three of
[13:43] the supernatural books
[13:45] uh so i i wrote a
[13:48] brother a pastor a friend in south
[13:50] africa
[13:52] and uh the writer will save this one i
[13:54] think this is the third business i wrote
[13:56] him
[13:57] i told him i would like to buy if i have
[13:59] to play but
[14:00] he instead just sent me so i don't know
[14:04] i don't know who would be blessed
[14:06] to read first hallelujah
[14:10] hey i know that many people have read
[14:12] one and they are waiting for book two
[14:14] so well be blessed whether you praise me
[14:16] i will give the
[14:17] read book too fast it is right here
[14:19] waiting i don't know who is going to be
[14:20] fast
[14:21] it is right here then i also have uh
[14:26] several booklets here i don't know who
[14:28] wants to read them first these are all
[14:30] messages
[14:31] this one is called uh
[14:34] this one is called goddess wrapped gift
[14:38] this is called wash wash the top of
[14:42] cotton i think
[14:48] he's taking this uh from the saturn
[14:51] church edge
[14:52] so it's an except for the charge this
[14:54] one
[14:56] then also there's another one uh
[15:00] why it had to be shepherds there's
[15:03] another one
[15:04] if it's very clear by prophets there's
[15:07] another one
[15:08] they're falling apart of the world so i
[15:11] don't know who is going to be fast
[15:13] reading these books
[15:15] amen okay i don't want to keep these
[15:19] books
[15:19] these are the this white happy bishop
[15:21] was reading fast
[15:24] okay one person here doesn't have
[15:25] appetite if you don't have appetite it's
[15:28] up to you
[15:30] [Music]
[15:32] you have to behave as if you have other
[15:33] life right away
[15:35] even clear by prophecy
[15:52] okay
[16:06] that book i need it because we are we
[16:09] are reading the church edge book i'll
[16:10] give you some time
[16:11] i need it in four weeks in four weeks
[16:15] bring it back
[16:16] and don't bring it back until you're
[16:18] finished reading it
[16:19] and you must give it to me by
[16:21] information
[16:24] i hope i made myself clear so if you you
[16:27] thought you were having an appetite for
[16:30] taking a book to make it happen
[16:33] way unto you so i believe you take it
[16:36] serious and read it
[16:37] you have enough time for which is really
[16:39] a long time because
[16:41] really these summon books are uh are
[16:44] preaching
[16:45] you know it's like a preaching of one
[16:47] service
[16:48] it sits down connect can you put that
[16:51] just to minimize it he just
[16:52] uh uh sits down and he preaches
[16:56] he preaches the service it reaches
[17:01] someone for maybe one hour two hours
[17:03] actually if you read it you can read it
[17:05] maximum
[17:06] four hours you'll be done with it don't
[17:08] read it as if you are
[17:09] uh yamaha you know as if you're eating
[17:13] reference and again you eat them
[17:15] even when you're listening never listen
[17:17] to the message like that
[17:19] you should listen to finish it because
[17:21] it's the preaching which people are
[17:22] sitting there
[17:23] so me when i'm saying i behave as if i'm
[17:26] sitting there with those brands
[17:28] i'm saying i mean with them until the
[17:30] summer is finished then i i say oh today
[17:33] i was blessed you see
[17:34] i don't just say ah let me listen to two
[17:37] minutes
[17:37] okay i'll now cause i'm listening no
[17:40] don't do that
[17:41] are you reading now are you listening to
[17:42] your message don't listen to the message
[17:44] like that
[17:45] you enter into the inspiration then you
[17:47] will get the appetite
[17:49] praise the name of the lord now
[17:52] we are happy the church ended with us
[17:54] and uh and as usual i'm going to begin
[17:57] with a a few people
[18:00] uh first of all i would say if those uh
[18:03] some are picked up
[18:04] and they have something they read that
[18:05] they want to share with us i will give
[18:07] each of you two to five minutes whoever
[18:10] wants to share first
[18:11] whatever it is that they have read on
[18:13] the on the chat book
[18:15] yes move first
[18:18] oh no i thought you were going to come
[18:20] running
[18:24] [Music]
[18:25] who first
[18:28] [Music]
[18:30] no one first should i choose myself
[18:34] yes
[18:34] [Music]
[18:37] oh our sister fast all right this is
[18:39] unfortunate
[18:41] us what what was it that was so
[18:45] you know uh that was so touching to you
[18:48] and
[18:49] and something that you really read i
[18:50] know i have a few questions that came
[18:52] from you some of you
[18:53] i'm going to deal with those but i will
[18:56] uh
[18:56] i will handle them after i usually want
[18:59] to hear from you first
[19:10] especially
[19:14] john jesus wrote through john and the
[19:17] revelation
[19:19] the singles prophecies happened jesus
[19:21] wrote this book himself
[19:24] like a prophecy just like
[19:27] for the next years what is going to
[19:30] happen
[19:31] we are seeing exactly what is happening
[19:34] and the end is near
[19:40] and one thing is that god respects his
[19:44] word
[19:45] and he fulfills his word so if you say
[19:48] this it sure has to come yes
[19:52] he doesn't promise and does it
[19:57] so whatever he said if it is not yet
[19:59] first
[20:00] it's going to pass
[20:06] [Music]
[20:10] [Applause]
[20:17] and it talks about uh she talked about
[20:20] something the book it's the book of
[20:22] prophecy
[20:23] can we have some other volunteer i would
[20:25] like you to follow that if you don't
[20:26] know
[20:27] i'll pick you anyway so it would be
[20:29] better for you
[20:31] before i pick you and then you
[20:46] yes
[20:54] [Music]
[20:59] [Music]
[21:00] so i also blessed that and it became so
[21:03] exciting
[21:10] [Music]
[21:12] i've been thinking but yesterday like
[21:14] sunday
[21:19] but when i read it well i took my time
[21:24] i was alone i took my time to read it
[21:27] i read the bible
[21:42] this
[21:51] [Music]
[21:53] so it's really not that day
[21:58] but it's only that when you give him you
[22:00] give yourself to him
[22:02] then you rest from like controlling
[22:04] yourself
[22:06] you rest from making opinions for
[22:08] yourself
[22:09] you know the rest are then given
[22:12] you sit and then someone takes over yes
[22:15] so actually that was the meaning of the
[22:17] servant and i was so blessed
[22:20] by that friends of course
[22:24] what's
[22:36] [Applause]
[22:38] amen
[22:46] so you see uh when someone shares
[22:50] something that they read
[22:52] even when you might have read the place
[22:53] you might not even understand
[22:55] when someone comes up says something
[22:57] about the same thing that you have read
[22:59] and then it kind of enlightens you so
[23:01] that's quite good
[23:02] uh god bless you brother okay now uh
[23:06] let us have someone else yes
[23:18] from the first chapter what's
[23:22] what was the light i was explaining
[23:24] about
[23:26] jesus jesus was just an empty name
[23:30] given by people so we passed our own
[23:33] time when speaking about
[23:36] how god and jesus are one
[23:39] i understood that jesus is just an ugly
[23:42] name
[23:42] what that's actually a
[23:48] question
[24:03] okay god bless you now which what area
[24:06] are you differently can you refresh that
[24:07] portion that which made you
[24:09] realize that
[24:12] you don't have your jacket it's a
[24:16] big
[24:28] okay you have it so you want to read it
[24:30] for us
[24:55] okay are you there you want to read for
[24:57] us brother
[25:07] what does it say
[25:27] okay right for unto you he's born to
[25:30] stay in the city
[25:32] for unto you he's born we stay in the
[25:34] city of david and savior
[25:36] which is christ alone he was born the
[25:39] christ
[25:40] and eight days later he was circumcised
[25:42] and he was named jesus
[25:44] even as the dictator told him i was born
[25:48] abraham
[25:49] when i was born he gave me the name
[25:52] william
[25:53] he was christ that was given a name down
[25:56] here among men
[25:58] the outline men could see us both jesus
[26:03] he was the lord so glory
[26:06] the almighty manifested in flesh is god
[26:10] the father son and holy ghost
[26:13] is over
[26:17] go ahead father son and holy
[26:21] holy ghost other status they are not
[26:24] names
[26:25] that is why we baptized in the name of
[26:27] the lord
[26:28] jesus christ for that is a name not
[26:31] attached
[26:33] it is the name of those titles
[26:38] just like you take a number who is a son
[26:41] and name him baby is what it is
[26:46] son is the title then you name him
[27:04] but
[27:09] amen but there is only one of them born
[27:13] the christ and he says lord who is that
[27:22] there's only one born the christ
[27:25] and that is our lord jesus christ
[27:38] okay now uh the this portion that you
[27:41] read was really
[27:43] uh you want you you want to add on what
[27:45] you just read you want to say
[27:46] something which patterns yes
[27:50] i made a mistake very nice okay that's
[27:54] good
[27:55] i'm glad you said it go ahead
[27:58] uh that's what
[28:13] in the name of the lord jesus christ for
[28:16] that is a name
[28:22] it is the name of those titles just like
[28:25] take anyone baby and then
[28:35] [Music]
[28:44] jesus was not a title of god jesus was a
[28:48] name
[28:49] he was born the christ okay just like
[28:52] you you are born
[28:53] and abu you are you are born
[28:56] me i'm born you know my father's name
[28:59] you you're born academic you're you're
[29:00] born you understand
[29:02] so you are bor you're born in your
[29:03] family
[29:05] where was jesus before he was born he
[29:07] was in god
[29:09] you know in the beginning was there one
[29:12] and the one was
[29:14] with god and the one was god and the one
[29:16] put on
[29:17] flesh so before he put on flesh he was
[29:19] with god he was ill god he was
[29:21] with god with what means he was together
[29:24] with god
[29:25] you see the spirit and christ means
[29:27] spirit the anointed one
[29:29] so jesus christ was born the christ he
[29:32] was not born
[29:33] a man he was born the christ he was god
[29:36] who has put on
[29:37] flesh but the name that he was given
[29:40] hallelujah that name was given to uh a
[29:43] son who was born
[29:45] that name was given to a child who was
[29:46] born and that flesh
[29:48] and blood all right and that name was
[29:51] jesus but jesus
[29:52] has a big symbolism jesus means
[29:56] uh jesus means jehovah our salvation
[30:01] jehovah has saved us amen amen
[30:04] and so he was born ah
[30:09] the christ was born the christ that's
[30:11] who he was
[30:12] okay he was god but he was but as a
[30:16] as a human being he was then given a
[30:18] name as a human
[30:20] being that's why that name was not given
[30:21] to anybody before jesus was born
[30:24] you see but the team did preach a very
[30:27] good summon on this and he titled it
[30:29] jesus the name about all names i'm going
[30:31] to put that
[30:32] a booklet for you
[30:36] and i will give you to read me i'll do
[30:38] my part it is
[30:39] upon you also to do your part to make
[30:40] sure you read this thing that
[30:42] we give to you so but he really
[30:44] explained it very well in rwanda and in
[30:46] english we are going to have
[30:47] those booklets and i will give it out to
[30:50] you jesus
[30:51] the name of our audience god had been
[30:53] called millionaires
[30:54] okay of course jehovah said is his name
[30:56] but jehovah was in many forms
[30:58] all right he went on revealing
[31:02] his his his characteristics he wasn't
[31:05] revealing his attributes
[31:06] and he had never revealed himself as a
[31:09] savior as a redeemer as a savior
[31:11] he wasn't to die for human beings only
[31:14] in jesus
[31:15] did he reveal that that's why it says
[31:17] there is no name
[31:18] whereby we can be saved it's only
[31:21] through the name of
[31:22] jesus because the name of jesus
[31:25] is the name about all names even the
[31:29] names of god
[31:31] it's the name about all names god that
[31:33] god has ever had
[31:35] the name of jesus but you see it's not
[31:37] jesus only you know we have a
[31:39] nation uh of jesus only people you know
[31:41] the denomination of the
[31:43] uh uh it's called upc in the united
[31:46] states
[31:47] and others they call themselves
[31:48] apostolic church and they baptize in
[31:51] jesus name
[31:52] but you see we in the message have been
[31:54] made to understand is not only
[31:56] jesus it's not all that jesus only
[32:00] you know that name has been magnified
[32:03] and and then and in in acts chapter 2 he
[32:07] says that this
[32:08] jesus that you are crucified god has
[32:11] made him what
[32:12] both lord
[32:33] [Music]
[32:40] so accepted by saturday
[32:43] at six really
[32:46] yes go ahead say that
[32:50] all the householders where they are from
[32:52] you know assuredly that yoga has made
[32:55] him both lord
[32:56] and christ this jesus
[32:59] this jesus whom he crucified god has
[33:02] made him who
[33:03] both lord father
[33:06] and christ christ that's why balaam says
[33:09] in there he says that he was the lord of
[33:13] glory
[33:14] the almighty manifested in flesh the
[33:17] almighty manifested here
[33:19] he is god the father he is god the
[33:22] son he is not there holy ghost
[33:26] you see he's all of it hallelujah
[33:29] why because god was made manifest in
[33:32] flesh
[33:33] and god is all those titles these are
[33:35] just titles
[33:37] but his saving name you know there's a
[33:40] national record of overweightness and
[33:42] they their
[33:43] major teaching is but jesus is god his
[33:46] name is jehovah and they are for
[33:47] everybody
[33:47] calling god by another name they are
[33:49] wrong but you say we know that his name
[33:51] was jehovah
[33:52] and his name is steve jehovah you know
[33:55] but you see
[33:56] that is not the saving name of god
[33:59] because there's only
[34:00] one name whereby he has died there is
[34:03] only one name whether he has
[34:04] given himself to die and that name is
[34:06] called jesus christ
[34:08] amen that name is jesus and that name
[34:10] has revealed
[34:12] you see father son and one of us are
[34:14] just titles they are not names that is
[34:16] why we baptize in the name of
[34:18] the lord jesus christ for that
[34:21] is a name not a title it is the name of
[34:23] those titles just like you take a new
[34:25] one okay right
[34:26] now of course father is lord son is
[34:30] jesus holy spirit is christ and the name
[34:33] is lord
[34:34] jesus christ so it is wrong to bypass in
[34:36] jesus name
[34:38] and it is wrong also to be our place in
[34:40] father and holy spirit
[34:41] but it is right to baptize in the name
[34:43] of the lord jesus
[34:45] because that is the name hallelujah
[34:48] about
[34:48] your name and you were reading that part
[34:50] what did it say
[34:52] god has made him both christ
[34:56] lord and christ that was wonderful
[34:59] amen the father mentioned something
[35:01] about the sabbath do you mind giving us
[35:02] an exposition on that
[35:04] where did you read it how many have
[35:05] reached reached the apartment's vision

[35:31] let's wake up maybe i should stop these
[35:33] things of sampling we should go one by
[35:35] one
[35:36] and then we see what you have covered
[35:38] and what you want to say about what you
[35:40] have covered
[35:40] but i think we should keep the face
[35:42] because if you don't keep the best we
[35:43] shall not be able to finish this
[35:45] quickly because now we are still in the
[35:47] first chapter of the revelation of jesus
[35:48] christ
[35:49] okay brother you want to i do not know
[35:51] if it would be wise to go
[35:53] to the party must vision when nobody has
[35:55] reached there
[35:57] so can we push the partner's vision to
[36:00] the next
[36:01] uh tuesday meeting do you promise that

[36:27] we are not going to go back in the
[36:29] revelation of jesus christ so now today
[36:32] i want us to discuss anything in any
[36:34] part
[36:35] of the revelation of jesus christ
[36:37] whatever it is that is going on
[36:38] and maybe to inform you some of the
[36:40] questions that you send me
[36:42] uh please keep sending them keep sending
[36:43] them i uh
[36:45] i have uh informed a friend of mine a
[36:48] brother
[36:48] he's a very very good teacher bible
[36:50] teacher in this message i really
[36:52] appreciate him and his ministry
[36:54] when i was when i have just become a
[36:58] minister
[36:58] in this message i used to listen to all
[37:00] of his teachings and to read a lot of
[37:02] his notes
[37:03] and it really helped me to understand
[37:04] the message he's a brother he
[37:11] for them you remember the youth meeting
[37:12] we had yes
[37:14] so in uk so i'll be invited to him and
[37:17] i'll give him some of these questions
[37:18] and i'll ask him to deal
[37:20] with them directly with you so you give
[37:22] us a zoom on a day like this
[37:24] so uh keep those questions kind of those
[37:26] are tough i feel that we should be with
[37:28] directly
[37:29] those that i feel that you should deal
[37:31] with not that i cannot deal with them
[37:32] but
[37:33] i thought it would be good for you to
[37:35] hear from another voice
[37:36] usually it is very very beneficial
[37:42] so uh i need those questions to keep
[37:44] coming but don't don't stop
[37:46] bring them home bring them but don't ask
[37:48] anything ask things that matter
[37:50] ask substance amen
[37:54] okay sister peace if you're having
[37:56] problems with network
[37:58] that would mean that it is your network
[38:01] not our network and maybe

[38:30] now uh okay so uh
[38:33] for the question of uh the issue on the
[38:37] sabbath

[43:38] that is on christmas when they had this
[43:42] they were baptized in the name of the
[43:44] lord jesus
[43:46] and then and when paul had laid his
[43:49] hands upon them
[43:50] the holy ghost came on them
[44:07] john

[44:19] [Music]
[44:21] move back to jesus
[44:28] praise the lord that's uh accident one
[44:30] to six
[44:32] okay that's the purpose of the bible
[44:35] study
[44:36] you know we must be able you as a
[44:39] believer
[44:40] you must be able to highlight these
[44:42] scriptures
[44:43] in your bible i remember when i believed
[44:46] this message
[44:47] whatever i was reading was new to me so
[44:49] i had my bible
[44:50] it got old this is like the third bible
[44:53] since then
[44:54] this is my bible
[44:58] so whenever i see something
[45:01] that was so attaching to me or that i
[45:04] would
[45:04] use to witness to others i would say
[45:07] you know all these first pages and the
[45:09] last pages of my bible were
[45:11] full of scriptures here here
[45:15] all these pages were full of scriptures
[45:17] including the first
[45:18] pages here so what i would know some of
[45:22] the scriptures i know
[45:23] but even my hands are going to use that
[45:24] i guess
[45:26] because i'm witnessing to someone i will
[45:27] open it then i get there i read
[45:30] now sometimes i would forget because i
[45:32] do not know how to memorize those
[45:33] bible verses but i would know my handy
[45:36] would you know
[45:37] where to find it from i know that i
[45:39] would go like this
[45:40] just because i know i had marked it
[45:42] yellow already
[45:43] that's what i did in my head i quickly
[45:45] got there and then i said
[45:47] listen and then i read it for them and i
[45:49] tell you they would believe this message
[45:50] simply because
[45:51] i was marking my bible and knowing where
[45:53] the scriptures are
[45:55] and then also if i don't know where it
[45:56] is i would go i knew i had put my own
[45:59] reference
[46:00] back here and i put the bible verse
[46:02] that's why it is good to have
[46:03] a bible may i never god ashamed to walk
[46:06] with that bible
[46:07] if you're a christian and you are
[46:09] shocked with a bible then you are
[46:11] ashamed of christ
[46:12] sincerely you are ashamed of christ you
[46:14] do not deserve
[46:15] to be called a christian because this
[46:18] bible
[46:19] is our identification as christians can
[46:22] you
[46:23] get a shared recovery day you gotta fly
[46:25] no
[46:26] no one here unless you're not a ugandan
[46:29] you cannot be ashamed to call it you've
[46:30] got to fly
[46:32] you know not you can get ashamed to
[46:35] carry the
[46:36] jewish israelite flag no
[46:40] you know you but you you find the arabs
[46:43] burning the jewish flag because
[46:45] they don't identify themselves with them
[46:47] it's not their answer
[46:48] so our enzyme as christians one of those
[46:51] is the bible
[46:52] we should not be ashamed of carrying a
[46:54] bible some of you don't have
[46:56] my bibles not because you can't afford
[46:58] it because you're ashamed of carrying it
[47:00] how would they see me now in the bible
[47:03] those things
[47:04] ah if you're like that even as i'm
[47:08] speaking may god pull that spirit out of
[47:10] you
[47:10] and make he set you free so that you can
[47:12] be able to write
[47:13] the bible you know so i would market
[47:15] those things so now like this scripture
[47:17] that you have done your birth sister
[47:18] i would mark it mark it acts 19 i would
[47:21] know even now i know some of the
[47:22] scriptures because of those times when i
[47:24] just believe
[47:26] it stuck with me some of this will you
[47:29] can just speak and i'll just tell you
[47:30] it is right here i can even open that
[47:32] rookie because i know you see
[47:34] it is stuck with me in my heart even if
[47:36] you take the bible
[47:37] i know it is already i can't even recite
[47:39] it yeah
[47:40] paul was passing you know and then i
[47:42] tell you everything
[47:45] i i might not read it one by one to be
[47:47] accurate but
[47:48] i know the poor a discussion that
[47:51] did not be certain even many other
[47:53] verses there are some verses that you
[47:55] don't have
[47:56] to ask anybody to remind you where they
[47:58] are
[48:00] i can maybe challenge some of you now
[48:02] okay
[48:03] what is uh what does almost 37 say
[48:09] no if you don't reserve your hand no
[48:13] you know okay i must receive it
[48:17] you are not sure what does it say
[48:22] okay you are paraphrased why
[48:23] paraphrasing say it one for one
[48:27] okay can someone kind of sister prefer
[48:29] me
[48:32] now sisters you always will not allow
[48:34] you to preach but even here you can talk
[48:36] what is happening huh you why are you
[48:39] why are you putting it
[48:40] before they get it yeah can you now all
[48:42] of you read it one please let go
[48:54] the lord god will do nothing but your
[48:56] ability to sacrifice
[48:57] andrew's servants the prophets amen
[49:01] that one shows you that god must set a
[49:02] prophet when it is a mystery
[49:05] okay to be revealed okay that one you
[49:07] should know because you're going to
[49:08] tell the people that god has set a
[49:09] prophet in this generation
[49:11] amen you remember the scripture we read
[49:14] last time
[49:14] was it uh on when on when some of you
[49:16] would attend wednesday you missed
[49:18] by the way if you miss wellesley go back
[49:20] and listen to that youtube
[49:22] it will be a blessing to you excuse me
[49:24] now uh also
[49:25] uh we talked about
[50:00] okay anybody knows what it says
[50:03] these are the main scriptures that we
[50:05] must know give us the quarterback
[50:09] okay
[50:24] how
[50:38] what happened in those days
[50:44] [Music]
[50:49] what days are we talking about here
[50:52] the days of noah what are the days
[50:56] the days of sutton the days of now the
[50:57] days of sudden montgomery
[51:00] what happened they aired they married
[51:02] they drunk they gave me money they
[51:04] you know until you know i entered into
[51:05] the ark and the front came and
[51:09] likewise also as it was in the days of
[51:12] lord they did eat they drank they bought
[51:14] they saw they planted they built it
[51:16] verse 29
[51:18] you see but the same day that lord
[51:21] amen went out of sodom it rained fire
[51:23] and brimstone from heaven and destroyed
[51:25] them all
[51:26] so we're looking at two end times yes
[51:29] so even though it would be another end
[51:32] time
[51:33] and the things which were there at that
[51:35] time will also be there at that end time
[51:39] during that time then the son of man
[51:42] will be
[51:43] revealed and who is the son of man
[51:48] as
[52:00] yes you really missed if you did not get
[52:02] it
[52:03] it was jesus as a prophet he was
[52:06] revealed
[52:07] he he he came rather as a son of man a
[52:11] prophet
[52:11] but again he says he will be revealed
[52:13] again as a son of man
[52:16] in any time during a time like that and
[52:19] when is that time going to come
[52:22] for the hands from now on
[52:26] two years from now when is that end time
[52:51] oh jesus christ we're talking about the
[52:54] revealing of the son of man
[53:10] jesus already came on as a son of mine
[53:14] and that ministry finished now
[53:17] he's in the ministry of son of son of
[53:20] god son of god which is a goddess ghost
[53:23] dispensation
[53:25] we are waiting for him to come as a son
[53:27] of david as a judge now
[53:30] even the miranda is going to be sent
[53:31] them to judge to rule over
[53:34] but remember before he goes back to son
[53:37] of david
[53:38] before he reveals himself as son of
[53:40] deity
[53:41] before he does that the scripture tells
[53:43] us very clearly
[53:45] that he is praying what we have seen
[53:46] there you can actually
[53:48] predict again he is going to reveal
[53:50] himself
[53:51] again as son
[53:54] of man so he's the son of man
[53:59] then son of god then before he goes back
[54:02] to son of david
[54:04] he he again reveals himself as a
[54:07] man son of man remember he is not saying
[54:10] jesus is coming back again in flesh
[54:13] you understand me yes but son of man
[54:15] always means
[54:16] prophets so it means that that
[54:19] as he was on earth and he revealed
[54:21] himself in a prophetic ministry
[54:24] he will reveal himself again through a
[54:26] prophetic
[54:28] ministry before the millennium and the
[54:31] rapture
[54:32] all those things you understand and why
[54:34] did he reveal himself through
[54:36] our prophetic ministry
[54:40] when was that which prophetic ministry
[54:43] was that
[54:45] which ministry come on
[54:49] oh my my are you not sure about it
[54:53] by william branham his ministry was a
[54:55] prophetic minister according to almost 3
[54:58] 7 and revelation 10
[55:01] revelation 10 what does it say
[55:17] but in the days
[55:31] he has
[55:46] yeah so the
[55:49] the prophet the prophet
[55:52] he says that he's going to oh well
[55:54] please please here now
[55:56] the mystery of god was or is
[56:00] supposed to be finished
[56:03] by the ministry of the seventh
[56:07] angel the ministry of course after this
[56:11] of course we have the church book we are
[56:13] going to learn about the child ages and
[56:14] how they were going so
[56:16] we are still now talking about the
[56:17] revelation of jesus christ
[56:19] so the ministry
[56:22] hallelujah the ministry of the seventh
[56:27] angel is the ministry of the last day
[56:31] prophet can you all repeat those words
[56:40] exactly when i said the last day i mean
[56:43] the early times
[56:45] why when what are the end times when you
[56:47] do the world will be in the southern
[56:48] condition
[56:49] when the one who reject the prophets
[56:50] like they detected noah when the world
[56:52] was so much concerned about building
[56:54] marrying doing this and that kind of
[56:55] thing and during that time the end time
[56:57] god will raise a prophetic
[57:00] ministry and that prophetic ministry the
[57:02] member is always a minister of son of
[57:04] man
[57:06] son of man is a prophet like god was
[57:08] telling a second son a man prophesied to
[57:10] these bones
[57:10] you understand so that the ministry of
[57:13] son of man
[57:14] comes in the end time to reveal the
[57:16] mystery of
[57:18] god but remember the mystery of god
[57:21] is god himself the mystery of god
[57:24] is the word the mystery of god
[57:28] is jesus christ are you following it yes
[57:31] so when he says even it does in other
[57:34] words it will be in the early time
[57:37] it will be in the end of days when the
[57:39] son of man will
[57:41] be revealed again
[57:42] [Music]
[57:44] are we not at that time have you not
[57:46] arrived
[57:47] yes now who is the son of man not a son
[57:51] of man
[57:52] the son of man this son of man is who
[57:55] jesus jesus christ and he has revealed
[57:57] his mystery
[57:59] which means he has revealed himself and
[58:02] hearing it
[58:02] he has revealed himself through that is
[58:08] a
[58:08] a very big statement to make he has it
[58:11] if you
[58:12] because when you speak that way it is as
[58:14] if that
[58:15] was jesus was incarnate revealed
[58:18] where you understand but somebody
[58:20] someone else doesn't understand
[58:22] you see he was because there are some
[58:23] people say oh but i'm gonna come
[58:25] because there has been review to us you
[58:26] are jesus christ no that's not true
[58:28] okay no man is jesus christ okay but we
[58:31] are
[58:32] christ because christ is in us
[58:36] all right but we are not jesus christ
[58:39] there are many christs that shall come
[58:40] in the end
[58:41] which means false and holy ones we are
[58:44] christ because we are anointed
[58:46] but brother was like us but he was a
[58:49] prophet
[58:50] and and jesus christ
[58:53] revealed his himself through the
[58:57] ministry
[58:58] of the entire prophet of the end time
[59:01] era
[59:02] how through healing the sick
[59:05] through raising the dead and especially
[59:08] through the opening of my life
[59:11] through the disaster you see those
[59:13] things now
[59:15] by because at one point he said that
[59:17] this message is christ
[59:20] this message is christ if you don't
[59:23] fine-tune that and you don't
[59:25] take that through the spiritual mind
[59:27] you'll be like what does it mean
[59:29] the message being christ he is talking
[59:32] about
[59:33] the someone was asking me what is
[59:36] adoption
[59:37] that's a good question but i think i'll
[59:39] fall into the bath you see
[59:41] but adultery is a teaching right but
[59:44] then here we notice that the teachings
[59:46] that the the apostles taught the
[59:47] foundations of the gospel
[59:49] they said this which we have told to you
[59:52] this which will preach to you this is
[59:54] the foundation
[59:55] and no man can do that and they say this
[59:59] foundation which we have reg we'll say
[1:00:03] it is jesus christ
[1:00:06] that's what they say so in other words
[1:00:07] jesus christ is the word
[1:00:10] so the revealing the opening of the word
[1:00:12] is jesus christ
[1:00:14] when you receive this word when you
[1:00:15] believe this one you are receiving jesus
[1:00:17] christ
[1:00:18] how can you say you haven't said that
[1:00:20] just as my second has just come like a
[1:00:21] wind and enter you know
[1:00:23] you are receiving and accepting the word
[1:00:25] and opening your heart for him
[1:00:26] to come and dwell we even sing that song

[1:02:33] now you say that the the the holy spirit
[1:02:37] jesus christ through his word he has
[1:02:40] visited this generation again but you
[1:02:42] see
[1:02:42] his word is a revelation of himself
[1:02:47] so that's why the bottom table is this
[1:02:50] and the first chapter
[1:02:51] of the book of revelation the revelation
[1:02:53] of
[1:02:55] jesus christ it's all about the
[1:02:58] revelation of
[1:03:00] the oh my who took us through all that

[1:03:33] out of what you have read
[1:03:34] and anything that you might want to
[1:03:37] share with us
[1:03:41] if you don't have a book you can just

[1:05:16] can you read that box system
[1:05:34] children
[1:05:42] okay yeah it begins at 21. okay you can
[1:05:45] read and then
[1:05:46] tell us what you do not understand
[1:06:01] now there is a very favorite version of
[1:06:05] scripture
[1:06:07] that the trinitarians think
[1:06:11] pro think proof they put their point
[1:06:15] of more than one actual person in the
[1:06:20] good okay it's
[1:06:23] it is revelation 5
[1:06:27] chapter 6 to 8 and
[1:06:30] behave and look
[1:06:34] in the in the midst of the throne
[1:06:38] and of the forests and in the
[1:06:42] midst of the elders stood alone
[1:06:46] acids as it
[1:06:49] had been slain
[1:06:54] i've been having seven ones and seven
[1:06:57] eggs
[1:06:58] which are in seven spirits of god
[1:07:03] sent forth into all the
[1:07:06] hearts and he came and he came
[1:07:09] and took them and took
[1:07:13] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:07:16] of
[1:07:16] him that set upon that one
[1:07:21] and when he had taken the book
[1:07:24] the four beasts and and four
[1:07:29] and four and 20 elders
[1:07:32] fell down before the lamb having every
[1:07:35] one
[1:07:36] of them have and
[1:07:39] golden and golden veins fall off
[1:07:43] full of others
[1:07:47] which are the prayers of saints
[1:07:51] indeed these verses
[1:07:56] indeed in these verses
[1:08:00] if if isolated
[1:08:04] we would would seem to prove
[1:08:08] their point you
[1:08:11] you notice i said this isolated
[1:08:16] isolated verses however
[1:08:19] relation 4 2 3
[1:08:22] and 9 to 11
[1:08:27] and immediately i was in the spirit
[1:08:30] and behold the throne was set in heaven
[1:08:34] and one set on the throne and he
[1:08:38] and he that sat was to
[1:08:42] look upon like they just
[1:08:45] and they and the sudden
[1:08:48] sedan stone and there was a rainbow
[1:08:52] from round about the throne inside
[1:08:57] inside like and two
[1:09:01] and two emerald and when this
[1:09:04] beast give
[1:09:07] glory and honor and chance to him
[1:09:11] stream that sight on the sun
[1:09:14] who lives with oliver's
[1:09:17] with with ever and heaven
[1:09:21] the four and 20 elders
[1:09:27] fall down before him that sat on the
[1:09:30] throne
[1:09:31] and worshipped him that leave it
[1:09:34] forever and even and cast their crew
[1:09:38] and pass their throne before the throne
[1:09:41] saying thou had worthy
[1:09:44] or lord to receive glory and honest
[1:09:47] and power for thou hast created
[1:09:51] all things and for
[1:09:54] thy pleasure they have
[1:09:58] and we are created carefully
[1:10:02] not in not in verse two it says
[1:10:06] one not two or three
[1:10:09] but one sat on the throne
[1:10:14] in verse 3 it says he
[1:10:18] not they was to look upon
[1:10:22] as like as a justice as a dispersal
[1:10:27] in verse 9 it says that
[1:10:30] the beast gave honor to him
[1:10:34] but not them in verse 10 it says
[1:10:37] that the elders fell down before him
[1:10:41] today in verse 11 it says
[1:10:45] they they cried thou had
[1:10:48] to worry all lord not all lords
[1:10:53] also in verse 11 it says
[1:10:57] this one
[1:11:00] on the on the throne was on the throne
[1:11:04] was the creator which is
[1:11:08] jesus john
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:11] 1 john 1 verse 3
[1:11:16] which is jehovah spirit
[1:11:19] god of the old testament genesis 1
[1:11:25] okay so what is the point of configuring
[1:11:28] audience
[1:11:30] the confusion is in
[1:11:34] that relationship six to eight
[1:11:41] what is it that is confusing you in
[1:11:43] revelation five six to eight
[1:11:47] i think he was talking about
[1:12:02] i think you want to look at that can you
[1:12:04] give us a quote
[1:12:06] therefore bc
[1:12:19] notice but according to jesus himself
[1:12:22] who wrote the revelation he sat down
[1:12:26] with the father the spirit in paul which
[1:12:29] is the spirit of christ
[1:12:30] which is the spirit of christ for that
[1:12:33] is the spirit of prophets whereby words
[1:12:35] comes
[1:12:36] says he is set down at the right hand of
[1:12:39] god
[1:12:39] but when john looked he saw only one
[1:12:42] upon the throne
[1:12:43] and it was not until revelation five six
[1:12:45] to eight which you're not talking about
[1:12:47] which follows revelation 4 2-3 in
[1:12:50] sequence of time
[1:12:53] but there that we see the lamb
[1:12:57] taking the book from him that sat on the
[1:13:00] throne
[1:13:01] as indicated in revelation 4 2 3 9
[1:13:04] 2 10. what is it it is the mystery
[1:13:09] of one god he
[1:13:12] jesus came out from god
[1:13:16] that's what he means he jesus came out
[1:13:19] from god
[1:13:21] became manifested in the flesh
[1:13:24] died and rose again and returned to the
[1:13:28] blossom of the father
[1:13:31] as john said the only begotten son which
[1:13:34] is in the bosom of their
[1:13:36] father we talked about because at the
[1:13:38] other time
[1:13:39] he has declared him john 1
[1:13:43] 18 says it was not now time for god the
[1:13:46] messiah
[1:13:47] to come back to claim his bride and then
[1:13:49] present himself
[1:13:51] to make himself known to israel that's
[1:13:53] receivable against stepping forward to
[1:13:55] assume a physical relationship to
[1:13:57] a man as the son of david king of kings
[1:14:00] and lord of lords
[1:14:01] the bridegroom praise the lord
[1:14:05] amen see it says uh the the the the
[1:14:08] okay the bridegroom of the gentile bride
[1:14:11] it is not two gods
[1:14:12] but simply one god manifesting is mighty
[1:14:16] listen to that he is mighty to ruin
[1:14:20] true offices and
[1:14:24] titles does anyone understand that
[1:14:26] question
[1:14:27] yes he's almighty god the god mighty god
[1:14:31] manifesting his mighty train
[1:14:35] offices and idols
[1:14:39] you see the people knew he was a prophet
[1:14:41] they knew the sign of the messiah
[1:14:43] which could only come through the
[1:14:45] prophet and blah blah blah
[1:14:46] so he's trying to compare revelation 5
[1:14:51] and revelation 4 saying revelation 5
[1:14:54] only follows revelation 4.
[1:14:58] and as you have seen here revelation
[1:15:01] 4 is speaking of
[1:15:04] the hymn that was on the throne
[1:15:07] and then the lamb and then the airless
[1:15:11] around the throne and then and uh you
[1:15:14] know he was sitting on the throne and
[1:15:15] then the
[1:15:15] elders were around the throne and then
[1:15:18] the beasts and
[1:15:18] giving glory and honor to him that some
[1:15:20] of the throne and
[1:15:22] then he talks about revelation 5
[1:15:28] where is the version 5
[1:15:31] yes revelation 5 which also says
[1:15:34] in the midst of the throne of the forbis
[1:15:36] and the
[1:15:42] revelation 5 is a continuity is a
[1:15:45] continuation of revelation
[1:15:47] chapter 4. he's not talking about two
[1:15:49] gods here
[1:15:50] he's talking about one god but
[1:15:54] manifesting his offices at different
[1:15:57] times
[1:15:58] look at it this way
[1:16:01] uh do you know what other one you've
[1:16:04] seen what did god do
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:16] when adam and eve sinned everyone is
[1:16:18] free to talk
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:46] okay now you know
[1:16:50] these are some of the things you're not
[1:16:51] going to read
[1:16:54] in the bible but it is there okay
[1:16:58] if you are the reader but if you are you
[1:17:00] gotta
[1:17:09] very good question without revelation
[1:17:11] you can't
[1:17:12] understand anything in the bible
[1:17:17] make sure you remind me when i forget
[1:17:19] where we were headed
[1:17:20] i wanted to talk about what god did when
[1:17:23] he came down right
[1:17:24] okay so we are reading that in genesis
[1:17:39] yes and adam verse 20
[1:17:43] call his wife's name eve but i don't
[1:17:45] know what it means
[1:17:49] which means what
[1:17:51] [Music]
[1:17:53] because she was the mother of all
[1:17:56] you know what matter of all living means
[1:17:59] that's other meaningful of all living
[1:18:04] father of all living and and if he's man
[1:18:07] of all living what does it mean
[1:18:24] get ready you know when we said that eve
[1:18:27] means man of origin but adam doesn't
[1:18:29] mean
[1:18:30] father of all liberty because eve
[1:18:32] mattered more than the sons of adam
[1:18:35] even under the shooting of the suffering
[1:18:36] also
[1:18:38] that is king kenya was not the son of
[1:18:41] adam
[1:18:42] i hope all of you know that already by
[1:18:44] now but uh
[1:18:45] but uh but but adam was only father of
[1:18:51] of so he wasn't the father
[1:19:06] did the lord make the call make courts
[1:19:09] of skin
[1:19:11] and clothed them hallelujah
[1:19:15] now the question is brother somewhere
[1:19:18] what did the bible say
[1:19:34] is
[1:19:48] is there's a difference
[1:19:51] between making and creating
[1:19:55] he's not saying cut some skill appear
[1:19:58] no but it meant how do you make a court
[1:20:02] of skin for you to dress yourself up
[1:20:07] by killing a cow or by getting a sheep
[1:20:11] or a goat okay so you make a skin
[1:20:15] out of a living animal which you you
[1:20:18] have to keep first
[1:20:20] are you following me so now have you
[1:20:21] seen the scripture
[1:20:23] oh no now saints please follow me here
[1:20:26] we have to be in one account
[1:20:28] hey this brother stupid i never knew it
[1:20:31] was there
[1:20:32] now you have seen it all right now
[1:20:35] friends
[1:20:36] after god makes them this one is
[1:20:38] symbolic also
[1:20:40] because my just feel nice whenever
[1:20:43] i i come to scriptures like this which i
[1:20:45] have a lot of revelation upon them
[1:20:48] jesus was represented within this course
[1:20:52] of scheme
[1:20:54] the course of skill addressed them was
[1:20:57] symbolizing
[1:20:58] jesus christ because it's our court of
[1:21:01] skills
[1:21:02] he is the one that dresses us he's the
[1:21:05] one that clothes us
[1:21:07] he says the other sense they came up in
[1:21:10] white
[1:21:11] white in what's relevant
[1:21:15] in what clauses it's in the book of
[1:21:17] revelation and he says this means the
[1:21:20] righteousness of the saints but when we
[1:21:23] get our righteousness
[1:21:24] we do not have our own righteousness our
[1:21:26] righteousness is not ours it is god's
[1:21:28] righteousness that he places upon us so
[1:21:31] you can now see
[1:21:32] that the righteousness of god comes by
[1:21:34] what
[1:21:35] the righteousness of god comes by the
[1:21:38] shading of the blood
[1:21:39] and the bible says without the shedding
[1:21:41] of blood there is no remission of
[1:21:43] sin so if your sins are still on you how
[1:21:45] can you sell your righteousness
[1:21:47] you now see that the righteousness of
[1:21:49] that we have
[1:21:50] of the saints is really the
[1:21:52] righteousness of the
[1:21:53] lamb of god and who is the lamb of god
[1:21:57] he is symbolized in islam which god came
[1:21:59] down and they
[1:22:00] and squeezed and killed and the cross
[1:22:03] that came out of it was the
[1:22:04] righteousness that came out of the land
[1:22:06] are you following me now we see a lamb
[1:22:09] here and we see
[1:22:10] the cross of skin that came out of it so
[1:22:12] we see jesus christ being the lamb
[1:22:14] and we see the righteousness that comes
[1:22:17] comes out of him
[1:22:18] when he died on the cross of calgary
[1:22:19] which we now receive which we are now
[1:22:22] beneficial is all but at this time it
[1:22:24] was adam physically
[1:22:26] a beneficiary of those gods of skins but
[1:22:29] who died
[1:22:31] god or the lamb the lamb
[1:22:34] now you may say but the lamb and god are
[1:22:36] different if he's gonna kill you
[1:22:38] but you know the battle says that
[1:22:41] you you don't know how it must have
[1:22:43] failed
[1:22:45] when he was on the cross crying my
[1:22:48] father my father why are you forsaking
[1:22:50] me
[1:22:51] he said the father looked the other side
[1:22:55] why madam says that their father looked
[1:22:58] the other side as jesus died on the
[1:23:01] cross
[1:23:03] no angel came back to help him because
[1:23:05] he is the father and there is now jesus
[1:23:07] there are two gods no remember
[1:23:11] jesus was white the one
[1:23:15] and the one was with god but now here
[1:23:18] the word was man
[1:23:19] it was an attribute of god manifested it
[1:23:21] doesn't mean that god is not quenched in
[1:23:23] heaven
[1:23:25] now look at it this way who created
[1:23:28] islam
[1:23:29] in genesis how was it formulated
[1:23:33] was it murdered out of mind how was it
[1:23:36] made
[1:23:38] she was a spoken word of god now this
[1:23:40] lamb was a
[1:23:42] spoken word of god and in the same way
[1:23:44] god spoke that lamb
[1:23:46] where was it before it was spoken it was
[1:23:49] with god
[1:23:51] so it was a path of god so by god
[1:23:53] killing it he was killing
[1:23:55] himself he was killing it was his
[1:23:58] creation
[1:23:58] that's why the bible hallelujah because
[1:24:00] jesus christ the
[1:24:02] beginning of the new creation of god
[1:24:05] because he was created the flesh as in
[1:24:08] speaking the flesh the lamb was greeted
[1:24:10] the flesh
[1:24:11] was created it was created the flesh was
[1:24:15] but the spirit in him was not created
[1:24:18] that's why
[1:24:18] he is called the priest of the most high
[1:24:21] god
[1:24:21] medicated who had no beginning of days
[1:24:24] and who had no
[1:24:25] end of days with him there is no
[1:24:27] beginning and no ending of days he is
[1:24:30] god himself a channel but remember the
[1:24:33] sun had a beginning
[1:24:34] and the sun will happen so we are not we
[1:24:37] whenever talking about god you must see
[1:24:41] through jesus don't look at the man
[1:24:46] see through jesus and be able to know
[1:24:49] that
[1:24:50] the father was he reconciling the world
[1:24:53] back to himself
[1:24:54] praise the name of the lord so the lamb
[1:24:56] and god at the same time
[1:24:58] i hope that answers your questions or
[1:25:01] are you still confused
[1:25:05] and if you if you do not understand it
[1:25:08] means
[1:25:08] i answered another question so you need
[1:25:11] to tell me exactly
[1:25:13] which area is completed
[1:25:18] you are still going to eat but you went
[1:25:20] so far i went so far
[1:25:23] and you left what you are going to okay
[1:25:26] you are asking me do you know how
[1:25:28] what happened to adam and eve when they
[1:25:30] were in the garden of eden
[1:25:32] yes you were going to that answer but
[1:25:34] you weren't so funny left
[1:25:36] yes okay can i come back why do you want
[1:25:38] me to come back now
[1:25:41] what had happened to adam and eve i
[1:25:43] wanted to show you is that they sing
[1:25:46] and when they sing god killed a lamb
[1:25:51] and the course of skin of the lamb saved
[1:25:54] them from seed
[1:25:56] the point is cover them yes all right
[1:26:00] the lamb acids as
[1:26:03] it had been slain having seven uns and
[1:26:07] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:26:12] of god sent forth
[1:26:15] into the house
[1:26:18] so your point is the seven spirits of
[1:26:21] god
[1:26:22] that is what is confusing you
[1:26:26] the seven spirits of god is not seven
[1:26:28] speakers you hear each seven spirits
[1:26:30] god is a spirit one spirit
[1:26:33] but you see these are seven spirits
[1:26:37] meaning one spirit in each age
[1:26:40] one spirit in each eight for seven edges
[1:26:45] the same holy spirit divided in seven
[1:26:48] ages that's why i said it said that
[1:26:50] doesn't mean certain spirit as in
[1:26:52] god has one spirit to speak to the
[1:26:53] spirit's prosperity no it's just like
[1:26:55] when you say
[1:26:56] seven church ages or seven churches yeah
[1:26:59] the bible says seven churches
[1:27:01] in asia he mentions them ephesians
[1:27:06] so it doesn't mean that there are
[1:27:07] several churches does he have seven
[1:27:09] churches no
[1:27:10] he has one church but that one church
[1:27:13] is represented in every age
[1:27:16] for seven agents that's why we call it
[1:27:18] seven churches
[1:27:19] seven church edges because there are
[1:27:22] seven edges
[1:27:24] of the same church seven
[1:27:27] edges where the same holy spirit
[1:27:31] he's working maybe we can get something
[1:27:35] about this about the seven spirits
[1:27:44] yes
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:49] okay tell me what part you think i left
[1:27:53] because since most of you know that i
[1:27:55] did not finish that point oh yes
[1:28:00] unless there's something you thought i
[1:28:02] had left out but i think i
[1:28:04] did finish what i wanted to say
[1:28:09] okay
[1:28:13] there's a quote i'm looking for and i'll
[1:28:14] read it later but while i'm looking for
[1:28:16] it
[1:28:17] i think we're waiting for sister to say
[1:28:19] something then i'm coming to you brother
[1:28:21] uh uh brother but first
[1:28:31] okay before you you you say you're going
[1:28:34] to speak
[1:28:35] i wanted to start this quote for me
[1:28:37] quickly it is a decent church age
[1:28:39] but not in the church in the
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:54] uh
[1:29:05] are we rich um
[1:29:10] okay yes in that message such in this
[1:29:12] message now
[1:29:14] the seven spirits the seven spirits
[1:29:18] uh
[1:29:21] the seven spirits and the seven stars
[1:29:23] the spirits was the angels that
[1:29:24] went to the stars which were messengers
[1:29:28] seven spirits
[1:29:29] seven different times the holy spirit
[1:29:31] would anoint a messenger
[1:29:35] okay seven different times there was
[1:29:38] another message which was a star in his
[1:29:42] day
[1:29:42] a spirit is a tunnel and the star was
[1:29:45] made for a purpose to reflect right in
[1:29:47] the dark
[1:29:48] of the church ages when candles and
[1:29:50] stars
[1:29:51] represented the angel of the spirit was
[1:29:53] the one that went
[1:29:55] to the star and reflected the star
[1:29:58] of the holy spirit through the star
[1:30:01] to that church age you see when you talk
[1:30:04] about the star
[1:30:06] we're talking about a messenger but
[1:30:08] these stars
[1:30:09] did not work or by themselves they had
[1:30:12] spirit a spirit that was driving them
[1:30:15] and that spirit is the spirit of jesus
[1:30:17] christ
[1:30:18] the holy spirit so when it talks about
[1:30:21] the seven species you might wonder who
[1:30:22] the seven spirits are
[1:30:24] it is the seven messengers
[1:30:27] of the seven church ages
[1:30:31] uh now each time that the star came on
[1:30:34] the scene
[1:30:35] the holy spirit came down and anointed
[1:30:38] that star
[1:30:40] and he kept it just exactly like the
[1:30:42] first one was now before we even
[1:30:45] continue this line
[1:30:46] sister i want you to understand that the
[1:30:48] book of revelation
[1:30:50] is the book of symbols you read
[1:30:53] something
[1:30:54] it's not exactly the way you picture it
[1:30:56] in your mind
[1:30:57] it means completely something else for
[1:31:00] instance
[1:31:00] i'll give you an example of the churches
[1:31:02] i will also give you the example of a
[1:31:04] woman the bible said a woman
[1:31:05] and i saw a woman sitting on many waters
[1:31:10] and talks about the horns and everything
[1:31:12] so you are like
[1:31:13] ah this woman is this
[1:31:22] a woman means church so that's why we
[1:31:25] need a prophet because a prophet comes
[1:31:27] with the holy spirit
[1:31:28] by the holy spirit by the power of the
[1:31:30] holy spirit to interpret
[1:31:33] the scripture the scripture it's not the
[1:31:35] prophet in the preaching now
[1:31:37] it is because by the man and preacher
[1:31:39] and he says god interprets his own word
[1:31:41] so god by the holy spirit
[1:31:44] in the priests that work through a
[1:31:47] prophet
[1:31:48] because he will not speak to everyone in
[1:31:49] the sky you know
[1:31:51] many people come say that god has spoken
[1:31:53] to them but yet god never spoke so in
[1:31:55] every generation you will have to send
[1:31:57] one man with the message of that
[1:32:00] generation and he will anoint him
[1:32:02] with a necessary anointing and
[1:32:04] revelation
[1:32:05] for that generation praise the lord
[1:32:08] all that these things make sense to you
[1:32:12] okay now sister you all ready
[1:32:16] yeah you already have been waiting i've
[1:32:18] been waiting
[1:32:20] okay go for it
[1:32:41] if you answer something not right now
[1:32:45] not right now okay
[1:32:48] oh no
[1:32:53] yes and what you would like to teach us
[1:32:55] actually now
[1:32:56] yeah this is drawing first the flow is
[1:32:59] yours
[1:33:01] please can you put the camera on
[1:33:06] rather
[1:33:21] these these pictures using their
[1:33:23] instrument
[1:33:25] saying that each of these
[1:33:29] ages such english and they come with an
[1:33:31] angel
[1:33:32] of different things
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:16] in his mother's womb and backwards
[1:34:21] because he was an angel he also came to
[1:34:23] us
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:29] so him also he had to
[1:34:35] now uh what was your conclusion and
[1:34:37] where do you find that conclusion
[1:34:39] in the book which you have
[1:34:43] do you have you have a question you want
[1:34:45] to leave for us
[1:34:46] no question you want to read and was
[1:34:49] your question answered
[1:34:52] not yet yes so you just told me
[1:34:58] so you just told me that when you get
[1:35:00] the message you get the holy ghost
[1:35:03] no that's what that's what that's what
[1:35:06] you thought
[1:35:12] because
[1:35:15] okay so right now do you know how to
[1:35:17] receive the holy spirit
[1:35:25] oh okay i do not know who explained this
[1:35:29] to you but
[1:35:30] let me try to make some things clear
[1:35:32] here please go and listen to
[1:35:34] the wednesday service i answered this
[1:35:36] question in detail
[1:35:39] i i i cannot see a mistake i answered it
[1:35:43] in detail
[1:35:43] you can go for one for what until you
[1:35:45] get to that question i think about that

[1:36:18] mindset

[1:36:46] that oh you know we're so busy and we
[1:36:48] pray and we're really and we do not even
[1:36:57] you say god has placed us here to be
[1:37:01] a witness me and the rest of the
[1:37:04] brothers who have abandoned we are going
[1:37:06] to do all that we can do
[1:37:08] anyone who will not be saved which will
[1:37:10] be out to them
[1:37:11] but they will not say we never right we
[1:37:13] never had
[1:37:14] we never had anyone to encourage us
[1:37:17] whenever god has lead us here to
[1:37:18] encourage you to encourage one another
[1:37:20] amen so you have a phone

[1:37:26] than one whatsapp group some of them
[1:37:27] even have to personally believe them

[1:37:35] through
[1:37:35] me i had even to remove my uh you see
[1:37:38] even when you send me a message and
[1:37:40] whatsapp and i don't answer you quickly

[1:37:43] notifications anymore i told you
[1:37:44] don't send me any notification i will
[1:37:47] read what's up
[1:37:48] when i have the time to so when i i i

[1:37:53] came
[1:37:54] until i get my phone i have a time to
[1:37:56] read and then
[1:37:57] respond so because it was getting too
[1:38:00] much
[1:38:01] you never do anything that you say let
[1:38:02] me read this scripture
[1:38:04] what did he say you you just you get the
[1:38:07] bible and i just like it the words of
[1:38:09] almost
[1:38:10] okay wait by the time you say
[1:38:28] who was a manga they admitted
[1:38:32] you see that's how you are hey this
[1:38:34] thing is going to get ahold of me i
[1:38:36] decided to do what
[1:38:37] remove these notifications but now with
[1:38:40] you
[1:38:41] and you are young you see your younger
[1:38:43] people
[1:38:44] what are you doing with your whatsapp
[1:38:46] honestly speaking
[1:38:47] yeah if it is not uh the
[1:38:50] the things of god and someone was like
[1:38:54] ah
[1:38:55] you're spiritualizing everything now
[1:38:58] if everything about you is not about
[1:39:00] christ and then what what
[1:39:02] what is the purpose of your life what is
[1:39:04] the purpose of your life
[1:39:05] huh i told you you know i told you to
[1:39:08] watch that
[1:39:09] video i don't know if you also shared it
[1:39:10] with others did you share with them
[1:39:13] a video of the father who is a
[1:39:16] millionaire he's a billionaire not a
[1:39:18] millionaire
[1:39:18] billionaire one of the richest man in
[1:39:20] africa here
[1:39:23] but when he begins to preach this
[1:39:25] message
[1:39:26] he swears he's speaking thanks
[1:39:30] he jumps and shouts i don't hear what he
[1:39:33] say
[1:39:34] he even goes and preaches it on the
[1:39:36] street without a speaker
[1:39:39] even with the speaker think you're
[1:39:40] talking with the speaker speaking this
[1:39:42] is like us here takes it there begins
[1:39:45] talking and shouting and preaching his
[1:39:46] message
[1:39:47] sweating like this and you know it was
[1:39:49] very hard
[1:39:50] but he doesn't okay and yes
[1:39:54] money money just records that into
[1:39:56] answers
[1:39:57] and yet he is not there saying ah i have
[1:40:00] a gift for god and these things and
[1:40:02] you you are saying i want to really be
[1:40:03] rich i want to be that i want to be that
[1:40:05] but you have no time for god
[1:40:07] and someone who has all those things has
[1:40:09] more than god than you who does
[1:40:11] who doesn't have anything that is the
[1:40:13] key to give this do you think you are
[1:40:14] busy
[1:40:14] there are people who are busy this the
[1:40:16] kind of man i'm talking about
[1:40:18] the men who make appointments with the
[1:40:20] leaders of the world
[1:40:22] i'm told that yeah even a place that you
[1:40:24] will come and
[1:40:25] uh one day that i think they made an
[1:40:27] appointment with the president
[1:40:28] or someone was i think that the prime
[1:40:30] minister
[1:40:32] was making an appointment with his uh
[1:40:34] with his
[1:40:35] comfort i think to buy some cars because
[1:40:37] it sells brand new cars
[1:40:39] and um and uh you know that was the time
[1:40:41] when he
[1:40:42] was supposed to be at church he wrote
[1:40:44] him back and he said
[1:40:45] i am sorry i have enough another
[1:40:48] appointment
[1:40:49] that same time so i cannot miss it he
[1:40:52] never
[1:40:53] he missed the other appointment because
[1:40:54] what he gave me more important was the
[1:40:56] appointment with god
[1:40:58] so young people i'm wondering if we have
[1:41:00] not reached that level how do we expect
[1:41:02] god to bless us
[1:41:03] in the realms of those people that god
[1:41:04] has blessed i'm talking about blessings
[1:41:06] of the world
[1:41:08] if you want the blessings of the world
[1:41:09] might go faster in your life
[1:41:11] give you the first period and uh i i
[1:41:14] told you
[1:41:15] also of the meetings that i went in a
[1:41:17] nigerian
[1:41:18] this place i don't know i went to a
[1:41:20] place called oshogo
[1:41:21] in nigeria and i found this you know in
[1:41:24] the chat
[1:41:25] you know i found this great king you
[1:41:26] know is the king
[1:41:28] she comes with a million of cars and
[1:41:29] then and that is so far then
[1:41:32] you know like that you know he believed
[1:41:35] the message
[1:41:36] he believed the message but this man i
[1:41:38] told you what's kings even i think here
[1:41:39] in uganda i don't know if
[1:41:41] it is also customary and the kings are
[1:41:42] not supposed to be moving nigeria
[1:41:44] their hearts they're not supposed to
[1:41:46] look at their on the top of their head
[1:41:48] it is a taboo even when the kid goes to
[1:41:52] the
[1:41:52] church because with some of these chiefs
[1:41:55] you know the nigerian ships
[1:41:56] and they don't allow him to do anything
[1:41:58] that would have shaped the kingdom
[1:42:00] and or anything but the man of god one
[1:42:02] mother
[1:42:03] was saying i said one mother you're not
[1:42:04] having these big drums
[1:42:06] so he said bye
[1:42:09] when the morning comes you know how the
[1:42:11] nigerians say oh when
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:37] and you know how they can do it you know
[1:42:39] they don't have to dance you know
[1:42:55] so he removed the top and there and he
[1:42:58] also removed the hat
[1:43:00] you now know dancing is about to get
[1:43:02] started the
[1:43:03] man in dust and sweating i'm sure he
[1:43:06] must have contained it with
[1:43:07] the chiefs when he went back but he had
[1:43:09] i had an interview with him
[1:43:12] he told me i had to dance for god god is
[1:43:14] priority number one in my life number
[1:43:15] one
[1:43:16] we must respect god i said what this is
[1:43:19] a king
[1:43:20] a king i'm talking about a king who owns
[1:43:22] a domain but yeah
[1:43:24] he can handle himself and give good time
[1:43:27] number one he came to church
[1:43:28] number two he can dance so i'm talking
[1:43:30] about what if you want god embrace you
[1:43:32] with your life
[1:43:33] make good number one first period so
[1:43:35] surely you have a phone and you have a
[1:43:37] whatsapp and they
[1:43:38] have i have not even been seeing anyone
[1:43:39] personally i'm not saying you should
[1:43:40] post today
[1:43:41] you'll notice that no what i'm saying is
[1:43:44] you know god watches your heart what is
[1:43:46] it that really steals your heart
[1:43:48] if you are going into other groups and
[1:43:50] they're chatting with them it shows you
[1:43:52] that the people you are working with
[1:43:54] the people you are relating with are not
[1:43:56] the right people
[1:43:57] you what proves you what attracts you is
[1:44:00] the world and not the things of god
[1:44:02] because the things of god you are like
[1:44:03] you give it up you can wait but god
[1:44:05] you think can wait and then the rest of

[1:46:11] like this one
[1:46:13] even though my ipad was there my ipad
[1:46:16] was there
[1:46:17] did i did you see it yet it was broken
[1:46:19] broken some of you may be sorry
[1:46:21] i don't want to keep going through that
[1:46:22] because i will now kill our time here
[1:46:25] and i have we have about 20 minutes to
[1:46:28] finish if we have to go back home so
[1:46:30] look i tell you i i yeah everything
[1:46:33] broke and
[1:46:34] whatever but god has a god knew that
[1:46:38] whatever i get i use it for his name
[1:46:41] whether it is a house a car or whatever
[1:46:43] or whatever
[1:46:44] you understand a phone even a dress
[1:46:50] even a bible whatever you get in your
[1:46:53] life
[1:46:54] you must use it for the glory of the
[1:46:56] name of
[1:46:57] god so that's how god give me this
[1:47:00] if you give me this thing god if you
[1:47:03] give me this thing
[1:47:06] i'm going to
[1:47:21] because already god knows your heart if
[1:47:23] he gives you not what
[1:47:25] you will not serve him but let me tell
[1:47:28] you there is nothing i've ever prayed
[1:47:30] before the lord i told him god gave me
[1:47:31] this if you give it to my music
[1:47:33] and he never gave me until now i
[1:47:36] challenge you there is nothing
[1:47:38] so you ask whether you ask for an
[1:47:40] airplane i've never asked for it
[1:47:42] because i don't have faith for it but
[1:47:45] whatever i have asked you for
[1:47:48] what has given it god has given it to me
[1:47:52] and i mean whatever
[1:47:56] brother whatever whatever you ask for
[1:47:59] the lord
[1:48:00] he will give it to you if your motive is
[1:48:04] right if you you say now some of you are
[1:48:06] saying give us examples of some of those
[1:48:08] things
[1:48:09] can i give you some examples the very
[1:48:11] first example is my wife
[1:48:14] we were not married and so i learned
[1:48:16] that
[1:48:17] i went to prayer
[1:48:22] i said you know where i am you know how
[1:48:25] old i was i think i was
[1:48:26] 80 yeah i was 18
[1:48:30] but i saw i loved that at 18 do you
[1:48:33] think i had money to mine
[1:48:35] i didn't have money tomorrow i didn't
[1:48:36] have anything i get out of my house i
[1:48:38] didn't
[1:48:38] have it you understand i didn't even
[1:48:41] have money to free that up
[1:48:43] so i had nothing but god said he will
[1:48:45] give his beloved
[1:48:47] you know whatever it is a desire
[1:48:49] whatsoever that you desire
[1:48:50] so i wrote a prayer i said oh god give
[1:48:53] her to me
[1:48:58] amen
[1:49:13] to check my application
[1:49:19] god had gone before me god had already
[1:49:23] submitted the application before i even
[1:49:25] what
[1:49:25] before i even you understand
[1:49:28] so when you take god fasting everything
[1:49:31] god
[1:49:31] makes you sure whatever and are you
[1:49:34] telling me if you are taking this
[1:49:35] in this meeting like taking whatever you
[1:49:39] asked
[1:49:39] for god gives it to you if your motive
[1:49:42] is right
[1:49:44] if whatever you're going to use in your
[1:49:46] life whatever you want the lord to give
[1:49:48] if you want god to give you
[1:49:49] a bachelor's degree or a master's degree
[1:49:51] or a phd
[1:49:53] if he knows you are going to use it for
[1:49:55] his glory and i'm talking about if you
[1:49:56] are his child
[1:49:57] but those who are not his children he
[1:49:59] doesn't care whatever they want they get
[1:50:01] no problem their heaven is here but but
[1:50:04] if you're a child of god
[1:50:05] hey if your child will go and you are
[1:50:08] and your mother
[1:50:10] you will ask for things you never get
[1:50:11] because you're a child of god
[1:50:13] he loves he doesn't want you to be
[1:50:14] spoiled if i find out elizabeth
[1:50:17] here and she says that he said yes yeah
[1:50:19] and that praise
[1:50:20] can you buy me a brand new car
[1:50:24] i'll just look at her because it's all
[1:50:25] right dear i need it now
[1:50:27] it's all right dear just reports can i
[1:50:30] get by for her
[1:50:32] i'll just waste her how can i some
[1:50:34] parents do
[1:50:35] shell is excuse nine years and you buy
[1:50:37] them a cat
[1:50:38] you are spoiling the child they will
[1:50:40] never have a future of their own you
[1:50:42] understand
[1:50:43] so if you like your child you will not
[1:50:45] do certain things for them
[1:50:46] because you know their motive is not
[1:50:48] right
[1:50:49] okay so if you have ever asked for
[1:50:51] something and god never gave it to you
[1:50:54] check your motives it is your motives
[1:50:56] always so whatever it is that you desire
[1:50:58] god must give it to you if your motive
[1:51:00] is right what are we talking about
[1:51:02] in these 15 minutes what was it that you
[1:51:05] read about
[1:51:07] yes yes
[1:51:12] so what what what started us off in this
[1:51:18] direction
[1:51:24] yes go and listen to that video we
[1:51:26] already answered that question
[1:51:28] and this issue of saying that when you
[1:51:30] receive the message you receive the holy
[1:51:31] ghost is not right
[1:51:34] it is not right never believe it because
[1:51:36] if you believe it you are born
[1:51:38] you will be called forever and i think i
[1:51:41] should
[1:51:42] support the scripture give us acts
[1:51:43] chapter 19.
[1:51:57] uh-huh are you there last night max
[1:52:00] chapter 19
[1:52:01] from verse one uh uh-huh
[1:52:04] acts 19 from verse one we are reading
[1:52:07] uh can you pull it from me on the screen
[1:52:09] here as well
[1:52:12] oh you are off okay let me try to get
[1:52:15] one just try to
[1:52:16] get back and do it later okay ah no no
[1:52:19] the meeting is gone
[1:52:21] i can see you're on oh
[1:52:31] okay right there
[1:52:34] now he says that it came to pass that
[1:52:37] where aparos was at curry
[1:52:38] poor having passed through the upper
[1:52:40] costs came to ephesus and finding seven
[1:52:42] disciples first two
[1:52:44] he said unto them have he received the
[1:52:47] holy ghost sincerely belief
[1:52:48] and they said unto him we have not so
[1:52:51] much
[1:52:52] as hard as whether they have been in our
[1:52:53] universe can you ask can you read from
[1:52:55] us to
[1:53:07] what does it mean
[1:53:24] since you believe not before you believe
[1:53:27] after you believed
[1:53:30] after you believed did you receive the
[1:53:32] holy spirit
[1:53:33] is that not the question okay
[1:53:37] then here is a uh what they answer
[1:53:42] what does we go as they say
[1:53:51] so these people were even believers but
[1:53:53] they have never even
[1:53:54] heard of the holy spirit
[1:53:58] what are you talking about is there
[1:54:00] anything called the word sport is it
[1:54:01] even
[1:54:02] and these people are baptized by who by
[1:54:05] john the baptist
[1:54:07] so they were baptized but they did not
[1:54:09] know whether there is existence of the
[1:54:11] holy ghost why
[1:54:12] because johnny's baptism was the baptism
[1:54:15] of the painters
[1:54:17] telling them to believe in him who was
[1:54:19] going to come after
[1:54:20] him okay all right oh you're watching
[1:54:24] come on
[1:54:29] and so
[1:54:34] all right he said unto them i'll be okay
[1:54:36] go down go on down one down one down
[1:54:38] same time and he said unto them unto
[1:54:41] what they were about praise and they
[1:54:42] said unto
[1:54:44] john is baptism then paul said john
[1:54:46] verily baptized you with the baptism of
[1:54:48] repentance saying unto the people
[1:54:50] that they should believe on him we
[1:54:51] should come after him that is
[1:54:55] christ jesus so
[1:54:58] when they had this what happened
[1:55:01] they were
[1:55:05] so before we even talk about the holy
[1:55:08] spirit first of all can you believe the
[1:55:09] one
[1:55:10] of the day that's what i'm saying when
[1:55:13] you receive the message when you receive
[1:55:15] the word of the hour
[1:55:16] you are entitled to receive the holy
[1:55:20] ghost
[1:55:21] you are entitled to the token if you
[1:55:23] receive the word of the day the one of
[1:55:25] the year
[1:55:25] they are the believers but they have not
[1:55:27] received the message of the house
[1:55:29] because the message of the hour at that
[1:55:30] time was that jesus christ is coming the
[1:55:33] flesh
[1:55:34] you understand it's no longer the
[1:55:36] message of john that he will come but he
[1:55:38] has come
[1:55:39] so they had believed he will come but
[1:55:41] now they have to believe he had
[1:55:43] come and when they had this and they
[1:55:46] were
[1:55:47] baptized in the name of the
[1:55:50] lord jesus okay he have us
[1:55:57] my brother here and and
[1:56:00] when they were baptized okay you need to
[1:56:03] first
[1:56:04] open it okay yeah right there
[1:56:09] bus six
[1:56:27] he says they spoke in times and those
[1:56:30] words always go together
[1:56:31] oh he says they spoke in tongues and
[1:56:33] glorified god
[1:56:35] you cannot verify god unless you're
[1:56:36] going to glorify you in the language
[1:56:38] that you understand not so
[1:56:40] so prophecy but the venom says it's uh a
[1:56:43] time interpreted
[1:56:44] if times are spoken
[1:56:47] and and interpreted it becomes a process
[1:56:52] it becomes a prophecy so what it says
[1:56:54] and they speak with the tongues and
[1:56:56] prophesy it means they interpret their
[1:56:58] own times
[1:57:00] okay so these people they think they
[1:57:02] just speak tanks no
[1:57:05] the times have many and uh and paul are
[1:57:07] laid upon our eyes upon them so now they
[1:57:10] lay their hands upon them
[1:57:11] in order to receive their holy spirit
[1:57:14] that's what we do but please you will
[1:57:15] lay our hands upon you
[1:57:16] but the holy spirit you can receive it
[1:57:18] at any time as long as you believe
[1:57:20] that's why even these people they they
[1:57:22] are they not yet believe the message of
[1:57:24] the hour
[1:57:25] that's why they didn't know the holy
[1:57:27] ghost so when you believe the message of
[1:57:28] the hour
[1:57:29] then you are on the right channel to
[1:57:31] forgot to give you the holy spirit
[1:57:33] and the holy spirit does not come to you
[1:57:34] because you are believed the holy spirit
[1:57:36] comes to you
[1:57:40] i mean the holy spirit does not come to
[1:57:41] you on believing at believing
[1:57:43] but the holy spirit comes to you
[1:57:47] because you believe him you you want to
[1:57:49] receive him you desire him
[1:57:51] the holy spirit is jesus christ himself
[1:57:53] coming in your life taking over your
[1:57:55] life
[1:57:55] you seek him okay you must be aware it's
[1:57:59] not something that happens
[1:58:01] even if i said this by the way we don't
[1:58:04] know but i
[1:58:20] you must know where where and how
[1:58:24] you must know the day you see the holy
[1:58:26] spirit say that from that time
[1:58:29] that that must be the time when you
[1:58:30] wherever you guys say since that time
[1:58:32] i've never been a sex since that time
[1:58:34] something changed in my life
[1:58:36] since that time you understand when you
[1:58:38] have been touched like like jacob would
[1:58:40] say
[1:58:40] since that time something changed
[1:58:44] my name was no longer jacob i am now
[1:58:49] he's right meaning i am no longer a
[1:58:50] thief i am now
[1:58:52] a prince you understand so when you are
[1:58:55] you say the holy spirit changes okay now
[1:58:59] um i will show you one more password
[1:59:02] about it also on wednesday
[1:59:04] look it up there uh peter and john i
[1:59:07] think i read
[1:59:08] on wednesday they came
[1:59:11] to the disciples who were
[1:59:14] baptized already in the name of jesus
[1:59:16] christ these ones
[1:59:18] again because they will not perfect in
[1:59:19] the name of jesus christ
[1:59:21] and we found out if you are baptized but
[1:59:23] not
[1:59:24] by your own free will or not by your
[1:59:28] decision it means you are not a believer
[1:59:30] yet you have to first believe
[1:59:32] and you you hear the gospel and the
[1:59:35] belief
[1:59:37] okay let us look at acts chapter
[1:59:44] h
[1:59:56] 14.
[2:00:01] acts chapter 8 verse 14.
[2:00:08] can you guess that
[2:00:13] now when the apostles which were at
[2:00:14] jerusalem that samaria had received the
[2:00:17] word of god
[2:00:18] they sent out to them peter and john
[2:00:20] this one's i believe the word right
[2:00:23] they are doing the rest of them
[2:00:38] for them that they might receive the
[2:00:40] holy ghost for as yet
[2:00:42] he was fallen upon none of them only
[2:00:45] there we are
[2:00:49] you see so these ones are believed
[2:00:52] but they are not they have
[2:00:56] been baptized even in the name of the
[2:00:58] lord jesus christ
[2:01:00] they had believed they had never praised
[2:01:02] the name of jesus christ
[2:01:03] but they have not received the holy
[2:01:05] spirit read it again from verse 17
[2:01:08] read it again
[2:01:15] okay okay wait go back up verse 14
[2:01:19] [Music]
[2:01:21] okay let us read together one two three
[2:01:22] go now
[2:01:35] so wait do you have a southern versus
[2:01:37] 14.
[2:01:38] there are uh there are
[2:01:41] some people in samaria somebody is
[2:01:44] another city and usually it is another
[2:01:46] one right so the ones in samaria that
[2:01:49] jerusalem there people who have received
[2:01:51] the wife they have believed the message
[2:01:53] yeah but
[2:01:55] when they had that that these people had
[2:01:57] received the message they sent
[2:01:59] to them peter and john they said brother
[2:02:01] peter
[2:02:02] john one visit those believers and other
[2:02:05] believers of course
[2:02:05] believing also means baptism hey you
[2:02:08] cannot believe and you say i
[2:02:09] will not be baptized since then i
[2:02:11] believe which means they were already
[2:02:13] baptized okay
[2:02:17] so who when do i come down who peter and
[2:02:20] who
[2:02:21] john what continue
[2:02:27] so they never took them again in the
[2:02:28] water because they already been baptized
[2:02:31] in the name of our lord jesus christ if
[2:02:33] you are baptized in the name of all of
[2:02:34] jesus christ
[2:02:35] according i mean if you have believed
[2:02:38] and you are baptized in the name of our
[2:02:39] lord jesus christ
[2:02:41] then you don't need to be replaced again
[2:02:43] but if you baptize in the name of jesus
[2:02:45] christ before believing
[2:02:47] it's not even baptism you were washed
[2:02:49] let us say you swam
[2:02:50] you went to you were swimming and you
[2:02:52] were washed but nothing happened you
[2:02:54] understand
[2:02:55] so you need to really be baptized
[2:02:57] properly
[2:02:59] okay so baptism before believing is not
[2:03:01] baptism
[2:03:03] do you agree with that we saw that on
[2:03:05] wednesday so who
[2:03:06] whenever i come down pray for them why
[2:03:08] did they pray because these ones were
[2:03:10] already
[2:03:11] believers and they were already baptized
[2:03:14] that they might receive there
[2:03:17] for yet he was fallen upon none of them
[2:03:20] only only they were
[2:03:24] in the name of the lord so these people
[2:03:27] have oppressed even in the right name
[2:03:29] but the holy spirit has not come upon
[2:03:30] them so buddy baptism in the name of
[2:03:33] jesus christ does not give you the holy
[2:03:35] spirit
[2:03:36] what gives you the holy spirit is the
[2:03:38] condition of your heart
[2:03:40] whether you are ready to receive you god
[2:03:42] is more willing to give you the holy
[2:03:43] spirit than you are willing
[2:03:44] okay but if you are baptized in the name
[2:03:47] of our lord jesus christ and then you
[2:03:49] begin going to movies you begin going to
[2:03:51] watch these bad things going to the body
[2:03:52] games going to their body friends going
[2:03:53] to these things you know the people of
[2:03:55] the world and then you mix up with them
[2:03:56] and then you're like yeah yeah
[2:03:58] yeah man you do the things that do you
[2:04:00] you play the things that they play that
[2:04:01] you respect the way they talk
[2:04:03] you know you read the things they read
[2:04:04] you watch the things they watch you you
[2:04:06] are living
[2:04:07] in films how can you expect the word
[2:04:09] spirit to come in
[2:04:10] he will never come he will never show up
[2:04:13] well
[2:04:14] you have to make your house ready
[2:04:17] for him to come in you have to be ready
[2:04:20] for him to come in you have to wash your
[2:04:21] brothers do you remember when he was
[2:04:22] going to come down
[2:04:24] the other day in the old testament what
[2:04:26] did he tell moses to tell the children
[2:04:27] of israel
[2:04:28] because the children of israel were like
[2:04:29] ah we want god to speak to us directly
[2:04:32] you all the time here all the time are
[2:04:34] we not also people
[2:04:35] can't talk to us also directly tell him
[2:04:37] to come and talk to us directly why are
[2:04:39] you all the time
[2:04:40] god told them okay that's what they say
[2:04:42] not properly myself i will go to them
[2:04:44] but tell them before i go they should
[2:04:47] make
[2:04:48] themselves clean they should wash their
[2:04:51] clothes
[2:04:52] hey even glory so some of you don't
[2:04:55] shower
[2:04:57] he said let them be green let them wash
[2:04:59] their bodies let them wash their crust
[2:05:00] so if you are coming with the prince of
[2:05:02] god
[2:05:02] if you want the holy ghost to come down
[2:05:04] to you you must be clean both physically
[2:05:06] and spiritually
[2:05:08] so some of you if you do not want to
[2:05:09] decrease pleasure and physically how can
[2:05:11] the holy spirit come
[2:05:13] you have to make an atmosphere for the
[2:05:14] holy spirit to come it's quite an
[2:05:16] honorary spirit you remember when that
[2:05:17] guy was was a
[2:05:20] naked and they attacked it with the
[2:05:21] theater clothes this is unfortunate
[2:05:23] and he was where he was in the tombs why
[2:05:26] because
[2:05:27] he had another spirit in him and against
[2:05:30] spirit
[2:05:31] is the spirit of darkness of the devil
[2:05:33] which will take people in the tombs
[2:05:36] you know to live there like mad people
[2:05:38] you know they cannot shower they cannot
[2:05:40] you know wash their clothes they cannot
[2:05:43] brush their teeth they cannot you
[2:05:44] understand this is normal thing
[2:05:46] it's the spirit of any cleanliness it
[2:05:49] was on this man
[2:05:50] and and this man was in the drums and
[2:05:53] while he was in the trunks
[2:05:54] and this piece they saw jesus coming by
[2:05:57] the way even before he just arrived
[2:05:58] there they had already not known they
[2:06:00] never really know jesus is going there
[2:06:02] so the devil started to block jesus
[2:06:04] while he was in the sea they wanted to
[2:06:06] see
[2:06:06] the sheep you know so that's why
[2:06:09] god when he's going to visit you like
[2:06:11] the devil makes possible
[2:06:13] you don't go to the fellowship we don't
[2:06:15] even say you know you say i'm a resume
[2:06:18] and say you just lose me you know they
[2:06:20] never know when you got there yeah
[2:06:22] you will meet jesus and you'll be
[2:06:24] delivered you understand them so now
[2:06:26] you see that when jesus the devil first
[2:06:28] brought
[2:06:29] jesus overcomes the devil and he
[2:06:30] eventually arrives of course he came
[2:06:32] they said please be saved he's the one
[2:06:34] who created me
[2:06:35] the devil did not know that my my mind
[2:06:38] they don't know what they don't know
[2:06:39] that this god who created the cease
[2:06:42] he just had to say peace be still and
[2:06:44] when he already there you remember what
[2:06:45] happened
[2:06:47] this guy saw him not even this year but
[2:06:49] the demons in him
[2:06:50] and he clean his face
[2:07:05] just tell us to go in this one and some
[2:07:07] people said oh you see us i wouldn't eat
[2:07:08] pork because pork the demons
[2:07:11] it but i was like okay that's why you
[2:07:13] also should not eat fish because also
[2:07:15] when the the the the pigs when the
[2:07:18] animals had at the beach
[2:07:20] the pigs ran into the water and they
[2:07:22] died they died there
[2:07:23] so where did the demons go let's bring
[2:07:25] the leg so why why do you eat the fish
[2:07:28] okay maybe it's a fish outside i don't
[2:07:30] eat why do you drink the water
[2:07:31] please can you stop drinking water
[2:07:33] because there's still sweating in the
[2:07:34] demons
[2:07:35] please in any disturbance you are
[2:07:37] allowed to eat anything as long as you
[2:07:38] pray for it
[2:07:40] that's right you're looking at me as if
[2:07:42] you don't eat breakfast
[2:07:46] you can eat anything you can eat
[2:07:49] anything the bible says so
[2:07:50] and as long as you have what pray for me
[2:07:53] i'm covering many points here but i'm
[2:07:55] coming
[2:07:55] up to a conclusion so then this jesus
[2:07:58] christ
[2:07:59] uh when he comes to jesus now that
[2:08:00] demonic lives and the money became glee
[2:08:03] so here is my point when you come to the
[2:08:05] lord friends
[2:08:06] when you come to jesus christ you must
[2:08:09] be clean
[2:08:10] you must prepare atmosphere for him to
[2:08:12] come and
[2:08:14] this man when jesus first came he made
[2:08:16] him clean he gave him another cloth
[2:08:18] he dressed to him and he told him what
[2:08:19] to go and clean up
[2:08:31] so listen now when you talk about uh
[2:08:34] the the other people the ones that were
[2:08:37] in the old testament
[2:08:38] they waited they killed themselves they
[2:08:41] did not decrease
[2:08:42] the atmosphere anybody came down because
[2:08:44] they are hard to wear not right
[2:08:45] too even if you clean yourself outside
[2:08:48] but when your heart is very content
[2:08:50] you know when your evil when your
[2:08:52] imaginations are evil continuously
[2:08:54] before god
[2:08:55] he will not show up still he will not
[2:08:56] feel you you understand these are
[2:08:58] conditions of preparing yourself for him
[2:09:00] to feel
[2:09:01] so eventually then when he came down
[2:09:05] he had not even calmed down this by the
[2:09:07] way it was just the thunders that were
[2:09:08] coming before him you know
[2:09:11] hey hey please kindly kindly
[2:09:15] be a good brother be a good pastor go
[2:09:17] and deal with you
[2:09:18] for us we shall hear from you they even
[2:09:20] told him we don't want to go to speak to
[2:09:22] us
[2:09:22] anymore you understand because their
[2:09:25] hearts their minds were not
[2:09:27] right they were not
[2:09:30] they will not you know deal with it so
[2:09:33] not everybody will deal with the word of
[2:09:34] us
[2:09:34] if you want the holy ghost make an
[2:09:36] atmosphere for him to come and he will
[2:09:38] always come
[2:09:39] he will always come never allow anyone
[2:09:41] to deceive to you that when you receive
[2:09:42] the message you have received the holy
[2:09:43] ghost no
[2:09:44] the holy spirit is the holy ghost but
[2:09:46] the holy ghost also is the message
[2:09:47] you understand so when you receive the
[2:09:50] message you are
[2:09:51] built the first condition the first way
[2:09:53] for him to come
[2:09:54] now prepare yourself the condition
[2:09:57] around you everything around you what
[2:09:58] you do what you say
[2:09:59] what you think what even for himself i
[2:10:02] mean uh
[2:10:04] even paul actually said that we should
[2:10:05] watch our conversations
[2:10:07] also wonders and many other things the
[2:10:09] things we do okay
[2:10:11] so friends you can receive the holocaust
[2:10:13] even before
[2:10:15] baptism you know
[2:10:18] you listen to that what is this you'll
[2:10:20] be blessed you can receive the holy
[2:10:22] ghost as long as your heart is being
[2:10:23] picked and of course anyone will receive
[2:10:26] the word cannot reject baptism
[2:10:28] in the name of our lord jesus christ if
[2:10:30] they reject it is a clear sign that you
[2:10:32] are not free
[2:10:36] amen yes and even you can be baptized
[2:10:39] in water and not receive the holy ghost
[2:10:43] if you had a lot of light until it is
[2:10:45] right and
[2:10:46] if it is right then he will come how can
[2:10:48] he come in a place
[2:10:50] let me give you the story brother before
[2:10:51] you say this man
[2:10:54] uh was told by his mama please go go
[2:10:56] where go with jesus
[2:10:58] he said mama i go with jesus
[2:11:01] let jesus be in the trunk meaning in a
[2:11:04] boot
[2:11:05] and he had he had a crate of eggs there
[2:11:08] do you know what happened
[2:11:09] the guy had an accident he died
[2:11:10] everybody was in the car diet
[2:11:12] but the car trunks the main intake the
[2:11:16] eggs the main intake not even one egg
[2:11:18] broke
[2:11:20] and that solar product is a true story
[2:11:23] what does it mean where you put jesus
[2:11:25] where you would be
[2:11:27] so if you get healed in the church you
[2:11:29] will be here when you come here you will
[2:11:30] feel it but when you go
[2:11:32] he's not there you won't be there but if
[2:11:34] you put him in your life
[2:11:35] every any of your life you will be there
[2:11:36] you'll be welcome you understand
[2:11:38] why you will come here he comes if you
[2:11:40] will come him in your hand
[2:11:41] he will he comes we had a very wonderful
[2:11:44] session here prayer
[2:11:45] god beat a lot of things here and i tell
[2:11:46] you what if you you create an atmosphere
[2:11:49] for the holy spirit to come
[2:11:50] he will always come that's what i do he
[2:11:52] will always come
[2:11:54] and praise the lord yes you want to say
[2:11:56] something
[2:12:04] um
[2:12:18] um
[2:12:32] yes
[2:13:02] brother of joseph that set his soul on
[2:13:04] fire and when our
[2:13:06] joseph and when our children even jesus
[2:13:10] will come to the people who have kept
[2:13:13] the commandments of god
[2:13:14] and who have gone back to palestine he
[2:13:17] is so released for fire little basically
[2:13:20] finds that 144 000
[2:13:23] israelites from all over the earth who
[2:13:26] have gone back to palestine for their
[2:13:28] redemption they will be standing there
[2:13:31] and
[2:13:31] receive him whom to know
[2:13:35] his life
[2:13:40] yes i wanted to know what
[2:13:45] romanian yeah because they say that
[2:13:48] that style it should be as in the end
[2:13:51] time
[2:13:53] the other time of joseph it is
[2:13:56] okay that's time that's how the time
[2:13:59] will be
[2:14:04] okay so now um if you want to get to
[2:14:07] know
[2:14:07] the full
[2:14:11] this is a big subject and i've
[2:14:13] appreciated it
[2:14:14] before uh you know have you ever gone to
[2:14:17] on this channel the message site youtube
[2:14:22] and search for the someone second
[2:14:24] someone reminds me that
[2:14:26] i do
[2:14:29] some of you were here when these things
[2:14:30] were being pushed
[2:14:34] were you not
[2:14:39] yeah we have not come here
[2:14:44] okay there is someone's that i pushed
[2:14:47] on on there and uh
[2:14:51] you you just type in in youtube the
[2:14:53] message site without leaving spaces to
[2:14:55] come
[2:14:56] i preach on the the depth of
[2:15:00] prophecy the depth of prophecy
[2:15:04] in there there is a place
[2:15:07] where i speak on
[2:15:13] the making that right now the paramount
[2:15:15] decision
[2:15:16] now
[2:15:33] uh in here we need to speak about
[2:15:37] the the the 144000 jews i think
[2:15:40] i've spoken about it here
[2:15:48] the reason
[2:16:00] but uh to answer your question in a very
[2:16:03] brief way
[2:16:05] the 100 for what god deals with the jews
[2:16:07] and the gentiles at this
[2:16:08] are at different times so the jews
[2:16:12] are the ones that are
[2:16:15] dealt with also but in a group way
[2:16:19] god is with them as a nation but with us
[2:16:21] gentiles they're using us as individuals
[2:16:24] so with the jews we even know the number
[2:16:28] from a manga that's going to be saved
[2:16:31] excuse me
[2:16:33] like you see from among the gentiles we
[2:16:35] have two major groups
[2:16:38] where you can set three major groups we
[2:16:39] have the first group is the believers
[2:16:41] the ones who are going to win the
[2:16:42] rapture the bride
[2:16:43] then you have the the right is the
[2:16:46] iraqis okay
[2:16:47] then you have another group which is the
[2:16:49] fruits virgins then
[2:16:50] the ones who are christians they want to
[2:16:52] work christians but they will not be the
[2:16:54] enemy so they will remain okay they're
[2:16:56] going through the tribulation right
[2:16:58] now then you have the unbelievers so
[2:17:00] even among
[2:17:01] the jews is the same thing it's the same
[2:17:03] thing
[2:17:04] so you you have the same groups but then
[2:17:06] the 144 thousand
[2:17:09] is the elect of the jewish
[2:17:13] rest for them they get this same message
[2:17:17] that you preach
[2:17:18] this is a message but through their own
[2:17:20] message
[2:17:22] that's why we talk about the five
[2:17:23] comings of the right the fifth
[2:17:25] one will go to them and they will preach
[2:17:28] to them the same message
[2:17:30] because how do we notice the same
[2:17:31] message these people they receive the
[2:17:33] testimony of christ
[2:17:36] so they believe jesus has their savior
[2:17:38] so they have baptized in jesus name
[2:17:39] so they steal the holy ghost
[2:17:44] and they received by the time they
[2:17:46] received their message it will be during
[2:17:48] the time
[2:17:48] when the world is uh
[2:17:52] is a tribulation the great tribulation
[2:17:56] at the time that they will receive the
[2:17:58] message the bride will be
[2:18:00] at the marriage supper of the round
[2:18:01] during it's gonna be a space of three
[2:18:03] and a half years
[2:18:05] we are in heaven with the bright group
[2:18:09] the first vision is the tribulation and
[2:18:12] the jewish the jews the 144th
[2:18:14] are receiving their message through
[2:18:16] moses and in egypt
[2:18:18] so those ones are the ones that he's
[2:18:19] talking about there the 100
[2:18:22] and the father
[2:18:25] you remember that that was a story of uh
[2:18:27] of joseph
[2:18:29] and the story of joseph is the type of
[2:18:31] the story the end of the story the type
[2:18:33] of jesus
[2:18:34] you know everything about joseph
[2:18:36] happened with jesus can we start
[2:18:39] what happened to jesus number one
[2:18:44] but before he's being hated
[2:18:48] he was loved by his father for some god
[2:18:51] love the one that he gave his own
[2:18:52] all his only begotten son god loved you
[2:18:55] right
[2:18:55] uh-huh go ahead number one number two
[2:18:59] he was headed by his brethren the jews
[2:19:01] themselves they were his brother
[2:19:03] they hated him with the accent they told
[2:19:05] the
[2:19:06] what was the name of this guy he said
[2:19:08] crucify him
[2:19:09] crucify himself can i let barabbas go oh
[2:19:12] jesus
[2:19:15] they gave him up they never loved him
[2:19:18] they hated him
[2:19:20] what happened to jesus
[2:19:24] he was sold he was
[2:19:27] beaten
[2:19:31] they beat jesus and then they
[2:19:34] threw him out of the jewish whatever
[2:19:36] they sold him to the jedi through the
[2:19:38] the gentiles the romans is there king of
[2:19:41] jesus not
[2:19:44] not the jews the jews with the romans
[2:19:45] they understand so
[2:20:09] the same price which judas betrayed you
[2:20:13] with that's a
[2:20:23] all right like jesus christ came among
[2:20:26] kings and among the genders right
[2:20:28] he meant
[2:20:42] was restored another one was cute just
[2:20:44] like when jesus was on the cross
[2:20:46] one prisoner
[2:20:50] another one huh
[2:20:59] so he was lifted because of his gift
[2:21:02] because of his wisdom because of his
[2:21:05] knowledge he was uplifted
[2:21:06] above everyone else he became a priest
[2:21:09] among
[2:21:10] the egyptians jesus became a priest
[2:21:12] among the gentiles
[2:21:15] yes so jesus to us has become
[2:21:19] god he's become a priest
[2:21:22] he's become actually not even second
[2:21:24] this guy had
[2:21:26] he joseph was was the only hope that he
[2:21:30] did
[2:21:31] did you know that jesus is the only hope
[2:21:33] that we have
[2:21:35] there's not many nothing else but jesus
[2:21:40] and then eventually he was he
[2:21:43] he became a prince blah blah blah then
[2:21:45] now what's the next point
[2:21:48] he married the gentile god like jesus
[2:21:51] will marry a gentile
[2:22:15] so now the jews must return back to the
[2:22:18] same god they rejected
[2:22:20] because of anger because of you know
[2:22:22] they will realize that
[2:22:23] they need food but without knowing that
[2:22:25] they have turned to the one that
[2:22:26] rejected
[2:22:27] when they realize it is him what does
[2:22:29] joseph say
[2:22:31] i will not say i will give you food but
[2:22:33] i will not give you all that you need i
[2:22:36] will keep one of your brothers
[2:22:37] i want you first to go and bring
[2:22:40] the bring my what my little brother
[2:22:43] named
[2:22:45] until his little brother benjamin came
[2:22:48] he never revealed
[2:22:50] himself to them as joseph but when they
[2:22:53] came
[2:22:54] and his father came and everybody came
[2:22:56] then he unveiled himself
[2:22:58] and told him i am jesus
[2:23:01] you understand so the jews the other 45
[2:23:03] other jews
[2:23:05] they they usually remember they have
[2:23:07] already turned to them to their homeland
[2:23:10] they are already homeless but why is god
[2:23:13] not returning to them
[2:23:14] why is jesus not revealing himself to
[2:23:16] them
[2:23:18] because he's waiting for the elect he's
[2:23:20] waiting for them his friends
[2:23:22] he's waiting for his brother he's
[2:23:24] waiting
[2:23:25] for the little benjamin to come back
[2:23:27] again there are those jews that have not
[2:23:29] yet returned
[2:23:30] to israel until today
[2:23:33] there are those elites that have not yet
[2:23:36] maybe born or something
[2:23:37] but they must be in israel they must be
[2:23:40] trying to do that
[2:23:41] the very last of them when they go back
[2:23:43] to israel
[2:23:45] meanwhile also when the jew the agenda
[2:23:47] is their cup of belief which is becoming
[2:23:49] full
[2:23:50] so together christ is not coming because
[2:23:52] the last one has not come
[2:23:54] from our side but also question not
[2:23:57] going to them because the last one there
[2:23:59] has got to come when the last
[2:24:03] comes in they also the jews will gather
[2:24:05] back in jerusalem
[2:24:06] in israel then they will receive their
[2:24:08] message through mozart
[2:24:10] which means the rapture will happen also
[2:24:12] so what
[2:24:13] happens here also happens concurrently
[2:24:15] with what is happening to israel
[2:24:19] it is very important to look at israel
[2:24:21] israel is going to stay peace
[2:24:23] whatever happens to israel
[2:24:26] is it is it's shaping the world event
[2:24:31] it is shaping it israel is not a nation
[2:24:34] like any other
[2:24:34] israel is in god's hands that's why
[2:24:37] anybody who is
[2:24:38] casting israel even today is under a
[2:24:40] cast anybody who is against israel
[2:24:43] they will be contending with god even
[2:24:46] when god has cast away
[2:24:48] the israelites by half blindness but the
[2:24:50] bible says has god cast them away
[2:24:52] completely no
[2:24:53] don't deceive yourself god has not cast
[2:24:55] away his people wishing for
[2:24:56] you so in other words god still loves
[2:24:59] israel
[2:24:59] versus defends israel god still is with
[2:25:02] israel even today in current day israel
[2:25:04] god has done many phenomenas things that
[2:25:07] the world will not ever do
[2:25:08] so you see that they are in scripture
[2:25:12] they shape the world events
[2:25:13] wild events and now when they they
[2:25:16] receive when they
[2:25:18] all of them are back to their homeland
[2:25:19] and they also believe when they've
[2:25:21] got all their hands then indeed
[2:25:24] they will also view the template many
[2:25:25] things will happen but also we know that
[2:25:27] now they will receive their message
[2:25:29] by the time they are receiving their
[2:25:30] message who are the ones receiving their
[2:25:32] message
[2:25:34] those ones who would believe the message
[2:25:36] of this day
[2:25:38] not from the bottom but from there
[2:25:40] elijah
[2:25:41] and when they receive this message when
[2:25:44] they receive this message
[2:25:45] i mean those who receive this message
[2:25:47] will be the
[2:25:48] legal danger
[2:25:53] and uh it's not like it is there's going
[2:25:56] to be one tribe of benjamin
[2:25:57] it's from all the tribes the elect from
[2:26:00] every
[2:26:01] tribe of israel can you imagine god even
[2:26:03] knows them
[2:26:04] one of them
[2:26:09] [Music]
[2:26:17] we may be one here i don't know
[2:26:37] [Laughter]
[2:26:46] strength
[2:26:51] let me tell you the way of the cross is
[2:26:53] narrow
[2:26:55] it is narrow it is narrow
[2:26:59] it is narrow
[2:27:02] now it's not white it is now
[2:27:05] and you have to press yourself in it you
[2:27:08] have to press yourself you have to fight
[2:27:09] it out until you overcome each of us is
[2:27:12] fighting but
[2:27:12] are you fighting to overcome all right
[2:27:15] then
[2:27:16] then we will receive the rapture they
[2:27:18] will receive
[2:27:19] the messiah brother they answer your
[2:27:21] question yes
[2:27:26] yes isaac you wanted to speak all along
[2:27:28] um
[2:28:01] we are ready for it everything is in
[2:28:04] order
[2:28:05] as the jews broke the message even so
[2:28:09] the gentiles
[2:28:10] take
[2:28:16] [Music]
[2:28:24] yes
[2:28:26] are they going to be gentiles that's for
[2:28:27] what he said
[2:28:30] but that does not necessarily mean that
[2:28:31] elijah and mothers are going to be
[2:28:33] gentiles because we have had
[2:28:37] many people bring the gospel to us not
[2:28:40] only for thee
[2:28:41] with the only problem to us no
[2:28:45] the others also brought the message at
[2:28:47] that time but
[2:28:48] in every generation there has been a
[2:28:49] major message and that messenger is god
[2:28:52] who chooses uh
[2:28:54] but also it does not mean because mozart
[2:28:56] the one who's going to preach to them it
[2:28:57] does not mean that
[2:28:58] strictly them alone no one else will get
[2:29:01] their message
[2:29:02] even now i speak to you i have a friend
[2:29:04] of mine a brother from the u.s
[2:29:08] he's the other church he's a he's a he
[2:29:10] might have given a jewish sister
[2:29:12] and she's also believed this message and
[2:29:15] they
[2:29:15] they they have a church
[2:29:18] in i don't know the name of it but i was
[2:29:21] asking him the other day
[2:29:22] oh how did they contact you i don't want
[2:29:24] to remember i was asking the other day
[2:29:26] uh how it is and he told me he even sent
[2:29:29] me a report he was telling me to there
[2:29:31] well
[2:29:31] during the last war that they had
[2:29:34] so he told me everything is well with
[2:29:36] them but they are pushing this message
[2:29:37] there
[2:29:38] also i was trying to give you something
[2:29:40] back but
[2:29:41] those brothers are going there in the
[2:29:43] name of this world
[2:29:44] okay that they even as they use abroad
[2:29:47] the generals will take
[2:29:48] but i always say we got adversaries but
[2:29:51] i sent them there god bless you
[2:29:54] yeah god sends god blessings so yes
[2:29:58] the gentiles will take the message there
[2:30:01] and like the jews brought them
[2:30:16] he spoke to his brother in another town
[2:30:19] did you know that
[2:30:20] the first day and age which is the head
[2:30:23] of the
[2:30:24] the head of god went out to the message
[2:30:28] [Music]
[2:30:30] his age
[2:30:42] yes that's it says what it means it
[2:30:46] means what it says
[2:30:48] do you see times everywhere
[2:30:51] but you see uh it happened as it
[2:30:54] happened yesterday they wrote on on our
[2:30:56] uh you know god has always been
[2:31:00] used in times even joseph spoke to them
[2:31:03] in times
[2:31:04] so these times many of them are not
[2:31:07] wrong
[2:31:08] others are correct by them not all times
[2:31:11] are wrong
[2:31:11] i was watching one of the questions the
[2:31:13] other day the oneness met apostles and
[2:31:15] then
[2:31:16] two people three different people gave
[2:31:17] times with another one
[2:31:19] preaching in the church and it was just
[2:31:21] matters
[2:31:22] so it happens it happens even the
[2:31:25] message churches even in our churches
[2:31:27] god still uses those times the abundance
[2:31:31] of time
[2:31:31] is another clear sign that our age is
[2:31:34] finishing
[2:31:34] and indeed you people who have been
[2:31:36] playing around i tell you
[2:31:38] we don't have much time we don't know
[2:31:41] when the rapture is coming
[2:31:43] but but the banana told us to continue
[2:31:45] our potatoes
[2:31:48] but also we should leave as if it comes
[2:31:50] the next minute
[2:31:52] should be ready that is coming anytime
[2:31:55] but we should continue doing
[2:31:56] what is that we have been doing to for
[2:31:59] our life
[2:32:01] does that answer your question and then
[2:32:04] also in phase 39
[2:32:08] okay
[2:32:35] [Music]
[2:32:42] so he said that he crossed he gave the
[2:32:44] blessings of the elder to the younger
[2:32:46] and the blessings of the younger to the
[2:32:47] elderly
[2:32:49] because they've prayed not so far
[2:33:10] yes i mean the blessings come through
[2:33:12] because
[2:33:14] like the blessings are coming across yes
[2:33:17] ah i love that that psyche you touched a
[2:33:20] very good area
[2:33:21] i kind of preached a very wonderful
[2:33:23] someone here you see
[2:33:25] jack will be like this the blessing of
[2:33:28] the younger went to the eola the
[2:33:30] blessing of the yeah
[2:33:30] or everybody went to the younger meaning
[2:33:32] that the jews
[2:33:35] they were they weren't supposed to
[2:33:36] receive the messiah right
[2:33:38] but incidentally and
[2:33:41] god is still god is
[2:33:46] over the foreign to ask the gentiles the
[2:33:50] gender does not come to christ but by
[2:33:51] the way all
[2:33:55] the cross of calvary so it is by the
[2:33:57] cross
[2:33:58] that we are able to receive christ so
[2:34:01] the gender is right like you read romans
[2:34:03] 11 that's why i was telling you romans
[2:34:04] 11.
[2:34:05] romans 11 he tells us that they they
[2:34:08] jews they are blinded can you take it
[2:34:09] down there
[2:34:10] wait talks about the blinding of the
[2:34:11] jews they are blinded so that
[2:34:14] um oh but i don't have that scripture
[2:34:19] here
[2:34:22] go down where is that
[2:34:28] is not obtained that which is secret for
[2:34:30] but the election
[2:34:32] has obtained it and the rest we are
[2:34:34] blinded over there on down
[2:34:35] down according as it is written god has
[2:34:39] given them
[2:34:40] the spirit of slammer eyes that they
[2:34:42] should not see here they should not
[2:34:44] hear after this until today they don't
[2:34:46] believe jesus
[2:34:48] they don't believe him as a savior they
[2:34:50] believe him like they're muslims
[2:34:52] and then he says let their table be made
[2:34:54] okay go down go down
[2:34:57] let their eyes be darker that they may
[2:34:58] not see and burn down their back always
[2:35:00] ah
[2:35:01] i said they are very somber that they
[2:35:03] should fall wait for peace but rather
[2:35:05] through
[2:35:05] therefore salvation is coming unto the
[2:35:08] gentiles for to provoke them to
[2:35:10] jealousy go down down down down now if
[2:35:13] the folding of them be the richest of
[2:35:14] the world and the diminishing of the
[2:35:16] jews be the richest of the gentiles how
[2:35:18] much more their fullness
[2:35:20] but i speak to you gentiles and as much
[2:35:22] as i am the apostles i magnify my office
[2:35:26] if by any means i may provoke to
[2:35:27] impression them which among my flesh
[2:35:30] i may save some of them for if they're
[2:35:32] casting away of them be the reconciling
[2:35:34] of the world
[2:35:35] what shall the receiving of them be but
[2:35:37] life of the day
[2:35:38] for if the first fruit be all in the lab
[2:35:40] all is also holding if the root be
[2:35:42] already saw the branches the root is
[2:35:44] priced on the branches we have
[2:35:45] where israel but they were cut off and
[2:35:47] we were grafted
[2:35:48] in the details yeah and if some of the
[2:35:51] branches be broken off and now being a
[2:35:53] wildly olive tree what grafted inner
[2:35:55] manga then and we then protect us to the
[2:35:57] root and the fatness
[2:35:58] of the olive tree boast not against the
[2:36:01] branches but if thou boast
[2:36:03] thou bear is not the fruit by the fruit
[2:36:05] but the root deep
[2:36:06] the root okay okay okay
[2:36:09] okay so they were cut off they were
[2:36:11] broken off but we might be
[2:36:13] grafted you know grafted yes yeah we
[2:36:16] have been grafted
[2:36:17] into the olive tree which is jesus
[2:36:19] christ we are the wildly tree
[2:36:21] we are the branch from the 103.
[2:36:25] you see those you you sometimes hear
[2:36:27] those worldly feelings that
[2:36:28] are in your heart and in your flesh that
[2:36:32] are detecting the world
[2:36:33] the why because you have been from a
[2:36:35] while literally
[2:36:36] you know so you have to reject and fight
[2:36:39] it out
[2:36:40] that you will accept to be grafted in
[2:36:42] order
[2:36:43] so that you can grow and mix together
[2:36:45] with christ and let his life
[2:36:47] give you life
[2:37:00] so is there any question in chapter one
[2:37:04] okay how many i'm gonna finish chapter
[2:37:05] one again
[2:37:09] one two three four five
[2:37:14] this is
[2:37:19] i'm going to request that all of
[2:37:22] all those that have not finished chapter
[2:37:24] one you give me a promise that you're
[2:37:26] going to finish it tonight
[2:37:28] before you see i'm gonna give you that
[2:37:32] promise
[2:37:34] okay okay
[2:37:38] uh-huh i'm gonna have given the promise
[2:37:40] you gotta say don't be a fool
[2:37:42] you better not promise that you don't
[2:37:44] fulfill you
[2:37:45] so this night you have already given the
[2:37:48] promise before this is the people and
[2:37:49] before god
[2:37:50] finish that chapter then when we meet
[2:37:53] again
[2:37:55] please don't don't procrastinate don't
[2:37:57] push it
[2:38:06] you know someone who died just now was
[2:38:09] thinking was having plans for tomorrow
[2:38:11] morning
[2:38:12] so read it now if the rule was checked
[2:38:14] it would take you after you have
[2:38:15] finished it
[2:38:20] yes yes what's the question
[2:38:24] what was the question
[2:38:28] [Music]
[2:38:41] [Music]
[2:38:51] okay that's a good good question number
[2:38:53] one you you ask that uh the people who
[2:38:55] are going to believe
[2:38:56] it's like some people are like okay now
[2:38:58] unless you receive the message of the
[2:38:59] day
[2:39:00] you don't receive the holy ghost no the
[2:39:03] like you said the message of the day yes
[2:39:05] the message of that day
[2:39:07] but there are people also who
[2:39:10] uh receive the holy ghost by the message
[2:39:13] of their time
[2:39:15] the message of their time god is
[2:39:17] provided way
[2:39:18] for every generation is the message of
[2:39:20] their time they must be the hour
[2:39:22] we of the hour because the hours keep
[2:39:24] changing
[2:39:26] that was the hour of ludha i mean
[2:39:29] iranians the hour of
[2:39:30] martin the hour of rutherford you
[2:39:33] understand
[2:39:34] now we are in the our house our
[2:39:38] time we have received the message so now
[2:39:40] the people i think are answered
[2:39:42] concerning our generation the people who
[2:39:45] come in this generation
[2:39:46] some of them they will not be accounted
[2:39:51] this generation others for example
[2:39:55] uh these people in acts chapter 19
[2:39:59] they were from the generation before the
[2:40:02] generation of john the baptist
[2:40:05] they are the heart of the message but
[2:40:09] the message of john and that's why they
[2:40:12] didn't know about what baptism in the
[2:40:13] name of our lord jesus christ even the
[2:40:15] holy spirit
[2:40:16] so if they had died would they have gone
[2:40:19] to heaven
[2:40:22] yes because they were believers
[2:40:25] that's all they knew i always tell
[2:40:27] people this message
[2:40:28] is the best
[2:40:32] i'm afraid i'm feeling words are failing
[2:40:34] but what i can say it is the only truth
[2:40:36] that i know in this generation
[2:40:38] if you find another that is higher than
[2:40:40] we should give it to me or believe it
[2:40:44] but until then i am sticking with this
[2:40:47] message because
[2:40:48] it's the only truth that i talk about is
[2:40:50] that the way this
[2:40:53] the message checks them talk about the
[2:40:55] moments they must suggest
[2:40:57] talk about the the the catholics the
[2:40:59] message talk about the angry
[2:41:00] messages
[2:41:04] all those groups why because
[2:41:08] all those groups are not really
[2:41:12] higher than the message of this day they
[2:41:14] are lower than revelation
[2:41:18] so but if believers come to another
[2:41:20] generation
[2:41:22] some of them like those people they have
[2:41:25] to
[2:41:26] receive the message
[2:41:30] understand like those people have to be
[2:41:32] baptized again
[2:41:33] in the name of our lord jesus christ and
[2:41:35] be filled with the holy spirit you
[2:41:36] understand
[2:41:38] but are you still with me yes but we
[2:41:41] find out
[2:41:41] that these people
[2:41:44] uh if they had died they would go but
[2:41:47] now that they are
[2:41:48] hard and they do not reject
[2:41:51] they go also okay but if they are
[2:41:54] rejected
[2:41:55] would they go as safe as that
[2:41:59] so the simple answer to that anybody
[2:42:02] because there are some people that cared
[2:42:03] about that
[2:42:03] brother and said but we are trying to
[2:42:05] get our parents
[2:42:07] about this message they can't see but
[2:42:10] there was
[2:42:11] yeah genuine christians from the other
[2:42:14] reformations the other movements before
[2:42:16] but i'm talking about one that your
[2:42:19] father will come for will come
[2:42:21] will be counted from among the saves of
[2:42:23] the other generation
[2:42:25] so who knows who will become the other
[2:42:28] generations
[2:42:30] okay so don't say i i'm going to preach
[2:42:32] to that one but you're going to account
[2:42:33] for them on the other generation
[2:42:36] don't start doing that okay god knows
[2:42:39] your work is telling people about this
[2:42:40] the message of this day of this house if
[2:42:43] what i'm saying ah this one's like
[2:42:45] god will come them on during this
[2:42:47] generation you have to tell them
[2:42:49] and they believe okay so
[2:42:52] if you receive the message of your day
[2:42:54] you are entitled to receive
[2:42:56] the holy spirit your question
[2:43:00] yes remind me the holy spirit
[2:43:04] yes if someone gets it
[2:43:10] the moment you receive the holy spirit
[2:43:13] you are sealed until you win
[2:43:15] until the moment you get to the right
[2:43:18] next to the body
[2:43:19] what about it and here you are until you
[2:43:22] sin
[2:43:23] and then you assume that you win
[2:43:26] until well the bible says until when
[2:43:30] until the rapture
[2:43:33] you see the reason why you keep
[2:43:35] answering and then with the doings
[2:43:36] because you're not sure what you're
[2:43:37] saying
[2:43:38] the bible says you are saved until the
[2:43:39] day of your redemption
[2:43:42] and what is your redemption are you
[2:43:44] redeemed now
[2:43:46] are you ready now yes of course you are
[2:43:49] a day
[2:43:50] i am redeemed but you're in a price you
[2:43:53] understand
[2:43:54] yes of course you're redeemed but you
[2:43:55] are yet to be redeemed
[2:43:57] you understand like jesus is here
[2:44:01] you see now
[2:44:08] yes you understand so jesus came
[2:44:11] right he is here and he is
[2:44:16] coming the same yesterday today and
[2:44:20] forever so in the same way
[2:44:23] i have the holy ghost now i am redeemed
[2:44:26] now
[2:44:26] i was redeemed before the fathers of the
[2:44:28] world and i will be redeemed by a good
[2:44:30] option
[2:44:31] you understand so it's a season
[2:44:34] different seasons of the same redemption
[2:44:36] so you are redeemed once so you can also
[2:44:39] set before the foundation of the world
[2:44:41] so the question is when does the holy
[2:44:44] spirit leave
[2:44:44] the holy spirit is always there it's the
[2:44:46] amnesty the moment you receive him
[2:44:49] it is the is the endless of the price
[2:44:51] which you're gonna keep beginning once
[2:44:53] is it your full redemption full
[2:44:55] redemption
[2:44:56] and you receive that when you go the
[2:44:58] rapture all right
[2:44:59] then you will see the fullness of it
[2:45:01] christ himself
[2:45:03] but for now when you receive the holy
[2:45:05] spirit you are saved
[2:45:07] and the bible says now to him that has
[2:45:09] the holy spirit that is
[2:45:14] you cannot even see if you are god of
[2:45:17] god
[2:45:19] because why
[2:45:20] [Music]
[2:45:22] because he said oh god
[2:45:39] you understand so to a child of god
[2:45:43] [Music]
[2:45:45] you cannot see what is sin
[2:45:52] sin is unbelief the bible never said
[2:45:55] you'll not do mistakes
[2:45:57] you're not really because remember that
[2:45:59] you are living in the flesh in this
[2:46:01] house of clay
[2:46:02] it's gonna break it's gonna do things
[2:46:04] it's gonna you understand
[2:46:05] but whenever you go straight you will
[2:46:07] run back
[2:46:08] [Music]
[2:46:10] why because the blood is there to cover
[2:46:13] and wash but you're not gonna say
[2:46:15] oh praise god let me do whatever i wanna
[2:46:17] do the blood is the clear sign that you
[2:46:21] don't even have
[2:46:22] the blood covering disease okay because
[2:46:25] when you receive your other blood is
[2:46:27] there
[2:46:27] you are always going to be in fear
[2:46:30] god's grace has told my heart
[2:46:35] to fear
[2:46:38] [Music]
[2:46:50] uh
[2:46:53] [Music]
[2:46:58] amazing grace
[2:47:07] [Music]
[2:47:18] oh
[2:47:32] is
[2:47:46] is
[2:48:00] is
[2:48:04] [Music]
[2:48:14] oh
[2:48:17] [Music]
[2:48:21] [Applause]
[2:48:22] one more time
[2:48:38] [Music]
[2:48:45] [Music]
