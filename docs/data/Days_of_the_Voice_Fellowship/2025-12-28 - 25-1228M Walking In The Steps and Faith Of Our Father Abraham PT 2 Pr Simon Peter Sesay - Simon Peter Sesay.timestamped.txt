[1:23:45] of praise this morning for your spirit
[1:23:48] is here. His presence is here with us.
[1:23:52] Amen.
[1:24:00] We
[1:24:03] met our way.
[1:24:09] You
[1:24:12] made our way.
[1:24:19] when I bounce against the wall
[1:24:24] and it looked as if it was over.
[1:24:30] You
[1:24:33] made our way.
[1:24:40] And we're standing
[1:24:42] here
[1:24:45] only because
[1:24:47] you made
[1:24:50] a way.
[1:24:53] You made a way.
[1:24:56] You
[1:24:58] who made
[1:25:01] our way.
[1:25:03] Oh, you me away.
[1:25:06] You
[1:25:09] made our way.
[1:25:16] in our B against the wall
[1:25:21] and it lo
[1:25:26] you
[1:25:31] made a way
[1:25:39] only
[1:25:41] because
[1:25:43] you
[1:25:45] Sing it again as our pastor comes.
[1:25:49] Oh, you
[1:25:52] made our way.
[1:25:57] You made a way.
[1:26:00] You
[1:26:02] made a way
[1:26:09] when against the wall
[1:26:14] and it looked as if it was over.
[1:26:20] You
[1:26:22] made our way
[1:26:29] and we're standing
[1:26:32] here
[1:26:34] only because
[1:26:37] you made
[1:26:40] a way. I wonder if we can sing those
[1:26:43] words from our hearts knowing that the
[1:26:46] Lord has really made a way for us to be
[1:26:48] here this morning. He purpose that you
[1:26:51] and I be here this morning because he
[1:26:54] has something that he has already done.
[1:27:00] Your being here is a victory.
[1:27:04] The fact that you are alive
[1:27:07] and that you are standing here, it is
[1:27:09] because God has already made a way for
[1:27:11] you.
[1:27:12] So whatever need that we have this
[1:27:14] morning,
[1:27:16] the abundant God
[1:27:19] is all sufficient and able
[1:27:21] to supply
[1:27:23] to supply.
[1:27:26] We have come to church to feast with the
[1:27:28] king to have fellowship with him that we
[1:27:32] may worship him.
[1:27:34] The reason why we worship
[1:27:37] is because you know we we believe that
[1:27:40] he's already doing something.
[1:27:43] Sometimes even before you receive your
[1:27:45] answer,
[1:27:48] you begin to to sing and worship
[1:27:50] and think about his goodness
[1:27:53] and then you begin to see it in the
[1:27:54] spirit
[1:27:57] happening
[1:27:59] and then it materializes after.
[1:28:02] That's where we receive our victory
[1:28:07] in worship.
[1:28:09] We believe he's going to minister to us
[1:28:10] today
[1:28:12] through the man of God. So before we
[1:28:15] usher him on the pool,
[1:28:17] I just like you to open your heart.
[1:28:20] Amen. And just open your heart.
[1:28:23] Open your heart. Will you do that?
[1:28:26] Close your eyes. Let's first worship him
[1:28:29] a little bit.
[1:28:33] Every one of us let us wash your hand.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, you
[1:28:39] made our way.
[1:28:44] Whatever you need, he has already made a
[1:28:46] way. You
[1:28:49] made our way.
[1:28:56] when our mouths were against the wall
[1:29:01] and it looked as if it was over.
[1:29:07] You
[1:29:09] made
[1:29:10] our way
[1:29:16] and we're standing
[1:29:20] Lord only because
[1:29:24] you
[1:29:27] away.
[1:29:29] You move mountains.
[1:29:31] You move mountains.
[1:29:34] You cause to fall
[1:29:38] to
[1:29:41] your power
[1:29:44] for miracles.
[1:29:46] Amen.
[1:29:50] There is nothing
[1:30:12] one more time.
[1:30:26] Hallelujah.
[1:30:36] Oh
[1:30:38] my go
[1:30:57] for we are standing.
[1:31:02] Hallelujah.
[1:31:04] Hallelujah. Our
[1:31:09] way
[1:31:32] on the
[1:31:39] Luke's saints, if you soak into his
[1:31:42] presence,
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; the word will just come and penetrate
[1:31:47] through your heart and give you the mind
[1:31:49] of God.
[1:32:11] Wake
[1:32:25] Come
[1:32:30] on.
[1:32:51] Oh, wake up. Now we got
[1:33:17] Hallelujah.

[1:34:36] hands and God is the one who fights my
[1:34:39] battles.
[1:34:42] The one who fights my battles
[1:34:45] this morning.
[1:34:47] I know you're going to speak
[1:34:51] for me this morning. Speak with him.
[1:34:56] Speak with him.
[1:35:00] Speak to me this morning. I surrender
[1:35:02] myself to you.
[1:35:07] May you use your servant
[1:35:10] that he may speak to
[1:35:12] me to hear from you, Lord.
[1:35:16] Lord,
[1:35:22] you
[1:35:24] can wait.
[1:35:29] You're the
[1:35:32] mighty God

[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Don't let anything hinder you
[1:35:53] as you prepare your heart
[1:35:56] for the Lord to minister to you this
[1:35:57] morning.
[1:35:59] Hallelujah.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, we here Lord.
[1:36:12] We are waiting.
[1:36:13] We are yearning, Lord. We're expectant,
[1:36:16] Lord, that you may come and do what only
[1:36:21] you can do, Lord,
[1:36:24] and minister to us, the word of life.
[1:36:28] We know you are here, Lord.
[1:36:30] We know you are here, Lord.
[1:36:33] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:39] Saints as I'm going to usher the man of
[1:36:40] God on the platform.
[1:36:45] I just want to tell you something.
[1:36:48] Uh we had ministers here yesterday, some
[1:36:51] brothers and sisters
[1:36:55] that minister, you know, here at the
[1:36:57] church and
[1:37:00] and we we we had a quality time
[1:37:04] with a man of God, our precious brother
[1:37:06] Simon.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And I just wanted to bring it to your
[1:37:10] attention.
[1:37:13] And if you don't mind standing, it's all
[1:37:15] right.
[1:37:18] Um because if you sit I may take long.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Um it's only God who can do certain
[1:37:26] things.
[1:37:29] Um Pastor Simon did not prepare to be
[1:37:32] here this morning.
[1:37:36] It was not his plans.
[1:37:38] The plans that we had with him
[1:37:41] was for him to come
[1:37:44] and then go to Karamoja
[1:37:46] and then go back. But somehow things
[1:37:49] changed.
[1:37:51] God changed the program
[1:37:54] because God had a problem.
[1:37:57] I've been preaching on a subject,
[1:38:00] political maneuvers
[1:38:03] that obscure the vision.
[1:38:06] I have been trying I have been having a
[1:38:08] burden on my heart
[1:38:10] to
[1:38:12] uh you know tell you the vision of this
[1:38:14] church
[1:38:16] vision of the little ministry that God
[1:38:18] has given us
[1:38:21] and um pastor Simon came yesterday. He
[1:38:23] spoke to the brother uh the the the
[1:38:25] brethren that were here
[1:38:29] and he said many things. It was
[1:38:31] recorded. We can share it with whoever
[1:38:33] wants.
[1:38:35] We will not put it online. But there is
[1:38:38] something significant
[1:38:41] that he said prophetically
[1:38:44] without even knowing what we've been
[1:38:45] talking about.
[1:38:48] He said this. He said, "I see it."
[1:38:52] And if someone is streaming and not part
[1:38:53] of the church,
[1:38:56] please understand this is for Russia.
[1:38:59] He said, "I see it. I I when I look
[1:39:02] around you,
[1:39:04] I see the many that God is going to
[1:39:06] bless
[1:39:09] that they're going to God is going to
[1:39:10] bless them. And it was regarding, you
[1:39:13] know, our financial situation.
[1:39:17] He says, "God is going to bless you."
[1:39:19] And and the reason why he said that
[1:39:22] because he was going he was teaching us
[1:39:23] how to behave after the blessing of God.
[1:39:29] And he did not even know
[1:39:32] what the Lord had ministered to me.
[1:39:35] And I gave it to you here in one of the
[1:39:36] services
[1:39:38] about the the the poor old widow
[1:39:43] that had that did not have anything.
[1:39:47] And she came to the man of God, Elisha,
[1:39:51] and she said, "My I don't have anything.
[1:39:53] My husband is dead and I have de debts.
[1:39:57] I have a lot of debts. I need to pay
[1:39:59] them. I have nothing. Help me, man of
[1:40:01] God. My my my husband was a servant.
[1:40:05] And and the man of God told her, "What
[1:40:08] do you have?" She said, "I have a little
[1:40:10] cruise of weight."
[1:40:13] He said, "Okay, now go out, borrow,
[1:40:17] borrow as many vessels as you can
[1:40:19] and bring them here." And it was
[1:40:22] according to her ability.
[1:40:24] She borrowed as many vessels as she
[1:40:26] could as she could. And she brought them
[1:40:30] in empty vessels,
[1:40:32] not even hers. She borrowed them and
[1:40:36] brought them in. And uh you know the man
[1:40:38] of God now told her, "Take the oil and
[1:40:42] begin powering
[1:40:44] into into all these vessels."
[1:40:47] And the oil was little,
[1:40:50] but the oil like filled all the vessels.
[1:40:55] And the prophet of God told her, "Now
[1:40:57] take it out. Sell the oil."
[1:41:01] And after selling the oil, pay all your
[1:41:05] debts and the rest live on it. Pay all
[1:41:08] your debts and the rest live on it. And
[1:41:11] then out of there, the Lord gave me an
[1:41:13] inspiration for us.
[1:41:16] When we started out, do we have the
[1:41:17] board here?
[1:41:20] Now, the board, I don't know if the
[1:41:22] brothers brought the board. You know,
[1:41:24] the Lord gave me a vision.
[1:41:27] And and if you don't mind standing, it's
[1:41:29] okay. I'm standing too. So, don't think
[1:41:32] about that you're standing.
[1:41:34] And and so, you know, the Lord gave me
[1:41:37] that vision because we needed a huge sum
[1:41:40] of money.
[1:41:42] And we did not have brother Brian is the
[1:41:44] body here
[1:41:48] helped me to carry the body.
[1:41:50] And so the Lord gave me this vision. You
[1:41:53] know how we are going to raise our land.
[1:41:57] Amen. And and I told I told you it was
[1:42:00] just like I would call it a one.
[1:42:04] I said here's what the Lord wants us to
[1:42:06] do.
[1:42:08] Each of you
[1:42:10] give a pledge. The pledge you're going
[1:42:12] to give is going actually to be that
[1:42:16] empty vessel.
[1:42:19] You don't have it. You're borrowing.
[1:42:23] You're getting the vessel by faith.
[1:42:26] You're bringing the vessel. You're
[1:42:27] telling Lord, as for me, I'm going to
[1:42:31] give 2 million, one, 500.
[1:42:35] And Lord, this is what I am able to do.
[1:42:39] Okay, just a moment. You you can hold
[1:42:40] it. Just stand. Come come come right
[1:42:42] here. And and and then I told you
[1:42:45] um see and then I told you that uh once
[1:42:50] you give that empty vessel
[1:42:53] be don't pledge and be quiet.
[1:42:58] Pledge by faith. But there's something
[1:43:02] God has given to you.
[1:43:05] It may be small but it is your seed
[1:43:08] begin powering
[1:43:11] every week. Every week many of you have
[1:43:14] faithfully done it
[1:43:16] every week. Every week and I told you
[1:43:19] this and actually it wasn't me who told
[1:43:21] you that. I said watch
[1:43:25] if you do that faithfully.
[1:43:28] The moment you finish
[1:43:30] powering in,
[1:43:33] watch the blessing coming upon
[1:43:36] your business, upon whatever you have
[1:43:38] been doing. After I said it, I said to
[1:43:42] myself, Lord, those were not my words.
[1:43:45] It was your word, you will accomplish
[1:43:47] it. And here is a man from New York who
[1:43:51] didn't know about that at all.
[1:43:54] He said when I see here I see many of
[1:43:57] you are going to be
[1:43:59] what is that can only be God that can
[1:44:03] only be God and on Wednesday you know he
[1:44:06] was inspired to start the subject
[1:44:09] which I believe he's also going to
[1:44:10] continue with today I don't know
[1:44:13] and because he promised to us that he
[1:44:14] would continue with it
[1:44:16] very very important subject for our
[1:44:18] church at the stage where we are
[1:44:22] this is a man that god has used to start
[1:44:25] churches in Africa, West Africa where he
[1:44:26] came from then moved to the US and for
[1:44:30] more than I think 25 years
[1:44:35] a ministry there and and God has blessed
[1:44:37] it and God has blessed his work and he's
[1:44:41] in full-time ministry
[1:44:44] and I can say we are very honored as a
[1:44:46] church
[1:44:48] to have him here with us today.
[1:44:54] Can another brother, brother Brian, come
[1:44:55] on.
[1:44:57] This board will just be back in the
[1:44:59] back,
[1:45:02] but I just wanted you to visualize the
[1:45:04] vision
[1:45:06] for our land.
[1:45:10] And uh so yeah, there's going to be a
[1:45:13] little editing done
[1:45:16] because it's supposed to be 220.
[1:45:20] We started on zero.
[1:45:23] So you can see how we are progressing.
[1:45:26] We're going to have an indicator here.
[1:45:30] It will keep indicating where we are.
[1:45:33] Brother Joel, where are we now?
[1:45:39] Did you announce it today this morning?
[1:45:41] Do you have like the overall total
[1:45:45] out of 220?
[1:45:48] So I think we are about uh do you get
[1:45:51] did you get it?
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[1:45:59] He's checking it. Oh okay. So but I
[1:46:03] believe we should be around 140
[1:46:05] something.
[1:46:07] We just we're just a few to go.
[1:46:11] I tell you what, if the Lord gives a
[1:46:13] vision,
[1:46:15] he accomplishes it.
[1:46:18] This was so huge for us.
[1:46:20] But the Lord has been faithful. And I
[1:46:23] tell you what, God bless you, brothers.
[1:46:25] I think I'll go now.
[1:46:28] You can just take it. Thank you.
[1:46:32] We just want now to go to the word.
[1:46:34] But I want you to know the purpose of
[1:46:38] this message
[1:46:41] is the change of our bodies,
[1:46:44] the rapture,
[1:46:47] going beyond the curtain of time,
[1:46:51] ruling with Christ.
[1:46:53] But while we are here, we are not
[1:46:57] aimless.
[1:47:00] God has called us for a purpose.
[1:47:04] And I believe this morning God is going
[1:47:08] to speak to you as an individual.
[1:47:11] Open your heart. Open your mind and
[1:47:14] expect God to speak to you this morning.
[1:47:18] How many came under expectation?
[1:47:21] Amen. I'm also under expectation.
[1:47:25] And Pastor Simon, thank you for
[1:47:28] sacrificing your time.
[1:47:30] I know there are many many places that
[1:47:32] would have wanted to have you this
[1:47:33] morning
[1:47:36] but you know you've labored among us.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Join me to tell him God
[1:47:41] bless you.
[1:47:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:48] So let us have a um a little song as our
[1:47:52] brother comes.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:59] Praise God.
[1:48:01] Hallelujah.
[1:48:05] Thank you Lord.
[1:48:08] Thank you Lord.

[1:48:30] you surrender all to him this morning?
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; I will live
[1:48:39] life
[1:48:41] and trusting
[1:48:44] in
[1:48:46] his presence
[1:48:49] daily.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; I surrender. Sing it.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; I
[1:48:57] surrender.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, we surrender everything to you
[1:49:01] this morning.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; All our mind, all our thoughts.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; I
[1:49:08] surrender.
[1:49:12] Oh,
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; come and speak to us this morning, Lord.
[1:49:19] To thee.
[1:49:28] I
[1:49:31] surrender.
[1:49:42] Bow our heads in prayer.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father,
[1:49:49] we thank you this morning
[1:49:51] for this opportunity.
[1:49:54] you've given unto us once more
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; to come into your presence
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; to worship you.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; We ask that you will come this morning
[1:50:05] and help us.
[1:50:08] Give us grace
[1:50:10] to speak the oracles of God.
[1:50:13] Give us uncction.
[1:50:16] Give us utterance.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Bless the interpreter,
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; myself the congregation.
[1:50:23] Lord, I pray
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; that you bless the pastor of this
[1:50:27] church, our brother,
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; bless the offices,
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; the government of the church. May you be
[1:50:33] with each and everyone.
[1:50:36] Come by our way
[1:50:38] and say something that will help us
[1:50:40] today
[1:50:42] in Jesus name we pray.
[1:50:45] Amen.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:50:51] want to greet you all in the name of our
[1:50:52] Lord Jesus Christ. I want us to read the
[1:50:55] scriptures. Then I have you seated.
[1:50:58] A very simple familiar scripture.
[1:51:03] St. John chapter 3 verse 16.
[1:51:09] I think it's a scripture we learn from
[1:51:11] Sunday school.
[1:51:14] But I trust that God will help us this
[1:51:16] morning.
[1:51:19] uh to uh just say something.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. John 3:16.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:51:33] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:51:36] believeth in him shall not perish but
[1:51:41] have everlasting life.
[1:52:01] May God bless the reading of his word.
[1:52:05] Please take your seat.
[1:52:09] And Wednesday I was speaking to you on
[1:52:11] offerings and tithings.
[1:52:16] We just want to continue our thought on
[1:52:18] that
[1:52:21] because I realized that uh this is the
[1:52:23] area that God fights us so much
[1:52:26] sometimes. I mean the devil
[1:52:32] when you get the revelation
[1:52:36] and then it will bring the blessings of
[1:52:39] God upon your life.
[1:52:44] Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; God himself,
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; God will not ask you to do something
[1:52:54] that he himself doesn't do or has not
[1:52:57] done.
[1:53:04] Amen.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; God is a giver.
[1:53:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:12] Everything that we have need of, he gave
[1:53:14] us.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; He gave us life freely.
[1:53:22] In other words, he offered life to us.
[1:53:26] He gave us food. He gave us fishes. He
[1:53:31] gave us the air that we breathe in.
[1:53:34] He is a giver.
[1:53:37] The Bible says, "God so loved the world
[1:53:41] that he gave."
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:52] We spoke about the laws of God on
[1:53:54] Wednesday.
[1:53:58] God has put or place spiritual laws or
[1:54:01] natural laws and spiritual law.
[1:54:07] When you obey them,
[1:54:10] they'll work for you.
[1:54:14] There's a law of sewing and reaping.
[1:54:19] The Bible says you reap whatever you
[1:54:21] sow.
[1:54:26] God
[1:54:28] swed his son.
[1:54:32] That's right.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:54:34] By the death of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:39] today we are the fruits of that seed
[1:54:45] in sewing.
[1:54:48] You
[1:54:49] have to be careful what you sow.
[1:54:55] There are good seeds and there are bad
[1:54:56] seeds.
[1:54:59] There are certain seeds that we sow.
[1:55:05] Let's take for example an orange seed.
[1:55:11] It's just one seed
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; you saw on the ground
[1:55:16] it comes forth.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; But that tree
[1:55:24] at a certain season
[1:55:27] it will bring forth fruit.
[1:55:31] That's right. And sometimes for a very
[1:55:33] long time,
[1:55:36] maybe for years and generations.
[1:55:41] We have to be careful what you sow
[1:55:45] because you will reap what you sow.
[1:55:51] God himself said, "The word that I
[1:55:53] speak,
[1:55:56] the word that I send out,"
[1:55:59] because Jesus said, "The word is a
[1:56:01] seed."
[1:56:03] The word of God is a seed that a sen.
[1:56:10] And he said, "The word that I in the
[1:56:13] word that I send
[1:56:16] will not return unto me void.
[1:56:22] That's right.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; He did not say the word will not return
[1:56:27] or when it is coming back
[1:56:30] is not coming the same way
[1:56:33] is not it will it will come in
[1:56:35] abundance.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; When we look at the Mosaic law, the law
[1:56:44] of Moses,
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; God has God brought the children of
[1:56:50] Israel out of Egypt.
[1:56:54] And when we look at the Old Testament,
[1:56:57] it seems everything about their worship
[1:56:59] is just offering, offering, offering.
[1:57:07] There was a burnt offering.
[1:57:11] There was a meal offering.
[1:57:14] There was a peace offering.
[1:57:19] There was a sin offering of
[1:57:20] purification.
[1:57:25] There was a trespass offering.
[1:57:28] There was a wave offering.
[1:57:31] There was a drink offering.
[1:57:34] There was a first fruits.
[1:57:39] These offerings were detailed in the
[1:57:41] Levit in the book of Leviticus.
[1:57:45] Hallelujah.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament,
[1:57:49] God will judge a worship believer
[1:57:53] by the offerings they give.
[1:57:59] Amen. Amen. If your offering is
[1:58:02] accepted,
[1:58:05] then you are accepted.
[1:58:08] If your offering is rejected,
[1:58:10] then you are rejected.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; In the message, the prophet Elisha said,
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Elijah foreseen the shadow of Christ.
[1:58:34] Knowing that this meal represented him
[1:58:40] which it was the wave offering,
[1:58:45] the he offering,
[1:58:47] the meal offering
[1:58:50] and all the offerings pertained to
[1:58:53] Christ.
[1:58:58] Prophet of God said all of the offerings
[1:59:01] they were given were pertaining to
[1:59:03] Christ.
[1:59:07] Hallelujah.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; So we read in scripture, God so loved
[1:59:10] the world that he gave.
[1:59:14] Given is the character of God.
[1:59:18] Praise the name of the Lord. Life is a
[1:59:21] gift from God.
[1:59:23] Your home is a gift.
[1:59:26] If you are smart enough to get an
[1:59:28] education,
[1:59:31] who gave you that intelligence?
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; It is God that gave you that
[1:59:35] intelligence.
[1:59:39] Amen.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the way you look at people and
[1:59:43] people are about to backslide
[1:59:48] sometimes you will see that it begin to
[1:59:50] reflect in their giving, their offer.
[1:59:57] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Giving must come from the heart.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; On Thursday we we spoke I mean Wednesday
[2:00:09] we spoke about how Amen. we should not
[2:00:11] give grudgingly.
[2:00:14] Wow.
[2:00:19] Every man according has a purpose in his
[2:00:22] heart.
[2:00:24] Let him give not grudgingly
[2:00:27] or of necessity.
[2:00:30] God love a cheerful giver.
[2:00:37] It becomes very difficult for people to
[2:00:39] give
[2:00:43] because the devil knows the law.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The blessings that follows you
[2:00:50] when you give.
[2:00:54] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; So we read also where Cain and Abel
[2:01:00] coming to God presenting their offerings
[2:01:03] to God.
[2:01:07] And when we speak about offerings,
[2:01:10] we are not only looking at it from
[2:01:12] monetary terms.
[2:01:15] Amen. Our time is an offering to God.
[2:01:20] We give God praise offering,
[2:01:24] worship, special songs. They are all
[2:01:28] offerings we give to God.
[2:01:30] If somebody is playing the instrument,
[2:01:33] Amen. is making an offering to God.
[2:01:37] Can we say amen? Preaching is an
[2:01:39] offering also.
[2:01:43] That's right.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; When somebody's coming to pray,
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; the song leader will say, "Can you
[2:01:48] please come and offer to God a prayer?
[2:01:56] Blessed be the name of the Lord." So
[2:01:59] there were many types of offerings.
[2:02:03] There was an incense offering also in
[2:02:05] the Bible
[2:02:08] which represented the prayers of the
[2:02:10] saints.
[2:02:14] Why did God demand so much?
[2:02:18] Because at that time in the Old
[2:02:20] Testament
[2:02:21] there was no Holy Ghost
[2:02:25] given to men. So the Holy Spirit will
[2:02:28] abide in men so that he can come and
[2:02:30] abide. The Holy Ghost was not abiding in
[2:02:32] him.
[2:02:36] The only way you can tell that this
[2:02:38] person is truly saved.
[2:02:42] It was his ability to give to God.
[2:02:48] That's right.
[2:02:51] God in the Old Testament,
[2:02:54] God was like, "Bring this, bring this,
[2:02:56] bring this."
[2:02:58] And in doing that, God was watching the
[2:03:01] soul of man
[2:03:03] and the condition of the heart.
[2:03:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When you make a
[2:03:11] gift to God,
[2:03:13] God will testify of your gift.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "By faith, Abel offered
[2:03:22] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[2:03:26] Cain.
[2:03:31] which he obtained the witness that he
[2:03:34] was righteous.
[2:03:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The offering
[2:03:41] that Cain brought to God.
[2:03:45] Amen. It showed that he was a righteous
[2:03:48] man
[2:03:51] and God testified of his gift.
[2:03:55] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:03:57] Amen.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; God reckoned righteousness to Abel by an
[2:04:02] offering or sacrifice he brought to God.
[2:04:10] his gift and offering witness that he
[2:04:12] was a righteous man.
[2:04:16] The way you give God,
[2:04:19] whether it's your time,
[2:04:21] your time of coming to church, studying
[2:04:24] the word, your time to God's work
[2:04:28] testifies whether you are righteous or
[2:04:31] unrighteous.
[2:04:34] evil.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; When a man says to God, I love you.
[2:04:48] I want to follow you.
[2:04:51] And God says to him, "Yes, well, I will
[2:04:53] show you a land."
[2:04:55] All right. He say, "I'll follow you
[2:04:57] then."
[2:04:58] And God at sometime
[2:05:02] will test his salvation
[2:05:05] by a demand for an extra thing.
[2:05:16] Amen.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; God will come to Abraham and say give me
[2:05:19] Isaac.
[2:05:22] And Abraham will say okay Lord. And the
[2:05:25] Lord will let him walk step walk every
[2:05:28] step of the way.
[2:05:31] So where he will actually offer
[2:05:35] Isaac as a sacrifice.
[2:05:42] That's right.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:05:50] Tithing,
[2:05:51] offerings
[2:05:54] is a commandment of the Lord.
[2:05:59] It started before Moses.
[2:06:05] Tithing is not an Old Testament law
[2:06:10] because it was our father Abraham
[2:06:14] who first gave tithing to Melkisedc.
[2:06:20] Are we together? By revelation
[2:06:24] I said on Wednesday when Mechisedc
[2:06:26] appeared to Abraham,
[2:06:29] he came as a priest to Abraham.
[2:06:32] And Abraham by inspiration
[2:06:34] knew that if this man is a priest,
[2:06:37] can we say amen? I need to pay tithe to
[2:06:40] the priest.
[2:06:44] Can we say amen? Later on, God will put
[2:06:47] it in the law.
[2:06:50] Are we together? And so we know that he
[2:06:52] told his church,
[2:06:54] the seed of Abraham
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; to pay their tithes,
[2:06:59] Amen. to the priest.
[2:07:02] So when you are paying your tithe,
[2:07:05] you are not paying it to the pastor, but
[2:07:08] you are obeying a commandment of the
[2:07:10] Lord.
[2:07:19] Amen.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; In the Bible,
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; if you look at the Bible,
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; God wanted tithing for everything.
[2:07:33] God wanted a tithe of even the people.
[2:07:38] He wanted a tithe of animals.
[2:07:41] He wanted a tithe of everything.
[2:07:45] Can we say amen?
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; The reason why Israel did not ti give
[2:07:50] people as a tithe
[2:07:54] is because God have already taken Levi.
[2:08:00] Can I say amen? The tribe of Levi
[2:08:04] was a tight to God.
[2:08:08] Hallelujah.
[2:08:11] What am I trying to show you? When we
[2:08:14] are doing these things in the natural,
[2:08:17] we have more spiritual connotation to
[2:08:20] it.
[2:08:22] Can we say amen than just doing? Because
[2:08:25] when you obeying,
[2:08:27] you're obeying Christ.
[2:08:32] When the children of Israel went to
[2:08:34] Babylon,
[2:08:36] when they were coming back,
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; God said, "A tenth,
[2:08:43] a tithe of those that went to Babylon
[2:08:45] will return." Only a tight
[2:08:52] Isaiah 6.
[2:08:54] The Bible says, "And and then said the
[2:08:57] Lord, how long
[2:09:00] And he answered, "Until the cities be
[2:09:03] wasted without inhabitants,
[2:09:07] and the houses without men,
[2:09:10] and the land will be utterly desolate,
[2:09:14] and the Lord have removed men far away,
[2:09:18] and there be a great forsaking in the
[2:09:20] midst of the land.
[2:09:23] For years yet in it shall attent
[2:09:28] and it shall return.
[2:09:31] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So God
[2:09:34] is saying that a tithe of Israel will
[2:09:36] return.
[2:09:40] Do you know that brother said
[2:09:44] God is going to take a tenth or a tide
[2:09:48] of all the human race.
[2:09:51] Amen.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Let me read a quote to you.
[2:09:58] He was praying in the message of Christ.
[2:10:02] He said, "Oh Lord, you are God. You are
[2:10:06] God forever more. And we are so happy to
[2:10:11] know that you promise that you have a
[2:10:14] remnant
[2:10:16] when you come to the earth
[2:10:19] regardless of what goes or come.
[2:10:22] There is going to be a people that's
[2:10:25] going to be ready.
[2:10:28] The prophet said, "We know that there is
[2:10:32] a tithing
[2:10:34] that man gives to God.
[2:10:38] And there is a tithing
[2:10:41] amongst the people.
[2:10:44] Perhaps maybe we will say
[2:10:47] a tenth of all the world's harvest
[2:10:50] through the ages will be the elected
[2:10:53] that's been called.
[2:11:00] Praise the name of the Lord. Very
[2:11:04] from the time of Eden
[2:11:07] to our time, it will be a tent.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; It will be a tight. Can we say amen? Of
[2:11:15] the human race
[2:11:18] that will be raptured
[2:11:20] that will be saved.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; So when you are bringing your tithe, the
[2:11:28] tithe is also speaking about you.
[2:11:32] Can we say amen?
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Because every scripture
[2:11:37] say if you read any scripture and you
[2:11:40] don't see Christ in that scripture,
[2:11:42] go and read it again.
[2:11:45] You never read it well.
[2:11:48] Christ is the word.
[2:11:50] Can we say amen? And you are a part of
[2:11:54] Christ.
[2:11:56] The bride is a tithe.
[2:11:59] the people that God is going to save.
[2:12:02] Can we say amen? They are tied
[2:12:06] for all humanity.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; So when God is saying,
[2:12:15] pay your tithes and offering,
[2:12:18] you must know what is more than just
[2:12:20] bringing.
[2:12:22] Hallelujah. Amen. It's a representation.
[2:12:31] May God help us
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; in the message El Shadai
[2:12:39] said when you come to total obedience
[2:12:42] then you can have possession
[2:12:46] but until you totally obey
[2:12:49] you completely surrender
[2:12:54] your own thoughts
[2:12:57] your own will,
[2:12:59] your own mind. Let the mind of Christ
[2:13:02] operate in you.
[2:13:05] Amen.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; We are not called to obey a portion of
[2:13:10] the word and leave a portion.
[2:13:15] We are called to full obedience.
[2:13:19] Amen.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; this God that we serve,
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; it keeps his word.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you are in a village.
[2:13:34] I don't care the circumstances you find
[2:13:36] yourself in.
[2:13:37] If you obey the word of the Lord,
[2:13:41] God will miss you where you are. God
[2:13:44] will bless you. Can we say amen?
[2:13:48] The blessings of God
[2:13:51] are not determined by the economy of the
[2:13:53] nation.
[2:13:55] It is determined by your obedience to
[2:13:57] the word of God.
[2:14:00] Because he said you will reap whatever
[2:14:01] you sow.
[2:14:12] Brother said total obedience to all of
[2:14:14] his commandments.
[2:14:17] will give you a right to the tree of
[2:14:19] life.
[2:14:23] The rich young ruler
[2:14:26] had a desire to enter into the kingdom.
[2:14:31] And so he went to Jesus,
[2:14:33] he said, "Good master, what shall I do
[2:14:36] to inherit eternal life?"
[2:14:39] He knew that he had kept the
[2:14:41] commandments
[2:14:43] for his heart told him
[2:14:45] you don't have eternal life.
[2:14:48] Just like some of us, we can attend
[2:14:51] services
[2:14:53] or in your heart, you are not really
[2:14:57] sure whether you are saved.
[2:15:02] So Jesus look at the young man. He said
[2:15:05] nobody's good but God alone.
[2:15:09] He said, "However,
[2:15:11] keep the commandments." The young man
[2:15:14] said, "I did since I was a boy."
[2:15:18] And Jesus looked at him. The Bible says
[2:15:21] he loved him.
[2:15:26] Let's think about that.
[2:15:29] A man that Jesus loved
[2:15:33] ended up in hell.
[2:15:39] Jesus said unto him,
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; one thing you lack, if that you go and
[2:15:45] sell all that you have,
[2:15:48] give to the poor, come and follow me.
[2:15:55] I don't believe that God wanted the man
[2:15:57] or Jesus wanted the man to be poor.
[2:16:04] I don't think that God wanted him to
[2:16:06] remain with no home.
[2:16:11] If Jesus told him sell all
[2:16:16] and all means all,
[2:16:20] his house, his business, his chariot or
[2:16:24] cars.
[2:16:26] Can we say amen? Jesus said, "Sell all
[2:16:30] that you have.
[2:16:34] That would mean he's going to remain
[2:16:36] with nothing.
[2:16:38] He was going to remain with nothing.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; What was Jesus doing?
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus was testing his obedience.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. When
[2:16:54] God came to Abraham
[2:16:56] in Genesis 22,
[2:16:58] he said, "Take now thy son,
[2:17:02] thine only son
[2:17:05] Isaac whom thou lovest."
[2:17:10] Amen. And get in the land of Moriah,
[2:17:13] and offer him therefore a burnt offering
[2:17:17] upon one of the mountains which I will
[2:17:19] tell thee of.
[2:17:22] God was asking an offering.
[2:17:25] Can you say amen? But the offering he
[2:17:27] was asking was a son of Abraham.
[2:17:31] Take thy son, thine only son, the one
[2:17:36] that you love.
[2:17:39] Can we say amen?
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; When we are given God an offering,
[2:17:51] It must go with pain.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; If there is no pain to it,
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; then it's not a sacrifice.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; When Abraham was willing to offer Isaac,
[2:18:20] It seemed as if Abraham was losing.
[2:18:27] He waited for this boy for 25 years.
[2:18:32] God who gave him the son
[2:18:35] said now I want you to offer him to me.
[2:18:41] When God has blessed us, we never have a
[2:18:45] job. God give you a job.
[2:18:48] God gave you a hope. God has blessed
[2:18:51] you. God's word is telling you offer.
[2:18:56] Hallelujah.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; You have a building project.
[2:19:01] Can you say amen? And you have made
[2:19:04] pledges
[2:19:06] and and and and and some of you are
[2:19:07] given.
[2:19:09] Some of you well, you give sparingly.
[2:19:13] You give once in a while.
[2:19:16] Can we say amen?
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; But God want to bless you.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; God want to prosper you. For God walk
[2:19:29] according to his laws.
[2:19:34] Salvation.
[2:19:36] Salvation is free.
[2:19:39] Salvation is unmmerited.
[2:19:42] Salvation is grace.
[2:19:45] Brother said
[2:19:47] the blessings of God, there are
[2:19:50] conditions attached to it.
[2:19:55] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:19:57] Amen. And so God is asking Abraham.
[2:20:01] God was testing Abraham
[2:20:03] and every son of God, every daughter of
[2:20:07] God that comes to God will be tested by
[2:20:11] God.
[2:20:14] He told the children of Israel,
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; "Silver and gold is mine,
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; if I'm hungry,
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; I will not ask you for food because I
[2:20:25] own everything."
[2:20:27] Can we say amen? When you are given to
[2:20:30] God,
[2:20:32] you are acknowledging
[2:20:34] that he is the creator of the heavens
[2:20:37] and the earth.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Abraham
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; when Melisedc
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; appeared to him and Melisedc
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; introduce himself as the possessor
[2:20:54] of the heaven and the earth. Abraham
[2:20:58] realized that whatever he has received,
[2:21:02] Amen came from God.
[2:21:05] And therefore, I'm acknowledging
[2:21:09] whatever you have given me. Whatever I
[2:21:12] have today is coming from you. I'm
[2:21:15] giving you offering. I'm giving you a
[2:21:17] tithe. I'm worshiping you. Can we say
[2:21:21] amen by giving you this offering?
[2:21:27] I
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; I want us to change our mentality
[2:21:33] about giving
[2:21:40] everyday pledge. Every day offering
[2:21:42] everyday
[2:21:47] I think I will leave this church.
[2:21:53] The pastor is asking too much money.
[2:21:58] It's not the pastor
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; is the Holy Ghost.
[2:22:05] The children of Israel
[2:22:08] when they left Egypt
[2:22:11] before they left, God gave a promise to
[2:22:14] Abraham.
[2:22:16] He said when they are coming out they
[2:22:19] will come with a great success.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Actually
[2:22:28] God made Egypt to pay
[2:22:32] for
[2:22:33] all the years of slavery.
[2:22:39] When the hour came for them to leave,
[2:22:42] God moved upon the Egyptians.
[2:22:45] they begin to borrow.
[2:22:48] You can go into a man's house
[2:22:52] and say, "Can you give me a million
[2:22:53] dollars?"
[2:22:55] If they have that money, they will give
[2:22:57] it to you.
[2:22:58] When Israel came out, they came out with
[2:23:02] gold
[2:23:04] different different things.
[2:23:06] Can we say amen? And they crossed over.
[2:23:10] Are you hearing me? After they came out
[2:23:14] in the process of time, they wanted to
[2:23:17] build a temple.
[2:23:19] God who gave them those things
[2:23:22] came back through the prophet to tell
[2:23:25] them to bring gold to give offerings.
[2:23:29] Can we say amen of what he has blessed
[2:23:32] them with?
[2:23:35] When you come to the realization
[2:23:38] that whatever you have come from God,
[2:23:41] you say amen, you will give to God
[2:23:44] unrely.
[2:23:49] And the Bible says they gave so much
[2:23:54] until the priest had to stop them from
[2:23:56] giving by the prophet.
[2:24:06] We must be willing
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; to give God our time.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; What did Paul say?
[2:24:17] He said, "Offer yourself
[2:24:20] as a living sacrifice,
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; holy
[2:24:27] and acceptable."
[2:24:30] Amen.
[2:24:31] When you are given an offering,
[2:24:34] it must be holy.
[2:24:36] If it is not holy, it will not be
[2:24:39] acceptable.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:47] Amen. Amen.
[2:24:50] Prayer without ceasing.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Prayer, you offer prayer to God.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; It is the will of God.
[2:25:01] in Christ Jesus concerning you.
[2:25:05] He said, "Rejoice in the Lord always
[2:25:09] and again I say rejoice."
[2:25:12] Jesus said, "Love the Lord thy God,
[2:25:17] with all thy heart,
[2:25:20] with all thy soul,
[2:25:22] with all thy mind, with all thy
[2:25:25] strength."
[2:25:27] Can we say amen? So when we are serving
[2:25:29] God, we serve God with our strength. We
[2:25:33] serve God with everything that is in us.
[2:25:36] Hallelujah. When we are coming to
[2:25:38] church, we should come with all our
[2:25:40] hearts. David said, I was glad when they
[2:25:44] said unto me, let us go into the house
[2:25:46] of the Lord
[2:25:48] because in the house of the Lord, there
[2:25:51] is healing. In the house of God, there
[2:25:54] is deliverance. In the house of God,
[2:25:56] there is the Holy Ghost. Blessed be the
[2:25:59] name of the Lord. That is why we come.
[2:26:02] When we are worshiping, we sing from our
[2:26:05] heart. Can we say amen? We are not
[2:26:08] singing for the pastor. We are not
[2:26:10] singing for the song leader. We must
[2:26:13] worship him. We must worship him with
[2:26:16] all our heart. When you are playing the
[2:26:19] instrument,
[2:26:21] it's an offering to God. You must play
[2:26:24] this instrument with all of your heart.
[2:26:27] Can we say amen? When you are sweeping
[2:26:31] is an offering, it's a service to God.
[2:26:35] Do it with all your heart. Praise the
[2:26:38] name of the Lord. Don't complain. Don't
[2:26:41] grumble.
[2:26:43] Hallelujah.
[2:26:48] Hallelujah.
[2:26:53] You know
[2:26:56] in Mark chapter 12,
[2:26:59] Jesus went to the temple.
[2:27:02] Uh he sat against the treasury.
[2:27:07] They were putting money
[2:27:10] which came and they put money.
[2:27:13] The Bible says there came a certain poor
[2:27:15] woman
[2:27:17] and she throw in two m
[2:27:20] which make a father.
[2:27:24] He called him unto his disciples
[2:27:26] and said unto him,
[2:27:29] them, verily I say unto you, this poor
[2:27:32] widow
[2:27:34] have cast more in
[2:27:37] than all they which have cast into the
[2:27:39] trench.
[2:27:42] For all they did cast of their
[2:27:43] abundance,
[2:27:46] she of her wanting
[2:27:49] all that she had
[2:27:52] and all her living
[2:28:01] Jesus.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; You see, the little that you have,
[2:28:09] put it in the hand of Jesus.
[2:28:13] Amen.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:28:17] these things must be by revelation.
[2:28:21] You cannot give and go out grumbling.
[2:28:28] If I don't if I don't pledge,
[2:28:31] you know, everybody will know that I'm
[2:28:32] not pledging.
[2:28:35] You try to pledge,
[2:28:39] you go out complaining.
[2:28:41] God will never bless you.
[2:28:45] It's better not to even give.
[2:28:52] That's right.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; This widow,
[2:28:55] people were giving. People were giving
[2:28:58] maybe 10,000, maybe 50,000. But then
[2:29:02] when she came, she only gave two. But
[2:29:06] what she gave was all that she had.
[2:29:11] For you to give all that you have, it
[2:29:14] has to be by divine revelation.
[2:29:18] Blessed be the name of the Lord. She
[2:29:20] gave all. And Jesus said, "This woman
[2:29:24] has given more than all the people." Can
[2:29:28] we say amen? When you are giving to God,
[2:29:32] give your all.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; If you are giving your time, give all of
[2:29:36] your time.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? Amen.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; If you are giving offering, let it come
[2:29:42] from your heart. Can you say amen? When
[2:29:45] you are paying the tithe, let it come
[2:29:47] from your heart.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[2:29:53] there are people that come to church.
[2:29:56] They don't have nothing. They come, they
[2:29:59] will start with a ministry
[2:30:01] as as young as you people. All of you
[2:30:03] are young. that the pastor will labor,
[2:30:07] pray for them, preach to them. God begin
[2:30:10] to bless them. They get good jobs. They
[2:30:13] get, you know, they are blessed. They up
[2:30:15] there and now they have a very big
[2:30:18] salary.
[2:30:19] And when they look at the money, they
[2:30:22] think that the tithing is too much for
[2:30:24] the pastor.
[2:30:29] May God help us. It's a lack of
[2:30:32] revelation.
[2:30:33] In fact, that money
[2:30:37] that money is not your money. The tithe
[2:30:40] is not your money, the tithing is money.
[2:30:44] Can I say amen?
[2:30:47] If you are not faithful in paying your
[2:30:50] tithe, if you are not faithful in paying
[2:30:53] your offerings, if you are not faithful
[2:30:56] in doing the things of God, hallelujah,
[2:30:59] God will not bless you. You will not
[2:31:01] receive the blessings.
[2:31:03] If you want the blessings of God, you
[2:31:06] should come to obedience to the word of
[2:31:08] God because it is a law of God.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; We have to be careful what we do in
[2:31:22] church.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; Ananas and Safaria died.
[2:31:31] What caused their death?
[2:31:33] is because of offering and place.
[2:31:38] They were making pledges to
[2:31:42] people were selling their land.
[2:31:45] They were bringing it to the apostles.
[2:31:52] Be careful.
[2:31:56] They went and they sold their land.
[2:32:02] And they kept some of the money.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; Apostle Peter was not there,
[2:32:12] but the Holy Ghost was there
[2:32:18] that day.
[2:32:21] But Ananas came to church.
[2:32:24] Sister Ananas
[2:32:27] was late.
[2:32:33] He came.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; I'm pledging this amount of money.
[2:32:44] And whatever he said,
[2:32:47] Peter looked at him.
[2:32:50] Brother Ananas,
[2:32:54] this money you have been going to
[2:32:56] pledge,
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; is that all that you sold the land?
[2:33:04] Maybe. I'm saying maybe.
[2:33:08] Maybe he told the apostles
[2:33:10] that I'm going to sell the land
[2:33:14] wherever I sold the land for
[2:33:17] I'm going to bring the money.
[2:33:22] But probably when he sold the land,
[2:33:25] he look at the money. Ah, this is too
[2:33:28] much.
[2:33:33] And she he and the wife agreed.
[2:33:39] Maybe an never fulfill his pledge.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:33:49] he made a pledge.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God give you the money,
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; but you use it for other things
[2:33:57] and you bring in a little.
[2:34:05] Peter said,
[2:34:07] Why has Satan filled your heart
[2:34:11] to lie against the Holy Ghost
[2:34:14] and when he was exposed
[2:34:17] he dropped dead
[2:34:19] the brothers took him and bury him
[2:34:24] that means they never even stopped the
[2:34:26] service
[2:34:28] maybe some deacons Peter went
[2:34:33] service was going on
[2:34:36] Ananas,
[2:34:38] it's not good to come to church late.
[2:34:43] If she was there on time, she would have
[2:34:46] known what had happened.
[2:34:49] Oh my my.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; So maybe that day she put on her best
[2:34:53] clothing
[2:34:57] to put a show in church.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; Wore the best shoes.
[2:35:07] because they just sold a lot. Maybe she
[2:35:10] bought the most expensive dress.
[2:35:13] She came walking, you know, walking to
[2:35:15] church
[2:35:17] because she wanted everybody to be in
[2:35:19] church.
[2:35:21] So that when she walk now to give the
[2:35:23] testimony,
[2:35:31] she did not know what happened.
[2:35:35] Peter said,
[2:35:37] "Sister,
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; is this money
[2:35:41] your brother, you your your husband
[2:35:44] brought? Is it
[2:35:47] that you guys sold money?"
[2:35:51] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:35:53] Hallelujah. He said, "The same feet that
[2:35:58] bury your husband,
[2:36:01] they're just at the door.
[2:36:03] She fell and died.
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; We have to be very careful
[2:36:15] what we do in church.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; This is very simple.
[2:36:23] Brother said the days of Ananas
[2:36:26] the days of Ananas and Safar
[2:36:30] will come again.
[2:36:32] in this message.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:36:50] I say may the Lord help us.
[2:36:57] Prophet of God said we should not
[2:37:00] forsake to assemble. ourselves together
[2:37:04] as the manner of some is
[2:37:10] in a message. What a v what visions are.
[2:37:14] He said we feel that every person is
[2:37:17] duty bound to attend some church.
[2:37:22] You belong to some church as a
[2:37:24] Christian.
[2:37:26] Many people say, "Oh, I stay home
[2:37:29] and read my Bible.
[2:37:32] I'm just as well off." No. The Bible
[2:37:36] said we should not forsake to assemble
[2:37:40] ourselves together.
[2:37:42] We've got to do that. We've got to stand
[2:37:46] together. And all the churches,
[2:37:51] can we say amen? Let me tell you, I
[2:37:55] understood here that in Uganda
[2:37:58] that you people are afraid of rain.
[2:38:01] Can we say amen?
[2:38:03] But let me tell you, you as a believer,
[2:38:06] don't let the rain stop you
[2:38:09] from coming to a church. That is a
[2:38:12] sacrifice.
[2:38:13] That is a sacrifice. When God see your
[2:38:16] sacrifice, God will bless you.
[2:38:21] Years ago, I told some people,
[2:38:25] you know, in where it was raining so
[2:38:27] much, I told her, I said, brothers, if
[2:38:30] you are if it's raining,
[2:38:33] if you have a bag or plastic bag or
[2:38:35] something, put another clothes there.
[2:38:39] If you have to walk in the rain, walk in
[2:38:42] the rain. When you go to church, change
[2:38:45] your clothing and worship God.
[2:38:49] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[2:38:52] Lord. We must show God that we are
[2:38:54] serious about the things of God. Blessed
[2:38:58] be the name of the Lord. If it is a
[2:39:00] spirit in the nation,
[2:39:03] if that is the spirit that is ruling the
[2:39:04] nation, it should not rule you.
[2:39:07] Hallelujah. You are Christians. Overcome
[2:39:10] that spirit.
[2:39:14] Don't say well I will stay home and and
[2:39:16] and watch and watch and watch. You know
[2:39:18] we have online services.
[2:39:22] Can we say amen? God said don't forsake.
[2:39:26] Don't forake to assemble yourself.
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:39:36] Amen.
[2:39:42] Amen.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:48] I said when you see a person that
[2:39:49] struggles in giving tithe and offering
[2:39:51] there's their spiritual condition is not
[2:39:53] good
[2:40:01] when we give God
[2:40:04] how do we give God
[2:40:09] you see
[2:40:13] brother Benham said,
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; "God deserve our best."
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; In Malachi 1:6,
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; God was closing the Old Testament with a
[2:40:32] complaint.
[2:40:36] He say, "A son honorth his father."
[2:40:40] A son honors his father. Malachi 16.
[2:40:47] A son honorth his father
[2:40:50] and a servant is master.
[2:40:53] If I if then I be a father,
[2:40:56] where is mine honor?
[2:41:01] If I be a master,
[2:41:04] where is my fear? Say the Lord of hosts
[2:41:07] unto you. Oh priests that despise thy
[2:41:11] name.
[2:41:13] And you say wherein have we despised thy
[2:41:15] name?
[2:41:19] God was making a complaint.
[2:41:22] He said you people have despised me.
[2:41:27] You don't honor me.
[2:41:30] You don't fear me.
[2:41:32] You say you ask how did did we despise
[2:41:36] your name?
[2:41:38] Let's look at verse seven. He say you
[2:41:41] offer polluted bread upon mine altar.
[2:41:49] You say wherein have you polluted thee?
[2:41:53] You say the table of the Lord is
[2:41:56] contemptable.
[2:42:02] Hallelujah. To despise is to hold in
[2:42:05] contempt.
[2:42:07] To be contemptable is to despise.
[2:42:12] So they were given offerings.
[2:42:15] All was complaining of the offerings
[2:42:16] that they were given.
[2:42:19] Can we say amen? They were given their
[2:42:22] offerings
[2:42:23] but they were bringing polluted bread.
[2:42:26] Brother said God deserve your best.
[2:42:38] Sometimes even when we want to give
[2:42:41] offering,
[2:42:42] we look among the dirty money, the one
[2:42:45] that is dirty.
[2:42:47] That is why we give to God.
[2:42:56] He said you offering polluted bread upon
[2:42:58] my altar.
[2:43:01] If you offer the blind for sacrifice,
[2:43:06] is it not evil?
[2:43:09] If you offer the lame and the sick,
[2:43:12] is it not evil? You offer it now to your
[2:43:16] governor,
[2:43:18] will he be pleased with thee?
[2:43:22] Or accept thy person, say the Lord of
[2:43:24] hosts.
[2:43:33] Amen.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; Though they were given offerings,
[2:43:38] when a man will go among his sheep,
[2:43:43] he knows he's supposed to bring
[2:43:44] offering.
[2:43:46] He will take the one that is lame.
[2:43:50] The weak one, the one that is not of a
[2:43:53] value, that's the one that he will take.
[2:43:57] and bring to a church for offering
[2:44:00] or he take a lamb that is blind
[2:44:03] and he take that and use that to offer
[2:44:05] it to God for offering.
[2:44:08] God was very angry. God was not happy
[2:44:11] with that. He said you are giving me an
[2:44:14] offering like that.
[2:44:16] Can you give your governor such an
[2:44:17] offering?
[2:44:21] You are in contempt.
[2:44:25] God held them in contempt.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; When we are coming to church, brother
[2:44:41] say come to church in your best.
[2:44:49] Sometimes
[2:44:51] we just limit it to clothing.
[2:44:55] That's good. We should dress well
[2:44:58] and come to church.
[2:44:59] But you see, it's beyond that.
[2:45:03] When you are coming to church, you must
[2:45:05] come in your best. You must be in your
[2:45:08] right frame of mind.
[2:45:12] Can we say amen? You don't come to
[2:45:14] church and you are sleeping in church.
[2:45:19] You are not in your best. You're not
[2:45:21] giving God your best. You don't come to
[2:45:24] church. The pastor is preaching and your
[2:45:27] mind is wearing.
[2:45:31] Praise the name of the Lord. You are
[2:45:33] coming to church. You are thinking about
[2:45:35] food. You are coming to church. You are
[2:45:38] thinking about your job. Can we say
[2:45:40] amen?
[2:45:43] We should come to church in our best.
[2:45:46] Present yourself.
[2:45:48] Present yourself as a living sacrifice.
[2:45:55] Hallelujah.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; When we come in our best,
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; when we offer God the best praises,
[2:46:02] the best songs, can we say amen? That is
[2:46:06] why. May God help us not to bring the
[2:46:10] denominational way of worship.
[2:46:13] There's a way we should worship God.
[2:46:16] There's a way we should play the trumps.
[2:46:19] There's a way we should play the
[2:46:20] instruments. It must be acceptable.
[2:46:24] Can we say amen? Don't put a rock and
[2:46:27] roll beat.
[2:46:30] May God help us. May God help us. May
[2:46:34] God give us grace. Those that worship
[2:46:37] God must worship him in spirit and in
[2:46:42] truth.
[2:46:56] So they will go to their farms
[2:46:59] and say this one is not good. That's
[2:47:01] what I'm going to give to church.
[2:47:04] God is saying if you offer the blind
[2:47:09] to your governor, is it not evil?
[2:47:16] Will your governor be pleased?
[2:47:25] May God help us.
[2:47:29] God is taking a sacrifice brought by a
[2:47:33] person.
[2:47:36] God is looking at an offering that
[2:47:38] somebody brought to church
[2:47:42] and he's judging it for evil or for
[2:47:45] good.
[2:47:51] As a man thinkketh in his heart,
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; so he
[2:48:00] may God help us.
[2:48:03] Brother Bham said this.
[2:48:06] He said is worthy of the best.
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; What do you do for him?
[2:48:14] Give him the leftover.
[2:48:21] I tell my people all the time,
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; when you know that tomorrow is Sunday,
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; go to bed early.
[2:48:32] Rest your body well.
[2:48:35] Hallelujah. So that you can come to
[2:48:37] church in your best.
[2:48:41] Do you know that said you can prostitute
[2:48:44] your time
[2:48:50] all night you are online
[2:48:54] in China you're in India you're over
[2:48:57] here and over there from website to
[2:49:00] website to website
[2:49:03] you don't sleep you sleep for two hours
[2:49:06] you've given your time so the internet
[2:49:09] You come to church. You come to church
[2:49:12] very tired. You come to church. You are
[2:49:15] sleeping. You are giving God your
[2:49:18] leftover.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Oh yes. You can run around all
[2:49:32] day.
[2:49:34] Give him 3 minutes at night before you
[2:49:37] go to bed.
[2:49:41] Some of us don't even have a prayer
[2:49:42] life.
[2:49:44] Can we say amen? For the church to go
[2:49:47] on, for the church to overcome,
[2:49:51] you need a people that are praying.
[2:49:54] Can we say amen? We fight our battles on
[2:49:57] our knees.
[2:49:59] When we are praying, Amen. He moves
[2:50:03] heaven.
[2:50:04] When Daniel was praying,
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; can we say amen? Daniel was praying.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The day he started praying, that
[2:50:13] they started praying,
[2:50:16] God sent angel Gabriel.
[2:50:19] There are there are demons.
[2:50:23] There are powers that are ruling over
[2:50:26] cities.
[2:50:29] There are demons that are ruling over
[2:50:32] villages.
[2:50:33] There are spirits, hallelujah, amen,
[2:50:36] unseen forces.
[2:50:38] But when you go on your knees, he begin
[2:50:41] to make an offering of prayer.
[2:50:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; Heaven begin to move.
[2:50:48] God begin to dispatch angels.
[2:50:52] Can we say amen? God begin to do greater
[2:50:54] things.
[2:50:56] May God help us. We should have time to
[2:50:59] pray.
[2:51:01] Have a prayer life.
[2:51:03] Have a prayer life. Have a time set
[2:51:06] aside.
[2:51:08] God, I'm going to give you this x amount
[2:51:11] of time every day as an offering.
[2:51:16] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[2:51:18] Lord. Things will begin to change.
[2:51:22] Miracles will happen. The supernatural
[2:51:25] will begin to move.
[2:51:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord. When
[2:51:29] you hear the word, when you hear the
[2:51:32] word, when you go home,
[2:51:35] find some time to pray.
[2:51:38] Can you say amen? Oh Lord, help me
[2:51:42] Jesus. Help me this area. Pray for your
[2:51:46] pastor. Pray for the officers. Pray for
[2:51:49] the ministers. Pray for the church.
[2:51:53] Hallelujah.
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; Offer your prayers.
[2:51:56] God is looking for prayer warriors.
[2:51:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:00] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; Today we become lazy Christians.
[2:52:11] It wasn't so from the beginning.
[2:52:14] It doesn't matter where you are. It
[2:52:16] doesn't matter where you are. Daniel was
[2:52:18] in Babylon.
[2:52:20] Some of you maybe came from the village.
[2:52:23] He came to Campala.
[2:52:25] Can we say amen? There are demons that
[2:52:28] are ruling campala.
[2:52:30] Remember you are a Christian.
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; You must be above.
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; Prophet said he deserves your best.
[2:52:52] He deserves everything you got.
[2:52:56] But what do you do about it? You give
[2:52:59] him just anything.
[2:53:02] Prophet said, he takes it. He takes it
[2:53:05] anyhow.
[2:53:07] He takes it.
[2:53:09] This woman,
[2:53:11] this woman who was a prostitute
[2:53:14] that went saw Jesus, they have invited
[2:53:18] him. They never worship you. They never
[2:53:22] they never wash his feet. When the woman
[2:53:26] observed that
[2:53:29] she ran to the shop
[2:53:31] and she went when when she went to the
[2:53:33] shopkeeper,
[2:53:35] she says, "Sir, give me the best
[2:53:39] of your oint your your your perfume."
[2:53:43] It was a very expensive perfume.
[2:53:47] Can we say amen? She bought that and
[2:53:50] came to Jesus.
[2:53:52] And when she came to Jesus, she begin to
[2:53:55] weep and took her long hair,
[2:53:59] wiped the feet of Jesus and anointed
[2:54:03] Jesus
[2:54:04] with her expensive perfume.
[2:54:07] Can you say amen? because of our action,
[2:54:12] because of her offering
[2:54:14] that gave her eternal life, it gave her
[2:54:17] eternal life.
[2:54:19] Jesus said, "Wherever this gospel,
[2:54:23] because of what you did, because of your
[2:54:27] offering, because of the way you treated
[2:54:29] me, because of your gift, wherever this
[2:54:33] gospel is preached, your name will be
[2:54:38] mentioned. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:54:50] I'm sad.
[2:54:54] &gt;&gt; Give your best
[2:54:58] to give him your best. Give him the best
[2:55:01] of your life.
[2:55:09] Remember now
[2:55:12] your creator
[2:55:16] days of your youth.
[2:55:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Young
[2:55:22] sisters,
[2:55:24] don't allow any serpent seed
[2:55:29] to defy you.
[2:55:33] Don't sell yourself
[2:55:36] because of money.
[2:55:40] young man. You may be in an office where
[2:55:44] maybe your manager or supervisor is a
[2:55:46] lady
[2:55:48] because of the anointing upon you.
[2:55:51] The devil want to take that anointing
[2:55:54] and begin to entice you.
[2:55:57] Praise the name of the Lord. Stand like
[2:55:59] Joseph. Stand like Joseph. Blessed be
[2:56:02] the name of the Lord. Stand for God.
[2:56:12] Give him the best of your life.
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; Most of you are young people.
[2:56:19] Can you say amen? You have strength. You
[2:56:22] have energy. Give that strength to the
[2:56:26] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:56:29] Give your time to reading and praying.
[2:56:35] Stop looking at nude women on the
[2:56:38] internet.
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; You're here feeding your spirit
[2:56:48] on naked women, feeding your spirit on
[2:56:52] dirty things and you come to church on
[2:56:55] Sunday and you raise your hand.
[2:56:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:56:59] &gt;&gt; That's hypocrisy.
[2:57:01] Can I say amen?
[2:57:02] &gt;&gt; Present yourself.
[2:57:05] as a living sacrifice,
[2:57:08] &gt;&gt; holy and acceptable.
[2:57:15] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. May God
[2:57:17] help us. May the Lord help us. May the
[2:57:21] Lord give us grace.
[2:57:25] Give him your best. Give him the best of
[2:57:28] your life.
[2:57:32] You will never regret.
[2:57:35] serving the Lord.
[2:57:37] Hallelujah.
[2:57:39] God will owe no man anything
[2:57:44] is a rewarder.
[2:57:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; He said not even given a cup of cold
[2:57:51] water
[2:57:55] will go unrewarded.
[2:57:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In every age he say I know
[2:58:03] your works.
[2:58:07] May God help us. If we take that
[2:58:10] attitude,
[2:58:13] God will begin to do supernatural
[2:58:14] things. The blessings of God will come
[2:58:18] over your life. The blessings of God
[2:58:22] will come over your children. The
[2:58:24] blessings of God, the protection of God.
[2:58:28] Can you say amen? Hallelujah.
[2:58:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; Melchisedc
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; called Abraham.
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am your shield.
[2:58:37] &gt;&gt; I am your shield. Any exceeding great
[2:58:40] reward,
[2:58:42] God will be your protection."
[2:58:45] Can we say, "Amen. Though I walk through
[2:58:47] the valley of shadow of death, I will
[2:58:51] fear no evil, for thou art with me."
[2:58:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:58:58] Give your life,
[2:59:00] &gt;&gt; give your strength, give your money,
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; give your soul, give your spirit as an
[2:59:07] offering to the almighty God. God is
[2:59:11] looking for young men. God is looking
[2:59:14] for young women. Hallelujah. That will
[2:59:17] serve him that will serve him with all
[2:59:21] of their heart.
[2:59:27] Hallelujah.
[2:59:30] &gt;&gt; Abraham said
[2:59:32] she poured the oil upon his feet
[2:59:37] and the whole the whole room lit up with
[2:59:40] it.
[2:59:43] It was costly.
[2:59:47] He said there is nothing too good for
[2:59:49] Jesus.
[2:59:56] There is nothing too good for Jesus.
[3:00:00] Give him your best.
[3:00:02] Give him everything you got.
[3:00:06] Your life, your soul, your being, your
[3:00:10] time, all that you have. Give him to
[3:00:14] him. Give it to him.
[3:00:17] Don't say the prophet.
[3:00:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[3:00:29] &gt;&gt; God delights in a cheerful giver.
[3:00:35] Brother Benham said
[3:00:39] when she went to that man who was
[3:00:41] selling,
[3:00:44] she said, "Kind sir,
[3:00:47] I I want the best alabaster box you got
[3:00:49] in the store.
[3:00:54] I want not one, but I want the best you
[3:00:58] got.
[3:01:01] The way
[3:01:03] your best.
[3:01:05] He deserves your best. The best you got.
[3:01:10] He said we give him the seconds.
[3:01:13] We give him the last.
[3:01:17] Do you know the Bible says, "Seek ye
[3:01:21] first the kingdom of God."
[3:01:25] &gt;&gt; God must be first
[3:01:30] in everything.
[3:01:33] When you with when you get your
[3:01:35] paycheck,
[3:01:38] the first thing
[3:01:41] that is supposed to come out of your
[3:01:43] check
[3:01:46] is your tithe.
[3:01:49] That's right.
[3:01:53] After you give your tithe,
[3:01:57] I have given too much
[3:02:01] there are free will offerings.
[3:02:08] Look,
[3:02:10] if a man makes a farm,
[3:02:14] and just plant seeds from here to here.
[3:02:21] How much would he expect
[3:02:26] when harvest come
[3:02:30] as opposed to somebody
[3:02:33] who will sow seed all over the place?
[3:02:40] The more you give, the more God blesses
[3:02:43] you.
[3:02:45] The more you get out of the harvest.
[3:02:51] May God help us.
[3:02:54] Brother Benham said,
[3:02:56] &gt;&gt; he loved brother Benham.
[3:02:59] &gt;&gt; We love the prophet.
[3:03:02] He said, "You take your first,
[3:03:06] go out and spend
[3:03:10] and have big times."
[3:03:14] And then when you go to church on Sunday
[3:03:16] morning,
[3:03:18] you give him a quarter.
[3:03:22] But you go out
[3:03:26] $50 present
[3:03:29] to give to the Joneses
[3:03:32] that live next door to you
[3:03:37] or something enough
[3:03:39] or something enough
[3:03:42] to get up in your society. right
[3:03:47] to give Jesus the last.
[3:03:50] He deserves your best.
[3:03:54] Amen.
[3:03:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus deserves everything that you are
[3:04:00] and all that you got. That's the reason
[3:04:03] we can't get nowhere.
[3:04:12] When you never had a car,
[3:04:16] oh God, bless me with a car.
[3:04:19] Lord, if you bless me, I will use it for
[3:04:22] the work of God.
[3:04:25] God will answer your prayer.
[3:04:28] He gives you the car.
[3:04:30] You watch what you will do.
[3:04:33] The Bible says, "Don't be hasty to
[3:04:35] speak.
[3:04:38] You make a vow.
[3:04:40] Pay your vows.
[3:04:46] &gt;&gt; God has given a vehicle.
[3:04:52] The pastor says
[3:04:56] go.
[3:05:00] Can you go and pick that sister or that
[3:05:03] brother?
[3:05:08] Now
[3:05:13] the road is too bad.
[3:05:19] You're looking at the gas.
[3:05:22] You are looking at your vehicle.
[3:05:25] The vehicle has become an idol.
[3:05:35] You see your brothers passing along the
[3:05:37] road.
[3:05:41] &gt;&gt; Your church brother, you act as if you
[3:05:43] don't see them.
[3:05:49] May God help us.
[3:05:52] Prophet of God said, everything that you
[3:05:55] got,
[3:05:56] give it to him.
[3:06:00] He said this is the reason we can't go
[3:06:02] nowhere.
[3:06:11] Yeah.
[3:06:13] God gave you a nice home
[3:06:17] when the people come for the meetings
[3:06:20] and they say go and just can can you
[3:06:22] keep some brothers
[3:06:26] especially when he come from the
[3:06:28] village.
[3:06:31] Yeah,
[3:06:33] these villagers.
[3:06:39] &gt;&gt; But you forgot where you came from.
[3:06:44] &gt;&gt; We need to change our attitude.
[3:06:51] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[3:06:57] I've seen also that
[3:07:01] it's a problem all over.
[3:07:04] Sometimes
[3:07:05] when it comes to offering,
[3:07:08] people give little
[3:07:14] sometimes you see people give $1 or one
[3:07:17] sheet.
[3:07:23] They come to church. There's money
[3:07:24] there.
[3:07:27] When they taking the offering,
[3:07:30] they look for the little note.
[3:07:38] How do you expect God to bless you?
[3:07:45] God was telling them, "What are you
[3:07:48] thinking about me?
[3:07:51] Look at the kind of offerings
[3:07:55] I hope by the time I I come next time,
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; I will hear good testimonies.
[3:08:01] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:08:08] Do you do you love the Lord today?
[3:08:12] &gt;&gt; May the name of the Lord be praised.
[3:08:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. May God help us.
[3:08:21] &gt;&gt; Now
[3:08:24] coming to church
[3:08:27] is an offering
[3:08:30] is a service.
[3:08:34] There are people
[3:08:37] who have just made up their minds.
[3:08:41] Is not only here but you find that
[3:08:44] problem everywhere.
[3:08:49] that they will only come to church on
[3:08:51] Sunday.
[3:08:57] All right. Sometimes
[3:08:59] there are circumstances.
[3:09:03] But serving God is a sacrifice.
[3:09:09] Some don't live far from church
[3:09:13] yet they make excuses.
[3:09:19] When the brethren are praying,
[3:09:22] what are you doing at home?
[3:09:27] &gt;&gt; On the internet.
[3:09:33] Praise the Lord. May God help us. Let's
[3:09:37] serve God with everything that is in us.
[3:09:40] He deserve your worship.
[3:09:43] He deserve your life.
[3:09:45] He deserve hallelujah.
[3:09:48] &gt;&gt; Let the devil know that we are the
[3:09:51] people of God. We are here to worship
[3:09:53] God.
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; If you don't worship God,
[3:09:59] you worship something.
[3:10:08] May God help us.
[3:10:16] &gt;&gt; God
[3:10:18] deserve
[3:10:20] your best.
[3:10:23] God deserve the best of your time, the
[3:10:28] best of your money, the best of
[3:10:31] everything,
[3:10:38] if you apply those laws.
[3:10:43] Sometimes
[3:10:45] you see people that apply the laws of
[3:10:47] God
[3:10:49] and God begin to bless them.
[3:10:53] Some people in the church become jealous
[3:11:01] the spirit of jealousy
[3:11:04] &gt;&gt; is the spirit of king.
[3:11:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:11:11] &gt;&gt; God told Ken,
[3:11:14] "See what your brother Abel have done.
[3:11:18] Why can't you do the same thing?
[3:11:24] Amen.
[3:11:25] &gt;&gt; If you do the right thing,
[3:11:27] &gt;&gt; God will do nothing but bless you.
[3:11:34] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[3:11:36] &gt;&gt; May God give us grace.
[3:11:38] God bless you.
[3:11:42] Amen.
[3:11:45] Hallelujah. God bless you.
[3:11:50] Amen. Oh god.
[3:11:55] Amen.
[3:11:58] Amen.
[3:12:00] Amen. How many have been blessed
[3:12:02] tonight?
[3:12:04] Amen. I believe every one of us has been
[3:12:06] blessed.
[3:12:08] You know, we I can rehearse everything
[3:12:10] that the pastor said.
[3:12:12] Something that I uh you know, one or two
[3:12:14] things that I just want to just rehearse
[3:12:17] to you tonight.
[3:12:19] See, salvation is free.
[3:12:22] Blessings are conditional.
[3:12:26] Did you hear that? Salvation is free.
[3:12:31] Blessings are
[3:12:35] so you can be saved. You can be a good
[3:12:37] believer but struggling in your life.
[3:12:43] But all because you've not met God's
[3:12:46] conditions.
[3:12:50] Amen. Recently, I'm I've met several
[3:12:53] very many brethren
[3:12:56] and the pastor said that many times when
[3:12:59] someone is backsliding,
[3:13:03] one of the first thing that you see
[3:13:06] is that the the area of their giving
[3:13:10] goes down.
[3:13:12] They no longer come to church as they
[3:13:14] used to.
[3:13:16] They no longer want to sing as they used
[3:13:18] to.
[3:13:20] They now sit in the back. When the song
[3:13:23] leader says, "Let's clap our hands."
[3:13:25] It's a clap offering.
[3:13:28] They don't want to give that. They don't
[3:13:30] want to sing. Every time is you for you.
[3:13:33] The key is wrong.
[3:13:37] The key is wrong.
[3:13:39] You know, you find that they don't want
[3:13:41] to give offerings.
[3:13:44] You know, some of of some of you have
[3:13:45] pledged
[3:13:47] and you've completely done nothing on
[3:13:48] your behalf.
[3:13:51] I have people here, young people that
[3:13:53] have given pledges.
[3:13:55] Some of them are about to finish their
[3:13:56] pledge.
[3:13:58] And you find others who would have given
[3:14:00] more.
[3:14:02] It's not priority.
[3:14:06] But I think after this service,
[3:14:08] things are going to change.
[3:14:11] Amen. what we had yesterday and what we
[3:14:14] had this morning.
[3:14:16] You see, and these things are not his
[3:14:18] ideas.
[3:14:20] He read these quotes for us on Wednesday
[3:14:22] in the reproach for the cause of of the
[3:14:24] word says God made a promise that he
[3:14:28] would bless.
[3:14:30] Amen. Tell your neighbor, God made a
[3:14:32] promise
[3:14:33] that he would bless.
[3:14:35] But now listen to this. But them
[3:14:37] blessings
[3:14:39] are under condition.
[3:14:42] And you have got to meet those
[3:14:43] conditions
[3:14:46] to make that work.
[3:14:50] In the influence, he says all promises
[3:14:53] of God are true,
[3:14:55] but they are unconditional.
[3:14:57] No matter how much how fundamentally
[3:15:00] right we are,
[3:15:02] we've got to approach it the right way.
[3:15:07] Now, men can be fundamentally right.
[3:15:12] and still not receive the blessings of
[3:15:13] God
[3:15:15] because they're good believers but they
[3:15:18] not
[3:15:20] because it's approached because it's
[3:15:23] approached in the wrong way.
[3:15:28] It goes upon conditions.
[3:15:32] We've seen those who are not even
[3:15:33] believing this message.
[3:15:36] They apply these principles
[3:15:39] and God blesses them.
[3:15:42] Let's apply the principles.
[3:15:44] We are believing the message and we
[3:15:46] applying these principles to meet the
[3:15:49] conditions of God.
[3:15:52] God will send blessings out.
[3:15:55] So if your business is is suffering,
[3:15:59] please praying is good is a part of
[3:16:02] giving
[3:16:04] but give your time. Come to church on
[3:16:09] Wednesday. It's a sacrifice.
[3:16:13] Close your your your your business and
[3:16:16] come to church. It's only two hours here
[3:16:20] plus one hour of traveling. Three hours.
[3:16:24] people who know their God will do that.
[3:16:27] May God, Amen, bring us to that level of
[3:16:30] revelation.
[3:16:32] You see, I've I've seen uh brethren that
[3:16:36] have caught that revelation and God
[3:16:38] always blesses you. But you see, you may
[3:16:42] stay at your business, you will not
[3:16:44] close and customers will not come
[3:16:48] and then you will call the pastor to
[3:16:50] pray for you.
[3:16:52] But you are sowing the wrong seed.
[3:16:55] and reaping the wrong harvest. Sow the
[3:16:57] right seed and you will reap the right
[3:16:59] harvest.
[3:17:01] The Muslims no matter whether and you
[3:17:04] you know they they usually busy at their
[3:17:06] place of work
[3:17:09] but when it is time for prayer
[3:17:12] they don't care how many people are
[3:17:13] lining up
[3:17:16] to them priority
[3:17:20] their God you will find him the man is
[3:17:22] there kneeling down and praying
[3:17:26] one time before I knew what they do I
[3:17:29] went to one of their shops
[3:17:32] said, "Yes,
[3:17:37] and I did not I was young. I did not
[3:17:39] know that the man was praying.
[3:17:42] I thought he must come and sell to
[3:17:43] meep."
[3:17:46] He didn't mind about it. He doesn't even
[3:17:49] care whether someone steals
[3:17:52] or anything, whether he's losing money.
[3:17:55] The only thing he's caring about is now
[3:17:58] it's time for prayer.
[3:18:00] But the Christians
[3:18:03] &gt;&gt; when it's time for work
[3:18:06] &gt;&gt; service I will go on Sunday
[3:18:10] even on Sunday they will come late
[3:18:13] they will work until very late on
[3:18:15] Saturday
[3:18:18] and go at home there's a lot of things
[3:18:19] to do you are too tired then you come
[3:18:22] here Sunday morning too tired the pastor
[3:18:25] is preaching but everything is going
[3:18:27] over your
[3:18:29] God has spoken to us.
[3:18:32] May we take what we have been, what we
[3:18:35] have heard. Total obedience
[3:18:38] will lead you to possession.
[3:18:41] You know, I love the way the pastor
[3:18:43] talks about a rich young ruler.
[3:18:47] You know, he could not possess life
[3:18:51] because he never totally obeyed.
[3:18:56] When he came to Jesus, he told him,
[3:18:59] "Good master,
[3:19:01] what can I do to inherit eternal life?"
[3:19:03] And Jesus answered him, and this always
[3:19:05] moves me. He answered him and he said,
[3:19:08] "Why do you call me good?
[3:19:12] Only God."
[3:19:15] In other words, you must know that you
[3:19:18] have come to me.
[3:19:20] You must know that I am God.
[3:19:23] And the scripture says, "All that come
[3:19:26] to God,
[3:19:27] all that come to God must know that he
[3:19:30] is
[3:19:32] and is a reward
[3:19:35] for those that diligently seek."
[3:19:37] This man came seeking after you, but he
[3:19:40] never came willing and ready to obey.
[3:19:45] He never obeyed and he lost life. He
[3:19:48] could not possess it.
[3:19:51] When you come to a total obedience,
[3:19:55] then you can have possession.
[3:19:58] But until you totally obey,
[3:20:01] you've got to completely surrender your
[3:20:03] own thoughts,
[3:20:06] your own will,
[3:20:09] your own mind,
[3:20:11] and let the mind of Christ operate in
[3:20:14] you.
[3:20:17] Do you think Christ would the mind of
[3:20:19] Christ in you would say the days of
[3:20:21] miracles is passed or do you think the
[3:20:22] mind of Christ in you would say the
[3:20:24] Bible is right in some places and not in
[3:20:26] others?
[3:20:31] The mind of Christ would sanction every
[3:20:35] word
[3:20:37] that Christ ever said. How many say amen
[3:20:40] to that?
[3:20:42] So don't use your own mind.
[3:20:45] Use the mind of Christ. How many say
[3:20:48] that what we have heard this morning is
[3:20:49] the mind of Christ.
[3:20:53] Amen. God deserves our best.
[3:20:56] I'm leaving this service this Sunday
[3:20:57] morning.
[3:20:59] Resolve to give God my best.
[3:21:04] My best worship.
[3:21:06] My best dressing when I come to church.
[3:21:10] It's not pride, friends. It is giving
[3:21:12] God your best.
[3:21:15] my best time.
[3:21:17] My best giving
[3:21:19] I want to be the best financial giver,
[3:21:22] supporter to the church,
[3:21:25] to the work of the ministry.
[3:21:28] My best singing.
[3:21:30] Praise God.
[3:21:32] And we have a testimony here
[3:21:35] from one of the brothers here.
[3:21:38] Amen. The hand of the Lord is uh in our
[3:21:40] lives.
[3:21:42] A testimony from brother Allan
[3:21:45] and gratitude to the leadership of the
[3:21:47] saints
[3:21:49] to the to the leadership and the saints
[3:21:52] of the living God for the prayers and
[3:21:53] support.
[3:21:55] Praise the Lord saints of the living
[3:21:57] God. Amen. He says, "Praise the Lord.
[3:22:01] I want to thank the Lord Jesus for his
[3:22:03] faithfulness.
[3:22:05] After a long time of waiting and prayer,
[3:22:09] the Lord has answered us.
[3:22:12] The pastor said he will always answer.
[3:22:15] If you pray, he always answers.
[3:22:19] But after he has answered, you don't
[3:22:21] have to forget him.
[3:22:24] What we have today is something friends.
[3:22:27] So this is a testimony. He has answered
[3:22:29] us and blessed me him with a job.
[3:22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:22:41] My dear wife and I truly saw the hand of
[3:22:43] God.
[3:22:45] He passed us through when the way seemed
[3:22:47] closed.
[3:22:50] We also sincerely thank the saints of
[3:22:52] the living God and the leadership for
[3:22:53] the favven prayers
[3:22:57] and support offered on our behalf.
[3:23:00] Truly those prayers were not in vain.
[3:23:03] We have availed much in our lives.
[3:23:06] To everyone who stood with us during the
[3:23:08] waiting season,
[3:23:10] encouraged us and prayed for us. May the
[3:23:13] Lord richly bless you. We give him all
[3:23:15] the glory, honor, and praise.
[3:23:18] Amen. Amen.
[3:23:21] Amen. And to some of you who are also
[3:23:23] still waiting,
[3:23:26] maybe you're in a waiting season,
[3:23:28] I say he will come through for you.
[3:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:34] Quite frankly, I believe that as
[3:23:35] believers,
[3:23:38] we should not struggle
[3:23:40] to get what to eat.
[3:23:43] We should not struggle get transport to
[3:23:45] church.
[3:23:47] We should not struggle to get clothes.
[3:23:50] We should not struggle to pay our school
[3:23:53] fees. Those things should not be a
[3:23:55] struggle because those are needs. He
[3:23:58] promised to give to provide all our
[3:24:00] needs.
[3:24:02] according to his riches in glory.
[3:24:06] But there are principles
[3:24:10] and if this church
[3:24:13] and one thing that I I heard also the
[3:24:14] pastor say
[3:24:16] it doesn't matter where you are.
[3:24:19] This principle applies everywhere.
[3:24:23] In the village,
[3:24:25] in the city, in America where the pastor
[3:24:29] comes from, in Uganda,
[3:24:33] it applies
[3:24:35] the same principle. Practice it in your
[3:24:38] life. Practice it in your family and you
[3:24:42] will watch the blessing of God.
[3:24:45] Can I have an amen on that?
[3:24:48] Amen.
[3:24:49] Let us stand on our feet.
[3:24:52] Just try to close the service. We have
[3:24:54] another service this afternoon
[3:24:58] at over at Pastor Bima.
[3:25:02] And so all those that can make it this
[3:25:05] afternoon,
[3:25:07] you're welcome to do it.
[3:25:09] Uh I also don't know the directions very
[3:25:12] well.
[3:25:13] I've been there years ago.
[3:25:16] &gt;&gt; I think you've been there recently.
[3:25:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you give the people
[3:25:19] directions?
[3:25:32] International.
[3:25:55] Amen. Amen.
[3:25:56] &gt;&gt; Have we understood?
[3:26:03] All right. So, God bless you. We're
[3:26:04] going to be there, I think, from around
[3:26:07] 300 p.m. or 2:04, something like that.
[3:26:12] &gt;&gt; And that would be the last service for
[3:26:15] uh uh Pastor Simon
[3:26:18] and afterwards he will travel back to
[3:26:20] New York
[3:26:23] tomorrow.
[3:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh
[3:26:34] Amen.
[3:26:49] So
[3:27:19] Majesty Majesty
[3:27:22] come and help me. Let us sing this as we
[3:27:25] we just uh uh give and uh we'll have
[3:27:29] brother we'll have you brother Baka come
[3:27:31] and pray for us shortly.
[3:27:34] Amen. Otherwise I just want all of us to
[3:27:37] say together to pastor Simon tell him
[3:27:40] raise up your hand and say God bless
[3:27:42] you.
[3:27:43] God bless you. Tell him thank you for
[3:27:46] coming. Thank you.
[3:27:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming.
[3:27:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Your your Amen. Let us
[3:27:51] sing your grace. Your grace. Your grace
[3:27:55] has found me just as I am.
[3:27:59] Ooh.
[3:28:01] Emptyhanded
[3:28:03] but alive in your hand.
[3:28:10] Your grace has found me just as I am.
[3:28:19] Empty and dead, but alive in your hand.
[3:28:26] Forever.
[3:28:29] Forever.
[3:28:30] I am changed by your love.
[3:28:35] In the presence

[3:30:42] Majesty,
[3:30:53] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord. Hallelujah.
[3:31:06] I a prayer.
[3:31:08] Heavenly Father, King of glory, we thank
[3:31:11] you for this morning. We thank you,
[3:31:14] Lord, for the gift of life you've given
[3:31:16] us as a church.
[3:31:18] We thank you Lord for the minister that
[3:31:21] you brought to us far from you Jesus.
[3:31:25] We thank you Lord for your ways for your
[3:31:27] ways and not the ways of man.
[3:31:31] Father King of God for we have heard
[3:31:32] your word and we pray that let that seed
[3:31:36] that has been swed in us today germinate
[3:31:39] and Lord that that word will bear fruits
[3:31:42] and father that the fruits will be
[3:31:44] faithful.
[3:31:46] The fruit father king of glor shall be
[3:31:49] onto us. Father king of glory shall help
[3:31:52] us and help the church to grow. Lord
[3:31:54] Jesus we thank you Lord for you have
[3:31:58] brought your word today. Father king of
[3:32:00] glory I can't forget yesterday when I
[3:32:03] was praying. I pray that Lord for
[3:32:05] everyone who have questions that Lord
[3:32:09] you provide answers for Lord I believe
[3:32:11] in this congregation there are people
[3:32:13] who have been having questions about
[3:32:15] their financial stability.
[3:32:18] I'm sure Lord that you have answered our
[3:32:21] questions.
[3:32:22] &gt;&gt; I have no doubt in that Lord. Lord when
[3:32:26] we called you father king of glor you
[3:32:28] have answered the prayer. And those who
[3:32:31] go by what you have told us, I have no
[3:32:34] doubt that you will answer their
[3:32:36] prayers.
[3:32:38] &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, as we are leaving this
[3:32:40] place, pray that Lord, you come and go
[3:32:42] with us. Go with us to our places of
[3:32:45] abboard. But Father, you even keep us
[3:32:48] where we stay. Those who are traveling,
[3:32:51] Father, King of God, I pray for Jesus.
[3:32:54] Lord, as we're ushering into a new year,
[3:32:57] may you be with us, Lord Jesus. Let no
[3:33:00] one of us, Father King fail to enter in
[3:33:03] a new year, be with us, Lord, in our
[3:33:06] families. Father, I remember my wife who
[3:33:08] is sick at home. I pray Lord for a
[3:33:11] healing. Father, even if there's anyone
[3:33:14] in this congregation who is not feeling
[3:33:17] well and is sick, demanding for healing,
[3:33:20] may you grant it, Lord, for by your
[3:33:23] stripes we are healed. We pray all this
[3:33:26] believing in the name of our Lord Jesus
[3:33:28] Christ. Amen.
[3:33:36] I tell you saints before we dismiss
[3:33:39] uh there probably some of you who have
[3:33:42] been going through I know I know not
[3:33:44] probably but I know going through
[3:33:46] situations
[3:33:48] and maybe you feel that you are in a
[3:33:49] very sorry state
[3:33:52] you need help
[3:33:54] the answer like brother Andrew prayed
[3:33:56] the answer from the mind of God
[3:34:00] is that give
[3:34:02] &gt;&gt; and it shall be given to
[3:34:04] And giving is not only money.
[3:34:07] We've had all the giving.
[3:34:10] Maybe you want to go back and listen to
[3:34:11] this first the Wednesday service,
[3:34:16] the Sunday service, listen to it again.
[3:34:19] Maybe the brothers will cut a few
[3:34:24] so we can rehearse on those things. My
[3:34:26] myself before I got married, I was a
[3:34:28] giver.
[3:34:30] After I got married,
[3:34:32] I've been a giver. My family and my wife
[3:34:34] and I and the family, we have been
[3:34:37] givers. But I can tell you what, we've
[3:34:40] seen the blessing of God
[3:34:42] because the things we do, we don't know
[3:34:45] how we are able to accomplish.
[3:34:48] We do it by faith. But I know that God
[3:34:51] honors his word.
[3:34:53] God honors his word.
[3:34:56] So the Lord bless you and give you a
[3:34:57] wonderful week. We're going to meet on
[3:35:00] Wednesday.
[3:35:02] at uh at uh 5:00 p.m.
[3:35:06] &gt;&gt; for our night first of all communion
[3:35:08] service.
[3:35:10] So come prepared for that. If
[3:35:13] can make that ready,
[3:35:16] we're going to have communion service,
[3:35:19] Wednesday night
[3:35:21] from we're going to be here from 5:00
[3:35:23] p.m.
