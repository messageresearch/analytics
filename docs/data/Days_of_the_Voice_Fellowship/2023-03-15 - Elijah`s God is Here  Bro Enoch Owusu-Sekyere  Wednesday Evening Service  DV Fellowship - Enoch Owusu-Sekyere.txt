greetings from our fellowship the original gospel Fellowship in uppsala Fellowship amen Young slowly are people who believe in the same message of the hour three months and I want to tell you there is no I don't message anyway if you go out there you hear stories Hallelujah that we can point you to Christ and say here he is and he was able to tell you a knife that my Ministry that Jesus Christ from other places amen we can point you to go Jesus Christ amen let's take a Bible say man um Second Kings chapter two foreign I don't know if you are using English so um you want to read both or you can follow in in your version so let's say for the sake of time let me read the King James version so second Kings chapter 2 we are reading from verse 9. [Music] and it came to pass let's let's go back to verse 8. and Elijah took his mantle and wrap it together and smooth the waters and there and they were divided so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elijah ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold they appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and pathered them both Asanda and Elijah went up by a whale went into heaven and Elijah saw it and he cried my father my father and The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and ran them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had Smith in the waters departed hida and Tita and Elijah went over amen oh Jesus this is your word tonight [Music] amen let's be seated Hallelujah so tonight I I I just want to share a small thought here amen amen we see Elisha um ask a question Elijah asked the question he said where is the Lord God of Elijah Hallelujah man because he he knew the God that was with Elijah and so when Elijah was taking because there was something that he needed he needed the gods Hallelujah man and we know in this our day God has sent an Elijah Hallelujah man and God took his Elijah and the question that many people especially the young ones the question that we like asking where is the god of William Brown and so my short Title Here is Elijah's God is here hallelujah amen because Elijah is not going with William Brothers about what he needed Elijah told him if you can see me if you can see me then you will get what you're asking for our deco furniture today for you to see the god of your life you must come back to the message amen I tell you the pillar of fire but you um did not go with the prophet the pillar of Christ did not go with the problem Hallelujah I mean it is what do you use that anointing for um he did not put his hand on his head he started crying oh wait where can I get a boat he did not need a bridge and when he said where's the Lord God of Elijah oh he's smarter water and when he did what Elijah did Jordan opened this way and when you go by what the prophet has taught us it wasn't the man too but it was Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever because let's go to Exodus Exodus chapter 13. read it for us the title is where is the Lord God of Elijah um giving the answer Elijah's God is here hallelujah Amina don't think he's somewhere if you think like that you make a mistake he is here because he has promised to be in you even until the consummation of the world so so long as there is in his people Exodus chapter 12 I mean chapter 13.3 21 and 22. foreign in the in the first Exodus Hallelujah the Lord went before them to lead them to lead them the way so you see God was leading them show them their way that's why in this end times so he says the Lord went before them by day in the pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by Night natural in the pillar of in the pillar of fire to give them lights [Music] to take foreign that he sent a pillar of fire and I believe many of you have seen the pillar of fire above God's Prophet have we seen that um and many times we think that Pillar of Fire left with the prophets with God's children today and I can tell you amen that he is still unveiling himself I gave some some pictures to our brother here one way I was preaching in stock of Hallelujah and I was speaking about the presence of the Lord and the presence of the Lord many times amen [Applause] um I've numbered it one is starting from one number one um on the on the pictures there because I see since I'm showing us um I see you're using a media player I just opened the image um so there's number one open the folder because okay so so I I want you to see the original picture of Jesus here hallelujah amen I'm go to number two hallelujah amen and and um this is a bit that way but if you look at the original photo and then you can see there's the cloud of rain that is forming around the picture of Jesus let's go to the next one um here you can see the big ring Hallelujah when the pillow fire drop in that room yeah and here you can see that Pillar of Fire right there on that image um there's another one and here we can still see it Amen brother when I when he passed by a brother sitting on the bus that he passed by I didn't know where it is so when I went home the brother sent me the photos he said go back to the photos and check what I what happened I went back to the photos and I could see the ring Hallelujah the cloud-like ring that we know in the prophet that same Cloud was forming around was hanging in the church like ring is not in the original photos when he comes down when he comes in a meeting it doesn't matter what your problem is sake of cancer you may be sick of every other disease but when it comes down completely healed oh you you will go home as a different person that you have not believed stories if you have ever doubted the supernatural presence of God in the ministry of the Prophet I tell you the same girl you don't have to yeah what we need to do is young men young women old people we must come back to the Bible Doctrine please come back to righteousness that if you are not careful you spend the whole day but God has promised oh Sons and Daughters who prophesy oh young man you will see Affliction of God so for every Church there has to be I mean five-fold Ministries but if we Avail ourselves God can use us in many ways Hallelujah was in the temple Samuel Hallelujah people said there were no open Vision but the Elijah God was still there so one day he spoke to Samuel but why did he speak to somebody because Samuel was closer and always in the temple by Angus Hallelujah Amina if you want to see the god of Elijah um in the message he said that stars he said that's the angry heart of many million tonight he says that is the heart of many million tonight is that they want to find that real holy spirit that fell on the day of Prince many are looking to see the real God that came on the day of Pentacles [Music] and the real gift of God hallelujah Prophet we have read it in the Bible where Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said where is it we have read that he is a great healer why is it we have read that the holy spirit is for you and for your children amen not just for you um and we are living in a day that our children must be baptized with the holies if not the world will swallow them away that you're in second oh my hallelujah hallelujah the Holy Ghost is for you and for your children [Music] and for them that is far off amen even as many as the Lord Our God shall come on prophets of God is asking where is it in our church Hallelujah he's asking the questions that God is there but you need a vessel somebody that will Avail him or herself for God to use them many times when we come for services when the world is coming foreign [Music] foreign center from Heaven a very same power the very same rope the very same room the very same rope that he wore um holy ghosts over 40 years and that man was begging for money um I mean Peter and John he wanted money um but you know many times the priest was passing there maybe the high priest has been passing there you cannot give God Is Not Yours to somebody to give or [Music] but you must open your spiritual eyes foreign [Music] a mad person to me the Holy Ghost it's not unless he goes Simmons [Music] that's why the prophet says amen so so that is the mystery that when he comes you may not recognize even in the Bible there's no way yeah Hallelujah we can
