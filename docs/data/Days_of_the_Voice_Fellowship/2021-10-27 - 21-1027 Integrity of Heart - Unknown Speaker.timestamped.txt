[10:44] [Music]
[10:52] [Music]
[11:10] give him a crop of praise
[11:13] [Music]
[11:26] my bible
[11:30] and we will read from
[11:32] verses we can begin from the first verse
[11:35] to verses 7.
[11:39] to turn the
[11:40] killing
[11:54] b all right first kings 9.
[12:05] and it came to pass when solomon had
[12:08] finished the building of the house of
[12:10] the lord and the king's house and old
[12:12] solomon's desire which he
[12:15] he was
[12:16] pleased to do
[12:32] that the lord appeared to solomon the
[12:34] second time as he had appeared unto him
[12:36] at
[12:43] and the lord said unto him i have heard
[12:45] thy prayer and thy supplication
[12:48] that thou hast made before me and i have
[12:53] allowed this
[12:55] house
[12:56] which thou has built to put my name
[12:59] there forever
[13:01] and
[13:02] mine eyes and my heart shall be there
[13:05] perpetually
[13:25] and if thou wilt walk before me
[13:28] as david thy father walked in integrity
[13:31] of heart and in uprightness to do
[13:33] according to all
[13:36] that i have commanded thee and with that
[13:39] and will keep my statutes and my
[13:41] judgments then i will establish the key
[13:43] the throne of thy kingdom upon israel
[13:45] forever as i promised to david thy
[13:48] father saying there shall not
[13:52] there shall not fail thee a man upon the
[13:55] throne of israel
[13:59] now we will not ambulance
[14:34] all right let us read verse six and
[14:36] seven
[14:38] but if you shall
[14:39] at all turn from following me
[14:42] you or your children
[14:45] and will not keep my commandments and my
[14:47] statutes which i have set before you
[14:50] but go and serve other gods and worship
[14:52] them
[14:53] then will i cut off israel out of the
[14:56] land which i have given them
[14:58] and this house which i have allowed for
[15:00] my name will i cast out of my sight and
[15:03] israel shall be a proverb and a by word
[15:07] among all people
[15:52] i just want to greet each and every one
[15:53] of you in the precious name of jesus
[15:59] and uh we want to thank him for
[16:02] yet an opportunity has given us
[16:31] this evening i'm going to share on
[16:33] something very very important
[16:47] [Music]
[16:48] although you disappeared without
[16:49] informing us and the church where you
[16:51] are gone yeah what they were talking
[16:53] about
[16:55] but uh i was informed by your
[16:58] father names
[17:01] so tonight i'm going to share on the in
[17:04] on integrity of hearts
[17:10] everybody say it integrity of heart
[17:13] integrity of a heart away symbol
[17:17] and
[17:18] i take that from versus three
[17:20] four actually
[17:24] brother give me that verse again first
[17:26] kings nine three he says and the lord
[17:27] said unto him i have had a prayer and
[17:30] this application that thou hast made
[17:32] before me
[17:34] and i have allowed this house which thou
[17:36] has built to put my name there are there
[17:38] forever and my eyes and my heart shall
[17:41] be there perpetually
[17:44] uh look saturn
[18:13] i have heard your prayer i'm pretty dope
[18:15] and i've had your supplication no
[18:17] question you need a quote that you have
[18:19] made before me you're my sugar and
[18:21] therefore i have allowed this house
[18:26] which thou has built johnson to put my
[18:29] name there
[18:41] there is one foreign built in the lord
[18:42] our house and another thing the lord
[18:44] received in that house
[18:51] one thing to do the lord something and
[18:53] it is another it's another
[19:24] but the reason is
[19:25] they don't go to the lord in prayer they
[19:28] don't seek the face of god or the mind
[19:29] of god about what they want to do for
[19:31] him
[19:35] but
[19:36] again their heart is not following the
[19:39] leadership of the lord but their heart
[19:41] is following their own desires and it
[19:44] has on their own objectives and and
[19:47] things that they have and they want to
[19:48] achieve
[20:03] [Music]
[20:25] and so david had wanted to build a house
[20:28] for the lord
[20:31] but before he did he inquired of the
[20:33] lord to see the mind of god
[20:39] and the lord told him no david as much
[20:41] as you were man after my heart i do not
[20:43] allow it
[20:46] you know
[21:00] has built a house for the lord
[21:06] and then the lord came down my command
[21:08] and accepted it a new manager
[21:11] and he said i've heard even your prayer
[21:13] now my name is
[21:28] and if thou
[21:29] now you solomon will walk before me
[21:38] you will walk before me as david your
[21:40] father walked
[21:49] several months ago i did speak on
[21:52] uh
[21:53] you know the relationship having a
[21:56] relationship with god
[22:05] so that when god comes down he is able
[22:07] to introduce himself as the god of
[22:09] so-and-so
[22:14] [Music]
[22:22] because god had a relationship with
[22:24] abraham commander
[22:27] and he introduced himself to isaac
[22:30] if isaac would accept also to have a
[22:33] personal relationship with god
[22:38] then now he
[22:49] [Music]
[22:52] then he becomes the god of you
[22:55] so we noticed here that god was already
[22:57] god of david
[23:01] and he had a relationship with david
[23:02] because david walked with god
[23:50] [Music]
[23:59] [Music]
[24:12] then i will establish your throne amen
[24:14] of thy kingdom upon israel forever
[24:22] your father david saying they shall not
[24:25] fail their man upon the throne of israel
[24:41] you are bound to receive the blessings
[24:43] that david received when he walked
[25:55] always
[25:57] amen i mean god honest integrity of
[26:00] heart
[26:02] symbol
[26:04] he was ready to bless solomon beyond
[26:06] measure
[26:22] integrity is the quality of being honest
[26:25] and fair away
[26:31] honest
[26:37] [Applause]
[26:44] [Applause]
[26:49] you cannot be honest when you have
[26:51] lasciviousness
[26:54] you are going to have wholeness
[26:58] when you have truth in your mouth
[27:02] when you are faithful
[27:04] when
[27:21] [Applause]
[27:35] so we realized that integrity category
[27:38] is the quality of being honest and fair
[27:42] always
[27:46] integrity
[28:01] this is something that originates from
[28:03] the from the from the type from the
[28:06] nature of the heart that you have
[28:13] and many people we are born without
[28:52] [Music]
[29:16] and by the time of the end of the
[29:18] service probably the lord willing we
[29:19] shall have you know covered a few things
[29:21] about this
[29:23] it is
[29:30] [Music]
[29:35] because david was a man after god is
[29:38] owned
[29:52] the bible says
[29:59] [Music]
[30:20] is your heart they sent you liver
[30:23] oh i have the joy in my heart
[30:33] so we also noticed that
[30:34] david was a man after god his own heart
[30:39] you know what he meant
[30:41] his heart
[30:43] is like the heart of god oh my god
[30:47] this was the new heart guardian
[31:02] the bible says in the book of ezekiel
[31:04] that we even god will give you what
[31:06] first
[31:07] the first thing he gives you is a new
[31:09] heart
[31:14] then he gives you a new spirit
[31:38] [Applause]
[31:44] where god is guidelines
[31:49] what was it
[31:51] he gives god his guidelines here
[31:53] uprightness
[31:56] uprightness
[32:19] [Applause]
[32:27] very number is simple
[32:30] you find them packaging a product
[32:35] and they tell you we have abcd
[32:40] but it is not
[32:46] so in a business very many people they
[32:48] don't have the integrity katimo business
[32:50] starting to find the civilian symbol
[32:53] in day-to-day lives
[33:00] sometimes they don't have integrity
[33:04] people around about us our communities
[33:06] our societies no integrity
[33:50] jesus
[34:04] he was faithful
[34:06] would not do anything as long as it was
[34:09] not in the world
[34:12] he asked the people
[34:14] come
[34:16] show me what i've done wrong mooned
[34:18] against
[34:22] [Music]
[34:28] who can tell me that i have not
[34:30] faithfully abided with every
[34:44] jesus did not do anything or say
[34:46] anything as long as it was not written
[34:49] about yes
[34:53] he was having integrity
[34:57] integrity of david's heart always
[35:18] he chose david also his servant and took
[35:21] him from the sheep folds
[35:27] from following the use
[35:29] [Music]
[35:56] so that he can feed the jack of his
[35:58] people ah
[36:00] say a couple of hunters so that he can
[36:02] feed jack of his inheritance
[36:05] lady of zika the inheritance
[36:09] of god wakatonda
[36:24] possession there would be a lot of
[36:28] something his brothers never had
[36:31] something his family never had
[36:34] enough you remember when the man of god
[36:36] went to david's jesus
[37:13] [Music]
[37:19] he was looking for integrity of hearts
[37:25] david that would be he was already
[37:27] trained by the sheep
[37:28] [Music]
[37:30] because remember sheep has a nature
[37:34] and
[38:20] [Music]
[38:31] well people known even naturally
[38:33] speaking that leaders must be fair and
[38:35] they must be honest
[38:39] as a matter of fact but the banham says
[38:41] that if you do not believe in the man of
[38:43] god amazing
[39:25] some people only direct that to the
[39:27] people
[39:30] tell you yeah you must believe in your
[39:32] passion
[39:34] you must subject yourself to your
[39:35] perspective
[39:37] you must obey you must admit go on the
[39:38] way where are you but that also comes to
[39:53] actually in church orders
[39:58] what's the pastor organ
[40:01] he's the kind of man
[40:04] when people uh two people have
[40:06] disagreements
[40:08] that didn't
[40:49] and so the bible tells me here i believe
[40:53] and israel all right he says so god
[40:56] brought him to feed
[40:58] them
[41:02] israel the people of god
[41:18] you cannot go higher than your pasta
[41:21] broth
[41:25] what does that mean
[41:28] also that's many times distracting one
[41:30] side
[41:46] if you look at it the other way
[41:50] the bible tells us so david fed them
[41:53] according to the integrity of his heart
[41:57] [Music]
[42:28] do you understand
[43:10] even the pastors themselves they kind of
[43:12] do those wildlife styles
[43:17] as if electricity has gone through their
[43:18] hair
[43:22] you know like in a very funny way
[43:43] [Applause]
[43:51] what does it mean
[43:53] i cannot go any higher than that
[43:56] but i want to thank god
[44:01] the greatest shepherd
[44:04] just still
[44:05] shaped our souls
[44:21] even as much as god sends us men yet
[44:23] they got turned out to to me the other
[44:24] side to shape at us
[44:28] they rule over us
[44:31] by two things
[44:34] yeah my young people the
[45:00] [Music]
[45:30] and the nature
[45:50] so that's why the bible says that he
[45:52] amen he fed the people according to the
[45:55] integrity of his heart
[45:59] [Music]
[46:11] hallelujah
[46:24] [Music]
[46:41] over his people
[46:45] because thou has not kept that which the
[46:47] lord commanded thee
[46:51] hallelujah
[46:53] and here was god ushering david into the
[46:56] ministry
[46:58] [Music]
[47:00] and how did he introduce him
[47:03] oh how i love it
[47:06] jesus yes he's the one who introduces a
[47:08] mind to the ministry
[47:11] i don't believe it is a man who calls
[47:13] another one into the ministry the secret
[47:15] is the anti-monetary
[47:17] name of awareness for the church obey
[47:18] can you say the denomination
[47:21] system
[47:22] all the bible
[48:18] your heart oh returned
[48:22] this integrity of heart was god's
[48:24] testimony
[48:29] oh god may you give a testimony about me
[48:47] will give his testimony against you
[48:50] amen but the lord that name will come up
[48:56] with jerusalem hallelujah
[48:59] my savior
[49:56] [Music]
[50:11] oh no my judaism
[50:13] and then now time will come
[50:16] for the judgment to be passed
[50:19] and guess what
[50:21] who will be the judge
[50:52] is
[50:58] hallelujah amen
[51:00] some people they say
[51:02] but if your actually knows the judge
[51:50] like that there is no condemnation
[51:52] anybody comes to them that are in christ
[51:57] after the flesh
[52:01] after the spirit
[52:16] is in fact actually i want you to see
[52:18] this their lack of integrity
[52:23] is in
[52:24] is in fact first an issue of the heart
[52:40] if my heart is right
[52:43] when you call me
[52:46] if my heart is right
[52:49] when he calls me
[52:52] if my heart is right
[52:55] when he
[52:56] calls me
[52:58] i'll be somewhere
[53:01] listening for my name
[53:05] if your heart is not right
[53:09] when he calls you back
[53:11] nothing will happen don't worry about to
[53:13] come but if your heart is right
[53:16] when he calls you
[53:18] eater you will hear your name
[53:20] praise the name of the lord
[53:22] now i want to read um another example
[53:25] here in genesis 20.
[53:35] is
[53:36] [Music]
[53:54] to project that for me
[53:56] now from verse one brother you can just
[53:58] interpret directly
[54:00] now abraham journeyed from there toward
[54:03] the towards the negev the south country
[54:05] even settled between kurdish and shu
[54:08] then
[54:13] [Music]
[55:16] she was his wife
[55:32] kill me so he will check my wife
[55:38] let me tell you tell him only half truth
[55:45] she's my sister oh yo man
[55:48] some people they don't want to lie
[55:52] but they want to tell half truth
[55:53] [Applause]
[55:55] your half truth is
[56:02] if you you know what you're supposed to
[56:04] say tell it all
[56:06] be honest
[56:09] [Music]
[56:12] and you will find out
[56:27] did you know there is a certain level of
[56:30] grace that god has given to his servants
[56:40] be careful before you say you are
[56:41] telling a white lie like abraham
[56:54] my
[56:58] abraham said again of sarah she is my
[57:00] sister
[57:03] until um
[57:12] god came to our marriage in a dream
[57:14] during the night
[57:19] and said
[57:21] behold
[57:22] you are a dead man
[57:39] because we are god's children
[57:42] but if we have done things wrong never
[57:44] to sober god was still fighting for us
[57:50] that is why he says
[57:52] not my anointed
[58:05] [Applause]
[58:19] if you don't believe me that's up to you
[58:21] hey what does your kid is a cheerleader
[58:23] but i'm preaching to you
[58:25] because i have a physical ground
[58:29] if you have a covenant with god
[59:03] i
[59:16] son of god
[59:18] amen or whatever you are you're not
[59:20] you're better god is there with you
[59:23] when you were stealing sin bro
[59:25] the movie he was with you now and the
[59:27] fact that he was with you
[59:29] again
[59:30] he brought
[59:44] god was with abraham
[59:46] abraham
[59:47] because we know that he goes on to
[59:48] confirm the covenant over and over
[59:51] god was always with him
[59:56] hallelujah amen our the weapons of our
[59:59] failure are not cannabis
[1:00:05] they bring down strongholds
[1:00:10] watch them beat everyone in a dream
[1:01:27] had not yet come near her so he said
[1:01:30] lord will you kill a people who are
[1:01:34] righteous and innocent and blameless
[1:01:59] [Music]
[1:02:03] she told me that he told me that she is
[1:02:05] my sister
[1:02:08] and she herself said he is my brother
[1:02:13] in the integrity of my heart
[1:02:37] and the bible said that david had the
[1:02:40] integrity of his heart at the bible
[1:02:43] you know where symbol is the
[1:02:45] skillfulness of his hand
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:28] before you can't you take it
[1:03:31] let me present this before you can't you
[1:03:33] take it
[1:03:35] something let me present something
[1:03:36] before you let me continue
[1:03:39] and what it represents
[1:03:41] number one
[1:03:42] the integrity
[1:03:57] do you do it out of the integrity of
[1:03:59] your heart
[1:04:03] do you do it out of the
[1:04:05] innocence of your hand
[1:04:10] sometimes you find believers i said
[1:04:12] believers
[1:04:16] let me do it okay
[1:04:19] let him feel it
[1:04:38] foreign
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:53] when when he heard what the man had to
[1:04:55] show
[1:04:56] yeah
[1:04:58] then god said to him in
[1:05:01] the dream
[1:05:04] god speaks through even
[1:05:06] the name
