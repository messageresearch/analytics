[0:08] praise God but we just thought for the
[0:11] interest of others who are waiting we
[0:13] don't take long to wait on that then to
[0:15] will take another 30 minutes so we have
[0:18] because we have several questions here
[0:20] some of which I think are very important
[0:22] and we need to deal
[0:23] with praise
[0:25] God Amen
[0:28] uh brother you looking at me very very
[0:31] sad are you okay you can see Deon if
[0:34] you're not
[0:36] okay and they can sort you yes you
[0:39] Brother
[0:41] Joseph he's saying
[0:43] me so we should smile
[0:47] right some of you are hungry but you
[0:49] know I I remember when we were still
[0:52] when I was still young as many of you we
[0:55] used to go CA from morning up to late in
[0:58] the evening no food and you have two
[1:00] services and no food so it shouldn't be
[1:02] a problem that uh if someone is saying
[1:04] me I'm fainting it means you never fast
[1:07] it means you never fast but I think we
[1:09] should have people who are resilient
[1:10] young people who here in Africa we are
[1:12] very strong you can even fast for you
[1:14] know for
[1:15] longer uh but for me I'm very tired I
[1:18] feel tired because of not only preaching
[1:21] but also yesterday we busy and driving
[1:24] and tomorrow we are traveling so just
[1:25] pray for me that God will give me
[1:27] strength so now um
[1:30] I'm not going to take a lot a lot of
[1:32] time my target is to spend here one hour
[1:35] so here is how we are going to do it
[1:36] it's not really a preaching it's not
[1:38] really a service of preaching uh I we
[1:41] just I just wanted us to have an
[1:42] interaction with a young people with a
[1:46] youth uh this one is also
[1:52] youth this one is 3 years old he should
[1:54] not have been here and the other one and
[1:56] the other one but uh it is all right I
[1:59] don't think will they will hear what we
[2:01] saying anyhow but uh you never know they
[2:05] can hear something which will be a
[2:06] blessing to them so now usually we have
[2:08] been having this youth service how many
[2:10] remembers how many times we've had it so
[2:13] far how many times have we had it so
[2:17] far I don't want to look this side I
[2:19] wanted to look only one side Brothers
[2:20] come this side kindly there chair
[2:23] here this sisters are very spirit filled
[2:27] Brethren don't fear to sit near them you
[2:29] don't have any issues there is even a
[2:32] chair in the middle there brother you
[2:33] can sit right there in the middle if you
[2:35] want or behind there whatever
[2:39] uh brother okay all right okay so now I
[2:43] can see
[2:44] everyone which uh is this the third time
[2:47] we are having this youth
[2:49] meeting oh okay so this is the third
[2:52] time and
[2:54] um I I always think it is very good for
[2:58] us to have this meeting
[3:00] a place where we can come and discuss
[3:03] and share and talk even when I'm talking
[3:06] and you feel you have a burning question
[3:08] or a burning comment we have a
[3:10] microphone
[3:11] here which we shall give you okay so
[3:15] this is like an
[3:16] interaction uh because sometimes we we
[3:20] preachers come they preach you go home
[3:23] they preach you go home they preach you
[3:24] go home and sometimes I feel that we
[3:27] need to have a moment like this where we
[3:29] can come you ask questions things things
[3:32] that you are
[3:33] thinking and also things that are
[3:35] serious and things that are are helping
[3:37] us to grow maybe you can ask something
[3:40] not for you only but for somebody else
[3:42] and you never know how it can impact
[3:44] their lives before I go into the
[3:46] questions the three things I wanted to
[3:48] remind you of I've spoken about it
[3:50] before uh that is killing Our Generation
[3:54] today not only today but really from
[3:56] time IM memorial three things number one
[4:00] and I want you to take this microphone I
[4:03] want someone a brother or a sister
[4:06] volunteer come quickly okay so you'll be
[4:08] giving this microphone to whoever ises
[4:10] up their hand you can stand there or
[4:12] stand this
[4:13] side there are three things um that I
[4:16] want you to help me explain or expound
[4:18] because I've Tau on it here before one
[4:21] is the pride of life two is the lust of
[4:23] the eyes and three is the last of the
[4:26] flesh I'd like us to begin the pride of
[4:28] life what what to you is the pride of
[4:31] life anyone with an
[4:34] answer please just show up raise your
[4:37] hand and then we shall give you the
[4:39] microphone so you can share on
[4:46] that did we understand each
[4:49] other sister
[4:51] fortunate you can give her the
[4:53] microphone she wants to
[4:55] answer I saw her wanting to put up the
[4:58] hand what is the pride of
[5:01] life God bless you amen for me in I was
[5:06] just trying
[5:07] to understand what your question has
[5:10] actually
[5:12] meaning but what do you understand by
[5:14] the pride of life when okay pride of
[5:17] life I'm seeing it in two ways there's
[5:19] the spiritual one and the life on Earth
[5:22] so I don't know what your meaning here
[5:24] on Earth maybe my pride of life
[5:30] be being
[5:33] rich yes attaining a better level of
[5:37] education and a good position thank you
[5:41] then spiritually oh my pride of life
[5:44] would be maybe know my spiritual life
[5:47] growing more and more and having a
[5:49] better interaction with
[5:51] God okay now you had your own definition
[5:54] of that but um uh thank you thank you
[5:58] can we please give our hand
[6:00] and now if you remember in the Book of
[6:04] Genesis there are three things that
[6:06] Jesus Christ did speak about rather
[6:08] Jesus Christ that uh um the Bible in the
[6:12] Book of Genesis it speaks about three
[6:15] things that Adam and Eve had to overcome
[6:19] and these are the three things you
[6:22] remember what the devil said the tree
[6:23] was was what do you remember the
[6:25] description of the tree the tree of
[6:26] knowledge it was what it was having
[6:28] those three things it was good for food
[6:30] what is
[6:32] that what is that last of the flesh uhuh
[6:38] it was what
[6:41] else it could make someone wise what is
[6:45] that pride of life right uh what
[6:52] else sorry are we
[6:55] together huh
[7:01] you can open the Bible and get there or
[7:02] give the microphone to
[7:05] someone so pleas to the eyes thank you
[7:09] God bless you give my daughter here
[7:10] another hand oh this is wonderful if
[7:13] every one of you were like would have
[7:15] been having a very good interaction so
[7:18] listen the tree could was pleasant to
[7:22] the eyes that is what the last of the
[7:24] eyes and also the tree was good for food
[7:30] meaning the last of the flesh what your
[7:33] body what
[7:34] desires what your eyes desire and also
[7:38] it could make one wise so you see this
[7:40] is the excuse the devil gave to to Adam
[7:43] and Eve enticing them with those things
[7:47] that they should eat the
[7:48] tree ahuh now do we remember the three
[7:52] temptations that Jesus uh suffered by
[7:55] the hand of the devil when he was taken
[7:58] up uh when he was coming down from
[8:01] fasting 40 days and um three things
[8:04] there were three things how many
[8:05] remember and can you take us through
[8:07] them yes yes Sister Mary God bless you
[8:12] amen I think the first Temptation was
[8:14] that Jesus was hungry yes he was hungry
[8:18] he told him to change the stones into
[8:20] bread into bread the last of the flesh
[8:23] yes what your flesh desires number two
[8:27] then the second one was he took him up
[8:30] on the mountain yes and showed him the
[8:33] beautiful things and he said if you Bow
[8:36] Down and Worship me I will give you
[8:39] everything what is that friends sorry
[8:43] the last of the eyes number
[8:47] three I'm trying to remember the third
[8:50] word to worship him yes he said if
[8:56] you if you if you can jump on from up to
[8:59] down the angels will be able to they
[9:01] will carry you you will not fall down
[9:03] you see you can go like woohoo you like
[9:06] you just not fall down and then that's
[9:08] the pride of life God bless you Sister
[9:10] Mary let us give her a hand please now
[9:14] friends do you see the trend that Adam
[9:18] and Eve had to overcome that they failed
[9:20] and Jesus also had to overcome that did
[9:23] he fail he overcame so Jesus overcame
[9:27] what Satan failed to overcome and that's
[9:29] why what I was preaching is we can only
[9:31] overcome in him in Christ we can only
[9:34] boast in him because he's the one who
[9:36] overcame everything we in our natural uh
[9:39] uh in our natural life could not
[9:42] overcome K today we are still fighting
[9:45] those three
[9:46] things H by the way each of you each of
[9:48] us here is fighting those three things
[9:50] there is no other battle we are fighting
[9:52] there is no other demon we are fighting
[9:54] it's only those three things that's why
[9:56] bam said the greatest enemy that I have
[9:58] is myself it isoss to live a Christian
[10:01] life but you see those are the three
[10:03] things you have to overcome everything
[10:05] else whatever you might said this one
[10:08] that one it is all bound up in there if
[10:10] you can overcome the pride of life
[10:13] against you overcome the lust of the
[10:15] flesh you overcome the last of the eyes
[10:19] the the pride of life did I say the
[10:21] pride of life the last of the eyes is
[10:26] theala you know I mean the last of the
[10:29] eyes
[10:34] you know you can see you can be passing
[10:36] a road and you see someone who has a
[10:37] very nice building and you're like oh I
[10:39] wish this was mine and then the devil
[10:41] begins telling you you can do this and
[10:43] this and this to go and get it you see
[10:46] someone you know uh achieving something
[10:50] good in life instead of supporting them
[10:52] and praying with them and being happy
[10:53] for them you feel like I wish it was
[10:54] mine because you have seen it and you
[10:56] desire it for yourself you see the the
[10:59] the the lust of the flesh the lust of
[11:01] the eyes and the
[11:13] pr we are have we are having such
[11:16] battles and we never seek for help one
[11:19] of the things that I always want to tell
[11:20] you when we have meetings like this is
[11:23] that the office of a pastor is not there
[11:26] as a picture or as an image for you to
[11:29] look at or as someone who just comes and
[11:32] preaches and he goes away take advantage
[11:35] you know some of you who go to school
[11:36] when you in a holiday others who are not
[11:39] in a holiday you know doesn't matter
[11:41] what uh kind of things you are doing in
[11:43] your life maybe you are working or maybe
[11:46] you you know you you go to school but
[11:48] you not in Holiday find time if you're
[11:51] going through things it could be one of
[11:52] these and you you need help you need
[11:56] help one thing that I realized is that
[11:59] that here in Africa even adults it is
[12:03] very difficult to hear someone saying
[12:05] that they need
[12:10] help you be there needing help but you
[12:13] cannot humble yourself to to go and say
[12:16] you know what I need help I'm going
[12:18] through this I need help how are you I'm
[12:20] fine is everything fine oh everything is
[12:22] all right God is giving us Grace but you
[12:24] know you are going through hell and you
[12:27] know the devil is squeezing you in a
[12:28] corner if you can't come to seek for
[12:30] help the devil will overcome you we
[12:33] should humble ourself and always seek
[12:35] help when we when we can get it people
[12:38] backer slide and others um you know find
[12:42] themselves trapped by the devil because
[12:44] they never sought help so one of these
[12:46] meetings some of these meetings is to
[12:48] give help by force to give you help by
[12:50] force because you don't come to seek for
[12:52] it so I'm bringing you here to give it
[12:54] to you by force ask your questions
[12:56] because I need to hear how are you how
[12:58] are you are you growing
[12:59] there are certain questions I've seen
[13:01] and I was like this person is very
[13:02] either young in the young physically or
[13:05] or they very young in the spirit some
[13:08] questions I was looking at so it
[13:11] questions show me how are the people are
[13:13] they
[13:14] growing people are not growing are we
[13:17] getting somewhere so and some questions
[13:19] are very mature and we'll begin right
[13:21] away to go into these questions if you
[13:23] have any question right there you just
[13:24] raise up your hand and we will uh give
[13:27] you the chance so the plan is to go
[13:30] until
[13:31] 4 um uh around 4:20 that will be 1 hour
[13:36] from now so that that will be as much as
[13:39] we will be able to go and then uh we
[13:41] shall release you now I have a few
[13:44] questions here asked by you um we are
[13:47] going to go one by one someone asked a
[13:49] question Kane went to the town
[13:53] of
[13:54] no he says no but it is nod and married
[13:59] and gave
[14:00] birth with her he says with her who was
[14:04] Kane's wife praise the name of the
[14:07] Lord ah sincerely I would like to know
[14:09] who asked this question because this one
[14:11] is a mature believer who asked this
[14:13] question ah brother Solomon let us give
[14:16] him a hand very good question now
[14:19] straight away let's go to the scripture
[14:21] and we answer this question right away
[14:22] and then we go to
[14:24] others
[14:27] um uh we will we can read many
[14:31] scriptures but uh I think I was I wanted
[14:33] to read this scripture in Genesis but I
[14:35] think all of us know where it
[14:37] is uh I'll just
[14:40] um uh read for you a quote
[14:50] here okay in the message questions and
[14:53] answers thank God we have a prophet who
[14:55] already had questions and answers and we
[14:56] can copy from there Hal Hallelujah so uh
[15:01] questions and answers on Genesis 53
[15:06] 0729 the question is who was Cain's wife
[15:09] and brother bam says so Cain married his
[15:15] sister then they went over there in the
[15:17] Land of
[15:18] Nod now we get into a deep subject if we
[15:22] went a little farther and I'm glad you
[15:24] you never asked any further than that
[15:27] like where was those giants that was in
[15:29] the land of that day because we can also
[15:32] go and talk about those giants how did
[15:35] did the Giants come into view but of
[15:39] course we know that the Giants came as a
[15:41] as a a result of the mixture of the two
[15:44] of the people from the land from the
[15:47] Lage of Cain and the Lage of Seth inter
[15:51] Maring and then the Giants came out as a
[15:53] result so some people are thinking that
[15:55] Giants were Angels no no no they were
[15:56] not Angels it was just the Bible says
[15:59] sons of God saw the daughters of men and
[16:01] they married who are the sons of God
[16:04] those from the line of Adam which is the
[16:06] line of Seth and the daughters of men
[16:08] were those out from the linage of Cain
[16:11] so when they intermarried with these
[16:13] ones then they brought forth Giants at
[16:15] that time so we see here brother bam
[16:18] says okay we not go deeper into those
[16:20] things but uh he says Cain's wife was
[16:23] his sister K married his sister and they
[16:25] went to the Land of Nod he didn't go to
[16:27] the Land of Nod and then found he a a
[16:30] wife to marry he actually made the land
[16:33] of no he and his wife were the ones who
[16:35] went there and they called the land of
[16:36] no um then you would say how do you uh
[16:42] end up with that answer now if you read
[16:44] in the Bible usually in the Bible they
[16:46] do not record the birth of girls they
[16:52] usually only record the birth of boys um
[16:55] how many people did Jesus Christ feed
[17:01] sorry
[17:03] 9,000
[17:04] 5,000 but do you actually know it was
[17:07] much more than that it might have been
[17:08] like
[17:09] 15,000 that number 5,000 does not
[17:12] include women and it does not include
[17:16] children because in the Jewish tradition
[17:19] women were never counted when they were
[17:21] counting anything and even the the uh
[17:26] when they they were announcing B so now
[17:29] like the Bible announces the birth of
[17:31] Adam's children like Abel and then Seth
[17:36] and then others but do you ever see the
[17:38] Bible announcing any daughter of Adam
[17:40] there is no record of any daughter of
[17:42] Adam are you saying Adam gave birth only
[17:45] to Sons So Adam also had daughters but
[17:48] we never know who they were we never
[17:50] knew not only did Cain marry his sister
[17:53] but also we believe Seth married his
[17:56] sister because there was no other people
[17:58] on earth at the time praise the Lord so
[18:01] that is answered that way are you
[18:04] satisfied
[18:05] brother you are not
[18:08] satisfied oh okay you're satisfied all
[18:10] right uh how many are blessed by that
[18:13] question you see if you had not come to
[18:15] the youth service you would not have got
[18:17] that answer and someone else will ask
[18:19] you out there and you will be looking
[18:21] around you don't know the answer but
[18:23] when you come to a service like this you
[18:24] can quickly get that answer from the
[18:26] message now someone says God bless you
[18:30] fellow youth why do I always get
[18:32] disappointed in God I always believe for
[18:36] something but it does not happen and it
[18:39] hurts me a
[18:41] lot and I think this question I'll
[18:44] answer it together with this because the
[18:45] handwriting is the same and it looks
[18:47] like it is the same person that uh asked
[18:51] the question says God bless you fellow
[18:53] youth why am I still in this bad way of
[18:56] living my parents don't earn enough we
[18:59] are poor yet I have been praying my
[19:02] whole life and believing Pastor
[19:07] why okay very good question now the
[19:11] other first question says I think she's
[19:14] a sister the way she's
[19:16] writing or he I don't know some younger
[19:19] men write very well so he says I always
[19:22] get disappointed in God now we shall
[19:24] begin there right there that's where
[19:26] your problem is you get disappoint
[19:28] appointed in God now I could read a ton
[19:31] of scriptures but I'll read whatever
[19:33] will come into my mind uh the scripture
[19:36] says we shall read um here in the Bible
[19:39] in the book of
[19:43] um I Isiah wait a moment let me
[19:54] see okay
[20:11] um we'll read
[20:13] Isaiah chapter
[20:15] 40:31 but they that
[20:17] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[20:22] strength they shall Mount up with wings
[20:25] as eagles they shall run and not be
[20:27] weary they shall walk and not faint now
[20:32] sister or brother whoever ask this
[20:33] question the first thing that I want you
[20:35] to know is God is not a
[20:37] man and God does not lie whatever God
[20:42] says in his word which we we call today
[20:44] the Bible he fulfills it because he says
[20:48] he's faithful man is not faithful but
[20:51] God is faithful now today I was
[20:54] preaching faith and I said the only
[20:57] thing we need to have is faith the Bible
[20:59] says without faith can you finish the
[21:04] scripture remember if you're hungry you
[21:06] go see the Deon there so that you are
[21:08] all Lively if you are very hungry and
[21:10] you can't talk you're about to faint go
[21:11] see Deon Mond out there he will fix you
[21:14] you will fix you so uhhuh I believe
[21:17] brother Marin has just been fixed right
[21:19] now
[21:21] so the scripture says without faith it
[21:24] is impossible to do what to please God
[21:27] and they that come to God
[21:29] God they that come to God must believe
[21:32] what that he is and is's a rewarder of
[21:37] them that diligently remember diligently
[21:41] seek him when you are seeking after God
[21:44] you must be diligent you must you must
[21:47] be honest you must be sincere you must
[21:49] do it with all your heart you you you
[21:51] you must not do it because of your
[21:53] mother because of your father because of
[21:54] how others I saw so and so praying and
[21:56] they they gave a testimony like this let
[21:58] me also do like them no you come to God
[22:01] on your own that's why I said today it's
[22:03] not about you praying in the church no
[22:05] you have to have a personal devotion a
[22:08] personal time with God so when you say
[22:09] you prayed and your prayer was not
[22:11] answered how did you pray because the
[22:13] Bible says that they pray and they don't
[22:15] receive what they pray for because they
[22:17] pray am Miss how do you pray am Miss by
[22:20] praying out of the will of God it's just
[22:22] like me right now saying oh God may you
[22:25] provide me a wife that prayer will not
[22:27] be answered cuz God has already provided
[22:30] me a wife I'm married you understand
[22:32] brother so if I'm praying such a prayer
[22:34] it is a miss and we you have heard
[22:36] people who come and say oh God spoke to
[22:38] me and he showed me in the in the vision
[22:40] even a number of a of a a woman he told
[22:43] me to marry and this man who is saying
[22:45] this is married and then you find that
[22:47] he's getting a second wife because that
[22:50] they found in the dream or one person
[22:52] gave them a vision or one person spoke
[22:54] to them a prophecy that so and so is not
[22:56] your wife so and so is your wife so I
[22:57] mean how do you know the will of God is
[23:00] in his word the will of God will always
[23:03] be in his word so as long as your prayer
[23:06] is according to the will of God oh my
[23:09] there's much I can say about this but I
[23:11] will not be prolonging things but I
[23:13] would say this there are many things you
[23:16] can even do and God will not be pleased
[23:19] if you don't do it out of faith for
[23:20] example you can come and give money to
[23:23] the basket and you know you put your
[23:25] money but God will not be pleased with
[23:27] your offering
[23:29] did you know that why how come that you
[23:31] can give money and God will not be
[23:33] pleased with your offering it is not
[23:36] what you give or how much you give or
[23:39] it's not even about the giving it's
[23:41] about the Revelation and the prophet
[23:43] told us Revelation is faith faith is a
[23:46] revelation of the will of God you
[23:48] understand so if God has revealed
[23:52] himself to you then you go to prayer and
[23:55] I'll give you my testimony you said here
[23:57] that you pray and things don't happen
[23:59] your whole life and and and and you you
[24:02] have been a Christian your whole life
[24:03] you have been praying your whole life
[24:04] and you have been believing your whole
[24:06] life and you say that you always believe
[24:08] for something but it doesn't happen and
[24:10] it hurts you a lot and I'll tell you
[24:13] this sister oh brother the very first
[24:16] thing you need to do is to understand is
[24:18] that you have to develop you yourself a
[24:21] personal relationship with God I want
[24:23] you to imagine if I was your friend but
[24:27] every time you meet me you ask me for
[24:29] things will that relationship continue
[24:31] for so
[24:32] long will it come on answer me if you're
[24:36] not so so hungry and you're not about to
[24:38] faint you will not that relationship
[24:41] will stop it will not go so long because
[24:44] our relationship is based on me giving
[24:46] you and you receiving but I believe as
[24:49] it is in every healthy relationship it
[24:52] should not be whenever you go before God
[24:55] you're praying oh God
[25:03] there is no day you will ever come
[25:05] before him to worship His Majesty to
[25:07] tell him how great he is how about
[25:10] changing your strategy instead of coming
[25:12] to ask for things come to worship him
[25:15] develop a relationship with him first
[25:17] get to know him get to know him because
[25:20] the Bible says to know him is life and
[25:23] peace if you get to know him you get you
[25:26] develop a relationship with Jesus Christ
[25:29] now it is easier to ask a friend for
[25:32] something than to ask a stranger for
[25:34] something because when you ask a friend
[25:36] a friend will not not disappoint you
[25:38] because he's concerned about your
[25:40] relationship that you have with him or
[25:42] with her so in this way sister or
[25:44] brother you need to develop a
[25:45] relationship with Jesus Christ first be
[25:47] filled with the Holy Ghost if you you
[25:49] are not and if you believe you are then
[25:52] you need to change the way you approach
[25:55] God don't approach him by asking for
[25:57] things some sometimes you just even need
[25:59] to just simply worship him and then you
[26:01] realize he will give you whatever you
[26:03] have desired without even as opening
[26:05] your mouth to ask for anything many of
[26:07] the big things in my life it was not
[26:09] because I prayed so much or I fasted so
[26:12] much it was because I yielded my heart
[26:15] and and and I focused on serving God
[26:18] with all my life like I gave him my life
[26:20] and then he also decided to bless me
[26:21] with a few things in my life now you say
[26:24] that you have been you are poor I want
[26:26] you to change that you are not poor
[26:29] because you see this is what the devil
[26:31] has made you to believe there is no
[26:33] person who can be in Christ and be poor
[26:35] by the way it is impossible it is
[26:37] impossible if you are in Christ you
[26:39] cannot be poor you cannot what is
[26:42] poverty can someone Define for me what
[26:44] poverty
[26:50] is you all cannot Define it because
[26:52] you're all poor or
[26:56] what switch it on
[26:59] it's a permanent state of
[27:02] Lu okay that's a an interesting
[27:05] definition poverty is a permanent state
[27:08] of lack and it's a very good one now who
[27:12] is the richest man on
[27:15] earth can somebody answer
[27:18] that yes who is
[27:21] it
[27:23] sorry
[27:26] helon h
[27:29] ah Elon Musk Aon musk Aon musk ah okay
[27:33] Aon musk according to you is the richest
[27:36] man on earth now maybe I will tell you
[27:38] the richest man on earth the the richest
[27:41] man on earth is a
[27:43] Christian do you know
[27:45] why because God is the creator not only
[27:49] the owner but also the creator of Heaven
[27:53] and Earth and everything that is in
[27:57] there
[27:58] by the way he's the owner of the whole
[28:02] universe whatever you look at it is God
[28:05] who created it do we believe that we
[28:08] believe in the existence of God and if
[28:10] we do then he is the creator of the
[28:12] earth and the
[28:14] fullness thereof now if that God was in
[28:22] you think about it would you be poor it
[28:26] is impossible that's why the only only
[28:28] rich person on earth is a Christian a
[28:31] man or woman who has known God and who
[28:35] has had a personal relationship with
[28:37] Jesus Christ the problem that we have
[28:39] people believe things about God but they
[28:41] don't believe God they they receive
[28:44] things from God but they don't receive
[28:46] God but if you can receive God you will
[28:48] never ever call yourself poor again in
[28:51] fact don't even said these words because
[28:53] the moment you begin to say it you
[28:54] prophesying poverty over your life never
[28:57] accept
[28:59] poor I will tell you a little bit of my
[29:02] story I was born in a village and uh I I
[29:08] saw when we were sleeping do you know um
[29:12] what is
[29:14] this uh I am I'm sorry forgive me for
[29:17] dwelling on on these two questions for a
[29:19] while because I feel this person needs
[29:21] to hear this
[29:30] get is it called a poly sack a sack and
[29:34] then inside they put grass which has
[29:37] dried up they dry it and then you put it
[29:39] inside there and then they tie it and
[29:41] that's a mattress and you don't have bed
[29:43] sheets you are sleeping on it and maybe
[29:46] your mother can give you his gas her gas
[29:48] and then you put on it and and cover
[29:50] yourself how many have ever slept in
[29:51] that here uhuh I would have said those
[29:55] are my fellow poor people but but let me
[29:58] tell you we don't call ourselves poor
[30:01] now to you I I even believe whoever
[30:03] asked this I believe whoever asked this
[30:07] has never slept on a sack with grass in
[30:11] it as a
[30:12] mattress but you call yourself poor it's
[30:14] an insult of God that's how we we where
[30:19] I was born in a grass touched house and
[30:22] um later on when we went to the city our
[30:25] city was mende mende is
[30:28] here we call it a village but at that
[30:29] time it was a city for us and I would
[30:32] walk I don't remember how many
[30:34] kilometers but several of them because
[30:35] we would walk all the way from downtown
[30:37] mend to the other side near the barracks
[30:39] where there is the school H we used to I
[30:42] used to go to aname school because my
[30:43] parents couldn't afford private school
[30:45] so all my um uh primary we went to an
[30:50] army school where we were paying public
[30:52] I mean we're paying nothing almost but
[30:54] it was also still a lot for us and uh we
[30:57] went there and and you would walk you
[31:00] would not say thatth it is too long I
[31:02] will not my father I remember he took me
[31:04] to school one time when he was taking me
[31:06] for registration in P1 and and and the
[31:10] following day I took
[31:12] myself God have mercy how many here in
[31:17] P1 I'm see I'm trying to look
[31:21] around oh that one is n p
[31:23] one come come here he
[31:28] goodness I was very young but I think
[31:30] how old are
[31:32] you five ah no some of us were starting
[31:36] P when we were big I was not your age
[31:38] who is seven years
[31:41] here you are seven come here I was this
[31:44] young boy's
[31:45] age and I started taking myself to
[31:48] school walking about 5 to 10 kilomet to
[31:51] school and Crossing roads some of them
[31:54] highways and then you go and you walk to
[31:56] school and every single day and
[31:59] sometimes they chest you for school fees
[32:00] you go back and then again you go back
[32:02] and I'm telling you God bless you and
[32:04] I'm telling you we me from growing up I
[32:08] never believed I was poor because even
[32:10] our parents never told us we were poor
[32:12] so we don't we do not believe we were
[32:13] poor we believed we were Rich because we
[32:16] had God because at that time we were
[32:17] still in the Anglican church and um we
[32:19] were believing in that to a Revival so
[32:22] they always told us if you have God you
[32:24] are rich if you have God you are rich
[32:26] and um we never behaved poor we never
[32:29] thought we were poor and because of that
[32:32] all of us with all my other siblings you
[32:34] see we've made it in life we've got
[32:37] families and you know moving on with
[32:40] life I cannot say really I'm poor I I'm
[32:43] not poor many times these days even when
[32:44] I say I am rich people think that I am
[32:47] proud because I'm saying I'm rich but me
[32:48] I keep saying it I am rich and if you
[32:51] call me poor I am your enemy from that
[32:53] day I am not poor
[32:56] now poverty is permanent lack is that
[32:59] the definition is when you lack and you
[33:02] lack permanently from year to year you
[33:04] lack now you cannot have permanent lack
[33:07] when you have the provider of everything
[33:09] and the creator of everything in your
[33:10] life you can never do that and I think
[33:13] to me it is a mindset change you begin
[33:17] you begin by changing your mindset
[33:19] refuse poverty to begin with refuse that
[33:21] mindset that you are poor refuse to
[33:23] accept that you are poor you know I used
[33:25] to we used to walk on feet even until
[33:27] got married I was walking on foot we did
[33:29] not even have a bicycle and someone
[33:31] would bring a car and then all the dust
[33:33] goes in your eyes and on your good
[33:35] clothes and I'll be like oh don't worry
[33:37] my dear we shall also buy a car now we
[33:39] have a car and and we are the ones now
[33:42] taking them s so so in other words
[33:46] friends it is what you have in your head
[33:48] if your head is telling you are poor you
[33:50] will be poor if your head is saying you
[33:52] are rich then you will indeed make it
[33:54] sometimes it is the mentality the
[33:55] mentality that you have that's why I
[33:58] encourage you to keep coming to hear the
[34:00] word to read the Bible because no one
[34:02] person can read the word feed on the
[34:04] word and accept what the devil has told
[34:07] them about themselves you will accept
[34:10] what God has spoken about yourself it
[34:13] won't be about your feeling it will be
[34:14] about the word of God and what you
[34:16] believe uh for it to be in your life and
[34:19] some of you that's how you going to
[34:20] break poverty you may have you may have
[34:23] come from a home which didn't even ever
[34:24] drive or didn't ever have a bicycle but
[34:26] you can break the cycle God does not
[34:28] only give us spiritual blessings he
[34:30] gives us also physical blessings you see
[34:33] so sister or brother please don't say
[34:36] that ever again in your life you that
[34:39] your parents don't ear enough and we are
[34:40] poor you are not poor they may not have
[34:42] be they not be earning enough but you
[34:45] are not poor and you are saying you have
[34:48] been praying all your life and believing
[34:50] now that's why I read you that scripture
[34:52] keep believing but change your strategy
[34:54] on how you're praying on how you're
[34:56] approaching God h and then uh do not
[34:59] confess poverty but what you do is the
[35:01] Bible says they that wait upon God shall
[35:03] do what renew their strength they shall
[35:05] Mount up with wings as Eagles when I
[35:07] reached Senor to there about um uh I did
[35:13] not have tution again and I I couldn't
[35:15] go to school so I went cuz I believed I
[35:17] had a rich God so I went I I told God I
[35:20] said God if this message is true if this
[35:22] message is true supernaturally open a
[35:26] channel for me to have tution without
[35:28] begging anyone that I always added that
[35:30] one whenever I needed money I always
[35:32] told god without begging without begging
[35:33] cuz i' never believed in begging from
[35:35] that time I mean since that time I never
[35:37] believed in it don't believe in begging
[35:39] whenever you you lack something you run
[35:41] to someone please borrow me and when you
[35:43] borrow you don't pay them and that's why
[35:45] you remain in poverty because even when
[35:47] you borrow a lot and God provides for
[35:50] you you will not even remember to pay
[35:52] tithe because you see you have a lot of
[35:53] debts you will always be in debts you
[35:55] will always so in other words don't
[35:57] don't believe in those kind of things if
[35:59] you don't believe in something God will
[36:01] be God will make us sure he will not
[36:03] allow you to go that that that Journey
[36:05] but if you believe in it well of course
[36:07] it will happen to you so which story was
[36:09] I telling you senior two I didn't have
[36:11] tution and then I prayed I said God if
[36:14] this message is the truth I usually
[36:16] wanted to put God to a challenge if this
[36:18] message is the truth provide for me
[36:21] without begging and let me have my
[36:23] tution and I would pray and pray and
[36:25] then after I pray that I thank him I
[36:27] begin to appreciate him and believe it
[36:28] is done I begin singing songs it is done
[36:31] the good transaction is done say it is
[36:33] it is already done it is finished oh my
[36:36] Higher Ground I feel I'm on Higher
[36:37] Ground I feel is already done even
[36:39] before you rece you receive anything
[36:41] even before you see something tangible
[36:44] by the way those are the things younger
[36:46] people be should be doing in prayer
[36:48] because you see these things I'm imagine
[36:50] whoever ask this you in a tough
[36:51] situation but how are you dealing with a
[36:54] tough situation when situation gets
[36:55] tough you also should get tough in
[36:57] prayer in prayer you challenge God you
[37:00] go to God In Prayer you challenge him
[37:02] you know you you you come to church you
[37:03] fast you pray you you know that's what
[37:05] you do you you step up your game as well
[37:08] and I did and I waited I I I challenged
[37:10] God and it's a very long story I don't
[37:13] have time to go to eat but I'll tell you
[37:14] what from that time from that very time
[37:17] my my tution was always paid at
[37:20] school without me paying a before we
[37:22] even start the
[37:24] time until I finished school my dear God
[37:27] gave me a lifetime
[37:30] B if we go in the details we shall not
[37:33] finished but I would have loved to
[37:35] explain to you how I got the B and how
[37:37] my tution was being paid but
[37:38] supernaturally God showed me who will
[37:41] pay how they will pay and what they will
[37:43] tell me and those people for sure they
[37:45] wrote me they told me how they will pay
[37:47] how when they will pay exactly as God
[37:50] had showed me already in the Vision By
[37:51] Night God speaks God provides is Jehovah
[37:54] Gyra so if you believe in him always
[37:57] even before you go to Mommy or to Daddy
[37:58] to ask them I need this I need that
[38:00] don't rely on anyone I never accept to
[38:02] rely on anyone if you rely on some
[38:04] people they will forsake you I mean they
[38:06] will abandon you sometime or they may
[38:08] fail you and then you will you your
[38:12] faith was upon a person and a person
[38:14] disappoints you and then you you you are
[38:16] grieved with God isn't that unfair it is
[38:20] unfair if you hope the Bible says cast
[38:22] be a man who trusts in another man but
[38:25] you you are trusting in a man and when a
[38:26] man fails you then you again you you
[38:29] angry with God but trust God God cannot
[38:31] fail you you not even saying any amens
[38:35] is it because I said we having an
[38:36] interaction but I'm speaking the word of
[38:38] God okay if you trust on God God cannot
[38:41] fail you you you come to him you tell
[38:44] him I don't even believe my parents have
[38:46] money but Lord may you provide give them
[38:48] provide pray for them before you go to
[38:50] ask them and then see if God won't
[38:53] provide all right so don't be
[38:55] disappointed with God be disappointed in
[38:58] yourself that you do not have enough
[39:01] Faith to approach God in the in the in
[39:04] the right way but don't be disappointed
[39:07] also in yourself anymore because I've
[39:08] taught you on how to approach God and
[39:10] this problem will be over all right so
[39:14] we have another question here
[39:17] um how can I know God's Good Will and
[39:20] his permissive I he says perversive but
[39:23] I think it means pervis permissive will
[39:25] so that I cannot walk or do his
[39:28] permissive will very simple you can only
[39:30] know the will of God I think I answered
[39:33] that in the beginning you can know the
[39:34] will of God if it is the word of God if
[39:36] whatever you are going to do does not
[39:38] break
[39:40] scripture okay whatever whatever you are
[39:42] going to do when someone says H uh I've
[39:46] got you a job ah he paying you 2 million
[39:49] a month Hallelujah God has done it um
[39:52] but that job you are going to be working
[39:56] Monday
[39:58] to
[39:59] Sunday or rather Sunday to Sunday and um
[40:03] up
[40:04] to 88 to up to 6:00
[40:08] p.m. and uh it's paying you very well
[40:11] though but you won't get any time to
[40:12] come to
[40:13] church throughout the whole week you
[40:16] only appear when you are sick when you
[40:19] deceive them that you are
[40:21] sick let me ask you is that the will of
[40:23] God for you to do that job why why
[40:28] someone give them a microphone let them
[40:30] answer why raise up your hand somebody
[40:32] and articulate it properly for the
[40:36] people God bless you amen uh the reason
[40:39] is one you will not have time to come
[40:42] for Fellowship yes but also too you will
[40:45] not have time to pray or read the word
[40:49] of God yes so but how can you now know
[40:52] it cuz someone can say it's all right if
[40:54] I don't go for Fellowship it's all right
[40:56] I can go once in a while after all I I
[40:57] send my tithe so how can you can you
[41:00] convince them it's not the will of God
[41:03] yeah because if you do not attend
[41:06] Fellowship it becomes very easier for
[41:08] the enemy to help you backslide yeah
[41:11] yeah I I agree with you if if if you
[41:14] come to church at least because we come
[41:16] to church to hear the word of God to
[41:18] correct us and to rebuke us so if that
[41:21] is not happening with time you will and
[41:24] and what does the word of God say about
[41:26] a believer not attending church or
[41:28] attending church he said we should not
[41:30] forsake Fellowship thank you as simple
[41:32] as that the word of God says forsake not
[41:36] the assembling of ourselves together as
[41:39] the manner of some is if you want the
[41:42] scripture raise up your hand I'll show
[41:43] you the scripture by the way if I I
[41:45] mention some scriptures and you want to
[41:46] know where they are you raise up your
[41:48] hand and ask me I'll give you to you
[41:49] right quick so you see forsake not you
[41:52] want
[41:53] it you have a question yes yeah I've
[41:57] already answered ah okay give her a
[41:59] microphone okay my question
[42:02] is if I'm a
[42:05] Christian and maybe I'm I'm going to get
[42:09] married and there are two people brother
[42:11] a brother B all of them are in all of
[42:15] them love God all of them are Christians
[42:17] what they do is in the will of God but
[42:20] maybe God's maybe God has planned for
[42:23] brother B then for me I look at that two
[42:26] all of I within the will of God and I go
[42:29] for it to still be a permissive won't it
[42:32] still be a permissive sorry why would it
[42:34] be a permissive will when if you're
[42:35] going for brother
[42:36] a because if God has said it's maybe if
[42:40] God
[42:41] wanted brother B oh but all of them are
[42:45] within the the will of God they all good
[42:48] then for me they're all believers yes
[42:50] yes they are all believers and you just
[42:53] decide to choose the other one that you
[42:55] like better than the one that God told
[42:56] you
[43:01] God has not told you it is B but it is
[43:04] your choice so how do you know is the
[43:06] will of God all right that is a very
[43:09] good one as well okay if that the
[43:12] question is in that perspective then I
[43:13] will answer it this way I read you a
[43:15] quote right quick here let me find it it
[43:17] says that um
[43:20] [Music]
[43:30] okay all right let me find
[43:34] uh uh the answer for you here where it
[43:39] says the will of
[43:42] God in
[43:49] important it do anybody know the quot
[43:51] I'm looking
[43:54] for all right I've got it uh questions
[43:57] and answers
[43:59] 1961 uh question 163 brother bam was
[44:03] asked how do you feel is the best way to
[44:06] find the Lord how do you feel is the
[44:07] best way to find the Lord's will in some
[44:10] important matters and by the way this is
[44:12] a very good question for the young
[44:15] people because there are many things you
[44:18] you you you are you feel to do should I
[44:21] do this or I should do that should I do
[44:23] this or should do that both of them are
[44:24] good but you don't know what God wants
[44:26] you to do right how many have
[44:27] experienced that no
[44:30] one uhhuh yes now we are talking now you
[44:33] have to respond to me we we we are
[44:36] brother de if you see someone fainting
[44:38] call them outside give them something
[44:39] and then they come back because we want
[44:41] to finish 1 hour
[44:44] okay the answer I tell you dear
[44:47] friend the best way to find the will of
[44:50] God in some important matter matters is
[44:53] prayer okay now prayer and then he goes
[44:57] ahead to explain now here's a wonderful
[45:00] little thing here if you have a matter
[45:02] that's very important now here is a way
[45:04] I do it now he gives his own example I
[45:06] take it before the Lord and it's always
[45:08] been my strength I wait wait upon the
[45:12] Lord and see what he says because for
[45:15] him God deals or was dealing with him
[45:17] through Visions he would see a vision
[45:18] and he would know ah God wants me to to
[45:20] do that and I just let myself neutral to
[45:23] itat but many of you go to prayer when
[45:25] you already know God me I love brothers
[45:27] so and so may I love sister so and so oh
[45:29] God may you may you may you speak to me
[45:31] about her about him no God will never
[45:34] speak to you like that because you are
[45:35] not neutral you see he says I just let
[45:38] myself neutral to eat I I don't care I
[45:40] don't take either side and say now
[45:42] heavenly father now because now in my
[45:45] case most of the time if it's very
[45:46] important I wait on a
[45:48] vision but many people God doesn't deal
[45:51] with with Invision so there I wouldn't
[45:54] advise you to do that I wouldn't advise
[45:56] you to always wait on a vision or always
[45:58] wait on a dream I've not seen any dream
[46:00] I've not seen any Vision it may never
[46:02] come because if God is not dealing with
[46:04] you in visions and dreams and on other
[46:05] things you are doing in your life why
[46:07] will he deal with you in a vision and in
[46:09] a dream in this issue you get the point
[46:11] every one of of us has a way God deals
[46:13] with what with them so therefore I
[46:16] wouldn't advise you to do that because
[46:17] it's just some people that has visions
[46:19] and some does have something else okay
[46:22] where you do something else that I
[46:23] couldn't do or maybe your way of serving
[46:25] the lord I do something that you
[46:27] couldn't do see God deals with us
[46:29] different and so I would I would if I
[46:32] was in your place I didn't have visions
[46:34] from before the Lord I would just wait
[46:36] upon the Lord and say Lord now you show
[46:39] me you show me which decision to make
[46:41] show me and then you you feel the way
[46:44] you feel led to do
[46:46] it let me just go this way then wait
[46:49] just a little bit pray a little more
[46:51] then wait a little longer and see which
[46:53] way which side you lean towards which
[46:55] way the spirit now the father in my
[46:57] heart you you know father in my heart
[46:59] you know it doesn't matter I I just want
[47:01] you to
[47:02] know to I just want to know what you
[47:05] want me to do about it now that's the
[47:07] way I do about meeting sometimes I feel
[47:10] kind of led to go this way or that way
[47:12] then I feel I would follow that way
[47:14] that's the way to do it because it's in
[47:16] prayer then you are doing the best you
[47:18] what you can and I believe this my
[47:21] friends as Paul was in the New Testament
[47:24] in the days going by he was between two
[47:26] Straits two
[47:27] road which way he should go and he
[47:30] started on the wrong road and he got a
[47:32] Macedonian call he was walking on on
[47:34] another road but God called him to go to
[47:36] where to another road and I believe if
[47:38] you are making a decision for God and do
[47:41] it the best that you can I believe God
[47:44] will correct you and you will see that
[47:46] you don't go wrong I believe God will do
[47:49] it how many believe
[47:51] that amen so that's the answer the
[47:54] matter put it in prayer wait upon God
[47:56] and if you don't have to wait on a
[47:58] vision or a dream or whatever some
[48:00] people God deals with them in visions
[48:01] and in dreams really but it's not a
[48:04] standard the prophet is saying it's not
[48:06] the standard which God has a special way
[48:09] you can know surely God has spoken to me
[48:11] or I feel to go this direction But
[48:12] whichever direction you feel you want to
[48:14] take just take it and uh after prayer as
[48:17] long as you have been praying
[48:20] neutrally now let me emphasize on this
[48:23] no those ones which have been down have
[48:24] answered them you are going to mix them
[48:26] up
[48:27] okay now if you've been praying and
[48:30] there is a this come come here stand
[48:33] here and you stand there stand there and
[48:35] stand there okay come come come quickly
[48:36] we don't have time now you are seeing
[48:39] this sister you your brother no problem
[48:41] you're seeing this sister you are seeing
[48:42] the other sister now you want to choose
[48:45] but you don't know the will of God you
[48:47] are saying but deep in your heart you
[48:49] feel you you want this sister but this
[48:52] one also you want but this one also like
[48:54] oh God which one now should I choose ah
[48:57] and then you go God you know I want
[48:59] sister B you know I want this sister so
[49:01] much but show me your will so you
[49:04] already choosing for
[49:06] God you get you're already choosing for
[49:08] God it could be a job also it could be
[49:10] something else you are not neutral so
[49:12] what you do don't come this side oh God
[49:14] show me about this sister speak to me
[49:16] about her say you have already made up
[49:19] your mind so don't do that come and be
[49:22] neutral you want to know cuz you don't
[49:24] know whichever side God chooses you what
[49:26] you are happy with it so you see God
[49:30] will not speak to you about this one
[49:32] will not speak to you about the other
[49:33] one but you'll be in the midd you'll
[49:34] pray oh God I'm I've left the other I've
[49:37] left the other but I just I'm here I
[49:39] want to know your will I want to know
[49:41] your will Lord speak to me I mean you
[49:43] press sincerely before God and what God
[49:45] does is he may show you a vision if he
[49:48] deals with you in Visions or a dream or
[49:50] whatever but sometimes you you may never
[49:52] see a vision or nothing which is
[49:55] actually many times you don't have two
[49:57] wait to see
[49:58] one H Believers these days they don't
[50:01] want to do anything without a dream who
[50:02] told you that's how God works you don't
[50:04] you need to wait for a dream many of
[50:06] those dreams come because you are you
[50:08] you are full in the stomach they are not
[50:10] even from God by the way sincerely many
[50:12] of those dreams are not spiritual dreams
[50:14] or maybe it is something you are
[50:15] thinking so much about and then you
[50:19] think then when you go to pray and then
[50:22] you sleep and then that sister comes
[50:23] when she's your wife or your brother
[50:25] when she's your husband ah God has
[50:27] spoken to me it is not God it is because
[50:29] your thoughts were all about that person
[50:32] and then you think it was God it wasn't
[50:35] okay so don't think about it that way be
[50:37] neutral pray wait upon God after prayer
[50:41] wait a little longer okay after you've
[50:43] waited you feel like sincerely God is
[50:46] pushing you this way you wouldn't have
[50:49] wanted but God is pushing you this way
[50:50] it's all right start it let us see how
[50:53] it will go start it cautiously
[50:55] prayerfully
[50:57] every step prayerfully don't just go
[51:00] prayerfully you move and then along the
[51:02] way God may tell you and I've heard many
[51:04] examples like that God may tell you no
[51:05] it is not this one it is actually the
[51:06] other one
[51:08] ah and then now you are wondering I
[51:11] thought it is this one God said no but
[51:12] it is the other one you see and then you
[51:15] will go with what God tells you cuz what
[51:18] God always speaks that's what one thing
[51:20] that I know God speaks God speaks if
[51:22] you're sincere God bless you if you're
[51:24] sincere and you're neutral in your
[51:25] prayer God always speaks and that's how
[51:28] brother bamas told us to find the will
[51:30] of
[51:32] God and the permissive will of God is
[51:36] when number one it's against the word
[51:39] number two God speaks against it and you
[51:42] still go continue um so that is usually
[51:46] a problem okay have I answered that one
[51:50] well how do you understand that you have
[51:53] seen the right person to go with in
[51:55] marriage someone ask this one I think
[51:58] it's the same question do I need to
[51:59] answer that it is the same right if we
[52:03] agree say
[52:04] Amen all right it's the same way you
[52:08] know the right person first of all the
[52:10] matter you take it in
[52:11] prayer and
[52:13] uh uh maybe one thing I can add is you
[52:18] cannot find the right person among the
[52:19] gods if you are sheep you get you can't
[52:24] find the right person person among the
[52:26] Gods when you are sheep I've pray that
[52:29] God showed me the other
[52:33] one can't God can't do that right it is
[52:36] just your desires and lasts but if God
[52:40] is going to show you somebody the right
[52:41] person he will show you the right person
[52:43] among his
[52:45] children amen that is one thing I needed
[52:47] to add and then the rest is what I just
[52:50] said okay what will happen to the body
[52:52] of Jesus after the a thousand years of
[52:54] Reign on Earth will it vanish away I do
[52:58] not know I do not know but uh I'll give
[53:01] you a scripture here in the book of
[53:07] um says then cometh the
[53:10] end uh let me just find it for you
[53:22] here first
[53:25] Corinthians uh
[53:34] um uh just a
[53:40] moment uh 1 Corinthians 15
[53:44] 25 uh okay we'll begin from 24 then
[53:47] cometh the end when he shall have
[53:50] delivered up the kingdom to God he's
[53:52] talking about Jesus the son even the
[53:56] father father when he shall have put
[53:58] down all Rule and authority and power
[54:01] where is that going to be of course
[54:03] certainly I believe that will be at the
[54:05] end of the
[54:06] Millennium uh for he must Reign till he
[54:10] has put all enemies under his feet The
[54:13] Last Enemy shall that shall be destroyed
[54:15] is death for he has put all things under
[54:17] his feet but when he saith all things
[54:20] are put under him it is Manifest that he
[54:22] is expected which did put all things
[54:23] under him that is accepted for him he
[54:26] has not been put under him in other
[54:28] words then verse 28 and when all things
[54:31] shall be subdued unto him then shall the
[54:34] son also himself be subject unto him
[54:38] that putteth all things under him that
[54:41] God may be all in all I think that that
[54:43] one answers all of it
[54:47] right okay if you feel it was not
[54:49] sufficient or you did not understand the
[54:51] scripture you can come meet me for
[54:53] further explanations okay
[54:57] uh this question says where does a
[54:59] person pay his or her tithe in case they
[55:03] are not settled in one Church due to job
[55:05] transfer in different
[55:08] places
[55:10] um number
[55:12] one do you have a church home do you
[55:15] have a home
[55:16] Church no matter where you go to work
[55:19] cuz you can be going to work in many
[55:21] places like you have said here it
[55:23] doesn't mean that your father and your
[55:26] your mother has changed because you are
[55:27] now going to many places does it mean
[55:30] that if you have a home you have a what
[55:33] a home east and west but home is what
[55:36] home is best so it doesn't matter where
[55:38] you go for work cuz you're going here
[55:40] you are going there you going here you
[55:41] going there but you know that I have a
[55:43] home and I'm still going to go back to
[55:46] my home church then you still continue
[55:48] paying tithe to your home church I
[55:51] believe that but in some instances where
[55:55] for example you might find
[55:57] that uh you you now shift and uh you go
[56:02] to a place and uh you are going to be
[56:07] there indefinitely Or you have a
[56:08] permanent job in a a location that uh uh
[56:13] you're going to stay there for a few
[56:15] years and maybe you don't know even if
[56:16] you'll ever go back home you no longer
[56:18] attend church in your home Church you no
[56:20] longer uh get spiritual nourishment from
[56:23] your home church but you have found
[56:25] another church where you are you are now
[56:26] fellowshipping at I I would think it is
[56:29] right for you to pay tithe where you're
[56:31] fellowshipping at because you find
[56:35] people and this happens a lot especially
[56:37] in the churches here in the city you
[56:38] find people they are coming from Caba
[56:41] Mido they are working here in campala
[56:44] but um uh you know then they go back
[56:48] they come they go back they come but
[56:51] because they think that they are part of
[56:53] the church in campala they no longer
[56:55] send their tith back home and yet they
[56:57] go back home every 6 months or everyone
[57:00] but if someone has moved permanently
[57:02] here and you know starting life here and
[57:05] you are deceiving yourself to be sending
[57:07] money every time home because it is your
[57:09] church no you've really changed the
[57:11] fellowship because you pay tithe in the
[57:15] storehouse that's the clue there you pay
[57:18] tithe where Malachi chapter 3 you pay
[57:21] tie in the storehouse what's the
[57:24] storehouse where you get what
[57:27] food where you get food you know so
[57:30] that's where you pay your tithe from
[57:32] where you get your spiritual
[57:34] nourishment uh that's where you pay your
[57:36] tithe from I think there's nothing much
[57:39] to add on that one uh I hope that you
[57:43] young people that are moving moving you
[57:45] are going to to the Deacon if not please
[57:47] stay so you can get the
[57:49] answers brother Deon I think that
[57:51] brother is really dying he's about to
[57:53] faint you better take care of him okay
[57:57] now um someone asks what do these Bible
[58:00] verses say please quickly um read for me
[58:04] Psalms 127
[58:05] 2-3 somebody Whoever has a Bible open up
[58:08] open up and read it and then we shall
[58:10] explain it uh he says what do they mean
[58:12] Psalms 127 2-3 and Proverbs 24 another
[58:17] person open Proverbs
[58:18] 2433 to
[58:23] 34 Psalms 127 to 2 to 3 Proverbs 24
[58:28] 33-34 and we are getting late because
[58:30] the students now must go to school it is
[58:32] already 4 so I have about 20 more
[58:38] minutes
[58:40] yes okay put switch it
[58:43] on it
[58:46] says is it vain for you to rise up early
[58:50] to sit up late to eat the bread of
[58:53] Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved
[58:57] sleep yes L children are an inheritance
[59:02] of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is
[59:05] his reward I I believe the question is
[59:08] on verse two not vers on vers three uh
[59:11] it's about sleep because the other
[59:13] Proverbs must also be about sleep I also
[59:15] believe God gives his beloved sleep
[59:17] there are people who never sleep by the
[59:18] way when they go at night they have
[59:21] sleep problems if you are here and you
[59:23] have sleep problem problems you cannot
[59:25] sleep you need prayer and I'll pray for
[59:27] you and God will deliver you it's very
[59:28] simple God should give you sleep if you
[59:31] his beloved whereby you sleep and you
[59:33] don't even
[59:35] yes you are the one who asked this
[59:37] question but what I try to mean
[59:40] is uh there's a video I watched
[59:43] yesterday and it was saying that uh God
[59:48] provides to his children while they
[59:50] asleep and then that Guy brought another
[59:54] verse he said but another another Bible
[59:57] verse saying that when you sleep poverty
[1:00:00] will come like a thief yes so that's
[1:00:02] what I was trying to mean yeah Proverbs
[1:00:04] talks about that poverty will come like
[1:00:06] a thief not lacking sleep not not
[1:00:09] lacking sleep yes no you have to
[1:00:13] understand uh the first verse in Psalms
[1:00:16] is talking about rest God gives his
[1:00:20] beloved rest really remove the word
[1:00:22] sleep to rest they are not anxious for
[1:00:26] anything they they can rest okay at
[1:00:30] night God the Bible says he created
[1:00:31] night for
[1:00:33] what
[1:00:34] for for sleeping and day for work but
[1:00:39] you find people they are busy during day
[1:00:41] they also they can't also sleep during
[1:00:43] night they have to take sleep medication
[1:00:45] that's I always approach that verse that
[1:00:47] way to mean that we God has not given us
[1:00:51] a portion to suffer at night if you want
[1:00:53] sleep you get sleep you see for me I I
[1:00:57] believed that I've I always applied that
[1:00:59] upon my life even if I am not tired like
[1:01:02] some people when they are tired they
[1:01:03] can't sleep others when they not tired
[1:01:04] and they're Disturbed they can't sleep
[1:01:06] me if I want sleep I just go and put my
[1:01:08] head on the pillow and I sleep simple so
[1:01:11] the Bible says God gives his beloved
[1:01:13] sleep
[1:01:15] now uh Proverbs talks about
[1:01:19] resonance sleep there is talking about
[1:01:22] less not resting okay don't mix it up in
[1:01:26] Proverbs it saying when you are lazy you
[1:01:29] you are not wanting to work poverty will
[1:01:32] come and strike you so in other words
[1:01:34] don't be
[1:01:35] work when at night during daytime okay
[1:01:40] time is for what day time is for work
[1:01:42] night is for sleep so you cannot tell me
[1:01:45] oh doesn't mean now we shall be awake
[1:01:46] all the time we are working I'm working
[1:01:48] during night and day because I don't
[1:01:50] want to be poor no but of course rich
[1:01:53] people don't sleep much that one
[1:01:56] know so if you want to be rich you
[1:01:59] should not sleep a lot some people who
[1:02:01] enjoy sleep they become very poor don't
[1:02:05] abuse sleep sleep reasonably okay sleep
[1:02:10] don't now some people sleep 10 hours
[1:02:12] imagine at your age and you're sleeping
[1:02:14] 10 hours and you expect to be rich when
[1:02:17] Pastor comes and yeah I receive it I'm
[1:02:20] receiving and I'm going to be rich you
[1:02:21] will be poor if you're sleeping you are
[1:02:23] sleeping too much reduce on your sleep
[1:02:26] you find someone sleeping during daytime
[1:02:29] and you ask them why are you sleeping
[1:02:30] I've seen some of these younger men why
[1:02:32] are you sleeping you know the Bible says
[1:02:34] God gives his beloved sleep and is's
[1:02:36] Ying during that time other young people
[1:02:39] are very busy going there to find what
[1:02:40] to do you you are Ying at during the
[1:02:42] time that God gives his beloved sleep
[1:02:45] that kind of sleep will make you poor
[1:02:46] you will be poor in fact read that
[1:02:48] scripture read read Al Proverbs because
[1:02:50] you want to see how the Bible talks
[1:02:51] about how poverty will come to you read
[1:02:53] it somebody you have it
[1:02:57] yes Proverbs 23 I believe it
[1:03:02] is 24
[1:03:05] 33 ah no one
[1:03:09] okay yet a little sleep a little Slumber
[1:03:13] a little folding of hands to sleep so
[1:03:16] shall thy poverty come as one of one of
[1:03:21] that Trav
[1:03:23] and th no let me read it again th what
[1:03:28] continue th what and an armed armed man
[1:03:33] let me read again poverty it is
[1:03:36] understandable poverty will come to you
[1:03:37] like a thief he saying it will come to
[1:03:39] you like someone who travels it will
[1:03:41] just come and snatch you a little
[1:03:43] Slumber a little whatever of folding
[1:03:46] hands you see he's explaining this kind
[1:03:48] of sleep is the one of what folding
[1:03:50] hands that's why me I'm I'm telling you
[1:03:52] and I'm encouraging young people to work
[1:03:54] when you go break off from school don't
[1:03:55] just go there and be
[1:03:57] sleeping at school studying the time let
[1:04:00] us just sleep don't sleep like that find
[1:04:02] something you can do if you have nothing
[1:04:04] to do come ask us for trucks and begin
[1:04:05] Distributing them in the neighborhood
[1:04:07] let people here and come to church then
[1:04:09] you working also okay but don't just be
[1:04:12] there sleeping
[1:04:28] they call it winter oh I've been waking
[1:04:30] up in
[1:04:31] Winter and then you sleep the whole time
[1:04:34] you know you just wake up you go for
[1:04:36] football then you come back and sleep
[1:04:38] you're going to be poor until you learn
[1:04:40] how to work so I believe that you should
[1:04:42] work always be focused and find yourself
[1:04:45] busy don't be lazy and I think about the
[1:04:47] tithe I also answered it correctly you
[1:04:49] PTI where you Fellowship regularly okay
[1:04:54] not where you visit for Fellowship but
[1:04:56] where you Fellowship
[1:04:57] regularly okay um why are sisters always
[1:05:01] misunderstood
[1:05:03] okay when we are friendly to Brothers
[1:05:06] some that they are
[1:05:08] dating aren't we supposed to have
[1:05:11] brotherly love when we
[1:05:14] talk it's all right let us hear Let Us
[1:05:16] hear this
[1:05:18] argument this sister is serious aren we
[1:05:21] supposed to have brotherly love when we
[1:05:23] talk
[1:05:24] allative the they say we are looking for
[1:05:27] attention from Brothers yet this is how
[1:05:30] we are like you say today about talking
[1:05:33] taking some of your father's characters
[1:05:36] why are women given so many
[1:05:39] rules so in other words she's saying for
[1:05:42] us we have taken our father's characters
[1:05:44] we talk a lot and now you you are here
[1:05:47] telling us we are we are what we are
[1:05:51] dating or we are seeking for attention
[1:05:53] now um this question
[1:05:56] is um brother are you the one who was
[1:05:59] telling sisters they seeking for
[1:06:01] attention you about to
[1:06:03] faint okay so um sisters are
[1:06:08] misunderstood now I want to agree with
[1:06:11] this sister but also I want to disagree
[1:06:14] with her number one I want to agree with
[1:06:17] this sister that not every younger man
[1:06:20] yes sister I'm going to take up for you
[1:06:22] now Brothers not every sister that
[1:06:24] smiles to you talks nicely means that
[1:06:27] they are seeking for
[1:06:29] attention by the way these days these
[1:06:31] brothers are also becoming something a
[1:06:33] sister smiles and then he goes to all
[1:06:35] the other brothers do you know the other
[1:06:37] sister so and so has interest in me who
[1:06:39] told you because the sister smiled she
[1:06:41] think you think that they have interest
[1:06:43] in you come on be respectful I I I
[1:06:46] shouldn't think so a sister can smile I
[1:06:49] also believe I always teach my daughters
[1:06:51] to be kind and loving and you know greet
[1:06:54] people with respect and you know it
[1:06:56] doesn't mean because you don't want to
[1:06:58] show interest someone good to say I'm
[1:07:00] fine I'm fine you're just running away
[1:07:02] because you don't want someone to to
[1:07:03] think that you you are showing yourself
[1:07:06] to and then you you greet people when
[1:07:08] you are running away no I don't think I
[1:07:09] don't believe that I believe that a
[1:07:11] woman should be confident but also with
[1:07:14] shamefacedness these days sisters open
[1:07:16] their eyes wide sincerely even if it was
[1:07:18] me and you open your eyes white to me I
[1:07:20] would think this sister has a problem
[1:07:22] the Bible talks about shamefacedness
[1:07:24] with and sobriety it is in the Bible
[1:07:26] you
[1:07:32] see
[1:07:37] brother brother and the sister is
[1:07:39] greeting you these days God bless you
[1:07:42] this is how Brothers do and sisters are
[1:07:44] like that brothers are looking
[1:07:47] down it is sincere it is the other way
[1:07:50] around there is something wrong going on
[1:07:52] by the way in the spiritual real there
[1:07:55] is a shift I don't know if you have
[1:07:56] observed it sisters are more sober and
[1:08:00] brothers are more shy yet it is sisters
[1:08:03] supposed to be shy and brothers sober
[1:08:05] there is a problem here brothers are
[1:08:07] losing their
[1:08:08] sobriety so so that's why you know the
[1:08:11] sisters are becoming like that but also
[1:08:14] there is this aspect of equality and U
[1:08:17] you know we can do what men can do and
[1:08:19] things like that and this has also
[1:08:22] spoiled our our women in our generation
[1:08:24] but I believe believe a sister a sister
[1:08:27] a believer of the message she should
[1:08:29] know her place okay as much as you are
[1:08:32] being talkative and friendly to a
[1:08:34] brother don't overstep your bounds or
[1:08:36] your boundary H you should do uh for
[1:08:40] example there is um uh a brother who
[1:08:44] came and was talk Talking being
[1:08:46] talkative to my daughter one of my
[1:08:48] daughters not the small ones the big
[1:08:50] ones so and um this brother was talking
[1:08:54] over talking uh and this sister realized
[1:08:57] there is a problem here there is a
[1:08:59] problem here this sister was spiritual
[1:09:03] but some of you sisters even when you
[1:09:05] realize there's a problem you're like no
[1:09:06] no problem we just being friends God has
[1:09:09] already spoken to you by
[1:09:11] instinct or by discernment and you are
[1:09:13] refusing to believe because you have a
[1:09:15] wrong Spirit on
[1:09:16] you and is called the spirit of last
[1:09:19] simple but if you are of God if you have
[1:09:22] the spirit of God and you're talking to
[1:09:24] a brother you can know that the brother
[1:09:26] has crossed the line or you can know the
[1:09:27] sister has crossed the line and then
[1:09:30] there you just withdraw you withdraw
[1:09:33] yourself you don't even need to tell
[1:09:35] them a brother you're crossing the line
[1:09:37] no just withdraw yourself and keep
[1:09:40] yourself and then I've preached here on
[1:09:42] the pull pit many times that uh Brothers
[1:09:45] don't give uh don't ask for sisters
[1:09:48] contacts and I mean it by the way and
[1:09:50] I've stood by that and I'll preach that
[1:09:52] until God reveals to me something else
[1:09:55] whether you do it or not that's up to
[1:09:56] you me I'll keep preaching it
[1:10:00] why and someone the other day asked me
[1:10:02] he said now there are some sisters who
[1:10:04] are group team leaders sister gud sister
[1:10:06] f
[1:10:08] sister kugon and others you know fib and
[1:10:12] others now they were saying what about
[1:10:14] the sisters who are team leaders are
[1:10:15] they not allowed to contact brothers
[1:10:17] please it's not the rules these rules it
[1:10:20] is not these rules you have to
[1:10:22] understand what I was saying read
[1:10:24] between the lines don't take the words
[1:10:26] otherwise you will shoot yourself in the
[1:10:28] foot I'm not saying that it is a taboo
[1:10:31] for a brother to contact a sister sister
[1:10:34] to contact her
[1:10:35] brother you've already heard it brother
[1:10:37] and sister if indeed you're brother and
[1:10:41] what is wrong with it is it demonic is
[1:10:43] it Satanic but where a brother or a
[1:10:46] sister whichever is contact you every
[1:10:48] morning and every
[1:10:50] evening how are you my sister how was
[1:10:52] the
[1:10:53] night how are you my sister how is the
[1:10:56] morning how are you how are you how are
[1:10:58] you how are you becomes how are you you
[1:11:00] realize there is a problem here there is
[1:11:02] something going
[1:11:04] on is a problem with this brother and
[1:11:06] then when you said the brother says no
[1:11:08] me I was just being very friendly to the
[1:11:10] brother or to the sister no you are
[1:11:12] lying you know there is something going
[1:11:14] on here even if me I'm a pastor now you
[1:11:17] are my daughters if I begin contacting
[1:11:19] you you that have phones oh sister I
[1:11:23] don't know sisters which are here oh
[1:11:24] sister how are you today morning oh that
[1:11:27] morning you tell me I'm fine Pastor God
[1:11:28] bless you and then when I do it tomorrow
[1:11:31] you say when I do the thir
[1:11:34] you when I do it the fourth time you
[1:11:37] even show your friend by the way Pastor
[1:11:39] has been contacting me every morning at
[1:11:40] the same time what is wrong you get the
[1:11:43] point because you know I'm married but
[1:11:46] these younger men you don't care because
[1:11:48] you know maybe they're interested in me
[1:11:49] say you behave as if you don't know but
[1:11:51] you know you see you know you know there
[1:11:54] is something going on and then at the
[1:11:55] end of the day they break your heart you
[1:11:57] say but me I was not aware you were
[1:11:59] aware from the beginning and he didn't
[1:12:01] come to inform the pastor you say so
[1:12:04] it's not rules it is to just know the
[1:12:07] boundary and not pass the boundary
[1:12:09] because if you pass the boundary you
[1:12:11] will end up in
[1:12:12] trouble and if you end up in trouble
[1:12:14] you'll be blaming the brother you'll be
[1:12:16] blaming the sister you be blaming me
[1:12:18] when people pass the boundaries on their
[1:12:20] own and then they break each other's
[1:12:22] heart I usually don't don't feel so
[1:12:25] sorry for them because they we Tau them
[1:12:28] if I had not taught them I I I will feel
[1:12:30] sorry but if they are well taught like
[1:12:31] people you are well taught I don't
[1:12:33] expect any of you daughters here to come
[1:12:36] here and say someone broke your heart
[1:12:38] how come how come they even accessed
[1:12:40] your heart mhm tell us how did they
[1:12:43] access it someone wants to break your
[1:12:45] heart for someone to break your heart
[1:12:47] they must find it and then they will
[1:12:50] break it so you are the one who made it
[1:12:52] too easy for them to break it keep
[1:12:54] yourself
[1:12:55] protect yourself guard your heart all
[1:12:58] right is that
[1:12:59] amen so I I I I also think that that
[1:13:03] there should be a balance to that it's
[1:13:04] not always that whoever contacts whoever
[1:13:07] it is
[1:13:09] a a bad thing okay just don't cross
[1:13:13] cross that the line God bless you Pastor
[1:13:15] is this war going on in Israel with
[1:13:18] Palestine just for a Biblical
[1:13:21] right and is it okay for me to be on the
[1:13:24] side of Palestine because all of the
[1:13:26] Palestines are not
[1:13:28] terrorists
[1:13:31] Hallelujah now whoever wrote this
[1:13:35] thing needs to be taught okay it's all
[1:13:38] don't laugh whoever wrote this they need
[1:13:41] to be taught okay and I don't have time
[1:13:45] to do the teaching here please come see
[1:13:46] me but I'm going to make a few comments
[1:13:49] now actually incidentally this question
[1:13:52] is coming at the right time there's a
[1:13:54] pastor who made me said I've seen you do
[1:13:56] these interviews I have he has a burden
[1:13:59] to do an interview he would like me to
[1:14:01] do an interview with him on the war of
[1:14:05] Israel and Palestine I hope I will be
[1:14:08] able to do itth if the Lord moves on my
[1:14:10] heart for that and see CU I can see
[1:14:12] there is a need for that I will even
[1:14:13] contact him today and I tell I'll tell
[1:14:15] him you see there is a need for it and
[1:14:16] we'll see how God will guide us on it um
[1:14:20] the the war between Palestine and Israel
[1:14:23] yes it is biblical okay okay anything
[1:14:26] that goes around Israel is biblical
[1:14:28] right from the first world war to the
[1:14:29] second world war to the third world war
[1:14:31] all the world wars
[1:14:33] are involving or they are going or
[1:14:36] surrounding Israel it's all about Israel
[1:14:39] it has always been about Israel and
[1:14:43] Christians are always supposed to stand
[1:14:45] with Israel because Israel is a nation
[1:14:48] of God regard regardless of whether they
[1:14:50] are believers or not okay they are the
[1:14:52] nation of God God blesses those who
[1:14:54] bless uh because the promise of God does
[1:14:56] not grow old or Decay or rot he says
[1:14:59] I'll bless them that bless you I'll Cur
[1:15:00] them that Cur you now we do not support
[1:15:05] the the killing of children and the
[1:15:07] killing on either side it's a brutal
[1:15:09] thing because not all are terrorists we
[1:15:10] understand but when it comes to Nations
[1:15:13] cuz you see let me let me show you
[1:15:14] something here Palestine is saying even
[1:15:18] when you see all those people in in
[1:15:20] Europe uh they have these placards and
[1:15:22] going around do you know what they
[1:15:23] chanting they saying
[1:15:25] from the river to the sea from The River
[1:15:28] To The Sea it is for Palestine do you
[1:15:31] know what they meaning the river they're
[1:15:33] talking about is at the end of Israel
[1:15:36] and the sea is at the end of Israel so
[1:15:38] they are saying Israel must be wiped
[1:15:42] out okay that's what they're saying that
[1:15:45] Israel has no right to exist Palestine
[1:15:48] in their chter actually they say
[1:15:50] Palestine has no right to exist as a
[1:15:52] nation I mean Israel has no right to
[1:15:54] exist as a nation in the mid in the
[1:15:55] Middle East for them they are saying it
[1:15:58] is the Europeans that brought them there
[1:16:00] and therefore they saying they should be
[1:16:02] wiped out they should be killed that's
[1:16:04] why recently they attacked and were
[1:16:06] killing they killed more than a thousand
[1:16:08] people just killing killing killing
[1:16:09] burning children you find a mother and a
[1:16:11] father you know a mother catching the
[1:16:14] child and and and the father catching
[1:16:16] the mother and the child and you know
[1:16:18] and then you find they have burnt
[1:16:20] them these Palestinians they came and
[1:16:22] burnt them and and then you find
[1:16:25] that they they rap the women and then
[1:16:29] after that they kill them they find I
[1:16:31] mean like things you don't even want to
[1:16:33] think of why because they for them their
[1:16:36] number one rule their number one idea is
[1:16:40] destroy Israel doesn't matter how you do
[1:16:44] it but destroy it so they believe that's
[1:16:46] why if you go back to the history I wish
[1:16:48] I had the time man this is this uh thing
[1:16:51] is interesting if if you go back to the
[1:16:53] history you realize that
[1:16:55] at one time Israel fought a war against
[1:16:58] all the Arab
[1:16:59] states all of them they combined
[1:17:02] together to fight against Israel but
[1:17:04] still Israel won Israel has fought Wars
[1:17:07] when they were even on their own when no
[1:17:08] one was fighting for them but they still
[1:17:10] won because God has always been on their
[1:17:12] side and then the other thing which I
[1:17:14] should also tell you is that uh you find
[1:17:16] that most of these terrorists are really
[1:17:18] hiding in Islam um but
[1:17:22] um they uh orig they are true origin by
[1:17:27] the way both
[1:17:28] Palestinians and um the Israelites are
[1:17:32] all descendants of Abraham how many knew
[1:17:34] that they all came from Abraham okay and
[1:17:38] it all started with Hagar who gave birth
[1:17:41] to Ishmael and Sarah who gave birth to
[1:17:43] Abraham and Abraham was a son of the
[1:17:45] promise and God promised them that land
[1:17:47] where they currently are and then the
[1:17:50] others the Palestinians they they came
[1:17:53] out from the Arabs like could say even
[1:17:55] they came out from uh from from hagga
[1:17:58] and Ishmael so you see and we uh the
[1:18:03] Believers of the Bible actually believe
[1:18:05] in the god of
[1:18:07] Israel so how can you believe in the god
[1:18:09] of the Israelites and you do not support
[1:18:12] Israel you would be a liar support
[1:18:16] Israel because there is a blessing for
[1:18:19] supporting Israel there is no blessing
[1:18:20] for supporting Palestine though because
[1:18:22] God told ishma
[1:18:25] your your son will live but he will live
[1:18:27] by the
[1:18:28] sword and that's why it is only those
[1:18:30] Nations that butcher people by cutting
[1:18:32] their necks off because it is in the
[1:18:35] Bible God spoke about it um so it's not
[1:18:38] about Nations it's about the word of God
[1:18:40] I would say so whoever ask this question
[1:18:42] if you want more details in history in
[1:18:44] the Bible and all that you can meet me
[1:18:46] and we go through the details
[1:18:52] okay I'm about to finish I have about
[1:18:54] three questions
[1:19:00] only my question is that is it okay to
[1:19:04] sing some songs that are entertainment
[1:19:07] gospel I mean that in some cases these
[1:19:10] new songs are gospel there is CH for you
[1:19:14] for yes is it
[1:19:18] aak what does she mean religious song ah
[1:19:21] s this is a new language you people you
[1:19:23] have this
[1:19:25] LS uh
[1:19:28] mhm I'm currently in a high school where
[1:19:31] it is compulsory for us to wear trousers
[1:19:35] because our casual wears are knee length
[1:19:40] we have to put trousers and Saturday is
[1:19:43] trousers and it is compulsory I have
[1:19:45] done punishments and next thing is an
[1:19:47] expansion expulsion what should I do uh
[1:19:51] simple uh the Bible did not say we
[1:19:54] should not wear that which pertaineth
[1:19:56] unto a man only with an exception if you
[1:19:58] are in school so whoever ask this this
[1:20:01] question there is no exception to the
[1:20:03] word of God he did not say if you're in
[1:20:06] school it's all right it's
[1:20:07] understandable no if you want me to say
[1:20:09] that I won't say it okay I will only
[1:20:11] tell you stand with the word and God
[1:20:14] will stand with you where necessary you
[1:20:16] can even change the school or you can
[1:20:19] begin by the parents talking to the
[1:20:20] administration sometimes you have even
[1:20:22] they have even involved us as pastors we
[1:20:23] come talk to the admin if they refuse
[1:20:26] then the only option is to change
[1:20:27] schools I had one of my daughters she
[1:20:29] was at this school and they were
[1:20:31] refusing her to keep her hair we have to
[1:20:33] change her take her to another school
[1:20:34] you see so the word of God we don't take
[1:20:37] it lightly we take it seriously uh and
[1:20:41] uh regarding these
[1:20:43] songs um you yourself you asking because
[1:20:46] you have a question about those songs to
[1:20:48] begin with and uh you know you see you
[1:20:52] hear the word CH I don't even know this
[1:20:53] song who knows this song CH for years
[1:20:56] How does it
[1:21:03] go you see you're even ashamed to sing
[1:21:05] it in church because I believe it has a
[1:21:08] wrong Spirit behind it I don't know the
[1:21:09] song for sure but um I know those like
[1:21:13] that song I was mimicking
[1:21:16] here they played it so much what is it
[1:21:19] what does it say
[1:21:30] sing sing
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:43] it for Jesus okay
[1:21:46] now I will say
[1:21:49] this usually it's not about the lyrics
[1:21:52] that when you talk about by the way
[1:21:54] listen listen carefully when we talk
[1:21:56] about other people going to do weddings
[1:21:58] here you need to know which music is
[1:22:00] acceptable as a matter of fact I'm even
[1:22:01] intending that we shall have our own
[1:22:04] Brothers working on that music because
[1:22:06] you're going to have spirits come in our
[1:22:09] children pick pick them and they begin
[1:22:11] you know and those P when someone picks
[1:22:13] it they have it for life now you are
[1:22:15] hearing little children beginning
[1:22:17] Che you see they already picking those
[1:22:20] Spirits now listen with songs it is
[1:22:23] three things number one
[1:22:25] the lyrics okay what makes a song a
[1:22:27] gospel song number one the lyrics what
[1:22:30] do I mean by lyrics some people don't
[1:22:32] understand do you know what I mean by
[1:22:34] lyrics the other brother is looking down
[1:22:36] yet I was asking him which means he did
[1:22:38] not understand so lyrics means words the
[1:22:42] words of the song okay what does it say
[1:22:46] that is the first thing that makes it
[1:22:48] gospel but it's not the only
[1:22:50] thing the other thing is the the beat
[1:22:55] the beat there are Beats you can hear
[1:22:57] even on some for example like
[1:23:00] yesterday I was with my boy Ed where is
[1:23:03] Ed he was SE here comfortably as if he
[1:23:05] was hearing and he asked me is he I
[1:23:08] wanted you to see him he's very small
[1:23:10] but he asked me uh you know when they
[1:23:13] put on the song He was going to begin
[1:23:15] singing I saw him was going to begin and
[1:23:16] then he stopped asked daddy is that a
[1:23:18] good
[1:23:20] song and and and the sisters the sister
[1:23:25] also told the DJ to remove it so I had
[1:23:27] the MC telling the DJ ah that one they
[1:23:30] have refused to remove it what was it
[1:23:32] Jerusalem
[1:23:38] okay you have heard that song and many
[1:23:41] of you think it is a gospel song it is
[1:23:42] not it is not did you know that it is
[1:23:47] not it is a a secular
[1:23:50] song you go and make your research okay
[1:23:54] because you're here in Jerusalem it
[1:23:56] doesn't mean it is what a gospel song
[1:23:58] It's a secular song even the Believers
[1:24:00] refus it the spirit in the boy of three
[1:24:02] years had already refused it and he was
[1:24:04] like this already had started and I told
[1:24:06] him me I had not even realized the song
[1:24:09] so I was presuming that every song they
[1:24:11] playing is a good song so I told him it
[1:24:13] is good so he doed again but he said
[1:24:15] dadd are you sure it is a good song I
[1:24:17] said wait when I heard it said no it is
[1:24:20] not a good song my boy it is not so what
[1:24:23] am I saying that uh the other thing is
[1:24:26] the is the the tune of the song The
[1:24:29] Spirit of the song the people who sang
[1:24:32] the song also It Matters by the way even
[1:24:34] if they are not Believers of the message
[1:24:36] what Spirit were they in you understand
[1:24:39] now because like a du or because um who
[1:24:43] do we have here Chon because cedon now
[1:24:45] sings a gospel song We Don't so- called
[1:24:48] gospel it doesn't become gospel and we
[1:24:49] sing it in church you understand who is
[1:24:53] he he's not even born again you
[1:24:55] understand so someone who is not born
[1:24:57] again I wouldn't think that you know God
[1:25:00] would take them God would bring my food
[1:25:03] through them we have better sources so I
[1:25:06] would say we sing songs of Judith here
[1:25:09] she's not a believer of the message but
[1:25:11] you can see sincerely that she was being
[1:25:13] moved by the spirit and she was at the
[1:25:15] time also still in the spirit when she
[1:25:18] came out of the spirit don't you see the
[1:25:19] song she's singing have you not seen
[1:25:22] them they are completely secular you
[1:25:25] know and you can't even sing them even
[1:25:27] if they are so- called gospel they
[1:25:29] secular we can't sing them at all so you
[1:25:31] can see that some of those songs are
[1:25:36] not uh spiritual songs for conception of
[1:25:40] Believers I hope I don't find you on
[1:25:42] your own party in your own home on your
[1:25:44] own whatever playing some of those songs
[1:25:46] and then you are dancing CU you're
[1:25:48] saying it is religious
[1:25:50] songs we should do there we have real
[1:25:53] good dancing songs for believers do you
[1:25:55] know that real good dancing songs you
[1:25:57] don't even have to sing hymns you have
[1:26:00] many songs you see and whoever whatever
[1:26:03] anybody sings or writes as long as it is
[1:26:05] spiritual it is from my God the words
[1:26:08] are perfectly agreeing with the word
[1:26:09] some even some religious songs are not
[1:26:11] ours by the way you hear the words
[1:26:14] they're not connecting you leave that
[1:26:16] one as long as the words are right the
[1:26:19] spirit behind it is right the person
[1:26:21] singing it is in the spirit then that
[1:26:23] one is my song
[1:26:25] so songs are very very cautious we have
[1:26:27] to really be cautious about those things
[1:26:28] all right uh God bless you I have been
[1:26:31] having vision of a clock that shows me
[1:26:33] some minutes before midnight and some
[1:26:36] minutes after midnight kindly advise me
[1:26:38] on the vision I do not know how to
[1:26:40] advise you on that Vision but what I can
[1:26:42] say is H because you see now when you
[1:26:44] say Vision I also don't know the details
[1:26:48] was it a vision or it was a dream number
[1:26:50] one number
[1:26:51] two when the things why is very
[1:26:54] sensitive is When someone tells you what
[1:26:56] they have been seeing and they leave out
[1:26:58] some details you cannot know the entire
[1:27:00] meaning of the whole thing so uh it's
[1:27:03] difficult to interpret them but if I
[1:27:05] take this in the scripture I can only
[1:27:08] tell you that the the Bible talks about
[1:27:12] the cry that went out in the middle of
[1:27:14] the night you remember that that that is
[1:27:17] in the Book of Matthew it is talking
[1:27:18] about uh the coming of the bridegroom in
[1:27:22] the middle of the night that was
[1:27:23] midnight actually so what was it it was
[1:27:26] the coming of the bridegroom so I would
[1:27:28] say perhaps this this question is
[1:27:31] connected to Israel showing that our
[1:27:33] time as Gentiles is really coming to an
[1:27:35] end and the Rapture is very
[1:27:37] soon okay so is it okay for a Believer
[1:27:40] to use hble medicines for
[1:27:45] showering nothing wrong with it as far
[1:27:47] as I know nothing wrong with it as far
[1:27:49] as I know but if that those H medicines
[1:27:53] are coming from
[1:27:54] aist that is
[1:28:01] putting
[1:28:06] huh it may not even be a problem that is
[1:28:08] a hble right yeah it's not um it's not
[1:28:13] about the Hub you take cuz I mean these
[1:28:15] hubs are all created for us it is ours
[1:28:17] whether you are drinking it or showering
[1:28:19] it there's no problem but what I'm
[1:28:21] saying is
[1:28:31] you know those things they add on it is
[1:28:34] it
[1:28:35] Traditions you know when you are
[1:28:37] showering you know say those words speak
[1:28:40] these words and look in one side don't
[1:28:42] look on the other side and also do like
[1:28:44] that make sure you do it at this time of
[1:28:46] the hour tie this on your
[1:28:49] mouth that one is the Believers don't
[1:28:51] use it's like a m how many know a
[1:28:56] M I don't know how to also say it in
[1:28:58] English these are traditional
[1:29:00] things Believers don't use a MBA by the
[1:29:02] way if you have been using a MBA or
[1:29:05] planning to use one may God deliver you
[1:29:08] in Jesus name a mum is not for believers
[1:29:11] because those things if you want soil
[1:29:14] you can it means that your body lacks
[1:29:16] vitamins and that's why you just go to
[1:29:18] the pharmacy take some multivitamins or
[1:29:21] take some um how do they call that
[1:29:24] uh there are some good things especially
[1:29:26] for mothers who are pregnant you know
[1:29:27] you take that and uh you're fine you're
[1:29:31] fine uh but uh those kind of things they
[1:29:35] take them in the shrines and then they
[1:29:36] begin making it with witchcraft adding
[1:29:39] witchcraft by the way there's a
[1:29:40] difference between HS that are not
[1:29:43] witchcraft and HS that are connected
[1:29:45] with witchcraft there's a difference and
[1:29:48] I believe that using hubs or Hub
[1:29:50] medicine or hubs that are not connected
[1:29:52] to Witchcraft there is no problem with
[1:29:54] it as a matter of fact all medicine is
[1:29:57] HS
[1:29:59] doctor are you there is it
[1:30:01] correct yes all medicines is HS so it is
[1:30:05] not a sin to use HS for uh because the
[1:30:09] Bible says they were created for food in
[1:30:10] the Book of Genesis and if you want to
[1:30:12] shower itat different there is one they
[1:30:16] drink there is one they can just put
[1:30:18] there they boil in water and then you
[1:30:20] cover
[1:30:21] yourself and uh
[1:30:24] how do they call
[1:30:26] it huh you steam yeah you steam yourself
[1:30:30] you begin steaming there and then all
[1:30:32] fever goes now you find a Believer
[1:30:33] saying that is a sin a sin according to
[1:30:35] what I wouldn't think that is a problem
[1:30:37] but if you add your witchcraft there
[1:30:40] some words then it becomes a
[1:30:42] problem there is one
[1:30:45] likea for for malaria we had all that
[1:30:48] medicine
[1:30:49] before advancement in science I believe
[1:30:52] also Adam was using it like that animals
[1:30:55] use it did you know that animals when an
[1:30:57] animal has a problem it knows which
[1:30:59] which H to eat so it can get well you
[1:31:01] know because they in the wild no one
[1:31:03] treats them these ones which are in the
[1:31:05] zoos they give them our medicine which
[1:31:08] is
[1:31:08] a you know from science but those ones
[1:31:11] in the wild they know how to treat each
[1:31:13] other so it is not bad in my own way of
[1:31:17] looking at it to use hubs to drink for
[1:31:20] medicine for showering for whatever
[1:31:24] as long as it is not connected
[1:31:27] too yes
[1:31:29] please give them the
[1:31:33] microphone then there are these people
[1:31:36] who show our HS like to get blessings
[1:31:40] M that blessings come seeking for yes
[1:31:43] that blessings come looking for that is
[1:31:45] witchcraft to begin with okay that's
[1:31:48] what I said if it's connected to
[1:31:49] Witchcraft you don't do it
[1:31:52] okay I did not know know that you shower
[1:31:54] a h and someone just comes running
[1:31:56] literally running after you Believers
[1:31:59] don't use such kind of
[1:32:03] things there are some who sell tea
[1:32:05] leaves and they said that it heals like
[1:32:07] 20
[1:32:10] sicknesses well if you have the
[1:32:12] sicknesses and you want to take the te
[1:32:13] leaves what's wrong with it but H to me
[1:32:16] I would think that that is a a sales
[1:32:20] language but most of the hubs are
[1:32:23] medicine
[1:32:24] most hubs by the way are medicine and
[1:32:26] others are poison so you know some
[1:32:29] people they are born with a natural
[1:32:32] ability of knowing which Hub is what
[1:32:36] medicine some people know those things
[1:32:39] uh but um I think where you begin to
[1:32:42] take the hubs and twist it it's just
[1:32:44] like a Jaga how many know Jaga how is it
[1:32:47] called in English
[1:32:48] CU huh
[1:32:51] Cannabis weed
[1:32:57] huh
[1:32:58] sorry
[1:33:01] marijana yeah marijana Marana marijana
[1:33:04] Marana now that thing do you know that
[1:33:07] most medication comes from that a lot of
[1:33:09] pain medication has ner in it okay in
[1:33:14] doses so um most most of the HS are
[1:33:18] created for medication but you see it is
[1:33:20] this people who abuse it now when you
[1:33:22] take a Jag and You Begin smoking it
[1:33:24] sincerely you are you are a smoker okay
[1:33:27] you cannot tell us I'm I'm I'm smoking a
[1:33:29] h I'm fine no you are a smoker and that
[1:33:33] thing is going to hit your head and
[1:33:34] brains and it will change your
[1:33:36] orientation you will think in the in the
[1:33:38] wrong way and when you think in the
[1:33:40] wrong way you will do wrong things and
[1:33:42] when you do wrong things it will make
[1:33:44] you drunk and when you are drunk you
[1:33:45] will not be your own self it's just like
[1:33:48] someone who uses that Hub to say let
[1:33:50] people follow me you are just trying to
[1:33:53] be a
[1:33:55] and uh Believers should not Believers
[1:33:58] just should drink Christ Jesus and
[1:34:00] people will just follow you you'll get
[1:34:02] favor it's favor you can get favor if
[1:34:03] you drink Christ yes give the
[1:34:07] sister Diana God bless you
[1:34:11] yes ask the question about the the the
[1:34:16] vision but maybe I'll come to you
[1:34:18] because it just comes without any word
[1:34:22] it just tell me the time and then I also
[1:34:24] wanted to ask a question since it is in
[1:34:27] line um I we know that I I been
[1:34:31] listening to someone with a prophet and
[1:34:33] he says uh God doesn't deal with time
[1:34:35] because he's internal but uh in the
[1:34:40] dreams I'm given particular months and
[1:34:45] days but then they because me I know
[1:34:48] there's a part in Genesis where they
[1:34:49] said that uh that they I think the
[1:34:54] say that you will have the child
[1:34:57] according to the time of
[1:34:59] men and also there's those scriptures
[1:35:02] that say that seasons and times I think
[1:35:04] are for us but for me when I come I
[1:35:08] don't know whether
[1:35:14] they yeah continue okay so I I cannot be
[1:35:19] knowing
[1:35:20] whether it is according to the time of
[1:35:24] men or it is that spiritual time so I
[1:35:28] find that by the time when I see it
[1:35:31] maybe it's a dream and there's an
[1:35:34] instruction or something when I count
[1:35:36] according to this time of of men it's
[1:35:39] overlaps and I don't get it so I
[1:35:44] don't uh okay so I think we will uh we
[1:35:46] can take that up in person to find out
[1:35:50] because I would need to ask you a few
[1:35:51] more questions on that vision to know
[1:35:54] exactly if it fits in with SC the
[1:35:56] prophecy of
[1:35:57] scripture
[1:35:59] uh uh or not and what it could imply but
[1:36:03] I that it is connected to
[1:36:06] Israel and um the spiritual timeline of
[1:36:10] the of the Gentiles this is what we were
[1:36:11] just speaking about here during the the
[1:36:15] service last
[1:36:17] Sunday okay is it okay for a Believer
[1:36:21] okay now this person I would like to
[1:36:22] know who wrote this because she says or
[1:36:25] he says why does Rachel hate
[1:36:28] me now I do not know who said this is a
[1:36:31] personal issue and I'd like to know who
[1:36:35] wrote
[1:36:37] this uh you could tell us
[1:36:40] now or come to me
[1:36:43] later are you the one who wrote
[1:36:47] it why would you write something like
[1:36:50] this
[1:36:52] huh you were talking about it and then
[1:36:54] you wrote
[1:36:58] it no but you do
[1:37:18] not support football I mean um just to
[1:37:22] own a a football club and support you
[1:37:26] cannot own a football club because you
[1:37:29] don't own it you can't own it you lying
[1:37:33] yourself it is owned by whoever owns it
[1:37:35] and whoever gets the money those people
[1:37:37] make money out of this thing it's not
[1:37:39] just a game they make money and billions
[1:37:41] of money by the way out of
[1:37:43] it um but to us our source of
[1:37:46] entertainment is not football let me
[1:37:48] tell you this as Believers our source of
[1:37:50] entertainment is not football when you
[1:37:52] begin to see yourself going into that
[1:37:54] direction you just like movies you like
[1:37:57] football you know you like to go in what
[1:38:00] is
[1:38:03] this you know these days they watch
[1:38:05] football in bars you go in a bar you
[1:38:07] begin watching football the next thing
[1:38:09] you're going to be doing is what betting
[1:38:11] not
[1:38:12] so those those things come together it
[1:38:15] comes as a package love for
[1:38:18] football love for watching it betting
[1:38:22] and then poverty it is all entertain
[1:38:24] together and then back sliding before
[1:38:27] you know it you're drinking
[1:38:29] beer so and of course it also comes with
[1:38:33] groups and clubs and friendships and
[1:38:35] connections you meet someone you say oh
[1:38:37] this one is my brother we all of money
[1:38:40] you when you come to the word you are as
[1:38:42] cold as ice when you come to the church
[1:38:44] you are as cold as ice but when you are
[1:38:46] out there with watching football you are
[1:38:48] as hot as a a
[1:38:51] what as a call eh so there is a problem
[1:38:55] when you find a Believers and by the way
[1:38:57] this thing spirit is taking over some
[1:38:59] Believers we should shine those things
[1:39:01] because is we are not a part of it in
[1:39:03] the church edge book somewhere our
[1:39:04] Prophet says that U they are happy when
[1:39:07] they have their ball games but they they
[1:39:10] don't want us to be happy because of
[1:39:12] Revelation but for us we are excited by
[1:39:16] Revelation it excites us but when they
[1:39:19] see us excited they don't like us and
[1:39:21] they call us hola they call us bad words
[1:39:24] OD Ball but for them when they happy
[1:39:27] with their ball games so are you among
[1:39:29] them are you among them who are happy
[1:39:31] with their ball games me I am not I am
[1:39:33] among those who are happy because of
[1:39:35] Revelation I am starred up when I am
[1:39:38] hearing the word of God when I'm
[1:39:39] studying the word or when I begin to
[1:39:41] worship sometimes when I'm driving in
[1:39:43] the car and I'm worshiping or putting
[1:39:44] worship music oh begin shouting and
[1:39:47] rejoicing sometimes if you ever see us
[1:39:49] driving by you never that's why even I
[1:39:51] don't hear or see anyone on the road
[1:39:52] because
[1:39:53] we are always drunk when we are
[1:39:56] driving we we drink when we are singing
[1:39:59] and shouting and rejoicing and wo like
[1:40:02] like that you know the other day my wife
[1:40:04] said ah maybe those people are hearing
[1:40:06] what is inside here they are looking at
[1:40:07] us I said maybe but I don't want to know
[1:40:10] because I was drunk you know Believers
[1:40:13] are drunk by the by the word of God
[1:40:15] right by by by the songs of Zion these
[1:40:17] are the things which should excite us if
[1:40:19] something else excites you there's a
[1:40:20] problem with your experience for sure
[1:40:24] explain The
[1:40:25] Saga of Prophecy now I will not read
[1:40:28] this because this is not a saga number
[1:40:31] one now she says that uh I don't even
[1:40:34] know where you got this from young lady
[1:40:37] say that brother bam had prophesied that
[1:40:40] Billy Paul would go would be that that
[1:40:42] the Rapture would happen before Billy
[1:40:44] Paul brother bam did not prophesy that
[1:40:46] the Rapture would happen before B Paul
[1:40:48] dies that did not happen I don't know
[1:40:51] where you got it from probably among
[1:40:53] those people who fight against the
[1:40:55] message but brother bam never did
[1:40:57] prophesy that that this thing he never
[1:41:00] did prophesy it number one number two it
[1:41:03] is um the comments which were given
[1:41:06] about Billy Paul was Billy Paul telling
[1:41:09] his experiences with his father and that
[1:41:12] has nothing to do with the message or
[1:41:14] with
[1:41:15] us uh and unless you have another
[1:41:19] question on that I don't feel it should
[1:41:20] take our time there's someone having a
[1:41:22] head there a hand
[1:41:26] rather I had a question on the
[1:41:29] past past view uh which was about
[1:41:34] sports uh like in on our places at
[1:41:40] schools even at
[1:41:42] home like you know we have Leisure Time
[1:41:46] like you go and run run around to make
[1:41:49] the body flexible not to grow very fast
[1:41:53] um even like at school they can bring
[1:41:57] Sports time and you go maybe for
[1:42:01] football is it okay now uh food um games
[1:42:06] are not bad and neither are they a sinen
[1:42:09] if they done for the right
[1:42:12] purpose
[1:42:14] um running for for one is a very good
[1:42:18] physical exercise so I believe in being
[1:42:21] physically fit it's all right walking
[1:42:24] running but again you're not going to
[1:42:25] walk with only your pajamas because you
[1:42:27] are
[1:42:28] what you you like these people they go
[1:42:30] almost half naked so some of those
[1:42:32] things as brothers we don't even do them
[1:42:35] because of the spirit around them now
[1:42:37] like you go to play football everybody's
[1:42:39] having a short mij now you are also
[1:42:41] going there like that so that's why we
[1:42:44] don't what but I would imagine if I
[1:42:47] would call brother M and yourself and
[1:42:50] Brother Martin and a few other brothers
[1:42:51] here who are very good at football with
[1:42:53] say let us buy our ball we go there we
[1:42:55] do some physical exercises and we begin
[1:42:57] playing it what is wrong with it I would
[1:42:59] not think that it is it's a problem but
[1:43:02] where we are talking about commercial
[1:43:04] football um whereby it's for
[1:43:08] entertainment purposes for
[1:43:11] betting uh that I believe is wrong I
[1:43:15] believe is wrong uh you find yourself as
[1:43:17] a brother going to uh the football pitch
[1:43:22] uh uh with a gang of of people who are
[1:43:25] not even Christians at all what Spirit
[1:43:27] are you getting from there it's not the
[1:43:29] spirit of Christ certainly so it will be
[1:43:31] another kind of spirit so that those are
[1:43:33] the kind of things you would need to
[1:43:35] watch but football in itself or netball
[1:43:38] or volleyball in itself I wouldn't think
[1:43:40] it is a sin because if we had a school
[1:43:44] and we we would have those kind of uh uh
[1:43:47] activities I wouldn't think it is uh it
[1:43:50] is a
[1:43:51] sin uh so I think that's how I look at
[1:43:54] that I know there are some believers who
[1:43:56] when they hear anything football they
[1:43:57] think that is a sin out right you're
[1:43:59] going to hell but not that way not that
[1:44:02] way you need to have to strike a balance
[1:44:04] and to know what is wrong and what is
[1:44:06] not wrong because now I even see a
[1:44:08] question here is it bad to play phone
[1:44:10] games like matatu football Etc you see
[1:44:13] it goes back to what I was teaching here
[1:44:15] today if the moment you receive the Holy
[1:44:17] Spirit you won't be woring worried about
[1:44:19] the rules what can I do what can I not
[1:44:22] do what does the church accept what it's
[1:44:23] not about the church it's not about the
[1:44:25] preachers it's not about anything it's
[1:44:27] about the will of God in your life and
[1:44:30] when the Holy Spirit is in you he gives
[1:44:32] you a new appetite now I would wonder if
[1:44:35] the holy spirit is in me what would he
[1:44:37] make me do would he make me go to play
[1:44:39] games or like football on my phone would
[1:44:43] the Holy Spirit inspire me to play
[1:44:47] mat sincerely and is the holy spirit
[1:44:51] inspiring me ah Pastor come on are you
[1:44:54] saying that we should always be in the
[1:44:55] speed 24/7 someone asked me that
[1:44:57] question one time are you saying we
[1:44:59] should never have any games at all are
[1:45:00] you used to play matter by I don't even
[1:45:02] remember how they play it matter to is
[1:45:04] cards I don't remember how they play
[1:45:06] cards I would ask how many he remember
[1:45:09] oh no anyway you wouldn't even raise up
[1:45:12] your hands because you think they would
[1:45:14] think you are not spiritual but I
[1:45:17] remember I used to play cards I used to
[1:45:20] play dulu and a few other those things
[1:45:24] now what is wrong with d how many even
[1:45:25] know D
[1:45:28] here a few people here no D no that's
[1:45:31] not that is rud my dear that's rudo D is
[1:45:35] something else you just do like that on
[1:45:38] whatever some people don't even know it
[1:45:41] yeah I see sister Diana knows it very
[1:45:43] well so so dulu and other things we used
[1:45:46] to playay but you see the moment I
[1:45:48] received the Holy Spirit the desire just
[1:45:50] died if you ask me is it wrong I don't
[1:45:53] even know what to tell you I just tell
[1:45:55] you I don't have the desire for those
[1:45:57] things and if you can receive what I
[1:46:00] received you are desire for those things
[1:46:02] will die permanently that's what I will
[1:46:04] tell you you see so it has nothing to do
[1:46:06] with rules of dos and don'ts you see it
[1:46:09] is about the spirit of God coming in
[1:46:10] your life but the problem is when many
[1:46:14] people get an experience with God they
[1:46:16] want to uh Force other people who have
[1:46:18] not got that experience to act uh on
[1:46:21] what they do also as as a rule okay that
[1:46:24] is where it gets messy uh but I believe
[1:46:28] that you being now younger people you
[1:46:30] are here if I'm teaching you I'll tell
[1:46:32] you outrightly those Spirits are those
[1:46:34] things rather are not inspired by the
[1:46:36] spirit of God it is basically
[1:46:38] entertainment okay some entertainment is
[1:46:41] outrightly wrong and believer should not
[1:46:44] be engaged in it for example
[1:46:48] betting going out to watch football
[1:46:50] going in the vi vi do they do you still
[1:46:53] have
[1:46:53] B to watch movies these days they even
[1:46:57] have improved B they call it what
[1:46:59] theaters
[1:47:02] Cinema HH you find a Believer going
[1:47:05] there you are not a Believer you just
[1:47:08] joking no no no no no going there to
[1:47:10] watch
[1:47:12] oh why are you quiet do you do those
[1:47:16] things you would be cheering me saying
[1:47:18] amen say it preach it you're very
[1:47:21] quiet no believers wouldn't do such
[1:47:23] things you see H where you find them
[1:47:26] they're going out you know to to play
[1:47:29] football here watch football here go
[1:47:31] here in the world mix up with the World
[1:47:33] by the way me I even believe and this is
[1:47:36] how I raise my children I don't believe
[1:47:38] in mixing my children who are believers
[1:47:42] with the neighbor children who are not
[1:47:44] Believers I don't believe that you know
[1:47:47] mix them up go play
[1:47:48] together I don't do that and I believe
[1:47:52] it if it it applies to the younger ones
[1:47:53] it also applies to you the older ones
[1:47:56] they come with their own wrong Spirits
[1:47:58] they watch wrong stuff they they hear
[1:48:01] wrong words they they raised by parents
[1:48:04] who don't even know God and you who is
[1:48:06] raised under the word you go and mix up
[1:48:08] that's what happened to Ahab when he
[1:48:10] mixed up he ended up Maring somebody
[1:48:12] wrong or picking feelings for a wrong
[1:48:13] person same thing that happened to
[1:48:15] Samson you see those mixing and brother
[1:48:18] brother says God doesn't like mixers God
[1:48:20] likees
[1:48:20] separators so that's what I really stand
[1:48:23] for I believe we should be different in
[1:48:26] everything and you your phone if you
[1:48:28] cannot surely uh
[1:48:31] uh the other thing I would tell you
[1:48:33] about these phone games is it is very
[1:48:37] addictive I've seen people who play
[1:48:39] these games they even begin to detate in
[1:48:43] their way of thinking I don't know if
[1:48:44] you you understand what I mean someone
[1:48:47] is always thinking about the game even
[1:48:49] when they in church they are not in
[1:48:51] church their hand is playing
[1:48:56] you think they're sharing the word but
[1:48:57] when they seeing now they passing the
[1:48:59] game
[1:49:01] as and then he remembers he's in church
[1:49:04] he keeps quiet you see let me tell you
[1:49:06] this thing is so addictive I I'll tell
[1:49:08] you why I say that God by the way I
[1:49:11] thank God he took me almost through all
[1:49:13] these things so I can be able to tell
[1:49:14] you one day I was in Ethiopia and I
[1:49:18] wanted to uh we were always lining up
[1:49:21] for a very long time we get tired
[1:49:23] usually when we go to immigration to
[1:49:25] renew our residence IDs and permits so
[1:49:29] you would stand until you get one day I
[1:49:30] was there on the Queue and I saw another
[1:49:32] man cuz for us we would stand you do
[1:49:34] like this you do like that you squat you
[1:49:37] stand ah but one day I saw a man having
[1:49:40] a smartphone he was playing a game you
[1:49:41] know these bubbles these things you
[1:49:44] point and then you you fire at and then
[1:49:47] they fall down how many know know that
[1:49:48] kind of game yeah so I saw it so I
[1:49:52] didn't want to ask him what game is that
[1:49:53] because I did not even know at that time
[1:49:57] I mean I'd not been accustomed to
[1:49:59] playing those things I I wouldn't think
[1:50:01] I wanted to introduce myself to that man
[1:50:04] on that basis CU I was a minister of the
[1:50:06] Gospel so I just I just looked at him to
[1:50:09] see what kind of game is it and then how
[1:50:12] they call it when he was closing I saw
[1:50:14] the name okay I'll download it so now
[1:50:18] when I got the CH I began downloading it
[1:50:21] immediately and so fast to download by
[1:50:23] the way don't you don't even pay
[1:50:25] anything I have it I also started ah I
[1:50:29] enjoyed it I'm telling you even I did
[1:50:32] not even realize when the woman was
[1:50:33] saying yeah next please sorry sorry I
[1:50:36] didn't even realize that that I was the
[1:50:39] next one for a longer time until the
[1:50:41] person behind me had they had to all
[1:50:43] like shout hey please he I took my phone
[1:50:45] I put it in the pocket ah but I enjoyed
[1:50:48] that day because I did not feel the
[1:50:49] tness I was very happy so I said this
[1:50:52] thing will always be playing it in my
[1:50:53] free time so I continued playing it in
[1:50:56] my what in my free time when for example
[1:51:00] I am tired at home and um I am free then
[1:51:03] I pull it out I play when I'm on Long
[1:51:05] cues I'm standing waiting that was no
[1:51:07] longer a problem I was I had started
[1:51:08] myself I would just remove it and play
[1:51:11] now it reached a point whereby this
[1:51:14] thing went and embedded in my brains I'm
[1:51:18] I'm confessing these things publicly
[1:51:19] because it's the truth it reach a time
[1:51:21] when it was really on my brains I could
[1:51:23] literally dream it you see I could see
[1:51:26] myself playing it each time when I'm
[1:51:29] doing even other important matters you
[1:51:31] see sometimes this is very funny friends
[1:51:35] even you would be in church singing and
[1:51:36] then that game comes in your head I'm
[1:51:39] telling you
[1:51:41] yes when that thing happened one day to
[1:51:43] me by the way it's aad game why don't
[1:51:45] you play you know came as a voice why
[1:51:48] don't you play in church I said what I
[1:51:52] went back home I confessed to my wife I
[1:51:54] told her I feel that the devil is attack
[1:51:58] said this game I said because she was
[1:52:00] also tired of it she was always coming
[1:52:02] talk to me when I am wait wait you see
[1:52:06] so it was killing my family it was
[1:52:08] killing my marriage it was now beginning
[1:52:09] to kill the ministry H immediately I
[1:52:12] repented I told I confessed everything
[1:52:14] she prayed with me thank God my wife has
[1:52:16] been my pastor by the way so she prayed
[1:52:18] with me and then I deleted the game from
[1:52:21] that time I've been free I've been free
[1:52:23] so to some of you who have who are bound
[1:52:26] by these games you can also be set free
[1:52:28] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ it
[1:52:30] is a spirit which is Cap capturing you
[1:52:33] don't say anything else you are captured
[1:52:34] by a wrong spirit and you should be
[1:52:36] delivered I can only tell you my
[1:52:37] experience I can't tell you anything
[1:52:39] else I don't
[1:52:40] know all right you raising up your hand
[1:52:42] is it about the same thing okay there's
[1:52:45] a sister here right go ahead say
[1:52:48] it God bless you
[1:52:50] s uh me this question I think it was
[1:52:54] like a meeting like this when I was in
[1:52:56] Nairobi it was the youth meeting then
[1:52:59] they told us to write the questions then
[1:53:01] after I wrote so it was about church
[1:53:03] order in a young youth young people we
[1:53:07] then I asked Pastor that is it good for
[1:53:11] a brother and a sister to walk together
[1:53:14] in okay I brought it like in different
[1:53:18] sex to walk when he's a brother and a
[1:53:21] sister then the pastor me that as long
[1:53:24] as where they are going and where
[1:53:25] they're coming from so I was like H so
[1:53:29] it means I can walk with brother n when
[1:53:32] I'm from church like we are staying like
[1:53:34] in Chala I can walk with brother n and
[1:53:37] Chala cuz we coming from church cuz he
[1:53:39] brought it up like that as long as where
[1:53:41] you are going I'm where you're coming
[1:53:44] from so I was confused about that
[1:53:47] question so I need answer you you saying
[1:53:49] something on that
[1:53:50] thing after her
[1:53:53] favor I saw you raising up your
[1:53:55] hand okay so is it you are not con
[1:54:01] convinced I'm still perplexed about that
[1:54:05] why you didn't like the answer
[1:54:45] uh thing for you and the pastor looks at
[1:54:49] it that way we all have our own own
[1:54:51] opinions but must agree with the
[1:54:54] word so I would think I agree with the
[1:54:57] pastor walking with someone is it a sin
[1:55:00] it's not even for example going in a a
[1:55:04] car with
[1:55:05] someone
[1:55:07] uh you in public transport are you going
[1:55:11] to be seated only next to
[1:55:13] men are you have even learned that even
[1:55:15] in churches you
[1:55:20] find you can MI up what's wrong with it
[1:55:23] you
[1:55:31] see it's a good thing to me I don't find
[1:55:34] it as a
[1:55:35] problem I would not find it as a problem
[1:55:38] at all uh if someone listen the Bible
[1:55:41] says to the pure all things are pure if
[1:55:45] you are pure in your heart and you are
[1:55:47] going home and you find a sister on the
[1:55:49] road she's also going home you're simply
[1:55:51] going to walk talk what are you going to
[1:55:53] talk about the word of God and maybe
[1:55:54] other things in life or education or
[1:55:56] whatever it's your intention you don't
[1:55:58] have a negative intention
[1:56:04] say it's a thing what
[1:56:09] about so to me I would think that even
[1:56:12] if someone wanted to see they would not
[1:56:14] see in the open it goes to the motive
[1:56:17] that someone has if someone has a wrong
[1:56:20] motive they would always end up wrongly
[1:56:23] in what they do actually you will even
[1:56:25] restrict them from walking together
[1:56:27] talking together meeting together
[1:56:29] sitting together in church but they will
[1:56:31] find each other together somewhere you
[1:56:34] get so it's about the motive that they
[1:56:36] have restrictions in some scenarios they
[1:56:39] are good but H when they are overboard
[1:56:45] they they are not scripturally founded
[1:56:47] unless you have a scripture that thou
[1:56:50] shalt not walk with a brother
[1:56:52] alone on the
[1:56:54] road then I will agree with you but
[1:56:57] where I have no scripture to bind me on
[1:57:00] that I think I would agree with that
[1:57:02] Pastor that it depends on where you are
[1:57:03] coming from and where you are going yes
[1:57:07] um but generally speaking we we we we
[1:57:11] would we we advise against younger
[1:57:14] people even even if they're adults by
[1:57:16] the way find finding a woman and a man
[1:57:20] unmarried together alone in a private
[1:57:24] space and that private space is not only
[1:57:27] physical it can also be on phone you see
[1:57:29] I think that is wrong you find a man who
[1:57:32] is always married is the one writing
[1:57:33] younger ladies oh how are you my
[1:57:36] sweetheart oh my dear oh because he's
[1:57:41] older you think there is no problem and
[1:57:43] you as a a younger girl you are also
[1:57:45] very busy oh I'm fine and these days you
[1:57:48] call them daddy oh I'm fine Daddy ah
[1:57:52] you have no speed which is telling you
[1:57:54] this is
[1:57:55] wrong you're not answering are you doing
[1:57:57] these
[1:57:59] things it is wrong you understand so
[1:58:04] even physically me you can never find me
[1:58:08] in the in a private space with a sister
[1:58:11] being alone even I have these daughters
[1:58:13] at home my home my own home children
[1:58:16] that I can say they are my children you
[1:58:18] know girls you can't find me m they are
[1:58:22] they alone together in a room I don't do
[1:58:24] those things you see why is it mean does
[1:58:27] it mean something wrong is going to
[1:58:28] happen no it's
[1:58:30] just right way to
[1:58:46] behave so keep yourself guard yourself
[1:58:48] guard your
[1:58:49] heart not the right way so go I thought
[1:58:52] it was a very good thing to bring up it
[1:58:54] has helped me to bring up out these
[1:58:55] things but um so to me it's all about
[1:58:59] the private space keep that private
[1:59:01] space clear okay but if it's a public
[1:59:03] space and you're walking or going some
[1:59:05] other place or or you know I wouldn't
[1:59:07] think it's a problem at all okay it's a
[1:59:10] public space and you're walking or going
[1:59:12] some other place or or you know I
[1:59:14] wouldn't think it's a problem at all
[1:59:18] okay um and but again it goes back to
[1:59:21] your
[1:59:22] intention uh that's what God looks at
[1:59:25] why do women love money that's a
[1:59:31] question uh I will answer the question
[1:59:34] because in
[1:59:36] Genesis uh after the fall God told the
[1:59:39] man that the the woman that your desire
[1:59:42] shall be upon him okay so a man is meant
[1:59:47] to provide for the woman and a woman is
[1:59:49] meant to receive from the man so it's
[1:59:52] not a scene that women love
[1:59:55] money I have a lot of women in my home
[1:59:57] so I know that's why I'm protecting
[2:00:00] them so Brothers younger men work if you
[2:00:04] don't have money don't worry you will
[2:00:06] not keep that marriage I'm telling you
[2:00:09] brother Iranians work get money and
[2:00:14] build yourself a what a home if you
[2:00:17] don't have money she will stay there but
[2:00:20] she will not be happy H so don't think
[2:00:24] it is a sin you you wanted me to say it
[2:00:26] is a sin and I rebuke them I will not
[2:00:28] rebuke them you see it is natural thing
[2:00:31] for them to be provided and cared for
[2:00:33] and you as a man you have to work and
[2:00:35] feed them and provide for them and
[2:00:38] nourish them and then the other thing
[2:00:40] you sisters don't receive money from
[2:00:41] people that are not your mats or your
[2:00:44] parents it is evil it is wrong it is
[2:00:47] satanic it will bring wrong Spirits in
[2:00:50] your life
[2:00:52] one way to enter a man's heart or rather
[2:00:57] a woman's heart is to give them a gift
[2:01:01] if you read in the Book of Esther you
[2:01:03] will find in the Book of Esther that the
[2:01:06] Bible says uh the king would give after
[2:01:10] he sees them he doesn't like them he
[2:01:12] sends them away but how does he keep
[2:01:14] them entertained with what with gifts
[2:01:18] they even forgot all about the king as
[2:01:20] long as they had the gifts so sister if
[2:01:24] you receive that gift you will never
[2:01:26] know what it will end up doing in your
[2:01:28] life you can end up in a situation you
[2:01:30] never expected to ever be in simply
[2:01:32] because you accepted money from a
[2:01:35] brother and you saying it is okay
[2:01:36] because women love money even Pastor the
[2:01:38] other time said it is all right it is
[2:01:41] not all right for you to receive money
[2:01:43] from a man who is not your father from a
[2:01:46] man who is not your husband from a man
[2:01:48] who is not intending to Mar you it will
[2:01:50] cause you trouble don't say I never told
[2:01:53] you all right why do most Brothers love
[2:01:57] women who don't overt talk it leaves
[2:02:01] them the ones who are
[2:02:04] free
[2:02:05] sad I think the one who is writing this
[2:02:07] thing a
[2:02:10] sister uh if you feel that Brothers love
[2:02:13] the ones who don't over talk you stop
[2:02:15] talking
[2:02:16] also why why are you talking why are you
[2:02:19] over talking
[2:02:23] you know some women are very good with
[2:02:25] gossip it's it's not we don't like it
[2:02:29] I'll tell you that the truth men don't
[2:02:30] like it but also women are meant to talk
[2:02:33] you can't stop them but some others over
[2:02:35] talk really sister don't worry if you
[2:02:37] over talk God will bring you someone who
[2:02:39] likes
[2:02:40] it there used to be a sister I don't
[2:02:42] know brother are we still
[2:02:44] live okay I will withhold some
[2:02:47] information but I'll tell you this in
[2:02:49] Ethiopia we used to have a sister who
[2:02:52] was having a lot of words and all of us
[2:02:53] were concerned about it and uh I mean
[2:02:58] like very difficult
[2:03:00] for uh any brother to get to a brother
[2:03:05] wrote me he said ah this one you have to
[2:03:08] T her she has to be tamed she's very
[2:03:10] good but she has to be tamed I mean like
[2:03:12] she was having a lot of words I've not
[2:03:14] seen any of you have words like those so
[2:03:17] but God gave her a very good brother who
[2:03:20] Ted her very well you see but he loved
[2:03:23] her for her words and they mingled
[2:03:25] together
