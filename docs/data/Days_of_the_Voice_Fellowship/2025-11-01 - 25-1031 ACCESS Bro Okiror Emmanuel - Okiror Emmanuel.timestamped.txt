[53:04] others do.

[53:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:43] I am going. Surely
[53:47] I am going through.

[54:04] you.
[54:06] I am going [singing] through Jesus. I am

[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] Softly and tender,
[54:19] Jesus is calling,
[54:22] calling for you and for me.
[54:30] See on the
[54:33] He's waiting and watching,
[54:38] watching for you and for me. Come home.

[54:48] come home. [screaming]
[54:53] Yeah. Who are we where we come
[54:57] homelessly,
[55:02] tenderly

[55:08] calling.
[55:10] sinner come home.
[55:16] Why should we t when Jesus is calling
[55:23] pleading for you and for me?

[55:38] Mercy for you and for me. Halleluah.

[56:05] Jesus is calling
[56:09] calling. Oh sinner come home.
[56:16] Time is now fleeting. The moment
[56:21] are passing
[56:24] passing from you and from me.
[56:29] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[56:31] Shadows are gathering. This night is
[56:37] coming
[56:38] coming for you and for me. Halleluah.

[56:49] Come home.
[56:53] Yeah. Who are we? Come home.
[57:01] Hlessly,
[57:03] tenderly
[57:05] Jesus is calling,
[57:08] calling a sinner come home.
[57:16] Oh, for a wonderful
[57:19] love he has promised.
[57:23] Oh, promise for you and for me.
[57:28] Surely
[57:30] though we have seen as mercy and pardon
[57:38] bon for you for me.
[57:42] Halleluah.

[57:52] Yeah who are we come home. Oh,
[58:02] tenderly
[58:03] Jesus is calling,
[58:07] calling. Oh sinner, come home.
[58:14] Time is now fleeting. The moments are
[58:17] passing and they are passing from you
[58:19] and for me. It can't be that it's
[58:22] passing on from your brother or from
[58:24] your sister. It is you inclusive. Praise
[58:26] the Lord. Shadows are not gathering.
[58:29] This night is coming and if you delay,
[58:32] it will come for you and for me. Praise
[58:33] the Lord. But there's a wonderful love
[58:36] that he has promised and that promise is
[58:38] for me and for you my brother sister.
[58:40] Praise the Lord. Let us read in the book
[58:42] of Luke 5:E1 17 as we are going to share
[58:45] the word of God as briefest it will be
[58:48] or as long as it will be whatever the
[58:51] spirit will lead. Praise the Lord. uh
[58:53] Luke chapter uh 5 and verse 17-2.
[59:04] Praise the Lord. Uh Luke chapter 17
[59:09] and verse uh chapter 5:E1 17
[59:13] up to 25. And the Bible says, I don't
[59:16] know whether we're all there. We can say
[59:17] amen.
[59:19] Uh Bible says, "And it came to pass on a
[59:22] certain day as he was teaching that
[59:25] there were Pharisees and doctors of the
[59:27] law sitting by which were come out of
[59:30] the every town of Galilee and Judea and
[59:33] Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was
[59:36] present to heal them. And behold, men
[59:39] brought in a bed a man which was taken
[59:42] with epileps. And they sought means to
[59:45] bring him in and to lay him before him.
[59:49] And when they could not find by what way
[59:53] they might bring him in before because
[59:56] of the multitude, they went up on the
[59:59] housetop and let him down through the uh
[1:00:02] tiling with his coach into the midst
[1:00:06] before Jesus. And when they he saw their
[1:00:09] faith, he said unto them unto them,
[1:00:12] "Man, thy sins are forgiven thee." And
[1:00:15] the scribes and the Pharisees began to
[1:00:18] reason, saying, "Who is this which
[1:00:21] speakest blasphemies?"
[1:00:23] Who can forgive sins but God alone?
[1:00:26] Verse 22. But when Jesus perceived their
[1:00:30] salt, he answering said unto them, the
[1:00:33] reason here in what here, what reason
[1:00:37] here in your hearts, whether it is
[1:00:40] easier to say, thy sins be forgiven
[1:00:43] thee, or to say, rise up and walk. But
[1:00:48] that may know that the Son of Man has
[1:00:51] power upon the earth to forgive sins, he
[1:00:54] said unto the sick of the epileps, I say
[1:00:57] unto thee, Arise, and take up thy coach,
[1:01:00] and go into thy house. And immediately
[1:01:03] he rose up be before them, and took up
[1:01:06] that that where on he lay, and departed
[1:01:10] to his own house, glorifying God. Let us
[1:01:13] pray. Dear Lord Jesus, once I say I
[1:01:15] thank you for this scripture, we really
[1:01:17] want to commit this night and to thee
[1:01:19] Lord and the sharing of thy word. I
[1:01:21] commit even myself who standing before
[1:01:23] your children Lord for I do not have
[1:01:26] anything to speak before them but be
[1:01:28] thee Lord Jesus you come unto me that
[1:01:30] father whatsoever I speak let it be out
[1:01:33] of thy word let it be for the
[1:01:35] edification that father your children
[1:01:37] may grow spiritually strong Lord Jesus
[1:01:40] let them have a breakthrough through
[1:01:42] this night oh father I pray Lord Jesus
[1:01:44] Christ let it minister this word unto
[1:01:47] their souls oh Lord that father they may
[1:01:49] find peace of mind that they may find a
[1:01:52] healing of their soul. That they may
[1:01:54] have a breakthrough over every trouble
[1:01:56] that they are going through in this
[1:01:57] life. Oh father, I pray let the holy
[1:01:59] spirit come down therefore to minister
[1:02:02] unto us Lord Jesus that father we may
[1:02:04] hear from thee. In the name of the Lord
[1:02:06] Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. Praise the
[1:02:08] Lord. Praise the Lord. We may be seated.
[1:02:12] I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[1:02:14] Jesus Christ. And we are certainly
[1:02:16] thankful to the Lord for such a
[1:02:18] wonderful time he has given unto us and
[1:02:21] to come tonight to share and to pray.
[1:02:24] Just wait on him. Expect him to do
[1:02:26] something for us. Praise the Lord. And
[1:02:28] whenever you come to church, you should
[1:02:30] expect something to happen to you.
[1:02:32] Praise the Lord. That should be a
[1:02:33] mindset, a mindset and an attitude of
[1:02:36] every Christian that as long as I go
[1:02:39] into the house of the Lord, I must come
[1:02:41] back a changey person. Why? Because in
[1:02:44] the house of the Lord, there is a word
[1:02:46] that brings out a healing of the soul.
[1:02:49] Amid is all troubles. Because for as
[1:02:51] long as you pray that person, there must
[1:02:53] be a way God will speak unto you. God
[1:02:56] will lead a preacher to speak that which
[1:02:58] will bring a peaceful heart unto you.
[1:03:01] Praise the Lord. That which will present
[1:03:03] unto you all the promises that God has
[1:03:05] given unto us. Now we are read from the
[1:03:08] book of u Luke 5:17.
[1:03:11] Jesus is trying to describe uh I mean
[1:03:14] the Bible here is trying to describe of
[1:03:16] what happened in the city of Galilee.
[1:03:18] Praise the Lord. And today we are going
[1:03:20] to share the the text that or the
[1:03:22] heading that we are going to share is
[1:03:24] access. Praise the Lord. Or
[1:03:26] accessibility, access towards something.
[1:03:29] When you need something, you must access
[1:03:31] it by all means. Praise the Lord. But
[1:03:33] now the means that you access it will
[1:03:35] matter a lot.
[1:03:38] By what means do you access it? Praise
[1:03:40] the Lord. Let me first try to read
[1:03:42] something here. Uh just a little let me
[1:03:46] get it.
[1:03:49] To access is just like permission or
[1:03:51] liberty or ability to enter. Praise the
[1:03:54] Lord. Approach or to pass an uh to and
[1:03:57] from a place or to approach or
[1:03:59] communicate with a personal thing.
[1:04:01] Praise the Lord. It can also mean
[1:04:04] freedom or ability to obtain or make use
[1:04:06] of something. Praise the Lord. If
[1:04:09] something is present and there's a
[1:04:11] freedom and there's ability for you to
[1:04:13] do it, you ought to access and use it.
[1:04:16] Praise the Lord. And a way or means of
[1:04:19] entering or approaching a certain or
[1:04:21] cannot uh provide access to Praise the
[1:04:24] Lord. There's something here. It's the
[1:04:26] means of entering or approaching. Praise
[1:04:29] the Lord. That could also be the same or
[1:04:31] the act or the an instant of accessing
[1:04:34] something that you get into something
[1:04:36] that you desire to have. Praise the
[1:04:38] Lord. Now here the Bible talks about uh
[1:04:41] uh the the the man who came across uh
[1:04:45] Jesus Christ present in the in the place
[1:04:48] where he was preaching but there was a
[1:04:50] multitude of people who were gathered
[1:04:52] together with various reasons. Now it
[1:04:55] matters a lot the reason why you go to
[1:04:57] church. Praise the Lord. We can tell a
[1:04:59] story of uh John the Baptist as he was
[1:05:02] in the wilderness. John the Baptist was
[1:05:04] in the wilderness preaching the gospel
[1:05:06] of all good news to people and he was
[1:05:08] preparing the way of the Lord before he
[1:05:11] came into place. Praise the Lord. But
[1:05:13] many people came into that place for
[1:05:15] various reasons. Why? Because perhaps
[1:05:18] some had rumors that there was a man who
[1:05:20] was just putting on skin animal skin.
[1:05:25] There was a man who was just eating or
[1:05:27] just enjoying milk and honey. He was
[1:05:30] just taking only honey as his food.
[1:05:31] Praise the Lord. And he was preaching
[1:05:33] about a certain man, a gospel which we
[1:05:35] could not understand. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:37] And everyone desired that let me first
[1:05:40] go and see what this man was really
[1:05:42] doing. Praise the Lord. Now it matters a
[1:05:45] lot which reason why you came to church.
[1:05:48] Because the Bible presents us here the
[1:05:51] different categories of people who were
[1:05:52] present that day when the Lord Jesus
[1:05:54] Christ was preaching the gospel. Praise
[1:05:56] the Lord. He was performing miracles.
[1:05:58] And because the Bible tells us that he
[1:06:00] was there, there was a power of God to
[1:06:02] heal them. Praise the Lord. Now the
[1:06:04] Pharisees and the doctors were present.
[1:06:07] Those doctors of law, all of them came
[1:06:09] from different towns of Galilee. And the
[1:06:11] Bible says that Jesus was there
[1:06:13] preaching from city to city by that
[1:06:15] time. Praise the Lord. But because these
[1:06:17] people here had the desire to understand
[1:06:21] who Jesus was, they had a desire also
[1:06:24] after trying to understand him, how best
[1:06:26] could they condemn him through his
[1:06:28] words. Praise the Lord. So they did all
[1:06:31] their best. Wherever Jesus went, they
[1:06:33] were also present. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:35] Because the Bible tells us that these
[1:06:37] people were coming from different
[1:06:38] cities. Some were from Jerusalem, some
[1:06:41] were from Judea, some were from other
[1:06:43] parts of the other cities. Praise the
[1:06:45] Lord. They were all gathered for one
[1:06:47] common purpose. Praise the Lord. And
[1:06:49] they all come to Jesus simply to condemn
[1:06:53] whatsoever he was doing. And during that
[1:06:56] time, these Pharisees and doctors were
[1:06:58] from all those cities that we have
[1:07:00] counted. Some from Galilee, Jerusalem,
[1:07:02] and from Judea. And and there was a
[1:07:06] power of God that was there present to
[1:07:09] heal them. Praise the Lord. But there
[1:07:11] were people there were men who had been
[1:07:13] perhaps at home. They were trying to see
[1:07:16] a way of helping their own friend or
[1:07:19] their relative but they had no means of
[1:07:22] doing it. Praise the Lord. Perhaps they
[1:07:24] tried different hospitals. They tried
[1:07:26] different means of helping him. But this
[1:07:29] time around they had the one who could
[1:07:31] do it. Praise the Lord. But because of
[1:07:33] maybe the distance or the time the how
[1:07:36] or because one was sick they were just
[1:07:37] carrying him. They delayed a bit a
[1:07:40] little bit to reach earlier. Praise the
[1:07:41] Lord. And the Bible says that when they
[1:07:43] arrived, they reach and got that people
[1:07:45] were already packed. The crusade was
[1:07:48] already full. The building where the
[1:07:50] people Jesus was preaching from was
[1:07:52] already full and packed with people. So
[1:07:55] these people never had access on how to
[1:07:57] get into the place. Praise the Lord. Yet
[1:07:59] they in them they had a desire that they
[1:08:02] could enter in and take their beloved
[1:08:04] one to be healed by Jesus Christ. But
[1:08:07] there were people who were packed
[1:08:08] inside. You need to be very very careful
[1:08:10] brother sister. How you came to church,
[1:08:12] your motive and your purpose why you
[1:08:14] have come to church. Because these
[1:08:16] Pharisees who came earlier, they made
[1:08:19] sure that they on time. They were
[1:08:20] already packed inside. Instead of
[1:08:22] allowing people who had a desire to get
[1:08:24] something which was right for them, they
[1:08:26] had their own motive. Yet even the other
[1:08:29] people had a desire that their person
[1:08:31] will be healed. Praise the Lord. And
[1:08:33] these people could not have access
[1:08:34] because the crowd was too big. Praise
[1:08:37] the Lord. There was nowhere that they
[1:08:39] could pass. And because people were
[1:08:41] packed, people were very many and maybe
[1:08:45] many also had brought their their
[1:08:47] beloved ones who were sick. Perhaps some
[1:08:49] they had come by themselves. They
[1:08:51] desired that they could come and get
[1:08:52] healed by the Lord Jesus Christ. They
[1:08:54] came all together all long distances
[1:08:57] just to gather in that place until the
[1:09:00] place was full. Praise the Lord. Now
[1:09:02] these people they had occupied the seats
[1:09:04] and they needed I mean they had occupied
[1:09:07] the seats and those needed help had to
[1:09:09] take another access praise the lord they
[1:09:12] had to find a solution what best can we
[1:09:14] do in order to reach our person to the
[1:09:17] lord JESUS CHRIST THEY SOUGHT all
[1:09:19] possible means maybe THEY CALL ASHAS
[1:09:21] PLEASE COME OVER HERE THERE'S an
[1:09:23] emergency can we have a west and we go
[1:09:25] to the lord Jesus Christ they say no it
[1:09:28] is not possible praise the lord [snorts]
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; they could tried whosoever was
[1:09:32] available. Maybe the people were in
[1:09:34] charge of the church of the place or
[1:09:36] whosoever was possibly available at that
[1:09:39] time but they couldn't have access to
[1:09:41] enter through. Praise the Lord. Because
[1:09:43] everyone had his own idea why he was
[1:09:46] inside. The place was packed. Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ was preaching. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:50] Now these people had to deise another
[1:09:52] mechanism, another way that how can we
[1:09:54] reach our person to the Lord Jesus
[1:09:56] Christ. That was all what they desired
[1:09:58] in their hearts. They desire to have
[1:10:01] access. They desire to have a way
[1:10:03] through. They desire to have a
[1:10:05] breakthrough. They desire that how can
[1:10:07] we reach towards him. That was all what
[1:10:09] mattered to them. There was nothing
[1:10:11] which could matter to them. Praise the
[1:10:12] Lord. Now they could wonder that maybe
[1:10:14] because they are doctors of law. They
[1:10:16] are Pharisees. Maybe they will start
[1:10:18] condemning us. They will start telling
[1:10:20] us this and that. We have done things
[1:10:21] which are bad. Because these Pharisees
[1:10:24] after these people are found the access.
[1:10:26] Praise the Lord. After they had come in,
[1:10:29] praise the Lord. After the Bible says
[1:10:31] that they went to the rooftop up there,
[1:10:33] they went and opened the place where
[1:10:35] they could manage to lower down. They
[1:10:37] are person who had epilepsy. Praise the
[1:10:39] Lord. The man was sick. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:42] This man was was not able to walk. He
[1:10:45] was just lying on bed all the time. He
[1:10:48] couldn't do anything on his own. And he
[1:10:50] needed someone to help him. Praise the
[1:10:52] Lord. He couldn't have it in by his
[1:10:54] faith. He needed someone who could push
[1:10:57] him ahead. Praise the Lord. He needed
[1:10:59] someone who could do something who could
[1:11:01] take him ahead. Maybe perhaps he had a
[1:11:04] story. He had a testimonies of the Lord
[1:11:06] Jesus Christ healing all like kind of
[1:11:09] like manner of diseases. Praise the
[1:11:10] Lord. But he never had ability to go
[1:11:13] there. For a woman who was amid the
[1:11:15] crowd for what she tried to force her
[1:11:18] own access through because she had
[1:11:20] ability to praise the Lord. But this man
[1:11:22] was having epilepsy. He was just sick
[1:11:24] lying on bed. He couldn't do it. Praise
[1:11:27] the Lord. There was no access. The other
[1:11:29] woman who touched the Lord's garment had
[1:11:32] an access. Praise the Lord. She pushed
[1:11:34] through the crowd. She had the strength.
[1:11:36] She had energy to do it. Praise the
[1:11:38] Lord. And even we can see even the blind
[1:11:41] calling the Lord Jesus Christ as he was
[1:11:43] passing by. He needed that his son of
[1:11:45] David have mercy on me. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:48] He had ability at least to speak a
[1:11:50] voice. Praise the Lord. But now this man
[1:11:52] never had access. Even when people
[1:11:55] brought him in. Praise the Lord. Even
[1:11:57] when he was brought in by other people,
[1:12:00] there was no way to go through. Praise
[1:12:02] the Lord. And now these people had to
[1:12:04] deise a mechanism. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; For many years, Satan's through
[1:12:08] religious leaders have tried to hinder
[1:12:10] the move of the gospel of Christ. Praise
[1:12:12] the Lord. Because the Bible says that
[1:12:14] they are of the devil as they are father
[1:12:16] of the devil. Maybe we can read that
[1:12:18] from a book of John chapter uh 8:44 to
[1:12:21] 48. Can read it faster. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:26] Praise God.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; We need to be live. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't me to do because the spirit
[1:12:35] of sleep will take you up.
[1:12:37] Uh chapter 8 verse 44. The Bible says
[1:12:41] that
[1:12:42] yeah of your father the devil and the
[1:12:45] last of your father yeah will do. He was
[1:12:48] a murderer from the beginning and bought
[1:12:50] not in the truth. Remember that he
[1:12:52] doesn't desire the truth because there
[1:12:55] is no truth in him. When he speaketh a
[1:12:57] lie he speakest of the his own for he is
[1:13:01] a liar and a father of it. Praise the
[1:13:04] Lord. For he is a liar and a father of
[1:13:06] it. And because I tell you the truth
[1:13:09] here, believe me not, which of uh which
[1:13:13] of you com convince com convince me of
[1:13:17] any sin? And if I say and if I say the
[1:13:21] truth, why do not believe me? He that is
[1:13:25] of God heareth God's words. Here
[1:13:29] therefore hear them not because they are
[1:13:32] of they are not of God. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:36] Then answered the Jews and said unto
[1:13:39] him, say we not well that though at a
[1:13:43] samar town and he has a devil. Praise
[1:13:47] the Lord. That was a motive. That's why
[1:13:49] these Pharisees and the doctors of law
[1:13:51] were in in this place. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:54] For them they were gathered into the
[1:13:56] place not to hear the truth. But they
[1:13:58] have their own agenda. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:00] Because they were of their father the
[1:14:03] devil. the the they are father the devil
[1:14:05] is a liar. So they had to gather
[1:14:08] themselves perhaps had a meeting before
[1:14:11] they could go in perhaps they had to
[1:14:13] plan they had to do all whatever it
[1:14:16] takes to see that how could they trap
[1:14:17] Jesus to find a way how to put him down.
[1:14:20] Praise the Lord. So after they had
[1:14:22] entered in they were not after the truth
[1:14:25] they after condemning him. They after
[1:14:27] they were just waiting for a moment when
[1:14:30] something could happen that they could
[1:14:32] start murmuring. Praise the Lord. Many
[1:14:34] times even they could not even speak
[1:14:35] loud. They would just murmur within
[1:14:37] themselves. Praise the Lord. Something
[1:14:39] has happened. The man has been lowered
[1:14:41] down. He has got an access down. He has
[1:14:44] been healed. Jesus has told him to pack
[1:14:46] his bed and go home. And now they are
[1:14:48] wondering instead of perhaps wondering
[1:14:50] why they were able to break the rooftop
[1:14:52] for them. They were wondering why would
[1:14:54] he heal such a man? Praise the Lord. Why
[1:14:56] would he forgive his sin? Is he not
[1:14:58] blaspheming?
[1:15:00] Is he God to forgive sin? Praise the
[1:15:02] Lord. They were all trying to manipulate
[1:15:04] things. Praise the Lord. In order to
[1:15:06] hinder the move of God. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Now, there was a time when I was before
[1:15:12] I got saved. When we are still told
[1:15:14] there that we need to be very careful on
[1:15:17] on the religions which have come into
[1:15:19] existence, praise the Lord. We were told
[1:15:21] that please don't accept to be to be
[1:15:23] taken by those people who are called. Uh
[1:15:26] they will deceive you. They will take
[1:15:28] you into their things and and rob your
[1:15:30] money. they will do this and that to
[1:15:32] you. Praise the Lord. They were so
[1:15:34] careful to advise us not to move out of
[1:15:36] Catholic. Praise the Lord. They desire
[1:15:38] that they we could continue that we
[1:15:41] continue living in that very place year
[1:15:43] after year never to have access to come
[1:15:46] out. Praise the Lord. But because of the
[1:15:48] mercies of the Lord, he brought all of
[1:15:50] us out. Praise the Lord. Because this
[1:15:53] very people the Pharisees and the
[1:15:54] Sadducees and the doctors of the laws.
[1:15:57] These people always have desired to
[1:15:59] hinder the move of God. Even they were
[1:16:01] able to tell those of Peter go out there
[1:16:04] after weeping them never to preach in
[1:16:06] that name. They were trying to hinder
[1:16:08] every move of God. And today my brother
[1:16:11] my sister they still hindering the move
[1:16:13] of God in by their own means that they
[1:16:15] are trying. But I want to tell you they
[1:16:17] won't make it because God has ability to
[1:16:20] do whatever it takes. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:23] Now that was a man in the book of uh
[1:16:26] Luke that we have had uh that we have
[1:16:28] seen who had no ability to access the
[1:16:31] place of of relief. Praise the Lord. A
[1:16:34] place where he was going to get healed.
[1:16:36] And the people of the Pharisees also
[1:16:38] came around but not with a motive of
[1:16:40] getting healed. Remember the Bible tells
[1:16:42] us that there was power of God which was
[1:16:45] present that day to heal everyone.
[1:16:47] Praise the Lord. Everyone who was in the
[1:16:49] house whether he had a spirit of lies,
[1:16:51] whether he had a spirit of of
[1:16:54] fornication, adultery, whatever it may
[1:16:56] be, the power of God was present to heal
[1:16:59] all of them. But because they their
[1:17:02] motive wasn't right enough, they could
[1:17:04] not get healed. Praise the Lord. Now the
[1:17:07] people who never had access tried all
[1:17:09] their means and they were able to access
[1:17:11] the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us read in
[1:17:13] the book of uh John chapter 5 verse one.
[1:17:17] Uh book of John chapter 5. Can move
[1:17:20] backwards a little. Uh John chapter 1
[1:17:23] verse one I mean chapter 5 and verse
[1:17:26] one. From verse one
[1:17:30] the Bible says that and this day was a
[1:17:34] feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to
[1:17:36] Jerusalem.
[1:17:38] Now there is uh at Jerusalem by the the
[1:17:41] the sheep market a pool which is called
[1:17:44] which is called in the Hebrew tongue but
[1:17:49] the shed having five porches. In this
[1:17:53] lay a great multitude of important folk
[1:17:57] of blind halt
[1:18:00] withered waiting for the moving of the
[1:18:03] water. For an angel went down at a
[1:18:06] certain season into the pool, and
[1:18:08] troubled the water. Whosoever then fast
[1:18:11] after the troubling of the water stepped
[1:18:13] in, was made wall of of whatsoever this
[1:18:17] is he had. And a certain man was there
[1:18:22] uh which had an infirmity. Praise the
[1:18:25] Lord. An infirmity. And uh
[1:18:30] just a little
[1:18:34] And a certain man was there which had an
[1:18:37] infirmity 30 and 80 years. When Jesus
[1:18:40] saw him lie and knew that he had been
[1:18:43] now a long time in that case, he said
[1:18:47] unto him, wilt thou be made wall? The
[1:18:51] important man answered, "Sir, I have no
[1:18:55] man when the water is troubled to put me
[1:18:58] into the pool. But while I am coming,
[1:19:01] another stepped down before me." Jesus
[1:19:04] says unto him, "Rise, take up thy bed,
[1:19:07] and walk." And immediately the man was
[1:19:10] made wall, and took up his bed, and
[1:19:13] walked, and on the same day was and and
[1:19:17] on the same day was the Sabbath. And the
[1:19:20] Jews therefore said unto him that that
[1:19:23] was cured. Is it the it is the the
[1:19:27] Sabbath day. It is not lawful for do for
[1:19:31] thee to carry thy bed. He answered them.
[1:19:35] He answered them. He that made me wall.
[1:19:38] The same said unto me, take up thy bed
[1:19:41] and walk. Then Jesus answered, I mean
[1:19:44] then asked they him, "What man is that
[1:19:48] which said unto thee, take up thy bed
[1:19:51] and walk?" And he said unto and he and
[1:19:55] he that was healed was not wilt not who
[1:20:00] it was. For Jesus had conveyed himself
[1:20:04] away, and a multitude being in that
[1:20:06] place. Afterward, Jesus finds himself in
[1:20:09] the temple and said unto them, "Behold,
[1:20:11] though at made wall, sin no more, lest a
[1:20:15] wise a one thing come upon thee." Praise
[1:20:18] the Lord.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Then the man the man departed and told
[1:20:22] the Jews that that it was Jesus which
[1:20:25] had made him whole. Praise the Lord. Now
[1:20:28] we have looked at the first uh account
[1:20:30] of a man who was having ability to have
[1:20:33] people who were available at that time.
[1:20:35] Praise the Lord. This man here had the
[1:20:38] opportunity the first one who was sick
[1:20:40] of epilepsy. He had opportunity of
[1:20:43] having relatives and friends who were
[1:20:46] available to help him out. Praise the
[1:20:48] Lord. And because he was very far, he
[1:20:50] had to be carried out to the place where
[1:20:53] Jesus was found. Praise the Lord. And
[1:20:55] when they reached there, their faith was
[1:20:58] was really fulfilled as they expected.
[1:21:00] Praise the Lord. They desired only that
[1:21:03] if they could take him down, that would
[1:21:05] be enough. Whatever happens down was
[1:21:07] none of their business. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:09] Their faith was activated and they
[1:21:11] lowered the man down. And when a man
[1:21:13] reached down, God looked into their
[1:21:15] faith and told the man, "Your sins be
[1:21:18] forgiven." Praise the Lord. It was the
[1:21:20] sins which were to be forgiven first.
[1:21:22] And when the man's sin was were
[1:21:24] forgiven, even the epilepsy had to
[1:21:26] leave. Praise the Lord. Because when I
[1:21:28] pray for a person, sincerely praying for
[1:21:30] a person, a sick person laying hand on a
[1:21:32] sick person, even sins are forgiven.
[1:21:34] Praise the Lord. Because God forgives
[1:21:36] even sins. Now in this next account, a
[1:21:39] man who had a solution before him but
[1:21:42] never had accessibility to the pool.
[1:21:44] Praise the Lord. For he stayed there for
[1:21:46] a number of years sat 8 years but never
[1:21:49] had a way into the pool. Praise the
[1:21:51] Lord. The solution was near him was
[1:21:54] present was just in front of him for but
[1:21:57] year after year he couldn't access the
[1:21:59] solution. Praise the Lord. He just
[1:22:01] looked at other people go into the water
[1:22:03] because maybe they had a little strength
[1:22:05] to go through. Praise the Lord. They
[1:22:07] could manage to run because the water
[1:22:09] could be turned just trouble once for a
[1:22:12] season. So this man stayed for a number
[1:22:15] of years trying to hope that one day
[1:22:17] I'll be fine. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; He never lost hope. Maybe among them one
[1:22:22] of them left. Maybe as among them some
[1:22:24] of them quit. Some of them could have
[1:22:26] lost hope. But this man continued
[1:22:29] living. Praise the Lord. Continue
[1:22:31] staying within the place without
[1:22:32] leaving, without friends, without
[1:22:35] relatives, without neighbors, without
[1:22:37] anyone even giving him hope. Maybe even
[1:22:39] others who could have got healed could
[1:22:41] have said, "Please, we have stayed here
[1:22:43] together. Let me help you, push you a
[1:22:45] little." Praise the Lord. But for them
[1:22:47] also after they were healed, they could
[1:22:48] go. Praise the Lord. Because everyone
[1:22:50] there was there expecting to be healed.
[1:22:52] That was their aim. Praise the Lord. And
[1:22:54] it was none of their business to see
[1:22:56] this old man out. Praise the Lord. SO
[1:22:59] THIS MAN STAYED THERE having hope that
[1:23:01] one day something would happen. Praise
[1:23:03] the Lord.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; There was no one who was around to help
[1:23:06] him. Everyone after getting held walked
[1:23:09] away and he could not have access to the
[1:23:12] water. Year after year no help but still
[1:23:14] believed. Now when we read up to verse
[1:23:17] seven, praise the Lord. verse 7 the
[1:23:19] Bible says that uh the same chapter 5
[1:23:23] verse 7 the Bible says that uh
[1:23:28] uh the important man answered him sir I
[1:23:31] have no man when the water is troubled.
[1:23:34] Now this is Jesus now who was coming to
[1:23:38] into the place where this man had stayed
[1:23:40] for a number of years. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:42] Now when Jesus arrived into the place,
[1:23:45] he said that there was a certain man who
[1:23:47] was there which had infirmities 30 and
[1:23:50] 80 years. But when Jesus arrived
[1:23:52] immediately he rushed into this man. He
[1:23:54] did not go to anyone else. Praise the
[1:23:56] Lord. He just went to this man and say
[1:23:58] and saw him lie and knew that he had
[1:24:01] been now a long time
[1:24:05] in the case in that case and he said
[1:24:07] unto him, thou be made well? Praise the
[1:24:10] Lord. It was a question which was a
[1:24:13] simple which needed a simple answer.
[1:24:15] This this man now because he had stayed
[1:24:17] there for many years. He couldn't
[1:24:19] imagine that for many years eight years
[1:24:23] someone who could come and ask me such a
[1:24:25] question. What is this man trying to
[1:24:27] mean at this point? Praise the Lord.
[1:24:29] Maybe no one has ever come to approach
[1:24:30] him that way. For many years, no one has
[1:24:33] ever tried even to talk to him that way.
[1:24:35] Praise the Lord. But now this man is
[1:24:37] coming to tell me about the healing.
[1:24:40] Even the season is not yet. Which kind
[1:24:42] of hopes is this man coming to give me?
[1:24:44] Praise the Lord. That's why he answered
[1:24:46] and said that there's no man who can put
[1:24:48] me in. Praise the Lord. Because he knew
[1:24:50] the season would come, but there's no
[1:24:52] man who could put him in. Praise the
[1:24:54] Lord. Maybe he hoped that this man could
[1:24:56] come and put him in. Maybe the Lord
[1:24:58] Jesus Christ was going to do something.
[1:25:00] Then important man answered and said, "I
[1:25:02] have no man
[1:25:04] when the water is troubled to put me
[1:25:07] into the pool. But while I am coming,
[1:25:10] another steps down before me." Praise
[1:25:12] the Lord. Before he could get healed,
[1:25:15] another one gets healed. Praise the
[1:25:17] Lord. So this man had to continue the
[1:25:19] same cycle year after year. One year
[1:25:22] gone, he had to do the same thing.
[1:25:24] Praise the Lord. A second year at a
[1:25:26] certain point, he felt like it was just
[1:25:28] something normal to him. Praise the
[1:25:29] Lord. Maybe he got used to but a little
[1:25:32] hope continue keeping kept on him
[1:25:35] telling himself that I can stay here
[1:25:37] until I'm healed. Praise the Lord. So
[1:25:40] such a thing motivated him. He kept on
[1:25:42] hoping day by day. Every day that
[1:25:44] something will happen. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:46] The breakthrough will come. Somebody
[1:25:48] will have access. Praise the Lord. Will
[1:25:50] help me to access this water. Perhaps
[1:25:52] that was his hope. But I want to tell
[1:25:54] you sometimes that is the way how we
[1:25:56] think. Praise the Lord. We think
[1:25:58] sometimes that this is how God will help
[1:26:00] me out. Maybe you want to have a
[1:26:02] breakthrough financially. Now your mind
[1:26:05] is locked into money. That until God
[1:26:07] provides me money, that's when I will
[1:26:09] have a breakthrough. Certain ways God
[1:26:11] works in a way that we don't think.
[1:26:13] Praise the Lord. God can do certain
[1:26:15] things not in a way that we expect.
[1:26:17] Praise the Lord. Even when you're
[1:26:19] praying, God give me money so that I can
[1:26:21] do this. God give me this so that I can
[1:26:23] build a house. OR IF GOD CAN bless
[1:26:25] somebody to build for your house, hasn't
[1:26:27] it solved your problem? It should have
[1:26:29] solved your problem. Praise the Lord.
[1:26:31] Now this man continued waiting year
[1:26:33] after year. But he couldn't have any
[1:26:35] hope of anyone who could come. But now
[1:26:37] here appears the Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:26:39] was able to do a miracle to him. Praise
[1:26:42] the Lord. He was able to speak unto him
[1:26:44] just by word and he it was able to help
[1:26:47] him. Praise the Lord. You know in life
[1:26:49] that's where there are other problems
[1:26:51] that we face and our minds are locked
[1:26:53] into a certain solution that until this
[1:26:56] happens that's when this will happen.
[1:26:58] That's why there's difference different
[1:27:00] persons or group of people can access
[1:27:02] areas of interest but come out with
[1:27:05] different results or similar. Praise the
[1:27:07] Lord.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Some persons can go into a certain
[1:27:10] place.
[1:27:12] They are interested in a certain thing
[1:27:14] but they can come out with either a
[1:27:16] similar result or different results.
[1:27:18] Praise the Lord. While other people are
[1:27:21] not allowed to access certain areas and
[1:27:23] others allowed some are allowed to uh
[1:27:27] some are allowed to after uh some are
[1:27:30] allowed after a great investigation but
[1:27:33] others go through without any checking.
[1:27:35] Praise the Lord. Others have got the
[1:27:37] right to access certain places at any
[1:27:40] time while others do not have any access
[1:27:43] or hope to access certain things
[1:27:46] anywhere and any time they desire.
[1:27:48] Praise the Lord. Others can access at
[1:27:50] once and never hope to get again while
[1:27:53] others expect again and again. Praise
[1:27:56] the Lord. Others expect to go through
[1:27:58] certain places forcefully while others
[1:28:01] take close study before they get in.
[1:28:04] Praise the Lord. Others can access
[1:28:06] certain things due to influence by
[1:28:08] others and others can go by themselves.
[1:28:11] Praise the Lord. Others have got full
[1:28:14] authority to access certain things but
[1:28:17] do not care accessing them while others
[1:28:20] have had a desire. They have a desire to
[1:28:22] access a same similar thing that others
[1:28:24] desire but do not have access at all.
[1:28:27] Praise the Lord. Others are saying today
[1:28:29] is for so and so and I hope tomorrow it
[1:28:32] will be mine. Praise the Lord. You hope
[1:28:34] that today it is for brother so and so.
[1:28:36] That blessing is for certain so and so.
[1:28:38] Praise the Lord. That duty is supposed
[1:28:40] to be done by so and so not by me.
[1:28:43] Praise the Lord. But I want to tell you
[1:28:44] that all of us have equal rights before
[1:28:46] God. And when you desire something from
[1:28:49] God and you ask from by prayer, by
[1:28:51] faith, you ought to receive it. Praise
[1:28:53] the Lord. Because we serve one God and
[1:28:55] we have one faith, we have one hope, we
[1:28:58] have one love, one baptism, and
[1:29:01] everything is one. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:03] Well, now when you have such access, you
[1:29:05] have a desire, then why not let it be
[1:29:08] known to God and God will answer your
[1:29:10] prayer. Praise the Lord. Because
[1:29:12] sometimes the means may not be there of
[1:29:14] reaching the almighty. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:16] Because of maybe the hinderance of sin,
[1:29:18] maybe because of the hinderance of
[1:29:20] certain situations, maybe the hinderance
[1:29:22] of other people telling you that it is
[1:29:24] not possible for you. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:26] So we fail to access things while we are
[1:29:29] seated in our problems thinking that
[1:29:31] maybe it is for so and so. Praise the
[1:29:33] Lord. Others wish certain things to
[1:29:36] happen
[1:29:38] first before they can get something.
[1:29:40] Praise the Lord. Somebody will say that
[1:29:43] until I get married that's when I will
[1:29:45] start praying and fasting. Praise the
[1:29:46] Lord.
[1:29:48] Somebody will say that until I do this
[1:29:49] and that that's when this will happen.
[1:29:51] Praise the Lord. You keep waiting for
[1:29:53] certain opportunities to happen because
[1:29:55] such opportunities are not happening. So
[1:29:57] you keep pushing yourself into sin.
[1:29:59] Praise the Lord. You keep going deeper
[1:30:01] deeper into sin while hoping that until
[1:30:04] this thing happens that's when I will
[1:30:05] come out of this. Praise the Lord. You
[1:30:07] ought to have confidence and speak to
[1:30:09] the Lord and God is there to help you
[1:30:11] out. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; God is always there to stand for you and
[1:30:15] God is always there to lift you up in
[1:30:17] every situation that you're in and every
[1:30:20] moment that you're in. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:21] You have access to the blood of the lamb
[1:30:24] and of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible
[1:30:26] says in the book of uh Revelation 3:20,
[1:30:29] "Behold, I sound at the door at knock."
[1:30:31] Praise the Lord. Now, we are going
[1:30:33] deeper into the access how to access the
[1:30:36] blessings of the Lord. Revelation 20,
[1:30:39] chapter 3 verse 20. Maybe we can get it
[1:30:42] through.
[1:30:46] Revelation 3:20. The Bible says that
[1:30:50] behold I stand at the door and knock. If
[1:30:53] any man hear my voice and open the door,
[1:30:56] I will come in to him and I will swap
[1:30:58] him with him and he with me. Praise the
[1:31:02] Lord. Uh to him that overcomemeth will I
[1:31:04] I grant will I grant to sit with me in
[1:31:07] my throne, even with my father in his
[1:31:10] throne. Praise the Lord. He that has an
[1:31:13] ear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:31:15] unto the churches. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:17] Behold, I stand at the door to knock.
[1:31:22] Now, at one point, we lived a life which
[1:31:26] was having no hope. We lived a life
[1:31:29] whereby we saw that it was all enough.
[1:31:32] Praise the Lord. We lived a life where
[1:31:34] we knew that I don't think I can come
[1:31:37] out of this situation. But at a certain
[1:31:40] point, God sent a man. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; God sent a person. Praise the Lord. And
[1:31:46] that person God sent had faced maybe
[1:31:48] many troubles in life. Maybe a person
[1:31:51] riding a bicycle for long distances.
[1:31:54] Maybe a person spending fuel, a person
[1:31:56] spending time in prayer and fasting that
[1:31:59] God today when I go for evangelism.
[1:32:01] Perhaps I may win a soul to the to thy
[1:32:04] kingdom. Now a person has labored to try
[1:32:07] to do his best to reach you and for me.
[1:32:10] Praise the Lord. Now through that
[1:32:12] person, God came knocking your door.
[1:32:14] Praise the Lord. that you may open him
[1:32:16] to come in. And by knocking that door,
[1:32:19] you manage to believe. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:22] By the grace of God, you receive the
[1:32:23] true baptism. Praise the Lord. By the
[1:32:25] grace of God, you receive the Holy
[1:32:27] Spirit. By the grace of God, you are
[1:32:29] still living here today. Praise the
[1:32:31] Lord. Now, the Bible has told us that
[1:32:34] Jesus came knocking at your door. He
[1:32:36] needed accessibility to your place.
[1:32:38] Praise the Lord. He needed accessibility
[1:32:40] to your heart. He needed accessibility
[1:32:42] in your life. Praise the Lord. Then
[1:32:44] whatsoever you do, you needed to access
[1:32:46] it. Praise the Lord. Whatsoever which
[1:32:48] was binding you, you needed to go
[1:32:50] through in order to break it out. It
[1:32:53] took somebody somewhere somehow. Praise
[1:32:55] the Lord. Like the man who was epilepsy.
[1:32:58] It took some people to carry him maybe
[1:33:01] for a distance. It perhaps he was very
[1:33:03] heavy because he was just down. He was
[1:33:05] sick. Praise the Lord. But somebody was
[1:33:07] bearing him, carrying him while having
[1:33:10] hope and faith that this man will get
[1:33:12] healed. Praise the Lord. That is the
[1:33:14] same which has happened today. Brother,
[1:33:16] sister, somebody preach a gospel to you.
[1:33:19] Somebody came with the gospel preaching
[1:33:21] and telling you about the true word of
[1:33:23] God. Somebody came telling you this is
[1:33:26] what it takes for you to be a Christian.
[1:33:28] Somebody came and told you that you're
[1:33:30] lost. You're in a dying world. Praise
[1:33:32] the Lord. Come out of it. Praise the
[1:33:34] Lord. Somebody had to come sweating and
[1:33:37] taking nights praying for you and for
[1:33:39] me. Now that the Lord has knocked your
[1:33:41] door and you've opened, are you ready to
[1:33:43] knock at his door? Praise the Lord.
[1:33:45] Because the Bible says that knock and it
[1:33:47] shall be open. And seek and you shall
[1:33:49] find it. All those kind of things they
[1:33:52] are all abundantly before us. It only
[1:33:54] takes us to present ourselves before the
[1:33:57] Lord and the Lord will give it to us.
[1:33:59] Praise the Lord. Because we have the
[1:34:01] accessibility to everything that we
[1:34:02] desire. Let us not allow the devil again
[1:34:05] to access us through many things. Praise
[1:34:07] the Lord. You know the spirit of can
[1:34:10] influence you to go back to the certain
[1:34:12] old way of your life to start doing the
[1:34:15] same things that you used to do to
[1:34:16] remind you how good all of things were
[1:34:18] praise the lord you have heard a
[1:34:20] testimony the story which a prophet
[1:34:22] spoke about a certain girl I don't
[1:34:24] remember story very well but a girl who
[1:34:26] had been in a disco for a number of
[1:34:28] years but at a certain time when she WAS
[1:34:30] DELIVERED SHE WAS PASSING BY had the
[1:34:32] same music a certain group of people she
[1:34:34] was associate with and she decided to to
[1:34:37] move together with them again. She moved
[1:34:39] by and by. Let me just stand at the
[1:34:41] outside door. Let me just move inside a
[1:34:44] little. Let me NOT DANCE. LET ME JUST
[1:34:46] keep them watch. Let me just keep
[1:34:48] watching on them dancing. Praise the
[1:34:50] Lord. Before she knew, she was also
[1:34:52] doing it. Praise the Lord. That is the
[1:34:53] kind of habit that we need to kill in
[1:34:55] our lives. Because once we allow the
[1:34:57] spirit of the devil to access our lives,
[1:34:59] it is so difficult again for us to come
[1:35:01] out. Praise the Lord. It it takes the
[1:35:03] grace of God because the Bible clearly
[1:35:04] says that if one demon is chest away out
[1:35:07] of a person. They go out there in the
[1:35:09] desert loitering looking for so
[1:35:12] somewhere that they can enter while
[1:35:13] checking at their place. THE BIBLE SAID
[1:35:15] THEY go to the desert there. They just
[1:35:17] loitering. They don't have anywhere to
[1:35:19] occupy any place to occupy. Praise the
[1:35:21] Lord. They desire to come to the same
[1:35:23] person because they enjoyed being you in
[1:35:25] you during their time with you. Praise
[1:35:27] the Lord. They were enjoying because for
[1:35:29] you able to move at night, for you were
[1:35:31] able to steal, you able to speak lies,
[1:35:33] you able to do this and that. Praise the
[1:35:35] Lord. Those demons enjoyed being with
[1:35:37] you in you. Now that they have cast them
[1:35:40] out, they are desiring to come back to
[1:35:42] you again.
[1:35:44] And when they desire to come back to you
[1:35:45] again, that demons do not have anything.
[1:35:48] Praise the Lord. Demons simply use
[1:35:51] things that we God had already created.
[1:35:53] Because during the time during the time
[1:35:56] when the devil was cast down when
[1:35:57] Lucifer was cast down he was cast down
[1:36:00] without anything. Praise the Lord. The
[1:36:02] devil just had to come down to deise a
[1:36:04] mechanism on how best he could deceive a
[1:36:06] person. The devil couldn't GO BEFORE A
[1:36:08] PERSON DIRECTLY. He had to find a beast
[1:36:11] in the land. Praise the Lord. In the
[1:36:13] garden of EDEN THAT HE MAY enter through
[1:36:15] and go and deceive man. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:18] That is how the devil was trying. The
[1:36:20] devil always desires to use somebody
[1:36:22] somewhere. Praise the Lord. Use a
[1:36:24] certain thing in order to lure you into
[1:36:26] sin. Praise the Lord. Now the devil
[1:36:28] knows the things that you desired that
[1:36:30] you loved when you still in the world.
[1:36:32] Now the devil desires that access again
[1:36:34] to get into you. Praise the Lord. He
[1:36:36] desire that how best can I get back into
[1:36:39] my place. But because the weakest of the
[1:36:42] Christian when he kneels down to pray
[1:36:43] even the devil tremble. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:45] Now the devil understands EVEN THAT. NOW
[1:36:47] DO YOU know what the devil does? He
[1:36:49] makes sure that he gets more seven
[1:36:51] demons which are stronger than itself.
[1:36:53] Praise the Lord. Because he knows that
[1:36:55] even that weakest one who is so weak. It
[1:36:58] is hard for me to go there alone. I have
[1:37:00] to gather them them more of my which are
[1:37:04] greater than me. Praise the Lord. Now if
[1:37:06] you love the disco now the devil will
[1:37:09] come back with immorality. Praise the
[1:37:11] Lord. You love the things of the world
[1:37:13] more than you love it before. Praise the
[1:37:14] Lord. You desire to do them all the
[1:37:17] time. Now the devil because he has had
[1:37:20] an access back to you. But I would love
[1:37:23] that in contrary that let us have a
[1:37:25] desire always in our hearts that let God
[1:37:28] always have access and preminence in our
[1:37:31] lives. Let only God operates in your
[1:37:33] life day and night in and out of your
[1:37:36] house. Praise the Lord. At all time let
[1:37:39] it be God operate in your life. Because
[1:37:41] when you God operates in your life,
[1:37:43] there are always things that will may
[1:37:45] happen that you will always rejoice
[1:37:47] because God is present. Praise the Lord.
[1:37:49] There will be blessings that will come
[1:37:51] along your way. Nothing will hinder your
[1:37:53] blessings. Praise the Lord. Because you
[1:37:55] have accessibility to desire whatever
[1:37:58] you desire and you get from the Lord.
[1:38:00] The Bible say that knock and you maybe
[1:38:02] let us read in the book of Matthew
[1:38:03] chapter 7 verse 7
[1:38:06] 7 Matthew.
[1:38:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:12] Praise God.
[1:38:15] Amen.
[1:38:21] Matthew chapter 7:7.
[1:38:28] We are sharing accessibility or access.
[1:38:30] Praise the Lord. Verse seven says that
[1:38:33] ask and it shall be given to you. Seek
[1:38:36] and you shall find. Knock and it shall
[1:38:38] be open unto thee. Praise the Lord. That
[1:38:41] is a kind of attitude. For everyone that
[1:38:43] seeketh receiveth, and that and he that
[1:38:46] seeketh findeth, and he to him that
[1:38:49] knockketh, it shall be open. Praise the
[1:38:52] Lord. Oh, what what man is there of you?
[1:38:56] Whom his son asks for bread, will he
[1:39:01] give a stone? or if he asks a fish and
[1:39:05] will give him a serpent. If he had then
[1:39:08] being evil know how to give good gifts
[1:39:12] unto your children, how much more shall
[1:39:15] your father which is in heaven which is
[1:39:18] in heaven give good things to them that
[1:39:20] ask him. Therefore all things uh
[1:39:24] therefore all things whatsoever yet
[1:39:26] would that man men should do to you do
[1:39:30] do receive do even so to them for this
[1:39:34] is the the law and the the prophets.
[1:39:37] Praise the Lord. This is now the
[1:39:39] accessibility of a Christian. Praise the
[1:39:41] Lord. For we have seen the accessibility
[1:39:44] of the devil. When a devil accesses can
[1:39:47] access a person by all means by any way
[1:39:50] the devil will always torture that
[1:39:52] person scatter him and put him into
[1:39:54] pieces until even you can't recognize a
[1:39:56] person. But now the the grace and the
[1:39:58] mercy of God called you and me out that
[1:40:01] you and me may be may be saved out of
[1:40:04] this world of darkness. Now the Bible
[1:40:06] has given us a freedom access that we
[1:40:09] may go and seek from the father and he
[1:40:11] is ready to give you and for me. Praise
[1:40:13] the Lord. There's always a breakthrough
[1:40:16] where the demons do not have any chance
[1:40:18] to stand before a Christian. Demons do
[1:40:20] not do not have any opportunity to try
[1:40:23] even to come back to you. Praise the
[1:40:25] Lord. Because they know how much they
[1:40:27] are harmed day and night. Whenever you
[1:40:29] pray, whenever you read the word of God,
[1:40:31] whenever you listen to the tapes, praise
[1:40:33] the Lord. Sometimes I desire to listen
[1:40:35] to the tape, even when when I'm
[1:40:36] sleeping. Praise the Lord. I feel that
[1:40:38] atmosphere even when you wake up, you
[1:40:40] feel the preaching is ongoing. Praise
[1:40:42] the Lord. It catches all the demons
[1:40:44] away. I want to tell you whether I as
[1:40:46] much tired as I was, I'll wake up when
[1:40:48] I'm fresh and good. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:50] Because the atmosphere created around me
[1:40:52] had allowed the spirit of God to access
[1:40:54] our house. Praise the Lord. No demon
[1:40:56] could access it by any means. They
[1:40:59] couldn't stand before the presence of
[1:41:00] God. They couldn't share at all. Light
[1:41:03] and darkness cannot share together. One
[1:41:05] are to depart and one to come in. Praise
[1:41:07] the Lord. That is the kind of
[1:41:09] accessibility which every Christian
[1:41:11] ought to have in your life in every
[1:41:13] situation of your life. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:15] Because there's no situation which is
[1:41:17] permanent life. Every situation which
[1:41:19] may come, it will go. It will come and
[1:41:21] will go. Just your mentality, how you
[1:41:24] perceive it at that moment is what
[1:41:26] matters. How do you receive it and how
[1:41:28] do you solve it? Which kind of uh
[1:41:31] situation or how do you relate with the
[1:41:34] with the with the power that you have in
[1:41:35] you? Praise the Lord. When you look at a
[1:41:37] problem and you say that this is too
[1:41:39] hard for me. I don't think I may
[1:41:41] overcome. That one is for so and so. I
[1:41:43] think that one requires me to have a lot
[1:41:45] of money for me to get healed. Praise
[1:41:47] the Lord. It requires me to do this and
[1:41:49] that. Praise the Lord. It doesn't
[1:41:50] require to do anything. It is simply
[1:41:52] requires you to go before God and God
[1:41:54] will do it for you. Because you do not
[1:41:56] have any ability. It is God who has it
[1:41:59] for you. Praise the Lord. He died on the
[1:42:01] cross that he would set you free and
[1:42:03] you're free indeed. And your freedom is
[1:42:05] in Christ. Praise the Lord. Not in the
[1:42:07] things of the world. Do not judge your
[1:42:10] station by the things or the present
[1:42:12] station. Know that you're in Christ and
[1:42:14] Christ are s of it all. He say it is
[1:42:17] finished on the cross and all. It was
[1:42:19] finished. Now that you have
[1:42:20] accessibility to get your healing, to
[1:42:23] get your breakthrough, to get whatsoever
[1:42:25] you desire, brother, sister, why not
[1:42:27] wake up and do it? Praise the Lord. God
[1:42:29] is able to do it for you because he's a
[1:42:31] very present help in times of need.
[1:42:33] Praise the Lord. God is always present
[1:42:35] to deliver you out of every situation.
[1:42:38] No matter how hard it is, no matter how
[1:42:40] difficult it is, you may not be the one
[1:42:42] going through the situation. It may be
[1:42:44] your relative. It may be your friend. It
[1:42:47] may be so and so. But I want to tell you
[1:42:49] because of your faith, your desire for
[1:42:51] somebody to change, God can do it for
[1:42:54] that person. Praise the Lord. That's why
[1:42:56] we labor, we pray, we go to preach the
[1:42:58] gospel, we continue doing it. We don't
[1:43:00] give up. No matter how many will
[1:43:02] discourage you and me. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:05] No matter how many will discourage those
[1:43:06] who you have preached the gospel to,
[1:43:08] your work is rich gospel to them and the
[1:43:10] Lord will do the rest. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:12] God will convert their hearts. God is
[1:43:14] able to change them. God is able to mold
[1:43:17] them to the way that he desires them to
[1:43:19] be. Praise the Lord. HE'S ABLE TO TELL
[1:43:21] THEM TO COME OUT OF every situation that
[1:43:23] they are in. Praise the Lord. Some
[1:43:25] people have allowed access by some
[1:43:27] people get access. I mean some demons
[1:43:30] get access to people in many ways.
[1:43:33] Praise the Lord. Some could be out of
[1:43:35] maybe your family tree. They are just
[1:43:38] following the the kind of covenants that
[1:43:41] you maybe your elderly people made. Now
[1:43:43] they're trying to follow you up. They
[1:43:45] are trying to to tie you. You're not
[1:43:47] prospering spiritually, physically, and
[1:43:50] even with things that of life. You're
[1:43:52] not getting it all together. Praise the
[1:43:54] Lord. And they try to torment you. You
[1:43:56] try to think of a solution. Brother,
[1:43:58] there's no solution out of Christ.
[1:44:00] Praise the Lord. As long as you come to
[1:44:02] Christ, there's always a solution. Some
[1:44:05] demons can access you through the things
[1:44:07] that you love. Praise the Lord. The very
[1:44:09] things that you desire, maybe the phone,
[1:44:11] maybe you desire watching, maybe you
[1:44:13] desire doing this and that. Maybe you
[1:44:15] desire just moving around things, doing
[1:44:18] things which are not necessary all
[1:44:20] together. Praise the Lord. And there the
[1:44:22] demon can access you through that
[1:44:23] because you are so idol you do not have
[1:44:26] any idea of what you can do. Praise the
[1:44:27] Lord. The demons can come into your life
[1:44:30] and they will come and torture your
[1:44:31] life. Praise the Lord. But now that we
[1:44:33] are in Christ, brother, sister, let us
[1:44:35] rise up and that we know that God is
[1:44:38] here with us and to do something good
[1:44:40] for for me and for you. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:42] For God is calling for you and me into
[1:44:45] action. Praise the Lord. An action
[1:44:47] whereby you desire to be changed. You
[1:44:49] desire to be like him. You desire to be
[1:44:52] transformed. You desire to go to heaven.
[1:44:54] You desire to be not in by not to look
[1:44:58] like anyone in this world. Praise the
[1:45:00] Lord. But just to be like Jesus Christ
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; because he's the one who has all in all
[1:45:06] that you desire. Praise the Lord. For
[1:45:08] God is able to deliver you, God is able
[1:45:10] to bring you out. For in this world that
[1:45:12] we are living in full of troubles, full
[1:45:15] of problems that can come into our lives
[1:45:18] at any time not invited by you or not
[1:45:21] desired by you. Praise the Lord that you
[1:45:24] just wake up, a problem has happened,
[1:45:26] tomorrow again you wake up, another one
[1:45:28] comes to pass. Praise the Lord. How do
[1:45:30] we overcome them? Praise the Lord. We
[1:45:32] need to believe that there's a reality
[1:45:33] that Jesus is coming back and there's a
[1:45:36] sudden coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:37] which will come for you and for me. And
[1:45:40] there must be a desire in you to receive
[1:45:42] him because he's coming for a bride.
[1:45:44] Praise the Lord. He's coming for a
[1:45:46] person who is prepared. He's coming for
[1:45:49] a person who is active in the way of the
[1:45:52] cross. Praise the Lord who is carrying
[1:45:53] his cross while following the Lord Jesus
[1:45:55] Christ. Let him access your life and let
[1:45:58] him use you. Let him come into you and
[1:46:01] mold you the way that he desires you to
[1:46:03] be. Praise the Lord. Let him be your
[1:46:05] Lord and God everywhere you go. Be it at
[1:46:08] school, be it at home, be it with
[1:46:10] friends of the world as you're moving
[1:46:12] with them, be it with the Christians,
[1:46:14] whatever it may be, let it be God
[1:46:16] himself leading you at all time. Because
[1:46:19] when God has accessibility in your life,
[1:46:21] he's able to speak to you smoothly.
[1:46:23] Praise the Lord. He's able to dine with
[1:46:25] you just like it was Adam and Eve when
[1:46:28] the princess of God was coming. Praise
[1:46:29] the Lord. All of them could feel the
[1:46:31] sweetness of the presence of God. But
[1:46:33] now because of sin, sin had hindered
[1:46:36] them. Praise the Lord. To feel that
[1:46:37] princess. God had kept his promise. He
[1:46:40] was always coming at a certain time of
[1:46:42] the day. He was coming to speak to them.
[1:46:45] But because of sin, now in them they
[1:46:47] were trembling. They wondering what can
[1:46:49] we do now? How best can we let's run and
[1:46:52] hide? Praise the Lord. God was there
[1:46:54] still present to call unto them. God was
[1:46:57] still calling to them that he may make
[1:46:59] them right again. Praise the Lord. But
[1:47:02] because man has a habit, a desire not to
[1:47:05] expose his sin. Praise the Lord. He
[1:47:08] tries to hinder it by all means. Even
[1:47:10] when a preacher preaches, he doesn't
[1:47:12] care. I think it is for so and so. You
[1:47:14] see him refer in your mind. You refer to
[1:47:16] somebody maybe next to you. You refer to
[1:47:18] somebody maybe in your village. You
[1:47:20] refer to your brother maybe in another
[1:47:22] church. Praise the Lord. It is for so
[1:47:23] and so. It's a mentality built in you
[1:47:26] which you must break. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:28] Adam had to refer to Eve. Eve had to
[1:47:30] refer to the serpent. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:32] They kept on trying to manipulate things
[1:47:34] out to see how to get an excuse. Praise
[1:47:36] the Lord. Let God always come before you
[1:47:39] and find that you're ready to receive
[1:47:41] him. Let the atmosphere of God be before
[1:47:45] you at all time. Let it him come and
[1:47:47] dwell in your heart. Let him stay in you
[1:47:50] at any time that he desires. Praise the
[1:47:52] Lord. When he comes in the night, he
[1:47:54] desires to speak to you in a dream. Let
[1:47:56] him not find demons trying to struggle
[1:47:58] into your house. They feel like to enter
[1:48:00] into your house to come and torment you.
[1:48:01] Praise the Lord. But let there be an
[1:48:03] atmosphere created that he may speak to
[1:48:06] you smoothly. Praise the Lord. that may
[1:48:08] God have access to your life at all
[1:48:11] time. Because if God can access you when
[1:48:14] you wake up in the morning, if God can
[1:48:16] access you even when you're walking in
[1:48:17] the road, when when if God can access
[1:48:19] you even when you're at the workplace or
[1:48:22] you are at school, if God can access you
[1:48:24] even when you're on the bus or you're
[1:48:27] driving, if God can access you in all
[1:48:29] the situations, praise the Lord. My
[1:48:30] brother, my sister, we shall always
[1:48:32] rejoice because God will always do
[1:48:35] miraculous and wonderful things to our
[1:48:37] lives. If accident is on the way, God is
[1:48:39] there to access you. PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:48:41] THERE'S NO SIN WHICH IS HINDERING HIM
[1:48:43] from reaching you. Everything's perfect
[1:48:45] on time. Praise the Lord. And God will
[1:48:47] save you out of every situation because
[1:48:50] your accessibility is open. Your door is
[1:48:52] ready to receive him at any time. IF
[1:48:54] THERE'S A blessing that God is giving
[1:48:56] around the world to his brethren, to his
[1:48:58] children, God should count you also to
[1:49:00] be among those ones.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; If a job, God should say that I have a
[1:49:04] job for so and so in DVF also. Praise
[1:49:06] the Lord. If this marriage I have
[1:49:08] marriage for so and so in DV year.
[1:49:10] Praise the Lord. He should find you
[1:49:12] available to receive it. Praise the
[1:49:14] Lord. LET HIM NOT FIND YOU TRYING TO
[1:49:16] FIND your own solutions. Trying to
[1:49:18] manipulate how to do it in the best way
[1:49:21] that you think. Saul saw that by
[1:49:23] bringing those fatty bulls and those
[1:49:26] nice things before God is so that it
[1:49:28] could please God. He decided to deceive
[1:49:31] the prophet of God. It is how you tell
[1:49:33] that these ones I brought them purposely
[1:49:35] for for sacrifice. You know we have to
[1:49:37] sacrifice to our God. We have to do
[1:49:39] this. Praise the Lord. Here the
[1:49:41] instructions were go and destroy
[1:49:43] everything of Amalachites. Praise the
[1:49:44] Lord. It was supposed to be destroying
[1:49:47] everything. Never to spare anything
[1:49:49] because by sparing such things, such
[1:49:51] things could give accessibility of a
[1:49:53] devil to come and attack the nation.
[1:49:55] Praise the Lord. It happened during the
[1:49:57] time of Joshua when Akan had stolen
[1:49:59] those precious things. Praise the Lord.
[1:50:02] 36 I built about 36 soldiers died. It
[1:50:05] was an accessibility that was given to
[1:50:07] the devil to do his own things that he
[1:50:09] desired. PRAISE THE LORD. BECAUSE GOD'S
[1:50:11] PROMISE was that Joshua was going
[1:50:13] through every war. There will be nobody
[1:50:15] who would die. PRAISE THE LORD. BUT
[1:50:17] BECAUSE OF SIN THAT HAD come amidst,
[1:50:20] something had to happen. Praise the
[1:50:21] Lord. The soldiers died. Now Joshua goes
[1:50:24] back to God and tells God, please God,
[1:50:27] uh, you promised this and that. Praise
[1:50:29] the Lord. God say, "It is true. I
[1:50:30] promised, but it is you, your part which
[1:50:33] was not played well. Praise the Lord.
[1:50:35] And God because he's merciful, still he
[1:50:37] gives you instructions on what to do. He
[1:50:39] tells you do this and that for you to
[1:50:41] repent. Praise the Lord. Now therefore,
[1:50:43] you ought to repent of every sin that
[1:50:45] you have committed before God. Praise
[1:50:47] the Lord. Now, after Akan uh was
[1:50:50] identified with his family and
[1:50:51] destroyed. Uh Joshua went back to the
[1:50:53] battle and he was successful. Praise the
[1:50:56] Lord. God even gave him a strategy on
[1:50:58] how to overcome. You know, there are
[1:50:59] spirits that we are fighting against in
[1:51:01] this life. Praise the Lord. Sometimes we
[1:51:03] don't have ideas on how to overcome.
[1:51:05] Sometimes you feel like maybe I talk to
[1:51:07] pastor, maybe you would help me. Maybe I
[1:51:09] talk to brother so and so, maybe you
[1:51:11] will help me. But still that one also
[1:51:13] you're still debating, maybe it won't
[1:51:15] help me. Maybe let me go to church.
[1:51:19] Maybe I hear that pastor is preaching
[1:51:21] breakthrough. Let me go there. But that
[1:51:23] one also won't help you. You try all
[1:51:25] whatever you try, my brother. It takes
[1:51:27] you to present before God. When God
[1:51:29] presents you a solution, it's a solution
[1:51:32] which works. It doesn't miss. Praise the
[1:51:34] Lord.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; It does not miss at all. God's solution
[1:51:38] will always work because Joshua after
[1:51:41] they have killed, they had killed 36
[1:51:43] soldiers. God gave him instructions.
[1:51:46] Tell that some soldiers pass through let
[1:51:48] them go straight to the camp of your
[1:51:50] enemies. Let others go to the other side
[1:51:52] that you may lure them. These ones who
[1:51:56] go from the front where we leave them to
[1:51:58] run like they are they they are they
[1:52:00] they are being defeated then the other
[1:52:03] ones who have gone over the other side
[1:52:04] will come and destroy everything. Praise
[1:52:06] the Lord. It was not Joshua who devised
[1:52:08] the mechanism. Praise the Lord. It was
[1:52:10] not Joshua who sought it on his own. He
[1:52:13] waited on the Lord and God spoke to him.
[1:52:15] So if you wait on God, God will have a
[1:52:18] solution for you. As long as you allow
[1:52:20] him to do it, he will always do it. IF
[1:52:23] JOSHUA HAD come to to do it on his own,
[1:52:25] I wanted more people would have died.
[1:52:27] But because he need Joshua was so keen,
[1:52:30] he had to go back to the author of life.
[1:52:32] Praise the Lord. The author who gave him
[1:52:34] ability to fight every battle. He went
[1:52:37] back to him. He went and cried before
[1:52:39] the Lord and God answered his prayer.
[1:52:41] Praise the Lord. So God is able to
[1:52:44] access your life and is able to turn
[1:52:46] every situation upside down. Praise the
[1:52:48] Lord.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever it may be, there's no
[1:52:50] limitation. Praise the Lord. But as long
[1:52:52] as you're able to allow him coming into
[1:52:54] you, there's no nothing which cannot
[1:52:57] change. My brother, my sister,
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; this world seems like it is tormenting
[1:53:02] us. But as long as we have Christ in us,
[1:53:06] something must happen in order for you
[1:53:08] to have something. Praise the Lord.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; There must be something that you should
[1:53:13] do. And that something is not on your
[1:53:15] own ability. It's by you letting it all
[1:53:18] to God. Just accepting that God, you can
[1:53:20] do it. And when you let it to God, God
[1:53:23] will surely do it for you. Praise the
[1:53:24] Lord. God will fight every battle that
[1:53:27] you have. God will make you have a
[1:53:29] breakthrough. God will tell you you can
[1:53:31] carry your bed and go back home if you
[1:53:33] are sick. Praise the Lord. God will tell
[1:53:34] you that whatever you desire, you have
[1:53:36] it here with me. I have here with me. I
[1:53:39] have let me present it to you and you
[1:53:41] take it with you. Praise the Lord. That
[1:53:44] is a kind of a mentality a Christian
[1:53:46] should have because demons do not own
[1:53:49] anything. Demons are always broke.
[1:53:51] Demons can just borrow things to use.
[1:53:54] They just borrow a body of a prostitute
[1:53:57] and he present before you a Christian
[1:53:58] brother. Praise the Lord. Delure you
[1:54:00] into sin. The devil does not come to you
[1:54:03] direct as a devil. Praise the Lord. He
[1:54:05] desires to go into a body of somebody
[1:54:07] that he may come deliver you into sin.
[1:54:10] He borrows even money and he deceives
[1:54:13] you THAT GO AND STEAL that money. I want
[1:54:15] to tell you something. You see the money
[1:54:17] which is stolen when you go and buy
[1:54:18] bread that person who who will receive
[1:54:20] that money will not say that this is
[1:54:21] fake money. Praise the Lord. That person
[1:54:24] will receive and use that money even for
[1:54:25] a blessing. But I want to tell you that
[1:54:27] the power which is embedded into that
[1:54:29] money that you have stolen. It is what
[1:54:31] the devil is after. Praise the Lord. The
[1:54:33] devil is using it as a means to access
[1:54:36] your life. Therefore, there's need for
[1:54:38] us to quit all these things and come
[1:54:41] into the Lord Jesus Christ. Let him be
[1:54:43] the one to reign over us at all time at
[1:54:45] all moment because he desires us to be
[1:54:48] changed. As we stand up now and you get
[1:54:50] into prayer, God desires a
[1:54:53] transformation. God desires a person who
[1:54:56] is ready to receive him at all time. We
[1:54:58] may stand up. God desires to be alone in
[1:55:01] your life. God desires not anyone to
[1:55:04] come to access you at at any point.
[1:55:06] Praise the Lord. Because he wants to be
[1:55:09] alone and alone in you. He desires that
[1:55:12] he should be alone at all time. He
[1:55:14] desires that even up to the time of
[1:55:16] rapture, he wants to be alone in you.
[1:55:19] Let not anything of the world lure you
[1:55:21] into sin or take you into captivity of
[1:55:24] the things of the devil. Praise the
[1:55:26] Lord. God is calling you softly and
[1:55:29] tenderly. Jesus is calling as we sing
[1:55:31] that song. Softly and tender.
[1:55:36] Jesus is calling.
[1:55:39] calling for you and for me. Hallelujah.

[2:08:04] Lent in the graveyard
[2:08:24] space
[2:08:30] I saw
[2:08:33] in the grave.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus, we want to say thank
[2:08:41] you for this wonderful time. Let
[2:08:42] everyone speak to the Lord. We come
[2:08:45] before thee Lord Jesus knowing that Lord
[2:08:47] you are the one who delivers us out of
[2:08:50] every struggle, every situation that the
[2:08:52] enemy certain may be fall against our
[2:08:54] lives. We desire to be changed Lord
[2:08:57] Jesus. We desire to be transformed. We
[2:09:00] desire to be like you. We desire to go
[2:09:03] to heaven, Lord Jesus. But how how can
[2:09:06] we do that, Lord Jesus, except we allow
[2:09:09] an excess of thee to come into our
[2:09:11] hearts, Lord. That's why we have come
[2:09:13] this evening, Lord Jesus Christ. Knowing
[2:09:15] that, Father, whatsoever we desire is in
[2:09:17] you. Whatsoever we want is in you, Lord
[2:09:20] Jesus. Come down there for Lord and make
[2:09:23] a way for us. Let us have a way of
[2:09:25] escape. Oh, Lord Jesus Christ. Give us
[2:09:27] wisdom on out overcome.
