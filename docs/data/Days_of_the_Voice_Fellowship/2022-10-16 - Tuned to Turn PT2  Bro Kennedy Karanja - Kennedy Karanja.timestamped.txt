[24:48] date with the with I know I've taken a
[24:51] while so I need to put you to up to date
[24:53] with our contributions towards our
[24:56] church lunch because
[25:01] [Music]
[25:05] before I do that I'd like to remind uh
[25:09] some people who give Pleasures towards
[25:14] the patches of the piano and also the
[25:17] uh the rent but we are moving into this
[25:21] place yeah
[25:24] um
[25:29] uh you have quite a few here I know I'm
[25:33] seeing that you've there are some who
[25:35] have been consistently contributing
[25:40] but if you know that you pledge I would
[25:44] like to encourage you to please fulfill
[25:46] your place
[25:49] you know whenever you whenever you play
[25:53] unto the Lord
[25:55] the Bible says if you do not fulfill
[25:58] Bible
[26:00] you are a fool
[26:02] that's not my word
[26:04] this is God it's the Bible
[26:07] that if we don't fulfill
[26:10] why does the bible call us full
[26:12] righteous like as if you don't believe
[26:14] that God is there
[26:17] because the Bible says only a fool says
[26:20] that there is
[26:23] so if you pledge fulfill your place
[26:28] because God takes that it's not a
[26:30] pleasure to me or to the church it's a
[26:32] place that you've made for the work unto
[26:35] the Lord
[26:40] and so whenever you make a pledge kindly

[27:47] assistant Antonio we are looking for at
[27:49] least 150 Millions

[27:56] do it is
[28:00] act like it
[28:02] foreign

[29:16] just I'll just going back into the
[29:18] archives from 2014.
[29:26] in in November on Wednesday
[29:32] and I had visited I just visited Nairobi
[29:36] Nairobi as a preacher
[29:40] and uh
[29:42] I must meet very many Brethren my name
[29:46] is
[29:48] when you travel you get to meet many
[29:50] people how many more times
[29:56] but as I was walking out of the church
[29:59] after the service
[30:02] then I met this young brother Nancy
[30:08] who was seriously
[30:11] you know looking on his face
[30:16] and you know he stopped me
[30:19] and said God bless you brothers
[30:27] and uh I was young but he was much
[30:30] younger than me
[30:33] I was one year married at that time
[30:39] and uh
[30:41] so the brother told me I said I would
[30:43] like you to pray for me
[30:47] because I have a desire in my heart
[30:58] and so I I I I don't remember whether we
[31:01] prayed there but I remember I prayed
[31:03] with him
[31:06] and we kept you know I gave you my
[31:08] address
[31:09] I was reading this email it says
[31:13] God bless you how are you Brothers Kenny

[31:29] service was over and you told me to get
[31:31] in touch with you
[31:34] I had also told you about the button I
[31:37] have in my heart to serve God
[31:46] and so from that time we continually go

[31:53] and brother Ken has been to Uganda a few
[31:56] times
[31:59] he has preached some phenomenon meetings
[32:05] he got married yeah what's up and
[32:09] there's a family man now massage
[32:11] and uh one thing that I I love about him
[32:18] is that something that I see in myself
[32:21] or I saw it myself even at that time
[32:23] that I saw in him 2018
[32:27] the burden and the Brazil
[32:30] to serve god um
[32:33] you see there are many many people
[32:37] especially young people whatever
[32:40] the devil listen and the devil would
[32:43] like to take especially at a younger age
[32:47] and use them as His ambassadors
[32:53] for checking bank
[33:02] foreign
[33:47] [Music]
[34:35] and uh
[34:37] and with a trip of weeks
[34:42] in that trip
[34:44] God did marvelous things
[34:52] in the city of awasa
[34:54] which is still running even now
[34:59] foreign
[35:31] and you know when you have a different
[35:33] positive for coffee they don't you don't
[35:35] go on any flights
[35:43] and we are grounded
[35:46] and we are isolated
[35:48] so we were all discouraged
[35:52] and both of us were encouraging one
[35:54] another
[36:00] that was quite a moment
[36:03] but the Lord took us through it
[36:07] some good moments
[36:11] but most important
[36:14] is here to preach to us
[36:19] he has preached to us on Wednesday
[36:23] to turn
[36:55] assemblies pasted by Pastor weekly
[36:57] foreign
[37:15] [Music]
[37:25] foreign
[37:43] [Music]
[37:50] [Music]
[37:55] [Music]

[38:02] well he's keeping me alive
[38:05] he's all over me but man is keeping me
[38:10] alive oh Jesus is keeping me alive
[38:16] where is the Holy Ghost on Fire

[39:39] morning
[39:40] is he keeping you alive
[39:50] doing the work of redemption
[39:54] so we have every reason to thank him
[39:56] tonight
[39:58] we have every reason to praise him this
[40:00] is
[40:07] you know there's a reason why
[40:09] let me say that let everything that has
[40:12] breath
[40:14] praise the Lord is the one that gives
[40:18] the breath
[40:19] someone said some time
[40:22] go to the mortuary
[40:25] and put an alarm clock
[40:28] next to the dead body
[40:37] so if he's keeping you alive
[40:40] you have a reason to pray foreign
[40:54] [Applause]
[41:25] foreign
[41:44] [Applause]
[42:49] foreign
[43:49] foreign
[44:49] foreign
[46:08] we want to ensure that we give that uh
[46:11] the full attention that it requires
[46:17] chapter 23.
[46:25] foreign
[47:03] [Music]
[47:19] I sent an angel before thee to keep me
[47:23] in the way and to bring thee into the
[47:26] place which I have prepared
[47:40] the work of keeping the people in the
[47:43] way
[47:45] it was not the work of Moses
[47:48] the work of the Angels
[47:51] the work of bringing the people to the
[47:54] place
[48:01] because it is
[48:11] that our God is a jealous
[48:14] he could not leave the work of Salvation
[48:17] to any man
[48:18] foreign
[49:18] foreign
[49:44] beware of him and obey his voice
[49:52] obey his voice
[50:08] [Music]
[50:55] foreign foreign
[52:55] you're never Mina
[53:18] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:21] we've been speaking about two times
[53:26] and I'm praying that the Lord tonight
[53:28] this this morning
[53:30] I'll just give us a climber for this at
[53:33] 24 years you know we can never really
[53:36] put a full stop to the word of God
[53:39] but I believe other ministers will come
[53:41] in and maybe take the same same line or
[53:43] take another Direction
[53:48] but since the messages
[53:52] the gospel is one engineering the thing
[53:55] is
[53:56] I will not preach like your pastor
[53:59] I may not preach like the ministers that
[54:02] you have here
[54:03] but I believe in the five-fold ministers
[54:12] every finger has a purpose
[54:44] [Music]
[55:07] we shall see how all these things match
[55:10] together
[55:11] but tonight I want to show you this day
[55:14] I want to show you something
[55:15] that we are moving
[56:15] that I'm preaching to members of a
[56:18] church foreign
[57:18] knew him to be a prophet
[57:21] was because it lined up with the
[57:23] scripture
[57:25] each and everything has to line up with
[57:27] the scriptures
[58:17] don't forget
[58:50] we will read the full benefits
[58:56] we would live at a privilege
[59:00] we won't just be listening to our gospel
[59:03] that no come to the house you will be
[59:06] blessed come to the house
[59:10] because you came to the house of the
[59:13] Lord
[59:18] now we finished
[59:21] and we are speaking about this man Moses
[59:32] through Ephesians
[59:41] that is
[59:48] not the end of your Christian Life
[59:56] relation chapter
[59:57] 4.
[1:00:00] it was in the spirit and he could hear
[1:00:04] the voice of the lord
[1:00:10] we can listen to the message
[1:00:21] [Applause]
[1:00:44] foreign
[1:01:36] [Applause]
[1:01:56] I've received the hidden light no from
[1:01:58] now
[1:02:00] I no longer
[1:02:03] that guy sleeps
[1:02:09] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:14] is not coming with this message
[1:02:19] Ephesians chapter four
[1:02:22] depending on his message
[1:02:24] their voice is
[1:02:31] America
[1:02:42] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:44] because when Moses left the scene
[1:02:55] blessed with the name of the Lord
[1:03:00] it was not the work of Moses that is
[1:03:03] your sense that God may help us
[1:03:07] because it comes to a place where
[1:03:09] foreign
[1:03:55] Muhammad
[1:04:06] because the promise of the day
[1:04:09] they were to go back
[1:04:18] that is why we have to measure each and
[1:04:21] everything with the words
[1:04:38] how how you know some things that are
[1:04:41] preached me so much
[1:04:49] as long as it does not match up with the
[1:04:51] words
[1:05:10] and the Lord was always with them
[1:05:14] remember we also said
[1:05:17] our hearts were so hard
[1:05:23] by the grace of the Lord was sufficient
[1:05:27] we know too many that the Old Testament
[1:05:31] was low
[1:05:34] but right there
[1:05:36] these people who are somehow
[1:05:39] experiencing the grace of God yet
[1:05:44] why were they experiencing the grace
[1:05:47] because God had chosen them
[1:05:51] as long as they were with Moses
[1:05:57] of course God will punish them
[1:06:00] right now if you go about in your
[1:06:03] wayward ways
[1:06:05] and you know the truth
[1:06:14] that is the same same thing that
[1:06:15] happened with them
[1:06:33] to fail
[1:06:37] Ure
[1:06:40] not stand to the problems
[1:06:44] comparing the experiences
[1:06:52] forgive me I feel like to mention
[1:06:54] something
[1:06:58] we should Ensure
[1:07:01] that we really check ourselves with the
[1:07:03] word problems
[1:07:06] we cannot say that we are Christians
[1:07:15] we want to pattern ourselves after the
[1:07:18] world
[1:07:20] because God that brought up the children
[1:07:23] of Israel
[1:07:25] and the purpose for them was that they
[1:07:28] should be a
[1:07:29] peculiarism
[1:07:35] God was dealing with these people so
[1:07:37] nicely
[1:07:40] Moses was giving them a challenge
[1:07:43] is there a nation
[1:07:45] that God is so near to them as the way
[1:07:48] is near to you
[1:07:52] this is how God was dealing with the
[1:07:54] children of Israel
[1:08:00] says of God was yes
[1:08:08] the age of the Lord spoke to Moses
[1:08:15] when they go to our place
[1:08:25] I've got instructions to the people
[1:08:31] together
[1:08:37] one shall not live by bread alone
[1:08:56] and Moses gave instructions
[1:09:00] foreign
[1:09:37] foreign
[1:10:22] came to a place
[1:10:26] do not take more okay
[1:10:29] on particular days
[1:10:33] because on the next day
[1:10:41] but I know they did not believe
[1:10:44] some of them
[1:10:46] and for sure
[1:11:00] very simple things
[1:11:02] very simple Charlie
[1:11:05] but yeah it was the voice of the age
[1:11:09] another time he tells them about this
[1:11:13] day for today and for tomorrow
[1:11:20] because tomorrow
[1:11:22] will be nothing that will fall
[1:11:25] now
[1:11:27] for today
[1:11:30] when they go up the next day
[1:11:37] because some of these people thought
[1:11:40] what this man is talking about
[1:11:43] we are so used to Moses
[1:12:23] whatsoever you will come across
[1:12:27] children do not fear because
[1:12:31] [Applause]
[1:13:49] I don't know how it happens
[1:13:54] foreign
[1:14:53] hallelujah amen because the children of
[1:14:57] Israelites
[1:15:07] for sure
[1:15:11] there is no sickness
[1:15:15] there's not me now
[1:15:17] they knew
[1:15:19] sickness and what was under my face
[1:15:27] that is why Moses monster maybe I can
[1:15:30] just repeat those that were not here
[1:15:35] there was a contention
[1:15:38] between Lucifer and Michael
[1:15:41] over the body of Moses
[1:15:48] because kubanga
[1:15:50] Moses never entered the promises
[1:15:54] the only thing that we read is that
[1:15:57] there was a battle instrumental as they
[1:16:01] were fighting over his pockets
[1:16:04] that the reason this was because
[1:16:18] disciples
[1:16:59] [Applause]
[1:17:18] Christopher
[1:17:49] foreign
[1:18:07] he didn't just bite anywhere
[1:18:10] in the promises
[1:18:15] these people had Revelations
[1:18:18] these people had Revelations
[1:18:20] because they knew as long as we're in
[1:18:23] the promised lands
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:31] Hallelujah
[1:18:33] I repeat myself and guess the mechanism
[1:18:36] Upon This Rock through us
[1:18:41] the Chili Peppers
[1:19:19] foreign
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:20:16] [Applause]
[1:20:19] no
[1:20:21] [Applause]
[1:21:09] foreign
[1:21:38] the biggest the biggest broadcasting
[1:21:41] network in UK NBS yes and yes your work
[1:21:44] is not to be NBS
[1:22:18] good job
[1:22:21] hallelujah hallelujah they tried so many
[1:22:24] instances
[1:22:25] they tried so many instances
[1:22:32] because the promise of God was
[1:22:36] in America
[1:22:40] foreign
[1:23:36] look at David foreign
[1:24:15] we are dealing with the heart remember
[1:24:20] when it comes and hears
[1:24:22] the Defiance of this Goliath Korea
[1:24:31] how can these things be here
[1:24:35] are people of the promise
[1:24:49] foreign
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:30] but if your heart has been turned to God
[1:25:33] no matter what comes your way yeah
[1:25:44] because God
[1:25:46] is a god of possibilities
[1:25:51] [Applause]
[1:26:01] Jonah
[1:26:19] um
[1:26:25] David was depending on the problem
[1:26:34] that is my sense the problem is
[1:26:38] not that we do not believe the Bible
[1:26:41] is a Bible we have not just turned back
[1:26:46] we have not received the Holy quotes
[1:26:54] when the spirit of truth shall come from

[1:27:06] when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:27:09] we will teach you how to dress
[1:27:12] he will teach you how to love your wife
[1:27:14] and your husband
[1:27:16] that's right we'll teach you how to save
[1:27:18] me
[1:27:20] he'll teach you how to run the house
[1:27:32] sisters he will teach you to be like a
[1:27:34] modern day Esther a Japanese
[1:27:41] foreign
[1:28:19] not the crown singular
[1:28:23] that is
[1:28:26] a difference
[1:28:28] between someone who is Anointed
[1:28:32] and someone who is
[1:28:37] check this out you will have some
[1:28:40] presidents
[1:28:43] that will come into some authorities
[1:29:04] but with anointing
[1:29:07] it also gives you an assurance
[1:29:10] I may not be crowned yet
[1:29:16] my day of crowning
[1:29:20] so it is not the crown that gives you
[1:29:23] the right and the power to act as a kid
[1:29:30] someone is
[1:29:36] we said black Andy you will have a
[1:29:39] president
[1:29:45] have the crown yes
[1:29:53] but look at David
[1:29:55] had been anointed
[1:30:00] pushes him to act as a killer myself
[1:30:12] amen hallelujah I don't know if someone
[1:30:15] is getting me this is
[1:30:48] I believe in the three episodes
[1:30:53] foreign
[1:32:15] come on
[1:32:18] you have an issue in your life

[1:33:56] anointing yeah
