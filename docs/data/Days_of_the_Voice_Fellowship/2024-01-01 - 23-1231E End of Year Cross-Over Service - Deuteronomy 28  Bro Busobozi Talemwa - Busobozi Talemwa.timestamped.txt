[12:04] subject I don't have a title I don't
[12:06] have notes I have nothing I have the
[12:09] Bible with
[12:10] me and uh God inspired me to read this
[12:14] scripture for you and I trust that it
[12:16] will bless someone here today as we are
[12:19] crossing over into this New Year praise
[12:22] God so we are just maybe the brother on
[12:25] the streaming if you want a title just
[12:27] set theonomy 28
[12:29] Deuteronomy 28 that's what we are
[12:31] dealing with I'll just read a few
[12:33] portions a little portion and then you
[12:35] will just be seated so we can talk about
[12:37] the rest while you are seated and it
[12:39] shall come to pass if Thou shalt hecken
[12:41] diligently unto the voice of the Lord
[12:44] thy God to observe and to do all his
[12:47] Commandments which I command thee this
[12:49] day that the Lord thy God will set thee
[12:53] on high above all nations of the
[12:56] earth
[12:57] amen do we believe that amen you may be
[13:03] seated and we ask God's blessings upon
[13:05] the word this uh this evening so as you
[13:09] noticed uh we have a few moments I'm
[13:11] sorry there are people who uh we
[13:13] supposed to be singing and we have also
[13:15] testimonies but we we are 1 hour late so
[13:19] uh if you must give that before we go if
[13:23] we want testimonies only that are
[13:24] burning testimonies of the things that
[13:26] God has done for you this this old year
[13:28] of 2023 which we are leaving so don't go
[13:31] back with those testimonies things maybe
[13:34] a service which was preached and helped
[13:36] you or something that God did for you
[13:38] through prayer or you know whatever you
[13:41] have that the Lord did for you we want
[13:42] to have those testimonies and so don't
[13:45] go with them
[13:47] together after the preaching we are
[13:49] going to go into
[13:50] prayer uh uh let the the New Year find
[13:54] us in prayer how many have their needs
[13:56] that they have written on their papers
[13:59] okay now a few have written uh needs if
[14:02] you you've not written your needs uh
[14:06] then the Bible says that write the
[14:09] vision it may T but it will surely come
[14:11] to pass so write it down writing it down
[14:15] is is a show and uh a show of Faith so
[14:18] write it down uh when we go in prayer
[14:20] you just commit it before God and keep
[14:22] it somewhere you will realize that at
[14:25] the end of the year uh you can bring it
[14:27] out and you realize that God has
[14:29] answered most of your prayers if not
[14:31] all so now this evening I just want to
[14:34] share um I have a burden on sharing this
[14:38] chapter with you I was reading it for
[14:41] some brethren and I noticed it is a a
[14:45] blessing it is a a very huge chapter but
[14:48] we shall cover as much as we can before
[14:50] we go to prayer this evening now I
[14:53] noticed in the morning I I shared with
[14:55] you on uh on crossing over
[14:59] crossing over into the next phase now I
[15:02] believe that we are at a time when we
[15:05] are crossing over not only the crossover
[15:07] of a year but we are crossing over into
[15:10] another
[15:17] phase you know we are entering into a
[15:20] place where others have never entered
[15:22] before 2024 David never saw
[15:26] 2024 no one has ever seen I mean all
[15:29] those who lived before
[15:32] us think about it those of you who are
[15:35] born in the 80s and the 70s and the 60s
[15:37] imagine did you ever think that you will
[15:39] live to 2024 2024 that's many years a
[15:44] many years ahead you thought but here we
[15:46] are 2024 is here and very soon if the L
[15:50] tell is we are going to be counting
[15:52] 2040 2050 2060 I don't believe we shall
[15:56] get there before the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:57] comes back again
[15:59] but if we get there here is what I want
[16:01] to show you that the Lord has given to
[16:04] me to give to you in this new year how
[16:07] many remember remember what we shared on
[16:10] last year December
[16:15] 31st sister
[16:20] Winnie
[16:22] huh yeah I think that was within the the
[16:25] year or close to the end of year but yes
[16:27] brother you have the
[16:31] subject it's the same thing ah Brethren
[16:36] I think we are forgotten I was just
[16:37] looking here I saw something like um
[16:41] something different I don't know why you
[16:42] are saying that but uh I think it was
[16:45] something
[16:47] different that's why we talked about
[16:49] Arnold Von winked and we were talking
[16:51] about uh we are talking
[16:54] about uh let me find it here just a
[16:57] moment
[17:04] yes yes do the best you can ah God bless
[17:07] you my brother do the best you can
[17:10] that's what we talked about but this
[17:12] year we are not talking about doing the
[17:13] best you can but let me ask how many
[17:16] have done the best they could this past
[17:27] year
[17:31] I believe we have done the best we could
[17:32] to serve God if whenever you came to the
[17:35] service here you have done the best you
[17:37] could whenever you prayed you've done
[17:39] the best you could but now this year
[17:42] we're talking about getting into the
[17:44] next phase now not doing the best you
[17:46] can but getting into the next phase
[17:49] getting into the next phase praise the
[17:50] name of the Lord now the next phase is
[17:53] going to be nothing but a blessing of
[17:56] God all right so the ones who came in
[17:58] the the morning and did not come here in
[18:00] this service they are going to
[18:02] miss so here we are talking about um the
[18:05] next phase which is the blessing of of
[18:08] God the blessing in the land remember
[18:11] these people the Jews the when they were
[18:13] crossing over when they crossed over
[18:15] from from um Egypt and they were
[18:18] crossing over uh the Red Sea going to
[18:21] the promised land H their purpose their
[18:24] purpose was the promised land and they
[18:27] were purpose to cross over into the
[18:29] promised land but there are conditions
[18:33] of blessing in the promised land now
[18:37] today I want to just share with you
[18:39] Deuteronomy 28 talking about the
[18:42] blessings of the promised land so get
[18:47] your Bible get your Bible and brother
[18:49] put those scriptures we are going to
[18:50] read verse by verse I'm just laying it
[18:54] out to you as it is in the Bible and I
[18:56] trust that we will take it serious and
[18:58] it will be a blessing to each of us uh
[19:01] this this evening
[19:03] amen and it shall come to pass if Thou
[19:07] shalt hecken diligently unto the voice
[19:09] of the Lord thy God to observe and to do
[19:12] all his Commandments which I command
[19:14] thee this day 31st December
[19:21] 2023 to observe and to do all his
[19:24] Commandments which I command thee this
[19:26] day that the Lord thy God will set the
[19:28] the on high above all nations of the
[19:31] earth and all these blessings shall come
[19:34] on thee he is saying all the the
[19:37] blessings which is going to tell you all
[19:38] these blessings shall come on thee not
[19:41] only that but they will overtake thee
[19:45] they will come on you and they will
[19:47] overtake you and then he says if Thou
[19:51] shalt hecken unto the voice of the Lord
[19:54] thy God and now he begins the blessings
[19:57] how many to hear the
[19:59] blessings amen now whatever blessing you
[20:02] say Amen to it will be a
[20:05] portion number one he says blessed shalt
[20:09] thou be in the city and blessed shalt
[20:12] thou be in the
[20:14] field
[20:16] Hallelujah blessed shall be the fruit of
[20:19] thy
[20:20] body and the fruit of thy ground and the

[20:30] thy
[20:32] sheep he continues on blessed shall be
[20:36] thy basket and thy
[20:38] store now these blessings are so many
[20:41] and I trust that our amen will grow
[20:43] stronger and stronger and stronger
[20:45] because the more the blessing is coming
[20:47] the more we should grow stronger and
[20:48] better praise the name of the
[20:50] Lord number six blessed shalt thou be
[20:54] when thou comest in and blessed shalt
[20:57] thou be when thou goest
[20:59] out the Lord shall cause thy enemies
[21:02] that rise up against thee to be smen
[21:05] before thy face they shall come out
[21:08] against thee one way and flee before the
[21:11] seven
[21:13] ways the Lord shall command the blessing
[21:16] upon thee in thy stor houses and in all
[21:21] that thou set thy hand oh my God and all
[21:26] set thy hand unto
[21:33] whatever you set
[21:35] yourto I'm telling you this is another
[21:37] phase whatever you were doing if it was
[21:39] not going well now he's saying whatever
[21:41] you will set your hand unto and he shall
[21:44] bless thee in the land which the Lord
[21:47] thy God giveth thee now if you if you
[21:50] are crossing over into the next pH this
[21:52] is the blessings which are a waiting for
[21:54] you there
[21:56] Hallelujah and then he says the Lord
[21:59] shall establish thee and all people unto
[22:02] himself as he has sworn unto thee if
[22:04] thou shal keep the Commandments of the
[22:07] Lord thy God and walk in his ways and

[22:30] fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of
[22:33] thy ground in the land which the Lord

[22:38] Thee the Lord shall open unto thee his
[22:41] good treasure the heaven to give the
[22:43] rain unto thy land in his season and to
[22:46] bless all the work of thine hand and
[22:48] thou shalt land unto many nations and

[23:21] you they're touching me so much amen and
[23:24] the Lord shall make Thee the head and
[23:26] not the tail

[23:30] [Laughter]
[23:33] only Hallelujah and thou shall be above
[23:37] only brother Peter can I hear a big amen
[23:41] there
[23:44] hallelujah oh my God and and thou shalt
[23:47] be above only and thou shalt not be
[23:50] beneath if if that thou hecken unto the
[23:54] Commandments of the Lord thy God which I
[23:56] command thee this day to observe and to
[23:59] do
[24:00] them and thou shalt not go aside from
[24:04] any of The Words which I command the
[24:06] this day to the right hand or to the
[24:08] left to go after other gods to serve
[24:12] them and then it continues on
[24:15] here now but it shall come to
[24:21] pass verse 15 I pray from verse 15 it
[24:26] will not be your portion
[24:30] but nonetheless let me read a few when I
[24:33] I read deom 28 the curses are more than
[24:36] the
[24:39] blessings are you hearing me that's why
[24:42] you see when people don't follow Jesus
[24:43] Christ with all their heart they are
[24:45] they have a lot of problems and they
[24:48] seem that they are worse than the people
[24:50] who are following Jesus
[24:56] Christ
[25:11] that's why you should really serve God
[25:13] with all your
[25:16] heart I want Deuteronomy 28 from verse 1
[25:19] to verse4 to be my portion in Jesus name
[25:22] let it be your portion in Jesus name for
[25:24] year
[25:25] 2024 but just
[25:28] for others who are not expecting to
[25:30] follow Jesus Christ with all their heart
[25:33] you hear from verse 15 and because the
[25:35] cures are so many I will not finish all
[25:37] of them they're just so
[25:38] many verse 15 but it shall come to pass
[25:43] if thou Willl not hecken unto the voice
[25:45] of the Lord thy God to observe to do all
[25:48] his Commandments and his statutes which
[25:50] I command thee this day that all these
[25:52] curses shall come upon thee and overtake
[25:55] thee uhhuh now the one on who are
[25:58] wanting these curses they can say
[26:02] Amen verse 16 Cur shall thou be in the
[26:06] city and cast shall thou be in the field
[26:09] cast shall be thy basket and thy store
[26:12] cast shall be the fruit of thy body and
[26:14] the fruit of thy land the increase of
[26:16] thy kind and the flocks of thy of thy
[26:19] sheep and I pray instead of saying amen
[26:21] you would say God forbid cast shall thou
[26:25] be when thou comest in and cast sh thou
[26:28] be when thou goest out the Lord shall
[26:30] send upon thee cursing vexation and
[26:32] rebuke in all that thou set thy hand
[26:35] unto for to do until thou be destroyed
[26:37] and until thou perish quickly because of
[26:39] the wickedness of thy doings whereby
[26:41] thou Hast forsaken me God forbid God
[26:44] forbid that the Lord shall make the
[26:47] pestilence cleave unto thee until have
[26:50] until he have consumed thee from off the
[26:53] land with thou goest to possess it the
[26:55] Lord shall smite thee with a cons a a
[26:58] consumtion and with a fever and with a
[27:00] un inflammation and with un extreme
[27:02] burning and with a sword and with a
[27:05] blasting and with a mild you and they
[27:07] shall pursue thee until thou perish God
[27:10] forbid and a heaven that is over thy
[27:13] head shall be brass and the earth that
[27:15] is under thee shall be Iron the Lord
[27:18] shall make oh my God you better say God
[27:20] forbid orless this will happen to you

[27:29] destroyed the Lord shall cause thee to
[27:32] be smen before thine enemies thou shall

[31:28] I'm tired of reading
[31:31] curses the curses are
[31:38] continuous God bless you for that God
[31:41] bless you for that friends when you look
[31:45] at Deuteronomy 28 after here I'm
[31:48] requesting you to go and read it take
[31:49] your time and read it uh the Bible says
[31:52] the blessing of God maketh rich and he
[31:56] adds no sorrow meaning he adds no curse
[31:58] on it that's why these people who say
[32:00] that uh you can be in Christ and you are
[32:03] under a curse they are wrong you cannot
[32:07] be under a curse when you are filled
[32:10] with the Holy Spirit and when you
[32:12] following the ways of the
[32:14] word the curse comes only to you when
[32:18] you do not have the blessing of
[32:26] God
[32:34] you know there was a Brothers you know
[32:36] dozing in in the church down in Zimbabwe
[32:39] and and he had removed his shoes in a
[32:41] very comfortable place like that and he
[32:43] had removed his shoes and his shoes were
[32:45] on the side and the pastor was preaching
[32:47] talking about Elisha and um rather
[32:50] talking about Elijah going and Elisha
[32:52] was following on and then he said the
[32:54] Chariot of fire came down and The
[32:56] Chariot of Fire took Elijah and then the
[32:58] man woke up he was hearing the story
[33:00] while he was sleeping so he woke up and
[33:02] stood on his feet he said ah he has gone
[33:05] with my
[33:10] shoes he
[33:14] said so the brother the brother
[33:20] who the brother who was close by he told
[33:23] him brother your shoes are
[33:25] here
[33:27] Elijah did not go with
[33:30] them and the brother was standing
[33:32] looking up he has going with my shoes
[33:35] so even for him to sit down was a
[33:38] problem he never doed in church
[33:43] again you
[33:53] know so don't cross over the and say ah
[33:57] they have left me and they are still
[33:59] here so we are crossing over don't cross
[34:02] over with dozing in the
[34:04] church say
[34:07] amen
[34:08] hallelujah my my my my my you should
[34:12] cross over the Y when you are sober you
[34:14] should go to the next this next phase
[34:16] when you are sober so friends uh for the
[34:19] for a few more minutes maybe five
[34:20] minutes I was telling you that you know
[34:23] when God gives you the blessing that
[34:25] blessing he does not add sorrow on it so
[34:27] it is impossible listen this is a
[34:29] Doctrine it is impossible for someone to
[34:32] be in Christ and still be
[34:34] cast did you know that it is impossible
[34:38] number number two it is impossible for
[34:40] someone to be in Christ and Witchcraft
[34:42] to be upon them are you hearing it is
[34:46] impossible the moment you are in Christ
[34:48] they can be all they want that that
[34:50] witchcraft can not catch you because you
[34:52] are under protection you know the Bible
[34:55] says there is no enchantment upon Israel
[34:57] no witchcraft to Jacob you know it is
[34:59] impossible to bech you it is
[35:20] impossible if you are in Christ or you
[35:24] you confess Christ but you know what was
[35:27] the condition and it shall come to pass
[35:30] if Thou shalt hecken
[35:33] diligently unto the voice of the Lord
[35:42] goder to do all his Commandments which
[35:44] iand this
[35:51] day that the Lord thy God will set thee
[35:55] on high above all all nations of the
[36:02] earth and all these blessings shall come
[36:06] on thee and overtake you meaning the
[36:09] blessings when they come they will even
[36:11] overtake you wherever you go the
[36:14] blessing will have gone there F so it
[36:15] will be following you and and it will be
[36:17] ahead of you and following you praise
[36:20] the name of the
[36:21] Lord but if you don't do that then the
[36:24] Cur will be following how many want the
[36:26] blessing of God in 2024 Hallelujah let
[36:30] me tell you right now as I'm speaking to
[36:31] you there are many people in shrines
[36:34] right now now now now they in shrines
[36:37] getting the anointing of
[36:39] a they in shrines they are cutting them
[36:42] they are putting drugs they are you know
[36:45] you know doing enchantments they are you
[36:47] know blessing them they are you know
[36:49] bringing powder K shells is it called K
[36:52] shells and other things but all those
[36:56] that they are going to get their ACC
[36:58] curses but for you you are here going to
[37:01] get the blessing of God and my prayer
[37:04] for you for 2024 but remember this
[37:07] prayer has a
[37:09] condition
[37:11] so that's where we are different because
[37:14] the Pentecost will tell you take the
[37:15] blessing but you're taking the blessing
[37:17] from
[37:23] nowhere you either trust God or you
[37:25] don't trust him all but if you trust him
[37:28] then the blessing of God must come upon
[37:30] your
[37:32] life and all the blessing we have read
[37:35] today you know from verse one up to
[37:37] verse 14 I want to say let it be your
[37:42] portion let it be your portion in the
[37:44] name of our Lord Jesus Christ and that
[37:46] is my crossover message
[37:48] period

[1:40:13] the message I found a real family I've
[1:40:17] got to know what really love is I've got
[1:40:20] to know what what it means to have a
[1:40:23] family living in unity and real love
[1:40:27] have my spiritual life has really been
[1:40:30] uplifted I've learned how to pray yes I
[1:40:33] used to pray but I've learned how to
[1:40:35] pray effectively I've really known what
[1:40:38] it means to have an encounter with God
[1:40:41] I've learned very many things from the
[1:40:44] message and I really bless the Lord for
[1:40:49] it
[1:40:51] I really thank I thank the Lord that he
[1:40:53] found me
[1:40:55] because I got I received a message from
[1:40:59] school but I even don't know even up to
[1:41:02] now I still ask myself how I joined
[1:41:05] Aviation because it was never my dream I
[1:41:08] had never dreamed of doing aviation in
[1:41:10] my life but when the results came back
[1:41:14] that's my parents saided tell me you go
[1:41:16] for Aviation you're going to be a hot
[1:41:18] cake I'm like no that's not what I want
[1:41:20] to do do but then I also asked God I
[1:41:24] sought for his eyes on what exactly he
[1:41:26] wanted me to do and then I found out
[1:41:29] that he really wanted me to go for
[1:41:31] Aviation and slowly by slowly he put the
[1:41:34] passion in my heart so at the school
[1:41:39] where I am that's where the message met
[1:41:42] me and I really bless the Lord for that
[1:41:45] I bless him that he he for knew me even
[1:41:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:41:51] I also bless the Lord for providing for
[1:41:53] me he has provided for me I bless him
[1:41:56] for the protection I bless him for the
[1:41:58] family of Pastor tala they have really

[1:55:31] you praise God
[1:55:34] Church praise
[1:55:36] God I thank God so much for last year I
[1:55:40] thank God so much for my
[1:55:42] life I I had a problem with my C like
[1:55:49] four years years
[1:55:50] ago and I was supposed to be operated I
[1:55:53] went to the hospital and they told me
[1:55:56] that I'm going to be operated I
[1:55:58] deposited money full money for the
[1:56:00] operation but was during
[1:56:03] covid the issues of transport and how to
[1:56:06] travel and I didn't go to hospital for
[1:56:09] that operation that's how I missed the
[1:56:11] operation and all the payment was paid
[1:56:14] what has been disturbing
[1:56:16] me before going to the hospital for the
[1:56:20] for the
[1:56:21] operation okay before going to the
[1:56:23] hospital the time they told me I'm
[1:56:25] supposed to be operated I kept going to
[1:56:28] hospital earlier on but they keep they
[1:56:31] kept giving me
[1:56:33] medicine when I take that
[1:56:35] medicine the Cod issue stops for just
[1:56:40] very few days and it comes back I go
[1:56:42] back to hospital it stops for a few days
[1:56:45] and it comes back so this time I went to
[1:56:48] a very big hospital and they told me I
[1:56:49] needed to be
[1:56:51] operated I didn't go for that operation
[1:56:54] money went like that the code kept
[1:56:56] disturbing me each time I hear someone
[1:56:59] has died and the issue started small I
[1:57:02] used to get
[1:57:03] scared but I was tired sometime I would
[1:57:07] go to hospital give me little medicine I
[1:57:11] take it it stops for a few days I got
[1:57:13] tired of medicine they told me to clean
[1:57:15] it I got
[1:57:17] tired so I said God I'm leaving this to
[1:57:20] you I can't do anything I've gone to
[1:57:23] hospital everything is still failing so
[1:57:26] I left I didn't do anything I never used
[1:57:29] to even clean it but I thank God I
[1:57:32] didn't do anything but last year God
[1:57:36] healed me my Cod is
[1:57:40] fine no longer feel any
[1:57:43] pain and I'm healthy in Jesus's
[1:57:48] name
[1:57:52] again again last year I faced a lot of
[1:57:55] challenges those challenges put me down
[1:57:58] and that's the time you
[1:58:00] start asking your faith you
[1:58:03] start that's the time I knew that I
[1:58:06] can't be safe because saved because my
[1:58:09] parents are
[1:58:11] believers I had a lot of questions in my
[1:58:13] head I had a lot of
[1:58:17] issues but I thank God that those issues
[1:58:21] have given me a step in the spiritual
[1:58:23] life and I
[1:58:26] believe like right what pastor preached
[1:58:29] in the beginning of last year he said we
[1:58:32] should do our best I as doing my best
[1:58:35] but challenges were
[1:58:37] increasing I think it was a test even
[1:58:40] though they all not done but I believe
[1:58:43] my spiritual life has
[1:58:46] increased and I believe that today the
[1:58:50] far was pushed
[1:58:52] away I'm going to the next
[1:58:57] phase
[1:58:59] amen I also want to bless God with this
[1:59:02] song I Want To Praise

[2:02:26] testimony and a special
[2:02:30] song you know most time if you are told
[2:02:34] that you're going to operated heals
[2:02:47] you
[2:02:54] brother Ian you come and give your
[2:02:57] testimony and then after brother
[2:03:02] Ivan sister EST and brother Peter
[2:03:04] requested to
[2:03:09] sing okay I think this one I don't know
[2:03:12] what it was for okay after brother Ivan
[2:03:15] sister Priscilla and sister Rachel you
[2:03:17] will sing your special
[2:03:22] God bless you
[2:03:24] church I I want to thank
[2:03:28] God I want to thank God for the many
[2:03:31] things he has done for me a few days ago
[2:03:34] I was in prayer and uh I felt a bit bad
[2:03:39] because God has done so much for me that
[2:03:41] I've thanked him
[2:03:43] so and so today I felt like maybe I
[2:03:46] should thank him bit more
[2:03:49] yeah it it all started when I got saved
[2:03:52] around
[2:03:55] 2019 I was in the medical school I never
[2:04:00] like medical so much but I was good at
[2:04:03] it and so when I got the message I
[2:04:07] stopped reading my medical books because
[2:04:09] I could read the message books
[2:04:12] Supernatural books and the Bible only
[2:04:16] and so my friends kept on worrying about
[2:04:18] me
[2:04:19] because they thought I would fail you
[2:04:21] cannot pass medical without reading very
[2:04:25] few people do it and so around two weeks
[2:04:28] to the paper it's when I realized that I
[2:04:33] I had very little knowledge of what you
[2:04:35] are supposed to cover and I was a bit
[2:04:38] worried my friends were a bit worried
[2:04:40] for me but I really thank go because I
[2:04:44] was in prayer and uh around two weeks to
[2:04:47] the paper I had I slept then God gave me
[2:04:51] the grace I was doing a paper and when I
[2:04:55] woke up I wrote all the questions that I
[2:04:58] was answering in the paper and so when I
[2:05:01] went for the paper it was exactly what
[2:05:05] i' had seen two weeks
[2:05:08] ago
[2:05:10] and when when the results came back I
[2:05:14] had a higher GPA than for my friends
[2:05:20] yeah so when the results came back they
[2:05:24] thought maybe I used to read but I used
[2:05:27] to lie them that I don't read but I told
[2:05:30] them I just go to church because I used
[2:05:32] to sleep in church and than good for
[2:05:35] that and when I finished my medical
[2:05:40] course over three years
[2:05:42] ago personally I've never looked for a
[2:05:46] joke and uh person personally my boss
[2:05:50] should not see this
[2:05:52] testimony they have never seen my
[2:05:55] papers even my
[2:05:57] ey7 theyve never seen it all the jobs
[2:06:00] I've worked in within these three years
[2:06:03] they just call me where you did medical
[2:06:07] when do you want to start
[2:06:08] working yeah so I I really thank God so
[2:06:13] much was all of them have never seen my
[2:06:17] papers all they know is I did some
[2:06:20] medical course but I work that's why I
[2:06:23] don't want my boss to see this
[2:06:26] testimony might he might ask me for the
[2:06:29] papers
[2:06:30] now but I believe good is the one who
[2:06:34] has been taking care of
[2:06:36] me and then this year I was in prayer
[2:06:41] and I really wanted something and it was
[2:06:44] costing a
[2:06:45] bit some money then I got something to
[2:06:49] do so I can pay it off but I was
[2:06:54] supposed to come to church again so I
[2:06:56] had to leave it then I came to church
[2:06:59] and then a few weeks after that there's
[2:07:02] a friend of mine who sent me a vure it's
[2:07:05] a supermarket vulture it was worth some
[2:07:09] good money so he told me I'm sending to
[2:07:11] you a vulture you can go to this
[2:07:14] supermarket and you get whatever you
[2:07:16] want for this am of money and so I
[2:07:20] received the vure then I went and I got
[2:07:23] whatever I wanted to
[2:07:25] get and yeah I I I really thank God for
[2:07:30] that and there are very many more things
[2:07:32] God has done for
[2:07:33] me that I would I would wish to share it
[2:07:37] some other time probably God bless
[2:07:40] [Applause]
[2:07:45] you praise the Lord oh what a
[2:07:51] testimony brother Ivan we thank God for
[2:07:54] that
[2:07:55] testimony reminded with one of one

[2:07:59] that when they adverti for a job for him
[2:08:03] he had no papers what he did uh he put
[2:08:06] the Bible in the
[2:08:09] envelope and then he submitted his
[2:08:13] application
[2:08:17] so so
[2:08:19] everybody was interested to see the man
[2:08:21] who put the Bible in the envelope and
[2:08:23] ended up getting the job big job
[2:08:28] like yeah so Jesus Christ the same

[2:14:31] church happy New
[2:14:34] Year uh we are such a close team me and
[2:14:40] Diana
[2:14:42] um I want to celebrate the name of the
[2:14:45] Lord Jesus
[2:14:46] Christ
[2:14:51] when when I came here when I joined this
[2:14:55] church had already began looking for
[2:14:57] church from
[2:15:00] 2017 my getting out of church that is
[2:15:04] now the past but I came back to the
[2:15:09] message what set me running back to the
[2:15:12] message was the issue of
[2:15:14] children I have four children three
[2:15:17] girls
[2:15:18] and one boy I became desperate there
[2:15:22] were this past that going back to the
[2:15:25] world and I
[2:15:27] knew something was striking them to
[2:15:30] remove them from my
[2:15:32] heart when I came here I was desperate I
[2:15:35] was emotional I would
[2:15:38] cry and then what even spiked all
[2:15:43] this when I saw
[2:15:46] f
[2:15:48] but um I am
[2:15:51] grateful Fiona is back on
[2:15:57] track don't look theal side because it's
[2:16:01] going to come
[2:16:03] back if you had seen her three year
[2:16:06] about 2 years and N months
[2:16:11] ago I think she was clinically
[2:16:14] pronounced dead when I in
[2:16:18] she recovered all the systems
[2:16:21] recovered the brain actually had
[2:16:24] died the another system had
[2:16:28] failed she had a stroke and a paralysis
[2:16:31] and a blood clot instantly at a go so
[2:16:36] when you see her stand here she's a
[2:16:37] living
[2:16:40] [Applause]
[2:16:43] testimony then what sent me again was my
[2:16:46] first born and my second born B and my
[2:16:48] last
[2:16:51] Bor that
[2:16:54] gone was your
[2:16:57] backslide it was not beautiful at all
[2:17:00] for me as a mother but um they keep on
[2:17:04] coming for the message books at
[2:17:07] home I now see my son when he came back
[2:17:10] for
[2:17:12] holidays he knows what the message
[2:17:15] is It prepares him for the r
[2:17:19] when he told me that I
[2:17:20] knew go God is at work I was so seated
[2:17:25] in him a message player when the pastor
[2:17:28] Seated on my daughter a message player I
[2:17:30] also acted wise like a wise parent and
[2:17:34] seated on him he lives in
[2:17:37] Nigeria and um I know that God is at
[2:17:41] work now recently also my daughter came
[2:17:44] running she prays in St John Chira
[2:17:48] she said Mommy I've never seen such a
[2:17:49] lie where is the other Seven Seals I
[2:17:52] need to prove this I also gave it to her
[2:17:56] she's also reading it at a certain point
[2:17:59] even my last Bor was a pastor you
[2:18:02] people they ordained her that she was a
[2:18:05] pastor with Dominion City churches we
[2:18:08] went on our knees and she just she just
[2:18:11] walked away from church she now knows
[2:18:14] that women are not supposed to be
[2:18:15] pastors but anyway she's still out side
[2:18:18] there but that is not the pro the the
[2:18:21] concern the concern that I know is God
[2:18:25] will bring them
[2:18:31] back I've been in this church under the
[2:18:34] guidance of Pastor taloa it has been
[2:18:37] beautiful actually he's he's old like my
[2:18:40] first daughter know when I look at him I
[2:18:43] know that I'm sitting under the
[2:18:46] leadership of a son and I'm humbled as a
[2:18:50] mother uh it taught me how to pray I
[2:18:53] just I just had to to get back to where
[2:18:56] I used to be with Pastor John chakon and
[2:18:59] I just brought it forward and I'm I'm a
[2:19:02] better person today the way you see me I
[2:19:05] am no longer
[2:19:07] emotional I don't cry I am
[2:19:11] strong sometimes you know things happen
[2:19:14] around her life have learned to pray for
[2:19:17] her
[2:19:18] the days there would come maybe an
[2:19:19] attack I know I would want to see where
[2:19:22] where is the man of God to be called
[2:19:24] these days I have a solution I just lay
[2:19:26] her on my chest and we just cast out
[2:19:29] those things so it has been beautiful
[2:19:32] knowing all of you and we are here to
[2:19:34] stay until Jesus Christ comes for
[2:19:38] us God bless you so much I have a very
[2:19:40] big testimony but we are going to share
[2:19:43] it the way you've been seeing her
[2:19:46] healing slow slowly in bits that is how
[2:19:49] our testimon is going to come God bless
[2:19:52] you so
[2:19:55] much God bless you
[2:20:00] church thank you so much for all of you
[2:20:04] Pastor I love you I always tell genes I
[2:20:06] love says Mommy I think she thinks I
[2:20:09] don't know what she imagines when I say
[2:20:11] that I love the pastor so much so I love
[2:20:14] you
[2:20:15] all I wonder she
[2:20:18] imagin so um I want to yeah apologize
[2:20:24] for the sisters who who try and and
[2:20:28] reach up to me and when maybe we are
[2:20:31] greeting you know that part where they
[2:20:32] say uh greet your your neighbor and then
[2:20:37] someone is rushing very fast so my
[2:20:40] spirit fored someone wants to greet
[2:20:42] her so I just laugh about it I be like
[2:20:46] when pastor it's just
[2:20:48] a I'm decided to believe it's a
[2:20:52] phas uh it's it's
[2:20:54] nothing and that is always I tell myself
[2:20:58] that so my dear sisters I love you just
[2:21:01] reach up to my heart and hold me it's
[2:21:05] just it's it's just a matter of time and
[2:21:08] uh the testimony will be complete
[2:21:11] because I've been in prayer and surely
[2:21:14] God
[2:21:16] doesn't reveal so many things to me and
[2:21:19] uh I believe that when Pastor every time
[2:21:21] I I when I come to church and I'm very
[2:21:24] expected that it will be that day it's
[2:21:26] going today it's going be and I
[2:21:29] encourage
[2:21:30] myself so I I'm grateful this
[2:21:35] ministry
[2:21:37] ministers you you don't know what to do
[2:21:39] to me when I'm s there my chair there I
[2:21:43] get so blessed I get peace I get Jo you
[2:21:47] know Genesis always ask me mommy why do
[2:21:50] you laugh around and I told her because
[2:21:52] God has made me happy I made is
[2:21:55] everything and I believe that God
[2:21:58] allowed it to be this way so that he
[2:22:01] could receive all the glory of H
[2:22:04] to yes and um thankful for Divine
[2:22:08] Healing I eventually understood that
[2:22:11] mine is not a miracle like boom yeah
[2:22:13] yeah Holy Spirit what so I recogniz
[2:22:25] I've been recovering every day the
[2:22:29] things I couldn't do I know I like when
[2:22:32] like brother comes and say thank you for
[2:22:34] cleaning the house now move the house so
[2:22:36] I want it and I'm sure that it's clean
[2:22:39] and U and that is good for me because my
[2:22:43] nerves get better every day I recognize
[2:22:46] that the doctors took me of medication
[2:22:49] because of the strong medication and
[2:22:52] maybe once in a while I take something
[2:22:55] and I thank God so much for things that
[2:22:58] do failed to do
[2:23:02] and
[2:23:03] I I constantly get dreams when I'm being
[2:23:07] given medication and I used to wonder
[2:23:10] why I dream when
[2:23:12] dream drug so I at I never I had
[2:23:20] pain I would dream
[2:23:23] like I
[2:23:26] appreciate the power of God that passes
[2:23:29] through dreams and makes me feel by the
[2:23:32] time I wake up I'm strong and I have
[2:23:34] hope to be again yes so my testimony is
[2:23:39] that thanking God so so much for Divine
[2:23:42] Healing he has given me joy and peace
[2:23:46] and
[2:23:48] rightous God has really
[2:23:55] well
[2:24:11] us
[2:24:13] me concerning even the healing I don't

[2:29:14] the new year but I fa to be unfair if I
[2:29:18] don't thank God for last
[2:29:20] year so what I have to thank God for is
[2:29:23] really a lot what has done for me a lot
[2:29:26] of things personally in
[2:29:28] me um maybe God has not used me to bless
[2:29:32] you yet but God has been working in me
[2:29:35] doing a lot of things changing a lot of
[2:29:36] things in me and helping me maybe what I
[2:29:40] can than good for is about my school so
[2:29:45] in
[2:29:48] and life wasn't easy I got tired of the
[2:29:52] school because I could not pray the
[2:29:54] whole
[2:29:56] time just all a month to be at school I
[2:30:00] struggle with my own prayers and then I
[2:30:02] get we in the middle something like that
[2:30:05] and I come back home when I'm dry then I
[2:30:08] start a fresh yeah the cycle continues
[2:30:12] like that every time from I think like
[2:30:15] from
[2:30:19] was but then I than that I finished and
[2:30:22] despite the mo I I still passed
[2:30:25] my so
[2:30:28] also uh going to a new school I'm still
[2:30:31] in a very strong Catholic
[2:30:34] school but nevertheless despite
[2:30:37] everything else um he has taught me a
[2:30:40] lot I have learned hard
[2:30:42] work I have
[2:30:45] learned um um how to be with people I've
[2:30:50] learned I've learned that when you want
[2:30:52] something you go for it so I've learned
[2:30:55] hard work and also I thank God for the
[2:30:58] friends I found there some of you saw my
[2:31:00] friend called Kagan so actually I had
[2:31:04] come for a movie but the movie found
[2:31:08] there I had already watched it at metrop
[2:31:11] so I told him to pass
[2:31:13] by but one thing about him is that he
[2:31:18] has always stuck around me I don't know
[2:31:21] why but I I could preach to him when we
[2:31:24] walking from class to back to host so
[2:31:28] tell him let's walk slowly I have
[2:31:30] something to tell
[2:31:31] you let's talk very fast I'm like take
[2:31:34] it slow so I would preach to him preach
[2:31:38] to him until reach that he like man
[2:31:41] prach that's how it was but I don't know
[2:31:44] why he he's not a
[2:31:47] Believer but he sticks around me too
[2:31:50] much he tells me all his plans what he
[2:31:54] has
[2:31:55] done
[2:31:57] like get me I don't even stick to him so
[2:32:01] I request so you should pray for him I
[2:32:04] don't know why he's sticking on Me Maybe
[2:32:08] maybe God needs to use him also I
[2:32:11] believe God can do something in his life
[2:32:14] I thank God for everyone was around
[2:32:18] me I've had people in my life
[2:32:22] who who are really blessed me thank God
[2:32:26] for
[2:32:27] shame his absence like when I'm at
[2:32:32] school I feel he's praying for me and
[2:32:36] prays
[2:32:37] everyone and also at school almost
[2:32:40] everyone knows sh like I talk about him
[2:32:43] every
[2:32:45] day when my friend came was like what
[2:32:49] shame and also Pastor sometimes so I
[2:32:52] thank God very
[2:32:54] much God bless
[2:33:15] you bless you
[2:33:18] Church good
[2:33:23] morning I
[2:33:25] want I want to thank
[2:33:28] God actually I I I I I wrote a paper I
[2:33:35] to give it so I gave it to give it gave
[2:33:39] it so it was good that wanted me
[2:33:42] to give this testimony
[2:33:45] Hallelujah
[2:33:47] I fa to give this testimony I was
[2:33:49] yearning for this day long long ago
[2:33:52] before
[2:33:54] even not
[2:33:57] yet God has really people God has been
[2:34:00] really good to me and whenever he could
[2:34:04] do something I could remember this that
[2:34:06] on that day I testify this okay I may
[2:34:09] have forgotten some because they were
[2:34:11] many but the the ones I remember I
[2:34:15] testify Hallelujah
[2:34:17] I want to thank God now me I will give
[2:34:20] because now me I consider all the past
[2:34:23] years as one year so as 2023 for the
[2:34:27] past years because actually I was
[2:34:29] baptized in
[2:34:30] 2023 so I consider all p as one so I
[2:34:35] want to thank God uh when we were
[2:34:40] entering sometime
[2:34:43] back I went to school and uh
[2:34:47] and I did my my my I did my
[2:34:51] certificate but when I no I first did my
[2:34:54] precour we were the Pioneers in the
[2:34:57] school then we started our certificates
[2:35:00] our
[2:35:02] Bunch when we finished our
[2:35:04] certificates they told us to upgrade to
[2:35:07] diplomas we didn't know what was going
[2:35:09] on because this was a new thing what
[2:35:11] what
[2:35:13] uh but then after the certific
[2:35:18] there was some issues and I didn't know
[2:35:21] okay even right now I ask
[2:35:25] why I didn't join I was giving an excuse
[2:35:29] that I don't have money so I didn't join
[2:35:32] to do my diploma they called me after to
[2:35:35] graduate what pained me that I was
[2:35:37] graduating a certificate and the friends
[2:35:42] and the people I studied with were
[2:35:44] graduating a diploma
[2:35:46] me I was graduating certificate but we
[2:35:49] start like we started in the same
[2:35:52] classes but I stopped at a moment then
[2:35:55] for them they continued and it was
[2:35:57] paining me for for some
[2:36:00] time I passed in through that
[2:36:03] year with that pain so when I entered
[2:36:08] 2020
[2:36:10] 2023 I thought yeah now I'm going to
[2:36:12] school but I had years that I'm going to
[2:36:15] school but when I don't know how am I
[2:36:17] going to school because the curriculum
[2:36:19] I'm using it's it's only this school
[2:36:23] that has it
[2:36:24] inand I can't go to any other school and
[2:36:26] it is so
[2:36:28] expensive so I was like now what what am
[2:36:31] I going to do when you look her this one
[2:36:35] is doing this the other one is doing the
[2:36:37] other one when you called the friends so
[2:36:40] I was really
[2:36:41] St and what I had in me I'm going back
[2:36:44] to school this year that
[2:36:48] 2023 so it came to uh actually we
[2:36:52] planned that I go back
[2:36:54] to AO AO came we came in the middle of
[2:36:58] the year in the middle of the like the
[2:37:01] year was ending and I was like H but you
[2:37:04] know maybe that's very I go next
[2:37:08] year so I was like canceling but I want
[2:37:11] to thank God that all in all people I
[2:37:13] went back to school
[2:37:19] and yeah even when I even when I went
[2:37:22] back to school things were not easy
[2:37:24] because this this is this was a thing
[2:37:27] that
[2:37:28] uh that had to be done in a big period
[2:37:32] of time like as I had planned to do it
[2:37:34] for that 2023 but I went almost when the
[2:37:38] year is ending so this people told me
[2:37:41] Dixon actually I was a special case at
[2:37:44] school so
[2:37:46] they impact me a lot of things because I
[2:37:49] think even them they had the vision that
[2:37:51] God has put in me that I have to finish
[2:37:52] it that very so they packed a lot of
[2:37:55] things on me they told me finishing it
[2:37:58] this year so I want to thank God that
[2:38:01] assessments were too much yes what what
[2:38:04] and you see they were giving me a lot of
[2:38:07] Assessments because I used to study with
[2:38:09] the students of a certificate and
[2:38:11] students of diploma sharing some units
[2:38:14] so you find that even when you're
[2:38:16] getting assessments these people of the
[2:38:18] diploma have two assessments even that

[2:38:33] I I used to come back here for every
[2:38:35] weekend so people used to to use that
[2:38:37] time of weekend to make what what but me
[2:38:40] I'm always here
[2:38:42] so things were not easy but
[2:38:46] God made them Hallelujah actually
[2:38:50] actually if I'm not if I'm not
[2:38:53] forgetting uh can I say last year
[2:38:56] yesterday at
[2:38:59] night when I was sleeping I was there
[2:39:02] and I I I remember that I Dre my that we
[2:39:06] had come back you know people you need
[2:39:09] to pray for
[2:39:12] me I dream that Mar had come back
[2:39:16] you see uh actually people thought
[2:39:18] because at school actually I was
[2:39:21] uh every time actually every time I had
[2:39:24] I used to give it for God like in the
[2:39:27] evening after classes we we uh there's
[2:39:32] some time for sports they told me Dix
[2:39:35] don't want to see you in sports for you
[2:39:37] have to be in the computer room only you
[2:39:39] actually there some moments when the
[2:39:40] school closes the computer room but for
[2:39:42] me they told me you have to be inside
[2:39:45] and do your work because me I used to
[2:39:46] have work already uh but there is this
[2:39:49] evening time after after after dinner so
[2:39:53] now that time people could use it to do
[2:39:56] some projects you know do their work uh
[2:39:59] research make researches watch videos on
[2:40:02] YouTube what what but now me I used to
[2:40:05] gather them and
[2:40:07] uh they tell me but now this is the time
[2:40:10] you could read you have to read your
[2:40:12] books now again you're using it in other
[2:40:14] things so I used to gather them get in
[2:40:16] the DH SE on a on a table and share
[2:40:21] Hallelujah so I want to thank God
[2:40:22] actually for that group of mind that I
[2:40:25] had uh they really they were really uh
[2:40:29] and I say people of God because whatever
[2:40:33] I could bring they could accept it you
[2:40:36] know sometimes when we have the message
[2:40:38] and you want to give it to someone you
[2:40:40] have that what do they accept what would
[2:40:42] they accept but whatever I could bring
[2:40:44] even sometimes I bring it out uh it all
[2:40:49] someone knocks out something that you
[2:40:51] want to bring out and then you are like
[2:40:53] oh wow so I want to thank God even for
[2:40:55] that bnch of mind that they were really
[2:40:58] touched
[2:40:59] okay
[2:41:01] um I want to thank God for for this for
[2:41:05] that first year that
[2:41:08] uh my life my life has really changed
[2:41:12] you know I was baptized by the way
[2:41:16] people me I was I was born in a
[2:41:18] Pentecostal CH my my parents were
[2:41:21] pcal yeah my parents were Pentecostal so
[2:41:24] I I was grown out in that so when I had
[2:41:28] this message and
[2:41:30] uh yeah I thought it's it's the it's the
[2:41:34] what actually when Pastor was giving a
[2:41:37] testimony about his life sometime he
[2:41:39] spoke and said when he was going
[2:41:41] to to to where he where I used to go for
[2:41:45] School in that family where he used to
[2:41:47] come from
[2:41:49] that uh his her mother told him that uh
[2:41:55] that uh where are you going those people
[2:41:57] have things they believe they believe
[2:41:59] this and this so it's the same thing
[2:42:02] that happened to me when I was coming uh
[2:42:06] when I was
[2:42:08] coming when I was
[2:42:11] coming my dad told
[2:42:13] me uh you going
[2:42:15] but those people believe this and this
[2:42:18] okay so that was my first time so when I
[2:42:22] came actually they told me the very
[2:42:25] things but now when they told me the
[2:42:27] things and the things were that message
[2:42:30] me when they told them to me I felt this
[2:42:33] is
[2:42:33] me this this is that these are the facts
[2:42:37] actually I was like the people didn't
[2:42:39] understand them well because when I went
[2:42:41] back
[2:42:43] after after getting off the body
[2:42:45] in fact even before greeting they was
[2:42:47] like you people did you understand the
[2:42:49] things then I started explaining like
[2:42:51] what I knew these
[2:42:53] [Laughter]
[2:42:58] people these people had that had the
[2:43:01] different mindset so I want to thank God
[2:43:04] that mine is again different from theirs
[2:43:06] so I'm
[2:43:14] different
[2:43:28] God bless you church happy New Year to
[2:43:30] you
[2:43:32] all I'm called
[2:43:36] Samuel and yeah I just wanted to give a
[2:43:39] a long testimony but I also don't know
[2:43:42] how long but I think it's long
[2:43:52] I want God for my
[2:43:54] life
[2:43:57] from let me
[2:43:59] sa okay I want to thank God for lot he
[2:44:02] has done in my
[2:44:04] life many
[2:44:06] protection this life that I have never
[2:44:10] know because okay me there are times
[2:44:13] when I like I can remember something
[2:44:16] that happened some time back and I'm
[2:44:17] like thank
[2:44:19] God that's why I think my testimony is
[2:44:21] going to be long because there many
[2:44:23] things you just reach a party then you
[2:44:25] remember
[2:44:27] like okay there are people who die at
[2:44:30] Young
[2:44:31] ages and me being here right now I don't
[2:44:35] know CU there are many things that have
[2:44:42] happened okay but another thing what I
[2:44:45] one than about is my school from when I
[2:44:50] started school I
[2:44:52] think they have never told me to go back
[2:44:55] home for school fees
[2:44:58] or every time when I go to school get
[2:45:02] almost every almost everything that I
[2:45:04] want and I go to school and I
[2:45:07] study
[2:45:10] and I thank
[2:45:12] God for last

[3:03:46] me I went for a
[3:03:49] very
[3:03:51] very vigorous
[3:03:55] course I know few of you may
[3:03:57] know or many I don't
[3:04:02] know but I went for a very vigorous
[3:04:04] course that some
[3:04:07] people have
[3:04:09] to had
[3:04:11] to be casuality
[3:04:15] some people had to
[3:04:17] die but I'm here

[3:04:44] but I assure
[3:04:47] you if you only trust
[3:04:53] God in that hard
[3:04:57] moment it's when God is more
[3:05:02] closer in that hardest
[3:05:07] moment just you
[3:05:10] talking just a talk it may you may think
[3:05:12] you're not
[3:05:14] pray but just the talk just you
[3:05:19] talking God no I don't like this one no
