[17:44] and when I beheld law they say news and
[17:48] the flesh Came Upon them and the skin
[17:51] covered them above but there was no
[17:53] breath in them then said he unto me
[17:56] prophesy unto the wind
[17:59] prophesy son of man and say to the wind
[18:02] thus saith the Lord God come from the
[18:06] Four Winds o breath and breathe upon

[18:16] the breath came into them and they lived
[18:18] and stood up upon their feet and

[28:28] you may be in that Valley this morning
[28:32] but this service is meant to encourage
[28:38] I may be in that Valley this morning
[28:42] but listen to me now he believes the
[28:45] spirit of God is here this morning
[28:48] to do something in your life are you on
[28:51] a backwards you can never come in your
[28:54] life and you remain the same
[28:59] and the spirit of the Lord carried
[29:01] Ezekiel and took him in a valley full of
[29:03] dry bones
[29:06] him to pass by them around above
[29:11] there were very many in the open valleys
[29:24] and here this scripture read it one time
[29:29] as a pastor in Ethiopia that little
[29:31] church starting up
[29:34] and this sister was going through she
[29:37] had gone a lot of uh through a lot of
[29:39] problems in her life
[29:42] and since she believed the message it
[29:45] seemed as if God was not working for her
[29:49] she was going through a lot of trouble
[29:52] and you know Financial constraints
[29:56] problems on every side
[29:59] came to me in the office
[30:02] crying
[30:04] I was a young Pastor I did not know what
[30:08] to do in such instances
[30:29] but you see what would help if the
[30:33] spirit of the Lord came in the room
[30:35] when the spirit of Lord comes in your
[30:37] life he makes a difference
[30:40] that very moment
[30:42] I closed my I was sitting back in my
[30:45] chair and she was messy all over there
[30:48] the other side of the of the bench
[30:51] I just sat back in tour and I closed my
[30:55] eyes because I was trying to feel what
[30:57] she was going on
[30:59] I was trying to relate what with what
[31:01] she's going through
[31:03] and at that very moment the spirit of
[31:07] the Lord came in the room
[31:08] I tell you whenever the spirit of the
[31:10] Lord comes in the room
[31:16] something always happens
[31:23] not not a god of doctrines only
[31:27] he's a God that comes out from the pages
[31:30] of the Bible
[31:32] it comes into reality
[31:40] for sure and again he is not just a more
[31:43] that we are worshiping
[31:45] is
[31:48] a living God
[31:51] and at that moment I experience this
[31:54] power
[31:55] began to carry me
[31:58] up in the dreams of Revelation
[32:01] and you know things began to open up
[32:05] this scripture came in my mind
[32:09] I didn't even know I I don't remember I
[32:11] had not rehearsed it against it but I I
[32:14] told the sister
[32:16] the word of God says
[32:28] but you see my sister
[32:31] he is asking you this question is
[32:53] but why did he ask as a kid
[32:56] because he wanted to know yeah
[33:24] [Music]
[33:51] he wants you to be involved in the
[33:54] Miracles
[33:56] in the miracle of the transformation of
[33:58] Our Lives
[34:19] don't just lay there come on
[34:26] anointed
[34:31] what do you say
[34:36] here is the situation of your life
[34:42] not what God says
[34:48] will you remain like that or can God
[34:51] move you and do something new in your
[34:53] life
[34:58] and Ezekiel was lying there as a kid
[35:00] yeah you know that reminds me what
[35:01] happened with Moses
[35:03] when he reached the Red Sea he started
[35:07] crying
[35:11] the Egyptians
[35:19] Moses why do you cry
[35:25] there is a lot more in you than you know
[35:28] your mind that's why a Believer must
[35:31] never speak either word
[35:35] that's why I do not always like jesting
[35:38] and laughing about things
[35:43] whether I'm going through a bad
[35:45] situation
[35:46] I always say I am rich
[35:49] and actually even in real life many
[35:51] people think I have a lot more than what
[35:53] I really have in animals
[35:56] whatever I prophesy in my life it
[35:59] happens
[36:03] foreign
[36:30] [Music]
[36:32] let me tell you we need to learn to
[36:34] speak to the storms
[36:39] the scripture says
[36:41] death and life are in the power of the
[36:44] past
[36:49] tell your neighbors amen
[36:58] it's not the time is the confession of
[37:02] the past
[37:03] and it's not a tongue that will do it
[37:06] because it is the spirit of the Lord
[37:09] which is going to come and follow the
[37:11] words of a
[37:17] Believers
[37:24] and here you know there's power man yet
[37:28] in the tongue
[37:29] and as I began to speak to that sister I
[37:33] spoke to her and said what do you say
[37:36] about the situation why do you cry can
[37:41] you live again
[37:42] God restore you attack to your glory
[37:46] all this money that is lost all this
[37:50] business all your life
[37:56] and I said my sister what do you say
[37:58] professor
[38:15] prophesy to the bones
[38:18] hallelujah amen
[38:20] prophesied with his bones
[38:31] then saith the Lord thus saith the Lord
[38:34] God unto this born
[38:39] regular
[38:42] [Music]
[39:26] it God followed those who were tattoos
[39:32] and the first time you prophesied there
[39:35] was a noise
[39:38] and the bones came together
[39:43] everything was not yet perfect
[39:45] because there was no life
[39:52] and all the same news
[39:54] they also developed the flesh Came Upon
[39:57] him
[39:59] let me tell you my brother my sister
[40:03] I'm gonna take you through your
[40:05] situation
[40:11] do not rush the process
[40:20] God does not see you as a failure
[40:26] God
[40:30] see you I sees you as a perfect bride
[40:35] a perfect job
[41:37] hallelujah amen your parents can failure
[41:43] your friends
[42:18] it can never happen
[42:22] foreign
[42:40] and at that moment you can say that I
[42:43] spoke through this system
[42:49] she had come from Dubai and worked there
[42:52] many many years
[42:55] and made a lot of money
[42:58] when she returned back to Ethiopia
[43:01] you know all these pastors the fake
[43:04] pastors
[43:07] in the name of frost prophecies
[43:10] you know you're gonna get married she
[43:13] wasn't married
[43:18] she she she didn't have money all that
[43:22] money was lost
[43:27] she became frustrated
[43:31] [Music]
[43:33] situation
[43:39] it seemed as if God was not coming
[43:41] through foreign
[43:46] that he will come through for you
[43:51] then that is not faith is on the basis
[43:55] of believing without seeing okay
[43:59] hoping without knowing
[44:01] knowing this one thing in your heart
[44:04] what he said is good enough for me
[44:08] I may not feel it I cannot say it I may
[44:13] not smell it because
[45:25] foreign
[45:49] I know
[46:54] she was all
[47:12] um
[47:37] you are going to get a job not in a very
[47:40] long time
[47:42] it's going to be a powerful day
[47:46] and if this doesn't happen
[47:48] I will repent yeah
[47:51] and I will confess it to everybody
[47:53] because these are not my words
[48:11] two weeks
[48:13] one two weeks we came in 14 days
[48:18] God ended a suffering that was for more
[48:21] than 30 years
[48:27] chick
[48:29] long story short and she was asked a
[48:32] question
[48:35] how much do you want to earn oh yeah
[48:39] and she spoke any amount she thought it
[48:40] was the largest
[48:43] [Music]
[48:47] sin and they told her welcome on board
[48:52] and they gave her the job a big American
[48:56] company
[48:58] they wanted someone who was qualified
[49:02] none of the people that were sent
[49:05] that we are qualified in paper
[49:08] actually went through
[49:11] but the one that wasn't qualified
[49:14] she didn't have any papers
[49:18] she was given the job
[49:23] and she had that job enough for more
[49:26] than three or four years
[49:33] God gave her a husband mommy God gave
[49:37] her a family
[49:40] foreign
[49:47] prophesy to the bones
[49:50] as believer Believers need to come to a

[1:42:30] never watched that that skid or that
[1:42:31] movie go and watch it
[1:42:36] what is it called
[1:42:40] operation Thunderbolt Thunderbird
[1:42:43] operation Thunderbolt go and watch it it
[1:42:47] was one of the greatest operations
[1:42:54] without our others detecting them
[1:43:00] and they took their people
[1:43:02] before I mean
[1:43:04] would realize
[1:43:11] praise the name of the Lord one of the
[1:43:13] greatest
[1:43:15] operations
[1:43:18] and that's not the only one they have
[1:43:21] done many operations
[1:43:24] there's one they did in um I don't know
[1:43:27] how they call it the country um
[1:43:29] one of the Arab Nations
[1:43:32] that wanted to
[1:43:34] um
[1:43:35] yes somebody knows it
[1:43:38] no
[1:43:39] that wanted to do a a nuclear bomb what
[1:43:42] yes
[1:43:43] yes Iran
[1:43:46] they wanted to make it
[1:43:49] Iran Irani is actually what we see here
[1:43:54] in the Bible
[1:43:56] and they have always wanted to inhalate
[1:43:59] and highlight Israel Buddhism
[1:44:05] and so their purpose was actually
[1:44:09] a child to remove Israel from the mouth
[1:44:13] but the way IDF infiltrated
[1:44:24] and it's not the beginning if you
[1:44:26] believe in the Bible and you take this
[1:44:27] Bible is the Bible you know this summer
[1:44:29] you will find many operations
[1:44:32] but you will always find it in their
[1:44:35] operation why they were able to pull it
[1:44:37] off
[1:44:40] why they were able to pull it over to be
[1:44:42] successful
[1:44:43] is because there was always another
[1:44:46] General behind them
[1:44:48] is
[1:44:54] God himself for the Bible says is the
[1:44:58] Mighty God
[1:44:59] great in battle
[1:45:02] don't we always sing that song
