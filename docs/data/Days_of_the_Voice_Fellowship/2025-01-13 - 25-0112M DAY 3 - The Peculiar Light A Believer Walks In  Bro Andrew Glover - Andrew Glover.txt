[Music] am please be seated for just a moment we have a lot of testimonies coming through I just want to share maybe two or three and then share a prayer request we just put your heart as you Minister brother uh there's a testimony that came from one of the sisters as I think Pastor in the morning was ministering uh she prayed and believed um for God she said Okay God if this works I know there is a certain piece of land my sister so Lord make it work for her if you do it I also believe going to do it for me according to the information I received as I speak now she she already her sister already has a land title of that piece of land and she did not pay for it uh I understand it is something connected to the government and all that I do not know the details God granted their desire and so she's also believing that God is also going to Grant her desire there is a sister in one of the services swollen swollen legs you know God healed instantly in the meeting after you ministered uh Pastor Sean after you ministered you left some kind of fire here and uh you know there's a young man that was sick and here is the test I just read it say God bless you Saints I GRE you all in the name of of the most high God I thank God who has Set Me Free from the sto I even failed to take my lunch because the pain was too severe but during this praise and dancing unto the Lord after the word was preached by Pastor Sean I realized that I wasn't feeling the pain anymore amen and and he says hallelujah praise be the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you all it's not just this is not like the dancing they do in the club where demon enter them remember that little talked about you know just said let me let me go and here let me she was passing let me hear what I used to do and before she realized it she was in the arms of a man and demons had entered her and she she went out quickly went woke up brother Bram and you know when they met with Brother Bram try to fight and brother cast them out they came out to attack brother and the part that was so funny for me there was another person there you know the demons who went at him so he took off demons are real and the Holy Spirit is real so so when we are when we are dancing praising worshiping it's not just singing and feelings and emotions Anyway said anything religion without emotion is and I'm so glad our religion has emotion and the Holy Spirit is not emotional but he is emotional amen praise the name of the Lord amen and there's this prayer request that I will share as we prepare to invite brother brother Glover appreciate I appreciate God for all your lives and the seal he has put in your hearts request you all to pray for my son who has a bipolar [Music] problem mental illness uh that he gets totally healed secondly he's trying to go to a different denomination I declare that he remains in the message and my other Sons I don't have name [Music] but I believe that your needs are heard before the Lord am and God will do it for you my sister I don't know whether you are here but I know God will take that into account in this service uh I would like to at this time say that I really appreciate all the pastors that have come here to be with us um I know there others who have been streaming online those who have been able to make it to come and support us we sincerely appreciate amen amen um the ones

church in I believe it's more than a thousand just for him to be here for the for for this for all these days it's a big sacrifice and so we really appreciate you so much you know brother Glover as he is going to come to the pulpit uh just a few days to the trip which he had planned to do he had several appointments with the doctor and you know he travels quite a bit and ministers many places you know there let me tell you there are many people around the world would want to have this man Minister you know because of the Ministries that God has given gift and so he told me I may not be able to make it after where is my phone I want to read the message I sent him I I I sent it by faith and I'll just read a part of it for you here praise the Lord amen hope this this is okay and you know he told me he would not be able to come and uh him these are personal details I may not tell you about the condition he had and all that so I told him I'm sorry to hear about that but I said the Lord

thank you for coming thank you so much let us on our Fe and invite to come and Minister this is the last service so let God have his way let God have his way whatever else that has not happened will happen in this service amen amen why don't you just meditate about all the things that God has done throughout these meetings and now we have reached at this moment the climax of the whole [Music] meetings and as we prepare to hear from the from the mind of God if you feel that there's something that God has not yet done for you don't pack up already and say maybe the next time maybe this is your service may the Lord grant it for you begin to pray now in your spirit amen and tell him Lord as the man of God comes to take the P speak about me discern my situation minister to my heart use

therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him how many has received Christ how many has received more of Christ now Paul has given you a Divine instruction Walk In Christ whom you have received in the book of First Peter the second chapter First Peter chapter 2 First Peter chapter 2 verse number n amen Paul here writing or Peter rather First Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 he says now now ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that she should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous [Music] Light which in time pass were nauy people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy amen we ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word you may have your seats here tonight I am thankful for the message of the hour I have to say I am thankful that it's not just an American message it's not just an African message or european message amen but it's a Heavenly message and since it's a Heavenly message amen we receive the benefits of Heaven no one gets more benefits than the other we are beneficiaries of the message of the hour now I want to speak to you tonight on this thought peculiarity of light the believer walks in can you repeat it brother The Peculiar light the believer walks in when you read 1 John chapter 1 the Bible will say in first John chapter 1 the Bible says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and we walk in darkness then we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as in the life we have Fellowship one with the other and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin now when you read in the Amplified Bible says but if we really walk in the life that is we live each and every day in the Conformity with the precepts of God as he himself is in the L we have true unbroken fellowship with one another he with us and we with him and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin by erasing the stain of sin and keeping cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations you all are very well aware we have just come out of an old year and we have come into a new year we have come out of 2024 and we have come into 2025 in 195 6 brother Rand preaches a sermon on New Year's Day and he entitles it why are people why are people so tossed about now not that in this the new year but it's the new turn of time he says I believe we are living in a very wonderful glorious State it's a wonderful glorious day of opportunity when the people of this they are living to see the Shadows of the coming of the Son of God he said I believe with all of my heart that the world is going to burst now into the greatest Revival that was ever known or it's going into the darkest chaos that's ever been known in history now you all know that 1956 was a very significant year in the ministry of William very significant year in the history of the world because it was the year the world would accept the gospel or they would reject the gospel and the prophet of God said it's a wonderful day he said now this is your time to make a decision on what you're going to do now how many knows that the world decided to turn down the Gospel of Jesus Christ America rejected a prophet's Ministry but what I love about what a prophet is saying is that the world's decision has nothing to do with the believer's decision see the world turned the message down the world rejected the gospel he said but if there happens to be someone here today who hasn't made the decision right for Christ he said I trust this morning you say yes Lord this is the day I my decision to serve you the rest of my life it's a wonderful day I'm sure that our eyes has been just even Believers even Believers we can see what's going on around us and many times spiritual L people are misunderstood to the people of the world because it's such a strange and in our life to live a full surrender life to the Lord Jesus if you are a Believer you have been called by God out of the darkness into this marvelous line as Believers we have to accept this fact we are going to be peculiar we are going to be oddballs we are going to be strange all said I am become a fool glor he has compelled me for have been commended of you for nothing am I behind the very Chief Apostles the very Chief Apostles amen though I be nothing now here Paul is saying that I am a fool I am a fool to the world because I do not use the world can I say something to you the wisdom of the world is foolishness to the believer wisdom of God is foolishness to the world see then I'll say this tonight I am not ashamed to be called an oddball an oddball is a fool it is a person that really has lost their mind so you have to be somebody's fool I would rather be a fool for Christ because God said that his people were a peculiar people they were odd they were peculiar they were odd they were chosen they are elected they are royal priesthood they are offering spiritual sacrifices to God that is the fruit of their lips giving praise to his name see I have not forgot that I am a gentile who was called by Grace the lineage of Jesus Christ therefore I have got to give God praise without him I would not be here in sermon why our people so tossed about prophet of God says he says I want you to notice another thing about this it is the peculiar light of the believer that walks in the peculiar of the light the believer walks in when he is in Christ the peculiarity of it amen I'm lost the believer Walks In A peculiar life I'll say this not only is a Believer peculiar but the food that a Believer eats is peculiar and the light that they walk in is PE now I'll say this we have come out of different walks of life every individual sitting here has come out of a different Walk of Life maybe some of you were raised in church maybe some of you were raised in the message maybe some of you come out of the world some of you come from another country we're all gathered here and we all come out of different walks of life the prophet of God said Lord you have taken alcoholics prostitutes you have taken drug ad and you have brought them out of every Walk of Life and made ladies and gentlemen out of them now you know why you came out it's because you're a part of EX and exodus means called out called out means the church and now God is calling his people out of every Walk of Life to come and receive and to believe on him now let me say this there is a difference in a Christian walk modern Christian walk is difference in the Walk of the believer and the walk of a modern Christian you know the Walk of a modern Christian is Dreadful in the eyes of God but we ought to alter ourselves to walk with God thisen that word peculiar odd usual an feat you have anage characteristic or a quality that is distinctive of a particular person or place it is the quality or the state of being peculiar so if you are oddc that means you have strange habits you have strange features see the world has a religious habit they go to church they sing a song they hear a sermon and they go out the door and they live the same way that they did before they went but they believer into Christ and he receives Christ and then he begins to walk Christ he has received Christ this is more than a youth this is more than a f service or a Sunday morning service this is a walk amen I'm talking to you we're getting ready to leave this Camp it's more than it's got to be more than just shouting at the altar it's got to be more than just dancing in the spirit it's got to be more than just screaming there has got to come a walk there has got to come A Walk to this there is got to come a progression there is a feature in your life listen the world has habits the world has features but the world's habits are not the habits of the believer the world's features are not the features of the believer I have some habits can I tell you about my habits I go to church I read my Bible I pray I love God I sing I worship I believe the message I preach what a prophet I stand on the sayth the Lord listen I have some odd habits things are going good I praise God and when things are going bad I praise God when I'm on the mountain I praise God when I'm in the valley I praise God because I'm not a modern Christian I am a believer who has been called out of Darkness Into The Marvelous if we are a Believer then the believer walks somebody say the believer walks nudge your neighbor been po your neighbor you might have to wake him up but tell him the believer W the believer don't sit the believer don't quit the believer don't turn around the believer don't give in The Believer don't give up the believer don't say I can't make it the believer don't have a negative testimony the believer don't have a negative confession the believer Walks In A peculiar life if if we're going to walk in light we got to have light I say we have light we have the prophesy mind Zechariah 14 he said in the evening time it shall be line listen if you're going to walk in the line you got to step in the line do you know the prophet of God said when you step in the L the promises of God become real to you some me say once you have stepped in the L amen can I tell you something once you have stepped in the line it's time to put your walking shoes home when you have stepped in the line it is time to put your walking shoes on I said it's time to put your walking shoes on you say why am I putting my walking shoes on because you're going to walk well you preacher amen I don't believe in walking a Believer walks can I say something to you can you have them put his microphone in my ear they could take it completely out amen when a Believer walks believer don't does not wear shoes unfitting for the thing they're doing if you're going to play soccer you don't wear dress shoes if you're going to play soccer you wear athletic because you've got to wear shoes that are fitting to what you're about to do they say what kind of shoes do you wear to church I wear walking shoes to church Andrew why do you wear walking shoes because I'm getting ready to walk when I hear the word and I receive the word I believe the word I'm going to walk in what I have heard see the Bible says that we are to walk in the light the prophet of God said when you see the light walk in it when you see the [Applause] light amen when you see the light amen walk in the light he said walk you don't know where you're going but just keep walking amen walking towards Calvary keeping a sensible look at Calvary amen just keep walking amen amen do we have a microphone amen I amen we just keep walking brother said walk he said walk towards Calvary walk towards your Victory that's brother brother that's perfect leave it alone walk towards Calvary I love what a prophet said he said let's get on our walking Sho see God has called us out of different walks of life the Believers walk we are children of the L are not the children of Darkness the

whatever you put the your that have I given you as an inheritance my then we are progressing but we are progressing to Perfection we are going on to Perfection this when brother preach why why are people so tossed about he said there's two phases of Christianity he said there is a he said an intellectual conception you know what he said he said there's an experimental experience he said there's an intellectual conception then there's an experimental experience you know what I find I find that there is a mind and there is a soul and the prophet of God said are very much in disagreement with each other many times the prophet of God so beautifully he took time to break this and what he did was he brought a view of the Old Testament the church the children of Israel how many knows that there are three courts and then there's an outer Court there's an inner court and then there's a Hol of holies you know in the outer Court in the inner court and in the holies of holies there was light each one was different types but said in the outer Court he said the Justified man he walks by daylight he said you're his child what kind of life for you live he said what kind of life is he walking in walk according to outside the gloy and the poy the halfway amen a bright day day the cloud comes over the side he said he's walking but he's walking underneath the control of weather light so can I say this he wakes up on Sunday morning and he opens the shades and he sees the sun shining and he sees no clouds in the sky and he says praise God we're going to have chch there's no clouds there's no rain there's no there's nothing we're going to have church today and he starts to church but the next Sunday he wakes up it opens the wi and it's cloudy and it's rainy and it's foggy and there's no sunshine and he says well I'm going to go to church and I don't know what I'm going to get out of can I tell you what that is that is walking by the lck of the can move to amen then you can move into another Court still not in my ear then you can move into another Court in the other court there is a different kind of life so you move from the weather and you move to the Candlestick which means there's got to be a priest who present to light the candle if you're going to have light you got to have somebody present to light the candle so you move from weather life into man control of the life so you know what that means that means if your favorite preachers in town you can have a good service but if your favorite preacher is not in town then you can't have church because you're living by the control of the wi of a man there is an outer court that is controlled by the weather there is an inner court that is controlled by man but then there is the holies of holies and in the holies of holies brother B said it's the he said if the neighbor about you it don't matter what Happ you will trust in the word of God because you are a word born believer you are a word Christian let me say this I'm not living by the weather livs I'm not living by the man light I am living by the sh Glory means when I'm in Camp I'm in Revival when I'm out of Camp I'm in Revival when I'm on the

an outcome the Bible said this is my expectation you know what the word expectation means it means outcome outcome now I got to studying that word one day and I looked up in the dictionary and I found a real good definition for the word outcome but for once in my life I was smarter than Webster came up with a better way to define the word outcome just rearrange it out come turn it around says come [Music] out so I can tell you tonight you're coming out you're coming out of you're coming out of this world you're coming out of this civilization you're coming out of this Kingdom are going into the rapture we are going into the I'm just going to say it as plain as I know how we are walking in truth do you know the spoken word is the Original Seed you know there were three kinds of seeds you know there was a denominational seed and it was sown by Billy Graham Billy Graham there was a Pentecostal seed that was swn by or Roberts which led into a charismatic Prosperity movement but then there was a spoken word seed which was the entire seed of the Bible that was to be sown The Believer by the message of therefore we are not denominational seed we are not Pentecostal seed we are not charismatic seed we are not a bun of prosperity preacher seed we are the seed of the word spoken word of God has been spoken in this age been spoken this generation what are you saying I'm saying the seed was spoken the word seed was spoken to bring the church out ofal age adoption it's it's a it's a powerful shouting is not the adoption can I say it to youm the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not the adoption I cannot help what men think about it what men teach about it there was a message of Malachi 4 which was the fourth light so a Believer walks in life and the only a True Believer walk they to walk in the propes lot of the age the of this age was an adoption say something to you and the adoption is the word some say well just get born again and get the Holy Ghost that fix everything I believe in a new birth but I believe in an adoption he said well preacher you can't preach that brother Brandon preaches a sermon because you must be born again he reads St John 3 and Ephesians 4 brother buzi for a long time I wondered why did he read John 3 and then Ephesians 4 but he gives us a he gives us a term he says spiritual growth so there's a birth and there's a growth into an adoption there is a growth into an adoption I canot tell you what this adoption does this adoption brings a character oh my this adoption brings a character this adoption does not just bring a power it brings a character because power apart from character is satanic come on church that's how come the Pentecostals can have the power they can prophesy things they can speak things in and it never comes to pass because it's a satanic can I preach can I preach am it may get Cloud but stay with me can I prach brother brandom says if a man says something's coming to pass in the name of the Lord and it does not happen he said that man has Spirit on he's got a devil on him and needs to be cast out do you know how that Pentecostal charismatic preachers can make false prophecies it's because they got the power got no character because the only thing that brings character is the word and the word is the adoption I say we have seen the manifestation of a birth and adoption in Willam Mary and BR we seen a manifestation the power of a birth and the power of an adoption son God can I tell you what brother never he never used the spoken word for personal game he never used the sced the light he was walking in personal game you realize he could have called oh God it's getting tight can I preach brother Sean amen amen can I say something to you he could have called White House he could have called the government of America because the power of the gift that was in his life and tell them who the next president was going to be but he never done it you know why because he said it would not benefit the kingdom of God he never used his adoption character to a name for himself he never used his adoption character to build his ministry up as a matter of fact in one of the most powerful sermons we have on the subject of the third pool is a tape called humble thyself my goodness brother humble thyself you really mean the third pull if that's the real third pool it's going to bring a humility can I say this we seen the third pull and it was manifested in a prophet's Ministry can I tell you what he done he squirrels into his he gave a fish back its life he Stoke a tumor away from his wife he forgave a young couple on the for making out the meeting come on church he gave had R her two boys up out of a wheelchair he prayed for Georg Carter can I tell you what a prophet done he preached the Seven Seals trust he stood on a platform and said maybe I'm just feeling this way but if he will the L come and take the book and open the seals he stood on a platform as a human being torn in sin by sexual desire but he had a birth he had a birth the water and the blood and the spirit but he didn't stop walking the Earth he started walking into a he into a character he walked into a manifestation hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he preached the godhead he Ser seed he did all kinds of things brother ROM did all kinds of powerful superal things I show you the manifestation of the adoption character of the word in his life he comes to the end of his ministry and you know what he says he says these words he said Lord it wasn't me that done it I was just standing there when you done it my goodness he never took credit for her boys he never took credit for taking the tumor out of sister body you know why because he was the son of God who been under the tutorship of the Holy Ghost what to do with the word he sayth the Lord you know what he said he said if he had it so will this bride amen I'm going to tell you right now I'm not ignorant I know that Devil's pressing against me right now but I will not back up I will not Lay My Sword Down dangerous spot I got a sword he was a son under the character of the word can I show you his character can I show you his character as he was walking with God he went over to or Roberts University university he walked into or Roberts office do you realize that or Robert's Ministry strong off of William brandom's Ministry do you realize the messenger that sold the Pentecostal seed his ministry was inspired by brother said brother Gideon he said I went over one day to look at his office he said it was a beautiful office he said there was a marble desk he said there was all kinds of gold and silver he said I walked I walked out of that office and he said I bowed my head and I said Lord here's some man who started off with my Ministry and what he said Lord maybe you cannot trust me with this he said here I am I've got a little desk a little typewriter the corner of a trailer maybe you can't trust me with this he said but then I heard of those well I'll shout by myself and I heard a voice that was the same voice spoke to him when he was caring water to the mo steel that was the same voice that appeared on the Ohio Riv the same voice that told him do not smoke do not drink do not defile your body anyway you know what that voice said that voice said look up that voice said look up that voice said look up you know what he said he said I looked up and he said I heard the Lord say this I am your portion that marble desk is not your portion up oh God that fancy office is not your

message and we have been put in a Rapture condition and day soon we are waiting for the resurrection morning because we have believed this truth because we have believed this word because we have
