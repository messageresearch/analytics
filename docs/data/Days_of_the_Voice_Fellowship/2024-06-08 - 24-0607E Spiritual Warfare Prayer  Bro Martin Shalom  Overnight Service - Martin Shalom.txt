use this motor lips Lord Jesus to speak your Oracle tonight May the sharing you're going to share loving Master give each one of us us Lord the grace to pray for lord your word is Dependable that's why we are reading it and we are leaning on that Lord Jesus precious father King of Kings may you take the full preeminence in this service that Lord by the end of the service Lord each one of us will have a testimony in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against princip ities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of the world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your Lear God about with the truth and having on your breastplate of right rightousness and your faith showed with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able able you shall be able to quench all the F DS of the wicked and take the element of Salvation And The Sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and washing there with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen then we read Revelation chapter 12 vers 7 We Begin from s to 12 and there was a war in heaven Michel and his Angel fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his Angel and prevailed not neither was there a place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out in the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of uh and the power of His Christ for the auser of Brethren is cast down which aused them before our God day and night and they overcame then they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives un death therefore Rejoice ye heaven and ye that dwelleth in them W to the inhabitant of the earth and and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great Wrath because he knoweth that he haveth but a short time lord Jesus we thank you for the scripture reading we ask you that Lord you bless this word in the most precious name of the Lord that Lord you circumcise our ears in our heart and I pray that father you give me the inspiration in Jesus name we pray amen blessed be the name of the Lord may take your seats praise be to God I welcome you once again in the presence of the Lord Brother you're most welcome my sister most welcome yeah we're glad to see all of you sister Stella sister Isa and all of you your most welcome praise be to God yeah tonight uh since it's a prayer night uh I'm going to talk about prayer I know we always talk about it because that's what has brought us here amen yeah I'm going to talk about Warfare in prayers amen or call it prayer Warfare something of that kind amen yeah I thank the Lord those who have been uh whove been praying for us that uh this evening God has blessed us with a baby girl and thank you for your [Applause] prayer my wife she still at the hospital but they're in good condition and uh hopefully God willing tomorrow maybe be discharged in the morning amen yeah remember brother Brian in prayer uh yesterday I met uh the wife at uh at the hospital and uh I've been communicating to him for those who does not know brother Brian hope you know him he always sits in front here with a wife there's a young sister who always sits they always sit in front she uh I had yesterday she had uh according to what I heard that the pressure was high so she was taken to the hospital she's pregnant as well well and I was when I tried to ask I was told that I think she's like 8 months and 8 and a half so there is a suggestion the doctor since yesterday they saying that they are preferring that maybe they would do she she would maybe go under operation okay it's not clear because according to what the brother say like you know nowadays they you know how the doctors make money out of that but I believe that we stand in prayer for the will of God butam says God heals through Operation God heals through uh through medicine through music and so we let us pray that the will of God be done because it's not easy since yesterday up to now they still uh I was told this evening that brother mul has going to check on them so we hope that everything will be okay amen yeah shall we turn to let us go straight to the word uh I'm going to talk about spiritual or warfare prayers amen praise be to God and you know uh the way we fight our battles we don't fight physically because the Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but we are fighting against spiritual amen we are fighting against spirit that's why the Bible tells us uh that a caral person is enemity to God because God is spirit and those who worship God they must worship Him in spirit blessed be the name of the Lord and the reason asked why God want us to worship Him in spirit because we are fighting against spirit amen and if you are caral you're not going to fight you are going to lose the battle because you are fighting against invisible forces praise be to God Amen and we shall see some examples in the Bible and we shall look at the disciples and some few few examples blessed be the name of the Lord amen and where we have read in uh in Ephesians we are seeing Ephesians chapter 6 from vers 12 it says that for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities amen against the powers and against the rulers of Darkness of this world Amen there is a ruler of this world and the Bible describes him as the ruler of Darkness amen again spiritual wickedness in high places praise be to God There Are Spiritual wickedness that rules in higher places and that's why Apostle Paul is reminding us that we are not wrestling against blood and flesh every time when we are fighting battles we should look Beyond blood and flesh amen praise be to God in the message uh in the message future home of the heaven bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother Bram says that all the sin that is in heaven above he is the prins of the power of the air he keeps off WS amen he keeps off WS off and the blessings from God who the princess amen the prince of the power of the air blessed be the name of the Lord he keeps the blessings he keeps off the blessings from God praise be to God and he says in there comes Thunderbolt of lightning and Strikes the Earth and everything from Heaven of uh of of silencing rain and typon and storms and everything comes from above which is Satan the prince of the power of the air blessed be the name of the Lord are you seeing the forces we are fighting against butam shows us the source of all these tornado the typhoons and all the lightning blessed be the name of the Lord and it says that the devil can keep off our blessings praise be to God so I'm here to remind you that we are fighting spiritual warfare and are fighting in prayer amen not saying prayer but I mean serious prayer blessed be the name of the Lord amen for the Bible tells us that our anniversary the devil is moving like a hungry lion looking for somebody to devour so how old do we to be on our knees blessed be the name of the Lord amen so we rest against blood and flesh even as you are coming the devil has been speaking to you that you feel that you are weak don't you feel that you are tired no you can swim even you can just swim blessed be the name of the Lord but anyhow inside your heart there is something that was telling you that you must go to church and that's why you came and sometime we come in the service then the Devil comes and robes us again praise be to God because when you insisted Satan he has also come at least he will make you dose he he will make you feel out of the place blessed be the name of the Lord but I want to tell you brother sister that we have come to fight spiritual warfare and thanks be to God that God is in our midst amen that the captain is on our side blessed be the name of the Lord so each time we come in the service we come to make W praise be to God we don't just come to sit amen we come to make war with the devil and the devil knows that praise be to God Amen the devil was cast from heaven and then he came on Earth in the message in the message uh that day on Calvary the prophet said that when the devil was cast on Earth he paralyzed the Earth praise be to God the Earth was paralyzed blessed be the name of the Lord and where we read in Revelation chapter 12 say that W to the inhabitant of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you praise be to God Amen God is sympathizing with the inhabitant of the earth and say that woe unto us for the day devil amen for the devil has come down unto you praise be to God Amen but don't be scared because Jesus knew that very well and Jesus wanted to prove to the devil that he's not his March praise be to God when the devil was cast here we are seeing say unto those who dwell in Earth because the devil is cast down here amen and when the devil came on Earth he thought after all what I've left heaven but even here I can make my kingdom and it's true the devil is the ruler of the world praise be to God Amen but God shows this very Earth also praise be to God and God knew very well that we are more than Overcomers and that's why he plac us on Earth amen he plac us on Earth to be tried to be tempted to fight amen that by the end of it all we are going to be called Overcomers praise be to God Amen God had right to destroy the Devil because God knew very well that inside us amen we have a DNA of our our father and he knows that by all means we will have to overcome the devil praise be to God and we are here tonight to tell the devil that we are not your March the devil is not our March amen praise be to God we are more than Overcomer we are the children of the most high God and God fights our battles amen and when we kneel in prayer brother sister that's where chains will break praise be to God Amen wherefore take you the whole armor of God not the quarter Armor of God we are taking the whole armor of God that's why when we are eating the word we eat the whole word we don't take quarter word amen we follow the right prescription praise be to God Amen he says wherefore take unto the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil Day praise be to God if we take the whole armor of God church we are going to be able to withstand this evil day but if we take the half Armor of God we are not going to be able the Pentecostal have taken the quarter armor and that's why the devil has stripped them naked the religion the Catholics they have taken the atom I think just a little adult armor that's why they go they study for seven good years to become a priest then when they come in the service they end up baptizing babies seven years in the monastery and then you come and do the opposite but the scripture says let us take the whole armor of God praise be to God that we be able to withand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand there for having your Landes got about with truth blessed be the name of the Lord even message believers who take quarter armor they the one who runs with false doctrines with polygamist but the Bible tells us to take the whole armor of God because without the whole armor of God you cannot be able to withstand this evil day we are living the perious time amen where is only the S is in the word praise be to God that's why the holy spirit says we should take the whole armor of God to be able to Wi this stand praise the Lord so my brother my sister I also advise you to take the whole armor of God praise the Lord bam tells us the devil does not fear our shouting the devil knows very well that the armor of the Christian is the word of God just this afternoon one brother was showing me a clip where one of the pastor was praying the congregation and I was I was telling that maybe they realized that because this man was he was moving the congregations praying one by one why not even a quarter there is nowhere in scriptures where the Bible says you spray Believers amen it is the work of the Holy Ghost to spread the church with the word amen not going and buying you over what and you start praying people but because the Bible say because they rejected the truth that's why God has given them to that spirit to accept lie and perish with it praise be to God and it's going to continue like that we get worse and worse and worse because we are living in the Harvest Time praise be to God the life is back in the seed praise the Lord and every time we come in the presence of God like this we have come in the presence of the son to be ripened by the word and we get rened by through prayer and eating on the word praise be to God Amen stand there having your land G apart with truth and having on your breastplate of righteousness and your feet shed with preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith without faith it is impossible to please God so you must take the bu of Faith you have come here believing that all whatever you have come to ask for it is going to be answered amen when I came here this afternoon I prayed and believed God that my wife is going to deliver and thanks be to God just shortly after that prayer and your prayers I was told as I was not even there praise be to God but God has been faithful there is a a sister Wanga is helping her don't say that hey brother now you're here preaching and she's there alone no praise the Lord but I have to come and stand in the father's business because when Jesus had as Lazarus had died he moved for another more days because he was in the will of the father and because I was in the will of the Father God did his part amen praise be to God so without faith it's impossible to please God Brethren if there's a time that we have to pray now is the time there is a lot of forces fighting against the church fighting against families amen so now is the time for us to arise and stand it's our time to pray it's our time to seek the Holy Ghost amen it's our time to be desperate you better be desperate now or you will never be desperate praise be to God you cannot fight unless you are desperate the country cannot fight unless they are desperate for Liberation praise be to God the children of Israel they had to pray until one day God met Moses and told him I am heard the Cry of my children they had cried for so long every single day the more they were oper oppressed the more they became desperate for deliverance praise be to God remember sometime we talk about the soul travail the bible say that when Zion travailed then she gave birth amen there must be a travail for a baby to be born there must be a desperation for a Believer to be serious you must be desperate for God [Applause] Amen and Bam says that if you're not worthy to die you are not worthy to live so if you think brother sister you better get desperate now because it's later than we think amen but what I'm saying the message honestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saint it says that what you need is an oldfashioned upper room with a prayer meeting where you breay down the power of God amen that is what we need tonight we need old fashioned upper room with a prayer meeting where you pray down the power of God not saying prayer you're going to sleep Hallelujah it may all in fact not only at night but we have to be we have to pray up there is what they call prayer walk sometime you you are walking from here to start praying amen you are going to Cha you are going to track to Cha Brother start praying praise be to God because it is later than we think Daniel tells us that when he saw that the 70 years was getting closer he went in prayer and fasting and supplication praise be to God we are expecting for the rapture we are waiting for the Rapture amen and our pastor told the Rapture started many years it started a long time ago amen we are in Rapture process are you in that process do you feel rupture praise the Lord sometime you walk you feel like is just over you praise be to God that is a sign of progress that you are Rapture material but even but if even just amening the word is a problem then there is something wrong you need to get desperate amen I'm here to remind you that this is spiritual warfare PR that we are fighting it's not just coming to church and sit no sir amen we must be charged up we must be we must be prayed up we must be desperate to the word praise be to God brother bam says we need that oldfashioned prayer meeting since other part says that we need that old fashion prayer meeting all night praise be to God and the good thing you have to pray for yourself because since the time of John the bapt until today the Bible says that the kingdom of God suffer violence it it's only violent that take it by force you must have a rugged Faith to take it you must be a violent believer amen you must go and look the devil in his eyes and tell him this is mine we are moving for for amen when the devil come and places his arm in in front of us we don't look for shortcut we say this is where we have passing praise be to God Amen you know it say that in the eye of the storm that's where the eagle passes praise be to God when you see when the eagle sees the storm coming maybe like tornado coming praise the Lord all those typhoon that devil will Target where that ey of the storm is and will go where the storm is coming from praise be to God and the prophet tells us that we are the eaget and Jesus is the mother Eagle God is the mother Eagle amen so my brother my sister in the eye of the storm we are not supposed to retweet that's where you have to go blessed be the name of the Lord so we have come for spiritual warfare we must be we must fight the Bible tells us here that we should have above all taking the shield of Faith where you shall be able to quench all the F deaths DS of the wicked and take the element of Salvation And The Sword of the spirit which is the word amen The Shield which is Faith and the sword which is the word amen when we go in prayer we approach the Devil with a shield of faith in the sword of the word it is written This one belongs to me it is written amen that devil give way this is mine praise be to God and I'm tells us that we have to fight for every inch of our promise indeed it is given to us and real in the works of children of Israel some other parts the journey was was flowing it was okay but in some areas it was serious fighting blessed be the name of the Lord there are some tribe that say that we shall not let them go we are going to oppose them and that's what happens even in the spiritual blessed be the name of the Lord but we are more than Overcomers Jesus gives us Victory whatever you ask the father in my name I will do it that the father may be glorified into the son amen whatever we ask in the name praise be to God that is the Revelation which David had the so they were just fighting the battle but there came a young man in the camp who are the Revelation in the name praise be to God and when he faces Goliath he told him I have come in the name of the Lord praise be to God David had a secret in the name and we approach the devil in the name not in the name of katas him not in the name of the mother church not in the name of the Holy Mary but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the devil will have to give way praise be to God but what I'm saying that when the name of Jesus was first mentioned a dead baby in the womb jumped amen hallelujah and we here to tell the devil that we have come tonight to face you in the name of the Lord Jesus every situation every condition every wickedness will have to give way in the name of Jesus do you believe that amen and that's why the prophet says with a prayer meeting where you pray down the power of God do you know that you can pray down the power of God and that's why we are here we have come to call on the power of God in 2 Corinthians chapter 10: 6 says then having in Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience amen praise be to God there is something in prayer I was reading about about Revival and realized that the entire theme of Revival comes through prayer without prayer there's no Revival however much we have the word it is Revival that brings the dynamic amen it is the spirit that Quicken and the spirit comes through prayer Jesus told them go wait in the upper room until the day of the Pentecost amen and the Bible says they were waiting in prayer praise be to God brother sister the disciple waited in prayer amen amen they were not gambling they are not figting there they were waiting in prayer and the Holy Ghost came down because there are some men who were praying and waiting blessed be the name of the Lord and what kind of prayer are they making in the upper room they had a big challenge because their Master had been taken away from them Jesus had left to heaven [Applause] amen and they were there they had never even heard about the Holy Ghost they heard it from Jesus that if I don't go the comat will not come what were they wrestling with they're pulling down all the stronghold imaginations amen that devil was speaking to them he will not come ahh it's impossible have you ever seen that even in the scroll and indeed there's nowhere in the scroll praise be to God so they had to fight against that thoughts and ideas say it is written he said it must come to pass [Applause] amen many time the Devil comes and try to convince us that what let it start with you tell the devil okay if I've never seen it well and good but it's starting with me today taking the shield of Faith amen Faith knows no Hance Faith knows no wall but what I'm saying that faith has been hair on his chest and when he speaks and every demon will silence amen when Fai speaks When Faith shouts it's like the sound of the lion when the lion roars the whole jungle will be silent because the King has roared and only the lion is that will be enjoying amen when Jesus speaks every stuation will have to be silenced it's only the bride that will rejoice amen surely the Lord God has spoken who shall not but prophesy amen the lion has throw who shall not fear praise be to God it's only the bride amen who knows the Roaring of the Lion what it means blessed be the name of the Lord amen Daniel says that when when Gabriel met Daniel he said the day you went in prayer and fasting that very day his prayer was answered but what happened this is what happened the prce is he talks of the principalities flesh and blood but against the principalities against the powers against the rulers of Darkness the rulers of Darkness captured gab and in prison Angel gab in prison brother talk of the force that can capture the entire angel Daniel never gave up he insisted he persisted amen why because the aner hold when Daniel was praying he realized his faith has gotten hold of something Yonder amen the answer was not coming but the man of God was not giving up why because the anchor hold though the Sheep is battered by the aner hold amen and when we continue in prayer guess what hallelujah praise be to God when the man was praying God called for another Emer meeting they called Search and Destroy Mission praise be to God Amen I believe when Gabriel was in prison and Michael saw it he saw him in prison oh glory be to God he said you wait I'm coming amen maybe he was there and then the call he received a call say hi while I'm coming blessed be the name of the Lord the devil thought that he had sure win but he didn't know what God was planning the Devil comes and shame you with sickness and he thinks you are done but doesn't know what God is having for you he said in Jeremiah I know the thought that I have toward you amen a thought of peace to bring to unexpected End Amen so when the angel was in prison I believe Michael did not just come silently that's not our God Amen if you want me to prove that by scriptures the Bible says that when the Israel when they wanted to see him do you know what happened
