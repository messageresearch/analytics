Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We are so happy to be here today. I remember it was about two years ago when I first came. I used to hear about ever since I was young. But when I came here, I fell in love with the people. And I remember I was standing with pastor uh pastor Peter Al. And pastor I promise you that will not be the last time but we will keep coming to he and the other pastors. So he and the other pastors questioned me that if the Lord makes a way that if it is possible we keep coming but that also we bring good ministers of the message. So I am simply here to fulfill that commitment. How many here believe in the in the Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. How [snorts] many here we are baptized in much water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? All right. Amen. We are believers. How many here believe that God has sent us a prophet with a message of restoration. Amen. Amen. And because of this, we have come here &gt;&gt; not just walking aimlessly. But because we are believers of this message whenever we are with brother Guma. He tells us of how God used our precious brother John Mark. And and when the Lord called him, God has raised an army of ministers that uh that have stood with this message. And they have continued to preach it. uh printing this message. Uh printing this message. How many appreciate reading the message of the hour? Okay. If you don't get those books and uh brother Michael Ray was here from Canada by the way he has sent you greetings and uh they're helping us to work on the Bible. And uh this Bible is going to have the Old Testament, the very first one, the good one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So and and very soon it will be printed and brought You say brother Michael received that burden to do that for when he came. Okay. So, how many here have a Bible? Put up your Bible. So you see many don't have Bibles but very soon everyone will have a Bible. Friends, &gt;&gt; we are not coming here to Karamoja because we have a special doctrine. We are coming here just five minutes. We are coming here because we believe the same message which you believe. And we are coming here to stand behind a ministry. And we appreciate all the pastors, the men of God. And the only reason why we are coming here, we are not coming. We are not coming to cause division. We are coming to hold their hands, the ministers, PASTORS, so that listen so that together we can be able to edify the body OF CHRIST IN CANADA. Now before I sit down, listen carefully. It's not easy to come here. That's why there are many who had never come. No one can only come here because they are burdened for you. Because because remember the bride is not going in the rapture until she's perfected. Believing is one thing, but the church must go on unto perfection. And the only thing going to do that is the message, THE WORD. [screaming] SO what we need is the word. Tell your neighbor we need the word. And we need God to send us men of the word. Not another MESSAGE but the same MESSAGE WHICH BROTHER BHAM PREACHED. THE SAME MESSAGE which brother John Mark introduced in this in this region. THE SAME MESSAGE WHICH THE pastors have been preaching to you in your local church. SO WHEN YOU COME TO A CONFESSION LIKE THIS, put all your MIND on hearing the word. HAVE A DESIRE. HAVE THE HUNGER. HAVE THE APPETITE. HOW MANY are hungry to hear the word? Now I have good news for you this morning, this afternoon. Hallelujah. Listen. Hallelujah. And the good news are God has sent us another man of the word. Listen, the minister going to speak to you this morning, this afternoon was supposed to be preaching in convention. There are many other places he's invited to go. He's very busy. He's not from near all the way from a place called New York, USA. It took him It took him two three days to arrive in Enlight. And when he arrived, his luggage was lost. Several times the devil was trying to hinder him from arriving here. There must be something THAT YOU THAT GOD KNOWS THAT YOU need and the devil was trying to hinder it. There is something that God blessed in this ministry that the Lord knew you will need today. And in this convention and uh quite frankly I can tell you this. I met Pastor Simon in Zimbabwe. He was preaching for and I heard him preach and I was blessed beyond measure. Which food do you like eating here? What is it? The food. What is the name of the food? What's the name of the food in Kamoja? &gt;&gt; Angadish. &gt;&gt; Angadish. &gt;&gt; Angadish. &gt;&gt; Angish. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Angish. &gt;&gt; Angadish. &gt;&gt; If you have if you have ever eaten angish very tasty in the mouth, you want to eat more. THAT IS HOW I WAS FEELING WHEN he was preaching. So when the pastors ASKED ME TO INVITE someone to come, they told me pastor you come and preach but if you have someone also bring them but I said even if I don't preach I know someone who will serve us angish &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so why AM I SAYING THAT? I WANT YOU to have an expectation. I know you love the Lord. Otherwise, you could not sit under this sun. So I say God is going to bless you. God is going to speak to you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So his name is Pastor Simon Peterson say from New York, USA. York, USA. &gt;&gt; And you know, one time one man said, "To whom shall we go that has the words of eternal life? They came to JESUS because of fish. They came TO JESUS BECAUSE OF BREAD. THEY CAME TO Jesus because he was healing them and doing things. BUT WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT THE WORD, they left. They walked away. Why? because they did not have the hunger for the word. But Simon Peter said, "AND I HOPE THERE IS SOMEONE HERE who is like Simon Peter." HE SAID, JESUS SAID, "DO YOU ALSO WANT TO GO?" He said, "TO WHOM SHALL WE GO? WHO HAS THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. So the people were hungry. Simon Peter was hungry for THE WORD. AND THIS AFTERNOON, God has sent us another Simon Peter. And he will give us nothing but the word which he had already. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAN we say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, can I usher in Pastor Simon, if you can please come, let us believe the Lord is going to speak to us this morning. Let's put our hands together for the man of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Like to greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is it is an honor for me to be here. It was very difficult for me to come. I want to say one thing to you really have a burden and love for you people. We met in Zimbabwe. As he said, I did not know that God had a plan for me to be here. We talk about the mission work over there. When I went back, we stay connected. I almost did not come, &gt;&gt; but uh God wanted me to be here. Brother came to him in I was I was sleeping because of time difference. It was 200 a.m. in the morning. The the phone rang. I I don't shut my phone off. I I picked the phone. I heard then behold it was him. He said, "I have a brother here. I want to greet you and speak to you. So he put brother um John Mark and brother John Mark spoke to me about the meetings we spoke and that changed everything finally. I I I told my wife and she said she said I think you should go. So and by the grace of God we are here. May God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless the ministers. If if you are here today is it is because of their labors and may God bless all of you servants of God. The reason why we are here is because God sent a prophet is this message of the hour that has gathered us together. The United Nations. They have tried to bring nations together but they have never succeeded. What they failed to do this message have succeeded to do When I go anywhere, I meet believers. When you don't know them, you meet them for the first time. You feel at home. No suspicion. We are one body. We are the children of God. We [snorts] came from God. WE ARE GOING BACK TO GOD. BLESSED be the name of the Lord. It doesn't matter where YOU ARE. It doesn't matter what you have. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT you don't have. Praise the NAME OF THE LORD. THERE'S SOMETHING in you THAT IS GREATER THAN ALL THE RICHES OF THE WORLD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I believe that is why the message came to this region. We are here because of the message of the hour. May the name of the Lord be praised. We we have no agenda but to bring to preach Christ said this message is Christ. So I trust that I will say something that will be of a help to us. God bless you. Let us stand to our feet as we read. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Heaven Father, We thank you for this wonderful opportunity you've given unto us to come among your children. We humbly ask that you help us. Give us grace to see something that will help your people. We don't want to come to the place where we feel we know it all because there is always a more of you. Open our understanding. Bind every spirit that is contrary to the spirit of God. We spell it in the name of Jesus Christ. We take authority over every foul devil, many powers that is ruling in this environment in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. MAY the pillar of fire move among us Lord. THE angel of the Lord minister to every need. HEAL the sick Lord baptize with the Holy Ghost. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles with you, &gt;&gt; I would like to read from Genesis 15 verse 13. Genesis 15:13, the Bible says, "And he said unto Abraham, No opportunity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them 400 years. And also that nation serve will I judge, and afterward they shall come out with great substance. Thank Scripture Revelation 18 verse4 and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of our sin that you receive not our Please. Amen. Amen. God bless the reading of his word. You can please take your seat. I want to speak to you this afternoon. And the message I entitled the calling out of God's people. Amen. God made a covenant with Abraham. God gave a promise. This promise was not only to Abraham, but God extended that promise to his seed. God knows the future. He told his friend Abraham, "Your seed will be in a strange land. THEY WILL BE THERE FOR 400 YEARS. And at THE END OF THE 400 years, God said, I God will bring them out. Amen. Amen. When the hour came, God remembered his promise. Amen. Amen. God raised a prophet by the name of Moses who was born born in a peculiar way. God allowed the enemy to even raise Moses up. Amen. AMEN. WHEN THE HOUR OF deliverance came, GOD APPEARED to the prophet Moses. God in this Bible when whenever he wants to speak, he chooses a prophet. HE SAID, "I GOD will do nothing EXCEPT I REVEAL MY secret to my servant the prophet." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God was about to destroy THIS WORLD, GOD REVEALED THAT SECRET TO NOAH. When God was about to to h to bring Israel out of Egypt, GOD REVEALED THAT SECRET TO MOSES. If you want to know the secret of God, you must come to a prophet. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO SERVE God in every generation, you must come to a prophet. CAN WE SAY AMEN? JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS A PROPHET. PROPHETS ARE NOT TAUGHT by men. PROPHETS ARE TAUGHT by God himself. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT if you want to serve God correctly in any generation. You must come to a a prophet. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FALSE PROPHETS. BUT A MAN SENT [screaming] FROM GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THAT PROPHET COMES, GOD WILL VINDICATE THAT THIS is my prophet. God said I am God and I CHANGE NOT. DO YOU KNOW THAT IN THE DAYS OF NOAH there were many preachers? THE BIBLE SAYS THAT NOAH WAS A PREACHER of righteousness. That means they were preachers of unrighteousness. Hallelujah. AMEN. THAT IS WHY WE CAN READ ABOUT the Elijah, THE JEREMIAH, the Isaiah. GOD WILL SEND THIS MAN at different generations TO REVEAL HIS PLAN OF REDEMPTION FOR THAT GENERATION. WAY [screaming] THAT YOU CAN ESCAPE THE JUDGMENT OF GOD. So come to that prophet. Can we say amen? Amen. AMEN. THOSE WHO ESCAPED THE JUDGMENT DURING THE DAYS OF NOAH WERE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE OF LAW. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. A PROPHET HAS THE MIND OF GOD. WE NEVER KNEW HOW TO WORSHIP GOD. BUT GOD SENT US A PROPHET. TO SHOW US how to approach God. THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, they went to Egypt. EGYPT IS LIKE the world. They were there in Egypt. Egypt was a PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF IDOLS PEOPLE WERE WORSHIPING THE GOD OF THE NILE many many different gods. Praise the Lord. GOD SENT A PROPHET with the word of the Lord AND GOD FOR HIM TO PROVE THAT HE'S GOD OVER ALL [screaming] THE GODS FOR ALL OTHER GODS ARE IDOLS. GOD BROUGHT JUDGMENT OVER THE GOD OF THE NILE. TURN THE water into blood. Praise the NAME OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS GOD DOING? God was SHOWING THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF MOSES that is a living God. MOSES DID SIGNS AND WONDERS. TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF GOD'S PEOPLE. HALLELUJAH. God is now going to bring them out of Egypt to take them to a place WHERE THEY WILL WORSHIP GOD. Can we say amen? WE WERE CHILDREN OF GOD. WE WERE IN DIFFERENT areas worshiping IDOLS WORSHIPING THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS. FOR GOD'S [screaming] GRACE CAME DOWN TO EARTH. GOD SENT A PROPHET. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND ONE OF YOUR SONS GOT A HOLD OF THIS MESSAGE AND BROUGHT IT TO THIS REGION. WHY? BECAUSE YOU WERE HERE. The message came because of you. AMEN. PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AND THIS message brought [screaming] US out of our tribes, our idols. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. And he brought us to worship God. THIS MESSAGE HAS COME TO SHOW US HOW TO WORSHIP GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SO WE SEE THAT MOSES BROUGHT THE PEOPLE OUT AND LED THEM OUT OF EGYPT. WHEN HE WENT TO PHARAOH, GOD TOLD HIM, "WHEN YOU GO TO PHARAOH, tell Pharaoh that thus say the Lord, let my people go SO THAT THEY CAN WORSHIP ME." CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD WANTED HIS PEOPLE TO WORSHIP HIM. WE ARE NOT HERE TO WORSHIP WILLIAM BRHAM [screaming] BROUGHT US TO JESUS CHRIST. The prophet OF GOD CAME TO SHOW US HOW TO WORSHIP GOD. Praise the name of the Lord. God never wanted them to be in Egypt. GOD NEVER WANTED THE INFLUENCE OF EGYPT. GOD NEVER WANTED THEM to copy the denominations. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. HE BROUGHT THEM [screaming] OUT SO THAT THEY CAN WORSHIP HIM ACCORDING TO THE WAY HE WANT THEM TO BE. WE WANT HIM TO BE WORSHIPED. PRAY THE NAME OF THE LORD. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN GOD SENDS A PROPHET. HE COME TO SHOW [screaming] YOU HOW TO WORSHIP THE TRUE AND LIVING GOD. A prophet ALWAYS COME TO MAKE GOD KNOWN to the people. IN THE ABSENCE OF A PROPHET, he will start worshiping idols. Amen. After the fall, after the fall, when man became blind spiritually, a man will look at the tree and say, "This look like God." They make an idol out of a tree. They make idol out of a stone. Can we say amen? AMEN. SO THAT IS WHY [screaming] GOD WAS TELLING THEM. THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GOD BESIDES ME. Praise the Lord. these people, Israel under Moses ministry, THEY BEGAN TO WORSHIP GOD. BUT AS TIME WENT BY, they begin to bring THE IDEAS OF EGYPT. ARE WE TOGETHER? YES. They began to do things. THEY WANTED TO BE LIKE THE OTHER NATIONS. They wanted TO BE LIKE THE OTHER CHURCHES. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER, &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT TO BE LIKE THE DENOMINATIONS. THERE &gt;&gt; IS A REASON WHY WE CALL OURSEL MESSAGE BELIEVERS. THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR [screaming] HAS COME TO SHOW US how to worship. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. WHEN MOSES BROUGHT THEM OUT OF EGYPT, GOD EVEN SHOWED MOSES HOW THE WOMEN and men should dress. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY CANNOT DRESS LIKE THE EGYPTIANS. GOD REVEALED TO MOSES. AMEN. AMEN. the honor of the priesthood. IF YOU WANT TO BE A PRIEST, YOU HAVE TO BE BORN OUT OF A CERTAIN LINEAGE. CAN WE SAY AMEN? GOD SHOW THEM THE SACRIFICES THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE. GOD [screaming] SHOW MOSES. ARE YOU WITH ME? GOD SHOWED PROPHET MOSES HOW TO BUILD THE TABERNACLE. God showed [screaming] Moses, how the priest MUST REST. GOD SHOWED MOSES WHEN THE PRIEST ENTER INTO THE TABERNACLE, THERE'S A WAY THE PRIEST MUST WALK. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. BECAUSE MOSES &gt;&gt; WAS [screaming] A PROPHET THAT CAME AND BROUGHT THE MIND OF God to the people. AMEN. IN ORDER FOR YOU TO WORSHIP GOD CORRECTLY, you have to come to Moses. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. ANY WORSHIP OUTSIDE [screaming] OF WHAT MOSES SAID is not of God. [screaming] ANY SACRIFICE that anybody BRING OUTSIDE OF THE ORDER OF MOSES, GOD WILL NOT ACCEPT IT. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT IS ONLY A PROPHET &gt;&gt; THAT [screaming] SHOWS YOU HOW TO WORSHIP GOD. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER THE SACRIFICES THAT WE TRY TO PRESENT TO GOD, IF IT IS CONTRARY TO THE [screaming] WORD OF THE LORD, GOD WILL NEVER RECEIVE IT. TOGETHER. Say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, they were saying to Jesus, &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE IN MOSES AND WE ARE CHILDREN OF MOSES. MOSES SAID THIS. MOSES SAID THAT JESUS LOOK AT THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE LEFT FROM THE ORDER OF MOSES. He said, "Let me tell you, my friends, in vain you worship God, because you are teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Are we together?" One day, Jesus went to the temple. Why did he meet in the church? They've made shops in the house of Yeah. There was a Baptist market, a Pentecostal market. METHODISTS HAVE THEIR OWN MARKET. OH, COME TO OUR DENOMINATION. WE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY OF SALVATION. THE BAPTIST SAY, "COME TO OUR CHURCH. WE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY OF GOD FOR WHAT THEY NEVER KNEW. THEY WERE SELLING LAMBS." CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; JESUS, LOOK AT THE WAY THEY WERE WORSHIPING. HE LOOK AT THE LAW OF MOSES. HE KNEW THAT THEY HAVE DEVIATED FROM THE WORSHIP OF GOD. HE SAID YOUR WORSHIP IS REJECTED. If you have an UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MOSES WAS PREACHING, YOU WILL COME [screaming] TO THE REALIZATION THAT I AM THE LAMB OF GOD. CAN I SAY AMEN? AMEN. WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR EYES off of the message, YOU WILL PRODUCE A FALSE WORSHIP THAT GOD WILL REJECT AT THE END. ARE WE TOGETHER? THAT IS WHY [screaming] FOR YOU AND ME WILL MAKE IT TO this generation. Come to the message of the hour. [screaming] READ THE MESSAGE. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? IF I SAY SOMETHING, &gt;&gt; THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU KNOW IS THE TRUTH. IS WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID, TODAY WE ARE MADE IDOLS OF MEN. ALL THESE BIG PREACHERS FROM AMERICA. ALL THIS ONE FROM AUSTRALIA. THERE'S only one prophet. CAN WE SAY AMEN? HE IS THE ONE. [screaming] WE MUST LISTEN TO AMEN. MAY GOD HELP US. JESUS CHRIST. REJECTED THEIR WORSHIP. John the Baptist, his daddy was a priest. He was a theologian. John John's uh ministry was so important. God never allow John to go to his daddy's Bible school. At the age of nine, God sent him to the wilderness. Can we say amen? Amen. When John CAME ON THE SCENE, LOOK AT HIS PREACHING. when was in the wilderness saw how tricky the serpents are. He look at the RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. HE SAY YOU ARE GENERATION OF VIPERS. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO BIBLE SCHOOL. to get the Holy Ghost. CAN WE SAY AMEN TO TEACH YOU the word? YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. CAN I SAY AMEN? GOD IS NOT A RESPECTCTOR OF PERSONS. GOD IS INTERESTED IN HIS WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY? &gt;&gt; There were many things they have changed in the message of if you go to the original message of Moses. Moses told them when you want to bring a sacrifice Go and take the lamb, a lamb, an animal from your own fold. Are we together? Because this animal that you are taking care of there is a connection. SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE BRINGING THE ANIMAL, YOU ARE BRINGING IT TO GOD WITH FEELING. Are we together? But as time progress, the people, the ministers begin to change things here and there and here. They said we will make it easy for the people because God has blessed them with money. You don't need to go to your farm anymore. Just come in our shop, pay money. You see the gospel must not be about money BUSINESS right for money. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF GOD CALLS YOU, HE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE MUST STAND FOR THE WORD OF GOD SO THAT WE CAN HELP OUR [screaming] PEOPLE. It became a money-m business. AND ANYBODY THAT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE, THEY WILL COME AND BUY YOU WITH THEIR DOCTRINE. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. THEY BEGIN TO TEACH things that was CONTRARY TO WHAT MOSES taught them. They became blind. They became very blind. There is nothing you could tell them. BECAUSE THAT SPIRIT HAS BLINDING THEM. THEY CRUCIFY THE VERY MESSIAH THAT THEY WERE SINGING ABOUT IN THE IN IN IN THE TEMPLE. David under inspiration. HE WAS WRITING A SONG. MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME? CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THEY WERE SINGING THOSE SONGS. [screaming] JOHN THE BAPTIST SAID, "BEHOLD [screaming] THE LAMB OF GOD." JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS a prophet. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; IS ONLY A PROPHET THAT IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MESSIAH FOR YOUR DAY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Prophets are born different. PROPHETS ARE DESIGNED DIFFERENT. THEY HAVE [screaming] THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO HEAR FROM GOD. In a way that none of us have. Maybe in the next service I I will go deeper into that if God will lead me that way. When God was speaking when God was speaking to Moses, the people were under the mountain. They were down the mountain. The church AS GOD WAS SPEAKING, "THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY. THOU SHALT NOT LIE. [screaming] CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE DOWN THERE, ALL [screaming] THEY WERE HEARING WAS THUNDER AND LIGHTNINGS. THE VOICE OF GOD [screaming] IS THE VOICE OF A THUNDER. CAN WE SAY AMEN? [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. A PROPHET IS DESIGNED TO ENTER INTO THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND [screaming] HEAR THE ORIGINAL VOICE OF GOD. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? [screaming] HE COMES DOWN TO THE PEOPLE AND HE BEGIN TO INTERPRET WHAT GOD WAS SAYING. AMEN. Don't take this prophet like any of this evangelist. Don't take William Brham like this other evangelist is a prophet sent to this generation. You see God's ways are past [music] finding out. God's ways is difficult to understand. When they went to Egypt, you know, Joseph went there. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Jacob was in Palestine. When they were going to Egypt, they never cross a sea. That mean there was another route to go to Egypt. But God wanted to prove his GOD [screaming] CAME DOWN and he began to lead the prophet. DON'T DOUBT A PROPHET. DON'T QUESTION [screaming] A PROPHET. CAN WE SAY AMEN? [screaming] &gt;&gt; DON'T QUESTION THIS MESSAGE. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS, DON'T PUT YOUR IDEAS INTO IT. Don't put your opinion to it. ARE YOU HEARING ME? BECAUSE GOD [screaming] WILL TEACH US GOD GOD WILL REQUIRE THE BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE FROM OUR HANDS. WE BETTER BE SURE [screaming] THAT WHAT WE ARE PREACHING AND WE ARE TELLING THE PEOPLE IS WHAT THE PROPHET HALLELUJAH HAS SPOKEN IN THIS GENERATION. Blessed be the name of the Lord. We are people that were called out. Now God told Abraham, &gt;&gt; God also told Moses, &gt;&gt; when you go to Pharaoh, Pharaoh have held the people in bondage. So are we together? PHARAOH HAD MADE SLAVE OUT OF THEM. make he made them slaves. They were too much busy improving the economy of Egypt, no time to pray, no time for church, no time for worship. Their businesses became more important. GOD NEVER WANTED HIS PEOPLE TO be in bondage. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET YOUR CATTLE BUSINESS STOP YOU FROM COMING TO CHURCH. SEEKING FIRST THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHEN YOU PUT GOD FIRST IN YOUR LIFE, GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. ARE WE TOGETHER? MAY THE NAME OF THE Lord be praised. So, you know, Moses even showed them how to marry. Yes. You see those unbelievers Don't go and pick a woman from there. God said, Moses told them, if you do that, if they if you marry from a woman that is an idol worship, who is not a believer, He will turn your heart. Are we together? Wasn't that what Ahab did? AHAB [screaming] NEGLECTED INSTRUCTION OF MOSES. He neglected THE INSTRUCTIONS OF MOSES. HE WENT AND HE MARRIED JEZEBEL. CAN WE SAY AMEN CONTRARY TO WHAT MOSES SAID? HE BROUGHT IDOLATRY IN IN IN IN THE CHURCH. ARE WE TOGETHER? I'M SAYING THIS TO SHOW YOU [screaming] THE IMPORTANCE of a God send prophet. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WE NEED TO DROP OUR OWN IDEAS AND GO INTO THE MESSAGE. TRANSLATOR. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO DROP OUR ideas and check the message. Check the Bible. Brother, HIS MESSAGE BROUGHT US BACK to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. IF WE FAIL TO FOLLOW THE PROPHET CORRECTLY, all our effort will be in vain. When Moses left the church just for a short period to go up to the mountain to receive the law of God. In the absence of the prophet, the people put pressure on the ministry TO TO BUILD a golden calf. Are we together? Let's be careful so we will not build golden calf around. ARE WE TOGETHER? WE ARE NOT POINTING THE PEOPLE TO OURSELVES. WE MUST POINT THEM TO JESUS CHRIST. CHRIST [screaming] IS YOUR SAVIOR. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming] &gt;&gt; CHRIST DIED FOR YOU. WHATEVER SAID, MY MINISTRY IS TO CONNECT YOU TO CHRIST. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. I'm not talking about the Pentecostal Christ. Pentecost have their own Jesus. METHODIST HAVE THEIR OWN JESUS. METHODIST HAVE THEIR OWN JESUS. THERE IS A WAY THEY BAPTIZE. THERE'S A WAY THEY TAKE THEIR COMMUNION. CAN WE SAY AMEN? THERE WAS A WAY THEY RUN THE CHURCH. William Brandham has come in this generation to show us how to worship God. Let me say this without fear, any preacher, any preacher in this generation that that try to the office of a prophet make themsel that equal with a prophet. They are false. THERE WAS NOBODY LIKE MOSES. CAN I SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO ONE LIKE MOSES. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO ONE LIKE WILLIAM BRANDON IN THIS GENERATION. ARE WE TOGETHER? HE KNOWS THE WAY. WILLIAM BRHAM KNOWS [screaming] THE WAY. WILLIAM BRHAM KNOWS THE WAY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW GOD, IF YOU REJECT, WILL EMBRACE for the effort of printing the books in your own language. Listen, it's it's very important said the people in the days of Paul, they knew the message the way Paul preached it. He said, "Oh, the believers in he said they are noble because whatever. They go back and check it whether it is so or not." &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. LET ME TELL YOU FRIENDS, THERE IS NOTHING HIGHER THAN THE WORD OF GOD, THERE'S NOTHING GREATER THAN THIS MESSAGE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. READ THE MESSAGE. LISTEN TO THE TEXT. GOD WILL REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU. When the first apostles came in the days of Paul, They begin to change things said it was not the pastors. It was not the pastors that challen those false preachers. It was the congregation because they were taught. THEY KNEW THE WORD OF GOD. THEY KNEW THE MESSAGE. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THEY LOOK THEM TO THE [screaming] EYE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU ARE BLACK OR WHITE. THEY SAY YOU ARE NOT SAYING WHAT PAUL SAY. THEREFORE, YOU ARE FALSE. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WE MUST KNOW WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS ALL ABOUT. [screaming] May God help us. I don't know when to close. Maybe I'll close in a moment and maybe when we come back later we say Paul was saying brethren I don't want you to be ignorant. Your fathers, they were all under the cloud. They passed through the sea. They were baptized unto Moses. He said they drunk from that rock. Let me tell you, don't be deceived. These people enjoy the signs and the wonders. WHEN GOD OPENED THE RED SEA, THEY SAW IT. THEY WALKED THROUGH. They went OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE. THEY SAW THEIR ENEMIES DYING. THEY SAW PHARAOH DEFEATED. CAN WE SAY AMEN? THEY WERE THERE IN EGYPT. WHEN THERE WAS DARKNESS IN EGYPT IN THERE WAS LIGHT, THEY ENJOYED THE BENEFIT OF THE EXODUS. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WHEN MOSES STRUCK THE ROCK, THEY DRANK FROM THE WATER. [screaming] THEY ATE THE MANA THAT CAME FROM HEAVEN. THEY WERE REJOICING OVER THE MANA. THEY WERE HAPPY. HALLELUJAH. OH, MOSES HAVE SENT US A PROPHET. OH, [screaming] I MEAN GOD HAVE SENT US MOSES. WE LOVE THE PROPHET. WE ARE THE BELIEVERS OF THE MESSAGE. But let's see what Paul says. THE BIBLE SAYS MANY OF them God not well pleased. They were overthrown in the wilderness. Why would God not be happy with the people for whom he killed Pharaoh and his army? Why will he not be pleased with the people to whom he gave mana from heaven? The Bible say he gave them angels. They were no more. They were no more in Egypt. They were message believers FOLLOWING THE MESSAGE ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF THE MESSAGE. Why was God not pleased with him? Because the reason God brought them out is for them to worship him. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? And what did God do? God opened the seals out of the law. brought the Lord to them so that by the word of God, they know how to come to church, the husbands will know how to treat their wives. Are we together? Husband, love your wives. Your wife is a daughter of God. Treat her like a slave. Are we together? WIVES BE OBEDIENT TO YOUR HUSBANDS. CHILDREN, OBEY YOUR PARENTS. WHEN THEY BELIEVE THE TEACHINGS OF MOSES, IT MAKE THEM A PECULIAR PEOPLE. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE REASON WHY YOU ARE DIFFERENT. CAN WE SAY AMEN? THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR TOLD YOU TO LOVE one another. THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS ABOVE TRY. Is above tribe. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? IF A MAN IS BORN AGAIN, God will DELIVER HIM FROM TRIBAL SPIRIT. ARE WE TOGETHER? WE DELIVER THEM FROM NATIONAL SPIRIT. ONE WILL COME FOR JESUS CHRIST. We are we are Amen. WE HAVE ONE NATIONAL SPIRIT. OUR NATIONAL SPIRIT IS THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAID the Holy Ghost will not BEHAVE IN ONE PERSON IN one brother. Misbehave in another brother. Can I say amen? IF YOU MISBEHAVE, YOU met a ghost. have a ghost but that is a devil ghost. CAN WE SAY AMEN? THE HOLY GHOST IS HOLY. CAN WE SAY AMEN? THE HOLY GHOST WILL MAKE YOU RESPECT YOUR ELDERS. That is why. When we come here, we have not come to try to make our bosses COME TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU ARE DOING. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; WHAT GOOD WILL it do us? &gt;&gt; I can't begin to condemn all these brothers and then Jesus. I'm gone. It's not wise. Praise the name of the Lord. May use me to help you. God might use you. God might use you to help me. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAID THERE'S NO BIG ONE AMONG US. THERE'S NO SMALL ONE AMONG US. JESUS CHRIST IS A GREATER PERSON. HALLELUJAH. HE SAID LITTLE CHILDREN LOVE ONE ANOTHER. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. BAM WAS THE MOST HUMBLE MAN IN YOUR GENERATION. Came to Africa. HALLELUJAH. HE NEVER TAKE HIMSELF ABOVE THE PEOPLE. MAY GOD GIVE US GRACE. May the Lord help us. This message we must know what it is. It's not just saying, "Oh yeah, I believe I go a prophet. The voice came to show you even how to run your church." YOU KNOW, BROTHER SHOWS US HOW to run the church IS THERE JUST LIKE MOSES. The order of worship, how how we should enter church, what we should do and what we should not do. Can we say amen? how we should preach. The qualification of a ministry change the word of God. God say I am God I change not. Are you with me church? May God help us. May God help us to understand the ministry of a prophet. If you know the message, I can't come here and deceive you because you know the message and that is why we encouraging you the message. Belove him today as I close this session I want you to see the importance of a prophet. Why God send Will? Why? What did he bring to us? Let me tell you something. When Moses went to Egypt, I'm closing here. When Moses went to Egypt, he did a sign. He did a wonder. This this thing that you are doing is a cheap magic. Pharaoh magicians could do the same things that Moses when he throw the stick and he turn to a serpent. He also did a miracle and brought serpents on the sea. In other words, Moses Pharaoh was said, "This thing that you come to do is not new. The men can do the same thing." But what was the difference? friends was the word God's desire to worship him. And if we are going to worship him, we have to worship him the way he want us to worship him. And the only way to find out is to go to the books of Moses. Praise the name of the Lord. There's an understanding that comes to you. When you are reading the books of the prophet, Amen. When the children of Israel were in bondage, they were to go to Babylon. When you go back from Babylon back home, Daniel &gt;&gt; was reading the books of the prophet. Daniel, &gt;&gt; he said, "As I was reading, I understood by books OF PROPHET JEREMIAH THAT IT IS TIME FOR US TO RETURN HOME." CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE HOUR, YOU MUST READ THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? &gt;&gt; 71 YEARS AGO, WILLIAM SAID ONE DAY A POPE WILL COME OUT OF THE UNITED STATES. HALLELUJAH. JUST FEW MONTHS AGO OR MAYBE ABOUT A YEAR NOW, IT WAS FULFILLED. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] THE END TIME IS HERE. THE RAPTURE IS COMING CLOSER. BUT IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE IN THE RAPTURE, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. NOT MY MESSAGE, BUT THE MESSAGE OF WILLIAM BRHAM. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME, CHURCH? MAY GOD HELP US. MAY GOD HELP US as preachers. MAY GOD HELP US AS FAMILIES. THIS MESSAGE THAT CAME. HE HAS COME. AMEN. CHANGE THE HEART OF WARRIORS. CAN WE SAY AMEN? HE GAVE YOU A CHRISTIAN HEART. WHEN THE MESSAGE COMING TO YOU, YOU LOVE YOUR ENEMIES. HALLELUJAH. WHEN CHRIST COME TO YOU, THE MESSAGE DELIVER FROM WITCHCRAFT. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? POWER OF TRANSFORMATION. MAY GOD HELP US. THERE IS NO POWER LIKE THIS MESSAGE. WILLIAM'S MESSAGE IS THE ONE and only message that will take you IN THE RAPTURE. MAY GOD BLESS YOU. May God give you grace. May God help us to have an understanding of what this message is all about. It's not another denomination. We are called out. God be with you. God bless you. Let's bow heads as I pray. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we thank you for your grace. We thank you for your mercy. We thank you for the love of God in the hearts of your children sitting under this son feeding upon the word of God. Thank you for these ministers whom you have used in the region to spread the message. I pray the grace of God upon each and every one of us including myself that you reveal yourself unto us. So that end of the day offering will not be rejected. &gt;&gt; Sacrifice Cain decorated his altar. He brought but he lack revelation. Lord give us revelation as pastors, as ministers, take away politic spirit from us. RELIGIOUS SPIRIT, RELIGIOUS SPIRIT, TAKE IT AWAY FROM US. OH JESUS, SET YOUR PEOPLE FREE. TAKE AWAY RELIGIOUS [screaming] DEVILS. TAKE AWAY DECEIVING SPIRITS. OPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WILL WALK IN THE LIGHT OF THE WORD. BLESS YOUR SERVANT. BLESS THE HOST PASTOR. BLESS JOHN MARK THE BURDEN YOU'VE GIVEN HIM OH GOD bless reward this man LORD AT THE END OF THE DAY AND WE WILL BE ACCEPTED WE WANT TO BE ACCEPTED LORD GRANT IT I pray the rest of the meetings and give us grace &gt;&gt; whatever we do we ask ourselves If Jesus was here, will he do what we are doing? If brother was here, will he do the things that we do? Will we talk to our wives the way we talk to our wife? If will he beat his wife? No. No. No. No. Give us THAT SAME SPIRIT. OH LORD, HELP THIS REGION. BLESS MY brother Lord. Use him in this region. As you place a B in his heart, oh God, GRANT HIM GRACE. LORD, THERE WILL BE A COOPERATION WITHIN THE MINISTRY AND ALL OF US WILL WORK TOGETHER TO HELP YOUR PEOPLE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, OUR HOMES WILL LEAVE EVERYTHING. WE LEAVE OUR JOBS.

MAY YOU OPEN MORE THEIR UNDERSTANDING. GIVE THEM MORE GRACE THERE LORD as I commit them to you in Jesus name I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us say amen. Amen. [screaming] Oh, that's very small. Amen, brother. That's very small. Amen. Tell them that's very small. Amen. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? Father was an Anglican priest and I I had this Bible but I was blind and I did not know. BUT THEN SOMEONE TOLD ME God sent a prophet. AND WHEN I STARTED READING THIS MESSAGE of this prophet, I started understanding my Bible. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THAT'S WHY we are so happy that God has sent us a message. Because now we know who we are. THIS IS A CALLING of God FOR US TO COME OUT and then come back to the word. How many appreciate what we have heard today? Amen. Amen. Amen. That's just a beginning. You know there is one thing that pastor say that really made me so so happy and I saw other pastors they are very excited. He said if uh you know when when God sent Paul with a message later he know of COURSE OTHER PREACHERS CAME other ministers came and then they listen to them. What they saw what they were saying was not exactly what Paul said. They called them false teachers. So the question is, do you know THE FALSE TEACHER AND A TRUE TEACHER. You can only KNOW IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT Paul said. BUT REMEMBER Paul was the FIRST CHURCH AGE MESSENGER. How many ages DO WE HAVE? SEVEN AGE. WE HAVE NO EIGHTH AGE. We only have seven ages. And how many messengers? Seven messengers. AND PAUL WAS THE FIRST ONE. And do you know the age we are living in? Ask your neighbor, do you know the age we are living in? Do you know that we are living in? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, I know. &gt;&gt; Do you know? &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; What did they say? Which age are we living in? Which age are we living in? What? What did she say? &gt;&gt; The seventh age. How do you say that in Amen? &gt;&gt; WE ARE IN THE SEVENTH AGE. LISTEN, THE SEVENTH AGE IS THE LAST AGE. AFTER THIS AGE, the rapture Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT GO IN A RAPTURE [screaming] &gt;&gt; unless if you are PREPARED in every AGE messenger with a message to prepare the bride. NOW THE MESSENGER IS NOT THE MESSAGE. THE MESSENGER IS NOT A MESSAGE BUT IN EVERY AGE THE message is Christ. NOW IN OUR LAST AGE GOD HAS SENT US A MESSENGER. HIS name is William Brham. THAT'S HIS MESSAGE. THAT'S HIS NAME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD GAVE HIM A MESSAGE. AND THIS MESSAGE IS TO CALL A BRIDE, OUT OF RELIGION, OUT OF THE SYSTEMS of man, out of uh you know some of you were warriors. ONE MAN CALLED JOHN MARKOUS WHEN HIS EYES WERE OPEN TO THIS PERSON. LISTEN WHERE HIS EYES WERE OPENED. He ran to this REGION HAVING A FIRE IN HIS HEART. EVERY SEED OF GOD HERE MUST COME OUT. And we are here. [screaming] God had you on mind. NOW THE DECEIVERS ARE STILL there in the world because the devil IS NOT YET FINISHED his job. In every season, EVERY TIME THERE WILL BE those who will TRY TO CREEP IN. HOW CAN WE KNOW THEM when they creep in? WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT OUR MESSENGER SAY. HOW CAN WE KNOW? By reading and hearing the message OF OUR DAY. YOU SEE, WHEN THE PASTORS READ THE message and they listen to it and the people listen to the message and they read it, I cannot deceive you. The pastor cannot deceive you. WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE A solid foundation. So what we have had this uh morning just to encourage us. We have been called out. We are not any denomination. By the way, we are denomination. How many were we have Catholics? ROMAN CATHOLICS. YOU SEE, GOD, [screaming] God called you out. God called you out. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WERE ANGRY HERE? How many were angry? GOD'S HANDS AND OTHER RELIGIONS. SOME of you were warriors. How many here were warriors? Oh my God. GOD TOLD YOU OUT. AND ALL OF [screaming] US, LET ME NOW FINISH LIKE THIS. ALL OF US WHEN WE WERE STILL BLIND, WE HAD THE BIBLE IN OUR RELIGION. TELL THEM WE HAD THE BIBLE IN OUR RELIGION, but we were blind. WE HAD A BIBLE, BUT WE WERE BAPTIZING We didn't even know that we are supposed to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We thought God is three. BUT GOD sent a prophet with a message. NOW WHEN WE READ OUR BIBLES, WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE READY. OH, &gt;&gt; I'm [screaming] so GLAD HE BROUGHT ME OUT. TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, I'M SO GLAD HE BROUGHT [screaming] ME OUT. Praise God.

So Pastor Simon, may God bless you. Thank you for the water that has been given. I tell the whole assembly receive and keep it. So I believe that this very sermon that has let us go will still come back. He will be given his time. because of chasing time. So he was supposed to have preached for two hours. So okay though he came late to the pal here but he used this two hours fully. So there is nothing that has been broken in that arrangement. So, so there is the report coming from the kitchen.
