[1:06:34] upright
[1:06:37] fearing God
[1:06:39] an excuse from Evil
[1:06:44] meaning

[1:11:31] hours
[1:11:35] um
[1:11:36] uh We've uh we've been in karamoja
[1:11:40] actually you know the youth meetings
[1:11:42] ended here at
[1:11:45] um what time do you remember the time it
[1:11:46] was past midnight yeah
[1:11:50] so myself I did not sleep at all
[1:11:54] day brother Michael I think slept for
[1:11:56] two hours
[1:11:59] and then by by five sharp we are on by
[1:12:03] five a.m We were on the road
[1:12:06] going to uh
[1:12:09] but I want to say thank you for your
[1:12:11] prayers because the lord gave us a
[1:12:13] successful trip
[1:12:18] and we we visited three different
[1:12:22] locations in karamoja
[1:12:25] tournament
[1:12:26] we visited of course we were sleeping in
[1:12:29] Morocco
[1:12:30] but from morato we would go to cotido
[1:12:33] network
[1:12:36] um
[1:12:45] then we went to
[1:12:48] um we went to Matan also we have two
[1:12:50] Services there
[1:12:52] and also we went to a new place I had
[1:12:55] not gone to this place before it's
[1:12:57] called a longer road
[1:13:01] and in that place it's uh because the
[1:13:06] other I mean we will just go through
[1:13:08] bushes to go there the road is really
[1:13:10] not good
[1:13:15] uh told us
[1:13:18] that we are going on I think it was on
[1:13:22] Thursday side on Thursday we are going
[1:13:24] to a bush
[1:13:26] I was now surprised I mean we thought we
[1:13:30] had gone to a bush so which other Bush
[1:13:32] are we going to now if this is not a
[1:13:34] bush
[1:13:40] it was uh amazing
[1:13:44] so we went in a road it was not tamakt
[1:13:47] of course
[1:13:52] and then we reached in a place where we
[1:13:56] left that road
[1:13:57] and we now went on a cow path
[1:14:02] networks
[1:14:08] and we went into a goat pack
[1:14:13] it went narrowing
[1:14:17] and
[1:14:33] [Applause]
[1:14:34] um
[1:14:35] uh it was a wonderful time we had about
[1:14:39] three or four people who gave their love
[1:14:41] their hearts to Jesus
[1:14:45] and brother Michael preached two
[1:14:48] Services there also
[1:14:51] Services
[1:14:58] you know we hit something I don't know
[1:15:00] of course there was no Road
[1:15:05] and the shock absorber you know pressed
[1:15:10] itself
[1:15:13] and we did not know but by the time
[1:15:16] we're coming out we were just smelling
[1:15:17] you know rubber together
[1:15:22] and by the time we reached on tarmac
[1:15:25] together
[1:15:26] let me go and check what is happening
[1:15:30] I found that the shock absorber was
[1:15:33] pressing itself against the tires
[1:15:38] and part of the tire was eaten away
[1:15:43] so if we had continued driving the tire
[1:15:45] would
[1:15:47] busted and that would be an accident
[1:15:51] so we did not know whether we're going
[1:15:53] to find anywhere to fix it
[1:15:56] but long story short I want to say God
[1:15:58] carried us On Eagle's Wings
[1:16:03] and we were able to find someone to fix
[1:16:06] it
[1:16:08] at least for the moment
[1:16:10] and we found ourselves
[1:16:16] amen me now
[1:16:19] it was a really marathon
[1:16:28] on Monday morning I could not drive
[1:16:32] it was still dark so I wanted to drive
[1:16:36] we had Isaac but I didn't want him to
[1:16:38] drive in the darkness
[1:16:42] but I drove until my eyes were also
[1:16:45] going
[1:16:58] the whole time the lord gave us Grace
[1:17:02] and the mission was 100 successful
[1:17:12] perhaps about a thousand five hundred to
[1:17:14] two thousand people
[1:17:16] wherever we went towards in Canada
[1:17:18] foreign
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:51] they also appreciated God so much for
[1:17:54] the meetings
[1:17:57] Michael is still around he's ministering
[1:17:59] in theater today today and then on
[1:18:01] Monday tomorrow he will be leaving
[1:18:08] he wanted to meet some brothers there
[1:18:10] who he is helping to do some audio
[1:18:12] recordings
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:20] but I tell you what I've had since the
[1:18:22] end of the meetings I've had a lot of
[1:18:24] young people also their pastors calling
[1:18:27] me
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:31] and they've been appreciating
[1:18:34] the meetings that we have heard
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:38] I want I want to say more than what was
[1:18:43] here was online
[1:18:50] we did not I I
[1:18:52] um I don't think that the brothers were
[1:18:54] just at everybody but those who were
[1:18:55] registered here we are 260.
[1:19:03] and uh the pastors I know they're many
[1:19:06] they're coming from many churches about
[1:19:07] 39 or 40 churches
[1:19:13] but a few pastors have taken it upon
[1:19:15] themselves to contact me
[1:19:17] tonight
[1:19:19] and they were really appreciating the
[1:19:22] meetings
[1:19:32] he told me that he was streaming most of
[1:19:34] the meetings online
[1:19:38] because we know that his church
[1:19:40] participated here and we had to think
[1:19:43] about uh in the registration I saw over
[1:19:46] 20 young people from their Church
[1:19:55] um the song leader was from his church
[1:19:57] also
[1:20:01] Pastor semper simple he also appreciated
[1:20:07] also sent some comments
[1:20:10] also we had young people from all these
[1:20:13] pastors churches
[1:20:18] also called me when we are going to
[1:20:21] caramoja
[1:20:24] he was also appreciating the
[1:20:26] arrangements
[1:20:28] we had almost 30 younger people from
[1:20:31] Little Flock so it is
[1:20:39] another Pastor Emma
[1:20:41] um
[1:20:43] also uh Chicago participated we had more
[1:20:47] than 25 from there
[1:20:51] and we had a lot of the young people on
[1:20:54] the musical instruments and also Little
[1:20:56] Rock some of them were musicians
[1:21:01] I want to say
[1:21:03] that these meetings many people that you
[1:21:08] did not even expect
[1:21:10] to really participated fully in these
[1:21:12] meetings
[1:21:18] you imagine to be able to raise
[1:21:21] uh more than actually more than 14
[1:21:24] millions in two weeks David
[1:21:27] million is
[1:21:31] no man does all these things
[1:21:34] it was
[1:21:37] God God is in this he has proved this in
[1:21:41] this cartoon
[1:21:44] and if you notice the impact that the
[1:21:47] meeting's had
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:06] it was a Revival weekend
[1:22:10] so what what more can we expect from
[1:22:13] them
[1:22:15] and it is so appropriate that it
[1:22:17] happened when we are now when they are
[1:22:19] now going to go back to school

[3:36:24] [Music]
[3:36:39] when we close our eyes in prayer
[3:36:45] [Music]
[3:36:50] I wanted to meditate about the words
[3:36:53] that we have had in this service this
[3:36:55] morning
[3:37:02] [Music]
[3:37:04] sometimes things happen in your life
[3:37:07] [Music]
[3:37:10] and maybe
[3:37:13] you might be typed as a sheep
[3:37:17] [Music]
[3:37:19] and I want you to see yourself at this
[3:37:21] time while you close your eyes
[3:37:25] and see yourself as a ship we're having
[3:37:28] idiot sailing on a sea that is
[3:37:34] and then the storms beat around this
[3:37:37] ship
[3:37:39] the storms
[3:37:42] [Music]
[3:37:43] to the extent that all the sails of the
[3:37:46] ship are torn in pieces
[3:37:52] the sea is Raging
[3:37:58] the Sheep is buttered
[3:38:02] down on every side
[3:38:05] and it seems a whole lot like this ship
[3:38:07] is going to sink
[3:38:11] but like we have heard this morning
[3:38:13] there is one thing that can shape the
[3:38:16] sinking ship while watching the church
[3:38:20] that's the anchor in
[3:38:23] the captain of the ship comes out
[3:38:27] and throws that anchor
[3:38:31] deep in the rock of the
[3:38:33] City once
[3:38:35] and that anchor holds on that rock
[3:38:41] the ship might be buttered
[3:38:45] on every side
[3:38:50] but I tell you what as long as the
[3:38:54] anchor holds
[3:38:56] in those rocks
[3:38:59] [Music]
[3:39:03] and maybe there are things that have
[3:39:05] happened in your life
[3:39:08] and it appears it might have sunk you
[3:39:11] into the chaos of life
[3:39:14] or maybe you thought you were going to
[3:39:16] backslide
[3:39:18] maybe you thought you cannot continue on
[3:39:20] this journey
[3:39:28] foreign
[3:39:34] [Music]
[3:39:37] the only thing you need to do is cry
[3:39:39] Jesus you already know color is
[3:39:43] I throw that anchor right there
[3:39:47] in that Rock of Ages
[3:39:50] problems around you storms around you
[3:39:52] may beat Elizabeth
[3:39:56] but you can never sink in them
[3:40:02] [Music]
[3:40:06] thank you
[3:40:08] isn't that something wonderful
[3:40:12] the cares of life may be bit around you
[3:40:17] they may be around me I don't know about
[3:40:20] you but they may be around me
[3:40:23] but it will not sink me

[3:46:37] did a great great work
[3:46:41] I was walking in the hostels

[3:46:48] been calling him
[3:46:50] we did not I don't know Brothers can

[3:46:55] any offering
[3:46:58] no we did not we intended two but we did
[3:47:01] not
[3:47:02] so we didn't give him any offering

[3:47:13] we should uh we should have an offering
[3:47:17] for him
[3:47:18] he has a family
[3:47:24] is not doing it as a job
[3:47:27] he's doing it as a service to the body
[3:47:30] of Christ
[3:47:32] I think I think we need to bless him
[3:47:37] we need to bless him with something
[3:47:41] we are not multitudes here the truly man
[3:47:44] you are no but we can bless him with
[3:47:46] whatever we can
