precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the saint say Amen [Music] [Music] you're most welcome in the presence of the Lord amen you're reading with me of uh Exodus chapter 13 Exodus chapter 13 verses uh 14 oh okay it is Exodus chapter 4 14 uh vers 14 shall I read in the name of the Lord the Lord said uh the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefor Christ and the Lord said unto Moses where far criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but lift thou up thine Road and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on the dry ground through the midst of the sea and behold I will harden the hearts of Egyptian and they shall follow them and I will and I will get and I will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all the host upon his Chariot and upon his Horsemen and the Egyptian shall know that I am the Lord and when I shall and when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh upon his Chariot and upon his Horsemen and the angel of the Lord which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the the pillar of the cloud went for uh went from before their face and stood behind them amen precious father in the name of Jesus we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read Lord I just ask that you come and take over come and give me the inspiration tonight in this few minutes we are going to spend here we just need more of you come and encourage us come and speak to our soul come and set us free in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus amen the Lord bless you may have your seats I just have a thought that I want us to share tonight it's just to encourage us the Bible tells us to confort one another with these words amen This Is The Love Letter between the bride or the groom and the bride and Jesus gave us his word and uh if you look at yourself if you look at your life indeed what has kept you going it's the word of God amen those who have stood like for the last 40 years 50 60 70 30 20 it's because of the written word of God Amen many time when we discouraged you just read the word and you find that you're encouraged and I call my text tonight my Deliverance is coming amen yeah how many believe that their Deliverance is coming our breakthrough our deliverance is coming amen no matter what you're going through no matter what is surrounding us no matter how hard things are but at least one thing we are sure of that our breakthrough or our deliverance is coming amen just as we know that uh God has his right time to do it and we just have to keep believing the word blessed be the name of the Lord and where we have read in Exodus chapter 14 if you begin from verses one the bible say that and and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak to the children of Israel that they turn and ENC Hamp before Pharaoh between uh between migdol and sea over against balison before it shall before it shall ye encamp by the Sea for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel they are in Tangled in the land the Wilderness hath shut them in and I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them God is working on both side now and I will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all his host that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord amen and they did so God knew all the plans of pharaoh he knew all the plans of the Egyptians amen and the same God is giving Moses the direction is instructing Moses what to do the same God instructing Moses what to do is the same God speaking to Pharaoh hardening his heart amen that same God moved before them and told them what Pharaoh was going to do blessed be the name of the Lord and that is the same thing happening today God comes down and tells us what the devil is going to do amen he gives us tips how to maneuver the enemy he pushed the devil to come and then he comes and reveal to us and here where we have read it says that such that they may know that he is the Lord amen amen I will harden Pharaoh's heart and he shall follow after them God is speaking to Moses and I will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all his host that the Egyptian may know that I am the Lord and they did so they did according to what God told them amen their enemies pursuing the children of God and God wanted them to know that indeed he is God Amen amen so these people they were they were in their Journey to the promised land they had challenges because when God called them God never talked about their challenges he never talked about the Wilderness itself amen he never talked about the Red Sea blessed be the name of the Lord but he only told them about the promised land god want us to look at the promise no the hinderance before we we we obtain the promise blessed be the name of the Lord because God when God plans or purpose his plan will have to come to pass no matter what stands on God's way amen that will never fail because it is thus says the Lord but most time the devil comes and scares us the devil creates a situation around us wanting us to remove our eyes from the promise and looked at the St amen when Jesus was leaning when Jesus was in the boat the Bible says that Jesus fell asleep and then the storm Rose the disciples instead of remembering or looking at Jesus they moved their eyes from Jesus to the Sea and that's where the trouble was blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus was watching he wanted to see their action and many time God want to see what next what are you going to do next blessed be the name of the Lord because here the same God is Hing the heart of pharaoh and the more he hard in Pharaoh's heart the more he makes the life of Israel hard amen and at the same time he knows the end game blessed be the name of the Lord just perverted power but the source of power is God himself amen because our Prophet tells us that the devil cannot create but the devil can only pervert the devil can bring sickness and he cannot take away sickness amen so praise be to God [Applause] that's why we have many fake counterfeit Christians you find them in the street pained face Jezebel naked blessed be the name of the Lord but I'm here to tell you this evening that your breakthrough is coming no matter what is going on Amen no matter the challenges we are facing in our life in our homes blessed be the name of the Lord your breakthrough is coming as long as you're child of God as long as you are a Believer because the Bible tells us whosoever comes to God must believe that one is a must there is no debate on that you must believe that God is and let the devil not let the devil not lie you that you are here in vain you have come because you believe that you are coming to meet God and you very sure that God is here and you know that God has ears to hear your prayers and we are sure that God is going to answer every prayer we are making here tonight because he is amen God has ears God has eyes amen he's seeing you he's listening to you the Bible says that he is the high priest who is touched by the feeling of our infirmities the reason ask why Jesus put on flesh God put on flesh in that body called Jesus because he wanted to feel the way we are feeling there is no nothing today no feeling you can bring before God that is strange before him amen because the prophet tells us Jesus was tempted like any other man he was tempted with women he was tempted he was sick at a certain point amen the body was tempted he was in this body and God was trying this body and Jesus went through it when he was on the cross when he said that all is finished amen he meant everything was finished brother I'm here to tell that it is finished Calvary settled it all is up to you to believe to keep confessing trusting in God that mountain will move blessed be the name of the Lord you see the natural is supposed to teach us spiritual you see even when you are digging maybe like a a hall or talk of people who who always uh people who dig like uh ponds when you start it is very easy it's very simple but as you go deeper the deeper you go the harder it becomes there is the point where you reach where you will Hammer maybe with big ax and it's like you you're not prog progressing but you find those guys they will keep on digging blessed be the name of the Lord the way God does his things it is gradually God does not go or violate the law of nature blessed be the name of the Lord amen a woman cannot get pregnant today and gives birth tomorrow it m must follow or go through a process and every month has something to add on that baby blessed be the name of the Lord if you look at even the the life cycle of the toip the frog from the eggs then from there it moves another until it becomes the final frog there's even a point when that thing will have a tail blessed be the name of the Lord amen but those are stages and Perfection the same apply to us Christians we must be tried Amen in that trial sometime it is fire trial sometime it means losing our loved ones amen going through artion going without food going without job blessed be the name of the Lord you find when God works it out for our good praise be to God so I'm here to tell you tonight my brethren that our deliverance is coming the Egyptian were planning God was working God was in this thing he was ing Pharaoh's heart he was giving this how to escape and he was revealing to them how they are going to overcome pharaoh and a certain point he told them that the Egyptian you are seeing today you shall see them no more remember God had made Moses god Moses was a God and Aaron was a prophet so when Moses stood and spoke to them and told them when God told Moses that the Egyptian you are seeing today you'll see them normal maybe if a make a Believer maybe make a believers they laughed say ah sometime people can go crazy how how how because remember the prophet tells us that Egyptian in those days it was the superpower and these are just words the Egyptian you seeing today you will see them no more how it's like youa telling America that the America you're seeing today we shall crush it into pieces you even laugh the weapon God God has used to equip the church is the final amen that's why a True Believer will not run to Prophet so and so there is Prophet so and so when the other one prays even you see lightning why because we know that what we have is the final and God has got his own right time to perform it amen and if you can only believe if you can raise your faith you can provoke God to perform it now in your life amen each time God send his word god want to act upon his word but always it's up to as a Believer either to grasp it and believe it or to Poston it in the future blessed be the name of the Lord much as last on Wednesday we talking about the man at the pool of beida but I also believe that if that man had believed God because in the courts of law if the if the victim accept that is guilty but if you don't you know that you a criminal you committed offense and you don't admit no I believe the same thing work even this side brother sister we can provoke God to perform spanio in our midst amen many times because we don't read the word but each time you read the Bible each time you listen to the message message it provokes your faith you hear how God moves in the service and you ask yourself where is this amen where is the god of the message who creates the missing limbs for me I have my problem leave my alone I have my sickness brother sister it's not your sickness it is the devil's sickness you are not the devil's accountant you are the one keeping his sickness keeping his trouble keeping his sorrow no sir we are children of God we are different people amen we have another spirit and that is the spirit of God we come from the kingdom amen that cannot be shaken the kingdom that cannot be moved that's where we belong that's where we came from we are the children of God when we speak God listened when we cry he hears our cry when we pray answers our prayer and each one of us here we have answered prayers amen and you sit there are witness that God answers prayer many time the devil make us to forget these things and think you are not just coming to church in vain the reason as you are coming until today it is because at a certain point God answered your prayers and you know that this thing works blessed be the name of the Lord why don't you go if they if they don't work you come because they work that's why we should not forget our testimonies David used the past testimony to overcome the giant praise be to God but most time God helpes you to go through some something then you reach a then you forget and start murmuring the bible say that God made them to go through the Wilderness because he wanted to know what was in their heart when God called them out of Egypt he called them they were mixed multitude and even Moses did not have the seve he not have the way of sing this Mak multitude blessed be the name of the Lord idolators came out of Egypt to go to the promised land melas came out of Egypt to go to the promised land fornicators blessed be the name of the Lord but God had his SE in the wilderness praise be to God that's why the Bible tells us that we should work our salvation with fear and trembling because there is a point where you are not going to go through amen and where the church is reaching today we are reaching in the narrow way because the life is the life like the life have moved from the stock the leave to the seed now praise be to God that's why today you can easily identify praise be to God we are the Omega bride Omega Church the last race Runner praise be to God as who is going to accomplish this race it is who is going to build this church is you is going to be to buy this land praise be to God it is you is going to support this ministry it is us to support the radio program it is us support the TV program it is us to buy the church land we have the potential amen because God has interested us with this ministry why are you not in water tonight why are you not in another church why are you not in Miracle Center why are you in the days of voice the days of the voice you think but God before the foundation of the world so brother po seated there amen God saw you here each one of us the way we are placed tonight God saw you very well seated there he even knows what you are thinking about his word whether you are swallowing the word oh you are despising it but let me tell you the more you disbel the word the more the angel of the Lord will bypass you not until you believe amen and say God enough is enough this is my time because the violent take it by force praise be to God Amen Believers are not soft when it comes to things of God Believers ought to be ragged ruged faith ruged in prayer [Applause] amen because the devil is also a rugged guy the devil is not just a guy uhuh because the devil also knows the person is fighting with that's why we ought to be ragged Christians we hold the word of God in a rugged way we believe it in a rugged way amen we look at things impossible as possible we wrestle with with sickness in a worked way he say you are going to the H I'm not going you are going don't you say that you feeling the temperature is high said no the temperature is low why don't you cover yourself no I will not cover myself even this jacket I will put it aside oh the back is Wi on you SE I will not sit I'll move around singing the praise of God that is how we ow to be amen God does not use people who are a coward he's the captain of the host of the Lord a coward Captain will destroy the whole Army praise be to God we are undergoing a training here we are not here just to sit we're not here just to relax we are not here just to chill we're not here for a picnic but we are undergoing a training amen and the Lord Telles men and women who are here praise be to God maybe others will be pastors wives God raise pastors out of this church he will raise missionar out of this church that is why God called you to come here praise be to God we are undergoing our training and one day the Lord Tes and giving us a good health you will find maybe brother budy pastoring a church of 100 or th000 people praise be to God we ought to stand like Moses of old to look at the benefit in Christ amen we look beyond the things of the world you look beyond your marriage that you are not there to raise only children but you are nurturing or imparting the life of Christian in those children because you are seeing potential in them praise be to God that when we are handling them you know that I'm handling a song singer when you're handling you a young boy I'm handling a preacher praise be to God praise the Lord for our breakthrough is coming brother Bram in the message s see Jesus says that we must confess that that he has done it it and he cannot do it until we confess it praise be to God you must confess that God has done it whether you're feeling it or not whether you're seeing it or not whether the thing seems to be dark or not you have to confess and believe that the Lord has done it do you believe that Jesus died yes you believe do you believe that Jesus heals you yeah but if there's a b then you don't believe that Jesus died for you praise be to God God made it so funny in the way that all our spiritual weapon they invisible can you see Faith Can You Feel faith butam says faith is unconscious that's why you never find a True Believer fighting with demon no no praise be to God we pray and we believe even when the symptom is still there we just go believing that we are healed period the Lord has said it we believe it we receive it and we move on and we should also a good way we have to reach that point of realiz you are not okay praise be to God there is no scripture in the Bible where God came in the camp and somewhere just there like Sinners will even faint collapse when the presence of God comes down they will not be gazing no praise be to God remember we have reached the Finishing Line the seals are open they may say we know all the messengers of the church age Church ages we know the person of the Holy Ghost is we know that without the Holy Ghost no way praise be to God we know the we know the the uh all the comings of Jesus Christ from the first coming the second the third praise be to God we are no longer in darkness we ought to be more serious than any other Christians in the world but where is that Zeal it's because we have forgotten our promise some believer us think they're still here for another 100 years maybe you never know but our Prophet tells us we have to pray as if we are going the next hour we have to work as if we still here for another 100 years plus you have never prayed and enter in the spirit and you are just okay you are growing physically mentally and dying spiritually but when I'm say I rather I rather be blind physically but when spiritually I'm okay praise be to God Simeon was blind physically because he was not seeing but spiritually he was okay and one day when the promise was fulfilled the Holy Ghost moved upon Simeon amen it was the Holy Ghost that moved upon him the Bible say the Holy Ghost led him to the temple how did Simeon knew that Jesus was born and that brought him to for dedication the Holy Ghost spoke to him who led demon to the temple the Holy Ghost led him brother sister be led of the Holy Ghost and when he received the baby and he pray say God let your servant rest in peace let him go in peace for my eyes not physical eyes brother my eyes have seen praise be to God God is more interested in our spiritual eyes because our physical eyes that sees nonsense this and that and but when our spiritual eyes is open our spiritual mind amen and we know the time we are living in and we know the promise of God in our life we know what God has promised us do you know that even in a normal life sometime you sit there and you do like in ventor in your life and you say now you see I'm growing by the way but I've not finished this I've not accomplished this and this and this and this sometime you find other people they then they become like scared others go into depression they look at say now the same thing spiritually why don't we do the same spiritual inventory of Our Lives you say ever since I believed but up to now I am still lasting after women am I okay when things are not moving right in our lives we go and see doctors and when we reach there we expose everything to them doctor you know what I have a boil here I have a boil here another one is here can I have a a oh yes sure sure and you're not even but when we come to God we want to cover our boils when God comes and speaks that brother is just against me when the word comes and the Holy Ghost direct you the right say uhh for do not be deceived there is no more time to waste the bible say that when Jesus heard that John was cast in prison and from that time he started preaching the gospel telling them to repent for the kingdom of God is at hand Jesus himself he was still here in flesh and was preaching the gospel telling the world that the kingdom of God is at hand how about today there is no more time to play I don't want to be disappointed on that day that day is coming it is real real it amen it has ever happened the world has never been destroyed by God God rain fire on Sodom the same God rain water during the time of the days of Noah that's e if it mean clap clap your hands not to man but to God if it is singing please sing to the Lord you will perish with that voice it will erro the wigot tail will enjoy that that throat hey there are people who cannot even sit because they have backbone problem they people cannot even sit for 10 minutes but God has given us that opportunity he has given you that chance and you are not utilizing it when kekel was in trouble he remember the good thing he has done to the Lord he said God remember me I have walked perfect before you add meor what do you have tonight that you can tell the Lord that I missed all the services in a year I don't church 20 or 40 times blessed be the name of the Lord but I'm here to tell you tonight if you've come prepared you breakthrough your deliverance is here because God sent his word and his word delivers us amen it's up to you to believe that word lean not on your understanding many time Believers explain a lot you know you just can't understand what I'm going through you just can't understand what that brother did to me if we see if you can give me 30 minutes or 2 hours or even one full week it's not enough for me to explain how that brother how that sister what she did to me and from and you know what for me I just come because you know okay you need to be delivered blessed be the name of the Lord he say if we confess that he has done it he canot do it until you confess the other day I asked sister Agatha's daughter fbe how are you feeling now she said I was told that I should confess that I'm feeling better and because of that I'm feeling better he that's not a bad State brother Bram prayed for a blind man and told him that you are healed and the man believed that he was healed and he left he came back in the prayer line again andam asked him what are you doing here he said the other day Minister he said that I was healed butam also told him but you told that you you also you believe that you are healed he say yes I believed are you still believing yes okay go believing and when confessing I'm Healed I can see I can see I can see amen sometime it takes it may take months weeks even years but finally one day it will come to pass because when that word goes out of God's mouth it cannot return says the word it will never turn VY no matter how dark it may seems to be but there is a ray of light in that Darkness praise be to God for those who raise who have like chicken at home when it is hashing time sometime when you get that egg and you kind of start shaking it you will hear the sound of the cheek inside without seeing any crack blessed be the name of the Lord and you'll never find Mother hand taking on on the egg and that's what Believers always want to do you never find the mother and like scratching the egg pecking it you man what are you doing there you K 21 days I've been here waiting and now I'm hearing you and you're not coming out no sir it will wait amen you find it enjoying arranging those eggs properly and it and when that time reaches Brethren it will even regulate it is going out to look for food why because something is happening life is coming out amen if it used to go like three times four times a day it will start going like once or not even going at all why because it has like it has had the sound of the cheek the baby chicken is coming praise be to God but sometime in church it is opposite when the word is H and the Holy Ghost is moving that's where you find a Believer going out brother sister the devil is shating you the devil is cheating on you because he knows that it is your time then he said boys do you know what you need to go for a short call and you're like one and the moment you put it one and you feel like you are dying you have to rush out there that's when you miss it blessed be the name of the Lord but that hand will be there because he knows it is time now for breaking through amen the churches must believe every a and claim for it for themselves you must believe and you must claim for it my sister ES your mom will not claim it for you let me tell you sister is there sometime you find out raising chickens at our home but living alone the mother hand covering the egg even the chick they have a role to play they start picking it from inside outside blessed be the name of the Lord and that is the life of a Christian it is in out that true life come from inside and manifested outside and the mother will put the condition and the rest will be upon the cheeks God will give us his word he will give us the Holy Ghost but the remaining one is for you he sh you to believe that the Holy Ghost belongs belongs to you and you claim for it it's not going to come from glory and park with the Holy Ghost God does not work that way amen blessed be the name of the Lord you must claim it yourself but that is the great thing to expect something usually what you expect is what you get you can never go above your confession God's purpose cannot be defeated there is nothing that can defeat the purpose of God that's why when they saw that the enemies were coming God encouraged them and told them that the Egyptian you are seeing today you will not see them again why because God had purpose in their life and God knew that all the gods of Egypt all the waves of Egypt all the Demons of Egypt all the host of Egypt could not defeat that purpose what God is valuing in your life is his purpose in you not the way you look but for me the J ma no there is a purpose in that Tabernacle and the owner of that purpose will take care of that Tabernacle until that purpose is manifested amen when God put a seed in you that seed cannot fail that seed cannot be premature amen that seed will have to germinate that's why when Jonah was in the bottom of the sea the seed of God In Jonah had to come out and sprang in na praise be to God that is what God is following in our lives when you are sure of your calling and election the rest you leave it to God you know he said he chose us we never chose God for [Applause] and you think that the parents B to take care of their children our God is more than able more than dound to take care of his church to take care of his minister to take care of his children there are many things that would have happened upon your life but God has been there and you know these things there isn't enough power in hell in the message what does it take to make a Christian Life there isn't enough power in all hell that can ever defeat the purpose of God even R could not defeat the purpose of God the Bible says when they reached there the pillar of fire moved behind them amen and God looked at them and that was the end of them to them who believe all things are possible God never told us to figure these things out no sir will I make it really sister can you also be sincere and tell us how many times have you been walking carefully you just walk properly just imagine look at this you are going to you are looking at where you are going your feet already God direct this feet physically how about spiritually that's why the Bible said the word of the Lord is the lamp to our feet blessed be the name of the Lord I want us to read Psalms chapter 66 vers 12 Psalm 6612 he said thou H has caused men to ride over our heads we went through fire and through water but thou broughtest us out into a wethy Place praise be to God are you going through fire are you going through waterers God will bring you out to a worth the place don't look at your Waters some through the waters some through the fire amen some goes through the mountain others goes through the dark Valley but all through the blood this was David's testimony he brought them through the waters he brought them through the fire but finally the Lord brought them to a wealthy Place amen that's why I'm here to tell you church that your deliverance is coming your deliverance is here amen God has fought many many of our battles he has shown us kindness we have annoyed him many times sometime you Rebel with a full knowledge and you disobey God but still God H forgive you go back and you cry then God forgives you it's because of that purpose blessed be the name of the Lord amen no matter what we are facing that is the truth not just excit but that is the truth when all Heaven turn lose all hell turn lose too but when all hell turn lose Heaven turn lose too when Paul was in prison the devil thought that was the end of Paul and maybe physical part of Paul thought that was his End Amen but God had a mega plan upon his life Paul was there just waiting on God and the Holy Ghost inspired them to sing praise amen and when they were doing that in shame the Deliverance was coming praise be to God many time when we begin to pray you feel like prayer is not moving you feel like I mean it's not even going over your head but one thing I can tell you tonight just keep praying something is happening [Applause] amen when you when you try to make a hole on this pillar you cannot hit it once and then the Chisel goes through it sometime when we are doing our pluming work there is where you have to Chisel a colons or a tach but chiseling a space where 1 in pipe or half inch can go through brother most people during internship that's where they that's when they quit I say may let me try Saloon amen and when you have a bad instructor he will tell you he will bring maybe 4 in pipe and tell you I want this pipe disappear in the wall and brother you will maybe you'll choose a qu inch maybe like a half meter or quarter meter you'll go home with all your hands paining but in the the back of your mind you already know that even tomorrow the thing is still waiting for you you come back again for the second day the third day and when you're looking at where you are going where you you to go cross through Bal Road praise be to God look at the National Water Guys you find them digging the trench a small one but they have to go through pvas they have to go through tach they have to go under the roof sorry the uh The Roots sometime Things become so hard and they have to come and pour the water and wait for it at least to be soften a little bit then they come back tomorrow blessed be the name of the Lord that is the same procedia God is using amen God comes with the water of the word and pours it in your strong heart and by and by it starts softening amen that's why the bible say that the word of God is like a big hmer that breaks amen so what I'm trying to say keep on chiseling amen when you come to church today and you feel you're out of church come again tomorrow Jes you are part again when you feel like today yeah things are okay come back another day when you come that feel like it's even worse come back another day amen by the time you realize brother sister you will hit the last Hammer amen and the Jes will go through the wall and that is the work of the Gospel it is preached from January to January but one thing I'm sure of you are not remaining the same something's happening in your life you may not even realize it but the devil knows it because this word cannot turn the same it cannot whether you believe it or not when you believe it gives you life when you reject still the word will judge you so it cannot go back the same praise be to God but because that hope is there that one of these days I will fix my pipe on this wall but Believers we like too much technology because nowadays there are wall breakers you just come and then it goes through but God has no wall breakers there's no shortcut with God you have to follow the old way that's why he says in Jeremiah go back and stand at the junction amen ask for that all the path and walk therein amen go back to the old path there is no shortcut with God when Moses ran out of Egypt Moses God never told Moses that now since that time you came running you are go back using migs you're just going to bombard every city no sir when he met God God told him you're going back the same way you came the same way you're going back but this time around you are a God now Aaron is your Prophet blessed be the name of the Lord so this time round Moses still had to go back and face the same same enemy he ran from but this time round something had happened the same thing that happened to Jacob is meeting the same Esau the same brother in the same family but something had happened around him or in his life blessed be the name of the Lord and every Christian must have that experience do not be deceived if you don't get that experience one of these days you're going to be drifted away Sisters You better get that experience because if not don't be surprised when you find yourself you are the ninth wife to a certain H in a certain or certain IM in a certain MOS what will keep you what will keep that brother from from not becoming apologist it is that experience and that experience is good here and that is the Deliverance I'm talking talking about blessed be the name of the Lord the Holy Ghost comes first then other things happen don't remain when you are just Justified don't only stop with sanctification you know when you're Sanctified I think that is the most dangerous stage because remember the Holy Ghost has not sat in that heart you are just clean you don't lie you don't cheat you don't fornicate you are just there but remember when unclean Spirit goes out of that house it moves in the dry and brother James so he goes and call more strong demons that's what the Bible says and say the condition of that person will be worse so don't only stop there be sure somebody is SE there be sure the holy spirit is in that heart be sure ask God am I filled with the Holy Spirit keep seeking amen even those who think they have even those who have keep believing God to be revealed again and again and again blessed be the name of the Lord amen we just have to take God's word shall we stand on our feet we just have to take God's word for eat and start rejoicing something will happen that brings the word to Life As We water it with praise can you imagine let us just take God take God's word and it start and and start rejoicing something will happen that brings the world to Life as we start we water it with praise when Po in chain amen they believed in the word of God they started watering that word with praise and guess what shanes broke Peter thought was finished maybe some even but amen we have to reach that point where we should where we have to face death and say a this time round no sir we have we must reach that point where we are going to refuse no to take no for an answer this no no no then they started singing amen they started watering that word with praise God is so good maybe he's so good so good good to me he set us free he set him free he set him free he's so good to me he remembered the sermons he was preaching he remember the God who pour the Holy Ghost he remember The God Who heals he remember the signs and wonders amen and his facei started building up and the angel appeared in prison and delivered him out of prison and the Brethren who were in that brother's house praying when Peter knocked sister called Rod went and then she came back with glest excitement said guess what that's how Christian are you pray God answers your prayer you see a miracle you have a miracle in your hand and you say I can't believe it I can't but you have it you are holding it God has answered your prayer amen precious Lord Jesus
