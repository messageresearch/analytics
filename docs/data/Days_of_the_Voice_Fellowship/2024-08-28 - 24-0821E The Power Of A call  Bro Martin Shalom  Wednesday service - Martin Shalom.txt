come expecting I believe the Lord will whisper to you yeah just pray for me that the holy spirit will have his own way amen I want us turn to our Bibles and read with me Philippians chapter 3 pH ver 12 [Music] pH now as though I had already attained okay okay shall let us begin from vers s it says we are reading in the name of the Lord Jesus but what things were gained to me those that I counted counted loss for Christ yeah doubtless and I count all things but L for the Excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the laws of all things and and do count them but done that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through uh the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the The Fellowship of uh of his suffering being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain if by any means I might attain un the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either we already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not my soul to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting the things which is the things but forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto these things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus for for for [Music] dear Jesus Lord we've read the sa word I just pray that may the whole Spirit come and give the inspiration T may you speak to each and every Angry heart encourage those who are downcast heal the broken heart and fill us with the holy spirit it's only you who make a service Lord you say that because of the anointing the Yoke will be BR release your anointing tonight in the mighty way that every shackles will be lost heal those who are sick in the body restore those who are fallly revive those Lord who are weak may you anoint my interpreting brother circumcise our ears and our hearts to receive this word in Christ Jesus we pray amen praise the Lord may you have your seats are you happy to be in the presence of the Lord amen [Music] yeah it's quiet sometime uh but I thank God that he has giv me the grace this evening yeah I always say it's one of uh each time I stand here I feel nervous yeah and but I know God is faithful amen yeah this evening I have a thought that I want us to share uh I've ever preached here on this very scripture but today I want to try to take another Direction and I will call it the power of a [Music] call blessed be the name of the Lord amen I know the word call uh is a common word sometime there's a okay there's that call of maybe a phone call amen but today I want to talk about God's calling so the power of a call amen how many believe that they are called amen blessed be the name of the Lord and this time round is not man calling you but it's God calling man blessed be the name of the Lord amen this word calling this holy calling is the Bible says that we are called with a holy calling is not something common amen and when God calls you you have to respond blessed be the name of the Lord because the calling of God go as far as for knowledge is concerned and the calling of God is election that's God's election blessed be the name of the Lord and tonight I want us to talk about the power of that c you are here because of the power of that c you would have not been here tonight but because God moved in your heart amen one day were outside there like any other people blessed be the name of the Lord but we were not common people because regardless of us being out there we heard the calling of God in our life blessed be the name of the Lord and I'm here to tell you this evening that we are not common people we are special people who are called by God Amen that's why we all to be happy we all to be proud because God called us amen we God called men and women those who are predestinated by God who are elected by God who are chosen by God who are set aside by God for a special purpose amen and there is power in that call and the power in that call there's now no Force there's no power that can stop that c there's no power that can hinder you there's no power that can withstand you because the creator of heavens and earth called you amen and let the devil know that you are called by God you are chosen by God you are elected by God you are prepared by God you are ordained by God God is preparing you amen and even the devil cannot stop that blessed be the name of the Lord amen you know when God calls you God is uh uh the way God does his things he prepare end from the beginning he works on you and finish his work and leaves your part to play so we are playing the finished work of amen for the Bible says Foundation of God is sure amen whatever God started in the beginning whatever God started before the foundation of the world you will have to accomplish it and nothing can stop that amen we are unstoppable people there is no situation under the sun there is no weapon that can stop us amen because we are here for a purpose and that purpose must be accomplished blessed be the name of the Lord amen and this call identify as as the chosen one blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says that many are called but Fe [Music] are but we are the people who are C and chosen and you not among the the few you are not among the cold one alone but God called you God chose you amen and that's why you are here blessed be the name of the Lord and because you are chosen by God that's why the grace of God is moving us on every single day blessed be the name of the Lord amen we are bought with a price because we are chosen by God and because we were chosen by God that had to take God himself to come down to redeem us amen No Angel shows you we are not chosen by Bishops we are not chosen by pastors we are not chosen by evangelist but we are chosen by God [Applause] Amen and that's why we are following the word of God if you are chosen by man anytime that man can cancel you anytime he can kick you out he can disappoint you blessed be the name of the Lord that's why the Bible says make your calling and election sure amen when you are truly assuredly known that you are chosen by God can shake you amen you will move his shoulders High you will face the storm because you know the mass of the Storm shows you you will not be shaken by a stress because the god of Heaven is the one who shows you now I want to tell you this evening that there is a power in God's calling when God calls man there is a power behind that calling amen and it's that power that keeps us moving you remember when God sent Moses to Egypt after Moses had ran out of Egypt and God met him in the wilderness amen Moses blessed be the name of the Lord he knew that God had called him he knew that he was chosen but it was not Moses right time to do that job he was supposed to wait on God for God's instruction that now is the time like the Gideon of old amen he told God if you're in our M where is your Miracle Gideon was waiting for God's command blessed be the name of the Lord so when Moses after killing the Egyptian and he flee from Egypt blessed be the name of the Lord and the Bible says one day he was Ring Jeth animal and he saw the pill of Fire and the pill of fire attracted him blessed be the name of the lord always the super will attract a True Believer God us to attract a Believer blessed be the name of the Lord but when you find a brother or sister is getting stumbled when he seeing happening in our you just know there is something wrong with that person when Moses saw the bush burning it attracted his attention let's say be the name of the Lord and Moses drw close to the the burning bush and came out of the bur Bush and told him remove your shoes for the place where you start is a Holy Ground blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallu I believe maybe that evening Moses's dad amen maybe had a very hard time in prayer maybe praying and prayer was like prayer was not going through but that very moment something was happening there God was meeting somebody in the wilderness blessed be the name of the Lord amen and when God met Moses he gave him now a commission and he told and he sent him to Egypt blessed be the name of the Lord the man the man who ran out of Egypt this time he's going back with a staff the prophet say that when you ask Moses where are you going tell that I'm going to overthrow Egypt blessed be the name of the Lord it wasn't because Moses was moving with a stick but there was the power in Moses's go he had made theal amen and he knew he was no longer alone amen and this was God in man speak where are you going Moses I'm going to overthrow Egypt amen because something had happened in the wildness blessed be the name of the Lord and Moses was no longer that C Moses when God bless a call in your life he protect that call he become so envious to that call amen he secures you that nothing can harm you because you have something precious in your life blessed be the name of the Lorden and after you've realized that you cannot live a life again you will be a True Believer because you know you have a call of God in your life you will not behave like others you will not talk like others blessed be the name of the Lord because you have something special in your life blessed be the name of the Lord amen Apostle Paul say that now as though that if anybody if if by any means I might attain un the resurrection of the Dead not as though I have already attained either we are already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing do forgetting those things which are behind amen amen forgetting those things which are behind blessed be the name of the Lord when God calls us he want us to forget what is behind us amen all of us we know our behind each one of us knows their past and I'm sure none of us have good pastor sometime we even don't want to look there amen and that's why God is telling us we have to look forward amen that's where our inheritance lies you see even when you're driving you cannot drive while looking in the r VI metor you w reach far you will get an accident amen amen but most time Believers we want to look back blessed be the name of the Lord but the scripture tells us we ought to get what is behind us and look at what is ahead of us blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen so there is a power in the call of God when God calls man he equs that man he gives him his authority he protect that man amen however much you want sometime you find when you are tempted and you almost almost falling temptation but because of the power of that go something lifts you out of Amen each one of us we have been tempted we are tempted every day but if you're a child of God Amen you cannot allow the devil God cannot allow the time that's why when God called us he never left us alone amen blessed be the name of the Lord because he knew that will not make it but when God called us he gave us something special praise be to God and that is the power of the of of of his call hallelujah hallelujah even when the country send an [Music] ambassador he gives that Ambassador all the authority and that Ambassador is as good as the president of that nation and when God send us he gives us the same Authority blessed be the name of the Lord sometime the devil make us forget he make us think that we are like any other Ordinary People but let me tell you even when you go among the Egyptians they will really recognize they will tell you that you are different even when you are trying to do what they are doing why because of the power of the call of God in your life there's no way you can blend with them praise be to God Amen I press to the mark the price of High Calling of God in Christ Jesus this is High Calling which is in Christ Jesus is not ordinary calling it's not normal calling but this High Calling is in Christ Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord and that is the kind of call we are called by God blessed be the name of the Lord amen and what is keeping us going tonight is the power of that call many times that Dev Tred to destroy our lives but the power of that call has apprehended us amen sometime and when you are traveling you are in the bus or you are in the B border the devil come with the intention of destroying your Liv blessed be the name of the Lord but because of the power of of the call of God in our lives God has preserved Our Lives blessed be the name of the Lord and I'm here to tell you tonight that this is the time for you to look at the Devil and tell the devil that I'm going nowhere because God called me because God shows me amen not yesterday our names are written in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and no man can raas our name no devil can raise it no Bishop can raise it no can erase it brother no C can erase that name our name is in the mind of God Amen is written by the blood of the L before the foundation of the world Amen our name is older than the devil because before the devil was created God SL the lamb amen and collected the blood and Di his finger on that blood and wrote our names down amen our names are in the hard disk of God and where is that hard dis where is that dis is not in the computer but it's in the mind of God where no man where are no Force where are no demons can erase that blessed be the name of the Lord amen and when God was creating the World by the power of the spoken word when spoke let there be we were in his mind amen blessed be the name of the Lord warming when he was creating the when he said Let It Be and it happened the mind of God and that was you and me because God had not amen there were some people who were coming in His image and God was longing to see his image amen hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and I want to tell you brother sister amen that we even order on the Devil Himself amen we are the ancient before the dev and when we recognize who we are that's why we become the my to the devil the devil sees two personalities in us he sees this flesh and another mysterious he was the son of God why because Jesus had two personalities amen when he sees this one he sees the flesh this cannot be God the other day he slept in the boat there they slept that can be the God God in flesh God in flesh do you know God the devil was telling his demons Lucifer was telling his demons that one cannot be God do you know God is because he knew God Lu told that he knew God but you cannot know God you cannot explain God you cannot understand God every time when you think that you have God he's a Thousand Mile ahead of you that's why the Bible says the Lord go before us and fight our enemies the same God is before you the same God is walking with you the same God behind you blessed be the name of the Lord amen and when the devil saw Jesus he couldn't believe that is God when he sees you tonight I say this can't be this can't be the chosen one the other day he lied blessed be the name of the Lord but when you come before God and you repent of your sins and you confess your sins amen and the blood of Jesus is released in your life and you are perfect with Jesus's righteous looks at you again that is who we are why because before the foundation of the world there are people whose names were written men and women elected by God blessed be the name of the Lord that's why when man fell in head amen God came from Glory blessed be the name of the Lord amen blessed be the name of the Lord Brother can you come just praise be to God amen blessed be the name of the Lord so my brother my sister just be sure that you are called by God after you are sure you have made your calling an election sure let me tell you you become a supernatural man amen that's when you will know that the devil is nothing before us amen that's when you will know blessed be the name of the Lord that Calvary Paid It All blessed be the name of the Lord amen when Jesus we Lazarus grave again the devil say I told you blessed be the name of the Lord he can't be God the one we are serving there I never SE I've never seen him crying but this one who wept [Music] but blessed the name of the Lord amen praise the Lord there is something about the power of call the power of Call Of God you see when men were called by the devil they tend to be somehow not ordinary yes sir you heard of The L there's a man who they used to worship as God in Western Uganda somebody told us but you see you see that man he can make it rain on you only where you were standing and even the and even the flood will do blessed be the name of the Lord and they started worshiping him but let me tell you brother sister there is a God the creator of the heavens and earth he thundered in the beginning amen when the world came into existence he spoke and said let there be amen and The World Is Still Standing today he knows the mechanism of the Sun how drive it from east to west blessed be the name of the Lord just imagine that is a man that is the great one who called you to help him command the son praise be to God one day you were in your village or you were in the market somewhere and some gentleman came preaching the word and when you heard the gospel something compelled you what was that the part of God Amen and that was just the beginning and from that time God started unfolding to you and today you know the godhead today you know the true baptism today you know the serpent se you know about that woman Jezebel you know about the unit of churches amen and the same God is still is still unfolding for us in one of these days blessed be the name of the Lord we shall come to our realization we shall know that indeed we have been the children of God and we are and that's why the Bible tells us now you are the sons of God blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus there was a man in the pool of Betha he had been there for 38 years he was paralyzed nobody could help him to throw him in the pool once a year every year amen the angel come and stray the water F in the PO was healed blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah for 10 years he was there 15 years he was there 20 years he was there blessed be the name of the Lord and for the time he was there I believe because the book is so big every day I remember one time pastor preached a message I God disappointed time brother sister let me tell you something Amen in the Lamb's Book of Life every believe the Angels open pages and they brother another year they open another one every service they open another one his name is called you may be in that situation maybe for two years maybe for 10 years but let me tell you your time is coming keep pressing on keep clinging to the faith keep holding to the word amen the man was there for 38 years I believe in the 37th years always when God is mation is about to occur to you something begins to happen blessed be the name of the Lord do you think Sarah gave birth when she was old woman didn't but restored her and I believe when the time was getting close sah realized her body was changing amen amen maybe flat flat he was now raising blessed be the name of the Lord amen her strength was regained and maybe could go to Abraham and tell Abraham I'm not understand what's happening to me darling do you know that even you youve changed he used to have flat I'm seeing some TW I used to walk like this I'm see should remember promise blessed be the name of the Lord what am I trying to say this man was there for 38 years but I believe in the 37th year something started off the Angels were getting close to his praise be to God and when Jesus went there hallelujah amen amenu Jesus passed his way why the power of God was upon the life of the man the full of and that power is what draws Jesus amen because before the foundation of the world he was in God's mind God had prepared is heing and when his time came there was no need for fearing water this same round it was not dipping yourself into the pool oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody has not grasp it the order was you have to be near the pool I believe it if it was in this day we living the scientist would have come out with a gag maybe like rder which can detect something and I believe maybe the healing would be because they see the light they just and I believe some even feared water but because of the condition they were in and this man was there but when his turn comes was different story not dipping your Sol the amen this time it was exercising his faith by the power of the spoken word amen and when Jesus reached him he asked him what I doing here he started explaining you know for the last 30 years whenever I'm trying to someone else amen so Jesus not want too much explanation it is the witch doctors who explain a lot you see that headache it came because you were neighbor and you you step grandfather but when Jesus come the temp's power is broken when Jesus drew the near the pool the fs were already shaking demons already trembling amen because the master had come all those who sat in darkness they saw that great that great light has come blessed be the name of the Lord and when Jesus reached the P he told him pick your bed and go hallelujah amen sometime The Devil Makes You Makes You camp in that condition until you think it is normal you say forication is normal with me you say last is normal with me and you camp there and even you get electricity to give you life this man had been his bed there says the Bible yes sir he was there for 38 years he had become he was a resident blessed be the name of the Lord why is the gospel being preached the gospel is preached to sprank us BL our mind for those sh to go away and by the preaching of the Gospel which is the power of God and salvation when the word goes for that's when a Believer realized that all along have been cing in a wrong place blessed be the name of the Lord amen Jesus told him pick up your bed Jesus who is the same yesterday who is the same today and forever no matter I don't care the camp you are coming into but that Jesus is moving the congregation tonight amen he want to visit you if you can open your hearts and if you believe that you are called by God that same God is here tonight to deal with your situation am blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen when you have the call of God in your life no matter where you there was a man called Jonah amen this man was a prophet of God he had a call of God in his life God instructed him to go to n but this man rebelled against God but because he had the call of God Amen there is power in the call of God hallelujah amen amen he went and hid himself hallelujah hallelujah he said I'm going to Talus I don't know the business he had in Talus the mastered Maybe started maybe had Hotel there maybe had a relative there and said let me go and amen sometime when things get tense at work B tend to run for leave and they leave pressure to this the one who for to the one who are lower than them blessed be the name of the Lord need to rest a bit blessed be the name of the Lord but he forgot that the eye of God is moving all over the Earth God saw his plan God saw his arrangements and God say that now since you not want to use this transport I'm going to give you another one a special one blessed be the name of the Lord why because the call of God was in the life of Jonah amen that call of God is the anchor that is what hold a Believer no matter where you are going as long as that call is in your life God will pull you out amen whether you are in the bar amen maybe you are there outside there and you are battling with adultery fing with fornication you are fighting with lust but let me tell you if you're a child of God and the call of God is in your life God is going to call you out the grace of God is going to reach you there the power of go is the grace of God Amen that Grace draws God from Glory because when man s hallelujah hallelujah God could not forget man because man was blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus man was in that dis called you know when you do compartment in your computer where operating system is and other files and other blessed be the name of the Lord that's why God could not forget money every time could scr remembers that love compelled God let me go there let me go my soul I have the remedy what was that the power of the call of God in the life of man BL said be the name of the Lord Jesus talk of that woman the woman at the well blessed be the name of the Lord she had seven men she had six and she made the seventh one but this one was that was the the day of her Jubilee there was a part of there was a call of God in her life and she didn't know at all she was living in prostitution but she never knew that before the foundation of the world Amen God had called her blessed be the name of the Lord sometime when we are living in our lowly state that Devil Makes Us think that we are not children of God it tells you not even saved and indeed you start believing that but I'm here to challenge you you were saved by the when God was saving you amen it was unconditional Covenant he never told you that when you feel like you saved then you are Sav no sir Christian don't rely on feelings we stand in faith amen amen F the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of the things you don't see you tell the devil I don't see salvation but one thing I'm sure all I am a Christian I am saved because Jesus said so the word said so he has given me the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord that is the power of the call hallelujah how many are called here yes sir God bless you blessed be the name of the Lord this woman was there and she had something unique because when Jesus spoke to her she said I perceive your prophet I believe that woman was religious and if could not made such a statement she used to go for for morning noen maybe she used to count rosaries maybe she used to take maybe she was I mean she was religious person but her religion could not deliver her it had to take Jesus the man of the much they could read him the scroll I believe that could not help him it had to take the scroll itself walking on fles and when the scroll came his way hallelujah amen the man picked his bed and went home and the Bible tells us Jesus said as was in his first coming shall it be in his second coming blessed be the name of the Lord this word put on flesh in the beginning the same word is putting on flesh today and God ising you and me blessed be the name of the Lord amen that out of cold nothing can blow it when Jonah was in the bottom of the sea it was a good example of a seed of God time came the same God who made him went that way he started disturb the sea St the Sea and the sea was like man we cannot bear this what do you want us to do he ordered the wave to go to blessed be the name of the Lord when the world swallowed Jonah I believe maybe it was in the morning it is a good day but after some time the prophet said that when the fish eat something he go to the bottom of the SE and rest there it wants to vomit the stomach is dancing as it wants to go nothing coming amen amen what happened somebody recognized his mistake and knew that had the power of calling and I believe before Jonah started to pray well was very okay amen but when he started praying Hallelujah when the wick of the Christian KN down to pray even the case of Hell will sh when he started to pray well was disorganized when Jonah was in the boat the sea was disorganized when he was cast into the sea well was disorganized amen that's when Jonah practiced what he had not seen before that's why the prophet says God uses desperation to bring the best out of you I believe Jonah had ever read that in the scroll and did not know how it works but but when he was in the belly of the world he made a prayer he said God when Solon was dedicating the temple he saw would fall in trouble when he turn his first and look at the temple of pray you hear his prayer from Heaven he was he didn't even know that he was facing that Temple and he was praying by faith praise be to God Amen maybe well was going another Direction but after the prayer well got the compass now up to n and went toward n blessed be the name of the Lord amen Jonah saw that scripture working the Bible tells us in his name we shall cast out demons we shall lay our house the seek shall recover we shall raise the dead brother sister one of these days God will put in a stress and you will see that scripture working praise be to God [Applause] Amen my sister there I believe one of these days yes you'll have a testimony we are very sure about amen and you will stand here you will read the scriptures your own s that word will put on flesh because what has hold you up to today it is the power of the call of God in your life blessed be the name of the Lord as I'm about to finish you see the Bible says where the devil is cast out out of somebody he goes in the dry and then he comes back after some time to shake that house where he used to stay and when he find that house he goes and bring back 10 more strong demons seven more strong demons and the state of that person the Bible [Music] says it becomes worse but let me tell you Jonah had backl but he was not lost and indeed Jonah's St was seven [Music] times first of all he made the the businessmen to lose their merchadise secondly almost the ship almost wreck he was cast in the sea he was in the wh say that when Jonah was praying when all de side was V when was vomit vomit it was worst state somebody could be in but let me tell you because the goal of God was in his life regardless of that amen hallelujah the world heart bring him out Hallelujah that's why we need to be so careful many time we drift without realization the Devil comes and sleeps he brings something to you and then your heart will tremble and then you you turn even maybe your head then again tomorrow by the time you realize you already in that thing blessed be the name of the Lord but brother let me tell you you are called with a high calling and that High Calling is in Christ Jesus do not be satisfied with the things of the world let us take things above amen things on high where Christ sits on the right hand of God blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise the Lord Moses had the call of God in his life he rejected the Throne of Egypt you Pentecostal sea there is a great sea coming after me they sing just to sing the grace is coming after them they are painted with colors they in putting on there is coming after me sincerely breast show com after that is not the grace we are talking about this Grace took Jonah out of him in the right place when this Grace comes Upon Our Liv it Liv us beyond the fields of the world Amen and puts us on the highway where none can walk up there but all those who are right in the heart that's where the grace placed you he brought out of the my he plac on the Rock of Ages but he was still in the muds he said the grace coming after me you don't sing that the grace will take you out but you are contented you reached blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah we are called with a high calling blessed be the name of the Lord butam says the message of leadership that he that he rejected the throne and the popularity and could have had young girls by wives by the hundreds and he could have heard specul under why Egypt under why Egypt ruled the world the word laid right at his [Music] feet and he was ha to every bit of it but by looking in the scriptures and seeing the day he was living in and know that something in him that predestinated seed of God went to work yes sir that se in youed SE of God in you when you were in the world and you heard the world that word went work that is the power of calling and that's why you are here tonight that's why you dropped your Min that's why you drop your dreadlocks putting on suits tonight and the world is saying that you are lost indeed I'm here to inform that you are lost to the world but you are gain to the kingdom blessed be the name of the Lord the told David which Throne will you build me which house will you say heaven is my throne and the the Earth is my foot but the same God it pleased him to come and dwell in your heart that's why the world cannot understand you amen and that's why we should never we should never ever desire to live like the [Music] because we are not of the world blessed be the name of the Lord God has entrusted us with his word he has put his full word in you that you can even cast a tree and tree D you can pray for a tree and it heals you can pray for an animal it heals amen he has put that power in you blessed be the name of the Lord amen when be attacked David what resued was the power of the call of God in his life so just know when you are called by God the power of God is in your life if you go with me if you rush with me to Psalm 73 I want us to read uh just a a short verse [Music] there amen Psalms 7 3 ver 33 73 Psalms verse sir no I think I missed it missed it that's scripture where David say that I nearly my foot nearly sleep that's the same okay verse two okay read verse two but as for me and my feet my feet [Music] almost almost gone mhm my steps slipped amen how many times in your life we your nearly but God comes and CES even David had the same challenge that's why say I always put the Lord before me blessed be the name of the Lord amen so I'm here to inform you there is a power of call called by God it is a sure win that Victory is on our our God is not a loser our God is a win our God is a warrior he's a Healer he's the champion of the champion amen and the devil has a record even in Hell there's a commemoration amen where the Devil's Backbone was broke by Jesus I believe when you Fe the devil's room in hell there is a big picture on the wall where where he placed his X-ray after Jesus gave him his level amen Jesus gave the devil level and the devil knows that very well that's why the prophet says when he comes to you and he said B you make a big b amen because the backbone is not okay blessed be the name of the Lord so Brethren this is the time to realize that there is the power of the C in our life that we are called with a high calling our High Calling is in Christ Jesus amen we don't need to worry about the situations around us when we meet problems just remember I am called with high calling when sickness invade our homes we tell that we are called with when we have no job we say we are call the high calling because there is a power behind that when Moses was sent to Egypt J and jambes came to his mes blessed be the name of the Lord they never knew that behind Moses called there was a power they performed the same magic he perform hallelujah hallelujah but the man of God was not moved because thus says the Lord he was God himself God never said that I've made you a smaller God he said you are God your brother Aon is a prophet can you imagine God was standing before pharaoh and Pharaoh was seeing man and yetes was not a man praise be to God you remember when Moses went before the Lord on the mountain and the Bible say when he came to the congregation Glory sh upon until the Israelites told him to cover his because they were dying I believe if PHA was a Believer that's why when you come in the service with unbelieving heart God will touch others just see normal things someone is getting delivered you are like What's Happening Here Bo what's going on here that's why I sit behind sometimes somebody can even but brother if I was you amen I just know that the Angels come to stay on the water let me tell you Brethren my brothers and sisters when is this such a moment start warming I say God I'm here when are you touching me when are you touching me start warming I am assuring you the Holy Ghost will not will not bu pass you he will pass you away because somebody is warming praise be to God but if you're like what kind of my brother do you know that even hell is not called by the way are you seeing how deceptive denominations are hell is not cold hell is not silent I believe when they are there they even trust if they can climb and go out because and you cannot just be freezed and you like how about when the presence of God comes down one day the presence of God Came Upon Mount another time that presence of God during the time of Elijah in the shown on Mount cam when that presence came down the Bible says it even leaked the [Music] water even the stone melted what kind of heart do you have accept the presence of the holy spirit in your when that fire comes down the one who dooug the presence of God will be the one running toward the amen allow God to burn that hard shell blessed be the name of the Lord this gospel will preach like this until Jesus comes but if you not careful enough and you are taking things for granted rather you will attend church every day you will listen three sermons a week you will listen to all the messages you will stream preachers in the YouTube and still remain the same not until you accept until God blessed be the name of the Lord break my f ground break my FAL ground brother we have FAL ground in our hearts and preach the message that drawers in the door we have different compartment in our [Music] heart and he says you up to you to open to Jesus amen Jesus will knock until Rapture but on the final day will not knock he will only come and take those who are ready to go after attending church for 50 Years be careful Les you remain let us be conscious of the presence of God God want to see us active he want to see us on fire because we are small magnets and when the mighty magnet comes that's when you see commotion in the church it because the greater magnet has near and those with magnetism will start dancing they start falling and rolling not gimmick it but when it is real real something's happening in their life amen don't be plastic because magnet will never attract plastic be magnetized in prayer that's where we increase our magnetism after you have prayed up you've been having time with God then you come in such a place here Glory hallelujah amen when we come in all of us we are charged and when the Great magnet comes hallelujah hallelujah that's where you find the Saints on fire where you find them running here and there blessed be the name of the Lord that's when they realize that God indeed called them and the holy calling which God called us with the devil will never call you back no man will ever call you back because God called you he sounded for the trumpet we are moving forward and it will never sound a trumpet for retweet our God is not a god of the retweet he's a god of on the Bible says in Joshua 5 that when Moses after the death of Moses God spoke to Joshua and he told him when they reached uh he told him to to stop with the of Israelites and he commanded him to circumcise them in that place is called Gil of circumcision and the circumcision he told them to move on blessed be the name of the Lord God knew people they had no Covenant with him and they were the Young Generation who were going to possess the L God instructed J Joshua to circumcise them and for them to move forward the same God In Our Generation he knew that not make it without the Holy Ghost the same God In Our Generation he knew that without the Holy Ghost cannot make it he sent us the message with the true teaching of the Holy Ghost for us to receive the Holy Ghost and move forward and I'm here to tell you we are not of the one that draws we are moving forward because the Bible tells us the of the righteous man is like Shining Light it shine brighter every day brighter and brighter to the glory of the day God bless you amen let me run as our pastor is coming he in the race hope me all bring you this Grace but let me rise on the wings of Faith until the day the day I see your face no hold me run help me run Hallelujah are in the rain help me bring you disce bow me right slow Hallelujah on the wings of Faith until the day the day I see your face sometimes the we down here gets right oh when I look at Satan's blood is then I rise on the wings of faith for in God's wi I am SI help me ride Lord help me run oh in the rest oh help you know bring you [Music] this oh until the day I see your praise the name of the Lord amen while they prepare their offering bags thank you so much brother martin for yielding to the holy spirit amen as the Lord minister to you amen I think we need to have by m needs to preach part two The Power of responding to God's call there is power in God's call I wanted to imagine Moses the devil wanted to kill him at butes had a call of God and the devil couldn't kill him and then you know as he went to the waters as the mother put him to River Nile the devil wanted to kill him there but because of the power of God call upon his you know God instead took him to the Palace that to me I think that is incredible power over amen i i as my brother was preaching I was looking at my life I have seen the power of God is called how many have seen the the man lying at the pet years you know in that situation you know I love the way the brother said it he had become a citizen in that situation but because when Jesus came and called on him that was the end of that situation I want you to imagine that the power of 38 years now you you could have a situation maybe for a few years 38 years hear me nothing cannot change when God calls you and when you respond to the call amen something must happen praise the name of the Lord the woman at the well you know imagine she had stayed with how many husbands five 1 2 3 4 5 and by the time she met Jesus she was with a sixth but then Jesus called on her do you think she went back to that woman that man do you think she went back to that man she had found another man Jesus amen she respond to call and the Bible says she dropped her picture and she ran back to the city Hallelujah she said come see a man who has told me everything about my life isn't this the very Messiah I mean her entire life was rearranged because of the power of that call I believe Jesus is still calling [Music] today May respond to that call Amen Let us sing all over the world the spirit is moving I'm not sure if that's the key but maybe you can just follow all over the world the spirit is moving all over the world as the prophet said it to be oh love of the world there the mighty Revelation oh the glory oh the Lord as the waters cover the sea will deep down in my heart oh thy spirit is moving deep down in my heart as the prophet said it will be come on now deep down in my heart well there's a mighty revelation all the glory oh the Lord as the waters cover

amen deep down in my heart the spirit sing it with me now deep down in my heart as the prophet said it will be deep down in my heart well there a mighty Revelation oo as the waters cover the sea [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen the spirit is moving I don't know if you're seeing something but I'm seeing the spirit moving you know what we have heard today is not a words of a man I felt so strongly that brother martin needed to minister this evening myself I was a bit down in my body but I I felt a bit good today so I called him and and he said pastor if if you feeling better you can preach this evening no I still feel the leadership that you should preach he said well pray for me how many we are blessed this evening I believe that that was lead of the Lord let us give thanks to the Lord father we thank you so much for our precious brother that you have used and that he has yielded himself to be used of the Lord this evening father Lord you've given to us the Word of Life this was not a words of a man was Words of Life Lord I how I wonder how many people Lord do not respond to the call and that you would call and they don't respond and that you would call and they Remain the but Lord we have heard that Moses stood before Pharaoh Pharaoh saw a man but Lord we know that this was more than a man because he told him I'm sending you over to Egypt and he said you will be a God and Moses was God he represented you and he stood for you and he was you and when the children of Israel stood in that presence they recognized that presence but as they stood before Pharaoh Pharaoh saw a man and because he saw a man he he did not see what you were doing at that time but you were calling your children out of Egypt may we not be blinded like Pharaoh may we see what you're doing it was God speaking to us this it was not a man Lord it it was you ministering to us tonight and we receive it with all our hearts may we walk out of here today strengthened Lord powerin
