I'll tell you 13. 2 verses 18. now so I'm reading in English when Jesus came into the course of kaiseria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man arm and they said some say that thou adjoin the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah's or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art at the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed blessed at thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed eat unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that are Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will be with my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it is foreign [Music] I want to thank God for uh brother Peter who has song Ready for the first time but that was nice amen as you continue to humble yourself and heal yourself I'm sure that God will use amen we need to pray that God will keep lifting up others amen want more more give each of us want wants to be a gift in the body you know the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail that's what I'm speaking about the Gates of Hell shall not prevailing jeans no interpret what I'm saying the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail yes that's what I'm speaking about this praise God the guests over here [Music] you know especially when I look at myself many times and really for a long time ever since I got to know Jesus Christ as my personal savior you got to see how much the devil fights [Music] many forms in my own personal life and how many times the Lord has prevailed then I'm able to understand that it's not my fight I want Integrity it is this I thought I I shared I shared with you here some time back actually shall accomplish and I shared that also in a fear it was a blessing to the Saints there you know just the thought of knowing that when uh when when when God speaks his words his word shall not return unto him voice if his word goes out after it has gone out to must accomplish the purpose has been sent to us the word of man is not that way many times we give promises and break promises not because we did not want to accomplish the promises but because we are human many times times even when it comes to uh you know people you know disappoint one another way not because they wanted to disappoint one another but because they are human and they are not filled with the Holy Ghost most times [Music] you remember I always see this character Peter um Peter was a very good brother he was one of the spiritual brothers and one day he told Jesus yes look at all this one they may leave you but I will stay with us in other words they can all forsake you um those were the words of a man who actually meant to them [Music] [Music] I told you [Music] but then later on when they had captured Jesus I believe Peter was among those that was he the one who cut off that man's ears because he really was he meant what he said and then when they captured Jesus was among the ones that were shocked that they could actually capture I believe all the disciples thought that Jesus was Untouchables they could not take him they could not arrest him arrested him it was a surprise it was a big surprise to the fraternity of the believer they have arrested the Messiah imagine if you were the one at that time how would you what would you think they have called Jesus our leader yes they actually handcuffed him Mutual and so the disciples scattered including Peter intended to still keep his promise and so he was still around mm-hmm and as they took Jesus everywhere but in a distance [Music] but for me I'm here he's a Wendy but not a master sincerely realistically just to be in a distance because I don't want to be arrested foreign how can you [Music] [Music] I said feed myself and everything he prophesied you remember the first time he looked at him and he said he discerned him nobody had told Jesus Peter's name but it was by discernment he called him out by name and I want to say by this word Jesus has called you out of the World by name amen you received the revelation of the world upon that Revelation heal the church you are built there and the words of Hell cannot defeated went through a lot of sufferings [Music] amen we see here in the Book of Matthew chapter 16. and Jesus came into the course of kaiseria Philippines and he asked the disciples whom do men say that I the son of man and they said some say you were John the Baptists what about you what do you say and now Simon Peter Simone he answered and he said you are Christ great Christian foreign [Music] what is the son of a rabbit oh man I welcome you average the son of a donkey um to say that Jesus was the son of God God is a spirit John 4 24 God is a spirit and Peter said you are the Christo not a Christ see a river Christian the son of the living foreign equipment and Upon This Rock I will build my children flesh and blood has not revealed it is Jesus who what's the revelation of who Jesus is that Jesus Christ is and upon this Revelation I will build my church the Catholic church say that the the the Revelation that The Rock was Peter and and you know the the Anglican Church say that The Rock was Jesus but you see we've received the Revelation in our days hallelujah the church is built upon that rock the church is built upon that Revelation he says because of that and before I continue I want to say that church was built from the First Ages the second the third video we are right here on the last time the Church of Jesus Christ that is why I don't care what the name of the church is the center of their teachings is not the revelation of Jesus Christ [Music] it is or if it is not the original chance of Jesus Christ the name of the Lord and that church you can track it from the very beginning at the very beginning they have not been a big group every generation they've been a small group talking about from the days of the Apostles they were just around like rats trying to find where they will hide Quaker it appeared as if what they had was strange and what was their greatest enemy the religious people and what did they hate most Jesus want them to speak in the name of Jesus I didn't want them to heal people in the name of Jesus they did not want them to preach in the name of Jesus the church in the original in the first church their Foundation was the revelation of who Jesus is Jesus was not just a man knew that Jesus was God in France it is very easy for us to believe but it's very difficult for them foreign [Music] they saw everything when he went to the temple and the priest would say take the children away he was Among Us when he became 12 years he started now you know challenging the priests and they were amazed at his wisdom and his parents me and your father that was the narrative at that time that was the narrative at that time in that generation that Joseph was the father of Jesus by Mary saying that me and your father have been looking for you he denied the Virgin birth [Music] foreign because he has some little he was a threat even to the Jews themselves because the Jews they knew the prophecies he is the one coming to to uh to Deliver Us from the hands of the Romans and then it turned out that he wasn't he said my kingdom is [Applause] [Music] [Music] he was questionable foreign [Music] [Music] foreign do you personally have a revelation of this Jesus we are talking about and they all kept quieter while he was there yeah foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] was built upon the revelation you know [Music] yes it's the name of Jesus Christ [Music] and that's why the world hurts you yes whatever it is [Music] [Music] the one that puts Sweetness in the world oh yeah the one loves you oh yeah yeah because the word loves you because you are like but if you you are like Christ never finding like this Jesus is in you yes the world will automatically hate it and the disciples why why because of Jesus but the church we have today is Love by the way because the world has come into the church that's right how many believe that the preachers no longer have a backbone to say the truth the worship leaders they just do entertainment instead of worship Brothers they have teams called teams of dancers and you know they copy the stairs of the world and they bring it in the church for what purpose to attract the younger generation if the gospel we are preaching that it cannot attract the younger generation which is not worth it but they have to devise other things you find the gods and boys [Music] and they are saying they're doing it for Jesus that is not the Jesus of the Bible yes the Jesus of the Bible has another way of attracting people to himself that is according to the Bible friends those are the things that attracted the people come and see what is this all about Gucci but the world hated the decisions because of this name Jesus yes whenever they spot Jesus because the church has been built upon that Foundation am I preaching to someone phew you know and he says Flesh and Blood come on we don't say has not revealed eat unto them but my Father in Heaven Guru and Upon This Rock I will build my church so the church is built upon every generation it has been about Jesus it's all about you it's all about you but it says Hallelujah oh my even if it's only one person who will receive that Revelation oh yes oh yes and they get some hair yeah witchcraft cannot Prevail the world all the afflictions of the world come and prepare everybody [Music] Oh Glory in the Book of Psalms 34 the Bible says the Lord is unto them that are of a broken heart this is verse 18. and saveth he serves such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord hallelujah many are the afflictions of the righteous foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's not even what is exciting it is [Applause] [Music] amen the Lord doesn't deliver you from sermon [Music] but he said it delivers you from all you have sections from all your Affliction I'm going to say it until you receive this again from all your afflictions what are your afflictions Hallelujah glory to God he says he keepeth your bones not one of them is flesh is just for you know you know good looks but what does God mean it means the framework none of them is going to be disappointed Hallelujah no matter your Affliction the Lord is gonna deliver you oh let me prophesy the Lord is going to deliver me none of your afflictions you know and even if you feel like oh I'm not a child [Music] I can tell you I I believe you're a child of God you do not bring yourself you may think you are here for this for that reason God by his fullness and you would hear this message [Music] of Hell cannot prevent Hallelujah in Acts chapter 7 verse With Envy yes they moved with envy and they sold Joseph into Egypt [Music] but God was with him amen it doesn't matter it doesn't matter who disappointed it doesn't matter among your Generations you know this is what they call generational customers I don't care what they brought you to um the Bible says when Joseph was sorry you know into Egypt but God was with him if you are predestinated God is with you God is with me God is with you oh take this water Professor tonight God is with you and if God is with you what can defeat churches the Church of the Living God Jesus and deliver him because God was with him even him out of all his afflictions yeah God was with Joseph his brother sold him his family [Music] was with him and because God delivered him God delivered out of all his afflictions [Music] and gave him favor and wisdom against in the sight of pharaoh king of Egypt and he met him Governor [Music] um Joseph is our party yes we are following in the trail of Joseph if Joseph got faith and wisdom yes in the sight of pharaoh my father you are going to receive favor in the sight of your Affliction Hallelujah you are going to receive favor and wisdom I guess my good Lord [Music] preach these words get supplied on your life I mean without faith is impossible to please nothing will happen but if
