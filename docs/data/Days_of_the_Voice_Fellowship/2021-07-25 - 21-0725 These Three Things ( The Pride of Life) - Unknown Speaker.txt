on oh and we are going to to take a reading that we have been uh together is somebody to that date okay uh throughout this subject [Music] love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him seen for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the last of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but of the world and the world passes away and the last day arose but either do with the will of god abides forever let us pray our precious loving jesus we come before you this morning lord we come to you with praise we come to you with worship lord jesus and also with repentance we ask [Music] whatever it is that you are going to tell us consecrated myself and put myself aside for you to use me this morning as insufficient as i feel whoever needs to hear from you this morning before the foundation of the world and ordained them to be in these services i pray that you will help them to yield themselves that you they will hear your voice with you lord we are here in almost an empty church because of the lock down but father we know that the saints of god are gathered in their homes and others in other places where they are nature and they have come together to be able to hear your word they hear this word lord through their computers and phones and laptops i pray that lord that they will receive that conviction lord lord jesus you are not limited by distance i know you are here with me and my brother's here also you will be where they are they don't have to speak to them in their language may you bless them lord come about yourself and grant them your grace in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen so we are speaking on these three things once again this morning [Music] and uh i once again would like to request you to be very very attentive be very attentive so that you can be able to hear and not miss anything that they always have for you this morning [Music] he is this the one that has been attending our bible studies brother cello brother you can just have your hands if that's okay yeah all right yeah god bless you god bless you brother it's good to have you once again brothers over there from kenya uganda kenya amen i mean all right now this morning i just want to continue on with the subject that we have been dealing with for two weeks now and as i said i would like it to be very attractive you got so that you will be able to take out something from the service this morning pray for me and my brother henry i'm gonna be angry that the holy spirit will be able to use us to bless you and avoid movements as much as you can [Music] amen now in the first instance we dealt with the lust of the flesh why and i know i had many people who would say ah is this even also the last of the flesh even this one even that one [Music] [Music] but also do not love the things that are in the world [Music] and summarizes them in this next verse for all that is in the world the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life he says is not of the father but is of the world to be very so we notice that these things are not of the father they are not of god but they are of the world so the last of the flesh is not of god the last of the pride of the these three things are the source of your temptation yes these are the three doors the devil tempts anyone and for the last two weeks we have been looking we are there is no christianity if people have been overcome by these three things if christians get overcome by these three things there is no christianity it does not come as a devil he introduces himself and says hello i am the devil can you open for me [Music] that doesn't happen he only comes and so we already found out how we can overcome the last of the flesh and i will begin again as the past two services with this quote because really i wanted to understand this give it to me in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil our yes he overcame the personal temptations of satan by the word he overcame the personal temptations of the devil by the way and he came in everyone was achieved by the word and by the word only everyone was a chicago way that we can defeat the devil just so when i sit anymore and with the chicken only by the water and he says in each of these three major triads that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden disobedience to the world but jesus is overcame by the word hallelujah amen and right now let me say this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because it is because of these three things [Music] the world cannot fail the church can fail manny can face your parents can fail everybody will fail the bible says let every man be a liar but god be true and i tell you whatever situation it is that you are fighting against in your life [Music] i have a solution for you and that solution is right here in the word of god because that world cannot fail [Applause] is [Applause] for christian facts almost christian it is a match for a christian to sing for a christian to pray for all these things but while we are still on this world today the greatest thing that will help us is the word of god because the world is god himself it will always accomplish its purpose you are able to overcome by [Music] he as god cannot overcome with anything else but his word and that is why he is our mighty conqueror there is no prophet there is no pope no it is our lord jesus christ that is why even when it comes to water baptism we baptize in the name of our lord jesus christ because that name of the [Applause] [Music] the devil was you know capturing all the believers who were dying satanic captivity [Applause] the world and you now can overcome by the same one hallelujah can you say it on your mouth in your home amen genesis and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a pretty big desire to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did it and gave also and to her husband with her and he did it [Music] sister eve the bible says the reason why she desired the truth because of three things are you following me because of three things number one because the tree was good for food what does it mean it was appealing to her flesh [Applause] [Music] that is the last of the flesh and also the second reason was because it was pleasant to the eyes hey you know her eyes felt like am i so good oh if i can get that singing and finish if i can i i i receive that thank you it will satisfy me for our eyes what was lasting after that that is of the eyes and then the tree was to be desired to make one wise normal treat these three [Music] from she will no longer be a follower that's the reason why many young people take alcohol that's the reason why many people you know go in adultery that's the reason why people got fornication because the world makes you feel separate if you do not do what they are doing you are a fool you are foolish come on be a man take a single be a man take alcohol how can yes they advertised them to appeal to the people as though it was going to change their status you know how can you be there obviously and you can't even drive a car you are like a child come do what we did so you can drive so you can own a house so you can be a part of the bride of life [Music] i [Applause] [Music] i [Music] lovely [Music] lovely [Music] when nothing [Music] [Music] far from [Music] the sea [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] amen amen because of this message it has separated me from the [Applause] [Music] you [Applause] to seven o'clock then the devil takes him up into the holy city instead of him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give thee uh shall we give his angels church concerning thee and their hands they in and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou shalt dust thy foot against a stone jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god. foreign hallelujah amen here comes the devil again standing up for me and he comes to jesus he came to jesus three times everybody shouted and said three times if you're on youtube write it down there and say three times [Music] three times the devil came to jesus three times three times and each time he tempted him with something the first time he tempted him with the last of the flesh the bread of life and then the last of the eyes now we see come he took him to the highest spot of the city he took him to the place of the [Music] you may he suddenly also doubts [Music] in his mind in the mind of jesus [Music] and he told him let us go so jesus was tempted yes i said jesus was tempted and he went on in the devil tried to make jesus without who he was [Music] because if you [Music] [Applause] yes i am are you a son of god my sister yes you are but does that never believe it but here i am to remind you as if the true church of god shall know who she is and what she stands for she will be an invisible army amen and jesus yes right at the pinnacle of the temple and the devil said to him if thou be the son of god cast myself down where was the devil standing are you in his mind whatever by the way but now if julia i'm a son of god i can't hold that aside and i test it so that can try to throw myself down oh sorry i love it in your life when the devil comes to him standing with jesus he quotes a scripture the devil knows who you are my children but the only doubt i actually was having so when it comes to you he knows how to approach that you will give a charge of angels concerning me so if i'm a son of god but now we're not going to talk about the angels are here their hands they shall bear me upon this scripture was exciting the mind of jesus christ is the way he said the truth he said it true if i'm a child of god come on i got to wonder does that work over me i am predestinated even if i he said it is after all even in the message the prophet said that it is not you who is holding yourself is his love that is holding and he sent me in this in this message and now i'm one of his own individuals he brought me out of the marriage [Music] so even if i i go this one time [Applause] [Applause] and jesus said unto him yesterday it is written again shall we create thou shalt not take the lord thy god take him come again thou shalt not tell the lord thy god and i tell you my sister my brother might want to do with you like how we did with jesus on a pinnacle oh [Music] no we should not own this world in its presence in full conditioning is going to be hours after the kingdoms of men are destroyed when the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of our god and will become the kingdom of our god do not allow the devil give you this world around in his spiritual condition he may give you everything but he will ruin your entire life and jesus knew this whole world is his name but not in the present condition he therefore rejected the offer remember the devil wanted jesus only he will give you everything the pride of life but he wants to capture yourself as for me i say no i refuse do i have someone who will join me i refuse i refuse hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah my brother my sister even those of you who i can't see of the devil subject while i mean today i will not accept to be controlled by him i refuse i refuse the pride of life the devil can give me the whole world but i refuse hallelujah is amen you ought to find it before i say so you can be able to put it immediately brother now he says what is the holy ghost today to a human being was the holy ghost hallelujah hallelujah when he comes he comes to circumcised then stephen in the book of acts the seventh chapter when he said oh you uncircumcised in heart and ears you always do resist the holy ghost [Music] all the things of the world now somebody say all the things of the world it circumcises you away from the things of the world the love of the world it takes everything away from you the pride of life he takes all that thing away from you the devil wants you to get it but the lord takes it away from me when you receive the holy ghost there is no way you can overcome it just circumcises you from that come on you have nothing to do with it naturally it does it itself and puts you in love with jesus there is nothing can separate you from the love of god which is in christ are you hearing me now [Music] so i can show them how sexy i am the pride of life is a problem someone will tell you oh you look like [Music] and then the friends the ones you call your friends are the worldly people they will say off the ground [Music] you look like ready to be smashed by the devil that's what it means [Music] you know jesus wants to hit you who finish you and that's why it gives you that fight of life you get some little a friend will send him to you you won't want to bust the brother i want everyone to know you are the one who drives the other car you want everyone to know you own the other house [Music] these things [Music] he bought this phone and it used to be he would take his speaking phone and whenever he reaches where people are he pulls it out even if no one has called him he passes oh if god has given you natural beauty use that natural beauty to serve the lord but you find people wanting to glorify themselves even so that sin misunderstanding but they take the selfies and then what do they do they behave funny they open their mouth like this see how the blessings of god and then after that what next my brother my sister do not accept glory when it is the devil commanding you to be glorified if you don't have to push yourself on facebook so you can get married your brother your husband will come at the right time faithful wait a minute praise the name of the lord amen hallelujah there is something i want to read for you here i picked it up from a source on the internet and i thought it was quite amazing that i read it out to you because it has a lot of truth in it the pride of life can be defined as anything that is of the world [Music] the pride of life can be defined as anything that is of the world yes [Music] we see i went somewhere again one day and there is a preacher who came up on the pulpit and he was having this tight shoot on him yet and he was you know he was very tight like that and he came on the pulpit and he started talking and these were the first words which came out of his mouth [Music] he said everywhere i go god fills people with the holy ghost everywhere i go speaking after that meeting i felt sorry for the brother he came on the pulpit showing off and displaying himself he left the pulpit he's very defeated very ashamed as a matter of fact i have never been in a service where people don't like that not displaying myself [Music] let me go and show them never ah anything that makes you to have pride in itself a cheat which creator when you meet somebody even these days on our sub status what's up more younger people are posting things to pride himself [Music] you know loving myself things like that what is it it is pride of life that produces the pride of life comes from alive of the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him [Music] we've was tempted by the serpent to disobey god and eat the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil is when you have asked for permission [Music] yes that you are cutting sister so-and-so yes it is in the light the family is aware that god is aware the family remains the pastor is aware [Music] yes a few months [Applause] so believers are given an opportunity to have girlfriend boyfriend only a few months to marriage but you find younger people in the church preparing themselves desire know the which you see and then you desire to own open systems [Music] somehow perceived that the fruit would make her wise giving her wisdom beyond her own cow [Music] can you imagine you know anything that makes you feel you will change your status uh and part of saturn's life was that eating the fruit would make her like a god [Music] do you know where you will be in two years [Music] i can be bigger than i am [Applause] anything that exhausts you above your station and offers the illusion of god like of god-like qualities [Music] in arrogance and worldly wisdom acquaintances you will be someone big oh you look at all the cars they give oh yeah you look at a big saturday why do you think many people want to be mps because they look at all those things [Music] not all of them maybe some maybe want to serve humanity but very few of course and even then even them soon they are corrupted that's why the prophet tells us politics is of the devil why because it seeks to lift you from your station and offers you an illusion of god-like qualities oh and our arrogance and worldly and i found [Applause] so this one was driving a big car a huge gap and he continued to go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] even if god ever blesses you with a lot of money if a snake or something would come this way the pride of life is anything that will make you feel you are boosting yourself and in arrogance and worldly wisdom [Music] not content to live in a perfect world under his perfect grace and chaos [Music] the devil tempts us to the last of the flesh [Music] someone eats and eats but they don't even want to work [Music] excessive alcohol consumption [Music] and drugs [Music] drunkenness [Music] i'm reminding you this because this is the concluding a part of this series [Music] our [Music] the very same that resulted in suddenly did you hear that if you see the preachers and the prophet the preachers of our generation many of them have desired to be god many of them one day there is one here in kampala who was even being worshipped and they whereby you will sleep before you finish the titles they want to be very you know doctor phd phd pastor apostle [Music] [Music] was the biggest title that you could ever give him and sometimes when you call pastor brother he may not even answer he feels the believer in him [Applause] because these are the three things that overcome all the tempt the young the old the big the mighty the symbol everyone else the pride the mother will feel that the woman will and then one is better to say me you talk to me like that all your guests you talk to me like that or you're getting angry oh what is [Music] let me preach this please [Music] oh let it never enter the message his wife jesus christ is the head of us hallelujah you know the the men we are very good at reminding our wives we are the head dragons i just have to drive you everywhere you this is the same reason why there are many desires there are many stripes in in churches [Music] in churches why what is the cause [Music] because [Music] it is everywhere the whole thing is rotten oh god children with the holy ghost so that you may make us ready for your coming [Music] see it's an instrument of death shi no chap why is it to exalt yourself in direct contradiction to jesus's statements he [Music] [Music] the pride of life stands in our way whenever we try to stop the law and i'll finish with this quote from the message how the engine came to me and his commission of work brother please give it to me on the screen so that the people can follow me about you see saturn uses a man his head he chose that in the garden of eden to take a man's head to take a man is thinking the devil does not use your heart he uses your head and he has brought that down even to the church [Music] see the devil takes a man so he can use his eyes and if he will notice even the man isn't genuinely if the man isn't generally born again spiritual he will he will take what he can [Music] because man wants to do something bigger he wants to make a big name for himself this thing is even coming in a message some people wanting to be bishops over the others [Music] [Music] i always hold one thing do things tight put it into the ability support the goals that's what the message tells us but the bible and the message in the church book i didn't prepare that quote here but the prophet insists not be a gambler but every man must be led by the holy ghost even the preachers even the people the pastors control the church by the world and the holy ghost [Music] not by their own ideas in the same [Applause] where god leads you you are free to move you're free to go but i want you to see this even the denominations they started small when becoming big and big and full [Applause] to even see this man of god you need to build your money you need to make an appointment [Music] until the man of god but i thank god that this message can never be a denomination okay let's read on here he wants to be religious [Music] what good does it do but he thinks he's achieving something because he's adding more now i never had to come and then he says i believe it was some years ago in 1944 that the baptist had a slogan out a million more in 44. iran [Music] if they wasn't genuine born again disciples of christ they were just baptist by names look at the other denominations there was material the pentecostals all the other denominations they are the same they are trying to achieve something they want to do something great because it is his eyes he is looking at he's looking at what his eyes are saying he thinks with his eyes and many times he doesn't understand that that's the thing that he ought to not do [Music] but the devil takes the man his eye he shows him something pretty he opens his eyes to look at it and he's got that into the church [Music] and this message i was reading is from the unity of one god in one church and here's what i wanted to say in many churches today but we thank god for this message it's not about how many people we are now it's about how many souls are ready in this message of god it will be the same way our purpose is for us to find the last one but what do we have in the generation the pride of life oh [Music] our drive is to find the last source must have that burden to find that last shot and i finished with this quote as i promised how the angel came to me and his commission that's a very short quote he says just like a preacher a good faceful preacher try to make some big prestige or a big name for some church or a big name for himself friends we are not preaching this message because we are seeking a big name but why is it this way never actually it's the pride of life taking over and then he says i would rather have two or three nice meetings and praise on someone somewhere else and be humble again for money request for all nations i think it's christ for all nations she was money from brothers and others but he says i would rather preach a small meeting and be humble and straight down and you know what i mean yes sir always keep your place [Applause] out until i am blessed already indeed they are blessed already and their blessing is remaining here as for me and all those on their way to heaven we still need more blessings we still need to be blessed to be able to make it for heaven someday and we know we will make it amen amen i know i will make it you will make it my brother you will make it my sister as long as you stay in your flesh where god can find it where you can overcome the pride of life where you can say no nothing between two workers [Music] jesus hold [Music] [Music] you can't walk without him [Music] it's [Music] for that [Music] as i travel through this pilgrimage safely through the sinking side it is [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] let me travel [Music] songs [Music] [Music] [Music] through this big [Music] me [Music] jesus i hope to meet you there [Music] jesus [Applause] [Music] me [Music] i hope to meet you there jesus hold my hand for right [Music] [Music] me [Music] oh my sister and brother [Music] oh [Music] come on praise him [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] oh [Music] my sister [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh
