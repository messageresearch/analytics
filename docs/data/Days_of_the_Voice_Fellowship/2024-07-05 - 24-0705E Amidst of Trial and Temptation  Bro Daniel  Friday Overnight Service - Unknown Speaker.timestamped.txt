[57:04] Christ
[57:07] amen God bless you you can
[57:11] sit yeah this
[57:13] evening I really have a short
[57:16] message for
[57:19] us it has really been corresponding with
[57:22] the situation I've been in through this
[57:24] week
[57:26] and when Brother Martin was singing here
[57:29] it was again becoming more corresponding
[57:33] with with the message that I want to
[57:36] speak about this evening amen the
[57:39] message today it will be Aid this the
[57:42] trial and
[57:47] temptation as we read in the
[57:51] scriptures uh here in Matthew
[57:54] chapter 18 verse 9 he said if thine eye
[58:00] offend thee black it out and cast it out
[58:03] from thee it is better for thee to enter
[58:06] into life with one eye rather than
[58:10] having two eyes to be cast into Hell
[58:15] Fire so it means when when when we read
[58:19] this scripture it means there some there
[58:21] are some things that will offend us that
[58:24] will offend our eyes that will offend
[58:27] not even our eyes only but other things
[58:30] our eyes is just standing for sensitive
[58:33] things in our
[58:35] lives there are very many sensitive
[58:37] things in our lives that we look
[58:40] at our our
[58:42] living um our
[58:45] families our church all the things that
[58:48] are really so close to us the eyes just
[58:53] standing for that but the the Bible is
[58:56] saying if that thing will will will make
[59:01] let me read
[59:05] again and if thine eye offend thee black
[59:08] it out it means that some things that
[59:11] are some sensitive things in life that
[59:14] you look at but when you see they're
[59:16] going to offend you or or remove or or
[59:20] remove you in the presence of the Lord
[59:22] you better cut out that thing
[59:26] it may be so sensitive may be so
[59:31] big but the Bible is saying if your eye
[59:34] is going to offend you pluck it
[59:38] out so it is really a hard moment when
[59:43] such a situation comes in
[59:46] life but God gives us Grace amen is only
[59:51] God's grace that keeps us moving amid
[59:54] such things
[59:57] here when we we we try to look at the
[1:00:00] difference between a a trial and a
[1:00:04] Temptation here trial
[1:00:06] is a trial is something that you are
[1:00:10] meant to
[1:00:11] overcome to succeed against the goal of
[1:00:15] a trial is to help us grow stronger and
[1:00:19] closer to our
[1:00:22] values then a Temptation a temptation is
[1:00:26] something that you are made to fail the
[1:00:29] difference in the intention of the
[1:00:32] source the difference is in the
[1:00:34] intention of the source the difference
[1:00:36] between a trial and a
[1:00:40] temptation is between the intention of
[1:00:42] the
[1:00:43] source but the Bible tells
[1:00:46] us that God does not tempt
[1:00:49] us so who tempts us the devil is
[1:00:53] tempting us and here the Bible is saying
[1:00:57] a temptation is something that you are
[1:00:59] remain to fail the devil has never
[1:01:02] wanted you to succeed in anything the
[1:01:04] devil has never been uh in support of
[1:01:07] you every time the devil is fighting Us
[1:01:10] in all corners of our lives in
[1:01:12] everything we do in our lives the devil
[1:01:15] is always fighting us but the trials
[1:01:18] that come to our lives it may it may be
[1:01:21] the same thing that the devil will use
[1:01:24] and God will use it it may may be a
[1:01:26] sickness that will come to
[1:01:28] you sometimes we may think ah why did
[1:01:33] this
[1:01:34] come but
[1:01:36] that it may be at at the same time it is
[1:01:40] a Temptation the devil is trying to make
[1:01:43] you sick that you can
[1:01:46] die but the
[1:01:47] Lord wants to manifest himself through
[1:01:51] that sickness Amen to show you that he
[1:01:54] can heal if there was no sickness there
[1:01:57] was not going to be a Healer and a
[1:02:00] Healer is only
[1:02:03] God so everything happens for good to
[1:02:06] those that love God sometimes you go
[1:02:09] through some difficult things that
[1:02:12] really no one can
[1:02:15] understand no one can explain at times
[1:02:18] you look at a
[1:02:20] person but you don't know what they're
[1:02:22] going
[1:02:24] through but it's only
[1:02:26] God who knows why that is happening we
[1:02:31] remember Jesus Christ when he was taken
[1:02:32] to the top of the temple he was told to
[1:02:37] to fall from to fall from the from the
[1:02:40] top of the temple to up to fall
[1:02:43] down to take the seat to be the king he
[1:02:47] was
[1:02:49] hungry and he was sold to change bread
[1:02:51] into he was sold to change Stone into
[1:02:54] bread that is the circumstance that
[1:02:57] everyone is saying you say I'm hungry
[1:03:00] and I really need something to eat it is
[1:03:03] what is happening to us even right
[1:03:05] now at times you're
[1:03:08] tempted the Devil comes in a
[1:03:12] way through that need that you want he
[1:03:15] comes through he comes behind that you
[1:03:19] may be lacking something to
[1:03:21] eat and through that he's going to bring
[1:03:24] another thing that will make is going to
[1:03:26] make your way to eat you may say you may
[1:03:31] steal so through that through that
[1:03:36] Temptation you may find yourself
[1:03:40] falling but everything happens for
[1:03:44] good when you lack something to
[1:03:48] eat you you run to the Lord if you're
[1:03:53] right with him you really going to run
[1:03:56] to him for help but the devil brings
[1:03:59] that so that he can fail us so that he
[1:04:02] can really compromise with our faith but
[1:04:06] he's only standing standing with the
[1:04:08] word am because here the Bible says the
[1:04:12] youth will fail we know the youth are
[1:04:14] the most the strongest when a person is
[1:04:17] in his youthful stage he feels energetic
[1:04:21] he can do
[1:04:23] anything but here the Bible is saying
[1:04:25] that going to
[1:04:27] fail you'll work and to day and night
[1:04:31] you're going to fail but until you wait
[1:04:34] upon the
[1:04:37] Lord because look at the birds look at
[1:04:41] uh different things uh in the in our
[1:04:45] universe who feeds the
[1:04:50] birds think about
[1:04:55] you look at even wild
[1:04:59] animals they they get sick and get
[1:05:02] healed who heals them sometimes it's not
[1:05:05] the game Rangers who go there and and
[1:05:08] and try to give them
[1:05:11] medication but is the creator
[1:05:14] Hallelujah is only the
[1:05:17] Creator that is responsible of Our Lives
[1:05:22] am so through the trials and The
[1:05:27] Temptations really that is a moment that
[1:05:30] fixes someone to a point where you can
[1:05:34] even not
[1:05:35] breathe you're lacking
[1:05:38] something you're thinking here and there
[1:05:40] to see a solution out but things are not
[1:05:46] meeting but it is only waiting upon the
[1:05:49] Lord calling upon the
[1:05:53] Lord we look at very many examples in
[1:05:56] the Bible everything happens for good to
[1:06:00] those that love God look at
[1:06:03] job job he was rich he was he had
[1:06:08] everything and the devil came to
[1:06:11] God and the devil told God that ah your
[1:06:15] servant is well he is Rich he has
[1:06:17] everything but God said you go you go
[1:06:22] and and and try him you go and tempt but
[1:06:25] do not don't touch his
[1:06:27] life sometimes those things that come to
[1:06:29] our lives are not coming to to destroy
[1:06:34] us but really bring out the strength of
[1:06:37] God hallelujah really bring out to see
[1:06:41] the behind part the the strength of God
[1:06:44] everything that we
[1:06:48] see it has a reason to why it is
[1:06:54] happening you canot don't know how how
[1:07:00] hunger that's before you get hungry or
[1:07:02] before you lack
[1:07:07] food but when you lack food it's when
[1:07:10] you know the importance of that
[1:07:12] food and when you're hungry but you want
[1:07:15] to
[1:07:16] eat so that is that is the the the the
[1:07:21] the Temptation the the trials that come
[1:07:23] to our lives
[1:07:26] don't we we we everyone here has a lot
[1:07:29] of Trials has a lot of things that are
[1:07:32] going through their lives everyone at
[1:07:35] each level even a young child you will
[1:07:38] be complaining he says Ah these books
[1:07:40] are disturbing me the things but you as
[1:07:43] a old person you'll say ah this kid is
[1:07:46] just here
[1:07:48] joking but at at the level of that
[1:07:53] child it is the level of the temptation
[1:07:56] all the the level of the
[1:07:59] try now like right now the the our
[1:08:04] parents you'll find him crying asking my
[1:08:07] children have no school fees have no
[1:08:10] this and this but for us we shall not
[1:08:13] understand them because we do not
[1:08:14] experience them but the moment you go
[1:08:17] through them it's when you you'll feel
[1:08:20] the burden of that
[1:08:22] thing but God tells us carry your
[1:08:25] burdens and bring them to him he will
[1:08:29] give us
[1:08:30] rest it is you carrying them you carry
[1:08:34] your burdens and take them to
[1:08:37] God yeah here also see
[1:08:42] Hanah at times things happen and you ask
[1:08:45] yourself why is this
[1:08:47] happening why is this
[1:08:51] happening you find a righteous
[1:08:54] person there some examples in church you
[1:08:56] may look at and say ah but why is this
[1:08:59] happening to this
[1:09:01] brother why is it happening to this
[1:09:04] sister and yet they are good Brothers
[1:09:07] good
[1:09:08] sisters but it is the will of God it is
[1:09:12] the will of God he has something he
[1:09:14] wants
[1:09:15] to you to
[1:09:18] understand as you see the Bible God set
[1:09:21] us examples very many
[1:09:23] examples I think no one when we reach to
[1:09:26] Heaven even on the Judgment Day no one
[1:09:29] will say ah I failed this because of
[1:09:33] this and
[1:09:34] this they will bring another human being
[1:09:37] who went through the same thing even
[1:09:39] more tougher than yours as an
[1:09:43] example to you to they will say was this
[1:09:46] one an angel or a
[1:09:51] God so that is the purpose of the triy
[1:09:54] when you the in the am this am this like
[1:09:58] we are here in the church we are in the
[1:10:00] church now think about when you on the
[1:10:03] trial amid that trial some sometimes we
[1:10:06] just think about it
[1:10:10] say I like like now the students you may
[1:10:14] say ah I have a paper next
[1:10:17] week you don't feel the pressure until
[1:10:20] that day until that day comes it's when
[1:10:24] you'll feel
[1:10:26] how how the how pressure is so that's
[1:10:30] the trial but what are you going to do
[1:10:33] am that
[1:10:36] trial what are you going to do when
[1:10:39] you're in that
[1:10:40] trial here brother Bram tells
[1:10:43] us in a message Israel and the church
[1:10:48] When Trials around you gather breathe
[1:10:52] that holy name in prayer
[1:10:55] Devils will scatter
[1:10:58] like
[1:10:59] rles on a flow from the lights from the
[1:11:04] light is turned
[1:11:07] on breathe that name in
[1:11:12] prayer Pray even if you don't feel
[1:11:15] it
[1:11:17] pray because prayer it is the only
[1:11:20] weapon that we have that God gave us but
[1:11:23] we do not use that weapon
[1:11:26] we claim to be soldiers of the
[1:11:29] Cross but when we are told to go to the
[1:11:32] battlefield then you say ah for me I
[1:11:35] will not manage yet you call yourself a
[1:11:38] a soldier of the
[1:11:41] Cross so in those trials in it's when
[1:11:45] you you really face the real
[1:11:49] thing sometimes we just talk about
[1:11:52] them sometimes we just talk when someone
[1:11:55] says Ah I lost my dad I lost my mom you
[1:11:58] may not feel it but the time you you go
[1:12:01] through it it's when you will feel the
[1:12:04] burden but what do you do what do you do
[1:12:08] in that
[1:12:10] circumstance is only leaning upon God
[1:12:14] Hallelujah the devil has tried so
[1:12:17] much but when we stand on the
[1:12:21] Lord I know you will not forsake us we
[1:12:25] see a lot of
[1:12:27] examples sadrach M and is the
[1:12:32] fire when they were told you going to be
[1:12:35] burned the most part I like about that
[1:12:38] verse is saying if God has not come to
[1:12:42] save
[1:12:44] us let me
[1:12:46] die we shall
[1:12:49] die what brings that in our
[1:12:53] hearts being con
[1:12:56] conviced and
[1:13:00] concerned you have to be conviced and
[1:13:02] concerned of what you're holding it's
[1:13:05] why you're going to get the Zeal of
[1:13:08] pressing
[1:13:09] on you cannot press on for something
[1:13:12] that will has no
[1:13:14] value it can never
[1:13:17] happen can you press on for AA without
[1:13:19] anything just a black Vera there but if
[1:13:23] there's something so precious
[1:13:25] you're going to even fall down and stand
[1:13:28] and do everything that you can take that
[1:13:30] thing if you to take
[1:13:32] it if there's a million dollar like a
[1:13:37] like 1 million like ugan
[1:13:42] Shillings you'll Fight Hard see we have
[1:13:46] been there to the store of loading some
[1:13:50] books I was looking at men of loading
[1:13:53] books because of money
[1:13:57] the exchange of that the thing that
[1:13:59] you're going You're exchanging your
[1:14:02] energy with the money
[1:14:05] because the they
[1:14:08] correspond do you think
[1:14:11] God being born of a
[1:14:14] human do you think he just he wanted to
[1:14:17] be in that scheme of coming to die and
[1:14:23] suffer there's something
[1:14:26] precious that he was trying to redeem
[1:14:30] Hallelujah something precious you may
[1:14:33] not understand how precious you are to
[1:14:35] God right
[1:14:37] now you may not see it right
[1:14:41] now but when you
[1:14:45] pressing the bible promises
[1:14:49] us there's a law that God has prepared
[1:14:52] for us that our eyes have not seen our
[1:14:55] ears have not
[1:14:59] heard the trials will go
[1:15:02] through sometimes are very
[1:15:06] heavy but think
[1:15:08] of of what you fighting
[1:15:13] for what convinced you really to to
[1:15:17] follow this this path there's something
[1:15:20] you ought to fight
[1:15:22] for there's something everyone also
[1:15:25] fight
[1:15:26] for we see Joshua when God told them
[1:15:30] that you're going to take this
[1:15:34] land they fought for each step that they
[1:15:37] are going to take that's when you you
[1:15:40] know the value of what you're fighting
[1:15:42] for that's when you'll see your trial
[1:15:47] and tempation as something so small to
[1:15:51] what you're looking at you have to be
[1:15:54] convinced and concerned of your
[1:15:58] destination we're not just here to live
[1:16:01] and
[1:16:04] die but there's something that we we we
[1:16:07] are looking at right
[1:16:11] now but that
[1:16:13] thing you just have to be convinced what
[1:16:17] convinced you to be a
[1:16:20] Christian what convinced you to go
[1:16:23] through all these trials
[1:16:26] because
[1:16:27] here the Bible says in
[1:16:35] uh here in uh Peter
[1:17:05] the Bible tells us in First
[1:17:08] Peter 1 verse 6-
[1:17:11] 9 we can read there
[1:17:27] 1 Peter chapter
[1:17:29] 1
[1:17:31] verse verse
[1:17:33] 6 it
[1:17:37] says wherein thy greatly Rejoice though
[1:17:42] now for a
[1:17:43] season if need be you are in heaviness
[1:17:49] through manold
[1:17:52] Temptations the try that that that the
[1:17:55] trial of your faith being much more
[1:18:00] precious than gold that perishes amen
[1:18:04] though it be tried with fire may it be
[1:18:08] founded on
[1:18:10] two May might be might be found onto
[1:18:14] praise and honor and glory to the
[1:18:17] appearing of Jesus
[1:18:19] Christ whom having not seen ye love in
[1:18:24] whom
[1:18:25] whom though now you see him not he
[1:18:29] believe him you rejoice with joy
[1:18:33] unspeakable and full of
[1:18:37] Glory our faith is tried more than the
[1:18:41] gold tried in
[1:18:45] fire how many have ever been burnt like
[1:18:48] burnt with
[1:18:50] fire I think everyone knows the pain
[1:18:53] when fire burns
[1:18:57] you now the Bible is telling us our
[1:19:01] faith is more precious than gold tried
[1:19:03] in
[1:19:05] fire so why aren't you
[1:19:10] concerned of what you you looking at of
[1:19:13] what you you're Desiring of what is
[1:19:16] bringing you always
[1:19:18] here we should always be
[1:19:22] concerned we not just here
[1:19:25] just in a
[1:19:27] honeymoon or in just wasting time
[1:19:32] here think of your precious
[1:19:37] time the Bible says in
[1:19:40] Revelations that in the last days in
[1:19:43] this laian
[1:19:44] age that we are we are hot and
[1:19:48] cold why waste your time brother Bram

[1:20:05] best do everything for me I I at times I
[1:20:08] look at things I say if I was going to
[1:20:11] do that thing I'll do it with passion

[1:20:45] sinner do
[1:20:47] it do it the
[1:20:51] best not just being there because you
[1:20:54] all you're going to waste your time
[1:20:56] because you're not going to enjoy the
[1:20:59] side very
[1:21:01] well and yet you're going again to

[1:23:14] fight even the kingdom of
[1:23:18] God it is not a walk
[1:23:22] over it is not a walk over
[1:23:26] we look at
[1:23:29] people that lost their
[1:23:34] lives at times we sing here songs
[1:23:37] without knowing the meanings of them a
[1:23:41] plag Allegiance those people were
[1:23:44] just like making a no like you you in
[1:23:49] the court
[1:23:50] and you you you're making a no you're
[1:23:53] saying I this and this and this those
[1:23:56] people we are making it I pledge
[1:24:00] allegiancy
[1:24:07] amen when I think of that I really
[1:24:10] feel we need to fight for what we we we
[1:24:13] are looking
[1:24:14] at we need to press soon I this
[1:24:21] everything if it is to serve god let's
[1:24:24] Ser God with all our
[1:24:26] hearts at times the Devil
[1:24:29] Comes
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:32] really coming to distract us
[1:24:36] fully but it's only the grace of God
[1:24:39] that he promised us that he will always
[1:24:41] give us a MST every Temptation and trial
[1:24:44] that we shall overcome it is not by our
[1:24:46] Mighty is not that we have a lot of
[1:24:51] tactics that we know a lot of tax
[1:24:54] tactics of fighting the
[1:24:55] devil but is the grace of God am that he
[1:24:59] has always given us amen look at job's
[1:25:03] story when I I was reading this job's
[1:25:06] story it was really hard it was really
[1:25:09] hard for
[1:25:10] job job had
[1:25:15] everything he had
[1:25:19] everything but the devil came and took
[1:25:22] almost everything they children his
[1:25:26] livestock his
[1:25:29] everything and we're also going through
[1:25:32] some things at times we lose out the big
[1:25:35] the things that we at times like jobs
[1:25:37] you will go to a job and the job will
[1:25:40] make you compromise with God but you'll
[1:25:43] just leave it you leave the money is a
[1:25:47] painful thing for everyone because we
[1:25:50] need the
[1:25:52] money but what makes you leave
[1:25:56] it it means there's something worth
[1:26:01] it look at
[1:26:04] Job his wife came and told him can't you
[1:26:08] cast God and
[1:26:10] die and job asked the wife why why do
[1:26:13] you talk like a
[1:26:16] fool because he knew what he was holding
[1:26:19] knowing what you're holding amidst the
[1:26:22] Temptation it will make it so little for
[1:26:25] you to go through because you know what
[1:26:28] you're
[1:26:31] holding you know what you're
[1:26:35] holding even in life we have losers in
[1:26:40] life that will make you demoralize will
[1:26:44] try to bring the the negative
[1:26:48] side looking at your situation they'll
[1:26:51] see H you're a failure you this and
[1:26:58] this there were three men who came to
[1:27:00] job giving him advice do this and this
[1:27:05] so job when he started thinking about it
[1:27:08] he saw things were really
[1:27:11] tough and he started complaining to God
[1:27:15] say why this why this and this because
[1:27:18] of the people that we listen to in some
[1:27:21] of the things we go through
[1:27:25] find ourselves going astray job went
[1:27:30] astray and sometimes you also go
[1:27:33] astray because of the people because of
[1:27:36] the words of people you'll do something
[1:27:39] because of peer pressure say ah someone
[1:27:42] is looking at me someone will say this
[1:27:45] and
[1:27:47] this but job went
[1:27:52] astray but there was young
[1:27:55] man called
[1:27:58] elu when he came to
[1:28:01] job he found those men
[1:28:05] there there he said you may be old in
[1:28:12] age but I've come to tell you this and
[1:28:16] this he rebuked them of what they were
[1:28:18] telling
[1:28:22] job El in the uh
[1:28:24] the Bible means a representative of God
[1:28:30] am the representative of God is the holy
[1:28:34] spirit his
[1:28:37] word it will represent him in all our
[1:28:41] situations all that we go through El who
[1:28:45] stood and when he was
[1:28:50] speaking job CAU the Revelation CAU a
[1:28:53] vision
[1:28:54] he said I know my redeemer liveth
[1:28:58] Hallelujah when those people come to
[1:29:00] discourage you our friends discourage
[1:29:03] us they look at us and
[1:29:09] say you cannot do this and
[1:29:13] this but just tell them I know my
[1:29:15] redeemer
[1:29:20] liveth that's what helped job
[1:29:24] and repented to
[1:29:26] God so it does
[1:29:29] not even it gives us an
[1:29:33] example even the ones that you see as
[1:29:36] strong the strong Christians they also
[1:29:39] cry they also feel the pain even Jesus
[1:29:43] Christ
[1:29:45] cried the pain was too much even the
[1:29:48] things we are going through they bring
[1:29:50] that pain and
[1:30:11] if you decide to take one path if
[1:30:14] something becomes more valuable to you
[1:30:17] it may either bring life or
[1:30:21] death to you
[1:30:24] that's what we are all about in life
[1:30:27] here so at times tell the devil that is
[1:30:30] not th but tell him that is not my
[1:30:35] portion through that that's how we keep
[1:30:38] on overcoming day by day day by day you
[1:30:41] you come and you meet something so so
[1:30:45] big but you go through it even tomorrow
[1:30:48] like that in job 14:1 it says a man born
[1:30:53] of a human is a few days and full of
[1:30:57] trouble so you cannot avoid the troubles
[1:31:00] in life but what do you do do you just
[1:31:04] obey
[1:31:05] them but we have a
[1:31:08] redeemer Jesus
[1:31:12] Christ even when things are so
[1:31:17] tough for times I reach at a
[1:31:20] point where I feel like let let me let
[1:31:24] me let me just leave everything
[1:31:27] to because I my heart always tells me
[1:31:31] that there's God who can redeem you who
[1:31:34] can help you I just hold on that even if
[1:31:37] I I I don't see any result I hold on
[1:31:40] that I find myself going through
[1:31:42] that and again something else comes
[1:31:45] again you hold on that you hold on that
[1:31:48] you find yourself going through
[1:31:54] but what brings that being co convinced
[1:31:57] and
[1:32:00] concerned it's what helps us to really
[1:32:04] keep on moving convin about your
[1:32:07] destination and concerned where am I
[1:32:10] going the only two places that we are
[1:32:13] going to after here is hell and
[1:32:17] heaven so you have to be concerned where
[1:32:19] am I
[1:32:21] going but you you are you you are you do
[1:32:24] your
[1:32:25] Deeds the ones that will really bring
[1:32:28] out what you where you will
[1:32:33] go let's read this
[1:32:50] quote here brother Bram says and uh
[1:32:53] Redemption by
[1:32:56] judgment then brother something is going
[1:32:59] on is going to take place CU you have
[1:33:02] got a real foundation for God will not
[1:33:06] wise cast you out Temptations come there
[1:33:10] will never be a Temptation
[1:33:12] unless unless he gives you Grace to Bear
[1:33:17] it amen and he his promised to meet you
[1:33:22] on every
[1:33:24] Battlefront right there and stand in
[1:33:27] your place so then that's where your
[1:33:30] hope is at is
[1:33:33] at you get to the place you say well
[1:33:38] brother Bill they I have so many
[1:33:42] Temptations tell me one Christian that
[1:33:45] does not have
[1:33:46] Temptation we never come to a
[1:33:50] picnic we we we've come to a Battle
[1:33:55] Ground we are out here to fight the
[1:33:59] enemy why sure we do not put on our
[1:34:04] armor just to be looked at if you become
[1:34:07] a Christian just to be looked at then
[1:34:10] you are yeah why am I afraid you got in
[1:34:15] the wrong
[1:34:16] place Christian sometimes is looked down
[1:34:21] upon or made fun of
[1:34:25] but we come as Warrior
[1:34:27] amen and sprinkled in the blood the old
[1:34:32] ragged cross going before us the Morning
[1:34:36] Star lighting up the way why we are on
[1:34:39] our road on our road
[1:34:46] somewhere every Christian you look at
[1:34:49] our pastor our deacons our
[1:34:55] trustees our elders
[1:34:57] here all go through
[1:35:02] Temptations everyone here goes through
[1:35:08] Temptations but then through that
[1:35:12] Temptation you will decide where to
[1:35:17] go what is in
[1:35:20] you will take one side
[1:35:25] so we should always pray God to help us
[1:35:28] make a
[1:35:29] stand amidst
[1:35:31] everything you you
[1:35:36] press everything comes with a
[1:35:40] Temptation comes with a
[1:35:42] trial love comes with a trial faith
[1:35:46] comes with a trial Our Hope comes with a
[1:35:50] trial everything comes with a trial
[1:35:55] but it is you to make out something good
[1:35:57] through
[1:36:00] that because Trials come to as we read
[1:36:04] the purpose of
[1:36:05] a the purpose of a trial the trial the
[1:36:10] goal of a trial is to help us grow
[1:36:13] strong and close to our values what is
[1:36:15] your value that is what will make you
[1:36:18] grow stronger to eat even amid is
[1:36:21] everything amid is the opposition
[1:36:25] what is your
[1:36:32] values at times we have to do all we can
[1:36:36] to flee everything every
[1:36:39] Temptation every everything we have like
[1:36:42] Joseph when faroh's wife came to
[1:36:48] him Joseph do you know what he did if
[1:36:53] Leah way sometimes you have to run for
[1:36:56] your
[1:36:57] life you have to run to to do an action
[1:37:01] is not just speaking words to do some
[1:37:04] actions about the
[1:37:08] evil as you have had here if your eye
[1:37:10] makes you offending remove it if you you
[1:37:15] look at something so obscene turn your
[1:37:18] head until you reach where you're going
[1:37:20] don't look back on it
[1:37:24] at times you have to run for your
[1:37:27] life Joseph rain you also have to run
[1:37:31] all those are examples no one will give
[1:37:33] an excuse in
[1:37:37] heaven no one people have done a lot to
[1:37:40] to really see they can make that
[1:37:43] destination making their calling
[1:37:46] sure they done everything people do you
[1:37:49] not risking yourself
[1:37:53] they they're telling you they're going
[1:37:55] to to put you in fire they're going to
[1:37:57] throw in the den of
[1:37:59] lions
[1:38:02] ah then you you put on a test you
[1:38:06] say something
[1:38:09] heavy but in everything you have to know
[1:38:13] your values to know
[1:38:16] everything hallelujah
[1:38:20] amen we should always know where we are
[1:38:23] falling
[1:38:25] Joseph had to run
[1:38:30] away we should also
[1:38:32] run sometimes you have to really run
[1:38:38] run sometimes you have to behave crazy
[1:38:41] even to the world they will say this man
[1:38:44] maybe he has something he has a
[1:38:50] problem some things we take them lightly
[1:38:56] and by the time you understand
[1:38:59] ah you cannot even overcome
[1:39:03] it if Joseph had remained
[1:39:08] there maybe he would
[1:39:11] sin our bodies are not changed our
[1:39:16] bodies are not baptized with the Holy
[1:39:18] Spirit our bodies are still tempted even
[1:39:21] up to
[1:39:22] now our our bodies get
[1:39:25] angry our bodies even we get angry about
[1:39:30] people but what does the Bible
[1:39:34] say I is all those things you may have a
[1:39:37] lot of reasons to to satisfy what you're
[1:39:40] going
[1:39:40] through but what does the word of God
[1:39:43] say amid is that trial amid is that
[1:39:47] thing that is very heavy for you
[1:39:53] you just have to know the values of what
[1:39:56] you you're fighting
[1:39:58] for just have to keep racing
[1:40:01] on amid is everything you have to press
[1:40:06] on because trials groom out a
[1:40:10] character that's why you see you
[1:40:12] sometimes you look at people like Let me
[1:40:15] Give an example like is not good
[1:40:17] everyone to grow up poor but some poor
[1:40:21] people most of them
[1:40:24] they're
[1:40:26] different you know why they go through a
[1:40:28] lot they will respect people because
[1:40:31] they know if you don't respect someone
[1:40:34] you may not get something you'll know
[1:40:36] the value of that
[1:40:40] thing but is not the guarantee that
[1:40:43] every poor person is is a has a good
[1:40:48] character but some
[1:40:51] things tough things come to our lives
[1:40:55] just bring out
[1:40:57] that good thing in you because you'll
[1:41:01] not know it before you go through
[1:41:05] it that's why I have given an example
[1:41:07] poor
[1:41:10] people most of
[1:41:13] them are well behaved because they
[1:41:17] know they value
[1:41:21] things if this food are going to Value
[1:41:23] it if it is money they're going to Value
[1:41:26] it because they know they sweated for it
[1:41:29] like that young man who was the dad told
[1:41:34] him I don't remember well the story but
[1:41:38] when the dad told him to he was going to
[1:41:41] work to get some money he told him to
[1:41:44] bring money he used to then the mom used
[1:41:47] to give him money and Rings to the dad
[1:41:49] and the dad will throw it in
[1:41:51] Fire and again the the boy goes back he
[1:41:55] says go and and do this then the boy
[1:41:58] again goes and to the mom he says oh you
[1:42:00] get some money from somewhere he again
[1:42:03] brings it to the dad the Dad throws it
[1:42:05] again in the fire but when he went and
[1:42:08] worked for the
[1:42:09] money
[1:42:11] H when the dad was about to throw the
[1:42:14] money in the fire the boy jumped save
[1:42:17] his money because he knows the value of
[1:42:20] that
[1:42:24] so we should we should not just live a
[1:42:26] life live and die you know your value
[1:42:30] you know what you're looking for you
[1:42:32] know what we were created
[1:42:35] for even am this great trials a it's
[1:42:39] everything we should have to make a
[1:42:44] stand you cannot stop birds from coming
[1:42:47] to a
[1:42:48] tree but you can stop them from building
[1:42:51] a nest there
[1:42:55] trials will always come that is that you
[1:43:00] cannot remove
[1:43:03] that but if you leave them to build a
[1:43:07] nest there they will become something
[1:43:10] heavy for you but even when they come
[1:43:14] see something good through them see some
[1:43:17] life through
[1:43:19] them Hallelujah
[1:43:36] here as we read about
[1:43:39] El when he came to job here brother Bram
[1:43:42] says in a message Israel and the
[1:43:46] church so in the
[1:43:49] distress a righteous man go dealing with
[1:43:52] a sa he sent a man by the name of
[1:43:56] elu and
[1:43:58] elu did not accuse him only over
[1:44:03] choosing God but El told him said now
[1:44:08] job you have watched all these things he
[1:44:11] said now there is there is coming a just
[1:44:14] one who is going to stand in the Bleach
[1:44:18] between a sinful man and a holy God and
[1:44:22] then that man that they will go to the
[1:44:26] Grave to M
[1:44:27] for and you you you you perceive you
[1:44:31] perceive it not then will he rise then
[1:44:35] when job heard that he stood on his
[1:44:39] feet my the lightning flashed the
[1:44:43] Thunders rolled what was it the prophet
[1:44:46] got back into the channel of God again
[1:44:49] by his
[1:44:50] eyes by by by his eyes
[1:44:53] come open he said I know my redeemer
[1:44:58] liveth when we are going through hard
[1:45:01] hard things when you see even a brother
[1:45:03] going through some hard things try to
[1:45:05] confort
[1:45:06] them at times they may they may not be
[1:45:10] that good through the
[1:45:13] trials but confort them don't rebuke
[1:45:17] them so much at times you may think
[1:45:19] someone is going through something
[1:45:21] because maybe he's a sinner times those
[1:45:23] things just come to prove that God is
[1:45:26] our provider God is our everything in
[1:45:29] all the situation we are going through
[1:45:31] but at times when we look at people
[1:45:32] going through some difficult situations
[1:45:34] you say that person is a sinner that's
[1:45:36] why God is punishing
[1:45:38] him instead of conforting a brother
[1:45:42] confort a sister don't always rebuke
[1:45:45] them at
[1:45:47] times confort them and say no don't look
[1:45:51] at yourself sometimes you they look at
[1:45:53] themselves as as great Sinners as if the
[1:45:57] ones that have done a lot of sins but
[1:45:59] when you convert a
[1:46:01] brother at times that word will save
[1:46:03] your
[1:46:07] brother at times even bad things happen
[1:46:09] in life just to be an example to
[1:46:14] us Samson failed very many times he he
[1:46:19] disobeyed God but at the at at the the
[1:46:23] last moment God remembered
[1:46:27] him he did not give
[1:46:30] up at times we we should also not give
[1:46:33] up on our
[1:46:37] brothers even when they they they annoy
[1:46:40] sweeten that anger with prayer and love
[1:46:44] when you love
[1:46:45] someone they will they will they will
[1:46:48] look at you as something as someone so
[1:46:50] different even when they are doing bad
[1:46:53] to
[1:46:55] you so amidst all those things amidst
[1:46:58] the troubles you go
[1:47:00] through it has upon God because he says
[1:47:04] those that wait upon thee because he
[1:47:07] says those that wait upon the Lord he
[1:47:10] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:47:12] Mount their wings like eagles they shall
[1:47:14] run and not be weary they shall walk and
[1:47:17] not
[1:47:18] faint
[1:47:20] amen those that wait up on the Lord not
[1:47:24] those that wait upon man at times even
[1:47:28] we get we get angry over our brothers
[1:47:30] when he says please I cannot help you in
[1:47:36] this because you not know the reasons
[1:47:38] why they're not helping you you just get
[1:47:41] angry say that brother you cannot even
[1:47:43] help
[1:47:44] me but the Bible is telling us we should
[1:47:47] wait upon the Lord he may not use that
[1:47:50] person and he uses the other person to
[1:47:53] help you because you waited upon the
[1:47:55] Lord not waiting upon
[1:47:59] man
[1:48:01] Hallelujah yeah we should be serious of
[1:48:04] what we we are holding I mean it's
[1:48:06] everything because trials are going to
[1:48:08] come to test you whether you you're
[1:48:11] stable they will come and Shake you to
[1:48:15] see how how strong are you and what you
[1:48:18] you claim to
[1:48:20] be then your true characters are going
[1:48:22] to come come
[1:48:24] out if you're a genuine believer your
[1:48:27] characters are going to come
[1:48:29] out but if you're there
[1:48:32] there I don't
[1:48:36] know so everyone has a battle to
[1:48:41] fight here brother bam
[1:48:44] says in the
[1:48:50] message in a message
[1:48:53] acts of the Holy
[1:48:55] Spirit he says times may be
[1:48:59] hard God has not promised a flly bed of
[1:49:03] e but he has promised Grace sufficient
[1:49:07] for every trial that can hit
[1:49:10] you that's right yes indeed grace is
[1:49:15] sufficient not he is on a flower flower
[1:49:19] flowerly bed of his but he promise great
[1:49:22] CH overcome in every Temptation when a
[1:49:25] cross gets heavy Christ promis to be
[1:49:29] with
[1:49:31] you it is not a flly bed of his being a
[1:49:35] Christian is really not a joking
[1:49:39] subject because even what you're going
[1:49:42] to to to get it will be worth
[1:49:48] it Jesus Christ died for us at the cross
[1:49:51] he shed his blood because we're worth
[1:49:55] that but when we do not look at
[1:49:59] that and we look at other things I don't
[1:50:08] know here we see God was telling Joshua
[1:50:14] to be of good
[1:50:17] courage even in everything we go
[1:50:20] through at least keep encouraging your
[1:50:22] yourself ah one day one day I will make
[1:50:26] it one day I will overcome this don't
[1:50:30] make yourself say I'm a loser failed
[1:50:33] here and
[1:50:34] here say what I will make
[1:50:37] it come at me I know I will make it you
[1:50:41] have to just make
[1:50:43] that confirm it to yourself that I will
[1:50:46] make it because everything has the
[1:50:49] beginning and the end even our pains and
[1:50:52] sufferings have begins and and the
[1:50:54] end
[1:50:56] everything has a beginning and the
[1:51:04] end so we should always pray
[1:51:07] soon pray on every day every
[1:51:15] hour and we shall
[1:51:19] overcome at times as I'm concluding
[1:51:23] I always have I always have something
[1:51:25] that I always requested God to always do
[1:51:28] for
[1:51:32] me among my
[1:51:35] siblings my my elders left the message
[1:51:40] we all born in the
[1:51:44] message but as I was also
