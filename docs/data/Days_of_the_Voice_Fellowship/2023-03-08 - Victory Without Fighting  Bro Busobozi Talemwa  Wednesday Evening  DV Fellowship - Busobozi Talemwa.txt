says giving just hold on our Lord will surround but he will take you through the fire again amen I'd like us to see the cross again if you can sing with me if you remember those words he never promised that a cross would not get heavy and he would not be hard to cry it never offered our victories without fighting but he said airport always come in time brother who remember when you're standing in the body of decision and the adversary says giving or just hold on our Lord will show up he will show up and he will take you through the fire again how many believe that today [Music] and he takes us through the fire how many has the Lord taken through the fire [Music] has it ever taken you through the fire then you know the god that we suck what a mighty God we saw Angel's bar I'm preparing you for what you're going to hear so you might as well stand up and join me for one or two minutes we're seeing that oh what a mighty God we suck What a Mighty God [Music] let me ask you a question have you have you ever seen Soldiers [Music] the song is tonight I'm gonna talk about battles so we are soldiers when soldiers are going to attack they begin by singing warming up and then they go and touch the eyes Oh What a Mighty God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm speaking to you today on Victory without fighting Victory without fighting [Music] now Victory cannot come without fighting constances many people desire to have Victory but they don't like to fight many people fight but lose their battles and a True Believer is never meant to be on the losing site victory in all his battles you know if you have a True Believer in every battle you fight you will win that kills if you're a True Believer there is no battle that will ever win you but I'm okay you can never be on the losing side you will always be on The Winning Side just you know we have to follow the script Twitter I got to go very rich we have to follow what has been written about us and for us to follow we shouldn't write our own word or our own scripture to follow but if we follow what has been written if we follow what has been given to us then we are rest assured we shall all good day foreign you know I've been seeing a lot I'm not a football fan myself and that makes the world look like what and you're a man yes [Music] and so I've been seeing things all over social media and you see uh the the the the the the the supporters of Liverpool I've been cheering they're telling all the other losers and that and that's what I wanted us to talk about tonight and what is so amazing that I want to talk about it you don't even need to fight get your Victory the believer will always get Victory without fighting one that is a confusing thing it is uh like the prophet would say a paradox you see but that's the truth let us look at the Battle of Judah that we have read about in The Book of uh Second Chronicles that we read to those of you who Miss second chronicles 20 from verse 1 to 26. here in in there were three powerful United Kingdoms again and they were all coming against one little kingdom called Judas and this little kingdom was being led by a king called jehoshaphas he was a Man Who Loved God there was a Man Who Loved prayer he was a man who revered God above all others and so you know they are these three kingdoms that United themselves against the kingdom of Judah and they came they agreed to come and fight and kill all the inhabitants of of Jerusalem [Music] and so as we read in the scripture the man of God was tipped someone came and told him you know all Kings have spies and so maybe one of his spies that is uh there's a conspiration a conspiration between the Three Kingdoms the kingdom of the moabites the kingdom of the uh of those men living in them says it and also there was another attacking of the ammonites and he said they have conspired against us and as I'm speaking to you [Music] [Music] [Music] and that's usually what happens to every believer when you are in a situation and you can't you know the only thing he could do was to retreat okay but that was not an option I want you to see the Believers the ones who believe this Bible who believe the message they never have an option of surrender among the options we have there is no option of retreat or Surrender why because we don't fight our own battles when he realized what was before immediately he went before God he began praying he began praying he reminded God this was the little Nation by killing us to tell God how can you let this happening here is a king going before God In Prayer a True Believer besides his battle in prayer that's why you're praying Christians but if you live a prayerless life you can never receive any victories but when he was first with the battle he realized the only thing he can do was not to cry crying does not move God do you know that when you are in a problem God just looks at you and wonders what is wrong with this crime does not move God does not move but there is something that moves amen that is prayer Sarah days of their voice Fellowship that we must learn how to pray you must learn how to pray when you are in your home you must learn how to pray [Music] your prayers pray until what the burden of your heart is until you feel God Amen your prayers touch God are you telling what I'm saying we should learn how to pray if we learn how to pray God is going to begin bringing victories on our side hallelujah amen so the king did not have an option of surrender because he knows God was with him the king and his people as any believers do opted to gather strength and confidence by the way of Prayer and our God when when called on is always a very present here foreign [Applause] gathered themselves together to ask to ask the help of the Lord even out of the of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord and before the new court and said oh Lord God of our fathers not thou over all the kingdoms of the of the heathens so that none is able to withstand this are you not our God who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel foreign um you drove out already inhabitants of this land and you gave it to the Seed of Abraham your friend forever no you will accept the day Ibrahimovic and they dwell therein and have built their Sanctuary therein for thy name and they were saying if when evil comes upon us as the sword Judgment of pestilence of famine they said we will stand before this house thy name is in this house and we shall cry out in our afflictions hallelujah amen the solution of a believer in a problem when you are he said sword or judgment over [Music] how they reward us now to come to cast us out of their position that has given us to inherit [Music] [Music] stood before the Lord with their little ones with their wives and their children in this prayer meeting there was the little children one of the wives the women and the men everyone meaning this was the most important meeting the most important service when Believers don't come to a prayer meeting it's a clear sign that they don't even pray at their homes in their lives they don't pray but in this prayer meeting their wives their little ones their children everyone they were all calling upon the Lord even the king himself but let me tell you when you cook when something like this happens God must always speak foreign you know the the presence of God amen [Music] and at that moment one brother who was also among them fearful shaking like the rest of them but then the spirit of God it came on him that's why we believe in the gifts of the holy spirit now if you didn't believe these things the church would be dead We Believe In Dreams in Prophecy we believe in tongues an interpretation of tongues these are the gifts of the Spirit you believe in preaching because through these gifts God comes down and he speaks to the child but now you see if these people didn't believe it if they despise what God was saying this one is also just getting excited foreign [Music] they come up I love I love I love prophecy when God speaks it is [Music] he says go against them because they are coming by the grief of this again [Music] and he shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness your enemies and it's going to pass by foreign the movement of the soldier is kept as a secret because if your enemy knows how you're going to move you are finished he will just come and Ambush you now they were coming Secrets but if you go in prayer God reveals the plan God reveals [Music] is it just a dream how is plotting to come yeah God is trying to say that is [Applause] I even know how your enemies and when the enemy comes in like a flower the spirit of God raises and at that moment he said he shall not need oh my good Lord hey hallelujah amen tell your neighbor you will not need to fight again louder amen oh my how many feel excited today hallelujah amen he said search yourselves such yourselves yes set yourselves for the Lord will be with you Hallelujah and that was a prophecy or when nobody will not be that came out of prayer and when the Believers had that oh hallelujah hallelujah you know the Bible says he says despise not prophesy in first Thessalonians as long as the people believed God [Music] and their prophets their preachers said believe God believe it believe it is you see they have surrendered these people they surrender their responsibility of fighting to God say God I'm no longer going to fight them I just believe what you say your word must fulfill this is I don't know why some Believers like fighting for themselves brother don't fight for yourself and if you don't pray you are someone who is fighting for yourself but if you learn how to pray you've come to this place of saying take it to the Lord in prayer if you take something before the Lord it is the beginning it's just like when where a child takes a kiss to his father [Music] or his mother and says does it stop there because this child expects the father or the mother to ask where did he beat you you say here and he will do he wants comfortable he wants the other things for you to revenge and so the father will say called the one who beat you tell him to come here no foreign hallelujah amen as I was studying this I was so excited but never then to know that God told them he spoke to the through the prophecy you will not need to fight it is finished but if I you find people fighting their battles people going to witchcraft and even some Believers think about it you know it's just Africans let me tell you if you go to be with someone born again you're fighting your own battles if someone has done you bad um do them well it is so bad it's so maybe it's so sad God before the Lord in prayer foreign battles prayer is not just talking to God in the beginning you're talking to God you are asking him to come and begin fighting your battles that's why prayer is a two-way thing when you go in prayer you are reporting the matter and God is deploying the swords in the places he knows that amen that you can that that your enemies are coming that's why when we go in spiritual a spiritual LED prayer anointed by the holy ghosts the Bible says even the spirit himself he will make intercession the Bible say [Applause] hallelujah amen Our God isn't lift up your heads lift them up when you get it yeah Everlasting doors our God is foreign that way that's why when you go to prayer your angel goes at work hallelujah amen These Are Spiritual things you need to understand [Music] God knows foreign that's why it says I am sheltered in the arms of God let the storms Hallelujah you won't worry how can we be shouted when we can pray our Victory as Believers fought in prayer when we go to prayer together brother Dixon are you in the church with us when you were in prayer when you go on your knees God must hear that prayer employees the armies of Heaven God is the best on the earth I can give you some examples and all the examples of all the battles God foreign foreign talk about the battle between Gideon and the Americas do you remember that one how Gideon had a great great big army and God told him scale it down scale it down I don't want you to go and fight so that at the end you will say you are the one who forgot me yeah foreign so that no one will take glorified that's why sometimes you reach into places of frustration as if everyone has ignored you God is just trying to slap you um so you can now learn how to pray God wants you to depend on him and him alone from from all that huge Amen to just three thousand people 300 people and you know how he is he reached that number um go by the water I will tell you how to trim the Army down and by the time foreign Huawei [Music] and so he remained with 300. 300 men America they had filled the whole valley your enemies and you see these ones were just a few our God is the Lord of us he knows how to strategize and so he told them get a sword get a picture and now put the light inside the pictures and now you see you when the trumpet sounds so as they did that remember collaborative 100 did it 100 years [Applause] the pictures of the pictures you know you know you know making you know like making uh urinating on themselves God proved himself hallelujah amen what do you think was happening God sent his angels to fight that battle and is the same God foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] what is happening go in prayer brother when I pray I feel nothing even nothing happens just do what he says but his part never fails and so they went around and run and run around and on the last day they went around seven times as he had said and the walls everything began crumbling everything [Music] just without anybody touching God told him Joshua with you I will split rocks but just had never did anything rather you have to do nothing but to obey the world when you obey the word of God God will do his particle fell down what it Israel was rejoicing talk about David and they were coming fight Quran David and his armies now the Nigeria and David that feared so much but God told him you just stay in one place I know where the Philistines it will come to pass foreign [Music] that even when the rest of the world thought that they would not win it what is behind Israel if God is behind natural Israel how much more his children his spiritual children watch him fight our battles and then we shall have Victory without fighting to myself and I want to finish with this quote in the message the Great and Mighty conqueror it is there would be someone in this building in this morning I don't know the joy of the battle being over you know when Israel won their battle when Judah won the battle against the other three kingdoms do you know what I did we read it here do you remember anybody remember that yes they sang songs can you go back to that part and remind them verse 21 read verse 21. [Music] you see that's why we praise God you know we should do it with joy we don't do it as a duty only do it with joy as a people who have been a beneficiaries of his victory there's some people who are made happy with money when you have money in your pocket you don't even need to ask everybody when you have money just feel so peacefulness is ah you know because you have money even when it comes to worshiping the church I just oh I just love it you know but when when the time comes and you have nothing he would say hey I'm not feeling well I don't even have a special song [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] is not only prayer foreign foreign [Music] [Music] and they were smitten let me tell you do you know how they were smitten the Bible says imagine when you are singing You're great you are charged up no come on hallelujah praise God Amen praise God when you are singing the song ambushments against your enemy foreign I have sad in my heart to the extent that the Bible said verse 24. every man when Judah came to what they watched Tower in the wilderness they looked unto the marketing and behold they were they were dead bodies fall into the Earth Amina and the none escaped when God fights your battle Cartoon Network none of your enemies none of your enemies you see someone in this building people rejoice foreign [Music] that's why when you see someone whipping in the church Someone rejoicing hallelujah amen and and you are scared no no it means you don't know what they have experienced but if you're not like I know you experience it like I've experienced we are all going to shout to Rejoice because of the joy of the battle beings he says we are beating by the bands we are screaming the trumpets and the gospel is going out the glory and power of God is known it is a finished work the truth is glory to God Christ signed it in his own place he says the Battle Is Over the victory is won and he says I never want it he won it I'm just happy about it hallelujah amen I never want it you want it yeah are you happy about it tonight stand on your feet tonight Hallelujah Hallelujah we are happy about it because he has done it for us better sing Jesus I'll never forget what you've done foreign [Music] [Music] brought me out oh Jesus I'll never forget he brought me out he brought me out all the married amen oh yes Lord he said my tree [Music] [Music] [Music] today I saw the praise [Music] I'll never forget [Music] oh yes Lord Jesus I never forget said absolutely free Jesus I'll never forget hallelujah oh Jesus I'll never forget oh no [Music] never mind foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus is keeping me Hallelujah [Music] [Music] reach high dark clouds let them rise Forum shelters [Music] of God Walks With Me I know [Music] I am she EP Daddy [Music] one more time [Music] that dark clouds rise they won't worry me foreign [Music] [Music] ah yeah Daddy [Music] Daddy Lord Jesus [Music] I'm sheltered in your arms nothing of this Earth can harm me [Music] between my battles and I take the spoilers I win the victories without fighting because you fight my back and in prayer is how they believe us Lord and how they went with their little children in other battles women and children don't go but it is [Music] [Music] [Music] father we have a lot to ask but I'm sure you know our desires the precious name of Jesus amen [Applause] [Music] God bless you [Music] before we go I would just like to remind you that this coming Sunday we have a minister a visiting Minister um I spoke with him today um so please be here on Sunday on time and also invite others to come and be blessed otherwise we shall meet in a prayer meeting on Friday that's where we fight our battles so let's come and fight our brothers [Music] so God bless you as we give our offerings we can be dismissed [Music] amen [Music] we make a miracle worker hold me skip lying in the darkness my God that is who you are [Music] away [Music] in the darkness my God that is [Music] [Music] who you are [Music] here I go [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] to you baby [Music] what is who you are that is who you are oh that is who you are [Music]
