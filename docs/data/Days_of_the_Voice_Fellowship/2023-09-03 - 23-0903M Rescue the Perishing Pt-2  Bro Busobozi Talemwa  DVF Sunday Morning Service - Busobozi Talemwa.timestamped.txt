[1:12:24] [Music]
[1:12:27] so what I wanted to show you is just a
[1:12:29] few slides
[1:12:30] [Music]
[1:12:32] a few pictures that are really important
[1:12:35] for you to see
[1:12:37] um
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:40] I know brother Isaac could show it
[1:12:41] online but I wanted you here to see it
[1:12:45] again
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:49] is that going to work brother Isaac
[1:12:51] China
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:13:04] my wife and I a few years ago
[1:13:10] took a trip to uh to Ethiopia
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:15] Ethiopia but before we got married we
[1:13:20] knew that the Lord had a you know a
[1:13:22] mission for us there
[1:13:24] is
[1:13:28] started about three years before I I got
[1:13:32] married actually
[1:13:36] and I wanted to go to Ethiopia
[1:13:38] but they started as a desire because at
[1:13:41] that time I was you know traveling from
[1:13:42] place to place
[1:13:47] [Music]
[1:13:49] you know several African countries
[1:13:54] but now it became intense in 2011 when I
[1:13:57] went to
[1:13:58] um Zimbabwe for a mission trip
[1:14:07] it would appear that whenever I open my
[1:14:09] bible to read
[1:14:11] foreign
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:49] sister came and spoke about Ethiopia
[1:14:51] like he's mentioned about Ethiopia about
[1:14:54] 10 times
[1:15:01] and so it drew my attention
[1:15:06] I started now wanting to find out
[1:15:08] whether they were Believers in Ethiopia
[1:15:13] stand out that there seemed not to be a
[1:15:16] church even a church of the message in
[1:15:18] Ethiopia
[1:15:21] Ethiopia so one time I went to sorority
[1:15:26] how many know pastors
[1:15:35] introduced me to a brother who had been
[1:15:38] in Ethiopia um
[1:15:44] this brother had visited another brother
[1:15:46] in Ethiopia
[1:15:49] so apparently this brother was from
[1:15:52] Kenya yeah
[1:15:55] and so we tried to contact him to allow
[1:15:59] us to come and visit
[1:16:03] this is what he told me
[1:16:05] he said well of course after several
[1:16:09] words that were exchanged
[1:16:13] and he had asked me a few questions
[1:16:17] like how old are you name are you
[1:16:20] married
[1:16:21] are you a preacher how long did you
[1:16:25] start preaching from the time you
[1:16:26] believed
[1:16:32] and then he asked me a little more
[1:16:34] questions
[1:16:36] and then it seemed that I failed the
[1:16:39] interview
[1:16:41] [Music]
[1:16:45] I'm sorry I cannot receive you in
[1:16:46] Ethiopia
[1:16:52] and also it doesn't seem that uh the
[1:16:56] field is large two friends you don't
[1:17:00] even have money
[1:17:01] and it's expensive here
[1:17:06] even the language is difficult they
[1:17:08] don't speak English
[1:17:11] so it's difficult for me to receive you
[1:17:13] here
[1:17:15] I cannot sustain you the things out and
[1:17:18] I don't feel led to receive you
[1:17:23] the food is large singers if God has
[1:17:27] sent you you will take care of it
[1:17:32] that's what he told me and I was so
[1:17:36] disappointed
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:38] friends sometimes when you are turned
[1:17:40] down
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:43] it doesn't mean that God has turned you
[1:17:45] down
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:47] sometimes when you are turned down it is
[1:17:49] that God is opening
[1:17:54] and so I was turned down
[1:17:57] and
[1:17:59] um but somehow because of that I went
[1:18:02] before the Lord
[1:18:04] and I prayed a sincere prayer
[1:18:08] Lord if it is your will for me to go to
[1:18:10] Ethiopia
[1:18:13] provide to me the money
[1:18:17] saying that I would not have to ask
[1:18:18] anybody because
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:21] I need money to go there
[1:18:24] you and um also I say Lord may you also
[1:18:28] give me a contact
[1:18:31] someone I will not need to beg to come
[1:18:36] so uh about a year and a half later
[1:18:41] in 2013.
[1:18:45] I was supposed to get married actually I
[1:18:48] was supposed to get married in December
[1:18:49] of 2012.
[1:18:54] but then I
[1:18:56] had a dream
[1:18:57] and in this dream I I saw myself
[1:19:01] um change someone asking me to change my
[1:19:04] wedding date
[1:19:09] this would be a signature
[1:19:12] that person that will ask me to do that
[1:19:15] will be the one to solemnize my weddings
[1:19:22] so I shared that with my pastor at that
[1:19:24] time
[1:19:32] out of all the friends and brothers in
[1:19:35] the ministry that I had sent out email
[1:19:37] to inform them about my wedding movie
[1:19:42] one of them wrote back
[1:19:45] and and he told me look he said brother
[1:19:48] brother we are our church
[1:19:52] is intending to have their students
[1:19:55] because they have a church school
[1:20:03] to come to Uganda
[1:20:05] Uganda we are going to visit Pastor
[1:20:07] Stephen ibalist Church in ginger
[1:20:08] together
[1:20:11] they accepted me to come
[1:20:14] rather he said if you accepted to change
[1:20:17] your debts
[1:20:20] from December to March when we are when
[1:20:23] they are coming
[1:20:26] because my daughter is coming with them
[1:20:30] I will take it as from the Lord also for
[1:20:32] me to come along
[1:20:39] this dream this what this email was
[1:20:43] saying was exactly revealed to me in the
[1:20:45] dream two weeks before it happened
[1:20:52] so it was not a problem I told Pastor
[1:20:54] Leo he had already known about it
[1:20:59] was the one supposed to wait me and my
[1:21:01] wife
[1:21:04] God had already organized for this
[1:21:06] brother to come and wear them
[1:21:09] but here is what we did not know
[1:21:13] God was also dealing with him and and
[1:21:16] his church in Canada
[1:21:21] about Ethiopia they had a burden to
[1:21:25] support the working ethics
[1:21:40] and I was in Uganda I did not have the
[1:21:43] money to go because
[1:21:46] I didn't have the money
[1:21:49] but I wanted to see God working on both
[1:21:51] sides
[1:21:52] foreign
[1:22:21] he said where are you going
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:33] because we have
[1:22:36] all the resources we put them in the
[1:22:38] wedding and
[1:22:39] send this is
[1:22:42] and so he said ah I have a proposal
[1:22:46] why don't you go to Ethiopia for your
[1:22:49] honeymoon
[1:22:53] three years after the prayer I pray
[1:22:59] before I was ever in contact with this
[1:23:02] brother
[1:23:04] and and so when he said he mentioned
[1:23:07] Ethiopia boy are you getting a question
[1:23:09] he was saying honeymoon
[1:23:20] because this brother said I am going to
[1:23:23] take care of all the expenses
[1:23:26] foreign
[1:23:38] I couldn't move
[1:23:41] not because of the money she was sent
[1:23:44] but because of a prayer that God
[1:23:46] answered so perfect now you always said
[1:23:49] so perfect
[1:23:51] three years before
[1:23:53] years later
[1:23:55] he's answering the first prayer
[1:23:58] all the money we needed is
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:09] when the brothers and the sisters in our
[1:24:11] little church had that I was planning
[1:24:13] honeymoon to Ethiopia
[1:24:19] some of them were offended
[1:24:22] because I remember there was a family
[1:24:24] that sold their piglets
[1:24:29] to support my wedding
[1:24:32] so they said
[1:24:34] if he had money
[1:24:36] why did you did you leave us to sell our
[1:24:39] people
[1:24:41] but I didn't have money this was
[1:24:44] completely Supernatural
[1:24:47] and so now I'm on the computer with my
[1:24:50] wife
[1:24:51] trying to book a ticket
[1:24:56] and here's what God does
[1:24:59] someone calls me from Nairobi never met
[1:25:04] him
[1:25:07] but he was on the internet
[1:25:09] and he read my website not show my
[1:25:13] website it read about me on our website
[1:25:15] website if you want you young people you
[1:25:18] can look for Rich the youth message site
[1:25:21] you
[1:25:25] you saw my testimony
[1:25:29] say to me that the Holy Spirit
[1:25:35] to invite me to Kenya um to go and
[1:25:39] baptize the people that had believed
[1:25:41] under his ministers Ethiopia
[1:25:53] so when he mentioned to me I have a
[1:25:57] group of Ethiopians
[1:26:00] and God has told me
[1:26:03] ask you especially you um
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:08] immediately I knew that that was God
[1:26:10] answering the second prayers
[1:26:20] so then
[1:26:40] and this man was uh very happy to see us
[1:26:43] yes it was the very first Ethiopian I've
[1:26:46] ever interacted with
[1:27:08] in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:27:12] came out of the world
[1:27:18] he gave us a contact of his brothers
[1:27:27] foreign
[1:28:16] it's the first time I do this so please
[1:28:17] excuse me
[1:28:20] so this is the man I don't know whether
[1:28:22] you can see him clearly there
[1:28:24] his name is
[1:28:29] I believe those who are online can view
[1:28:31] this better and if you want to view it
[1:28:34] in a better way you can view this after
[1:28:35] the service
[1:28:36] so uh you see the man standing behind
[1:28:39] there
[1:28:42] and if you see the man on the extreme
[1:28:44] right yo
[1:28:49] I always forget his name but maybe I'll
[1:28:51] remember it
[1:28:52] and so that is the man that called me
[1:28:55] and I met him there for the first time
[1:28:59] baptism a pastor rather the man called
[1:29:03] the reason
[1:29:05] you can see I was very little and small
[1:29:07] foreign
[1:29:45] so while I was preaching give me the
[1:29:47] next slide
[1:29:48] and by the way go back there oh
[1:29:52] they this place
[1:29:55] recently when we were in Nairobi I don't
[1:29:58] know if Isaac and uh Isaac remembers
[1:30:02] you remember when we were coming out of
[1:30:04] the pastor's office
[1:30:06] do you remember the man that came and
[1:30:08] approached me and
[1:30:11] foreign
[1:31:00] and uh
[1:31:03] she was uh if you see that sister with a
[1:31:05] with some papers
[1:31:08] my wife was very busy while I'm
[1:31:10] preaching she was also very busy
[1:31:11] Distributing trucks
[1:31:14] so she made friends with this sister
[1:31:18] praise the Lord so when we went to
[1:31:21] Ethiopia in Ethiopia give me the next
[1:31:24] Slide
[1:31:25] the Kenyan Ethiopian I met
[1:31:30] Ethiopia when he had the message

[2:25:43] people go for uh please somebody throw

[2:26:46] church is
[2:26:48] the
[2:27:47] even more than a place
[2:28:45] that when Jesus served
[2:28:51] he brought him later
[2:28:55] to and in
[2:28:59] and he found this man which is
[2:29:05] but if you've got a place
[2:29:08] that you can direct him too
[2:29:11] like Jesus with with the Samaritan
[2:29:14] you're taking him to the end
[2:29:16] he said a Good Samaritan taking the
[2:29:19] falling man into the ears
[2:29:22] we got to have a place like that or you
[2:29:25] know
[2:29:26] like in Ethiopia for instance
[2:29:28] when you see me or anybody going to
[2:29:31] Ethiopia
[2:29:32] our purpose
[2:29:35] is not to start a Church secretary or
[2:29:39] religious order
[2:29:43] [Applause]
[2:29:45] the purpose of evangelism
[2:29:48] is to start to bring to rescue souls
[2:29:53] to rescue Souls from the enemies
[2:29:58] of sin deceit religion
[2:30:04] you will need a place to take them to
[2:30:07] enter again
[2:30:08] why churches are started
[2:30:12] if someone now believes by my Ministry
[2:30:20] if it's another place
[2:30:24] that's why you don't be surprised to
[2:30:26] hear more churches
[2:30:31] because our purpose is to rescue Souls
[2:30:38] [Music]
[2:30:42] Uganda

[2:30:45] we do not
[2:30:46] our place
[2:30:48] it's not to start churches
[2:30:51] but if God sends a Ministries
[2:30:58] Uganda and souls get saved if there is
[2:31:01] no church nearby
[2:31:02] we start one
[2:31:05] and I'll tell you we shall stop them
[2:31:09] why why she said the church
[2:31:13] we have no Desires in those things
[2:31:19] bring a message

[2:31:27] a true God called preacher

[2:40:11] [Applause]
[2:40:25] [Music]
[2:41:20] [Music]
[2:41:24] from that moment
[2:41:27] my attitude changed
[2:41:30] that's why if you know me I am not a
[2:41:33] judging person
[2:41:36] I believe God can deliver anybody and
[2:41:39] everybody
[2:41:42] in any condition
[2:41:44] this righteous than thou attitude
[2:42:03] hallelujah amen he rescued this man he

[2:42:25] talk about judging with foreign
[2:42:58] what was going on
[2:43:00] God was rescuing
[2:43:03] she didn't see this judgments
[2:43:08] amen hallelujah in the morning she came
[2:43:12] with a gowns
[2:43:14] [Music]

[2:43:20] changed
[2:43:22] and that was the last time
[2:43:26] foreign
[2:43:31] God used that woman
[2:43:33] you deliver the whole country
[2:43:37] to bring the message
[2:43:46] when my wife and I went
[2:43:50] and she didn't have money we didn't have

[2:45:37] that the church the condition is
[2:45:39] supposed to be a place where you find
[2:45:41] God called ministers
[2:45:45] that's why a minister
[2:45:48] should not stand before the people
[2:45:52] unless he has heard from God

[2:45:58] today is
[2:45:59] because I have a message

[2:46:40] in this man um
[2:46:44] he would not have given him that
[2:46:46] response
[2:46:49] God has response God has responsibility
[2:47:01] people to take responsibility over them
