[0:04] be a bride and there's going to be a
[0:06] wedding supper served in the sky

[0:13] because it's his word
[0:16] [Music]
[0:24] i will receive yourself lord

[0:32] sister who's listening to us
[0:37] welcome to the voice of uh the days of
[0:39] the voice broadcast
[0:41] comparison days of the voice i trust
[0:44] that this will be a blessing to you
[0:45] hello
[0:47] works
[0:48] now we we're just picking up from where
[0:50] we left from together we killed our way
[0:53] to our command and we had just dealt
[0:55] with the first church age two
[1:10] says and unto the angel of the church in
[1:13] this manner right this thing says the
[1:15] first and the last witch was dead and is
[1:16] alive
[1:18] i know their works and tribulation and
[1:19] poverty but that had reached and i know
[1:21] that blasphemy of them which said that
[1:24] they are jews and are not at the
[1:25] synagogue of saturn for none of these of
[1:28] those things
[1:29] which thou shalt suffer behold the devil
[1:32] shall cast some of you into prison that
[1:35] he may be tried and he that you shall
[1:37] have tribulation 10 days be thou
[1:39] faithful and to death and i will give
[1:41] thee a crown of life
[2:28] and we noticed that this was the time
[2:31] that the church of jesus christ was
[2:33] under interest persecution
[2:44] [Music]
[3:01] uh but also it was a bit of substance
[3:05] so two things out of that which is
[3:07] bitterness
[3:09] and death
[3:13] so we noticed that samana was a
[3:34] fear none of these things which thou
[3:35] shalt suffer before the devil shall cast
[3:38] some of you into prison
[3:40] that he may be tried and that he shall
[3:43] have tribulation 10 days
[3:45] be thou faithful and to date and i will
[3:47] give thee a call of life
[4:08] [Music]
[4:51] [Music]
[4:54] that was between
[5:12] [Music]
[5:22] 12
[5:24] of the chart in beggar must write these
[5:26] things if he which has the sharp sword
[5:29] with the two agents
[5:36] turner
[5:51] are then that hold the doctrine of
[5:53] balaam who taught balak to cast a
[5:56] stumbling block before the children of
[5:58] israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[6:00] idols and to commit fornication
[6:02] so as to thou also then that all the
[6:04] doctrine of the nicolas which thing i
[6:07] had
[6:10] [Music]
[6:31] this is the generation where the church
[6:33] and the state came together
[6:44] the states
[6:49] remember this was the same period in
[6:52] three hundred and twenty five eight days
[6:55] [Music]
[6:59] where emperor constantine invited all
[7:02] the bishops
[7:03] in asia
[7:09] at a place called nikia that's where
[7:11] they held their conference
[7:21] [Music]
[7:28] was
[7:30] [Music]
[7:41] we know today as the roman catholic
[7:42] church
[7:44] [Music]
[7:49] the church
[7:52] they put a hierarchy never taken
[7:57] [Music]
[8:24] and so from that time we see that even
[8:28] the bible itself says that's where
[8:29] saturn is
[8:31] [Music]
[8:45] [Music]
[8:51] is
[9:19] [Music]
[9:40] [Music]
[10:44] that claimed
[10:47] [Music]
[10:56] [Music]
[10:58] nico
[11:01] and this is the name
[11:04] of the lady
[11:06] so that the denomination now said we are
[11:09] the ones controlling you
[11:11] [Music]
[11:12] know
[11:39] [Music]
[12:08] something that is not in the scripture
[12:10] then are you going to go with what
[12:12] scripture says or what you're doing
[12:15] is
[12:45] [Music]
[13:01] [Music]
[13:17] the bible speaks that very well
[13:24] not a woman to teach me not to assault
[13:26] authority over the man
[13:29] [Music]
[13:31] so if any poor people in the church and
[13:33] their pulpit they allow a woman to teach
[13:35] or to assert affirmative over the men
[13:37] it's a vast swedenbc
[14:14] yes
[14:29] the people to preach
[14:33] that kind of thing in the scriptures
[14:36] it's the spirit of jesus
[14:39] whenever you see a woman wanting to
[14:41] dominate
[14:50] [Music]
[15:02] [Music]
[15:09] [Music]
[15:18] is
[15:20] [Music]
