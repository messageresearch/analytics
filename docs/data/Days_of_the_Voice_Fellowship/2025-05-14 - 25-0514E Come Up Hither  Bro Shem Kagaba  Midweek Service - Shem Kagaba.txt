Holy s of glory. Let me in my voice and tears all pass at last to rejoice. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's pray. Follow dear heaven father king of glory before. We ask you Lord father that may you come and take over. May you get me out of the way and Lord just use my lips of care and Lord I believe each one of us be blessed may break the bread of life because that's the bride's food in the name of our Lord Jesus. Amen. Maybe before you sit, we can go straight to the word. You open the book of Revelation chapter 4, just the two verses. Are we all there? says, "After this, I looked, and behold, a door was open in heaven." And uh and the first voice which I heard was as it it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter." And immediately I was in the spirit, and behold, the throne was sat in heaven, and one sat on the throne. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated. You'll forgive me. My voice is not that good as usual. But I believe God is here still. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm happy to see each and every one of you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We thank God that we still have life and we are still serving him. Amen. So I will title my subject tonight. Come up hither. Hallelujah. Uh the scripture that we have read, the prophet refers to it many times and he always uh refers to it as uh the going out of the church. The going out of the church, the church going up. Hallelujah. And we all know that John was a type of of the bride. You are represented by John there. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I would like you to pray with me what the Lord has given me to come out because receiving an inspiration is another thing and also bringing it up. Hallelujah. And now we see this uh chapter that we have read Before this chapter there is chapter three. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see that chapter three talks about the condition of our age. Hallelujah. And then the prophet came he preached chapter one chapter 2 chapter 3. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then and then we see here John saying that there was a door opening. But you remember in chapter three the door was closed and Jesus is closed outside. He's trying to knock to enter in. And now we can say that he was locked outside denomination. But as we are going to see uh the this book is the book of [Music] prophecy and there it's layered. It is in layers. You can open the first layer and you find dos and don'ts, how to be a good Christian. But again, you can read it and you find out it is talking about God, the deed of Jesus Christ. And then again you read it, you find it is talking about you. And then again you read it another layer you find that he's talking about the masterpiece Jesus Christ and the bride. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So this book is a book of prophecy. So Jesus was outside and we we can easily say he's outside the denomination. But as we going to see as we go on, Jesus Christ is outside of each one's heart as far as concerned. But I have good news for you this that John looked after this after what? After revelation chapter 3, he said that I looked and behold there was a open in heaven. Hallelujah. And then the prophet comes and says that chapter 4 is the only solution for chapter 3. The only solution that we have for Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now when you look at chapter four, there are very many things in there, but I will not talk about all of them. I just pick a few, I believe, like four [Music] verses. And if you want more, you can go also read the series that the prophet preached about Revelation 4. I believe we get more than that. And now let's first go a little bit back in chapter three. What is there chap verse 17 says that because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have and have need of nothing and know not that thou at miserable and poor and blind and naked. [Music] And then he said that I counel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be riched rich and white remnant that thou mayest be clothed and that the ashame of thy nakedness. Do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thyelves that thou may see. [Music] As many as I love, I rebuke and just be zealous therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to sap and sap with him and he with me. [Music] And you see when you read about the all church ages, you will see that it's only when the angel say that be zealous and repent. Why? Because he saw that this age most all the people will lose their zeal. and they will lose the zeal of God, the zeal of the word of God. But the angel is saying that be zealous and repent. Hallelujah. So and and then when you got the message masterpiece, I know if you have ever read it, the prophet say that now the bride is smitten out of our neck. She is smitten to enter where into revelation 4 as we are going to see that revelation chapter 4 it was again typed in I believe is it exodus no I think it's numbers which numbers I believe chapter 2, Exodus chapter 25 and Numbers chapter 2. Hallelujah. We're going to see now and by God's grace. I want us to reduce this revelation 4. I want us to reduce this revelation 4 like to to the door of an individual here. Hallelujah. So the prophet say that uh the bread is eaten and then he said that the church goes up and then he said that the solution forian condition. It is the church to go up through that door that is open and of course you cannot fly high and you go through that open door. when you're not an eagle. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So we see here that uh the reason why here the angel cried out that be zealous and repent. We see also in the book of Romans Paul talks about that to be cannally minded is death. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So to be cannal minded, you can easily interpret it like thinking evil, thinking about immorality and all that. But being Canada minded, it means just being minded about the natural things, business, food, [Music] family, your errands and so forth. Those are kind of things, not immorality. Hallelujah. So Paul say that to be mind it is death. Okay. Now I want us to to put denominations aside. We are talking about the bride. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because as we are going to see that Lucifer when he started b the battle in heaven His ambition has never changed and his ambition is always closed where God is. He is not in the bars in the in the wrong places for him. They are wrong places for him. Count him there. only what he does. He's always at the source where the life is. Now the devil is not there but he's here in the message. Hallelujah. And that's why the seals were open for the bride because the Bible said Jesus said that it will be closed that he could even deceive the evil. And remember the prophet said that Pentecostal or Protestants open the cost. Pentecostal they are going to be worse than the Catholics. So you don't you don't think that Pentecostals and all these denominations that they will deceive the bride. Not the denomination that will receive the will deceive the bride because Jesus said that it is very close very close. So it's right in the message. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see here that up and down we can be busy with our natural things, job and so on. Okay. And now here but the angel is telling us to be zealous. Hallelujah. And now also when you go in the book of revelation 17 verse 14 because there is something that God place in you. There is something precious that God placed in you and that is the power of decision. You can decide. At first I thought that I will talk about a subject called the inner circle bride. It is such a wonderful subject to talk about. You know with that power that God gave you, you can create a world and you live it. Hallelujah. So here you have decision. Everything is on on your table. You can decide to overcome. Hallelujah. Or you can decide to be overcome. Hallelujah. So here in Revelation 17:14, this shall make war with the lamb, and the lamb shall overcome them. For he is Lord of lords and King of kings. And they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful. [Music] Now, I want you to see something here at the end of this uh verse. He said that those that were with him, of course, we know that that's the bride are called and chosen. unfaithful. There are three things. And now we see here that called they are called the prophecy called by predestination chosen by election and faithful by their decisions. So you see that there is a part for us to play. There is this part destination is for God. Choosing is for God. But faithfulness is by our decision. So you see that you can decide, you have that power within. You can decide to be what you want to be. You either been in Revelation 4 or you been in chapter 3. And when you've been in Revelation chapter 3, you be a message believer still. Okay. Now, if you get time, you can read that message. is the masterpieces of And now we see that the prophet now came on the scene and then he preached the the message called the rapture. the rapture. And now at first I was thinking since he's preaching the rapture, he is going to go to Corinthians as the opening scripture. You know that then we who are remain then translated and called together. Hallelujah. Isn't that the rapture? But when you read uh the rapture, the prophet goes in Psalms chapter 27. And now remember I told you last time that everything it is not for just it has a meaning everything. Okay, let's go in chapter 27. Psalms. Psalms. It says that the Lord is my light. I think I can just read in English time. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is my strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though an host should come against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war shall raise should rise against me, in this will I be confident. H one thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that was the scripture for the rapture. And then you may think maybe you even do maybe you switch off the message because you may easily think maybe you may miss it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But what does the prophet say in the third seal? [Music] There is something that he warned us. He said sometimes when we just read that is uh paragraph 14. Sometimes when we just read and now be real careful and when you read get the taps listen to them real [Music] close very carefully because you can easily miss the whole thing like when the prophet came and preached the seven seals. and he was a bit demoralized and because he saw people didn't receive them the way he expected. And when he said now it is questions and answers all the questions they ask you even feel sorry for him like people didn't get until when he had until when God came and warned him and encouraged him and he showed him a vision of his ministry. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then he was encouraged. So you can easily miss it and many are missing it even today. Not in the Pentecostals, not in the denominations. Forget about them. The devil is not there is here. is at the source because the battle has never changed and his ambition has never changed and that's why the seals were open and the reason why they were open the bride had to know the false vein stripe naked [Music] there for you to be able overcome. And then there's also the true vain and of course that's the Lord Jesus. Okay? And his tactics have never changed since Jesus and since up in heaven. So they are the same same tactics. Same tactics and throughout the Bible and he will never change. So his ambition is to get to the throne of God because if that was not his ambition, maybe his ambition was to start his own kingdom. and once he got Cain in the Garden of Eden, he would have started the kingdom there. But once he got he left him, moved on. He went to Abel. From Abel, we see him continuing. And what he does, his ambition is to get you off. And then he leaves you. You go away. You go with the uh the desires of your flesh. They draw you. They take you further, but he's not with you. He's not for him. He's always on the source. You know, there's a brother who said that the devil looks at sometimes and he handers You can do this. Hallelujah. Amen. So that's those are the tactics of the devil. That's all that's what the seven sins were about. And we see that he rides the horse the the white horse. He rides the the red [Music] And the prophet say that he he he his target is not to stay on the white horse but those are just his tricks. From there he moves up to the pale horse which is death. And of course death it means total separation from God. meaning that the devil has completely taken over the throne. And I don't know why I'm going ahead of myself, but the throne of God, the prophet said, it was once in heaven and then in Exodus on Mount Sai, you know, Moses saw a vision of heaven, the temple of God in heaven. God told him make something like like that that you have seen in heaven. And then from there it was in Jesus Christ. Uh of course you know that Jesus Christ was the clay of the old testament. Hallelujah. So again now the throne is now in the bride. So the devil's plan the devil's battle it is to take the throne completely and he takes it by the pelvis but remember it starts very slowly. Hallelujah. Amen. So we see that uh the prophet say that now the bride is smitten. Do you know smiting something? It is you know she's smitten out of Amen. And now we are going to see here that the bread is smitten by what? There is a there is something that God has used mighty. Hallelujah. And the Lord has used the six seal. Okay? You know friends, I want you to know something. that we don't have any room within us as believers of the message to debate the word of God to debate the prophet and the prophet was never in error. But when you're reading the message, you can easily miss the link. And that's why you find the people saying why I left the message is because they missed something. Hallelujah. You know the prophet when he was preaching the seals and mainly when it comes to the seven seals when you're reading it is story stories understanding things. You see now for example the the disciples asked Jesus Christ what will be the time the saying of your when shall these things be and then he took them back to the seven seals to the seals the six seals Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when you you read in Matthew, you will see that he took roughly like five minutes explaining the six seals. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But how long did the prophet take? Of course. Now when we talk about the six, you'll find out this is just the the calling of 140,000 to witness the burning of the world basically. But he will take two hours. And he gets now he comes he says now now the six seal now 100 now 110,000 from goes back to some stories [Music] now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But everything is aligned very perfectly. Hallelujah. If you see Jesus his ministry when they could ask him a question we look at the woman at the well the way he replied her so ridiculous if you're not aligned very well said oh give me that call me your husband Is that an answer friend? Now they ask him when shall these things. Now he starts saying [Music] now they darken. Now hear the parable. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So there is something friends that was in the seals. that we need to get. Maybe you're here and you you are still missing it. Hallelujah. Because now the prophet say that now these seals and winds up the whole book, the whole book of redemption. But remember he said the six seals not seven seals. We're going to come to that. Why did he leave the because he said that in the six seals paragraph I didn't write the paragraph here. He says that now remember these are hidden mysteries and the six seals all together in one book. Just six scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption. That's how the whole earth is redeemed. And that's how you are also redeemed. So he said that the seeds open the book and then after preaching the seeds he said that now my Bible is my new book. Hallelujah. So after knowing that, don't you think you should read seals like four times? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You read, you finish. Now also, okay, let's read the second seal. paragraphs three. I'm going to read this to show you something that maybe will appetize you to go back. Maybe read them again. You see now when you look at the first seal, he's talking about deception, the white horse rider. Okay? But now he comes here you know, persecution of the church and like almost history long time. But now here what is his opening prayer in the second season. Now we pray father that you will come tonight and break this second seal for us. And as the poet has said that he would like to look past the curtain of time and that's our desire Lord is just to just to look past and see what lies ahead to see what lies ahead. Hallelujah. And we pray that the lamb that had been slain we will come among us now and break the seal and reveal it to us the things we have need. But I thought this is history, church history. But he is saying and that's our desire Lord is just to just to look past and see what lies ahead. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And now let's first go in the seals in this sixth seal because I say that this is the whip that God is using to smite his bride. And I say that don't doubt the prophet whatever he says just believe. Okay? At least say Lord may you give me revelation to understand this thing. You first put it aside because now when you start talking just know you under now the anointing of the horse rider the white horse rider. Now from there it goes now the red and continues until you die completely. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now I want to talk about you know the prophet say that the sixth seal reveals the seven. because you know that it remained a mystery and that's why he said that the six seals unwinds the book of redemption not seven. You may think I've left my title but I'm coming. I'm coming if time allow. Hallelujah. So we see that the seventh seal is within the sixth seal throughout the Bible from Genesis Revelation. But we could not see it until the prophet opens the reveals the seals. Hallelujah. By the grace of God, I will pick out some few characters in the Bible. As we go on, I will pick out some examples and then we see how did these seals what how did the seventh be revealed in the sixth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now we see 1960 19 60 1961 the prophet preaches Revelation chapter one chapter 2 chapter 3 chapter 4 and 1961 he's done with chapter 5 he's done with chapter five and then he put he put a pause there up to when you know God spoken to him. He knew when the time for revealing the seals when the time comes he will know God because God had spoken spoken. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see here was there then there are six dreams that came from the believers. And now all these six dreams in a row. And then the prophet said that they were all speaking the same thing. And they were speaking the six seals six. And now the prophet was just there seated somewhere in the room and then he got a vision of the seventh seal. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And now he says here he says in in the fifth seal if you just know what happened. What happened before we left there? You understand why six straight dreams come exactly with the vision? A dream interpreted is a vision. And now here is this the sign of the end sir. Six strange dreams. And then the vision kept kept it the vision that he got. And now what was that that was showing the ministry of brother mainly when you go in the sermons brother Brandham will mainly will many times talk about the dream of brother junior Jackson. Hallelujah. So we see that there were six dreams revealing the seventh. Hallelujah. Amen. So I I'll first put a pause there on the seals. Let's first go back to uh the Old Testament and then we link it with our chapter 4 Revelation because of time I may not finish. It's Exodus. Okay, I will not read it. Just write it down. Exodus 25. So Moses had seen a vision of the tabernacle in heaven. And now after the pattern of the tabernacle in heaven and then God told him to make the same thing. And then it had the outer court, the holy place, holy of holies, which is the innermost. Let me hope you're still opening your Let me hope you're still on your Psalms. Now you will understand why David here said, said that verse five that for in my time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his [Music] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon rock. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Remember that's a scripture for rapture. The church goes up in Revelation 4. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now the prophet here says, you can also note down numbers chapter 2. When you go in the details of how this tabernacle was made and you focus on the holy of holies that there was the ark of the convent glory. Hallelujah. And now I want you to see two things from this chapter here. Number one, uh the the arrangement of these tribes, the settlement around the is number two. You'll find it there. You can read it in your divided into three three and and the heads were carrying the banners, the heads of the tribe. And now we see Dan, Robin, Judah, and Ephra. Judah and I want you to see the directions. Hallelujah. We see that Dan was in the north. Robin was in the south. Judah in the east. Actually, Judah loves east so much. Even when you go in the book of Hosea, you see is talking about Judah. Isaiah talking about Judah coming from the east. Hallelujah. So we see that Judah in the east, Ephraim in the west. [Music] Okay. Now I want you to keep that in mind. In the inner circle there was the shakina glory two cherubams. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then the prophet comes and says that these four uh Dan uh Dan, Robin, Judah and Ephraim, Robin, Jud, you say that they were protecting, they were guarding the tabernacle. You cannot just come anyhow. But it was only the Levites that were around the tabernacle. Now you have the picture. In the north, south in the east, Judah, in the west, Ephraim. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want this is taking us back to our chapter 4. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Another thing that I want you to note there, I want you to note that uh to enter in the inner in the inner part or in the innermost you had to be qualified first. And the prophet says that you need to have some kind of perfumes, certain clothes. You know, you behave in a way. You have to have the blood. That's the sacrifice. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then the prophet comes and says, even in the Bible, it's there. that the perfume that they were using was got from uh from the rose of Shon. Yes. The rose of Shon the bright and morning star and that is our Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. So you've got to have those perfumes. If if you go with those things, you die. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see that Ezekiel also saw the same thing that Moses saw. Hallelujah. When you read Ezekiel 1, I think let's read that. 1 chapter 9 to 10 their wings. Okay, I'm starting in the middle the whole chapter one. [Music] from 9 to 10. Their wings were joined one to another. They turned not when they went. They went everyone straight forward. As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion. On the right side, I want you to remember the right side is the east and they four had the face of ox on the left side. That's the west Ephraim. They four also had the face of an eagle that is to the north and that's done. Hallelujah. Now from there I think we can continue with our chapter. You keep those things in mind. Revelation chapter 4. I still have few minutes to [Music] what it says. Okay, before we go to that, okay, it's fine. You can start from verse six. Say that. And before the throne, there was a sea of glass like unto Christ. And in the midst of the throne and round about the throne uh were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion. And the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man. And the fourth beast was like a a flying eagle. Can read brother. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now uh I I will not read all. Now we see we all know this chapter. Brother Muffin, you can give me Number [Music] three, we all know Revelation chapter 4. It talks about one that sat on the throne and the 24 elders around the throne and then the four beasts around the throne. Now the prophet told us that these beasts of revelation chapter 4 they are different from the beast in revelation chapter 7. This was an error in writing. No give me another one of the stars around there. So these are four living creatures not beast. [Music] Hallelujah. So we see that these beasts are doing the same work that Denim and Judah they were doing. in the Old Testament around the tabernacle. Protecting what? The tabernacle of God. Remember David prayed and said, "Lord, oh, I didn't give them to you in order." I think down of the stars. So we see that they are guarding and the prophecy that these are guards. They are guarding the tabernacle of God. I think we just leave the that's failed. So they are protecting the the the tabernacle. to go there. First of all, you've got to be the right person. And the right person, I mean, the Levite. And also to go there, you need to have uh the blood, the sacrifice. I need to have the perfumes. And now the perfumes I take them as the sixth seal. We are going to see if time allows. Now we see don't look don't see it as a church as okay bro you can just give me just give me that one that you had given I can just talk about that. So look at it as an individual, not a church, not denomination, but the bride. So we see that to leave Revelation chapter 3, to leave that condition, you need to be smitten. First of all, And those are the perfumes. Hallelujah. Of the Old Testament. And now another thing, you've got to have the sacrifice. And then another thing, you've got to be the right person. You need to have to be dressed in a certain way. Now, let's break those things. This evening, I have good news for you. I have good news for you that you are the right person. You're the Levite. How because those people to enter in the inner you need to be a priest and whether what does the Bible say? I've made you priests. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I don't know. I'm going ahead of myself, but it's fine. So we see that now the prophet says that these beasts that were guarding the tabernacle of the Old Testament. I think you are trying to connect something. It was done in the north. in the south, Ephraim in the west and Judah in the east. Ezekiel also testified of that Judah was in the east. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then he comes and says because they kind of three parts. The first part it was the old testament. and there are those tribes and now we have now the New Testament church that was started at the day of Pentecost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now the prophet say that Mark okay here it was not drawn very well. First of all, he says that four is a number of man. It's an earthly number of deliverance. And then he says uh also Jesus the duty of God was also manifested in four to be able to be human to come to our level. Hallelujah. as a king. The same person is a man. The same person is a servant. And yet he's God. Hallelujah. Is a little beautiful. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see that the prophet tells us that I wrote it where does he say it? It says the fourfold manifestations. Jesus Christ as a man, as a king, as a son, and as a son of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I wish you had seen the other picture, brother. Okay. Amen. It's okay. We can go on. So we see that uh brother Brham came in the New Testament and then he typed those four tribes with the four gospels of the church of Christ and now here it was not drawn very well but Matthew's in the east and that's Judah and now uh Robin, Luke, and then Mark the West, John in the north. Hallelujah. This is the wrong image. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now we see that these people, you can see it. These people, they all testified of our Lord Jesus Christ. They talked about Jesus. And there's a time when I ask myself, why is it that these gospels are the same? Why didn't they just delete the other ones? Then we read because you see what Matthew says, Mark repeats, uh, Luke repeats. But why it is because the same person remember Ezekiel say that these four beasts they having the same faces. They were the same. They going the same one direction away they go they don't look back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me keep my line. So now we see that Matthew he's talking about Jesus or he's expressing him as a king and then Mark is talking about him as a servant even if those gospels are the same but if you go you see there is a way how they bring their things Luke and Matthew is leaning on on the other side. The same Jesus but the king. And that's why you see it is the book of Matthew where you find the genealogy from David showing that he's a king. But Mark never recorded that. So, and they were with him. So, when you got the birth of Jesus Christ, you will see that Matthew talks about the wise men that brought the gifts. You know, of course, the prophet also talks about those gifts in details. Each gift presenting something And if you go to Matthew, you'll see Matthew never talked about Jesus's suffering, the real condition that and he said these wise men they knelt down and they worshiped they brought the gifts show him that he's a king. Hallelujah. And now there are many many many uh examples I not but I can pick out Luke. Luke he was mainly leaning towards the side of Jesus Christ being a man. Hallelujah. It is only the gospel of Luke that recorded uh Jesus [Music] sinking no sorry excuse me it is only Luke that omitted it but the rest reported about Jesus walking on What? What was Luke saying? Because sance is also speaking. Luke was trying to show that lean towards him being a man like us. Hallelujah. At Luke's gospel, you'll see Jesus as a compassionate friend. go and look at those stories. It is only Luke that recorded the story of the prodigal son. It is only Luke that's recorded the the story of the thief on the cross trying to show that he's the high priest touched by the feelings of our family that has been tested like how we have been tested regardless of your sins but he can still be merciful. Now I will also pull out John. John when you go in the book of John remember John is an eagle and the prophecy that that's the bride's gospel the bride age. When you got to John never talked about any parable. Why? It was speaking something. It was an open book already. Hallelujah. But when you go to other gospels, you'll see parables. Parables. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And also another thing about John. John didn't record miracles miracles here and there. And yet he was moving with him. Because in John we only see like seven uh miracles of which they are not real [Music] miracles but they were signs show him that he's a son of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And his main emphasis was he was putting it at the open book. And when you see John He was when you look at his gospel bonds some hard things. Hallelujah. So we ought to read the Bible in a different way. Hallelujah. And now we see that these gospels they were protecting also the tabernac of [Music] God the temple of God. The prophet said that that's the Acts, the book of Acts. That's the temple of God, the New Testament. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And that's how we ought to be restored back, back to the book of Acts. And that's why the prophet came and restored us back to the because that's the temple of God of the New Testament. And then when you go, you read Revelation chapter 4, the message, the sermon part three, the prophet talks about that in details. You can read it. It will it will enlighten. So we see that it was the book of Acts. And now because of time I see my time is running. I want us now to move it. We don't look at the church, but we look at you. And what does the prophet say? Oh, sorry. Put it here. I didn't put it here. Okay. Now, what does the prophet say? The prophet say that the throne of God, it is no long in heaven. Don't look I mean don't look at it as it is in heaven. Don't look at it as it's in in the Old Testament tabernacle. Don't look it at the New Testament church. But it's your heart right there. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And also science also testifies of the scriptures. Now he say that the heart is has four chambers and it and it is protected by 24 ribs testifying the 24 elders and the four beasts. Hallelujah is our God wonderful the nature testifies of him. Science testifies though they against him but sometimes by error they testify that everything testifies of him. Isn't he perfect? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I love the way how the scriptures do together and comes together. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I remember the story one time I was somewhere preaching to the Pentecostals mainly but they are mixed but when I realized that they are mixed up with Muslims I started by introducing the book because now the Muslim they may not want to hear this. But I told them that this is the only book that has been testified of that has been proven. And when you read this book, you will not find anywhere where the scriptures don't come together. The scriptures interpret themselves. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And it's the only book and it's the only book that was written was first to be written around if I'm not mistaken around 10 400 BC it was already being written. And now I told my Muslims friends, I told them that this book was written by men who moved with Jesus Christ, who slept with him, who ate with him, and who talked with him and who saw him. But now when you look at the uh the Quran, it was written 600 years. Hallelujah. So I told them, the person who wrote it, he was never there. He never saw Jesus. So I told them, how do you trust that book? What it is saying about Jesus? and then you don't trust this one. And then they didn't have what to say. So I told them your your book that you call Quran, you know, I read Quran also because of evangelism and the challenges. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I could quote them some there that they don't come together and then I I tell them you read the Bible and you find any scripture that is against but Quran itself it is against them. Hallelujah. Don't you love the Bible? Glory. So we see that he he's the high priest that is touched by the feelings of our that is what Luke said and remember for is the earthly number of deliverance prophets and the throne of God is right in the heart of a man and the heart of a man that is revelation 4. the whole of it. Read it. You'll see the heart of a man. I've told you that science testifies that Revelation 4 is the heart of a man. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I can see the time has really gone. Okay. I have not finished my subject because I told you that the bride is smitten out of LA by the hand of the sixth seal. But next time I will talk about that if God allows if I'm given another chance. May God bless [Applause] you brother shalom as he's coming let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you for the peace of your word that you have broken usord Father, we pray that may you find us when we are worthy. We see that this is the food for the bride and without this we are not perfect and without this we can't see Lord dear heaven father. We pray that may you come and take the throne. And Lord, may you be may we be worthy to go through that open door. And may we be welcomed by those guardians, the four living creatures. Lord, may we be worthy to go there by your love.
