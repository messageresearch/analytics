[3:40] I'd like to appreciate mother Martin for

[4:11] uh John chapter 1 verse one is
[4:17] in this service today I'd like you to
[4:19] really
[4:21] um
[4:23] put on like brother Barnum would say
[4:25] your spiritual thinking okay
[4:28] um
[4:37] in the beginning was the word and the
[4:40] Word was with God and the Word was God
[4:48] the same was in the beginning with God
[4:55] now I would like all of us to read verse
[4:57] 14 together
[5:01] let us start and the Word was made
[5:04] manifest
[5:06] and let us read it again and the Word
[5:09] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[5:14] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[5:18] only begotten of the father full of
[5:21] grace and truth
[5:23] so the word was made flesh
[5:26] is
[5:36] so in the beginning was
[5:45] God the word was
[5:49] so what is the word
[5:52] God is the one
[5:54] and verse 14 says
[5:58] and
[6:00] the word
[6:02] was made flesh
[6:05] so remember what is the word
[6:09] now I want you to to to to to read it
[6:13] that way and
[6:16] God katonda was made flesh
[6:22] so in other words
[6:24] Jesus yes was not some other man that
[6:29] came out of nowhere
[6:30] it was the word which was in the
[6:33] beginning with God
[6:35] and now was made flesh
[6:40] God bless
[6:44] so I'm going to speak to you on the
[6:46] subject of the unrecognized Christ
[6:52] on Wednesday brother brother
[6:55] Andrew spoke on recognizing your
[6:58] promises
[7:04] and so
[7:05] the word recognizing is coming again to
[7:08] us today
[7:11] when Jesus was before the birth of Jesus
[7:18] the Jews knew the prophecies about his
[7:22] birth
[7:26] the Jews believed in the Messiah
[7:30] the Jews believe the Messiah would be
[7:32] born
[7:34] and when the Messiah would come
[7:38] he would have several characteristics
[7:43] so they believed in the messiah's coming
[7:49] the prophecy
[7:53] one of the prophets and that is Isaiah
[7:57] in the book of Isaiah chapter 61 and you
[8:00] can turn it there today we are going to
[8:01] read quite a lot of scriptures so if you
[8:03] have your pain and and Bible you can
[8:05] knock those things down and and then go
[8:07] back to eat after retrogenes
[8:15] in verse 1 of 61 of Isaiah
[8:20] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[8:24] because the Lord has anointed me to
[8:26] preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has
[8:29] set me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[8:32] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[8:34] opening of the prison to them that
[8:36] abound
[8:37] tomorrow
[8:40] [Music]
[8:47] is
[9:08] now this prophecy was given by prophet
[9:10] Isaiah before the New Testament
[9:15] that the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[9:19] because he has anointed me to preach the
[9:21] Good Tidings unto the mix
[9:26] and this prophecy was speaking on the
[9:29] coming of Jesus
[9:31] who would have the spirit of God upon
[9:34] him
[9:37] sorry I would actually bind the uh we
[9:40] would actually bring Good Tidings to the
[9:42] make and ramacion
[9:45] he would bind the Brokenhearted
[9:49] Proclaim anybody to the captives
[9:53] this was the ministry of the Messiah
[9:57] if you understand that say Amen
[10:00] now in Isaiah
[10:02] is
[10:06] I want you to look at that prophecy
[10:08] again
[10:10] praise the name of the Lord
[10:18] For unto us a child is born and to us a
[10:21] son is given and the government shall be
[10:24] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[10:26] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[10:28] God the vasting Father the Prince of
[10:30] Peace
[10:48] now this prophecy was also given by
[10:51] Isaiah speaking on the coming of the
[10:54] Messiah
[10:57] are you following me
[11:00] you really have to say Amen in this
[11:02] service
[11:03] because if you don't you will does I can
[11:06] assure you
[11:06] know because you need to really put on
[11:10] your spiritual thinking okay
[11:24] this was the Messiah that was for to
[11:27] come on
[11:31] he says his name would be called
[11:33] wonderful
[11:37] the Mighty God the Everlasting father
[11:40] the Prince of Peace
[11:47] praise the name of the Lord now I want
[11:51] you to follow this
[11:52] the Jews had this scripts
[11:56] the Jews believe in the description
[12:21] because the Messiah was supposed to be
[12:25] nothing less than God because
[12:35] you know as I will show you in the Bible
[12:37] in the Book of John
[12:40] Jesus told them the Jews that he was a
[12:42] Son of God yes
[12:44] and they wanted to stun him immediately
[12:48] do you know the reason they gave him um
[12:59] he told them he was a Son of God
[13:02] but they claimed he said he was God
[13:06] because they knew to be a Son of God
[13:10] you had to be God himself
[13:15] are you following me this morning
[13:17] they read this scripture in their
[13:19] temples
[13:22] synagogues for years and years
[13:26] and on the day when Jesus was born
[13:34] all the priests
[13:38] they did not understand that the Messiah
[13:42] was born
[13:44] as a matter of fact only a few
[13:46] understood
[13:53] was one of them
[13:59] was one of them
[14:01] you know and we also find that the the
[14:04] Shepherds
[14:06] you know these were people who were
[14:08] despised
[14:09] the lowest of the people they are the
[14:13] ones who understood and recognize the
[14:15] birth of
[15:14] you see that this
[15:48] do you think they will recognize Christ
[15:50] today
[15:53] the religious men are acceptable not the
[15:56] Bishops back upon the mighty powerful
[15:59] the theologians you don't recognize
[16:02] Christ that way
[16:04] Christ reveals himself to Baby such as
[16:18] so you can be able to recognize Christ
[16:22] now we need to understand that the Word
[16:25] was God to take it into it
[16:28] so God was made flesh
[16:34] this is the most powerful Revelation in
[16:38] the Bible
[16:40] hallelujah amen even Jesus himself he
[16:44] said he's going to build his church
[16:48] on the revelation of Christ
[16:51] because Jesus one day asked his disciple
[16:53] foreign
[16:59] [Music]
[17:07] [Music]
[17:25] foreign
[19:00] and the word was
[19:04] foreign
[19:06] [Music]
[19:17] [Music]
[19:28] God is a spirit and they that worship
[19:30] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[19:33] truth is
[19:41] the name of the Lord God is
[19:48] the spirit moyo is like water Purina
[19:54] what is this chichino
[19:57] Mercy how many water amazing
[20:01] one water okay we will find out
[20:09] okay how many disagree
[20:13] it's all right it's okay to disagree
[20:15] do you see this is what is happening the
[20:19] religious world
[20:21] that confusion
[20:23] it is
[20:37] how many water is this
[20:39] if this is
[20:42] how many water is this
[20:46] what's this
[20:48] do you see the confusion
[20:52] the other one will even come one word
[20:57] will come and with red face yes and he
[21:00] will say no don't you have knowledge in
[21:02] your head don't take it yeah
[21:08] it is
[21:28] not one like your finger is
[21:33] that right it is more than one
[21:37] but not
[21:39] foreign
[23:07] but it is the same water
[23:43] where that water is
[23:45] [Music]
[23:47] and that is how the spirit is the Bible
[23:52] says God is a spirit
[23:54] you cannot count the spirit
[23:57] yes
[24:05] but how many is it
[24:08] same experience
[24:11] Hallelujah if that same spirit that
[24:15] raise Christ from the day
[24:18] [Music]
[24:25] [Music]
[24:30] it's not a different spirit it's the
[24:33] same same Spirit
[24:35] one day he came in a pillows
[24:40] one day he came and he says
[24:57] but he is
[25:15] believe in him
[25:18] do you understand that so God is a
[25:21] spirit he is uncountable
[25:23] when do now where do they get that idea
[25:28] that God is
[25:30] if God is a spirit so if if you are
[25:35] saying they are free are you saying we
[25:37] have three Spirits
[25:39] can you count spirits
[25:42] and then another one says no manager
[25:44] they are not free they're ready
[25:47] divided in three parts
[25:51] so is one divided in three parts
[25:55] one spot is
[26:04] so what about God the father in which
[26:07] form is
[26:16] confusion it's the same God who
[26:21] manifested himself in three different
[26:24] forms
[26:26] the Greek word is
[26:31] God changing his form
[26:38] God manifesting himself
[26:57] and you can never count him
[27:02] praise the name of the Lord
[27:05] hallelujah hallelujah now
[27:10] foreign
[27:26] foreign
[27:36] [Music]
[28:27] [Music]
[28:45] is a is the spirit but each of them
[28:50] is not the other one Buddhism
[29:00] each of them is
[29:46] that is the idea of God
[29:49] and that's called The Holy Trinity
[29:54] I will show you today from the Bible
[29:56] that is
[30:08] it is up
[30:10] and then there is another Doctrine which
[30:13] says oh
[30:15] you know Jesus is the father
[30:18] he just is the son Jesus is the holy
[30:21] spirit yes
[30:23] yes
[30:26] but if you've got to believe in that
[30:28] neighborhood then you have questions to
[30:30] answer which you can never answer or
[30:32] definitely moves
[30:34] why was Jesus praying in the on the
[30:38] mountains
[30:40] he was praying to who
[31:17] he is
[31:22] so there is something that you need to
[31:25] understand
[31:26] so the Oneness teaching is wrong
[31:31] and that's why they go ahead to baptize
[31:35] in the name of Jesus
[31:38] they actually they call them Jesus only
[31:40] people yes
[31:44] and I find that many Believers of this
[31:47] message actually don't understand that
[31:50] is
[31:54] our Prophet is telling us here but the
[31:58] trinitarians mixed it up
[32:01] and the Oneness people also mixed it up
[32:06] I said God is not one like your finger
[32:09] is one cartoon
[32:12] those two groups got it mixed up I've
[32:15] always had to never get married
[32:18] you can't make it either way
[32:23] brother make sure you put for me these
[32:25] quotes here this is a very sensitive
[32:27] subject
[32:29] now he says he was gone the manifested
[32:34] in a flesh
[32:36] of his creative foreign
[33:36] [Music]
[34:47] that is the same spirit
[35:34] who created everything
[35:39] foreign
[36:13] foreign
[36:25] these are all very wonderful nuggets but
[36:28] okay let's continue but every man in his
[36:30] own order verse 23 Christ the first
[36:32] fruits afterward they that are Christ is
[36:35] at his coming then cometh the end when
[36:38] shall when he shall have delivered up
[36:41] the kingdom to God even the father when
[36:45] he shall have put down all Rule and all
[36:48] authority and power for he Jesus must
[36:52] Reign till so there is an end to his
[36:55] reigning till he has put all enemies
[36:58] under his feet The Last Enemy that shall
[37:00] be destroyed is death for he has put all
[37:03] things under his feet but when he shall
[37:06] have all things uh when he shall when he
[37:09] says all things are put under him it is
[37:11] Manifest that he is expected which did
[37:13] put all things under him that is in
[37:16] Christ Jesus and when all things shall
[37:18] be subdued unto him the then shall the
[37:22] son
[37:23] also himself be subject unto him that
[37:28] put all things under him that God may be
[37:31] all in all

[1:04:10] in the message for the paganian church
[1:04:12] age
[1:04:14] John 1 1 where it says in the beginning
[1:04:16] was the word
[1:04:19] the root from which we get our
[1:04:21] translation for word is logos
[1:04:27] which means the thought or

[1:04:34] it has the double meaning of fault and
[1:04:37] speech
