[56:41] They already visited the home
[56:44] and um, I don't know everybody there,
[56:48] but I know sister

[57:20] Okay, give us the next picture.
[57:24] Okay, continue.
[57:27] All right. So, that was on June 6th,
[57:32] 2025.
[57:34] Amen. And I love the way they did their
[57:36] their ceremony. They did the the and
[57:40] introduction at the same time.
[57:44] It saves them a lot of money
[57:47] and I think it was a good thing that the
[57:49] parents agreed to.
[57:52] You can copy that style. I really loved
[57:54] it.
[57:55] Continue.
[57:58] That's brother Joseph and his brother
[57:59] there.
[58:01] All right.
[58:03] That's them.
[58:07] Have you seen them?
[58:11] Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Right over
[58:14] there.
[58:16] Yeah. I don't know whether he took all
[58:17] those drinks by himself.
[58:20] [Laughter]
[58:23] So, brother represented us and his wife
[58:27] and uh we we we want to thank them. So,
[58:31] God bless you. God bless you, brother
[58:33] Joseph. Before they go.
[58:36] So, he's saying that introduction was
[58:38] 6th. Of course, I've already announced
[58:39] that.
[58:41] So, the wedding is slated for 22nd
[58:43] November.
[58:47] Uno
[58:50] um the wedding since since I think I
[58:54] don't know why you are putting the venue
[58:55] since you have a few other details here.
[58:57] I think I'll not read the venue for that
[58:58] purpose. So he has a note here. It says
[59:00] that the church wedding ceremony is open
[59:03] for everyone to attend
[59:08] but for reception
[59:11] one is required to have an invitation
[59:13] card.
[59:16] [Music]
[59:22] You can come
[59:24] invited at church. So the card will be
[59:26] distributed towards the wedding.
[59:30] I think they will distribute to those
[59:32] that they want to be at
[59:38] but I should presume maybe those who
[59:39] will support them or their friends and
[59:41] family.
[59:43] [Music]
[59:45] Uh that's self-explanatory
[59:48] and they're saying contribution to
[59:50] support the wedding is on a free week.
[59:57] So if you want, give. If you don't want,
[59:59] it's all right.
[1:00:03] That's what free will means.
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:17] Anyways, that that is when you say
[1:00:19] directly.
[1:00:21] But but when you say politely,
[1:00:27] when you say it politely,
[1:00:30] they're trying to say
[1:00:32] all support is welcome.
[1:00:36] Every wedding, every marriage, we need
[1:00:38] to support them.
[1:00:41] Do we believe that
[1:00:44] they are ours? Let us stand with them.
[1:00:48] But they have their own arrangement.
[1:00:51] I heard they are not going to do
[1:00:53] meetings.
[1:00:55] They also not going to do WhatsApp
[1:00:56] groups.
[1:00:58] They they are ready to receive all your
[1:01:01] support.
[1:01:03] Free will.
[1:01:06] Is that is that understood? Brother
[1:01:08] Joseph, is that announced properly?
[1:01:12] God bless you all.
[1:01:15] Let us clap for them as they go back.
[1:01:18] Amen.
[1:01:22] [Applause]
[1:01:24] Amen.
[1:01:26] We happy to see when we see you know the
[1:01:28] young people getting married.
[1:01:32] We believe in marriage in the right way.
[1:01:37] Not just uh you know something you
[1:01:39] someone you find on the road and then
[1:01:41] you you you go get start a family.
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:45] It has to be done advisably
[1:01:49] and in the fear of God.
[1:01:52] Shall we stand on our feet?
[1:01:55] Um before I forget, we have a meeting
[1:02:00] um after the service.
[1:02:03] Uh the people who should not miss in
[1:02:05] that meeting are
[1:02:08] group team leaders
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:13] and those people who have been uh also
[1:02:15] on the committee for the youth meetings
[1:02:20] and church members who really feel that
[1:02:23] they they part of what we are doing.
[1:02:26] [Music]

[1:06:05] Amen.
[1:06:07] This is what Christianity is all about.
[1:06:11] It's about redemption.
[1:06:15] Amen.
[1:06:18] We are reading uh we we we read last
[1:06:21] Sunday we read up to verses seven
[1:06:25] and I think we are going to read up to
[1:06:27] verses 10.
[1:06:30] There are many many things. Yes. I I I
[1:06:32] that I never really got to touch on on
[1:06:34] Sunday
[1:06:36] and by God's grace I hope that today we
[1:06:38] will be able to get into some
[1:06:45] and I saw I'm reading from verses one
[1:06:51] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:06:52] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:06:54] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:06:56] seals.
[1:07:07] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:07:09] with a loud voice, who is worthy to open
[1:07:12] the book, and to lose the seals thereof?
[1:07:14] And no man in heaven, nor in earth,
[1:07:16] neither under the earth, was able to
[1:07:18] open the book, neither to look their
[1:07:19] own.
[1:07:38] and I wept much because no man was found
[1:07:40] worthy to open the book, to read the
[1:07:43] book, neither to look their own.
[1:07:52] And one of the elders said unto me, weep
[1:07:55] not. Amen. I love this part. Weep not.
[1:08:00] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[1:08:03] the root of David has prevailed to open
[1:08:07] the book and to lose the seven seals
[1:08:08] thereof.
[1:08:21] Amen.
[1:08:23] Tell your neighbor, don't cry. Amen.
[1:08:27] Amen. And I beheld and lo in in the
[1:08:30] midst of the throne and in the and in
[1:08:32] and and of the four beasts. And in the
[1:08:34] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:08:37] had been slain, having seven horns and
[1:08:40] seven eyes, which are the seven spirits
[1:08:42] of God sent forth into all the earth.
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:02] And he came and took the book out of the
[1:09:04] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:09:06] throne.
[1:09:13] He alone was worthy.
[1:09:16] And when he had taken the book, the four
[1:09:17] beasts and four and 20 elders fell down
[1:09:20] before the lamb, having every one of
[1:09:21] them haps and golden vials full of
[1:09:23] orders, which are the prayers of the
[1:09:25] saints.
[1:09:39] And they sang a new song, saying, Thou
[1:09:41] art worthy to take the book and to open
[1:09:43] the seals thereof. And for thou was
[1:09:45] slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy
[1:09:47] blood out of the every kindred and
[1:09:49] tongue and people and nation.
[1:10:06] and has made us unto our God, kings and
[1:10:09] priests. And we shall reign on earth
[1:10:18] and we shall reign on the earth.
[1:10:22] How many believe that? Say amen.
[1:10:25] Amen. Please be seated.
[1:10:28] Um this morning I am dealing with uh
[1:10:32] really the title has not changed our
[1:10:34] true origin but I'm dealing with the
[1:10:36] grace met the requirement of the law.
[1:10:51] Grace
[1:10:53] met the requirement of the law or the
[1:10:55] law's requirement.
[1:11:17] The Bible says, "The soul that sinnth,
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:21] that soul shall die."
[1:11:26] What is death?
[1:11:28] Death is total separation with God.
[1:11:35] Amen.
[1:11:36] Death is total separation with God.
[1:11:41] So now the soul that sinnth
[1:11:45] is the soul that that refuses to take
[1:11:49] God at his word.
[1:11:54] when God created Adam and and Eve.
[1:11:59] The Bible says he created them in his
[1:12:01] image
[1:12:03] in his image created he them
[1:12:09] male and female
[1:12:11] created he them.
[1:12:14] So now Adam, Adam was in the image of
[1:12:18] God,
[1:12:20] was in the likeness of God.
[1:12:23] Adam was like God.
[1:12:26] Because you see, God was a spirit.
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:30] God is a spirit.
[1:12:32] John 4 24. The Bible says, "God is a
[1:12:37] spirit.
[1:12:38] They that worship him must worship him
[1:12:42] in spirit. and in truth. So you cannot
[1:12:45] worship God in the flesh.
[1:12:49] That's why in in in chapter four, God
[1:12:51] tells John, come up hither.
[1:12:55] There is a certain level of revelation
[1:12:59] you have to be at
[1:13:02] to be able to worship God,
[1:13:05] to be able to understand God.
[1:13:08] Otherwise, if you are in the flesh,
[1:13:10] you can never understand God.
[1:13:13] You need to enter into the spirit.
[1:13:17] Things of the spirit are understood in
[1:13:19] the spirit.
[1:13:22] That's why in John chapter 3,
[1:13:26] you know Jesus told Nicodemus.
[1:13:28] You must be born again.
[1:13:33] It is a must for you to be born again.
[1:13:37] He says that which is born of flesh is
[1:13:39] flesh
[1:13:41] and that which is born of spirit is
[1:13:46] why do you marvel that I tell unto you
[1:13:48] that you must be born again
[1:13:51] because to be able to understand God
[1:13:55] and you cannot worship God unless you
[1:13:57] understand him
[1:13:59] but the kind of understanding I'm
[1:14:01] talking about
[1:14:02] I'm talking about the uh knowing who he
[1:14:06] is
[1:14:08] and you receive that understanding by
[1:14:10] the revelation which comes from God.
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:16] So you cannot have that fellowship with
[1:14:18] God
[1:14:21] unless you are in the spirit.
[1:14:25] You should you should not know Jesus
[1:14:27] after the flesh.
[1:14:30] You should know him after the spirit.
[1:14:34] The problem we have with Christianity,
[1:14:37] many people know God after the flesh,
[1:14:41] but you must know him after the spirit.
[1:14:44] There are many people that were with
[1:14:46] Jesus
[1:14:48] and they touched him. They fell,
[1:14:50] but they did not understand
[1:14:54] who Jesus was. They did not have a
[1:14:57] revelation
[1:14:58] of who Jesus was. Amen. And you know
[1:15:01] even Jesus himself asked them who the
[1:15:04] people say that I the son of man are
[1:15:08] and then they began to say some say you
[1:15:10] are Elijah or you are Moses or you are
[1:15:13] you know one of the prophets but then he
[1:15:15] said what about you? So even I ask you
[1:15:17] this morning what about you? Who do you
[1:15:21] say that this Jesus is?
[1:15:23] Who do you say this message is?
[1:15:27] You know, and Peter was in the flesh and
[1:15:30] he was seeing Jesus. Maybe he was close
[1:15:33] with you, but something happened to him
[1:15:36] in that moment. Something struck you and
[1:15:40] revelation hit you.
[1:15:42] Hallelujah. You know, when revelation
[1:15:44] hits you, you receive, you get
[1:15:47] stimulated.
[1:15:50] These things that I'm getting into are
[1:15:51] really very delicious.
[1:15:53] So, you have to be appetized to hear
[1:15:54] them.
[1:15:56] Amen. So when revelation hits you, you
[1:16:00] get stimulated and the stimulation you
[1:16:03] receive
[1:16:04] becomes like the stimulation that a
[1:16:06] drunkard has.
[1:16:12] When someone drinks alcohol,
[1:16:15] even when they were humble,
[1:16:17] it hits them and then they begin to feel
[1:16:21] very happy. Are you drunk?
[1:16:25] something happened to them. They they
[1:16:28] stimulated from the inside and it comes
[1:16:31] on their flesh.
[1:16:34] That's that's a natural drunk command.
[1:16:37] But it is the same same thing. You are
[1:16:40] spiritual drunk man.
[1:16:42] When revelation hits you, you will
[1:16:45] behave like a naturally drunk man.
[1:16:50] You get excited. You begin shouting. You
[1:16:53] begin rejoicing, you begin, they say,
[1:16:56] "What's wrong with you?" That's why on
[1:16:58] the day of Pentecost, when they were
[1:17:00] drunk, they began speaking in tong. They
[1:17:03] began getting excited. They jumped up
[1:17:05] and down. And they said, "What is wrong
[1:17:06] with these people? Are they drunk at
[1:17:08] this early hour in the morning?" And
[1:17:11] then Peter jumped up. He said,
[1:17:13] "Hallelujah." Hallelujah. Amen. Let me
[1:17:15] tell you people these people are not
[1:17:17] drunk with
[1:17:19] even as he supposed but they are drunk
[1:17:22] with the spirit.
[1:17:24] So which means when you drink in the
[1:17:27] spirit
[1:17:29] when you come when you enter into the
[1:17:31] realm of the spirit
[1:17:34] where you begin to understand God
[1:17:37] there is no way you can remain sober.
[1:17:41] You become spiritually drunk.
[1:17:45] You become excited in your soul that it
[1:17:49] will even show on your body.
[1:17:52] That's why sometimes people begin to
[1:17:53] shake. You begin to shout. People begin
[1:17:57] to run around. Sometimes they fall.
[1:18:00] What's happening? They drown.
[1:18:03] And let me tell you, you need to
[1:18:05] understand that. You need to come into
[1:18:07] that realm. But if you are in the flesh,
[1:18:11] even if you're sitting around a table
[1:18:14] where men are drinking, but if you are
[1:18:17] in the flesh and you are seeing the
[1:18:20] drink, but you are not touching the
[1:18:23] drink,
[1:18:25] let me tell you, you will be in the
[1:18:27] flesh.
[1:18:30] You won't understand why they're
[1:18:31] behaving the way they behave.
[1:18:34] But let me tell you, brother, sister,
[1:18:36] touch, they drink, they drink.
[1:18:39] you will behave the same way.
[1:18:42] That's what happened. So let us now
[1:18:45] begin to soar up into the realm of the
[1:18:47] spirit this morning
[1:18:49] and we see what can happen in our own
[1:18:53] individual lives.
[1:18:55] Praise the name of the Lord. So God is a
[1:18:57] spirit. You need to enter into the
[1:18:59] spirit to understand God. And we see uh
[1:19:03] you know this man called Peter.
[1:19:06] You know as Jesus asked him what about
[1:19:08] you? What do you say about me? And Peter
[1:19:12] entered into that room
[1:19:14] and then maybe he must have Jack.
[1:19:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thou art at
[1:19:19] Christ the son of the living God. No
[1:19:23] natural man could say that.
[1:19:27] For Peter to say that he meant that
[1:19:30] Jesus is God in flesh.
[1:19:36] Who could say that? Everybody saw him as
[1:19:39] a prophet. Everybody saw him as a son of
[1:19:41] Mary. Everybody saw him as a son of
[1:19:44] Joseph. Others saw him as B. Other saw
[1:19:48] him as a confer.
[1:19:50] We talked we talked about that already.
[1:19:53] Others said you have a demon.
[1:19:55] Others they said you are even the head
[1:19:57] of God.
[1:19:59] Others they said you you deserve to die.
[1:20:02] And the best of them, they saw him only
[1:20:05] as a prophet.
[1:20:08] But Peter drunk of the spirit of
[1:20:12] revelation.
[1:20:14] He said, "You are Jesus Christ,
[1:20:17] the son of the living,
[1:20:19] not the son of man."
[1:20:22] Notice Jesus asked them, "Who do they
[1:20:25] say that I the son of man am?"
[1:20:30] Son of man and son of God are different.
[1:20:35] Son of man means a prophetic ministry.
[1:20:40] A man, a prophet can only be a human
[1:20:42] being, a man.
[1:20:45] But son of God is higher than son of
[1:20:48] man.
[1:20:51] Son of God is God himself
[1:20:55] in human flesh.
[1:20:57] So now Jesus asked them, "What about
[1:21:00] you? Who do you say that I the son of
[1:21:02] man are?"
[1:21:05] So Peter entered another realm,
[1:21:08] another dimension.
[1:21:10] And he saw what others could not see.
[1:21:14] And he said, "Haha,
[1:21:16] you are Jesus Christ, the son of God."
[1:21:22] And Peter said, and Jesus answered them.
[1:21:24] He said, Peter, flesh and blood
[1:21:29] has not revealed this,
[1:21:32] my father in heaven. Where is heaven?
[1:21:36] Heaven is a dimension.
[1:21:39] Peter was on earth, but he had entered
[1:21:42] into that dimension
[1:21:44] right on earth. And he said, "My father
[1:21:48] in heaven has revealed me." Hallelujah.
[1:21:51] Open your eyes.
[1:21:53] And now you know who I am. And he said,
[1:21:56] "Therefore, I will tell you, Peter, upon
[1:21:59] this rock, upon this revelation,
[1:22:02] the revelation that only if you enter
[1:22:04] into the realm of God,
[1:22:08] you can receive
[1:22:10] upon this revelation
[1:22:13] who I am." Amen. I will build my church.
[1:22:17] And the church of Jesus is built upon
[1:22:20] the revelation
[1:22:22] of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:24] Jesus is not a man only. He was more
[1:22:27] than a man. Jesus was not only a
[1:22:30] prophet. He was more than a prophet. Who
[1:22:33] is Jesus? Jesus is God himself
[1:22:37] in human flesh.
[1:22:40] Hallelujah. Amen. Can we go a step
[1:22:42] higher? Can we go a step higher?
[1:22:45] Jesus spoke to them and he said, "Ye are
[1:22:48] gods."
[1:22:51] Now the Bible says, "Amen. Now are we
[1:22:55] the sons of God,
[1:22:58] not the sons of men, but the sons of
[1:23:01] God." And he says, "It does not yet
[1:23:04] appear
[1:23:06] what we shall be, how we shall look, but
[1:23:10] where he come, we we we are sons of God.
[1:23:15] shall be like him.
[1:23:18] So in the same way today I can say the
[1:23:21] same thing that who are the sons of God?
[1:23:25] Those who have received the revelation
[1:23:28] of who they are.
[1:23:30] Amen. Now if you receive the revelation
[1:23:34] that you are a son of God, you cannot
[1:23:37] walk in this world as a defeated person.
[1:23:43] Are you hearing Sister Grace? Grace,
[1:23:46] even if things are hard,
[1:23:49] even if you know the tr the what you
[1:23:52] call facts,
[1:23:54] you know, let me tell you, a son of God
[1:23:57] does not rely on facts,
[1:24:01] a son of God does not speak facts,
[1:24:04] a son of God does not look at facts.
[1:24:08] A son of God looks at truth,
[1:24:12] speaks truth, Jesus said, "Who among you
[1:24:16] here can condemn me of sin?
[1:29:44] was no longer allowed.
[1:29:58] Look at you.
[1:32:23] Christ in me. That is my only hope.
[1:32:28] That's my only hope of glory.
[1:32:31] Christ revealed in me.
[1:32:34] So when brother Bam preaches
[1:32:36] Christ is the mystery of God revealed,
[1:32:39] he's not talking about Jesus of 2,000
[1:32:41] years ago.
[1:32:44] He's talking about Amen. that Christ
[1:32:46] today
[1:32:48] revealed in you.
[1:32:51] When he's in you,
[1:32:53] God is revealed.
[1:32:56] Meaning you a God
[1:33:00] today when you are redeemed. Hallelujah.
[1:33:04] Amen.
[1:33:06] How was Adam before the fall?
[1:33:10] Before he went onto the other side of
[1:33:11] the castle.
[1:33:14] When he was on this side of the castle
[1:33:19] before the fall, he was just like God.
[1:33:25] Same power, same authority.
[1:33:28] You understand? in the image, in the
[1:33:31] power. His word was as good as God.
[1:33:36] So he was the mystery of God revealed.
[1:33:41] He was God on earth. And when Jesus
[1:33:44] came, he confirmed the same thing.
[1:33:47] He told the Jews doesn't the Bible say
[1:33:51] that ye are God.
[1:33:53] Now when the fall came
[1:33:56] that mystery was he
[1:33:59] no man
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:02] came even close to that glory.
[1:34:06] The Bible says we have all sinned
[1:34:10] and come short
[1:34:12] of the glory of God.
[1:34:15] Why? Because we are born in sin.
[1:34:18] Not because we did something bad.
[1:34:22] Who is a sinner?
[1:34:23] is not the person who has done something
[1:34:25] bad.
[1:34:28] That's why sin is not adultery,
[1:34:29] fornication, smoking, drinking and all
[1:34:31] these things
[1:34:36] because even the person who has never
[1:34:38] done those things
[1:34:41] as long as born by a woman
[1:34:44] is a sinner.
[1:34:47] So what is sin? Sin, amen, is if you are
[1:34:52] born of a woman,
[1:34:56] you came to the world
[1:34:58] speaking lies, you are you came short of
[1:35:01] the glory
[1:35:04] because you did not believe.
[1:35:07] Adam did not believe by and Eve did not
[1:35:10] believe by obeying what Satan said
[1:35:15] and living what God said. And from that
[1:35:18] day Adam and all his lineage
[1:35:22] were sinners.
[1:35:24] We were not there
[1:35:27] physically but we were there in Adam.
[1:35:32] So because of that we were all born on
[1:35:34] the other side of the castle
[1:35:38] in sin clouded with sin
[1:35:41] come short of the glory of God
[1:35:44] filled with ammonia
[1:35:47] not knowing who we are
[1:35:49] filled with regrets
[1:35:51] filled with problems poverty sickness
[1:35:56] suffering trouble that's what this other
[1:35:59] died
[1:36:01] introduced to us
[1:36:06] so bad that man that is supposed to be
[1:36:10] God on earth
[1:36:12] was born
[1:36:15] and we begin to think that this is who
[1:36:18] we are.
[1:36:20] When the devil tells you go and
[1:36:22] fornicate
[1:36:24] the body agrees
[1:36:26] you say it's all right. You think that's
[1:36:28] what you are?
[1:36:31] Go to the disco.
[1:36:33] You just go willingly.
[1:36:36] Go and put on makeup.
[1:36:39] Dress skimpy clothes.
[1:36:41] Do this and that. Young man
[1:36:49] and then he
[1:36:52] Why? Because you're born confused.
[1:36:56] you you forgot who you are.
[1:36:59] Amen. Legalism
[1:37:02] cannot remind you who you are.
[1:37:06] It takes you deeper in jail.
[1:37:11] And then you come to church fearing they
[1:37:13] may see me and they will judge me.
[1:37:16] They will see me and condemn.
[1:37:19] We are not condemners.
[1:37:21] We are not here to judge you.
[1:37:23] We are here to remind you where you are.
[1:37:25] Hallelujah.
[1:37:28] We are here to remind you who you are.
[1:37:32] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:37:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are here to
[1:37:37] remind you. You have not always been
[1:37:39] that way. There is a better life.
[1:37:44] Where is that better life? That life is
[1:37:47] in a place where you were supposed to
[1:37:49] be.
[1:37:52] But sin separated you.
[1:37:55] But thank God through Jesus Christ, we
[1:37:59] have been redeemed.
[1:38:02] We have been redeemed back.
[1:38:04] Redemption
[1:38:06] is not forgiveness.
[1:38:08] You did nothing to begin with.
[1:38:11] Redemption is to remind you who you are.
[1:38:15] What were you in the mind of God? You
[1:38:20] were perfect.
[1:38:21] In the mind of God, you have never
[1:38:24] sinned in the in the mind of God. You
[1:38:28] have been in the image of God.
[1:38:31] Your word is as good as it was. In the
[1:38:34] mind of God, you had the glory.
[1:38:38] But sin blocked you.
[1:38:41] But after Jesus died,
[1:38:43] I will tell you what happened. Amen.
[1:38:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. by the bleach of
[1:38:48] the blood
[1:38:50] removed everything
[1:38:53] and now an entrance has been ministered.
[1:38:57] So you cannot be denied.
[1:39:00] You cannot be denied entrance.
[1:39:03] If you if you want to leave to live
[1:39:04] holy,
[1:39:06] you can't be denied anymore.
[1:39:08] If you want to break out of that,
[1:39:12] you cannot be denied.
[1:39:16] Amen.
[1:39:18] If you want to live for,
[1:39:20] if you want to overcome the world, if
[1:39:23] you want to overcome the world,
[1:39:25] if you want to be like a child of God,
[1:39:28] you cannot be denied
[1:39:31] today.
[1:39:33] Anyone
[1:39:35] enter
[1:39:37] the Holy of Holies
[1:39:39] and test of the grace.
[1:39:42] Grace met me.
[1:39:44] grace met what the Lord desired.
[1:39:50] Hallelujah. Amen. That this is the
[1:39:54] message of the hour.
[1:39:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the name
[1:39:59] of the Lord.
[1:40:01] Amen. He is just so lovely.
[1:40:05] Very very lovely. And they sang a new
[1:40:08] song.
[1:40:09] I will not go back in in from vers five
[1:40:12] we from verses one we talked about on
[1:40:13] Sunday
[1:40:17] but maybe I can rehearse a little bit
[1:40:18] for those who are not here and here was
[1:40:20] a book from the moment Adam sinned
[1:40:25] the moment Adam sinned listen carefully
[1:40:28] the authority that he had
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:33] that he had
[1:40:35] the glory that he had
[1:40:38] is the The Bible calls it a sevensealed
[1:40:41] book.
[1:40:46] A title did
[1:40:49] the book of redemption.
[1:40:53] When Adam sinned,
[1:40:55] all those things he fored it.
[1:41:00] And Satan was watching while Adam was
[1:41:04] losing his title. did.
[1:41:08] But suddenly his hands were filthy.
[1:41:14] So he could not take the book.
[1:41:16] He could not put his hands that hands on
[1:41:18] the book.
[1:41:21] Therefore, Satan does not possess the
[1:41:24] book.
[1:41:26] He possesses what belongs to you,
[1:41:30] but he doesn't have the authority.
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:34] Okay, let me put it this way. He has
[1:41:36] your land,
[1:41:38] but he doesn't have the title deed.
[1:41:43] He has your joy, but he doesn't have
[1:41:45] your the title to heal.
[1:41:49] He has your healing.
[1:41:51] He's cap capturing you in chains of
[1:41:54] sickness. is capturing you, you know, in
[1:41:58] chains of defeat
[1:42:00] until you get into certain kinds of
[1:42:02] addictions
[1:42:04] and the devil tells you you you better
[1:42:06] accept you are like this
[1:42:10] and then you also begin to agree
[1:42:14] for us we are poor
[1:42:16] accepted we are poor
[1:42:19] in our home we cannot get rich in our
[1:42:23] home we can
[1:42:25] probably
[1:42:26] They me
[1:42:29] that is what people are involved in.
[1:42:34] No wonder they move around all churches
[1:42:36] to break curses.
[1:42:42] What is what are they seeking for? They
[1:42:45] are seeking for the lost glory.
[1:42:48] But no church has your lost glory.
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:55] that only one is worthy and that the
[1:42:58] lamb,
[1:43:00] the lamb of God, his name is Jesus.
[1:43:05] Amen. He was only one worthy.
[1:43:09] Amen. They go here to try and restore
[1:43:11] the glory.
[1:43:13] But no one can restore the glory.
[1:43:16] And others in the process
[1:43:18] decide to accept
[1:43:20] they are born that way. There is nothing
[1:43:23] they can do about it. I am here in the
[1:43:25] name of the Lord to tell you. There is
[1:43:27] something you can do about it.
[1:43:31] Do not accept defeat.
[1:43:34] Amen. Hallelujah. No retreat. No
[1:43:37] surrender.
[1:43:41] I say no retreat.
[1:43:43] No surrender.
[1:43:46] You better say, "I will fight until the
[1:43:51] last drop of my blood."
[1:43:53] But I can assure the devil, he will
[1:43:56] never see the last drop of my blood.
[1:44:00] Meaning he cannot finish me
[1:44:02] because he has already seen the last
[1:44:05] drop of the blood of my savior.
[1:44:11] [Applause]
[1:44:12] Amen. Don't accept defeat.
[1:44:16] Amen. You run away. Run away from that
[1:44:19] evil, that burden that easily beset you.
[1:44:24] Well, if you can't run,
[1:44:26] someone said, "If you can't run,
[1:44:28] you can at least walk and walk in the
[1:44:31] right direction.
[1:44:33] If you can't walk, when are you going to
[1:44:36] die? You going to give up? Don't give
[1:44:38] up, brother. At least grow.
[1:44:41] Do something.
[1:44:43] but go to the right direction.
[1:44:47] Amen. Amen. And the book could not go in
[1:44:50] the dirt hands of Satan.
[1:44:53] Satan may have what belongs to you,
[1:44:56] but he doesn't have the authority to
[1:44:58] eat.
[1:45:02] So now the book could not go to Satan.
[1:45:07] He couldn't return to Adam
[1:45:10] because Adam was now a sinner.
[1:45:13] So the book went back to the original
[1:45:16] owner,
[1:45:18] the giver of it,
[1:45:21] God himself.
[1:45:24] And now the Bible says, "And I saw in
[1:45:26] the right hand of heaven
[1:45:29] sat on the throne. I saw a book
[1:45:33] written within on the back side
[1:45:36] filled with seven seals."
[1:45:39] And I I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:45:42] with a loud voice,
[1:45:46] "Who is worthy?"
[1:45:48] And you know that challenges to to
[1:45:49] everybody in heaven and everybody on
[1:45:51] earth.
[1:45:54] Who is worthy to open the book or to
[1:45:57] lose the seals
[1:45:59] there? No man in heaven, nor in earth
[1:46:03] made under the earth was able to open
[1:46:08] that loop thereon.
[1:46:10] And John wept much because he understood
[1:46:14] the human race was dumped.
[1:46:18] There is nobody able to redeem him
[1:46:21] from the fallen race
[1:46:24] to the fallen side
[1:46:26] back again into the glory. Amen. And
[1:46:29] John wept much because there was no one
[1:46:31] found worthy to
[1:46:33] read a book neither to God.
[1:46:36] But you see as he was weeping we found
[1:46:38] this on Sunday
[1:46:40] voice spoke to him from one of the
[1:46:43] elders.
[1:46:44] And we noticed that this elder was
[1:46:46] actually John himself.
[1:46:49] So you see it was a revelation he
[1:46:52] received
[1:46:53] and I said John spoke to John
[1:46:57] right and said weep not
[1:47:00] weep not you see
[1:47:04] it's not an angel going to come and tell
[1:47:05] you
[1:47:08] even as I'm preaching to you you
[1:47:11] yourself amen if you a son of God in the
[1:47:16] mind of God the
[1:47:18] When you hear the word,
[1:47:21] something in you
[1:47:23] is quickened.
[1:47:26] It begins leaping.
[1:47:28] It begins jumping.
[1:47:30] You begin to feel excitement.
[1:47:32] You begin to feel something.
[1:47:36] Yes. That's why you are here. That's why
[1:47:39] you keep coming. That's why you keep
[1:47:41] coming regardless of the things that
[1:47:44] distract you. Because there is something
[1:47:46] in you
[1:47:48] that is saying yes.
[1:47:52] Amen. And something in John said weep
[1:47:55] not
[1:47:59] I can almost hear something in me saying
[1:48:03] weep not
[1:48:06] weep not. Oh can I preach to you for a
[1:48:09] moment? It doesn't matter what you're
[1:48:11] going through.
[1:48:14] That voice of God speaking to you.
[1:48:18] It's not a time of weeping.
[1:48:20] It's not a time of crying. It's a time
[1:48:23] of you realizing who you are.
[1:48:26] Don't feel sorry for yourself.
[1:48:32] Stop being in that condition.
[1:48:35] Come to a place of realizing you know
[1:48:39] what I am not born to be this.
[1:48:44] I am born to be a child of God.
[1:48:48] Like that little eagle,
[1:48:50] you know the story of the little eagle.
[1:48:53] She was born under a hen.
[1:48:57] A farmer went and picked an egg and put
[1:49:01] the egg under
[1:49:03] the the chicken.
[1:49:06] And when the chicken hatched the eggs,
[1:49:09] all of them
[1:49:11] were cheeks
[1:49:14] apart from one which look different.
[1:49:18] He kept wondering.
[1:49:20] Everybody was scratching.
[1:49:24] But for for for it she couldn't scratch.
[1:49:28] She felt different. It's like as if
[1:49:32] there is something inside you that told
[1:49:34] it you are not born to scratch.
[1:49:38] You are born to fly high
[1:49:40] and you are born to take a fresh
[1:49:44] but he did not know how
[1:49:46] because it never never understood why it
[1:49:49] was born this way.
[1:49:52] But one day, Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[1:49:55] mother eagle came.
[1:49:57] And as mother eagle came
[1:50:00] squaring the whole place,
[1:50:03] and began calling,
[1:50:05] calling all the other chicks.
[1:50:10] They heard the cry of the mother hand,
[1:50:15] hide, hide for your life.
[1:50:18] Hide for your life. Because in the in
[1:50:20] the chicken family,
[1:50:24] ego is an enemy.
[1:50:28] Hide for your life.
[1:50:30] So every chick if you have ever seen
[1:50:33] them, they will hide in a split of a
[1:50:36] second
[1:50:40] and mother will be there
[1:50:43] trying to make himself
[1:50:46] even when he's nothing.
[1:50:49] Denominations are nothing.
[1:50:52] They have nothing for you. The vitamins
[1:50:55] you have.
[1:50:57] Mother ego has them.
[1:51:01] Hallelujah. I'm so glad you brought me
[1:51:05] out. I cannot go back there. I have
[1:51:09] realized who I am. I am not a chick
[1:51:11] anymore. I am an eagle. I am born to
[1:51:16] fly.
[1:51:18] Amen. Amen. And as mother eagle was
[1:51:20] coming, he said, "Hey, hey, Junior, what
[1:51:24] are you doing there?"
[1:51:26] And and at the same time, Junior was
[1:51:29] just there, Junior Eagle, and Mother
[1:51:32] Chicken was saying, "My boy,
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:41] I can't understand that. Why do I have
[1:51:43] to hide from a voice that sounds
[1:51:46] familiar?
[1:51:48] Hallelujah.
[1:51:50] Yes, sir. When you heard the message,
[1:51:54] it sounded familiar to you.
[1:51:58] Something in you
[1:52:00] told you that is the truth.
[1:52:04] Hallelujah. I mean in your denomination,
[1:52:07] they were telling you, "Run away. That's
[1:52:09] false. Run away. Run away. That's a
[1:52:12] cult.
[1:52:14] False religion. They are worshiping men.
[1:52:17] But something in you told you
[1:52:20] no. I can feel the connection.
[1:52:24] I don't see a cow here. I see the
[1:52:27] worship of the Holy True Lord
[1:52:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:52:33] And mother ego kept calling. I know
[1:52:36] mother ego will keep calling.
[1:52:39] The Bible says I am at the door and I
[1:52:41] know
[1:52:43] he that hears
[1:52:45] and open for me. I will come in. I will
[1:52:50] feast with him and he with me. Father
[1:52:53] Eagle is calling on your heart
[1:52:57] and he called on us. I don't know where
[1:52:59] you are. But I'll tell you where I was
[1:53:03] in my denomination.
[1:53:05] Amen. I was only 15 years when I had
[1:53:08] mother ego call and I felt that was
[1:53:11] something like I know
[1:53:15] And I came out
[1:53:17] of Anglicanism.
[1:53:19] I can never go back.
[1:53:24] Even you, brother Sadat.
[1:53:27] You may be hearing new things,
[1:53:29] wondering what is this. You may not
[1:53:32] understand a thing.
[1:53:34] But if you're sick, something in your
[1:53:36] heart is telling you, there's something
[1:53:39] about this.
[1:53:41] I want to put my hands on him.
[1:53:44] If you a seed, it doesn't matter where
[1:53:47] you are born. You may be born in a
[1:53:49] Muslim family. You may be born under the
[1:53:52] Buddhist. You may be born under the
[1:53:54] Anglican Catholic, the Roman Catholic
[1:53:56] state, the it doesn't matter. When you
[1:53:59] hear the cry of the mother,
[1:54:03] you'll begin to spread your wings.
[1:54:06] So little Junior began spreading her
[1:54:08] wings.
[1:54:11] Mother Hen couldn't understand.
[1:54:15] I c you
[1:54:22] children. Look at your brother from
[1:54:24] today. I c him. He will die. How can he
[1:54:29] defy my orders?
[1:54:32] Mother Ed couldn't understand.
[1:54:36] And nobody could cast that mother that
[1:54:38] little ego.
[1:54:43] Chicken
[1:54:45] cannot kill an eagle.
[1:54:47] [Applause]
[1:54:49] Hallelujah.
[1:54:51] Yes, sir.
[1:54:53] And and and you know, little junior
[1:54:55] began spreading the wings
[1:54:58] and then felt strength coming.
[1:55:02] Faith is in you.
[1:55:05] Faith is a revelation.
[1:55:08] You may not know how but something in
[1:55:11] you will reveal to you who you are. You
[1:55:15] say you know what you can overcome this
[1:55:17] situation.
[1:55:19] You are a child of God. You are a
[1:55:21] daughter of God. Somebody who may help
[1:55:24] you.
[1:55:26] God can help you. And then you begin to
[1:55:28] feed on that. You begin to hear the word
[1:55:31] and help you. Strength begins to build
[1:55:34] up.
[1:55:37] And mother was saying, "Junior, you can
[1:55:40] do it.
[1:55:41] You can do it. You can do it." And then
[1:55:44] eventually
[1:55:46] Junior never understood what happened.
[1:55:49] But the moment she was airborne,
[1:55:55] she she realized the power that makes
[1:55:57] her rise
[1:56:01] is already in the sky. Hallelujah.
[1:56:06] The power that will make you overcome
[1:56:08] the world
[1:56:11] is in the Pentecostal sky.
[1:56:15] Begin flying.
[1:56:17] Begin flying in revelation.
[1:56:20] Begin flying in the baption of the Holy
[1:56:21] Ghost.
[1:56:23] Begin flying in one go.
[1:56:25] Begin flying in the opening of the
[1:56:27] spirit. Begin fly. Begin flying
[1:56:31] by saying amen to every word.
[1:56:34] When you eat the message, you realize
[1:56:36] you are flying. You're flying. And
[1:56:39] little ego said, "I can never go back."
[1:56:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. This joy
[1:56:49] that I have, the devil never gave it.
[1:56:54] Something happened on the ego. This joy
[1:56:57] that I have,
[1:56:59] the devil never gave it.
[1:57:02] All this joy that I have.
[1:57:05] Meanwhile,
[1:57:12] mother never gave it to me.
[1:57:15] Mother never gave it.
[1:57:24] all over me. He's keeping me alive.
[1:57:28] What is it? It's the Holy Ghost and
[1:57:30] flying. And let me tell you, we are
[1:57:33] flying in revelation
[1:57:36] in our day.
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:39] It's not one man with revelation
[1:57:43] collective body of Christ.
[1:57:47] Amen. Amen. Let me tell you something.
[1:57:50] We have gone beyond one man ministry.
[1:57:55] That is why even when God heals you, a
[1:57:59] miracle is done.
[1:58:01] We don't give testimonies like the
[1:58:03] Pentecost.
[1:58:06] I was dying.
[1:58:08] And then the man of God
[1:58:15] We are beyond that.
[1:58:19] You know who you are. The power that
[1:58:21] makes you know where it comes from. We
[1:58:24] are no longer seeking for anointed ones
[1:58:28] because we we know we ourselves
[1:58:30] are anointed. Hallelujah.
[1:58:35] You get the point. It's no longer one
[1:58:38] man's ministry.
[1:58:40] That's why we rest.
[1:58:43] Stop going from hiking from church to
[1:58:45] church.
[1:58:47] We are looking for anointed ministry.
[1:58:50] In this message, there is no one man
[1:58:53] that is anointed more than others.
[1:58:57] It is an anointed message.
[1:59:02] Hallelujah. Are you following what I'm
[1:59:04] saying?
[1:59:05] So what I'm saying when you receive the
[1:59:08] anointed message,
[1:59:10] you will begin to respect and honor
[1:59:12] every ministry that is preaching the
[1:59:14] revealed word
[1:59:20] and you will be stable
[1:59:22] where God has placed you and you will
[1:59:26] serve God and love you
[1:59:29] and grow in the stage of Christ.
[1:59:33] That's why we are no longer preaching
[1:59:35] ourselves.
[1:59:39] No.
[1:59:42] Whenever you see a minister
[1:59:45] s up on the pulpit and begin to
[1:59:49] everything,
[1:59:50] there's a problem. I tell you, run away.
[1:59:54] The day I become like that, all of you
[1:59:56] run away.
[1:59:59] I'm warning you now. It's not me
[2:00:01] speaking. Is God speaking?
[2:00:05] Run away. It's not about a man.
[2:00:09] It's about the word.
[2:00:11] We're not preaching to you to to to be
[2:00:14] uh to to pay allegiance to a man.
[2:00:18] To hang on to a man.
[2:00:21] Hang on to the word.
[2:00:23] Hang on to Christ. The revealed word of
[2:00:26] the earth.
[2:00:27] His word will take you over into
[2:00:34] Amen. And there was nobody able to open
[2:00:37] the book and to lose the seals there.
[2:00:40] What is this book? It's the book of
[2:00:43] redemption. It's back into the hands of
[2:00:45] the original owner.
[2:00:48] But you know what? He came right down
[2:00:53] to the book and he lose the sins.
[2:00:57] Amen. Hallelujah. And then the Bible
[2:01:00] says, "And they sang a new song."
[2:01:05] Amen. Saying, "Thou art worthy to take
[2:01:07] the book and to open the seals there.
[2:01:10] For thou was slain, and you are redeemed
[2:01:13] us to God
[2:01:15] by thy blood
[2:01:17] out of every kind right now, people and
[2:01:20] nation.
[2:01:21] This seven sealed book
[2:01:25] is not some kind of mysterious thing.
[2:01:30] I was telling the brother the other day
[2:01:33] it is a sevensealed book
[2:01:37] but you see the Bible said
[2:01:41] uh it was written
[2:01:45] don't miss this now and on the back side
[2:01:51] say amen if you
[2:01:54] on the back side what do we see Whenever
[2:01:58] a seal is open,
[2:02:01] we see a symbol. What do we see? First
[2:02:04] horse rider, white horse rider. Then
[2:02:08] after the white horse rider, we see the
[2:02:09] red horse.
[2:02:11] Then we see the black horse rider
[2:02:15] rider,
[2:02:16] you know, sold under the altar. These
[2:02:18] are symbols and all these symbols are on
[2:02:22] the back side of the book.
[2:02:27] There is something else
[2:02:31] within
[2:02:33] the sales.
[2:02:35] And let me say allow me to say this.
[2:02:38] This is the real opening of the seal.
[2:02:43] What is within? Remember this is the
[2:02:46] book of redemption.
[2:02:50] Redemption.
[2:02:52] It is pointing to something.
[2:02:54] Somebody has to be redeemed.
[2:02:57] So what is it about?
[2:02:59] The one on the inside.
[2:03:02] It's about that one.
[2:03:07] I don't know what you understand by
[2:03:08] that.
[2:03:10] But I'll tell you, I am the one on the
[2:03:12] inside.
[2:03:15] This is all about you, the bride,
[2:03:19] and about the lamb taking the book to
[2:03:22] redeem the blood.
[2:03:27] That's why after the opening of the
[2:03:29] script
[2:03:30] there was a new song s
[2:03:34] you are slain
[2:03:36] and you have redeemed us
[2:03:39] to God
[2:03:41] by thy blood
[2:03:44] out of every kindred
[2:03:46] out of every kind out of
[2:03:55] All tribes all over the world.
[2:04:01] It doesn't matter your tribe.
[2:04:04] He has redeemed out of each tree.
[2:04:08] This is not the redemption of Jews.
[2:04:11] The redemption of Gentiles.
[2:04:15] Open your eyes and see.
[2:04:18] This is about you.
[2:04:23] Even the mystery nature which has been
[2:04:26] healed.
[2:04:29] Hallelujah.
[2:04:31] Revelation 10
[2:04:34] as the seventh angel as the as the angel
[2:04:36] as the angel came down with a cloud
[2:04:38] around his head
[2:04:40] with a rainbow around his head.
[2:04:43] Follow me now. I'm going ahead out of my
[2:04:45] my not here but it's all right. A third
[2:04:48] angel came down. Revelation 10:1
[2:04:51] can put it up on the screen. And in his
[2:04:54] hand was a what? A little book open.
[2:05:00] Are you following me?
[2:05:02] Are you enjoying this? A little book
[2:05:05] open.
[2:05:07] In his hand was a little book.
[2:05:12] Connect with me now.
[2:05:15] Amen. As that angel came down, he had in
[2:05:17] his hand a little book open.
[2:05:22] And the Bible says, he set his right
[2:05:25] foot upon the sea.
[2:05:29] And and and his left foot on the earth.
[2:05:34] And all right, continue. And he had in
[2:05:36] his Okay, give me three, brother. And he
[2:05:39] cried with a loud voice
[2:05:42] as when a lion roarth.
[2:05:45] And when he had cried,
[2:05:49] seven what?
[2:05:51] Seven thundersed
[2:05:55] there.
[2:05:58] Okay, remember thunder is a voice of God
[2:06:03] and it is saying something
[2:06:06] four. And when thunder that voices,
[2:06:12] John was about to write
[2:06:15] But I he said I heard a voice from
[2:06:16] heaven saying,
[2:06:24] "These are the seals
[2:06:27] that were within
[2:06:29] not
[2:06:33] which the seven
[2:06:36] and write them not."
[2:06:39] Oh my I wish I'd continue on that but
[2:06:43] for later. But I wanted to say this.
[2:06:46] Brother Bham says you if you you're
[2:06:49] baptized in the Holy Ghost
[2:06:52] born again and changed
[2:06:55] you come to a place
[2:06:58] where you
[2:07:00] you become a thunder
[2:07:04] to the devil
[2:07:06] whereby he doesn't know what to do.
[2:07:10] anymore.
[2:07:12] The thunders
[2:07:14] is not something coming or a revelation.
[2:07:18] I am a thunder to the devil.
[2:07:22] The book of redemption
[2:07:25] is about you
[2:07:27] and Christ.
[2:07:29] You and the lamb.
[2:07:36] And you have redeemed us to God.
[2:07:39] It was about the bleach,
[2:07:41] the bleach of the blood. There was
[2:07:43] nothing could could cleanse us or or
[2:07:45] wash take away our sin.
[2:07:48] We were in sin. We are defeated.
[2:07:59] But he says like a drop of ink
[2:08:03] falls into a bleach. What happened
[2:08:06] immediately? The black stain is gone.
[2:08:10] You couldn't find it again if you had.
[2:08:13] It's gone. You will never see it no
[2:08:15] more. What happened now? You don't see
[2:08:18] some nothing come come from it.
[2:08:22] Why don't you? Because it's broke up.
[2:08:29] And now science says it has turned back
[2:08:31] into its original.
[2:08:37] What did the acids come from? Where come
[2:08:40] from?
[2:08:41] It come from certain things.
[2:08:44] All right. Say for instance like fumes
[2:08:47] made acids
[2:08:51] made acids
[2:08:53] fumes made acids.
[2:08:56] I I will call a science teacher to come
[2:08:58] and interpret this part. Where did fumes
[2:09:01] come from?
[2:09:03] Well, it was we will say fumes was made
[2:09:06] of molecules.
[2:09:12] Where did molecules come from?
[2:09:15] From atoms.
[2:09:18] Where did the atoms come from?
[2:09:21] From electrons.
[2:09:22] [Music]
[2:09:24] This one is a seventh grader speaking
[2:09:26] this thing.
[2:09:29] Where did they come from?
[2:09:32] Cosmic light
[2:09:36] your plan back again past finding
[2:09:41] chemist now. And if it it's a substance
[2:09:44] and a creation, it has to come from a
[2:09:46] creator.
[2:09:51] So you are not sitting here by chance.
[2:09:55] There is reason for you to believe.
[2:09:59] there is some reason for you not to
[2:10:00] believe also
[2:10:03] just like with that ink.
[2:10:06] When a man sinned,
[2:10:09] he separated himself from God
[2:10:13] and crossed the great chasm
[2:10:17] and put himself in death on this side.
[2:10:22] There is no way back.
[2:10:24] There's no way for him to go back.
[2:10:28] But when he did,
[2:10:30] God accepted a substitute
[2:10:38] which was a lamb,
[2:10:42] something for blood,
[2:10:44] which Adam spoke
[2:10:47] or rather spoke on the other side of the
[2:10:50] castle
[2:10:52] on that side on the other side of the
[2:10:54] castle.
[2:10:56] He's a son of God. He's an offspring
[2:10:58] from God. He is an inheritance of the
[2:11:01] earth.
[2:11:03] He can control nature.
[2:11:06] He's not talking about somebody. He's
[2:11:09] talking about you. What you can do.
[2:11:14] You are a son of God, an offspring from
[2:11:16] God. You have the inheritance of the
[2:11:18] earth. You can control nature. He can
[2:11:22] speak into existence.
[2:11:24] Have you not seen people who say that
[2:11:26] they can stop rain
[2:11:30] with witchcraft?
[2:11:32] Have you not seen?
[2:11:37] Answer if you have seen.
[2:11:40] Now that authority
[2:11:42] doesn't belong to them.
[2:11:45] They are impersonators.
[2:11:47] It belongs to a son of God.
[2:11:51] We are the ones with that kind of
[2:11:52] authority.
[2:11:54] Have you not seen people who uh they say
[2:11:56] that they are snake whispers, whisperers
[2:11:58] or something like that?
[2:12:02] Like I mean they calm down them down and
[2:12:04] they talk to them and they
[2:12:08] others they t lions.
[2:12:11] Some of them like here in Africa they
[2:12:13] use witchcraft to do that
[2:12:17] even when they become so big.
[2:12:20] Witchcraft is only a perversion of the
[2:12:22] power of God.
[2:12:25] It only comes to show
[2:12:28] original somewhere.
[2:12:31] So these things are telling us
[2:12:33] if you see fake money,
[2:12:36] it means there is original money.
[2:12:39] Except when I tell you what I'm telling
[2:12:40] you,
[2:12:43] if you are when you become a son of God,
[2:12:46] you have realized who you are, you can
[2:12:48] control nature.
[2:12:51] You can speak into existence.
[2:12:55] You are a creator
[2:12:57] yourself
[2:12:58] an offspring of God.
[2:13:01] Many times we want to say let there be
[2:13:03] this.
[2:13:04] And we want to close our eyes and open.
[2:13:08] But remember God said let there be man
[2:13:11] in my image. It must have t it might
[2:13:13] have taken billions of years.
[2:13:17] We don't know how long it took. It took
[2:13:19] so long.
[2:13:22] But when God speaks a word, it can't
[2:13:25] fall to the ground. It comes back again
[2:13:28] and it will always be fulfilled.
[2:13:32] Whatever he says. It may not happen like
[2:13:36] but it will always happen.
[2:13:41] But when he crossed
[2:13:43] he separated his sunship.
[2:13:48] He's a sinner by nature. He's under the
[2:13:52] hands and dominion of Satan.
[2:13:55] And God took a sacrifice,
[2:13:58] a chemical of the blood.
[2:14:02] But the blood of bulls and God did not
[2:14:04] divorce sin.
[2:14:08] It only covers sin. And I've got a red
[2:14:11] spot on my hand and and cover it with
[2:14:13] white. And red spot is still there. It's
[2:14:15] still there.
[2:14:21] But God sent down from heaven.
[2:14:25] A bleach.
[2:14:28] A bleach.
[2:14:30] Everybody say a bleach.
[2:14:32] For sin.
[2:14:35] It was the blood
[2:14:37] of his own son
[2:14:42] that when our confess sins drops into
[2:14:45] God's bleach,
[2:14:47] [Applause]
[2:14:52] try to find it again.
[2:14:56] The coloring of sin,
[2:14:59] it goes back through the mediators
[2:15:03] down through time
[2:15:06] until it hits the accuser, Satan
[2:15:12] and lays on him till the day of
[2:15:15] judgment.
[2:15:18] What happens to the son?
[2:15:21] He becomes in perfect fellowship with
[2:15:23] the father again.
[2:15:27] standing on the other side of the
[2:15:31] no remembrance of sin against him
[2:15:35] no more. There is no more stain of
[2:15:38] bleach can be seen anywhere.
[2:15:42] He is free.
[2:15:47] That ink can never be ink no more
[2:15:49] because he's broke up and sent back
[2:15:51] again.
[2:15:55] And when confessed sin is confessed and
[2:15:57] being dipped into a man or a woman
[2:16:00] that's been dipped in the blood of Jesus
[2:16:01] Christ, it kills all symptoms.
[2:16:14] never to come in remembrance no more.
[2:16:18] And a man, now stay with me here, and a
[2:16:20] man stands justified
[2:16:24] as a son of God.
[2:16:29] Praise God.
[2:16:31] Praise God.
[2:16:34] Now, I want you to listen to this part.
[2:16:40] The for the fortified title deed, the
[2:16:43] for title deed rather
[2:16:53] is now in the hands of the original
[2:16:54] owner.
[2:16:59] The title deed is to the earth
[2:17:04] and to eternal life. When Adam fulfeated
[2:17:07] it,
[2:17:09] then Satan's hands could not take it.
[2:17:13] He went back to God.
[2:17:16] We are going to find it just in a
[2:17:18] minute. There he sits on the throne
[2:17:22] with it in his hand.
[2:17:25] Oh, that makes me feel religious.
[2:17:33] If they had stolen your title deed,
[2:17:38] found it. Somebody holding it. How do
[2:17:41] you feel?
[2:17:44] You have gotten the title again. People
[2:17:47] killed each other because of landing.
[2:17:51] But for us, we are ready to kill Satan
[2:17:54] and all his demons.
[2:17:58] We must get our hands to this title.
[2:18:03] Hallelujah. Amen. When you get your
[2:18:06] hands to the title,
[2:18:08] you can no longer live the way you've
[2:18:09] been living in it.
[2:18:12] You realize there's a better life.
[2:18:16] That's what this message is all about,
[2:18:17] friends.
[2:18:19] The title D to eternal life.
[2:18:22] And he calls it the abstract title D to
[2:18:24] eternal life.
[2:18:27] When Adam forfeated it for wisdom
[2:18:30] instead of faith, it went back to the
[2:18:34] hands of the owner, the almighty God.
[2:18:38] What is it doing in the hands of God?
[2:18:42] Listen now. I I want to try and climax
[2:18:47] for this service tonight.
[2:18:49] What is it doing in the hands of God?
[2:18:53] Why does God have
[2:18:56] He's waiting for redemption claims.
[2:19:03] He's waiting for someone to claim it.
[2:19:08] Someone who has claimed redemption,
[2:19:15] it has to either be Adam
[2:19:17] or his brother.
[2:19:20] Hallelujah.
[2:19:22] Are you following me? Adam,
[2:19:26] that's the law of Adam.
[2:19:29] But Adam was not worthy.
[2:19:33] None of his natural brothers was worthy.
[2:19:37] So God being God,
[2:19:40] he said, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I will
[2:19:43] become."
[2:19:45] [Music]
[2:19:46] [Applause]
[2:19:48] Hallelujah. And then he came Amen. As a
[2:19:52] lamb. That's why when John turned to
[2:19:54] see,
[2:19:56] he saw a lamb,
[2:19:58] a slain from before the foundation,
[2:20:03] he made a way of redemption.
[2:20:06] He made a way back.
[2:20:09] And someday
[2:20:11] the redeemer is to take it back.
[2:20:15] You see where we are going to get now?
[2:20:18] We will watch this fellow sitting upon
[2:20:19] the throne
[2:20:21] waiting for redemption claims.
[2:20:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the name
[2:20:28] of the Lord.
[2:20:31] I have many things to read for you. But
[2:20:33] let me try to sum up the service.
[2:20:36] He says, "But God is law received a
[2:20:38] substitute.
[2:20:43] What if God had not offered to take a
[2:20:45] substitute?
[2:20:50] What if God had not offered a substance?
[2:20:55] Do you want to see what he says next?
[2:20:59] But love, tell your neighbor, love.
[2:21:04] Love constrained him to do.
[2:21:12] That man was without a way back.
[2:21:16] And there is no way for him to get back.
[2:21:20] He was gone. Yes, he's talking about me.
[2:21:25] But the grace of God
[2:21:28] made this kinsman redeemer
[2:21:33] in the person of Jesus Christ.
[2:21:37] Hallelujah. Lord required death.
[2:21:42] Lord required to claim this book.
[2:21:47] And you cannot claim the book
[2:21:50] without paying the price.
[2:21:52] And the price was dead.
[2:21:56] But God became man.
[2:22:00] Forget about the trinity teaching.
[2:22:03] They teach three gods instead of one.
[2:22:07] We don't believe in no three gods. We
[2:22:09] believe in one god.
[2:22:12] And that god is a spirit.
[2:22:15] But God became man.
[2:22:19] And he came, he became man to do what?
[2:22:23] To pay the price.
[2:22:26] So that he can bring Oh mama, listen to
[2:22:30] me in our church. So that he can bring
[2:22:33] forth the bleach.
[2:22:38] the bleach of the blood
[2:22:41] which will make Adam and his entire race
[2:22:43] free
[2:22:47] which would give Adam and access
[2:22:53] to go back into the holy of holies to go
[2:22:56] back in the garden.
[2:22:58] So now take me into the holy
[2:23:03] take me in by the blood of the
[2:23:08] someone receiving this revelation
[2:23:10] tonight.
[2:23:11] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. I said
[2:23:14] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:23:18] Amen.
[2:23:19] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That man was
[2:23:24] without a way back
[2:23:27] and there's no way for him to get back.
[2:23:29] He was gone. But the grace of God met
[2:23:31] this kinsman redeemer in the person of
[2:23:33] Jesus Christ.
[2:23:36] The law.
[2:23:38] The law required it.
[2:23:41] And grace
[2:23:43] met
[2:23:45] its requirement.
[2:23:50] Hallelujah sons of Yahu.
[2:23:55] Grace met the requirements of the law.
[2:23:59] How amazing grace
[2:24:02] how sweet a sound.
[2:24:04] God's law required an innocent
[2:24:06] substitute.
[2:24:12] And God himself
[2:24:14] said no angel will do it. No man is
[2:24:17] worthy. I am going to do it.
[2:24:20] God himself came down and he died that
[2:24:24] he may make a way for you
[2:24:27] to your true origin.
[2:24:32] Some of you who receive this revelation,
[2:24:35] you will begin to tell the devil.
[2:24:38] Amen. Not here even there. When he
[2:24:41] begins to torment you,
[2:24:43] tell him, "I am not what you think I
[2:24:45] am."
[2:24:48] begin to practice that.
[2:24:51] You are going to see what will happen.
[2:24:54] Amen. If you are poor, begin to say, "I
[2:24:56] am rich."
[2:24:58] If you are bound by sin, you begin to
[2:25:01] say, "I am not a sinner. I am holy. I am
[2:25:04] righteously forgiven.
[2:25:08] I'm redeemed."
[2:25:11] Grace met the Lord's requirement.
[2:25:19] Tell me, what did the thief on the cross
[2:25:22] do?
[2:25:26] Nothing.
[2:25:28] He accepted
[2:25:30] grace.
[2:25:32] For because grace had already met the
[2:25:36] requirements of the Lord.
[2:25:40] How do you receive grace? How do you
[2:25:43] accept it? By accepting the word of your
[2:25:46] day,
[2:25:49] if you walk away from it,
[2:25:52] no more forgiveness,
[2:25:55] no more redemption for you because the
[2:25:57] word is Christ.
[2:26:00] And the word at that moment was right
[2:26:03] there on the cross with them.
[2:26:06] The other one was laughing. He had no
[2:26:08] revelation.
[2:26:10] Save us and yourself. If you are saying
[2:26:13] you are who you say you are,
[2:26:16] look at this fool. No revelation. The
[2:26:20] Bible says a fool has said in his heart
[2:26:23] is not God. And here is a fool who could
[2:26:27] stand before God
[2:26:29] and say if you say you are
[2:26:32] save us and yourself.
[2:26:37] One of man who had revelation
[2:26:40] what you fear God
[2:26:44] who told him this is God
[2:26:47] revelation
[2:26:49] grace opened
[2:26:53] don't you fear God
[2:26:56] and then he turned to Jesus he said
[2:26:58] remember me when you come into
[2:27:03] [Music]
[2:27:04] I am that thief
[2:27:06] I am that dying thief.
[2:27:10] Remember me.
[2:27:14] Bring me to your kingdom.
[2:27:17] Our father who art in heaven.
[2:27:20] Be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
[2:27:24] Thy kingdom come. His kingdom is here
[2:27:28] in the form
[2:27:30] of the word.
[2:27:33] When they reject the word,
[2:27:35] they have rejected the king.
[2:27:38] When you accept the word,
[2:27:41] you have accepted.
[2:27:45] And as I finish, I'm done. Actually,
[2:27:48] stand on your feet.
[2:27:50] That man,
[2:27:52] when he died, he died. All right. Both
[2:27:56] of them died. All right.
[2:27:58] But one of them went into the kingdom.
[2:28:03] There were two places and they were kept
[2:28:05] in.
[2:28:07] The ones who refuse to believe
[2:28:10] were always going in a in in in the in a
[2:28:13] place of of torment
[2:28:16] and the others would go to paradise
[2:28:20] under the blood of bulls and goats.
[2:28:23] But the but the fresh one
[2:28:27] was this thief on the cross.
[2:28:32] When Jesus went into hell
[2:28:35] things I want to tell you he opened the
[2:28:37] other door
[2:28:39] and the others oh save us
[2:28:45] open for us. You open the door. Said,
[2:28:49] "Why didn't you believe
[2:28:54] and he banged the door, walked away?"
[2:28:58] Remember, he had already gone. After
[2:29:02] that, he went right to hell
[2:29:05] and he took the keys from there. That
[2:29:07] that devil,
[2:29:10] Jesus has the keys,
[2:29:13] the authority. He has it all. That's why
[2:29:16] he's our redeemer.
[2:29:18] That's why he he he can speak.
[2:29:22] And when you receive him in your heart,
[2:29:25] you two can now speak.
[2:29:28] As musicians come and at that moment,
[2:29:33] you know, he walked by
[2:29:36] and this is the part I love most.
[2:29:40] He he entered the other place
[2:29:43] and he started.
[2:29:47] He was not dead. He never died.
[2:29:50] He was very busy in hell.
[2:29:54] When he says he preached to the souls in
[2:29:55] prison,
[2:29:58] those are the ones who never believe
[2:30:01] and he did not preach to them to be
[2:30:02] saved.
[2:30:04] He preached to condemn them.
[2:30:08] But he went over to his friends, the
[2:30:11] ones that had believed and Sarah said,
[2:30:14] "Darling,
[2:30:16] darling,
[2:30:20] you know Abraham,
[2:30:23] who is that one knocking?
[2:30:26] Go and check."
[2:30:29] You know, Abraham is the father of the
[2:30:30] faith.
[2:30:32] Must have been the one that kicking the
[2:30:34] door. She went to check and after she
[2:30:37] opened the door,
[2:30:39] she began screaming,
[2:30:43] "Come and see. He's the one finally.
[2:30:49] Are you sure?"
[2:30:52] While he was still shouting,
[2:30:54] Job also said, "Hey,
[2:30:59] I know him. I know him. I experience
[2:31:03] him.
[2:31:04] I know him.
[2:31:06] Everyone,
[2:31:08] my friends, my friends, move away. This
[2:31:12] one is the one.
[2:31:15] Everyone had an experience with him
[2:31:20] over the ages.
[2:31:22] They saw him because grace had made the
[2:31:26] require.
[2:31:29] And finally, this is my favorite part.
[2:31:33] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. That thief
[2:31:35] on the cross, he too was in there
[2:31:40] quiet the whole time.
[2:31:43] But the moment he had them shouting and
[2:31:47] he had them describe him,
[2:31:50] he couldn't help it. He said, "Let me
[2:31:52] see."
[2:31:54] And when he beep,
[2:31:58] hallelujah. Just before Jesus had come
[2:32:01] here,
[2:32:02] this guy had entered this place
[2:32:05] and he was telling them the story
[2:32:08] how he was on the cross-
[2:32:11] with the other two men
[2:32:13] and but one in the middle looked like he
[2:32:17] was God and you know Abraham could
[2:32:19] relate.
[2:32:22] Those of you who know the Bible know
[2:32:24] Abraham could relate.
[2:32:27] Remember the man in the middle
[2:32:30] So now before he could finish the story,
[2:32:33] that's when he was interrupted by these
[2:32:34] things.
[2:32:36] But now
[2:32:38] he saw him and his judge dropped
[2:32:43] says please brethren all of you keep
[2:32:47] quiet
[2:32:49] my testimony is the biggest
[2:32:53] let me tell all of you this is the man
[2:32:56] I've been talking about.
[2:33:01] just a few hours ago.
[2:33:07] He's the one. He's the one. The one
[2:33:12] you have to listen to my testimony.
[2:33:16] Please all of you listen. I saw him
[2:33:19] lasting
[2:33:22] now. Let me tell you brethren, I am that
[2:33:26] thief. I am the bride of the last age.
[2:33:34] I am seeing him last. Hallelujah.
[2:33:40] When we see him, the Bible says in first
[2:33:43] Thessalonians
[2:33:45] 4 that the dead in Christ are right
[2:33:47] first and we live and remain
[2:33:52] and meet him. You know what? When they
[2:33:55] all shouting and rejoicing, when we tell
[2:33:57] them, all of you shout,
[2:34:00] we have a bigger testimony.
[2:34:03] We saw him last
[2:34:05] in our age. We saw him last.
[2:34:09] He's our redeemer.
[2:34:14] Grace made the requirement.
[2:34:17] We have a reason to dance.
[2:34:20] Come on, you can die. Hallelujah. Yes,
[2:34:23] sir.
[2:34:25] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. My my my friend.
[2:34:29] Are you not so happy? Are you not so
[2:34:31] glad
[2:34:33] that we have a kingsman redeemed?
[2:34:39] Grace
[2:34:40] met the requirement
[2:34:46] of the Lord.
[2:34:49] [Music]
[2:34:52] Come on, worship him everybody.
[2:34:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. As the song
