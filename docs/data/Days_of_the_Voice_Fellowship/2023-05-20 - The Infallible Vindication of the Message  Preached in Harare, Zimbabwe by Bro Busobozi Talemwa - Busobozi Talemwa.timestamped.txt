[1:03:51] is whether the message is
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:01] searching for Vindication
[1:04:05] and they're trying to discredit the
[1:04:07] message

[1:15:35] for him to be Vindicated

[1:15:53] he couldn't do it
[1:15:55] without doubting the word himself
[1:16:00] if Jesus did it
[1:16:02] it means he had doubted who he was
[1:16:08] because he had done it
[1:16:16] do you realize
[1:16:17] Jesus was the word himself
[1:17:06] I will not give it to you
