[23:06] of Kumba.
[23:08] Then from the offering bag, we have
[23:10] 4,000
[23:13] from the offering bag here. Then today
[23:16] we have a total of 1 1,577,000.
[23:26] Then overall total 13 million this is
[23:31] for 10 weeks 13,651,700.
[23:40] [Applause]
[23:44] Amen. May God bless you so much. I have
[23:47] some updates here
[23:50] uh that to give you.
[23:52] Uh we paid for our church land the first
[23:56] installment 100 million
[23:58] and we had a balance of
[24:02] uh a balance of 12 million and 500
[24:07] and the agreement was to be paid in one
[24:10] year.
[24:12] So
[24:14] I have here an agreement I want to read
[24:16] for you. I know some of us come late but
[24:20] I believe uh we are going to stream it.
[24:25] I want to read here this portion.
[24:29] I hope all of us understand.
[24:32] This portion says that the purchaser
[24:35] shall pay the vendor
[24:38] uh
[24:40] 120 million and 500 shillings
[24:45] uh being the balance
[24:48] on the purchase on the purchase price of
[24:51] the land described in 12 months
[24:55] in installment of 30 millions shillings
[24:59] every 3 months. So uh from from the date
[25:04] of signing this agreement. So it means
[25:08] that every 3 months we have to pay 30
[25:11] millions.
[25:14] Uh and we have so far
[25:18] moved 10 weeks. We are remaining with
[25:21] two weeks to make 3 months.
[25:24] And in 10 weeks we have contributed
[25:30] 13 millions.
[25:33] It means
[25:35] that uh we are remaining with 2 weeks to
[25:40] contribute to contribute the remaining
[25:42] balance
[25:43] which is about
[25:46] uh which is about 17 million
[25:50] is 16 16 million.4 four.
[25:54] This is according to the agreement.
[25:57] So our target we are we are supposed to
[26:01] contribute
[26:03] uh 30 millions in every 3 months. It
[26:07] means that every month we have to
[26:09] contribute 10 millions.
[26:11] That means we should contribute the
[26:14] average of of 2.5 millions per week.
[26:20] uh that means we are still below our
[26:22] target because according to what we
[26:25] contribute
[26:27] we have now uh 13 million and 600
[26:33] in 10 weeks it means we have the average
[26:35] per week 1.36
[26:38] millions
[26:40] praise the lord so we need to add more
[26:43] efforts
[26:46] uh in our groups we still have people
[26:48] who have never contributed to their
[26:51] commitment.
[26:52] You made a pledge and you made it to
[26:55] God. Uh there are so people think that
[26:59] by contributing you are you want to make
[27:02] us happy or to make the pastor happy.
[27:04] That means you have no revelation of why
[27:06] you are giving and by that you cannot be
[27:09] blessed. Praise God. You are giving to
[27:12] God.
[27:14] And whenever we call you to remind you
[27:16] of your balance,
[27:18] I don't think that we are we the money
[27:21] we we are the one who need it but we are
[27:24] also playing our part
[27:26] to make sure that the money is being
[27:28] banked. So, uh we need to work together
[27:34] and
[27:37] uh
[27:44] I want to comment on on some group like
[27:47] I have this group Cola
[27:49] [Music]
[27:51] it's not Cola is John Weasley.
[27:55] John Weasley
[27:57] is not performing well and I believe we
[28:01] have members there who can do the best.
[28:04] Praise God. This group has not been
[28:07] performing well. I don't know the if the
[28:09] problem is with leadership or if the
[28:12] problem is the people. So if it is
[28:15] leadership
[28:17] we we are going to work on that. We see
[28:19] if there is anyone willing to take
[28:21] leadership. John Wasley
[28:24] please you come to us. Uh we have ever
[28:27] done this. We had a group Martin it was
[28:31] group Martin and it was not performing
[28:34] well. Uh we changed leadership and since
[28:38] then it has been performing well. It is
[28:40] always in a 100 plus. Praise God.
[28:45] Uh so if you're a leader and your group
[28:47] is not performing well, you have to make
[28:50] sure at least you add some members who
[28:54] can push it. Praise God. Uh I want to
[28:59] thank the group Colomba.
[29:02] Let us clap for them once again.
[29:06] My God bless you so much. team leader Es
[29:11] done has done some good work by adding
[29:14] some members who can push it. So I think
[29:19] every team leader should take an example
[29:21] of that group
[29:23] because I see it has been performing
[29:24] well and today is has been the first
[29:27] praise God. If every group can
[29:30] contribute 500
[29:35] if every group can contribute 500. So
[29:39] I think we shall be even above our what
[29:42] our target. Praise God. If every group
[29:45] can be like that group or like Martin
[29:48] Luther,
[29:50] we shall not pull a lot.
[29:53] Praise the Lord.
[29:55] So I believe that you should catch up
[29:57] the vision and you put something.
[30:01] Praise God. I believe every every person
[30:03] can give something. If you can you go
[30:06] home and you eat you eat food from
[30:09] Monday up to Sunday you are eating you
[30:11] have never slept hungry but how you
[30:14] cannot say that you come to the house of
[30:16] god even without supporting your group
[30:19] with 5k it is a shame for 10 weeks you
[30:24] have never contributed anything we have
[30:26] the list of the names I know people who
[30:28] have jobs
[30:30] if you don't have a job we shall
[30:32] understand but if you have a job. It's
[30:35] not right. Praise God.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; You have a job. You put food on the
[30:40] table every day, but you fail to
[30:43] contribute 5K.
[30:46] Praise God. You are taking us behind.
[30:50] That's not right and it's not
[30:52] acceptable. So team leaders
[30:56] uh we please you have to contact your
[31:00] members who are not giving and encourage

[49:51] of the Lord?

[50:05] Let let us welcome this brother.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen
[50:12] from lifeboat
[50:14] lifeboat.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Brother, you have to remind me your
[50:16] name. I'm so sorry. I
[50:19] ah
[50:19] &gt;&gt; brother Francis, God bless you.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; I um the reason why I invited him here
[50:25] because I want you to read this. But
[50:26] also
[50:30] uh you know we met uh recently in Budo
[50:34] last year
[50:36] and he was you know announcing the youth
[50:38] their youth convention today
[50:42] and I've always watched the first time I
[50:45] saw him when we I went to their
[50:47] convention
[50:48] two years ago
[50:50] and I was I was moved.
[50:54] I even heard that u I heard something
[50:56] like someone mentioned they said okay
[50:58] their pastor almost was going to cancel
[51:00] their youth convention
[51:05] but the younger people
[51:07] came together and they said no
[51:11] pastor we shall support you
[51:14] stand behind you and since then they are
[51:16] the ones doing everything
[51:19] and so this brother is on the forefront
[51:21] of it I think he's the youth leader
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] And I thought, brother, you can talk and
[51:28] announce this convention, but also while
[51:30] you're doing it, you'll be challenging
[51:31] our young people here.
[51:36] God bless you, brethren.
[51:39] I thank God for this opportunity.
[51:42] Bless you, pastor.
[51:45] A blessing to us as young people.
[51:49] Uh this morning
[51:51] as he said
[51:53] we met uh in
[51:57] I was supposed to be here last Sunday.
[52:01] The other Sunday I was supposed to be
[52:02] in.
[52:04] [Music]
[52:06] I was supposed to be there but I did
[52:09] everything and I failed.
[52:11] So God made it sure that we meet there
[52:13] with him
[52:18] such that this Sunday again we meet him.
[52:22] So we give God the glory
[52:26] without taking more time.
[52:29] I want to uh bring this to your
[52:31] attention
[52:33] that this year from 29th December
[52:39] to first next year
[52:42] That will be January January.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; By God's grace, we organizing an annual
[52:48] youth convention
[52:52] in our usual place. Gayaza High School
[52:58] and in this meeting
[53:01] you are required first to register
[53:05] and then you make your contribution
[53:10] 100,000
[53:12] shillings.
[53:16] This money purposely cater for your
[53:18] accommodation
[53:21] and meals.
[53:25] for two full days and two half days.
[53:34] I don't know whether those are four days
[53:36] or three days.
[53:39] We have mathematicians here.
[53:43] So does your money goes I mean it
[53:46] supports you in all those all those days
[53:51] &gt;&gt; with good meals with good resting.
[53:55] Uh this program in the morning we always
[53:58] have preaching
[54:02] then afternoon we divide oursel
[54:04] according to the to the age.
[54:08] [Music]
[54:10] We have those married people.
[54:14] We have those unmarried but out of
[54:16] school.
[54:19] And we have those that are still in
[54:21] school
[54:23] and even the younger people, the little
[54:25] children.
[54:27] We assemble in different places
[54:31] and we invite ministers
[54:34] to talk to talk to us about the the life
[54:39] because after receiving the word
[54:42] we have also to look to our physical
[54:44] welfare.
[54:46] How we are going to hand oursel as
[54:48] younger people.
[54:50] Remember we are the next generation.
[54:53] they are handing uh this book the word
[54:56] to us.
[55:00] If they don't prepare us
[55:03] will be a disappointment to them.
[55:06] So that's the purpose why we gather
[55:10] and I believe is the same purpose why he
[55:12] calls the younger people.
[55:16] So I officially invite you
[55:20] the man looked to be much
[55:24] But if you lay down the calculations,
[55:27] you realize that you even paying less.
[55:31] I know he's having that experience.
[55:35] So
[55:37] I encourage the younger people.
[55:40] I always tell people to go back to the
[55:42] first church.
[55:45] But after Pentecost,
[55:47] they assembled themselves
[55:50] and they went back and brought whatever
[55:53] they had
[55:55] to support the gospel.
[55:59] So with the last church,
[56:02] let's copy from the first church.
[56:06] I urge you to stand with the pastor. I
[56:09] know immediately after our convention,
[56:11] you will be the rest.
[56:14] So let's hold our hands together.
[56:17] Let's hold our hands together.
[56:20] We'll see the glory of God.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, pastor, for this opportunity.
[56:25] God bless you, brethren.
[56:27] Amen. Amen.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; So we appreciate you, brother Francis,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and the way you stand with your pastor.
[56:38] Uh I hope that you leave that anointing
[56:41] here.
[56:43] that some young people I know there are
[56:45] some who are already doing it but others
[56:46] will also
[56:48] [Music]
[56:50] amen
[56:52] um you know these youth conventions are
[56:54] always a blessing
[56:57] please
[56:59] don't say it is not our youth convention
[57:04] it is ours
[57:07] as long as they are going to teach the
[57:09] message
[57:11] I know they have prepared ministers
[57:15] and every ministry is different
[57:19] and every ministry is a blessing.
[57:24] So um let's try to make it
[57:28] and um I'm sure it will be a blessing.
[57:32] Um just to emphasize the dates are 29th
[57:35] December
[57:37] December to 1st January.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Now um at this moment
[57:47] we
[57:49] um we have a baby dedication.
[57:57] But before the baby dedication,
[58:01] I'd like to I don't know if this

[1:11:04] [Music]
[1:11:05] Hallelujah.
[1:11:13] When a woman
[1:11:15] humbles the man, it means their heart
[1:11:18] has been overcame.
[1:11:20] Let us pray for them.
[1:11:24] Let each one of us raise our hands and
[1:11:26] we pray for them.
[1:11:28] Look at this. Our heavenly father,
[1:11:32] I have here brother Sad and sister
[1:11:33] Monica
[1:11:36] that have sealed their engagement today.
[1:11:40] Dear Lord, you have done it in your
[1:11:42] presence
[1:11:44] and we know that everything that starts
[1:11:46] with you
[1:11:49] starts with you. And Lord, I know you
[1:11:52] are going to continue watching over them
[1:11:55] with many young people leaving anyhow
[1:11:57] they want to live.
[1:12:00] But Lord, you have your special one
[1:12:04] that will always submit to your
[1:12:06] guidance,
[1:12:08] submit to your leadership, submit to
[1:12:10] your word. And we have some of them here
[1:12:14] before me. Lord, I ask your blessing
[1:12:17] upon them. And Lord, I also pray
[1:12:21] the Lord you will sustain them and
[1:12:23] especially the man as he now will go to
[1:12:25] prepare himself
[1:12:28] so that he will come and and and and and
[1:12:30] collect his bride
[1:12:33] that you will provide for him father.
[1:12:35] May he find favor before you favor
[1:12:38] before men. May you open doors for him
[1:12:41] resources, Lord Jesus. Provide unto him,
[1:12:44] Father. He will have enough to come and
[1:12:47] consumate this marriage.
[1:12:49] Father, I also pray for grace upon
[1:12:52] Monica. Father, that you will give her
[1:12:55] guidance and grace that you protect her
[1:12:57] father as she is waiting patient for her
[1:13:01] brother to come and take over.
[1:13:03] May you protect both of them. Bless both
[1:13:06] of them. And in the name of Jesus, we
[1:13:09] pronounce them again.
[1:13:13] God bless you. God bless you. God bless
[1:13:16] you.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:13:25] Brother Sadat
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; is um uh I first received a call from
[1:13:34] um from him and you know he introduced
[1:13:36] himself to me
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; and um he was still in Dubai at the
[1:13:41] time.
[1:13:44] Um, but I'm not surprised that uh he
[1:13:47] picked a somebody from this church
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:13:54] because he has a a sister here.
[1:13:59] Can you stand up, sister Fibby?
[1:14:02] That's a sister to brother Sab.
[1:14:06] Amen.
[1:14:08] And so I also heard from brother Walter
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; who is the pastor there
[1:14:17] the associate. I think the pastor is
[1:14:18] pastor
[1:14:21] and you also heard from their deacon
[1:14:26] who is actually I think a brother from
[1:14:28] Uganda
[1:14:30] and they told me about him
[1:14:33] and um also learned that he's a sister
[1:14:36] is a brother to sister Phy.
[1:14:41] But still I told him I as much as I've
[1:14:43] got all these recommendations about you
[1:14:45] and everything
[1:14:48] I'm not about to let my daughter go
[1:14:53] or to allow you to really get to know
[1:14:55] her that much
[1:14:59] until I've seen you.
[1:15:02] So, if you can please come.
[1:15:05] He was kind. He told me, "Pastor, I'll
[1:15:06] come."
[1:15:08] and he came and we've had um good time
[1:15:11] with him
[1:15:14] um you know to fellowship with him to
[1:15:16] get to know him
[1:15:19] and I think he's a brother that really
[1:15:21] loves the Lord
[1:15:24] and um so met them on several occasions
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:30] and try and give them counsel
[1:15:34] you know in the marriage of the lamb
[1:15:35] brother Banham says
[1:15:39] A decision has to be made.
[1:15:42] To those of you who have gone through my
[1:15:44] hands when you are getting married, you
[1:15:45] know I emphasize this so much.
[1:15:51] I said after the decision, the decision
[1:15:52] has to be made. That one is a hold
[1:15:54] someone
[1:15:57] when you talk about a decision
[1:15:59] you don't just say I have feelings for
[1:16:01] so and so, so let me marry them.
[1:16:06] Ision a decision is made based on many
[1:16:08] things
[1:16:11] and that's what courtship is about
[1:16:16] you you know you get to know the person
[1:16:17] and the person gets to know you
[1:16:20] and um you know while courting also the
[1:16:22] pastor has to be involved
[1:16:27] and at at some point the parents also
[1:16:29] have to be involved.
[1:16:32] This is all for you to make a decision.
[1:16:37] both the young man to make the decision
[1:16:39] and the young lady to make the decision.
[1:16:42] So this can take for as long as the
[1:16:44] decision is not made,
[1:16:47] as long as you're not sure.
[1:16:51] But once you are sure and you are sure
[1:16:54] she's the one, you are sure he's the
[1:16:56] one.
[1:16:59] I've seen some, you know, having ced for
[1:17:01] a while
[1:17:05] and finally the decision is made and is
[1:17:07] in the negative.
[1:17:12] Sometimes the sister, sometimes the
[1:17:14] brother
[1:17:17] and then you have to continue with
[1:17:18] counseling them
[1:17:20] so that they also qu in a good way, good
[1:17:25] Christian way. They separate peacefully
[1:17:27] in a Christian way. Do you see why the
[1:17:29] pastor is necessary?
[1:17:31] You don't come to me when you are 100%
[1:17:33] sure.
[1:17:37] You come when you think you've seen
[1:17:38] somebody.
[1:17:42] Then now you can begin to get cancelled.
[1:17:46] Some of you want to come when everything
[1:17:48] is finished.
[1:17:53] What we need for us. No, we cannot do
[1:17:56] that because
[1:17:58] Why you want to involve God
[1:18:03] at the end not at the beginning?
[1:18:08] Some of you you start things
[1:18:10] like I had a brother saying that you eat
[1:18:13] your frog after it has choked you then
[1:18:15] you run to the pastor.
[1:18:21] Pastor help me
[1:18:23] things are serious.
[1:18:25] I said but how did you even come
[1:18:28] I think we should start right below
[1:18:32] now is finally made
[1:18:36] having agreed with the parents
[1:18:38] who were actually there yesterday. Is it
[1:18:40] yesterday?
[1:18:42] Where is brother? He hid himself. I
[1:18:46] was yesterday.
[1:18:49] Yes. him and a few others went and
[1:18:52] his father pastor Kadu also was there
[1:18:54] and
[1:18:57] they had agreements
[1:19:00] and I had permission to go ahead
[1:19:04] initially. We used to have the
[1:19:06] engagement before that approval from the
[1:19:08] parents.
[1:19:13] But we had issues with that
[1:19:17] cuz you find that now the younger man
[1:19:18] you you say okay we do the engagement
[1:19:20] now you go to the parents
[1:19:26] and then you go to the parents they tell
[1:19:27] you we want 20 cows
[1:19:30] and then you you come and tell us pastor
[1:19:32] I've changed my mind.
[1:19:36] So
[1:19:38] yeah that's the truth. So we thought no
[1:19:41] we have to change it.
[1:19:43] And it must be parents first
[1:19:46] you get approval then now engagement.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And um then then brother Bham says then
[1:19:54] comes the engagement
[1:19:57] and that you find at the altar.
[1:20:01] You've got to make an engagement before
[1:20:02] this union can be.
[1:20:05] [Music]
[1:20:06] And that's the way it is with the church
[1:20:08] of Christ.
[1:20:10] It has to be an engagement with Christ,
[1:20:14] a pledge, an engagement, a love affair.
[1:20:19] That's why you heard him speak all those
[1:20:21] flashy words of love.
[1:20:25] I believe they're coming from the heart
[1:20:28] and then after that
[1:20:30] promises and then the wedding.
[1:20:35] Uh, brother, do you have, brother, do
[1:20:37] you have announcements for the dates of
[1:20:39] the wedding?
[1:20:46] Not yet.
[1:20:49] Okay. They'll let us know
[1:20:51] the announcements for their wedding.
[1:20:55] But what I know is brother that will be
[1:20:57] traveling back to uh Dubai
[1:21:01] and uh then afterwards he will come back
[1:21:04] and and take his bride.
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:08] But I say those of you young men in DVF
[1:21:12] if you sleep too much you can see what
[1:21:13] will happen.
[1:21:18] They will come from Dubai. They will
[1:21:19] come from America. They will come from
[1:21:21] everywhere and they will take them.
[1:21:24] Praise God.
[1:21:25] We still have them here.
[1:21:28] Many of them unless if you want me to
[1:21:30] mention names.
[1:21:33] But I say what what the Lord has done
[1:21:35] for Monica, he will do for every one of
[1:21:38] you sisters.
[1:21:41] Praise God. Let us have a baby
[1:21:43] dedication.
[1:21:46] Um, bring them in.
[1:21:51] Bring them in.
[1:21:55] Bring them in from the fear of sin. Oh,
[1:22:02] bring them in. Amen. Bring them in.
[1:22:09] Amen. and bring the little ones to
[1:22:14] Jesus.
[1:22:19] So this is from brother
[1:22:23] for our son as we prepare for his
[1:22:24] dedication.
[1:22:27] His name is Nariahel.
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:22:33] Nariah means the Lord is my light.
[1:22:39] Light
[1:22:42] In scripture,
[1:22:44] Niah was the father of Baruchia,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah's best friend and scribe,
[1:22:54] which we believe that his path will be
[1:22:56] guided by wisdom and truth.
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:02] Means belonging to God.
[1:23:06] Numbers 3:24
[1:23:08] which we believe that his life and
[1:23:10] purpose are God's gift and calling
[1:23:16] together
[1:23:18] means the Lord is my light
[1:23:23] and I belong to you.
[1:23:26] Amen.
[1:23:28] We pray that he grows up with wisdom,
[1:23:32] walking in that light
[1:23:35] and fulfilling God's plan.
[1:23:39] Amen.
[1:23:41] Congratulations.
[1:23:45] Let us congratulate them.
[1:23:48] Let us pray.
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I will not drop you.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Our heavenly father
[1:24:00] in my hands I have a little bund of joy
[1:24:07] brother Nariah.
[1:24:12] Lord, I remember
[1:24:14] when the mother sister
[1:24:18] was at that moment
[1:24:23] and of desperation
[1:24:26] and I didn't even know the sex of the
[1:24:28] child
[1:24:30] and by inspiration I wrote to brother
[1:24:33] and I told him,
[1:24:37] "Your son and your wife shall be with
[1:24:42] Lord. You knew this boy
[1:24:44] before he was even born.
[1:24:47] And Lord, I pray your blessing upon him.
[1:24:51] The Lord, you will be the light in him
[1:24:55] that you will give him so much wisdom
[1:24:58] and also you will give him so much
[1:24:59] protection.
[1:25:01] Lord, you will be upon him a banner
[1:25:06] that the enemy will not be able to reach
[1:25:08] him. I commit him into your hands, Lord.
[1:25:12] for protection.
[1:25:14] Lord, even as he grows,
[1:25:16] Lord, may you give wisdom also to the
[1:25:18] parents.
[1:25:19] They will they will raise him in the
[1:25:21] fear of the Lord and that they will know
[1:25:23] that this is a duty given to them by
[1:25:25] God.
[1:25:28] Lord Jesus, all life comes from you
[1:25:32] and Lord unto you, we give this life
[1:25:36] to dedicate it before you because it
[1:25:39] came from you. And we ask that your
[1:25:42] angels will be always around about him
[1:25:45] to protect him and watch him, provide
[1:25:48] for the parents always
[1:25:50] spiritual and physical resources
[1:25:54] that they will be able to raise him in
[1:25:55] the fear of God. We dedicate
[1:26:01] into your heart
[1:26:03] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:26:06] Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:09] It's very comfortable in my house.
[1:26:16] Congratulations.
[1:26:21] Believers dedicate children.
[1:26:25] [Music]
[1:26:26] We do not baptize them.
[1:26:29] Praise God.
[1:26:35] Amen.
[1:26:40] We were supposed to have a second
[1:26:42] engagement today,
[1:26:48] but I think we'll push it to next Sunday
[1:26:50] or whichever
[1:26:54] whenever they are ready.

[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I'd like us to sing, my redeemer is your
[1:30:21] faithful and true.
[1:30:23] [Music]
[1:30:27] You know at such a moment you know
[1:30:28] whenever before we go to the word
[1:30:32] it's always important to connect with
[1:30:33] the spirit
[1:30:36] to get out of the flesh enter the spirit
[1:30:40] and then we are bound to hear from him
[1:30:44] as long as the spirit is down in our
[1:30:46] hearts and in his presence. So my desire
[1:30:50] this morning
[1:30:52] because I have a burden to share
[1:30:54] something that is very important
[1:30:57] I'm praying that we will open our hearts
[1:31:00] and be focused.
[1:31:02] He will come and minister to us.
[1:31:06] My redeemer,
[1:31:11] you are faithful and true.
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:17] Everything
[1:31:19] that you have said
[1:31:22] you will do.
[1:31:27] Every morning
[1:31:30] your mercies are new.
[1:31:36] My redeemer,

[1:33:00] [Applause]
[1:33:03] Lord Jesus,
[1:33:06] we sing that because we believe it.
[1:33:10] Now we ask that you will come and
[1:33:11] minister to us.
[1:33:13] Open our hearts, Lord Jesus.
[1:33:16] Father, if there is somebody here that
[1:33:19] is needed spiritually,
[1:33:22] Lord, may you come and minister to them.
[1:33:24] Provide
[1:33:26] spiritual food in your season. Anoint
[1:33:28] me, Lord. Give me strength, Father, to
[1:33:32] speak your word with boldness and give
[1:33:36] them grace to receive it also. And
[1:33:39] Father, Lord, at the end of this
[1:33:41] service, may we all say our hearts burn
[1:33:45] within us as he minister to us. We give
[1:33:48] you the glory in Jesus mighty name.
[1:33:52] Amen. Amen. Please turn to your Bibles
[1:33:55] now
[1:33:57] in the book of Luke chapter 16.
[1:34:01] I see people who are way way behind. I
[1:34:03] can't even see some of them. We have
[1:34:04] some seats.
[1:34:05] [Music]
[1:34:09] If brother Martin can bring some people
[1:34:11] right over here
[1:34:14] if you want to come and sit in front.
[1:34:18] I don't know about we're going to Luke
[1:34:20] 16.
[1:34:24] Every time I used to be in church
[1:34:27] when I was a young man,
[1:34:30] I always desired to be in front
[1:34:34] so that I hear better
[1:34:36] and even I receive better from the Lord.
[1:34:42] If you're not a parent
[1:34:44] and you don't have a child, you may come
[1:34:47] in frontier.
[1:34:50] We are reading from Luke chapter 16.
[1:34:57] Chapter 16:es 1-9.
[1:35:02] This is an interesting story.
[1:35:06] Quite interesting.
[1:35:07] And I just want you to listen to it as I
[1:35:10] read it.
[1:35:16] Amen. If you're reading a Uganda Bible,
[1:35:18] follow as we read. And he said, he said
[1:35:21] also unto his disciples, there was a
[1:35:24] certain rich man, now this is Jesus
[1:35:26] taking care of the disciples,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; which had a steward, and the same was
[1:35:31] accused unto him that he that he had
[1:35:34] wasted his goods. And he called him and
[1:35:37] said unto him, How is it that I hear
[1:35:40] this of thee? Give an account of thy
[1:35:43] stewardship, for thou mayest be no
[1:35:45] longer a steward. Then the steward said
[1:35:48] within himself, "What shall I do? For my
[1:35:50] lord taketh away from me the
[1:35:53] stewardship. I cannot dig to beg. I am
[1:35:56] ashamed.
[1:36:07] when I am put out of the stewardship,
[1:36:11] then may they may receive me into their
[1:36:14] houses.
[1:36:16] So he called every one of his lord's
[1:36:18] dattors unto him, and said unto the
[1:36:21] first, "How much owest thou unto my
[1:36:23] lord?" And he said, "And 100 measures of
[1:36:26] oil." And he said unto him, "Take thy
[1:36:29] bill, and sit down quickly, and write
[1:36:31] 50."
[1:36:33] Then said he to another, "And and uh how
[1:36:37] much ost thou?" And he said, "An 100
[1:36:39] measures of wheat." And he said unto
[1:36:41] him, "Take thy bill and write for for
[1:36:44] score." And the Lord commanded the
[1:36:47] unjust steward because he had done
[1:36:51] wisely. For the children of this world
[1:36:54] are in their generation wiser than the
[1:36:56] children of light.
[1:36:58] And I say unto you, make to yourselves
[1:37:01] friends of the mmon of unrighteousness.
[1:37:05] Can can you imagine what he said there?
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; And I say unto you, make yourselves
[1:37:11] friends of the mmon of unrighteousness
[1:37:15] that when ye fail, they may receive you
[1:37:19] into everlasting habitations.
[1:37:23] Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:37:33] I heard a brother giving a testimony
[1:37:39] um that I think sister Gloria I don't
[1:37:41] know whether she's here
[1:37:44] God bless you sister Gloria Gloria I
[1:37:47] heard that she's she was giving a
[1:37:48] testimony of a new job
[1:37:52] also there's a few others who have been
[1:37:53] testifying
[1:37:56] of new jobs.
[1:37:58] Uh,
[1:38:00] did you testify?
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; So, you also got a new job.
[1:38:10] Um, and you know, a few others
[1:38:13] and also there are a few others who have
[1:38:14] got new jobs, but you don't know yet,
[1:38:16] but they're coming.
[1:38:20] And I'm not speaking presumptuously. I
[1:38:22] know.
[1:38:24] I know. I know what I'm talking about.
[1:38:26] Um and so I thought that this is the
[1:38:31] right time to talk on this subject
[1:38:35] being that there are many who are
[1:38:37] getting new jobs
[1:38:40] because I warned you I told you that if
[1:38:42] you give faithfully
[1:38:46] the Lord is going to bless you.
[1:38:49] But you see not all of us know how to
[1:38:51] handle the blessing.
[1:38:54] Some of you God has blessed you with
[1:38:55] jobs.
[1:38:57] Others God has blessed you with wives,
[1:39:01] others with husbands,
[1:39:04] others God has blessed you with
[1:39:06] children,
[1:39:08] with families. But you see with all
[1:39:11] these blessings
[1:39:13] comes responsibility.
[1:39:16] And there are many people when they get
[1:39:18] they begin to see and even that's why
[1:39:21] the others who are not around today
[1:39:24] you will find they are not around in
[1:39:25] church because of the blessings.
[1:39:29] I said pastor there's the one who told
[1:39:30] me pastor I'm sorry I'm no longer able
[1:39:32] to come because I'm so so busy but I
[1:39:34] stream you know I have this job you know
[1:39:40] and and another one will you know be now
[1:39:42] of course we have mobile money
[1:39:45] so people would send their tithe
[1:39:48] and they feel as long as I'm sending my
[1:39:50] t
[1:39:52] they know I'm around but you see God is
[1:39:54] not interested in your type
[1:39:57] God is interested in your soul
[1:40:00] So whether you are supporting the work
[1:40:02] of God with money,
[1:40:04] that's not the thing. The thing is you
[1:40:07] you as a person,
[1:40:09] God is interested in you.
[1:40:12] And so I felt that we needed to address
[1:40:16] this uh these things.
[1:40:19] And this sermon is not um well, it's
[1:40:22] meant to help you to know how to manage
[1:40:24] the blessing.
[1:40:30] And I'm going to speak to you on a
[1:40:32] sacred trust.
[1:40:35] And when we talk about the blessing,
[1:40:37] people always think about money.
[1:40:41] But it's not only that,
[1:40:44] as we shall see as we go on.
[1:40:48] So would you pray for me?
[1:40:50] I mean it. pray for me in your heart
[1:40:54] that God will help us uh to bring these
[1:40:57] things to you.
[1:40:59] And um you know, being a Sunday and we
[1:41:01] only have one service,
[1:41:04] please let me not rush through.
[1:41:07] You know, you can help the preacher
[1:41:09] preach
[1:41:12] comfortably
[1:41:13] and quickly if you give undivided
[1:41:16] attention.
[1:41:19] But if you come in, go out, come in, go
[1:41:21] out,
[1:41:23] yawn, sleep,
[1:41:26] the preacher will be obstructed
[1:41:30] and it will drain the spirit of God.
[1:41:35] But I want those who will preach with me
[1:41:36] this morning.
[1:41:39] Amen. Stay alert. Sit on the edge of
[1:41:41] your seat
[1:41:44] and be ready to to grab whatever is
[1:41:46] yours.
[1:41:49] Amen.
[1:41:50] I I the first time I read this scripture
[1:41:53] many years ago,
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:57] I really never understood it.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; But I realized people like I think John
[1:42:00] Weasley preached on it.
[1:42:04] Um I think it was John Weasley when he
[1:42:06] was uh uh preaching on the use of money.
[1:42:12] That's a wonderful sermon. You need to
[1:42:13] go and listen to it or rather read it.
[1:42:16] And he preached on on on he gave three
[1:42:19] principles
[1:42:20] said you know make all you can
[1:42:25] save all you can
[1:42:28] give all you can
[1:42:31] there's a very good principles there but
[1:42:34] I'm not going to go that direction
[1:42:36] and um this scripture here
[1:42:39] Jesus was speaking about this unjust
[1:42:42] steward
[1:42:45] And you know this man, you know, he was
[1:42:48] not dealing well with the goods of his
[1:42:50] master,
[1:42:55] he was wasting his goods.
[1:42:59] And so when he was reported to his
[1:43:02] master
[1:43:04] and he learned about it, he did not wait
[1:43:08] for him to be fired so that he can go
[1:43:10] and dig, so he can go and be ashamed.
[1:43:15] [Music]
[1:43:17] Because now he thought to himself,
[1:43:20] I am not I don't have the ability to
[1:43:22] dig.
[1:43:24] I have worked in this office for all
[1:43:26] these years.
[1:43:29] I also don't know how to beg. I don't
[1:43:32] want to bake.
[1:43:35] You know, there are some people who have
[1:43:36] no problems with baking.
[1:43:40] They love baking.
[1:43:43] They are so lazy. They don't want to
[1:43:45] work.
[1:43:48] And so they just always devote
[1:43:51] themselves to asking for help.
[1:43:56] Don't misunderstand him. It is okay to
[1:43:58] get help or to ask for help
[1:44:02] in certain circumstances.
[1:44:05] But I'm talking about people who do not
[1:44:07] want to work
[1:44:09] or find work, but they are always quick
[1:44:13] to asking for help.
[1:44:16] And so this man said, "I cannot beg.
[1:44:19] I'm ashamed to beg,
[1:44:22] brother. I have a lot of stereo." And so
[1:44:25] he says, "I'm ashamed to beg. And also,
[1:44:28] I cannot dig.
[1:44:30] So what am I going to do?"
[1:44:32] So he said I am resolved on what I'm
[1:44:35] going to do
[1:44:37] I when I'm put out of the stewardship
[1:44:43] then I will these people I want them to
[1:44:46] receive me in their houses
[1:44:51] the people I have been serving
[1:44:54] even if I'm no longer the boss
[1:44:57] I want them to still have relations with
[1:44:59] me
[1:45:02] So what did he do? He started on a plan.
[1:45:08] He called one of the servants,
[1:45:12] one of the Lord is debtors
[1:45:16] and he said unto him, "How much do you
[1:45:19] owe unto my Lord?"
[1:45:22] Are you hearing me, church? How much do
[1:45:24] you owe?
[1:45:26] He said, "1 measures of oil.
[1:45:34] Yeah. And and so he said, "Okay, it's
[1:45:37] all right. Come quickly, quickly,
[1:45:39] quickly.
[1:45:40] Now you write down. It's no longer 100.
[1:45:44] It is 50. The 50 I've forgiven you."
[1:45:48] He went, he brought another one. He
[1:45:50] said, "How much do you owe?" He said,
[1:45:53] "100 measures of wheat."
[1:45:57] He says, "Okay, quickly quickly now
[1:45:59] write down 80 quickly." Why? Because he
[1:46:03] was about to be h just away from his
[1:46:06] work or fired.
[1:46:09] So he wanted this deal to be done
[1:46:11] quickly.
[1:46:13] He said, "Right."
[1:46:15] And he got another one. Now Jesus
[1:46:19] commanded this unjust steward.
[1:46:25] You know, usually when I have brothers,
[1:46:27] please help me on my voice. Uh, and now
[1:46:29] it is really looks like I'm it's not
[1:46:32] really good. If someone can help the
[1:46:34] brothers, you you know, now look. And
[1:46:36] the Lord commanded the unjust steward
[1:46:42] because he had done wisely.
[1:46:46] And then he said this word
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; for the children of this world.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus is not saying he had done wisely.
[1:46:56] So you also go and do like that.
[1:47:02] But he's saying he had done wisely
[1:47:07] because he was preparing for the future.
[1:47:14] He was preparing himself
[1:47:17] for the future.
[1:47:20] When I am no longer in this
[1:47:21] responsibility,
[1:47:24] I want to make sure my future is bright.
[1:47:29] So he decided to do like how he did.
[1:47:34] Jesus said wisely
[1:47:39] or I could even say cunning
[1:47:42] for and then he says for the children of
[1:47:43] this world
[1:47:45] are in their generation
[1:47:49] wiser than the children of light.
[1:47:55] Now he's not saying because for them
[1:47:57] they fake things and they they they
[1:47:59] cheat and they do that. So for us we are
[1:48:01] foolish because we don't do it.
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:08] He is saying that the children of this
[1:48:11] world because for them they are children
[1:48:14] of this world
[1:48:17] but we are not children of this world.
[1:48:21] How many are understanding? For us we
[1:48:23] came from God we go back to God.
[1:48:26] That is our true origin.
[1:48:30] Amen. So our future is not here. Our
[1:48:34] future is over there.
[1:48:38] And now Jesus said, "For the children of
[1:48:41] this world are wiser than the children
[1:48:44] of light.
[1:48:49] Think about it. Why? Because they can
[1:48:52] prepare for their future."
[1:48:56] Hallelujah.
[1:48:57] But the children of life, we don't know
[1:49:00] how to prepare for our future.
[1:49:04] We don't know how to use stewardship
[1:49:06] well.
[1:49:09] And then he gave us
[1:49:12] Oh, praise God. I'm telling you, you're
[1:49:15] going to love this because I loved it as
[1:49:17] I was studying.
[1:49:19] Amen. Vers. And then he said, I say unto
[1:49:23] you, make to yourselves
[1:49:27] Friends of the M of unrighteousness.
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:36] Praise God.
[1:49:38] This is what this man did.
[1:49:42] He made himself
[1:49:44] a future
[1:49:47] using money.
[1:49:50] He reduced the debt of the debtors
[1:49:54] and that way he made his future bright.
[1:50:00] Now the Bible is saying we as children
[1:50:03] of life.
[1:50:05] You know we also have a future. So we
[1:50:07] should make ourselves friends
[1:50:11] of the m of unrighteous.
[1:50:14] Well of course the bible says we cannot
[1:50:15] serve two masters.
[1:50:18] We cannot serve God and Mmon,
[1:50:21] but we should make ourselves friends
[1:50:24] with the M of unrighteousness.
[1:50:32] Praise God. After you have made all you
[1:50:35] can,
[1:50:37] how are you using it?
[1:50:40] Use it for your future.
[1:50:44] Whatever substance you have in your
[1:50:46] hand,
[1:50:47] Use it for the kingdom.
[1:50:50] Use it for your future life.
[1:50:53] Because when this life is over,
[1:50:57] what will you be remembered for?
[1:51:01] Hallelujah. What did you do for the
[1:51:03] Lord?
[1:51:05] What did how much investment did you
[1:51:07] make?
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:51:13] So that when you fail,
[1:51:17] This is your future.
[1:51:20] They will receive you into everlasting
[1:51:23] habitation.
[1:51:30] No, no, no, no. Well, you've used your
[1:51:33] resources, right?
[1:51:38] After life fails, after you die, after
[1:51:41] you leave this earth,
[1:51:46] Then you will be received
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; into everlasting habitations
[1:51:55] into eternal life.
[1:51:57] Then you'll receive eternal life.
[1:52:02] Now what is a sacred trust?
[1:52:07] uh the meaning of this word
[1:52:11] you know by dictionary it means I'll
[1:52:12] just read for you the meaning a trust is
[1:52:14] a legal arrangement
[1:52:21] where a person or entity
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:27] which you can call now the trustee
[1:52:32] holds assets for the benefit of another
[1:52:35] person
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:39] or a group or which is now what what we
[1:52:41] can call the beneficiary.
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:47] The the beneficiary
[1:52:49] according to the instructions of the
[1:52:51] person who established the trust.
[1:52:56] Now trusts are used for various purposes
[1:53:01] including asset protection,
[1:53:07] estate planning,
[1:53:11] providing for dependence
[1:53:14] and managing wealth for future
[1:53:17] generations.
[1:53:22] Praise God.
[1:53:24] So what we call a trust,
[1:53:28] if you are a trustee,
[1:53:31] you have been given a a trust,
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; you've been given assets or you've been
[1:53:37] given resources.
[1:53:42] These are not yours.
[1:53:46] They for somebody else,
[1:53:49] but you've been entrusted
[1:53:53] to use them
[1:53:55] for the bene for the benefit of the
[1:53:57] owner.
[1:54:01] Now a sac trust is not something given
[1:54:05] something given.
[1:54:07] It is something entrusted for divine
[1:54:11] purpose.
[1:54:18] everything God places in your hand.
[1:54:21] But you may say, "What is a secret
[1:54:23] trust?"
[1:54:25] So what is it that we have as a trust?
[1:54:30] Me, I'm not even rich. I'm not even uh
[1:54:32] so I don't have I'm not a trustee.
[1:54:36] You know, in the church, we have
[1:54:38] trustees.
[1:54:41] A trustee when they keeping church
[1:54:43] money, it is not theirs to spend,
[1:54:50] but they are entrusted
[1:54:56] to you to to um to use it according to
[1:55:00] the owner.
[1:55:04] Are you following me so far?
[1:55:08] Now, but what is what is the trust that
[1:55:12] you have?
[1:55:16] Ask your neighbor, what is the trust
[1:55:17] that you have?
[1:55:22] Praise God. Each of us here,
[1:55:25] I'm not preaching a sermon from the
[1:55:27] moon.
[1:55:29] I'm talking about things that we are
[1:55:32] already experiencing.
[1:55:36] Each of us here is a trustee.
[1:55:40] You you are a trustee
[1:55:42] in your different capacity.
[1:55:46] You are a trustee. Okay? Are you
[1:55:49] following me? So now everything that God
[1:55:52] places in your hands,
[1:55:56] you have it in your hands. So what do
[1:55:59] you have? Regardless of your age,
[1:56:02] regardless of your responsibility,
[1:56:05] To some of you, maybe you are entrusted
[1:56:08] with a spouse,
[1:56:14] you know, like a wife or a husband.
[1:56:18] You know, to some of you, you are
[1:56:20] entrusted with a child,
[1:56:24] a job. Okay, we have had many others
[1:56:27] getting jobs, jobs, a talent.
[1:56:32] You know, you cannot make someone a
[1:56:34] trustee unless you trust them.
[1:56:38] Praise God. He that is faithful in
[1:56:41] little is also faithful in much.
[1:56:45] Some of you, you know, I was telling a
[1:56:47] brother
[1:56:49] that, you know, we should always have a
[1:56:51] heart
[1:56:53] that is void of competition.
[1:56:57] You don't need to compete with anyone.
[1:57:01] Whatever is yours is yours.
[1:57:05] Are you following me? No one can take
[1:57:07] your place.
[1:57:09] No one can ever take your place in the
[1:57:12] church family, in the home family,
[1:57:14] whatever, at workplace, in the society.
[1:57:18] Some people say, "Oh, they bewitched me
[1:57:20] and I lost my job."
[1:57:22] I do not believe in that.
[1:57:25] If you are a child of God, whatever you
[1:57:28] have has been given to you by God and no
[1:57:32] man can take it out. The Bible says he
[1:57:35] opens the door and no man can shut.
[1:57:39] He shuts and no man can open.
[1:57:42] Regardless of how many connections you
[1:57:44] have,
[1:57:46] you can't get that job unless God has
[1:57:49] opened it.
[1:57:52] But why is it not opening door for some
[1:57:55] of you?
[1:57:57] Because you are not trust worthy
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:03] yet. And God is waiting on you. He's
[1:58:07] watching you. He's watching your life.
[1:58:11] How is he watching you with that trust
[1:58:14] which has been given to you?
[1:58:18] Because he the principle is
[1:58:21] He that is faithful in little
[1:58:24] is also faithful in much.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a testimony
[1:58:33] and I'm so sorry brother and and your
[1:58:35] wife. I'm so sorry. I'm have to say
[1:58:36] this.
[1:58:40] You know this brother and his wife are
[1:58:44] teachers, professional teachers.
[1:58:47] It's been very difficult
[1:58:49] with get them getting jobs
[1:58:52] you know because of ABCD
[1:58:55] but here I told them as a revelation
[1:58:58] brother came here we prayed with them
[1:59:01] and um and I told him brother you see
[1:59:04] because I noticed talked to his team
[1:59:06] leader
[1:59:09] because there were no good job
[1:59:11] therefore there was no good inflow
[1:59:13] within their land fund
[1:59:17] All right. I think it was the sister.
[1:59:19] Where is the sister?
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. She was putting in something.
[1:59:24] She was more faithful than him.
[1:59:27] And so because he did not have what to
[1:59:30] put.
[1:59:33] And so I told him, see, you have to
[1:59:36] excuse me. I'm giving this for your
[1:59:37] benefit.
[1:59:41] miners will not be bigarted. And so I
[1:59:43] told him, brother, look what you have to
[1:59:46] do. I don't know what I had preached
[1:59:48] that day and they were inspired about
[1:59:51] it. And he told me, you know, we have
[1:59:52] made a commitment.
[1:59:54] We are going to begin faithfully giving
[1:59:56] to landfarm.
[2:00:00] Whether we have or we don't have, who is
[2:00:02] the team leader?
[2:00:04] Okay. How many weeks ago is that?
[2:00:11] Sorry,
[2:00:13] seven seven weeks only.
[2:00:16] I was shocked when brother Martin the
[2:00:19] team lead of their group
[2:00:22] where the brother is he told me he's now
[2:00:25] beginning to put seriously
[2:00:28] he's not missing any week. I said all
[2:00:31] right let him now wait and see what will
[2:00:33] happen.
[2:00:35] Shortly after that, his wife got a job.
[2:00:39] [Music]
[2:00:40] Not a small one, a good one.
[2:00:43] Shortly after that,
[2:00:45] he also got a got a job.
[2:00:48] Now, friends, you might you might think,
[2:00:50] well, I don't know how long they stay
[2:00:52] without a job.
[2:00:55] But I can tell you this is not an act of
[2:00:56] man.
[2:00:59] These are principles of the word.
[2:01:02] If you are faithful in little,
[2:01:05] you. God will give you the big because
[2:01:08] he has already seen your faithfulness to
[2:01:10] be a trustee.
[2:01:14] [Music]
[2:01:16] He tests you in the small.
[2:01:19] I've had many people who say, "Oh, when
[2:01:22] I become rich,
[2:01:24] we do things of collecting collecting.
[2:01:27] I'll just buy the church now. I'll just
[2:01:29] build for them." But when you find out
[2:01:32] how much are you giving now,
[2:01:34] nothing.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Forget it.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Even when you get the big money you are
[2:01:38] dreaming about,
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; you cannot you will use it for what
[2:01:42] you're using it for now.
[2:01:46] However, you are spending your little
[2:01:48] resources now
[2:01:51] is how you will spend the big resources
[2:01:53] when they come.
[2:01:56] And God looks at you and he tests you
[2:02:00] with the little things he gives you.
[2:02:04] and he watches how you will behave with
[2:02:07] him.
[2:02:09] What's your priority?
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; What are you looking at? Praise God. Oh,
[2:02:16] I can't go to church because I have no
[2:02:18] transport.
[2:02:20] Oh, okay. You need transport. Oh, if God
[2:02:23] gives me a car, I need a car. I will be
[2:02:26] the first every service. No, God knows
[2:02:30] you will not even be there.
[2:02:32] Because now that you have a car
[2:02:35] and you had many things making you busy,
[2:02:38] you will now become more busier.
[2:02:41] That's when your uncle, your brother,
[2:02:43] your friend, your whatever
[2:02:47] is come and we go together for
[2:02:54] whatever you will go. You will just be
[2:02:56] going.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you have a car because in
[2:03:00] your heart Your priority is not serving
[2:03:02] God.
[2:03:05] The Bible says God is not mocked.
[2:03:10] Whatsoever a man saw it that shall you
[2:03:13] also reap.
[2:03:15] Amen. Praise God.
[2:03:19] So friends, I want us to understand
[2:03:22] there is something about stewardship.
[2:03:27] When God gives you a trust,
[2:03:30] and each of us has a trust, however
[2:03:33] little it might be, but you see, he's
[2:03:36] expecting that it will be multiplied.
[2:03:43] He's expecting you will use it well.
[2:03:47] No man has ever spent time with God and
[2:03:50] got nothing out of it.
[2:03:55] No man has ever invested in the work of
[2:03:58] God and became a failure.
[2:04:02] If you're looking for areas to invest
[2:04:05] in,
[2:04:07] well, I can tell you can invest in many
[2:04:09] projects
[2:04:11] and they will always fail without God.
[2:04:15] But if you invest in the work of God, in
[2:04:20] the things of God, in the children of
[2:04:22] God, in the gospel, in the message, let
[2:04:25] me tell you, you can never be a failure.
[2:04:29] Because for you to become a failure, it
[2:04:32] means God has failed you.
[2:04:35] And God has never failed and will never
[2:04:37] fail anyone.
[2:04:40] Amen. So now a sacras can be anything.
[2:04:46] It can be a wife God has given you.
[2:04:49] It can be a a husband God has given you.
[2:04:53] You know, it can be a child
[2:04:56] God has given to you. It's a sacred
[2:04:58] trust. You know, a job God has given to
[2:05:01] you. You know that job is just an
[2:05:04] assignment.
[2:05:07] It's just a beginning.
[2:05:10] Whatever any of you has as a job,
[2:05:14] it is not a job. It is a test.
[2:05:17] It's a test of stewardship.
[2:05:20] It's a test of faithfulness.
[2:05:22] I tell you what, brother, sister.
[2:05:24] Hallelujah. When you are faithful,
[2:05:28] God will give you another one.
[2:05:32] Amen.
[2:05:33] Amen.
[2:05:35] And another one. And another one.
[2:05:38] pray for me because there are many
[2:05:40] things I want to say and I I want to use
[2:05:41] my time well.
[2:05:44] He he can give you a talent,
[2:05:48] a talent, a gift, you know, maybe a
[2:05:52] ministry
[2:05:54] and something you are doing for the
[2:05:55] Lord.
[2:05:57] You know, some of you can give you
[2:05:59] influence.
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:02] Do you know there are some good
[2:06:03] influencers?
[2:06:07] Praise God.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; There's a young man who had, you know,
[2:06:13] he was, and I don't encourage you young
[2:06:15] people to use Tik Tok or some of these,
[2:06:18] [Music]
[2:06:20] but there one who had a big following
[2:06:24] when he was not a believer yet. And you
[2:06:28] know, so so when one brother saw it, he
[2:06:31] told him, "Why are you not using your
[2:06:33] account?"
[2:06:35] He said, "No, I left those things
[2:06:36] because I believed."
[2:06:39] Brother, you are not getting the idea.
[2:06:41] You are an influencer. Use the platform
[2:06:43] to spread the message.
[2:06:49] Some of you, God has given you
[2:06:50] influence.
[2:06:53] When you speak, people follow you.
[2:06:56] Some people believe you.
[2:07:00] And some of you use that influence for
[2:07:02] gossip.
[2:07:06] breaking friendships and families.
[2:07:08] Use that influence
[2:07:11] knowing it is a trust God has put in
[2:07:12] your hand.
[2:07:16] It's not your own.
[2:07:19] Whatever you have is not yours.
[2:07:21] It's a property on loan.
[2:07:26] Praise God. Amen. And there is no one
[2:07:30] here can say I have nothing.
[2:07:39] Every one of us has something.
[2:07:42] You go in the Bible and check. When God
[2:07:46] came to Moses, he asked him, "What do
[2:07:49] you have?" He had something.
[2:07:52] Praise his God. Amen. When you go in the
[2:07:55] Bible, you find Elisha. He came to the
[2:07:59] woman who was praying and crying.
[2:08:02] Oh, I have nothing. I am a poor widow.
[2:08:05] My husband is dead. He was a servant of
[2:08:08] God. Say, stop crying about what you
[2:08:11] have lost.
[2:08:13] And the prophet asked her a question.
[2:08:16] What do you have? And she said, I have a
[2:08:20] little cruise of oil.
[2:08:23] Say that will be enough.
[2:08:26] Let me tell you, whatever you have.
[2:08:29] Whatever you need, you have.
[2:08:32] Because whatever you need to come out of
[2:08:34] what you have
[2:08:38] and you know you know this prophet
[2:08:40] Elijah came to another woman
[2:08:44] I think we of Zerapath and
[2:08:47] Asa what do you have said give me
[2:08:50] something to drink he said no
[2:08:54] I've got to bring water say no wait
[2:08:56] bring al something to eat
[2:08:59] I don't have food for
[2:09:01] I only have for me and my son for one
[2:09:04] time and we die. In other words, I have
[2:09:06] no food. He said, you you think what you
[2:09:09] have is for you,
[2:09:12] but but the idea was
[2:09:14] if you use what you have for you,
[2:09:18] if you think it is yours
[2:09:21] to consume,
[2:09:23] you will consume it and die.
[2:09:29] I can't give to land fund. I can't give
[2:09:31] offering. I can't give ti. I can't
[2:09:33] because I don't have enough.
[2:09:35] None has enough.
[2:09:39] No one ever has enough.
[2:09:42] Brother, sister, read your Bible very
[2:09:44] well.
[2:09:46] People that God used to do mighty
[2:09:48] things.
[2:09:50] They began with something small
[2:09:54] but they had faith
[2:09:57] in the unseen.
[2:10:00] Amen. You talk about that woman. You
[2:10:02] know the prophet told her don't explain
[2:10:05] to me stories.
[2:10:08] Just give me what I'm saying. And that's
[2:10:10] what God is saying. What you have is not
[2:10:13] yours.
[2:10:15] What you have you have it as a trustee.
[2:10:19] is given to you to use for his glory.
[2:10:26] Your job is not yours.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Your wife is not yours. Your husband is
[2:10:29] not yours. Your child is not yours. Your
[2:10:32] gift is not yours. Your ministry,
[2:10:34] whatever, it's not yours. Your money is
[2:10:38] not yours.
[2:10:40] Whatever you have, Amen. is for the Lord
[2:10:42] to receive glory.
[2:10:44] But the question is, will you receive
[2:10:47] the revelation?
[2:10:49] because you can Oh, hallelujah. You
[2:10:52] cannot go to the next step.
[2:10:56] The next phase will not come for you
[2:11:00] until you receive the revelation
[2:11:04] of what I have
[2:11:07] is not mine. It is for the Lord is
[2:11:09] glory.
[2:11:11] So, let me serve the Lord and I will
[2:11:14] live by faith. If I die, I die.
[2:11:20] I have no transport to church.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Let me walk. If I die, I die.
[2:11:28] Some of us, there was a time we would
[2:11:32] walk to church,
[2:11:35] praying and believing
[2:11:38] that we will find some money on the
[2:11:40] ground.
[2:11:45] Maybe you have never experienced that.
[2:11:47] But some of us experience it.
[2:11:50] You are walking 60 kilome 6 km
[2:11:55] and the dust that is a dusty road.
[2:11:59] But you are believing you even pray
[2:12:02] before you start the journey.
[2:12:05] God open a door
[2:12:07] at least let me pick 5,000 or something
[2:12:11] so I can have money for border
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; and for offering. You are even not
[2:12:17] asking God to give you money for you to
[2:12:19] enjoy. You are asking for him to give
[2:12:20] you money to serve him.
[2:12:26] And I tell you, God is has a sense of
[2:12:28] humor.
[2:12:31] You know, he would take you through that
[2:12:34] and you know what money would come.
[2:12:37] You're walking and you know you don't
[2:12:39] walk looking up. You walk looking down.
[2:12:44] But adventure you may miss to see the
[2:12:46] money
[2:12:52] experiences.
[2:12:54] You understand what I'm talking about
[2:12:57] and you are walking looking down.
[2:13:00] One time I didn't have transport
[2:13:04] and I said prayed to God
[2:13:06] will provide. I don't want to miss the
[2:13:08] service.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; So by faith I prepared myself got my
[2:13:12] Bible
[2:13:14] started walking with my neck tie and
[2:13:16] everything. Of course, when a car passes
[2:13:22] you become baptized in dust,
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; but he said it's all right. After all, I
[2:13:29] know I was smart, but it's the dust.
[2:13:33] And then I I prayed for 5,000.
[2:13:38] I picked 50,000.
[2:13:44] Now, of course, the the non-believers
[2:13:47] are telling me now it's not your money.
[2:13:48] You have picked it. You have to take it
[2:13:49] to police. Come on.
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:57] My friend, the God of Peter is my Peter.
[2:14:00] He's my God.
[2:14:02] The God who told him, "Go open the first
[2:14:05] fish's mouth.
[2:14:09] remove money from the mouth of the fish.
[2:14:14] He picked the money.
[2:14:18] God threw it there.
[2:14:21] You're talking about what? I'm talking
[2:14:24] about faith
[2:14:27] and you would pay your tithe and you
[2:14:30] will use for transport for several days.
[2:14:32] Transport.
[2:14:34] Praise God. I'm talking about
[2:14:36] faithfulness
[2:14:39] and and having this understanding.
[2:14:42] What I have is not mine.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; What do you have? Say I have nothing.
[2:14:47] No, you don't have nothing.
[2:14:51] Turn to your neighbor. Tell them you
[2:14:52] don't have nothing.
[2:14:57] So what do you have? Maybe you have your
[2:14:59] two feet.
[2:15:01] There is someone who can't walk but you
[2:15:04] you can walk. So maybe you have that.
[2:15:09] Begin with that and the Lord will see
[2:15:12] you and will see your faithfulness. And
[2:15:16] when you go back again,
[2:15:19] he will power more. He will power more.
[2:15:22] He'll power more. And before you know
[2:15:24] it, you the Bible says they ate for many
[2:15:27] days.
[2:15:30] Serving God will never make you lose.
[2:15:35] Giving to the Lord will never make you
[2:15:37] lose.
[2:15:39] It will make you prosper.
[2:15:43] [Applause]
[2:15:45] Amen. Whatever you have is a property on
[2:15:49] loan.
[2:15:51] 1 Timothy 6:20,
[2:15:54] Paul tells Timothy, "Keep that which is
[2:15:56] committed to thy trust."
[2:16:05] Gifts and calling and the calling of God
[2:16:07] are without repentance.
[2:16:11] Did you hear that?
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; God has given you something
[2:16:15] even by birth,
[2:16:18] not because you pleased him.
[2:16:20] So what do you have? Some of you you
[2:16:23] have some wisdom of and the ability of
[2:16:26] doing certain things
[2:16:31] but you can't bring it to the work of
[2:16:33] God.
[2:16:36] Why
[2:16:38] bring your wisdom? God has given it to
[2:16:40] you. Some of you are gifted. Some of you
[2:16:44] sisters and brothers, you are gifted.
[2:16:46] If you have something like a youth camp,
[2:16:49] what can you do?
[2:16:52] What can you bring to the table?
[2:16:54] Make yourself a useful member of the
[2:16:56] body of Christ.
[2:17:00] But some believers, they're very doant.
[2:17:04] They will never do anything.
[2:17:07] Never do anything. There's a problem.
[2:17:11] And that's why you remain stagnant.
[2:17:17] All the time you're sorry for yourself,
[2:17:20] brothers. Time to be sorry for yourself
[2:17:23] is over. Come on another level.
[2:17:26] Come higher. Amen. Increase your
[2:17:28] revelation to a place
[2:17:31] for where you will understand. I have
[2:17:34] something I can do.
[2:17:37] Hallelujah. He said, therefore, a
[2:17:40] certain noble man went into a far
[2:17:42] country to receive for himself a
[2:17:43] kingdom.
[2:17:48] and then to return. And he called his 10
[2:17:51] servants
[2:17:53] and delivered unto them£10
[2:17:57] and said unto them, "Occupy
[2:18:00] till I come.
[2:18:02] Occupy till I come."
[2:18:07] Whatever he has given you is not yours
[2:18:10] to own
[2:18:12] but it is to glorify
[2:18:14] himself through you
[2:18:16] through that.
[2:18:20] Praise God. Whatever he has given you. I
[2:18:24] feel like some people are not getting
[2:18:26] it.
[2:18:29] Come out of the canality.
[2:18:32] Come to a spiritual level of
[2:18:33] understanding.
[2:18:38] Amen.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Whatever God has given you,
[2:18:43] whatever
[2:18:45] is not yours to own,
[2:18:47] [Music]
[2:18:49] it is for you to glorify God through
[2:18:52] that thing.
[2:18:58] Your carmen,
[2:19:00] your bicycle, your motorcycle,
[2:19:03] your wife, Amen.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Your husband,
[2:19:09] your child,
[2:19:11] your job.
[2:19:13] Are you hearing me? Whatever you have is
[2:19:16] not yours. It is for God's glory.
[2:19:21] But it comes by revelation.
[2:19:25] One time God comes to a man
[2:19:28] called Abraham and he tells him, "Abi
[2:19:30] man,
[2:19:34] give me your ch your son.
[2:19:38] Give me your son.
[2:19:44] Let us be sincere. How many of you can
[2:19:46] give out your children?
[2:19:49] It is the only son you have." God has a
[2:19:52] a sense of humor. He always comes to ask
[2:19:53] you for the only little thing you can
[2:20:03] grew yourself on it you want change.
[2:20:09] Am I sharing the word?
[2:20:12] But when you give it
[2:20:16] not okay okay okay okay
[2:20:18] no no no
[2:20:21] God loves a cheerful
[2:20:25] all right God
[2:20:30] how many can do that many of us we can't
[2:20:37] okay
[2:20:40] but Abraham
[2:20:43] was not sad. You read the Bible very
[2:20:45] well. When God told him, "Give me your
[2:20:48] son."
[2:20:50] Abraham quickly understood
[2:20:53] this boy come from God. Amen. Is not
[2:20:57] mine is for God, God promised me to have
[2:21:01] a long generation.
[2:21:04] I don't know how he will do it. But what
[2:21:06] I know, he promised me he will do it.
[2:21:10] Therefore, whatever he has given me, I
[2:21:12] am happy to give it back to you. That's
[2:21:15] why no matter what Abraham did,
[2:21:18] God told God said Abraham had faith,
[2:21:22] Abraham staggered not
[2:21:25] staggered not
[2:21:27] but didn't stagger.
[2:21:29] He really staggered
[2:21:33] when he went with you know what is the
[2:21:36] name of that woman?
[2:21:44] Why did he go back to God again when God
[2:21:48] had told him
[2:21:50] it is with Sarah
[2:21:52] and Sarah suggested
[2:21:55] let's do this Abraham
[2:21:57] maybe it is through my maiden
[2:22:00] God meant
[2:22:02] he said okay God what what he said do
[2:22:04] what your wife said
[2:22:06] why didn't he ask God to begin
[2:22:09] He knew it was wrong. He knew what the
[2:22:12] word said. But you know what? When you
[2:22:16] do, there's something that you can do.
[2:22:20] God will forget everything else you have
[2:22:22] done.
[2:22:25] You know, God saw only one thing that
[2:22:28] when it came to the son of promise,
[2:22:31] Abraham did not stagger in him.
[2:22:35] He believed this child is from God.
[2:22:38] Therefore, if God wants the child, I'm
[2:22:42] willing and ready to give this child.
[2:22:45] He staggered not. And that's what is
[2:22:47] written about Abraham.
[2:22:50] Brother Henry, then time comes
[2:22:54] when he was going to take this chance
[2:22:56] child for sacrifice.
[2:22:59] I want you to watch.
[2:23:01] This is what we call revelation.
[2:23:04] By faith, Abraham, by revelation,
[2:23:06] Abraham,
[2:23:08] papa, we have the fire.
[2:23:12] But where is the sacrifice?
[2:23:14] Who remembers what Abraham said?
[2:23:17] What did he say?
[2:23:20] God, everybody say it. God will provide
[2:23:24] for himself.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:30] Hallelujah. Abraham right there. He
[2:23:34] created a sacrifice.
[2:23:37] He created by his action. He created by
[2:23:40] his words. He created by his faith.
[2:23:44] And God is always faithful to those who
[2:23:47] are faithful.
[2:23:51] When he he went to kill his son,
[2:23:54] God told him, Abraham, don't do it.
[2:23:57] And then there was a ship.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; And then there was a ship.
[2:24:02] Some of you, you are giving your best to
[2:24:04] the Lord.
[2:24:06] You are you are giving yourself to the
[2:24:08] Lord unreservedly.
[2:24:11] You know, it may not be all of you, but
[2:24:13] some of you for sure.
[2:24:15] I have a word for you this morning.
[2:24:18] Hallelujah. If you're giving yourself to
[2:24:20] the Lord and reserve,
[2:24:23] he will provide a sacrifice.
[2:24:27] He will provide what you never expected.
[2:24:31] Expect surprising.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. God is going to surprise
[2:24:37] some of you. I said God is going to
[2:24:40] surprise some of you. God is going to
[2:24:42] surprise some of you because God has a
[2:24:46] way of doing more than we expected,
[2:24:51] abundantly,
[2:24:53] exceeding our thoughts,
[2:24:56] exceeding our ideas.
[2:24:58] That is what our God does.
[2:25:02] Someone help me to say hallelujah.
[2:25:04] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; You are not your own.
[2:25:11] [Music]
[2:25:14] In the Queen of the South, Brother Bam
[2:25:16] says, "If God has given you the message
[2:25:17] of speaking with tongues,
[2:25:19] [Music]
[2:25:23] you have to help me and preach this,
[2:25:25] brother." Cuz I don't want an
[2:25:26] interpreter. I want a fellow preacher
[2:25:27] this morning cuz I have a lot. I told
[2:25:29] you I have a lot. If God has given you
[2:25:31] the message of speaking with tongues,
[2:25:34] do it. If God has put in your hands to
[2:25:38] interpret,
[2:25:41] do it. Praise God. If God has put in
[2:25:45] your hands to testify,
[2:25:48] come on church, do it. If God is put in
[2:25:52] your hands to preach,
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; preach what you've got. Let go.
[2:25:59] [Music]
[2:26:00] Hallelujah.
[2:26:03] What you've got, let go.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember some years ago I think
[2:26:10] it's now years one person came and told
[2:26:12] me pastor I always feel like speaking in
[2:26:15] tong
[2:26:17] and then I hold it.
[2:26:21] I said come on let go.
[2:26:25] And here is what our prophet said. If
[2:26:27] you if God has given you in your heart
[2:26:29] speak in tong let go
[2:26:34] your amens are small. Are you Roman
[2:26:36] Catholics?
[2:26:38] Are you Baptist? Baptist?
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in speaking in tongues?
[2:26:42] If God has put you to speak in tones,
[2:26:45] let go.
[2:26:48] If God has given you interpreting, let
[2:26:50] go.
[2:27:04] Let go.
[2:27:06] Amen.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of God is, there is
[2:27:09] liberty.
[2:27:12] If God put in your hand to testify,
[2:27:18] testify. Let God do it.
[2:27:21] If God has put in your hands to preach,
[2:27:23] pray.
[2:27:25] Whatever you've got, let go.
[2:27:30] Tell your neighbor, "Let go."
[2:27:32] Come on. Tell them, "Let go.
[2:27:35] Let go.
[2:27:37] Oh, glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah.
[2:27:41] Hallelujah. If God has put money in your
[2:27:43] hands, let go.
[2:27:47] If God has put a job, whatever it is,
[2:27:49] let go for his glory.
[2:27:54] as I said last evening.
[2:27:58] How dare men or women, you have no right
[2:28:01] to do those things. You are you are
[2:28:03] bought.
[2:28:05] You are bought.
[2:28:09] [Music]
[2:28:10] You are not your own.
[2:28:13] But you are bought with the price of the
[2:28:15] precious blood of Jesus.
[2:28:19] And you are not your own.
[2:28:22] [Music]
[2:28:23] to throw your life away and to live the
[2:28:26] way you do.
[2:28:30] You have no right to live the way you
[2:28:31] want.
[2:28:34] You are not your own.
[2:28:37] You have an owner.
[2:28:40] Even your life, you are just a trustee.
[2:28:46] You are just keeping it for somebody.
[2:28:49] Somebody the owner.
[2:28:52] Amen. Who is the owner? The one who gave
[2:28:54] it. You are a trustee of your life.
[2:28:59] You have no right to live the way you
[2:29:00] want.
[2:29:03] You were bought with the precious blood
[2:29:06] of Jesus and you are not your own.
[2:29:10] Praise God.
[2:29:12] You have no legal rights to take that
[2:29:14] life that Christ has bought and sell it
[2:29:16] to the devil.
[2:29:20] You have no rights to do it. And as I
[2:29:23] said, that thirsting,
[2:29:26] that thirst that you're feeling.
[2:29:30] God made you with that thirst.
[2:29:34] That's a part of God.
[2:29:37] God is make up for you.
[2:29:41] He made you and give you a thirst,
[2:29:45] a thirst for him.
[2:29:47] But but then listen. He says, "But you
[2:29:49] try to satisfy that thirst with worldly
[2:29:52] amusement.
[2:29:57] You see, dancing
[2:30:01] drinking,
[2:30:03] smoking,
[2:30:04] gambling,
[2:30:06] lrying
[2:30:08] to satisfy that blessed holy fast with
[2:30:11] the things of the world.
[2:30:16] And listen, he says, you have no right
[2:30:21] to do it. And you are cheating and
[2:30:24] robbing God by doing so.
[2:30:30] Younger people who are here, you have no
[2:30:33] right going to those dances.
[2:30:37] You are not your own.
[2:30:40] As long as you are a bloodboat child of
[2:30:43] God,
[2:30:46] you even have no right going to those
[2:30:48] dance clubs and
[2:30:51] those beer parties.
[2:30:55] Philistine kind of dances.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; You also go there and begin
[2:31:03] you have bad such a bad trusting
[2:31:08] [Music]
[2:31:10] you see drinking,
[2:31:12] smoking, gambling last
[2:31:16] you you don't have a right.
[2:31:22] So the ones who say I have a right to do
[2:31:24] what I want. It's my body
[2:31:29] even
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; because the devil owns their bodies and
[2:31:35] their spirit and their soul.
[2:31:39] But the devil never bought it.
[2:31:43] So they own it.
[2:31:46] They're just floating everywhere.
[2:31:50] They have no place overboard.
[2:31:53] But to a son of God, to a daughter of
[2:31:55] God,
[2:31:57] someone purchas
[2:31:58] [Music]
[2:32:01] someone.
[2:32:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:32:08] I said I'm someone who someone.
[2:32:13] So when the devil come to fight against
[2:32:16] me, I will always tell him you don't
[2:32:19] know what you are fighting with.
[2:32:22] Because I have someone that paid and
[2:32:25] bowed me. I don't own myself.
[2:32:30] If you are against me, you against him.
[2:32:33] He's the owner of everything I have.
[2:32:36] Everything I am. It is for his glory.
[2:32:41] I am someone.
[2:32:45] That's why there are certain things we
[2:32:47] cannot do.
[2:32:50] Why? Not because we can't do it but
[2:32:53] because we are cognizant of this fact
[2:32:55] that we are trustees.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now let me let me quickly now take
[2:33:04] you through the different life seasons
[2:33:09] of of of stewardship.
[2:33:16] Life seasons of stewardship.
[2:33:23] Praise God.
[2:33:26] Can you open Ephesians 5:25? Husbands,
[2:33:29] love your wives even as Christ also
[2:33:30] loved the church, and he gave himself
[2:33:31] for it, that he might sanctify and
[2:33:34] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[2:33:36] by the word,
[2:33:38] that he might present it to himself a
[2:33:39] glorious church,
[2:33:41] not having spinkle,
[2:33:43] or any such thing, but that he should be
[2:33:46] holy and without blemish.
[2:33:49] men to love their wives as their own
[2:33:50] bodies.
[2:33:53] He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
[2:33:56] For no man ever yet hated his own flesh,
[2:33:59] but nourishes and cherishes it and given
[2:34:01] as unto the Lord the church. For we are
[2:34:03] the members of his body,
[2:34:06] of his flesh, of his bones.
[2:34:10] For this cause shall a man leave his
[2:34:14] father
[2:34:16] and mother
[2:34:18] and shall be joined unto his wife
[2:34:21] and they two shall be one flesh.
[2:34:24] This is a great mystery.
[2:34:28] But I speak concerning Christ and the
[2:34:29] child.
[2:34:32] Marriage is not ownership.
[2:34:40] I don't I don't want anyone to miss
[2:34:41] this. So if you I'm going to call your
[2:34:42] name.
[2:34:47] Marriage is not ownership.
[2:34:51] It's a secret trust.
[2:34:55] You see in Africa here we thought that
[2:34:59] marriage is ownership.
[2:35:03] You know that's why men usually beat
[2:35:07] their wives with with with rods
[2:35:15] they beat children and even the mother
[2:35:17] whatever the wife does
[2:35:20] that kind of behavior
[2:35:23] it's like as if
[2:35:26] you
[2:35:29] a true bornagain believer
[2:35:34] will not follow these cultural things of
[2:35:36] saying I want 10 cows 20 cows.
[2:35:41] Please I'm preaching this for my
[2:35:43] generation.
[2:35:46] Don't tell your fathers I said this.
[2:35:50] This is for you and your children.
[2:35:53] If you're truly born again,
[2:35:56] you are not going to begin saying a
[2:35:57] young man who is filled with the Holy
[2:35:59] Ghost, I want 50 cows, 20 cows, 30.
[2:36:03] No, they are not buying your daughter.
[2:36:08] Why? Because she doesn't belong to you.
[2:36:12] Someone gave her to you as a steward
[2:36:18] for you to raise her in the fear of God
[2:36:22] until she finds a God-given husband.
[2:36:27] When the husband comes, he's not the
[2:36:30] owner too. Amen. Who is the owner? The
[2:36:34] one who bought her with a price.
[2:36:37] Praise God. That's why he came and died.
[2:36:42] But no man can physically die for his
[2:36:44] wife.
[2:36:47] But he died for his bride. And when he
[2:36:51] did, he did for all of us.
[2:36:55] So no one owns anybody.
[2:36:58] Your wife. Wait. Wait.
[2:37:02] The mentality
[2:37:05] that she's my daughter. I own her.
[2:37:08] [Music]
[2:37:09] Therefore, they must pay me 50 cows.
[2:37:13] Is the reason why men in Africa beat
[2:37:16] their wives?
[2:37:20] Because they also feel their own heart.
[2:37:26] Do you know how much I bought?
[2:37:28] Do you know how much I suffered?
[2:37:31] Do you know what I paid? But you
[2:37:33] brothers,
[2:37:35] when your children grow, your daughters
[2:37:38] and then you get them to get married,
[2:37:42] you are cognizant of the fact you are
[2:37:44] just a steward.
[2:37:48] You you you don't need any payment.
[2:37:51] If this young man wants to appreciate
[2:37:53] you for raising a well, if he's wise
[2:37:55] enough, he will do it.
[2:38:02] Praise God. And when he takes her, he
[2:38:05] doesn't own her.
[2:38:10] That is why men who don't understand.
[2:38:15] They have a lot of rules and
[2:38:17] regulations.
[2:38:21] They will put laws
[2:38:24] and oppress
[2:38:26] and the woman cannot say anything.
[2:38:29] She doesn't
[2:38:30] because she's a woman
[2:38:35] in Christ
[2:38:37] neither male nor female. We are all
[2:38:40] owned by him equally. We are all
[2:38:45] I am sorry if your traditions are bigger
[2:38:47] than the word.
[2:38:51] But I'm preaching the word this morning.
[2:38:54] Praise God. Tradition has its place
[2:38:58] and I have I'm not against it at all.
[2:39:01] I'm not against it.
[2:39:03] Praise God.
[2:39:05] I paid my bride price.
[2:39:09] I paid my bride price.
[2:39:11] It was a requirement of the fathers.
[2:39:16] But
[2:39:17] I have a revelation.
[2:39:23] Even the other time I had the
[2:39:24] revelation.
[2:39:27] She doesn't belong to me.
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; She belongs to the Lord.
[2:39:33] [Music]
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; So marriage
[2:39:36] is a secret trust.
[2:39:41] God puts a wife or a husband in your
[2:39:43] hand
[2:39:46] to see if you can reflect Christ and the
[2:39:48] church.
[2:39:52] Faithful stewardship in marriage
[2:39:55] is expressed in the atmosphere you build
[2:39:58] in your home.
[2:40:02] The atmosphere of prayer,
[2:40:04] the atmosphere of respect, mutual
[2:40:07] respect.
[2:40:09] [Music]
[2:40:10] unity.
[2:40:13] The husband is doing this, the wife is
[2:40:16] doing it. The home is divided,
[2:40:19] that home has no Christ.
[2:40:22] But a home that has Christ is always
[2:40:24] united in Christ.
[2:40:27] If you are both in Christ, you will be
[2:40:30] united. He say you don't own your
[2:40:32] spouse. You are just and you are
[2:40:34] accountable for how you represent Christ
[2:40:36] to your to your spouse.
[2:40:41] [Music]
[2:40:44] Praise God.
[2:40:46] How do you represent Christ to your
[2:40:47] wife?
[2:40:51] How do you represent Christ to your
[2:40:52] husband?
[2:40:56] Did you know that these things are this
[2:40:57] deep
[2:41:01] or you thought it's just marriage?
[2:41:07] Genesis 18.
[2:41:09] I wish I had time. I would go on and
[2:41:11] talk more about carry on. And the Lord
[2:41:14] said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that
[2:41:17] that thing which I which I do,
[2:41:23] seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[2:41:25] a great and mighty nation,
[2:41:28] and all the nations of the earth shall
[2:41:29] be blessed in him.
[2:41:32] For I know him that he will command his
[2:41:35] children,
[2:41:36] and he is a household after him, and
[2:41:39] they shall keep the way of the Lord."
[2:41:43] Now let me read it again. If you have
[2:41:45] children, listen carefully. I said
[2:41:48] listen carefully.
[2:41:51] This is what God thinks about Abraham.
[2:41:54] Can I hide anything from Abraham?
[2:41:57] For I know him
[2:42:00] that he will command his children
[2:42:04] and his household
[2:42:07] after him.
[2:42:11] after him. He will command them to be
[2:42:13] like him
[2:42:16] and they shall keep the way of the Lord.
[2:42:21] I don't know about you, brother, sister,
[2:42:24] but I want God to say this about you. I
[2:42:27] know I know him very well. He will raise
[2:42:30] his children the way of the Lord.
[2:42:33] Come on now. I know. I know. I want you
[2:42:37] should desire God to speak your name
[2:42:38] like that.
[2:42:41] I know him. Why? Because he's a good
[2:42:44] steward.
[2:42:47] Amen. Why those children are given to
[2:42:50] you?
[2:42:52] Because God has trusted you
[2:42:56] to raise them well. But many believers
[2:42:59] begin to put cartoons for their
[2:43:01] children.
[2:43:04] Cartoons that are completely way off.
[2:43:09] Take time to watch what your children
[2:43:10] are watching.
[2:43:14] See what they're feeding on.
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; 3 years they're feeding on love stories.
[2:43:23] What seed are they eating?
[2:43:26] You a father, a mother, you're doing
[2:43:27] that.
[2:43:30] How can God trust you?
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; That's what Christian parenthood is.
[2:43:40] Watch what your children are feeding on.
[2:43:43] Watch the the children they playing
[2:43:45] with.
[2:43:47] Watch the games they playing.
[2:43:50] It's not control. It is stewardship.
[2:44:01] The neighbors are nonbelievers.
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; The neighbors watch B. Before you know
[2:44:09] it, your children will come backing
[2:44:10] back.
[2:44:13] One time I went with my daughter to one
[2:44:15] of the Indian, you know, homes
[2:44:19] and before I knew it, children, let me
[2:44:21] tell you, they are so fast.
[2:44:24] They will reach where you will not reach
[2:44:25] in a moment.
[2:44:28] Just in a minute I was speaking with
[2:44:30] this Indian
[2:44:33] where what is she worshiping? She was I
[2:44:36] think about four five years.
[2:44:39] So I looked and she was in a small
[2:44:42] shrine
[2:44:44] of their small god and you know there
[2:44:47] was this woman there worshiping the the
[2:44:49] idols
[2:44:51] with some fire and smoke and incense and
[2:44:54] everything and idols and
[2:44:58] So I found her there said so she she was
[2:45:02] telling her also to sit and you know
[2:45:03] also you know join inh
[2:45:08] I said not my child come out
[2:45:12] that's how parents have to be
[2:45:15] watch out for your children
[2:45:18] it is it is a right God has given to you
[2:45:23] I expected mothers and fathers to shout
[2:45:25] amen
[2:45:28] That's why a believer's home
[2:45:31] is not supposed to be like the worldly
[2:45:33] homes
[2:45:35] where TV raises the children.
[2:45:40] DVF, help me to preach this message now
[2:45:44] and you are putting TV
[2:45:48] because you don't want children to
[2:45:49] disturb you
[2:45:52] and they are watching their morning to
[2:45:54] evening.
[2:45:56] You don't even know what they watch
[2:45:59] in the home of a believer. TV should
[2:46:02] never raise children.
[2:46:05] Watch what you you you are you are you
[2:46:08] are a steward. You as a parent.
[2:46:11] You you are given this sacred trust of
[2:46:14] these children.
[2:46:17] And you are supposed to raise them
[2:46:20] in the fear of God, in the way of the
[2:46:23] Lord, in the way of the word.
[2:46:27] Praise God.
[2:46:29] Malachi 2:15.
[2:46:32] And did not he make one, yet had the
[2:46:35] residue of the spirit and wherefore one,
[2:46:37] that he might seek a godly seed.
[2:46:44] [Music]
[2:46:49] Praise God.
[2:46:51] Adam and Eve and the purpose was that he
[2:46:54] will have a godly seed.
[2:46:57] When God looks at marriage,
[2:47:00] God looks at a godly seed.
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; Look at it this way. If you marry an
[2:47:08] unbeliever,
[2:47:10] you entangle.
[2:47:13] You are yoking yourself with two you are
[2:47:15] two equal unequal powers yoking
[2:47:18] yourself.
[2:47:22] You can never raise a godly seed.
[2:47:27] But you see God wants you to marry a
[2:47:30] believer
[2:47:33] that you may raise a godly seed.
[2:47:38] Train up a child in the way he should
[2:47:40] go.
[2:47:43] when he is old, he will not depart from
[2:47:46] me. We have a married couple meeting
[2:47:48] next weekend or
[2:47:52] there are certain things that I I will
[2:47:53] reserve and speak then
[2:47:57] I think. Yeah, next weekend on on in the
[2:47:59] afternoon. So praying that just I'll
[2:48:02] spare you some of it and then I speak it
[2:48:04] then. But you see it is a sacred trust
[2:48:09] that a parent has.
[2:48:11] to raise a godly seed,
[2:48:14] to train up a child in the way he should
[2:48:16] go.
[2:48:19] Praise God.
[2:48:24] You see, if you look at Colossians 3, it
[2:48:26] says, "And whatsoever you do, do it
[2:48:29] heartly as unto the Lord
[2:48:32] and not unto men, and knowing that of
[2:48:35] the of the Lord shall ye receive the
[2:48:37] reward of the inheritance.
[2:48:44] I'm looking at stewards of influence and
[2:48:46] provision.
[2:48:50] If stewards of influence,
[2:48:55] stewards of provision, whatever you
[2:48:57] have,
[2:48:59] you see um the Lord,
[2:49:03] whatever you are doing as a job or
[2:49:05] whatever,
[2:49:08] remember you are serving the Lord.
[2:49:12] You see, every coin a believer earns is
[2:49:14] a testimony.
[2:49:21] And if you know that
[2:49:24] then that's why you give offering,
[2:49:27] that's why you pay your 10%.
[2:49:30] That's why we help others,
[2:49:33] not because we have a lot.
[2:49:36] All flows from understanding
[2:49:39] stewardship.
[2:49:42] By the way,
[2:49:44] let me tell you, it is easy for a person
[2:49:48] who has to give.
[2:49:50] [Music]
[2:49:54] But how did they get?
[2:49:57] I'm talking about a believer now.
[2:50:01] How did he get?
[2:50:03] By giving when he did not have.
[2:50:06] [Music]
[2:50:08] by revelation.
[2:50:10] It is stewardship
[2:50:12] to understand the little that I have.
[2:50:16] I give by sacrifice
[2:50:19] because even God himself,
[2:50:21] he gave everything he had. He loved the
[2:50:24] world that he gave.
[2:50:27] Whenever you love, you give.
[2:50:29] If you love the Lord with all your
[2:50:31] heart,
[2:50:32] you give him everything you have.
[2:50:35] When God increases you,
[2:50:38] it is a test so that to see if he can
[2:50:41] trust you
[2:50:43] with all the kingdom resources. The
[2:50:46] church must learn that the increase is
[2:50:48] for go the kingdom purpose.
[2:50:58] When God opens income doors for you,
[2:51:02] he watches you how you will handle what
[2:51:05] he belongs to him.
[2:51:09] How you talk, how you dress,
[2:51:12] how you behave at work,
[2:51:14] at home. It testifies of your
[2:51:17] stewardship.
[2:51:19] The Holy Ghost is not only to speak in
[2:51:21] tongues,
[2:51:23] but is to produce fruit
[2:51:25] to represent the owner. Our conduct is
[2:51:29] in society
[2:51:32] either draws souls or pushes them away.
[2:51:40] Each area is a sacred trust.
[2:51:45] You know, meant to express Christ's
[2:51:48] character,
[2:51:52] not listen. Oh God, help us.
[2:51:55] It is not meant to bring you personal
[2:51:58] success.
[2:52:03] It is meant to express the character of
[2:52:05] Christ.
[2:52:07] [Music]
[2:52:10] There are some people when you get
[2:52:11] something.
[2:52:13] You want to show everybody how
[2:52:15] successful you are
[2:52:19] because you bought a car.
[2:52:22] You will begin waving the key
[2:52:23] everywhere.
[2:52:30] Why? You know, I remember there was a
[2:52:33] time when cell phones had just started
[2:52:38] and
[2:52:40] mom must be remembering that man who
[2:52:42] used to pass around home
[2:52:44] and there used to be a neighborhood
[2:52:50] like he was maybe in his mid20s.
[2:52:54] And so he had this, you know, small
[2:52:57] phone. We used to call them block
[2:52:58] phones,
[2:53:00] &gt;&gt; you know, block phones.
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, he would be passing by
[2:53:08] home
[2:53:10] and you know, of course, everybody's on
[2:53:12] the ver and they seated.
[2:53:14] So he will remove the block of phone.
[2:53:18] Hey,
[2:53:21] no one is calling him.
[2:53:24] He's just trying to show that he has a
[2:53:25] phone.
[2:53:28] And we the little ones we
[2:53:31] shall also have a phone. So if you have
[2:53:34] a job or something good
[2:53:37] and you make believers feel like that,
[2:53:40] you are a bad steward.
[2:53:45] It's not to show your success.
[2:53:49] It is to show Christ's character.
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; Your job is not your destiny.
[2:53:57] It is your assignment.
[2:54:01] You have an assignment.
[2:54:03] Today you have this one. Tomorrow you're
[2:54:05] getting another one. I don't know about
[2:54:07] you, but for me, I want to be assigned
[2:54:10] from glory to glory to glory to glory to
[2:54:12] glory.
[2:54:15] the position you are in today,
[2:54:20] someone is praying for it.
[2:54:24] Therefore, for God to answer their
[2:54:27] prayer,
[2:54:30] he will have to remove you.
[2:54:33] But where you will go will be determined
[2:54:36] by your character
[2:54:41] and your understanding and revelation of
[2:54:43] stewardship.
[2:54:47] If you are proud, he will bring you back
[2:54:49] down and the other person will take the
[2:54:52] pain. But if you are humble,
[2:54:56] he will have to upgrade you.
[2:54:59] Some of you are going to get promotion.
[2:55:03] Not because you prayed but because
[2:55:05] someone else is praying.
[2:55:08] So for God to answer their prayers,
[2:55:11] he will have to remove you from that
[2:55:13] place and promote you there, promote
[2:55:16] them there so he can put you in another
[2:55:19] higher place.
[2:55:23] You know it's a body being blessed.
[2:55:29] Your family is not your possession.
[2:55:32] Some my wife, my family, my children, my
[2:55:35] my my
[2:55:37] is not yours. It is your stewardship.
[2:55:41] [Music]
[2:55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am determined friends. I got
[2:55:46] determined that I will serve the Lord,
[2:55:50] my wife will serve the Lord, my children
[2:55:53] will serve the Lord. And I tell you
[2:55:55] what, even when it comes to overnight,
[2:55:58] many times if I'm so weak or maybe
[2:56:02] sickly or tired or whatever
[2:56:05] and I I said I I just said tell my wife,
[2:56:07] I will not go today.
[2:56:10] Oh yes, I go through that sometimes.
[2:56:13] Every human being does. Said, dear, I
[2:56:15] will not go today.
[2:56:17] She said, it's all right. I understand.
[2:56:20] But then she begins to push me slowly
[2:56:23] but wisely.
[2:56:26] Now you're going to remain here. Demons
[2:56:27] may attack you.
[2:56:30] Let us go.
[2:56:31] And then she prepares herself.
[2:56:33] Everybody's going out.
[2:56:35] Are you sure you are not going?
[2:56:38] You are not going to enjoy here.
[2:56:41] And when it happens that she's the one
[2:56:43] who is weak
[2:56:46] especially when she's expecting
[2:56:49] those are weak moments. So I'm always
[2:56:51] the strong one also said are you sure
[2:56:53] you're going to remain
[2:56:56] I fear for you because for us we are
[2:56:58] going in the house of
[2:57:00] so is it with our children
[2:57:03] for those ones we are not even begging
[2:57:05] them.
[2:57:07] If it's time for church, it's time for
[2:57:10] everyone to go to church.
[2:57:13] Never let your children set their rules
[2:57:15] in your home.
[2:57:19] As long as they are in your house, you
[2:57:22] have a God-given responsibility
[2:57:26] like Abraham to make sure they serving
[2:57:29] God.
[2:57:32] You see, let me tell you, you read the
[2:57:34] book of Job. The Bible tells me that Job
[2:57:38] when things happened, he decided, you
[2:57:41] know, the Bible says he was always
[2:57:42] sacrificing
[2:57:45] for himself and his children. Is that
[2:57:48] true? Same thing with with others that
[2:57:52] we read of in the Bible, they always
[2:57:55] sacrificed for themselves
[2:57:57] and their children. That's why when it
[2:58:00] comes to the land fund of the church,
[2:58:03] I see a few families that do that.
[2:58:05] God bless you for doing that. I'm one of
[2:58:08] those. And you know, they pledged
[2:58:11] something for themselves
[2:58:13] and pledged for their children.
[2:58:16] Each of them
[2:58:19] &gt;&gt; because it is now your responsibility
[2:58:22] to bring them in the will of the Lord
[2:58:24] and they know me I give this much.
[2:58:29] I give this much. When it comes time for
[2:58:32] offerings,
[2:58:33] train them.
[2:58:35] Say don't go to God without an offering.
[2:58:39] Do you know some believers here don't
[2:58:41] know that
[2:58:43] if you read this Bible,
[2:58:46] it's not allowed
[2:58:48] to worship God without an offering.
[2:58:52] You read the Bible very well. There must
[2:58:54] be a sacrifice.
[2:58:58] Hallelujah.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when you come to church,
[2:59:01] come with your sacrifice
[2:59:04] and and teach the children
[2:59:06] to give their sacrifice.
[2:59:09] Everything in your hand is on God's lawn
[2:59:13] for his purpose.
[2:59:16] So I'm not I'm not here to fulfill my
[2:59:17] purpose,
[2:59:20] but to fulfill his purpose.
[2:59:24] We have time and give me about I know
[2:59:27] I'm a little over time 20 minutes I'll
[2:59:29] be done. Ephesians 5. Seeing then that
[2:59:32] ye walk circumspect circumspectly not as
[2:59:35] fools but as wise
[2:59:40] redeeming the time because the days are
[2:59:42] evil
[2:59:45] and we realize that we are at the end
[2:59:47] time.
[2:59:49] Nothing can go much longer.
[2:59:52] We are just wait. We are just waiting in
[2:59:54] borrowed time
[2:59:58] like it was in the days of Noah
[3:00:01] in the long suffering of God
[3:00:04] when the ark was being prepared
[3:00:07] only eight souls we are saved.
[3:00:10] So even as we don't have much time
[3:00:13] we are living on borrowed time.
[3:00:16] Tell your neighbor borrowed time.
[3:00:20] Borrowed time.
[3:00:23] And the Bible says while we are leaving
[3:00:26] we should not forsake the assembling of
[3:00:28] ourselves together
[3:00:30] as the manner of some is.
[3:00:33] So we are not in leisure.
[3:00:37] We are in harvest time.
[3:00:40] Every minute
[3:00:42] is accountable before God.
[3:00:47] Did you know some of us prostitute our
[3:00:49] time?
[3:00:54] We prostitute it.
[3:01:00] You go and begin scrolling.
[3:01:04] Social media is killing our generation.
[3:01:09] You may not want to say amen, but you
[3:01:11] know it is the truth
[3:01:14] and it is suffocating some of you.
[3:01:17] [Music]
[3:01:21] begin scrolling.
[3:01:23] You begin at 1 p.m.
[3:01:28] Before you know it, it is 3 p.m.
[3:01:32] [Music]
[3:01:34] The devil just treated you.
[3:01:38] Every minute you spend
[3:01:40] is accountable before God.
[3:01:44] God doesn't waste time.
[3:01:46] He expects fruit
[3:01:48] in every tree he has planted.
[3:01:51] You remember what what happened in the
[3:01:53] Bible in Luke Luke 13. He said, "Cut
[3:01:57] down this tree."
[3:01:59] Because when he plants a tree,
[3:02:03] he expects fruit.
[3:02:06] Time management is spiritual warfare.
[3:02:10] [Music]
[3:02:12] The devil or you know what is in the
[3:02:14] business of keeping believers busy busy
[3:02:16] busy
[3:02:19] busy with the wrong things.
[3:02:23] Come on church spend time with God
[3:02:28] and I'm preaching to myself too. Let us
[3:02:31] fight this battle.
[3:02:33] Let us come to church when we have we
[3:02:35] can
[3:02:37] fight the battle. Let the devil fight
[3:02:40] you while you are fighting back
[3:02:42] because remember you are a steward.
[3:02:45] You are going to be asked how you use
[3:02:47] your time.
[3:02:50] You know I may stand here and preach to
[3:02:51] you and you feel like I'm taking your
[3:02:53] time.
[3:02:55] But I tell you there is coming a day
[3:02:58] when whatever you think you are going to
[3:02:59] do out there will not matter anymore.
[3:03:05] And you will desire to spend one minute
[3:03:10] in the presence of God before the
[3:03:12] rapture.
[3:03:14] But time will be no more. And let me
[3:03:17] tell you, it is coming to the closing
[3:03:19] moment
[3:03:22] and time is coming when the rapture has
[3:03:25] happened and all of you were joking
[3:03:28] around,
[3:03:30] you will remain behind.
[3:03:35] Do you know remaining behind when you
[3:03:36] know what has happened?
[3:03:42] [Music]
[3:03:44] &gt;&gt; You will come
[3:03:46] and will tell you
[3:03:54] where is the pastor?
[3:04:01] What is it brother?
[3:04:04] &gt;&gt; Who should I call sincure
[3:04:18] has happened
[3:04:21] now? You will be swallowing your tears.
[3:04:25] But I tell you that
[3:04:33] preach for me for 3 hours.
[3:04:37] But you could not even get him for one
[3:04:39] minute.
[3:04:41] If you can still sit down and listen to
[3:04:42] the word
[3:04:45] rather listen to the word with joy
[3:04:49] because you have been given this time
[3:04:50] &gt;&gt; as a steward
[3:04:53] time.
[3:04:55] Time stewardship is a very important
[3:05:02] now
[3:05:04] on Wednesday
[3:05:07] because if I go in that area I'm not
[3:05:09] going to finish now.
[3:05:10] [Music]
[3:05:12] I was going to go into uh the sacred
[3:05:14] virtues
[3:05:17] that also God has given to a woman
[3:05:20] and we will talk about that on
[3:05:21] Wednesday.
[3:05:23] But I want to finish with a certain
[3:05:26] quote in the invisible union of the
[3:05:28] bride of Christ.
[3:05:31] It says that we are given a sacred
[3:05:33] virtue
[3:05:36] [Music]
[3:05:38] to stay virgin to the word
[3:05:43] as a woman is to stay virtuous to her
[3:05:45] husband.
[3:05:49] It's a sacred trust
[3:05:51] to honor to honor her Lord's word. We
[3:05:55] the church, we are given to honor the
[3:05:57] Lord's word above every man made clean.
[3:06:04] Above every wisdom denominations,
[3:06:08] the church is given that trust.
[3:06:12] Now we have a sacred trust,
[3:06:14] [Music]
[3:06:16] an inheritance,
[3:06:18] a heritage that we inherit
[3:06:21] as believing children. It is a sacred
[3:06:24] trust. And that sac trust and our sacred
[3:06:28] heritage is the word of God
[3:06:34] that's been given to us. The full word
[3:06:37] of God.
[3:06:39] The word itself is the vitamin.
[3:06:43] The word itself is God's word.
[3:06:48] And I say it is our privilege.
[3:06:52] Amen. I'm so glad. I am not just seated
[3:06:56] somewhere, you know, praying Hail Mary
[3:06:58] and counting, you know, certain beads.
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad, you know, I'm not bowing
[3:07:07] before an image somewhere.
[3:07:10] I am so glad. I'm a believer of the full
[3:07:13] word of God.
[3:07:15] You know, we used to sing a song. I'm so
[3:07:17] glad he brought me out.
[3:07:20] Amen. Where did he bring me from? In
[3:07:22] sin, he brought me out.
[3:07:25] Where did he bring me out of? He brought
[3:07:27] me out of marry.
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; He brought me out of denominationalism.
[3:07:33] You know, we talked about religion last
[3:07:35] time and how it is one of the greatest
[3:07:38] enemies
[3:07:43] and some people are trying to make
[3:07:44] religion even with this message.
[3:07:50] But this is beyond and organized
[3:07:52] religion.
[3:07:55] It is the life of Jesus Christ
[3:07:57] and it's a sacred and that sacred
[3:08:00] heritage is ours.
[3:08:03] God gave his word to his church
[3:08:06] and that sacred heritage is ours.
[3:08:12] It is a gift from God
[3:08:15] and we will not compromise on it
[3:08:19] and cut this out and throw this out and
[3:08:21] add this in.
[3:08:23] to suit our own twist.
[3:08:27] But we will preach the full word.
[3:08:30] Can I have here the preacher saying
[3:08:32] amen?
[3:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We will preach the full word, the
[3:08:38] whole gospel. We are duty bound as
[3:08:42] Christians to take it and believe it.
[3:08:48] You know the message teaches a lot of
[3:08:50] things.
[3:08:52] that the denominations don't believe in
[3:08:56] when I first came into this message. I
[3:08:58] had too many question
[3:09:01] you know why why are they saying this
[3:09:03] why this what about the others are they
[3:09:05] going to hell many questions but as I
[3:09:09] continue to study the word
[3:09:11] with the with the understanding of the
[3:09:13] message
[3:09:15] I understood
[3:09:18] it is something special
[3:09:21] that has been given only to a few
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; the minority
[3:09:29] One time Peter said to Jesus, "Why do
[3:09:32] you speak to these people in parables?"
[3:09:35] He said, "It is given to you
[3:09:40] to understand
[3:09:42] the mysteries of the kingdom."
[3:09:44] But to them is not given. Even today
[3:09:49] that those two groups are here.
[3:09:52] some who are not given to understand the
[3:09:53] mysteries of
[3:09:56] and to some who are given to understand
[3:09:59] when you talk about water baptism in the
[3:10:01] name of Jesus
[3:10:03] you will say amen but there are some
[3:10:06] people who will say no we don't
[3:10:09] understand it when you talk about one
[3:10:11] God and you say Jesus is God in flesh
[3:10:15] you will say amen but the denominations
[3:10:18] will say we are confused about
[3:10:22] We believe the trinity.
[3:10:24] When you say women are not supposed to
[3:10:25] be pastors,
[3:10:29] bishops and you know all these kind of
[3:10:31] things, they would say you you are you
[3:10:34] are you know trying to se segregate
[3:10:38] but to you it's not about segregation
[3:10:42] it's about the word. You know we are
[3:10:45] word believers, Bible believers.
[3:10:48] That's the message of Yahw message
[3:10:50] believers.
[3:10:53] The message is Christ.
[3:10:55] It's not a denomination.
[3:10:57] It is Christ. And that my friend is a
[3:11:01] sac trust.
[3:11:05] It has been given to us. We are supposed
[3:11:08] to protect it. We are the guardians
[3:11:12] of this mystery. We are the guardians of
[3:11:15] the message.
[3:11:17] Praise God. And if the devil thinks that
[3:11:19] the message is not right,
[3:11:23] Christ never died, never rose again, is
[3:11:24] not here, we are the proof.
[3:11:28] I am the proof. I preached to some young
[3:11:30] people and they said, pastor, it is very
[3:11:32] difficult to live a Christian life.
[3:11:37] And I said, well, there are some people
[3:11:38] who are living a Christian life.
[3:11:40] [Music]
[3:11:41] Said I'm one of them. That means you too
[3:11:44] can live a Christian life.
[3:11:46] You too can overcome this word. Why?
[3:11:49] Because we are given this word as a
[3:11:52] sacred trust.
[3:11:56] Praise God. Let us stand and sing that
[3:12:00] song.
[3:12:01] Give me that old time religion.
[3:12:06] &gt;&gt; I love that part which says it will take
[3:12:07] us all to heaven.
[3:12:12] It's a secret trust.
[3:12:22] Brother Shalom, you can come and help
[3:12:23] me. Praise God.
[3:12:35] How many love this oldtime religion?
[3:12:40] It's the old time Holy Spirit.

[3:12:46] reason people fear it.

[3:13:33] It's the old time Holy Spirit.
[3:13:36] The devil will not go near rain.
[3:13:40] That's the reason people fear me.
[3:13:42] &gt;&gt; But it's good enough for me.
[3:13:44] &gt;&gt; It's what Paul had. It's what Peter had.
[3:13:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[3:14:17] devil wants you.

[3:38:22] from a fast moving vehicle which came

[3:42:31] Turn to your neighbor. Tell them, "God
[3:42:33] bless you. Thank you for coming to the
[3:42:34] house of God.
[3:42:36] [Music]
[3:42:39] We are we are going to to ask the uh the
[3:42:42] team leaders to please remain shortly.
[3:42:44] We're just going to be maybe like
[3:42:46] maximum 20 minutes
[3:42:49] member leaders.
[3:42:52] The one for the land land fund. We have
[3:42:55] to those of you who do not did not know
[3:42:57] we have seven groups
[3:43:01] and we have seven members, seven
[3:43:03] brethren that lead each of one that
[3:43:05] leads each of those groups
[3:43:09] and every one year is expected to be in
[3:43:11] one of those
[3:43:15] where we collect little by little
[3:43:17] throughout the week.
[3:43:22] and uh on a Sunday on the Sunday what
[3:43:24] was announced is collected throughout
[3:43:25] the week.
[3:43:30] Brother, can I have that file? Brother,
[3:43:33] there's something I just want to mention
[3:43:34] before we go.
[3:43:49] I heard brother Joel reading. Thank you.
[3:43:52] Thank you, brother Joel. Hard him
[3:43:54] reading the report this morning.
[3:43:58] &gt;&gt; And um
[3:44:01] it's important for us to understand our
[3:44:04] goals
[3:44:09] and you know no one is going to buy this
[3:44:11] land for us.
[3:44:14] No one is going to build the church for
[3:44:16] us.
[3:44:18] But the Lord
[3:44:20] &gt;&gt; and the Lord is going to use the way God
[3:44:22] works is he blesses us to be able to do
[3:44:25] it.
[3:44:29] When we were starting this project,
[3:44:32] we had about 15 or 20 people who were
[3:44:35] contributing
[3:44:38] and in four years.
[3:44:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:44:57] Yeah. And you know that man that money
[3:45:00] was from our offerings.
[3:45:04] &gt;&gt; And
[3:45:06] I I would want to say we have come too
[3:45:08] far
[3:45:10] to look back.
[3:45:14] We are more than we were then.
[3:45:18] And uh the people who have been giving
[3:45:20] for all those four years
[3:45:24] for sure you can look back and see
[3:45:28] how also God has been faithful to you.
[3:45:32] So let's also be faithful.
[3:45:35] Um so much of this money that we are
[3:45:38] looking for now the difference is that
[3:45:40] much of this money is now pledged.
[3:45:46] I think we've pledged. Brother D, you
[3:45:48] know the total? A total of how how much?
[3:45:51] 10 and what?
[3:45:54] Who knows the total? Huh?
[3:45:58] But you give me an estimate like an
[3:46:00] estimate. I'm sure you must remember
[3:46:02] like an estimate. You have the laptop
[3:46:04] here. Yeah. Check and let us inform the
[3:46:07] people. Much of this money is really
[3:46:10] pledged about
[3:46:13] because we are looking for 20 million
[3:46:18] which is the the the
[3:46:21] last phase of the purchase of this land.
[3:46:27] But the way we are paying this
[3:46:30] is in phases.
[3:46:32] I think it's about four phases.
[3:46:35] So the second phase has four phases
[3:46:40] and each phase
[3:46:43] we are expected to pay 30 millions.
[3:46:47] We are given an allowance of 12 months
[3:46:52] and that was a miracle.
[3:46:55] So and the the the the
[3:47:00] 12 months were divided into three
[3:47:03] months.
[3:47:06] four times.
[3:47:08] Three months, three months, three
[3:47:10] months, three months.
[3:47:11] So each three months
[3:47:14] we are supposed to pay 30 million.
[3:47:17] That's what we are supposed to pay.
[3:47:20] So the this first section of three
[3:47:23] months
[3:47:25] is ending um
[3:47:29] I think after next Sunday.
[3:47:35] So we have two week weeks
[3:47:39] to pay 30 millions.
[3:47:42] So so far
[3:47:45] in 10 weeks
[3:47:47] we've collected 13.6 millions
[3:47:53] and I heard the brother telling you how
[3:47:55] much more you need to gather.
[3:48:00] What the purpose for this report is for
[3:48:02] you to get the big picture
[3:48:08] so that you do not be oblivious to these
[3:48:11] things.
[3:48:15] We are remaining with 16.4 million
[3:48:17] people.
[3:48:20] So we we are remaining with more than
[3:48:22] what we what we
[3:48:25] [Music]
[3:48:29] would have done it
[3:48:31] &gt;&gt; already by now even in seven weeks
[3:48:35] if each of us would have been like every
[3:48:38] one of us
[3:48:43] not in the amount we are giving
[3:48:46] but in the commitment
[3:48:49] I had the treasurer Let's say
[3:48:53] some of you have jobs
[3:48:56] meaning you have income as however small
[3:48:58] it might be.
[3:49:01] So surely within a week you cannot fail
[3:49:04] to give something.
[3:49:09] Now there are some people who don't have
[3:49:11] jobs
[3:49:14] and they want to do something.
[3:49:18] I'll tell you what they have been doing.
[3:49:20] They've been calling on their friends
[3:49:24] who have jobs, may not be from this
[3:49:27] church, may not even be believers.
[3:49:31] We just tell them we are trying to do
[3:49:32] fundraising at our church
[3:49:36] and we need support.
[3:49:38] Never be ashamed to ask for the Lord.
[3:49:43] Me, I'm always shy to ask for my
[3:49:45] personal needs.
[3:49:48] I've never told you here publicly of any
[3:49:50] personal need.
[3:49:54] But when it comes to the for the work of
[3:49:56] God,
[3:49:57] I'm never ashamed.
[3:49:59] So, and some believers here,
[3:50:03] have been talking to their friends
[3:50:06] and their friends have been helping.
[3:50:11] I'll give you an example. Where is the
[3:50:14] team leader for William Brham?
[3:50:18] Is she in?
[3:50:23] She's out.
[3:50:29] Can the deacons help me?
[3:50:32] I wanted to give you that little example
[3:50:33] there.
[3:50:34] [Music]
[3:50:38] And you find that many of these people
[3:50:40] giving a lot of money here
[3:50:44] don't even earn much.
[3:50:47] or don't even have anything
[3:50:49] but they are bringing their friends to
[3:50:51] help them.
[3:50:54] Now I'm seeing Colomba
[3:50:57] giving a lot of money
[3:51:02] and used to be one of the groups which
[3:51:05] were down
[3:51:07] giving 65
[3:51:10] but you see the efforts that they have
[3:51:11] put in there. It shows that the team
[3:51:14] leader is really committed
[3:51:17] and the people are committed within that
[3:51:20] group. And if you ask
[3:51:23] I I did not get the report for Ka so
[3:51:25] that's why I do not know but if you ask
[3:51:27] you find that there are other they are
[3:51:29] collecting other people and they
[3:51:31] supporting them.
[3:51:35] [Music]
[3:51:37] It's a revelation brethren.
[3:51:42] Then lastly,
[3:51:45] the other thing that is helping the
[3:51:46] groups that are making more money every
[3:51:49] week
[3:51:53] is those who pledged
[3:51:55] are faithfully paying their pledge.
[3:52:01] You see we have pledged 113 million
[3:52:06] [Music]
[3:52:11] but only 13 is only 13 point something
[3:52:14] is paid.
[3:52:16] So we remaining with more than 100
[3:52:18] pledged.
[3:52:22] So what does this mean? There are many
[3:52:26] brethren you see now for example John
[3:52:28] Wizzley
[3:52:31] &gt;&gt; John Wasley contributed 41,000
[3:52:36] &gt;&gt; which I believe this was a big effort by
[3:52:38] a few
[3:52:43] if you ask the team leader
[3:52:45] who's the team leader for
[3:52:50] is she
[3:52:51] February,
[3:52:54] &gt;&gt; where are these team leaders?
[3:52:57] &gt;&gt; Can the deacons please ask them to come
[3:52:59] in?
[3:53:03] Okay, then I have Paul. Who is the team
[3:53:05] leader for Paul?
[3:53:07] Okay, you gave 65,000.
[3:53:10] How many contributed in your group?
[3:53:14] Five. How many do you have in your
[3:53:17] group?
[3:53:21] 15. So you can see only five out of 15.
[3:53:25] So which means the 10
[3:53:28] they are not committed.
[3:53:32] What is commitment?
[3:53:34] Commitment is not paying million,000
[3:53:39] giving something
[3:53:42] however little it is.
