[13:04] we come to you with praise

[13:26] a body like this place
[13:29] [Music]
[13:39] [Music]
[13:40] we have gathered to Feast with the King

[13:45] with the Lord of lords this morning
[13:49] our desire is to you
[13:53] Lord we've even had our sister Esther
[13:55] who has not been able to be here
[13:59] because she's sick
[14:02] father Lord even as she's here foreign
[14:22] [Music]
[14:48] amen
[14:50] amen
[14:52] amen before you get seated please open
[14:54] your Bibles with me
[14:58] let us go to the book of Hebrews chapter
[15:01] 11.
[15:08] Hebrews chapter 11
[15:14] and um
[15:16] we are really just reading one verse
[15:18] together
[15:31] are you are you there yet
[15:36] if you're there just say Amen what does
[15:38] all right so we read together verse six
[15:44] we can begin from verse 5.
[15:48] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[15:51] should not see death and was not found
[15:54] because God had translated him
[15:57] for before his translation he had this
[16:00] testimony that he pleased God
[16:03] is a
[16:40] which we shall really dwell on but for
[16:43] now let us ask God to bless his one and
[16:45] then you'll be seated father we commit
[16:47] this word into your hands that we have
[16:48] read
[16:50] these people into your hands as well
[16:54] give me the grace Lord to speak to them
[16:57] that the word will penetrate their
[16:59] hearts
[17:02] direct my thoughts
[17:05] and everything Lord and give us a good
[17:09] atmosphere
[17:10] that your holy spirit will be pleased
[17:12] with us this morning
[17:14] Father we ask this blessing in Jesus
[17:17] name
[17:22] praise the Lord now I'd like to bring
[17:25] greetings to you in the name of Jesus
[17:27] Christ this morning
[17:30] when you greet your neighbor and tell
[17:32] them God bless you
[17:35] so uh this morning
[17:38] um I'm happy that you prayed for me and
[17:40] I'm back safely
[17:45] the ones who prayed for me I want to say
[17:47] God bless you
[17:50] God answered your prayers that I'm back
[17:52] when I'm well
[17:55] amen and not only that but also God gave
[17:58] us wonderful a wonderful time in Germany
[18:02] Germany we really had a uh it was a
[18:06] supernatural weekend for me
[18:10] you know in the meetings there we had a
[18:13] lot of Believers and ministers and
[18:15] people coming in from different
[18:16] countries
[18:22] the meetings were hosted by the pastor
[18:25] in Germany brother God Road
[18:30] who has been in the message for quite
[18:34] very many years maybe almost 50 now um
[18:39] and so uh we had the ministers and
[18:42] Saints from Belgium
[18:46] from Italy England Germany Russia Poland
[18:50] Ukraine Ukraine notice you were in a
[18:53] meeting
[18:54] in one in one of the services we had a
[18:57] prayer line
[18:59] and one of the pastors that was with us
[19:03] on the prayer line um
[19:05] was a pastor Sagi from Russia
[19:11] Moscow and
[19:13] some believers who are coming to be
[19:15] prayed for we are from Ukraine
[19:19] and you know in Ukraine and Russia they
[19:21] speak the same language
[19:23] and so these people could not be able to
[19:25] express themselves in in Germany or in
[19:28] English
[19:31] had to interpret for brother Timothy and
[19:35] the rest of us uh
[19:38] um for these people from Russian or
[19:41] stroke Ukrainian to to to English
[19:52] those of us who know what is happening
[19:54] in Russia and Ukraine you're like that
[19:55] is impossible
[20:00] but that's confirmed to me
[20:03] in the believer's world
[20:05] we are completely in another world
[20:09] we are living in the world truly but we
[20:12] are not of the world no matter what is
[20:15] going on in the politics of the regions
[20:17] or the politics of the world
[20:20] the believer is not really that much
[20:22] affected
[20:24] because what affects us is what is in
[20:28] our world
[20:31] and I'm glad to be a part of this world
[20:35] where there was war in Ukraine
[20:48] praying for ukrainians that have been
[20:50] maybe lost their families or lost things
[20:52] or lost and he's praying for them and
[20:54] comforting them in the Lord
[21:01] that means that we are citizens of
[21:03] another country
[21:17] we had most of the services uh uh on the
[21:21] weekend preached by the team and brother
[21:23] Timothy orange
[21:28] and brother God asked me to preach the
[21:31] first service on I think it was on a
[21:33] Friday
[21:39] we agree that it will be the appetizer
[21:42] for the services
[21:45] but I was really humbled I mean there
[21:48] were many many ministers who would have
[21:49] stood chance
[21:53] God gave us Grace I know that some of
[21:55] you streamed that service
[21:59] and those who did not get a chance
[22:01] because you know in Germany they are not
[22:03] like in the U.S or other uh capitalist
[22:06] countries
[22:12] have kind of a way that they do their
[22:15] own things
[22:17] are not difficult for some of you to
[22:19] even access the service because it was
[22:21] you have to sign in on our website to
[22:24] access it
[22:28] I requested brother God I said brother
[22:31] God would it be okay for me to stream uh
[22:33] the weekend of these meetings on our
[22:35] Channel on YouTube kids
[22:38] foreign
[22:46] is when
[22:50] sorry
[22:52] 9 pm today
[23:01] basically I was giving my testimony and
[23:03] gave a little exportation
[23:06] and then uh the rest of the meetings
[23:09] will also follow I think we'll announce
[23:11] to you when or you just keep checking on
[23:13] the channel it will be uploaded there
[23:15] and then you can be able to stream it
[23:16] and share it with others it was a
[23:18] blessing
[23:23] and so I also had a wonderful time you
[23:26] know brother Tim brother Tim fruit
[23:28] is a man that has preached this message
[23:31] for more than 50 years
[23:36] and if I've seen
[24:01] invited him in one of his meetings in
[24:04] Canada
[24:12] [Music]
[24:23] speaking of about the ministry and you
[24:26] know like I I can say that he was
[24:28] imparting on me all the years of his
[24:31] ministry and I really felt it was a big
[24:33] blessing for me
[24:43] brothers from here in Uganda and
[24:46] basically in Africa that go
[24:48] to Europe or to America to to receive a
[24:51] money impartation
[24:58] and I was really very embarrassed
[25:02] as they were telling me of some of these
[25:04] names of people
[25:07] from here
[25:09] keep writing letters
[25:15] what I told these brothers I said look
[25:17] Brothers
[25:20] because I understand that this came in
[25:23] from a long history
[25:32] Uganda and I really need to tell you
[25:34] this is
[25:38] but he failed to come because of War now
[25:42] and at the time you know Uganda was kind
[25:45] of uh broken into many pieces
[25:49] people did not have clothes
[25:52] people did not have food they didn't
[25:55] even have time to cultivate them
[25:58] and so they wouldn't have education
[26:04] we were broken down because of you know
[26:07] it was like a war-ton country in
[26:09] Colorado
[26:11] some of the brothers that came here
[26:13] those many years ago
[26:17] and so all they could do was to support
[26:19] give money support give money for
[26:21] everything
[26:26] you know they have to come and preach
[26:28] meetings they have to rent a building
[26:30] like this so they have to pay because
[26:36] food for preachers
[26:41] you see what I believe with all my heart
[26:44] that we have moved from them
[26:50] we might not have attained what they
[26:53] have attained
[26:55] but we are no longer where Uganda was 30
[26:58] 40 years ago
[27:02] I spoke to the Brethren and I told them
[27:06] this is another generation
[27:09] we are in another generation
[27:11] and I told them I mean like I never have
[27:14] known brother God for very many years
[27:17] and they say to him I mean like I've
[27:20] never written you to ask for any money
[27:23] but I had needs everybody has needs
[27:27] whether they are white or black but we
[27:30] need to have a realization
[27:32] that the god of the whites
[27:37] The God Who bless them
[27:46] and so I clearly put it to the Brethren
[27:49] together and I told them if there is
[27:52] anything I've come for here
[27:54] once you invited me
[27:56] do I desire to come
[27:59] because but the temple was going to be
[28:01] in this meeting
[28:05] because I was really immensely blessed
[28:08] and we had a good a real good time in
[28:11] discussing about the ministry and about
[28:13] you know the work of the Lord and his
[28:15] experience over there
[28:27] several friends some of which are are
[28:30] going to come and visit us
[28:38] I said if you came to Uganda you will be
[28:42] the first preacher from Russia to come
[28:43] to him
[28:47] how many would like to see him
[28:52] the message
[28:55] oh my I'm telling you you would say well
[28:57] this message is from American is a
[28:59] Russian and a Russian America you know
[29:01] oh how come let me tell you this message
[29:03] is not American message
[29:07] this message is from the mind of God
[29:11] and so there's a lot that we can talk
[29:13] about the trip but I think I'll not take
[29:15] more time I want us to just go right
[29:16] into the world
[29:19] but I want to appreciate the ministers
[29:21] Brother Martin brother luang Gabba the
[29:24] Joel and the other musicians and the
[29:26] brothers that have really students
[29:35] I've heard that you've had wonderful
[29:37] meetings
[29:43] [Music]
[29:48] so this morning I just want to continue
[29:50] you remember
[29:51] time I left
[29:53] on the power
[29:54] part 2.
[29:59] so I ended up speaking on on it but I
[30:02] did not go into the what I wanted to go
[30:04] into so I'll this is like part three but
[30:06] it will really be the second part of
[30:08] that service
[30:15] so please go back to the Village Hebrews
[30:18] 11
[30:19] movies
[30:28] [Music]
[30:30] now Faith is the substance of things
[30:32] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[30:34] Seen
[30:40] for by it the elders obtained a good
[30:43] report
[30:46] through faith we understand that the
[30:49] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[30:53] that things which are seen were not made
[30:55] of things which do appear
[30:58] s
[31:05] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[31:08] excellent sacrifice than that of Cain
[31:11] is
[31:15] by which you obtained witness that he
[31:18] was righteous God testifying of his
[31:21] gifts and by it he being dead yet
[31:37] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[31:39] should not see death
[32:27] and he continued stressing the point it
[32:30] was by Faith
[32:34] by faith
[32:39] in the land
[32:52] can you imagine an offering David is a
[32:55] natural way why you cannot give to God
[32:57] an offering and God accepts it if it is
[33:00] not by faith
[33:05] it must be by faith
[33:11] if it is
[33:13] God can never accept your sacrifice
[33:20] well if you're hearing me you better say
[33:22] Amen
[33:23] praise the name of the Lord so
[33:26] everything
[33:27] that we do as a Believers
[33:30] must be by faith
[33:35] it is impossible to please
[33:39] every one of us let us read verses six
[33:42] together
[33:44] one two three go but without faith but
[33:49] without faith
[33:54] let us do it again maybe you are not
[33:55] there yet let us do it again
[33:57] now
[35:23] puts it all under one umbrella we're
[35:27] gonna play them you'll never take our
[35:28] one so I'm talking when he said what is
[35:31] faith
[35:32] in the message the anointed ones at the
[35:34] end time
[35:36] faith is something that is revealed to
[35:39] you
[35:43] five is something that is revealed to
[35:45] you
[35:47] praise the name of the Lord come here
[35:49] let me tell you
[35:50] something can be open
[35:53] that should be good but we're not
[35:55] revealed
[35:57] when the sales were removed
[36:01] and the book is an open book
[36:05] the book is full of promises
[36:09] full of you know what God has promised
[36:12] his children
[36:15] the book is showing us what we are going
[36:17] to be together the book is demonstrating
[36:21] what a child of God must be
[36:25] now everything in that open books
[36:31] because God has said it is
[36:42] not good to you foreign
[37:09] [Music]
[38:44] people when some something is revealed
[38:46] to you
[38:47] could be people will try to talk you out
[38:50] of it
[38:51] I will try to make you as a fail as if
[38:54] you were a failure
[38:56] oh but because you have faith because
[39:03] you see what they don't see
[39:06] because you know what they don't know
[39:10] is revealed to you
[39:14] praise the name of the Lord faith is a
[39:17] revelation from God
[39:20] faith is a revelation
[39:24] tell your neighbor faith is a revelation
[39:36] of you tell somebody come on
[39:47] it is a revelation he has revealed it to
[39:52] you
[39:53] by his grace it is
[40:04] given to you by the grace of God
[40:10] hallelujah amen and God reveals it to
[40:13] you
[40:14] therefore faith is a revelation
[40:18] and the whole Church of God is built
[40:21] upon them
[40:24] and how does faith
[40:27] Hallelujah man how does faith come oh
[40:36] foreign
[41:55] it is time for it to happen
[41:59] amen hallelujah amen hallelujah yes sir
[42:03] the moment something is
[42:11] it is
[42:21] one of the examples
[42:25] um I will read from the message out from
[42:27] the message uh wax is no no no just a
[42:30] moment
[42:31] I'll get the message I want to read from
[42:34] uh wax is Faith expressed yes
[42:45] I wanted to listen to these words
[42:49] man I mean and as I'm preaching to you
[42:52] maybe some of you will surface
[42:57] that moment when you receive it
[43:00] say Amen because that moment something
[43:05] is
[43:06] before I talk about Davis
[43:18] from where he came from to come in
[43:21] Israel and when he arrived there the
[43:24] reason why he came was because he had
[43:27] there was a prophet of God in Israel
[43:30] the reason why you have come it's
[43:33] because
[43:38] you know in this place is
[43:41] sent out to you
[43:44] when you hear that message without faith
[43:48] they know nothing will happen to you
[43:49] foreign
[44:49] Ghana
[45:33] foreign
[46:14] I need let me let me tell you the gospel
[46:16] engineering is not only one she became
[46:19] of your car the gospel words
[46:23] and life
[46:25] praise the name of the Lord Jesus did
[46:28] not just preach yes Jesus but he also
[46:32] opened the eyes of the blind
[46:34] he also made the lamb to work so the
[46:39] gospel Angel is not only what she became
[46:41] of your car we are not to be educated
[46:43] people
[46:44] we are not to be educated only
[46:47] if we are only educated message
[46:49] Believers
[46:52] we have the mechanics but we have no
[46:54] Dynamics
[46:57] which we are preaching to you
[47:02] Spirit your yard is alive it can create
[47:08] some return the life in the middle
[47:14] foreign
[48:00] you can choose to go back to Urban and
[48:02] fever
[48:06] or go and die with your Liberation
[48:09] or do what I said God doesn't change his
[48:12] words
[48:14] to suit our desires
[48:20] stop if you want to go to work
[48:23] do what he's watching his word is not
[48:27] debatable
[48:29] difference between the message believers
[48:31] denominations
[48:44] now here comes a man who begins to
[48:47] debate with the prophet
[48:49] and the prophet said what I say change
[48:52] is
[48:57] it wasn't even written
[49:01] sometimes you can come in the chance
[49:04] and a preacher speak to you direct um
[49:12] he's just excited
[49:14] nothing will happen
[49:16] nothing will happen
[49:19] if you receive a resolution
[49:24] and then maybe he speaks to you and the
[49:27] ministers do you in your heart

[51:33] Revelations
[51:35] seize that moment
[51:39] Naman was hesitant yes and he was just
[51:42] delaying his miracles
[51:46] but the moment that little girl came

[51:56] by inspiration she came to him and she

[1:04:33] foreign
[1:05:55] and singing songs

[1:07:10] revelation

[1:08:44] we have people who have a lot of Ahmed a
[1:08:47] lot of wealth

[1:08:52] but they still have it married
[1:08:55] they're just moving around from woman to
[1:08:57] woman
[1:09:00] with some women
[1:09:05] just getting married and sticking with
[1:09:08] one woman and paying you know bright
[1:09:10] price and doing a wedding oh it's like
[1:09:15] okay
[1:09:21] it is a Dreadful thing for them because
[1:09:25] you see they have no Revelation how can
[1:09:28] they receive Revelations
[1:09:40] because it means we are not hearing
[1:09:43] questions
[1:09:48] the Bible says casting down imagination
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:52] I've seen people

[1:11:18] in churches around me in the message
[1:11:23] that inclusive
[1:11:28] why do many people suffer financially
[1:11:44] and they told me something
[1:11:46] that I said that is right
[1:11:49] he said in his church
[1:11:52] he has had a lot of people sometimes
[1:11:54] they are they're suffering financially
[1:12:01] and they would come to him and say
[1:12:02] Pastor um
[1:12:28] foreign
[1:13:25] foreign
[1:13:52] foreign
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:32] I found the pastor there
[1:14:37] he is I know I'm here from here I know
[1:14:41] he said millions
[1:14:50] but the house he lives
[1:14:52] it was built I think it is as old as the
[1:14:55] USA
[1:15:00] foreign
[1:15:15] foreign
[1:16:01] specifically what I saw was from Malawi
[1:16:03] you know houses which are about to fall

[1:18:23] [Music]
[1:19:08] he will bless
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] I think we as the days of the voice
[1:19:58] Fellowship can be an example if we
[1:20:00] choose to be days
[1:20:18] it's never too late for God to fulfill
[1:20:21] his word
[1:20:21] [Applause]
[1:20:24] let me let me let me give you another
[1:20:26] example
[1:20:29] out one day of God in a prayer and here
[1:20:33] come a thousand citizens upon him
[1:20:39] and he looked down on the ground and
[1:20:41] there is where a mule had died
[1:20:49] dry as it could be
[1:20:53] and they took it and it and took out
[1:20:56] after those Philistines
[1:21:06] not the truth
[1:21:08] foreign
[1:21:50] foreign
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:34] but what did he have yeah
[1:22:39] and that Revelation
[1:22:41] amen Drew him
[1:22:44] Moses
[1:23:44] foreign
[1:24:24] there were many tacos in the camp why do
[1:24:27] everyone because of one man with
[1:24:29] Revelations
[1:24:33] imagine if you're fighting on a
[1:24:35] battlefronto he's killing on the front
[1:24:38] in the back on the side and on the left
[1:24:42] he's killing everywhere
[1:24:46] it must have been some exercise for him
[1:24:50] but it wasn't his strength it was the
[1:24:53] power of Revelation
[1:24:54] what do we have let me tell you when you
[1:24:59] receive revelation God begins to work
[1:25:02] with you
[1:25:04] using whatever you are crazy it might be
[1:25:08] small
[1:25:09] that's what you need to begin Hallelujah

[1:26:32] you want them to to go in a place where
[1:26:34] it's not like a sanctuary
[1:26:42] I think parents who are here you'd
[1:26:45] rather do all you because of your
[1:26:47] confidence
[1:26:51] and say I'm going to kill this
[1:26:54] Philistines
[1:26:57] right now let me kill him not only for

[1:27:12] can have our own topics
[1:27:23] and
[1:27:26] not even the job

[1:31:18] because it was God is
[1:31:23] still to me for me at that moment
