like to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen uh has the Lord been good to you ask your neighbor has the Lord been good to you just turn around and greet your neighb God bless you amen I'm happy to see those who have made it to church tonight you can see I'm not dressed like a preacher tonight so I'm not preing so sometimes you know uh when I come for a prayer meeting I want to be comfortable and move around and push push means pray until something happens praise the name of the Lord I'm so happy tonight we have a brother who the Lord has um permitted that he would speak to us tonight uh maybe some of you know him others perhaps do not know him brother Julius J is um he's from I think he's not been in the message for so long maybe brother Julius you will tell us a little bit of how long you've been in the message uh but I love I've loved him for his uh love for the message and his Zeal um you know when if you see that if there is someone who will amount to anything in Ministry you will you will see them by the Zeal they have the fire they have when they starting out um you know I remember I still have this the the same Zeal and fire but there are certain things I used to do then that I may not be able to do now 18 years ago I I was I was wondering how I was you know able to one day I traveled by road to Zimbabwe I was almost killed inam there was an incident there the enemy had planned things for me but you see you I travel the whole week in a bus and then hit the road preaching and preach for a month plus go to Nair preach on the streets you know I was just traveling preaching traveling preaching baptizing traveling preaching Bap you know when God is just initiating you into the ministry that Zeal does a lot and that's why we want all our young people to be on fire but when you see someone who is starting out and and just you know like you need to push them there is a problem there usually but brother Julius has a Zeal and I've not heard him preach before but uh you can tell by talking to him that he's a real Christian amen I I think I'll just leave it at that and maybe speak more afterwards praise the Lord but even on Sunday there's there's more testimonies that uh we will share about what the Lord is doing in uh brother sh just gave me the news and I'm just so amazed God is still moving God is still doing miracles God is still calling his SE and there's a Revival now let me tell you that this message it is it moves by itself it's not an organization that pushes it it has power H how can I say there is Revival power behind the message when it is in City or in a country no man can put it out amen and no man can start it because it's only God who does start it and no one can put it out and so I believe there is more that God has amen for so I'd like um us to stand and to receive our brother Julius as uh he will be coming to minister tonight so brother Julius have your Liberty full Liberty preach like brother Julius preach your heart and let the Holy Spirit move so overnight you have up to two three hours to preach is that all right amen and then the left over time will be able to go in pray praise the Lord I understand there's another young person that came from ah God bless you please let us receive him godess this young man goes to work with him and uh is trying to reach out the message and he said I will take you to my pastor today and um so uh probably after the preaching or before the morning we shall spend time with him I try to um give him the the message as we know it amen so brother you are welcome what is his name brother John you're welcome feel at home this is called days of the voice fell of the voice we have no book but the Bible we have no membership but we have Fellowship we have no law but we have love we have no Creed but we have Christ amen and we believe the blood of Jesus washes us from all sin amen praise the Lord so I'll not eat up more time for the preacher I just let him come wonderful wonderful Jesus is to me celor Prince of Peace Mighty God is he oh saving me oh from all sin and shame wonderful wonderful Jesus is to me PR of Peace Mighty God is he saving me and keeping me for all sin and shame wonderful is my redeemer praise yes say is wonderful wonderful Jesus is to me PR of Peace Mighty God is he he's saving me and keeping me from all sin and shame is my redeemer praise [Applause] is amen wonderful is my redeemer praise His holy name God bless you so much uh you first take your seats for some minutes since past started something here and he asked me to tell you something about it I'm glad to be here with you today this is my third time to be in this church here and uh it is not my last time to be here yes my name is Julius I'm a Christian like you I believe this message with all my heart and I came to it I came to know about it in 2020 when I had just come out I came from angrim I've ever been in years I was there but in The Villages there shes those shrines like that then around 2019 I I I chose I made a decision when I was reading the Bible John 8 something stried my heart I said I want to be baptized the way Jesus was baptized I asked a friend of mine he was a Pentecostal was a preacher I told him can you baptize me now now he said he laughed he said tomorrow I said all right I'm wai he took me baptized me I rejoiced glory to God but by and by still struggling to overcome the things I'm TI of a young man brought to me the book revelation of the seven Christ appears on the Sunset and the Seven Church ages I started with the Revelation 76 and I was reading through God revealed in I said this these are good things started to pick my phone and Sh people think um but I was copy women preachers I said these things I read in the Bible and I asked my friend who was a Pentecost why are they like this in the Bible but they are not so in the church me know was just you know you know the Corinthians women were shouting I said okay I've just believed I don't know too much this is one who knows too much when I found them in that book I asked Brian is to Sister phib where are the people believe this he was not giving much Z and said I went to they believe a certain man but when I read I said they don't believe him where are these people buy and buy could not tell me it's later when brother brother to sister Ted so you can win a s on your phone you can do it it was me myself he was using a b phone he's using Bon phone to send messages to people some of you should be receiving those maybe I don't despise them they led me to Christ so he talked to me about baptism said I've read the book of Acts from cover to cover but I didn't see this I said I've never even heard about it so he directed me to church I went there I want to be baptized I was baptized from there on uh something was always burning in my heart I want to tell someone wherever I go I I asked an elder that something is pushing me I said let it goas it I went on the street I released it and it brought results as Pastor said how you moved on the road to Zim I could walk distances to preach caring about nothing until this day and now I'm standing here with [Applause] you so God richly bless you as we continue we shall get to know each other and bu buy and buy I ask for undivided attention uh since it is my first time here gets a little nervous but God gives the grace yes amen God Rich bless you so much we shall we shall know each other more is a night let save some of the time yes as brother B has told you our pastor here I've so many times they call you brother bus yes told you he loved me he didn't just say that he showed me that he loves me yes he has always showed it to me and he really loves me he's a blessing to me bless you amen God bless you Pastor thank you so much for this opportunity let us stand up and we sing this song I want to sing this song before I read the scripture and unspoken request does anybody have one here tonight did you come with a burden you you can share need in your life just lift up your hand to the one who can give you rest child of no fear Our God can hear an unspoken liid if you have any unspoken request child of God have no fear Our God can hear unspoken request dear heavenly gracious father come and add a blessing to your words come and divide it to your people come and speak to them I am insufficient I am weak but Thou Art strong come and take over the service to lead the people toher them into prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen let us go to Exodus chapter 10 verse 8 to 11 Exodus 10 verse 8 to 11 it is a half 11 I want to use not more than one and a half hours not more than that and Moses and Aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the Lord your God but who are they that shall go Exodus 10 verse 8 to1 amen 8 to 11 I finish it all yeah you can finish it okay and Moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our hearts we will go amen for we must hold a feast unto the Lord hallelujah and he said unto them let the Lord be so with you as I will let you go and your little ones look to itat for evil is before you not so go now ye that are man and serve the Lord for that ye did desire and they were driven out from Pharaoh's [Music] presence [Music] fore amen amen may God add a blessing to reading of his take your seats enjoy your seats as are seated I want to read also verse 24 to 26 the chapter the Bible says and Pharaoh called unto Moses and said go ye serve the Lord only let your flocks and your hearts be stayed let your little ones also go with you and Moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and birth offerings Hallelujah that we may sacrifice unto the Lord Our God Amen our C also shall go with us there shall not any who be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the Lord Our God and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we come either amen fore amen my subject tonight is taking all that belongs to us taking all that belongs to us it was Moses that God had called to go and deliver the of Israel out of captivity and from bondage in the which they had been [Music] taken by by in Egypt there and when the time of the promise to bring them out at come God sends Moses and he says I will deliver them out but with a might hand I'm going to deliver them but the Deliverance by the which I will deliver them shall be with a mighty and Moses went down there and the first miracle was the that he threw down the road that he and he turned into a snake and The Magicians of pharaoh their enchantments did the same thing but God the other Serpent of Moses SED up the others of The Magicians but The Magicians also did made the snakes with their enchantments imitators of God and Pharaoh's heart was hardened he could not let them go well God did another miracle he said all right he sent flocks it was blood turn all the water into blood The Magicians with their enchantments did the same thing was it making things better it was making things worse imitation makes things worse and Pharaoh's heart was hardened not let them go and God said I do another miracle FRS came all over Egypt filled the entire country The Magicians did the same thing with their enchantments and Pharaoh's heart was hardened God did another miracle Li came out of the Dust The Magicians with their enchantments this time it failed brother sister imitation has a limit it has a limitation the enchantments of the devil the liation they can imitate the truth they can imitate the servant of God they can imitate the Miracles but there is a limit their imitation and that is the Vindication of the true s that was the end of the enchantments of The Magicians the rest of the Miracles that were happening they had no power when the bo came all over Egypt they were attacked also they were also in trouble and now after Pharaoh had seen all these Miracles still he could not let the children of Israel go at first my subject is taking all that belongs to us at first he says all right the flogs are too many the is too many you go and do sacrifice to your God go and ser go and do sacrifice and Moses said we are not going to do sacrifice we are in Egypt go days journey why we cannot offer that which is an Abomination to the Egyptians they will rest us oh brother the Bible says inis every Shepherd is an Abomination to the Egyptians now these Shepherds of isra they are going to do sacrifices to God using sheep some animal which are Abominations to the Egyptians so Moses says we are not going to serve God and sacrifice to him in the land of bondage we cannot sacrifice to God yet we cannot sacrifice to God the place where people are going to look at us and persecute us and St us and us away we must when we shall shout hallelujah scream a little bit they will say leave my rental you been a good tenant you been a good tenant but you bring your shout and shout please leave my house for that case I need my own I need my own why why because they will Stone us when they hear us sacrifices to God the sacrifice that we offer tonight is the fruit of our lips to the Lord Our God so he wants them to take a part of it he wants them to take a part of it if you want to offer sacrifice God is a terrible God all right offer it here Ines says no sir no sir we are not going he refused he refused the B and phara goes onther and when more the Miracles were done now says all right all right okay okay I'll leave you you go okay you you said okay you can't over here you want to go but who are those ones going yes yes among you that are children of God who are those that are going and Moses brought the list I have the list here we will go the men our wives our children and our let the men think this is good men let these men for let them be free let them receive the Holy Ghost let them go the prayer meeting let this man go and serve God go go with the men these children let them remain let it they CLE and Moses said I'm not taking the we are taking all that belongs to us it says we are going me the men the wives the children and our flock because why we have to take the flock is because out of this flock we are going to why you want us to go poor what shall we use to Oh Brother you can be saved your wife your wife why my wife should be there your wife but the children children are my children to all right all right you be a Christian be a Christian a poor Christian said no a poor Christian be complain [Applause] sacrifice not even un not even un are taking all it belongs to us because it is our [Applause] all that was in belonged to them they came with them when Jacob came and his sons it was not for Egyptian it is for them it was for them and Moses said I refuse the bade brother sister you have to be just bald and strong and reject and refuse and deny willfully knowing the promise of God and tell the devil Satan I have heard but all that belongs to me I'm taking it listen brother and pharaoh said oh I I don't know I can't accept that I can't accept that whether you accept not we are taking all that belongs to us and the Miracles went on further when the heart was hardened in Exodus 12 verse 29 Bible says it came to pass that at midnight the Lord sm all the first born in the land of Egypt from the first Bor of pharaoh that sat on his throne the first born of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the first born brother go was determined to let them go out be set free with all that and Pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his ser and all the Egyptians and there was a great cry a great money Noto but in Egypt among the Egyptians for there was no the house where where there was not one dead and he called for Moses and by night he came in he refused the peaceful and God WR it in a hard way and he said at night Rise Up Get You forth from among my leave go now this time this time this time you and the children of and go and serve the Lord as you have Hallelujah you must resist the burgain of the and he remembered that oh not only that also take your flocks your heart as you have said I like that as you have said Hallelujah and be gone and bless me also will ask for your blessing because they will know that the god you ser is the Living God hallelujah yes sir and the Bible says the Egyptians were urgent were urgent upon the people they might send them out of the land in quickly for they said all dead men and the people took their D before it was they are needing TRS being bound up in their cloes on their shoulders and they continued on brother sister they could not accept to go empty they could not accept to go without their children sir we are taking all that belongs to us now that was in the days of Moses but he that was Moses he that was with the church in the wilderness says is the same that is with the church today and so Peter says in second Petter 1 verse 3 to 4 he says like this second Peter chapter 1 3 to 4 according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virt by are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this you might be partakers of the divine nature kept the corruption that is in the world through l i want you to listen attentively brother Peter saying that as his divine power he has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and God things that to this life andl I'm Godly I'm God reject the physical he has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness to life godl both sides I believe I believe strongly believe that this message is a balanced message it is a balanced message it didn't come to restore only the spiritual side if you can prosper in the spirit prosper in the physic he is the same God all these things all that Christ died for and every blessing of abrah is yours you are the Seed of Abraham the Bible says Isaiah 61 when Christ came the spirit of God is upon me because he has anointed and the spirit of God is upon the church because he has anointed the church to set the captives free to preach the gospel the and to bind up the broken hearted are you emotionally troubled are you broken the Troubles of the youth breaks emotions anxiety and despair Jesus came bind up the Broken Heart the promise of God that you ought to take to yourself healing is the promise of God to the children of God as the brother said and he testified and Isaiah I have it to here praise to God a witness of I have it to here the hand of God is against Satan and all your enemies it was against Pharaoh it was against Egypt because all the Egyptians persed the children of God the hand of God against them so the devil if he wants to fight if he wants to fight and defeat you he has to first defeat if he can defeat God he can defeat if he can't defeat God can't defeat yes sir I am Anchored In Jesus brothers and sisters what we need is a total deliver not halfway under the blood of bulls and gods Moses said I'm not taking a halfway deliver and under the blood of Jesus you want to take brother as long as God gives me a job even if I don't have the Holy Ghost you it can't be that's not the message that God brother I have the Holy Ghost things don't [Music] matter you don't know the Holy Ghost is the ho ghost why should you make him so poor like you know if I can just be preaching if you not winning s why are you satisfied it does mean no good to preach a million Serv Soul it does me no good it does not make me Happ no I rather preach one sermon in my [Music] life look brother you need a total Deliverance not halfway because a part time Christian cannot defeat a fulltime devil H you [Applause] can't that enem is always watching there is no time that Satan do not watch is looking for a loople so if you want a part halfway Deliverance you want to take some things and leave others you can't defeat that full time en full time we need to claim we need to claim what belongs to us brother not to beg it to be given to us beg don't come to God and say I beg you I beg no sir you beg you are begging no don't beg you because it was already given to you you it has to be given to you demand for it by force tell the devil take off your hands take off your over my possession take off your dir over my wife take hallu brother you have chosen the wrong path because God showed him in a vision and he cried for him and he cried God don't let him end like that God his prayer the effectual fent prayer right man much and their children partake of the blessing a righteous man is brother told us is not man who has no wrongs what is someone that rep of their and forsakes them look brother come here my son you have chosen the wrong but you will come back no matter how far you go come back but in a hard way you will come back in sin will take you far than you want to go sin will hold you longer than you want to stay sin will cost you more than you want to when I read that I said God it will hold you long than the time you I want to see how is it that brother don't don't do and he went on he went on doing what he but trust me he came back in a way and no matter where he went no matter what he did Brother looked at those things and he called them lying [Music] vanities because he claimed him under the token Hallelujah Satan take off your hands of my children take off your hands of my job take off your hands of my blessing take off your hands of my Ministry Hallelujah you don't believe in in the ministry going further and further that's not what believe the message three Witnesses said when we seted out I asked the church lay their heads to lay their heads on the ground and that has made it to go all over the world because the scripture says into all if the motive is right Tru claim all that belongs brothers and sisters don't accept brother told us don't accept the devil's offer accept don't sign on it and when you don't sign it will return back to refuse refuse refuse to have a negative confession refuse refuse to take the devil's offer to take part things when God says all things there is no negotiation what Jesus died for for us on the cross when his life was in jeopard when his life he suffered Miser he laid down his life and in his sorrows in bitterness they slain him when he prayed and his tears blood when he suffered and my Lord died upon the cross and tell me that what he paid for I can't take it brother brother we must claim it and take it and see that Jesus the God that was with the prophet what he did with the prophet comes to us that have believed received the message what I want what I want what I ask God what I long for I said God only give me the life of this message that's all I want brother said stay with the word that the spirit of the word may come upon this person this other another that the spirit of the word might come upon the people now how do you expect the spirit of the word upon the people if you don't stay with the word stay with the word God gives the Holy Spirit does not obey his what the people thought was just say when he say to obedience to the word to the to the Scripture it is the scripture here in the book of Acts he was not just saying brother the word and God will give you the token taking all that belongs to us our Prophet preached a message a total Deliverance indicating that a Believer has to be totally delivered not deliverer without any negotiation as if that was not enough prach message possessing all things tell the believer that you possess all things in Christ Jesus as if that was not enough he went on again and he preached the message redemption in completeness telling the believer must be completely redeemed redeemed our love to Proclaim it Redeemed by the blood of the I think I cannot be silent
