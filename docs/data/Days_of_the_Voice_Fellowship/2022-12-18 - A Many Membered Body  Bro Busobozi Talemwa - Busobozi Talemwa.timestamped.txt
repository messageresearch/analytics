[1:04:52] has bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:04:54] called the sons of God

[1:06:00] praise the name of the Lord
[1:06:03] I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord
[1:06:05] this morning the message
[1:06:08] every one of you
[1:06:11] I want to first of all before we go into
[1:06:14] the scripture that we have read this
[1:06:15] morning
[1:06:17] I want to say that uh there are some who
[1:06:20] are not here with us this morning
[1:06:25] sister Monica she was not able to make
[1:06:27] it but she said she was going to be
[1:06:29] streaming
[1:06:33] December is a month of traveling for
[1:06:35] many almost
[1:06:38] you know going to be with family
[1:06:44] here's family they left to be with the
[1:06:47] family in
[1:06:55] the sister to the family of brother of
[1:06:59] sister praise
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:03] the ministers in this message
[1:07:08] I know that brother John her brother
[1:07:11] um
[1:07:19] I happen to talk to him this week and he
[1:07:21] sent his greetings to the church
[1:07:25] amen and uh my mother and and the rest
[1:07:28] of our family also traveled to uh be
[1:07:31] with her family
[1:07:36] but they sent their greetings as well
[1:07:41] um
[1:07:43] well there are some others but now I've
[1:07:46] always wanted to say that we to remind
[1:07:50] to remind you of our youth meetings
[1:07:55] now when we were when I was starting to
[1:07:58] arrange this youth meeting
[1:08:00] I did not expect it to be like big
[1:08:05] initially I was thinking should we just
[1:08:07] do our own youth meetings
[1:08:17] but then again I I felt since we are
[1:08:20] having a visiting Minister coming from
[1:08:22] Canada
[1:08:25] it's not good to be selfish
[1:08:30] Brethren from other churches
[1:08:34] so initially I thought that we would
[1:08:37] just have uh churches from around us
[1:08:39] here in campaign
[1:08:43] so then you would not need to make it
[1:08:45] resident meetings because they will just
[1:08:47] come and then go back
[1:08:50] so
[1:09:10] um and
[1:09:12] as of now I have a list of about about
[1:09:15] 50.
[1:09:19] and others have not given me the numbers
[1:09:23] I thought that we will need to make
[1:09:25] these meetings resident meetings
[1:09:31] so we will be beginning our services on
[1:09:35] Friday of 20th
[1:09:37] we shall have one service then
[1:09:41] in the evening and then we shall have
[1:09:45] two services on Saturday
[1:09:47] and two services on Sundays
[1:09:50] now of course that is in January so
[1:09:58] that is 20th of January to 22nd of
[1:10:01] January
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:03] um
[1:10:06] I'm still liaising with the owner of the
[1:10:09] school here
[1:10:12] and uh so far I was I met somebody that
[1:10:16] then they took me to meet the owner
[1:10:21] and so fight is they're positive
[1:10:25] and they might host us
[1:10:30] for for the dormitories
[1:10:34] so uh since I had not had not planned to
[1:10:37] make it a resident meeting
[1:10:41] until now we've not said anything
[1:10:46] and we might not actually know until the
[1:10:49] last minute
[1:10:51] I will make this open for anyone who
[1:10:54] wants a blessing to give you
[1:11:00] um
[1:11:01] I I know sometimes when you you do that
[1:11:04] many don't give um
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:07] but I believe in this Fellowship we are
[1:11:10] taught that when you give you are
[1:11:11] blessed is
[1:11:15] so plan on giving and giving a lot
[1:11:18] towards the success of those meetings
[1:11:22] at least all of you that work plan for
[1:11:24] like a hundred thousand you know
[1:11:26] something like that
[1:11:29] for that for those meetings because we
[1:11:33] shall be hurting uh the the young people
[1:11:36] that you will come and then leading them
[1:11:38] to Japanese and feeding everybody here
[1:11:41] at lunch
[1:11:42] so it's our first meeting of the kind of
[1:11:46] foreign
[1:12:01] to be preaching meetings
[1:12:03] it's going to be a time of refreshing
[1:12:06] for us
[1:12:09] as much as its younger youth meetings
[1:12:11] yet we have space the others can also
[1:12:14] join it
[1:12:16] whenever
[1:12:18] and also I'd like to say that uh brother
[1:12:24] my friend brother Isaac natural language
[1:12:32] has also confirmed this coming
[1:12:36] Amen brother Isaac and jerusa he works
[1:12:39] with the young people in their Church
[1:12:40] organizations
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:53] I've been there several times
[1:12:56] brother brother Isaac is
[1:13:00] um is uh he's been with me on a mission
[1:13:02] trip to Nigeria before
[1:13:07] he's a wonderful wonderful minister
[1:13:10] so he will be coming at least to
[1:13:12] minister service for us as well
[1:13:16] and I want to say plan big to do good
[1:13:20] things for us
[1:13:22] there is no reason absolutely why any of
[1:13:25] our younger people should plan to miss
[1:13:27] those meetings
[1:13:32] whatever plan you had the program
[1:13:35] for those three days I pray that you you
[1:13:39] just make it clear and make it available
[1:13:41] for you to be here
[1:13:45] there's going to be a lot of sacrifices
[1:13:48] for those who will come again
[1:13:51] brother Michael Ray confirmed is coming
[1:13:55] already
[1:13:57] but just is a air ticket and got the
[1:14:00] Visa already
[1:14:02] and I mean these are thousands of
[1:14:05] dollars
[1:14:06] so many people are going to spend a lot
[1:14:09] just to come here and be with them
[1:14:14] I believe God can't let that happen when
[1:14:16] he has not prepared something
[1:14:21] let's plan
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:15:08] I believe we shall also have a wonderful
[1:15:11] time there
[1:15:12] foreign
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:16:12] you know give well what how much we've
[1:16:15] given this year uh together but again
[1:16:19] what it has done

[1:17:18] who streams
[1:17:21] um
[1:17:31] do you uh uh what's the name of the
[1:17:35] brother
[1:17:39] the brother who streams
[1:17:41] oh okay
[1:17:43] so I the name just skipped my mind
[1:17:47] but I noticed that uh we here are
[1:17:50] relaxed a bit
[1:17:54] and uh but whoever whoever pledged
[1:17:57] something
[1:18:00] in the business meeting we are going to
[1:18:02] remind you everything you have not given
[1:18:06] together
[1:18:09] so that you can pay it is
[1:18:25] hallelujah hallelujah I said Hallelujah
[1:18:29] are you ready for the word this morning
[1:18:34] how many loved ones
[1:18:36] amen I mean I love the word too so this
[1:18:41] morning I'm speaking to you on a subject
[1:18:43] of a many member body
[1:18:45] [Applause]
[1:18:51] [Music]
[1:18:52] of love the father has bestowed upon us
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:18:59] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:19:04] you see each of us here has a father
[1:19:09] biological father so to speak
[1:19:12] some of your fathers have been very good
[1:19:15] and kind
[1:19:17] they've taken care of you ever since you
[1:19:20] were born
[1:19:21] and I've been there for you in thick and
[1:19:24] thin but at the world
[1:19:26] and some of you here are fathers
[1:19:30] who have been there for your families
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:46] amen Amina and then because the Bible
[1:19:50] says of course a father must be able to
[1:19:51] provide for his own Bible
[1:19:55] if we can't he is even worse than an
[1:19:58] infidelity
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:00] that's what the Bible says some of us
[1:20:04] have had fathers who were there for us
[1:20:06] at some point and then they disappeared
[1:20:11] but then you know it the scripture here
[1:20:16] when I read it I feel confident
[1:20:21] no but I I have a father
[1:20:25] who will never forsake
[1:20:28] I have a father who will never leave me
[1:20:31] I have a father who is mindful foreign
[1:21:28] and we are Heirs of that King
[1:21:31] the moment you receive the holy ghosts
[1:21:37] to that Kingdom so all of you here who
[1:21:41] belong to that category
[1:21:44] you are princess and prince
[1:21:50] so I'm talking to royalty this morning
[1:21:54] I'm not talking to commoners
[1:22:01] now you will know why we dress the way
[1:22:03] we dressed
[1:22:06] why do you dress the way you dress
[1:22:09] why why because you are Royals
[1:22:15] hallelujah amen lawyers don't dress me
[1:22:17] in his car trousers
[1:22:44] hallelujah amen that's why we dress
[1:22:47] suits
[1:22:48] when we come to church
[1:22:51] this is the greatest meeting you will
[1:22:54] ever
[1:22:57] seeing is not when you're meeting a
[1:22:59] president or some other person
[1:23:06] is here
[1:23:10] that's why I believe in dressing well
[1:23:15] yes I mean because you are coming to
[1:23:18] meet your father
[1:23:20] and your father is a king
[1:23:29] foreign
[1:24:03] what manner of love as the father
[1:24:05] bestowed upon us
[1:24:08] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:24:12] therefore the world knows
[1:24:16] because they knew him
[1:24:19] if you tell someone you're a son of a
[1:24:22] king
[1:24:24] and they can't understand
[1:24:26] don't be shocked if you tell them why
[1:24:30] you dress and they can't understand it
[1:24:33] again why you talk the way you talk and
[1:24:36] they can't understand
[1:24:37] why you behave the way you behave and
[1:24:39] they can't understand
[1:24:41] because they didn't understand your
[1:24:44] father
[1:24:47] they knew him
[1:24:49] therefore they can't know us
[1:24:53] beloved
[1:24:55] now are we the sons of God
[1:24:58] he didn't say we shall be the sons of
[1:25:01] God
[1:25:23] I am a Son of God
[1:25:27] hallelujah amen and listen to me for the
[1:25:31] results of God will overcome the world
[1:25:35] of God cannot be defeated
[1:25:49] because we are built in a way to
[1:25:52] overcome
[1:25:55] the devil sometimes can take some of us
[1:25:58] and throw them in the mouth
[1:26:03] thing he always forget
[1:26:05] that we are the seed of God
[1:26:08] not anyone that he has seen out there
[1:26:12] we are the sons of God
[1:26:19] listen the devil can have enough power
[1:26:24] take you in sin but he cannot have
[1:26:27] enough power to keep you there
[1:26:32] as long as you're a Son of God
[1:26:35] that's why Mikhail said
[1:26:38] it's not against me or my enemies
[1:26:53] that's why we sing a song
[1:26:55] the love of God is so great
[1:27:30] [Applause]
[1:28:01] he will never lose me foreign
[1:28:50] [Music]
[1:29:17] Romans 8 15 says for ye have not
[1:29:21] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:29:23] fear
[1:29:29] hallelujah amen there are foreign
[1:29:59] foreign
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:31] what if I serve God whatever
[1:30:33] tomorrow
[1:30:36] I know myself
[1:30:39] what if I sing the special song
[1:30:42] and then they find me doing this
[1:30:45] I know myself
[1:30:47] that's the devil lying to you
[1:30:50] and the Bible said God our father
[1:30:55] he has given us a spirit but that spirit
[1:31:00] of fear
[1:31:05] hallelujah hallelujah for you know your
[1:31:07] father once
[1:31:09] you will be careful for nothing
[1:31:14] you will serve him anyhow
[1:31:18] because you know you are bound to
[1:31:21] overcome
[1:31:24] you must overcome sin
[1:31:27] we must overcome your weakness
[1:31:30] the devil doesn't know that
[1:31:32] but let me tell you that is
[1:31:37] because God has already said it in his
[1:31:39] words
[1:31:40] that he has not given us the spirit of
[1:31:43] bondage
[1:31:46] we cannot be in bondage anymore
[1:31:49] because the spirit of our father
[1:31:52] takes us out of that bondage
[1:31:56] hallelujah amen and he says but he have
[1:32:00] received the spirit of adoption again
[1:32:16] the spirit of adoption
[1:32:19] to be adopted
[1:32:24] we'll get to that
[1:32:26] Ephesians 1 5.
[1:32:28] having predestinated us
[1:32:36] of children by Jesus Christ
[1:32:42] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:32:45] will
[1:32:48] hallelujah amen according to the good
[1:32:51] pleasure of his will
[1:32:55] he has predestinated us
[1:32:58] unto the adoption
[1:33:04] did somebody get that
[1:33:06] before you were even born
[1:33:11] was already there
[1:33:13] foreign
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:27] no wonder when the world came to you
[1:33:30] your heart agreed
[1:33:33] your body refused and he was stubborn
[1:33:37] for a while and you were in bondage
[1:33:39] foreign
[1:34:02] your adoption is not your boss
[1:34:08] your adoption
[1:34:10] is your blessing
[1:34:19] now that
[1:34:21] your birth
[1:34:24] goes this way
[1:34:27] when you hear the word
[1:34:29] breaks your heart
[1:34:35] you are Justified
[1:34:38] even when you were a sinner
[1:34:40] your father says now whatever you did I
[1:34:45] don't care I no longer see it you are
[1:34:49] Justified
[1:34:52] you are perfect
[1:34:56] just by believing The World
[1:34:59] God justifies
[1:35:02] that
[1:35:06] will count anymore
[1:35:12] is coming back for a perfect church
[1:35:24] God doesn't see any wrinkles
[1:35:28] where are the wrinkles
[1:35:33] they are back with the devil where they
[1:35:36] come from
[1:35:38] it is
[1:36:12] foreign
[1:36:57] when it justifies you
[1:36:59] you still have all the desires
[1:37:03] that he used to have
[1:37:06] you used to go to the Disco section
[1:37:10] and you used to like it
[1:37:13] now when it justifies
[1:37:17] the desire is still there
[1:37:43] that's why he has to bring you in his
[1:37:46] presence
[1:37:47] so that he can sanctify you
[1:37:51] can worship
[1:37:55] and he makes you perfect
[1:37:59] hallelujah amen our God is the greatest
[1:38:03] investor that on our family
[1:38:06] he doesn't worry about return on
[1:38:09] investments
[1:38:11] because it's true about his time
[1:38:16] when he invested on you boy
[1:38:22] Oh Glory to God he was sure his word was
[1:38:28] going to bring the reasons
[1:38:30] it's not about me or about you
[1:38:36] the world
[1:38:41] and make you a worthy member of the body
[1:38:44] foreign
[1:39:29] you can preach to somebody
[1:39:31] that they will believe
[1:39:35] that's easy but here's the hard part
[1:39:39] for them to be fully Sanctified
[1:39:49] only you can sit under that word
[1:39:54] you'll be finished you'll be finished
[1:39:56] yes
[1:40:07] but as long as you can overpower the
[1:40:09] devil
[1:40:10] there is
[1:40:13] so powerful that you will always
[1:40:15] overpower them
[1:40:18] God has confidence in that
[1:40:21] way and when you see another word
[1:40:30] sometimes when people come in the church
[1:40:36] and there is nothing within them to
[1:40:38] Quicken
[1:40:42] they will immediately be a friend down
[1:40:44] the road
[1:40:45] again you will say something from the
[1:40:48] world
[1:40:55] again that's how powerful the word is
[1:40:58] you It Happened One Day Jesus
[1:41:06] you can't eat my body massage
[1:41:32] I'll water down my gospel
[1:41:36] [Music]
[1:41:39] that's why preachers need to have a
[1:41:42] backup
[1:41:45] because I tell you it is very easy for a
[1:41:47] preacher to feel like you should water
[1:41:48] down the world
[1:41:59] they water down the preaching of the
[1:42:02] world
[1:42:03] so that everyone comes in
[1:42:06] so that a wish will come and they will
[1:42:09] feel comfortable
[1:42:13] so so that fornicator will sit oh no
[1:42:17] they won't feel anything
[1:42:19] they don't even say this is my church
[1:42:22] and they will not leave
[1:42:28] they adulterers
[1:42:38] in other words
[1:42:42] I'll keep you entertained as long as you
[1:42:46] can open your pocket
[1:42:49] foreign
[1:43:53] but for as many as I have the seed of
[1:43:55] God
[1:43:57] hallelujah amen they will fight
[1:44:02] till one day they will reach that day
[1:44:12] this is my day
[1:44:20] surrender my life
[1:44:32] amen that's what the word does
[1:44:37] sanctify
[1:44:39] by the preaching of it but after you are
[1:44:43] Sanctified
[1:44:45] there is another thing that happens
[1:44:49] amen God comes down
[1:44:52] the form of the Holy ghosts
[1:45:54] we are now a new creation

[1:55:38] when Jesus came on the earth yes he was
[1:55:43] the manifested son of the father yeah
[1:55:50] he had to prove his worthiness
[1:55:54] by going through the fire

[1:56:00] very things he suffered two kids
[1:56:10] and when he went through everything

[1:57:11] there are some prayers that will never
[1:57:13] be answered
[1:57:16] if we're a Son of God God cannot answer
[1:57:20] you in a prayer that is outside of his
[1:57:22] word
