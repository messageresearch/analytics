For you brought me. Yes, you saw me a mighty long way. Oh well, thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord for you brought me. Yes. You brought me a mighty long way. &gt;&gt; Oh well. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Oh, you brought me and you brought me a mile long way. Oh, well, you've been my father, you've been my brother, you've been my mother, my sister, too. For you sold me, and you've grown me a mighty long way. Oh well, thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord for you brought me. Yes. You brought me a mighty long way. You been my mother. You been my father. You been my brother. My sister too. Oh, you sought me and you brought me a my long way. A my long. Amen. He's been my mother. He's been my father. &gt;&gt; He's been my brother, been my sister. And he has brought me a mile long. But he and he's still taking me. Amen. Amen. God richly bless you. Thank you for your efforts [Music] always to be here. Uh God richly bless you and reward you for that. I do always desire to [Music] but the demand of Caesar Uh this time when pastor told me my supervisor had already told me I'm not going to be around on Saturday. night, you can't really make it to work on Saturday morning because there they want you by 7:20. Beyond that, a morning later beyond that you get a warning letter. Actually, it goes it goes you be expelled. So he had told me Saturday I'm not going to be around and as long as he's not there I have to be there. When I'm not there he has to be there. So I I met him I think around Wednesday when pastor told me to preach. I told him sorry but I want to talk to you. [Music] got a certain program. Actually, I told him I'm going to preach. He said, "Ah, but I already told you I'm not going to be alone." I told him, "I don't know what to do." He said, "All right, I'll stay." You go. Yeah. So he was really tired and exhausted, but he stood for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Exodus 23:29-30. The Bible says Exodus chapter 23 verse 29-30. I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. By little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land. Amen. [Music] Amen. You may take your seat. Just a few words to encourage you in the service of the Lord that you may press on towards the mark of thy calling in Christ Jesus. Nothing beyond that. But just what will encourage you to keep on believing, pressing on, trusting and abiding in Christ. In that simplicity, the simplicity of Christ, God will guard your hearts and minds till the day of Christ. Amen. Amen. You not see in this scripture uh if you see your neighbor dozing the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. Tell them you may wake up when we are not here. We've not gone home &gt;&gt; but when the Lord has taken us I'm afraid don't sleep. &gt;&gt; Just stay awake for a short while. So here he says, I will not drive them out from before thee in one year. I I I I will not drive them out from before you in one year. these Canonites and Hittites and Heites that were inheriting the promised land. God says, "Yes, I'm going to drive them out, but not in one year. Because if I do that, the land will become desolate." Oh God almighty, God is mighty. Why drive these fellows away quickly? He says, "If I do that, the land will become desolate and the beast of the field will multiply against you." You are still few. You are still little. You have not yet attended to that to possess the entire land. But little and little I will drive them out until you be increased and inherit the land. I will give you a portion by portion, little by little, a portion at a portion, one day at a time, until when you increase, then you inherit the entire land. But if I dare drive them away, the land will become desolate. Yourselves also will be consumed. Oh, you promised us the land. Just give us the land. He says fast you will live in the land of the promise with them but little by little I'll drive them home. God is in no hurry. That's my subject. God is in no hurry. Before I go further, I'll read a quotation. God talked to Moses 1953. The prophet says, "Write down to the end of the road. Write down to the end of the road." No. Going down to the end of the road. God will be faithful. You quit your doubting. Give over and give up. and let God. He said, "I will not give you the land in one year. For if I give you the world thing in one year, the wild beasts will come in and consume you. But little by little, as you are able, as you are able, I will give you the land as you are able. God is faithful to his promise. He says, "Quit doubting, give over, give up. Let go Paulo one day as he was sailing in that boat I believe that's actually 20 he says God told them they let loose the ship let it loose give it over to the wind the ship is going to crash but life will be saved You may be afraid to give up and let go. But give over give up. Something may crash but life will be saved. As you are able, God is in no hurry. He works in his own good time. And the timing of God is good. Listen brothers chapter 3, a common scripture. &gt;&gt; But Peter says, &gt;&gt; "I will not be negligant to keep you in memory or to remind you of these things. I will keep reminding you of the things that you know. Ecclesiastes chapter 3, he says, &gt;&gt; we go together, brother. To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose. To everything, not some things. everything there is a season and a time to every purpose. Every purpose has a time. Every time is for a purpose under heaven. A time to be born and a time to die. a time to plant and a time to break up that which is planted. There is a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to break down and a time to build up, a time to weep and a time to laugh. Maybe now is your time to to weep. but there is a time to love. When we talk about time, when something is put in time, it has a beginning and it has an ending. He says there's a time to mourn. There is a time to dance. You can't be sorrowful all the time. You can't be unhappy all the day. There is a time to mourn and a time to dance. Brother, sister, you can't be so unhappy. You can't be so cast down. There is a time to lift up. You can't look at us and show us attitude day after day, death after day. There's a time to rejoice, a time to cast away stones. You can carry burdens heavy like a stone. There is a time to cast them away. A time to gather stones together. A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a time to get. Listen brother and a time to lose. The people think listen brother. Job says to his wife, "Why speaks thou like one of the foolish women? Shall we only receive good from God and not evil?" Listen brother, there is a time to get prophets. There is a time to make a loss. You must understand the principles of God. But every loss comes with a certain good. But there is a time for that. It says a time to get and a time to lose. There is a time for you to work, a time to earn. But there is a time to give away. Brother, I sat and I thought, I said, God, if it wasn't you, I wouldn't have studied. If it wasn't you, I wouldn't have got the job of that. If it wasn't you, I wouldn't have got the money that I have. When I look, what do I lose to give away what you have given me? &gt;&gt; I don't lose anything because thou has given it unto me, brother. A time to get and a time to give away. There is a time to keep and a time to cast away. You have got to keep but there is a time to cast away brother. There is a time to ren and a time to sue a time to keep silence and a time to speak. You can't be chit chattering all the time. Chick. There is a time to quiet just for once. Don't be so. There is a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate. A time of war and a time of peace. What prophet as he that walketh in that wherein he labors I have seen travail which God has given to the sons of men. Listen to beised in it. God gives you travail. Be exercised in listen brother. physical exercise profitth but a little but spiritual exercise is profitable in all things if you don't want to give it yourself God gives it to you in He has made everything beautiful in his time. God has made all things beautiful in his own time. Maybe all you can see, all you can see, no goodness. Maybe that's what you're seeing. But he says in his own time, he makes everything beautiful. It turns ashes into beauty. It makes masterpieces from broken pieces. It can turn the tables around. But what the enemy meant for evil, God turns it around for my good. There is nothing happens to a believer that is haphazardly. That is by coincidence. Oh brother, &gt;&gt; when you get anything and bless it in time, it has got a beginning and an end. He says through everything there is a season. I don't know what it is that you are longing for. So Lord, there is a longing. There is a season and a time to every purpose. In other words, do you know the purpose of what you are long longing for? What purpose is it for? Sometimes we have things that we cry to God till when you come to a point and you say, "Oh Lord, how long like the souls that were under the altar? At the opening of the sixth seal, the souls under the altar and they said, "Lord, how long? How long? How long?" They were longing for virgin. How long shall it be? But he said, "Rest yet for it. I want to tell you brothers, rest for a little season, times and seasons. It's God who appoints these times. Men have schedules. Organizations have schedules. They have timets. They have a way they do their things. They have times for everything. They pay you for the time you have worked for at such a time you are supposed to be doing this. They have a program for the warrior. Where do they get the things and should you do anything that will make their program interfered? Brother, you are fired. But look brother, if money can be like that, they want to be so organized. Set a time for everything, a season for everything. Nevertheless, some of these things change by emergency. You and I set up things. But because of emergency things, you change time tables, because of human failures, we change time tables, we change schedules, we change programs, because of sicknesses, death, tax, some of course it there are things can't continue sometimes. Man's program, &gt;&gt; man's schedule meets the schedule of God. Look brother, if you ever set anything to be accomplished the next hour, the next day, the next minute. It is the future and there is no certainity in the hands of men that it is going to be unless it meets the program of God. So when you see it happening and you have planned it, you have a program for tomorrow. If you have a program for tomorrow, And you you fulfill that program just know that program &gt;&gt; met the program of God. &gt;&gt; Therefore you have got to plan. But in James chapter 4 13- 15 it says James chapter 4 13-15 he says [Music] go to now you that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city should we go together come over here you that say tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what shall be on tomorrow for what is your life? It is even a vapor that appearth for a little time and then vanishes away. For that you ought to say if the Lord will shall live and do this or that. God in simplicity. If the Lord will shall live and do this and that look because it's God who knows that time. Sometimes men set time problems. They run bankrupt. So man really keeps his time. But Jesus keeps all his appointment. The church is God's organization. It's not confused and disorderly. That's why the prophet had to preach a message. church order. God is a God of order. Is a God of order. He's never moved by conditions. God is moved by his time. So brother, this condition this condition. That is not what moves. God is moved by his not your time. He's tired. God has a time table. That's why the prophet preached a message, the junction of time. He says we come to this junction that now the church has to be restored. This is where he sends Malachi 4. He says when he says we turn to this junction you turn to that junction the way of the word. Look brother he has the time table. They wandered in the wilderness and wondered and wondered and God was looking at them. But he said, "You have wandered on this mountain too long, turning northwards." The time God says, "Too long." It was really too long. So God has got a time table. Sometimes you want things so quickly. So quickly. So quickly. You want it so quickly. In a moment. In a tinkling of an eye. The moment I pray like this, I open my eyes. Let there be. Open your eyes. There isn't. But there is. The problem is thou seeest not as the bonds form in the womb. Tell me how come to bonds start to form. The problem is You want things so quickly, [Music] but if it's not God's time, you can't force it. And when it is time, you can't stop it. letting off the pressure &gt;&gt; 1965. &gt;&gt; It says, "Get it over here." &gt;&gt; No, no. 1962. I' read wrongly. Here he says paragraph 34. So then I thought, &gt;&gt; what would I speak to this congregation? I thought well they are probably trained right in everything no doubt but there is a pressure on the people today and that pressure has no limitation. or any denominational lines or any denominational lines. It has no edge line. So you can't say pressure is for the aged it has no it has no respect of person can't say I'm too spiritual I'm a man of God I'm so spiritfilled I believe that no doubt but it has no respect of You can't say I'm still young. You can't say I'm too old to worry. Soon I'm going anyway, Lord. I'm waiting. I'm ready to go. I've been faithful in your sons. I'm just too old. Bit tired. There's no need for pressure. It's on young and old. good and bad. You can't say I'm too good don't be under pressure to want something quickly. I want God to hurry hurry. It's on everybody pressure. We are living in a neurotic age. neurotic I don't know how to say it exactly nervous tension everybody resting here and going there and going nowhere you know why you are just trying to hurry You are just on a rush. You are going nowhere. Everybody's resting here. [Music] Someone in the market is on a rush said fish and we all looking the man is not carrying. He just wanted to hurry. So we learned the same thing also in the market. because you rush and going there and going nowhere. It is just to that kind of an age. And and I know this church would be plagued with it [Music] as everywhere is plagued with it. It says tabernacle is plagued with it. everywhere the whole world. Someone is saying, "No, brother. I'm preaching the message. You get in a rush. I want to fulfill my pledge very fast. I'm worried. I'm married. My brother is going to call. You are rushing forward, brother. You made the pledge. You brought the empty vessel. Allow God. You didn't make the pledge to worry and be so bothered, sorrowful, brother. Allow God. Allow God. God is in no hurry. Listen, when you we say God is no in no hurry. It doesn't mean that God does not know the deadlines. Sometimes God even extends deadlines. Other times it comes at the last day. But look, it fulfills his promise. Listen, God is in no hurry. Who prov you but not the Lord? God is in no hurry. It's a day of pressure. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry up. God is in no hurry. Brother, I want to finish up here. God knows where to finish. Hurry, hurry, hurry up and wait. Drive 90 miles an hour driver. What's the matter with you fellow? We have got to go. Come up. Let us move. This man came to work. Please don't rush the man. Be a Christian enough. Drive 90 miles an hour. And then to get home for supper and wait 2 hours till it gets ready. That's right. It's a time and in that rushing and speeding it gets you to another station. Listen brother, the wife will say something a little contrary. You want to fly off. temper. Husband says something. Let the husband say something like, you and tell him to get in the room. Well, now husband, I don't want no words with you. Go out to them. Please don't talk to me. I don't want I don't want wife. Oh, I'm so nervous. See why? What's the matter? All of this together, this tension building up, then the results of it is doing something wrong. I love the truth because the Christian the Christian heart no matter how hard the truth is that's what it needs the results of this this hurry hurry hurry right rushing is doing something wrong and acting getting out of place.

But there's nothing we have done. You are just all pressured up and pivoted. That's the matter. You are rushing God. You can't lead God. Let God lead you. It will make the poor act that way. I'm all poor. Oh God. They start to rush. It will make middle class act that way. I want to get to the top. It will make the rich act that way. I want to remain on top.

What are you rushing about? &gt;&gt; You are rushing. &gt;&gt; Oh, papa. Don't rush. Now, we find that it builds up as the day goes. You talk to your boss. If you are working, people came to work when they are fine but they they have pressure and they had to start meditation and you wonder what good is the payment doing anything good. Brothers and sisters in overloaded with loans. This one you are trying to rush. I'm not saying it's bad to do that. I'm only saying there are people that are moved by attention just rushing and it's not God's time. A borrower is a slave to the render. If you are working al so and so and if you speak to the kid to the kid come in here mama I am there you are it builds up says oh my you feel like you are your head is going to come off. There are people that get in a rush. People get in a rush and they say, "My head is boiling. Don't blow me. I know I am with it every day. So I know what it means. It builds up. It's just becoming an erotic age. Everybody is all built up. Haven't got no time. I have no time. I have no time. I have no time. I have no time. I have no time to rest. I have no time to sleep. I have no time to talk to someone. I have no time to do this. I have no time to come back. I have no time. You got time. You are just on the rush. and you are going nowhere. You got all the time. A time to rest, a time to serve, a time to work, a time to pray, a time to sing, a time to praise, a time to have time with the friends, brother, sister, a time to fellowship with us. You got all the time. I've got no time. You got the time. You are just on the rush. And that builds up to a place that breaks up things. You will break your friendship. You will break your fellowship. You will break your marriages. You're rushing your wife. You're rushing husband. It causes people to have hard feelings. The prophet is speaking. It makes people to have hard feelings. [Music] Just feel why are you feeling bad? &gt;&gt; Tell me why are you feeling bad? You are just rushing &gt;&gt; when they snap them off and say things you don't mean to say. You are rushing pap. You need to give God a little bit of time. Give him a little bit of time. It doesn't matter your cry. I've cried too long. &gt;&gt; I have cried too long. Oh God. And it has not moved you. Which scripture says your cry moves. It does. It does. But in his time Look brother, sister, &gt;&gt; you don't cry &gt;&gt; for something to be done. God makes you himself to cry that when it happens, you appreciate it. But it is meant to happen because God has for ordained your test. But predestination looks to for knowledge. A predestinated person will behave as a predestinated person. If you say I won't do anything about it, It's a sign you are not predestinated. But if you predestinated to it, he puts a burden within you. Look brother, that burden is a hook that God puts in a man's heart therewith. God doesn't give man. If God doesn't give man a vision, a person is going to be so hard to guide because he has no burden. But a vision is a pattern that God puts in a man's heart. And this man, he has to live or die for that. It is the will of God. Keep that man. A vision is a hook to bring to come to pass that God predestinated to come to pass. There's nothing catches him by surprise. He's never afraid of any man's prayer. I'm done. No, no, no, no. How did this happen? How did you get a car? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's a good one. Brother, you are inspired. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am afraid if so and so prays. I wasn't prepared. Let's hurry up. Let us go and meet Mary 100 years. God has appointed times. Do you know where the book of Abak is? you get to that book uh Habac we read chapter two uh uh verse 2-3 it says and the Lord answered me and Write the vision. Make it plain upon tables that he may run that reads it. Make it plain. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end, it shall speak and not lie. Though it wait for it because it will surely come. It will not say no. Wait for it. It will speak and not lie. Wait for God to answer in his own time. teaching on Moses. But little boys and girls, does God hear prayer? It's a question. He hears prayer. Does God answer prayer? Yeah. He answers prayer. Does he answer real quick? Not all the time does he? No. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he makes us wait, [Music] the longer they wait, the greater the testimony. [Applause] Adoption chapter 3. We all want to be led by the spirit. We all want that. Just what the spirit says, do then do it quickly. That's not rushing. Uhhuh. You are just in God's time. We are not rushing about buying the church. Brother, we are rushing. We are just in God's time. When you in God's time, you are not rushing pap. No matter how fast you are, you are not rushing. How has that young fellow made it like that? Rushing. Rushing. It is easy season, brother. He's not rushing. You just watch him. Someone is rushing and someone in his season, they are different. They may be resting at the same speed. One is the other one is rushing. He's just rushing, goinghere. just what the spirit says do then do it quickly. And let us remember while we are obeying the spirit one great lesson that we want to learn is never be hastily never rush. See take your time. Have faith. If we have asked God anything brother, I have prayed. &gt;&gt; Did you pray? Brother, &gt;&gt; I've prayed. But brother, &gt;&gt; it is tomorrow. It is tomorrow. Brother, did you pray? &gt;&gt; Brother, I prayed. &gt;&gt; You are behaving as if you didn't pray. Because &gt;&gt; he says take your time have faith. If we have asked God anything remember God answers prayer. He does it in his time. Listen the way it is best. &gt;&gt; You want something gives me you are rushing in his time the way it is best. makes it work just right for us. A good and faithful servant is one that waits for his master's time. God knows what is best for you and when to give it to you and how to give it to you. &gt;&gt; But you are rushing. That's your problem. You are Russian papa for anything of God has an appointed time. It has a season. It has a purpose and it comes through the person that he has chosen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not everyone you meet connection connection connection connection connection by the person he has chosen trying to do God a service without it being his will. I want to wind up here. It says &gt;&gt; 1965 &gt;&gt; 0718 M paragraph 108. I just had little bit of quotations here. &gt;&gt; We are together brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; God is in no hurry. Is you and I that gets in a hurry said, "How great are your thoughts towards me? They cannot be numbered. You can't tell me that God is thinking about you day and night and that he has missed something." No, God hasn't missed anything. is just waiting for the appointed time. &gt;&gt; But now not. &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. I was 108. Now not there in following God. Now I want you to kind of jot this in your mind to keep God's commandments. to do God to do anything right for God. Amen. To do God a service correctly. [Music] There is five musts to do God's service correctly. these five musts. I want you to remember this. I want you to remember this. No matter how sincere a man may be in doing it, doing goddess service, these five musts must be there first. fast. &gt;&gt; It must be time to do it. Oh my my. You must be in his time. It must be in his season. You got that now? It must must be his time. One, &gt;&gt; it must be his season. Two, it must be according to his word. That has been spoken, it must. I don't care how well you said this ought to be or that ought to be. It has got to be according to his word, according to his time and his season. Those are three. It must be according to the person he has chosen to do it by. Those are four. I don't care how much dignaries. How prepared and how ready you feel. Brother, sister, how mature you think you have grown. Brother, sister, God has a way of doing it. But you always fail to do it. It must be according to his work, according to his time, according to his program and it must be by the person he has chosen to do it and to do it. Those are four. And the pro it must be it has got to be it must come to the prophet. &gt;&gt; You know everything it starts right here. The vision is given to the pastor. You know he gives it out for the entire church. A vision is given to a minister for that day for that day need there for that time for someone to get something A New Testament preacher is a prophet. So those are five musts. But he says first it must be his time. Second is his season. Again the man he has chosen today and then it has to be according to his word. And then he says it has got to come to his prophet. But you rush papa. It's so unfortunate that the people often times miss God in his time and wait for him to come in their time. God has put times and seasons in his own power. The Bible says shall come to pass in the last days. Second Peter 3, there shall come mockers. They say where is the promise of his coming? Since our fathers died, he has not come. He has not come. He says this. They are willingly ignorant. But the Lord is not slack concerning his promise. A day a thousand years is like one day before God. So he he's not he's in no hurry. The Lord will come in his own appointed time, his own time which he has appointed. You will start to complain and mama because you are rushing. Brother, God is not in a hurry. Brother Job, brother Job. Brother Job [Music] way. Just your home. You a boy. You brothers are like this mommies. Leave that child. &gt;&gt; Calm down. God is hurry. God is in no hurry. Always remember before you rush someone you've also ever been there. &gt;&gt; So don't rush someone and don't rush yourself. God is in no hurry. I'm emphasizing that because we always try to rush as it was then the people waited for the Messiah. They knew that he was coming. The Bible says the prophets searched out what time the Messiah was coming, but he could not come until the f the time that was appointed was full and now I wanted to hear I don't know I think it's now I've taken one hour just get done here. I want to tell brothers and sisters, God won't give you anything until the time appointed has come to the fullness. Do you think the world didn't need a savior? Why was God waiting for all those years? Well, the world needed a savior right that very day in the garden. Why did he slay the lamb, take them by shadows? It had an appointed time. Why God is in no hurry? I wonder why isn't he in a hurry because everything he has ordained it for ordained it fixed he can't change it can't change my destiny that's not in the believers he's not going to change the destiny. It's already fixed. I know my destiny. Colossians 4:1-5. Now I say that the hair as long as he is a child defant. though he be lord of all but God has given us all these things but it looks as if we are like all these other don't have God as long as he is a child He found nothing for my servants. He wants you to grow. You know some believers. They have the Holy Spirit. It's not about their spiritual growth, but naturally your natural age also has an effect on how you behave. Whether you have the Holy Spirit or not, like it or not, it has an effect on how you behave. but is under tutors and governors. As long as is a child does not differ from a servant, but is under tutors and governance until the time appointed of the father. until the time appointed by the childh being tutored. Don't rush. Allow God to tutor you until the appointed time for your marriage, for your job, for your ministry, whatever you desire and long for, God is in no hurry. Even so we when we were children who are in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of the time was come, when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law. might receive the adoption of Jesus. He waited till the fullness of time. My dear sister, don't rush your husband. Brother, don't rush your wife. Preacher, don't rush the members. Don't rush the people. I preached about this yesterday. I brush that in the overnight still rushing and then I'm also rushing. There is a season of everyone. God only demands you to believe it. God's in no hurry. It's you and I who try to hurry up that way. But as long as God has spoken, it is as good as done. But the people want to plant today and a vest the next day. Impatient, get rich overnight, gambling, you will get poor the following morning. The power of the devil. Watch little things when they boil up and start at first. You know, mushrooms grow up overnight and die the next day. Take a long time. It takes a long time for an old oak to come. But he is really rooted. ungrounded when he gets there. God doesn't want to take you up there and everyone looks at you and they say, "Glory, glory. Really this man has God. Then before you know, you are down." You bring a li the name of Christ. You got to be rooted and grounded. not like mushroom. Allow God to take you one step at a time. It will give you experience. It will build your confidence and you will appreciate yourself. Wait for God to open the door. Don't try to do it yourself. Brother, God has done it for brothers. He's seeing you. But your time is not my time. It's not brother. You also have your time. And when I get tired, you also have to come with strength. And when you also get tired also come with enough strength. &gt;&gt; And for that wait to God open that door. Don't try to do it yourself because it won't work. Sometimes we think we are delayed. And we think we have been denied. But what I can say, it was simply divinely interrupted. Just a divine interruption. God is delays are not deniers. God will always make a way. I'm done, brother. Where there is no way, God is uh God will always make a way or else. He will become the way &gt;&gt; where there is no way in his own way and in his own time. He makes a way where there is no way in his own way and his own time because his ways are not your ways and his ways are past finding out. God is the season is your right season. God is the time is your right time. Blessed is that man that med the word of God day and night is like a tree planted by the which bring forth in his season fruit. Amen. in his season, in the season of God. The problem with the fig tree, I wondered why did Jesus cast the fig tree for not having fruits. It was not yet the time of fixing. Little pastor told me, "Brother, it was not yet the time of figs to bring forth fruits, but it was the time of God to seek a fruit from the fig tree. [Music] It's not about brother, it's not my time. It's not my time. I'm still young. I'm still young. I'm old. I'm If it's God the time, brother, you are in danger. Two fruits, brother. Mr. M's impatency. Mr. and Mrs. impatency. If you are here, I'm calling your attention now to a courty trial. Let us sit now in a courty. Mr. and Mrs. I want to bring your attention to this. the trial. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, &gt;&gt; I read in the name of the Lord, &gt;&gt; paragraph 68, he says, uh, I'm done. I'm done just here. this. So, Mr. Impatient or Mrs. Impatient comes and he claims remember we are in a trial. &gt;&gt; The prosecutor is the devil. Now, the prosecutor is Mr. Impatience and Mrs. Impatience is the one we want to look at now. So impatience and he claims that he one day was reading the Bible. He didn't go to churches but he was a believer. So one of them went to an evangelist and the other one went to a pastor. This fellow was just a secret believer. He stayed home and he went and he was reading in Mark the 11th chapter the second and 23rd verse where Jesus himself claiming to be God made his statement with his own lips. Every I say unto you, whosoever shall say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you have said will come to pass. You can have what you have said. And he said also that when you pray, believe that you receive what you ask for it shall be given to you. He says has been lame in his feet for about 25 years. And five years ago while sitting in a room feeling that he was inspired to read the word which he claims he believed. And with all his heart he believed. it and he then said with his own voice in my legs in the name of Jesus Christ leave me he said and that's been five years ago and is just as crippled as he ever was. Oh, therefore, Mr. Mrs. impatient wants to put his testimony against the word saying the word is not a valid. He wants to put it against the Bible being the inspired word and he says that this promise is not true. He has tested it and it wasn't true. Therefore, now the defense witness comes because we have to defend this the word now. We want Mr. Mrs. Impatient here that fellow that has been rushing. We want to free you from that spirit. He wants you this call this court his attention again the defense witness the the Holy Spirit. He wants to call this court and show you that the promises is only to believers not make believers. not impatient or skeptics. It is to believers only not to the impatient. If you have got real genuine faith, you will have real genuine patience. Patience, patience. It says in the message shalom, patience, patience. Some of us get so in such a hurry. I think many a good man has done that. You get in too much of a hurry because you want to do it yourself. Let us stand on our feet as I read James chapter 5 here verse 7 to 11 he says be patient therefore brethren to the coming of the Lord. Behold the husbandman &gt;&gt; waits for the precious fruit of the earth. and has longer patience for it until he receives the early and later. Be also patient. Est establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draws nigh. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the judge stands before the door. Take my brethren, the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering, affliction, and of patience. Behold, we count them happy which endure. [Music] You have heard of the patience of Job and you have seen that the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercies as a father pies his children. The Lord pies them that he loves. Brother, sister, God is in no hurry. Teach me Lord to wait down till you good. You are my &gt;&gt; teachers [Music] do in prayer. for a nice you upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall with wind. [Music] &gt;&gt; They shall run and not be weary.

As we are going to approach prayer, you know the message we have heard tonight, I believe that you can tell it has been inspired of the Lord and it is it has been spiritual food in your season. [Music] I believe this is the season that God wanted you to hear that. Maybe you might have been discouraged or maybe things are happening slower than you wanted them to. Maybe you have questions about your life. But as we are going in a place of prayer tonight, I want you to understand that he's the strength to those who are weak and everything is right on time. You don't have to rush anything. When Lazarus was dead, he was he was stinking four days. Then Jesus showed up and it looked like he was late. But are you not so glad to know that he is never late? He's never late. He can never be late in our lives. He comes right on time. Amen. And when he comes, When the Lord shows up in your situation, he's ready to raise the dead. He's ready to change the situation. Amen. And as long as it is his season, his time, the season of the bringer of the fruit. He's the one that brings forth the fruit. And when he comes, no one can lock the door that he has opened. [Music] So that goes to us to trust on him. Amen. Let us sing this one more song as we go to prayer. You are my strength. Sing it in your heart. Strength like no other. [Music] Strength like no other. [Music] Reaches to me. You are my hope. You are my hope. &gt;&gt; Come on, tell him now. Oh no, like no other.
