[0:02] my wife and I a few years ago
[0:08] took a trip to uh to Ethiopia Ethiopia
[0:15] but uh before we got married we knew
[0:18] that the Lord had a you know a mission
[0:20] for us there tonight
[0:25] it started about three years before I I
[0:30] got married actually
[0:34] and I wanted to go to Ethiopia
[0:38] because at that time I was you know
[0:40] traveling from place to place
[0:45] [Music]
[0:46] you know several African countries
[0:52] but now it became intense in 2011 when I
[0:55] went to
[0:57] Zimbabwe for a mission trip
[1:05] it would appear that whenever I open my
[1:07] bible to read
[1:11] God will draw my attention on Ethiopia
[1:17] Ethiopia I would read about Ethiopia
[1:19] guys so much even places I never
[1:20] expected the Bible was speaking about
[1:22] Ethiopia I would say Ethiopia
[1:29] and so when I returned home
[1:35] then I I um Pastor my pastor then Pastor
[1:40] Leo invited a Vista from Congo I think
[1:43] um
[1:47] and spoke about Ethiopia like he's
[1:50] mentioned about Ethiopia about 10 times
[1:59] and so it drew my attention
[2:03] [Music]
[2:05] now wanting to find out whether they
[2:07] were Believers in Ethiopians
[2:11] it turned out that there seemed not to
[2:13] be a church even a church of the message
[2:16] in Ethiopia
[2:20] so one time I went to sorority
[2:29] Pastor Charles
[2:33] introduced me to a brother who had been
[2:36] in Ethiopia um
[2:42] this brother had visited another brother
[2:44] in Ethiopia
[2:47] so apparently this brother was from
[2:50] Kenya yeah
[2:53] and so we tried to contact him to allow
[2:57] us to come and visit
[3:01] this is what he told me
[3:03] he said well of course after several
[3:07] words that were exchanged
[3:11] and he had asked me a few questions
[3:15] like how old are you numbers
[3:17] are you married
[3:19] are you a preacher how long did you
[3:23] start preaching from the time you
[3:24] believed
[3:25] foreign
[3:30] and then he asked me a little more
[3:33] questions
[3:34] and then it seemed that I failed the
[3:37] interview
[3:39] [Music]
[3:43] I'm sorry I cannot receive you in
[3:44] Ethiopia
[3:50] and also it doesn't seem that uh the
[3:54] field is large two friends
[3:57] you don't even have money
[3:59] and it's expensive yeah
[4:04] even the language is difficult they
[4:06] don't speak English
[4:09] so it's difficult for me to receive you
[4:11] here
[4:13] I cannot sustain you the sins are Queen
[4:16] Elizabeth and I don't feel like to
[4:18] receive you
[4:21] the field is large singers if God has
[4:25] sent you you will take care of it
[4:30] that's what he told me and I was so
[4:34] disappointed
[4:35] [Music]
[4:36] friends sometimes when you are turned
[4:38] down
[4:40] [Music]
[4:41] it doesn't mean that God has turned you
[4:43] down
[4:44] [Music]
[4:45] sometimes when you are turned down it is
[4:47] that God is opening
[4:52] and so I was turned down
[4:56] and
[4:57] um but somehow because of that I went
[5:00] before the Lord
[5:02] and I prayed a sincere prayer
[5:06] say Lord if it is your will for me to go
[5:08] to Ethiopia
[5:11] may you provide to me the money
[5:15] sent that I would not have to ask
[5:16] anybody because
[5:19] I need money to go there
[5:22] you and um also I said Lord may you also
[5:26] give me a contact
[5:29] someone I will not need to beg to come
[5:34] so uh about a year and a half later
[5:39] in 2013.
[5:43] I was supposed to get married actually I
[5:46] was supposed to get married in December
[5:48] of 2012.
[5:52] but then I saw this dream
[5:55] and in this dream I I saw myself
[5:59] um change someone asking me to change my
[6:02] wedding date
[6:07] this would be a signature
[6:11] that person that will ask me to do that
[6:13] will be the one to solemnize my wedding
[6:20] so I shared that with my pastor at that
[6:23] time
[6:25] we read about it and ignored it
[6:28] two weeks later
[6:30] out of all the friends and brothers in
[6:33] the ministry that I had sent out email
[6:35] to inform them about my wedding
[6:40] one of them wrote back
[6:43] and and he told me look he said brother
[6:46] brother we are our church
[6:50] is intending to have their students
[6:53] because they have a church school
[7:01] to come to Uganda
[7:03] Uganda we are going to visit Pastor
[7:05] Stephen ibalist Church in ginger
[7:06] together
[7:09] if you accepted me to come
[7:12] I said if you accepted to change your
[7:15] debts
[7:18] from December to March when we are when
[7:21] they are coming
[7:24] because my daughter is coming with them
[7:28] I will take it as from the Lord also for
[7:31] me to come along
[7:36] so this dream this what this email was
[7:41] saying was exactly revealed to me in the
[7:43] dream two weeks before it happened
[7:49] so it was not a problem I told Pastor
[7:52] Leo he had already known about it
[7:57] was the one supposed to Wed me and my
[7:59] wife
[8:01] eventually God had already organized for
[8:04] this brother to come and wear them yeah
[8:07] but here is what we did not know
[8:11] God was also dealing with him and and
[8:14] his church in Canada
[8:19] about Ethiopia
[8:21] they had a burden to support the working
[8:24] ethics
[8:32] mechanism but they had the money to go
[8:35] yeah
[8:38] and I was in Uganda you don't have the
[8:42] money to go because
[8:45] I didn't have the money
[8:47] but I want you to see God working on
[8:49] both sides
[8:55] so when this brother comes to Uganda
[8:58] received him at the airport with the
[9:00] other Elders
[9:03] they were about 17 young people that
[9:06] came with them so
[9:14] he
[9:19] said where are you going
[9:22] to your honeymoon
[9:24] [Music]
[9:27] and they said we are not planning a
[9:29] honeymoon
[9:31] because we have
[9:34] all the resources we put them in the
[9:36] wedding and since
[9:40] and so he said ah I have a proposal in
[9:44] each day so why don't you go to Ethiopia
[9:47] for your honeymoon
[9:52] years after the prayer I pray
[9:57] before I was ever in contact with this
[10:00] brother
[10:02] and and so at when he said he mentioned
[10:05] Ethiopia boy are you getting a question
[10:07] and he was saying honeymoon
[10:18] because this brother said I am going to
[10:21] take care of all the expenses
[10:23] [Music]
[10:41] but because of a prayer that God
[10:44] answered so perfect
[10:47] so perfect yeah
[10:50] three years before um
[10:57] all the money we needed is
[11:01] [Music]
[11:07] when the brothers and the sisters in our
[11:09] little church had that I was planning
[11:11] honeymoon to Ethiopia
[11:14] that is
[11:17] some of them were offended
[11:20] because I remember there was a family
[11:22] that sold their piglets
[11:27] to support my wedding
[11:30] so they said if we had money
[11:41] this was completely Supernatural
[11:45] and so now I'm on the computer with my
[11:48] wife
[11:54] and here's what God does
[11:57] someone calls me from Nairobi Nairobi
[12:01] never met him don't know him
[12:05] but he was on the internet internet and
[12:08] he read my website my website it says
[12:12] about me on our website
[12:14] website if you want you young people you
[12:16] can look for it the youth message site
[12:23] so you saw my testimony
[12:25] he was impressed
[12:28] that the Holy Spirit
[12:33] to invite me to Kenya and Peter Kenya to
[12:37] go and baptize the people that had
[12:39] believed under his ministries
[12:43] but here is the testimony
[12:45] those people were Ethiopians Ethiopia
[12:51] so when he mentioned to me I have a
[12:55] group of Ethiopians
[12:58] and God has told me ask you especially
[13:03] you um
[13:04] [Music]
[13:06] immediately I knew that that was God
[13:09] answering the second prayer
[13:13] please stay on the first slide
[13:19] so then when we are in Nairobi Nairobi
[13:24] uh this brother brings this man
[13:27] and uh and uh I I of course we changed
[13:30] our trip we decided to go to Nairobi
[13:32] fast
[13:35] and we met this Ethiopian man said
[13:38] and this man was uh very happy to see us
[13:41] yes it was the very first Ethiopian I've
[13:44] ever interacted with yeah
[13:48] said you were delaying 2012 I need to be
[13:52] baptized they took him at one of the
[13:54] neighboring churches
[13:56] the church we visited recently in
[13:58] Nairobi challenge
[14:03] that man there the traumatism in the
[14:07] name of our Lord Jesus
[14:16] he gave us a contact of his brothers
[14:24] foreign
[14:46] so that is that is me and my wife on our
[14:49] wedding day
[14:53] 2013.

[15:15] excuse me
[15:18] so this is the man I don't know whether
[15:20] you can see him clearly there
[15:23] his name is
[15:27] I believe those who are online can view
[15:29] this better and if you want to view it
[15:32] in a better way you can view this after
[15:33] the service
[15:34] so uh you see the man standing behind
[15:37] there
[15:40] and if you see the man on the extreme
[15:43] right
[15:47] I always forget his name but maybe I'll
[15:49] remember it
[15:50] and so that is the man that called me
[15:53] and I met him there for the first time
[15:57] baptism Pastor rather the man called the
[16:01] reasons
[16:03] you can see I was very little and
[16:05] smaller

[16:19] there

[17:06] approached me
[17:10] yes so that man said yoyo believed from
