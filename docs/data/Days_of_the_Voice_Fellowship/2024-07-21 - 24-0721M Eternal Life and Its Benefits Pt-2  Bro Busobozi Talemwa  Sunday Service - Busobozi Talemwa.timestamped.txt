[1:09:10] saying it's difficult to deal
[1:09:13] with and so seeing the flow made even if
[1:09:19] we had the
[1:09:22] money it would have been very difficult
[1:09:26] to make
[1:09:28] this without
[1:09:30] brother
[1:09:32] because he has been
[1:09:34] here for a full
[1:09:37] week he was the one with our
[1:09:40] funds protecting your
[1:09:43] funds ensuring it is not used for any

[1:14:47] this will be a part two of
[1:14:54] them verily verily I say unto you he
[1:14:57] that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:14:59] him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:15:02] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:15:04] is passed from Death un
[1:15:21] life we have a request here
[1:15:25] from Sister
[1:15:28] Joan um she request that we pray for her
[1:15:34] sister what's sister's
[1:15:40] name not you not
[1:15:43] you which request is
[1:15:51] this the
[1:15:57] oh okay
[1:16:23] okay
[1:16:53] e
[1:17:23] e e
[1:18:11] is actually what happens immediately
[1:18:13] after the
[1:18:16] rupture when the rupture
[1:18:19] happens those who go in the
[1:18:22] Rapture will come before the judge
[1:18:25] seat of
[1:18:28] Christ does speak of
[1:18:31] it and I just read it to you here
[1:18:35] briefly praise the name of the
[1:18:43] Lord and many people think they confuse
[1:18:46] those two
[1:18:50] things and they think that every human
[1:18:52] being will be before the white throne
[1:19:00] and that's not
[1:19:02] true praise the name of the
[1:19:06] Lord um can you please read for for us
[1:19:09] brother Romans 14:
[1:19:36] now this is not the white Throne
[1:19:42] judgment you see many times when you
[1:19:44] preach scouching
[1:19:49] things people will tell you no don't
[1:19:51] judge
[1:19:53] me scriptures like
[1:19:55] this they say why are you
[1:19:58] judging shall all be before the white
[1:20:00] before the Judgment seat of
[1:20:04] Christ this judgment seat of
[1:20:07] Christ is not judging us to give us life
[1:20:11] or den of
[1:20:14] Life whoever will come before this
[1:20:17] judgment
[1:20:19] SE will already have previously received
[1:20:23] life
[1:20:26] are you following me now praise the name
[1:20:28] of the Lord so you see this judgment
[1:20:32] seat is like the the accountability
[1:20:38] place of what we
[1:20:42] did we
[1:20:44] live even if we we have already attained
[1:20:47] eternal
[1:20:48] life and we are children of God we saved
[1:20:52] and we have gone into the rapture
[1:20:55] it doesn't mean that God will not judge
[1:20:58] the little things that we
[1:21:02] did he will judge it so watch everything
[1:21:05] you
[1:21:07] do he an allseeing eye that
[1:21:11] watches he watches everything you do he
[1:21:14] watches everything you say the little
[1:21:16] things and the big things and all of us
[1:21:20] now here remember this scripture it was
[1:21:22] Paul speaking to the Believers
[1:21:26] and he was including
[1:21:30] himself who will come before the
[1:21:32] Judgment seat of
[1:21:35] Christ
[1:21:36] before before meaning they will stand
[1:21:40] before the
[1:21:42] Jud so they will be judged so it sounds
[1:21:46] like as if it will be the white Throne
[1:21:50] judgment will receive etal life
[1:21:54] will know but that is not speaking about
[1:21:59] that this is actually speaking about
[1:22:05] accountability we the Believers who
[1:22:09] would have gone into the
[1:22:10] Rapture stand before that judgment
[1:22:15] seat in heaven that judgment seat will
[1:22:18] be in
[1:22:19] heaven and we shall give
[1:22:23] accountability the things we were given
[1:22:25] into our
[1:22:28] stewardship I mean down even to the
[1:22:31] little
[1:22:32] things gifts that God gave
[1:22:35] you how did you use it did you use it to
[1:22:38] further the
[1:22:40] word you use it to just enrich
[1:22:45] yourself and to gratify yourself down
[1:22:48] even to you know the money you were
[1:22:51] given the money that came on your bank
[1:22:53] account brother
[1:22:56] do you use it you know when we were
[1:22:58] collecting money for buying
[1:23:01] the to do this and that you had money
[1:23:05] and you holded
[1:23:06] it and you Ed it for your other
[1:23:09] things you know all those things you
[1:23:12] know the angel of the Lord will follow
[1:23:13] it
[1:23:15] up you know down to how you spoke to
[1:23:17] your
[1:23:19] brother how you spoke to your
[1:23:21] sister how you didn't like someone very
[1:23:24] much
[1:23:27] even when they apolog to you reped to
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:31] you you still that thing in
[1:23:36] your will follow
[1:23:39] that everything we do matters before the
[1:23:41] presence
[1:23:43] of everything we do will come to
[1:23:47] judgment and we shall all be
[1:23:51] judged judgment seat of Christ
[1:23:55] that judgment will not be judgment unto
[1:24:01] condemnation no it will not be judgment
[1:24:04] to either give life or deny
[1:24:09] life everyone that will be on that
[1:24:12] Jud will already have
[1:24:15] life so you see the Believers are the
[1:24:18] ones who will be
[1:24:20] judged so to be judged for what Beed
[1:24:26] into
[1:24:29] glories their life on
[1:24:31] Earth we are all not going to have the
[1:24:34] same
[1:24:36] Glory the Bible says he has vessels in
[1:24:39] his
[1:24:41] house
[1:24:43] of of less
[1:24:45] H all
[1:24:47] his even in heaven even in the rapture
[1:24:51] we will all not be having the same Glory
[1:24:56] have different levels of
[1:24:59] Glory depending on what
[1:25:03] we depending on how
[1:25:10] we when he talked of a
[1:25:12] Preacher when he reached Heaven he
[1:25:15] noticed there were
[1:25:16] crown and everybody was taking their
[1:25:19] Crown so he went for the big
[1:25:22] Crown the big shining crown
[1:25:25] told this is not
[1:25:27] yours have been a
[1:25:30] power turned many
[1:25:33] God many Souls I've had many
[1:25:37] crusades have healed a sick he said yeah
[1:25:40] that's all true but that is
[1:25:43] yours he took the little B
[1:25:46] one and it was what could fit on
[1:25:49] his he couldn't understand it and then
[1:25:53] the angel of the Lord showed
[1:25:55] said I want you to see
[1:25:57] something then there came a very old
[1:26:00] woman who was old at that
[1:26:04] time the Church of that
[1:26:06] man and this is the woman that would
[1:26:09] take the big
[1:26:11] Crown the man was confused how possible
[1:26:16] he said because every one of those
[1:26:19] exploits talking
[1:26:22] about it was because of the prayers of
[1:26:26] that she used to pray for you every
[1:26:30] day when you were
[1:26:32] on you were
[1:26:34] winning because of her
[1:26:37] prayers the things you accomplish in
[1:26:40] the because of the prayers of that
[1:26:43] woman you see now her judgment
[1:26:48] was was that she would take the bigger
[1:26:51] Shining
[1:26:55] not the preacher so the things you do
[1:26:58] matter before
[1:27:00] God you see at this moment not the
[1:27:03] debate or the
[1:27:06] conversation our conversation now is not
[1:27:09] about whether we shall make you to the
[1:27:10] Rapture or
[1:27:13] not that is not the
[1:27:15] conversation as long as you are a
[1:27:17] Believer as long as you have received
[1:27:19] the Holy Spirit it is a must for you to
[1:27:23] go to the
[1:27:26] here is what Glory will you
[1:27:31] have the Bible also speaks about those
[1:27:35] who will turn men to
[1:27:38] righte they will have a lot of shining
[1:27:41] stars in
[1:27:43] their so you see the glories will be
[1:27:47] different just like you see in the
[1:27:50] church our glories are different
[1:27:58] another all
[1:28:01] God someone sweeps the
[1:28:03] church you know someone speaks to the
[1:28:06] people another one plays the
[1:28:10] music what Glory do you want to have
[1:28:12] when
[1:28:13] you I don't know about you but I want to
[1:28:17] be closest to
[1:28:18] the I want to have a bigger shining
[1:28:22] CL there is anything we should fight
[1:28:25] for is that bigger shining
[1:28:28] Crown we are not looking how much Glory
[1:28:32] we shall receive on
[1:28:35] us amen pay attention to what I'm saying
[1:28:38] please many people when they do
[1:28:40] something for
[1:28:42] God looking for
[1:28:44] Glory you know I am the one who did that
[1:28:47] I am the one who did that the one who
[1:28:50] did that even you see brother
[1:28:54] one who gave him that
[1:28:55] nectar I am the one who bought him those
[1:28:58] shoes is actually without me is
[1:29:01] nothing you see I've taken all the
[1:29:04] glory and you know the brother is
[1:29:06] feeling
[1:29:07] small but let me tell you friend of
[1:29:10] course I didn't buy those things for you
[1:29:12] praise the name of the Lord but even if
[1:29:14] I did I want the glory to be up
[1:29:18] there whatever you are doing for the
[1:29:20] Lord you may not be thanked
[1:29:24] like sister she never spoken
[1:29:27] about you know many times she takes
[1:29:29] these
[1:29:31] curtains and you know makes them
[1:29:33] beautiful puts them back
[1:29:36] up never paid never talked about her
[1:29:40] glories will be
[1:29:42] found you may be the person will see the
[1:29:45] flowers D and will take it upon yourself
[1:29:49] says I want to be the
[1:29:51] one take care of all the flowers
[1:29:57] I want to be the one you may never be
[1:30:00] paid but you consist do
[1:30:03] it every day every week every week and
[1:30:08] when you get over there your glories
[1:30:10] will
[1:30:11] be our glory is in heaven we are working
[1:30:15] for to attain That
[1:30:17] Glory our payment is in
[1:30:19] heaven praise the name of the Lord
[1:30:22] praise the name of the Lord but now I
[1:30:24] want us to see there is also what we
[1:30:27] call the white Throne
[1:30:31] judgment and the white Throne judgment
[1:30:34] will also consist of
[1:30:37] those that will get
[1:30:40] life having not previously attained
[1:30:45] it okay but now those who have or going
[1:30:52] Rapture they Attain life before they go
[1:30:55] in the
[1:30:58] rapt are you hearing me if you're
[1:30:59] hearing me say
[1:31:01] Amen they attain life before they go
[1:31:05] int how do they attain
[1:31:08] life there is only one sour of Life
[1:31:12] remember that
[1:31:14] is God own
[1:31:17] life someone one time told me oh some
[1:31:20] people will go in Hell Fire
[1:31:24] burn
[1:31:25] forever for eternity but you see a
[1:31:28] prophet teaches us there won't be an
[1:31:33] eternal tell your neighbor there is
[1:31:37] noal if there is
[1:31:40] etal it means they are also having some
[1:31:42] source of eternal
[1:31:46] life but those who go to hell would have
[1:31:49] been denied
[1:31:52] life so they will go to hell because
[1:31:56] they don't have eternal
[1:31:58] life and after they go to hell they burn
[1:32:01] forever and
[1:32:05] ever I want you to remember one
[1:32:08] thing everything that was
[1:32:11] created will have an
[1:32:14] end hell was
[1:32:17] created hell will have an
[1:32:20] end they may burn for zillions of years
[1:32:27] they will burn for a very long time but
[1:32:31] you see at the end of it
[1:32:32] all will do away with
[1:32:35] hell because those who have eternal
[1:32:39] life not go to hell only one source of
[1:32:43] eternal
[1:32:44] life Jesus the son in that office you
[1:32:49] know the Bible says that he will have an
[1:32:52] end and you hear the people who believe
[1:32:55] the
[1:32:56] Trinity they teach Jesus as the Eternal
[1:33:00] Son of
[1:33:03] God the Son of God had a
[1:33:06] beginning in terms of
[1:33:12] his had a beginning will surely have an
[1:33:16] End Amen when he has put all enemies
[1:33:19] under his
[1:33:21] feet he himself
[1:33:24] subject to the
[1:33:27] father become subject to the
[1:33:32] father become subject to the father like
[1:33:35] when when you subject to someone it
[1:33:37] means you are under them and they over
[1:33:41] you all right yeah that's that's a good
[1:33:44] interpretation so now we see that we are
[1:33:47] not going to have an eternal
[1:33:51] son there is only one source of
[1:33:55] etal that SCE of eternal life is
[1:33:59] God Eternal
[1:34:01] God the Eternal life and he gives it to
[1:34:06] as many that will
[1:34:09] believe my you know this is a big
[1:34:13] thought and if you can be able to move
[1:34:16] with
[1:34:17] me avoid
[1:34:19] distraction stick in the
[1:34:22] service listen to
[1:34:24] everyone while you're filtering it in
[1:34:26] your
[1:34:27] spirit I'm sure this will be a blessing
[1:34:30] to praise the name of the Lord and also
[1:34:33] pray for my
[1:34:35] interpreter
[1:34:36] amen all right so I want you to follow
[1:34:39] closely you see that this
[1:34:42] life is the life of
[1:34:45] God this life does not
[1:34:48] end and all those who will get
[1:34:51] life will also be a
[1:34:55] ET like God they will never come to an
[1:35:01] end how do we get eternal
[1:35:04] life we only get eternal life by
[1:35:09] faith neighbor we get eternal life
[1:35:14] by not by
[1:35:18] works did somebody get it not by work
[1:35:24] I
[1:35:25] realize many even in the
[1:35:28] message preach the message of
[1:35:32] Works our message is not the message of
[1:35:37] work it is the message of faith and
[1:35:41] Grace and I want you to understand the
[1:35:44] prophet said Grace not
[1:35:49] disgrace because you see this grace
[1:35:53] when having attained
[1:35:57] Grace but you are not able to walk
[1:35:59] within the Realms of that
[1:36:04] Grace I want us to understand what is
[1:36:09] Grace Grace is unmerited
[1:36:17] favorited but it is given
[1:36:20] to you we were all born in sin
[1:36:24] we were born without etal
[1:36:26] life but God are you following because
[1:36:30] of his
[1:36:32] love we read that last Sunday so
[1:36:44] Lov let us start over again for God so
[1:36:48] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:36:52] begotten son that
[1:36:54] whosoever believeth on him should not

[1:37:29] doing why when he gave
[1:37:32] Christ Jesus Christ came down on
[1:37:35] Earth he came to
[1:37:38] purchase life eternal life all the backl
[1:37:46] sons of God and the price he
[1:37:51] paid them
[1:37:53] and redeemed them back into their
[1:37:57] original
[1:37:59] position they were now in the hands
[1:38:02] of but he came and presented the
[1:38:06] payment and he said here is the
[1:38:09] payment these are
[1:38:12] redeemed Satan cannot keep
[1:38:16] them you cannot hold
[1:38:18] them set them free and you know when he
[1:38:22] died he began with a
[1:38:26] thief Hallelujah the thief was
[1:38:30] purchased hallelujah amen amen amen and
[1:38:33] then straight away he went down into
[1:38:37] hell and he found all
[1:38:39] those were kept

[1:39:04] eternal
[1:39:06] life and he open for them and from that
[1:39:09] time everyone who received eternal
[1:39:13] life not die and go to
[1:39:16] hell die and go to
[1:39:19] heaven in a place in a dimension amen of
[1:39:25] paradise where all those who died in
[1:39:30] Christ and the Bible says how will the
[1:39:33] Rapture
[1:39:34] be all those who are dead in
[1:39:37] Christ all those who have ET
[1:39:41] before they shall resurrect they will
[1:39:44] come out of that
[1:39:45] Dimension
[1:39:47] physically they will come here and pick
[1:39:50] up their
[1:39:51] bodies we shall see
[1:39:54] and then shortly before we will also be
[1:39:58] changed be changed meaning we shall put
[1:40:01] off these
[1:40:03] bodies and we will wear our
[1:40:08] bodies that cannot
[1:40:11] die that disapp
[1:40:14] and I am waiting for
[1:40:16] that and then we meet them and together
[1:40:20] we will be raptured away and we go in
[1:40:23] heaven to the marriage supper of the

[2:00:07] shall be saved and that man became a
[2:00:11] Believer he said I believe and because
[2:00:14] he believed he was
[2:00:16] baptized that same night because he
[2:00:20] believed he washed
[2:00:24] strips because he believed that he did
[2:00:27] many things to show he had believed the
[2:00:32] things we do we do them because we are
[2:00:36] believers the things we do are not the
[2:00:38] one that save us we do what we do
[2:00:42] because we are who we
[2:00:44] are can you shout

[2:01:12] making you a
[2:01:13] Believer we baptize you because you are
[2:01:17] a
[2:01:20] Believer go the world preach the
[2:01:23] gospel he that
[2:01:25] what he that
[2:01:28] believeth
[2:01:30] is shall

[2:01:35] unbelievers we baptize
[2:01:38] Believers we
[2:01:40] Believers are you
[2:01:43] Believers so because you are
[2:01:45] believers we are
[2:01:48] baptized in water in the name of our
[2:01:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:52] that doesn't save
[2:01:54] us what saves us is our
[2:01:58] faith in
[2:02:00] him there are some people who will go
[2:02:04] and receive eternal
[2:02:07] life having just beli not
[2:02:15] baptized are you still
[2:02:18] here that one is hard for you to say
[2:02:20] Amen
[2:02:22] it is possible to go to heaven without
[2:02:25] being
[2:02:26] baptized if you had
[2:02:28] believed I'm emphasizing Faith

[2:02:47] baptized you are walking in your answer
[2:02:49] right
[2:02:52] if you say baptism is the only thing
[2:02:56] that makes someone a
[2:02:58] believer that man was not
[2:03:02] aie Brethren baptism is done by
[2:03:08] Believers baptism does not make
[2:03:13] Believers you do it because you are a
[2:03:17] Believer are you following the thief on
[2:03:20] the cross received eternal life because
[2:03:24] of his faith but he didn't have a chance
[2:03:27] to be baptized but if he had gone out of
[2:03:30] that
[2:03:30] cross you would have been
[2:03:33] baptized if you refuse baptism it means
[2:03:37] you not a
[2:03:38] Believer as as
[2:03:41] that in Acts chapter
[2:03:44] 19 praise God no not 19 another chapter
[2:03:48] where Peter meets Cor
[2:03:52] when he met them and these people
[2:03:55] believed and received the Holy Ghost
[2:03:58] while Peter was still preaching then he
[2:04:03] said because Peter was
[2:04:06] doubting Gentiles could
[2:04:10] believe he thought only Jews were the
[2:04:12] only ones to
[2:04:15] believe but he was shocked when he saw
[2:04:20] the Gentiles
[2:04:22] had also believed and even spoken in he
[2:04:25] was shocked he wanted to prove where he
[2:04:28] was and that's the only place in the
[2:04:30] scripture where you find a preacher
[2:04:33] asking someone to be
[2:04:35] baptized all the other places it was the
[2:04:38] believer asking
[2:04:41] to but here Peter tells them all right
[2:04:47] seeing that you have received the Holy
[2:04:48] Ghost like us
[2:04:51] put it to our test come I bapti you they
[2:04:55] didn't run
[2:04:56] away but they said we are they were in
[2:05:00] their T hallelujah hallu huj hallelujah
[2:05:03] hallelujah hallelujah come to the
[2:05:06] water they didn't say no leave us we are
[2:05:09] in the spirit BM
[2:05:12] again they did not refuse it they
[2:05:16] accepted a True Believer will believe
[2:05:19] and accept every
[2:05:23] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:05:25] hallelujah whether you feel like it or
[2:05:28] you don't whether agrees with you or it
[2:05:31] doesn't if you're a Believer you will
[2:05:33] agree with every
[2:05:37] word amen and eternal life is received
[2:05:42] on the basis of
[2:05:45] faith in the finished work of the
[2:05:49] Cross now that
[2:05:52] is for those who will receive the
[2:05:57] Rapture you have heard many people
[2:06:01] saying it doesn't matter what I
[2:06:04] do it matters what is on my
[2:06:08] heart and they after that they do every
[2:06:11] bad thing and these are the people who
[2:06:14] who are going to go on the white
[2:06:17] thr but that those words are for
[2:06:20] believers
[2:06:22] we are the ones who are supposed to say
[2:06:24] it doesn't matter what I
[2:06:27] do it matters what he did for
[2:06:30] me because after that the life anyhow
[2:06:36] will be the life of a
[2:06:40] lamb do you think it's you doing it do
[2:06:43] you think you can do righteousness H
[2:06:46] that will accept go that will make God
[2:06:48] accept no the Bible says our
[2:06:51] righteousness
[2:06:52] like filthy
[2:06:54] RS God can't be impressed by
[2:06:58] it but there something that impresses
[2:07:00] you when you accept and believe submit
[2:07:05] yourself to his
[2:07:07] word and then he will let his Spirit
[2:07:10] come in your
[2:07:11] life and that life will live the life
[2:07:20] of singing sing with me sister the

[2:09:05] Spirit and when he comes in your
[2:09:08] life whatever he says you will

[2:15:07] prophet says he said behold I send the
[2:15:08] promise of the father upon
[2:15:13] you carry ye always the city of
[2:15:17] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[2:15:19] from
[2:15:21] to show that not only did he draw all
[2:15:23] the benefits out of
[2:15:28] it but he shared it with those he shared
[2:15:32] those
[2:15:37] benefits there are
[2:15:39] benefits of eternal
[2:15:42] life been received by
[2:15:46] faith listen the people who receive
[2:15:48] eternal life
[2:15:52] do not receive it by
[2:15:55] faith so there's no other
[2:15:59] benefits do you know what it
[2:16:02] means to receive or be employed with a
[2:16:06] job with a
[2:16:08] salary and
[2:16:13] benefits ask brother Andre you
[2:16:17] know
[2:16:19] salary and benefits
[2:16:24] salary and
[2:16:26] benefits eternal life and
[2:16:29] benefits so those are there also who can
[2:16:33] get
[2:16:34] salary no
[2:16:36] benefits but the bride receives eternal
[2:16:40] life and the
[2:16:43] benefits now those
[2:16:45] benefits were not only shared by
[2:16:49] Christ but shared did with
[2:16:53] us he came to
[2:16:56] redeem to bring to life those those
[2:16:59] predestinated
[2:17:03] SE that God seen before the foundation
[2:17:06] of the
[2:17:08] world and he put their
[2:17:11] names in The Book of
[2:17:15] Life and here they be on
[2:17:18] earth without a hope
[2:17:21] he came not only to be the
[2:17:24] blessing but to share the
[2:17:28] blessing with every
[2:17:30] [Music]
[2:17:37] predestin he did not come to share the
[2:17:41] blessing no he did not come to be the
[2:17:46] blessing but he came to share the
[2:17:48] blessing with us
[2:17:52] we had the predestin
[2:17:55] seed and he came to share the blessing
[2:17:57] with
[2:18:00] us now if the seed wasn't on
[2:18:04] us it could not
[2:18:07] leave it had to be on the
[2:18:10] earth and also
[2:18:16] dramatized Hallelujah that is why you
[2:18:19] were born by your mother and father
[2:18:22] you are not here by
[2:18:24] mistake you are not on Earth by
[2:18:28] accident you are here to share the
[2:18:31] blessing if you were not born you could
[2:18:35] not but you had to be
[2:18:41] born no matter how long that seed is
[2:18:44] kept in
[2:18:47] darkness it will come forth when the sun
[2:18:52] shines upon
[2:18:56] it what I read he sent son o
[2:19:11] n
[2:19:13] yes you see when you plant a
[2:19:16] seed in darkness it will not grow
[2:19:21] seed we common science
[2:19:23] right seed needs how many
[2:19:27] things sunlight
[2:19:32] water and moisture whatever I don't know
[2:19:36] now but the most important thing is Son
[2:19:41] and now he said this
[2:19:45] seat everybody said this
[2:19:48] seat was planted down here on Earth
[2:19:51] but when it came listen now when it came
[2:19:53] down it was buried in the
[2:19:56] soil of
[2:19:59] darkness in the world under the rulers
[2:20:02] of the powers
[2:20:05] of doing all the wicked things like all
[2:20:07] the
[2:20:08] other Paul even said however he said
[2:20:11] that we were also like
[2:20:14] them but he has redeemed us so now we
[2:20:18] wear that seed
[2:20:20] that Darkness but when he came who the
[2:20:27] son you can say son s
[2:20:36] n my God I'm just intoxicated here with
[2:20:39] this Revelation now listen
[2:20:42] here the son as you n
[2:20:47] light when it shines on the seat
[2:20:52] the seed is
[2:20:54] dramatized now when the Sun s o
[2:21:00] n yes when he
[2:21:03] Shin what did he do he came to
[2:21:08] dramatize the seed that were
[2:21:12] predestinated to also come to
[2:21:17] life I wanted to look it over in John
[2:21:22] praise the name of the
[2:21:26] Lord chapter one I believe it
[2:21:32] is vers
[2:21:36] um six there was a man sent from God
[2:21:41] whose name was
[2:21:44] John the same came for a
[2:21:47] witness to Bear witness of the light
[2:21:53] am the light come in the
[2:21:57] world Jo to the world the light is
[2:22:02] coming they say the light of the
[2:22:05] Sun the
[2:22:07] light the sun
[2:22:12] same let Earth receive her
[2:22:18] King there was a man sent from from God
[2:22:21] whose name was John he came to bear
[2:22:23] witness of the
[2:22:27] light that all
[2:22:30] men through him might
[2:22:33] believe he oh
[2:22:35] Hallelujah believing can now
[2:22:39] come it can now come when the light
[2:22:43] has he was not John was not the
[2:22:47] light but he was sent
[2:22:50] to Bear witness of the
[2:22:53] life John the
[2:22:55] Baptist was a messenger he was
[2:23:01] Elijah William Bram was a messenger he
[2:23:05] was
[2:23:07] Elijah William Bram was not the
[2:23:11] light but William Bram was sent from God
[2:23:16] to Bear witness of the life
[2:23:25] that was the True
[2:23:28] Light which lights every
[2:23:32] man that cometh into the
[2:23:36] world he was in the
[2:23:39] world and the world was made by
[2:23:43] him and the world knew
[2:23:47] him it was him in the beginning who said
[2:23:51] let there be
[2:23:54] light and now it was him here who came
[2:23:58] again in the
[2:23:59] world he was the
[2:24:02] light the light came from
[2:24:04] him so he was the
[2:24:07] light and he came in the world but the
[2:24:11] people love the
[2:24:13] darkness more than the
[2:24:15] light he came unto his own and his own
[2:24:19] received him
[2:24:21] but as many has received him to them
[2:24:26] gave him power to become the sons of God
[2:24:30] even to them that believe on his
[2:24:35] name not to them that do this and this
[2:24:37] and
[2:24:38] this to them that
[2:24:41] believe he has given
[2:24:43] power Hallelujah in our generation he
[2:24:47] has sent us a prophet messenger with
[2:24:50] message of
[2:24:52] restoration back to the Bible back to
[2:24:55] the foundations amen the messenger was
[2:24:58] not the
[2:24:59] light but the messenger was a witness of
[2:25:04] the light we don't follow
[2:25:06] William we follow Jesus
[2:25:11] Christ William Bram was a star that La
[2:25:15] us that showed us Jesus Christ
[2:25:21] and by following him F that star we
[2:25:25] found Christ and when we find Christ we
[2:25:29] are right here with him he's the light
[2:25:31] of the
[2:25:33] world all ye Saints of light

[2:26:15] of the
[2:26:16] life and William's message actually
[2:26:20] it has presented to us
[2:26:22] Christ and now this Christ whoever

[2:27:30] around
[2:27:35] us The ecumenical move of the tears is
[2:27:42] frur but also it is a
[2:27:46] fact that the prophet of the last age
[2:27:48] must be bringing forth a message from
[2:27:52] God that will for the second coming of
[2:27:55] the

[3:15:37] we before before before the People March
[3:15:41] out
[3:15:42] please um
[3:15:50] we we've just
[3:15:52] concluded uh brother aa's
[3:15:56] wedding you're supposed to be
[3:15:57] interpreting for
[3:16:03] me that microphone I think you to switch
[3:16:05] it on
[3:16:13] [Music]
[3:16:20] and I appreciate people who accept to
[3:16:23] obey the Holy Spirit when he
[3:16:28] speaks I love people who submit
[3:16:31] themselves to the Holy
[3:16:34] Spirit when he
[3:16:36] speaks
[3:16:38] so God spoke to brother
[3:16:42] Andrew to remind me of something very
[3:16:45] important
[3:16:48] you know when when we are in the
[3:16:50] presence of
[3:16:52] God everything like is all in
[3:16:56] order she makes no
[3:16:59] mistakes
[3:17:00] amen so wanted us to be reminded about
[3:17:04] sister pe's
[3:17:10] wedding um first of all I'd like to
[3:17:15] appreciate those who Isaac and
[3:17:20] charity being with young people have
[3:17:25] learned
[3:17:27] um when someone does
[3:17:30] something before another does
[3:17:35] it the one who has not yet
[3:17:38] done will see a lot of loop
[3:17:41] holes and mistakes and
[3:17:44] errors in what the other has
[3:17:48] done and will think me I'll be much
[3:17:54] better but I believe that's what even
[3:17:57] the Holy Spirit was trying to speak to
[3:17:58] us
[3:18:00] today we should humble
[3:18:04] ourselves and we should love one another
[3:18:07] support one
[3:18:10] another do we understand what I'm
[3:18:13] saying brother Andrew did his wedding
[3:18:17] some supported some did
[3:18:20] not shame same
[3:18:23] thing now
[3:18:25] Isa and now it is
[3:18:27] peace but the trend that I
[3:18:31] see regardless of what anybody
[3:18:39] says what there is one Trend that I have
[3:18:42] seen that God has been with us in all
[3:18:45] those weddings
[3:18:48] [Applause]
[3:18:53] some attended this wedding and some did
[3:18:55] not attend the other
[3:18:58] wedding but God attended
[3:19:01] all and as your pastor I can tell you
[3:19:05] God has been behind all those
[3:19:07] [Music]
[3:19:09] marriages regardless of your
[3:19:12] opinion or person
[3:19:15] opinion God is God is God by himself he
[3:19:20] does what he wants to do and no man
[3:19:22] there questions
[3:19:24] him and so at this
[3:19:27] time the next wedding is that of sister
[3:19:31] peace uh the wedding is is it 31st
[3:19:37] August and unless they changed but the
[3:19:40] last conversations we had was it's going
[3:19:42] to happen in
[3:19:51] uh so that
[3:19:53] means is one of
[3:19:56] us of course we have to stand with
[3:19:59] behind as we have stood with all the
[3:20:03] brothers uh we've been taking people's
[3:20:09] girls it is now time for us to give
[3:20:12] also and we have to do it with one heart
[3:20:18] amen so I I think I would like maybe the
[3:20:22] deacons will work on that together with
[3:20:25] a piece and a
[3:20:29] fiance so that we try to
[3:20:32] arrange uh on that day you know a
[3:20:38] car uh that will take as many you can
[3:20:40] find a car and find out how much it will
[3:20:43] cost
[3:20:46] next Sunday you can
[3:20:48] announce so that people who want to go
[3:20:51] can be bringing each the amount can be
[3:20:59] divided if 200,000 and there 14 people
[3:21:02] how much is
[3:21:10] that 14
[3:21:18] you you're
[3:21:19] offline he has been interpreting so it's
[3:21:22] offline someone who is good in
[3:21:26] math
[3:21:29] 15 so you see if we using a taxi I'm
[3:21:33] just saying if it is 200,000 I don't
[3:21:35] know how much it is so but I believe you
[3:21:39] can begin preparing at least a minimum
[3:21:41] of
[3:21:43] 50,000 to go and come 60 70 around there
[3:21:48] to go and come
[3:21:50] back so plan around
[3:21:52] 70,000 plan it it is next month around
[3:21:55] the end of next
[3:21:57] month yeah and then they will inform us
[3:21:59] the exact amount
[3:22:01] later so we go and support
[3:22:03] sisterpie number number two they still
[3:22:06] need

[3:22:32] wedding and when you do that you will
