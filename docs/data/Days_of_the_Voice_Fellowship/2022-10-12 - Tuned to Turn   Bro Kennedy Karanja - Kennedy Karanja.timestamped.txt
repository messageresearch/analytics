[12:18] short time today
[12:19] [Music]
[12:20] we just want to put some emphasis on the
[12:24] world
[12:26] because that is what propels us to go to
[12:30] that land where we can sing forever
[12:36] it is okay for us to sing here
[12:40] and we should sing and sing and sing and
[12:42] sing

[12:47] us there
[12:48] foreign
[12:49] [Music]
[13:10] [Music]
[14:00] [Music]

[14:51] So speaking in the physical point of
[14:55] view category
[14:57] I am happy to be associated with you
[15:00] today
[15:03] but most importantly
[15:06] to be associated with the one God
[15:14] chapter 4.
[15:18] we will also pick a portion from The
[15:20] Book of Proverbs but we shall see it as
[15:22] we continue
[15:25] just for the short time that we shall be
[15:27] here
[15:29] I believe that the Lord is going to
[15:31] speak to us
[15:33] trusting that you have prayed up
[15:36] I solicit your prayers as well
[15:41] let us read in the name of our Lord
[15:43] Jesus
[15:45] in The Book of Malachi chapter 4 this
[15:47] this is uh this will be I believe us and
[15:50] them
[15:54] you know there are things
[16:04] [Music]
[16:39] foreign all right you're here
[16:45] that is the spirit of football and all
[16:47] those kind of things
[16:49] if there is a lineup we should know
[16:52] where two Bankers
[17:02] because these are the things that we
[17:04] identify with
[17:07] let us get in the spirit today
[17:10] I am not bringing anything new this is
[17:21] and most importantly
[17:24] this message of Grace that we've
[17:26] received in this house
[17:33] I will send you Elijah the prophet
[17:36] before the coming of the great and
[17:38] Dreadful day of the Lord
[17:39] and he shall turn the heart of the
[17:42] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[17:45] the children to their fathers lest I
[17:48] come and smite the Earth with a curse is
[18:14] foreign
[18:18] [Music]
[19:15] may you restore those that need
[19:18] restoration
[19:20] reignite the fire of the Holy Ghost in
[19:22] those that has gone to him foreign
[19:27] [Music]
[20:14] uh the rest of the days we shall
[20:16] continue
[20:18] but just to sort of play a foundation
[20:22] I'll be speaking about
[20:25] I'll be speaking about tuned
[20:39] let us read in the Book of Proverbs 17
[20:41] verse 6.
[20:48] it is here
[20:50] children's children are the crown of old
[20:54] men
[20:55] and the glory of children are their
[20:58] fathers
[21:03] [Music]
[21:11] catch those words
[21:17] are the crown of old men
[21:20] in this place it is speaking about
[21:22] grandchildren
[21:25] these grandchildren
[21:27] they are crowns to their grandfathers
[21:34] and we all know the relationship between
[21:36] our grandfather and the grandchildren
[21:38] yeah
[21:45] is the father of the mother about to
[21:49] spank the child
[21:52] they're usually like no no no no no
[21:57] I I believe I'm speaking I'm not
[22:00] speaking something strange
[22:02] this is something that this is something
[22:04] that is real yeah
[22:07] you know it is because these
[22:10] grandchildren yes
[22:17] it really it really they have a certain
[22:20] connection
[22:22] and it is
[22:27] you cannot get a crown
[22:31] out of nothing
[22:34] so this grant this grandparents
[22:38] they raised their children
[22:41] and I want to believe they raised them
[22:44] right
[22:45] so when the grandchildren come on
[22:49] there's some more enjoying to see the
[22:53] work they did in their children
[22:58] and that is why we see here
[23:01] and the glory of the children and
[23:06] [Music]
[23:07] foreign
[24:10] Allah because they are very strong words
[24:12] here
[24:14] that the glory of the children
[24:17] are their fathers favorite someone the
[24:20] Bible tells us that a good man is he who
[24:25] lives an inheritance for his children
[24:28] so the glory of the children
[24:31] is their father I want you to look at
[24:35] the normal world today
[24:38] a child that has grown in a stable
[24:41] family I would say um
[24:46] there is a certain security that this
[24:49] child has
[24:51] the certain confidence that this child
[24:54] has
[24:56] and I believe that is what the Bible is
[24:58] the glory of the children
[25:03] these are children even as they are
[25:05] playing with other children
[25:06] [Music]
[25:08] they will go and tell their children
[25:15] you know my father has all the money
[25:19] what is happening
[25:21] the father is the glory of this child
[25:27] that is right you may not have anything
[25:30] but that is why it is so important
[25:34] especially to us as parents to realize
[25:38] that we are the people responsible for
[25:40] imparting Glory to our families
[25:45] because you see
[25:47] according to them
[25:50] according to these children
[25:53] is even more powerful
[25:56] than the president
[26:01] meet some children please
[26:11] for the glory of the children
[26:16] let us talk to the scripture because
[26:19] we've read in the Book of Malachi there
[26:22] is a promise
[26:29] but I want us to see something here
[26:32] anything to do with the children of God
[26:37] I want us to come up here
[26:42] I want us to come up here
[26:47] and about all these things
[26:49] I want you to put yourself in the
[26:52] scripture
[26:53] I want you to put yourself in the
[26:56] scripture
[26:57] because you want to get to a place
[27:01] we can see ourselves
[27:54] identification
[27:56] he says that when you fail to see
[27:59] yourself
[28:00] [Music]
[28:04] want to see ourselves in Proverbs today
[28:08] we want to see ourselves in Malachi
[28:11] chapter 4 today
[28:13] not tomorrow
[28:17] today
[28:18] because if you do not see yourself in
[28:20] the scripture today
[28:23] do not see yourself in the scripture
[28:25] every time you read the Bible
[28:28] oh brother sister then we are the most
[28:33] I don't know how to think
[28:35] you need we we need to be pretty oh well
[28:39] most of my Bible did not tell them we
[28:41] are the most beautiful people
[28:44] what was the purpose of sin that we
[28:46] received our message
[28:49] the whole Bible blame to us such a Bible
[28:52] you're not judges for you to see
[28:54] yourself in the Bible where on somebody
[28:57] else
[28:58] [Music]
[29:00] don't worry I'll be I'll be you know
[29:02] just moving from place to place I
[29:04] believe that it is important that these
[29:07] things can stick
[30:06] did not make it come to pass
[31:02] and the title of my sermon is like two
[31:05] sentences
[31:08] foreign
[31:52] yeah
[31:55] that was the message
[31:58] that was the message
[32:01] we might try to complicate it foreign
[32:33] we are no longer preaching Mysteries
[32:36] [Music]
[32:39] oh
[32:42] we are no longer preaching Mysteries
[32:45] because the greatest Mysteries
[32:54] when you find a preacher
[32:57] that is trying to make the Bible a
[33:00] mystery foreign
[33:17] foreign
[33:47] I don't know if you're catching somebody
[33:51] the fact that you believe this message
[33:53] and getting towards
[33:58] the fact that you believe this message
[34:13] you even come before Elijah if we were
[34:16] so Canadian
[34:19] Daddy
[34:24] there will not be no need for Elijah you
[34:27] want me but they won't wake up without
[34:29] Mary Mary
[34:31] the angel will not have come down
[34:41] so see yourself there cut the weight I
[34:43] mean Lord I will send you
[34:46] so you are that important to God
[34:50] [Music]
[34:53] Amina
[34:55] foreign
[35:26] I really love Bible language
[35:31] not hearts
[35:37] and he shall turn their hearts and then
[35:40] they choose all the fathers to the
[35:43] children
[35:45] and their hearts
[35:47] no mutima we know now the part A of the
[35:51] scriptures
[35:54] but this is our part now
[35:57] and the Heart of the children
[36:01] [Music]
[36:06] remember
[36:07] don't forget Proverbs
[36:10] the glory of the children is
[36:14] the glory of their children
[36:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[36:24] was to turn
[36:27] the heart
[36:29] of the children
[36:34] I want us to go it slowly
[36:38] because I believe there's some important
[36:40] things here that's
[36:45] I I really fear I really hear the
[36:49] ministry of teaching
[36:53] you can actually when the Bible itself
[36:55] warns against each other
[36:58] and teachers are the ones
[37:03] but I'm finding myself just going in
[37:05] that direction
[37:07] I believe it's for the benefit of
[37:09] someone somewhere
[37:12] I just pray that the Lord shall help me
[37:16] do not say anything wrong
[37:19] I believe there's a Ministry
[37:27] [Music]
[37:29] towards the building of the house of the
[37:31] Lord
[37:33] now we're talking about tuned
[37:38] students now I want to maybe just to
[37:42] break down the word a little bit to tune
[37:43] something
[37:45] is to make certain adjustments oh
[37:48] it is
[37:51] with a certain intention
[38:02] there is some tuning that has been done
[38:09] adjustments that have been made
[38:13] the purpose of the adjustments
[38:16] is that you may hear the sound
[38:20] through the musicians we have things
[38:24] like guitars
[38:26] that need to be tuned
[38:29] they have to be adjusted so they hit the
[38:33] right key right at the rights
[38:37] that is the meaning of the word
[38:43] opportunity that is to make an
[38:46] adjustments
[38:53] it means to move or change directions
[39:01] from one way to another Obama
[39:05] we are talking about tuned to town
[39:12] it is just a thought that the Lord
[39:14] placed on my heart
[39:17] because we've read about the Turning of
[39:20] the hearts
[39:27] Is Not Just Happening like that
[39:30] there is something that is going to
[39:33] happen
[39:43] and to enable them to come
[39:47] now we know our turning
[39:51] is not directionless
[40:01] foreign
[41:03] foreign
[41:15] ERS
[41:18] [Music]
[41:20] but fellow citizens with the Saints
[41:26] and of the household of God
[41:30] and are built upon the foundation of the
[41:34] Apostles and Prophets
[41:37] [Music]
[41:39] Jesus Christ himself
[41:46] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus so
[41:49] this is where
[41:51] this is where katiwano or rather this is
[41:54] a this is the foundation on which
[41:58] we are being built upon frequency I just
[42:02] want to also quote something
[42:04] in the church series
[42:14] I know these are things that we know
[42:17] but my desire is that today they shall
[42:19] just become a reality
[42:23] we can remind ourselves of these things
[42:30] [Music]
[42:37] according to Malachi 4.
[42:40] the hearts of the children to the
[42:42] fathers
[42:47] and we agree that we are the children
[42:51] not
[42:52] and we agree on that says
[42:55] and that their fathers are the apostles
[43:01] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[43:03] Thunder of the seven thunders
[43:08] in Revelation 10.
[43:10] which are the revelations contained in
[43:13] the Seven Seals
[43:18] it will be this divinely revealed
[43:22] Mrs
[43:27] that literally turned the heart of the
[43:31] children
[43:35] to the Pentecostals Amina
[43:42] so there's going to be a substance Kathy
[43:46] why do you not far away Chilli what will
[43:48] cause the tanning
[43:51] what is the substance
[43:55] divinely revealed
[43:57] mystery truth
[44:00] [Music]
[44:09] it is this divinely revealed mystery
[44:12] truth
[44:13] [Music]
[44:21] there is a reason why
[44:23] you could not stay with your trousers
[44:37] then what the throne
[44:41] I'm I'm failing to get one word
[44:52] yes because you are tuned
[45:01] in the wrong baptism that you are
[45:04] baptized
[45:05] because
[45:12] this divinely revealed mystery truth is
[45:21] amen hallelujah
[45:25] I'll catch this
[45:26] before we get to Malachi chapter 4 verse
[45:31] the Bible tells us up there
[45:34] to remember
[45:37] you know who that is
[45:46] [Music]
[45:55] Institute
[46:21] [Music]
[46:55] foreign
[47:32] [Music]
[47:37] is
[47:40] [Music]
[49:08] he will put them in
[49:10] foreign
[49:30] [Music]
[50:09] I will not be negligent to put you
[50:11] always in remembrance of these things
[50:15] [Music]
[50:26] up
[50:35] though you know them
[50:37] and be established in the present truth
[50:40] yeah
[50:43] I think it meets as long as I am in this
[50:47] Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you
[50:51] in remembrance
[50:59] so the problem
[51:02] that God had cartoon you can just read
[51:06] something in Deuteronomy chapter 10
[51:07] verse 16. now today
[51:13] money
[51:21] of your
[51:23] cut it is
[51:35] you know we all have ever seen someone
[51:38] who is

[53:39] foreign
[54:21] foreign
[54:56] foreign
[55:29] you can just maybe quickly
[55:32] who shall Ascend into the hill of the
[55:34] law
[55:37] or who shall stand in his holy place
[55:45] the presence of the Lord
[55:47] but the question is who is going to do
[55:50] that
[55:52] is he that have clean hands
[55:56] foreign
[56:14] strangers in a foreign
[56:56] that it is
[57:06] God is under had in the hearts of Faith
[57:12] he is not the one that hardened the
[57:14] heart of the Israelites
[57:19] the Israelites had a choice to make
[57:23] [Music]
[57:27] God hardened the heart of pharaoh
[57:31] God can have a chance to display his
[57:34] powerful
[57:36] and by displaying his power
[57:40] it was supposed to tune the hearts of
[57:43] the Israelites
[57:48] to remind the children of Israel
[57:52] about the promises of God
[57:57] when they are frogs in Egypt well why
[58:00] didn't they they tell them mystery when
[58:02] there is darkness is
[58:07] everything was okay foreign
[58:23] [Music]
[58:35] Amina

[58:39] together me who become victims of
[58:42] circumstances
[58:44] let us realize
[58:47] things are happening the area happening

[58:55] what does the Bible say when we see
[58:59] these things
[59:07] what is happening
[59:09] what killing you got to understand to
[59:12] realize again that you can operate
[59:16] the power of that fool no cause
[59:22] things are so expensive
[59:27] there's no hunger in the house
[59:33] not to call the pastor

[1:00:49] I know I am in the message
[1:00:55] when things are happening like that you
[1:00:57] said
[1:00:58] I have received my Elijah

[1:21:44] we don't have the time but we would have

[1:21:49] Jones
[1:22:00] when John the Baptist was preaching
[1:22:05] his work normal
[1:22:13] Jesus Christ Amina of Jesus Christ
[1:22:25] they had a certain privilege
