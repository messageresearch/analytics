may your sweet Spirit sweep over all of us there are great needs Lord in the midst of your people great burdens but when your spirit comes he lifts all the burdens away answers all the questions meets every situation may you do that for us tonight Lord as we turn to your holy word now in Jesus name amen amen God bless [Music] you uh how many enjoyed the Sunday service was a wonderful wonderful time amen and uh we just trust that the Lord will speak to us once again tonight so why don't we turn to our Bibles in the book of First Peter chapter 3 we are beginning to read from verses one and we shall read up to verse S likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be worn by the conversation of the [Music] wives while they behold your chest conversation coupled with fear who adoring let it not be the outward adorning of plating the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of [Music] apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and a quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great [Music] price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands for even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose short as ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being hairs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered amen you may be seated [Music] you can greet your neighbor and tell them God bless you welcome to the house of God Amen is the Lord good good to you so this evening I'm speaking on strength in weakness strength in weakness so we notice here Peter starts writing these things and is mainly speaking about the character of a woman um being saying that let their adorning not be the outward daing but we see that weing living in a generation or a time where the woman's strength is in is in her outside appearance I'm happy to see you sister Esther we prayed for you so that that her strength is on the outside uh looks the a typical woman in our generation would not dare go outside without without putting on makeup because her strength to her is in her makeup but you see the Bible speaks of a woman of character here and it says that her ading should not be the outward [Music] daing you see of plating the hair of wearing of gold of putting on of apparel and we know he is not saying that these are wrong is is not saying that if a woman plated her hair it's wrong or if a husband gave her necklace it's [Music] wrong oh that if she dressed good clothes it is wrong we know that that's what Paul is that's not what Paul is saying but Paul is saying that her Adon should go beyond [Music] this it should not be the outside things that everybody [Music] sees it should be the hidden man of the heart and I know that we are living in a time where ornaments women love ornaments you know you find them using ornaments all over well I've not never seen a Believer who uses earrings at least because we all know that earring is a sign or symbol of slav that's what in the Old Testament that's what they War when um they they were going to be a slave [Music] forever when the the trumpet of Jubilee sounded and they refused to be set free then they would be given a uh what you would call a an hearing they would be put on the door post and then they would hit their their ear with a hole and then put that ring [Music] there like you see a cow when it is tagged and the women today are tagged all over wherever you are going it's a sign that the devil has hold them hostage and that's why Believers don't go for those and so we find that the Bible says the ornament of a of a Believer should be the ornament of a me and acquired Spirit you will not you see the women are always after the things that of high value oh you know the boys out there or the men that marry them are really strained because they have to keep up with the with the with a with with the value to buy an expensive earring an expensive necklace an expensive nose Jewel and unexpensive fake eyelashes and and things and then makeup and all those things but you see the Bible says for this woman The Virtuous Woman her ornament will be of a Meek and AC quiet spirit that is why as much as Believers we know your husband can give you a necklace we really know that believers who are really Holy Ghost filled women that really seek after God time for for those things you know their time is really to seek after Holiness to seek after pleasing God their time their time is spent in in prayer in making their home in teaching their children praying for their husbands you see this is uh what a a virtuous woman does and you know the Bible continues on here to say after this manner in this way the all time in the old time the the holy women also who trusted in God they did like this this is how they adored themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord praise the name of the Lord I I'm just so thankful for this message of the hour that this message has liberated the men by setting free the women I'm so thankful that I can walk to a shop somewhere maybe to a jewelry shop Desiring to buy a ring for my wife and I'm so thankful for this message that our eyes will not be all over every jewelry in oh buy me this oh buy me that oh buy me this by the time they walks out she has several kilograms on her body you will find that even if the woman is rich as long as she has Christ in her heart those things will not take our heart and the Bible says the old women did the same way they Adorn themselves that way being in subjection to their own husbands now even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord now now we realize that in a marriage is not part ship the way we we think it is we are Partners that's not really the teaching of the Bible in marriage the man is the Lord and the woman is supposed to sub to submit to her Lord that's why sister you should not get married or you should not get married to a man you cannot submit to what is the kind of woman that you are going to marry the what kind of woman I'm talking to the woman what kind of man are you going to marry you're going to marry the kind of man that has the Lord Jesus as his headship if Jesus is is his head then he's not going to you are not going to submit to the devil but if Jesus is not the headship of the man you will never submit to Christ and that's why you should marry Believers all the time never marry an unbeliever because when that happens it breaks the entire chain I'm trying to build something here now if you can follow me so even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are amen sisters you are the daughters of Sarah as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving hon unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel everybody say we Vel weaker vessel weaker vessel oh the brothers love that part whenever we say sister is a weaker vessel think that she means it means that she's weak and she's good for nothing but today I want us to look at that I want us to see strength in this weakness amen and especially Brothers pay a lot of attention and sisters listen carefully the Bible says if a woman is in subjection to her husband if your husband does not believe the word that him without the word but because of your character because of your obedience and submission to the word it will win him to Jesus now in marriage the Woman's Place is submission the Woman's Place is submission the man's place is love and cherishing of the wife the woman must submit herself to her husband and the man must love his wife now if one of them lives their the whole marriage will be broken because if the woman do not submit the man will not and if the man does the woman will not submit so you see each of you have to stay in your place if you say your wife doesn't obey you your wife my wife doesn't submit to me there is a problem with you to begin with if you say oh my husband doesn't love me enough that means there's a problem to begin with you the the problem is right there because you see this is intertwined if you think the Lord Jesus does not love you there is a problem with your faith there is a problem with your submission but if you submit to every word of God he will love you with all the love amen and he loves you even unconditionally but if you submit to him you obey his word you do according to his ways you will always see his love and then on down we go I'd like us to see the symbol of submission praise God maybe if you want to help me with that uh 1 Corinthians [Music] 11:3 there is a foundation I'm trying to build so you can see something here listen but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God every man praying or prophesying having his head covered Dison his head but every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head for that is even all one as if she were sheven for if the woman be not covered let her also be shown but if it be ashame for a woman to be shown or seven let her covered did we all understand that part please listen carefully here he says if the he says every that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man [Music] so now and the head of Christ is God so in other words the head of the man is Christ the head of the woman is the man if you're following me say Amen every man praying or prophesying having his head covered this horn as his head understood that part no one a few of you if a man praise or prophesies having his head covered this hor as his head who is the head of the man Christ so if the man prays or prophesies meaning if a man worships God with his head covered with the physical head covered he's dishonoring Christ that's why we don't put hearts in church when we are praying men we remove our hearts that's why we also do not uh grow our hair long you will see it soon verse 5 but every woman that prays or prophesies with her head and covered dishonors her Len every woman that prays or prophesies her head her physical head covered she dis who if a woman prays or prophesies with her head uncovered meaning she has not covered her head she dishonors her head who is her head her husband so that means if a man if a woman prays or prophesies with her head uncovered she dishonors her husband are we all there now and then he continues on if she doesn't cover her head it is the same as if she should shave off everything if she doesn't come her head she should remove all the hair but then he says but if it is a shame for a woman to shave everything then she should cover her head so the question is what kind of covering is he talking about read verse 13 here now judge in yourselves is it comonly that a woman pray unto God un covered does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him praise God my sound today I don't understand it very well so listen he says judging yourself is it cly that a woman pray unto God uncovered is it good is it right for a woman to pray unto God uncovered does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a shame unto him if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a cover praise God so what does this imply the Bible has told us the woman if the woman prays with her head uncovered she's dishonoring her husband and then down here on verse 15 years told us her hair is her [Music] cover and then up there he had already said if she is uncovered let her shave everything what does that mean it means if the woman cuts her hair or if she trims her hair then it is better for her to wipe out everything but because it is a shame for a woman to to be baldheaded let her not cut her hair because her hair is given her for coverage in other words if a woman cuts her hair she dishonors her husband hair is a sign of submission hair is hair is a symbol of submission hair is a symbol of Glory Hair is a symbol of power somewhere there he said that you see she she has power on her head do you remember Samson the power was in his hair the woman has power on our head because of our hair can you imagine that why because hair is a sign of is a symbol of submission and I want to show you here there is power in submission as long as the woman stays in her place there is a power that she wields you know she is the glory to her husband what is the place of a woman in marriage submission what is the place of a man love and if the the woman stays in her place she has a lot of power let me tell you sister you can actually control your husband if you submit to him control him you have the power to control him if it's your god-given husband you don't need witchcraft to control you you have the power with you to a sword of power but you just need to realize it praise God praise God something I want you to see today now remember as we are speaking everything this is the type of the church let us first read John John 156 [Music] I hope you understood that Foundation because the foundation everything talk about if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they AB bur if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen hallelujah amen here is the spiritual application of what I just said if the bride is in her right place of [Applause] submission submission to every spoken word she has the power the Bible says Jesus himself said she can ask whatever she will she has the right to wield the the power a lot of power some power a lot of power there is power in submission as long as a woman submits herself to her husband in this case our husband is Jesus [Music] Christ please listen to me here now our husband is Jesus Christ and and and and and now Jesus himself our husband has said If any man abide in me and I abide in him he can ask for whatever he wants anything he wants he will have it what does that mean you cannot abide in Christ Christ unless you submit to him unless you obey every word unless you believe every word you have to do that in order for you to receive whatsoever you need if you are in your right place as a Christian if you are in your right place as a Believer whatever you desire am you have commanded it whatever the say whatsoever you desire ask and you shall receive how because you are in Christ if my people that are called by my name humble themselves and pray hear them you see so now the things that we desire it's not about Jesus doing them many things that we want him to do is in the power and control of the Bride he's waiting for you to come in your right place imagine sister if your husband tells you something and you don't obey him and then you tell him you know dear I need a new dress he'll just behave as if he'd never had I said I want a new dress he would just pass by I said I want a new dress and now you have become even a bad woman he will even not look at you at he will not hear you anymore but cook him some good food place the food on the table talk well to him talk nicely you know when he arrives at home create that atmosphere did you know that the power to build a home is in the woman's hand power is not in the man's hand is in the woman's hand listen church when you see women that are children that are spoiled in most cases it is their mother when you see good children who are good people appreciate the fathers but it is their mother even the words you speaking it's not because of your father it is not father tongue it is mother tongue the character you have is a is a is a transfer of the character of your mother the life the way of life you are living it came from your mother if you back a lot your mother was back a lot if you abuse your mother was abusing if you shout your mother was Shou if you're calm your mother was calm if you talk well your mother was that way so that character of a mother is always amen controlling the entire household and notti is here the woman has a certain power given to her but that power is not given us power that that power is engraved in weakness that strength is engraved in weakness by the woman amen submitting herself it seems as if she has come to a place of weakness but don't think it is a place of weakness place of power strength and Authority people see us following Jesus believeing everything the word says and they call us fools they call us holy rollers because we Shou in chch when the spirit comes upon us because we rejoice when the spirit comes upon us then they say we are fooled we have lost our mind but they don't know that is a position of power Str and Authority people even some some of them fear to cry in the church they fear to manifest emotion when they feel they're going to be emotional they try to control it come on come on don't be emotional let me tell you if you be like that oh you are not in a place of authority at all but brother sister if you can accept to be in a place of [Music] weakness crying many times is shown as a as a as somebody who is crying is is in a place of weakness and the one who is looking on is the one who is strong but brother sister strength is revealed in weakness strength is in weakness that person there who shattered who praying who crying is wielding a lot of strength that you don't even have an idea what it is you remember the woman called the the mother of Samuel she was just there at the altar praying crying and then when the priest came it looked as if the priest was the one who was strong and the woman was weak said what is wrong with you woman who told you to drink this ear hours and then you know he was a priest he was occupying an office the spirit of God Came Upon why what was that it was the power and the strength of the woman actually driving and controlling the priest when when the priest came he came with another attitude but when he arrived there the strength the woman had in her tears began controlling him and he that was saying why are you drunk why are you Dr it it was as if he was Bewitched what you want you shall have it God has given it to you where did those words come from it came from the tears of the woman strength is in weakness never never underestimate weakness whenever you are weak there is some strength somewhere there is strength that is why I want to make a statement there is nothing strong like a woman on earth a few amens because you have no revelation of what I'm talking about there is nothing strong on earth like a woman you you say Amen later on you will understand say Amen because you have understood you say Amen because you believe what I'm saying the woman is the strongest creature in the world praise the name of the Lord why because the Bible says she's a weaker vessel which means in her weakness she wields the power that controls the world look sin the devil could not bring sin without the woman not only that God could not bring Salvation without the woman so in other words the woman is on both ends she wields her strength she wields her power the man actually will listen to me the a man can never attain his potential his full potential to fulfill it without a woman that's why when God created everything he said it is good it's good it's good but when he saw the man he said it's not good it's not good why because a woman was missing the woman had to come in view for God to say it is good now listen now praise God Without You Christ is not complete he's the head but you are the body what is the head without the body it's nothing the head needs the body to function strength is in weakness I'm coming I'm coming to you I'm coming to you first Peter chapter 3 likewise he has dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel now the Bible calls a woman the weaker vessel meaning if the woman is the weaker vessel she must be placed in a place where she has an opportunity to wield a certain strength strength that no one else can wield brother the message a greater witness a greater witness he says and you and when you you being when you can become nothing in your own sight you are becoming something in God's s and always remember this friends the Way Up Is Down tell your neighbor the Way Up Is Down brother Solomon tell your neighbor the way up is down if you want to go up go down if you want to be strong you have to be weak you cannot be strong when you are strong you have to be weak in order to be strong if you are proud you will be brought down if you are humble you will be lifted up and always remember these friends the Way Up Is Down he that EXs himself shall be a best but he that Humes himself shall be exalted whenever God speaks to you you should humble yourselves the reason why people don't experience God because they are proud what is a proud heart he that doesn't believe he that believes he has everything he needs like says we are rich we increased with goods and we have need of nothing because they thought like that God said you don't know you are poor you are blind you are naked and you don't know it why because they think they are something God said you are nothing and I'm telling you church if you think you are something you are nothing before God but if you think you are nothing here to tell you you are going to be something before God he says just love him with all your heart and forget all you ever know about all other things but Jesus Christ just go ahead and love him and work for him serve him like the woman loves the husband works for the husband you know in the Book of Proverbs it speaks about a a woman a virtuous woman how she wakes up ear books for the house work for the house why because she's a servant she like a servant serve him why it's a place of weakness it seems if he wants you to be the door just be the door it's whatever he wants you to do you do it God will bless you what if God wants you to be a be a lose your identity and receive his identity Lose Yourself and receive him don't look at me as if you're not hearing what I'm saying say am Amen in John 15:5 I am Divine he said and you are the branches he that abides in me and I in him the same bring forth much but for without me you can do nothing think about that God is saying you I we can do nothing without you if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they AB bur without God you are nothing let me tell you whatever you want to accomplish life you can never accomplish anything without him what if you don't put God in your life you a loser Philippians 4:13 says I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me so in other words through him we can do all things without him we can do nothing so in other words he wants us to be to submit to him if we can submit to him there will be nothing impossible but without him we can accomplish nothing but with him there will be nothing impossible I am telling you even in your life if you can listen to the word we are preaching to you here every wedes every Friday every Sunday and you believe it and you do it there will be nothing impossible with you all things shall be made possible why because you have accepted to come to a place of weakness when you are in a place of weakness you are very strong you can do all things amen Amen Let Me Now give you a few examples now here in Luke 1: 38 Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from did you hear what Mary called herself made meaning a servant a nothing this is the Angel of the Lord Angel Gabriel when he came and he spoke to her the word of God Mary never doubted Mary submitted Mary listen submission does not mean agreement you know many times you know women think that they have to agree with their husband no submission does not mean agreement you may not understand what he's saying you may not even believe it you you can't make your mind agree to it but in your heart submit to it with all your heart you don't know how it can happen you don't know how it will be but you submit yourself you say you've said it I believe it that settles it that is submission now Mary when the angel came she was confused how will these things happen and and the angel told her the spirit of God will overshadow you and then Mary said the moment she heard let me ask you a question do you think that Mary knew how the spirit would overshadow did she have all answers she didn't have all answers but Mary believed and decided to submit now she was strong when she had her will but when she humbled herself his will she was no longer strong she was not vulnerable to his will be it unto me according to your word she was I'm the hand I'm I'm a handman I'm just as I'm nothing I'm just humbling myself here I don't know how it's going to be I don't I've never seen the spirit of a shadow anybody and they they become pregnant I've never seen how it happens I don't know how it is done all I know is you have said it and all I know is you are my Lord so I am saying let it be according to what you say and then she humbled herself that was submission did you realize that Mary at that time at that place she was put in a position of strength Mary accomplish something no man has ever [Music] accomplished now tell me who is greater than a woman in the world Mary accomplish something Mary brought forth the Messiah the Bible tells us to Mary says you are blessed among all women you are blessed the blessing of God it maketh rich and he adds no soul Mary was blessed that means that she was the richest woman ever why because she submitted herself to the word submission is power and because she submitted she brought forth the Messiah none else could do it but the but a woman under submission a man could not do it a man cannot do it a priest could not do it an angel could not do it I don't know whether you understand what I'm talking about no one could do it not even the angels of God not even the biggest priest or the biggest Prophet but a woman I imagine that why because God wanted to show that strength is in weakness and the savior of the world came through a woman not just a woman but a woman who was nothing and nobody despised from a despised town she didn't even have a place to go to bring forth him he he came in a a very despised way powerful things come small small but the problem with our generation we all want big things when we see Small Things We despise them we want big things and we want them fast so we we leave what would have taken us to Greatness and we rush for the big things which will evaporate like Vapor but here is Mary she was humble she was down there and then when when the angel of the Lord came you know the Angels Came among the Shepherds who are the Shepherds they were the weakest they were the most despised and and and the angels of God did not come to the [Music] Palace there is something I'm coming to if you want God to speak to you if you want angels of God to come to you if you want to receive the holy SP humble yourself come down submit yourself to the the Way Up Is Down and the Prest were just the Shepherds were just you know uh watching over ship at night and then the angel showed her and they began singing they began telling them the news he's born the savior of the world born why preached a message why it had to be sheer God is revealed in Simplicity not in great big things not in standers and aspect but in a still Small Voice and many people Miss God because they're waiting for him to speak in a thunder they're waiting him to roar like a lion God speaks in Simplicity you may have a problem right now in your life and you are here listening to me but in this Simplicity God may be giving you Solutions but you may miss it if you don't see God God works in Simplicity he doesn't work in great stands and great big things he works in simple ways that's how he was born in our generation he spoke to us through a seventh grader he didn't have a degree in theology brother Bram was very humble he he claimed to know nothing and then God made him speak things bring Revelations that you could not even find with a PhD holder what was that strength in weakness and I tell you a woman is a weaker vessel and because a woman is a weaker vessel all through centuries God has used women mightly in ways he has never used men before if you study your Bible you will Marvel I've just shown you one example here of Mary of Mary the angel did not come to to assist him there was a a church there was a high priest there were ministers there were other prophets but God byass all of them there were Kings God byass all of them there was even a high priest who believed God cannot speak in his time not through him he thought God will only speak through him so I believe they had rumors that the angel came to a certain woman and said that you will have a child and the spirit will overshadow you and when the high priest maybe heard that just ignore ignore if it is God Why didn't it speak to me listen if you are still proud if you still think you are somebody God can never speak to you God does not deal with pride God deals with humility God deals with a soft heart a broken Spirit a contrite heart soul God deals with [Music] such says he has left all the the big things of the world and he revealed himself to babes and he said the kingdom of God is likened unto a little child for God and angels to visit you you need to be helpless you need to be in a place of weakness and here is Elizabeth and Zariah let us look at it in the Book of Luke chapter 1 I'll just read in English listen verse 12 12 and when Zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and thou shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and it shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall eat unto the Lord their God and shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and a disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord and Zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall I know this for I am an old man and my wife well stricken in years what are you talking about angel huh in other words zakarias is telling the Ang what are you talking about do you see this happening anyway I'm an old man my wife is old what are you talking about and the angel answering said unto him I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and I am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these th GL Tidings and behold thou shal be dump and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in this season this is so touching to me here is an angel of the Lord that comes down to speak to a priest and the priest you would say is the best person to hear from God but when the priest when the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord explained everything listen the angel of the Lord said your wife who is Buren Elizabeth is going to have a child not a girl but a boy listen and his name shall be called John how many points are those those are two points number one your wife is going to have a child number two his name shall be John number three you shall have joy and gladness number four many shall reice at his birth number five he shall be great in the sight of the Lord all these are utterances from the angel of the Lord number six he will be filled with the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb number seven many of the children of the Lord shall be turned to the god thereby fulfilling Malachi the prophecy seven good points from the Angel's mouth instead of the man rejoicing oh praise God hallelujah I'm a very old man what are you talking about my wife is also old how is it going to happen many times when you watch or or listen to brother Bam's meetings in a prayer line men come and they hear Brother bam speaking and then they they answer says your name is you are from this place your sicknesses God is saying you healed and a woman comes hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yeah sister you are nervous don't fear that's the presence of the Holy Spirit hallelujah hallelujah he has not even said anything do you see where strength lies strength in weakness and then he goes ahead your name is m hallelujah hallelujah he not even say the name yet and by the time he doesn't even say lot said you are healed away rej hallelujah hallelujah that's how it would happen Amen in our church I want men who are going to shout like women in church hallelu yes sir they say women shout a lot but in church we want to be like a woman we are the bride of Christ the woman is a weaker vessel means she's at a place of advantage to attract the power of the Holy Ghost and here zaras he has everything and he was [Music] M seven good points and the angel was angry the angel was angry he says do you even know what you're talking about do you know who is talking to you I am Gabriel I stand in the presence of God and I'm sent to you to show you this good news and you're speaking nonsense because of this you are going to be Dum oh God may God help us so that when the word comes we learn to say Amen do you see how it gries God you to hear the word and doubt or be silent God wants you to receive it to accept it that one makes him happy makes him happy but if you don't there is repercussion The Man became dump and afterwards he says you are going to be dump you not speak a word you will not say anything do you know why because God did not want this man who doubted to go and say what the angel said God had Plan B he say I've spoken to you as the head of the of the woman but you didn't believe me my plan be is to go to the my weak vessel I am going to go to my weaker vessel where I will show my strength Hallelujah Hallelujah and in Luke 1 verse 24 after those days his wife Elizabeth listen please conceived and he herself five months saying thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my repr among men I have a question for the church where did Elizabeth get these things from how did she not God dealt with her maybe God may not have said something but Elizabeth could sense the presence of women sense the presence of God better than men oh God make all the men like that Hallelujah one one one day young man came to say Pastor can you imagine today I cried in the church I said what are you talking about you should cry every service every service whenever you have an opportunity to be weak and vulnerable Hallelujah h Elizabeth she conceived and she began to give a testimony she wasn't there when the angel was speaking but that's just the beginning listen there is more sistera verse 59 and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they and and they called him zacharius after the name of his father the child shall be called Zacharias Elizabeth was around and Elizabeth said what did you say he shall He Shall be Called John what Mary what did you say Elizabeth what did you say were you there when Gabriel where did you get the name you remember that was the first point the second point the Ang your wife shall have a boy and his name shall be John let me tell you a mystery the angel must have gone and told Elizabeth about this [Applause] news and he made sure he made zachar Dum the one who shall declare the good news will be a believer the one God will speak to will be a believer the one who the angels will appear to will be a weak person a real genuine believer of the supernatural hallelujah hallelujah so no my name is John and they said unto her what are you talking about woman there is no one in your among your family that are called by that name I love this church verse 62 and they made signs to his father so so they went to zakaras we want to know the name of the boy which means he couldn't even here he couldn't talk if you refuse to hear God he will make you Dum and death spiritually speaking and that you will no longer hear him friends I want to always hear God when God speaks I want to hear I don't want to hear him the second time I want to hear him the first time and he made signs to his father tell us the name bring me that table and I bought the table and he gave them the pen and he started writing John because he already had heard it from the angel you remember he already knew but because of unbelief God allow him to say it fast so God made him dump and when they brought a piece of paper and he wrote John everybody was like name same name like Elizabeth say and immediately when he wrote it down that is a sign of faith it is a sign of faith God opened him up he said now you can speak now you can speak because you have accepted to be in a place of weakness if you don't accept to be in a place of weakness God will never speak to you God speaks to you if you decide and accept to be a weak vessel that's why our sisters in that regard are better than us God has always spoke to women better than men even in a home God speaks to the man more than he speaks to the man that's why you should love your wife love her so much because the more you love her the more she will tell you about her secret talks with the Lord Jesus my good Lord that is if you married a Believer hallelujah oh my this is so wonderful let me give you one one last example and then we close you will just read directly from me Judges 13 ver1 and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines and there was a certain man called a certain man of Zora of the family of the danites whose name was man and his wife was baren and bear not another story are you interested would you like to hear all right and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said to her behold now you are bar and you bear not but you shall conceive and you will bear a son now there beware I pray thee and drink not wine no strong drink and eat not Anyan thing for thou sh conceive bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines how many points so many points God the woman was listening was amen then the woman came and told her husband saying my darling my dear husband a man of God came unto me and he continence was like the continence of an Angel very terrible but I asked him not when he was neither he told me his name but he said unto me behold thou sh conceive and bear a son and now now drink no wine no strong drink neither eat an unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death have you heard I wanted you to see a point there before we continue the woman did not ask anything everything the angel said she just said amen amen amen amen amen she even forgot to ask the name of the Ang and where you came from she just believed if it was the man let us see and her husband now when he had those things he went to prayer he said Lord let let the man of God which thou did send come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born and Goden to the voice of so you would think God would come and speak to man let us continue but the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manand was not even with her oh oh my God and the woman made Hast the moment she saw the angel she ran and she showed her husband and said unto him behold the man has come back he has appeared to me again the one came the other day and man arose and he went after his wife so the wife was running and and the man was following in spiritual things in spiritual things you need to work with your wife my dear because in because she's the weaker vessel God uses them so much in here she's leading Mana is following why because she can see what Mana cannot she can hear what what let me take you take me my now you you are very busy you want to marry a sex Queen how will she lead you to theel she will lead you to hell that's why when married Jezebel jeel led her to to the woman with the spiritual things the woman is the one to build your home that's why it says a foolish woman will te home with own sister if you allow that Bo music in your home you allow your children to sleep without praying you allow your home not to have a family because you not cooking in time and you're so tired and you're just sleeping without teaching your children how to pray your home is broken you have to lead the way as much as the man is the priest of the home the woman God has blessed her there to help build that home and so we see here many times God loves speaking to women fast even my wife God spoke to her about me before I knew that I was supposed to marry her my wife always shy when I say that like people think but it is biblical God works that way listen notice here so she leades the way and uh and uh man said unto the angel now they have arrived okay which verse were we on verse 11 and manah said now let thy words come to pass first of all he asked he went after his wife he came to the man and he said unto him Mr Angel tell me are you the man that spoke to the woman and the angel said I am and said now let thy words come to pass how shall we order the child and how shall we do un him imagine the man is asking many questions that's why God always comes to the woman because the woman doesn't have ask all questions the woman just believes be it unto me according to what say in one second the man has already asked two questions and the angel of the Lord said unto man of all that I said unto the woman let her be aware you man what are you talking about I've already spoken to your wife so whatever have said to her let I just be aware of praise God she may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine and blah blah blah and verse 15 and man said unto the angel I pray thee let us detain you here until we shall have made ready a kid for thee and the angel of the Lord said unto man though thou detain me I will not eat of thy bread and if thou offer a bur offering th must offer it unto the Lord for man knew not that he was an angel of the Lord and said the of the Lord knew not I wonder whether the woman knew not who told the woman that this was was a man of the Lord Revelation said unto the Ang of the Lord what is thy name that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honor the woman never asked the name this man is very busy tell us what is your name and the angel of the Lord said to him why do you ask my name why what is wrong with you it is a secret I will not tell you the angel could not disclose nothing to the man everything the angel told the man is what he had already told the woman and he told the woman he told the man when the woman was there are you following me now but the angel of the Lord did not praise God so man took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord and the angel did wondrously and manoah and his wife looked on it came to pass when the flame went up toward Heaven from off the altar that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame and man and wife looked on it and fell on their face the ground but the angel of the Lord did no more appear to manoah and to his wife then manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord said unto his wife we shall surely die because we have seen God oh man man what is wrong with men but his wife she said unto him if the Lord were pleased to kill us he would not have received a burn offering and meat offering at our a we receiving Revelation that is strength Church my God my God strength that a man did not have if God wanted to kill us he would not have received this offering from our neither would he have showed us all these things no would would would us at this time have told us such things as these and the woman not the man the woman be a son and called his name and the child grew and the Lord blessed him Hallelujah Church there is strength in weakness I want to be like manoah's wife I want to be like zachariah's wife I want to be like them I want to be like Han I want to be like Mary I want to be humble and weak in the presence of God that when he speaks I will hear and when I hear I will act upon it praise God God bless you [Music] m let the weak say I'm [Music] strong [Music] Hallelujah let the weak say I am strong let the pool say I am rich let I blind see I can see is what the Lord
