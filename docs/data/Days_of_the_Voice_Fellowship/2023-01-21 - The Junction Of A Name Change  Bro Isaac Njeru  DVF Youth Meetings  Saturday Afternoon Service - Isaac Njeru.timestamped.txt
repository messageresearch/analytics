[16:51] I'd like to greet you all once again in
[16:53] the precious name of Allah
[17:00] amen it was a marvelous time
[17:05] I don't know how many of you really
[17:08] caught the concept
[17:11] I was just speaking with brother Isaac
[17:15] and both of us agreed that the morning
[17:17] service had way too much content
[17:23] to all the young people need it
[17:30] and I might also encourage you to go
[17:33] back
[17:35] after you've left here
[17:37] when you've got your dormitory
[17:42] and listen to that again
[17:46] and you can after leaving these meetings
[17:48] you can choose to go and listen to them
[17:49] again
[17:53] and so I believe it will it will be a
[17:57] blessing not only to you
[17:59] later on that we'll be able to hear them
[18:04] so this uh this afternoon
[18:12] um
[18:14] by uh by show of hands let me see those
[18:17] who know
[18:18] or had I've had brother Isaac and
[18:21] general minister
[18:27] okay just just those from Nairobi
[18:29] anymore from
[18:35] Uganda
[18:39] okay two
[18:40] all right
[18:42] so I can see we don't have any
[18:44] expectation
[18:46] that's good and bad
[18:51] yeah
[18:52] oh oh okay pastor Emma is correcting me
[18:56] saying the expectation must not be very
[18:57] high
[19:01] brother Isaac and uh brother Isaac and
[19:04] and I uh go back um I don't want to say
[19:07] many years because myself I'm not many
[19:09] years
[19:12] ago
[19:14] and uh his uh he ministers at uh Pastor
[19:19] Wycliffe kabel was church in Nairobi
[19:21] awareness in Nairobi and I have I I the
[19:26] first time I I got an opportunity to sit
[19:28] under his ministry was when we visited
[19:30] there we were on Uninvited and we just
[19:34] showed up with my wife and so I sat and
[19:36] it happened that he was the one
[19:37] ministering communities
[19:44] thoroughly enjoyed this ministry
[19:48] life was really very much impacted
[19:52] and as I sat there I said to myself
[19:56] many young people need to listen to this
[19:58] ministry
[20:01] I don't know how many years ago was that
[20:03] maybe
[20:16] like I said this was not a plan or an
[20:20] arrangement which was made ahead of time
[20:24] I did not plan for him to be here
[20:27] he did not plan to be here
[20:34] I've also had an opportunity to travel
[20:36] with him to Nigeria once
[20:39] I was invited over there to preach some
[20:42] convention and then he came right
[20:47] um
[20:50] God gave us wonderful time many young
[20:53] people were filled with the Holy Ghost
[20:54] in those meetings
[20:58] and we have we have also had some quite
[21:01] uh light memories
[21:05] when we were you know it was like a camp
[21:08] meeting and writing
[21:10] in Nigeria they told us now
[21:13] in the morning we are going for a
[21:16] morning cry
[21:19] so we did not know myself and brother
[21:21] Isaac looked at each other what is a
[21:23] morning Cry he's an organization
[21:26] so this Brethren what they do
[21:29] they get um I don't know how to call it
[21:33] but just maybe bottles like metallic
[21:35] bottles
[21:37] [Music]
[21:39] some some Stone to some things
[21:47] and then they just begin
[21:55] [Applause]
[22:08] they said evangelism
[22:13] we went but we stopped on the way and we
[22:15] went back
[22:19] because brother Isaac can die our
[22:21] evangelism that we are used to do ranga
[22:24] brothers
[22:31] that's what we do and I think that's
[22:34] also another connection I have with him
[22:37] so we've got a moment someplace we went
[22:40] to a Township uh one of the villages and
[22:42] he spoke together
[22:45] and that was wonderful
[22:48] so this afternoon
[22:51] speak to us
[22:54] amen amen and uh he will be speaking two
[22:58] meetings in these meetings
[23:01] and also one tomorrow
[23:05] so let us be expected
[23:08] the Lord has already given us
[23:35] although some people think I look older
[23:38] than both of them
[23:41] actually his last born is 12 years
[23:46] and I know there are many of you who
[23:48] thought he was not even married yet
[23:52] so brother Michael is not young he's
[23:54] about to be a grandpa
[23:57] how old is your first one
[24:00] 18 18 is his first born
[24:03] he has three children he didn't tell us

[30:25] be in the house of the Lord foreign
[30:40] foreign
[31:04] the Bible says and he arose up that
[31:07] night
[31:09] and took his two wives and two
[31:13] women servants and his 11 Sons
[31:17] and passed over

[31:33] over that he had
[31:36] and Jacob was left alone and there is so
[31:41] the man with him until the breaking of
[31:44] the day
[31:46] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[31:49] against him he touched the hollow of his
[31:53] thigh
[31:55] and the hollow of Jacob's die was out of
[31:58] joints and he wrestled with as he
[32:00] wrestled with him
[32:02] and he said let me go for the daybreaker
[32:05] and he said I will not let thee except
[32:09] thou bless me
[32:11] and he said unto him what is thy name
[32:14] and he said Jacob and he said thy name
[32:17] shall
[32:18] be no more Jacob but Israel for as a
[32:23] prince has thou power with God and with
[32:26] men and has prevailed verse 29 and Jacob
[32:30] asked him and said tell me I pretty thy
[32:35] name and he said wherefore he said that
[32:38] thou Dost ask after my name
[32:42] and he blessed blessed him fair and
[32:46] Jacob came called is the name of the

[32:57] and as he passed over penual this the
[33:00] sun rose up upon him and he halted upon
[33:03] his die therefore the children of Israel

[3:43:04] thing
[3:43:05] amen amen
[3:43:08] so we have a change of plans together
[3:43:11] we're not going to go for supper that
[3:43:14] we're going to gain that we're supposed
[3:43:15] to have an early supper for those who
[3:43:16] are residents here because
[3:43:19] what we are going to do nature together
[3:43:22] we are going to go for refreshments and
[3:43:24] tea together
[3:43:27] stretch up a little stretch up a little
[3:43:29] bit
[3:43:30] uh we've been in one place for a long
[3:43:33] time
[3:43:34] for you to have some tea together and
[3:43:38] then
[3:43:39] um I think in 30 minutes
[3:43:42] the song leader will be starting the
[3:43:44] next service
[3:43:46] so then for the residents after the last
[3:43:49] service that's when we shall have our
[3:43:51] supper
[3:43:53] is
[3:43:55] Guru how many think that's okay
[3:44:00] I'll ask again how many think that's
[3:44:02] okay
[3:44:04] all right so
[3:44:06] that's at least at least 90 percent of
[3:44:08] you
[3:44:10] that's that's perfect um
[3:44:19] yes we are Africans
[3:44:23] ah man
[3:44:25] I I when where's brother
[3:44:29] you know they hosted us at the
[3:44:31] convention
[3:44:35] four sixty six services
[3:44:44] so so here we we we are having a long
[3:44:47] time that you want for one you know and
[3:44:50] and just spending more time in the
[3:44:53] presence otherwise you would have had
[3:44:54] also six or seven Services
[3:44:58] I think it's a good thing for the bride
[3:45:00] to gather around the world
[3:45:04] if God if the word of God does not
[3:45:06] entertain you then what what is going to
[3:45:08] entertainment
[3:45:11] movies
[3:45:13] Hollywood
[3:45:15] Netflix
[3:45:18] games what's up what's up
[3:45:22] I really believe that these meetings
[3:45:26] we're not going to have young people
[3:45:28] together we are not going to have young
[3:45:30] people doing this again
[3:45:35] foreign
