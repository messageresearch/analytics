[21:22] 13 everybody there if you there just say

[21:30] and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[21:33] said unto him where art thou and he said
[21:37] I heard thy voice in the garden and I
[21:40] was afraid because I was
[21:44] naked and I he
[21:57] myself
[21:58] [Music]
[22:01] and he said who told thee that thou was
[22:04] naked hast thou eaten of the tree
[22:06] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[22:08] should not shouldest not
[22:09] [Music]
[22:18] eat and the man said the woman whom thou
[22:22] Gest to
[22:23] me who whom excuse me whom thou Gest to
[22:27] be with me she gave me of the tree and I
[22:30] did
[22:38] eat and the Lord God said unto the woman
[22:42] what is this that thou has done and the
[22:45] woman said the serpent beged me and I
[22:49] did
[22:50] [Music]
[22:56] it
[23:01] did you see
[23:03] that I I I hope that all of us
[23:07] followed Adam heard the voice of God in
[23:10] the
[23:12] garden and he was afraid because he was
[23:16] naked so he hid
[23:18] himself and then when God came to
[23:22] Adam he said what is this that you have
[23:26] done and Adam said
[23:30] it is the woman who you gave to
[23:33] me to be with
[23:36] me she gave me of the
[23:38] tree and I
[23:40] ate and so the Lord came to the woman
[23:43] now what is this that you have
[23:48] done it is not me
[23:51] also it is the serpent which beg
[23:56] me praise
[23:59] God so no one accepted
[24:04] responsibility each of them blame the
[24:08] other

[26:43] learned new
[26:45] things and about two three desire to
[26:48] hear more of
[26:51] this so I pray for them that uh God
[26:54] would give us another opportunity with
[26:56] them so that we can continue to share
[26:57] share this message with
[27:01] them praise the
[27:03] Lord amen and so to to today I'm
[27:07] speaking on I don't know whether I will
[27:09] get done but I'm going to be a bit fast
[27:11] because I have a lot to cover on this
[27:17] subject and I don't desire to break it
[27:20] into another
[27:24] service so just stay with me and be here
[27:26] with all your mind
[27:30] all your
[27:31] heart be here physically
[27:34] and if you're streaming also don't allow
[27:37] anything to
[27:41] distra praise
[27:43] God
[27:47] blame so here is Adam and
[27:50] Eve and because when God created
[27:56] Adam he created Adam and gave him
[27:59] dominion over the everything that was on
[28:05] Earth but Adam was you remember when God
[28:08] created Adam and Adam within Adam was
[28:16] Eve because it says he created male and
[28:21] female and yet he had cre one
[28:26] man of
[28:28] God so you see God just like God God is
[28:33] is many in
[28:37] [Music]
[28:39] one God is is
[28:43] much God is not one like your finger is
[28:47] [Music]
[28:49] one and yet there are not more than one
[28:54] God is one God but in him there are many
[29:01] attributes and so we notice that the
[29:04] same way he was the same nature that he
[29:08] was he also created
[29:11] man and later on he comes and takes um
[29:15] in Genesis 2 he makes man to
[29:20] sleep he takes the woman out of the
[29:25] man by taking out of the
[29:29] ribs and he uh molded Man Out of the
[29:34] Dust of the
[29:38] ground and then he breathed in him the
[29:41] breath of
[29:43] life and the Bible says Man became a
[29:45] living
[29:48] soul but but then we see that after that
[29:51] when he when when he took man to
[29:55] sleep then out of him out of the rib he
[29:59] made a
[30:01] woman and then there was a woman and a
[30:06] man but when Adam saw the
[30:08] woman he said Bor of my BS Flesh of My
[30:13] Flesh shall be called a
[30:16] woman a woman means a part of the
[30:22] man praise God and so uh
[30:27] later on the woman gets another name
[30:29] called
[30:33] Eve and Eve does not mean part of a
[30:37] man but means mother of all
[30:42] living this was after sin had come
[30:46] in and yet Adam was a Son of
[30:50] God so here you have Adam and
[30:54] Eve after sin When sin came into the
[30:58] world so you now have Adam and
[31:02] Eve Son of God and mother of all
[31:07] living what does that mean you see I've
[31:11] spoken that before
[31:12] here when when when Eve
[31:16] fell had a right to leave her
[31:20] alone and Adam would not have fallen
[31:23] into the same
[31:26] sin
[31:28] you know in the book of First Timothy
[31:30] Chapter
[31:32] 2 I think verse 11
[31:35] there the Bible says the woman was in
[31:38] the
[31:41] transgression why because when the
[31:43] serpent came to the
[31:46] woman the woman you know gave
[31:50] herself she accepted to be
[31:54] beged and when that happened had been
[31:57] introduced into the human
[32:00] race but if Adam had not of that same
[32:06] sin you know Eve would be
[32:09] destroyed butam would
[32:12] remain you see brother bam
[32:14] said Adam knew what he was
[32:18] doing because you see he knew Adam
[32:21] somehow by Revelation he knew about the
[32:23] law of
[32:26] redemption
[32:28] because he knew that the woman was a
[32:30] born of his
[32:32] b but he also knew that Adam was a born
[32:35] of Bones of
[32:39] God just like in the New Testament it
[32:42] says that that Christ is the head of the
[32:44] man and the man is the head of the
[32:51] woman and we know that our Prophet also
[32:54] tells us that the the men the husbands
[32:58] will be answerable to their for their
[33:04] wives but the women will
[33:07] not but the men will have to answer
[33:11] for how they treated them what they let
[33:15] them
[33:16] do because you see the man is the is the
[33:18] head of
[33:20] the the man gives both spiritual
[33:25] leadership in the in the and also family
[33:29] leadership as a man you are the head of
[33:31] the
[33:32] home you are supposed to bring the
[33:35] nature of
[33:36] Christ because Christ is also your
[33:40] head and then Christ leads you and you
[33:42] lead your family with the leadership of
[33:49] Christ and so we see that you know man
[33:53] man man also partt of
[33:55] this
[33:57] and the Bible says if the woman gave to
[34:00] the man and together they did
[34:04] it so the man
[34:07] fell but why did the man do
[34:10] that because he knew that this was the
[34:12] only way of redeeming his
[34:17] wife watch when God comes
[34:20] down he does not say Adam and Eve where
[34:23] are
[34:24] you but he says Adam where are
[34:28] you because by
[34:31] calling Eve was
[34:34] called was a part of
[34:37] Adam and if Adam was a
[34:40] sinner andam Eve was a sinner if Adam
[34:45] was to be
[34:46] redeemed Eve was to be
[34:49] redeemed so when Jesus Christ came down
[34:53] to redeem Fallen
[34:55] man he redeemed all Al everything
[34:58] else that was Fallen with
[35:01] man are you following me but now I I
[35:05] don't want to just talk about that
[35:09] story I just want to take a different
[35:12] direction
[35:13] tonight and I want to speak on the blame
[35:19] game I want to bring it out of the Book
[35:21] of
[35:23] Genesis by God's grace bring it down to
[35:26] us
[35:29] today so we see that when when when when
[35:33] Adam now had
[35:36] sinned when you know God gave his word
[35:39] to
[35:40] ad he never gave it to Eve he gave it
[35:44] Adam was
[35:46] responsible 100%
[35:49] responsible the way that word was
[35:52] treated so when God came down he did not
[35:55] ask if
[35:58] he asked
[35:59] Adam he says Adam where are you and he
[36:03] says I heard your voice in the garden
[36:05] and I was afraid because I was
[36:09] naked and I hid myself and he said who
[36:13] told you that you were
[36:16] naked Adam and Eve now we
[36:20] naked so the question is is see
[36:25] nakedness his nakedness
[36:30] [Music]
[36:32] sin what is
[36:34] sin they were already
[36:39] naked before they
[36:42] sin if if you already knew that say
[36:49] amened before they but they were
[36:54] innocent and the devil came
[36:57] and took away their
[37:03] inoc revealing their
[37:07] nakedness and the word speaks of the
[37:10] nakedness in the end
[37:13] time and I want while I'm starting here
[37:16] while trying to to lay this foundation
[37:18] for
[37:19] you I want to uh read um this is a very
[37:22] good message the power of
[37:25] transformation
[37:27] if you can take it up find it and read
[37:31] it but I'm going to read about three
[37:33] paragraphs
[37:35] there I want you to listen to this he
[37:38] says now if you will turn if you wish to
[37:41] write down Revelation the third
[37:45] chapter the Holy Spirit predicting this
[37:48] last
[37:52] agean Pentecostal
[37:55] Church in the last days he said you are
[38:00] naked and blind and don't know
[38:02] it now he says there is God
[38:07] seed there is God
[38:12] seed
[38:14] [Music]
[38:16] seed
[38:19] innocence not knowing at all they were
[38:23] naked under a veil of the Holy Spirit
[38:28] veiling them from
[38:31] sin so here is Adam and Eve before they
[38:34] fell they were veiled with a
[38:38] veil of
[38:40] Innocence veil of the Holy
[38:43] Spirit and they were naked and they
[38:45] didn't know they
[38:47] were but it was the veil of the Holy
[38:51] Spirit are you following me now and he
[38:54] says now in the last age
[38:57] we find here that they are naked
[39:00] again and they don't know it
[39:04] again but it is not the Holy Spirit
[39:09] Veil it is the veil that Satan SLE over
[39:13] Eve back
[39:18] there a ve of
[39:21] last the last
[39:24] Veil they are so filthy till they don't
[39:27] know that they are
[39:32] naked women on the street with shorts on
[39:35] sexy
[39:39] dresses so when you see the generation
[39:41] we are living
[39:43] in When sin came into the
[39:46] world the devil veiled
[39:49] us again with a veil of
[39:53] nakedness but this is
[39:55] filth and the Bible says brother says
[39:58] here that they are naked and they don't
[40:02] know was it
[40:05] yesterday one of the days I went
[40:07] somewhere with my
[40:10] wife and we were SE
[40:12] somewhere and uh it was
[40:16] cold really raining a
[40:19] lot and then there came several several
[40:22] women
[40:24] also and there were dressed in skimpy
[40:30] Scots just above around the level of
[40:33] their
[40:36] thighs and so several of the of the
[40:39] women so my wife commented she said to
[40:42] me the devil has blinded
[40:46] them and is making them
[40:49] suffer they can't they can't even
[40:51] understand is cold and they need to
[40:52] cover themselves
[40:55] up
[40:58] they feel the
[40:59] coldness but they are
[41:01] blinded they are blinded to think that
[41:06] this and so they go out dressed that
[41:10] way sincerely speaking these days when
[41:12] you see some of them walking on the
[41:16] streets sometimes you may think you are
[41:19] dreaming things that are supposed to be
[41:21] dressed in the
[41:24] bedroom in the
[41:28] actually dressing it and walking on the
[41:32] streets and that's why we should feel so
[41:35] sorry for the young younger
[41:38] generation the generation that is
[41:39] actually growing or raising
[41:42] now it's it's going it's facing a a a
[41:46] huge level of
[41:49] difficulty because imagine a young child
[41:52] growing up seeing this kind of
[41:55] thing
[41:57] and then by the time they become of
[41:59] age they feel it is okay to dress that
[42:04] way you know and not until if they seed
[42:07] of
[42:09] God they hear the word of God now the
[42:13] word of God will reveal to them their
[42:17] nakedness and that's why we should
[42:19] preach the word
[42:22] regard and that is why we should never
[42:24] compromise on the word
[42:27] we should not preach to bring to make
[42:30] people
[42:32] comfortable we should preach to make
[42:34] people realize their wrongs and
[42:39] change because the devil has blinded
[42:42] them the devil Sur blinded
[42:45] them and so in the beginning man was
[42:49] naked but you see he was naked with
[42:55] innocence he did not know and then when
[42:58] the devil came down he took away that
[43:02] innocence and man realized they
[43:07] naked but today since that time man has
[43:11] been
[43:13] naked naked with
[43:15] Fields naked on the
[43:18] streets you know and the devil has
[43:20] blinded their
[43:22] eyes they can't realize they
[43:25] naked they need they need the
[43:28] word to show them that they are
[43:31] naked you sisters you can see the big
[43:35] difference between you and the women on
[43:37] the
[43:38] street and let me tell you there is a
[43:41] difference there must be a difference
[43:44] between a Christian and a
[43:47] nonbeliever in the way they dress
[43:51] because the way you dress shows who you
[43:54] are on the inside
[43:57] but you see uh the when when when man
[44:02] when when when sin came into the
[44:06] world then came God and he asked
[44:12] Adam what is this that you have
[44:16] done and here is my sermon
[44:20] tonight
[44:21] Adam did not accept what he did
[44:29] Adam refused to
[44:32] accept he
[44:35] said it's not me God said what have you
[44:39] done it's the
[44:41] woman not
[44:44] me sincerely was it the
[44:47] woman no was it the
[44:52] woman you may say what the woman seduced
[44:54] him
[44:57] but he was responsible for his
[45:04] actions each individual is responsible
[45:06] for his
[45:10] actions but Adam never
[45:13] [Music]
[45:15] owned
[45:17] responsibility the
[45:19] woman me I'm
[45:22] I'm I I I did not mean to do it the is
[45:26] the
[45:28] woman and then God said okay he went to
[45:32] the woman woman what is this that you
[45:34] have
[45:35] done me it was not me it's not
[45:40] me it is the
[45:43] serpent well you may say the
[45:48] serpent was the
[45:52] culprit because yes the Bible says the
[45:55] serpent be
[45:59] but by the there is something I want you
[46:00] to see
[46:02] here that is true the Ser
[46:07] Eve but Eve had to own her
[46:15] actions she was
[46:18] responsible for what she did with her
[46:21] mind she was responsible for what she
[46:24] did with her body
[46:26] you in the same way are
[46:30] responsible tell your neighbor you are
[46:33] responsible you cannot say someone else
[46:36] is you are
[46:38] responsible 100%
[46:42] responsible if say is the
[46:44] Ser but let me ask you a question do you
[46:48] see anywhere in the in the scripture
[46:50] here where thought comes to the serent
[46:53] and says what is this that you have done
[47:00] why because the serpent is not a human
[47:05] being a
[47:07] serpent serpent was a
[47:11] beast and I told you there is one thing
[47:14] you can look it up I preached on that
[47:16] the power of free moral
[47:18] agen there is one thing that God has
[47:21] given only the human
[47:24] race has not given it to any Beast he
[47:28] has not given it to any other animal any
[47:31] other bir of fish he has given it to you
[47:33] who is listening to me
[47:35] today and that is the power of free
[47:38] moral
[47:39] agent the power to make a
[47:42] decision you cannot blame anyone for
[47:45] what you have done or what has happened
[47:47] to
[47:49] you you and you alone have that power
[47:52] over your
[47:54] life the devil cannot be
[47:57] blamed many people come and
[48:00] say I'm sorry the devil tempted
[48:03] me that is what exactly Eve
[48:06] said that the serpent temped me the
[48:10] Ser no God was looking for something
[48:14] here can you accept
[48:16] [Music]
[48:18] responsibility do you know who you are
[48:21] if the church knows who she
[48:23] is she will accept her resp
[48:27] responsibility we have a responsibility
[48:30] to this
[48:32] word the way we live the things we do
[48:37] after we have known the
[48:39] truth we are directly responsible before
[48:46] God but what do human beings
[48:49] do human beings play the blame
[48:54] game
[48:56] how many think about it how many times
[49:00] have you thought that you are the way
[49:01] you are because of
[49:06] somebody if it wasn't for for that
[49:09] person I would have been
[49:11] [Applause]
[49:12] better if it wasn't for so and so I
[49:15] would have done
[49:18] better that is wrong don't blame anyone
[49:21] for your
[49:24] condition
[49:26] brother B in the message perfect
[49:27] strength by Perfect
[49:31] weakness there is something I'm trying
[49:33] to come to
[49:34] him if you can diligently follow
[49:37] me he says I've often
[49:40] said the greatest enemy I got is William
[49:45] Bram this is him saying to
[49:48] himself he's the only one that gets in
[49:50] God's
[49:53] way so I can say the greatest enemy I
[49:55] have
[49:59] is can you speak your greatest
[50:02] enemy your greatest enemy
[50:06] is the
[50:10] devil some of you are even not
[50:14] accepting because you like how can I be
[50:16] my
[50:18] greatest I love myself our Prophet said
[50:22] he was his greatest
[50:24] enemy
[50:26] he's the one that gets in God's
[50:29] way he's the one that gets
[50:31] lazy he's the one that gets to a place
[50:34] sometimes where he thinks he can do
[50:36] something about
[50:40] it and when he
[50:42] does that shows God right out of the
[50:47] picture there is nothing you can do of
[50:49] yourself and for
[50:52] yourself when Jesus was here on Earth
[50:56] if you will realize it Jesus knew who
[50:59] his greatest enemy
[51:02] was he knew if he would even try to lift
[51:05] himself
[51:08] up he will not accomplish the mission
[51:11] why he came on
[51:13] Earth Jesus had to Humble
[51:16] himself even when he was God himself in
[51:20] flesh Jesus realized without God he can
[51:23] do nothing
[51:27] but many times we think we are
[51:30] something oh if I had money I would do
[51:34] this oh if I had power I would do this
[51:38] listen you can do you can accomplish
[51:41] nothing on your
[51:43] own Adam could accomplish
[51:46] nothing on his own he needed a
[51:50] supernatural
[51:52] power we all need a supernatural power
[51:56] we cannot accomplish anything on our
[51:59] own so if you get to a place where you
[52:02] think you can do something about your
[52:08] situation you know me I'm
[52:10] intelligent I will make it you know me I
[52:13] have money I will make it you know I'm
[52:15] educated I will make it there is nothing
[52:18] you can accom on your
[52:21] own you need something to rely
[52:24] on you need a power to depend
[52:28] on that is the power of
[52:31] God and here says when I can get rid of
[52:36] that
[52:38] guy if I can get rid
[52:41] of when I can get to a
[52:44] place that he is out of the
[52:47] way then God can come
[52:51] over and do
[52:54] things William Bram knows nothing
[52:59] about that is
[53:02] humility Up Is
[53:05] Down Down is
[53:08] up if you want to get
[53:11] anywhere in this life humble
[53:14] yourself if you cannot humble
[53:17] yourself you will never get
[53:21] anywhere nothing can take you
[53:24] anywhere humility is
[53:27] key and he says that's when God can use
[53:31] you that's when he can use any of
[53:35] you he can use anybody when he get when
[53:38] we get out of the
[53:41] way but as long as we got ourselves in
[53:45] the
[53:46] way then we
[53:48] cannot oh perfect strength is in perfect
[53:54] weakness
[53:55] friends you need to
[53:57] realize that you are
[54:00] nothing by
[54:03] yourself and the greatest
[54:06] enemy that you have is
[54:10] [Music]
[54:11] yourself I am my greatest
[54:14] enemy many times people sit there and
[54:18] they think about how much
[54:24] people
[54:25] some HS
[54:29] me
[54:32] about and then begin to be
[54:35] angry and then many of them even get
[54:37] cancers
[54:39] out many of them get
[54:42] depression and then so and so
[54:46] comes he
[54:48] me what is that you are so full of
[54:53] yourself you think you know everything
[54:56] you think you you you are better than
[54:58] anybody and
[54:59] everybody and that is your greatest
[55:04] enemy
[55:05] Christianity is accepting you
[55:10] nothing is accepting to humble
[55:13] [Music]
[55:15] yourself there is something I'm trying
[55:17] to come to
[55:19] tonight by God's grace and if he allows
[55:22] us I believe it will be a blessing to
[55:24] all of us
[55:26] we all need to Humble ourselves we need
[55:28] to come to a place of total surrender
[55:30] and realizing that there is someone
[55:32] bigger and great than all of
[55:38] us
[55:40] hallelujah that's the problem that Adam
[55:43] had and Eve they were so full of
[55:48] themselves Adam God said Adam what is
[55:52] this that you have done God me
[55:59] me I know myself
[56:02] me is the woman
[56:05] you not it cannot be
[56:07] me me no no way no way Adam
[56:12] refused at the same time Adam was hiding
[56:16] himself at the same time Adam was
[56:19] covering himself with he
[56:22] leaves because he had a voice in
[56:27] his knew he needed
[56:30] something knew he had
[56:33] fallen but Adam was losing
[56:37] something there is something he did not
[56:39] have and that was
[56:43] conviction and I'm going to come and
[56:45] talk about that
[56:46] tonight many Christians don't have
[56:51] conviction and that's why they live in
[56:53] sin and can even manage to come and be
[56:56] in
[57:01] church when it came
[57:03] to what have you
[57:08] done
[57:14] really
[57:18] me cannot
[57:20] be I'll have you know it is
[57:23] Ser
[57:26] do you realize that serpent has no
[57:31] will Mr serpent was only walking in the
[57:34] garden that
[57:36] day and the next thing Mr serpent
[57:39] realized was the devil the real serent
[57:43] came
[57:47] and and Mr serpent
[57:50] realized he had more greater abilities
[57:57] he received the
[57:59] Revelation he had not received
[58:03] before and the devil
[58:07] told see that is a
[58:11] woman Ser do you know that you can have
[58:13] a
[58:15] child do you know
[58:18] do Mr serpent was a victim of the
[58:22] [Music]
[58:23] circumstance
[58:26] that's why what have you
[58:30] done time with that Ser was not
[58:35] Satan was a
[58:37] beast you have to understand was a beast
[58:39] like
[58:41] creature just almost like you and
[58:45] me it was a victim of
[58:49] circumstances and here
[58:51] is human being with the power of free
[58:55] moral
[58:56] AG blaming such a
[58:59] creature what a
[59:02] shame Eve had to own up for Action had
[59:06] to do the
[59:10] same that's why when it came to
[59:13] serpent God never wasted time he only
[59:18] said you I'm going to take you and break
[59:21] every
[59:23] B
[59:26] and you will begin eating
[59:28] that and walking on your
[59:31] bed praise
[59:35] God
[59:36] listen
[59:38] Adam had a different
[59:41] opinion he thought the problem was
[59:44] Eve Eve thought it was
[59:47] Adam they failed to realize that as long
[59:50] as they did not know what the problem
[59:53] was
[59:56] they could not know amen they could not
[59:59] know whether they needed help or
[1:00:03] not listen if you oh my God are you
[1:00:05] listening to me church if you don't know
[1:00:08] what the problem
[1:00:09] [Music]
[1:00:10] is you will not know whether you need
[1:00:14] help you will not even know what kind of
[1:00:17] help you
[1:00:18] need you will not even know how to be
[1:00:21] helped or even who to help you
[1:00:25] but when you realize where the problem
[1:00:28] is you will humble
[1:00:30] yourself and you will ask
[1:00:33] for but here is Adam and Eve because
[1:00:38] they did not
[1:00:41] know what the problem
[1:00:44] was they hid
[1:00:47] themselves did they come running back to
[1:00:50] god father father we have SE
[1:00:55] no they hi themselves why they had no
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:05] conviction all they had was blaming one
[1:01:10] another imagine ad and
[1:01:13] Eve in theard
[1:01:16] ofen hiding themselves in the
[1:01:19] thi which is the type of their
[1:01:23] denomination each of them was blaming
[1:01:25] the
[1:01:25] other but if you are the one
[1:01:33] who no let me tell
[1:01:36] you let me tell you know what
[1:01:42] talking Mr Man let me tell
[1:01:45] you God gave you the word you to guide
[1:01:49] me why didn't you why didn't you tell me
[1:01:51] it was
[1:01:52] wrong no but when you came to me it was
[1:01:55] already
[1:01:57] done no but but but also you accepted
[1:01:59] when I
[1:02:00] came also you you you no you you you no
[1:02:03] you you everybody was saying
[1:02:05] you while they were doing that they were
[1:02:08] hiding
[1:02:12] themselves playing their blame
[1:02:15] game and the whole
[1:02:18] time
[1:02:19] God was not
[1:02:23] there amen
[1:02:25] the moment the devil gets you to that
[1:02:29] place God will not be
[1:02:33] there you die in your
[1:02:36] sin God is not there but when you
[1:02:39] realize what the problem
[1:02:41] is you cry out
[1:02:44] for says father I need
[1:02:50] you let's talk a little bit about the
[1:02:52] absence of conviction
[1:02:57] now due to lack of due to lack of
[1:03:00] failure to admit one's
[1:03:04] sin that that causes lack
[1:03:16] of you cannot sit down there and
[1:03:23] selfle you are just playing the blame
[1:03:27] game and anybody who plays the blame
[1:03:32] game can never be convicted of
[1:03:37] sin we have them many times in
[1:03:41] meetings and even some of you who are
[1:03:43] may be following
[1:03:45] online you might have
[1:03:48] experienced or you here and you sit with
[1:03:51] the
[1:03:52] people and everybody tells them
[1:03:55] but you are wrong you are the one is
[1:03:59] wrong and he says when he can't have any
[1:04:02] more
[1:04:03] words says okay if I'm
[1:04:08] wrong if I am
[1:04:11] wrong which means I don't have a
[1:04:13] revelation I am
[1:04:16] wrong you think I am
[1:04:18] wrong no I'm
[1:04:21] sorry that's not true
[1:04:23] repentance
[1:04:25] that's not true
[1:04:27] repentance and that is why Adam hid
[1:04:29] himself away from
[1:04:32] God conviction will bring you to God
[1:04:38] not let us take little time to learn
[1:04:43] about there in the Book of John
[1:04:47] 16:8 the Bible says and when he is come
[1:04:50] he will reprove the world of sin and of
[1:04:52] righteousness and of judgment
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:58] and in the Amplified it says when he
[1:05:01] comes meaning the Holy Spirit he will
[1:05:03] convict the
[1:05:07] world about the guil of
[1:05:11] sin praise God when the Holy
[1:05:15] Spirit friends we need the Holy
[1:05:19] Spirit when the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:05:21] your
[1:05:23] life convicts you of
[1:05:27] sin that's when you'll find
[1:05:30] someone who you did not tell that they
[1:05:32] were
[1:05:33] wrong but they will come to you by
[1:05:37] themselves I have had a few come in my
[1:05:39] life and they did things that I didn't
[1:05:42] even have an idea that they did to
[1:05:44] me and they come and say you know I'm
[1:05:47] sorry I did this and this and
[1:05:49] this what was that that was
[1:05:52] conviction when the Holy Ghost oh praise
[1:05:55] God when the Holy Ghost comes in your
[1:05:58] soul he will bring
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:04] conviction now I was reading and I fell
[1:06:07] my eyes fell on this article which I
[1:06:09] felt I really needed to read it all
[1:06:16] for listen very good words he says to
[1:06:20] help you to help us understand what the
[1:06:22] what conviction of sin
[1:06:27] is we can look at what it is
[1:06:32] not first conviction is not simply a
[1:06:36] guilty
[1:06:41] conscience or even
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:06:50] shame so and seen have done this m
[1:06:56] when you catch people stealing
[1:07:00] red-handed they'll say I'm sorry not
[1:07:03] what you think I'm
[1:07:05] sorry I'm really sorry I am really
[1:07:08] sorry is that out of
[1:07:13] conviction that's just a guilty
[1:07:18] conscience such feelings are naturally
[1:07:21] experienced by almost everyone
[1:07:28] everyone whether Christians or not when
[1:07:32] you steal you feel
[1:07:35] bad when you do something bad you feel
[1:07:40] bad even if no one has seen
[1:07:43] you it is a
[1:07:46] feeling but it is not
[1:07:49] conviction but this is not true
[1:07:51] conviction because you continue still in
[1:07:53] that se
[1:07:57] you do it and you to do it and you to do
[1:08:01] it but time you do it you feel
[1:08:05] bad so you cannot say it is
[1:08:09] conviction you just have a bad feeling
[1:08:11] because you did something
[1:08:15] bad just like Adam went there and he ran
[1:08:18] away because he felt
[1:08:21] bad but he was not
[1:08:25] convicted second conviction of sin is
[1:08:29] not a sense of fear of
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:41] divine if I've done this I don't know is
[1:08:44] going to take me to
[1:08:48] hell those feelings to are commonly
[1:08:50] experienced in the hearts and minds of
[1:08:53] sinners
[1:08:57] one time when I called a thief that
[1:08:58] stole from me I asked him a
[1:09:01] question he was in police
[1:09:04] custody I asked him a question don't you
[1:09:07] feel bad about what you
[1:09:10] do he said I really
[1:09:13] feel that was not
[1:09:16] conviction right it was just a fear of
[1:09:21] of judgment and and Punishment because
[1:09:23] he was the police's hands he wanted me
[1:09:25] to forgive him so he can come out and
[1:09:26] then continue from where he
[1:09:36] stopped you find here we have more
[1:09:39] Justice in
[1:09:43] Uganda they put tires on
[1:09:45] them and then when they doing that the
[1:09:49] man is very busy
[1:09:50] saying forgive me forgive
[1:09:56] on and very saying let us beat him let
[1:09:59] us let us him let us please if you have
[1:10:03] a faint
[1:10:05] heart you see such a
[1:10:07] person you can't eat for a
[1:10:10] week because it is so
[1:10:14] Dreadful and you
[1:10:16] think the people forgive him because the
[1:10:18] man is
[1:10:21] convicted the man is not convicted
[1:10:24] even as soon as they releasee him that
[1:10:27] very night
[1:10:31] will are
[1:10:36] demons and they need
[1:10:40] conviction before they can
[1:10:43] repent but again true conviction is is
[1:10:46] of sin is of sin true conviction of sin
[1:10:49] rather is something
[1:10:52] different
[1:10:55] thirdly let us see the third thing that
[1:10:57] it is
[1:11:00] not conviction of sin is not merely
[1:11:02] knowledge of right and
[1:11:09] wrong it is not an acceptance to
[1:11:12] scriptures teaching about
[1:11:19] Sin many people read the Bible and are
[1:11:22] fully aware that the wages of sin is
[1:11:28] death yet for all their
[1:11:31] knowledge they continue to live in
[1:11:35] sin they understand the
[1:11:38] consequences but they are far from being
[1:11:41] convicted of their
[1:11:45] sin someone tells you I know fornication
[1:11:48] is
[1:11:50] wrong I know us will go in Hell Fire
[1:11:56] I know those things are
[1:11:57] wrong I know the
[1:12:00] Bible but doesn't mean that they
[1:12:03] convicted they to live in
[1:12:06] sin matter of fact most people who are
[1:12:10] sinners the best Sinners that we have in
[1:12:12] the world
[1:12:13] today they know the Bible almost from
[1:12:16] cover to
[1:12:18] cover so that's why on Sunday preached
[1:12:21] on the power of the r word
[1:12:25] because you can know the L
[1:12:27] word and still remain a
[1:12:30] sinner but when that
[1:12:33] power Hallelujah that power of the Holy
[1:12:37] Ghost that amen that is behind this
[1:12:41] word amen the power that WR this
[1:12:45] word the power that raised up Christ
[1:12:48] from the
[1:12:49] dead when he comes in your
[1:12:52] life when you are living in sin he
[1:12:55] brings conviction to
[1:12:58] you and some you feel you cannot
[1:13:01] continue in that
[1:13:03] [Applause]
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:08] lifestyle the truth is if we experience
[1:13:12] nothing more than a p of
[1:13:15] conscience if we experience nothing more
[1:13:19] than if we just experience a p of
[1:13:22] conscious
[1:13:28] I'm doing something
[1:13:30] wrong aniy at the thought of
[1:13:35] judgment I'm going to go to hell Jud
[1:13:39] anic awareness of
[1:13:44] H then we have Gody then he says then we
[1:13:48] have never truly known the conviction of
[1:13:52] sin
[1:13:56] if the level you are at in your
[1:13:59] life is only to feel in your conscience
[1:14:03] oh I've done something
[1:14:06] wrong and then you feel anxious oh I
[1:14:09] might be
[1:14:11] judged or to just know what amen those
[1:14:15] who go to hell what they
[1:14:18] do and you are on that level
[1:14:22] only then you have never
[1:14:25] known what true conviction of sin
[1:14:30] is question is what is the real
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:35] conviction kind that the Bible speaks
[1:14:39] about the word convict is a translation
[1:14:41] of the Greek word
[1:14:47] elen means to
[1:14:50] convince someone of the truth
[1:14:55] to
[1:14:59] reprove to
[1:15:02] accuse to
[1:15:06] refute to cross examine a
[1:15:13] witness you know you take that
[1:15:16] witness cross examine
[1:15:20] him you refute him and accuse him
[1:15:25] and then you convince
[1:15:27] him that he is
[1:15:30] wrong you convince him that he is wrong
[1:15:34] and you are
[1:15:35] right you convince him that he is wrong
[1:15:40] and he come to that
[1:15:42] place whereby he feels his judg even
[1:15:45] before the judgment is
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:49] passed now the Holy Spirit as a
[1:15:57] persecuting who exposes
[1:16:01] evil he expose oh when when he comes in
[1:16:04] your life he he begins to expose all the
[1:16:08] evil in your
[1:16:10] life and he reproves
[1:16:13] you and he convinces you that you need a
[1:16:19] savior when when he comes in your life
[1:16:23] he convinces you that there is something
[1:16:27] else that you need in your life to be
[1:16:31] able to come out of your
[1:16:34] lifestyle the Holy Spirit reproves
[1:16:37] you the Holy Spirit convinces you of
[1:16:46] sin no one is there he is there to
[1:16:50] convince
[1:16:52] you
[1:16:53] I've seen a few people in the
[1:16:58] ministry over the past you know 15 16
[1:17:02] years I
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:05] preached people who are really
[1:17:10] convicted you tell them no it's all
[1:17:12] right you're
[1:17:13] fine
[1:17:15] no
[1:17:17] no I know what I've
[1:17:20] done I I don't want to live this
[1:17:25] I just want God to change
[1:17:27] me I need
[1:17:30] something these
[1:17:33] people let me tell you if you have ever
[1:17:35] received a conviction in your
[1:17:38] life it is a
[1:17:41] treasure don't disregard
[1:17:44] it work on it because
[1:17:48] conviction brings through
[1:17:52] repentance whereby if you are a
[1:17:55] liar you will be convicted of
[1:17:58] lies and that demon of Lies will be
[1:18:04] exposed you feel oh
[1:18:09] God I need a
[1:18:12] change whereby if you have been living
[1:18:17] Immortal he convinces
[1:18:19] you he convinces you right where you
[1:18:24] that you need to come to a place you
[1:18:27] need to put yourself right you need to
[1:18:30] run to a savior you need to receive the
[1:18:33] Holy
[1:18:34] Ghost he he convinces
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:39] you and then you break down and you
[1:18:42] arrive at that place of
[1:18:47] conviction and only and only then can
[1:18:49] you be
[1:18:51] saved
[1:18:54] let me tell you it is very
[1:18:57] unfortunate but we have many amen
[1:18:59] Christians going church
[1:19:04] Christians professing
[1:19:06] Christians that are not really convicted
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:16] of you are right with
[1:19:19] it you continuing
[1:19:21] normally
[1:19:25] you just feel a little conscious that
[1:19:27] tells you you are
[1:19:31] wrong and he
[1:19:33] say what if
[1:19:39] happens but then you continue right
[1:19:42] on but let me tell you one day when you
[1:19:44] receive
[1:19:46] conviction that will be the beginning of
[1:19:48] your
[1:19:50] deliverance when you receive conviction
[1:19:52] in your
[1:19:53] soul amen he will come and convince you
[1:19:57] of
[1:19:58] sin and then you will receive true and
[1:20:01] genuine Holy Ghost
[1:20:07] repentance to be convicted is to feel
[1:20:10] the sheer
[1:20:12] lomness of
[1:20:21] sin feel hatred
[1:20:24] of you it you had the
[1:20:29] thing you like given this
[1:20:32] cigarettes I no longer love
[1:20:35] them it's not just out of your mind it
[1:20:39] is out of conviction amen being
[1:20:41] convinced by the Holy
[1:20:46] Ghost this happens when we've seen God's
[1:20:51] Beauty his
[1:20:53] Purity his
[1:20:56] Holiness and when you
[1:20:58] recognize that sin canot dwell with
[1:21:03] him when Isaiah stood in the presence of
[1:21:06] God he was immediately overwhelmed by
[1:21:09] his own
[1:21:12] sinfulness Isaiah a
[1:21:15] prophet he stood right there in the
[1:21:17] presence of
[1:21:19] God and even he could not say
[1:21:26] good he could not play the blame game
[1:21:30] anymore he came to a place where he
[1:21:36] realized I'm a
[1:21:38] sinner I need a
[1:21:40] change he said why to
[1:21:43] me I am
[1:21:46] ruined I am a man of unlean
[1:21:50] lips who told him all this
[1:21:53] the Holy Ghost convinced him
[1:21:56] of the Holy Ghost exposed his
[1:22:03] sin and he says I'm a man of unclean
[1:22:07] lips eyes have seen the
[1:22:11] king the Lord
[1:22:13] Almighty he was
[1:22:16] convicted and because of that at that
[1:22:20] moment right at that moment
[1:22:23] the Bible says then God sent down an
[1:22:27] angel and this angel came amen with
[1:22:32] fire that amen that he got out of the
[1:22:35] presence of
[1:22:36] God and he came and touched his
[1:22:39] lips he touched his
[1:22:44] lips and from that moment the man was a
[1:22:47] new
[1:22:48] man in a moment he was a new man when
[1:22:53] you oh glory to God when you are
[1:22:55] convicted if you're a liar and you
[1:22:59] convicted if a fornicator and you
[1:23:02] convicted if you a thief and there is no
[1:23:06] big thief or small Thief a thief is a
[1:23:09] thief if you're a thief and you're
[1:23:12] convicted if you're last fo and you're
[1:23:15] convicted you are going to come to this
[1:23:18] place whereby you will cry out to him
[1:23:23] not out of fear of hell but out of what
[1:23:26] the Holy Spirit has
[1:23:28] re and out of being in the
[1:23:31] presence and seeing the beauty of the
[1:23:34] Cross and seeing the Holiness of
[1:23:37] God oh how can I be like this in the
[1:23:40] presence of a holy ghost how can I dwell
[1:23:43] like this and then to cause you to cry
[1:23:46] out like
[1:23:49] Isaiah and you know what you will
[1:23:51] receive the Holy Ghost right
[1:23:55] there to be
[1:23:58] convicted is to experience and
[1:24:01] dreadfulness of
[1:24:10] sin our attitude toward
[1:24:14] [Music]
[1:24:17] sin becomes at this PO moment uh Point
[1:24:21] like the one that Joseph
[1:24:25] had J fled
[1:24:29] Temptation crying out how can I do this
[1:24:33] great evil and sin against
[1:24:39] God that's
[1:24:42] conviction imagine Joseph he was in a
[1:24:45] place where no man was
[1:24:48] there he could have gone with that woman
[1:24:53] and no one would ever
[1:24:55] find but right in
[1:24:58] his he
[1:25:00] [Music]
[1:25:03] dreaded he
[1:25:07] wased he said how can I
[1:25:11] how can I do this
[1:25:14] thing
[1:25:16] how how can I do this great
[1:25:20] evil against

[1:28:04] the enemy to
[1:28:07] Blackmail you just put yourself right
[1:28:09] with God
[1:28:12] and we are
[1:28:14] convicted when we become mindful of how
[1:28:17] much our sin dishonors
[1:28:21] God
[1:28:27] when David was convicted by the Holy
[1:28:31] Spirit he cried out against you you only
[1:28:36] have I
[1:28:38] sin and done what is evil in your
[1:28:41] sight David saw his sin primarily as an
[1:28:45] AFR or offense to
[1:28:47] [Applause]
[1:28:51] Holy
[1:28:52] H when we are
[1:28:55] convicted we become intensely aware of
[1:28:59] the Wrath it exposes to our

[1:29:09] God working I think it is oh yeah so
[1:29:14] listen to me
[1:29:16] church when we are

[1:29:22] the Wrath it exposes to our
[1:29:31] souls that it exposes to our
[1:29:39] souls are you following me now when the
[1:29:43] Philippian jail fell at the apostles
[1:29:45] feet and he cried says what must I do to
[1:29:48] be
[1:29:50] safe
[1:29:56] he was under
[1:29:57] conviction he was certain that without a
[1:30:00] savior he would
[1:30:04] die when the Holy Ghost convicts people
[1:30:07] of their
[1:30:08] sin he represents the righteous Judgment
[1:30:12] of
[1:30:15] God there is no appeal of the
[1:30:19] verdict you feel oh I am undone
[1:30:23] isah said
[1:30:25] me said ohed man
[1:30:29] I said let me Len to me when you receive
[1:30:33] conviction feel is done
[1:30:37] you rightous judge and you need
[1:30:43] Grace the Holy Spirit not only convict
[1:30:46] people of
[1:30:48] sin but he also brings them to
[1:30:50] repentance
[1:30:54] when you are convicted by the Holy Ghost
[1:30:56] of
[1:30:57] sin he brings you to
[1:31:00] repentance
[1:31:02] Hallelujah if you being a
[1:31:05] liar a good
[1:31:07] liar
[1:31:09] liar the day you are convicted about
[1:31:13] it you will repent of
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:20] it you turn around from
[1:31:24] sin you turn you give it your
[1:31:28] back you can never do that thing
[1:31:31] again because you hate it from the
[1:31:34] bottom of your soul
[1:31:36] soul you
[1:31:38] repent repentance means to turn around
[1:31:41] to
[1:31:45] it the convicting power of the holy
[1:31:48] spirit opens our eyes to our sin
[1:31:55] and opens our hearts to receive God's
[1:32:00] grace if someone is convicted of
[1:32:04] sin even if they have been a
[1:32:06] murderer they will accept God's
[1:32:11] grace why because they will understand
[1:32:16] it's not a physical thing talking about
[1:32:19] a spiritual thing
[1:32:20] here done by the power of the Holy
[1:32:23] Spirit if you had
[1:32:26] hatred I can preach about against hatred
[1:32:29] here on
[1:32:30] theit but if you're not convicted in
[1:32:33] your
[1:32:34] soul you will go right on and
[1:32:36] still and God will not and you will not
[1:32:39] receive the Revelation about
[1:32:41] it but when God convicts you of it he
[1:32:45] will begin to show you everybody that
[1:32:47] you've been
[1:32:49] hating and from that moment
[1:32:52] you will
[1:32:53] repent from that moment they'll become
[1:32:56] your friends from that moment you will
[1:33:00] say I forgive them if you have to call
[1:33:02] them up you will call them up if you
[1:33:05] have to F them you will F them whatever
[1:33:08] you need to do you will do it because
[1:33:10] the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you what
[1:33:12] you need to put
[1:33:14] right repentance and conviction is a
[1:33:16] work of the holy
[1:33:18] spirit it's not something you work up
[1:33:22] it's not something a push to do it is
[1:33:25] something the Holy Spirit reveals to
[1:33:28] you if you have been doing rumor
[1:33:32] mongering you know you will not realize
[1:33:35] is
[1:33:36] wrong when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:33:39] down amen and he makes it known to
[1:33:43] you he will just repent of
[1:33:46] it it will no longer be a part of your
[1:33:50] life we praise the Lord for the
[1:33:53] conviction of
[1:33:55] sin without it there could be no
[1:33:59] salvation no one is saved apart from the
[1:34:02] spirit is convicting and regenerating
[1:34:05] work in the
[1:34:12] heart the Bible teaches that all people
[1:34:14] are by Nature Rebels against
[1:34:20] God we dead in our
[1:34:24] trespass Jesus said no one can come to
[1:34:26] me unless the father has drawn
[1:34:31] him and part of that drawing is to
[1:34:38] convict praise
[1:34:42] God and today I took my time to explain
[1:34:45] what conviction
[1:34:47] is I want to say we all need a
[1:34:50] conviction
[1:34:53] whereby you will be convicted of
[1:34:55] sin and repent of your sin not just be a
[1:34:59] church member and the Rapture happens
[1:35:00] and you remain
[1:35:03] here this is one of the reasons why
[1:35:05] people will not go in the
[1:35:08] Rapture because they are not
[1:35:12] saved you cannot be saved without
[1:35:16] conviction you just the blame games all
[1:35:19] the
[1:35:20] time you feel like your condition is
[1:35:22] that way because of somebody's something
[1:35:24] that have
[1:35:27] done but says the message believest thou
[1:35:32] this when your pastor prays for
[1:35:35] you you say well he must not be a man of
[1:35:37] God would have his
[1:35:46] prayer have heard his prayer why did I
[1:35:49] get healed and then brother says what
[1:35:51] about your
[1:35:52] faith it is your faith that touches
[1:35:56] God not all together his
[1:36:00] prayer you are obeying God's
[1:36:03] word and when you obey God's
[1:36:06] word is under obligation to answer
[1:36:11] you if you believe him it lays in
[1:36:16] you don't blame the other
[1:36:19] man don't blame the other man
[1:36:23] oh if the pastor was a man of God God
[1:36:26] would have answered his
[1:36:30] prayer oh I think even the problem is
[1:36:32] our
[1:36:33] church don't enough or
[1:36:37] maybe we don't sing
[1:36:39] enough preach well
[1:36:42] enough
[1:36:44] listen you don't need to do blame
[1:36:49] games God
[1:36:52] what we need is a conviction of
[1:36:56] sin
[1:36:59] Hallelujah in the message God provided
[1:37:01] way brother bam
[1:37:04] says then how can you blame
[1:37:08] God you
[1:37:10] can't some of you blame
[1:37:12] God oh is God who has brought me in this
[1:37:17] B imagine Eve and Adam right there the
[1:37:19] thickest blaming
[1:37:25] oh let
[1:37:29] Theon I want to imagine
[1:37:31] it
[1:37:34] Hallelujah them blaming
[1:37:41] God think about it
[1:37:44] oh you can't blame
[1:37:47] godam says our Prophet says you
[1:37:50] can't
[1:37:51] tell your neighbor you
[1:37:55] can't you have got to blame
[1:38:00] yourself there is not a bit of need of
[1:38:03] anyone going to hell when God has made a
[1:38:06] provided way of
[1:38:12] Escape you can't help being a
[1:38:17] sinner you can't help that you you were
[1:38:21] bornn a
[1:38:22] sinner but you can help staying a
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:47] sinner the body pushing me this
[1:38:50] right
[1:38:52] but you don't suppos to stay like that
[1:38:54] you can help staying a
[1:39:02] sinner meaning you can change if you
[1:39:04] want
[1:39:05] to if you can accept Jesus as your in
[1:39:09] your
[1:39:11] place he was made sin for
[1:39:13] you God is way of
[1:39:17] Escape then you don't have to be a
[1:39:20] sinner you will be a Christian and
[1:39:22] you'll be
[1:39:24] holy not your own
[1:39:26] Holiness but his Holiness not what you
[1:39:29] are but what God has done for you
[1:39:33] Jesus your own ways you you you can quit
[1:39:37] lying you can quit
[1:39:39] stealing you can quit
[1:39:41] smoking that doesn't mean you are
[1:39:50] saved
[1:39:52] you cannot bypass a
[1:40:01] conviction
[1:40:03] Hallelujah the Bible does not
[1:40:06] say that is coming back for people who
[1:40:09] don't do bad
[1:40:13] things but he said he's coming back for
[1:40:17] those that are
[1:40:19] saved but you cannot be
[1:40:23] saved unless you receive a conviction
[1:40:27] of you can and when you receive the
[1:40:29] conviction of
[1:40:31] sin it will bring through
[1:40:36] repentance
[1:40:39] repentance will bring true
[1:40:44] salvation so you are saved because God
[1:40:47] ordained that you should be
[1:40:49] saved
[1:40:51] and he called your
[1:40:53] heart that's why you are saved no man
[1:40:56] can come to the father except bys
[1:41:01] him and he has made a way of Escape
[1:41:04] now how does he draw
[1:41:07] Us by a
[1:41:11] conviction praise
[1:41:13] God one
[1:41:15] day as a young
[1:41:17] person think about 19 or 17 years
[1:41:23] I was saved I
[1:41:25] thought but there things that I still
[1:41:29] did and um you know I uh I was watching
[1:41:33] this this kind of
[1:41:36] movies and um you know it is something
[1:41:39] that was a part of my
[1:41:41] life and I could not break out of it and
[1:41:45] I I had a pile of
[1:41:49] them as young person you know whatever
[1:41:53] you a young person would like
[1:41:55] watching is what I was fisting
[1:41:58] on and I had and I'm speaking this
[1:42:01] publicly because I'm giving a testimony
[1:42:03] maybe it will help
[1:42:05] someone and I had a pile of all these
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:09] videos my pastor never knew no one knew
[1:42:14] I was preaching at the time but no one
[1:42:17] knew that I was still
[1:42:19] bound so a person can even preach and
[1:42:22] still go to
[1:42:24] hell if you don't receive a
[1:42:27] conviction you can be a minister and go
[1:42:29] to
[1:42:34] hell if you don't receive a
[1:42:37] conviction and I know we say that hell
[1:42:40] is not made for us and things like
[1:42:44] that that is a sermon for another
[1:42:47] day but this is what God has LA on my
[1:42:49] heart for
[1:42:53] and that day I
[1:42:55] remember I was in another
[1:42:59] country I had gone for missionary
[1:43:01] work in
[1:43:03] Zimbabwe I never forget that
[1:43:06] day and I'm saying this I have a witness
[1:43:10] right
[1:43:11] here I had left Brother Martin in my
[1:43:16] house to keep my house for
[1:43:19] me both of us were not
[1:43:21] married and so while in
[1:43:24] Zimbabwe I had all those piles of of CDs
[1:43:27] you know hidden away is in a stock
[1:43:30] somewhere under my
[1:43:34] bed no one no one knew that I
[1:43:37] had and so and and then while in
[1:43:42] Zimbabwe I
[1:43:44] uh we had service after
[1:43:48] service and one day
[1:43:51] the Holy
[1:43:54] Spirit the holy spirit is
[1:43:59] real the Holy Spirit came
[1:44:04] down
[1:44:07] and he started convincing
[1:44:11] me speaking to
[1:44:14] me no one was there I was all by
[1:44:19] myself and he started telling me this is
[1:44:23] wrong that is wrong this is wrong and I
[1:44:27] explained he said no that is wrong wrong
[1:44:32] because it brings this and does this and
[1:44:34] does this in your
[1:44:36] life explained everything and why
[1:44:39] certain things were in the way they were
[1:44:41] in my life at the
[1:44:44] time I tried to explain myself to
[1:44:48] him but friends he convinced me
[1:44:52] me and I broke
[1:44:55] down and I started
[1:44:58] repenting with bitter
[1:45:01] tears Lord please forgive me forgive me
[1:45:06] for what I've
[1:45:07] done forgive me for my life that has not
[1:45:09] been
[1:45:11] right and when I got off off my knees I
[1:45:15] called Brother Martin
[1:45:17] immediately I told him Brother Martin
[1:45:19] listen to me carefully
[1:45:22] I told him go under my
[1:45:25] bed there's a stock of some
[1:45:29] CS please find them I don't know what
[1:45:32] you want to do with
[1:45:34] them if you want to bur them or
[1:45:37] break destroy it
[1:45:40] all and I went off the
[1:45:43] [Music]
[1:45:45] phone that is a
[1:45:49] conviction and I
[1:45:51] never went back to those
[1:45:56] things
[1:45:58] never I was
[1:46:01] delivered never watch pornography
[1:46:06] again from that moment I never did
[1:46:10] again I got
[1:46:12] delivered let me tell you young people
[1:46:15] the holy spirit is
[1:46:18] real he can con
[1:46:21] you and speak to
[1:46:23] you on and convince
[1:46:27] you there is no reason of you being a
[1:46:29] Believer being in church when you are
[1:46:35] bound let experience the power of the
[1:46:38] Holy
[1:46:41] Spirit when you experience him you will
[1:46:44] never go back to those things
[1:46:49] again
[1:46:51] your lying will
[1:46:53] die your cheating will
[1:46:56] die your desires for pornography will
[1:47:01] die you will be born
[1:47:04] again the new birth is
[1:47:08] real and if you don't receive
[1:47:11] it you will not go in the
[1:47:14] Rapture and the time is running
[1:47:18] fast playing music is not
[1:47:22] enough preaching is not
[1:47:24] enough calling yourself a Believer is
[1:47:27] not
[1:47:29] enough even fasting for the whole day
[1:47:32] and praying for the old day is not
[1:47:35] enough to come to a place of
[1:47:40] conviction and you cannot come to that
[1:47:42] place unless you have amen presented
[1:47:44] yourself into the presence of the word
[1:47:46] of
[1:47:49] God evening services on
[1:47:53] Wednesday you start going
[1:47:57] late because we were watching a
[1:48:00] program one day we almost missed
[1:48:04] church because we had a
[1:48:07] program it is so
[1:48:10] cunning it happens so
[1:48:14] fast you don't feel it or plan for
[1:48:18] it even when you think
[1:48:25] spiritual and
[1:48:27] so I
[1:48:29] subscribed for that
[1:48:32] month and I traveled on a mission trip
[1:48:35] to
[1:48:36] Ethiopia was one of our first mission
[1:48:38] trips
[1:48:41] there and
[1:48:43] so while there I was with brother
[1:48:47] Paul and we were in this room
[1:48:51] and we started
[1:48:52] praying we prayed it was a good
[1:48:55] atmosphere
[1:48:57] pray and
[1:48:59] uh I I think um we prayed together until
[1:49:03] brother Paul slept
[1:49:06] off but something happened to
[1:49:09] me stop
[1:49:11] praying I continued praying tears were
[1:49:14] all over the
[1:49:15] floor and the the floor was cold but I
[1:49:18] couldn't feel the coldness any
[1:49:22] and I was just lying down beside the
[1:49:26] bed on the
[1:49:29] floor and uh at that
[1:49:32] moment the Holy Spirit started speaking
[1:49:35] to
[1:49:36] me convincing
[1:49:38] me that what I the decision I made to
[1:49:42] bring that ke in my
[1:49:49] home he gave me many reasons told me a
[1:49:52] lot of things revealed me a lot of
[1:49:56] things I can't explain
[1:49:59] it but I think and I believe that that
[1:50:03] is
[1:50:05] conviction and I I by the time I came
[1:50:07] out of that prayer I had
[1:50:10] repented and I made up my
[1:50:13] mind that when cuz now the next point
[1:50:15] was how am I going to talk to my
[1:50:19] wife
[1:50:20] because both of myself and and her were
[1:50:23] now glued to
[1:50:25] this and I didn't want to have problems
[1:50:28] in my
[1:50:30] marriage and so I uh I I just sprayed it
[1:50:34] away and I but I made up my mind I'm
[1:50:37] going to go back home and tell her what
[1:50:39] God dealt with me the experience I
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:43] had and together if she agrees with me
[1:50:46] we would remove the
[1:50:49] dish
[1:50:50] and so when I arrived home I think it
[1:50:52] was about 2 weeks
[1:50:54] later I found that the C
[1:51:00] disconnected and I had left her with her
[1:51:04] young
[1:51:07] sister sister Anna and then I found that
[1:51:10] the cables were
[1:51:12] disconnected and there was only the
[1:51:14] screen and the dis was still up
[1:51:17] there and so I said why the was
[1:51:21] disconnected she
[1:51:23] said and when she told me the
[1:51:26] time it was at exactly the same time God
[1:51:29] was dealing with
[1:51:32] me God dealt with
[1:51:35] them while they were
[1:51:37] praying God convicted
[1:51:41] them to quit this
[1:51:43] thing and that she did not know how she
[1:51:46] would talk to
[1:51:48] me convince
[1:51:51] me to remove it away
[1:51:54] from let me tell you when the Holy
[1:51:57] Spirit comes we don't need to convince
[1:52:00] people to live
[1:52:03] things that's why
[1:52:05] me I learned the hard
[1:52:08] way that I am a pastor but I'm not the
[1:52:11] Holy
[1:52:14] Spirit some pastors follow up
[1:52:18] people what they doing
[1:52:21] what they have in their
[1:52:24] house no I don't do that because I've
[1:52:27] learned their
[1:52:29] hard if we preach the right
[1:52:32] message the Holy Spirit should convict
[1:52:37] you and convince you of
[1:52:42] sin and God came
[1:52:45] down I didn't have to convince my
[1:52:48] wife didn't have to convince me the Holy
[1:52:52] Spirit had done
[1:52:54] convince I called the man quickly he
[1:52:56] came he removed
[1:52:58] it and from that time we've never had in
[1:53:02] our
[1:53:05] home I can't imagine what my home would
[1:53:09] have been with that and these little
[1:53:15] children it is literally raising this
[1:53:18] generation
[1:53:21] all the bad stuff children are learning
[1:53:23] from
[1:53:25] TV you know the filthy things they
[1:53:27] learning from
[1:53:29] TV and they're bringing it in the
[1:53:34] society our government
[1:53:37] today is making
[1:53:39] laws against
[1:53:42] LGBT but they can't stop
[1:53:45] it it's a spirit and it's being
[1:53:48] transferred through this
[1:53:50] channels through these movies that the
[1:53:53] young people are
[1:53:54] watching through the
[1:53:56] televisions let me tell you there's only
[1:53:58] one thing that is going to stop people
[1:53:59] from
[1:54:01] sin is the conviction of the Holy
[1:54:05] Spirit and that's what you
[1:54:07] need that is what I need that's what we
[1:54:10] all
[1:54:11] need and allow me to read this qu as I
[1:54:15] close the message Jehovah
[1:54:17] Gyra he says now I don't condemn Sinners
[1:54:20] for the way they
[1:54:23] live that is all they know and I feel
[1:54:25] sorry for
[1:54:27] them I don't blame a sinner from going
[1:54:30] out and getting
[1:54:33] drunk that is all the pleasure he
[1:54:35] has give him another
[1:54:38] one I don't
[1:54:42] blame I don't blame him from gambling
[1:54:45] going to
[1:54:47] places Hony tongs and that's all the
[1:54:49] pleasure he
[1:54:51] got I don't blame a pig for eating out
[1:54:55] of man
[1:54:59] P that's all he
[1:55:02] [Music]

[1:56:42] to see a lamb go to dinner with a
[1:56:48] pig
