[0:00] what I spoke on on
[0:03] [Music]
[0:06] Sunday and I'm also ministering to the
[0:09] Saints uh in evening light uh bright
[0:15] Tabernacle evening late
[0:19] tacle
[0:21] so uh for their service this evening on
[0:27] Zoom so I'll greet them in a moment
[0:35] praise the
[0:36] Lord are you happy to be in the house of
[0:38] the
[0:40] Lord
[0:43] amen David said I was happy when they
[0:45] said to me let's go to the house of the
[0:51] Lord
[0:53] amen
[0:56] so tonight we are reading once again
[0:59] from from Malachi 4:
[1:04] [Music]
[1:13] 5 and
[1:15] then we will read other scriptures later
[1:21] on behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:24] prophet before the coming of the Great
[1:26] and the Dreadful day of the
[1:28] Lord
[1:37] amen amen you may be
[1:41] seated so I send our greetings uh to
[1:45] evening by
[1:48] Tabernacle
[1:51] brother asked me to speak to the Saints
[1:54] here on Zoom so the saints that are
[1:55] streaming this on Zoom I send you our
[1:58] regards
[2:03] in the name of Jesus
[2:05] Christ so we are speaking on the
[2:07] ministry of Elijah in the end
[2:10] [Music]
[2:12] time um there is a lot uh to speak on
[2:16] this
[2:18] subject So within one hour you can
[2:21] imagine that uh I would just be hinting
[2:24] on a few things here and
[2:28] there sometimes I have uh quotes to read
[2:31] and then I end up not reading
[2:36] them but uh we just ask that the holy
[2:38] spirit will lead us
[2:42] tonight we have received an Elijah
[2:46] Ministry in our time and this ministry
[2:51] has turned our
[2:53] hearts back to the Faith of Our
[2:57] Fathers and um
[3:00] but you notice that
[3:02] Elijah did not just or will is not just
[3:06] coming in the end
[3:09] time the ministry of Elijah has really
[3:11] been there even before our
[3:17] time the ministry of Elijah has been in
[3:21] the in the Old
[3:22] [Music]
[3:25] Testament and it was prophesied to come
[3:28] again in the end
[3:32] time the prophecy which I read here in
[3:34] the Book of Malachi chapter
[3:38] 4 is just a a prophecy after the
[3:42] ministry of Elijah has existed
[3:45] [Music]
[3:48] twice because the first Ministry of
[3:51] Elijah is seen in the man himself
[3:57] Elijah and that was we will be able to
[4:01] look at it briefly
[4:03] today in the book of First Kings 18
[4:06] shortly we shall read
[4:09] there but we also see that when Elijah
[4:15] left his ministry
[4:18] continued in another man called
[4:21] elishah the anointing that was on the
[4:25] ministry of Elijah or the anointing
[4:27] which was upon Elijah
[4:32] came back in a double portion upon
[4:36] Elisha and Elijah's Ministry if you read
[4:40] your Bible you will find it has many
[4:42] similarities with the ministry of
[4:50] Elijah because the ministry of Elisha
[4:53] was the continuation of the ministry of
[4:58] Elijah so now after Elisha after Elijah
[5:02] and after
[5:05] Elisha now God through another Prophet
[5:11] Malachi he gives a
[5:13] prophecy he says behold I'll send you
[5:16] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[5:18] the Great and the Dreadful day of the
[5:21] [Music]
[5:23] Lord so in other words that the the
[5:27] ministry of Elijah is in continuity
[5:32] here now you have to understand that the
[5:35] man Elijah was
[5:39] one and he did not
[5:41] die he went to heaven
[5:44] alive and and you know but his
[5:48] Spirit oh let me put it this way the
[5:51] spirit of God which was working upon
[5:56] Him continued
[5:58] working now if you see if you you study
[6:02] prophets you can study Daniel you can
[6:05] study Isaiah you can study you know
[6:07] Ezekiel and many other
[6:11] prophets you will notice that their
[6:13] Ministry was a bit
[6:19] varing for example the ministry of uh of
[6:24] Moses was that kind that would turn
[6:28] water into blood
[6:32] you know it was
[6:34] sent to
[6:36] force
[6:38] pharaoh to let the people
[6:42] go but you see the ministry of Elijah is
[6:46] different and by the way in all the Old
[6:50] Testament the ministry of Elijah was
[6:52] very
[6:54] special from all the other
[6:57] prophets if you find you know go God
[7:00] loved or wanted to use the ministry
[7:02] [Music]
[7:04] again and he he uses it for a work of
[7:11] restoration so I want us to look at
[7:13] First Kings
[7:16] 18 and we will begin from verse
[7:21] 19 praise the
[7:28] Lord
[7:30] now the there are quite very many verses
[7:32] but
[7:34] uh we will try and and see how much we
[7:37] can read for
[7:41] you now therefore send and gather to me
[7:44] all Israel unto Mount camel and the
[7:46] prophets of Bal 450 and the prophets of
[7:49] the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's
[7:52] table so Ahab sent unto all the children
[7:55] of Israel and gathered the prophets
[7:57] together unto Mount camel
[7:59] we are reading from verse 19 chapter
[8:28] 18 came
[8:32] unto please and Elijah came unto all the
[8:34] people and said how long hold ye between
[8:37] two opinions if the Lord be God follow
[8:41] him but if Bal then follow him and the
[8:44] people answered him not a word then said
[8:46] Elijah unto the people I even I only
[8:49] remain a prophet of the Lord but B's
[8:51] prophets are 450
[8:58] men
[9:02] [Music]
[9:21] let them there forgive us to blocks and
[9:23] let them choose one block for themselves
[9:25] and cut in pieces and lay it on wood and
[9:28] put no fire under and I will dress the
[9:30] other bulock and lay it on wood and put
[9:32] no fire under and call ye on the name of
[9:34] your gods and I will call on the name of
[9:36] the Lord and the God thatth by fire let
[9:39] him be God and all the people answered
[9:40] and said it is well
[9:58] spoken
[10:16] and Elijah said unto the prophets of Bal
[10:18] choose you uh one block for yourselves
[10:22] and dress it first for ye are for ye are
[10:24] many and call on the name of your Gods
[10:27] put no fire under and they took the
[10:29] bulock which was given them and they
[10:31] dressed it and called on the name of Bal
[10:34] from morning even until noon saying oh
[10:37] Bal hear us but there was no voice nor
[10:41] any that s answered and they leaped upon
[10:43] the altar which was made and it came to
[10:45] pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and
[10:47] said cry aloud for he's a God either
[10:50] he's talking or he's pursuing or he's in
[10:52] a journey or per Adventure he sleepeth
[10:55] and and must be
[10:58] awake
[11:18] [Music]
[11:27] for
[11:48] and they cried aloud and cut themselves
[11:50] after their manner with knives and
[11:52] Lancet till the blood gashed out upon
[11:54] them and it came to pass when the when
[11:57] the when midday was passed and they
[11:59] prophesied until the time of the
[12:00] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[12:02] there was neither voice nor any to
[12:04] answer nor any that
[12:27] regarded
[12:29] [Music]
[12:32] praise the name of the Lord now Saints I
[12:35] want you to uh uh to to follow me
[12:37] closely
[12:39] here sometimes you think that these
[12:41] things we've gone through it many times
[12:43] and you know you already know
[12:47] them but I I know that the word of God
[12:50] is always
[12:51] new and and I want you to follow me
[12:54] closely so that you can be able to
[12:57] understand
[13:00] you see this sounds like a very good
[13:04] story but this is more than a
[13:07] story if I was to take time I would
[13:10] almost preach to you on every verse for
[13:13] a
[13:15] [Music]
[13:17] while but you know it has a deeper
[13:22] meaning I want you to see the time that
[13:25] God sent Elijah to Israel
[13:30] you
[13:31] know this was a time when Israel had
[13:36] backen Elijah came at the time when
[13:38] Israel was
[13:41] backen and the glory of God had departed
[13:44] from
[13:45] Israel so King Ahab married from the
[13:49] among the
[13:51] heathens and in shortly we are going to
[13:53] look at that more a little
[13:56] more but now you know
[13:59] Jezebel started fighting against Ahab
[14:03] rather started fighting against
[14:07] Elijah and maybe I'm thinking for a
[14:10] little more Foundation I should give you
[14:12] a little more scriptures here for you to
[14:13] look
[14:18] at uh I've not finished the reading in
[14:21] uh First Kings
[14:25] 18 but if I don't go back please you
[14:27] could note it down and then read it
[14:31] later so the whole thing begins with
[14:34] ahab's
[14:38] marriage and I want you to look at it in
[14:40] chapter 16 verse
[14:42] [Music]
[14:45] 31 and it came to pass as if it had been
[14:48] a light thing for him to walk in the
[14:50] sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that
[14:53] he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of
[14:56] ethal King of the zidonians and went and
[14:59] served B and worshiped
[15:10] [Music]
[15:19] him you know let me tell you there is
[15:22] something that God
[15:25] cherishes and that is his word and the
[15:28] word of God does not
[15:30] change season after
[15:33] season man changes but the word of God
[15:35] does not
[15:36] [Music]
[15:37] change if you walk in the word of God
[15:41] you are going to reap the blessings of
[15:42] the
[15:44] world but if you don't walk in the word
[15:48] there is also a curse so you see
[15:51] whenever you open the word whenever you
[15:52] open the
[15:54] Bible it has two things it has a
[15:57] blessing and it has has a
[15:59] cur it has a blessing if you walk in
[16:02] it it has a cur if you don't walk in
[16:06] it and you know we can know that by
[16:09] seeing the church the the church
[16:13] natural Israel is the church
[16:16] natural and we've seen that Israel God
[16:19] dealt with Israel as a as a nation as a
[16:23] group God deals with with uh with the
[16:27] Gentiles as
[16:31] individuals so everything that happens
[16:33] to Israel as a church as a
[16:37] nation it happens to us Gentiles as
[16:42] individuals so while I look at Israel as
[16:45] a
[16:46] nation I want you to examine your own
[16:49] personal life as an
[16:52] individual so now everything begins with
[16:57] Ahab before sends
[16:59] Elijah things begin with
[17:02] Ahab you know the Bible says Ahab you
[17:06] know he had seen it as a light thing as
[17:09] a simple
[17:12] thing to walk in the sins of jeroboam
[17:15] the son of
[17:17] [Music]
[17:19] of but now before we look at
[17:22] jeroboam I want you to look
[17:25] at but before you look atam
[17:29] I want you to look at
[17:30] Solomon and before we look at Solomon I
[17:34] want you to look at David the whole
[17:36] thing begins there David the Bible says
[17:39] he was a man after God's Own
[17:43] Heart whatever God said David said amen
[17:46] I believe
[17:48] it David worked in the will of
[17:52] godid did what God
[17:55] desired yes David was not a perfect man
[17:59] just like every
[18:01] individual even you who is listening to
[18:03] me today you are not a perfect man some
[18:08] people think that for you to be a
[18:09] believer you need to be a perfect man or
[18:13] woman no otherwise we will not be
[18:17] Believers why are we Believers we are
[18:20] believers in order to become
[18:25] perfect the word which we believe must
[18:29] perfect us it must bring us to full
[18:34] Perfection and that's why we are
[18:36] believers but David being a Son of God
[18:40] being a child of God working according
[18:43] to the statutes of
[18:45] God God loved him and God promised him
[18:50] an everlasting
[18:51] Kingdom he said you know you know he
[18:55] will continue
[18:56] reigning his Lage
[18:59] and so David was blessed before the
[19:02] Lord but then later on he had a
[19:05] son and his name was called
[19:08] Solomon now Solomon was also a good man
[19:13] we know that Solomon actually
[19:15] built the
[19:17] temple you know God told David well you
[19:20] know I love you but you have too much
[19:22] blood on your hands I not allow you to
[19:23] build a
[19:27] temple
[19:29] said but I I will have your sun
[19:32] building because God was looking at that
[19:35] as continuity of David's
[19:40] Kingdom the convenant he had made with
[19:43] David continued on through
[19:47] Solomon let me tell you church when God
[19:50] makes a covenant with you it continues
[19:53] on through your
[19:55] Lage it continues on down to your
[19:58] children
[19:58] children that is why as Believers you
[20:01] always have to
[20:02] claim am every blessing every promise of
[20:07] God that he has promised you it must
[20:10] come down to your
[20:13] Lage amen oh fathers how many fathers do
[20:16] we have here all you fathers all you
[20:19] fathers on Zoom today amen all of you
[20:22] hearing me if you fathers here is a word
[20:25] for you if you have children claim every
[20:29] one of
[20:30] them and you put them under the
[20:33] token none of them can be
[20:36] lost if you believe that with all your
[20:39] heart amen because the promise of
[20:42] God said is unto you and your children
[20:47] and their
[20:49] children that's the promise of God well
[20:52] that that happens also among the
[20:55] Gentiles if it happened to the to to the
[20:59] Jews and so then Solomon built a
[21:03] temple but you see along the
[21:06] way
[21:07] Solomon
[21:09] married he married not a wife but
[21:13] wives he married more wives more wives
[21:17] and he had a lot of
[21:19] women and here is the
[21:21] thing most of these women he married
[21:24] them because of political
[21:27] alliances
[21:31] and uh he thought that he will it will
[21:34] help him to be a strong
[21:38] King if God has called
[21:40] you he has anointed you to be what you
[21:44] are you do not need to go into any
[21:47] alliance with
[21:49] anybody you can accomplish the purpose
[21:52] of God for your life without any
[21:57] Alliance and many times these
[22:00] alliances they bring us trouble with
[22:03] God praise the name of the Lord and so
[22:06] we notice here that then Solomon when he
[22:09] grew old these women they they started
[22:13] to you know bring him closer to the to
[22:16] their
[22:18] gods and he started building
[22:21] altars the same man who built the altar
[22:24] of the
[22:25] Lord he now began to build the altars of
[22:28] these other
[22:30] gods and God was not happy with
[22:34] Solomon and because of that you know he
[22:38] came down when Solomon was about to die
[22:42] he comes down to to to one of the
[22:45] prophets and he told him I'd like you to
[22:48] go and
[22:50] prophesy not to the son of the of the
[22:54] king but to one of the Servants of the
[22:56] king
[22:58] prophesy to him and
[23:00] say praise
[23:02] God that God is going to to reap the
[23:05] kingdom into
[23:08] two and he's going to give you 10
[23:11] tribes and the other one will remain
[23:14] with the
[23:15] two and he will he will remain in in
[23:19] Jerusalem
[23:21] because of my servant
[23:25] David the city of God could not be taken
[23:27] away from from the from the Lage of
[23:32] David because of David not because of
[23:38] Solomon the way you serve God can end up
[23:41] blessing your
[23:46] children there are certain things you
[23:48] are
[23:49] fighting am I preaching to someone here
[23:51] today there are certain things you are
[23:53] fighting in your
[23:55] life listen listen those things that you
[23:58] are
[23:59] fighting if you don't overcome them it
[24:02] will be passed down to your
[24:06] children but if you fight them and
[24:10] overcome them that will be the end of
[24:13] them that will be the end of it so let
[24:17] me tell you as Believers we ought to
[24:20] fight a good fight of
[24:23] faith and refuse anything that is bad to
[24:27] go down Our
[24:32] Generation so that you would tell
[24:35] yourself I know myself I'm going to
[24:38] fight with this demon I'm going to fight
[24:41] with this spirit I will not allow it to
[24:44] cross it must die with
[24:47] me
[24:48] yes but the problem
[24:51] here
[24:53] Solomon received and reaped the
[24:55] blessings of his father
[24:57] [Music]
[24:59] but he was not able to keep
[25:03] them he went and served other
[25:06] God and when that happened God was not
[25:09] happy with him he said now I'm going to
[25:12] take the
[25:13] kingdom and I will give the biggest
[25:16] part to the servant of
[25:19] Solomon so that he can rule as he
[25:25] wishes God is God that's what
[25:32] desires
[25:33] listen so now um if you can go with me
[25:37] to the book of First Kings chapter
[25:41] 11 let us see this
[25:44] prophecy quickly now vers
[25:49] 29 and it came to pass at that time when
[25:52] jeroboam went out to Jerusalem that the
[25:54] prophet aijah the shilonite found him in
[25:57] the way and he had CED himself with a
[25:59] new garment and they too were alone in
[26:01] the field and a c the new garment that
[26:04] was on him and he rent it in 12 uh
[26:08] pieces and he said to jeroboam take the
[26:11] 10 that were uh the pieces for thus say
[26:14] the Lord for God the god of Israel
[26:16] behold I I I will re the kingdom out of
[26:19] the hand of Solomon and I will give you
[26:22] 10 tribes but he but he shall have one
[26:26] tribe for my servant David's sake and
[26:29] for Jerusalem's sake the city which I
[26:31] have chosen out of all the tribes of
[26:32] Israel because that they have forsaken
[26:35] me and I have worshiped and have woried
[26:37] asth and uh the goddess of the zidonians
[26:42] Kos the god of the moabites and milcom
[26:45] the god of the children of Ammon and
[26:47] have not walked in my ways to do that
[26:50] which is in right in my eyes and to keep
[26:54] my statutes and my judgments as did
[26:56] David his father how bit I will not take
[26:59] the whole Kingdom out of his hand and I
[27:01] will make him Prince all the days of his
[27:04] life for David my servant's sake whom I
[27:06] I chose because he kept my Commandments
[27:09] and my statutes but I will take the
[27:11] kingdom out of his son's hand and I will
[27:14] give it unto thee even 10 tribes and
[27:17] unto his son will I give one tribe that
[27:20] David my servant may have a light uh all
[27:24] way before me in Jerusalem the city
[27:26] which I have chosen to me to put my name
[27:28] there I will take thee and thou shal
[27:31] Reign AC according to all that thy soul
[27:34] desireth and shalt be king over Israel
[27:37] and it shall be if thou Willl hecken
[27:39] unto listen listen to this part now and
[27:42] it shall be verse 38 and it shall be if
[27:45] thou Willl hecken unto all that I
[27:48] command thee and will walk in my ways
[27:51] and do that which is right in my sight
[27:54] to keep my statutes and my Commandments
[27:57] as David my servant did that I will be
[27:59] with you and build the a sure house as I
[28:03] build for David and I will give Israel
[28:06] unto you oh my God praise God I want you
[28:09] to hear
[28:10] this this is a powerful
[28:13] promise you know God was let me tell you
[28:16] if there is something that God
[28:19] loves is someone who will stay with the
[28:24] word someone who who who has the ability
[28:28] to stand with the
[28:31] word in the face of
[28:33] anything in the face of every
[28:36] Temptation you stay with the
[28:39] word God loves such a
[28:41] person God loves such a
[28:44] man imagine he gave a promise to David
[28:48] and he said David I've given you an
[28:50] everlasting
[28:51] Kingdom I've even given
[28:53] Jerusalem it's a holy city but you see
[28:57] because because of
[28:58] Solomon Solomon carries the the legacy
[29:01] of his
[29:02] father but because he went to other
[29:06] gods God was not happy with him he now
[29:11] sent Prophet
[29:13] aijah to go and prophesy to a servant
[29:16] called
[29:19] jeroboam jeroboam was only a
[29:23] servant someone who did not even have
[29:26] any claim on on
[29:29] royalty someone who never dreamed of
[29:32] being a
[29:34] king someone who never thought would
[29:36] ever be
[29:39] anything that is the same way God
[29:41] blesses the
[29:44] Gentiles when you never thought you
[29:46] would be
[29:47] anything God gives you an Everlasting
[29:51] Covenant yes we have a big promise
[29:55] here it can be accomplished
[29:59] it will be accomplished it cannot
[30:02] fail but there is a
[30:05] condition God gives a condition
[30:09] to he says yes you know he had a new
[30:14] garment so this Prophet comes and he
[30:18] tears this garment imagine a prophet
[30:21] coming down and he he begins taking your
[30:24] new suit and cutting it into 12
[30:30] some of you can box
[30:31] him what are you doing but God works in
[30:35] ways we don't know but as long as it is
[30:39] God praise God say because people shout
[30:41] and dance
[30:43] and they feel offended the holy spirit
[30:46] is not
[30:48] emotional but the holy spirit is
[30:51] emotional whenever he moves on
[30:54] somebody he does things in an emotional
[30:57] way
[30:59] that's why our Prophet said anything
[31:00] without emotion is
[31:03] dead so you find this prophet he was
[31:06] moved by the Holy Ghost and he goes down
[31:09] to this man
[31:12] jeroboam and he takes his clothes and he
[31:15] begins tearing it tearing it into 12
[31:20] pieces and he gives him 10 pieces and he
[31:24] tells
[31:26] him sayth the
[31:28] Lord God has divided the Kingdom of
[31:33] Israel and he has given you
[31:35] 10 10 tribes 10 of them they are yours
[31:41] this man must have gone crazy at
[31:43] that
[31:45] hallelujah what has happened yes God has
[31:50] given you 10 and here is what really
[31:53] touched my
[31:55] heart he told him
[31:58] you
[31:58] see but for for
[32:04] Solomon One Tribe will be given
[32:08] him and he will remain with a
[32:11] City
[32:13] Jerusalem because that one was
[32:16] chosen it was a chosen city of
[32:20] God and because of David my
[32:25] servant it will remain his
[32:28] lineage I want to say this God does not
[32:31] remember does not
[32:34] forget God always
[32:36] remembers every promise he
[32:39] makes when he made a promise to
[32:43] David he did not forget it has God given
[32:46] you any
[32:48] promise I want to say he cannot
[32:52] forget he cannot forget the
[32:55] promises Hallelujah Hallelujah that he
[32:58] has met to his
[33:00] beloved and so he says but now to the
[33:03] son of
[33:04] Solomon I'll give One Tribe to
[33:07] him
[33:09] because uh I
[33:12] have because of David my
[33:16] servant so God remembers the son of
[33:20] Solomon not because of
[33:22] Solomon but because of
[33:25] David God will remember your children is
[33:28] children because of
[33:31] you if the Lord Jesus studies the
[33:35] decisions you
[33:36] make the stand you make God will
[33:40] remember your children his
[33:44] children because of
[33:50] you because of your
[33:52] stand because of your good
[33:55] decision God will remember the
[33:57] generations after
[34:01] you oh that's a powerful
[34:04] prophecy praise the name of the
[34:07] Lord hallelujah hallelujah and he says
[34:11] and it shall
[34:15] be and then he says here and I will take
[34:18] you
[34:20] job and you will
[34:23] re
[34:25] according to all that your soul
[34:32] desires and you will be king over
[34:36] Israel when you are given a
[34:39] promise God gives you
[34:42] Liberty the Bible says where the spirit
[34:45] of God
[34:46] is there is
[34:51] Liberty hallelujah amen when God gives
[34:54] us all the Redemptive promises in the
[35:00] Le it's up to you to enjoy them the way

[35:31] fullest as long as you stay within the

[35:43] requires of you stay within the world
[35:46] don't go out of the world stay within

[35:52] world so he tells job God is giving you

[39:16] yourself as an
[39:18] individual he says I if you do this then
[39:21] I will be with
[39:24] you he didn't say if you will feel
[39:27] me but he said I will be with
[39:30] you if you walk in my ways if you keep
[39:34] my word I will be with you and about
[39:38] upon this I can now say
[39:41] like amen I will fear no

[39:54] with me regardless of my feeling the
[39:58] Lord is with me regardless of what the

[40:21] I will be with
[40:25] you amen and that's not enough he
[40:28] continues on and he tells
[40:32] jerob and I will build
[40:35] thee a sure
[40:40] house an everlasting
[40:42] Kingdom that's what it
[40:45] means as I build for
[40:49] David my
[40:51] [Music]
[40:53] good the way God gave
[40:58] a promise to
[40:59] David God was ready to give it
[41:05] toob if
[41:07] only could walk in the
[41:10] world only job could walk in the ways of
[41:15] God a sure
[41:19] house and I will give Israel to
[41:23] the mhm what a promise
[41:27] and I want to assure you this is the
[41:30] promise same promise we
[41:32] have God is promising
[41:36] you hallelujah hallelujah God is
[41:39] promising you like he promised David to
[41:43] build a sure house for you to walk with
[41:46] you Amen to be with you to give Israel
[41:50] to you what is Israel Israel means a
[41:54] prince with God
[41:58] that means god is promising you that you
[42:01] will be a royal
[42:03] priesthood that you be
[42:05] royalty God is promising you you will
[42:08] not be a
[42:10] common
[42:11] I I will make you
[42:15] Royal God is saying here I will make you
[42:19] Royal do you know what it means to be
[42:22] royal you cannot be a beggar if you are
[42:25] royal
[42:26] you cannot be sick if you are
[42:28] royal God is promising you victory over
[42:33] every other
[42:35] SE Israel was supposed to be above every
[42:38] Other
[42:40] Nation Israel was supposed to be above
[42:43] all other
[42:44] nations when they went to battle they
[42:46] were never defeated when they went to
[42:49] battle they overcame every
[42:52] battle why because they were
[42:55] Israel they had fought with God and they
[42:58] had
[42:59] prevailed and God is promising
[43:02] job even
[43:04] job without
[43:06] fighting God was ready to take jeroboam
[43:10] and plant him in the
[43:13] promise as long
[43:15] asob accept to stand with a
[43:21] word my good Lord brother sister is the
[43:26] same thing for us as long as we accept
[43:30] brother to walk in the
[43:32] work to walk in the
[43:34] word as long as you
[43:37] accept God is going to do for
[43:39] you like he did for
[43:42] Israel and this was the
[43:44] promise that God gave to
[43:47] jerob but did job keep
[43:54] it is a sad thing
[43:57] I tell
[43:59] you when he was given these words of
[44:02] Prophecy King
[44:05] Solomon knew about it and he he wanted
[44:09] to kill
[44:10] him no one can kill
[44:14] you you can't die before your
[44:18] attack if you have a prophecy of God
[44:20] over
[44:25] you
[44:27] M brother bam said there will be a
[44:33] bride in every
[44:36] nation and the Book of Revelation
[44:40] says there will be
[44:43] Overcomers in every
[44:45] generation that is a prophecy on my
[44:48] head I cannot die until I
[44:54] overcome I cannot
[44:56] perish until I
[44:59] overcome let me tell you if you a bride
[45:02] of Christ can't even allow you to
[45:05] die until you you
[45:08] overcome because he knows when if you
[45:11] die it should be gain for
[45:14] you because you will just wake up for
[45:16] the
[45:18] Rapture so in other words when we die it
[45:22] is not a loss so if a Believer dies
[45:26] thing before the Lord but I'm telling
[45:29] you if you're still fighting you cannot
[45:32] die God can't allow it because you have
[45:35] to overcome the
[45:37] batt hallelujah amen glory to God and
[45:41] see here now Solomon thought he
[45:46] kill but he could not
[45:48] touch was wise now there are some people
[45:53] who who who would be like well if I'm a
[45:58] seed God has prophesied to me by his
[46:02] word I have beli it even if I do what I
[46:06] want to do nothing can touch
[46:10] me
[46:11] job would have done the same she would
[46:14] have
[46:16] said want
[46:18] me I have a prop on
[46:20] me let me sit here let him send his
[46:24] solders see if I will
[46:27] die if if he did that a spear would have
[46:31] gone right through his
[46:34] heart but when heard of it he sneaked
[46:41] out and he ran to
[46:44] Egypt there is something about
[46:47] Egypt even Jesus ran to
[46:51] egyp even
[46:52] Moses there's quite something about
[46:56] and Israel is connected to Egypt is
[46:57] connected to
[47:00] Africa so Africa is a blessed
[47:04] country it's like a place of
[47:07] Refuge a place of
[47:09] [Music]
[47:10] preservation okay we
[47:13] talk
[47:16] now and
[47:18] topt and he
[47:21] himself and he was quiet the whole
[47:24] time King Solomon HED for him and he
[47:26] couldn't
[47:28] find even if you are
[47:30] SE don't go in a
[47:33] bar after all I'm an
[47:36] elect you will die you will
[47:40] perish don't go into bad things when
[47:42] you're
[47:43] know guard your heart stay in the right
[47:47] way stay in the right thing say the word
[47:52] and then you are sure you're
[47:54] safe that prop has to be accomplished
[47:57] the reason why God told you that you are
[47:59] who you are and you know who you are
[48:01] because he has given it to you as a way
[48:03] for you to keep yourself away from other
[48:09] [Music]
[48:12] things and so jeroboam kept himself in
[48:16] Egypt and now Solomon
[48:19] died when King Solomon
[48:22] died Hey listen to me church when King
[48:29] di that
[48:33] now the the King's
[48:37] son was you know now Gathering the
[48:42] people to be crowned as a
[48:45] king came
[48:47] back he said it is time for me to go and
[48:52] possess my
[48:54] prophecy my promise that came to me by
[48:59] prophecy you have to receive a
[49:02] revelation it is
[49:05] time those
[49:07] times of living and wallowing in in
[49:12] sin those times of living in the world
[49:17] over you have to have a revelation it is
[49:20] time it is time for me right now to go
[49:25] claim my
[49:27] place in the word of
[49:30] Prophecy hallelujah amen that's why we
[49:33] are here we have come to claim our
[49:38] position in the word of
[49:41] Prophecy which cannot
[49:44] fail so
[49:46] now he quickly
[49:50] politically to gather
[49:54] people
[49:57] with also the other people
[49:59] heed so they came and brought a
[50:01] proposition to the
[50:03] king they said ah live long
[50:09] King but we have a
[50:12] quest your father treated us this way
[50:17] very
[50:18] hard what about you are you going to
[50:21] reduce the the the
[50:23] treatment and make it better
[50:26] going to be
[50:32] wor went to do
[50:36] consultation so when he went for
[50:40] Cel he first of all went to the elders
[50:45] he said give me Cel what should I tell
[50:48] these
[50:49] young said yeah for you to be able to
[50:51] win their
[50:53] heart don't don't be very strict it on
[50:56] them relax
[50:58] things don't over tax
[51:01] them relax things don't be very strict
[51:06] on and
[51:10] then let me also go to my little
[51:13] buddies and ask them those ones we went
[51:17] we used to go out in the
[51:19] [Music]
[51:20] world you know to do this and that let
[51:24] me go and con
[51:26] you know when you're
[51:27] Consulting you should know who to
[51:29] consult
[51:30] from if you consult from everything and
[51:35] anybody you're going to be
[51:40] confused I preached you on one time on I
[51:42] cancel
[51:44] thee I'm not done with it I'll go back
[51:47] to I cancel the you see if you you're
[51:51] going to get the
[51:52] councel God has a councel for us
[51:56] in our
[51:57] generation he says I cancel thee to buy
[52:00] of me gold tried in the
[52:02] fire gold tried in the fight what is
[52:06] that gold is the word of the
[52:08] hour that comes by Elijah in the end
[52:13] time we'll come to that later so now we
[52:16] see here he received the wrong
[52:19] counsel from the younger buddies they
[52:22] told him ah you squeeze them
[52:26] so he came and he told
[52:28] them now my
[52:32] father's my father's W it says my little
[52:36] finger will be
[52:39] bigger than my father's
[52:43] W meaning I'm going to be much more
[52:48] tougher because the the young man told
[52:51] him if you speak that way they would
[52:54] think you are strong
[52:55] and they will fear you so the moment he
[52:58] said
[53:00] that so it has an
[53:03] opportunity he gathered the people told
[53:05] let's go home yes go home so when they
[53:08] reach went back home follow them and
[53:12] they crowned him as a
[53:13] king of 10
[53:19] tribes Hallelujah so the mistakes of
[53:24] Israel unbelief of
[53:26] Israel what happened God used it so that
[53:31] the Gentile
[53:33] church can come to
[53:36] light the Bible in Romans 11 it says
[53:40] they were
[53:42] blinded for our
[53:48] sake because they were blinded we can
[53:51] see until when until the fullness of the
[53:55] Gentiles be
[53:57] coming it will not come in until the
[54:00] last age comes and the last age we have
[54:04] the end time
[54:05] Elijah with an end time message to
[54:08] restore us back to every word of
[54:13] God oh my God
[54:16] and
[54:19] becomes only a king in
[54:22] Jerusalem as the prophet had
[54:27] and jeroboam became a prophet of 10
[54:32] tribes oh now his Reign
[54:36] started he was so happy he was so happy
[54:40] but here is a mistake
[54:45] did God told him I will be with you like
[54:49] I was with
[54:51] David You Will Rule according to your
[54:54] heart will be king over Israel you will
[54:57] do everything that you like as long as
[55:01] you walk in my way you walk according to
[55:04] my word you walk you obey my
[55:08] Commandments but did he
[55:10] obey that's the
[55:13] question that's the
[55:16] question look at First Kings chapter
[55:19] 14 vers
[55:23] s we'll read just about four four verses
[55:26] from
[55:28] there God tell jeroboam th sayth the
[55:31] Lord God of Israel for as much as I
[55:34] exalted thee from among the people and
[55:37] made thee Prince Over My People Israel
[55:39] and
[55:40] rent the kingdom away from the house of
[55:42] David and gave it to thee and yet thou
[55:45] Hast not been as my servant David who
[55:48] kept my Commandments and who followed me
[55:50] with all his heart to do that only which
[55:54] was right in my eyes but has done evil
[55:57] evil you have done evil above all that
[55:59] is before
[56:01] thee for thou Hast gone and made the
[56:03] other gods and molten images to provoke
[56:06] me to
[56:07] anger and you have cast me behind your
[56:11] back therefore behold I will bring evil
[56:16] upon the house of jeroboam and I will
[56:18] cut off
[56:20] jeroboam him that pith against the wall
[56:23] and him that is shut up and and left in
[56:25] Israel and I will take away the remnant
[56:28] of the House of jeroboam as a man take
[56:30] away dang till it be all
[56:39] gone that dieth of jeroboam in the city
[56:42] shall the dogs
[56:44] eat and him that dieth in the field
[56:47] shall the fouls of the air
[56:49] eat for the Lord has spoken
[56:52] it this
[56:55] is
[56:57] everything that comes to anybody that
[57:00] does not work in the
[57:03] world the promises of God are
[57:08] sure the ways of God are
[57:11] right and his reward is always on
[57:17] point but to those who walk according to
[57:19] his
[57:21] ways are you hearing
[57:23] me
[57:26] you see Saints even those of you who are
[57:28] on
[57:29] Zoom I want you to listen to this
[57:32] care you want to be
[57:35] blessed just like God had promised to
[57:39] bless but job
[57:44] sins could not help let him be
[57:48] blessed job went after other
[57:53] gods
[57:55] Mountain images he
[57:58] made and the Bible
[58:01] says he provoked God his
[58:06] anger because he cast God behind
[58:10] him let me tell you life and death are
[58:13] in your
[58:15] hands when God gives you his
[58:18] word his word is going to give you
[58:21] everything
[58:23] life yes but remember it is not only the
[58:28] promise of
[58:30] God it is also your way of Behaving
[58:34] around God's
[58:35] [Music]
[58:38] promise there is a part for us to
[58:42] play When God gives his
[58:45] promise his promise is sure it may tell
[58:49] that it will surely come to pass if you
[58:53] walk in his word
[58:55] is it easy no it is
[58:57] not a man who was promised a
[59:01] kingdom but he he he he he failed
[59:05] terribly you think because he didn't
[59:07] want
[59:08] to but in his
[59:12] understanding thank God for brother he
[59:14] preached a message Le not on your own
[59:21] understanding
[59:22] understanding was maybe telling him you
[59:24] have to marry these women so that you
[59:26] can keep the
[59:31] kingdom let me tell you we are not going
[59:34] to get the kingdom by
[59:37] alliances
[59:40] no you find even the
[59:43] churches they're doing what they
[59:45] call you know Federation of
[59:50] churches to come together so they can
[59:53] get money from the government
[59:56] and I heard someone saying even message
[59:57] Believers we should gather
[1:00:00] together so we can be powerful then we
[1:00:03] shall have a bishop over us the
[1:00:05] government shall give us money whenever
[1:00:07] they enthroning a bishop then they will
[1:00:10] give money and a
[1:00:15] car Believers of the message they also
[1:00:18] think that now but let me tell you we as
[1:00:22] a ENT message believers
[1:00:25] we don't need any
[1:00:28] alliances someone once asked me how do
[1:00:31] you how do you then you know look at how
[1:00:35] do you do order and how do you
[1:00:37] discipline those ones who are erant how
[1:00:40] do you do
[1:00:43] this
[1:00:46] without we have Aiven
[1:00:50] hierarchy that is according to the Bible
[1:00:53] a prophet said local Elder is the leader
[1:00:55] of the
[1:00:58] church is the highest Authority in the
[1:01:01] church local is the
[1:01:04] pastor is the highest
[1:01:07] order I was in Ethiopia we started the
[1:01:10] ministry there but I told the Believers
[1:01:14] I am just behind your pastor the highest
[1:01:17] Authority
[1:01:18] here but let me tell you also the church
[1:01:22] is not basing on the pastor
[1:01:26] the is just a
[1:01:29] servant who is also a
[1:01:32] prisoner to the word and the Holy
[1:01:36] Ghost so now as long as he gives the
[1:01:38] word and the Holy Ghost by the Holy
[1:01:41] Ghost then that is enough that's all we
[1:01:44] want to
[1:01:47] follow he thought he would make some
[1:01:49] alliances and because of that he
[1:01:53] followed after other gos
[1:01:55] and he put God behind his back he forgot
[1:01:58] who had put him in
[1:02:01] power he forgot who had lifted him
[1:02:05] up and because of that God cast the
[1:02:09] House of
[1:02:11] jerob God cast him God cast his children
[1:02:15] God cast his house God cast
[1:02:18] everything but if you walk in the ways
[1:02:21] of God God will bless you everything you
[1:02:29] have God help
[1:02:31] us that's why we are holding on to the
[1:02:35] world we are not ready to leave the
[1:02:38] world so help me
[1:02:40] God let us stand with the word no matter
[1:02:44] how the devil is pushing
[1:02:46] us we know we have a
[1:02:49] promise we have a promise a promise of
[1:02:53] victory
[1:02:56] hallelujah amen and the house of job was
[1:03:01] cast the sins of jerob caught up with
[1:03:05] him if you don't fight that
[1:03:08] demon if you don't overcome it none of
[1:03:11] these days it will catch up with
[1:03:15] you he had a very long
[1:03:18] Kingdom spoken to him by
[1:03:22] God but his dynasty did not continue
[1:03:25] because of worshiping other
[1:03:28] God God remembers
[1:03:30] everything and now after
[1:03:34] David
[1:03:37] after
[1:03:39] and comes
[1:03:42] King King came on the line because after
[1:03:46] after
[1:03:47] job it was always other kingdoms
[1:03:50] fighting and then another taking over
[1:03:51] another
[1:03:52] [Music]
[1:03:53] taking
[1:03:55] and later on IAB becomes a
[1:03:58] king and now the Bible says as I'm
[1:04:02] approaching to finish now I'll I'll
[1:04:05] continue with it
[1:04:06] later it came to pass as if it had been
[1:04:09] a light thing for him to walk in the
[1:04:11] sins of job
[1:04:16] son I have
[1:04:18] knew what God
[1:04:21] wanted but even King
[1:04:24] took it
[1:04:26] lightly he took it
[1:04:28] lightly to go after other
[1:04:32] gos he took it lightly to go to the club
[1:04:37] he took it lightly to go to all this B
[1:04:40] of
[1:04:43] games believer taking sin
[1:04:48] lightly took it lightly to go to
[1:04:51] fornication took it lightly to go to
[1:04:54] smoke took L to go to have a social
[1:04:58] drink those are the things that made the
[1:05:01] house of job to be
[1:05:05] cast those are the things that made God
[1:05:07] to divorce the
[1:05:10] denominations and he said I'm going to
[1:05:13] call a
[1:05:15] bride out of these
[1:05:17] denominations she will obey my voice she
[1:05:21] will believe my word she will follow
[1:05:24] after my
[1:05:25] ways are you the bride if you are the
[1:05:29] bride the Bible says they that
[1:05:32] call the name of the Lord must depart
[1:05:36] from
[1:05:37] Evil they must
[1:05:40] walk to the ways
[1:05:44] of oh
[1:05:46] Hallelujah I if it is a right thing to
[1:05:50] lie to tell a lie I beli tell a
[1:05:55] lie on
[1:05:59] you and the Bible says it had been a
[1:06:03] light thing for him to walk in the SS of
[1:06:07] job he took the wife of jeze the wife
[1:06:12] they took to wife
[1:06:15] Jezebel daughter
[1:06:17] of the king of the
[1:06:19] zians Jezebel became the
[1:06:23] power that control the
[1:06:26] king she trained the prophets of
[1:06:29] B to replace the true prophets of
[1:06:33] God she and her campaign were more
[1:06:40] vocal eating up the whole
[1:06:45] Kingdom this was the appropriate
[1:06:49] time for God to send
[1:06:51] Elijah for God to send Elijah
[1:06:55] God sends Elijah to come and bring back
[1:06:59] chaos to
[1:07:02] order
[1:07:03] Hallelujah the ministry of
[1:07:06] Elijah comes to bring chaos back to
[1:07:13] order praise
[1:07:15] God and again we see it coming here when
[1:07:21] Israel is in
[1:07:22] chaos is on the
[1:07:25] rise Jezebel controlling the nation
[1:07:29] of King had taken the way of
[1:07:34] Jobo so because of that Elijah comes on
[1:07:37] the seene and when Elijah comes he
[1:07:41] doesn't come to play he doesn't come to
[1:07:43] begin an
[1:07:44] organization he doesn't come to make to
[1:07:47] get the members to follow him he doesn't
[1:07:50] even come to start a church comes for
