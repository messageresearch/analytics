[1:14:39] ethiopian jews
[1:14:54] the specific group groups of them are
[1:14:57] kevin jackson
[1:14:59] that live in the northern parts of the
[1:15:01] country
[1:15:03] that pe and people dislike them
[1:15:07] and one of them
[1:15:08] brother was telling me that they the the
[1:15:10] people think about all kind of things
[1:15:14] these people are accused
[1:15:17] you know because they will just look at
[1:15:19] you

[1:15:54] and see how they can be able to live and
[1:15:56] cohabit these people
[1:16:04] but you see
[1:16:05] what the people this man told me
[1:16:10] it is in his words i'm commenting
[1:16:14] he said no wonder in our country we've
[1:16:16] been cast
[1:16:19] because how can they treat the jews that
[1:16:21] way by yourself

[2:32:06] uh
[2:32:10] we went and walked on the road dragon
[2:32:12] and timeline
[2:32:15] we found a young man on the road on the
[2:32:17] streets
[2:32:20] and he was going his way
[2:32:26] he was going his way
[2:32:28] myself and brother paul is an organ that
[2:32:31] paul had found our life's purpose while
[2:32:33] it was
[2:32:37] and that was to leave for the lord
[2:32:41] to preach this message
[2:32:43] this young man
[2:32:48] having his own plans
[2:33:04] talk
[2:33:18] he did
[2:33:26] [Music]
[2:33:32] meaning
[2:34:00] when i went back to ethiopia when i was
[2:34:02] ethiopia that was the second trip the
[2:34:04] third trip around your book saturday in
[2:34:06] 2014.
[2:34:08] coming in i felt in my heart
[2:34:11] why not follow up with that man i'm
[2:34:13] obsessed
[2:35:28] that maybe god will lead us and use us
[2:35:31] to convert one pastor in the
[2:35:33] pentecostals into the knowledge of the
[2:35:34] truth and then they can preach this
[2:35:36] message
[2:35:38] i'm assuming
[2:35:52] god starts builds something from nothing
[2:35:55] catholics image into occupation but all
[2:35:58] the time most of the time people love
[2:36:00] and people enjoy things which are
[2:36:02] already built
[2:36:04] into obviously
[2:36:06] listen don't be distracted no would you
[2:36:07] never know concluding here
[2:36:09] people love things which are big and i'm
[2:36:11] trying to be people like things which
[2:36:13] are beautiful
[2:36:15] i don't know it's beginning
[2:36:18] and no one is interested in going in the
[2:36:20] beginning
[2:36:22] of it
[2:36:24] praise the lord come here
[2:36:26] listen church i'm giving you my burden
[2:36:28] this morning
[2:36:30] hallelujah
[2:36:34] and this brother hologram don't know we
[2:36:38] continued with him
[2:36:40] together we would come together
[2:36:43] in our room
[2:36:46] myself and two or three people
[2:37:15] and i saw him looking at that
[2:37:31] and so
[2:37:32] it was like a dagger in my heart
[2:37:37] again i went to christ
[2:37:42] [Music]
[2:37:45] and when we finish prayer retirement
[2:37:47] we usually say if you have any questions
[2:37:52] and then from that we can begin sharing
[2:37:53] the work
[2:37:56] and then this brother organ
[2:37:59] the question
[2:38:01] and i will never forget
[2:38:06] he asked the question and say
[2:38:08] how do they pray
[2:38:17] honestly speaking
[2:38:19] i did not know how to answer that
[2:38:20] question
[2:38:23] for you how to pray
[2:38:25] i had learned how to pray nothing
[2:38:40] i'm emotional because
[2:38:42] i'm looking there and now
[2:38:47] [Music]
[2:38:51] then i told him
[2:38:54] i
[2:38:54] i i was fidgeting with my words because
[2:38:56] i did not know how to answer
[2:39:01] but i thought about jesus
[2:39:03] because they said when they asked you
[2:39:07] don't worry what you would say
[2:40:17] you know you know an apartment you know
[2:40:18] apartments apartments
[2:40:20] so um there are people living under us
[2:40:24] that brother slowly by slowly organizing
[2:40:27] the anointing of prayer
