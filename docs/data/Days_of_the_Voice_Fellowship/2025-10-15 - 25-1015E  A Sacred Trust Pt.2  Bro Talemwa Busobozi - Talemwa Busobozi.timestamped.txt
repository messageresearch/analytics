[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; We are reading in the book of Luke
[38:30] chapter 16.
[38:46] verses one
[38:48] tonight. We read this on Sunday
[38:54] &gt;&gt; and so I do not expect to take along.
[38:57] Nice to see you, brother. God bless you.
[39:02] But for the sake of those who are not
[39:03] with us on Sunday, let's just read it
[39:04] again.
[39:11] And he said also unto his disciples, we
[39:13] just take it verse by verse. Unto his
[39:16] disciples, there was a certain rich man
[39:19] which had a steward, and the same was
[39:21] accused unto him that he had wasted his
[39:24] goods.
[39:27] [Music]
[39:40] And he called him and said unto him,
[39:43] "How is it that I hear this of thee?
[39:47] Give an account of thy stewardship, for
[39:49] thou mayest be no longer a steward.
[40:03] Then the steward said with within
[40:06] himself, "What shall I do? For my lord
[40:09] taketh away from me the stewardship I
[40:12] cannot dig to beg. I am ashamed.
[40:18] [Music]
[40:29] I am resolved what to do that when I am
[40:33] put out of the stewardship they may
[40:35] receive me into their houses.
[40:44] Now, now remember that the ones that he
[40:46] wants the the ones that he is desiring
[40:49] that will receive him are the people
[40:53] that were being he was being he was
[40:55] serving
[41:02] the dattors of his master.
[41:08] So he called everyone, this is verse
[41:10] five, of his glorious datas unto him,
[41:13] and said unto the first, "How much ost
[41:16] thou unto my lord?" And he said, "An 100
[41:18] measures of oil." And he said unto him,
[41:20] "Take thy bill and sit down quickly and
[41:22] write 50.
[41:38] Then said he to another, "And how much
[41:41] to another, and how much, oh thou?" And
[41:45] he said, "Anunded measures of wheat."
[41:47] And he said unto him, "Take thy bill and
[41:50] write for for score.
[41:54] [Music]
[42:03] And and the Lord commended the unjust
[42:05] steward because he had done wisely. For
[42:08] the children of this world are in their
[42:10] generation wiser than the children of
[42:12] light.
[42:18] [Music]
[42:31] And I say unto you, make to yourselves
[42:32] friends of the m of unrighteousness,
[42:34] that when ye fail, they may receive you
[42:37] into everlasting habitation.
[42:50] Now tonight I want us to take maybe
[42:53] three more verses.
[42:56] He that is faithful in that which is
[42:58] least is faithful also in much. And he
[43:01] that is unjust in the least is unjust
[43:03] also in much.
[43:14] Can we say amen to that?
[43:17] If therefore ye cannot be cannot if ye
[43:21] therefore um excuse me if therefore ye
[43:24] have not been faithful in the
[43:26] unrighteous mammon who will commit to
[43:30] you trust the true riches.
[43:41] Praise God.
[43:43] And if ye have not been faithful in that
[43:47] which is another man is, who shall give
[43:51] you that which is your own?
[44:03] 13.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; No servant can serve two monsters, for
[44:07] either he will hate the one and love the
[44:10] other, or else he will hold to the one
[44:12] and despise the other. Ye cannot serve
[44:15] God and mmon.
[44:31] Amen. You may be seated.
[44:33] This is a a very good um a a very good
[44:37] exhortation from the Lord.
[44:41] [Music]
[44:43] And um I'd like you where you are seated
[44:46] to really be attentive and listen
[44:50] and you know whenever you are hearing
[44:52] the word you should always try to
[44:53] personalize it to yourself.
[44:58] Own it.
[45:00] So don't say they preaching to somebody
[45:03] else
[45:05] or to someone who did not come
[45:09] or to someone who is streaming.
[45:13] The Lord is speaking to me.
[45:17] How many came to hear from the Lord?
[45:20] Amen. And so I I also came to hear from
[45:22] the Lord.
[45:24] I believe that he would speak to each of
[45:26] us.
[45:28] Praise God. It's always wonderful to see
[45:30] those who make it on Wednesday.
[45:34] And sometimes there's more, sometimes
[45:36] there's less.
[45:39] But it's always a honor if you can be
[45:41] able to squeeze in time and be in
[45:43] church.
[45:48] Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; At the end of the day,
[45:52] you realize that you have been a good
[45:54] steward
[45:56] because you see you've been given time.
[46:00] How are you using your time?
[46:03] Are you using it to serve the Lord?
[46:06] You cannot serve two masters.
[46:09] They used to read this scripture back in
[46:11] the in the days in the Anglican church.
[46:16] But what the reason why I appreciate the
[46:17] message of the hour
[46:20] is it goes way deeper into these things,
[46:23] these scriptures
[46:26] and opens a lot more for us.
[46:30] And so you cannot serve God and M.
[46:34] You are here in this dimension to serve
[46:36] the Lord.
[46:39] You are here to live for the Lord.
[46:42] Whatever you have
[46:44] Whatever you you he allows you to
[46:47] possess in your hand
[46:50] is not for you to own.
[46:55] It is for his glory.
[46:59] And um remember our title is a sacred
[47:02] trust
[47:06] and we found that the meaning of a word
[47:09] of the word sacred trust
[47:12] or a trust rather
[47:15] is a trust is a legal arrangement where
[47:18] a person or entity that who is the
[47:20] trustee holds assets for the benefit of
[47:22] another person.
[47:32] Uh, you know, I I remember when we were
[47:34] still young,
[47:36] you know, you would take your bread
[47:39] and maybe you give it to your elder
[47:40] brother
[47:42] and you tell them, "Keep for me."
[47:45] But you know sometimes you you come back
[47:47] and you find that they have eaten a
[47:49] piece of it
[47:52] and then you you will begin crying out
[47:54] loud and you will say now I don't want
[47:57] it.
[47:59] Now I don't even want it again. I I want
[48:02] you to to buy me a new one. Why? Because
[48:06] they were not a good trustee.
[48:09] And that's how many Christians are
[48:12] that God has given to us something.
[48:16] And we found, we went through a lot of
[48:18] them on Sunday
[48:20] and found that each of us has something
[48:22] that God has entrusted us with.
[48:27] We are trustees.
[48:29] We are holding certain assets.
[48:33] in each of us.
[48:36] There are certain assets.
[48:40] Sometimes there are natural gifts
[48:45] embedded in you
[48:47] [Music]
[48:48] that you can do certain things
[48:52] different from anybody else.
[48:55] It means you are people call it in the
[48:57] world talented.
[49:02] You find that someone maybe is talented
[49:04] to uh to do works of art.
[49:09] Maybe someone is talented to sing
[49:14] or maybe another is talented to you know
[49:17] do something that in in a in a very
[49:20] extraordinary way
[49:22] [Music]
[49:25] and and so those are abilities given to
[49:27] us by God.
[49:31] All of us we have it. You have yours. I
[49:33] have mine.
[49:35] Each of us is born special.
[49:40] Praise God.
[49:43] But you know, we were not given those
[49:45] things so that we might be able to own
[49:47] them.
[49:51] Sometimes it may not be a talent or a
[49:53] gift.
[49:56] Sometimes it might be certain
[49:57] breakthroughs in life.
[50:01] Maybe a good job.
[50:04] Maybe a good car, maybe a bicycle or
[50:08] maybe a motorcycle or maybe a house
[50:12] or maybe you know um a good business
[50:17] and you have um a very good income
[50:21] and you know those things are not really
[50:23] yours.
[50:25] If you thought it was yours, you were
[50:27] mistaken.
[50:30] It was given to you
[50:32] as a sacred trust from God.
[50:38] You know, a sac trust is not just
[50:39] something given to you to own.
[50:44] It is something uh entrusted for to you
[50:48] for divine purpose.
[50:55] divine purpose.
[50:58] You know now I know we read that
[51:00] scripture many times
[51:03] which says for all things
[51:07] work together for good
[51:11] to them that love the Lord.
[51:16] And he doesn't stop there. He says to
[51:18] them that are called according to his
[51:22] purpose.
[51:26] So there is a purpose
[51:28] of God in each of our life.
[51:34] And if you've not found your purpose in
[51:36] life,
[51:39] you have not started living.
[51:44] Until you find your life's purpose,
[51:49] then you have started to live
[51:53] because you will be remembered for the
[51:56] purpose God placed you here for
[52:02] you know you can do a lot of things but
[52:06] when they are completely out of your
[52:07] purpose
[52:09] or rather should I say God's purpose for
[52:11] your life.
[52:14] That's why it is always important for us
[52:16] as believers to know the perfect will of
[52:18] God for our life in important matters.
[52:26] In every important matter.
[52:29] And how do you know? Through prayer.
[52:33] Through communication.
[52:36] You have to talk to the Lord. But how
[52:38] many of us pray? How many of us spend
[52:41] some time with the Lord in prayer?
[52:44] You find that the less you pray, the
[52:47] more problems you're going to have in
[52:48] your life
[52:51] because you'll be confused.
[52:53] You know the word, but you're living out
[52:56] of purpose.
[52:57] But when you when you live a life of
[53:00] prayer,
[53:02] you know, each time you consult with
[53:04] God,
[53:05] you know, you are is helping you to live
[53:07] according to your life's purpose.
[53:13] I don't know about you, but I desire I
[53:15] have this desire that I I be found each
[53:19] time in God's purpose for my life.
[53:24] You know, when you know you are doing
[53:25] God's purpose for your life,
[53:29] you don't fear anything. Hallelujah.
[53:33] Whatever you do, you don't fear no man.
[53:36] You don't fear what they will say.
[53:39] You know many times people fear what
[53:41] will they say?
[53:44] If I know I am walking in God's purpose
[53:46] for me,
[53:49] I don't fear what they will say
[53:52] because I am not here to do according to
[53:54] what they will say.
[53:57] But I'm here to live according to what
[53:59] he will think about me.
[54:03] After I'm done with this life, I want to
[54:06] walk into the other dimension.
[54:08] And I want to hear him say, "Well done,
[54:12] thou good and faithful servant."
[54:15] I want to be a good steward.
[54:18] But how can you be a good steward? If
[54:21] you don't even know what has been
[54:23] entrusted you with,
[54:28] you don't know what you have.
[54:31] And that's why Jesus said the children
[54:34] of this world
[54:36] in their generation they are wiser than
[54:39] the children of light.
[54:43] They know
[54:45] what they are entrusted with.
[54:48] They know how to utilize it and how to
[54:52] use it so that it will prepare for their
[54:55] future.
[54:57] Brethren, let us wake up. Let us begin
[55:01] planning and preparing for our future.
[55:06] And the future I'm talking about is not
[55:08] of this world
[55:11] because our Lord said, "My kingdom is
[55:13] not of this world."
[55:16] Amen. And you know all the old saints,
[55:20] we are looking for for for that kingdom,
[55:24] for that city whose builder and maker is
[55:27] God.
[55:30] And it is not of this world
[55:32] is in another dimension.
[55:34] Rather, I believe we are being prepared
[55:38] to walk into another dimension.
[55:41] That is the purpose of the word.
[55:45] The purpose of the word is to prepare
[55:46] you
[55:48] to make you ready.
[55:50] And here this man,
[55:53] praise God,
[55:56] he was a bad steward,
[56:00] he was a bad steward because
[56:04] &gt;&gt; or we can call him the an unjust steward
[56:09] because the master gave him, you know,
[56:12] this job.
[56:15] But according to uh the reporters that
[56:17] he had wasted his the master's goods.
[56:22] [Music]
[56:23] And when he learned
[56:26] that he was going to be uh fired,
[56:30] he quickly now began to think about his
[56:34] future.
[56:35] [Music]
[56:39] He started thinking about his future.
[56:40] How shall I live?
[56:43] He said, I cannot dig.
[56:46] I don't know how to dig. I I I I am I'm
[56:49] ashamed to beg.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Where will I have a living?
[56:54] So now he said I am resolved what I'm
[56:56] going to do.
[56:59] He quickly began calling one by one. And
[57:02] you know the first one he called. He was
[57:05] owing um something like uh 100 measures
[57:09] of oil
[57:12] and he said okay as for you quickly get
[57:16] a pen write 50 that's what you will pay.
[57:21] So he forgave him 50 and the second one
[57:25] it was 100 he told him now write 80
[57:28] quickly quickly. So he forgave him 20
[57:32] and he went on and on and on and I want
[57:35] you to imagine if how many were the
[57:37] debtors were there.
[57:40] We don't want to have an idea
[57:43] but he must have forgave them a lot of
[57:44] money
[57:46] and he was planning his life after being
[57:49] fired
[57:53] said because he knew that if I forgive
[57:55] these people some money
[57:58] I have made them my friends
[58:02] when I am fired from them they will
[58:05] receive me in their home
[58:09] because I I I they know how much I
[58:11] forgave them when I was still in the
[58:15] position of authority
[58:17] when I could tell them write this man
[58:19] write this man and you know the way he
[58:21] was doing it do it quickly quickly
[58:22] quickly quickly before he's fired
[58:26] because he knew what was coming but he
[58:28] wanted to secure his future
[58:32] and he did it so well
[58:34] so cunningly
[58:36] and Jesus commanded him
[58:40] Amen. He commanded that unjust steward.
[58:44] He say he said he had done wisely.
[58:48] And what's the wisdom
[58:51] that he used? He was able to use the
[58:53] resources
[58:56] that he had been entrusted with
[59:00] though unjustly.
[59:04] But he he he used it wisely.
[59:15] to secure his future.
[59:18] Brother, that is a wise man.
[59:22] I'm sure after he was fired,
[59:25] he did not beg
[59:27] and also he did not dig.
[59:31] But he was being helped by these people.
[59:35] He would go from one to one.
[59:37] You remember how much you were owed but
[59:40] you remember you remember what I did for
[59:41] you. You know you was like the
[59:44] politicians these days.
[59:46] Praise God. And now Jesus is telling us
[59:51] we should also make ourselves friends of
[59:53] the m of unrighteousness
[59:57] that when we fail
[1:00:00] they will they shall receive that we may
[1:00:02] they may receive us in into everlasting
[1:00:04] habitation.
[1:00:08] Now friends and that we can talk about
[1:00:11] it in many different directions
[1:00:14] but I wanted to talk about that and say
[1:00:18] it's not only money
[1:00:20] it's the resources that we are given
[1:00:22] while we are on earth
[1:00:26] we should use them wisely.
[1:00:30] Whatever you have, if you use it wisely,
[1:00:34] it will help you to receive eternal
[1:00:35] life.
[1:00:38] Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; We find people in the Bible who just,
[1:00:43] you know, helped others to have some
[1:00:45] clothing.
[1:00:48] We find others who just visited, you
[1:00:50] know, those who were in in prison.
[1:00:54] Maybe they gave a cup of water or or
[1:00:56] drink or food or something
[1:00:58] and they were able to get eternal life
[1:01:00] like that
[1:01:02] just like that. They used what the
[1:01:04] substance that they have
[1:01:07] and when they failed
[1:01:10] they were received
[1:01:12] into eternal life. Now friends, we also
[1:01:16] have resources.
[1:01:18] We have assets that God has entrusted us
[1:01:22] with.
[1:01:24] Amen. And if we use it wisely,
[1:01:27] if we are faithful with there,
[1:01:31] we will never fail.
[1:01:34] The Bible says that he that is faithful
[1:01:36] in little
[1:01:39] is also faithful in much.
[1:01:43] But he that is unjust in the least
[1:01:47] is unjust also in much.
[1:01:50] What makes you think that God will
[1:01:52] increase your level? He will bless you
[1:01:54] if you are not faithful in the little
[1:01:56] that you have.
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:02] What you have today? I have a question
[1:02:05] for you.
[1:02:08] This is real.
[1:02:10] How are you serving God?
[1:02:15] Please don't only put money in your
[1:02:17] mind.
[1:02:21] put money and much more.
[1:02:24] How are you serving the Lord
[1:02:28] with your time?
[1:02:32] With your money,
[1:02:34] with your mouth,
[1:02:36] with your body, with your ears, with
[1:02:40] your eyes, with your children, with your
[1:02:43] wife and husband and family and friends
[1:02:47] that you have.
[1:02:49] the the church family and whatever God
[1:02:51] has allowed you to have
[1:02:55] that you have in your hand, how have you
[1:02:58] utilized it?
[1:03:00] Have you been faithful in that?
[1:03:03] Because if you're faithful in that, I
[1:03:06] can almost tell you prepare for
[1:03:08] promotion.
[1:03:10] Do not look for promotion
[1:03:13] if you're not faithful in what you have.
[1:03:17] But if you're faithful in what you have,
[1:03:20] it is a must for you to be promoted.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our Lord is a faithful master.
[1:03:27] He can never make you serve him for
[1:03:29] nothing.
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:31] He can never fail you or forsake you.
[1:03:35] That's why if you are faithful in the
[1:03:37] little that you have,
[1:03:40] he will promote you. He will promote
[1:03:43] you. You know what did he tell the
[1:03:45] disciples?
[1:03:46] They came to him and he said, "What
[1:03:48] about us who are forsaken mothers,
[1:03:51] fathers and houses and the things and
[1:03:53] what whatever more?
[1:03:57] What shall we get?" You know, he said
[1:03:59] you'll get 100fold here and over there.
[1:04:04] He even said they'll get houses and
[1:04:06] lands.
[1:04:08] So whatever whatever you do to serve the
[1:04:11] Lord,
[1:04:13] there is a promotion.
[1:04:16] That's one thing I love about the Lord.
[1:04:19] Amen. He always promotes you
[1:04:24] on on the basis of merit.
[1:04:29] You can never bribe him.
[1:04:32] Some people want to bribe God with their
[1:04:33] prayers.
[1:04:36] Yet you are not faithful,
[1:04:38] but you are trying to bribe him with
[1:04:40] prayers.
[1:04:42] Let me tell you, pray after doing the
[1:04:43] right thing.
[1:04:47] There are principles of of the word
[1:04:51] in every matter
[1:04:54] in marriage,
[1:04:56] in family,
[1:04:58] in in finances,
[1:05:00] in you know jobs and work and
[1:05:02] everything. There are principles.
[1:05:05] Seek to know those principles.
[1:05:08] Be faithful at them.
[1:05:12] Amen. And then pray.
[1:05:16] But if you are not faithful
[1:05:18] and you're very busy praying,
[1:05:21] expect no promotion.
[1:05:25] You find in the book of Acts.
[1:05:29] There was a man called Cornelius.
[1:05:32] Praise God. Cornelius was a good man.
[1:05:36] The Bible says he he loved to do alms.
[1:05:41] He always wanted to help others.
[1:05:44] He had a heart of helping others.
[1:05:47] And are you following me? Are you
[1:05:50] following me? He always loved to help
[1:05:52] others.
[1:05:54] And so and also he was a soldier.
[1:05:58] But also the Bible says he he he loved
[1:06:02] prayer.
[1:06:03] So they so he did not only pray,
[1:06:07] he always helped
[1:06:09] and he gathered people and his house and
[1:06:11] everybody
[1:06:13] did whatever he could do. And he had a
[1:06:16] desire for the truth,
[1:06:19] but he did not know how to get,
[1:06:22] but he only did what he could do.
[1:06:26] You don't know how you will get what you
[1:06:28] want,
[1:06:31] but what you want, the ability to get it
[1:06:34] is already deposed in you.
[1:06:40] Just be faithful.
[1:06:42] Be faithful with the principles of the
[1:06:44] word
[1:06:46] and then God will also be faithful.
[1:06:49] Amen. To to be able to promote you.
[1:06:52] And then this man, you know, as as he
[1:06:55] was praying, he he did not know any
[1:06:58] person who was Christian.
[1:07:01] But somehow God who was rich in mercy,
[1:07:04] he sent an angel. He sent an angel. God
[1:07:09] will always send angels.
[1:07:12] Amen. We know we have we have angels
[1:07:15] with wings
[1:07:17] and angels without wings.
[1:07:20] And this evening, right now, You are
[1:07:22] listening to an angel without wings.
[1:07:26] God has sent you an angel tonight.
[1:07:29] If you have ears to hear,
[1:07:33] what he says, let him that has ears to
[1:07:35] hear, let him hear what the spirit say
[1:07:36] unto the church.
[1:07:40] Amen. And he sent an angel and he told
[1:07:42] him, "Amen, go and call Peter
[1:07:45] somewhere." I think it was some other
[1:07:46] place.
[1:07:49] and and um this man sent an um a company
[1:07:52] you know people to go and pick up Peter.
[1:07:56] We know that the Lord had also spoken to
[1:07:57] Peter.
[1:08:00] You know you know the vision that he got
[1:08:01] of the sheet and
[1:08:04] with all the animals and he told him
[1:08:05] kill and eat. He said no Lord I can
[1:08:09] listen listen follow me I cannot eat
[1:08:11] that which is unclean.
[1:08:15] You know what? This man Cornelius
[1:08:19] was a Roman, meaning he was a gentile.
[1:08:23] But you see, people like Peter
[1:08:26] did not believe in preaching the gospel
[1:08:27] to the Gentiles.
[1:08:31] They only thought that the gospel was
[1:08:33] for the Jews
[1:08:35] because, you know, he was a Jew.
[1:08:38] And so he refused. Of course, the gospel
[1:08:40] was not for the Gentiles. It was for the
[1:08:42] Jews.
[1:08:45] But also, you know, according to the
[1:08:47] Jewish rules,
[1:08:50] the laws, there were animals they were
[1:08:53] not supposed to eat.
[1:08:56] Of course, even the Old Testament. And
[1:08:58] the Jews believed in the Old Testament.
[1:09:02] And so they were not supposed to eat the
[1:09:04] unclean animals.
[1:09:06] And they were supposed to eat the ones
[1:09:08] which were clean.
[1:09:10] But in that also
[1:09:13] it also meant that the the Gentiles were
[1:09:15] unclean before God
[1:09:20] and they had not been accepted by God.
[1:09:23] Because remember when he came, he came
[1:09:25] into the house of Israel.
[1:09:30] Are you following me? But by grace.
[1:09:34] Amen. According to Romans chapter 11,
[1:09:37] the Gentiles were grafted in
[1:09:42] You know, we were the wild. The Bible
[1:09:44] says we were the wild branch.
[1:09:47] But you see, by grace,
[1:09:49] he cut us from the wild
[1:09:53] and he grafted us onto the olive tree.
[1:09:57] So now we are receiving the life of the
[1:10:00] olive tree.
[1:10:02] The olive tree which is Christ.
[1:10:05] We are now receiving the life of it.
[1:10:08] And the Jews were cut off
[1:10:11] because of unbelief.
[1:10:14] So right now it is the dispensation of
[1:10:16] the Gentiles
[1:10:21] and the Gentiles cannot be cut off
[1:10:24] until the fullness comes
[1:10:28] and the fullness of the Gentiles
[1:10:31] listen is coming in at the end of the
[1:10:34] seven church ages.
[1:10:37] Revelation 1, 2, and 3 speaks of the
[1:10:40] seven church ages
[1:10:43] from from the first one, Ephesian.
[1:10:46] [Applause]
[1:10:48] And you know, in every age,
[1:10:52] there is a bride.
[1:10:54] There is a message
[1:10:56] with a message to call out the bride. In
[1:11:00] Ephesus, there was a message with a
[1:11:03] message. His name was Paul. and he was
[1:11:06] the very first one. All the other
[1:11:09] messengers
[1:11:11] must have the same message like the
[1:11:13] first one
[1:11:16] and you know all through the seven
[1:11:18] churches.
[1:11:20] You know God kept on sending his word
[1:11:22] and sending his word and sending his
[1:11:24] word and why there were people there to
[1:11:27] receive that word.
[1:11:30] Are you following me? And we have
[1:11:33] arrived
[1:11:34] at the very last age.
[1:11:38] This is the last age by the way.
[1:11:42] Can you imagine that brother? This is
[1:11:44] the last generation.
[1:11:46] There is no more time. There is no more
[1:11:49] ages. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[1:11:53] after seven
[1:11:56] eight. Number seven in the counting of
[1:12:00] God is a number of completion.
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Number eight is a number of eternity.
[1:12:15] Praise God. Even in mathematics they
[1:12:18] write it like that.
[1:12:20] Eight.
[1:12:22] What's that? Is it called better?
[1:12:27] Infinity.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I think that's right. I'm not
[1:12:30] really sure, but I think that's it.
[1:12:33] Yeah, but it's the number of eternity.
[1:12:36] Eight.
[1:12:38] Go and find out. So now when you count
[1:12:40] from 1 to seven
[1:12:43] is completion.
[1:12:47] And then when you go when you continue,
[1:12:50] you now enter into eternity.
[1:12:54] A new beginning. You continue a new
[1:12:57] beginning. A new beginning. Now listen.
[1:13:01] After the seventh church age,
[1:13:05] the then comes the rapture.
[1:13:09] When we walk into that dimension,
[1:13:12] there is no growing old anymore.
[1:13:15] We will be younger forever.
[1:13:18] We will no more get sick.
[1:13:20] We will have overcome the world
[1:13:22] completely.
[1:13:26] But only the good stewards
[1:13:29] will enter in there.
[1:13:32] Praise God. And so this man, Apostle
[1:13:36] Rather Peter, when he heard the voice,
[1:13:40] the voice spoke to him and said, "Kill
[1:13:42] and eat." He said, "I can't eat that
[1:13:45] which is unholy."
[1:13:48] That is true.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; It was unholy. But something happened.
[1:13:53] Amen.
[1:13:55] The blood was shed.
[1:13:58] The savior died. You remember revelation
[1:14:01] 5?
[1:14:03] Amen. When the voice said, "Who is
[1:14:04] worthy?"
[1:14:06] And there was no one worthy. And John
[1:14:09] wept. But then he had a voice weep not
[1:14:13] John.
[1:14:14] The lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:14:17] has prevailed. Protect the boot. and to
[1:14:20] lose the seven thereof.
[1:14:24] Amen. And who is that one? He turned to
[1:14:27] see. And when he turned to see, he saw a
[1:14:30] lamb
[1:14:32] which was slain before the foundation of
[1:14:34] the world.
[1:14:36] A lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:14:37] the world.
[1:14:39] Yes, the Gentiles were unclean.
[1:14:43] But in the mind of God, there was never
[1:14:46] a time when they were unclean.
[1:14:50] All those that had the DNA of God,
[1:14:55] the identity of God in them,
[1:14:58] they have never been unclean.
[1:15:01] They have never been sinners.
[1:15:04] They have never been an forsaken.
[1:15:07] Do you know that's what you wear in the
[1:15:09] mind of God?
[1:15:12] Do you know you have actually never been
[1:15:14] a sinner?
[1:15:16] Do you know you have always been
[1:15:17] perfect?
[1:15:20] in the mind of God.
[1:15:22] And why are you here? You are here to be
[1:15:25] manifested.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; To be manifested.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. As a child of God, a son of God.
[1:15:35] But you see, what does he do to prove
[1:15:38] who you are? He gives you a trust.
[1:15:43] Amen. He gives you a trust and he says,
[1:15:46] "Keep it.
[1:15:48] Use it well. Prove the devil
[1:15:53] who you are. Prove the devil. You are a
[1:15:56] good trust.
[1:15:59] Hallelujah. Amen. There are others who
[1:16:01] are unjust.
[1:16:04] But we are just stewards
[1:16:06] because what we have been entrusted with
[1:16:10] he cannot trust us.
[1:16:12] If he did not know us,
[1:16:16] he knew us before the foundation of the
[1:16:18] world and he cannot give us this
[1:16:20] sacriice,
[1:16:23] not knowing we shall overcome
[1:16:26] or knowing that we fail.
[1:16:29] Listen, he cannot save you to lose you.
[1:16:34] He saved you knowing he can never.
[1:16:39] Even when you fail him, he can never
[1:16:42] fail you.
[1:16:44] Why? Because you have always been a gene
[1:16:47] of God.
[1:16:51] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; What is this sac trust?
[1:16:56] He has given us the sac trust of his
[1:16:58] word.
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; You know in the beginning he gave it to
[1:17:06] Adam. Adam this sacred trust
[1:17:10] and he told him this is the word keep it
[1:17:13] the day you eat there you shall die the
[1:17:16] day the day you disobey me you will die
[1:17:19] the day you a bad steward you will die
[1:17:22] take this word keep it
[1:17:25] do what I said
[1:17:27] never eat of the tree of knowledge of
[1:17:29] good and evil but Adam
[1:17:32] you know he lost it
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; you know he lost that title did. But I'm
[1:17:39] so glad
[1:17:41] the title did. Amen. Has been taken
[1:17:45] because there has been one that is worth
[1:17:46] it to take it to lose it and open the
[1:17:53] mystery.
[1:17:55] Hallelujah. Do you know the mystery has
[1:17:57] opened?
[1:18:01] Do you know the mystery of the book?
[1:18:05] I'm asking you a question. Do you know
[1:18:08] the mystery of that book?
[1:18:13] The mystery of that book.
[1:18:15] I have always pointed you to Colossians
[1:18:18] 1.
[1:18:21] is that even the mystery
[1:18:24] which was hid from generation
[1:18:27] but now it has been revealed has been
[1:18:31] made manifest
[1:18:34] which is what
[1:18:36] is Christ in you
[1:18:40] Christ in you
[1:18:42] hope of glory
[1:18:45] without Christ being in you
[1:18:48] there is no hope of glory
[1:18:51] The Bible says all have sinned and have
[1:18:55] come short of the glory.
[1:18:59] Through Adam, we all died.
[1:19:02] Through Adam, we all sinned. Through
[1:19:04] Adam, we all fell.
[1:19:07] Through Adam, we all lost the glory.
[1:19:10] But thank God for a second.
[1:19:14] Thank God for the oil.
[1:19:17] Hallelujah. Amen. Listen, all the church
[1:19:20] agents,
[1:19:23] all the church agents, they have been
[1:19:26] taking a portion of that book.
[1:19:30] Passion, portion, portion, portion,
[1:19:31] portion. But listen, the full mystery
[1:19:38] of that book would not be revealed.
[1:19:43] It it would not be revealed
[1:19:47] until the last day
[1:19:52] until the end time.
[1:19:55] Hallelujah. Are you following me?
[1:19:59] Until the last day bride is
[1:20:03] until the seventh age has come.
[1:20:08] Revelation 10:7.
[1:20:11] That's why we are called days of the
[1:20:12] voice
[1:20:14] of the voice because it says in the day
[1:20:17] of the voice of the seven.
[1:20:21] Hallelujah. You know, Revelation 10:1,
[1:20:25] you know, the mighty angel descends down
[1:20:28] with an open book.
[1:20:31] Amen. And uh the Bible says as he began
[1:20:34] to sound, as he began to speak,
[1:20:38] seven thunders uttered their voice.
[1:20:41] And when seven thunders uttered their
[1:20:43] voice,
[1:20:45] John was about to write.
[1:20:47] But the voice told him, "No, no, no,
[1:20:50] John, do not write down.
[1:20:54] Leave this stuff.
[1:20:56] Leave it sealed."
[1:20:59] You remember even Daniel
[1:21:01] It was the same thing
[1:21:05] said it's not for it's not the time
[1:21:08] no mighty prophet
[1:21:11] no all with all those great prophets
[1:21:15] were able to know the mystery
[1:21:20] but that mystery would be revealed in
[1:21:24] the last days
[1:21:28] but in the days of the voice
[1:21:31] of the seventh angel.
[1:21:33] Not the first angel, not the second
[1:21:36] angel, not the third angel, not the
[1:21:38] fourth angel. Where's my picture, my
[1:21:40] brother? Not the fifth angel. Not the
[1:21:43] sixth angel. But he said in the day of
[1:21:46] the what? Of the what? Come on now. Of
[1:21:50] the what? Of the voice.
[1:21:54] He did not say the days of the seventh
[1:21:56] angel.
[1:22:01] He did not say in the days of the
[1:22:04] seventh angel.
[1:22:07] No, he said in the days of the voice
[1:22:12] of the seventh angel
[1:22:14] when he begins to serve.
[1:22:17] Hallelujah. The mystery of God should be
[1:22:20] finished.
[1:22:22] Hallelujah. When brother Bam was
[1:22:24] baptizing
[1:22:26] in Ohio River 1933,
[1:22:29] the voice spoke out of fire came and a
[1:22:32] voice came out
[1:22:34] and spoke these words as John the
[1:22:38] Baptist
[1:22:39] was sent to for my first coming.
[1:22:45] Your message
[1:22:47] will for
[1:22:50] my second coming.
[1:22:52] your what
[1:22:54] message.
[1:22:56] Hallelujah.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Not you.
[1:23:00] Your message.
[1:23:02] And God gave him an instruction.
[1:23:04] Record all these messages you're
[1:23:06] preaching.
[1:23:10] It will be food for my bride
[1:23:13] in the end time.
[1:23:16] What is it? is a voice of the seventh
[1:23:20] angel in the days of the voice of the
[1:23:23] seventh angel. when he begins to sound
[1:23:26] that's why we listen to those text
[1:23:30] that's why we read those books
[1:23:32] let me tell you if you are not you have
[1:23:34] to begin
[1:23:37] because the more you listen to it the
[1:23:40] more you realize who you are the more
[1:23:42] you see your name the more you you begin
[1:23:45] overcoming
[1:23:47] hallelujah
[1:23:49] amen the bride loves the world
[1:23:53] the bride is the word.
[1:23:56] The bride enjoys the word.
[1:23:59] That's who we are.
[1:24:02] Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] Amen. When it begins to sound, the
[1:24:06] mystery of God is finished.
[1:24:09] Hallelujah. So I said the mystery is
[1:24:11] finished.
[1:24:13] I say it is finished.
[1:24:16] No more revelation.
[1:24:18] It's all here.
[1:24:24] What is it?
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[1:24:29] What is the mystery?
[1:24:31] The mystery is not coming.
[1:24:33] The mystery is here. The mystery is
[1:24:36] Christ in you.
[1:24:39] The hope of glory.
[1:24:43] What do you say pastor? Even the others
[1:24:45] say that's true.
[1:24:48] No,
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; there's a big difference.
[1:24:51] They think when they speak in tongues
[1:24:55] and when the anointing comes on them
[1:24:57] they fall.
[1:24:58] They think that that's the Holy Spirit.
[1:25:02] But that's why they missed it.
[1:25:06] They think it's the Holy Ghost. Yes, it
[1:25:08] is the Holy Ghost. The anointing of the
[1:25:11] Holy Ghost
[1:25:14] on their
[1:25:17] on their spirit.
[1:25:20] Are you following me? But you can have
[1:25:24] all the anointing you want
[1:25:27] but remain a seed.
[1:25:31] Remain an unjust source.
[1:25:35] When you have the anointing, you can
[1:25:38] preach, you can do miracles, signs and
[1:25:40] wonders and all the things, but you
[1:25:43] still believe in women preaching.
[1:25:46] You still paint yourself like Jezebel.
[1:25:49] And yet you have all the anointing.
[1:25:53] You you can you can have the anointing
[1:25:56] and still dress skimpy clothes.
[1:26:00] We see it. It's the truth.
[1:26:05] Still marry more than one woman.
[1:26:08] And you say it doesn't matter what I do.
[1:26:16] It is what is in me. No, what you are
[1:26:19] doing is because of what is in you.
[1:26:25] So it is true what you do doesn't
[1:26:27] matter.
[1:26:29] But what you do is not done by you.
[1:26:33] That's why it doesn't matter. It is done
[1:26:35] by what is in you.
[1:26:38] Jesus said what enters into a man
[1:26:40] doesn't defile him.
[1:26:43] But what comes out of you
[1:26:46] that defiles him.
[1:26:48] So what a person does,
[1:26:50] how you speak, how you relate with
[1:26:53] others, how you dress,
[1:26:56] how you you which songs you listen to,
[1:27:00] the appetite you have.
[1:27:03] It shows what is in you.
[1:27:06] It is either Christ or Satan.
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:11] It's either the world or the Lord.
[1:27:15] And let me tell you my brother and my
[1:27:16] sister. Amen. It's only the word which
[1:27:20] can regenerate you.
[1:27:22] Amen. And Christ is the word. Christ
[1:27:25] cannot go against his own word.
[1:27:30] You cannot receive the true genuine Holy
[1:27:32] Ghost
[1:27:34] and you refuse water baptism in the name
[1:27:36] of Jesus.
[1:27:39] It shows what is in you
[1:27:42] is not the word.
[1:27:44] And so my friend, that's the difference.
[1:27:48] Christ in you will always agree with the
[1:27:51] word.
[1:27:53] Show me a people.
[1:27:55] Show me a people that believe the word.
[1:27:59] The whole world with a life following
[1:28:04] with a life following. And I will show
[1:28:06] you the bride.
[1:28:09] Hallelujah. Amen. A bride that is in the
[1:28:12] image.
[1:28:13] that was lost but now restored.
[1:28:17] Do you know we are walking in a new
[1:28:19] image?
[1:28:22] The image which Adam lost
[1:28:25] because whatever Adam lost has been
[1:28:28] restored
[1:28:30] back again to us.
[1:28:32] We are not a normal people.
[1:28:36] We are supernatural.
[1:28:38] We are walking
[1:28:41] in in the image of the first man
[1:28:45] before the fall. Amen. Before Genesis uh
[1:28:49] you know two,
[1:28:51] we are walking in Genesis 1.
[1:28:57] We are walking in Genesis 1
[1:29:00] which is a man when God said let there
[1:29:04] be a man in my own image in our own
[1:29:09] image. And the Bible says so God created
[1:29:13] man in his own image in his own image.
[1:29:18] Created he him
[1:29:21] male and female. Listen church. That man
[1:29:25] was not a fleshy man.
[1:29:28] That man was a spirit man. That man, his
[1:29:32] will was aligned with the will of the
[1:29:35] father.
[1:29:38] That man, Amen, could never break the
[1:29:41] word.
[1:29:42] That man could keep, amen, the trust
[1:29:45] that was given to him.
[1:29:49] We are not just restored to Genesis 2
[1:29:53] because in Genesis 2 we can fall again.
[1:30:00] The man who lost it
[1:30:03] was Genesis 2 and he lost the sacred
[1:30:06] trust.
[1:30:08] But the man of Genesis 1
[1:30:12] cannot
[1:30:13] cannot.
[1:30:15] Why? because he's in a perfect image of
[1:30:18] God. Hallelujah.
[1:30:22] He's aligned.
[1:30:24] His will is aligned with the will of
[1:30:26] God.
[1:30:29] Let me tell you, brother, you may not
[1:30:31] feel it right now. Because you are in
[1:30:34] this flesh, but we are not feeding the
[1:30:37] flesh. The word we have received. The
[1:30:40] revealed word, the spoken word is feed
[1:30:44] in the soul. Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; And that soul
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; has been restored
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; back again into the original image.
[1:30:54] And soon you're doubting that you just
[1:30:58] wait soon and very soon we shall drop
[1:31:02] this place and we will walk into our
[1:31:07] Why are we so happy now? Because this
[1:31:10] word
[1:31:11] unites us with our theophony.
[1:31:19] Each of us has a theopha.
[1:31:22] And when we hear the word, we are
[1:31:24] hearing a portion of the other body.
[1:31:29] We are getting connected.
[1:31:31] We are getting connected.
[1:31:33] Amen. Amen. And the Bible says, "If that
[1:31:36] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:31:39] dead, who are in you, he shall quicken
[1:31:43] your mortal body."
[1:31:45] Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Soon and very soon, our bodies are going
[1:31:50] to be quickened.
[1:31:52] Right now, they can be quickened
[1:31:54] until we speak a new language
[1:31:58] and we speak in tongues.
[1:32:01] Amen. It can be quickened and we
[1:32:04] prophesy and we interpret. But there is
[1:32:08] a higher picking,
[1:32:11] a real one
[1:32:13] which will make us drop these robes of
[1:32:16] flesh
[1:32:19] and we put on immortality.
[1:32:22] I am waiting for that moment.
[1:32:25] It might as well be the next minute.
[1:32:29] Rather, let us feed on the water and
[1:32:31] enjoy.
[1:32:32] Because the more we receive,
[1:32:35] Amen, we are changing,
[1:32:38] changing, changing, changing. This word
[1:32:41] is our sacred trust.
[1:32:47] Hallelujah. Adam was given this sac
[1:32:49] trust.
[1:32:51] Adam lost it. But I tell you brother,
[1:32:55] after the opening of the seat,
[1:32:58] we cannot lose this sacrifice.
[1:33:04] Hallelujah. We cannot fall.
[1:33:07] But the Bible says she cannot fall.
[1:33:12] The first Eve fell.
[1:33:14] But this Eve cannot fall.
[1:33:17] Why? Because we have been restored.
[1:33:23] Praise God.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; You see, she has been given this secret
[1:33:34] trust
[1:33:36] that she cannot must not break
[1:33:39] and brother Bam then begins to talk
[1:33:41] about a woman
[1:33:43] and you know we are spiritually we are
[1:33:44] the woman
[1:33:46] and and he says she has been given a a
[1:33:49] circuit trust of womanhood.
[1:33:53] um to act her character
[1:33:56] to raise her children to be honorable to
[1:33:59] her husband.
[1:34:01] What a secret trust.
[1:34:03] What a responsibility to a woman.
[1:34:07] Now she she see why she's a type of the
[1:34:10] church
[1:34:12] which is the same responsibility
[1:34:16] as a woman has a sacred responsibility
[1:34:18] to her motherhood.
[1:34:23] to have virtues to her husband.
[1:34:27] The church has a sacred responsibility,
[1:34:32] to prayer, to the word, and to Christ.
[1:34:36] Just the same as the woman has.
[1:34:40] I want to make three things here that
[1:34:42] she must not get away from.
[1:34:46] Now, I'm speaking. can keep the church
[1:34:48] in mind while I'm speaking this to the
[1:34:50] natural woman.
[1:34:57] She has a secret trust of virtue
[1:34:59] committed to her by her lord,
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:05] a certain virtue.
[1:35:08] Nothing else holds it but a woman.
[1:35:13] It's committed to her by God. She must
[1:35:15] not defile that virtue.
[1:35:19] If she even does something wrong,
[1:35:26] she must confess that to her husband
[1:35:27] before she he takes her
[1:35:31] and make it right.
[1:35:33] The same as the church that was married
[1:35:35] to the law,
[1:35:39] it has to come also before Christ before
[1:35:41] the second marriage. She has to confess
[1:35:42] that
[1:35:46] if she doesn't and she lives with her
[1:35:47] husband for 10 years and then confess
[1:35:49] it, he has a right to put her away and
[1:35:51] marry another woman.
[1:35:59] If a woman is not yet married
[1:36:02] and she goes and do bad things,
[1:36:06] she doesn't tell the husband who's
[1:36:09] after 10 years later and tells him they
[1:36:13] forgive me.
[1:36:15] I lied to you because I was fearing.
[1:36:19] I thought you will leave me but I was
[1:36:22] not. I lied.
[1:36:26] I had even done abortion. I had even
[1:36:27] done this and that
[1:36:31] brother
[1:36:33] even if it is 10 years
[1:36:36] the man can chase that woman and marry
[1:36:38] another one. Now why? Because it's only
[1:36:43] a woman
[1:36:46] that has been given that virtue.
[1:36:50] She can say no
[1:36:53] or yes.
[1:36:56] If she doesn't and she lives with
[1:36:58] husband for 10 years and confess it,
[1:37:03] he has a right to marry another woman.
[1:37:06] That's the scripture. Fornication is
[1:37:08] living.
[1:37:11] She had a sacred trust of the virtue
[1:37:13] that's been given her
[1:37:16] trusted to her by the Lord.
[1:37:20] God gave her that virtue
[1:37:22] just as it was in the garden of Eden.
[1:37:24] She can say yes or no.
[1:37:30] You know when she got this baby, she
[1:37:31] said, "I've gotten a man from the Lord."
[1:37:37] But she knew where the child came from,
[1:37:40] from the serpent.
[1:37:42] She mad has a virtue.
[1:37:45] The Bible says, "So, so is the way of an
[1:37:47] adulterous woman.
[1:37:50] She eatth and wipeth her mouth
[1:37:53] and says, "I've done no evil."
[1:37:56] But we know the evil was adultery.
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:37:59] She has a circle trust of womanh who
[1:38:02] committed to her
[1:38:04] that she must not break.
[1:38:08] The woman I'm speaking of here is her
[1:38:10] conduct.
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:14] her character around men.
[1:38:18] Amen. Looks you know look look on these
[1:38:22] screens and see these movie stars
[1:38:26] kissing and hugging and slopping
[1:38:30] and around over these women.
[1:38:33] A woman does that is of a bad character.
[1:38:37] She might be virtuous otherwise
[1:38:41] but see in her heart
[1:38:44] when those sex glands and in the lips
[1:38:46] the man kisses a woman's actually
[1:38:48] potentially committed adultery.
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:38:55] Sex glands are in the in in a woman's
[1:38:57] lips and in a man's lips. He could kiss
[1:38:59] her on the hand. It would be it wouldn't
[1:39:01] mix with that sex grants. But the sex
[1:39:03] grants is in the lips and see all this
[1:39:06] nonsense and the Hollywood today of all
[1:39:09] this flopping and laughing around with
[1:39:11] women and so forth and little girls
[1:39:13] looking at all that.
[1:39:19] No wonder our morals are rotten and
[1:39:22] decayed
[1:39:25] and filthy because it is put before the
[1:39:28] children.
[1:39:31] It has to be that way for the last day.
[1:39:36] Now keep the church in mind.
[1:39:39] The church is kissing and slopping and
[1:39:42] mixing around in everything else but the
[1:39:44] word.
[1:39:52] Look at the way they dress. Hear the
[1:39:54] songs they sing.
[1:39:59] But they call themselves the church of
[1:40:00] Christ. mixing and slapping with the
[1:40:03] world
[1:40:06] but not the word.
[1:40:09] You see they led the devil and education
[1:40:11] and scientific searches and so forth.
[1:40:16] She has this secret womanhood.
[1:40:20] No wonder that men act around women the
[1:40:22] way they do.
[1:40:25] Is because women act around men the way
[1:40:27] they do.
[1:40:30] She characters herself out here with a
[1:40:32] pair of shorts on and skirt tight and
[1:40:34] men's clothes and things
[1:40:40] out on the street
[1:40:42] twisting around
[1:40:44] no matter what she says.
[1:40:47] She might be as virtuous to her husband
[1:40:49] as she can be,
[1:40:52] but in the sight of God, she is an
[1:40:55] adulteress.
[1:40:57] Whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[1:40:59] after her
[1:41:02] has committed adultery with her already
[1:41:06] and she presented herself to be that
[1:41:11] and that's exactly what the church has
[1:41:13] done with the world
[1:41:16] that's committed to her three things
[1:41:20] virtue
[1:41:22] s womanhood
[1:41:25] and then s motherhood
[1:41:28] to honor her husband.
[1:41:31] But the women of these days don't have
[1:41:33] those virtues.
[1:41:35] They have lost those sacred virtues.
[1:41:39] Just like the church has lost those,
[1:41:44] the church of England has voted a woman
[1:41:47] to be the archbishop of Canterbury.
[1:41:55] Even the Catholic church knows better.
[1:42:00] They know better.
[1:42:03] That's why you see the Pentecostals,
[1:42:04] they do things which even the Catholic
[1:42:05] church cannot do.
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:10] The Pentecostal pastors and churches
[1:42:13] are doing things that even the Anglicans
[1:42:16] are suppressed.
[1:42:20] And the anglicans are doing things that
[1:42:23] even the Catholics say
[1:42:27] why the more revelation
[1:42:31] but without the life
[1:42:34] the worse they become.
[1:42:37] That's why I'm not surprised if they can
[1:42:40] even be in the message believe the
[1:42:41] message
[1:42:44] and and and and be worse than even the
[1:42:47] Pentecost.
[1:42:50] Let me tell you church, the message we
[1:42:52] believe
[1:42:54] is a real message.
[1:42:56] Is a true message is a true word. But
[1:43:00] let me tell you the truth. If you It
[1:43:02] doesn't change you
[1:43:05] to be the best.
[1:43:08] You will become the worst.
[1:43:11] So choose. Which direction will you
[1:43:13] take? As for me, I want to be the best.
[1:43:18] I want to receive this word. Amen. I
[1:43:21] don't want the devil to dilute me in any
[1:43:23] way.
[1:43:26] I want to stand with the word. As long
[1:43:28] as the word says something,
[1:43:31] I want to say amen.
[1:43:33] I believe it. I want to live by it. I
[1:43:37] don't want to live half-hazardly.
[1:43:40] I I don't want to live as uh somebody
[1:43:43] who doesn't know where I am going.
[1:43:46] I want to say I know who I am. I know
[1:43:50] where I stand and I know where I am
[1:43:52] going. I have this secret virtue
[1:43:56] of the word which the Lord has entrusted
[1:43:59] me with.
[1:44:01] I want to believe it with all my heart.
[1:44:04] I don't want to shift it or or
[1:44:07] compromise here, compromise there.
[1:44:11] It's a a sacred virtue
[1:44:14] that we have been given.
[1:44:17] Praise God. We cannot replace it with
[1:44:20] manmade creatures and wisdom and
[1:44:22] denominations and
[1:44:25] it is either the word
[1:44:27] or it is nothing.
[1:44:29] Praise God. Praise God. We we should not
[1:44:34] compromise.
[1:44:36] Let us stay with the word.
[1:44:38] Let us believe the word even when the
[1:44:41] situation becomes tough.
[1:44:43] Brothers, stay with the word. Sisters,
[1:44:45] stay with the word
[1:44:48] because it's a sacred virtue.
[1:44:55] The trust which has been given to you,
[1:44:58] if you hold this word faithfully,
[1:45:02] the Lord will bless you. He will
[1:45:04] increase you.
[1:45:07] Amen. Don't compromise it.
[1:45:10] Don't compromise it
[1:45:13] for anything. Whatever you need, if you
[1:45:16] are faithful
[1:45:19] with the principles of the word, you
[1:45:21] will receive it. Hallelujah. It's not a
[1:45:24] doubt. There's no doubt. If you want to
[1:45:27] be married,
[1:45:29] it's a desire. The word says he will
[1:45:33] give you whatsoever things you desire.
[1:45:37] So if you have a desire, check yourself.
[1:45:40] How are you standing with the word?
[1:45:44] Hallelujah.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; If you're standing
[1:45:47] like that,
[1:45:49] correct yourself.
[1:45:52] Put yourself in tune
[1:45:54] and then request your desire. He said, I
[1:45:57] will give you whatever you desire.
[1:46:00] If you want a job, if you want
[1:46:02] promotion, whatever you desire,
[1:46:05] everything is in the word.
[1:46:08] No compromise.
[1:46:09] We stand with the word and we will see
[1:46:12] his blessing. If you have not tested,
[1:46:16] some have tested
[1:46:18] and we have seen that the Lord is good
[1:46:21] and he will give you everything.
[1:46:25] Tell your neighbor, he will give you
[1:46:26] everything.
[1:46:28] He will give you everything.
[1:46:30] God bless you. You can stand up on your
[1:46:33] feet.
[1:46:35] Hallelujah. Let's give him a clap of
[1:46:37] praise.
[1:46:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; That's not enough for the Lord now. Come
[1:46:42] on, give him a cup of praise.
[1:46:45] [Applause]
[1:46:50] Hallelujah.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:46:54] There is a way. Well, I sought the Lord
[1:47:01] and he answered me. Give us the words,
[1:47:05] brother.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; And delivered me
[1:47:11] from Mary.
[1:47:16] Those who look on him,
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:26] they'll never be ashamed.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. There'll never be

[1:47:51] my enemy.
